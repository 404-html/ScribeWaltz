1
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:10,540
So I'm pleased to introduce Dr Eric
Chudler who has a bs Ms and phd in

2
00:00:11,391 --> 00:00:16,391
psychology from Udab where he's the
executive director for the center of since

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,940
sensory motor neural
engineering at the udub.

4
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:25,340
He's a research associate professor in
the Department of bioengineering and

5
00:00:25,341 --> 00:00:27,410
anesthesiology and pain medicine.

6
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:32,210
He is investigating the
neuroactive properties of
medicinal herbs and plants to

7
00:00:32,211 --> 00:00:36,620
help treat neurological disease.
And Dr Leads Johnson,

8
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:42,170
I hope I pronounce both your
names correctly. I didn't.
Oh, great man. Um, who,

9
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:45,500
who is a research scientist in the
department of neurological surgery.

10
00:00:45,501 --> 00:00:50,501
She has a bs in physics and a phd
in biomed biomedical engineering.

11
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:55,990
She is broadly interested in ECR based
brain based brain computer interfaces,

12
00:00:58,041 --> 00:01:01,010
specifically in how the brain
changes in response to training.

13
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:06,290
They both share a passion for helping
improve science literacy and education as

14
00:01:06,291 --> 00:01:09,050
well as developing the next
generation of scientists.

15
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:12,020
They here to talk about their book,
Brain Bites,

16
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:16,370
quick answers to quirky questions about
the brain. Please join me and give them,

17
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:17,263
give them a warmup.

18
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:22,430
[inaudible]

19
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:23,913
okay,

20
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:28,940
well thank you David and thank you to
a Google for inviting us here today.

21
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,920
Uh, all that stuff that David mentioned
introducing us means that we're really

22
00:01:33,921 --> 00:01:35,210
interested in how the brain works.

23
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:39,590
Both Lisa and I are are neuroscientists
at the University of Washington. Uh,

24
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:43,880
we work at the center for sensorimotor
neuroengineering where we're developing a

25
00:01:43,881 --> 00:01:47,210
bi-directional brain computer interface
to help people with neurological

26
00:01:47,211 --> 00:01:51,050
problems, especially those with
stroke and spinal cord injury.

27
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:55,070
And today we're going to talk
about, uh, how your brain works.

28
00:01:55,071 --> 00:01:59,540
So maybe we'll take it back to your high
school or you're a university level, uh,

29
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:01,550
neuroscience courses of
your biology courses.

30
00:02:01,551 --> 00:02:03,320
We'll find out what you
know about the brain,

31
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:07,820
but just be a quick introduction
to the brain. And then,

32
00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:08,600
uh,

33
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:12,710
Dr. Johnson and I have picked out two
of our favorite things to talk about the

34
00:02:12,711 --> 00:02:16,550
brain. I'll talk about, does the
full moon make people go crazy?

35
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:19,220
And then we'll get some of
your opinions as well. Uh,

36
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:23,170
at least we'll talk about a
brain computer interfaces. Uh,

37
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,810
and then we'll just open up
for questions. Um, so, uh,

38
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:31,000
the plan is to introduce your brain
and when you think about the brain, uh,

39
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:34,770
the brand does about everything.
Uh, that's important to you. So, uh,

40
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:38,780
right now I'm moving, I'm
speaking, my heart is pumping,

41
00:02:38,781 --> 00:02:43,760
my lungs are going in and out
there.

42
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:47,030
I lost my mind for a little
while. Sorry. Uh, uh,

43
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:49,530
but you bring it does just about
everything that's important to you. Uh,

44
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:52,820
it controls your emotions.
It controls all your movement.

45
00:02:52,821 --> 00:02:54,560
And Crow controls were five senses.

46
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:58,100
Even though sense is that we don't even
think about our brain is helping us do.

47
00:02:58,101 --> 00:02:59,770
So if you go ahead and put
your out in front of you,

48
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:04,210
and if you're wasn't your brain
telling you to put your arm out there,

49
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:08,650
if you couldn't see your arm, you still
get information about where your arm is.

50
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:10,870
Because after a while your arms
are gonna start hurting, right?

51
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:13,150
And so that part of your
body is your muscles.

52
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:16,780
So your muscles have sensory organs in
it that sends information to your spinal

53
00:03:16,781 --> 00:03:19,450
cord and up to your brain.
Also in all of your joints,

54
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:23,650
your joints have sensory receptors and
them to tell where your arms are in space

55
00:03:23,651 --> 00:03:28,060
and your legs are in space. Uh, hopefully
the words coming out of my mouth though,

56
00:03:28,061 --> 00:03:32,290
sound pressure is changing and
it gets into your ear, your ear,

57
00:03:32,291 --> 00:03:36,310
then your eardrum vibrates. If
those three bones, your ear vibrate,

58
00:03:36,311 --> 00:03:39,760
they send messages to the auditory nerve
that are getting to your brain so that

59
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:43,400
you understand the words that
are coming out of my mouth. Uh,

60
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:46,450
so the brain is really, I think, the
most important part of your body.

61
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:48,730
And you really can't do without a brand,
uh,

62
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:50,830
like you can do without
other parts of your body.

63
00:03:50,831 --> 00:03:53,800
And I think it's the most interesting
part of the body. So can you live,

64
00:03:53,801 --> 00:03:58,710
for example, without a kidney?
Yeah. You can live without a kidney.

65
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:03,270
Can you live without a couple of feet
of intestine? Yeah. You got, you know,

66
00:04:03,271 --> 00:04:06,480
20 or so feet of a test you could do
though. Can you live without your heart?

67
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:12,880
Yeah, sure you can. You can
live without your heart, right?

68
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:16,530
You can't live without a heart.
Right. And what about brain?

69
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:21,410
Can you live without your
brain? Can you maybe, maybe,

70
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:26,150
maybe not, maybe not, not,
not, not yet. Not yet.

71
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:29,040
Uh, and, uh, an interesting, uh,

72
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:33,390
question comes up that is if you could
take a brain and you can take this brand

73
00:04:33,391 --> 00:04:35,000
and you can put it someplace else,

74
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:38,330
would you be where your body is or
would you be where your brain is?

75
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:40,970
Do

76
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:44,240
Neither. So some people would say,
neither. Some people would say,

77
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:48,050
I would be where my brain is. Some people
would say, well, no, my body is who I am.

78
00:04:48,051 --> 00:04:51,680
And that's when I see myself, that's
who I am. And some people would say,

79
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:54,770
maybe you're not, uh, maybe
you're somewhere in between.

80
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:58,580
A one project that I've been doing for
the last six years is that from going to

81
00:04:58,581 --> 00:05:02,480
India where I've been teaching
Tibet and Buddhist monks and nuns,

82
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:07,270
western neuroscience. And the first
question that they asked me is, uh,

83
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:11,720
Doctor Chub Lou, when, uh, when
you die, where does the mind go?

84
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:17,210
And I said, that's it. That's
a really interesting question.
Um, but as a scientist,

85
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:19,880
I don't have an answer to
that. Uh, as a scientist,

86
00:05:19,881 --> 00:05:24,110
I need to devise an experiment that will
test that hypothesis. And I don't know,

87
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:27,140
an experiment that can be
done to test that hypothesis.

88
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:29,750
So what happens when you take a
brand and you put it someplace else?

89
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:30,860
Where is the mind to,

90
00:05:30,861 --> 00:05:35,780
I don't know if I don't have an
answer for you at this time. Um,

91
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:39,830
but if you look at the brain,
we know that when you change the brand,

92
00:05:39,831 --> 00:05:42,350
you also change various
aspects of the mind.

93
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:47,060
And one very important part is
this outside rind of the brand.

94
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:49,090
Does anybody know the name
of this outside partner?

95
00:05:49,091 --> 00:05:54,080
We were channel your high school or your,
your university nursing. What's that? Uh,

96
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:57,050
not time for the cerebellum yet.
Cause it's folded outside. Part

97
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:01,430
frontal cortex would be the front
part of the brand. And so in general,

98
00:06:01,431 --> 00:06:05,420
this general area without the frontal
would be the, that would be the cortex.

99
00:06:05,421 --> 00:06:09,200
The cerebral cortex and cortex comes
from the Latin word, meaning bark,

100
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:14,270
not of a tree, but of the bark,
the outside rind of the cortex.

101
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:19,270
And you can actually see how that camp
of that cortex kind of does cover that

102
00:06:19,731 --> 00:06:24,380
entire part of the brain. Uh, so inside
the brain we also have a strip here.

103
00:06:24,381 --> 00:06:25,430
It's not labeled here,

104
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:29,420
but this is that a 200 million axons,

105
00:06:29,421 --> 00:06:32,240
which connect the right and left
hemisphere. It's got two words to it.

106
00:06:32,241 --> 00:06:33,530
Both start with the letter c,

107
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:38,510
anybody that's the corpus
callosum connecting the left
and the right hemisphere.

108
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:41,660
And this area here, it's
uh, it's sort of central.

109
00:06:41,661 --> 00:06:45,950
It sends information up to the CORTEX
and also gets information from the spinal

110
00:06:45,951 --> 00:06:50,180
cord as well. Kind of a
relay sensory information to
various parts of the CORTEX.

111
00:06:50,181 --> 00:06:52,000
The cortex also receives part of it.

112
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:56,110
It doesn't make me the name of
that starts with the letter t, t.

113
00:06:56,120 --> 00:07:00,230
H that's the founders. That's
right. That's the Thalamus here.

114
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:02,360
And so if that's the thalamus there,

115
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:05,750
below the thalamus would be what?

116
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:09,260
That would be the hypothalamus.
Thank you. And this part here,

117
00:07:09,261 --> 00:07:11,330
the middle part of the brain and neck,
it's a big hint.

118
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,300
It's the middle part of the brain.
So it's what,

119
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:15,640
okay,

120
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:16,930
the middle.
What's that?

121
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:18,843
Hmm.

122
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:23,780
So obviously the midbrain, that's what
it's called. That's the midbrain there.

123
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:26,660
And then this cauliflower like thing
on the back. If I was juggling,

124
00:07:26,661 --> 00:07:28,310
lean on one foot and hopping up and down,

125
00:07:28,311 --> 00:07:30,080
this part of the brain
would be very active.

126
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:31,940
Also helps me with my balance and posture.

127
00:07:31,941 --> 00:07:35,120
Now is the time for now's
the time for cerebellum.

128
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:38,750
So that's about 10% of your
brain and the cerebellum here.

129
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:41,730
And then from about this area
to the top of the spinal cord,

130
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,820
it would be like the
bottom part of the flower,

131
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,700
which would make it the brand
that would make it the brainstem.

132
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:50,630
And inside the brand step is
one area called the Medulla.

133
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:53,480
And uh, for them, some of
you that are old like me,

134
00:07:53,481 --> 00:07:55,880
may have seen the movie
with a Adam Sandler.

135
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:59,150
How many have you seen waterboy come on,
you can admit it.

136
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:01,610
Now I have to watch all these movies
for scientific reasons, but there's one,

137
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:05,000
there's one scene in, in
waterboy with uh, the, uh,

138
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:07,550
professors talking about how,
uh,

139
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:12,590
alligators have a large Medulla Oblongata.
And if you remember this scene,

140
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:14,010
uh, he says it's, they have a large,

141
00:08:14,011 --> 00:08:16,700
we do a lot of work on and that's
why alligators are always angry,

142
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:21,470
implying that the medulla has some
important function for emotional behavior,

143
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:24,860
which I don't know if,
I don't know evidence that that's true.

144
00:08:24,861 --> 00:08:28,890
So I would suggest not to get your science
from especially maybe adding Sandra

145
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:32,930
or Hollywood. Uh, and now what about
the Brian? This is an average size,

146
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:36,480
a model of the brain, uh, about how much
is an average adult human brain where,

147
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,153
all right,

148
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:42,010
so I think three pounds and the
other guesses, two and a half,

149
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:46,660
two and a half kilos.
So that's about six pounds or so.

150
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,140
Yeah.

151
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:52,680
Any other guesses?
One of those answers is correct.

152
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:57,780
So, so, so on average average adult
human brain weighs about three pounds,

153
00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:00,990
almost three pounds.
And I always bring this up and,

154
00:09:00,991 --> 00:09:05,130
and I guess no one ever saw
it about two years ago on TV,

155
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:07,950
there was a TV show.
It was like a drama.

156
00:09:07,951 --> 00:09:11,130
And I don't know if it was a drama or
a comedy, it was called three pounds.

157
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:14,370
It was on for like three episodes,
I think on CBS.

158
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:17,080
Anybody see that movie called three
pounds? Now? Nobody's watched.

159
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,090
That's why it's not on anymore.

160
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,710
It was all about a neurosurgeon
and then called it three pounds.

161
00:09:22,711 --> 00:09:26,600
I assumed because the adult human
brain weighs about three pounds a.

162
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:28,650
What about gender or sex?

163
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,230
Are there any differences between
male and female brain weights?

164
00:09:31,231 --> 00:09:34,530
You take a brand new prop and on a
scale and you weigh it. On average,

165
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:39,680
our average male brains heavier than
male than female brains or female brains

166
00:09:39,901 --> 00:09:41,670
heavy than male brands,
or do they weigh about the same?

167
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:47,670
So raise your hand if you think on
average an average adult male brain weighs

168
00:09:47,671 --> 00:09:50,940
more than an average adult or
female brain. So a few people.

169
00:09:50,941 --> 00:09:54,090
How about on average female brains?
Way more than male brains.

170
00:09:55,380 --> 00:10:00,300
And how about on average? The way about
the same. Okay, so let's look at some, um,

171
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:02,670
some real data.
So on this graph here,

172
00:10:02,671 --> 00:10:07,170
on the x axis is how old someone
is on the y axis is brain weight.

173
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:10,890
Three pounds is about 1.4 kilograms.
So you can see there,

174
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,570
uh,

175
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:16,200
the red bars are male brain weights
and blue or female brain weights.

176
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:17,460
What does this graph show?

177
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,960
So females have smaller brands in men.

178
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:26,040
I want showed this graph to a group of
fourth graders and the fourth graders,

179
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:29,190
they were able to understand the x and
the y and they can see that some bars

180
00:10:29,191 --> 00:10:32,350
were bigger than the other and they
can see that the red bars were larger.

181
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,710
And I called him this little boy and
I said, what does this graph show?

182
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:38,070
And the boy, you know, he's very
confident. He raises his hand and he says,

183
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:41,850
this graph shows that men
are smarter than women.

184
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:45,820
And I said something
scientific like, uh, you know,

185
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:48,810
that's a very interesting interpretation
of this data. I don't know exactly,

186
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:50,670
I don't know exactly what
I said, but I, you know,

187
00:10:50,671 --> 00:10:53,400
I didn't want to make fun of him and
I didn't want to say who, you know,

188
00:10:53,401 --> 00:10:54,750
you're wrong,
but I,

189
00:10:54,751 --> 00:10:59,100
I did say that this graph doesn't say
anything about how smart someone is the

190
00:10:59,101 --> 00:11:02,910
same graph. I showed her a group of
science teachers and one of the teachers,

191
00:11:02,911 --> 00:11:06,930
she was giving me the, Oh, you know,
raising her hand and not letting me speak.

192
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:10,200
And I say, what's wrong? You know,
you have to take a cell phone call,

193
00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:13,050
you have to go out, you know
what's wrong? And she said,

194
00:11:13,051 --> 00:11:16,470
you should never show this picture. And
I said, why should I show this picture?

195
00:11:16,471 --> 00:11:19,780
This has been published a long time ago.
It's been replicated many times. This is,

196
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:22,470
this is a fact. Why shouldn't
I show this picture? She said,

197
00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:25,650
you're trying to show that men are
smarter than women. And I said,

198
00:11:25,651 --> 00:11:28,920
this graph doesn't say anything about
how smart somewhere knows. And in fact,

199
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:30,870
this next graph has exact same data,

200
00:11:30,871 --> 00:11:34,200
but it's plotted how large the brain
is in proportion to the whole body.

201
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,910
So this is brain body ratio.

202
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,760
So how large the brain is in
relation to the whole body.

203
00:11:38,761 --> 00:11:41,220
So if I weigh 150 pounds in,
my brain weighs three pounds,

204
00:11:41,221 --> 00:11:46,110
that means my brain is 2% of my total body
weight. Now when you look at the data,

205
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:50,280
there's almost no differences.
All right? Uh, and, uh,

206
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:54,010
even this graph doesn't say anything
about how smart some, because look,

207
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:58,540
a newborn baby and newborn baby's brain
is 13% of their total body weight.

208
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,910
And so, uh, you, uh,

209
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:05,800
who anybody here who has a little infants
at home or have seen babies know that

210
00:12:05,801 --> 00:12:10,030
those babies have giant balloon
heads, right? Little bodies, right?

211
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:14,990
Their brains are 30% of how much
they were. And so just because, uh,

212
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:16,720
someone has a large brand,

213
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:19,630
has a larger brain from a portion of
their body says nothing about their

214
00:12:19,631 --> 00:12:23,690
intelligence. Uh, we are not the animals
on earth with the largest brains. Uh,

215
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:24,431
elephants,

216
00:12:24,431 --> 00:12:29,431
dolphins and whales have large
absolute brain sizes than we do.

217
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:32,380
We're not the animals on earth with
the largest brains in proportion to our

218
00:12:32,381 --> 00:12:36,010
bodies. There's a several
animals. One is a hummingbird.

219
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,320
Hummingbirds have larger
brains for their body.

220
00:12:38,321 --> 00:12:42,880
And there's another little African knife
fish. It's only about this big. And, uh,

221
00:12:42,881 --> 00:12:46,330
again, tiny, tiny little brains,
but in proportion to their body,

222
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:50,280
they're larger than they are in us humans.
So it goes to the question,

223
00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:51,790
what does it mean to be intelligent?

224
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:56,730
And we can talk a little bit about
that after as well. So the brain, uh,

225
00:12:57,060 --> 00:13:00,460
is made up, is about three
pounds, 1.4 kilograms.

226
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:03,520
It's made up of special cells
called neurons or nerve cells.

227
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:06,670
And there's a whole lot of
those 86 to 100 billion.

228
00:13:06,671 --> 00:13:09,080
We're just rounding up to a 100 billion,
but what's,

229
00:13:09,081 --> 00:13:13,930
what's 14 billion between friends, right?
Uh, and they have those special parts.

230
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:16,860
They have dendrites receive
information from other cells, uh,

231
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:20,230
from other nerve cells.
They send that information to a cell body,

232
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:24,190
cell bodies connected to a long Axon,
which is a neuro fiber,

233
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:27,430
which then can branch
two terminals at the end.

234
00:13:27,431 --> 00:13:32,230
And those terminals are very interested
because to nerve cells to communicate,

235
00:13:32,231 --> 00:13:34,450
they don't actually touch,
there's a gap,

236
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:37,150
a physical gap between new to nerve cells.

237
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:41,800
So when the terminal of one cell a wants
to talk to a dendright of another nerve

238
00:13:41,801 --> 00:13:46,420
cell, there's a space. And
so for one nerve cell to talk
to the other nerve cells,

239
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:49,570
the first nerve cell must release
the little chemical neurotransmitter.

240
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:54,040
You've probably heard some of these
dopamine, Acetylcholine, Gaba, glutamate,

241
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:55,593
Serotonin,

242
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:59,470
those are all types of chemicals that are
stored in the terminal of a nerve cell.

243
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:04,150
So each neuron is like a little battery
and then it generates a little bit of

244
00:14:04,151 --> 00:14:07,420
electricity. When that electricity
gets to the end of the nerve cell,

245
00:14:07,421 --> 00:14:09,550
it constants as chemists
calls to come out,

246
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:12,070
those chemicals cross
that small little space.

247
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:15,370
They're picked up by receptors on
the dendright of next nerve cell,

248
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:19,270
which can then increase or decrease the
likelihood I'm an electrical signal in

249
00:14:19,271 --> 00:14:22,360
that next nerve cell. And that's
how signals are sent in your brain,

250
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:28,140
electrical signals within a nerve cell
and chemical signals between nerve cells.

251
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:31,930
So if you don't remember anything,
uh, else that we have to say today,

252
00:14:31,931 --> 00:14:35,650
if you just remember that I,
I'd be very, very happy. Okay.

253
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:39,460
Electrical inside of a nerve cell
and chemical between nerve cells.

254
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:43,780
So let's talk a little bit about
what our brain does for us. Uh,

255
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:47,470
some of the basic things are taking in
sensory information from the outside

256
00:14:47,471 --> 00:14:48,010
world,

257
00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:52,700
processing that information and sending
a motor response act on that sensory

258
00:14:52,701 --> 00:14:53,510
stimulus.

259
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:56,660
And this is just a couple of animals
that do things with their senses better

260
00:14:56,661 --> 00:15:00,320
than we can do. For example, in
the upper left there is a cat.

261
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:02,410
What can a cat do with it?
Senses better than we can do.

262
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:07,550
So they have a good sense of
balance. Yeah. So, uh, don't do this,

263
00:15:07,551 --> 00:15:10,890
but if you have a cat at
home and you drop it, uh,

264
00:15:10,891 --> 00:15:14,300
it'll probably land on its feet because
it has a good sense of balance. Yeah.

265
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:17,540
They can also see in low light they
have a good sense of smell and very good

266
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:20,540
sense of hearing as well. Uh,
how about that? That Butterfly,

267
00:15:20,541 --> 00:15:22,970
what can a butterfly do?
Is it senses better than we can do?

268
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:27,410
They can see infrared is
one. Yeah, that's right.

269
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:31,970
There's one more as actually nick, not
infrared. Ultraviolet is they see it,

270
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:33,020
they see ultraviolet.

271
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:39,310
They can do one other thing in a much
more sensitive than than we can do smell.

272
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:44,000
Yeah. They have a, they can detect very
low concentrations of certain chemicals,

273
00:15:44,001 --> 00:15:47,770
pheromones in the air that we don't know
that's there. Uh, what about a shark?

274
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:52,790
Sharks have a particular sense that
humans don't have it all? Uh, yeah,

275
00:15:52,791 --> 00:15:55,020
we can smell, but, uh, I heard
someone say that they have,

276
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,930
they can detect electricity in the water,
uh,

277
00:15:57,950 --> 00:16:00,620
not because they use
refrigerators or electric razors,

278
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:05,710
but because they have the ability to
detect, uh, electricity generated by, uh,

279
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:06,613
muscles.

280
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:11,600
So that's one way that they can find
prey is by detecting electricity.

281
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:13,010
Uh,
put off by muscles.

282
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:17,330
A infrared is those snakes
a dolphin's navigate with,

283
00:16:17,331 --> 00:16:18,230
um,

284
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:22,850
echolocation sonar or the emails
also have electrode receptors,

285
00:16:22,970 --> 00:16:26,920
a chameleon I put up there because,
uh, some chameleons, you know, they,

286
00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:30,530
they had their eyes on stocks and they
can put one eye up and one or down at the

287
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:34,010
same time. I've have no idea how they
put together that visual picture,

288
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:38,090
whether they see split screen or whether
it's unfocused or I don't know what

289
00:16:38,091 --> 00:16:39,630
they see. Owls, owls,

290
00:16:39,631 --> 00:16:43,400
we have a good sense of sight
and also a good sense of vision.

291
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:47,090
But our senses are also
very easy to trick.

292
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,500
And so what I want you to do on this one,

293
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:52,070
how many of you have heard of the stroop
effect before? Just a couple of years.

294
00:16:52,071 --> 00:16:52,790
So good.

295
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:56,690
And so what I want you to do is I'm
going to point at these colors and I just

296
00:16:56,691 --> 00:16:59,270
want you to say out
loud what color you see.

297
00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:03,860
And these colors are just normal colors.
For example, the blue, it's just blue.

298
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,100
It's not a royal blue or dark
blue or navy, it's just blue.

299
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:11,450
Same with the green is not Jello Green.
It's not lime green, it's just green.

300
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:13,910
And really try, don't, don't mess
up the person sitting next to you.

301
00:17:13,911 --> 00:17:17,660
Really try to say what color you see.
Some people see this as purple.

302
00:17:17,661 --> 00:17:20,810
Some people see this pink, I don't
care. It's whatever you see. Okay.

303
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:25,610
So follow the bouncing ball and again,
say out loud what color you see. Okay.

304
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:28,820
Ready? One, two, three, go. Blue.

305
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:42,880
Good.

306
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:47,350
So just to, just to
test that one more. Uh,

307
00:17:47,351 --> 00:17:49,780
so I wonder why aren't you doing this one?
What I want you doing.

308
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:54,570
This one is do not read the word.
Tell me what color the word is.

309
00:17:54,571 --> 00:17:55,404
Printed it.

310
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:59,760
So this one on that word is printed
in black on that color that's printed.

311
00:17:59,761 --> 00:18:02,370
That's green, right? Do not read the word.

312
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:06,990
Tell me what color the word is
printed there. Okay. Ready? One, two,

313
00:18:07,050 --> 00:18:08,040
three.
Go.

314
00:18:09,290 --> 00:18:10,123
Right.

315
00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:24,200
I just checked it. Let's do it one more
time. First two are blue. Red, right.

316
00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:29,150
Okay, here we go. Ready? One, two, three,

317
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,440
go.
Blue.

318
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:47,900
Not so easy. Now let's try one more
time. Let's try this one. Ready?

319
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:51,260
One, two, three, go.

320
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:02,133
Three.

321
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:07,380
So why can you do this one and you
couldn't do the other one because are you

322
00:19:07,381 --> 00:19:12,300
getting the same information on this one
as you did from this one? Because look,

323
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:16,800
that's red. Red. This is
green. G. R. E. E. N. Y.

324
00:19:16,801 --> 00:19:18,600
Can you do this one and you
couldn't do the other one?

325
00:19:18,601 --> 00:19:21,570
Aren't you getting the same information?
Why can you do this one?

326
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:25,720
We can't do the other
one because of course,

327
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:30,420
right. It just shows that, that
we're not so good at multitasking.

328
00:19:30,421 --> 00:19:35,370
And just the simple ability of being able
to read interferes with our ability to

329
00:19:35,371 --> 00:19:37,890
name the color.
Can anybody read Japanese?

330
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:42,150
So if these were Japanese
Kanji characters for color,

331
00:19:42,810 --> 00:19:47,130
would you be able to accept for
him? Uh, would you be able to, uh,

332
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:50,850
read the color that you see? Yes.
Because it has no meaning to you,

333
00:19:50,851 --> 00:19:54,030
but because it has meaning to him, he
would probably have the same difficulty.

334
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:56,280
Right?
Uh,

335
00:19:56,430 --> 00:19:59,980
what I want you to on this one is I want
you to stare on either this one or the

336
00:19:59,981 --> 00:20:01,910
other one right there with a turquoise,

337
00:20:01,930 --> 00:20:05,610
black and yellow means I want you to look
right there and keep on staring there

338
00:20:05,611 --> 00:20:10,110
for about 10 seconds off.
Countback so keep on staring there.

339
00:20:11,370 --> 00:20:14,580
Keep on staring. I'm going to
count backwards. If you blink,

340
00:20:14,581 --> 00:20:18,720
go back to that same
spot. 10, nine, eight,

341
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:23,760
seven, six, five, four, three,

342
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:28,260
two, one. Keep on staring.
Blink once or twice

343
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:31,960
and you should see something there.

344
00:20:31,961 --> 00:20:33,640
Now what's different than
what you were staring at?

345
00:20:33,641 --> 00:20:38,230
So raise your hand if you saw the flag
of Canada. Yeah, I mean you saw the red,

346
00:20:38,231 --> 00:20:42,460
white and blue flag. So, uh, is there
a red, white and blue flag up there?

347
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:46,750
Somebody said yes. No I, there's no
red, white and blue flag up there.

348
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:50,470
Cause made this slide and I never
made it and I never put a red,

349
00:20:50,471 --> 00:20:54,280
white and blue flag up there. But you
still saw a red, white and blue flag.

350
00:20:54,910 --> 00:20:58,480
But will you agree that it's not
there but you saw one. So where is it?

351
00:20:58,481 --> 00:21:02,350
If it's not that,
I would say it's up in here.

352
00:21:02,530 --> 00:21:05,050
And what is happening there is
when you stare at that Turquoise,

353
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:09,310
yellow and black flag, you're adapting
the visual system to those turquoise,

354
00:21:09,311 --> 00:21:12,670
yellow and black colors. So when you
look at white, you're seeing white minus.

355
00:21:12,671 --> 00:21:16,780
That input from I took was the other one
black and your brain interprets that as

356
00:21:16,781 --> 00:21:20,050
red, white, and blue.
Uh, how about this one?

357
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:22,720
Now you know that they're kind of
illusions that are fooling your senses,

358
00:21:22,721 --> 00:21:26,680
but does that square look like a perfect
square or does it look like the tops

359
00:21:26,681 --> 00:21:31,060
and sides are kind of bashed down? Yeah,
you kind of see that it squeezed in,

360
00:21:31,061 --> 00:21:32,950
but even though that you
know it's an illusion,

361
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:35,980
it's very hard to not see that illusion.

362
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:40,930
How many of you on this one see a
upside down white triangle? Yeah.

363
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:43,630
So if there's an upside down
on white triangle there,

364
00:21:43,631 --> 00:21:46,300
now where is it now?

365
00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:48,000
Yeah,

366
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,010
cause I never did anything
to a white triangle.

367
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:55,820
All I did just now was removed black
lines and now I just added black lines.

368
00:21:56,700 --> 00:22:00,930
So I never edited a white triangle again.
You see a white triangle.

369
00:22:01,770 --> 00:22:05,470
Is there a white triangle up there?
Some of you are going like,

370
00:22:05,471 --> 00:22:08,710
and some of you are, I don't think
know what's going on now. Yeah.

371
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:12,040
No point triangle here.
No white square

372
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:16,410
and no white square.
Uh,

373
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:20,470
I see a white square and this one I know
there's a white skirt because I put it

374
00:22:20,471 --> 00:22:23,140
there.
Um,

375
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:27,140
so I would claim that that your
brain is just trying to help the,

376
00:22:27,290 --> 00:22:29,590
that's what the brain is doing.
It's just there to help.

377
00:22:29,770 --> 00:22:33,970
Now how about this one is a, was going
to go completely across that a rectangle.

378
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:38,710
Would it be a perfect match with B would
be a perfect match with C or maybe I'm

379
00:22:38,711 --> 00:22:41,950
trying to trick you and it's lined up
somewhere in the middle or on either side.

380
00:22:43,090 --> 00:22:46,480
So raise your hand if you think that egg
would would be a perfect match with B.

381
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:49,390
Raise your hand.
So speed people over here.

382
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:53,410
How about it's a perfect match with C
and how about I'm trying to trick it and

383
00:22:53,411 --> 00:22:56,680
match up with anywhere. See
Timmy, Timmy, Timmy, this is,

384
00:22:56,681 --> 00:23:00,970
this is fascinating because here
we have about 30 or 40 people.

385
00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:04,930
You're all looking at the same thing and
you're coming up with different answers

386
00:23:05,170 --> 00:23:07,210
and it didn't seem to be that
everybody over here said,

387
00:23:07,211 --> 00:23:09,970
hey everybody over here said B
and people over here said seats.

388
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,140
It was kind of distributed around. Why?
If you're looking at the exact same image,

389
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:15,820
are you coming up with different answers?

390
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:26,520
Because it's ambiguous. And so maybe I'm
also, maybe I'm also leading you, so,

391
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:30,810
so for example, uh, if to, to lead you
again, go ahead and put your hands,

392
00:23:31,350 --> 00:23:32,190
hands like this.

393
00:23:32,670 --> 00:23:37,230
And now what I want you to do is point
your thumbs at each other and now keep on

394
00:23:37,231 --> 00:23:38,730
rotating around,
point them down,

395
00:23:39,090 --> 00:23:42,780
and then take your right hand and put it
under your left hand and interlock your

396
00:23:42,781 --> 00:23:47,180
fingers. And as your fingers are, point
them out like that. So you don't, yeah,

397
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:49,940
I don't hit anybody in front of
you. Yeah. Okay. So with your hands,

398
00:23:49,941 --> 00:23:51,290
like this pointed out in front of you,

399
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:54,800
now all I want you to
do is rotate like this.

400
00:23:58,340 --> 00:24:03,140
Of course I did. Of course
I did. Uh, but again,

401
00:24:03,141 --> 00:24:05,350
it's just because, um, uh, because uh,

402
00:24:05,351 --> 00:24:09,140
a little distraction altered the way that
you think and altered the way that you

403
00:24:09,141 --> 00:24:12,560
perceive. And perhaps that's the same
with this one is because you have certain

404
00:24:12,561 --> 00:24:16,460
expectations and your brain is just trying
to help you make sense of the world.

405
00:24:16,610 --> 00:24:18,860
So it's uh,
it's actually a bit,

406
00:24:18,861 --> 00:24:22,040
so maybe I was trying to
trick you by trying to trick
you by trying to trick you.

407
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:25,790
All right. Uh, and as I said,
the brain is just trying to help.

408
00:24:25,791 --> 00:24:28,280
So even though your brain doesn't
get all the information it needs,

409
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:31,970
you can still read the sentences.
For example, the top line says what?

410
00:24:33,030 --> 00:24:37,460
And the bottom line says, yeah, and the
brain is just, they're trying to help you.

411
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:43,790
So even though your brain doesn't
get all the information it needs,

412
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:45,260
it is just there to help.

413
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:49,340
So I want to turn this over to Dr. Johnson
and she's going to tell you about one

414
00:24:49,341 --> 00:24:51,530
of her favorite things.
Brain computer interfaces.

415
00:24:52,730 --> 00:24:54,470
One of my favorite things,
I don't know,

416
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:57,680
raindrops and roses are
red thing right there. Um,

417
00:24:57,681 --> 00:25:02,300
so Eric asked me to put together some
slides that would be probably interesting

418
00:25:02,301 --> 00:25:04,850
and kind of about the book and I thought
we should talk about brain computer

419
00:25:04,851 --> 00:25:07,370
interfaces because it's very topical.

420
00:25:07,371 --> 00:25:09,260
If anybody's been reading
the news this morning,

421
00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:12,260
there's some stuff about brain computer
interfaces and also cause I thought this

422
00:25:12,261 --> 00:25:15,680
might be sort of a tech friendly crowd
that you guys might be into. Some of that.

423
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:20,210
So when we talk about brain
computer interfaces are BCIS,

424
00:25:20,211 --> 00:25:22,550
there's usually two categories
that we think about it.

425
00:25:22,551 --> 00:25:27,200
So the first would be motor bay, Spring
food, your interfaces, and then sensory,

426
00:25:27,201 --> 00:25:28,580
which would be kind of the opposite.

427
00:25:28,970 --> 00:25:31,190
So when you're talking
about a motor based Vci,

428
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:34,400
the first thing we need to do is measure
the electrical potential. The brain.

429
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,620
And if you guys were listening
while Eric was talking,

430
00:25:36,890 --> 00:25:41,240
he said that our brains use electricity
to communicate, which is true.

431
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:45,380
And it's also extremely convenient as
engineers because we know a little bit

432
00:25:45,381 --> 00:25:48,530
about electricity, right? So we
know how to record electricity,

433
00:25:48,531 --> 00:25:51,650
we know how to produce electricity
and that gives us some options for

434
00:25:51,651 --> 00:25:53,180
interfacing with the nervous system.

435
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:55,640
So once we've measured
that electrical potential,

436
00:25:55,730 --> 00:25:59,780
then we need to decode the
signal. So often when I give
this talk to kids, I say,

437
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,570
it doesn't come out in English and
it doesn't come out in Spanish.

438
00:26:02,571 --> 00:26:07,030
And it's like a revelation to everyone in
the room. What does it come out as? Um,

439
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:09,950
and I had a woman come up to me one time
after I gave this talk at a bookstore

440
00:26:09,951 --> 00:26:13,730
and she said, how do you do that?
Really? How do you do that? Um,

441
00:26:13,910 --> 00:26:16,880
and it turns out that you need to do a
lot of signal processing in order to do

442
00:26:16,881 --> 00:26:18,290
that.
So when we talk about decoding,

443
00:26:18,291 --> 00:26:20,030
what we're really talking
about is looking at the time,

444
00:26:20,031 --> 00:26:24,110
frequency analysis of the signal and
trying to figure out how that corresponds

445
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:26,590
to behaviors that we might observe.
Um,

446
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:30,140
then we use that decoded signals
to control an external device.

447
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:34,910
So it's a bit of a misnomer to say
it's a brain computer interface because

448
00:26:34,911 --> 00:26:38,090
sometimes the computer doesn't
really get into the mix much at all.

449
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:41,180
Then when we had the sensory device,

450
00:26:41,181 --> 00:26:43,190
we're usually going exactly
the opposite direction.

451
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:47,460
We want to measure a physical signal in
the world. So a physical signal might be

452
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,120
light, right? We could measure photons.

453
00:26:53,121 --> 00:26:57,650
So we can measure sound
and measure pressure.

454
00:26:57,651 --> 00:26:59,990
We can measure all kinds of
interesting things about the world.

455
00:26:59,991 --> 00:27:03,010
We could measure IRR if we wanted to.
Um,

456
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:06,330
then we encode the signal into
an electrical pattern, um,

457
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:09,980
which is sort of trying to figure out
the opposite of this problem and then

458
00:27:09,981 --> 00:27:11,420
electrically stimulate the brain.

459
00:27:11,421 --> 00:27:14,390
So one of the fun things about the brand
is that if you pump a little bit of

460
00:27:14,391 --> 00:27:17,600
current and you usually get some
sort of response on the other end,

461
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:22,390
if you do it in the right way, then you
can get meaningful sensory responses. Um,

462
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:23,940
and because,
uh,

463
00:27:23,990 --> 00:27:27,080
brain computer interfaces are generally
thought of is therapeutic in some way,

464
00:27:27,081 --> 00:27:30,560
then that's what we want on the other
end is a meaningful sensory response.

465
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:34,340
Um,
and while it might sound futuristic,

466
00:27:34,341 --> 00:27:38,450
there's some of these already running
around out there in the real world. Um,

467
00:27:38,451 --> 00:27:41,240
so let's go over some of the
ones that currently exist.

468
00:27:41,270 --> 00:27:45,950
Does anybody know what this is right up
here? Cochlear implant? Yes. Very good.

469
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:51,200
Um, so a cochlear implant is a stimulating
device for people that have profound

470
00:27:51,201 --> 00:27:52,670
hearing loss or deafness.

471
00:27:52,870 --> 00:27:55,840
And what you're looking at here is
just the external portion of it, um,

472
00:27:55,930 --> 00:28:00,440
which has the microphone and also
some of the signal processing parts.

473
00:28:00,441 --> 00:28:04,220
And then on the inside there's actually
an array of electrodes implanted in the

474
00:28:04,221 --> 00:28:07,950
Cochlea, which is that snail
shaped part of the inner ear. Um,

475
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:12,560
and they stimulate through the
electrodes into that space in the ear.

476
00:28:12,561 --> 00:28:17,561
It stimulates the auditory nerve
and causes the perception of sound.

477
00:28:18,270 --> 00:28:21,200
Uh, these have been around for
quite a while now, since the 80s,

478
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:26,270
and it turns out that there are so good
now that people can actually hear speech

479
00:28:26,271 --> 00:28:29,720
and identify speech even in the
absence of visual cues. So for example,

480
00:28:29,721 --> 00:28:30,620
on a telephone,

481
00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:34,620
a person with a cochlear implant would
be able to understand speech and you

482
00:28:34,621 --> 00:28:38,660
probably notice that this
person is small and bald,

483
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:42,590
meaning what? It's a baby. All right.

484
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:47,240
So why would you put a
cochlear implant in a baby?

485
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:54,780
So they will have the chance
to learn how to speak, right?

486
00:28:54,781 --> 00:28:59,160
So we have kind of all of the
facets of this answer going around.

487
00:28:59,161 --> 00:29:03,510
So the idea is that your
brain goes through critical
periods where you learn how

488
00:29:03,511 --> 00:29:06,030
to interpret different kinds
of sensory information.

489
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:09,570
And critical periods usually
happen very early in life.

490
00:29:09,571 --> 00:29:13,590
I think I can say they exclusively
happened early in life when your brain is

491
00:29:13,591 --> 00:29:17,910
developing. And if you don't receive
sensory inputs during that period,

492
00:29:17,911 --> 00:29:20,250
you will never really
learn how to interpret it.

493
00:29:20,251 --> 00:29:22,680
So if you don't get auditory
information when you're very young,

494
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:26,520
you just don't learn how to hear. You
don't learn how to interpret speech. Um,

495
00:29:26,730 --> 00:29:31,320
and so they found that the earlier you
can put it in the device in to a deaf

496
00:29:31,321 --> 00:29:31,801
individual,

497
00:29:31,801 --> 00:29:36,801
the more they're going to be able to
understand hearing an auditory signals

498
00:29:37,021 --> 00:29:40,140
later in life. It's
extremely controversial. Why?

499
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,700
Okay,
sorry.

500
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:48,280
Because consent is an issue, right?
And infant isn't capable of consenting.

501
00:29:49,410 --> 00:29:54,100
Um, this is, you know, it's actually
a very minimally invasive surgery.

502
00:29:54,101 --> 00:29:54,761
Eye Surgeries go,

503
00:29:54,761 --> 00:29:58,630
but it is a surgery and a lot of
people consider it an elective surgery.

504
00:29:58,780 --> 00:30:02,260
A lot of members of the deaf community
consider deafness not really to be a

505
00:30:02,261 --> 00:30:05,720
disability and not really to be
a problem that needs solving. Um,

506
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:09,160
and I don't really have any great
insights or solutions on this.

507
00:30:09,161 --> 00:30:12,720
I just pointing out this is in
fact a problem that comes up, um,

508
00:30:13,090 --> 00:30:15,710
and brain computer interface land.
Um,

509
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:20,710
this next one down here we have
a less young individual, um,

510
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:23,740
with this particular implant.
Does anybody know what this is?

511
00:30:27,370 --> 00:30:31,300
Kind of. It's close. So
it is a visual implant.

512
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:35,320
A retinal implant. Yeah.
So this is the artist two,

513
00:30:35,770 --> 00:30:39,070
which is developed by second sight.
It has recently,

514
00:30:39,130 --> 00:30:41,890
I think 2013 received FDA approval.

515
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:45,250
So there are people at
various places in the country,

516
00:30:45,251 --> 00:30:48,610
very centers in the country that are
actually implanting these retinal implants

517
00:30:48,790 --> 00:30:53,310
for people that have, um, total vision
loss. So they're completely blind. Um,

518
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:58,210
and the rental implant is like you
might guess, implanted on the retina.

519
00:30:58,510 --> 00:31:00,850
Retinal Anatomy has sort of
a strange naming convention.

520
00:31:00,851 --> 00:31:04,390
So front and back might not mean exactly
what they seem like they should mean,

521
00:31:04,391 --> 00:31:08,920
but in any case it's implanted.
Um, on the surface of your retina,

522
00:31:08,921 --> 00:31:12,580
that sort of touches all that gooey
eyeball jelly stuff in the middle.

523
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:15,030
That's where the implant is.
Um,

524
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:18,790
there's a camera right in the middle
of these glasses and the camera is

525
00:31:18,791 --> 00:31:19,150
recording.

526
00:31:19,150 --> 00:31:24,150
The visual scene is doing
a lot of processing on that
information to get it to,

527
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:28,980
uh, sort of, uh, I can't remember how
many contacts they have, but it's,

528
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,230
it's on the order of like
a hundred electrodes are on
the surface of the retina

529
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:35,620
and then it stimulates the retina,
the,

530
00:31:35,710 --> 00:31:40,150
the remaining cells on the retina
with that digital information.

531
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:45,120
Um, there's a couple of conditions
where this is really good. Uh,

532
00:31:45,150 --> 00:31:48,940
so if you have a what's called
age related macular degeneration,

533
00:31:49,150 --> 00:31:52,720
then your photo receptors cells
degenerate over time on the retina.

534
00:31:53,170 --> 00:31:55,540
That's one condition where
this is an appropriate device.

535
00:31:55,541 --> 00:31:58,600
The other one would be retina and tie,
retinitis Pigmentosa,

536
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:03,550
which is actually a heritable condition
where people also progressively lose

537
00:32:03,551 --> 00:32:06,650
their photoreceptors. But in
both of those conditions, um,

538
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:10,060
the rest of the cells in the
retina tend to be preserved.

539
00:32:10,270 --> 00:32:12,910
So it's useful to have a retinal implant.

540
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:15,340
It's not useful to have a retinal implant.

541
00:32:15,341 --> 00:32:19,200
It's her blind because you don't
have eyes, right? If you lose an eye,

542
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:21,820
retinal implant isn't going to
do really all that much good.

543
00:32:22,330 --> 00:32:25,780
There are kinds of other visual implants
that people are developing and you can

544
00:32:25,781 --> 00:32:26,980
have a cortical implant.

545
00:32:27,010 --> 00:32:30,010
There are some groups that are
working on a syllabic implants.

546
00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:34,540
This is kind of a different idea.
Um, does anybody know what this is?

547
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:42,820
Somebody said something, but I didn't
hear what it was. All right, cool.

548
00:32:42,850 --> 00:32:47,630
Underscore substitution or vision.
Exactly. That's totally what it is.

549
00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:53,510
This is what we call a tactile visual
sensory substitution device, right?

550
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:57,530
So the idea is you take visual
information, he's wearing
the really cool glasses,

551
00:32:57,531 --> 00:32:59,120
again,
with the camera on the front,

552
00:32:59,330 --> 00:33:03,890
taking that visual information and
turning it into a tactal input.

553
00:33:04,010 --> 00:33:07,670
So tactal input is what I'm holding
in my hand so everybody can sort of

554
00:33:09,230 --> 00:33:12,140
touch your sense of touch.
Um, and in this case,

555
00:33:12,141 --> 00:33:15,650
they're not putting it on
the guy's fingertips because
you use your fingers for

556
00:33:15,651 --> 00:33:17,600
a lot of stuff,
especially if you're blind.

557
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:20,720
They're putting it in this cool headband.
Right on his forehead.

558
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:22,950
I've also seen them on the tongue.
Um,

559
00:33:22,970 --> 00:33:26,000
you can also put them on
the back or the neck. Um,

560
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:30,020
you have a different distribution of
sensory receptors across the surface of

561
00:33:30,021 --> 00:33:30,410
your body.

562
00:33:30,410 --> 00:33:33,440
So there are some places where you're
going to get better acuity from this than

563
00:33:33,441 --> 00:33:34,370
others.
Um,

564
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:38,810
but this is also a kind of
brain computer interface,

565
00:33:39,670 --> 00:33:43,530
a much less invasive kind of
brain computer interface. Um,

566
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:48,840
so moving on to motor kinds of brain
computer interfaces. This guy up here, um,

567
00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:52,540
has a very severe spinal cord injury.
Um,

568
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:54,710
you can see he's actually on a respirator,

569
00:33:54,770 --> 00:33:59,330
so he has a complete transection of
his spinal cord, um, very high. Um,

570
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:02,750
and uh, so when I give this talk
to students, I usually say, well,

571
00:34:02,751 --> 00:34:05,540
he was in a knife fight and the first
thing we should learn from this is that

572
00:34:05,541 --> 00:34:08,640
nobody should get in a
knife fight. Right? Um,

573
00:34:08,870 --> 00:34:11,620
and that's still good advice
even if you're not a kid. Um,

574
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:16,850
so this thing that looks like a plug
that's going into his brain is in fact a

575
00:34:16,851 --> 00:34:18,800
plug that's going right into his brain.
Okay.

576
00:34:18,801 --> 00:34:23,360
So the scientists at Brown University
as part of this research venture called

577
00:34:23,361 --> 00:34:28,100
braingate have implanted electrodes
into the part of his brain that used to

578
00:34:28,101 --> 00:34:30,560
control movement of his arm and his hand.
Um,

579
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:34,190
and then when they record
the activity of those cells,

580
00:34:34,191 --> 00:34:38,000
when he's thinking about or trying
to move his arm or his hand,

581
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:43,100
they turn that into a signal which
controls a computer cursor on a screen.

582
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:48,500
And this was really one of the first
demonstrations of a human brain computer

583
00:34:48,501 --> 00:34:49,280
interface.

584
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:52,910
And this group has continued to develop
the technology and then now have people

585
00:34:52,911 --> 00:34:57,860
moving really fancy robotic
arms exclusively with brand
power and it's all very

586
00:34:57,861 --> 00:35:02,600
scifi and very cool. Um, so this is,

587
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:07,210
uh, another kind of motor based
brain computer interface. So, uh,

588
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:11,750
this person obviously has
had an amputation as a result
of a motorcycle accident.

589
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:14,930
So the lesson there is everyone would
be very careful when you're riding a

590
00:35:14,931 --> 00:35:16,880
motorcycle. All right. Um,

591
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:21,770
and she's very lucky because she went to
the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago

592
00:35:21,771 --> 00:35:26,240
and they tried out this new technique
where they took the severed nerve stump

593
00:35:26,450 --> 00:35:30,320
that was leftover after the amputation
and they pulled out the motor part of the

594
00:35:30,321 --> 00:35:35,060
nerve. Right? So you have, um, the,
the nerves that are going down or,

595
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:35,451
yeah,

596
00:35:35,451 --> 00:35:38,610
the neurons that are the axons of the
neurons that are going down to innovate

597
00:35:38,611 --> 00:35:39,444
the muscles.

598
00:35:39,450 --> 00:35:42,300
And then you also have the sensory
receptors that are coming back to give

599
00:35:42,301 --> 00:35:43,200
information to your brain.

600
00:35:43,201 --> 00:35:46,830
So they took out the motor part of that
and they actually implanted it in the

601
00:35:46,831 --> 00:35:49,100
pectoral muscle right here.
Um,

602
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:54,360
and then after those nerve roots sort
of grew back and innovator the pectoral

603
00:35:54,361 --> 00:35:57,600
muscle, when she thought about
moving her arm or her hand,

604
00:35:57,630 --> 00:36:00,830
it actually cause contraction
of that muscle. Um,

605
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:04,210
and then they can put electrodes on the
surface of that muscle delay detecting

606
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:08,400
the electrical activity of the muscle
and then use that to control this really

607
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:10,470
tremendously complicated robotic arm.

608
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:14,520
So now when she thinks about moving her
hand, the robotic hand actually moves,

609
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:15,810
which is super cool.

610
00:36:16,110 --> 00:36:20,880
And then also got sort of a bonus with
this and that the sensory nerves also

611
00:36:20,881 --> 00:36:24,780
grew back and innovative that
pectoral muscle. So now, um,

612
00:36:24,870 --> 00:36:28,740
when you press on different parts of that
muscle and the skin overlay now muscle,

613
00:36:28,830 --> 00:36:33,660
it actually feels like somebody is
pressing on her fingertips, right?

614
00:36:33,661 --> 00:36:37,230
So then they can instrument the arm
that can put pressure detectors on the

615
00:36:37,231 --> 00:36:39,900
fingertips and she can
actually get sensory feedback.

616
00:36:39,901 --> 00:36:43,730
So we actually have a closed loop brain
computer interface and that's nice.

617
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:49,350
Um, down here is another kind of
motor based brain computer interface.

618
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:55,460
So this is a for people that have high
but not very high level spinal cord

619
00:36:55,711 --> 00:36:59,160
injury. So it's for people that have
a c six or c seven level injury.

620
00:36:59,370 --> 00:37:02,900
It comes out of the Cleveland
Clinic in Cleveland. Um,

621
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:05,340
and it's actually called the free hand.

622
00:37:05,610 --> 00:37:09,510
And the idea behind this is that they
implant electrodes right into the muscle

623
00:37:09,511 --> 00:37:09,961
bodies.

624
00:37:09,961 --> 00:37:13,050
They have seven electrodes
that get implanted into the
muscle bodies in the arm.

625
00:37:13,410 --> 00:37:16,260
People that have that level of injury,
that c six c seven,

626
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:19,470
they have movement and their shoulder
and they can usually extend their elbow,

627
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:23,040
but they can't grasp or on
grasp their hand. Right?

628
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:27,210
So what they can do is stimulate those
muscles. When you stimulate the muscles,

629
00:37:27,211 --> 00:37:31,410
they can trapped. Um, and if you
do it in the right order, you want,

630
00:37:31,470 --> 00:37:33,450
you get on the other end are functional,
isn't it?

631
00:37:33,510 --> 00:37:38,310
So it's called functional
electrical stimulation. Um,
so what they're able to do,

632
00:37:38,311 --> 00:37:42,270
even with seven electrodes,
it's not nearly as many electrodes,

633
00:37:42,271 --> 00:37:45,090
is you have muscles in your arm and you
have about 30 muscles controlling your

634
00:37:45,091 --> 00:37:48,240
arm.
So seven is just a small subset of that.

635
00:37:48,241 --> 00:37:50,940
They're able to give people a
few different kinds of grass.

636
00:37:51,150 --> 00:37:53,220
And even with those few
different kinds of grass,

637
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:58,280
people are able now to really
enhance their independence,

638
00:37:58,771 --> 00:38:00,960
right? So they can brush their
teeth where before they couldn't,

639
00:38:00,990 --> 00:38:02,130
they can feed themselves,

640
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:07,190
they can do all kinds of ivy if even seen
pictures of people playing tennis with

641
00:38:08,011 --> 00:38:11,340
the [inaudible] system where they
couldn't have done that before. Um,

642
00:38:11,341 --> 00:38:14,940
so unfortunately this device
is no longer available.

643
00:38:15,030 --> 00:38:18,480
And one of the reasons for that is because
it's only useful for people that have

644
00:38:18,481 --> 00:38:22,440
this very specific level of injury.
And why would that be the case?

645
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:31,613
Yeah.

646
00:38:35,030 --> 00:38:39,870
[inaudible]
um,

647
00:38:39,970 --> 00:38:43,420
that's a good point to think about
sort of spasticity issues. Um,

648
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:48,360
and that's specificity is always an issue
when you have a spinal cord injury. Um,

649
00:38:48,361 --> 00:38:52,090
and it's also very unpredictable,
but that's actually not the case.

650
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:53,950
That's not the,
it's not the driving factor here.

651
00:38:58,730 --> 00:39:02,870
Right? So the economics are the
reason why it's not broadly,

652
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:04,880
you know,
commercializable.

653
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:08,450
But the reason it's only really useful
to people that have this c six c seven

654
00:39:08,451 --> 00:39:11,840
level injury is because these people
can move their shoulder and shoulder

655
00:39:11,841 --> 00:39:15,620
movement is important because there
was no brain part of this device.

656
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:18,400
You have to be able to communicate
with this device in some way. Right.

657
00:39:18,770 --> 00:39:20,030
And so the way that they did it,

658
00:39:20,090 --> 00:39:24,020
as they put a joystick on the wheelchair
with the contralateral soldier shoulder

659
00:39:24,021 --> 00:39:27,230
and they're able to move the joystick
by moving their shoulder around.

660
00:39:28,010 --> 00:39:28,821
So recently,

661
00:39:28,821 --> 00:39:33,680
there have been some people that have
tried to sort of connect this with this to

662
00:39:33,681 --> 00:39:38,681
connect to the whole brain control
interface part with the muscle control.

663
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:42,870
There's a group at all Ohio state that
did it. A proof of concept does this, um,

664
00:39:43,490 --> 00:39:46,330
last year.
Um,

665
00:39:46,540 --> 00:39:49,910
so that's sort of the state of the
art and brain computer interfaces.

666
00:39:49,911 --> 00:39:52,670
And I think Eric wants to take
you a different direction.

667
00:39:52,770 --> 00:39:54,300
Yeah. Just, just the opposite direction.

668
00:39:54,301 --> 00:39:56,130
At least brought you all
the way to the future.

669
00:39:56,220 --> 00:39:59,730
I'm bringing you all the way back to
the past way in the past where for many

670
00:39:59,731 --> 00:40:04,731
years people have looked up to the moon
and have assign blame to the moon for

671
00:40:06,330 --> 00:40:09,720
many different reasons. So we
get the word lunacy, right?

672
00:40:09,721 --> 00:40:13,740
The root word lunacy comes from
the word Luna meaning moon. Right?

673
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:19,040
And for many years people have tried to
assign blame to the moon for things like

674
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:24,570
traffic accidents, uh, domestic
violence calls, uh, poisoning, suicides,

675
00:40:24,571 --> 00:40:25,620
murders,
violence.

676
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:30,360
And these data are relatively
easy to extract, right?

677
00:40:30,390 --> 00:40:31,740
You go to the police blotter,

678
00:40:31,890 --> 00:40:36,330
you go to the Almanac and you can see
what phase of the moon and match it up to

679
00:40:36,331 --> 00:40:40,890
a particular day and count how many
accidents or traffic accidents or,

680
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:41,790
or what.

681
00:40:41,790 --> 00:40:45,300
And there've been a close to a hundred
different studies looking at a lot of

682
00:40:45,301 --> 00:40:46,230
these different behaviors.

683
00:40:46,410 --> 00:40:50,730
And there's no evidence to suggest that
the phase of the moon affects behavior

684
00:40:50,731 --> 00:40:55,170
in any way. Now that won't dissuade many
people. And in fact, uh, at my house,

685
00:40:55,171 --> 00:40:59,820
we had someone over at the house, I
won't mention her name, uh, but she, uh,

686
00:40:59,821 --> 00:41:04,570
is in law enforcement and you know,
at my house somehow,

687
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:07,230
I don't know how we end up
talking about the brain.

688
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:11,220
Don't ask me how that
happens. But, uh, and we, the,

689
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:15,540
the full moon came up and she said,
Oh, uh, you know, uh, you know,

690
00:41:15,541 --> 00:41:17,030
when I'm out on patrol,
uh,

691
00:41:17,090 --> 00:41:20,940
I pulled more people out of the ditch
and I go to more domestic violence cases

692
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:23,460
when that full moon is
out. And I said, well,

693
00:41:23,461 --> 00:41:27,060
don't do things happen at other times
of the month. And she said, well, yeah,

694
00:41:27,061 --> 00:41:30,600
it happens, but I just don't
notice it. And I said, exactly.

695
00:41:30,990 --> 00:41:32,310
Because if you look at the literature,

696
00:41:32,311 --> 00:41:36,710
you'll find that almost no correlation
between the phase of the moon and any of

697
00:41:36,711 --> 00:41:40,520
these unusual abnormal
behaviors, uh, and really, uh,

698
00:41:40,521 --> 00:41:43,940
the physics of it don't make sense to you
do that. The gravitational pull of the,

699
00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:48,620
uh, on the earth just don't match
the, uh, in, in the human body.

700
00:41:48,621 --> 00:41:50,750
So there's really no reason for it.

701
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:55,160
But the people that have the strongest
beliefs that the moon does affect

702
00:41:55,161 --> 00:41:59,510
behavior are people in law
enforcement and medical personnel.

703
00:42:00,410 --> 00:42:05,410
And my hypothesis is that these
professions that are high stress jobs,

704
00:42:05,930 --> 00:42:10,130
that they see bad things happen,
they seem horrific accidents.

705
00:42:10,340 --> 00:42:15,260
And if they can assign blame
to something like the moon,

706
00:42:15,350 --> 00:42:18,320
then it relieves stress from
him. Now I, that's my hypothesis.

707
00:42:18,321 --> 00:42:20,510
Whether it's true or not,
I don't know. But again,

708
00:42:20,511 --> 00:42:23,120
if you look at the types of professions,

709
00:42:23,121 --> 00:42:26,630
and there have been studies about who
holds the strongest beliefs at are those

710
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:29,330
and very high stress positions.
Yeah.

711
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:40,040
Yeah. So that's, that's one
hypothesis is why, why did,

712
00:42:40,070 --> 00:42:42,560
why did it originally come up?
And some people said, well,

713
00:42:42,561 --> 00:42:46,100
maybe in the old days before
there is artificial light, uh,

714
00:42:46,130 --> 00:42:51,060
the artificial light provided a
thieves and robbers and, uh, more, uh,

715
00:42:51,260 --> 00:42:55,220
light to do their nefarious actions. And
then the police could also see them. Uh,

716
00:42:55,221 --> 00:42:58,430
and so that would cause,
so that's one hypothesis about why,

717
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:01,790
but why that might be
why the myth started,

718
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,210
but why it is skill exists
when we have artificial life,

719
00:43:05,270 --> 00:43:09,890
it doesn't really make sense. Um,
so why that, why that's the case?

720
00:43:10,290 --> 00:43:14,090
Uh, we don't really know
for sure. Um, but, uh,

721
00:43:14,091 --> 00:43:17,610
that's the end of our formal presentation.
I just want to again, thank David and,

722
00:43:17,611 --> 00:43:19,540
and Google for having
us, uh, our publisher,

723
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:22,740
Norton and company and also the center
for sensory motor neural engineer who

724
00:43:22,741 --> 00:43:27,200
both Lisa and I work. So, uh,
we have time for some questions.

725
00:43:27,201 --> 00:43:30,260
Uh, you know, now it's kind of
your time, uh, that you know,

726
00:43:30,261 --> 00:43:32,840
there's something about the brand and
you didn't know if it was true or not.

727
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:37,310
We might have an answer for you, uh,
or something that, yeah, we won't,

728
00:43:37,311 --> 00:43:41,120
we won't make one out. Um, but, um,

729
00:43:41,150 --> 00:43:43,880
if there's a question that
you have now as a time to ask,

730
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:48,850
so there's a lot of information online
about the pineal gland and specifically

731
00:43:48,851 --> 00:43:53,740
how fluoride supposedly affects it
in some magical, mysterious way.

732
00:43:53,770 --> 00:43:56,050
Are there,
is there any merit to these claims?

733
00:43:56,170 --> 00:43:58,030
What is the peanut Atlanta
and how does it work?

734
00:43:58,390 --> 00:44:00,580
Yeah, so the pineal Glen is a, is a,

735
00:44:00,740 --> 00:44:04,140
is a gland pineal comes from
the word pine nut or pine.

736
00:44:04,150 --> 00:44:08,350
This is a little pine cone shaped thing
right in the center of the brain. Uh,

737
00:44:08,380 --> 00:44:12,160
the long history of it,
uh, is, uh, Dukart, uh,

738
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:15,250
originally thought that that was the seat
of the soul maybe cause it was in the

739
00:44:15,251 --> 00:44:19,990
center of the brain. It releases a lot
of Serotonin. It might have some, uh,

740
00:44:20,340 --> 00:44:24,820
uh, uh, function in circadian
rhythms and things like that,

741
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:29,830
but I haven't heard anything
about fluoride or its effect.

742
00:44:29,860 --> 00:44:34,620
I haven't seen any on that. Um, so the
function of it, it's, it's a, it's a,

743
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:37,710
not like a gland.
Um,

744
00:44:37,770 --> 00:44:40,860
might have to do with some circadian
rhythms and things like that,

745
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:44,030
but I haven't heard anything specifically
about flora as a neuroscientist.

746
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:48,570
I mean the, the field of
neuroscience is so huge that, uh,

747
00:44:48,950 --> 00:44:53,220
you know, I, I kind of know my area,
but what's happening in other areas,

748
00:44:53,221 --> 00:44:56,670
it's very difficult with thousands and
thousands of papers being generated every

749
00:44:56,670 --> 00:44:58,400
year. And in fact, you know,
for the book, I have haven't,

750
00:44:58,700 --> 00:45:01,290
I know I wrote some of the quiet,
the answers to the questions,

751
00:45:01,410 --> 00:45:05,310
but at least brings a whole area
of expertise that I don't have a,

752
00:45:05,311 --> 00:45:08,610
and that's kind of like, you
know, a question like that is,

753
00:45:08,611 --> 00:45:11,310
it's very hard to follow the
most recent literature. Um,

754
00:45:11,430 --> 00:45:12,750
but I haven't heard anything about it yet.

755
00:45:15,250 --> 00:45:16,520
So it's a,

756
00:45:16,570 --> 00:45:20,890
we are now able to decode a electrical
information from the brain for things

757
00:45:20,891 --> 00:45:25,280
that like related to, uh, um, like our,

758
00:45:25,390 --> 00:45:28,750
our modem functions and, and sensory, uh,

759
00:45:28,780 --> 00:45:32,680
are we close to actually be able to do
the same of decoding brain electrical

760
00:45:32,681 --> 00:45:37,450
information, uh, with the goats to higher
level, uh, brain functions like, you know,

761
00:45:37,451 --> 00:45:42,451
memory and perhaps coaches thinking again
and so forth every even close to that

762
00:45:42,911 --> 00:45:43,990
have you up to music about it.

763
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:49,040
Um, so I think it's, it's kind of
an interesting question because,

764
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:55,280
so there's a lot of different kinds
of higher level thinking, right?

765
00:45:55,281 --> 00:46:00,281
So memory is a little bit different then
like higher order cognitive function

766
00:46:00,950 --> 00:46:05,090
because there's a very specific part of
the brain that we know is very involved

767
00:46:05,091 --> 00:46:09,050
in memory formation and people have been
recording activity from the hippocampus.

768
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:12,770
If I'm that Perry Hipaa Campbell areas
for a really long period of time and can

769
00:46:12,771 --> 00:46:17,750
record a lot of how those memory
traces are laid down and stored.

770
00:46:17,890 --> 00:46:18,120
Um,

771
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:23,120
and in some cases they say that they
can tell exactly what memories are being

772
00:46:23,511 --> 00:46:24,770
recalled at any given time.

773
00:46:25,070 --> 00:46:29,810
So I think in that case we're a lot closer
than what we would be in some of the

774
00:46:29,811 --> 00:46:31,190
other higher order thinking.

775
00:46:31,370 --> 00:46:33,710
When you're talking about
higher cognitive processes,

776
00:46:33,711 --> 00:46:37,880
you're usually talking about
frontal areas. Um, and when
I was in graduate school,

777
00:46:37,881 --> 00:46:40,280
we called it the prefrontal
Cortex, right? Like there's,

778
00:46:40,310 --> 00:46:42,260
there's so much stuff going on in there,

779
00:46:42,410 --> 00:46:46,880
there's so much association that I think
it's really hard to piece apart any

780
00:46:46,881 --> 00:46:48,590
individual thing.
Um,

781
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:53,300
and so when you get down to this room
more basic functions like motor or

782
00:46:53,301 --> 00:46:53,811
sensory,

783
00:46:53,811 --> 00:46:57,710
I think there's a much higher probability
that we'll be able to decode those

784
00:46:57,711 --> 00:47:02,000
functions specifically.
Um, which is, but you know,

785
00:47:02,001 --> 00:47:04,960
but there are certain things you can
tell like, so for example, there's a,

786
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,860
what we call the error related negativity,

787
00:47:06,861 --> 00:47:10,730
which you can record from EEG when
somebody has made a mistake and they know

788
00:47:10,731 --> 00:47:14,230
that they've made a mistake in
a task, you can record that. Um,

789
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:18,350
when somebody sees something that's
surprising and also meaningful to them,

790
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:21,770
there's an EEG signature to that
that people can record as well.

791
00:47:21,890 --> 00:47:24,320
So there are certain things
that you can pick out,

792
00:47:24,321 --> 00:47:28,490
but in terms of just decoding somebody's
thoughts or a stream of consciousness I

793
00:47:28,491 --> 00:47:30,760
think were really long way from that.

794
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:36,960
I have a question about one of the
of this brain computer interfaces.

795
00:47:37,290 --> 00:47:40,660
There was a guy who this other stuff
can to get spray and he was like

796
00:47:40,810 --> 00:47:43,650
[inaudible] a malls.
Like of course our halls.

797
00:47:44,370 --> 00:47:49,280
So how does it or doesn't like a
passion like four I looked throats good

798
00:47:49,340 --> 00:47:54,270
songwriting, rob them area of the brain
or find like particular specific area.

799
00:47:54,350 --> 00:47:55,183
And so

800
00:47:56,610 --> 00:48:01,070
dusk you have to train that Shelia
speak of all cell phones things or

801
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:05,060
right. So I'm in this case, they're
usually implanting thinking Utah, right,

802
00:48:05,110 --> 00:48:09,790
which was developed in Utah. Um, and it
has about a hundred electrodes on it.

803
00:48:10,090 --> 00:48:10,480
Um,

804
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:14,530
and they're all sort of shaft
style electrodes and you
plant them all within one

805
00:48:14,531 --> 00:48:16,360
very small area of the brain.

806
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:20,340
And in this case they really want to
target the part of the brain that used to

807
00:48:20,350 --> 00:48:22,600
control and movement of
the hand or the harm.

808
00:48:22,630 --> 00:48:27,190
Because the idea is that that will be the
most natural way to control the device.

809
00:48:27,340 --> 00:48:31,480
So usually they would put the person in
an Fmri scanner and then they would have

810
00:48:31,481 --> 00:48:33,370
the person to think about
moving their hand or arm.

811
00:48:33,371 --> 00:48:37,300
And that gives them a way to localize
the part of the brain that would be

812
00:48:37,301 --> 00:48:40,210
involved with that.
And then in when they go into surgery,

813
00:48:40,211 --> 00:48:42,310
they try and implant that right there.
Um,

814
00:48:42,610 --> 00:48:47,430
but there is a fair bit of
training involved. Um, and it,

815
00:48:47,830 --> 00:48:49,210
it actually gets very complicated.

816
00:48:49,211 --> 00:48:53,050
You may have to train the device every
day because the neurons surrounding the

817
00:48:53,051 --> 00:48:56,990
implant might also die or become
inaccessible for other reasons. Um,

818
00:48:57,250 --> 00:49:00,460
so it's not as if you put the implant
in and then you can magically just move

819
00:49:00,461 --> 00:49:01,880
your arm the way that you used to.

820
00:49:01,890 --> 00:49:04,060
Or you can move a computer
cursor without effort.

821
00:49:04,061 --> 00:49:05,830
You do have to train on the device.

822
00:49:06,860 --> 00:49:09,730
So normally we have the ability to ask,

823
00:49:09,990 --> 00:49:12,800
moving our arm without
actually moving at this.

824
00:49:12,860 --> 00:49:16,190
Is this person using
the sooner or interface?

825
00:49:16,330 --> 00:49:18,900
He just mashes moving.

826
00:49:18,901 --> 00:49:23,790
Disarm is the just that aren't
really wants it to whatnot. Um,

827
00:49:24,350 --> 00:49:29,060
that's a good question. Um, so
when we imagine moving our arms,

828
00:49:29,061 --> 00:49:32,990
it's actually the same part of our brain
is active is when we actually move our

829
00:49:32,991 --> 00:49:34,850
arms at least.

830
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:37,760
So I should say the part of the brain
that they're recording that same part of

831
00:49:37,761 --> 00:49:41,060
the brain is active whether you imagine
or whether you actually move your arm.

832
00:49:41,450 --> 00:49:45,410
So presumably then if somebody had a
brain computer interface that they were

833
00:49:45,411 --> 00:49:48,860
using every day in their life than if
they just sort of imagined using it,

834
00:49:48,861 --> 00:49:52,480
that would also trigger
activation of the arm. Um,

835
00:49:53,150 --> 00:49:58,150
maybe designers would think about that
and implement some sort of on off too.

836
00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:02,780
I mean that's the thing that people
think about it for other reasons.

837
00:50:02,781 --> 00:50:07,590
It's how can you inactivate your device
when you don't want it to be working. Um,

838
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:11,750
there's also, you know, there's just
a lot of plasticity in your brain.

839
00:50:11,780 --> 00:50:13,850
The brain has a chance
to change itself a lot.

840
00:50:13,851 --> 00:50:16,850
And I sort of would think,

841
00:50:16,970 --> 00:50:21,970
I would hypothesize that your brain
might natively be able to overcome that

842
00:50:22,250 --> 00:50:24,320
particular barrier.
Is it if you used it a lot?

843
00:50:29,300 --> 00:50:31,310
Oh, dreaming is kind of a hard one. But,

844
00:50:31,420 --> 00:50:35,180
so if you were in the phase of sleep
in rem sleep where you have these vivid

845
00:50:35,181 --> 00:50:38,570
dreams.
I kinda think so if your devices on,

846
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:40,120
okay.
I've been,

847
00:50:40,250 --> 00:50:43,810
but that's an interesting question and
it brings up additional questions that

848
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:47,470
say that either you're dreaming
and all of a sudden your arm moves,

849
00:50:47,590 --> 00:50:50,410
or if you're walking down the street
and all of a sudden you're our moves and

850
00:50:50,411 --> 00:50:51,400
say it interests someone,

851
00:50:51,430 --> 00:50:54,970
maybe someone that's in the bed with you
or you're walking down the street and

852
00:50:54,971 --> 00:50:59,350
then they had somebody that you don't
know who's responsible for that injury

853
00:50:59,351 --> 00:51:01,570
that you caused with that arm
because you were sleeping.

854
00:51:01,571 --> 00:51:04,330
It wasn't me that caused it.
It with the arm just moved by itself.

855
00:51:04,870 --> 00:51:08,170
So who's responsible?
Is it the person who's our moved?

856
00:51:08,230 --> 00:51:12,750
Is it the engineer who built the arm?
Is it the physician who installed the arm?

857
00:51:13,090 --> 00:51:16,680
Or is it the programmer who
programmed that arm or the,

858
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:20,990
or decoded that signal and then sent that
signal out. Who's responsible for it?

859
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:26,520
So these are questions that in this
entire field that perhaps engineers and

860
00:51:26,921 --> 00:51:29,680
neuroscientists are perhaps
not equipped to answer.

861
00:51:29,890 --> 00:51:33,010
And at the center for sensory
motor neural engine where we work,

862
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:38,120
we are actually collaborating with
philosophers and newer ethicists and the

863
00:51:38,890 --> 00:51:40,960
Department of Philosophy at the University
of Washington to ask some of these

864
00:51:40,961 --> 00:51:45,220
questions because scientists
and engineers, sometimes
we can do these things,

865
00:51:45,490 --> 00:51:47,510
but how should we do these things?
And,

866
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:51,700
and should we do these things are
questions that we don't always ask before

867
00:51:51,701 --> 00:51:52,241
they're developed.

868
00:51:52,241 --> 00:51:55,270
And so we're trying to get some of
these questions at least brought up and

869
00:51:55,271 --> 00:51:58,630
discussed not only within our own
community but with the end users.

870
00:51:58,780 --> 00:52:01,720
Those people that will be the
recipients of these devices,

871
00:52:01,810 --> 00:52:05,350
they should have some say in what they're
going to do and what they can do and

872
00:52:05,351 --> 00:52:10,160
what they can't do and what they look
like. Um, so these are, these are, uh,

873
00:52:10,450 --> 00:52:13,780
you know, the, the, the
simple, not, not such a simple,

874
00:52:13,781 --> 00:52:18,100
but the obvious questions lead to
many, many other questions, which are,

875
00:52:18,150 --> 00:52:19,900
or deeper on so many different levels.

876
00:52:20,030 --> 00:52:24,020
So you mentioned giving this talk to
Buddhists and I believe there was an

877
00:52:24,021 --> 00:52:27,080
interesting outcome of the
Dalai Lama undergoing an MRI.

878
00:52:27,210 --> 00:52:30,200
Are there any avenues of research
along those lines around self,

879
00:52:30,201 --> 00:52:31,400
brain modulation,
etc?

880
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:36,450
Yeah, I, I don't know of the Dye
Lama himself, uh, undergoing an MRI,

881
00:52:36,451 --> 00:52:39,180
but there have been,
uh,

882
00:52:39,210 --> 00:52:43,050
there is research going on with Tibetan
Buddhist monks who have come to the

883
00:52:43,051 --> 00:52:44,020
states,
uh,

884
00:52:44,140 --> 00:52:48,720
and have been meditated in the scanners
and they're trying to correlate some of

885
00:52:48,721 --> 00:52:52,650
the changes that go on in the
brain during meditation. Um,

886
00:52:53,190 --> 00:52:57,500
to be honest, I don't know
if there's been a lot of, uh,

887
00:52:57,750 --> 00:53:02,750
data that can be extracted to suggest
how we can become compassionate like they

888
00:53:02,971 --> 00:53:06,780
are from, from the, from the literature.
Uh, but that's ongoing research.

889
00:53:06,870 --> 00:53:10,300
And so what is the neural
basis of meditation, uh,

890
00:53:10,530 --> 00:53:15,180
that might give rise to the neural
correlate of consciousness itself?

891
00:53:15,750 --> 00:53:17,570
Uh, and you know, as scientists,

892
00:53:17,580 --> 00:53:21,060
we've always tried to externalize
everything. You know, we,

893
00:53:21,061 --> 00:53:24,960
we measure it in other people,
but consciousness and compassion,

894
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:28,470
something that comes from within.
And so maybe it's something that,

895
00:53:28,530 --> 00:53:33,300
that we need to look within ourselves and
steady ourselves as opposed to studies

896
00:53:33,330 --> 00:53:37,380
others to maybe get to some of
those questions. So, um, that,

897
00:53:37,381 --> 00:53:40,230
that research is ongoing.
It's a relatively, very new,

898
00:53:40,530 --> 00:53:45,150
a line of research combining a
meditation and modern neuroscience.

899
00:53:45,330 --> 00:53:48,110
And I think the data's
still waiting to come on.

900
00:53:48,150 --> 00:53:51,510
Thank you very much for coming and
answering a lot of questions at all.

901
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:57,390
[inaudible].
