1
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:08,300
I'd like to start by
introducing our speaker today.

2
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:12,890
So Dr a preamp not to Raja will
be telling us about things.

3
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:14,270
So tell you a little bit about her.

4
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:19,250
She grew up in the Deli area to
academic parents. She attended MIT.

5
00:00:19,251 --> 00:00:22,910
You are, she was awarded degrees in
physics and the mathematics after that.

6
00:00:22,911 --> 00:00:26,600
If you did her graduate work in
theoretical astrophysics at Cambridge,

7
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:29,530
and she's currently professor of
astronomy and physics it, yeah,

8
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:32,420
in a professional life you've
been a word of tons of awards.

9
00:00:32,421 --> 00:00:34,640
You've looked them up on the
Wikipedia page or on her page.

10
00:00:34,641 --> 00:00:36,410
I'm not going to go over
all of them right now,

11
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:38,900
and she's given a Ted talk
on the same kind of thing.

12
00:00:38,901 --> 00:00:40,250
She's here to talk about today.

13
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:43,490
So I think you'll agree with me that
she's seriously knows her stuff.

14
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:47,510
When you were young, maybe like
me, you looked up at the stars,

15
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:50,930
kind of wondered what was out there free.
The wonder that too.

16
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:54,200
And she's gone a lot further to actually
find out what's out there and map it

17
00:00:54,201 --> 00:00:57,380
for us. Like Bilbo Baggins. I love maps.

18
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:01,970
I love for math puts mine to shame and
she's worked hard to bring us some good

19
00:01:01,971 --> 00:01:05,300
maps of the cosmos. Slept. Please
give a warm welcome to Priya

20
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:10,340
[inaudible].

21
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:17,490
I wanted to start out by reading out
a quote that inspired me to write this

22
00:01:22,451 --> 00:01:26,980
book. I had always been, um,
since I was an undergraduate,

23
00:01:26,981 --> 00:01:30,760
I was always interested in the history
of ideas and in history and philosophy of

24
00:01:30,761 --> 00:01:35,761
science and in particular the process
of why is it that some ideas take a very

25
00:01:37,451 --> 00:01:42,170
long time to be accepted radical ideas
and why is it that some of them are the

26
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:46,290
accepted very, very rapidly. And so what
is the difference and why and you're not.

27
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:49,990
And I came face to face,
um, with this question,

28
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:53,770
I actually come face to face with it
almost every day as a working scientist

29
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:57,730
because, you know, there are papers that
I write, um, that I think, you know,

30
00:01:57,731 --> 00:02:00,010
it's a cute idea.
It's um,

31
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:02,980
a very nice idea and it sort
of syncs without a trace.

32
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:08,020
And then I write a paper that I think,
um, he's okay. And Do, you know,

33
00:02:08,021 --> 00:02:11,980
it's cited a hundred times,
200 times growing rapidly as we,

34
00:02:11,981 --> 00:02:15,100
it's always intrigued me
what that process is, right?

35
00:02:15,101 --> 00:02:17,560
I mean intellectually what the process is.

36
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:23,260
And so that motivated me to actually
pursue graduate study in the history and

37
00:02:23,261 --> 00:02:27,160
philosophy of sign, which I abandoned
because I loved science are so much more.

38
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:28,023
Um,

39
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:33,600
and so let me read this quote from
Karl Popper and the logic of scientific

40
00:02:34,361 --> 00:02:39,361
discovery that will give you a preview
of what my particular take is on mapping

41
00:02:41,381 --> 00:02:42,214
ideas.

42
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:46,630
So on bold ideas on justified
anticipations and speculative thought.

43
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:49,180
Our only means for interpreting nature.

44
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:53,920
Those among us who are unwilling to
expose their ideas to the hazard of

45
00:02:53,921 --> 00:02:57,430
reputation do not take part
in the scientific game.

46
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:02,460
So it's ballpark in the logic of
scientific discovery. And so, um,

47
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:07,390
what I want to do today is to
take you through a journey of,

48
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:12,130
of acceptance of two very
radical ideas in cosmology.

49
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:17,080
So our cosmic view has been
transformed in the last hundred years.

50
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:18,880
In the early 19 hundreds,

51
00:03:18,881 --> 00:03:22,030
we did not even know about the
existence of other galaxies.

52
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:25,690
We thought the Milky Way was it
right? Uh, in Copernicus's time,

53
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:30,780
which was probably the radical idea
that set everything in motion that came

54
00:03:31,241 --> 00:03:34,420
afterward was the displacement
of the earth and the sun.

55
00:03:34,421 --> 00:03:38,650
He moved the pivot of the solar
system from the earth to the sun.

56
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:43,870
And at Inco, panic is his time
in the 15, forties, 16 hundreds,

57
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:47,680
the entire cosmos was our solar system,
right?

58
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:52,690
And 19 hundreds, the entire
cosmos, the early 19 hundreds,

59
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,220
1910,
1912,

60
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:58,600
we only thought there was the
Milky Way and that was it. Right?

61
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:03,520
And so in the last hundred years,
not only have we made enormous progress,

62
00:04:03,521 --> 00:04:05,080
as I'll show you a,

63
00:04:05,081 --> 00:04:08,980
in terms of our understanding
of the contents of the cosmos,

64
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:13,720
the properties of the cosmos, the
timeline of the cosmos, and how, um,

65
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:15,370
structure has formed in the universe,

66
00:04:15,371 --> 00:04:20,020
how we have come to be and our place in
the sort of this grand scheme of things.

67
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:21,910
So as I mentioned,

68
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:26,470
another sort of angle that I'm interested
in is sort of the human and the

69
00:04:26,471 --> 00:04:30,010
psychological side of science.
The fact that, you know,

70
00:04:30,011 --> 00:04:34,690
science is often represented
as a sort of objective,

71
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:35,993
um,

72
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:41,250
people in the quest for some truth capital
t wearing white lab coats and they're

73
00:04:41,891 --> 00:04:45,640
teasing the secrets out of nature.
Um, and you know, it sort of really,

74
00:04:45,641 --> 00:04:50,440
and this narrative of how science
is done writes out to both,

75
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:50,891
uh,

76
00:04:50,891 --> 00:04:55,891
what I think are the rich motivations
driving passions for scientists as well as

77
00:04:57,521 --> 00:05:01,660
the backstory of the
humanness of the enterprise,

78
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:06,010
which is the rivalries,
the rush for fame, um,

79
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:10,720
the emotional investment in ideas
which you're not supposed to have as an

80
00:05:10,721 --> 00:05:13,050
objective scientist.
Um,

81
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:18,810
and part of the motivation for writing
this book was also the troubling times

82
00:05:18,941 --> 00:05:19,601
that we live in.

83
00:05:19,601 --> 00:05:24,601
We live at a time of great technological
growth of a grand convergence,

84
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:28,510
especially in cosmology
where the understanding,

85
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:29,920
the theoretical understanding,

86
00:05:29,921 --> 00:05:34,540
the maturity of our theoretical
understanding is extremely
well aligned with the

87
00:05:34,541 --> 00:05:39,490
sophistication of our instruments
that gather data and evidence and the

88
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:43,660
advancements in computing
that allow us to interpret,

89
00:05:43,661 --> 00:05:45,340
visualize the data.

90
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:50,380
So there's been a real grand convergence
in the last 10 to 20 years in cosmology

91
00:05:50,381 --> 00:05:52,030
in particular.
However,

92
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:57,320
we somehow peculiarly find ourselves
in the United States in particular in a

93
00:05:57,321 --> 00:06:02,321
climate where there's a lot of denialism
of science and rampant a disbelief and

94
00:06:02,661 --> 00:06:07,310
science and the methods of science.
And one of my goals,

95
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:10,310
and I do a lot of writing
other than scientific papers,

96
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:15,940
is to try and explain the
process of science because
I believe that a lot of the

97
00:06:17,211 --> 00:06:21,710
denial of science comes from a lack of
understanding of the process of science.

98
00:06:21,711 --> 00:06:26,510
The fact that science is contingent and
it's provisional and what we know is

99
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:30,080
best to date. And it's apt to
change. When we have better data,

100
00:06:30,081 --> 00:06:33,260
we have more data and things
don't change dramatically.

101
00:06:33,261 --> 00:06:37,190
Nothing gets appended from the
roots every other day. Um, I mean,

102
00:06:37,191 --> 00:06:41,000
those kinds of transformations
in our world view are rare.

103
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:46,420
And what really happens with every new
piece of data that comes in that adds to,

104
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:51,620
to our inventory and adds
to our understanding is the
ideas get refined more and

105
00:06:51,621 --> 00:06:54,930
more so in, um, in my book, um,

106
00:06:55,730 --> 00:07:00,290
I was obsessed with maps as a child, a
boat, celestial and terrestrial maps.

107
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:05,030
And, and I, and I tend
to see and use maps.

108
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:08,660
My own research work also
revolves around mapping.

109
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:11,150
As I'll talk about towards
the end of the talk.

110
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:16,840
And I use maps both as literal maps
mapping is as mapping is knowing,

111
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,810
um,
as well as metaphorical devices,

112
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:25,520
which basically encapsulate our worldview.
So because when we look at precise,

113
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:29,180
when we look at the 13 hundreds at 12,
12 hundreds,

114
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:33,290
we don't yet have the
reason structure of science,

115
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:37,550
but what we have are ideas that
get mediated, that distributed,

116
00:07:37,551 --> 00:07:42,200
that get contested, that are depicted as
maps. Then I'll show you some examples.

117
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:47,540
And today I want to sort of lead you
through two case studies of two concepts.

118
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:51,920
And I written about many of them in
the book, dark matter, dark energy,

119
00:07:51,921 --> 00:07:54,350
black holds the discovery
of other planets,

120
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:56,240
the discovery of the expanding universe.

121
00:07:56,241 --> 00:08:00,140
But today I'll focus on black holes and
dark matter because that's sort of what

122
00:08:00,141 --> 00:08:00,980
I work on.

123
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:04,400
So I have a site vested
interest in sharing some of
the latest results because I

124
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:09,380
think, um, most of you here would be
quite curious to know what the latest,

125
00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:13,850
what the frontier is right now. And so
I'll be doing those two case studies.

126
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:18,530
But before that I wanted to give you,
um,

127
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:24,470
set up context for how
I'm approaching these,

128
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:25,910
this idea of mapping.

129
00:08:25,911 --> 00:08:30,530
So if you look at the evidence
that we have for the oldest maps,

130
00:08:30,531 --> 00:08:33,490
the oldest depictions of the sky,
uh,

131
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:38,480
it's the [inaudible] disc and it's a
data to something like 2000 BC or so.

132
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,050
And this is a depiction of
maybe the play these cluster,

133
00:08:42,170 --> 00:08:44,150
the crescent moon and the sun.

134
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:48,890
And this is the first recorded image,
if you will,

135
00:08:48,891 --> 00:08:51,200
that we have of,
of the night sky.

136
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:56,820
But the Mesopotamians were
actually in veteran, um,

137
00:08:56,970 --> 00:09:00,390
charters of the night sky. So
you also have, for example,

138
00:09:00,391 --> 00:09:05,310
this is an example from the collection
in the Victoria and Albert Museum of the

139
00:09:05,311 --> 00:09:08,850
venous tablet is the cuneiform tablet.
And Cuneiform has now been deciphered,

140
00:09:08,851 --> 00:09:12,990
as you all know. And so what these are,
are the positions of the planet Venus.

141
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:17,550
So what is remarkable is that they
already knew the difference between a star

142
00:09:17,551 --> 00:09:19,610
and a planet. They knew, um,

143
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:23,820
that planets will wonders and they
didn't produce their own light and they

144
00:09:23,821 --> 00:09:28,800
charted them. Um, but remember they will
not actually looking for an explanation.

145
00:09:28,801 --> 00:09:30,570
They were just doing phenomenology.

146
00:09:30,571 --> 00:09:35,571
They were just charting what they
saw as a way of making sense.

147
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:39,420
And part of this was, uh, because they,

148
00:09:39,421 --> 00:09:43,920
there was no explanation for all this
violent natural phenomena. Night and day,

149
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:48,010
uh, thunderstorms,
lightning, rain, floods, um,

150
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:49,051
the,

151
00:09:49,051 --> 00:09:54,051
we're really trying to record and
connect the terrestrial to the celestial,

152
00:09:55,171 --> 00:10:00,150
so happenings on the ground with what was
happening and unfolding in the habits.

153
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:03,600
So then when we move
on to the 13 hundreds,

154
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:09,120
there's sort of a shift in the
search for some kind of explanation.

155
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,041
Finally,

156
00:10:11,041 --> 00:10:16,041
some kind of agency causality for a why
you have the phenomena that you have.

157
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:22,400
So I particularly love this map because
this is one in which the understanding

158
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:26,760
now where was that? There are these
two angels who are turning the crank.

159
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:30,690
And that's why you get night
and day. Right. And so,

160
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:35,550
and then of course you move to,

161
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:40,790
it was bright and Capitola the last
of the greatest naked I astronomers.

162
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:46,820
It's at that time that people started
looking for us explanation for celestial

163
00:10:48,151 --> 00:10:52,620
phenomena, the kind of explanation that
we are familiar with a set of principles,

164
00:10:52,621 --> 00:10:54,570
a set of laws,
uh,

165
00:10:55,110 --> 00:11:00,090
some description of the
orderly cause moss. But, um,

166
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:05,000
so this is another map, uh, you
know, prior to peer review and um,

167
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:09,690
uh, papers being refereed, you know,

168
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:14,870
con contrasting ideas and opposing
ideas were often depicted in these maps.

169
00:11:16,201 --> 00:11:19,190
And what you see here is a Riccio Yolie.

170
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:23,430
I'm weighing two different
ideas of the cosmos.

171
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:27,120
One is the familiar Ptolemaic cosmos,
which was very radical.

172
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,200
And as with a lot of radical ideas,
um,

173
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:35,190
often it's easier to accept something
that's sort of a halfway house model that

174
00:11:35,191 --> 00:11:37,800
isn't quite as far as the radical idea.

175
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:42,300
And so this is an example
where basically, um, you know,

176
00:11:42,301 --> 00:11:47,220
the earth moves around the sun, but all
the other planets move around the earth.

177
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:51,310
So the sort of halfway
house, uh, because um, uh,

178
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:55,180
corporate Nicos is a rearrangement
was a little too radical.

179
00:11:55,181 --> 00:11:57,780
And what's cute about this diagram,
this,

180
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:02,020
it's actually a front is piece of a book,
is that you see Ptolemy,

181
00:12:02,021 --> 00:12:06,760
who his model has been discarded as an
old man that's sitting underneath there,

182
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:09,410
right? And you have, uh,

183
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:12,970
also you have the one eyed argus
who is looking through a telescope.

184
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:15,580
So the telescope,
Galileo by 16,

185
00:12:15,581 --> 00:12:19,540
early 16 hundreds has repurposed the
spyglass and has turned it to look at the

186
00:12:19,541 --> 00:12:20,374
sky.

187
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:25,380
And that was really the beginning of
recording in much more detail celestial

188
00:12:26,741 --> 00:12:30,190
phenomena. And that
already appears now. Uh,

189
00:12:30,210 --> 00:12:34,810
so the instrument's
starts to appear in the,

190
00:12:34,811 --> 00:12:39,811
what would follow was an age where the
interplay of ideas and instruments would

191
00:12:39,881 --> 00:12:44,770
kind of lead us to where we are right now.
So where are we now?

192
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:49,870
So what we know, we know quite a
lot about the cosmos at the moment.

193
00:12:49,871 --> 00:12:53,890
We know that, uh, they are
universe started with a big bang,

194
00:12:53,891 --> 00:12:57,250
which is basically a very
hot, dense state. It expanded.

195
00:12:57,251 --> 00:12:59,530
There was a period of
extremely rapid expansion,

196
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:03,040
exponential expansion called inflation,
which lasted for a very short time.

197
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:07,900
But then after that we've had steady
expansion deal about five to 7 billion

198
00:13:07,901 --> 00:13:09,380
years ago when the expert,
uh,

199
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:13,210
when the expansion once
again started accelerating.

200
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:16,900
So we also know the sequence
of events in the universe.

201
00:13:16,901 --> 00:13:18,790
We know that there are relics,

202
00:13:18,791 --> 00:13:22,840
Tomal relics of the heart universe
that you see as the cosmic microwave

203
00:13:22,841 --> 00:13:24,070
background radiation.

204
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:28,840
And then we have now uncovered the epoch
when probably most likely the first

205
00:13:28,841 --> 00:13:33,430
stars formed. And we know the
sequence by which, uh, galaxies form.

206
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:36,250
And we also know the contents,

207
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:40,720
the fate and the geometry of the universe
are actually interlinked thanks to

208
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:42,640
Einstein's theory of general relativity.

209
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:47,590
But the puzzling thing that we do
know is that much of the matter in the

210
00:13:47,591 --> 00:13:52,591
universe is dark matter and it is most
likely a set of particles that interact

211
00:13:54,911 --> 00:13:56,860
very,
very weakly with each other.

212
00:13:57,310 --> 00:14:00,250
And therefore the only
interaction is gravity.

213
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:02,920
They do not Emmett
absorb or reflect light.

214
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:04,960
So there is no electro magnetic coupling.

215
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:08,740
And the only way you would
see dark matter is indirectly.

216
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,380
But the interesting
thing is the pie chart,

217
00:14:11,381 --> 00:14:14,890
which is the contents of our universe,
is that the majority,

218
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:17,890
the 90% of the matter content,

219
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:21,130
which is the green and the
scion wedge of the Pie,

220
00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:25,770
I'm 90% of matter is actually dark
matter and the stuff that we are made of,

221
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:30,550
the ordinary items, this stuff in the
periodic table is only 4% ish. And,

222
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:33,250
and of course everything other than,
um,

223
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:37,280
more heavier than lithium was
synthesized in the centers of stars.

224
00:14:37,281 --> 00:14:41,470
So was synthesized quite late in the
universe in terms of the timeline. So,

225
00:14:41,471 --> 00:14:44,800
and it also turns out that
our current understanding, um,

226
00:14:45,570 --> 00:14:50,410
suggest that dark matter is actually
in the driving seat of structuring the

227
00:14:50,411 --> 00:14:52,490
cosmos.
All galaxies,

228
00:14:52,491 --> 00:14:56,090
all the structure that we
see is seeded by dark matter.

229
00:14:57,650 --> 00:15:01,380
So now I yup,
sure

230
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:08,060
measure it's percentage. So
it's a rub as intense. So

231
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:13,250
it's energy. So it's energy,
energy, density. Yeah.

232
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:17,360
So,
um,

233
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:22,730
what I want to do today is to take you
through sort of the life history of two

234
00:15:22,731 --> 00:15:27,590
very radical ideas. And they're
similar in some ways, these ideas.

235
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,350
And yet there are quite a difference.

236
00:15:29,351 --> 00:15:33,230
So the two ideas are the idea of
dark matter and of black holes.

237
00:15:33,231 --> 00:15:37,340
So they're both sort of invisible entities
in the university are unseen and get,

238
00:15:37,341 --> 00:15:40,250
we can map them because of the,
um,

239
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:44,900
the effects that they exert
around their vicinity. Right.

240
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:48,970
And the difference between these
two ideas is that dark matte,

241
00:15:48,971 --> 00:15:51,710
the discovery of dark matter
was entirely empirical.

242
00:15:51,711 --> 00:15:56,711
So it was observations that suggested
the need for a missing component as we'll

243
00:15:57,381 --> 00:15:58,214
just see.

244
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:02,180
Whereas back holes where
actually predicted there
were a mathematical solution,

245
00:16:02,181 --> 00:16:06,770
the fact that they actually correspond
to real astrophysical objects came quite

246
00:16:06,771 --> 00:16:07,790
late.
So,

247
00:16:07,791 --> 00:16:12,410
and you'll see why there's sort of
these observed mathematical objects. Um,

248
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:17,440
and it's hard to kind of imagine that
there could be natural physical objects in

249
00:16:17,931 --> 00:16:20,360
the universe that would
have the properties,

250
00:16:20,361 --> 00:16:24,150
the peculiar properties that
we think, uh, black holes have.

251
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:29,840
And so, um, you know, in a way the
essential is invisible to the eyes, right?

252
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:33,500
Uh, is a quote from the Fox in the
little prince. For those of you,

253
00:16:33,501 --> 00:16:36,500
I'm a little obsessed with the little
prince. It's one of my favorite stories.

254
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:38,390
And so, you know, the human imagination,

255
00:16:38,391 --> 00:16:43,250
we've always been fascinated with what
is unseen, what is unreachable, uh,

256
00:16:43,251 --> 00:16:45,080
what is just beyond reach,
right?

257
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:50,360
But there is a real checkered history for
these unseen, um, fluids and elements,

258
00:16:50,361 --> 00:16:54,030
right? So, and during medieval
times in pre-scientific, uh,

259
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:57,590
times when they didn't have an
explanation for a phenomenon,

260
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:00,480
you always had some kind of
invisible fluid that was invoked.

261
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:03,860
So you had my asthma, you had flow
just on before oxygen was discovered,

262
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:05,660
and then of course you had ether,
right?

263
00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:10,070
So you can imagine
immediately that when ideas,

264
00:17:10,071 --> 00:17:14,930
these ideas were proposed,
that the board was very high and you know,

265
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:15,550
the,

266
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:20,260
the discoveries of these
ideas held back and, uh,

267
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:25,270
we're not comfortable with discussing
what looked like growing evidence for the

268
00:17:26,001 --> 00:17:28,850
existence of yet another unseen entity,
right?

269
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:32,990
Because the other unseen entities
have had a very checkered past, right?

270
00:17:32,991 --> 00:17:37,790
They've all been shown
to be a humbug. So, um,

271
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40,250
what, so what I, uh,

272
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:45,280
want to do now is to give you a sense of
the history of the idea of a black hole

273
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:48,320
and,
uh,

274
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:51,810
sort of leading into the properties
of black holes and what we know today.

275
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:54,150
What's the, um, what's the frontier today?

276
00:17:55,230 --> 00:17:59,190
And so black holes,
um,

277
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:00,540
as I mentioned,

278
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:05,010
our mathematical solutions to Einstein's
and exact mathematical solution to

279
00:18:05,011 --> 00:18:06,240
Einstein's field equations,

280
00:18:06,241 --> 00:18:09,900
he actually did not think that
there could be exact solutions.

281
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:13,980
It was a complicated set of equations and
he expected only approximate solution.

282
00:18:13,981 --> 00:18:16,370
So he was very stunned
when, very, you know,

283
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:20,400
four months after he actually presented
his theory of general relativity,

284
00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:24,810
Carl's swaths child came up with this
solution for, uh, for the black hole.

285
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:29,460
But the idea of a black hole
and the popular idea of a
black hole is really that

286
00:18:29,461 --> 00:18:33,030
it's a point of no return because we
all have an understanding of this event

287
00:18:33,031 --> 00:18:37,440
horizon, this region outside the black
hole. We're not even light can escape,

288
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:42,180
but there's a very interesting
origin to that idea. So in Newtonian,

289
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,240
in the Newtonian Universe,
uh,

290
00:18:45,241 --> 00:18:49,050
he believed Newton believed that light
was made of particles. He's corpuscles.

291
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:53,370
So there was a very interesting,
uh, scholar man of the
cloth that John Mitchell,

292
00:18:53,371 --> 00:18:54,181
who was in Cambridge,

293
00:18:54,181 --> 00:18:58,010
who then cleverly came up with the idea
that if you had a very massive star,

294
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:01,980
it would just attract all the capacities
of light and therefore not even light

295
00:19:01,981 --> 00:19:06,360
would escape and you would get a dark
star. So this idea of a dark star,

296
00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:10,620
a point of a place of no return
even for light was proposed,

297
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:15,120
not in terms of general relativity,
but it really in a Newtonian universe.

298
00:19:15,810 --> 00:19:20,460
And the actual astrophysical
use of this term, uh,

299
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:23,760
was promoted by John Wheeler in the 1960s.

300
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:27,930
And what really made black holds real
astrophysical objects eventually,

301
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:29,190
um,

302
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:34,190
are the discovery of pulsars by bell and
Huish and the discovery of quasars in

303
00:19:35,731 --> 00:19:37,410
the 1960s and seventies.

304
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:42,630
But I was incredibly amazed to find
that the concept of a black hole and the

305
00:19:42,631 --> 00:19:45,930
term black hole actually
originated in Calcutta.

306
00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:49,740
It's an infamous prison and
Calcutta where the Nawab,

307
00:19:49,741 --> 00:19:52,980
she Raja Dhalla in 1756 in prison,

308
00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:56,670
a whole bunch of offices from the east
India company that was just starting to

309
00:19:56,671 --> 00:20:01,020
have colonial ambitions in India. And so
they were imprisoned in the small cell,

310
00:20:01,021 --> 00:20:03,090
which was about eight feet by six feet.

311
00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:06,210
And supposedly there's a lot of
mythology about this, you know,

312
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:10,440
several hundred soldiers were crammed
into this and very few of them made it out

313
00:20:10,441 --> 00:20:13,170
alive.
So this was a point place of no return.

314
00:20:13,171 --> 00:20:16,140
So it was a place and it
was a place of no return.

315
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:19,560
I said this concept pre dates,
the mathematical idea,

316
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:21,360
the scientific idea of the black hole.

317
00:20:21,361 --> 00:20:25,560
And in a way the storm was co
opted from popular culture.

318
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:29,160
So let's move onto what
a black hole really is.

319
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:32,430
So one of the easiest way
to think about a black hole,

320
00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:34,830
there are a bunch of
different ways and um, I'll,

321
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:36,540
I'll try to take you through them.

322
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:40,050
And they're useful when you want to
under understand particular kinds of

323
00:20:40,051 --> 00:20:44,670
phenomena about black holes. So there's a
notion of escape speed. So, for example,

324
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:49,300
um, in order for, um, you know,
when we launched satellites,

325
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:53,680
uh, in order for the satellite
to escape its gravity,

326
00:20:53,681 --> 00:20:58,120
you have to boost it to get it out of
the gravitational field. So for example,

327
00:20:58,121 --> 00:21:03,121
if you imagine the escape velocity
from an object of a given mass m is,

328
00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:08,950
if that is the speed of light,
that is the definition of a black hole.

329
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:11,800
So basically you cannot,
and as you all know,

330
00:21:11,801 --> 00:21:13,600
that speed of light is
the cosmic speed limit.

331
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:15,580
There's nothing that can
exceed the speed of light.

332
00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:19,360
So one way of thinking about black
holes are basically their entities who's

333
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:23,740
escape velocity is the speed of light.
And so for example,

334
00:21:23,741 --> 00:21:26,290
if the,
if the density,

335
00:21:26,291 --> 00:21:30,550
if the earth had to be
packed as densely and would,

336
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:34,780
would have to have the gravity that's
exerted by the gravitational field exerted

337
00:21:34,781 --> 00:21:37,930
by equivalently equivalent
to that of a black hole,

338
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:42,940
all the matter in the earth would have to
be crushed to less than one centimeter.

339
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:47,560
So that's how dense and that's how
compacted would have to be. Um,

340
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:52,030
so now, um, but the real
idea of black holes, um,

341
00:21:52,090 --> 00:21:53,680
was proposed by Einstein.

342
00:21:53,681 --> 00:21:58,681
And Einstein is a very interesting case
and I talk about this very peculiar

343
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:01,780
feature of his,

344
00:22:01,781 --> 00:22:06,760
which is he came up with some of the
most radical ideas in physics in the last

345
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:09,220
hundred years. Um, uh,
without a doubt. Um,

346
00:22:09,670 --> 00:22:13,990
and Edo reconceptualized Newtonian
gravity theory of general relativity,

347
00:22:13,991 --> 00:22:16,420
the photoelectric effect, you
know, quantum mechanics. I mean,

348
00:22:16,421 --> 00:22:19,900
he's just made so many contributions,
but he's notorious for one thing,

349
00:22:19,901 --> 00:22:24,100
which is when the implications of his
own ideas get worked out by others,

350
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:27,320
he often doesn't like them and
he pushes back his own idea.

351
00:22:27,321 --> 00:22:29,830
So he did not believe in black
holes for very long time,

352
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:32,350
just as he did not believe
in the expanding universe.

353
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:35,040
There's a very famous story.
So in the expanding investment,

354
00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:39,280
Hubble discovered that the distances
between galaxies was changing,

355
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:42,850
um, that galaxies were
speeding away from each other.

356
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:46,060
And the speed with which they were moving
away from each other was proportional

357
00:22:46,061 --> 00:22:48,970
to their distance from us.
The so called hobbled law,

358
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:52,660
Einstein was a holdout.
He did not believe this.

359
00:22:52,661 --> 00:22:57,130
And it took him many years and only after
a huge amount of data because he had a

360
00:22:57,131 --> 00:23:01,660
classical belief in a steady universe.
It was too disorienting.

361
00:23:01,930 --> 00:23:05,890
He liked the classical notion of fixed
stars and somehow the universe being

362
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:11,080
static and fixed. And so, um,
there's, um, there's an, um,

363
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:15,520
uh, there was a seminar in 1929 when
Einstein is supposed to have stood up and

364
00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:19,790
finally said, okay, I concede to
hobble that, you know, yes, the, um,

365
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:23,730
university is expanding, but then
recently colleagues of mine found, uh,

366
00:23:23,870 --> 00:23:25,290
in the Jerusalem,
um,

367
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:28,960
Einstein Archives and unpublished
manuscript because do is incorrect.

368
00:23:29,170 --> 00:23:30,430
Him Trying Einstein,

369
00:23:30,431 --> 00:23:33,610
trying to recover a static
universe solution two years later,

370
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:34,840
even after having publicly.

371
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:39,840
So He's notorious for not liking the
implications of his own radical ideas.

372
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,040
So it was no different with black holes.

373
00:23:42,041 --> 00:23:46,520
He absolutely did not like the idea of
the black hole because of the fact that

374
00:23:46,521 --> 00:23:48,660
the black hole and cases,
a singularity,

375
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:52,850
it's a place where all known physical
laws breakdown. And to Einstein,

376
00:23:52,851 --> 00:23:54,950
that was very,
very uncomfortable.

377
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:59,240
And he could not imagine that nature
would permit such a state that you could

378
00:23:59,241 --> 00:24:01,610
evolve to such a state or you
would have such an object.

379
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:06,260
So the amazing thing about general
relativity is that Einstein had this very

380
00:24:06,261 --> 00:24:10,370
deep insight and he kind of married
physics and geometry in a way.

381
00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:12,250
And unlike our Newton,

382
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:16,850
he actually gave an explanation for
gravity and he gave an explanation where

383
00:24:16,890 --> 00:24:19,580
gravity is really the
interaction of spacetime,

384
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:22,130
this four dimensional entity with matter.

385
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:27,340
And that basically matter causes
potholes or divots in space time and,

386
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:32,750
and these divots. And therefore
the curvature of space time, um,

387
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:38,270
determines how objects move, how
masses actually move. Right? So,

388
00:24:38,271 --> 00:24:39,104
um,

389
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:44,150
so a simple way to think about
Einstein's reconceptualization radical

390
00:24:44,151 --> 00:24:49,151
reconceptualization of Newton's gravity
is the effect that matter has on,

391
00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:54,470
uh, on space time. And if you can imagine
spacetime to be a sheet. So if you have,

392
00:24:54,471 --> 00:24:59,350
um, the sun, you can see the divert.
It's a pivot. It's a pothole that, uh,

393
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:03,770
is generated in spacetime and
it will impact the emotions of,

394
00:25:03,771 --> 00:25:07,520
as we'll see later, impact the emotions
of planet mercury, for example,

395
00:25:07,521 --> 00:25:10,340
which is lying very close to
the sun and a neutron star,

396
00:25:10,341 --> 00:25:13,430
which is much more densely
packed and more compact.

397
00:25:13,670 --> 00:25:18,670
Notice the port hole is deeper and the
black hole is very peculiar because it's

398
00:25:18,921 --> 00:25:23,570
actually an infinitely deep puncture in
spacetime. Okay. So, and this is why,

399
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,670
you know, it was an uncomfortable
concept. And so, um,

400
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:31,840
swash child found the solutions of what
a SWOT child found was the geometry of

401
00:25:32,091 --> 00:25:35,270
space time that corresponds to the region,

402
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:38,510
right around a very compact mass.

403
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:42,560
And so what is very peculiar is that
there is this region called the event

404
00:25:42,561 --> 00:25:44,510
horizon,
which is the point of no return.

405
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:48,710
But there are also these orbits where
the inner most tables, circular orbit,

406
00:25:48,711 --> 00:25:51,980
where you could be sort of in Dante
is limbo. If you were on that orbit,

407
00:25:51,981 --> 00:25:56,270
you could be there, uh, for infinity.
And, and, uh, the curious thing,

408
00:25:56,360 --> 00:26:01,250
things about black holes, it there
in their vicinity. Not only a space,

409
00:26:01,251 --> 00:26:05,800
the form, but the nature of time
also changes. So time slows down, um,

410
00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:07,040
next to a black hole.

411
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:11,780
So let me quickly move on to what our
current challenges are in terms of

412
00:26:11,781 --> 00:26:15,530
understanding black holes. And uh, it
really has to do with the formation,

413
00:26:15,531 --> 00:26:18,500
how you formed the first black holes,
how do you actually grow them,

414
00:26:18,501 --> 00:26:23,030
how you fuel them and do the black
holes actually impact their environment.

415
00:26:23,810 --> 00:26:26,300
And so this is a very,
very challenging problem.

416
00:26:26,490 --> 00:26:31,220
And I think many of you who work with
problems on that couple of many different

417
00:26:31,221 --> 00:26:35,620
scales of complexity will
understand this. Uh, and um,

418
00:26:36,530 --> 00:26:39,470
appreciate what the challenges for us.
So for example,

419
00:26:39,471 --> 00:26:42,320
the blackboard at the center of the Milky
ways a million times the mass of the

420
00:26:42,321 --> 00:26:46,420
sun, the Swa Schild radius or the event
horizon of that is the size, you know,

421
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:49,740
about 10 to the 12th I'm centimeters.
And if that was a penny,

422
00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:51,600
then the galactic nucleus,

423
00:26:51,601 --> 00:26:55,950
the inner region where the blackwood
exerts it's influence nowhere near our

424
00:26:55,951 --> 00:26:56,700
solar system,

425
00:26:56,700 --> 00:27:00,480
just the very inner regions of the
galaxy is just about eight orders of

426
00:27:00,481 --> 00:27:01,314
magnitude.

427
00:27:01,530 --> 00:27:05,880
And then the stellar component of the
galaxy spread out another eight orders of

428
00:27:05,881 --> 00:27:08,640
magnitude. And then the full
extent of the galaxy has,

429
00:27:08,641 --> 00:27:12,030
we'll just know because the galaxy is
going to be primarily dark matter and that

430
00:27:12,031 --> 00:27:13,530
extends quite far out.

431
00:27:14,010 --> 00:27:19,010
And then you connect onto cosmic scales
and basically the stellar extent of the

432
00:27:19,381 --> 00:27:21,180
galaxies already the size of the earth.

433
00:27:21,181 --> 00:27:24,180
And it's like having a penny in
the center of the earth. However,

434
00:27:24,181 --> 00:27:28,940
the energetics of black holes are so
immense that they do actually affect, uh,

435
00:27:29,010 --> 00:27:31,920
the vicinity. So the question is,
where do you find black holes?

436
00:27:31,921 --> 00:27:34,080
You'll find black old
supermassive black holes,

437
00:27:34,081 --> 00:27:38,100
which are about a million times the mass
of the sun in the centers of almost all

438
00:27:38,101 --> 00:27:42,750
galaxies. And so I want to
show you an artist's rendition.

439
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:48,950
Let me see. Yup. Uh, so this is real,
the Hubble space telescope data.

440
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:50,360
But once you go into the black hole,

441
00:27:50,361 --> 00:27:53,300
we cannot map the inner most
regions of the black hole.

442
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:58,010
And now we are going to march over to
an artist's rendition of this accretion

443
00:27:58,011 --> 00:28:01,190
disk, which is the feeding
gas disc for black hole,

444
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:05,720
which will appear now in the center
of the frame. And black holes are, um,

445
00:28:05,810 --> 00:28:09,920
the accretion process.
So as gas falls onto the black hole,

446
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:15,610
it gets heated and the temperature is
about a million to 10 million Calvin.

447
00:28:15,611 --> 00:28:18,430
So you'd start radiating in
the x rays and an optical.

448
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:22,780
So you actually see the dying gasps of
material before they make it into the

449
00:28:22,781 --> 00:28:24,970
black hole. And that's how
black holes are revealed to us.

450
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:29,500
And the supermassive black holes that
are growing very actively and accreting

451
00:28:29,501 --> 00:28:31,510
gas or water quasars,
they actually can,

452
00:28:31,630 --> 00:28:34,060
they're so bright that they
can outshine an entire galaxy.

453
00:28:34,061 --> 00:28:37,570
And these are the most distant objects
that we actually have access to.

454
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:41,470
And so it turns out that black
holes actually come into states.

455
00:28:41,530 --> 00:28:45,100
They're either fasting or
they're feasting, they're
basically Benjie objects.

456
00:28:45,610 --> 00:28:48,970
And so you either they're actively
creating and growing with gas,

457
00:28:48,971 --> 00:28:50,320
and then you'll see them as quite as ours.

458
00:28:50,321 --> 00:28:54,430
They out trying their host galaxies
or you have the guy, a black hole,

459
00:28:54,431 --> 00:28:57,870
like the one, the center of our galaxy,
which is essentially not feeling,

460
00:28:57,871 --> 00:29:01,720
it's fasting. There's almost no gas there
is just sitting there, right? And it,

461
00:29:01,721 --> 00:29:02,501
it has gravity.

462
00:29:02,501 --> 00:29:06,310
So it does influence the motion of
stars right around the black hole.

463
00:29:06,311 --> 00:29:11,200
And in fact this is the most
incontrovertible evidence
that we have for the

464
00:29:11,201 --> 00:29:15,400
existence of a black hole period and for
existence of a black hole in the center

465
00:29:15,401 --> 00:29:19,630
of our galaxy. So what do you really
see here are orbits of Real Stars.

466
00:29:19,631 --> 00:29:24,631
This is data taken at the Keck
telescope and you will see that,

467
00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:28,360
you know, we are far enough
away the gender relativities,

468
00:29:28,870 --> 00:29:32,740
it's beyond the regime of general
relativity because we see nice classical

469
00:29:32,741 --> 00:29:35,980
capillary and on Orbitz here,
right? So we are, you know,

470
00:29:35,981 --> 00:29:40,240
we just knew Tony and understanding,
we can figure out the mass of the object,

471
00:29:40,241 --> 00:29:42,570
which is shown as a,
and that's where the 4 million,

472
00:29:43,270 --> 00:29:47,020
4 million times the mass of the solar
masses comes from, from that measurement.

473
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:51,820
And so this is just to show you where
we are in terms of understanding how gas

474
00:29:51,821 --> 00:29:53,800
actually makes it into a black hole.

475
00:29:54,130 --> 00:29:57,100
So one thing we still don't understand
what is an unsolved problem,

476
00:29:57,101 --> 00:30:00,640
although we have some ideas, is how do
you actually lose the angular momentum?

477
00:30:00,641 --> 00:30:03,880
You have to lose the Anglo momentum
before you actually make it into the hole.

478
00:30:04,090 --> 00:30:08,590
So we have lots of ideas about structures
that you could have that would enable

479
00:30:08,591 --> 00:30:10,000
mass to move inward and you know,

480
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:13,900
went to him to move outward like some
kind of viscosity and disks and so on.

481
00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:17,500
So our current understanding is you have
some kind of feeding bisque from which

482
00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:20,950
mattered rains onto the
black hole. So this is a, um,

483
00:30:21,030 --> 00:30:24,820
a simulation from a one of
my former graduate students,

484
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:29,500
which actually shows you, um,
the, uh, what really happens,

485
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:32,530
what are the feeding episodes
for black holes? Like,

486
00:30:32,531 --> 00:30:35,920
so structure in the universal
assembles mostly by mergers,

487
00:30:35,921 --> 00:30:39,910
by mergers of galaxies. And what you
see here are two spiral galaxies,

488
00:30:39,911 --> 00:30:43,360
gastric spiral galaxies that
have accreting black holes.

489
00:30:43,361 --> 00:30:46,600
And the flickering tells you the accretion
that the fact that the accretion is

490
00:30:46,601 --> 00:30:50,250
on and these black holes are
actually actively growing dude, uh,

491
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:55,030
during the merger process. So
what's very interesting is the, um,

492
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:57,400
the merger itself is quite violent.
In the end,

493
00:30:57,401 --> 00:31:00,550
you'll have these two galaxies
merge their dark matter Halos,

494
00:31:00,551 --> 00:31:03,940
which you don't see here a merge,
the stars merge,

495
00:31:03,941 --> 00:31:08,110
they get spewed out and the black holes
actually merge as well in the end.

496
00:31:08,111 --> 00:31:12,580
And this is another way to grow a black
hole by actually literally tracking them

497
00:31:12,581 --> 00:31:14,620
and merging.
And as you may all remember,

498
00:31:14,621 --> 00:31:18,300
we actually saw this merger
happen for lower mass black hole.

499
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:21,640
I am interested in the supermassive
black holes, but what we saw,

500
00:31:21,641 --> 00:31:26,050
legos detection of gravitational waves
came from the merger of two 30 solar mass

501
00:31:26,051 --> 00:31:28,780
black holes. So, and this is um,

502
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:32,920
one of my earliest simulations,
which is gives you,

503
00:31:32,921 --> 00:31:36,580
so this is a top view of a very
supermassive black hole in the center.

504
00:31:36,581 --> 00:31:41,560
And you have a second one that falls
into the disc and how it plows and makes

505
00:31:41,561 --> 00:31:46,500
its way into the disc.
And you'll see a,

506
00:31:46,510 --> 00:31:48,070
what you see is the surface,

507
00:31:48,130 --> 00:31:52,240
the mass distribution in that disk is the
yellow curb that you see in the panel.

508
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:55,510
And what you see here is the
second black hole has plunked in.

509
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:58,480
And one of the most interesting
this is by now, this is all work,

510
00:31:58,481 --> 00:32:02,170
but this at the time was kind of
revolutionary because we realized what the

511
00:32:02,171 --> 00:32:05,530
timescales for the flows are
extremely long in this problem.

512
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:09,460
But we noticed something very interesting
happens that the inner portion of the

513
00:32:09,461 --> 00:32:13,420
disc gets detached from the
outer and the inner portion.

514
00:32:13,450 --> 00:32:16,720
Actually the timescales, the smaller
disk, the timescales are very short.

515
00:32:16,930 --> 00:32:21,930
So you can actually merge two black holes
very rapidly if you have a gas disc.

516
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:26,920
And what you see as waves are density
waves that are generated in the accretion

517
00:32:26,921 --> 00:32:29,980
disk, which are potentially
observable because you'd get emission,

518
00:32:29,981 --> 00:32:34,000
you'd get shocks from them and you could
probably get flares that we would see.

519
00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:39,620
So as you all know, the breakthrough
really, uh, um, in the Lygo detection,

520
00:32:39,621 --> 00:32:41,030
really the behind the scene,

521
00:32:41,031 --> 00:32:44,570
what really happened was an amazing
breakthrough in computational gr.

522
00:32:45,050 --> 00:32:46,730
And for 25 years,

523
00:32:46,731 --> 00:32:51,650
there had been no progress on how to
model the merger of two black holes in the

524
00:32:51,651 --> 00:32:53,930
regime,
not the regime where it's Kepler's laws,

525
00:32:53,931 --> 00:32:57,770
but in the regime by general relativity
matters. And so there was a breakthrough,

526
00:32:57,820 --> 00:32:58,653
um,
um,

527
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:03,880
mostly attribute it to a Franz Pretorius
who is a Princeton who came up with a

528
00:33:04,311 --> 00:33:08,450
new computational trick to actually model
the punctures in space time and their

529
00:33:08,451 --> 00:33:09,284
mergers.

530
00:33:09,290 --> 00:33:13,130
And you needed that so that you could
then template what the events would look

531
00:33:13,131 --> 00:33:16,730
like. And without the templates, you
wouldn't know how to pick out the signal.

532
00:33:16,731 --> 00:33:19,910
So this is a, you must have all
seen, this was just incredible.

533
00:33:19,911 --> 00:33:23,240
I really did not imagine it what
happened in my and my lifetime.

534
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:27,200
But what I'm really waiting for is the
merger of supermassive black holes,

535
00:33:27,201 --> 00:33:31,280
which is much lower frequency
than the lego event. And it needs,

536
00:33:31,281 --> 00:33:35,660
these detectors are Lygo like arm
interferometer in space and that is being

537
00:33:35,661 --> 00:33:40,370
planned by the Europeans and NASA is
reluctantly but slowly joining in on the

538
00:33:40,371 --> 00:33:45,320
Gip. And so hopefully that window
will be open because that is the,

539
00:33:45,321 --> 00:33:48,470
that's the signal you would get from the
merger of the supermassive black holes.

540
00:33:48,471 --> 00:33:52,280
And we think that the
mergers of supermassive black
holes are very significant.

541
00:33:52,310 --> 00:33:54,830
Early on in the university,
they structured the galaxy,

542
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:58,790
they control the modulators,
star formation in galaxies and so on.

543
00:33:58,790 --> 00:34:01,190
So it would really be
important to detect that.

544
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:04,460
So let me quickly now move on
to the idea of dark matter.

545
00:34:04,461 --> 00:34:08,090
And the way we detect dark matter
is the impact, the dark matter.

546
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:13,640
It's impact of dark matter on dynamics
and the motions of stars in a galaxy or

547
00:34:13,641 --> 00:34:16,610
the motion of galaxies in a cluster.

548
00:34:16,611 --> 00:34:21,320
And a cluster is an agglomeration of
about a thousand galaxies that are held

549
00:34:21,321 --> 00:34:24,620
together as we'll see by
huge amounts of dark matter.

550
00:34:24,621 --> 00:34:28,040
They are the largest repositories
of dark matter in the universe.

551
00:34:28,250 --> 00:34:31,580
And the other thing, so that is if you
want to think classically Allah Newton,

552
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:34,560
but if you want to think our Einstein,
uh,

553
00:34:34,561 --> 00:34:37,520
and use a phenomenon that was
predicted in general relativity,

554
00:34:37,521 --> 00:34:41,490
which is the bending of light light
traversing through all those potholes

555
00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:45,230
generated by all the matter in
the universe, then that data,

556
00:34:45,231 --> 00:34:49,580
gravitational lensing also points to
the existence of a huge amount of dark

557
00:34:49,581 --> 00:34:53,000
matter. And in fact, I'm going to, um, um,

558
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:56,480
clarify to you that one of the reasons,
you know, I often get asked, I mean,

559
00:34:56,481 --> 00:34:58,580
it's dark matter also,
one of these is a place holder.

560
00:34:58,581 --> 00:35:01,280
You don't know what's going on.
Is it going to go away like ether?

561
00:35:01,610 --> 00:35:03,920
I think there's a reason it's
not actually going to go away.

562
00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:07,190
It is embarrassing that we are yet
to find the dark matter particle,

563
00:35:07,191 --> 00:35:10,580
but that's because I think we're not
quite looking comprehensively like we

564
00:35:10,581 --> 00:35:13,760
should, we kind of locked into certain
bits of parameter space where we've been

565
00:35:13,761 --> 00:35:16,130
searching and we've been
unsuccessful so far.

566
00:35:16,550 --> 00:35:20,630
But the history of the idea of dark
matter is attributed to this cantankerous

567
00:35:20,631 --> 00:35:24,410
astronomer, Fritz Zwicky,
who was at Caltech. Um,

568
00:35:24,470 --> 00:35:28,700
and so what he did was he looked at
the speeds of galaxies in this cluster

569
00:35:28,701 --> 00:35:30,380
called coma,
which is a nearby cluster.

570
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:32,870
And that's an image on old
image of the coma cluster.

571
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:37,500
And he looked and he founded the
velocities of the galaxies that were going

572
00:35:37,501 --> 00:35:40,110
around. They were held together
by the gravity of something.

573
00:35:40,410 --> 00:35:43,800
And he realized that there had to be some
kind of Dunkel material, dark matter,

574
00:35:43,801 --> 00:35:48,801
that contributed to the gravitational
force that these test protocols we're

575
00:35:49,411 --> 00:35:52,320
feeling. And then he, in 1937,

576
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:54,960
Einstein already had predicted
gravitational lensing,

577
00:35:54,990 --> 00:35:58,440
which is the idea of the bending of
light because of the distortions in

578
00:35:58,510 --> 00:36:03,390
spacetime light from distant sources on
route to us. We'll sample every pothole.

579
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:07,440
I mean, and I like to remind, um, I'm
thinking about this all the time because,

580
00:36:07,441 --> 00:36:09,990
you know, my local highway near
new haven is [inaudible] 95.

581
00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:14,190
It has the best portholes believe me.
Um, and, uh, you know, I, you know,

582
00:36:14,191 --> 00:36:16,890
I came up with this analogy because I'm
driving there and you know, I was like,

583
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:20,730
oh, okay, this is it. Um, so, you know,
if you look at gravitational lensing,

584
00:36:20,731 --> 00:36:24,100
there's also incontrovertible
evidence. So let's look at, um,

585
00:36:24,210 --> 00:36:28,230
how this idea was, how it was
discovered. This concept of dark matter,

586
00:36:28,231 --> 00:36:32,910
and I said dark matter was
empirical, right? So who,
who you see here are, um, uh,

587
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:36,720
photographs are very Reuben
can't Ford and 300, um,

588
00:36:36,750 --> 00:36:41,100
these are the people who measured in the
1970s the speeds of stars in a spiral

589
00:36:41,101 --> 00:36:45,000
galaxy from the center outward.
And they found something kind of peculiar.

590
00:36:45,001 --> 00:36:48,420
So what you'll see in the white
curve is the measured value.

591
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:49,650
Why is that peculiar?

592
00:36:49,651 --> 00:36:53,160
So let's just come closer to home and
look at gravity in the solar system.

593
00:36:53,161 --> 00:36:56,670
If you look at the sun, which is a major
gravitating body in the solar system,

594
00:36:56,671 --> 00:36:59,790
and you look at the speeds of planets
from the sun outward, and you know,

595
00:36:59,791 --> 00:37:02,850
I have a bit of a blind spot.
Pluto still appears is a planet.

596
00:37:03,230 --> 00:37:05,200
I'm refusing to let that go.
Um,

597
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:09,330
and so you'll see the velocity of
planets is actually falls off as you go

598
00:37:09,331 --> 00:37:10,170
further out.

599
00:37:10,470 --> 00:37:14,970
And that tells you that gravitationally
dominant body in the solar system is the

600
00:37:14,971 --> 00:37:18,660
sun and it's in the center and
things fall off as expected.

601
00:37:19,410 --> 00:37:22,790
So contrast that with what you're finding
in galaxies completely the opposite.

602
00:37:22,810 --> 00:37:25,620
You see that the speeds are starting
to pick up in the inner regions,

603
00:37:25,890 --> 00:37:29,030
they actually stayed flat and that
tells you that there is some matter

604
00:37:29,050 --> 00:37:30,600
distribution,
some source of gravity,

605
00:37:30,601 --> 00:37:33,960
there's kind of holding up the galaxy
if you will, are pretty large radio.

606
00:37:33,961 --> 00:37:36,210
I in fact they continue as a flat.

607
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:39,360
These are core rotation curves and
they're pretty flat out to quite large

608
00:37:39,361 --> 00:37:42,660
distances and and so,
and this is not just one galaxy.

609
00:37:42,690 --> 00:37:44,910
This is typical of
pretty much every galaxy.

610
00:37:44,910 --> 00:37:48,510
So this is just the data and just to
drive home the contrast and it tells you

611
00:37:48,511 --> 00:37:52,350
that gravitationally you were completely
different situation in these two cases.

612
00:37:52,351 --> 00:37:54,240
So this is our current
conception of a galaxy,

613
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:57,000
that the stellar component is
just the tip of the iceberg.

614
00:37:57,240 --> 00:38:00,450
It's a five to 10% of the
total mass of the galaxy.

615
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:04,710
Most of it is unseen and it's dark
matter that is heaped in the center but

616
00:38:04,711 --> 00:38:09,480
extends out to very large radius,
almost 10 times further out.

617
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:14,130
Then you see the light in a galaxy which
is already pretty concentrated. And um,

618
00:38:14,430 --> 00:38:19,260
and this dark matter we think is made
of cold collision, less particles.

619
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:23,370
These particles that are very peculiar
that actually do not have pressure,

620
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:24,960
they don't collide so
they don't have pressure.

621
00:38:24,961 --> 00:38:28,770
So when they interact they just interact
gravitational, this go past each other.

622
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:33,480
Okay. And we are yet to find
the particle. Um, and there,

623
00:38:33,481 --> 00:38:36,990
there are many, many attempts to
look for it. So let me know. The,

624
00:38:36,991 --> 00:38:40,540
the discovery of light deflection is
kind of very, very interesting because,

625
00:38:40,870 --> 00:38:44,110
you know, even, uh, just Newton's ideas,

626
00:38:44,410 --> 00:38:47,470
if you thought of lightest corpuscles
and not as waves, you could,

627
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:51,850
you would have predicted deflection of
these particles by gravitational focusing

628
00:38:51,851 --> 00:38:54,370
when you go past something that's
really massive. And in fact,

629
00:38:54,371 --> 00:38:59,230
Soldner did just that in 1804. He
actually calculated that. And, um,

630
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:04,030
and oddly that value that's
in the Newtonian context.
Whereas if your content,

631
00:39:04,090 --> 00:39:08,410
if you computed in the
framework of general rights
or do you actually calculate

632
00:39:08,411 --> 00:39:13,300
the geodesics of life and then all your
desks of light as from distant sources

633
00:39:13,301 --> 00:39:14,134
coming to us,

634
00:39:14,350 --> 00:39:18,310
you actually find that value is just
a factor of two off classical value.

635
00:39:18,610 --> 00:39:21,340
And in fact,
when I'm in Nazi Germany,

636
00:39:21,341 --> 00:39:26,090
when there was pushback back against
Einstein, one of the things that, um,

637
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:29,500
the Nazis brought up was that,
you know, his new final ideas,

638
00:39:29,501 --> 00:39:32,230
we're not really needed.
General relativity was not needed.

639
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:37,060
They actually re had sold newspaper
republished because they said, well,

640
00:39:37,061 --> 00:39:41,440
you know, a great science has already
been done by Aryans and you know,

641
00:39:41,441 --> 00:39:45,310
this number was already calculated. So,
you know, so that there's some very,

642
00:39:45,311 --> 00:39:46,780
very interesting stories,

643
00:39:46,870 --> 00:39:51,370
backstories for all these radical ideas
and the push backs at various times,

644
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:54,190
not just from within science,
which is what I focused on,

645
00:39:54,191 --> 00:39:58,450
but in the larger culture right there.
It's a rich form of stories there. So,

646
00:39:58,451 --> 00:40:02,980
but the verification of general relativity
actually came from the confirmation

647
00:40:03,250 --> 00:40:06,790
of this prediction of light bending.
And it's a famous experiment,

648
00:40:06,791 --> 00:40:10,900
eclipse experiment in 1917
and 1919 by author Reddington.

649
00:40:11,230 --> 00:40:13,960
And so just to remind you
what that experiment was, um,

650
00:40:13,990 --> 00:40:15,280
it was a very cool experiment.

651
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:19,130
Basically during a solar eclipse you
have the earth moon and the sun line up.

652
00:40:19,131 --> 00:40:23,770
So you can see all the divots kind of
line up and you have light from distant

653
00:40:23,771 --> 00:40:27,820
stars would get deflected
maximally because there are
all these three pot holes

654
00:40:27,821 --> 00:40:29,830
that line up and what you end up seeing.

655
00:40:29,830 --> 00:40:31,480
And then once you're
done with the eclipse,

656
00:40:31,481 --> 00:40:35,290
you can go back to the same part of the
sky and look at the positions of stars.

657
00:40:35,291 --> 00:40:40,291
And you find that the actual positions
are different from the apparent positions

658
00:40:40,421 --> 00:40:42,850
during an eclipse.
And you can measure the deflection.

659
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:47,440
And it was right on where Einstein had
predicted. And today this is a very,

660
00:40:47,441 --> 00:40:50,970
very powerful tool. And
a lot of my work, uh,

661
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:55,270
on mapping dark matter relies
on using gravitational lensing.

662
00:40:55,271 --> 00:40:56,950
So the idea is very similar.

663
00:40:57,160 --> 00:41:01,240
You have distant galaxies in the universe
and you have a very massive cluster of

664
00:41:01,241 --> 00:41:02,074
galaxies,

665
00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:06,550
and there's an artist's impression of
the pothole that's generated by the dark

666
00:41:06,551 --> 00:41:07,660
matter that is unseen.

667
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:12,960
And so the light from this galaxy
gets deflected and what you end up,

668
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:17,950
what the effect of that is that you end
up seeing the distorted shape of that

669
00:41:17,951 --> 00:41:20,980
galaxy. You no longer see
the real trip. Luckily,

670
00:41:20,981 --> 00:41:24,700
dark matter is smeared lightly
everywhere in the universe,

671
00:41:24,970 --> 00:41:27,820
but it's lumped only
in very few locations,

672
00:41:27,821 --> 00:41:31,780
locations where galaxies form and
locations where clusters form or where you

673
00:41:31,781 --> 00:41:33,350
have a huge amount of dark matter.

674
00:41:33,770 --> 00:41:37,940
And therefore we know the distribution
of undistorted shapes of galaxies

675
00:41:37,941 --> 00:41:41,630
statistically. So when we look at a
place where they're distorted shapes,

676
00:41:41,810 --> 00:41:46,810
we can back out the entire distribution
of matter along a cylinder from us to

677
00:41:48,410 --> 00:41:50,270
the background sources.
So for example,

678
00:41:50,271 --> 00:41:53,780
this is a beautiful gravitational lens
discovered by the Hubble Space Telescope.

679
00:41:54,110 --> 00:41:57,050
Here the lens is an individual galaxy,
not a cluster.

680
00:41:58,930 --> 00:42:00,350
And you see the decomposition.

681
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:05,030
What you see actually projected on the
sky is this arc and the galaxy in the

682
00:42:05,031 --> 00:42:09,650
center of the Lens. In Galaxy in the
center. And when you work it out,

683
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:12,150
that is the original shape
of the source of the galaxy.

684
00:42:12,150 --> 00:42:16,550
It's a little wispy blue thing that's a
distant galaxy that star forming and it

685
00:42:16,551 --> 00:42:21,110
gets because of how it lines up with the
spot or it gets totally deflected and

686
00:42:21,111 --> 00:42:24,800
you see this deflected shape. This is just
another schematic to show you that. Uh,

687
00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:28,040
so to give you a sense,
so this is actually a mapping.

688
00:42:28,041 --> 00:42:30,500
So gravitational lensing
is a mapping if you will,

689
00:42:30,501 --> 00:42:35,450
from an a source plane to an image plan
and the source plane shapes to image

690
00:42:35,451 --> 00:42:36,284
plane shapes.

691
00:42:36,410 --> 00:42:40,070
And it turns out that there are regimes
where this mapping is not linear,

692
00:42:40,130 --> 00:42:41,810
it's not linear,
it's not one to one.

693
00:42:42,050 --> 00:42:44,330
And then there's a redeem where
this mapping is one to one.

694
00:42:44,630 --> 00:42:48,730
So the regime where the mapping is
one to one is called weak lensing. Um,

695
00:42:48,890 --> 00:42:53,360
and the regime where you have um,
gone linearities and the,

696
00:42:53,361 --> 00:42:56,360
it's a multi valued mapping,
it's called strong lensing.

697
00:42:56,660 --> 00:43:00,740
And the reason it's called strong lensing
is sometimes the divert is so deep.

698
00:43:00,741 --> 00:43:05,150
The pothole is so dramatic that if
you can think of light rays as tubes,

699
00:43:05,330 --> 00:43:06,800
you actually split the tube,

700
00:43:06,890 --> 00:43:11,890
you end up seeing multiple copies
of what is actually just one object.

701
00:43:12,330 --> 00:43:15,470
Okay?
So in this animation you see a range.

702
00:43:15,530 --> 00:43:20,530
So what you see in red is the surface
mass density of a cluster of galaxies,

703
00:43:21,381 --> 00:43:25,220
which gives you a sense of how
deep that pothole is going to be.

704
00:43:25,490 --> 00:43:29,420
And you had a background screen with
galaxies that were basically circular in

705
00:43:29,421 --> 00:43:30,950
shape just for illustration.

706
00:43:31,250 --> 00:43:34,040
And you can see the range of
shapes that you could get.

707
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:36,290
Nothing is moving in the university,
just Fannie Mae Nation,

708
00:43:36,291 --> 00:43:39,780
to show your range of shapes, right? That
you could get. And the point is we do,

709
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:43,280
we see all of those shapes and it
says Hubble Space Telescope data.

710
00:43:43,580 --> 00:43:46,400
And here you see five copies of a galaxy.

711
00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:49,700
And we know it's the same galaxy
because we have the spectrum,

712
00:43:49,701 --> 00:43:51,950
we go out and take the spectrum.
And another thing that, uh,

713
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:56,630
gravitational lensing does is because it's
preserved surface brightness, um, you,

714
00:43:56,631 --> 00:44:00,590
it magnifies these faint sources and
brings galaxies interview that you would

715
00:44:00,591 --> 00:44:01,520
otherwise not see.

716
00:44:01,521 --> 00:44:06,290
So clusters of galaxies and dark matter
act as very convenient in a sort of

717
00:44:06,291 --> 00:44:09,260
natural telescopes for us,
except we can't control them.

718
00:44:09,261 --> 00:44:13,070
They happened to be where they are, right?
And that's the bane of cosmology, right?

719
00:44:13,100 --> 00:44:16,760
That it's a no controlled
experiments. Right? Um, um,

720
00:44:16,780 --> 00:44:20,630
and so you see sort of five and you can
back out the dark matter distribution.

721
00:44:20,631 --> 00:44:24,840
So this is one of my favorite,
uh, clusters of galaxies
and other, you know, Hubble,

722
00:44:24,950 --> 00:44:26,900
so Hubble Space Telescope
transformed this field.

723
00:44:26,901 --> 00:44:30,260
This field could not have really moved
to the waste that he did without the

724
00:44:30,261 --> 00:44:32,670
Hubble space,
whether corrected optics of course,

725
00:44:33,690 --> 00:44:36,720
for those of you who might
remember. Um, so you have these,

726
00:44:36,721 --> 00:44:39,840
you can see by eye these
highly distorted sources.

727
00:44:40,050 --> 00:44:43,740
The fuzzy yellow things that you see
are galaxies that are in the cluster.

728
00:44:43,741 --> 00:44:47,610
So they are in the foreground and the
wispy things that are stretched out are

729
00:44:47,611 --> 00:44:50,810
the guys in the background. So their,
their shapes are deformed. I said,

730
00:44:50,820 --> 00:44:53,400
why is this important? And you may
say, well why is she going on and on?

731
00:44:53,580 --> 00:44:54,930
So this is a simulation,

732
00:44:54,931 --> 00:44:59,580
a slice of a simulation of a patch of
the universe where a cluster forms a

733
00:44:59,581 --> 00:45:04,320
cluster like the one that causes these
deviations in the light rail paths forms.

734
00:45:04,710 --> 00:45:07,450
And this is not light, this is
just mock it up to look like light.

735
00:45:07,470 --> 00:45:11,490
These are all dark matter particles and
the only interaction you have here is

736
00:45:11,491 --> 00:45:14,550
gravity. And this is just
aggregating due to gravity.

737
00:45:14,551 --> 00:45:16,590
These are collision less
dark matter particles.

738
00:45:16,970 --> 00:45:20,940
And this simulation we'll show you
that the dark matter distribution in.

739
00:45:20,941 --> 00:45:24,900
So that pink region is roughly the
cluster that you saw in sort of one of the

740
00:45:24,901 --> 00:45:29,790
Hubble space telescope images. And notice
the dark matter is very, very clumpy,

741
00:45:29,940 --> 00:45:32,250
right?
It's a lot of small scale structure.

742
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:36,780
And the reason we are very interested
in mapping dark matter and you know

743
00:45:36,781 --> 00:45:41,250
mapping it as explicitly as possible
catch capturing all the granularity of it

744
00:45:41,550 --> 00:45:45,170
is because there are fundamental
clue to the nature of dark matter in,

745
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:48,660
in the distribution. So, if
the dark matter is this cold,

746
00:45:48,661 --> 00:45:51,540
dark matter that had been telling you
about pressure, less collision less,

747
00:45:51,780 --> 00:45:55,080
it will be extremely clumpy. And if
it was a different kind of particle,

748
00:45:55,081 --> 00:45:57,360
a warm dark matter particle,
it would be a lot smoother.

749
00:45:57,660 --> 00:46:02,550
So the game now is to sales
particle physics has not
made progress in finding us.

750
00:46:02,550 --> 00:46:06,120
This particle is for astrophysics
to go and try to find clues.

751
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:10,710
And a question is, you know that if we
use gravitational lensing, for example,

752
00:46:10,711 --> 00:46:14,460
that scene here, um, what's the
verdict? What does it look like?

753
00:46:14,461 --> 00:46:17,910
So this is to give you a sense
of the kind of work that I do.

754
00:46:17,911 --> 00:46:19,800
And one of the reasons I
wanted to show this, uh,

755
00:46:19,801 --> 00:46:23,520
these give you a feel for this is that
we are happy to recruit any of you who

756
00:46:23,521 --> 00:46:28,170
wants to volunteer to, um, uh, to
participate in, um, in research,

757
00:46:28,171 --> 00:46:29,310
in any research projects.

758
00:46:29,730 --> 00:46:33,480
So what you see here in the yellow
bunny rabbit is the region, uh,

759
00:46:33,510 --> 00:46:37,030
behind which any source would
get multiple imaged. Okay.

760
00:46:37,290 --> 00:46:40,200
And everything outside is
basically the week lends in region.

761
00:46:40,201 --> 00:46:44,520
That's a nonlinear regime. And so
what you see here are the potential.

762
00:46:44,521 --> 00:46:46,320
So if you look,
you're looking at the,

763
00:46:46,380 --> 00:46:51,120
at the potential well of dark matter and
the equal potentials or those elongated.

764
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:55,230
And what you see are those galaxies
with the red, um, ellipsis.

765
00:46:55,260 --> 00:46:58,080
Those are the putative dark matter Halos,

766
00:46:58,081 --> 00:47:01,170
the dark matter associated with
individual Alice of galaxies.

767
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:02,640
And that's the granularity.

768
00:47:02,641 --> 00:47:05,550
And this is what a three dimensional
rendering of that looks like.

769
00:47:05,551 --> 00:47:09,630
So dark matter in clusters is
heaped in a smooth distribution.

770
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:14,450
And then there are lots of lumps, so
it's extremely clumpy. And so, um,

771
00:47:14,490 --> 00:47:17,190
it turns out, uh, so this is
the latest and the greatest.

772
00:47:17,191 --> 00:47:20,050
This is a paper that just came out.
Uh,

773
00:47:20,130 --> 00:47:23,430
so this is from a recent data
from the Hubble Space Telescope.

774
00:47:23,431 --> 00:47:27,390
What you see on the right hand side is
a reconstructed dark matter distribution

775
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:30,880
in the blue haze. This, the stuff
that you don't actually see that is,

776
00:47:30,881 --> 00:47:35,740
they're gravitationally. So where are
we? Uh, we've not detected dark matter.

777
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:38,050
Okay. And, uh, you know,

778
00:47:38,051 --> 00:47:41,140
there've been particle detection
experiments where basically it's a sodium

779
00:47:41,141 --> 00:47:45,700
iodide crystal, you're looking for
juggling in the crystal. No, no luck.

780
00:47:46,030 --> 00:47:47,680
You're looking for inert gases.

781
00:47:47,681 --> 00:47:52,030
We looking for motion of
dark matter particles through
that. No, no success yet.

782
00:47:53,380 --> 00:47:57,160
But there was one controversial claim
for the detection of having detected dark

783
00:47:57,161 --> 00:48:00,460
matter. So if dark matter, you
know, if we have these sort of,

784
00:48:00,461 --> 00:48:03,340
if we are enveloped in dark
matter, um, the solar system,

785
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:06,280
then as the seasons change and
our relative motion changes,

786
00:48:06,460 --> 00:48:09,820
they should be a dark matter wind
and we should see a correlation.

787
00:48:09,870 --> 00:48:13,610
We should see a modulation in
the a dark matter. So there's a,

788
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:16,960
there's a collaboration
Italian collaboration that
claimed to have found it

789
00:48:16,961 --> 00:48:20,800
about 15 years ago. Uh, and they did
not manage to persuade the community.

790
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:22,810
So the thing that's finally happening,

791
00:48:23,140 --> 00:48:26,320
which we would all been clamoring for
for while is a replication of that

792
00:48:26,321 --> 00:48:29,530
experiment. So the same company that
made the same sodium iodide crystal,

793
00:48:29,531 --> 00:48:33,250
it has made five replications and the
experiment is being repeated in Antartica,

794
00:48:33,251 --> 00:48:34,720
Spain, South Korea, Germany.

795
00:48:34,990 --> 00:48:38,350
And so we'll have to see in three years
we'll know if this experiment is results

796
00:48:38,351 --> 00:48:41,140
are going to hold up.
I'm not very optimistic about that,

797
00:48:41,470 --> 00:48:45,850
but I just want to conclude by
showing you what are we actually.

798
00:48:45,851 --> 00:48:48,430
So what is the goal? And
you know, and in a way,

799
00:48:48,431 --> 00:48:51,020
this is also personally what
the goal is, right? What,

800
00:48:51,021 --> 00:48:54,460
what are we really after and
what are people like me after?

801
00:48:55,300 --> 00:48:57,160
So I think that we are testing gravity.

802
00:48:57,161 --> 00:49:00,760
We know that the Einstein's theory
of general relativity is incomplete.

803
00:49:00,820 --> 00:49:04,240
And there it is not yet married to.
We don't have a quantum theory of gravity.

804
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:07,060
And string theorists have
been working and successfully,

805
00:49:07,350 --> 00:49:10,960
they've made some progress,
but still we don't quite have a theory.

806
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:13,720
And so what does the lesson, so, you know,

807
00:49:13,780 --> 00:49:15,790
history teaches us
something quite interesting.

808
00:49:15,820 --> 00:49:20,820
So in the 1,718 hundreds
there was a deviation scene
in the orbit of Uranus from

809
00:49:22,750 --> 00:49:26,410
Newton's predictions. And I'll be
in la, very, a French mathematician,

810
00:49:26,411 --> 00:49:30,160
astronomer predicted the
presence of another perturbing
planet that needed to be

811
00:49:30,161 --> 00:49:33,720
taken into account. And that was Neptune.
And it was found, and it was, you know,

812
00:49:33,730 --> 00:49:35,830
as he predicted it similarly,

813
00:49:35,831 --> 00:49:39,830
there was a deviation in the orbit of
mercury that was found. And Oban livery.

814
00:49:39,850 --> 00:49:41,830
I said, you know, use the same
explanation. He said, hey,

815
00:49:41,831 --> 00:49:44,840
there has to be a planet between
Mercury and son. He called it welcome.

816
00:49:44,841 --> 00:49:48,580
They were supposed sightings are welcome,
one can is not there. So you know,

817
00:49:48,581 --> 00:49:52,780
if you had to wait for another 74
years for Einstein's theory of general

818
00:49:52,781 --> 00:49:56,350
relativity to actually append
the Newton completely right.

819
00:49:56,351 --> 00:50:01,351
So in one case you just
needed a refinement of an
existing theory in another

820
00:50:01,421 --> 00:50:02,190
case.

821
00:50:02,190 --> 00:50:07,190
And a normally actually pointed the
way forward to a brand new theory.

822
00:50:07,330 --> 00:50:08,290
Although it was not,

823
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:12,100
it was not quite that this observation
did not inspire Einstein. Right.

824
00:50:12,101 --> 00:50:16,570
For Einstein is famous for having come
up with a theory of general relativity,

825
00:50:16,571 --> 00:50:20,740
sort of Eczema Hylo, right.
He did part experiments. He
did get Duncan experiments.

826
00:50:20,741 --> 00:50:25,210
He didn't actually, you know, do,
he was aware of the data, but uh,

827
00:50:25,211 --> 00:50:30,200
and one of the triumphs
was this explanation of the
anomalies in the anomalous

828
00:50:30,201 --> 00:50:34,340
precession of the orbit of
mercury. So, um, I just stop here.

829
00:50:34,820 --> 00:50:38,350
Thank you so much for your attention.
And I just want to conclude, wait,

830
00:50:38,390 --> 00:50:42,220
I'll just show this in the
background because it's a superb,

831
00:50:42,221 --> 00:50:45,530
a movie that massive made on.

832
00:50:45,531 --> 00:50:48,860
I've got an understanding of black holes
and a lot of the work that I've been

833
00:50:48,861 --> 00:50:51,110
doing over the years has
contributed to this movie.

834
00:50:51,111 --> 00:50:55,400
So I'm very pleased with
how it looks. So, um,

835
00:50:55,910 --> 00:50:59,790
what does actually shows you is our
observational access to black holes.

836
00:50:59,791 --> 00:51:03,350
So the x ray emission on exactly
where the ambition comes from.

837
00:51:03,350 --> 00:51:07,130
And for those of you will probably saw
interstellar and hopefully loved it like

838
00:51:07,131 --> 00:51:09,080
I did.
They did.

839
00:51:09,081 --> 00:51:12,260
They actually solve the real equations
of general relativity for the,

840
00:51:13,700 --> 00:51:15,530
for the light shadows around Gargantua.

841
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:18,770
And so this is the real McCoy.

842
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:23,780
So this is actually the gas and you'll
see the photon rings as well as show you

843
00:51:23,781 --> 00:51:27,560
the angle. So this is what
you see in the soft x rays.

844
00:51:27,620 --> 00:51:31,460
So the low energy x-rays, that's
the, to give you a perspective,

845
00:51:31,490 --> 00:51:34,010
that's the event horizon
size of the event horizon.

846
00:51:34,610 --> 00:51:37,460
And this is sort of the angle
from which we are viewing.

847
00:51:37,461 --> 00:51:41,690
So you have a central black hole and
this structure is the feeding accretion

848
00:51:41,691 --> 00:51:46,100
this,
but these are sort of the paths of life

849
00:51:49,770 --> 00:51:54,320
around the black hole and you have
this like inner a photon ring,

850
00:51:54,340 --> 00:51:57,290
this sort of limbo where
you would be in limbo.

851
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:03,500
And the motto that's calling in the gas
that's falling in his bed up to about

852
00:52:03,500 --> 00:52:05,840
half seat in the inner regions

853
00:52:07,810 --> 00:52:10,100
and this coloring of blue and red,

854
00:52:10,101 --> 00:52:14,090
which you seem sort of publish mixing
is sort of the red shifting and Lou

855
00:52:14,091 --> 00:52:16,180
shifting of gas that is
moving towards awesome.

856
00:52:16,220 --> 00:52:20,390
The way from us on you
also see heart emission,

857
00:52:20,391 --> 00:52:23,810
hot x ray emission, very, very
energetic photons coming from

858
00:52:25,820 --> 00:52:26,900
the accretion disk.

859
00:52:28,700 --> 00:52:33,700
And that actually comes from the random
scattering of gas and electronics.

860
00:52:43,230 --> 00:52:47,990
So this is the sort of kind of data
that we're actually getting now.

861
00:52:47,991 --> 00:52:52,991
So you get the extra spectra and we can
actually map it to spatially where in

862
00:52:54,531 --> 00:52:59,030
the context of this accretion disk model,
the radiation originates from.

863
00:52:59,450 --> 00:53:03,710
And actually there's a very exciting
new project called the event Horizon

864
00:53:03,710 --> 00:53:07,700
Telescope in which doesn't attempt to
measure that in a photon ring for the

865
00:53:07,701 --> 00:53:12,610
black hole in the center galaxy using
the entire earth as a radio telescope

866
00:53:12,611 --> 00:53:17,350
dish. Anyway, I will stop here finally.
Thank you so much for your patients.

867
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:21,580
Yes.

868
00:53:21,580 --> 00:53:24,700
So where are we ready with the
first question? Yeah, go ahead.

869
00:53:24,870 --> 00:53:26,220
So there's a question

870
00:53:26,220 --> 00:53:28,740
on the simulation of galaxies colliding.

871
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:31,890
It's an understanding gags that are mostly
empty space. And I was wondering what,

872
00:53:32,290 --> 00:53:35,250
uh, what we know about what would happen
to the contents of these galaxies.

873
00:53:35,251 --> 00:53:38,580
Like we just started start murmuring to
each other or just passing the night or

874
00:53:38,581 --> 00:53:39,450
become binary.

875
00:53:39,930 --> 00:53:41,980
Yeah, they buy, they would, as you saw,

876
00:53:42,190 --> 00:53:45,670
what you saw was the stories and the
gas that was shown in that rendition,

877
00:53:45,730 --> 00:53:46,780
both stars and gas.

878
00:53:47,080 --> 00:53:50,470
So you would have some fraction of the
stars would actually get splattered out

879
00:53:50,860 --> 00:53:54,520
and there would be a portion of it would
fall back, would be on elongated orbits,

880
00:53:54,521 --> 00:53:56,800
but they would come back and
splash back and fall back.

881
00:53:57,160 --> 00:54:00,490
But they would actually mix the Stella
components of the two galaxies would

882
00:54:00,491 --> 00:54:02,530
actually mix up and,
uh,

883
00:54:02,531 --> 00:54:07,270
you would form a much more concentrated
distribution of stars depending on the

884
00:54:07,271 --> 00:54:09,880
angle and the dynamics of the merger.

885
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:14,950
And we actually believe that a structure
built up hierarchy hierarchical in the

886
00:54:14,951 --> 00:54:18,970
universe through the merger of
small galaxies over cosmic time.

887
00:54:19,270 --> 00:54:22,810
So a, at early times you had
an abundance of small galaxies,

888
00:54:22,811 --> 00:54:27,490
small galaxies were formed first they
collide and you assembled more massive

889
00:54:27,491 --> 00:54:30,700
galaxies as time goes on. But
yes, they're very violent events.

890
00:54:30,701 --> 00:54:32,350
The energetics are pretty staggering.

891
00:54:34,140 --> 00:54:36,410
Uh, my first question for you is, um,

892
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:40,670
you didn't mention a gravity at all.
Yup.

893
00:54:40,740 --> 00:54:42,120
You start getting the reason for that.

894
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:43,350
Yeah.
Because I mean,

895
00:54:43,380 --> 00:54:47,430
a lot of the work that I've been talking
about is very much in the classical

896
00:54:47,431 --> 00:54:52,080
regime and the current observational
data is really restricted,

897
00:54:52,470 --> 00:54:56,640
you know, is, um, we don't need
quantum physics to interpret the data,

898
00:54:56,840 --> 00:54:59,760
maybe in a quantum gravity to
actually interpret the data.

899
00:54:59,970 --> 00:55:03,960
We need quantum physics to understand
how radiation, but, um, yeah,

900
00:55:04,020 --> 00:55:07,620
this is very much still in,
in the classical classical rigid.

901
00:55:07,990 --> 00:55:11,820
All right. So second question
is in that classical regime, uh,

902
00:55:11,821 --> 00:55:16,470
and a black hole, a coe. What
can you tell us about the, um,

903
00:55:16,840 --> 00:55:20,880
Eric goes for your frame
dragging and time travel? No.

904
00:55:21,870 --> 00:55:26,190
Okay. All, all, all of the
questions in one. Yeah. So, um,

905
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:31,050
the you do expect, as I said,
the nature of time also changes.

906
00:55:31,051 --> 00:55:32,400
So you expect this,

907
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:37,110
a frame dragging this effect is called
the Bardi in Patterson effect in the

908
00:55:37,111 --> 00:55:41,830
inner regions of black holes. And we
actually have evidence for that. Uh, uh,

909
00:55:41,850 --> 00:55:44,910
especially when you see two black
holes merging and you'll see the,

910
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:48,930
the frames that are being
dragged spacetime that's
been dragged as the margin.

911
00:55:49,260 --> 00:55:53,220
And the way that manifests is you'll
see some jitter in the jets that are

912
00:55:53,221 --> 00:55:58,020
produced by. So we think now that we
have a measurement of frame dragging,

913
00:55:58,050 --> 00:56:02,880
we can actually explain it in the context
of the models that we currently have

914
00:56:03,180 --> 00:56:08,040
of accretion disk around black
holes and jets. As for time travel,

915
00:56:08,060 --> 00:56:12,970
um, it's mathematically permitted,
but that doesn't mean that a,

916
00:56:12,990 --> 00:56:13,823
it's possible.

917
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:15,753
Thank you.

918
00:56:18,470 --> 00:56:23,450
Um, so you were talking about
a dark meadow, dark matter
halos around, um, you know,

919
00:56:23,750 --> 00:56:27,400
galaxies and so forth. Have we actually
observed like clumps of dark matter,

920
00:56:27,401 --> 00:56:30,340
independent of visible matter
of galaxies or things like that?

921
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:31,510
That's a great question.

922
00:56:31,540 --> 00:56:35,820
So that is a bill that's been the sort
of perennial quest. So at the moment, uh,

923
00:56:36,040 --> 00:56:40,960
we find that light and mass trace
each other quite well in the universe.

924
00:56:41,620 --> 00:56:46,500
It's not linear, it's not a one to one,
but, uh, typically, uh, we have not,

925
00:56:46,501 --> 00:56:51,130
we are yet to find clumps of dark
matter that do not have any stars or gas

926
00:56:51,460 --> 00:56:52,630
that's associated with them.

927
00:56:52,660 --> 00:56:56,770
The closest thing that we
have are these dwarf galaxies,

928
00:56:56,771 --> 00:56:59,470
which are these very
piddly low mass galaxies,

929
00:56:59,471 --> 00:57:04,090
about a billion times the mass of the
sun, the mass of the entire galaxy, right?

930
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:07,540
It's about a thousand. The
mass of the, uh, our galaxy.

931
00:57:07,980 --> 00:57:11,440
And these galaxies,
some of them are so tiny that you have,

932
00:57:11,480 --> 00:57:14,290
are either not formed very many stars.

933
00:57:14,291 --> 00:57:18,610
And so you see just hot gas and a
few stores that extremely dark matter

934
00:57:18,611 --> 00:57:22,050
dominated. And, and if you
did have stories earlier on,

935
00:57:22,060 --> 00:57:26,740
they will probably rejected. They're
such wimpy potential wells. The gravity,

936
00:57:26,770 --> 00:57:31,720
um, at early times when it was assembling
was such that you had one supernova

937
00:57:31,721 --> 00:57:34,090
explosion and you kind of
splattered out all the stars.

938
00:57:34,091 --> 00:57:35,230
And maybe that's why you've ended up,

939
00:57:35,231 --> 00:57:39,580
but those are the kind of the objects
that you get closest to which are nearly

940
00:57:39,581 --> 00:57:42,640
dark, but even they are not
completely dark. But, you know,

941
00:57:42,641 --> 00:57:46,540
we've been looking always in the mapping
work that I do in gravitational lensing.

942
00:57:46,820 --> 00:57:50,080
Uh, there have been claims at some point
saying, oh, we found a dark cluster.

943
00:57:50,110 --> 00:57:52,450
But then you look deeper.
There's just, they're faint.

944
00:57:52,451 --> 00:57:55,810
Galaxies are just munched and it's
just that, you know, we've missed them.

945
00:57:56,410 --> 00:57:59,230
But that would be cool
if we did find them.

946
00:57:59,350 --> 00:58:03,220
So, so does that, does
that imply like, come on,

947
00:58:03,250 --> 00:58:06,680
can we draw conclusions that, like,
if, if we think that dark mattered,

948
00:58:06,681 --> 00:58:10,420
never clumps independently
of physical matter, is there,

949
00:58:10,750 --> 00:58:14,200
is there a theory or an
explanation for that behavior?

950
00:58:14,470 --> 00:58:18,230
I know, I mean, I think it's not the dark
matter. It doesn't clump independent of,

951
00:58:18,260 --> 00:58:19,670
uh,
of Baryons,

952
00:58:19,880 --> 00:58:24,880
but that baryons always find their way
to gravitational potential wells that are

953
00:58:25,191 --> 00:58:29,930
generated by the dark matter because dark
matter really structures the universe.

954
00:58:31,170 --> 00:58:32,080
So way back when,

955
00:58:32,081 --> 00:58:35,350
there was a discussion as to whether
or not there was enough matter in the

956
00:58:35,351 --> 00:58:40,150
universe to change Friedman's equations
to being closed versus forever

957
00:58:40,151 --> 00:58:41,360
expanding.
Yup.

958
00:58:41,530 --> 00:58:46,150
Where does that discussion stands now
with what we know about dark matter?

959
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:47,050
Yes.

960
00:58:47,050 --> 00:58:50,020
Well, so what we know in 1998, uh,

961
00:58:50,140 --> 00:58:55,140
we discovered that the expansion of
the universe is actually accelerating.

962
00:58:56,200 --> 00:58:58,720
And so it's driven by,
um,

963
00:58:58,750 --> 00:59:03,750
by a force that countervails
the attraction of gravity's
a repulsive force and

964
00:59:03,910 --> 00:59:06,430
um,
that appears to be driving this.

965
00:59:06,760 --> 00:59:11,600
And the contribution of
that repulsive force to the,

966
00:59:11,630 --> 00:59:16,150
the energy density budget
of the universe was 70%.

967
00:59:16,151 --> 00:59:18,070
So it was sort of the
dominant component today.

968
00:59:18,490 --> 00:59:23,150
And so what it showed us
was that the inventory,

969
00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:24,890
the pie chart that I showed you,

970
00:59:25,080 --> 00:59:28,340
he said the dark matter is
the dominant matter component.

971
00:59:28,550 --> 00:59:31,250
But in terms of the total energy density,

972
00:59:31,251 --> 00:59:34,060
the mass energy density of the universe,
uh,

973
00:59:34,330 --> 00:59:36,260
the dominant piece is still dark energy.

974
00:59:36,261 --> 00:59:39,860
We don't quite know what
dark energy is right yet,

975
00:59:39,890 --> 00:59:43,970
except we know what it does. And as you
can see with a lot of these entities,

976
00:59:44,180 --> 00:59:48,890
we actually know what, how they effect
motions. I know measurable quantities,

977
00:59:49,130 --> 00:59:52,880
although we don't know what they are
and how they are actually in the case of

978
00:59:52,881 --> 00:59:55,730
dark matter, we know how it's
distributed. In the case of dark energy,

979
00:59:55,940 --> 00:59:58,640
we really don't know yet
whether it's a field.

980
00:59:58,641 --> 01:00:03,020
It could have been a scalar field
in the very early universe. Um, um,

981
01:00:03,080 --> 01:00:06,200
but there is no plausible
theory quite yet.

982
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:11,460
We're meant to act as you presume the dark
end Jack Energy is effectively uniform

983
01:00:12,980 --> 01:00:16,750
because otherwise it was a clumping of
dark energy. It's gravitation uniforms

984
01:00:17,640 --> 01:00:22,320
spatially as an, it is accelerate
space time in a uniform way,

985
01:00:22,440 --> 01:00:26,010
but it has come to dominate
at later times. Temporarily.

986
01:00:26,011 --> 01:00:28,140
It has come to dominate at later times.

987
01:00:28,470 --> 01:00:30,940
So there was an epoch in
the universe when, uh,

988
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:34,170
the energy density was dominated
by radiation in the early stages,

989
01:00:34,470 --> 01:00:37,740
then matter took over and mattered,
dominated mostly dark matter.

990
01:00:38,040 --> 01:00:41,910
And then at late times now dark
energy has taken over temporarily.

991
01:00:43,600 --> 01:00:47,020
Oh, I have to choose, dammit.
So they'll go for it. Okay.

992
01:00:47,060 --> 01:00:50,000
You had mentioned earlier that,
um, what different theories,

993
01:00:50,001 --> 01:00:52,220
different ideas about what
dark matter could d could be,

994
01:00:52,700 --> 01:00:55,610
have different implications for his
distribution, like you had said,

995
01:00:55,611 --> 01:00:57,560
clumpy or versus more
smoothly distributed.

996
01:00:58,430 --> 01:01:01,520
If you can describe to lay people at
all in the time we have remaining,

997
01:01:01,640 --> 01:01:05,790
what sort of parameters are
varying there that might, yeah,

998
01:01:06,080 --> 01:01:10,560
so, um, so what it is so
clumping, right? It's um, um,

999
01:01:10,730 --> 01:01:14,960
it's a substructure. It
is the structure of, um,

1000
01:01:15,410 --> 01:01:18,860
the detailed distribution,
the granularity of dark matter.

1001
01:01:19,130 --> 01:01:22,820
So you can define this
quantity called us sub halo,

1002
01:01:22,821 --> 01:01:27,470
the substructure mass function,
how much mass you have in every,

1003
01:01:27,770 --> 01:01:32,750
um, uh, how, how many sub
structures you have in any mass,

1004
01:01:32,751 --> 01:01:37,310
Ben. And that can be characterized. So
within, so within our galaxy, for example,

1005
01:01:37,311 --> 01:01:39,470
which is about 10 to the 12
times the mass of the sun,

1006
01:01:39,800 --> 01:01:43,730
the question is how many clubs there are
that are 10 to the 10 solar masses tend

1007
01:01:43,731 --> 01:01:46,010
to the nine solar masses.
That spectrum.

1008
01:01:46,011 --> 01:01:50,810
It's a power law and we think it has a
slope of minus 1.8399999999999999 cold,

1009
01:01:50,811 --> 01:01:55,430
dark matter for other kinds of dark
matter. It is not as seamless power law.

1010
01:01:55,431 --> 01:01:56,300
There's a cutoff.

1011
01:01:56,330 --> 01:02:01,190
And so we're kind of looking for a cutoff
in that power spectrum, if you will.

1012
01:02:01,370 --> 01:02:03,320
You know, these, these
fluctuations, right?

1013
01:02:03,321 --> 01:02:07,730
They're basically these dark matter
clumps arise from fluctuations in a mean

1014
01:02:07,731 --> 01:02:11,240
field very early on in the universe
that get amplified over time.

1015
01:02:11,990 --> 01:02:12,381
Okay,

1016
01:02:12,381 --> 01:02:16,550
so this isn't necessarily
about like different ways
dark matter might behave now

1017
01:02:16,690 --> 01:02:18,200
about more like an actual condition.

1018
01:02:18,370 --> 01:02:20,670
No, no, it's, it's to
the initial conditions,

1019
01:02:20,700 --> 01:02:25,700
but you see the manifestation now of how
it's actually spatially distributed and

1020
01:02:25,711 --> 01:02:28,020
what the mass function of those clumps is.

1021
01:02:30,380 --> 01:02:33,290
All right, thanks everybody. And let's
please give one last round of applause.

1022
01:02:33,740 --> 01:02:38,510
[inaudible].
