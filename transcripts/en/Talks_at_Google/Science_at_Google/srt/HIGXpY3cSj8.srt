1
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:10,410
Clapperton chuck in that some of Ungers
professional interests lie in the

2
00:00:10,411 --> 00:00:13,110
history theory and practice of science,
technology,

3
00:00:13,111 --> 00:00:17,340
innovation and entrepreneurship in the
international context with a focus on

4
00:00:17,341 --> 00:00:18,174
Africa.

5
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:24,020
He joined MIT as an assistant professor
in 2008 after completing his phd at the

6
00:00:24,151 --> 00:00:25,260
University of Michigan.

7
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:30,830
He is the author of transient workspaces
technologies of everyday innovation in

8
00:00:30,841 --> 00:00:35,700
Zimbabwe. And his second book is an edited
volume which we'll hear about today.

9
00:00:35,701 --> 00:00:39,540
Entitled what do science, Technology
and innovation mean from Africa.

10
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:42,120
Please join me in welcoming
professor [inaudible].

11
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,880
Thank you.
Uh,

12
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,210
thank you all for coming.
I would like to,

13
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:56,363
mmm,

14
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:00,300
start off by giving just a brief

15
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:04,890
background to how this project came about.

16
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:07,140
MMM.

17
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:12,860
It's a progression from my first
book, uh, transit work spaces.

18
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:18,820
And what I was trying to do in that
book was to ask this fairy important

19
00:01:19,161 --> 00:01:19,994
question.

20
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:25,600
Why is it easy that in the history of
technology science into innovation,

21
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:29,510
Africa does not seem to be on the map,

22
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:34,900
is a question that he does not have any
technology or simply that it has been

23
00:01:36,621 --> 00:01:41,000
ignored.
So as you know,

24
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:46,250
Africa is a very big continent.
54 countries,

25
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:50,540
uh,
probably plus if you include the islands.

26
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:55,700
And this is not something that you
can just, you know, cover inside,

27
00:01:56,550 --> 00:02:01,010
uh, one book on your own
in a short period of time.

28
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:06,940
So I wanted to ask this question
on a larger scale in these,

29
00:02:07,101 --> 00:02:10,900
was the birth of this book,
take a closer look at the title,

30
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:13,750
the major Eh,

31
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,220
where there is from.

32
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:22,400
The idea was to take
seriously African voices,

33
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:27,110
not just his empirical evidence
or cannon fodder for theory,

34
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:29,830
but is,
um,

35
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:32,900
intellectual agents in their own right.

36
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:36,500
What if we took what they
know seriously enough

37
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:43,600
to do that I organized
in number of scholars,

38
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:47,800
some of them mentors to me, others, uh,

39
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:52,450
colleagues at the same level.
Da, my Solo at Louisville,

40
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,320
a shattering cheery Korea
at University of Cape Town,

41
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:02,040
Sheree or Gusto at Brown Katrine
[inaudible] you live in runny egg lash,

42
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:07,630
who some of you may know it. Rpi, uh,

43
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:12,520
and then Foresta he's
student, um, totally.

44
00:03:12,521 --> 00:03:15,860
Or do Masu and got it.
Louis,

45
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:18,760
both of them at University of Virginia,

46
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:23,920
both engineers and they are colleagues.

47
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:24,783
Nasima.

48
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:30,240
So the idea was could we have a
conversation across disciplines?

49
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:32,943
Eh,

50
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:38,140
I didn't want this idea of us just
the science and technology studies,

51
00:03:39,161 --> 00:03:40,870
people speaking to ourselves.

52
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:44,650
I wanted to open up this
conversation to multiple disciplines.

53
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:49,450
The bench sciences, engineering
disciplines, lawyers.

54
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:55,110
The conference that I
organized in November 19th,

55
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:56,110
2014 was

56
00:03:57,670 --> 00:04:01,780
actually very eclectic is,
and actually it,

57
00:04:01,781 --> 00:04:06,060
this became the actual
title of the book. Uh, uh,

58
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:10,400
we haggled over this. Some of you may
know from publishing that publishers,

59
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:15,450
one is set in type of title
for marketing reasons.

60
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:19,420
I said, no, this is the title.

61
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:26,860
Like I said, there's this
persistent negative image of Africa,

62
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:32,850
but there is also the agency of some
of us working on Africa to escape it.

63
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:37,830
Other stifling, uh, Western, uh,

64
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:40,270
dependence on theory.

65
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:45,370
Could we imagine science,
technology and innovation from say,

66
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:46,990
our own languages.

67
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:49,760
Okay.

68
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,830
I look at definitions of science,

69
00:04:51,831 --> 00:04:56,510
technology and innovation today and I'm
sure you would agree that they are very

70
00:04:56,511 --> 00:05:00,770
reductionist science comes to be,

71
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:01,900
eh,

72
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:06,900
removed from a all kinds
of social dimensions.

73
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:11,240
But as we know,
science itself is a social activity.

74
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:16,900
The idea was to restore that and see
where we would get in Africa for example,

75
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:23,710
it's impossible to reckon with any major
innovation without ticking seriously

76
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:29,360
religious aspects that under good
the ritual of knowledge production.

77
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:33,230
The same for technology.
If you look at technology today,

78
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:38,800
it's as if it's just a technical gadgets.
Um,

79
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:42,200
and I'm seeing they said Google,
um,

80
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:47,180
but it's a whole complex systems,
social,

81
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:49,880
technical, cultural, etc. Etc.

82
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:53,210
My interest was to restore that,

83
00:05:53,211 --> 00:05:55,490
but all sorts of disturb
the meaning of technology.

84
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,540
Is it that obvious or
could it be something more?

85
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:05,200
Could it be that we are
in being in reducing it to
gadgets we are missing out on

86
00:06:08,031 --> 00:06:08,900
something else?

87
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:13,670
What could that something
else be the same with,

88
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:17,210
um,
if you look at innovation,

89
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:22,310
innovation has been reduced to
this very commercialized tech,

90
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:27,530
techno centric, uh, rearm. So what are we,

91
00:06:27,531 --> 00:06:32,330
what are we to do with those activities
that people engage with that fall

92
00:06:32,331 --> 00:06:35,690
outside that
now,

93
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:38,810
why did these conversations
or care when they did,

94
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:45,100
this was just a year before I got
tenure at 2015 and I was beginning to be

95
00:06:46,761 --> 00:06:51,761
frustrated by the insula way in which
academia engages with questions of the

96
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:55,750
world.
Um,

97
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:59,810
and so I began to engage policy makers.
For example,

98
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:04,880
could I see myself playing a role
making interventions in policy?

99
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:07,930
Okay.

100
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:12,930
I had been conducting research since
2008 on what I call everyday knowledge.

101
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:18,190
That knowledge that sustains
people when, uh, the,

102
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:21,850
our Nice Gary as a here,
Eh,

103
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:24,040
when people don't have those careers,

104
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:27,910
they never went to school or
if they were fired from work.

105
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:30,040
Many of these people in Africa,

106
00:07:30,041 --> 00:07:35,041
going back to what is now called
informal sector or the informal economy,

107
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:41,920
what under girds the informal activity,
uh,

108
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:45,350
these skills that you
need to go by every day.

109
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:49,150
Most of them are not in the curriculum.
In the school curriculum.

110
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:53,950
A good number of them actually dismissed,
uh,

111
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:58,980
traditionally is primitive
or simply and knowledgeable.

112
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:06,990
So I see they started this 2000 and
this project 2008 by then I had already

113
00:08:07,811 --> 00:08:11,710
began to hear this talk.
Africa is rising, Eh,

114
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:16,720
you seeing a new young African who
is quite driven to make a difference.

115
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:21,460
The,

116
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:26,520
there is one generation that still says
colonialism is to blame for all our eels

117
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:30,850
theater now that says no, no, no. We
have been independent for a while.

118
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:32,980
Could this nonsense,

119
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:38,950
this generation that I am talking about,
the younger generation,

120
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:45,030
I felt they needed a different kind of
narrative about African deeply rooted in

121
00:08:45,431 --> 00:08:49,540
history but also tackling the key,

122
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:54,040
uh, keywords in their own time. Like tech,

123
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:58,280
like science, like innovation,
like entrepreneurship.

124
00:08:59,550 --> 00:08:59,960
Okay.

125
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:04,070
And yet when you look at Africa's history
is a blank slate. Historians have you,

126
00:09:04,130 --> 00:09:07,160
not that anthropologists,
yeah,

127
00:09:07,161 --> 00:09:11,960
they are beginning to come round to it
is for engineering, science and tech.

128
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:13,280
They don't deal with that stuff.

129
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:14,820
Okay.

130
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:19,820
So each nation subsists on
its own meats and to heroes.

131
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:24,250
What kind of euros with
this generation subsystem.

132
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:26,753
Okay.

133
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:31,450
That's the busiest for,
I'm writing this book.

134
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:36,160
It was intended for what?
Since the book was published.

135
00:09:36,161 --> 00:09:38,710
He has now, uh, image,

136
00:09:38,711 --> 00:09:43,711
the clearly in my mind is a project
of training critical thinkers.

137
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:46,013
Doers.

138
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:47,500
Okay.

139
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:51,490
In other words is to see that Africa
is a load of critical thinkers,

140
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:54,490
but most of them are not.

141
00:09:54,491 --> 00:09:59,491
Do us and those that actually do
things are not critical thinkers.

142
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:04,090
So how do you bring these
two and square the circle.

143
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:07,440
Okay.

144
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,280
The research that I had done
since both during and since Phd,

145
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:16,580
he had taught me that the best way to be
effective in the world is to be humble

146
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:24,560
before knowledge to not appear like you
monopolize the space of common sense and

147
00:10:26,071 --> 00:10:26,904
reason.

148
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:28,730
Yeah.

149
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:32,600
And that was coming from
being at MIT is in academic.

150
00:10:33,410 --> 00:10:38,410
And what I learnt in my fieldwork and
through growing up was a lot of knowledge

151
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:45,170
that is handed down from generation
to generation through practice.

152
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:46,730
Okay.

153
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:51,730
And part of this required me to have
to really look at Africa in a different

154
00:10:52,761 --> 00:10:57,500
light is somebody was coming
back from years in the diaspora.

155
00:10:59,080 --> 00:10:59,680
Okay.

156
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:03,520
I found that one of the most
underestimated strengths,

157
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:05,380
the most underrated,
eh,

158
00:11:05,650 --> 00:11:10,180
acids of Africa is what one
would call creative resilience.

159
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:14,230
Where even when people's
backs are against the wall,

160
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:18,640
they don't just die, roll over
and die. They die fighting.

161
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:24,750
And so that creative spirits
is often take ignored.

162
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:29,680
People just talk about,
oh Africa's people are very resilient.

163
00:11:29,681 --> 00:11:31,060
Look at what is thrown at them.

164
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:33,000
Okay.

165
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,630
No, it's not just the
resilience, it's also creativity.

166
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,390
You can be resilient or all you want,

167
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:43,770
but if you are faced with hunger in death,

168
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,180
you have to innovate.

169
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:47,260
Okay.

170
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:51,790
The concern for me was that a lot
of what is what we are seeing now,

171
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:52,720
uh,

172
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:57,720
in the context in terms of innovation
arises out of trying to make due to deal

173
00:11:59,891 --> 00:12:02,110
with a very tough situation.

174
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:09,830
So let me take you through the individual
chapters in the process of answering

175
00:12:12,751 --> 00:12:16,920
this question. What do science, technology
and innovation mean from Africa?

176
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:20,230
I have seen that I held him,
Eh,

177
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:25,290
W I convened a meeting at Mit in 2014 I
had also organized the previous one in

178
00:12:28,801 --> 00:12:32,490
South Africa to recast
the idea of laboratory.

179
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:34,620
Okay.

180
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:36,180
Why recast it?

181
00:12:36,210 --> 00:12:41,210
Because I don't believe that the built
laboratory is the only laboratory that

182
00:12:43,441 --> 00:12:46,170
exists.
If we limited to that,

183
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,460
we are shutting out the
door a lot of possibilities.

184
00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:53,530
Okay.

185
00:12:53,530 --> 00:12:56,830
Now where would you start with this?

186
00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:01,960
The first port of call for me
was could we engage philosophers?

187
00:13:01,961 --> 00:13:06,961
We have been dealing with a lot of these
questions about African knowledge and

188
00:13:08,411 --> 00:13:12,280
so in the chapter that
Di da Macello rights,

189
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:15,610
it's a very interesting
example from Egypt.

190
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:21,990
The concern for the afterlife in
how it give rise to the science of

191
00:13:22,931 --> 00:13:23,764
magnification.

192
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:26,350
Okay.

193
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:30,970
And this discovery of [inaudible],
which was used to preserve the body.

194
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:33,490
And one of the theories,

195
00:13:33,491 --> 00:13:38,491
the advances is that this was the
rationale for turning to not Ron in

196
00:13:41,801 --> 00:13:42,521
mummifying,

197
00:13:42,521 --> 00:13:47,521
a body or a preserving it in a fridge
state was saw that it could travel the

198
00:13:49,601 --> 00:13:54,601
journey to the afterlife in a fresh
state in instead of arriving the in a de

199
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:57,003
composting.

200
00:13:58,720 --> 00:13:59,270
Okay.

201
00:13:59,270 --> 00:13:59,870
Now,

202
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:04,640
however we may think about the belief
systems of the ancient Egyptians is not

203
00:14:04,641 --> 00:14:05,474
the question here.

204
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:07,660
Okay.

205
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:11,680
Usually in the past, African knowledge
has been dismissed. Oh, this is cuckoo.

206
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:12,640
That can't happen.

207
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:15,793
Okay.

208
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:20,080
And yet when you look at
the science that follows,

209
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:26,260
we surely that's what we just take and
say, okay, this is what we hold on to.

210
00:14:26,261 --> 00:14:28,180
The rest is rubbish.

211
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:34,710
Muscle also touches on what is often
conceived of as a primitive society in

212
00:14:37,931 --> 00:14:42,931
trying to find technology
and innovation in that space.

213
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:49,200
The Messiah of Kenya and buy other parts
of East Africa and how they have been

214
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:56,260
to both maintain salient aspects
of designing spears is will is

215
00:14:58,610 --> 00:15:02,750
adopting and adapting some
elements that are coming in.

216
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:07,820
In my own chapter I focused on

217
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:10,730
something different.

218
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:17,620
I wanted to see if we can really think
about science from a truly indigenous

219
00:15:18,561 --> 00:15:22,790
language
and if we did that,

220
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:25,910
what kind of keywords
might we come up with

221
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:31,640
and what I found was quite interesting

222
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:34,083
in

223
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:37,410
several parts of the of the chapter,

224
00:15:37,411 --> 00:15:42,411
I give the example of the way in which
observations of animals and animal

225
00:15:43,291 --> 00:15:44,124
science

226
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:50,360
give rise to a whole way
of defending agonist,

227
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:53,610
enemy attack in constructing
defense systems.

228
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:58,440
My best is mice is a rule.

229
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:01,650
Mice always have a plan B.

230
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:07,620
When they dig they have two exits.
One is the obvious one.

231
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:12,450
The other is the other you don't see,
so they enter this way.

232
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,960
If you wait here and think that the
mouse is going to come back this way

233
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:17,883
and

234
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:23,640
you are already poised to hit it,
oops,

235
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:28,080
it has already bolted the other
way it's gone. When he digs,

236
00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:33,000
there are all these
various covens that it,

237
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:35,490
it it highs in,

238
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:41,070
so you may be digging this way and it
takes a detour and just highs there.

239
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:43,050
Okay.

240
00:16:43,050 --> 00:16:47,970
Mice are also known to be very good
at defending against siege warfare.

241
00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:51,930
One example,
I give the these,

242
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:55,980
these tick and squirrels do this as well,

243
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,070
but in this case it was mice.

244
00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:00,680
Okay.

245
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:04,550
And this had very substantial
consequences to the concept of Chimeranga.

246
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:10,420
The idea that women would be stalking
food in the caves while all the men who

247
00:17:11,791 --> 00:17:14,630
would be busy mounting the defenses.

248
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,420
It was a communal effort.

249
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:20,400
Yeah.

250
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:25,400
What I'm interested is not so much the
the war I tend to be until I am much more

251
00:17:26,641 --> 00:17:31,641
interested in the idea that you could
learn a lot of things from other animals

252
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:37,470
and I'm sure if you look at some of
the science that that's coming out,

253
00:17:37,471 --> 00:17:38,790
like get skin for example.

254
00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:45,050
It's coming out of this idea to learn the
animal world in order for you to apply

255
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:50,880
to other papers is full
shattered to query.

256
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:57,170
The interesting thing was to think about
the laboratory is a site which is not

257
00:17:57,211 --> 00:18:01,230
fixed or ticket to space.
It's something that is moving.

258
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:06,720
You can lift it and press it way.
What remains constant is the practice.

259
00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:10,110
And for these example this,

260
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:15,120
this is a stunning example of how
you could actually build furnaces,

261
00:18:15,121 --> 00:18:18,600
blast furnaces in clay
in order to smelt iron.

262
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:20,090
Okay.

263
00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:25,090
And do so in a way that is capable
of being shifted elsewhere.

264
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:27,760
Okay.

265
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:32,760
And I'm calling this science because how
else do you explain the fact that these

266
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:38,470
ironsmiths on the Zimbabwean plateau in
Congo in the 16th to 18th centuries they

267
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:42,940
out competed the Portuguese,

268
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,960
we had come with their engineers
from Europe to construct foundries.

269
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:48,860
Okay.

270
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:53,310
And the Portuguese, Lo and behold they
couldn't Benatar. They'll hold the lock.

271
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:57,740
Our market, in fact they did not
even have confidence in their own.

272
00:18:58,760 --> 00:18:59,210
Yeah.

273
00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:04,210
Iron and then they deferred to this
locums in order to continue to be viable.

274
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:08,460
Okay.

275
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:13,460
Part of what I find interesting is the
way in which these ironsmiths we're able

276
00:19:13,771 --> 00:19:16,050
to manipulate air supply.

277
00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:18,340
Okay.

278
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:23,340
To initiate combustion and control it
to know what kind of trees were required

279
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:28,630
to provide wooed with goods,

280
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:33,960
charcoal and to be able to do so in such
a way that they prepare the charcoal

281
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:36,940
under specific conditions.

282
00:19:39,810 --> 00:19:40,500
Okay.

283
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:45,180
That's science.
There is no way we can go around it.

284
00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:46,860
That's science.

285
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:53,890
So I am working as one of the
two activities that she recorded.

286
00:19:54,361 --> 00:19:57,920
It looks at the other one is Porterie.

287
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:03,050
Porter is interesting because
it's practiced by women,

288
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:08,420
mostly women in Africa. I've not heard
of societies where men are to be found,

289
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,710
you know, making pots. No.

290
00:20:10,711 --> 00:20:13,580
If I had of until perhaps the,

291
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:17,900
the recent times of any
women smelting iron,

292
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:22,130
both we're governed by taboos.

293
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:27,940
If a woman comes near
anywhere near the finish,

294
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:32,210
the,
I don't know,

295
00:20:32,211 --> 00:20:37,211
not come out nicely and the same time
if a men came anywhere near where women

296
00:20:42,471 --> 00:20:45,920
were making pots,
they would crack.

297
00:20:47,290 --> 00:20:48,310
That was the taboo.

298
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:54,910
Production could only take place
under these specific conditions.

299
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:59,020
Nothing else.
And before anything was done,

300
00:20:59,530 --> 00:21:04,530
these folks had to go before
their ancestors and the gurus of,

301
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:09,880
of, of technology. If you want to
see this is what we are going to do.

302
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:12,253
Okay.

303
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:16,700
If anything failed they would
blame the failure to observe taboo.

304
00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:21,120
Taboo may sound strange,
doesn't it?

305
00:21:22,170 --> 00:21:27,170
It's nothing more than the kinds
of things that you do in science.

306
00:21:27,481 --> 00:21:32,481
Science is its own taboos here the do's
and don'ts under which an experiment is

307
00:21:33,931 --> 00:21:34,764
carried out.

308
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:38,990
Okay.

309
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:43,990
We often think of innovation is something
that we all are free to and if you

310
00:21:47,571 --> 00:21:49,490
look at the narrative of innovation,

311
00:21:50,030 --> 00:21:55,030
it is usually this independent
spirit of creativity and risk taking,

312
00:21:56,690 --> 00:22:00,320
particularly by the o think slavery.

313
00:22:01,370 --> 00:22:04,490
How do you innovate Eh,

314
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:10,150
freedom or how do you innovate survivor
or alive under bondage when your life

315
00:22:15,351 --> 00:22:19,850
has been reduced to nothing more than
a machine of mass production on the

316
00:22:19,851 --> 00:22:24,830
plantation. That's the focus
of of urea or gastro stopped.

317
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:30,340
She is trying to reposition the Trans
Atlantic trade in Africans is leaves,

318
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,310
I don't call it slave trick.

319
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:36,840
Okay.

320
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:41,430
Is it technology transfer
and innovation process?

321
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:47,480
The argument she's making through seeds
and medicines is an interesting one that

322
00:22:49,290 --> 00:22:52,980
it's easy to say they were
carriers of ready made

323
00:22:54,810 --> 00:22:58,260
products from Africa or knowledge
in their heads from Africa.

324
00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:03,270
That's easy to say,
eh?

325
00:23:03,570 --> 00:23:07,300
Some scholars have said that
for ice, others, for Mass Henri,

326
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:11,590
others for mentors,
the work of kindness,

327
00:23:11,591 --> 00:23:12,600
Gaucho for example,

328
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:19,640
but what she's saying is that in that
space between departure and arrival,

329
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:24,510
enslaved Africans hit to survive.

330
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:30,260
The only way you survive was to
keep yourself with high morale.

331
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:35,280
Of course there was also the possibility
that you could recruit yourself from

332
00:23:35,281 --> 00:23:40,281
the space of being molested by your
character and just jump over Borden ended

333
00:23:42,150 --> 00:23:45,630
and denied them profit.
Yeah.

334
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:51,080
That way still very creative
and a difficulty comes in
system or you could take

335
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:56,210
only those,
those resources that you had,

336
00:23:57,020 --> 00:24:01,580
there was nothing else to
work with and shift them,

337
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:02,240
inform,

338
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:06,950
transform them in order
to create something that
would enable you to survive.

339
00:24:08,570 --> 00:24:10,370
So the space between

340
00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:14,990
departure and arrival
was not a dead space.

341
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:17,900
It was a creative space,

342
00:24:19,490 --> 00:24:22,100
what she calls the Inter Trans,

343
00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:26,810
the in between at the same
time when they arrived.

344
00:24:26,990 --> 00:24:31,220
Picture yourself arriving in a foreign
environment where you have to eek out a

345
00:24:31,221 --> 00:24:33,380
living even as you are enslaved.

346
00:24:36,530 --> 00:24:37,360
Okay.

347
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:42,360
What she is calling attention to is
to look at the slave quarters is an

348
00:24:43,631 --> 00:24:45,100
innovation space.

349
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:49,970
Okay.

350
00:24:49,970 --> 00:24:54,970
I liked this picture because partly
tills biography of me growing up

351
00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:03,410
where a lot of things were not,

352
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:06,050
did not have space locally we,

353
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:11,260
it was during sanctions and I saw the
Rhodesian community innovating in very

354
00:25:14,151 --> 00:25:15,200
interesting ways,

355
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:21,100
replacing imported parts with local ones
that they could easily manufacture and

356
00:25:22,911 --> 00:25:27,911
when they ran their life they actually
began to manufacture them locally.

357
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Examples include a lot of the Humvees
that you see in the battlefields in the

358
00:25:38,210 --> 00:25:40,220
Middle East that are
coming from Australia.

359
00:25:40,850 --> 00:25:45,850
Much of that r and d was Rhodesian met
these auditions then migrated after

360
00:25:46,341 --> 00:25:50,390
independence. They did not want to have
to be ruled by a blood governments.

361
00:25:50,391 --> 00:25:54,140
They migrated.
That's one narrative.

362
00:25:55,070 --> 00:25:57,020
The other narrative
that's interesting is that

363
00:25:58,940 --> 00:25:59,560
okay,

364
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:02,860
if you wanted your mom
to cook food for you,

365
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:07,690
you had to make the utensils
and it started to process it.

366
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:10,490
Okay.

367
00:26:10,490 --> 00:26:14,060
In precolonial Africa for example,
they will know hammer mills,

368
00:26:14,090 --> 00:26:16,490
they will know steam machines.

369
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:19,130
The only way you could bow,

370
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:24,160
you could grind grain and produce
meal was to produce mortar and pestle.

371
00:26:25,790 --> 00:26:30,790
And what you see in this picture is a
process it dad taking his son through the

372
00:26:31,761 --> 00:26:36,200
process of how you make one
and to the point until you,

373
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:41,150
your mother actually pounds
a grain to make food for you.

374
00:26:42,990 --> 00:26:47,340
At Mit we talk of mind in hint,
this is his mind and hinders.

375
00:26:47,370 --> 00:26:50,790
You can get the subject of

376
00:26:53,010 --> 00:26:58,010
total or the Moses chapter
is an interesting one
because you are hearing more

377
00:27:00,391 --> 00:27:05,220
and more. Now Africa being
referred to is leap frogging.

378
00:27:06,930 --> 00:27:11,290
For most of Africa there
was no land fixed land line

379
00:27:12,930 --> 00:27:17,610
then comes cyber,
which by the way did not come.

380
00:27:17,930 --> 00:27:22,110
Cell phones did. They did not
come just by the grace of God.

381
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:27,450
Norway, they brought by
foreigners. The first,

382
00:27:27,451 --> 00:27:30,960
the pioneers of cell phones in Africa,

383
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:35,460
so phone or broads
cylinder foreign to Africa.

384
00:27:36,810 --> 00:27:37,540
Okay

385
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:39,280
included people like me,
worldwide tare,

386
00:27:40,570 --> 00:27:44,680
Eh ou founded at telesales

387
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:48,910
for us to have

388
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:54,680
undersea cables.
That Sitcom navigated the Cape.

389
00:27:55,850 --> 00:28:00,600
That idea was pushed very vociferously
by former South African prison.

390
00:28:00,601 --> 00:28:03,380
Didn't tableau ambig
his argument was simple.

391
00:28:04,370 --> 00:28:09,370
There was one slot reserved for hosting
the World Cup for 2010 and it would go

392
00:28:11,721 --> 00:28:15,650
to an African country. No.
Which guns would it be?

393
00:28:16,010 --> 00:28:18,410
Would it be Egypt,
Egypt, last two funnels.

394
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:23,570
In any case it was almost right on the
path of the undersea cables going to

395
00:28:23,571 --> 00:28:28,160
India.
The argument doesn't make,

396
00:28:28,161 --> 00:28:33,020
he was making was interesting.
If Egypt gets the World Cup,

397
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:38,590
I forgot it's lost its
chance to have is a,

398
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:43,540
you know
Internet each way.

399
00:28:43,550 --> 00:28:48,550
It is lost as jazz so the only way it's
getting heavy it is if the cop came to

400
00:28:48,651 --> 00:28:53,300
South Africa, we now know that if you look
at the map, the site by map of Africa,

401
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:58,940
that is come to be,
it come to pass.

402
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:03,710
Since then we have seen
interesting developments.

403
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:09,340
We have seen innovations in mobile money
with empaysah which is revolutionizing

404
00:29:10,281 --> 00:29:14,840
not just African, Eh, Eh,
how African's movement.

405
00:29:15,730 --> 00:29:20,630
It's the revolutionizing the way the
whole world does mobile banking and so

406
00:29:20,631 --> 00:29:21,464
forth.

407
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:26,390
The latest innovation is by
ziplining international in Rwanda.

408
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:31,740
A partnership that is resulted in the
supply of blood to difficult to reach

409
00:29:34,521 --> 00:29:38,780
countries using drones and by uh,
and,

410
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:42,430
and these is now expanding into Tanzania.

411
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:49,830
These things have policy implications.
For example,

412
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:56,000
how can his sensibility of Africa is
the center of technology sheep policy.

413
00:29:59,000 --> 00:29:59,833
Yeah.

414
00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:03,940
And part of the reason
why we produced this

415
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:11,520
volume when we did is because we were
concerned that the strategic plan for

416
00:30:13,661 --> 00:30:15,760
Africa,
the science,

417
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:20,820
technology and innovation strategy
for Africa focus is on big science and

418
00:30:23,801 --> 00:30:28,801
national systems of innovation derived
from mostly European countries.

419
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:33,490
Wu's uh, economies, um,

420
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:38,440
science intensive. They are
research intensive. By contrast,

421
00:30:39,010 --> 00:30:42,490
70% of Africa's economy is generated,
you know,

422
00:30:42,491 --> 00:30:47,491
the informal sector produced by that
everyday knowledge that I highlighted

423
00:30:48,941 --> 00:30:49,774
earlier.
One.

424
00:30:52,210 --> 00:30:54,370
So part of what Chuck's done it was does,

425
00:30:54,730 --> 00:30:58,180
is to try and retain us to it.

426
00:30:58,250 --> 00:31:00,460
That kind of conversation.

427
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:05,940
Can we have something more sophisticated
than just cutting and pasting in

428
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:11,080
closing, I've talked so
far about a, what we did,

429
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:15,340
this is what has happened since

430
00:31:19,270 --> 00:31:24,270
the impeditive now is to transform
some of these findings into actual

431
00:31:25,571 --> 00:31:26,404
curriculum.

432
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:31,360
So we have been turning
the networks that we,

433
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:37,160
we built through this process into
silver by like this for example,

434
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:43,060
how about we take students
to these sites like this uh,

435
00:31:43,061 --> 00:31:48,061
forge here and taking seriously
the science involved in
this and combine it with

436
00:31:51,041 --> 00:31:53,170
engineering.
What might we get?

437
00:31:55,910 --> 00:32:00,410
How about we take knowledge of
grain storage under which um,

438
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:05,500
Africans Dogg underground or constructed
structures made of clay and he did them

439
00:32:11,090 --> 00:32:15,480
and after heating and it's cool they,
they,

440
00:32:15,570 --> 00:32:20,570
they put grain insight and then seal
it thereby ensuring that no weevils

441
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:25,610
getting,
what are we need to make up of that

442
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:32,570
is opposed to using all these
toxic pesticides to preserve gray.

443
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:37,853
Okay.

444
00:32:38,010 --> 00:32:40,100
Finally I will say that
one of the things that I've

445
00:32:40,490 --> 00:32:44,600
been trying to do is to demystify
the purpose of education.

446
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:47,480
And this is an admitted
that is dear to my heart.

447
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:52,220
When we are educated,

448
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:56,900
we leave the villages with
the communities and go abroad.

449
00:32:56,901 --> 00:33:01,901
We never come back and many of
these insights as good as they were,

450
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:07,580
they were produced by
academics and these academics.

451
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:12,860
What do we do?
Does it just end in talk?

452
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:18,200
I said earlier that Africa
is a huge deficits of doers,

453
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:22,610
a lot of critical thinkers.
We're not do us a lot of doers.

454
00:33:22,611 --> 00:33:23,750
We're not critical thinkers.

455
00:33:25,190 --> 00:33:30,190
The challenge personally was what have
I ever done because I want to change the

456
00:33:31,281 --> 00:33:33,620
whole of Africa.
I want to change the world.

457
00:33:33,850 --> 00:33:36,650
What if I ever really done
for my own little village?

458
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:41,840
And so I wanted to challenge fill
academics who come from Africa to say,

459
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:47,360
can't we be catalysts and builders?
So I returned to home,

460
00:33:47,870 --> 00:33:52,870
remodeled my own homestead into a kind
of laboratory where I could try out if I

461
00:33:56,121 --> 00:33:58,220
had ideas that I thought worked,

462
00:33:58,820 --> 00:34:03,230
why not try the about face to see if
they work before I can propose them to

463
00:34:03,231 --> 00:34:07,310
governments.
I can just talk from,

464
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:11,900
that's empty rhetoric.
Okay.

465
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:16,130
And as you spend substantial
presence in the village,

466
00:34:16,131 --> 00:34:21,131
you realize that actually people
where they work every day,

467
00:34:22,730 --> 00:34:24,470
these are their own laboratories.

468
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:29,860
Like this young man here who told me
that if you want to see if one fertilizer

469
00:34:30,530 --> 00:34:34,640
works amount three of them
just to plant three crops,

470
00:34:35,930 --> 00:34:38,840
right? Three plants,
right? One, two, three.

471
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:42,650
And then put the same amount
of fertilizer on each.

472
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:45,000
Okay,

473
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,250
three different.
The one that grows more

474
00:34:49,250 --> 00:34:52,320
is justified itself is the better option

475
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:59,760
so you could come to that
space is a learner and not
just somebody who's telling

476
00:34:59,831 --> 00:35:02,260
people what to do.
Finally,

477
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:08,640
there is a concept that I talk about in
the introduction coach an under which

478
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:14,640
this society came together
to do communal work,

479
00:35:14,951 --> 00:35:15,910
the whole village

480
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:22,620
to do community work for women who are
widowed for orphans or those that were

481
00:35:25,121 --> 00:35:30,121
too old to do work or simply for those
that had excelled and go to overwhelmed

482
00:35:33,130 --> 00:35:37,090
by their own crop production.
It's called Nimby.

483
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:42,420
It's an ethos of collective work.

484
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:46,050
The idea that I was bringing back was,

485
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:51,540
can't we do this again but this time
focusing on self development in the

486
00:35:52,081 --> 00:35:56,160
village, the picture, you'll
see what's ticking this morning.

487
00:35:58,250 --> 00:35:59,600
Ets,
it peaked ya off.

488
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:04,080
US electrifying our own
village using that concept.

489
00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:06,330
It's not easy.

490
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:11,840
There will be people who are still very
individualistic but you just didn't out.

491
00:36:12,391 --> 00:36:16,650
Once you cut off the rough edges,
it has turned out to be a very,

492
00:36:16,651 --> 00:36:18,810
very successful model.

493
00:36:21,150 --> 00:36:23,310
Thank you very much for listening.

494
00:36:29,550 --> 00:36:30,383
Okay.

495
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:34,430
You reminded me of an,
excuse me,

496
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:40,040
an experience I had recently
with the community garden. Um,

497
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:42,800
it is, uh, near here.

498
00:36:42,801 --> 00:36:45,740
It is not individual plots
where people in the community,

499
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:50,750
it has done communally as a group and
many of the people in that maybe be most

500
00:36:52,971 --> 00:36:57,830
in that group are engineers and
a lot of the engineers from MIT.

501
00:36:58,250 --> 00:36:59,120
And uh,

502
00:36:59,210 --> 00:37:04,100
I learned from there that farmers in the
u s at least in the western world don't

503
00:37:04,101 --> 00:37:04,934
innovate.

504
00:37:05,330 --> 00:37:06,163
Hmm.

505
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:11,220
The industry of selling them
products does the development,

506
00:37:12,041 --> 00:37:16,720
the innovation and sells them
answers to their questions basically.

507
00:37:17,030 --> 00:37:20,200
Um, so they don't ask
questions at all of themselves,

508
00:37:20,201 --> 00:37:25,201
but clearly in a village you get this
sense of being not just empowered but,

509
00:37:25,750 --> 00:37:30,520
but required to ask an answer your own
questions or they will never be known.

510
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:31,953
Um,

511
00:37:32,590 --> 00:37:36,460
it seems a natural thing for
a village environment or a,

512
00:37:37,570 --> 00:37:38,403
um,

513
00:37:38,470 --> 00:37:43,090
a group large enough to be able to
differentiate who is doing what work,

514
00:37:43,510 --> 00:37:47,980
but small enough that everyone is an
individual and everyone can hear what one

515
00:37:47,981 --> 00:37:52,330
person has to say to, to do
that kind of innovation, um,

516
00:37:52,390 --> 00:37:57,390
to learn perhaps that one other kinds
of one kind of tree blocks the wind a

517
00:37:58,661 --> 00:38:03,080
better when the wind is
making it difficult for
young, young plants. Yeah. Um,

518
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:05,200
so thank you for bringing that to light,

519
00:38:05,230 --> 00:38:08,500
but very much clicked with me
based on my personal experience.

520
00:38:08,970 --> 00:38:09,803
Thank you so much.

521
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:12,000
I'm curious if,

522
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:16,590
if you see one particular nation in
Africa or a particular city or region,

523
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:17,340
um,

524
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:22,340
as the most likely to sort of export
the next world changing technology or,

525
00:38:23,191 --> 00:38:26,100
or if that doesn't really
matter so much and if,

526
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:29,980
if you're more focused on some of the
work you've shared today that really has

527
00:38:29,981 --> 00:38:32,130
low direct local impact in communities,

528
00:38:32,730 --> 00:38:34,980
Rwanda,
Rwanda.

529
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:39,280
Because if you look at what a
President Paul, I mean, is doing,

530
00:38:39,910 --> 00:38:44,770
he's willing to take risks.
I was very impressed by the story that,

531
00:38:44,771 --> 00:38:46,540
Eh, the, Eh,

532
00:38:46,570 --> 00:38:51,140
killer Rinaldo from Ziploc and told me
he was saying that everybody else, yes.

533
00:38:51,290 --> 00:38:55,660
Laughter. Boff basic
garden even, you know,

534
00:38:55,690 --> 00:38:59,930
the big pharmaceutical companies,
uh,

535
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:04,780
the big foundations in the United
States, uh, let alone government,

536
00:39:04,781 --> 00:39:07,030
they just said, yeah, crazy
little boy get out of here.

537
00:39:08,530 --> 00:39:13,530
But [inaudible] was prepared to take
the risk and they buy loaded that the

538
00:39:17,861 --> 00:39:19,990
first,
it's a world's first actually.

539
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:25,640
So that'll needs on what's happening is
very interesting where you already have

540
00:39:25,641 --> 00:39:29,830
done better.
So that to see nothing awful shade.

541
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:32,260
Now one could say,
oh,

542
00:39:32,261 --> 00:39:37,261
but these people are coming from outside
or the big corporations in the kids

543
00:39:37,810 --> 00:39:39,220
that are doing this.

544
00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:44,250
But why is it that it's possible in Africa
and what kind of infrastructures are

545
00:39:46,511 --> 00:39:49,720
they creating?
Zip Line is very interesting.

546
00:39:49,990 --> 00:39:53,740
Where it goes next will be critical.

547
00:39:55,300 --> 00:40:00,070
So I would say Wanda,
without any doubt. Second do,

548
00:40:00,090 --> 00:40:02,240
which would be malicious.
Uh,

549
00:40:02,710 --> 00:40:07,480
I think the big innovation will
be in problem solving. Education.

550
00:40:08,130 --> 00:40:10,600
Uh,
you have two institutions.

551
00:40:10,601 --> 00:40:15,040
One in Maritia scald
African leadership academy.

552
00:40:15,041 --> 00:40:19,180
They now university. Um, and they uh,

553
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:24,420
modeling their education
system is declaring you
declare a student declares not

554
00:40:29,290 --> 00:40:31,390
a major but emission

555
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:36,580
and one of their missions is
to solve global challenges.

556
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:42,820
I she had seen in Ghana is doing the
same thing I think differently though,

557
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:46,570
but I would watch the one in Mauritius.

558
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:50,030
I work on education initiatives at Google.

559
00:40:50,031 --> 00:40:53,960
I was wondering if you could provide
a little bit more specific information

560
00:40:53,961 --> 00:40:58,490
about those examples that
you just mentioned where
there are these educational

561
00:40:58,491 --> 00:41:01,460
models around mission,
right.

562
00:41:01,490 --> 00:41:04,730
Rather than knowledge for
the sake of knowledge.

563
00:41:05,330 --> 00:41:07,700
Where can I go and learn
more information about that?

564
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:12,950
Um, they, so the thing with with,

565
00:41:12,951 --> 00:41:17,951
with upper leadership university is
that there is a big vision and they have

566
00:41:19,191 --> 00:41:24,191
started that journey to get there and
they are on a big recruitment drive.

567
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:29,060
That's how I go to know that in
the interest of full disclosure,

568
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:33,080
what interests me about them is
that they are willing to gamble,

569
00:41:33,350 --> 00:41:36,920
take big risks and start
entirely something new.

570
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:42,520
They are not interested in settled
waters because you know when the water is

571
00:41:44,481 --> 00:41:47,180
crystal create,
you will see where the crocodile is.

572
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:52,760
They are prepared to plunge in and gamble
that the crocodiles will see that they

573
00:41:52,851 --> 00:41:57,450
are too brave. They must be
banking on something and back off.

574
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:03,650
So their website is a good start,
but they are very approachable.

575
00:42:03,651 --> 00:42:08,210
In terms of Fred, you got this founder
himself is very, very approachable.

576
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:13,280
They are mixing this corporate
style of doing things with,

577
00:42:14,030 --> 00:42:16,910
I can't say traditional way
of delivering education,

578
00:42:17,330 --> 00:42:22,330
but that's that corporate style is
interesting because when he has a vision,

579
00:42:22,341 --> 00:42:26,840
he can push it forward.
Please join me again and thank you,

580
00:42:26,841 --> 00:42:30,500
professor Malanga.
Thank you so much.
