1
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:12,780
Get cleo. Thank you Keith. Justin,

2
00:00:12,781 --> 00:00:17,070
everybody has been instrumental in getting
the out here up from sunny southern

3
00:00:17,071 --> 00:00:20,400
California in San Diego.
That's a true pleasure to be here.

4
00:00:20,401 --> 00:00:25,401
And I'm interested in sharing some ideas
with you that I've had for a couple of

5
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,700
years now, but really came into
sharp focus just just about, uh,

6
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:33,030
three or four years ago when we made a
discovery that made front page headlines

7
00:00:33,031 --> 00:00:38,031
around the world and it was done in such
a way as to captivate the attention of

8
00:00:38,071 --> 00:00:40,920
people, young and old, uh, you
know, of all, all different,

9
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:45,870
all different nationalities because what
it spoke to was how did the universe

10
00:00:45,871 --> 00:00:48,090
come to be the way that we see it today?

11
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:52,890
And I'm going to talk to you about that
and the concomitant intertwining with

12
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:57,210
this most prestigious of all accolades
on earth, namely the Nobel prize.

13
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:00,960
And I came to encounter it and
obviously, you know, spoiler alert,

14
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:04,630
I did not win the Nobel prize. This
is not real, this one over here. Uh,

15
00:01:04,770 --> 00:01:08,190
but it's edible or not.
Sometimes you know, sometimes
that's even more preferable.

16
00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:12,810
You want to talk to you about how we came
to make this discovery and sort of the

17
00:01:12,811 --> 00:01:15,660
summary of the book can be shown
and, and just one, one picture,

18
00:01:15,661 --> 00:01:17,250
as most things can be described,

19
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:20,670
there's a picture made in nature
magazine and on the occasion of my a book

20
00:01:20,671 --> 00:01:24,750
release and it shows a telescope are
our neighbor telescope at the South Pole

21
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:29,640
staring up to the heavens and fixated
and focused in some sense on the Nobel

22
00:01:29,641 --> 00:01:31,090
prize. That's a picture of our, uh,

23
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:35,370
the famous Nobel prize rendered as if
it is the s this type of heat that I

24
00:01:35,371 --> 00:01:38,550
studied that I will talk to you about
today called the cosmic microwave

25
00:01:38,551 --> 00:01:41,670
background radiation,
the oldest light in the universe.

26
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,600
But before we get into the pursuit of
the Nobel Prize and the ultimate, uh, uh,

27
00:01:45,601 --> 00:01:49,080
the loss of,
of winning Alfred's namesake medallion,

28
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:53,730
I want to explore a little bit of how
the Nobel Prize came to be so venerated,

29
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:57,150
so esteemed that it really dominates
headlines around the world.

30
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:58,740
And I can't really,
you know,

31
00:01:58,741 --> 00:02:03,210
thank the media enough because right now
the Nobel prize and our fearless leader,

32
00:02:03,211 --> 00:02:08,000
Donald Trump, our air are in the news
almost on an hourly basis. So we'll,

33
00:02:08,001 --> 00:02:11,250
we'll get to that towards the very end
when I talk about some ideas that I'm

34
00:02:11,251 --> 00:02:15,510
proposing my book and arguments I
make for a modification to a society's

35
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:20,520
superlative prize. So how did the
Nobel prize get to be so esteem? Well,

36
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,650
first, a brief history of the Nobel prize.
So the history is that Alfred Nobel,

37
00:02:24,651 --> 00:02:29,400
his family and his father
were great inventors and
they were inventors of deadly

38
00:02:29,401 --> 00:02:33,990
technologies in particular. They invented
landmines and see mines, uh, during the,

39
00:02:33,991 --> 00:02:37,150
uh, one of the Russian wars
in the mid 18 hundreds. Uh,

40
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:40,890
at some point czar Nicholas decided
that they were done with war in Russia.

41
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:43,610
And you know, that came to be true,
right? There are no more wars.

42
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:45,930
The Russia after the 1860s. Right? So,

43
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,010
but they cut all the ties to the
Nobel F and F and son's business,

44
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:53,700
which we're making these deadly munitions.
And that kind of drove the older,

45
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:56,550
the father,
elder Nobel Emmanuel Nobel crazy.

46
00:02:56,850 --> 00:03:00,880
And he ended up seating control of his
business. His to his oldest son, Ludvig.

47
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,060
In between there was a huge boom,

48
00:03:04,061 --> 00:03:06,760
a building boom in the west in
particular in the United States.

49
00:03:06,761 --> 00:03:10,300
We were building railways, expanding them
from the east coast to the west coast.

50
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:12,370
And at that time they needed to do,

51
00:03:12,371 --> 00:03:15,820
they needed some way of mass excavation
and they were using Nitroglycerin,

52
00:03:15,821 --> 00:03:18,040
which is incredibly unstable.
And in fact,

53
00:03:18,041 --> 00:03:21,040
if you take nitroglycerin and you drop it,
it will explode.

54
00:03:21,041 --> 00:03:24,310
And actually happened to
Alfred's baby brother a meal.

55
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:28,510
So Alford's a baby brother Emil was
trying to synthesize a stable version of

56
00:03:28,511 --> 00:03:31,330
nitroglycerin. He failed
miserably. Unfortunately,

57
00:03:31,331 --> 00:03:34,000
he died as well as three of
his lab mates. So, you know,

58
00:03:34,001 --> 00:03:36,880
I use that as a cautionary
tale in my lab all the time.

59
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:39,850
And just three years later,
Alfred invented dynamite.

60
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:41,470
And I'll talk about
that in the next slide.

61
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:45,580
But dynamite was a real revolution
because it was stabilized.

62
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,910
It was actually made of completely
edible ingredients. Nitroglycerin,

63
00:03:48,911 --> 00:03:52,240
which Alfred himself would
take for angina. And, uh, and,

64
00:03:52,241 --> 00:03:55,000
and things like chalk and anti
acids and things like that.

65
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:57,160
But when combined in just
the right proportion,

66
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,210
as many inventions of that you guys are
familiar with, then you get the secret.

67
00:04:01,211 --> 00:04:04,390
You get the secret sauce that really
made Alfred one of the richest people in

68
00:04:04,391 --> 00:04:05,224
the world.

69
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:10,380
Then an 1888 Alfred was walking around
in Paris where he would soon be exiled

70
00:04:10,691 --> 00:04:14,620
for, for a siding with the
enemy of France, namely Italy,

71
00:04:14,621 --> 00:04:17,740
and building them war munitions.
And he was walking down the street.

72
00:04:17,741 --> 00:04:22,450
So I headline and the headline said, the
merchant of death, Alfred Nobel is dead.

73
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,990
And there was like a celebratory obituary,
if you can imagine that.

74
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:30,610
Very obstreperous. So he, he saw this
headline and he realized, hmm, you know,

75
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,020
I'm very much alive.
You know,

76
00:04:32,021 --> 00:04:34,360
the reports of my demise are
a little bit exaggerated,

77
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:37,720
but it was actually his older brother
Ludvig the one who had received control,

78
00:04:37,721 --> 00:04:39,970
the business of Nobel
and sons from his father.

79
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:42,920
So Alfred read that and actually it,

80
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:46,870
he treated it as a great gift because
he realized that if he didn't change his

81
00:04:46,871 --> 00:04:50,320
ways, that the way the newspaper
described him as the merchant of death,

82
00:04:50,321 --> 00:04:54,220
the person responsible for more deaths
in human history than any other person,

83
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,710
that would be the legacy that
he would be remembered by.

84
00:04:56,980 --> 00:05:00,520
So he resolved then to change
this. And he really, and my sense,

85
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:04,180
he endowed the Nobel prize a
few years later in an attempt,

86
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:07,510
I think at public relations
and it was wildly successful.

87
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:12,780
So if you go to Google, patents are
patents.google. You'll find, uh,

88
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:17,260
an invention list of 355 inventions.
The most profitable was dynamite.

89
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,480
Dynamite outfit. Nobel. Actually,

90
00:05:19,481 --> 00:05:23,080
he did some ab testing on Google
adwords back then and he was going to

91
00:05:23,081 --> 00:05:25,660
originally call it Nobel's safety powder.
You know,

92
00:05:25,661 --> 00:05:27,610
it was like a euphemism
because he wanted to,

93
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:30,340
people knew that Nitroglycerin
was very, uh, you know,

94
00:05:30,341 --> 00:05:32,740
have this connotation of being deadly.
In fact,

95
00:05:32,741 --> 00:05:36,100
when people at the drug store would
have to buy nitroglycerin 18 hundreds,

96
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:37,480
they wouldn't ask for it.
They call it,

97
00:05:37,481 --> 00:05:40,210
they made up a name for our called
trying to train or something like that.

98
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:43,330
And that was done to not scare
the chemist or the pharmacist.

99
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:46,050
So he made this a substance later the,

100
00:05:46,051 --> 00:05:50,440
the a choice and the Ab testing
dynamite one and it means power rock.

101
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:52,960
And there's some pictures of
what it looked like. And uh,

102
00:05:52,961 --> 00:05:56,590
this made him one of the wealthiest
people in the world at that time.

103
00:05:57,650 --> 00:06:01,400
With that money, he endowed this
Medallian, this prize that bears his name.

104
00:06:01,401 --> 00:06:05,150
He indict endowed five prizes
and peace, chemistry, literature,

105
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:08,030
medicine or physiology,
and my field of physics.

106
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:11,330
And what was so interesting to me is to,

107
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:14,090
as I'll show you later on
in the pro in this talk,

108
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:16,340
not only did I personally
lose the Nobel prize,

109
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:19,700
but I was asked to nominate the winners
of the Nobel prize the very next year

110
00:06:19,701 --> 00:06:23,460
after I lost it. Okay. It's kind
of bittersweet and uh, and it,

111
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:28,310
and it actually led me to this voyage of
exploration and hopefully a reformation

112
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:31,040
for humanities superlative prize.

113
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:35,810
So this prize was endowed
by Alfred Nobel's will, and
he wrote it down by hand.

114
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:41,420
And the prize was, uh, was, was,
it was, it was so important to him.

115
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:45,550
He specified exactly what he wanted
to happen and what would be, uh, the,

116
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:49,610
the ultimate aim of this prize. And
I'll explain what he wanted as we go on.

117
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:54,530
But the first thing I want to say is
that, um, this story involves, uh, if you,

118
00:06:54,531 --> 00:06:57,680
if you will, the villain
in my book is, uh,

119
00:06:57,681 --> 00:07:00,680
is this very humble substance called dust.
And I have,

120
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:04,180
I'm blessed to have five children
now. I'm very familiar with dust, uh,

121
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:07,160
but it's a different kind of dust.
But, but it made me think back when,

122
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:10,520
when you'll see the encounter that I'll
describe scientifically in this book

123
00:07:10,521 --> 00:07:12,920
between dust and me and my experiment,

124
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:17,480
it made me think of the biblical verse
that goes ashes to ashes, dust to dust.

125
00:07:17,481 --> 00:07:19,610
So it means that humanity,
humans start off their life,

126
00:07:19,611 --> 00:07:22,040
basically is nothing but dust.
And then we end,

127
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:25,580
our ultimate aim of everybody is
dust. And so poetically. I thought,

128
00:07:25,581 --> 00:07:28,400
well that's kind of interesting because
the history of astronomy also begins in

129
00:07:28,401 --> 00:07:32,480
some sense with dust and
start us, literally flows
through our veins right now.

130
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:37,070
The iron in the hemoglobin in your blood
was once and the core of a supernova

131
00:07:37,071 --> 00:07:39,890
that exploded and
repopulated the universe,

132
00:07:39,891 --> 00:07:43,730
the cosmos in our local solar neighborhood
with heavy elements and those heavy

133
00:07:43,731 --> 00:07:47,060
elements eventually coalesced and
made their way into your bloodstream.

134
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:50,120
So dust is a villain in some sense
in this book as you'll find out.

135
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:54,470
But we're not the only ones who have been
bedeviled by dust devils in the cosmos.

136
00:07:54,471 --> 00:07:57,530
The first one was the first astronomer
and history to use a telescope.

137
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:01,580
Galileo Galilei, there's a sketch
of his telescope and he, of course,

138
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:02,930
there's a sketch of his telescope.

139
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:07,580
He used his telescope to make discoveries
that were impossible to make with the

140
00:08:07,581 --> 00:08:12,290
human eye unaided. And this telescope,
this tiny little thing that you can get a,

141
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:14,060
I'm not at a bookstore
sometimes on a bookstore,

142
00:08:14,061 --> 00:08:18,620
I'm forbidden to use a certain online
retailer that starts with a and a so.

143
00:08:18,621 --> 00:08:22,640
So I said, nowadays you
can buy a telescope online
on Google shopping.google.

144
00:08:22,641 --> 00:08:27,560
Right? And it costs less than some
apps that you guys probably make.

145
00:08:27,561 --> 00:08:30,110
Okay. So this is something that
if you have a child in your life,

146
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:32,600
even here in Los Angeles or
the bay area or wherever,

147
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:35,930
you can see the same exact sites that
Galileo saw. And what did he see?

148
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:39,710
Some of it is depicted here. Those
are his sketches. Some of the first,

149
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:44,750
what I call stop motion animation of
what the moons of Jupiter were doing.

150
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:46,400
So these are the orbits is a Pr,

151
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:51,380
a plot that he made in the early part
of 1610 of what the planet Jupiter look

152
00:08:51,381 --> 00:08:53,510
like through his telescope.
Tiny little thing.

153
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:58,320
And he saw that there were these stars
and he called these stars the muddied she

154
00:08:58,321 --> 00:09:01,980
satellites. So he named the the,
the satellites after his patrons,

155
00:09:01,981 --> 00:09:05,790
after his benefactors, the Medici
family of, of northern Italy.

156
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,600
And you see also he made depictions of
the planet Venus and saw that it had this

157
00:09:09,601 --> 00:09:12,540
strange behavior where it would
change its phase, its shape,

158
00:09:12,541 --> 00:09:14,730
it would look like a miniature
moon with Crescent, and then, uh,

159
00:09:14,731 --> 00:09:16,260
give us phase and the moon.

160
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,800
And Saturn appeared as if he had
these weird pitcher like ears on it.

161
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:23,910
And then you see the sketches of the moon
on the, uh, on the upper right as well.

162
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,490
So what Galileo did was so titanic,

163
00:09:26,491 --> 00:09:30,750
because he overthrew the paradigm and
that the Earth was the sole center of the

164
00:09:30,751 --> 00:09:31,500
universe.

165
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:34,500
So back then they considered the solar
system to be the entire universe.

166
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:37,080
And the Earth was the
center of the solar system.

167
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:40,350
So therefore the earth was the center
of this or the, of the entire universe.

168
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:44,310
What they didn't know until Galileo used
the telescope was that there were other

169
00:09:44,311 --> 00:09:45,750
centers of the solar system.

170
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:49,440
So it could not be unique that the
earth is the center of the solar system.

171
00:09:49,441 --> 00:09:53,300
If there's another center, namely the
planet Jupiter. So Galileo didn't as,

172
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:56,460
as people often misconstrue
what Galileo did,

173
00:09:56,461 --> 00:09:58,380
he didn't prove the Copernican hypothesis.

174
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:02,310
He didn't prove that the sun is the
center of the, uh, of the, uh, universe.

175
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:05,160
He's just disproved that the earth
is the only center of the universe.

176
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:09,810
Because I was an important, you know, if
overly belabored I'm an academician. Okay,

177
00:10:09,811 --> 00:10:12,990
so forgive me, but I claim, you
know, as brilliant as he was,

178
00:10:12,991 --> 00:10:17,400
he made some blunders and he made many
blunders and they were done in a service

179
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:22,500
to further confirm the Copernican
hypothesis. He went to his grave as you,

180
00:10:22,501 --> 00:10:26,640
as you may know, uh, for basically
committing the crime of heresy,

181
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:29,340
suggesting that the earth was
not the center of the universe.

182
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:30,781
And in part of that,

183
00:10:30,781 --> 00:10:35,010
he never really recanted this decision
that he believes so strongly in that he

184
00:10:35,011 --> 00:10:38,010
was, uh, basically unwilling to
part with. But not only that,

185
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:43,100
he used every piece of evidence that he
had in physics and in astronomy to try

186
00:10:43,561 --> 00:10:47,520
to bolster his argument. And it's a
phenomenon known as confirmation bias.

187
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:51,060
And we as human beings and scientists,
as you guys know,

188
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:54,630
are also human beings despite
the stereotypes to the contrary.

189
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:57,690
But this little asterisk them.
Does anyone know what this aster ism is?

190
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:01,440
Maybe some of you drive one of these
asterisk gums. This is Subaru in Japanese.

191
00:11:01,441 --> 00:11:03,510
It means the seven sisters a plea,
80s,

192
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:07,620
the eighties in Greek literature
where the nurses of Dionysus,

193
00:11:07,621 --> 00:11:11,450
who was the god of the grape. So he's
responsible for all our wine. Uh,

194
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:13,500
and they were his nurses.
I Dunno how they got that.

195
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:15,120
These little stars are like that.
In fact,

196
00:11:15,121 --> 00:11:18,290
you can only see six of them
with the even good eyes. Uh,

197
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:21,270
but Galileo went even further with this.
He looked at the constellation,

198
00:11:21,271 --> 00:11:26,100
there's a little asterisk and he
sketched it as it appeared to his eye.

199
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,150
And Edward Tufte, the famous, uh, uh,

200
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:32,370
kind of sociologist of science
or re recontour of science.

201
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:35,230
He calls Galileo the world's
first data scientist.

202
00:11:35,231 --> 00:11:38,670
So I'm sure there's a lot of data
scientists here. So if you see here,

203
00:11:38,671 --> 00:11:40,410
Dalai was depicting the Pleiades,

204
00:11:40,411 --> 00:11:43,290
the seven sisters and an
interesting unique fashion.

205
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:45,180
He showing two different types of stars.

206
00:11:45,181 --> 00:11:48,210
There are open stars like stars
of David was six points on them.

207
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:49,410
And then there's filled in,

208
00:11:49,411 --> 00:11:52,020
completely closed in stars
and they're totally different.

209
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:54,760
And I want you to for a second
what those could possibly mean.

210
00:11:54,761 --> 00:11:58,150
I actually gave this talk to a bunch of
astronomers at Caltech a couple of days

211
00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:01,480
ago and they couldn't understand that.
Almost none of them guess what it meant.

212
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:04,320
But I'll, I'll give you a second
to think about it. And then, uh,

213
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:06,940
we can also read what Galileo
rope beneath it. He said,

214
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:10,420
what we observed is the nature of
the matter of Milky Way itself,

215
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:13,630
which with the aid of the spyglass,
which is what he called the telescope,

216
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,790
is observed so well that it,

217
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:20,820
that all the disciplines that for so
many generations have vexed philosophers

218
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:26,340
can be destroyed by visible certainty
and we are liberated from their wordy

219
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:30,550
arguments. Okay. So back then, physicists
weren't great fans of philosophers,

220
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:34,630
even nowadays that's, that's also held
to be true. But if you're, if you're,

221
00:12:34,631 --> 00:12:37,840
if you haven't come up with the answer
to what do these different types of

222
00:12:37,841 --> 00:12:41,170
iconography, what did they
represent? The stars that are open,

223
00:12:41,171 --> 00:12:42,640
these six pointed stars of Dave,

224
00:12:42,641 --> 00:12:47,020
those represents stars that the human
eye can see on aided the stars that are

225
00:12:47,021 --> 00:12:49,810
black and filled in or those that
he can only see with a telescope.

226
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:53,200
And he said that the entire constantly,
or the tire aster ism,

227
00:12:53,201 --> 00:12:54,850
it's technically not
called the constellation,

228
00:12:54,851 --> 00:12:58,240
but it's a little collection of stars
that the entire star collection,

229
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:01,750
which is shown here through the
Hubble telescope, that this can be,

230
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:06,580
could be resolved into stars,
even the glowing gaseous nebulosity,

231
00:13:06,581 --> 00:13:07,990
what we call nebulosity now,

232
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:12,760
when in fact now we know that even
with a much more powerful telescope,

233
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:16,840
even the Hubble telescope 50 times
bigger in diameter, uh, then,

234
00:13:16,841 --> 00:13:20,380
then Galileo's that you still can't
resolve the nebulosity and to stars.

235
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,520
And so what was it he was trying to say
that the nature of the Milky Way was

236
00:13:24,521 --> 00:13:27,330
purely made of stars.
So first he demoted the,

237
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:29,380
the earth from the center
of the solar system.

238
00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:32,920
Then he said the son could be the center
of the solar system. And then he said,

239
00:13:32,921 --> 00:13:36,370
the sun is just like any other star in
the Milky Way. So it's quite interesting.

240
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:41,080
Everything that he's using is done in a
furtherance of the Copernican hypothesis.

241
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:44,500
So it's a confirmation bias example,
par exsalonce.

242
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:48,700
He later went on to conjecture that the
tides that we feel here on earth are

243
00:13:48,701 --> 00:13:53,050
caused by the rotation of the earth on
its axis and also the revolution of the

244
00:13:53,051 --> 00:13:56,050
earth around the sun. We now know
that to be completely incorrect,

245
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,810
the tides that we feel, high tide,
low tide here near the beach,

246
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:02,170
are caused by the Moon's gravitational
influence. But why did he want to,

247
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:05,080
why do you want to say it was from
the Earth's motion around the sun?

248
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:08,530
Because that meant that the earth went
around the sun and it's completely wrong.

249
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:12,950
So even the greatest intellectual
physicist in history, Galileo, uh,

250
00:14:12,951 --> 00:14:17,350
to some of us made blunders and they were
done because of what he wanted to see.

251
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:20,740
And that's a theme that runs
throughout cosmology to this very day.

252
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:24,940
And sad to report affected us on my
project called Bicep that I'll talk about.

253
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:28,930
So Galileo made this blender, okay?
It's not the worst blender you can make,

254
00:14:28,931 --> 00:14:32,560
you know, with the first telescope in
human history. Uh, but you see here,

255
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:35,260
one other thing to notice is
that this is a nebulosity.

256
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:40,270
This nebulosity is not stars. It's
actually made of gas. It's made of dust,

257
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,790
and it's made a particles
that act like little mirrors.

258
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:44,560
And some of them are my metallic as well.

259
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:49,860
So we actually know that they twinkle
in a sense because of the reflection of

260
00:14:49,961 --> 00:14:52,400
the star light off of
tiny mirrors of dust.

261
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:56,600
So Galileo was deceived by dust into
thinking that the sun was just a star,

262
00:14:56,601 --> 00:14:57,710
like any other star.

263
00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:00,950
And the vast assemblage of stars
we call the Milky Way Galaxy.

264
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:04,790
So not all that twinkle's is a diamond.
So that'll be a theme throughout.

265
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,570
So again, the Copernican
model, which wasn't proven.

266
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:11,270
So by the standards of
mathematical proof in science,

267
00:15:11,271 --> 00:15:15,530
what we do is really disprove
other hypotheses. So what
Galileo technically did,

268
00:15:15,531 --> 00:15:20,531
his disprove the Ptolemaic Aristotelian
ancient Greek conception of the central

269
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:24,320
central position of the
Earth about the cosmos.

270
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:28,400
And you see the more complicated version
of Copernicus and Galileo on the right.

271
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:30,590
So what we're trying to do now,

272
00:15:30,591 --> 00:15:33,740
and what I describe in my book
is since the time of Galileo,

273
00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:36,680
there've been four other
Copernican revolutions,

274
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:41,510
there've been revolutions after Galileo
disabused humanity of its central

275
00:15:41,511 --> 00:15:45,020
purpose in central point in
the universe's arrangement.

276
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:47,960
The next group of astronomers
promptly forgot that lesson.

277
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:50,280
Then the best astronomer,
one of the best astronomers,

278
00:15:50,281 --> 00:15:54,380
the 17 hundreds named William Herschel.
He made a map of the Milky Way Galaxy,

279
00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:57,800
and guess where he put the earth and
the sun at the center of the Milky Way

280
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:01,150
Galaxy, where it's actually technically
not located there. The next, uh,

281
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:03,560
couple of what are called
great debates in my book,

282
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:07,820
they were corresponding to is the Milky
Way Galaxy, the center of the universe,

283
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:12,200
and was our galaxy central not
only in space, but in time.

284
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:17,060
Is there something special
about humanities, galaxy, et
Cetera, in time and space.

285
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:18,560
And then the question is,

286
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:23,590
is our universe the only universe or is
what's called the multiverse centered on

287
00:16:24,231 --> 00:16:27,200
us as well? That's the last of
the five debates in my book.

288
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:30,140
But I say there's many more of
these debates to come where humanity

289
00:16:30,141 --> 00:16:34,340
overemphasizes it's importance and
nature conspires like the ultimate big

290
00:16:34,341 --> 00:16:37,520
brother to say you're not that
great. And that's what happens. Okay.

291
00:16:37,521 --> 00:16:42,350
I've got a big brother and I've got three
sons and I'm also a big brother so I

292
00:16:42,351 --> 00:16:43,130
can say that.

293
00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:46,010
So I want to show you guys something kind
of cool cause this took place just up

294
00:16:46,011 --> 00:16:49,550
the road from you guys and it has a night.
A nice, really cool Google connection.

295
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:53,930
So in the 1960s this was
the original Internet. Okay.
So they launched a balloon.

296
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:58,610
Some are over central Kansas and from JPL,
just up the road in Pasadena,

297
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:03,560
they shot radio waves that bounced off
this giant metallic reflective mylar co

298
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:06,710
covered balloon. And they
bounced. Those signals are,

299
00:17:06,711 --> 00:17:11,180
they tried to bounce those signals to a
receiving horn in Homedale New Jersey.

300
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:14,360
So it was trans continental
communication with radio waves.

301
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:19,630
And so what this reminds me of nowadays
is what you guys do here or do elsewhere

302
00:17:20,301 --> 00:17:23,540
within the, within the
corporation is get Internet. Okay?

303
00:17:23,541 --> 00:17:27,350
Except this Internet says your motto is
balloon powered Internet for everyone.

304
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:30,740
So that was balloon powered Internet
for one communicator at a time.

305
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:32,500
So if they were, you know, if, if,

306
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:34,820
if someone was on the phone
or using the Internet,

307
00:17:34,821 --> 00:17:36,320
it was much worse than dial up even.

308
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:40,400
But they found they couldn't get it to
work because the balloon signal decreases.

309
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:43,580
Uh, sort of like the fourth power of the
distance they were trying to transmit.

310
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:47,420
So instead they launched a tiny little
satellite into space and it was called

311
00:17:47,421 --> 00:17:48,980
Telstar.
Now you guys,

312
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:53,370
by the looks of it are way too young to
remember when the first communication

313
00:17:53,371 --> 00:17:55,560
satellites were launched.
But actually Sputnik,

314
00:17:55,561 --> 00:17:59,310
the very first satellite ever launched
and the night late 1950s was basically a

315
00:17:59,311 --> 00:18:00,300
radio transmitter.

316
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:03,030
And that solved a lot of the
problems of the inverse square law,

317
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:06,420
which kills the power,
transmitted and kills the power received.

318
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:09,960
And so they launched a satellite
into space and these astronomers,

319
00:18:09,961 --> 00:18:13,260
Penzias and Wilson using that same
horn and 10 I used with the reflective

320
00:18:13,261 --> 00:18:14,094
balloon,

321
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:17,100
they were using this to see if they
could see the signal to noise that they

322
00:18:17,101 --> 00:18:21,150
needed to do real internet
communications using a transceiver,

323
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:25,440
a device that could receive a signals
from California and the amplify them,

324
00:18:25,441 --> 00:18:28,320
boost them and send them down.
This work fantastically well,

325
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:31,050
except when they kept looking at the
satellite through their telescope,

326
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:32,460
they didn't get the signal to noise.

327
00:18:32,461 --> 00:18:36,390
They predicted and they were very diligent
scientists and they tracked down all

328
00:18:36,391 --> 00:18:39,420
the sources of error they could find,
including the fact that there was a,

329
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:43,860
there was a nest of pigeons inside of
this antenna that would not go away.

330
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:46,110
In fact,
Penzias over here.

331
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:50,040
He took them in his car and drove him
from northern New Jersey to Philadelphia,

332
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:53,310
and guess what? These are homing
pigeons. So what do they do?

333
00:18:53,490 --> 00:18:55,590
They came back and they described it,

334
00:18:55,591 --> 00:19:00,591
these pigeons as leaving a
white dielectric material
inside the heart that they

335
00:19:00,931 --> 00:19:02,700
couldn't get her.
They scrubbed that they cleaned it.

336
00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:05,880
Finally they couldn't get rid of
it. So they went to to um, you know,

337
00:19:05,881 --> 00:19:09,780
their quarter master or whatever and they
said, we need a shotgun. And they said,

338
00:19:09,781 --> 00:19:11,910
why? They said, we've got to
kill these birds. And they did.

339
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:14,100
And Penzias later recounted,

340
00:19:14,101 --> 00:19:18,000
he said the birds left with a little
bang and then we discovered the big bang.

341
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:19,440
And that's really what happened next.

342
00:19:19,441 --> 00:19:24,000
So they ended up making a map of the sky
that they could not remove a persistent

343
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:28,470
three degree Kelvin above absolute
zero glow coming in all directions,

344
00:19:28,471 --> 00:19:32,130
which if you had microwave vision to
your eyes without the aid of boosting

345
00:19:32,131 --> 00:19:33,900
contrast,
this is what you'd see.

346
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,180
If you could see microwave's
you'd go out and look around.

347
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:41,010
Everything surrounding the earth would
be colored in a certain sense. Constant,

348
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:44,790
persistent, never changing with
season or direction or anything.

349
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:48,450
It's a background that comes from the
big bang because they were looking back

350
00:19:48,451 --> 00:19:50,850
not only in space,
but they were looking back in time.

351
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:53,580
Nowadays we can subtract
the average signal.

352
00:19:53,581 --> 00:19:56,650
This three Kelvin signal and
some of my colleagues at, uh,

353
00:19:56,860 --> 00:20:00,960
NASA made an a beautiful animation of
what this picture would look like if you

354
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:04,110
add very high contrast.
In addition to high sensitivity,

355
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:07,410
you would see tiny ripples,
tiny fluctuations in this pattern.

356
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:11,490
So if you zoom in on this image
after boosting up it's contrast,

357
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:13,860
you see that it has
fluctuations in temperature,

358
00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:17,460
the temperature is not exactly three
Kelvin and some places it's three Kelvin

359
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:21,930
plus 10 Microkelvin, 10 millions of a
Calvin and some other places. It's 10,

360
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:23,970
three Kelvin minus 10.
Microkelvin.

361
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:27,600
That's about the size of how much it
varies from point to point on the sky.

362
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:31,500
And thank goodness it does vary
because without those variations,

363
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:35,160
the matter that makes up the stars and
galaxies in our universe wouldn't know

364
00:20:35,161 --> 00:20:38,190
where to coagulate in a uniform universe.

365
00:20:38,191 --> 00:20:42,060
And it was known that this was true from
the time of Laplas and Newton, that the,

366
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:42,151
uh,

367
00:20:42,151 --> 00:20:46,020
uniformly distributed universal uniform
matter throughout would never provide a

368
00:20:46,021 --> 00:20:49,810
nucleation site for matter to a
agglomerate to create the stars,

369
00:20:49,811 --> 00:20:53,890
planets and galaxies that we see today.
So that's a nice image there.

370
00:20:54,010 --> 00:20:57,010
The question is what caused those
fluctuations? In the beginning,

371
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:00,610
you could imagine that you could explain
something if it was perfectly smooth

372
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:03,370
and you can explain something
that is widely, not smooth,

373
00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:07,000
but it's very hard to get fine
tuned amounts of fluctuation.

374
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:10,870
So 10 microkelvin out of say,
let's just call it 10 Kelvin,

375
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:14,110
that's a few parts per million.
It's fine tuning.

376
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:18,610
Where does that smoothness come from?
That's smooth but not perfectly smooth.

377
00:21:18,670 --> 00:21:20,980
It's actually smoother than
the surface of a bowling ball.

378
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:24,400
Any bowling ball smoother than my bowling
ball because I'm a terrible bowler and

379
00:21:24,401 --> 00:21:27,740
I make big dents in it, but the surface
of a bowling ball compared to its,

380
00:21:27,741 --> 00:21:32,320
its radius instantaneously compared to
its average radius varies by about 10

381
00:21:32,321 --> 00:21:36,220
times that amount. The Universe is much
smoother than anything than any other,

382
00:21:36,221 --> 00:21:38,320
you know, naturally occurring thing
that you might be familiar with.

383
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:42,640
So we set out to try to understand
where do those fluctuations come from.

384
00:21:42,850 --> 00:21:45,130
And we built a telescope
called Bicep to do it.

385
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:48,630
The theory underpinning why there
should be fluctuations. The,

386
00:21:48,631 --> 00:21:51,010
the leading candidate
theory is called inflation.

387
00:21:51,430 --> 00:21:54,280
Inflation predicts that in
the extremely early universe,

388
00:21:54,281 --> 00:21:57,700
a trillionth of a trillionth of a
trillionth after the big bang that the

389
00:21:57,701 --> 00:22:01,360
universe underwent this strange kind
of phase transition that was quantum in

390
00:22:01,361 --> 00:22:02,140
nature.

391
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:06,070
And the amount of expansion varied from
point to point in space because quantum

392
00:22:06,071 --> 00:22:06,821
fields do that.

393
00:22:06,821 --> 00:22:10,180
There are rare random variables and
they'll have fluctuations in them that

394
00:22:10,181 --> 00:22:12,640
technically are called
Gaussian random fluctuations.

395
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:16,890
And that could lead to enough fine tuning
that you could get a universe that's

396
00:22:16,891 --> 00:22:19,570
smooth but not perfectly
smooth. And again, without the,

397
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:24,220
without the deviation from perfect
smoothness, we would not be here.

398
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:28,090
There'd be no way for galaxy to know
where to form if you like. So we were,

399
00:22:28,091 --> 00:22:32,050
we were interested in trying to measure
this extremely early fraction of a,

400
00:22:32,051 --> 00:22:34,450
of a trillionth of a trillionth
of a second after the big bang.

401
00:22:34,630 --> 00:22:35,830
This is called inflation.

402
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:39,220
It's very hard to depict something that
nobody knows anything really about.

403
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:42,070
And so, you know, sometimes it's
just shown as a giant question mark.

404
00:22:42,071 --> 00:22:43,180
I don't think that's too useful.

405
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:46,900
This is meant to illustrate that the
universe had these quantum fluctuations

406
00:22:46,901 --> 00:22:50,680
throughout it and they would lead to
variations which would later cause these

407
00:22:50,681 --> 00:22:52,630
temperature patterns to originate.

408
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:57,190
And that's exactly the leading candidate
of the early cosmo genic theory of,

409
00:22:57,260 --> 00:23:01,840
of the universe. So I like to compare
this to another form of evolution.

410
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:06,370
So if there are some, you know, biology,
uh, uh, Aficionados in the audience,

411
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:09,880
you may recognize this object.
This is called a blastocyst.

412
00:23:10,150 --> 00:23:14,560
It's a collection of human cells about a
thousand seconds after your parents had

413
00:23:14,561 --> 00:23:16,120
their own personal big bang.

414
00:23:17,410 --> 00:23:21,670
This object has about a hundred or so
cells and it will later evolve into

415
00:23:21,671 --> 00:23:22,780
somebody.
But we're,

416
00:23:22,781 --> 00:23:26,320
we're trying to do is take an image of
somebody today or the universe as it

417
00:23:26,321 --> 00:23:30,250
looks to us today and then extrapolate
back in time to what the universe was

418
00:23:30,251 --> 00:23:32,440
like 50 orders of
magnitude earlier in time.

419
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,960
Here's what you look like
at a thousand seconds.

420
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:38,800
And imagine trying to understand what the,
what this blastocyst is embryo become.

421
00:23:38,801 --> 00:23:42,310
What would it look like? Who has a guest?
Anyone have a guess at Eric Schmidt? No,

422
00:23:42,311 --> 00:23:45,720
nobody liked that. Okay. So I'll give
you a hint. I'm going to you a hint here.

423
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:48,470
I'll go put some identifying
features on the blastocyst.

424
00:23:48,471 --> 00:23:53,471
And then of course we recognize it as
my children's favorite astrophysicist.

425
00:23:53,511 --> 00:23:58,250
You don't know how bad that feels.
Okay? And I'm care about Daddy.

426
00:23:58,251 --> 00:23:59,840
They care about Neil.
Uh,

427
00:23:59,841 --> 00:24:04,190
so here's how he looks at an age of
about being generous. 2 billion seconds.

428
00:24:04,191 --> 00:24:08,240
You want to feel old, quote your agent
seconds. That's about 50, 59 years,

429
00:24:08,241 --> 00:24:09,430
I think he is.
Um,

430
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:12,440
and if you want to extrapolate back
to what he was as a blastocyst,

431
00:24:12,441 --> 00:24:16,040
that's a factor of 2 million.
We're trying to go 50 orders of magnitude,

432
00:24:16,041 --> 00:24:18,830
not six orders of magnitude,
50 orders of magnitude.

433
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:23,360
We thought we could do it using a very
special type of telescope because the

434
00:24:23,361 --> 00:24:24,850
Telus, if the telescope,
we're sensitive, what,

435
00:24:24,851 --> 00:24:26,660
what's called the lights polarization,

436
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:31,100
then the reverberations of
spacetime produced during inflation.

437
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:35,270
What produced this crazy twisting curl
mode pattern on the microwave sky.

438
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:37,430
So in addition to the
temperature fluctuations,

439
00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:40,400
there'd be variations in polarization.
So we have Polaroids.

440
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:43,730
You guys living in southern California
to have to have these, they're de Rigor.

441
00:24:43,731 --> 00:24:47,960
These are my state university funded
a solid sunglasses that I get to wear.

442
00:24:48,650 --> 00:24:51,620
These are sensitive to one
orientation of the lights,

443
00:24:51,621 --> 00:24:54,770
polarization and as you rotate
one versus the other one,

444
00:24:54,771 --> 00:24:56,960
you go from light to
dark to light to dark.

445
00:24:57,020 --> 00:25:01,430
So it rotates twice in amplitude for
every single physical rotation of these

446
00:25:01,431 --> 00:25:05,420
Polaroids. We did the same thing, not
with optical light but with microwaves.

447
00:25:05,690 --> 00:25:08,360
And what we did is we claimed that
there was evidence for what are called

448
00:25:08,361 --> 00:25:11,420
gravitational waves produced
during the big bangs,

449
00:25:11,421 --> 00:25:16,421
inflationary epoch that shook up space
time so violently that it caused these

450
00:25:16,641 --> 00:25:19,190
patterns to originate.
And that was what we claim we discovered.

451
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:23,930
I'm going to talk to you about that. We
use this instrument here called it bicep.

452
00:25:23,931 --> 00:25:26,140
I coined the term, uh, it's uh,

453
00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:30,170
stands for by background imager of
cosmic extra galactic polarization,

454
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:33,050
but it was really called that because
the pattern that we're looking for these

455
00:25:33,051 --> 00:25:35,840
swirling, curling, twisting patterns.

456
00:25:36,050 --> 00:25:38,000
And I thought it was kind of
cute that the Bicep, you know,

457
00:25:38,001 --> 00:25:40,520
you guys go down to the gym here,
you work in the Bicep,

458
00:25:40,521 --> 00:25:43,400
that's the muscle that powers
you to do curls. And I thought,

459
00:25:43,401 --> 00:25:47,270
well that's kind of a cute name for this.
It's actually a gal lane spyglass.

460
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:50,840
It's just a microwave spyglass
so I brought some of our
detectors here and here

461
00:25:50,841 --> 00:25:51,740
and what they look like,

462
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:55,640
but they're sensitive to wavelengths of
light of about two millimeters instead

463
00:25:55,641 --> 00:25:59,210
of 500 microns. Like your ion sensitive
to, these are sensitive to much,

464
00:25:59,211 --> 00:26:02,990
much longer wave lengths where the
microwave signal gets the brightest.

465
00:26:03,050 --> 00:26:04,940
Where we observe these
photons from the big bang.

466
00:26:05,810 --> 00:26:08,630
The lenses are made of ordinary
milk jug like material.

467
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:13,160
Let me go back just like you'd find in
a milk jug and you know that a milk jug

468
00:26:13,161 --> 00:26:16,400
can actually transmit light through it
or heat through it because you've picked

469
00:26:16,401 --> 00:26:19,220
up a milk jug at the supermarket and
you feel it's cold even though you can't

470
00:26:19,221 --> 00:26:20,960
see through these lenses with your eye.

471
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:24,590
They transmit microwaves perfectly
and they actually bend and refract

472
00:26:24,591 --> 00:26:28,940
microwave's. Instead of
landing on Galileo's a retina,
they land on these, uh,

473
00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:33,950
these super conducting sensors that were
built up at JPL and they're over here

474
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:35,570
an example of those.

475
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:40,280
So these sensors transduce the microwave
heat into electrical resistance and

476
00:26:40,281 --> 00:26:43,770
then we're able to measure that and the
superconductor very, very accurately.

477
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:47,470
Instead of having a, you know,
a, a 10 megapixels like the,

478
00:26:47,730 --> 00:26:51,900
what's the current droid model? Uh,
so we only had about 256 pixels,

479
00:26:51,901 --> 00:26:55,770
so we had less than a milli megapixel.
Uh, so it's not that powerful,

480
00:26:55,771 --> 00:26:59,820
but don't take your droid and do what we
did to it. Namely cool it down to 450,

481
00:26:59,821 --> 00:27:02,730
four degrees below zero Fahrenheit,
cause it won't oil void the warranty,

482
00:27:02,731 --> 00:27:03,630
I'm sure about that.

483
00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:06,060
And I don't know what kind of
plant replacement plan you're on.

484
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:10,560
So we ended up putting this telescope
instead of in Galileo's hands,

485
00:27:10,650 --> 00:27:13,370
we put it in a mount that
we tested here in Caltech,

486
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:16,380
and then we shipped it down to
the very bottom of the world.

487
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:20,190
So this is a telescope that's very
much human sized except an addition.

488
00:27:20,191 --> 00:27:22,650
Instead of looking through
visible light like Galileo did,

489
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:25,740
it looked through microwave and the
microwave regime of the electromagnetic

490
00:27:25,741 --> 00:27:26,400
spectrum.

491
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:30,660
Then we digitize the resistance that
these detectors see as they scan the sky

492
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:32,460
and rotated the polarization.

493
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:36,930
Then we use supercomputers at Harvard
and elsewhere to, to process these,

494
00:27:36,931 --> 00:27:39,870
you know, many, many gigabytes of
data collected over three years.

495
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:42,630
The telescope had to be brought somewhere.
Very nice.

496
00:27:42,631 --> 00:27:44,970
I would have liked to have brought it,
you know, kept it at the, you know,

497
00:27:44,971 --> 00:27:46,380
in San Diego or Caltech.

498
00:27:46,590 --> 00:27:50,190
We ended up taking it to the South
Pole because the South Pole is the, uh,

499
00:27:50,191 --> 00:27:52,860
is one of the highest and
driest continents on earth.

500
00:27:52,890 --> 00:27:55,710
The Antarctica is and dryness
as important as, you know,

501
00:27:55,711 --> 00:27:58,980
when you go to the commissary
here, whatever cafeteria here, um,

502
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:02,130
I don't know how you guys all stay in
shape by the way, but when you go there,

503
00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:06,330
you heat up water in the microwave, the
cup, if it's ceramic will not get hot.

504
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:10,350
You can touch the cup right after boiling
the water, water absorbers, microwaves,

505
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:11,850
and it does so very efficiently.

506
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:14,970
That means water molecules in the
earth's atmosphere will also absorbed

507
00:28:14,971 --> 00:28:16,620
microwaves.
We don't want that happening.

508
00:28:16,770 --> 00:28:20,310
These photons have been traveling
for 13.8 2 billion years.

509
00:28:20,430 --> 00:28:23,130
We don't want them to get absorbed in
a water molecule floating above our

510
00:28:23,131 --> 00:28:27,330
observatory. So people say, well, why
don't you put it in space? And I said,

511
00:28:27,630 --> 00:28:30,060
why don't you give me $1 billion
and I'll be happy to do that?

512
00:28:30,150 --> 00:28:33,390
Because that's how much it costs a
hundred times more money to build a,

513
00:28:33,391 --> 00:28:37,440
an equivalent satellite object in space
if you get permission from NASA to do

514
00:28:37,441 --> 00:28:39,330
the launch or, or whoever. So,

515
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:44,360
so the early explorers in the 19 in 1911
1912 made it to the South Pole for the

516
00:28:44,641 --> 00:28:46,590
first time.
No one had ever seen it.

517
00:28:46,710 --> 00:28:50,820
People didn't even know
about the existence of the
continent of Antarctica until

518
00:28:50,821 --> 00:28:54,060
the mid 1800 say. And, but at that point,

519
00:28:54,061 --> 00:28:57,810
they only saw about half of 1% of it.
They knew nothing about this confident,

520
00:28:57,811 --> 00:29:01,440
which is much, much bigger than, than
the, um, than central United States.

521
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:04,980
So this is the second team that
ever reached the South Pole.

522
00:29:05,190 --> 00:29:10,020
This is a team led by Robert Falcon
Scott, and he got to the South Pole, uh,

523
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:14,550
uh, caring scientific equipment,
media rights that he had
collected along the way,

524
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:18,180
parts of Dead Sea lions that he had
found along the way. He was a scientist.

525
00:29:18,181 --> 00:29:19,410
He was doing an expedition.

526
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:23,100
He refused to use dogs because all the
dogs that had ever been to Antarctica,

527
00:29:23,101 --> 00:29:26,790
they're actually banned now to bring
dogs to Antarctica or any animals besides

528
00:29:26,791 --> 00:29:30,000
Grad students. Just kidding. Grad
students out there, um, you're,

529
00:29:30,001 --> 00:29:33,270
you're actually forbidden to bring any
animals down there because you always end

530
00:29:33,271 --> 00:29:36,420
up eating them. And they would,
in fact, the, the Swedish team,

531
00:29:36,510 --> 00:29:39,060
the Norwegian team that beat them,
they're led by Roald Amundsen.

532
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:41,800
Got to the South Pole
in three weeks or eight.

533
00:29:41,801 --> 00:29:44,390
The dogs had a big feast at the
South Pole, put a flag in the,

534
00:29:44,391 --> 00:29:49,360
in the snow and went back home down
10,000 feet of ice and 700 miles north.

535
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:52,090
Of course, everywhere is north from
there. This is the second team.

536
00:29:52,091 --> 00:29:56,840
And when Scott got there, he said, great
God, this is an awful place. And you know,

537
00:29:56,890 --> 00:30:00,580
I kind of felt exactly the opposite.
I felt this is a totally awesome place,

538
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:05,020
except it's not all fun and games as it
was back then for Scott. Oh no, he died.

539
00:30:05,050 --> 00:30:08,170
But, but um, but we live, but
it's very dangerous place to go.

540
00:30:08,171 --> 00:30:11,470
Is this video are captured last time
shows. Okay. You think it's really cute?

541
00:30:11,471 --> 00:30:15,190
But no, the penguins do not try
that. Although I say, you know,

542
00:30:15,210 --> 00:30:17,360
I have a lot of friends. I go out
to dinner, what they say, you know,

543
00:30:17,530 --> 00:30:20,110
I can't decide between chicken
and fish. I say, have a penguin.

544
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:24,040
It's like the best nowadays. It's an
awesome place when you're down there,

545
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:29,970
the US taxpayers, you hear and
you out there and on Youtube, uh,

546
00:30:30,010 --> 00:30:34,720
fund this wonderful station but $150
million station built over the last 15 or

547
00:30:34,721 --> 00:30:36,220
so years, we'd get, you know,

548
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:39,880
a private room and things that
Scott could never possibly imagine.

549
00:30:40,030 --> 00:30:43,480
Here's the axis on which the Earth was
spinning when I was there the last time,

550
00:30:43,890 --> 00:30:48,190
uh, in 2008, 2009, the Earth is
spinning about this access and you know,

551
00:30:48,191 --> 00:30:51,370
straight down through here is
the North Pole. So it's amazing.

552
00:30:51,371 --> 00:30:52,770
So I can actually run around the world.

553
00:30:52,771 --> 00:30:55,030
I'm not in good shape but I can
run around the world in 10 seconds.

554
00:30:55,031 --> 00:30:59,050
I think it's pretty cool. There you
go. There you have to check in on,

555
00:30:59,051 --> 00:31:01,510
you know Google plus.
Right? So I took a picture,

556
00:31:01,511 --> 00:31:06,250
send it to Google plus and there's the
building in which we put that instrument,

557
00:31:06,251 --> 00:31:10,240
that beautiful telescope that we spend
about five years building and it's called

558
00:31:10,450 --> 00:31:11,830
the observatory down here.

559
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:14,860
And then I always say the observatory
is the second most important building at

560
00:31:14,861 --> 00:31:17,470
the South Pole. Okay. Cause he gotta
you gotta take care of business,

561
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:20,530
but you notice the building is built up
on stilts and this might interest any of

562
00:31:20,531 --> 00:31:23,680
you are on the east from the east coast
as I am originally on the east coast.

563
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:26,830
They build houses on the beach up on
stilts because they don't want sand to

564
00:31:26,831 --> 00:31:30,010
cover him up or decay. The
foundation here, snow is the enemy.

565
00:31:30,190 --> 00:31:34,990
Snow would eventually over overflow over
the entire building within a only about

566
00:31:34,991 --> 00:31:38,050
a decade or so. So they, they
build it up on, on stilts.

567
00:31:38,051 --> 00:31:39,610
The snow can blow and pass right through.

568
00:31:39,790 --> 00:31:42,760
So the outhouse has been buried over
and we're working hard to get my grad

569
00:31:42,761 --> 00:31:45,580
student. No, no, no. The Grad
students find a, but it is a,

570
00:31:45,581 --> 00:31:48,430
they painted black to keep
it nice and warm and uh,

571
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:51,400
but it cannot be built up on
stilts that if I do, as I say,

572
00:31:51,401 --> 00:31:56,130
often that would be truly worthy of a
Nobel prize. A second story. Outhouse.

573
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:59,060
Okay. Don't, don't use them until,
until I've tested them for you.

574
00:32:00,310 --> 00:32:03,580
So of course, what do we have at
the South Pole? We have street view.

575
00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:08,050
I love this image down here. This
is what, this is what Google thinks.

576
00:32:08,550 --> 00:32:11,260
You know, if you get driving
directions to the South Hall, uh,

577
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:14,680
you get them from Google. This
is what street view shows.
So go visit street view.

578
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,480
You can actually pan
around and this is what,

579
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:19,930
this is what the bicep up to observatory.
It looks like. It's pretty cute.

580
00:32:21,010 --> 00:32:25,090
We made a huge announcement on
Saint Patrick's Day 2014 we said,

581
00:32:25,091 --> 00:32:30,091
we detected this twisting roiling boiling
surface of last scattering that was

582
00:32:30,550 --> 00:32:31,241
infused.

583
00:32:31,241 --> 00:32:35,190
We said with gravitational wave energy
and those gravitational waves we claimed

584
00:32:35,191 --> 00:32:38,320
could only have come from inflation.
So we made this huge announcement.

585
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:43,400
It got a of attention. Uh, there was a
huge media, you know, storm about it.

586
00:32:43,401 --> 00:32:46,850
There was a viral youtube video which
got millions of views. You know,

587
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,200
this is a scientific discovery,

588
00:32:48,201 --> 00:32:52,490
but very arcane abstract topic like
inflationary universe, cosmology,

589
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:56,810
gravitational waves, microwave
astronomy. And yet within minutes,

590
00:32:56,811 --> 00:32:58,550
millions of people had seen this video.

591
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:02,240
This is one of the founders of the theory
of inflation and his wife and their

592
00:33:02,241 --> 00:33:05,780
professors at Stanford along with one
of my colleagues channeling quo who's a

593
00:33:05,781 --> 00:33:06,770
professor at Stanford.

594
00:33:07,010 --> 00:33:11,180
There was a news conference at Harvard
and there was newspaper coverage all over

595
00:33:11,181 --> 00:33:14,390
the world.
The paper newspaper of record covered it.

596
00:33:14,570 --> 00:33:18,230
The San Diego Union Tribune I'm
speaking about. Um, so that was here.

597
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:21,800
They put the exact number of seconds
after the big bang that we claim to make

598
00:33:21,801 --> 00:33:25,820
the discovery. And I love this headline
over here. Hold on, I'll get to the onion.

599
00:33:25,821 --> 00:33:27,590
And the second, I like this
headline, the economist,

600
00:33:27,591 --> 00:33:29,720
cause it sounds like just
some dude was watching it.

601
00:33:29,721 --> 00:33:33,020
All of a sudden he saw the beginning
of the universe wholly chow.

602
00:33:34,130 --> 00:33:36,980
But for true hilarity,
we have to go to the onion.

603
00:33:36,981 --> 00:33:40,010
So within days of our discovery,
the onion comes out at this headline,

604
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:44,960
top theoretical physicist and R and B
singers meet to debate the meaning of

605
00:33:44,961 --> 00:33:48,540
forever. And you see down here we
can observe longterm phenomenal,

606
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:49,940
like the cosmic background radiation,

607
00:33:49,941 --> 00:33:54,230
primordial B mode polarization and the
love between India, Ari and her man.

608
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:57,560
All of which seem to have existed
since the universe is infancy.

609
00:33:58,370 --> 00:33:59,480
And the sub caption says,

610
00:33:59,490 --> 00:34:03,200
you the participants debate
if it's theoretically
possible to give you my heart

611
00:34:03,201 --> 00:34:06,110
forever. So I'll leave
it to the onion, right?

612
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:10,860
Alas are Nobel dreams were
not to last very long. Uh,

613
00:34:10,970 --> 00:34:15,800
it turned out that we made a discovery
and a very consistent discovery and that

614
00:34:15,801 --> 00:34:20,270
discovery turned out to be this very
mercurial substance called dust that I

615
00:34:20,271 --> 00:34:21,290
began to talk with.

616
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:24,860
So it turns out that there's dust in
the interstellar medium that comes from

617
00:34:24,861 --> 00:34:26,810
fail. Oops. That comes from failed stars.

618
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:29,420
Stars that have exploded
and so called Supernova.

619
00:34:29,810 --> 00:34:33,470
And these dust grains can sometimes be
made of iron such as the iron in our

620
00:34:33,471 --> 00:34:37,060
blood. That's exactly where it came from.
There wasn't some iron factory, you know,

621
00:34:37,070 --> 00:34:39,080
that made the hemoglobin molecules,

622
00:34:40,010 --> 00:34:43,400
these little grains of dust can become
magnetized if they're made of iron.

623
00:34:43,401 --> 00:34:47,150
And then they become like little compass
needles and it turns out the Milky Way

624
00:34:47,150 --> 00:34:48,890
Galaxy also has a magnetic field in it.

625
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:52,550
And a compass in a magnetic field will
orient towards the magnetic field lines.

626
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:56,480
And in such a case, it can actually
orient to produce the exact swirling,

627
00:34:56,481 --> 00:34:59,900
twisting, curling pattern that
bicep was designed to measure.

628
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:03,920
And in fact that became the most likely
culprit for the signal that we saw.

629
00:35:04,070 --> 00:35:06,740
We didn't make a blunder,
we didn't leave the lens cap on,

630
00:35:06,890 --> 00:35:09,770
but what we thought we were seeing is
back to the very beginning of time,

631
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:14,930
we thought we were searching from Earth
here in the South Pole looking past all

632
00:35:14,931 --> 00:35:17,000
the planets, galaxies,
plea eighties, everything.

633
00:35:17,210 --> 00:35:21,170
Even back to the beginning of time,
the Big Bang, the first few, uh,

634
00:35:21,350 --> 00:35:23,060
Chileans of a second after the big bang.

635
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:28,240
But instead what we were seeing was more
like dust between us and our delaxy and

636
00:35:28,281 --> 00:35:32,870
the surface and an exactly acted as
an as an imposter signal mimicking the

637
00:35:32,871 --> 00:35:37,410
signal. We tried to confirm, again,
this is a very pernicious phenomena,

638
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:42,150
a very common one in science confirmation
bias because we were told in part that

639
00:35:42,151 --> 00:35:46,950
we would get this, uh, of this beautiful
Medallia and I'll show you in a second.

640
00:35:47,190 --> 00:35:49,710
Um, uh, I do want to take away,
cause sometimes I've said,

641
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:52,530
I've given talks where people
ask me afterwards like,

642
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:54,450
you got to lay off the dust man.
Okay,

643
00:35:54,451 --> 00:35:56,190
this is like you're
being too harsh on dust.

644
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:59,580
Dust is great and I want to say
that I am very appreciative of dust.

645
00:35:59,610 --> 00:36:02,580
Not only does dust flow through our
star does flow through our veins,

646
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:06,330
but also as Carl Sagan poetically put it,
he turned,

647
00:36:06,331 --> 00:36:11,331
he had the NASA engineers turn the
voyager satellite around after it passed

648
00:36:12,151 --> 00:36:16,020
through doing the outer planets in our
solar system. And it took an image,

649
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:20,280
a selfie of the earth for millions of
miles past, past the orbit of Saturn.

650
00:36:20,730 --> 00:36:23,760
And he says here, this image here, and
you can see a tiny little dot. He says,

651
00:36:23,761 --> 00:36:28,350
you look at that, you see a dot. He says,
that's here. That's home. That's us.

652
00:36:28,830 --> 00:36:31,650
Every saint and sinner in life.
History of our species live,

653
00:36:31,770 --> 00:36:35,310
live there on a mode of
dust suspended in a sunbeam.

654
00:36:35,550 --> 00:36:39,510
This is a camera artifact, the sun beam
here, but it's so poetic and it is true.

655
00:36:39,511 --> 00:36:39,710
The,

656
00:36:39,710 --> 00:36:44,710
the earth is a giant ball of dust that
collaborated over eons to form a solid

657
00:36:45,331 --> 00:36:46,860
surface that we can stand on.
Again,

658
00:36:46,890 --> 00:36:49,500
thank goodness or else we wouldn't
be here to have this conversation.

659
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:54,800
Dust creates, it creates life. It
creates planets, but it also can destroy,

660
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:59,880
I destroys Nobel prizes. And
so a, to add insult to injury,

661
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,600
not long after we had
the discovery retracted,

662
00:37:03,690 --> 00:37:07,530
not after we went through
this embarrassing painful
process of having to retract

663
00:37:07,550 --> 00:37:10,500
the claims that we made.
I note that we always have,

664
00:37:10,501 --> 00:37:13,920
we always see front page
headlines and press conferences,

665
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:17,970
but you never see front page headline
retraction of previous front page headline

666
00:37:18,190 --> 00:37:21,030
or a press conference. We have
to tell you we were wrong. Uh,

667
00:37:21,031 --> 00:37:25,920
so it seems like the media or in part
to blame for stoking the attitude within

668
00:37:25,921 --> 00:37:28,620
scientists that,
that the press conferences in newspapers,

669
00:37:28,621 --> 00:37:31,380
and I'm as guilty as anyone of this,
but uh,

670
00:37:31,381 --> 00:37:34,800
there's an immense pressure in
academia to, to produce these.

671
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:38,610
Everything has to be an outstanding
breakthrough and very rarely does that

672
00:37:38,611 --> 00:37:39,570
actually take place.

673
00:37:39,690 --> 00:37:43,020
And part of the book is written in such
a way as to give hope to people that

674
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:46,410
most people don't win the Nobel prize.
Most people don't win the Oscars.

675
00:37:46,411 --> 00:37:49,290
Most people don't when they're high
school class presidency. Right?

676
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:53,130
So how do you deal with failure,
embarrassment, humiliation even,

677
00:37:53,250 --> 00:37:56,490
and get back up,
dust yourself off and get back to work.

678
00:37:56,730 --> 00:37:58,860
So to add insult to injury though for me,

679
00:37:59,670 --> 00:38:04,670
I came into work in October of 2015 and
I found this document that said two dear

680
00:38:06,211 --> 00:38:07,380
Professor Brian Keating,

681
00:38:07,530 --> 00:38:11,580
we have the honor to ask you to nominate
the winners of the next Nobel prize.

682
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:13,710
Okay. So you know, it's like he got fired,

683
00:38:13,711 --> 00:38:17,520
but can you give a recommendation to the
diversion that should take your job and

684
00:38:17,521 --> 00:38:19,080
interview a interview her?

685
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:22,950
So this was a letter that was
mark strictly confidential.
So don't tell anybody.

686
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:25,140
Okay. Ain't nobody out there
telling anybody, but it was,

687
00:38:25,650 --> 00:38:29,970
it was asking me to nominate the winners
of the Nobel Prize in physics. And, uh,

688
00:38:29,971 --> 00:38:30,581
and it was a,

689
00:38:30,581 --> 00:38:34,500
it was part of a small set of people
that are chosen randomly but not so

690
00:38:34,501 --> 00:38:38,530
randomly as I might get a chance
to describe and Q and a but a of,

691
00:38:38,531 --> 00:38:40,570
of who should win the
Nobel prize each year.

692
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:45,340
And this actually set me on a very
interesting quest that became the second

693
00:38:45,341 --> 00:38:47,920
meaning of the double
entendre of the book's title.

694
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:50,410
So the first meeting is how
I lost the noble prize dude,

695
00:38:50,470 --> 00:38:52,060
thanks to dust or no thanks to the US.

696
00:38:52,450 --> 00:38:55,960
And the second meaning is what I learned
about the Nobel prize that shocked me.

697
00:38:56,230 --> 00:39:00,010
And in the process of nominating
winters, uh, for the 2016 prize.

698
00:39:01,090 --> 00:39:04,360
So I'm an academic, right? So
what do we do as academicians?

699
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:06,730
We go back and look at
primary reference material.

700
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,890
So I went back to Alfred Nobel's will,

701
00:39:09,010 --> 00:39:12,730
and I'm fluent in Swedish as we
all are now. So I couldn't read it,

702
00:39:12,731 --> 00:39:15,070
but thankfully it's translated online.
You could find it.

703
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:18,130
And what I found in his
will was really surprising.

704
00:39:18,131 --> 00:39:22,060
And what it's led to in the preceding
hundred and 20 years since he wrote down

705
00:39:22,061 --> 00:39:26,470
the will and hundred and set and 16 years
of Nobel prizes is quite surprising.

706
00:39:27,470 --> 00:39:29,680
So what he said was in his will,
he said,

707
00:39:29,681 --> 00:39:34,000
the whole of my estate should be given
and divided in the following way.

708
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:38,170
A portion of it should be given to
the person or the persons there,

709
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:42,190
the person during the preceding year who
has conferred the greatest benefit to

710
00:39:42,191 --> 00:39:46,870
mankind. And it says later, one
part to the person, not in the,

711
00:39:46,930 --> 00:39:49,810
in the, in the plural, in
the singular. So Nobel prize,

712
00:39:49,811 --> 00:39:53,560
it should be given for discoveries or
inventions that had the greatest benefit

713
00:39:53,561 --> 00:39:56,860
to mankind in the preceding year.
And I started to think, hmm,

714
00:39:56,861 --> 00:40:01,861
how many astrophysics discoveries have
benefited all of mankind and done so in a

715
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:03,520
year?
And it started to make me think of like,

716
00:40:03,521 --> 00:40:07,780
what were the original intents of the
Nobel prize and how did those early Nobel

717
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:12,400
Prizes get carried out? And how have we
overlooked great discoveries, uh, or not.

718
00:40:12,401 --> 00:40:15,490
So I'm going to show you here.
I'm going to give a quiz, which I,

719
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:18,230
which I gave at Facebook and they all
got it right? So I want to ask you guys,

720
00:40:18,231 --> 00:40:22,240
see as how you guys are. Good. Okay. So,
um, am I allowed to say Facebook? Okay.

721
00:40:22,270 --> 00:40:24,990
So I wanted to ask you guys, there's
three choices here. A, B, and c.

722
00:40:24,991 --> 00:40:28,780
So raise your hand if you think the
RNA molecule won the Nobel prize.

723
00:40:28,781 --> 00:40:30,430
These are all eligible
for the Nobel prize.

724
00:40:30,431 --> 00:40:32,140
They're all invented
after Alpha Nobel stuff.

725
00:40:32,530 --> 00:40:34,690
Anybody think that the RNA molecule,

726
00:40:34,691 --> 00:40:37,930
the most important precursor building
block of human life and other lives?

727
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:42,430
Nobody. Okay. A couple people. Good. The
periodic table choice B, raise your hand.

728
00:40:42,431 --> 00:40:44,170
You think periodic table.
I remind you.

729
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:49,120
There's an element on there
called no Belgium. Okay.
Invented by men to live. Okay.

730
00:40:49,121 --> 00:40:52,640
There's like one or two of you guys.
Good, good. And then choice c, uh,

731
00:40:52,641 --> 00:40:54,530
appears to be like a lighthouse.

732
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:58,180
Anybody think the lighthouse
could the lighthouse? Really?

733
00:40:58,300 --> 00:41:00,550
You guys think the light? God,
the guys at Facebook got it.

734
00:41:00,590 --> 00:41:04,510
Now of course it's the lighthouse.
Of course.

735
00:41:04,990 --> 00:41:09,430
It was given to Gustov the in 1912 for
his invention of automatic regulators for

736
00:41:09,450 --> 00:41:13,510
using automatic automators and boom,
lighthouses and buoys.

737
00:41:13,870 --> 00:41:17,020
Unbelievable. It benefits our life every
day, doesn't it? I mean I was just,

738
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:19,960
I had to come up here from San Diego
and I thank God I had those gas

739
00:41:19,961 --> 00:41:23,560
accumulators guiding me
along the way. So, okay,

740
00:41:23,561 --> 00:41:26,020
so maybe that was just an early blunder,
but actually it's typical.

741
00:41:26,021 --> 00:41:28,960
It's actually what Alfred Nobel
wanted. He was an inventor, right?

742
00:41:28,961 --> 00:41:32,950
He had Google patents Galore and he wanted
to reward things and this did benefit

743
00:41:33,230 --> 00:41:33,860
back in,
you know,

744
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:36,770
people were crashing into rocks
and Sweden and he didn't want that.

745
00:41:36,770 --> 00:41:39,290
So this was very typical
actually of what he wanted.

746
00:41:39,470 --> 00:41:41,660
And it's more of so significantly,
you know,

747
00:41:41,661 --> 00:41:45,980
to to say in 2013 when the
discovery of the Higgs Boson,

748
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:49,430
actually the prediction of the Higgs
Boson was rewarded. And I ask people like,

749
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:51,220
how often throughout the day do you say,
oh,

750
00:41:51,230 --> 00:41:54,380
thank God for the Higgs Boson and like
at least the lighthouse get, you know,

751
00:41:54,381 --> 00:41:55,580
did something practical.

752
00:41:56,870 --> 00:41:59,900
And of course has been other controversies
with the Nobel prize. There's some, uh,

753
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:02,480
some examples,
I'm not commenting on any of them,

754
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:06,170
but just these are controversies that
have been aroused and some of the winners

755
00:42:06,171 --> 00:42:09,640
have been a little bit unsavory. This
is one of the most egregious examples.

756
00:42:09,650 --> 00:42:13,400
William Shockley who won the Nobel Prize
for the invention of the technology

757
00:42:13,401 --> 00:42:16,340
that you guys would not have jobs without,
namely the transistor.

758
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:20,960
He got the Nobel prize and yet he said
terrible things about eugenics and ideas

759
00:42:20,961 --> 00:42:23,120
for sterilization of African Americans.

760
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:26,150
And he thought that was a way
to increase the Iq of the world.

761
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:27,530
And he was one of these,
uh,

762
00:42:27,710 --> 00:42:30,860
actually he was studied in this
famous study called Turmans Termites,

763
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:34,190
a study of future Nobel Prize winners,
brilliant men in society.

764
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:37,700
And they want to see is
there a correlation between
Iq and the Nobel prize.

765
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:41,800
And he was one of the counter examples
because his Iq was below average or are

766
00:42:41,810 --> 00:42:45,410
about average. And, and so, and
yet he did win the Nobel prize.

767
00:42:45,650 --> 00:42:48,500
There was a famous book written about
him, so he was very generous. Uh,

768
00:42:48,530 --> 00:42:51,950
not with his money. Uh, putting his
money. He kept his money in the bank,

769
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:53,510
but he also kept other things in the bag.

770
00:42:53,530 --> 00:42:57,080
He was one of the first donors to
the famous Nobel Prize Sperm Bank,

771
00:42:57,410 --> 00:43:01,170
which is located in lovely San Diego
County. So you can come visit it. No, no,

772
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:03,800
it's not in existence anymore.
And when they went bankrupt,

773
00:43:03,801 --> 00:43:06,200
I guess nobody made any
withdrawals that we know about.

774
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:10,040
But this is all done in a
social engineering eugenics
thing that you would be

775
00:43:10,041 --> 00:43:13,130
put in jail to do nowadays.
So a, so that was, you know,

776
00:43:13,131 --> 00:43:15,560
another controversial example.
I'll hit other ones later,

777
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:17,270
but keep in mind the criteria,

778
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:21,320
the criteria that Alfred Nobel stipulated
a single person in the preceding year

779
00:43:21,321 --> 00:43:25,310
conferred the greatest benefit on mankind
for all the prizes, chemistry, physics,

780
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:26,144
physiology.

781
00:43:26,180 --> 00:43:30,560
The Nobel Prize in economics was added
60 years after the first Nobel prizes.

782
00:43:30,620 --> 00:43:35,420
So it wasn't part of Alfred Nobel's will
and is actually no longer called the

783
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:37,850
Nobel prize in economics. Someone
says, I won the Nobel prize in math.

784
00:43:38,030 --> 00:43:40,790
You know they're lying because there's
no such thing as a Nobel prize in math.

785
00:43:41,270 --> 00:43:45,070
And they also say I won the, I'm a noble
and won the Nobel Prize in economics,

786
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:47,060
actually called a much catchier name.

787
00:43:47,060 --> 00:43:50,510
Now it's called the Swedish Central Bank
prize and honor the memory of Alfred

788
00:43:50,510 --> 00:43:52,930
Nobel. So put that on
a tee shirt here. Yeah.

789
00:43:54,170 --> 00:43:59,000
So last year the Nobel prize was given
to the discovery of gravitational waves

790
00:43:59,001 --> 00:44:03,740
from the orbit of two black holes that
can crashing together about 1.3 billion

791
00:44:03,741 --> 00:44:05,120
light years away from Earth.

792
00:44:05,390 --> 00:44:09,380
The signals travel throughout the
universe or throughout from galaxy to our

793
00:44:09,381 --> 00:44:14,381
galaxy and were detected in September of
2015 and I want to take us through this

794
00:44:14,451 --> 00:44:17,810
example because what actually ended up
happening when the detection was made in

795
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:19,280
September,

796
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:22,790
2015 it was a billion years after more
than a billion years after the discovery

797
00:44:22,791 --> 00:44:23,930
of the actual event.

798
00:44:24,350 --> 00:44:27,980
What happened between then and and and
detection between the production of the

799
00:44:27,981 --> 00:44:28,814
black hole,

800
00:44:28,820 --> 00:44:33,820
a signal when these black holes crashed
and the eventual Nobel prize award is

801
00:44:34,021 --> 00:44:37,530
actually illustrative of
one of the biggest problems
I have with the Nobel prize

802
00:44:37,650 --> 00:44:42,300
that it can't be given away posthumously
these black holes were announced.

803
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:42,781
The detection,

804
00:44:42,781 --> 00:44:46,710
these black holes were announced about
11 days after the deadline for my

805
00:44:46,711 --> 00:44:51,711
nomination in 2016 so the j the January
deadline passed and you have to have

806
00:44:52,261 --> 00:44:56,010
your nominations in by the 31st of January
every year or else they'll just throw

807
00:44:56,011 --> 00:44:57,720
them away and they don't
save them for the next year.

808
00:44:58,980 --> 00:45:02,880
The Lygo announcement was not made in
the famous press conference in DC until

809
00:45:02,881 --> 00:45:05,250
the 11th of February,
so they missed that deadline.

810
00:45:05,251 --> 00:45:08,550
That means I could not nominate them.
I nominated somebody else and I,

811
00:45:08,551 --> 00:45:10,990
and I can invite you to guess who it was.
I,

812
00:45:11,210 --> 00:45:14,340
I trust you will not be able to guess
who it is, but I don't mention who I,

813
00:45:14,341 --> 00:45:15,210
who I nominated.

814
00:45:15,330 --> 00:45:18,000
But I didn't get to nominate these
people because they never made the

815
00:45:18,001 --> 00:45:20,160
announcement in time for
me to make the nomination.

816
00:45:20,820 --> 00:45:24,540
So they would have to wait till the next
year and all was fine except for the

817
00:45:24,541 --> 00:45:29,190
fact that one of the three
founding fathers of Lygo
Ronald Drever died on march

818
00:45:29,191 --> 00:45:34,191
seven 2017 that meant when Lygo actually
was awarded the Nobel prize in 2017 he

819
00:45:35,491 --> 00:45:37,260
was left out and another person,

820
00:45:37,261 --> 00:45:41,190
Barry Barish up at Caltech took his place
and even bearer said if they had given

821
00:45:41,191 --> 00:45:42,690
the prize away a year earlier,

822
00:45:42,691 --> 00:45:45,900
I would not have won it because the
Nobel prize can nowadays be one by up to

823
00:45:45,901 --> 00:45:48,330
three people.
Another rules change that they've made.

824
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:50,310
So what does this illustrate?

825
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:55,400
This means that if these black holes
had crashed together 11 days earlier and

826
00:45:56,101 --> 00:45:59,310
everything else in the history of the
universe proceeded at the same way,

827
00:45:59,311 --> 00:46:00,390
and there's no reason,
maybe they think,

828
00:46:00,391 --> 00:46:04,200
not that this man would have a
Nobel prize. And in fact, uh,

829
00:46:04,201 --> 00:46:06,390
and then the other men,
uh, Barry Barish would not,

830
00:46:06,660 --> 00:46:10,710
so it's so capricious because of this
rule that they made up themselves in 1974.

831
00:46:10,830 --> 00:46:12,420
No posthumous Nobel prizes.

832
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:15,210
And they actually have given it
away three times to three men.

833
00:46:15,660 --> 00:46:19,630
And I was talking about sexism in
the price in just a second, but, uh,

834
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:23,400
they give it away. The three men and two
of the three were Swedish men. Okay. So,

835
00:46:23,401 --> 00:46:24,650
uh,
so some people say there's,

836
00:46:24,651 --> 00:46:29,280
there's lots of forms of bias with
the Nobel prize. So, uh, uh, you know,

837
00:46:29,281 --> 00:46:32,970
sort of poor Ron drivers memory and
his family don't have this accolade to

838
00:46:32,971 --> 00:46:36,180
really look back on. Now this is going
to become a big problem. This, this,

839
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:36,841
this plat hair.

840
00:46:36,841 --> 00:46:40,190
I've been told you guys are very
quantitative and you eat up data. Um,

841
00:46:40,310 --> 00:46:42,640
like I'm going to eat up
lunch in a little bit. Uh,

842
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:47,720
this shows the long timescales between
the discovery of a Nobel worthy invention

843
00:46:48,931 --> 00:46:52,740
or discovery and the award for
several different branches of science,

844
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:55,470
fixating on physics.
These blue curves here,

845
00:46:56,400 --> 00:47:01,380
it shows that from the 19 hundreds up
to 2000 it's now getting up to about 30

846
00:47:01,381 --> 00:47:06,381
years plus between discovery of an effect
and the Nobel prize that's awarded for

847
00:47:06,751 --> 00:47:09,180
that discovery and what's not increasing.

848
00:47:09,181 --> 00:47:12,720
And then I made a plot in my book where
I took data from the Nobel Prize website

849
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:16,260
on the age of different people when
they won the Nobel prize in each decade.

850
00:47:16,380 --> 00:47:18,060
And I came up with this plot here.

851
00:47:19,350 --> 00:47:23,430
I say this plot here and it
shows that the early Nobel prize,

852
00:47:23,431 --> 00:47:24,600
the average age was in the,
you know,

853
00:47:24,601 --> 00:47:29,260
say 50s then it went down to 40 almost
and now it's been rising faster than a of

854
00:47:29,261 --> 00:47:33,220
years per decade. And a
couch are eventually going
to hit this deadline, right?

855
00:47:33,270 --> 00:47:34,840
Think so. There's not,
there's not too much.

856
00:47:34,870 --> 00:47:36,250
I mean maybe you guys can help with this,

857
00:47:36,370 --> 00:47:40,030
but eventually the average age of the
Nobel laureates this past year was 78

858
00:47:40,031 --> 00:47:44,890
years old. The three men average age 78
so this is going to become very serious.

859
00:47:44,891 --> 00:47:47,890
Where the passion is. Price is always
going to be given away. Unless you guys,

860
00:47:47,891 --> 00:47:50,530
and this could actually happen,
I predict in a few years,

861
00:47:50,531 --> 00:47:53,650
it could be that artificial
intelligence wins Nobel prizes. Why not?

862
00:47:53,890 --> 00:47:57,370
There's nothing. It says, it says the
person, well, they already gave up the,

863
00:47:57,610 --> 00:48:00,190
and so why can't they
give a person as well?

864
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:04,840
So I want to just point out a couple of
technicalities and this is who gets to

865
00:48:04,841 --> 00:48:07,540
nominate the winners of the Nobel prize.
You don't need to read,

866
00:48:07,541 --> 00:48:09,550
it's mostly Swedish Nordic,
Nordic people.

867
00:48:09,730 --> 00:48:12,130
And then down here there's people like me,

868
00:48:12,190 --> 00:48:14,620
people that the academy
sees fit to ask to nominate.

869
00:48:14,620 --> 00:48:17,590
So that was my category number
six in the pecking order.

870
00:48:17,710 --> 00:48:21,850
But notice number three in the pecking
order are Nobel laureates in physics.

871
00:48:21,910 --> 00:48:23,290
So if you win a Nobel prize,

872
00:48:23,291 --> 00:48:26,020
you're automatically entitled for the
rest of your life to nominate winners of

873
00:48:26,021 --> 00:48:28,720
the Nobel Prize.
And that has important ramifications.

874
00:48:28,721 --> 00:48:32,440
It turns out you're five times more
likely to win a Nobel prize if your phd

875
00:48:32,441 --> 00:48:36,550
advisor was a Nobel laureate or your
postdoctoral advisor was a Nobel laureate.

876
00:48:37,060 --> 00:48:38,920
And that's part of this,
this, this phenomenon.

877
00:48:40,030 --> 00:48:43,630
So a and that means it's harder to
break into that. Like if you're,

878
00:48:43,631 --> 00:48:46,900
if you're from a different group than
is traditionally been awarded the Nobel

879
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:49,150
prize to break into that,
whether women or minorities,

880
00:48:49,270 --> 00:48:53,770
it becomes harder and harder for them to
also get into this track where they can,

881
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:55,450
the rich can get richer so to speak.

882
00:48:56,410 --> 00:48:58,990
And they gave me the last piece
of helpful advice they gave me.

883
00:48:59,230 --> 00:49:00,640
No one can nominate him or herself.

884
00:49:00,641 --> 00:49:04,400
So that was helpful and not
narrowed it down by one person. Um,

885
00:49:04,450 --> 00:49:07,720
so I wasn't allowed to do that.
I want to talk briefly about this clause.

886
00:49:07,721 --> 00:49:11,830
This is actually the opening statement
of the Nobel Prize. Endowing will says,

887
00:49:11,831 --> 00:49:14,920
I Alfred Nobel do here by
after mature deliberation,

888
00:49:14,921 --> 00:49:19,300
declared my falling to my last will
and testament to my nephew [inaudible].

889
00:49:19,330 --> 00:49:20,111
I don't know how to pronounce that.

890
00:49:20,111 --> 00:49:25,060
And Ludvig I bequeath the sum of 200,000
Swedish crowns to my niece, Mina.

891
00:49:25,061 --> 00:49:28,770
I give 100,000 crowns so the men
got twice as much as the wind.

892
00:49:29,290 --> 00:49:32,440
Some people joke that this is the
root of the Nobel prizes sexism.

893
00:49:32,470 --> 00:49:34,270
I think it actually runs deeper than that.

894
00:49:34,390 --> 00:49:37,900
Nobody knows why he gave the women
the woman half as much as the men,

895
00:49:39,310 --> 00:49:42,340
but speaking of, you know,
half as much or two entities.

896
00:49:42,430 --> 00:49:46,000
These are all the women who have won the
Nobel Prize in physics. The first one,

897
00:49:46,001 --> 00:49:50,800
Marie Curie won it in early 19 hundreds
and she was almost denied it. In fact,

898
00:49:50,801 --> 00:49:53,980
they weren't going to give it to her
until her husband and Colorino and said,

899
00:49:53,981 --> 00:49:57,760
I'm not going to accept my prize for
radio activity unless you give it also to

900
00:49:57,761 --> 00:50:01,390
my wife, because she did most of the
work. So they ended up giving it to her,

901
00:50:01,510 --> 00:50:02,440
but it was grudgingly.

902
00:50:02,650 --> 00:50:06,820
And then Maria get bird Mayer who
is at Uc San Diego where I am,

903
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:12,000
she won the last Nobel Prize in physics
in 1963 54 years ago was the last woman

904
00:50:13,511 --> 00:50:17,640
to win the Nobel Prize and, and
physics. And when she wanted,

905
00:50:17,890 --> 00:50:22,270
she was only able to win it
after being nominated 27 times,

906
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:25,870
which is twice as many times as Albert
Einstein had to be nominated to win it.

907
00:50:25,990 --> 00:50:26,860
Why is that such a big,

908
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:31,190
Albert Einstein was forbidden almost
by the rules of the regulations of the

909
00:50:31,220 --> 00:50:34,400
early part of the 19 hundreds because
Jews weren't allowed to win it.

910
00:50:34,730 --> 00:50:38,150
And in fact, because previous winners
were allowed to nominate future winners,

911
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:41,450
and they were the part of the committee
that decided who wins the Nobel prize,

912
00:50:41,660 --> 00:50:45,770
they were including Hitler's chief of
Arion physics and man by the name of

913
00:50:45,771 --> 00:50:49,820
Phillip Lin art, who had won
the 19, uh, 1905 Nobel prize.

914
00:50:50,090 --> 00:50:53,720
He had a mandate that Einstein could
not win the Nobel Prize because he

915
00:50:53,721 --> 00:50:55,280
practiced theoretical physics,

916
00:50:55,610 --> 00:50:59,180
which was a form of world
bluffing Jewish physics.

917
00:50:59,450 --> 00:51:04,190
So Einstein was forbidden, but only for
15 years. Women have not won it in 50,

918
00:51:04,191 --> 00:51:04,371
you know,

919
00:51:04,371 --> 00:51:08,420
first it was they didn't win it and then
she had to be nominated 27 times before

920
00:51:08,421 --> 00:51:10,490
she actually wanted.
So it's just remarkable.

921
00:51:10,491 --> 00:51:13,700
And when she wanted in our
hometown paper in San Diego,

922
00:51:13,701 --> 00:51:16,880
the paper of record throughout the world,
the San Diego Union Tribune,

923
00:51:16,970 --> 00:51:20,300
the headline read San Diego,
housewife wins Nobel prize.

924
00:51:21,530 --> 00:51:25,730
That was the headline in October,
1963 just incredible.

925
00:51:25,940 --> 00:51:28,940
Here's a graph shows women a
fraction of women, you know,

926
00:51:28,941 --> 00:51:31,730
so there's only been two women that
want it. So I always joke, you know,

927
00:51:31,731 --> 00:51:35,360
that means that there's only two more
female Nobel Prize winners in physics than

928
00:51:35,361 --> 00:51:39,650
there have been female pope's. Okay.
Female Pope's people. Okay. All right.

929
00:51:40,820 --> 00:51:43,310
Um, so again, why could this be, well,

930
00:51:43,311 --> 00:51:46,700
one reason is this clause that previous
Nobel laureates can nominate future

931
00:51:46,701 --> 00:51:49,610
Nobel laureates and that could be
part of the reason that we have this.

932
00:51:49,611 --> 00:51:51,380
Of course I like to point out,
I don't know,

933
00:51:51,410 --> 00:51:55,350
I've been giving this talk a couple of
times to other other groups of people and

934
00:51:55,351 --> 00:51:57,440
I, and I keep showing this,
maybe you guys will get it,

935
00:51:57,530 --> 00:51:59,510
but the back of the Nobel prize medallion,

936
00:51:59,511 --> 00:52:02,360
if I turned my real Nobel prize
over here, no, if I fake one,

937
00:52:02,660 --> 00:52:04,070
you'll find two women,

938
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:08,870
Mother Nature and this God has known as
the genius of science and she's taking

939
00:52:08,871 --> 00:52:12,140
the veil off mother nature's
face. So that's pretty cool. Um,

940
00:52:12,170 --> 00:52:15,640
but I noticed that like what we really
have is that you have a picture depicting

941
00:52:15,650 --> 00:52:17,740
two women and they're kind of,
you know,

942
00:52:17,750 --> 00:52:20,180
wouldn't be having this conversation
unless there was a dude there.

943
00:52:20,420 --> 00:52:23,630
And so this is an example of a failure
of what's called the Bechdel test.

944
00:52:23,631 --> 00:52:27,020
If you guys know about that,
that's a very important scientific test.

945
00:52:27,170 --> 00:52:28,970
But it has actually
another example of that.

946
00:52:30,140 --> 00:52:34,970
So I wrote this book and part of the
book I joke is about idol worship. Uh,

947
00:52:34,971 --> 00:52:35,601
so in,

948
00:52:35,601 --> 00:52:38,690
in physics there is no greater stature
then you can have than to be a Nobel

949
00:52:38,691 --> 00:52:42,110
laureate. It's really something
that people aspire to. So much so.

950
00:52:42,111 --> 00:52:44,370
And I have no problems with
the people who have won it. A,

951
00:52:44,390 --> 00:52:47,960
it's more of the committee
and the structure and the
system that I believe has

952
00:52:47,961 --> 00:52:50,590
systemic problems that
are preventing, um, uh,

953
00:52:50,750 --> 00:52:55,430
the meritocratic award of prizes. And
maybe during Q and a, I can address those.

954
00:52:55,710 --> 00:52:59,600
This is a, uh, uh, a friend of
a former colleague at UC SD.

955
00:52:59,601 --> 00:53:03,710
This is professor Dunkin Haldane.
He ended up winning the 2016 Nobel Prize.

956
00:53:03,950 --> 00:53:07,850
The one that I was nominating a
winners of. I did not nominate him.

957
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:10,910
Do not tell him. Okay. I did
not nominate him, but he won.

958
00:53:11,030 --> 00:53:13,850
He actually won with one of my former
professors at Brown University,

959
00:53:13,851 --> 00:53:17,780
Michael Costa, let's, and
another gentleman and he
came back to UC SD that day.

960
00:53:17,781 --> 00:53:22,160
I submitted the first draft of this book,
losing the Nobel Prize. In this book,

961
00:53:22,190 --> 00:53:25,160
I decry how physicists elevate the Nobel,

962
00:53:25,580 --> 00:53:29,350
the status of idols that they
basically are willing to, to, you know,

963
00:53:29,370 --> 00:53:32,120
kind of sacrifice so much
and really to be an awe and,

964
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:35,400
and bask in the aura of the
laureates. And the Nobel prize. Look,

965
00:53:35,401 --> 00:53:37,570
I took this picture you can't hardly see.

966
00:53:37,570 --> 00:53:41,190
Then it glows with a white hot
intensity and it just has a super,

967
00:53:41,590 --> 00:53:44,580
super luminant glow to it.
And look how all these students,

968
00:53:44,581 --> 00:53:48,330
and then the faculty that came up to
him and they were oohing and aahing and

969
00:53:48,331 --> 00:53:52,160
just gushing over him. It was pathetic. I
was like, you guys are rational science.

970
00:53:52,161 --> 00:53:53,730
He supposed to be the most rational,
you know,

971
00:53:53,731 --> 00:53:58,080
critical thinkers in all of humanity. How
could you stoop solar? It's disgusting.

972
00:53:58,440 --> 00:54:03,390
Oh my God. Somehow the Nobel
prize gets in my hand selfie.

973
00:54:03,420 --> 00:54:07,130
Okay. Even I would have been given
this incredible, you know, uh,

974
00:54:07,131 --> 00:54:08,640
opportunity to a sale,

975
00:54:08,641 --> 00:54:12,690
the Nobel prize from the insides and
dissected and appoint out all of its flaws

976
00:54:12,850 --> 00:54:17,130
too to make it better. Uh, succumb to it.
And he's luckily a very wonderful man.

977
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:21,540
I want to close a talk with a couple
of points as to what will come next,

978
00:54:21,541 --> 00:54:24,330
both in cosmology and in the Nobel prize,
hopefully.

979
00:54:24,750 --> 00:54:28,800
So getting back to my theme, dust
to dust, we began or talk with dust.

980
00:54:29,070 --> 00:54:32,820
Dust came in as a villain,
but I want to point out a very noble,

981
00:54:32,830 --> 00:54:35,070
a person about an Ama,
Mahatma Gandhi.

982
00:54:35,430 --> 00:54:38,820
And he gave some advice to
experimentalists like me
in this story called the

983
00:54:38,821 --> 00:54:40,410
story of my experiments with truth.

984
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:44,070
Gandhi said the seeker after truth
should be humbler than the dust.

985
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:46,440
The world crushes dust under its feet.

986
00:54:46,740 --> 00:54:51,480
But the secret after truth should so
humble himself that even the dust could

987
00:54:51,481 --> 00:54:56,481
crush him only then and not until
then will he have a glimpse of truth.

988
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:00,510
And I think that's part of what we need
to have as cosmologist and as practicing

989
00:55:00,511 --> 00:55:01,650
scientist in general,

990
00:55:01,740 --> 00:55:05,970
to look for ways to be humble and have
humility in order to strive and make the,

991
00:55:06,100 --> 00:55:11,100
that make the great leads without
focusing on arbitrary awards or accolades,

992
00:55:11,131 --> 00:55:15,000
prizes, money, whatever you venerate
to the level of, of your idol.

993
00:55:16,500 --> 00:55:19,590
So what comes next in science
is a huge collaboration.

994
00:55:19,770 --> 00:55:22,920
BICEP had 49 people all, you know,
all of which would not have written,

995
00:55:22,970 --> 00:55:26,820
most of which would not have won the
Nobel prize even if we were confirmed. Uh,

996
00:55:26,821 --> 00:55:30,330
instead we have a much
bigger collaboration building
on the lessons of Bicep,

997
00:55:30,331 --> 00:55:31,320
I suppose,
not a failure.

998
00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:34,860
It was one of the most successful
experiments in history because it measured

999
00:55:34,861 --> 00:55:38,400
signals that are so minute
that no experiment has
caught up to what we did with

1000
00:55:38,401 --> 00:55:42,210
bicep even after four years after the uh,
announcement.

1001
00:55:42,660 --> 00:55:44,550
So we didn't retract them findings,

1002
00:55:44,551 --> 00:55:46,920
we retracted while we claimed
as the interpretation,

1003
00:55:46,921 --> 00:55:49,110
we said we saw the
fingerprints of creation,

1004
00:55:49,260 --> 00:55:53,010
we really saw the dusty fingerprints
of the Milky Way Galaxy.

1005
00:55:53,430 --> 00:55:54,990
So now we're taking lessons learned.

1006
00:55:54,991 --> 00:55:59,991
We're building this big observatory in
the Atacama desert of Chile called the

1007
00:56:00,090 --> 00:56:02,610
Simons Observatory.
And this telescope is going to be located,

1008
00:56:02,611 --> 00:56:05,250
here's a street view or Google
earth view for you guys out there.

1009
00:56:05,820 --> 00:56:09,360
And it shows kind of the killer app
for this technology is a new type of

1010
00:56:09,361 --> 00:56:12,180
detector, same kind of
superconducting instrumentation,

1011
00:56:12,330 --> 00:56:14,690
except that uses a
fractal pattern in tena.

1012
00:56:14,940 --> 00:56:18,480
And this fractal antenna has extremely
wide bandwidth frequency coverage.

1013
00:56:18,660 --> 00:56:22,560
So can simultaneously measure dust and
measure the cosmic signals if they're

1014
00:56:22,561 --> 00:56:26,170
truly, and then from the some of the
cosmic signal and the dust signal,

1015
00:56:26,290 --> 00:56:29,140
we're going to subtract the dust signal
and what will be left with hopefully as

1016
00:56:29,141 --> 00:56:32,980
the pristine signal from
the early universe. But we
won't know until we do it.

1017
00:56:33,790 --> 00:56:35,140
What's the other part of,
you know,

1018
00:56:35,141 --> 00:56:39,550
call to action next and the
Nobel kind of front? Well,

1019
00:56:39,551 --> 00:56:42,370
I want to close with the final
sentence and Alfred Nobel's will,

1020
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:47,740
he said is my final request that after
my death my veins shall be opened.

1021
00:56:48,070 --> 00:56:51,010
And when this has been done and competent
doctors have confirmed clear signs of

1022
00:56:51,011 --> 00:56:55,360
death, my remains to be cremated and our
crematorium, why did he want to do this?

1023
00:56:55,600 --> 00:56:58,660
Well, he was terribly afraid
of being buried alive.

1024
00:56:58,810 --> 00:57:02,800
It was a condition that
people were, that's called
tap a phobia. I googled that.

1025
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:06,220
And, and it means that you're
terrified of being buried alive.

1026
00:57:06,221 --> 00:57:10,210
So much so that in caskets they used
to put bells so that if you were buried

1027
00:57:10,211 --> 00:57:12,310
alive, you had this, you know,
intercom system and you could,

1028
00:57:12,311 --> 00:57:15,190
you could ring the bell and people would
open you up. But I like to point out,

1029
00:57:15,191 --> 00:57:18,550
you know, if he wasn't dead and
then the doctors opened his veins,

1030
00:57:18,610 --> 00:57:20,920
that would be kind of the, the
coup de Gras, right? So he,

1031
00:57:21,140 --> 00:57:23,950
he cure his tap a phobia right there.

1032
00:57:24,430 --> 00:57:28,000
But it made me think we should not be
scared of opening the veins on the prize

1033
00:57:28,001 --> 00:57:31,060
and really examining the depths
of what the prize is become.

1034
00:57:31,061 --> 00:57:33,820
So in the news just this week,
these are all headlines from this week.

1035
00:57:34,180 --> 00:57:38,520
Nobel prize is all over the headlines.
It's great publicity for my book. But um,

1036
00:57:38,830 --> 00:57:41,680
but there's a sex scandal rocking
the Nobel prize in literature.

1037
00:57:42,280 --> 00:57:46,360
There's a financial crimes unit,
which is investigating the Nobel,

1038
00:57:46,600 --> 00:57:51,400
the Nobel Committee's Donald Trump is in
the news for a potentially being worthy

1039
00:57:51,401 --> 00:57:54,160
of the Nobel prize for peace and a,

1040
00:57:54,161 --> 00:57:57,670
and then there's people that are defecting
from the Nobel committee because they

1041
00:57:57,671 --> 00:58:00,580
don't want to have a part of it anymore.
So it's a very dangerous time.

1042
00:58:00,610 --> 00:58:01,281
And I claim that,

1043
00:58:01,281 --> 00:58:05,200
that the committee wants to save these
prizes to restore them to the luster,

1044
00:58:05,201 --> 00:58:09,000
the lure that they once had and
the, you know, so if you do, um,

1045
00:58:09,370 --> 00:58:11,080
if you do one of your Google searches on,

1046
00:58:11,260 --> 00:58:14,200
on the search terms and their popularity
over history, what's that called again?

1047
00:58:15,100 --> 00:58:16,630
You guys shoot on Google trends.

1048
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:21,040
So I did a Google trends and I looked
up a Pulitzer prize versus Nobel prize.

1049
00:58:21,190 --> 00:58:23,160
It turned out for the early
part of the 19 hundreds,

1050
00:58:23,270 --> 00:58:26,110
the Pulitzer prize is much more
popular than the Nobel prize. In fact,

1051
00:58:26,111 --> 00:58:28,450
the first noble prizes, the winters
didn't even show up to get them.

1052
00:58:28,630 --> 00:58:32,050
Nowadays 100 million people watch
them on youtube and in person.

1053
00:58:32,530 --> 00:58:34,720
So they've gone just
exponentially more popular.

1054
00:58:34,721 --> 00:58:36,910
They're moving into this glitzy
new building in Stockholm.

1055
00:58:37,060 --> 00:58:40,030
It's billions of dollars at
stake and the national prestige.

1056
00:58:40,031 --> 00:58:43,380
So if they want to save it, I've
made some proposals in this book, uh,

1057
00:58:43,480 --> 00:58:46,180
that I think are very concrete,
very well organized.

1058
00:58:46,330 --> 00:58:48,070
I color coded the pages in the book.

1059
00:58:48,100 --> 00:58:51,640
There's three chapters about the Nobel
prize. So if you don't care about it,

1060
00:58:51,641 --> 00:58:54,460
you can skip those three colors in the
kind of choose your own adventure book

1061
00:58:54,461 --> 00:58:55,630
like we used to use as kids.

1062
00:58:56,260 --> 00:58:59,050
But I want to use the prestige and the
name of the prize to reform it for the

1063
00:58:59,051 --> 00:58:59,350
better.

1064
00:58:59,350 --> 00:59:04,350
So we've established a site which we
call when you call losing the Nobel

1065
00:59:04,421 --> 00:59:09,421
prize.org and it has the capacity to
submit petitions to the Nobel Committee's

1066
00:59:10,270 --> 00:59:13,480
to advocate for both
rectification of past prizes.

1067
00:59:13,660 --> 00:59:18,070
Say this is Jocelyn Bell who discovered
pulsars radio beacon. So bright.

1068
00:59:18,071 --> 00:59:20,800
You can set your watch to them
and see them across the galaxy.

1069
00:59:21,110 --> 00:59:24,980
Her advisor got the Nobel prize, but she
didn't. It's called the Matilda effect.

1070
00:59:25,190 --> 00:59:27,260
When a man gets a credit for
the discovery of a woman,

1071
00:59:27,500 --> 00:59:30,650
there's nothing in the Nobel statutes
that prevents her from winning the Nobel

1072
00:59:30,650 --> 00:59:30,770
prize.

1073
00:59:30,770 --> 00:59:33,500
Just because her advisor wanted it
would seem that if you want a justice to

1074
00:59:33,501 --> 00:59:35,030
prevail,
she shouldn't be allowed to win it.

1075
00:59:35,270 --> 00:59:38,900
Or what about Ron Drever who died and
didn't win it or beer or Ruben who died

1076
00:59:38,901 --> 00:59:43,190
just on Christmas Day 2016. Why shouldn't
she when it, when physicists say, well,

1077
00:59:43,191 --> 00:59:45,230
you couldn't, you can't win it
once you're dead. I say, Oh,

1078
00:59:45,231 --> 00:59:46,610
I forgot what law of physics.

1079
00:59:46,620 --> 00:59:50,060
He talks about that for the Nobel prize
and it doesn't and we shouldn't treat it

1080
00:59:50,061 --> 00:59:51,950
like a law of physics.
So I urge people,

1081
00:59:51,951 --> 00:59:55,250
if you're interested after reading
the book, um, go to the site,

1082
00:59:55,251 --> 00:59:56,580
losing the Nobel prize.org.

1083
00:59:56,581 --> 01:00:00,380
You can submit petitions and I thank you
so much for your attention and I hope

1084
01:00:00,381 --> 01:00:02,030
that you'll visit us on online as well.

1085
01:00:02,580 --> 01:00:03,413
Thank you.

1086
01:00:07,910 --> 01:00:11,280
Thank you so much Brian. That
was amazing. Um, it's, uh,

1087
01:00:11,330 --> 01:00:14,450
we're a little bit after time,
but if anyone wants to ask a question,

1088
01:00:14,660 --> 01:00:17,240
we have the ability to do that.
So just raise your hand.

1089
01:00:17,241 --> 01:00:18,290
I can throw something at you.

1090
01:00:23,870 --> 01:00:24,141
Uh,

1091
01:00:24,141 --> 01:00:29,141
so it seems like the early universe has
a lot of quantum chaotic effects in it.

1092
01:00:30,070 --> 01:00:34,970
Do you ever see that it's perceivable
to simulate potentially with a quantum

1093
01:00:34,971 --> 01:00:37,070
computer or the evolution of the universe?

1094
01:00:37,140 --> 01:00:41,640
Yeah. So yeah. So is it possible to
simulate? So it turns out in physics,

1095
01:00:41,641 --> 01:00:43,980
most of my colleagues,
um, and friends who,

1096
01:00:43,981 --> 01:00:48,860
including a professor John Presto up at
Caltech here and people in San Diego, um,

1097
01:00:48,930 --> 01:00:51,800
they tell me that a lot of the, the,
the power of a quantum computer,

1098
01:00:51,810 --> 01:00:53,640
at least in her,
in terms of solving practical problems,

1099
01:00:53,910 --> 01:00:55,690
are toward solving quantum systems.

1100
01:00:55,691 --> 01:00:58,410
So solving Lagrand Jan's or things
that are really complicated,

1101
01:00:58,411 --> 01:01:00,710
quantum mechanical, um, uh,

1102
01:01:00,900 --> 01:01:04,050
variables and plotting wave
functions and things like that.

1103
01:01:04,260 --> 01:01:07,860
So if indeed the universe is described
by a wave function or what's called

1104
01:01:07,950 --> 01:01:11,400
[inaudible] that describes how the
energy and transfer of energy took place,

1105
01:01:11,580 --> 01:01:12,091
then yes,

1106
01:01:12,091 --> 01:01:15,390
quantum computers could have a
revolutionary capability to understand it.

1107
01:01:15,660 --> 01:01:16,560
I should say though,

1108
01:01:16,680 --> 01:01:20,670
that there's a divisiveness
in the cosmology community
right now and it's every

1109
01:01:20,671 --> 01:01:24,720
bit as combatitive as the old debate
between the steady state universe and the

1110
01:01:24,721 --> 01:01:26,310
Big Bang theory. So, you know,

1111
01:01:26,311 --> 01:01:28,650
we don't have a TV show called
the steady state theory, right?

1112
01:01:28,651 --> 01:01:31,760
So we have the Big Bang theory
that would be pretty boring. Uh,

1113
01:01:31,800 --> 01:01:32,720
but the steady state there,

1114
01:01:32,721 --> 01:01:35,370
she used to hate the Big Bang
theory is for a variety of reasons,

1115
01:01:35,520 --> 01:01:37,980
but one of which was that you
couldn't falsify the big bang.

1116
01:01:37,981 --> 01:01:40,890
You could keep changing the models of the
proud owners of the theory in order to

1117
01:01:40,891 --> 01:01:41,431
get what you want.

1118
01:01:41,431 --> 01:01:45,690
It nowadays are echoes of that debate
and what's called the multiverse,

1119
01:01:45,900 --> 01:01:49,580
which is a consequence of inflation
and in many models of the inflationary

1120
01:01:49,590 --> 01:01:50,250
universe.

1121
01:01:50,250 --> 01:01:54,240
And there's a new type of a variant of
the steady state called sick lick or

1122
01:01:54,241 --> 01:01:57,990
bouncing cosmologies where our
universe didn't have a quantum state.

1123
01:01:58,020 --> 01:02:01,770
It actually just collapsed from a
previous universe. Expanded again,

1124
01:02:01,890 --> 01:02:04,200
what we call that expansion
point is the big bang,

1125
01:02:04,320 --> 01:02:05,820
but there's no quantum transition.

1126
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:09,600
So in those universes there's only
classical physics at work and in that case

1127
01:02:09,601 --> 01:02:12,360
our classical computers are
sufficient to deal with that physics.

1128
01:02:13,690 --> 01:02:15,400
But nobody's simulated that.
Right.

1129
01:02:15,540 --> 01:02:17,460
I think people are now,
there are people that are doing it.

1130
01:02:17,461 --> 01:02:21,820
They're also simulating a, I I've seen
on classical computer simulations of um,

1131
01:02:21,860 --> 01:02:23,820
you know, it's called quantum
chromo dynamic effects,

1132
01:02:24,360 --> 01:02:27,720
the vacuum and actually understanding
how particles can pop out virtually and

1133
01:02:27,721 --> 01:02:31,020
the vacuum. And I think it's just a
matter of time before the first step,

1134
01:02:31,021 --> 01:02:32,420
in my opinion, will probably be, I mean,

1135
01:02:32,430 --> 01:02:34,140
somebody out there might
already be doing this,

1136
01:02:34,290 --> 01:02:38,190
but first use quantum computers on the
QCD Lagrand Geans and then transferred to

1137
01:02:38,191 --> 01:02:42,000
the vacuum state of the inflationary at
park. I think it's eminently possible.

1138
01:02:42,420 --> 01:02:44,550
I hadn't thought of that.
It's a really good point.

1139
01:02:46,130 --> 01:02:47,610
Yeah.
Couple of questions.

1140
01:02:52,650 --> 01:02:57,030
So you talked about the pressure to
get scientific results out there,

1141
01:02:57,031 --> 01:03:01,560
to have these major impact,
uh, press conferences.

1142
01:03:02,250 --> 01:03:06,060
And it seems that that
was part of the issue.

1143
01:03:06,090 --> 01:03:11,090
Have you given a thought to
reforming that process as well?

1144
01:03:11,350 --> 01:03:15,730
Yeah, so I've, I've thought
a lot about that. And, um,
I was gratified to see that,

1145
01:03:15,731 --> 01:03:16,031
you know,

1146
01:03:16,031 --> 01:03:19,150
and my colleagues that are in the medical
school or law schools or whatever,

1147
01:03:19,330 --> 01:03:22,910
they have to take classes in ethics
and that's part of the curriculum. And,

1148
01:03:23,010 --> 01:03:26,330
and even, um, and even people
that are, you know, in,

1149
01:03:26,480 --> 01:03:30,640
in university settings and other cases
that may, we'll study ethic ethics, but a,

1150
01:03:30,641 --> 01:03:33,580
in physics and cosmology,
I never have class in ethics.

1151
01:03:34,090 --> 01:03:37,050
They barely teach us how
to be a professor. So, um,

1152
01:03:37,090 --> 01:03:40,780
so what I would like to see is the
ethical implications of making it an

1153
01:03:40,781 --> 01:03:44,560
announcement like this. It could have
potentially impacted very young people,

1154
01:03:44,561 --> 01:03:48,040
graduate students and post docs, and
then the, the notion of the retraction.

1155
01:03:48,041 --> 01:03:51,670
And then oftentimes you hear something
called like the Keating effect and then

1156
01:03:51,671 --> 01:03:54,730
it's debunked. And then there'll be, you
know, Keating's ground students, you know,

1157
01:03:54,731 --> 01:03:58,030
so you'll get the name transfer
and they'll be the, the,
the Grad student blunder.

1158
01:03:58,030 --> 01:04:01,870
Okay. Um, my Grad students never make
blunders. Uh, but, but nevertheless,

1159
01:04:02,080 --> 01:04:06,550
a lot of times the power hierarchy must
be preserved. And I think the, the, the,

1160
01:04:06,580 --> 01:04:11,320
the perception of science as being
purely meritocratic error correcting,

1161
01:04:11,560 --> 01:04:13,810
I think it,
I think it's a little bit bogus.

1162
01:04:13,811 --> 01:04:17,380
I think that scientists are a
little bit too, too full of,

1163
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:21,340
of how they view themselves as, you know,
it's kind of like, well, ethics are easy.

1164
01:04:21,430 --> 01:04:24,550
You know, we're really smart. We have high
qs, you know, we give this burn back. No,

1165
01:04:24,551 --> 01:04:28,600
we don't do that, but, but, um, but, you
know, we can, we can intuit these laws,

1166
01:04:28,601 --> 01:04:31,590
but I don't think so. I think, you
know, so we're actually having a, uh,

1167
01:04:31,620 --> 01:04:36,480
a play done in San Diego, uh, by the,
uh, by the, the Department of, of,

1168
01:04:36,510 --> 01:04:39,550
of theaters putting on a play
about an ethical dilemma faced by,

1169
01:04:39,560 --> 01:04:43,480
and I had nothing to do with this by a
physicist who's on the verge of winning a

1170
01:04:43,480 --> 01:04:44,111
Nobel prize.
I always point out,

1171
01:04:44,111 --> 01:04:47,410
I think it'd be a really cool play or
book and maybe there'll be my next book.

1172
01:04:47,610 --> 01:04:51,480
Um, you know, there's four Nobel
worthy discoverers of some, you know,

1173
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:53,560
cure for cancer or whatever.
And then you know,

1174
01:04:53,650 --> 01:04:55,840
it's a murder mystery because
only three can win it. Right?

1175
01:04:55,841 --> 01:04:58,960
So how do you deal with these issues
of credit of priority in science?

1176
01:04:58,961 --> 01:05:01,600
It's citations. You guys know
this, this Google scholar,

1177
01:05:01,630 --> 01:05:04,300
it's one of the tools we use
every single day. And you know,

1178
01:05:04,330 --> 01:05:05,980
how do you determine who got there first?

1179
01:05:05,981 --> 01:05:08,680
It's who wrote the first paper and
who made the first announcement.

1180
01:05:08,681 --> 01:05:11,560
And a lot of journals like nature
and science won't allow you to,

1181
01:05:11,561 --> 01:05:14,980
to do a press conference until you've
had peer review. We bypass that and we,

1182
01:05:14,981 --> 01:05:19,090
we open sourced it thinking that high
time that we get away from the Stodgy old

1183
01:05:19,091 --> 01:05:20,980
journal system that's
been around for 200 years.

1184
01:05:21,340 --> 01:05:24,220
It probably would have been better
if we had brought in at least,

1185
01:05:24,221 --> 01:05:26,200
if not an ethical kind of consultants,

1186
01:05:26,350 --> 01:05:29,900
but even bringing in your competitors
because they're not going to scoop you.

1187
01:05:29,901 --> 01:05:32,490
And all in a day or two
before the results, sit down,

1188
01:05:32,500 --> 01:05:37,150
talk about them that it air your dirty
laundry and do so in the scheme of what

1189
01:05:37,151 --> 01:05:39,420
we ended up doing,
which is to understand the universe,

1190
01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:41,830
we actually ended up working with
our arch nemesis at the time,

1191
01:05:42,220 --> 01:05:43,450
which is this Planck satellite.

1192
01:05:43,600 --> 01:05:45,860
Yeah.
Yeah.

1193
01:05:49,290 --> 01:05:52,560
Okay. So my question is related to
that question. Okay. So I want to know,

1194
01:05:52,561 --> 01:05:56,310
what do you think about the true
impact of Nobel Prize and science?

1195
01:05:56,340 --> 01:06:00,330
Like would there be less or
more scientific advancement
if there was no Nobel

1196
01:06:00,331 --> 01:06:01,900
prize? Yeah, it's interesting.

1197
01:06:01,900 --> 01:06:04,480
So I've been getting two different
types of comments. One is that Oh,

1198
01:06:04,481 --> 01:06:06,700
you have sour grapes,
you're a sore loser.

1199
01:06:07,080 --> 01:06:10,060
And I point out where like a lot of the
book is written about women in science

1200
01:06:10,061 --> 01:06:13,620
and minorities in science
and you know, I'm not a woman
in science, right? So, and,

1201
01:06:13,621 --> 01:06:17,410
and kind of advocating for past
injustices to be rectified. Um,

1202
01:06:17,470 --> 01:06:20,230
and then a lot of other things are saying,
well no, the number Keating's right.

1203
01:06:20,350 --> 01:06:23,080
Cause the Nobel prize is
so superlative that people,

1204
01:06:23,081 --> 01:06:26,930
even than last year's Nobel Prize
winner, he called the Nobel Prize, uh,

1205
01:06:26,980 --> 01:06:29,770
the original sin in physics.
In other words,

1206
01:06:29,771 --> 01:06:33,610
it was the thing that was responsible for
making so many premature announcements

1207
01:06:33,611 --> 01:06:36,220
about discoveries of
gravitational waves earlier,

1208
01:06:36,250 --> 01:06:40,210
even earlier than our discovery
in the 70s. And so, um,

1209
01:06:40,300 --> 01:06:42,880
and then there are people that say,
you know, they really do venerate.

1210
01:06:42,881 --> 01:06:45,540
I mean we're taught, I was talking
with, with Keith, I think about it,

1211
01:06:45,660 --> 01:06:48,640
we're taught the history of
physics really. We don't know it.

1212
01:06:48,910 --> 01:06:51,640
And when I teach my undergraduates,
I'm, I'm, I'm teaching them here,

1213
01:06:51,650 --> 01:06:54,710
all these Nobel worthy, you know,
things that we discovered, you know,

1214
01:06:54,730 --> 01:06:57,970
that's not my intention. I just say, well,
here's the Michelson Morley a factor.

1215
01:06:57,971 --> 01:07:00,480
Here's the, you know, Fineman
path or girl effect. And,

1216
01:07:00,481 --> 01:07:03,040
and I go through it and then you look
back and say, all those are Nobel prize.

1217
01:07:03,130 --> 01:07:06,310
But that's not the way science goes.
Science proceeds forward in history,

1218
01:07:06,550 --> 01:07:10,090
looking back in history. Okay, that was a
wrong turn that they could have avoided.

1219
01:07:10,210 --> 01:07:14,680
So I think there is this excess elephant
emphasis placed on the Nobel prize.

1220
01:07:14,860 --> 01:07:17,080
I think many scientists much more,
you know,

1221
01:07:17,081 --> 01:07:19,860
a kind of even killed them than myself.
They're able to,

1222
01:07:19,861 --> 01:07:22,690
to not even care about it. And that's
kind of the place that I'm at now.

1223
01:07:22,691 --> 01:07:26,170
People say, well you wouldn't, you know,
you, you and turn it down and I say,

1224
01:07:26,171 --> 01:07:29,710
well try me. You want to see
if I'm sincere offered me
the Nobel prize next year.

1225
01:07:30,910 --> 01:07:33,040
But in reality,
I think it influences some people.

1226
01:07:33,041 --> 01:07:35,920
Just like I always say the Academy Awards,

1227
01:07:36,010 --> 01:07:37,840
I don't think you guys are
here in Hollywood area, right?

1228
01:07:37,841 --> 01:07:39,520
So I don't think any
actor or actress says,

1229
01:07:39,521 --> 01:07:41,800
my whole goal in life is to win an Oscar.
Cause you know,

1230
01:07:41,801 --> 01:07:45,370
you're going to be one of
150 million women that could
win the ask her each year.

1231
01:07:45,670 --> 01:07:48,730
But the, you better believe that the
movie studios wants you to win an Oscar.

1232
01:07:48,731 --> 01:07:50,620
And they want every single,
you know, except for, you know,

1233
01:07:50,950 --> 01:07:54,070
whatever weekend at Bernie's nine.
But, but you know, they invest in it.

1234
01:07:54,071 --> 01:07:57,580
And B and g, who are the analogs
of the movie studios in science,

1235
01:07:57,760 --> 01:08:01,150
the National Science Foundation, NASA, the
Department of Energy, the not, you know,

1236
01:08:01,330 --> 01:08:04,120
so all these three letter
agencies for later, they all want,

1237
01:08:04,121 --> 01:08:06,600
and if you go to their websites and
Google on their websites to see,

1238
01:08:06,601 --> 01:08:10,000
you'll find it instantaneously. Here are
all the Nobel laureates and including,

1239
01:08:10,020 --> 01:08:13,660
you know, places like laboratories and
private industries. So it's a very big,

1240
01:08:13,661 --> 01:08:16,010
it's a subtle pressure
and definitely receive it.

1241
01:08:17,720 --> 01:08:19,820
I think that's all we have. Time
for it. Thank you very much.

1242
01:08:19,821 --> 01:08:23,400
Thank you guys for coming.
