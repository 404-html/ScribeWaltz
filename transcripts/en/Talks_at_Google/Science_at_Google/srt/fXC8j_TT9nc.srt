1
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:11,580
Hello, good morning. Good
afternoon and welcome. Welcome.

2
00:00:11,581 --> 00:00:13,650
If you're dialing in from
somewhere across the world,

3
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,180
very excited to have our guests here
today and to talk about one of the areas

4
00:00:18,181 --> 00:00:22,060
were completely different
disciplines are coming together, uh,

5
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:26,280
to make leaps in science
and in creativity. So, um,

6
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:28,830
I'm going to introduce our guests and
they're gonna share a little bit about

7
00:00:28,831 --> 00:00:30,720
some of the stuff we've
been doing together and then
we're going to try and have

8
00:00:30,721 --> 00:00:33,060
a conversation hopefully involving,
uh,

9
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:37,260
those of you in the room as
well about what's been going
on. Um, I'm Matt Britain.

10
00:00:37,261 --> 00:00:40,500
If you don't know me, look off to Google
business and operations in Europe,

11
00:00:40,501 --> 00:00:44,430
Middle East and Africa and wearing a
suit. A, that's part of what I have to do.

12
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:48,040
Apologies. Um, I first met, uh,

13
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:51,870
the team at the Natural History Museum
in my day job about eight years ago, uh,

14
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:54,840
when I was running our UK business and
they were talking about what can we do

15
00:00:54,841 --> 00:00:58,350
with our collection in the digital world.
There's probably something there now.

16
00:00:58,351 --> 00:01:02,430
It's taken them and us a bit of
time to get our stuff together. Uh,

17
00:01:02,431 --> 00:01:04,260
but over a 10 month period,

18
00:01:04,261 --> 00:01:07,950
the team led by the cultural
institutes and uh, say, uh,

19
00:01:07,951 --> 00:01:12,360
his who his hair and armpit and team
work with about a hundred different teams

20
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:16,740
to people from teams across Google to
help to digitize a whole bunch of natural

21
00:01:16,741 --> 00:01:19,440
history, uh, not just from
the natural history museum,

22
00:01:19,441 --> 00:01:24,300
but from 60 different
museums. Uh, 300,000 photos,

23
00:01:24,301 --> 00:01:28,650
videos and documents from those museums
as part of Google Arts and culture.

24
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,590
And we're going to have a little bit
of a look at some of that later in the

25
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:35,870
natural history museum was a primary
partner and our guests today, uh,

26
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:40,770
Eno ins who's here, uh, is, uh, leading
the natural history museums work,

27
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:44,280
um, uh, joined them from
Imperial College. Uh,

28
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:46,740
he's previously been
institute of Zoology in uh,

29
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:51,420
in Queensland final of
Queensland in Australia, the
Zoological Society of London.

30
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:55,260
He's a research fellow there. Uh,
he sits on the natural environment.

31
00:01:55,261 --> 00:01:58,500
Research Council is post genomics and
protein. I don't even know where that is.

32
00:01:58,501 --> 00:02:01,230
Proteomics. We'll find out
about that steering committee.

33
00:02:01,231 --> 00:02:04,660
A vice president of the council, the
British trust for ornithology atrocity,

34
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:07,440
the national biodiversity,
a network,

35
00:02:07,441 --> 00:02:10,860
and you oversee the work of 300
different scientists and a huge,

36
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:13,650
a collection of 70 million
different specimens.

37
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:17,160
And we might talk a bit about that as
well as write your CV so long that I won't

38
00:02:17,161 --> 00:02:19,290
go through it. You don't mind. Um,

39
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,450
there are lots of other things I
don't understand on it as well.

40
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:24,960
And then Vince who's here,
uh,

41
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:29,550
started as an evolutionary biologist
and is really leading the application of

42
00:02:29,551 --> 00:02:34,551
digital technologies to the study and
taxonomy of biodiversity and he's head of

43
00:02:35,071 --> 00:02:37,470
informatics at the Natural History Museum.

44
00:02:37,471 --> 00:02:41,100
That's probably not a role that was around
when it was founded back in the day.

45
00:02:41,101 --> 00:02:42,690
So we might talk about that as well.

46
00:02:42,691 --> 00:02:47,040
But first can I invite Ian to just share
a little bit about the work that you've

47
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:48,810
been doing and then we'll have a chat.

48
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:51,610
Sure. So I don't want this
to turn into a lecture.

49
00:02:51,611 --> 00:02:55,990
I was in universities for 20 years, so I
was warning Matt. I am prone to that. Um,

50
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:59,080
but hopefully you've all, you all
know about the natural history museum.

51
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,330
One of the pleasures of working here,
you show this sort of image,

52
00:03:01,331 --> 00:03:04,180
you say where you're from.
It's got a big brand globally,

53
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:06,710
about 5 million people come here,

54
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:11,050
here physically about the same number
of visitor exhibitions around the world

55
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:15,370
and about double that visitors digitally
at the moment. So it's got a big brand.

56
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:17,450
Now this place was founded.
Why?

57
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:22,490
It's based on a collection from
that was started in the 16 hundreds.

58
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,700
It started as the British Museum.

59
00:03:24,701 --> 00:03:28,810
So it was very much a product
of the age of reason. Um,

60
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:33,040
people coming out of a period when the
mythology and religion with the dominant

61
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:34,720
and ways of understanding the world,

62
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:38,340
these sorts of institutions were
really created to start to um,

63
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,480
talk about the world
rationally and explain it.

64
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,750
Cause one of the key parts of that
was to find objects around the world,

65
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:47,860
bring them to a big hub,
actually show them to sue people.

66
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:51,160
So we've got a few slides here we
can dip in and out of these arm,

67
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:52,180
go through a few of them.

68
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:56,650
This is what if you think about the big
hall at the Front of the Natural History

69
00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:59,560
Museum, this is what's on the
ceiling is absolutely beautiful.

70
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:03,040
This actually tells a quite an
important point about our founding.

71
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:07,930
This is a whole series of plants which
are of industrial or medical importance.

72
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:13,120
So these sorts of institutions
were founded partly out
of raw curiosity for the

73
00:04:13,121 --> 00:04:15,670
natural world. And particularly with
the history of the natural world.

74
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,500
They were all there were always intended
also to be a tool for exploration in

75
00:04:20,501 --> 00:04:24,070
terms of innovation as well. So
things like cocoa plants, coffee,

76
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:27,850
potatoes and so on. They all came
through these sorts of institutions.

77
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:30,490
The other thing,
of course,

78
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:34,780
these institutions contain some
unbelievably cool objects that have really

79
00:04:34,781 --> 00:04:37,070
changed the way that individuals have,
have,

80
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:39,790
have affected how we all
think about the world here.

81
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:42,790
So on the left here and once, some
of my favorite specimens, those, uh,

82
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,970
those aren't just what we always joke
there was that aren't just any Darwin's

83
00:04:45,971 --> 00:04:48,610
finches.
There was a Darwin's Darwin's finches.

84
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:52,960
So these are the sorts of objects that
really started making us think about, um,

85
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:56,470
evolution and natural selection.
That Brown object at the top,

86
00:04:56,471 --> 00:05:00,040
that is the first bit of dinosaur that
somebody dug up and figured out what it

87
00:05:00,041 --> 00:05:04,150
was. There was a really nice story about,
they realize, my goodness, it's a lizard,

88
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:06,640
but it's the lizard that's
about 30 meters long.

89
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:09,880
So that's the first dinosaur bottom there.

90
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:14,080
That's the first non human human
that we dug up from Gibraltar.

91
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:18,100
When people started figuring out there
were other humans around at some stage.

92
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:22,420
And if you think about what that meant
back in that time, we were the only human,

93
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:25,900
the world that only been around a few
thousand years of power to suddenly say

94
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:29,770
unambiguously and to show there were
other humans around. That was a rev,

95
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:32,980
intellectually revolutionary
moment. Um, I know over here,

96
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:35,530
Vince will probably talk about
this. This is, um, this is,

97
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:37,750
we have the thing that it
says, one of them got up, um,

98
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:42,970
the Galapagos mockingbirds actually it's
these specimens rather than the finches

99
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:45,970
that Darwin actually started
thinking about evolution.

100
00:05:45,971 --> 00:05:47,380
He actually collected these things.

101
00:05:47,381 --> 00:05:51,640
And the next day in his notebook when
he wasn't being sick, I'm in the Beagle,

102
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:55,960
he started to write a little what we
would now call trees of life and say,

103
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:59,210
I think things change.
So when you put these in front of people,

104
00:05:59,211 --> 00:06:01,670
as we do both physically and
now through the institute,

105
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:05,930
you can always captivate people first of
all about the object and then about the

106
00:06:05,931 --> 00:06:07,970
people.
But then it's the big idea.

107
00:06:07,971 --> 00:06:12,260
And of course what we're interested in
at the moment is it's no longer necessary

108
00:06:12,261 --> 00:06:16,250
to bring people to that
institution in South Kensington.

109
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:19,970
We want this to be available
to anybody anytime, anywhere.

110
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:23,000
And that's all about digital
and genomic technologies.

111
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:26,650
You want me to just
keep going for a minute?

112
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:30,830
I or maybe a couple of these here
are some of the sorts of specimens.

113
00:06:30,831 --> 00:06:35,480
Are there sort of data that we work with?
Huge collections of insects, 27 million,

114
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,630
um, pin insects. It's Pr.
I always check with Vince.

115
00:06:38,631 --> 00:06:41,870
It's probably the most analog thing
that I know. Who in the world,

116
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:44,100
if you want to get the, these, these, um,

117
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:48,260
insects have been incredibly
important in demonstrating, um,

118
00:06:48,261 --> 00:06:49,190
climate change.

119
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:53,990
If you want to know what some one of
those labels and the data behind that you

120
00:06:53,991 --> 00:06:58,190
have to go to that object will lift up
the specimen and write it out yourself.

121
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:00,110
It's an amazingly analog system.

122
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:03,320
It's been like that for
let's say 250 years.

123
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:08,330
Our job is to destroy that intellectual
model and to make that information

124
00:07:08,331 --> 00:07:12,110
freely available. I could see, you know,
you, you've barcoded them now. Yeah.

125
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:15,200
So this is, we've, we've um, had
a project where we've bark out,

126
00:07:15,201 --> 00:07:18,830
we've now digitized, um, the
UK lepidoptera collections,

127
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:23,780
that's butterflies and moths, two words.
That's about 800,000 specimens. Um,

128
00:07:23,781 --> 00:07:25,490
it was a demonstration project to say,

129
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:28,790
to show that this can be done and these
are the sorts of pipelines that you need

130
00:07:28,791 --> 00:07:30,980
to set up, um, to do it. So yes,

131
00:07:30,981 --> 00:07:34,610
that database is on the best
place to get to that database,

132
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:37,640
to that data at the moment would be
through the Google Cultural Institute.

133
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:41,920
300,000 of them are on
there. So we've started, um,

134
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:45,800
digitizing some of our collections.
This also shows, so for example,

135
00:07:45,801 --> 00:07:48,140
with the recent Ebola outbreaks,

136
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:51,350
one of the first things you need to figure
out for something like Ebola is where

137
00:07:51,351 --> 00:07:52,184
did it come from?

138
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:56,090
Almost everything that will really
kill humans on a large scale is leaping

139
00:07:56,091 --> 00:07:59,660
across the humans from something
else, relatively recently, Ebola,

140
00:07:59,661 --> 00:08:03,230
as an example of that. So when you try
and figure out where that comes from, you,

141
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:07,040
you realize it's from the fruit
bats that live in that area.

142
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:08,870
And you go back into
the collection and say,

143
00:08:08,871 --> 00:08:10,850
how long is a bowl of
being in these fruit bats?

144
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:14,510
You can use genetic techniques to extract
that. So sometimes it's unexpected.

145
00:08:14,511 --> 00:08:17,870
It's not always systematic digitization,
sometimes other things like that.

146
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:22,310
Um, uh, drew might, um,

147
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:26,750
drew pervs is hair from the mindset and
Andrew probably recognizes this year,

148
00:08:26,751 --> 00:08:29,210
a collaborator collaborator
in this project, aren't you?

149
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:31,550
This is a big project
called them predicts.

150
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:35,660
This is trying to mobilize the sort of
data we've just been looking at to first

151
00:08:35,661 --> 00:08:40,480
of all, map biodiversity in the
world. Now then figure out, um,

152
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:41,660
what our impact,

153
00:08:41,661 --> 00:08:45,710
what humanities impact has been on that
by diversity and then predict the future.

154
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:49,280
So that's something that we're really
interested in because we want to give

155
00:08:49,281 --> 00:08:53,390
people hope about the future as well as
making them realize that there's some

156
00:08:53,391 --> 00:08:56,340
big decisions to be made and that sort
of analysis that these guys have been

157
00:08:56,341 --> 00:08:57,390
doing,
um,

158
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:00,780
demonstrate that the decisions we in right
now could I have a really big impact,

159
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:03,990
not just over the next hundred years,
for the next 50 years,

160
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:08,040
but they are very data intensive compared
to the sorts of studies that people

161
00:09:08,041 --> 00:09:12,060
used to do before on here. Um,
we calculated the other day,

162
00:09:12,061 --> 00:09:17,061
there's the prevalence of about 65
million individual animals labeled on this

163
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:18,780
map.
So that's,

164
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:21,960
and that's the sort of data that you
need in the natural history collections

165
00:09:21,961 --> 00:09:22,794
around the world.

166
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:27,660
There's probably between about one and
a half and 3 billion data points just

167
00:09:27,661 --> 00:09:29,970
from the specimens.
That's not even going into the literature.

168
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:36,120
Okay. I'll probably stop on this slide.
This is where the challenges start.

169
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:37,650
So what we can do at the moment,

170
00:09:37,651 --> 00:09:42,360
we feel that we know roughly what we
want to do and we have some pipelines set

171
00:09:42,361 --> 00:09:46,590
up for doing that, be they physical or
infomatic. It's really scaling that up.

172
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,500
So at the moment we're doing a
few hundred thousand specimens.

173
00:09:49,501 --> 00:09:54,390
I think on the Google Cultural Institute
today, there's about 300,000 specimens.

174
00:09:54,391 --> 00:09:56,610
That's a lot compared to what
museums have done before,

175
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:01,140
but if we're trying to get into
the millions and the high millions,

176
00:10:01,141 --> 00:10:05,520
you need to really scale that. Then
that really becomes an informatic issue.

177
00:10:05,521 --> 00:10:06,680
This is a great example of this.

178
00:10:06,681 --> 00:10:11,670
This is about as bad as the collections
get in terms of hard to change anything

179
00:10:11,671 --> 00:10:14,820
from analog into digital.
Here's a typical curator.

180
00:10:14,821 --> 00:10:19,080
This is Max Barclay in charge of our
beetle collection. Fascinating stories,

181
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:21,420
sort of his collection
laid out in front of him.

182
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:23,760
If you actually go and look
at one of those objects,

183
00:10:23,761 --> 00:10:26,580
they're quite often like that.
So you can see in this case,

184
00:10:26,581 --> 00:10:30,360
a fly at the top there and then he can
see that set of labels underneath it.

185
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:35,700
That's the metadata in many cases were
much more interested in that data than we

186
00:10:35,701 --> 00:10:38,460
are to be honest in the fly.
We'd like a leg off the flight,

187
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:40,800
get the genome from it,
then we want the data.

188
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:44,760
Maybe you can see at the moment what we
do is we tend to one, pick those labels,

189
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:48,360
photograph them and then start
extracting information off that.

190
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:53,010
That's okay for a few tens of thousands,
for a few millions, you need to,

191
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:54,750
you need to break that.
Similarly,

192
00:10:54,751 --> 00:10:58,320
you can see the way that the
different labels or um, uh,

193
00:10:58,590 --> 00:11:02,730
typed out or written there. You can see
that, um, how are you going to do that?

194
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:04,410
You're really going to
transcribe that by hand.

195
00:11:04,411 --> 00:11:09,390
So at the moment we sometimes use a
curator to an expert if you like to

196
00:11:09,391 --> 00:11:12,660
transcribe that.
But typically we want to apply OCR first.

197
00:11:12,661 --> 00:11:15,870
We want to cut that image
up, put it back together. Um,

198
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:18,950
use OCR to figure out what
sort of like a labels. Um,

199
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:23,220
so we've got some image recognition
software to look at what's a return label

200
00:11:23,221 --> 00:11:24,540
and what's a handwritten label.

201
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:27,810
Then we want to use OCR on
the written or typed labels.

202
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:30,780
Then we started to go down
into their handwritten labels.

203
00:11:30,930 --> 00:11:34,440
We crowdsource some of that
really fun crowd sourcing,

204
00:11:34,441 --> 00:11:38,520
but at the moment we can digitize
things about 10 times as fast as we can

205
00:11:38,521 --> 00:11:39,354
crowdsource them.

206
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:44,630
So we need to only be serving things
to real humans that need a real human's

207
00:11:44,641 --> 00:11:45,474
mind.

208
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:49,580
We need to do everything we can without
that human mind before that last result

209
00:11:49,581 --> 00:11:51,420
if you're like,
so that fascinating.

210
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:54,220
I think all of us can
understand the parallels between

211
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:55,870
the sort of tagging taxonomy,

212
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:59,890
a structured sets and the
ingestion of large amounts of data.

213
00:11:59,891 --> 00:12:01,420
And we'll talk a bit
more about some of that.

214
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,230
Maybe let's just end by looking at one
of the ways in which the teams work with

215
00:12:05,231 --> 00:12:08,470
you to try to make this
stuff more accessible. Uh,

216
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:11,570
I think we've got a little
video of the Romaleos. Saurus

217
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,130
can we,
can we go and have a quick look at that?

218
00:12:15,131 --> 00:12:17,920
Cause I think the other part of what
we're trying to do is obviously increased

219
00:12:17,921 --> 00:12:20,440
people's interest in accessibility to
this. So let's have a look at this.

220
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:16,360
Many of you have seen some of this,

221
00:13:16,361 --> 00:13:19,960
but to have a look if you haven't at
the arts and Culture App and these

222
00:13:19,961 --> 00:13:21,970
connections that are
really a sensation on,

223
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:25,540
and it's a sense that we're just
starting the journey of what's possible.

224
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:27,850
I would still ask you events,
uh,

225
00:13:27,851 --> 00:13:32,770
about your personal journey because as
an evolutionary biologist to become the

226
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:37,070
head of the informatics division,
how did that start? Yeah,

227
00:13:37,090 --> 00:13:39,050
that's a bit of a loose
about the journeys. I mean,

228
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:43,180
started perhaps like I guess
like many phd students in, in,

229
00:13:43,181 --> 00:13:46,500
in the UK with an interest in the
natural world. And I wanted to find the,

230
00:13:46,501 --> 00:13:50,730
an interesting project to work on. And
the group that I chose to work on, um,

231
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:54,990
was a rather obscure in group
called parasitic lights.

232
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:58,390
So we're familiar with them as the
parasites that live in our, uh,

233
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:02,040
sometimes live in our school, children's
hair, and a very difficult to get rid of.

234
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:06,900
But they're really fascinating group
because they've coevolve with the hosts

235
00:14:06,901 --> 00:14:10,830
over millions and millions of years.
And when I started to work on them,

236
00:14:10,831 --> 00:14:15,240
there was very little known about them.
So I started a database. I started, um,

237
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:19,800
very crude and rudimentary digital
techniques to try and build that,

238
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:21,360
that put that data together.

239
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:26,550
It was also at a time when the web was
almost just being born is about 2000.

240
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:31,380
So about 1997 to 2000. I did my phd. And,

241
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:31,920
um,

242
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:36,920
the web was just being explored as a
scientific tool and increasingly we needed

243
00:14:37,681 --> 00:14:41,940
to build databases to share that
information, to make it accessible,

244
00:14:41,941 --> 00:14:43,700
to make it curator bubble.
Yeah.

245
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:43,950
All right.

246
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:46,590
So this is actually at the time when the
web was being used in the way that it

247
00:14:46,591 --> 00:14:49,770
was designed by, you know, affected
by Tim in terms of research.

248
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:53,270
Exactly. And, um, I started to,

249
00:14:53,271 --> 00:14:56,150
because there were no easy to
use tools that are out there,

250
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:58,880
I really have to build
those systems myself.

251
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:03,290
So very simple system sharing
information about specimens, images,

252
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:04,640
molecular data,

253
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:08,810
and trying to do that in a way that
would bring in many of my colleagues.

254
00:15:08,811 --> 00:15:12,510
Because, as you can imagine, there aren't
many Laos authorities around the, uh,

255
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:15,500
in the UK.
They tend to be very widely scattered.

256
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:19,310
I needed to communicate with them and
I needed to be able to bring their

257
00:15:19,311 --> 00:15:24,200
expertise to this database. And then
over time, of course I realize that the,

258
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:28,430
the rather parochial little problem
that I had in trying to understand the

259
00:15:28,431 --> 00:15:32,870
evolution of this group was a PA in
parallel really to everybody, other,

260
00:15:32,871 --> 00:15:36,680
all the other authorities working
on other taxonomic groups.

261
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:41,450
And so we started instead of building
systems just to study parasitic lice,

262
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:43,310
we started to build platforms,

263
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:46,340
platforms that would work
for other taxonomic groups.

264
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:49,970
And that was when I started to get
very seriously interested in digital.

265
00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:54,230
And was there a moment where you could
see the potential of this technology?

266
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:56,600
I mean obviously you started because you
were just doing your own cataloging and

267
00:15:56,601 --> 00:15:57,710
then you start to connect with others.

268
00:15:57,711 --> 00:16:01,450
Was there a moment where you
started to go, oh, I can see
how big this? I think, um,

269
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:04,490
probably that moment was when
I started to collaborate on a,

270
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:09,500
a global project called the tree of life
to actually share that information on

271
00:16:09,681 --> 00:16:10,640
what was at the time.

272
00:16:10,641 --> 00:16:14,900
It still exists actually a pretty
rudimentary website where we are trying to

273
00:16:14,901 --> 00:16:19,340
share data about the evolutionary
history of taxonomic groups. And a,

274
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:20,213
an uh,

275
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:24,500
an evolutionary biologist in the u s had
built this platform that was critical

276
00:16:24,501 --> 00:16:29,090
to building those evolutionary crease
and allowed us to share that data.

277
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,880
And then I started to
collaborate on that project.

278
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:36,680
That was probably the epiphany moment
when I started to realize there's really

279
00:16:36,681 --> 00:16:41,480
something in this for many other taxa
in terms of how we do this at a global

280
00:16:41,481 --> 00:16:43,190
level.
But it all started with light.

281
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:48,280
It all started with this very curious
group of about 5,000 species of parasites

282
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:51,170
on about 5,000 species of mammal,

283
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:56,200
about 10,000 species of bird and about
12,000 associations between those and as,

284
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:00,200
as a student basically trying
to manage all of that data,

285
00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:04,550
trying to extract that from the scientific
literature, that's an enormous task.

286
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:08,840
You break it up into small enough chunks
and you distribute the problem and

287
00:17:08,841 --> 00:17:11,260
actually it becomes a tractable problem.
Fantastic.

288
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:14,210
And they'll tell us a bit more about
where you are today and the focus that you

289
00:17:14,211 --> 00:17:18,760
have today with a digital portal,
with all the specimens that you're in,

290
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:22,130
the process of digitizing.
So I think there's two big challenges now.

291
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:26,240
So I lead the informatics group within
the museum and I think we have two big

292
00:17:26,241 --> 00:17:30,260
challenges, one of which and alluded to
and it's beautifully illustrated there,

293
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,600
just the sheer scale of the collection,

294
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:37,130
the enormity of this physical
collection and trying to digitize that,

295
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:40,300
that insect that you see,
that pinned insect,

296
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:45,290
that fly there is a good
example of digitizing that
through traditional methods.

297
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:49,100
Takes about two minutes and 20 seconds
to take all of those labels off,

298
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:52,140
to take a photograph to get
a rudimentary transcription.

299
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:57,000
And what we really want to do is
speed that process up. So robotics,

300
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:00,390
I can potentially help using, um, uh,

301
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:05,420
tools are able to allow us to digitally
reconstruct the label without physically

302
00:18:05,791 --> 00:18:10,290
having to take them off. Unfortunately,
some of those labels are folded. So alas,

303
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,070
we can't,

304
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:13,950
yeah,
anybody here work on the books project?

305
00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:18,000
So the early days of our book scanning
project was basically Larry and Sergei

306
00:18:18,001 --> 00:18:22,030
arguing about how quickly
you could digitize a book
and and using a photocopier

307
00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:24,750
to sort of figure out the mechanics of
doing it was very much the same kind of

308
00:18:24,751 --> 00:18:25,360
problem here.

309
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,880
It's very, it's a very
rudimentary problem in some ways,

310
00:18:27,881 --> 00:18:30,250
but I think things like
computer vision for example,

311
00:18:30,251 --> 00:18:33,790
a critical to then helping stitch
some of those images together.

312
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:38,320
So we can use a rig where we can take
a number of oblique images of that

313
00:18:38,321 --> 00:18:42,520
specimen, automatically
stitch it together, run OCR,

314
00:18:42,521 --> 00:18:46,750
run handwriting recognition across that
and that Paul of material that then

315
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:51,960
fails those tests we then put through to
our crowd sourcing so that then humans

316
00:18:52,211 --> 00:18:53,960
can start intervening
and getting that data.

317
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:59,330
The first key challenge is the large
scale digitization of those artifacts in

318
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,160
and species specimens and so on.

319
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:02,420
Yeah.
And what else did it,

320
00:19:02,421 --> 00:19:05,600
so the next big challenge I think
is how do we exploit that data?

321
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:10,220
How do we meaningfully get data
from particularly that imagery?

322
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:14,810
So there is a, um, a huge opportunity
I think in terms of computer vision,

323
00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:19,970
in terms of trying to recognize in an
automated way what those objects are and

324
00:19:19,971 --> 00:19:24,050
then apply that across all sorts of
science across, across the globe.

325
00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:29,350
So of course we have the authoritative
collection of all of the,

326
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:30,650
uh,

327
00:19:30,650 --> 00:19:34,850
roughly 2 million species that have been
described so far and we can potentially

328
00:19:34,851 --> 00:19:37,460
get imagery for sometimes 10,

329
00:19:37,461 --> 00:19:40,340
sometimes hundreds of
thousands of those specimens.

330
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:45,470
So being able then to use that imagery
to facilitate things like automatic

331
00:19:45,471 --> 00:19:48,860
species recognition so that
imagine someone, um, uh,

332
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:52,610
a member of the public perhaps
innocently taking a photograph out on the

333
00:19:52,611 --> 00:19:56,960
Serengeti or we're basically wherever
they are and being able to automatically

334
00:19:56,961 --> 00:20:00,380
recognize what's in that
image and exploit that.

335
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:05,560
That has a huge transformative potential
in terms of helping us to understand

336
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:08,390
the natural world.
What's there when it was

337
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:11,340
pick some of us were thinking
about when you were showing, uh,

338
00:20:11,370 --> 00:20:13,550
when we're showing the
Lepidoptera and thinking, well,

339
00:20:13,551 --> 00:20:16,940
how far away are we from just being
able to use a camera to identify how far

340
00:20:16,941 --> 00:20:19,460
away are we?
Does it vary by species or,

341
00:20:19,570 --> 00:20:22,560
so it really varies by tag to
something. There's some tax, uh,

342
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:25,130
some groups lend
themselves to that. So, uh,

343
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:28,870
butterflies and moths in particular
Lepidoptera because they're quite two

344
00:20:28,871 --> 00:20:33,700
dimensional and many of the key
characteristics you can see in, um, uh,

345
00:20:33,790 --> 00:20:36,970
in that image you can actually
get species recognition.

346
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:41,620
Certainly recognition to some of the
lower taxes for other groups, it's much,

347
00:20:41,621 --> 00:20:44,500
much harder. There's much more
three dimensionality to them.

348
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:47,000
The discriminating features a tucked away,

349
00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:51,550
a hidden away getting it that information
is harder, but that's the potential.

350
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:54,430
Right. And, and if we step from
what you're doing to Ian's role,

351
00:20:54,431 --> 00:20:56,320
which is as director of science,

352
00:20:56,321 --> 00:21:00,030
what are the things that most excite you
and that the big challenges that you're

353
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:00,873
focusing on

354
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:05,280
in this area? There's also the public
aspects of this. So we all, you know,

355
00:21:05,281 --> 00:21:09,240
when you look at that museum to begin with
this, we are a scientific institution,

356
00:21:09,241 --> 00:21:12,390
but we also want to get the broad public
interested in these sorts of things.

357
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:15,960
And there's a selfish reason for that
because if we think that if you want to

358
00:21:15,961 --> 00:21:17,160
make politicians and so on,

359
00:21:17,161 --> 00:21:20,490
bold enough to make good decisions
for the long term environment,

360
00:21:20,491 --> 00:21:22,080
you need to get the
public interested in that.

361
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:25,380
And lots of events show there's
a long way to go with that.

362
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:28,620
So things like the Rumelia short source,
we were just looking at there,

363
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:33,120
that's an amazing way of literally
bringing an iconic specimen to life.

364
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:36,390
So that specimen is in the,
is one of our main halls.

365
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:40,500
It was collected right at the beginning
of this discovery period by a woman

366
00:21:40,501 --> 00:21:42,870
called Mary Anning.
So great story behind it.

367
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:46,230
But by using that bit of
Vr to bring it to to life,

368
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:49,590
to give that to schools and well it
lets you tell some really interesting

369
00:21:49,591 --> 00:21:51,360
stories and if you watched the video,

370
00:21:51,570 --> 00:21:56,130
I showed him how to goodness knows how
many people have all sorts of ages that

371
00:21:56,670 --> 00:21:58,800
totally captivated to begin with.

372
00:21:58,801 --> 00:22:01,740
They liked the buzz of what they put
on the cardboard. They like that.

373
00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:03,990
Then they see the Vr,
they like that.

374
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,870
That's still sufficiently need
to intro to interest them.

375
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:10,240
The creature comes towards them,
almost everybody kind of Ah,

376
00:22:10,290 --> 00:22:12,570
you no bit scared by it.
But then afterwards,

377
00:22:12,571 --> 00:22:16,710
as a narrative about the natural world
and about the oceans, that's afterwards,

378
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:18,930
that's what they want to ask you about.
So it's really,

379
00:22:18,931 --> 00:22:21,570
really interesting and he couldn't
do a better thing with a specimen.

380
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:25,200
Then that series of events and the
cool thing about that, of course it's,

381
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:29,250
well we do that all the time with people
that are lucky enough to be standing,

382
00:22:29,251 --> 00:22:33,240
talking to us in South Kensington.
But if you want to change society's,

383
00:22:33,241 --> 00:22:36,060
mine's about things. It has to,
it has to be more than that.

384
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:37,480
And that's what that really does mean.

385
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:38,673
So you,

386
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:42,650
you are organizing the natural world's
information and making it accessible and

387
00:22:42,651 --> 00:22:46,210
useful to everyone, which actually
ring true to us as well. Yeah. Um,

388
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:50,840
and do you worry about I need to get
people to the museum versus if I digitize

389
00:22:50,841 --> 00:22:55,840
things they won't come or what's your
experience been of that affects the

390
00:22:55,850 --> 00:22:56,683
opposite.

391
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:59,990
So the moment that you start to digitize
things and we see this for example,

392
00:22:59,991 --> 00:23:03,040
with our loan, so we are in one
sense, we are a rather curious museum.

393
00:23:03,050 --> 00:23:07,070
Many museums are about preserving and
holding on to things were busy sending

394
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:11,120
tens of thousands of specimens
out on academic loans every year.

395
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:15,080
And actually the experience is when you
digitize those and you make digitalized

396
00:23:15,081 --> 00:23:19,160
copies of those available,
you actually get more loan requests,

397
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:23,270
more engagement, not less. So I
think quite the opposite actually.

398
00:23:23,271 --> 00:23:27,770
I think digital brings many
more people physically in to uh,

399
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:31,880
engage with our collections.
One of the interesting things in music,

400
00:23:31,881 --> 00:23:35,960
we see that an explosion in people going
to see music live as well as having

401
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:38,550
every recorded song in history
and they're in their pocket.

402
00:23:38,551 --> 00:23:40,280
So it seems that one drives the other.

403
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:44,000
And what are the other challenges
that you face in terms of the public

404
00:23:44,001 --> 00:23:47,840
engagement? I guess I don't to mention
any of the political events of this week,

405
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,160
but, uh, you know,

406
00:23:49,161 --> 00:23:51,770
we're in a world where things may go
backwards rather than forwards in some of

407
00:23:51,771 --> 00:23:52,790
these agendas.
What's the,

408
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:56,510
what's the best way for you to connect
with the policy makers and get ongoing

409
00:23:56,511 --> 00:23:57,950
support?
Cause this stuff costs,

410
00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:01,340
it was started by the amateurs and
that's why the by the filthy rich, but,

411
00:24:01,341 --> 00:24:02,750
but now this is a real cost to it.

412
00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:05,930
And how do you deal with the policy making
challenge in the funding challenge it.

413
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:10,440
So that's, um, that's a good
question about, um, the, um,

414
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:13,530
the challenge with respect to the
public and the policy makers is,

415
00:24:13,531 --> 00:24:17,070
as I said when I started, this is not
to feel as though you're lecturing them.

416
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:21,060
If they come into the museum or they
come onto our different sorts of products

417
00:24:21,061 --> 00:24:24,900
and they feel that they know this is going
to be a lecture about giving more aid

418
00:24:24,901 --> 00:24:29,160
with respect to diseases or climate
change or habitat, um, usage and saw,

419
00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:30,450
they veer away from that.

420
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:34,410
So as with lots of different
media advertising for example,

421
00:24:34,411 --> 00:24:36,660
you've got to get a smart
way into their head,

422
00:24:36,690 --> 00:24:40,110
get the hook into their head and
then start to talk and almost they're

423
00:24:40,111 --> 00:24:42,090
interested.
Talk to them about the bigger piece.

424
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:45,810
So you can see that the sorts of objects
we were just talking about that they're

425
00:24:45,811 --> 00:24:50,190
fascinating. Um, they've got some
interesting scientific points about them,

426
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:54,420
but there are way into people's heads
and that's the way we often use it in

427
00:24:54,421 --> 00:24:55,710
terms of funding and so on.

428
00:24:55,710 --> 00:25:00,710
What we see and the way of funding these
sorts of missions is a combination of

429
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:05,250
government support and then
getting different sorts of
entrepreneurial support.

430
00:25:05,610 --> 00:25:07,140
So if you look around the world,

431
00:25:07,141 --> 00:25:10,530
that institutions that have done
most digitalization typically so far,

432
00:25:10,770 --> 00:25:14,670
they've usually been doing that based
on substantial government support.

433
00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:18,750
I'd say the limitation of that is
that doesn't necessarily make you very

434
00:25:18,751 --> 00:25:23,550
innovative. You get 10 million bucks
to do your botanical collection.

435
00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:26,080
So you do that and then you stop doing it.

436
00:25:26,090 --> 00:25:30,660
What we want to create is
a set of platforms that
anybody can do it anywhere and

437
00:25:30,661 --> 00:25:32,820
it's much cheaper and so on to do that.

438
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:37,170
So I see that sweet spot as the
government support plus different sorts of

439
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,000
entrepreneurial ventures as well.

440
00:25:40,610 --> 00:25:42,660
Yeah, I was just going to
him and I think one, the,

441
00:25:42,661 --> 00:25:45,710
the one cap on top of that also
isn't really great science,

442
00:25:45,711 --> 00:25:48,530
which demonstrates why
this data is so important.

443
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,700
And that slide that we
had just earlier the,

444
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:54,770
the work actually that drew was involved
in demonstrating that we have lost

445
00:25:54,771 --> 00:25:59,600
significant fractions of biodiversity
and that if we continue along that path,

446
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:04,240
we will lose a, at an increasing rate.
That biodiversity is a great illustration.

447
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:07,210
Was going to ask you a bit more about that
exactly at this point actually. So, uh,

448
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:09,380
tell us more about how
you're using the data.

449
00:26:09,381 --> 00:26:14,381
You have the historic data to extrapolate
the future trends and to highlight

450
00:26:14,511 --> 00:26:17,090
these issues. What are the challenges
there? What's it showing it?

451
00:26:17,210 --> 00:26:19,190
So that project used,
um,

452
00:26:19,330 --> 00:26:23,630
a mixture of basically data
mining but very human intensive,

453
00:26:23,631 --> 00:26:25,400
rather laborious,
actually data mining.

454
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:30,400
So an army has students rated lots of
scientific literature that was basically

455
00:26:30,471 --> 00:26:35,471
showing changing patterns
of the biodiversity before
and after land use change.

456
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:40,220
And by knowing what was there and by
knowing what was there now and being able

457
00:26:40,221 --> 00:26:42,290
to classify those different habitats,

458
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:46,830
we can start to then see where there's
been the most biodiversity loss.

459
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:52,100
And we can also start to
model how a future things
like climate change scenarios

460
00:26:52,501 --> 00:26:55,140
for example,
are going to impact that loss.

461
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:57,870
Because the good news and there
is some good news from this,

462
00:26:58,020 --> 00:27:03,020
is that some of those climate change
scenarios can mitigate that rate of loss

463
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:07,020
and we can actually start to repair some
of the damage that we've been doing.

464
00:27:07,630 --> 00:27:11,820
So tell us a bit more about what's shown
here and about the work that you're

465
00:27:11,821 --> 00:27:13,870
doing it with a machine learning expert.

466
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:19,490
Do you want to talk about it all in
on it? So this is a, um, this is, uh,

467
00:27:19,930 --> 00:27:22,870
this is just the trust real
world at the moment. Uh,

468
00:27:22,871 --> 00:27:26,240
but this is showing the
percentage of original um,

469
00:27:26,350 --> 00:27:31,240
flora and fauna that are
still there. So, um, if you,

470
00:27:31,270 --> 00:27:34,450
um, I think that's the way around if it
is yes. So if you've got a blue number,

471
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:38,480
that means that a large proportion
of bloop color that's um,

472
00:27:38,810 --> 00:27:42,660
a large proportion of the species are
still intact. Um, as it gets redder,

473
00:27:42,690 --> 00:27:45,880
it means that an increasingly large
proportion of being lost and there's all

474
00:27:45,881 --> 00:27:47,740
sorts of different ways you
can add those numbers up.

475
00:27:47,770 --> 00:27:49,840
Obviously the main conclusions to this,

476
00:27:49,910 --> 00:27:54,070
a pretty robust to those sorts
of differences in exactly
which species you glue.

477
00:27:54,310 --> 00:27:59,310
Now what you can see is the global average
is that we've lost about 13% or so of

478
00:27:59,561 --> 00:28:00,394
species.

479
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:03,970
What you can also see is that it's
incredibly heterogeneously distributed.

480
00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:05,140
There are some areas,

481
00:28:05,141 --> 00:28:08,290
often whether it's relatively low
species that are relatively intact,

482
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:11,890
there are also places such as the Amazon
basin there that you can see that are

483
00:28:11,891 --> 00:28:15,850
intact. You can see there are some other
areas that are an incredibly disturbed.

484
00:28:16,210 --> 00:28:19,280
Now at the moment, one of the
interesting things, stroke,

485
00:28:19,281 --> 00:28:23,650
terrifying things is we don't actually
know what the function looks like between

486
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:28,030
this type of species count
and ecological functioning.

487
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:31,830
Now these guys have also been doing
some work on another index called, um,

488
00:28:31,970 --> 00:28:36,820
whether trying to actually estimate the
effects of this on ecosystems that's an

489
00:28:36,821 --> 00:28:40,120
unexplored, well, it's very exciting,
but a relatively unexplored area.

490
00:28:40,121 --> 00:28:43,600
So we don't know whether there are people
called tipping points in this system

491
00:28:43,601 --> 00:28:45,550
or whatever.
There are linear relationships and so on.

492
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:49,390
One of the other cool things about
natural history collections is they are

493
00:28:49,391 --> 00:28:53,140
literally a time machine.
So they're one of the,

494
00:28:53,141 --> 00:28:57,700
one of very few on and ambiguous ways
that you can go back a few hundred years.

495
00:28:57,730 --> 00:28:58,180
And Matt,

496
00:28:58,180 --> 00:29:01,660
what's been happening and those few
hundred years that we've been around

497
00:29:01,661 --> 00:29:04,450
collecting things or our ancestors
had been around collecting things,

498
00:29:04,451 --> 00:29:08,980
of course was exactly the moment when
Western civilization started going around

499
00:29:08,981 --> 00:29:12,130
the world and driving a lot of this.
So it's a,

500
00:29:12,370 --> 00:29:13,900
I suppose it's a fortunate accident.

501
00:29:13,901 --> 00:29:17,830
At the same time we started exploiting
the world and doing this to it.

502
00:29:18,130 --> 00:29:23,130
We were collecting through that period.
So it's a time machine. The, the, um,

503
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:26,950
the challenge now is to open that up now
we've done some of that analytically so

504
00:29:26,951 --> 00:29:31,951
we can push some of these graphs back
to about 1500 using some generalizations

505
00:29:32,741 --> 00:29:36,550
about the way the world works with
respect to the sort of habitats that are

506
00:29:36,551 --> 00:29:37,270
there.

507
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:40,840
But these collections offered
the opportunity to be much
more specific than that

508
00:29:40,841 --> 00:29:41,674
as well.

509
00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:43,071
Well, um, can,

510
00:29:43,071 --> 00:29:47,030
can you say a little bit about how you've
collaborated with the deep mind team

511
00:29:47,031 --> 00:29:51,350
or with, with the Google
teams. What's that been like?
How easy was it to just, Oh,

512
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:55,580
it was obvious we need to do this and how
much was it trying to figure out a way

513
00:29:55,581 --> 00:29:56,414
of working?

514
00:29:56,790 --> 00:30:01,230
So come on, be honest. We ask now. Well,
it's, it's, there are good things to say,

515
00:30:01,231 --> 00:30:05,130
so it's easy to be honest. When we first
started talking to each other, um, yes,

516
00:30:05,131 --> 00:30:07,760
there's that classic cultural
difference about, you know,

517
00:30:08,250 --> 00:30:10,800
what's important and so on.
I found that,

518
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:15,000
well I found that a mixture of incredibly
rewarding and very, very challenging.

519
00:30:15,001 --> 00:30:18,580
So sometimes I'll talk to
a couple of your guys, um,

520
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:20,790
and they will start to ask me,
so why do you,

521
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:24,180
why do you bring botanical
specimens back to the museum?

522
00:30:24,450 --> 00:30:28,110
So doing it for 200 years, young
man, that's the way we do it.

523
00:30:28,650 --> 00:30:31,860
But once you go through the whole
flow of why you're doing it,

524
00:30:31,861 --> 00:30:35,100
the information that you can see,
we could capture all of that in the field.

525
00:30:35,101 --> 00:30:38,610
Now you realize the only
reason to actually bring the
specimen back is just as a

526
00:30:38,611 --> 00:30:40,410
voucher for all of that information.

527
00:30:40,410 --> 00:30:43,950
So sometimes it completely changes
how you think. And to be honest,

528
00:30:44,370 --> 00:30:46,110
for an institution that's 200 years old,

529
00:30:46,111 --> 00:30:47,730
that's one of the big things
you've got to be doing.

530
00:30:47,731 --> 00:30:49,920
You've got to be challenging
yourself on very fun. You know,

531
00:30:49,921 --> 00:30:52,320
why collect and if you're
going to collect tomorrow,

532
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:55,620
why the hell are you going to collect
the same way as he did 200 years ago?

533
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:57,840
You should throw that out
and completely rethink it.

534
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:01,440
The second layer for you is,
yeah,

535
00:31:01,441 --> 00:31:04,770
you guys work quickly in a very,
very nimble way.

536
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:08,820
So we like to plan projects going on,
plenty of paperwork there,

537
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:11,820
maybe plan it again and that
sort of thing. And you know,

538
00:31:11,821 --> 00:31:14,940
we'll do that over a couple of years.
Um, where you guys are kind of say,

539
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:18,770
so I remember when we were doing the
Romaleos saurus there, let's do it.

540
00:31:18,771 --> 00:31:21,950
Let's do a Vr of this. Oh, okay.
That's that kind of us, you know,

541
00:31:22,050 --> 00:31:25,080
that's a good idea. This is
what it would involve. Caitlin.

542
00:31:25,170 --> 00:31:28,800
And we were thinking six months a year,
let's do it by the end of the week.

543
00:31:29,070 --> 00:31:33,140
Now for us, that's an
unbelievably challenging
timescale, but it's been a good,

544
00:31:33,141 --> 00:31:34,650
isn't it? Yeah, absolutely. I mean,

545
00:31:34,651 --> 00:31:37,520
I think that agility was what I was
going to pick up on. I think, again,

546
00:31:37,550 --> 00:31:39,960
really in science,
particularly digital science,

547
00:31:39,961 --> 00:31:42,180
we used to having to work quite quickly.

548
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:44,730
So in one sense that
wasn't such a problem.

549
00:31:44,731 --> 00:31:48,210
But working with some of the other bits
of the museum which are may be not quite

550
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:51,360
so comfortable with that. Um, uh, that,

551
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:55,380
that degree of speed of working.
I remember with the tank room,

552
00:31:55,530 --> 00:32:00,240
it was quite literally the decision was
made the night before to do the filming.

553
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:04,710
So being able to turn the museum around
to secure the permissions necessary to

554
00:32:04,711 --> 00:32:07,800
do that filming and literally to
be in there the following morning,

555
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:11,280
that is quite a challenge.
We showed it to her,

556
00:32:11,281 --> 00:32:15,570
this amazing room that you go into, which
has got historical samples all around.

557
00:32:15,571 --> 00:32:19,590
Absolutely wonderful. The wonderful
curator that knows every specimen.

558
00:32:19,591 --> 00:32:23,250
There's the original sealer camp and
things in there. We show this to say,

559
00:32:23,251 --> 00:32:25,620
I think I was about five
o'clock by the time we got all,

560
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:27,900
he was telling us stories and we said,

561
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:31,380
why don't we put this on the
cultural institutes? So what he says,

562
00:32:31,381 --> 00:32:35,020
if you've got an objection, no objection,
but how are we going to do that?

563
00:32:35,021 --> 00:32:39,090
Because if I can get the right team here,
I guess eight o'clock the next morning,

564
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:40,040
can we film

565
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:42,620
this and do the videos and
do the three d modeling.

566
00:32:42,770 --> 00:32:45,530
So if you can get your team here by
eight o'clock we'll be here. Yeah.

567
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:49,430
And we did it the next morning and now
we've been trying to do that center since

568
00:32:49,431 --> 00:32:50,810
I've been at the museum.

569
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:53,300
So to be able to accelerate
things at that pace of the half,

570
00:32:53,301 --> 00:32:58,280
that attitude and those resources to be
able to really have that team the next

571
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:00,590
morning knocking on the door. And
they were incredible. And I was,

572
00:33:00,591 --> 00:33:03,230
I was actually just watching that.
It's a three 60 video. And is it,

573
00:33:03,231 --> 00:33:04,210
is it only the,
the,

574
00:33:04,910 --> 00:33:09,200
the curator of all things fish and
it's brilliant because it's extremely

575
00:33:09,201 --> 00:33:13,100
accessible. He's a natural. He's, he
should be on television and now he,

576
00:33:13,190 --> 00:33:17,230
and now he is. So that's part
of making it accessible and uh,

577
00:33:17,270 --> 00:33:20,360
any difficulties, I mean there's
obviously there's a pace thing,

578
00:33:20,361 --> 00:33:21,470
there's a bit of an agility thing.

579
00:33:21,470 --> 00:33:24,820
You mentioned any difficulties where
we were just at cross purposes or,

580
00:33:24,821 --> 00:33:26,660
or the agenda that our teams had was,

581
00:33:26,930 --> 00:33:29,570
was just at odds with what was
going to drive your work forward?

582
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:34,130
I don't think they are, I don't think
there are major differences like that.

583
00:33:34,131 --> 00:33:37,550
I think it, that challenge
eventually is prioritization.

584
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,710
So whenever we're in a room together,

585
00:33:39,711 --> 00:33:44,620
we can come up with 20 cool ideas and
then it's the case that was 20 it was a

586
00:33:44,630 --> 00:33:47,630
short meeting and then it's
a case of figuring out, okay,

587
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:51,650
which ones are we going to work on?
Work on next. Really. So that's what,

588
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:53,240
this is an exciting challenge.

589
00:33:53,241 --> 00:33:57,020
So I want to come to the audience and
that get any questions or suggestions or

590
00:33:57,021 --> 00:33:57,561
thoughts you have.

591
00:33:57,561 --> 00:34:01,640
So just raise your hand and it has a
mic if you want to do any of that while

592
00:34:01,641 --> 00:34:04,840
you're having a think about
really smart questions. Uh,

593
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:08,310
just kind of coming back to you and
the work that you're doing, what,

594
00:34:08,370 --> 00:34:11,150
what do you see as being the
biggest areas of potential next?

595
00:34:11,151 --> 00:34:13,160
You've talked a bit about the
kind of near term challenges,

596
00:34:13,161 --> 00:34:15,640
but where do you think this could
go? So I mean I think, I think

597
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:20,700
ultimately the really grand challenge
is not what we've talked about here is

598
00:34:21,180 --> 00:34:23,440
obviously relevant to the
natural history museum,

599
00:34:23,441 --> 00:34:26,380
but there are literally hundreds,

600
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:29,500
thousands of natural history museums all
around the globe that have entirely the

601
00:34:29,501 --> 00:34:30,334
same problem.

602
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:35,580
Ian Talk Right at the beginning about
that figure of roughly 1.5 to 3 billion

603
00:34:35,591 --> 00:34:38,350
specimens in natural history collections.

604
00:34:38,470 --> 00:34:43,000
So how do we take our problem that we
have at the natural history museum and

605
00:34:43,270 --> 00:34:47,020
build solutions that work for all of
those institutions to try and extract that

606
00:34:47,021 --> 00:34:51,190
data? Because for me, the really
grand vision, if you like,

607
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:55,210
as to what we're going to do with all
of that data is to try to model the

608
00:34:55,211 --> 00:34:56,050
natural world.

609
00:34:56,230 --> 00:35:01,120
So by that I mean take literally every
facet of information that we've possibly

610
00:35:01,121 --> 00:35:05,110
got. Everything about the
taxonomy, the evolutionary history,

611
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:09,430
the traits of the phenotypic traits,
the morphological traits of the specimen,

612
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:13,270
the genotypic information,
all of the a biotic information as well,

613
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:14,740
and start to model that.

614
00:35:14,830 --> 00:35:19,570
So that we have a very
precise understanding of
what the natural world is,

615
00:35:19,690 --> 00:35:23,440
what's happening to it and how can we
mitigate the rest about that to the

616
00:35:23,441 --> 00:35:24,274
natural world.

617
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:29,340
That is probably the ultimate and most
inclusive grand challenge because it

618
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:34,360
basically encompasses or the scientists
involved in the study of the natural

619
00:35:34,361 --> 00:35:37,240
world, all the institutions,
all the collections,

620
00:35:37,410 --> 00:35:42,120
and also the tremendous body of literature
that we've already generated on this.

621
00:35:42,330 --> 00:35:43,800
In a curious way,

622
00:35:43,950 --> 00:35:48,410
our science is a little bit unusual to a
number of other science sciences in the

623
00:35:48,411 --> 00:35:52,020
loss of the documentation
about the natural world,

624
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:56,220
even if it was written 300 years
ago is still highly relevant today.

625
00:35:56,221 --> 00:35:58,500
And then you can't say that
about physics or astronomy,

626
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:01,230
but you can say that about our science.

627
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:06,210
So we have 300 million pages of text,
pretty much that have been,

628
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:10,290
that represent the corpus of knowledge
that had been written so far about the

629
00:36:10,291 --> 00:36:12,930
natural world.
We have a big program to digitize that.

630
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:16,110
We've done about 50 million
of those pages so far. Um,

631
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:18,180
but trying to then extract meaning,

632
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:23,010
semantic meaning from that
is also a huge opportunity.

633
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:27,870
But that grand vision is to really bring
it all together in an integrative way

634
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:33,020
so that we have effectively at all for
the whole of the scientific communities.

635
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:34,260
That's striking when you talk,

636
00:36:34,261 --> 00:36:37,590
I mean I think we see this in many areas
that were in different disciplines come

637
00:36:37,591 --> 00:36:40,440
together. That's when creativity
in innovation really happens.

638
00:36:40,470 --> 00:36:45,360
You talk in a way that I'm
not see biologists talk
about platforms and data and

639
00:36:45,361 --> 00:36:49,770
applying that to problems or others in
your field starting to do the same thing.

640
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:54,450
Or are you a as the British navy world?
I think? Well I think the beginning too,

641
00:36:54,451 --> 00:36:57,600
but the challenge also is
partly there one of resources.

642
00:36:57,750 --> 00:37:02,670
So it's relatively easy for someone to
innovate digitally and to do something in

643
00:37:02,671 --> 00:37:06,090
a very sort of project oriented way.
It usually takes,

644
00:37:06,510 --> 00:37:08,100
depending upon the nature of that,

645
00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:12,240
the initiative may be five or 10 times
the amount of revolt resource to actually

646
00:37:12,241 --> 00:37:16,830
build a robust platform that will
then work and scale in a sensible way.

647
00:37:17,010 --> 00:37:18,690
So I think in terms of leadership,

648
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:21,350
yes we probably are leading
the way in some of those, um,

649
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:23,550
development of some of those platforms.

650
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:28,740
But I think it's partly also we're
often trying to serve many different

651
00:37:28,741 --> 00:37:31,650
audiences.
We have to build projects.

652
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:35,530
Often it's more project
oriented than program or um,

653
00:37:35,730 --> 00:37:40,290
platform oriented and trying to bridge
that gap between if you like the project

654
00:37:40,291 --> 00:37:42,150
and the program.
That's the hard bit,

655
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:45,330
that scaling bit something that
Google of course have done so well.

656
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:49,020
I'm just thinking of if be talking to
another when my colleagues questions,

657
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:52,260
thoughts, suggestions
for the guests. Yeah.

658
00:37:53,350 --> 00:37:57,190
Yeah. So you were talking about
the loss of biodiversity. Um,

659
00:37:57,260 --> 00:37:59,540
I assume there are people who say,

660
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:04,310
why should I care that there are only 84
flies where they used to be 100 flies.

661
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:06,740
Um,
so what did you reply to those people?

662
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,980
That's very hard one to answer
actually. I remember, uh,

663
00:38:12,530 --> 00:38:17,000
I remember that same query being made on
a radio four program to a very eminent

664
00:38:17,001 --> 00:38:20,840
scientist actually a few years ago.
And he actually,

665
00:38:21,050 --> 00:38:24,770
well he was rather colorful
in his language in terms
of how he replied because

666
00:38:24,771 --> 00:38:27,440
the truthful answer is
we often don't know.

667
00:38:27,710 --> 00:38:32,150
You could imagine each of these species
as being like a book full of pages that

668
00:38:32,151 --> 00:38:36,820
we've yet to read. Now we don't
know what the value is necessarily

669
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:39,550
in preserving or keeping
all of those species.

670
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:43,300
We can talk in a cultural and a
social sense about general, um,

671
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:44,980
value of biodiversity.

672
00:38:45,130 --> 00:38:49,390
But the specifics of that particular
fly is very hard to pin down.

673
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:53,380
All I can say is if you imagine each
of those species was like a library,

674
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:56,410
you would not burn the library
just because you hadn't read it.

675
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:59,560
You'd probably at least read it first.
That's one ounce.

676
00:38:59,561 --> 00:39:03,150
I don't know whether you've got a
better one. No, that's um, well the,

677
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:06,440
the other answer we use is
we often go into, uh, if,

678
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:09,880
if it's somebody who wants an answer from
a very human perspective than what we

679
00:39:09,881 --> 00:39:12,430
often use is the concept
of ecosystem services.

680
00:39:12,790 --> 00:39:15,880
So we know that at some stage
if you carry on doing this,

681
00:39:16,330 --> 00:39:20,440
eventually you are going to screw up
to an enormous degree because almost

682
00:39:20,441 --> 00:39:23,380
everything, if you ask, you know what you
ate this morning, what you're dressed in,

683
00:39:24,610 --> 00:39:27,340
everybody here, I would imagine this,
you haven't had anything to eat yet.

684
00:39:27,370 --> 00:39:29,540
Well I've had some plants to eat this um,

685
00:39:29,740 --> 00:39:33,220
this morning beat through bread or through
cereals or temperament that might be

686
00:39:33,490 --> 00:39:36,430
you'll be dressed in things
that come from plants and so on.

687
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:40,810
Now at the moment those systems, um, we
can, we can still harvest those systems.

688
00:39:40,811 --> 00:39:44,590
The water that you get will have come
through some sort of natural system is

689
00:39:44,591 --> 00:39:46,900
what almost all the resources
that you ultimately rely on,

690
00:39:47,230 --> 00:39:49,480
including the resources that
are in technical devices.

691
00:39:49,481 --> 00:39:53,590
And so they're coming from natural
systems and now at the moment we are,

692
00:39:54,130 --> 00:39:56,330
we are just staring that bucket.
If you're,

693
00:39:56,350 --> 00:40:01,060
I could a fairly vigorous rate and so
far we can see things going wrong but we

694
00:40:01,061 --> 00:40:05,830
can still harvest it. We don't yet
know how long we can keep doing that.

695
00:40:05,831 --> 00:40:10,831
We can use this map of
course to demonstrate between
different sites sites was

696
00:40:11,110 --> 00:40:11,320
good.

697
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:16,320
Intactness and science with
pouring tactless with respect
to species demonstrate

698
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:19,330
ecosystem services really
start to deteriorate.

699
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:23,020
And so that's the kind of more
strategic and sort of feel like that if

700
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:27,220
everything that we depend on is ultimately
a natural system on this planet,

701
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:32,110
um, and we need to, we need to
keep that intact for humanity.

702
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:35,400
And there are thumb systems that are
exceedingly vulnerable at the moment.

703
00:40:35,410 --> 00:40:37,630
The coral reefs would be
a great example of that.

704
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:40,680
We're about to hit a tipping point due to,
um,

705
00:40:40,930 --> 00:40:43,720
a rising sea temperature
in ocean acidification,

706
00:40:43,810 --> 00:40:46,240
which probably means that by about 20,
50,

707
00:40:46,510 --> 00:40:50,650
virtually every single coral reef will
have very significant damage and some

708
00:40:50,651 --> 00:40:54,970
will just simply be wiped out because
their tolerance to that environmental

709
00:40:54,971 --> 00:40:57,850
change is just simply too narrow.
They can't cope.

710
00:40:58,210 --> 00:41:03,210
So many of those or all the services
that are dependent from tourism,

711
00:41:03,581 --> 00:41:08,140
from fishing, from the ornamental
fish trade, uh, through, uh,

712
00:41:08,170 --> 00:41:11,270
to, um, uh, yeah, there's a,

713
00:41:11,271 --> 00:41:16,271
a world of economic loss that will also
happen when we lose those coral reefs.

714
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:21,130
I guess this kind of modeling will
allow us to understand things like if we

715
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:24,040
don't honor the Paris climate
agreement for example,

716
00:41:24,070 --> 00:41:27,160
what kind of implications there could be.
You extrapolate exactly.

717
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:30,820
One of the really interesting when you
asked before matter about effectively how

718
00:41:30,821 --> 00:41:33,260
to influence policy makers.
I don't know why it's on my mind.

719
00:41:33,261 --> 00:41:37,770
I'm sorry I'm putting aside some um,

720
00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:41,360
challenging examples.
Another error.

721
00:41:41,361 --> 00:41:44,490
I think that we need to get smarter in
this as well as getting a kind of the

722
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:46,160
suitable hook into their mind.

723
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:51,460
We also need to give them solutions as
well as problems and some of the work

724
00:41:51,591 --> 00:41:54,650
that comes out of this project has really
interesting in that respect and that

725
00:41:54,710 --> 00:41:56,390
you've probably all familiar with the,

726
00:41:56,600 --> 00:42:00,290
with the hawks called the hockey
stick curves for climate change.

727
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:05,060
So it goes them from relatively cool in
the path and it goes up at an alarming

728
00:42:05,061 --> 00:42:08,240
rate with why it's called the hockey stick
curve and at the right hand side that

729
00:42:08,270 --> 00:42:11,930
it's got different scenarios. It's usually
got four to six different scenarios.

730
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:16,210
As a biologist, I look at that with
real MB because that little guy,

731
00:42:16,211 --> 00:42:18,320
you're really modeling
the physical world there.

732
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:20,960
You know you've got a bit of climate
that you got a bit of historical climate

733
00:42:20,961 --> 00:42:23,090
data in thirds and climate data and so on.

734
00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:27,740
Now what the team behind this that is
that taking that challenges that we should

735
00:42:27,741 --> 00:42:31,280
be able to model the biological world
in the same way we should know what's

736
00:42:31,281 --> 00:42:32,480
happened in the past.

737
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:36,830
We should be able to calculate what's
happening now and most importantly predict

738
00:42:36,831 --> 00:42:40,790
what's happening in the future based on
exactly the same scenarios that they're

739
00:42:40,791 --> 00:42:42,590
using for climate change and so on,

740
00:42:42,620 --> 00:42:45,650
which are usually based on things
like how many people there are,

741
00:42:45,830 --> 00:42:49,760
what you're doing with respect to
reforestation and carbon storage and what

742
00:42:49,761 --> 00:42:53,090
you're doing with respect
to burning fossil fuels and
songs and that's what that

743
00:42:53,091 --> 00:42:56,810
team have done so you can now show
us similar biodiversity curve,

744
00:42:56,811 --> 00:42:58,850
which from 1500 it goes along.

745
00:42:59,060 --> 00:43:03,650
It comes down in a really alarming fashion
as we spread our agricultural around

746
00:43:03,651 --> 00:43:05,930
the world,
which also drives this pattern here.

747
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:10,270
Then the different curves at the end
there that predict what would happen under

748
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:13,100
different future worlds.
They are really different.

749
00:43:13,550 --> 00:43:17,030
Some of them just continue to go down.
So you're heading,

750
00:43:17,090 --> 00:43:19,940
I would say you're heading there
towards an ecosystem crisis.

751
00:43:19,941 --> 00:43:22,760
You're going to get major
services collapsing,

752
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:26,840
but even under some of the models that
are being that are being used now,

753
00:43:26,870 --> 00:43:31,370
some of them are curving up within 50
years and one of the main drivers for that

754
00:43:31,371 --> 00:43:34,730
is about how we reforest and how
we look after carbon and so on.

755
00:43:35,180 --> 00:43:39,320
So there you can say to policymakers
instead of saying it's all a disaster,

756
00:43:39,321 --> 00:43:40,790
you're going to have to
spend a lot of money,

757
00:43:40,940 --> 00:43:43,910
but it's probably not during your term,
not very attractive.

758
00:43:44,090 --> 00:43:47,720
You can say you guys can save the world.
Look at this.

759
00:43:47,810 --> 00:43:52,430
If you reforest it in this way and
drove your fuel policies in this way,

760
00:43:52,460 --> 00:43:55,220
within 50 years people
are going to be having a,

761
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:58,670
people are going to be feeling
the difference on a global scale.

762
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:02,330
We haven't really been able to do that
before because suddenly it becomes a

763
00:44:02,331 --> 00:44:04,190
doable challenge and 50 years,
okay.

764
00:44:04,191 --> 00:44:07,970
It's outside the normal elections
and election cycle. Sure. Um,

765
00:44:08,060 --> 00:44:11,330
but I think 50 years is the sort of time
period that people realize that that's

766
00:44:11,331 --> 00:44:14,420
either me or my kids.
It's certainly my grandkids.

767
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:18,650
So it's a tangible period that you
can make a difference and it's, um,

768
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:21,470
and it's very visually
compelling when you do that.

769
00:44:21,471 --> 00:44:23,660
So I think that's one of
our challenges to present.

770
00:44:23,661 --> 00:44:28,130
So to find solutions and present them in
a way that policy makers can work with

771
00:44:28,131 --> 00:44:31,030
them. Wow. Great. And
we've got there from flies.

772
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:36,330
Other questions? Here we go. Um,

773
00:44:36,380 --> 00:44:38,150
so on that graph,
how come?

774
00:44:38,180 --> 00:44:41,600
Europe doesn't seem to be as devastated
as like Australia or America.

775
00:44:43,510 --> 00:44:47,860
Okay. So, um, can you guess
why Australia is bright red,

776
00:44:47,861 --> 00:44:49,420
particularly the central
of Australia there.

777
00:44:51,090 --> 00:44:51,440
Okay.

778
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:56,000
Ozone Layer. Sorry. Um, so, so why
was that and why climate change?

779
00:44:56,001 --> 00:44:56,850
One of the affects of sheep,

780
00:44:57,530 --> 00:45:00,920
sheep and rabbits have had an enormous
effect on the species that would live in

781
00:45:00,921 --> 00:45:05,450
Australia. So a few introduced
species buyers had devastated the bio,

782
00:45:05,540 --> 00:45:09,230
the bio terrain of the
middle of Australia. Um,

783
00:45:09,330 --> 00:45:12,110
so sometimes you get massive
effects like that. Um,

784
00:45:12,111 --> 00:45:16,220
you can see often it's
associated with that. The best,

785
00:45:16,370 --> 00:45:20,720
the best way usually of
destroying biodiversity is
to suddenly to have an area

786
00:45:20,721 --> 00:45:22,400
that's quite bad by diverse,

787
00:45:22,401 --> 00:45:27,401
rich and suddenly tried to increase
the gross domestic product of that area

788
00:45:28,310 --> 00:45:31,650
because then you basically just have to
take every resource out of that. Well,

789
00:45:31,670 --> 00:45:35,870
places like Europe, we're not an
enormously diverse area. We are,

790
00:45:35,930 --> 00:45:39,400
we have relatively protected
landscapes compared to some,

791
00:45:39,540 --> 00:45:43,360
so we still have some of our
biodiversity and left. Um,

792
00:45:43,430 --> 00:45:45,440
if you look across North America,

793
00:45:45,470 --> 00:45:47,900
you can see where that big
belt is through the middleware.

794
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:51,260
Anybody had the pleasure of driving
across the central of America.

795
00:45:51,350 --> 00:45:55,840
You can see what's kind of been going on
there. There's mass industrial size, um,

796
00:45:55,970 --> 00:45:58,970
agriculture, very difficult
for by domestic to cope with.

797
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:04,130
And it's thinks like the
advances in artificial nitrogen
fixing and productivity.

798
00:46:04,140 --> 00:46:05,270
You,
you alluded to that there,

799
00:46:05,271 --> 00:46:08,300
but it just tell us it has a bit more
about how those kinds of practices have

800
00:46:08,301 --> 00:46:09,920
affected this as far as you understand.

801
00:46:10,230 --> 00:46:13,740
Okay. So I mean, what's going to
affect this in the future? Um,

802
00:46:13,741 --> 00:46:17,550
a lot of this is to do with, um,
it's a couple of big effects.

803
00:46:17,610 --> 00:46:21,130
It's how many people you have around,
um,

804
00:46:21,270 --> 00:46:25,320
how will you control the climate
and how you manage those habitats.

805
00:46:25,710 --> 00:46:28,230
They're clearly that, you know,
from an environmental perspective,

806
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:32,620
the ideal thing is to have a
relatively low number of people, um,

807
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:37,770
to control the environment and then to
manage those habitats in a way that is

808
00:46:37,771 --> 00:46:41,520
relatively sustainable and it's achieving
the balance across those things.

809
00:46:41,521 --> 00:46:41,671
I mean,

810
00:46:41,671 --> 00:46:44,760
I don't think any of us are saying we
don't want to harvest new materials.

811
00:46:44,761 --> 00:46:47,970
If you look through, for example,
South America, there you can,

812
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:51,000
one of the challenges with the
changes in Colombia, for example,

813
00:46:51,660 --> 00:46:54,570
absolutely amazing
biodiversity in Colombia.

814
00:46:55,050 --> 00:46:58,590
One of the reasons it probably exists
in some areas is it would be far too

815
00:46:58,591 --> 00:47:01,860
dangerous to go in there. You know, I've
discussed with them in the past thing.

816
00:47:02,100 --> 00:47:03,930
How about we explore
there and how about we,

817
00:47:03,931 --> 00:47:07,490
it's going to say you do not want to go
through that valley with your binoculars

818
00:47:07,491 --> 00:47:11,700
and you'll, you know little, you're
welcome. Yeah. So in those sorts of,

819
00:47:11,790 --> 00:47:16,740
there's also amazing minerals in Colombia
which will power the technologies that

820
00:47:16,741 --> 00:47:18,540
a lot of us are dependent upon.

821
00:47:18,541 --> 00:47:21,270
That's where the new batteries and then
new screens and so on are going to come

822
00:47:21,271 --> 00:47:22,320
from and those sorts of things.

823
00:47:22,630 --> 00:47:25,890
And our challenge is to try to be
able to extract those minerals in a

824
00:47:25,891 --> 00:47:29,500
sustainable way but keep the bone
adversity as intact as possible.

825
00:47:29,740 --> 00:47:34,090
That's really challenging,
but it's very conspicuous that already,

826
00:47:34,091 --> 00:47:36,700
since those deals are starting
to happen in Colombia,

827
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:39,580
they are over here talking to
us about exactly how to do that.

828
00:47:39,820 --> 00:47:44,820
So you're talking about major areas
of South America where you can make a

829
00:47:44,891 --> 00:47:48,790
difference about how biodiversity is
going to go there in the next 10 years or

830
00:47:48,791 --> 00:47:52,030
so. Really excited, but they
need data to, it's good.

831
00:47:52,060 --> 00:47:56,050
It's going to be a data driven solution
that thereafter. Other questions?

832
00:47:57,480 --> 00:48:02,200
Hi, it's my wife is a zoological
research fellow and uh,

833
00:48:02,460 --> 00:48:06,880
at the various universities she's gone
to the state of the art for recording

834
00:48:06,881 --> 00:48:11,250
data tends to be an excel
spreadsheet at the top end. Um,

835
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:14,240
reducing down to,
she does bird rain,

836
00:48:14,290 --> 00:48:18,730
bird ringing and bartering is often just
recorded on scraps of paper which are

837
00:48:18,940 --> 00:48:20,890
mailed it to each other.
Um,

838
00:48:20,950 --> 00:48:25,270
what can we do and what can
you do to help improve the, uh,

839
00:48:25,670 --> 00:48:30,250
the recording and the sharing of high
quality data from the academic community?

840
00:48:30,780 --> 00:48:33,120
So I think,
I mean I'll try and answer that one.

841
00:48:33,121 --> 00:48:36,750
I think fundamentally it's platforms
is building platforms that support the

842
00:48:36,751 --> 00:48:38,160
acquisition of that data.

843
00:48:38,310 --> 00:48:41,430
The fact that it needs to be done
offline because many of the places where

844
00:48:41,431 --> 00:48:44,490
people are doing that recording,
they don't have digital connectivity.

845
00:48:44,790 --> 00:48:48,840
The synchronization and integration of
that data is a big challenge. Um, so yeah,

846
00:48:48,841 --> 00:48:49,650
I,
I,

847
00:48:49,650 --> 00:48:53,880
I feel your pain to some degree because
I've been involved in that community for

848
00:48:53,881 --> 00:48:55,530
quite some time.
Um,

849
00:48:55,800 --> 00:49:00,510
often there are communities of practice
that are quite as difficult to change.

850
00:49:00,511 --> 00:49:04,410
There's a cultural problem there as well
in terms of trying to shift people away

851
00:49:04,411 --> 00:49:08,790
from bits of paper to recording
things natively. Uh, digitally.

852
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:11,940
There's also issues about
devices when you bring devices,

853
00:49:11,941 --> 00:49:13,860
particularly into some parts of the field,

854
00:49:14,220 --> 00:49:17,010
you know that they're going
to get wet is extremely hot.

855
00:49:17,010 --> 00:49:20,520
It's humid a or sometimes
it's freezing cold. Um,

856
00:49:20,550 --> 00:49:24,780
the issue about connectivity is there's
also critical is we've had to in some

857
00:49:24,781 --> 00:49:28,860
cases build really big
temporary wifi networks.

858
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:31,830
We do some work in Lyme,
Regis and just on the beach.

859
00:49:31,860 --> 00:49:34,140
There is no good connectivity.

860
00:49:34,260 --> 00:49:38,580
So you need to put in basic infrastructure
like a wifi network just to be able

861
00:49:38,581 --> 00:49:43,260
to get citizens to help recording and
documenting, um, uh, what's on the beach.

862
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:48,060
So I think Google, uh,
organizations like ourselves,

863
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:51,860
other natural history based
organizations in the UK, uh,

864
00:49:51,870 --> 00:49:55,290
have a key role in trying to, um, uh,

865
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:57,090
build those systems,

866
00:49:57,091 --> 00:50:01,800
those platforms to try and deliver
that transition toward digital.

867
00:50:02,010 --> 00:50:05,520
But it's, it's a, it's a challenge
partly because it's a cultural thing.

868
00:50:05,550 --> 00:50:07,110
It's not really a technology thing.

869
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:12,890
Another question here, I
think. Yeah, thanks. Um,

870
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:16,580
so we were talking about environmental
policy before and I guess one of the

871
00:50:16,581 --> 00:50:20,720
biggest challenges is that it only really
works is if all the countries around

872
00:50:20,721 --> 00:50:24,260
the word work together and
pull in the same direction.

873
00:50:24,830 --> 00:50:28,220
And I guess is this something
you're trying do by making

874
00:50:28,220 --> 00:50:33,220
your collection available online or
how can we use that to convince people

875
00:50:34,110 --> 00:50:36,590
around the word? So, uh,

876
00:50:36,591 --> 00:50:40,580
there is a very strong link between
all those natural history collections

877
00:50:40,581 --> 00:50:44,480
worldwide. It tends to start, it tends
to be kind of at the continental level,

878
00:50:44,481 --> 00:50:46,850
predominantly the conversations.
So for example,

879
00:50:46,851 --> 00:50:49,040
I sit on an organization
called [inaudible],

880
00:50:49,100 --> 00:50:51,800
the consortium of European
taxonomic facilities,

881
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:56,120
which represents the 50 major natural
history collections across about 20

882
00:50:56,121 --> 00:50:57,230
countries in Europe.

883
00:50:57,470 --> 00:51:01,670
And we talk constantly about basically
how we can share technologies.

884
00:51:01,790 --> 00:51:06,520
We can develop a common
agenda, uh, to, um, uh, to, to,

885
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:08,480
to basically provide the data,

886
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:11,960
the platforms or systems to make
this kind of science possible.

887
00:51:12,170 --> 00:51:15,770
So I would say at that level
there's very good communication.

888
00:51:15,980 --> 00:51:18,350
I think where the is
perhaps slightly less,

889
00:51:18,351 --> 00:51:21,830
but obviously us being here today is a
good example of where we're trying to

890
00:51:21,831 --> 00:51:26,540
bridge that is with the commercial sector
and with technology organizations who

891
00:51:26,541 --> 00:51:31,541
can really have a pivotal role in helping
us to make that leap towards making

892
00:51:32,751 --> 00:51:34,490
this content more accessible,

893
00:51:34,610 --> 00:51:37,760
more digital and support the underlying.

894
00:51:37,910 --> 00:51:40,220
It provides some of the
underlying infrastructure,

895
00:51:40,430 --> 00:51:43,250
which is quite hard for us
to provide individually.

896
00:51:43,460 --> 00:51:47,540
But through organizations like Google,
there is a potential to um, to provide,

897
00:51:47,890 --> 00:51:49,590
let me get,
let's give you that opportunity then.

898
00:51:49,591 --> 00:51:53,520
What would be the questions you'd ask of
us as a partner in some of that journey?

899
00:51:53,521 --> 00:51:55,910
Where can you see that we have
the most potential to be held?

900
00:51:55,950 --> 00:51:56,550
Cool.

901
00:51:56,550 --> 00:52:00,480
So I mean I think there's a number of
them are probably the three big ones are

902
00:52:00,780 --> 00:52:01,710
digitization,

903
00:52:01,950 --> 00:52:05,610
just simply trying to exploit some of
the digitization technologies that you've

904
00:52:05,611 --> 00:52:09,930
got. Obviously you have enormous
experience with the book digitization.

905
00:52:10,140 --> 00:52:13,890
This is quite a different proposition in
one sense, but there are many parallels.

906
00:52:13,891 --> 00:52:18,480
So that's one. I think the foundational
platforms, the hosting, the storage,

907
00:52:18,660 --> 00:52:20,100
the cloud infrastructure,

908
00:52:20,340 --> 00:52:23,550
that's a big challenge for us
because it's truly global. But again,

909
00:52:23,551 --> 00:52:25,140
it's an area where Google can help.

910
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:29,640
And I think the other big one is helping
us to demonstrate the potential of a

911
00:52:29,641 --> 00:52:33,180
lot of this digital content. And that's
where I think the machine learning,

912
00:52:33,181 --> 00:52:35,220
the computer vision,
the um,

913
00:52:35,380 --> 00:52:40,380
technologies that can help us to exploit
and extract data from all of this

914
00:52:40,771 --> 00:52:44,550
imagery that we're data generating.
That's the third big area. I think

915
00:52:44,890 --> 00:52:47,380
that's it. It sounds like that
third area splits into sort of the,

916
00:52:47,410 --> 00:52:50,560
the intelligent extrapolations and so
on that can engage in the policy and

917
00:52:50,561 --> 00:52:55,030
public fund as well as the captivating
animations that that bring in.

918
00:52:55,390 --> 00:52:56,850
Absolutely.
So we can engage

919
00:52:56,910 --> 00:52:57,180
snapchat,

920
00:52:57,180 --> 00:53:01,850
accomplish and do the science and really
tell the public about that science

921
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:04,960
and see, hey, is here from the Cultural
Institute team you want to get,

922
00:53:04,961 --> 00:53:07,510
just give a wave. So if people
want to sort of say, Hey,

923
00:53:07,511 --> 00:53:10,180
I'd love to help follow up on this,
then that's the place to,

924
00:53:10,210 --> 00:53:12,540
that's the place to talk.
Any final questions from anybody?

925
00:53:12,550 --> 00:53:13,660
We're about to be out of time.

926
00:53:15,940 --> 00:53:16,570
Yeah.

927
00:53:16,570 --> 00:53:19,720
Okay. So I have a, I have a
final question. Uh, you know, it,

928
00:53:19,721 --> 00:53:23,680
given where you are in your field and
the progress that you're seeing made,

929
00:53:23,681 --> 00:53:26,910
what would you predict it in sort
of 10 years is going to have been a

930
00:53:26,911 --> 00:53:29,590
breakthrough, uh, that's,
that could be achieved in,

931
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:32,090
in any of the fields that
you're working in. Where,

932
00:53:32,100 --> 00:53:33,120
where do you see that there's some,

933
00:53:33,220 --> 00:53:35,550
some potential for something
significant to change?

934
00:53:35,750 --> 00:53:39,860
I think definitely for me it's the
potential force and species or times on

935
00:53:39,861 --> 00:53:41,510
recognition and images.

936
00:53:41,540 --> 00:53:46,430
I think that's going to
be truly transformative to
the kind of science that we

937
00:53:46,431 --> 00:53:51,431
can do because it empowers people who
are frankly not necessarily very informed

938
00:53:51,831 --> 00:53:56,260
about the natural world to suddenly
be able to record and document it.

939
00:53:56,270 --> 00:54:01,270
If we can automatically do things like
identify species from that imagery that

940
00:54:01,371 --> 00:54:04,700
has a revolutionizes fieldwork,
for example,

941
00:54:04,850 --> 00:54:08,480
imagine the fact that we have to send
physically lots of people out to these

942
00:54:08,481 --> 00:54:11,540
sometimes very dangerous
places to do that work.

943
00:54:11,780 --> 00:54:16,100
We can basically put devices into those
places and do that recording in an

944
00:54:16,101 --> 00:54:17,120
automated way.

945
00:54:17,270 --> 00:54:21,170
We can do things like identify when
new things that we didn't know about.

946
00:54:21,171 --> 00:54:24,450
I've come into a region when things that,
um,

947
00:54:24,650 --> 00:54:29,080
maybe some of those are new species,
maybe some of those things are um, uh, uh,

948
00:54:29,180 --> 00:54:32,780
things that we simply didn't know were
there that is going to have a huge

949
00:54:32,900 --> 00:54:36,470
transformative impact I think on
how we understand the natural world.

950
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:39,790
Well so that the entire planet becomes
your collection. Exactly. Yeah.

951
00:54:40,890 --> 00:54:42,080
Do you have a similar view?

952
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:46,900
Um, I'll have to be a bit
different from Vince. I agree
with that. That's, you know,

953
00:54:47,070 --> 00:54:50,860
the new expedition, the
new global expedition using
new technologies and stuff.

954
00:54:51,380 --> 00:54:54,830
The one thing I would add to what we've
spoken about so far is everything we've

955
00:54:54,831 --> 00:54:58,370
just spoken about now you also
link that to genomic information.

956
00:54:58,490 --> 00:55:02,270
So we also want to understand how
life evolves and how it works. Now,

957
00:55:02,870 --> 00:55:05,990
I would say that you guys would
probably know more about this than me,

958
00:55:05,991 --> 00:55:10,250
but if you think about, um, where we
are in terms of digital technology, um,

959
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:14,390
genomes have been going along
a similar trajectory. The old,

960
00:55:14,630 --> 00:55:18,140
the old approach was kind of let's try
and get one genome for one species.

961
00:55:18,170 --> 00:55:22,580
We've done it. Now we've got um,
genomes for maybe a hundred species,

962
00:55:22,940 --> 00:55:25,920
jolly good. Now we're starting
to do a little bit of population.

963
00:55:25,921 --> 00:55:30,830
So a thousand or 10,000 humans get a bit
of variety in there. Really exciting is,

964
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:35,360
but in the same way as technology has got
faster and better in the digital realm

965
00:55:35,361 --> 00:55:38,930
and cheaper exactly the same as
happened in the genomic realm as well.

966
00:55:39,140 --> 00:55:41,570
So now we're into biodiversity genomics.

967
00:55:41,930 --> 00:55:45,380
So you look at the forms of all the
different animals and plants around you.

968
00:55:45,390 --> 00:55:48,950
We want to understand how that happened
and what it means for their evolution

969
00:55:49,130 --> 00:55:51,440
and again,
for their responses to future change.

970
00:55:51,740 --> 00:55:55,160
So there's a big database over
there that's growing really rapidly,

971
00:55:55,430 --> 00:55:58,970
all about genomes. This is where a
lot of the information is actually,

972
00:55:58,990 --> 00:56:02,810
the biological information is thought.
We've got to link those two together,

973
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:05,000
and I think there's going to
be a lot of fun doing that.

974
00:56:05,230 --> 00:56:08,830
Well, I want to say thank you for
enduring my simplistic questions,

975
00:56:08,831 --> 00:56:13,831
but there's a real sense here of a field
that is ready for a big acceleration at

976
00:56:15,431 --> 00:56:17,440
a time,
which we probably need it more than ever.

977
00:56:17,441 --> 00:56:19,060
So I want to say a big
thank you to doctor.

978
00:56:19,061 --> 00:56:23,050
Ian owns doctor Vince Smith for all their
time and for our partnership with the

979
00:56:23,050 --> 00:56:23,710
Natural History Museum.
Thank you very much.
