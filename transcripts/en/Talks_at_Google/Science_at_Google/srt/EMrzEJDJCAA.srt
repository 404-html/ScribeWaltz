1
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:11,460
I am very excited to introduce Diana
cower and Diana is creator of the Youtube

2
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:15,790
Channel Physics girl. She grew up
driving tractors on a farm in Hawaii.

3
00:00:15,791 --> 00:00:17,380
I think you were just in Hawaii.
Uh,

4
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:22,510
surfing's scuba diving and playing
the Ukulele. Ukulele today. I'm,

5
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:25,630
I apologize for that.
And with that training,

6
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:28,120
found your way to science
and engineering pursuits,

7
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:30,760
nicknamed happy pants in college.

8
00:00:30,761 --> 00:00:35,761
I have no idea why Diana research dark
matter with Professor Jasleen Monroe as

9
00:00:37,121 --> 00:00:42,121
an Undergrad at MIT and low
Mattel mentalities stars
with professor and Friable

10
00:00:42,341 --> 00:00:47,341
as a post baccalaureate research fellow
at the Harvard Smithsonian Center for

11
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:49,150
Astrophysics.
Say That 10 times fast.

12
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:53,080
She worked as a software engineering
intern at GE designing mobile apps and at

13
00:00:53,081 --> 00:00:56,920
Uc San Diego was a science outreach
coordinator before ultimately becoming,

14
00:00:56,921 --> 00:01:01,120
you tube's physics girl fulltime.
Please welcome Diana to Google.

15
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:06,070
[inaudible]

16
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,830
I had really colorful pants. All
that's why I did. I had a pair of like,

17
00:01:10,831 --> 00:01:14,370
they looked like hippie pants and so
one of my friends called me happy events

18
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:16,900
because of that. Excellent.
I did not know me now.

19
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:19,920
So, uh, this is definitely applied
to me when I was in high school.

20
00:01:19,921 --> 00:01:23,340
Physics can send terror in the hearts
of many high school students and is a

21
00:01:23,341 --> 00:01:28,110
really broad discipline.
Just like engineering is a
very blood, broad discipline.

22
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,110
How would you describe physics
to a middle schooler or

23
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,840
a middle schooler?
That was,

24
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:36,900
I don't want to think about
that as a rough time in my life.

25
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:40,700
I think it's a rough time for
everybody's like everybody. Yeah.

26
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:44,540
So the thing about physics,
like I think when,

27
00:01:44,541 --> 00:01:46,890
when you think about physics as a class,

28
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:50,880
do you think about like the equations,
like you know,

29
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:55,140
Newton's equations and you think about
if you push something with a certain

30
00:01:55,141 --> 00:01:59,340
forest, you're going to get a certain
acceleration. Um, but that like,

31
00:01:59,341 --> 00:02:04,110
it just sounds so lame when you
describe physics like that. For me,

32
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:07,440
physics is like, it's like all the
things that you're interested in.

33
00:02:07,441 --> 00:02:09,130
So for a middle schooler it's,
I dunno,

34
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:12,690
like they're interested in their
crushes and they're interested in like,

35
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:16,380
like a sports maybe or their interests
that they're starting to get, you know,

36
00:02:16,381 --> 00:02:18,960
makeup, curious or things like that. Um,

37
00:02:18,961 --> 00:02:23,961
so take some of those things like sports
and a soccer ball will curve because of

38
00:02:25,051 --> 00:02:28,980
physics. You can explain that with
physics and then even like even makeup,

39
00:02:28,981 --> 00:02:33,720
you can explain iridescence the same way
that you explain how a butterfly wing

40
00:02:33,721 --> 00:02:38,721
works or why I'm thin films like
spilled oil looks kind of shiny.

41
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:43,770
Like you can explain it these everyday
things with physics and then take all

42
00:02:43,771 --> 00:02:46,740
that and make something that
middleschoolers couldn't
live without like their

43
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:51,690
smartphone. Um, then on the other
side of it, there's, you know,

44
00:02:51,691 --> 00:02:53,130
there's this like application stuff.

45
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:56,670
Then there's like completely
useless stuff that's really cool.

46
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:01,460
Like the fact that stars can just
explode supernovas and then become black

47
00:03:01,461 --> 00:03:05,680
holes. How does that work? Physics will
tell you. And then there's like, you know,

48
00:03:05,681 --> 00:03:09,730
there's, there's the fact that a ball is
really, really, if it's really smooth,

49
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:12,760
you can kick it the same way and
it'll Kern the opposite direction,

50
00:03:12,761 --> 00:03:16,850
which is really cool to see. I've
got a video on it. Um, so like,

51
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:21,230
so physics does this, it's like
the useful and the useless. It,

52
00:03:21,231 --> 00:03:23,710
it explains all this stuff in our world.

53
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:26,050
Like in literally explains
why the sky is blue

54
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,870
and going to the other
end of the spectrum now.

55
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:34,160
So why should those in Washington and
political power that control the budgets

56
00:03:34,161 --> 00:03:36,080
of public research care about physics?

57
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:37,320
I mean,
I think that the,

58
00:03:37,321 --> 00:03:41,490
the typical answer that you would hear
to this question is something like,

59
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:46,740
all of the advancements we've had in
stem and technology and engineering and

60
00:03:46,741 --> 00:03:48,050
science,
um,

61
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:52,530
have often been thought of as like
kind of interesting but not necessarily

62
00:03:52,531 --> 00:03:53,100
useful.

63
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:57,690
Like the light bulb is one of the most
famous inventions that people thought was

64
00:03:57,691 --> 00:04:01,020
useless that we would never
actually need like candles there.

65
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:05,700
They're good enough, you
know. Um, but, but for me,

66
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:06,960
for me personally,

67
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:12,470
I think that that like as art is just
good enough for the sake of having arts in

68
00:04:14,401 --> 00:04:18,600
our lives, the same is true of like
the pursue of fundamental science.

69
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:23,350
So humans have been curious about
our world. Like how, you know,

70
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:27,360
we ask tons of questions all the
time, like all of us, I know you do,

71
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,450
we were just like curious about our world.

72
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:34,020
And this has been part of being a human,

73
00:04:34,021 --> 00:04:37,440
it's been part of the human
experience and civilization started.

74
00:04:37,441 --> 00:04:42,441
So for me that's enough of a reason to
give funding and to pursue scientific

75
00:04:43,861 --> 00:04:45,190
research. Sure. Yeah.

76
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,640
Well I survived computer engineering in
university and struggled a bit through

77
00:04:48,641 --> 00:04:49,510
physics in high school.

78
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:52,840
What advice do you have for students
who are struggling to grasp physics

79
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,740
concepts? Probably more at the high school
level before they run off to college.

80
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:57,510
Well,
I would say

81
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,710
in addition to watching your videos,
which really does help. Yes, yes.

82
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:05,290
That's what my videos are not going to
teach you how to do your homework as much

83
00:05:05,291 --> 00:05:09,830
as you email me with your homework
problems trying to ask. Um,

84
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:13,270
um,
I would say,

85
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:19,410
I would say that that,
yeah, physics like it's not,

86
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:20,710
it's never going to be easy.

87
00:05:20,711 --> 00:05:24,220
Physics really is math heavy
when you get deep into it.

88
00:05:24,221 --> 00:05:27,010
But like any kind of learning,

89
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:30,100
I think you have to learn how
to be a student more than you.

90
00:05:30,101 --> 00:05:34,450
I have to learn the material first.
So if you're starting a class,

91
00:05:34,451 --> 00:05:38,530
you'd probably want to take a look
through the syllabus and find your own

92
00:05:38,531 --> 00:05:42,640
questions, like find what you are curious
about and that's the best way to learn.

93
00:05:42,641 --> 00:05:43,990
So when I do my videos,

94
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:49,350
I learned so well because I have these
questions and I'm curious and that's why

95
00:05:49,611 --> 00:05:52,120
I choose that video topic. So like, yeah,

96
00:05:52,121 --> 00:05:55,630
as a student you can have a teacher or
a parent that's going to tell you what's

97
00:05:55,631 --> 00:05:58,490
interesting and what you
need learn and they like,

98
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:01,520
you're going to take this class because
this is what's important for you to know,

99
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:05,510
but like take it back into your own hands,
like take control of your learning.

100
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:06,830
I looked through that syllabus,

101
00:06:06,831 --> 00:06:11,000
find some questions that you're
interested in and you're curious about and

102
00:06:11,001 --> 00:06:13,580
that's going to help guide your
learning through the class.

103
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:15,130
I think this ties this next question,

104
00:06:15,131 --> 00:06:19,360
which is at some point physics went from
being a credit you had to get to being

105
00:06:19,361 --> 00:06:21,370
really cool. Maybe that
happened really early. So what,

106
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:24,430
what made physics called high school
and Cooler once you got to college?

107
00:06:24,431 --> 00:06:26,830
What were these questions that were
really burning in your mind that physics

108
00:06:26,831 --> 00:06:27,664
started to answer?

109
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:31,680
Well, physics was always
cool for me. Like since I've,

110
00:06:31,681 --> 00:06:36,110
since I took my first physics class,
it was like, this is it. Ah, um,

111
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:40,530
but I th I think probably there,

112
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:44,060
there were a ton of questions
that physics answered for me. Um,

113
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:47,850
starting with things
like why is the sky blue?

114
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:51,120
Like I found out that that blue
light scatters more and I was like,

115
00:06:51,121 --> 00:06:51,901
well that's Kinda cool.

116
00:06:51,901 --> 00:06:56,901
I found out in the process that the sun
emits all of the colors of visible light

117
00:06:56,911 --> 00:06:59,670
in addition to some of these
other colors that are not visible.

118
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:04,830
I thought that was fascinating when I
first learned that x-rays and microwaves

119
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:09,860
and gamma rays and radio waves are all
the same thing is as visible light,

120
00:07:10,021 --> 00:07:13,320
which is, which is a thing that I still
haven't got my parents to fully grasp,

121
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:17,670
but I'm trying. But when I first learned
that, I was like, you're kidding me.

122
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:21,330
Are you like, it's all light. It
haul, it has the same properties.

123
00:07:21,331 --> 00:07:25,290
It's like the same phenomenon is just
that we can't see it. That was cool.

124
00:07:25,291 --> 00:07:28,420
I was like,
these are things about our world that the,

125
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:32,310
I didn't know that a lot of people
don't know, but physics knows,

126
00:07:32,311 --> 00:07:35,550
like we've discovered as you know,
throughout humanity,

127
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:38,190
as scientists and as curious persons,

128
00:07:38,191 --> 00:07:42,080
we've discovered all these interesting
things about the world. Wait,

129
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:43,920
I had some really
awesome physics teachers,

130
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:48,000
so never underestimate the value
of like, you know, what you can,

131
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:52,740
when you can do to instill the curiosity
and the excitement on the young people

132
00:07:52,741 --> 00:07:53,350
in your life.

133
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:55,850
And maybe that's if you were
talking to other physics teachers,

134
00:07:55,851 --> 00:07:58,910
what about those teachers
you had made them so amazing?

135
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:02,550
I wouldn't say excitement
was a huge part of it.

136
00:08:02,551 --> 00:08:06,980
Like I tell this story all
the time, but Cathy Jones, oh,

137
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:10,380
she was like miss frizzle
but like really cool. Um,

138
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:14,280
she had a ton of
experiments going on during,

139
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:16,980
during like the breaks
during recess of our classes.

140
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:20,970
So she had this one where she had a block
of ice and then a cord going over the

141
00:08:20,971 --> 00:08:23,190
top of the ice and weights on either side.

142
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:26,670
And then you wait throughout the day
and we would come back in throughout the

143
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:27,510
day and see the cord,

144
00:08:27,511 --> 00:08:30,600
like cutting through the ice and
then refreezing over the top.

145
00:08:30,601 --> 00:08:34,650
So like midway through the day you've got
an ice block with a cord going through

146
00:08:34,651 --> 00:08:35,461
the middle of it,

147
00:08:35,461 --> 00:08:39,600
just from the pressure pushing down and
cutting through the ice is cool stuff.

148
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:42,300
So she was like, come and see
this all the time. Come share it.

149
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:46,800
And that's something that I have
not done as much in my life.

150
00:08:46,801 --> 00:08:48,660
But now being a science communicator,

151
00:08:48,661 --> 00:08:52,410
I've realized like how important it is
when you're with young people to share

152
00:08:52,411 --> 00:08:55,300
something you're passionate about.
Like I dunno,

153
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,900
carry around a little experiment
or something and be like,

154
00:08:57,901 --> 00:09:00,600
when when you're with a little kid
and be like, hey, come check this out.

155
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:05,070
Like not in a creepy way. Just like,
just like, like this is cool. Like,

156
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:09,480
Oh, okay, I've got these earrings
on. Sorry, I'm getting excited.

157
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:11,130
I've got these hearings on that.

158
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,600
We'll have to do a show until after
they're there, like shrunken dime.

159
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:19,500
Oh, cool. Yeah. From the video
you did on that. Yes. Cool.
Video. Go check it out. Yeah.

160
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:23,540
So like I really like wearing
these because every once
in a while I get to take

161
00:09:23,541 --> 00:09:25,460
them off and show a little
kid because they're like,

162
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:30,070
they're shrunken by a giant electromagnet.
Um, put it in the middle of,

163
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:32,570
of the electromagnet and
it shrinks the quarter.

164
00:09:32,571 --> 00:09:36,530
So you're like literally using a
magnet to create current and shrink.

165
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:39,500
Well it was originally a
quarter. These were dimes. Um,

166
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:43,490
but I mean earrings out of them so I
could always carry around my lens with me.

167
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:48,690
Very cool. And that ties into this cool
new video. You published a this morning,

168
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:53,550
um, which includes a maker style
project for a lightening generator. I,

169
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:56,730
I've already promised my daughter
we're going to do this summer.

170
00:09:57,630 --> 00:10:00,840
How was pursuing science help you wrestle
through tough problems without giving

171
00:10:00,841 --> 00:10:04,470
up? Cause he your video giving you
a lawyer a little bit, you know,

172
00:10:04,471 --> 00:10:05,700
you see the video of the end result.

173
00:10:05,701 --> 00:10:09,000
You don't see the three days of struggling
to make this thing actually works at

174
00:10:09,001 --> 00:10:12,150
what have you learned how to science
taught you to persevere? Maybe a dog.

175
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:13,780
Oh, lovely. And more, well,

176
00:10:13,781 --> 00:10:18,781
I conveniently deleted the three days of
footage where we struggled on accident.

177
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:23,440
It wasn't convenient. It was
really sad. Anyways. Um, so yeah,

178
00:10:23,441 --> 00:10:27,520
this video was a homemade capacitor.
So is it a cake pan?

179
00:10:27,521 --> 00:10:30,700
On the bottom is the bottom plate and
then a piece of polycarbonate for the

180
00:10:30,701 --> 00:10:32,080
dielectric. And then, uh, uh,

181
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:35,800
a bowl with a piece of sheet metal on
the top for the top plate and then you

182
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:38,800
charge it up by using a PVC pipe.
Um,

183
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:42,880
we struggled a lot with not having
any innuendos in this video because,

184
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:44,440
because the PVC pipe,

185
00:10:44,441 --> 00:10:47,920
you have to rub it with a paper towel
back and forth and then deposit charge

186
00:10:47,921 --> 00:10:51,670
onto the bowl over and over. So, um,

187
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:55,570
something I've struggled with in
my channel on Youtube, you know,

188
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:59,890
this inviting platform, but, um, anyways,

189
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:03,610
I'm going off on a random tangent.
Bring the train back.

190
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:08,040
So this was a really,
really fun experiment. Um,

191
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:12,010
but we struggled a lot with it because
the video that we saw that inspired us to

192
00:11:12,011 --> 00:11:15,310
do this, how did like a 10 inch spark
when you discharge the capacitor?

193
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:17,770
And we were like, yeah, we're going
to do that. It's going to be great.

194
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:22,990
And our first mark was like half
an inch and we're just like, why?

195
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:25,570
Why is that not working?
So we went through this process,

196
00:11:25,571 --> 00:11:27,370
we found out things like even the,

197
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:31,750
like the little lip on the bowl we were
using was leaking a little bit of charge.

198
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:33,820
Um,
so we had to use a smoother bowl,

199
00:11:33,821 --> 00:11:38,821
like so many neat little nitpicky things
that experimentalists would know better

200
00:11:38,891 --> 00:11:43,330
than theorists. Um, so
it was, yeah, I think,

201
00:11:43,331 --> 00:11:45,430
I think that this video for me was,

202
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:49,390
was a really good way to bring it
back to something that I love doing,

203
00:11:49,391 --> 00:11:53,380
which is like problem solving,
learning through experience,

204
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:57,250
like spending a lot of time on something
and really trying to make it better.

205
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:02,080
In the end, we didn't get 10 inches. We
got four inches. Very cool. Awesome spark.

206
00:12:02,081 --> 00:12:04,660
Yeah.
But we also happen to do this and like,

207
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:09,250
like historical rainy conditions
for San Diego. So like,

208
00:12:09,251 --> 00:12:13,360
it's the middle of the, like the rainiest
month on, you know, the last few decades.

209
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,820
And we're trying to do static
electricity experiments.

210
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:18,360
Arizona.
This is going to be even cooler.

211
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:23,160
Yes. Or if you're somewhere cold right
now, like even in Tahoe or something,

212
00:12:23,161 --> 00:12:25,260
it's probably a really good
time to do the experiment.

213
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:28,520
So anyone out there that does this
experiment Hashtag and send your video on

214
00:12:28,521 --> 00:12:29,790
youtube to Diana.
Yes.

215
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,330
If you can beat my four inches,

216
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:36,650
you won't win a like or
subscribe or something. Sure. Uh,

217
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:40,120
so a close friend of mine is a physics
professor at Uc Irvine where he works on

218
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:42,440
longterm research and high energy,
high energy physics.

219
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,710
I'm always impressed by
the years of dedication.

220
00:12:45,711 --> 00:12:47,840
Physicist applied are
really hard problems.

221
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:50,510
What is the most exciting
research you were following?

222
00:12:50,511 --> 00:12:53,300
The could possibly reach a conclusion
in your lifetime or maybe not.

223
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:58,260
Yeah, I mean, I, I'm really shocked that,

224
00:12:58,710 --> 00:13:03,710
that in the last couple years we've had
the discovery of the Higgs Boson and

225
00:13:03,991 --> 00:13:06,480
then, uh, gravitational waves.

226
00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:10,590
I'm guessing you guys have some nods if
you've heard of both of those. Awesome.

227
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:15,430
Yes. Um, so some gravitational waves
was something that I had heard about in,

228
00:13:15,431 --> 00:13:18,030
in Undergrad. And they're like,
yeah, well they're working on Lego,

229
00:13:18,031 --> 00:13:19,230
they're working on this detector.

230
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:23,550
And some of the professors that I studied
with were working on Lego and I was

231
00:13:23,551 --> 00:13:25,500
like, wow, like this is really exciting.

232
00:13:25,530 --> 00:13:29,070
Maybe in 20 years we're going to get
a detection and we're going to get the

233
00:13:29,071 --> 00:13:32,790
discovery of gravitational waves.
But we have like,

234
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,610
that's so it's so exciting.
Like those,

235
00:13:35,611 --> 00:13:38,280
those are the kinds of things I follow
are like the big discoveries that

236
00:13:38,281 --> 00:13:41,430
actually make it to the um,

237
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:46,230
main stream news I guess. Yeah.
But, but in addition to that,

238
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,240
some of this stuff that I have worked on,

239
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:52,260
it's probably biases me to put paid
more attention to that research.

240
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:57,120
So like I worked on a dark
matter detection experiment
and so we're hoping to

241
00:13:57,121 --> 00:14:00,630
detect dark matter sometime soon.

242
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:03,360
Hopefully in my lifetime
it may not happen,

243
00:14:03,361 --> 00:14:06,510
but I think that's the next
gravitational waves. You know,

244
00:14:06,511 --> 00:14:09,450
like if we could detect it'd be bigger,
it would be huge.

245
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:13,440
If we could detect dark matter
that would be like, you know,

246
00:14:13,441 --> 00:14:17,070
like the gravitational wave detection.
It would just be amazing. Um,

247
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:22,400
I also worked on Lowman illicitly
stars, so like focusing on, uh,

248
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:26,310
the early universe. So
if we can, you know,

249
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:31,390
we'll learn more about like how stars
evolved as we discover more stars and look

250
00:14:32,131 --> 00:14:36,570
further back into the oldest
stars. That'll be really
exciting. Yeah. Just so much.

251
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,433
There's too much.

252
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:43,310
So, uh, I'm going to start pivoting
now to your becoming a youtuber and,

253
00:14:43,311 --> 00:14:47,150
uh, this is the timely, since when I'm
in recent videos, your dad was in it.

254
00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:52,100
Very cool. He was struck by lightning
twice, twice. That's a cool video. Yeah.

255
00:14:52,101 --> 00:14:54,280
I wouldn't want to
recreate that particular,

256
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:58,730
so I imagine the conversation with your
family that you've graduated from Mit

257
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:01,670
with a degree in physics and planned
to become a youtube creator would be an

258
00:15:01,671 --> 00:15:04,080
interesting conversation.
Um,

259
00:15:04,090 --> 00:15:07,580
imagine the path from MIT graduate
youtube creator was not a straight line,

260
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:10,310
probably had many dips in the polls
and the failures along the way.

261
00:15:10,311 --> 00:15:11,450
What path did you take?

262
00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:17,570
Yeah, so, um, yeah, my parents were not
super excited. They were like, okay,

263
00:15:17,571 --> 00:15:21,530
hold up,
like we have to pay for this,

264
00:15:21,531 --> 00:15:23,420
this degree from Mit.

265
00:15:23,421 --> 00:15:26,750
Like I think that they thought that I
made pretty good life decisions up until

266
00:15:26,751 --> 00:15:29,690
the point when I got my degree.
And then I was like, well,

267
00:15:29,691 --> 00:15:32,010
I'm starting a youtube channel.
And I think like,

268
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:36,350
she probably thought that it was like
going to Hollywood or like maybe like a

269
00:15:36,351 --> 00:15:39,170
reality TV show on,
on TV or something.

270
00:15:39,171 --> 00:15:43,430
I don't think she thought very
highly of a youtube career. Um,

271
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:46,310
and it's not like I thought that that
would be my career when I started this.

272
00:15:46,311 --> 00:15:49,820
But like, she's like, you're putting
your time into this. This is what you're,

273
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:52,760
you're trying to make,
go forward in your life.

274
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:57,740
That's not gonna go anywhere.
I'm just going to say it. Um,

275
00:15:57,770 --> 00:16:00,980
but,
but as soon as I,

276
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:05,300
I think that it's worth saying that I
didn't just sort of drop everything and do

277
00:16:05,301 --> 00:16:09,290
youtube. Like I was still
working different jobs here
and there. I was still, um,

278
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:14,180
I was still working at Ge doing software
engineering for a year and a half.

279
00:16:14,181 --> 00:16:16,160
I still worked at Harvard doing research.

280
00:16:16,161 --> 00:16:20,690
I worked at UC SD doing outreach there
and then worked at a science museum.

281
00:16:20,691 --> 00:16:24,320
So I was never like,
like on the streets.

282
00:16:24,321 --> 00:16:28,780
I wasn't like homeless
editing videos, but I, um,

283
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:32,300
I think I had this project though is on
the side and it was like I'm going to

284
00:16:32,301 --> 00:16:36,380
put as much effort as I can on the side
while being a responsible human being

285
00:16:36,381 --> 00:16:41,381
and having a job that's at least 10
generally related to what I want to do.

286
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:42,493
Cool.

287
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:46,500
So youtube creators are fascinating
because the learning process is documented

288
00:16:46,501 --> 00:16:50,010
online. In preparing for this interview,
I've watched a lot of your videos.

289
00:16:50,011 --> 00:16:53,360
Of course, they're all terrific,
including your earliest, which,

290
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,350
which you said over lunch
you don't watch very often.

291
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:58,860
So when I interviewed Kari Byron, she
mentioned that she didn't have any, uh,

292
00:16:58,890 --> 00:17:02,940
theater training and learned on the job.
Was Theater ever in your background?

293
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:06,150
What was your learning process to
figure out how to be on camera,

294
00:17:06,151 --> 00:17:08,190
which is not necessarily a natural thing.

295
00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:10,370
Yeah,
I did actually did some theater.

296
00:17:10,371 --> 00:17:14,210
I did musical theater up
until like middle school ish.

297
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:17,210
And then after that I did,
I did some performing,

298
00:17:17,211 --> 00:17:20,660
but it was mostly like I
sang in an acapella group
and inquires and I played the

299
00:17:20,661 --> 00:17:24,950
piano and stuff. Um, so I, I
had some performance experience,

300
00:17:24,951 --> 00:17:25,910
but it was mostly singing.

301
00:17:25,911 --> 00:17:30,260
It wasn't necessarily like I didn't have
a lot of speaking experience and that's

302
00:17:30,261 --> 00:17:34,370
something that I've done a lot more than
I expected with starting. I was like,

303
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:37,970
Hey, this'll be great. I'll be alone in
my room filming in front of a camera.

304
00:17:37,971 --> 00:17:41,090
And then I started getting invited to
speak to people in person and was like,

305
00:17:41,091 --> 00:17:45,160
wait a minute. Not what I
signed up for. But it's,

306
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:48,470
it's more fun I think, honestly,
being in front of real people,

307
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:50,580
there's more a reaction from the lens.

308
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,350
So at the end of the day
you have to pay your bills.

309
00:17:53,351 --> 00:17:56,660
Like everyone else you talked to about
how during the transition period, uh, you,

310
00:17:56,690 --> 00:18:00,010
you were, had sort of a normal
day job, you know, how did you,

311
00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:04,200
at what point were you able to say youtube
is my career as opposed to youtube is

312
00:18:04,201 --> 00:18:07,420
something I'm pursuing and figuring
out what and what made that possible.

313
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:12,260
So yeah, like you said, my very
first videos are cringe worthy. Well,

314
00:18:12,261 --> 00:18:15,020
he didn't say that. I didn't
say that. I mean I, I'll say it

315
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:19,490
and they're still, they're still up there
on youtube so you can check them out.

316
00:18:19,491 --> 00:18:22,940
But um, but I think that it's
important to see, like I, you know,

317
00:18:22,941 --> 00:18:26,550
I learned so much through the
process of doing this, um,

318
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:31,660
and no one was going to be paying me
or giving me any funding to make those

319
00:18:31,701 --> 00:18:35,480
videos. They kind of started as
like skit videos more than they did.

320
00:18:35,630 --> 00:18:39,410
They were like nerdy skits. It was
like, what to do with a physics degree.

321
00:18:39,411 --> 00:18:43,550
And then I stood on my diploma to have
like that much height increase to stand

322
00:18:43,551 --> 00:18:48,551
up and get something on a top shelf or
I used my diploma to like row about,

323
00:18:49,370 --> 00:18:54,110
which could be useful now with all
the flooding and California. Um,

324
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:57,980
but uh, but yeah, I, I they were more,

325
00:18:58,010 --> 00:19:01,250
they were more skits and it didn't
start out as like a science channel.

326
00:19:01,251 --> 00:19:02,930
It started out as something else.

327
00:19:02,931 --> 00:19:05,870
But once I kind of veered it into
the science channel and I was like,

328
00:19:05,871 --> 00:19:08,780
I've wanted to do science communication.
Um,

329
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:10,880
I entered the flame challenge,

330
00:19:10,881 --> 00:19:13,670
which is the science communication
competition and like video competition.

331
00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:15,230
And I won that,

332
00:19:15,290 --> 00:19:19,570
that got picked up by UCF news cause
I was working there and then I,

333
00:19:19,571 --> 00:19:23,750
UC SD alum was working at PBS,
um,

334
00:19:23,810 --> 00:19:26,330
and he's saw the article,
he was like, Hey,

335
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:29,240
we should get in touch
about you working with PBS.

336
00:19:29,241 --> 00:19:33,800
And so now I'm signed with Pvs. I,
they're my sponsors and they, um,

337
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:36,500
I'm part of their PBS
digital studios networks.

338
00:19:36,501 --> 00:19:40,400
So that was when it became like full time.
I got funding from PBS,

339
00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:43,610
but like it was really like serendipitous.

340
00:19:43,611 --> 00:19:45,560
There was a lot of
lucky steps that happen.

341
00:19:45,561 --> 00:19:49,940
Like if that hadn't seen the article or
how to add an entered the competition,

342
00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:53,390
I wasn't going to enter. I was like,
it's for scientists and I'm not,

343
00:19:53,391 --> 00:19:56,510
I'm not working as a scientist. And my
advisor was like, are you kidding me?

344
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:59,600
Did you ever do scientific research?
And it's like, yes, he's like,

345
00:19:59,601 --> 00:20:03,910
enter that competition. I am so glad
he told me to and made me do that.

346
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:07,670
Cause it ended up, you know,
this like lucky chain of events.

347
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:09,250
So for the,
uh,

348
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:12,700
over half a million subscribers and
many more millions of fans you have.

349
00:20:12,701 --> 00:20:17,260
Describe a typical week as a youtube
creator. If there is a typical week.

350
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,073
Um,

351
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:26,120
well I answer a lot of emails just like
everyone else and it eats away at my

352
00:20:26,431 --> 00:20:30,870
soul. Um, I, I,

353
00:20:30,871 --> 00:20:32,070
I would say that,
you know,

354
00:20:32,071 --> 00:20:37,071
there's a pretty typical schedule that
goes from like doing research to editing,

355
00:20:37,681 --> 00:20:40,800
to animating,
to like putting up a video.

356
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:46,100
But there are some unusual times,
like I still, I have deadlines, um,

357
00:20:46,290 --> 00:20:51,010
with PBS and so I still wait until the
last minute and I'm up until 4:00 AM like

358
00:20:51,011 --> 00:20:55,090
I was in college, uh, finishing that
video that needs to go out the next day.

359
00:20:55,091 --> 00:20:56,290
So I still do that.

360
00:20:56,291 --> 00:20:58,720
I'm still like every once in a
while there's some audio missing.

361
00:20:58,721 --> 00:21:01,570
And so I'm like in my closet
recording the voiceover,

362
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:06,070
which conveniently it has
good soundproofing cause
there's all the clothes

363
00:21:06,071 --> 00:21:08,770
hanging around.
So sometimes I'll just go in there.

364
00:21:08,771 --> 00:21:11,440
So you can imagine this is what you could,
should imagine physics girl.

365
00:21:11,441 --> 00:21:16,180
Like I sit in my closet on the ground
with my recording equipment and I'm like

366
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:17,930
the capacitor.

367
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:23,490
So that's part of what the job is like.

368
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:27,630
So what video are you most proud of?
Even if it wasn't your most viewed,

369
00:21:27,631 --> 00:21:30,090
which is probably your most viewed.
It's still in the vortex videos. Yeah,

370
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:33,300
probably. But what do you most proud of?
Even if it wasn't your most viewed video?

371
00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:37,970
Um, well I'm pretty, I'm pretty proud
of the one that I just put out. Yeah.

372
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:42,240
Cool. I, I think it came at a
time where I was feeling like,

373
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:47,750
like it's starting to get to like a
routine of making videos and this has been

374
00:21:48,521 --> 00:21:50,860
my hobby and now it's my career.

375
00:21:50,861 --> 00:21:55,360
So for it to get kind of routine is like
I was having a little crisis for awhile.

376
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:58,660
I was like this, I can't, I can't have
it be like a career. I can have it.

377
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:02,610
Well it is, I mean I can't have it
be just like to routine and, and,

378
00:22:02,611 --> 00:22:06,490
and get to the point where I'm losing
interest. So this video for me,

379
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:11,080
it was like I'm going to sacrifice a
few sleepless nights to spend more time

380
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:15,340
making this experiment and working
with my, uh, my intern on it.

381
00:22:15,341 --> 00:22:18,160
And so like having that kind of
fun back and forth, I don't know.

382
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:22,210
And so I'm really proud that I made
the effort to take a step back from the

383
00:22:22,211 --> 00:22:26,320
schedule and the routine to do something
that took more effort and took a lot of

384
00:22:26,321 --> 00:22:29,470
failing.
And I'm pretty proud of that process.

385
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:32,360
Well, we'll send a maker element
of it was, was really cool.

386
00:22:32,361 --> 00:22:34,640
So as was a fan of your table more
and more and more. It's awesome.

387
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:36,890
So has it gotten easier,
harder,

388
00:22:36,891 --> 00:22:39,260
and you've kind of touched on this just
a in the last question is you've gone

389
00:22:39,261 --> 00:22:42,620
from tens and followers to
half a million plus plus plus.

390
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:48,630
Yeah, I would say that it's
probably gotten harder. Um, I,

391
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:53,570
I think it's like, uh, like
I feel like the more I,

392
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:57,590
the more I do, the more I want to do and
I want to like, it's like working out,

393
00:22:57,620 --> 00:23:02,260
you know, like as you get stronger the
more you want to lift, I imagine. Yeah.

394
00:23:05,170 --> 00:23:06,780
I also imagine,
I also know,

395
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:10,630
I mean I do go to the gym

396
00:23:10,770 --> 00:23:15,690
darn time, but I'm more of a
runner. Um, but I, yeah, like,

397
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:18,060
like the more I do,
the more I like,

398
00:23:18,061 --> 00:23:21,480
I want to push myself and I want to
make better videos and longer videos.

399
00:23:21,481 --> 00:23:25,800
And so I feel like instead of like,
I have a very experience I can,

400
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:27,360
I can sit back and it's easy.

401
00:23:27,361 --> 00:23:30,660
It's more like I just want my videos to
be better and better and improve more

402
00:23:30,661 --> 00:23:35,190
and more. And I feel more of that
pressure as the audience grows too. Yeah.

403
00:23:35,450 --> 00:23:39,690
Um, so how do you calibrate the level
of detail and complexity for each video,

404
00:23:39,691 --> 00:23:42,300
which cover wildly divergent topics.

405
00:23:42,330 --> 00:23:44,570
And what role does feedback
from your audience play? One,

406
00:23:44,571 --> 00:23:47,270
which I assume you get lots of
feedback across the whole spectrum.

407
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:51,860
Yes. Oh, those commenters.

408
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:58,450
Um, yeah, some of the feedback is,

409
00:23:58,510 --> 00:24:00,160
is really good.
Um,

410
00:24:00,330 --> 00:24:05,330
there's one comment that stands in my
mind and it was pretty trolley but,

411
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:07,900
but like came at the right time.

412
00:24:07,901 --> 00:24:12,250
So I had made some of these videos
and then I made a science video.

413
00:24:12,251 --> 00:24:15,020
Science should video and then I
made some more skit videos and um,

414
00:24:15,130 --> 00:24:19,150
the name of the channel back then was
actually physics woman, but I was like,

415
00:24:19,151 --> 00:24:22,720
I'm too, I'm not mature
enough for that name. So, um,

416
00:24:22,930 --> 00:24:24,280
so someone was like,

417
00:24:24,281 --> 00:24:27,820
you had a good idea what the channel with
like the science theme and making the

418
00:24:27,821 --> 00:24:31,600
science content, you should have stuck
with that. And I was like, hmm, yeah,

419
00:24:31,601 --> 00:24:33,800
maybe they were right. Like I, I,

420
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:38,830
I hadn't thought of making a science
specific channel, but that helps me lead.

421
00:24:38,890 --> 00:24:42,850
That helped lead me to the thought
process. Um, but at the same time,

422
00:24:42,851 --> 00:24:45,850
there are comments that
frustrate the crap out of me.

423
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:51,060
Like I made a video about why mirrors
flip appear to flip things horizontally

424
00:24:52,181 --> 00:24:53,770
and not vertically.
Um,

425
00:24:53,890 --> 00:24:57,820
which is an interesting question and
it's something that Fineman thought about

426
00:24:57,821 --> 00:25:00,820
and wrote that he did like an
interview about it. Um, I asked,

427
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:04,480
I was living with at the time with a
number of physics graduate students,

428
00:25:04,810 --> 00:25:08,710
one of them right there. Um, uh,
and so I asked them, you know,

429
00:25:08,770 --> 00:25:11,190
I asked them this question
and they were like, like,

430
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,540
does it have to do with
your eyes being horizontal?

431
00:25:13,541 --> 00:25:17,350
Or like they were thinking about
the, um, the, you know, the diag,

432
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:19,660
the optics diagrams.
Um,

433
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:24,790
and then I made this video and it's
actually kind of a complicated answer.

434
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:28,780
Um, and most of the comments
were like, are you kidding?

435
00:25:28,781 --> 00:25:30,790
This is a video about how mirrors work.

436
00:25:30,791 --> 00:25:33,670
This is something you learned
in first grade. And I was,

437
00:25:33,730 --> 00:25:37,120
I was blown away that people were
saying condescending stuff like that.

438
00:25:37,121 --> 00:25:38,440
But also they were wrong.

439
00:25:38,441 --> 00:25:43,360
Like it's a hard question
and it's something that I
bet most of them wouldn't be

440
00:25:43,361 --> 00:25:46,090
able to answer when put on the spot.
So,

441
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:49,450
so like some of the feedback you
have to take with a grain of salt,

442
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:53,260
uh, your video explaining why perpetual
motion machines are impossible.

443
00:25:53,261 --> 00:25:55,160
What was terrific as a terrific video.

444
00:25:55,161 --> 00:25:59,510
What are the most common physics smiths
you keep debunking despite all the

445
00:25:59,511 --> 00:26:00,344
videos you put out?

446
00:26:01,550 --> 00:26:06,470
Well, yeah, there's the perpetual that
physics is not cool. That's a good answer.

447
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,490
That's a myth.
Um,

448
00:26:09,170 --> 00:26:13,550
I don't really do a lot of debunking
on my channel. I would say like I did,

449
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:14,391
I definitely did that one,

450
00:26:14,391 --> 00:26:17,510
but I think that was maybe one of the
only videos where I did debunking.

451
00:26:17,570 --> 00:26:22,520
And I think, I think partially
that's, um, that's on purpose that,

452
00:26:22,610 --> 00:26:27,020
that like, I think questions are
important to encourage and I think that,

453
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:31,070
um,
every time I see a good question,

454
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:33,980
I make an effort to point out.
That's a really good question.

455
00:26:34,090 --> 00:26:36,260
If it's not as good of a question,
I'll still be like,

456
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:40,490
thank you for asking because it's never
going to be like a negative experience

457
00:26:40,491 --> 00:26:42,410
when someone has asked a question.
So,

458
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:45,000
so misconceptions are
interesting to address,

459
00:26:45,001 --> 00:26:49,410
but I think it's more fascinating and
more interesting to figure out why those

460
00:26:49,411 --> 00:26:52,760
misconceptions are common and why
they persist. Oh, cool. Yeah. Yeah.

461
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:56,870
Oh, so you mentioned any youtube posts.
I think it was a Q and a poster that, uh,

462
00:26:56,890 --> 00:26:59,640
it can be a lonely job
being a youtuber times. Um,

463
00:26:59,730 --> 00:27:03,930
there's a strong youtube community of
creators that you tap into or is it

464
00:27:03,931 --> 00:27:05,880
collaborative, competitive? Uh,

465
00:27:05,910 --> 00:27:08,040
what's it like being a youtuber
and that loneliness factor?

466
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:13,100
Yeah, I would say the day to day gets
a little bit, um, a little bit lonely,

467
00:27:13,101 --> 00:27:17,300
although less so lately because I've
started working with more people. Um, I,

468
00:27:17,330 --> 00:27:20,780
I have a team, but, um, but yeah,

469
00:27:20,781 --> 00:27:24,860
there's a big youtube community,
uh, in science as well. Um,

470
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:27,800
we're all spread out, which makes
it a little bit difficult. Like,

471
00:27:27,801 --> 00:27:31,470
there's some people in Texas, I'm
in New York and some in La, um,

472
00:27:31,490 --> 00:27:34,610
some up here in San Francisco, but, um,

473
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:37,970
never have I felt competition with them.

474
00:27:37,971 --> 00:27:42,260
Like I've only ever felt support from
bigger channels or kind of excitement

475
00:27:42,261 --> 00:27:44,240
towards smaller channels and,
and you know,

476
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:46,790
we always call each other and
ask advice and we're like,

477
00:27:46,791 --> 00:27:48,370
what do you think about this
title? And we're like, no,

478
00:27:48,371 --> 00:27:51,740
that's pretty boring or that, that
thumbnail is bad. Don't do that. Um,

479
00:27:51,741 --> 00:27:56,210
so I think that we've, um, I think
we've been much more collaborative than,

480
00:27:56,270 --> 00:27:59,670
than competitive and we all
meet up foot at Vidcon, um,

481
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:03,650
for the last couple of years at least
I've gone and we like play board games and

482
00:28:03,651 --> 00:28:05,390
you know,
it's as nerdy as you would imagine.

483
00:28:06,770 --> 00:28:09,510
So, uh, this is probably
affects everyone you tuber. Um,

484
00:28:09,650 --> 00:28:12,380
how do you know where to draw the line
between your personal private life and

485
00:28:12,381 --> 00:28:14,240
the need to be engaged with your fans?

486
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:16,800
Yeah. Um, I,

487
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,930
I don't have a lot of
trouble sharing things.

488
00:28:19,931 --> 00:28:24,280
Like I don't have a ton of skeletons
in my closet, so like I'm a nerd.

489
00:28:24,281 --> 00:28:27,400
It's out there and like I'm wearing a
pie scarf, you know, everyone knows.

490
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:33,880
Um, but, but I think, you know more,

491
00:28:33,881 --> 00:28:35,680
I'm worried about the people in my life.

492
00:28:35,681 --> 00:28:39,280
So like now that I have on the
other social media channels,

493
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:42,940
like Twitter and Instagram and Facebook,
I'll get more personal,

494
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:46,600
but I'll be more careful
about like posting a picture
of my sister or posting a

495
00:28:46,601 --> 00:28:49,480
picture of my friends because I'm like,
you know,

496
00:28:49,630 --> 00:28:52,970
thousands of people may see this and
you should know that before I posted,

497
00:28:53,010 --> 00:28:57,640
is it okay? And usually they're
like, yeah, cool. So, um, so that's,

498
00:28:57,700 --> 00:29:01,240
that's more of what I worry about.
But as a science host,

499
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:05,770
people aren't so much into like my day
to day life that it's more about like

500
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:09,430
we're sharing the science and like we're
exploring the science together and yes,

501
00:29:09,431 --> 00:29:14,320
I am a person who does science and
there's some, you know, um, side effects.

502
00:29:14,321 --> 00:29:18,730
Like I'm, I, I'm a woman in
a male dominated field of,

503
00:29:19,050 --> 00:29:23,020
of physics and of science communication.
So like I get,

504
00:29:23,170 --> 00:29:27,550
I get people reaching out and being like,
my daughter loves your channel and,

505
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:32,490
and thank you for being that role
model, um, for, for my daughter. So,

506
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:37,330
so like in that way, like having the
personal aspect of me as a person,

507
00:29:37,331 --> 00:29:40,410
being a scientist come out
is a good thing, but I'm,

508
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:44,410
people want to know what I do everyday.
It's pretty boring. So in my closet,

509
00:29:46,170 --> 00:29:49,290
pivoting off the, you know, the,
the mom or dad reached docs,

510
00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:50,850
her daughters has been impacted.

511
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:56,120
So how do you view your role in helping
breakthrough this persistent myth about

512
00:29:58,411 --> 00:29:59,244
women and stem?

513
00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:03,760
I think, I think that
I'm making, you know,

514
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:07,250
a small contribution. Um, I,

515
00:30:07,730 --> 00:30:10,920
I was just at a science
teacher conference, um, in,

516
00:30:10,930 --> 00:30:14,270
in Virginia and then the teacher
on the teachers there was like,

517
00:30:14,271 --> 00:30:17,270
I show your videos in my f my fifth
grade class. Then they love the videos.

518
00:30:17,271 --> 00:30:18,230
And I was like,
interesting.

519
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:21,710
Like I'm curious how they react and I
just asked the question because I wanted

520
00:30:21,711 --> 00:30:24,980
to know like how fifth graders at that
age would react to physics videos.

521
00:30:24,981 --> 00:30:29,480
But she told me a different story,
which was that when I first watched it,

522
00:30:29,481 --> 00:30:31,220
it was a video with, um, my,

523
00:30:31,250 --> 00:30:35,360
my boyfriend Kyle holding
the stack of three balls. Um,

524
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:36,590
and then you dropped those.

525
00:30:36,770 --> 00:30:40,190
And then I explain how that works
and how it's like a supernova.

526
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:44,180
So their reaction was cool,
why is she talking?

527
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:48,740
They thought that he should be the
host and I should be like the assistant

528
00:30:48,770 --> 00:30:51,460
because that's what they typically see,
um,

529
00:30:51,470 --> 00:30:54,080
is like there's a male host doing science.
And,

530
00:30:54,350 --> 00:30:58,820
and she was really taken aback by
that response with her class. Um,

531
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:01,610
so was I, but, um, but,

532
00:31:01,850 --> 00:31:04,850
but I think that it was good and it
started a big conversation with them.

533
00:31:04,851 --> 00:31:08,000
Like they realize, oh, this
is her show, this is her idea.

534
00:31:08,001 --> 00:31:09,530
She has the science background.

535
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:13,400
And it was a good opportunity for them
to have a conversation about this and

536
00:31:13,430 --> 00:31:17,750
kind of break the idea of the
stereotypes of what girls can do. So,

537
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:22,400
um, I'm, I'm happy that those
conversations are happening in classrooms.

538
00:31:22,570 --> 00:31:25,450
So one more question from
me. They're going to hand it
off to the Dory in the, uh,

539
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:26,380
the audience here.

540
00:31:26,410 --> 00:31:30,790
So I interviewed Emily Cowans Reli
recently who is going to be unbilled eyes,

541
00:31:30,791 --> 00:31:33,940
new Netflix series. You also had
a chance to partner with Bill Nye.

542
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,100
Is He as cool and energetic as he appears?

543
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:40,140
He's quirky,
very quirky.

544
00:31:42,090 --> 00:31:46,200
Um, yeah, I did. I filmed a video
with him and actually I met him. Man,

545
00:31:46,201 --> 00:31:50,310
my life has taken a turn. I met him
at the White House. I got, I was,

546
00:31:51,210 --> 00:31:54,650
I dunno how I ended up there. I probably
won't end up there anytime soon, but

547
00:31:57,930 --> 00:32:01,830
it was good while it lasted. Um, so I,

548
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:06,750
I was at the White House and Bill Nye was
there. Um, this wasn't a dream, I swear.

549
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:12,480
I mean they like it was, but
it was true. Um, so, so there,

550
00:32:12,481 --> 00:32:16,620
when I met him, I, he was like,
because texting and whatever,

551
00:32:16,621 --> 00:32:18,420
and I came up and I was like, Hey, bill.

552
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:21,600
And I was holding my phone and he thought
that I would want it to take a selfie.

553
00:32:21,601 --> 00:32:25,110
So he's really a lot of selfies. And so
he grabbed my phone at 10. I was like, no,

554
00:32:25,111 --> 00:32:29,610
I just want to like talk to you. I
love you. So, so that interaction was,

555
00:32:29,611 --> 00:32:31,890
was he loves selfies.
So that's my first impression.

556
00:32:33,130 --> 00:32:36,060
The second impression when
we, when we worked together
on a video, he's just like,

557
00:32:36,061 --> 00:32:40,280
he's very excited about science and he'll
love to share like things he has like

558
00:32:40,281 --> 00:32:43,400
toys, he has like my earrings,
you know, he's, he's like that.

559
00:32:43,401 --> 00:32:46,460
He's got that real kind
of excitement for science.

560
00:32:46,461 --> 00:32:51,200
And then the third time I got to watch
Emily's taping of villain I shows that

561
00:32:51,201 --> 00:32:54,770
was really exciting and he
remembered me and I remembered him.

562
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:59,750
So it was mutually good. Uh,
yeah, it felt nice. Great. Cool.

563
00:32:59,970 --> 00:33:04,240
Hi, very nice to meet you.
My, uh, daughter and I are
both subscribers and, uh, yes,

564
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:07,170
exactly. What you mentioned
about two questions ago.

565
00:33:07,171 --> 00:33:09,930
You're inspiring a young women
to get interested in science.

566
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:12,770
Does she have her own account
or are you skewing the results?

567
00:33:13,050 --> 00:33:16,640
Uh, no, she didn't. She has her own
account. She, she's uh, she's 14.

568
00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:22,310
One thing I've noticed though is I
think when she was like 11, 12, 13,

569
00:33:22,490 --> 00:33:25,640
she was much more excited. Now she's 14,
she's getting less excited about physics.

570
00:33:26,150 --> 00:33:30,410
What kept you interested and how can
I inspire her to stay interested?

571
00:33:30,590 --> 00:33:31,760
What are you thoughts on that?

572
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:35,800
Yeah. Ah, that's such a hard question
because cause like, you know,

573
00:33:35,801 --> 00:33:39,570
you can do as much as you want,
but there's so many societal pressures on,

574
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:43,930
on women, um, to not continue
on with the sciences.

575
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:48,940
Um, I personally had throughout
high school I have these
teachers that were just

576
00:33:48,941 --> 00:33:52,910
like, you are awesome at math,
you're really good at science. And I,

577
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,760
I remember so vividly when my,

578
00:33:54,790 --> 00:33:58,780
my astronomy teacher told me that girls
who do physics are cool. And I was like,

579
00:33:59,230 --> 00:34:03,740
I want to be cool because at that point
I had never experienced being cool. Um,

580
00:34:04,390 --> 00:34:08,860
so, so like it was the
encouragement and it was, um,

581
00:34:10,050 --> 00:34:14,030
it was from my teachers. It was
from, from some of my peers, um,

582
00:34:14,140 --> 00:34:17,380
to continue asking questions
and to continue exploring.

583
00:34:17,381 --> 00:34:21,040
And I think like the
investigation of, of, um,

584
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:24,310
of questions about the world
in addition to the, um,

585
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:29,170
the support and encouragement of teachers
was probably what carried me through

586
00:34:29,171 --> 00:34:30,820
to actually doing a physics degree.

587
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:37,790
If scientists march in Washington,
will you be there

588
00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:45,330
man, that's so mean. Like I try so hard
not to get political on social media.

589
00:34:46,170 --> 00:34:50,830
Um, it's, uh, I mean it probably
depends on my schedule, but,

590
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:56,400
um, probably, yeah, I mean, I, I'm, I,

591
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:01,870
I'm a huge supporter of science and the
freedom of scientists to do the science,

592
00:35:01,890 --> 00:35:06,720
you know, the science that is important
to them, um, and nothing politicized. And,

593
00:35:07,290 --> 00:35:11,120
um, and I, you know, I, I,

594
00:35:11,550 --> 00:35:14,700
I don't want to say believe in climate
change because it's just a fact.

595
00:35:14,701 --> 00:35:19,140
Like it's just like the science
is there. So, um, so like I,

596
00:35:19,290 --> 00:35:23,250
climate change is a hugely important
issue to me and it's something that's,

597
00:35:23,310 --> 00:35:27,840
that's currently not looking
good for being addressed by,

598
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:32,740
uh, by, you know, politicians
taking power. So, sorry, smarts.

599
00:35:32,770 --> 00:35:35,630
If you brought your own science
experiment, that can be really,

600
00:35:37,110 --> 00:35:40,500
that's got to happen. Forget
about any politics. Just
bring it, you know, to enter,

601
00:35:40,501 --> 00:35:43,180
you have to have a science experiment
and it has to be cool. Yeah,

602
00:35:43,390 --> 00:35:45,600
that would be a lot of dry ice.
I'll bring my,

603
00:35:45,650 --> 00:35:49,080
my like my atmospheric co
two detector. Yeah, exactly.

604
00:35:49,081 --> 00:35:51,360
What would you bring them here and doing
the science march will be your best

605
00:35:51,361 --> 00:35:53,550
experiment. That would be,
that would work for walking.

606
00:35:53,551 --> 00:35:56,970
Like this is an interesting challenge.
I actually have this experiment.

607
00:35:56,971 --> 00:36:01,380
I almost brought it today. I should
have brought it. Ah Man. Um, it's a,

608
00:36:01,381 --> 00:36:05,550
it's a PVC pipe with a bunch of wires
wrapped around it and then some LEDs

609
00:36:05,551 --> 00:36:07,440
connected to the wires in a circle.

610
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:11,850
So it makes us a loop and then you just
drop a magnet through the PVC pipe and

611
00:36:11,851 --> 00:36:15,800
all the LEDs light up. There you go.
So that's like the big marching Bhutan,

612
00:36:18,650 --> 00:36:22,200
but it's like very nerdy. So
that'd be perfect. All right.

613
00:36:22,201 --> 00:36:24,080
So we can make it very positive
science marcher experiments.

614
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:25,350
Another audience question.

615
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:30,520
Do you have a list of things you want to
try out? And that list is girls, girls,

616
00:36:30,521 --> 00:36:32,920
girls, sort of Joe's. And do
you like stop and say, okay,

617
00:36:32,921 --> 00:36:35,560
which video am I going to work
on this week or this month?

618
00:36:35,590 --> 00:36:37,780
Or what's the procedure there?

619
00:36:37,810 --> 00:36:41,160
And also do you compare
lists with Veritas,

620
00:36:41,161 --> 00:36:44,860
yum and smarter every day and
say, oh, you also want to do this,

621
00:36:44,870 --> 00:36:47,380
this and these sort of crosspollinate or,

622
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:50,560
yeah, yeah. That actually
happened recently because, um,

623
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:55,490
I did a video on a anti
bubbles which are like, oh,

624
00:36:55,491 --> 00:36:58,640
you guys are all nodding.
Um,

625
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:03,880
which are bubbles, sort of.
They're, they're like, um,

626
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:07,670
instead of a shell of liquid
with air inside an air outside,

627
00:37:07,671 --> 00:37:11,570
they're a shell of water with,
with, or a shell of air, sorry,

628
00:37:11,810 --> 00:37:14,930
with water inside and water outside.
So they're anti bubbles.

629
00:37:14,931 --> 00:37:17,030
It's a more fancy name
than the actual thing is.

630
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:20,480
But I was talking with a destined from
smarter everyday and he was like, oh,

631
00:37:20,481 --> 00:37:22,460
I wanted to do a video
about something similar.

632
00:37:22,461 --> 00:37:26,750
So I put my video off as
long as I could. Uh, but,

633
00:37:26,930 --> 00:37:30,890
but I shouted out to his upcoming
video and he shouted out to mine.

634
00:37:30,891 --> 00:37:33,890
And Derek have from very task name
happened to do one at the same time.

635
00:37:33,891 --> 00:37:37,760
So Destin shout out to his video like
we all kind of keep track of what each

636
00:37:37,761 --> 00:37:39,260
other is working on.
Um,

637
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:43,880
I really wanted to do a video
about how big a building,

638
00:37:43,910 --> 00:37:48,800
how tall a building would be for the top
of it to be moving the speed of light

639
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:51,890
if relativity wasn't a thing.
Um,

640
00:37:52,370 --> 00:37:55,010
and I was kind of looking through
right before I was about to post it.

641
00:37:55,011 --> 00:37:58,490
I realize that vsauce had done a video
of something similar he talked about.

642
00:37:58,491 --> 00:38:02,300
So it was like my goal, I'm putting out
a video similar to yours. He's like,

643
00:38:02,330 --> 00:38:05,720
that's fine. Just do it. Like we're all,
I think we're all very supportive of,

644
00:38:05,721 --> 00:38:09,750
of overlapping topics and we're all
going to address things differently. Um,

645
00:38:09,770 --> 00:38:10,700
but for your first question,

646
00:38:10,730 --> 00:38:14,180
I do have a long running list and I've
been sticking more and more things on it

647
00:38:14,181 --> 00:38:18,740
that are like go in the zero g plane
or go to Antarctica or you know,

648
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:22,760
so I'm not going to be able to do a
lot of those things, but I'm trying,

649
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:24,800
trying to make it happen.

650
00:38:25,010 --> 00:38:25,970
Another story question,

651
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:30,840
what kind of reaction does you channel
get from people outside of the UAE? USA?

652
00:38:31,770 --> 00:38:35,300
I have a, a large audience
in India actually. Um,

653
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:40,210
more so on my Facebook page then on my
youtube channel, which is interesting.

654
00:38:40,570 --> 00:38:44,920
Um, I guess the same reaction.
I think sometimes they're like,

655
00:38:44,921 --> 00:38:49,180
can you put some titles? Can you, uh, um,

656
00:38:50,050 --> 00:38:54,340
yeah, I mean I would say the reaction
isn't much different for the international

657
00:38:54,341 --> 00:38:57,970
community. Like people ask
the same kinds of questions,

658
00:38:57,971 --> 00:39:00,970
they ask the same kind of followup
questions in the comments.

659
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:06,420
They make the same kind of snarky comments
about my sticky out ears or whatever

660
00:39:07,121 --> 00:39:08,980
it is rude.

661
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:12,650
Uh, since you're at Google, might
as well ask this question. Uh,

662
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:14,770
what's one feature you
wish was added to youtube?

663
00:39:15,830 --> 00:39:19,400
Oh, interesting. Well,

664
00:39:19,490 --> 00:39:21,710
the algorithm recently changed.

665
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:29,440
So that led to part of my existential
crisis because I'm on this,

666
00:39:31,310 --> 00:39:34,900
this is man, this is getting
personal, but like I, I'm,

667
00:39:34,901 --> 00:39:39,320
I'm on this terrible platform where
like my quantitative success is,

668
00:39:39,650 --> 00:39:44,060
um, is measured by like my views and
my subscribers and then those plummeted

669
00:39:44,061 --> 00:39:47,900
recently with the
algorithm change. So, um,

670
00:39:48,530 --> 00:39:52,670
I wish they would roll it back, but,
but no, I'm just kidding. I really,

671
00:39:52,671 --> 00:39:56,180
I honestly think that that kind of was
like a wake wakeup call for me and the

672
00:39:56,181 --> 00:39:59,540
one of the reasons why I did the most
recent video because I was like starting

673
00:39:59,541 --> 00:40:02,780
to get into this routine and I was like,
I need something that's like for me.

674
00:40:02,781 --> 00:40:06,830
And I'm really enjoying this
for the purposes of doing
it. And so I'm glad that,

675
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:11,020
that I've, it's kind of made me
move back toward that, you know,

676
00:40:11,510 --> 00:40:16,370
that approach to making videos.
Um, other than that, uh,

677
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:22,040
I, I don't know. I, I, I'm pretty
happy with everything that's on there.

678
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:27,020
There's not much I, I do on other
areas that I don't, that I, you know,

679
00:40:27,021 --> 00:40:28,970
would it be able to do on Youtube?
Like on,

680
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:32,840
I used Dropbox and I use Google for other
things and I use some of these other

681
00:40:32,841 --> 00:40:37,250
services, but I don't think I would want
youtube to store my documents. I Dunno.

682
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:41,460
I love the collaboration. Yet there
was a song about Newton and Einstein.

683
00:40:42,110 --> 00:40:43,740
I just hadn't realized
you had seen background.

684
00:40:43,741 --> 00:40:45,360
Do you have plans to do
any more physics songs?

685
00:40:45,510 --> 00:40:49,310
Oh yes. Oh my gosh. So I don't know if,

686
00:40:49,330 --> 00:40:51,040
I don't know if this would actually like,

687
00:40:51,041 --> 00:40:54,220
this would probably be one of those
cringey videos that I made earlier on,

688
00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:56,950
but I was, so, it was, uh,

689
00:40:57,220 --> 00:41:00,310
it was in the car driving
with my boyfriend the other
day and he wasn't paying

690
00:41:00,311 --> 00:41:04,540
attention to me. So I started singing,
I started singing, but like, you know,

691
00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:07,980
bringing jobs on roses and I was
started, I was like, what if you put,

692
00:41:07,990 --> 00:41:10,180
could put physics lyrics to that.
So I was like,

693
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:13,720
I was like classical physics
and quantum mechanics.

694
00:41:14,230 --> 00:41:16,360
These are a few of my favorite things.
So,

695
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:21,370
so it was like maybe I could make a song
out of that and make it go somewhere

696
00:41:21,371 --> 00:41:25,390
and it'd be really, really
goofy. But maybe, I dunno,
maybe I might do some more.

697
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:28,970
Uh, what were some memorable failures
when you were starting your cheque?

698
00:41:29,950 --> 00:41:31,240
Clearly unprompted questions.

699
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:37,700
Memorable failures. Oh, well, I have,

700
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:41,780
um, I have, I'm put some
errors in my videos.

701
00:41:41,781 --> 00:41:45,380
Like I've had to literally take the
whole video down and I've, you know,

702
00:41:45,390 --> 00:41:47,660
I stupid some,
some of that stupid stuff.

703
00:41:47,661 --> 00:41:50,810
Some of it was like I actually
had misconceptions. Um,

704
00:41:50,811 --> 00:41:54,140
so those were really good learning
moments for me. But also like,

705
00:41:54,141 --> 00:41:56,990
sometimes it's just like I put an
arrow the wrong way and I'm like, ah,

706
00:41:57,230 --> 00:41:59,300
that's so frustrating.
Um,

707
00:41:59,330 --> 00:42:03,290
but fortunately the whole physics brigade
is there to tell me when I'm wrong.

708
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:09,290
Uh, another memorable
error? Uh, probably not. Uh,

709
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:13,680
remember with fairly when
I was working at UC SD, um,

710
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:17,780
I got this $9,000 grant for us to do some
outreach projects and they gave me the

711
00:42:17,781 --> 00:42:22,430
tech and they presented it in this big
celebration. And then I lost the check.

712
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:27,350
Oh, I lost him. $9,000 check. That was
meant for you. CSD outreach for kids.

713
00:42:27,351 --> 00:42:31,850
And I felt horrible and really
irresponsible. And like everyone else,

714
00:42:31,851 --> 00:42:35,450
I got these grants, they were
like, you know, older. They,
they were, I don't know,

715
00:42:35,451 --> 00:42:39,380
probably in their forties or 50s and
I'm like this 20th something that's like

716
00:42:39,590 --> 00:42:41,050
give me the tech,
I'm going to do outreach,

717
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:43,550
I'm going to leave this whole
project of like science camps.

718
00:42:43,580 --> 00:42:46,040
And then I lost it and it was like,
this does not look good,

719
00:42:47,150 --> 00:42:50,360
but they just issued another check
and then I found it. Oh terrible.

720
00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:53,110
In terms of platforms,

721
00:42:53,190 --> 00:42:56,110
so you sort of stumbled into
youtube cause it was easy to do.

722
00:42:56,111 --> 00:42:57,880
You could sit in your closet,
make your video and whatnot,

723
00:42:58,710 --> 00:43:00,220
but did you sort of look forward,

724
00:43:00,221 --> 00:43:03,760
there are lots of different channels
to make content on. There's Amazon,

725
00:43:03,761 --> 00:43:06,460
there's Netflix, you know, maybe
apple, you know, who knows.

726
00:43:06,940 --> 00:43:10,060
What are your thinking is on that front.
Do you think you'll stick with youtube?

727
00:43:10,061 --> 00:43:12,790
What are the challenges, opportunities?
How does that all fit in?

728
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:15,940
Yeah, that's a really good question. Um,

729
00:43:16,090 --> 00:43:21,090
I think that Facebook is,

730
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:25,860
uh, you know, they're, they're
pushing really hard with
video right now and there,

731
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:26,380
um,

732
00:43:26,380 --> 00:43:30,400
some of my videos do really
well on Facebook when they
don't do well on Youtube.

733
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:33,700
Um, like the exact same video,
we'll just get many more views.

734
00:43:33,701 --> 00:43:36,090
And now that might be view inflation.
I don't know.

735
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:39,490
It's hard to tell at this point. Um,
but then other ones where, you know,

736
00:43:39,491 --> 00:43:44,380
cut down into a certain way that's
more Facebooky and less educational,

737
00:43:44,381 --> 00:43:46,770
which to me is kind of like, uh, um,

738
00:43:47,260 --> 00:43:50,680
but that works well on Facebook and so
that helps bring more of the audience

739
00:43:50,681 --> 00:43:51,640
back over to Youtube,

740
00:43:51,641 --> 00:43:55,690
which I think we'll probably
always be my first love,

741
00:43:55,750 --> 00:43:59,770
but I would love to do more, you
know, more shows that are bigger.

742
00:43:59,771 --> 00:44:02,900
I've got some ideas for, for
like bigger projects, um,

743
00:44:02,980 --> 00:44:06,420
that would maybe work better on a
different platform. I don't know.

744
00:44:08,090 --> 00:44:11,590
No, I don't do any PBS TV.
No. I am PBS digital studios,

745
00:44:11,591 --> 00:44:14,600
so they only have youtube
channels and then, uh,

746
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:18,610
they're kind of separate entities. Well,
I guess they're underneath PBS umbrella,

747
00:44:18,611 --> 00:44:23,310
but they're separate from the PBS
broadcast network shows. Cool.

748
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:28,340
Well, I want to thank you for
taking time out of your busy, busy,

749
00:44:28,341 --> 00:44:29,091
busy schedule,

750
00:44:29,091 --> 00:44:31,860
which I know is very busy from all the
work into create in the awesome stuff.
