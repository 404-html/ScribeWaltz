1
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:08,610
Thanks for coming out of
your, uh, lunch break today.

2
00:00:08,611 --> 00:00:12,570
I appreciate everyone being here today.
I want to talk about,

3
00:00:12,571 --> 00:00:14,550
I want to give you a brief
introduction to some things,

4
00:00:14,551 --> 00:00:17,010
some initiatives we're doing
at the Monterey Bay aquarium,

5
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:20,880
kind of our approach to
problem solving and um,

6
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:24,540
and how we're trying to inspire
conservation of the ocean. Um,

7
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:27,780
as thanks for the introduction,
Kyle, as Kyle mentioned,

8
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:32,340
I oversee our research and science groups
and so I'm going to talk about some of

9
00:00:32,341 --> 00:00:35,640
the things that we've been doing
for the past few years. Uh,

10
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:38,430
one of the really important things
to know about the aquarium is,

11
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:42,060
and even I was surprised about this
is we haven't been around that long.

12
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:45,240
We haven't even been around 40 years that,

13
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:49,230
but our roots go actually back pretty
deep and our roots are kind of based in

14
00:00:49,231 --> 00:00:52,890
two institutions and one of
them is a Stanford University.

15
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:57,570
This is the Hopkins Marine Station that
started in 1890 to 125 years ago in

16
00:00:57,571 --> 00:01:01,200
Pacific Grove, California.
They moved their initial lab,

17
00:01:01,201 --> 00:01:02,220
which is what you see right here.

18
00:01:02,221 --> 00:01:05,880
But what I love about this photo is that
this is what a marine biologist looks

19
00:01:05,881 --> 00:01:08,740
like in 1892. Uh, it
looks rather Victoria,

20
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:12,180
but you still see the kind
of the shenanigans of the
people hanging out on the

21
00:01:12,181 --> 00:01:15,180
roofs. Everyone wants to
be a marine biologist. Um,

22
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:17,400
but not everyone knows what
a marine bio just looks like.

23
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:21,930
This is what a marine biologist
looks like. Um, we're also,
uh, so that spirit of,

24
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:26,100
of, uh, investigation and research
is very alive in what we do.

25
00:01:26,101 --> 00:01:29,490
The other institution is one much
closer to where we are right now.

26
00:01:29,491 --> 00:01:31,890
And that's Hewlett Packard. Um, uh,

27
00:01:31,891 --> 00:01:36,620
HP founded in a garage in Palo
Alto, arguably one of the, uh,

28
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:40,710
by David Packard and Bill Hewlett,
David Packard's daughters. Uh,

29
00:01:40,711 --> 00:01:42,420
we're the ones that founded the aquarium.

30
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:47,400
And so the spirit of innovation from
Silicon Valley and the investigation from

31
00:01:47,401 --> 00:01:50,160
Stanford is really where our
roots are as an institution.

32
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:53,430
We've been science-based
from day one and a,

33
00:01:53,431 --> 00:01:57,780
and we owe a lot to these
two institutions. David
Packard is sometimes, uh,

34
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,320
you know, he's widely viewed as
a, as a titan of silicon valley.

35
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:04,940
His supervisor at Stanford, uh, Terman is,

36
00:02:04,941 --> 00:02:07,200
is widely referred to as the
father of Silicon Valley.

37
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:12,370
And Terman got his phd at Mit
with Vannevar Bush, if you,

38
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,660
that name sounds familiar. He wrote
science, the endless frontier.

39
00:02:15,661 --> 00:02:20,520
He was the first science advisor to a
US president to FDR. And so our roots,

40
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:25,230
if you academics love to trace their roots
back to where it started and Vannevar

41
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:29,070
Bush at MIT is, you could argue is
that's maybe where the aquarium started.

42
00:02:29,071 --> 00:02:31,740
So this is the aquarium.
This is a view off our back deck.

43
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:36,510
I would say that our secret
sauce is that we're about place.

44
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:40,350
We're about the Monterey
Bay. Um, and as you can see,

45
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:43,830
maybe this wasn't taken
today cause it's raining. Um,

46
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:45,630
but it's a glorious place.

47
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:50,660
There's a lot of amazing creatures and
ecosystems just in the Monterey Bay. Um,

48
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:54,570
and it's an interesting story about the
history of conservation in Monterrey.

49
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,700
It wasn't always the way it is today.
Um,

50
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:02,740
it's a story of fisheries collapse of
immigrants coming in and bringing new

51
00:03:02,741 --> 00:03:06,580
technologies of the sociology of
that always not being perfect,

52
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,260
but working things out.

53
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:12,850
It's a story of marine protected areas
and the ecosystems actually returning and

54
00:03:12,851 --> 00:03:17,740
the fisheries coming back.
And so it's not always been an easy story,

55
00:03:17,741 --> 00:03:20,680
but the story of this place I
think is very important, uh,

56
00:03:20,681 --> 00:03:25,500
for marine conservation and
the story of the ocean. So, um,

57
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:27,450
that's where we are.
Um,

58
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:32,290
one of the things that we're working on
in the science team is to solve problems.

59
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:37,060
And even though we have roots in
academia and in Silicon Valley,

60
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:41,620
um, we are, you know, we have,
we're a modest operation. We,

61
00:03:41,621 --> 00:03:44,980
there's only so much that we can do.
And so we want to solve a problem.

62
00:03:44,981 --> 00:03:47,680
Of course we're going to bring
science to bear on that problem.

63
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:49,960
That's what our research
group help support.

64
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:53,920
But we also bring policy and we also
do quite a bit of communication.

65
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:57,680
And so our theory of change
is not necessarily, um,

66
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,740
focusing on one of those,

67
00:03:59,741 --> 00:04:02,230
but doing all of those and trying
to do all of them really well.

68
00:04:02,231 --> 00:04:06,160
We have around 2 million people that come
into our physical building every year.

69
00:04:06,161 --> 00:04:10,060
And we have, you know, um, um,

70
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:13,510
too many people and we probably have
about 50 times those engagements online.

71
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:17,800
So we have an incredible ability to
reach people and educate them about the

72
00:04:17,801 --> 00:04:18,131
ocean.

73
00:04:18,131 --> 00:04:22,540
A great example of this combination of
science and policy and communication is

74
00:04:22,541 --> 00:04:24,910
the Seafood Watch. Um, it's an APP.

75
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,860
It started as a paper card that a consumer
could use to make the best choices

76
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:34,110
about sustainable shellfish,
aquaculture,

77
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:39,070
fish or wild caught fish. And it
kind of works. A, you, you can, um,

78
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:40,660
if you're interested in Mahi Mahi,

79
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,910
you can look at the variety
of places that they come from,

80
00:04:42,911 --> 00:04:44,890
the variety of ways they're
caught and choose the best,

81
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:47,890
most sustainable solution.
And so this is a great example.

82
00:04:47,891 --> 00:04:51,730
We may not be able to reach
the scale of research that,

83
00:04:51,731 --> 00:04:53,140
that a university could do.

84
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:57,640
We may not be able to do the scale of
policy that a federal agency could do,

85
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:01,900
and we may not have the communication
reach of an organization like Google,

86
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:06,040
but we tried to do all of those at the
same time to solve problems. So one,

87
00:05:06,041 --> 00:05:08,890
a brief example of that,
Kyle mentioned Bluefin tuna.

88
00:05:08,891 --> 00:05:12,340
We've been working on Bluefin tuna
in the Pacific, uh, for 20 years.

89
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:16,660
And it's an amazing
creature that, uh, we don't,

90
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,460
that we didn't know a
lot about at that time.

91
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:21,310
And we learned about a Bluefin tuna,

92
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:26,080
three tagging them and through tagging
them by putting a living tags on them,

93
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:29,930
the satellite tags that pop off and
then report a lot of data to us. Uh,

94
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:34,780
how deep the fish one, uh, its
migratory path, it's body temperature,

95
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:39,100
um, it's a celeron mitre
devices on there. Um,

96
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:43,420
and we tag them in the East Pacific
here and we develop these practices.

97
00:05:43,421 --> 00:05:46,930
We innovated these techniques,
these surgeries to do these tags.

98
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:50,680
These fish are about 18
months to five years of age.

99
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:54,670
We tag them in the West Pacific and
Japan when they're of breeding age,

100
00:05:54,671 --> 00:05:57,010
so much larger fish,
much more difficult to work with.

101
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:59,930
And we actually tag the
babies at the various stages.

102
00:05:59,931 --> 00:06:04,400
And so the getting access to those places
really helps us understand where are

103
00:06:04,401 --> 00:06:07,680
they going, how long they're there,
and they're complete life cycle.

104
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:11,360
And I mentioned that we do more
than research. Our goal of course,

105
00:06:11,361 --> 00:06:12,830
is to recover the population.

106
00:06:12,831 --> 00:06:16,670
Is it over 97% depleted
from its historical numbers?

107
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:21,470
And just past year we had a major
victory in getting all the tuna fishing

108
00:06:21,471 --> 00:06:25,310
nations in the Pacific Ocean to
agree to recover the population.

109
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:29,510
And so while science and communication
and working through seafood watch and

110
00:06:29,511 --> 00:06:34,370
celebrity chefs, um, this is our goal.
Now that we have a political agreement,

111
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:38,000
we really have to focus on how we're
going to rebuild it. Everyone says, yes,

112
00:06:38,001 --> 00:06:40,100
we want to rebuild the population.
Now how do we do it?

113
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:42,380
Now Science and research is going
to come back to the forefront.

114
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:47,930
So this is something that I
really use to guide our team.

115
00:06:47,931 --> 00:06:52,100
It's a quote from Ed Catmull who runs
Pixar, wrote a book called Creativity Inc.

116
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:55,280
I really love this because
when we bring scientists in,

117
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:58,580
we expect them to know science.
Yes, we may bring them in,

118
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:01,550
we may train them to do some things,
but we're really going for art.

119
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:05,030
And what I mean by that is, uh,
give you an example from Hawaii.

120
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,310
I lived in Hawaii for seven years.

121
00:07:07,311 --> 00:07:09,200
I worked in a variety of
different capacities there,

122
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:14,380
but we had a problem of only having a
limited dataset of fish populations and

123
00:07:14,481 --> 00:07:15,314
exploitation.

124
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:19,340
It only went back to about
1950 after World War II who
I wasn't even a state yet.

125
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:24,260
And we needed a longer term a data set
in which to make decisions to know about

126
00:07:24,261 --> 00:07:27,290
the status of different fish populations.
And we have this gap.

127
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:30,230
You can see there's a gap
on the x axis between, um,

128
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:35,090
we have two points in 1900 and 1902 when
an economist came out and surveyed the

129
00:07:35,091 --> 00:07:39,230
fish markets in Hawaii. And then we didn't
have any other data until 1950, 1952,

130
00:07:39,231 --> 00:07:43,880
something like that. So what I did
is I went back and I found data,

131
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:44,660
um,

132
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:49,370
in restaurant menus in Waikiki
restaurants and we got about 500 different

133
00:07:49,371 --> 00:07:51,770
restaurant menus. And
on these menus, we're a,

134
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:55,640
just a teeming with marine life
but was fascinating is about,

135
00:07:55,730 --> 00:07:57,380
it wasn't always the same throughout time.

136
00:07:57,381 --> 00:08:00,920
The early menus had all these fish on
there that were high value fish still

137
00:08:00,921 --> 00:08:01,754
today,

138
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:05,480
but just were not being served in the
restaurants and the catch had gone down.

139
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:09,170
So we took a bunch of data off them and
we're actually able to fill in some of

140
00:08:09,171 --> 00:08:13,070
the blanks over time because the menus
went back before the official catch

141
00:08:13,071 --> 00:08:16,800
records did. So that was really
cool. And I have to tell you, uh,

142
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,650
finding these menus,

143
00:08:18,651 --> 00:08:21,470
it's not like there's a Dewey
decimal number for restaurant menus,

144
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:26,450
so it's not like you just go to your
public library. I met some people in,

145
00:08:26,451 --> 00:08:31,070
you know, in their garages. They're there
to, to their grandma in Hawaiian. I'm gay.

146
00:08:31,071 --> 00:08:34,190
I would give them a box of something
and then they had it in the attic or

147
00:08:34,191 --> 00:08:36,560
something like that.
We ended up getting 500 menus,

148
00:08:36,561 --> 00:08:39,780
probably from a hundreds
of different sources. Um,

149
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:43,940
some people collected them as Curios,
as souvenirs of their trip to Hawaii,

150
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:48,710
a cruise from San Diego and the 1930s or
something like that. I cut him off Ebay.

151
00:08:48,711 --> 00:08:51,170
I got them off craigslist.
Uh, all sorts of places.

152
00:08:51,171 --> 00:08:53,540
I met a lot of great people and
heard a lot of great stories,

153
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:57,780
but the reason I'm showing
you this because of it's
because of this plot in the

154
00:08:57,781 --> 00:09:01,230
lower rate, the green
plot, those are the data,

155
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:05,820
but this is my inspiration for them.
I'm sort of quoting the Nepali coast,

156
00:09:05,821 --> 00:09:08,760
if that makes sense.
If anyone's been to the island of Kawaii,

157
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:12,090
it hasn't astounding coastline.
That's what that was.

158
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:15,090
I guess you could say it was sort of made
famous in the movie Jurassic Park when

159
00:09:15,091 --> 00:09:18,930
the helicopter comes in. Um, but
this, these are the data here,

160
00:09:18,931 --> 00:09:21,840
but we're trying to be artful about
it and we're quoting recycling.

161
00:09:21,841 --> 00:09:24,990
This is a paper about Hawaii.
Let's show Hawaii somehow.

162
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:27,660
So the Nepali coast is
kind of embedded in this.

163
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:32,930
Another thing that we've been looking at
is modeling the risk to coral reefs and

164
00:09:34,381 --> 00:09:36,290
the fisheries in the,
in those reefs.

165
00:09:36,291 --> 00:09:39,600
Sort of like the fisheries fallout
from the collapse of reefs.

166
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:40,860
If you want to think about it like that.

167
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:44,160
And we're trying to think about all
sorts of ways to visualize the data.

168
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:48,420
And there is a map and here's
the sort of major ecosystems,

169
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:52,230
the top 29 ecosystems where reefs are
and we're ranking them and trying to

170
00:09:52,231 --> 00:09:55,380
prioritize where risk lies the most.
Um,

171
00:09:55,500 --> 00:10:00,000
but if you perhaps are familiar with
this band from the early eighties were

172
00:10:00,001 --> 00:10:04,470
quoting this album, cover
a joy division. Um, and uh,

173
00:10:04,471 --> 00:10:06,930
there's actually a package within the,

174
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:10,500
the software application are that
you can use. It's called joy plot.

175
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:14,370
And we're just quoting this joy division
because they're kind of a cool band and

176
00:10:14,371 --> 00:10:16,200
it's actually a good way
to visualize the data,

177
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:20,790
but there's all sorts of ways to be
artful about how you discuss the story of

178
00:10:20,791 --> 00:10:22,800
the data and how you visualize it.

179
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,630
And so that's one of the
things we're trying to do.

180
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:30,950
A big thing for us is how do we
observe and analyze data autonomously.

181
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:36,890
Um, you guys are probably in a
similar business, I would imagine. Um,

182
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:40,330
this sort of story begins with Rachel
Carson's book and the 1960 [inaudible]

183
00:10:40,331 --> 00:10:41,164
silent spring.

184
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:44,310
And I think one of the things we really
learned from that is that there's no

185
00:10:44,311 --> 00:10:48,870
such thing as a way what we say.
There's no such thing as a way. Um,

186
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:52,740
and if you're thinking about
sustainability, you're thinking about, um,

187
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:57,990
closing the loop, having a circular
economy, um, waste equals food.

188
00:10:57,991 --> 00:11:00,840
You've probably heard of before.
One of my professors used to say,

189
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:03,630
and this consciousness is really
came because of Rachel spring.

190
00:11:03,631 --> 00:11:06,270
If you throw something in a river,
it doesn't go away.

191
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:08,790
The river takes it to some other place,
right?

192
00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:13,020
And so we're thinking about this in the
North Pacific in terms of microplastic

193
00:11:13,021 --> 00:11:16,920
pollution, it's become, you've probably
heard about plastic in the ocean.

194
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,800
It breaks down to very small,
bit smaller than a millimeter,

195
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:21,090
then it's microplastic.

196
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:26,100
And then it gets into the food web and
it has toxins in the material of the

197
00:11:26,101 --> 00:11:30,660
plastic. It absorbs toxins from the
water column. So on the surface,

198
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:33,870
and then it gets into the food web.
You've probably heard about these,

199
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:37,020
a great Pacific garbage patches,
these gyres,

200
00:11:37,021 --> 00:11:39,690
which sort of physically
concentrate the plastic.

201
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:45,080
And one of the things that
that were really fascinated
by is those are not areas

202
00:11:46,081 --> 00:11:48,450
of high biological importance.

203
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:52,680
We sometimes refer to them as
biological deserts. Actually,

204
00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:57,370
there's area immediately to the south
of this gyre on the right and between

205
00:11:57,371 --> 00:12:01,870
California and Hawaii where we've seen
a lot of great white sharks congregate.

206
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:03,400
It's called the White Shark cafe.

207
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:08,380
And we sort of refer to that as like
the burning man for white sharks because

208
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:10,990
they're going out to, a lot of the
males are going out to the desert.

209
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:15,790
We don't know if it's for to meet someone
special or if it's to get a bite to

210
00:12:15,791 --> 00:12:20,290
eat or to have a, uh, an a,
an experience. Um, but, um,

211
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:25,330
this garbage patch, um, I, I've,
I've not been to the garbage patch,

212
00:12:25,331 --> 00:12:29,020
but on the very periphery of it is the
big island of Hawaii and one of the

213
00:12:29,021 --> 00:12:32,380
beaches they're called Camilo
beach is very famous for its sand,

214
00:12:32,381 --> 00:12:37,030
essentially being plastic because it's
buffering right on the edge of that gyre.

215
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:39,670
And it just sort of scrubs like friction,

216
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:43,000
the plastic out of the water as
it hits the edge of that beach,

217
00:12:43,090 --> 00:12:45,310
and I worked on sea
turtles a lot in Hawaii.

218
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,850
This little hawksbill turtle
is probably four months old.

219
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:53,110
It would fit in the palm of your hand
about nine centimeters long was at shell

220
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:57,190
and it had 41 pieces of plastic
in his gastrointestinal track.

221
00:12:57,460 --> 00:13:00,220
It didn't make it,
and so there's,

222
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:03,880
this is a problem with animals
ingesting it. It's an acute challenge,

223
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:07,300
but there's also this longer
term challenge and we don't
know the implications.

224
00:13:07,301 --> 00:13:09,940
Like I said,
there's a lot of plastic in those gyres,

225
00:13:10,210 --> 00:13:14,740
but the area up top where it goes from
cool green to sort of warmer yellow and

226
00:13:14,741 --> 00:13:19,060
red is this thermocline that we
know is a biodiversity hotspot.

227
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:24,090
It's a path along which whales and turtles
and large fish like Bluefin tuna and

228
00:13:24,911 --> 00:13:27,970
swordfish travel, and it's where
a lot of fisheries congregate.

229
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:33,360
Now how do we get out there and measure
plastic at the scale of thousands

230
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:36,610
kilometers? If we're going to do
that, it's going to be a drone.

231
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:42,750
We can't afford to send big hundreds of
longs foot ships out there that costs

232
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:47,470
tens of thousands of dollars a day.
It's much more feasible to send a drone.

233
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:48,940
So we're going to work with them.
Bari,

234
00:13:48,941 --> 00:13:52,360
the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research
Institute, that's kind of like,

235
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:55,300
it's kind of like your younger
sibling that gets all the cool toys.

236
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:57,160
That's kind of how embar he is for us.

237
00:13:57,430 --> 00:14:02,430
And they have an exceptional talent of
creating sensors and putting them on

238
00:14:03,251 --> 00:14:08,251
vehicles to go observe the places in the
ocean at scale and inaccessible places

239
00:14:09,221 --> 00:14:11,590
like the deep, which is one
of the things they focused on.

240
00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:16,270
And so we're developing technology
to monitor that transition zone,

241
00:14:16,271 --> 00:14:20,080
that area of biological importance in
the North Pacific to really survey it for

242
00:14:20,081 --> 00:14:24,730
plastics because we think that what's
going on with plastic in that place is a

243
00:14:24,731 --> 00:14:28,330
lot more important than what's going
on in the desert by comparison because

244
00:14:28,331 --> 00:14:31,150
that's an ecosystem biodiversity hotspot.

245
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:34,240
So not only observing the data,

246
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:37,990
but interpreting and analyzing
the data needs to be autonomous.

247
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:40,600
We're using this is,
you're not meant,

248
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:42,550
you're not supposed to see
all these individual plots.

249
00:14:42,551 --> 00:14:46,510
There's 268 a spectra from microplastic.

250
00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:50,080
Every little piece of plastic that
we have pulled out of the ocean,

251
00:14:50,081 --> 00:14:54,770
we have to read with a, um, to read
their spectrum to determine what it is.

252
00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:56,660
And we cannot do that manually.

253
00:14:56,661 --> 00:15:01,400
So we're using machine learning algorithms
and neural networks to process these

254
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:02,870
and identify them at scale.

255
00:15:02,871 --> 00:15:07,640
If we were to do this in the ocean at the
scale of the problem, we need to have,

256
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:11,930
we need to match the scale of observation
and the scale of analysis to the scale

257
00:15:11,931 --> 00:15:14,270
of the problem.
And that's an ocean.

258
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:19,520
So we're using autonomous observation
drones and we're using autonomous analysis

259
00:15:19,521 --> 00:15:23,960
and machine learning. But what I
really want to talk about is this.

260
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:29,480
Um, you all are familiar with
search searches, everything,

261
00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:32,840
but you can't do search
if you don't have memory.

262
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:37,970
And so if you don't have memory, you have
nothing. What we're trying to do, uh,

263
00:15:37,971 --> 00:15:41,450
we just opened a new lab in our
conservation, a research group,

264
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:43,130
and it's called the ocean memory lab.

265
00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:48,110
And the idea behind this lab is that we
are trying to build longterm records,

266
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:53,410
a ecological records of the ocean so we
can have proper baselines for ecosystem

267
00:15:53,481 --> 00:15:57,950
health if we don't have that
memory of what a healthy ocean is,

268
00:15:58,070 --> 00:16:02,030
not just the last 10 years, not the
last 40 years, way beyond my lifetime,

269
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:04,640
hundreds of years.
How do we build that record?

270
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:09,230
Because that record is absolutely
integral for understanding where we are,

271
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:13,430
where we need to get back to, and then
perhaps in paths on how to get there.

272
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:16,460
So this is an important,

273
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:20,870
an incredibly important plot is this
carbon dioxide concentration in the

274
00:16:20,871 --> 00:16:25,871
atmosphere as measured from the Mount
of Loa observatory on the Big Island of

275
00:16:26,211 --> 00:16:31,130
Hawaii. And so this is just what I want
to show you is this magic red line.

276
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,510
Let's think of that as a baseline.

277
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:37,430
400 parts per million of carbon dioxide
in the atmosphere is aligned that we had

278
00:16:37,431 --> 00:16:40,670
kind of set several years ago is
something we never wanted to cross.

279
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:44,030
What we've crossed it.
We crossed it and a 2015,

280
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:47,420
I think for the first time and you
can see there's a seasonal cycle,

281
00:16:47,421 --> 00:16:50,950
sort of the air, the planet
breathing rather. And um,

282
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:55,250
it goes up and down with the northern
hemisphere forest in the winter being

283
00:16:55,251 --> 00:16:58,040
deciduous and losing their
leaves and the ocean cycle.

284
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:00,650
Now as I go back and as
I add more data to that,

285
00:17:00,651 --> 00:17:05,150
you can see how far apart the historical
observation is from that red line that

286
00:17:05,151 --> 00:17:08,540
we didn't want to cross in 400.
We go back to 1950.

287
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:10,310
You go back to 1900,

288
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:16,070
we'd go back to 1800 and we
can even go back further now.

289
00:17:16,070 --> 00:17:18,020
How do you think that
this graph was built?

290
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:21,680
You can see there's sort of three
different sections of the graph. Well,

291
00:17:21,681 --> 00:17:24,560
the first part, we can
go back even further. Um,

292
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:29,620
the first part is done with an instrument
measuring it beginning in 1958.

293
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:32,900
You know,
when you've made a good scientific figure,

294
00:17:32,901 --> 00:17:35,900
when they in bronze it and put it
on the side of a building, right?

295
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:38,720
It should be like every scientist
goal that they'll end bronze.

296
00:17:38,721 --> 00:17:41,480
I figure that I've made and maybe my
restaurant menus when we'll get there

297
00:17:41,481 --> 00:17:45,410
someday, but, but, um,
but, but not today. So, um,

298
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:48,770
keeling from Scripps Institute of
Oceanography started these measurements in

299
00:17:48,771 --> 00:17:52,260
1958 and then when they said, you
know, you're onto something here,

300
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:56,370
but we need more data.
We wish you had done that in 1758.

301
00:17:56,371 --> 00:17:57,750
But of course we didn't have sensors,

302
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,730
so how do you think they
went back and build it?

303
00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:04,500
They went through glacial ice cores and
went to Antarctica and dozens of teams

304
00:18:04,501 --> 00:18:07,560
from all over the world of international
collaborators have worked to build this

305
00:18:07,561 --> 00:18:11,640
together. But this plot is
called the keeling curve, right?

306
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:16,620
And this is the absolute
important baseline for us to
measure climate change and

307
00:18:16,621 --> 00:18:19,050
where we are today.
This is what began at all really.

308
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:22,230
And we don't have one
of these for plastic.

309
00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:27,270
We don't have one of these for a lot of
problems. So how do we build this memory?

310
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:30,780
Well,
let's go back to this idea of drones.

311
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:35,690
There is a drone inside.
There's a payload with uh,

312
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:40,290
data and observation scheme,
some sore sensors, uh,

313
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:44,610
some sort of propulsion, there is
energy, there's battery of some sort.

314
00:18:44,611 --> 00:18:49,320
And then probably some sort of way to
transmit the data back to moss landing to

315
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,880
Ambari. Well, what I
would go out to embargo,

316
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:55,560
I say I've been working with
drones my entire professional life,

317
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:59,580
but I've never touched one
of those things. I have
touched one of these things.

318
00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:03,240
This is a sea turtle
shell. And what my, uh,

319
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:07,740
my ideas that actually animals are drones.
They are,

320
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:09,060
they have long,

321
00:19:09,061 --> 00:19:13,470
they have tissues that they take data
on their ecosystem experience and are

322
00:19:13,471 --> 00:19:17,490
recording it and our learning all sorts
of stuff about the conditions of the

323
00:19:17,491 --> 00:19:19,980
ocean.
So let me explain that a bit more.

324
00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:24,530
That's a hawksbill sea turtle
right there. Uh, this turtle, uh,

325
00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:29,940
uh, died many years ago and it was in
a freezer in Hawaii when I got there.

326
00:19:30,090 --> 00:19:34,470
And then we did a necropsy on it. It had
been in a freezer since 1992 and I said,

327
00:19:34,471 --> 00:19:34,591
well,

328
00:19:34,591 --> 00:19:39,591
let's learn something about this animal
that met a bad end and maybe we can get

329
00:19:39,661 --> 00:19:43,230
some information about how to manage
the population better. So this animal,

330
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:47,820
obviously a beautiful show was
not hunted historically for it's,

331
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:48,840
it's a neat,

332
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:53,280
it was used for its show and you
can see why it's gorgeous and,

333
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:56,070
but the thing is within
that and within that Shell,

334
00:19:56,100 --> 00:20:00,600
my idea was that there's probably a
lot of data. So to first we need a,

335
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:02,910
we need some sort of
baseline record of time.

336
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:05,790
And so this is one way
we go about doing this.

337
00:20:05,791 --> 00:20:08,960
This is obviously a nuclear test in,
uh,

338
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:13,830
probably several kilometers away from
where that animal actually died that I

339
00:20:13,831 --> 00:20:18,480
just showed you. And this is in the
Marshall Islands. Um, you can see, um,

340
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:23,370
that this is injecting all sorts of
heavy carbon into the atmosphere,

341
00:20:23,371 --> 00:20:25,140
radiocarbon or 14 carbon.

342
00:20:25,530 --> 00:20:30,530
And what we can do is we can get a map
of the memory of that radioactive carbon

343
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,200
in the system through corals.
And we did this in Hawaii.

344
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:38,730
And you can just see the levels of
radiocarbon are pretty much low background

345
00:20:38,731 --> 00:20:41,700
baseline until about 1950 and
then they start to uptick.

346
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:45,630
They peak in the late sixties
early seventies depending
on where you are on the

347
00:20:45,631 --> 00:20:50,380
planet and then they start to decline
with a nuclear test ban treaty, right?

348
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:54,400
But this right here is a,
is a very helpful,

349
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:59,670
a calendar of radiocarbon that we can
use to understand the timing of these

350
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:06,040
different animals in the ocean. Some of
the most basic things about wildlife,

351
00:21:06,041 --> 00:21:10,180
like a Bluefin tuna or a blue whale
or even a sea turtle is how old is it?

352
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:14,110
How long is it going to live? Where
did it come from, where was it born,

353
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:16,990
where is it going to breed?
These basic questions are really elusive.

354
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:20,680
This is a cross section of one of
those shells that I showed you earlier.

355
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:25,920
We know this animal died in 1976 but
we can micro sample along the various

356
00:21:26,591 --> 00:21:30,970
gradients, kind of like the
grains on a log of wood, right?

357
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:34,270
But one line isn't necessarily one year.

358
00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:39,070
And so what we do is we use tools much
like what your dentist will use to fix a

359
00:21:39,071 --> 00:21:41,260
cavity, a very small, precise drill.

360
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:45,010
And we drill out powder from
there and we analyze the isotopes.

361
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:48,880
And using the radio,
carbon isotopes or bomb radiocarbon,

362
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:53,620
we can actually go back and date each
one of those sections and say, oh,

363
00:21:53,621 --> 00:21:58,510
this animal was born in 1953 at dot.
In 1976 it was 23 years old.

364
00:21:59,050 --> 00:22:03,310
Um, now we can say, oh, this
isn't just a sea turtle shell.

365
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:07,360
It's a clock,
but it's also a passport.

366
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:13,080
It's also a recording toxins and
it's also recording temperature.

367
00:22:14,170 --> 00:22:19,030
There are literally dozens of things we
can get out of that Shell to understand

368
00:22:19,031 --> 00:22:23,740
the experience of that individual
turtle that we can build a record of its

369
00:22:23,741 --> 00:22:28,060
environment. So let me give you a
another example. But before I do that,

370
00:22:28,061 --> 00:22:32,290
I want to explain to you marine food webs
in a very sort of cartoony basic kind

371
00:22:32,291 --> 00:22:35,200
of way. Um, at the very
basic level we have the sun,

372
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:38,170
which is it's trophic position
or trophic level is zero.

373
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:42,880
Something that eats only
the sun is trophic position
of one like phytoplankton.

374
00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:46,750
Something that only eats phytoplankton
is going to be to something that only

375
00:22:46,751 --> 00:22:49,960
eats that like a small, like a sardine
or something is going to be three.

376
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:53,770
A tuna that eats that is going to be
four and then something that eats that is

377
00:22:53,771 --> 00:22:57,910
going to be five so there
are these changes that you
when you go up the food web.

378
00:22:58,270 --> 00:22:58,421
Now,

379
00:22:58,421 --> 00:23:02,200
one of the things that people have looked
over time is to measure the aggregate

380
00:23:02,201 --> 00:23:05,990
performance of a fishery.
By getting its mean trophic levels,

381
00:23:05,991 --> 00:23:07,630
so you look at all the
fish that were caught,

382
00:23:07,870 --> 00:23:11,530
you assign a trophic level to each one,
you weight it by the mass,

383
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:13,390
and then you just scale up.

384
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,840
Now if you look at over time in
different parts of the ocean,

385
00:23:16,841 --> 00:23:20,740
this is the northwest Atlantic, the
northeast Atlantic, the southeast Pacific,

386
00:23:21,010 --> 00:23:24,250
and then the Mediterranean.
You can see as catchin fish goes up,

387
00:23:24,251 --> 00:23:27,460
the trophic position goes down.
That means those food webs are,

388
00:23:27,461 --> 00:23:29,350
those chains are getting smaller.

389
00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:32,530
That's something we want to avoid because
that means the systems are getting

390
00:23:32,531 --> 00:23:34,960
simpler, less complex, less resilient,

391
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:37,000
and they're losing some
of the top predators.

392
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:41,320
Now this has been a subject of a lot of
debates gone back and forth because when

393
00:23:41,321 --> 00:23:46,130
you use fisheries data to measure
the performance of a fishery,

394
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:49,180
there are inherent biases.
Um,

395
00:23:49,181 --> 00:23:53,060
what you can see in this plot and the
lower left is the importance of anchovy.

396
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,980
When the anchovy catch goes up,

397
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:59,690
the trophic position of the aggregate
fishery goes way down because it's a low

398
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:03,940
foraging fish, right? And so there's
been a lot of debate about this. Well,

399
00:24:04,050 --> 00:24:07,280
one of the things we said is trophic
level, kind of an interesting idea,

400
00:24:07,490 --> 00:24:11,690
but maybe if we don't use fisheries
data to measure it, maybe if we use,

401
00:24:11,691 --> 00:24:13,850
because it has inherent economic biases.

402
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:16,910
What if people decide they don't
want to use anchovies anymore?

403
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:19,730
They want to use natural fertilizer
instead of fish fertilizer.

404
00:24:19,970 --> 00:24:24,140
What if there is a moratorium and the u
s on a certain kind of fishery that'll

405
00:24:24,141 --> 00:24:26,540
change the catch.
So the ecosystem isn't changing.

406
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:29,210
It's just the economic rules are changing,
right?

407
00:24:29,330 --> 00:24:31,820
So we actually want to measure what
we're interested in measuring without

408
00:24:31,821 --> 00:24:36,140
artifacts. It's a huge
issue in an observation and
measurement, right? So we said,

409
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:40,400
why don't we look at these birds because
they're also interested in eating fish

410
00:24:40,850 --> 00:24:45,330
and they're like us. They're searching
the ocean for top predatorial fish. Um,

411
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:48,260
but they're not subject to
economic constraints like we are.

412
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:53,030
And one of the things about those cool
drones that embargo it and other people

413
00:24:53,031 --> 00:24:56,540
make is they're fascinating,
but they can't go back in time.

414
00:24:57,770 --> 00:25:02,030
They're not time machines.
But working with museums and repositories,

415
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:03,950
we can actually go back in time.

416
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:06,620
And that study I just showed you
those kind of weighing things,

417
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:10,250
they're based on fisheries statistics,
which are largely after World War Two.

418
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:13,250
So you're limited to dated
back to 1950 of course,

419
00:25:13,251 --> 00:25:17,690
the ocean was changing before 1950 of
course we were fishing before 1950 of

420
00:25:17,691 --> 00:25:17,931
course,

421
00:25:17,931 --> 00:25:22,040
climate change was happening before
1950 so let's go back before 1950 but in

422
00:25:22,041 --> 00:25:23,780
order to do that,
we have to be creative.

423
00:25:24,170 --> 00:25:26,870
And so we started going to
museums and getting seabirds.

424
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:31,610
These birds are from the late 18 hundreds
and we can measure throughout time

425
00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:36,790
there trophic position by looking at the
ratio of amino acids in their feathers.

426
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:41,090
So these birds have thousands of feathers.
These are precious specimens.

427
00:25:41,091 --> 00:25:44,000
We don't want to harm the, but we
can just go in and take two feathers.

428
00:25:44,450 --> 00:25:47,180
You'd net the bird never knows
we, we came in left, right?

429
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:50,930
And even an expert would not even
know that we took those feathers.

430
00:25:50,930 --> 00:25:51,860
We take body feathers,

431
00:25:52,010 --> 00:25:55,880
we don't take the beautiful long primary
flight feathers that like the kinds

432
00:25:55,881 --> 00:25:58,220
you're used to like dipping in an
ink bottle and write writing with.

433
00:25:58,310 --> 00:26:01,880
Now these are like the downy feathers
in the breast. We take two of these,

434
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:05,930
there's another 900, there's another
9,000 they're waiting left. And um,

435
00:26:06,410 --> 00:26:11,000
but importantly, these
resources are already there.
National history repositories,

436
00:26:11,001 --> 00:26:13,580
museum's collections.
There are,

437
00:26:13,581 --> 00:26:18,581
these are all over the world and they're
literally just data archives sitting in

438
00:26:18,771 --> 00:26:19,760
a drawer,
right?

439
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,160
And so we're trying to tap some of the
potential of these to understand longterm

440
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:24,230
trends in the ocean.

441
00:26:24,530 --> 00:26:29,420
We went and use this technique called
compound specific stable isotope analysis

442
00:26:29,450 --> 00:26:31,730
in amino acids kind of
rolls off the tongue,

443
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:34,940
but what we can do is similar
to the heavy carbon theory,

444
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:38,540
this does not a radioisotope this,
this is a stable isotope,

445
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:42,830
but we can look at where they are in the
food level based on the nitrogen that

446
00:26:42,831 --> 00:26:44,400
they're accruing to heavy nitrogen.

447
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:48,510
And what we found in looking at eight
different species is that you can see in

448
00:26:48,511 --> 00:26:53,040
the lower left that pink
plot is an ensemble of all
those pieces of birds there.

449
00:26:53,041 --> 00:26:58,041
Trophic position is declining and it's
almost exactly the same magnitude of

450
00:26:58,711 --> 00:27:01,050
decline as was measured
in the fisheries data.

451
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:04,890
But what's really cool about this is
because they're birds and people are

452
00:27:04,891 --> 00:27:07,440
fascinated by birds,
and I'm studied for birds for a long time,

453
00:27:07,441 --> 00:27:11,790
is we actually know the Diet
of these birds because those,

454
00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:16,970
that dot on there with a huge error bars
is one point in time where some of my

455
00:27:17,371 --> 00:27:20,970
colleagues in Hawaii actually captured
a lot of these birds and looked at their

456
00:27:20,971 --> 00:27:25,971
stomach contents and basically got the
stomach contents of hundreds of seabirds,

457
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:29,520
which you can imagine what that
experience was like. Um, it was,

458
00:27:29,521 --> 00:27:32,340
it was a little pungent, I
would say. Um, but nonetheless,

459
00:27:32,341 --> 00:27:36,210
they reconstructed the diets of all
these animals and we can then we have two

460
00:27:36,211 --> 00:27:40,890
sources of data. Now we have diet
contents, which are pretty primary source,

461
00:27:41,010 --> 00:27:45,060
and then we reconstructed it from the
amino acids in their feathers beginning in

462
00:27:45,061 --> 00:27:47,820
1890 and then sequentially
over time to today.

463
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:53,370
Now what we can do is we have the
trophic levels and we have a diets we can

464
00:27:53,371 --> 00:27:57,390
actually solve for x and we can
actually look at their diets. Over time.

465
00:27:57,630 --> 00:28:01,650
We can reconstruct what the diets would
have been to produce those trophic

466
00:28:01,651 --> 00:28:04,530
levels. And what we can see
if you look in the lower left,

467
00:28:04,531 --> 00:28:09,531
the ensemble for the all species is that
squid populations in the North Pacific

468
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:13,110
have doubled in the last
hundred and 30 years.

469
00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:17,880
So that's just describing what's happening
right through the feathers. This is a,

470
00:28:17,881 --> 00:28:21,410
an albatross a and Albatross of course.
It's an uh,

471
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:26,340
very well known for its ability to fly
very efficiently over long areas in

472
00:28:26,341 --> 00:28:30,810
search La, huge areas of the ocean
with very little energy expended.

473
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:31,980
You may not know this,

474
00:28:31,981 --> 00:28:36,981
but its wing is the archetype for the
Mars plane that's being designed right now

475
00:28:37,201 --> 00:28:40,890
by NASA. This plane has no,
propulsion is just a glider.

476
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:43,830
They're going to drop it in the outer
atmosphere of Mars and it's just going to

477
00:28:43,831 --> 00:28:46,020
descend hopefully at a very slow rate.

478
00:28:46,021 --> 00:28:49,560
They're hoping for three minutes because
the atmosphere has never been measured

479
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:52,200
in Mars. They have a rover
but they don't have a plane.

480
00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:55,860
But the design of his wing has called
a Prendall weeing and it's designed

481
00:28:55,861 --> 00:28:58,320
basically off the same
principles as an albatross wing.

482
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:02,760
So it's a pretty good flyer that's on
how to say. Um, but now that we have,

483
00:29:02,761 --> 00:29:05,400
we can say the trophic positions
have changed over time.

484
00:29:05,970 --> 00:29:10,350
The fish that they're eating has changed
over time. Why is that happening?

485
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:12,600
Well,
here it comes to machine learning again,

486
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,720
we can take various
measurements of eco morphology.

487
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:20,020
We take various measurements of the
climate data in the North Pacific and we

488
00:29:20,021 --> 00:29:23,280
take various ways a data streams,
a fisheries,

489
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:26,550
and we can say all these things could
be affecting why these birds and they're

490
00:29:26,551 --> 00:29:29,040
trophic position is declining.
It could be the birds themselves.

491
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:31,050
Some of them are really
great flyers like Albatross.

492
00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:34,650
Some of them are a little chunkier and
have shorter wings and can't fly as far.

493
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:36,840
Um, then we have all these
things going on with climate.

494
00:29:36,841 --> 00:29:39,750
We have all these things going on
with fisheries. So what's causing it.

495
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:43,150
And so we can run and
apply machine learning,

496
00:29:43,151 --> 00:29:46,300
random forest algorithms and
build models to understand this,

497
00:29:46,301 --> 00:29:50,230
that the human eye or some more standard
statistical methods like general

498
00:29:50,231 --> 00:29:54,730
linearized models can't do.
And we can say that from all of this.

499
00:29:54,731 --> 00:29:58,870
I will tell you that all of those things
matter because these animals don't get

500
00:29:58,871 --> 00:29:59,920
driven by one variable.

501
00:29:59,930 --> 00:30:04,870
They get driven by many variables because
the ocean is a multidisciplinary space.

502
00:30:05,050 --> 00:30:07,180
So if you're an albatross,
you can fly further.

503
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:09,160
But climate change is also happening.

504
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:13,600
And commercial fisheries are also taking
your preferred fish out of the ocean.

505
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:15,790
And so we can do all of those things.

506
00:30:16,090 --> 00:30:19,240
But the important point that I'm trying
to say here is that we started with

507
00:30:19,241 --> 00:30:20,074
feathers.

508
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:24,520
We started with birds in a drawer
that weren't being used for anything.

509
00:30:24,850 --> 00:30:29,050
And we were able to build this whole
story about how the ocean is changing and

510
00:30:29,051 --> 00:30:33,160
how squid populations are growing just
from looking at amino acids in bird

511
00:30:33,161 --> 00:30:36,940
feathers.
So let me give you another example.

512
00:30:36,941 --> 00:30:39,400
Back to home again,
the Monterey Bay.

513
00:30:39,910 --> 00:30:44,080
I mentioned that we have our roots
in the, uh, Stanford, uh, marine lab,

514
00:30:44,081 --> 00:30:46,090
which is right next door.
Hopkins Marine Lab.

515
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:49,630
They've been there at that
location for a hundred years.

516
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:54,300
And they have been every morning since
the early 19 hundreds have been the

517
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:56,500
docent in charge,
uh,

518
00:30:56,530 --> 00:31:00,310
go out and ADM dip a bucket
of water into the ocean,

519
00:31:00,550 --> 00:31:03,100
put a thermometer in it and
measure the temperature.

520
00:31:03,250 --> 00:31:06,160
Now they did that every day of the
week except Sunday for about 10 years.

521
00:31:06,161 --> 00:31:09,370
And then they were like, well, to hell
with that was with the Sunday too. And uh,

522
00:31:09,371 --> 00:31:12,220
so we have this really cool data record,
but we had,

523
00:31:12,221 --> 00:31:16,840
this is going back to instruments
versus proxies, right? About 1919.

524
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:21,310
We have those data records
on the temperature of the
ocean every morning at ADM.

525
00:31:21,850 --> 00:31:25,000
So from those data,
we can learn a few things.

526
00:31:25,090 --> 00:31:26,710
We can look at the average temperature,

527
00:31:26,770 --> 00:31:29,380
but often what's really
important is the extremes.

528
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:33,490
So if I just look at that time
series of thermometer in a bucket,

529
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:35,560
ADM from our colleagues next door,

530
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:40,800
we can see that the hottest week of
the year has changed and has become two

531
00:31:41,981 --> 00:31:46,840
degrees c hotter today than it was
when they first started in 1919.

532
00:31:47,410 --> 00:31:50,350
Okay. So think about that. May
Say, well to seat isn't terrible,

533
00:31:50,890 --> 00:31:55,750
maybe it's not great. Um, but then if
you look at another way of measuring it,

534
00:31:55,780 --> 00:32:00,670
if we look at when that hot week is not
just how hot is that week, the extreme,

535
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:03,760
the, you know, the 50 the
first hottest week of the year,

536
00:32:03,761 --> 00:32:05,110
but not just how hot does it,

537
00:32:05,111 --> 00:32:08,950
but when does it occur and it
occurs about 10 days earlier.

538
00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:13,210
So that's not only happening,
it's a higher magnitude of heat,

539
00:32:13,211 --> 00:32:14,830
but it's actually occurring
earlier in the year.

540
00:32:14,950 --> 00:32:18,130
Not a huge surprise I those things.
But then if you actually say,

541
00:32:18,131 --> 00:32:22,450
let's not look at weeks, let's look at
days and let's look at extreme heat days.

542
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:24,520
This is where it really gets interesting.

543
00:32:24,670 --> 00:32:29,670
And we see there are now 68 more extreme
heat days than there were a hundred

544
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:33,910
years ago.
This is just one century in one place.

545
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:37,450
And this is the value of data
we wouldn't be able to have.

546
00:32:37,510 --> 00:32:40,820
We'll be able to search these records
and come up with these statistics are how

547
00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:43,580
these metrics,
if we didn't have the memory right,

548
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:48,290
but we can actually go back further
than when they were measuring with a

549
00:32:48,291 --> 00:32:52,700
thermometer with um, with a human
actually going out there with the sensor.

550
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:55,550
And that's actually with macro algae.

551
00:32:56,900 --> 00:33:00,920
People have been collecting algae
probably as long as people have been going

552
00:33:00,921 --> 00:33:05,130
into the ocean. It's really easy
to do. Um, it basically, uh,

553
00:33:05,131 --> 00:33:07,580
the procedure goes like this.
You reach down,

554
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:10,750
you pick up the algae and you
put in your pocket. You know,

555
00:33:11,270 --> 00:33:14,180
it's a little bit more complex. Usually
you press it between two pieces of paper.

556
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:19,030
But we have an herbarium at the aquarium
called the herbarium aquarium or

557
00:33:19,031 --> 00:33:19,850
Barium.

558
00:33:19,850 --> 00:33:23,600
And we've been collecting since the late
seventies when we started scoping out

559
00:33:23,601 --> 00:33:26,570
what we were going to win. The aquarium
started getting designed and build.

560
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:31,840
But our neighbors next door have been
collecting algae since the 1890s and even

561
00:33:32,181 --> 00:33:35,270
before a little bit. So
this is the same, uh,

562
00:33:35,271 --> 00:33:38,060
jenness of red algae callow Phyllis.

563
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:42,680
And you can see that even though it's
been kept between two pieces of paper for

564
00:33:42,681 --> 00:33:46,730
100 and uh, almost 30
years, it looks spread.

565
00:33:46,850 --> 00:33:49,730
It still looks the same and it's
in remarkably good condition.

566
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:55,060
So what we can do is we can actually
recreate the temperature of the ocean in

567
00:33:55,371 --> 00:33:58,550
which that Alga specimen lived.

568
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:00,590
By looking at the oxygen isotopes,

569
00:34:00,950 --> 00:34:04,070
we can look at the
nutrients in that ocean.

570
00:34:04,071 --> 00:34:08,630
We can look at the pollution in that
ocean. We can look at, this is a,

571
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:11,360
this is an organism that roots in
the bottom. So it didn't migrate.

572
00:34:11,361 --> 00:34:14,240
So we can't say, oh, what's it's passport?
Did it go to Japan and come back?

573
00:34:14,330 --> 00:34:17,160
It did not do that. We can say
that right now with no one sees.

574
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:20,900
But this is really important. And so what
we're now doing is trying to say, well,

575
00:34:20,901 --> 00:34:24,770
these are all our specimens over time.
We didn't collect it equal amounts,

576
00:34:25,070 --> 00:34:30,070
but we can go back and use these
algae or we can use birds are,

577
00:34:31,791 --> 00:34:33,980
we can use tuna,
we can use auditors,

578
00:34:33,981 --> 00:34:37,490
we can use sharks to really
learn a ton about the ocean.

579
00:34:37,650 --> 00:34:42,140
And we just need to sort of go
into the memory, find the platform,

580
00:34:42,141 --> 00:34:44,570
find the drone,
whatever animal or plant that is,

581
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:48,440
get the sensor out of it and then
recreate that. Thank you very much.

582
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:53,550
[inaudible] if

583
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:56,580
you could prioritize,
I'm sort of interventions,

584
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:59,280
do you have anything you would call out?

585
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:04,470
What sort of interventions
or to like to improve?

586
00:35:04,471 --> 00:35:08,040
Like if we're going on this downward
trend, um, in a lot of ways,

587
00:35:08,070 --> 00:35:11,340
do you have suggestions of focus areas,
you know,

588
00:35:11,341 --> 00:35:16,110
for all of us as consumers are,
you know, I think one of the, uh,

589
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:20,130
before we get there, I think the, um,
it's an important question and it's,

590
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,440
it's the obvious question I think.
Uh,

591
00:35:22,590 --> 00:35:26,700
how do you prioritize what problems
to address and then cause you can't do

592
00:35:26,701 --> 00:35:30,420
everything, but let's just say it's
difficult to do everything. Um,

593
00:35:30,570 --> 00:35:35,370
I would say that one of the issues that's
been really fascinating as a scientist

594
00:35:35,371 --> 00:35:39,900
and a conservationist to observe is
the public engagement on the issue of

595
00:35:39,901 --> 00:35:44,370
microplastic. We were not really concerned
and talking about that 10 years ago,

596
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:47,760
that is not a new issue.
It's been identified for a while.

597
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:52,260
It just really seems to have captured
the environmental consciousness and even

598
00:35:52,261 --> 00:35:55,170
the public consciousness is what do we,
the garbage patch.

599
00:35:55,590 --> 00:35:59,040
And I think the way that we think
about that is now that we know,

600
00:35:59,610 --> 00:36:01,230
let's do something about it.
Right?

601
00:36:01,231 --> 00:36:03,840
That's why Sylvia Earle and others
would say something like that.

602
00:36:03,841 --> 00:36:06,210
I think that's a, that's a really good
way. Now that we have the information,

603
00:36:06,211 --> 00:36:09,180
now that we have the data, what are we
gonna what are we gonna do about it?

604
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:11,220
I think when it comes to plastic,

605
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:16,380
the easiest thing to do is to
not use single use plastic,

606
00:36:16,950 --> 00:36:21,950
a throwaway or recyclable water bottle
that basically has a one use lifetime and

607
00:36:22,441 --> 00:36:25,170
then it gets repurposed to something else.
Um,

608
00:36:25,230 --> 00:36:29,490
and so what I would say is that's
the easiest thing to address,

609
00:36:30,030 --> 00:36:34,590
but it's pervasive. You see single use
plastic and a lot of different places.

610
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:38,220
Um, and I think that would be
something that you can immediately do.

611
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:42,180
I think the choices that we make
when it comes to climate change,

612
00:36:42,570 --> 00:36:45,120
which probably, um, the, the,

613
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:48,690
one of the things that I've heard in these
are very difficult things to measure.

614
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:52,940
But if we were to stop looking at the
issue of climate change versus issue a

615
00:36:52,941 --> 00:36:56,040
plastic, what's more important?
Um, if we were to stop,

616
00:36:56,041 --> 00:36:58,680
if we had a magic button that we
could turn off all carbon emissions,

617
00:36:58,681 --> 00:37:00,840
we could go carbon neutral today.

618
00:37:01,470 --> 00:37:04,620
We would still be dealing with the problem
of climate change 1000 years from now

619
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:09,240
because the earth's climate system
is so complex and the ocean is a huge

620
00:37:09,241 --> 00:37:14,130
reservoir of heat that it takes a
long time for things to equilibrate.

621
00:37:14,670 --> 00:37:18,960
One of the reasons that perhaps climate
change isn't as severe today as it we

622
00:37:18,961 --> 00:37:22,860
might think it would be is because the
ocean is holding so much of the heat.

623
00:37:23,070 --> 00:37:26,640
And so it's like this buffer that's
controlling, um, our climate system.

624
00:37:27,090 --> 00:37:28,470
So a thousand years for climate.

625
00:37:28,710 --> 00:37:32,940
If we were to do the same kind of thing
and magically turn off our plastic and

626
00:37:32,941 --> 00:37:34,620
microplastic pollution switch,

627
00:37:34,890 --> 00:37:38,490
we would probably be dealing
with this for another 40 years.

628
00:37:39,810 --> 00:37:41,730
Very different magnitude of the problem.

629
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:47,160
So climate is probably something that
is going to affect everyone and has been

630
00:37:47,161 --> 00:37:49,000
for decades.
And I would say the choice,

631
00:37:49,110 --> 00:37:52,830
the choices that we make in terms of
our carbon emissions and our carbon

632
00:37:52,831 --> 00:37:56,940
consumption are massive. The food
that you eat, the travel that you do,

633
00:37:57,030 --> 00:38:00,180
the people tuning in from other
places that didn't fly here,

634
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:03,690
that actually are just tuning
in online. Great Choice. Um,

635
00:38:03,750 --> 00:38:06,450
and I think we just need to
prioritize those decisions.

636
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:08,820
We're even looking at this
in our research programs.

637
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:13,680
We have three different research projects
that we could do and we're evaluating

638
00:38:13,681 --> 00:38:16,740
right now. Well, how does
sustainability factor into this?

639
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:20,280
These are all three very, this
is the, it's a, we have a great,

640
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:24,780
we have a great problem. We have three
fascinating research programs. What, um,

641
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:27,960
one project on acts one project
on why one project on Z,

642
00:38:28,110 --> 00:38:30,810
but they're not all the same in
terms of their carbon consumption.

643
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:34,650
Some of them would be maybe require
more energy and that's into our

644
00:38:34,651 --> 00:38:38,170
consciousness right now
about how we prioritize and
choose projects for just for

645
00:38:38,171 --> 00:38:39,004
research.

646
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:44,050
Is there any policy compliant you would
add to the plastic space, you know,

647
00:38:44,051 --> 00:38:45,710
in terms of an intervention you wish.

648
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:52,590
So I'm a scientist and we have a lot
of policy experts that we work with,

649
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,780
but I would say that uh,

650
00:38:54,990 --> 00:38:59,040
policies addressing single use plastic
plastic is so pervasive in our society.

651
00:38:59,041 --> 00:39:02,630
I'm probably am holding plastic
in my hand right now. Um,

652
00:39:02,790 --> 00:39:04,440
but I'm not going to
recycle it or throw it away.

653
00:39:04,441 --> 00:39:07,860
I'm going to use it for a very long
time. And I would say that, uh,

654
00:39:07,890 --> 00:39:11,190
policies relating to single use
plastic are just things that we need to

655
00:39:11,191 --> 00:39:15,180
incentivize that going away. First
of all, thank you so much for coming.

656
00:39:15,330 --> 00:39:17,730
That took was amazing. I
think we all agree. Uh,

657
00:39:17,731 --> 00:39:20,010
one question I was wondering about is,
um,

658
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:24,570
so you talked about this memory lab
that your guys aren't building is,

659
00:39:24,750 --> 00:39:29,500
but you also talked about the creative
ways that you use together all the data

660
00:39:29,501 --> 00:39:32,760
that is, you know, hidden everywhere
and very difficult to find.

661
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:37,740
So it was just wondering is the goal
to open up their lab to everyone?

662
00:39:38,070 --> 00:39:42,330
And I don't know if I have feathers
in my room from 10 years ago. Like,

663
00:39:42,331 --> 00:39:45,850
are you going to encourage
people to participate and, um,

664
00:39:46,170 --> 00:39:50,940
put the data that they might have at
the disposal of the aquarium and also,

665
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:55,860
uh, are you going to make
the data available to other
scientists and Greg, uh,

666
00:39:55,930 --> 00:39:59,370
other people? That's a great
question. So the first thing is,

667
00:39:59,371 --> 00:40:02,370
I want to say is I've had written
above my desk for a long time.

668
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:06,060
More data is more better, right?
Even though the grammar isn't great,

669
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:09,720
the people get what I
mean by that. Um, so, uh,

670
00:40:09,750 --> 00:40:13,470
when I was doing the menu's project in
Hawaii, we, there's this thing in Hawaii,

671
00:40:13,471 --> 00:40:17,850
you may not have heard of
it called coconut wireless.
It's the word getting out.

672
00:40:18,030 --> 00:40:22,680
You know, um, it's a, it's a, it's a
joke of course is the gossip train.

673
00:40:22,830 --> 00:40:24,720
And, uh, when I was
working on this project,

674
00:40:24,870 --> 00:40:29,390
coconut wireless who is in full
effect and I would get people, um,

675
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:33,510
and then when we published
the study and it was on NPR,

676
00:40:33,690 --> 00:40:36,660
I got a lot of random solicitations.
People just sent me stuff in the mail.

677
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:40,320
But I would get calls and saying,
Hey, I have five menus from 1960.

678
00:40:40,470 --> 00:40:43,260
Do you want them? And I'm like,
yes, of course I do. So, um,

679
00:40:43,290 --> 00:40:44,190
when it comes to wildlife,

680
00:40:44,191 --> 00:40:47,490
it's a little trick here because do you
tend to any permits? So we wouldn't say,

681
00:40:47,491 --> 00:40:51,630
hey, here's a, here's an open data call
for sea bird feathers because we want the,

682
00:40:51,750 --> 00:40:56,560
the pros to do that, um, and permitted
fashion. But I would say that, um,

683
00:40:57,090 --> 00:41:02,080
yes, there will be, we are going to
be increasingly communicating, uh,

684
00:41:02,130 --> 00:41:06,870
with the general public about ways they
can get involved and contribute data to

685
00:41:06,871 --> 00:41:09,000
our, to our projects. And as we do that,

686
00:41:09,001 --> 00:41:12,830
I think that's an incredible point cause
crowdsourcing and involving citizens

687
00:41:12,870 --> 00:41:16,560
science is a, is a very big
component of where we're going.

688
00:41:16,830 --> 00:41:20,940
On the second question about open,
open access, open source. Um,

689
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:22,680
we're a nonprofit and it's,

690
00:41:22,710 --> 00:41:27,290
it's one of our core values to be open
access and open source Ambari. Um,

691
00:41:27,330 --> 00:41:30,990
they make some amazing devices and
then they put the blueprints online.

692
00:41:31,770 --> 00:41:35,800
It's really amazing that they, that
um, because they're the same, they're,

693
00:41:35,810 --> 00:41:38,750
they had the same DNA as we do.
Uh, we want to be open access.

694
00:41:38,751 --> 00:41:41,660
So we use open science framework,
we use get hub,

695
00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:46,490
we use fixed share research gate.
We put all of our publications online.

696
00:41:46,491 --> 00:41:51,080
We're increasingly trying to work with
only open access journals because we want

697
00:41:51,081 --> 00:41:55,160
to work with people all over the world
who may not have access to a university

698
00:41:55,161 --> 00:41:58,910
library in which those things are
free and openly available. So we,

699
00:41:58,911 --> 00:42:02,030
it's a huge value of ours
to make our data accessible,

700
00:42:03,050 --> 00:42:06,530
to invite people into our
research projects in a way
that they can meaningfully

701
00:42:06,531 --> 00:42:09,770
contribute. I mean, be a
coauthor in our work. Um,

702
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:13,310
we want to solve problems and we know
we need more data and more experts.

703
00:42:13,311 --> 00:42:17,420
We firmly believe in the theory of plenty
at the more eyes and the more minds

704
00:42:17,421 --> 00:42:19,280
you have in a project,
the more comes out of it.

705
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:23,090
It's not like we have to Gollum it.
Um, so we can get all the glory.

706
00:42:23,091 --> 00:42:27,240
That's not our position at all. We want
to, um, open science, open access is,

707
00:42:27,241 --> 00:42:29,060
is where we are. So yes, and we're,

708
00:42:29,061 --> 00:42:33,380
we're building the data infrastructure
to make that seamlessly happen.

709
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:35,870
And then the user interface,
it's very intuitive.

710
00:42:37,010 --> 00:42:40,160
I think some of the problems that were
actually, I'll go even a step further.

711
00:42:40,310 --> 00:42:42,020
Some of the problems
that we're dealing with,

712
00:42:42,470 --> 00:42:45,680
everyone in this room may be in the
choir and maybe like super onboard,

713
00:42:45,830 --> 00:42:47,000
but there,
let's be honest,

714
00:42:47,001 --> 00:42:50,450
there are some more difficult issues
that aren't so obvious and have to get

715
00:42:50,451 --> 00:42:55,220
people with disparate beliefs and
political persuasions to agree on.

716
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:58,450
So one of the things that we're doing
when we publish a paper or now a

717
00:42:58,451 --> 00:43:02,310
publishing, uh, transparent gooeys uh,

718
00:43:02,330 --> 00:43:06,620
graphical user interfaces to let people
say, well we did the study this way,

719
00:43:06,621 --> 00:43:10,010
but if you pull the dials in different
ways you can get a different answer.

720
00:43:10,190 --> 00:43:12,890
So some of the problems we're solving,
we're trying to actually recruit,

721
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:16,970
do it a different way and I think that's
where science is going to be going with

722
00:43:16,971 --> 00:43:19,240
much more interactive where the,

723
00:43:19,241 --> 00:43:24,230
the analytical framework is on the
backend and you just have a user interface

724
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:26,450
and you're using machine learning,

725
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:29,930
you're just pushing little dials with
your mouse and that's where we're going to

726
00:43:29,931 --> 00:43:33,470
be going through things like um,
um,

727
00:43:34,070 --> 00:43:37,070
the frameworks usually on the ar
platform where we can do this.

728
00:43:37,580 --> 00:43:42,000
Yeah. What you were just
referring to with how you're

729
00:43:43,730 --> 00:43:48,730
building your research now so that it
can be more presentable to people with

730
00:43:49,011 --> 00:43:49,581
other views.

731
00:43:49,581 --> 00:43:54,230
Is that how you're making
it more open to things like,

732
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:54,950
um,

733
00:43:54,950 --> 00:43:59,210
getting fisheries onboard for things like
cds with Bluefin and things like that?

734
00:43:59,211 --> 00:44:04,130
Cause I know in the past it's been a
challenge to get the fisheries and other

735
00:44:04,340 --> 00:44:09,140
people, lobbyists, stuff like that on
board with getting protected fisheries,

736
00:44:09,350 --> 00:44:12,320
all of that, all of that
fun stuff integrated. Um,

737
00:44:12,890 --> 00:44:16,910
just the challenge of having
an species protected and sure,

738
00:44:17,090 --> 00:44:20,900
scientists working together with all of
that, you can put it more eloquently.

739
00:44:20,901 --> 00:44:23,060
I'll let you do that.
So that's the main question.

740
00:44:23,061 --> 00:44:28,061
Is there a way to get science working
together with people who wish to deny

741
00:44:29,850 --> 00:44:31,410
science or use it in a way,

742
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:36,000
um, that supports fisheries
versus science? Sure.

743
00:44:36,410 --> 00:44:39,270
It's a great question. I
would say that, um, oh,

744
00:44:39,390 --> 00:44:43,680
what I would say is that a lot of people
care about Bluefin tuna for different

745
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:48,430
reasons. And um, I think everyone
pretty much cares about bluefin tuna,

746
00:44:48,431 --> 00:44:52,350
h just for different incentives and their
incentives are prioritized differently.

747
00:44:52,410 --> 00:44:53,610
If you're a Bluefin tuna fishermen,

748
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:58,210
you can't fish for blue's name if
there are no bluefin. So, um, it's,

749
00:44:58,360 --> 00:45:00,920
it's in everyone's interest
for there to be Bluefin tuna.

750
00:45:00,921 --> 00:45:03,000
It's just how much are
extracted every year.

751
00:45:03,210 --> 00:45:07,260
But I think that what you're getting at
is exactly the point is that when we do

752
00:45:07,261 --> 00:45:09,150
analyses and we come to conclusion,

753
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:13,170
we not only want to be transparent
about the data, about how he got there,

754
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:15,330
but then we say,
and here,

755
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:18,510
here's the interactive where you
can choose your own incentives.

756
00:45:18,630 --> 00:45:21,510
Think about a situation like, um, um,

757
00:45:22,290 --> 00:45:26,490
choosing where to put a marine protected
area and preserve in the ocean.

758
00:45:27,010 --> 00:45:27,390
Um,

759
00:45:27,390 --> 00:45:32,390
if your incentives are to protect climate
change or to rebuild fisheries or to

760
00:45:33,751 --> 00:45:36,330
have a variety of other things,

761
00:45:36,660 --> 00:45:41,190
those places could show up differently
in the ocean to protect biodiversity. Um,

762
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:45,380
and what we can do is we can
say, here are the 10 most, uh,

763
00:45:45,381 --> 00:45:49,440
that the top 10 market share of
ideas for ocean conservation,

764
00:45:49,620 --> 00:45:52,440
for marine protected areas.
We can build those data layers there,

765
00:45:52,441 --> 00:45:54,600
exists now and we could say,

766
00:45:54,690 --> 00:45:58,560
and you can weight them however you
want this one 10, this one, zero,

767
00:45:58,561 --> 00:46:00,630
this one five.
And then it gives you a map.

768
00:46:01,140 --> 00:46:04,230
That's what we're working on right now.
It was kinds of interactive

769
00:46:04,870 --> 00:46:09,870
with the success at places like problem
Fomo is easier to prove that it's

770
00:46:11,630 --> 00:46:16,630
capable to bring back the species and
biodiversity easier to show the fisheries

771
00:46:18,831 --> 00:46:21,690
and official manner that it
is possible to bring it back.

772
00:46:22,690 --> 00:46:24,130
It's been wiped out such

773
00:46:24,130 --> 00:46:26,200
a manner.
So there you mentioned Cabo Pomo,

774
00:46:26,201 --> 00:46:29,470
there's some great success
stories of conservation working.

775
00:46:29,740 --> 00:46:33,220
I would just look at the great whales
in the Pacific Ocean blue whale,

776
00:46:33,310 --> 00:46:35,080
humpback whale gray whale.

777
00:46:35,230 --> 00:46:38,830
These are basically candidates
for removing from the
endangered species list now,

778
00:46:39,250 --> 00:46:43,760
um, because their populations have
been growing at three to 6% a year, um,

779
00:46:43,780 --> 00:46:46,800
ever since they put a moratorium
on whaling. And so, uh,

780
00:46:46,900 --> 00:46:51,550
what's amazing is if you don't
kill whales, they actually do well.

781
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:55,720
And I think that's something
everyone agrees on one. Um,

782
00:46:56,050 --> 00:46:58,330
and so there was a lot
of examples like that.

783
00:46:58,360 --> 00:47:01,330
And so it's just how do you get
protection? How do you get to,

784
00:47:01,510 --> 00:47:06,510
how do you serve the dual mandate of
commercial fisheries and conservation?

785
00:47:07,930 --> 00:47:10,570
That's the question.
And how much do you weigh in which one?

786
00:47:10,571 --> 00:47:15,310
And I think when you move
towards it, a data rich, open,

787
00:47:16,030 --> 00:47:19,060
relatable, interactive
framework, a lot of the,

788
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:22,870
a lot of the disagreements can
be a back beat, can be about,

789
00:47:23,140 --> 00:47:26,950
we don't trust your data,
we don't trust your methods and,

790
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:30,460
and you're doing it behind closed doors
and not inviting us to be a part of it.

791
00:47:30,460 --> 00:47:34,780
Well, all of those disagreements go
away when you make the data available.

792
00:47:35,050 --> 00:47:39,160
When you make the processes transparent
and rational and when you make their

793
00:47:39,161 --> 00:47:42,370
interactives online,
that really anyone can,

794
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:44,290
can very intuitively understand.

795
00:47:44,291 --> 00:47:46,780
And that's what I think is we're
trying to meet everyone where that,

796
00:47:46,781 --> 00:47:51,520
cause all of those complaints are
totally valid. We don't want secret data.

797
00:47:51,550 --> 00:47:52,600
We don't want to secret methods.

798
00:47:52,601 --> 00:47:55,870
We don't have any secret rooms with secret
decisions when it all to be out there.

799
00:47:56,290 --> 00:47:58,280
The whole point of science is that it's,

800
00:47:58,630 --> 00:48:02,110
it's a Galitary and a
democratic and accessible. Um,

801
00:48:02,111 --> 00:48:05,260
and so we need to have the infrastructures
and the platforms to make it that way.

802
00:48:05,790 --> 00:48:10,380
So when you were talking about the keeling
curve measuring the co two levels and

803
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:13,240
uh, that at 1958 and onwards I think, uh,

804
00:48:13,290 --> 00:48:14,820
we have an instrument
that I guess is very,

805
00:48:14,821 --> 00:48:18,000
very good at this and
before it's more of a proxy,

806
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:23,480
how do you align the data from the two
and possibly even maybe many disparate

807
00:48:23,641 --> 00:48:24,960
historical sources.

808
00:48:25,170 --> 00:48:29,660
How do you make sure that they are
calibrated or that sort of thing for

809
00:48:29,670 --> 00:48:31,410
something like this with
the ocean when we left, hmm.

810
00:48:31,510 --> 00:48:32,590
I think it's like a symphony.

811
00:48:32,890 --> 00:48:35,260
You have a bunch of different instruments
and you're trying to make a coherent

812
00:48:36,100 --> 00:48:39,040
narrative out of it. And
uh, when it comes to,

813
00:48:39,041 --> 00:48:42,520
I'm less of an expert on the COO
two series and it, that is a,

814
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:46,570
is a lot of research groups from a lot
of countries and a lot of NSF funding and

815
00:48:46,571 --> 00:48:49,660
a lot of major programs that went
into building that curve. It May,

816
00:48:49,661 --> 00:48:51,280
you may look at that curve and say,
oh,

817
00:48:51,281 --> 00:48:55,690
it's just a simple graph and it's
so much work went into that graph.

818
00:48:55,870 --> 00:48:59,680
Sometimes when you look at the
figures and we can just scrape data,

819
00:48:59,980 --> 00:49:02,950
put a cool vis together in like an hour,

820
00:49:03,610 --> 00:49:04,900
and then you look at something like that.

821
00:49:04,901 --> 00:49:09,901
And that is like PhDs and careers in a
wards in the huge amount of effort went

822
00:49:11,441 --> 00:49:12,810
into that.
But getting,

823
00:49:12,910 --> 00:49:17,910
getting together a proxy and a calibrated
Dataset is usually the beginning of a

824
00:49:19,241 --> 00:49:23,110
lot of the thought of some of our
projects is we start with some sort of

825
00:49:23,111 --> 00:49:26,740
training set and then we
start with something that
we think is a good proxy and

826
00:49:26,741 --> 00:49:30,460
how do we add those two together so that
we can take the training set away and

827
00:49:30,461 --> 00:49:33,400
then we can do it at scale. This is
what we're doing with microplastic.

828
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:36,910
When we look at the
Ramond laser spectroscopy,

829
00:49:37,030 --> 00:49:42,030
we trained the spectra on known types
and then we go out and we do the proxies.

830
00:49:42,041 --> 00:49:46,930
The problem is is that plastic in the
ocean is been tumbled around in the waves

831
00:49:46,931 --> 00:49:48,820
are at depth,
extreme temperatures,

832
00:49:48,821 --> 00:49:52,390
different acidities in an
animal's stomach for a while.

833
00:49:52,540 --> 00:49:54,370
So it's a lot not pristine.
So we,

834
00:49:54,460 --> 00:49:59,460
but that's actually part of the magic
because we can actually now using

835
00:49:59,741 --> 00:50:03,010
spectroscopy, we're working to
age some of these particles.

836
00:50:03,011 --> 00:50:05,050
We can say not only is it nylon,

837
00:50:05,290 --> 00:50:07,240
but it's nylon has been
in the ocean for 40 years.

838
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:10,600
That's really helpful
information as opposed to saying,

839
00:50:10,601 --> 00:50:15,601
well 40% of it's not on 40%
of its polycarbon and in
40% of its polyamide or has

840
00:50:15,791 --> 00:50:18,610
more than a hundred percent but
um, but you, you get the idea.

841
00:50:18,611 --> 00:50:22,180
But I think just having those training
sets, when you go back in time,

842
00:50:22,780 --> 00:50:25,510
the error bars can get a little broader.
And so it's just,

843
00:50:26,290 --> 00:50:30,470
the question is just realizing the limits
of your data and using a training set

844
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:34,670
that is unassailable. I say that's
our general approach going about it.

845
00:50:35,780 --> 00:50:39,260
Some proxies are, are more difficult than
others and sometimes it's a proxy of,

846
00:50:39,510 --> 00:50:40,281
it's like a metro,

847
00:50:40,281 --> 00:50:43,610
she Goodall of data and then you get
that little thing on the inside. Right.

848
00:50:43,790 --> 00:50:46,220
And we want to have,
we wanted to kind of limit our proxies,

849
00:50:46,820 --> 00:50:50,750
but it's amazing what you can do if
you have some data to begin with.

850
00:50:50,751 --> 00:50:53,570
As opposed to nothing.
Thank you very much.
