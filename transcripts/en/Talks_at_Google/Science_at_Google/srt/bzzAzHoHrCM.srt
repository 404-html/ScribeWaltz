1
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:11,000
Dr Lila hatch from Noah with the s,
uh,

2
00:00:11,001 --> 00:00:13,280
the marine ecologist with Stellwagen Bank,

3
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:15,170
which is off the coast of Massachusetts.

4
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:20,210
And we have Katie more program director
at the International Fund for Animal

5
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:23,000
Welfare.
I'm a biologist by training.

6
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:26,750
I'm the director of the Animal Rescue
Program at the International Fund for

7
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:30,890
Animal Welfare, which is actually
headquartered on Cape Cod. Um, and

8
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:34,070
in relation to this,
um,

9
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:38,660
part of my job is to direct our marine
mammal rescue and research team, um,

10
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:42,710
which is based here on the Cape and
responds to strandings basically from a

11
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:47,290
Plymouth south to the Rhode Island
border. And, um, we have, uh,

12
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:51,460
the unique privilege of being in an area
where we have regular mass strandings

13
00:00:51,461 --> 00:00:54,940
of marine mammals. Um,
usually, uh, pilot whales,

14
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:58,180
Whiteside of dolphins and
common dolphins on Cape Cod.

15
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:03,100
And it's one of the three top hotspots
globally for mass strandings. Um,

16
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:05,440
and what makes us a
little bit different than,

17
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:10,180
than some of these other places in, for
example, Madagascar in this case is that,

18
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:13,480
um,
mass strandings on kid caught up,

19
00:01:13,481 --> 00:01:18,370
been happening for centuries and
you can go back into pilgrim logs.

20
00:01:18,371 --> 00:01:19,720
And actually read about masterminding.

21
00:01:19,721 --> 00:01:24,580
So we know that the events here predate
the industrialized ocean and predate a

22
00:01:24,581 --> 00:01:25,361
lot of this noise.

23
00:01:25,361 --> 00:01:28,810
And so they're considered
kind of a natural mass
stranding and we use them kind

24
00:01:28,811 --> 00:01:33,280
of as a control group. Um, for
comparison to other groups. Um,

25
00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:35,910
what has developed in is very different.
Um,

26
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:41,040
in terms of what we do now is part of
what we do in our response is actually to

27
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:44,200
test the hearing of the dolphins
that strand in our area.

28
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:47,410
I'm a technology we didn't have in
hand when the stranding happened in

29
00:01:47,411 --> 00:01:49,970
Madagascar. And so that's, um,

30
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:54,120
kind of a new advantage we have to
getting some background data, uh,

31
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:58,990
in terms of mitigation. And we actually
use sound to our advantage in some cases,

32
00:01:59,050 --> 00:01:59,883
um,

33
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:04,540
using acoustic deterrence to drive
potential groups of animals that will

34
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:07,900
potentially mass strand in our hot spot
areas like Wellfleet and other spots and

35
00:02:07,901 --> 00:02:10,520
Cape Cod bay, and using
it to actually, um,

36
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:13,900
drive animals further off shore
and prevent them from stranding.

37
00:02:13,901 --> 00:02:17,440
So in some respects we're using
sound to our advantage. Um,

38
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:19,430
but that's where I stand with it.

39
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:24,390
Um, I, uh, um,

40
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:27,780
have a variety of where a different
variety of different hats working for the

41
00:02:27,781 --> 00:02:31,290
federal government on this issue. Um, um,

42
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:36,060
the National Oceanic and atmospheric
administration where I work, um, manages,

43
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:38,520
um,
a national marine sanctuary,

44
00:02:38,521 --> 00:02:42,330
which is the vast majority
of Massachusetts Bay
right off the shore here.

45
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:47,250
And our mandate is to protect all the
resources of that site, which include,

46
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:52,140
um, uh, very rich populations of
fish and marine invertebrates.

47
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:56,490
All of us, many of which are acoustically
sensitive and active make, make sounds.

48
00:02:56,491 --> 00:02:58,080
You sound very actively.

49
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:03,610
And the famous cod for which we call
Cape The Cape Cod is an incredibly

50
00:03:03,611 --> 00:03:05,860
acoustically, um, uh,

51
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:09,130
active fish makes sounds when it spawns,

52
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:14,050
uses those sounds to organize
it's courtship behavior.

53
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:15,850
So this is a,

54
00:03:15,851 --> 00:03:20,851
this is an issue that is way richer
than marine mammals and the whales.

55
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:24,910
Um, and, uh, so I work
on a research program,

56
00:03:24,911 --> 00:03:27,160
developing a research program,
um,

57
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:30,600
to look at what the influence is of,
uh,

58
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:35,770
underwater noise that humans produce on
this wealth of species in the sanctuary

59
00:03:35,771 --> 00:03:36,850
context here.

60
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:42,270
And then the majority of my time now
actually I spend trying to work on our

61
00:03:42,851 --> 00:03:47,280
agencies, many, many
legal mandates for um,

62
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:52,290
improving protection for marine a marine
life and our mandates stretch from a

63
00:03:53,921 --> 00:03:58,630
lot of the things you saw
references to a in some ways in, in,

64
00:03:58,631 --> 00:03:59,650
in that we've done,

65
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:04,680
we've passed laws in the 70s that protect
marine mammal populations above other

66
00:04:05,171 --> 00:04:09,280
populations. Um, and we, um, uh,

67
00:04:09,281 --> 00:04:12,850
have particular mandates to protect
endangered species and then we have

68
00:04:12,851 --> 00:04:15,120
additional mandates to um,

69
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:20,270
ensure the sustainable ability to
harvest fish and marine invertebrates in

70
00:04:20,741 --> 00:04:24,700
fisheries. And all of those diverse
mandates are part of Noah's portfolio.

71
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:26,160
And um,

72
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:30,880
usually they include inability to
protect populations or understand the

73
00:04:30,881 --> 00:04:34,540
influence of human stressors and
noise is a big part of that portfolio,

74
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:36,430
increasingly large part of that portfolio.

75
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:40,300
So I work on the agencies
development of a new,

76
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:45,610
a 10 year vision for how to get our
arms around the fact that noise is

77
00:04:45,611 --> 00:04:47,380
increasing at this exponential rate.

78
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:52,680
The fact that it really does challenge
a lot of the legal mechanisms and his

79
00:04:53,771 --> 00:04:54,830
scientific mechanisms,

80
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:59,740
we have to address it and to try to make
sure that over the next decade we're in

81
00:04:59,741 --> 00:05:03,640
a better position to, to
address this issue. So that's,

82
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:06,760
that's sort of what my task is.
Oh,

83
00:05:06,761 --> 00:05:11,050
and when you wanted us to talk a little
bit about mitigation, right? Mitigation,

84
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:15,010
um, uh, it is an incredibly rich topic.

85
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:18,130
I won't go on for a long time,
but I'll just sort of touch on.

86
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:22,960
You heard the influence of sound
talked about. Um, in fact, Katie,

87
00:05:22,961 --> 00:05:25,900
you did a really nice job of in the film,
you know,

88
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:28,460
reminding people that there are,
um,

89
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:31,000
sometimes we make it into two categories,

90
00:05:31,001 --> 00:05:32,470
but really it's a little richer than that,

91
00:05:32,471 --> 00:05:37,330
but to at least two ways that
we consider noise influence. Um,

92
00:05:37,331 --> 00:05:40,810
and one is an injury,
direct trauma to ears,

93
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:46,170
either temporary or permanent loss of
hearing or in really extreme cases,

94
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:50,860
um, uh, death to the actual animal
just due to trauma to the physical,

95
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:53,770
the animals physiology.
Um,

96
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:58,640
then there's all of these adversive
strong adversive behavioral responses that

97
00:05:58,641 --> 00:06:01,490
can lead to mortality is which
you heard a lot of reference to.

98
00:06:01,491 --> 00:06:04,250
That's not trauma to the,
it can include trauma to the ear.

99
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:08,720
If indeed the animal in
responding, um, goes through these,

100
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:13,750
these decompression Ben
scenarios or they're adversion
winds them up on a beach,

101
00:06:13,851 --> 00:06:16,190
then you can have mortality.
Um,

102
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:21,140
so there's these extreme
behavioral responses and
then there's an enormous gray

103
00:06:21,141 --> 00:06:23,810
zone of things that are way,

104
00:06:23,811 --> 00:06:26,930
way more difficult to get on top of.

105
00:06:26,931 --> 00:06:31,100
And that you may think of as associated
with a lot of different environmental

106
00:06:31,101 --> 00:06:33,740
issues that we deal with,
which is sub lethal impacts,

107
00:06:33,741 --> 00:06:35,900
things that don't kill the animal.
Um,

108
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:39,860
but that we get concerned about happening
to them repeatedly in their lifetime

109
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:44,690
or happening to them chronically
in their lifetime. So mitigations,

110
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,820
there's a suite of mitigations that
we've gotten better and better at, um,

111
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:52,430
to address those lethal conditions,
especially for marine mammals.

112
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:55,820
Mechanisms for first off,

113
00:06:55,821 --> 00:07:00,590
trying to reduce the co-occurrence
of animals, doing something,

114
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,550
anything actually anything at that close
proximity that will lead to any kind of

115
00:07:04,551 --> 00:07:06,210
lethal interaction.
Um,

116
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:10,430
and that includes ramping up a source
more slowly and some conditions that's

117
00:07:10,431 --> 00:07:11,960
effective in some did conditions.

118
00:07:11,961 --> 00:07:15,500
It's not the most effective
thing is to reduce,

119
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:20,730
to use everything we can to
understand where animals are.

120
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:25,040
It's not an easy, easy task. And to, um,

121
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:30,230
have the activity described and in such
a way that they're not going to do it in

122
00:07:30,231 --> 00:07:33,740
that space and in that time.
So restrict activities in,

123
00:07:33,741 --> 00:07:37,520
in time and space to reduce their
co-occurrence with animals. That's the,

124
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:41,540
that's what in the prime mitigation
techniques associated with these acute

125
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:43,460
effects.
Um,

126
00:07:43,461 --> 00:07:47,750
and it also starts to get out of some of
these additional sub lethal influences

127
00:07:47,751 --> 00:07:49,250
of,
you know,

128
00:07:49,251 --> 00:07:53,180
an animal may not have such an adversive
reaction that it winds up on the beach,

129
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:58,510
but it may have its feeding disrupted
and you may not worry about that if it

130
00:07:58,791 --> 00:07:59,624
happens once.

131
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:03,860
But if it's in a location where there's
a lot of activity that's disruptive and

132
00:08:03,861 --> 00:08:08,480
it's during a really important
biological activity, um, like,

133
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:12,140
um, this is a really Kunsthalle a lot
of marine mammal populations have very

134
00:08:12,141 --> 00:08:17,120
constricted feeding times where
they're focused on, um, uh,

135
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:21,980
patches of prey that are in that
space and time and need to be, um,

136
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:25,970
they need to be efficiently Eaton.
And if they're getting disturbed,

137
00:08:25,971 --> 00:08:29,810
there's a caloric effect on, you know,
just reducing the fitness of that animal,

138
00:08:29,811 --> 00:08:33,170
reducing their ability to get the
calories they need. It's a very odd,

139
00:08:33,171 --> 00:08:34,880
if you think about what a whale is,

140
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:39,890
it's an extremely odd
evolutionary phenomenon to
have the largest animals in the

141
00:08:39,891 --> 00:08:44,030
world dependent on eating
a gigantic amount of the
smallest amount of animals in

142
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:45,380
the world.
And that's,

143
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:50,410
that was all built at the whole thing
works because of the relative predict,

144
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:53,570
uh,
predictiveness of an animal.

145
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:58,380
Being able to find those concentrations
and being able to take them in quickly.

146
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:02,890
And so if you mess up their
ability for them to, um, uh,

147
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:07,910
use that header heterogeneously
distributed resource the way they have to,

148
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:11,970
they don't have a lot of access to
another evolutionary mechanism to make up

149
00:09:11,971 --> 00:09:13,530
that bad amount of calories.

150
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:18,600
So these are these sub lethal sweet and
that doesn't even get to the thing that

151
00:09:18,601 --> 00:09:20,960
I actually concentrate
on the most and that I'm,

152
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:23,340
the reason that in the film
I concentrated on shipping,

153
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:27,930
which is that hum in the background and
the hum in the background is something

154
00:09:27,931 --> 00:09:30,690
we're really just starting
to understand for humans.

155
00:09:30,691 --> 00:09:34,950
So you can imagine why it's a difficult
thing to get regulations to understand

156
00:09:34,951 --> 00:09:36,690
for marine critters,

157
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:40,500
which is if it's simply a
louder in the background,

158
00:09:40,501 --> 00:09:44,790
what are all the different kinds of
signals that animals are dependent on

159
00:09:44,791 --> 00:09:46,920
hearing that they now lose access to.

160
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:52,260
And we're so focused on whales as
communicators between each other and their

161
00:09:52,261 --> 00:09:53,160
signals.
So there's,

162
00:09:53,161 --> 00:09:56,160
the first thing we think about is the
loss of the ability to hear each other.

163
00:09:56,161 --> 00:09:58,890
And that's what we're talking about in
the film in terms of right whales being

164
00:09:58,891 --> 00:10:02,100
able to hear each other calling,
what are the ramifications of that?

165
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,970
But actually what we know from
terrestrial wildlife and birds,

166
00:10:05,971 --> 00:10:08,400
all these other critters is that,
um,

167
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:13,460
they're using all kinds of sounds and
the natural environment to detect, um,

168
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:16,130
where's a good place to settle,
um,

169
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:21,170
to hear echoes over very large areas of
space that tell them something about,

170
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:23,920
um, the, the, the conditions of the,

171
00:10:23,921 --> 00:10:28,110
the bottom that will tell them about
the predictability of food resources.

172
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:31,590
Definitely the ability to hear predators,
the ability to detect,

173
00:10:31,591 --> 00:10:34,260
pray and all of these,
this is a really, you know,

174
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:38,510
the sound is a really ecologically
rich medium underwater.

175
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:41,100
And being able to detect those
cues has been really critical.

176
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:45,990
Trying to figure out how to mitigate
that gets to working on quiet or

177
00:10:45,991 --> 00:10:47,180
technologies,
you know,

178
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,910
working at the scale that's relevant
to chronic influence of noise and the

179
00:10:50,911 --> 00:10:54,800
buildup of these industries.
And so we work, um, uh,

180
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:57,840
we've been working a lot at the
international maritime organization,

181
00:10:57,841 --> 00:10:59,400
which is a part of the UN,

182
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:04,430
which regulates worldwide commercial
shipping and got them to pass at the first

183
00:11:04,651 --> 00:11:07,560
voluntary guidelines for
quiet and commercial vessels,

184
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:11,460
things that come or that the countries
that are party to the UN and that are

185
00:11:11,461 --> 00:11:12,840
party to this.
Um,

186
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:16,980
these guidelines can begin to
figure out ways to put in place.

187
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:21,420
And that's one of the first ways you
bring an environmental stressor issue into

188
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:23,700
that,
that global business.

189
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:27,120
And we're working on those same types of
issues with air gun industry, you know,

190
00:11:27,121 --> 00:11:31,290
with the oil and gas industry and with
the possibility of bringing vibroseis

191
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:35,940
into commercial, a widespread commercial
use. And so these are, those are the,

192
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:39,090
some of the things we have to
get at for chronic influence.

193
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:43,320
So was anybody designing more efficient,

194
00:11:43,321 --> 00:11:45,720
quieter ship propellers
for the commercial traffic?

195
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:51,500
Uh, yes. I mean that the efficiency of a,

196
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:55,840
of a commercial propeller has something
that the shipping industry in a lot of

197
00:11:55,841 --> 00:11:58,720
our meetings has said we'd,
you know, we've been working
on this for a long time.

198
00:11:58,721 --> 00:12:01,810
It's not like we haven't been trying
to build commercial propellers,

199
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:06,970
but the pressures on the industry now
are greater than they have ever been.

200
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:08,950
Um, because, um,

201
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:13,290
the sh the global shipping industry
has to come into compliance for carbon

202
00:12:13,291 --> 00:12:17,020
missions at a level that
they never have had to. Um,

203
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,480
and within the next five
to 10 years spectrum,

204
00:12:19,481 --> 00:12:23,650
they have different milestones they have
to reach. That's the biggest design,

205
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:27,640
um, of design pressure
that's been on the, uh,

206
00:12:27,641 --> 00:12:30,340
on new builds for 50 years,

207
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:34,450
other than maybe twin
hulled to reduce, um, uh,

208
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:38,740
issues with ballast and
an end. Um, um, uh, uh,

209
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:42,880
exotic, uh, you know, the
introduction of invasive species.

210
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:47,650
That was another huge design moment for
shipping. So the question now for us,

211
00:12:47,651 --> 00:12:52,630
it's going to be how much of a noise gain
do we get from that pressure that this

212
00:12:52,631 --> 00:12:56,050
greening moment in, um,
carbon emission design.

213
00:12:56,290 --> 00:12:59,860
And that's been the biggest
pressure on what's a model basins,

214
00:12:59,861 --> 00:13:04,861
which is where conglomerates
of shipping mostly in Korea,

215
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:09,160
Japan, I'm a little, you know the
a relatively large one that we,

216
00:13:09,161 --> 00:13:11,980
that was spoken about a little
bit in Germany, but there are,

217
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:15,940
that's where most of that design
work has been and it's usually on the

218
00:13:15,941 --> 00:13:20,920
combination of the hall and the propeller
and then there it always has to do

219
00:13:20,921 --> 00:13:25,150
with operations, so it's this, it's
just this triple linked thing. It's,

220
00:13:25,151 --> 00:13:29,770
it's the propeller design linked to
how the hall is built in, in, in,

221
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:34,860
in combination with a propeller design
and then the third component of is it

222
00:13:35,021 --> 00:13:39,940
actually going to be used to the
design specs that will result in the

223
00:13:39,941 --> 00:13:41,740
efficiencies that that it was built

224
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:42,603
for.

225
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:47,180
But I thought the issue
with propeller design,

226
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:52,130
you've got the efficiency and this quiet
at the same time as the cavitation.

227
00:13:52,131 --> 00:13:56,180
That's the problem that costs us a noise
and causes a loss of efficiency of the

228
00:13:56,181 --> 00:13:57,014
propeller.

229
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:58,531
It's interesting,

230
00:13:58,531 --> 00:14:02,010
I have to tell you that there would be
other voices up here who would be from

231
00:14:02,011 --> 00:14:04,320
the industry who will be saying
it's nowhere near that simple.

232
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:09,700
There's whole sectors of shipping
and PR and propeller use. Um,

233
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:14,040
they have to do with which engine is where
power is paired with which propeller.

234
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:14,850
Um,

235
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:19,850
that would say that it's not a
direct linear relationship and um,

236
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:22,470
that it has to do with a variable.

237
00:14:22,471 --> 00:14:25,800
There's a kind of propeller called
variable speed propellors that are in some

238
00:14:25,801 --> 00:14:28,710
kind of use and you know, so, uh, it,

239
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:31,830
it's just not a completely direct
relationship. Others say that.

240
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:33,600
Overarchingly and I think that's,

241
00:14:33,601 --> 00:14:35,910
some of the statements that
are in the film I think are,

242
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:40,560
they're hard won over several conferences
to get to a place where we feel

243
00:14:40,561 --> 00:14:44,790
comfortable saying, yeah, but there's a
big wind there that's still potential for,

244
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:50,430
um, that said and understanding how to
match that with where we want to be.

245
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:54,770
Um, you know, ships have
an 40 to 50 year lifetime.

246
00:14:55,250 --> 00:15:00,250
So we have to figure out how to deal with
existing vessels and retrofits are not

247
00:15:00,711 --> 00:15:02,390
going to be possible at the design level.

248
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:05,210
And so we're going to have to
build better ships. You absolutely.

249
00:15:05,211 --> 00:15:05,931
And there's that.

250
00:15:05,931 --> 00:15:09,530
That build is probably going
to be pressured not only
by noise if we're lucky,

251
00:15:09,531 --> 00:15:14,300
but by the sort of green ship of tomorrow
holistic design package that gets at

252
00:15:14,301 --> 00:15:17,570
the regulatory pressures that
are coming down the pike.

253
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:22,490
And then we have to figure out how to
operate the ships we have now is mostly

254
00:15:22,491 --> 00:15:25,040
what it's going to be to get
their noise profile down.

255
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:32,100
Let me ask you about the other two main
sources that the film talked about.

256
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:36,580
Uh, one is oil and gas
exploration. So what is the,

257
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,120
what kind of progress,
if any, is there in, uh,

258
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:43,510
oil companies and gas companies adopting,
uh,

259
00:15:43,511 --> 00:15:48,370
these lower frequency or less
invasive, um, exploration technologies,

260
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:52,330
number one,
and number two is the navy and sonar.

261
00:15:52,331 --> 00:15:54,970
I would imagine that,
um,

262
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,990
where the navy is going to be going
in the future with sonar and related

263
00:15:58,991 --> 00:16:02,320
technologies is probably
highly classified. Uh,

264
00:16:02,321 --> 00:16:07,321
but do you have any information on or
have you been heard anything from the navy

265
00:16:07,511 --> 00:16:11,530
or from other countries, navies about, um,

266
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:16,560
the possibility of adopting technologies
in the future that are less damaging

267
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:23,620
in the oil and gas community?
There had been sectors, um,

268
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:27,660
uh, well the major, the
major oil and gas, um,

269
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:30,280
worldwide companies had been investing,

270
00:16:30,281 --> 00:16:34,390
had been the prime investors since
the 70s in some of these alternative

271
00:16:34,391 --> 00:16:39,150
technologies like marine vibroseis.
So they're not a new phenomenon. Um,

272
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:41,910
there,
um,

273
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:46,370
and that investment has indeed
been from the industry. Um,

274
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:51,010
the implementation of that is
this constant dance between,

275
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:56,110
um, it takes millions of dollars to outfit
a geological and geophysical surveying

276
00:16:56,111 --> 00:16:56,944
vessel.

277
00:16:56,980 --> 00:17:00,760
And the fleet that's out
there now therefore has an
enormous amount invested in

278
00:17:00,761 --> 00:17:05,040
the current technology and the areas
of air guns that are being used. Um,

279
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:08,150
so figuring out, um, and the, the,

280
00:17:08,151 --> 00:17:12,910
the bureau of Ocean Energy Management,
which a part of the,

281
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:17,510
uh, department of the interior
and that directly regulates, um,

282
00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:22,450
geophysical exploration. And then
subsequent oil and gas development. Um,

283
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:27,220
Noah works in very close
partnership with, um, that bureau.

284
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:30,490
Um,
our job is usually to help that bureau.

285
00:17:30,491 --> 00:17:34,900
It has its own mandates to figure out
environmental oversight and has its own

286
00:17:34,901 --> 00:17:39,310
mechanisms by which it could incentivize
the development of those technologies.

287
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,690
And we don't have that direct line.
And Noah,

288
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:48,080
our job is to evaluate
the impacts and to um,

289
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,920
authorize,
um,

290
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:53,760
a level of impact if we can find it
to be negligible on some populations.

291
00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:55,950
So that assessment,

292
00:17:55,951 --> 00:18:00,951
we have a lot co-invested
in the assessment realm
and we absolutely have been

293
00:18:01,231 --> 00:18:04,650
part of governmental. Uh, there's a,

294
00:18:04,651 --> 00:18:07,280
an industry I'd called the joint industry,
uh,

295
00:18:07,370 --> 00:18:12,370
Prom Joint Mr program that has developed
an entire marine vibroseis s three

296
00:18:13,321 --> 00:18:16,710
stage, heavily invested
by Exxon Shell, BP,

297
00:18:16,711 --> 00:18:21,300
all of the companies program to,
to try to see if they can get to,

298
00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:22,440
um,

299
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:26,760
vibroseis in use in context and
really do a proof of concept.

300
00:18:26,761 --> 00:18:28,320
All the way from the build.

301
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:31,890
So they have three companies who went
in to show them that they had these

302
00:18:31,891 --> 00:18:36,600
mechanisms and they're taking them through
the various stages of real industrial

303
00:18:36,601 --> 00:18:37,434
development.

304
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:41,130
What I hear from industry is that as
there's never going to be a complete

305
00:18:41,131 --> 00:18:44,820
replacement, but that's the way
they talk about it right now. Um,

306
00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:49,910
but that there will be conditions under
which we could see a lot more use of

307
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:50,913
vibroseis.

308
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:55,200
So I think we're definitely in a slower,

309
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:59,460
slower or in a different place.
We're in a, uh, an um, uh, we're,

310
00:18:59,461 --> 00:19:02,970
we're walking forward. Um, and you
know, sometimes it's a little bit,

311
00:19:02,971 --> 00:19:03,870
two steps forward,

312
00:19:03,871 --> 00:19:08,070
three steps back because the oil and gas
industry goes through its own economic

313
00:19:08,071 --> 00:19:12,360
stages in which it's more progressive
and feels like it has more resources to

314
00:19:12,361 --> 00:19:17,160
fund the next stage. And this is not
that time, oil and gas industry. So,

315
00:19:17,161 --> 00:19:20,340
you know, these things
go in ebbs and flows. Um,

316
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:23,170
the u s navy, um, I'm, uh,

317
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:28,080
I'm not as privy to what
a future technology or
replacement would be for sonar.

318
00:19:28,081 --> 00:19:33,000
And, um, that's not something I can
speak to. Um, but there has been,

319
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:35,490
um,
a lot of work,

320
00:19:35,491 --> 00:19:40,491
very close work between Noaa and the
navy to develop mitigation programs over

321
00:19:41,701 --> 00:19:45,300
time and space. And, um, I think
I'll leave it there for now.

322
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:49,010
I can speak just to the last
little bit with the navy.

323
00:19:49,011 --> 00:19:52,520
And it is definitely true that there's a,
um,

324
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:58,390
there's a lot more focus on the navy
to really comply with standards.

325
00:20:00,171 --> 00:20:03,120
They have to have their permits in
order now and they have to have, um,

326
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:06,560
impact statements ready to go
and have evaluated the impact.

327
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:10,880
And in that there are mitigation measures
built in when they're doing exercises.

328
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:13,430
The other piece of that is,
um,

329
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,310
Noah is the,

330
00:20:16,670 --> 00:20:19,910
the permitting agency for all of the
stranding that works around the United

331
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:19,911
States.

332
00:20:19,911 --> 00:20:24,911
And so I'm working through Noah and
in conjunction with the navy and being

333
00:20:25,221 --> 00:20:30,221
prepared with protocols and knowing when
exercises might be going on in certain

334
00:20:30,471 --> 00:20:34,070
areas so that we can be prepared to,
um,

335
00:20:34,490 --> 00:20:38,390
to deal with the strandings but also to
document what might be happening and it

336
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:41,450
can trigger a shutdown of what they're
doing depending on what comes up.

337
00:20:41,451 --> 00:20:43,010
So at least there's a
lot more communication,

338
00:20:43,011 --> 00:20:46,070
which I think is a huge
step forward as well. Um,

339
00:20:46,071 --> 00:20:48,100
I've been an environmentally concerned

340
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:52,480
citizens since I was this high and I
had no idea about the issues with sonic

341
00:20:52,481 --> 00:20:53,440
pollution in the sea.

342
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:58,620
So I think maybe the most important
way the public can affect the outcomes

343
00:20:58,811 --> 00:21:02,980
positively for the marine mammals and
other animals is to just know about it.

344
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:07,000
So, uh, how can we help
promote this message?

345
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:09,450
And once it is more,
um,

346
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:12,910
I guess known about what can
the public do to affect this?

347
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:19,180
It's really great
questions. Um, and uh, it's,

348
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:20,710
it's interesting, you know, the, um,

349
00:21:20,770 --> 00:21:24,370
before this movie was made and this
movie is not going to obviously save,

350
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:27,340
save the world, right? It's
not going to be the end of the,

351
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:31,820
and really an important need
for outreach, but it has, um,

352
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:35,980
promoted a lot more dialogue. You
know, we, just to give an example,

353
00:21:35,981 --> 00:21:40,300
we recently put out a document that was
really Noah kind of talking to itself

354
00:21:40,301 --> 00:21:41,890
about how to do this work better.

355
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:44,650
So we decided not to really
do a press release about it,

356
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:47,350
but we really did want the
public to know we were doing it.

357
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:52,420
We got over a hundred thousand comments
back on the document and it was covered

358
00:21:52,421 --> 00:21:55,960
on, you know, in the front second
page of the Washington Post.

359
00:21:56,650 --> 00:22:01,650
So that would not have happened without
this movie happening over this past

360
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:06,520
year. And without a lot of
concurrent, um, outreach perspectives.

361
00:22:06,521 --> 00:22:11,290
I actually am somebody who
has worked on Naval Sonar, um,

362
00:22:11,410 --> 00:22:15,460
uh, assessment issues in,
in, in, uh, some past phases.

363
00:22:15,461 --> 00:22:19,960
And I've been concerned with the
disproportionate attention to enable sonar

364
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:25,260
relative to a lot of other sources of
underwater noise that I feel are having

365
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:29,760
really strong effects and that we are
less prepared and have less of a history

366
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:33,270
with developing mitigation
and developing dialogues with,

367
00:22:33,271 --> 00:22:36,550
with specific industries. So I've, um,

368
00:22:37,150 --> 00:22:41,580
I that has, that has been the largest, uh,

369
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:44,980
outreach. Um, and the largest messaging,

370
00:22:44,981 --> 00:22:49,780
the most pervasive outreach and messaging
around ocean noise issues has been

371
00:22:49,781 --> 00:22:54,280
around a court cases
and navy sonar. And, um,

372
00:22:55,070 --> 00:22:58,390
I have been pleased to see that even
some of the same groups that had been

373
00:22:58,391 --> 00:23:02,380
carrying that message for so long are
part of now making a film that is saying

374
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:06,160
this is actually not an
issue about navy sonar.

375
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,840
It's much more holistic than that.

376
00:23:08,290 --> 00:23:13,290
It's much more deeply ingrained in the
way that animals use this environment and

377
00:23:13,301 --> 00:23:16,880
the, you know, many sources of sound
that can contribute to it. So it,

378
00:23:16,890 --> 00:23:21,890
it's been a combination to me of figuring
out how to tell a a story about sub

379
00:23:23,621 --> 00:23:27,010
lethal impacts under of
any nature is tricky.

380
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,950
Having worked with CBS News and
having them come to me and say,

381
00:23:29,951 --> 00:23:33,990
but the shipping noise thing isn't
it killing them? And you, you know,

382
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,840
you know that he really wants you to
say yes because that's the story and the

383
00:23:37,841 --> 00:23:41,110
answer is no, it's making it
really hard to be out there,

384
00:23:41,111 --> 00:23:45,290
but you sure it's not killing them.
Yep. I think it's, you know, so again,

385
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:50,270
we have to tell a complicated story
and, um, and we have to keep telling it.

386
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:54,710
Um, I think what we've said
to people is that they're,

387
00:23:54,770 --> 00:23:58,060
so at Noah where we have a lot of
different outreach perspectives.

388
00:23:58,070 --> 00:24:00,800
We have 14 sites that were um,
our,

389
00:24:00,801 --> 00:24:03,650
our version of national parks off shore,
um,

390
00:24:03,651 --> 00:24:08,120
that are these national
marine sanctuaries. There are
good storytelling media. Um,

391
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:13,140
and we have very large local
constituencies that are
often very engaged in these

392
00:24:13,161 --> 00:24:15,710
places off shore that are
there. And Marian, you know,

393
00:24:15,770 --> 00:24:19,430
your and our national marine sanctuaries.
Um,

394
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:23,030
we've started to increasingly engaged
them and telling the ocean noise story

395
00:24:23,050 --> 00:24:26,240
where you started to increasingly engage
them and putting recorders there and

396
00:24:26,241 --> 00:24:30,650
having live streaming of sound from these
places so that people can start to get

397
00:24:30,651 --> 00:24:32,780
at this sensory medium that is this place.

398
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:37,940
And we're often asked the
question what can I do? And um,

399
00:24:38,090 --> 00:24:41,390
it is a tricky one. It is. I
think being educated about it,

400
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:46,420
understanding it as part of the balancing
act we do surrounding how we move

401
00:24:47,121 --> 00:24:52,050
goods around surrounding. And how
you, how you as a purchaser, um,

402
00:24:52,130 --> 00:24:56,930
can consider this as part of global
transiting of stuff that yeah, I'm,

403
00:24:56,931 --> 00:25:00,980
that we all buy that is something
that we've talked about. Um,

404
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:02,900
and um,

405
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:07,700
other than that is part of very large
decisions about energy offshore energy

406
00:25:07,701 --> 00:25:11,780
development that we can
do, um, smartly we can,

407
00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:13,910
that we can do in, in the, uh,

408
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:17,750
with pressures to do it very intelligently
and thinking a lot about marine life.

409
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:22,100
Um,
I think that those are the ways that we,

410
00:25:22,101 --> 00:25:26,510
the messages that we've started to
develop the most and make them place based

411
00:25:26,511 --> 00:25:30,020
where people can start to
attach themselves to them
because people are often

412
00:25:30,021 --> 00:25:34,280
very attached to particular ocean
more than they are the ocean.

413
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:39,660
I think from a nonprofit perspective,
we do,

414
00:25:41,010 --> 00:25:45,210
part of what we do with all of the
different issues that we face is trying to

415
00:25:45,211 --> 00:25:48,780
get the public aware of it and giving
out the right information and making sure

416
00:25:48,781 --> 00:25:53,040
good science is out there to inform
really good policy development.

417
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:54,353
Um,

418
00:25:55,230 --> 00:25:58,770
I had a really interesting conversation
last night with someone who was talking

419
00:25:58,771 --> 00:26:00,060
about the fact that the,

420
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:05,960
the size testing that was going on in
Madagascar prior to that stranding was a

421
00:26:06,571 --> 00:26:10,590
multibeam echo sounder, which is kind of
like what you'd see on anybody's boat.

422
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:12,000
I mean it was industrial sized one,

423
00:26:12,001 --> 00:26:16,710
but it was like what you'd use as a fish
finder or depth finder on your personal

424
00:26:16,711 --> 00:26:17,251
watercraft.

425
00:26:17,251 --> 00:26:20,220
So when you start thinking
about the number of vessels
that are on the water and

426
00:26:20,221 --> 00:26:22,830
how many people have these as
part of what's out there now,

427
00:26:22,831 --> 00:26:25,980
granted that's a very small
scale and not very strong. Um,

428
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:30,330
but I think an awareness of, of
everything we're doing, you think back to,

429
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:32,630
you know,
seventies and eighties and the,

430
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:34,800
the ads about not littering
and things like that,

431
00:26:34,801 --> 00:26:36,660
that was kind of this
revolutionary movement.

432
00:26:36,870 --> 00:26:39,360
It's a similar kind of thing and
awareness of the impact that we have as

433
00:26:39,361 --> 00:26:42,810
individuals. And then I think
looking for those opportunities,

434
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:45,780
we get to the point,
you know,

435
00:26:45,781 --> 00:26:50,050
certainly at a national level and
looking at legislation that can help, um,

436
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:53,120
regulate this in a meaningful way that,

437
00:26:53,130 --> 00:26:55,260
that supports the kind of
work we all have to do.

438
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:58,050
Whether it's national security
or having the goods that we need,

439
00:26:58,051 --> 00:27:01,920
but also protects the
environment. Um, you know,

440
00:27:01,921 --> 00:27:04,410
and then looking at it and
finding ways to support that.

441
00:27:04,411 --> 00:27:06,330
But also we have to
think on a global scale.

442
00:27:06,331 --> 00:27:10,800
And that's where it gets really difficult
for me is processing noise on a global

443
00:27:10,801 --> 00:27:11,634
scale.

444
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:17,230
So, um, I had, uh,

445
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:22,260
written professor Christopher Clark with
a question and he actually wrote back

446
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:24,610
during the movie.
So I just read his response,

447
00:27:24,611 --> 00:27:27,490
but I want to ask you to the
same question and first style.

448
00:27:27,491 --> 00:27:28,540
I'll read his response.

449
00:27:28,810 --> 00:27:33,810
I wondered about the role of citizen
science and he wrote for Marine Acoustics,

450
00:27:35,410 --> 00:27:39,160
we're still in the embryonic stage.
The number of people recording in the,

451
00:27:39,161 --> 00:27:41,380
in the ocean has increased dramatically.

452
00:27:41,770 --> 00:27:46,770
And the challenge is not data collection
so much as it is data processing.

453
00:27:47,770 --> 00:27:48,640
For example,

454
00:27:48,670 --> 00:27:52,450
the bioacoustics research lab norm
routinely collects the equivalent of

455
00:27:52,451 --> 00:27:57,451
somewhere around 120 280 years of
raw acoustic data every 12 months.

456
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:03,400
And we have to search through all of
those using various auto detection

457
00:28:03,401 --> 00:28:07,990
algorithms, most recently on
high performance computers.
And there's lots of tech,

458
00:28:07,991 --> 00:28:10,060
no discussions that
could follow on this one.

459
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:14,290
So I wish he were here to tell us
more about that. Um, but he says it's,

460
00:28:14,291 --> 00:28:18,910
it's like where's Waldo and needles
in haystacks within haystacks.

461
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:23,740
Ah, but I wonder what a, you two
could say, not just in acoustics,

462
00:28:23,741 --> 00:28:26,690
but in general about the role of
citizen science in any of these.

463
00:28:27,650 --> 00:28:30,400
Hmm, sure. Um,

464
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:35,410
vital in many respects would
be my answer to that. Um,

465
00:28:36,430 --> 00:28:39,370
we at the international front in front,

466
00:28:39,371 --> 00:28:42,730
I'm a welfare and most stranding networks
around the country and around the

467
00:28:42,731 --> 00:28:45,310
globe for that matter,
rely on volunteers.

468
00:28:45,370 --> 00:28:48,700
So the general public to come in and
it's not just a matter of come in,

469
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,860
pick up a dolphin,
help us get it back in the water.

470
00:28:50,861 --> 00:28:54,520
It's come in and help us collect data,
help us pull it together.

471
00:28:54,521 --> 00:28:56,200
And trying to utilize,

472
00:28:56,350 --> 00:28:59,530
a lot of times we have people that have
retired from incredible careers that

473
00:28:59,531 --> 00:29:01,860
have this skill set that
they can bring to us, um,

474
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:05,830
and really give us some additional
benefit that we wouldn't necessarily have

475
00:29:05,831 --> 00:29:10,570
expected. I think that the other,
the other piece of citizen science,

476
00:29:10,571 --> 00:29:12,850
you can see there's different
programs around the world.

477
00:29:12,851 --> 00:29:16,720
I know of one in Australia where
they're looking at a lot of oil and gas

478
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:20,220
exploration and development
and there's not that,

479
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:25,030
some really remote places along the
coastline and they actually set up a great

480
00:29:25,031 --> 00:29:29,240
program. I'm part of it was through
Duke University in getting, um,

481
00:29:29,290 --> 00:29:32,710
boaters and coastal folks to report
sightings and take photographs.

482
00:29:32,711 --> 00:29:36,040
I had this great app that they had and
you could take a picture and send it in.

483
00:29:36,041 --> 00:29:38,310
And so they were tracking,
um,

484
00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:40,960
presence and absence of different
species of marine mammals,

485
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:45,220
the coast to try and develop a data
set that didn't really exist. Um,

486
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:47,290
and it's a much less
expensive way to do that.

487
00:29:47,291 --> 00:29:51,410
Then trying to get a survey vessel out
there with paid observers and all the

488
00:29:51,411 --> 00:29:53,830
things that you need to do that
which still needs to be done.

489
00:29:53,831 --> 00:29:57,340
But this gives that, um, an added
layer of data they can come into it.

490
00:29:57,341 --> 00:29:59,950
So I think there's a huge role
and I think as we go forward,

491
00:30:00,370 --> 00:30:04,660
a more informed population gives us the
opportunity to engage more people with

492
00:30:04,661 --> 00:30:06,310
an interest to do more of that work.

493
00:30:10,610 --> 00:30:12,980
No, I think I, uh, I think
that covers a lot. I mean,

494
00:30:12,981 --> 00:30:16,310
the other citizen science programs I was
thinking of were very similar in terms

495
00:30:16,311 --> 00:30:20,570
of integrating, um,
integrating citing information.

496
00:30:20,630 --> 00:30:23,330
Then those have been powerful.
And you, the, the base,

497
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:26,210
the basis of mitigation development
is knowing where animals are.

498
00:30:26,211 --> 00:30:30,620
And it's a huge, huge,
huge task to describe,

499
00:30:30,621 --> 00:30:35,090
well how animals use the environment in
a way that you can then prevent overlap.

500
00:30:35,450 --> 00:30:38,750
And it's the most powerful way
we have of reducing influence.

501
00:30:38,751 --> 00:30:43,490
So getting citizens engaged in that
effort is, is really, um, has it,

502
00:30:43,491 --> 00:30:44,420
has a lot of potential.

503
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:45,800
Okay.

504
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:49,610
And I personally also have a more
Katie more oriented question,

505
00:30:49,910 --> 00:30:54,110
which is that I'm very curious about
the incidence response that you do.

506
00:30:54,111 --> 00:30:57,710
Like how do you hear about something?
How do you organize a response?

507
00:30:57,711 --> 00:31:00,650
What's it like to go there?
What is the follow up?

508
00:31:02,010 --> 00:31:05,760
Well, local responses
easy comparatively. Um,

509
00:31:06,570 --> 00:31:08,970
thankfully,
um,

510
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:13,710
folks on Cape Cod and in the areas that
we respond a really keenly aware of

511
00:31:13,711 --> 00:31:16,350
what's supposed to be happening in the
water in front of their house or on the

512
00:31:16,351 --> 00:31:18,180
beach in front of the house
and what's out of the ordinary.

513
00:31:18,181 --> 00:31:21,810
And so we get a lot of reports,
early morning beach walkers,

514
00:31:22,050 --> 00:31:25,860
things like that of when a seal or a
dolphin or whale might be either swimming

515
00:31:25,861 --> 00:31:26,581
close to shore,

516
00:31:26,581 --> 00:31:31,581
out of habitat or up on the beach stranded
when it comes to responding outside

517
00:31:32,251 --> 00:31:37,050
of our normal like response area here on
the Cape, it's a lot more challenging.

518
00:31:37,051 --> 00:31:39,000
When we got the call from Madagascar,

519
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:43,020
it just so happened that this stranding
took place during a meeting of the

520
00:31:43,021 --> 00:31:44,830
international whaling commission so big.

521
00:31:44,831 --> 00:31:48,420
So basically every big whale biologist
on the planet was concentrated in

522
00:31:48,421 --> 00:31:53,100
Santiago, Chile, and they sent out a
plea for help do a handful of folks.

523
00:31:53,130 --> 00:31:54,480
And um,

524
00:31:55,050 --> 00:31:58,950
within 20 hours we were
on a plane on our way.

525
00:31:58,951 --> 00:32:03,951
We met our colleagues that we had never
met before on an Air France flight going

526
00:32:04,411 --> 00:32:07,710
from Paris into Madagascar. And, um,

527
00:32:08,430 --> 00:32:12,690
it's a really difficult, difficult thing
to do to respond in real time globally.

528
00:32:12,810 --> 00:32:16,800
Um, you know, the animals that we see,

529
00:32:16,830 --> 00:32:18,270
the less time they spend out of the water,

530
00:32:18,271 --> 00:32:21,540
the better when you're talking about
a dolphin or a whale. And so our,

531
00:32:21,541 --> 00:32:25,560
one of the keys to our success here on
the Cape is how fast we can get there and

532
00:32:25,561 --> 00:32:28,920
how quickly our local volunteers that
are trained can get there before us if

533
00:32:28,921 --> 00:32:30,870
it's in their backyard.
Um,

534
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:34,560
when I first started out
with mass stranded animals,

535
00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:37,740
if we got to them and they were
still alive when we got there,

536
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:41,370
they had about a 14 chance of surviving.
Um,

537
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:45,980
and now we're upwards of 80%. Um,
just because of the techniques.

538
00:32:45,981 --> 00:32:47,840
We have lots of experience volunteers,

539
00:32:47,841 --> 00:32:51,710
we've learned a lot over the years in
terms of how to treat the animals, um,

540
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:54,430
both from supportive care and medically.
Um,

541
00:32:54,530 --> 00:32:57,800
we don't have that advantage when we're
talking about flying around the world

542
00:32:57,801 --> 00:32:59,240
and taking two days to get there.

543
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:03,930
So we're limited in the kinds of responses
we can do. But basically we'll get,

544
00:33:04,030 --> 00:33:07,850
there will be a call out from,
you know,

545
00:33:07,851 --> 00:33:10,940
it can be another nonprofit or
a government looking for help.

546
00:33:11,150 --> 00:33:15,560
I think one of the best things that we
have going for us is how small the world

547
00:33:15,561 --> 00:33:18,440
has become because of the way we can
easily communicate with one another.

548
00:33:18,441 --> 00:33:22,850
So information is shared so rapidly that
they can call out for help and you can

549
00:33:22,851 --> 00:33:26,420
get folks, um, on the road
or at least informing.

550
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:30,410
We share a lot of information online
and over the phone to try and get teams

551
00:33:30,411 --> 00:33:33,260
locally, um, able to respond in.

552
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:37,370
One of our projects we're working on
now actually with Noaa and the Marine

553
00:33:37,370 --> 00:33:41,210
Mammal Center in Sausalito is, um, an
international stranding response tool kit.

554
00:33:41,390 --> 00:33:45,930
So basically it would be all the
resources you need from what,

555
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:47,030
what,

556
00:33:47,030 --> 00:33:50,630
figuring out what legislation you have
in your country to what permits you need,

557
00:33:50,631 --> 00:33:54,050
who your partner should be, how do you get
funded, how do you recruit a volunteer,

558
00:33:54,051 --> 00:33:58,910
how do you get trained, um, and what are
all the protocols you need from a to z.

559
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:02,720
Um, and the goal would be to have, um,

560
00:34:03,230 --> 00:34:06,350
folks around the globe that we know are
kind of already qualified in all of this.

561
00:34:06,351 --> 00:34:10,220
They're already helping us develop it
internationally and then have them be the

562
00:34:10,221 --> 00:34:12,350
initial trainers.
But the goal is to train the trainers.

563
00:34:12,351 --> 00:34:13,790
So we're training people on the ground,

564
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:16,760
then develop networks in their areas
and share what they know with their

565
00:34:16,761 --> 00:34:17,540
neighbors.

566
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:21,440
So would just continued to grow on its
own and be this free resource that would

567
00:34:21,441 --> 00:34:25,100
help kind of solve some of these emergent
problems or you have to be really,

568
00:34:25,101 --> 00:34:28,820
really quick and response. So that's,
I think the longterm solution is there.

569
00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:33,800
Thank you for, um, uh, providing
the opportunity costs for,

570
00:34:33,801 --> 00:34:37,340
for showing the film
here and, um, for, uh,

571
00:34:37,350 --> 00:34:42,090
becoming informed about this
issue. And, um, I could make a,

572
00:34:42,190 --> 00:34:46,860
um, uh, uh, give a shout out to, um,

573
00:34:47,070 --> 00:34:50,760
some of the things that are
happening from Noah this summer. Um,

574
00:34:50,790 --> 00:34:53,010
we are,
um,

575
00:34:53,310 --> 00:34:57,720
working on releasing are a final copy of
this 10 year vision for how the agency

576
00:34:57,721 --> 00:35:02,520
is, um, uh, looking to improve
the way we address ocean noise.

577
00:35:02,521 --> 00:35:07,521
And that's at a website called set
sound.noaa.gov and there's a lot of

578
00:35:08,251 --> 00:35:11,400
information there about what we do and um,

579
00:35:11,550 --> 00:35:15,720
the draft that we put out that got
a lot of public comment and um,

580
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:19,860
feel free to reach out to us and there's
our information is all in that site.

581
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:23,000
I would say thank you as well.

582
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:26,900
This was a great chance to come and
share a little bit of what we do. Um,

583
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:31,700
and I guess my request would be share
what you've learned and share your

584
00:35:31,701 --> 00:35:34,780
enthusiasm. I think that
goes a long way. Um,

585
00:35:35,210 --> 00:35:37,800
if you're really interested in marine
mammals and doing some volunteer work and

586
00:35:37,801 --> 00:35:41,280
doing an aquarium has a fantastic
stranding response program as well,

587
00:35:41,281 --> 00:35:45,570
and sea turtles as well for them. Um,
and we do down on the Cape as well.

588
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:49,440
So everybody's always looking for a
volunteer. So if you're willing and able

589
00:35:50,350 --> 00:35:55,020
[inaudible].
