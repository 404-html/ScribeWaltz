1
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:11,570
Scott,
welcome to Google coming in.

2
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:17,150
Perhaps you could tell us what got you
interested in space. Well, first of all,

3
00:00:17,151 --> 00:00:21,200
I'd like to say it's great to be here.
So great to be anywhere with gravity

4
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:26,660
because now I can sit down.
Can't do that in space.

5
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:28,730
It's one of the space station.

6
00:00:28,731 --> 00:00:31,910
I changed position so many times you
would have thought I was running for

7
00:00:31,911 --> 00:00:36,020
president.
Maybe I should have.

8
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:41,420
So to those of you in the audience that
do not appear to be space alien aliens,

9
00:00:41,421 --> 00:00:46,421
I'd like to say good afternoon until
the rest of you might come in peace.

10
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:52,070
What I'd like to do first before I talk
about like what got me interested in

11
00:00:52,071 --> 00:00:56,300
becoming an astronaut, I want to read
from the book but a little bit because uh,

12
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:59,690
you can hear it in my own voice and then
you don't have to go out and buy the

13
00:00:59,691 --> 00:01:02,390
audio book.
I know these are expensive.

14
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:07,220
Let's start at the beginning of the story.

15
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:10,670
It's only gonna take about five minutes
and starting the beginning of the story

16
00:01:10,671 --> 00:01:11,390
and uh,

17
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:16,390
it's really sort of the end of the story
cause I got home and this is about 48

18
00:01:18,231 --> 00:01:21,620
hours after I got back after being on
the space station for an entire year.

19
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:25,390
I'm sitting at the head of my dining
room table at home in Houston,

20
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,870
finishing dinner with my family.

21
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:32,150
My longtime girlfriend Ameco now my
fiance in the back of the room and my

22
00:01:32,151 --> 00:01:36,020
daughter is Samantha in Charlotte.
My twin brother Mark, his wife Gabby,

23
00:01:36,021 --> 00:01:40,160
his daughter Claudia,
our father Richie and Amico son Corbin.

24
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:45,200
It's a simple thing sitting at a table
and eating a meal with those you love and

25
00:01:45,201 --> 00:01:48,920
many people do it every day without
giving it much thought. For me,

26
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:51,350
it's something I've been
dreaming of for almost a year.

27
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:55,400
I contemplated what it would be
like to eat this meal so many times.

28
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:59,060
Now that I'm finally here,
it doesn't seem entirely real.

29
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:02,960
The faces of the people I love
that I haven't seen for so long.

30
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:07,580
The chatter of many people talking
together, the clink of silverware,

31
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:12,050
the swish of wine in a glass.
These are all unfamiliar.

32
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:14,210
Even this,

33
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:19,070
the sensation of gravity holding me in
my chair feels strange and every time I

34
00:02:19,071 --> 00:02:20,960
put a glass or a fork down on the table,

35
00:02:20,961 --> 00:02:25,250
there's a part of my mind that is looking
for a dot of velcro or a strip of duct

36
00:02:25,251 --> 00:02:30,140
tape to hold it in place.
I've been back on earth for 48 hours.

37
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:35,360
I pushed back from the table and struggle
to stand up feeling like an old man

38
00:02:35,361 --> 00:02:39,530
getting out of a recliner
stick a fork in me. I'm done.

39
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:43,550
I announced everyone laughs and
encourages me to go get some rest,

40
00:02:43,551 --> 00:02:48,230
so I go to sleep. Then I wake up a few
hours later with flu like symptoms,

41
00:02:48,231 --> 00:02:52,010
not feeling very well at all.
I struggled to get up,

42
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:55,190
find the edge of the bed,
feet down, sit up, stand up.

43
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:58,340
At every stage I feel like I'm
fighting through quicksand.

44
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:03,850
When I'm finally vertical, the pain in
my legs is awful and on top of that pain,

45
00:03:03,851 --> 00:03:05,590
I feel something even more alarming.

46
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:09,040
All the blood in my body
is rushing to my legs.

47
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:13,780
Like the sensation of the blood rushing
to your head when you do a headstand.

48
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:18,580
But in reverse, I can feel the
tissue in my leg. Swelling.

49
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:21,220
I shuffle my way to the bathroom,

50
00:03:21,221 --> 00:03:25,300
moving my weight from one foot to the
other with deliberate effort. Left right,

51
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:28,750
left, right. I make it to the bathroom,

52
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:31,810
flip on the light and
look down at my legs.

53
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:36,130
They were swollen and aliens stumps.
Not Legs at all.

54
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:41,770
There. No kids in here, right? No
kids, no kids work at Google. Not yet.

55
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:46,630
Oh Shit.
I say Ameco come look at this.

56
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:51,100
She kneels down and squeezes one ankle
and it squishes like a water balloon.

57
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:55,570
She looks up at me with worried eyes.
I can't even feel your ankle bones.

58
00:03:55,571 --> 00:04:00,400
She says it was about 400
pages after that. But anyway,

59
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:04,600
so how did I get interested in becoming
an astronaut? I want to be in space.

60
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:08,180
I'm that. Yeah. So you know, I was this a

61
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:14,020
atypical kind of person,
kid that became an astronaut.

62
00:04:14,021 --> 00:04:17,560
Because when I was younger,
I was a really bad student.

63
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:21,790
I didn't do well,
not something I'm proud of.

64
00:04:21,791 --> 00:04:23,890
I spent more time looking out the window,

65
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:27,040
wondering what was going on
outside or looking at the clock,

66
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:31,270
trying to will it to run faster just so
I can get out of the classroom than I

67
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:33,310
ever did.
Paying attention in school.

68
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:39,660
I managed to graduate from high school
in the bottom half of my class and I went

69
00:04:40,391 --> 00:04:44,600
on to college because I was supposed
to go to college. I thought, um,

70
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:46,690
actually went to the wrong school.

71
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:50,500
Now I don't mean I went to this school
thinking this one over here was a better

72
00:04:50,501 --> 00:04:51,334
fit for me.

73
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:56,400
What I mean is I applied to and got
accepted to and showed up here thinking I

74
00:04:58,001 --> 00:04:59,230
was going to this other school,

75
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:03,550
quite possibly the only person
that has ever done this.

76
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:08,380
And I get to my college and I'm there
for a few days and I'm like, Hey,

77
00:05:08,381 --> 00:05:12,460
when's the uh, football
game? And they're like,

78
00:05:12,461 --> 00:05:15,850
we don't have a football team.
That's that other school in Maryland.

79
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:20,440
And I was basically, you know, doing
the same thing I did in high school.

80
00:05:20,441 --> 00:05:24,010
It was impossible for me to pay attention.
I think if I was a kid today,

81
00:05:24,011 --> 00:05:28,330
I'd be the kid with add or Adhd and
maybe I would've gotten a little bit more

82
00:05:28,331 --> 00:05:33,190
help because we know what that is.
I couldn't study, wasn't doing well.

83
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,380
Eventually,
I'm really not even going to class.

84
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:40,990
One day I just happened to be walking
across the school campus and I go into the

85
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:44,800
bookstore, the college bookstore to
buy like gum or something. Not a book,

86
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:48,820
was not a big reader.
I walked into the bookstore.

87
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:53,530
I happened to see this book on the
end of the shelf. It's got this red,

88
00:05:53,531 --> 00:05:58,130
white and blue cover. It's got a
really cool title, made me pick it up,

89
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:03,400
not this book made me pick it up and
looked at the back interested enough and

90
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:07,130
what the bank said that I looked
through it. It took my gum money,

91
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,090
purchase the book,

92
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:13,600
went back and laid on my unmade dorm
room bed for the next three days and read

93
00:06:14,571 --> 00:06:17,960
the stories of the fighter pilots that
became the test pilots that became the

94
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:20,090
original Mercury Gemini
and Apollo astronauts.

95
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:25,820
The book was the right stuff by Tom Wolf.
I think a combination between,

96
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:26,151
you know,

97
00:06:26,151 --> 00:06:31,151
what these guys were doing and how Tom
wrote in this creative nonfiction way

98
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:33,050
just captured my imagination.

99
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:37,160
And I felt like I had a lot
in common with those guys,

100
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:43,120
the early astronauts and test
pilots that became astronauts, uh,

101
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:46,850
with one exception. And that is, I was
a bad student. I couldn't pay attention.

102
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:50,570
And I thought, you know, if I could fix
that one thing, solve that one thing,

103
00:06:50,571 --> 00:06:51,530
maybe I could be like that.

104
00:06:51,531 --> 00:06:54,620
And maybe I could go up and fly airplanes
in the navy, land on an aircraft care.

105
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:59,660
Maybe if I did well at that,
I could become a test pilot later,

106
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:02,780
possibly an astronaut. And then,
oh wait, you're thinking, you know,

107
00:07:02,781 --> 00:07:06,440
18 year old kid reads a book, decides he's
going to become an astronaut. You know,

108
00:07:06,441 --> 00:07:10,400
it's kind of science fiction. It's
a, you know, it's a giant leap.

109
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:13,460
Really what it was. Well, you know,
it started with something very,

110
00:07:13,461 --> 00:07:15,650
very challenging,
very hard,

111
00:07:15,651 --> 00:07:18,380
which was to teach myself how
to pay attention and study.

112
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:23,610
Once I figured that out, it really became
a bunch of very, you know, smaller,

113
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:27,530
manageable steps always with,
you know, opportunities to fail,

114
00:07:27,531 --> 00:07:32,120
but always somehow managing
my way back concourse.

115
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:37,540
And if you consider the that
I read that book at 18, uh,

116
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:39,800
fast forward 18 years later,
I was 36.

117
00:07:39,801 --> 00:07:44,070
I was flying in space for the very first
time as the first American astronaut

118
00:07:44,071 --> 00:07:46,160
and my class of 35 people to fly.

119
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:51,170
That's a pretty remarkable comeback.
That for me is even hard to believe.

120
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:56,920
Thank you. Bye. [inaudible] I know the
whole book is absolutely fascinating. I,

121
00:07:56,980 --> 00:08:01,400
I wanted, um, if you
could talk about suddenly,

122
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:05,510
I know a lot about the international
space station itself and you spent a long

123
00:08:05,511 --> 00:08:09,710
time, you ended Austin. What's
it like living on the ISS?

124
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:15,500
Well, it's a, it, there's a few things
about it that, uh, come to mind, right?

125
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:20,690
It's a fun for one, you
know, you're floating, which,

126
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:25,220
uh, after you getting over the
novelty of it being fun, it's, uh,

127
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:29,450
makes most things harder to do. You
know, there's a few things easier.

128
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:33,410
I always say there's two things easier
to do in zero gravity, moving heavy,

129
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:38,230
heavy objects and um, you know, getting
in the awkward positions like the hookup,

130
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:40,190
the Kodak Schaible on your TV.

131
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:43,490
Much easier when you can
turn upside down or sideways.

132
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:49,010
Actually I said this to a kid last night
and he pointed out a third thing and he

133
00:08:49,011 --> 00:08:53,420
said acrobatics is also easier.
Absolutely right.

134
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:58,730
Everything is harder. Um, because you
can't put anything down. No you're lucid.

135
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:03,450
Even brushing your teeth is hard.
You know, you have the toothpaste,

136
00:09:03,451 --> 00:09:05,520
the toothbrush,
maybe a cap on the

137
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:12,050
toothpaste and then you have nothing to
do with the toothpaste after you brush

138
00:09:13,081 --> 00:09:14,400
your teeth cause there's no sync.

139
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:19,500
You can either spit it out into a tissue
which is uncomfortable in zero gravity

140
00:09:19,501 --> 00:09:22,470
or you can swallow it people
half the people do one thing.

141
00:09:22,471 --> 00:09:27,190
I swallowed my toothpaste for a whole
year, which I don't recommend. Um,

142
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,230
you also have an incredible
view on the space station,

143
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:36,030
but it's a hard place to live and work
when you made me wouldn't be hard for you

144
00:09:36,031 --> 00:09:39,190
guys cause you guys spend
a lot of time at work. Um,

145
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:42,720
but they make it really nice that
you want to spend time at work. Um,

146
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:46,170
but when you go to sleep, you're at
work. When you wake up, you're at work.

147
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,680
You can't go outside, no
son, no wind, no rain,

148
00:09:49,681 --> 00:09:54,540
no freedom of choice to do what you
want to do, when you want to do it.

149
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:58,680
Um, challenging because you're living
in this very risky environment.

150
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:02,730
You always have to be ready for an
emergency even when you're asleep. Um,

151
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:08,430
but it's also this magical place.
It's like living in Disney world.

152
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:11,270
The space station is a very big,
um,

153
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:16,140
a million pounds size of a football pitch,
a,

154
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:20,960
uh, internal volume of a really big house.
So you never feel like closed in. Um,

155
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:22,013
but it's a,

156
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:26,760
it's a privilege to have spent
for me 500 days of my life there.

157
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:31,490
And the last time you went back that
year long study was designed to find out

158
00:10:31,491 --> 00:10:35,360
how people cope in space. So we
wanted to go to Mars. How would,

159
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:37,820
how would humans cut? And, um, you know,

160
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:40,970
what were the lessons that you
brought back from that? What,

161
00:10:40,971 --> 00:10:42,550
what was the science that
we actually found it.

162
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:47,730
So this year long mission,
the idea behind it, you know,

163
00:10:47,731 --> 00:10:48,810
many of you might be aware,

164
00:10:48,811 --> 00:10:52,470
we generally send astronauts
up there for about six months.

165
00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:57,930
It's usually like four to five and a half.
It was how the schedule works.

166
00:10:57,931 --> 00:10:59,400
But um,

167
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:03,480
NASA started talking about sending an
astronaut and cosmonaut to the space

168
00:11:03,481 --> 00:11:05,760
station for a year with the idea of,
you know,

169
00:11:05,761 --> 00:11:08,490
some day we're going to
go to Mars to get to Mars.

170
00:11:08,491 --> 00:11:10,710
It's going to take 200 days to get there.

171
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:14,200
You'll have to spend a year
on the surface. So, you know,

172
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:17,700
you're not in zero gravity, but
essentially you're still kind of in space.

173
00:11:17,701 --> 00:11:19,920
You know, Mara or Mars doesn't
have much of an atmosphere.

174
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:23,190
It's got a third of the gravity of Earth.

175
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:26,940
A lot of radiation is going to
take you 200 days to get home.

176
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:30,330
And there are things that
happened to us in space, um,

177
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:34,290
to our physiology that we need to
understand more about bone loss,

178
00:11:34,291 --> 00:11:36,930
muscle loss affects on our vision
affects on our immune system,

179
00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:39,270
the radiation effects on
us at a genetic level.

180
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:43,980
So we wanted to study this for a longer
period of time and study it while we

181
00:11:43,981 --> 00:11:45,360
have the space station,

182
00:11:45,361 --> 00:11:50,160
which is an incredible facility to do
science before we lose that in the next,

183
00:11:50,161 --> 00:11:53,680
I don't know, six or so years. Um,

184
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:57,640
so the idea behind this year long mission
is to someday go to Mars and there was

185
00:11:57,641 --> 00:12:01,500
also a psych component,
so it was a, excuse me,

186
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,790
me and this Cosmin not up on
the space station for a year.

187
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:09,220
There's also the side study
with my brother and I because
he's an identical twin.

188
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:14,370
NASA has had the data on him since 1995
he's familiar with how things work.

189
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:18,580
He spent some time in
space, um, as well. Eh,

190
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:22,870
he flew four times. He spent 50
days in space. So I would say 50,

191
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:24,610
compared to my 500

192
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:30,990
every chance I can show that there's
competition. No, no competition. All um,

193
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:32,621
yeah.

194
00:12:32,621 --> 00:12:37,360
So the idea behind this genetic study
with my brother and I is to see how the

195
00:12:37,361 --> 00:12:40,840
space environment, the
radiation, the stress,

196
00:12:40,841 --> 00:12:45,070
the micro gravity perhaps affects us
genetically and they have found some

197
00:12:45,071 --> 00:12:49,150
interesting results so far. Right. And
that's a look quite longitudinal study.

198
00:12:49,151 --> 00:12:53,410
I think. Yes, it will go on for the
rest of my life. And uh, you know,

199
00:12:53,411 --> 00:12:56,760
the way Nasa Science
Works is, uh, you know,

200
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:01,800
it's not driven by like investments and
schedules and trying to get results out

201
00:13:03,251 --> 00:13:07,600
because you're in competition
with somebody else. So
generally takes a few years.

202
00:13:07,601 --> 00:13:09,510
So generally from the
time you collected data,

203
00:13:09,511 --> 00:13:12,120
it's like three to five years to a result.
Okay.

204
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:15,830
So you would've got to the ice ass a cool.

205
00:13:15,831 --> 00:13:19,150
So tokens through it probably stacks all
of finding out that you're going to be

206
00:13:19,151 --> 00:13:19,984
on a mission.

207
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:24,790
It was to actually arriving
either facilities or doesn't
see a lot of training.

208
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,520
Yeah. The training that
they would up to. Yeah.

209
00:13:27,521 --> 00:13:32,521
So I became an astronaut in 1996 after
spending time in the navy as a fighter

210
00:13:32,651 --> 00:13:36,700
pilot, flying the f 14 tomcat. Um,

211
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:41,110
and then as a test pilot in the
navy and then I went on to NASA.

212
00:13:41,111 --> 00:13:45,280
Then for the next few years
I'd be basically to get a
phd and the space shuttle,

213
00:13:45,281 --> 00:13:48,700
because it's the most complicated
aerospace vehicle ever built,

214
00:13:49,210 --> 00:13:52,300
2000 switches and circuit breakers inside,
you know,

215
00:13:52,301 --> 00:13:54,810
some of which have you throw a switch
or push a button at the wrong time.

216
00:13:54,811 --> 00:13:58,330
You blow the thing up, you, your
crew members along with you.

217
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:01,540
And uh,
yeah.

218
00:14:01,541 --> 00:14:05,700
So I spent most of my time over the next
three and a half years, just, you know,

219
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:08,020
for this kid that probably had add,
you know,

220
00:14:08,021 --> 00:14:11,080
learning how to fly this most
complicated thing was a challenge.

221
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:15,250
Like worked really hard at it,
happen to get assigned to my first flight.

222
00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:16,390
Not in a traditional way.

223
00:14:16,391 --> 00:14:20,740
You would think you would come into a
large room and somebody would announce

224
00:14:20,741 --> 00:14:23,500
that, uh, hey, you've been
assigned to this mission.

225
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:28,530
Congratulations the way I found out as
the commander of the upcoming mission.

226
00:14:29,141 --> 00:14:33,760
I was going to be on this Hubble Space
Telescope repair mission had me, he said,

227
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:36,250
hey, come in this office,
I need to talk to you.

228
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:38,980
And I had never really
talked to this guy before.

229
00:14:38,981 --> 00:14:42,450
He was this space shuttle
commander kind of, uh, you know,

230
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:47,140
had a little bit of reputation. Um, and
he pokes me in the chest and he goes,

231
00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:50,950
you better have your shit together
because we're flying in space in six.

232
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:56,750
Yes sir.
I'll get my,

233
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:01,070
I kept my shit together right
away and we trained for,

234
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:05,370
we wound up flying nine months later
because of some delays, but you know,

235
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:06,223
pretty soon you're,

236
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:10,700
you've kind of made terms
with your situation, you know,

237
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:13,940
you consider the risks that uh,
you know,

238
00:15:13,941 --> 00:15:16,260
after this last accident we had you,

239
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:21,140
you have a one in 70 chance of dying
on this flight. It was kind of like,

240
00:15:21,141 --> 00:15:22,550
if I took a deck of cards and you know,

241
00:15:22,551 --> 00:15:26,240
left the jokers and all the extra cards
in it, I threw it out in the audience.

242
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:27,440
A couple decks of cards.

243
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:30,320
Everyone that got the ace of
spades didn't go home tonight.

244
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:35,000
And that's how risky it is,
demonstrated risk. And uh,

245
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:39,260
so you think about that leading up to the
your first mission and even subsequent

246
00:15:39,261 --> 00:15:42,350
missions. Every flight. I always
wrote letters to my family.

247
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:45,980
I would give them to my brother and then
when I came back he would throw them in

248
00:15:45,981 --> 00:15:49,700
the garbage. And the idea was if I
didn't come back, he would hand them out.

249
00:15:49,701 --> 00:15:52,610
And I did the same thing
for him when he flew.

250
00:15:53,570 --> 00:15:56,120
Pretty soon you're heading up to
the launch pad on your first flight.

251
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:59,840
Mine was on the space shuttle Discovery
and the launchpad has completely

252
00:15:59,841 --> 00:16:02,750
abandoned, uh, cause the shuttles,

253
00:16:02,751 --> 00:16:06,710
the giant bomb on the top of this hill
fully fueled 5 million pounds of liquid

254
00:16:06,711 --> 00:16:10,730
oxygen, liquid hydrogen,
two solid rocket motors, uh,

255
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:12,570
places abandoned it.
W it,

256
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:15,770
with the exception of you and your six
crew mates and a few people that are

257
00:16:15,771 --> 00:16:17,330
going to help you to get strapped in.

258
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:22,190
And you get in the space shuttle about a
three and a half hours prior to launch,

259
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:23,840
you get strapped in tight.

260
00:16:23,841 --> 00:16:26,060
You're lying on your back and
your orange pressure suit.

261
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:30,710
The guys and girls that get you strapped
in and they tell you they bolt the

262
00:16:30,711 --> 00:16:33,860
hatch clothes and take off
and get about five miles away,

263
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:37,520
clock starts counting down towards zero.
And uh,

264
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:40,160
you're getting all these
systems ready for launch.

265
00:16:40,161 --> 00:16:43,880
The auxiliary power unit that powers
the hydraulics, the electrical system,

266
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:47,780
all the different engines,
the main engines that you use for liftoff,

267
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:52,220
environmental control system, which is
the life support system, the computers,

268
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:55,970
they all have to be perfect.
Clock gets to nine minutes and it stops.

269
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:59,450
That's to give you time to catch up if
you happen to be behind and what you're

270
00:16:59,451 --> 00:17:03,260
doing. It's also the time you
think, man, this is really stupid.

271
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,710
Flying into space for the first time.

272
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:12,350
It's not something you really expect
to ever think you'd do for real. Uh,

273
00:17:12,351 --> 00:17:16,740
at least for me and this kid that couldn't
do his homework. Uh, and then the,

274
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:21,530
but you can't get away, right?
You're strapped in and hatches,

275
00:17:21,531 --> 00:17:22,610
bolted closed.

276
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:27,350
Plus you wouldn't want to be the first
astronaut ever run away from the rocket.

277
00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:30,770
I wouldn't look good on the fever.
Now. It'd be a bad thing I am.

278
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:32,450
That would not be good on your resume.

279
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:37,550
Ran Away from space launch first ever.

280
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:40,130
Um,
clock picks up,

281
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:43,930
it gets to a minute and then 30 seconds
at 30 seconds of space shuttle computers

282
00:17:43,931 --> 00:17:47,300
take over the launch. Um, six seconds.

283
00:17:47,301 --> 00:17:51,270
The main engines light a million pounds
of thrust, but you don't go anywhere.

284
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:54,420
If you're bolted to the launchpad
by these eight giant bolts,

285
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:57,480
the clock goes five,
four, three, two, one.

286
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:00,750
Those bolts are exploded
open simultaneously.

287
00:18:00,751 --> 00:18:04,890
The solid rocket motors are lit and
it feels like the hand of God has just

288
00:18:04,891 --> 00:18:08,310
picked, picked you up off the launchpad
and is throwing you out into outer space.

289
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:12,690
You feel every pound of that
7 million pounds of thrust.

290
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:16,860
And I know if you've watched the shuttle
launch on TV or been there in person,

291
00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:20,940
it looks like it's like lifting
off slowly when you're inside.

292
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:22,680
There is nothing slow about this.

293
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:28,680
You get the feeling you're
going somewhere, you're not
sure where you're going,

294
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:31,110
but you know you're not
coming back to Florida.

295
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:35,280
And after eight and a half minutes,
you are flying around the earth,

296
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:40,281
that 17,500 miles an hour floating
around the earth and zero g.

297
00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:45,900
Now to contrast this with the shuttle
launch, you know, or the Soyuz launch,

298
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,160
the shuttle and the Soyuz,

299
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:51,510
I flew twice on the shuttle and then
twice on the Russian Soyuz and the shuttle

300
00:18:51,511 --> 00:18:54,020
was disbanded in,
uh,

301
00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:56,680
2011 was the last flight.

302
00:18:56,681 --> 00:19:00,990
It's like any wife launch to
the ice is now the series. Yeah.

303
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:06,020
So now our access to space for China
has the ability to launch people.

304
00:19:07,530 --> 00:19:09,960
They don't do it very often,
but you know,

305
00:19:09,961 --> 00:19:14,670
the access to space for the rest of the
world with people is through Russia.

306
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:18,300
And the Soyuz and the shuttle
are similar in that, you know,

307
00:19:18,301 --> 00:19:22,530
they both launch people into space.
And that's where the similarity stops.

308
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:28,880
My first Soyuz launch was in 2010 and
then I flew my last Soyuz launch ever

309
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:34,050
launched in March of 2015 for this
year in space. Mission landed,

310
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:38,820
um, a year later practically.
And just to contrast,

311
00:19:38,821 --> 00:19:40,620
I'll tell you a little bit
about the Soyuz launch.

312
00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:43,500
So he was a smaller than the shuttle also,
you know,

313
00:19:43,501 --> 00:19:48,501
a bomb on the top of a hill fully fueled
with liquid oxygen and liquid kerosene

314
00:19:50,071 --> 00:19:55,071
is the fuel they use instead of
hydrogen and a you getting a similar,

315
00:19:57,060 --> 00:20:01,950
you get in a bus and head up to the
launch pad with your crew mates saw uses a

316
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:06,030
bomb on the launch pad on the top
of this hill, just like the shuttle.

317
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:08,940
But you get up there and
the place is not abandoned.

318
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:13,350
There's like a hundred people up there
milling around the base of this fully

319
00:20:13,351 --> 00:20:18,270
fueled rocket. All this vapor coming off
the thing and the Russians, you know,

320
00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:20,670
and I, I tell a few jokes,
jokes about the Russians,

321
00:20:20,671 --> 00:20:24,090
but I have a lot of respect
for the cosmonauts and the
people I've worked in the

322
00:20:24,091 --> 00:20:26,100
space program with.
You know,

323
00:20:26,101 --> 00:20:29,310
just different cultures look at
things different ways. And you know,

324
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:34,311
what's very important to a Russian is if
your friends are going on a long trip,

325
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:36,570
you're going to be there to say goodbye.

326
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,720
Even if it's at the base
of a fully fueled rocket.

327
00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:43,070
So there are a hundred people up there
and you're just trying to get through

328
00:20:43,071 --> 00:20:48,010
them to get to the launchpad. Some of
them are smoking cigarettes. Swear to God.

329
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:50,680
You're like,
that guy's smoking.

330
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:54,670
So you want to get in that rocket as
fast as you can because there's an

331
00:20:54,671 --> 00:20:57,420
emergency escape system up on top.
Thanks.

332
00:20:57,421 --> 00:21:01,510
He had a rocket blow up on the launchpad
and killed like over a hundred people.

333
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:05,330
Then they still allow smoking up there.
Um,

334
00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:10,510
she get in and it's, it's
cramped, it's loud, it's hot.

335
00:21:10,511 --> 00:21:15,460
You're visors fogging up,
you're all strapped in tight.

336
00:21:15,461 --> 00:21:19,820
A few hours before launch,
there's no countdown clock and the he was,

337
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:23,200
they didn't seem to need to
put a countdown clock in there.

338
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:26,800
This was going to be one of the rockets
that like launch nuclear missiles during

339
00:21:26,801 --> 00:21:31,090
the Cold War. After
awhile you're like, Hey,

340
00:21:31,091 --> 00:21:35,560
what time are we leaving?
It's like 10 10 right.

341
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:38,020
Does that Moscow time or biking or tone?

342
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:41,890
Eventually someone comes up on
the radio and says ignition,

343
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:48,810
and I could just picture that guy smoking
just running out there with him with

344
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:53,650
his light. Half off you the same
question. Yeah. And then you know,

345
00:21:53,651 --> 00:21:56,770
you do lift off slowly in the Soyuz
cause there's no solid rocket motors,

346
00:21:56,771 --> 00:22:00,130
but still within nine minutes you're
flying around the earth at 25 times the

347
00:22:00,131 --> 00:22:04,690
speed of sound. I quite liked you
talked about the rituals, uh, as you,

348
00:22:04,810 --> 00:22:05,600
as you go,

349
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:09,010
the questions have so many and he seemed
to be what the first time and then when

350
00:22:09,011 --> 00:22:10,750
his dad that keep doing that,

351
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,780
you could talk through a couple of
the stranger ones, you know? Yeah.

352
00:22:13,781 --> 00:22:17,710
The Russians are a little bit more
superstitious than Americans I think by

353
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:18,221
culture.

354
00:22:18,221 --> 00:22:23,221
But we also have a superstitions in
the u s space program as an example.

355
00:22:24,130 --> 00:22:28,030
After you get suited up and
your orange space suit you, uh,

356
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:34,210
you play a round of, you play
a card game, low ball poker.

357
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:36,340
It's got a specific name.
I forget the name of it.

358
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:39,130
I think I may have mentioned in the book,
but I'm,

359
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:43,720
the commander of the mission has to
lose or you can't leave the building.

360
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:48,170
And if he is doing really well it's people
start to get nervous because she was

361
00:22:48,171 --> 00:22:51,280
looking at his clock and you have to be
walking out at a certain time because

362
00:22:51,281 --> 00:22:54,970
you have the schedule, the keep and if
the guy starts keeps winning, you know,

363
00:22:54,971 --> 00:22:58,120
eventually what you do is you kick people
out of the game until eventually it's

364
00:22:58,121 --> 00:22:59,290
just like one on one.

365
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:04,120
But I've seen people that keep
winning and I not say that. So He's,

366
00:23:04,121 --> 00:23:08,740
my luck is bad luck is, yeah.
Yeah. He has to lose. So he loses,

367
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:13,800
he uses up his bad luck before you go
to the launchpad and then 18 you'll also

368
00:23:14,201 --> 00:23:19,090
on the launch pad device, then you,
you'll buy locks. Just doesn't matter. Oh,

369
00:23:19,091 --> 00:23:22,480
but yeah, the commander represents
the whole crew, so yeah.

370
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:25,150
Yeah.
It's just about him.

371
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:29,110
I don't think it really matters if he
wins or loses to be honest with you.

372
00:23:29,111 --> 00:23:33,720
But it's tradition. Um, and
the Russian space programs,

373
00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:36,010
also traditions.
We always watched the same movie,

374
00:23:36,011 --> 00:23:38,170
the white son of a desert or something.

375
00:23:38,171 --> 00:23:41,230
That's a comedy because they
had an accident in the Soyuz.

376
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:45,710
The next crew watch that movie and
they never had another accident,

377
00:23:45,711 --> 00:23:50,711
so there'll be watching that movie all
the way until they have another accident.

378
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:51,943
Hopefully not.

379
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:56,360
We also stopped the bus on the way to
the launch pad and the same exact spot.

380
00:23:56,361 --> 00:23:58,910
Yuri Gagarin stopped the
bus because he had to pee.

381
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:03,050
So we get out of the bus,
we undo our pressure suit.

382
00:24:03,051 --> 00:24:05,840
That's just been pressured check
to extensively pressure check.

383
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:10,220
We break the Seal and we pee on
the bus tire in the same spot.

384
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:14,870
Yuri Gagarin and the FEMA national
experience more buffalo with them as well?

385
00:24:14,871 --> 00:24:15,740
Yeah,
they bring a bottle.

386
00:24:15,741 --> 00:24:19,520
I've heard they spray their water or
in some cases urine if they're really

387
00:24:19,521 --> 00:24:20,331
superstitious.

388
00:24:20,331 --> 00:24:24,110
They brought some of their own urine with
them so they don't have to completely

389
00:24:24,111 --> 00:24:27,350
get out of the suit. You know, it's
funny though, people are like, wow,

390
00:24:27,351 --> 00:24:30,710
you do that pressure check and you spend
all that time to make sure the suit

391
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:35,360
suit works and is sealed and then you
just go and do the whole thing and get

392
00:24:35,361 --> 00:24:40,010
into the soil. Soy Use. They say, I can't
believe the Russians do that. And I go,

393
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:44,910
we do the same thing in the u s we
just have a bathroom on the launch pad,

394
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:47,900
the last toilet on earth.
And if you're leaving earth,

395
00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:50,510
you're going to be your damn well
going to use that last toilet.

396
00:24:50,870 --> 00:24:54,110
So you do the same thing. You
get out of your suit, you pay,

397
00:24:54,150 --> 00:24:58,810
you put it all back on getting the shuttle
and go. That's great. I mean lunch.

398
00:24:59,010 --> 00:25:02,550
That's awesome. That's
great. Um, well, uh,

399
00:25:02,551 --> 00:25:04,610
I'm sort of interested
with your given space.

400
00:25:04,611 --> 00:25:07,580
How did you cope with the isolation as a
parent in the book where you talk about

401
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:12,080
you were the only person in the u s
section? Yeah, I mean it started, did,

402
00:25:12,081 --> 00:25:15,710
it starts off as a few.
I've got the ads myself that will space.

403
00:25:16,610 --> 00:25:18,740
Is isolation trading
something that you get taught.

404
00:25:19,130 --> 00:25:21,550
It's not something they teach you.
They,

405
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:24,500
they definitely make sure
you're not like cluster phobic.

406
00:25:25,730 --> 00:25:29,630
When you do the astronauts selection,
they'll actually, you know,

407
00:25:29,631 --> 00:25:33,230
hook you up with a heart monitor,
put you in a small rubber bag,

408
00:25:33,890 --> 00:25:35,030
thick rubber bag,

409
00:25:35,090 --> 00:25:38,930
zip it up and push you into
a dark closet and leave you.

410
00:25:38,930 --> 00:25:43,660
They're not telling you how long
you're going to be in it. And uh, he,

411
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:47,840
there's no way you can fake not being
claustrophobic and that environment.

412
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:52,970
But they do check that, you
know, I, we had a nap. He
like, yeah, I got all asleep.

413
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:54,920
It's not, it's not. Yeah.

414
00:25:55,100 --> 00:26:00,100
But I was fortunate in that I flew for
six months before I flew for a year,

415
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:06,290
which is good training for a year in space
cause I knew what I was getting into.

416
00:26:07,370 --> 00:26:12,020
I actually liked being on the US side
of the space station by myself. Um,

417
00:26:13,730 --> 00:26:16,430
not that I don't like
the people on there with,

418
00:26:16,431 --> 00:26:21,030
but it's just easier in a lot of
ways. It's very quiet. It's peaceful.

419
00:26:21,050 --> 00:26:22,580
When you put something somewhere,

420
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:27,290
you know it's going to be there when you
come back and have a very orderly. Um,

421
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:29,150
so actually on this last flight,

422
00:26:29,151 --> 00:26:33,830
I was alone basically on the US side of
the space station for about six weeks.

423
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:38,090
Okay. Yeah, it wasn't bad. I liked it. Um,

424
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:43,040
and uh, but to answer your full question,
how do you deal with the isolation?

425
00:26:43,470 --> 00:26:46,980
You have good connectivity with Earth.
I mean, you could make phone calls,

426
00:26:46,981 --> 00:26:50,880
you have email, you have video
conferencing capability. I mean,

427
00:26:50,881 --> 00:26:55,830
people are amazed at the, uh, the ability
we have to communicate with the ground,

428
00:26:55,831 --> 00:26:58,350
which I find fascinating
that people are shocked.

429
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:04,170
You can have email and space. I'm like,
yeah. You know, satellite communication,

430
00:27:05,310 --> 00:27:09,360
satellite, satellite, I
mean with the Internet,

431
00:27:09,390 --> 00:27:12,300
I guess social media plays in
increasing part and an astronaut,

432
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:17,310
that public perception thing. Did you
use social media the on I did. You know,

433
00:27:17,311 --> 00:27:21,150
um,
before I launched,

434
00:27:21,151 --> 00:27:26,130
President Obama invited me to the
state of the Union address and he, he,

435
00:27:26,131 --> 00:27:31,050
uh, during the address he challenged
me to Instagram the experience.

436
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:35,790
So, of course I tried to do that as best
I could. I actually thought it felt like,

437
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,960
you know, engaging with the
public with the, you know,

438
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:41,190
social media was kind of a responsibility,
you know,

439
00:27:41,191 --> 00:27:45,510
the public pays for this program and
to keep them involved is important.

440
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:50,580
It was also good for Ameco and I in our
relationship for us to have something,

441
00:27:50,850 --> 00:27:54,630
it was kind of like a personal
project to do that had, you know,

442
00:27:54,631 --> 00:27:58,020
daily feedback in how
well you were doing at it.

443
00:27:58,021 --> 00:28:00,810
With like Mika worked in
payoff when I said yes,

444
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:05,190
she worked at the NASA public affairs,
although they made her do this as a,

445
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,830
you know,
outside of her work hours,

446
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:13,290
which is hard to believe that
that was the case. But yeah,

447
00:28:13,291 --> 00:28:14,580
so I tried to engage the public.

448
00:28:14,581 --> 00:28:19,260
I often would have in my free time do
some like tweet chats and things. One day,

449
00:28:19,261 --> 00:28:24,261
actually I'm answering questions on a
Saturday on Twitter and President Obama,

450
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:29,820
um, asks a question, he says, Hey Scott,

451
00:28:30,390 --> 00:28:34,500
do you ever look out the window
and just freak out? And I'm like,

452
00:28:35,310 --> 00:28:36,250
no,
Mr President.

453
00:28:36,251 --> 00:28:40,980
And I don't really freak out about
anything except getting a Twitter question

454
00:28:40,981 --> 00:28:44,550
from you.
Within seconds,

455
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:49,020
Buzz Aldrin jumps into the
conversation and he says,

456
00:28:49,650 --> 00:28:52,740
Mister President,
he's only in low earth orbit.

457
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:58,350
I went,
I went all the way to the moon.

458
00:29:02,130 --> 00:29:06,690
So I got trolled
while I was in space.

459
00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:11,760
By the second man on the moon. It's like
the greatest thing that's ever happened.

460
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:17,180
Um, what's your next big challenge?
I mean, sort of, you've, you've,

461
00:29:17,210 --> 00:29:18,660
you don't going back
into space because Emily,

462
00:29:18,661 --> 00:29:20,280
that's that part of your
life is finished now.

463
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:22,630
You'll still have an involved in NASA.

464
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:27,640
You'll on the bolt to decide who the
next program I call my next big challenge

465
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:33,030
tomorrow. Okay. Yeah. But she has
been going one day after another,

466
00:29:33,031 --> 00:29:34,500
especially when writing this book.

467
00:29:34,530 --> 00:29:39,120
We've been on this book tour since
October 16th with one day off on the

468
00:29:39,121 --> 00:29:43,660
weekends. Um, you know, it's challenging
coming back after a year in space.

469
00:29:43,661 --> 00:29:44,980
You don't feel well,

470
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:49,690
it's hard to adjust back to life
without this very stringent schedule.

471
00:29:50,290 --> 00:29:55,290
I went from being a government employee
for nearly 30 years to basically a,

472
00:29:58,121 --> 00:30:02,290
an employee like uh, uh, I forget, I
don't even know what the right term is.

473
00:30:02,291 --> 00:30:06,520
A small business owner
with you know, dots. Yeah.

474
00:30:06,550 --> 00:30:11,550
Like a consultant and had to establish
like very quickly to like kind of high

475
00:30:12,611 --> 00:30:16,540
end keynote speeches. I wrote this
book which took like 18 months,

476
00:30:16,930 --> 00:30:19,810
wrote a kids book,
did the Audio Book,

477
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:24,080
signed 27,000 Tippins for this
thing, you know, all these things.

478
00:30:24,081 --> 00:30:25,960
This has been one after
another after another.

479
00:30:25,961 --> 00:30:30,580
So that come January I'll start to
start to think harder about like,

480
00:30:30,581 --> 00:30:35,350
what do I really want to do for the
next, you know, five to 10 years. Yeah.

481
00:30:35,570 --> 00:30:39,350
Well I'd love to take some questions.
Maybe I'll work for Google. We,

482
00:30:39,410 --> 00:30:40,580
I'm sure we would love to have you.

483
00:30:41,270 --> 00:30:43,610
So have a think about some questions
and we'll pass the mic around.

484
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:47,780
I've got one more. Are you talking
to me? Let me think of this.

485
00:30:47,781 --> 00:30:48,800
So speaking and Google.

486
00:30:49,130 --> 00:30:53,150
So I'm in Russia and I'm
the head of the national,

487
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:56,420
so office and Star City and my,

488
00:30:57,560 --> 00:31:01,460
I was like the lead Nasa guy there and
the guy who's like the safety engineer,

489
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:05,300
he says to me one day, he goes,
hey, I want to show you something.

490
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:11,030
He opens up his computer
and he says,

491
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:15,660
see this? And it was a little
rectangular window. And I said,

492
00:31:15,661 --> 00:31:18,020
Google underneath. He said, see this,

493
00:31:18,770 --> 00:31:21,890
you should invest all your
money in the right now.

494
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,760
And I'm looking at it and
I'm like, man, I don't,

495
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:25,653
yeah.

496
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:30,490
How wrong was

497
00:31:33,950 --> 00:31:35,990
I? You talk about, uh,

498
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:39,570
being in the astronaut office and being
surrounded by these great astronauts of

499
00:31:39,571 --> 00:31:43,140
the history of which one
was Senator Glenn. Yeah.

500
00:31:43,430 --> 00:31:45,980
I view ever thought about going
into politics is that it's not a,

501
00:31:45,981 --> 00:31:49,070
is that something you'd be
interested in? You know, I think

502
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:54,030
I would have a lot to contribute.

503
00:31:54,031 --> 00:31:58,320
The problem I have is, um,
well, there are a few problems.

504
00:31:58,530 --> 00:32:03,240
One is that I'm neither a
Democrat or Republican, you know,

505
00:32:03,241 --> 00:32:06,930
in the u s some,
I'm not a registered independent,

506
00:32:06,931 --> 00:32:10,080
but I voted for Republicans.
I've voted for Democrats.

507
00:32:10,081 --> 00:32:12,450
I'm kind of in the middle on some issues.

508
00:32:12,451 --> 00:32:15,330
I look like a Republican and
others I look like a Democrat,

509
00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:19,320
but the bigger problem is
in the United States, and I,

510
00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:23,700
you guys might not even understand
this because this is a uniquely a us,

511
00:32:23,730 --> 00:32:25,380
perhaps a uniquely us thing,

512
00:32:25,381 --> 00:32:30,381
but we have two things that prevent
moderates from a winning elections.

513
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:35,400
Uh,
one is called gerrymandering.

514
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:40,610
Gerrymandering is when you create a
political district that includes all the

515
00:32:40,611 --> 00:32:44,870
people of one party and you've,
what you do is if you're that party,

516
00:32:44,871 --> 00:32:48,560
you sue the government to say,
I'm going to take this swath,

517
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:51,680
and it's going to be mostly Democrats,
mostly Republicans.

518
00:32:52,190 --> 00:32:57,190
And the people in the United States that
run in the primaries are the hardcore

519
00:32:58,190 --> 00:33:01,700
people in the party. They're the
extreme right? Or the extreme left.

520
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:05,000
And if you're running in one of
these gerrymandered districts,

521
00:33:05,001 --> 00:33:08,990
if you're a Democrat and you're running
in a gerrymandered Democrat district,

522
00:33:09,410 --> 00:33:13,220
you have to be on the left side
of the party, the extreme left.

523
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:15,830
Likewise the extreme
right for a Republican.

524
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:20,990
So you can't even get on the ticket
unless you're an extremist. And the key,

525
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:24,680
you either have to be an extremist
or you have to be a very clever liar,

526
00:33:25,490 --> 00:33:27,830
you know, you have to make,
believe you're on the extreme,

527
00:33:27,831 --> 00:33:31,010
then somehow it's pivot to the
center. Very, very hard to do.

528
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:35,930
So it doesn't make uh,
the situation,

529
00:33:36,110 --> 00:33:38,360
um,
you know,

530
00:33:38,361 --> 00:33:42,620
acceptable for or workable
for people that are moderates.

531
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:45,470
Um, we have an independent
party in the United States,

532
00:33:45,471 --> 00:33:50,120
but it's not one that's ever been very
successful because of things like this

533
00:33:50,121 --> 00:33:54,020
thing called citizens United
citizens United was a lawsuit,

534
00:33:54,021 --> 00:33:58,970
but it allows corporations to give
unlimited amounts of money to political

535
00:33:58,971 --> 00:34:02,540
action committees that support
candidates. So basically, you know,

536
00:34:02,541 --> 00:34:07,541
you become behold into these donors that
are giving you tons of money and if you

537
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:12,560
don't want of, um, the
somebodies, you know,

538
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:18,140
working for some corporation when you're
really supposed to be representing the

539
00:34:18,141 --> 00:34:22,660
people, it's hard to win. But
you did vote from space. I voted.

540
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:26,150
It was that planning process.
Yeah. Yeah. Pretty easy.

541
00:34:26,210 --> 00:34:30,060
I didn't have to wait in line, just
pumped about it. Gap Questions.

542
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:32,570
Must be questions. Yeah. This
is kind of microphone on you.

543
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:36,840
All right.
Thank you so much for coming to visit us.

544
00:34:36,870 --> 00:34:41,100
Really appreciate that question
about the Hubble telescope. Uh,

545
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:44,760
how was it, uh, how was it
to work on? What's it like?

546
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:50,380
So yeah, my first flight was to
huddle and it's uh, it's really big.

547
00:34:50,650 --> 00:34:53,410
It's like the size of a school bus,
maybe bigger.

548
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:56,930
One side of it that you rarely see is,
um,

549
00:34:57,580 --> 00:34:59,110
I don't know why you really see this side,

550
00:34:59,111 --> 00:35:02,800
but once I'd always faces the
sun just kind of like burnt,

551
00:35:03,550 --> 00:35:06,640
burnt to a crisp almost.
And um,

552
00:35:06,820 --> 00:35:09,760
but it's amazing to see a,
uh,

553
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:14,890
an instrument that's been out in space
for so long that has shown us more about

554
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:18,280
at least the general public,
more about the universe. Um,

555
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:23,920
then anything else ever.
Um, so I really enjoyed,

556
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:26,200
uh, working on it. I didn't,

557
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:29,080
I didn't do any of this space walks
because I was a pilot of the mission.

558
00:35:29,350 --> 00:35:34,180
We actually launched right before y
two K on this flight and December.

559
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:39,840
And NASA had us land early cause they
were worried that the computers on the

560
00:35:39,931 --> 00:35:40,441
space shuttle,

561
00:35:40,441 --> 00:35:44,280
we're going to divide by zero and we're
going to go through some worm hole

562
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:47,640
end up on the other side of the galaxy.

563
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:52,090
I'll have to wait another thousand years
to see if that would have happened. You,

564
00:35:52,450 --> 00:35:55,350
you take it, see the outside of the
space station quite a lot. And was that,

565
00:35:55,351 --> 00:35:57,390
you discussed how,
talk about how that was kind of,

566
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:59,660
you'd be seen a tiny
asteroid will pop off.

567
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:03,390
You had the opportunity on this flight
to do a three space walks. I'd never,

568
00:36:03,391 --> 00:36:07,320
never done a spacewalk before because
as a pilot or commander of the space

569
00:36:07,321 --> 00:36:07,561
shuttle,

570
00:36:07,561 --> 00:36:12,561
you just don't do them because it's risky
and you're a critical to landing the

571
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:18,210
spacecraft safely. The mission
specialists are more expendable.

572
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:23,670
Um, but yeah, going outside for the
first time is pretty, pretty crazy.

573
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:28,200
Um,
neither of us had done a spacewalk before,

574
00:36:28,201 --> 00:36:29,640
so I was the more experienced guy.

575
00:36:29,641 --> 00:36:34,110
So I got to go out first and open the
hatch and you open the hatch and earth is

576
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:39,500
250 miles below you and
you're going 17,500 miles an
hour and you're making sure

577
00:36:40,141 --> 00:36:40,680
your,

578
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:45,680
for one it's hard to get out because the
suit and the whole that is the hatch or

579
00:36:46,231 --> 00:36:50,820
like almost the exact same
size. So, and it's square,

580
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:53,460
the suit's kind of square.
But this hatch is round.

581
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:56,760
It's like putting around a
square peg in a round hole.

582
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,650
It has to be perfect to get out.

583
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:03,660
And it feels like at first you're kind
of climbing down with your head down

584
00:37:03,661 --> 00:37:04,441
towards the earth.

585
00:37:04,441 --> 00:37:07,620
Although you know you don't have gravity
so you don't physically feel like

586
00:37:07,621 --> 00:37:09,990
you're upside down, but visually
you feel like you're upside down.

587
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:14,520
It was interesting when I got halfway out,
all of a sudden my orientation,

588
00:37:14,521 --> 00:37:16,050
my reference frame shifted.

589
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:20,580
So now all of a sudden I felt like I was
climbing out of the sun roof of a car

590
00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:24,060
and there was this alien
planet over my head,

591
00:37:24,270 --> 00:37:27,750
like in a science fiction movie,
like right there.

592
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:32,340
And I felt like I was on earth and there
was this alien planet and the look like

593
00:37:32,341 --> 00:37:34,800
it was just going to come
crashing down upon me. Wow.

594
00:37:35,070 --> 00:37:38,970
But I had to really focus so I didn't
like lose anything or very distracting.

595
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:40,290
That kind of situation.

596
00:37:40,350 --> 00:37:43,260
I think you talked about if you've lost
focus and I went no longer tethered to

597
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:45,020
the [inaudible] U.
Dot.

598
00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:49,620
S You'd done w if you are a model an inch
away as well, you know, in the u s suit,

599
00:37:49,621 --> 00:37:50,371
we do have a,

600
00:37:50,371 --> 00:37:55,080
a jet pack that has a little bit of fuel
that you could potentially fly yourself

601
00:37:55,081 --> 00:37:58,830
back if you became detached.
Um,

602
00:37:59,130 --> 00:38:04,030
it's challenging to use. Often when
you're practicing this in a VR situation,

603
00:38:04,050 --> 00:38:08,700
you don't Miss, you miss the station
altogether. And in those cases,

604
00:38:08,701 --> 00:38:11,460
you know, if you're an inch
away and you can't reach,

605
00:38:11,461 --> 00:38:15,180
you might as well be a mile away.
The results are still the same. Wow.

606
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:18,653
He's got the microphone.

607
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:20,433
Yeah.

608
00:38:23,390 --> 00:38:25,340
I'm interested, um, say hey,

609
00:38:25,341 --> 00:38:29,940
what the experience is once she returned
to us off to you're in spice and was it

610
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:34,190
how to, to kind of readjust from
the mental or physical perspective?

611
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:39,250
Yeah, so there's, you know, there's,
I think two general adjustments.

612
00:38:39,251 --> 00:38:43,990
There's the physical and the
psychological part physically.

613
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:49,240
You know, at first you're, you're
nauseous. Although, you know,

614
00:38:49,241 --> 00:38:51,850
I didn't throw up this time. I threw
up after six months. Surprising.

615
00:38:51,851 --> 00:38:54,700
I didn't throw up after a year. I
wish I could have, but I couldn't.

616
00:38:55,270 --> 00:38:57,910
I would've felt a lot better
if I to just puking my guts up.

617
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:01,780
I don't know if some of you ever saw
pictures of me coming out of the,

618
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:06,340
out of the soil. You sum it up. If there's
one, I'll find one. Yeah. But anyway,

619
00:39:06,341 --> 00:39:10,120
I had this, you get essentially saying
that UK book has different pictures,

620
00:39:10,121 --> 00:39:14,350
but I had this big um,
big smile on my face when I got,

621
00:39:14,351 --> 00:39:17,950
when I landed and it was not because
I was feeling well because I wasn't,

622
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:21,190
I was just trying to look better
than the two guys I was with

623
00:39:23,410 --> 00:39:25,330
was actually hoping to
get an academy award.

624
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:31,860
But I understand they sometimes make
mistakes so maybe next time I fly in space

625
00:39:31,991 --> 00:39:35,710
for a year, he talked about
that day [inaudible] to Chaz
for the Russian doctors.

626
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:40,240
As I said, anybody wants to kind of
walk. If you had to, you wouldn't walk.

627
00:39:40,241 --> 00:39:44,110
Well the first time I started
walking I make a comment.

628
00:39:44,230 --> 00:39:47,110
There's actually this PBS special that
just came out and they actually show the

629
00:39:47,111 --> 00:39:51,400
video of me and the tent doing some post
flight test right after I got back and

630
00:39:51,401 --> 00:39:54,670
I say something like, Y'all, I'm
walking and I'm like going like this.

631
00:39:55,990 --> 00:40:00,160
Like I'm walking like jar jar
Binks felt like jar jar Binks.

632
00:40:00,610 --> 00:40:04,060
But you for the first few
days, you're sore, your joints,

633
00:40:04,061 --> 00:40:06,430
your muscles are stiff.
I had a,

634
00:40:06,431 --> 00:40:09,730
I was nauseous for a week
anywhere my skin touched anything.

635
00:40:09,731 --> 00:40:12,460
I had rashes and hives
for a couple of weeks.

636
00:40:13,230 --> 00:40:17,050
Like I said in when I was reading, when
I stand, stood up, my legs would swell,

637
00:40:17,051 --> 00:40:21,310
I could actually see him swelling, no kid
and just like us dealing all the blood,

638
00:40:21,311 --> 00:40:26,110
just infusing in the bottom of my legs.
It was like, and this is not good.

639
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:29,880
Um,
and how long did that take to get?

640
00:40:30,730 --> 00:40:35,390
I would say the physical stuff
completely. A couple of months. Okay.

641
00:40:35,950 --> 00:40:40,660
The mental part of it,
probably more like eight months.

642
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:45,900
Because you live in this very controlled
environment where you have a schedule

643
00:40:46,001 --> 00:40:49,330
that you are following, you
know, every five minutes.

644
00:40:49,331 --> 00:40:53,740
Now sometimes the blocks of time that
are dedicated to your activity are 10

645
00:40:53,741 --> 00:40:56,980
hours. If it's a spacewalk other
times, if it's throw the switch,

646
00:40:56,981 --> 00:40:59,710
it's five minutes.
But you were following that every,

647
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:05,140
all the time for a year. And then when
you get home you don't have that anymore.

648
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:07,510
And I both times after my long flights,

649
00:41:07,511 --> 00:41:12,511
I would find myself just sitting
on the couch with all this stuff.

650
00:41:12,671 --> 00:41:16,180
To do, but because no one was telling
me when to do it or what I had to do,

651
00:41:16,181 --> 00:41:21,181
I just sat there and it took a
while to readapt to living on earth.

652
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:26,020
There are actually some good physical
things about being in space for a long

653
00:41:26,021 --> 00:41:29,590
time and that is when you, uh,
when you don't use your feet,

654
00:41:29,950 --> 00:41:34,550
all the calluses, they fall
off. It takes a few months.

655
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:38,990
It's kind of disgusting when you take
your socks off and you get this big

656
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:43,250
cloud of foot Dandruff,

657
00:41:44,310 --> 00:41:47,690
you never want to take your socks off in
the vicinity of one of your crew mates.

658
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:51,860
But then when you get, you know, after
a few months you have these baby feet.

659
00:41:52,790 --> 00:41:53,600
And I,

660
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:57,320
after my first long flight when no one
knew who I was and that it was up there,

661
00:41:57,321 --> 00:41:58,880
like two days after I got home,

662
00:41:58,881 --> 00:42:03,590
I went to get a massage and one of these
commercial massage places you at the

663
00:42:03,591 --> 00:42:07,130
end of the massage, they rub your
feet, ladies rub my feet and she says,

664
00:42:07,810 --> 00:42:12,140
you have the softest feet I've
ever felt in my entire life.

665
00:42:13,370 --> 00:42:17,180
All I said to her was, thank
you, I'm very proud of them.

666
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:19,550
And then I left.

667
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:23,380
He's probably till still talking
about that bald guy with the song.

668
00:42:25,790 --> 00:42:26,870
I think a question of hat

669
00:42:29,090 --> 00:42:31,050
you've given the unique getting insane.

670
00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:35,680
What can we Russians and then
I'd like to ask you about a,

671
00:42:35,790 --> 00:42:40,790
how would you like to see that those
are the future of collaborations with

672
00:42:42,781 --> 00:42:46,760
Russia in the meant fight? Yeah. Yeah. I

673
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:51,760
think our space cooperation with Russia's
is a great example of how to countries

674
00:42:54,230 --> 00:42:56,960
that at times we're enemies,

675
00:42:57,110 --> 00:43:01,160
sometimes not friends often conflict,

676
00:43:02,030 --> 00:43:07,030
but how we can work together
in this international
program for something that we

677
00:43:08,241 --> 00:43:09,080
both believe in,

678
00:43:09,081 --> 00:43:14,081
feel strongly about and do
it as a team and in space.

679
00:43:14,250 --> 00:43:17,840
Uh, even on the ground working,
preparing for space flight,

680
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:23,060
any kind of conflict that we ever had
our governments ever had does not affect

681
00:43:23,061 --> 00:43:26,570
our working relationship. You know,
we are friends, we are colleagues.

682
00:43:27,050 --> 00:43:31,640
What is more important to us is supporting
one another. Our personal safety,

683
00:43:31,790 --> 00:43:32,001
you know,

684
00:43:32,001 --> 00:43:37,001
we have to rely on each other sometimes
for our lives that any issues between

685
00:43:37,041 --> 00:43:41,720
our countries. We never really even
discuss much. Sometimes you do.

686
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:43,580
Like when I was on the space station,

687
00:43:43,581 --> 00:43:48,581
it's when Russia moved into Syria and
there was real concern that pretty soon,

688
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:52,640
um, due to some kind
of accident, you know,

689
00:43:52,641 --> 00:43:56,420
the u s and the Russian military would
have get into some kind of skirmishes.

690
00:43:56,420 --> 00:43:59,750
Fortunately that never happened.
We talked about that on the space station,

691
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:02,840
but it almost, we were talking
about a kind of in an abstract way,

692
00:44:02,841 --> 00:44:05,870
like we were talking about not
the United States and Russia,

693
00:44:05,871 --> 00:44:08,170
but like China and Germany.
Um,

694
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:11,330
and then we just realize,
hey,

695
00:44:11,331 --> 00:44:16,220
this is on earth and
we are in space and um,

696
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:21,020
that those issues don't
really translate up here.

697
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:25,160
Misha Kornienko, Mikhail
Kornienko, my, uh,

698
00:44:25,190 --> 00:44:28,940
Russian brother from another mother
that I spent a year in space with.

699
00:44:28,941 --> 00:44:31,740
He said he would say a few times
during the, he says, you know,

700
00:44:32,430 --> 00:44:36,150
if our country's ever want to solve
their issues, we have with one another,

701
00:44:36,690 --> 00:44:40,920
all we need to do is put our two
presidents in space for a year together.

702
00:44:43,770 --> 00:44:45,570
Although those two guys
might like it too much.

703
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:48,270
I just take one this table if in the back.

704
00:44:50,030 --> 00:44:53,590
Hello. Very nice work. Congratulations.

705
00:44:53,890 --> 00:44:56,140
So w we are computer science,
right?

706
00:44:56,141 --> 00:44:59,770
So whenever you watch a movie and
there's a computer guy doing stuff,

707
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:03,430
we look at that. So yeah, that never
going to happen. That's not like that.

708
00:45:03,820 --> 00:45:08,380
How do you feel when you watch
films like interstellar and Marsha,

709
00:45:08,410 --> 00:45:12,130
the Martian gravity, all these
kinds of movies from space that we,

710
00:45:12,131 --> 00:45:14,980
from our point of view, oh that
looks amazing. Might be like that.

711
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:15,970
How do you feel about it?

712
00:45:16,350 --> 00:45:18,930
Well,
I watched all of those movies in space.

713
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:22,830
You mentioned gravity. Yeah,
maybe not interstellar,

714
00:45:23,070 --> 00:45:27,600
but I definitely watched the Martian
and gravity in space. I actually,

715
00:45:27,601 --> 00:45:30,970
they sent us the Martian and a
couple of days before it, uh,

716
00:45:31,010 --> 00:45:35,370
it came out and we watched it
like a preview. I actually talk,

717
00:45:35,470 --> 00:45:40,470
talked to Matt Damon on the phone a couple
of days before it came out and he was

718
00:45:41,220 --> 00:45:43,920
interested in what we were doing.
It seems like he knew about as much,

719
00:45:44,310 --> 00:45:48,300
he knew him as much about spaces.
Maybe George Clooney does.

720
00:45:50,250 --> 00:45:54,720
But uh, yeah, the Martian was
pretty accurate. I think, you know,

721
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:57,570
there was things, there are always
things that are wrong with these movies.

722
00:45:57,571 --> 00:46:01,560
Like you know,
that storm they had on Mars,

723
00:46:01,561 --> 00:46:03,030
there's like no atmosphere on Mars.

724
00:46:03,031 --> 00:46:05,190
You wouldn't have something
like 800 mile an hour.

725
00:46:05,191 --> 00:46:06,810
You might have an 800 mile an hour wind,

726
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:10,770
but it's not going to knock anything over,
you know, because there's no air. Um,

727
00:46:11,970 --> 00:46:15,540
and the other thing that was weird with
the Martian as they always called the

728
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:18,270
commander and the female
commander on the rescue ship,

729
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:19,830
they would call her commander.

730
00:46:20,580 --> 00:46:24,500
We're on a first name basis
and then gravity, you know,

731
00:46:24,501 --> 00:46:28,770
gravity has got all kinds of technical
problems with it, but it's exciting,

732
00:46:28,980 --> 00:46:31,200
exciting movie.
Um,

733
00:46:31,470 --> 00:46:36,470
I think it's good that they took that
licensed to make it really dramatic.

734
00:46:37,350 --> 00:46:42,350
We watched it on the space station and
had this screen set up in the a node.

735
00:46:43,261 --> 00:46:47,490
One of the space station, which is a
u s laboratory module is in the back.

736
00:46:47,970 --> 00:46:48,803
And um,

737
00:46:49,790 --> 00:46:54,790
it's Kinda like watching a movie of your
house burning down whilst while you're

738
00:46:55,411 --> 00:46:56,244
inside of it.

739
00:46:57,480 --> 00:47:02,480
But there is the biggest regret of my
whole year in space was we're watching

740
00:47:02,971 --> 00:47:07,971
that movie and Sandra Bullock in this
scene with our short dark hair is floating

741
00:47:11,791 --> 00:47:16,740
through the lab module in her underwear
and Samantha Christopher ready,

742
00:47:16,741 --> 00:47:21,741
this Italian astronaut woman with her
short dark hair comes floating by in her

743
00:47:22,381 --> 00:47:24,570
like Spandex,
like gym shorts.

744
00:47:24,570 --> 00:47:29,570
She ran in and a tee shirt looking
exactly like her and I'm thinking I got to

745
00:47:30,631 --> 00:47:34,540
get a picture of this and then I didn't
because I felt like weird about it

746
00:47:35,450 --> 00:47:40,210
because you know she was in her gym
clothes and Sandra Bullock was in her

747
00:47:40,211 --> 00:47:42,020
underwear.
But it would have been the,

748
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:45,570
they would have been the the biggest
tweet ever from [inaudible] base.

749
00:47:46,710 --> 00:47:48,180
You actually,
I think you talk about,

750
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:51,570
I talk about that in the book compared
with not Watney unfavorably when you,

751
00:47:51,571 --> 00:47:54,700
you let some flowers. Yeah, we didn't
let the flowers and the system has some,

752
00:47:54,710 --> 00:47:58,060
if I was just, shit was just following
national rules on taking care of,

753
00:47:58,070 --> 00:47:59,950
we grew some vegetables,

754
00:47:59,951 --> 00:48:03,490
a lettuce in space and we
grew some Zinnias flowers,

755
00:48:03,491 --> 00:48:08,200
which apparently you can eat but you
don't eat them. The idea being if you can,

756
00:48:08,530 --> 00:48:10,900
you know, grow a flower, you can grow.

757
00:48:10,900 --> 00:48:13,730
Maybe something like a
tomato that was grown,

758
00:48:13,750 --> 00:48:17,680
these flowers and just following
the directions, water them,

759
00:48:17,681 --> 00:48:18,830
don't want it in a mortar them.

760
00:48:19,450 --> 00:48:23,350
There was so much time delay in the NASA
system of looking at the photos about

761
00:48:23,380 --> 00:48:26,200
the condition of the flowers.
When they would tell me to water them,

762
00:48:27,430 --> 00:48:31,960
they would be almost dead. When they
would tell me to stop watering them,

763
00:48:32,140 --> 00:48:36,680
they would be covered, they would
be wet and covered in mold. Um,

764
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:40,420
and I was fine with that because it was,
it's not my experiment.

765
00:48:40,421 --> 00:48:41,830
I was just doing what I was told.

766
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:47,170
And then one day I post a picture of
the flowers and some guy comes up and he

767
00:48:47,171 --> 00:48:50,440
says,
you are no mark Watney

768
00:48:52,570 --> 00:48:57,550
fight was on then. And then I
told [inaudible], I said, okay,

769
00:48:57,970 --> 00:48:59,320
if you want these flowers to live,

770
00:48:59,321 --> 00:49:02,050
you're going to have to just let me
decide when to one of them because there's

771
00:49:02,051 --> 00:49:03,940
too much time delay in the system.

772
00:49:04,470 --> 00:49:08,590
So I started like touching him and brought
him back to life and got them really

773
00:49:08,591 --> 00:49:08,981
nice.

774
00:49:08,981 --> 00:49:13,060
Occasionally I'd take them down to the
Russian segment and put them on the duct

775
00:49:13,061 --> 00:49:17,140
tape on their table is a
little centerpiece when we
were having dinner and they

776
00:49:17,141 --> 00:49:20,230
got a lot of attention and
people like the flowers.

777
00:49:20,980 --> 00:49:25,720
One day Sir gave all cough Russian
guy system and he goes, Scott,

778
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:30,760
why are you growing these
flowers? And I say, I say,

779
00:49:30,860 --> 00:49:34,060
Sergei, we're growing these. So
if we can grow these flowers,

780
00:49:34,061 --> 00:49:37,720
maybe we can grow something
that's more nutritious, uh,

781
00:49:37,750 --> 00:49:40,990
that we can eat to supplement our
nutrition on the space station.

782
00:49:40,991 --> 00:49:44,200
Especially if we're going to Mars
and go, the plan is, you know,

783
00:49:44,201 --> 00:49:48,580
we grow these flowers, then we can
grow tomatoes that we can eat. He goes,

784
00:49:49,450 --> 00:49:52,780
why would you want to grow tomatoes? And
there's just so we can eat them. He goes,

785
00:49:53,980 --> 00:49:58,670
you should grow potatoes,
you can live on potatoes,

786
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:02,120
you can't live on tomatoes
and you can make vodka

787
00:50:05,300 --> 00:50:08,030
is a great guy. Uh,
wait, one more question.

788
00:50:10,050 --> 00:50:10,883
Yep.

789
00:50:12,310 --> 00:50:14,940
Hi. Thank you very much for
your talk. Very inspiring. Yeah.

790
00:50:15,130 --> 00:50:18,850
Can you show some thoughts about the
potential of building a colony on Mars?

791
00:50:19,210 --> 00:50:22,600
The necessity,
feasibility and maybe even timeline.

792
00:50:24,390 --> 00:50:25,223
Hmm.

793
00:50:25,630 --> 00:50:28,180
What about journey to Mars?
Yeah, a colony to Mars. You know,

794
00:50:28,190 --> 00:50:29,900
I was asked a question when I was on the,

795
00:50:30,170 --> 00:50:34,340
on the space station by a
reporter and the question was,

796
00:50:34,341 --> 00:50:38,630
now that NASA has determined that there
was liquid water on Mars sometime during

797
00:50:38,631 --> 00:50:43,190
the year, will that help us get
there any sooner? That, I don't know.

798
00:50:43,191 --> 00:50:46,340
Maybe now if we found money on Mars,

799
00:50:47,780 --> 00:50:50,960
that would help us get there real quick
because that's what we need is money.

800
00:50:50,961 --> 00:50:55,250
Right. My brother often says, you know,
go into Mars is not about rocket science.

801
00:50:55,430 --> 00:50:57,590
It's about the political science.
You know,

802
00:50:57,591 --> 00:51:02,570
I think we know a lot of what we
need to know too. Get the crew,

803
00:51:02,870 --> 00:51:05,960
a crew to Mars to support
them on the surface.

804
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:10,880
It's just going to be really expensive.
And to do that you need,

805
00:51:10,970 --> 00:51:13,100
you know,
representatives in government that are,

806
00:51:13,700 --> 00:51:17,400
that are science minded people
that believe in science. Um,

807
00:51:17,990 --> 00:51:22,460
we don't have enough of that in
the United States. So, um, I think,

808
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:26,960
uh,
US getting to Mars is doable.

809
00:51:26,961 --> 00:51:30,740
I think it's doable today, but I don't
think it's going to happen anytime soon.

810
00:51:31,490 --> 00:51:34,160
Um, because at least in
the u s government, I mean,

811
00:51:34,550 --> 00:51:39,550
my concern is less about going to Mars
than it is about members of Congress,

812
00:51:40,521 --> 00:51:44,510
not believing that 97% of the experts,
scientists,

813
00:51:45,190 --> 00:51:45,770
um,

814
00:51:45,770 --> 00:51:50,770
are correct when they say
we are responsible for in
some ways responsible for

815
00:51:51,231 --> 00:51:54,170
climate change. That's a bigger
concern of mine. You know,

816
00:51:54,171 --> 00:51:57,280
when you have people that are not,
uh,

817
00:51:57,530 --> 00:52:00,260
don't come from a technical
background and can say,

818
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:03,170
I disagree with all these experts.
I mean that's,

819
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:08,620
that's arrogance to an amazing degree
that we have to get past that before we

820
00:52:10,461 --> 00:52:12,440
can do anything like
going to Mars someday.

821
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:17,790
Do you think that it's, I, I
have one more question on them.

822
00:52:17,850 --> 00:52:21,360
Commercial space travel so we can
kind of virgin galactic and space x,

823
00:52:21,780 --> 00:52:24,960
the space toys and seems
to be inching ever closer.

824
00:52:25,740 --> 00:52:28,770
Do you think that whatever would use
the whisk enough that that will happen?

825
00:52:28,771 --> 00:52:30,800
You talk about the one in 70 odds,
you know,

826
00:52:30,810 --> 00:52:34,560
do you think that's where the risk
lies? Absolutely. You know, absolutely.

827
00:52:34,561 --> 00:52:37,220
I think we are on a cusp
of, of uh, you know,

828
00:52:37,390 --> 00:52:40,800
technological advances that uh,
you know,

829
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:45,180
whether it's in space flight
or self driving vehicles,

830
00:52:45,181 --> 00:52:49,470
self piloted cars. I think, you know,
we're kind of getting into a revolution,

831
00:52:49,471 --> 00:52:52,050
you know, certainly with space flight,
you know, it's going to be risky.

832
00:52:52,051 --> 00:52:56,400
People will die just like in the
early days of aviation. But, you know,

833
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:58,920
hopefully within our lifetimes
you're gonna be able to, you know,

834
00:52:59,010 --> 00:53:04,010
hop on a rocket powered
airplane or whatever you want
to call it and be a in New

835
00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:06,760
York in 30 minutes,
which would be really cute.

836
00:53:06,770 --> 00:53:10,410
Would you be fest fest in line for that?
Uh, it depends on how much they paid me.

837
00:53:10,470 --> 00:53:14,170
Okay. Yeah. Let's take one more question.

838
00:53:14,171 --> 00:53:16,440
I think there's one more question then
I want to just leave you with a final

839
00:53:16,441 --> 00:53:20,700
thought. Great. I'm not at
the back. Thank you. Um,

840
00:53:21,570 --> 00:53:22,650
so my question is like,

841
00:53:22,651 --> 00:53:27,651
thinking about your entire career from
first day at school to first time flying

842
00:53:27,751 --> 00:53:31,320
on your own first time in space,
doing a space walk,

843
00:53:31,650 --> 00:53:36,650
like what was the biggest
jump in scariness and did
the previous jumps help you

844
00:53:37,441 --> 00:53:41,150
with that? That's definitely
a career. Yeah, definitely.

845
00:53:41,151 --> 00:53:43,340
Building Block. I, you know,

846
00:53:43,341 --> 00:53:47,330
I would say the scariest thing I've ever
done is landing on an aircraft carrier

847
00:53:47,331 --> 00:53:51,950
at night. You know, half the time it's
terrifying. The other half is just scary.

848
00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:53,593
Um,

849
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:59,440
the most like holy shit moment though
would be the first time you fly in space

850
00:53:59,991 --> 00:54:04,100
in those solid rocket motors light and
you feel every pound of that 7 million

851
00:54:04,101 --> 00:54:07,370
pounds of thrust.
And that's more than a holy shit moment.

852
00:54:07,371 --> 00:54:12,371
That's like a holy something else
moment where it is so shocking that,

853
00:54:14,870 --> 00:54:18,170
and so surprising and so
unexpected that when I,

854
00:54:18,350 --> 00:54:22,550
I flew my first flight like three years
before my brother ever flew into space.

855
00:54:22,551 --> 00:54:26,060
So I had three years to explain to
him what that was going to be like.

856
00:54:26,660 --> 00:54:31,520
And he was a combat pilot for the
[inaudible] and the Gulf War test pilot,

857
00:54:31,850 --> 00:54:35,360
same astronaut class basically,
you know,

858
00:54:35,450 --> 00:54:37,040
same DNA is me.

859
00:54:37,730 --> 00:54:42,730
I tried to explain that to him when he
landed and the hatch opened and he came

860
00:54:43,131 --> 00:54:46,730
out of the shuttle. The first thing he
said to me, I was waiting right there.

861
00:54:46,731 --> 00:54:51,110
He said, I had no idea what that
was going to be like. None. I mean,

862
00:54:51,111 --> 00:54:54,110
that is how amazing.
Absolutely amazing it is.

863
00:54:56,180 --> 00:55:01,100
Thank you. So before we leave, yeah, fine.
I'd just like to leave you all with a,

864
00:55:01,101 --> 00:55:05,600
you know, one final thought on my, uh,
my experience in, in space and that is,

865
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:09,890
you know, when I was leaving the space
station, this is a space station.

866
00:55:09,891 --> 00:55:13,430
I spent 500 days of my
life on over three flights.

867
00:55:14,060 --> 00:55:16,550
I flew my first flight to humble.
It was a week.

868
00:55:17,090 --> 00:55:21,380
Second flight was two weeks,
third flight, 159 days.

869
00:55:21,750 --> 00:55:24,080
Fourth flight was 340.

870
00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:28,010
Some smart guy told me that's
a second order polynomial.

871
00:55:29,010 --> 00:55:32,780
If you graph it, if I fly in space
again, I don't really come back.

872
00:55:33,090 --> 00:55:35,270
It goes asymptotic almost.

873
00:55:36,260 --> 00:55:38,270
Maybe it's like a five
and a half year mission,

874
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:41,630
but I'm leaving the space station.
I'm looking at this thing out the window.

875
00:55:41,631 --> 00:55:44,630
What I can see from the little
window and them thinking, you know,

876
00:55:44,810 --> 00:55:49,810
we built this thing a million pounds
the size of a football field or pitch

877
00:55:50,660 --> 00:55:55,660
football pitch while flying around
the earth at 17,500 miles an hour in a

878
00:55:56,241 --> 00:55:57,074
vacuum,

879
00:55:57,440 --> 00:56:02,440
in extremes of temperatures of plus
minus 270 degrees built with this

880
00:56:02,931 --> 00:56:07,040
international partnership of 15
different countries, different cultures,

881
00:56:07,041 --> 00:56:10,340
different languages,
different technical ways of doing things,

882
00:56:11,210 --> 00:56:15,620
put together by astronauts and cosmonauts
in space in these difficult to work

883
00:56:15,621 --> 00:56:18,380
space suits,
connecting these modules,

884
00:56:18,381 --> 00:56:21,590
some of which had never touched each
other before on our first time they ever

885
00:56:21,591 --> 00:56:25,900
met was in space.
This is the hardest thing we've ever done.

886
00:56:27,010 --> 00:56:31,390
Absolutely convinced of it. Harder than
going to the moon and if we can do this,

887
00:56:31,391 --> 00:56:34,690
we can do anything. If we want
to go to Mars, we can go to Mars.

888
00:56:35,320 --> 00:56:38,950
We want to cure cancer and put the
resources behind it. We can cure cancer.

889
00:56:39,370 --> 00:56:43,630
We want to fix our problems with the
environment. Challenges in my country,

890
00:56:43,631 --> 00:56:45,430
in the United States,
which there are many.

891
00:56:45,550 --> 00:56:50,550
I think they are all solvable challenges
you guys have in your industry,

892
00:56:51,010 --> 00:56:55,090
in your country here,
or wherever you may come from.

893
00:56:55,420 --> 00:57:00,400
I was absolutely inspired after spending
a year in space that if we can dream it,

894
00:57:00,940 --> 00:57:03,680
we can do it. Thank you very much, ladies
and gentlemen. It's called [inaudible].

895
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:08,850
[inaudible].
