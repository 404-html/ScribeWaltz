1
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:09,000
Miami. Alec is an actress,
writer and neuroscientist.

2
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:13,260
Her official bio says that she's best
known as Amy Farrah Fowler on the Big Bang

3
00:00:13,261 --> 00:00:18,180
theory. But I hope it's okay if I say
that for some of us it's blossom. Yes.

4
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:22,360
I'm obviously the blossom demographic.
Oh, I appreciate that. Um,

5
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:27,440
she is the author of beyond the sling
and Mimes Vegan table and her latest book

6
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:30,360
is girling up.
Please welcome my and Galic.

7
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:37,000
Thank you so much for joining us.
Thanks for having me. Horse. Um,

8
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:40,390
so to start things off,
the book is called girling up.

9
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:45,100
And the subtitle of the book is how
to be strong, smart, and spectacular.

10
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:47,140
Why those three qualities?

11
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:52,260
So the book is, um, is
written for girls 10 to 18,

12
00:00:52,261 --> 00:00:57,261
and anyone who ever was a girl tend
to 18 or knows a girl 10 to 18.

13
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:02,820
Um, and we, we wanted a subtitle
cause it's fun to have one,

14
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:06,540
you know, and um, there's a
reason that it's not, you know,

15
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:11,370
how to be saucy, Sassy and sexy.
Um, the, the qualities that,

16
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:16,140
that I'm trying to support
and give a voice to or those,

17
00:01:16,141 --> 00:01:18,660
you know,
of strength and intelligence and you know,

18
00:01:18,661 --> 00:01:21,420
sort of m and a whimsical,

19
00:01:21,421 --> 00:01:24,300
eccentric notion of being spectacular,

20
00:01:24,301 --> 00:01:28,740
which can be different things
for different girls. Um,
but also kind of, you know,

21
00:01:28,741 --> 00:01:33,060
to speak to that as well. When we first
saw ideas for, for covers, you know,

22
00:01:33,061 --> 00:01:37,140
they kind of wanted to do like, like, Ooh,
here's my, I'm thinking, you know, like,

23
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:40,650
like pretty headshot with
glasses and you know, um, those,

24
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:44,370
those were lovely photos.
But, um, I really said no,

25
00:01:44,371 --> 00:01:47,280
I want it to look like
more my personality.

26
00:01:47,281 --> 00:01:51,000
Like I want to be in a cape and
converse like, so there you go.

27
00:01:51,001 --> 00:01:54,360
I'm in a cave with converse
and um, yeah, I mean,

28
00:01:54,361 --> 00:01:58,290
we really wanted it to feel not
like a feminine, but you know,

29
00:01:58,291 --> 00:02:00,480
I specifically said like,
it doesn't have to be pink.

30
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:03,930
There's nothing biological about females
that makes us want the color pink.

31
00:02:03,931 --> 00:02:08,000
I actually never liked the color pink and
still don't. So, um, I, I like that it's,

32
00:02:08,001 --> 00:02:11,160
it's kind of bold and it's quirky.
And you know, we have some,

33
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:13,710
some sciency symbols and um,
yeah,

34
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:18,060
it kind of feels appropriate for strength
and smartness and spectacularness.

35
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:18,930
Yeah.

36
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:23,930
What inspired you to write a book for
girls and people who know them and have

37
00:02:24,451 --> 00:02:26,430
been them? Um, you know,

38
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:29,610
it's funny because the three
books that I have written,

39
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:34,070
I was not inspired to write them.
I was, um, I was approached and,

40
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:37,710
and um, this isn't just like people,
you know, being nice to celebrities.

41
00:02:37,711 --> 00:02:40,980
Like can you should write a book. Like
I was specifically approached, like,

42
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:45,740
will you write this book? And I've
been asked to put my face on, um,

43
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:50,640
several books. Um, I don't want many,
several, I don't know my book agents here,

44
00:02:50,641 --> 00:02:53,610
so I can't lie. Um, but I
have enough books of like,

45
00:02:53,611 --> 00:02:57,570
will you be the face of this science
book for Girls? And you know,

46
00:02:57,571 --> 00:03:01,700
it didn't really feel right because
science is super broad and um, you know,

47
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,400
I know how people feel
about celebrity books.

48
00:03:03,401 --> 00:03:06,670
I totally do because I feel that way too.
You know, like did they really write it?

49
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:10,440
Is it authentic? Like, is it really
going to be meaningful? And, um,

50
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:11,960
this book came about because,

51
00:03:11,961 --> 00:03:16,780
so I have a website called Grok nation
and I write essays about all sorts of

52
00:03:16,781 --> 00:03:17,170
things.

53
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:19,840
And one of the things I wrote about was
there was an episode of Big Bang Theory

54
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:22,810
where Sheldon and Amy have
coitus for the first time.

55
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:27,430
And I wrote an article
about what it was like to,

56
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:30,430
to not only play a late
bloomer on television,

57
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:33,730
but to be a late bloomer in
real life and how, you know,

58
00:03:33,731 --> 00:03:37,240
both Jim and I kind of felt
like, gosh, this is a really
intimate moment, you know,

59
00:03:37,241 --> 00:03:41,050
that we're sharing with potentially
millions of people. And I just wrote,

60
00:03:41,051 --> 00:03:44,320
you know, kind of a thoughtful
nerdy essay about, um, you know,

61
00:03:44,321 --> 00:03:48,430
some of that conflict of boundaries and
where my intimate brain ends and where

62
00:03:48,431 --> 00:03:52,240
this character's begins. And Jill
Santa's Polo, who's an editor at Penguin,

63
00:03:52,241 --> 00:03:56,080
reached out to me and she said, I saw
your article and Grok nation and I would,

64
00:03:56,350 --> 00:04:00,670
I would like you to write a book with
this kind of voice that has an ocean of

65
00:04:00,671 --> 00:04:05,050
modesty without being religious or
political. Um, and I said, well,

66
00:04:05,051 --> 00:04:08,140
that's very kind, but, um, can we do more?

67
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:11,260
And so I took my inspiration
actually from Madeley Angier,

68
00:04:11,261 --> 00:04:12,910
who's a science writer
for the New York Times.

69
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:17,050
And she wrote a book called woman and
intimate geography. And what it was,

70
00:04:17,051 --> 00:04:22,051
was actually a kind of cross species
comparison of how other mammals and other

71
00:04:23,381 --> 00:04:25,210
animals do things versus how women do.

72
00:04:25,211 --> 00:04:30,070
But it really was a full geography of
being a woman. And so I said to Jill,

73
00:04:30,071 --> 00:04:34,270
what if I basically did a version of
that about the full female experience?

74
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,490
And instead of using
other species as examples,

75
00:04:36,491 --> 00:04:40,630
I use other cultures and a lot of places.
And because I'm trained as a scientist,

76
00:04:40,631 --> 00:04:41,950
I kind of go from,
you know,

77
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:46,390
chromosomes and hormones through sex
and dating to how our brains learn,

78
00:04:46,391 --> 00:04:49,710
how our bodies get fed and nurtured.
Um,

79
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:54,190
and because it is a book
in the 21st century, how we
deal with difficult things.

80
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:58,930
Um, mental health issues,
eating disorders, depression,
um, abuse, things like that.

81
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:02,350
Uh, and then the final chapter is like
how we make a difference in the world and

82
00:05:02,351 --> 00:05:06,510
encouraging young girls, um, to, to
think in an age appropriate way. Um,

83
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:10,540
no one ever told me to do any of these
things is also really why I decided that

84
00:05:10,541 --> 00:05:11,410
I should write this book.

85
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:15,040
My mom didn't really talk to me about
any of this stuff. Um, body stuff,

86
00:05:15,041 --> 00:05:15,701
anything like that.

87
00:05:15,701 --> 00:05:20,020
My mom came from a very conservative
religious household and um, yeah,

88
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:23,410
just these things weren't talked about
and I wished someone had talked to me

89
00:05:23,411 --> 00:05:24,640
about all of these things.

90
00:05:24,641 --> 00:05:27,760
So I wrote a book so that other
girls can hear about these things.

91
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:32,570
Yeah. And, and like you said, it
does, it covers a ton. Yeah. I,

92
00:05:32,571 --> 00:05:34,260
I'm curious now you said no one's really,

93
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:36,630
no one ever really talked to you
about this stuff when you were a kid.

94
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:39,660
If you could give this book
to like 12 year old Miami,

95
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:42,300
what chapter would you point her to first?

96
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:47,550
Um, well, you know, there's a reason I put
the chapters in the order that I did. Um,

97
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:50,760
you know, I think starting
with chapter one is a good
place, but, you know, there's,

98
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:55,000
there's a lot or I guess was a
lot in their most, oh, what did,

99
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:56,810
what did she need most?
Uh,

100
00:05:57,420 --> 00:06:00,000
it feels like it's something my
therapist would ask me. Sorry,

101
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,380
what 12 year old Maya I'm needed most.
Um,

102
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:06,290
honestly I think that the
chapter about intimacy,

103
00:06:06,291 --> 00:06:08,030
which obviously include sex and dating,

104
00:06:08,031 --> 00:06:11,420
which I was not ready to think
about even at 16 or 17. Uh,

105
00:06:11,421 --> 00:06:14,660
but some of the stuff about sort of the
way that we form intimate relationships

106
00:06:14,661 --> 00:06:18,290
with other people even that are not
romantic would have been helpful. Um,

107
00:06:18,291 --> 00:06:22,850
you know, I included a section about how
to tell if someone is not a good friend.

108
00:06:22,851 --> 00:06:26,180
Yeah.
And literally no one ever said that to me.

109
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:29,240
It was just like I'd come home crying
and like she said this about me and my

110
00:06:29,241 --> 00:06:31,700
mother would be like, I don't know
what to do. Don't be friends with them,

111
00:06:31,701 --> 00:06:33,590
you know?
And so it really like,

112
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:37,970
it occurred to me what if
we lay out guidelines for
how people should treat each

113
00:06:37,971 --> 00:06:40,220
other, you know, and the
expectations you can have.

114
00:06:40,221 --> 00:06:42,620
And of course it's not always going
to be like that. And I'm like,

115
00:06:42,621 --> 00:06:46,040
I already was the kid who, you know,
talk like a grownup when I was 12.

116
00:06:46,041 --> 00:06:49,160
It didn't make me very
popular. Um, but, but no,

117
00:06:49,161 --> 00:06:51,960
I think that that chapter ultimately
would have been very helpful in,

118
00:06:51,961 --> 00:06:55,820
in terms of all kinds of, um, you
know, intimacy, because intimacy is,

119
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:58,760
those are the relationships we have
with our family and with our friends.

120
00:06:58,761 --> 00:07:03,600
It's not just the scary ones. Yeah. Sorry.
Still even thinking of them as the scan.

121
00:07:03,601 --> 00:07:06,280
Yeah, exactly. Yeah. I'm 41
and it's still scary. Yeah.

122
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:11,930
You, uh, you know, talking about, um,

123
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:14,540
the,
the fact that when you were 12,

124
00:07:14,541 --> 00:07:17,150
you were already sort of
talking like an adult, an adult.

125
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:22,900
What was it like writing a book with
all of this really big subject matter,

126
00:07:22,971 --> 00:07:26,270
including, you know, science and
psychology and all of this stuff.

127
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:27,740
Aiming it at children.

128
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:32,210
Yeah. I should also point out, um,
I'd like to apologize to my publicist,

129
00:07:32,211 --> 00:07:32,901
Heather bezerk.
Oh,

130
00:07:32,901 --> 00:07:35,810
I forgot to take the bandaids off
my pinky toes and they are showing.

131
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:39,190
So I wouldn't want anyone to look and say
like, Haha, mine was wearing bandaids.

132
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:43,220
I was wearing very high, high heels before
and my toes were hurting. And Heather,

133
00:07:43,221 --> 00:07:45,020
I'll take off the bat how to
wear high heels or something.

134
00:07:45,021 --> 00:07:48,890
I understand like there are
bandaids on my pinky does. Um,

135
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:51,350
but I didn't want someone to think
she doesn't know there's bandage.

136
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:56,120
I know it's real. It's real life.
It's, this is totally worth, yeah.

137
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:59,660
Very real right now. Um, how did it
feel? It was difficult. You know,

138
00:07:59,661 --> 00:08:02,540
I'm a person who loves words.
I love language.

139
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:07,430
I remember many s a t words
and use them often. And, uh,

140
00:08:07,431 --> 00:08:10,520
I really had to write a book without
my full vocabulary, you know,

141
00:08:10,521 --> 00:08:12,020
I was allowed to use or I was,

142
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:16,430
I needed to use by full intellectual
and emotional vocabulary,

143
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:19,490
but I had to do it with
words that, um, yeah,

144
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:24,290
that would make sense for a 10 to 18 year
old audience. And, um, and in addition,

145
00:08:24,291 --> 00:08:24,471
you know,

146
00:08:24,471 --> 00:08:27,650
you can't just say that things are great
over and over because you can't use all

147
00:08:27,651 --> 00:08:30,980
of your other adjectives that can't
be like, you know, everything's great,

148
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:33,650
the brain's great, you know,
hormones are great. Like, you know,

149
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:35,570
you have to find other
ways to explain things.

150
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:39,970
My 11 year old son was my first
kind of proper proofreader and, uh,

151
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:42,370
he didn't like chapter one at all because
there are a lot of diagrams of the

152
00:08:42,371 --> 00:08:46,310
woman's body. He wasn't
interested in that at all. Uh,

153
00:08:46,311 --> 00:08:48,950
so that was not his favorite
chapter. But, um, you know,

154
00:08:48,951 --> 00:08:51,860
I really want to just to know from him,
like, does it flow? Is it interesting?

155
00:08:51,861 --> 00:08:54,570
Do I sound like a scolding mom? And
he's like, you are a scolding mom.

156
00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:58,440
But objectively speaking,
he said, um, you know,

157
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:01,460
it felt right to him and there were
things that were interesting. Um,

158
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:05,690
not those diagrams. Right?
Yeah. Right. And you have, you
have two sons, right? Yeah.

159
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:07,860
Eight and 11.
Those aren't their names,

160
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:09,930
although many Hollywood people name
their children, things like that.

161
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,950
Can you talk a little bit about the,

162
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:19,130
the decision to write a book for
girls while you have sons? Are there,

163
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:22,070
I'm not saying like, why didn't you write
it up for your own? Believe me, I've,

164
00:09:22,071 --> 00:09:26,690
I've been out, I'm not, I'm
more interested in just,
you know, raising sons.

165
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:31,190
There are also conversations that you
must have to have with them about girls

166
00:09:31,191 --> 00:09:35,090
and their own bodies.
Sure. Growing up as boys,

167
00:09:35,091 --> 00:09:37,320
I'm just curious how you've
been thinking about that. I've,

168
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,160
I've gotten,

169
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:42,510
I've gotten this question asked in many
productive ways and several unproductive

170
00:09:42,511 --> 00:09:44,900
ways, um, you know, and,

171
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:49,290
and in the world of social media,
you see all sorts of questions.

172
00:09:49,291 --> 00:09:52,650
Like literally,
why would you write a book for girls?

173
00:09:52,651 --> 00:09:56,790
Why not for boys to which
I respond? Well, I did,

174
00:09:56,791 --> 00:10:01,740
I responded to that comment. Um, you know,
or what gives you the authority? I said,

175
00:10:01,741 --> 00:10:04,950
well, I'm a female. I, you know,
that's like, that's where we'll start.

176
00:10:04,951 --> 00:10:09,210
I was a girl and now I'm
a woman. Um, I chose to,

177
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:12,600
to write this book largely because of,
you know,

178
00:10:12,601 --> 00:10:17,160
Jill approaching me about
kind the specific voice
about being a female and the

179
00:10:17,161 --> 00:10:19,230
fact that I grew up in the limelight,
you know,

180
00:10:19,231 --> 00:10:23,910
I was on blossom from the time I was 14
to 19 and I started acting when I was 11.

181
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:27,290
So, you know, I, I grew up in
some very critical years, um,

182
00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:29,190
really in the public eye.

183
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:32,070
And although standards for women were
different then and there wasn't social

184
00:10:32,071 --> 00:10:33,620
media and there wasn't,
you know, kind of the,

185
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:36,420
the publicity machine directed
around women in particular,

186
00:10:36,421 --> 00:10:40,410
I think that puts a lot of pressure on us.
Um, I definitely had a notion of being,

187
00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:42,450
you know, on display, you know,

188
00:10:42,451 --> 00:10:46,110
as a woman in a culture that I
don't always find friendly to women.

189
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:50,040
So that I think was, you know, kind
of part of the perspective that I,

190
00:10:50,041 --> 00:10:53,400
that I wanted to bring to
girling up. And, you know,

191
00:10:53,401 --> 00:10:56,700
the fact is I dedicated this book
to my boys because you don't really,

192
00:10:56,701 --> 00:11:01,701
everything I do is as their mother and
they will meet women in their lives who,

193
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:02,780
you know,

194
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:07,080
hopefully if they haven't read this book
will have read other books that empower

195
00:11:07,081 --> 00:11:10,020
them and make them
believe in the values of,

196
00:11:10,021 --> 00:11:13,800
of knowing more about yourself and making
an impact in the world. And, you know,

197
00:11:13,801 --> 00:11:17,790
people get very, um, certain
people get very uppity, you know,

198
00:11:17,791 --> 00:11:21,000
when they hear that I'm a feminist or
that I'm raising feminist children,

199
00:11:21,001 --> 00:11:25,080
you know, and um, you know, I'm, I'm
not a person who hates men actually.

200
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:28,760
I quite like men. And,
um, I, I'm not raising my,

201
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:32,040
my boys to be afraid of masculinity.
I mean,

202
00:11:32,041 --> 00:11:34,800
I think a lot of people just literally
don't know the definition that, you know,

203
00:11:34,801 --> 00:11:35,700
feminism is a,

204
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:39,420
is a movement that believes in a unique
role of women to break the bonds of race,

205
00:11:39,421 --> 00:11:44,100
class and gender. And, um, my sons
understand that. And, um, there,

206
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:48,450
there is information in this book about
boys' bodies as well as girls bodies and

207
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,810
much of what is in this book applies
to males as well as females. So yeah,

208
00:11:51,811 --> 00:11:54,350
I speak to my children about hormones.
Um,

209
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:57,890
they know about gender fluidity because
they hear it in the news and, uh,

210
00:11:57,990 --> 00:12:00,760
they just, you know, we just used to
call it like Mama's boyish, you know,

211
00:12:00,761 --> 00:12:03,340
like why does Mama likes sports cars
and data doesn't, you know, data lakes,

212
00:12:03,341 --> 00:12:06,280
musical theater just cause, you
know, cause everybody's different.

213
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:10,480
So they've already had a lot of these
conversations. But, you know, I think,

214
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:15,010
I think it's okay for us to acknowledge
that, you know, for most of human history,

215
00:12:15,011 --> 00:12:17,800
women have been excluded from
a lot of the workplace, um,

216
00:12:17,801 --> 00:12:21,340
and have been denied a lot
of the rights that men had.

217
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:25,750
And it's okay to say that we
want to have this kind of book.

218
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:28,780
There are books for boys,
there will continue to be books for boys.

219
00:12:28,781 --> 00:12:32,190
Men have written most of the
books in human history. Uh,

220
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:35,460
if you kind of look at like a bell
curve of it, you know, um, and,

221
00:12:35,461 --> 00:12:39,060
and I really feel like it's totally
okay to also acknowledge that, you know,

222
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:42,640
the male body is very different than the
female body and the fact that, you know,

223
00:12:42,641 --> 00:12:46,870
the male genitalia is on the outside
is a lot more informative than women's

224
00:12:46,871 --> 00:12:48,670
bodies where everything
is, you know, protected.

225
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:53,320
And so there's a lot to know about
what's going on in there and as well of

226
00:12:53,321 --> 00:12:56,410
course there are exceptions to all of
these things, but women are, you know,

227
00:12:56,411 --> 00:13:01,411
a very verbal and social creature and
there's a lot that we're not encouraged to

228
00:13:01,811 --> 00:13:05,770
kind of talk about and bring out. And I
think men are seeing that too. You know,

229
00:13:05,771 --> 00:13:09,640
men can be emotional and we need to
talk about all those things, but I also,

230
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:13,480
you know, I don't feel like one should
have to defend, you know, a special book,

231
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:17,460
um, for girls. Yeah. I feel
like we're in a safe place here.

232
00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:20,210
I feel like not being attacked yet yet,
yet.

233
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:25,890
Just turn the page questions. Um, so you,

234
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:29,790
you know, you have, you've
written three books,

235
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:33,870
you write essays and articles and all
sorts of stuff and you're very outspoken

236
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:38,880
as we've just seen with your,
oh, that was like a warm up.

237
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:44,910
Um, I actually, I read in
another interview with you
that you were saying that,

238
00:13:44,911 --> 00:13:47,790
you know, growing up Jewish, you were
like raised in an argumentative tradition.

239
00:13:47,791 --> 00:13:50,670
I was like, yes, yes. I feel that
I'll, if I want to get fancy,

240
00:13:50,671 --> 00:13:53,010
you can call it like the
dialectic tradition, but you know,

241
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:56,350
that's only in philosophy class. So they
call us like being Jewish, right? Yeah.

242
00:13:57,420 --> 00:14:00,520
When you're out to dinner with your family
over there. Right, exactly. Yeah. Um,

243
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:04,520
but you do, you have a very strong
and specific worldview and you know,

244
00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:09,020
you live that in your, all of your
life choices, everything's fine. Okay.

245
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,900
Okay. Um, you know, the,

246
00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:14,730
your Jewish faith and being
vegan and all of this stuff.

247
00:14:14,731 --> 00:14:19,260
And I'm curious how you approached
writing a book that would be inviting and

248
00:14:19,261 --> 00:14:23,760
accessible and helpful to girls from a
wide range of backgrounds and have their

249
00:14:23,761 --> 00:14:26,520
own beliefs and their family's beliefs
while still being true to your own.

250
00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:31,540
Yeah, I mean, this is a great question
because it's a great challenge, you know,

251
00:14:31,541 --> 00:14:35,320
when, when writing this kind of thing,
especially because, you know, I was,

252
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:39,910
I was approached really because Jill,
you know, this editor at Penguin,

253
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:43,600
because Jill really liked
this voice that I had,

254
00:14:43,601 --> 00:14:45,250
which is really one of
social conservatism,

255
00:14:45,251 --> 00:14:48,130
which you can be socially conservative
even if you're a bleeding heart liberal.

256
00:14:48,131 --> 00:14:52,130
I promise. It's like, here
I am. Um, but, um, you know,

257
00:14:52,131 --> 00:14:55,220
I wanted to make sure that it didn't
feel like a part is in book. You know,

258
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,990
I happen to believe in,
in a certain kind of,

259
00:14:57,991 --> 00:15:01,250
of politics and I happen to believe
in a certain religious tradition.

260
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:05,660
And you know, one of the ways that I
talk about that historically people cope,

261
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:09,890
you know, in the chapter on how we
cope is by you know, structured,

262
00:15:09,891 --> 00:15:12,920
organized activities,
some of which are religious in nature.

263
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:17,060
But I really tried to kind of at
every turn I'm saying, you know,

264
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:18,680
even if this doesn't work for you,

265
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:22,520
here are some of the advantages of people
congregating regularly in a community

266
00:15:22,521 --> 00:15:24,320
setting. Um, just to again,

267
00:15:24,321 --> 00:15:28,910
sort of give information that can then
be used to make decisions. And I think,

268
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,580
you know, a lot of times you get
knee jerk reactions or you know,

269
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:34,850
I responded in a knee jerk fashion
really for much of these years.

270
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,200
So I think being presented lots of
different options is healthy and also

271
00:15:39,201 --> 00:15:43,790
presenting information in a way that
there are many options is helpful. Um,

272
00:15:43,791 --> 00:15:46,570
but for me, you know, in the,
in the chapter on, you know,

273
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:49,550
basically in nutrition and what we eat
and how our body is fueled by that.

274
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:54,290
I do talk about my, my personal
choices. Yes, I happen to be Vegan,

275
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:56,690
but I make it really clear
and it's really true.

276
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:59,450
I know that being Vegan is
not for everyone. You know,

277
00:15:59,451 --> 00:16:03,170
we all know that every major medical
organization says we all should eat less

278
00:16:03,171 --> 00:16:06,760
processed foods and less meat and
less animal byproducts. Um, but,

279
00:16:06,761 --> 00:16:08,720
but I didn't want that to
be an agenda of the book.

280
00:16:08,721 --> 00:16:11,510
And I wrote a Vegan cookbook for God's
sake. Like if you want an agenda book,

281
00:16:11,511 --> 00:16:16,110
like that's it, you know.
Um, but I do think, you know,
it's also important, you know,

282
00:16:16,111 --> 00:16:19,160
to look at all,
all aspects of these kinds of angles.

283
00:16:19,161 --> 00:16:22,910
And I did talk about how
many young girls and yes,

284
00:16:22,911 --> 00:16:26,760
some young boys as well, but
many young girls, um, are, uh,

285
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:30,080
adopting a vegetarian or Vegan
diet as a way to lose weight.

286
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:32,930
And that's actually not, you
know, the purpose. I mean, yes,

287
00:16:32,931 --> 00:16:35,390
some people do tend to lose weight.
It's,

288
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:38,360
you can also gain weight as
a vegetarian or a Vegan. Um,

289
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:41,750
but I made sure to also point to some
of the larger issues because you know,

290
00:16:41,751 --> 00:16:42,411
those,
again,

291
00:16:42,411 --> 00:16:46,070
those are things that weren't really
talked about and it is important for us to

292
00:16:46,071 --> 00:16:49,250
talk about them. And it's, you know, the
kind of thing that feels Yucky, you know,

293
00:16:49,251 --> 00:16:53,930
when you hear of, you know, a friend's
daughter or a niece or whatever who,

294
00:16:53,931 --> 00:16:57,170
you know, is having eating
problems and it's being couched in,

295
00:16:57,171 --> 00:16:59,720
in eating preferences.
Those are complicated things.

296
00:16:59,721 --> 00:17:04,640
But I really think it's healthy to get
it out there. I hope that it is. Yeah.

297
00:17:04,641 --> 00:17:07,460
And it's, it's so tricky to talk
about because on the one hand,

298
00:17:08,090 --> 00:17:12,320
any kind of restrictive eating can be
a signal of something raised kosher.

299
00:17:12,321 --> 00:17:16,220
So it's like, you know, we have thousands
of years of restrictions, but I,

300
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:18,680
for like when a young girl
starts taking that on,

301
00:17:18,681 --> 00:17:22,250
it's tied in with all this other sort
of baggage, but it can also, you know,

302
00:17:22,251 --> 00:17:26,540
I know people who've started eating
vegetarian or Vegan for health or sort of

303
00:17:26,570 --> 00:17:29,570
vague restrictive reasons
and then along the way,

304
00:17:29,571 --> 00:17:33,740
like discover other reasons and sort of
like pack on that I suppose as you go.

305
00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:38,000
Yeah, that was kind of, that was my story
as well, so, yeah. But, um, back to the,

306
00:17:38,810 --> 00:17:42,440
I guess the sort of the conservatism
can be the idea of being sort of

307
00:17:42,441 --> 00:17:45,090
conservative while also
bleeding heart liberal. The,

308
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:50,250
you mentioned modesty earlier and one of
the things that really intrigued me in

309
00:17:50,251 --> 00:17:53,990
the book actually was your mention of
modesty in the acknowledgements. Um,

310
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:57,980
you think two women who I think
are both rabbis, right? Uh,

311
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:01,770
remind me I didn't write their names down.
Shall lead.

312
00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:06,840
When does she'll eat, wrote a return
to modesty. It was drag knowledge. Her,

313
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:11,820
hold on, hold on. This is fun. Tell us
who she is while I look this up. Uh,

314
00:18:11,821 --> 00:18:14,700
well when he shall lead, uh, is an
author who wrote, returned to modesty.

315
00:18:14,701 --> 00:18:18,870
She's not a rabbi, but she wrote
a book about sort of the, the,

316
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:23,650
the reclaiming that a lot of women are
doing, um, not necessarily in a, you know,

317
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:25,070
in a religious manner.
Um,

318
00:18:25,071 --> 00:18:29,100
but to reclaim the notions of having
choices about what they wear and how they

319
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,930
were, did you find it? I did find it.

320
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:34,470
So I think you mentioned as
mentioned in the chapter.

321
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:39,720
So here it was Aviva Colon, Alison
Joseph's. Both of whom are not rabbis.

322
00:18:39,810 --> 00:18:43,800
This is why I wasn't sounding familiar.
Um, yeah, Alison Joseph's is a,

323
00:18:43,801 --> 00:18:47,340
is an online presence. She goes by
June the city. She was actually,

324
00:18:47,341 --> 00:18:48,750
I met her through partners in Torah,

325
00:18:48,751 --> 00:18:52,500
which is a free organization that sets
you up with someone who can teach you

326
00:18:52,501 --> 00:18:56,130
really anything you want to know about
Judaism. And one of the main things that,

327
00:18:56,131 --> 00:18:58,830
and she's literally, I mean, I
don't want to say she's just a mom,

328
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:02,490
but she's not a a Jewish educational
professional. At that time,

329
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,620
she and I were both new moms.
Um,

330
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:07,410
she ended up kind of developing
an online presence and website,

331
00:19:07,411 --> 00:19:10,170
educating people about modern
orthodoxy. Um, but anyway,

332
00:19:10,171 --> 00:19:11,520
so that's who Alison Joseph says.

333
00:19:11,521 --> 00:19:15,960
And one of the things we studied through
partners in Torah was modesty and why

334
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:19,740
Jewish women have rules and what the
rules are for Jewish men of Eva coal is a

335
00:19:19,741 --> 00:19:22,520
[inaudible], which means
she's married to a rabbi. Um,

336
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:25,350
and she was the woman awkward.

337
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:28,320
She was the woman that I studied
with before I got married.

338
00:19:28,321 --> 00:19:33,300
So in traditional Jewish weddings,
um, this may sound strange. Um,

339
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:35,460
women typically study,
uh,

340
00:19:35,490 --> 00:19:38,790
things about being married with women.

341
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:41,850
And men typically study things
about being married with men.

342
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:44,670
And if you've ever heard of a
Mikvah, which is a ritual bath, um,

343
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:49,810
that is a spiritual and a
legal place that you immerse,

344
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:52,890
think of like a really holy
Jacuzzi. It's like that. Um,

345
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:57,240
I studied all of the rules. There are,
you know, thousands of years of tradition,

346
00:19:57,270 --> 00:20:02,190
um, surrounding the use of
that ritual and tradition.

347
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:06,250
And it was something I've written
about very publicly, um, because I,

348
00:20:06,251 --> 00:20:09,690
I found it very, um, very, um,

349
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:13,270
comforting to have that as a, as
a monthly ritual. Typically, um,

350
00:20:13,290 --> 00:20:16,540
Jewish women go after their
menstrual cycle ends. Um,

351
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:20,570
and it is a not because we're dirty
or horrible, which is, you know,

352
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:24,120
what a lot of people assume, but I
found it very empowering and you know,

353
00:20:24,121 --> 00:20:28,660
I do identify as a feminist who is part
of the structure of patriarchy, you know,

354
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:32,190
in that I am part of a, a Jewish
tradition, which is, you know,

355
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:37,080
patriarchal in its origins. Um, but
yeah, that was a lot cause everyone,

356
00:20:37,081 --> 00:20:40,500
okay. Like, I may have hurt someone. Okay.

357
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:46,640
So then you're like, what
do I ask next? I was just,

358
00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:47,620
I,

359
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:50,230
I'm going to continue the question
cause I'm sorry. That's it.

360
00:20:50,231 --> 00:20:53,820
I still have the question, which was,
um, you, so what you write and yes,

361
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:55,030
this is what it's like to date me.

362
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:58,990
This is literally this problem and
what just happened is what it's like.

363
00:20:58,991 --> 00:21:01,060
It's not a problem. Okay.
Thank you. Are we dating?

364
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:07,390
So the two women, I think two women
you think and you write that they, um,

365
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:10,120
they taught me the ways of decorum,

366
00:21:10,121 --> 00:21:13,510
modesty and grace in the ancient
origins of these gifts have increased my

367
00:21:13,511 --> 00:21:17,890
concept of worth dignity and the
divine ability to love and be loved.

368
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:21,430
I thought that was so lovely. It was
kind of lovely. I forgot that I wrote,

369
00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:25,480
can you talk a little bit
about what that means?

370
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:29,590
Ah, I think that, um, you know,

371
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:32,380
you pick like one of the
most intimate thank you.

372
00:21:32,410 --> 00:21:37,000
Besides my ex boyfriend and my ex husband
who are also thanked in there. Um, yeah,

373
00:21:37,001 --> 00:21:39,970
I think that for me, um, you know,

374
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:44,260
I came late to observance. Um,
I was not raised religious.

375
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:49,210
My mother was raised Orthodox and
very, very, I'm kind of old world.

376
00:21:49,211 --> 00:21:51,340
Her parents were immigrants.
She didn't speak English and her home,

377
00:21:51,341 --> 00:21:55,960
they only spoke Yiddish. So, um,
she kind of raised me reform,

378
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:59,940
um, meaning she didn't want
a lot of ritual. And, um,

379
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:02,410
when I was in college,
I took on more observance.

380
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:07,150
And one of the things that
was very empowering for me
was to meet women who did

381
00:22:07,151 --> 00:22:09,090
not feel oppressed.
Um,

382
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:13,870
and also women who didn't simply say like,
I'm part of the patriarchy,

383
00:22:13,871 --> 00:22:17,380
therefore I don't feel oppressed. These
were intelligent college educated women,

384
00:22:17,381 --> 00:22:19,720
which you don't have to be
going to college to be educated,

385
00:22:19,721 --> 00:22:23,470
but you know what I mean? This wasn't the
stereotype of like, the woman who went,

386
00:22:23,471 --> 00:22:26,530
you know, got married at 17 and
never saw the outside world.

387
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:29,830
These are women who had lived
in an integrated society, um,

388
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:32,590
and who were gorgeous,
um,

389
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:35,380
felt empowered in how
they presented themselves.

390
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:39,010
And I'm not going to pretend that there
are many women who want to be modest and

391
00:22:39,011 --> 00:22:41,110
still be attractive. Um, honestly,

392
00:22:41,111 --> 00:22:44,800
Alison dresses in clothing that I would
feel uncomfortable in because it's too

393
00:22:44,801 --> 00:22:45,850
tight, but it's very, you know,

394
00:22:45,851 --> 00:22:48,670
for her it's very modest than
it is modest by most standards.

395
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:53,890
But to meet women who had
fulfilling lives as women,

396
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:57,610
again within this kind of religious
structure was very comforting.

397
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:02,330
And I found that the rules
of, um, you know, uh,

398
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:07,060
it's, it's there, it's called
family purity. It sounds
better in Hebrew, I promise.

399
00:23:07,150 --> 00:23:10,780
Um, but I found that the,
the rules governing, um,

400
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:15,280
marriage and love and intimacy really
protected something that I believe is very

401
00:23:15,281 --> 00:23:19,630
sacred. And even though I'm divorced,
you know, I think that my, Mike,

402
00:23:19,631 --> 00:23:23,170
I think that my, my ex would agree,
like, um, there was a lot of,

403
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:26,380
there were a lot of healthy boundaries,
you know, in our relationship.

404
00:23:26,410 --> 00:23:30,610
And you know, when I think
about, you know, when I got
pregnant, it was, you know,

405
00:23:30,611 --> 00:23:35,180
after visiting a spiritual ritual bath
where I had like a mystical, you know,

406
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,590
experience of this notion of
you can be reborn, you know, by,

407
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:42,310
by immersing and having this
experience, um, that's really, you know,

408
00:23:42,311 --> 00:23:43,780
that's pleasant and it's bitter sweet.

409
00:23:43,781 --> 00:23:46,950
I don't do that anymore
because not married. Um,

410
00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:51,680
there are people who go to the ritual
bath, um, in other non traditional ways,

411
00:23:51,681 --> 00:23:54,170
but for the kind of
traditional person that I am,

412
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:57,890
it really felt like something sacred
in, in the context of my marriage. Um,

413
00:23:57,891 --> 00:24:01,310
and I credit those women with really
helping me find beauty in something that a

414
00:24:01,311 --> 00:24:03,560
lot of people consider just,
you know,

415
00:24:03,561 --> 00:24:07,100
kind of a knee jerk reaction like
that sexist. That's awful. Um,

416
00:24:07,101 --> 00:24:08,690
and I also feel like
there's so many things,

417
00:24:09,170 --> 00:24:11,600
not only in religion but in life as well.
You know,

418
00:24:11,601 --> 00:24:14,210
that it's easy to sort of dismiss
like that. But, um, you know,

419
00:24:14,211 --> 00:24:16,670
I chose to make a commitment
to get educated about it.

420
00:24:16,671 --> 00:24:19,580
And for me it was very rewarding. I know
not everyone would have that experience.

421
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:20,473
And that's fine too.

422
00:24:21,810 --> 00:24:24,050
Um, we're going to open it
up for questions in a minute.

423
00:24:24,051 --> 00:24:27,740
So if you have a question, please stand
by one of the microphones in the aisle.

424
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:31,350
Um, but before we go to that, so the,

425
00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:35,870
the book gives a lot of advice to
girls, suggestions, suggestions,

426
00:24:36,530 --> 00:24:40,160
some framework, some guidelines
if you want some ideas. Um,

427
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:43,880
are there any suggestions
then that you would,

428
00:24:43,970 --> 00:24:48,620
since you've spent so much time sort of
getting into the minds of girls between

429
00:24:48,621 --> 00:24:50,540
10 and 18 and thinking about
what they're going through,

430
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:55,070
are there any suggestions that you
would offer to the parents of girls?

431
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:59,960
Don't let your children have phones
or leave the house. Does that work?

432
00:25:00,110 --> 00:25:03,800
That's kind of what to know. Light does it
to know, I know that it doesn't. Um, no,

433
00:25:03,801 --> 00:25:07,460
I think that, well, I know that,
you know, for me as a parent,

434
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:12,230
I think whether I had boys or had
girls, I do put a lot. And so,

435
00:25:12,231 --> 00:25:15,040
so does my ax. We do put a lot of, um,

436
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:18,800
structure and boundaries around the kind
of information are children have access

437
00:25:18,801 --> 00:25:23,450
to and, um, what, what and, and
knowing what they're doing. And for us,

438
00:25:23,451 --> 00:25:27,590
um, for us that's comforting.
I think that a lot of parents,

439
00:25:27,650 --> 00:25:30,980
especially parents who are younger than
I am, you know, cause I, I could easily,

440
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:33,470
well I'm 41 so do the math,
you know,

441
00:25:33,471 --> 00:25:37,630
I could easily easily have a 20
year old or older. Um, you know,

442
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:41,310
I think a lot of parents in that
sort of middle generation, um,

443
00:25:41,450 --> 00:25:45,770
are sometimes nervous to, to not be
friendly or be friends with their kid.

444
00:25:45,770 --> 00:25:48,830
And I think there's a lot of benefit to
that, you know, and you know, I sort of,

445
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:50,510
I was raised in like a,
you know,

446
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:54,820
I was raised in a house where I
didn't have a lot of voice. Um, um,

447
00:25:54,950 --> 00:25:59,000
because that's how people raise children
back then. So I think that there's,

448
00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:03,620
there's something in between that I would
hope people find. But that being said,

449
00:26:03,621 --> 00:26:08,600
I think it's okay to say no,
and I think it's okay to say,

450
00:26:08,690 --> 00:26:12,740
um, yeah, you're, you're not ready
for a phone, which, you know,

451
00:26:12,741 --> 00:26:16,250
my 11 year old is stomping his
foot every other day at us. Um,

452
00:26:16,430 --> 00:26:20,320
but I do think it's okay to
say, I need your passwords. Um,

453
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:24,350
what are you doing on the computer?
What are you watching? Uh, and,

454
00:26:24,351 --> 00:26:28,430
and I also think we shouldn't
be afraid to upset children. Um,

455
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:30,770
because a lot of times I think I,

456
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:34,130
I'm sometimes afraid to make decisions
because I'm afraid, you know,

457
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:37,580
that they'll feel controlled or
there'll be mad at me, you know. Um,

458
00:26:37,670 --> 00:26:40,610
but I think it's very important
for parents to know that.

459
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:45,060
I hope that this book will kind of open
up conversations in terms of TV time and

460
00:26:45,061 --> 00:26:47,070
screen time and things like that.
Um,

461
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,260
and in terms of like the
sex and dating chapter,

462
00:26:49,261 --> 00:26:51,060
like that's going to really vary by kid.
You know,

463
00:26:51,061 --> 00:26:55,470
I wasn't ready to learn that kind of
information until much later on that,

464
00:26:55,920 --> 00:27:00,210
you know. Yeah. All right.

465
00:27:00,211 --> 00:27:03,840
We have a question over here.
Hi. Um, a couple of years ago,

466
00:27:03,841 --> 00:27:08,390
I read an article about pedophilia
culture and it talks about, um,

467
00:27:08,430 --> 00:27:11,550
things like resilient waxes
and calling women girls.

468
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:13,530
And at that time I made the choice,

469
00:27:13,531 --> 00:27:18,030
I am no longer going to call women girls
and maybe that shows a couple of years

470
00:27:18,030 --> 00:27:22,310
ago and it's, it's always this
conscious effort. And, um,

471
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:25,740
I've gotten comfortable with it myself
and I've gotten comfortable correcting

472
00:27:25,741 --> 00:27:30,030
someone when they refer to me as a girl,
you know, Google girl, Bianca, you know,

473
00:27:30,031 --> 00:27:33,030
and I could get that. I'm like,
no Google woman. Um, but what,

474
00:27:33,031 --> 00:27:36,840
I'm not making an alliteration issue.
I defend your right to correct,

475
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:41,520
not yet comfortable doing is correcting
that people when they refer to other

476
00:27:41,521 --> 00:27:46,140
women as girls. And so you just posted a
video much more fun on, on social media,

477
00:27:46,141 --> 00:27:49,950
which I really, really appreciated. Um,
and I hear this happening all the time.

478
00:27:49,951 --> 00:27:53,910
I hear my colleagues referring
to other Google women as girls.

479
00:27:54,090 --> 00:27:58,110
I hear them referring to clients
or agency partners as girls.

480
00:27:58,111 --> 00:28:01,620
And it bugs me, but I don't, I
don't know how to address it.

481
00:28:01,621 --> 00:28:05,490
And so I have been saying nothing and I
would like to say something and I would

482
00:28:05,491 --> 00:28:07,680
like your thoughts on how to address it.
Um,

483
00:28:07,710 --> 00:28:09,550
I didn't know where you were
going to go with that question.

484
00:28:09,551 --> 00:28:13,280
That I am much more relaxed right
now than it was 30 seconds ago.

485
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:20,880
Um, so uh, Bianca was that your name?
Yes. What beyond cause referring to um,

486
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:25,630
his eye. So I make youtube
videos and um, you know, there's,

487
00:28:25,650 --> 00:28:28,730
there's not necessarily a rhyme or
reason as to why something goes viral,

488
00:28:28,731 --> 00:28:30,470
but we did have a video go
viral for the first time.

489
00:28:30,471 --> 00:28:33,080
I think it has 9.6 million
views or something.

490
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:36,440
And it was about why we
shouldn't call women girls. Um,

491
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:40,130
then I released science and religion
about sort of my lack of conflict they're

492
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:42,340
in and that went viral the next week.
We had like a big month, you know,

493
00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:43,543
it was a very big month.

494
00:28:43,790 --> 00:28:46,340
So it's funny because this is something
I've been ranting about since I'm like

495
00:28:46,341 --> 00:28:49,430
14 years old. Like this is just something
that's always really bothered me.

496
00:28:49,670 --> 00:28:53,270
And the video was originally
longer cause I got, believe me,

497
00:28:53,271 --> 00:28:56,480
I got a lot of comments if, why didn't
you talk about this? What about this?

498
00:28:56,481 --> 00:28:58,220
You know,
what about the south in Tennessee,

499
00:28:58,221 --> 00:29:00,380
there's a region where men are
called boys and like why, you know,

500
00:29:00,381 --> 00:29:04,100
like all these like specific anecdotal
exceptions that prove that I'm a horrible

501
00:29:04,101 --> 00:29:09,080
person. So anyway, but, um,
there are originally was,

502
00:29:09,081 --> 00:29:13,160
um, a part of that video that
talked about exceptions, um, in, in,

503
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:17,590
in intimate settings or, um, you know,
like, hey girlfriend, you know, like that,

504
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:21,200
things like that. Um, but
we, you know, my, my, uh,

505
00:29:21,290 --> 00:29:23,590
creative creative partner and CEO,

506
00:29:23,591 --> 00:29:26,000
he manwell shall love is in
charge of all edits. And he said,

507
00:29:26,001 --> 00:29:29,060
this is what I want to do.
Um, but I think, you know,

508
00:29:29,690 --> 00:29:32,990
I actually hadn't thought about it in
terms of pedophilia culture that like,

509
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:35,570
this is literally what I'll be thinking
about for the rest of the day and into

510
00:29:35,571 --> 00:29:37,580
the evening. No, cause I think
that's really fascinating.

511
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:41,530
I find it easier to correct other people.
And I think that's really interesting,

512
00:29:41,531 --> 00:29:44,280
right? That were too
strong. You know, women, um,

513
00:29:44,470 --> 00:29:47,680
who like red lipstick and you know,
for me,

514
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:51,310
I have a really hard
time correcting people.

515
00:29:51,311 --> 00:29:55,720
And it's funny cause I think I might've
been on the view of this morning and I

516
00:29:55,721 --> 00:29:59,800
think if someone might have sat and I,
it would never occur to me to say like,

517
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:01,780
I'm a woman.
Like I couldn't do it.

518
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:06,460
But the example I give is like my
publicist who's here. Um, you know,

519
00:30:06,461 --> 00:30:10,390
when people say like, she's such
a great girl, you know, for me,

520
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:14,680
I really am just what I talked about
in the video. I say, um, she's a woman,

521
00:30:14,890 --> 00:30:16,120
you know?
And yeah,

522
00:30:16,121 --> 00:30:19,990
doing it with a smile is just something
that as women sometimes, you know, helps,

523
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:21,520
you don't always have to do it.
But as I said,

524
00:30:21,521 --> 00:30:25,480
people will hate you less to your
face if you smile. Um, you know,

525
00:30:25,481 --> 00:30:29,650
I think that in terms of correcting
other people, that's really how I do it.

526
00:30:29,890 --> 00:30:33,890
And I think it's important
to realize that we,

527
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:38,530
although it should be,
I think remedied every single time.

528
00:30:38,650 --> 00:30:42,400
There also has to be some flexibility
in how we approach things. Like,

529
00:30:42,610 --> 00:30:45,430
I sometimes feel like it's my
job to fix the whole world,

530
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:47,830
but I also have to know that I'm,
I'm part of it.

531
00:30:47,831 --> 00:30:51,250
And I also have to function in
social situations. And sometimes,

532
00:30:51,251 --> 00:30:53,770
and I'm not saying like, oh, um, you know,

533
00:30:53,771 --> 00:30:56,860
everybody wants me to strip naked at
this party. I guess I should, you know,

534
00:30:56,980 --> 00:31:01,000
I'm talking about being flexible in terms
of there are times when I feel like,

535
00:31:01,001 --> 00:31:01,750
you know what,

536
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:05,920
if I'm this uncomfortable and I know
my convictions and I know how I want to

537
00:31:05,921 --> 00:31:08,650
behave, this may not be the
time to do it, you know?

538
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:10,090
So I think that's important too,

539
00:31:10,091 --> 00:31:14,030
to give yourself a break and know that
you're not solely responsible. Um,

540
00:31:14,110 --> 00:31:17,920
you have celebrities like me to take a
general bullet for feminists everywhere,

541
00:31:18,130 --> 00:31:21,170
um, and have everyone hate
on me because of it. Um,

542
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:23,200
but I commend you for correcting it and,
um,

543
00:31:23,230 --> 00:31:26,020
I will try and take some inspiration for
you and try and find creative ways to

544
00:31:26,021 --> 00:31:29,800
correct people. Maybe like a snap
might be good. Like I'm a woman. No,

545
00:31:30,650 --> 00:31:35,410
I didn't say thank you. Yeah.
Not feels good now. Yeah,

546
00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:37,480
it's great. We're done. Yes.

547
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:44,250
Can you talk about that other video that
you did? The science and religion one?

548
00:31:44,390 --> 00:31:47,180
I thought it was amazing. Oh, thank you.

549
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:51,290
It was very smart and just like really
beautiful and touching at the same time.

550
00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:56,180
Um, so maybe like what inspired it
and what was the reaction to it?

551
00:31:56,580 --> 00:32:00,690
Yeah, so I'm, I'm a scientist. I'm
trained as a neuroscientist and I'm,

552
00:32:00,691 --> 00:32:04,500
I'm also a person of faith and usually
the people that ask if I have conflict

553
00:32:04,501 --> 00:32:09,240
about that typically are not scientists
and they're not religious. And I,

554
00:32:09,330 --> 00:32:09,511
you know,

555
00:32:09,511 --> 00:32:13,170
I like to point out that sometimes at
no insult to atheists or agnostics,

556
00:32:13,350 --> 00:32:17,790
but sometimes those people
are more fanatical and
religious about being atheist

557
00:32:17,791 --> 00:32:22,710
or agnostic than I am about
being a religious person.
And, um, you know what I,

558
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:24,630
what I talked about in that video,
and again,

559
00:32:24,631 --> 00:32:29,330
this is something I've been ranting
about, you know, for 15 years, um,

560
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:32,910
I have never felt conflict. Um, I,

561
00:32:32,930 --> 00:32:36,680
I've never met other orthodox
or religious people, um,

562
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:38,070
who feel conflict.

563
00:32:38,370 --> 00:32:42,980
I've never met a WHO believes that the
world was literally created in six days.

564
00:32:42,981 --> 00:32:45,940
And then God rested on the set.
Like it's, you know, I, there,

565
00:32:45,950 --> 00:32:48,350
there was a quote that my rabbi
used to quote a lot, you know,

566
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:51,860
if you think that the, the Torah, you
know, the Old Testament is a science book.

567
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:56,510
I have better science books on my shelf,
you know, like, um, the, the Torah is a,

568
00:32:56,511 --> 00:33:00,740
is an historical religious,
spiritual, mystical document. Um,

569
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:03,170
it is not meant to be a science book.

570
00:33:03,470 --> 00:33:07,930
And one of my favorite realizations
that I had is that, um,

571
00:33:08,030 --> 00:33:11,780
we can call it different things,
this, this notion of faith,

572
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:16,400
but if someone has a belief that
the sun will come up tomorrow,

573
00:33:16,401 --> 00:33:19,070
which I would say we
can mostly all agree on,

574
00:33:19,370 --> 00:33:24,370
to me that's the same faith as me
believing that the universe is divine and

575
00:33:24,501 --> 00:33:29,480
things like the sun coming up happen
and the fact that when the sun comes up,

576
00:33:29,481 --> 00:33:33,740
I come from a religious and ethnic
tradition where we thank God for that

577
00:33:33,741 --> 00:33:35,720
happening.
For a lot of people,

578
00:33:35,721 --> 00:33:39,830
the way that they acknowledge that is
simply to have the alarm go off and get up

579
00:33:39,831 --> 00:33:44,540
and I don't have right to pass judgment
on how people choose to commemorate the

580
00:33:44,541 --> 00:33:47,720
divine act of the sun coming up. So it's
kind of like Neil degrasse Tyson says,

581
00:33:47,721 --> 00:33:47,871
you know,

582
00:33:47,871 --> 00:33:50,390
science is great because you don't have
to believe in it for it to be true.

583
00:33:50,630 --> 00:33:54,080
I kind of feel that way about a mystical
notion of of something divine in the

584
00:33:54,081 --> 00:33:57,170
universe. You know, I don't have to
believe that the sun's going to come up,

585
00:33:57,171 --> 00:34:00,710
it's going to come up. And for me, I
just, I don't feel conflict about that.

586
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:04,790
Everything I've ever learned
in the scientific world
has made me appreciate the

587
00:34:04,791 --> 00:34:09,380
divinity of the universe. I've never once
said, gosh, the eye is so complicated.

588
00:34:09,381 --> 00:34:12,290
It had to be created by God.
I don't even have to think like that.

589
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:16,940
The eye is so unbelievable because it
exists in the context of a universe that

590
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:21,410
that is ruled by physics and chemistry
and all of the things that humans have to

591
00:34:21,411 --> 00:34:25,370
give names to. And really the same applies
for religion and for God. You know,

592
00:34:25,371 --> 00:34:27,980
those are concepts that exist,
whether we name them or not,

593
00:34:28,130 --> 00:34:30,770
it doesn't matter what language you say
it in the fact that we called the number

594
00:34:30,771 --> 00:34:31,690
six,
the number six,

595
00:34:31,850 --> 00:34:34,700
those are all just arbitrary linguistic
classifications for things that

596
00:34:34,701 --> 00:34:37,970
literally exist. Um, so yeah,

597
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:42,170
like for me it just feels like all is
good in the navy or hood of science and

598
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:43,013
God,

599
00:34:44,930 --> 00:34:49,740
I like how you also related
that I'm wondering the world
to like internal. Yeah.

600
00:34:50,070 --> 00:34:53,910
I got all emotional recording and like
that was for real. Yeah, it's emotional.

601
00:34:53,970 --> 00:34:57,780
Yeah, no it is. Um, and we do have
time for one or two more questions.

602
00:34:57,781 --> 00:35:02,340
If anyone wants to come see me and my
ex, well, I have five more, but yes,

603
00:35:02,341 --> 00:35:04,770
go ahead. I'll ask the
question. Hi, I'm Nikki.

604
00:35:04,771 --> 00:35:09,771
My question was how do you balance being
a social conservative with being free

605
00:35:10,471 --> 00:35:11,970
liberal? Um, you know,

606
00:35:11,971 --> 00:35:16,320
I think it's funny because this
is something I'm asked a lot,

607
00:35:16,830 --> 00:35:21,810
you know, I think, I'm not trying to
be facetious, I just am, you know,

608
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:25,860
so the fact that like I don't like to
wear a sleeveless or strapless dresses or

609
00:35:25,861 --> 00:35:29,630
that, um, I prefer that no one's seen me
in a bathing suit. Like, you know, the,

610
00:35:29,631 --> 00:35:33,480
the fact that I make distinctions about
the way I present myself as a woman and

611
00:35:33,481 --> 00:35:38,160
that I find that empowering to me that
is absolutely a no with the fact that we

612
00:35:38,161 --> 00:35:42,270
should not use the death penalty.
Like I'm 100% certain in my mind, um,

613
00:35:42,450 --> 00:35:47,190
that we should not kill people. And um,
you know, for me, like I was raised,

614
00:35:47,191 --> 00:35:50,000
my parents were civil rights
activists and they were actually, um,

615
00:35:50,550 --> 00:35:54,000
they were part of the integration of
public school system here in New York.

616
00:35:54,030 --> 00:35:56,760
And my grandparents were
immigrants. Like, you know,

617
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:58,950
I was raised as a union support,

618
00:35:58,951 --> 00:36:02,120
like liberal values work for
me all the way around. Um,

619
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:05,070
as a Jewish person for most
of Jewish history in America,

620
00:36:05,071 --> 00:36:08,910
we have aligned ourselves with the
Democratic party because the principles of

621
00:36:08,911 --> 00:36:11,820
welcoming the stranger and upholding
the fallen and healing the sick, um,

622
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:16,620
is really part of what I believe
my religious tradition dictates.

623
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:21,920
But the fact that I don't like the fact
that I don't necessarily want to see

624
00:36:22,441 --> 00:36:26,030
everyone's breasts and butt cheeks in
my life every day, but in Los Angeles,

625
00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:29,310
that's kind of what it's like.
Um, you know, if I had daughters,

626
00:36:29,311 --> 00:36:33,330
I would be a very conservative
parents in terms of dress. Um,

627
00:36:33,331 --> 00:36:35,520
when my children and I go to synagogue,

628
00:36:35,521 --> 00:36:38,910
much as I believe that religion shouldn't
be a thing that children hate because

629
00:36:38,911 --> 00:36:42,810
you have to wear stuffy clothing. I do
believe in a notion of decorum that way.

630
00:36:42,811 --> 00:36:46,710
I'm old fashioned, you know, that's what
people say. Um, I liked domestic things.

631
00:36:46,711 --> 00:36:48,570
I like cooking,
cleaning and sewing.

632
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:52,260
Anytime I've ever been in
a romantic relationship, my
favorite thing is to like,

633
00:36:52,261 --> 00:36:56,250
what kind of Pie can I make? Like I
just, I, I'm just that kind of person.

634
00:36:56,251 --> 00:36:59,880
I also will make pie that I like
as well. Don't worry. Um, no,

635
00:36:59,881 --> 00:37:04,350
but I think those things get kind of put
in that social conservative sort of box.

636
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:08,250
Um, but you know, someone pointed
out I was on what show is it?

637
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:12,360
Was it James Corden? Heather, I
don't know if she's still here. Yeah,

638
00:37:12,361 --> 00:37:15,750
it was a James Corden when I flashed
piers Morgan with my Tatas. Okay. Um,

639
00:37:16,170 --> 00:37:20,310
I was on James Corden and Piers Morgan
was on and he's someone that, you know,

640
00:37:20,311 --> 00:37:22,500
I sometimes agree with but largely don't,

641
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:27,360
and Susan Surandon had just done like
that in Memoriam thing and piers Morgan

642
00:37:27,361 --> 00:37:30,450
was like super critical and felt like
tweeting about how her breasts shouldn't

643
00:37:30,451 --> 00:37:32,550
have been hanging out.
And this is a, a great,

644
00:37:32,670 --> 00:37:36,420
a great kind of intersection
of my universes where, um,

645
00:37:36,450 --> 00:37:39,180
I was really annoyed at Piers Morgan
because like there are definitely more

646
00:37:39,181 --> 00:37:42,270
important things to think about then
Susan Sarandon's breasts and would,

647
00:37:42,271 --> 00:37:45,720
I would I agree that like if you're doing
a Memoriam and I'm thinking more about

648
00:37:45,721 --> 00:37:48,240
your cleavage then the dead
people. Sure. It's awkward.

649
00:37:48,241 --> 00:37:51,690
But what I did is I turned my back to
the camera and I flashed Piers Morgan.

650
00:37:51,691 --> 00:37:55,380
I was wearing a bra, you
know, there was coverage fine.
Um, but someone pointed out,

651
00:37:55,381 --> 00:37:58,050
you know, that was like an
intersection of my rebellious feminism.

652
00:37:58,230 --> 00:38:01,650
I didn't do it to the camera, you
know, I turned my back. So anyway,

653
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:03,960
it's still not okay,
I'm sure by a lot of people's standards.

654
00:38:04,170 --> 00:38:06,510
But when I feel like, you
know, how do you combine them?

655
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:08,900
You just do and there's no
hard and fast rules. You know,

656
00:38:09,030 --> 00:38:12,500
someone pulled up a picture that was
taken, I did a photo shoot in Israel, um,

657
00:38:12,501 --> 00:38:17,220
and I'm wearing a sheer top, sorry,
I'm wearing a sheer top and yes,

658
00:38:17,221 --> 00:38:21,000
you can see cleavage because I'm wearing
whatever. I'm wearing a sheer top,

659
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:25,950
you know. And people were so quick to say
like, ha ha caught you. I'm like, really?

660
00:38:25,951 --> 00:38:27,300
Is this the world that we live in,

661
00:38:27,301 --> 00:38:31,170
that people are trolling to find pictures
where I violate certain notions of

662
00:38:31,171 --> 00:38:34,950
modesty to prove that I'm, you know, I've
never said that I do anything perfectly.

663
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:38,230
Um, but I definitely think that the
death penalty should not be allowed.

664
00:38:40,290 --> 00:38:43,420
Thank you. You do a perfect
job of not killing people.

665
00:38:44,230 --> 00:38:49,230
I perfectly don't want people
to die that way. Oh No. Yeah,

666
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:52,370
yeah. I mean some, sometimes
people die. It happens, but right.

667
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:55,660
Too soon to talk about death apparently.
Always.

668
00:38:56,740 --> 00:39:01,120
But it also sounds like one
of the differences is that
you're not imposing your

669
00:39:01,121 --> 00:39:05,500
views. You're not saying that like the
laws of the country and to that should be

670
00:39:05,501 --> 00:39:10,000
written on your, I have feelings about
the laws of the country, but yes. Well,

671
00:39:10,001 --> 00:39:14,080
so my laws of the country I think should
opt for more freedom, more acceptance,

672
00:39:14,081 --> 00:39:17,740
more rights, civil rights, human rights,
rights for women, rights for gays,

673
00:39:17,741 --> 00:39:21,370
rights for Trans People. Yeah.
I'm all for that. Um, yes.

674
00:39:21,371 --> 00:39:24,800
And rights for criminals and rights for
murderers because I'm, again, I'm like an,

675
00:39:24,910 --> 00:39:29,290
I'm an old fashioned supporter of those
kinds of rights. Um, and you know,

676
00:39:29,291 --> 00:39:34,000
if I were in, in politics or if I had a
Facebook page with a lot of followers,

677
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:38,350
I would probably take a lot of stances
and I choose to. Um, but, you know,

678
00:39:38,351 --> 00:39:42,710
I think it's very difficult. There are
certain arenas where I get to say, um,

679
00:39:43,270 --> 00:39:45,730
I'm Vegan. You don't have to be. However,

680
00:39:45,790 --> 00:39:49,430
if you want to talk about
economics and the environment, um,

681
00:39:49,630 --> 00:39:51,250
and our impact on the environment,

682
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:54,730
then maybe we should have a conversation
about Vegan. We all should, you know,

683
00:39:54,731 --> 00:39:59,020
and I think that's how I feel, you
know, I don't understand. Um, I mean,

684
00:39:59,050 --> 00:40:01,090
I don't want to talk about,
I mean we can't talk about politics.

685
00:40:01,091 --> 00:40:01,571
People want to do,

686
00:40:01,571 --> 00:40:05,250
but I literally don't understand
what's happening really anymore. Um,

687
00:40:05,290 --> 00:40:09,670
and I don't understand a
lot of places where, where,

688
00:40:09,671 --> 00:40:14,290
and how we can affect change. Why I as
a celebrity, why anyone should care.

689
00:40:14,291 --> 00:40:18,880
What I think. Um, and I understand I have
that conflict myself. Why do I do this?

690
00:40:18,881 --> 00:40:20,620
Why do I write, you know, why,

691
00:40:20,621 --> 00:40:23,710
why do I share this on a platform
with millions of people? Um,

692
00:40:23,730 --> 00:40:26,140
and I think I kind of decided like,
this is a new world.

693
00:40:26,141 --> 00:40:29,380
There really aren't rules for what
happens when a celebrity has 2 million

694
00:40:29,381 --> 00:40:32,760
followers and has the power to say,
if you believe in the right, you know,

695
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:34,870
for women to choose what
to do with their wounds,

696
00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:38,770
you may want to check out planned
parenthood or the ACL ou or the anti

697
00:40:38,771 --> 00:40:41,860
defamation league. You know, like
those are, it's a hard place to be.

698
00:40:41,861 --> 00:40:45,430
And I also don't want people to think
that I do that cavalierly. Yeah.

699
00:40:45,570 --> 00:40:47,270
You can say cavalier be right.
Yeah.

700
00:40:47,410 --> 00:40:51,490
Or in a cavalier fashion that set
skills coming out again. Oh yeah.

701
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:54,580
I believe.
I think we have one more question.

702
00:40:55,110 --> 00:40:56,690
Yeah.
Thanks so much for being here.

703
00:40:56,691 --> 00:40:59,240
I'm very excited to read
your book and I'm Darcy.

704
00:40:59,241 --> 00:41:02,750
I was curious to know more about
your writing process for this book,

705
00:41:03,110 --> 00:41:06,220
specifically anything about
the writing process, but, um,

706
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:10,490
I was curious if you talked with the
girls 10 to 18 as you were writing,

707
00:41:10,790 --> 00:41:11,510
um,

708
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:15,260
and also if there was anything that you
thought about putting in the book that

709
00:41:15,261 --> 00:41:16,094
you didn't end up

710
00:41:17,740 --> 00:41:21,940
a baby wants to know. This
is a good question. So,

711
00:41:21,941 --> 00:41:25,240
um,
you asked about the writing process,

712
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:30,100
what was the second thing if you talk to,
if I talked with it. So, yeah, I'm, I'm a,

713
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:32,920
I'm a bad student in this sense
because Jill Santa Paula was,

714
00:41:33,290 --> 00:41:36,710
here are some teen websites that you
should read to know how teens talk.

715
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:41,920
I'm glad she's not here. I
didn't look at them and um,

716
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:46,880
honestly I don't want to say I didn't
want to talk to 10 to 18 year old girls.

717
00:41:47,270 --> 00:41:51,830
Um, but in, in my arrogance and
grandiose fashion as a writer,

718
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:54,740
I really felt like I had this.
Um,

719
00:41:54,860 --> 00:41:59,150
and I know girls in this age
range and my son being 11,

720
00:41:59,151 --> 00:42:03,620
I have friends whose daughters are the
same age. And so I know plenty of girls.

721
00:42:03,621 --> 00:42:07,890
You know, we had a babysitter and
I watched her go from 15 to 18. Um,

722
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:12,140
but no, I, I'm going to be super honest.
I didn't feel that it was necessary.

723
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:15,110
And I don't just mean because
like I got a phd and you know,

724
00:42:15,111 --> 00:42:18,500
in neuroscience I get to say
whatever I want. I will say also,

725
00:42:18,501 --> 00:42:22,490
and I give credit to the
women. We had review the book,
we had a school counselor,

726
00:42:22,491 --> 00:42:26,690
a neuropsychologist, um, a pediatrician
and an ob Gyn review the book.

727
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:28,100
Um,
yeah,

728
00:42:28,101 --> 00:42:31,670
there were things about how I think that
the pill is over prescribed for girls

729
00:42:31,671 --> 00:42:35,210
and that we have a crisis of the treatment
of hormones in young women that was

730
00:42:35,211 --> 00:42:40,060
removed from the book. Just going to
go ahead and say it. Um, yeah. Um,

731
00:42:40,250 --> 00:42:43,820
I mentioned Ricki lake prominently on the
work that she has done to advocate for

732
00:42:43,821 --> 00:42:46,280
natural birth and for,
um,

733
00:42:46,430 --> 00:42:51,050
education about the overprescription
of the pill. And, um, I got some,

734
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:55,430
where's Anthony Materra? I
got some healthy pushback,
not from Anthony Materra. Um,

735
00:42:55,580 --> 00:42:58,430
I got some healthy pushback about that.
Um,

736
00:42:58,490 --> 00:43:02,600
that surprised me because I know so
many young women who are put on the pill

737
00:43:02,630 --> 00:43:05,960
before their bodies even know
what they're doing hormonally. Um,

738
00:43:06,050 --> 00:43:10,750
especially girls and
underserved populations where
they're not getting followup

739
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:13,440
care and no one cares
because, sorry. A lot of,

740
00:43:13,790 --> 00:43:17,540
we don't care about poor people
is the message that a lot of, um,

741
00:43:18,050 --> 00:43:22,480
a lot of girls get. Um, so that I
was kind of surprised about. Um,

742
00:43:22,580 --> 00:43:27,140
and in terms of the writing process,
so, you know, um, my, my dad,

743
00:43:27,141 --> 00:43:32,060
bless his memory was a writer. Um, I've
always been a creative writer and I, I,

744
00:43:32,061 --> 00:43:33,530
even though I got a
degree in neuroscience,

745
00:43:33,531 --> 00:43:37,190
I minored in Hebrew and Jewish studies
because it helped keep my GPA up because

746
00:43:37,191 --> 00:43:38,480
I could write a really good essay.

747
00:43:38,690 --> 00:43:41,090
I got an a plus in the
third riot and the Jews,

748
00:43:41,091 --> 00:43:45,350
because I wrote so many great essays
about the third riot. Um, no, but my,

749
00:43:45,370 --> 00:43:48,830
my writing skills are really more in kind
of essay form. Writing a book is very,

750
00:43:48,831 --> 00:43:52,460
very different. And for
this book, I literally,

751
00:43:52,490 --> 00:43:57,230
I took a piece of paper for
every category of our existence,

752
00:43:57,260 --> 00:44:01,100
meaning, you know, um, sex and
dating hormones and puberty.

753
00:44:01,370 --> 00:44:05,600
And then I took postits and I wrote
questions that I would've wanted answered

754
00:44:05,601 --> 00:44:07,700
for each of those categories.
And I wrote them on postits.

755
00:44:07,790 --> 00:44:10,550
So each piece of paper had,
you know, a dozen posts.

756
00:44:10,790 --> 00:44:14,360
And then the way that I started writing
is I started answering those questions.

757
00:44:14,361 --> 00:44:15,950
That's literally the way
the book was written.

758
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:18,500
I started answering those
questions and I crossed it off.

759
00:44:18,590 --> 00:44:21,170
There's something I'm never like,
I'm a list maker. I'm a postit lover.

760
00:44:21,230 --> 00:44:25,150
So this was a very gratifying experience.
Um, you know, and like pretty Charpie,

761
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:27,860
different colors for each chapter.
Um, so that's what it was like.

762
00:44:27,861 --> 00:44:30,530
And I carried those pieces
of paper around with me. Um,

763
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:34,440
I actually finished a screenplay and I
wrote in a very similar fashion that I

764
00:44:34,441 --> 00:44:35,860
did by large note cards,

765
00:44:36,220 --> 00:44:40,720
laid on a hotel bed and I locked myself
in a room and wrote a screenplay. Um,

766
00:44:40,770 --> 00:44:43,590
but yeah, this book was very
similar and I did take time away.

767
00:44:43,770 --> 00:44:46,320
I'm really a person who
loves the writing process.

768
00:44:46,321 --> 00:44:49,710
Like I love to be literally like
I lock myself in a hotel room.

769
00:44:49,830 --> 00:44:53,290
I opened the door only to get French
fries and green salad and instead like,

770
00:44:53,291 --> 00:44:55,990
you know, beers or like a
little wine at dinner. Um,

771
00:44:56,070 --> 00:44:57,630
but that's really how I wrote this book.

772
00:44:57,660 --> 00:45:00,390
And I went away and didn't talk
to anyone and it was great.

773
00:45:00,391 --> 00:45:02,310
And I just sat in a room
and that's when I was told,

774
00:45:02,311 --> 00:45:05,520
you are a writer when you love being in
a room by yourself with a bottle of red

775
00:45:05,521 --> 00:45:09,520
wine and a bowl of pasta and some French
fries and, and the thing. You're right.

776
00:45:09,860 --> 00:45:14,370
You're right. Yeah. No one else. Just me.
Yeah. All right. Well that's all the time.

777
00:45:14,371 --> 00:45:15,480
This was really fun.
Thank you.
