1
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:12,180
Hi everybody. It's a real pleasure to
be here today to talk to you about, um,

2
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:16,100
fecal microbiota transplants and some
of the work that OpenBiome and finish up

3
00:00:16,101 --> 00:00:18,640
and doing a,
I'm Kevin Roloffs.

4
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:23,720
I'm a research scientist at finch
working on microbial isolation and we are

5
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:28,200
really, and I'm really excited
to tell you about our mission,

6
00:00:28,201 --> 00:00:30,900
our shared mission to harness the
power of the human microbiome.

7
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:34,890
We'll just start off with a few basic
facts about the human microbiome.

8
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,650
So this is one of my favorite,
uh, artistic depictions
of the human micro biome.

9
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:43,710
It's just like kind of shows off like
the huge amount of bacteria that are

10
00:00:43,711 --> 00:00:48,690
covering every surface of us.
Uh, and they're on your skin,

11
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:52,440
they're on your teeth, they're all
inside of your alimentary tract.

12
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:55,860
And basically,
although they cover every surface,

13
00:00:55,861 --> 00:01:00,510
the majority of them are in
the intestine. So today, uh,

14
00:01:00,511 --> 00:01:02,520
I'm going to focus on the gut microbiome,
which,

15
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:07,260
and because that's the major
site of the human microbiome.

16
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:10,800
So what it,
what is this track look like?

17
00:01:10,801 --> 00:01:14,970
We have about seven meters of small
intestine, two meters of large intestine,

18
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:20,420
and about 32 meters squared of Mucosa
surface for the bacteria to adhere to

19
00:01:20,581 --> 00:01:23,190
along this tract,
uh,

20
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:28,670
within the large intestine and the
colon bacteria reach densities of one

21
00:01:29,431 --> 00:01:32,820
[inaudible] 11 to [inaudible]
12 cells per milliliter.

22
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:36,900
This is one of the most dense microbial
ecosystems on the, on the planet.

23
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:41,490
And it's right inside of
you. Uh, I need total,

24
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:46,520
we think that there's about a little over
about a hundred trillion bacteria per

25
00:01:46,741 --> 00:01:50,820
person that are residing on you
and making up your microbiome,

26
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,550
but the bacteria are not
just the cells there,

27
00:01:53,551 --> 00:01:55,740
the genetic content thing code as well.

28
00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:00,750
And here at Google in
particularly delighted to talk
about, uh, the microbiome,

29
00:02:00,751 --> 00:02:05,670
which was originally coined as a word
to describe the genetic content of a,

30
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:08,640
of a, of a community of organisms. Um,

31
00:02:08,641 --> 00:02:12,720
because actually we started learning about
these biomes through sequencing their

32
00:02:12,721 --> 00:02:17,250
DNA. Um, and it's really the information
content that I think is one of,

33
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:21,930
at the forefront of understanding what
the microbiome is doing. So in total,

34
00:02:21,931 --> 00:02:26,790
we've cataloged about 10 million genes
that are present in gut bacteria.

35
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,640
In any given person,
you have about 4 million.

36
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:32,850
And if you remember back from your
high school biology textbooks,

37
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:34,890
humans have around 20,000 genes.

38
00:02:34,891 --> 00:02:39,720
So the bacteria genetically
outpaced us by almost 200 fold.

39
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:43,170
As we started to learn
over the last decade,

40
00:02:43,171 --> 00:02:46,380
really the research has picked up along
with the advent of next generation

41
00:02:46,381 --> 00:02:51,300
sequencing technology. The microbiome
has incredible effects on metabolism,

42
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:52,950
immunity and cognition.

43
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:57,300
And I just kind of labeled these three
as areas where the research is pushing

44
00:02:57,301 --> 00:02:58,320
out the farthest.

45
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:03,280
But I would challenge you to talk about
areas of human physiology and wellbeing

46
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:07,180
that don't touch on metabolism,
immunity, and cognition.

47
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:12,330
But one fact I would like to change a
set straight for the record is one of you

48
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:15,760
might've heard originally that there
were 10 times more bacterial cells than

49
00:03:15,761 --> 00:03:16,630
human cells.

50
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:21,130
It's one of the favorite things that we
started talking about in the microbiome

51
00:03:21,131 --> 00:03:25,810
space, but unfortunately this is not
quite true. And some great work, uh,

52
00:03:25,811 --> 00:03:28,090
in 2016 counted,

53
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:31,300
estimated all the cells that are present
in a human and all of the cells that

54
00:03:31,301 --> 00:03:31,421
aren't,

55
00:03:31,421 --> 00:03:36,400
might be present a of bacteria and found
that the ratio is much closer to one to

56
00:03:36,401 --> 00:03:37,234
one.

57
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:41,440
And actually one of my favorite lines
from this paper was that with each

58
00:03:41,441 --> 00:03:43,780
desiccation event,
uh,

59
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,590
you may flip the ratio to favor
human cells over bacteria.

60
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:52,710
So every poop matters.
And really one of,

61
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:54,910
one of the things I really
like to think about, uh,

62
00:03:55,270 --> 00:04:00,270
to help visualize the diversity is come
take a look at this updated tree of life

63
00:04:00,431 --> 00:04:03,550
from 2016.
So this was the,

64
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:08,770
a great paper that came out that
kind of shows off the major kingdoms,

65
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:12,910
including the bacteria in
the top, uh, are in blue,

66
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:16,420
are red archaea and eukaryotes in green.

67
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:21,290
So in that tiny tip that I've
drawn a red box around,

68
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:25,570
we have our animal plants and fungi. So
that's an incredible, just think about it,

69
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,610
like that's an incredible
diversity already.

70
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:31,630
And the distances on this tree
reflect evolutionary distance.

71
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:37,090
So if you, the animals, plants
and fungi are very diverse,

72
00:04:37,091 --> 00:04:38,830
but they only occupy
that tiny little space.

73
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:42,490
Imagine how different all the rest of
this microscopic life is from each other.

74
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:45,470
It's a really hard,
hard concept to imagine because you can't,

75
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:47,140
they all look like single cells,

76
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:51,640
but they're incredibly different in
their membrane structure, their enzymes,

77
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:52,600
their physiology.

78
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:55,690
And so this is showing all bacteria
or all life that we know about.

79
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:57,580
If you check out the
right side of that tree,

80
00:04:57,610 --> 00:05:01,670
you'll see all those red dots indicating
that we've never isolated or cultured a

81
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,030
micro organism from major families there.

82
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:07,510
But I pointed out a few members
of the human gut microbiome.

83
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:12,370
So in the bottom left we have very Kolai.
So the gamma proteobacteria,

84
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:16,450
these guys are one of the first
model organisms for microbiology,

85
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:19,840
easily cultured from the
human gut. Uh, coming up,

86
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:24,820
we have the Verruca Microbia,
which contains members
such as Akkermansia, Mucin,

87
00:05:24,821 --> 00:05:27,520
Ophelia Mucin,
Ophelia for mucin lover.

88
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:31,930
This guy hangs out on the Mucosa
and it's a mucin specialist.

89
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:37,090
Above there, we have the most numerically
dominant members of the Gut microbiome,

90
00:05:37,091 --> 00:05:40,540
the bacteria dailies,
specifically the genus bacteroidetes.

91
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,550
These guys are less diverse,

92
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:46,720
but the most abundant members of your
human gut microbiome and polysaccharide

93
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:50,440
utilizers. Uh, continuing
on over to the right,

94
00:05:50,441 --> 00:05:54,750
we end up into the grand positives.
It's just the actino bacteria. Uh,

95
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:57,740
and there you have examples
such as bifidobacterium,

96
00:05:57,830 --> 00:06:01,010
which are some of the first
colonizers of the infant gut.

97
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:04,070
And further to the right,
the from Mickey D's,

98
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:09,520
a very diverse member file
family of bacteria where,

99
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:13,370
which make up the most
diversity of the human gut. Um,

100
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:15,530
although there are less
abundant than the bacteroidetes,

101
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:19,840
I should also mention the bacteria
are not the end of the, of um,

102
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:21,800
the gut gut microbiome.

103
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:26,860
You also have eukaryotes present as well
as archaea and particularly the archaea

104
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:29,900
methe antigens are very important
for nutrients cycling in the Gut.

105
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:36,400
But today we're gonna focus on
the micro biome as a whole entity.

106
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:38,420
And why I think it's the most,

107
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:42,710
one of the most applicable analogies
to it is that I'd say microbial Oregon

108
00:06:42,711 --> 00:06:45,930
system. And so you start off, um,

109
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:51,160
unborn fetuses are sterile and at
birth they're colonized either from the

110
00:06:51,471 --> 00:06:52,840
vaginal canal,
um,

111
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,600
or from the skin during
[inaudible] section.

112
00:06:57,110 --> 00:07:00,530
And so you can either,
you can see that the composite,

113
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:03,470
one of these little circles are that
are associated with each of these life

114
00:07:03,471 --> 00:07:07,340
stages or compositions showing off the
amount of from Mickey D's and pink,

115
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,800
the backdoor idds in light blue,

116
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:15,040
the actino bacteria and
blue and proteobacteria and
red and the microbial organ

117
00:07:15,591 --> 00:07:18,740
system undergoes
development as cu develop.

118
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:22,820
So as a baby,
it's a nascent Oregon.

119
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:26,540
It's mostly dominated by bifido bacteria.
With the introduction of solid food,

120
00:07:26,541 --> 00:07:28,190
the bacteroidetes start showing up

121
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:34,160
as your time in adolescence, you may
be subject to antibiotic treatment,

122
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:38,420
which will alter the composition.
Um, you may also be malnourished,

123
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:41,780
which can delay the development
of your gut, microbial Oregon.

124
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:45,530
Uh, furthermore, as well,

125
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:49,190
by the time you transition through
puberty and into adulthood,

126
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:52,610
your microbiome stabilizes
and becomes uniquely you.

127
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,500
Each of you has a distinct microbiome
that's almost as identifying or more

128
00:07:57,501 --> 00:08:00,570
identifying than a fingerprint.
Um,

129
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:04,730
and some of the major differences we can
see in the composition and adult have

130
00:08:04,731 --> 00:08:09,500
to do with obese versus healthy, some
macro differences. And then finally,

131
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:13,910
as you become elderly, the diversity
of your microbiome starts to decline.

132
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:16,880
And we're not quite sure
what the effects of that are,

133
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,340
but people are looking into it.
And it may have,

134
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:24,260
we may be able to help ameliorate
some of the effects of old age through

135
00:08:24,261 --> 00:08:29,000
restoring microbiome since a microbial
Oregon and similar to your other organs.

136
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:31,760
It structured both by your
environment and your inheritance.

137
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:33,140
So here I've just shown off,

138
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:36,590
I've talked about a few of the features
that impact the structure from the

139
00:08:36,591 --> 00:08:38,680
environment, but others, uh,

140
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:43,580
particularly at the infant are [inaudible]
versus at vaginal antibiotic exposure,

141
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:45,950
breast milk versus formula feeding.

142
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:50,240
There's particular milk
oligosaccharides in mother's milk,

143
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:54,290
which only bacteria can digest.
And some of the milk,

144
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:59,310
a formula providers are starting to try
to try to put these sugars into their

145
00:08:59,341 --> 00:09:03,970
milk formulas now, but they'd
been missing in the past. Um,

146
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:08,520
there's also additional factors such
as BMI or weight gain during pregnancy.

147
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:13,560
And the results of all of these in,
and I mentioned to you also,

148
00:09:13,561 --> 00:09:15,270
you get an initially
colonize from your mother.

149
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:20,010
The results of this inheritance
and environmental factors
produce distinct a gut

150
00:09:20,011 --> 00:09:22,470
microbiome compositions
in different populations.

151
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:27,830
So shown on the right is a principal
component analysis showing different gut

152
00:09:31,381 --> 00:09:34,800
microbiome compositions
from United States, adults,

153
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:36,990
Malawi and adults or Amerindians.

154
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:42,670
And here you can see that the
u s population is distinct
from the Malawian and

155
00:09:42,671 --> 00:09:46,320
Amerindian despite having multiple,

156
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:49,590
everyone having a unique
gut composition are,

157
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:51,840
we have a lot of functional redundancy.

158
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:56,850
So shown on the left is the composition
by Fila with the backdoor ids and blue

159
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,060
and then for making,
using green and proteobacteria in yellow.

160
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:04,770
And these are just a adults from
the human gut microbiome project.

161
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:09,930
And you can see that there's like people
who are dominated by backdoor ADTs.

162
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:12,750
There's some that have a balance of
from Mickey D's and backdoor idds.

163
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:15,660
But despite these
differences in composition,

164
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:20,840
all of them have almost the exact same
functional genes present in their gut

165
00:10:21,481 --> 00:10:23,340
microbiome.
So when I think about this,

166
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:26,790
I think about it as maybe
two different junkyards.

167
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:29,790
One of tractors and one of cars,
uh,

168
00:10:29,791 --> 00:10:33,720
but both have the functional wheels and
engines is an analogy I like to use here.

169
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:39,560
One of the things that really got me
into gut microbiome research was even

170
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:45,290
through my graduate for a hundred over
a hundred years since snow and cholera,

171
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:50,100
uh,
the bacteria have been seen as a problem,

172
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:55,650
a disease causing vectors that are just,

173
00:10:55,730 --> 00:10:59,700
uh, harmful to humans. And that's really
catalyze a lot of research into bacteria.

174
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:03,120
But it leaves people with the
impression that bacteria are bad.

175
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:07,980
And one of the great things about the
microbiome is it demonstrates that not all

176
00:11:07,981 --> 00:11:10,800
bacteria are bad.
Many of them are commensals.

177
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:13,410
They just live on us and
they don't really do much.

178
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:17,160
They don't interact with as much,
and some of them are even beneficial.

179
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:22,610
And we established these
symbiotic interactions between
beneficial bacteria and

180
00:11:22,621 --> 00:11:27,300
ourselves. So we have our cast of
characters like salad, Gutchen, Manila,

181
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,500
uh,

182
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:33,500
that's when you've eaten the potato
salad that set out too long and others.

183
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:39,180
And so what's the secret? Why can
we coexist with all these bacteria,

184
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:44,240
many of which could be harmful to us.
And I think the answer comes from, uh,

185
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,970
that from a poem by Robert Frost,

186
00:11:47,971 --> 00:11:50,520
that good friend fences
make good neighbors.

187
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:56,390
And so here you see two neighbors making
a wall together and they talk about in

188
00:11:57,461 --> 00:12:00,940
the poem talks about how building this
wall helps encourage friendly behaviors

189
00:12:00,941 --> 00:12:05,290
even though it's sending up a barrier
between them. And so similarly,

190
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:09,850
there's a wall in the gut microbiome
shown here is one of the most fascinating

191
00:12:09,851 --> 00:12:13,750
images I think have been produced of
the human gut microbiome. Actually,

192
00:12:13,751 --> 00:12:16,510
I should say this is a mouse
model of the gut microbiome,

193
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:19,240
but with a complex flora.
Uh,

194
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:24,260
the big green section is the Mucosal
mucin barrier that kind of serves us a no

195
00:12:25,481 --> 00:12:28,570
man's land between bacteria and you.

196
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:33,640
Carrots in the blue is dappy staining of
Mammalian of the eukaryotic cell cells,

197
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:40,120
their nuclei. And in the top left you
see this huge mixture of bacteria,

198
00:12:40,530 --> 00:12:43,780
um,
all different kinds mixed together.

199
00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:48,730
And you can see that the mucin is
almost completely devoid of bacteria.

200
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:52,030
And this even looking
like a laminar structure.

201
00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:56,290
And you can see that one of the
laminar pieces is sloughing off.

202
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:59,350
And starting to be
digested by the bacteria.

203
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:03,820
So the host makes the
mucin and it's stops the,

204
00:13:03,821 --> 00:13:08,560
it serves as a barrier to protect the
host from constantly interacting with

205
00:13:08,561 --> 00:13:10,450
microbial signals,
which could be harmful.

206
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:13,570
I think I'll just say a little bit more
about this mucin barrier cause it's just

207
00:13:13,571 --> 00:13:17,260
really incredible that the, uh, it's not,

208
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:21,460
it's not only a physical barrier by just
being too dense to enabled penetration.

209
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:26,560
It is a chemical barrier in
that antimicrobial proteins
and other antimicrobial

210
00:13:26,561 --> 00:13:31,390
particles are secreted from the host
into them into the mucin and serve as a

211
00:13:31,391 --> 00:13:33,520
chemical determinitive
microbial colonization.

212
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:38,590
We've now been able to show that phages
which are viruses that eat bacteria

213
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:43,470
preferentially adhere to mucus and
serve as little by little like, uh,

214
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:46,210
I don't know what you'd call them. Uh, uh,

215
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:50,140
bombs in the mucus waiting for any
bacteria to come too close to them.

216
00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:55,300
So you have chemical, you've got phage
barrier. And in addition to these,

217
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:57,580
uh,
antimicrobial properties,

218
00:13:57,910 --> 00:14:01,720
it also serves as a major source
of nutrients for the bacteria.

219
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:07,230
And so that mucin that's sloughing off
is actually being digested and promoting.

220
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:12,700
The mucin is decorated with particular
sugars that promote the metabolism of

221
00:14:12,701 --> 00:14:16,090
beneficial bacteria. So this is
just really an incredible barrier,

222
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:20,710
but I think it also helps to show you
that there's an incredible Mulu of

223
00:14:20,711 --> 00:14:23,380
bacteria that are functioning and we,

224
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:26,020
they're separated from
the host by this mucin.

225
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:31,090
One more picture from the same paper I
mentioned that the Mucin can serve as a,

226
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:32,410
as a food source.

227
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:37,210
And so shown here on the left are
mice that are fed a standard diet that

228
00:14:37,211 --> 00:14:39,760
includes polysaccharides and fiber.

229
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:45,030
And then on the right is mice that are
fed a diet that's deficient in fiber.

230
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:49,570
And you can see that the mucin
barrier in the right is dissolving.

231
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:54,870
The microbes without dietary fiber
are starting to eat away and penetrate

232
00:14:55,611 --> 00:14:59,600
further and further into the mucin. So
eats your, eat your fruits and vegetables,

233
00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:01,790
folks for your gut,
your gut microbiome.

234
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:04,880
So what aspects,

235
00:15:05,090 --> 00:15:08,330
what's particular aspects do we know
about the human gut microbiome and health?

236
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:13,680
I think in 2006, it started
really kicking off with, uh,

237
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:18,730
Peter Turnball from Jeffrey Gordon's lab
showing that you could take obese stool

238
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:23,690
from humans,
put it into a germ free mouse,

239
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:28,040
and the mouse would develop obesity.
You could take stool from a lean human,

240
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:32,090
colonize a mouse with it,
and then that mouse would remain lean,

241
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:36,230
suggesting that there was a BCA,
obesity associated gut microbiome.

242
00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:41,210
And we've went on to find more
things about the gut microbiome.

243
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:45,800
2008 Sarkis Mazmanian showed that
there was a microbial symbiosis factor,

244
00:15:45,801 --> 00:15:49,790
a polysaccharide that was produced by
one of those beneficial bacteria that was

245
00:15:49,791 --> 00:15:53,270
highly anti-inflammatory
and would prevent a audit.

246
00:15:53,330 --> 00:15:56,360
Inflammatory diseases such as
inflammatory bowel disease.

247
00:15:56,990 --> 00:16:01,550
We found that some bacteria can outcompete
pathogens such as bifidobacteria.

248
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,580
We find that,
as I said,

249
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:09,380
the gut microbiome develops and if
you're malnourished, it doesn't develop.

250
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:13,800
And in fact, when the, you've
go to malnourished children, uh,

251
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:17,900
in Malawian and you try to give them
ready to eat foods like peanut butter,

252
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:22,460
they don't get better. You need to
repair their microbiome before they can.

253
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:25,370
The food will allow them
to become not malnourished.

254
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:31,340
There's also more recently, uh, we've
known that microbiome is converting,

255
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:32,510
um,

256
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:37,510
chemicals that are derived from
red meat into their Metabo.

257
00:16:38,210 --> 00:16:43,210
The microbes are metabolizing them into
a chemical called Tmao that promotes

258
00:16:44,181 --> 00:16:49,160
heart as thorough sclerosis, otherwise
known as heart disease. And finally,

259
00:16:49,161 --> 00:16:53,360
there's some great work going on also
in the Mazmanian lab by Elaine Zau

260
00:16:53,810 --> 00:16:58,370
demonstrating that some of the Microbiota
differences you can observe in mice

261
00:16:58,430 --> 00:17:03,100
lead to neurodevelopmental disorders. And
so this is an autism spectrum, just um,

262
00:17:04,070 --> 00:17:07,580
a model in mice and fire.
And additionally,

263
00:17:07,581 --> 00:17:11,750
I think we're also finding type one
diabetes and other inflammatory autoimmune

264
00:17:11,751 --> 00:17:15,170
disorder. So you can see that this
hasn't happened to deal with metabolism,

265
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:16,760
immunity,
cognition.

266
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:21,470
One of the diseases we know about the
most in the microbiome is clostridium

267
00:17:21,471 --> 00:17:25,700
difficile. C difficile is a hospital
acquired infection that we heard about.

268
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:30,320
It can,
it can kill about 30,000 Americans a year.

269
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:33,680
It costs $5 billion in hospital
costs and it's been rising,

270
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,220
although I think actually
do open biomes work.

271
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:39,980
It's been falling lately with c difficile.

272
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:44,060
You can take antibiotics,
but it's a spore forming organism.

273
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:48,650
So even if you are able to
remove the vegetative cells,

274
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:51,960
the spores are antibiotic resistant
and they can remain in the gut and then

275
00:17:51,961 --> 00:17:52,794
germinate again.

276
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:57,090
And so antibiotics have some
efficacy but they don't cure.

277
00:17:57,150 --> 00:18:00,720
So about 30% of the time there'll be
effective in curing cedar for seal.

278
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:06,630
And the way this is working, I think I'll
just explain this little diagram here.

279
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:10,800
I think this is a really appropriate
model for fecal microbiota transplant.

280
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:15,000
You start with a healthy microbiome,
which can be perturbed by antibiotics,

281
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:18,300
which we need to take because some of
these bacteria or pathogens and they'll

282
00:18:18,301 --> 00:18:21,990
kill you. So you need antibiotics.
Let's not make any mistakes about that.

283
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:23,160
But as you're doing that,

284
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:26,790
antibiotics are like nuclear bomb
shells on the microbial world.

285
00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:30,030
They're just killing
everything and hopefully,

286
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:33,930
and most times the bacteria are able
to grow back and restore a healthy

287
00:18:33,931 --> 00:18:37,080
microbiome.
But sometimes you,

288
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:41,490
with this clear cutting of the,
of the microbial eco ecosystem,

289
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:42,241
you can get a,

290
00:18:42,241 --> 00:18:46,800
we'd like c difficile infecting and
overgrowing and preventing return to a

291
00:18:46,801 --> 00:18:51,490
normal healthy microbiome. And this can
lead to more antibiotic treatment to cut,

292
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:56,370
to get rid of the infection, which
is causing horrible diarrhea. Uh,

293
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:02,160
but then that leads right back into
another round of c difficile disease.

294
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:06,570
And so one of the most
effective treatments you
can do is take a whole fecal

295
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:10,620
microbiota transplant,
put it into a person,

296
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:12,420
and just restore the healthy ecosystem.

297
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:18,150
And that actually has about a 98
around a 90% cure rate for CDF.

298
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:21,510
It's an incredible improvement
over antibiotics. So,

299
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:24,360
but one of the problems is access,
cause that's,

300
00:19:24,361 --> 00:19:27,120
you mentioned FMT used
to be pretty sketchy.

301
00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:32,570
People would get blenders and give
each other a transplants by having the

302
00:19:33,091 --> 00:19:37,530
roommate poop into a blender, grind it up
and then like give themselves an enema.

303
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:41,340
That's not a very safe way
to do fecal transplants.

304
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:44,820
But I'm showing here a picture
of Mark Smith and James Burgess,

305
00:19:44,821 --> 00:19:46,490
the cofounders of OpenBiome.

306
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:51,570
Mark had a friend who was suffering from
c-diff and he just did not have access

307
00:19:51,571 --> 00:19:53,490
to a clinician who could
provide a fecal transplant.

308
00:19:53,910 --> 00:19:57,300
The clinicians are worried
about, uh, whether it's safe,

309
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,440
they don't know how to do it.
Um,

310
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:03,900
but mark was working on this in the lab
and he knew that FMTs could help his

311
00:20:03,901 --> 00:20:06,990
friend, but he just couldn't get
them from anywhere. So with James,

312
00:20:06,991 --> 00:20:11,991
they decided to make open biome to provide
access to FMT using a universal donor

313
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:14,820
model. So the universal
donor model, what is that?

314
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:20,750
That's the model where instead of trying
to find one specific person who's maybe

315
00:20:20,761 --> 00:20:24,890
you live with so that you'd have a similar
gut microbiome and trying to screw,

316
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:28,920
make sure that they don't have any
infectious diseases that you could get and

317
00:20:28,921 --> 00:20:32,490
screening that one person individually
and then trying to get a fecal transplant

318
00:20:32,491 --> 00:20:36,060
done. Instead, what you do
is use open up a stool bank,

319
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:41,400
a you taking use heavily screened donors
and you enable everyone to provide,

320
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:47,080
uh, enable very healthy donors to
provide stool that can then be given to

321
00:20:47,081 --> 00:20:47,920
clinicians,

322
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:51,700
should just be used as a treatment instead
of relying on the clinician's knowing

323
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:54,520
about how to do the screening
and how to do the preparation.

324
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:58,810
And so OpenBiome has been incredibly
successful at scaling the universal donor

325
00:20:58,811 --> 00:20:59,644
model.

326
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:04,340
It provided over 25,000 treatments in
950 hospitals and clinics and opened by

327
00:21:04,341 --> 00:21:08,320
owns network in all 50 states
and in seven countries,

328
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:13,270
including the u s and as part of this,
the universal stool donor program.

329
00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:17,950
That's kind of why I'm here today to help
tell you about this and encourage you

330
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:20,710
to become a part of this program.

331
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:23,920
There's an incredible dropoff because
when there's a lot of screening that's

332
00:21:23,921 --> 00:21:28,750
done, there's a prescreen survey in
which about 66% of people pass just,

333
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,630
um, looking at lifestyle
associated conditions.

334
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:35,980
There's a clinical assessment in
which 84% are make it through.

335
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:37,810
And then finally laboratory testing,

336
00:21:37,811 --> 00:21:41,980
which results in another only 47% getting
through to results in a total of only

337
00:21:41,981 --> 00:21:44,920
2.8% of our donors who apply,

338
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:49,300
being able to be a stool donor.
So this is a very tight pipeline,

339
00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:51,790
but it can be very effective.

340
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:56,530
So I encourage you to give
poop at gift pooped out Org.

341
00:21:57,130 --> 00:21:59,110
You can save lives,
earn money,

342
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:02,470
and donate your stool and make
your morning routine heroic.

343
00:22:04,450 --> 00:22:08,890
I think one of the most exciting things
that we're doing at finch and OpenBiome

344
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:13,180
is looking about looking ahead to
find out what new diseases might fecal

345
00:22:13,181 --> 00:22:14,650
transplants be effective for.

346
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:19,060
And so I'll just share with you
a small vignette about alopecia.

347
00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:24,430
Alopecia is an autoimmune disease in
which you start to lose your hair,

348
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:27,370
uh,
and or all hair on your body.

349
00:22:27,670 --> 00:22:30,190
And so shown here as a patient
at 16 years old on the,

350
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:33,580
on the far left starting to lose hair.
Um,

351
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:39,420
then this patient unfortunately also
contracted c difficile and then received a

352
00:22:40,001 --> 00:22:41,590
fecal transplant and as a result,

353
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:46,270
and so this middle picture shows him right
before receiving the fecal transplant.

354
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:51,430
And then after the fecal transplant,
his he notices hair started to regrow.

355
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:53,103
And these have now been,

356
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:56,880
this one anecdote has now become two
anecdotes and we're very interested in

357
00:22:56,920 --> 00:23:00,370
following up on it. Ask
for one example, but uh,

358
00:23:00,490 --> 00:23:05,050
this kind of shows you how connected the
gut microbiome is to our overall health

359
00:23:05,051 --> 00:23:08,980
and ways that we can't know today.
But we're hoping to discover tomorrow.

360
00:23:10,150 --> 00:23:15,100
And so without a leave you by saying
that we're OpenBiome and finch or focused

361
00:23:15,101 --> 00:23:19,600
on safe access, clinical research,
perpetual access and new cures.

362
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:21,483
Thank you.

363
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:26,003
Okay.

364
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:29,680
Now have some time for
questions and answers and nod.

365
00:23:29,890 --> 00:23:32,890
Like I'll also introduce and meg,
Meg Megan food.

366
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:38,050
Did I mispronounce your last
name horribly? Yeah. Meg Is, uh,

367
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:42,310
one of our ex on our external
affairs team at OpenBiome. Yeah,

368
00:23:42,810 --> 00:23:46,360
we screen for a lot of
different conditions. Um,

369
00:23:46,370 --> 00:23:49,880
and you do have to have a BMI under 30.
If you want to become a stool donor.

370
00:23:51,910 --> 00:23:53,710
The front,
why is the,

371
00:23:55,150 --> 00:23:59,930
why is the pipeline so narrow that you
really have to be that careful? Is that

372
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:02,590
what makes it so narrow?

373
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:04,300
Why is the pipeline so narrow?

374
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:09,600
What partly because there's research
indicating that the gut microbiome is

375
00:24:10,121 --> 00:24:13,070
related to pretty much everything.
Um,

376
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:16,690
partly because a lot of people tend to
carry conditions they don't know about.

377
00:24:16,710 --> 00:24:20,590
Um, when we test for still note are the
people that we reject that don't make it

378
00:24:20,591 --> 00:24:22,810
through rather, um, aren't
necessarily unhealthy.

379
00:24:22,811 --> 00:24:25,750
But there are people who are carrying a
transmission of disease or some sort of

380
00:24:25,751 --> 00:24:28,600
condition that we think might harm
the people with C diff. I mean,

381
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:32,110
two things to remember here. One, we're
regulated by the FDA, which has very,

382
00:24:32,111 --> 00:24:35,770
very strict standards and to the
people who are getting fecal microbiota

383
00:24:35,771 --> 00:24:38,650
transplants are really,
really sick. You know,

384
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:43,060
fecal Microbiota transplants are
only approved for recurrent CDI.

385
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:45,680
C diff infections,
not the initial C diff infection.

386
00:24:45,681 --> 00:24:47,230
So by the time they get to us,

387
00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:49,840
they've already been through at
least two rounds of antibiotics,

388
00:24:49,841 --> 00:24:54,010
typically had this disabling
diarrhea for three, four, five,

389
00:24:54,011 --> 00:24:56,680
six months or even longer in some cases.

390
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:59,380
So we can't take any chances that,
oh,

391
00:24:59,381 --> 00:25:02,470
that little noro virus that you happen
to carry that doesn't cause you any

392
00:25:02,471 --> 00:25:03,190
problems.

393
00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:06,160
Could could kill this person who's already
in a very delicate state of health.

394
00:25:06,430 --> 00:25:07,680
So,
um,

395
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:10,420
that's why it's narrow and we can't
predict who's going to make it through the

396
00:25:10,421 --> 00:25:11,470
pipeline or not.
You know,

397
00:25:11,471 --> 00:25:14,920
some people are Gung Ho rowers
and need a perfect fiber diet.

398
00:25:14,921 --> 00:25:17,380
Some people just kind of munch
French fries and walk around,

399
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:22,060
but they for some reason have this
really great gut microbiome and aren't

400
00:25:22,061 --> 00:25:25,120
carrying any, anything we don't
want in there is we can't predict.

401
00:25:25,121 --> 00:25:29,320
That's why we have to ask all
of you to apply. And there,

402
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:38,320
do we have to match donor recipient?
No, that's the wonderful thing. Um,

403
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:42,620
as long as the person isn't carrying
some sort of disease or has some sort of

404
00:25:42,621 --> 00:25:45,680
condition we think might make you
sick or pretty much anyone will do,

405
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:47,140
it's really amazing.
It'll,

406
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:49,640
it'll all work in C diff and
it works about 90% of the time.

407
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:54,860
That is not necessarily true for
other conditions. Um, open biome,

408
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:59,870
we have a dual mission of providing safe
access to fecal microbiota transplants

409
00:25:59,871 --> 00:26:02,270
for c diff but also
promoting clinical research.

410
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:06,380
And we're currently involved in the
30 different clinical research trials

411
00:26:06,381 --> 00:26:11,060
looking to things like inflammatory
bowel disease, Crohn's disease,

412
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:13,280
even peanut allergies and one case.

413
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:17,420
And there's some indication from some of
our work on types of inflammatory bowel

414
00:26:17,421 --> 00:26:21,470
disease that there are differences
between donors and their effectiveness in

415
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:24,830
promoting remissions. So for seed, if it
doesn't matter for other things it might,

416
00:26:24,831 --> 00:26:26,960
we're not sure yet, which is why
we're doing all this research.

417
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,400
Hi,
a wonderful talk.

418
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:32,040
I was wondering if you could tell us
anything about what either known or

419
00:26:32,041 --> 00:26:32,741
theorize,

420
00:26:32,741 --> 00:26:37,741
but the mechanisms between
the gut microbiome and any
of these other conditions

421
00:26:38,581 --> 00:26:40,060
such as obesity or the,

422
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:44,430
the hair loss or either known or
theorized about that, those connections.

423
00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:49,450
So sometimes we're digging into specific
mechanisms and sometimes it's not

424
00:26:49,451 --> 00:26:53,500
known. So particularly in
the obesity case, it was,

425
00:26:53,710 --> 00:26:58,710
there was a investigation
into the metallic metabolic
genes and we were able to

426
00:27:00,071 --> 00:27:04,690
see that there is an over abundance of
metabolic genes associated with energy

427
00:27:04,691 --> 00:27:08,970
harvest suggesting that potentially the,
um,

428
00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:13,510
microbes are just liberating or make it
so you'd have this fiber that's good,

429
00:27:13,570 --> 00:27:15,240
but normally it's just exclude screened.

430
00:27:15,241 --> 00:27:17,380
And they used us with
food for the bacteria,

431
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:22,360
but they may be producing metabolites
which can then be absorbed by the human

432
00:27:22,361 --> 00:27:27,190
host, um, and that may be providing
more energy from a given set of food.

433
00:27:27,670 --> 00:27:28,503
Um,

434
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:33,070
and actually those metabolites are
also potentially underlying some of the

435
00:27:33,071 --> 00:27:34,870
inflamed inflammation parts.

436
00:27:34,990 --> 00:27:38,260
So I mentioned there was a specific
polysaccharide that was released by

437
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:40,990
bacteroidetes,
which was in anti-inflammatory,

438
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:46,240
but that's a pretty specific one.
One of the most general mechanisms,

439
00:27:46,570 --> 00:27:51,160
uh, that's well known is the production
of these short chain fatty acids like

440
00:27:51,161 --> 00:27:52,860
butyrate at appropriate Nate,

441
00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:56,470
which are just small little carbons
that result from the breakdown of

442
00:27:56,471 --> 00:27:57,370
polysaccharides.

443
00:27:57,580 --> 00:28:01,690
And many bacteria in the gut can release
those and they serve as actually the

444
00:28:01,810 --> 00:28:05,320
primary food source for your
colonic endothelial cells.

445
00:28:05,770 --> 00:28:07,960
And so not only do they help the cells,

446
00:28:07,961 --> 00:28:10,450
how by providing their
preferred metabolite,

447
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:13,780
they can also trigger
a specific receptors,

448
00:28:13,990 --> 00:28:18,990
g of protein receptors in immune
cells to have diverse effects.

449
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:22,840
But the results of which are generally
the production of anti inflammatory

450
00:28:22,841 --> 00:28:26,800
cytokines and the reprogramming of immune
cells away from inflammation towards

451
00:28:26,801 --> 00:28:27,634
tolerance.

452
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:31,890
And people are looking at this,

453
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:35,040
these immune effects of the gut
microbiome in an astonishing number of

454
00:28:35,041 --> 00:28:35,551
conditions.

455
00:28:35,551 --> 00:28:39,240
There's some really interesting research
coming out about the gut microbiome and

456
00:28:39,241 --> 00:28:41,790
multiple sclerosis and
Parkinson's disease.

457
00:28:41,791 --> 00:28:44,580
And there a couple of really interesting
papers that came out just last week

458
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:45,900
about um,

459
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:49,920
mediation mediating in cancer treatments
and evolved immune system that some

460
00:28:49,921 --> 00:28:54,390
people who have certain type of Gut
Microbiota chemotherapy as much more

461
00:28:54,391 --> 00:28:58,590
effective. And if you take their gut
microbiome and put them in germ free mice,

462
00:28:59,010 --> 00:29:02,730
you find the same differences in the
mice as you did between people when they

463
00:29:02,731 --> 00:29:06,240
undergo cancer treatments. So anything
having to do the immune disease, it just,

464
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:08,760
anything that's pretty astonishing.
Yeah.

465
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:10,840
So there was a paper in nature,

466
00:29:10,841 --> 00:29:15,841
I believe 2014 about the effect of um,

467
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:21,620
the sugar substitutes on the
gut microbes and resulting hmm.

468
00:29:23,790 --> 00:29:28,240
Um, resulting a metabolic
syndrome symptoms essentially,

469
00:29:28,241 --> 00:29:32,050
which could be transferred from
mouse to a mouse by, by, uh,

470
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:34,420
by fecal transplant.

471
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:38,590
Seems like the sort of thing that we both
known to you and flashy and shocking.

472
00:29:38,591 --> 00:29:42,250
We've been followed up by
other researchers by now.
What's latest in that area?

473
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:44,890
So actually no,
that paper pretty well.

474
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:48,000
It was fascinating because
it's like one of the,

475
00:29:48,001 --> 00:29:51,880
these are artificial sweeteners that are
supposed to be not metabolized, right?

476
00:29:51,881 --> 00:29:55,570
So they're supposed to be calorie
free, uh, but still have sweetness.

477
00:29:55,810 --> 00:30:00,810
But one of the things that means by not
metabolized normally sugars are like

478
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:05,550
digested and the simple ones are
dissolved almost out of your mouth. Like,

479
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:10,060
and if not by then in at least in
the, um, in the small intestine. Uh,

480
00:30:10,270 --> 00:30:11,980
but these ones make,
are not,

481
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:16,060
and they make their way straight down
into the gut microbiome, the colon.

482
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:22,260
And there they were shown to have an
effect on promoting a signaling that would

483
00:30:23,381 --> 00:30:27,790
lead to like metabolic disorder in
mice. There's, I haven't seen that.

484
00:30:27,791 --> 00:30:30,880
There's been new updates on that story.
Um,

485
00:30:30,910 --> 00:30:33,250
I think one of the caveats
there is that they were,

486
00:30:33,550 --> 00:30:36,850
I tried to calculate how much artificial
sweetener they were feeding the mice.

487
00:30:37,270 --> 00:30:40,120
And I think it was somewhere
around like if you were a human,

488
00:30:40,121 --> 00:30:44,080
you need to have like
70 packages of, uh, ah,

489
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:47,740
which one was it? I won't, I won't say
which one so I don't get in trouble.

490
00:30:47,741 --> 00:30:50,590
But like one, whichever one it was,
didn't need to open 70 packets.

491
00:30:50,591 --> 00:30:53,400
I need that much to get the same dosing
that was being applied to the month

492
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:55,120
mouse.
Um,

493
00:30:55,990 --> 00:30:59,140
also the other interesting part is
they didn't just feed it to the mice.

494
00:30:59,170 --> 00:31:03,340
They took the bacteria out
and they dosed the bacteria,

495
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:08,860
grew it with this artificial sweetener
as the sole nutrient source for awhile

496
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:10,870
and then they transplanted it back.

497
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:14,200
And then the community had these
different signaling effect soon as a few

498
00:31:14,201 --> 00:31:14,951
caveats there,

499
00:31:14,951 --> 00:31:19,540
but it definitely hinted that these
artificial sweeteners may not,

500
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:24,610
while they may be calorically in are
they may have a strong signaling effect

501
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:25,930
mediated by the microbiome.

502
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:29,850
Fun fact about mouse
experiments in the microbiome.

503
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:33,160
Mice do their own fecal transplants
if they want us together,

504
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:37,180
much like dogs do sometimes.
There was another question in front

505
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:43,710
research and irritable bowel syndrome.
We certainly are.

506
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:47,250
If you're interested in any clinical
trials of fecal microbiota transplants,

507
00:31:47,251 --> 00:31:51,390
clinical trials.gov, uh, you
can put in on the search term,

508
00:31:51,391 --> 00:31:56,391
your condition and then FMT or fecal
microbiota transplant or just fecal and

509
00:31:56,491 --> 00:31:57,600
you'll come up with list of trials.

510
00:31:57,601 --> 00:31:59,070
I know there are a couple
of running in Boston,

511
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:02,040
probably Doctor Jessica Allegretti
ready at Brigham and women's,

512
00:32:02,041 --> 00:32:05,400
but don't quote me on that. Um,
look it up on clinical trials.gov.

513
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:08,940
Any other questions?

514
00:32:09,050 --> 00:32:12,840
Could you speak more as to what you're
looking for in the pipeline that you

515
00:32:12,841 --> 00:32:13,674
mentioned earlier?

516
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:19,110
Uh, so in each of these
stages, I think they're,

517
00:32:19,950 --> 00:32:22,560
I mean, maybe you might be the
right person for through this. Yeah,

518
00:32:23,630 --> 00:32:24,710
like on a regular basis.

519
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:28,500
The donor survey has a variety of
questions about lifestyle risk.

520
00:32:28,501 --> 00:32:32,050
So maybe are you monogamous?
Um,

521
00:32:33,230 --> 00:32:34,070
no, no, no, no.

522
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,073
Oh,
okay.

523
00:32:38,430 --> 00:32:39,490
Honestly,
um,

524
00:32:40,050 --> 00:32:41,260
they've updated it.
Yeah.

525
00:32:41,630 --> 00:32:44,960
We really want to know that you live in
Boston or Cambridge or somewhere around

526
00:32:44,961 --> 00:32:47,870
here. First of all, because we get a lot
of people applying and say, this is cool.

527
00:32:47,871 --> 00:32:51,020
I live in Paraguay. I'm like, no, you
cannot send us your poop in the mail.

528
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:54,140
Don't even think about it. So
that's, that's her primary criterion.

529
00:32:54,141 --> 00:32:58,340
Can you actually get to one of our donor
sites and we have donor sites at inner

530
00:32:58,341 --> 00:33:01,340
belt road in Somerville and your Sullivan
Square Station and one in central

531
00:33:01,341 --> 00:33:01,761
square.

532
00:33:01,761 --> 00:33:06,650
Very convenient to Google headquarters
and another one at Bu West if you're on

533
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:09,810
that side of the river. Um, and
they're open every day of the week. Um,

534
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:14,720
and they're very convenient and they're
staffed by friendly people. Um, you know,

535
00:33:14,721 --> 00:33:16,340
we're looking to see are healthy.
Um,

536
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:19,790
if you have a history of colitis
or inflammatory bowel disease,

537
00:33:20,090 --> 00:33:24,740
this isn't what you should be
doing. Um, but overall it's,

538
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:28,820
it's about health. And again, there
are things that you may be carrying.

539
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:31,400
A lot of people carry parasites
without knowing it, you know,

540
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:32,900
hominids or something like that.

541
00:33:32,901 --> 00:33:36,710
And you can't tell that until you got
to the end of the clinical interview and

542
00:33:36,711 --> 00:33:39,830
gone through blood and stool screening
because he wa you wouldn't ask your

543
00:33:39,831 --> 00:33:43,370
doctor, you know, he wouldn't say, Hey,
can you just test me for parasites?

544
00:33:43,371 --> 00:33:45,050
You have no reason to suspect,
but again,

545
00:33:45,051 --> 00:33:48,350
you could be carrying something that
could make someone very sick. Um,

546
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:53,060
we test for more than 30 different
conditions and we have a rather lengthy

547
00:33:53,061 --> 00:33:55,910
questionnaire that people go through
before they even go to the nurse.

548
00:33:55,911 --> 00:33:59,600
So it's hard for me to summer
as as it right now. And, um,

549
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:01,280
but if you're curious,

550
00:34:01,310 --> 00:34:05,030
go to give poop.org register and we
will probably point you to a copy of the

551
00:34:05,031 --> 00:34:09,740
questionnaire and you can see for yourself
other questions,

552
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:14,170
uh, that just prompted one. When
you say you do all the testing,

553
00:34:14,171 --> 00:34:18,670
do you give the results to the donor
or is that just used internally?

554
00:34:19,230 --> 00:34:24,230
If we abide by HIPPA regulations and if
we find anything new about your health

555
00:34:25,621 --> 00:34:26,910
that you do not tell us about.

556
00:34:26,911 --> 00:34:30,450
Like if we get the stool and blood
sample back and say, Hey, wait a minute,

557
00:34:30,451 --> 00:34:34,730
this person is positive for HIV for
example, we certainly tell you. But, um,

558
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:38,280
if it just comes back that it's
something he said, oh by the way,

559
00:34:38,281 --> 00:34:40,980
I got hepatitis last year and you
come back positive for hepatitis,

560
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:46,140
we would call you. Um, but generally we
don't find anything new. Most people,

561
00:34:46,510 --> 00:34:49,320
um, are excluded from donation,
not because of anything new,

562
00:34:49,321 --> 00:34:51,660
but because of something that could
affect the people who are getting the

563
00:34:51,661 --> 00:34:54,990
transplants,
like having a family history of colitis.

564
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:59,050
Yeah, I came in late and missed the
talk. So I'm going to ask a question,

565
00:34:59,051 --> 00:35:01,110
which might have been the last,

566
00:35:02,050 --> 00:35:06,160
what assays do you perform on the samples?
Genetic essays,

567
00:35:06,161 --> 00:35:07,810
sequencing such,

568
00:35:08,350 --> 00:35:12,040
yeah, that's a great
question. So as I mentioned,

569
00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:16,300
the reason we start to know so much about
the gut microbiome is because of next

570
00:35:16,301 --> 00:35:21,010
generation sequencing technology. And so
particularly the two types of sequences,

571
00:35:21,070 --> 00:35:24,820
we generally perform our
16 s amplicon sequencing.

572
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:30,060
So here every bacteria
has a specific gene.

573
00:35:30,270 --> 00:35:35,110
It was called the 16 s ribosomal RNA gene.
And here,

574
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:36,460
because each one of them has it,

575
00:35:36,461 --> 00:35:39,660
you can use it as a marker for
how they're related to each other.

576
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:43,170
And that can give you an overall
picture of the community,

577
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:47,010
but it doesn't get a high enough
resolution because everyone has it.

578
00:35:47,011 --> 00:35:51,120
It doesn't change fast enough to really
let you get down into the species much

579
00:35:51,121 --> 00:35:52,110
less the strains.

580
00:35:52,230 --> 00:35:57,230
So bacteria with identical 16 s gene
sequences could have up to like 20 to 30%

581
00:35:58,051 --> 00:35:59,100
of their genome will be different.

582
00:35:59,730 --> 00:36:03,210
So the other type of sequencing we do
is called shotgun and Meta genomics.

583
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:08,540
And here instead of starting with a PCR
preliminary chain reaction to target a

584
00:36:10,261 --> 00:36:11,130
specific gene,

585
00:36:11,370 --> 00:36:15,450
you just look at every single piece
of DNA that you can find and start

586
00:36:15,451 --> 00:36:20,300
sequencing it. And that gives you
a piece here, a piece there, uh,

587
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:21,030
and they're hard.

588
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:24,690
It's much more computationally difficult
to understand the results of shotgun

589
00:36:24,691 --> 00:36:25,524
sequencing,

590
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:29,160
but it's can get you down into the
strain level composition of the gut

591
00:36:29,161 --> 00:36:29,994
microbiome.

592
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:35,260
I'll follow up and ask exactly what do
you do a assembly technology do you use

593
00:36:36,301 --> 00:36:39,500
to try and ask say
these shotgun sequences?

594
00:36:40,110 --> 00:36:45,110
I used store the bloat institute across
the street as a building genome assembly

595
00:36:46,081 --> 00:36:47,700
tool.
So that's my interest.

596
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:53,230
Yeah. Unfortunately, I don't think I can
say much about that for two reasons. One,

597
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:56,880
I'm mostly on the microbial
isolation side. Uh,

598
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:00,100
I'm really hoping to improve
my computational skills,

599
00:37:00,101 --> 00:37:03,640
but I just couldn't speak confidently
about the different pipelines that are

600
00:37:03,641 --> 00:37:07,020
being used right now, uh, by
our data science team. Um,

601
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:10,960
I'd happy to be put in touch with sunny
at Timberlake who is our director of

602
00:37:10,961 --> 00:37:14,560
data science. It could maybe say some
more about that. Thank you very much.

603
00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:15,040
Thank you.
