1
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:07,250
Okay.
So without further ado,

2
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:11,180
can you please give a warm welcome to
today's speaker, Christina and rush.

3
00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:15,090
[inaudible].

4
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:19,690
Thank you very much. Can
everybody hear me okay? Yeah.

5
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:24,630
So it's such a pleasure to be here.
Thank you very much. They will welcome.

6
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:27,740
I'm a child and family psychotherapist,

7
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:32,850
so I work with families from various
backgrounds with various difficulties.

8
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:35,460
Um,

9
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:40,460
but the other things that I do is I like
to talk to people about what the code

10
00:00:42,241 --> 00:00:46,590
research says about brain development
in children for babies and children.

11
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:50,490
Um, because I think this is information
that should be available to every petite,

12
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:55,050
not just psychologists, therapists,
medical professional, social workers.

13
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:57,330
It's information that we all know.

14
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:02,360
It can make an enormous difference to how
we live our lives in our relationships

15
00:01:03,221 --> 00:01:07,140
with not just with our children, but
also with each other, with our partners,

16
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:10,230
with our friends,
with our extended family.

17
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:15,060
So what I'm going to talk to you about
today extends across many different

18
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:18,810
aspects of our lives. Um, and, uh,

19
00:01:18,811 --> 00:01:22,290
I hope you go away feeling informed,

20
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:24,930
but also inspired,
uh,

21
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:30,030
in what you bring to other people,
to your relationships in your life.

22
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:34,800
Because I'm going to be talking about
the importance of those relationships far

23
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:37,440
our physical and our mental health.

24
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:42,720
So we know now from all the
research in neuroscience that,

25
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:44,030
um,
uh,

26
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:49,040
charge brain development is very much
dependent on the quality of the social

27
00:01:50,761 --> 00:01:55,350
relationships that that child has
in their lives. And the child's,

28
00:01:55,510 --> 00:02:00,510
the foundations of the brain are very
much built on those relationships,

29
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:05,350
what they bring to the child
and how they manifest, um,

30
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:08,850
as, as impact on the brain.
So I'll be talking about that.

31
00:02:08,851 --> 00:02:12,660
So the aim of the presentation is really
to talk to you about the neuroscience

32
00:02:12,661 --> 00:02:17,661
and how emotional visibility and the
input in terms of the relation relational

33
00:02:18,181 --> 00:02:23,181
quality of the apples around the
child have a powerful impact on the

34
00:02:23,611 --> 00:02:25,920
neurochemistry,
the neurobiology.

35
00:02:25,921 --> 00:02:29,980
So the structural aspects of brain
development, the neurochemical,

36
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:35,190
so how the hormones and chemicals respond
in our brains and in our bodies and

37
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:41,420
overall how that influences the structural
development of the brain bundles.

38
00:02:42,061 --> 00:02:45,480
So the social,
emotional and cognitive development.

39
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,400
Just before I get going, or
if you just wanted to, uh,

40
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:52,980
I'm curious about what brought
many of you here today.

41
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:55,170
So would anybody be willing to say,

42
00:02:55,650 --> 00:03:00,650
if you had a question in your mind that
you with you that you'd like to explore?

43
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:05,303
Yeah.

44
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:09,580
Hi. Um, we, I have two
young toddlers at home.

45
00:03:09,581 --> 00:03:14,581
They're two and three and they're in
crashed part time when we're thinking my

46
00:03:14,671 --> 00:03:16,110
putting them into crash full time.

47
00:03:16,111 --> 00:03:21,111
And I don't know if being in a crash
in these formative years we'll have any

48
00:03:21,751 --> 00:03:25,830
negative impact. And it's something that
that does kind of concern is Maria. So,

49
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:29,550
wow. So for me, it's Ryan, I suppose
if we're not available as parents,

50
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:34,330
does it, does that have any kind of
impact? That's a good question. Thank you.

51
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:36,860
Anybody else?

52
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:41,540
Yeah, the three young kids and, um,

53
00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:46,460
just obviously interested
in the neuroscience son,
their direct development,

54
00:03:46,461 --> 00:03:49,580
but also just curious as to,
um,

55
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:54,730
how the relationship between the parents
can impact the children and any of the

56
00:03:54,951 --> 00:03:57,890
science around that.
That could be useful.

57
00:03:58,130 --> 00:04:01,620
Okay, great. So I'm
just going to just, uh,

58
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:05,120
to hold those questions.
That's the penny or somewhere.

59
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:12,280
So we have less than an hour left.
Um,

60
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:17,070
so I'm just going to,
uh,

61
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:23,700
capture that as parents together and
then, uh, young children and crashes.

62
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:30,753
MMM.

63
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:33,350
Just so because of the
limited time we have,

64
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:36,260
we won't be able to go into
any of this in great detail,

65
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:39,940
but hopefully I'll be able
to touch on it for you. Um,

66
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:44,780
in talking about the, uh, what it
is that shapes brain development.

67
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:46,190
Okay.

68
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:50,960
So the jury is in that we know that
we need each other people need people.

69
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:55,160
That's how we develop in a healthy way,

70
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:58,250
both physically and emotionally.
And I do add in physical,

71
00:04:58,251 --> 00:05:02,910
because there's quite a few
studies now across the world, um,

72
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:07,100
that demonstrate the importance of
emotional health for physical health.

73
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:12,670
So relationships build brains, minds.
We know that, we know that, um,

74
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:16,760
from the neural science and the buyer,
the research into biochemistry,

75
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:21,770
but actually relationships come
to regulate our nervous systems.

76
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:27,010
So they come to bring us into
emotional balance if they work well.

77
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:32,980
And that's because our hormonal
systems sync with each other.

78
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:37,560
And, but this is particular important
for infants, for babies. Uh, and I'll be,

79
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:41,420
uh, uh, elaborating on
this as we go along.

80
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:45,700
But for babies and for all of us,
you know,

81
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:49,500
the idea of being in sync with each
other, no, if you heard of that, um,

82
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:54,710
it is in terms of being emotionally and
think it means how neuro biologically by

83
00:05:56,151 --> 00:05:57,920
chemically we're in with each other.

84
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,510
That's how our systems are
connecting on that level.

85
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:06,470
And biochemistry is like electricity.
We can't see it, but we know it exists.

86
00:06:06,471 --> 00:06:10,010
Right? Does everybody convinced
electricity exists by now?

87
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,620
Um,
so it's interesting.

88
00:06:12,621 --> 00:06:16,820
There are all these chemical processes
going on that affect us with each other,

89
00:06:16,821 --> 00:06:19,250
but we don't,
we don't know what's happening,

90
00:06:19,251 --> 00:06:24,170
but certainly the research has
been able to substantiate that. Um,

91
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,700
and the more so a little,
uh,

92
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:32,790
proposition that I'm throwing at you
today is the more individualistic we

93
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:36,410
become, the more anxious than
depressed we've become as humans.

94
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:41,120
And there's plenty of evidence to
demonstrate that social isolation. It has,

95
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:44,770
uh, holds the biggest threat
to our mental health. And, um,

96
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:49,900
you may well know that the greatest
form of torture is what solitary

97
00:06:51,231 --> 00:06:52,010
confinement.

98
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:56,800
And it's used for a reason because it
really has such a detrimental impact on us

99
00:06:56,801 --> 00:07:01,010
as human beings. Um, relationships
heal troubled brains.

100
00:07:01,011 --> 00:07:06,011
We also know that from the research into
how therapy works and actually across

101
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:10,580
thousands of a therapeutic approaches,
there wasn't very many,

102
00:07:10,581 --> 00:07:13,460
many models of therapy.
What we know,

103
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:17,930
the common denominator in terms of what
makes a difference is the quality of the

104
00:07:17,931 --> 00:07:20,930
relationship between the
practitioner and the client.

105
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:25,850
And actually I would say that goes
for any professional. If you go to GP,

106
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,120
if your GPA is not
particularly relational,

107
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,090
if will be a very different
experience and outcome for you.

108
00:07:32,091 --> 00:07:33,230
Would you agree with that?

109
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:38,180
And there is a lot of research into
the relationship with the medical

110
00:07:38,181 --> 00:07:41,150
practitioner and how
that can impact and how,

111
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:44,690
whether we get better and
how quickly we get better.

112
00:07:44,691 --> 00:07:47,460
So that's all that's really interesting.
Um,

113
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:51,980
and we're all in as resilient as humans,
as the people we're connected to.

114
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:55,340
So we're all both
vulnerable and resilient.

115
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:58,970
So it's not the one person is
resilient another innocent.

116
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,790
But it depends on many factors.

117
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:06,791
So resilience is actually
a social phenomenon rather
than just about the grips

118
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:09,290
that you have as a human being.

119
00:08:09,291 --> 00:08:13,130
I've got that comes into it and how
you develop your capacity to be able to

120
00:08:13,131 --> 00:08:15,380
bounce back from stress and challenge.

121
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:20,690
But without other people around us.
Actually we won't.

122
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,550
We will not be particularly resilient.

123
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:26,660
And something very important,

124
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:30,410
which is actually widely known
in research in education,

125
00:08:30,411 --> 00:08:34,760
but it's not necessarily mirrored in our
educational systems as they function on

126
00:08:34,761 --> 00:08:37,370
the ground,
is that learning is a social experience.

127
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:41,450
Children learn from people they like.
Would you agree with that?

128
00:08:41,451 --> 00:08:45,680
From your experience in school, you didn't
have a relationship with the teacher?

129
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:49,370
How well did you do with that subject?
Yeah,

130
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:54,440
so in terms of how we take on new skills,

131
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:57,210
new information, new
knowledge, new awareness,

132
00:08:57,211 --> 00:09:02,211
those relationships are really key and
what we're seeing now in terms of people

133
00:09:02,641 --> 00:09:05,310
who have a developmental health problems,

134
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:09,030
what makes a difference is not somebody
painting your diagnosis on them and

135
00:09:09,031 --> 00:09:10,320
telling them what's wrong with them,

136
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:15,330
but it's actually people coming
together as a group in the community.

137
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:20,690
And thinking about their strengths and
thinking about what it is that empowers

138
00:09:21,121 --> 00:09:26,121
them to be able to overcome the challenges
that they're facing with their mental

139
00:09:26,251 --> 00:09:30,570
health. So the facts from
neuroscience about babies brains,

140
00:09:30,571 --> 00:09:33,630
and we've got a little exhibit
over here in the corner,

141
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:38,580
is that babies are born with
a hundred billion neurons.

142
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:43,020
Did you know that?
That's a lot of neurons rights,

143
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:48,210
but they're not connected. That's the
thing. There are there in the brain,

144
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:50,190
but they're not connected yet.

145
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:55,910
And so the waiting and they need that
social experience in order to connect the

146
00:09:56,281 --> 00:10:00,120
need, that interaction with
the adults around the baby,

147
00:10:00,121 --> 00:10:03,570
the baby needs that in order for
those connections to get made.

148
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:07,650
And by the age of, um, three,

149
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:12,920
what we're finding from neuroscience is
that about 85 to 90% of a baby's brain

150
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:18,870
is connected. So that's why the
first three years are so vital

151
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:25,480
and that baby's experience is going
to have a big impact on how they move

152
00:10:26,131 --> 00:10:27,870
forward.
So we're talking about foundation,

153
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:30,270
a foundational development of the brain.

154
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:34,950
Now it's important to know that actually
not all is lost if a baby has a poor

155
00:10:34,951 --> 00:10:36,370
experience.
Um,

156
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:40,650
some babies are born into families
where parents are not available,

157
00:10:40,651 --> 00:10:45,651
not able emotionally to take care of them
because they have maybe drug problems,

158
00:10:46,111 --> 00:10:46,960
alcohol problems.

159
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:51,960
So with ever depression gets in the way
and through no fault of the parent to no

160
00:10:53,131 --> 00:10:56,550
fault of their own, it can make
it difficult for them to connect.

161
00:10:56,610 --> 00:10:59,490
And for those babies,
if they do have a poor start,

162
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:04,390
the science shows that actually those,
those connections can develop,

163
00:11:04,391 --> 00:11:09,391
play to run if the baby has the
experience of the input for that.

164
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:16,370
So we also know from science
that the brain is like a muscle.

165
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,740
If we don't use it,
we lose it.

166
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:24,240
And certainly in Airlie development are
babies born with far more neurons than

167
00:11:24,241 --> 00:11:28,770
they actually need.
And so if they're not being stimulated,

168
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:32,790
the baby's not having a variety of social,
emotional,

169
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:35,070
cognitive experiences,

170
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:38,580
physical experiences than
those neurons don't connect up.

171
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:43,140
And actually what the neuroscience says,
they actually die away. They, they, they,

172
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:47,970
um, uh, wither and die if
they're not stimulated, not used.

173
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:52,920
And also
it's interesting because we're,

174
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,460
I think we're living in a world,

175
00:11:54,461 --> 00:11:58,420
we have been certainly through the
of the nineties, the, the era of,

176
00:11:58,421 --> 00:12:02,920
of kind of the frontal brain and
thinking a lot about talking a lot about

177
00:12:02,921 --> 00:12:07,180
cognition as rational thinking, but
actually what the science is saying now,

178
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,880
it's the social, uh, uh, influence,

179
00:12:10,881 --> 00:12:15,881
the social experience and maybe has that
has the greatest impact on the quality

180
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:21,660
of brain development.
And we know that the bay,

181
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,860
the brain builds from the base upwards.

182
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:26,800
So you have your very primitive
brain here at the back.

183
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:31,990
So baby's not born with the
higher structures built yet,

184
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:35,620
but they have the deeper
emotional structures.

185
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:40,180
And within that we have our primitive
brain, but also our emotional brain.

186
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:44,710
We know, you know, only too well,
that babies cry a lot, don't they?

187
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:48,760
Not Yours. Oh Wow. You're
very lucky. You're very lucky.

188
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:50,950
Not every parent will
have had that experience,

189
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:56,140
but babies cried from the primitive
brain because they're terrified.

190
00:12:56,141 --> 00:12:59,320
They've never been here
before. Actually, that depends.

191
00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:04,140
What do you believe in reincarnation or
not? But, um, when I say, uh, they've,

192
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:07,630
they don't know what to do.
They need the adults to guide them,

193
00:13:07,631 --> 00:13:08,770
to give them information,

194
00:13:08,771 --> 00:13:13,420
to help them make sense of
their experience in order
to feel safe and secure.

195
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:19,410
And so babies will work from
that primitive brain and
cry when things are scary

196
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:26,740
or the anxious or their
heart are in need of care.

197
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:28,983
Um,

198
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:33,160
and these circuits which are in the
deeper primitive brain and the emotional

199
00:13:33,161 --> 00:13:34,150
brand there,

200
00:13:34,151 --> 00:13:38,620
the structure is on which later brain
development gets built and how those

201
00:13:38,621 --> 00:13:43,510
structures are actually nurtured in the
first three years particularly is very

202
00:13:43,511 --> 00:13:47,350
important, uh, as, as
I'll go on to talk about,

203
00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:51,580
so that's a little picture of your brain.

204
00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:54,740
That's the one side.
Uh,

205
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:58,450
if somebody took a chainsaw
and cut your head and half,

206
00:13:58,451 --> 00:14:02,260
I hope that never happens to anybody in
the soldiers. And that's what you'll see.

207
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:06,670
And I'm here.
You've got these deeper structures,

208
00:14:06,671 --> 00:14:08,830
so it's not coming up very well with the,

209
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,900
so here you've got the deeper structures,

210
00:14:10,901 --> 00:14:15,040
the primitive brain and
that that goes across here.

211
00:14:15,041 --> 00:14:18,880
And down here is the emotional brain.
The limbic brain is called.

212
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:22,090
And in that you've got this
structure called the Amygdala,

213
00:14:22,091 --> 00:14:23,410
which is the alarm system.

214
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:29,220
And if you are frightened or if
you're anxious or if you're angry,

215
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:33,640
and some positive emotions are
connected to the mental as well,

216
00:14:33,641 --> 00:14:38,641
but very much connected with fear and
anxiety and threatened the ed experiences

217
00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:43,120
that where you perceived threat, you're
a middle and we'll go off to your alarm.

218
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:46,960
It's like the alarm in your house,
a fire alarm or your burglar alarm.

219
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:51,280
If something feels threatening, the alarm
will go off. And that will put you into,

220
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:55,150
you know this I'm sure fight,
flight or freeze. Yeah.

221
00:14:55,430 --> 00:15:00,430
And that propels you to react in
order to survive and protect yourself.

222
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:05,540
That's how we take care of,
take care of ourselves as humans.

223
00:15:05,541 --> 00:15:06,530
And it's how we survive.

224
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:11,180
So baby doesn't actually
have the higher brain.

225
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:16,660
So the part across the top and at the
front here is called the prefrontal

226
00:15:16,821 --> 00:15:19,880
cortex. Well, the whole, the whole
structure is called the cortex.

227
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:24,500
But this here is particularly
important is the prefrontal cortex.

228
00:15:24,501 --> 00:15:28,460
And that's the part of the
brain that used to think,

229
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:34,190
reflect. What else might you
use it for? You think? Planning,

230
00:15:34,191 --> 00:15:35,420
grades,
anything else?

231
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:42,280
Learning. Yes. Processing
information. Yep.

232
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,033
Sorry.

233
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:49,330
Predict. Brilliant. Yeah.
So to predict things,

234
00:15:49,331 --> 00:15:52,750
to be able to analyze information and
then make predictions to draw conclusions.

235
00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:54,440
Yeah.
Uh,

236
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:58,750
so we've got problem
solving in there as well.

237
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:02,470
Impulse control,
emotional regulation.

238
00:16:02,471 --> 00:16:06,010
So we need this part of our brain
to help to regulate our emotions.

239
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:11,310
So you can see how important it is that
the frontal lobe is connected to the

240
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:16,360
Amygdala, particularly that
limbic part of the brain.

241
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:19,660
Because those two parts of the
brain need to work in tandem.

242
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:22,510
Well for us to be able
to manage ourselves,

243
00:16:22,511 --> 00:16:27,511
particularly around our more primitive
emotions are impulse desiring something

244
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:32,110
in a moment. And you know, if we
make a rash decision, that's it,

245
00:16:32,111 --> 00:16:33,790
I'm going to have it.
That might,

246
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,000
that'll be the primitive brain making
the decision rather than you thinking

247
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:40,680
actually,
is this the right thing for me right now?

248
00:16:40,681 --> 00:16:44,620
Or is this a good thing to do as a
an honorable thing to do or whatever.

249
00:16:44,621 --> 00:16:47,710
So that helps us to make
moral choices as well.

250
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:48,943
Okay.

251
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:55,420
So that's just to give you
a picture of uh, the growth,

252
00:16:55,421 --> 00:17:00,421
the development of neuronal connections
from a newborn to adulthood.

253
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:06,290
That's, this is the adult one here. This
is covered. So you can see the, the,

254
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:11,291
the rapid development of connections that
happen and this is healthy development

255
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:14,890
where a baby is interacted
with and stimulated.

256
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:19,780
You see how those neuronal connections
get made and how they become abundant

257
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:22,420
because the more stimulation,

258
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:26,110
and now I have to qualify this because we,
we can,

259
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:29,710
I don't want any of you going home and
suddenly going to the library and getting

260
00:17:29,711 --> 00:17:34,630
20 bucks and doing that sort of what to
call that flash thing with your child,

261
00:17:34,631 --> 00:17:38,470
where you're showing them lots of
flashcards. It doesn't work like that.

262
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:41,560
The stimulation Ni as
I'll explain in a minute,

263
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:44,710
needs to be attuned to the baby.

264
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:48,190
And that's the problem
about going in with,

265
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:53,170
let's give them more stimulation
and then they'll get triple A's in,

266
00:17:53,171 --> 00:17:56,310
they're living starch when they're done.
It doesn't work like that.

267
00:17:56,311 --> 00:17:58,350
So the stimulation is important.

268
00:17:58,351 --> 00:18:02,310
But how does stimulate with comes in is
really crucial because what we could do

269
00:18:02,311 --> 00:18:07,311
is we can overwhelm the baby's brain
with stimulation and they could feel too

270
00:18:07,561 --> 00:18:09,780
much.
And I'll talk about that in a minute.

271
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:16,250
So let's have a look at this video or
some of it just aware of time is going

272
00:18:16,981 --> 00:18:19,260
very quickly.
There's lots of things I want to show you.

273
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:25,940
So this is to show you the importance
of social connection for a baby.

274
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:31,620
Um, so the baby's speaking for themselves
and it shows you what happens if that

275
00:18:31,621 --> 00:18:33,770
social connection gets taken away.
So it's,

276
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:38,760
it's an experiment that was created by
psychologists about 35 years ago to try

277
00:18:38,761 --> 00:18:43,620
and get into the experience of the
baby rather than trying to do lots of,

278
00:18:44,130 --> 00:18:48,450
you know, crunching lots of numbers,
really very much a social, emotional,

279
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:51,840
qualitative type of research.

280
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:56,370
So any thoughts about that?

281
00:18:58,350 --> 00:19:01,260
Are using their phones?
Phones?

282
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:02,401
Yeah,

283
00:19:02,401 --> 00:19:06,810
I think I'm using the tablets and all that
kind of stuff on is they're saying no,

284
00:19:06,811 --> 00:19:10,300
the kids are trying to best to get your
attention and you're just stuck in it.

285
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,510
So I think that's what
it made me think of.

286
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:17,940
Do you think about that? Yeah. Great. So
we can get preoccupied is adults, right?

287
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:23,450
And the reason I'm here is because people
need to know this information and once

288
00:19:23,821 --> 00:19:26,730
you have inflammation you
can be more aware, right?

289
00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:29,370
I don't blame parents
for getting it wrong,

290
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:34,950
but I think a good, I'm a parent
and my, my son's one grown up now,

291
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:38,160
but if I had this
information 33 years ago,

292
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:43,530
I think life would be a lot easier for
him now. But we learn and we can only,

293
00:19:43,531 --> 00:19:45,120
what I say to the parents I work with,

294
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:50,010
we can only work with the information
we have at any moment in time.

295
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,490
Our parents,
some of us who are older were told,

296
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:57,780
I mean my mum was told to push this down
the end of the field and leave us in

297
00:19:57,781 --> 00:20:01,290
the fresh air cause would make our
lungs stronger. So when we were crying,

298
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:05,310
nobody heard us and nobody came.
I've been in therapy since,

299
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:11,080
so, uh, so parents, you know, are,

300
00:20:11,130 --> 00:20:16,130
might not be aware and might be distracted
and work can be very demanding as all

301
00:20:16,411 --> 00:20:20,580
sorts of reasons why parents can get
taken away from their babies and their

302
00:20:20,581 --> 00:20:24,870
children. So, uh, his, here's the,

303
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:28,500
here's the science. Yeah. Anybody
else want to comment on that?

304
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:36,840
I mean,
apart from the parents kind of

305
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:40,770
shutting down in terms of reaction,
what's the difference?

306
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:43,350
I have two young boys by the way. I'm
like, for example, in the mornings,

307
00:20:43,351 --> 00:20:47,070
so we're getting ready. It's a mad house
and what we actually do quite regularly,

308
00:20:47,290 --> 00:20:49,180
okay. You know, there's an Ipad,

309
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:52,200
whatever cartoon of the flavor of
the month design in the moment,

310
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:54,820
the two of them, two and a half
year old and a one year old will,

311
00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:57,640
we'll shut up and watch the screen and
they'll be happy while we, you know,

312
00:20:57,790 --> 00:21:01,300
get dressed and get out the
door with them. Is there, is
that different, does that,

313
00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:03,820
is that like, because it's not
an actual human interaction,

314
00:21:03,821 --> 00:21:06,790
is that as as as ugly a thing?

315
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:11,620
So it's about the frequency
of being in contact,

316
00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:15,910
out of contact. That's the issue. So it's
not whether you do, I mean, you know,

317
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:20,440
let's face it, as parents, you have to
find strategies to manage. You know,

318
00:21:20,441 --> 00:21:24,340
you're a busy day. The demand, you've got
to get out to work. That's the reality.

319
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:29,270
Um, and so if you, if you
use a video, you know,

320
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:33,940
in the moment to help, you
know, keep the children from,

321
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:37,540
you know, running out the front door
or are climbing the walls or whatever,

322
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:42,310
that's, that's different from actually
children who are on screens incessantly or

323
00:21:42,311 --> 00:21:44,020
parents who are on screens incessantly.

324
00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:47,950
I'll go on to talk about what it is about
the social interaction that's so key.

325
00:21:48,370 --> 00:21:51,850
So, um, parenting just
needs to be good enough.

326
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:56,770
Is there a sigh of relief in the room? It
doesn't have to be perfect. And in fact,

327
00:21:57,040 --> 00:22:00,190
as I'll talk about perfect parenting,
so called, there's not such thing,

328
00:22:00,191 --> 00:22:05,170
but her parents want to be perfect. It
can be detrimental to their children. So,

329
00:22:05,410 --> 00:22:09,970
you know, uh, think about what
I'm saying and then, you know,

330
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,590
balance it out. Have a discussion and
think, you know, is this, is this okay?

331
00:22:14,591 --> 00:22:18,970
You probably is. If it's only in a
moment to get the job done. Yeah.

332
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:24,190
Okay. So you, some of you might have
been surprised by that baby's response.

333
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:24,681
You know,

334
00:22:24,681 --> 00:22:29,681
I don't traditionally have assumed that
babies were born with what's known as a,

335
00:22:29,771 --> 00:22:34,090
a kind of blank slate as a blank
slate, Tabula Rasa, um, you know,

336
00:22:34,091 --> 00:22:38,800
like a computer that just arrives
at your home. Uh, that's not been,

337
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:42,610
uh, uh, what you call it here.

338
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:48,850
Uh, programs. So that's
the idea. You know, I,

339
00:22:48,851 --> 00:22:53,050
I'm not very computer
literate. I have to admit. Um,

340
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:56,890
technology terrifies me most of the time,
but actually it's very much,

341
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:01,210
the previous thinking was very much like
that the baby arrives like the laptop,

342
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:04,900
the good comes in the post and I turn
it on and expect to just to work,

343
00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:07,210
not realizing it has to be programmed.

344
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:12,390
So we know now the babies are actually
born with innate capacities for

345
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:14,710
interacting and connecting,

346
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:20,310
which have a profound effect on their
development and how that's responded to.

347
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:24,820
And just in case you think this
is just a female phenomenon,

348
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:29,160
I want to show you this. It's
a bit a bit of this video. Um,

349
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:33,190
because you know,
traditionally women have been seen as the,

350
00:23:33,191 --> 00:23:36,310
as the important caregivers,
uh,

351
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:40,030
for babies and young children,
but actually dad,

352
00:23:40,031 --> 00:23:44,340
so just as important, it's a bad
relationship. It's not about your,

353
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:47,180
your gender.
Um,

354
00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:50,420
it's about the quality of the
relationship you bring to this child.

355
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:52,480
So why not,

356
00:23:52,490 --> 00:23:57,290
what is it the parents do
that builds that baby's brain?

357
00:23:57,830 --> 00:24:01,160
And we know from the research
there are five main things,

358
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:04,640
so five,
uh,

359
00:24:04,730 --> 00:24:08,090
building blocks of the brain
or a formula if you like,

360
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:12,950
a different type of formula, power from
their feeding formula, feeding the brain,

361
00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:16,580
uh,
in this case so the parent responds,

362
00:24:16,581 --> 00:24:21,581
so a baby and a child will
initiate when they want connection.

363
00:24:21,770 --> 00:24:25,490
So maybe connection just
to play and have some fun.

364
00:24:25,850 --> 00:24:30,110
It may be connection for stimulation
because they're bored or it may be

365
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,820
connection,
uh,

366
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:36,230
because they want to be calmed down and
suited and helped with their feelings

367
00:24:36,231 --> 00:24:38,750
because they can't do it for themselves.

368
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:41,960
And so in order for a parent
respond appropriately,

369
00:24:41,961 --> 00:24:46,940
what's very important is that the parent
is able to read the cues of the baby or

370
00:24:46,941 --> 00:24:48,710
the child.
Oh,

371
00:24:48,770 --> 00:24:53,600
I wonder if she's crying because she's
needs a nappy change or maybe she's

372
00:24:53,601 --> 00:24:55,670
hungry,
maybe she's bored.

373
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:59,960
Or maybe she's very frightened because
there was just a loud noise went off next

374
00:24:59,961 --> 00:25:02,720
door. And that's really, really key.

375
00:25:02,870 --> 00:25:07,640
And that asks for your intuitive judgment.

376
00:25:08,030 --> 00:25:13,030
So your brain connecting with your body
to help you to attune and empathize with

377
00:25:14,751 --> 00:25:16,670
what it is that the baby is needing.

378
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:19,940
And actually for new parents
that can take time, right?

379
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:25,010
When you have first have a
baby, it's like, oh my God,
what do I do with this? Um,

380
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:29,300
for all parents.
But you get into the baby's rhythm,

381
00:25:29,301 --> 00:25:30,320
you get to know your baby,

382
00:25:30,321 --> 00:25:35,321
your baby gets to know you and you
actually learn the baby's temperament,

383
00:25:37,131 --> 00:25:39,530
which is very important because
no two babies are the same.

384
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:43,670
And that's very important.
If any of you have gone,

385
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:48,110
if you go onto the internet
to use parenting books
because sometimes the blogs

386
00:25:48,111 --> 00:25:53,111
and the books will actually present
stock responses for all babies controlled

387
00:25:55,451 --> 00:25:59,060
crying. It's one of them when
the child is older. Timeout.

388
00:25:59,450 --> 00:26:03,320
But actually if our babies and
our children are individual,

389
00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:06,890
they will need an individual
response, which is, uh,

390
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:12,040
comes from the moment from you perceiving
what it is that they actually need

391
00:26:12,530 --> 00:26:13,363
from you.

392
00:26:14,390 --> 00:26:19,390
So we need to notice the baby's needs
and read those cues and then respond to

393
00:26:21,511 --> 00:26:24,710
pro APP as a CI tuned way as
possible. It doesn't, again,

394
00:26:24,711 --> 00:26:29,360
it doesn't have to be perfect.
And then the second element of,

395
00:26:29,490 --> 00:26:34,010
uh,
what a parent does is to use contact.

396
00:26:34,190 --> 00:26:35,780
So for,
for young babies,

397
00:26:35,781 --> 00:26:38,810
we picked them up and with color
color them and we hold them a lot.

398
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:42,350
And we know from research by the
age of about six to nine months,

399
00:26:42,351 --> 00:26:47,040
babies start to need less and less,
uh,

400
00:26:47,130 --> 00:26:51,630
picking up and holding, but they still
need contact and neither us to, to,

401
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:56,740
um, to give them cuddles, to comfort
them when they're distressed. Um,

402
00:26:56,790 --> 00:26:58,760
but as a child develops that,

403
00:26:58,790 --> 00:27:02,760
that need for a con
consumer holding reduces.

404
00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:06,750
Um, and uh, and that physical contact,

405
00:27:06,751 --> 00:27:11,751
that touch is absolutely vital for the
brain and the body to develop two to wire

406
00:27:12,811 --> 00:27:17,580
up, but also for those feel good hormones
to come in. So we've got oxytocin,

407
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:20,250
dopamine,
Serotonin,

408
00:27:21,330 --> 00:27:25,060
dopamine is a very important
hormone for learning and for,

409
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:29,850
for focus and attention. And, uh,
oxytocin, I don't know if you know,

410
00:27:29,851 --> 00:27:33,120
but it's labeled the
love hormone. So we, we,

411
00:27:33,121 --> 00:27:35,040
we stimulate the air.

412
00:27:35,130 --> 00:27:40,130
We secrete oxytocin when we come into
any loving or intimate contact with

413
00:27:40,561 --> 00:27:43,200
another person. So it could be a
lovely experience with a friend.

414
00:27:43,201 --> 00:27:45,840
It doesn't have to be a romantic partner,

415
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:50,430
but parents and children's stimulate
the production of oxytocin in each other

416
00:27:50,490 --> 00:27:54,870
when they interact in joyful,
a interactive experiences.

417
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:59,850
Um, the other important thing about
the touches actually helps us to, uh,

418
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:03,510
learn to, uh, feel
ourselves in our bodies.

419
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:06,150
And that kind of might seem a
bit of a strange thing to say,

420
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:09,180
but really a feeling embodied,

421
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:13,950
putting grounded in your own body
and connected to all of your organs.

422
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:17,610
Because a lot of our emotions,
uh,

423
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:22,710
that our ability to perceive our emotions
comes from our viscera. They come,

424
00:28:22,711 --> 00:28:27,711
the Vegas nerve passes right down
from the brain into our vital organs,

425
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:32,220
lungs, throat, uh, kidneys, stomach,

426
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:37,760
and an order for us to be able to know
how we feel and to be able to then

427
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:41,850
communicate that we need to be
able to perceive those emotions.

428
00:28:41,851 --> 00:28:46,680
And if we're cut off, my buddies
weren't able to do that. So the third,

429
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:48,660
uh, element of, of, of, uh,

430
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:52,710
what up for the parent does to build
the baby's brain is actually how they

431
00:28:52,711 --> 00:28:54,000
manage their own emotions.

432
00:28:54,690 --> 00:28:59,690
So a parent being able to regulate
themselves are ourselves homework,

433
00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:05,790
upset, distressed, angry, that
before we respond to our baby,

434
00:29:05,791 --> 00:29:09,150
we check how am I feeling? Oh,
well, I'm feeling really angry.

435
00:29:09,151 --> 00:29:11,820
Maybe now's not the time
for me to deal with this.

436
00:29:11,821 --> 00:29:13,740
So maybe I'll get my
partner to deal with it.

437
00:29:14,190 --> 00:29:16,710
And so it's just going to
this slide to show you,

438
00:29:16,711 --> 00:29:21,711
it's the idea of securing your
own oxygen mask before you secure.

439
00:29:21,911 --> 00:29:24,000
As you know,
when you're on an airplane and they say,

440
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:27,480
put your own oxygen mask on
before you put on your chiles.

441
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,400
And I've always taught that
sounded counterintuitive.

442
00:29:30,450 --> 00:29:31,590
But when you think about it,

443
00:29:32,010 --> 00:29:37,010
actually you can't save somebody else
unless you're actually protected yourself.

444
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:42,130
So similarly with your own
emotions, you can't regulate, um,

445
00:29:42,630 --> 00:29:46,570
uh, a baby or a child, a young
child unless you're regulated.

446
00:29:47,050 --> 00:29:51,850
Because remember what I said about the
neuro chemicals. Have they, uh, get, uh,

447
00:29:51,910 --> 00:29:56,170
triggered? How'd they get stimulated
between us, between our brains,

448
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:59,590
our two brains interacting with
each other and our bodies too.

449
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:02,860
If we're angry or we're very anxious,

450
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:08,070
then the baby or the child's
neuro biological system
will pick that up and those

451
00:30:09,251 --> 00:30:12,430
corresponding emotions
will be triggered in them.

452
00:30:12,850 --> 00:30:17,020
So really paying attention to
our own arousal levels, uh,

453
00:30:17,290 --> 00:30:22,290
and trying to calm ourselves down in
order to be able to come them down is very

454
00:30:23,111 --> 00:30:27,910
important. And actually what's really
key to know is that babies actually learn

455
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:34,440
to regulate their, not just their
emotions, but their whole rhythms,

456
00:30:34,441 --> 00:30:39,400
circadian rhythms through the physical
holding from the parents. I met,

457
00:30:39,401 --> 00:30:43,870
I met all of these five things actually
for particularly the physical holding.

458
00:30:44,170 --> 00:30:46,500
So when a baby cries,
a,

459
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:50,590
that will trigger some discomfort in
new quite naturally as parent because

460
00:30:50,591 --> 00:30:55,591
that's nature's way of making sure that
you don't sit and continue watching game

461
00:30:55,841 --> 00:31:00,100
of Thrones on TV, that you
actually respond to the baby.
Otherwise you might not.

462
00:31:00,430 --> 00:31:04,420
So we are made uncomfortable,
which propels us into responding.

463
00:31:05,290 --> 00:31:10,290
And then what happens is as we hold the
baby and we start to calm the baby and

464
00:31:11,621 --> 00:31:16,621
sued the baby are Razah level
comes down and the baby finds out,

465
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:22,810
ah, that's how you calm down. This
is, oh, that's very interesting.

466
00:31:23,290 --> 00:31:25,810
Obviously not because babies
don't have condition yet,

467
00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:30,370
but the baby's system learns.
It's a training procedure.

468
00:31:30,610 --> 00:31:32,350
This is how you calm down.
Watch Mommy,

469
00:31:32,351 --> 00:31:35,890
watch daddy as mommy and daddy calm down.

470
00:31:36,010 --> 00:31:40,510
The baby's system gets that
information and over and over and over,

471
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,720
true time,
the baby's system,

472
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:47,440
a babies rounds of system,
you're a biological system.

473
00:31:47,770 --> 00:31:52,510
Brain body is able to do that for
themselves when they get, it's a stressed,

474
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:56,440
anxious subset. So does that
make sense? So we don't,

475
00:31:57,400 --> 00:32:00,250
we don't, we're not born with the
capacity to emotionally regulate.

476
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:01,600
We have to learn it.

477
00:32:02,230 --> 00:32:06,580
And we learned it as babies and young
children from the adults around us

478
00:32:06,910 --> 00:32:10,930
regulating themselves and
then showing us how it's done.

479
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:15,970
You can imagine if a parent, you
know, and you all parents get angry,

480
00:32:15,971 --> 00:32:18,640
I get frustrated and get anxious.
That's quite natural.

481
00:32:19,150 --> 00:32:22,180
But as long as it's not
continuous and all the time,

482
00:32:22,181 --> 00:32:27,160
then that's not going to have a
detrimental effect on the child. But,

483
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:31,360
um, you can imagine being around
somebody who's very angry all the time.

484
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:35,160
What does that do to you? What does the,
how does that make your system fail?

485
00:32:35,190 --> 00:32:37,210
I not just talking about your thoughts,

486
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:42,410
but also your whole big,
what does that feel like?

487
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:45,660
Would you imagine?
And not food.

488
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:50,180
He might feel threatened and
undressed under attack as a,

489
00:32:50,181 --> 00:32:53,640
put you one kind of defense in
a defensive mode because it's,

490
00:32:53,730 --> 00:32:58,320
what's happening is those stress hormones
are cascading round your body because

491
00:32:58,321 --> 00:33:01,380
there'd been triggered by the
other person's level of emotions.

492
00:33:02,790 --> 00:33:06,420
And that's why it's so important that
we're really thinking about it on

493
00:33:06,421 --> 00:33:08,180
regulation.
Uh,

494
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:13,440
as we're looking after our babies and
our children and of course each other,

495
00:33:13,441 --> 00:33:16,570
because similarly you will have a similar,
uh,

496
00:33:16,590 --> 00:33:19,440
experience with a partner of friends.

497
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:22,770
If they're constantly disregulated,

498
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:26,040
then you're going to pick that
up and you're going to feel that.

499
00:33:27,570 --> 00:33:32,570
And then the fourth component of
what pens to is clay now playing,

500
00:33:34,561 --> 00:33:36,690
we all know it's a good
idea to play with the child.

501
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:40,830
But here we're not just talking
about in know, playing together,

502
00:33:40,831 --> 00:33:43,720
playing a board game together or uh,

503
00:33:43,770 --> 00:33:47,880
reading the mystery or,
um, playing a board game.

504
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:52,770
We're talking about right from
the very beginning with an infant,

505
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:58,400
the face to face interaction that happens
between parents and child and how that

506
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:03,690
has a huge impact on how
the brain connects up.

507
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:09,380
So when you see a baby and you
go to interact with a baby,

508
00:34:09,411 --> 00:34:10,910
what do you find yourself doing?

509
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:15,680
Have you noticed if some of you might
not have been around a baby recently,

510
00:34:15,681 --> 00:34:20,330
but what do you notice yourself doing?
You lean in. What else do you do?

511
00:34:21,170 --> 00:34:24,950
You smile, you make, well,

512
00:34:25,430 --> 00:34:28,340
they don't think they're silly.
I don't think they're silly,

513
00:34:28,550 --> 00:34:33,080
but we start to make these noises.
He sounds, what are the, sounds like?

514
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:38,650
Does anybody want to do a demonstration?

515
00:34:43,810 --> 00:34:48,460
So you raise the pitch of your voice.
Very important. What else do you do?

516
00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:55,980
Expressing you become more expressive.
Your face.

517
00:34:56,250 --> 00:35:00,090
You saw that mom when she may engage,
she was very animated.

518
00:35:00,710 --> 00:35:04,500
So you and you look excited,
interested and excited.

519
00:35:04,890 --> 00:35:08,610
Very important.
You start to intimate your words,

520
00:35:08,790 --> 00:35:11,640
you elongate them.
Um,

521
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:15,200
and you do a rhythmical
voice. Oh No. Could you,

522
00:35:15,270 --> 00:35:18,660
aren't you so good today?

523
00:35:19,350 --> 00:35:24,150
Has Anybody talked to the
partner like that? Believe me,

524
00:35:24,151 --> 00:35:28,770
I had some people living in my house
once and they did and it was really

525
00:35:28,771 --> 00:35:32,570
irritating, but mostly adults. Dope.

526
00:35:32,590 --> 00:35:36,990
But we'd find ourselves as an innate
drive to do that with babies isn't

527
00:35:37,170 --> 00:35:42,120
interesting because it's called
infant directed speech in,

528
00:35:42,121 --> 00:35:45,370
in science.
But we talk about parenting.

529
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:47,220
These are baby talk.

530
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:52,820
But it's so important because it's the
building blocks of social interaction.

531
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:56,700
Babies learn.
One had to make eye contact.

532
00:35:57,660 --> 00:36:02,580
They learn how to turn take. So
I have a goal. You have a goal.

533
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:06,540
My turn. Your turn. What,
what is that important for?

534
00:36:08,730 --> 00:36:11,910
Having conversations where people,
social conversations,

535
00:36:12,330 --> 00:36:15,750
do you know people who don't
try and take very well? Yeah.

536
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:20,970
Um, so that is very important because
it helps us to connect the timing.

537
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:23,880
All of that needs very precise judgment.

538
00:36:23,881 --> 00:36:27,870
And babies learned that from their
parents doing that face to face.

539
00:36:28,050 --> 00:36:33,050
They also learn about how to
read other people's emotions.

540
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:38,850
So if I'm looking at you and you look sad,

541
00:36:40,390 --> 00:36:43,530
no, you're doing it right
there. So if you're a baby,

542
00:36:43,531 --> 00:36:48,480
I might sit all that and
what I do as a parent,

543
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:52,710
as an adult, if I'm emotionally
attuned and I'm an empathic,

544
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:57,720
I'll display that emotion on my face and
then we'll get reflected back to you.

545
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:01,980
And what I'd be saying too is I get
it. I get it. You're really sad.

546
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:07,020
The baby feels great when that
happens, as opposed to, Oh,

547
00:37:07,021 --> 00:37:10,470
you look really happy. The
baby's like, no, I'm not.

548
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:14,580
But they can't tell us that. But they
might cry because we didn't get them.

549
00:37:15,030 --> 00:37:19,200
That's called misattunement.
So when we do that, oh,

550
00:37:19,201 --> 00:37:23,700
you look so sad. We're giving them
the information about that emotion.

551
00:37:23,910 --> 00:37:28,590
This was what's sad. Looks like you're
sad. I'm resonating with the emotion.

552
00:37:28,591 --> 00:37:29,580
That's the empathy.

553
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:34,470
And I teach my child how to
understand their own emotions,

554
00:37:34,471 --> 00:37:39,471
how to read other people's emotions
and how to develop the vocabulary.

555
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:40,350
Sad.

556
00:37:40,350 --> 00:37:44,640
So now I have a word for sad because my
mommy and my daddy tells me what's sad

557
00:37:44,641 --> 00:37:48,870
is, Oh, if you're not coming with the
feed quickly enough and the baby's crying.

558
00:37:48,871 --> 00:37:53,440
Angalee and my said, oh, you're
really angry with mommy or daddy,

559
00:37:53,850 --> 00:37:55,980
but you're not angry
when you're saying that.

560
00:37:56,190 --> 00:38:00,060
But you're helping the baby to
understand what that emotion is.

561
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:06,020
All of that and much more comes from
those face to face interactions,

562
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:07,350
which are so key.

563
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:14,580
And then we have talk, which
is the conversation, the words,

564
00:38:14,581 --> 00:38:18,070
the language. And you can see how
these are all interlinked. You know,

565
00:38:18,090 --> 00:38:21,090
we do all of these in the blank for now.
We don't break them down and say,

566
00:38:21,091 --> 00:38:22,920
right now I'm going to talk to you.

567
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:28,770
We actually do everything we, we
look and we go on to. So beautiful.

568
00:38:29,370 --> 00:38:32,490
We start to use the language.
And we use the,

569
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:35,010
the infant directed
speech because that is,

570
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:39,100
gives the baby the basis of language.
It's cold,

571
00:38:39,130 --> 00:38:42,220
they're cold protal conversations
where we're having this conversation.

572
00:38:42,670 --> 00:38:45,550
You make a sound,
I echo back the sound to you.

573
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:50,560
Like you might say God got guys,
babies often say not yet but it's coming.

574
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:55,840
Um, and so I was attuned. Parents
do is they reflect back the sun,

575
00:38:55,841 --> 00:38:58,120
the mirror, the sand back
to the baby, go, go, go.

576
00:38:58,540 --> 00:39:02,180
And that is the building
blocks of language teachers,

577
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:06,370
a baby about the social, particularly
the social aspects of language.

578
00:39:06,370 --> 00:39:10,960
But there's so much more in there with
the play in the top because it says your

579
00:39:10,990 --> 00:39:13,930
really important,
you're a valuable human being.

580
00:39:14,230 --> 00:39:18,490
You are deserving of my time and
attention and my focus and I'm really

581
00:39:18,491 --> 00:39:22,810
interested in you. So the excitement
is a really key part of this.

582
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:27,210
The animation, because I'm saying
to my baby, I so interested in,

583
00:39:27,211 --> 00:39:29,710
in you and I really love
interacting with you.

584
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:32,950
You failed that and that
affects your physiology.

585
00:39:33,510 --> 00:39:36,520
It affects the babies for the
physiology and your mirror each other.

586
00:39:36,521 --> 00:39:41,020
And that is a perfect storm for
communication. This works well.

587
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:46,030
Is there any science around the, uh,
uh, affect that younger siblings? Yeah,

588
00:39:46,070 --> 00:39:47,050
because I,

589
00:39:47,450 --> 00:39:51,530
my third child definitely got
way less than my first or,

590
00:39:51,590 --> 00:39:55,970
or even second child because
you're so busy. Yeah. Yeah.
With the other older ones.

591
00:39:56,020 --> 00:39:56,810
Yeah.

592
00:39:56,810 --> 00:39:58,910
Yeah.
And I was nine of 12,

593
00:40:01,130 --> 00:40:04,700
so I know what you're
talking about. Um, yeah,

594
00:40:04,701 --> 00:40:09,060
I guess it's difficult when you're, the
more children you have, the more your, um,

595
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:14,070
demands there are on your
resources, your intention, your
focus, your time, your, uh,

596
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:18,400
you know, your capacity or energy. That's
the hard thing about being parents.

597
00:40:18,430 --> 00:40:20,970
I've been having a number of children.
Um,

598
00:40:21,230 --> 00:40:24,230
I don't know specifically
about research in relation.

599
00:40:24,231 --> 00:40:28,700
There's lots of research on
sibling. Uh, I'm on birth order.

600
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:34,010
Um, and you know, there are differences,
uh, in relation to that. Um,

601
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:37,280
but you know, when I want you
to go away with is knowing this,

602
00:40:37,281 --> 00:40:42,110
but also knowing that, um, children
just need enough, you know,

603
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:43,970
we need to be just good enough as parents.

604
00:40:44,330 --> 00:40:48,560
And one of the problems currently
it's called helicopter parenting,

605
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:52,880
where parents are so hyper
anxious about being good enough,

606
00:40:53,510 --> 00:40:57,860
they're actually hampering their
child's development. So you know,

607
00:40:58,670 --> 00:41:02,270
this is why the first three years is
so key because you're building the

608
00:41:02,271 --> 00:41:04,860
foundations of a house.

609
00:41:04,890 --> 00:41:08,330
I was creating the structural foundations,

610
00:41:08,510 --> 00:41:13,010
which then the house gets built on
strong foundations and then you'll have a

611
00:41:13,011 --> 00:41:16,370
strong house. So as children, uh,

612
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:18,500
we know from the research that,
um,

613
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:22,730
children need to start cutting amount to
have babies even needs a certain amount

614
00:41:22,731 --> 00:41:26,480
of challenge to be able
to learn to be resilient.

615
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:31,840
So when mom stopped talking to
this baby and the baby got upset,

616
00:41:33,620 --> 00:41:36,290
that wasn't damaging for that baby.

617
00:41:36,890 --> 00:41:39,110
It would have been if
mom hadn't come back.

618
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:45,520
What happened was the baby started to
use their resources to just see what was

619
00:41:45,561 --> 00:41:48,560
going on with the baby. What
would they, what was she doing?

620
00:41:50,830 --> 00:41:53,810
She was trying to get mum back.
So she was raising her hands.

621
00:41:53,811 --> 00:41:56,870
They played the game. So in her
memory systems, there's this game,

622
00:41:57,050 --> 00:42:00,770
this work before this has helped
us connect. Um, she points,

623
00:42:00,771 --> 00:42:04,460
she does a number of things and then
she does something called amplification.

624
00:42:04,461 --> 00:42:07,160
She starts to increase the
intensity of her communication,

625
00:42:07,490 --> 00:42:11,420
her voice and her body language. Because
if you're not getting it, the child,

626
00:42:11,450 --> 00:42:15,980
you know this, I mean have you have
young children, they will up the ante.

627
00:42:16,730 --> 00:42:20,900
And that's because it's so terrifying
to be disconnected from your parent and

628
00:42:20,901 --> 00:42:24,410
you're, you're afraid as a small
charge. You don't have the, the, uh,

629
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:28,640
mechanisms to be able to think, actually
daddy's gone. But he's coming back.

630
00:42:28,641 --> 00:42:28,851
I mean,

631
00:42:28,851 --> 00:42:33,680
that takes some time to develop that on
that security and that understanding or

632
00:42:33,681 --> 00:42:35,930
daddy's going to never
got to talk to me again.

633
00:42:35,930 --> 00:42:40,140
Fear is of abandonment and of
losing a parent's love. So, um,

634
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:45,350
important to know that resilience is
built from a certain amount of challenge.

635
00:42:45,351 --> 00:42:50,351
So what Phil's resilience for this child
is that she is trying these different

636
00:42:50,841 --> 00:42:55,841
things to get mom back and then mum
responds and that helps her to feel

637
00:42:56,390 --> 00:42:57,320
masterful.

638
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:01,760
It helps her to feel I can have
an effect on somebody else.

639
00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:05,690
See what I can do and my mommy's
not paying attention to me,

640
00:43:05,930 --> 00:43:10,070
I can get mum back. So what's important
is that it becomes predictable,

641
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:11,913
um,

642
00:43:11,930 --> 00:43:16,930
that the parent has read
the baby's signals or the
child signals and accurately

643
00:43:17,450 --> 00:43:20,670
and emotionally attuned. Oh,
I'm sorry I was there somewhere.

644
00:43:20,671 --> 00:43:23,480
I think my head was somewhere else.
I'm sorry I wasn't listening to you.

645
00:43:23,481 --> 00:43:26,930
What did you want to tell me?
Isn't that what we do as parents?

646
00:43:27,590 --> 00:43:32,570
And so it's not coming back in and
really acknowledging the child's,

647
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:35,750
uh, effort. It's all you really
wanted to get my attention.

648
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:40,520
That helps the child to feel,
yeah, I could get my money
back and my dad did back.

649
00:43:40,521 --> 00:43:41,870
I can make things happen.

650
00:43:42,770 --> 00:43:47,770
So what's important is the repair is the
reconnection between parent and child.

651
00:43:49,100 --> 00:43:54,050
So, you know, if you lose the
connection temporarily, that's okay.

652
00:43:54,260 --> 00:43:57,110
It just needs to be repaired.
If you shout at your child,

653
00:43:57,111 --> 00:44:01,700
would you will do cause you're
human. Yeah. Right then,

654
00:44:02,570 --> 00:44:05,810
I'm sorry I shouted at
you mummies. Uh, you know,

655
00:44:05,811 --> 00:44:08,660
having a bad day today and I shouldn't
have showed them sorry for doing that.

656
00:44:09,230 --> 00:44:14,060
That's what builds resilience, not the
fact that you're never shatter your child,

657
00:44:14,540 --> 00:44:16,400
but that you shouted and you repaired.

658
00:44:18,380 --> 00:44:23,350
So we're just about to finish. Um,
but that, that uh, what I was saying,

659
00:44:23,351 --> 00:44:27,320
yeah, you're right about the stimulation.
Assimilation needs to be in tune.

660
00:44:27,321 --> 00:44:31,620
So as you're interacting with your babies
or your child is reading their body

661
00:44:31,621 --> 00:44:32,454
language.

662
00:44:32,490 --> 00:44:36,180
So if we're bombarding them
with flashcards because we
want them to do better in

663
00:44:36,181 --> 00:44:40,620
English, I'd leaving cert and there are
gone of cringing and tried to pull away.

664
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:44,430
That's a communication that
they're overwhelmed. It's too much,

665
00:44:44,431 --> 00:44:46,050
it's too difficult.
Um,

666
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:51,200
so constantly reading body language and
the cues that are given off so that we

667
00:44:51,421 --> 00:44:55,500
can actually work out how much to engage,

668
00:44:55,830 --> 00:45:00,360
how often for how long, um,
is the most helpful thing.

669
00:45:00,870 --> 00:45:04,670
And as I said, well, it's
really empowering for a baby.

670
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:07,530
The small child is that they
know they have an impact on you.

671
00:45:07,740 --> 00:45:11,880
If they try to connect with you and
you respond, that's very empowering.

672
00:45:11,881 --> 00:45:13,620
If they lose you when you come back,

673
00:45:13,950 --> 00:45:17,400
that's very empowering and
that is what builds resilience.

674
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:22,620
So Dan Siegel lose an American
psychologist, a psychotherapist says,

675
00:45:22,830 --> 00:45:26,760
we now know that the way to help a child
develop optimally is to help her create

676
00:45:26,761 --> 00:45:31,761
connections in our brain or whole brain
adaptive about skills that lead to

677
00:45:32,191 --> 00:45:36,960
better relationships, better mental
health, and more, uh, meaningful lives.

678
00:45:36,990 --> 00:45:41,610
You could call it brain sculpting or
brain building, whatever phase you prefer.

679
00:45:41,790 --> 00:45:45,270
The point is crucial and trilling as
a result of the words we use and the

680
00:45:45,271 --> 00:45:46,200
emotions we take,

681
00:45:46,470 --> 00:45:51,030
children's brains will actually change
and be built as they undergo new

682
00:45:51,031 --> 00:45:51,864
experiences.

683
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:56,100
And that leaves a positive note
that the brain is plastic for life.

684
00:45:56,910 --> 00:45:58,920
Very important for somebody
of my age to know that.

685
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:04,640
But we have periods of growth
and proliferation and so
we reorganization between

686
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:10,020
about 11 and 24 but the brain can change,

687
00:46:10,380 --> 00:46:14,820
change the experience of the outside
world and the brain will change,

688
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:19,770
change the way we interact with
children and their brains will change.

689
00:46:20,310 --> 00:46:21,480
Thank you all very much for this.

690
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:25,720
[inaudible].
