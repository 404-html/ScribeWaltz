1
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:10,500
[inaudible]

2
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:12,480
but it's nice to be back.
I mean,

3
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:16,980
Google's one of my homes and it
feels really comfortable to be here.

4
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:18,750
Um,
hiring,

5
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:25,020
um, you know, when I, uh,

6
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:29,620
I have to just acknowledge,
I have my publisher here, uh,

7
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:33,960
Mark Tavor who's the publisher of Harper
one which is one of the imprints of

8
00:00:33,961 --> 00:00:38,961
Harper Collins and the best imprint
because all those special books that you

9
00:00:39,541 --> 00:00:42,270
read, the sacred books, the books
that had really deep meaning,

10
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:44,630
they published them and
they're on their lists.

11
00:00:44,631 --> 00:00:49,590
So then it's something to really
think about. But I remember, um,

12
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:53,850
when I started writing this book,
which was about 35 years ago,

13
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:55,680
um,

14
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:00,300
any number of times I stopped writing
it in part because it was so much about

15
00:01:00,301 --> 00:01:03,810
me. And, uh, as Gandhi said,

16
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:09,440
there becomes a moment when the self
is too much with you and you can't even

17
00:01:10,171 --> 00:01:11,004
abide it.

18
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:15,720
So there's no way in the world that I
would agree to have my photo on a book or

19
00:01:15,721 --> 00:01:16,770
to have my name on it.

20
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:23,030
Here it is my photo and my name and a
lot of the things about writing a book

21
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:30,300
become weird when you're writing a memoir,
but about a year ago,

22
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:34,290
because of the vitriol,
the anger, the hatred,

23
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:38,610
the Shazam that has occurred
in American politics,

24
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:42,240
this book got a changed for me

25
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:48,740
because at its heart it is a story of
two miracles and it is a story of an

26
00:01:51,511 --> 00:01:56,511
amazing time in the middle of the Cold
War when Russia and the United States had

27
00:01:58,081 --> 00:02:00,960
40,000 nuclear weapons
pointed at each other,

28
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:07,160
and instead we buried those hatchets
and we worked together to conquer one of

29
00:02:09,061 --> 00:02:10,680
the worst diseases in human history,

30
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:16,660
a disease which had killed half a
billion people in the 20th century.

31
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:19,620
When I got the Ted Prize,

32
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:24,180
I had Larry and Sergei and the audience
and I said in the year that they were

33
00:02:24,181 --> 00:02:27,540
born, which was pretty
close to the summer of love,

34
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,020
there were 3 million people
who died of smallpox.

35
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:33,600
So it's not like it's not ancient history.

36
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:39,420
So what I'm going to do today is I'm
going to spend about 15 minutes and give

37
00:02:39,421 --> 00:02:41,890
you a little story of what's in the book.
Uh,

38
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:46,710
some of the pictures and three pictures
in particular that I didn't know when I

39
00:02:46,711 --> 00:02:51,711
was here working at Google existed and
I only found them using Google search.

40
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:56,870
I have a friend Ramdass some of you know
who he is and he went to the Costco and

41
00:02:56,871 --> 00:03:01,871
Maui and this was the book was out
and the book was there between Bruce

42
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:07,320
Springsteen and Harry Potter. I
thought that was a good omen. Um,

43
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:12,280
Peter said I caught some breaks.
That is the understatement of my life.

44
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,940
Um,
in 1962,

45
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:20,650
I was a sophomore going into my junior
year at University of Michigan in Ann

46
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:23,890
Arbor and I saw a little note that Martin
Luther King was going to be on campus

47
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:27,280
and it was just a tiny little
mention in the Michigan daily.

48
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:31,270
And Martin Luther King wasn't famous yet.
They hadn't won his Nobel prize.

49
00:03:31,271 --> 00:03:32,710
There hadn't been the Mississippi summer.

50
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:38,160
And I have no idea what made me get out
off my ass and go walk down to the hall

51
00:03:40,571 --> 00:03:44,740
that he was speaking and see him.
And if you ever been there in Arbor,

52
00:03:44,741 --> 00:03:47,020
you know that while in
the rest of the world,

53
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:52,050
rain comes vertically in Ann Arbor under
certain atmospheric conditions that

54
00:03:52,811 --> 00:03:55,660
goes horizontally and you
just can't walk into it.

55
00:03:55,661 --> 00:03:59,710
And it was that kind of a day and very
few people showed up for his talk.

56
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:01,540
You can see all the empty seats.

57
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:06,430
This is a hill auditorium that seated
4,000 people and there were only a couple

58
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:09,610
hundred of us. So what Martin
Luther King said was, hey listen,

59
00:04:09,611 --> 00:04:11,950
that means there'll be
more of me to go around.

60
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:14,050
You all come up on stage and sit with me.

61
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:18,430
And we sat with him on that stage
and in front of him for six hours.

62
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:23,800
None of us were ever the same. We all
went down to Mississippi, Alabama.

63
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:26,650
We all joined an alphabet
soup of activist groups,

64
00:04:26,651 --> 00:04:30,820
snick and core and NAACP,
SDS.

65
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:35,380
We were all changed because what he
talked about was a world not just in which

66
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:38,790
children or be judged by the
content of their character,

67
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:40,030
not the color of their skin,

68
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:45,840
not just about the arc of the moral
universe that not bends towards justice on

69
00:04:46,961 --> 00:04:47,794
its own.

70
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:51,700
But you've got to jump up and grab
that arc and pull it down and twist it.

71
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:55,420
So there's something that you can
do to make the world a better place.

72
00:04:55,421 --> 00:04:58,030
And none of us had ever heard that before.
I had never heard that before.

73
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:03,690
I had never heard anybody talk about the
long sweep of history and being able to

74
00:05:04,481 --> 00:05:06,070
enter into it and do anything good.

75
00:05:06,071 --> 00:05:10,870
Nobody had ever told me that
any of us could do that.

76
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:14,740
So that changed me. And,
and, and by the way,

77
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:18,910
I would not know that that photo
existed if it hadn't been for Google.

78
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:23,290
Because when I would tell this
story before, people said, well,

79
00:05:23,291 --> 00:05:27,250
Martin Luther King never was at Michigan
and there was no record that he was

80
00:05:27,251 --> 00:05:30,850
there. And, uh, when I went over
to the Skoll global threats fund,

81
00:05:30,851 --> 00:05:33,750
Jeff Skoll said to me, you're
not making this shit up, are you?

82
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:37,660
He said that about a lot of things.
And I, I said, well, let's look.

83
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:42,280
And we found the Bentley historical
museum at the University of Michigan had

84
00:05:42,281 --> 00:05:47,230
just gone online and this photo was just
available for the first time of Martin

85
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:52,180
Luther King going to Michigan. So, um,
I was in many ways a conventional kid.

86
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:53,770
I grew up in Detroit,
Michigan.

87
00:05:53,771 --> 00:05:58,690
There were a couple of things
that were not conventional
about my wife. And, um, I,

88
00:05:58,691 --> 00:06:01,970
it does bother me that that's the
picture she keeps with me hidden,

89
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:07,210
hidden behind the peace symbol.
But we were activists by then. Uh,

90
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,440
those of you who think
that's a Mercedes symbol,

91
00:06:09,441 --> 00:06:12,680
it's almost the same
thing but very different.

92
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:17,630
And then I became a real activist and
I went to medical school and I got on a

93
00:06:17,631 --> 00:06:21,600
white coat with an ostentatious
stethoscope dangling out of my side.

94
00:06:21,601 --> 00:06:24,560
He used to march with Martin
Luther King and with the activist.

95
00:06:24,561 --> 00:06:28,400
I was arrested with Martin Luther
King in Chicago. It's one of the,

96
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:29,950
yeah,

97
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:31,980
because pride moments of my life.
Um,

98
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:36,040
those of you who are considering
getting arrested for civil disobedience,

99
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:38,350
I want you to know,
I learned an important lesson.

100
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:41,500
Always get arrested with several
hundred of your best friends.

101
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:43,630
Cause if you're all
arrested at the same time,

102
00:06:43,631 --> 00:06:46,480
they put you in pretend jail
and you can bring guitars.

103
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:49,510
Uh,

104
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:54,130
the American Medical Association in those
days said that healthcare was a not a

105
00:06:54,131 --> 00:06:57,250
human right, but it was a privilege
for those who could afford it.

106
00:06:57,610 --> 00:07:01,120
We said that it was a human right.
As a consequence, we were radicals.

107
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:06,100
I came to San Francisco and
did my internship. This, um,

108
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:09,310
which I also had never
seen until I googled it.

109
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:13,480
This a cover of medical
world news showed up. Uh,

110
00:07:13,481 --> 00:07:17,710
and they made copies of it and put it
all over the hospital for my first day.

111
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:19,720
And uh,
they put a,

112
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:24,700
a bullseye around my face with a
hypodermic needle in my nose and it said

113
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:27,760
Presbyterian hospital welcomes
its new young radical.

114
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:31,000
Dr Radical in those days meant
that you were Bernie Sanders.

115
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:37,090
And then while I was in San Francisco,
all of you are too young to know this,

116
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:38,770
but in 1970,

117
00:07:38,771 --> 00:07:43,060
a group of native Americans took over
Alcatraz because the treaty of Laramie

118
00:07:43,061 --> 00:07:47,680
said that any surplus land that was
declared surplus that had been taken from

119
00:07:47,681 --> 00:07:51,430
the Indians would go back to the
Indians. Long Story Short, uh,

120
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:54,490
a woman named Lou tridel
wanted to deliver her baby,

121
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:59,050
an Indian liberated land, and there
was no water, there was no electricity,

122
00:07:59,051 --> 00:08:03,460
there was no medicine. And there was a
coast guard embargo around the island.

123
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,910
And a, the newspapers started
saying, is there no doctor?

124
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:10,210
Is there no doctor anywhere in
the area willing to go there?

125
00:08:10,211 --> 00:08:12,310
And I thought that was an
add. Larry, come to Alcatraz.

126
00:08:12,311 --> 00:08:17,140
So I lived on Alcatraz and I
delivered this baby named Wovoka.

127
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,110
If, you know, Indian history, we've,

128
00:08:19,111 --> 00:08:21,100
Oco was the founder of
the ghost dance religion.

129
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:26,610
And I could not prove to anybody that
I was on Alcatraz except I was able to

130
00:08:26,711 --> 00:08:30,910
Google everything I could find. And I
found that picture of me on Alcatraz.

131
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,640
Um,
when I came off the island,

132
00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:37,540
it seemed like every,

133
00:08:38,410 --> 00:08:39,120
yeah,

134
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,810
television camera in the world was
waiting for me when I came off on a coast

135
00:08:42,811 --> 00:08:46,730
guard boat and they put it there,
camera in my face and they said,

136
00:08:46,731 --> 00:08:50,670
what are the Indians want? And I had
never met a native American before.

137
00:08:50,671 --> 00:08:54,750
I went on the island and Detroit,
we don't have a lot. And uh,

138
00:08:54,751 --> 00:08:56,010
I have an answer,

139
00:08:56,220 --> 00:09:01,220
but Warner brothers saw me on television
and offered me a job playing a young

140
00:09:02,221 --> 00:09:07,221
doctor in a movie they were making
and also being the doctor for the rock

141
00:09:07,471 --> 00:09:11,090
concerts that the movie was about.
So it was the Jefferson airplane,

142
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,630
the grateful dead Jethro tool.

143
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:17,730
We ended up with a concert for pink
Floyd in Canterbury in England.

144
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:22,860
And I was the doc for that. Uh,
my first day on the Movie Caravan,

145
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:24,120
I met this guy

146
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:29,670
and I knew there was something different
about him because when he smiled,

147
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:31,920
all of his teeth were a rainbow.

148
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:36,240
He had got a dentist to put in a
[inaudible] violet, indigo, blue, red.

149
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:42,090
And when he said, and he had a, uh, a duck
bill had I made up a real duck's bill.

150
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:46,500
I knew there was something
different about wavy gravy and I,

151
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,680
I'm proud to tell you that over the last
40 years he's become my best friend.

152
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:55,530
Wavy of course is known for being the
master of ceremonies at Woodstock where

153
00:09:55,531 --> 00:09:59,880
he's the one who said what I have in
mind is breakfast in bed for 400,000.

154
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:04,860
He and his friends care van across Europe
and Asia providing relief in medical

155
00:10:04,861 --> 00:10:05,694
care.

156
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:10,170
Every country that we went through,

157
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:15,410
we use the medicine and the food and
everybody who was sick would come out who

158
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:21,540
be 70 people waiting to see Larry.
And there was a feeling

159
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,750
in the year. So I want to tell
you two things about this.

160
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:27,870
One is that we went to,
uh,

161
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:33,180
we lived in Afghanistan and
Pakistan and Iran, Iraq,

162
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:37,320
India,
Nepal with those buses.

163
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:41,490
And we would do medical care
camps every place I went.

164
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:43,560
And we had a little bit of medicine,
a little bit of food.

165
00:10:43,561 --> 00:10:46,980
Every place we went we going
to the smallest villages.

166
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:51,840
And if it was a Hindu village, there
would be a shrine to Lord Shiva. Or, um,

167
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:55,890
if it was a Buddhist village, there'd be
an image of Buddha was a Muslim village.

168
00:10:55,891 --> 00:10:59,760
There'd be a picture of, of
Mecca. And not every time,

169
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:05,180
but maybe three out of 10 times right
next to that image in the holiest part of

170
00:11:05,821 --> 00:11:08,640
the village, there would be
pictures of John F. Kennedy,

171
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:13,290
President United States in
Afghanistan and Iraq, Pakistan.

172
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:17,610
And it's going to be a long time before
there'll be a picture of an American

173
00:11:17,611 --> 00:11:22,320
president in a special place in
a village anywhere in the world.

174
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:26,580
And one of the things that I
realized is I wrote this book,

175
00:11:26,581 --> 00:11:30,720
I want to tell you a story that will
motivate you to believe that we can make

176
00:11:30,721 --> 00:11:31,710
the world again.

177
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:35,880
The kind of place where people all over
the world will feel about America as we

178
00:11:35,881 --> 00:11:40,500
felt then we were the good guys.
Let's not kid ourselves.

179
00:11:40,501 --> 00:11:41,910
A lot of it was aspirational,

180
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:45,540
but we need that aspiration
and we need to have it again.

181
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:49,050
And we've done it before
and we can do it again.

182
00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:52,860
And I'll tell you I was invited to,
this is my wife.

183
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:57,430
We've been married 47 years.
That was our psychedelic bus.

184
00:11:57,910 --> 00:12:01,330
Uh, I think I'm smoking some
illicit substance there.

185
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:07,890
I was honored and invited to the Pentagon
and given her word and asked to speak

186
00:12:08,111 --> 00:12:12,730
to the three and a half million soldiers
and sailors and Marines we have and to

187
00:12:12,731 --> 00:12:17,731
talk in the Pentagon auditorium to the
army brass to generals and admirals and

188
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:21,310
assistant secretaries of defense.

189
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:25,990
And I was talking about asymmetrical
warfare and unconventional threats to

190
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:29,500
national security,
cyber weapons and biological weapons,

191
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:32,590
but also climate change and
pandemics and things like that.

192
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:37,980
And before I started my talk and the
auditorium was filled with people who I

193
00:12:38,321 --> 00:12:42,000
wouldn't normally have thought of that
I'd be hanging out with when I looked

194
00:12:42,001 --> 00:12:45,430
like this.
And as I showed this picture first,

195
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:51,580
and I said, I think before I talked to
you about threats to national security,

196
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:56,110
you ought to see this picture. Now,
there's only two possibilities.

197
00:12:56,710 --> 00:13:00,370
Either you know about this.
Well, you don't know about this.

198
00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:02,860
If you know about this,

199
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:08,230
good on you that you still invited me.
If you don't know about this,

200
00:13:08,231 --> 00:13:13,000
we got big problems because
you're the Pentagon. Well,

201
00:13:13,001 --> 00:13:17,800
I went from, uh, being a hippie. I had
been a radical and I became a hippie.

202
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:22,330
Then I went to live in a monastery and
this is the Ashram that I lived in.

203
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:26,770
It's Kenchi, it's at the corner
of India and Nepal and China.

204
00:13:26,771 --> 00:13:30,160
And this is my guru, neem Karoli Baba.
And he's reading a book about him.

205
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,830
And I just had a chance,
am I allowed to say,

206
00:13:32,831 --> 00:13:36,820
I just had a chance to see
virtual reality of the Taj Mahal.

207
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:39,700
And this is real reality of the Taj Mahal.

208
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:44,230
This is my wife and I in 1973
in front of the Taj Mahal.

209
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,240
And you know, there were no barriers
then. We actually slept inside the tomb.

210
00:13:49,241 --> 00:13:51,370
We didn't know it was a tomb.
We were idiots.

211
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:56,830
And this is a picture of
my guru and myself, uh,

212
00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:00,130
after I'd been living in
that Ashram for three years,

213
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:01,810
you asked me to tell that story.

214
00:14:01,811 --> 00:14:05,740
I'll tell you the story of what's
happening here. He said to me,

215
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:11,470
uh, everybody who comes here learns
Hinduism and Buddhism and Jainism.

216
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:16,330
We learn Islam. We learned to read
the Old Testament, the new testament,

217
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:21,940
and then we're taught to meditate and
we're taught to do service. And he said,

218
00:14:21,941 --> 00:14:25,570
Larry, he's to call me doctor
America. He said, Doctor America,

219
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,570
I want you to do that too,
but I want you to do something else.

220
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:31,870
How much money do you have?
And I said, wait a minute.

221
00:14:32,770 --> 00:14:36,430
I was little confused. He's an
in this all in Hindi. He said,

222
00:14:36,431 --> 00:14:40,900
how much money do you have?
I said, I have $500 he said,

223
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:45,610
not here. You're lying. How much money
do you have back in America? I said,

224
00:14:45,611 --> 00:14:49,510
well I have a $500 back in America too.

225
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:54,740
And he said, $5 here. $500
there. That's all you have.

226
00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:58,310
You are no doctor,
which is what my mother said to me.

227
00:15:00,450 --> 00:15:02,720
Yeah I have is 500 bucks.
You no doctor.

228
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:08,600
But he said all of this in Hindi and he
said, you are no doctor, Doctor America,

229
00:15:08,601 --> 00:15:12,360
you are no doctor. You are new doc, Toto,
Dr Nicky. And come to his afternoon,

230
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:16,940
kept saying it over again.
Then he switched to English and he said,

231
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:19,610
you are no doctor.
You are no doctor,

232
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:23,210
you n Oh doctor,

233
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:26,180
United Nations organization.

234
00:15:26,181 --> 00:15:29,690
Dr America is going to
become United Nations doctor.

235
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:34,580
You're going to go to villages,
you're going to give vaccinations.

236
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,450
There's a war against this
disease called smallpox.

237
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:42,320
It's going to be eradicated on Mullen,
pulled out by the roots.

238
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:47,330
This is God's gift to
humanity. Get outta here. Go.

239
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,810
And he sent me down to the
World Health Organization,

240
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:54,920
which was a bus to drive a car on a train,

241
00:15:55,310 --> 00:15:59,540
maybe 17 hours away.
And I walked in there and they said,

242
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:00,980
what are you doing here?
I looked like,

243
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:05,950
I mean I had a dress on and I had a beard
down to the middle of my back and said,

244
00:16:05,951 --> 00:16:06,920
what are you doing here? I said, well,

245
00:16:06,921 --> 00:16:11,300
my guru who lives in the Himalayas says
that I'm supposed to come work for the

246
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:14,040
United Nations because God's
gift to humanity and said,

247
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,410
we're going to eradicate smallpox.

248
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:18,380
And I was there for about
30 seconds the first time,

249
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:22,910
and I went back up to the Ashram and he
said, did you get your job? And I said,

250
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:26,990
you know, go back down. And
that went on 10, 15 times.

251
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,060
And each time I got a little smarter,

252
00:16:29,061 --> 00:16:33,410
I trim my hair a little bit and cut
my beard a bit and put on a jacket.

253
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:38,840
And um, after a while I understood
there was no smallpox program.

254
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:40,131
Mrs Gandhi,

255
00:16:40,131 --> 00:16:44,960
who was in the prime minister I think
correctly said that India had other

256
00:16:44,961 --> 00:16:49,440
problems, poverty and diarrheal
deaths and pneumonia. Um,

257
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:53,630
and I felt kind of silly every
time coming in and being rebuffed,

258
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:58,700
uh, and getting back to the Ashram and
my group is saying, this is your destiny,

259
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:02,870
and it, nothing was feeling right to
me. And I walked in one day, he said,

260
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:05,900
right now, go immediately.
So I took a train,

261
00:17:05,901 --> 00:17:10,901
I went in there and walked in and for the
first time in six months of going back

262
00:17:11,661 --> 00:17:16,010
and forth what I walked into,
it was another American and he said,

263
00:17:16,011 --> 00:17:20,360
who are you? And I said, hi, my name
is Larry Brilliant. I'm a doctor.

264
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:23,480
I live in the Himalaya is my guru.
Said this,

265
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:25,730
I'm supposed to work for
the smallpox program.

266
00:17:25,850 --> 00:17:29,000
God is going to help eradicate
smallpox. Who are you? He said, Oh,

267
00:17:29,001 --> 00:17:31,010
I'm the head of the smallpox
program from Geneva.

268
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:36,590
I'm just here trying to talk Mrs Gandhi
into letting us have a smallpox program.

269
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:38,870
We don't have one yet.
Um,

270
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:42,440
but should I interview
you just in case we do.

271
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:48,200
And that was da Henderson who died about
four weeks ago and I'm going to go to

272
00:17:48,201 --> 00:17:49,034
his funeral in two.

273
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:55,520
He was the head of the global program and
after I had worked in that program for

274
00:17:55,591 --> 00:18:00,180
10 years and I was running
the program in New Delhi, uh,

275
00:18:00,181 --> 00:18:05,181
he sent me to back to close
down the program after we
eradicated smallpox and to

276
00:18:05,941 --> 00:18:08,040
put all the records
together and to microfilm.

277
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:12,270
And when I found his interview
that he did with me, and he said,

278
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:16,150
I have today interviewed a young man.
He's American. His name is Larry,

279
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:21,210
says he's a doctor. It does not look
like one. He appears to have gone native.

280
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:24,480
And I treasure that.

281
00:18:24,481 --> 00:18:27,600
In this book is the first book
I've ever written about smallpox.

282
00:18:27,601 --> 00:18:31,950
The Da Henderson did not edit
every page, every word. So, okay.

283
00:18:31,951 --> 00:18:36,540
So here's my transformation from
being a radical to being a Hippie,

284
00:18:36,541 --> 00:18:40,410
to being a mystic,
to being a UN officer.

285
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:43,710
And that was my boss,
Nicole grass.

286
00:18:43,711 --> 00:18:48,711
Say a French doctor who she
won the legion of honor.

287
00:18:48,871 --> 00:18:50,490
In fact,
all the people that I work with,

288
00:18:50,491 --> 00:18:54,790
Da Henderson and bill figgy won the
presidential medal of freedom. He Sour.

289
00:18:54,810 --> 00:18:58,560
Rita won the Japan Prize, mid
Sharma Mooney, Interdev Sharma,

290
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:01,620
one pub missionary in Putnam,
booboo, Sean for the Indians here.

291
00:19:01,621 --> 00:19:02,550
You know what that means?

292
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:07,890
And we went door to door trying to find
every case of smallpox in the world at

293
00:19:07,891 --> 00:19:12,570
the same time and put a ring of immunity
around it because that was the only way

294
00:19:12,571 --> 00:19:15,510
that you could stop smallpox,
which had so many different names.

295
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:19,680
You couldn't actually say the name.
Uh, how many of you speak Bengali?

296
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:25,440
Chonteau is spring sickness and
she Kalama cooling mother. Um,

297
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:30,280
and so we showed that little card and
we found cases of smallpox and other,

298
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:32,250
this is the part I apologize for.

299
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:37,320
I'm going to show you three pictures of
smallpox and I've chosen ones that are

300
00:19:37,321 --> 00:19:38,880
not particularly terrifying,

301
00:19:38,881 --> 00:19:42,870
but they will still be terrifying because
it was the worst disease in the world.

302
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:45,660
Uh,
this is a young boy in south India.

303
00:19:47,130 --> 00:19:51,600
This woman died of hemorrhagic smallpox,
particularly cruel form of smallpox,

304
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,250
a hundred percent fatal,

305
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:57,270
ordinary smallpox was only one third fail.

306
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:03,080
And here's the computation that over
200 million deaths in this last century,

307
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:07,650
more than all the
genocides and world wars.

308
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:12,330
And here's really an important slide. This
is my favorite slide in public health.

309
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:17,070
It's all the kings and Queens and
emperors who died of smallpox.

310
00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:20,520
And it's not my favorite slide because I
particularly want to kill off kings and

311
00:20:20,521 --> 00:20:21,354
Queens,

312
00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:25,290
but it applies to the heads of all the
great technology companies and all the

313
00:20:25,291 --> 00:20:30,000
CEOs and startups in the meadow cheese
in this world we live in now and in

314
00:20:30,001 --> 00:20:35,001
silicon valley because it doesn't help
you to be in the 1% or the one quarter of

315
00:20:36,091 --> 00:20:41,091
1% of the one one 1% of 1% if there's
a virus that has no antiviral and no

316
00:20:41,431 --> 00:20:42,000
vaccine,

317
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,990
you will die and these are the most
powerful people in the world and they died

318
00:20:45,991 --> 00:20:46,824
of smallpox.

319
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:51,370
It's just a reminder that we're all
in it together and I'm not going to go

320
00:20:51,371 --> 00:20:54,820
through all the rest of the history
of smallpox with you this time.

321
00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:57,880
It's in the book and they were
had a chance to say that before,

322
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:02,320
but I will show you a picture of
the fellow, this wonderful man,

323
00:21:02,321 --> 00:21:07,321
Bill faggy who created the strategy that
we used and I am I tell you about bill

324
00:21:07,631 --> 00:21:09,550
because his father was
a Lutheran minister.

325
00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:13,960
His grandfather was a Lutheran minister
and I've used this slide set to talk

326
00:21:13,961 --> 00:21:18,961
about compassion and bill is the most
compassionate person I've ever met.

327
00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:21,730
He was the head of CDC,
the head of the Carter Center.

328
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:25,630
He's rumored to have whispered
into Bill Gates his ear.

329
00:21:25,631 --> 00:21:29,860
It might be a good idea to start a
foundation. He's an amazing person.

330
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:35,760
He says the countries should be judged
not by the GDP or by their wealth,

331
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:41,110
but how they treat people who
don't look like the leaders

332
00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:45,850
who don't have the same color,
don't speak the same language,

333
00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:49,750
don't have the same religion,
aren't living in the same town.

334
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:55,950
We should judge civilizations
and histories by the
compassion they show to those

335
00:21:56,501 --> 00:22:01,501
who are most different than the rulers
and and not just different now but far

336
00:22:02,891 --> 00:22:04,220
away do.

337
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:09,300
Can we look at a child in Aleppo who has
been bombed and is dying in Syria and

338
00:22:09,851 --> 00:22:14,851
have as much compassion for that child
as we would for our neighbor and not just

339
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:17,590
today.
Can we think about the children,

340
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:20,680
the grandchildren and the
great grandchildren will be
affected by climate change,

341
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:25,930
by an invisible, odorless, tasteless
gas. It's going to destroy their world.

342
00:22:25,931 --> 00:22:28,960
Do we have compassion going
forward and backwards?

343
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:33,760
Do we have compassion for our ancestors
and our traditions? He's a great man.

344
00:22:33,761 --> 00:22:38,710
Bill fakey and I think that I will
stop there and thank you very much.

345
00:22:38,711 --> 00:22:42,070
And then Peter and I are gonna talk about,
so thank you very much.

346
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:47,490
[inaudible]

347
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:50,970
I'm going to take my privilege to ask a
couple of questions then we'll turn it

348
00:22:50,971 --> 00:22:54,000
over to the audience.
So, uh, one is, you know,

349
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:59,240
you went door to door giving vaccinations
when you want it to communicate some

350
00:23:01,291 --> 00:23:05,960
place else. It could take days to set
up communication. Now that we have, uh,

351
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:07,950
more communication technology,

352
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:12,270
what could you do differently today
and what are the targets that we could

353
00:23:12,271 --> 00:23:13,760
eradicate or,
or,

354
00:23:15,170 --> 00:23:16,370
yeah,
I think it's a great question.

355
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:22,000
I'm often asked to compare the
eradication of polio with eradication of

356
00:23:22,010 --> 00:23:26,840
smallpox. Um, because of course
we didn't even have telegrams.

357
00:23:26,841 --> 00:23:31,100
We had telex machines and
no personal computers,

358
00:23:31,130 --> 00:23:34,670
no computers, no cell phones, no phones.

359
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:38,330
If you wanted to make a long distance
call from Calcutta to New Delhi,

360
00:23:38,510 --> 00:23:41,360
you had to book it two days in advance.

361
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:45,320
And if you wanted to call
from Delhi to Geneva,

362
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:48,050
you had to send a telex. I mean, um,

363
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:51,920
so we didn't have that with
him photocopying machines. Um,

364
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:57,580
but we had an incredible will to eradicate
and smallpox because on its face it's

365
00:24:00,981 --> 00:24:01,970
so horrible.

366
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:06,890
It helps to generate a will to conquer it.

367
00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:08,750
Polio,
on the other hand,

368
00:24:10,010 --> 00:24:14,510
you can't see it unless
somebody is actually paralyzed.

369
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:17,810
You don't know it. It's it, it's
in the feces. And then the water,

370
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:22,130
only one out of a thousand kids who
get polio actually have any physical

371
00:24:22,131 --> 00:24:27,050
symptoms. So it's hard to develop
that will. So the polio campaign,

372
00:24:27,051 --> 00:24:28,640
which is so close to eradicating,

373
00:24:28,641 --> 00:24:33,620
they've only been 17 cases of polio in
Pakistan, seven cases in Afghanistan,

374
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:38,270
two or three in Nigeria all year. I
mean, we got really that close. Uh,

375
00:24:38,271 --> 00:24:41,960
they've had all the technology and
they've really done, and I'm the genomics,

376
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:46,990
some incredible advances in genomic
technology and being able to do all the

377
00:24:47,841 --> 00:24:51,380
communications. If we had
had that in smallpox, um,

378
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:55,430
we probably could have cut the
time that it took us to eradicate.

379
00:24:55,431 --> 00:25:00,431
And half a smallpox eradication
cost $150 million in 1960 $7,

380
00:25:02,810 --> 00:25:04,580
you know,
call it a billion.

381
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:08,330
We reap those benefits
every week in the world,

382
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:11,480
not just from the lack of
suffering and the lack of disease,

383
00:25:11,481 --> 00:25:14,600
but even in the little yellow cards
we used to have to carry going across

384
00:25:14,610 --> 00:25:19,280
airports. I think polio eradication
is already cost about $10 billion.

385
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:24,650
So having the technology
alone is not enough.

386
00:25:25,170 --> 00:25:28,010
I'll just say one more thing
about medical technology.

387
00:25:28,850 --> 00:25:33,620
We had a vaccine against smallpox for
a hundred years before we were able to

388
00:25:33,621 --> 00:25:38,570
eradicate smallpox. We've had a
vaccine against polio for 60 years.

389
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:43,520
It takes people more than technology.
I'm here at Google.

390
00:25:43,521 --> 00:25:48,110
This may be a surprise.
It takes people more than technology.

391
00:25:48,470 --> 00:25:51,770
The technological advances in medicine,

392
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:54,830
whether an antiviral or
antibiotic or a vaccine,

393
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:59,780
they are the condition precedent that
allows you to think about conquering your

394
00:25:59,781 --> 00:26:04,280
disease. But in many ways,
they're just the beginning. Okay.

395
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:07,050
And then one more question. So, uh,

396
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:10,800
I was an office mate with the Mang
for awhile and then in the early days,

397
00:26:10,801 --> 00:26:13,860
and we work together and through
him and others, you know,

398
00:26:13,861 --> 00:26:18,861
I've worked on my mindfulness
and compassion and serenity
and I keep working at

399
00:26:19,321 --> 00:26:21,540
it and think I'm making some progress,

400
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:27,020
but I've never ever achieved this kind
of spiritual enlightenment that you talk

401
00:26:28,441 --> 00:26:31,650
about. And I think you were maybe
a little bit skeptical at first,

402
00:26:31,770 --> 00:26:36,040
but you got there. So what am I
missing? Is it the girl is the drugs?

403
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:43,560
So is there anybody in this room
that has not had that question?

404
00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:50,120
I don't mean about the
drugs. Um, you know,

405
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:54,050
you said it earlier, you said that I
got lucky. I feel that way. I mean, I,

406
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:57,270
I met a teacher who was still alive.

407
00:26:57,570 --> 00:27:01,660
We only had three years before he
died, but we had, we had that. Um,

408
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:06,650
and when I sat in front of him, I
remember the first time, I mean,

409
00:27:06,651 --> 00:27:10,810
I was really skeptical. I
mean, uh, a kid from a, uh,

410
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:15,370
Jewish tradition in Detroit,
Michigan, going into an Ashram,

411
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:18,720
filled with idols, touching
the feet of the guru. I mean,

412
00:27:18,721 --> 00:27:21,930
these are all things I was trained.
That's the last thing you ever do.

413
00:27:21,931 --> 00:27:26,550
I was waiting for a golden calf to come
out and march across the Cecil Beaton

414
00:27:26,550 --> 00:27:30,870
Mil screen, you know, um, I
thought it was really weird.

415
00:27:31,290 --> 00:27:35,040
And um, and then, um, one day, uh,

416
00:27:35,041 --> 00:27:40,041
he held my hand for a second and I could
sense that he felt nothing but total

417
00:27:43,411 --> 00:27:47,520
love, not just for me, but
for everybody in the world.

418
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:52,630
And then,
then this thing happened where my,

419
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:55,630
my rational mind,
I'm a scientist,

420
00:27:56,350 --> 00:27:59,980
maybe I just play one on television,
but I pretend to be a scientist.

421
00:28:00,670 --> 00:28:04,960
My rational mind couldn't figure
out what was happening to me.

422
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:09,460
I could accept that he loved everybody
in the world because that's his job.

423
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,073
He's a guru.

424
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:15,520
What I didn't understand is that in that
moment I loved everybody in the world

425
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:21,180
and I had never felt like that before.
I mean,

426
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:26,400
I gave a talk the other
day and I mentioned that my
friend Ron doss has a um,

427
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:32,270
like a religious table on it and he put
a picture of Trump because he's trying

428
00:28:33,361 --> 00:28:36,240
to show love to somebody who
otherwise he would not feel love for.

429
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:43,260
And I think that's the thing is that
when you have that spiritual experience,

430
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:46,500
we are really all one. And, and,

431
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:48,960
and it's not just that we're 99.4,

432
00:28:48,961 --> 00:28:51,990
4% the same genetic material.

433
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:54,690
It's that we really are all one.

434
00:28:54,691 --> 00:28:59,691
We cannot forget that diversity is
not something that is thrust upon us.

435
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:06,300
It is the biggest opportunity that's
given to us because each one of us has a

436
00:29:06,301 --> 00:29:11,070
little bit of the secret.
It's part of being a different person,

437
00:29:11,071 --> 00:29:13,590
a different culture, a different
community, a different language.

438
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:16,860
We all have a little bit of that secret,

439
00:29:16,861 --> 00:29:21,861
that little Harry Potter secret
map in us and that experience,

440
00:29:23,610 --> 00:29:28,610
you come by by luck as I
did by years of meditation,

441
00:29:31,650 --> 00:29:35,970
by childbirth, by knitting, by praying,

442
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:39,870
by being in the monastery,

443
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:42,010
by working in the street with kids,

444
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:44,740
by feeling compassionate
towards your grandparents.

445
00:29:46,150 --> 00:29:50,890
I have met people who've had that
experience in every way imaginable.

446
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:55,270
There's no one way that is
the same for each of us.

447
00:29:55,271 --> 00:29:59,920
We've all got our own little map that's
been given to us, our own religion,

448
00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:04,410
whatever it is, is her
own, as they say in India,

449
00:30:04,430 --> 00:30:07,480
at her own Dharma.
Our own destiny is better for us,

450
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:11,740
however humble than somebody else's.

451
00:30:12,910 --> 00:30:17,290
And that, that's what I learned. I
learned to respect every religion.

452
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:20,530
I started studying all
religions that I could.

453
00:30:20,531 --> 00:30:23,440
I started making pilgrimages
to each religion. I,

454
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:27,040
I started trying to meet people
who were very different than me

455
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:31,240
and it all came out of that
one experience. So Peter,

456
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:36,280
everybody who knows you knows you're not
missing a damn thing. You, you haven't,

457
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:38,530
nothing has alluded to.

458
00:30:39,490 --> 00:30:43,000
And I think everybody who knows
you is privileged to know you.

459
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:49,000
Thank you doctor America.
Let's go to the audience questions.

460
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:53,530
Anybody? Thank you. Oh,
it's a question. Uh, Larry,

461
00:30:53,531 --> 00:30:58,531
what do you think America could do to get
to a place where other countries would

462
00:30:58,961 --> 00:31:00,730
feel that way about America again?

463
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:03,640
And why do they have JFK his
picture in the first place?

464
00:31:04,590 --> 00:31:09,450
Um, I think they had GFKs
picture because, um, you know,

465
00:31:10,050 --> 00:31:12,120
everybody and those little
villages either had a,

466
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:16,290
an uncle or a cousin who had gone to New
York or going to school in America or,

467
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:17,310
or wanted to,

468
00:31:18,270 --> 00:31:22,290
because a lot of the myths that America's
streets were covered with gold was

469
00:31:22,291 --> 00:31:23,124
part of it.

470
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:28,880
But it always felt like America after
the Second World War as a victorious,

471
00:31:30,150 --> 00:31:33,720
an occupying power was such a benevolent

472
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:37,100
occupying power.
We didn't take,

473
00:31:38,350 --> 00:31:42,900
we didn't take one acre of land
in Germany. I mean, we just, um,

474
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:45,640
it was our highest and our best moment,
I think,

475
00:31:46,690 --> 00:31:49,930
and this was not 20 years
after the Second World War,

476
00:31:49,990 --> 00:31:53,590
when that glow of how
well we had behaved as a

477
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:58,600
victor.
Um Huh.

478
00:31:58,790 --> 00:32:01,430
That's not to excuse a lot of
the things that happened in war,

479
00:32:02,390 --> 00:32:07,180
but people saw us as,
um, the sole superpower.

480
00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:12,140
I mean, we were beginning this cold war
with the Soviet Union, but we were the,

481
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:15,140
on our way to becoming
the world's policeman,

482
00:32:15,141 --> 00:32:19,340
but a good cop and the world wanted that.
I think we still want that.

483
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:24,350
I think we still want a good cup.
I want America to be powerful.

484
00:32:24,351 --> 00:32:26,900
I want our army and our
navy to be powerful,

485
00:32:27,170 --> 00:32:29,180
but only if we're going to be good cops.

486
00:32:29,510 --> 00:32:31,400
I don't want us to be
powerful from the bad cops.

487
00:32:31,430 --> 00:32:36,430
I want us to be good cops
and able to protect the

488
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:42,830
people who trying to do good things.
And why JFK,

489
00:32:42,831 --> 00:32:47,831
his picture was there was because he
represented that moment in America when it

490
00:32:49,491 --> 00:32:54,491
seemed that we were sort of like your
rich uncle who you can depend on in an

491
00:32:54,921 --> 00:32:55,730
emergency or they,

492
00:32:55,730 --> 00:33:00,730
she aspired to be able to depend on an
emergency and how we get back there.

493
00:33:02,061 --> 00:33:06,530
It's a long way. We've done a
lot of things. It's a long way.

494
00:33:07,190 --> 00:33:10,520
Um, I think we're still the best
country in the world personally,

495
00:33:11,330 --> 00:33:13,700
but we don't live up to my expectations.

496
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:18,440
I hope we don't live up to anybody's
expectations. We need, we need to,

497
00:33:18,770 --> 00:33:23,770
to change and try and get better
and stronger and more loving.

498
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:26,750
We, we need the kind of training
that Peter's talking about.

499
00:33:27,950 --> 00:33:31,790
I grew up in India and I can testify
that I've seen pictures of JFK and all

500
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:36,460
laces, usually with the flower of
Garlin dot between his eyebrows.

501
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:39,670
But my question was about the
picture behind you, President Obama.

502
00:33:40,150 --> 00:33:41,910
And it's no longer there,
but yeah,

503
00:33:42,730 --> 00:33:45,460
he's in his last hundred
days of his presidency.

504
00:33:45,461 --> 00:33:48,460
And I'm personally quite sad that
that era is coming to an end.

505
00:33:48,910 --> 00:33:52,150
But I was wondering how you would,
how the world looks upon his legacy.

506
00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:54,290
I think the Nobel prize
committee kind of jumped around,

507
00:33:54,590 --> 00:33:58,340
jumped the gun. Yeah. I think
I have one picture which has,

508
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:02,510
we have two people from Google
in this picture. And, uh,

509
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:07,310
President Obama and this crazy guy
over here, and this is the group of,

510
00:34:07,370 --> 00:34:10,790
uh,
Silicon Valley folks who,

511
00:34:11,390 --> 00:34:15,990
when Ebola happened in, um, in,

512
00:34:16,050 --> 00:34:17,360
in Africa,
in West Africa,

513
00:34:17,910 --> 00:34:22,910
we had a meeting of a Google and Facebook
and salesforce and Yahoo and apple and

514
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,310
every other technology
company. And we, uh,

515
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:29,780
I work at Skoll Global Threats Fund
where I'm the chairman and we convened a

516
00:34:29,781 --> 00:34:31,340
meeting,
uh,

517
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:36,400
and all the tech companies jumped in
to help President Obama to deliver

518
00:34:37,701 --> 00:34:41,870
America's best,
to stop the epidemic of Ebola.

519
00:34:42,410 --> 00:34:47,410
And then afterwards he brought us all to
the White House to thank us and this is

520
00:34:48,410 --> 00:34:52,430
leadership at its best. We all
jumped in. Paul Allen jumped in,

521
00:34:52,431 --> 00:34:57,050
Microsoft jumped in, it's not
just silicon valley. And we, uh,

522
00:34:57,080 --> 00:35:01,400
salesforce built a, uh, a
patient tracking system and, and,

523
00:35:01,410 --> 00:35:04,140
and Google gave money
in technology and uh,

524
00:35:04,610 --> 00:35:08,540
Larry Lucy page gave money and soccer
Burke gave me, if everybody did,

525
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:10,190
it was a great,

526
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,420
I don't have to take you back to the
Cold War were Russians and Americans and

527
00:35:14,421 --> 00:35:17,600
170 nations work together.
We can still do this stuff.

528
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:21,620
And we did it because
Obama called us to do it.

529
00:35:22,130 --> 00:35:25,430
We did it because that's
what we're supposed to do.

530
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:30,140
That's why we're doing what we're doing.
We're not here just to write code.

531
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:34,430
We're here because we think writing code
to help make the world a better place.

532
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:37,620
All of us, every one of us, we
may forget that from time to time,

533
00:35:38,370 --> 00:35:43,200
but here when children were dying and we
were seeing these horrific pictures of

534
00:35:43,201 --> 00:35:44,034
Ebola,

535
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:48,060
we were willing to jump in because we
had the leadership and the means to do it

536
00:35:48,330 --> 00:35:50,190
and we're going to be
asked to do that more.

537
00:35:50,850 --> 00:35:54,150
All of us and we're going
to jump in and do it again.

538
00:35:54,790 --> 00:35:56,150
My question was slightly different though.

539
00:35:56,151 --> 00:35:58,990
I was just wondering how do you think
the world would look upon him, you know,

540
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:01,960
10 years? Oh, I think his legacy
is going to grow and we're going to

541
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:04,180
back upon him as one of the
greatest presidents in history.

542
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:08,380
I think we're going to miss
not only his intellect,

543
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:14,020
but his demeanor. I think we
did it. I don't know this,

544
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:16,300
this video will probably be
received 10 years from now,

545
00:36:16,301 --> 00:36:17,560
so this will not make any sense,

546
00:36:17,830 --> 00:36:22,690
but how many of you heard Michelle
Obama's talk yesterday? I mean, hello?

547
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:24,671
Let's see.

548
00:36:24,671 --> 00:36:28,760
We brought the you just before you
got your advice to basically eradicate

549
00:36:28,761 --> 00:36:32,780
smallpox, brought them into the future
and you are talking to the younger you.

550
00:36:32,810 --> 00:36:35,840
What would you say to him in terms
of what he should be doing now?

551
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:36,860
Don't be an asshole.

552
00:36:38,910 --> 00:36:41,220
I mean, I was a jerk. Um,

553
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:45,130
well just before you mean just
before I was with marriage. You know,

554
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:49,110
by then I had a lot of my jerkiness
had been beaten out of me,

555
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:54,360
but certainly growing up, um, you know,

556
00:36:55,170 --> 00:37:00,170
I got to be sent to San Francisco in the
middle of the summer of love when I was

557
00:37:01,411 --> 00:37:04,800
working for the office of equal health
opportunity at a card that said civil

558
00:37:04,801 --> 00:37:09,470
rights specialist and I got tossed
into the summer of love. And a,

559
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:12,360
that's just not a fair thing to do to
a young kid from Detroit, Michigan.

560
00:37:12,361 --> 00:37:16,770
I had no tools to resist.
But before that,

561
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:21,750
um, I don't think I was a very nice
person. I don't think I was, uh,

562
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:25,230
I don't think they ever thought
about, you know, could I,

563
00:37:25,231 --> 00:37:27,540
if somebody was sick in front of me,
could I help them?

564
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:31,710
I didn't think about a
war 10,000 miles away or

565
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:35,160
I don't,
I don't think it's,

566
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:39,120
I don't think you should feel bad if
you're only thinking about yourself and

567
00:37:39,121 --> 00:37:42,240
your career.
That's the natural progression.

568
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:46,620
It takes something that,
um, the changes you to make.

569
00:37:46,621 --> 00:37:50,340
You start thinking about bigger things.
For me,

570
00:37:50,341 --> 00:37:54,750
it was my father and my grandfather
dying and I'm feeling sorry for myself,

571
00:37:54,990 --> 00:37:56,250
meeting Martin Luther King,

572
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:00,180
meeting wavy and all these
wonderful hippies in the 60s,

573
00:38:00,181 --> 00:38:02,610
which was such a great experience for me.

574
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:05,340
Meeting Neem Karoli Baba go faggy.

575
00:38:05,370 --> 00:38:10,370
I got to meet all these great giants who
really cared about the world and they

576
00:38:10,861 --> 00:38:14,970
gradually whittled away my ass wholeness.

577
00:38:16,770 --> 00:38:17,940
Well,
there's still a lot left.

578
00:38:20,970 --> 00:38:24,050
I'm really touched by the moment.
When you said you wouldn't,

579
00:38:24,051 --> 00:38:27,420
you touched their go to you.
You loved everyone.

580
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:31,650
You carry that with you still. Yeah,
pretty much. How do you keep it?

581
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:37,800
Um, I try to keep it safe. I
treasure it. I try to nurture it. Uh,

582
00:38:37,810 --> 00:38:42,160
I was at a meeting on Friday, a at
dream force. And the guy before me said,

583
00:38:42,610 --> 00:38:46,300
there's a native American,
uh, explanation for that.

584
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:49,840
And a young brave is
asking his grandfather,

585
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:55,150
how do I grow up to be wise and kind and
compassionate? And the grandfather says,

586
00:38:55,151 --> 00:38:58,330
well, son, there are two
wolves inside of you.

587
00:38:59,710 --> 00:39:01,570
And one of the wolves is an angry,

588
00:39:01,571 --> 00:39:05,620
howling beast who would rip
your throat out if he could,

589
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:08,770
who would take your money,
who would take your children?

590
00:39:09,730 --> 00:39:14,590
And the other one of these worlds loves
everybody in the world and is kind and

591
00:39:14,591 --> 00:39:19,090
would share everything. And they're
battling. And the young man said,

592
00:39:19,091 --> 00:39:21,370
grandfather,
which wolf will win?

593
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:26,590
And the grandfather said, well,
obviously the one that you feed,

594
00:39:28,090 --> 00:39:32,500
thank you for being with us today,
Peter and Larry, thank you so much.
