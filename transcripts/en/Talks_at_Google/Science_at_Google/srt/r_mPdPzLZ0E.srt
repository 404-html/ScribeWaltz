1
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:13,830
So thanks for having us back.
Um, it's nice to get reinvited.

2
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:16,500
It means we didn't do so poorly
the first time around. Um,

3
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:20,070
so my name is Louis Johnson and I am
most recently a rocky Vista University,

4
00:00:20,071 --> 00:00:22,380
which is a very small
medical school in Colorado,

5
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:25,200
but I until recently worked
at University of Washington.

6
00:00:25,201 --> 00:00:29,350
So I'm very happy to be back in the
region and joining some rain again. Um,

7
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:33,360
so today we're going to be talking about
our book and the first thing we want to

8
00:00:33,361 --> 00:00:37,310
talk about is why would we write a
book about worries? So this is, um,

9
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:40,110
a picture of my daughter,
um, a couple of years ago.

10
00:00:40,111 --> 00:00:42,940
She's much more advanced these days.
Um,

11
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:47,880
but I think for me,
I've always been kind of a worrier,

12
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:50,490
a worry wart. Anyway,
you want to phrase it.

13
00:00:50,491 --> 00:00:51,960
I've always been stressed
out about things,

14
00:00:51,961 --> 00:00:56,040
but this really accelerated as a
problem for me when I had kids.

15
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:58,710
Um, I don't know if anybody
else has had this experience,

16
00:00:58,711 --> 00:01:03,120
but I realized when I had kids that there
was like new categories of things that

17
00:01:03,121 --> 00:01:06,150
I had never even thought about that I
needed to worry about all of the sudden.

18
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:07,830
And as I would Google them,

19
00:01:07,831 --> 00:01:11,970
I would get a little stressed out because
you get a thousand hits for anything

20
00:01:11,971 --> 00:01:14,970
that you could potentially
be worried about. And um,

21
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:19,140
it started to really become kind of a
problem in my life that I was worrying

22
00:01:19,141 --> 00:01:20,100
about all of these things.

23
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:24,300
And my husband said to me one day as I
was freaking out about something trivial

24
00:01:24,301 --> 00:01:26,640
in retrospect, um, that, you know,

25
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:29,760
as a scientist you could probably figure
out what you need to worry about and

26
00:01:29,761 --> 00:01:33,180
what you don't. And I had this
realization that that was actually true.

27
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:35,080
And so I started,
um,

28
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:38,670
to kind of investigate in a logical way
the things that I thought were important

29
00:01:38,671 --> 00:01:42,360
to worry about and the things
that I didn't think were
important to worry about.

30
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:43,650
And as I was in this process,

31
00:01:43,651 --> 00:01:46,620
I realized lots of other people are
stressed out about lots of things as well.

32
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,470
Um, and that kind of kicked
off this process. And then, um,

33
00:01:49,471 --> 00:01:52,890
I worked with Eric Chudler at the time
and he graciously agreed to work on the

34
00:01:52,891 --> 00:01:55,740
project with me.
And that's kind of how we got started.

35
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:59,490
But one of the things that I've noticed
is that this is an extremely timely

36
00:01:59,491 --> 00:02:03,600
topic. Every time I tell someone, Hey,
I'm writing this book about worries,

37
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:07,950
they always respond with, did you write
a chapter on fill in the blank, right?

38
00:02:07,951 --> 00:02:09,990
Everybody has something that
they're really worried about.

39
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:14,820
So we're going to talk about some of the
things that we discuss in the book and

40
00:02:14,821 --> 00:02:18,480
then we're going to give some tips on
how people can investigate worries on

41
00:02:18,481 --> 00:02:23,370
their own. But first we want to talk
about what our methods were. Um,

42
00:02:23,371 --> 00:02:27,150
so Eric and I are both scientists and
I would venture to say kind of nerdy

43
00:02:27,151 --> 00:02:28,080
scientists at that.

44
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:32,730
And so we felt that we needed to have a
process and some defining principles as

45
00:02:32,731 --> 00:02:35,640
we embarked on this project.
So we thought about,

46
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:38,910
well what sorts of things should
you reasonably be worried about?

47
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:43,230
And we said there are really three
things that are important to consider.

48
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:47,130
The first is how likely is
something to happen to you. Um,

49
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:50,880
the second is how bad is it going to
be if it does in fact happen to you?

50
00:02:50,881 --> 00:02:54,660
And then finally, what can you do
to prevent it from happening to you?

51
00:02:54,661 --> 00:02:58,500
And we decided really that if
something is likely to happen to you,

52
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:02,050
if it's going to be bad,
and if you can do something about it,

53
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:04,670
then that sort of forms this magic,
um,

54
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:08,500
space of things that you should
worry about everything else.

55
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:10,810
If it's unlikely you don't
need to worry about it.

56
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,930
If it's not really going to be a big deal,
you don't need to worry about it.

57
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:15,610
And if there's nothing
you can do about it,

58
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,530
even if it is really
going to be a problem,

59
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:19,780
then you don't really need
to worry about that either.

60
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:22,090
Cause there's nothing that you
can really do to prevent it.

61
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:25,810
So it's kind of a waste of your time.
So we quantified,

62
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:29,260
quantified our worries in this way.

63
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:33,520
So for each of our problems
that we investigated,

64
00:03:33,521 --> 00:03:34,920
each of our topics that we investigated,

65
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:37,480
we created what's called what we call it,
the worry index.

66
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:42,670
So the index is really a
very loose quantification.
Okay? It's really based on,

67
00:03:42,671 --> 00:03:44,710
we investigated this,
we talked about it,

68
00:03:44,711 --> 00:03:48,400
and we scaled each of these
worries with respect to each other.

69
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:53,560
So it's not something to really
take religiously to the bank.

70
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:58,480
It's a good place to start. And so
we're going to talk about, um, how we,

71
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:02,020
how we feel about each of these topics
and hopefully we'll have a chance for you

72
00:04:02,021 --> 00:04:03,520
guys to participate as well.

73
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:09,890
So, as an example, uh, we're going
to talk about asteroid strikes.

74
00:04:09,891 --> 00:04:13,010
So that's one of the things that
some people worry about in fact,

75
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:17,210
millions years ago is the dinosaurs were
maybe worried about getting struck by

76
00:04:17,211 --> 00:04:21,280
an asteroid if they had a large enough
brain to worry about things. Uh,

77
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,180
but some people do worry about,
uh,

78
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:25,880
maybe all life on earth
will be destroyed again.

79
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:29,990
And so I'm going to give this in this
example about the criteria that we use and

80
00:04:29,991 --> 00:04:32,840
then we're going to give you
some examples to do on your own.

81
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:36,890
So for an asteroid strike,
um,

82
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:42,100
the likelihood of getting struck
by a large asteroid is minuscule.

83
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:45,860
So there are a couple of centuries systems
here in the United States and also in

84
00:04:45,861 --> 00:04:50,861
Europe that are scanning the skies for
large objects on their way to earth.

85
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:56,770
And it's estimated that the
next significant one within
the next hundred years

86
00:04:57,020 --> 00:05:02,020
has almost a 99.9% chance
that it will miss earth.

87
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:08,350
So the likelihood of a large asteroid
hitting the earth is almost nil.

88
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:12,770
Okay? So because it's unlikely
nothing to worry about,

89
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:15,500
so you should be happy about that.
Very unlikely.

90
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:18,290
Can you do anything to prevent it?

91
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,740
So if there was an asteroid
coming to earth goes,

92
00:05:20,741 --> 00:05:25,730
there's some way that you can avert this
disaster. So how many of you have seen,

93
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,890
uh, what is it, uh, uh,

94
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:32,510
Armageddon with Ben Affleck
and Bruce Willis? Yeah,

95
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:37,070
most of you have seen that
one, right? Would that work?
No, it's not going to work.

96
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:40,310
If you put a nuclear bomb on an asteroid,
you just,

97
00:05:40,311 --> 00:05:43,070
instead of one asteroid
coming down to earth,

98
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:47,570
you're going to get maybe a 101
and it will still be a big problem.

99
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:53,000
We do not have any technology at
this time to prevent an asteroid.

100
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:57,080
If it was coming toward us,
some technologies that are being thought,

101
00:05:57,230 --> 00:06:01,310
well maybe if you can break it
up into tiny, tiny little pieces,

102
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,390
maybe that would work.

103
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:06,860
Because our atmosphere is being
bombarded by asteroids all the time.

104
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:09,980
But they're small enough,
they burn up in the atmosphere.

105
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:12,560
It doesn't cause a problem.
Uh,

106
00:06:12,561 --> 00:06:16,520
other technologies might be descend
something up and rather than a break it

107
00:06:16,521 --> 00:06:19,820
apart, just nudge it a
little bit off course, right?

108
00:06:19,821 --> 00:06:22,580
Because if you catch it soon
enough because the earth is moving,

109
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:26,180
all you have to do is change their
trajectory a little bit and the earth will

110
00:06:26,181 --> 00:06:28,810
move out of the way. Right?
So they asked or the,

111
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:33,910
so the asteroid won't hit
another technology would
be to put up a large object

112
00:06:33,951 --> 00:06:38,951
and gravitation only pull the asteroid
away again to divert it off course.

113
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:43,550
And that would also cause him
to miss. Can we do that now? No.

114
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:48,380
So we can't do anything to prevent it.
So nothing to worry about.

115
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:53,240
Now if it did happen though,
sorry if it does happen,

116
00:06:53,241 --> 00:06:55,190
just like it happened
millions of years ago,

117
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:59,900
it would wipe out a lot of life on earth
and cute, including all human life.

118
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:04,140
All right, so the consequences devastated,
right? If something like that happen,

119
00:07:04,141 --> 00:07:08,330
all human life would probably be
destroyed. All right? So unfortunately,

120
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:10,820
so when you add all these up together,

121
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:14,660
this is where we would place
it on that lower left side.

122
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:18,380
It's unlikely to happen.
There's nothing you can do about it.

123
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:21,830
I'll do the consequences would be bad.
But because of those two criteria,

124
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:26,870
getting struck by an asteroid is
nothing for you to worry about. Okay?

125
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:31,060
So those are the methods we use.
We looked at the data of the likelihood,

126
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:34,670
the consequence,
and can you do anything to prevent it?

127
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:40,070
Uh, so now, uh, it's a sort of
audience participation time.

128
00:07:40,071 --> 00:07:44,090
So all of you should have a
piece of paper with a little,

129
00:07:44,091 --> 00:07:48,560
a graph on it, a little plot. And a,

130
00:07:48,561 --> 00:07:53,561
your job is to assign a little dot
and the size of the.is going to be the

131
00:07:55,161 --> 00:07:59,220
consequence. And you should be
plotting it, uh, on the to scale.

132
00:07:59,221 --> 00:08:01,250
So at least it's going to
introduce the first one.

133
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:02,643
Hmm.

134
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:07,610
Okay. So the first thing we're
going to talk about is mercury.

135
00:08:07,611 --> 00:08:11,030
So everybody play along. It's after lunch.
So everybody wake up. Participation is,

136
00:08:11,031 --> 00:08:12,430
is key.
Um,

137
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:17,620
I want you on your plot to make a bubble
sort of relative to the size that you

138
00:08:18,381 --> 00:08:22,220
think it should be. And then
also too, uh, oh yeah, exactly.

139
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:23,660
Eric put up this nice plot.

140
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:27,770
So put it in at the quadrant that you
think it belongs in and then give it a

141
00:08:27,771 --> 00:08:30,770
size relative to the magnitude of
the problem that you think it is.

142
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,370
I'll give you just a minute to do
that and then, um, we'll continue.

143
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:37,390
Everybody has to play commit.

144
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:46,290
Okay. So raise your hand if you think that
it belongs in this quadrant down here.

145
00:08:46,291 --> 00:08:48,180
Unlikely.
And you can't do anything to stop it.

146
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:50,943
Excellent.

147
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:55,470
How about unlikely? And you can do
something about it. Yes. Excellent.

148
00:08:55,471 --> 00:08:58,320
Some people think so likely to happen,
but you can't do anything about it.

149
00:08:58,321 --> 00:09:02,820
This is sort of the fatalistic category
down here. A few. And how about up here?

150
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:04,740
Likely to happen. You need,
you can do something about it.

151
00:09:04,741 --> 00:09:08,790
Therefore you should worry. Okay. Some
of you aren't playing, but that's fine.

152
00:09:08,791 --> 00:09:12,420
You'll get into it. So
here's where we put it. Okay.

153
00:09:12,421 --> 00:09:15,630
So we actually put it up here in the
word category and it gets a relatively

154
00:09:15,631 --> 00:09:19,950
large dot. So why is that?
I kind of primed you.

155
00:09:19,951 --> 00:09:22,080
I'm thinking about this by
giving you a picture of a fish.

156
00:09:22,081 --> 00:09:26,730
So many people are thinking about methyl
mercury, which is part of our diet,

157
00:09:26,731 --> 00:09:29,670
and we worry about it in that sense.
And that is a problem.

158
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:32,760
But there's also another form of mercury
that you might encounter and that would

159
00:09:32,761 --> 00:09:36,600
be elemental mercury. So how many people
have actually seen mercury in real life?

160
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:39,540
Yeah, so it's very cool, right?

161
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:42,720
My mom tells me stories about when
she was a kid in science class,

162
00:09:42,721 --> 00:09:45,960
they would actually give her a blob
of mercury to roll around in her hand.

163
00:09:45,961 --> 00:09:49,680
And it was, is so exciting because
it's silvery and it's neat, right?

164
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:53,490
Everybody thinks it's neat and people
have thought that it's neat for thousands

165
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:56,820
of years actually. So historically
it's been used for medicinal purposes.

166
00:09:56,821 --> 00:10:00,090
It used to be a very common treatment
for syphilis for example. Um,

167
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:03,840
it's been used for sort of magical or
ritualistic purposes and it still is,

168
00:10:03,841 --> 00:10:08,400
it's used in mining because
it forms amalgams with both
gold and silver and it's

169
00:10:08,401 --> 00:10:11,190
used in fillings, right? Does
anybody have silver fillings?

170
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:14,280
You probably all are gold fillings also.

171
00:10:14,281 --> 00:10:18,660
You also have some mercury in there
because it forms an amalgam. Um,

172
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:21,360
so the problem with mercury that
in addition to being very cool,

173
00:10:21,361 --> 00:10:23,860
it's obviously also very toxic, right? Um,

174
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:26,460
and mercury is most toxic,

175
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:30,450
not when you put it on your skin or even
when you eat it, but when you inhale it.

176
00:10:30,451 --> 00:10:33,180
So elemental mercury is most
dangerous when you inhale it.

177
00:10:33,181 --> 00:10:36,990
And which is strange because you don't
think about a metal is being particularly

178
00:10:36,991 --> 00:10:40,780
vaporous, but mercury is a
strange metal, right? And so, um,

179
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:45,420
it's most easily absorbed into your body
if you inhale it and then it crosses

180
00:10:45,421 --> 00:10:47,370
into your blood and then
it crosses into your brain.

181
00:10:47,371 --> 00:10:50,310
And there are a number of negative
side effects associated with that.

182
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:55,440
So elemental mercury is very much to be
avoided and we don't usually encounter

183
00:10:55,441 --> 00:10:58,680
it and commercial products anymore
that used to be in thermometers,

184
00:10:58,681 --> 00:11:01,500
but they've been highly phased out.
Um,

185
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:05,520
and you used to find it in science
classes and fishing lures and all kinds of

186
00:11:05,521 --> 00:11:06,270
places.

187
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:09,150
The problem is that even though we don't
manufacture those products anymore,

188
00:11:09,151 --> 00:11:10,120
even though we don't describe,

189
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:13,530
distribute it to science classes for kids
to play with in the palm of their hand,

190
00:11:13,531 --> 00:11:16,210
it's still exists in a legacy form.
Um,

191
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:19,500
and once it is distributed
in the environment,

192
00:11:19,501 --> 00:11:23,790
once you break a thermometer,
once you spill mercury, it's very,

193
00:11:23,791 --> 00:11:27,570
very difficult and expensive to
clean it up. You can't sweep it up.

194
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:28,920
You can't vacuum it up.

195
00:11:28,921 --> 00:11:31,410
You can't just dump it down
the drain because it persists.

196
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:35,100
And there have been examples of children
finding it in their science classrooms

197
00:11:35,101 --> 00:11:37,880
and taking it home and playing with
it and they have to take their houses

198
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:41,880
literally down to the studs in order
to decontaminate the house. Right.

199
00:11:41,881 --> 00:11:46,200
There has been an example of somebody
who broke a mercury thermometer 20 years

200
00:11:46,201 --> 00:11:50,190
prior in their home and they were still
recording measurable levels of Mercury

201
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:53,700
Vapor in the, in the, in the
room and the bathroom. Um,

202
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:58,120
so that can obviously be very problematic.
Methyl Mercury,

203
00:11:58,570 --> 00:12:02,980
which we're familiar with in the term
in terms of fish, um, is also a problem,

204
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:05,770
but it's hard to say how
big of a problem it is.

205
00:12:05,771 --> 00:12:10,771
And there's lots of confounders so
clearly having too much methyl mercury is

206
00:12:11,441 --> 00:12:16,040
toxic and we know that because
of an unfortunate incident
in Minamata Japan, um,

207
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:20,380
a number of years ago.
Um, but it's sort of the,

208
00:12:20,381 --> 00:12:23,800
in between levels are harder to quantify
because there are so many individual

209
00:12:23,801 --> 00:12:26,320
differences and because consuming fish,

210
00:12:26,321 --> 00:12:30,940
which is sort of the largest source of
methyl mercury is also really good for

211
00:12:30,941 --> 00:12:31,990
you.
In lots of other ways.

212
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:35,770
So it's kind of this strange balance
between fish is really good for you and

213
00:12:35,771 --> 00:12:36,940
your cognitive development,

214
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,760
but mercury is really bad for you
and your cognitive development.

215
00:12:39,761 --> 00:12:43,960
So how do we find the,
the happy medium between those two things?

216
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:47,380
And I think it's fair to say that
scientists are still arguing about that,

217
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:52,600
but um, one thing we can say is that fish
that are higher up on the food chain,

218
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:54,880
which usually means the big ones,
right?

219
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:58,750
That eat the littler ones are going to
have more concentration of methyl mercury.

220
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:03,370
Then ones that are lower on the food
chain, which means if you eat sardines,

221
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:07,210
you're going to get less mercury than
if you're eating shark or swordfish,

222
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:11,650
for example. So most experts recommend
now that you should try and eat fish,

223
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:12,491
but you should eat fish.

224
00:13:12,491 --> 00:13:16,090
They're lower on the food chain and fish
that are higher in omega fatty acids.

225
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:19,823
Okay,

226
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:22,540
so this one gets us a frowny face.
Yeah.

227
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:25,150
How do you think about the
scale along the x axis?

228
00:13:25,151 --> 00:13:30,130
Is this a percentage chance of getting
hired and getting your lifetime or repeat

229
00:13:30,131 --> 00:13:34,030
the question. Repeat the question. Sorry.
So how do we scale it on the x axis?

230
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,010
Is it sort of a lifetime risk?

231
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:39,040
I tend to think of it as more
of like a snapshot in time.

232
00:13:39,041 --> 00:13:43,570
So at this point in time, if you, assuming
that you have any exposure at all,

233
00:13:43,571 --> 00:13:48,571
like you are eating fish or you are
living in a world where there is elemental

234
00:13:48,701 --> 00:13:53,470
mercury, what is your likelihood?
So it's a little bit personalized,

235
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,930
right? Not Everybody's going to
have the same level of exposure,

236
00:13:56,200 --> 00:14:00,310
which is one of the reasons why we ask
people not to read too much into our

237
00:14:00,311 --> 00:14:04,120
worry index, but related, think
about how this might apply to you.

238
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:05,900
Okay.

239
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:06,290
All right.

240
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:11,090
You're next worry is in honor
of a brain awareness week,

241
00:14:11,091 --> 00:14:14,000
which is actually an international
event going on next week.

242
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:18,410
Is your brain eating Amoeba?
Uh,

243
00:14:18,411 --> 00:14:22,250
and this was actually something that was
in the newspaper. I just very recently,

244
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,850
uh,
there was a case in Washington.

245
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:30,230
And so you may have seen the headlines
in Seattle times and on the news. So,

246
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,690
uh, again, on your sheets of paper,

247
00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:37,610
where would this worry be?
Pick which quadrant it should be.

248
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:39,860
And again,
just to help you out,

249
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:43,440
looks like most people are finished.

250
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:48,150
So raise your hand if this
is a concern of yours,

251
00:14:48,151 --> 00:14:52,190
that it's unlikely to happen and
there's nothing can do to stop it.

252
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:57,650
Unlikely that happen, but there's nothing
you can do to stop it. How about, uh,

253
00:14:57,670 --> 00:15:00,350
the above that it's unlikely to happen,

254
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:04,730
but there is something you can do
about it. Maybe a few more people.

255
00:15:05,090 --> 00:15:09,470
How about it's very likely to
happen to you. Uh, and you can,

256
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:13,730
uh, it's likely to happen and
you can't do anything about it.

257
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:17,120
So would likely it happened
that the bottom right hand side.

258
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:21,920
And how about just above that this is
something that you should worry about.

259
00:15:23,770 --> 00:15:26,960
Alright, this is what replaced it. Uh,

260
00:15:26,961 --> 00:15:29,960
it's something that is
very unlikely to happen.

261
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:32,510
There is something that
you can do about it,

262
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:36,530
but it has a large circle
because if it happens to you,

263
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:39,350
it's 97% fatal.
Okay.

264
00:15:39,351 --> 00:15:41,630
So what is a brain eating Amoeba?

265
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:46,850
It's a small single celled
organism that is found in warm,

266
00:15:46,851 --> 00:15:51,500
fresh water. Uh, if it's in
a inhaled, through your nose,

267
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:54,230
in many, not in many
cases, in a few cases,

268
00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:58,240
it gets into the upper part
of your nose where it, uh,

269
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:01,820
then crawls, I guess if
an Amoeba crawls, uh,

270
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:06,830
through the sinuses up to your brain
where it starts eating brain tissue,

271
00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:11,600
and that's bad as you might imagine.
Uh, but it's very unlikely to happen.

272
00:16:11,601 --> 00:16:15,800
Many waters are contaminated
with this Amoeba,

273
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:20,270
but very few people come down with it. In
fact, for the last about 30 years or so,

274
00:16:20,271 --> 00:16:25,130
there's only been about 150 cases or so.
So it's very unlikely to happen,

275
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:28,350
even though a lot of
water is contaminated. Uh,

276
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:33,460
you can also not contract the
disease by swallowing the water.

277
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:38,390
It must go into your nasal passages. So
it was just cause you swallow the water,

278
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:42,230
the Amoebas killed in
your digestive system. Um,

279
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:44,180
the other way you can get it if you don't,

280
00:16:44,181 --> 00:16:47,800
if you're not in this fresh water in
like a spa or something like that. Uh,

281
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:50,150
there's a device called a Neti pot.

282
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:54,140
So some people use a Neti pot
to clean out their sinuses.

283
00:16:54,141 --> 00:16:59,141
You're supposed to use
purified or sterilized water
and then you kind of tip the

284
00:16:59,211 --> 00:17:03,440
pot into your nose to clean your sinuses.
Well, if that water is contaminated,

285
00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:07,670
then the Amoeba can get up in your nose
and it can then crawl into your brain.

286
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:12,800
And I'm sorry to say kill you. Uh, so, uh,

287
00:17:12,801 --> 00:17:14,810
again,
not something to worry about,

288
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:19,340
but the headlines make it as if it is
something that you should worry about.

289
00:17:19,370 --> 00:17:21,610
The Seattle Times had a big
headline, you know, brainy didn't,

290
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:26,420
Amoeba doctor says it can happen to
you. Right? But very, very unlikely,

291
00:17:26,810 --> 00:17:31,640
even though it's a somewhat common
bacteria, so nothing to worry about.

292
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:33,020
Uh,
the next one.

293
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:35,690
Okay, so flame retardants. First of all,

294
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:38,480
does everybody know what I mean
when I talk about flame retardants?

295
00:17:38,810 --> 00:17:42,140
These are chemicals that are
added a lot of times to furniture,

296
00:17:42,141 --> 00:17:43,430
most commonly furniture.

297
00:17:43,431 --> 00:17:48,431
Also baby toys and bouncers and
stuff and carpets and car seats,

298
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:52,800
um, in order obviously to stop
him from catching on fire.

299
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:57,180
So now that you know what they are,
write down quickly what you think. Yeah,

300
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:02,770
no, that's a separate check.
Different chapter. Yeah. The risk

301
00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:11,250
of being injured by flame retardants.
Yeah. So here's our, just to remind you,

302
00:18:11,251 --> 00:18:13,320
here's our plot to put it
in one of these quadrants,

303
00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:19,150
although that's an interesting question
about whether it's being injured by,

304
00:18:19,151 --> 00:18:21,850
or the lack of both.
Obviously it could be a problem,

305
00:18:21,851 --> 00:18:26,060
but in this case we're talking
about the chemicals. Okay.

306
00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:31,460
So who thinks we belonged down here?
Not really a problem.

307
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:35,400
Okay.
How about up here?

308
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:38,810
A few as well.

309
00:18:38,810 --> 00:18:41,420
So that would be in the unlikely
and you can do something about it.

310
00:18:41,421 --> 00:18:44,930
So it's highly preventable,
but not highly likely.

311
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,720
How about it's likely to happen,
but you can't really do anything about it,

312
00:18:47,721 --> 00:18:48,920
so don't worry about it.

313
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:50,120
Okay.

314
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:52,550
Okay. And how many think it's
something to worry about?

315
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:57,150
Okay.
So I'll tell you that this is the,

316
00:18:57,151 --> 00:19:00,750
this is the topic that sent
me kind of over the edge. Um,

317
00:19:00,751 --> 00:19:04,080
I was worried about flame retardants in
our sofa and I actually made my husband

318
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:08,520
take our sofa out to the garage and we
lived without a sofa for several months.

319
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:11,700
And I'll tell you why.
So before I do, let me,

320
00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:14,640
let me show you where we assigned it and
explain a little bit about this plot.

321
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:15,930
Okay.
So first of all,

322
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:19,530
this circle right here is it looks
like it's slightly off to the left,

323
00:19:19,531 --> 00:19:24,531
but it's meant to be centered right on
the 50% line and it's about 50% size.

324
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:28,470
Um, and that means actually when
I give something a score of 50 50,

325
00:19:28,471 --> 00:19:31,590
it means I have no idea. Okay? So this is,

326
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:35,700
this is what I like to call in the
zone of the uncertainty. All right.

327
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:38,760
And the reason for that is because when
we're talking about flame retardant

328
00:19:38,761 --> 00:19:39,420
chemicals,

329
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:43,830
there are thousands of different chemicals
that are out there in the wild that

330
00:19:43,831 --> 00:19:44,820
are being used.

331
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:49,500
And most of them have actually not been
rigorously studied for their effects on

332
00:19:49,501 --> 00:19:50,334
human health.

333
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:50,910
Okay.

334
00:19:50,910 --> 00:19:53,910
So a little bit of history
on flame retardants. Um,

335
00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:59,010
they were originally added to furniture
by law in the state of California around,

336
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:02,190
Oh, I'm gonna get my date
wrong. I think it was 1975. Um,

337
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:07,200
because there's a problem with people
smoking and when they fall asleep with a

338
00:20:07,201 --> 00:20:11,520
cigarette in their mouth or close by,
they would like their furniture on fire.

339
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:15,580
And in order to get around this problem,
um,

340
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:20,600
the state of California mandated that
furniture meet a certain flame resistant

341
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:22,073
standard.

342
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:26,040
And the way that manufacturers achieve
to the standard was by adding flame

343
00:20:26,041 --> 00:20:30,540
retardant chemicals. Um, and because
California is such a huge market,

344
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:34,800
most manufacturers didn't make furniture
for the rest of the world and furniture

345
00:20:34,801 --> 00:20:38,190
for California, they just added flame
retardant chemicals to everything.

346
00:20:39,090 --> 00:20:43,290
So the problem is that many of these
chemicals are associated with all kinds of

347
00:20:43,291 --> 00:20:47,710
health problems. So enercon problems
and um, developmental problems,

348
00:20:47,711 --> 00:20:50,980
growth problems.
Cancer obviously is always on the list,

349
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:54,820
but they haven't really
been, you know, the whole,

350
00:20:54,821 --> 00:20:57,780
some of them haven't been
rigorously tested. Um,

351
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:00,850
and so we still don't really know
how big of a problem they are.

352
00:21:00,851 --> 00:21:03,790
We know that they are persistent
environmental pollutants.

353
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:07,240
So you can isolate them in a f
in the fat of Arctic polar bears,

354
00:21:07,241 --> 00:21:10,750
which turns out to be like the gold
standard for persistent environmental

355
00:21:10,751 --> 00:21:15,190
pollutant. If you can find it in a
polar bear, then we have a problem.

356
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:20,170
Right? Um, and, and they're basically
everywhere in the environment,

357
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:25,090
which is why we get pretty
low preventability score
right there in your car.

358
00:21:25,091 --> 00:21:30,091
They're in your house there or any place
that has foam in particular is often

359
00:21:30,941 --> 00:21:35,830
treated with flame retardant chemicals.
So recently about 2013,

360
00:21:36,490 --> 00:21:40,300
the state of California reversed.
It's a technical bulletin,

361
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:42,310
it's called technical bulletin one 17.

362
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:47,310
And now there's an amendment in 2013
saying you don't have to have um,

363
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:51,040
the same sort of flame retardant
properties and your furniture.

364
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:55,270
And so now it is legal to make
furniture that doesn't have added flame

365
00:21:55,271 --> 00:21:59,860
retardants and some manufacturers do.
So you can find a sofa.

366
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:00,820
Ikea makes sense,

367
00:22:00,850 --> 00:22:04,750
which is where we got our foot or non
flame retardant sofa is from Ikea.

368
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:08,620
And you can buy baby products that also
don't have flame retardants added to

369
00:22:08,621 --> 00:22:12,910
them. Okay. It's probably
worth doing, in my opinion,

370
00:22:13,090 --> 00:22:15,550
just because of the level of uncertainty.

371
00:22:15,670 --> 00:22:20,440
But I can't say for sure that this is
going to hurt you or not hurt you because

372
00:22:20,441 --> 00:22:23,800
the data is really not in on that.
Does that make,

373
00:22:23,801 --> 00:22:28,000
does that sort of makes sense as to why
it ends up in this particular zone of

374
00:22:28,001 --> 00:22:31,120
uncertainty? The other thing that
sort of surrounds this issue,

375
00:22:31,121 --> 00:22:34,330
and it gets back to his question over
here about whether we should be concerned

376
00:22:34,331 --> 00:22:36,100
about not having flame retardants.

377
00:22:36,370 --> 00:22:39,670
So is there a problem with your
furniture catching on fire?

378
00:22:39,790 --> 00:22:41,620
And the answer is probably yes.
Right?

379
00:22:41,621 --> 00:22:44,950
Like we build our furniture and many
of the things that are in our house,

380
00:22:44,951 --> 00:22:49,870
out of incredibly flammable materials
and foam in particular goes up really

381
00:22:49,871 --> 00:22:53,680
fast. It Burns really hot and it
produces lots of really toxic smoke.

382
00:22:54,670 --> 00:22:58,210
So that's obviously not ideal.

383
00:22:58,270 --> 00:23:03,270
It turns out that in tests done by
the consumer product safety division,

384
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:04,653
uh,

385
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:09,780
sofas that were treated with flame
retardants didn't actually burn any less

386
00:23:10,451 --> 00:23:11,650
quickly,
any less hot,

387
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:14,980
and they were a little bit more toxic
because of the added flame retardants.

388
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:15,760
Right?

389
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:19,420
So it's not that we don't have a problem
with our furniture catching on fire.

390
00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:23,260
It's less of a problem now because fewer
people smoke in bed or in their couches

391
00:23:23,261 --> 00:23:27,160
or whatever. Um, but we do have
incredibly flammable furniture.

392
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:29,620
It's just the flame returnings
don't really help with that problem.

393
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:35,140
So good news and bad news there.
So now as I promised you,

394
00:23:35,141 --> 00:23:39,340
we're going to talk about some tips
for doing it yourself. Right? So, um,

395
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:42,790
the first thing I'll say is that
when we started on this project,

396
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:47,300
at least I thought that it was going to
be much easier to do than it turned out

397
00:23:47,301 --> 00:23:51,200
to be because I thought, I have a
phd and I know how to read a paper.

398
00:23:51,410 --> 00:23:54,680
I'll just go to the literature and I
will read papers and I will decide.

399
00:23:55,610 --> 00:23:57,140
And it turned out to be really hard to do,

400
00:23:57,590 --> 00:24:02,390
partly because it's really
hard to identify good sources
in a field that is not

401
00:24:02,391 --> 00:24:03,950
your own field.
Right?

402
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:09,650
So we had to spend some time thinking
about how we really were going to identify

403
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:14,030
good sources and credible sources and then
come and sort of condense information.

404
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,100
So we came up with a tip sheet,

405
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:19,250
which we've actually included in the
appendix of the book and I'm going to give

406
00:24:19,251 --> 00:24:21,380
it to you for free right here.
All my secrets right now.

407
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:26,930
So the first thing that I would suggest
is first to identify your priorities,

408
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:30,340
the things that you would like to worry
about. And that's because you know,

409
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:32,790
we created this worry index.
Um,

410
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,270
but it's based on what we
think is worth worrying about,

411
00:24:35,271 --> 00:24:38,540
not necessarily what everybody else
thinks is worth worrying about it.

412
00:24:38,541 --> 00:24:42,320
And everybody is different. Everybody's
individual. So you have to make your own,

413
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:43,523
um,

414
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:47,240
sort of priorities before you even start
because otherwise you can dig yourself

415
00:24:47,270 --> 00:24:50,300
into a very deep hole very quickly.
Okay.

416
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:52,940
The second point is to
use credible sources.

417
00:24:53,090 --> 00:24:55,970
And this is the part where I really
see people going wrong quickly.

418
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:58,370
I have seen many,

419
00:24:58,550 --> 00:25:03,260
many poorly informed people on the
Internet spreading their ideas.

420
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:07,220
Okay? And it's not always
intentional. I think people,

421
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:08,720
there's a lot of misunderstanding,

422
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:14,600
but you don't want to take
somebody misunderstanding
and use it as the guide for

423
00:25:14,601 --> 00:25:18,590
your life. Right? And that means
that you need to seek out expertise.

424
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:22,550
And we live in a time right now where
expertise is perhaps a little undervalued.

425
00:25:23,170 --> 00:25:26,210
Um, and I think that's
unfortunate. I think that, um,

426
00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:29,870
when people spend all of their time
and effort learning about something,

427
00:25:29,990 --> 00:25:32,540
they probably have something
useful to say about it.

428
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:36,140
And we should seek out those people
when we're trying to make our decisions.

429
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:40,700
Anybody can have an opinion, but not
everybody's opinion is equally valid.

430
00:25:41,090 --> 00:25:45,740
Okay. Um, the other thing that I
would say is to read laterally,

431
00:25:45,770 --> 00:25:47,660
which is a new term to me,
so I'll just define it.

432
00:25:47,690 --> 00:25:50,870
You might already be completely
familiar with it. So the idea is that,

433
00:25:50,871 --> 00:25:53,780
especially on the Internet,
if you're reading vertically,

434
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:56,960
you're starting at the top and you're
reading down to the bottom right?

435
00:25:57,380 --> 00:26:02,380
And that doesn't always give you as much
information about that source as you

436
00:26:02,541 --> 00:26:04,460
would like.
So to read laterally,

437
00:26:04,461 --> 00:26:09,080
what you do is you actually open a new
tab and then you search for the source

438
00:26:09,081 --> 00:26:12,290
that you're looking at and see what
other people have to say about it, right?

439
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:14,510
Because the Internet being what it is,

440
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:17,600
there will probably be other people who
have thought about what that source is

441
00:26:17,601 --> 00:26:19,340
and whether or not it's a reliable source.

442
00:26:19,730 --> 00:26:24,350
And so whenever you're deciding whether
you should believe what you read,

443
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:27,290
you should think about who it
is that's telling you that,

444
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:31,850
why they're telling you that what their
credentials are for telling you that,

445
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:33,440
what their biases are behind that.

446
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:38,210
We usually recommend that people start
with government agencies and people don't

447
00:26:38,211 --> 00:26:41,120
like to hear start with a
government agency, right?

448
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:44,100
But let me just say this.

449
00:26:44,490 --> 00:26:47,100
The government funds
science out of public funds,

450
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:51,840
which means that the requirements
for transparency are very high. Okay.

451
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:57,180
Grants are reviewed by other scientist.
Papers are reviewed by other scientists,

452
00:26:57,330 --> 00:26:58,320
governments,
um,

453
00:26:58,590 --> 00:27:02,070
government labs that do research have to
post their data and make their methods

454
00:27:02,071 --> 00:27:06,150
available. Okay? That is not the
case for private think tanks.

455
00:27:06,390 --> 00:27:09,090
And it may not be clear where
their money is coming from,

456
00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:12,150
why they're giving you that information.
So

457
00:27:13,770 --> 00:27:15,960
think what you may about
government agencies,

458
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:18,000
but it's at least a very
good place to start.

459
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:20,550
So I always like the national
institutes of health.

460
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:24,120
There are multiple institutes of health.
They often produce fact sheets,

461
00:27:24,121 --> 00:27:27,090
which are very helpful.
The Centers for Disease Control,

462
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:28,650
the World Health Organization,

463
00:27:28,651 --> 00:27:33,150
while not being truly a
governmental agency is also
very reliable source and the

464
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:34,920
FDA as well.
Okay.

465
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:40,020
Seek out expertise and then
look for consensus in the field.

466
00:27:40,290 --> 00:27:44,010
So I say this because I actually teach
it in medical school and I have my

467
00:27:44,011 --> 00:27:46,600
students review scientific papers for me.
Um,

468
00:27:46,650 --> 00:27:51,650
and I always have a student that reviews
a paper about the dangers of vaccines.

469
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:56,130
Okay.
And here's my point about that.

470
00:27:56,250 --> 00:28:00,840
Vaccines Aren't covered in the book, first
of all. So my point about that is yes,

471
00:28:00,841 --> 00:28:05,580
you can always find some scientific
literature that will review the risks.

472
00:28:05,581 --> 00:28:08,850
And it's not that there aren't any risks
and it's not that those things aren't

473
00:28:08,851 --> 00:28:09,810
worth investigating,

474
00:28:10,050 --> 00:28:15,050
but you need to look at the entire body
of literature surrounding any topic

475
00:28:15,090 --> 00:28:16,830
before you make a decision.
Okay?

476
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:19,860
There are lots of different
opinions in science and that's good.

477
00:28:19,950 --> 00:28:21,540
There should be lots
of different opinions.

478
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:26,960
But when you're trying to figure out
sort of the global truth about a topic,

479
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:32,880
what everybody thinks is going to
settle closer to the truth than what any

480
00:28:32,881 --> 00:28:37,200
individual thinks. So it's important to
think about what everybody is saying,

481
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:39,000
not just what one paper says.

482
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:44,040
One paper is never enough to
make a decision about anything.

483
00:28:44,850 --> 00:28:49,380
Um, and then finally or not
finally, I have more next, um,

484
00:28:49,381 --> 00:28:52,350
I would say understand probabilities
at least a little bit, okay?

485
00:28:52,351 --> 00:28:55,080
Because scientists like to
speak and probabilities,

486
00:28:55,081 --> 00:28:58,080
which can be very frustrating for people.
They want to know,

487
00:28:58,260 --> 00:29:00,570
will this give me cancer or not?
Right?

488
00:29:00,810 --> 00:29:03,990
But that's not how life works
because everything is multifactorial.

489
00:29:03,991 --> 00:29:08,991
So everything has a probability or a
chance of impacting anything happening to

490
00:29:09,031 --> 00:29:13,530
you. And a scientist will very
rarely say if you eat this,

491
00:29:13,531 --> 00:29:15,240
you will die of cancer,
right?

492
00:29:15,510 --> 00:29:19,020
They will say this will increase
your risk of dying of cancer. Okay?

493
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:24,240
So think about what that means,
really, how it applies to you,

494
00:29:24,241 --> 00:29:27,420
how it applies to your
particular risk category, right?

495
00:29:27,630 --> 00:29:30,690
Cause not everything is going to
apply to everybody in the same way.

496
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:36,750
I would say be skeptical and this is a
skill that we maybe have lost a little

497
00:29:36,751 --> 00:29:37,584
bit,
right?

498
00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:42,710
It's important for somebody to convince
you of why what they're saying is true,

499
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:48,040
right? First, when you hear
something, when somebody says to you,

500
00:29:48,041 --> 00:29:50,080
you should definitely
panic about this right now.

501
00:29:50,530 --> 00:29:54,430
Your first instinct should be why?
Why should I panic about that right now?

502
00:29:54,431 --> 00:29:58,870
And if you give me a good reason, then
maybe a little panic about it, right? Um,

503
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:02,260
and then actually my last point is
I would say don't panic about it.

504
00:30:02,261 --> 00:30:04,600
And that's how that's easier said
than done even for me, right?

505
00:30:04,601 --> 00:30:05,411
I can stand here and say,

506
00:30:05,411 --> 00:30:08,380
don't panic about it and then I'll go
home and have a little minor freak out

507
00:30:08,410 --> 00:30:09,370
about something.
Right?

508
00:30:09,850 --> 00:30:14,850
But for me and I think for everybody
it can help to make an action plan.

509
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:19,810
Right and do something about the things
that you can do something about and stop

510
00:30:19,811 --> 00:30:22,240
worrying about the things that
you can't do anything about.

511
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:23,890
I'm not the first person
to have said that.

512
00:30:24,130 --> 00:30:28,300
I'm just suggesting that you apply a
logical and rigorous method to thinking

513
00:30:28,301 --> 00:30:29,710
about the things that
you want to worry about.

514
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:36,880
Would you like to add anything
doctor telling him. Okay. Okay. Um,

515
00:30:36,970 --> 00:30:39,310
so at this point we have a couple of
minutes so we could go through a couple

516
00:30:39,311 --> 00:30:41,650
more examples or we could go to questions.

517
00:30:42,890 --> 00:30:47,810
Hi, I'm so I'm wondering
if you have anything to say
about the disconnect between

518
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:51,140
what you may logically understand is
something not to be worried about,

519
00:30:51,141 --> 00:30:55,460
but I'm subconsciously
or against your logic,

520
00:30:55,461 --> 00:30:56,840
you are worrying about it anyway.

521
00:30:57,170 --> 00:31:01,010
And I think for a lot of people was
probably the size of the bubble is a

522
00:31:01,011 --> 00:31:03,710
indicator of how much they'll worry about
it regardless of where it is on that

523
00:31:03,711 --> 00:31:08,540
plot. So do you have any techniques for
how to let your logical thinking starts

524
00:31:08,550 --> 00:31:09,383
overcome the worry?

525
00:31:09,670 --> 00:31:11,080
Well,
I can tell you what works for me,

526
00:31:11,081 --> 00:31:13,210
but I don't know that that
would work for everybody in.

527
00:31:13,211 --> 00:31:14,920
Eric probably has a
comment on that as well,

528
00:31:14,921 --> 00:31:18,570
although I don't think he
worries in general as much
as I worry about things. Um,

529
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:23,910
so for me this process actually really
helps to go through and look at what the

530
00:31:24,401 --> 00:31:28,540
evidence is and then to make a conscious
decision and then remind myself every

531
00:31:28,541 --> 00:31:31,180
now and then like I already decided
I'm not going to worry about flame

532
00:31:31,181 --> 00:31:35,500
retardants cause I can't do anything
more about it. Um, you know,

533
00:31:36,130 --> 00:31:39,370
but that doesn't,
that's not always enough for everybody,

534
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,770
especially if you tend to
be a hiring anxiety person.

535
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:45,100
And there are other techniques
obviously for just dealing with stress.

536
00:31:45,101 --> 00:31:49,240
Like exercise is really good at reducing
people's stress level or meditating or

537
00:31:49,241 --> 00:31:52,870
praying or you know,
a lot of other techniques.

538
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:56,530
The world is a stressful place and like
there's no way that you're going to

539
00:31:56,531 --> 00:32:01,360
eliminate all of the things that could
potentially kill you or hurt you. Um,

540
00:32:01,361 --> 00:32:03,610
so in,
in some sense you have to,

541
00:32:03,670 --> 00:32:06,820
you have to come to grips with
that and whatever way you can.

542
00:32:07,690 --> 00:32:10,240
So this can help to some extent,
but maybe not all the way.

543
00:32:10,270 --> 00:32:11,103
That's what I would say.

544
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:13,030
Yeah. And you might
think to yourself, well,

545
00:32:13,031 --> 00:32:18,031
why would someone have worry about a
particular thing if they're really,

546
00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:20,380
logic doesn't point that direction.

547
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:24,010
And I think part of that reason is
because some of these things that happen

548
00:32:24,011 --> 00:32:26,860
rarely. For example,
shark attacks. All right,

549
00:32:26,861 --> 00:32:29,740
some people are afraid of
getting eaten by a shark.

550
00:32:30,010 --> 00:32:34,810
How many people do think a
year get killed by sharks?

551
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,150
Just throw out some numbers.

552
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:42,440
305 in the entire world,

553
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:44,510
how many people do you think get attacked?

554
00:32:44,511 --> 00:32:48,950
An unprovoked shark attack in the
world? What number? No, not killed.

555
00:32:48,951 --> 00:32:53,030
Just attack the bitten by a shark. How
minute? Throw it in with some numbers.

556
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:57,710
That 50, 50, 10. Yeah. So now you're,
you're kind of going down now,

557
00:32:57,950 --> 00:33:00,170
but it's about, it's about,
it's less, it's less, it's less.

558
00:33:00,171 --> 00:33:02,510
It's less than a hundred
in the entire world.

559
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:05,900
I think of all the millions of
people that swim in the ocean,

560
00:33:06,650 --> 00:33:09,980
yet people are afraid of
shark attack, right? Well,

561
00:33:09,981 --> 00:33:14,270
it's because when a shark attack
does happen, it's horrific, right?

562
00:33:14,330 --> 00:33:19,310
So the, every time a surfers surf
board gets chomped by a shark,

563
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,840
it's in the news,
right?

564
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:24,560
And so the media plays up these
things and plays on people's fears.

565
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:29,270
And so that might cause some
illogical fears and worries in people.

566
00:33:29,630 --> 00:33:31,160
But when you look at the real data,

567
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:33,470
a lot of these things are
nothing to worry about.

568
00:33:35,990 --> 00:33:37,700
Hi.
Hi.

569
00:33:37,830 --> 00:33:39,150
You mentioned that,
uh,

570
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:42,250
when I did research and I should
look at the entire body of science to

571
00:33:42,251 --> 00:33:44,250
scientific literature,
not just read one piece,

572
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:48,150
but I think historically a lot of things
have been breakthroughs because they

573
00:33:48,151 --> 00:33:51,930
were in the minority, are unique.
For example, with Darwin and Galileo,

574
00:33:51,931 --> 00:33:55,620
I mean it's, and these people have
historically always been persecuted.

575
00:33:56,130 --> 00:34:00,870
So I guess my question is like,
nowadays the people who are into,

576
00:34:00,930 --> 00:34:04,650
uh, anti Max probably
feel that way, right?

577
00:34:04,651 --> 00:34:07,290
And I can't convince them they're wrong.

578
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:08,990
And I

579
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:12,380
wondering how do I interact
with people who feel this way?

580
00:34:13,730 --> 00:34:15,560
I feel like we have multiple
questions and there's,

581
00:34:15,561 --> 00:34:17,300
let me see if I can
unpack them a little bit.

582
00:34:17,570 --> 00:34:21,740
So first is the point about
science has always been, you know,

583
00:34:21,741 --> 00:34:23,660
the minority is pushing it forward.
I don't,

584
00:34:23,690 --> 00:34:26,840
I think that that's actually an
exception rather than a rule.

585
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:31,460
So it's notable when it happens because
it happens rarely, not all the time.

586
00:34:31,490 --> 00:34:34,760
Right? Um, so yes, it
does sometimes happen.

587
00:34:34,761 --> 00:34:36,770
So you have to acknowledge that sometimes,
you know,

588
00:34:36,771 --> 00:34:40,310
everybody thinks there's an
ether and there's not. Right. Um,

589
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:44,990
but often science moves forward through
lots of small steps and a group of

590
00:34:44,991 --> 00:34:48,560
people pushing something forward.
Right? Um, so that's the first thing.

591
00:34:48,561 --> 00:34:50,180
The second thing is,
you're right,

592
00:34:50,181 --> 00:34:53,960
you will never convince somebody
against their will, right?

593
00:34:53,961 --> 00:34:58,580
If people have, you know,
people don't want to be wrong,

594
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:03,570
so there's only so much you
can do. And I think, um,

595
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:07,250
in some ways you have to just
be peace with that, right?

596
00:35:07,251 --> 00:35:09,380
Like you can't convince
everybody all the time,

597
00:35:09,530 --> 00:35:12,740
but you can only do what you can do about
yourself and make choices for yourself

598
00:35:12,741 --> 00:35:14,960
and make choices for your
family. And that's, um,

599
00:35:16,010 --> 00:35:20,820
at least my opinion on how to interact
with people. Um, I still try, I'm a,

600
00:35:20,821 --> 00:35:25,280
I'm a huge sort of science advocate and
advocate for logical thinking and for

601
00:35:25,281 --> 00:35:30,080
looking at data. Um, you know, the
day that our book was released,

602
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:34,910
I got an angry email from somebody
about fluoride, right? And there,

603
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:38,100
you know, I can't, I can't
change that person's mind.

604
00:35:38,310 --> 00:35:41,730
It doesn't matter how much data
I show them, how much data,

605
00:35:41,731 --> 00:35:44,430
people research that if you don't
want to believe it, you don't.

606
00:35:46,090 --> 00:35:49,300
Quick Followup. You don't mind. You said
he can't change how other people are,

607
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:52,370
but you also said that you were
like, you advocate, thank you.

608
00:35:52,371 --> 00:35:53,230
The scientific thinking.

609
00:35:53,410 --> 00:35:56,530
I imagine you want to pass this
onto your children or your spouse.

610
00:35:56,830 --> 00:35:59,830
And my question is, how do
I help my partner at us? Uh,

611
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:02,810
how do I help my partner worry less?
And I'm asking you for a friend.

612
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:08,060
So your friend's partner,
um,

613
00:36:10,170 --> 00:36:14,780
it depends on your friend's
partner really. Um, I guess, um,

614
00:36:15,550 --> 00:36:18,580
I would, I would try and stay
away from being judgy. Right?

615
00:36:18,610 --> 00:36:23,610
So if you come to somebody with an open
mindset and an openness to talk about

616
00:36:23,771 --> 00:36:25,450
things that you're going
to get a lot farther,

617
00:36:25,690 --> 00:36:30,130
then if you come out of the gate
swinging is what I would say.

618
00:36:30,650 --> 00:36:31,483
Maybe you have

619
00:36:31,570 --> 00:36:32,080
no,
no.

620
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:37,080
And I think it's a lost skill that perhaps
we may not be able to change a adults

621
00:36:37,451 --> 00:36:37,841
thinking,

622
00:36:37,841 --> 00:36:42,841
but trying to culture critical
thinking skills in children and,

623
00:36:43,650 --> 00:36:47,860
and young students. Perhaps that's the
one way we can combat some of this,

624
00:36:47,890 --> 00:36:49,570
these false hoods that we know about.

625
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:53,760
Thank you. Thanks for speaking. Um,

626
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:59,170
I was wondering how like preventability
interacts with things that are like as a

627
00:36:59,641 --> 00:37:00,600
group preventable,

628
00:37:00,601 --> 00:37:04,140
but as an individual you can do very
little about like climate change as an

629
00:37:04,141 --> 00:37:07,800
example that individual a,
we can almost do nothing but yeah.

630
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:10,650
Would be addressable if we,
if there were a group action.

631
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:12,750
So,
uh,

632
00:37:12,770 --> 00:37:17,480
in the book we really only thought about
things you can do personally to prevent.

633
00:37:17,690 --> 00:37:22,190
Um, obviously corporate action is
a much more difficult problem. Um,

634
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:26,190
and you know, I'm not, I'm not, I
don't have any great answers for that.

635
00:37:26,191 --> 00:37:30,890
And I think like vote is obviously
a big one. Um, but not perfect.

636
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:34,930
And um, you know, community organization
and a number of other things. It's,

637
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:36,080
I that's a tough night.

638
00:37:36,550 --> 00:37:37,630
That's the only thing.
Yeah.

639
00:37:37,631 --> 00:37:41,260
That's the only thing that I thought of
is voting for the types of things that

640
00:37:41,261 --> 00:37:44,890
you think uh, people should
be doing. Yeah. Vote.

641
00:37:46,050 --> 00:37:49,310
Um, so my question might
be able to be collated.

642
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:52,580
I've noticed there are certain
cases where our warriors,

643
00:37:52,590 --> 00:37:53,990
even though they own them,

644
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:58,020
unlike you cite the fact that
we are worried changes it.

645
00:37:58,470 --> 00:38:01,380
So makes it unlikely.
Let me give an example.

646
00:38:01,650 --> 00:38:06,290
Let's say turning America into
dictatorship. Theocracy. Anything goes.

647
00:38:06,291 --> 00:38:07,170
It is not today.

648
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:12,600
It's not happening in the priorities low
because we worry about it all the time

649
00:38:12,601 --> 00:38:15,360
because we kind of do something about it.

650
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:18,960
So if it's low,
right?

651
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:22,530
If you look at the probability
is low impact is high,

652
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:25,710
but it's low because of our worries.
What do you think about that?

653
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:29,370
I mean, so yeah. I mean,

654
00:38:29,850 --> 00:38:32,610
when I see students that are about to
defend their dissertations and they're

655
00:38:32,611 --> 00:38:33,810
really stressed out about it,
I'm like,

656
00:38:33,811 --> 00:38:36,280
I'm not worried about you because
you're about it. And you know,

657
00:38:36,281 --> 00:38:39,250
if you weren't worried about it than
I would be worried. And I think,

658
00:38:39,370 --> 00:38:42,040
I think that's sort of
a similar situation. Um,

659
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:44,080
but I actually think that that means that,

660
00:38:44,081 --> 00:38:46,540
that it is high on the
preventability scale. Right.

661
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:50,140
But it doesn't happen because it is
preventable and we take action against it

662
00:38:50,141 --> 00:38:55,130
and that prevents it from happening.
But it's slow. The appropriate, well,

663
00:38:55,490 --> 00:38:59,590
it's unlikely to happen because it's
highly preventable I guess is what I would

664
00:38:59,591 --> 00:39:00,424
say.
Yes.

665
00:39:00,550 --> 00:39:01,690
And that's actually interesting.

666
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:04,990
Perhaps that's a new chapter
for the book and that would be,

667
00:39:05,050 --> 00:39:10,050
should you worry about worry
and the answer is probably yes.

668
00:39:10,210 --> 00:39:14,980
Because we're in does have physiological
effects. It could reduce your sleep,

669
00:39:15,250 --> 00:39:18,220
can cause stress,
which caused other physiological problems.

670
00:39:18,340 --> 00:39:22,550
So we're in about worrying is probably
something that we should worry about it.

671
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:26,740
Thank you for do something
about it. Yeah. Yeah.

672
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:31,250
You mentioned about the, um,
government organizations, but you know,

673
00:39:31,251 --> 00:39:35,540
we have some examples like Flint, you
know, crisis where they weren't truthful.

674
00:39:35,541 --> 00:39:40,040
So how do you, um, look critically,
uh, government sources as well?

675
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:42,200
So I guess first of all,

676
00:39:42,201 --> 00:39:45,400
I would distinguish between different
kinds of government organizations.

677
00:39:45,401 --> 00:39:47,480
So when I'm talking about
governor government organizations,

678
00:39:47,481 --> 00:39:51,710
I'm talking about research based
government organizations, um,

679
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:56,570
not necessarily city or government
officials that are enacting policy.

680
00:39:56,571 --> 00:40:01,250
I think that's, that's slightly
different. Um, but again,

681
00:40:01,251 --> 00:40:06,251
so I think government fact sheets are
good places to start and in some cases I

682
00:40:07,251 --> 00:40:09,020
think they're good
places to finish as well.

683
00:40:09,021 --> 00:40:10,730
But if it's something that
you're concerned about,

684
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:14,660
then there are other
resources and, um, you know,

685
00:40:14,661 --> 00:40:18,080
there's other governments with
other, other facts sheets, right?

686
00:40:18,081 --> 00:40:19,070
So that works as well.

687
00:40:19,071 --> 00:40:23,090
So like the National Health Service in
the UK produces their own set of fact

688
00:40:23,091 --> 00:40:27,590
sheets and you can compare, but then you
can also go to the primary literature.

689
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:32,860
And I think I try and caution people
when they do that because the chances of

690
00:40:32,901 --> 00:40:36,410
misinterpretations if you're not part
of that field can be pretty high. Um,

691
00:40:36,530 --> 00:40:40,730
but that's always an option that's
out there. There are online databases,

692
00:40:40,731 --> 00:40:44,940
so Google scholar is the one that I
always use, but there's also pub men. Um,

693
00:40:45,020 --> 00:40:49,010
and you can look there for primary
information and seek out those sources and

694
00:40:49,011 --> 00:40:49,910
read them for yourself.

695
00:40:51,170 --> 00:40:54,730
How do you guys factor in like return
on investment for preventability?

696
00:40:54,731 --> 00:40:56,260
So something's very preventable.

697
00:40:56,261 --> 00:40:58,480
But I'd have to sell my
home and moved to Alaska.

698
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:03,830
I know, I mean, so I think
that also the, so you,

699
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:06,890
that's where, why it's like a
three dimensional problem, right?

700
00:41:06,891 --> 00:41:09,530
So it's very preventable,
but it's very unlikely.

701
00:41:09,531 --> 00:41:12,710
Probably don't sell your house
and moved to Alaska. Right? Um,

702
00:41:12,950 --> 00:41:15,890
you're increasing your odds of
getting eaten by a polar bear.

703
00:41:15,891 --> 00:41:19,110
So you have to like really factor that
in as you're making that decision. Um,

704
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:22,880
and also the size of the
risk and just prioritizing.

705
00:41:22,881 --> 00:41:27,620
Is it really that important to me that
it's worth making a major lifestyle

706
00:41:27,621 --> 00:41:28,250
change?

707
00:41:28,250 --> 00:41:32,270
And I think that's kind of what it comes
down to is get all of the data and then

708
00:41:32,271 --> 00:41:35,300
say, well, what's, what's it worth
to me? And Is it worth the cost?

709
00:41:35,301 --> 00:41:37,190
Is it really just a very
small marginal return,

710
00:41:37,191 --> 00:41:41,510
or is it gonna make a huge difference in
my quality of life and nobody can make

711
00:41:41,511 --> 00:41:45,440
that decision for you? You got to
get to do your own thing. Well,

712
00:41:45,441 --> 00:41:47,420
thank you very much for
coming to talk to us today.
