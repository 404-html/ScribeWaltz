1
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:11,560
[inaudible]

2
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:13,230
uh,
when I was planning this book,

3
00:00:13,231 --> 00:00:15,870
I thought if I wrote a
book titled Something like,

4
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:19,320
Why Einstein is smarter than us
and we're a bunch of dumb schmucks,

5
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:21,390
we're not very interested
in buying a book like that.

6
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,500
But if there is a book about poor Einstein
had these terrible problems and we

7
00:00:25,501 --> 00:00:28,380
can feel superior console him,
that's really good.

8
00:00:28,381 --> 00:00:30,250
You feel that's a pretty good day.
I'm,

9
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:33,540
I'm helping my poor little friend
Einstein. Everyone's interested in him.

10
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:36,480
I'm assuming many.
Most of us here know some of what he did.

11
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:40,110
Just to remind her aside from
minor things, put it this way,

12
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:44,130
the theory of relativity and
equals mc squared was so small.

13
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,080
That was just the beginning of his,
that he was so good.

14
00:00:46,081 --> 00:00:50,700
He had two theories of relativity.
So one in 1905 when he was 26.

15
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:55,590
Those of you who are approaching 26 feel
anxious, you have like a count down to,

16
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:58,320
uh, to getting there.
If it's any consolation,

17
00:00:58,321 --> 00:01:00,240
you can feel even more
anxious if you're younger.

18
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:04,080
There was a fellow I studied with at the
University of Chicago when I was young

19
00:01:04,081 --> 00:01:05,890
and he was old. And at one point, uh,

20
00:01:05,891 --> 00:01:10,870
this fellow was on a boat going from
India to England. And he said, oh, sorry,

21
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:13,980
it's been so many years that I'd
been striving and I'm such a failure.

22
00:01:13,981 --> 00:01:17,730
I've accomplished nothing. This is
awful. His name was Chandra say car.

23
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:22,230
The Shaundra ex-ray satellite is named
after him and he was 19 years old.

24
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:23,940
And in the midst of his despair,

25
00:01:23,941 --> 00:01:25,950
he came up with basically
the idea of black holes,

26
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:28,320
which is pretty impressive in the 1930s.
Anyway,

27
00:01:28,321 --> 00:01:32,940
so Einstein of 25 did great stuff, special
relativity. At 35, he did greater stuff.

28
00:01:32,941 --> 00:01:37,560
General relativity. If
Einstein, if nobody, if he
hadn't done special relativity,

29
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:39,870
uh, Poincare Lorenz, lots
of people have done it.

30
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:42,750
If he hadn't done general relativity,
we would still be waiting for it.

31
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:45,360
Think about that in your field.
How many things,

32
00:01:45,361 --> 00:01:48,840
if a particular organization disappears,
would not get done by anybody else?

33
00:01:48,841 --> 00:01:51,690
That's really rare and really special.
He was very good.

34
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:55,320
He wasn't just good in um, uh, in,
in science as you might imagine.

35
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:58,050
He was incredibly good in
practical technology. Uh,

36
00:01:58,051 --> 00:02:00,630
wouldn't if it's great inventions that
he was really proud of and spent a lot of

37
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,110
time on in the 1920s was the refrigerator,

38
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:05,670
new improved refrigerators,

39
00:02:05,671 --> 00:02:08,580
refrigerators in Berlin leaked all
the time and he didn't want leaky

40
00:02:08,581 --> 00:02:12,670
refrigerators so he produced a wonderful
non leaky refrigerator. There's a,

41
00:02:12,671 --> 00:02:15,310
a letter to his great friend mocks born,
um,

42
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:18,420
who also a Nobel laureate and you
wonder what Nobel laureates discuss.

43
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:22,320
My refrigerator barely leaks. The new
prototype is even better than last time.

44
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:25,830
Next time down to 3.6% leak.
Yes.

45
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:30,840
Einstein was very excited in 1916 he
needed to take a break when weekend and he

46
00:02:30,841 --> 00:02:34,140
was thinking not about refrigerators
and not about general relativity and

47
00:02:34,141 --> 00:02:37,080
casually he came up with the
key idea behind the laser,

48
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:40,140
which is pretty impressive.
The first practical ones,

49
00:02:40,141 --> 00:02:43,970
I think masers first microwaves were
only built 40 years later. Um, uh,

50
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:47,630
this organization would not work very
well if there weren't lasers zipping round

51
00:02:47,631 --> 00:02:51,120
through a fiber optics and stuff.
He also came up with the um, uh,

52
00:02:51,121 --> 00:02:54,030
the photoelectric effect. If you
think about it, there's light,

53
00:02:54,031 --> 00:02:57,840
which is kind of energy and
there's electrons which are
in substance and we take

54
00:02:57,841 --> 00:03:00,250
for granted, Oh yeah. You know,
light metals makes things happen.

55
00:03:00,251 --> 00:03:04,480
We use it in our phone cameras all the
time. How does that possibly happen?

56
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:09,370
How does light, which is energy, how
does that, how does that make stuff move?

57
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:11,890
It's really impressive.
So he came up with that in 1905.

58
00:03:11,891 --> 00:03:15,010
That wasn't even his greatest
work. Anyways, he was terrific,

59
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:18,640
but then the secret is greatest mistake.
It turned out he made a mistake,

60
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:22,090
a psychological mistake, and it
was catastrophic. And it led,

61
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:25,630
even though he was world famous and his
mind was still delayed in his forties

62
00:03:25,631 --> 00:03:29,530
and stuff, and people exactly his
age were staying on with good work.

63
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:31,000
He became shunned.

64
00:03:31,001 --> 00:03:34,090
He was the laughingstock in the physics
community when he was at Princeton.

65
00:03:34,091 --> 00:03:37,420
He was at a, what outsiders called the
Princeton Institute for Advanced Studies.

66
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:41,020
Insiders called it the Princeton
Institute for advanced salaries.

67
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:45,460
They had a lot of money to bring a good
refugee scientists over and for 30 years

68
00:03:45,461 --> 00:03:47,950
there are people would say,
Ooh, don't go near him.

69
00:03:47,951 --> 00:03:51,610
It's going to destroy your career. Ooh,
don't go near him. He's a husband. He's a,

70
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:52,870
he's an archaic nothing.

71
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:56,820
And it really hurt his feelings because
when he was young and trendy before the,

72
00:03:56,821 --> 00:04:00,580
the hair thing and stuff, he was on top
of the world. Everybody came to him.

73
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:05,380
Einstein once said that people think in
two different ways. Um, uh, quiet quiz.

74
00:04:05,381 --> 00:04:08,710
You can see which one is you. He said
they're either tennis players or golfers,

75
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:12,260
tennis players. They just need
ideas back and forth. Uh, you,

76
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:16,690
you only clarify it when you talk with
other people. Golfers are the ones who,

77
00:04:16,691 --> 00:04:19,360
you know, often the neighbors when
they're interviewed by the police,

78
00:04:19,361 --> 00:04:23,020
that he seems such a quiet and nice
young man of the golfers are the ones who

79
00:04:23,021 --> 00:04:26,980
need to sit quietly and think and
cogitate and don't disturb me.

80
00:04:26,981 --> 00:04:29,050
They go to find a little corner in a cafe.

81
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:31,480
And with that they come
up with great ideas. Well,

82
00:04:31,481 --> 00:04:35,290
it turns out Einstein was actually
a tennis player. He, he, uh, he,

83
00:04:35,291 --> 00:04:38,740
he wasn't a golfer in that respect.
And to be isolated from other people,

84
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:41,740
to have nobody come to his office and not
have bright Grad students want to work

85
00:04:41,741 --> 00:04:46,150
with him, that was awful, awful. So
it turns out how did this happen?

86
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:47,680
Why did this terrible thing happened?

87
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:52,010
And there's a curious a parallel with high
tech. So I'll start talking about, um,

88
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:55,570
some, how you see this on a large
scale, like a sort of a large display.

89
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:58,750
And then we'll zoom back in. We'll take
a microscope insight Einstein's brain.

90
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:02,590
So we'll zoom out now a little bit and
I want to talk about an organization

91
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:05,020
which some of you,
most of many of you will have heard of.

92
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:08,200
And some of you may have studied
at the Cavendish lab in Cambridge.

93
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:12,160
The Cavendish lab is about, uh,
in the 19, early 1920, sorry,

94
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:14,230
in the early 19 hundreds,

95
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:17,380
the Cavendish lab was around the
size of the floor of this building,

96
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:19,150
a little bit smaller than
the floor of this building.

97
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:23,770
It produced in a 20 year period more
Nobel Prize winners than all of France,

98
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:26,590
all of Japan,
all of Italy have ever done combined.

99
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,380
And those are countries with
terrific educational backgrounds.

100
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:32,590
Think how could a place about
half the size of this floor,

101
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:35,110
maybe with some spill out labs
of the size of this floor,

102
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:38,680
do something like that that's
above and beyond anything else.

103
00:05:38,681 --> 00:05:39,760
And it wasn't just patronage,

104
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:43,360
it wasn't that they were rigged on the
Nobel Committee. This was stunning work.

105
00:05:43,361 --> 00:05:46,210
The foundations of the modern world,
modern science,

106
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:48,280
and it turns out there were
several things they did.

107
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:51,850
A one thing was kind of small. At 6:00
PM they turned off the electricity.

108
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:54,730
You could sit there but you were in
the dark. It means you had to focus.

109
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,470
You know sometimes if you have to
give her presentation, it clears head.

110
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:00,980
If you have to give a presentation with
20 minutes prep, it's not too good.

111
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:03,080
But if you have half a day
rather than three weeks,

112
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:06,560
you'll really focus in that half day.
6:00 PM electricity was really good.

113
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:08,750
They also help with
diseases. Very, very useful.

114
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:11,720
But there are two things they did there
were even better at the Cavendish lab

115
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:15,740
and these later feedback you'll see
them taking place in Einstein's mind.

116
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:19,380
One is that they made their
own tools. Uh, a long time ago,

117
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:24,230
a an Air France used to have microphones
in the first class seats from San

118
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:25,250
Francisco to La to Paris.

119
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,800
They thought they would listen in the
French government under Mitra wrong.

120
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:31,460
They would listen to it. I'm a secrets of
Silicon Valley and copy it immediately.

121
00:06:31,461 --> 00:06:33,890
That's depressing.
Saying here's other guys who are terrific.

122
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:35,570
Let's see if we can catch up with them.

123
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:39,230
Much better is to make your own tools
and be first see who catches up with you.

124
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:42,890
There was a young guy working
at this Cavendish lab from
Germany, a Grad student.

125
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:46,670
He thought we need a better way to
detect little bits of radiation.

126
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,480
His name was Hans Geiger.
Thus the hands counter, no,

127
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:53,360
the Geiger counter a named in his honor.
They had lots of tools like that.

128
00:06:53,361 --> 00:06:57,500
It was this wonderful confidence that
was good. So 6:00 PM stops was good.

129
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:58,700
Making your own tools as good,

130
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,430
but the best of all is the guy
who ran it was a New Zealand,

131
00:07:01,431 --> 00:07:03,180
a farmer named Rutherford.
Um,

132
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:07,040
and he had a concept of what I
call a mid level abstraction.

133
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:10,820
If you tell somebody coming to a
research lab, let's be the best.

134
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:13,550
It doesn't really help you. I
mean, it applies to Nike shoes.

135
00:07:13,551 --> 00:07:14,510
It doesn't give you anything help.

136
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,000
If you say to somebody coming
to a great research lab,

137
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:18,830
give them some very detailed thing.

138
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:22,190
Phillips needs help and Jut calibrating
this microscope and we're doing an

139
00:07:22,191 --> 00:07:24,140
interesting piece of work there.
That's fine.

140
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:26,600
It's great to help Phillips and you
can be really good at microscopes,

141
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:30,260
but that's one one thing, it's too
detailed. Uh, would rather for data.

142
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:34,030
The Cavendish lab in the 19
teens in 1920s come up with what,

143
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:38,120
what is a mid level abstraction?
He had one guiding principle,

144
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:40,640
which wasn't too abstract and
wasn't too particular. He said,

145
00:07:40,641 --> 00:07:42,860
everybody who came to the lab,
you know what we're going to do,

146
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:47,660
we're going to find out what's inside the
atom. Nothing more, nothing left less.

147
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:51,290
It's a perfect idea. With that.
Everybody understands what's going on.

148
00:07:51,291 --> 00:07:53,750
Everybody can share,
but you're not telling them what to do.

149
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:55,100
You give them a real lot of freedom,

150
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:59,150
but they're still pulling together a
San Exupery, the French poet once said,

151
00:07:59,151 --> 00:08:00,920
love isn't looking into each other's eyes.

152
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:02,660
It's looking together
in the same direction.

153
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:05,750
If you've ever been in a poisonous
organization where people are pulling in

154
00:08:05,751 --> 00:08:08,690
different directions, you don't quite
understand what's going on. You don't.

155
00:08:08,691 --> 00:08:10,490
People don't understand why they
should work with each other.

156
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:13,640
You'll know how important that was.
Mid level abstraction was wonderful.

157
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:17,660
Second question. So that's how how
you create a great, uh, organization.

158
00:08:17,661 --> 00:08:21,230
In this case, the greatest research lab
the world has ever seen. Second question,

159
00:08:21,231 --> 00:08:23,750
how do they stay that way?
And the answer is they usually don't.

160
00:08:23,751 --> 00:08:25,940
They almost always fade.
Within about 20 years,

161
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:29,000
the Cavendish lab under a
Rutherford was magnificent.

162
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:32,390
Then after about the mid 1920s,
it faded away.

163
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:34,310
That approach different didn't work.

164
00:08:34,311 --> 00:08:37,280
The outside world was changing how
to find what's inside the atom.

165
00:08:37,281 --> 00:08:40,010
With tools you can make yourself
in Cambridge, it stopped.

166
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:42,410
It was really a upsetting.

167
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:46,130
So now occasionally companies can keep
on doing the same thing for a real long

168
00:08:46,131 --> 00:08:48,440
time. I worked for awhile
with a shell scenarios.

169
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:52,610
Shell has a very simple principle.
It's not abstract be the best.

170
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:56,700
It's not incredibly detailed. Do this one
arrangement with rock. It's extract oil,

171
00:08:56,730 --> 00:09:01,170
using really good engineers
and make clever political
arrangements with your, uh,

172
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,920
with the companies that supply it. It's
worked well for 120 years. So that's,

173
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:09,000
that's fine. That's a simple, unchanging
field. If they can get into clean energy,

174
00:09:09,001 --> 00:09:13,200
well I'd be surprised, pleasantly
surprised, but surprised. So,

175
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:17,340
but that's their obstruction. Usually
that doesn't work. So Einstein's life,

176
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:18,600
if we go back to him now,

177
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:21,930
he sort of solves the problem about how
you can do better than these companies

178
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,390
and he also reveals a possible answer.
So like I said,

179
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:29,320
it's going to give a little microscope
going inside his brain. So, uh,

180
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:32,460
I'll talk a bit about his creativity and
his creativity was very much like those

181
00:09:32,461 --> 00:09:35,730
big companies. So the companies, one
thing they did was the thing, you know,

182
00:09:35,731 --> 00:09:37,650
pulling the plug at 6:00
PM from electricity.

183
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:41,220
Einstein didn't have a limitation with
electricity. They often say, you know,

184
00:09:41,221 --> 00:09:44,190
you can do, um, uh, mathematics
and theoretical physics,

185
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:48,230
which just the pencil paper and a,
and a dustbin, a waste, a waste,

186
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:51,060
a wastebasket of,
they also cynics will say,

187
00:09:51,061 --> 00:09:54,270
you can do philosophy and secondly the
same way, but you don't need the dustbin,

188
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:58,350
which is kind of cruel. Einstein
himself, loved good philosophers.

189
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:02,460
A client at one point had an image of
spacetime diagrams, which is really good.

190
00:10:02,461 --> 00:10:03,001
And the 17,

191
00:10:03,001 --> 00:10:07,020
seven days Hume's notions about causality
and just looking at what you observe,

192
00:10:07,021 --> 00:10:09,930
where they're trying to understand
what's going on inside. These are great,

193
00:10:09,931 --> 00:10:13,890
powerful notions. So Einstein, the
equivalent of the 6:00 PM stop.

194
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:16,590
He had terrible problems
and relationships.

195
00:10:16,591 --> 00:10:20,060
His best friend after his best friend
died when they were both old men. Uh,

196
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:22,830
Einstein wrote to the best friend's
family, Mikayla base, I would said,

197
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:25,590
I admired your dad from being a
nice guy and a sounding board.

198
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:29,640
But what I admired best was that he made
a relationship with one woman work for

199
00:10:29,641 --> 00:10:34,530
his entire life. Something which I sadly
have failed in twice. So a Einstein had,

200
00:10:34,531 --> 00:10:37,890
has spent a lot of time moving from
apartment to apartment flat to flat,

201
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,060
escaping from one person having an affair.
Oh,

202
00:10:40,061 --> 00:10:43,990
with the wrong person going off to another
one. It really restricted as time. Uh,

203
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:47,340
sometimes he was writing in a, in trains
cause he couldn't stay in any city.

204
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:51,450
So he had, he had, he had constraints
on his time for his tools,

205
00:10:51,451 --> 00:10:55,140
developing your own tools. Uh, he
developed what's now kind of standard. He,

206
00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:58,410
he really developed a tensors,
uh, those of you who aren't, uh,

207
00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:00,810
with a technical background,
scalers are like,

208
00:11:00,811 --> 00:11:04,320
like numbers and stuff and vectors or
like a number with a direction like an

209
00:11:04,321 --> 00:11:08,270
arrow. And, um, and tensors just
generalize that a little bit more. Um,

210
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:10,610
it's in the appendix to the book.
Um,

211
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:13,740
so he developed that and he especially
developed an interesting ways of

212
00:11:13,741 --> 00:11:16,770
understanding surfaces and stuff.
It was this own fresh tools,

213
00:11:16,771 --> 00:11:20,640
which meant nobody else had it. Imagine
if you have a tool which nobody else has.

214
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:24,810
There was an athlete 40,
50 years ago who was a mid level jumper.

215
00:11:24,811 --> 00:11:28,480
He wasn't incredible, but he found
a way. Dick Fosbury of jumping back,

216
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:31,320
I think it was Dick Fosbury was his
last night of jumping backwards.

217
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:34,680
This is the famous way that high jumpers
jump. Now, when he had that tool,

218
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:38,030
nobody else did. He was great. Even
though he wasn't a stunning athlete, uh,

219
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:39,840
once everybody else had it,
he had to fade away.

220
00:11:39,841 --> 00:11:42,150
He wasn't that good
advantages to being first.

221
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:44,460
And then the other great thing
that Einstein was good at,

222
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:47,700
his mid level abstraction, that's a bit
technical. I get into it in the book.

223
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,860
It was a way of viewing how you can
view any physics problem independent of

224
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:53,740
whoever's watching,

225
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:57,030
whether I'm jumping up and down with
our moving quickly or slowly. How,

226
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:59,800
how would the world be? Look,
how would you think seem, if I,

227
00:11:59,801 --> 00:12:04,140
if everybody's able to view things and
you can't tell 'em who has a prefer a

228
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:06,880
special position,
it's kind of very much a democracy.

229
00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:08,920
I know it's kind of Waffley
to say it like that.

230
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:12,250
So I have to go leave the details in
the book. But he had his unique tools.

231
00:12:12,251 --> 00:12:15,310
He had pressures on time and had
a beautiful mid level abstraction.

232
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:18,700
He wasn't trying to solve a
particular physics problems down here,

233
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:21,460
nor was he saying, I'm going to
be the best I'm going to achieve,

234
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:26,200
I'm going to create greatness. And his has
abstractions were very, very, very good.

235
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:27,520
Um,
anyways,

236
00:12:27,521 --> 00:12:30,880
it turns out at one point he drew the
mechanism of how creativity happens inside

237
00:12:30,881 --> 00:12:34,090
his own brain. And those of you
who read German as well as I do,

238
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:37,540
which is not too well, will not
be following the German. Uh,

239
00:12:37,570 --> 00:12:39,730
what I'm going to do a while,
this slides up,

240
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:43,810
I'm going to draw something
like that roughly on the board.

241
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:46,210
So what Einstein said is down
here are things in the real world,

242
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:50,410
events and stuff that you look at.
And then we make a creative jump,

243
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:54,670
a creative leap of the imagination going
up here and from this vantage point we

244
00:12:54,671 --> 00:12:57,280
see fresh things. We're, while
we're up here, I remember,

245
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:00,040
and this is a mid level thing, it's
not incredibly high. It isn't, oh,

246
00:13:00,041 --> 00:13:03,280
I'm going to survey the world like a God,
but it's not a detail thing down here.

247
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:07,900
And from here you draw conclusions
and if the conclusions are right,

248
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:12,430
they match what's down there and then
this jump up has been correct. Right?

249
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:15,850
Very simple form that was, that
was this sort of forum. Um,

250
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:20,080
and that's what he said, how it works. And
from that perch you can see everything.

251
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:20,771
Anyways,

252
00:13:20,771 --> 00:13:24,400
it's a great idea and I assign followed
it successfully for quite a few years,

253
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:29,440
but then after about 20 years has happened
so often, he stopped following it.

254
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:33,490
I have time to tell you a little bit of
the story about how he stopped following

255
00:13:33,491 --> 00:13:38,470
it. The, the book is mostly about
that. It turns out in, um, a 19, 15,

256
00:13:38,471 --> 00:13:42,460
19, 16, a hundred years ago in
the middle of wartime of Berlin,

257
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:47,380
he came up with an equation that describes
the entire shape of the universe. Um,

258
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:49,150
uh, as a rough example. And again,

259
00:13:49,151 --> 00:13:52,390
apologies to people who've done it a
physics at a high level as a very rough

260
00:13:52,391 --> 00:13:56,470
image. Imagine that space is like a
flat trampoline or a rubber sheet.

261
00:13:56,770 --> 00:13:59,320
And if I take a little ball
bearing and flick it [inaudible],

262
00:13:59,530 --> 00:14:01,810
it'll go in a straight line.
And if I flick it in some other way,

263
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:04,170
it'll go in a straight line.
Those might be something like planets.

264
00:14:04,171 --> 00:14:05,110
We just flick them along.

265
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:10,280
You see the big finger coming down over
from south of King's cross. Okay. Uh,

266
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:14,380
if you take a rock or a heavier ball
and put it in the middle of that sheet,

267
00:14:14,381 --> 00:14:15,790
it'll sag down in that shape.
Right?

268
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,510
And think of that as like the sun or
something. Then if I flick a ball,

269
00:14:19,511 --> 00:14:22,120
bearing the ball bearing instead
of going straight, well it will,

270
00:14:22,121 --> 00:14:24,310
if it's far away,
if the sheets sagging down here,

271
00:14:24,311 --> 00:14:27,940
the ball bearing will near very rounded
like in a billiards or pool table and

272
00:14:27,941 --> 00:14:30,720
stuff. Kind of makes sense.
Again, it's only a metaphor here.

273
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:33,880
It's curving and space. In fact, in
reality it's curving in space time.

274
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:38,960
So wonderful notion. A force then
becomes just a distortion of space. Uh,

275
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:40,900
the geometry lead you along.

276
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:43,630
An example there is two people
walking to the North Pole.

277
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:46,810
You can start at different points on
the equator and you look at each other,

278
00:14:46,811 --> 00:14:49,210
you're a few yards apart and you say,
we're going to stay parallel.

279
00:14:49,211 --> 00:14:50,320
Where each going to go do north.

280
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,700
But you realize the geometry
will force you together.

281
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:55,330
You'll see this person coming closer
and closer to you. Say, oh wait,

282
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:58,400
you're not going straight hillside that
heck I am. I'm going perfectly straight.

283
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:02,360
So an intellectual what appears to be a
forest and come from a distortions of a

284
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:05,450
geometry that's a two dimensional
surface in our three dimensional space.

285
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:09,830
Space time is four dimensional,
four dimensional. So that's
how it works. Anyways,

286
00:15:09,831 --> 00:15:12,650
the details are in the book.
That isn't what matters.

287
00:15:12,651 --> 00:15:15,500
What matters is Einstein came out
of it with a beautiful equation.

288
00:15:15,501 --> 00:15:19,530
G equals t geometry. Very
roughly. Geometry, uh,

289
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:23,840
creates how things move. And the, the,
the, this structure and shape of things,

290
00:15:23,841 --> 00:15:27,680
which includes mass and energy will
shape the geometry around it. The, uh,

291
00:15:27,681 --> 00:15:31,760
the fact of a heavy bowling boil will
sad the sheet of space time around it and

292
00:15:31,761 --> 00:15:35,330
the curvature of space time will show
that there's gotta be something there.

293
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,810
You know, something they were behind it.
What a beautiful idea. Among other things.

294
00:15:38,811 --> 00:15:42,830
Einstein worked out shortly afterwards
in 1917 was that this predicted that the

295
00:15:42,831 --> 00:15:45,530
universe was expanding.
What an amazing idea.

296
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:47,720
And he went to his astronomer
for friends and said,

297
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,410
I've predicted the universe is expanding.

298
00:15:49,411 --> 00:15:52,760
At least two simple equations that seem
to reveal the truth of the universe,

299
00:15:52,761 --> 00:15:56,780
explaining the universe is expanding.
And as astronomer friends in 1917 said,

300
00:15:57,530 --> 00:16:00,320
big mistake, the data shows the
opposite. The Universe is static.

301
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:03,920
The s the Milky Way galaxies is sitting
here kind of floating and beyond.

302
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:07,580
It is avoid sort of like
looking to Donald Trump's mind.

303
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:09,300
There's just nothing there.

304
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:12,950
Maybe some malicious entities and a
little bit of sneering coming back at us.

305
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:17,420
That's it. Um, so Einstein had to put
in a modification to his equation,

306
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:21,140
the famous lamb determ and instead of
this beautiful symmetry where he thought,

307
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:24,290
not so much that he detected the
hand of God, he was, he wasn't a,

308
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:27,410
he wasn't an atheist. He wasn't,
uh, a formal religious believer.

309
00:16:27,411 --> 00:16:30,650
He was anti atheist. He said, how could
you be so sure? He was sort of in between,

310
00:16:30,651 --> 00:16:32,870
kind of like Spinosa.
If you're interested in Pantheism,

311
00:16:33,170 --> 00:16:35,870
it's quite extraordinary there.
They subtle structures there.

312
00:16:35,871 --> 00:16:37,370
He didn't know why or what they came from.

313
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:42,230
He once gave an image of humans as being
like a little boy in a big library,

314
00:16:42,231 --> 00:16:45,500
in a dark. It's at night.
There's myths, maybe foggy out.

315
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:47,900
And the the walls,
the library,

316
00:16:47,901 --> 00:16:50,960
there's all these bookshelves around
with books and in those books are the

317
00:16:50,961 --> 00:16:53,000
secrets of the universe.
They actually exist.

318
00:16:53,001 --> 00:16:54,590
They've been specified really clearly.

319
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:58,450
Very occasionally the brightest members
of our species can walk forward,

320
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:02,300
go up to one of the books, open it,
and you'll actually see it at one line,

321
00:17:02,301 --> 00:17:04,130
might say equals MC squared.
Wow.

322
00:17:04,430 --> 00:17:08,400
Another might have the tensors
behind g equals t, um, and then, oh,

323
00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:10,700
but then we usually have to close it,
go back and retreat.

324
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:15,110
But we know it's there waiting. Einstein
love that. Newton had seen some things.

325
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:18,770
Einstein had, was lucky enough to see some
things. Future generations could also,

326
00:17:18,771 --> 00:17:20,910
it's a wonderful platonic dream.
Anyway,

327
00:17:20,911 --> 00:17:24,710
so he felt bad that he had to modify that
simple gene equals t. But he said, okay,

328
00:17:24,830 --> 00:17:27,800
if the data doesn't show that it's
correct, I'll have to modify it.

329
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:32,360
So he made us equation ugly for 10 years,
10 years later, a Hubble in California,

330
00:17:32,361 --> 00:17:36,290
and other people said, boy, did we get
it wrong? Oh wait, did we get, are I,

331
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:39,740
I'm adding the oil? They probably
didn't say it like, um, and they said,

332
00:17:39,741 --> 00:17:43,100
the universe is expanding. They found this
wonderful evidence, that room, you know,

333
00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:46,430
it's expanding in each power
does expanding from the
other parts at a terrific

334
00:17:46,431 --> 00:17:50,760
rate. And Einstein was so happy at that.
He said, I knew it. I knew it all along.

335
00:17:50,761 --> 00:17:54,240
Have you ever, any of you here seen
galaxy quest? Uh, the film, uh,

336
00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:55,850
you remember there,
there's this a boy,

337
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:58,740
a teenage boy hadn't earth who believes
that aliens are speaking to them and

338
00:17:58,741 --> 00:18:01,290
stuff and nobody believes them and
stuff. He, he's, Oh yeah, I know.

339
00:18:01,291 --> 00:18:04,290
It's just made up. And then he actually
hears, sees them this way. He said,

340
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,380
I knew it. I knew all along. It was
actually true. So that was Einstein.

341
00:18:07,381 --> 00:18:10,260
After 10 years, he realized he
had to stick to his original.

342
00:18:10,261 --> 00:18:12,690
He should have stuck to his
original thing. The experiment,

343
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:16,260
experimental evidence was agreed on
by all the astronomers in the world,

344
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:20,370
but they were wrong. If he had
just held his nerve a bit longer,

345
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:21,750
he would have been proven right.

346
00:18:21,751 --> 00:18:26,010
How cool is that too simple forms
to simple tensors g equals t again,

347
00:18:26,011 --> 00:18:27,810
I'm summarizing,
but basically that,

348
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:31,590
that somebody came up with in their
head in Berlin during World War One

349
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:36,690
predicted that and drop that our local
cluster is expanding away from other

350
00:18:36,691 --> 00:18:37,620
parts of the galaxy.

351
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:42,000
How utterly extraordinary that advanced
primates can do something like that.

352
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:46,830
It was, it was wonderful.
Anyways, what conclusion did?
Um, oh, anyway, so let me see.

353
00:18:46,831 --> 00:18:49,500
So what Einstein did here,
so we came up here.

354
00:18:49,501 --> 00:18:53,400
So one of his principles there would be
say g equals t and the things he found

355
00:18:53,401 --> 00:18:56,520
there, it, it showed that the
universe was expanding. Um,

356
00:18:56,580 --> 00:19:00,600
so I'll do like that it shows the
universe was expanding. It also, um, uh,

357
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:02,750
famously described, um, uh,

358
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:06,760
it explained how mercury wobbled as it
went around the sun. Mercury's orbit.

359
00:19:06,761 --> 00:19:09,930
It wasn't quite what you would think.
The, the curve down there by the sun,

360
00:19:09,931 --> 00:19:11,100
the decay of the,
uh,

361
00:19:11,101 --> 00:19:15,420
of that trampoline or rubber sheet was
greater than Newton winter predicted. Um,

362
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:17,790
mercury I believe is that so,

363
00:19:17,791 --> 00:19:20,940
so that was under there and he had all
sorts of predictions and they really held

364
00:19:20,941 --> 00:19:25,570
up. It was when he, um, and that
was the simple Gecos teak anyway,

365
00:19:25,571 --> 00:19:28,890
so all that's good. Do you think, okay,
they're technical mistake he gave in,

366
00:19:28,891 --> 00:19:31,320
he shouldn't have given him it sort of
like, they often say in business, uh,

367
00:19:31,321 --> 00:19:34,170
reinforce a victory,
a star of defeat.

368
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:38,010
But of course when his victory you release
a new product is not doing that well.

369
00:19:38,011 --> 00:19:40,980
Maybe macro penetration and slightly
give it a little bit longer.

370
00:19:40,981 --> 00:19:44,520
It's really good. Bit more, adds a bit
more improvements and tweaks. We have it.

371
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:46,320
At what point do you stop?

372
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:50,760
Einstein thought that he had
stopped too soon anyways, from this,

373
00:19:50,761 --> 00:19:55,050
he drew a catastrophic conclusion.
He decided that, um, when,

374
00:19:55,051 --> 00:19:57,360
when never had to listen,
listen to experimental evidence.

375
00:19:57,510 --> 00:20:01,900
If you believe that something clear and
simple had been found right, that the,

376
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:03,480
the, those, those instructions,

377
00:20:03,481 --> 00:20:06,930
that the divinity or the divine forces
or just the facts of the universe had

378
00:20:06,931 --> 00:20:09,600
made,
he was a kind of a ambiguous on it,

379
00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:11,970
that that would have to be super clear.

380
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:15,150
Those things you found in the books
in the library, they had to be really,

381
00:20:15,151 --> 00:20:16,310
really simple.
Um,

382
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:20,160
quantum mechanics started coming in
around this time and Einstein had helped

383
00:20:20,161 --> 00:20:23,490
create quantum mechanics in 1905,
but in the late 1920s,

384
00:20:23,610 --> 00:20:26,580
it was getting even better at the
famous Heisenberg uncertainty principle,

385
00:20:26,581 --> 00:20:30,020
a things like that. Einstein Thought, oh,
this is all very interesting. The, the,

386
00:20:30,021 --> 00:20:34,620
the mathematics is, is, is really good,
and it's a temporary EPA phenomenon. Uh,

387
00:20:34,621 --> 00:20:37,500
our equipment, you can't tell exactly
what's going on. And of course,

388
00:20:37,501 --> 00:20:40,440
probability is very useful. His
early work on, on, on the lasers,

389
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:44,130
whereas exactly what, probably
our probabilities of a,
of electron transitions.

390
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:47,710
He said, that's fine. Heisenberg, and
at one point was so excited. Einstein,

391
00:20:47,711 --> 00:20:52,180
he went up, he visited him in Berlin and
said, Professor Einstein, um, I, I was so,

392
00:20:52,181 --> 00:20:56,080
I loved the way you just
used observational evidence
without trying to wonder

393
00:20:56,081 --> 00:20:58,330
what was happening backstage
when you came up with relativity.

394
00:20:58,510 --> 00:21:01,640
That's what I did in quantum mechanics.
Thank you. Einstein looked at them.

395
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:05,590
It's not what I meant at all. He said,
I didn't mean anything like that. Uh,

396
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:08,780
he thought that it was just provisional.
If you didn't know the details, uh,

397
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:11,380
eventually the details
would be clear and exact.

398
00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:15,250
So Einstein couldn't accept quantum
mechanics and it's evidence came in and

399
00:21:15,251 --> 00:21:19,720
there I became more and more evidence. He
just, he wouldn't, he wouldn't accept it.

400
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:23,530
Now it turns out he couldn't do it.
Some individuals,

401
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:27,850
so he was stuck up here. This had
worked really, really well. Voom,

402
00:21:27,851 --> 00:21:30,970
applying for this, applying for
that. Why should you ever change it?

403
00:21:30,971 --> 00:21:33,700
This is wonderful. There's something
here that it didn't apply to.

404
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:35,560
Well that was temporary member.

405
00:21:35,561 --> 00:21:39,850
He had been burned once with the expensive
of the universe is maybe he would

406
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:43,720
again, imagine you're pushing a
product and you pull back on a to suit.

407
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:46,710
A competitor does it and it works
perfectly well. He's, I knew it.

408
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:47,680
I should've just waited.

409
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:50,470
I have to ignore everybody's
comments against it and stuff.

410
00:21:50,650 --> 00:21:53,260
There's times to really stick to
your guns. Same thing in math.

411
00:21:53,261 --> 00:21:55,210
Same thing in physics.
You're working on a certain approach.

412
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:58,240
You don't get the right answer right away.
Oh, I'm nervous. I have to jump back.

413
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:02,260
Now. Sometimes you have to stick. The
question is how long, how long? Um, uh,

414
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:05,200
some people think that, well,
Einstein faded in his forties,

415
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:09,190
because in your forties, your brain isn't
as nimble as it it was at other times.

416
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:10,293
Those of us,

417
00:22:10,570 --> 00:22:15,160
those of you who are anxious about not
being up to the Shaundra level at 19 or

418
00:22:15,170 --> 00:22:19,000
Einstein of 26, um, can re,
uh, remember if you're really,

419
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:23,080
really quick mental arithmetic that
tends to peak just before age 11.

420
00:22:23,290 --> 00:22:27,280
And if you're good at picking up languages
to get a perfect accent is almost

421
00:22:27,281 --> 00:22:30,550
impossible. After the late teens, early
twenties, something changes in the brain,

422
00:22:30,670 --> 00:22:33,310
you can become fluent, very fluent
in language with a perfect accent,

423
00:22:33,430 --> 00:22:36,760
just gets harder. Um, so the
question is this physical like that.

424
00:22:36,761 --> 00:22:39,310
And the answer curiously is no.
Shandra say car,

425
00:22:39,311 --> 00:22:42,700
that person that I mentioned one day
and I think in, in the early 1980s,

426
00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:46,310
his wife elbowed him in the ribs in
Chicago. She told me this later, um,

427
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:49,450
and she said, Shondra wake up, it's a
Swedish Academy. You have the Nobel prize.

428
00:22:49,630 --> 00:22:53,620
And he said, without any arrogance,
he said, oh, for what's discovery?

429
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:58,150
He had about six or seven that were
worthy of the Nobel. Um, so, and he was,

430
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:01,880
he was doing great work into his sixties,
even into a seven days,

431
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:04,720
a rally in the 18 hundreds to that.
So there's a number of people to do it.

432
00:23:04,930 --> 00:23:05,711
And in particular,

433
00:23:05,711 --> 00:23:09,660
Einstein's best friend for awhile was
Nell's board and those board, the, uh,

434
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:12,910
the great, uh, Danish astronomer
who apparently, uh, sorry,

435
00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:17,200
a physicist who apparently had one,
a language which was called bad English.

436
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:19,150
He could speak bad English
with every accident.

437
00:23:19,151 --> 00:23:21,730
He could speak with a Danish accent.
He could speak with a French accent.

438
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:25,630
Wherever he went, people found it. I
can't quite get what you say like that.

439
00:23:25,631 --> 00:23:28,840
He would mumble. He was a
wonderful man. And in his sixties,

440
00:23:28,841 --> 00:23:31,120
even in his seventies at his
institute and Copenhagen,

441
00:23:31,390 --> 00:23:34,720
Bright Young Grad students from around
the world wanting to work with them. Um,

442
00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:38,650
Einstein's famous for selling, saying
God does not play dice with the guys.

443
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:42,190
A guy does not play dice with the
universe. Nell's, Boris said to him once,

444
00:23:42,191 --> 00:23:44,980
Niels Bohr had accepted the
evidence from quantum mechanics.

445
00:23:45,170 --> 00:23:48,200
Once Niels Bohr had looked down at
these new things, these quantum results,

446
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:52,580
Nelsworth said to him, Einstein, stop
telling God what to do. You know,

447
00:23:52,581 --> 00:23:54,200
looking at the universe,
stop telling them.

448
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:57,590
So Nell's Bohr had actually moved
over here. This is g equals t,

449
00:23:57,591 --> 00:24:00,260
but more importantly, it's the notion
that everything should be exact.

450
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:01,700
I'll call it a little right angle.

451
00:24:01,701 --> 00:24:03,980
Everything should be exact
Nell's Bora window over here.

452
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:06,320
And he had to just slightly
different abstract principle,

453
00:24:06,410 --> 00:24:09,500
which accepted the principles behind
quantum mechanics that this going to be a

454
00:24:09,501 --> 00:24:13,700
certain fundamental probability as
far as you go down to the universe.

455
00:24:13,850 --> 00:24:16,850
It isn't exact. There's going to
be probability and uncertainty.

456
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:19,260
It isn't terrible.
Things are customed unlimited.

457
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:21,170
So things as they come to
the macro level are fine.

458
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:24,500
We can make transistors work very,
very well. But within transistors,

459
00:24:24,501 --> 00:24:27,620
these quantum effects are taking place.
That's what happens.

460
00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:32,120
So Nell's bore had actually managed to
move over here and from here he come with

461
00:24:32,121 --> 00:24:35,030
various clues. So imagine this is
something that doesn't apply there,

462
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:38,780
but Nell's fourth thing, it applies
very, very well. So he had that,

463
00:24:38,781 --> 00:24:42,200
he was able to move their Einstein
couldn't, uh, the Cavendish lab,

464
00:24:42,210 --> 00:24:45,290
remember I told you the Calvinists
lab fell apart for 20 years.

465
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,900
Find out what's inside the ad
and was a perfect guiding light.

466
00:24:47,901 --> 00:24:50,300
It's the sort of thing, a
nuke. If you've ever been, uh,

467
00:24:50,330 --> 00:24:53,330
watching a video at home and somebody
comes in and say, well, what's going on?

468
00:24:53,331 --> 00:24:56,090
And you give him a little,
you whisper summer or if it's,

469
00:24:56,091 --> 00:25:00,710
if it's 24 saying Jack Bowers almost
about to get the person and the rug is

470
00:25:00,711 --> 00:25:03,140
going to be pulled out from under him
and he'll have to get the person in a

471
00:25:03,141 --> 00:25:05,870
different way that can apply
to any 24 episode ever.

472
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:09,320
But often you go into a movie and
people will whisper what's going on.

473
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:13,640
The great thing about these mid level
abstractions is you can whisper to

474
00:25:13,641 --> 00:25:16,880
somebody and they get all the knowledge
of the people have already done the hard

475
00:25:16,881 --> 00:25:20,360
work. How cool is that? Um, I can
whisper to the rules of calculus.

476
00:25:20,361 --> 00:25:23,570
You're smarter than Newton. I can
whisper even in a simple book like this,

477
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:26,240
a bit of general relativity,
your past, what I would,

478
00:25:26,241 --> 00:25:29,340
Albert Einstein himself did in his
thirties. It's really awesome. Uh,

479
00:25:29,341 --> 00:25:32,150
the Cavendish lab, they whisper to
people who are really bright and physics.

480
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:33,590
Let's look what's inside the atom.

481
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:37,340
And immediately they have a good
research proposal. Einstein. Yes. So,

482
00:25:37,341 --> 00:25:39,260
so that's what they did.
But that faded after while,

483
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:43,070
and then about 15 years later, somebody
else took over. The Cavendish and said,

484
00:25:43,490 --> 00:25:46,550
you know, what would be a really
good middle up mid level abstraction?

485
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:50,980
Let's use x-ray's to study crystals.
How about crystals are proteins. Yeah,

486
00:25:51,290 --> 00:25:55,100
let's use x rays to study protein
crystals. That was fabulous.

487
00:25:55,101 --> 00:25:58,100
That's how DNA was discovered, right?
It, it crystallizes beautifully.

488
00:25:58,101 --> 00:25:59,120
And the Xray to fractions,

489
00:25:59,121 --> 00:26:02,360
you can work backwards to find the
double helix structure. Hemoglobin.

490
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:07,160
It was magnificent and they started out
boom with another burst of Nobel prizes,

491
00:26:07,161 --> 00:26:11,540
one after another for about 20
years. Um, what happened next?

492
00:26:11,541 --> 00:26:15,920
You will have to uh, read elsewhere
so when can do it. So, um, anyway,

493
00:26:15,921 --> 00:26:18,950
so I said we would give the examples
of science and then go back to business

494
00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:22,460
about which I'm profoundly not an expert.
Thus we can have a discussion on that.

495
00:26:22,610 --> 00:26:25,220
Or later we can have a discussion
about the curios about Einstein.

496
00:26:25,370 --> 00:26:28,910
You can ask me about his blue parakeet.
Um, but I won't tell you about that now.

497
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:32,810
Um, so this diagram, which Einstein was
so proud of and I saw you the picture of,

498
00:26:32,990 --> 00:26:35,120
suppose you change it a little bit.

499
00:26:35,330 --> 00:26:39,170
So down here instead of like an expanding
universe, which is noticed or um, uh,

500
00:26:39,171 --> 00:26:39,950
mercury,

501
00:26:39,950 --> 00:26:44,520
which is noticed you have things like
something like there's a big internet,

502
00:26:44,790 --> 00:26:46,770
right?
And then you go up there and say,

503
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:49,830
what's going to be a really good
way to deal with a big internet?

504
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:53,190
There were companies like a Yahoo
and stuff that dealt with, I dunno,

505
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:56,490
they dealt with it in one way.
What if you have the notion up here,

506
00:26:56,520 --> 00:27:00,090
not gene equals t you're not doing tensors
in general relativity, but just say,

507
00:27:00,091 --> 00:27:05,091
I know a really good search system
plus maybe ads to monetize it.

508
00:27:05,970 --> 00:27:07,590
That's going to be a
good way to deal with it.

509
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:10,080
So these things down here at big internet,
wow,

510
00:27:10,290 --> 00:27:13,050
it applies to it really well and there's
all sorts of other things that applies

511
00:27:13,051 --> 00:27:15,930
to it really, really well. Certain
companies come to mind that were very,

512
00:27:15,931 --> 00:27:19,500
very good at that. Um, so isn't that
neat? So that same logical form,

513
00:27:19,501 --> 00:27:21,960
there's data down there,
there's stuff in the real world.

514
00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:23,760
You make a jump of abstraction,

515
00:27:23,761 --> 00:27:26,970
which isn't going to come from anybody
telling you you have to be exceptional.

516
00:27:26,971 --> 00:27:31,530
Like Rutherford at the cabin dish lab
like Einstein in 1916 to come up to it.

517
00:27:31,710 --> 00:27:35,490
And once you're up into it, also
ordinary people, ordinary skill people,

518
00:27:35,670 --> 00:27:37,800
you put them in that chair
and they can do good stuff.

519
00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:40,260
Captain Kirk is sitting
inside a wonderful chair.

520
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:44,030
He could not create the
starship enterprise, any of
us sitting in that chair, uh,

521
00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:46,470
including Justin Long from a galaxy quest,

522
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:50,010
we'll be able to press buttons and shoot
phase and just all sorts of cool stuff.

523
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:53,550
If you're in the right perch and position,
you have magnificent power, right?

524
00:27:53,730 --> 00:27:57,600
People can come into a company like
this and when this matches that,

525
00:27:57,750 --> 00:27:59,480
they don't have to be the terrific,
uh,

526
00:27:59,490 --> 00:28:01,530
entrepreneurs are geniuses
who come up with this.

527
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:06,030
They just walk right in there and now
Nell's Bora was able to walk across from

528
00:28:06,031 --> 00:28:10,830
this to that. He was a very flexible
man. The thing is, not everybody does.

529
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:14,880
Um, so what happens? So this worked
really well. So will a company like this,

530
00:28:14,881 --> 00:28:18,750
and again, this is purely
speculative, will a company
like this last forever? Well,

531
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:21,000
there's lots of new stuff
coming on down here.

532
00:28:21,210 --> 00:28:24,720
So apps can be sometimes hard to search,
they can be like a walled garden.

533
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:26,580
There's concerns with privacy.
There's,

534
00:28:26,730 --> 00:28:29,240
there's all sorts of stuff
like that going on. Um, uh,

535
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:31,890
there's notions of how do you discover
things that haven't already been

536
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:34,290
categorized in some way.
Just lots of new stuff.

537
00:28:34,530 --> 00:28:38,190
And then there's even stranger things
happening when this company here was

538
00:28:38,191 --> 00:28:40,650
formed,
hipsters in shortage didn't exist.

539
00:28:40,651 --> 00:28:44,130
Shortage was a terrible slum of Brooklyn
was a place where people went if they

540
00:28:44,131 --> 00:28:46,070
got divorced and didn't have any money.
Um,

541
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:48,540
so there's people with a
slightly different culture,

542
00:28:48,690 --> 00:28:52,140
maybe people who don't like to own cars.
It's no longer cool tone cards.

543
00:28:52,141 --> 00:28:55,560
It isn't part of your definition of
better definition could be, I don't know,

544
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:57,030
having real life experiences,

545
00:28:57,031 --> 00:29:00,450
live music or genuine fitness or
triatholon something like that.

546
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:04,620
So new categories or are coming
up apps, blah, blah, blah.

547
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:07,530
Very occasionally people from
here can change themselves,

548
00:29:07,710 --> 00:29:08,850
but it usually doesn't work.

549
00:29:08,851 --> 00:29:12,180
Remember the Cavendish lab had to
jump over to a different view. Uh,

550
00:29:12,330 --> 00:29:16,140
they couldn't modify looking what's
inside the atom to going there.

551
00:29:16,141 --> 00:29:19,740
They had to have new people came
in rather for died. Max Planck,

552
00:29:19,741 --> 00:29:23,700
the great physicist once said, you never
argue your opponents, you outlive them.

553
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:26,370
And that's something, um,
so that went over there.

554
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:29,310
Occasionally a person can make
that move across and move sideways.

555
00:29:29,490 --> 00:29:33,750
So think of again to the extent if search
is going to have limits with some of

556
00:29:33,751 --> 00:29:36,300
these other things over here,
new data bits on here.

557
00:29:36,510 --> 00:29:39,840
Suppose you have something else.
Alphabet, lots of things over here,

558
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:43,390
quite different.
So there's a big structure like that.

559
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:46,840
And then from there you can maybe
apply to these things better. Um,

560
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:49,540
you can apply to those and maybe who
knows? Fresh things will come up.

561
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:53,770
We don't know.
Now the question is who fills those slots?

562
00:29:53,950 --> 00:29:54,940
Who Fill those slots?

563
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:59,380
Einstein went to one slide up here
and he could not move across Nell's.

564
00:29:59,381 --> 00:30:02,200
Boris had come come out.
And it's different from what
you've learned. Come on. Yes,

565
00:30:02,201 --> 00:30:04,030
you were really bright at
university doing this. Yes,

566
00:30:04,031 --> 00:30:07,300
you were terrific coming up with these
tools and these tensors come over here

567
00:30:07,301 --> 00:30:11,320
and use this new stuff. You will come
up with great things. And the sadness,

568
00:30:11,321 --> 00:30:16,300
the pathos is that Einstein's mind was up
to it. Uh, as an older man, he said, hmm.

569
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:19,330
One implication of this quantum mechanics,
if it were to be true,

570
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:21,850
is quantum entanglement.
That's almost impossible.

571
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,980
His mathematics was exactly right.
This is in 1935, almost a century.

572
00:30:27,210 --> 00:30:28,780
We're actually a century after that.

573
00:30:28,781 --> 00:30:31,630
I think we'll have quite nice
quantum computers, a bit specialized,

574
00:30:31,631 --> 00:30:33,760
but doing well,
he came up with gravitational lensing.

575
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:36,940
All of this is as an old man.
His brain was terrific,

576
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,900
but he just ventured there
briefly go right back. I
gotta do it this old way. Um,

577
00:30:40,901 --> 00:30:42,910
so very rarely come when move across.

578
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,370
Sometimes you have to
acquire brand new people.

579
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:48,540
That's why many companies do
well. They have, um, uh, you know,

580
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:51,730
entire new groups either spinoff
or bright in or something.

581
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,960
I Kasan however magnificent people like
bore and what go up and work across

582
00:30:55,961 --> 00:30:58,600
themselves and steps step by
step into these different things,

583
00:30:58,810 --> 00:31:02,020
which will have those fresh implications.
So I leave you with a question.

584
00:31:02,050 --> 00:31:05,590
Are we Nell's bore or are we Albert
Einstein? And after reading this book,

585
00:31:05,591 --> 00:31:08,080
you'll think, gosh, I used to
think I signed was terrific.

586
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:11,470
But now I don't want to be
like him at all. Thank you.

587
00:31:16,570 --> 00:31:17,403
Okay.

588
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:21,500
Thank you very much. Oh, we have
time for questions. So please, uh,

589
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:22,830
please wait a whole microphone.

590
00:31:28,650 --> 00:31:31,770
So Einstein created
shredding is Captain T. Yes.

591
00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:36,480
So that was basically saying
quantum physics is meticulous way.

592
00:31:38,130 --> 00:31:42,960
Uh, the, uh, uh, uh, I don't want
to ask hands up of people who,

593
00:31:42,961 --> 00:31:45,420
um, who know, who don't know about
Troy niches. Cat. So I'll get,

594
00:31:45,421 --> 00:31:47,220
I'll give a background.
One thing,

595
00:31:47,221 --> 00:31:50,270
one conclusion I would say is
that if a man named Schrodinger,

596
00:31:50,290 --> 00:31:51,870
if you were transformed into a cat,

597
00:31:51,871 --> 00:31:53,120
like you stepped out of
the Internet and well,

598
00:31:53,130 --> 00:31:55,740
I'm a cat and stuff and there's these
strange people around and a man named

599
00:31:55,741 --> 00:31:58,800
shrines here comes up to you, smiling
says, would you like to come home with me?

600
00:31:59,010 --> 00:32:02,310
The answer is no. Under no
circumstances, it's not a good idea.

601
00:32:02,610 --> 00:32:05,730
Schreibman chair was a man that Einstein
really love because of his personal

602
00:32:05,731 --> 00:32:10,090
life. Uh, Shriners Harris' wife used to a
reward him when he had great results. Uh,

603
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:13,680
she would introduce him to a really nice
twins to go off to the mountain with

604
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:18,090
and stuff they said about Shriners here
when he came to a Oxford in the 1930s to

605
00:32:18,091 --> 00:32:22,200
arrive at Oxford with one wife is bad
enough to ride with two really accessive

606
00:32:22,290 --> 00:32:24,690
so it's right in your head.
This wild sort of Bohemian life,

607
00:32:24,691 --> 00:32:28,230
which Einstein like that's one reason
Einstein grew his hair like that when he

608
00:32:28,231 --> 00:32:28,621
was young,

609
00:32:28,621 --> 00:32:31,710
he was actually kind of dishy it was
a good looking guy when he was rowing

610
00:32:31,711 --> 00:32:33,060
people said, well, we're gonna do really,

611
00:32:33,061 --> 00:32:36,090
really muscly and stuff when
you bid a sale and Rowan stuff.

612
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:39,680
But later in bourgeois Berlin and the
1920s, he wanted to fight that to say,

613
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,780
you don't have to line up and be exact.

614
00:32:41,781 --> 00:32:45,230
Like that is his second wife was
incredibly particular Albert.

615
00:32:45,231 --> 00:32:47,990
I don't think that's quite the right way
to hold our forks, that sort of thing.

616
00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:51,260
So he did the hair is
still sort of a resistance.

617
00:32:51,530 --> 00:32:54,500
So he likes Schrodinger and the two
men were really good friends and they

618
00:32:54,501 --> 00:32:56,660
collaborated in the mid 1930s by letter.

619
00:32:57,020 --> 00:33:00,140
Schreibman juror had gotten a
job in a Dublin of all places.

620
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:02,540
It turns out the guy who ran Ireland,
other time,

621
00:33:02,541 --> 00:33:05,780
devil era and studied mathematics.
So he respected to write in Azure.

622
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:08,240
And in their correspondence
they came up with this notion.

623
00:33:08,630 --> 00:33:12,020
It turns out very often people come
up with a notion to disprove a theory.

624
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:16,430
And that notion is really good. And the
reason is we don't like humiliation.

625
00:33:16,431 --> 00:33:19,790
We don't like fear of friend of mine was
a very successful a TV and film writer

626
00:33:19,791 --> 00:33:22,460
and producer and he was really good.
Then when you got a lot of money,

627
00:33:22,461 --> 00:33:25,640
sort of lost his creativity and he tried
all sorts of ways to get his creativity

628
00:33:25,641 --> 00:33:28,250
back, tried working with bright
young people, going into museums,

629
00:33:28,251 --> 00:33:29,750
working in different fields
and none of it worked.

630
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:33,380
And then his business partner ripped
him off and boy was he motivated.

631
00:33:33,381 --> 00:33:35,000
He started writing terrific stuff.

632
00:33:35,030 --> 00:33:38,510
So Einstein couldn't still dislike the
fact that they've been pushed to the side.

633
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:41,930
So that brought up his creativity
to real high level. You know,

634
00:33:41,931 --> 00:33:45,380
if you're fired from a company, you
want to show them you're full of energy,

635
00:33:45,381 --> 00:33:46,214
you have to show him.

636
00:33:46,310 --> 00:33:49,230
So he came up with in correspondence
with steroid injuries during his year,

637
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:54,020
was involved a little bit, um, with this
notion of Heisenberg's cat that, uh, if,

638
00:33:54,170 --> 00:33:54,501
if I,

639
00:33:54,501 --> 00:33:57,860
if there's no way whatsoever to predict
if a certain particle splendid decay

640
00:33:57,861 --> 00:34:02,440
this way or decay that way, um, then the
following curious effect happens and us,

641
00:34:02,441 --> 00:34:02,840
sorry,

642
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:06,780
suppose you can't predict which way it's
going to go and you will only know it.

643
00:34:06,790 --> 00:34:10,340
It only will, you only know what we
would only happen once you look at it.

644
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:14,960
Suppose that particles inside a box,
suppose the poor cat is inside the box.

645
00:34:15,110 --> 00:34:18,470
Suppose a large gun,
you see the viciousness of quiet,

646
00:34:18,471 --> 00:34:22,970
often vegetarian physicists. They like,
should the gun have impaling hooks?

647
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:25,940
You know, should there be a little
trap door underneath it and stuff.

648
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:29,150
And suppose if the particle decays
and goes this way, nothing happens.

649
00:34:29,151 --> 00:34:32,720
The catwalks around that. And I that if
the particle decays and goes that way,

650
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:36,230
a big gun, bless it to
smithereens, right? Um,

651
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:40,820
in a, a standard interpretation
of quantum mechanics.

652
00:34:41,210 --> 00:34:44,180
It not only do you not only
know until you open the box,

653
00:34:44,181 --> 00:34:46,700
which way the particles decayed.
It hasn't,

654
00:34:47,330 --> 00:34:52,220
you can't a Saturday say it hasn't
happened. Um, it's ambiguous until,

655
00:34:52,221 --> 00:34:55,760
uh, until you opened it and looked at
the actually observation helps create it.

656
00:34:56,030 --> 00:34:59,390
Einstein thought that was insane,
but yet a lot of evidence, uh, again,

657
00:34:59,391 --> 00:35:02,870
I'm being a metaphorical about it. A lot
of evidence backed it up. The question,

658
00:35:02,871 --> 00:35:04,970
of course, is Einstein
said, well, in that case,

659
00:35:05,150 --> 00:35:07,820
is the cat alive or dead
before you open the box? Right?

660
00:35:07,970 --> 00:35:11,240
We don't know which way the particle went
and if the trigger was pulled or not.

661
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:14,360
So the cat alive or dead and clearly
it can't be in a super position of two

662
00:35:14,361 --> 00:35:17,240
states, half dead and half
alive. On the other hand,

663
00:35:17,241 --> 00:35:20,540
if any of you have ever taken the
northern line in London at about 8:00 AM,

664
00:35:20,570 --> 00:35:23,990
you understand many people can be
in that superposition of two states,

665
00:35:24,110 --> 00:35:27,230
half dead and half alive.
So that was a story.

666
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:30,350
And they came up with that notion to
sort of disprove quantum mechanics.

667
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:33,500
And people like Nell's board, other
bright young people working with him.

668
00:35:33,501 --> 00:35:35,960
Thought good point. Good point. Yup.

669
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:39,420
There's a superposition of states until
the observation takes place and that has

670
00:35:39,421 --> 00:35:41,220
certain consequences.
And Lo and behold,

671
00:35:41,370 --> 00:35:44,700
those consequences were used by John
Bardeen who was working at a Princeton at

672
00:35:44,701 --> 00:35:48,060
the time to develop it. True trends
transistor. It's actually true.

673
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:49,290
How curious is that?

674
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:54,150
Einstein wouldn't step sideways to accept
it because he had been so comfortable

675
00:35:54,151 --> 00:35:58,940
in their previous position. I have
a, a little addendum to the answer,

676
00:35:58,941 --> 00:36:01,470
but I'm going to stop giving really long
answers. If there's time I'll give it,

677
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:05,270
just remind me about the, of the
playing card problem. Uh, and uh, but I,

678
00:36:05,271 --> 00:36:06,620
I'd like to have some
more questions first.

679
00:36:14,570 --> 00:36:15,403
Yeah.

680
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:28,793
Yeah.

681
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:38,200
So the question is how much of it was
maybe not necessarily religious but just

682
00:36:38,201 --> 00:36:41,620
came from simple aesthetics, beauty rather
than rather than ugliness and crude?

683
00:36:41,621 --> 00:36:44,860
This, the answer is a real
lot. Uh, the, the ads,

684
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:49,270
the to the two possibilities are related.
Einstein believed in the, uh, um,

685
00:36:49,870 --> 00:36:53,440
the need for architectural simplicity
a little bit because of his religious

686
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:57,640
views. Uh, Einstein was once interviewed
what he felt about music and he was like,

687
00:36:57,670 --> 00:37:00,960
he was like the guy, you the bless, you
can never please. People said Mendelssohn.

688
00:37:00,961 --> 00:37:03,280
What do you think? What Mendelssohn?
Mendelssohn is wonderful.

689
00:37:03,281 --> 00:37:07,660
The beautiful lyric tunes,
but he lacks a certain architectural.

690
00:37:07,710 --> 00:37:11,370
A whole, what about Shuma? Oh,
Schumacher. I really feel for Schuman,

691
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:15,820
but it's not incredibly pure and
great. What about Beethoven? Beethoven,

692
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,690
Beethoven, Beethoven. It's terrific.
It's emotional. It's powerful,

693
00:37:20,170 --> 00:37:22,240
but it's a little bit arbitrary.
I thoughts, emotions. Howard,

694
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:24,640
the one he loved wasn't even back.

695
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:28,840
He loved Mozart because Mozart is not
just the surprise that the thing with

696
00:37:28,841 --> 00:37:33,100
Mozart is what comes next is unexpected
but plausible. How cool is that?

697
00:37:33,130 --> 00:37:35,800
Unexpected but plausible that that's
what's happening. It's like a really,

698
00:37:35,801 --> 00:37:39,430
really good a thriller,
but often it felt true.

699
00:37:39,431 --> 00:37:41,590
It wasn't just a little game.
It felt,

700
00:37:41,890 --> 00:37:45,820
you feel that a little barrier has been
removed and you're seeing truths of the

701
00:37:45,821 --> 00:37:49,210
universe and bits of Mozart, at least
for Einstein and sometimes for me.

702
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:52,550
Can I just say as a footnote,
Mozart's clarinet concerto with,

703
00:37:52,630 --> 00:37:56,020
I once listened to when I was in the
south of France and had two recordings for

704
00:37:56,021 --> 00:37:58,480
about a week.
I can never hear that again in my life.

705
00:37:58,481 --> 00:38:01,090
People tell me it's beautiful,
but please don't play it in my presence.

706
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:03,310
But as for the aesthetics,
that would be it.

707
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:06,160
And when Einstein was dissatisfied
and unhappy when he was young,

708
00:38:06,161 --> 00:38:08,830
he played the violin and played
really well. But when it was older,

709
00:38:08,831 --> 00:38:10,360
his fingers got a little bit arthritic.

710
00:38:10,540 --> 00:38:12,520
And what he loved was just
noodling away on the piano.

711
00:38:12,521 --> 00:38:16,120
He would noodle for hours and hours
and hours and Berlin and Princeton,

712
00:38:16,121 --> 00:38:19,630
a little bit of Jazz, a little bit of
classical jazz, of all sorts of stuff. Um,

713
00:38:20,710 --> 00:38:23,800
aesthetics meant everything to him because
he felt they were a sign of something

714
00:38:23,801 --> 00:38:24,820
very,
very true.

715
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:27,033
And

716
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:30,940
it drove him into isolation.
How sad is that

717
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:33,013
next?

718
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:45,790
So, um, I'm things, um, mistakes,

719
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:50,640
which one would you say would be
one would be his greatest mistake?

720
00:38:50,650 --> 00:38:55,110
We could have prevented a conference
meeting more than of that.

721
00:38:56,230 --> 00:38:59,230
Great question. So out of all the
mistakes, what was, what was the key,

722
00:38:59,231 --> 00:39:00,160
what was the worst,

723
00:39:00,161 --> 00:39:04,000
the most fundamental mistake and many
people think the mistake was modifying the

724
00:39:04,001 --> 00:39:05,950
g equals t equation. Again, that's,

725
00:39:05,951 --> 00:39:09,520
that's just a metaphor modifying and
adding extra terms. But that was,

726
00:39:09,521 --> 00:39:12,700
that was a mistake. But it's mistake that
anybody can make and then fix it. Oh,

727
00:39:12,701 --> 00:39:13,534
actually I was wrong.

728
00:39:13,630 --> 00:39:17,020
And you go back with the same attitude
that it had when he was young that you

729
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:18,790
would climb up here,
which is beautiful.

730
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:21,130
But then you would check things
against the consequences.

731
00:39:21,250 --> 00:39:23,320
And if ugly facts really got in the way,

732
00:39:23,530 --> 00:39:26,260
you would have to change this
however beautiful it was going up.

733
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:29,670
So I think his mistake wasn't the
scientific mistake about the lambda.

734
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:33,970
The extra term anybody could have
done that. The mistake was, was was,

735
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:38,330
was diving in and saying it
was a psychological mistake.
I've been burned once.

736
00:39:38,331 --> 00:39:41,700
I'm never going to be burned
again. Right. Tony Blair had a,

737
00:39:41,701 --> 00:39:45,400
a possibility early in his
tenure as prime minister to, uh,

738
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:49,900
help NATO forces go into a Costco. And
a lot of people said, don't do that.

739
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:52,810
It's imperialism, it's not going to
work. It's really messy on the ground.

740
00:39:53,050 --> 00:39:57,280
He ignored them. He went into Costco and
on the whole it worked quite well. Um,

741
00:39:57,460 --> 00:40:02,200
a few years later, he wanted to go into
Iraq. People said, don't go into Iraq.

742
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:04,930
You're going to mess things up.
You're taking, it's a hornet's nest.

743
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:09,880
Everything will get worse.
And he said, Ma, they said
that before. And I was right.

744
00:40:10,030 --> 00:40:12,310
I stuck to my guns. I'm going to
stick to my guns gun. And in fact,

745
00:40:12,311 --> 00:40:15,970
he was wrong the second time. So that was
Einstein's problem. The second mistake.

746
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:19,450
Now it happens a lot to people who are
at the top level because they were so

747
00:40:19,451 --> 00:40:20,470
successful before.

748
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:24,430
If I have like a plausible hypothesis
and then it's proven wrong,

749
00:40:24,490 --> 00:40:27,670
and then it's later proven right, that's
nice. But it's just a plus by hypothesis.

750
00:40:27,790 --> 00:40:32,440
But if I come up with general relativity,
wow. And that's finally, you know,

751
00:40:32,441 --> 00:40:36,730
proven right? Again, I'm really not cocky,
but I'm very confident in my beliefs.

752
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:39,190
I feel, even if I don't feel
I'm speaking for myself,

753
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:41,890
I feel I've been able to find
something true about the universe.

754
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:45,040
The people who hustled really,
really hard to get to the, uh,

755
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:48,610
to get to the top usually have one stick,
one special approach that really,

756
00:40:48,611 --> 00:40:51,820
really works. Um, and they
have to push hard to get it.

757
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,150
And it's often a magical approach.
It almost never happens twice.

758
00:40:55,270 --> 00:40:56,310
A Lester Thoreau,
the,

759
00:40:56,311 --> 00:41:00,130
the guy at MIT who clearly has been
described as less than thorough,

760
00:41:00,131 --> 00:41:05,080
which is mean pointed out that hardly
anybody who creates a company creates two

761
00:41:05,081 --> 00:41:09,310
different companies ever. Occasionally
there's people to do it at that idea.

762
00:41:09,311 --> 00:41:11,830
Unfortunately,
I came to me as a teenager,

763
00:41:11,831 --> 00:41:15,610
I read his book and it bothered me
so much that the first time I had a

764
00:41:15,611 --> 00:41:18,010
bestseller, I thought, yeah, well,

765
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:23,190
but I had a second one 10 years later and
I said, yes, Lester. Yes, we can do it.

766
00:41:23,210 --> 00:41:26,110
We can do a separate thing. First
time could be luck. Second time. Okay,

767
00:41:26,170 --> 00:41:27,340
when knows how to do this stuff.

768
00:41:32,830 --> 00:41:36,160
Einstein specifically that you've not
only write a whole book about them,

769
00:41:36,161 --> 00:41:37,250
but wrote a second book.

770
00:41:40,010 --> 00:41:44,920
I'm amazed. I'm amazed at what human
beings could do. Um, and also, uh,

771
00:41:46,190 --> 00:41:47,360
ordinary human beings.

772
00:41:47,390 --> 00:41:51,230
I grew up in a ordinary Jewish
family in Chicago after World War II,

773
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:54,230
and many people in the neighborhood
would have a picture of Einstein up on

774
00:41:54,231 --> 00:41:57,800
refrigerator or an encyclopedia about
when they're thinking of Einstein.

775
00:41:58,070 --> 00:42:02,090
And I thought, this is a noble and good
man. I feel some connection with him,

776
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:06,200
but I had no idea what he did. I had
no idea. Some people, some people,

777
00:42:06,201 --> 00:42:09,410
I don't know if they invent a computer
or they invent a car or a particular

778
00:42:09,411 --> 00:42:12,980
device or an airplane, it's beautiful.
But when I was a little child,

779
00:42:13,010 --> 00:42:16,340
I didn't know what Einstein Hinton at
university. I learned about it and I was,

780
00:42:16,580 --> 00:42:19,850
I was amazed. It was sort of like
listening to Mozart for the first time,

781
00:42:19,851 --> 00:42:23,150
or in my case, Mozart,
especially the clarinet concerto,

782
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:27,830
but like good blues or
something. You listen to it
and feels this is really true.

783
00:42:27,910 --> 00:42:29,990
Sort of like on a really good date.
On a mediocre date,

784
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:32,420
you tell you you're cute stories,
they tilt their cute stories,

785
00:42:32,510 --> 00:42:34,860
but on a really good date,
you're just connected there.

786
00:42:34,870 --> 00:42:38,000
You're just directly connected. There's
no artifice from top to bottom and stuff.

787
00:42:38,150 --> 00:42:39,860
So when I was learning about
Einstein, I thought, wow,

788
00:42:39,861 --> 00:42:42,080
he cuts through in the university.
So what's really there?

789
00:42:42,230 --> 00:42:46,890
This notion of geometry inducing,
the sensation of force, uh,

790
00:42:46,910 --> 00:42:47,541
as with,
you know,

791
00:42:47,541 --> 00:42:50,120
people going to the North Pole and
feeling they're pulled together or with

792
00:42:50,121 --> 00:42:52,220
gravity coming their way.
That's incredible.

793
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:55,460
So I really wanted to share it and they
didn't want it to find out how did he do

794
00:42:55,461 --> 00:42:58,460
it? I mean, what sort of man
was he? What was his background?

795
00:42:58,610 --> 00:43:02,570
One thing that helps in as an a
background like that is to be not a total

796
00:43:02,571 --> 00:43:05,090
outsider. If you're a total outsider,
you don't have enough education,

797
00:43:05,270 --> 00:43:08,870
but not to be a total insight or either.
It helps to be sort of on the edge.

798
00:43:09,050 --> 00:43:12,800
Moderate discrimination works really,
really well in a science and in business,

799
00:43:12,801 --> 00:43:15,380
very much several discrimination.
They don't give you a chance.

800
00:43:15,530 --> 00:43:17,660
Monitor discrimination,
you know, two things. Hey,

801
00:43:17,661 --> 00:43:20,000
you have to work a little bit harder.
And B,

802
00:43:20,150 --> 00:43:23,420
what you've learned before about
the system isn't necessarily true.

803
00:43:23,540 --> 00:43:27,020
Suppose somebody grows up, uh,
saying an extremely religious,

804
00:43:27,021 --> 00:43:29,810
a fundamentalist religious view.
As a kid,

805
00:43:29,990 --> 00:43:32,930
they're taught to say that the world is
based on turtles and it's turtles all

806
00:43:32,931 --> 00:43:36,680
the way down. They go to university and
the people there who teach astronomy say,

807
00:43:36,890 --> 00:43:38,840
that's nonsense.
It's not like that at all.

808
00:43:38,930 --> 00:43:41,110
Here I'm going to teach you
the later latest results.

809
00:43:41,130 --> 00:43:45,380
This is what we know is totally true. The
person might think maybe, but maybe not.

810
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:48,650
Well, my mother taught me was, was
wrong. Maybe what I learned from you,

811
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:51,530
maybe that not necessarily as
wrong as that previous thing,

812
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:54,320
but I'll be a little bit cynical.
Compare that to somebody who was, hey,

813
00:43:54,321 --> 00:43:57,200
a professor's kid. They grew up
learning the latest results. You know,

814
00:43:57,230 --> 00:44:00,770
on a simplified version of these nice
books you buy for your kids when you feel

815
00:44:00,771 --> 00:44:04,960
guilty and you're watching Jack Bauer
saved the day again, um, or, um,

816
00:44:04,970 --> 00:44:07,130
and then when they go to university
and it's more of the same,

817
00:44:07,250 --> 00:44:09,530
they have no reason to be really,
really critical.

818
00:44:10,010 --> 00:44:12,350
So Einstein was enough of
an outsider to be critical,

819
00:44:12,470 --> 00:44:16,550
but not so much that he was,
um, uh, that he had no training.

820
00:44:19,660 --> 00:44:20,493
Right.

821
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:30,860
Hold on to this skepticism about when I,

822
00:44:31,140 --> 00:44:35,190
I'm assuming the experimental
results like experiments. Yeah.

823
00:44:35,850 --> 00:44:39,030
So how did he hold onto
a skepticism when one,

824
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:42,880
I suppose he held up to it?
Well, a couple of reasons. One,

825
00:44:42,881 --> 00:44:45,430
he had seen that large groups
of people can be wrong.

826
00:44:45,730 --> 00:44:47,980
All the astronomers in the world,
everybody,

827
00:44:48,550 --> 00:44:52,090
whether they were very theoretical,
are very practical.

828
00:44:52,180 --> 00:44:56,410
They all were persuaded that the universe
was static for 10 years or eight years

829
00:44:56,411 --> 00:44:59,500
and stuff. And it's like, Ooh, they
had been wrong. They'd been rung once.

830
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:02,080
What if they had been wrong for 20 or
30 years? They were certain results.

831
00:45:02,290 --> 00:45:04,270
The ability to measure
things in the university.

832
00:45:04,290 --> 00:45:07,630
It was very difficult to measure.
Absolute distances is hard.

833
00:45:07,970 --> 00:45:12,580
We know that if we know the absolute
brightness of a car headlight at a certain

834
00:45:12,581 --> 00:45:14,910
distance,
what we perceive of it is,

835
00:45:15,150 --> 00:45:19,570
is going to be high or low and then the
intensity and then we can work out from

836
00:45:19,571 --> 00:45:21,940
its absolute magnitude,
uh, how far away it is.

837
00:45:22,090 --> 00:45:24,390
So it took a long time until astronomers,

838
00:45:24,391 --> 00:45:27,490
it was a woman named Henrietta
[inaudible] in Boston who found out,

839
00:45:27,491 --> 00:45:28,324
who found out,

840
00:45:28,630 --> 00:45:32,710
who managed to find a way of measuring
the distance to the nearest I galaxies.

841
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:36,970
And, uh, that allowed us to get a proper,
a proper yardstick for the universe.

842
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:41,420
So suppose Henry had 11 hadn't done
that. 50 years may have passed. Einstein.

843
00:45:41,590 --> 00:45:43,750
Einstein knew he was lucky.
It only was 10 years.

844
00:45:43,930 --> 00:45:47,830
So it could have been past his death
passed his whole lifetime that people

845
00:45:47,831 --> 00:45:50,560
thought the universe was static. And Lo
and behold, it was not static, you know,

846
00:45:50,561 --> 00:45:53,440
the greatest authorities. So that
was one. The other thing is, uh,

847
00:45:53,620 --> 00:45:54,970
in the 1920s and thirties,

848
00:45:54,971 --> 00:45:59,480
he saw an entire country's go mad as
countries go mad and nuts at, uh, uh,

849
00:45:59,780 --> 00:46:03,400
in 1933, uh, uh, many books were
burned in Germany, in public,

850
00:46:03,580 --> 00:46:07,690
including in the greatest university
town everywhere in the world.

851
00:46:07,691 --> 00:46:09,790
Then it was Kirsten again. It'd
be like, could you imagine if it,

852
00:46:09,970 --> 00:46:13,150
if it Cambridge and MIT
and all those places,

853
00:46:13,420 --> 00:46:17,320
they start burning books with enthusiasm
from the students and Einstein's books

854
00:46:17,321 --> 00:46:20,530
for some of those that was there were
burned. It was non area and physics.

855
00:46:20,531 --> 00:46:24,160
It was terrible. So he knew, hey,
entire organizations can go nuts.

856
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:26,470
I just have to be quiet and wait it out.

857
00:46:27,630 --> 00:46:28,463
But he was wrong.

858
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:43,980
Thank you.
[inaudible].
