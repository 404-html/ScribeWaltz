1
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:10,510
Thank you very much.
Thank

2
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:12,160
you all for coming and thank
you for the invitation.

3
00:00:12,161 --> 00:00:15,070
When someone from Google says that
your publications are countless,

4
00:00:15,071 --> 00:00:17,040
it really means something.
Uh,

5
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:21,280
actually I wanted to say that
I'm very grateful to Google,

6
00:00:21,281 --> 00:00:22,420
not only a for inviting me,

7
00:00:22,421 --> 00:00:27,421
but because you give me my best way of
impressing people when I am trying to

8
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:32,350
blow their minds about my podcasts,
which is a,

9
00:00:32,351 --> 00:00:35,170
I tell them about it and they say,
where can I find it? And I say,

10
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:38,590
just Google the phrase
history of philosophy.

11
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:43,210
And after Wikipedia I'll be the first hit.
And they were like,

12
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:45,760
no way.
Um,

13
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:49,990
I also sometimes try to impress people
by telling them how many times it's been

14
00:00:49,991 --> 00:00:50,824
downloaded,

15
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:53,950
but I think if I told you the number
it probably wouldn't impress you,

16
00:00:53,951 --> 00:00:58,870
so it won't bother. Okay. So, um, I was
asked to come speak about this book.

17
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:01,630
This is a little slide I like to
call shameless self promotion.

18
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:04,810
So I republish this,
uh, last year, I guess.

19
00:01:04,811 --> 00:01:09,100
And it's a very short introduction to
philosophy in the Islamic world that was

20
00:01:09,101 --> 00:01:10,960
published by Oxford University press.

21
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:15,190
And nowadays when I'm
asked what areas I work on,

22
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:19,780
I usually say late ancient philosophy
and philosophy in the Islamic world.

23
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:23,140
And that's a little bit of a mouthful.
And in fact,

24
00:01:23,141 --> 00:01:27,280
when I was talking to the editors at Upi
about what to call the book, they said,

25
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:27,671
well,

26
00:01:27,671 --> 00:01:31,390
can't we just call it Islamic philosophy
if that would be a lot easier and maybe

27
00:01:31,391 --> 00:01:33,640
easier to sell? And I said, no, we can't.

28
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:38,010
And I want to first of all explain why.
So why is it called that?

29
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:39,880
Why is it called philosophy
and Islamic world?

30
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:45,520
There's really been a kind of debate
about what to call this topic.

31
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:50,530
Arabic philosophy or Islamic philosophy
as long philosophy is kind of the

32
00:01:50,531 --> 00:01:55,531
obvious thing to call it because most of
the philosophers who leap to mind from

33
00:01:56,201 --> 00:02:00,880
this tradition to the extent that any
philosophers at all leap to mind are

34
00:02:00,881 --> 00:02:01,714
Muslim.

35
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:07,140
And also a big role in this tradition is
of course played by the context of the

36
00:02:07,931 --> 00:02:09,100
chronic revelation.

37
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:14,850
So a lot of the thinkers in the
tradition are in fact sort of using

38
00:02:14,951 --> 00:02:19,600
philosophical ideas to interpret the
Koran or respond to ideas from the Quran.

39
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:24,910
Uh, but I think actually in
a way, although that's true,

40
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:27,490
and I wouldn't for a moment deny it,

41
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:32,970
it's maybe prejudges the tradition as
one that's primarily about responding to

42
00:02:33,881 --> 00:02:37,840
the Quran so that we assume that any
philosopher who was working in the Islamic

43
00:02:37,841 --> 00:02:41,680
world would necessarily have been mostly
interested in using philosophy to,

44
00:02:41,681 --> 00:02:42,191
for example,

45
00:02:42,191 --> 00:02:45,850
prove that God exists or prove that
revelation as possible or prove that

46
00:02:45,851 --> 00:02:48,940
Mohammed was really a profits.
And that the things he said are true.

47
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:53,590
There are certainly thinkers who were
very interested in that project and we're

48
00:02:53,591 --> 00:02:55,960
even primarily motivated by doing that.

49
00:02:56,230 --> 00:03:00,340
But that doesn't apply to all philosophers
who worked in the Islamic world.

50
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:02,020
And especially,

51
00:03:02,021 --> 00:03:05,710
it doesn't apply to philosophers who
worked in the Islamic world who weren't

52
00:03:05,711 --> 00:03:09,550
Muslim. And in fact, it turns out
that there were quite a few of these.

53
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:12,950
So just to give some examples.
Um,

54
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,830
the people who originally translated
Greek philosophical works into Arabic.

55
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:19,720
And I'll say more about
that in just a moment.

56
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:25,140
We're mostly Christians because they
were either from Syria or from of Syrian

57
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:29,940
extraction. This is what's
going to pass for, uh,

58
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:35,420
you know, rip from the
headlines. Relevance in my
talk, they were from Syria. Uh,

59
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,670
and the,
the,

60
00:03:37,671 --> 00:03:42,070
the reason why they were the ones you
could turn to for translating Greek works

61
00:03:42,071 --> 00:03:46,690
into Arabic is that there was a living
tradition in Syrian Christian monasteries

62
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:50,770
of working with Greek texts and
translating them into Syriac,

63
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:55,960
which is another Semitic language and
us a lot closer to Arabic. Then, um,

64
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:57,280
then Greek was,

65
00:03:57,910 --> 00:04:01,570
so they played an important role in that
transmission of Greek philosophy into

66
00:04:01,571 --> 00:04:03,760
the Islamic world's.
Uh,

67
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:08,800
and then after that you have
more Christians who engage
with these translations.

68
00:04:08,801 --> 00:04:12,910
So a good example is a group that we
sometimes called the Baghdad Aristotelians

69
00:04:12,911 --> 00:04:16,240
who lived in the 10th century,
uh,

70
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:20,860
and they were Christians and
known in this metropolis,

71
00:04:20,861 --> 00:04:25,180
the center of the Islamic empire of
Baghdad as experts and Aristotelian

72
00:04:25,181 --> 00:04:29,800
philosophy. Another example, and maybe
a more prominent example in a way,

73
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:34,240
is that a lot of important
Jewish philosophers have
lived in the Islamic world,

74
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:39,010
including the most famous and
important ever Jewish philosopher,

75
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:44,070
unless you count spinosa which
topic of a whole another talk,

76
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,210
but with Spinosa Jewish philosopher,

77
00:04:46,211 --> 00:04:51,211
but even perhaps more famous than it's
Moses [inaudible] who lived in the 12th

78
00:04:51,521 --> 00:04:53,590
century,
was born in Islamic Spain.

79
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:57,880
And when conditions became
unfavorable for Jews moved to Cairo.

80
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:03,610
So when I wrote the,
the Vsi,

81
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:06,070
and in general,
when I do research on this area,

82
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:10,450
I always try to make a big deal about
the fact that if you're going to study

83
00:05:10,451 --> 00:05:12,640
philosophy from this cultural context,

84
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:16,000
you have to realize that some of
them were Christians and Jews,

85
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:20,770
and you shouldn't therefore call
the topic Islamic philosophy.

86
00:05:20,771 --> 00:05:23,890
That would just be kind of
bizarre, right? In fact,

87
00:05:23,891 --> 00:05:27,820
it would be more appropriate to call
medieval European philosophy Christian

88
00:05:27,821 --> 00:05:32,260
philosophy than to call this Islamic
philosophy because in medieval Christian

89
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:35,620
Europe, almost all thinkers were in
fact Christians. But we don't do that.

90
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:37,790
So I don't call it as long philosophy.
Uh,

91
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:41,320
sometimes people have suggested
calling an Arabic philosophy,

92
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:44,740
and this is in part to
highlight something I just said,

93
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:50,070
which is that philosophy in the Islamic
world more or less kicks off with the

94
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:54,130
Greek Arabic translation movement
in the ninth century and century.

95
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:55,330
A lot of you are engineers.

96
00:05:55,331 --> 00:05:57,560
I should mention that this
isn't just about philosophy.

97
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:02,780
That translation movement also
renders many works of science and even

98
00:06:02,781 --> 00:06:05,660
engineering into Arabic.

99
00:06:05,661 --> 00:06:07,790
So you have works by Ptolemy,

100
00:06:07,791 --> 00:06:12,791
Euclid and other mathematicians
who are translated into Arabic.

101
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:17,150
They translated not necessarily
everything they could get their hands on,

102
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:22,280
but an astonishing amount to the point
that, for example, Aristotle who for them,

103
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:25,340
just as in medieval Europe was
the most important philosopher.

104
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:29,180
They could read pretty much all the
Aristotle we can read. But in Arabic,

105
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:30,920
um,

106
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:35,360
sometimes you might hear if you kind of
know anything about the importance of

107
00:06:35,361 --> 00:06:36,800
philosophy in the Islamic world,

108
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:42,100
one of the things that you might know
is that Europeans got their hands on

109
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:45,770
people like Aristotle
through the Islamic world.

110
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:50,030
So the idea would be Greek philosophy
was translated into Arabic in the ninth

111
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,700
and 10th centuries.
And then it was,

112
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:58,000
the Arabic versions were
translated into Latin around 1200.

113
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,160
Um,
and as you'll see,

114
00:07:01,161 --> 00:07:05,270
that's going to be an important feature
of the tradition that I'm going to talk

115
00:07:05,271 --> 00:07:09,080
about later on that translation
into Latin around 1200. Um,

116
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:10,820
and so the thought would be,
oh,

117
00:07:10,821 --> 00:07:15,740
well the reason we can read Aristotle is
because his works were translated into

118
00:07:15,741 --> 00:07:20,300
Arabic and then that from there into
Latin and it kind of medieval version of

119
00:07:20,301 --> 00:07:22,190
Chinese whispers.
Um,

120
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,810
that's actually not true because if you
think about it, we have aerosol in Greek,

121
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:29,900
we don't have to read
him in Arabic and Latin.

122
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:34,130
So actually we get Plato and
Aristotle from the Byzantine Empire,

123
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:39,110
which is basically the remnants of the
Roman Empire after had collapsed in the

124
00:07:39,111 --> 00:07:43,620
west. It survived in the east
and they still have plenty there.

125
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:46,880
There are manuscripts of Plato and
Aristotle that still exists today.

126
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,270
That's how we can read them in Greek.
But although,

127
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:53,480
although it's not true that the Greek
has completely lost for these guys,

128
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:56,830
there are some ancient philosophical
and scientific works that are only

129
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:58,040
preserved in Arabic.

130
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:03,400
And it is certainly true that for a
while in the medieval Christian world,

131
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:07,850
their primary access to ancient philosophy
was through the Arabic tradition.

132
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:13,430
And they used Muslim philosophers as
commentators and guides to understanding,

133
00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:16,850
uh, figures like Aristotle. Okay.

134
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:22,090
So this whole fact that Arabic plays
a crucial role in the transmission of

135
00:08:23,541 --> 00:08:27,110
knowledge about science and
philosophy from the ancient world.

136
00:08:27,111 --> 00:08:31,250
So ancient Greece and then the
Roman empire into the Islamic world.

137
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,300
That's certainly true.

138
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:37,600
And so an advantage of calling this field
Arabic philosophy is precisely that.

139
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:42,650
I actually am the co editor of an earlier
book called the Cambridge companion to

140
00:08:42,651 --> 00:08:46,250
Arabic philosophy,
which I would now call the,

141
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:50,660
I would out wish I had called actually
the Cambridge companion to philosophy and

142
00:08:50,661 --> 00:08:53,150
Islamic world. But this is what we
were thinking. Well, we call it that.

143
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:57,210
We were thinking it's either or Arabic
and we don't want to call it Islam Salami,

144
00:08:57,211 --> 00:09:00,300
so we have to call it Arabic. And this
seemed like a good rationale for it.

145
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:04,560
But as we actually already admitted
in the introduction to that book,

146
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:08,400
uh,
this is actually quite misleading.

147
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:13,260
So the maybe the most misleading thing
about it is that it suggests that all

148
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:18,261
philosophical and scientific literature
in the Islamic world was written in

149
00:09:18,301 --> 00:09:21,330
Arabic, which just
isn't true. So actually,

150
00:09:21,331 --> 00:09:24,030
especially if you as you go
on into the later period,

151
00:09:24,031 --> 00:09:26,790
and I'll be saying more
about that in a moment. Um,

152
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:30,990
a lot of philosophical literature from
the Islamic world is written in Persian

153
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:35,340
and there are other languages too where
they write a philosophy. So for example,

154
00:09:35,341 --> 00:09:37,050
Syriac which I've already mentioned,

155
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:40,950
so I'm actually not very happy with
Arabic philosophy anymore either.

156
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:43,230
Arabic philosophy has one other problem,

157
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:46,740
which is that whenever
you say Arabic philosophy,

158
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:51,920
people then come up to you and
various self righteously say,

159
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:56,010
oh, but you do know that most
of them weren't Arabs. Right?

160
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:58,200
Which is true actually.

161
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:02,160
So a lot of the major figures
from the Islamic world,

162
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:05,340
we're not ethnically Arabs,
but we're from Central Asia,

163
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:09,750
including [inaudible] who as we'll
see as the most important figure of in

164
00:10:09,751 --> 00:10:13,560
philosophy of the Islamic world.
But I just think that this is a,

165
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:18,710
this just shows that people don't know
English because in my opinion Arabic is a

166
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:22,170
language,
people aren't Arabic people are Arab.

167
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:24,150
I don't know what you
all think about this.

168
00:10:24,151 --> 00:10:27,090
But to me as in sort of native speaker,
that's what Arabic and heroin means.

169
00:10:27,091 --> 00:10:28,200
So this is to me a sort of,

170
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:31,770
it's sort of a fallacious reason
not to call it Arabic philosophy,

171
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:35,490
but it's really annoying to keep
getting people who keeps me,

172
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:37,910
well you know that they weren't
all Arabs so I've just done a lot,

173
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:40,260
I don't really want to deal with it.
Um,

174
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:43,470
there was actually another phrase
which is sort of sort of term of art,

175
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:46,560
which has been developed within
the field of Islamic studies,

176
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:51,800
which is the so called Islamic hate
Islamic hate would mean the geographical

177
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:58,200
regions under Muslim Dominion.
And that's really what I mean.

178
00:10:58,201 --> 00:11:01,650
So I would call it Islamic hate philosophy
if I thought people would know what

179
00:11:01,651 --> 00:11:05,280
the heck I was talking about.
But if I take it that, I mean,

180
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:09,270
if this had been called, notice how
I keep getting back to this slide.

181
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:14,190
I mean as an American emoney,
I'm a born marketer. I mean,

182
00:11:14,191 --> 00:11:16,500
imagine if it was called
Islamic hate philosophy.

183
00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:20,190
You'd have no idea what it
was about, right? Like what
does that supposed to mean?

184
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:23,880
So I don't say as long as Kate, I say
philosophy and Islamic world. Okay.

185
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:28,260
Now this is a little slide I like to
call shameless self promotion part two.

186
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:33,360
Um, if you actually look at the
bottom of this slide, that's the,

187
00:11:33,361 --> 00:11:37,080
that's where you get if you
Google history of philosophy. Um,

188
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:42,110
so I've been running a podcast since 2010
whose aim is as it says at the top of

189
00:11:43,351 --> 00:11:48,351
the books to cover the entire history of
philosophy without any gaps in 20 to 25

190
00:11:49,741 --> 00:11:54,040
minute episodes. So it starts with the
pre socratics, the Greek philosophers,

191
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:58,110
and it goes until I get hit by a bus,
uh,

192
00:11:58,810 --> 00:12:03,790
or meet some other and, or I get
to now. So sometimes people say,

193
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:07,300
well, what will you do? Like when you run
out of history of philosophy. And I say,

194
00:12:07,301 --> 00:12:11,170
well, I can just like cover whatever
it was just published that week.

195
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:17,110
Um, it comes out once a week, every
Sunday. And um, as we already heard, it's,

196
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:17,390
uh,

197
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:22,390
to episode 273 I think there is also
about 40 episodes on Indian philosophy,

198
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:25,540
which I've been doing with,
um, [inaudible] and canary.

199
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:29,800
So one of the important features of
the project is to cover philosophy in,

200
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:33,630
in other cultures. Um, and,

201
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:38,730
and also to cover philosophy in a way
that doesn't just mean talking about the

202
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,990
major figures of philosophy.
Um,

203
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:47,770
so this is kind of introduction
to this wider project.

204
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:48,550
Oh,
and I should,

205
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:51,970
maybe I should explain the relevance to
the very short introduction is that in a

206
00:12:51,971 --> 00:12:55,300
way that very short introduction is kind
of like an introduction to the material

207
00:12:55,301 --> 00:12:57,420
that I covered much more,
uh,

208
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:01,780
in depth in this book because this book
is about five times as long as the other

209
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:04,180
one, cause it's without any gaps. Okay.

210
00:13:04,181 --> 00:13:08,620
So what does it mean to do the history
of philosophy without any gaps? Well,

211
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:10,710
if you think about how,

212
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:13,570
if you sort of think about what
the history of philosophy means,

213
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:17,500
so none of you are philosophers
or professional philosophers,

214
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:20,200
but you've all heard of some philosophers,
right?

215
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:23,470
And if you conjure in your
mind who is a philosopher,

216
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:26,440
everyone sort of think of a philosopher.
Don't think of me,

217
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:30,730
think of just a kind of
generic philosopher. So
you're all thinking of a man,

218
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:33,850
probably you're thinking of a white guy,

219
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:39,040
you're probably even thinking of an
older white guy with a beard, right?

220
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:42,610
So you're basically thinking of someone
who looks like God on the chop, on the,

221
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:47,350
on the ceiling of the
Sistine Chapel, right? Uh,

222
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:49,570
and to be fair,
there are,

223
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:53,530
there have been plenty of white guys
with beards who are philosophers.

224
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:58,810
And if in fact, if you start thinking,
who are some famous philosophers?

225
00:13:58,811 --> 00:13:59,920
Like if,
if we,

226
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:03,820
if I spent the rest of the time of this
talk asking you to name philosophers,

227
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:06,790
I'm sure you would all come up with plenty
of names that you might come up with.

228
00:14:06,791 --> 00:14:10,720
Plato, Aristotle,
Socrates, Thomas Aquinas,

229
00:14:10,721 --> 00:14:13,340
Descartes' comments,
Leiden.

230
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:16,000
It's Bertrand Russell Vichtenstein,
right?

231
00:14:16,001 --> 00:14:18,520
These are all names that are
presumably known to all of you. If not,

232
00:14:18,521 --> 00:14:22,120
you can Google them. Google humor. Um,

233
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:24,790
so,
uh,

234
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,930
and of course these are all like huge
figures in the history of philosophy.

235
00:14:28,931 --> 00:14:32,190
And when I get to them, I give them
extra coverage. So for example,

236
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:35,110
Plato and Aristotle got something
like 15 episodes a piece.

237
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:37,150
And when I get to content,

238
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:40,930
God knows how many episodes that will
take me to cover him as I actually am

239
00:14:40,931 --> 00:14:43,150
already sort of getting night sweats,

240
00:14:43,151 --> 00:14:47,200
wondering how I'm possibly
going to adequately deal
with Conduent. I get to the,

241
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:48,670
to him in the podcast,

242
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:53,880
but especially because I work
in sort of more or lesser known,

243
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:57,800
let's say, uh, areas of
the history of philosophy.

244
00:14:58,130 --> 00:15:02,360
It's important to me to try to
communicate the idea that the history of

245
00:15:02,361 --> 00:15:06,620
philosophy is not just these brilliant
people who turn up every few centuries

246
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:11,960
and apparently, um, sometimes
after a long period of nothing.

247
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:16,940
So if you think about the list I just
gave you, Socrates, Plato, Aristotle,

248
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:18,710
Thomas Aquinas,

249
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:24,400
that's literally almost 2000 years
that I jumped over there because,

250
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:26,540
uh,
Socrates,

251
00:15:26,541 --> 00:15:31,541
Plato and Aristotle are fifth and
fourth century BC and Thomas Aquinas is

252
00:15:31,791 --> 00:15:35,090
anybody
close,

253
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:39,230
13th century eight d as
he died and the 1270s.

254
00:15:39,530 --> 00:15:42,470
And if we played this game
again and I said, okay,

255
00:15:42,471 --> 00:15:46,700
name me some philosophers who live
between Aristotle and Aquinas,

256
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,820
it would be a very short
discussion probably,

257
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,830
unless you've been
listening to my podcasts,

258
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:56,480
because I've done hundreds of episodes on,
on what happened in, in that gap. Okay.

259
00:15:56,900 --> 00:16:00,890
If you, and if you think
about that, I mean, let's just
step back and to get that,

260
00:16:00,891 --> 00:16:05,510
that a little bit more, that's more
than half of the history of philosophy.

261
00:16:05,690 --> 00:16:08,480
I mean, chronologically, of course,

262
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:10,970
the closer we get to the current day,

263
00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:14,290
the more text there is that survives.

264
00:16:14,291 --> 00:16:18,890
So we have much more from the 17th century
that we have from the 12th century.

265
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:24,220
But we have a lot of information about
philosophy pretty much in an unbroken

266
00:16:25,161 --> 00:16:27,570
line stemming from the,

267
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:31,430
the most ancient of the ancient
Greeks all the way up to now.

268
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:33,223
Um,

269
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:38,350
and of course it's not one single line
because it's actually multiple lines

270
00:16:38,961 --> 00:16:43,850
moving through multiple cultures,
uh, and sometimes independently.

271
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:48,740
So Islamic philosophy or philosophy in
the Islamic world as I was saying before,

272
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:51,440
draws from Greek philosophy.
Um,

273
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:54,620
but there's also philosophy in
ancient India in ancient China,

274
00:16:54,650 --> 00:16:58,340
which is basically independent
of Greek philosophy,

275
00:16:58,341 --> 00:16:59,780
although that's sometimes dispute it,

276
00:16:59,781 --> 00:17:04,310
but it's primarily independent even if
there is some filtering of ideas back and

277
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:08,040
forth. And there's also, um,
philosophical traditions.

278
00:17:08,050 --> 00:17:12,170
There's this whole philosophical tradition
of Africa, of South America, et Cetera,

279
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:15,080
which never gets covered in
courses on history of philosophy.

280
00:17:15,530 --> 00:17:18,380
So I'm trying to cover all
of this in the podcast.

281
00:17:18,381 --> 00:17:22,520
I've already done philosophy Mia
Islamic worlds and I'm now doing Indian

282
00:17:22,521 --> 00:17:24,200
philosophy with a coauthor name,

283
00:17:24,201 --> 00:17:28,250
Jeanette and Guarneri next year with
someone named Chico Jeffers who works in

284
00:17:28,251 --> 00:17:30,920
Canada. I'll be starting to
cover African philosophy,

285
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:34,550
including the flood philosophical
movements in the African diaspora.

286
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:39,920
And I'm hoping to do Chinese philosophy
after that. And then who knows. Um,

287
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:45,190
so one other thing I should mention
about not having any historical gaps is

288
00:17:45,591 --> 00:17:49,530
that, as I said, when you imagine like
a famous philosopher, you imagine woman,

289
00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:51,510
sorry, you can imagine a man, right?

290
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:55,260
But there have been plenty of
female philosophers and want, to me,

291
00:17:55,261 --> 00:18:00,240
one of the most important kind of
implications of the project is alongside

292
00:18:00,241 --> 00:18:02,130
covering philosophy from other cultures.

293
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:05,970
You cover female philosophers and you
don't cover them because you're being

294
00:18:05,971 --> 00:18:07,500
politically correct or something.

295
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:10,950
You cover them because they're there and
you're covering the entire history of

296
00:18:10,951 --> 00:18:14,890
philosophy and there's why would
you skip them? Right? So, um, I,

297
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:16,890
especially in the medieval period,

298
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:21,030
I've been able already to give a lot of
coverage to individual female thinkers

299
00:18:21,031 --> 00:18:25,590
like Hildegard of Bingen method might've
book Marguerite poets who is there on

300
00:18:25,591 --> 00:18:29,190
the left. Um, Christine [inaudible]
design, who's there on the right too.

301
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:33,450
I haven't gotten to yet, but I will. Um,
and I think that's Christine is on. Um,

302
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:38,190
so that's a real advantage I think of
the project and the way I'm doing it.

303
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,750
Okay. So, um,

304
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:43,950
for the rest of the time I want to sort
of narrow in now on philosophy and the

305
00:18:43,951 --> 00:18:48,951
Islamic world and tell you about three
kinds of implications of doing it this

306
00:18:50,041 --> 00:18:53,640
way. Um, on this topic.

307
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:57,510
So of course in a sense like covering
philosophy in the Islamic world already at

308
00:18:57,511 --> 00:19:00,870
all is sort of filling a gap because the,

309
00:19:00,871 --> 00:19:05,250
there are arguably no truly famous
philosophers from the Islamic world,

310
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:08,010
famous in the sense that Descartes
and played out her famous.

311
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:10,590
So almost everyone has heard
of Descartes and Plato.

312
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:15,150
Very few people have heard of more
than one or two Muslim philosophers.

313
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:19,200
Even you've heard of anyone you might've
heard of avid Ascena or a varies at the

314
00:19:19,201 --> 00:19:23,610
center lived, um, from the 10th to
the 11th century. He died in 10 37,

315
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:27,050
a very always lived in
twins, 12th century, uh,

316
00:19:27,090 --> 00:19:31,170
Islamic Spain and is the most important
medieval commentator on Aristotle.

317
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:33,373
Um,

318
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:38,480
and it varies is an interesting figure
because he's bound up with a kind of

319
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:44,040
narrative that you will often hear
about philosophy and the Islamic world,

320
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:49,340
which is that it flourishes with the
Greek Arabic translation movements.

321
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:52,950
And then it ends around the
end of the 12th century,

322
00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:57,750
and it may be even ends at a very
specific, it actually ends on one day,

323
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:03,120
namely the day that Avera has died and
he died in 1198 right at the end of the

324
00:20:03,121 --> 00:20:05,820
12th century. So the end,
if you think about it,

325
00:20:05,821 --> 00:20:10,821
this is in a way a very convenient
narrative because the thought would be,

326
00:20:10,891 --> 00:20:13,590
oh, well, Greek philosophy
was invented in Greece.

327
00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:17,130
Actually it already existed in
China and India before that.

328
00:20:17,131 --> 00:20:20,730
But let's leave that aside. And maybe
Egypt as well, but let's leave that aside.

329
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:24,630
So it begins in Greece,
the Roman Empire collapses.

330
00:20:25,130 --> 00:20:27,930
Ono Philosophy is dead.
Oh No,

331
00:20:27,931 --> 00:20:31,620
it's not because the Muslims come along
and save it and translate it into Arabic.

332
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:36,690
And then having fulfilled their historical
destiny by carrying the torch of

333
00:20:36,691 --> 00:20:39,270
philosophy for three or four centuries,

334
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:44,490
they then pass it on to the Medieval
Christians who translated into Latin.

335
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:48,010
And then you get Thomas Aquinas,
scholasticism,

336
00:20:48,011 --> 00:20:51,590
the renaissance and et cetera.
Um,

337
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:57,400
so one of the things I want to say and
emphasize a lot in both the podcast and

338
00:20:58,541 --> 00:21:01,930
the very short introduction
is that this is just not true.

339
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:07,230
And that this whole story
about philosophies basically
ending around 1200 in the

340
00:21:08,171 --> 00:21:12,880
Islamic world is a kind of meth.
I just checked the time. Um,

341
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,620
so that's one thing I want to say.

342
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:18,910
Another thing I want to sort of narrow
in on a bit more is to say more about

343
00:21:18,911 --> 00:21:21,130
that Christian philosophers
I was mentioning before,

344
00:21:21,131 --> 00:21:24,630
just as an example of what I was
saying earlier, which is that um,

345
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:29,880
this is kind of an ekin
ecumenical historical
phenomenon is not only the story

346
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:33,430
of Muslims using philosophy
to understand the Koran.

347
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:37,890
And the last thing I want to do just
briefly say something about, um,

348
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,340
Islamic theology,

349
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:44,200
which is a kind of test case
for my approach of including
absolutely everything

350
00:21:44,201 --> 00:21:48,310
you might want to include in philosophy,
in the history of philosophy. Okay.

351
00:21:48,311 --> 00:21:51,670
So first something about philosophy
of the later Islamic world.

352
00:21:51,970 --> 00:21:56,620
Here's a map which shows the three,
actually not all of,

353
00:21:56,650 --> 00:22:01,540
but most of the cause, the Ottoman Empire
is cut off there, but the three later,

354
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:04,300
uh,
empires in the Islamic world.

355
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:08,140
So these are the empires that exist
around the time of early modern Europe.

356
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:11,860
So around the time of the enlightenment
or the late Renaissance and

357
00:22:11,861 --> 00:22:15,400
enlightenment. So like Descartes'
live minutes, that period,

358
00:22:15,401 --> 00:22:19,150
this is what the Islamic world looks
like and moving up into the 17th,

359
00:22:19,151 --> 00:22:21,990
18th centuries.
And if you look at that math,

360
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:26,470
you can see that it's pretty damn
big, right? Um, incidentally,

361
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:27,640
for those who don't know,

362
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:32,880
the clash between Sunni and Shiite Islam
today is traceable to some extent to

363
00:22:34,421 --> 00:22:35,830
the fact that the Ottoman Empire,

364
00:22:35,831 --> 00:22:40,240
the green bit is Sunni and the
south of an empire, the red, pink,

365
00:22:40,510 --> 00:22:45,460
orange, but is a Shiite. So when the
[inaudible] came to power in Iran,

366
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:50,500
they, um, they sort of
turned Iran Shiite or, um,

367
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:53,920
made sure that Iran would stay
shy and it still is today.

368
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:56,860
And Muslims also had
control over much of India,

369
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:59,560
and there were philosophers
and all three of these areas.

370
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:03,070
Notice that we're way past
the 12th century here.

371
00:23:03,490 --> 00:23:08,440
Here's a selective list of some
philosophers who lived after 1200. Um,

372
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:11,920
okay, fuck. At the end of that, I
was, he didn't live much after 1200,

373
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:15,940
but I put him on because he's a really
important and interesting figure in the

374
00:23:15,941 --> 00:23:19,720
history of philosophical theology
that I'll be talking about later on.

375
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:23,130
But Ozzy and twosie or both
commentators on the center,

376
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:26,960
and because Dune is who you might've
heard of actually is a very famous a

377
00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:31,420
theorist of history and wrote this amazing
history of the Islamic world where he

378
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:36,730
prefaces it with an explanation of
how civilizations rise and fall.

379
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,700
Um,
the school of Shit Oz,

380
00:23:39,701 --> 00:23:44,701
which is exists just before the rise of
the south of ids in Iran was a kind of a

381
00:23:47,481 --> 00:23:51,050
group of Addison and philosophers who
argued about the interpretation of his

382
00:23:51,051 --> 00:23:54,530
works.
Moolah Sadra is an importance later.

383
00:23:54,531 --> 00:23:58,460
Mystic philosopher who
lives in the south of it,

384
00:23:58,461 --> 00:24:02,720
empire cut to genove is,
uh, an important Ottoman,

385
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:06,140
a philosopher data. She,
Ku is a really amazing guy.

386
00:24:06,170 --> 00:24:10,790
He lived in Mughal India and he was a
prince who was assassinated or actually

387
00:24:10,791 --> 00:24:15,620
had, had put on trial and killed by his
brothers to get him out of the line of

388
00:24:15,621 --> 00:24:16,454
succession.

389
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:21,880
And he was a kind of scholar who was
fascinated with ancient Indian thoughts.

390
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:27,820
So he translated the opening shots and
wrote a book called the confluence of the

391
00:24:28,071 --> 00:24:32,720
two oceans where he argued that the
teachings of the Koran as sort of filtered

392
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:36,890
through Sufism and the teachings
of the ancient Indian scriptures,

393
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:40,640
like the punish Hud's actually
amounted to the same teachings.

394
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:46,250
So he's quite interesting. Um, if
I had a body is another later, um,

395
00:24:47,270 --> 00:24:51,740
uh, Mocha or Indian
rather a philosopher. Um,

396
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:55,970
and then I put on Mohammed Abdul who
is an interesting turn of the century

397
00:24:55,971 --> 00:24:59,750
philosopher and mentioned fats in my
mind now Niecy because she's one of the

398
00:24:59,751 --> 00:25:02,630
more interesting female
thinkers from the last century.

399
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:06,380
One of the problems I actually ran into
when I was doing philosophy Islamic

400
00:25:06,381 --> 00:25:09,830
world is that I really want it to cover,
as I said before,

401
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:12,530
I want it to cover female
thinkers in the Islamic world.

402
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:16,220
And it's not a very good picture there.
So you can,

403
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:20,810
you find some interesting female thinkers
over the last hundred and 50 years or

404
00:25:20,811 --> 00:25:23,000
so. Um, prior to that,

405
00:25:23,001 --> 00:25:27,680
there are quite a few female
scholars in the Islamic world,

406
00:25:27,890 --> 00:25:32,600
but not anyone who you
could really designate as a
philosopher as far as I know.

407
00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:37,510
But if anyone has a counter example,
I would love to hear it. Okay. So, um,

408
00:25:37,550 --> 00:25:40,100
the point of that was just,
sorry, before I leave this,

409
00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:42,390
so the point of that was just,
I mean in a way I'm,

410
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:46,340
I can just show you that this narrative
of decline is wrong by saying, well,

411
00:25:46,341 --> 00:25:50,070
here are some people that
the narrative leaves out. Um,

412
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:55,700
maybe I should say that there is actually
a cause you might be sitting there

413
00:25:55,701 --> 00:25:59,750
thinking, well, hang on a second with
these people all exist. Then why,

414
00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:04,220
why is it that when we pick up like a
Bertrand Russell's history of philosophy

415
00:26:04,221 --> 00:26:07,610
or actually pretty much almost any
textbook on the history of philosophy,

416
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:12,440
if it bothers dimension, philosophy,
the Islamic world at all, it says, well,

417
00:26:12,441 --> 00:26:16,820
it ends around 1200.
Why do we get that idea if,

418
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:21,300
what's with all these people? So
how did this happen? And the answer,

419
00:26:21,301 --> 00:26:23,240
it goes back to something I said earlier,

420
00:26:24,050 --> 00:26:27,740
which is the Arabic Latin
translation movement.

421
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:30,500
So remember I said that
happened around 1200.

422
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:35,140
It was mostly in Spain where the
Islamic and Christian worlds, we're, um,

423
00:26:35,570 --> 00:26:39,710
we're confronting one another and it
actually even involved collaboration

424
00:26:39,711 --> 00:26:44,640
between Christian, Muslim and Jewish
scholars who would sort of team up to,

425
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:46,800
uh,
translate things from Arabic into Latin.

426
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:52,260
And the effect of that was to
translate not just things like that,

427
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:54,060
not just Greek works like Aristotle,

428
00:26:54,330 --> 00:26:58,650
but also works by a Muslim philosophers
like avid, avid, Santa and Avera ways.

429
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:04,310
So the death of philosophy in the Islamic
world to some extent is an illusion

430
00:27:05,010 --> 00:27:08,070
created by the date of
that translation movements.

431
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:13,320
Because what it meant was that anyone who
lived after that or too far east to be

432
00:27:13,321 --> 00:27:18,321
translated around 1200 in Spain
was just unknown in Europe.

433
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:20,160
And because they were unknown in Europe,

434
00:27:20,190 --> 00:27:24,490
they played no role in influencing
people like Aquinas and more generally a

435
00:27:24,491 --> 00:27:25,800
medieval scholasticism.

436
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:31,140
And that further amend that in the
19th and 20th century when modern day

437
00:27:31,141 --> 00:27:34,770
scholars turned their attention to
look at philosophy, the Islamic world,

438
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:38,520
they thought, well, what we need
to do is study, have a Senate,

439
00:27:38,521 --> 00:27:43,230
and a Vero is they ride the red them in
the medieval Latin translation or they

440
00:27:43,231 --> 00:27:45,240
even learned Arabic and
read them in the original,

441
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:48,810
but they weren't interested in looking
at later if the thinkers who had no

442
00:27:48,811 --> 00:27:53,640
impacts on Europe like these people.
Uh,

443
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:58,440
so in a way that tradition splits.
And until very recently,

444
00:27:58,441 --> 00:28:02,700
most scholars have only been interested
in the kind of line of medieval

445
00:28:02,701 --> 00:28:07,020
philosophy or line of Islamic philosophy
that gets received in the medieval west.

446
00:28:08,370 --> 00:28:13,290
Okay. So Christian philosophers,
um, like I said, um,

447
00:28:13,410 --> 00:28:17,610
one of the most important roles of
Christians in the philosophical tradition

448
00:28:17,611 --> 00:28:22,611
I've been describing is the translation
of works from Greek into Arabic.

449
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:27,840
And I just wanted to
mention a few examples. Um,

450
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:30,780
so there's this guy who night in is huck,

451
00:28:30,810 --> 00:28:35,710
who was from Iraq and his son was named,
is huck even a nine,

452
00:28:35,730 --> 00:28:36,870
if it means son of,

453
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:41,130
and it's actually this sort of confusing
naming practice is quite common

454
00:28:41,190 --> 00:28:45,990
unfortunately. Um, and
they're very interesting. A
couple of guys. So who nine,

455
00:28:46,110 --> 00:28:50,940
uh, was raised to speak, be able to
speak classical Greek and his family.

456
00:28:50,941 --> 00:28:55,050
So he tells a story about being told
to recite homer as a child to impress

457
00:28:55,051 --> 00:28:57,810
visitors to their home,
which I'm sure worked.

458
00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:01,770
And he was a specialist
in medical literature.

459
00:29:02,130 --> 00:29:07,130
He translated the works of
the late ancient medical
authority gallon from Greek

460
00:29:07,681 --> 00:29:11,110
into Arabic or from Greek into Syriac.
Um,

461
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:14,490
and then he would often have an assistant
translate the Syriac into Arabic

462
00:29:14,491 --> 00:29:19,170
because that's easier. And his son
is [inaudible] nine was one of the,

463
00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:22,470
probably the greatest translator
of Aristotle into Arabic.

464
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:27,680
So they're kind of a one family factory
for rendering Greek works of philosophy

465
00:29:29,281 --> 00:29:33,920
and science into Arabic. Um,
and they're both Christians. Uh,

466
00:29:34,050 --> 00:29:37,350
there are other Christians around the
same time who collaborate with Muslims,

467
00:29:37,590 --> 00:29:38,610
with the Muslims,

468
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:42,670
basically paying them and also telling
them what they want translated.

469
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:47,140
One of the interesting things to look at
is w what things they translate and how

470
00:29:47,141 --> 00:29:51,010
early. So for example, they make,

471
00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:55,690
one of the choices they make is that
early on they translate works that will

472
00:29:55,691 --> 00:29:59,350
help them engage in
dialectical disputation.

473
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:00,880
And the idea here,

474
00:30:00,881 --> 00:30:03,730
it seems to be that they don't want the
Christians to be the only people who

475
00:30:03,731 --> 00:30:07,900
know how to make good arguments because
then they'll lose in the public debates

476
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:10,450
over whether Islam as
better than Christianity.

477
00:30:10,630 --> 00:30:14,860
So ironically they pay Christians to
translate books to give them the kind of

478
00:30:14,861 --> 00:30:17,980
argumentative weapons to
argue with Christians.

479
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:21,200
And a good example of this
actually is, um, yeah,

480
00:30:21,210 --> 00:30:26,210
he had been id who is a really fascinating
figure for whom we have a lot of

481
00:30:26,381 --> 00:30:30,550
works, including a bunch of works that
were only just discovered in a manuscript.

482
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:33,310
And that's held in Ted
on just a few years ago.

483
00:30:33,550 --> 00:30:37,670
And I've been involved in editing and
translating a few of these treatises. Um,

484
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:40,660
he's really interesting because he's
a Christian philosopher who lives in

485
00:30:40,661 --> 00:30:41,494
Baghdad,

486
00:30:41,650 --> 00:30:45,880
but he had Muslim colleagues who
are also members of the same school.

487
00:30:46,210 --> 00:30:51,210
And we have an exchange between him and
a Jewish philosopher where the Jewish

488
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:53,920
scholar ask some
questions about Aristotle.

489
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:57,910
And yet you have an ID writes back and
explains the answer is that it's a really

490
00:30:57,911 --> 00:31:02,890
good example of the way that philosophy
was a kind of three way interchange

491
00:31:02,891 --> 00:31:07,330
between the three Abrahamic
faiths in the Islamic world.

492
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:10,060
Um, another thing I just
wanted to mention briefly,

493
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:14,950
although I've mentioned it in passing
before, is that this language of Syriac,

494
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:16,120
which is another,
as I said,

495
00:31:16,121 --> 00:31:20,590
another Semitic language was not
only a kind of intermediary texts for

496
00:31:20,591 --> 00:31:24,430
translating from Greek into Arabic,
but was actually used to write philosophy.

497
00:31:24,431 --> 00:31:26,990
So there's another posts,
um,

498
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:31,300
host 1200 thinker by our brass
who actually wrote in Syriac.

499
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:34,120
Um,
and as I already mentioned,

500
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:37,060
a lot of important Jewish philosophers
lived in the Islamic world.

501
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:39,790
I've already mentioned my
monities, that's my monities. Um,

502
00:31:39,850 --> 00:31:44,260
earlier on in the 10th century, there's
a philosopher names idea Gowan, uh,

503
00:31:44,290 --> 00:31:46,300
who lived in Iraq and he,

504
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:50,940
when reason I want to
mention him is that he, when,

505
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,240
when you read his works,

506
00:31:52,330 --> 00:31:57,330
he's commenting on the Hebrew Bible
from a kind of philosophical theological

507
00:31:57,851 --> 00:31:58,684
point of view.

508
00:31:59,170 --> 00:32:03,130
And some of the ideas he's using are
taken from the Greek Arabic translation

509
00:32:03,550 --> 00:32:07,720
movements.
But other ideas come from this tradition.

510
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:11,500
And this is the last thing I
want to tell you still on time.

511
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:16,210
So column column is, uh, it means Xy,

512
00:32:16,211 --> 00:32:17,530
Arabic word meaning word.

513
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:22,660
So it's the Arabic for word
and it is usually trend.

514
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:26,470
It's used to refer to an intellectual
tradition in the Islamic world,

515
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:31,680
which is sometimes translated as
rational theology or Islamic theology.

516
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:34,510
Uh,
but it may be important to say that,

517
00:32:34,990 --> 00:32:39,500
I mean Cullen doesn't have anything to do
at analogically with the word theology,

518
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:43,700
which actually has a Greek
word originally. Whereas, um,

519
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:48,560
the group, the Arabic Word
for Philosophy is fun sofa.

520
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:51,530
So it's derived directly from
the Greek word for philosophy.

521
00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:55,010
And there's a kind of,

522
00:32:55,011 --> 00:32:58,550
I would say there's a sort of
quiet debate going on in my fields.

523
00:32:58,670 --> 00:33:01,640
This is the kind of thing we
argue about at conferences.

524
00:33:02,150 --> 00:33:06,470
I'm sure it's all fascinating and I'm
sure you're all really jealous about these

525
00:33:06,471 --> 00:33:09,110
wonderful arguments we have over coffee.
Uh,

526
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:14,120
so there's a kind of debate going on
about whether the study of philosophy me,

527
00:33:14,221 --> 00:33:14,811
Islamic world,

528
00:33:14,811 --> 00:33:18,890
she didn't include this material
because there's a kind of whole separate

529
00:33:18,891 --> 00:33:20,030
intellectual tradition,

530
00:33:20,031 --> 00:33:25,031
this column tradition where what
they're doing is giving rational,

531
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:27,110
uh,

532
00:33:27,110 --> 00:33:32,110
elucidations arguments and interpretations
of the Koran and other Islamic

533
00:33:33,230 --> 00:33:34,130
materials.

534
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:39,200
So one way to think
about this is that it's,

535
00:33:39,590 --> 00:33:44,210
it's very much like the fact
that in medieval Latin Europe,

536
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:47,990
a lot of the philosophers do theology.
So for example,

537
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,660
the most famous work of Thomas Aquinas,

538
00:33:50,661 --> 00:33:53,540
who I've mentioned numerous times
is the summa Theologiae. This,

539
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:57,410
the summary or the,
the summa of theology.

540
00:33:57,710 --> 00:34:01,070
And he was a theologian. There
was a, in the medieval university,

541
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:04,100
there was actually a faculty
called the theology faculty.

542
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:08,390
And most of the important medieval
Latin of philosophers were actually

543
00:34:08,391 --> 00:34:12,500
theologians, professionally,
theologians. Um,

544
00:34:12,530 --> 00:34:16,820
so my attitude about this effectively is,
well,

545
00:34:17,150 --> 00:34:21,200
if we're willing to count people like
Aquinas and other medieval theologians as

546
00:34:21,201 --> 00:34:25,270
philosophers, then we should count these
guys too. And in fact, I have a, uh,

547
00:34:25,430 --> 00:34:27,920
sort of thought experiment
I'd like people to entertain,

548
00:34:27,921 --> 00:34:32,150
which is imagine that they hadn't
translated our subtle into Arabic.

549
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:37,570
So you wouldn't have people like
[inaudible] who are primarily inspired by

550
00:34:37,911 --> 00:34:42,110
Aristotle. All you would have
had is this, this Cullen stuff.

551
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:43,333
Well,

552
00:34:43,490 --> 00:34:47,810
what would happen now when historians of
philosophy turned to the Islamic world

553
00:34:47,811 --> 00:34:49,250
and looked for stuff to study,

554
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:52,670
they would just treat this as part of
the history of philosophy completely

555
00:34:52,671 --> 00:34:57,020
unproblematically just as we treat
medieval Christian theology as part of the

556
00:34:57,021 --> 00:34:57,950
history of philosophy.

557
00:34:58,310 --> 00:35:03,020
But instead what we
get is that being part,

558
00:35:03,021 --> 00:35:06,660
because there was this distinction in
the Islamic World Itself Between Fid Sofa

559
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:09,830
philosophy and kilohm theology,
um,

560
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:13,280
people trend to treat the,
the philosophy part,

561
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:17,510
the part that's inspired by Aristotle as
the real philosophy and this stuff not

562
00:35:17,511 --> 00:35:19,410
as philosophy.
Um,

563
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:24,230
but I think this is just another way
of missing a bunch of philosophically

564
00:35:24,290 --> 00:35:26,690
interesting material. And so, um,

565
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:30,380
this whole project that I have of trying
to fill in the gaps of the history of

566
00:35:30,381 --> 00:35:35,381
philosophy to me means that you should
take things like [inaudible] seriously as

567
00:35:35,891 --> 00:35:39,240
a part of the history of philosophy.
Also, by the way, things like Sufism,

568
00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:43,680
which I also covered in the series and
even things like the physical sciences,

569
00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:48,360
like theories of optics,
theories of physical motion and so on.

570
00:35:48,570 --> 00:35:50,880
Um, I tried it and even
the history of mathematics,

571
00:35:50,881 --> 00:35:53,130
I try to cover that in the
podcast series as well.

572
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:58,770
And a little bit in the very short
introduction. Okay. So just to wrap up,

573
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:03,360
um, the, what's the point of all this?

574
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:06,840
So as you might've been
able to tell by now,

575
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:11,280
I'm like really a history of
philosophy nerd. And in fact,

576
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:14,910
I mean the reason I do
the podcast in a way,

577
00:36:14,911 --> 00:36:18,930
it's just kind of curiosity about
the history of philosophy. Um,

578
00:36:19,830 --> 00:36:21,700
and for me,
the,

579
00:36:21,810 --> 00:36:26,700
the point of it is to tell the history
of philosophy is one continuous story.

580
00:36:26,910 --> 00:36:30,690
So a narrative that doesn't miss anything
out, but someone might say, well,

581
00:36:30,691 --> 00:36:32,820
I'm not really interested in
about in that. Like I don't,

582
00:36:32,910 --> 00:36:36,210
it's not like normal history where you
need to know each thing that happens.

583
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:39,240
What we should care
about is the big ideas,

584
00:36:39,241 --> 00:36:41,070
the greatest figures
and what they have said.

585
00:36:41,430 --> 00:36:44,220
So I'm perfectly happy
to be told about cons,

586
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:48,420
but I don't want to be told about all of
the other random little German figures

587
00:36:48,421 --> 00:36:51,030
that contra was reading and responding
to you because they're probably quite

588
00:36:51,031 --> 00:36:54,270
boring. Right? And this
is an, to be honest,

589
00:36:54,330 --> 00:36:57,810
at least tacitly the attitude that
most historians of philosophy have,

590
00:36:58,770 --> 00:37:00,660
if only because of lack
of time and energy.

591
00:37:01,350 --> 00:37:05,250
But I think this is a mistake and there's
several reasons I think it's a mistake.

592
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:10,580
One is that if you do genuinely want to
understand someone like Plato or Aquinas

593
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:16,260
or cons, you had better know
what they were responding to.

594
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:21,300
And comment isn't responding to the last
most famous philosopher he's responding

595
00:37:21,301 --> 00:37:25,350
to his contemporaries, people
in the previous generation, um,

596
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:27,960
dozens and dozens of authors
who are now forgotten.

597
00:37:28,290 --> 00:37:31,530
And of course that's true for
everyone in the history of philosophy.

598
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:34,980
It's a lot like the history of art.
So if you go to museums,

599
00:37:35,190 --> 00:37:37,470
there's like the really
famous people like Picasso,

600
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:40,920
but then in the same galleries there's
paintings by people you haven't

601
00:37:40,921 --> 00:37:41,910
necessarily heard of.

602
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:45,630
And you can see that causes in dialogue
with these less famous people, right?

603
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:49,080
It's the same thing in the
history of philosophy. Um,

604
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:51,180
but in addition to that,

605
00:37:51,510 --> 00:37:55,500
it's just not true that
the really interesting
philosophical ideas only turn up

606
00:37:55,501 --> 00:37:59,880
in the most famous authors, they kind
of have a better hit rate, right?

607
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:02,220
There's more interesting
ideas per page maybe,

608
00:38:02,221 --> 00:38:05,190
or they just have a larger
total number of great ideas.

609
00:38:05,191 --> 00:38:08,560
And that's why we think they're so
awesome. But actually a lot of minor,

610
00:38:08,561 --> 00:38:11,580
supposedly minor or lesser and
unfit years are just as interesting.

611
00:38:11,581 --> 00:38:13,710
Like have a center for instance,

612
00:38:14,580 --> 00:38:19,580
and even more minor figures may have a
brilliant argument or idea somewhere in

613
00:38:20,071 --> 00:38:24,960
there. Otherwise rather derivative
and Turgid works, right?

614
00:38:25,290 --> 00:38:28,110
So I think if what you're interested
in is finding good philosophy,

615
00:38:28,230 --> 00:38:30,180
you should look everywhere
where it might be.

616
00:38:30,390 --> 00:38:31,890
And you should take it wherever it comes,

617
00:38:32,070 --> 00:38:35,010
even if it's in a work that's
primarily not a philosophical work,

618
00:38:35,050 --> 00:38:39,610
like a theological work or a
mystical work. And the other thing,

619
00:38:39,611 --> 00:38:41,770
which I haven't said very much about,
but if you want,

620
00:38:41,771 --> 00:38:44,590
we can talk about it in the Q and a,
is um,

621
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:48,640
well how does all of this relate to what's
going on in the contemporary Islamic

622
00:38:48,641 --> 00:38:49,660
world?
I mean,

623
00:38:49,661 --> 00:38:54,220
I'm not an expert on contemporary
Islamic culture or politics,

624
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:55,780
but it does.
I mean,

625
00:38:55,810 --> 00:39:00,810
even I can see that it's intuitive and
obvious in a way that if it philosophy in

626
00:39:02,681 --> 00:39:04,720
the Islamic world had ended it in 1200,

627
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:08,200
it would be a very minimal relevance
for what's going on now. Right?

628
00:39:08,201 --> 00:39:11,770
Because that was not very good at math.
You're probably all very good at math,

629
00:39:11,771 --> 00:39:13,780
but it was a long time ago.
Right?

630
00:39:14,350 --> 00:39:18,850
Whereas if we take seriously the idea
that philosophy in the Islamic world is a

631
00:39:18,851 --> 00:39:23,230
kind of continuous tradition that
God does survive the death of,

632
00:39:23,590 --> 00:39:28,590
of Airways and go on century after
century into empires like the Ottoman and

633
00:39:30,141 --> 00:39:34,210
some of it empire whose political
structures still in a way structure the

634
00:39:34,211 --> 00:39:38,740
contemporary political, uh, scene
in the Islamic world, then we,

635
00:39:38,950 --> 00:39:42,060
that's a big step in the
direction of seeing how, um,

636
00:39:42,310 --> 00:39:47,200
these historical traditions affect
the world we're living in today. Okay.

637
00:39:47,230 --> 00:39:48,063
Thanks very much.

638
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:56,290
Thank you very much.
We do have time for questions.

639
00:39:56,470 --> 00:39:57,880
Please wait for the microphone.
Yup.

640
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:02,333
Nope.

641
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:05,890
Nice. Very interesting
talking. And, um, uh,

642
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:11,310
we have been talking more
about the interaction with
west and the Arabic world.

643
00:40:11,850 --> 00:40:16,850
And so what about in similar
kind of interaction that
happened to the east India

644
00:40:17,041 --> 00:40:21,300
or a pushy or China?
We know that through the art,

645
00:40:21,510 --> 00:40:23,550
through the mathematics,
a lot of interaction has happened.

646
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:28,800
So what about on the philosophical side?
Yeah. Uh, is there more specifically,

647
00:40:29,010 --> 00:40:33,870
is there anything that has been,
um, but the Indian philosophy,

648
00:40:33,871 --> 00:40:37,950
whether it has been influenced by
Arabic in a major Arab Islamic world

649
00:40:37,951 --> 00:40:42,720
philosophy in some major way
and Robert's also, right.

650
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:46,670
Okay. Having heard about
anything like that, thank you.

651
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:48,960
Last part a little worse?

652
00:40:49,150 --> 00:40:54,150
Or how would they can gain philosophy
affected or influenced on enhance the

653
00:40:55,290 --> 00:40:57,090
Islamic world philosophy?
Okay.

654
00:40:57,610 --> 00:41:01,900
Yeah. So, um, actually one of
the questions I get most often,

655
00:41:01,901 --> 00:41:06,310
especially now that I'm doing podcasts
on Indian philosophy is whether Indian

656
00:41:06,311 --> 00:41:09,760
philosophy was influenced by Greek
philosophy or vice versa. And I'm,

657
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:14,820
I tend to be a skeptic about that because
there's no Sanskrit Greek translation

658
00:41:15,311 --> 00:41:20,230
movements or vice versa.
You get a lot of striking similarities.

659
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:24,790
For example, just to take one science
scientific example, um, there's a,

660
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:29,350
there's a, you know, there's a theory
of the four humors in ancient medicine,

661
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:34,340
blood bile and F. Dot. The two
kinds bile and phlegm, right,

662
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:35,960
which constitute the human body.

663
00:41:36,290 --> 00:41:38,840
And there's a very similar
humoral theory in India,

664
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:42,170
although it's not the same humors
and there's five and not four.

665
00:41:42,171 --> 00:41:46,570
So it doesn't match up exactly. But it
sort of makes you think, um, and there's,

666
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:51,700
and we also have very concrete cases where
Greek astronomy and astrology affects

667
00:41:52,101 --> 00:41:57,080
India and vice versa. So that's
clear. Um, but I actually,

668
00:41:57,081 --> 00:41:59,750
generally speaking,
I don't personally,

669
00:41:59,751 --> 00:42:03,380
I don't think that the influence of
Indian philosophy on Greek philosophy was

670
00:42:03,381 --> 00:42:07,520
strong if it was there at all. And
there were reverse as far as I can tell,

671
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:11,390
nothing. Okay. With Islam
it's very different.

672
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:15,680
So, so obviously first of all,
it's the Islamic world is,

673
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:19,610
is very different from India and China
because it's massively engaged with Greek

674
00:42:19,611 --> 00:42:22,460
philosophy. As I've been saying. Uh,

675
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:27,290
it is also engaged with Indian culture.
So I mentioned data who he's really late,

676
00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:28,640
so he's an interesting case.

677
00:42:28,910 --> 00:42:33,530
But there's also a contemporary of
Addison is named [inaudible] who,

678
00:42:33,590 --> 00:42:37,730
uh, in fact wrote an exchange
of letters with [inaudible].

679
00:42:38,150 --> 00:42:42,290
Like the other one that I mentioned
where Bertone ass tricky questions about

680
00:42:42,291 --> 00:42:45,350
science and philosophy and have
a center has to try to answer.

681
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:50,570
And Buitoni wrote a work called a hint,
meaning India in which he,

682
00:42:50,810 --> 00:42:53,500
um, he's basically
interviewed, he lives on,

683
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:57,710
he lived very near India
and he's speaking to, um,

684
00:42:57,740 --> 00:43:02,740
basically prisoners of war or
guests of the local warlord.

685
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:07,070
And he interviewed them about their
culture and wrote this huge work about

686
00:43:07,071 --> 00:43:08,630
Indian culture and religion.

687
00:43:08,990 --> 00:43:13,110
And it has some stuff about
philosophy and it as well. So, um,

688
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:18,110
that's an early case. That's, and that's,
uh, so that would be 10th, 11th century.

689
00:43:18,530 --> 00:43:23,380
So it's around 1100. Um, no, sorry,
it's around. It's around 1080.

690
00:43:23,870 --> 00:43:28,700
Uh, and, um, really from
that point on, you have a,

691
00:43:28,910 --> 00:43:31,760
an interweaving of Indian
and Islamic culture.

692
00:43:31,761 --> 00:43:35,270
And of course the Mughal empire is
an Indian empire that's Islamic.

693
00:43:35,570 --> 00:43:37,880
So there's no doubt that,
um,

694
00:43:37,970 --> 00:43:41,750
once you get past the kind of
formative early period of Islam,

695
00:43:41,930 --> 00:43:45,830
you have a lot of interaction
between Islam and India. Uh,

696
00:43:45,860 --> 00:43:50,810
prior to that, it's more minimal,
but you find very strong influence,

697
00:43:50,811 --> 00:43:54,590
especially in the sciences, like
in astronomy, again. So, um,

698
00:43:54,980 --> 00:43:57,440
if you look into Islamic
astronomy and astrology,

699
00:43:57,590 --> 00:44:00,920
they make constant reference to Indian
theories of astronomy. And astrology,

700
00:44:00,921 --> 00:44:05,090
they even talk about the Indian world
cycles and how long they are and things

701
00:44:05,091 --> 00:44:09,350
like that. So there's plenty of evidence
for that for the Islam India exchange.

702
00:44:11,890 --> 00:44:16,520
More questions.
Um,

703
00:44:17,590 --> 00:44:22,360
one question that you mentioned, um,
just to expand a bit on the Africa side,

704
00:44:22,930 --> 00:44:27,190
um, what is the connection or is there
a connection with the Islamic world,

705
00:44:27,310 --> 00:44:32,280
especially with the library of
Alexandria and the Tunisian Center

706
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:37,120
and Sophie fluence when they
were under, um, the ultimate, uh,

707
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:42,510
occupation and basically, yeah.
Okay. So actually, I mean, just as,

708
00:44:42,990 --> 00:44:45,510
um,
just as for a while,

709
00:44:45,540 --> 00:44:49,620
Islam philosophy and Islamic world is
just part of Indian philosophy because the

710
00:44:49,621 --> 00:44:51,690
moment,
I mean the mogul empire is Indian.

711
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:55,640
So the Ottoman Empire to a
larger extent is African. I mean,

712
00:44:55,740 --> 00:44:58,680
not to a larger time that part of
its African. Right. And some of,

713
00:44:58,770 --> 00:45:03,470
and I mentioned at least one thinker who
is from Africa named Nicole doing, uh,

714
00:45:03,750 --> 00:45:08,220
so you have, so often people talk
about the mud, the Malcolm hub,

715
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:12,450
the western Islamic world, which for
a while of course included Spain.

716
00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:16,080
And you can think about Islamic Spain,
northern Africa,

717
00:45:16,081 --> 00:45:20,910
all the way over to Cairo,
to Egypt as a cultural unit,

718
00:45:21,390 --> 00:45:26,390
which is the western analog to the
Islamic heartlands in basically Iraq and

719
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:32,640
Iran. And then if further into
Central Asia. Okay. So, um,

720
00:45:33,090 --> 00:45:36,930
on the one hand, uh, so okay,

721
00:45:36,931 --> 00:45:40,140
that's true for the Islamic world, but
also if you think about late antiquity,

722
00:45:40,650 --> 00:45:44,970
the Roman Empire to a larger
extent is north African, right?

723
00:45:45,090 --> 00:45:46,110
So one by the way,

724
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:51,111
one of my favorite tips to give people
is if you're ever playing 20 questions,

725
00:45:52,051 --> 00:45:55,050
you know this game where you think
of someone, they have to, right?

726
00:45:55,350 --> 00:45:58,350
So usually people will try to narrow
down who you're thinking of it by finding

727
00:45:58,351 --> 00:45:59,970
out where they're from,
right?

728
00:46:00,540 --> 00:46:05,540
Picked Saint Augustan because Saint
Augustan is from northern Africa,

729
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:11,490
right? If he's from Tunisia
and no one will ever get
that. So if they think, okay,

730
00:46:11,491 --> 00:46:12,870
I'm trying to think of an African person,

731
00:46:12,871 --> 00:46:15,110
they'll ever come up with Saint Augustan.
Uh,

732
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:17,640
of course now that we videoed
this and put it on the Internet,

733
00:46:17,670 --> 00:46:22,080
it's not nearly as good at
Typ, but, okay. So, so, um,

734
00:46:22,110 --> 00:46:24,390
and then you just mentioned
the library of Alexandria.

735
00:46:24,570 --> 00:46:29,570
So that Alexandria is really the
last phase of philosophy muse in late

736
00:46:30,181 --> 00:46:31,014
antiquity.

737
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:35,580
And when these guys translated
Greek philosophy into Arabic,

738
00:46:35,790 --> 00:46:38,110
they aren't only translating
things like Aristotle,

739
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:42,270
they're translating the commentaries
written on our subtle in Alexandria.

740
00:46:42,780 --> 00:46:46,890
So actually both in late antiquity, in
the, in the period of the Roman Empire.

741
00:46:46,891 --> 00:46:51,891
And then also during the Islamic empire
is you have northern Africa completely

742
00:46:53,671 --> 00:46:55,920
involved culturally.
And so it's actually not,

743
00:46:56,420 --> 00:47:01,140
it's very unhelpful here to think as
we normally do about Europe because

744
00:47:01,141 --> 00:47:03,540
actually what you've got
is a Mediterranean sphere,

745
00:47:04,410 --> 00:47:08,610
which includes the Byzantine Empire in
that period as well until it falls to the

746
00:47:08,611 --> 00:47:12,090
Ottomans.
And then you've got another sphere,

747
00:47:12,180 --> 00:47:16,140
which is the Islamic East, which
actually is where most of the action is.

748
00:47:16,220 --> 00:47:20,400
It philosophically, but not
all of the action. Um, so, uh,

749
00:47:20,460 --> 00:47:25,240
really north African philosophy
is constantly involved in, in,

750
00:47:25,241 --> 00:47:26,040
in fact,
one of the,

751
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:31,040
one of the things I've been talking to
with my future coauthor she k about is

752
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:34,000
how do we deal with the fact that I
already covered a bunch of African

753
00:47:34,001 --> 00:47:37,360
philosophy because we're going to
start by talking about ancient Egypt's,

754
00:47:37,660 --> 00:47:40,720
but I actually already covered a bunch
of African philosophers like these

755
00:47:40,721 --> 00:47:42,700
Alexandria and commentators and Augustan.

756
00:47:42,940 --> 00:47:44,830
So we're just going to kind
of mention that and say,

757
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:48,820
go listen to the old episode if you want
to know about that and then move on.

758
00:47:49,180 --> 00:47:49,841
But you're right that,

759
00:47:49,841 --> 00:47:52,960
that's completely integrated into
everything that I was just saying. Really.

760
00:47:59,670 --> 00:48:04,670
So what are the different motives that
actually drove these philosophers to

761
00:48:06,451 --> 00:48:08,490
actually go about their work?
So for example,

762
00:48:08,730 --> 00:48:13,590
you mentioned some doing it for
purpose of debating religion,

763
00:48:13,591 --> 00:48:18,490
say yeah. Um, whereas others may do it
just purely academically as it were. Yeah.

764
00:48:19,220 --> 00:48:22,670
Yeah. So of course that varies
from thinker to thinker. Uh,

765
00:48:22,671 --> 00:48:26,210
one thing that seems to have
happened, uh, in both the Latin,

766
00:48:26,211 --> 00:48:28,460
medieval and medieval Islamic worlds,

767
00:48:28,790 --> 00:48:32,420
is that you get a kind of
person who considers himself,

768
00:48:32,421 --> 00:48:36,800
and it's always a him to be a
kind of professional philosopher.

769
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:42,080
So in a Latin medieval context,
it's not these theologians I've mentioned,

770
00:48:42,081 --> 00:48:43,490
there was a theology of faculty.

771
00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:47,420
There's also something called the arts
faculty where they taught students logic.

772
00:48:47,990 --> 00:48:50,900
Um, and by the way, that
just interesting fact,

773
00:48:51,080 --> 00:48:53,330
the students are teenagers.

774
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:58,400
The medieval universities student would
have been starting off at 13 or 14 and

775
00:48:58,401 --> 00:49:02,690
they would be taught Aristotelian logic
and then they would move up and maybe

776
00:49:02,691 --> 00:49:05,900
become a master at the university,
either of arts or theology.

777
00:49:06,140 --> 00:49:08,330
And these arts guys,
we're not theologians.

778
00:49:08,331 --> 00:49:11,450
And we're very clear that that's not
what they were doing. So for example,

779
00:49:11,451 --> 00:49:15,100
there's a 14th century philosopher
named John Burden who just says, well,

780
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:18,950
I'm an arts master. I do logic
and physics. I do Aristotle,

781
00:49:18,951 --> 00:49:20,300
I'm a specialist in Aristotle,

782
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:23,600
and this theology stuff is sort
of above my pay grade. Right?

783
00:49:24,140 --> 00:49:27,560
And you've had the same kind of thing
going on in the Islamic world. So,

784
00:49:27,830 --> 00:49:30,110
especially someone like [inaudible],
he,

785
00:49:30,170 --> 00:49:34,850
he was actually a Muslim jurists as well.
But in his philosophical works,

786
00:49:34,851 --> 00:49:37,030
he very explicitly presents himself as an,

787
00:49:37,130 --> 00:49:41,090
as an expert on Aristotle who's
explaining, so it's like his,

788
00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:46,840
his intellectual mission is to recover
and explain the teachings of Aristotle

789
00:49:48,350 --> 00:49:51,200
because he just thinks Aristotle's
the greatest thinker has ever lived.

790
00:49:51,650 --> 00:49:56,300
And then he, when he comes to think about
how that relates to the Koran, he says,

791
00:49:56,990 --> 00:50:00,620
philosophers are the people in the best
position to interpret the Quran because

792
00:50:00,621 --> 00:50:04,730
they already know what's true because
they have proofs and everyone else is just

793
00:50:04,731 --> 00:50:06,920
kind of lost in the dark.
And they can,

794
00:50:06,950 --> 00:50:09,050
and they should follow the
surface meaning of the Quran,

795
00:50:09,051 --> 00:50:11,420
but they shouldn't really try to interpret
it because they'll just come up with

796
00:50:11,421 --> 00:50:15,050
all kinds of wacky ideas, whereas
philosophers is actually know the truth.

797
00:50:15,380 --> 00:50:17,900
And so they can sort of
explain how the Quran,

798
00:50:18,690 --> 00:50:21,230
it's expressing something
they already know to be true.

799
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:26,540
So that's a very radical rationalist
projects. And it's unusual.

800
00:50:26,990 --> 00:50:31,990
Most philosophers have a much more nuanced
view about the relationship between

801
00:50:32,601 --> 00:50:36,680
philosophy and their Abrahamic faith,
whichever of the three that it is.

802
00:50:37,070 --> 00:50:41,330
And they may or may not admit that there
are certain things you can know through

803
00:50:41,331 --> 00:50:44,690
revelation that he wouldn't be
able to know through reason. Um,

804
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:48,230
but generally speaking,
uh, this may surprise you.

805
00:50:48,590 --> 00:50:52,400
The philosophers and the Islamic world
in all three faiths tend to be more

806
00:50:52,401 --> 00:50:56,690
rationalist than the ones in
medieval Europe. So you get very,

807
00:50:56,720 --> 00:51:00,560
you very commonly got the idea that
you wind up with the same truth through

808
00:51:00,561 --> 00:51:05,561
revelation or reason and they kind of
agree and there wasn't really much that

809
00:51:05,571 --> 00:51:08,720
revelation will tell you that you wouldn't
already have known through philosophy.

810
00:51:09,050 --> 00:51:11,630
I mean maybe like how many times a
day you should pray or something,

811
00:51:11,631 --> 00:51:15,140
you wouldn't be able to figure that out,
but that God exists what God is like,

812
00:51:15,141 --> 00:51:18,920
what his relationship to the universe
is like, what our soul is like,

813
00:51:19,310 --> 00:51:21,260
what virtue is Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah.

814
00:51:21,261 --> 00:51:24,230
This is all something they think they
can get through the Greek inspired

815
00:51:24,231 --> 00:51:25,400
philosophical sources.

816
00:51:29,300 --> 00:51:30,260
Yup.
Well with it.

817
00:51:37,060 --> 00:51:39,850
Hm. I'm wondering if there are any, um,

818
00:51:40,020 --> 00:51:43,620
Islamic world based researchers,

819
00:51:43,621 --> 00:51:48,621
philosophers that are writing about the
history of philosophy in Islamic world,

820
00:51:48,810 --> 00:51:51,390
because if you consider
yourself slightly western,

821
00:51:51,450 --> 00:51:54,330
are there any biases that
you think you might have?

822
00:51:54,920 --> 00:51:59,790
No doubt. Yeah. Um, yes,
definitely. And in fact,

823
00:52:00,210 --> 00:52:04,860
one of the things,
so actually if we go back to my list,

824
00:52:05,980 --> 00:52:07,020
um,
this guy,

825
00:52:07,170 --> 00:52:11,910
the fifth one on the list and Melissa
data is still seen in Iran as a very major

826
00:52:11,911 --> 00:52:16,200
thinker who's, uh, continues
to be studied seriously,

827
00:52:16,201 --> 00:52:17,700
not as a kind of historical figure,

828
00:52:17,701 --> 00:52:22,350
but as a serious source of
philosophical inspiration in Iran,

829
00:52:22,590 --> 00:52:26,880
not so much in other parts of
the Islamic world. Um, I mean,

830
00:52:26,881 --> 00:52:29,850
the situation in the Islamic world is
very complicated as you might imagine.

831
00:52:29,851 --> 00:52:33,560
There's a lot of different cultures
and countries with different university

832
00:52:33,561 --> 00:52:35,460
systems and so on.
Um,

833
00:52:35,490 --> 00:52:39,990
but certainly there are many universities
and the Islamic world where they teach

834
00:52:40,290 --> 00:52:44,460
column and philosophy and maybe
as two separate disciplines.

835
00:52:44,870 --> 00:52:48,360
Um, and they do do a history of
philosophy. However, they all, of course,

836
00:52:48,361 --> 00:52:50,460
they're also very interested
in European philosophy.

837
00:52:50,730 --> 00:52:55,730
So one of the things that has happened
since the late 19th century is that

838
00:52:57,600 --> 00:52:59,040
European ideas,

839
00:52:59,070 --> 00:53:03,750
philosophical as well as scientific
ideas obviously have been. Um,

840
00:53:04,350 --> 00:53:07,650
I mean actually there's kind of permanent
engagements between the Islamic world

841
00:53:07,651 --> 00:53:11,210
and European thought, but,
but specifically European
philosophy. Like Satan,

842
00:53:11,220 --> 00:53:13,290
Marxism for example,

843
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:17,580
has played a major role in generating
many of the political movements in the,

844
00:53:17,581 --> 00:53:21,360
that we've seen in the Islamic world over
the last century, century and a half.

845
00:53:21,780 --> 00:53:23,400
And that continues to be the case.

846
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:28,700
So historians of philosophy
there obviously pay more
attention to the history of

847
00:53:29,461 --> 00:53:30,840
Islamic philosophy than we do,

848
00:53:31,410 --> 00:53:35,310
but they pay a lot of attention to the
history of European philosophy as well.

849
00:53:35,850 --> 00:53:36,683
Um,

850
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:40,470
something I'm not so sure about is whether
you'd find very many people there who

851
00:53:40,471 --> 00:53:44,420
say, Oh, I'm just a historian,
which is kind of my, anyway,

852
00:53:44,460 --> 00:53:49,080
that's my bias is this sort of pretense
of neutrality and like I'm a blank and

853
00:53:49,081 --> 00:53:53,730
I'm just telling you what they thoughts
and I have no presuppositions or

854
00:53:53,731 --> 00:53:57,480
philosophical bias. He's of my
own, which of course can't be true,

855
00:53:57,930 --> 00:54:01,260
but sort of by definition I can't
tell you about the biases I have,

856
00:54:01,261 --> 00:54:05,130
I'm not aware of. So what I'm trying
to do is be a kind of neutral.

857
00:54:05,490 --> 00:54:10,490
I'm completely open minded interpreter
who is interested in everything and just

858
00:54:12,751 --> 00:54:16,880
wants to explain it in as clear a
way as possible. That's my goal. Um,

859
00:54:17,670 --> 00:54:22,670
but obviously I w I admit that I
can't possibly be attaining that,

860
00:54:22,891 --> 00:54:24,090
but that's what I'm striving to do.

861
00:54:24,390 --> 00:54:29,390
And I'm not sure you'd find too many
thinkers actually here or there who have

862
00:54:30,271 --> 00:54:33,120
that sort of purely historical approach.
I mean,

863
00:54:33,150 --> 00:54:34,680
most historians of philosophy wouldn't,

864
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:37,800
wouldn't readily admit
to that in Europe either.

865
00:54:38,340 --> 00:54:41,520
So it's kind of an unusual stance.

866
00:54:42,810 --> 00:54:46,260
We are unfortunately out of time.
Thank you very much. Thanks for coming.
