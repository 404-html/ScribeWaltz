1
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:09,723
Yeah,

2
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:15,540
it is a delight to be here at Tech Mecca
talking with you all about this very

3
00:00:16,991 --> 00:00:19,130
important question. Um, uh,

4
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:24,670
a question that is simple, huge, soulful,

5
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:28,510
strictly scientific techie
meaning of life size.

6
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:31,930
And it's a question that
we ignore, shirk, skirt,

7
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:36,810
ridicule and pretend we've
answered when we haven't, uh,

8
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:40,430
fold. Family friend and I were
catching up with each other and um,

9
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:45,420
he asked me what I've been up to and I
described the question to him and um,

10
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:48,270
he balked in a telling way. He said, uh,

11
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:51,180
it sounds like you've got way
too much time on your hands. Uh,

12
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:53,860
it's way over my pay scale.

13
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:57,280
It's a question that
can never be answered.

14
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:02,820
And it was answered last week in a
Facebook post about quantum consciousness.

15
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:08,350
So I got all four of them from him
at once. It is a simple question,

16
00:01:08,351 --> 00:01:10,840
much simpler than any of the
things that you deal with.

17
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:13,540
And yet it is a fairly
unfamiliar question.

18
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:16,000
People do tend to balk at this question.

19
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:20,110
So the way I'm going to do this is I'm
going to frame the question and then

20
00:01:20,111 --> 00:01:22,900
pause for challenges.
Kicked the tires on this thing.

21
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:26,680
Really try to get clear on the
question, challenges, questions,

22
00:01:26,681 --> 00:01:29,380
all of that and then give
you a new proposed answer,

23
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:32,530
which is unlike anything
I've seen from other sources.

24
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:37,740
The question is what are striving selves?
I strived,

25
00:01:37,741 --> 00:01:40,090
therefore I am, you know, Descartes
said, I think therefore I am,

26
00:01:40,091 --> 00:01:43,960
I'm going to go much deeper than
that. I strive, I try, I make effort.

27
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:47,920
This doesn't make effort. Computers
don't actually make effort. They do work,

28
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:51,610
they do very useful work, but they don't
make effort. They don't, not striving.

29
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:54,070
And I'll be more specific
about that in a minute,

30
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:59,590
but you can call us any number of
things. An agent, organism living,

31
00:01:59,591 --> 00:02:03,640
being on, I'm just going to call ourselves
and I'm going to call us all selves,

32
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:06,880
that every one of these
organisms is striving.

33
00:02:06,881 --> 00:02:10,390
It is doing work for its own benefit.

34
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:15,920
Striving means not going with the flow.
And you can see that here in this, uh,

35
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:17,890
self,
um,

36
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:21,700
going upstream and it's,

37
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,410
it's more than this.

38
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:27,970
It's more than just going upstream
because really what's going on is we are

39
00:02:27,971 --> 00:02:30,310
going against the flow
towards the degeneration,

40
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:32,680
everything falling towards entropy,

41
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:37,600
randomness disorder falling apart
and petering out. So very simple,

42
00:02:37,601 --> 00:02:40,420
straightforward question.
We don't,

43
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:45,490
we run to stay in place like the Red
Queen in Alice through the looking glass

44
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:50,350
and it's happening right now unconsciously
and unfelt striving like what our

45
00:02:50,351 --> 00:02:51,640
bodies are doing right now.

46
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:56,170
Right now my body is regenerating itself
faster than it degenerates and it's

47
00:02:56,171 --> 00:03:00,220
doing it without me understanding what
it's doing or any awareness of it.

48
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:04,480
Just like it doesn't bacteria that is,
they don't have consciousness,

49
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:08,710
they don't have feelings and yet they
are striving against the tendency to

50
00:03:08,711 --> 00:03:09,544
degenerate.

51
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,780
So really we can distinguish
between two kinds of things.

52
00:03:13,781 --> 00:03:17,500
The things that exist lasting as they
degenerate depending on their durability

53
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:20,980
and selves, which persists.
Striving to regenerate.

54
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:26,530
Very big difference as yet unexplained
by the sciences. That's the question.

55
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:30,400
And as I said,
machines are not striving selves.

56
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:32,560
We engineer them for durability.

57
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:36,490
Computers aren't striving cells and
striving cells are not computers.

58
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:41,410
I adore computers. I live on them.
I'm spend most of my time on them.

59
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:42,970
There's not a luddite talking.

60
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:48,070
I'm not protesting against the use of
computers as low. They are heartless. No,

61
00:03:48,071 --> 00:03:51,970
I think they're full of heart the way
I use them. But they are not striving.

62
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,480
So the question comes down to this,

63
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:59,590
there's no magic added and yet
selves are means to end striving,

64
00:03:59,591 --> 00:04:01,240
not just cause and effect mechanism.

65
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:05,260
There's something different about
us from nothing but chemistry.

66
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:10,310
So I rule out from the start the idea
that there's some magic nom thing thing

67
00:04:10,311 --> 00:04:13,760
either gets to deposit into matter
that makes us come alive or soul,

68
00:04:13,761 --> 00:04:15,790
the spirit of vital force or any of that.

69
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,220
None of that will work
nor will the argument.

70
00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:22,300
But there's something about all
interactions, all material interactions,

71
00:04:22,301 --> 00:04:23,021
all cause effect.

72
00:04:23,021 --> 00:04:25,570
That's actually a little bit means to
ends and you collected enough of that up

73
00:04:25,571 --> 00:04:29,950
together and suddenly poof, poof.
It's a suddenly a striving self. No,

74
00:04:29,951 --> 00:04:31,570
I'm ruling all of that out.

75
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:35,080
And also I'm ruling out the argument
that all we are is cause and effect

76
00:04:35,081 --> 00:04:38,530
mechanism, which really does
corner with us with a challenge.

77
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:40,390
What are striving selves.

78
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:44,260
There's a fundamental gap in our research.

79
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:49,000
Scientific research striving selves are
inadmissible in the physical sciences.

80
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:53,290
If you had a physics professor who told
you that the moon strives to pull on the

81
00:04:53,291 --> 00:04:57,370
tides for someone's benefit,
you'd think there's something wrong.

82
00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:02,580
But down the hall you've got a biologist
or a social scientist who can talk all

83
00:05:03,071 --> 00:05:06,940
they want about striving selves.
So there's this fundamental rift.

84
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:11,680
Take these three terms,
absolutely essential in biology.

85
00:05:11,681 --> 00:05:14,050
You cannot do biology without functional.

86
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:17,350
Basically function
fittedness and striving.

87
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:19,810
That's about selves.

88
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,870
That's about selves engaging in
what I'll call self directed work,

89
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:27,610
effort by selves for themselves,
responsive to their circumstances.

90
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:31,780
Now the way it works for continuity in
the sciences is that the lower level

91
00:05:31,781 --> 00:05:36,781
scientists have to explain what the higher
sciences assume and we got a huge gap

92
00:05:37,451 --> 00:05:38,170
here.

93
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:43,170
There's chemistry does not
explain functional fitted
striving and yet we totally

94
00:05:43,181 --> 00:05:45,430
rely on it in the life
and social sciences.

95
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,070
Okay,

96
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:51,180
so approach I'm going to propose
promote is that you start with strivings

97
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:54,570
patient zero,
the very first striving self.

98
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:58,520
You have to explain how
mattering could ever from matter,

99
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,990
how you ever get from chemistry to
even the most basic striving self.

100
00:06:02,991 --> 00:06:03,920
And if you do that,

101
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:08,810
you get to reveal the bare essentials
without all of the best bells and whistles

102
00:06:08,811 --> 00:06:12,260
that accumulate through evolutionary
history. You start simple.

103
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:15,380
That is not how we tend to do it. We
tend to do it through cognitive science,

104
00:06:15,381 --> 00:06:17,090
which starts way too high up.

105
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:20,480
It's like trying to
explain hair from quills,

106
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:24,920
porcupine quills they are
hair consciousness is very,

107
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:26,420
uh,
it's,

108
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:31,600
it's very much a striving selves
property just like quills are like hair,

109
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:37,490
but it's very specialized and it's
highly evolved and it's also a little bit

110
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:41,150
cognitive science like trying to explain,
striving,

111
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:42,800
starting with wigs,

112
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:48,250
which is an artifact or computer as an
artifact by which we can try to determine

113
00:06:48,951 --> 00:06:53,210
what it is about us that
is striving. Um, you,

114
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:56,180
you've probably heard of the hard
problem in consciousness studies,

115
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:59,930
which is how do you ever get quality
of the experience, the feeling,

116
00:06:59,931 --> 00:07:01,520
the sensation of things.

117
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:06,710
But cognitive science works from a
computational model for what living is.

118
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:09,050
So I consider it the made harder problem.

119
00:07:09,051 --> 00:07:10,700
If you're gonna try to
go from computation,

120
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:14,070
which is not striving to do anything
and he goes straight to quality,

121
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:17,960
you're going to have problems. That's
why I suggest we start with patient zero.

122
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:21,950
That is with the very first
possible striving self.

123
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:26,510
And I'll say this is a question behind
our biggest questions to reckon with

124
00:07:26,511 --> 00:07:30,620
consciousness, mind, quality of
freewill, morality, mortality,

125
00:07:30,621 --> 00:07:33,980
spirituality, uh, astrobiology et cetera.

126
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:37,820
Start by explaining how the first
striving self could emerge from chemistry.

127
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:43,040
So here's a mystery laid
out. Um, we've got names,

128
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:47,420
we've got names for what selves
are for their properties,

129
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:48,440
for their behaviors.

130
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:53,440
We've got nouns and adjectives and verbs
and they all remain as yet unexplained

131
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:58,730
by these terms from the physical sciences.
So you could call us organisms,

132
00:07:58,731 --> 00:08:02,510
subjects, agents, individuals,
living beings, creatures,

133
00:08:02,511 --> 00:08:04,310
you can even call a spirits or souls.

134
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:07,190
It doesn't actually
matter what we call them.

135
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:10,640
These are names that flag
what has yet to be explained.

136
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:14,570
They just are markers that we use to say,

137
00:08:14,571 --> 00:08:17,300
this is something we have yet to explain.
Um,

138
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,720
and you've got all of these properties
and all of these behaviors as yet

139
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:25,250
unexplained in the physical sciences
saying that you are striving self is no

140
00:08:25,251 --> 00:08:29,210
more a scientific explanation
then saying you have a soul.

141
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:32,660
Both of them are just markers.
So naming is not explaining.

142
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:38,690
Here are some solutions that we often
move towards since we have this gap and it

143
00:08:38,691 --> 00:08:42,380
goes on explained and um,
I'm going to suggest that they don't work.

144
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:44,270
Natural selection.

145
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:49,280
Just an idea out there that there's
the universe was rolling along with its

146
00:08:49,281 --> 00:08:53,420
natural laws and then suddenly a new one
enter is called natural selection and

147
00:08:53,421 --> 00:08:56,490
suddenly it gives rise to organisms,
doesn't work.

148
00:08:56,491 --> 00:08:59,010
Natural selection is actually
natural degeneration.

149
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:01,530
Itselves failing to self regenerate.

150
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:06,740
It explains the honing not what not
what's honed to say that natural,

151
00:09:06,741 --> 00:09:11,741
it's a selection explains life is like
saying that erosion explains mountains.

152
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:15,300
Yeah. Explains how they're
sculpted but not what they are.

153
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,600
So I want to say natural
selection doesn't start life.

154
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:20,730
Life starts natural selection.

155
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:25,290
You actually have to have striving selves
before you have evolution as we think

156
00:09:25,291 --> 00:09:26,124
of it.

157
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:31,330
Another idea is molecular replication
in particular RNA molecules because they

158
00:09:31,331 --> 00:09:33,460
are so important to us organisms now.

159
00:09:33,461 --> 00:09:36,310
But the idea is that you would
get molecular replication.

160
00:09:36,311 --> 00:09:40,390
What you've got here are examples of
molecules not being created from scratch.

161
00:09:40,391 --> 00:09:43,270
It's conservation of matter,
it's transforming of molecules.

162
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:47,830
So you get these molecules, um, going
through their chemical reactions,

163
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:51,040
but the chemical reactions
can appear to strive.

164
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:56,080
But then so can anything a river can look
like it's striving to get to the sea.

165
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:59,950
And actually chemical reactions like
that are just going with the flow.

166
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:04,390
So this idea that molecular replication
somehow solves the problem will not do.

167
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:08,590
And the energy gradients degenerate first.
They paid her out.

168
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:11,410
You saw that in these two
examples I just gave you.

169
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:15,460
But the material order can remain
the generating more slowly.

170
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:18,310
It's still not striving selves.

171
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:23,870
How about jeans?
Jeans,

172
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:27,530
sometimes it's used for the molecules
themselves as if a DNA molecule is a gene.

173
00:10:27,531 --> 00:10:30,350
But mostly what we mean by this
is sequences within the genes.

174
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:34,340
Sequences are not striving selves,
but interpreted by them.

175
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:38,370
DNA, if you lay it on
table, is his lifeless.

176
00:10:38,371 --> 00:10:42,050
So to argue that it's the secret of
life seems to be missing something.

177
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:45,890
It's not this magical molecules. It's
sometimes to pick that the secret to life.

178
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:48,020
So little like saying the text,

179
00:10:48,021 --> 00:10:50,420
which is also a sequence is
striving to tell you something.

180
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:54,320
Another striving self is telling you
something with their text but the text

181
00:10:54,321 --> 00:10:59,260
itself is not actually striving
to tell you anything. Um,

182
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:03,440
or the alternative which is that it's
just cause and effect relationships as if

183
00:11:03,441 --> 00:11:08,420
the sequence, the genetic code which
yields a one to one correspondence.

184
00:11:08,421 --> 00:11:12,920
A code is, is a material cause and
effect process is somehow all there is,

185
00:11:12,921 --> 00:11:17,330
which is another popular notion about it.
Want to be clear on this.

186
00:11:17,331 --> 00:11:20,990
One of the places where we get messed up
on this and in the scientists and also

187
00:11:20,991 --> 00:11:23,780
in philosophy is to treat
it all as causality.

188
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:26,390
Interpretation is not causality.

189
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:29,990
A stop sign doesn't cause you to
stop unless you crash into it.

190
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:34,070
We stopped because we interpreted,
given our strivings,

191
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:36,410
that's about traffic for our benefit.

192
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:40,820
So interpretation is radically
different from cause and effect.

193
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:42,100
Okay.

194
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:43,930
Complexity reason.

195
00:11:43,931 --> 00:11:47,440
I have a frog on the cover of my book
is that in the book I pose the question,

196
00:11:47,441 --> 00:11:50,560
which is more complex,
a frog or a frog smoothie.

197
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:54,280
Now technically a frog
smoothie more complex,

198
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:58,540
there's poor correlation and
there's almost no correlation
between the molecules.

199
00:11:58,541 --> 00:12:02,440
Once they're all shaken up,
once they degenerate it with a blender,

200
00:12:02,441 --> 00:12:05,800
but also they would degenerate anyway.
Um,

201
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:10,150
that's actually more complex than the
frog. The frog has more regularities.

202
00:12:10,151 --> 00:12:13,690
It would be easier to describe
which is the metric for complexity.

203
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:17,110
So we often get ambiguous with this.
Um,

204
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:19,360
is it more complex or
just harder to explain?

205
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:23,360
The frog is harder to explain and yet
less complex. It's, it's regularization.

206
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:24,820
It's the orderliness,

207
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:29,170
orderliness within a frog that is so
impressive and so hard to explain.

208
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:34,900
How about Ai? Not Striving but
engineer trained to aid our striving.

209
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:39,310
If you connected a Julian AI super
computers on a sterile planet,

210
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:40,070
what do you get?

211
00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:45,070
You get a sterile planet that is no
quantity of AI by itself is going to yield

212
00:12:45,911 --> 00:12:50,230
you striving selves.
Quantum mechanics,

213
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,300
quantum phenomenon doesn't strive.

214
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:55,540
Striving cells persist of the
classical non quantum level.

215
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:01,060
Like jilted lovers. Many researchers
would rather not discuss it.

216
00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:05,860
The dance around the gap by equivocation
basically talking out both sides of

217
00:13:05,861 --> 00:13:10,720
their mouth. I read these glorious
books by your neighbor. For example,

218
00:13:10,721 --> 00:13:11,590
Robert Sapolsky,

219
00:13:11,591 --> 00:13:15,880
who wrote this wonderful book called
behave all about the biochemistry of

220
00:13:15,881 --> 00:13:16,714
motivation.

221
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:21,280
I love these books and yet they
are still dodging the question.

222
00:13:21,281 --> 00:13:24,070
He'll talk about how a
molecule causes a motivation.

223
00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:28,870
It's not clear how that happens and
he doesn't seem to be addressing it.

224
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:34,600
You get a book like information,
a theory, uh, uh, what is it a a,

225
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:38,350
a history, a theory of flood
by James Gleek wonderful book,

226
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:42,460
which by the end of the claims that
there's information everywhere and has

227
00:13:42,461 --> 00:13:45,070
always been by the end
of the middle section.

228
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:48,790
And then he goes into the last section
about how we're now experiencing a flood

229
00:13:48,791 --> 00:13:51,490
of information,
which is it?

230
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:55,990
Is it always everywhere or is it
something we can experience a flood off?

231
00:13:56,020 --> 00:14:00,520
If we experience a flood of then
apparently we are interpreting it in a

232
00:14:00,521 --> 00:14:01,900
different way than we used to.

233
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:07,320
But the claim that it's all information
is a kind of equivocation information

234
00:14:07,931 --> 00:14:09,380
could be true,
talked about it.

235
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:13,230
So it's just Shannon reductions and
possibilities or as a difference.

236
00:14:13,231 --> 00:14:17,980
It makes a difference for a self
that is striving to stay alive,

237
00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:18,963
to regenerate.

238
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:20,720
Okay.

239
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:24,980
So that's the question and I want
to hear your challenges to it.

240
00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:29,210
I want to hear you really kicked the
tires on this really pushed back if you

241
00:14:29,211 --> 00:14:32,960
have trouble with the question or if I
haven't been clear about the question and

242
00:14:32,961 --> 00:14:36,020
then I'll go on to a new
proposed to answer. Uh,

243
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:39,750
no intentionality would be
a subset of striving. Um,

244
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:44,750
the words get really squirrely in here.
That is a carry a lot of baggage.

245
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:49,340
I'm in my last presentation or bio
semiotics conference, I called it trying,

246
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:53,600
which tends to imply a kind of a
psychological intention, a wheel,

247
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:55,460
a conscious effort.
Um,

248
00:14:56,360 --> 00:15:00,320
so I've ended up gravitating to
striving because for two reasons. One,

249
00:15:00,321 --> 00:15:02,990
it's fairly clean on this
question of ghost and machine.

250
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:04,790
There's a tendency in this research,

251
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:08,810
I think of it like walking a tight
rope line. This question here,

252
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:12,290
because you can fall off into ghost,

253
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:17,420
basically Hmong Cuellar that is you're
anthropomorphizing what goes on or into

254
00:15:17,421 --> 00:15:19,400
machine mechanics causing an effect.

255
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:22,850
So how you ride that is difficult
with the words we've got.

256
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:27,770
There are definitions of intentionality
that would be broad enough that it would

257
00:15:27,771 --> 00:15:31,640
cover what all living beings do.
But that's not the vernacular use of it.

258
00:15:31,641 --> 00:15:36,641
And we usually think of it as something
willed by a conscious feeling being.

259
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:40,610
But yes, it is included in
here. And, and, and by the way,

260
00:15:40,611 --> 00:15:44,360
I am not just striving to regenerate.
I'm striving, for example,

261
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:49,250
to communicate an idea that is by now
humans have all sorts of head room and all

262
00:15:49,251 --> 00:15:51,950
sorts of distractions,
other kinds of intentions.

263
00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:55,760
But if you want to get at patient zero,
you start with the most basic,

264
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:58,520
which is pushing against
this tendency to fall apart.

265
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:00,600
So you mentioned,
uh,

266
00:16:00,601 --> 00:16:04,010
artificial intelligence and the
limitations thereof that you,

267
00:16:04,011 --> 00:16:08,130
you could hook up a large number of
artificial intelligence and machines and

268
00:16:08,131 --> 00:16:11,970
that you would still not get a striving
self out of it. Nicely put. Um,

269
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,590
one of the ways that we
understand artificial
intelligence today is just a whole

270
00:16:16,591 --> 00:16:18,660
bunch of the linear Algebra
and neural networks.

271
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:21,800
And that is very much a calculator.
Are you,

272
00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:26,250
are you saying by that that artificial
intelligence of today could not be

273
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:28,620
constructive? That, or
could it be never? No.

274
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:31,270
Actually saying up today,
and this is an important point,

275
00:16:31,271 --> 00:16:35,170
it's actually my takeaway that is
once you understand patient zero,

276
00:16:35,171 --> 00:16:37,240
you have a new angle on AI,

277
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:40,360
which I wouldn't know about
because I'm not an expert on it.

278
00:16:40,361 --> 00:16:42,310
But I do think there's potential for it.

279
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:45,700
And there's someone in the audience
who's paying close attention to that

280
00:16:45,701 --> 00:16:49,630
potential. Um, and Tom,
right here. There we go.

281
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,840
Yes. Thank you. Yeah. It's just not yet.

282
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:57,250
So are you counting viruses as striving?
We're not. It's a great question.

283
00:16:57,251 --> 00:17:01,870
And I would say yes, but to do that,
I can't just work from impressions.

284
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:05,770
I have to give an argument for that. So
it's a difficult argument and debatable.

285
00:17:05,771 --> 00:17:09,850
It's not, it's not altogether clear. The
model. I will give you four patients.

286
00:17:09,851 --> 00:17:14,851
Zero is like a non
parasitic virus without DNA.

287
00:17:14,951 --> 00:17:19,720
It's really gotta be simple and yet not
impressionistic to do it. So it's uh,

288
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:23,470
but, but yes, there is something
about them that does seem,

289
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:28,210
we talked this back and forth,
me and this guy, uh, colleagues,

290
00:17:28,211 --> 00:17:29,470
including John and Anton,

291
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:33,130
we explore this and wonder about
whether viruses count or not,

292
00:17:33,131 --> 00:17:35,590
but we think they probably do.
Yes.

293
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:39,330
So regarding your slide on jeans,
yes.

294
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:42,870
How would you respond to
the idea that, um, uh,

295
00:17:42,871 --> 00:17:47,871
chicken is an egg's way of making another
egg and that it's not the DNA that is

296
00:17:48,451 --> 00:17:50,010
the striving,
but rather

297
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:53,640
the coupled system between
a ribosome and the RNA?

298
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:57,650
Well, even still, if you
put robbers on an hour,

299
00:17:57,650 --> 00:18:02,240
hour and a naked on a table, um,
they're not going to be striving self.

300
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:05,030
So there's wood, but, but
you're onto something.

301
00:18:05,031 --> 00:18:09,400
One of the things that life has to
do is it has to replicate. Um, and I,

302
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:11,720
it has to reproduce.
I use,

303
00:18:11,721 --> 00:18:14,750
we produce rather than replicate because
replicating the kind of thing you can

304
00:18:14,751 --> 00:18:18,740
do, um, without paying attention
to the work involved. You know,

305
00:18:18,741 --> 00:18:21,590
those chemicals we're
replicating in effect over there.

306
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:26,450
No reproducing takes work. So we have to
explain the work themselves. Do you know,

307
00:18:26,451 --> 00:18:31,130
we'd go back and forth between saying
I have this body and I am this body.

308
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:34,040
I'm going to argue that
what I am isn't my body.

309
00:18:34,041 --> 00:18:36,320
The body remains there after I'm dead.

310
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:40,820
It's still all right there and the energy
of the material of the organization

311
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:41,870
and yet I'm gone.

312
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:47,150
So I have to be able to explain
that and not resort to Phantoms,

313
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:49,130
not resort to ghost.
This is the challenge.

314
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:52,820
This is what I'm going to try to do
in this next little bit. Um, but yes,

315
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:58,120
you take a sequence or you take a
coding process extracted from biology,

316
00:18:58,221 --> 00:19:01,310
it's not the striving self either.
It just got to keep on.

317
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:03,910
It's a process of elimination saying,
well,

318
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:06,620
and that's basically what I was going
through with those solutions that don't,

319
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:10,430
each of those have been tempting and
I'm arguing each of those. Don't cut it.

320
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:13,670
Okay. So let's say you have
a very simple organism,

321
00:19:13,671 --> 00:19:17,990
like a non parasitic virus that
you mentioned, which is a striving,

322
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:19,190
uh,

323
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:23,540
now if we could simulate that
with sufficient fidelity,

324
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:26,210
would dissimulation then be striving.

325
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:30,660
Uh, I'm delighted you bring that
up. I want to propose a, uh,

326
00:19:30,661 --> 00:19:33,430
a contrast between
simulation and emulation.

327
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:37,320
Simulation is done with cause and effect,
uh,

328
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:42,970
formalisms schematics, that sort of thing.
Basically Arrows and pointers, you know,

329
00:19:42,971 --> 00:19:45,580
moving from node to node
by my version of it.

330
00:19:45,581 --> 00:19:50,581
That is you are modeling the consequences
of some behavior emulating would be

331
00:19:51,071 --> 00:19:54,970
actually showing how the behavior works.

332
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:57,170
And it's different from modeling it.

333
00:19:57,610 --> 00:20:00,190
And I'm going to give you an example
of the slide two slides after.

334
00:20:00,191 --> 00:20:05,191
This is going to be Anton's emulation
of the process I'm describing.

335
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:10,600
If you can emulate it. Yes, you're well
along to being able to understand it,

336
00:20:10,601 --> 00:20:13,620
but you have to work with the world as
it is and it's not a bunch of cause.

337
00:20:13,621 --> 00:20:16,220
An Arrow affair, uh, uh, Co, uh,

338
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:20,770
causing an effect arrows and nodes where
you get to label the node and just talk

339
00:20:20,771 --> 00:20:23,380
about them as pointing this way.
I'll be saying a little bit,

340
00:20:23,381 --> 00:20:25,060
but more about this emulation,

341
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:29,110
I'm going to argue with
something different and
totally achievable at Google.

342
00:20:29,650 --> 00:20:33,410
So that's one of the reasons why I'm
interested in presenting here. Okay.

343
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:35,190
I mean,
well we'll see,

344
00:20:35,191 --> 00:20:38,460
but I don't completely buy the difference
between simulation and emulation.

345
00:20:38,461 --> 00:20:40,600
It's good. Like a good
10. I haven't yet really

346
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:41,440
delivered on it yet.

347
00:20:41,441 --> 00:20:45,730
So let me see what I look forward to your
questions and challenges after. Okay.

348
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:50,560
Okay, thanks. Okay, so
this is Terrence deacon.

349
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:56,080
I had met him, uh, shortly after this
book had come out of the sandbox.

350
00:20:56,081 --> 00:21:00,460
BCC has been 20 years as a neuroscientist
at Harvard trying to on understand the

351
00:21:00,461 --> 00:21:05,080
emergence and consequences
of us having language,

352
00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:08,440
the symbolic species. And he had
just moved on to another question,

353
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:13,090
which culminated in this book in
2011 called incomplete nature.

354
00:21:13,091 --> 00:21:15,600
How mind emerges from matter.
Um,

355
00:21:16,090 --> 00:21:20,020
famously a challenging book to read,
difficult to read.

356
00:21:20,021 --> 00:21:25,021
So my effort is to distill it
and some of this into my book.

357
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,880
Um,
I think of them as a natural philosopher,

358
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:30,460
which is what scientists
were originally called. Um,

359
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:34,660
he's a scientist and yet he's
dealing with philosophical questions,

360
00:21:34,661 --> 00:21:39,430
questions that scientists often don't get
around to like what is a striving self

361
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:44,020
or how does language actually
emerge? Um, he's also,

362
00:21:44,290 --> 00:21:46,910
uh,
a very easy person to talk to.

363
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:49,550
We have a meeting at his house
every couple of weeks. Um,

364
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:54,010
open to whoever is interested.
That's how Anton got involved. No,

365
00:21:54,011 --> 00:21:58,710
Anton Anton actually read,
uh, in incomplete nature
and decided he wanted to ma,

366
00:21:58,790 --> 00:22:02,970
uh, model or emulate, uh, the
process that he proposes in here. Uh,

367
00:22:03,010 --> 00:22:06,280
John also joined up through that,
through that meeting.

368
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:10,540
We just get together and explore this
stuff. Um, it's delightful. It's easy.

369
00:22:10,570 --> 00:22:14,830
It's apolitical. The guys never
pulled rank on me in 21 years.

370
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:18,690
We just talk. We work on the
problems. It's a delight. Um,

371
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,860
so here's the question.
As I posed it before,

372
00:22:20,861 --> 00:22:24,640
striving selves are something different
from nothing but chemistry. What?

373
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:26,290
Starting with patient zero.

374
00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:30,400
And here I'm going to give you a
grotesquely simplified solution.

375
00:22:30,401 --> 00:22:33,010
It's a chain reaction that
generates chain reaction seeds.

376
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,390
I'm not sure the Terry would like that,
but it gets at it.

377
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:41,560
And here is Anton's beginnings
of the emulation of it.

378
00:22:41,561 --> 00:22:45,540
That is he's imagining a chain reaction.
Um,

379
00:22:45,730 --> 00:22:49,240
he's modeling a chain reaction with all
of the stochastics involved and these

380
00:22:49,241 --> 00:22:51,710
seeds forming along the way.
Um,

381
00:22:51,850 --> 00:22:56,560
they are color coded to represent there
in effect viability and this is very

382
00:22:56,561 --> 00:23:01,150
early days for this research, but
he sees this as a possibility. Um,

383
00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:02,103
we,
uh,

384
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:07,140
for how we can get at the narrowing in
on the kinds of molecules that might have

385
00:23:07,331 --> 00:23:10,450
made this process power possible.
You'll notice it.

386
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:14,830
I said that these were something
like non parasitic viruses,

387
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:16,870
but there's no DNA in these things.

388
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:21,400
The reading of sequences in the
service service of your striving,

389
00:23:21,401 --> 00:23:25,630
it's not the kind of thing you can imagine
easily coming about spontaneously out

390
00:23:25,631 --> 00:23:27,820
of chemistry.
It's a very complicated process.

391
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:30,580
Terry has a model for
how we could get there,

392
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:33,700
but we're starting simpler than that.
And as I said,

393
00:23:33,701 --> 00:23:36,940
simple but not impressionistic.
Okay.

394
00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:39,790
Now let me back up and
tell you how I got there,

395
00:23:39,791 --> 00:23:42,550
how we get there to your two don'ts.

396
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:46,550
Basically your experience of life,
you focus rather than dithering.

397
00:23:46,850 --> 00:23:50,210
You could've done dozens of other
things right now during your hour here,

398
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:52,200
but you chose to be here.
Um,

399
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:56,210
and you're not just everywhere
you're doing focused work.

400
00:23:56,211 --> 00:23:58,190
Your focus is a product of self control.

401
00:23:58,191 --> 00:24:02,540
Everything you prevent yourself from
doing consciously and unconsciously and

402
00:24:02,541 --> 00:24:06,500
above all, you focus on preventing the
degeneration of your ability to focus.

403
00:24:06,501 --> 00:24:10,370
So I'm going to be arguing that you are
a prevention that prevents itself from

404
00:24:10,371 --> 00:24:11,204
ending.

405
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:15,800
It's a process of elimination logic,

406
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:19,060
very different from the Arrow kind
of logic we use in schematics and

407
00:24:19,061 --> 00:24:23,990
formalization. Um, and it's the insight
behind a lot of very big breakthroughs.

408
00:24:24,650 --> 00:24:26,510
Um,
pay attention to what's eliminated.

409
00:24:26,511 --> 00:24:28,490
Darwin natural selection
to explain fitness,

410
00:24:28,491 --> 00:24:31,010
attend to the non survival of the unfit.

411
00:24:31,490 --> 00:24:35,630
Shannon signal theory to explain signals
sent, attend to signals not sent.

412
00:24:36,890 --> 00:24:41,890
Ashby h Ross Ashby who coined the term
self organization to explain increased

413
00:24:41,931 --> 00:24:45,560
order.
Attend to emergent constraint on disorder.

414
00:24:45,561 --> 00:24:47,570
I'm a have to say more
about emerging constraint.

415
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,220
Here are two quotes from him that I like.

416
00:24:49,221 --> 00:24:53,660
A lot of self organizing system
spontaneously reduces the number of its

417
00:24:53,661 --> 00:24:57,830
potential states. Observe what
might have happened, but did not.

418
00:24:59,630 --> 00:25:01,790
Here's an example,
an intuitive example of it,

419
00:25:01,791 --> 00:25:05,720
the threading through a crowd and
others threading around you. Um, uh,

420
00:25:05,930 --> 00:25:10,930
you'll get these strings of people who
are taking the path of least resistance

421
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:14,570
that emerged by a process
of path elimination.

422
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:18,540
Now these are striving selves,
so it doesn't really count, uh,

423
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:21,620
if we want to look for patient zero.
But there are of course,

424
00:25:21,621 --> 00:25:24,770
plenty of nonliving self
organization processes.

425
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:27,530
Now the term self
organization is problematic.

426
00:25:27,531 --> 00:25:30,560
We were talking a minute ago about
problematic terms like intention.

427
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:34,850
It suggests a self trying to organize it
and there are plenty of people who have

428
00:25:34,851 --> 00:25:36,080
moved in that direction.

429
00:25:36,530 --> 00:25:40,430
Talking as though if you just get
self organization going and it gets

430
00:25:40,431 --> 00:25:43,670
complicated enough, then you've
got to striving self. Um,

431
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:47,720
I actually call it emergent
regularization. It's a constraint process.

432
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:51,200
And whirlpools are an example.
Auto Assembly,

433
00:25:51,201 --> 00:25:55,100
like a crystal formation and auto
ketalysis about which I'll say more now

434
00:25:55,101 --> 00:25:57,140
because they're essential to our model.

435
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:00,920
I don't want assembly is
basically crystal formation,

436
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:04,730
but all sorts of other processes as well.
Lipid membranes for example,

437
00:26:04,731 --> 00:26:08,900
which are bubbles. Um, uh, or
capsules which will be crucial here.

438
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:12,770
They're like viral shells. They're
not actually constructed deliberately.

439
00:26:12,771 --> 00:26:14,270
They're not part of the striving process.

440
00:26:14,271 --> 00:26:16,490
They actually fall together
just like crystals do.

441
00:26:16,790 --> 00:26:21,170
They fall to resting states and the
resting states given their complimentary

442
00:26:21,171 --> 00:26:26,000
molecular geometry, um, will
yield you regularize sheets,

443
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:28,670
shells and tubes.
So these are very exciting.

444
00:26:28,671 --> 00:26:30,830
Remember we're trying to
figure out how you get,

445
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:34,910
how to explain the frog while
the frog is full of regularity.

446
00:26:34,911 --> 00:26:37,010
So we might look to this process.

447
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:42,400
Auto assembly as a step towards life
towards striving selves auto could tell us

448
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:49,010
is basically a chain reaction that grows
a population of multiple catalysts that

449
00:26:51,301 --> 00:26:54,030
are all in effect producing each other.

450
00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:57,570
It's a population explosion that grows,

451
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:01,170
depletes the resources that it
depends upon and then dissipates.

452
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:04,920
So if you imagine you've got
these two molecules, x and Y,

453
00:27:04,921 --> 00:27:07,470
and in this super simplification of it,

454
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:10,110
they are both transforming reactance.

455
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:13,230
I didn't get specific about the
reactants into more of each other.

456
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:18,260
An ex transforms an hour into a why and
our why transforms an into an x and you

457
00:27:19,551 --> 00:27:22,350
get this population explosion of xs.
And Ys,

458
00:27:22,351 --> 00:27:27,120
but in the meantime you're depleting
all the r's and you end up with a

459
00:27:27,121 --> 00:27:29,010
dissipation of the molecules.

460
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:31,670
And the thing about this auto
could tell us is is it's,

461
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:35,850
it's more likely to start if you've got
a cluster of the xs and ys to start it.

462
00:27:35,851 --> 00:27:38,010
Yes,
it could start with one x producing one.

463
00:27:38,011 --> 00:27:40,410
Why they wouldn't then produces another x,

464
00:27:40,650 --> 00:27:45,650
but it's way more likely to start if
you've got a cluster of them in close

465
00:27:45,781 --> 00:27:48,790
range. And often with
byproducts, for example,

466
00:27:48,791 --> 00:27:53,791
an x might split an hour into a y and
some other molecule which also be crucial

467
00:27:53,821 --> 00:27:57,960
to this explanation.
A self organization.

468
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:01,590
So like I said, some people think
that self organization is enough.

469
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:03,870
It's a variation on the
complexity argument.

470
00:28:03,871 --> 00:28:08,040
If you get enough of this kind of
emergent regularization self organization,

471
00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:11,550
suddenly it becomes a striving
self. We don't think so. Uh,

472
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:14,790
it goes with the flow towards
overall degeneration and selves.

473
00:28:14,791 --> 00:28:16,350
Don't they strive to regenerate,

474
00:28:17,250 --> 00:28:21,990
but still this concept of emergent
constraints that is reduced possibilities

475
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:26,190
emerging throughout a dynamic
process is of interest to us.

476
00:28:26,191 --> 00:28:29,430
And we think there's a
way to get at the origin,

477
00:28:29,431 --> 00:28:31,860
the the patient zero of
striving self through it.

478
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,950
So just to be clear on
the general principle,

479
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:38,250
the whole is less than the sum
of its parts possibilities.

480
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:42,120
Any of those people threading their way
through the crowd could have moved in a

481
00:28:42,121 --> 00:28:43,440
whole lot more directions,

482
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:47,760
but those directions are reduced through
the congestion and they ended up taking

483
00:28:47,761 --> 00:28:51,600
paths of least resistance at some
probabilities become less likely,

484
00:28:51,601 --> 00:28:56,130
others become more likely.
What's presented is a
product of what's prevented.

485
00:28:56,850 --> 00:29:01,500
And so we got that throughout the sh
the Darwin Shannon Ashby are all playing

486
00:29:01,501 --> 00:29:02,790
with this key insight.

487
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,100
And basically what we're doing
is applying it to this question,

488
00:29:05,101 --> 00:29:09,900
what is the striving cell?
If it's not your body, if
it's not your DNA, ribosomes,

489
00:29:10,170 --> 00:29:11,003
what is it?

490
00:29:12,970 --> 00:29:17,880
So we think of self regeneration
as possibly a higher level
emergent constraints.

491
00:29:17,881 --> 00:29:22,300
So we've come up with a testable
hypothesis for how coupled self organizing

492
00:29:22,301 --> 00:29:26,260
processes could prevent each other
from ending. And like I'd said,

493
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:30,970
it has to be simple and yet not
impressionistic. I don't get to say,

494
00:29:30,971 --> 00:29:32,470
well that looks like it's striving.

495
00:29:32,471 --> 00:29:37,330
It actually has to be doing work on its
own behalf, fit to its own environment.

496
00:29:38,690 --> 00:29:39,320
Okay.

497
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:42,460
Requirements for self generation. Very
basic. If you, if you're thinking about,

498
00:29:42,461 --> 00:29:46,480
okay, uh, everything's degenerating, how
would you keep yourself from degenerating?

499
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:48,430
You'd need self-repair regenerating,

500
00:29:48,431 --> 00:29:52,650
whatever degenerates you'd
need self protection that
is preventing to generation

501
00:29:53,050 --> 00:29:56,260
and you'd need self reproduction
because eventually you will degenerate.

502
00:29:56,261 --> 00:30:01,261
And you need lineages of a self
regenerating striving selves that have the

503
00:30:03,341 --> 00:30:06,400
capacity to self repair and self protect.
And out of these three,

504
00:30:06,401 --> 00:30:09,070
you end up with this
interesting challenge. Um,

505
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:12,550
what I'll call selective
interaction. Uh, we all deal with it,

506
00:30:12,910 --> 00:30:14,650
but it had to be there
at the beginning of life.

507
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:18,010
That is in order to do any
of this generative work,

508
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:22,390
you need to take in energy and
resources and put out waste products.

509
00:30:22,450 --> 00:30:25,540
And at the same time to prevent the
generation, you have to not do that.

510
00:30:25,541 --> 00:30:28,240
So you've got this going on
from the origins of life.

511
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:32,290
And that's a challenge for origins
of life research because um,

512
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:37,060
the kinds of selective membranes that we
all rely on that led in some stuff and

513
00:30:37,061 --> 00:30:39,160
not others,
pores and orifice was and all that,

514
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:41,110
you're not going to get that by chance.

515
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:43,990
Just a lucky chance that
lets in all the right stuff.

516
00:30:43,991 --> 00:30:47,530
Let's out all the right stuff
doesn't let in all the wrong stuff,

517
00:30:47,531 --> 00:30:49,090
doesn't let in all the wrong stuff.

518
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:54,540
That is a origins of life theory and
origins of striving cells has to be

519
00:30:55,210 --> 00:31:00,160
striving successfully
outpacing the tendency to
degenerate from day one that it

520
00:31:00,161 --> 00:31:04,930
has to be able to do that. And this is a
challenge to select of indirection. Hey,

521
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:06,340
by the way,
you're still doing all of this.

522
00:31:06,341 --> 00:31:09,220
Obviously self-repair you're
striving to keep fit and healthy.

523
00:31:09,310 --> 00:31:13,810
Sometimes consciously, sometimes
not consciously. Um, uh,

524
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:14,830
self protection.

525
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:17,800
You're regenerating skin staying
closed with a roof over your head.

526
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:21,370
Self reproduction kids may
be and selective interaction
which has gotten very

527
00:31:21,371 --> 00:31:25,470
elaborate for human beings as a little
taste of it in this room right now I'm a

528
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:29,950
suggesting something that you can either
absorb or avoid. People do all the time.

529
00:31:29,951 --> 00:31:33,800
We're always trying to figure out what
to take in and what not to take in. Um,

530
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:38,710
at many levels from you can say the
immune system to our mouth. All of this,

531
00:31:38,770 --> 00:31:40,150
all of it's still going on.

532
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:46,060
So here finally is that model that we
show that I mentioned early on and we got

533
00:31:46,061 --> 00:31:48,190
the emulation of it from Anton.

534
00:31:48,430 --> 00:31:51,190
Here it is the auto gen
meaning the self regenerator.

535
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:57,610
Imagine you've got one of those chain
reaction process is the auto metalysis but

536
00:31:57,611 --> 00:32:00,310
it's by product happens to be
one of those caps had molecules.

537
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:04,060
So while it's chain reacting in
the midst of that chain reaction,

538
00:32:04,270 --> 00:32:08,920
it's putting out molecules that will form
the equivalent of virus of Shell's not

539
00:32:08,921 --> 00:32:11,560
trying to form them, they just
formed, they fall together.

540
00:32:11,650 --> 00:32:13,240
That's the auto assembly.

541
00:32:13,690 --> 00:32:17,230
So you've got a complementary charity
between the two where you get a chain

542
00:32:17,231 --> 00:32:18,560
reaction.
Um,

543
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:21,970
and then you've got these shells that
encapsulate what I called starter kits or

544
00:32:21,971 --> 00:32:26,971
seeds that if they break open and the
presence of more reactants can resume the

545
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:33,530
Orica Telesis the chain reaction and
resume producing seeds. Okay, so take,

546
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:35,500
let's take a look at this.
You've got the reactants.

547
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:40,520
You've got a cluster of these catalysts
in here. The purple are the capsules.

548
00:32:41,150 --> 00:32:42,110
It breaks open.

549
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:47,680
Let's say a big molecule hits it and
it's got spill out into the reactants,

550
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:50,570
which generates a whole lot more cs,

551
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:53,720
x's and y's that ended up by happenstance,

552
00:32:54,050 --> 00:32:57,650
captured within more of these shells.
That's the seeds or starter kits.

553
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:02,230
Very simple model
is there.

554
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:07,240
Self regeneration well is repairing the
seeds as they degenerate and the capsids

555
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,390
protect against the generation.

556
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:15,880
It generates varied an evolvable
audit, auto, uh, auto gen lineages,

557
00:33:16,090 --> 00:33:18,820
and they're selective
interaction though not quite.

558
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:21,520
It's not actually choosing
when to be opened and closed.

559
00:33:21,521 --> 00:33:23,320
I'll explain how we get there in a minute,

560
00:33:23,530 --> 00:33:28,300
but at least you have an alternation and
the alternation is crucial given that

561
00:33:28,301 --> 00:33:31,240
one of the things that has to fit his
environments where reactants are only

562
00:33:31,241 --> 00:33:33,790
sometimes present,
we think of this thing like a ratchet.

563
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:38,380
It grows for a while and then it
locks down while it's locked down.

564
00:33:38,381 --> 00:33:41,650
It can survive in environments
where there are no reactants.

565
00:33:41,651 --> 00:33:42,311
That's why it's useful.

566
00:33:42,311 --> 00:33:46,240
Dev seeds were starter
kits that are enclosed and
basically static at that point.

567
00:33:47,230 --> 00:33:51,790
So it's functional in that it's self
repairs when broken for its own sake.

568
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:55,210
Remember, here's what good place to
not be thinking about intentionality.

569
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:59,500
It's not trying to, it doesn't
care. Um, it's not conscious.

570
00:33:59,501 --> 00:34:01,510
It's not willing all of that.
And yet we have to,

571
00:34:01,690 --> 00:34:04,870
we have to start at that level if we're
really going to understand that the self

572
00:34:04,871 --> 00:34:09,240
repair benefits, the lineage
of audio autogens, um,

573
00:34:09,370 --> 00:34:12,550
it's fitted as I've mentioned,
it's striving when seeds are broken.

574
00:34:12,551 --> 00:34:16,360
Autogens respond with auto catalytic
work that regenerates seeds.

575
00:34:17,530 --> 00:34:18,360
Okay.

576
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:20,250
Here's an example of how it might evolve.

577
00:34:20,251 --> 00:34:24,990
We argue that at this point you have found
a way to outpace the tendency towards

578
00:34:24,991 --> 00:34:26,790
the generation.
Um,

579
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:28,650
okay.

580
00:34:28,650 --> 00:34:31,920
Breaks open other molecules get into it.

581
00:34:32,550 --> 00:34:36,170
We have discovered a way in which you
can self purge. That is, it will get,

582
00:34:36,180 --> 00:34:40,750
tend to get rid of molecules that don't
facilitate it. It breaks open and uh,

583
00:34:40,770 --> 00:34:43,360
the molecules or copy or the x's and y's,
uh,

584
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:46,320
not the other molecules that are
kind of strays that enter into it.

585
00:34:46,321 --> 00:34:49,270
So there's a little bit of
self purging at this point. Um,

586
00:34:49,410 --> 00:34:53,940
but imagine that you end up not with a
y but a z and the z happens to have a

587
00:34:53,941 --> 00:34:55,040
different by product,

588
00:34:55,290 --> 00:34:59,400
a different caps and molecule that's a
little rougher on the outside and the R

589
00:34:59,401 --> 00:35:00,600
is actually stick to it.

590
00:35:00,810 --> 00:35:04,530
Making the overall seed refer
more likely to break open.

591
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:05,690
Okay

592
00:35:05,690 --> 00:35:10,070
now this is the kind of
thing we can emulate. I'm not
saying this is the answer,

593
00:35:10,071 --> 00:35:14,380
but it does show the kinds of things that
it could evolve and it is big isn't an

594
00:35:14,390 --> 00:35:17,900
attempt to show how from nothing but
physics and chemistry you could actually

595
00:35:17,901 --> 00:35:21,140
get a striving self that would
then have the capacity to evolve.

596
00:35:22,130 --> 00:35:23,150
So when it breaks,

597
00:35:23,390 --> 00:35:27,560
you can see that this one actually begins
to have selective interaction is more

598
00:35:27,561 --> 00:35:31,720
likely to open in the presence
of reactants. Then, uh,

599
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:35,750
in the absence of app of, of reactants.
And then as I mentioned earlier,

600
00:35:35,751 --> 00:35:38,610
we have a model for how you'd
end up with a template molecule.

601
00:35:38,611 --> 00:35:43,611
A molecule like DNA or RNA that has a
sequence that is actually functional for

602
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:49,210
the striving self. But we would
argue, given the complexity of, of,

603
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:52,230
of making use of a sequence,

604
00:35:52,590 --> 00:35:55,710
you really have to start with striving
selves if you're going to get to the

605
00:35:55,711 --> 00:35:59,850
level where you can actually
use DNA or RNA. Okay.

606
00:35:59,851 --> 00:36:02,340
So what's a striving self?
It's not a ghost.

607
00:36:02,341 --> 00:36:04,680
It's not something added to chemistry.
It's not mechanism.

608
00:36:04,681 --> 00:36:07,980
It's not the material energy causing
an effect work or organization.

609
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:11,190
It's a self regenerative
emerging constraint.

610
00:36:11,430 --> 00:36:16,430
A synergistic coupling between two self
organization processes that prevent each

611
00:36:16,621 --> 00:36:17,760
other's degeneration.

612
00:36:19,250 --> 00:36:20,083
Okay.

613
00:36:20,130 --> 00:36:22,380
What is the self then?
What is a striving self?

614
00:36:22,381 --> 00:36:24,660
If you were to work all
the way up to all of us,

615
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:29,880
I would argue that we are a constraint
that channels energy into work that

616
00:36:29,881 --> 00:36:31,350
prevents the constraints,

617
00:36:31,430 --> 00:36:36,430
the generation and that it came about
through a synergy between two self

618
00:36:38,401 --> 00:36:43,080
organizing processes that prevent each
other from ending your whole is less than

619
00:36:43,081 --> 00:36:45,810
the sum of your parts.
Independent possibilities.

620
00:36:46,410 --> 00:36:49,410
So I come back to emerging constraints
because I think it may have the most

621
00:36:49,411 --> 00:36:50,244
application.

622
00:36:50,430 --> 00:36:55,430
And thinking here about how to move AI
and other technologies beyond where we

623
00:36:55,471 --> 00:36:57,360
already are to really push it.
Um,

624
00:36:57,510 --> 00:37:01,710
observe what might have happened but did
not emerge. Regularization as I said,

625
00:37:01,711 --> 00:37:03,800
self organization is go with the flow.

626
00:37:03,830 --> 00:37:07,500
Local temporary generation of
energetic and material regularities.

627
00:37:07,770 --> 00:37:12,720
Emergent self regeneration though is
self striving against the flow to prevent

628
00:37:12,721 --> 00:37:13,770
their own degeneration.

629
00:37:13,950 --> 00:37:17,370
And it happens through this synergistic
coupling where both of them stop the

630
00:37:17,371 --> 00:37:20,840
other from failing auto
ketalysis remember it,

631
00:37:20,870 --> 00:37:22,530
it grows and then dissipates.

632
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:27,680
Well the capsids keep it from losing all
of its potential before it dissipates.

633
00:37:28,590 --> 00:37:31,650
And capstans will break
open and dissipate as well.

634
00:37:31,830 --> 00:37:35,820
But the auto gen replot replenishes
the supply of caps had molecules.

635
00:37:35,821 --> 00:37:37,350
These molecules that form the shells.

636
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:43,540
In general though, there's a
methodological question. Uh, our,

637
00:37:43,541 --> 00:37:48,541
our proposition I want to make a life
isn't schematic or formal like our

638
00:37:48,561 --> 00:37:50,360
engineering and math simulations.

639
00:37:50,570 --> 00:37:54,740
It's running gauntlets selves constraining
possibilities to prevent dime.

640
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:59,240
It's somehow figuring out how any
organism does anything like this,

641
00:37:59,241 --> 00:38:03,230
running through the constraints because
it is fitted to the constraints.

642
00:38:03,590 --> 00:38:08,150
It has internal to itself, uh, a, uh,

643
00:38:08,151 --> 00:38:13,151
an agency that enables it to avoid
all of the risks of the generation.

644
00:38:13,930 --> 00:38:17,750
And in general weeks, I find that
across the fields in philosophy,

645
00:38:18,050 --> 00:38:19,340
in programming,

646
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:22,580
they just across the fields were still
using models that in one way or another

647
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:26,390
and apply a point a to point B.

648
00:38:26,390 --> 00:38:30,230
Kind of a Euclidean approach that I'm
going to say is not quite how it works.

649
00:38:30,590 --> 00:38:33,050
Everything is random at the start.

650
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:37,480
And somehow life figures out how narrow
in on possibilities it's processes of

651
00:38:37,481 --> 00:38:42,010
elimination. Okay. So just these two
takeaways to push the tech envelope,

652
00:38:42,011 --> 00:38:46,390
pay attention to how tech simulates
but doesn't yet emulate striving cells.

653
00:38:46,690 --> 00:38:48,670
And Th that's the thing we can talk about.

654
00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:52,930
And the other is to attempt to emulate,
pay attention to emergent constraints.

655
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:57,300
Nasca chromatic airway, but dynamic
narrowing of possibilities. Thank you.

656
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:03,073
Okay.

657
00:39:04,650 --> 00:39:06,600
Anybody have any questions and challenges?

658
00:39:07,170 --> 00:39:11,100
So one of the interesting consequences
of the way that you've presented this is

659
00:39:11,101 --> 00:39:12,310
that,
is it you,

660
00:39:12,311 --> 00:39:15,030
you mentioned it works on multiple
levels at the immune system level or the

661
00:39:15,031 --> 00:39:18,930
organization.
Is there any bias in this for,

662
00:39:18,990 --> 00:39:23,430
I'm observing this at any particular
level because you could look at it from an

663
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:28,410
aunt, sell you an aunt, um,
organism as we understand it,

664
00:39:28,590 --> 00:39:32,370
to an ant colony to the super
colony that covers California. Yes.

665
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,260
Versus humanities,

666
00:39:34,290 --> 00:39:39,270
a cell or a person standing
here or their neighborhood.

667
00:39:39,271 --> 00:39:41,000
Community of society.
Yes.

668
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:44,510
Wonderful. Um, great question. Uh,

669
00:39:44,630 --> 00:39:48,500
the people who are doing this research
come at it from a variety of different

670
00:39:48,501 --> 00:39:48,801
angles.

671
00:39:48,801 --> 00:39:52,010
My background's in the social sciences
and most of what I write is in the social

672
00:39:52,011 --> 00:39:55,850
sciences and yet it's all under the
influence of this model. By now, I mean,

673
00:39:55,851 --> 00:39:59,270
the thousand articles I've
written, they're all based
on this, the political work,

674
00:39:59,271 --> 00:40:02,660
the moral work I do, it's a psycho
proctologist it's all based on this.

675
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:04,880
In our own research though,

676
00:40:05,390 --> 00:40:09,560
we keep focusing on patients is zero.

677
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:14,360
We are kind of obsessed at that level
and we also have people who come into the

678
00:40:14,361 --> 00:40:18,350
group with some intuition,
some gut,

679
00:40:18,670 --> 00:40:22,730
a assumption that they want to
uphold their kind of tethered to it.

680
00:40:22,731 --> 00:40:26,630
And they come to this work,
like it's a Rorschach blot.
And they start to say, wow,

681
00:40:26,631 --> 00:40:29,170
this proves that I was
right about this thing. Um,

682
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:34,190
I am delighted with how we manage to
keep that from influencing the work.

683
00:40:34,191 --> 00:40:38,120
And a lot of this is because,
uh, Terry is a nerd. He's,

684
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:41,840
he's dogging about this question.
He wants to get it right.

685
00:40:42,050 --> 00:40:43,640
I've seen him change his mind lots.

686
00:40:43,641 --> 00:40:47,960
I've changed his minds about things and
he's way more advanced academically than

687
00:40:47,961 --> 00:40:51,470
me. He's not interested in the status
questions. He's, he's not interested in,

688
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:54,890
I don't see in him any
ax to grind. Um, yes,

689
00:40:54,891 --> 00:40:59,300
he would like life to
continue striving. Um, but no,

690
00:40:59,301 --> 00:41:00,560
I haven't seen that influence with it.

691
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:03,770
We've got some biologists in the
group that are primarily interested in

692
00:41:03,771 --> 00:41:04,940
multicellularity.

693
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:08,690
We've got all sorts of people who are
interested in the implications of this

694
00:41:08,691 --> 00:41:13,660
narrowing, not airwing approach, um,
to all levels of living systems. Uh,

695
00:41:13,690 --> 00:41:18,080
we've got a few guys who are really
interested in whether organizations are

696
00:41:18,081 --> 00:41:22,100
organisms and um, yeah,
they can look like it,

697
00:41:22,130 --> 00:41:25,550
but are they really? So we, we
have foster about that a lot. I,

698
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:27,590
I at one point was writing
as though they were,

699
00:41:27,591 --> 00:41:32,591
that there were these super organisms
and Terry laid out the challenges to that

700
00:41:33,170 --> 00:41:35,620
because it gives that impression
that it probably isn't a,

701
00:41:35,630 --> 00:41:38,930
let's look at what is the criteria by
which you could say that something is

702
00:41:38,931 --> 00:41:43,931
actually a striving self as compared to
an agglomeration of striving selves that

703
00:41:44,181 --> 00:41:44,991
are achieving things.

704
00:41:44,991 --> 00:41:49,250
So I love the way we employ the power
of neutral thinking to the best of our

705
00:41:49,251 --> 00:41:50,690
abilities.
And by the way,

706
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:54,110
you cannot work in science without the
possibly that you will have spent your

707
00:41:54,111 --> 00:41:58,250
entire life barking up the wrong tree.
So I have no idea whether this is right,

708
00:41:58,251 --> 00:42:03,251
but I am enthusiastic about the way that
it addresses a question freshly framed.

709
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:07,530
Um, I feel a little bit like, like, uh,

710
00:42:08,930 --> 00:42:10,830
like you've reduced,
uh,

711
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:16,960
kind of the original question to something
which is a lot more tractable and

712
00:42:18,110 --> 00:42:22,310
cause less satisfying question.
But um,

713
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:26,120
for a bigger question,
where does consciousness fit into this?

714
00:42:27,990 --> 00:42:31,570
Well, Terry is a neuroscientist. He's
got theories about their, their hunches,

715
00:42:32,230 --> 00:42:34,600
about how you, you'd actually
get to quality and consciousness.

716
00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:39,310
I just got back from the a annual
Tucson conference on the science of

717
00:42:39,311 --> 00:42:42,250
consciousness.
And it's remarkable how much they are.

718
00:42:42,251 --> 00:42:46,570
They are talking as though
everything is conscious.

719
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:49,840
And then there's some
kind of a quantum leap.

720
00:42:49,841 --> 00:42:52,810
It crosses a threshold and then
becomes conscious in ways we recognize.

721
00:42:52,811 --> 00:42:55,090
And you got people who are saying that
there's no consciousness and there's

722
00:42:55,091 --> 00:42:57,370
people who are talking about it
coming out at the quantum level.

723
00:42:57,580 --> 00:43:02,480
All this stuff very satisfying. I
don't think realistic at all. Um,

724
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:05,890
so it's one of the questions
that we deal with, you know,

725
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:10,980
Terry having spent the first 20 years
working on how language affects junk

726
00:43:10,990 --> 00:43:11,770
consciousness.

727
00:43:11,770 --> 00:43:16,660
I have hunches about consciousness
being the really big difference and I'm

728
00:43:16,661 --> 00:43:21,661
especially interested in how it changes
adaptation that his life has been

729
00:43:21,701 --> 00:43:25,360
adapting for 3.8 billion years and now
we're doing it under the distorting

730
00:43:25,361 --> 00:43:27,550
influence of language,

731
00:43:27,580 --> 00:43:32,560
which makes us like these chronically
hallucinating mammals with all sorts of

732
00:43:32,561 --> 00:43:35,900
interesting consequences, positive and
negative, and how to manage them become a,

733
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:39,970
it's a focus of another
whole book of mine. But, um,

734
00:43:40,090 --> 00:43:43,750
satisfying is a really
key word here. Um, yes,

735
00:43:43,780 --> 00:43:47,920
in many ways this has to be simpler.
There's, you don't get any engineering,

736
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:52,600
you don't have life already existing
and you don't get the delight of the

737
00:43:52,601 --> 00:43:57,250
impression that you have discovered
how life as you experience it works.

738
00:43:57,570 --> 00:44:01,630
Um, it's, it's going to have to be
a simple solution at this level.

739
00:44:01,780 --> 00:44:04,960
And yet I would argue that
whether you buy this solution,

740
00:44:04,961 --> 00:44:08,530
this proposed answer to it or not,
that's the level to work on it.

741
00:44:08,531 --> 00:44:11,350
Because if you cannot
explain striving selves,

742
00:44:11,590 --> 00:44:16,590
you are not going to be able to get beyond
explaining hair with wigs or quills.

743
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:21,580
You're your way up at the high levels
and assuming or assuming a way,

744
00:44:21,581 --> 00:44:23,500
all sorts of stuff that the lower levels,

745
00:44:23,860 --> 00:44:28,100
is there a point at which awareness
or awareness of awareness becomes

746
00:44:28,101 --> 00:44:32,590
significant or important to you? That's
another area where we explore. Um,

747
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:37,590
uh, we think that basically what
we're describing here is what,

748
00:44:37,650 --> 00:44:40,140
what Terry calls vegetative sentience.

749
00:44:40,620 --> 00:44:43,600
I don't like the word sentience
cause it implies feeling. Um,

750
00:44:43,620 --> 00:44:44,850
I like responsiveness.

751
00:44:44,851 --> 00:44:48,870
He and I've been working on how to
find words that don't carry a bunch of

752
00:44:48,871 --> 00:44:52,680
baggage and yet nailed it.
Um, uh, so responsiveness,

753
00:44:52,710 --> 00:44:54,960
there's responsiveness
from the Gecko with these,

754
00:44:54,961 --> 00:44:59,880
if they break open their respond by
doing work to regenerate themselves,

755
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:02,100
uh, to repair themselves. Um,

756
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:06,600
then there's feeling which is more
like sentience and then there's

757
00:45:06,601 --> 00:45:11,010
conceptualizing these are the three that
are of greatest interest to us. And yes,

758
00:45:11,011 --> 00:45:14,400
there are a bunch of wonderful articles
by Terry and colleagues about how it

759
00:45:14,401 --> 00:45:18,060
works at the higher levels. But
again, for this presentation,

760
00:45:18,061 --> 00:45:20,760
I've really wanted to concentrate
on patient serio zero,

761
00:45:20,761 --> 00:45:24,330
because if we can't explain them,
uh, we're groping in the dark.

762
00:45:26,050 --> 00:45:26,960
I take it to more of it.

763
00:45:26,970 --> 00:45:31,180
That word is death on to that cycle of
each generating and like the statue.

764
00:45:31,650 --> 00:45:36,090
Wonderful question. I,
um, I am Chrono phobic.

765
00:45:36,091 --> 00:45:40,540
I am Chrono fillic. Um, deaf fascinates
me. I memorize poems about it.

766
00:45:40,550 --> 00:45:42,850
Where does it fit into this model?
Um,

767
00:45:44,130 --> 00:45:49,130
what is dying when one of these breaks
apart or opens in the presence of

768
00:45:49,951 --> 00:45:53,820
reactants?
What's dying is not the material form.

769
00:45:53,850 --> 00:45:58,100
The material form can actually change
over openings and closings. That is, uh,

770
00:45:58,140 --> 00:46:00,730
several generations down
the line. One of these, uh,

771
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:06,030
seeds may have no molecules in
continuity with the original one.

772
00:46:06,390 --> 00:46:10,310
Um, and it's not the energy, the
energy is coming from the outside. Um,

773
00:46:10,620 --> 00:46:15,060
what is being lost is the constraint.
When I die,

774
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:18,960
my molecules are free
to do way more things.

775
00:46:19,590 --> 00:46:23,220
Life is not an add on to physics
and chemistry. It's a subset.

776
00:46:23,221 --> 00:46:28,221
It's a self constrained subset that is
me reducing the possibilities as long as

777
00:46:28,321 --> 00:46:31,260
I live. And as those, uh, the,

778
00:46:31,350 --> 00:46:36,350
the synergies by now through evolution
accumulated vast quantities of synergies

779
00:46:36,481 --> 00:46:37,530
like the one we started with,

780
00:46:37,531 --> 00:46:40,590
the complimentarity where they both
prevent each other from ending.

781
00:46:40,740 --> 00:46:45,520
We do that all the time in our bodies
at so many different levels. It's a,

782
00:46:45,550 --> 00:46:48,440
it's a marvel, it's many Phd's. Um,

783
00:46:48,570 --> 00:46:53,570
but what you lose is the constraint
and suddenly the molecules are free.

784
00:46:54,250 --> 00:46:55,083
Um,

785
00:46:55,710 --> 00:47:00,240
I read recently then Brown's
new book on origins of life.

786
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:05,290
Um, uh, and he tries to make
that a pretty picture. Um,

787
00:47:05,430 --> 00:47:06,880
like as if,
uh,

788
00:47:06,930 --> 00:47:10,020
everything is moving towards entropy
and that means that they're free.

789
00:47:10,140 --> 00:47:12,330
And that means that they're shining
their light everywhere in the world.

790
00:47:12,331 --> 00:47:16,050
That is not how entropy works. Um,
entropy. It's things falling apart.

791
00:47:16,050 --> 00:47:18,300
And if life was about maximizing entropy,

792
00:47:18,301 --> 00:47:22,680
which is also a popular notion
in his book, Jeremy England
brings this up, um, uh,

793
00:47:22,770 --> 00:47:26,160
then let's just explode the
soccer. I mean there's, uh, if you,

794
00:47:26,161 --> 00:47:30,490
if you want maximum entropy, there are
faster ways to do it, then we do it. Um,

795
00:47:30,690 --> 00:47:33,250
we living beings,
we actually sequester energy.

796
00:47:33,251 --> 00:47:35,620
That's one of the reasons
why we've got petrochemicals.

797
00:47:36,070 --> 00:47:39,700
So the thing to pay attention to here
was trying to get to in the last two

798
00:47:39,701 --> 00:47:43,240
slides is that what I am is
a constraint on what happens.

799
00:47:43,990 --> 00:47:47,500
And when that constraints starts to fail,
I lose my agency.

800
00:47:48,010 --> 00:47:51,970
And at that point I'm dead.
And the molecules are free
to be in a whole lot more,

801
00:47:52,410 --> 00:47:54,790
uh, uh, uh, configurations

802
00:47:56,350 --> 00:47:59,050
and often with offspring.
In fact,

803
00:47:59,290 --> 00:48:02,770
my fellow grandfather of by
grandchild is right here.

804
00:48:03,220 --> 00:48:07,780
Talk About Oscar is my first
time at heck a tech Mecca.

805
00:48:08,140 --> 00:48:10,210
I am delighted to be here.

806
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:14,920
I'm grateful that you were able to give
me your attention for this time and do

807
00:48:14,921 --> 00:48:17,650
feel free to get in touch
about any of this if,

808
00:48:17,710 --> 00:48:22,210
if questions and challenges and kickings
of the tire come to you tonight or

809
00:48:22,270 --> 00:48:26,650
anytime I'm around. Okay. Very local
in Berkeley and thank you very much.

810
00:48:27,630 --> 00:48:32,050
[inaudible].
