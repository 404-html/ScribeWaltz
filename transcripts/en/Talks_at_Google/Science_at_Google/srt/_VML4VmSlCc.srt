1
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:13,070
Hi everybody. Thanks. I'm
pretty sure you can hear me.

2
00:00:13,071 --> 00:00:15,160
The sound guys are working
on it, so that's great. Um,

3
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:17,300
thanks for having me here today.

4
00:00:17,301 --> 00:00:22,180
I want to start by just
asking what seems to be a, uh,

5
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:27,230
a simple question and that
is what underlies success.

6
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:32,210
What allows us to succeed academically
and professionally to have financial

7
00:00:32,211 --> 00:00:36,980
security, to eat right exercise and be
healthy, to have good relationships.

8
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:42,080
What's the key? Well, it's not very
often that you can find a magic bullet,

9
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:47,110
but in this case you can self control
the ability to delay gratification,

10
00:00:47,241 --> 00:00:50,870
to value the future.
More than the present is what matters.

11
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,030
And there's lots of research
that attest to this,

12
00:00:53,031 --> 00:00:56,780
but in one way or another it kind of
all derives from what is arguably one of

13
00:00:56,781 --> 00:01:00,710
the most famous experiments in 20th
century psychology. And that is Walter.

14
00:01:00,711 --> 00:01:03,680
Michelle is the marshmallow test and
most of you probably know what this is,

15
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:05,750
but in case you don't,
let me tell you quickly.

16
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:09,650
So Michelle would take four year olds
and he would put a marshmallow down in

17
00:01:09,651 --> 00:01:11,030
front of me and say,
you can eat this now.

18
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:15,350
But if you wait until I come back 15
minutes from now, you can have two.

19
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:19,820
And now this is a child friendly
version of a dilemma that we all face,

20
00:01:19,821 --> 00:01:22,460
something that economists
call intertemporal choice,

21
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:26,240
which is basically decisions that have
different consequences as time unfolds.

22
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:31,040
And I like to kind of explain this with
a reference to Aesop's fable of the ant

23
00:01:31,041 --> 00:01:34,670
and the grasshopper. Um, if you remember
the story, it was a beautiful summer.

24
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:38,600
The grasshopper spent its time dancing
and frolicking while the ant went to the

25
00:01:38,601 --> 00:01:43,460
fields and toiled to put away food
for the winter. When the winter came,

26
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:47,930
the aunt had a lot of food. The
grasshopper was out of luck and starved.

27
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:51,710
And so what you're seeing is
we're, we're contrasting here, um,

28
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:56,240
desire for pleasure in the moment
versus a willingness to sacrifice in the

29
00:01:56,241 --> 00:02:00,370
moment for larger pleasures
and gains downline.

30
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:05,510
Now the problem for us humans is we tend
to discount the value of the future.

31
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:08,630
In some ways,
this makes good sense of burden.

32
00:02:08,631 --> 00:02:11,510
The hand can certainly be worth
more than two in the Bush sometimes,

33
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:16,880
but we tend to do it. I'm a bit
excessively, right? We do it so much,

34
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:21,110
especially as our world has become a
more certain place that we tend to make

35
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,500
very seemingly irrational decisions.

36
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:29,510
Now what Michelle found is that the
kids who had self can show we're able to

37
00:02:29,511 --> 00:02:33,740
stop and not gobble the marshmallow
bit weight over time had much better

38
00:02:33,741 --> 00:02:37,760
outcomes, better grades, higher sats,
better relationships. Since that time,

39
00:02:37,761 --> 00:02:41,900
lots of people have tied the ability to
delay gratification and to persevere in

40
00:02:41,901 --> 00:02:45,260
the face of challenges,
to having better savings for retirement,

41
00:02:45,261 --> 00:02:48,590
less credit card debt, lower
obesity, less addictive behaviors,

42
00:02:48,591 --> 00:02:51,230
less impulsivity and
shopping and consumerism.

43
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:54,380
And so that raises an important
question for us, right?

44
00:02:54,381 --> 00:02:58,400
If self control is so important,
how are we supposed to obtain it?

45
00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:02,230
How we get more of it now here?
Um,

46
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:06,760
Michelle's view is still kind of the
one that's held commonly both by,

47
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:09,400
by the lay public and scientists alike.

48
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:13,450
And it's that emotions are the
being of self control, right?

49
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:18,430
These emotions have to be overruled
by kind of cool cognitive,

50
00:03:18,431 --> 00:03:22,600
well planned, um, thoughts and
willpower for going to succeed.

51
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:27,670
And if you go to your local
Barnes and noble or Amazon,

52
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:32,230
you will find the shelves filled with
bestsellers that extol just this idea.

53
00:03:32,231 --> 00:03:34,060
So all of these books
in one way or another,

54
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:39,690
urge people to use willpower or other
cognitive strategies involving executive

55
00:03:39,971 --> 00:03:40,421
function,

56
00:03:40,421 --> 00:03:44,860
which is that part of your mind that
allows you to kind of plan a and reason

57
00:03:44,861 --> 00:03:45,810
yourself,
uh,

58
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:50,080
and to developing certain habits and
ways of dealing with temptations.

59
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:53,260
But you know,
an idea has really entered the Zeitgeists,

60
00:03:53,261 --> 00:03:57,940
not when you see it in Barnes and noble,
but when you see it on sesame street.

61
00:03:58,450 --> 00:03:59,800
And so in 2013,

62
00:03:59,801 --> 00:04:04,030
the folks there who are very dedicated
to child education realize that teaching

63
00:04:04,031 --> 00:04:09,031
kids self control and grit was an
important part of them being successful.

64
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,680
And so they thought,
who better to teach this?

65
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:16,450
Then the walking talking it himself,
cookie monster. Right? And so in 2013,

66
00:04:16,451 --> 00:04:21,220
cookie's still said, me want cookie, but
they added something and now he said,

67
00:04:21,710 --> 00:04:22,730
but me,
wait.

68
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:28,590
And so for that whole season we saw
cookie teach kids how to use willpower to

69
00:04:29,021 --> 00:04:33,220
avoid their temptations and he
would distract himself. Yeah.

70
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:35,950
By creating strategies like
pretending the thing he wanted.

71
00:04:35,951 --> 00:04:40,000
My favorite was the cookie was stinky
fish or he would develop all kinds of

72
00:04:40,001 --> 00:04:44,860
strategies cause he knew his willpower
would probably fail. But unlike cookie,

73
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:47,380
what happens, for most
of us, he was successful.

74
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:51,790
What happens for most of us is we're
not as often as we'd like and what the

75
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:55,600
scientific research shows
is that willpower can work,

76
00:04:56,200 --> 00:05:00,700
but it tends to be rather fragile.
Um,

77
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:05,740
Kathleen vose who's at the University
of Minnesota and kind of one of the

78
00:05:05,741 --> 00:05:10,510
world's leading experts on self
control, um, followed people,

79
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:15,430
um, four weeks in their daily lives,
um, with like, you know, beepers and,

80
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:18,650
but I sound old beepers, smartphones, um,

81
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:22,420
where they could actually
see what, what, what, um,

82
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:24,970
temptations people were facing
and how they dealt with it.

83
00:05:24,971 --> 00:05:29,440
And what she found is that one out of
more than one out of every six times

84
00:05:29,441 --> 00:05:32,710
people tried to resist the temptation
and stick to their goals. You know,

85
00:05:32,711 --> 00:05:36,970
to go to the gym or not overeat or not
overspend or work hard rather than watch

86
00:05:36,971 --> 00:05:38,830
TV and they failed.

87
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:43,780
And for goals that are even more
important to us, the stats are even worse.

88
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:49,140
So 8% of New Year's resolutions or capital
years end 25% fail right now in the

89
00:05:51,731 --> 00:05:54,160
second week of January.
Okay.

90
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:58,820
And so you're not alone if you're
one of these. And so you know,

91
00:05:58,821 --> 00:06:03,821
my question as a scientist is if we'd
been using science for the past 20 years

92
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:08,000
to try and help people develop
self control, develop grit,

93
00:06:08,001 --> 00:06:12,320
which is the ability to kind of persevere
in the face of challenges to achieve

94
00:06:12,321 --> 00:06:16,760
your long term goals, then why are we
still so bad? Why is Angela Duckworth,

95
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:20,420
he's one of the um, discovers and
major proponents of grid is set. Is it?

96
00:06:20,421 --> 00:06:25,190
Why is it that no one really knows how
to cultivate self control and grit in a

97
00:06:25,191 --> 00:06:26,480
way that endures?

98
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:32,320
And I think it's because when we faced
a fork in the road beside between

99
00:06:32,361 --> 00:06:36,350
deciding to use strategies based on
reason and willpower and one's based on

100
00:06:36,351 --> 00:06:40,430
emotion, we chose the wrong
one. And because we did that,

101
00:06:40,431 --> 00:06:45,431
we've kind of set ourselves up for a
lot of failure and a lot of frustration.

102
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:48,310
Let me tell you why.

103
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:52,550
Think that one thing we know about
willpower is it tends to be difficult to

104
00:06:52,551 --> 00:06:55,640
maintain,
not because it's some finite resource,

105
00:06:55,641 --> 00:06:59,930
but because every time you're trying to
resist the temptation to do something

106
00:06:59,931 --> 00:07:03,920
fun, your brain interprets that as effort
cause it's discounting the value of the

107
00:07:03,921 --> 00:07:08,120
future goal and over time as it keeps
becoming harder and harder to do something

108
00:07:08,121 --> 00:07:11,150
and harder to maintain your focus,
it feels more effortful.

109
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:14,750
And so what we know is that when
you're trying to resist temptations

110
00:07:14,751 --> 00:07:17,990
continuously,
over time you're going to fail.

111
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,850
And the more often you try it,

112
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:24,010
the more likely you will fail
without some type of, of,

113
00:07:24,011 --> 00:07:28,610
of respite in between. Um, you may say,

114
00:07:28,611 --> 00:07:32,390
well but I know people who have
good self control and willpower

115
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:37,730
here with the research shows is there are
self control isn't any better than the

116
00:07:37,731 --> 00:07:41,120
rest of us. The people who we think have
really good self control and willpower,

117
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:45,320
the reason they succeed is because they
structure their lives so as not to come

118
00:07:45,321 --> 00:07:47,540
in contact with temptation
in the first place.

119
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:51,140
It's actually as if they know
that willpower is going to fail.

120
00:07:51,141 --> 00:07:55,430
And so they're smart enough to structure
their life so that they can avoid that

121
00:07:55,431 --> 00:07:59,300
temptation appear like they're
in good control of their desires,

122
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:02,060
but perhaps potentially
worse than willpower.

123
00:08:02,061 --> 00:08:05,420
Being weak is that reason itself.

124
00:08:05,421 --> 00:08:09,560
And how we set our goals and decide what
we're going to do is an objective but

125
00:08:09,561 --> 00:08:11,000
can actually be really biased.

126
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:13,730
So let me give you an example
of what I mean by this.

127
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:16,220
One thing we study in my lab is cheating.

128
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:20,960
And so a typical experiment we do is we'll
bring people in and we say, okay, look,

129
00:08:20,961 --> 00:08:23,280
there are two tasks that need to be done.
Uh,

130
00:08:23,281 --> 00:08:27,350
a short and fun one involving
photo hunt takes about 10 minutes,

131
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:29,900
a really long, onerous someone. Um,

132
00:08:29,901 --> 00:08:32,990
it takes about 45 minutes doing logic
problems and things that most of our

133
00:08:32,991 --> 00:08:37,850
students don't like to do. Here's a
virtual coin flipper. Why is it virtual?

134
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:41,390
So I can control what comes
up on it. Um, if it's heads,

135
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:44,420
you're going to do the short
fund photo hunt. If it's towels,

136
00:08:44,421 --> 00:08:47,540
you're going to do this long
owner's problem and that
guy was sitting out in the

137
00:08:47,541 --> 00:08:52,250
hall next to you, he's going to get
stuck doing whatever one you don't do.

138
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:58,110
And then we leave them alone and they're
on hidden video, which they don't know.

139
00:08:58,111 --> 00:09:00,480
Of course. Um, what do you think they do?

140
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:03,423
They cheat.

141
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:08,370
What percentage of
people cheat? Um, close.

142
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:12,990
90%. 90% of people cheat
and bite. She, I mean,

143
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:17,700
they either don't use the virtual flipper,
just say, you know, go to and say,

144
00:09:17,701 --> 00:09:20,010
I got, yeah, I flipped it
and I got the easy task.

145
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:22,970
Or they flip it once it comes up with
the answer they don't want and they pick

146
00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:25,110
yet to try and see what
they're going to get.

147
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,510
Now the interesting thing
here is if you ask people,

148
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:32,310
if you're in this situation and
you didn't flip, is that wrong?

149
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:34,380
The only time in my life
I get unanimous data,

150
00:09:34,381 --> 00:09:39,060
100% of people say to not flip the coin,
to cheat on this task would be wrong.

151
00:09:39,061 --> 00:09:43,050
Yet 90% of them do. Now I'm not
running this outside of the prison.

152
00:09:43,051 --> 00:09:43,711
So the question is,

153
00:09:43,711 --> 00:09:48,711
why is it the case that most people just
like you and me kind of given to our

154
00:09:48,751 --> 00:09:50,790
temptations here?
Well,

155
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:54,870
at the end of the experiment we asked
them how fairly did you act these 90% you

156
00:09:54,871 --> 00:09:59,871
cheated and this is a scale of one to
seven to the higher numbers basically mean

157
00:09:59,941 --> 00:10:03,790
you, you reacted more fairly.
And people say, Oh, you know,

158
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:06,210
they're above the mid
point. I'm like, I did okay.

159
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:08,700
If you then run the experiment again,

160
00:10:08,701 --> 00:10:12,120
except this time people are
watching someone else cheat, right?

161
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:16,800
Suddenly it's not as fair.
Right? So if you do it, it's bad.

162
00:10:16,801 --> 00:10:21,720
If I do this exact same thing, it's more
fair. Okay. And then this is hypocrisy.

163
00:10:21,721 --> 00:10:24,480
Plain and simple. Now when I
talk about some people say, oh,

164
00:10:24,481 --> 00:10:27,450
well you know what happened? It's like
there are emotions got the best of them.

165
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:28,290
Um,

166
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:31,440
their willpower wasn't strong enough to
override their desire to not want to do

167
00:10:31,441 --> 00:10:33,990
this awful task.
That's not what it was.

168
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:36,450
The reason we know is when we
ran the experiment of third time,

169
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:39,360
we put people under what's
called a cognitive load,

170
00:10:39,361 --> 00:10:43,610
which is a way to kind of occupy their
ability to kind of engage in reason and

171
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:45,210
rationalization.
Basically,

172
00:10:45,211 --> 00:10:48,720
we're distracting them with a secondary
task while they're deciding what they're

173
00:10:48,721 --> 00:10:53,460
doing here. When you asked them how fairly
did you act? Hypocrisy goes away. Okay.

174
00:10:53,461 --> 00:10:56,160
They realize that what they did,

175
00:10:56,161 --> 00:11:00,370
they're cheating was bad and
just as bad as anybody else's.

176
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:03,090
They don't give themselves leniency.

177
00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:06,660
And so what was leading to this
was rationalization, right?

178
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:09,120
Everybody has this
immediate Pang of guilt.

179
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:14,450
But if we give you a minute to think
about what you did or what you want to do,

180
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:20,390
your construct a story for why it
was okay for you to do this right?

181
00:11:20,521 --> 00:11:23,580
And people will say, Oh, well normally
I wouldn't have done this, but you know,

182
00:11:23,581 --> 00:11:27,020
I had a, I had an appointment,
I couldn't be late for a,

183
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:28,950
or my favorite was the guy who said,

184
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:31,290
well I wouldn't have
done it except you know,

185
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:33,780
the guy was sitting out in the
hall is going to get the next tech.

186
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:37,770
He looked like he was an engineering
major and I thought he would really like

187
00:11:37,771 --> 00:11:39,960
the harder problems.
Right.

188
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:42,810
And so you see what people
are doing is they're there,

189
00:11:42,811 --> 00:11:47,340
they're rationalizing themselves into
doing something that goes against their

190
00:11:47,341 --> 00:11:49,260
own moral code.
What's the problem here?

191
00:11:49,261 --> 00:11:54,261
It means that many times when
we're trying to resist a goal to,

192
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:54,791
you know,

193
00:11:54,791 --> 00:11:58,520
watch TV instead of go to the gym to
not work hard to throw in the talent.

194
00:11:58,521 --> 00:12:01,570
Something we can talk ourselves into.
Why that's good.

195
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:05,590
We'll often reason ourselves into
why it's okay for us to do this.

196
00:12:05,591 --> 00:12:09,610
Why it's okay for me to buy the new iPhone
instead of put money into retirement

197
00:12:09,611 --> 00:12:13,870
because I deserve it.
And if we can reason ourselves into this,

198
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:18,220
then we're never going to use
willpower in the first place. Finally,

199
00:12:18,221 --> 00:12:20,100
the last reason I think reasonable power,

200
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:24,070
the wrong way to go about trying to foster
our goals and our longterm success is

201
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:26,290
there actually can be detrimental.

202
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:30,400
So when those of you who
have like struggled with
trying to achieve a goal and

203
00:12:30,401 --> 00:12:34,360
trying to use willpower to get it, you
can feel this tension that you often have.

204
00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:36,730
So this is work done by Greg Miller,

205
00:12:36,731 --> 00:12:39,190
who's a psychologist at
Northwestern university.

206
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:42,670
And what he found is he
looked at kids who were from,

207
00:12:42,671 --> 00:12:46,750
from disadvantaged backgrounds
and who had self control.

208
00:12:46,751 --> 00:12:50,650
And we're trying to resist temptations,
right? To have to have grit and succeed.

209
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:52,450
And what he found is that,
yeah,

210
00:12:52,451 --> 00:12:55,570
those who had higher self control
based on willpower and trying to force

211
00:12:55,571 --> 00:13:00,100
themselves to do these things did succeed
more, but it came at a cost. Right?

212
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:05,140
These kids also showed premature aging
of their immune cells because of the

213
00:13:05,141 --> 00:13:07,360
stress involved.
And so yeah,

214
00:13:07,361 --> 00:13:10,450
they're succeeding but they're not
going to be around as long to enjoy it.

215
00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:15,340
And it's because we're trying to always
fight a desire is putting your body

216
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:17,350
under an intense amount of stress.

217
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:21,910
And so what I want to convince you of
today is that emotions aren't the problem.

218
00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:25,030
Emotions don't always lead to
inpatients. Sure. There are some,

219
00:13:25,031 --> 00:13:28,240
there are things like anger that one
that will lead you to strike out.

220
00:13:28,241 --> 00:13:30,040
There are things like, um, um,

221
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:33,850
lust and desire that may may make
you act for immediate gratification,

222
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:37,420
but there are other emotions
that do different things. Okay.

223
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:42,100
Things like gratitude, compassion,
and an authentic feeling of pride.

224
00:13:42,101 --> 00:13:45,730
Not Arrogance or Hubris. I mean,
if you think about it, why these,

225
00:13:45,731 --> 00:13:49,180
these are the emotions that
underlie social living.

226
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:53,290
These are the emotions that
make us willing to invest
in other people that cost

227
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:56,740
to themselves to do ourselves.
When I feel grateful,

228
00:13:57,250 --> 00:14:01,240
I'm willing to pay somebody back
and spend a lot of time to do that.

229
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:06,040
If I feel compassion for somebody, I
am willing to give them time, money,

230
00:14:06,041 --> 00:14:10,450
a shoulder to cry on something that that
is maybe difficult for me in the moment,

231
00:14:10,451 --> 00:14:13,240
but we'll help them.
If I feel proud of my abilities,

232
00:14:13,241 --> 00:14:15,040
I'm willing to work hard to develop them,

233
00:14:15,041 --> 00:14:18,490
to help my team and myself
succeed as part of it.

234
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,470
Sorry. Um, and so if I'm right,

235
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:27,430
then what it means is that if
you're feeling these emotions,

236
00:14:27,431 --> 00:14:30,340
it should make it easier for you
to succeed in the marshmallow test.

237
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,080
But I don't work with kids.

238
00:14:32,081 --> 00:14:35,350
I work with adults and most
adults don't like marshmallows,

239
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:37,780
but they do like cold,
hard cash.

240
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:42,640
And so we ran the experiment that's an
adult version of the marshmallow tests in

241
00:14:42,641 --> 00:14:45,600
this way. We brought people
in and we gave them a whit.

242
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:48,490
First we asked them to describe
a time they felt very grateful,

243
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:50,980
they felt very happy or they're just,
you know,

244
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:53,330
something about their daily
life that was kind of neutral.

245
00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:57,380
We that had them complete a bunch
of questions that were of the form,

246
00:14:57,381 --> 00:15:01,520
you can have x dollars now or y dollars
and z days were why was always greater

247
00:15:01,521 --> 00:15:05,360
than x and z varied over weeks to months.

248
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,360
So it's kind of like what you want one
marshmallow now or two marshmallows in

249
00:15:08,361 --> 00:15:09,190
three days.

250
00:15:09,190 --> 00:15:14,190
Except the typical question was would
you rather have $35 now or $75 in three

251
00:15:14,421 --> 00:15:16,520
weeks?
And to make it interesting for people,

252
00:15:16,521 --> 00:15:19,400
we told them we'd pick one of their
many responses and we'd honor it.

253
00:15:19,401 --> 00:15:21,020
So if you said you wanted a $35,

254
00:15:21,021 --> 00:15:25,730
now we'd hand you $35 if you said
like 65 or 75 and three weeks,

255
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:27,320
we'd mail you the check.

256
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:32,690
Now from this we could count and determine
how much people devalue or discount

257
00:15:32,691 --> 00:15:37,010
the value of the future. And what
you're seeing here is a things graft as,

258
00:15:37,011 --> 00:15:41,960
as annual discount factors in one
way to understand what that means is,

259
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:42,360
uh,

260
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:47,360
an annual discount factor of 0.15 means
people think that $100 in a year is

261
00:15:47,721 --> 00:15:51,830
worth $15 today. Or another way of
saying that is if I gave you $15 today,

262
00:15:51,831 --> 00:15:55,640
you forego getting $100 in a year,
which I dunno about you,

263
00:15:55,641 --> 00:15:57,710
but unless you need that $15 to survive,
you know,

264
00:15:57,711 --> 00:16:00,440
the ability to kind of Quinn couple of
your money in a year's time given with

265
00:16:00,441 --> 00:16:05,030
the banks are paying, it's
pretty good. Um, but people
were pretty impatient, right?

266
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:09,950
People who are feeling nothing
in particular, uh, had a
discount factor of 0.17,

267
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:11,480
right? They'd say, I see seven,

268
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:15,660
I see $100 in years where $17 now
give me $17 now you can forget them.

269
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:17,750
Forget about that.
$100 a year.

270
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:20,630
What about people who were
feeling grateful right here?

271
00:16:20,631 --> 00:16:22,910
We doubled their level of self control.

272
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:27,800
These people discounted the value
of the future less for them.

273
00:16:27,801 --> 00:16:30,350
$100 a year from now was were $30,

274
00:16:30,351 --> 00:16:32,330
which meant if I gave them
the same deal as most people,

275
00:16:32,331 --> 00:16:34,190
would you take $17 to forego it?

276
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:39,260
They wouldn't take it now just to show
you that it's not just about feeling good,

277
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:43,610
happy people. We're no
different than people who were
feeling, uh, neutral, right?

278
00:16:43,611 --> 00:16:47,390
There's something intrinsically
motivating about valuing the future,

279
00:16:47,391 --> 00:16:51,080
willing to sacrifice about these
social emotions that bind us together,

280
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:55,880
like gratitude. And we followed,
we ran the experiment again,

281
00:16:55,881 --> 00:16:59,150
but we followed people for three
weeks in their daily life, um,

282
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:02,120
and measuring every day how
much gratitude they felt.

283
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:05,690
And what we found is you can see here
the people who felt the mean level of

284
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:08,660
gratitude and one standard
deviation above and below.

285
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:13,010
And what you see is a nice
linear function. The more
gratitude you feel in life,

286
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:15,320
the more patient you are.
At the end of those three weeks,

287
00:17:15,321 --> 00:17:17,720
we gave them a similar
financial task to do.

288
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:22,430
So experiencing these emotions are kind
of like booster shots of self control.

289
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:25,220
They make you more patient,
they make you value the future more.

290
00:17:25,221 --> 00:17:28,820
They make you willing to wait for the
bigger cash, the bigger marshmallow,

291
00:17:28,821 --> 00:17:30,220
to not eat the Broccoli so that,

292
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:33,140
I mean to eat the Broccoli so that you
can be healthy instead of the French

293
00:17:33,141 --> 00:17:37,310
fries when you see your doctor
next. Um, how about pride?

294
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:41,930
Well, if I'm right, then pride should
also increase the value of the future.

295
00:17:41,931 --> 00:17:43,400
But we want it to look at this in term of,
uh,

296
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:47,360
in terms of a measure that people
typically look at in terms of grit,

297
00:17:47,361 --> 00:17:48,770
which is perseverance,
right?

298
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,950
We'll pride make people persevere
more on tasks that are difficult.

299
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:58,020
Now I know what you're thinking.
Probably Pride, gratitude, compassion.

300
00:17:58,021 --> 00:18:02,490
I kind of get where does pride fit in
by pride, I'm not meaning in arrogant,

301
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:06,480
humoristic sense of pride thinking you
have skills that you don't have it.

302
00:18:06,481 --> 00:18:09,150
I'm not trying to be political,
he's just the biggest example right now.

303
00:18:09,151 --> 00:18:09,780
But there are,

304
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:14,190
there are certainly Democrats who
fit this bill as much as Republicans.

305
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:16,680
But what I mean by pride
is actually having,

306
00:18:16,681 --> 00:18:20,910
having pride in skills that you have
worked hard to develop and others

307
00:18:20,911 --> 00:18:23,610
recognizing you for,
for working hard to develop.

308
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:29,140
So we ran an experiment where we brought
people in and um, we had them, uh,

309
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:32,600
do this task on what we
called visual spacial ability.

310
00:18:32,601 --> 00:18:35,070
It's kind of like mental
rotation and these things.

311
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:38,700
And then we gave them feedback,
sorry, in, in, in the first condition.

312
00:18:38,701 --> 00:18:41,580
We didn't give them any feedback.
And then we gave them a second task,

313
00:18:41,581 --> 00:18:43,950
which you said is related to
your visual spatial ability.

314
00:18:43,951 --> 00:18:45,240
It's really hard and difficult.

315
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:50,310
Please work on it as long as
you can in a second condition.

316
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:53,490
We gave them feedback on how
they did on the first test,

317
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:56,580
the first visual spacial test,
we said, oh, you did very well.

318
00:18:56,581 --> 00:19:00,840
You scored in the 94th percentile.
We showed them what that meant, um,

319
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:03,960
and then let them do another task.
But in the third condition,

320
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,720
we not only let them know they did well,

321
00:19:06,721 --> 00:19:09,450
but we made them feel proud of
this ability because let's face it,

322
00:19:09,451 --> 00:19:12,780
most people don't really care
about their visual spacial ability.

323
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:16,140
And so we wanted to make them feel
proud. And so we told them is, look,

324
00:19:16,141 --> 00:19:19,590
this is really important skill. I mean
this, you know, you've done really well.

325
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:23,070
The experimenter gave them kind of a pat
on the back end kind of nonverbals that

326
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,120
this is really good.

327
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:28,260
We then compared how long
they worked on these tasks.

328
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:33,210
And what you found is there
were no difference between
the folks who didn't get

329
00:19:33,211 --> 00:19:36,450
any feedback and people who told who
were told that they did okay on the task.

330
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,450
But the people who are made to feel proud,

331
00:19:39,451 --> 00:19:44,070
persevered for 40% longer
on that next difficult task.

332
00:19:44,370 --> 00:19:44,791
Why?

333
00:19:44,791 --> 00:19:49,410
Because the pride pushes them to value
the goal of getting better at something

334
00:19:49,411 --> 00:19:52,530
that those around you or
you yourself value, right?

335
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:56,940
It gave them the grit to keep going,
to keep studying, to keep working,

336
00:19:56,941 --> 00:19:59,340
to keep exercising,
whatever it may be.

337
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:03,690
Compassion works similarly. Um, you know,

338
00:20:03,691 --> 00:20:06,090
when I was researching this book on,
on self control,

339
00:20:06,091 --> 00:20:08,250
I thought I need to go
straight to the top.

340
00:20:08,251 --> 00:20:12,660
Who knows more about self control than
Buddhist monks? Probably not anybody,

341
00:20:12,661 --> 00:20:16,200
right? A lot of Buddhism is about,
about detachment from desire.

342
00:20:16,201 --> 00:20:19,500
And so a friend of mine is a
high ranking, um, Buddhist Lama.

343
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:25,070
And he told me that when monks first
take their vows to be chaste and to not

344
00:20:25,201 --> 00:20:26,700
gamble and to not drink,

345
00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:30,840
they fell a lot just like the rest of us
because they're relying on willpower to

346
00:20:30,841 --> 00:20:33,270
do it. But over time, through meditation,

347
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:36,480
it begins to unleash this
feeling of compassion in them.

348
00:20:36,481 --> 00:20:39,720
And when they feel compassion,
suddenly it becomes very easily,

349
00:20:39,721 --> 00:20:43,320
suddenly the temptations
fall away. Now, if you

350
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:48,460
read the New York Times or the Atlantic,
you're going to hear that, uh, you know,

351
00:20:48,461 --> 00:20:51,160
meditation has all these great things
for you. It lowers your blood pressure,

352
00:20:51,161 --> 00:20:55,720
it increases your creativity,
um, increases your memory.

353
00:20:56,200 --> 00:21:00,640
All those are true. That's not
why it was created, right? Um,

354
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:05,910
it was created basically to help end
suffering both for yourself and for other

355
00:21:06,131 --> 00:21:08,920
people to make people more altruistic.

356
00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:14,020
And so to show you that it actually can
evoke compassion and make people willing

357
00:21:14,021 --> 00:21:16,090
to engage in self control.
We wanted to run an experiment.

358
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:19,130
We brought people in for eight weeks,
um,

359
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:24,630
39 people from the Boston area and they
were going to take part in a meditation

360
00:21:24,731 --> 00:21:26,890
experiment and um,

361
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:31,540
they were either you're put on a wait
list so they didn't meditate or they came

362
00:21:31,541 --> 00:21:34,010
in once a week to train,
uh,

363
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:37,840
and be treated by a Buddhist Lama and
were given mp3s to take home and practice.

364
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,420
The end of those three weeks,
we had them come to our lab.

365
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:42,660
We told them we're going to have,
um,

366
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:48,940
do memory tests on you. That really
wasn't true. Um, when they came in,

367
00:21:48,941 --> 00:21:51,610
the true experiment happened in
the labs waiting room, right?

368
00:21:51,611 --> 00:21:56,260
So there were three chairs in the labs
waiting room to more occupied by actors,

369
00:21:56,261 --> 00:21:57,310
people who worked for us.

370
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:01,160
And so the subject would come in
and they would of course sit down.

371
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:04,870
The third share, a few
minutes later, another actor,

372
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:09,550
actress actually came in
and, um, she was on crutches.

373
00:22:09,551 --> 00:22:12,970
She had her foot and one of those ankle
boots you wear when your foot is broken.

374
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:17,560
She's coming down the hall and she's
wincing in pain. She walks into the room.

375
00:22:17,561 --> 00:22:20,950
The two people who are there in the chair,
I was already ignore her. We told them,

376
00:22:20,951 --> 00:22:25,060
you know, thumb your cell phones,
just, you know, don't pay any mind.

377
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:28,900
The question then was what
would the subject actually do?

378
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:33,380
Now this is a situation where it's known
to make it very hard to help as we call

379
00:22:33,381 --> 00:22:37,090
bystanders situation. And
you see it unfortunately on
the streets a lot. You know,

380
00:22:37,091 --> 00:22:37,761
I mean there,

381
00:22:37,761 --> 00:22:41,050
there are people who there could be a
homeless individual who looks like they're

382
00:22:41,051 --> 00:22:43,360
in need.
Everybody's just walking by.

383
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:46,480
And that makes it easier for
everybody else to just walk by.

384
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:48,610
Because if nobody's helping this person,
why should I?

385
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:51,250
And so we set up a similar situation.

386
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:56,170
What would the person who was
meditating for eight weeks or not do?

387
00:22:56,920 --> 00:23:00,470
And so what we find is a
pretty large effect. So a,

388
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,500
among those who didn't meditate,
right,

389
00:23:02,501 --> 00:23:05,980
three out of 19 decided
that they would get up,

390
00:23:06,310 --> 00:23:09,790
sacrifice their own comfort to give
this chair to relieve somebody else's

391
00:23:09,791 --> 00:23:10,624
discomfort.

392
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:15,190
We boosted that to 50% after
eight weeks of meditation.

393
00:23:15,670 --> 00:23:19,000
Now this is a small sample.
So we wanted to run it again.

394
00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:23,650
We also were interested in scalability.
Right? And the problem with this is yeah,

395
00:23:23,651 --> 00:23:24,610
meditation can work this way,

396
00:23:24,611 --> 00:23:28,900
but lots of people don't have access to
a Buddhist Lama or the time or money to

397
00:23:28,901 --> 00:23:32,670
do this. Uh, and so we
partnered with, um, headspace,

398
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:35,440
which was an app for your smartphone.
And the reason we used headspace,

399
00:23:35,441 --> 00:23:38,980
Andy Puddicombe actually has a lot
of monastic training. And so we,

400
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:42,130
we figured he knew what he was doing.
So around the experiment, again,

401
00:23:42,131 --> 00:23:45,800
we had 56 people. Uh, we
had them for three weeks,

402
00:23:45,801 --> 00:23:50,760
do either headspace or Lumosity. It was
billed as a cognitive training course. Um,

403
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:56,360
and then we had them do the same
experiment in the lab and we found,

404
00:23:56,380 --> 00:24:00,890
uh, a similar effect that is, uh,
people in the control condition.

405
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:02,570
Four out of 29,

406
00:24:02,571 --> 00:24:06,590
we're willing to get up and help
this other person versus, um,

407
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:10,790
10 out of 27.
So again,

408
00:24:10,970 --> 00:24:15,020
a fairly large boost in the people
who are willing to sacrifice their own

409
00:24:15,021 --> 00:24:19,310
comfort to help somebody else. How
does that relate to self control? Well,

410
00:24:19,311 --> 00:24:21,320
we wanted to look at self
control in a different domain.

411
00:24:21,321 --> 00:24:23,240
And that is the domain of aggression,
right?

412
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:27,410
And sometimes you get angry at people,
um, you want to lash out at them.

413
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:31,550
And that may not be a good strategy for
a number of reasons and it takes self

414
00:24:31,551 --> 00:24:36,020
control to not do that.
So we brought 46 people into the study.

415
00:24:36,021 --> 00:24:40,190
We had them again, do headspace, half
of them do headspace for three weeks.

416
00:24:40,610 --> 00:24:44,480
Um, and then I'm going to skip talking
about this strip. Part of the experiment.

417
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:48,410
We had them do this experiment where
they thought they were going to prepare

418
00:24:48,411 --> 00:24:51,230
speeches for each other.
So you would prepare a speech,

419
00:24:51,231 --> 00:24:54,980
then you would deliver it to
somebody else via video. Of course,

420
00:24:54,981 --> 00:24:57,410
the other person was actually
an actor who worked for us.

421
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:01,640
And so you would write your little speech
about your life goals and you'd give

422
00:25:01,641 --> 00:25:04,640
it to this person. And that person's
job was to give you feedback.

423
00:25:05,030 --> 00:25:09,530
And basically that person, um, would
say basically, this is terrible.

424
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:14,480
You know, I can't believe these are your
goals. What do you, what are you doing?

425
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:15,410
Right? And so this was, uh,

426
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:20,060
this was a strategy of paradigm developed
by Tom Tom Denson and he's shown that

427
00:25:20,061 --> 00:25:23,810
it reliably evokes anger and frustration
and people both in what they say and in

428
00:25:23,811 --> 00:25:27,860
terms of their blood pressure and their
heart rate and lots of other things.

429
00:25:28,370 --> 00:25:31,460
And so after we did
this, we told them, okay,

430
00:25:31,461 --> 00:25:34,580
now we're moving to a
taste perception study.

431
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:38,420
We want you to prepare taste samples for
each other and we're going to measure

432
00:25:38,510 --> 00:25:41,000
your, uh, taste acuity. Um,

433
00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:45,800
today we're doing hot sauce samples and
so we give them this evil bottle of hot

434
00:25:45,801 --> 00:25:48,950
sauce, like was labeled really
hot. And we told them, okay,

435
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:53,980
you have to prepare the sample for each
other and the amount that you put in the

436
00:25:54,441 --> 00:25:58,220
couple we placed in its entirety
in the person's mouth. Now again,

437
00:25:58,221 --> 00:26:01,910
this wasn't developed by
us. This is another strategy
that you use in the lab to,

438
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:04,970
to understand aggression.
The person doesn't actually drink it,

439
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:08,600
but it's actually a way of,
people know this is going to cause pain.

440
00:26:08,601 --> 00:26:11,070
They can control how much
they're going to do. A,

441
00:26:11,190 --> 00:26:14,390
and you can get a measure of that
without actually causing any pain.

442
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:18,350
So what do we see?
So people who didn't meditate,

443
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:23,380
they were kind of angry and they poured
seven grams of hot sauce into this cup.

444
00:26:23,481 --> 00:26:26,570
Now when they're not angry, so we've done
this experiment. People aren't angry.

445
00:26:26,571 --> 00:26:29,780
The average amount people pouring in is
about one to two grounds because they

446
00:26:29,781 --> 00:26:33,360
know they've got to put something in
there for the taste. Sample sevens. Hello?

447
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:37,910
[inaudible] what happened to the
people who, who meditated? Okay.

448
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:42,500
They had a lot more self control. They
poured a lot less. Yes, they were angry,

449
00:26:42,501 --> 00:26:43,830
they said were angry,

450
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:49,250
but they were more able to control
their impulses to lash out.

451
00:26:49,831 --> 00:26:52,710
And ultimately this is another way of
valuing the future because what happens

452
00:26:52,711 --> 00:26:57,380
when you lash out is you tend to engage
in tit for tat escalations of vials.

453
00:26:57,381 --> 00:26:58,770
So that's just to show you that,
you know,

454
00:26:58,771 --> 00:27:01,110
meditation is one way to
kind of boost these emotions.

455
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:05,160
Compassion beyond that has been showed
people the more often people feel

456
00:27:05,161 --> 00:27:05,701
compassion,

457
00:27:05,701 --> 00:27:08,790
both for others and themselves has been
tied to better performance on the job.

458
00:27:08,791 --> 00:27:11,820
And in school more exercise,
healthier, eating, lower consumerism,

459
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,520
less tobacco and alcohol use.
Again,

460
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:18,420
we're seeing the more often you experience
these emotions leading to greater

461
00:27:18,930 --> 00:27:19,950
self control.

462
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:24,360
Now the benefit of using emotional
strategies is they don't work from the top

463
00:27:24,361 --> 00:27:28,860
down. We're not always reminding ourselves
or resist this goal. I mean, sorry,

464
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:32,280
resist this temptation so you can
achieve your goal. They're not stressful.

465
00:27:32,281 --> 00:27:33,114
There's no fight.

466
00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:37,590
They work from the bottom up by
making us value the future more.

467
00:27:38,010 --> 00:27:41,010
They ease us into persevering toward it.

468
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:43,560
If we value our future goals more,

469
00:27:43,561 --> 00:27:47,520
it's not a struggle to want to pursue
them and to be willing to accept

470
00:27:47,521 --> 00:27:51,870
sacrifices to obtain them. And so yeah,
there are different ways to get there.

471
00:27:51,871 --> 00:27:55,890
There are cognitive
strategies like willpower and
precommitment and Planning and

472
00:27:55,891 --> 00:27:56,724
distraction,

473
00:27:56,760 --> 00:28:00,390
but there are emotional strategies
and for the reasons I've told you,

474
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:03,690
I think the emotional strategies
are the stronger ones.

475
00:28:03,930 --> 00:28:06,690
But there's one last benefit I want
to tell you about before I end,

476
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:08,460
and that is these,

477
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:13,590
using these pro social emotions actually
addresses another big problem of modern

478
00:28:13,591 --> 00:28:17,820
life, which is the plague of
loneliness. Consider this.

479
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:22,821
In 1985 80% of Americans reported that
they had at least one friend that they

480
00:28:23,071 --> 00:28:26,310
could rely on and share things
with and felt comfortable with.

481
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:30,510
By 2005 that had dropped to 57% today,

482
00:28:30,511 --> 00:28:34,230
53% of Americans regularly
report that they feel lonely,

483
00:28:34,231 --> 00:28:36,390
especially at work in
their professional lives.

484
00:28:36,391 --> 00:28:38,710
And one thing we know
from work by John Kasey,

485
00:28:38,711 --> 00:28:40,710
Opo is a psychologist at
University of Chicago,

486
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:44,130
is that loneliness is as
bad for you as smoking.

487
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:48,600
It will lower your life
expectancy to the same extent.

488
00:28:48,870 --> 00:28:51,870
It is a detriment,
your psychological wellbeing,

489
00:28:51,871 --> 00:28:55,260
and to your physical health because
of the stress that it causes.

490
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:57,713
Now,

491
00:28:59,490 --> 00:29:01,980
when you think about how
people pursue their goals,

492
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:07,320
I think the way we tend to pursue
them is in a very kind of atomistic

493
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:10,860
individualized ways.
We're putting our nose to the grindstone.

494
00:29:11,310 --> 00:29:15,180
We're just focused on what we want to do,
and we're studying hard,

495
00:29:15,181 --> 00:29:19,110
we're working hard, and we're not
thinking about our social connections.

496
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:23,100
So there's a famous statistic
related, uh, to grit out there,

497
00:29:23,101 --> 00:29:28,101
which says that kids who scored higher
on the Grit scale actually perform better

498
00:29:28,711 --> 00:29:33,210
in high stakes things. One being here, the
uh, spelling bee, national spelling bee.

499
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:36,210
But there's a cautionary
element in there too.

500
00:29:36,211 --> 00:29:39,990
If you look at the final round
of data, right? I'm sorry,

501
00:29:39,991 --> 00:29:41,250
the final round.

502
00:29:41,710 --> 00:29:46,330
Who won in the final round who performed
well once you can stroll for the kids?

503
00:29:46,331 --> 00:29:49,780
Verbal Iq is grit didn't predict anything.
Well,

504
00:29:49,781 --> 00:29:54,040
it did predict one thing and that one
thing was spending more time drilling and

505
00:29:54,041 --> 00:29:58,780
studying. Okay. And what that
suggest is not that grid is bad.

506
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:00,820
Having Grit,
valuing our goals,

507
00:30:00,821 --> 00:30:03,430
having a passion to pursue
them is hugely important.

508
00:30:03,431 --> 00:30:04,960
And I don't mean to suggest it's not,

509
00:30:05,530 --> 00:30:08,080
but there are lots of ways
that you can be gritty.

510
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:13,920
You can do it in a way that's nose to
the grindstone isolation or you can do it

511
00:30:14,021 --> 00:30:17,830
by cultivating these moral emotions,
which I think will solve a problem.

512
00:30:18,370 --> 00:30:21,130
Because when you cultivate these emotions,

513
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:26,680
what they tend to do is
increase your social network.

514
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:29,500
So one thing we know about people
who are high in this trait called

515
00:30:29,501 --> 00:30:32,570
conscientiousness, which is um, uh,

516
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:35,410
kind of being focused on always doing
the right thing and monitoring what's

517
00:30:35,411 --> 00:30:37,000
going on and being detailed oriented,

518
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:39,700
using willpower to make sure you do the
right thing. And it's like, it's almost,

519
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:41,680
it's almost perfectly
correlated with grit.

520
00:30:41,681 --> 00:30:44,050
So those who are high on
conscientiousness are high end grip.

521
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:49,120
These people do fail less cause they're
working hard. But when they fell,

522
00:30:50,710 --> 00:30:54,670
the hit to their wellbeing as
120% greater than the rest of us.

523
00:30:54,970 --> 00:30:59,560
And the reason I think why that is is
because they don't have that social

524
00:30:59,561 --> 00:31:02,260
network to capture them when they fall.

525
00:31:04,030 --> 00:31:07,180
Now if you use these emotions
to build your success,

526
00:31:07,570 --> 00:31:12,280
to help you persevere, you can't
help but build those bonds. Right?

527
00:31:12,281 --> 00:31:14,230
We have lots of other work that
I'm not going to talk about today,

528
00:31:14,231 --> 00:31:19,180
that people who experience gratitude
more often have better friendships,

529
00:31:19,181 --> 00:31:23,020
higher quality, social lives,
compassion and warmth. Um,

530
00:31:23,170 --> 00:31:24,670
or one of the first things that the,

531
00:31:24,671 --> 00:31:28,870
that we look for and who we want to be
friends with and that our mind notices

532
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:32,800
pride, a true fried and your
skills not being an arrogant,

533
00:31:32,801 --> 00:31:36,730
but taking pride in your work and
your ability is very attractive.

534
00:31:36,731 --> 00:31:40,810
It makes other people want to work
with you and even see you as a leader.

535
00:31:41,170 --> 00:31:45,970
So by cultivating these emotions, they
not only help you achieve your own goals,

536
00:31:45,971 --> 00:31:49,900
they help you automatically build
a social network around you.

537
00:31:50,130 --> 00:31:51,890
And if you think about it, it
makes a lot of sense, right?

538
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:56,080
Why did self control of all self control
didn't evolve to help you save for your

539
00:31:56,081 --> 00:32:01,081
401k to exercise or to even
get a second marshmallow?

540
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:07,120
Selfcontrol evolved originally to
help us with social connection,

541
00:32:07,451 --> 00:32:11,410
right? For, for Millennia,
401k is the whole 30,

542
00:32:11,411 --> 00:32:14,890
whatever it might be.
They didn't exist, right?

543
00:32:14,891 --> 00:32:19,570
What made human successful was
having good character, right?

544
00:32:19,810 --> 00:32:22,330
Being fair, being honest, being generous,

545
00:32:22,331 --> 00:32:27,070
being willing to accept some sacrifice
on your own to help other people.

546
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:32,190
Having those bonds is what ensured success
for most of our evolutionary history.

547
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:35,230
And these were the
emotions that underlied it.

548
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:39,350
So now what we can do is take these
same emotions that made us willing to in

549
00:32:39,351 --> 00:32:43,720
other people and pivot their power to
make us willing to cooperate with it helps

550
00:32:43,721 --> 00:32:46,370
someone else who's very important to us.

551
00:32:46,730 --> 00:32:49,250
And that is our own future self.

552
00:32:50,390 --> 00:32:52,820
And if you follow this route,
right,

553
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:57,590
what I like to say is it not only gives
you grit but grace, right? That is,

554
00:32:57,591 --> 00:33:00,950
it helps get rid of this dichotomy that
David Brooks likes to talk about between

555
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:04,070
resume virtues and eulogy virtues.

556
00:33:04,071 --> 00:33:06,260
Resume virtues are those that
you need for your career.

557
00:33:06,261 --> 00:33:08,990
Eulogy ones are the ones that
you want to be remembered for.

558
00:33:09,590 --> 00:33:12,410
By following this route,
you're going to maximize both.

559
00:33:12,710 --> 00:33:17,710
And what that will do is ensure that
you'll have a balanced and a resilient

560
00:33:18,861 --> 00:33:21,920
success. And at the end of
your life, when you look back,

561
00:33:22,370 --> 00:33:23,630
you're going to have less regrets.

562
00:33:24,950 --> 00:33:29,870
So thank you for coming and listening
and I'm happy to talk with you about any

563
00:33:29,871 --> 00:33:31,040
questions you might have.

564
00:33:48,190 --> 00:33:49,520
Sure.
Um,

565
00:33:49,670 --> 00:33:53,420
did you do any studies about maybe
more negative emotions driving success,

566
00:33:53,421 --> 00:33:56,720
like being vindictive or
anything like that? Ah, okay.

567
00:33:56,721 --> 00:34:00,310
I thought you can say something else.
So yeah. So, so if, if people say, um,

568
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:06,220
should I be a nice guy or should I be
kind of vindictive and out for myself to

569
00:34:06,921 --> 00:34:11,150
succeed? I say, well, it depends on
your timeframe. So in the short run,

570
00:34:11,450 --> 00:34:14,570
being a jerk, being a cheater, being
someone who is, we'll explore it.

571
00:34:14,571 --> 00:34:19,070
Other people's will quickly allow
you to recruit resources over time,

572
00:34:19,071 --> 00:34:23,720
both in the workplace and in evolutionary
models that people like Martin Nowak,

573
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:26,840
um, who's a evolutionary
biologist at Harvard if run,

574
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:31,530
what we see is that individuals
who are willing to, uh,

575
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:36,290
be compassionate and trustworthy and
gratitude and to share and cooperate

576
00:34:36,291 --> 00:34:41,030
honestly over time garner the most
resources. Because if you're a jerk,

577
00:34:41,690 --> 00:34:42,950
yes.
In the short run you can,

578
00:34:42,951 --> 00:34:45,920
you can cheat people out of stuff
and take credit for stuff in prosper.

579
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:51,080
But over time that reputation will
come back to haunt you. Um, yeah,

580
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:55,450
that was just curious what you thought I
was going to say and what, yeah, what I,

581
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:58,700
what I thought you were going to say is,
are there negative emotions that,

582
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:02,480
that are kind of moral emotions like
guilt that would actually motivate you to

583
00:35:02,481 --> 00:35:04,220
behave in ways and in it's true.

584
00:35:04,221 --> 00:35:07,920
So if you're guilty it will
motivate you to have self control.

585
00:35:07,921 --> 00:35:09,130
If you're worried about being embarrassed,

586
00:35:09,131 --> 00:35:10,730
it will motivate you to have self control.

587
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:15,680
But the problem is those are also
very stressful emotions to experience.

588
00:35:15,681 --> 00:35:20,681
So guilt and shame and embarrassment
have a role to play in the social world.

589
00:35:21,381 --> 00:35:25,190
They're, they're, they, they make us
behave in certain ways. It's kind of a,

590
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:28,340
a psychological kick in the pants,

591
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:32,390
but they're not something that you want
to cultivate regularly because it will

592
00:35:32,391 --> 00:35:33,830
be stressful to your body to do it,

593
00:35:33,831 --> 00:35:35,570
which is why I focus on
these more positive ones.

594
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:40,630
Hey there. Um, so one question I had is,

595
00:35:40,631 --> 00:35:44,950
so you talked a lot about the
importance of um, uh, meditation,

596
00:35:44,951 --> 00:35:47,710
which inherently is about being
present and sort of calming your mind.

597
00:35:47,711 --> 00:35:51,550
And I'm thinking about
gratitude and compassion and
pride is sort of like how do,

598
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:55,630
how do you really sort of be in the moment
with where you are and appreciate it

599
00:35:55,631 --> 00:35:56,261
and kind of,
you know,

600
00:35:56,261 --> 00:35:58,870
half of the different sort of
emotions that go along with it.

601
00:35:59,110 --> 00:36:03,010
But also fundamentally you talked a lot
about the importance of goals and being

602
00:36:03,011 --> 00:36:07,720
fortunate few future looking and utilizing
the future as a means to manage how

603
00:36:07,721 --> 00:36:08,650
you think about the present.

604
00:36:08,970 --> 00:36:12,820
Like there's a bit of tension there in
terms of like how much should you be

605
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:17,530
utilizing the future as a reference point
and be like, I want to achieve this.

606
00:36:17,531 --> 00:36:18,850
I've decided I wanted to achieve it.

607
00:36:18,851 --> 00:36:23,140
I'm going to put it away for now and
focus on the moment versus keep going back

608
00:36:23,141 --> 00:36:27,550
to the future as a way to kind of dictate
how you, how you live in the present.

609
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:28,470
Could you just talk about that?

610
00:36:28,530 --> 00:36:32,580
Yeah, I think I'm, I'm, I'm, I've got
what you're asking if I don't correct me,

611
00:36:32,581 --> 00:36:36,810
but the beauty about these
emotions, right, is they, is, they,

612
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:40,740
unlike kind of making the five year plan
and always being focused on where am I,

613
00:36:40,741 --> 00:36:45,741
what am I doing is they simply give you
patients in any realm and they simply

614
00:36:47,731 --> 00:36:50,310
make it willing that whenever
you're confronted with a decision,

615
00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:54,480
do I want to do something
that is in line with my goals?

616
00:36:54,481 --> 00:36:55,620
Whatever those goals may be,

617
00:36:55,621 --> 00:37:00,540
or do I want to do something that is
fun but detrimental to those goals?

618
00:37:00,930 --> 00:37:05,930
They increased the mind's value of
the future goal and thereby reduce the

619
00:37:06,721 --> 00:37:09,810
tension and the fight that you're going
to engage in to try and make yourself,

620
00:37:09,890 --> 00:37:13,620
um, pursue them. But the
beauty of them is, is,

621
00:37:13,650 --> 00:37:16,350
is you're not always having
to think about the future.

622
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:20,400
Simply feeling these emotions
automatically recalibrates
what you're willing to

623
00:37:20,401 --> 00:37:24,750
do. So as an example, when, um,
we make people feel grateful,

624
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:30,200
they're more willing to make decisions
like financial decisions that have, um,

625
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:34,380
delayed returns that benefit themselves
and everybody else. But at the same time,

626
00:37:34,381 --> 00:37:38,550
they're more likely to want
to help people. They're more
likely to be willing to,

627
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:42,600
to, to make a dietary choices
that are healthy for them.

628
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:43,860
And what it does is it is,

629
00:37:43,861 --> 00:37:47,250
it kind of not only calms your
desire for immediate gratification,

630
00:37:47,790 --> 00:37:52,230
but makes you non-consciously
value the future.

631
00:37:52,231 --> 00:37:54,690
So it's not like you're actually,
you have to stop and say, okay,

632
00:37:55,830 --> 00:37:59,670
I want to work hardness.
I better be grateful this silhouette.

633
00:37:59,671 --> 00:38:03,290
I can work hard on this. It kind of just
unfolds. And what do emotions do? They,

634
00:38:03,291 --> 00:38:06,150
they just shape what you're going to do
next without you having to think about

635
00:38:06,151 --> 00:38:06,840
it.
As,

636
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:11,840
I think cultivating these emotions allows
you to behave in ways that are more

637
00:38:14,221 --> 00:38:18,810
beneficial to your future without having
to always consciously think about what

638
00:38:18,811 --> 00:38:22,560
those ways are. Does that
make sense? Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

639
00:38:23,710 --> 00:38:24,543
Yeah.

640
00:38:25,230 --> 00:38:28,620
Hi. Uh, do you have any suggestions
for exercises other than meditation?

641
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:34,140
Yeah. Yeah. So, right. So how do we do
these? So, um, for gratitude it's, it's,

642
00:38:34,141 --> 00:38:35,460
it's pretty easy mean.

643
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:40,210
What we do in our experience oftentimes
is have people do gratitude journaling

644
00:38:40,211 --> 00:38:41,220
or gratitude diaries.

645
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:44,080
You take five minutes a day every other
day thinking about something you're

646
00:38:44,081 --> 00:38:44,621
grateful for.

647
00:38:44,621 --> 00:38:48,550
The trick of course is we all have three
or four things that we're immensely

648
00:38:48,551 --> 00:38:52,300
grateful for. And if you think about
the same three or four things every day,

649
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:55,030
they're going to lose their power. And
so what you have to do this, think about,

650
00:38:55,031 --> 00:38:55,720
you know,

651
00:38:55,720 --> 00:39:00,040
the guy who gave you directions today or
the woman who gave you her seat on the

652
00:39:00,041 --> 00:39:04,870
subway or somebody who helped you out here
at your work at Google during the day.

653
00:39:04,871 --> 00:39:07,870
It doesn't have to be something
that's amazingly, you're grateful for.

654
00:39:07,871 --> 00:39:12,190
Even mild levels of gratitude do the same
thing. Compassion besides meditation,

655
00:39:12,191 --> 00:39:15,580
one thing that we know works is
looking for links with other people.

656
00:39:15,581 --> 00:39:20,080
So we do other work where we bring people
together and we just have them find

657
00:39:20,081 --> 00:39:23,530
some common link.
They like the same sports team.

658
00:39:23,531 --> 00:39:27,910
They liked the same music, they have a
friend in common, whatever it might be.

659
00:39:28,330 --> 00:39:32,050
Just simply knowing that you have a link
with other people makes the mind more

660
00:39:32,051 --> 00:39:34,810
willing to feel compassion
for that person.

661
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:39,480
And so a way to do that on a daily basis
is to stop and try and just everyday

662
00:39:39,490 --> 00:39:42,880
put yourself in somebody's shoes
and feel an emotion for them.

663
00:39:42,881 --> 00:39:47,881
The magic part about this is if I feel
compassion for you by trying to put

664
00:39:47,981 --> 00:39:51,370
myself in your shoes and perspective
taking and think what it's like and how it

665
00:39:51,371 --> 00:39:52,204
could help you,

666
00:39:52,270 --> 00:39:57,070
that compassion will bleed over and it
will make me help my own future self and

667
00:39:57,071 --> 00:39:58,030
other people as well.

668
00:39:58,030 --> 00:40:01,750
It's like if I'm grateful because
Allen did something for me,

669
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:05,890
our work shows that it also makes me
much more likely to pay it forward and

670
00:40:05,891 --> 00:40:07,890
helping the next person who is there.
I mean emotions you,

671
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:11,020
when you think about it, when you're
frightened of something, you know you're,

672
00:40:11,021 --> 00:40:13,150
you're frightened and then
you hear like a scary,

673
00:40:13,151 --> 00:40:16,360
you hear a creak in your house and
you're like, oh, I'm afraid of that.

674
00:40:16,361 --> 00:40:19,000
Because they're setting the
expectation for what you do next.

675
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:21,460
If you're feeling gratitude or compassion,

676
00:40:21,461 --> 00:40:23,620
they set the expectation for
what you're going to do next,

677
00:40:23,621 --> 00:40:26,200
even if it's not related to what
you're thinking about in the moment.

678
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:27,430
Same thing for pride.

679
00:40:27,431 --> 00:40:31,320
Don't take pride only an ultimately
reaching your goal because that's a long

680
00:40:31,321 --> 00:40:34,840
time away. Take pride in kind of
each little step along the way.

681
00:40:34,841 --> 00:40:37,330
Don't engage in self criticism
for not getting there sooner.

682
00:40:37,870 --> 00:40:40,870
Have kind of pride and self
compassion for yourself along the way.

683
00:40:40,990 --> 00:40:42,640
Those are some easy strategies to do.

684
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:48,230
So read it to combustion and bridal.

685
00:40:48,231 --> 00:40:50,390
Definitely positive emotions
that all people feel.

686
00:40:50,870 --> 00:40:53,900
And my question is how did you
come up with a specific list?

687
00:40:53,901 --> 00:40:56,760
Because there are a lot more humility.
They respect trust law.

688
00:40:57,850 --> 00:41:00,910
Yeah. So for me, um,
these are the emotions,

689
00:41:00,911 --> 00:41:02,560
and I'm not saying
these are the only ones,

690
00:41:02,770 --> 00:41:07,300
but these are the emotions that underlie
cooperation.

691
00:41:07,390 --> 00:41:10,660
And we owe me ultimately what is
human life about human morality,

692
00:41:10,661 --> 00:41:13,900
about it's about cooperation. Why
do we cooperate? Because we can,

693
00:41:13,901 --> 00:41:16,720
we can do more together than we can alone.

694
00:41:16,721 --> 00:41:19,960
And so these are the emotions that I call
social emotions that exist only within

695
00:41:19,961 --> 00:41:23,690
the context of social interaction.
Um,

696
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:26,080
I think love works the same way.

697
00:41:26,170 --> 00:41:29,650
I just think love's not as
easy to do because you can't,

698
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:34,580
it's harder to cultivate love and a
basis for somebody you don't know.

699
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:37,640
Um, but love is a very powerful emotion
mean. When you think about grit,

700
00:41:37,641 --> 00:41:39,050
what is grit? You know,
people talk about, oh,

701
00:41:39,051 --> 00:41:42,290
the person who worked hard to
get ahead of the CEO. To me,

702
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:43,940
people who have grit are,
you know,

703
00:41:43,941 --> 00:41:48,941
the mom who works three jobs so
she can support her kid in college.

704
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:51,200
Or the grandfather who has emphysema,

705
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:56,150
who's dragging the oxygen tank behind
him to go see his grandchild play on the

706
00:41:56,151 --> 00:41:59,600
soccer field. I mean, to me that's
where grit really comes from.

707
00:41:59,601 --> 00:42:02,750
It's a willingness to sacrifice and I'm
sure we can pivot it to our own success.

708
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:07,070
And so I think these three emotions are
some of the primary ones. I don't think,

709
00:42:07,071 --> 00:42:09,650
I mean trust, respect, those
things are hugely important.

710
00:42:09,651 --> 00:42:13,760
They're not really emotions.
Um, I think they play into it.

711
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,360
And so I think these are some of the three
strongest that are the most tractable.

712
00:42:17,361 --> 00:42:19,070
But I don't mean to say
that they're the only one.

713
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:22,170
Yeah.

714
00:42:22,170 --> 00:42:23,980
I think I was decided before anyone.
Yeah.

715
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:26,220
So you talked about,
uh,

716
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:31,260
the stress that somebody
incurs controlling their
impulses and kind of, you know,

717
00:42:31,270 --> 00:42:34,490
even the long term health
implications of this. Uh,

718
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:38,170
I'm thinking of the analogy of something
like strength training where you,

719
00:42:38,230 --> 00:42:41,110
you lift a weight and you know,
over time you get better at,

720
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:45,880
it becomes easier to do, to exert
the same end goal. I was wondering,

721
00:42:46,660 --> 00:42:48,590
does that analogy not work?
In the case of

722
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:52,680
the analogy, the analogy works
well in, in, in two ways.

723
00:42:53,130 --> 00:42:56,320
One is you're almost developing kind of a,
uh,

724
00:42:56,550 --> 00:42:59,730
a habit of doing is by
cultivating these traits. Um,

725
00:43:00,150 --> 00:43:02,280
it kind of shapes your way
of looking at the world.

726
00:43:02,550 --> 00:43:06,450
And so suddenly you begin to look for
things to be thankful for or you're

727
00:43:06,451 --> 00:43:10,380
automatically begin to look for links
to other people and have compassion for

728
00:43:10,381 --> 00:43:13,500
them. So they happen more frequently,
but they also have been more intensely.

729
00:43:13,501 --> 00:43:18,150
So there's work not mine, um, that,
uh, where they look at people who,

730
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:21,540
um, are basically giving
and paying back others.

731
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:26,400
And what they find is the simple act of,
of, of giving to pay back others, um,

732
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:29,870
activates the reward center in the brain.
So it actually is something that,

733
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:34,870
that we perceive as
rewarding to ourselves. Um,

734
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:35,580
and what we,

735
00:43:35,580 --> 00:43:39,630
what they find is that the more often
you do that for the same type of giving,

736
00:43:39,631 --> 00:43:42,720
the strength of that reward
signal goes up. So it basically,

737
00:43:42,721 --> 00:43:44,730
it's an intrinsic value
to the brain goes up.

738
00:43:44,731 --> 00:43:47,490
And so it strengthens both in
frequency and in intensity.

739
00:43:48,270 --> 00:43:49,450
And then one last thing
I want to say about,

740
00:43:49,470 --> 00:43:53,880
about how we cultivate these within
a work environment like Google or any

741
00:43:53,881 --> 00:43:54,714
corporation,

742
00:43:55,590 --> 00:43:58,830
there's two ways that these emotions flow
in networks I think is very important.

743
00:43:58,831 --> 00:44:01,440
One is like all emotions,
they're catchy. So, um,

744
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:03,030
there's this thing called
emotional contagion.

745
00:44:03,031 --> 00:44:05,610
So if you're afraid that
we'll kind of rub off on me.

746
00:44:05,611 --> 00:44:09,660
So if my coworker is feeling grateful
that gratefulness will kind of rub off on

747
00:44:09,661 --> 00:44:13,140
the same about their compassion. And so
one, you can catch them from other people,

748
00:44:13,141 --> 00:44:15,360
but the more important way
as they work reciprocally.

749
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:18,720
So if I'm feeling
compassionate toward you,

750
00:44:19,140 --> 00:44:24,030
it makes me more willing to help you
with something that you're working on for

751
00:44:24,031 --> 00:44:26,490
which you will then feel grateful to me.

752
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:28,050
And then because you're feeling grateful,

753
00:44:28,051 --> 00:44:30,990
you're more likely than the pay it forward
to somebody else who will then feel

754
00:44:31,620 --> 00:44:36,060
for you. And so you get a network
that's continually reinforcing,

755
00:44:36,061 --> 00:44:38,550
that makes not only the
team collaborate more,

756
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:42,640
but individual's willingness to,

757
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:47,010
to work hard themselves goes up and
their stress goes down. Oh, sorry.

758
00:44:47,190 --> 00:44:48,870
I keep skipping you.
Oh yeah,

759
00:44:48,930 --> 00:44:52,620
yeah. Um, I just, uh, wondering
what your thoughts are, uh,

760
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:55,050
about the dollar experiment.
Um,

761
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:58,260
and like accounting for
need in that experiment.

762
00:44:58,310 --> 00:45:02,090
You mean the one I had up
here? Yeah. Yeah. So people
always say, well, you know, if,

763
00:45:02,150 --> 00:45:06,890
if valuing the future is so important
than why does anybody value the short

764
00:45:06,891 --> 00:45:11,420
term, right? We shouldn't have even
been extinguished evolutionarily and no.

765
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:15,680
Uh, sometimes having making a short
term decision makes sense. So, um,

766
00:45:16,010 --> 00:45:18,800
if you need that money to survive,
right?

767
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:22,850
If that's a lot of money to you because
you come from maybe an economically

768
00:45:22,851 --> 00:45:27,560
disadvantaged background,
um, that can make sense. In
fact, there's work, not mine,

769
00:45:27,561 --> 00:45:31,580
but by lots of people who do
the marshmallow experiment
with kids from different

770
00:45:31,581 --> 00:45:33,260
ses backgrounds.

771
00:45:33,261 --> 00:45:37,310
What they find is kids from
ses backgrounds that are
very disadvantaged where

772
00:45:37,580 --> 00:45:41,450
they don't have a good belief that the
future is going gonna pan out or that the

773
00:45:41,451 --> 00:45:45,200
promises you make about getting money
are actually real or that they can trust

774
00:45:45,201 --> 00:45:50,000
you. They show what is believed
to be less self control, right?

775
00:45:50,001 --> 00:45:52,460
That is, they'll take the smaller
price. I'll take the marshmallow,

776
00:45:53,060 --> 00:45:56,090
but it's not really irrational
in those cases, right?

777
00:45:56,091 --> 00:45:59,780
Because if you believe that the
future is not going to come true,

778
00:46:00,470 --> 00:46:02,210
then take what you've got and run with it.

779
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:05,780
And the reason we're miscalibrated now
is because we used to live in a world

780
00:46:05,781 --> 00:46:09,740
where there was much less certainty,
right?

781
00:46:09,770 --> 00:46:11,660
I mean you didn't know if there
was going to be food tomorrow.

782
00:46:11,661 --> 00:46:12,920
So if you had a lot of food,
eat it now,

783
00:46:12,921 --> 00:46:15,290
you didn't know if certain things
were going to happen tomorrow.

784
00:46:15,291 --> 00:46:18,440
If you were going to be around tomorrow.
Now in this world,

785
00:46:19,340 --> 00:46:23,930
I know that if I buy a
CD or you know a bond,

786
00:46:23,931 --> 00:46:28,310
it's going to pay me x amount and so many
years I know if I smoke it's going to

787
00:46:28,311 --> 00:46:30,860
be bad for me. I know if I overeat,
it's going to be bad for me.

788
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:35,240
Certainty is so much higher, but our
brains haven't quite caught up with us.

789
00:46:35,241 --> 00:46:38,300
And that's why we make these irrational
decisions. But to answer your question,

790
00:46:38,301 --> 00:46:40,330
sorry for the long roundabout way is um,

791
00:46:40,450 --> 00:46:43,940
the way that we deal with this in the
research is we make sure when we assigned

792
00:46:43,941 --> 00:46:48,350
people to conditions that we balance out
all of those issues so that within all

793
00:46:48,351 --> 00:46:48,861
of my groups,

794
00:46:48,861 --> 00:46:52,790
before I make one feel grateful and
the other one feel happy and nothing,

795
00:46:53,180 --> 00:46:57,860
we're making sure that ses and need and
although things are balanced so that

796
00:46:58,260 --> 00:47:00,500
they can't be attributable
to those other causes.

797
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:03,410
But I think you're absolutely right
and that where you're starting from,

798
00:47:03,411 --> 00:47:08,120
what your background expectations are
can greatly determine what seems like a

799
00:47:08,121 --> 00:47:09,290
rational choice for you.

800
00:47:10,130 --> 00:47:12,110
Okay. Thanks. Yeah. Hi. Um,

801
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:16,250
I was wondering if you had any specific
examples of ways that managers or

802
00:47:16,251 --> 00:47:19,130
leaders have cultivated environments?
Yeah.

803
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:23,780
Gratitude and compassion that
can ultimately help a team.
Yeah. Or achieve a goal.

804
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:26,980
Well, it's funny, one of the things
I talk about in the book was a, um,

805
00:47:27,170 --> 00:47:30,760
a study done actually, um, human,

806
00:47:30,761 --> 00:47:33,550
I know it's not called human resources
at Google, I forget what it's called,

807
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:36,040
but it's basically Google human
resources and they're looking at,

808
00:47:36,041 --> 00:47:39,730
at team success. And, um, you know,
you thought, they thought, well,

809
00:47:39,731 --> 00:47:41,740
what's going to account for team's
success? And they thought, well,

810
00:47:41,770 --> 00:47:42,760
technical expertise,

811
00:47:42,761 --> 00:47:46,180
especially if the manager turned out
that wasn't the biggest predictor,

812
00:47:46,390 --> 00:47:49,620
the biggest predictor was,
was there a culture of,

813
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:53,860
of empathy on the team that videos
could people trust each other?

814
00:47:53,861 --> 00:47:56,230
Did they feel they could
support each other? Did they,

815
00:47:56,280 --> 00:48:00,970
did the manager instill in the team a
culture where it was okay and expected

816
00:48:00,971 --> 00:48:04,210
that we would talk about problems that
we were having and share with each other?

817
00:48:04,420 --> 00:48:09,070
And to the extent that they
did those teams succeeded.
Why? Well, you know, if, if,

818
00:48:09,071 --> 00:48:13,780
if, if you're working hard to kind
of develop stuff and be creative,

819
00:48:14,350 --> 00:48:16,060
there's always a risk of failure in that.

820
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:19,570
And so you have to be comfortable
that those around you are going to be

821
00:48:19,660 --> 00:48:20,910
continually to,
to,

822
00:48:20,950 --> 00:48:24,750
to support you and help and help and
rather than try and take advantage of use

823
00:48:24,751 --> 00:48:26,620
and they can climb the
ladder within the work group.

824
00:48:27,100 --> 00:48:29,230
And so I think if you're a manager,

825
00:48:29,231 --> 00:48:34,231
what you can begin to do is
to both emulate it yourself,

826
00:48:35,050 --> 00:48:39,310
but also take time within
the workflow of your,

827
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:44,440
of your team, whether once a week, once a
day, once a month, whatever it might be,

828
00:48:44,980 --> 00:48:49,980
to engage in these types of exercises
that build empathy and compassion.

829
00:48:51,611 --> 00:48:53,680
Talk about your problems,
talk about your fears,

830
00:48:53,681 --> 00:48:57,040
talk about what's working and what's not.
Another great strategy out there,

831
00:48:57,041 --> 00:49:01,690
Adam Grant often talks about
this is what's called the,
um, circle of reciprocity.

832
00:49:02,170 --> 00:49:04,380
And so what you might do as a,
as a team is,

833
00:49:04,390 --> 00:49:07,780
is you'd put up on the board
everybody's name in your work group,

834
00:49:08,020 --> 00:49:12,430
and then everybody has to write a problem
they're having at work or even not at

835
00:49:12,431 --> 00:49:17,080
work. And then everybody that has
to say, I can help you with this.

836
00:49:17,110 --> 00:49:19,720
You pick one, and you then you
put your name next to that.

837
00:49:20,020 --> 00:49:24,130
And then what you do is you draw
connections from people who've,

838
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:25,660
here's my problem.
People were willing to help.

839
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:28,120
And suddenly you see the interconnections.
If everybody does that,

840
00:49:28,121 --> 00:49:28,871
what that then does,

841
00:49:28,871 --> 00:49:32,890
it starts to automatically
instill gratitude and
compassion within the team and

842
00:49:32,891 --> 00:49:37,150
it flows forward. Yup. Hi,

843
00:49:37,151 --> 00:49:40,540
thanks for coming today.
You had a slide that said one 20%,

844
00:49:40,541 --> 00:49:43,810
something about how people with a
certain type of grit tend to fall harder.

845
00:49:43,811 --> 00:49:46,910
Could you elaborate on
that again? Yeah. So, um,

846
00:49:47,110 --> 00:49:51,970
this was a study done where it measured
people's personality trait called

847
00:49:51,971 --> 00:49:56,430
conscientiousness, which is characterized
by being someone who's very detailed,

848
00:49:56,470 --> 00:49:59,560
honored, very focused and always wanting
to do the right thing, suppressing their,

849
00:49:59,860 --> 00:50:02,770
their desires for temptations
so that they can persevere.

850
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:05,630
And if you look at the
correlation of that and grit,

851
00:50:05,650 --> 00:50:08,560
the correlation is like 0.8 something.
And so if you're high on one,

852
00:50:08,561 --> 00:50:13,050
you're high on the other. Um,
they followed these people, uh,

853
00:50:13,090 --> 00:50:16,240
and when, uh, they experienced a setback,

854
00:50:16,241 --> 00:50:20,500
which I think in this study and one of
the studies was, um, they lost their job.

855
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:24,630
So it's unemployment. How
much did that affect them? Um,

856
00:50:25,210 --> 00:50:27,800
adjusting for ses and everything else.

857
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:32,540
The hit to their wellbeing that they
reported in terms of stress and what they

858
00:50:32,541 --> 00:50:37,541
felt and how they dealt with
that was 120% more intense that,

859
00:50:38,121 --> 00:50:42,620
that their, their unease and they're
stressed then were people who were,

860
00:50:43,190 --> 00:50:46,430
who worked and pursue their goals with
a different kind of more inclusive

861
00:50:46,431 --> 00:50:47,450
emotion-based style.

862
00:50:49,340 --> 00:50:50,173
Hi.
Hi.

863
00:50:50,900 --> 00:50:55,900
That's all you talk about empathy and
compassion and especially in design.

864
00:50:57,241 --> 00:51:00,370
Empathy is such a sexy word.
Um,

865
00:51:00,840 --> 00:51:05,760
but I'm curious about your research
and if you surface any findings on

866
00:51:05,761 --> 00:51:10,560
vulnerability and how does that affect
people's ability to express gratitude,

867
00:51:10,561 --> 00:51:11,610
compassion,
and pride.

868
00:51:12,180 --> 00:51:17,100
So what do you mean by surface? Like
if I, if I show you how I'm vulnerable,

869
00:51:17,101 --> 00:51:20,820
does that make me have more compassionate
others? More compassion toward me?

870
00:51:21,310 --> 00:51:25,240
Um, I guess I'm wondering if
your participants talked about,

871
00:51:25,740 --> 00:51:30,310
um, what does it mean to be vulnerable?
Because I mean, even with like empathy,

872
00:51:30,311 --> 00:51:34,180
you can't truly be empathetic unless you
allow yourself to be vulnerable and not

873
00:51:34,181 --> 00:51:38,740
to possibly experience and trying to
understand the other side. Okay. Oh,

874
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:41,080
I'm just kinda wondering if there's
any correlation that you found.

875
00:51:41,870 --> 00:51:44,810
So we didn't,
we didn't look at vulnerability per se.

876
00:51:44,840 --> 00:51:46,730
But one thing I want to
point out as these terms,

877
00:51:46,731 --> 00:51:49,400
like empathy and compassion
are often used interchangeably.

878
00:51:49,401 --> 00:51:50,720
They're really different things.

879
00:51:51,170 --> 00:51:55,640
So empathy as you're saying is I'm
allowing myself to understand what you're

880
00:51:55,641 --> 00:51:57,290
doing and to feel what you feel.

881
00:51:57,500 --> 00:51:59,840
So if I have empathy for
you and your distressed,

882
00:51:59,841 --> 00:52:03,830
I'm going to feel that distress.
Um,

883
00:52:04,370 --> 00:52:07,160
compassion is different.
Compassion means, um,

884
00:52:07,310 --> 00:52:10,310
both in the scientific neuroscience
world and in the Buddhist world,

885
00:52:10,311 --> 00:52:13,970
it basically means that I don't
have to feel what you're feeling.

886
00:52:14,270 --> 00:52:15,680
I just have to want to help you.

887
00:52:16,340 --> 00:52:19,720
And what we find is that there is
a big difference. So people who,

888
00:52:19,721 --> 00:52:24,721
who make themselves vulnerable to kind
of allowing myself to feel your anxiety,

889
00:52:25,191 --> 00:52:29,840
your pain, your distress, whatever it may
be, can lead to burnout over time, right?

890
00:52:29,841 --> 00:52:34,220
This is why you hear people talk about
empathy, burnout among caregivers. And so,

891
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:34,730
um,

892
00:52:34,730 --> 00:52:39,730
our strategy is to help
people feel compassion,

893
00:52:39,861 --> 00:52:44,090
to want to help other people without
having to take on that pain that they're

894
00:52:44,091 --> 00:52:47,840
feeling themselves.
Because it can be paralyzing to do that.

895
00:52:48,230 --> 00:52:51,260
And it's also sometimes, you know,
the, the, the Buddhist will call,

896
00:52:51,470 --> 00:52:54,560
they'll call kind of empathy like that.
They'll call it idiot compassion.

897
00:52:54,830 --> 00:52:59,030
And what I mean by idiot compassion is
the classic example of is it is your

898
00:52:59,031 --> 00:53:04,031
child wants to do something that's like
your child wants to play with a knife

899
00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:10,070
and you say, no, you can't
play with that knife.

900
00:53:10,071 --> 00:53:14,480
And you take it away from the child. The
child starts screaming and crying, right?

901
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:15,560
Well,
in that moment,

902
00:53:15,590 --> 00:53:17,810
if you wanted to make the kid
feel better and felt compassion,

903
00:53:17,811 --> 00:53:19,550
you'd give him the knife back.
But you know,

904
00:53:19,551 --> 00:53:21,740
that's not good for that
kid's longterm health there.

905
00:53:21,741 --> 00:53:24,590
Same thing if they want to overeat cookies
or they want to go out and play and

906
00:53:24,591 --> 00:53:25,380
not study.

907
00:53:25,380 --> 00:53:29,700
And so sometimes to behave
truly compassionately,

908
00:53:29,701 --> 00:53:33,930
you have to be willing to let the other
person suffer a little bit and help them

909
00:53:33,931 --> 00:53:34,764
through it.

910
00:53:34,770 --> 00:53:38,700
But the way to do that is to not always
take that suffering on yourself in an

911
00:53:38,701 --> 00:53:41,430
empathic way. So you want other people
to know that you understand them,

912
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:45,960
but engaging in his strategy where you're
feeling what they're feeling can be

913
00:53:45,961 --> 00:53:49,710
very counterproductive.
Does that kind of answer your question?

914
00:53:49,950 --> 00:53:52,560
So then are you referring to pity?

915
00:53:53,460 --> 00:53:56,880
I guess like I kind of did the opposite
of like, empathy is like pity of like,

916
00:53:57,560 --> 00:53:58,251
no,
I think,

917
00:53:58,251 --> 00:54:01,950
I think I think of empathy as your
ability to simulate what somebody else is

918
00:54:01,951 --> 00:54:04,190
feeling and to feel it yourself.

919
00:54:04,520 --> 00:54:09,470
Whereas compassion is wanting them to
feel better and working to help them,

920
00:54:09,471 --> 00:54:11,060
but not feeling their pain.

921
00:54:11,290 --> 00:54:13,770
Hmm. Okay. Thank you. Yeah.

922
00:54:16,780 --> 00:54:17,613
Okay.

923
00:54:18,730 --> 00:54:19,690
Thank you everybody for coming.
