1
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:10,783
Yes.
Um,

2
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:16,160
I'm Andrea yet and I've
worked all my life and um,

3
00:00:16,711 --> 00:00:21,240
job has had a, required a certain degree
of numeracy, so a lot of stuff in it.

4
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:26,430
I'm a lot of stuff in insurance and
I've always regarded myself as there's a

5
00:00:26,431 --> 00:00:31,431
numerous person and I suppose this whole
project came about from frustration and

6
00:00:33,131 --> 00:00:37,830
seeing the way numbers are handled in
the media and in politics and in public

7
00:00:37,831 --> 00:00:41,160
life in general. And it
seems to me that, you know,

8
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:45,650
set your teeth on edge sometimes some
of the stuff you hear and you read, um,

9
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:48,060
and the way that numbers are
handled and sometimes this,

10
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:52,740
it's matters of sovereignty and the
way in which they, they, the, the um,

11
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,710
the things are presented.
Sometimes it's very, very basic.

12
00:00:55,711 --> 00:01:00,360
Sometimes there's just a question of
people not understanding what the scale of

13
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:05,070
a certain problem is and
small issues get magnified.

14
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,590
Large issues get, get, get, get minimized.

15
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:12,090
And it got me to thinking that sometimes
it's the question that just needs to be

16
00:01:12,091 --> 00:01:14,970
asked and answered is,
is that a big number?

17
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,420
And so I as one dice these days,

18
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:22,530
I set up my website and the website
had one function only. And that is,

19
00:01:22,531 --> 00:01:26,520
it's a single input field. You can type
in a number and press a button that says,

20
00:01:26,521 --> 00:01:27,450
is this a big number?

21
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:31,560
And it goes and we compares it to a whole
bunch of reference numbers that it's

22
00:01:31,561 --> 00:01:34,440
gotten a database and it
comes back and says, yes,

23
00:01:34,441 --> 00:01:39,230
it's 10 times the diameter of g of Jupiter
or something like that. You know, it's,

24
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:43,140
it, it, all it does is it goes back,
retrieves the number and brings up some,

25
00:01:43,141 --> 00:01:46,260
some pleasant entertaining comparisons.

26
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:52,230
But doing that work, maybe think about
the way in which we regard numbers,

27
00:01:52,231 --> 00:01:55,530
the way in which we relate to numbers of
way in which we understand numbers and

28
00:01:55,531 --> 00:01:57,720
big numbers in particular.
Um,

29
00:01:58,190 --> 00:02:02,850
I'm thinking about it when I started
writing some of this down and tense the

30
00:02:02,851 --> 00:02:07,620
book, which you see here. So
today it's all about numbers.

31
00:02:07,621 --> 00:02:09,540
It's not maths,
it's about numbers.

32
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:14,070
And the way in which we think
about and relate to numbers. Um,

33
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:18,240
I mean you guys Google,
you're the monsters of big data.

34
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:21,960
But today I want to talk a little bit
about what you could do with just a little

35
00:02:21,961 --> 00:02:24,810
bit of data and not with
high tech processing of data,

36
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:26,570
but just the stuff that
you've got in your head.

37
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:30,390
Just thinking about numbers and thinking
about how we relate to numbers and how

38
00:02:30,391 --> 00:02:34,500
we understand numbers. So how
numbers help us understand the world.

39
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:38,790
Now you may think I'm being
metaphorical there, but I'm not.

40
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:43,710
I'm going to start a fire literally
talking about the size of the earth and I

41
00:02:43,711 --> 00:02:45,380
was always told that when you do a talk,

42
00:02:45,381 --> 00:02:49,730
I guess you started with the ancient
Greeks, the ancient Greek era Toscanini's.

43
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,370
Now you may know him because of
his connection with prime numbers.

44
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:56,790
[inaudible] the way of filtering
out the compound numbers,

45
00:02:56,791 --> 00:03:00,130
leaving behind only the prime numbers,
but he was much more than that.

46
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:05,850
He was in fact the third chief librarian
at the famous library at Alexandria.

47
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:12,070
Um, and put yourself in
his position. He's there.

48
00:03:12,071 --> 00:03:14,290
This is a relatively recent institution,

49
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:18,280
been founded off to the conquest
of Alexander, the great 200 BC.

50
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,930
The scope of the world has,

51
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:24,370
his world has expanded because of this.

52
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:29,110
And he's dealing with new information
coming in from all over the place and he's

53
00:03:29,111 --> 00:03:32,590
trying to assimilate this information,
who's trying to manage it?

54
00:03:32,591 --> 00:03:37,180
He's trying to pull it into
a form of a framework.

55
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:40,780
He's trying to aggressively collect
this information and deal with it.

56
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:45,940
Does that sound familiar at all
to you guys? So there he is.

57
00:03:45,941 --> 00:03:49,930
He's running the library in Alexandria
and he's trying to make sense of the

58
00:03:49,931 --> 00:03:52,180
world and he's using numbers to do this.

59
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:57,280
Now that's a not that he made. What's
a reproduction of a map that he made

60
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:03,780
of his known world and he's known as
the parent of scientific geography.

61
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:09,550
And while we may look at that map and
think that's a little bit dodgy, um,

62
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:14,170
it represents only about an 8%
of the globe as we know it. Um,

63
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:17,440
and it's seriously deficient
when you get down to the south,

64
00:04:17,441 --> 00:04:21,640
you'll find that that word over there
on the bottom says he quite huh.

65
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:27,010
Um, and he runs out at, at
roundabout India over to the, to the,

66
00:04:27,011 --> 00:04:30,370
to the right there. And let's forget
about what's going on to the west.

67
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:34,070
But that was his known world. But there's
a lot that's going on in the trial.

68
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:37,030
So you can see around the Mediterranean
basin, they are some familiar shape,

69
00:04:37,031 --> 00:04:39,550
size and stuff. Let me put
yourself in this guy's position.

70
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:43,360
He doesn't have surveys,
he doesn't have telecommunications,

71
00:04:43,361 --> 00:04:46,900
he doesn't have measuring devices.
He's pulling this from, from stories.

72
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,920
Um,
and the thing that he introduced here,

73
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:53,200
all of these lines of
latitude and longitude.

74
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:56,590
So what he's doing is he's using numbers
to put these things into the right

75
00:04:56,591 --> 00:05:01,380
place. Now the two points that
are particularly of interest here,

76
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:03,970
that's where he is in Alexandria.

77
00:05:03,971 --> 00:05:08,971
They on the Nile Delta and down below
down south is a place called [inaudible],

78
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,790
which has a,
if you can read the word that says tropic,

79
00:05:12,791 --> 00:05:14,080
it's on the tropic of cancer.

80
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:20,340
And that means that that on
the summer solstice in Cyan,

81
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:23,020
the son would have been overhead.

82
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:27,940
So that is what he used
to measure the earth.

83
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:31,240
Now that's not just an ease,
it's called Sagan,

84
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:36,190
but he's showing you the technique
that we're tossing is used.

85
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:41,790
So you can see their insight in there
has a colon and they're up in Alexandria.

86
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:44,990
There's a column. Now when the
sun is directly overhead and so,

87
00:05:44,991 --> 00:05:49,240
and on the summer solstice,
the column costs no shadow.

88
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:54,240
The Sun shot shines directly down a
web shop or we've chuffed well shaft.

89
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:58,190
Um,
whereas in same day in Alexandria,

90
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:00,170
there is a shutter that's being cost.

91
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:03,110
Now this is because of the
curvature of the earth of course,

92
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:06,210
and that let him calculate
the size of the earth.

93
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:10,980
Geometry. Of course, it comes from the
Greek. Everything comes from the Rick,

94
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:13,760
well not everything,
but it's a measurement of earth OLED.

95
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:18,890
So he's measuring the earth units
each using or feet, how days.

96
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:24,550
And if you like footraces the stadium
was the length of the stadium and has run

97
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:29,840
200 meters, um, in, in today's terms.

98
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:35,080
And he had a measurement there from
Alexandra to of in 5,000 stadium.

99
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:40,310
If I look on Google maps,
I see that's approximately 850 kilometers.

100
00:06:40,311 --> 00:06:43,490
So you can get the equivalency.
And

101
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:49,850
of course we understand geometry
in a different way as well as, um,

102
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:54,470
shapes and styles. And sizes and so
there's a bit of geometry for you.

103
00:06:54,471 --> 00:06:58,100
There's some parallel lines coming in
the rays of the sun in the southern

104
00:06:58,101 --> 00:07:02,060
location inside [inaudible] you can see
that it's pulling directly in line with

105
00:07:02,061 --> 00:07:04,280
a column there.
Up in Alexandria there's,

106
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:09,400
there is a shadow being cost and if
you're under your geometry from school,

107
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:13,610
that angle there must be
the same as the angle there.

108
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:17,270
So if he measures the angle in Alexandria,

109
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:22,630
he can work out what proportion of the
circle of the earth that represents and

110
00:07:23,421 --> 00:07:28,220
he mentioned it to be one 50th multiply
the two together and you've got 250,000

111
00:07:28,221 --> 00:07:32,660
stadia in our terms
about 42,500 kilometers.

112
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:39,020
Now that's pretty accurate for
the time and for the techniques.

113
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:42,590
That's very accurate and
there are a couple of things
I just wanted to point out

114
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:46,940
here. One is that he's using
very simple mathematics to do.

115
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:51,410
This is only a few data points
that he needs. Secondly,

116
00:07:51,411 --> 00:07:55,220
he's got a big picture.
He's got a view of what's going on.

117
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:58,700
He's got a concept of what's going on
here that he can put those numbers into.

118
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,840
And the third thing I would eventually,
it's quite a subtle point, you know,

119
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:06,890
in a way we saw his map of the
known world, 8% of the globe.

120
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:11,330
So that was all that he knew about in
terms of places and peoples and things

121
00:08:11,331 --> 00:08:15,240
like that. But he also knew
that the world was at much big,

122
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:19,370
so he knew how much he didn't know.

123
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:24,590
And I think that's an interesting
thing to think about. Now.

124
00:08:24,591 --> 00:08:25,424
We jump forward

125
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:31,220
some 1600 years to a fellow
called Toscan Ellie in Florence.

126
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:35,840
It's also an astronomer. He's also a
mathematician. He's also geography.

127
00:08:35,841 --> 00:08:40,460
He was one of the guys behind the
development of the mathematical theory of

128
00:08:40,461 --> 00:08:43,210
perspective in the renaissance.
Um,

129
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:45,980
he was involved in the building
of the Duomo in Florence

130
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:52,100
and he's all set dealing with a flood
of new information because this is

131
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:56,280
aftermarket Marco Polos, wages
just to the east. And in fact,

132
00:08:56,281 --> 00:08:58,640
he spoke to the first
merchant aftermarket,

133
00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:03,060
hello guy called Nicholas [inaudible] and
he got stories from the sky and he was

134
00:09:03,061 --> 00:09:06,300
also trying to assimilate this
information and pull it together.

135
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,710
And he too made a map.

136
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:12,540
And when he looked at his map
and when he thought about this,

137
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:17,670
he was convinced that you could reach
east by sailing waste. And guess what?

138
00:09:17,671 --> 00:09:21,660
He sent that map to Columbus and it's
an app for the Columbus relied upon.

139
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:25,170
Now they're in orange.

140
00:09:25,171 --> 00:09:29,220
You can see what his map looks like and
behind it you can see what reality looks

141
00:09:29,221 --> 00:09:32,040
like.
And I think you can see the problem.

142
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:37,190
He thought that the ocean between Europe
and the east was about 130 degrees of

143
00:09:38,701 --> 00:09:41,730
the globe. In fact,
it's about 210 degrees.

144
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:45,300
There was a whole chunk of earth that
was missing as far as he was concerned.

145
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:48,630
And of course the rest is history.
Um,

146
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:53,510
Columbus ended up in the new world
as he thought of it as a time.

147
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:59,310
And in fact,
that's what Dustin Lee wrote.

148
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:03,300
The ocean to be crossed is not
great. Therefore, by bringing up at,

149
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:06,840
or the Asiatic coat is easily reached.
Well,

150
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:08,880
numbers make a difference.
Yeah.

151
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:14,940
So are tossed and A's around
40,000 Tuscan, alien, Columbus,

152
00:10:14,941 --> 00:10:17,970
we're working to around
30,000 or 25% difference.

153
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:24,360
Now it's easy to romanticize
this and think of the,

154
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:27,900
the ancient choirs all ancient
being the guy who got it right,

155
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:31,000
but you've got to admit there's some
dodgy numbers floating around there.

156
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:35,370
The 5,000 stadia exactly.
The one 50th of the globe.

157
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:40,110
Exactly. You know, maybe he'd got lucky,
but still he got the right answer.

158
00:10:40,111 --> 00:10:44,160
Well that, you know, and, and, and, or
something close to the right answer. So,

159
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:47,370
um,
so there's that to be said.

160
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:51,000
Now if we look at what the
actual measurements are,

161
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:53,190
we get some tune on this there,

162
00:10:53,191 --> 00:10:56,730
one around the equator of one over
the poles and a slightly different,

163
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,780
but they're both very, very close to
40,000 kilometers. And you may think,

164
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:02,070
well that's a bit dodgy.

165
00:11:02,071 --> 00:11:06,540
That's a bit close to around number and
of course that you'd be absolutely right.

166
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:09,960
And that comes from the definition of
the original definition of the meter,

167
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:15,740
which is one 10000000th of the distance
from the pole to the equator along the

168
00:11:18,061 --> 00:11:21,200
line gangs for Paris of course.
Um,

169
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:28,160
and now we start getting into numbers
that are not to do with body parts and how

170
00:11:29,131 --> 00:11:30,030
long you can walk.

171
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:34,140
You're talking about measuring the globe
and the numbering system that's derived

172
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,120
from scientific measurements.

173
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:41,400
And we start getting into what
we might call big numbers. Can,

174
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:44,220
I'm just going to take a moment now to
think about what do we mean by a big

175
00:11:44,221 --> 00:11:48,050
number? What makes a big number? You know,

176
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:52,500
40,000 kilometers around the
world. 350 million. A lot.

177
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:55,330
A number. We've heard about a
lot if you want a few years.

178
00:11:55,331 --> 00:11:59,540
But very seldom is it Austin,
is that a big number? Um,

179
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,590
seven and a half billion people in the
world, you know, is that a big number?

180
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:09,160
And I think there's a gap in our society
and our understanding and the way we

181
00:12:09,161 --> 00:12:12,370
think about numbers here. So we go
to school, we learn about numbers,

182
00:12:12,371 --> 00:12:17,290
we learn to count, we learn about bigger
numbers on that. We're going to hundreds,

183
00:12:17,291 --> 00:12:19,030
we go perhaps into thousands.

184
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:23,200
We've become very familiar with
numbers in a fairly limited range.

185
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:29,410
So I mean there's an example highest ever
single leanings test crickets call 952

186
00:12:32,141 --> 00:12:34,880
runs for six declared,
um,

187
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:37,710
India versus Sri Lanka Columbo,

188
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:42,070
1997 and I can imagine
that number building up.

189
00:12:42,071 --> 00:12:44,280
I can imagine sitting and
watching that mansion,

190
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:48,250
there'd be a six Nebia fall and there'd
be a couple of singles and slowly that

191
00:12:48,251 --> 00:12:52,750
number would accumulate. I can grasp that
process that takes me to that number,

192
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:56,290
but it's almost slipping away
from, it's almost a thing, whites,

193
00:12:56,350 --> 00:13:01,000
it's a big number in those terms.
And now you have, on the other side,

194
00:13:01,001 --> 00:13:04,090
you have these young
scientists working in the lab.

195
00:13:04,091 --> 00:13:06,670
And for them a big number may be
a very different thing entirely.

196
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:08,920
They may be thinking or
taught about regardless.

197
00:13:08,921 --> 00:13:13,921
Number in a 6.02 times 10 to
the 23 the number of mole,

198
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:17,470
the number of carbon,
12 items in 12 grams of carbon.

199
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:22,780
That's a very big number.
600 billion trillion.

200
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:25,420
And when I start saying
billions and trillions,

201
00:13:25,421 --> 00:13:29,040
they've got to be careful not to trip
over my words because this is where

202
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:30,040
confusion comes in.

203
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:34,330
And of course the scientists
use that notation,

204
00:13:34,331 --> 00:13:37,270
scientific notation and that's fine.
They learn those techniques,

205
00:13:37,271 --> 00:13:38,104
they learn those,

206
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:42,160
those algorithms for working with
those numbers and everything is fine,

207
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:44,890
but not everybody thinks in those terms.

208
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:48,040
And not all numbers I
expressed in those tournaments.

209
00:13:48,041 --> 00:13:51,280
And in between those two there is a gap.

210
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:55,600
And we talking about numbers that relate
to government now miss at relate to

211
00:13:55,601 --> 00:13:59,500
corporations and
resources and populations.

212
00:13:59,890 --> 00:14:03,400
And these numbers are beyond
the thousands. They're into
the millions, billions,

213
00:14:03,401 --> 00:14:06,100
trillions at,
you know,

214
00:14:06,101 --> 00:14:08,470
I have to watch myself
even now talking to you,

215
00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:13,570
not to say billion when I mean
million or trillion. And it's,

216
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:14,590
it's confusing.

217
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:20,190
And I don't think any of us really
grasps numbers very well in their cap.

218
00:14:20,301 --> 00:14:22,480
We've got a good,
a good understanding of small numbers.

219
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,790
We've got techniques and
dealing with very big numbers,

220
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:29,620
but that's only techniques.
It's not really a a
relationship with those numbers,

221
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:32,440
but in the middle there are some very,
some important numbers.

222
00:14:32,441 --> 00:14:35,740
They are important because we're called
upon to make decisions based upon those

223
00:14:35,741 --> 00:14:36,574
numbers.

224
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:42,700
So what I'm going to do today is rarely
try and just focus on one of those

225
00:14:42,701 --> 00:14:46,000
numbers, the global population
there, the last of those,

226
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:50,750
and just try and bring that
to life for you in in a, in a,

227
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:51,890
in a simple way.

228
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:57,050
I'm going to stop by saying how big
is a billion or we all know how big a

229
00:14:57,051 --> 00:15:00,950
billion is it to the thousand
billion since 1974 in this country,

230
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:05,450
you know, 10 to the nine one was
nine Zeros. Are they going to put it?

231
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:08,640
We'll know where to begin is,
but can be. Imagine a billion.

232
00:15:08,641 --> 00:15:12,290
Can we conceive of a billion?
We're going to get there.

233
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,280
We're going to start with how big is a
thousand I wanted to make this come to

234
00:15:16,281 --> 00:15:17,114
life for myself.

235
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:20,300
So I found out my kid at university
and I said can I play with your Lego?

236
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:26,180
And I started building a lego strip. There
you go. It's the start of it. 10 yellow,

237
00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:29,780
10 whites, 10 [inaudible], 10
white trying to build a strip,

238
00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:34,400
a thousand Lego studs
long too wide of course.

239
00:15:34,401 --> 00:15:37,910
Cause that's how it comes.
And they would guys,

240
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,520
I'm going from outside
the house into the house.

241
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:42,500
You can see my toes sticking
into the picture there.

242
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:47,550
And so I go and I build that strip and
you can see in the right in the middle of

243
00:15:47,551 --> 00:15:51,680
that I'll put a little red brick just
to mark the point. There is another,

244
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:55,550
another year of it. Now forgive me for
flooding in this, but I'm just trying to

245
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:57,990
put us in context.

246
00:15:57,991 --> 00:16:02,720
So I'm just trying to give you a
physical idea of what thousand looks like

247
00:16:02,721 --> 00:16:05,300
compared to one one in a
thousand a thousand to one ratio.

248
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:09,050
And there's the whole thing.
And then as you can see,

249
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:13,550
I've numbered that up to prove it to
myself and there's a little brick in the

250
00:16:13,551 --> 00:16:16,640
middle to show you the the one
compared to the thousands. Now

251
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:21,860
it's also the length of vendor
denial compared to the Oxford.

252
00:16:21,861 --> 00:16:26,861
Cambridge breadcrumb is 6,800
kilometers versus 6.8 kilometers.

253
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:30,260
It's also a height of Kilimanjaro
compared to pole vault record.

254
00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:33,740
It's also the height of Niagara
Falls when measured in pools.

255
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:38,090
So just trying to give you some field,
well,

256
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:44,060
you know, a thousand w w we treat,
it's unlikely we dismiss it so easily,

257
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:46,880
but it's actually quite a big number.
It's at, if you look at your screen,

258
00:16:46,881 --> 00:16:51,680
you know one in a thousand this is
maybe one or two pixels on across your

259
00:16:51,681 --> 00:16:54,440
screen. It's, it's, it's a
thousand is a big number.

260
00:16:56,210 --> 00:17:00,230
But we had to build up to a billion. Now
to build big, we need to start small.

261
00:17:00,231 --> 00:17:01,720
So even start with a tiny little ledge,

262
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:05,450
just a four millimeter antenna
and that's our starting point.

263
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:08,090
But we get an hour and he just stick
to something a little bit bigger.

264
00:17:08,690 --> 00:17:12,350
Maybe we want a beetle,
there's your beetle.

265
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:18,080
And just luckily that happens to be
about a thousand times bigger than the

266
00:17:18,081 --> 00:17:18,914
Andrea.

267
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:23,480
So I imagine a thousand ants lined
up alongside that Volkswagen beetle.

268
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:28,580
Now in another step, what's going to be
a thousand times bigger than a beetle?

269
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:31,790
Well,
it turns out in central park isn't a bad,

270
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:37,080
a bad choice just to have
a four kilometers and very
conveniently it's set in a

271
00:17:38,841 --> 00:17:43,130
place where they numbered the streets.
So the 50 street blocks there from,

272
00:17:43,970 --> 00:17:46,520
what's the time 60th to
hundred and 10th street,

273
00:17:47,810 --> 00:17:49,040
that makes 80 meters per,

274
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:55,070
and you can imagine 20 beetles on each
block of New York bumper to bumper jammed

275
00:17:56,521 --> 00:18:00,090
up all along central park west there,
the thousand cars.

276
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:04,860
And perhaps you can imagine each of those
cards has got a thousand ads next to

277
00:18:04,861 --> 00:18:09,210
them. So now you've got a
million ants going there. Okay.

278
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:13,470
So far so good. What's a thousand
times bigger than central park?

279
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,570
Turns out Australia is not a bad kid.

280
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:21,420
It's just over 4,000
code does east to West.

281
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:24,810
Your gold maps coming to my rescue there.
Um,

282
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:29,760
so that's a thousand central
park's stretching across
Australia, coast to coast.

283
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:34,950
It's a million vehicles.
Then it's a billion items.

284
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:38,580
So a building that's cross Australia,

285
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:44,840
but I can't resist going one step further
and closing the circle because if we

286
00:18:45,121 --> 00:18:48,390
know that a thousand or 4,000
kilometers is within Australia,

287
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,920
we also know that 40,000 is he a crater?

288
00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:57,210
It's a 10 billion is going to take you
align the brands all around the world

289
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:00,750
circling the earth.

290
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,233
Yeah.

291
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:07,750
A little deviation. Now how
fast can recycle. Yeah, no,

292
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:14,280
I don't know how good your
literate, uh, literacy yet.

293
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:19,210
Literature yet knowledge has, but there's
an itinerary from, uh, from her book

294
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:24,490
and we're going from the
London regarding via Hong Kong.

295
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:26,200
You're going by a San Francisco,

296
00:19:26,201 --> 00:19:30,220
we're ending up back in London and the
giveaway of course is the title there of

297
00:19:30,221 --> 00:19:31,054
80 days.

298
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:36,340
So this is a planned itinerary and Jules
van's book around the world in 80 days.

299
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:40,180
That's how I feel. Yes. Fogg plan
to get around the world. And the,

300
00:19:40,181 --> 00:19:42,980
how he calculated that he
could make it work the,

301
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:45,760
a map of the route that he took.

302
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:50,900
Okay.

303
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:55,530
And the two things that interesting
about that to me, one is that it's,

304
00:19:55,580 --> 00:20:00,110
my name is a straight line or even a
great circle. It's um, you know, he's,

305
00:20:00,111 --> 00:20:02,260
he's having to do a
fair bit of zigzagging,

306
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:06,380
especially around about southeast
danger there. Um, and secondly,

307
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:11,060
it's actually all almost entirely
in the northern hemisphere.

308
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:13,850
So the southern most
point there is Singapore,

309
00:20:13,970 --> 00:20:18,520
which is pretty much on the equator.
Um, so for two reasons, well, there's,

310
00:20:18,521 --> 00:20:19,900
there's two contracting forces here.

311
00:20:19,901 --> 00:20:24,901
One is going longer than 40,000 because
he's going the zigzags and he's getting

312
00:20:26,451 --> 00:20:30,590
shorter because he's actually going
in the northern part of the earth.

313
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:34,610
So again,
Google maps came to my rescue.

314
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:39,740
I measured those sort of point to point
distances on some key points there.

315
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:43,900
And actually it comes out not far off,
38,000 kilometers.

316
00:20:43,901 --> 00:20:45,860
So I reckon that was all right.

317
00:20:46,670 --> 00:20:49,780
So he do around the world in 80 days,

318
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:55,270
steam and rail was his, what was
driving him there. Now, Eric tossing,

319
00:20:55,271 --> 00:20:59,950
these would have known that you could
walk around the world with about a

320
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:03,730
thousand days if you had
a right, of course. Um, we
can drive a bit faster than,

321
00:21:03,731 --> 00:21:08,100
than that. Last year a
fellow called funds for, uh,

322
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:10,930
um, a copy of the thing. I'm not

323
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:16,290
afraid to say that and did
a trip around the world. Um,

324
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:17,680
Gabba Francoise Gaba,

325
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:21,280
I did a trip around the world and
they'll try Moran took him 43 days to go

326
00:21:21,281 --> 00:21:24,610
around the world solo.
We commercial flights,

327
00:21:25,090 --> 00:21:27,400
you can do it in two and a half days.
And I checked up on this,

328
00:21:27,401 --> 00:21:30,400
you can take any New Zealand
from London to Oakland,

329
00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:35,850
Los Angeles in two and a half
hours on the ground and in Oakland.

330
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:39,880
And you can take a BA flight back via
Sydney and Singapore and it takes you

331
00:21:39,881 --> 00:21:42,490
exactly 60 hours,
two and a half days.

332
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:45,880
A plane has actually a B 52.

333
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:49,930
Obama has actually flown around the
world in 42 hours refilling on flight.

334
00:21:50,650 --> 00:21:54,880
I'm the fastest play in the
plan is a blackbird re complain.

335
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:57,150
It didn't actually go around the world.
It's,

336
00:21:57,250 --> 00:22:00,730
it did a 24,000 kilometer journey,

337
00:22:00,731 --> 00:22:03,250
60% of the way in about
10 and a half hours.

338
00:22:03,251 --> 00:22:07,330
So that would have been equivalent to
going around in 17 and a half hours and

339
00:22:07,331 --> 00:22:10,420
the International Space Station of
course goes around about every hour and a

340
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:12,730
half,
so about 15 times a day.

341
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:17,140
But then I came across one more
measurement that I couldn't leave out,

342
00:22:18,010 --> 00:22:22,180
which was from Shakespeare and he said
that he has puck saying midsummer night's

343
00:22:22,181 --> 00:22:22,840
dream.

344
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:27,280
I will put a girdle round about the earth
in 40 minutes and when I saw that 40

345
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:33,060
it chimed with my 40,000 so there's
a thousand kilometers admitted,

346
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:36,430
one mega Meta permitted.

347
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:41,460
I think we should have a new unit of
speed called a pack once mega liter per

348
00:22:41,951 --> 00:22:45,980
minute. Anyway, that's a
bit of diversion. Yeah.

349
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:50,710
Let's talk about the number of people
that th th th the seven and a half billion

350
00:22:50,711 --> 00:22:52,990
people now you guys,

351
00:22:52,991 --> 00:22:56,440
I'm sure it will know all about
this guy called Hans Rosling died.

352
00:22:56,441 --> 00:23:00,090
Sandy last year.
Swedish doctors,

353
00:23:00,091 --> 00:23:04,840
statistician talk, her
thinker, Wonderful Fella.

354
00:23:04,841 --> 00:23:09,841
If you've not seen his videos or read
his book fact for this God and get it,

355
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:14,240
it's it's, it's a fantastic,
fantastic book. And He,

356
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:16,690
this is him talking about
the world's population.

357
00:23:17,170 --> 00:23:21,640
And in the first picture there he showing
7 billion people as he had at the time

358
00:23:22,210 --> 00:23:24,070
and the age distribution of these people.

359
00:23:24,071 --> 00:23:27,790
So you've got 2 billion people under
the age of 15 2 billion children,

360
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:32,620
2 billion in the next traunch up to the
age of 30 and then a billion, a billion,

361
00:23:32,621 --> 00:23:37,621
a billion going up to 75 and he's talking
about the wine which population grows

362
00:23:38,591 --> 00:23:40,090
and the way in which
it's a predictable thing.

363
00:23:40,690 --> 00:23:44,170
And he says what's happening now is
that the number of children is not

364
00:23:44,171 --> 00:23:45,950
significantly increasing in the world.

365
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:49,940
What's happening is that people are
getting older and so those columns are

366
00:23:49,941 --> 00:23:53,180
growing upwards but the whole
structure is not getting wider.

367
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:58,280
So he's taking it there from
seven to 10 billion by aging.

368
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:01,790
Those pop, those, those,
those, those young people.

369
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:05,180
And that is a change of pricing in the
world and how it is the way that the

370
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:06,590
population is progressing

371
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:11,600
and it takes a little bit
further and he says, yes,

372
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:15,390
people are going to be living longer
and he's putting another block on top of

373
00:24:15,391 --> 00:24:17,880
there to make it into 11 billion.
Um,

374
00:24:17,930 --> 00:24:20,450
and that would cover the age 75 to 90.

375
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:24,230
This is obviously a very crude and simple
terms but nonetheless it helps you to

376
00:24:24,231 --> 00:24:27,660
focus the mind. It helps you to
think about these numbers. Um, in,

377
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:30,350
in the background there he's got a
little chart based on the United Nations

378
00:24:30,351 --> 00:24:34,040
projection and he talks about
having reached peak child.

379
00:24:34,730 --> 00:24:35,563
In other words,

380
00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:40,370
for several decades now the number
of children in the world hasn't been

381
00:24:40,371 --> 00:24:43,700
increasing. What's happening is
that adults are getting older,

382
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:46,070
more people are living to old age.

383
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:53,230
And I mean there's a whole discussion to
be had and the whole discussion around

384
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:56,780
all of the implications of this I which
one to pick out one thing here and that

385
00:24:56,781 --> 00:24:59,870
is around 2050 around the
middle of the century,

386
00:25:00,130 --> 00:25:04,970
we are going to pass the a number
of 10 billion people in the world.

387
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Whether we go beyond that, whether
it be for, you know, when we uh,

388
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:14,400
whether it tops out.
We're not talking about that yet.

389
00:25:14,401 --> 00:25:19,100
Now just a question of at some point we
will hit 10 billion and what will that

390
00:25:19,101 --> 00:25:19,934
look like?

391
00:25:23,570 --> 00:25:25,340
Now we've already got a
reference point for this.

392
00:25:25,341 --> 00:25:29,120
We've already covered this because we
know what 10 billion ads look like.

393
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:32,480
It's a 10 billion ants wind
their way around the world ones.

394
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:37,940
Now I need a bit more space than an ENT.
If an ant gets four millimeters,

395
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,650
maybe I need a meter.

396
00:25:40,430 --> 00:25:45,430
So Ryan of people would then be 250
times as long with wind around the earth.

397
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:48,950
250 times.
Can we visualize that?

398
00:25:50,030 --> 00:25:51,470
Let's take some central parks.

399
00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:56,030
If we put 10,000 central
parks around the world,

400
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:58,730
central park is 850 meters across.

401
00:25:58,731 --> 00:26:03,470
It's enough space for 250 lines of people
and three meters between them and that

402
00:26:03,471 --> 00:26:05,900
would be 1 billion people
sitting in each park.

403
00:26:05,901 --> 00:26:09,290
So 1 billion people in 10,000
parks around the world.

404
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:14,350
Is that realistic? Well,
yes. I'm showing my age here,

405
00:26:14,510 --> 00:26:19,460
but in 1981 silo and Garfunkel
reunion concert concert,

406
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:24,260
they pulled 500,000 people onto the
great lawn in central park and that had

407
00:26:24,261 --> 00:26:25,910
bigger crowds in that instance then.

408
00:26:26,510 --> 00:26:30,590
So there we are pushing towards
a million people in central park.

409
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:36,020
Is that realistic? Yes, it is. To think
about that. How do I numbers agree?

410
00:26:36,021 --> 00:26:40,460
Yes, I do. Just a little few
validity checks and we can be,

411
00:26:40,461 --> 00:26:43,590
we were happy that we were in
the right order of magnitude cal.

412
00:26:45,930 --> 00:26:47,070
How dense are those people?

413
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:51,030
It works out to about 300,000 per square
kilometers and that's the direction.

414
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:54,960
Now obviously we're not trying to say
that all the people in the world can

415
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:59,520
convert at that density,
but how densely can people live?

416
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:05,010
Well, the place on earth with the
greatest population density is Macau.

417
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:10,880
I'm sort of the sister said you to Hong
Kong on the China Sea there and they've

418
00:27:10,981 --> 00:27:13,200
got 21,000 people per square kilometer.

419
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:17,580
That's only 15 times as much as
those profilers in central park had.

420
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:19,800
Um,
so it's pretty dense,

421
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:24,840
but you can see there is some um,

422
00:27:24,870 --> 00:27:29,250
green space.
There is a working city of a viable city.

423
00:27:29,251 --> 00:27:30,720
It is a viable way of living.

424
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:34,440
So let's just do a thought experiment
here and say what happened?

425
00:27:34,890 --> 00:27:37,800
What if all the world loves a
densely as they did in the cow,

426
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:41,370
how much space would that need?
Well,

427
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:45,390
480,000 kilometers squared squared.

428
00:27:46,590 --> 00:27:50,970
Now you can see what I've done. There are
factories that into my favorite number,

429
00:27:50,971 --> 00:27:52,650
40,000 by 12.

430
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:58,460
So you can imagine that as being a
ribbon said he stretched around the world

431
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,590
only 12 kilometers wide.

432
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:07,410
So think about this remote,
even from the center of that,

433
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:10,730
you could walk six kilometers,
what's it,

434
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:13,950
two hours walk and you'd get
to the edge of this, the city.

435
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:18,600
And there would be nothing between you
and the Paul. Of course, there'd be farms,

436
00:28:18,601 --> 00:28:22,440
it'd be everything that we need to, to
sustain ourselves. But in terms of people,

437
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:26,100
we could put everybody in the world
into 12 kilometer wide strip around the

438
00:28:26,101 --> 00:28:26,690
world.

439
00:28:26,690 --> 00:28:31,690
But of course we don't want to live at
that level of density that they live in

440
00:28:32,290 --> 00:28:37,020
Macao. Um, you know what,
for good or for bad,

441
00:28:37,021 --> 00:28:39,380
we've chosen to live in, in England, um,

442
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:44,130
with the density is about
420 per square kilometers.

443
00:28:44,130 --> 00:28:48,090
So that's about 50 times as much
space as the inhabitance of MCI.

444
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:53,580
And those 10 million people would need
around 24 million square kilometers.

445
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:58,650
And again,
factorized that 40,000 by 600.

446
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:02,190
And so we get there,
say a belt nation there.

447
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:06,480
So a country,
it's about the same

448
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:11,490
north to south as the length of England.
It's about the same as Ecuador,

449
00:29:11,491 --> 00:29:15,060
which is on the equator. Uh,
and again, it's, you know,

450
00:29:15,061 --> 00:29:19,170
that would have space for the lake
districts and the national parks and the

451
00:29:19,171 --> 00:29:24,171
cities and the suburbia and
no more than 300 kilometers,

452
00:29:25,711 --> 00:29:28,950
half a day's drive to get to the edge
and nothing between you and the poem.

453
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:35,490
Now, I'm not going to suggest
this is a practical plan,

454
00:29:36,770 --> 00:29:40,100
but it's just to get these ideas in
your head of how much space it takes up.

455
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:43,090
Here's another way of
expressing it is 80% of Africa,

456
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:47,050
everybody in the world could live in that
living at the density that we live in

457
00:29:47,051 --> 00:29:51,430
England. Of course I'm
oversimplifying like crazy. Yeah.

458
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:56,620
Um, and you know, 10 billion people.

459
00:29:56,621 --> 00:30:01,380
Is that a big number? But
of course it is. It does.

460
00:30:01,390 --> 00:30:04,900
The world of space for 10 billion
people. Well, of course it does.

461
00:30:05,410 --> 00:30:09,430
But that's not that simple.
You know, we've, we've,

462
00:30:09,431 --> 00:30:11,170
we've not talked about
distribution of people.

463
00:30:11,171 --> 00:30:13,960
How are we not talked about the food
that they need, the water they need,

464
00:30:13,990 --> 00:30:14,890
the waste they produce,

465
00:30:16,570 --> 00:30:21,570
the what is needed to give those 10
billion people meaningful and fulfilling

466
00:30:22,691 --> 00:30:25,540
lives.
And

467
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:30,170
Rarely, I'm not sure to
tell you that's, you know,

468
00:30:30,190 --> 00:30:34,150
10 billion people is not a problem. Of
course it is. There are massive problems,

469
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:39,880
but until he start measuring
the problems they become,

470
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:43,750
they are very hard to deal with unless
you can actually start putting numbers to

471
00:30:43,751 --> 00:30:44,950
some of those ideas.

472
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:50,290
You don't have a chance of actually
dealing with any of the issues.

473
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:55,240
And all I could quote from Isaac Asimov,

474
00:30:55,241 --> 00:30:58,510
great science fiction writer,
if knowledge can create problems,

475
00:30:58,511 --> 00:31:00,730
it's not through ignorance.
So if we can solve them,

476
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:06,280
so what solutions they come,
we will, they come from,

477
00:31:06,470 --> 00:31:09,160
we talk about the 10 billion people
when we think in terms of problem,

478
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:14,740
but 10 billion people is also 10 billion
minds to think of solutions. It's also

479
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:21,010
10 billion people with inspiration,
with determination, with drive.

480
00:31:21,790 --> 00:31:25,990
And it's people like you who were,

481
00:31:25,991 --> 00:31:28,480
those solutions will come from it.
Smart people,

482
00:31:28,870 --> 00:31:33,180
it's people who are practical,
are problem solvers.

483
00:31:33,181 --> 00:31:37,990
As people who
think it comes down to it.

484
00:31:38,090 --> 00:31:39,240
For people who are numerate,

485
00:31:39,850 --> 00:31:43,270
those are the people who are going to get
to grips with the issues and deal with

486
00:31:43,271 --> 00:31:45,400
them.
And,

487
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:52,343
yeah,

488
00:31:54,450 --> 00:31:55,770
and it's not just the techies.

489
00:31:55,771 --> 00:31:59,670
It's not just guys like you who can
grasp the problems and deal with them.

490
00:32:00,930 --> 00:32:04,500
But there needs to be a political will
and the people with political power and

491
00:32:04,501 --> 00:32:05,370
people with political,

492
00:32:05,510 --> 00:32:09,240
with financial power also need to be
on board to make these things happen.

493
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:12,780
And they need to be persuaded
and they need people to spend it.

494
00:32:12,781 --> 00:32:15,990
Sometimes not through big data,
but sometimes through little data,

495
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:19,920
sometimes three little points that they
can focus on that they can latch on to,

496
00:32:19,921 --> 00:32:24,090
that they can invest in their minds.
And it says this communication aspect,

497
00:32:24,091 --> 00:32:27,300
I think that is very
important. Um, you know,

498
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:28,920
the reporters and the
journalists of the world,

499
00:32:28,921 --> 00:32:30,900
they'll to sensationalize
sensationalizing sometimes.

500
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:36,240
And it's a question of trying to ground
these and trying to bring these issues

501
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:39,650
to a measurable levels where
we can think about them.

502
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:43,520
And sometimes it's complex
and sometimes it's simple.

503
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:47,870
Sometimes it's as simple as asking
the question, is that a big number?

504
00:32:49,430 --> 00:32:54,430
And rarely that simple question is
what's behind what's in the book.

505
00:32:55,070 --> 00:32:58,670
Um, I talk about various ways of
getting numbers in perspective.

506
00:32:58,700 --> 00:32:59,990
How do you compare numbers,

507
00:33:00,410 --> 00:33:03,290
ways of thinking about them as there's
lots of sort of visualization and there

508
00:33:03,291 --> 00:33:05,750
the stories about numbers.
Um,

509
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:10,610
and it's a question of getting our brains
around and being able to express as

510
00:33:10,611 --> 00:33:15,120
numbers in ways that are meaningful
and those that are useful to, to uh,

511
00:33:15,150 --> 00:33:19,580
to people. Um, and yeah,

512
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:24,830
so let me up. That's the book. Um, there's
a website, is that a big number.com?

513
00:33:24,950 --> 00:33:28,640
I'm Andrew [inaudible]. I'm also,
I've got a Twitter feed there.

514
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:33,890
Um, those of you who have picked up a
copy of the book, I hope you enjoy it.

515
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:37,790
Um, and if anybody got any
questions, I'm happy to answer.

516
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:50,670
You say it's important to get a grip of
numbers and understand and put them into

517
00:33:50,671 --> 00:33:53,850
relation, uh, big numbers especially. Um,

518
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:58,470
how do you suggest we help people do that?

519
00:33:58,950 --> 00:34:01,290
Um,
because lots of people,

520
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:06,610
probably all of us struggle with very big
numbers and putting them in relations.

521
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:09,830
I mean, I've talked through in the
book various techniques. The top one,

522
00:34:09,831 --> 00:34:13,220
the landmark numbers is one
that I think is very important.

523
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:15,920
What I mean by landmark number,
it's something that you,

524
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:19,220
that sticks in your brain,
you don't set out to memorize it,

525
00:34:19,221 --> 00:34:21,320
but it sticks in your
brain as a reference point.

526
00:34:21,770 --> 00:34:26,770
And I hope that all of you will leave
knowing that 40,000 kilometers is the

527
00:34:27,441 --> 00:34:31,220
length of the crater. Um, and that
can be a reference number. So you can,

528
00:34:31,250 --> 00:34:34,070
when you see that you buy, um, you know,

529
00:34:35,090 --> 00:34:38,360
Australia is one 10th of that African
north to south is one fifth of that.

530
00:34:39,170 --> 00:34:41,390
It becomes something that's
in your head that you,

531
00:34:41,410 --> 00:34:46,190
is it a ready reference for you to
come through to, to, to relate to.

532
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:50,720
And the seven and a half billion people
in the world and they're, you know,

533
00:34:50,990 --> 00:34:54,770
these are numbers which if
you have them ready to hand,

534
00:34:55,070 --> 00:34:57,890
they help you to make these yardstick
comparisons against things that you hear

535
00:34:57,891 --> 00:35:01,220
about. And it may be budgets,
it may be populations.

536
00:35:01,610 --> 00:35:03,920
It's stuff that when you hear something
on the new juice, you're saying,

537
00:35:04,010 --> 00:35:04,843
hold on a minute.

538
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:08,450
That's not a big number because it
compares with that number in this way.

539
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:11,630
And that's, that's, that's
one of the techniques. Yeah.

540
00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:19,083
Um,

541
00:35:19,210 --> 00:35:23,530
you were saying that on your website
you have like a database of numbers you

542
00:35:23,531 --> 00:35:27,100
compare it to. Yeah. Can you
tell us what some of them are?

543
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:31,000
I assume one is the 40,000.
Yeah. That's where I come from.

544
00:35:31,001 --> 00:35:32,650
All sorts of things really.
I mean it's,

545
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:37,150
what I tried to do is to find numbers
that would make meaningful comparisons.

546
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:42,200
So some of them are just
sort of re routine households
or everyday objects like

547
00:35:44,071 --> 00:35:48,590
the size of a post it note. Some of
them are things like, um, you know,

548
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:51,450
landmarks, the height of the empire
state building or the height of

549
00:35:53,550 --> 00:35:58,380
the height of the Eiffel Tower with the
ACA. And one of the things that I, I,

550
00:35:58,410 --> 00:36:02,610
that is on the website and in the book
is I try and find passive that is not,

551
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:06,150
is that comparing an interesting way?
So for example,

552
00:36:06,690 --> 00:36:11,340
the empire state building is 5,000 posted
notes. Hi. You know, almost exactly.

553
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:16,830
I do the comparison to [inaudible]. Um,
and you get some really interesting,

554
00:36:17,010 --> 00:36:19,240
interesting numbers that
come through and that has a,

555
00:36:19,770 --> 00:36:23,820
it's an interesting function because
it makes you think about the numbers

556
00:36:23,821 --> 00:36:25,950
themselves, but it's almost
like a triangle. You know,

557
00:36:25,951 --> 00:36:29,460
he has the empire state building, he has
a posted note and he has a number 5,000,

558
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:33,360
and it gives you a little bit of a feel
for each of those points of the triangle.

559
00:36:33,361 --> 00:36:36,100
When you think about them in that
relationship. Of course it, it,

560
00:36:36,570 --> 00:36:38,670
it means nothing in terms of if,
you know,

561
00:36:39,310 --> 00:36:43,200
there's no conspiracy theory here that
they designed it to fit the posted note.

562
00:36:43,710 --> 00:36:44,710
Um,
but it's,

563
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:49,050
it's still studying at sticks in the mind
and that's an interesting way of going

564
00:36:49,051 --> 00:36:53,430
about it. But yes, at the numbers, the
numbers on the website, off our things,

565
00:36:53,431 --> 00:36:57,780
like at the length of the light Nile
river, you know, the population of Brazil,

566
00:36:58,770 --> 00:37:03,390
there are numbers that you can
compare things to. Um, um, and,

567
00:37:03,391 --> 00:37:07,750
and that, that's something that may or
may not be intriguing when you bring,

568
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:08,700
when you see them.

569
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:11,350
Thanks for the talk in the book.

570
00:37:11,410 --> 00:37:14,980
So it seems that most of the things
you've talked about, at least so far,

571
00:37:14,981 --> 00:37:16,270
I don't live in the book,
there's more,

572
00:37:16,271 --> 00:37:19,600
but it's like about physical quantities
that you can kind of compare it,

573
00:37:19,630 --> 00:37:22,540
like look at one versus the other.
What do you think,

574
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:25,990
do you think that the same strategies
apply to think things that are more in

575
00:37:25,991 --> 00:37:29,770
material, like information and so
on. Like maybe a few years ago,

576
00:37:29,771 --> 00:37:32,870
like thinking in megabytes would have
been fine. Now we're talking gigabytes.

577
00:37:33,790 --> 00:37:38,640
So maybe it's a different, like
it's almost like unbounded,
uh, in a way, like the,

578
00:37:38,641 --> 00:37:42,730
the kind of a amount of numbers, the size
of the numbers that these things are.

579
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:43,793
So you think,

580
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:48,060
so the first book is a book is it's more
physical things around us, you know,

581
00:37:48,330 --> 00:37:50,490
it's white and it's Spanish,
isn't it? Things like that.

582
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:53,220
Second off of the book first gets
into certain numbers from science.

583
00:37:53,221 --> 00:37:57,570
So we'd talk about how you can
visualize or start to grasp,

584
00:37:57,750 --> 00:38:01,440
for example, the size of the observable
universe. You know, get there by stages,

585
00:38:01,441 --> 00:38:02,770
you know,
um,

586
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:07,570
and there's a chapter on inflammation
and regarding going to things like, um,

587
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:10,020
how do you measure information,
that's all, you know,

588
00:38:10,350 --> 00:38:12,190
how to information is contained in texts,

589
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:15,690
how information is stored in physical
devices and things like that.

590
00:38:15,691 --> 00:38:18,780
Of course that part of the book is
out of date before it's published,

591
00:38:20,550 --> 00:38:23,850
but nonetheless principles remain.
Um,

592
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:27,040
and then there's a chapter on
mathematical numbers as well. Um,

593
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:30,710
it's really not a book about mass,
but we have to touch on things like um,

594
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:31,110
you know,

595
00:38:31,110 --> 00:38:36,010
explained that that infinity is not
actually a number on the number line or

596
00:38:36,011 --> 00:38:38,320
you're talking about grams number,
which is an interesting,

597
00:38:38,321 --> 00:38:42,610
he made a few grams number.
Yeah. I mean it's, it's, it's a,

598
00:38:42,611 --> 00:38:44,190
it's a non both.
Um,

599
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:47,710
I first came across it when it was in
the Guinness Book of Records as the

600
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:52,810
largest number ever used in a
serious mathematical context I guess.

601
00:38:52,811 --> 00:38:56,980
And Grimes number is just a recipe
for taking pallets of numbers and

602
00:38:56,981 --> 00:39:01,330
unbelievably large number of times you
could not write down Graham's number,

603
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:06,100
the world, the universe would
not have space for it. Um,
so question is, you know,

604
00:39:06,101 --> 00:39:10,510
is it even a number if it's all that
it is, is a, an algorithm for, for,

605
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:14,580
for doing computation red you
could never carry out. Um,

606
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:18,560
but actually even if I,
you know,

607
00:39:18,570 --> 00:39:23,230
going buy a coffee and it cost me two
pounds 50, that number two pounds 50,

608
00:39:23,410 --> 00:39:26,620
it's just an algorithm.
It's not the number itself.

609
00:39:26,650 --> 00:39:30,140
There are some digits there and we are
heads of the algorithm for turning that

610
00:39:30,150 --> 00:39:34,720
into a number. So there's no point of
principle difference between the two.

611
00:39:35,030 --> 00:39:35,930
Thank you for the talk.

612
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:40,700
I have a question
because I mean my family,

613
00:39:40,701 --> 00:39:44,540
like half of the kids don't
understand math. You know,

614
00:39:44,630 --> 00:39:47,610
I was fortunate to understand it a bit,
but um,

615
00:39:47,630 --> 00:39:51,080
do you think this like
understanding numbers should be,

616
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:55,510
have a bigger role in school because how
math is taught in Germany for instance?

617
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:58,540
Still Very, you know, basic. Yeah.

618
00:39:58,790 --> 00:40:02,300
And very on the numbers rather
than on what the numbers mean.

619
00:40:02,430 --> 00:40:04,380
I think there's an interesting
thing job cause I think,

620
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:09,150
I think math is a thing of beauty.
Math is math is a,

621
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:14,240
is an abstract thinking skill
of all subtlety and profanity.

622
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:17,250
Um,
and what we call

623
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:22,470
what I called numeracy.
Of course it touches on maths,

624
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,960
but it is not math.
It's dealing with numbers.

625
00:40:24,961 --> 00:40:28,350
It's the way in which those abstractions
of maths connect to the real world.

626
00:40:28,580 --> 00:40:32,760
Yeah. And I think, I mean I'm no
teacher, I'm an educational expert.

627
00:40:32,761 --> 00:40:34,440
I can't speak with
authority on those matters.

628
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:39,740
But it seems to me that we leave behind
numbers due to live on two maths.

629
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:46,560
And I think that some of the things
I've been looking at Yarra suggest to me

630
00:40:46,561 --> 00:40:51,150
that there's much more that we can do
in terms of what I would call adult

631
00:40:51,151 --> 00:40:51,984
numeracy,

632
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:57,000
advanced numeracy to actually think about
numbers into the millions and billions

633
00:40:57,001 --> 00:41:00,480
and trillions.
And

634
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:03,960
there's a shift that happens.
I mean we all,

635
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:09,260
when we start thinking and at junior
school we're thinking in terms of linear

636
00:41:09,690 --> 00:41:13,140
numbers, linear scales. But truthfully,

637
00:41:13,141 --> 00:41:16,860
the interesting stuff happens when you
start looking at more like logarithmic

638
00:41:16,861 --> 00:41:21,000
scales. When you start thinking of things
in terms of, of multiples of each other.

639
00:41:21,430 --> 00:41:26,040
Um, and when you, the way to understand
things like the size of the university,

640
00:41:26,041 --> 00:41:28,260
you can't do it if you're thinking
in terms of a linear scar.

641
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:32,940
You've got to think in terms of what is
of magnitude in terms of powers and so

642
00:41:32,941 --> 00:41:36,770
on. I think there's that sort
of numerous thinking. I don't,

643
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:39,320
I'm not aware that that's
part of the scope of our,

644
00:41:39,321 --> 00:41:43,070
of school mathematics and I think it's
actually very important and it's very

645
00:41:43,071 --> 00:41:45,740
useful to think in terms of, of, of,

646
00:41:46,010 --> 00:41:50,660
of proportions rather than linear scales.
Thank you again.

647
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:55,010
Thank you all for your attention.
