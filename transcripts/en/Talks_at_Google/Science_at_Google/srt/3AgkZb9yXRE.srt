1
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:09,230
[inaudible].

2
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:13,820
I hooks, my name is Steve Jobs are, and
this is my colleague Franz Pretorius.

3
00:00:13,821 --> 00:00:16,910
We are the authors of the
little book of black holes,

4
00:00:16,911 --> 00:00:21,911
which is really hot off the process
and there's some copies over there.

5
00:00:22,401 --> 00:00:26,260
I hope there's a few left and we'll
be sticking around to assign a,

6
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:30,080
if you want to, um, a
version of that sign. Um,

7
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:35,380
so our book is about black holes and
about Einstein's theories of special and

8
00:00:36,081 --> 00:00:36,980
general relativity.

9
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:42,490
And what I wanted to do to start is to
talk about how time behaves in special

10
00:00:43,731 --> 00:00:47,450
relativity because when we get to
general relativity and black holes,

11
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:52,470
it'll help us a lot to a warmed up with
on the way special relativity works.

12
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:56,120
So,
so let's just do a first demo,

13
00:00:56,121 --> 00:01:00,040
which I have to admit as a
bit of a fake, um, these, uh,

14
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:02,550
stop watching as if they
were accurate to a femto.

15
00:01:02,551 --> 00:01:04,960
Second will be just right
for this Devin download, but,

16
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:08,510
but somehow I couldn't get hold of
the, the more accurate ones. Anyway,

17
00:01:08,511 --> 00:01:09,950
so we're going to do the twin paradox.

18
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:14,630
I this normally understood I ain't going
to run across the room and come back.

19
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:18,650
Well France stay still and we're going
to each one of our stopwatch starting on

20
00:01:18,651 --> 00:01:23,510
three, one, two, three, like this.

21
00:01:23,690 --> 00:01:28,520
That's what constant velocity,
more or less book shit.

22
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:34,700
Uh, I have seven seconds, six seconds

23
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:42,080
time dilation.
I managed to have less time.

24
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:42,943
Alas,

25
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:48,040
I say just kidding because the actual
difference between our times was

26
00:01:48,171 --> 00:01:49,970
approximately one,
femto second.

27
00:01:49,971 --> 00:01:54,530
I'm actually now younger than
frons by about a femtosecond.

28
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:57,320
And so we commute into New York City.

29
00:01:57,530 --> 00:02:02,530
We actually gain a little bit more youth
or if you maintain a regimen of jogging

30
00:02:03,951 --> 00:02:07,950
every day, it does actually
keep you slightly younger. Uh,

31
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:13,090
so let's just see this same thing.
I'm in an animation I've got, um,

32
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:17,330
now, uh, me, I suppose running the other
way across the stage. Go for it. Go for,

33
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:22,970
um, holding a stopwatch, and then
I accelerated to run backward.

34
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:27,290
Meanwhile, I've got frons with
a fictitious Fred Fred here. Um,

35
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:30,890
and I suppose that I go
for a full 60 seconds,

36
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:33,540
but you can see here I've, I've, um,

37
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:38,950
arrange things so that I'm moving really
fast, which I can in the demo, I'm,

38
00:02:38,951 --> 00:02:41,420
I'm, I'm moving at a significant
fraction of the speed of light.

39
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:45,770
And so my clock really does run
significantly slower. You can really,

40
00:02:45,771 --> 00:02:50,771
you can really see it now on the first
thing that people tend to say when they

41
00:02:53,271 --> 00:02:56,630
see the twin paradox is if,

42
00:02:56,810 --> 00:03:00,460
if motion is really relative
the way Einstein taught us,

43
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:05,560
why can't we look at it another
way? Let's go to the next, um,

44
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:10,840
the next animation. Why can't we
look at it this way? Go ahead.

45
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:17,640
Where I consider myself to be stationary
and I consider France to the one who

46
00:03:19,521 --> 00:03:22,450
was moving back and forth,
why can't we look at it that way?

47
00:03:22,451 --> 00:03:26,560
If motion is relative and the
answer is yes, motion is relative,

48
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:30,940
but acceleration is something real.
Because when I got to the end of the room,

49
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:35,680
I had to actually work at it to turn
around and come back while as while I'm

50
00:03:35,681 --> 00:03:37,630
actually moving at a constant velocity.
Okay.

51
00:03:37,631 --> 00:03:42,540
If I were like frictionless or something
like that, I could just coast. Um, and,

52
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:46,840
and my, my motion would be than
physically equivalent to standing still.

53
00:03:46,841 --> 00:03:51,160
So it's really the acceleration
which distinguishes between me,

54
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,780
the,
the guy who's clocked run slow and,

55
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:57,940
and frauds who's clock runs
at the normal time. This,

56
00:03:57,941 --> 00:04:02,770
this is wall time, namely the time
that some distant observer would, uh,

57
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:06,250
would, would, would perceive, okay. So,

58
00:04:06,251 --> 00:04:11,251
so let's understand a little bit more of
the physics of why time has to do this.

59
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:17,650
And the claim is that if you,
if you think about it just right,

60
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:23,220
you can not only see that time must run
slower for the accelerating observer,

61
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:28,300
you can even derive one of the main
formulas or special relativity. So let's,

62
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:30,930
let's now think about this,

63
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:35,960
this particular demo or animation
where instead of an ordinary stopwatch,

64
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:42,010
fronds and I are going to carry little
photon clocks and we measure the way time

65
00:04:42,011 --> 00:04:46,930
passes according to how many times the
photon goes up and down and up and down.

66
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:51,130
And so for the moment I've got a stopwatch
also so that you can compare it and

67
00:04:51,131 --> 00:04:54,790
see that these are two equivalent
ways of measuring time.

68
00:04:54,791 --> 00:04:57,700
Only the stopwatch, you
know, this, this stopwatch,

69
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,460
who knows how that works in
might have gears or something.

70
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:04,780
The way this photon would clock works
is actually closely related to the way

71
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,490
atomic clocks work.
So it,

72
00:05:06,491 --> 00:05:11,491
so it really is sort of physically
transparent and so far we're not having me

73
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:13,840
orphans move at all.

74
00:05:13,841 --> 00:05:18,400
But now let's see indeed what happens if
I do my little dance of running across

75
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:22,270
the stage with my photon clock.
Uh,

76
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:26,950
and the claim is that my photon clock
does get out of sync with bronzes.

77
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:30,940
As you saw, the photon is
going up and down more slowly.

78
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:34,060
What's transparent about that?
Well,

79
00:05:34,061 --> 00:05:38,230
let's look at two more animations
that I hope it will become clear.

80
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,370
I'm now going to trace the
path of the photon as it goes.

81
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:46,870
And once you can notice,
if you sort of look closely,

82
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:51,850
is that the overall
velocity of the Photon,

83
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:54,640
the overall speed is actually constant.

84
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:57,860
It changes its direction of
lost the changes direction.

85
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:03,230
And goes across and back and so forth,
but it's, it's speed is constant.

86
00:06:03,231 --> 00:06:07,460
It's always a speed of light,
and as the same speed that fronds is,

87
00:06:07,461 --> 00:06:09,770
photon experience was going up and down,

88
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:13,550
but Rhonda Proton makes it up and down
more times because all it's doing is

89
00:06:13,551 --> 00:06:18,170
going up and down, whereas my photon
has to do the left right motion too.

90
00:06:18,171 --> 00:06:20,450
And so that keeps it from going
up and down. It's been at times.

91
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:25,850
The point is that
encapsulates time dilation,

92
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:30,560
because time is nothing more than how
many times the photon goes up and down.

93
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:32,180
Nothing more or less.

94
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:37,550
So if we buy into that and we
bind to that picture, like I said,

95
00:06:37,551 --> 00:06:41,180
we can actually derive one of the
main equations of special relativity.

96
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:42,710
Let's see it in the demo.

97
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:46,700
Now I'm just going to move across stage in

98
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,090
a, oops, we've got a little, sorry,

99
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:54,140
I forgot to reset my phone.

100
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:58,160
This is the sin of using global
variables when you should use local

101
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:04,910
because the path, is it a global
variable? Okay, nevermind.

102
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:11,000
I'm a physicist, not a computer
scientist, so I write sloppy code. Anyway.

103
00:07:11,001 --> 00:07:15,230
Here's the photon. Doing what an odd to
do, following me going across the stage.

104
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:20,660
And I decided to have a similar
trajectory where I do not accelerate.

105
00:07:20,661 --> 00:07:25,310
I just run in cost, block the across
the stage on. And as a result,

106
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,420
the photons trajectory,

107
00:07:26,421 --> 00:07:31,310
my photons from directory is straight
and it follows the hypotenuse of a right

108
00:07:31,311 --> 00:07:32,090
triangle.

109
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:37,090
It has a right word component where it's
going in and out of Velocity v which is

110
00:07:37,281 --> 00:07:39,260
my velocity when any cross the stage,

111
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:41,180
obviously somewhat less
than the speed of light.

112
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:44,630
Although in this illustration I made it
actually nearly this because I'm like,

113
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:50,180
uh, and then, and then there's a downward
component of the photons motions,

114
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:55,840
which I defined to be c times that
time tau that I perceive as a lapsing.

115
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:01,880
This is the crucial point
that I define my time,

116
00:08:01,881 --> 00:08:06,881
my proper time in terms of
how much distance the photon
managers to track in my

117
00:08:07,551 --> 00:08:08,990
own friend.
Uh,

118
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:14,210
and that's why this side of the right
triangle is the speed of light times tau

119
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:16,120
on and,

120
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:20,150
and now we get to the point where we can
do just a little bit of math and come

121
00:08:20,151 --> 00:08:22,460
to the punchline.
I say the Tigers,

122
00:08:22,461 --> 00:08:26,000
the CRM says the sum of the squares
and the two sides of the right triangle

123
00:08:26,001 --> 00:08:27,920
equals the square,
the high pod news.

124
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:32,720
Now this unknown mysterious
thing was my proper time.

125
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:35,960
We can solve this with taggers
equation for my proper time.

126
00:08:36,170 --> 00:08:41,170
And you get the time dilation equation
just as Einstein derived at in 1905.

127
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:44,030
So the point that I'd like to make here,

128
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:48,410
the takeaway message is that
special relativity is simple.

129
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:53,860
Once you make the one assumption that
the speed of light is the same in all

130
00:08:53,961 --> 00:08:56,790
frames as measured by
any observer provided,

131
00:08:56,791 --> 00:08:59,460
they're moving at a constant velocity.
But relative to other observers,

132
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:01,200
once you make that one assumption,

133
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:07,520
just ordinary plain geometry is
sufficient to derive pretty much the whole

134
00:09:09,691 --> 00:09:12,660
subject. Um, and so for
instance, in our book,

135
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:18,140
one of the things we do with
a very similar setup like
a photon clock set up is

136
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:23,690
we explain how to derive equals
mc squared with similar logic.

137
00:09:24,091 --> 00:09:27,600
Now obviously you can't do that all with
plain geometry because there's a little

138
00:09:27,601 --> 00:09:31,350
bit of physics and telling you what
he is and what em is and so forth.

139
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,070
But if you,

140
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:37,070
if you just follow your
nose in understanding what
the physics concepts are,

141
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:40,050
then a little bit of plane
geometry is enough to,

142
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:43,620
to get even into the main
depth of special relativity.

143
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:48,660
But general relativity
is quite a bit different.

144
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:52,830
And I'm going to turn it over to
France to have a first go at that.

145
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:55,071
Okay.
All right.

146
00:09:55,071 --> 00:09:58,220
So now that we want to sort of ancient
need the goalies to explain with black

147
00:09:58,221 --> 00:10:01,480
holes are, um, and the,

148
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:04,740
the solution that the black or solutions
that were first discovered by swatch.

149
00:10:04,741 --> 00:10:07,610
So very soon after Einstein
discovered a January activity.

150
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:12,770
That's surprisingly simple. The geometry
is so incredibly beautiful and simple.

151
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:18,080
Um, but what it implies is very
bizarre and very confusing. In fact,

152
00:10:18,081 --> 00:10:21,170
Einstein did not accept a lot of
the aspects of those solutions.

153
00:10:21,171 --> 00:10:25,850
He never believed in black holes even
until the day he died in, in the, in 1955.

154
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:27,050
Um,

155
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:31,730
so that Steve introduced one aspect
of special relativity time dilation.

156
00:10:31,731 --> 00:10:36,731
So relative motion introduces a sort of
a or observers perceived different time

157
00:10:38,181 --> 00:10:39,320
based on relative motion.

158
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:43,100
So I'm going to explain one aspect or
described black holes from the perspective

159
00:10:43,101 --> 00:10:47,570
of time violation. So now we have
to go to general activity. Uh,

160
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:52,130
uh, and what is new about
generativity? So as special activity,

161
00:10:52,131 --> 00:10:54,470
it's a theory about space
and time or space time.

162
00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:57,680
But where is in special activity?
Space Time is flat.

163
00:10:57,710 --> 00:11:01,040
It's given by this Fingal them in
calcium metric. Now in January,

164
00:11:01,041 --> 00:11:04,080
the tivity spacetime can be
curved and it can be dynamical.

165
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:09,650
And what produces curvature in space time
is matter and energy. So for example,

166
00:11:09,651 --> 00:11:13,940
this cartoonish picture of, of the earth,
I mean the earth has a lot of matter.

167
00:11:13,941 --> 00:11:18,340
It's, it's a very heavy object.
Um, and so in, in general activity,

168
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:20,510
earth is cooling space,
time around it.

169
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:24,230
And we sort of representing it here with
this, imagine the curvature of space,

170
00:11:24,231 --> 00:11:25,430
time to be the surface.

171
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:27,710
And so you can sort of imagine that
the earth is denning and so the,

172
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:31,050
the earth producers curvature
in space and time. Um,

173
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:33,110
one aspect of that curvature,

174
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:36,800
sort of connecting to the time
dilation is curvature producer's time,

175
00:11:36,801 --> 00:11:41,150
dilation regardless of relative motion,
something special relativity.

176
00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:44,420
When we were moving relative to each
other that we perceive time dilation.

177
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:49,130
But now what the earth is doing is
if you had a clock that someone,

178
00:11:49,131 --> 00:11:51,860
they're just sitting there on the surface
of the earth like we are and someone

179
00:11:51,861 --> 00:11:54,940
very, very far away the clocks
near the surface of the earth.

180
00:11:54,941 --> 00:11:59,200
We're run a little bit slower due
to the curvature of space time. Um,

181
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:04,180
okay. So we're going to use this ideal
that they've curvature introduces time

182
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:07,330
donations to get two black holes.
You can go to the next slide.

183
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:12,290
So to one,
as I mentioned in general activity,

184
00:12:12,291 --> 00:12:15,700
it's matter and energy that produces
curvature to produce more curvature.

185
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:19,270
The theory says you need to take a certain
amount of matter and energy and make

186
00:12:19,271 --> 00:12:23,470
it as dense, denser, and
denser, more compact, and
you'll produce more curvature.

187
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,270
So let's sort of take again,

188
00:12:25,271 --> 00:12:30,250
the same idea of no till characterizing
curvature by this sort of denting the

189
00:12:30,251 --> 00:12:32,710
surface and just take
a now a story or say,

190
00:12:32,711 --> 00:12:37,490
imagine the sun because the sun is much,
much more massive than the earth. Um,

191
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:41,230
that 10 to the 32
kilograms and it's about a,

192
00:12:41,231 --> 00:12:45,460
about a million kilometers across. Now
of course, at the surface of the sun,

193
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:47,660
there's quite a bit more curvature and so,

194
00:12:47,661 --> 00:12:50,320
but more time violation than
you're at the surface of the earth.

195
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:53,650
But now our tail activity says if we
could somehow compress the sun down to a

196
00:12:53,651 --> 00:12:58,510
much smaller radius, so where the surface
used to be, it will be exactly the same.

197
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:00,460
But now we're taking
all the spatter energy,

198
00:13:00,461 --> 00:13:02,440
compressing it into a much smaller volume.

199
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:05,230
And so now if we get closer to
that higher curvature region,

200
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:08,530
there's going to be more time dilation
and this sort of what the sequence is

201
00:13:08,531 --> 00:13:11,710
showing. Um, now a star like the sun,

202
00:13:11,711 --> 00:13:15,490
when it uses up all of its nuclear fuel,
it's eventually going to go supernova.

203
00:13:15,491 --> 00:13:18,550
And the core, the remnant
is going to collapse to
something called a white dwarf,

204
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:23,890
which is almost as massive as as the sun.
Um, but now it's much more compressed.

205
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:28,540
It's about the size of the few thousand
kilometers across. So of course,

206
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:29,890
near the surface of the white wolf,

207
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:33,200
there's going to be a quite a lot of
time dilation, a lot of curvature. Um,

208
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:36,850
and now we can say, oh, can
we go further? How am I,

209
00:13:36,851 --> 00:13:40,780
how much time dilation in principle
could we get all four styles that are

210
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:44,020
perhaps 10 times the mass of the sun when
they go through their nuclear burning

211
00:13:44,021 --> 00:13:48,550
phase? A, they sort of, they lose all
of the energy, do prevent, uh, you know,

212
00:13:48,551 --> 00:13:51,910
to hold them up against gravity.
And when they collapsed down,

213
00:13:51,911 --> 00:13:55,740
they won't collapse down into a white
dwarf, but to a neutron store, uh,

214
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:59,270
which is an incredibly dense object.
Again, these things weigh, you know,

215
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:00,460
round the mass of the sun.

216
00:14:00,461 --> 00:14:03,640
But in typical neutron star might
be 10 to 20 kilometers in radius.

217
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:06,190
So something the mass of the sun,
you know,

218
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:08,800
compress down to something
the size of Manhattan.

219
00:14:08,801 --> 00:14:12,220
It's almost absurdly
deigns to think about it.

220
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:17,800
Now for neutron stars, the curvature is
so strong near the surface of the time.

221
00:14:17,801 --> 00:14:20,920
Dilation becomes, you know, significant
things that we can easily think about.

222
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:23,380
It might be a factor of 20 to 30%.

223
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:26,920
So if you were on the surface of the
nutrients story or clock would run slower

224
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:32,190
by you know, 20 to 30% compared to
someone that's far away. As I say,

225
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,720
Oh,
let's go further it,

226
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:38,110
we don't think that there's a form
of matter that sort of more dense the

227
00:14:38,111 --> 00:14:41,380
nutrients Oswald supposedly supposedly
could contract a neutron story even

228
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:42,510
further.
Um,

229
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:46,110
like what this image is suggesting is
that the more we can sort of more we

230
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:49,060
pressurize it,
the stronger curvature becomes 60 old.

231
00:14:49,061 --> 00:14:51,130
Can we compress it down to a kilometer?

232
00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:55,580
Can we compress it down to the same team
leader? So the curvature becomes very,

233
00:14:55,581 --> 00:14:59,270
very large and the time dilation can
become an arbitrary large factor.

234
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:03,960
And the answer is no.
You relativity something very,

235
00:15:03,961 --> 00:15:08,150
very interesting happens when you try to
compress it to within what's called the

236
00:15:08,151 --> 00:15:09,740
swatch sold radius of the object.

237
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:12,470
So for something like the
size of the mass of the sun,

238
00:15:12,471 --> 00:15:16,610
that's about a radius of three kilometers
or them diameter of six kilometers.

239
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:19,550
So if you to try to take all of
that matter and compress it down,

240
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:22,520
when it reaches to a point of that,
that swatch total radius,

241
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:26,120
this character of space
time starts to change.

242
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:29,480
And spacetime undergoes what's
called gravitational collapse.

243
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:34,160
And surprisingly at that surface,
which isn't really a surface,

244
00:15:34,161 --> 00:15:37,210
it's a place in space time. So, and
think of it as a surface. Um, it's,

245
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:41,720
we define it as a surface. It's a sphere
of a certain radius there at a time.

246
00:15:41,721 --> 00:15:46,280
Dilation goes to infinity.
So if you were at that finite radius,

247
00:15:46,281 --> 00:15:50,180
your clock would stop relative to
an observers that infinity. Um,

248
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:53,150
and, but, uh, you know, if you imagined,

249
00:15:53,151 --> 00:15:56,990
try to compare some new that actually
it's a bit of a misnomer to think that

250
00:15:57,050 --> 00:16:00,380
time is actually stopping, but
spacetime is really changing character.

251
00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:04,580
The matter collapses, collapses down to
a singularity and that's a black hole.

252
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,430
So now you can explain,

253
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:09,070
well let me,
uh,

254
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:14,280
let me use a couple of my simple demos
to reinforce what friends are saying

255
00:16:14,951 --> 00:16:16,480
about time, dilation, elation.

256
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:22,070
And what I've got here first is an
illustration of how time runs at different

257
00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:28,990
elevations
and a shoretel geometry.

258
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:33,910
And this is even relevant
right here in this building.

259
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:35,830
Let's watch it again.

260
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:41,190
You see that my clock being relatively
high up in the Schwartzwald geometry runs

261
00:16:42,671 --> 00:16:47,671
faster because I'm experiencing less
gravitational redshift and francaise runs

262
00:16:47,711 --> 00:16:52,060
slower. But the Schwartz, you'll
geometry is really all around us.

263
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:57,120
It is an excellent approximation of the
space time geometry that we experience

264
00:16:58,060 --> 00:16:59,380
above the surface of the earth.

265
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:03,580
So if this is fronds on the first floor
of this building and here we are on the

266
00:17:03,581 --> 00:17:04,414
10th floor,

267
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:09,790
then it really is true that
our clock runs a little faster.

268
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:11,550
In other words,
the people on the 10th floor,

269
00:17:11,570 --> 00:17:13,660
it can get more work done in the day,

270
00:17:14,590 --> 00:17:17,710
but the price is the age
quicker in the process.

271
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:19,930
No free lunches.

272
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:25,260
And you see now wall clock time here
is arbitrarily distant observer and the

273
00:17:27,041 --> 00:17:31,630
suction observers clock runs
even faster than mine. After all,

274
00:17:31,631 --> 00:17:36,060
I am still fairly close to the horizon
and I, you know, everything is,

275
00:17:36,061 --> 00:17:40,120
is so simple just because I'm not up to
drawing these beautiful funnel shapes

276
00:17:40,170 --> 00:17:42,460
for firstborn child,
but it's a otherwise,

277
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:47,020
it's actually an mathematically accurate
depiction of the [inaudible], um, metric.

278
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:52,770
Now let's have one more thought experiment
where frauds and I start at the same

279
00:17:55,531 --> 00:18:00,260
elevation in the Schwartzel
geometry and I jump,

280
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:03,300
but we're assuming that I'm
a tremendously good jumper.

281
00:18:03,301 --> 00:18:05,430
So even though I'm close
to the black hole horizon,

282
00:18:05,431 --> 00:18:08,880
I can still do it and move up
at nearly the speed of light

283
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:15,210
and then I come back down
and, and, and land. Okay, so,

284
00:18:15,211 --> 00:18:20,211
so now a striking feature is that my
clock has gone through more ticks than

285
00:18:23,611 --> 00:18:27,210
Francis. And if you remember that the
twin paradox that we started with,

286
00:18:27,211 --> 00:18:30,990
I might seem very odd because
when we did the twin paradox,

287
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:34,860
the accelerated observed
accelerating observer, namely me,

288
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:38,760
the guy you ran across the stage and back
was the one who had fewer ticks on his

289
00:18:38,761 --> 00:18:43,020
clock. But now it's, it seems like
it's the accelerating observer

290
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:51,040
and who has more ticks on his
clock that is the secret to Anon,

291
00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:55,950
none of their pill.
Another pillar of relativity theory,

292
00:18:56,280 --> 00:19:01,280
which is that the natural
motion of objects is the
path that maximizes the time

293
00:19:05,131 --> 00:19:06,660
elapsed for that object.

294
00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:11,940
So actually frauds in this animation
is doing a very unnatural thing.

295
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:17,160
He somehow hovering at a fixed
elevation in a block of old geometry.

296
00:19:17,161 --> 00:19:20,520
So we have to have like a rocket ship
or asked me standing on some surface.

297
00:19:20,521 --> 00:19:24,780
It's very unnatural.
Whereas I can just boost off.

298
00:19:24,810 --> 00:19:28,290
And then for the entire
duration of the animation,

299
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:33,120
I am following a perfectly ballistic
trajectory with no force at all.

300
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:34,770
So most properly,

301
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:39,980
I should think of myself as the free
falling observer and France as you know,

302
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:45,270
the, the less natural observer who, who
manages therefore it is to stay younger.

303
00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:51,510
Okay. And just for entertainment,
I modify this demo.

304
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:53,760
Well,
uh,

305
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:59,480
well where did they come
upstairs so that I would not stop

306
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:05,880
when I got back down to francaise level.
Um,

307
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:10,640
let's just say I keep going
toward the horizon. Okay. So, oh,

308
00:20:10,641 --> 00:20:14,030
what's happening there?
Something extreme happen there.

309
00:20:14,031 --> 00:20:16,160
Let's make sure it's
really clear on the screen.

310
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:17,733
MMM.

311
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:22,060
Time dilation. Got extremely intense. See,

312
00:20:22,061 --> 00:20:27,061
my clock is running and running and
running and I got more texts on my clock,

313
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:31,540
but now it's consoling down tremendously.

314
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:36,970
And this is because I'm getting close
to the black hole horizon and my

315
00:20:36,971 --> 00:20:39,370
gravitational red shift becomes extreme.

316
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:46,930
Okay. So then just explain a little
bit about what I mentioned before.

317
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,033
Um,

318
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:51,760
with the character of space time
changes completely ones as gravitational

319
00:20:51,761 --> 00:20:52,660
collapse happens.

320
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:57,220
So what I mean by that
is outside a black hole,

321
00:20:57,310 --> 00:21:01,980
like this spacetime is what's called
static. Um, so the pretty the,

322
00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:04,600
there's a strong curvature but
it's not changing with time.

323
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:08,230
And in particular a w
one way to describe it,

324
00:21:08,231 --> 00:21:10,090
if you some distance
away from the black hole,

325
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:11,800
you just experienced the same curvature.

326
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:14,740
And so let's measure distance
by radius from the black hole.

327
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:16,150
So the swatch total radius,

328
00:21:16,151 --> 00:21:19,540
that's they've enterprise and see again
for something the size of the sun that

329
00:21:19,541 --> 00:21:22,450
will be the radius would be about three
kilometers, three the mass of the sun.

330
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:25,360
So if you some distance away,
yeah,

331
00:21:25,361 --> 00:21:29,380
you experience strong curvature but
the space time doesn't change at all.

332
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:35,140
Now if you approach the horizon and
then when you cross it spacetime changes

333
00:21:35,141 --> 00:21:39,460
character completely inputting in
particular what you thought of as this

334
00:21:39,461 --> 00:21:42,520
distance radius and what
you thought of as time.

335
00:21:42,690 --> 00:21:45,010
The time coordinated
completely flipped character,

336
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:48,940
they completely switched roles.
And so as you cross the horizon,

337
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:53,950
spacetime suddenly becomes intrinsically
dynamical and all of space space and

338
00:21:53,951 --> 00:21:56,860
time is being swept down to the
singularity or are equal zero.

339
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:01,760
And what sort of alarming about
that? Well, first of all, and that,

340
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:06,100
that's also one way to think of why the,
the, this, the surface of swa shoulder,

341
00:22:06,101 --> 00:22:07,330
eight way this,
uh,

342
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:11,110
this sort of area of the swatch or radius
is nearby winterize and you can ever

343
00:22:11,111 --> 00:22:14,740
go back is if we passed you date while
you can't go faster than the speed of

344
00:22:14,741 --> 00:22:18,700
light. Or another way of saying that is
you only go forwards in time is a natural

345
00:22:18,701 --> 00:22:21,850
direction, which is forwards and time.
And you can't go backwards in time.

346
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:27,010
So moving to like, let's say there's a
black hole over here, um, you know, I'm,

347
00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:30,070
I've read our books,
I know you shouldn't cross the horizon,

348
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:33,760
but somehow accidentally wandering
across the horizon. And again,

349
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:35,740
the horizon isn't like a solid surface.

350
00:22:35,741 --> 00:22:40,090
It's really just this point in space time.
And so like, oh dear, what's happened?

351
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:44,800
Well, I've gone from larger
radius to smaller radius
crossing the horizon and I'm

352
00:22:44,801 --> 00:22:48,670
going forwards in time. And now I've said
suddenly when you inside the horizon,

353
00:22:48,671 --> 00:22:52,090
radius is actually measuring time.
And so by continuity,

354
00:22:52,091 --> 00:22:54,610
the forward direction in time
is going to smaller radius.

355
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:58,960
So suddenly once you're inside spacetime
has become dynamical in this flow of

356
00:22:58,961 --> 00:23:01,540
space. Time is taking from
larger to smaller radius.

357
00:23:02,050 --> 00:23:05,470
So now I panic because I heard that
there's a singularity inside the back.

358
00:23:05,471 --> 00:23:06,010
One Sec.

359
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:10,210
How can I get out or getting out means
you want to go to a larger radius again

360
00:23:10,330 --> 00:23:13,090
but you can because that would
mean going backwards in time.

361
00:23:13,091 --> 00:23:17,200
And so you do right so big
because of the nature of time.

362
00:23:17,290 --> 00:23:21,310
You can't escape the horizon. We going
out with the why. Why are you doing?

363
00:23:21,311 --> 00:23:23,440
What's bad about being
caught up in this flow?

364
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:28,420
Well there's a singularity in the
geometry at what was or equal zero.

365
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:30,100
They're sort of the origin.

366
00:23:30,850 --> 00:23:34,600
And again when you're outside the black
hole you can say okay our equal zero

367
00:23:34,601 --> 00:23:36,340
lets aware I can avoid it.

368
00:23:36,910 --> 00:23:40,540
But now you've crossover and suddenly
it's like okay where's the singularity?

369
00:23:40,541 --> 00:23:43,810
What can I do to avoid it? Which
directions? Right accelerating.

370
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:48,530
But that's the wrong question anymore
because our doesn't measure radial

371
00:23:48,531 --> 00:23:50,150
distance anymore.
It measures time.

372
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:53,500
And so the right question is when
is the singularity and the answer?

373
00:23:53,501 --> 00:23:55,760
It's in your future.
So you can't avoid it.

374
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:58,800
And in fact it doesn't matter the guy.

375
00:23:58,810 --> 00:24:00,980
So it doesn't matter which
direction you accelerating,

376
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:04,670
you're going to get to the singularity.
And in fact, uh, did this, this,

377
00:24:04,671 --> 00:24:07,460
this principle that Steve mentioned
that the natural path sort of,

378
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,920
you maximize the time that you take.

379
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:13,430
So if you want to survive for as
long as possible, just let go.

380
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:17,270
Just relax and free, fall into
the singularity. Don't accelerate.

381
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:21,740
Okay. But um, let me
just also just mention,

382
00:24:21,770 --> 00:24:26,770
this also tells us why the singularity
is such a bad thing because this,

383
00:24:27,051 --> 00:24:31,700
our coordinate that outside is radius
inside this time serves two purposes.

384
00:24:31,701 --> 00:24:35,990
One is it also tells you what the area
of us of a sphere is of that particular

385
00:24:35,991 --> 00:24:38,630
radius, right? So it gives
you some sense of how low,

386
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:42,260
how large spaces in a certain radius.

387
00:24:42,261 --> 00:24:44,270
And it's the same outside and inside.

388
00:24:44,271 --> 00:24:47,390
So inside it's also measuring
the area of a sphere.

389
00:24:47,810 --> 00:24:50,840
So now you cross the black hole,
you're at a certain radius.

390
00:24:50,841 --> 00:24:53,540
But now time going forward
means radius decrease.

391
00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:56,990
So that means space is really
collapsing down to a point.

392
00:24:58,670 --> 00:24:59,451
And even worse,

393
00:24:59,451 --> 00:25:04,451
what was time outside is now it's an
hour coordinate that represents distance

394
00:25:04,671 --> 00:25:08,770
and that distance is being
stretched out. So this radius, uh,

395
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:12,320
there's the area of a sphere of being
squashed down to zero and the radius

396
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:13,213
diverges.

397
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:17,450
So this is the sort of spaghetti buying
singularity just by the nature of space

398
00:25:17,451 --> 00:25:21,110
and time, everything gets stretched and
squeezed into an infinitely thin line.

399
00:25:21,410 --> 00:25:25,310
So very, very, very bad place. Okay.

400
00:25:25,311 --> 00:25:29,090
So now with, with all of that
description, you know, you say,

401
00:25:29,091 --> 00:25:31,010
I that sounds bizarre,

402
00:25:31,011 --> 00:25:35,330
it sounds kind of ridiculous and that's
perhaps why people like Einstein ever

403
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:39,080
really bothered to take this aspect
of the swatch old solution. Seriously.

404
00:25:39,370 --> 00:25:39,800
You know,

405
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:43,760
he accepted that at describes things
far outside of bodies like the earth,

406
00:25:43,790 --> 00:25:47,900
but the material in the earth means that
inside it's not the swatch or solution,

407
00:25:47,901 --> 00:25:52,070
it's something different, which is
perfectly fine. Um, so he, you know,

408
00:25:52,071 --> 00:25:55,300
he didn't really spend too much time
thinking about and dismissed or doesn't

409
00:25:55,310 --> 00:25:58,700
physical. But then over
the last, you know, 40,

410
00:25:58,701 --> 00:26:02,750
50 years essentially starting in the
sixties and seventies, um, you know,

411
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,540
through a combination of theory
and astronomy observations,

412
00:26:05,541 --> 00:26:09,220
we started to think that they actually
are these things out there that black

413
00:26:09,221 --> 00:26:13,610
holes actually might exist in the universe
that says it.

414
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:18,460
But I mean, as I've just explained,
there's a very bizarre predictions.

415
00:26:18,461 --> 00:26:21,530
So you want to say if we're going to
say that there really is something so

416
00:26:21,531 --> 00:26:22,550
bizarre happening out there,

417
00:26:22,551 --> 00:26:25,730
that there's someplace out there with
this gravitational collapse is happening

418
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:27,440
with time completely flips,

419
00:26:27,890 --> 00:26:31,340
flips on its head and drags everything
down to a singularity, you know,

420
00:26:31,341 --> 00:26:34,040
to paraphrase call sake.
And it's an extraordinary claim.

421
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:37,520
We need extraordinary evidence. So
you can go to the next slide. Well,

422
00:26:37,521 --> 00:26:39,320
what evidence do we have?

423
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:44,640
And I say until a couple of years ago
in Lego made their historic discovery,

424
00:26:44,641 --> 00:26:46,650
which we'll talk about a little bit later.
Um,

425
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:50,100
I say the evidence was getting very, very
strong, but it was all circumstantial.

426
00:26:50,670 --> 00:26:54,570
And you're a couple of examples of the,
the, the good evidence that there was,

427
00:26:54,571 --> 00:26:56,760
but circumstantial.
Um,

428
00:26:57,630 --> 00:27:01,380
this is a picture of looking towards
the dynamical central of our galaxy.

429
00:27:01,381 --> 00:27:04,620
So it's about 30,000 light years away.
And so this is,

430
00:27:04,621 --> 00:27:06,750
it's a very small frame of you,

431
00:27:06,751 --> 00:27:10,220
just probably a fraction of
the Lightyear across. Um,

432
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:15,180
and this is showing that astronomers
are these bright objects here or stores.

433
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:17,900
Um,
and so it's showing an extraordinary,

434
00:27:17,930 --> 00:27:20,520
over the past 20 years I've been
tracking the positions of these,

435
00:27:20,550 --> 00:27:23,010
of these stores. And
you can see, well they,

436
00:27:23,011 --> 00:27:26,310
they're orbiting what looks like
the dynamical centre of our galaxy,

437
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:30,200
but there's nothing there.
So they, they're Aubrey,

438
00:27:30,210 --> 00:27:32,490
there's obviously something
that's keeping them in orbit.

439
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,380
And if you just apply Kepler's laws,

440
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:36,690
you can deduce that there
must be something there.

441
00:27:36,690 --> 00:27:39,270
It's 4.4 million times
the mass of the sun.

442
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:43,290
So they're just finishing so years
something that's the mass of the sun.

443
00:27:43,291 --> 00:27:44,124
It's bright.

444
00:27:44,310 --> 00:27:47,460
But there is something that's 4 million
times the mass of the sun and we don't

445
00:27:47,461 --> 00:27:52,200
see it. What could it possibly be? So
that doesn't show it's a black hole.

446
00:27:52,410 --> 00:27:55,700
But if it were a black hole,
that would be consistent because this,

447
00:27:56,080 --> 00:28:00,270
there's the radio for back all that
larger whatever radius of about 12 million

448
00:28:00,271 --> 00:28:03,540
kilometers.
So in the 30,000 light years away,

449
00:28:03,541 --> 00:28:06,180
it's going to be sub pixel size on that.

450
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:11,280
That is another example of the good
evidence has been gathering over the years

451
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:15,450
is in the circle of
stellar binary systems.

452
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:17,900
So this is an artist's depiction of,
uh,

453
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:21,890
the store in orbit around the putative
black hole. And again, similarly,

454
00:28:21,891 --> 00:28:24,990
there's what is observed is all
the black hole is and observed,

455
00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:30,060
but this story is observed. And so this
stories like wobbling back and forth in,

456
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:34,320
you know, with time, but it's
companion isn't seen. And again,

457
00:28:34,321 --> 00:28:37,440
you can apply Kepler's laws and for
these stellar mass black holes in many

458
00:28:37,441 --> 00:28:41,790
candidates where it's inferred that
the companion is, you know, 10, 15,

459
00:28:41,791 --> 00:28:45,480
20 times the mass of the
sun. And again, the puzzle,

460
00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:49,440
what could possibly be be that massive
compose the ordinary matter and that we

461
00:28:49,441 --> 00:28:53,250
don't see it. So again, it's a proof that
it's a black hole, but it's consistent.

462
00:28:53,251 --> 00:28:55,950
If it were a black hole, that's exactly
what we did, what it would look like.

463
00:28:56,940 --> 00:29:01,800
So I think, you know, over the years
the evidence has been gathering,

464
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:04,830
but as you can see, it's circumstantial.
We're not seeing the black hole,

465
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:08,290
we seeing the effects of the black
hole and surrounding stars or,

466
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:12,750
or the story in this case. He's
now. Now that all changed, you know,

467
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:16,920
a couple of years ago and
now you've probably all seen
this IOP. But this is the,

468
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:17,821
this in fact,

469
00:29:17,821 --> 00:29:22,500
this was the first gravitational waves
detected by the LIGO collaboration,

470
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:26,610
um, that represents the inspiral
and merger of two black holes.

471
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:30,330
So just to sort of briefly,

472
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:34,300
so stars can be in binary stars can
collapse. We think two black holes,

473
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:38,970
black holes can be in binaries.
So two black holes can be
orbiting each other. Uh,

474
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,470
if it's, uh, if you have a
single isolated black hole,

475
00:29:41,710 --> 00:29:44,620
is it like from outside it's a
static space time. Nothing happens.

476
00:29:44,890 --> 00:29:46,750
But if you tap two black
holes in Olberding,

477
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:49,930
you've essentially got masses in energies.
It's accelerating.

478
00:29:50,530 --> 00:29:52,780
And generativity says
that when that happens,

479
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:54,730
you can actually produce
gravitational waves,

480
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:58,300
which are these ripples in the geometry
of space that propagate output at the

481
00:29:58,301 --> 00:30:03,040
speed of light. So two black holes in
orbit are producing gravitational waves,

482
00:30:03,370 --> 00:30:07,500
but that's carrying away energy from the
system. And so the way that that reacts,

483
00:30:07,501 --> 00:30:10,060
but back on the binaries
that they spiral in.

484
00:30:10,061 --> 00:30:13,960
So the system is losing energy to
gravitational waves to closer to the gate.

485
00:30:13,961 --> 00:30:16,510
The fast they start to spiral,
the more they emit.

486
00:30:16,511 --> 00:30:20,350
So sort of a runaway process initially
it starts out very, very slowly.

487
00:30:20,351 --> 00:30:22,720
So these black holes,
poly started, you know,

488
00:30:22,721 --> 00:30:25,300
formed a buy a new billions
of years before they merged,

489
00:30:25,570 --> 00:30:28,270
but it slowly ramps up and,
and then it's a runaway process.

490
00:30:28,510 --> 00:30:32,350
And we've seen the last few orbits of
the life of this binary as a two black

491
00:30:32,351 --> 00:30:35,380
holes orbit spiraling to each
other and form a larger black hole.

492
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:41,320
Why this in terms of like showing that
this is, that calls, why it's different,

493
00:30:41,321 --> 00:30:43,270
sort of qualitatively
different from before.

494
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:46,330
I said before were circumstantial
because we've seen other things,

495
00:30:46,331 --> 00:30:48,760
we've seen photons and
inferring their black holes.

496
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:53,710
But here there's this patent that the
structure of the waves is really coming

497
00:30:53,711 --> 00:30:57,730
from the world emotional space time
about these horizons of a black hole.

498
00:30:57,731 --> 00:31:01,870
So it's really telling us what geometry
is doing in the vicinity of the horizons.

499
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:04,690
Of course,
it can't tell us what's going on inside.

500
00:31:04,691 --> 00:31:07,540
So that's always going to be a
mystery if relativities right.

501
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:11,500
Nothing can escape the black or not live
in inflammation in gravitational waves.

502
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:16,120
But at least up until these new, from
outside toward, towards this point,

503
00:31:16,121 --> 00:31:18,250
we've gravitational collapse
is presumably happening.

504
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:21,700
This is really a signature of what space
time is doing. Right, right, right.

505
00:31:21,701 --> 00:31:25,720
At that point. So I'll briefly, um,

506
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:29,280
just in words,
describe what,

507
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:33,640
what gravitational waves are and how we,
how Lygo actually detected them.

508
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:35,400
So again,
the,

509
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:39,610
the ripples in the geometry of space
and time and they propagate outwards and

510
00:31:39,611 --> 00:31:42,490
one property of their best safe.
Imagine a gravitational wave.

511
00:31:42,491 --> 00:31:45,940
There's sort of moving
directly into the screen. Um,

512
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,730
it's changing distances because it's
a, it's a ripple in geometry. Um,

513
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:53,020
but it changes distances
in a very particular way.

514
00:31:53,021 --> 00:31:56,980
So there are protocol two
polarizations one polarization.

515
00:31:57,250 --> 00:31:59,500
If the gravitational wave
is moving yet one instant,

516
00:31:59,501 --> 00:32:03,790
it will stretch the screen in a
horizontal direction while simultaneously

517
00:32:03,791 --> 00:32:07,030
squeezing it in the vertical direction.
And as a cycle happens,

518
00:32:07,031 --> 00:32:08,650
it will oscillate back,
back and forth.

519
00:32:08,651 --> 00:32:13,180
So stretching and squeezing
in what's called the plastic
configuration, you know,

520
00:32:13,181 --> 00:32:15,130
sort of just by the geometry.

521
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:18,070
Now the polarization is called
the cross polarization and says,

522
00:32:18,071 --> 00:32:21,160
rotated by 45 degrees.
So the key thing is,

523
00:32:21,310 --> 00:32:23,170
as the gravitational wave propagates,

524
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:27,520
transfers to the direction of propagation
as inducing this oscillatory change in

525
00:32:27,521 --> 00:32:30,460
distance and sort of measure
of gravitational wave,

526
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:33,970
we want to measure changes in distance
as we want to construct a ruler.

527
00:32:34,810 --> 00:32:38,320
It turns out that it's an incredibly
sensitive or that we have to construct.

528
00:32:38,321 --> 00:32:43,040
And that's what Lygo has been
doing over the last, since the 60s.

529
00:32:43,041 --> 00:32:46,850
It was planned, it's been under con
funding and construction since the 90s.

530
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:50,120
Think now,
Steve is going to demonstrate that.

531
00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:53,080
Okay. So first let's see it, um,

532
00:32:53,350 --> 00:32:58,350
worth yet one more animation where what
I've done is I've taken a picture of an

533
00:33:02,411 --> 00:33:07,411
interferometer directly
from the Ligo collaboration.

534
00:33:08,231 --> 00:33:12,700
I think this will play better. Change
the size. Okay, let's see how this goes.

535
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:15,460
Um,
so,

536
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:20,580
so first I want to show this plus
pattern of gravitational radiation,

537
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:24,940
what it would do to this device that
I'm showing on the screen if it hits the

538
00:33:24,941 --> 00:33:26,380
screen justice fronds described.

539
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:32,560
So it's stretching and
squeezing the device itself.

540
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:38,470
And I tried to animate it in such a way
that that beam splitter in the middle

541
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:40,900
stays more or less stationary,

542
00:33:40,901 --> 00:33:44,350
but you know what we mean by stationary
and a dynamical space time is a little

543
00:33:44,351 --> 00:33:46,540
bit up for grabs anyway.
What we,

544
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:51,600
we definitely can't know is what is the
relative length of the two long arms of

545
00:33:54,761 --> 00:33:55,720
the interferometer.

546
00:33:56,230 --> 00:34:01,230
And the way we measure it is we have
some laser here which shoots coherent

547
00:34:02,711 --> 00:34:03,550
photons.

548
00:34:04,330 --> 00:34:08,950
Half of them go through the beam splitter
straight on and half of them go the

549
00:34:08,951 --> 00:34:11,410
other way.
But it's a quantum phenomenon.

550
00:34:11,411 --> 00:34:14,770
So really every photon
explorers both paths

551
00:34:16,390 --> 00:34:21,390
the photons bounce back off the mirrors
and they recombine at the beam splitter,

552
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:23,800
each photon recombined with itself.

553
00:34:23,801 --> 00:34:28,801
Because remember it explored both paths
and depending on whether those paths are

554
00:34:30,611 --> 00:34:34,900
exactly the same length or
slightly different lengths,

555
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:40,140
the photon might either reinforce itself
or cancel itself out as it traveled on

556
00:34:42,670 --> 00:34:46,480
to the readout device.
And, and so we have,

557
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:51,010
we have a little demonstration
scale model of Lego,

558
00:34:51,011 --> 00:34:54,520
which is really working just as I showed,

559
00:34:54,970 --> 00:34:59,800
let's get house lights down a little
bit on this is a little bit dim.

560
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:04,840
And the reason it's dim is that we're
using a teeny weeny little laser like a

561
00:35:04,841 --> 00:35:05,674
laser pointer.

562
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:09,640
We have bigger lasers or more powerful
lasers in the physics department,

563
00:35:09,641 --> 00:35:12,580
but they wouldn't let me take one,
uh, to New York City cause you know,

564
00:35:12,581 --> 00:35:15,730
walk through Penn station with one of
those things and you're really taking your

565
00:35:15,731 --> 00:35:19,670
chances. Okay. So, um,
so you see the, these,

566
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:24,040
these stripes are
drifting down the screen.

567
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:28,480
The reason that's happening is the
whole device is warming up a little bit.

568
00:35:28,510 --> 00:35:32,020
And so all the angles and so forth
are just changing very, very slowly.

569
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:34,420
And it has nothing to do
really with the main physics.

570
00:35:34,670 --> 00:35:38,700
Dylan straight the main physics
first let me block one beam.

571
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:40,470
So if I blocked one beam,

572
00:35:40,770 --> 00:35:45,360
you see the stripey pattern has gone
and what's left is just some dim pattern

573
00:35:45,361 --> 00:35:47,630
with a little bit of features and such,
which,

574
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:52,530
which are only have to do with the
particular optical devices that I have in

575
00:35:52,531 --> 00:35:55,920
here. So you know, any flaw in the mirror
will show up as a little feature on the,

576
00:35:55,921 --> 00:35:58,860
on the screen. So if I, if
I blocked the other beam,

577
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:02,340
you can see again,
the pattern goes away.

578
00:36:02,550 --> 00:36:06,420
It's only when the two beams recombine
that you get this quantum year

579
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:09,270
interference between the
two just as I described.

580
00:36:09,510 --> 00:36:13,770
And then it's thrown up on the screen
where the d focusing lens. Okay.

581
00:36:13,771 --> 00:36:18,771
So now that the thermal expansion
has pretty much settled down,

582
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:21,690
if I juggle this thing in any way,

583
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:25,920
you can see that it, that the, uh,

584
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:29,790
interference pattern responds a lot.
And,

585
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:35,080
and the reason that it's responding is
that just a light touch on the base is

586
00:36:36,151 --> 00:36:39,990
causing the relative
weight of these two arms,

587
00:36:39,991 --> 00:36:41,810
this one and this one too,

588
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:46,860
to change by just enough like micron
sizes enough in order for the interference

589
00:36:47,791 --> 00:36:50,460
pattern to shift by about one
stripe. So, you know, just a,

590
00:36:50,610 --> 00:36:55,170
a light tap is about enough to cause
the interference pattern to tap,

591
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:58,010
to shift by, by, uh,
by one stripe. Whereas,

592
00:36:58,050 --> 00:37:01,470
but like it was really seeing is it
seeing something that's more vibrational?

593
00:37:01,710 --> 00:37:05,040
Like if I do this, you can see
it. It does ring a little bit.

594
00:37:05,041 --> 00:37:09,390
You can see these things like that.
That is what logo is actually watching,

595
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:14,820
except they watch it a heck of a lot
better than we can watch it here with this

596
00:37:14,850 --> 00:37:17,230
easy, meaty little
demonstration scale model. Um,

597
00:37:17,490 --> 00:37:21,570
I can measure differences in length
of, of, of relative life in these,

598
00:37:21,571 --> 00:37:25,010
in these two arms, two
about the micron scale. Uh,

599
00:37:25,290 --> 00:37:30,030
Lego with a four kilometer
arms and similar light,

600
00:37:30,550 --> 00:37:31,770
although far more intense,

601
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:36,600
is able to measure relative
length differences that
are less than the diameter

602
00:37:36,601 --> 00:37:40,080
of a proton. So it's an school
is at least sensitive device.

603
00:37:40,081 --> 00:37:42,420
I still understand that quite honestly.
Uh,

604
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:47,040
exactly all the treks that allow them
to measure things that are such small

605
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:50,370
links that are so much smaller than the
wavelength of light that they're using.

606
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:55,050
Um, so it's, it's quite an achievement
that that, as Ron's mentioned,

607
00:37:55,230 --> 00:37:57,510
was decades in the making.
Um,

608
00:37:57,780 --> 00:38:00,510
and there are certainly more games we
could play with this device. But let's,

609
00:38:00,511 --> 00:38:03,490
let's save it until
afterward. And, and uh,

610
00:38:04,130 --> 00:38:08,640
go back to the question of what are
these gravitational waves and how's the

611
00:38:08,641 --> 00:38:11,850
black hole really producing?
Okay.

612
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:18,880
Right.
So it's setting the,

613
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:21,520
the next thing would
just be an animation or

614
00:38:21,830 --> 00:38:23,600
sort of what it,
is that what I described.

615
00:38:26,330 --> 00:38:28,860
So this is a computer simulation of
two black holes merging in there.

616
00:38:28,861 --> 00:38:31,770
These are parameters that are similar
to the first event that was detected.

617
00:38:31,771 --> 00:38:35,860
The so you can play it. So these are two
black holes. They're orbiting each other.

618
00:38:36,270 --> 00:38:39,640
He sort of green, uh, sort
of this haze is going out.

619
00:38:39,641 --> 00:38:41,710
This is a representation
of the gravitational waves.

620
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:46,990
And so what you'll notice is as they're
orbiting, the amplitude is increasing.

621
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:50,170
So that's because they actually
slowly spiraling in runaway.

622
00:38:50,171 --> 00:38:53,050
The closer that they getting the
fast are they starting to move?

623
00:38:53,051 --> 00:38:57,740
The more energy they mud. And eventually
it gets brighter and brighter and they,

624
00:38:57,840 --> 00:39:01,960
they coalesce. When two black holes
meet, they form a larger black hole.

625
00:39:02,650 --> 00:39:05,020
And then you see this little
burst of radiation at the end.

626
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:08,660
And what's left you the sort of
this perfectly stationary, uh,

627
00:39:08,770 --> 00:39:13,600
rotating black hole. Um, now what,

628
00:39:13,630 --> 00:39:18,100
what things do, we did a lot of things
that are fascinating about this one event.

629
00:39:18,130 --> 00:39:21,880
Um, again, it represented, this is
another depiction of the way form.

630
00:39:21,881 --> 00:39:26,550
So it represented sort of from the
way that Lego saw that will patent,

631
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:28,570
we can infer the properties of the,
the black holes.

632
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:31,060
They were both about 30 times.
The mass of the sun.

633
00:39:31,061 --> 00:39:33,410
One's a little bit bigger
than the other one. Um,

634
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:38,320
does he slowed down tremendously. But we,
in real time, and Steve will show a demo,

635
00:39:38,321 --> 00:39:41,890
which sort of almost demonstrates
at least in a second,

636
00:39:42,750 --> 00:39:44,820
but if they read real realtime,
they go and get the fracture,

637
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:47,980
the sizable fraction of the speed of
light, 20, 30 times the speed of light.

638
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:52,000
And this scale is, uh, is about a
thousand kilometers for those things.

639
00:39:52,001 --> 00:39:53,830
So that's incredibly fast.

640
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:58,210
And what's perhaps more astonishing is
the energy that's released in this final

641
00:39:58,270 --> 00:40:02,440
final burst. Um, so it
happens in a few milliseconds.

642
00:40:02,441 --> 00:40:06,670
This final boost that you saw,
um, I mean that one instant,

643
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:11,370
if you just compute the, the, the
energy and gravitational waves, uh,

644
00:40:11,470 --> 00:40:15,040
it's brighter than all the visible style
out in the universe combined at one

645
00:40:15,041 --> 00:40:18,160
incident. That, that sounds like a
ridiculous statement, but it's true.

646
00:40:18,161 --> 00:40:22,120
So in gravity and gravitational waves
that outshines all the stars in the

647
00:40:22,121 --> 00:40:26,370
universe of that one incident,
right. I think we're about
out of time, one of, yeah,

648
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:29,910
sure. That's right. So now
I think, yeah. Okay. Uh, so

649
00:40:30,290 --> 00:40:34,820
this last demo is,
is aimed at showing you

650
00:40:38,050 --> 00:40:42,970
analogous mechanical system.
Um, let's see if we've got this.

651
00:40:46,270 --> 00:40:50,260
No, I have to restart quick
time. It always does this moment.

652
00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:58,980
So what I've got is a spinning disk
which settles down to a stationary state.

653
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:04,840
It's not really quite like a,

654
00:41:06,190 --> 00:41:10,240
not really quite like a black hole
merging of course with another black hole,

655
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:14,190
but it's in the same spirit
because for starters it's,

656
00:41:14,310 --> 00:41:18,550
it's exhibiting similar frequencies
of output. Now for similar reasons.

657
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:20,973
No,

658
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:24,790
it looks like

659
00:41:26,730 --> 00:41:29,580
I'm not going to have any
cooperation here from quick time.

660
00:41:30,150 --> 00:41:33,830
One more try and then I get
to go straight to the demo.

661
00:41:36,270 --> 00:41:40,640
Okay.
Recording.

662
00:41:51,620 --> 00:41:55,760
There we go.
Nope.

663
00:41:56,350 --> 00:41:59,450
All right. So this is nothing
more than a spinning coin.

664
00:42:02,030 --> 00:42:05,420
It's called [inaudible] disk for no
good reason. It's just a spinning coin.

665
00:42:05,421 --> 00:42:09,590
It's settling down and you can hear
already that it has some characteristic

666
00:42:09,591 --> 00:42:10,424
frequencies.

667
00:42:11,750 --> 00:42:16,010
And what we've got over here on
the right is a sound analyzer,

668
00:42:16,011 --> 00:42:20,030
which is picking up everything that
this microphone hears. So, for instance,

669
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:24,080
it's hearing my voice and
if I use a tuning fork,

670
00:42:25,340 --> 00:42:26,720
you can get

671
00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:33,950
a peak.
You see that about 128 hertz,

672
00:42:35,990 --> 00:42:39,250
let's Millie's eve. You can still see
that peak. If I, if I stopped talking,

673
00:42:39,270 --> 00:42:40,103
you can see it better.

674
00:42:47,540 --> 00:42:49,890
There's disk.
It takes a little while to settle down,

675
00:42:51,570 --> 00:42:54,750
but in its final stages,

676
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:59,790
what I liked about it is
that it's exhibiting the same
behavior as merging black

677
00:42:59,791 --> 00:43:04,791
holes in that the point of contact is
flipping around faster and faster and it's

678
00:43:05,581 --> 00:43:05,971
emitting,

679
00:43:05,971 --> 00:43:10,971
therefore a similar kind of Chirp only
in sound that colliding black holes in it

680
00:43:13,510 --> 00:43:14,910
in gravitational radiation.

681
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:24,230
And now I'll stop talking so you can see
the wave form on the spectrum analyzer.

682
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:41,140
Okay.
Dot.

683
00:43:41,330 --> 00:43:46,060
Chirp is very like the sound
of two merging black holes.

684
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:50,770
What's not so much like it is
that you see many overtones here.

685
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:56,040
You see some some down at about 30 hertz
and then all the way up to a strong one

686
00:43:56,170 --> 00:44:01,170
at about a hundred to 150 that's
because it's a dirty mechanical system.

687
00:44:02,410 --> 00:44:07,330
Just for contrast. Let's go back to one
of Franzia sides and you can see one,

688
00:44:07,331 --> 00:44:11,620
a much more beautiful system.
These swirling block holes are,

689
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:13,900
um,
let's show it.

690
00:44:16,090 --> 00:44:20,590
So this is what Lego saw.

691
00:44:21,340 --> 00:44:24,550
Their picture is tilted
90 degrees from mine.

692
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:29,710
When you see this is the way form,
there's the Chirp, same chirp that I saw,

693
00:44:29,890 --> 00:44:34,560
but there is no overtones because this
is a very pure tone coming from the

694
00:44:34,561 --> 00:44:37,530
Claudia black holes.
But at a rather similar frequency.

695
00:44:37,540 --> 00:44:41,130
You remember I was at about 150
hertz. Oh, there at about 150 hertz.

696
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:43,950
So if you could hear the black hole merge,
it would,

697
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:48,630
it would sound kind of like that.
So a great discovery.

698
00:44:49,110 --> 00:44:52,140
It really convinces us that
black holes are in the universe.

699
00:44:52,470 --> 00:44:55,890
And I think that's a good place to stop
for questions. Thank you. Thank you.

700
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:56,793
Okay.

701
00:45:01,940 --> 00:45:05,820
I folks who have a mic here. Oh, there's
no Mike set up. So if you have questions,

702
00:45:05,821 --> 00:45:06,900
I'll just pass this around.

703
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:17,560
So you told us that, uh,
close to the event horizon,

704
00:45:18,100 --> 00:45:22,190
the time dilation time
runs slower compared to,

705
00:45:22,191 --> 00:45:24,340
to an outside observer.
Right?

706
00:45:24,790 --> 00:45:28,080
So essentially all the physical
processes at the event horizon,

707
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:33,040
car running slower,
does that apply also to the contraction?

708
00:45:33,070 --> 00:45:35,290
Meaning ultimately do the black,

709
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:40,320
does the black hole actually even form
in the lifetime of the universe since the

710
00:45:40,451 --> 00:45:45,240
time is essentially slowing down
to a stencil that point? Yeah.

711
00:45:45,250 --> 00:45:48,940
So there's a, there's a Australia's
kind of answer to that, which is,

712
00:45:48,970 --> 00:45:53,560
it depends on who's clock you're
talking about. When, when we,

713
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:57,160
when we look from outside,
as you know,

714
00:45:57,161 --> 00:45:58,960
there's always a wall clock observers.

715
00:45:59,410 --> 00:46:04,030
What we can definitely say is
that once a black hole is formed,

716
00:46:04,690 --> 00:46:06,820
then from our perspective
as outside observers,

717
00:46:07,180 --> 00:46:09,760
nothing manages to fall in.

718
00:46:09,761 --> 00:46:14,680
It all kind of settles down into
the horizon, um, evermore gradually.

719
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:19,000
Um, but in terms of black
holes really forming,

720
00:46:19,001 --> 00:46:22,070
that's a bit different
because the gravitational
collapse isn't complete until

721
00:46:22,071 --> 00:46:26,120
it's really happened. So, so I would
say, I would say that in fact, yes,

722
00:46:26,140 --> 00:46:29,770
black holes really do form. Um, it's,

723
00:46:29,771 --> 00:46:31,380
it's best answered with,
you know,

724
00:46:31,630 --> 00:46:35,440
with space time you have to draw something
like a pen rose diagram and say that,

725
00:46:35,730 --> 00:46:40,720
that, that on any, on any
respectable time slice, yes,

726
00:46:40,750 --> 00:46:43,810
there is a black hole
that really has formed.

727
00:46:44,020 --> 00:46:49,020
It's just that the signals
move so strangely in the
block hole geometry that the

728
00:46:50,291 --> 00:46:54,730
distant observer can never see the
signal from app or inside the horizon.

729
00:46:55,270 --> 00:46:58,540
So that's, that's the way I try to
balance the two answers that, that yes,

730
00:46:58,541 --> 00:46:59,374
it happens,

731
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:02,980
but you can never actually see the
signal from the black hole because that's

732
00:47:02,981 --> 00:47:03,814
what a black hole is.

733
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:13,150
Hi. So you started with an
explanation of how time dilation, uh,

734
00:47:13,151 --> 00:47:16,470
it depends more on acceleration than
the actual philosophy of the Observer.

735
00:47:16,770 --> 00:47:19,650
But then when you got into the
Pythagorean theorem explanation,

736
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:20,940
that made perfect sense to me.

737
00:47:20,941 --> 00:47:23,830
If we were just thinking about
velocity and ignoring acceleration, I,

738
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:27,360
I got a little confused about which
way I should be thinking in terms of

739
00:47:27,630 --> 00:47:29,980
changing velocity or a constant
velocity and how that affects

740
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:34,540
the dilation. Yeah. The reason
for this is that it feels,

741
00:47:35,230 --> 00:47:40,230
it feels more valid to compare
clocks at the same place.

742
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:45,460
So if I ran across the stage and
it's not my clock over there,

743
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:47,560
I could manage it with constant velocity,

744
00:47:47,770 --> 00:47:52,750
but then you might doubt that my notion
of time over there was the same as the

745
00:47:52,751 --> 00:47:53,584
one over here.

746
00:47:54,070 --> 00:47:58,470
And so that's why I felt obliged to go
there and then come back a couple of

747
00:47:58,471 --> 00:47:59,650
times to,

748
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:03,070
to illustrate that there is something
real going on here and that necessitates

749
00:48:03,071 --> 00:48:04,610
the acceleration.
Um,

750
00:48:04,930 --> 00:48:09,130
but when we get to this business
of actually deriving the formula,

751
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:13,060
then it's a heck of a lot simpler,
simpler to idealize and say, look,

752
00:48:13,061 --> 00:48:15,190
this consider a perfectly
straight velocity.

753
00:48:15,370 --> 00:48:19,960
What I could've done to bridge the gap
between the two is I could have said when

754
00:48:19,961 --> 00:48:21,100
I get across the room,

755
00:48:21,460 --> 00:48:26,460
then I turned back instantaneously
and then I would have a perfectly,

756
00:48:26,530 --> 00:48:29,320
my photon will go down like this,
like I showed,

757
00:48:29,470 --> 00:48:31,720
and then it would just go right back up.

758
00:48:32,470 --> 00:48:35,560
So I could manage it at the
cost of infinite acceleration.

759
00:48:35,590 --> 00:48:39,880
And then my geometry would
have been perfectly correct
and I would still be able

760
00:48:39,881 --> 00:48:42,370
to measure at the time,
but at the same point.

761
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:47,560
Yep.
Um,

762
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:50,433
so

763
00:48:52,570 --> 00:48:56,800
when we look at like atomic theory and
what Einstein and like Oppenheimer and

764
00:48:56,801 --> 00:48:57,660
guys were doing with

765
00:48:58,590 --> 00:48:59,423
mmm.

766
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:00,620
Like atomics,
right?

767
00:49:01,160 --> 00:49:05,720
We did something with that either creating
the bomb or creating nuclear fusion

768
00:49:05,721 --> 00:49:06,554
reactors.

769
00:49:06,830 --> 00:49:10,700
You're talking about quantum mechanics
and even Google's exploring using that

770
00:49:10,701 --> 00:49:15,110
for computation from an application
and exploitation perspective.

771
00:49:15,111 --> 00:49:19,220
Has there been research into like what
we might do with this as a species or

772
00:49:19,410 --> 00:49:22,880
something like that?
Does that question make sense?

773
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:29,170
The GPS answer? Yeah, you
did. You mean with uh,

774
00:49:29,330 --> 00:49:33,940
black holes or with, with Caden
relativity or gravitational waves? Yeah,

775
00:49:33,980 --> 00:49:34,910
gps is a good end.

776
00:49:34,950 --> 00:49:36,940
Sure. Yeah. So, so, you know,

777
00:49:37,110 --> 00:49:42,110
gravitational positioning satellites are
way up there and I'm in elevation and

778
00:49:46,350 --> 00:49:51,350
so high above the earth that
the gravitational redshift
who fact matter and in

779
00:49:52,681 --> 00:49:57,420
order to make gps work as well
as it does to within a few feet,

780
00:49:58,050 --> 00:50:02,970
you have to have timing. And those
satellites figured out really well too.

781
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:07,440
I guess it's about the few
nanosecond level. Um, so,

782
00:50:07,620 --> 00:50:09,990
and that's done with atomic
clocks by the way. Um,

783
00:50:10,380 --> 00:50:15,380
but it was also done by understanding
this fortunate metric on now as for a

784
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:21,630
while, as for really practical
applications of black holes per se.

785
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:23,910
Well, maybe you should tell
him about the Penrose process

786
00:50:25,830 --> 00:50:28,220
[inaudible] that if we did

787
00:50:28,220 --> 00:50:31,010
happen to have a black hole
but came wandering nearby

788
00:50:32,690 --> 00:50:37,640
and didn't sort of run into us, um, in
principle we could go, if it was rotating,

789
00:50:37,970 --> 00:50:41,600
we could go to that black hole and
mine it for rotational energy. Um,

790
00:50:41,690 --> 00:50:45,380
and in something that's probably one of
the most efficient forms of energy that

791
00:50:45,381 --> 00:50:47,200
we could get.
Um,

792
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:52,130
if you'd think like nuclear fusion,
um,

793
00:50:52,460 --> 00:50:55,250
if you think it was like the rest Mesic
Wilson of energy that you get from that,

794
00:50:55,251 --> 00:50:58,880
that's less than a percent or it's like
a fraction of a percent. In theory,

795
00:50:58,881 --> 00:51:01,010
if you had a very rapidly
rotating black hole,

796
00:51:01,340 --> 00:51:06,340
you could get upwards of almost 30%
of its rest mass equivalent in energy

797
00:51:06,621 --> 00:51:08,420
extracted from it. So, for example,

798
00:51:08,421 --> 00:51:10,490
you'd be formed the black
or the mass of the sun,

799
00:51:10,790 --> 00:51:15,290
there'd be a whole Solo Sun's worth
equals MC squared of energy in that black

800
00:51:15,291 --> 00:51:19,640
hole. If it's rapid, the rotating
about 30% of that can be extracted. Um,

801
00:51:19,940 --> 00:51:23,810
so I'm taking a third of the Sun Equals
Mc squared and converting it to energy.

802
00:51:24,260 --> 00:51:28,280
Um, but yeah, that that will require
us finding one of these black holes.

803
00:51:28,281 --> 00:51:29,210
And I mean they'd been,

804
00:51:29,670 --> 00:51:34,070
I was a science fiction and even Freeman
Dyson had sort of imagined advanced

805
00:51:34,071 --> 00:51:36,650
civilizations powering
themselves using back hauls.

806
00:51:39,310 --> 00:51:40,143
Yeah.

807
00:51:45,510 --> 00:51:49,780
So I have a kind of a
weird question. Um, we,

808
00:51:49,820 --> 00:51:52,960
we were billions of light years away from
this collision when it happened and so

809
00:51:52,961 --> 00:51:56,240
we detected it with this
exquisite detector. Um,

810
00:51:56,610 --> 00:52:00,240
presumably if you were closer to
it, I mean, if you were like hosted,

811
00:52:00,250 --> 00:52:03,690
what you'd be destroyed by this
enormous energetic event. I,

812
00:52:03,810 --> 00:52:07,320
but there must be at some
distance where you would feel it.

813
00:52:07,890 --> 00:52:09,180
What would it feel like?

814
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:13,500
That's a good gracious.
All right. I can imagine

815
00:52:15,990 --> 00:52:20,900
you're going to be straight being
stretched and squeezed and let,

816
00:52:20,910 --> 00:52:25,560
let's say if you're about a hundred times
a swatch or radius on this thing away.

817
00:52:25,561 --> 00:52:29,350
So for this event, say you were
at about 10 kilometers away, um,

818
00:52:29,730 --> 00:52:31,080
then the amplitude,

819
00:52:31,230 --> 00:52:34,560
the fractional change is going to be
something like 10 to the minus three.

820
00:52:34,561 --> 00:52:38,460
So you might be stretched and squeezed
by a few millimeters. So that's actually,

821
00:52:38,461 --> 00:52:41,100
I think you mean you feel
it the few millimeters,

822
00:52:41,101 --> 00:52:43,140
like over the length of
your bodies and too bad.

823
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:46,860
The thing where I'm a bit more concerned
about is a frequency is very high.

824
00:52:46,861 --> 00:52:50,310
So this thing that I could add a hundred
hertz being stretched and squeezed it a

825
00:52:50,310 --> 00:52:54,690
hundred hertz, that might mess up with
some things, but not for example. I mean,

826
00:52:54,750 --> 00:52:57,750
you probably hear it like it will,
it will affect your eardrums.

827
00:52:57,810 --> 00:53:00,290
There'll be stretch and
squeeze. So they'll probably
be a thing. But I mean you'd,

828
00:53:00,300 --> 00:53:05,250
you'd feel it. It feels this
very rapid vibration. Um, yeah.

829
00:53:05,251 --> 00:53:09,300
But the idea, you have to get very,
very, very close to it. Thanks.

830
00:53:10,780 --> 00:53:13,850
I my questions about the
detection of gravitational waves.

831
00:53:14,120 --> 00:53:18,020
It seems like if you kind of
rotated the instrument like 45,

832
00:53:18,050 --> 00:53:21,890
if you had it originally at the ideal
angle and then you rotated 45 degrees,

833
00:53:21,891 --> 00:53:25,530
you wouldn't see it at all. Maybe.
And also you were saying it like,

834
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:27,930
like the time was very short,

835
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:31,650
like if the machine had
turned off for a millisecond,

836
00:53:31,651 --> 00:53:33,090
would you have just totally missed it?

837
00:53:33,091 --> 00:53:36,570
And how frequently to two
rotating black holes collide?

838
00:53:37,050 --> 00:53:41,400
I guess like how lucky were they that
they saw it or was it pretty likely that

839
00:53:41,430 --> 00:53:42,420
they would see something?

840
00:53:44,170 --> 00:53:46,510
I think it was quite like,
like one thing is we,

841
00:53:46,570 --> 00:53:50,010
we didn't know how frequently these
black holes merge. This could happen.

842
00:53:50,011 --> 00:53:52,620
And it was actually a lot of
doubts in the community had like,

843
00:53:52,621 --> 00:53:55,740
it would actually work. So there, there's
a whole story about that that goes,

844
00:53:55,741 --> 00:53:58,600
you know, it goes back
decades. Um, but you're right.

845
00:53:58,601 --> 00:54:01,710
But if it had hadn't been on at that time,
we would have missed it.

846
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:06,560
And presumably these things are
happening. Um, pre, you know,

847
00:54:06,570 --> 00:54:09,390
galaxy the size of the milky
way once every million years.

848
00:54:09,780 --> 00:54:13,200
And so that's why Lygo has to be
sensitive enough to, at least in its,

849
00:54:13,290 --> 00:54:16,200
in its range sweep up at least
about a million galaxies.

850
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:19,020
So we have a chance of seeing
like one per year, but those,

851
00:54:19,021 --> 00:54:20,190
those rates are uncertain.

852
00:54:20,191 --> 00:54:23,370
But you can imagine it was like hundreds
of billions of galaxies in the universe.

853
00:54:23,371 --> 00:54:24,204
So every,

854
00:54:24,300 --> 00:54:28,410
every day there's several dozen or several
hundreds of these mergers happening

855
00:54:28,411 --> 00:54:31,860
somewhere in the universe and the
waves come, they cross you earth very,

856
00:54:31,861 --> 00:54:36,290
very rapidly. So yeah, if, if I go
isn't on winter, winter passes, we've,

857
00:54:36,291 --> 00:54:39,440
we've missed it. So I
think, you know, the, the,

858
00:54:39,570 --> 00:54:41,190
I think we were still running at the time.
I mean,

859
00:54:41,191 --> 00:54:44,390
I can take and talk about this for a
lot if he'd worries, but they're there.

860
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:48,540
It's a lot of things about this
event that was very fortunate.

861
00:54:48,541 --> 00:54:51,120
The way that they're fed just
turned the instruments on.

862
00:54:51,121 --> 00:54:54,190
They actually didn't think they
were ready for a science run. Um,

863
00:54:54,780 --> 00:54:57,020
they didn't because of that.
They didn't fail.

864
00:54:57,021 --> 00:54:59,910
It took him a long time to understand
that it really was a signal.

865
00:54:59,911 --> 00:55:03,180
Someone thought they were playing a joke
or hacking the system and it took them

866
00:55:03,181 --> 00:55:05,670
a long time to convince themselves and,
and this was a real signal.

867
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:07,380
And then just nature of being lucky,

868
00:55:07,650 --> 00:55:10,050
like we actually didn't
expect such heavy black holes.

869
00:55:10,710 --> 00:55:12,060
We had no idea about the rates.

870
00:55:12,060 --> 00:55:15,810
So there was a lot of like both from
nature and the way they experiment work.

871
00:55:16,770 --> 00:55:21,600
So a quick answer to this business
of being insensitive to the other

872
00:55:21,601 --> 00:55:22,111
polarization.

873
00:55:22,111 --> 00:55:26,370
You're quite right that if you've got
only the cross polarization when you are

874
00:55:26,371 --> 00:55:28,500
ready for plus,
then you wouldn't see it.

875
00:55:29,100 --> 00:55:33,720
Each detector in Ligo is sensitive
to only one polarization. However,

876
00:55:34,320 --> 00:55:38,700
the signals that we can imagine
have a mix of both polarization,

877
00:55:39,210 --> 00:55:43,190
both polarizations present and, and
so you're going to see it, right?

878
00:55:43,420 --> 00:55:44,820
That's not a problem, right? So yes,

879
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:47,490
the intensity is going to
depend on the orientation,

880
00:55:47,491 --> 00:55:49,810
but you won't miss it completely
because of that. Yeah.

881
00:55:50,830 --> 00:55:52,150
So a question on that,
right?

882
00:55:52,180 --> 00:55:55,960
How do we know these are actually like
black holes of binary black hole system?

883
00:55:55,961 --> 00:56:00,170
And not like, you know, dilation
of spacetime eater, like

884
00:56:01,700 --> 00:56:03,760
no other explanation,
right?

885
00:56:03,990 --> 00:56:07,330
It's because of the very particular
shape of the wave form that there's this

886
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:12,520
what steeple? The CHIRP, right? So that
increases in amplitude reaches a maximum.

887
00:56:12,521 --> 00:56:16,810
And then the case that the exact shape
is very characteristic of black holes.

888
00:56:17,230 --> 00:56:19,780
So the, yeah, if you want to play
devil's advocate, you can say, well,

889
00:56:19,810 --> 00:56:24,050
is there something else in the universe
that might produce this? And well,

890
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:25,960
so far we don't know.
Um,

891
00:56:26,030 --> 00:56:29,200
I'd say that there's nothing that we
know of that could produce a signal like

892
00:56:29,201 --> 00:56:33,130
that. Another, another side of the
question is, is it, could it be noise?

893
00:56:33,131 --> 00:56:35,740
Because you know, these things,
they measuring distances,

894
00:56:36,010 --> 00:56:38,980
they incredibly sensitive.
Um, so I mean, they, they,

895
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:43,510
they can detect the tiniest earthquakes
that happen anywhere in the world.

896
00:56:43,950 --> 00:56:44,783
Um,

897
00:56:45,010 --> 00:56:49,040
one example that they can detect just
regular waves crashing on the ocean,

898
00:56:49,360 --> 00:56:52,600
on the oceans around the United States
is incredibly sensitive instrument.

899
00:56:52,780 --> 00:56:57,580
So you have to also make sure that that
noise wasn't responsible for that. Um,

900
00:56:57,790 --> 00:57:02,740
and that is any, that's why they actually
are two detectors. One in, uh, Hanford,

901
00:57:02,741 --> 00:57:06,640
Washington state, one in Louisiana,
separated by a few thousand kilometers.

902
00:57:06,641 --> 00:57:08,000
And so one reason,
well,

903
00:57:08,010 --> 00:57:12,640
one way that they can vet for noise
sources is they have to see the same thing

904
00:57:12,790 --> 00:57:17,500
separated by it. Most delight crossing
time. So you know, the, the, the, if the,

905
00:57:17,560 --> 00:57:19,840
if the gravitational waves that
happen at a certain orientation,

906
00:57:19,841 --> 00:57:21,280
they'll see it instantaneously.

907
00:57:21,670 --> 00:57:25,960
The maximum time difference could be
for first hits one and then travels and

908
00:57:25,961 --> 00:57:29,920
hits the other one. So the time that
light, so I think 10 milliseconds or so.

909
00:57:30,580 --> 00:57:33,910
So it would be at some, some very
good questions. And that these, this

910
00:57:35,530 --> 00:57:37,510
too, there's, this looks
exactly like what we,

911
00:57:37,810 --> 00:57:40,810
where we solve the Einstein equations
for backup emerges as it looks exactly

912
00:57:40,811 --> 00:57:43,420
like a black hole merger that they,
yeah,

913
00:57:43,510 --> 00:57:48,400
those are things that need
to be considered. Cool. Thank
you. We are out of time.

914
00:57:48,430 --> 00:57:49,263
So let me

915
00:57:50,290 --> 00:57:54,580
[inaudible].
