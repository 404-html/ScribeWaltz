1
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:15,130
Okay. Thanks very much for
inviting me here. Um, I'll, uh,

2
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:20,650
I've kind of organize my
talk into different bits.

3
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:25,210
So I'll go through the sections,
me and my project, some history,

4
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:29,620
the events from September the
14th to February 11th. Um,

5
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:31,390
the event in its reception,
you know,

6
00:00:31,391 --> 00:00:33,520
this is in the discovery
of gravitational waves.

7
00:00:33,521 --> 00:00:38,521
The first confirmed detection of
gravitational waves announced at a press

8
00:00:39,071 --> 00:00:41,170
conference on February the 11th,

9
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:46,380
2016 but the actual event was seen on
September the 15th 2015 and a few more

10
00:00:50,891 --> 00:00:51,724
things at the end,

11
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:55,540
which are some of which you might be quite
interesting and I'll head each of the

12
00:00:55,541 --> 00:00:57,760
sections with this.
So we'll see how we're getting along.

13
00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:02,140
I'll try and talk for about 30 minutes
and leave plenty of time for questions

14
00:01:02,141 --> 00:01:05,530
and answers because they
usually all various questions.

15
00:01:05,531 --> 00:01:08,580
So let's start with me and my project.
Um,

16
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:14,260
it's actually, I've been doing this
for a sick kid. He's the 45th year,

17
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:18,190
not 30th year at least I started in 1972.

18
00:01:18,490 --> 00:01:23,490
Those were the first interviews I
conducted on what was then the controversy

19
00:01:23,591 --> 00:01:26,410
over gravitation of waves.
Talk a bit there.

20
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:30,370
I took a bit more about that in a moment.
And these are the, some of the books.

21
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:34,810
Gravity's shadow, which is a very thick
book. It's about over 800 pages long,

22
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:39,280
nearly 900 pages, um, which
was published in 2004.

23
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:43,450
My advice is not to buy it
because once you start reading it,

24
00:01:43,451 --> 00:01:46,570
you'll never put it down and it
will waste a lot of your time.

25
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:52,200
And the second that that book gravity's
goal is actually two books in one.

26
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,450
Once one book is called gravity's goes to,

27
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:58,150
which was originally published
separately by itself.

28
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:02,050
And then the second
book was called Big Dog.

29
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:06,010
And I persuaded the publisher has to
include gravity's ghost in the publication

30
00:02:06,011 --> 00:02:09,700
of big dog. So this book is the
paperback version of gravities ghost,

31
00:02:09,701 --> 00:02:11,920
as well as being the
paperback version of big dog.

32
00:02:11,921 --> 00:02:14,350
There was never a hardback version of it.

33
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:19,560
And what that book describes is
to so-called blind injections,

34
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:25,290
which is what this is when the big
interfere a metric gravitational wave

35
00:02:25,601 --> 00:02:26,920
detectors were in business.

36
00:02:26,921 --> 00:02:31,921
I'll explain that in a moment and what
the scientists did was get a small group,

37
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:36,730
two or three people to inject
into the interferometers.

38
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:38,610
A signal worked,

39
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:43,640
looked like a gravitational wave and keep
it secret so that the whole community

40
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:49,110
had to investigate this signal not knowing
whether it is a real signal or a fake

41
00:02:50,531 --> 00:02:55,330
signal. So they were rehearsing
for the detection of a real signal,

42
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:58,540
not knowing whether they were already
looking at a real signal to make it as

43
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:00,160
valued as possible.

44
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:04,060
One of the things that the book talks
about a lot is whether these blind

45
00:03:04,061 --> 00:03:09,061
injections were really mimicking a real
detection of gravitational waves because

46
00:03:10,091 --> 00:03:13,030
now we had the real detection of
gravitational, where's the book?

47
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:19,030
This book is a real time account from

48
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:25,590
the evening of September the 15th night
2015 when I was first read the email

49
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:32,350
that said, interesting event
has happened to you know,

50
00:03:32,351 --> 00:03:35,050
for about six months until
the thing was out in public.

51
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:39,250
And then it goes on about the
reception of it in public and so forth.

52
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:43,750
It's all written in real time
or mostly real time. Anyway,

53
00:03:43,751 --> 00:03:48,580
I didn't start writing it until the
event happened on a Monday and I didn't

54
00:03:48,581 --> 00:03:53,581
start writing the book and
tell the Thursday because
I assumed it wasn't a real

55
00:03:53,771 --> 00:03:56,530
event, just like every, all the other
scientists did as well. You know,

56
00:03:56,531 --> 00:03:59,410
they thought there's another bit of noise.
Uh,

57
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:04,210
but then it grew rapidly in
credibility over about two days.

58
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:08,080
And then I realized, Hey, this is
something interesting going on here.

59
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:12,850
And I started to write on the
Thursday, um, have just having

60
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:18,170
collected the emails up till then.

61
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:21,310
It was obviously interesting
from the word go to collect,

62
00:04:21,311 --> 00:04:24,970
be worth collecting emails, which
I did incidentally, just so you,

63
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:26,500
I'll tell you how I wrote this book.
I mean,

64
00:04:26,501 --> 00:04:29,350
I've been at this for
donkey's years as you see.

65
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:35,010
And my method is mostly to initially
to interview the scientists.

66
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:40,870
I went in 1972 I drove across America
and I'll call talking to all the

67
00:04:40,871 --> 00:04:45,780
scientists are involving gravitational
wave detection. And then from the, uh,

68
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,190
mid nineties to the mid two thousands,

69
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:52,300
I went to every single gravitational wave
conference that took place around the

70
00:04:52,301 --> 00:04:56,800
world and got to know the gravitational
wave scientists really well.

71
00:04:57,370 --> 00:04:58,720
Uh,
I mean,

72
00:04:58,721 --> 00:05:03,160
one of the very senior people and we
were staying with us for the weekend just

73
00:05:03,161 --> 00:05:07,630
last weekend actually because
we've become friends and uh,

74
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:13,480
then, uh, but, and so I did
an awful lot of traveling,

75
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:15,430
use an awful lot of air miles,

76
00:05:15,431 --> 00:05:18,580
enough air miles to travel business
class wherever I went for about 10 years

77
00:05:18,581 --> 00:05:22,960
because I had always air miles, can't
do it anymore unfortunately. Um,

78
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:25,900
and uh,
so I was going to maybe six,

79
00:05:25,901 --> 00:05:30,250
seven international meetings
a year across the world. Uh,

80
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:35,280
but this event I assumed was going to
involve me in a hell of a lot of airplane

81
00:05:35,741 --> 00:05:39,250
travel, but it didn't because the
whole thing happened over email.

82
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:43,120
Email's a few telecoms,
few telephone calls.

83
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:46,180
Obviously people were talking to
each other and their local groups.

84
00:05:46,181 --> 00:05:48,250
Remember this is a group of,
uh,

85
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:52,990
1200 people scattered around the world
and they did not at any time during the

86
00:05:52,991 --> 00:05:55,750
course of this discovery
meet together in one place.

87
00:05:56,010 --> 00:05:57,860
They did it all by email and by telecom.

88
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:01,790
And I was just sitting in the middle
of this web of emails and telecoms

89
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,080
collecting them. Um, the,

90
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:09,200
the question is why on Earth,
why me?

91
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:11,660
You want to know if you want to know
something about the detection of

92
00:06:11,661 --> 00:06:15,170
gravitational waves,
why have you invited a sociologist?

93
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:18,140
I'm a sociologist, for
heaven's sake. Okay.

94
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:21,500
And this is a fairly
serious question for me to,

95
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:26,150
am I capable of writing about the
detection of gravitational waves?

96
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:29,750
And the answer is yes. Uh, and,

97
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:34,870
but I'm going to justify this a
little bit more than I might normally,

98
00:06:35,781 --> 00:06:38,570
let me say one justification
is that when I write stuff,

99
00:06:38,571 --> 00:06:41,090
I send it to the gravitation
of warf physicists and say,

100
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:44,540
read this and tell me if
there's anything wrong with it.

101
00:06:44,541 --> 00:06:48,020
And I've never had any serious problems.
Well, you know, we have a few options.

102
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:51,050
You know, you're saying that about
us, Harry, that's not true. And I say,

103
00:06:51,051 --> 00:06:55,370
well I think it is true
and we argue backwards and
forwards and generally when I

104
00:06:55,371 --> 00:06:57,050
have a serious conversation like that,

105
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,380
I'll alter maybe half of what I've,

106
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:03,740
half of the points that they object to
and leave. The other half is I wear.

107
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:05,540
That's the kind of way it goes.

108
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:09,800
But I'm going to talk a little bit more
about why it is that I am capable of

109
00:07:09,801 --> 00:07:14,801
writing this book because I think one
of the tests I did his particular of

110
00:07:15,261 --> 00:07:18,980
particular interest to you guys.
Uh,

111
00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:23,150
and there you are.
There's a piece in nature.

112
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:27,430
Sociologists Falls, physics judges,
that's me under sociologist.

113
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:31,520
And uh,
I did it by playing imitation games,

114
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:34,340
which of course are the
forerunners of the cheering test.

115
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:40,300
So I thought you might be slightly
interested in these and what this nature

116
00:07:40,401 --> 00:07:45,401
article is reporting is
something we did in 2005 strokes.

117
00:07:45,521 --> 00:07:49,010
Six where I got a gravitation away,

118
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:53,810
physicist from my university
departments in Cardiff,

119
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:57,020
Cardiff is by coincidence.
I shouldn't by complete coincidence,

120
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,720
quite a big place for
gravitational wave physics.

121
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:04,250
So I've got one of the guys from
their professor from there to ask some

122
00:08:04,251 --> 00:08:09,020
questions of me and to
gravitation wave physicist.

123
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:14,060
And then we had three dialogues.
You know me the question there,

124
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:19,250
the answer from respondent, either
the answer from respondent be there.

125
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:23,180
This was sent to nine other
gravitational wave physicists.

126
00:08:23,181 --> 00:08:26,990
They were technical questions and the
nine other gravitational wave physicists

127
00:08:26,991 --> 00:08:30,140
was or asked which one's the
real gravitation wave physicist.

128
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,410
We've done a lot in Cardiff.
We,

129
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:35,750
me and my group has done
a lot more invitation game
since since then and we got

130
00:08:35,751 --> 00:08:40,050
to and very nice two and a quarter
million European Research Council advance

131
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:42,620
grant to use a mutation
games as a new suit,

132
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:46,410
social science method and we're just
writing a book about invitation came

133
00:08:46,411 --> 00:08:50,270
through MIT press. Uh, and then
we repeated this experiment.

134
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:54,560
Those are the questions.
I'm just sorry we repeated experiments.

135
00:08:54,561 --> 00:08:59,160
These are the for some much more recent
versions of it in 2016 if you want to

136
00:08:59,161 --> 00:09:00,120
know what the questions were like,

137
00:09:00,121 --> 00:09:04,080
I've given you the 2016 questions
doubles to read through all those eight

138
00:09:04,081 --> 00:09:04,561
questions.

139
00:09:04,561 --> 00:09:09,561
Just pick one or two at random so you get
a sense of the nature of the questions

140
00:09:11,071 --> 00:09:14,490
being asked. This wasn't
trivial stuff. Okay.

141
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:19,550
This was quite a reasonably hard to sang
professor of physics at Cardiff asked

142
00:09:20,241 --> 00:09:21,074
those questions.

143
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:26,763
Okay,

144
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:33,760
okay. And here's the
results of that test. So,

145
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:36,700
uh,
on the left hand side of the table,

146
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:40,900
you see that the question is we,
this time we elaborated,

147
00:09:40,901 --> 00:09:44,890
we've got not just me but other people
to answer the questions as not just me

148
00:09:44,891 --> 00:09:46,240
and a gravitational wave physicist.

149
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:49,300
We've got three gravitation away
physicists to answer the questions.

150
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:54,610
We got what I call three savvy
physicists to answer the questions.

151
00:09:54,611 --> 00:09:59,611
Now savvy physicists are astro physicist
working in the same department,

152
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:03,340
Cardiff Department as the
gravitational wave physicists.

153
00:10:03,341 --> 00:10:07,420
So they knew a lot about gravitational
waves from working in the same department

154
00:10:07,421 --> 00:10:11,560
as well as being astrophysicists
themselves to savvy social scientists.

155
00:10:11,561 --> 00:10:16,561
And savvy social scientists are people
like my junior colleagues at Cardiff who

156
00:10:17,321 --> 00:10:21,460
have to read everything I ever write
and listen to me talking, you know,

157
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:23,920
enormous length about
gravitational wave physics.

158
00:10:23,921 --> 00:10:25,660
So they know quite a bit about it as well.

159
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:31,260
And me how Rick Collins and then on the
right we got going across the top you

160
00:10:31,661 --> 00:10:33,670
see the people who mark to the answers,

161
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:37,580
people who mark the answers where another
four gravitation wave physicist for

162
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,000
different ones entirely.
Okay.

163
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:44,960
The two sound the same to
savvy social scientists. Um,

164
00:10:45,530 --> 00:10:48,180
you may,
you may have already struck me,

165
00:10:48,181 --> 00:10:51,670
there's a problem here because the
people marking their own answers,

166
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:55,450
but actually it was in much of it is
less of a problem than you think because

167
00:10:55,451 --> 00:10:59,620
the marketing was done a long time
after the questions were being asked and

168
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:04,210
there's 72 randomly ordered questions and
it's not actually so easy to recognize

169
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:08,260
which question you've answered. So it's
a little bit messy but it's not too bad.

170
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:12,990
Okay. To ordinary social scientists who
knew nothing about gravitation away,

171
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:18,010
physicist especially cause they
weren't under my control and me myself.

172
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:22,660
So the first thing to look down is the
left hand column and you'll see the way

173
00:11:22,661 --> 00:11:26,310
the, for gravitational wave physicists,
you could get a maximum of 32 points.

174
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,210
Then if you answered every question right.

175
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:33,070
And I got the grant other than the three
other gravitational wave because it has

176
00:11:33,071 --> 00:11:37,420
got an average of 27 points and
I got 25 points, which isn't bad.

177
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:40,150
Whereas the non gravitational
wave physicists,

178
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:44,470
crucially including the savvy physicists
who didn't know anything about

179
00:11:44,471 --> 00:11:47,380
gravitational waves,
got considerably less points.

180
00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:51,910
And there's an interesting lesson in
this very little small experiment,

181
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:54,580
which is the,
is that like crevasses?

182
00:11:55,060 --> 00:12:00,060
They're very narrow and deep and it's
not the case that if you're a scientist

183
00:12:01,001 --> 00:12:01,870
and a white coat,

184
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:07,170
you can go up and pronounce
or authoritatively on any
similar subject as close

185
00:12:08,201 --> 00:12:09,034
to yours.

186
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:13,990
And this little tiny experiment shows it
and even a snotty nose sociologist like

187
00:12:13,991 --> 00:12:17,260
me can do better in
answering those questions.

188
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:22,510
Then a physicist who's been spent a lot
of time near to other gravitational wave

189
00:12:22,511 --> 00:12:25,090
physicist, well, there's
more in that table.

190
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,490
We can come back to it in the
question session if you want,

191
00:12:27,491 --> 00:12:31,630
but I don't want to spend a whole
lecture on that. So some history of this,

192
00:12:31,631 --> 00:12:34,480
the first person to have tried
to detect gravitational waves,

193
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:39,510
Einstein invented or worked out that
these were a consequence of the theory of

194
00:12:39,611 --> 00:12:43,090
relativity in the early 20th century.

195
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:47,380
He worked out what the,
kind of, not the wave form,

196
00:12:47,381 --> 00:12:52,240
but some of their properties
when he worked out the
general theory of relativity

197
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:57,040
in 1915, uh, the detection,
which was in 2015,

198
00:12:57,041 --> 00:13:01,210
was miraculously just a hundred years
after Einstein had come up with a detailed

199
00:13:01,211 --> 00:13:05,950
idea, uh, but the first person to
try and detect them with Joe Weber,

200
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:10,290
this guy here shown here who started
to try and detect them in the,

201
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:14,080
in the early sixties
with a device like this,

202
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,150
that thing he's working on is a

203
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:22,990
cylinder of Allah minium wiring, a ton
and a hall for a couple of tons suspended,

204
00:13:22,991 --> 00:13:24,760
insulated in a vacuum tube.

205
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:28,360
It has PSE electric crystals
glue to its surface,

206
00:13:28,361 --> 00:13:32,290
which will sense any
slight vibration in the,

207
00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:37,330
uh, in the cylinder. And the trick
is to have two of these cylinders,

208
00:13:37,331 --> 00:13:42,331
a couple of thousand miles apart and look
for coincident excitations in the two

209
00:13:42,521 --> 00:13:46,570
cylinders. And what you say as
if this happens, if the, if,

210
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:51,600
if you've eliminated all sources of
vibration and the cylinders you call them,

211
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:57,870
they were always juggling a bell from
Brownian motion and residual vibrations

212
00:13:58,451 --> 00:13:59,590
coming up through the earth.

213
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:04,620
You hadn't quite managed to damp out and
residual 60 mains frequency and things

214
00:14:05,771 --> 00:14:07,510
like that.
It's coming through the electrical system.

215
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:12,630
But if you can eliminate most of that
stuff and then you see couple of big

216
00:14:12,821 --> 00:14:17,821
excursions happening at exactly the
same time or to be more exact within the

217
00:14:20,081 --> 00:14:24,600
light travel time between the two, 2000
miles on our detectors. Okay. You can,

218
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:28,300
you say, well I, I can't think
what could have caused this.

219
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:32,590
So we'll call that gravitation
waves. Okay. Well you,

220
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:34,710
you can think of some things
that could have caused it.

221
00:14:34,711 --> 00:14:38,730
If you get a lightening strike
somewhere in between the two detectors,

222
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:40,660
well they could cause it.
And the other thing that,

223
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:44,830
the sort of thing that people used to
worry about is what if this happens on

224
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:50,040
Monday night in America when everybody's
watching Monday night football and at

225
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:56,060
the interval low got up and switch a
kettle kettles on that's going to send a

226
00:14:56,510 --> 00:14:59,540
pulse through the grid at exactly
the same time and that could fall.

227
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:01,010
You might think that's a gravity wave,

228
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:04,190
but so you wipe out all that sort of stuff
and you try and measure all that sort

229
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:09,110
of stuff and you try and
get to a gravitational wave.

230
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:14,220
Um, that's a schematic of
Joe's Webber's designed,

231
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:15,780
um,
uh,

232
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:20,270
another half dozen people tried to
repeat Joe Webb as findings pretty well

233
00:15:20,271 --> 00:15:22,310
completely.
They didn't confirm it.

234
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:26,180
And that's when I come in in 1972
going around interviewing both lots of

235
00:15:26,181 --> 00:15:29,690
scientists and trying to work out how
they argue with each other and how they

236
00:15:29,691 --> 00:15:34,610
come to a conclusion. That
was my earliest work. Um,

237
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:38,270
and uh, yeah, let's, let's see
that, so with that technology,

238
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:40,160
which was improved,

239
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:45,430
the next generation of these resonant
bars was cooled down to near absolute

240
00:15:45,741 --> 00:15:48,820
zero. Uh, they're quite
difficult, but let's,

241
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:52,040
it says Joe weapons operators must've
cost a few tens of thousands of dollars,

242
00:15:52,041 --> 00:15:55,310
and then you're getting into the
hundreds of thousands of dollars with a

243
00:15:55,311 --> 00:15:59,520
cryogenically cooled bars,
a big sentence of this virtually,

244
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:02,060
uh,
as well as the United States.

245
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:07,340
And over the period up to
the early two thousands,

246
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:12,341
about half a thousand claims were made
to have detected gravitational waves with

247
00:16:12,651 --> 00:16:13,760
this technology,

248
00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:18,710
but they were all shut down eventually
by the scientific community.

249
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:23,060
That's an important piece of context
to the discovery when it did happen,

250
00:16:23,061 --> 00:16:26,480
because you've got to realize that when
these people were thinking they were

251
00:16:26,481 --> 00:16:31,481
seeing a gravitational wave in 2015 this
was against a background of nearly 50

252
00:16:32,271 --> 00:16:37,070
years of shooting down every single claim
that had ever been made to have seen a

253
00:16:37,071 --> 00:16:37,970
gravitational wave.

254
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:42,560
And there was a lot of paranoia
about and a lot of enmity about,

255
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:46,040
because the rest of the physics community
generally felt that their money was

256
00:16:46,041 --> 00:16:49,790
being wasted by these idiots trying
to detect gravitational waves.

257
00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:54,770
I should add that the should
have said this before,

258
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:59,780
the point about gravitational
waves, they're very, very,
very difficult to detect.

259
00:16:59,781 --> 00:17:03,920
So how are they produced?
They're produced by moving masses.

260
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:08,630
So just as electromagnetic waves
are produced by moving electrons.

261
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:13,960
My fist here is producing gravitational
ways cause I'm moving in about how much,

262
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:14,871
well,

263
00:17:14,871 --> 00:17:18,860
probably about a quantum of energy in
the lifetime of a couple of universities.

264
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:24,170
Uh, when Einstein worked out, the formula
for the emission of gravitational waves,

265
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:26,270
uh,

266
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:30,830
in the denominator was a
factor of the speed of light.

267
00:17:30,930 --> 00:17:35,660
The power for that just
gives you a sense of how,

268
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:40,760
uh, difficult to detect these things
are. We'll come back to that in a minute.

269
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:44,960
Um,
so half a dozen claims were made and the,

270
00:17:44,961 --> 00:17:48,950
and the point is that if Joe Weber
had been right and he'd really been,

271
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:54,020
didn't detecting gravitational
waves according to the theory,

272
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:57,390
either something very funny would've been,
must've been going on.

273
00:17:57,391 --> 00:18:00,300
Like there was a very local source,
which we couldn't see.

274
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:04,980
I mean really local predicting,
emitting the ways he was doing,

275
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:05,953
he was seeing,

276
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:08,460
but most people thought the way it ought
to be coming from the center of the

277
00:18:08,461 --> 00:18:11,360
galaxy if he was seeing them.
Um,

278
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:15,150
or either that or there's so much energy,

279
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:18,780
Jen energy was being produced in
gravitational radiation that the milky way

280
00:18:18,781 --> 00:18:22,290
should have been burning up before
our eyes and disappearing. Uh,

281
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:27,500
and people were upset by that idea and
so they didn't really want to accept code

282
00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:30,150
Joe Webb as findings nor any
of the subsequent findings.

283
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,790
So that's the early technology.

284
00:18:32,791 --> 00:18:37,791
Then the technology slowly and
gradually moved over to interferometry.

285
00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:40,523
Um,

286
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:45,270
an interferometer who doesn't know
what an interferometer his hands up,

287
00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:50,160
okay? An interferometer
is a device with two arms.

288
00:18:50,161 --> 00:18:54,120
There you can see the two arms,
okay? You go from a center station,

289
00:18:54,390 --> 00:18:56,580
you shine light down the two arms.

290
00:18:56,790 --> 00:18:59,670
The light is reflected back
for mirrors at the end.

291
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:04,470
And then the reflected light is combined
on a screen in the, in the middle.

292
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:09,150
And if you see that, if that
light is coherent, you will see,

293
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:13,860
um,
a pattern of light and dark.

294
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:17,880
So called fringes,
light and dark stripes on the screen.

295
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:19,283
Okay.

296
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:24,330
And the light and dark stripes are caused
by the interference of the two beams

297
00:19:24,331 --> 00:19:26,430
of light coming back
and meeting each other.

298
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:31,730
They're dark where trough and a peak
coincide and cancel each other out.

299
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:37,310
They're bright where two peaks or two
troughs coincide and double the effect.

300
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:39,480
So you get these light and dark troughs.

301
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:44,870
Now supposing you my new increased
the length of one of the arms,

302
00:19:46,170 --> 00:19:47,003
then

303
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:48,480
okay,

304
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:52,650
the position where the light light that
said the to the light and dark troughs

305
00:19:52,651 --> 00:19:54,630
we'll meet each other will
be slightly different.

306
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:59,640
So what you'll see is that that pattern
of fringes move slightly across the

307
00:19:59,641 --> 00:20:03,570
screen. And this is an
incredibly sensitive instrument.

308
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:05,570
Now I've built one of it.

309
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:10,530
I bet a lot of these actually myself
just to homemade one and you can do it.

310
00:20:10,531 --> 00:20:12,690
And I'm going to write another book
about gravitation and ways in which I'll

311
00:20:12,691 --> 00:20:17,490
give you instructions on how to do it.
Uh, but it's very, it's pretty easy. Um,

312
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:22,520
mine has arms about my typical one
has arms about eight inches long.

313
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:26,820
The source of light is a
laser pointer. Okay. Uh,

314
00:20:26,821 --> 00:20:30,300
the mirrors are just bits
of broken shaving, mirror.
Don't need anything fancy.

315
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,280
You need here a beam splitter,

316
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:37,140
which should be something
like a semi silvered mirror.

317
00:20:37,141 --> 00:20:39,120
But I've discovered any old bit of glass.
We'll do,

318
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,900
I just use a bit of glass out of
the picture frame for my care.

319
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:47,320
And you can produce interference fringes,
not nice,

320
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:51,070
neat lined up ones,
pretty rough ones.

321
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:56,440
But nevertheless you can
see they are interference,
fringes, light and dark, light,

322
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:59,230
dark pattern. And you can
test this out. So this,

323
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:03,910
this little interfere type
of interferometry liabilities
made out of a bit of

324
00:21:03,911 --> 00:21:07,270
chip board as a base. And if you've got
a cup of coffee and put it down on the,

325
00:21:07,690 --> 00:21:11,050
on the base somewhere near one
of where one of the beams is,

326
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:15,700
the wood will expand and you will see
the expansion of that word as a movement

327
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:18,850
of the light and dark patches.
And when you take the coffee back,

328
00:21:19,130 --> 00:21:22,660
pick your coffee, cup up, that expansion
will slowly go back again and you can,

329
00:21:22,661 --> 00:21:26,380
then you can put your Coffee Cup on
near the other beam and you will see the

330
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:31,210
movement of the fringes and in the other
direction and back again and so forth.

331
00:21:31,210 --> 00:21:35,290
So it's quite a nice fun instrument build.
Uh,

332
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:40,320
I just did that for myself to help myself
be more of a participant in the whole

333
00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:45,940
gravitational worth business though
I once took it to her, a physicist,

334
00:21:46,210 --> 00:21:48,190
a gravitational wave
physicist conference and said,

335
00:21:48,191 --> 00:21:50,820
what do you want to display this?
And they sneered at me

336
00:21:52,810 --> 00:21:56,590
because of course they're interferometer
is a somewhat more sensitive.

337
00:21:56,890 --> 00:22:01,890
The interferometer is used in the
detection instrument are the arms or four

338
00:22:02,801 --> 00:22:05,410
kilometers long.
Okay.

339
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:10,640
The lasers are extraordinarily powerful
and the light doesn't just bounced for

340
00:22:12,011 --> 00:22:14,430
kilometers and come back.
It bounces backwards and forwards.

341
00:22:14,431 --> 00:22:19,431
It's a hundred times before they recombine
it and so on and so on and so on and

342
00:22:19,841 --> 00:22:23,410
so on. And so on. These things
are, um, probably, I think, no,

343
00:22:23,411 --> 00:22:25,690
I don't say probably
they are the largest law,

344
00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:28,330
the most sensitive large scale
instruments that have ever been built.

345
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:31,360
It may be the most sensitive
instruments that have been built,

346
00:22:31,390 --> 00:22:34,750
but they're certainly the most sensitive
large scale instruments that have ever

347
00:22:34,751 --> 00:22:35,584
been built.

348
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:41,580
So that kind of the interferometry took
over from about the early two thousands

349
00:22:42,761 --> 00:22:47,761
or late 1990s and there was a big
war between the people champing the

350
00:22:47,861 --> 00:22:49,480
interferometer technology,

351
00:22:49,481 --> 00:22:54,481
which cost hundreds of millions of
dollars and the people championing the

352
00:22:55,090 --> 00:22:59,680
resonant bar technology, which costs
$100,000. There's a big war between them.

353
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:03,250
And one of the things I document in my
earlier books is how this war played out

354
00:23:03,251 --> 00:23:06,340
and how they want them,
what happened. But you know,

355
00:23:06,341 --> 00:23:10,210
by now the resonant bars
are almost forgotten. Um,

356
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:16,000
those are the two big interferometers
in America, one in Hanford,

357
00:23:16,001 --> 00:23:19,630
in Washington state, one
in Livingston, Louisiana.

358
00:23:19,631 --> 00:23:24,130
And there you can see the four kilometer
arms stretching into the distance and

359
00:23:24,131 --> 00:23:28,480
the center station. And it was these
instruments that made the discovery.

360
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:32,240
Uh,
uh,

361
00:23:32,890 --> 00:23:34,600
there are two generations
of these instruments.

362
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:39,620
Initial logo was built to about s when
it was taken down about five or six years

363
00:23:40,661 --> 00:23:45,661
ago and they used the same
housings to putting bigger mirrors,

364
00:23:46,191 --> 00:23:47,210
more powerful lasers,

365
00:23:47,211 --> 00:23:50,900
various other things like this better
suspension itself so that it would work

366
00:23:50,901 --> 00:23:51,734
still better.

367
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:57,190
And that was ready for business in
the autumn of 2015 to February 11th,

368
00:23:57,260 --> 00:24:01,250
February 11th was the press conference,
uh, which you may have seen.

369
00:24:01,251 --> 00:24:05,990
It was all over all the news bulletins
when that gravity waves have been

370
00:24:05,991 --> 00:24:06,680
discovered.

371
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:10,310
I was up here in London because they
had a little press conference in London.

372
00:24:10,430 --> 00:24:14,810
I went to that and uh,
down in the basement of the building,

373
00:24:14,811 --> 00:24:15,670
we went after it.

374
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:19,660
We went for a drink and I was
doing high fives or as a physicist,

375
00:24:19,661 --> 00:24:23,920
RSP announcement came up on the
BBC news at six o'clock. Um,

376
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:29,570
this is the very first email. I
keep writing. September the 14th.

377
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:30,890
I'm sorry about that.
Um,

378
00:24:32,090 --> 00:24:37,020
that's the phrase high old CWB.
Oh,

379
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:42,020
I was just put on grace DB, a very
interesting event in the last hour. Okay.

380
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:45,980
Um, if you want to find out what all
that, all those technical terms mean,

381
00:24:45,981 --> 00:24:50,180
you'll have to read the book. It's all
explained in some detail, but that was it.

382
00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:56,120
Um,
but it didn't excite me particularly.

383
00:24:56,750 --> 00:24:59,090
I just thought, oh, I better
save. I say I've been,

384
00:25:00,590 --> 00:25:05,270
I'm always getting 'em for years been
getting dozens of emails a day from the

385
00:25:05,271 --> 00:25:07,310
gravitational wave community. Every
now and I'm going to think, oh,

386
00:25:07,311 --> 00:25:10,040
that might be interesting.
I'll put them in a separate folder.

387
00:25:10,041 --> 00:25:12,410
But mostly I just delete them
after reading the subject line.

388
00:25:12,411 --> 00:25:15,190
But this one I thought, well,
I'll start putting them in pop,

389
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:19,290
sort of putting these in their own
folder and see how it fades out. Uh,

390
00:25:19,710 --> 00:25:20,543
and you know,

391
00:25:20,570 --> 00:25:24,200
a couple of months later I just
reaffirmed that I was not the only person

392
00:25:24,201 --> 00:25:24,921
thinking like that.

393
00:25:24,921 --> 00:25:28,280
So you can read that quote from
a gravitational wave physicist.

394
00:25:41,670 --> 00:25:45,800
No, he says, could it have appeared
so earlier the run, it's because the,

395
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:48,120
the machines weren't
officially switched on.

396
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:52,500
They weren't supposed to be officially
switched on for another few days.

397
00:25:53,130 --> 00:25:56,880
This was what we've got and what was
going on with an engineering run and they

398
00:25:56,881 --> 00:26:01,080
were still being shaken
down. Uh, as it happens,

399
00:26:01,081 --> 00:26:05,100
that was an extraordinary lucky thing.
On the one hand,

400
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:09,930
people are data. This shouldn't
happen in engineering run and all.

401
00:26:09,931 --> 00:26:11,730
We are in a position to
make any claim with this,

402
00:26:11,790 --> 00:26:15,990
given that it's in an engineering
run, uh, there'll be too much noise.

403
00:26:16,290 --> 00:26:19,260
Machine won't be steady enough, people
who have been messing about with it.

404
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:23,010
But it turned out people hadn't been
messing about with it just around the time

405
00:26:23,610 --> 00:26:28,610
and there was just enough sort of period
of smooth noise for them to be able to

406
00:26:29,071 --> 00:26:29,904
do this.
Two,

407
00:26:31,170 --> 00:26:34,170
for that to be enough of that period for
them to be able to do the calculations,

408
00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:36,690
the statistical calculations
they needed to do.

409
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:39,930
So that's the so early in the run.

410
00:26:39,931 --> 00:26:44,931
But the great advantage of it being so
early in the is that it made it very

411
00:26:46,141 --> 00:26:51,141
unlikely that this was a blind injection
because that's what all the physicists

412
00:26:52,550 --> 00:26:54,210
burger by this time fed up with.

413
00:26:54,211 --> 00:26:59,211
They'd already spent a lot of their
lives analyzing and investigating blind

414
00:26:59,821 --> 00:27:04,440
injections and they didn't want to have
to investigate another blind injection

415
00:27:05,310 --> 00:27:06,121
and they thought,
oh no,

416
00:27:06,121 --> 00:27:09,060
this is the management shoving it in
another blind injection to test us again.

417
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:12,720
And nobody knows what to do because
if you're seriously investigating

418
00:27:12,721 --> 00:27:16,290
gravitational waves, your
life changes. You know, you,

419
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:20,760
you stopped talking to your partner
and family on seeing your kids.

420
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,400
You're working like hell
to analyze the data.

421
00:27:24,090 --> 00:27:29,090
And it's even worse for me because
I had written two books about blind

422
00:27:30,091 --> 00:27:33,480
injections, which was a
good thing. Thought that was
fine. I was happy about it,

423
00:27:33,481 --> 00:27:36,750
but there was nowhere I was going to
write a third about a blind injection.

424
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:40,170
And that meant if it had
been a blonde injection,

425
00:27:40,171 --> 00:27:42,990
I would have been wasting another
three months of my life. Now,

426
00:27:42,991 --> 00:27:45,810
I spoke to the director of the project
and said, look, this is going to happen.

427
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:47,670
If you put it in another blind injection,

428
00:27:47,671 --> 00:27:50,670
you better tell me because
I can't spend another,

429
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:54,630
I'm too old to spend another three minutes
of my life messing about with a blind

430
00:27:54,631 --> 00:27:59,520
injection. And he kind of, I think we
had an understanding that he would.

431
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:04,350
Okay. Um, and then we worked
out how am I going to keep it,

432
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:09,330
the fact that I know secret from everybody
else and I'll pretend I'm very also,

433
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:11,970
I can't get on the planes
to fly to meetings,

434
00:28:11,971 --> 00:28:14,550
which I thought would be necessary
at that time. Turned out not to be.

435
00:28:15,390 --> 00:28:19,430
And we said we sorta had a
nod and a wink about that. Uh,

436
00:28:19,890 --> 00:28:23,190
but because it happened
in this engineering run,

437
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:28,470
most people were ready to believe that
directorate when they sent around an

438
00:28:28,471 --> 00:28:31,980
email saying, no, this is not
a blind injection. I mean,
there's a lot of paranoia.

439
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:35,550
There were people who still didn't
believe him. I thought that Boston is,

440
00:28:35,551 --> 00:28:37,180
they're trying to test us even more,
you know.

441
00:28:38,370 --> 00:28:41,700
But eventually people decided was
nothing we could do about this.

442
00:28:41,701 --> 00:28:43,560
We've got to get on with the analysis.

443
00:28:43,561 --> 00:28:45,840
And I decided if this turns
out to be a planned injection,

444
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:48,990
that's the last I'm going to
have to do with lugger. Okay.

445
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:50,920
But it wasn't a blind injection.
And,

446
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:55,350
and I was reassured by
the fact five minutes,

447
00:28:56,130 --> 00:28:58,920
I'm going to take a bit longer
than my promised half hour. Okay.

448
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:04,170
Is that all right? So, uh, uh, I,

449
00:29:04,171 --> 00:29:07,200
uh, it was okay. Then the other
thing that people starting to do,

450
00:29:07,290 --> 00:29:10,260
so you've got this signal, do
you believe it or not? Well,

451
00:29:10,261 --> 00:29:12,990
I will tell you that remarkably,

452
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:18,020
and this was completely astonishing given
the paranoia that was around that it

453
00:29:18,810 --> 00:29:22,980
only took about two days before people
began to believe this is a real signal.

454
00:29:24,450 --> 00:29:26,740
Once they dismissed the idea of,
you know,

455
00:29:26,790 --> 00:29:29,220
the hadn't yet dismiss the
idea of blind injection.

456
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:32,550
And the other thing that everybody was
worried about it, was it a malicious hack,

457
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:34,860
was it some clever,

458
00:29:34,861 --> 00:29:39,861
malicious people from Google
who got into the system and

459
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:48,000
something which appeared to be a
gravitational wave into the big machines.

460
00:29:48,730 --> 00:29:52,510
And one of the big efforts was to work
out well, what would it take to do?

461
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:55,990
Is it credible that somebody could
have hacked into it and done this?

462
00:29:55,990 --> 00:29:58,300
And the conclusion was, no, it wasn't.

463
00:29:58,330 --> 00:30:01,820
It would have required to bigger
conspiracy and it couldn't be done.

464
00:30:01,821 --> 00:30:06,490
And people were reasonably satisfied
with that notion though the idea of a

465
00:30:06,491 --> 00:30:10,510
malicious hack or hackers still around
among the fringe scientists who don't

466
00:30:10,511 --> 00:30:15,490
believe this. Um, so that was
another thing that was sent a lot,

467
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:18,160
spent a lot of time and was then
the analysis starts, you know,

468
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:23,470
the belief that belief in two days came
because the signal produced a very nice

469
00:30:23,471 --> 00:30:28,471
way for which very nicely matched to
signal from an inspiring binary pair of

470
00:30:31,241 --> 00:30:32,074
black holes.

471
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:37,630
And the way form overlapped very nicely
on the two detectors to one at Hanford

472
00:30:37,810 --> 00:30:40,840
and the one that Livingston a
couple of sales and miles apart.

473
00:30:41,410 --> 00:30:43,510
And that got people to believe it.

474
00:30:43,930 --> 00:30:47,320
But that's not good enough
for the physics community.

475
00:30:47,890 --> 00:30:49,390
For the physical community.

476
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:53,740
You have to show that the unlikelihood
of this being due to chance is about one

477
00:30:53,741 --> 00:30:56,860
in three and a half million.
That's the five sigma standard.

478
00:30:56,861 --> 00:30:59,560
There's a whole sociological
story about how that sigma,

479
00:31:00,010 --> 00:31:04,060
how that standard changed in physics from
three sigma and about in the 1960s up

480
00:31:04,061 --> 00:31:07,420
to five sigma in the
earth in Ne two thousands,

481
00:31:08,190 --> 00:31:12,940
which is also discussed in the
book. So, uh, that's the signal.

482
00:31:13,630 --> 00:31:16,420
That's the figure from
the first publication.

483
00:31:16,810 --> 00:31:20,890
That's a sort of slightly simpler and
more easy to understand version of it,

484
00:31:20,891 --> 00:31:24,070
which I got one of the
physicists to draw for me. Uh,

485
00:31:24,130 --> 00:31:26,650
and you can see

486
00:31:28,390 --> 00:31:32,620
how you've got to do a few things. So, um,

487
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:38,380
that's what the signal from one
of these overlapping, sorry,

488
00:31:38,381 --> 00:31:42,580
inspiring binary neutron stars
ought to look like. Okay.

489
00:31:43,090 --> 00:31:46,090
This is more like what it
would look like on the machine.

490
00:31:46,091 --> 00:31:49,300
You've got to take into account the
sensitivity of the machine and various

491
00:31:49,301 --> 00:31:54,301
different frequencies and these are the
actual signals from the machine and they

492
00:31:55,901 --> 00:32:00,280
overlap very nicely as you can see here.
Okay.

493
00:32:00,550 --> 00:32:03,220
And if you take those that
overlapping signal out,

494
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:08,110
this is what you got left and it looks
like noise there in lies a story.

495
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:13,690
Does anybody know I'm doing a piece
of sociological fieldwork now?

496
00:32:15,730 --> 00:32:20,730
Has anybody heard of any recent objections
to the validity of this finding by

497
00:32:20,981 --> 00:32:24,640
Lego? Yeah. Anybody else?

498
00:32:24,641 --> 00:32:28,990
That's one person you've
heard of it? Yeah. Okay.

499
00:32:29,890 --> 00:32:32,050
Yeah.
[inaudible] I really want to know this.

500
00:32:32,051 --> 00:32:36,250
Really put your hands up high because
I want to count one, two, three,

501
00:32:36,550 --> 00:32:41,480
four, five, okay. People
in a room of a hundred.

502
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:47,390
Yeah. Something like that.
Uh, and what they found out,

503
00:32:47,391 --> 00:32:50,630
the people who are making the recent
objection is they've analyzed this

504
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:56,180
and they found out that there
is an overlapping signal here.

505
00:32:57,550 --> 00:32:58,040
Okay.

506
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:03,040
And there is leftover because when the
subtraction was made of this from this,

507
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:07,550
it wasn't done quite right.

508
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:11,390
And so there is in fact a bit
of overlapping signal here.

509
00:33:12,110 --> 00:33:16,160
But for some reason please objectors have
decided that the fact that there's an

510
00:33:16,161 --> 00:33:21,140
overlapping signal there means that the
original detection can't be trusted.

511
00:33:22,090 --> 00:33:22,790
Um,

512
00:33:22,790 --> 00:33:27,740
nobody in Lygo thinks this is just in
any way or not a reasonable objection.

513
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:30,980
And for what my opinion is worth,
I don't think it is either.

514
00:33:31,490 --> 00:33:33,870
But it's interesting sociologically.
Um,

515
00:33:34,610 --> 00:33:37,760
and bears very nicely on the
difference between what you know,

516
00:33:37,761 --> 00:33:41,510
when you're inside a team and what,
you know,

517
00:33:41,630 --> 00:33:46,230
when you're outside of team cause the
objectors or outside the team, you know,

518
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,230
they, they, as most people think,

519
00:33:48,231 --> 00:33:50,210
I don't know how to analyze
their signal properly.

520
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:54,860
And that goes back to my little
experiment on narrow crow,

521
00:33:54,861 --> 00:33:58,490
vast like nature of science.
Um,

522
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:04,070
just, uh, the difference between, uh,

523
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:06,200
how you come to believe in a signal,

524
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:10,760
which was the overlapping way forms and
what you have to do to prove it to the

525
00:34:10,761 --> 00:34:12,140
wider scientific community.

526
00:34:12,141 --> 00:34:16,490
You could read that quotation from one
of the gravitation away physicists.

527
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:20,390
They did a little jiggery pokery
with the statistics. It was,

528
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:23,120
everybody was agonizing.
It wasn't legitimate.

529
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:27,710
It was this statistical massage concluded.
It wasn't statistical matter. I was,

530
00:34:27,711 --> 00:34:31,750
what they did was okay. Uh, and I
believe it was okay as well. But you,

531
00:34:31,970 --> 00:34:35,290
you see how there, that's a
nice thought about it. Um,

532
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:39,910
from one of my colleagues in the
gravitational wave, physicists physics,

533
00:34:40,050 --> 00:34:43,520
and you see how people are worried about
it and you see the reason I put up a

534
00:34:43,521 --> 00:34:43,791
quote,

535
00:34:43,791 --> 00:34:46,430
do you want to see the difference between
what makes people believe in something

536
00:34:46,970 --> 00:34:50,590
and what makes people think about what
they have to do to convince the wider

537
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:55,250
scientific community
the event in its reception?

538
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,010
That's what what was said
at the press conference.

539
00:34:58,011 --> 00:35:02,120
We have detected gravitational
waves. We did it. Uh,

540
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:03,200
what you,

541
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:08,230
nobody knew at the time and what I was
stream me sort of cross a bell was that

542
00:35:09,591 --> 00:35:11,570
the reason,
one of the reasons anyway,

543
00:35:11,571 --> 00:35:16,571
that peep the announcement was made with
such a huge confidence is cause by that

544
00:35:17,031 --> 00:35:20,210
time they had already seen
a second gravitation wave,

545
00:35:21,290 --> 00:35:25,910
which hit on boxing day
2015 December the 26th,

546
00:35:26,990 --> 00:35:29,720
but they decided as they hadn't
finished fully analyzing it,

547
00:35:29,721 --> 00:35:31,940
they weren't going to mention it.
The discovery paper,

548
00:35:32,690 --> 00:35:37,690
I thought this was deceitful and it was
falsifying history because the real,

549
00:35:39,590 --> 00:35:43,080
there have been cases in physics
before where a single event,

550
00:35:43,081 --> 00:35:46,290
it turned out to be wrong. The most
famous one is a magnetic monopole.

551
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:50,040
And the physicists through,
during the course of this whole event,

552
00:35:50,041 --> 00:35:53,130
people were saying, oh, let's hope
this isn't another magnetic monopole.

553
00:35:54,390 --> 00:35:56,050
And then on December the 26th,

554
00:35:56,051 --> 00:35:58,780
the boxing day after a bit
little bit of analysis been done,

555
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:02,100
a great sort of sigh of relief.
Thank heaven we found a second one,

556
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:04,620
but that wasn't mentioned in
their discovery announcement,

557
00:36:04,650 --> 00:36:06,420
which would seem to me
to be completely wrong.

558
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:09,390
Okay.

559
00:36:09,390 --> 00:36:09,511
Uh,

560
00:36:09,511 --> 00:36:12,690
talk to the paper that was the title of
the paper observation of gravitational

561
00:36:12,691 --> 00:36:14,460
waves from binary black hole merger.

562
00:36:14,970 --> 00:36:19,020
And it really did when I was
not in sociological mode,

563
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,220
but getting scientific mode,

564
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:24,960
sen cold shivers down my spine to
imagine this would happen after I'd been

565
00:36:24,961 --> 00:36:29,580
hanging about for 44 years. This is the
event, billion and a half years ago,

566
00:36:29,581 --> 00:36:33,530
a vision and a half light years away,
two black holes of masses,

567
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:38,540
36 and 29 solar masses collided
losing three sons with of mass,

568
00:36:39,210 --> 00:36:42,420
which was totally converted
into gravitational wave energy.

569
00:36:42,750 --> 00:36:47,270
Compare that three solar sons
with a mass with about a gram,

570
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:50,220
a converted into energy
for the first atomic bomb,

571
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:53,970
five pounds for the biggest
hydrogen bomb that's ever been made.

572
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:59,940
If the energy had been admitted
as an electromagnetic radiation,

573
00:36:59,970 --> 00:37:02,100
it would have been brighter
than the full moon,

574
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:07,200
even though it was a bridges and the
half light years away brought in the full

575
00:37:07,201 --> 00:37:08,640
moon for just a fraction of a second.

576
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:11,520
And if it had happened
that where our son was,

577
00:37:11,521 --> 00:37:16,290
it would have evaporated the solar
system in an instant. But as it was,

578
00:37:16,291 --> 00:37:20,790
the energy was emitted as gravitational
waves. Remember I said how faint it is,

579
00:37:20,791 --> 00:37:25,791
faint gravitational radiation is if
you'd been at a distance of our son from

580
00:37:26,431 --> 00:37:28,920
this huge a mission of energy,

581
00:37:29,430 --> 00:37:32,070
all you would have noticed
would have been a slight

582
00:37:32,990 --> 00:37:33,360
okay

583
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:37,360
bang in your ears as
your bones in your ears,

584
00:37:37,361 --> 00:37:40,320
but moved slightly by the
gravitational wave passing by.

585
00:37:40,390 --> 00:37:42,780
You wouldn't notice otherwise.
Uh,

586
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:47,620
the effect on the four
kilometer interferometer
arms changes in the length of

587
00:37:47,621 --> 00:37:52,621
one arm as compared to the other down to
one 10000th of the diameter of a proton

588
00:37:56,350 --> 00:38:00,310
small,
which I worked out and I live in Cardiff,

589
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:01,833
uh,

590
00:38:01,930 --> 00:38:06,170
that's Cardiff Bay taken from what
was then my study Cardiff Bay.

591
00:38:06,171 --> 00:38:07,630
It's about a square mile of water.

592
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:11,560
What you were looking for as a
rise in the level of Cardiff Bay,

593
00:38:12,070 --> 00:38:15,610
which would have been caused by the
addition of one 1000th of a drop of water.

594
00:38:17,590 --> 00:38:20,800
And that's why I said it's
the most sensitive instrument
and it's probably ever

595
00:38:20,810 --> 00:38:21,643
been built.

596
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:26,080
Here's the press conferences
is the newspaper headlines.

597
00:38:26,530 --> 00:38:31,110
There's a song to the tune of,
I'm a believer by some of the physicist.

598
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:35,200
Uh,
there's a huge spike in Google,

599
00:38:36,730 --> 00:38:37,563
okay.

600
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:42,700
Which shows that the whole population
has suddenly become fascinated by

601
00:38:42,701 --> 00:38:46,630
gravitational waves but not
as fascinated as they are.

602
00:38:46,690 --> 00:38:51,070
And Kim Kardashian checked
down the same time.

603
00:38:51,430 --> 00:38:56,430
It's about 2% of Kim Kardashians peak
and it completely invisible by Kim

604
00:38:58,210 --> 00:39:02,230
Kardashian's average popularity.
Okay.

605
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:07,290
A few more things. Uh, how do
we know it's true nowadays?

606
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:10,390
Well, we don't, but the way

607
00:39:13,810 --> 00:39:17,140
discoveries in physics or social changes
and one of the reasons the social

608
00:39:17,141 --> 00:39:20,200
changes come about is because you,
you know,

609
00:39:20,201 --> 00:39:22,240
when to stop questioning,

610
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:26,770
there's all kinds of doubts
you can still think up. Okay.

611
00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:30,610
The whole thing depends on trust
and reasonable level of questioning.

612
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:33,190
On the day of the press announcements,

613
00:39:33,490 --> 00:39:37,200
this was announced in
cern and I listened to the

614
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:43,480
recording of the announcement
in cern and uh, somebody said,

615
00:39:43,481 --> 00:39:46,540
how do we know that the gravity
waves travel at the speed of light?

616
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:48,700
Because we don't travel at the
speed of light. All bets are off.

617
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:51,220
How do we know they travel
at the speed of light?

618
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:54,610
The whole observation is consistent with
them traveling at the speed of light.

619
00:39:54,611 --> 00:39:56,230
But we don't,
we've never had any real proof.

620
00:39:56,770 --> 00:39:59,590
And somebody put up their hand
for the audiences that, look,

621
00:40:00,190 --> 00:40:01,990
if you carry on questioning like this,

622
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:06,430
we'll soon have uninvented the
Higgs Boson. Okay. And that's right.

623
00:40:06,490 --> 00:40:10,180
That's the reason you stopped questioning
because if you question deeply enough,

624
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:15,010
everything collapses and
discovered the Higgs. Um,

625
00:40:15,730 --> 00:40:16,440
then there's,

626
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:19,780
there's a whole lot of stuff here with
the fringe who are criticizing it.

627
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:21,370
They didn't the fringe don't believe it.

628
00:40:21,371 --> 00:40:25,680
I was in touch with fringe scientists
and corresponding with them. Um,

629
00:40:26,890 --> 00:40:31,120
and the reason was, well,
I'd better stop actually. I,

630
00:40:31,130 --> 00:40:32,410
well I just don't have time for questions.

631
00:40:32,411 --> 00:40:36,820
We can always come back to these slides
if you want, but I'll stop there.

632
00:40:45,130 --> 00:40:47,890
We do have time for questions.
Please wait for the microphone.

633
00:40:52,910 --> 00:40:56,540
Why did you pick gravitational
waves community to study?

634
00:40:56,840 --> 00:41:00,260
Pure coincidence? Um, I was doing my phd.

635
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:05,540
I'd already done a study of scientific
communication among people building a new

636
00:41:05,541 --> 00:41:10,270
kind of laser transversely, excited
atmospheric pressure, CO2 laser.

637
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:13,550
I wanted a more competitive
field to compare it with.

638
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:18,800
I read about the controversy in the New
Scientist and I thought that'll do me.

639
00:41:18,830 --> 00:41:19,940
I pick one or two others as well

640
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:23,550
and all that. Is it a community of
sociologists doing quivering book is,

641
00:41:23,551 --> 00:41:26,520
or is it someone embedded in
the Higgs Boson community?

642
00:41:26,830 --> 00:41:31,810
Well, there are sociologists going around
studying, uh, other bits of science.

643
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:35,390
I'm trying to encourage of this kind
of work to be done because I think it's

644
00:41:35,750 --> 00:41:40,750
very important that people outside of
the technical scientific community have a

645
00:41:41,871 --> 00:41:43,790
really deep understanding of science.

646
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:50,073
Yeah.

647
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:51,600
How much does this ups,

648
00:41:51,601 --> 00:41:56,601
the retreat cost and when you take
the whole scientific budget and budget

649
00:41:57,021 --> 00:42:00,290
allocated for the same difficulties
as fundamental assert how much,

650
00:42:00,410 --> 00:42:04,430
how it is I am located for
this particular device.

651
00:42:04,650 --> 00:42:08,970
Okay. Well the whole lot you can say
nowadays by now it's cost about a billion

652
00:42:08,970 --> 00:42:11,160
dollars.
Um,

653
00:42:11,990 --> 00:42:15,060
I don't know how that compares with
the scientific budget as a whole.

654
00:42:16,050 --> 00:42:21,050
One of the problems for the interferometer
was being so expensive that I should

655
00:42:22,190 --> 00:42:27,190
have said they were funded by the national
US National Science Foundation and it

656
00:42:27,271 --> 00:42:30,360
was the biggest experiment in the National
Science Foundation. Had ever funded.

657
00:42:30,810 --> 00:42:32,250
Uh, now, um,

658
00:42:32,370 --> 00:42:36,900
high energy physics is mostly funded by
the Department of Energy and they have a

659
00:42:36,901 --> 00:42:38,040
lot more money.

660
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:44,000
So the trouble with gravity waves is
it had an impact on the many scientists

661
00:42:44,191 --> 00:42:47,370
doing much smaller experiments
which were funded by the NSF.

662
00:42:47,670 --> 00:42:51,390
So it became very unpopular
among a large constituency.

663
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:56,640
Um, but uh, when people ask me how
much it costs, I always say, well,

664
00:42:56,670 --> 00:42:59,670
it's probably about the same as
the wing of a stealth fighter.

665
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:07,130
Compare it with, with military budgets
to put it in perspective. I see.

666
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:10,800
There must be the similar ones built
all around the world also. Right.

667
00:43:10,801 --> 00:43:14,350
I heard in India is they are
building one there. Yeah.

668
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:19,070
It didn't make sense to spend that much
money there. Yeah. The Indian, yeah.

669
00:43:19,090 --> 00:43:24,010
One is, is um, the Indian
in India there now,

670
00:43:24,011 --> 00:43:26,590
and it's been a long negotiation
over this, they're building

671
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:30,430
the infrastructure for it,

672
00:43:30,431 --> 00:43:33,340
the beam tubes and the foundations
and the buildings in India.

673
00:43:33,700 --> 00:43:38,560
But the interferometer parts are coming
from America because when initial logo

674
00:43:38,561 --> 00:43:42,970
was built, they built three interferometer
within the beam tubes for two,

675
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:45,850
and they're taking the third
one and that's going to India.

676
00:43:46,420 --> 00:43:50,490
Why does it make sense? Well, what
does the whole thing makes sense? Um,

677
00:43:50,810 --> 00:43:54,340
it makes sense because he's a fantastic
confirmation of Einstein's general

678
00:43:54,341 --> 00:43:57,610
theory of relativity. But it also
makes sense if you like astronomy,

679
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:03,000
because what where it goes is the
foundation of a new gravitational wave

680
00:44:05,830 --> 00:44:06,610
astronomy,

681
00:44:06,610 --> 00:44:09,940
which enables you to see things that
you can't see with electromagnetic

682
00:44:09,941 --> 00:44:13,660
astronomy. So you can pretty well
looked directly at black holes,

683
00:44:13,930 --> 00:44:15,910
which can't be seen any other way.

684
00:44:16,540 --> 00:44:20,830
So this phenomenon that was discovered
this in spiraling of two black holes,

685
00:44:21,130 --> 00:44:24,400
nobody knew if such things existed.
So there were two discoveries,

686
00:44:24,490 --> 00:44:28,210
the first discovery of gravitational
waves and the first discovery of inspiring

687
00:44:28,211 --> 00:44:32,160
binary black holes. Why do
we need another one in? Well,

688
00:44:32,910 --> 00:44:37,910
what the ideal is is to move this
astronomy along so that you can see a

689
00:44:38,431 --> 00:44:41,820
gravitational wave and compare
its position in the sky.

690
00:44:42,150 --> 00:44:45,420
Look at this position in the sky
with electromagnetic telescopes.

691
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:49,350
And for that reason, you've got
to know its position in the sky.

692
00:44:49,380 --> 00:44:54,360
And the only way to know its position in
the sky is pro by triangulation of the

693
00:44:54,361 --> 00:44:59,361
time of arrival of the event on widely
separated instruments at the moment,

694
00:45:00,510 --> 00:45:01,740
with only two instruments,

695
00:45:02,930 --> 00:45:05,940
you get huge area on the sky
where it could've come from.

696
00:45:05,970 --> 00:45:08,580
There's a third one actually in Italy,
which is just coming online.

697
00:45:09,630 --> 00:45:10,680
And then with indium on,

698
00:45:10,681 --> 00:45:14,940
there'll be four fairly widely separated
and you may be able to narrow down the

699
00:45:14,941 --> 00:45:17,760
position in the sky more narrowly then,

700
00:45:18,150 --> 00:45:20,730
and then your gravitational
story will get better and better.

701
00:45:22,690 --> 00:45:23,523
Yeah.

702
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:28,730
Um, with hindsight, we
can suddenly tells it,

703
00:45:29,350 --> 00:45:33,310
uh, the first 40 years
of, uh, informative,

704
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:36,560
uh,
we're clearly not sensitive enough.

705
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:40,580
Well, if not 40 years of
interferometry is 14 years, 14 years

706
00:45:40,630 --> 00:45:44,730
detectors. Yeah. Um, was
there any acknowledgement of
the time that this might be?

707
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:47,730
Um, yeah, I mean,

708
00:45:48,690 --> 00:45:53,580
Joe Weber I interviewed in 72 told
me that when he built this apparatus,

709
00:45:53,581 --> 00:45:57,360
he didn't expect to see anything because
everybody knew it was not sensitive

710
00:45:57,361 --> 00:46:01,500
enough. By factor of a, you
know, a thousand million.

711
00:46:02,610 --> 00:46:04,080
Uh, and, uh,

712
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:10,490
the question is what do you do when you
make you appear to make a discovery,

713
00:46:10,491 --> 00:46:13,640
which ought to be impossible,
do say, oh, forget about it.

714
00:46:13,820 --> 00:46:18,020
It's theoretically impossible or you
say, well, maybe we need to think,

715
00:46:18,050 --> 00:46:19,400
rethink our theories through.

716
00:46:20,270 --> 00:46:24,890
And a lot of people did start rethinking
their theories and find ways to make

717
00:46:24,891 --> 00:46:28,880
Joe Weber's findings
compatible with theory,

718
00:46:28,881 --> 00:46:32,960
like focusing of gravitational
waves by some curious mechanism.

719
00:46:33,290 --> 00:46:34,460
So there's a dilemma there.

720
00:46:35,270 --> 00:46:39,080
And that dilemma was played out and
among the people who put experiment first

721
00:46:39,081 --> 00:46:43,340
and the people who put theory first.
So everybody knew that in theory,

722
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:45,890
at least in the initial theory,

723
00:46:46,550 --> 00:46:49,430
these instruments were far too
insensitive to see anything.

724
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:54,140
But the determined experimentalists
still felt well, if I've seen something,

725
00:46:54,380 --> 00:46:55,280
I'm going to report it.

726
00:47:00,330 --> 00:47:01,163
Okay.

727
00:47:01,270 --> 00:47:02,290
Do you see any,
um,

728
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:07,360
sociological parallels between the whole
field of gravitational waves and people

729
00:47:08,711 --> 00:47:11,680
were kind of on coming on both
sides of it to climate science?

730
00:47:12,940 --> 00:47:17,050
Oh, yes. Um, the, uh, as I said,

731
00:47:17,051 --> 00:47:21,790
I did my first lot of interviews in 1972
and then another lot of interviews in

732
00:47:21,791 --> 00:47:24,730
75,
uh,

733
00:47:25,130 --> 00:47:30,130
7,272 in 1974 I wrote the paper that
emerged out of the 1972 fieldwork and the

734
00:47:37,091 --> 00:47:38,270
big claim in that paper,

735
00:47:38,380 --> 00:47:43,150
the reason I got a university secure
university job and had a stellar career

736
00:47:43,210 --> 00:47:48,040
subsequently was the
observation I made it.

737
00:47:48,041 --> 00:47:51,610
There was something called the
experimenters regress and experimenters,

738
00:47:51,611 --> 00:47:54,880
regressed goes like this.
Uh, scientists say, well,

739
00:47:54,881 --> 00:47:57,580
if you want to know whether something's
true or not, you have to replicate it.

740
00:47:57,640 --> 00:47:58,870
And I think that's correct.

741
00:47:59,350 --> 00:48:02,260
But the trouble is how do you know whether
you've replicated something or not?

742
00:48:02,830 --> 00:48:06,940
So the people who copied
Joe Weber's experiment or
roughly copied it said, look,

743
00:48:06,941 --> 00:48:09,820
we've built an operator's like yours,
Joe, and we don't see anything.

744
00:48:10,090 --> 00:48:13,210
And Joe Weber said to them, that's
because you haven't built it. Right.

745
00:48:13,990 --> 00:48:18,520
And that's not an unreasonable claim
because doing an experiment is very, very,

746
00:48:18,521 --> 00:48:22,210
very, very difficult thing about
day experiments you did at school.

747
00:48:22,750 --> 00:48:25,840
They never worked mostly.
Okay.

748
00:48:26,260 --> 00:48:29,800
You have to be told by the school teacher
that they weren't working and you had

749
00:48:29,801 --> 00:48:32,800
to keep on repeating them
until you got them to work.

750
00:48:33,130 --> 00:48:37,180
And this is what Joe Weber said the
other people needed to be doing. Yeah.

751
00:48:37,510 --> 00:48:42,510
So what happens is if you look at
what happened in 72 and for few years

752
00:48:44,710 --> 00:48:48,310
afterwards, the argument turned
from has this been repeated to

753
00:48:49,930 --> 00:48:52,450
who's competent to repeat it?

754
00:48:53,230 --> 00:48:57,190
Who's the most competent experiment or
is it Joe Weber or is it his rivals?

755
00:48:58,150 --> 00:49:02,390
And then when you get this idea, you see
it happens all the time. Cold fusion,

756
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:05,140
climate change.
Yes,

757
00:49:05,260 --> 00:49:09,400
you can put this template onto
climate change and it works very well.

758
00:49:10,270 --> 00:49:13,810
I mean, the next problem you have
having done all that is to say,

759
00:49:13,811 --> 00:49:18,280
well how do we come down on the
right side of climate change?

760
00:49:18,281 --> 00:49:23,281
And I'd had been voted in huge rowel
since the early two thousands with my

761
00:49:24,431 --> 00:49:28,990
colleagues because we put forward a view
that we have to shift our attention in

762
00:49:28,991 --> 00:49:33,760
social studies of science from how do
you reach the truth to how do you decide

763
00:49:33,761 --> 00:49:34,594
who's an expert?

764
00:49:35,710 --> 00:49:39,250
And you should always listen to the
experts whether they're right or wrong

765
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:43,240
because otherwise your society is going
to collapse and you're going to have a

766
00:49:43,241 --> 00:49:44,074
dystopia.

767
00:49:44,860 --> 00:49:49,510
And fortunately my friend Donald Trump
has come along to help my views get

768
00:49:49,530 --> 00:49:50,363
sober.

769
00:49:55,260 --> 00:49:57,190
Thanks very much for your talk.
And I was just curious,

770
00:49:57,191 --> 00:50:01,540
you mentioned before about how black
holes can't be observed, you know,

771
00:50:01,541 --> 00:50:03,600
any other way except
for gravitational waves.

772
00:50:03,601 --> 00:50:07,780
So how did they know when they observed
these gravitational waves that they were

773
00:50:07,870 --> 00:50:10,920
two black holes rotating?
Is it because, um,

774
00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:13,210
they had a theoretical
model of what the garden,

775
00:50:13,220 --> 00:50:15,520
the station Louise would look
like in this kind of matched it?

776
00:50:15,521 --> 00:50:18,280
Or was there some other way that they
knew these black holes were there?

777
00:50:18,980 --> 00:50:23,930
Uh, no. Uh, it's a good question.
Um, so two things. Yeah.

778
00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:24,501
Firstly,

779
00:50:24,501 --> 00:50:29,501
you've got this model which took years
and years and decades to work out,

780
00:50:30,770 --> 00:50:34,490
which didn't match it.
But then at the time people were saying,

781
00:50:35,480 --> 00:50:40,330
but maybe they're not black holes. Maybe
their bows on stars. Bose OnStar's.

782
00:50:40,340 --> 00:50:43,750
Why about the same as
black holes? Okay. Uh,

783
00:50:43,790 --> 00:50:47,180
and but who's ever seen a Bose onstar
we've seen even less than black hole.

784
00:50:47,181 --> 00:50:50,390
This is just a figment of
theoretical physicists imagination.

785
00:50:50,391 --> 00:50:53,960
You can imagine anything and I'm
tearing out my hair saying, oh no,

786
00:50:53,961 --> 00:50:56,770
not those on stars.
We know bows on styles for haven't sake.

787
00:50:56,771 --> 00:50:58,880
Let's have a discovery at last.
I want to die.

788
00:50:58,910 --> 00:51:03,910
Having reported to discovery and the
bows on star sorta thing faded away,

789
00:51:04,430 --> 00:51:08,120
but it's one of those things you
could still ask. You could still ask,

790
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:12,680
has it really been black hose? And people
could still argue now expose on stars.

791
00:51:12,950 --> 00:51:16,820
It's one of those places where you say
time to stop questioning guys. Okay.

792
00:51:18,020 --> 00:51:18,853
Then

793
00:51:20,030 --> 00:51:23,420
there was another nice little argument
produced for why they had to be black

794
00:51:23,421 --> 00:51:24,254
holes.

795
00:51:24,830 --> 00:51:29,830
They could tell how far apart these things
where just before they collided from

796
00:51:31,341 --> 00:51:36,341
the speed of rotation and they knew how
much they weighed also from that kind of

797
00:51:36,621 --> 00:51:37,250
thing.

798
00:51:37,250 --> 00:51:41,300
And you could work out that nothing
that wasn't very compact could get that

799
00:51:41,301 --> 00:51:45,020
close without touching. And that was
another argument for being black holes.

800
00:51:45,170 --> 00:51:50,030
So it's a good question
because the argument is still
not completely settled but

801
00:51:50,150 --> 00:51:50,983
it's settled

802
00:51:52,610 --> 00:51:56,870
if you're a physicist and you want
to be called kind of reasonably sign.

803
00:51:58,240 --> 00:51:58,700
Okay.

804
00:51:58,700 --> 00:52:03,050
Um, have you now finished
with the gravitational waves
community or what are you

805
00:52:03,051 --> 00:52:03,591
going to do your next?

806
00:52:03,591 --> 00:52:05,750
I don't think anything else is
still going on that you're studying.

807
00:52:05,860 --> 00:52:08,570
That's a very good question. Again,
because I thought I'd finished.

808
00:52:09,130 --> 00:52:13,970
I decided that this was the time
to finish. Nothing is exciting.

809
00:52:13,971 --> 00:52:17,180
This is ever going to happen to
me in my life. Studying again,

810
00:52:17,240 --> 00:52:22,240
my life studying physicist and I've kind
of corralled somebody else to carry on

811
00:52:23,030 --> 00:52:28,030
after me looking at a gravitational
wave physics and continuing to write the

812
00:52:28,311 --> 00:52:30,680
detailed history of it cause I
don't want it to stop suddenly.

813
00:52:30,740 --> 00:52:35,740
But this business about
these guys objecting to it
is really interesting from a

814
00:52:36,861 --> 00:52:38,000
sociological point of view.

815
00:52:38,001 --> 00:52:42,440
So I've found myself getting sucked into
it again and I'll probably write a bit

816
00:52:42,441 --> 00:52:44,900
more about it before I
do completely finish.

817
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:47,180
Okay.

818
00:52:47,180 --> 00:52:51,560
We are unfortunately out of time. We
have one time for one more question. Oh,

819
00:52:51,890 --> 00:52:55,430
hopefully a quick question then.
Um, so if expertise is very narrow,

820
00:52:55,640 --> 00:52:57,050
going back to your chart at the beginning,

821
00:52:57,590 --> 00:53:00,890
but we should identify the
experts and believe them,

822
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:05,330
right or wrong is do those two things
make life difficult when you put them

823
00:53:05,331 --> 00:53:06,164
together?

824
00:53:07,210 --> 00:53:08,043
MMM,

825
00:53:10,980 --> 00:53:11,813
I don't think so.

826
00:53:13,380 --> 00:53:18,380
I mean there's another whole element
of which experts you believe in you,

827
00:53:18,631 --> 00:53:21,810
you also have to believe
that only in decent,

828
00:53:21,811 --> 00:53:26,430
honest experts and there's plenty of
non decent dishonest experts around,

829
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:29,760
but you need a different kind of argument.

830
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:32,570
I mean there are different kinds of
investigative technique to find out who

831
00:53:32,571 --> 00:53:35,220
those those are. I mean, the,

832
00:53:35,221 --> 00:53:40,221
the instant that I always
use as my touchstone it,

833
00:53:41,821 --> 00:53:44,220
how to think about these
things is the mumps,

834
00:53:44,221 --> 00:53:48,320
measles and rubella
vaccination controversy. And a,

835
00:53:48,380 --> 00:53:52,680
this is one of the things that got me
started in sort of big high to buy lots of

836
00:53:52,681 --> 00:53:57,210
people in social studies of
science because I noticed
that many of my colleagues

837
00:53:57,211 --> 00:54:00,930
in the field wanted to defend the parents,
right?

838
00:54:01,410 --> 00:54:05,280
Not to vaccinate their children during
the course of the mumps, measles,

839
00:54:05,281 --> 00:54:10,020
rubella controversy.
And my view was that was terrible.

840
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:14,010
And that in fact a parent had
to vaccinate their children.

841
00:54:14,910 --> 00:54:18,540
And the reason is if you,
if you look at what, uh,

842
00:54:19,140 --> 00:54:22,260
Andrew Wakefield, the person who
started the whole controversy said,

843
00:54:22,261 --> 00:54:23,700
if you look at his paper in the Lancet,

844
00:54:23,970 --> 00:54:28,500
I was reading it just the other day
actually, he had no evidence at all

845
00:54:30,050 --> 00:54:33,620
that mumps, measles and rubella
vaccine, we'll link to autism.

846
00:54:34,220 --> 00:54:38,690
There's lots of allusions and
asides in that original paper.

847
00:54:38,691 --> 00:54:42,020
But the paper says we haven't proved
it and he certainly hadn't approved it.

848
00:54:42,980 --> 00:54:45,650
And if you allow a panic
like this to arise,

849
00:54:45,651 --> 00:54:50,651
it was very much a amplified by the
press who have a view that they should

850
00:54:51,081 --> 00:54:54,940
always tell a balanced story. Will
that balanced story? It was about,

851
00:54:55,910 --> 00:54:56,510
yeah,

852
00:54:56,510 --> 00:55:00,230
on the one side we're parents poor
things who'd seen their children become

853
00:55:00,231 --> 00:55:03,770
autistic a little while after
receiving the MMR vaccine.

854
00:55:04,550 --> 00:55:08,750
And the other side of the balance
was the huge epidemiological studies,

855
00:55:08,751 --> 00:55:13,010
which showed that nowhere
where MMR vaccine had been
introduced into countries.

856
00:55:13,011 --> 00:55:17,090
Was there any increase in the
instance of MMR in a population?

857
00:55:18,370 --> 00:55:21,740
And the latter thing is the
end of the story. The parents,

858
00:55:22,040 --> 00:55:23,810
we're always going to see

859
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:30,520
some children going becoming autistic
after they'd been injected with MMR

860
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:35,690
because both things happen about same age.
Okay.

861
00:55:35,691 --> 00:55:39,110
And there would be an equal number of
children who nobody would be talking about

862
00:55:39,860 --> 00:55:44,000
who would have re who would have received
the MMR just after becoming autistic,

863
00:55:44,390 --> 00:55:45,590
but nobody was talking about them.

864
00:55:46,010 --> 00:55:49,070
So all this balancing in the
newspapers and so on was wrong.

865
00:55:49,071 --> 00:55:52,670
And one of the arguments that really
infuriated me by one of my colleagues was,

866
00:55:52,980 --> 00:55:53,813
but look,

867
00:55:54,260 --> 00:55:59,260
there might be up there is a possibility
that some small sex subsection of

868
00:55:59,781 --> 00:56:04,220
children who are peculiarly vulnerable
in some way were affected by the MMR

869
00:56:04,221 --> 00:56:08,690
vaccine. The epidemiological statistics
are two large scale to deal with that.

870
00:56:09,260 --> 00:56:10,940
And of course he was absolutely right,

871
00:56:11,210 --> 00:56:15,410
but you could make exactly
the same argument for whether
people became autistic

872
00:56:15,411 --> 00:56:20,150
just after eight in the Kiwi fruit for
the first time or anything else you'd

873
00:56:20,151 --> 00:56:20,750
like.

874
00:56:20,750 --> 00:56:25,750
So if you allow this kind of non-expert
inference from observational statistics

875
00:56:27,250 --> 00:56:28,780
to enter the public domain,

876
00:56:29,020 --> 00:56:33,010
you can waste all your national health
service money on scares and never get

877
00:56:33,011 --> 00:56:37,390
anywhere. I mean the whole argument is
always carried out under the constraint of

878
00:56:37,391 --> 00:56:39,960
scarcity.
And so it's an,

879
00:56:40,060 --> 00:56:43,440
it's not a question of what
absolutely right. In the longterm,

880
00:56:43,510 --> 00:56:46,930
it probably is the case that one
or two kids are vulnerable to MMR.

881
00:56:47,350 --> 00:56:50,920
But it's no good saying it.
It doesn't get you to the policy answer.

882
00:56:52,030 --> 00:56:56,290
So that's my answer to
your question. So, so it,

883
00:56:56,291 --> 00:57:01,210
does that answer your question?
Okay. Thank you very much,
Professor Harry Collins.

884
