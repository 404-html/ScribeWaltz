1
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:14,490
All right. So, uh, so Emily,
this is your first book. It is,

2
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:18,460
you didn't want to start with something
simpler, a brief history of time maybe.

3
00:00:18,461 --> 00:00:22,660
I mean, I know that's been
done, but, um, but, but uh,

4
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:23,680
as you write in the book,
He,

5
00:00:23,681 --> 00:00:27,070
and this is the most complicated robot
ever sent to another planet, in fact,

6
00:00:27,071 --> 00:00:30,380
ever sent off earth. Why did you, why
did you want to write about this and,

7
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:32,830
and why do you say that it's
the most complicated? Oh,

8
00:00:32,831 --> 00:00:36,310
I think it's fair to admit that I didn't
realize what I was getting into when I

9
00:00:36,311 --> 00:00:40,480
started writing this book. In fact, as
I, as I explained in the introduction,

10
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:44,070
it's not actually the book that I
meant to write to begin with. It's, uh,

11
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:47,710
I was approached by Springer to write
a book about the curiosity mission.

12
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:49,210
And I wrote,

13
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:53,200
and I wrote and I wrote and I
wasn't finishing and I couldn't,

14
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:57,520
I wound up with a tremendous quantity of
material and it wasn't able to wrap it

15
00:00:57,521 --> 00:01:00,190
up. And I finally figured out that the
reason I was having so much trouble it was

16
00:01:00,191 --> 00:01:02,050
because I'd accidentally
written two books.

17
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:06,550
And so this is actually just the
first of a pair of books on curiosity.

18
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,850
The second one is going to be coming out
next year and will be about the science

19
00:01:09,851 --> 00:01:10,211
mission.

20
00:01:10,211 --> 00:01:15,090
So I kind of was able to partition the
engineering stuff into one book and

21
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:16,390
science to another book.

22
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:20,440
And basically this is the book that I
needed in order to be able to understand

23
00:01:20,441 --> 00:01:23,320
the rover well enough to be able
to write about it. Science mission.

24
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:26,140
And so now I'm writing about the science.
I'm actually,

25
00:01:26,141 --> 00:01:28,810
I've got a copy on my desk and I
keep on referring to it all the time.

26
00:01:28,811 --> 00:01:31,630
How many of this thing does it have and
how long did it and when did this fail?

27
00:01:31,631 --> 00:01:35,260
And it's all in there. Um, so, so,

28
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:37,440
so tell us a little more about
why it is the most, what,

29
00:01:37,441 --> 00:01:41,450
what makes it the most complicated robot
we've ever sent off this planet? It's a,

30
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:47,360
it's sort of the culmination of a long
history of NASA is exploration of Mars.

31
00:01:47,361 --> 00:01:52,160
And, um, I think that the key to
its complexity is that as you,

32
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:56,630
um, NASA builds on from one mission to
the next, you begin with a very basic,

33
00:01:56,631 --> 00:01:58,430
broad set of questions.
What is Mars?

34
00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:01,880
And you map it and you find out some
more things about what it is and then you

35
00:02:01,881 --> 00:02:04,850
ask more detailed questions.
Was water ever important on Mars?

36
00:02:04,851 --> 00:02:08,330
And spirit and opportunity were sent
with this mantra, follow the water,

37
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:11,760
try to understand how mark,
uh, water was active on Mars.

38
00:02:11,761 --> 00:02:15,050
And the past curiosities questions
are more subtle than that.

39
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:17,270
We know that there was water on Mars,

40
00:02:17,271 --> 00:02:20,390
but did they ever have a
habitable environment that, um,

41
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:22,310
Mike organisms might have
been able to live in?

42
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:24,200
And so as the questions get subtler,

43
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:28,190
the investigations that you have to do
to try to answer those questions get more

44
00:02:28,191 --> 00:02:32,120
detailed, more complicated. Um, it's not
enough just to snap pictures anymore.

45
00:02:32,121 --> 00:02:34,520
You have to have much more
detailed kinds of data.

46
00:02:34,521 --> 00:02:38,780
And curiosity has these
two highly sophisticated
laboratory instruments that are

47
00:02:38,781 --> 00:02:43,781
designed to ingest solid samples and
perform x Ray diffraction and ex-ray a

48
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:49,130
fluorescence feet performs
gas chromatograph mass
spectrometry with a tuneable

49
00:02:49,131 --> 00:02:51,470
laser spectrometer at a
quadrupole mass spectrometer.

50
00:02:51,471 --> 00:02:53,870
It's kind of like all of these
laboratory instruments that have been

51
00:02:53,871 --> 00:02:55,760
miniaturized to fit inside the rover.

52
00:02:56,120 --> 00:03:00,250
And so just supporting that
hardware requires a host of,

53
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:04,090
of subsystems that are necessary
to keep the thing alive.

54
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:07,000
You also have to have a mission
that lasts a lot longer.

55
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:10,870
The warranty on spirit and
opportunity is famously only 90 days.

56
00:03:10,871 --> 00:03:14,600
And of course opportunity is still
going after 5,000 and something Saul's,

57
00:03:14,601 --> 00:03:15,720
do you know off the top of your head?
Huh?

58
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:20,710
Uh, let me check my Mars time
APP. Why it's 5,107 Saul's today,

59
00:03:20,711 --> 00:03:21,010
Emily.

60
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:25,790
All right, very good. So yeah, curiosity
has not lasted nearly so long yet.

61
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:26,720
Um,

62
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:31,720
and in fact it's quite likely that
curiosity will not last as many sauces as

63
00:03:32,961 --> 00:03:36,560
opportunity does. It's almost
certain. Um, but anyway,

64
00:03:36,561 --> 00:03:40,580
the point is that that the opportunity
was only warranted to last 90 days.

65
00:03:40,581 --> 00:03:43,130
It was supposed to be able to accomplish
it's prime mission in that amount of

66
00:03:43,131 --> 00:03:46,490
time. Curiosities, warranty
ran out after a first year.

67
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:51,410
And so you have to build a much more
robust systems. First Martian, yeah,

68
00:03:51,411 --> 00:03:54,500
first Martian year. Yes,
that's correct. Um, uh,

69
00:03:54,501 --> 00:03:57,680
you have to build much more robust
systems to be able to support all of that.

70
00:03:57,681 --> 00:04:01,220
And so that also made it more complex
because you have a lot of redundancy and

71
00:04:01,221 --> 00:04:04,040
other things built in
to make it last so long.

72
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:07,760
Famously, the one of those two
labs you were talking about, the,

73
00:04:07,761 --> 00:04:11,590
the sample analysis at Mars
or Sam Instrument, um, I
think it was rich, Rick Welsh,

74
00:04:11,591 --> 00:04:15,550
you pointed out that that instrument
alone is larger than the entire chassis of

75
00:04:15,551 --> 00:04:16,680
the Mars exploration rovers.

76
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:20,140
That's right. Yeah. And it's
big. It's heavier than the
sojourner rover was. I mean,

77
00:04:20,141 --> 00:04:22,100
it's the size of a
microwave, which, you know,

78
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:25,300
in Earth terms for laboratory instrument,
it's amazingly miniature.

79
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:29,470
But in terms of what a mobile rover has
to support on the surface of another

80
00:04:29,471 --> 00:04:32,080
planet,
it's enormous and has high power demands.

81
00:04:32,081 --> 00:04:34,840
It has exacting temperature
requirements and it's just,

82
00:04:34,841 --> 00:04:36,760
it's a very complicated
piece of machinery.

83
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:39,950
I think that might be the size of the
entire first rover that we said. Yeah,

84
00:04:39,951 --> 00:04:43,160
sojourner, it's what Sam is the size of
sojourner, bigger than the chassis of,

85
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:47,480
of the Mars exploration
rovers. Um, uh, so, uh, you,

86
00:04:47,481 --> 00:04:50,180
you did an enormous amount of
research at it. It shows any,

87
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,090
it pays off really well in
this book. This, by the way,
is the first technically,

88
00:04:53,091 --> 00:04:56,090
or I've run a lot of tech or technically
oriented books in my life and this is

89
00:04:56,091 --> 00:04:59,670
the first technically oriented book that
I've read that uses terms like stubborn

90
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:02,480
gunk. I think it does a very
good job of kind of like making,

91
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:06,860
making these very complicated things
accessible to a lay audience. Um,

92
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:09,770
uh, and that's kind of an
outgrowth of the work that you do.

93
00:05:09,771 --> 00:05:11,120
You are the senior planetary,

94
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:13,820
a senior editor and planetary
evangelists at the planetary society.

95
00:05:13,821 --> 00:05:15,460
Do you see this as kind of
an outgrowth of that? Right?

96
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,070
Oh, absolutely. Yeah. So yeah. So, ah,

97
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:22,130
I see what I do at the planetary society
as kind of a translation function.

98
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,370
There's so many exciting things happening
in science and engineering and space

99
00:05:25,371 --> 00:05:28,460
exploration right now. Um, and uh,

100
00:05:28,461 --> 00:05:31,640
while I was a grad student exploring
these things, I thought, you know,

101
00:05:31,641 --> 00:05:33,920
this stuff is really cool
but nobody learns about it.

102
00:05:33,921 --> 00:05:36,530
And one of the main reasons that
nobody learns about is that the,

103
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:39,950
the ways that scientists and engineers
communicate with each other are really

104
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:43,590
frankly kind of horrible. Science
papers are just bad. They're,

105
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:48,350
they're boringly written. Um,
they're difficult to understand.

106
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:50,930
But when you train as a
scientist or engineer,

107
00:05:50,931 --> 00:05:54,590
you learn that language and you become
capable of reading it and understanding

108
00:05:54,591 --> 00:05:56,010
it.
And um,

109
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:59,840
you learn to use a whole new vocabulary
of terms that have very specific and

110
00:05:59,841 --> 00:06:00,800
precise meanings.

111
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:03,980
But when you use that same language
to speak to a member of the public,

112
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:07,460
you are basically speaking a language
that's foreign to that member of the

113
00:06:07,461 --> 00:06:09,740
public. So you have to
translate. And it's not,

114
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:13,580
one of the phrases that I hate the most
in public communication is dumbing down

115
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:18,770
because you are not a,
you're not making things stupider.

116
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:23,210
You are translating to a language that
you can use to communicate with other

117
00:06:23,211 --> 00:06:27,920
people. And so it's perfectly
possible to get across, um,

118
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:31,700
complicated concepts. You just have to
use the words that people can understand.

119
00:06:31,701 --> 00:06:33,530
So when I need to write
about stubborn gunk,

120
00:06:33,531 --> 00:06:36,770
I write about stubborn gunk because
that's exactly what we're talking about.

121
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:40,400
We're talking about material
that is sticking to the
sides of an instrument that

122
00:06:40,401 --> 00:06:44,000
you can't get off even by shaking
it. And that's, that's what, uh,

123
00:06:44,001 --> 00:06:47,030
the Phoenix lander was dealing with in
the section that I wrote that about.

124
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:50,630
And it, you know, you've all dealt with
that problem in your own homes and lives.

125
00:06:50,631 --> 00:06:54,440
I'm quite sure. And, and it's just, it's
better to write about it in that way.

126
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:59,390
It's more exciting. It is just as
effective at communicating as saying,

127
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:02,110
I dunno, high viscosity material, um,

128
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:05,870
that has adsorbed onto the walls of the
sample collection device or something

129
00:07:05,871 --> 00:07:09,540
like that. You know, you could say
it that way, but why? I wonder if it,

130
00:07:09,541 --> 00:07:12,900
instead of dumbing down, we can say
that this is a smarting down the rover,

131
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:15,770
just a translation.
It's a translation of,

132
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:20,500
of how everything works to make it more
accessible to uh, uh, to the speakers of,

133
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:23,890
uh, to, uh, to people who are non native
speakers of science. Right. And you're,

134
00:07:23,891 --> 00:07:26,290
and you're well positioned to do that
having trained as a scientist yourself.

135
00:07:26,291 --> 00:07:28,160
That's, that's also your
background. Yeah. Yes, yes.

136
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:31,610
I'm a planetary geologist
by training, so I as an, um,

137
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:33,970
as an Undergrad I did feel geology.

138
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:37,780
I got to walk around on mountains and
whack things with rock hammers and draw a

139
00:07:37,781 --> 00:07:41,020
pencil and colored a colored
pencil maps and things.

140
00:07:41,021 --> 00:07:45,940
And then in Grad school I studied geology
on Venus using radar images from the

141
00:07:45,941 --> 00:07:50,740
Magellan orbiter, which is just, it's such
an underappreciated mission. It's, um,

142
00:07:50,741 --> 00:07:55,000
it ended in the early nineties.
It mapped all of Venus in,

143
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:58,400
in radar wave lengths. And Venus has
a fascinating looking planet and like,

144
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:01,150
I really wish now, so I would get
a mission back there sometime soon.

145
00:08:01,151 --> 00:08:01,984
But it's hard.

146
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:06,820
It's hard to study because of the insanely
high temperatures and the sulfuric

147
00:08:06,821 --> 00:08:10,480
acid clouds and the temperature.
The pressure at the surface is the same.

148
00:08:10,481 --> 00:08:11,920
Is that a mile beneath the ocean?

149
00:08:11,921 --> 00:08:15,650
So it's tough to build hardware that
survives for very long on Venus. Yeah.

150
00:08:15,651 --> 00:08:19,130
I wouldn't want to be the guy who tries
to design the rover that can rove around

151
00:08:19,131 --> 00:08:22,660
where temperatures will melt. We'll land.
Yes. It doesn't seem like fun. Yeah.

152
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:24,750
Solder is not gonna work.
Right.

153
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:29,240
And the Russians succeeded in exploring
the surface of Venus by essentially

154
00:08:29,241 --> 00:08:31,790
building a,
I mean it's an exaggeration,

155
00:08:31,791 --> 00:08:35,240
but they were basically
clockwork spacecraft. I mean,
they were mechanical. Yeah.

156
00:08:35,730 --> 00:08:39,000
Craft. Because you can build mechanical
components that can work at very high

157
00:08:39,001 --> 00:08:40,710
temperatures.
Electronics,

158
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:45,390
especially in the 1970s we're not ready
to operate at those kinds of conditions.

159
00:08:45,391 --> 00:08:49,830
And the Russians being the Russians
built these big robust spacecraft that

160
00:08:49,831 --> 00:08:53,400
basically worked with these mechanical
systems and we're able to take

161
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:58,470
measurements after on the surface for
a matter of minutes to an hour or so

162
00:08:58,471 --> 00:08:59,700
before the spacecraft failed.

163
00:08:59,701 --> 00:09:01,830
And that's how we know anything
about the surface of Venus.

164
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:06,320
Um, so, uh, so, so we're turning
our attention to Mars. Um,

165
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:10,290
one of the things I think you do really
well in this book, um, uh, which,

166
00:09:10,291 --> 00:09:14,420
which I greatly enjoyed
reading and enthusiastically
recommend by the way. Um, uh,

167
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:17,070
one of the things I think you really,
really do well in this book is you, you,

168
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:21,270
you don't just translate all of the
technical jargon and terms that people can

169
00:09:21,271 --> 00:09:24,030
understand, but you also recognize,
and this is again, part of your,

170
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:26,760
your work at the planetary
society. I think, um,

171
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:29,580
that you can't talk about
this rover just as a machine.

172
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:31,800
It's not just at the rover is a machine.

173
00:09:31,801 --> 00:09:35,760
It's that the rover like carries with
it a lot of human hopes and ambitions.

174
00:09:35,761 --> 00:09:38,520
And I think you've kind of communicate
that as well as is what we're,

175
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:41,310
we're hoping and dreaming to
explore on surface of Mars.

176
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:43,110
Yeah. There's a, um,

177
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:47,130
there's a book that was written actually
by a sociologist by the name Jennifer

178
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:50,910
TC,
who has embedded with several of NASA,

179
00:09:50,911 --> 00:09:54,660
has a jps operations
teams on space missions.

180
00:09:54,661 --> 00:09:59,400
And she studies the sociology of how teams
work when they work on these missions.

181
00:09:59,401 --> 00:10:02,610
And one of the most striking things that
she observed that really made me sit

182
00:10:02,611 --> 00:10:07,020
back and go, Huh, is the
the Pronoun that um, uh,

183
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:10,920
that JPL engineers and scientists use
when they refer to the rover. You know,

184
00:10:10,921 --> 00:10:13,620
it's sometimes, uh, some people do say it,

185
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:18,800
it can be traditional to call ships of
exploration. She like, you know, uh,

186
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:21,780
ocean going ships are often
referred to as she, but that's,

187
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:25,230
it's not actually very common to
use that Pronoun for curiosity.

188
00:10:25,231 --> 00:10:30,030
The most common pronoun is we. And so
think about that for a, for a minute.

189
00:10:30,031 --> 00:10:33,240
What it means to be referring
to this machine as we,

190
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,260
it means that we are exploring Mars.
We drilled today,

191
00:10:37,261 --> 00:10:41,850
we are driving across that hill.
It's, it's not just one machine,

192
00:10:41,851 --> 00:10:45,990
it's the embodiment of all of the people
participating together on this mission.

193
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,420
And it's,
it's such a team thing,

194
00:10:48,421 --> 00:10:52,230
especially because of the way that there
were all these operational roles on the

195
00:10:52,231 --> 00:10:56,400
mission and many different people who
can fill those operational roles on any,

196
00:10:56,490 --> 00:11:00,920
on any given day. So it
feels more like, um, I dunno,

197
00:11:00,921 --> 00:11:03,930
I feel it feels kind of
like, uh, um, uh, being on a,

198
00:11:03,931 --> 00:11:06,900
on a ship on the ocean in a
way where there is a captain,

199
00:11:06,901 --> 00:11:11,070
but there's all these other commanders
and everything else and every person has

200
00:11:11,071 --> 00:11:12,900
their part to contribute to make it going.

201
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:15,820
And together you're on this
great ship of exploration.

202
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:19,990
That's what curiosity fuels like.
And so it,

203
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:24,840
it kind of feels like there's a false
dichotomy between human and robotic

204
00:11:24,841 --> 00:11:27,570
exploration because this is
human exploration, right?

205
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:30,000
We are seeing the surface of Mars.

206
00:11:30,001 --> 00:11:34,290
We're exploring places that humans could
never go, or at least not now. And, uh,

207
00:11:34,291 --> 00:11:38,400
we're doing it through the eyes of robots.
And I think that, um, you know, as,

208
00:11:38,401 --> 00:11:43,401
as virtual reality gets more commonplace
as we decreased the separation between

209
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:48,300
humans and the machines and
the software that we use,

210
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:51,990
we're actually going to see a merging of
human and robotic exploration where we

211
00:11:51,991 --> 00:11:55,090
may have human exploration
of the surface of Venus,

212
00:11:55,091 --> 00:11:58,590
except that it will be humans and an
orbiting spacecraft using robotic avatar

213
00:11:58,591 --> 00:12:01,630
has to explore the surface. And it
sound science. Fictiony but it's not,

214
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:06,160
it's really not that farfetched given
current technology and would be a much

215
00:12:06,161 --> 00:12:10,810
more efficient way for us to
get human brains into surf,

216
00:12:10,811 --> 00:12:14,440
into rope,
into environments that are really hard to,

217
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:19,000
for humans to survive. Terrible
radiation environment's terrible heat,

218
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,000
a crushing pressure. Um, you
know, all of those things.

219
00:12:22,001 --> 00:12:24,000
We just put robot bodies
down there and we'd say,

220
00:12:24,001 --> 00:12:26,890
if we can manage to use our human
brains effectively, then, then that's,

221
00:12:26,891 --> 00:12:28,300
I think the future of exploration.

222
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,220
Right. And then you haven't
gone down into the gravity well,

223
00:12:30,221 --> 00:12:33,080
and so you don't have to get the people
boosted back off the post so that you

224
00:12:33,081 --> 00:12:35,870
can land the humans on Phobos or
something and having, you know,

225
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:38,540
telling operating a mission
on the surface below them.

226
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:42,270
Yeah. It turns out to be harder to do.
Aereo synchronis orbits, that's Mars.

227
00:12:42,271 --> 00:12:44,190
Geosynchronous orbits the earth.

228
00:12:44,191 --> 00:12:48,810
Geosynchronous orbits because Maurice has
gravity fueled is a lot lumpier and so

229
00:12:48,811 --> 00:12:52,320
it's hard to keep you to do station
keeping with your spacecraft to keep it

230
00:12:52,321 --> 00:12:57,240
positioned over the one, um,
at over a single spot on Mars.

231
00:12:57,241 --> 00:12:59,920
But there are like two stable positions.
Um,

232
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,830
in longitude or met a stable position.

233
00:13:01,831 --> 00:13:04,710
So you have to like really want to
explore the part of Mars that's underneath

234
00:13:04,711 --> 00:13:07,110
those two table positions.
Yeah.

235
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:11,430
So you were talking about the way that,
um, that we embody the rover, right? That,

236
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,140
that we are the rover and the,
the, the language that's used.

237
00:13:14,141 --> 00:13:16,970
But another thing that, uh, Janet
for Tessie pointed out was that,

238
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:20,440
that in the same way as
we embody the rover, uh,

239
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:24,190
we also use our bodies to communicate
about the rover. And so like for example,

240
00:13:24,191 --> 00:13:26,530
with spirit and opportunity,
we'll talk about the solar panels.

241
00:13:26,531 --> 00:13:28,210
By you bend your body forward,

242
00:13:28,211 --> 00:13:31,150
you splay your arms backward in this
position because that's what the solar

243
00:13:31,151 --> 00:13:33,170
panels look like. That's when
you talk about the solar panels.

244
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,230
You do that when you talk
about the mobility system,

245
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:37,660
you kind of move your arms in
this characteristic way, right?

246
00:13:37,661 --> 00:13:40,870
And steer the wheels like
this. Um, and, and you,

247
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:42,050
when you talk about the robotic arm,
you,

248
00:13:42,051 --> 00:13:45,550
you use your arm and it's always the
left arm because their left arm. Um, uh,

249
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,710
did you find yourself doing that
when you're writing this book?

250
00:13:47,711 --> 00:13:50,320
Did you kind of inhabit the rover,
the rover, his body that way?

251
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:51,960
I did that a little bit,

252
00:13:51,961 --> 00:13:55,340
but I actually find myself doing it a
lot less with curiosity than I do with

253
00:13:55,341 --> 00:13:57,960
spirit and opportunity. Everybody
else does too. Yeah. So spirit,

254
00:13:57,961 --> 00:13:59,910
spirit and opportunity, you have this, um,

255
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:03,540
they're much more human scale
and there's some metrical,

256
00:14:03,541 --> 00:14:08,541
it's much more easy to imagine them has
having the body plan of a person or a

257
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:12,990
donkey or a dog or whatever you want
to imagine it. Curiosity is, um,

258
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:18,390
it's, uh, you know, it's not nearly as
symmetrical. It's not nearly as pretty.

259
00:14:18,391 --> 00:14:19,320
And,
and to be honest,

260
00:14:19,321 --> 00:14:22,830
I really didn't like the appearance of
curiosity when I first started doing the

261
00:14:22,831 --> 00:14:25,260
research on this book. I
often feel like, you know,

262
00:14:25,261 --> 00:14:28,320
there's these three generations
of rovers. There's, um, a store,

263
00:14:28,370 --> 00:14:30,720
sojourner spirit and
opportunity and curiosity.

264
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:34,410
And I feel like sojourner was sort of a
loyal little dog that it couldn't ever

265
00:14:34,411 --> 00:14:37,140
go any farther out of sight of the
lander because it didn't have its own

266
00:14:37,141 --> 00:14:39,850
communication skills.
So it just kind of poked around a rock.

267
00:14:39,851 --> 00:14:41,280
So you could even see these images of it,

268
00:14:41,281 --> 00:14:44,750
like lifting his leg on a rock because
it like drives up and it kept driving and

269
00:14:44,751 --> 00:14:45,120
it,

270
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,210
and there's actually an image of the rover
like perched right almost sideways on

271
00:14:48,211 --> 00:14:53,000
a rock like this. Um, and then spirit and
are much more surefooted. They're bigger,

272
00:14:53,001 --> 00:14:56,690
they're more human scale. So I, in
my extended animal metaphor there,

273
00:14:56,691 --> 00:14:58,750
the boroughs that used to,
or the donkeys,

274
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:02,690
it used to accompany the
western geologists as they
explore the geology and in

275
00:15:02,691 --> 00:15:05,750
the American West. And then so what
does that make curiosity? Well,

276
00:15:05,751 --> 00:15:09,560
it's the animal design by committee.
It's a camel to ship of the desert.

277
00:15:09,890 --> 00:15:13,850
It moves slowly and steadily across
the desert landscape, you know,

278
00:15:13,851 --> 00:15:17,360
carrying its load, lumbering
load with it. And, uh,

279
00:15:17,361 --> 00:15:19,430
and that's what curiosity is like.
And like I said,

280
00:15:19,431 --> 00:15:24,050
I didn't really love it when I first saw
the design, but that change actually,

281
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,990
um, the JPL had a moment, um,

282
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:31,280
had an opportunity for the media to come
into the clean room and see curiosity

283
00:15:31,281 --> 00:15:33,410
before it got shipped
to Florida for launch.

284
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:36,470
And so I was actually able to put on
all the, they call it a bunny suit,

285
00:15:36,471 --> 00:15:40,610
the white suit and the cap and everything
else and go in and see curiosity,

286
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:41,600
fate face to face.

287
00:15:41,601 --> 00:15:44,060
And I have to say that I kind of fell
in love with curiosity when I had the

288
00:15:44,061 --> 00:15:48,620
opportunity to sit there and a, and
meet it face to face. But yeah, I don't,

289
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:53,350
I don't feel like I embody curiosity
nearly as much because it's,

290
00:15:53,351 --> 00:15:57,850
it's so ungainly it's a different
kind of creature from a spirit,

291
00:15:57,851 --> 00:15:58,684
an opportunity.

292
00:15:58,930 --> 00:16:00,290
And,
and that,

293
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,730
that seems to be kind of widespread
on the product to Washington facade.

294
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:05,460
I talks about, about data,
about how people have, have,

295
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:08,850
he feels like people have emotionally
connected with curiosity less than with

296
00:16:08,851 --> 00:16:10,800
spirit and opportunity.
Um,

297
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:13,020
I think also it's a,

298
00:16:13,021 --> 00:16:17,970
it may partly be because of the way
that the spirit and opportunity are much

299
00:16:17,971 --> 00:16:22,140
more, um, uh, responsive in a way.
They, you come in on a morning,

300
00:16:22,141 --> 00:16:23,640
you plan the day and then that's it.

301
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:28,320
Whereas curiosity has to be planned by
committees as well, where you have, um,

302
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:33,120
act as many as four parallel planning
processes that are happening at the same

303
00:16:33,121 --> 00:16:35,310
time operating on different timescales.

304
00:16:35,311 --> 00:16:39,840
You do have a tactical operations team
that is planning everyday of operations,

305
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:43,470
but then there's a look ahead planning
team that is planning a couple of days of

306
00:16:43,471 --> 00:16:44,310
operations.

307
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:47,730
There's a longterm planning team that's
looking at months and then there's a

308
00:16:47,731 --> 00:16:50,730
project science group that is kind
of keeping track of all of the,

309
00:16:50,731 --> 00:16:55,410
the mission requirements and um,
unlike spirit and opportunity,

310
00:16:55,560 --> 00:17:00,300
most of the decisions for curiosity
get made many more days in advance.

311
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:03,900
So it's, it's much less
responsive. So it feels in a way,

312
00:17:03,901 --> 00:17:08,880
a lot more like some of the other big
NASA missions like Cassini or these other

313
00:17:08,881 --> 00:17:11,490
things that need to be planned
in much longer in advance.

314
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,620
Yeah, that's, it's, it's kind
of this weird hybrid, right,

315
00:17:13,621 --> 00:17:17,160
where we're for that and for also for
project management reasons because it has

316
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:20,460
like lots of pis for the different
instruments instead of one pie overseeing

317
00:17:20,461 --> 00:17:23,400
them all as on spirit opportunity.
And so there's,

318
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:26,220
there's this kind of council of,
of monarchs

319
00:17:27,770 --> 00:17:31,450
kind of content council of elders.
Yeah. It's, it's all men by the way,

320
00:17:31,451 --> 00:17:36,290
which I hate really bad. So
there's this group of like 12, um,

321
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:40,180
pis and they're all men. There's a lot
of awesome women working on this team.

322
00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:41,040
But yeah,

323
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:44,130
a lot of great engineers working on a team
and I'm working on operations as well.

324
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:47,430
Um, and in fact, that was
one of the things I was going
to ask you about was, um,

325
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:51,330
uh, you know, you, you cite some of those
women in the book. Um, some of them,

326
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,110
the woman who designed the soft spot,
for example,

327
00:17:53,111 --> 00:17:57,330
of the sample acquisition at
handling system. Um, are you
hoping that, uh, you know,

328
00:17:57,370 --> 00:17:58,410
as, as, as,

329
00:17:58,411 --> 00:18:01,800
as you are well known for your kind of
science outreach or also well known as

330
00:18:01,801 --> 00:18:05,070
being an advocate of women in science
and engineering? And Are you hoping that,

331
00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:05,580
you know,

332
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:08,130
one of the many effects of this book
will be to encourage women to go into

333
00:18:08,131 --> 00:18:10,020
science and engineering to see
if there's a role for them?

334
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:13,200
I don't see it work. I
don't think that that's, uh,

335
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:16,620
something that I see coming as an outcome
of this book. I think the book is,

336
00:18:16,621 --> 00:18:20,880
you know, designed to feed
people's insatiable curiosity
about what curiosity is.

337
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:24,510
Right. Um, and honestly, you know,
as a parent of two daughters,

338
00:18:24,511 --> 00:18:27,180
I don't see any problems with the number
of women who want to go into science

339
00:18:27,181 --> 00:18:30,020
edition. Yeah, sure. It's weather science
and engineering wants to keep them there.

340
00:18:30,050 --> 00:18:31,700
Really.
Ultimately it's,

341
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:36,830
these missions are really hard because
they operate when you first land on Mars,

342
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:42,810
the amount of time you spend,
um,

343
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:45,960
just continuous hours working
on these missions. It's just,

344
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:49,890
it's kind of nightmarish
and I don't really go into
that that much in this book.

345
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:54,780
If you're interested in books were kind
of the life of being on a mission is

346
00:18:54,781 --> 00:18:55,800
central.
You can read,

347
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:58,860
there's another recently published book
by Alan Stern and David Grinspoon called

348
00:18:58,861 --> 00:19:01,890
chasing new horizons. It's about
the new horizons mission to Pluto.

349
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:03,780
And at every stage of that mission,

350
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:06,030
it was like we thought
we were rolling before,

351
00:19:06,031 --> 00:19:07,590
but we had to get even more all in.

352
00:19:07,591 --> 00:19:11,190
And then I just started working 16 hours
a day and getting by on three hours of

353
00:19:11,191 --> 00:19:15,240
sleep. And it's like the four Yorkshire
men sketch right from money python.

354
00:19:15,241 --> 00:19:16,860
It just keeps on getting worse and worse.

355
00:19:16,861 --> 00:19:19,260
And You wonder how people
can last like this.

356
00:19:19,261 --> 00:19:22,740
And people with families can't last
like that for very long, you know?

357
00:19:22,741 --> 00:19:26,070
So you have primarily young
people working on missions, um,

358
00:19:26,071 --> 00:19:28,020
at least on tactical operations.
It's just,

359
00:19:28,021 --> 00:19:31,440
it's difficult now over
time on a mission like this,

360
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:34,650
they did what they were able to
change the operational structure.

361
00:19:34,651 --> 00:19:37,110
So first after about,
um,

362
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:40,500
after 90 days they went off of Mars time.
Um,

363
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:45,560
so Mars time is where you set your
clock to the rotational rate of Mars,

364
00:19:45,871 --> 00:19:48,840
which has days, 40 minutes longer
than earth days. And Scott,

365
00:19:48,841 --> 00:19:53,430
you're always my example of the Weirdo
who loves Mars time because like if you

366
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:56,310
are a person who's like a
night owl with no children,

367
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:57,330
you have children now of course.

368
00:19:57,331 --> 00:20:01,380
But if you are a night owl
with no children and you
love to sleep in what's not

369
00:20:01,381 --> 00:20:04,410
to love about sleeping in 40 minutes
later every day and it sounds great,

370
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:09,210
but like if you have any connection
with the rest of humanity as totally

371
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:12,330
miserable,
if you have children who have,

372
00:20:12,331 --> 00:20:15,090
or a spouse or partner who has,

373
00:20:15,091 --> 00:20:17,670
who wants to like see you
during ordinary daylight hours,

374
00:20:17,671 --> 00:20:19,980
it's absolutely miserable. It's
also kind of dangerous. You know,

375
00:20:19,981 --> 00:20:21,690
I was on Mars time,
um,

376
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:25,590
with spirit and opportunity for a little
while and because the schedule slips

377
00:20:25,591 --> 00:20:28,800
around the clock, you wind
up, I'm sleep deprived,

378
00:20:28,801 --> 00:20:33,801
driving home after being up all night
during morning rush hour or an empty

379
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:36,810
highways and you fall asleep while
driving and get into a wreck.

380
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:39,660
And Steve Squyres has actually really
concerned about this and did all kinds of

381
00:20:39,661 --> 00:20:42,990
training for the operations team
before the mission started. But anyway,

382
00:20:42,991 --> 00:20:46,410
after 90 days they knew this mission
was a marathon, not a sprint.

383
00:20:47,030 --> 00:20:49,520
They quickly went off of Mars time.
Um,

384
00:20:49,570 --> 00:20:52,720
after 180 days they stopped
working on Sundays. Um,

385
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:55,450
after another 90 days they
stopped working on Saturdays.

386
00:20:55,451 --> 00:20:57,790
And what that means is that it
really builds up your Friday,

387
00:20:57,791 --> 00:21:02,050
you have to produce a three sol plan,
a three day plan on a Friday.

388
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:05,050
And sometimes it means that you're not
taking advantage of the full capability

389
00:21:05,051 --> 00:21:07,750
of the rover. But they did do, um,

390
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:10,180
they do clever things like
some of these instruments,

391
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:15,100
like the Sam Instrument has to cook
samples in an oven that is tremendously

392
00:21:15,101 --> 00:21:15,970
power demanding.

393
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:19,960
So you might say cook them in an oven on
a Saturday and just take Sunday off to

394
00:21:19,961 --> 00:21:22,810
let the batteries recharged because
the rover would have to do that anyway.

395
00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:25,990
So you might as well do it at a time
when you don't want to double up on your

396
00:21:25,991 --> 00:21:26,824
planning.

397
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:30,940
And so over time they have actually
managed to get the operations requirement

398
00:21:30,941 --> 00:21:34,990
down to about nine hours a day.
It's still a little bit long workday,

399
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:37,870
they still do kind of play
with a calendar a bit.

400
00:21:37,871 --> 00:21:40,240
So sometimes you have to
come in and work at like six,

401
00:21:40,241 --> 00:21:44,920
7:00 AM because that's when you need to
get the commands up to the rover before

402
00:21:44,921 --> 00:21:48,700
2:00 PM or whatever it is. Sometimes you
have to come in late, but they still,

403
00:21:48,730 --> 00:21:53,730
now they allow everybody to have a good
night's sleep except for the poor Kim

404
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:58,060
Kam team. Kim Kam is one of the
instruments and it's operated from France.

405
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:01,740
So now that they're on earth time,
um,

406
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:05,620
the poor Kim Cam team primarily
works overnight and it's
kind of misery for them,

407
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:10,150
but they trade off. There's only, they
work into operational roles over time.

408
00:22:10,151 --> 00:22:13,810
Like they might have two days on ops
per week and then the rest of the week

409
00:22:13,811 --> 00:22:16,210
they're not an option and they
don't have to do that schedule.

410
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:21,490
And so I find that as these missions
go on, you'll find a lot of,

411
00:22:21,491 --> 00:22:26,290
I'm older, I'm a lot more women of
people coming into operations cause the,

412
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:31,350
the what the work time is
much more predictable and
it's much easier to balance

413
00:22:31,631 --> 00:22:34,210
it with all the other obligations
you may have in your daily life.

414
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:37,900
So do you, you're appointed about families
on Mars time. You'll remember that, uh,

415
00:22:37,910 --> 00:22:42,430
when uh, curiosity landed, there was
an engineer, David Oh. Um, who, uh,

416
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:46,930
he and his wife and their two kids
all went on Mars time together. Um,

417
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:50,050
because the kids didn't have to be back
in school for a month or month and a

418
00:22:50,051 --> 00:22:50,621
half or something like that.

419
00:22:50,621 --> 00:22:52,570
And so they all just all went on Mars
time and they were all living at the whole

420
00:22:52,571 --> 00:22:54,790
family was living on Mars time. What is
the first of those that I've heard of?

421
00:22:54,890 --> 00:22:55,090
Yeah.

422
00:22:55,090 --> 00:22:58,390
Yeah. And they had a blog about that
doesn't work for everybody all the time.

423
00:22:58,570 --> 00:22:59,231
It was actually great.

424
00:22:59,231 --> 00:23:01,960
They talked about what can you do
in Los Angeles with two children,

425
00:23:01,961 --> 00:23:03,820
young children at midnight at,

426
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:07,630
and they found all kinds of interesting
why walks they could do with lights and

427
00:23:07,631 --> 00:23:10,690
things like that was actually a pretty
cool going to the beach at like, you know,

428
00:23:10,691 --> 00:23:13,360
overnight is really interesting.
And so they had a good time.

429
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:17,260
They saw lots of interest in wildlife
and they went to various all night

430
00:23:17,261 --> 00:23:19,750
restaurants at the kids love. So they
actually had a good time with that.

431
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:21,251
So,
um,

432
00:23:21,251 --> 00:23:26,110
so you studied all the instruments on
curiosity in excruciating detail for this

433
00:23:26,111 --> 00:23:30,670
book. Um, uh, in that process,
did you come out with a favorite?

434
00:23:30,671 --> 00:23:31,590
What's your favorite instrument?

435
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:35,550
Oh, I never have favorites.
Um, but she lied. But go ahead.

436
00:23:35,810 --> 00:23:38,140
I do have to say that,
that Molly is pretty cool.

437
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:39,870
Molly's are really cool instruments.

438
00:23:39,871 --> 00:23:43,660
So Molly stands for the Mars
Hand Lens imager. It's Maa Hli.

439
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:47,990
It's the camera that's on the
end of the robotic arm. And, um,

440
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:51,830
for reasons that I go into
exhaustive detail on in the book,

441
00:23:51,831 --> 00:23:56,120
it turns out to be the widest angle camp
color camera also that the rover has.

442
00:23:56,300 --> 00:24:00,410
So I can take the broadest
views and because it's on
the arm, you know, they can,

443
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:05,540
the whole point of it is to take
images of um, targets that they do.

444
00:24:05,541 --> 00:24:07,280
They're in situ work on
with their instruments.

445
00:24:07,281 --> 00:24:10,580
And so they'll use Molly to take an
image from about a foot away and then

446
00:24:10,581 --> 00:24:13,550
they'll zoom in and take one from about
five centimeters away and then another

447
00:24:13,551 --> 00:24:15,860
one from about to one
or two centimeters away.

448
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:18,670
And that gets you a nested set of images,
um,

449
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:23,780
at increasing resolution that helps
you see what's going on in the rocks.

450
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:27,470
Um, but because it's a
focus, a little camera,

451
00:24:27,471 --> 00:24:29,180
it can also focus at infinity.

452
00:24:29,210 --> 00:24:32,570
So you can take long distance views and
of course you can turn it back and look

453
00:24:32,571 --> 00:24:36,590
at the rover. And so this is,
it's the first Mars rover, um,

454
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:40,310
to demonstrate capability of
taking a self portrait on Mars.

455
00:24:40,311 --> 00:24:43,820
Although notably opportunity recently
took a self portrait on Mars.

456
00:24:44,090 --> 00:24:47,420
It too has a, um, are mounted camera.

457
00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:51,320
It's camera is not focused [inaudible]
so the images that it took of itself,

458
00:24:51,321 --> 00:24:55,010
we're very blurry but it's
still unmistakably the rover
and it was really quite

459
00:24:55,011 --> 00:24:56,630
a thrill to see that.
But yeah,

460
00:24:56,631 --> 00:25:01,010
it's become part of standard operating
procedure for curiosity to take a selfie

461
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:02,720
whenever it's at a drill site.

462
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:07,190
And so we have these self portraits of
curiosity across the surface of Mars and

463
00:25:07,191 --> 00:25:09,080
you can see it getting increasingly dusty.

464
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:14,240
The one that you're seeing on the screen
up here is a special one where um,

465
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:15,260
the,

466
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:19,280
the first self portrait actually that
curiosity took was just of the wheels on

467
00:25:19,281 --> 00:25:20,114
the surface.

468
00:25:20,330 --> 00:25:23,690
And you want to do that so that you
can check and see how the wheels are

469
00:25:23,691 --> 00:25:27,110
contacting the surface check and see
the condition of the wheels after the

470
00:25:27,111 --> 00:25:31,940
landing. Um, and they, uh,
you know, after they did that,

471
00:25:31,941 --> 00:25:34,880
they, in order to do that they
have to have the, the arm very low,

472
00:25:34,881 --> 00:25:36,890
obviously underneath the
undercarriage of the rover.

473
00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:42,190
Most of the selfies are shot at an
altitude that's similar to the altitude of

474
00:25:42,351 --> 00:25:46,400
the mass cam cameras. So
that they're, it's, it's you
know, taking a self portrait.

475
00:25:46,610 --> 00:25:50,750
But this one, they were
actually at a drill site where
the ground slope downward,

476
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:54,440
which made life actually quite
difficult for the drill team.

477
00:25:54,890 --> 00:25:57,380
But because the ground was sloping
downward away from the rover,

478
00:25:57,381 --> 00:26:00,770
they were able to turn the turret
and take a full selfie from that low

479
00:26:00,771 --> 00:26:05,600
perspective. So that's what gives you
this very low perspective on the rover.

480
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:08,960
And those self portraits are cool.
And the um,

481
00:26:09,290 --> 00:26:13,220
some people on the science team or
on an engineering team were dubious.

482
00:26:13,221 --> 00:26:14,630
But when the,
the Molly,

483
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:19,680
a principal investigator and a couple of
the workers on that mission a simulated

484
00:26:20,601 --> 00:26:23,300
what it could look like and showed it
to the engineering team, they were like,

485
00:26:23,301 --> 00:26:24,740
oh my God,
we have to do this.

486
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:28,100
And so like with everything they have to
do it on earth before they can do it on

487
00:26:28,101 --> 00:26:32,420
Mars. And so the first selfie was
actually taken by the earth copy,

488
00:26:32,421 --> 00:26:35,090
the earth twin of curiosity.
Inside.

489
00:26:35,091 --> 00:26:39,260
It's a little garage in the Mars Yard
at JPL and you can see there's two

490
00:26:39,261 --> 00:26:41,200
engineers in the background.
One of them is vandever event.

491
00:26:41,210 --> 00:26:45,960
She's like around the corner and it's the,
um, as the camera image is being taken,

492
00:26:45,961 --> 00:26:48,390
it's pretty cool. Yeah, I was a, I was,

493
00:26:48,430 --> 00:26:51,600
I am surprised that you said the Molly
was your favorite because everybody,

494
00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:52,320
when they,
when they,

495
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:55,470
when you asked what their favorite
instrument on the on curiosity is,

496
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:58,500
everybody always has to laser
cause Qpp people come on,

497
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:02,760
it's a rover with a fricking laser beam
on and say exactly what's not to love

498
00:27:02,761 --> 00:27:06,270
about that. Exactly. And actually,
so it is kind of fun. There's,

499
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:10,290
there's very imaginative, um, artwork.
So, you know, curiosity happening,

500
00:27:10,291 --> 00:27:10,891
various things.

501
00:27:10,891 --> 00:27:14,940
My favorite one actually is one
that I first saw in a cam cam team.

502
00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:17,760
Kim Cam is the instrument
that has a laser. Um,

503
00:27:17,790 --> 00:27:22,790
they were doing a team presentation at a
science meeting and they had a photo of

504
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:28,040
curiosity shooting a laser and a full on
Michael Bay explosions happening at the

505
00:27:28,171 --> 00:27:32,280
end of the laser. And you're
like, oh yeah. So no, it's um,

506
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:34,560
I just, I like pictures. What can I say?

507
00:27:34,561 --> 00:27:37,110
Pictures tell a stories and I
really like the Molly pictures.

508
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:40,720
One thing Kim Kim has though is
it does have a camera on it, um,

509
00:27:40,770 --> 00:27:44,730
for to take context images of where these
app with their laser and later on in

510
00:27:44,731 --> 00:27:48,600
the mission they trained the camera to
be able to focus at infinity so that you

511
00:27:48,601 --> 00:27:53,060
can take a long distance photos and
the Cameron has this circular baffle.

512
00:27:53,061 --> 00:27:57,270
So it's the highest resolution camera
I can take the most distant photos.

513
00:27:57,271 --> 00:28:02,160
So it's just like taking a spyglass and
like seeing these long distance features.

514
00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:04,500
Oh boy. There's that, uh, you know,

515
00:28:04,670 --> 00:28:06,880
fairly network that we were going
to visit in the future. And,

516
00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:09,960
and so I always kind of feel like a
ship's captain every time I see those chem

517
00:28:09,961 --> 00:28:12,180
cam pictures just with clear,

518
00:28:12,181 --> 00:28:13,760
I didn't mean to disagree
with you about the Mollys.

519
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:18,510
I think it's a very strong choice. And
Molly also has a flashlight. Yes. Kim,

520
00:28:18,511 --> 00:28:21,300
my wife who works on the
rovers, uh, on curiosity.

521
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:25,860
That's her favorite is the flashlight. Oh
yeah. There's actually two flashlights.

522
00:28:25,890 --> 00:28:28,890
And the reason for that is because if
you're a geologist working in the field

523
00:28:28,891 --> 00:28:29,730
with your Rock Hammer,

524
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,060
you smash off a piece of fresh rock to
look at the crystals inside and try to

525
00:28:33,061 --> 00:28:35,400
identify what minerals are present you.

526
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:39,900
You'll do this with the rock sample to
try to catch a glance from the sun to see

527
00:28:39,901 --> 00:28:43,110
if there's reflective surfaces and
what the angles are to each other.

528
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:44,820
While curiosity can't do that.

529
00:28:45,030 --> 00:28:48,570
But what it can do is take his two
little flashlights on Molly and go blink,

530
00:28:48,571 --> 00:28:49,760
blink pink, pink thing, blink to,

531
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:52,230
to do lights coming from
two different directions.

532
00:28:52,231 --> 00:28:55,290
And so that's what it does to try to,
to catch a crystal glance.

533
00:28:55,470 --> 00:28:57,610
I don't know that it's
ever worked that way. Um,

534
00:28:57,660 --> 00:29:01,620
but they do use the flashlights at
night because that way they have a light

535
00:29:01,621 --> 00:29:03,930
source of known illumination properties.

536
00:29:04,170 --> 00:29:07,500
And so all the night images that they've
taken of all of their drill sites,

537
00:29:07,501 --> 00:29:10,920
they can compare the color to each other
because they're all taken under exactly

538
00:29:10,921 --> 00:29:14,550
the same illumination conditions.
So in addition to the, uh,

539
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:16,320
the laser on the rover,
uh,

540
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:19,230
I actually learned from your book is not
a thing that I realized before reading

541
00:29:19,231 --> 00:29:21,850
your book, but I learned from
your book that Dan, the data,

542
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:25,880
the dynamic Albido of neutrons
experiment, um, has an eye on cannon. Yes.

543
00:29:25,890 --> 00:29:27,430
We've got a laser and an eye on Kennedy.

544
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:29,780
All we need is a rover with a light
saber and we've got the TRIFECTA.

545
00:29:30,330 --> 00:29:33,660
That's right. Yeah. Yeah. Uh, another,

546
00:29:33,661 --> 00:29:35,660
another really cool thing I learned about,
uh,

547
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:38,970
the science instruments for reading
the book was, um, uh, about the Rad,

548
00:29:38,971 --> 00:29:41,410
which has a scintillating
plastic detector. Yes.

549
00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:42,720
Which I love that name.

550
00:29:42,721 --> 00:29:45,510
I had decided that scintillating plastic
conductor as the name of my music cover

551
00:29:45,511 --> 00:29:46,344
band.

552
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:49,500
Yeah. It's not, there's all kinds of, uh,

553
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:54,210
fun terms and they tend to squeeze
all of these terms into acronyms.

554
00:29:54,211 --> 00:29:58,740
And so you talk about Sam's, tls and QMS
and doing gcms and all of the samples.

555
00:29:58,741 --> 00:30:02,820
And, and I think it's actually a lot
more fun to say Gas Chromatograph Mass

556
00:30:02,821 --> 00:30:06,310
Spectrometer. It sounds like, it sounds
like start start trekkies you know,

557
00:30:06,311 --> 00:30:09,870
and let's send those, let's fire things
up in our oven and send them through the,

558
00:30:09,890 --> 00:30:12,330
um, what does it, the manifolds, the,

559
00:30:12,331 --> 00:30:15,750
there are many manifolds inside Sam and
you stand up with your helium carrier

560
00:30:15,751 --> 00:30:20,190
gas through manifold a and send it off
to the tunable laser spectrometer and see

561
00:30:20,191 --> 00:30:23,340
what that is. It's just fun. It's fun.
There's a lot of, a lot of fun terms. Uh,

562
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:25,520
um, so, uh, so again,

563
00:30:25,521 --> 00:30:29,210
having studied all the instruments and
like this exhaustive detail as you say,

564
00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:34,220
um, which, which of them do you think
was the most complicated instrument? Um,

565
00:30:34,550 --> 00:30:35,590
of all of them on the river?

566
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:38,790
Yeah, that one's easy to answer, but
the first thing I want to answer is,

567
00:30:38,791 --> 00:30:40,770
is like when he says exhaustive detail,

568
00:30:40,771 --> 00:30:44,340
exhaustive is the most common
adjective you use to describe my book.

569
00:30:44,341 --> 00:30:48,030
And I'm just glad that it's not
exhausting, right? Yeah. So, yeah,

570
00:30:48,031 --> 00:30:52,470
so fascinating by the
exhaustive, right. So, um,

571
00:30:52,710 --> 00:30:54,420
uh,
definitely without question,

572
00:30:54,421 --> 00:30:56,580
the most complicated instrument
as the Sam Instrument.

573
00:30:56,581 --> 00:31:00,600
So Sam means sample analysis at Mars.
It's one of two laboratory instruments.

574
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:03,330
And it's interesting that the
two laboratory instruments,

575
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:07,230
one of them is really very
simple. And that's Kevin. It's a,

576
00:31:07,250 --> 00:31:09,430
that's an instrument that it has a,
um,

577
00:31:09,690 --> 00:31:13,710
it has a laser that it shines through
a little sample of powder and it,

578
00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:18,390
it shakes the powder so
that those crystals all toss
around in various different

579
00:31:18,391 --> 00:31:22,440
orientations. And the crystal scatter
the light and you get a diffraction plot.

580
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:26,790
It's the same kind of technology that
I'm Rosalind Franklin used to figure out

581
00:31:26,791 --> 00:31:31,290
the structure of DNA. You're doing x Ray
crystallography basically. And it's, um,

582
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:33,780
and that's all it is.
You take a picture of the,

583
00:31:33,990 --> 00:31:36,780
of the diffraction and then you download
that picture and you can say, oh,

584
00:31:36,781 --> 00:31:41,210
these minerals are present. And that's
it. And that's one of the two, um, uh,

585
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:45,810
laboratory instruments. But then
there, Sam and Sam is ridiculous.

586
00:31:45,811 --> 00:31:49,590
I cannot believe they actually built
this instrument and put it on a rover on

587
00:31:49,591 --> 00:31:51,390
Mars. It has, um,

588
00:31:51,930 --> 00:31:56,250
it has a carousel of more
than 70 little courts cups.

589
00:31:56,520 --> 00:32:00,750
It can rotate this carousel under two
different inlets to receive samples.

590
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:05,730
Then it rotates the carousel and lifts
a cup into an oven. And the oven,

591
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:10,440
it can heat things up to 500 degrees.
It can heat it in steps,

592
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:13,680
it can heat it with a ramp, it can heat
it for a little bit, then hold it or not.

593
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:16,300
It can heat it all the way.
It can heat it part way.

594
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:19,650
It can take it down and do it,
bring it back up again. Um,

595
00:32:19,950 --> 00:32:24,570
and then there is a little helium tank
that takes all of the gases that come off

596
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:29,160
of the oven and sends them into one of
numerous possible different instruments.

597
00:32:29,161 --> 00:32:32,500
But before that it sends them into these
little chambers called manifolds. Um,

598
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:35,510
which are, you know, a manifold is
a place where you have lots of, um,

599
00:32:35,670 --> 00:32:40,250
things intersecting and by opening and
closing one of dozens of different valves,

600
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:43,220
they can send the material onto
different getters and scrubbers,

601
00:32:43,221 --> 00:32:46,310
which takes certain stuff
out of, out of the, um,

602
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:48,830
the gases they can turn,

603
00:32:48,890 --> 00:32:51,650
turn on to get her for a little while
and then heat the getter to release the

604
00:32:51,651 --> 00:32:54,620
stuff again. And then they send that
into one of three different instruments.

605
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:56,360
So there's all these valves,

606
00:32:56,630 --> 00:33:00,680
there's all these different ways
that all these knobs to turn. Um,

607
00:33:01,130 --> 00:33:04,430
they actually developed a, basically
a programming language that they can,

608
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:08,120
that the SAM team can use to send
things through the Sam Instrument.

609
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:10,170
One of the wackiest things
I think is that the,

610
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:14,090
the Pi on the Sam instrument was very
proud of the fact that it's, that he can,

611
00:33:14,110 --> 00:33:18,530
that he programs it had
basic, right. I was like,

612
00:33:19,310 --> 00:33:22,220
I know, I know very little
about programming languages,

613
00:33:22,221 --> 00:33:24,650
but I know enough to know that
that's not something to be proud of.

614
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:29,960
It's not widely used at Google. That's,
yeah, sure. So anyway, it's, um,

615
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:34,850
it's incredibly complicated and to most
people it's just a box that you, um,

616
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:39,470
that the SAM team asks for Knobs to be
turned and they turned the knobs and data

617
00:33:39,471 --> 00:33:42,140
comes out.
And then even once you have the data,

618
00:33:42,141 --> 00:33:44,590
you still don't have answers because,
um,

619
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:47,690
the kinds of things that they're trying
to figure out are so complex that the

620
00:33:47,691 --> 00:33:50,000
only way to be sure that
you figured it out right,

621
00:33:50,270 --> 00:33:55,270
is to create a sample of known composition
and put it through a duplicate of the

622
00:33:56,091 --> 00:33:58,550
instrument in a lab on earth
under Martian conditions.

623
00:33:58,550 --> 00:34:02,420
So that's temperature and
vacuum and it's so San results,

624
00:34:02,421 --> 00:34:06,740
there's actually going to be a press
conference tomorrow concerning a science

625
00:34:06,741 --> 00:34:08,430
paper that,
um,

626
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:11,870
is one of the main people on the
press panel is Paul Mahaffey,

627
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:13,640
who's the principal
investigator on this instrument.

628
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:18,830
And so I'm sure that the paper concerns
data that was taken at least six months

629
00:34:18,831 --> 00:34:19,910
ago,
probably years ago,

630
00:34:20,180 --> 00:34:23,930
because that's just how long it takes
to understand the results from this

631
00:34:23,931 --> 00:34:24,970
instrument.
Uh,

632
00:34:25,250 --> 00:34:28,130
fortunately there are other instruments
that produced much more rapid results

633
00:34:28,131 --> 00:34:31,280
and make things a little more interesting
for those of us following along in the

634
00:34:31,281 --> 00:34:32,040
mission.
Yeah.

635
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:33,540
So Sam instrument has another talent.

636
00:34:33,590 --> 00:34:35,930
If there were a talent
show on Mars curiosity,

637
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:37,440
curiosities entry would be singing.

638
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:41,670
That's right. Sam famously
sang happy birthday to itself
using it. Sam Instrument.

639
00:34:41,671 --> 00:34:46,671
I actually don't know the details of
what was vibrating or making noises.

640
00:34:47,090 --> 00:34:48,360
Was it like an FPGA or something?

641
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:50,520
Hello?
I don't know the details.

642
00:34:50,521 --> 00:34:52,970
My wife is the instrument engineer
for the Sam Instrument Insurance,

643
00:34:53,010 --> 00:34:55,190
so she could probably tell us about
that. And again, exhausting, right

644
00:34:55,220 --> 00:35:00,140
detail. Um, so, so anyway, but this story
does surface once a year. Yeah. Right. Uh,

645
00:35:00,290 --> 00:35:04,280
but I am here to tell you it does not
sing happy birthday to itself every year.

646
00:35:04,490 --> 00:35:09,110
That once on Mars. It was a cute little
stunt and, and that's, uh, that's it.

647
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:13,180
Okay. So, um, we've been talking for
about 40 minutes. Um, what's, uh,

648
00:35:13,181 --> 00:35:16,720
what's throwing out for
audience questions as well? Um,

649
00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:19,450
and kind of while we're getting,
oh, have you seen our microphone?

650
00:35:19,451 --> 00:35:20,320
This is really cool.

651
00:35:20,530 --> 00:35:24,340
The microphone's a little box and a
soft box and they can just throw the box

652
00:35:24,341 --> 00:35:28,360
around the room. Um, but, uh, while
we're, while we're waiting for that,

653
00:35:28,361 --> 00:35:29,190
let me ask you,
you,

654
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:31,360
you were saying the Sam Instrument
is the most complicated instrument.

655
00:35:31,361 --> 00:35:32,980
Was it also the hardest to explain?

656
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:35,730
It was absolutely by far
the hardest to explain.

657
00:35:35,731 --> 00:35:38,380
You'll find about 50 pages of
book on the Sam Instrument night.

658
00:35:38,790 --> 00:35:43,410
I wore Paul Mahaffey out asking
questions about, because you know,

659
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:48,210
when I first started writing this, I
envisioned um, you know, you, you, you,

660
00:35:48,270 --> 00:35:49,740
uh,
have you heat stuff up,

661
00:35:49,741 --> 00:35:53,600
you get a gas and it goes through
the machine comes out and,

662
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:56,850
but that's not how it works at all. You
heat, you heat it up, you get a gas,

663
00:35:56,851 --> 00:35:59,640
it goes into one place, then you open
a valve and it goes into this place.

664
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:02,550
Then you might be turning on something
that pumps slightly but not too much and

665
00:36:02,551 --> 00:36:06,870
you get like a gradient going.
It's so incredibly complicated that the,

666
00:36:07,050 --> 00:36:10,530
the main comment that I get from people
on the mission who are not on the Sam

667
00:36:10,531 --> 00:36:14,130
team is thank God somebody's
finally explained this to
me because I have no idea

668
00:36:14,131 --> 00:36:16,460
how
cool.

669
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:21,570
Uh, so I was wondering how does the delay
between earth and Mars like affect the

670
00:36:21,571 --> 00:36:23,160
teams that operate the rover?
Like,

671
00:36:23,161 --> 00:36:25,770
is it a lot easier to do work when
earth and Mars are close together?

672
00:36:26,310 --> 00:36:28,440
Ah, so no, actually
that's a good question.

673
00:36:28,441 --> 00:36:32,520
So Mars and earth have a wildly differing,
a distance to each other,

674
00:36:32,521 --> 00:36:35,040
which affects the,
the communications lag.

675
00:36:35,070 --> 00:36:39,690
But the fact of the matter is that
because the lag is many minutes,

676
00:36:39,691 --> 00:36:43,830
regardless of the relative distances,
there's no real time commanding.

677
00:36:43,831 --> 00:36:47,910
So you are always doing, um, a
full Saul worth of sequencing.

678
00:36:47,911 --> 00:36:52,350
At a minimum you send the rover receives
its commands at 10:00 AM every morning,

679
00:36:52,670 --> 00:36:54,720
a Mars time. And so, uh,

680
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:58,480
the reason that they do that is
because earth is always up in Mars,

681
00:36:58,481 --> 00:37:03,390
has sky at 10:00 AM local time.
Earth is closer to the sun than Mars is.

682
00:37:03,391 --> 00:37:06,510
So it's always somewhere
relatively close to the sun.

683
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:09,670
And so if you're doing your
commanding at 10:00 AM, um,

684
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:11,130
earth will always be up in the sky,

685
00:37:11,131 --> 00:37:13,260
although sometimes it can be
a little low on the horizon.

686
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:17,970
And so the rover executes,
it's a one Saul's worth of commands.

687
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:22,890
And then in the afternoon, um, there
are overflights by to Mars orbiters,

688
00:37:22,891 --> 00:37:25,050
Mars Odyssey and Mars
reconnaissance orbiter.

689
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:30,240
And it sends its data through a UHF,
a connection up to the orbiter,

690
00:37:30,241 --> 00:37:33,360
which receives the data and
then relays it onto earth.

691
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:37,660
And so there's also overnight
passes by the orbiters. And so, um,

692
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:41,970
you wind up having to command in
these at minimum one Saul increments.

693
00:37:42,210 --> 00:37:47,210
And so it really doesn't matter how
close Mars is except that it is,

694
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:48,350
um,
uh,

695
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:52,350
you can get much higher bandwidth and
your transmission's between Mars and earth

696
00:37:52,370 --> 00:37:56,480
and Mars is closer. So you do get
more data return from the orbiter, uh,

697
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:58,140
because it can communicate faster.

698
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:00,660
You can use a higher data
rate when they're close.

699
00:38:00,661 --> 00:38:04,680
And so you'll see these like seasonal
spikes and data rate that are not actually

700
00:38:04,681 --> 00:38:05,460
seasonal.

701
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:08,610
They happen when Maurice
has near opposition when
earth and Mars are close to

702
00:38:08,611 --> 00:38:11,020
each other. And then on
the opposite side, when,

703
00:38:11,021 --> 00:38:12,840
when Mars gets into
conjunction with a song,

704
00:38:12,850 --> 00:38:15,700
you actually have three weeks where
you're not allowed to talk to the rover at

705
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:15,841
all.

706
00:38:15,841 --> 00:38:18,750
Cause if there were a problem you couldn't
be sure that your message would get

707
00:38:18,751 --> 00:38:21,810
through on garbled to be
able to save the rover.

708
00:38:21,811 --> 00:38:25,530
So they all the spacecraft kind of hunker
down and go into a fairly low activity

709
00:38:25,531 --> 00:38:29,280
mode during conjunction.
I have a question.

710
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:35,470
Are there pieces of the rover
that it can separate from itself?

711
00:38:35,471 --> 00:38:37,720
Like in this selfie picture?
Um,

712
00:38:37,750 --> 00:38:42,250
I don't see how there's something attached
to it that would take the selfie. So,

713
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:43,330
um,
this,

714
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:46,930
the question of who took the picture and
how the Selfie works is one that pops

715
00:38:46,931 --> 00:38:51,840
up every single time I post a selfie.
The issue is that the, although the,

716
00:38:51,841 --> 00:38:54,510
the field of view of the
Molly camera is fairly wide,

717
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:57,700
it's not anywhere near as wide as the kind
of camera you have in your cell phone.

718
00:38:57,820 --> 00:39:01,090
It's actually very narrow.
So in order to take a Selfie,

719
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:06,630
the rover actually takes about 70 pictures
of itself in kind of a matrix sort of

720
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:11,840
way. And it repositions the arm to
keep the arm out of view. You know,

721
00:39:11,860 --> 00:39:15,070
it would never be able to photograph.
It's whole arm regardless.

722
00:39:15,430 --> 00:39:19,630
And so you wind up mosaic
King and image together, um,

723
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:24,060
like this out of, out of multiple
different images and they just, uh,

724
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:25,500
they do it in a way so that the,

725
00:39:25,610 --> 00:39:29,020
the arm is not constantly poking into
view from all these different directions

726
00:39:29,021 --> 00:39:33,670
because when, um, when you do
take the Selfie, you do see,

727
00:39:33,730 --> 00:39:34,970
uh,
you know,

728
00:39:35,010 --> 00:39:39,670
you will see the arm in multiple images
and so you have to come up with a way of

729
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:41,230
uh,
neatly cutting it off.

730
00:39:41,231 --> 00:39:44,260
You actually see more of the arm in
this picture than you see in most of the

731
00:39:44,261 --> 00:39:47,360
self portraits. Usually they
chop it off at the shoulder, um,

732
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:51,790
because otherwise it would be
crossing the front of the, um, rover.

733
00:39:51,791 --> 00:39:53,200
But because of all
those multiple pictures,

734
00:39:53,201 --> 00:39:55,390
you wind up being able
to get the arm out of it.

735
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:57,520
And there's no real sensible way.

736
00:39:57,730 --> 00:40:02,020
One of the more disconcerting images that
I've seen was a self portrait taken by

737
00:40:02,021 --> 00:40:02,854
the math camp,

738
00:40:03,250 --> 00:40:06,640
which is the only way that opportunity
and spirit can take self portraits.

739
00:40:06,641 --> 00:40:08,600
As you take a, you can get a, um,

740
00:40:08,670 --> 00:40:13,670
a mosaic of the deck of the
rover by shooting multiple
images with the mass cam.

741
00:40:14,170 --> 00:40:14,981
And in those images,

742
00:40:14,981 --> 00:40:18,820
of course the master is missing because
it can't photograph the mass camp.

743
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:21,760
It can't photograph it's own master.
And so you wind up,

744
00:40:21,761 --> 00:40:22,990
you get a great view of the arm,

745
00:40:22,991 --> 00:40:25,300
but the rovers headless and
it's really kind of disturbing.

746
00:40:29,410 --> 00:40:33,290
Is this the one that had to
like really difficult landing?

747
00:40:33,291 --> 00:40:36,290
Like it was really complicated and
they were really worried about it.

748
00:40:37,350 --> 00:40:39,800
Well, if she goes into a lot of detail
about that in a book, by the way, it's,

749
00:40:39,801 --> 00:40:43,230
it's really casting. Yeah.
So, um, it's kind of fun.

750
00:40:43,270 --> 00:40:47,340
It wasn't really complicated landing.
It's a Rube Goldberg he and landing.

751
00:40:47,341 --> 00:40:48,520
So it has,
um,

752
00:40:48,810 --> 00:40:53,130
the problem with landing on Mars is that
it has enough atmosphere to burn you up,

753
00:40:53,131 --> 00:40:57,600
but not enough atmosphere to slow you
down. So it's easier to land on the moon.

754
00:40:57,630 --> 00:41:01,380
It's easier to land on earth,
um, on the moon. No atmosphere.

755
00:41:01,381 --> 00:41:04,150
You just streak in blast with retro
rockets. Boom. You're on the surface.

756
00:41:04,151 --> 00:41:08,040
And the problem on earth parachute and
heat shield slows you down enough where

757
00:41:08,041 --> 00:41:11,190
you just kind of coast into a landing.
That's what the space shuttle's did.

758
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:13,920
That's what all the Apollo
capsules did on Mars.

759
00:41:13,921 --> 00:41:15,450
You have to combine all of those things.

760
00:41:15,630 --> 00:41:20,220
So you have a heat shield that takes you
from interplanetary travel speeds down

761
00:41:20,221 --> 00:41:21,420
to supersonic speeds.

762
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:25,620
Then you have a parachute that takes
you from supersonic to subsonic. Um,

763
00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:28,380
then you have rockets that
slow you down from subs,

764
00:41:28,410 --> 00:41:32,730
from subsonic to still.
And then you have to touch down.

765
00:41:32,731 --> 00:41:36,950
And missions have accomplished this
in different ways. Most Mars missions,

766
00:41:36,951 --> 00:41:41,380
our landers and so what the landers
typically do is they get down to it as

767
00:41:41,390 --> 00:41:43,520
opposed to rovers. Yeah, sorry. Um,

768
00:41:43,550 --> 00:41:48,550
so they get pretty close to the surface
and then usually they cut off their

769
00:41:48,651 --> 00:41:53,210
rockets right above the surface because
you don't want to be blasting the

770
00:41:53,211 --> 00:41:56,000
surface with a lot of a rocket exhaust.

771
00:41:56,300 --> 00:42:00,770
And so they'll have like crushable legs.
That's what Phoenix and insight have.

772
00:42:00,771 --> 00:42:04,490
They have legs that can take up that last
bit of drop or you'll have what spirit

773
00:42:04,491 --> 00:42:05,271
and opportunity had,

774
00:42:05,271 --> 00:42:08,450
which are the airbags surrounding
and it actually bounced to a halt,

775
00:42:08,451 --> 00:42:09,620
which I think is nutty.

776
00:42:09,950 --> 00:42:14,310
I mean take a ridiculously expensive
machine and whack it on the surface and

777
00:42:14,311 --> 00:42:19,260
multiple times. That's what spirit and
opportunity in pathline. And so, um,

778
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:21,210
curiosities approach,
um,

779
00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:24,950
curiosity was already too big to
have any extra lander hardware.

780
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:29,810
And so it said it had a rocket assisted
backpack that it lowered the rover on a

781
00:42:29,811 --> 00:42:33,720
rope and the rope and then gently let the,
the,

782
00:42:33,730 --> 00:42:36,860
the rover touch the surface
and there slack on the cables.

783
00:42:37,070 --> 00:42:40,430
And once the machine detected
that there slack on the cables,

784
00:42:40,550 --> 00:42:44,580
it cuts the cables and flies a jet pack
away, which like you can just imagine it.

785
00:42:44,630 --> 00:42:48,910
It's just like any Wiley,
Katie, Katie character clunk.

786
00:42:48,950 --> 00:42:51,080
And then there's like a big
explosion and a boom and stuff.

787
00:42:51,081 --> 00:42:53,530
We got a picture of which we actually
got a picture of. It was amazing.

788
00:42:53,570 --> 00:42:57,140
The first curiosity image from the surface
of Mars was taken by its rear has cam

789
00:42:57,141 --> 00:43:00,440
and you see this plume of dust on the
horizon and they later figured out that

790
00:43:00,441 --> 00:43:01,650
that was probably the,

791
00:43:01,651 --> 00:43:05,600
the plume from the explosion of the jet
pack when it crashed on the surface,

792
00:43:05,601 --> 00:43:08,360
which I think is just
great. So yeah, so it was,

793
00:43:08,390 --> 00:43:11,900
it's an incredibly complicated landing.
But as I explained to the book,

794
00:43:11,901 --> 00:43:15,580
it's actually not really out of family
from what had been done before. Um,

795
00:43:16,250 --> 00:43:19,690
hanging the rover on a rope was actually
exactly what they did with spirit and

796
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:22,280
opportunity.
That airbag thingy was descent,

797
00:43:22,310 --> 00:43:26,960
was hanging on a rope off of
the retro rockets. And so,

798
00:43:27,020 --> 00:43:30,710
um,
the landing looked ridiculous,

799
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:34,760
but it was very well modeled.
And after they had the, uh,

800
00:43:34,790 --> 00:43:39,140
the two year launch delay, I have never
seen engineers as confident as I saw.

801
00:43:39,141 --> 00:43:42,020
I mean, engineers as a rule are not
confident people, they're like, well,

802
00:43:42,021 --> 00:43:43,990
it might work if all the conditions
are right, love with him. You know,

803
00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:47,810
they don't want to tell you
it's absolutely going to
work because like as they

804
00:43:47,811 --> 00:43:51,770
say in the rocket business, there's a
thousand ways for a lunch to go wrong.

805
00:43:51,770 --> 00:43:55,220
Only one way for it to
go right. And so, um,

806
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:58,160
but when they were,
uh,

807
00:43:58,190 --> 00:44:02,550
they had the last two years to really
prepare and throw all kinds of um,

808
00:44:02,780 --> 00:44:05,240
situations at it, you
know, dust storms and,

809
00:44:05,540 --> 00:44:10,190
and bad navigation and failure,
one of the rockets and all kinds of stuff.

810
00:44:10,220 --> 00:44:14,070
And the machine in their simulations
perform with flying colors. And in the,

811
00:44:14,310 --> 00:44:17,840
in the final event, it was just straight
down the middle. Everything was nominal,

812
00:44:17,841 --> 00:44:19,480
nominal, nominal. Um,

813
00:44:19,580 --> 00:44:22,310
except for one little detail that maybe
I'll let you guys read the book for.

814
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:24,553
Yeah.

815
00:44:24,770 --> 00:44:28,400
So software people about while the Mike
is going to the next person and software

816
00:44:28,401 --> 00:44:31,800
people like us, I understand
the concept of, uh, Easter eggs

817
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:34,860
and little hidden things in, you
know, maybe your web browser,

818
00:44:34,861 --> 00:44:37,740
you hit control alt shift ass and it
pops up a flight simulator or something

819
00:44:37,741 --> 00:44:42,030
like that. Right. Um, and curiosity has
one of those, uh, Easter eggs as well.

820
00:44:42,031 --> 00:44:46,110
And in the wheels before they, before
they had not on purpose holes in them,

821
00:44:46,111 --> 00:44:47,340
they had on purpose holes in them.

822
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:51,750
That's right. So if you look at
the, the wheels of the rover,

823
00:44:51,751 --> 00:44:54,540
you can see that there are deliberately
a whole bunch of holes punched in them.

824
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:57,360
Um, this is kind of a callback
to spirit and opportunity,

825
00:44:57,750 --> 00:45:02,250
which they were connected to their lander
with these bolts that were fired and

826
00:45:02,251 --> 00:45:05,790
separated after landing. And so there
are holes on spirit and opportunities.

827
00:45:05,791 --> 00:45:09,790
We all set are there just as an
artifact of the method by which they are

828
00:45:09,791 --> 00:45:10,740
attached to the lander,

829
00:45:10,980 --> 00:45:14,370
but they turned out to be really useful
for the science team because you can see

830
00:45:14,371 --> 00:45:17,820
the little mark that the holes left in
the wheel tracks to actually measure

831
00:45:17,821 --> 00:45:19,310
distances.
Um,

832
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:23,010
you can also use it to see how much the
rover we will slipped during driving.

833
00:45:23,011 --> 00:45:25,830
So you can kind of measure distances in
one way and then in a different way and

834
00:45:25,831 --> 00:45:27,540
see how long or short it was.

835
00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:30,480
And the rover actually got to
where it was using this for.

836
00:45:30,481 --> 00:45:33,930
Odometry could actually use its own wheel
tracks to help understand how far to

837
00:45:33,931 --> 00:45:34,764
travel.

838
00:45:34,770 --> 00:45:39,360
So they wanted to include some kind
of odometry marking on the wheels on

839
00:45:39,361 --> 00:45:44,160
curiosity to make sure that it would be
easy to tell how many wheel turns there

840
00:45:44,161 --> 00:45:45,450
had been in the rover tracks.

841
00:45:45,810 --> 00:45:49,060
And so the first thing they did was that
they actually machines the letters JPL

842
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:52,710
into the wheels, into the treads. And
so there's a picture in my book of the,

843
00:45:52,711 --> 00:45:57,210
of the, an early set of wheels that has
JPL on it. So I left tracks JPL, JPL,

844
00:45:57,211 --> 00:46:00,180
JPL as it was going. And that's what I
was like, you guys, you can't do that.

845
00:46:00,181 --> 00:46:02,790
So they came up with another plan,

846
00:46:02,791 --> 00:46:05,670
which was to put the letters
JPL in the wheels in Morse code.

847
00:46:06,270 --> 00:46:09,500
So that's what you see.
There's three rows there and they are,

848
00:46:09,510 --> 00:46:13,380
have like narrower and wider gaps.
And that's the letters JPL in Morse code.

849
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:15,500
Um,

850
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:19,220
so this isn't actually a
curiosity question because
there's something else you

851
00:46:19,221 --> 00:46:20,660
mentioned earlier that's been bugging me.

852
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:24,870
You said the Russians landed
a mostly mechanical, uh,

853
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:28,910
lander on Venus and electronics wouldn't
stand up to the surface temperatures.

854
00:46:28,970 --> 00:46:33,710
How did they communicate the
information off the planet to us?

855
00:46:34,350 --> 00:46:37,990
Well, um, I don't actually
know enough about the, um,

856
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:41,790
about how those missions worked. I mean,
they did have like a pressure vessel,

857
00:46:41,791 --> 00:46:46,740
a temperature, um, a safe vessel on
the inside that had the electronic,

858
00:46:46,741 --> 00:46:50,850
the limited electronics that there were,
and they did do radio communications,

859
00:46:51,060 --> 00:46:53,760
director Earth. They didn't have orbiter,
so they were doing it direct to earth.

860
00:46:53,761 --> 00:46:55,590
But then Venus is actually
relatively close to Earth,

861
00:46:55,591 --> 00:46:59,280
so you don't have to have very powerful
radio to get that data back. Um,

862
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:01,650
I'm afraid I'm not an
electronics person myself,

863
00:47:01,651 --> 00:47:03,570
so I don't really know the
answer to that question.

864
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:09,840
Um, I, I, we're, we're kind
of, we're starting to run,
I'll run a little low on time.

865
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:12,000
Um, uh, and it kills me
that we're not going to get,

866
00:47:12,260 --> 00:47:13,750
get to all the questions when I ask you.

867
00:47:13,751 --> 00:47:16,140
Maybe we should take one more audience
question and I'll ask you kind of a wrap

868
00:47:16,141 --> 00:47:17,230
up here.
Okay.

869
00:47:17,910 --> 00:47:21,300
So my question is, uh, what happens
if something mechanical fails?

870
00:47:21,330 --> 00:47:25,830
Is there any self repair kind
of capability? There is not,

871
00:47:25,860 --> 00:47:29,340
but there's a lot of redundancy,
a lot of redundant capability.

872
00:47:29,770 --> 00:47:34,480
So there's a lot of planning done to
figure out how the rover can still

873
00:47:34,481 --> 00:47:39,430
accomplish its mission even if this,
that, or another component fails. Um,

874
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:42,250
so like the computer
systems are fully redundant.

875
00:47:42,251 --> 00:47:45,430
There's an a side and a B side and
various components or cross strap to each

876
00:47:45,431 --> 00:47:49,360
other. So when a computer
fails as actually happened
200 days into the mission,

877
00:47:49,570 --> 00:47:53,350
they can swap to the backup and operate
on the backup while they repair the

878
00:47:53,351 --> 00:47:57,340
prime computer. And so they've done that
with, um, with the main computer already.

879
00:47:57,490 --> 00:48:00,130
It actually took them a long time
to bring the backup back online,

880
00:48:00,131 --> 00:48:01,930
which was kind of scary.
Um,

881
00:48:01,980 --> 00:48:06,120
there had been mechanical problems like
problems with the wheels. And so, um,

882
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:10,600
you get through that through robustness,
basically any one of the wheels,

883
00:48:10,601 --> 00:48:14,950
the motors are powerful enough to,
uh, to raise the entire rovers.

884
00:48:14,951 --> 00:48:16,000
Wait vertically.

885
00:48:16,001 --> 00:48:18,790
So like if you attached a rope to it
and you could wind a rope on one of the

886
00:48:18,791 --> 00:48:19,750
wheels and it would,

887
00:48:20,020 --> 00:48:23,560
and the motor is strong enough to
be able to lift the whole rover. Um,

888
00:48:24,070 --> 00:48:27,760
this actually became important for spirit
opportunity because both of them have,

889
00:48:27,790 --> 00:48:29,500
have had different
kinds of wheel failures.

890
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:33,470
And so spirit in particular was dragging
one of its wheels for a long time. Um,

891
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:35,350
but the rover is still
able to drive that way.

892
00:48:35,560 --> 00:48:38,700
It's a good thing because we made some
science discoveries because of that. Yeah.

893
00:48:38,710 --> 00:48:42,190
And so, um, the biggest
problem that curiosity has
been dealing with lately is a,

894
00:48:42,191 --> 00:48:44,200
is a major mechanical
failure and the drill,

895
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:48,280
so the drill used to operate with a
pair of prongs that it pressed against a

896
00:48:48,281 --> 00:48:52,240
rock and then there's a feed mechanism
that pushed the drill into the rock while

897
00:48:52,241 --> 00:48:53,860
the everything else stayed still.

898
00:48:54,070 --> 00:48:58,480
And the feed mechanism failed almost
completely. They, it was very sticky.

899
00:48:58,810 --> 00:49:01,000
They couldn't get it to
move backward and forward,

900
00:49:01,001 --> 00:49:05,080
which is critical for drilling. And so
over the period of more than a year now,

901
00:49:05,470 --> 00:49:08,980
they've managed to get the bulky
feed to extend all the way.

902
00:49:08,981 --> 00:49:13,210
So now the fetus permanently extended
and they just a couple of weeks ago for

903
00:49:13,211 --> 00:49:14,170
the first time,

904
00:49:14,470 --> 00:49:18,080
managed to do what they call feed extended
drilling where instead of using the,

905
00:49:18,081 --> 00:49:22,480
the feed mechanism, which no longer
works there now using arm most motors.

906
00:49:22,570 --> 00:49:25,870
So it's like taking a drill and trying
to drill into a wall like this. You know,

907
00:49:25,871 --> 00:49:29,230
you can imagine it's hard but,
but the curiosity is arm is pretty strong.

908
00:49:29,231 --> 00:49:32,230
And so they just kind of lean on the arm
and they pushed the drill into the rock

909
00:49:32,260 --> 00:49:36,850
and it worked. So, um, it's taken
them a long time to fix it. But, uh,

910
00:49:37,180 --> 00:49:41,500
these engineers are really ingenious
at solving problems. And so,

911
00:49:41,890 --> 00:49:46,270
um, a lot of what you do on an extended
mission and extended extended mission,

912
00:49:46,271 --> 00:49:47,740
which is what curiosity is on now,

913
00:49:47,950 --> 00:49:52,000
is figuring out how to make the most of
an aging machine that does have problems

914
00:49:52,001 --> 00:49:55,310
but can still do great science
where it is. And so, um,

915
00:49:55,780 --> 00:49:59,270
all of these people have a lot
of experience in making, um,

916
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:02,950
old groany machines work. I mean, I'd
like to write a book about Galileo,

917
00:50:02,951 --> 00:50:06,520
about all the things they had to do to
keep that thing going after radiation

918
00:50:06,521 --> 00:50:08,350
fried at Jupiter multiple times.

919
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:13,450
And so curiosity is still got a lot of
life in it. Um, they'll have problems. Um,

920
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:17,410
but you know, they wished
the problems weren't there,
but they, they're like, okay,

921
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:22,210
here's, this is our new reality and we'll
keep going. That's how it works. So, uh,

922
00:50:22,230 --> 00:50:22,540
it's,

923
00:50:22,540 --> 00:50:25,600
it's killing me that I've got like 20
more questions here and we've got like

924
00:50:25,601 --> 00:50:28,310
three minutes. So that's not
enough time. I'm thinking. Um,

925
00:50:28,340 --> 00:50:33,020
but, uh, but uh, maybe we can end on
this note, uh, by asking you like,

926
00:50:33,290 --> 00:50:37,310
um, what do you hope that readers
will take away from this gorgeous,

927
00:50:37,311 --> 00:50:39,210
terrific book that I could
not more highly recommend?

928
00:50:40,510 --> 00:50:42,950
Oh Gosh. I hope that they will. Um,

929
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:47,830
I guess I hope that people will take away
the fact that they can understand this

930
00:50:47,831 --> 00:50:50,500
is a very complicated machine,
but what it's doing,

931
00:50:50,501 --> 00:50:55,210
why it's there and how it works or not,
or not inaccessible to everyone.

932
00:50:55,390 --> 00:50:59,530
And that's one of the great things about
space exploration I think is that it's

933
00:50:59,531 --> 00:51:01,510
easy to explain why we're doing it.

934
00:51:01,511 --> 00:51:06,220
The fundamental questions we're trying
to answer. Was there ever a life on Mars?

935
00:51:06,221 --> 00:51:09,460
Are we alone in the universe?
That kind of stuff. Um, and it's,

936
00:51:09,580 --> 00:51:13,210
and it's fairly easy to understand how
we're going about solving those problems.

937
00:51:13,211 --> 00:51:16,420
Were sending a robot with a drill that's
like sampling rocks and we put them

938
00:51:16,421 --> 00:51:19,450
into a lab and, and all of these things.
And you can communicate with children.

939
00:51:19,451 --> 00:51:23,230
You can communicate with
science interested in adults
as well. Um, and it's,

940
00:51:23,231 --> 00:51:25,630
it's just very accessible and,
um,

941
00:51:25,631 --> 00:51:28,870
everybody can kind of participate in the
adventure by following along with what

942
00:51:28,871 --> 00:51:29,521
they're doing.
They,

943
00:51:29,521 --> 00:51:33,790
they share their raw images straight from
ours directly on the Internet so that

944
00:51:33,791 --> 00:51:38,020
you can see every day, you can tune in at
JPL and see what they've been doing. Um,

945
00:51:38,021 --> 00:51:42,460
I highly recommend
midnight planets.com as a,

946
00:51:42,820 --> 00:51:43,653
it's a,
um,

947
00:51:43,660 --> 00:51:48,190
an enthusiast built website
that aggregates all of the
images from the different

948
00:51:48,191 --> 00:51:52,270
rovers and puts them up in ways that are
easy to see. And it's, uh, it's just,

949
00:51:52,271 --> 00:51:55,220
it's a fun adventure and we're
all part of it, basically. Yeah.

950
00:51:55,510 --> 00:51:59,280
Emily, I'm so sad that we're at
a time. Um, uh, uh, but I, I,

951
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:01,090
I enthusiastically recommend this book.

952
00:52:01,091 --> 00:52:03,130
The book is the design and
engineering of curiosity,

953
00:52:03,131 --> 00:52:05,350
how the Mars rover performs its job.

954
00:52:05,620 --> 00:52:08,800
All the stuff you've heard us talk about
today at a whole lot more stuff is in

955
00:52:08,801 --> 00:52:10,750
there. It's really terrific.
I highly recommend it. Yeah.

956
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:15,230
It's also on my blog at planetary.org/blog
you'll find I write updates about

957
00:52:15,231 --> 00:52:17,180
every two or three months
on what curiosity is doing.

958
00:52:17,181 --> 00:52:19,010
I'll probably have a new one
out in a couple of weeks,

959
00:52:19,220 --> 00:52:21,430
right on. Um, I wish we
had another hour to talk,

960
00:52:21,431 --> 00:52:23,530
but maybe you'll be able to come
back and we'll be able to do it then.

961
00:52:24,300 --> 00:52:27,760
In the meantime, please join
me in thanking our guest
today. Emily Lakdawalla.
