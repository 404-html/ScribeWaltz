1
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:05,210
Thank you for coming to our
most recent NASA Google talk.

2
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:09,600
Today we have a Piramal PK
as he's known casually, um,

3
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:10,970
to talk about drones.

4
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:16,250
Hormel is the manager of the
safe operations autonomous
systems unit at ames.

5
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:24,490
He's been there for about 13 years and
he holds degrees in both industrial and

6
00:00:24,981 --> 00:00:28,700
production engineering. Is that correct?
Okay, great. Without further ado,

7
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:31,220
I'd like to give it the stage over to PK.

8
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:32,233
Thank you.

9
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:33,583
Thank you.

10
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:40,500
Thank you for inviting me. This is
a great privilege to be here. Uh,

11
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:45,160
I had a wonderful Google
lunch that everybody talks
about, so that was nice. Um,

12
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:50,960
today I'm going to talk to you about how
we can enable safely enable large scale

13
00:00:51,001 --> 00:00:54,930
uas operations in the loyalty
to their space. As you know,

14
00:00:54,931 --> 00:00:59,931
there is a lot of excitement going on
in the drone industry and I know Google

15
00:01:00,091 --> 00:01:05,091
and many other companies are working on
basically drones and drone applications.

16
00:01:05,641 --> 00:01:09,780
And our goal is to try to enable the
entire industry in a safe manner.

17
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:15,960
So let's, before we start to
look at the future of aviation,

18
00:01:15,961 --> 00:01:20,961
let's look at the current evaluation
system and how the aircraft operate in the

19
00:01:22,741 --> 00:01:25,710
national airspace system.
What we referred to as Nass.

20
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:36,690
This animation displays air
traffic over the United States.

21
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:41,550
It was created using real air traffic
data from the Federal Aviation

22
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:42,383
Administration.

23
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:47,160
The animation starts at 8:00 PM and ends
at 8:00 PM eastern time the following

24
00:01:47,161 --> 00:01:49,920
day late in the evening.
Uh,

25
00:01:49,921 --> 00:01:53,610
Russia flights can be seen
departing for European destinations.

26
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:58,140
Quite a few aircraft are still seen
flying between the west coast airports.

27
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:02,850
In the middle of the night the skies are
clear and the number of aircraft drops

28
00:02:02,851 --> 00:02:04,020
below 900.

29
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:07,860
Notice the red eye transcontinental
flights headed to the east coast.

30
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:13,140
Around 5:00 AM flights are seeing
departing from Memphis, a hub for FedEx.

31
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:18,710
As the day dawns traffic starts to build
up on the east coast at 8:00 AM half of

32
00:02:19,861 --> 00:02:23,520
the country is bubbling with traffic
while the other half is still sleeping,

33
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:28,230
flights are seeing moving westward in
the airspace gets populated with aircraft

34
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:29,310
across the country.

35
00:02:29,311 --> 00:02:34,311
As the day progresses around 11:00 AM a
steady stream of arrivals is seen coming

36
00:02:34,711 --> 00:02:36,090
across the Atlantic Ocean.

37
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:39,630
The various airline hubs can
be seen throughout the day.

38
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:43,710
A hub can be identified by the
density of aircraft around it.

39
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:47,160
The two holes scene in the
triangle between San Francisco,

40
00:02:47,161 --> 00:02:49,230
Los Angeles and Salt Lake City.

41
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:54,030
Our military operation areas and civilian
aircraft are forbidden to fly through

42
00:02:54,031 --> 00:02:56,250
them in the middle of the day.

43
00:02:56,490 --> 00:03:01,490
The number of aircraft peak just over
5,000 the animation shows the congested

44
00:03:02,441 --> 00:03:06,790
northeastern part of the United States
and the complexity of the air traffic

45
00:03:06,791 --> 00:03:07,900
management problem.

46
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:20,400
This animation displays air traffic and
weather over the northeastern part of

47
00:03:20,401 --> 00:03:21,450
the United States.

48
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:26,220
In the beginning the flow is smooth but
when severe weather strikes around 9:30

49
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:28,410
AM the airports can't handle the arrivals.

50
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:32,730
Many aircraft are seen holding in the
air shown by the race track patterns of

51
00:03:32,731 --> 00:03:37,080
blue lines which represent trails of
aircraft arriving at four New York area

52
00:03:37,081 --> 00:03:37,914
airports.

53
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:42,450
Several aircraft are seen deviating
around severe weather and flying through

54
00:03:42,451 --> 00:03:44,370
gaps between storm systems.

55
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:47,880
Many aircraft usually
flying along the east coast.

56
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:51,360
We're directed to fly over the Atlantic
Ocean to reach their New York area

57
00:03:51,361 --> 00:03:54,900
destinations on this day
of significant delays,

58
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:58,380
weather impacted arrival traffic
for more than seven hours,

59
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:03,240
whether is the main cause of all delays
of air traffic in the United States.

60
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:08,080
So let's talk about the two animation.

61
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:12,430
The first animation actually shows the
complexity in the national airspace

62
00:04:12,431 --> 00:04:16,660
system as it exists today.
There are 50,000 operations in a day,

63
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:20,060
about 5,000 at the peak time.
Um,

64
00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:24,220
if you postulate the future
with drones operating that,

65
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:28,540
those numbers that you just saw,
we'll compare really,

66
00:04:28,541 --> 00:04:32,860
really small with as compared with what
we are expecting to happen in the future.

67
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:36,190
So we really need some way
to organize this traffic.

68
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:41,230
The second animation that assured us
that the complexity increases as soon as

69
00:04:41,231 --> 00:04:45,550
the weather actually happens to come
in the national airspace system.

70
00:04:45,551 --> 00:04:47,530
So as soon as you experienced the weather,

71
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:51,970
we have tremendous delays and lots
of impact in the airspace system.

72
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:57,480
Now if we start to look at the future for
those who have gone to India and other

73
00:04:57,551 --> 00:05:02,551
places or have seen these pictures from
the past can postulate and relate to

74
00:05:02,681 --> 00:05:07,450
this, that when you start to have
number of new entrants on the road,

75
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:12,460
all of a sudden you realize that you need
some way to organize them because the

76
00:05:12,461 --> 00:05:16,990
complexity is gone up and you have
different interests and different types of

77
00:05:16,991 --> 00:05:20,860
operations happening and the and without
some kind of organization you are going

78
00:05:20,861 --> 00:05:23,740
to have a trade off between
efficiency and safety.

79
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:26,530
So all of sudden you realize that let's,

80
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:30,670
let's make sure that we have some
way to organize this traffic.

81
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:36,100
What happened in 1956 is two aircraft
collided or Grand Canyon and that started

82
00:05:36,101 --> 00:05:39,430
the air transportation system
and a traffic management system.

83
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:44,770
1958 when [inaudible] was born
at the same time NASA was born.

84
00:05:44,771 --> 00:05:49,771
So what we are trying to do is get ahead
of that and come up with a system that

85
00:05:50,441 --> 00:05:54,700
will allow us to enable safely enable
large scale drone operations or the low

86
00:05:54,701 --> 00:05:57,620
altitude currently the
loyalty to their space.

87
00:05:57,621 --> 00:06:02,150
Typically College Class G space
is unregulated but not control.

88
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:07,070
So as soon as you start to pump in lots
of drones and other vehicles there,

89
00:06:07,071 --> 00:06:11,960
we would like to see that they basically
operate harmoniously with each other,

90
00:06:11,961 --> 00:06:15,500
helicopters, personnel, calf
cause as well as drones.

91
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,113
How do we do that?

92
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:21,680
So our near term goal is to basically
safely enable these operation as soon as

93
00:06:21,681 --> 00:06:22,514
possible.

94
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:27,620
And the longterm goal is to accommodate
the complexity and increased basically

95
00:06:27,621 --> 00:06:31,490
capacity that is expected
to happen in that airspace.

96
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:35,540
There are lots of applications of drones
that have been postulated of course

97
00:06:35,541 --> 00:06:39,200
surveillance of key assets
like railroad and pipelines,

98
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:43,550
search and rescue, cargo
delivery, Uav helping,

99
00:06:43,551 --> 00:06:47,300
ambulance taking pictures,
recreational activities and such.

100
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:51,380
So once you realize that there are a
number of these operations going to happen

101
00:06:51,381 --> 00:06:55,730
at the same time, same place in the same
airspace, uh, then we really say that,

102
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:58,160
let's make sure that we have
some way to organize them.

103
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:03,460
So that's basically calling for a
persistent system at an airspace and a

104
00:07:03,501 --> 00:07:08,000
geographical area as well as you look
at the board table system where you go

105
00:07:08,001 --> 00:07:13,001
from one basically area to another
area area such as a disaster relief

106
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:18,641
applications or agriculture applications
where they are very confined due to

107
00:07:19,221 --> 00:07:21,110
that geographical area or airspace.

108
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:24,650
So we are talking about two different
types of applications. Nonetheless,

109
00:07:24,651 --> 00:07:29,270
the characteristics of enabling them
safely and harmoniously or the same

110
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:33,980
in terms of us traffic manager management.

111
00:07:33,981 --> 00:07:36,050
We are really trying
to balance three goals.

112
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:38,930
First goal is national
and regional security.

113
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:43,970
We want to make sure that the drones
by the accidentally don't go where they

114
00:07:43,971 --> 00:07:47,190
shouldn't go. Uh, such as uh, uh,

115
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:49,730
White House and Wall Street and,

116
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:54,880
and number of key assets on the ground
as well as we don't have rogue operators

117
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:57,660
that basically go and
create damage intentional.

118
00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:02,900
So we have to worry about the national
and regional security. At the same time,

119
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:07,550
we are trying to make sure that we get
economic value of using the low altitude

120
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:11,420
using the drone applications. And
there are number of these applications,

121
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,590
commercial applications.
Uh,

122
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:17,210
as you saw agriculture application
as well as personal applications.

123
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:18,380
My personal draw,

124
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:23,120
my personal dream is that every home will
have a drone and every home will serve

125
00:08:23,121 --> 00:08:25,160
as a error or drum sometime in the future.

126
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:29,810
So how do we enable that that needs
to be enabled through safe airspace

127
00:08:29,811 --> 00:08:30,644
integration.

128
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:35,830
So the idea is to create flexible
digital virtual infrastructure.

129
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:41,190
So flexibility where possible
and structure where it's
necessary is one month

130
00:08:41,191 --> 00:08:41,840
mantra.

131
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:46,840
And second is you match the geographical
needs applications with the performance

132
00:08:47,961 --> 00:08:51,710
that's required to operate in that
airspace. So let's take each one of them.

133
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:53,330
So flexibility where possible.

134
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:58,230
So the idea is that you can go wherever
you want to go till the point where the

135
00:08:58,231 --> 00:09:00,270
demand and capacity are off balance.

136
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:05,480
Then you may need some structures such
as corridors crossing restrictions or

137
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:10,140
altitude for direction. So it's completely
based on the demand and the capacity.

138
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:15,420
The second month, right here is the need
of the geography as well as application.

139
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:20,690
So here the context is that if you are
operating in the remote areas and your

140
00:09:20,851 --> 00:09:22,980
application is you're doing surveillance,

141
00:09:22,981 --> 00:09:24,690
you're never going to
get down to the ground.

142
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:29,640
Then the required performance on the
airspace operations on the vehicle as well

143
00:09:29,641 --> 00:09:34,530
as airspace is different than you're
going to operate in the congested airspace

144
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:39,150
as well as near urban airspace and going
all the way to the down all the way to

145
00:09:39,151 --> 00:09:42,150
the ground to the last and first 50 feet.

146
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:46,080
So the performance characteristics on the
vehicle and the type of capability you

147
00:09:46,081 --> 00:09:50,100
need on the vehicle is different.
So we want to match the geography,

148
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:54,510
the risks involved with that as well
as the application with the required

149
00:09:54,511 --> 00:09:57,420
performance to operate in that airspace.

150
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:02,670
So what is UTM question always comes,
what is UTM?

151
00:10:02,671 --> 00:10:07,650
Utm sort of is a research prototype and
ideally what we are after is developing

152
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:12,390
the airspace operations
performance requirements
through this research prototype,

153
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:16,170
which will allow the operators
to basically submit flight plans,

154
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:19,110
tons of light plants at the same time,

155
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:22,520
and execute their missions
at the loyalty to operations.

156
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:26,220
He will also check to make sure
that there are no constraints,

157
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:30,270
they're not violating any constraints.
And we'll talk about what those look like.

158
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:31,980
At the same time,

159
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:36,900
we envision that these basically system
will consist of multiple airspace

160
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:40,230
providers, just like Internet
service, Reuters, Isp,

161
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:44,130
you could have multiple layers with
service providers that could interoperate

162
00:10:44,131 --> 00:10:46,200
harmoniously in the same airspace.

163
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:49,560
So let's look at the functions of Utm.

164
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:53,280
The first function is airspace
operations in management.

165
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:56,310
So what is the boundary
of the low altitude?

166
00:10:56,430 --> 00:10:59,310
So currently we envision
500 feet and below.

167
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:04,550
Obviously that's dependent on the type
of operations you want to conduct,

168
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:09,420
the types of missions as well as the
density. So you might want to change that.

169
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,530
But nonetheless,

170
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:15,570
at the moment we are envisioning that
400 feet and below there is no reason to

171
00:11:15,571 --> 00:11:19,080
climb, to spend energy if
you don't have to. And again,

172
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:23,280
going back to the point we made before
that geographical needs and applications

173
00:11:23,281 --> 00:11:24,930
will have to be coupled together.

174
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:29,460
So the rules for airspace will be based
on the performance and the geography

175
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:31,500
that's associated with that operation.

176
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:36,510
So this picture shows geo fences.
So there are two types of Geo Francis.

177
00:11:36,511 --> 00:11:41,511
One is a static geo fence
such as basically White House
or in this case it shows

178
00:11:42,271 --> 00:11:45,490
a stadium and a dynamic geo fence such as

179
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:52,060
wildfire affected area which moves over
time so that Geo fence changes over

180
00:11:52,741 --> 00:11:55,420
time.
So you need to have constant update,

181
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:57,820
updated information about the Geo fences,

182
00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:02,740
which who are the areas which are sort of
no fly zones or the aerospace to avoid.

183
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:08,650
The second function of Utm service would
be the wind and weather integration.

184
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:13,810
So the idea here is that the current
vehicles that operate in that area,

185
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:16,930
this airspace are largely
helicopters and gliders.

186
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:19,420
They have different
susceptibility to wins.

187
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:23,170
Then the 55 pound vehicle
that is going to operate here.

188
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:28,350
So we really need a lot finer grid and
more accurate forecast of the winds so

189
00:12:29,681 --> 00:12:34,240
that we can actually show and make that
information available to all the users

190
00:12:34,241 --> 00:12:38,110
to say which airspace is safe to fly,

191
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:42,820
which is not then congestion management.
As soon as we allow these operations,

192
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:47,590
we expect that demand and capacity could
get off balance in certain locations.

193
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:51,550
And once that happens,
then we need to have ways to manage that.

194
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:56,820
So obviously this is only needed type
of basically feature that it will create

195
00:12:59,441 --> 00:13:03,610
corridors or altitude for direction and
any crossing restrictions based on the

196
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,560
demand and capacity imbalance.

197
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:12,130
The other feature of this
UTM is separation management.

198
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:17,130
Ideally you want all the separation and
collision management to occur on the way

199
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:22,150
called side til the point where we have
vehicles that get smart and can do its

200
00:13:23,111 --> 00:13:27,370
own sense and avoid. There is no reason
necessarily to stop these operations.

201
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:30,640
We can initiate these operations
with number of different construct.

202
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:35,830
First construct it is space reservations
so you can actually file a trajectory

203
00:13:35,831 --> 00:13:37,600
or flight plan and say,
okay,

204
00:13:37,601 --> 00:13:40,960
this airspace is mine and
you complete your use case,

205
00:13:40,961 --> 00:13:43,270
our mission and then
that is space gets open.

206
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:46,990
You can actually notify to the other
operators that I am operating in this

207
00:13:46,991 --> 00:13:48,520
airspace.
I uh,

208
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:53,560
in the future obviously as the density
goes up, that is highly inefficient.

209
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:58,540
So we want to see some kind of vehicle
to vehicle sense and avoid and separation

210
00:13:58,541 --> 00:14:00,490
management,
collision avoidance technologies.

211
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:02,890
And that could happen through sensors.

212
00:14:02,891 --> 00:14:07,891
On board as well as connected systems
through Internet and what we call as we to

213
00:14:07,991 --> 00:14:11,590
V and V to UTM systems,
much like autonomous cars.

214
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:17,140
One of the underpinnings of
that is tracking in the very
remote areas over water.

215
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:21,310
You may not need any tracking
because there is density is very low.

216
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:25,750
You gotta let them fly wherever they
want to fly and they closed the the

217
00:14:25,751 --> 00:14:27,670
trajectory once their
operation is finished.

218
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:31,720
But as you get closer to the congested
airspace, highly constrained airspace,

219
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:36,220
closer to the Geo fence areas,
you want to have sophisticated tracking,

220
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:39,970
the number of options,
cell phone based tracking,

221
00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:41,880
eight years be tracking it,

222
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:45,280
ESB based tracking as Satellite
Cube and k you when tracking.

223
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:50,410
So let's take one, uh, each option at
a time. The cell phone based tracking,

224
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:52,160
which is promising,

225
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:57,350
but currently only roughly 55% of
the land is code by cell phones.

226
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,780
So what do we do about
the rest eight years?

227
00:14:59,781 --> 00:15:03,830
We automatic dependent surveillance base.
Broadcast tracking is also postulated,

228
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:08,660
which also shows promise,
however it has its own limitations.

229
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:13,960
Then the question is what is the best
way most persistent tracking mechanisms?

230
00:15:14,091 --> 00:15:18,390
So some places you may need
combination of three cell phone,

231
00:15:18,530 --> 00:15:23,240
satellite based as well as [inaudible]
tracking to make sure that we know

232
00:15:23,241 --> 00:15:25,160
exactly where the vehicles are.

233
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:30,470
So the idea there is to make sure that
they do not cross geo fences where they

234
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:33,080
shouldn't go.
And uh,

235
00:15:33,090 --> 00:15:37,070
another feature of the UTM is
contingency management. Obviously we,

236
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:41,780
the cost of entry into her space
is gone to zero with these drones,

237
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:46,190
which is really exciting because you
see lots of good applications. However,

238
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:50,780
it also poses some challenges
such as nine one, one,

239
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:55,770
it's possible conceivable that situations
like nine one one could be, uh,

240
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:59,390
could happen with drones.
So how do we actually tackle that?

241
00:15:59,391 --> 00:16:03,650
So you really need to know that which
are the cooperative targets and which are

242
00:16:03,651 --> 00:16:04,880
noncooperative targets.

243
00:16:04,881 --> 00:16:09,050
So you may need a surveillance
system around high value assets.

244
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:14,420
We are also interested in making sure
that the large scale gps as well as cell

245
00:16:14,421 --> 00:16:19,070
phone outage happens. And if that
happens, how do you actually manage that?

246
00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:22,400
So where you call onboard vehicles
will have certain capabilities,

247
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:27,130
simultaneous localization and mapping
and then some kind of basically record

248
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:31,940
path and contingencies that says if you
lose everything then you had about your

249
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:35,540
basically trajectory and
land in a safe place.

250
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:42,690
This cartoon actually gives sort of
an idea what are the different steps

251
00:16:42,691 --> 00:16:46,020
involved in submitting the flight plan.

252
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:51,300
Then checking through the UTM type of
services. Uh, and these are by the way,

253
00:16:51,301 --> 00:16:52,590
not monolithic services.

254
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:56,820
So number of operators can have their
own UTM type of services and they can

255
00:16:56,821 --> 00:17:00,700
connect with each other. Um, so
operator, we'll submit the, the,

256
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:02,760
the flight plan or trajectory.

257
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:08,600
It can be a scheduled one or it can be
on demand than it would system will check

258
00:17:08,611 --> 00:17:10,230
for authentication,

259
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:13,770
make sure that the vehicle and
the operator is authenticated,

260
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,110
then it will check for
all the constraints.

261
00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:19,050
It will check for static as
well as dynamic constraints.

262
00:17:19,290 --> 00:17:22,110
We'll make sure that there
are no contingencies is, uh,

263
00:17:22,111 --> 00:17:26,640
is going through the right air space
and it's not crossing any geo fences and

264
00:17:26,641 --> 00:17:30,360
such. And then operate as
the operation is completed.

265
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:34,980
It will and the mission.
And the airspace will get open.

266
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:36,740
Okay.

267
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:39,290
Then we have four technical capabilities.

268
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:43,850
The way we envision going about
doing this. So it's missing this,

269
00:17:43,851 --> 00:17:45,830
which is interesting.
But uh,

270
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:49,130
nonetheless we finished that
capability so it's less important.

271
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,330
We finished that demonstration.
So we are,

272
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:55,140
the way we go about doing this is
follow, crawl, walk, run strategy.

273
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:59,670
So the idea is each capability targets,
uh, different types of application,

274
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:03,360
geographical area and the,
and the risk associated with that.

275
00:18:03,361 --> 00:18:05,250
So the first capability,

276
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:09,660
which we demonstrated
a in August this year,

277
00:18:09,661 --> 00:18:13,710
last year included a special
reservation as the basic construct.

278
00:18:13,711 --> 00:18:17,400
So you have trajectory planner,
you can file the trajectory,

279
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:22,090
it will check for all the constraints
and that airspace is yours till you close

280
00:18:22,091 --> 00:18:26,750
that trajectory. And it uses either
airspace notification or aerospace,

281
00:18:26,751 --> 00:18:31,040
the reservation as the construct to
notify the other operators where you are

282
00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:35,910
operating. But that was focused
on within visual line of sight.

283
00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:40,350
So the next capability and
the first capability really
targets the remote areas,

284
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:45,590
very low density operations over water
and such a precision agriculture or

285
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:50,880
things like that that operate in a very
remote areas will be supported by this

286
00:18:50,881 --> 00:18:53,730
capability.
The second capability goes,

287
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:59,300
allows us to go beyond visual line of
sight and also offers tracking of these

288
00:18:59,701 --> 00:19:04,350
vehicles through either cell phone,
eight ESB or satellite based Kau band,

289
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:09,480
uh, and again supports low density
operations, sparsely populated areas.

290
00:19:09,810 --> 00:19:13,140
And there will be some basic rules when
there are a number of vehicles operating

291
00:19:13,141 --> 00:19:16,120
at the same time in the same space.
Uh,

292
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:20,760
this will enable the longer
range applications because
it is going beyond visual

293
00:19:20,761 --> 00:19:21,594
line of sight.

294
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:26,720
The third capability adds a separation
management component to that which allows

295
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,040
vehicle to vehicle or,

296
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:32,970
or very cold through
UTM connected systems,

297
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,480
either through internet
or some other means, uh,

298
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:40,520
which allows to have some
basic interaction with a
manned air vehicles as well

299
00:19:40,651 --> 00:19:43,230
as unmanned systems.
So as I mentioned before,

300
00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:47,080
this is the narrative space where you
see some helicopter operations. So,

301
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:52,220
so it's very critical that we have a
system that allows operators to keep away

302
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:56,820
from each other. Fundamentally, we
are after five basic principles.

303
00:19:57,090 --> 00:20:00,210
The first principle is
drones don't hit each other.

304
00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:05,570
Second principle is drones and manned
aviation stay away from each other.

305
00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:11,570
Third one is drone operator has complete
awareness of all the constraints and

306
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:15,690
avoids all the constraints
in the airspace.

307
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:20,400
Fourth principle is drone all the
drone operator as well as the drones

308
00:20:20,401 --> 00:20:22,470
themselves or authenticated.

309
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:27,710
And the fifth principle is drone operators
and drones basically give preference

310
00:20:28,531 --> 00:20:33,270
to a public safety drones and public
safety manned aviation aviation.

311
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:35,520
So though using those principles,

312
00:20:35,521 --> 00:20:39,300
then we go to the basically the subsequent
capabilities and the last capability,

313
00:20:39,301 --> 00:20:44,140
which is the fourth capability that
allows you to operate in the urban high

314
00:20:44,141 --> 00:20:47,860
density is a space where you really
need to worry about large scale

315
00:20:47,861 --> 00:20:52,840
contingencies that we talked about before.
But this is where our vision is.

316
00:20:52,841 --> 00:20:57,130
This is where everybody wants to go to
be able to go to the fourth capability

317
00:20:57,460 --> 00:21:01,990
and allow lots of uses of
drones in the urban airspace.

318
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:07,450
Now the elegance of this approach is
that it is not monolithic system that you

319
00:21:07,451 --> 00:21:10,570
had to actually apply the
entire system everywhere.

320
00:21:10,571 --> 00:21:15,070
This is the way we have organized
this research prototype is in a, uh,

321
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:16,720
using cloud based services.

322
00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:21,220
So multiple providers who would
basically offer different services.

323
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:25,690
You could have multiple operators will
pro, uh, just like I mentioned before,

324
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:28,000
Internet service providers,

325
00:21:28,001 --> 00:21:31,750
you could have airspace service services
providers and they could connect with

326
00:21:31,751 --> 00:21:34,930
each other through a common
application protocol interface.

327
00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:38,980
So multiple providers could
offer similar services.

328
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:43,660
That could be some tailoring
of operational services
based on geographical area.

329
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:48,840
This picture basically shows that if you
are in a remote area or less congested

330
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:51,340
airspace,

331
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:55,180
you could get away with the build one or
technical capability level one type of

332
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:59,530
services. And if you are in a
very congested urban airspace,

333
00:21:59,531 --> 00:22:04,310
you may need higher levels of technical
capabilities and requirements on the way

334
00:22:04,311 --> 00:22:08,680
you call as well as aerospace operations.
So that shows you four,

335
00:22:08,681 --> 00:22:11,770
which is ut on four class
of kind of airspace.

336
00:22:11,950 --> 00:22:16,950
So the elegance again is to try to make
sure that you balance the services that

337
00:22:17,111 --> 00:22:20,590
are needed based on the airspace
where you want to operate.

338
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:24,430
The risks on the ground as well as
the use case that you are after.

339
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:30,250
And vehicle performance and vehicle
characteristics needed across these four

340
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:32,500
technical capabilities is different.

341
00:22:35,710 --> 00:22:40,710
Now the question comes who operates this
airspace and what's the right business

342
00:22:40,841 --> 00:22:43,150
model.
Now different countries,

343
00:22:43,151 --> 00:22:47,860
we have been in discussion with many
countries about how they think this will

344
00:22:47,861 --> 00:22:52,120
evolve in each location and different
countries have different ways of

345
00:22:52,121 --> 00:22:55,420
organizing the businesses
around this UTM construct.

346
00:22:55,780 --> 00:23:00,250
So it could be a single service provider,
like a government entity.

347
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:01,790
Traditional is,

348
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:06,880
is based navigation services that could
provide the service or it could be

349
00:23:08,170 --> 00:23:13,050
multiple service providers at the
local state or county levels, uh,

350
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:17,110
that could operate this.
Or it could be a single service provider,

351
00:23:17,111 --> 00:23:18,550
but the non government entity,

352
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:23,790
or it could be multiple service providers
basically providing services to non

353
00:23:25,481 --> 00:23:30,481
government entities so you can customize
and figure out how we can interoperate

354
00:23:31,301 --> 00:23:33,250
with each other.

355
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:37,840
So that's sort of the basic idea of
there's different business models and as I

356
00:23:37,841 --> 00:23:38,570
mentioned,

357
00:23:38,570 --> 00:23:41,560
the different countries are actually
looking at different types of business

358
00:23:41,561 --> 00:23:44,470
models and fee for service
kind of characterization.

359
00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:50,230
Regardless the regulator will have a
key role in certifying the system and

360
00:23:50,391 --> 00:23:51,730
operations and all cysts,

361
00:23:51,770 --> 00:23:56,450
all UTM systems are there variations
who will interact with each other.

362
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:00,770
So what are the key technologies then,
you know,

363
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:03,800
the question always comes what's missing?
What are the barriers?

364
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:06,110
What are the key technologies
we still need to have?

365
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:10,860
Now these are 55 pound and
below type of vehicles.

366
00:24:10,870 --> 00:24:13,700
So their ability to carry size,
weight,

367
00:24:13,701 --> 00:24:16,490
power is somewhat limited.

368
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:20,030
So we really need to make sure that uh,
that,

369
00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:24,500
that anything that you put on the vehicle
can sustain in terms of size, weight,

370
00:24:24,501 --> 00:24:29,030
power and the cost. So first,
uh, capability, new technology,

371
00:24:29,031 --> 00:24:33,380
key technology is a track and locate
and there could be a combination of the

372
00:24:33,381 --> 00:24:37,400
things that we discussed. Cell phone eight
years be satellite based technologies,

373
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:42,750
a very small basically that can fit on
on the smaller way equal and Kerry and a

374
00:24:43,761 --> 00:24:46,850
payload is small.
The power is a requirement is small,

375
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:51,680
but persistently in track we'll be able
to track the way he calls and their

376
00:24:51,681 --> 00:24:56,330
location since an award. This
is an interesting problem. So,

377
00:24:56,690 --> 00:25:00,200
uh, as you see sense and avoid
technologies evolving everywhere,

378
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:05,470
the ability to carry the sensor packs
on these vehicles is highly limited,

379
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:08,120
which actually offers a lot
of innovative approaches,

380
00:25:08,370 --> 00:25:12,320
a lidar based and vision based
systems that actually have been tried.

381
00:25:12,570 --> 00:25:17,450
And one of the key challenges is too
small objects such as these wires.

382
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:22,720
To be able to see these wires from farther
distance and to be able to basically

383
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:27,220
stay away from them is one of the
key challenges in the sense and avoid

384
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:30,740
technologies because these vehicles
are operating at the lower altitude.

385
00:25:32,210 --> 00:25:36,200
Last and first 50 feet
operation autonomous operations
is another interesting

386
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:37,034
challenge.

387
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:41,540
So what happens is you ideally you want
these vehicles to operate completely

388
00:25:41,541 --> 00:25:45,380
autonomously all the way to the doorstep.
Then the question comes,

389
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:50,000
how are you going to tackle the problem
where grandma is doing landscaping,

390
00:25:50,001 --> 00:25:54,980
kids are running around with soccer ball
and um, there are pets running around.

391
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:57,470
So you need highly intelligent system.

392
00:25:57,590 --> 00:26:02,590
On the vehicle itself that census any
obstacles along the way and basically

393
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:06,560
figure so what to do with it.

394
00:26:06,890 --> 00:26:10,400
There are number of other approaches
which are not necessarily technical.

395
00:26:10,401 --> 00:26:15,401
You could have a thread that drops the
basically what our package you are doing

396
00:26:17,210 --> 00:26:20,660
a we're delivering is one way you
could have a chimney that's raised,

397
00:26:20,930 --> 00:26:23,420
you could how your mailbox raised 10 feet.

398
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:28,310
But nonetheless in the future we would
like to see the last and first 50 feet

399
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,830
operation happening fully autonomously.

400
00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:36,620
Whether sensing and production is another
interesting area where you need a lot

401
00:26:36,621 --> 00:26:39,200
more refined where the
sensing and prediction,

402
00:26:39,410 --> 00:26:44,250
particularly the wind in this airspace
so that the way you call itself can

403
00:26:44,251 --> 00:26:48,030
actually take it or take advantage of
the information and figure out what's the

404
00:26:48,031 --> 00:26:48,631
right path,

405
00:26:48,631 --> 00:26:53,631
what's the right optimal path for that
particular use case and award the areas

406
00:26:53,911 --> 00:26:58,600
that they should avoid. And as I
mentioned before, we see this as a,

407
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:02,400
one of the potential here is that
multiple service providers could actually

408
00:27:02,401 --> 00:27:04,630
offer services for the operator.

409
00:27:04,631 --> 00:27:09,631
So then the idea is to integrate them
through some common application protocol

410
00:27:09,931 --> 00:27:14,610
interface.
In terms of progress,

411
00:27:14,611 --> 00:27:19,230
what we are done so far is that we are
completed technical capability level one

412
00:27:19,530 --> 00:27:23,380
we did demonstration
with 12 partners and the,

413
00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:28,430
we are successfully shown that the basic
construct of airspace notification on

414
00:27:28,711 --> 00:27:29,550
the reservation,

415
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:34,740
it could be adequate for
remote kind of areas, uh,

416
00:27:34,770 --> 00:27:35,520
through the research.

417
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:39,300
Our next step is to basically
continue to evolve this prototype.

418
00:27:39,570 --> 00:27:42,510
So we have been working
with very closely with FFA,

419
00:27:42,770 --> 00:27:46,860
Department of Homeland
Security, Department of Defense,
Department of Interior.

420
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:51,600
We have something we referred to as
research transition team that collaborates

421
00:27:51,601 --> 00:27:53,250
across the government entities.

422
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:58,230
We also have very tight coordination
and collaboration across industry and

423
00:27:58,231 --> 00:27:59,250
academic circles.

424
00:27:59,430 --> 00:28:04,380
We are over 125 collaborators
from industry as well as a career.

425
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:08,130
Uh, we developed the initial
concept to operations.

426
00:28:08,131 --> 00:28:12,480
We demonstrated that we got a lot of
feedback from lots of stakeholders and we

427
00:28:12,481 --> 00:28:14,970
continue to evolve this.
There has been many,

428
00:28:14,971 --> 00:28:19,140
many basically discussions and and uh,

429
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:23,690
simulations as well as testing
of these construct. Uh,

430
00:28:23,730 --> 00:28:27,840
we also released our
application protocol interface.

431
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:31,410
So anybody who wants to collaborate
with us gets a application protocol

432
00:28:31,411 --> 00:28:35,690
interface that allows them to connect
their subsystems as well as the very

433
00:28:35,710 --> 00:28:38,280
cooperations. Uh, as I mentioned,

434
00:28:38,281 --> 00:28:42,570
technical capability level one test will
successfully completed and we have a

435
00:28:42,571 --> 00:28:45,940
huge international interest.
We just got uh,

436
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:51,200
over six international entities that
are really interested in following the

437
00:28:51,871 --> 00:28:56,871
construct of UTM across different
countries and figuring out how they can

438
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,970
benefit from using the construct UTM.

439
00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:02,640
Our next steps.

440
00:29:02,970 --> 00:29:06,840
Basically we'll continue to
evolve this construct of Utm,

441
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:11,190
particularly in going towards
high density urban airspace.

442
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:13,050
Uh,
we want to conduct,

443
00:29:13,051 --> 00:29:18,051
develop a conductor and more research
on the sensors that we really need small

444
00:29:19,831 --> 00:29:24,660
as small as we can get continuous
simulations and test these bills along the

445
00:29:24,661 --> 00:29:29,520
way. We will also continue to work with
industry and other academy and government

446
00:29:29,521 --> 00:29:34,260
groups to refine the concepts and our
assistant architectures are different ways

447
00:29:34,261 --> 00:29:39,090
of organizing the data structures as
well as inter interacting with multiple

448
00:29:39,091 --> 00:29:41,220
operators.
We have a prototype,

449
00:29:41,270 --> 00:29:44,380
then we will continue to
evolve with that till we,

450
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:48,500
we are able to prove that
safe, um, integration, uh,

451
00:29:48,810 --> 00:29:52,450
could occur everywhere.
We also have a national,

452
00:29:52,451 --> 00:29:54,640
a initial campaign,
uh,

453
00:29:54,641 --> 00:29:59,641
focused on creating the UTM kind of
structures are the FAA test sites and

454
00:30:00,191 --> 00:30:03,100
allowing them to do for
the validation of the data.

455
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:09,540
Uh, I would like to show you
an animation of how this,

456
00:30:09,570 --> 00:30:11,110
this system could work.

457
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:02,493
Yeah.

458
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:04,293
Any questions?

459
00:33:04,790 --> 00:33:07,430
How do you think are terrorist
attack employing drones?

460
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:11,120
Would the impact development of
a UTM and [inaudible] in general?

461
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:16,360
Well, obviously, uh, any, any
terrorist attack is a attack is bad.

462
00:33:16,361 --> 00:33:19,200
I need it does search us back. Uh, and,

463
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:24,050
and causes a pause like nine one one.
Um,

464
00:33:24,370 --> 00:33:28,330
but, but I think that is, uh, the,
there are two, two answers to that.

465
00:33:28,331 --> 00:33:31,450
One is that we shouldn't
stop progress. So, you know,

466
00:33:31,451 --> 00:33:33,730
Asian will continue to
occur to a word that,

467
00:33:34,030 --> 00:33:37,310
and second is there are
technologies already in,

468
00:33:37,311 --> 00:33:42,311
in being developed that will detect
uncooperative targets and then figured out

469
00:33:42,971 --> 00:33:47,080
what to do with them. But that's in
the law and order kind of situation.

470
00:33:47,081 --> 00:33:51,600
So the idea here in the
UTM is to figure out, uh,

471
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:52,260
the,

472
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:57,260
a rogue operators or uncooperative objects
that are basically trespassing into

473
00:33:57,551 --> 00:34:00,190
geo fence.
And that's where UTM stops.

474
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:04,000
And there are a number of technologies
are insane service and loyalty do radars

475
00:34:04,330 --> 00:34:09,040
that you may have to have at certain
locations, key assets on the ground. Um,

476
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:13,300
but it could, it could set us
back, uh, but at the same time, uh,

477
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:17,440
this is the time to actually think through
and figure out what systems we need

478
00:34:17,441 --> 00:34:21,110
to be a base we need to put in place to,

479
00:34:21,180 --> 00:34:25,900
to avoid or prevent or basically
manage that kind of situation.

480
00:34:26,390 --> 00:34:27,111
I'm kind of curious,

481
00:34:27,111 --> 00:34:31,090
I was just listening to a podcast
on private plane and drone, um,

482
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:34,760
private companies that are
doing surveillance and a
lot of the problems they

483
00:34:34,761 --> 00:34:39,740
were coming up against were um,
just public opinion and people like,

484
00:34:39,810 --> 00:34:44,000
uh, in cities voting down,
wanting to have that around them.

485
00:34:44,001 --> 00:34:49,001
So just curious what efforts you
guys have going in that direction.

486
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:50,651
Yeah, so, uh,

487
00:34:50,651 --> 00:34:55,651
that's a good question and we collaborated
on with many entities are a number of

488
00:34:57,021 --> 00:35:00,140
things. And so the one of the, of the,

489
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:05,230
the basically our thrust is technical
aerospace operation performance

490
00:35:05,571 --> 00:35:09,920
requirements. So developing that side
of requirements is what we are after.

491
00:35:09,921 --> 00:35:11,330
Obviously we understand the,

492
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:16,420
the barriers are lack of
these technical requirements.

493
00:35:17,090 --> 00:35:20,000
Second is a privacy consideration.

494
00:35:20,001 --> 00:35:23,510
Security considerations as
the previous question. Uh,

495
00:35:23,570 --> 00:35:26,750
public acceptance and policies.
Uh,

496
00:35:26,850 --> 00:35:31,700
we at NASA or not, we are not
working on that particular problem,

497
00:35:31,701 --> 00:35:34,850
but we are collaborating with
number of other entities.

498
00:35:35,130 --> 00:35:40,130
I've heard it as well as non entities to
figure out what is the right way to do

499
00:35:40,171 --> 00:35:41,004
that.

500
00:35:41,410 --> 00:35:43,770
Uh,
in your slide with the business models,

501
00:35:43,771 --> 00:35:46,340
you kind of had different
quadrants of one,

502
00:35:46,590 --> 00:35:50,140
one service provider to rule them
all and then a federated system. Um,

503
00:35:50,370 --> 00:35:52,020
in your discussions in particular,

504
00:35:52,021 --> 00:35:55,890
I'm interested in international
discussions of are the
people falling into that

505
00:35:55,891 --> 00:35:57,510
quadrant somewhere where
they're comfortable?

506
00:35:58,060 --> 00:36:02,380
Yeah, I think, uh, there are
certain countries who are, uh,

507
00:36:02,381 --> 00:36:05,560
who have prioritize operations already,

508
00:36:05,561 --> 00:36:09,360
airspace management ATM. Uh, so they,

509
00:36:09,361 --> 00:36:14,361
they have a preference for different
quarter than some other countries.

510
00:36:15,011 --> 00:36:19,870
So I think really what they are familiar
with, what their safety record is,

511
00:36:19,871 --> 00:36:24,340
what their density of operations and
complexities, we'll make them comfortable.

512
00:36:24,341 --> 00:36:28,810
So different actually quadrons appeal
to different countries based on that.

513
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:33,400
And then the amount of investment that's
needed. So that's a great question, but,

514
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:34,051
uh,
it's,

515
00:36:34,051 --> 00:36:38,610
it's fortunately one size fits
all is not what we are after.

516
00:36:38,611 --> 00:36:42,710
We are basically allowing the
cloud based architecture to,

517
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:46,860
to go in any direction, any quarter
and that a country wants to go.

518
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:53,140
The system is w should be flexible
enough to offer any of these services.

519
00:36:53,970 --> 00:36:57,380
Uh, we've seen a lot of innovation
in UAV over the last few years.

520
00:36:57,590 --> 00:37:01,760
Where do you see hobbyists and startups
falling not just as aviators but as

521
00:37:01,761 --> 00:37:03,950
one's developing control
systems in vehicles?

522
00:37:04,690 --> 00:37:09,250
You are, I think it's been
great. No, I thank you. Uh,

523
00:37:09,850 --> 00:37:12,540
I think it has been great
and mean because of the,

524
00:37:12,810 --> 00:37:17,230
the number of innovators that have entered
into this traditional as well as non

525
00:37:17,231 --> 00:37:19,210
traditional aviation companies.

526
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:24,540
We have seen very rapid development
towards sense and avoid technologies

527
00:37:25,090 --> 00:37:30,090
tracking and locating things and as
well as a assured autonomy for last and

528
00:37:30,551 --> 00:37:34,390
first 50 feet. We are in saw all
the problems, but I think we are,

529
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:39,900
because of the collaboration we have
with number of entities and the interest

530
00:37:41,351 --> 00:37:42,184
that,
uh,

531
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:47,170
that exist and the funding that's gone
into this is unprecedented. I think,

532
00:37:47,171 --> 00:37:50,950
you know, so I see this as a
great sign for aviation. It,

533
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:53,650
it's really exciting to be aviator again.
You know,

534
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:58,040
do we expect to see carve outs in the
air space for people to develop these new

535
00:37:58,041 --> 00:38:01,030
systems or will they have to Polish it,
you know,

536
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:04,070
indoors before it can be released
into the water air space.

537
00:38:04,250 --> 00:38:06,470
Do you, what was the first
sentence, do you see what

538
00:38:06,770 --> 00:38:10,640
a carve out in the air space for people
who are developing new vehicles and new

539
00:38:10,641 --> 00:38:12,170
control systems for vehicles?

540
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:14,510
Oh yeah.
I think there's a lot already.

541
00:38:14,511 --> 00:38:18,890
There are a number of companies
that are developing new systems for,

542
00:38:19,550 --> 00:38:23,150
some of them are developing operating
system for autonomous systems on their

543
00:38:23,151 --> 00:38:27,170
control, new control systems.
So I see a lot of opportunity.

544
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:28,253
Yeah.

545
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:31,610
And if you have ideas we obviously
would like to work with you.

546
00:38:32,930 --> 00:38:33,370
Okay.

547
00:38:33,370 --> 00:38:36,040
So coming at it from a position of being

548
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:36,873
a private pilot,

549
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:41,880
I'm curious your take on how much of
getting this right depends on placing

550
00:38:42,821 --> 00:38:47,740
restrictions that don't exist today
on aircraft. On current aircraft,

551
00:38:47,741 --> 00:38:50,200
like the,
there's no reason for instance,

552
00:38:50,201 --> 00:38:52,960
that other than not having a commercial
license that I can't go fly a crop

553
00:38:52,961 --> 00:38:56,840
duster out a couple hundred feet off
the ground at very high speeds. Uh,

554
00:38:56,841 --> 00:38:59,770
and then you clear a UAV to
fly through my field, uh,

555
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,830
because all of that is
unregulated right now. Uh,

556
00:39:01,850 --> 00:39:04,240
and the same for helicopters and
sightseeing flights and other things.

557
00:39:04,241 --> 00:39:08,470
So it was given that we don't file these
detailed flight plans and get reserved

558
00:39:08,471 --> 00:39:11,530
airspace, uh, for all of
those sorts of operations.

559
00:39:11,531 --> 00:39:13,230
How do we fit uas into all of that?

560
00:39:13,590 --> 00:39:16,110
No, that's a good question. Right. So, uh,

561
00:39:16,510 --> 00:39:20,910
and there are probably different answers
depending on location and their density.

562
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:26,180
Currently the space is regulated but
not control the clause years is where

563
00:39:27,030 --> 00:39:30,800
general aviation largely occurs.
And Yeah,

564
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:34,860
they are not required to file a flight
plan or trajectories, but some of them do.

565
00:39:35,430 --> 00:39:40,000
So one option is that you
have, uh, basically, uh,

566
00:39:40,230 --> 00:39:45,060
the drone operators while trajectories
and through network system,

567
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:47,820
everybody has access to that information.

568
00:39:47,821 --> 00:39:52,200
So even before you take off as a
general elevator, you have, you know,

569
00:39:52,201 --> 00:39:56,160
information as to where the drones
are likely to operate. You know, uh,

570
00:39:56,161 --> 00:39:58,260
other one is basically very tactical,

571
00:39:58,261 --> 00:40:01,860
where both have some kind of way
to coordinate with each other.

572
00:40:01,861 --> 00:40:06,330
We two weeks systems that are evolving
now and keep away from each other. Right?

573
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:11,660
So it's really a function
of density and what kind of,

574
00:40:11,661 --> 00:40:14,160
uh,
our risks we want to mitigate.

575
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:17,910
If there's a huge amount of drone
operations going on, same airspace,

576
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:21,570
obviously you would like to
know that and vice versa. So,

577
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:24,700
um, to the, to the same effective,

578
00:40:24,770 --> 00:40:29,240
if that would basically mean that
in order to avoid hitting drones,

579
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:34,410
you would either by
regulation or by, uh, uh,

580
00:40:35,330 --> 00:40:38,780
preservation of life need to get
additional equipment for your aircraft.

581
00:40:38,910 --> 00:40:39,691
All right,
so the,

582
00:40:39,691 --> 00:40:44,160
I think technology first as my bias,
I,

583
00:40:44,170 --> 00:40:48,840
we try to figure out if we can solve this
problem through technology. You know,

584
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:52,660
obviously there is always the
regulatory aspect. Uh, and,

585
00:40:52,730 --> 00:40:56,820
and that's something that FIS has
to, I mean, you know, think deep,

586
00:40:57,480 --> 00:41:00,690
but, uh, if we can come up with this is
where the innovation, the prior question,

587
00:41:00,691 --> 00:41:01,650
where is the innovation?

588
00:41:01,651 --> 00:41:05,580
This is where one of the possibilities
where we could actually collaboratively

589
00:41:05,610 --> 00:41:08,940
in a way it's something that will actually
help the entire aviation industry.

590
00:41:10,170 --> 00:41:13,140
So the schedule for rolling out,
you had a slide,

591
00:41:13,141 --> 00:41:15,330
the first one was empty and
then you had three more. Uh,

592
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:17,270
it's a fairly aggressive schedule.
Um,

593
00:41:17,310 --> 00:41:21,390
and you mentioned some technologies that
we're going to be potentially use like

594
00:41:21,391 --> 00:41:24,820
slam, which is a very, um, early, um,

595
00:41:24,930 --> 00:41:27,000
very challenging of
David technology to use.

596
00:41:27,001 --> 00:41:32,001
So how do you feel that the
pace of technology and I'm
like processing power and

597
00:41:32,161 --> 00:41:34,040
battery and all those things is going to

598
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:37,160
look in the next five years compared to
the types of regulation that we'd like

599
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:41,600
to be able to enforce? Yeah.
So the schedule that you saw,

600
00:41:41,850 --> 00:41:42,290
um,

601
00:41:42,290 --> 00:41:47,290
I should clarify that that's not
a rollout schedule for operations.

602
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:52,280
That's where we would like to do the test
to understand that require marriage to

603
00:41:52,281 --> 00:41:56,720
operate in the rollout schedule.
Obviously just not up to NASA.

604
00:41:56,721 --> 00:42:01,690
It's really about making sure that we
have all the other issues, you know,

605
00:42:01,790 --> 00:42:06,790
as a previous boss and ask about privacy
in public policy and then making sure

606
00:42:08,031 --> 00:42:11,660
that the FAA has the
regulatory structure in place.

607
00:42:11,661 --> 00:42:16,661
So the rollout schedule will depend
on a lot of other factors then what he

608
00:42:16,731 --> 00:42:21,290
showed. But the slam, I'm going back to
your question about the slam technology.

609
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:26,450
I think, uh, we are hoping that in
four years we are working on some,

610
00:42:26,530 --> 00:42:26,740
uh,

611
00:42:26,740 --> 00:42:31,430
aggressively as well as you guys and
many others on science and award and slam

612
00:42:31,431 --> 00:42:32,001
technology.

613
00:42:32,001 --> 00:42:37,001
So we are hoping that by 2019 we will
have a reasonable prototype technology.

614
00:42:37,161 --> 00:42:41,920
So that's sort of our goal is to try to
push ourselves to get to that point. Um,

615
00:42:42,590 --> 00:42:43,790
is it a risk in that?
Yeah,

616
00:42:43,791 --> 00:42:48,560
it's possible that we may
not get completely a hundred
percent accurate by then,

617
00:42:48,561 --> 00:42:53,540
but I think the goal current indicators
are that we are migrating towards that.

618
00:42:53,630 --> 00:42:55,340
So anyhow,

619
00:42:55,720 --> 00:43:00,470
have thoughts on particular risks in the
technologies or things that we should

620
00:43:00,471 --> 00:43:02,270
be looking at?
Obviously we are open to that.

621
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:03,480
Uh,

622
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:07,380
at the moment we were already seeing a
proliferation of radio technologies with

623
00:43:07,620 --> 00:43:12,270
General Aviation, like you have your
uit transmitters and the 10 90 band. Um,

624
00:43:12,570 --> 00:43:16,070
do we expect, um, UAVs
and drones to have, um,

625
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:19,360
multiple radio technologies
to communicate or, you know,

626
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:22,230
will we just rely on a
central point to coordinate?

627
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:25,920
Yeah, that's a good
question. So we are, uh,

628
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:29,480
we are exploring a number of,
uh,

629
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:34,890
aviation grid as well as currently non
aviation approved technologies like cell

630
00:43:34,891 --> 00:43:38,130
phone based technologies. So, um, you,

631
00:43:38,131 --> 00:43:43,131
what you mentioned about be on the UAT
and UAT technologies of frequencies are

632
00:43:44,851 --> 00:43:46,350
possible there one candidates,

633
00:43:46,380 --> 00:43:50,040
but then they could be cell
phone based possibilities.

634
00:43:50,041 --> 00:43:54,350
So we are exploring that
as well. Uh, we don't,

635
00:43:55,020 --> 00:43:58,950
we don't know exactly how this will a
wall, whether it will consist of multiple,

636
00:43:58,980 --> 00:44:03,980
multiple technologies for
the same platform based on
the altitude or location or

637
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:09,150
all of them may evolve differently.
Thank you so much.
