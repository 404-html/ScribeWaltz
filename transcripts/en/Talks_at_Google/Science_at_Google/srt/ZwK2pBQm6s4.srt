1
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:11,610
Good morning. Thank you all for coming.
It's great to see such a full room today.

2
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:16,590
Uh, I'm delighted to
welcome Dana Staf. Uh,

3
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:21,030
Dennis staff fell in love with
cephalopods at the age of 10. Uh,

4
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:25,470
she began to keep them as pets in a home
aquarium and learned to scuba dive in

5
00:00:25,471 --> 00:00:29,250
order to meet more of them in the wild.
She went on to study.

6
00:00:29,251 --> 00:00:33,480
Pygmy is in Santa Barbara,
cuddle fish in Australia,

7
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:38,990
reef squid in Bermuda and
finally completed her phd
on quote reproduction and

8
00:00:40,021 --> 00:00:43,320
early life of the Humboldt squid or quote,

9
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:46,500
squid sex and babies at Stanford.

10
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:50,160
Her first book titled Squid Empire.

11
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:55,020
The rise and fall of the CEPHALOPODS
has been named one of the best science

12
00:00:55,021 --> 00:00:58,110
books of 2017 by NPR science Friday.

13
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:04,250
She lives in San Jose in the physical
world and that Cephalonia podiatrists.

14
00:01:04,381 --> 00:01:09,250
Dot. Come on mine. Please join me in
welcoming to Google dentist's staff.

15
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:17,000
Thank you so much.
It's really wonderful to be here.

16
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:22,370
No, it was probably hard to take
time away from your work to come.

17
00:01:22,371 --> 00:01:26,870
And I appreciate that everybody was
able to do that to be here and that for

18
00:01:26,871 --> 00:01:30,500
anybody watching it, uh,
remotely or in the future.

19
00:01:30,501 --> 00:01:33,560
Thank you for taking time out of whatever
else you were going to be doing to see

20
00:01:33,561 --> 00:01:36,920
this. Um, I am here to talk
to you about cephalopods,

21
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:39,890
which is a difficult word
to say all by itself.

22
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:44,630
And so we can just call them
squid and octopus and relatives.

23
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:46,070
And in particular,

24
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:51,130
the story that I want to tell about them
is a story that parallels the history

25
00:01:52,161 --> 00:01:53,150
of dinosaurs.

26
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:56,960
And the reason that this particular
story about cephalopods has caught my

27
00:01:56,961 --> 00:02:00,740
attention to the point that I wrote a
whole book about it is that I started to

28
00:02:00,741 --> 00:02:05,060
realize that the, the deep evolutionary
history of squid and octopus is,

29
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:10,240
was even more fascinating then the famous
dinosaurs that we all know and love

30
00:02:11,811 --> 00:02:15,350
from the age of three or four.
And yet nobody knows anything about it.

31
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,880
So I'm going to tell you
today why cephalopods are
even better than dinosaurs.

32
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:25,100
And in particular trying
to spark something that I
like to call the cephalopod

33
00:02:25,101 --> 00:02:25,970
renaissance.

34
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:30,470
And this is a reference to something
called the dinosaur renaissance. Um,

35
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:34,760
that happened in the latter
part of the last century. Uh,

36
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:37,130
we often don't even realize it today,

37
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:42,250
but dinosaurs used to be seen as really
slow and really stupid and really

38
00:02:42,951 --> 00:02:45,170
boring. And that was this. Um,

39
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:49,730
this view up here or this drawing was
done in late 18 hundreds with the view

40
00:02:49,731 --> 00:02:52,400
persisted into the early
19 hundreds as well.

41
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:57,320
The dinosaurs were too heavy to even
walk around. They had to live in swamps.

42
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,180
They were too stupid to survive,

43
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:03,010
so they were already doomed by the time
and asteroid hit and ended their rain.

44
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:03,580
Um,

45
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:08,380
and so no one was actually that interested
in their lives and behavior until a

46
00:03:08,381 --> 00:03:13,381
scientist named Bob backer in the
60s started to describe dinosaurs in

47
00:03:15,071 --> 00:03:19,150
particular one famous dinosaur named
Diana Nicus. And realize that it was,

48
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:22,600
it moved quickly. It was very
active. It was very energetic. Um,

49
00:03:22,601 --> 00:03:27,601
and this actually became the whole view
of dinosaurs that we now know as complex

50
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:33,060
creatures with social lives and behaviors
and all their relationships with birds

51
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:36,430
and the feathers and the warm bloodedness.

52
00:03:36,431 --> 00:03:39,340
And all of this stuff is called the
dinosaur renaissance and gives us this

53
00:03:39,341 --> 00:03:41,030
beautiful view of the,

54
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:45,910
the delightfully ferocious
warm blooded cuddly dinosaurs.

55
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:46,991
Uh,
then we know today,

56
00:03:46,991 --> 00:03:51,400
and of course this dinosaur renaissance
happened in the scientific literature,

57
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:56,770
championed by scientists, but it
quickly seeped out into popular culture,

58
00:03:56,890 --> 00:03:59,140
giving us all of these,
uh,

59
00:03:59,141 --> 00:04:01,900
this is why we have Jurassic
Park and all of its sequels.

60
00:04:01,901 --> 00:04:06,880
This is why we have so many sticker books
full of dinosaurs and video games full

61
00:04:06,881 --> 00:04:07,714
of dinosaurs.

62
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:11,890
It's because there was this shift and
scientific thinking about dinosaurs really

63
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:15,040
realizing how complex and
interesting their lives really were.

64
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:19,390
And so I'm here to show you the same
thing happening with cephalopods,

65
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:24,190
except they're even better. Um, and one
of the ways in which they're even better,

66
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:25,203
um,

67
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:30,480
is that they have so many representatives
around today that we can learn from.

68
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:35,300
Of course, we have representatives of
dinosaurs today. We have birds. Um,

69
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:36,700
and similarly to that,

70
00:04:36,701 --> 00:04:40,270
we can think about what do we have the
squid and octopus that we have today and

71
00:04:40,271 --> 00:04:42,400
what makes them,
what they are.

72
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:47,080
A lot of the things that we think
of our tentacles, um, camouflage,

73
00:04:47,081 --> 00:04:49,990
there's actually a cuddle
fish here hiding in the sand.

74
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:53,500
It's a little arms are coming down
there and it has two little black eyes.

75
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:58,060
The amazing camouflage abilities
of these animals are legendary.

76
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:01,510
And of course they can also score ink if
that doesn't work and they have to get

77
00:05:01,511 --> 00:05:05,650
away quickly. And it's all
connected to their intelligence,

78
00:05:05,651 --> 00:05:09,310
the very large brains, their ability
to coordinate the camouflage,

79
00:05:09,311 --> 00:05:13,120
the behavior to coordinate all of those
arms and tentacles moving together.

80
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:16,630
It all has to be done by a very
complex central nervous system.

81
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:21,190
And these are all the things that we know
and love about cephalopods today about

82
00:05:21,191 --> 00:05:22,240
squid and octopus.

83
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:26,710
And one of the things that is most
fascinating to me about their evolutionary

84
00:05:26,711 --> 00:05:31,711
history is that none of these things
originally made the first cephalopod.

85
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:38,070
The very first cephalopod was
made by a shell of buoyant Shell.

86
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:44,650
And that was what separated the early
cephalopods from all of the other snails

87
00:05:44,651 --> 00:05:48,550
and mollusks and other clams and things
that were living on the sea floor.

88
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:51,670
And to understand how this
happened, we have to go way, way,

89
00:05:51,671 --> 00:05:55,960
way back in time because cephalopods
are twice as old as dinosaurs.

90
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:59,480
So we have to go before humans obviously.

91
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:04,280
But also way back before the dinosaurs
and way that before there was anything on

92
00:06:04,281 --> 00:06:07,790
land. So we're now talking
500 million years ago.

93
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:11,680
Land is completely
barren except for algae.

94
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,000
I the only psychologists
cologists in the audience.

95
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:16,220
He didn't even know if psychology is,
it's great.

96
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:19,730
This is the study of algae and I always
feel bad saying that there's nothing on

97
00:06:19,731 --> 00:06:24,731
land because technically there were some
little cells of algae swooshing around

98
00:06:24,741 --> 00:06:27,020
here and there, but there was
nothing large and interesting.

99
00:06:27,021 --> 00:06:29,480
Everything large and
interesting was in the ocean.

100
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:34,970
And this is what it looked like. Try
the whites mostly, um, and more algae,

101
00:06:34,971 --> 00:06:38,520
but larger LG this time, all
of these big plants here, um,

102
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:42,830
and almost everything was on the
sea floor. So even underwater,

103
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:45,770
there weren't any large
animals swimming around.

104
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:49,970
This is way before fish and sharks,
no marine reptiles, no marine mammals.

105
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:54,230
And so anything that was swimming was
just kind of a little shrimpy thing and

106
00:06:54,231 --> 00:06:59,231
most of the large animals were crawling
on or burrowing in or scrabbling around

107
00:07:00,321 --> 00:07:03,620
over the sea floor because that was
the interesting place where all of the

108
00:07:03,621 --> 00:07:04,970
interactions were taking place.

109
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:10,310
And one little fellow who was doing
this along with everybody else is this

110
00:07:10,311 --> 00:07:14,690
little snail like creature that's thought
to be one of the first cephalopods are

111
00:07:14,691 --> 00:07:16,790
the first ancestors of cephalopods.

112
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:22,060
And the shell of this little fellow
shows us how they became the wondrous

113
00:07:23,811 --> 00:07:28,200
creatures that they turned into.
And it happened because this is,

114
00:07:28,201 --> 00:07:30,470
this is diagrams,
cross sections of the shell.

115
00:07:30,471 --> 00:07:33,800
So here's our little friend still
smooching around on the sea floor,

116
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:37,730
but you can see that inside the
shell there are some little chambers.

117
00:07:37,731 --> 00:07:41,660
The chamber is filled with the
yellow color, are sectioned off,

118
00:07:41,661 --> 00:07:45,650
separated from the rest of the animal,
and they're filled with buoyant gas.

119
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:51,020
And once enough of those chambers formed
the gas and then was able to offset the

120
00:07:51,021 --> 00:07:54,920
weight of the Shell and the weight of
the animal and lift it right up into the

121
00:07:54,921 --> 00:07:57,200
water column.
So that's what you see at the top.

122
00:07:57,201 --> 00:08:01,970
There is the first real true cephalopod
that had a chambered shell with buoyant

123
00:08:01,971 --> 00:08:03,200
gas inside the chambers.

124
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:06,770
It was able to move around in the water
column and there were some of the first

125
00:08:06,771 --> 00:08:10,460
animals to really be swimmers.
And not only were they swimmers,

126
00:08:10,461 --> 00:08:15,461
but they could get enormous because
once the shell is no longer heavy,

127
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:19,910
now the shell carries
its own buoyancy with it.

128
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:22,370
It can get arbitrarily large.
Um,

129
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:26,940
and so cephalopods literally rose above
the competition. I like to say this, um,

130
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:33,040
this is a very authentic drying of the
early Ordovician seas except for the

131
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:36,170
scuba diver who's sort of out of place,

132
00:08:36,171 --> 00:08:41,000
but she's just there to show scale to
show you how incredibly large these

133
00:08:41,001 --> 00:08:46,001
animals got this straight shelled
cephalopods are going off of the screen.

134
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:50,780
They were large enough that the shells
would have reached the entire length of

135
00:08:50,781 --> 00:08:54,570
this room. And then we don't
even know if they had tentacles,

136
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:57,990
how many tentacles they had,
how long those tentacles might've been.

137
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:01,920
So they really were some
of the first sea monsters,

138
00:09:01,921 --> 00:09:05,010
the first sea monsters in the whole ocean,

139
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:09,840
which meant in the whole world because
there was still nothing large on land.

140
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:12,450
And so on top here again with a,

141
00:09:12,451 --> 00:09:17,040
at this time with a snappily dressed
men for scale. Um, we have camera,

142
00:09:17,041 --> 00:09:21,390
Sarah's one of those really long s child,
straight shelled early cephalopods. Um,

143
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:26,040
and then this curl shelled cephalopod
down here as that type of cephalopod cut

144
00:09:26,041 --> 00:09:28,310
an ammonite that lived much later.
Um,

145
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:31,830
that one actually lived in the oceans at
the same time as dinosaurs were living

146
00:09:31,831 --> 00:09:35,370
on land. It's Thea sores were swimming
around. If they were big enough,

147
00:09:35,371 --> 00:09:36,780
they were probably
trying to eat these guys.

148
00:09:36,781 --> 00:09:38,800
Moses sores were probably eating them.
Um,

149
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:42,390
and you can see that the shells got
large enough that a person could climb

150
00:09:42,391 --> 00:09:43,650
inside of that Shell.

151
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:48,420
They were really tremendous throughout
the hundreds of millions of years that

152
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:50,640
they lived in the ocean.
And for most of this time,

153
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:55,790
they all had these big shells that carried
their own buoyancy around with them.

154
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:57,000
And so they were,

155
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,080
they were sort of freed up
to move wherever they wanted
to be as large as they

156
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,000
could possibly evolve to be.

157
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:07,440
And they were living there doing
all of this at the same time,

158
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:11,430
both long before and also at the same
time as the dinosaurs were doing all of

159
00:10:11,431 --> 00:10:12,600
their crazy things on land.

160
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:17,780
And then what really blows my mind is
that they faced extinction at the same

161
00:10:18,361 --> 00:10:19,110
time,

162
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:23,880
at the end of the Cretaceous
when an asteroid smashed
into the planet and all of

163
00:10:23,881 --> 00:10:25,890
the non avian dinosaurs went extinct.

164
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:30,450
So did most of the cephalopods
it was a very bad day.

165
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:34,730
They don't know exactly what happened.
Um,

166
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:38,610
we do know that the asteroid hit
that it changed the global climate.

167
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:43,710
It probably acidified the surface
areas of the oceans tremendously. Um,

168
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:46,230
there were probably lots of
fires all over the place.

169
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:49,170
It's still a matter of active research.

170
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:54,360
Why this really bad day cause
such specific extinctions?

171
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:57,660
Because you remember not
everything went extinct.

172
00:10:57,661 --> 00:11:01,530
It was not a really bad day for everybody.
We still have all of our birds,

173
00:11:01,531 --> 00:11:03,090
all of our avian dinosaurs,

174
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:07,680
and we still have all of our squid and
octopus and Nautilus and cuddle fish that

175
00:11:07,681 --> 00:11:08,790
we talked about.
Uh,

176
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:12,270
and so this is a very interesting
question about why some of these animals

177
00:11:12,271 --> 00:11:16,590
survived one of the worst days on the
planet and so many others went extinct.

178
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:21,750
And it makes it very interesting to study
both of these large famous groups that

179
00:11:21,751 --> 00:11:26,640
faced extinction, the dinosaurs and
the cephalopods. Now I have to wonder.

180
00:11:26,641 --> 00:11:30,450
So cephalopods were huge ancient monsters.

181
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:34,680
They live before the dinosaurs and
through the time of the dinosaurs and they

182
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:37,050
had a horrible,

183
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:42,030
massive murder mystery extinction at the
same time. So why aren't they as cool?

184
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:43,950
Why don't we know as much?
I mean they are as cool,

185
00:11:43,951 --> 00:11:47,280
but why don't we think there is cool?
Why don't we know as much about them? Um,

186
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:50,850
and the interesting thing is the sort
of fossils they leave are extremely

187
00:11:50,851 --> 00:11:54,040
different from the sort of fossils
that dinosaur leaves a dinosaur leaves.

188
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:58,090
Interestingly, cephalopod fossils
are actually way more abundant.

189
00:11:58,270 --> 00:12:03,040
So this is just a picture here of a single
rock that's crammed with these coiled

190
00:12:03,041 --> 00:12:06,640
ammonites. These are ancient
cephalopods, um, that,

191
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:08,890
that lived around the same
time as the dinosaurs.

192
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:13,090
If these coiled shells and they're just
the fossilized everywhere. This is,

193
00:12:13,091 --> 00:12:14,740
you know,
single dinosaur thighbone,

194
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:18,370
which is always a very exciting find
to find even one bone from a dinosaur

195
00:12:18,371 --> 00:12:22,510
skeleton. And you would think that
if they're fossils are more abundant,

196
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:24,190
we would know more about them.

197
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:28,750
But the abundance of their fossils
caused an interesting situation for many,

198
00:12:28,751 --> 00:12:29,584
many years,

199
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:33,940
which is their fossils are so abundant
that geologists just used them as

200
00:12:33,941 --> 00:12:37,170
timestamps.
This is a picture of sort of a,

201
00:12:37,171 --> 00:12:41,770
a cross section through rocks showing
you how rocks get deposited in layers and

202
00:12:41,771 --> 00:12:43,540
then they,
the layers get eroded.

203
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:46,210
So if you go out digging for
fossils in different places,

204
00:12:46,211 --> 00:12:48,640
you'd might take few different
layers and find different fossils.

205
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:49,900
And in this case,

206
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:55,150
these fossils are showing you that even
if you dig in very different places in

207
00:12:55,151 --> 00:13:00,130
the world, you might find the same fossils
from place to place. And that can help,

208
00:13:00,131 --> 00:13:00,850
you know,

209
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:05,080
the age of the rocks that you're digging
in and those fossils that are reliable

210
00:13:05,081 --> 00:13:07,780
enough to tell you the age
of the rocks are digging in.

211
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:10,930
And those are called index fossils.
And many,

212
00:13:10,931 --> 00:13:15,520
many index fossils are cephalopods are
ammonites and the relatives of squid

213
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:20,020
because there so abundant there are so
diverse and there's so easily recognized.

214
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:21,910
A single shell,
uh,

215
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:25,660
can be identified to species quite easily
by counting the ribs and figuring out,

216
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:27,790
um, various, uh,

217
00:13:27,791 --> 00:13:30,580
just taking morphometrics basically
doing little measurements and saying it's

218
00:13:30,581 --> 00:13:34,290
wider than it is tall or
it's fatter than it is tall.

219
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:37,000
And all of these things
will give you the species.

220
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:41,080
And so for a long time geologists were
like, these are super useful rocks.

221
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:45,370
They're the most useful rocks in
the world, but they're not animals.

222
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:49,510
Nobody was thinking about what were
these things doing when they were alive,

223
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:51,070
ecologically speaking,

224
00:13:51,071 --> 00:13:55,630
why did they evolve these crazy
shapes and these intricate lines.

225
00:13:55,810 --> 00:13:56,431
And some of them are,

226
00:13:56,431 --> 00:13:59,680
were spiky and some of them were
tiny and some of them were big.

227
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:02,800
And nobody really thought about those
questions because they were just so useful

228
00:14:02,801 --> 00:14:03,670
as timestamps.

229
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:08,680
And then this book was published
in 2001 called the ammonites.

230
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:10,060
That's a really little book.

231
00:14:10,061 --> 00:14:15,061
It was published by a couple of people
at the natural history museum in London.

232
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:19,000
And they just asked a very simple
question, what might these ammonites,

233
00:14:19,001 --> 00:14:22,060
these ancient cephalopods have
looked like when they were alive?

234
00:14:22,061 --> 00:14:24,160
And more importantly,
what were they doing?

235
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:26,740
What were they eating
and who is eating them?

236
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:31,770
And this was kind of a first step towards
creating Diorama's like fourth grade

237
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,280
or was everywhere do with dinosaurs.

238
00:14:33,281 --> 00:14:36,880
And you have the t rex jumping on the
triceratops and taking large bites out of

239
00:14:36,881 --> 00:14:39,520
it. Um, and after this book was published,

240
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:43,270
people started publishing illustrations
like this and their scientific papers

241
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:47,230
actually trying to recreate the animals
and think what would they have been

242
00:14:47,231 --> 00:14:51,990
doing? This particular animal
up here is a kind of, um,

243
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:56,600
uh, kind of ammonite that grows a Greek
curved shell, sort of like a paper clip.

244
00:14:56,870 --> 00:15:00,380
And it's been puzzling scientists
for a really long time thinking,

245
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:03,950
what did they do? Why would they
bend their shell back again?

246
00:15:03,951 --> 00:15:07,990
It seems like it would be really
awkward for swimming. And then, um,

247
00:15:08,330 --> 00:15:11,840
this is crazy Russian scientist named
Sasha I kept getting was like, well,

248
00:15:11,841 --> 00:15:15,410
maybe they just used it like a paperclip.
If it's shaped like a paper clip,

249
00:15:15,411 --> 00:15:16,670
maybe it works like a paperclip.

250
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:20,510
And why didn't they just hook themselves
onto some kelp or some underwater

251
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:24,730
driftwood and live there?
And we have a very sedentary
life, um, and the, you know,

252
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:27,110
then, and so he drew this
picture and that got published.

253
00:15:27,111 --> 00:15:31,250
And then other scientists published
angry diatribes showing why that couldn't

254
00:15:31,251 --> 00:15:32,240
possibly be the case.

255
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:36,770
And it was great because science has been
proceeding by leaps and bounds because

256
00:15:36,771 --> 00:15:39,110
people are actually thinking,
talking about it,

257
00:15:39,111 --> 00:15:42,350
building models to see what can happen.
Um,

258
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:48,250
and so the other thing that is helping
to move this forward is not just the

259
00:15:49,011 --> 00:15:52,190
shift in perspective that
people are finally thinking
about what they would have

260
00:15:52,191 --> 00:15:55,370
looked like, what the cephalopod Diorama's
of the deep sea should look like.

261
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:58,010
But there are new ways
to look at the fossils.

262
00:15:58,011 --> 00:16:02,330
So technology has proceeded to the point
where we can get more information out

263
00:16:02,331 --> 00:16:03,410
of those old fossils.

264
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:07,970
And all of these fossils that I
showed you are all well and good.

265
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:11,540
They're beautiful, it's easy to
count ribs and things like that,

266
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:14,780
but it doesn't tell you very much
about what the animal was like.

267
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:19,400
If you look at an articulated
skeleton of a TRX or a Brontosaurus,

268
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:23,720
you can dream flesh onto it pretty easily.
You see where the neck was,

269
00:16:23,721 --> 00:16:27,140
you see how many legs it had.
You see how long it's tail was.

270
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:32,120
But all of the soft parts of a cephalopod
are totally missing from this kind of

271
00:16:32,121 --> 00:16:32,900
fossil.

272
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:37,900
They're just gone and we have no idea
where their mouth was or what number of

273
00:16:38,511 --> 00:16:41,460
tentacles they might've had. But now, um,

274
00:16:42,590 --> 00:16:47,590
paleontologists are making friends with
medical imagery technicians and putting

275
00:16:48,141 --> 00:16:49,760
rocks in two CT scanners,

276
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:53,360
which I'm told is like
everybody's favorite thing
when they go to the hospital

277
00:16:53,361 --> 00:16:56,900
and find that there are fossils being
run through the CT scanner and everybody

278
00:16:56,901 --> 00:16:59,510
gathers around to see what's going on.
Uh,

279
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:03,470
because the great thing is if you
look inside these kinds of fossils,

280
00:17:03,530 --> 00:17:07,700
you can actually start to get information
about the soft parts that's missing.

281
00:17:08,050 --> 00:17:13,010
Um, and in this case, this
particular fossil was a
straight shell, the cephalopod.

282
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:14,150
Um,
and they are,

283
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:18,320
the CT scanner is not yet finding
how many tentacles it had,

284
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:23,540
but it is finding the mouth and there's
some pretty stunning images coming out.

285
00:17:23,570 --> 00:17:28,040
This is straight out
of a paper in science,

286
00:17:28,041 --> 00:17:31,220
which is like science papers
are incredibly condensed.

287
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:34,520
So I'm sorry to show you this image
that's like, ah, too much information.

288
00:17:34,521 --> 00:17:37,010
But basically a on top,

289
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:40,820
that's a picture of the straight shell
that was put in the CT scanner. Um,

290
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:46,030
B shows you a sort of cross sectional
view of what sort of the beginning of the

291
00:17:46,731 --> 00:17:49,220
mouth might've looked
like inside that Shao.

292
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:54,710
And then these shapes here that you're
seeing are the tongue of the animal.

293
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:56,640
CEPHALOPODS,

294
00:17:56,700 --> 00:18:01,260
squid and octopus and all of their
cousins have these really complex tongues

295
00:18:01,261 --> 00:18:03,390
with a lot of teeth on
them called gradular.

296
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:07,680
And these tongues of these ancient
cephalopod seem to have been really,

297
00:18:07,681 --> 00:18:08,730
really complex.

298
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:13,730
They were these sort of folded up origami
shapes with little tongues all over

299
00:18:13,831 --> 00:18:18,630
them that look like they could have
been unfolded and used almost like a

300
00:18:18,631 --> 00:18:23,631
spider's Web to catch plankton to catch
little particles and little animals and

301
00:18:24,241 --> 00:18:28,230
things in the open ocean. So
this tells us all, and this,

302
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:29,960
this here is,
um,

303
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:34,000
sort of a three d reconstruction
of how that might have this, uh,

304
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,850
colorful part up there is the regular,

305
00:18:35,890 --> 00:18:40,850
that tongue being unfolded
slowly from kind of a base, uh,

306
00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:43,790
job base where it would have
sat inside the animal. Uh,

307
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:47,250
and so this is really abstract
for most of us to look at,

308
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:51,270
but fortunately there are artists who
work with scientists to then make,

309
00:18:51,271 --> 00:18:53,480
because reconstructions like this,
uh,

310
00:18:53,530 --> 00:18:56,010
which doesn't show you the
Radleigh unfortunately,

311
00:18:56,011 --> 00:19:01,011
but it is showing you this beak out of
which the fragile or would have unfolded.

312
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:06,230
And the whole structure of the Enamel is
based around that knowledge of it being

313
00:19:06,871 --> 00:19:10,260
something that eats plankton.
A lot of other reconstructions,

314
00:19:10,261 --> 00:19:13,470
think of these ancient animals
as being active predators.

315
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:15,840
Carnivores like squid
and octopus are today.

316
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:19,800
But this discovery of that complicated
Radleigh that would've just filtered

317
00:19:19,801 --> 00:19:24,660
plankton out of the water has helped a
new interpretation arise thinking like,

318
00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:29,010
okay, they didn't have really long arms
that were muscular for grabbing food.

319
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:31,800
They just had this
little web of arms maybe,

320
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:37,100
and then this beat that could open up
and sort of slurp up all of the little

321
00:19:37,531 --> 00:19:39,360
yummy bits and pieces.
And they probably,

322
00:19:39,361 --> 00:19:42,100
this protein at least would not have
been a very good swimmer and would,

323
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:45,540
would've just sort of gently drifted here.
And they're picking up food,

324
00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:48,960
which is a different thing that
none of the living cephalopods do.

325
00:19:48,961 --> 00:19:52,440
There aren't really any plankton
feeding squid or octopus is,

326
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:55,260
they tend to be mostly active predators.
And so in a way,

327
00:19:55,261 --> 00:19:59,850
it's sort of like looking at each
dinosaurs and being like, well,

328
00:19:59,851 --> 00:20:02,340
we don't really have any t rexes anymore.

329
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:06,270
But if you can imagine a chicken
getting that big and being carnivorous,

330
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:09,330
and what would it be like? Um, so this,

331
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:14,360
this sort of a nuanced ability to
interpret the fossils is really growing.

332
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:19,800
I'm creating what seems to me to be
a wonderful time for a cephalopod

333
00:20:19,801 --> 00:20:24,120
renaissance for the extinct cephalopods.
Um, and these are more artists,

334
00:20:24,121 --> 00:20:29,100
reconstructions that are a little bit more
fantastical, but again, like dinosaurs,

335
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:31,500
we don't really have any
idea what color they were,

336
00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:35,610
so paleo artists can just
kind of go wild with it. Um,

337
00:20:35,611 --> 00:20:39,120
and all of these shapes
are completely realistic.

338
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:44,150
There are ancient cephalopod fossils
that grew in corkscrews with spikes that

339
00:20:44,731 --> 00:20:46,080
had these weird recurve,

340
00:20:46,081 --> 00:20:49,690
this is sort of a cousin of the paperclip
wine over here that just were super

341
00:20:49,691 --> 00:20:50,930
irregular knots.
Um,

342
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:54,430
and we still tend to forget why they
had all these super weird shapes.

343
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:59,500
And while paleontologists are working
on this to figure out what was going on,

344
00:20:59,710 --> 00:21:04,710
it's kind of a perfect time for the
public to become excited about cephalopods

345
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:10,230
because all of our modern cephalopod squid
and octopus around us today are going

346
00:21:11,201 --> 00:21:12,250
through boom times.

347
00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:17,670
There's what's been referred to as a
global proliferation of cephalopods and

348
00:21:18,671 --> 00:21:23,671
these fingers here are from a paper that
was published in 2016 that was kind of

349
00:21:23,861 --> 00:21:27,460
a review paper gathering
data from fisheries.

350
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:31,860
And from scientific surveys,
from uh,

351
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:34,030
octopus's cuddle fish,
squid,

352
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:38,500
ones that live close to the shore and
ones that live further out and in the deep

353
00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:42,670
and showing that all of them
average together are trending up.

354
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:45,580
And we are living in a very,
um,

355
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:49,000
we're very bullish on cephalopods
and the oceans these days.

356
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:54,240
And the reason seems to be that all of
these animals have evolved away from that

357
00:21:56,411 --> 00:22:00,760
heavy shell. They don't have
a big external shell anymore.

358
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:05,620
And it's created an extremely flexible
group of animals because they can grow

359
00:22:05,621 --> 00:22:08,160
quickly. They don't have
to build a heavy shell. Um,

360
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:11,620
they have a lot of babies that can
adapt very quickly to their changing

361
00:22:11,621 --> 00:22:12,430
environment.

362
00:22:12,430 --> 00:22:16,390
And that adaptability and flexibility
seems to be a lot of what's driving this.

363
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:17,140
Boom.

364
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:20,920
That and the fact that humans have been
fishing a lot of their main predators

365
00:22:20,921 --> 00:22:24,190
out of the ocean. And so
they're, they're sort of a like,

366
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:29,540
thanks for removing all of the fish
and now we will go wild situation. Uh,

367
00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:33,070
and of course there are t shirts
that you can buy celebrating this,

368
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:36,550
a dominance of the cephalopods I
forgot to wore wear mine today,

369
00:22:36,551 --> 00:22:39,730
but you can look them up online.
However,

370
00:22:40,510 --> 00:22:44,980
there are always some exceptions to
this sort of optimistic view of the

371
00:22:44,981 --> 00:22:46,210
cephalopod future.

372
00:22:46,810 --> 00:22:51,160
And I have to mention that there are a
few species that are not doing especially

373
00:22:51,161 --> 00:22:56,161
well that are actually listed
as endangered and they are
deep sea octopus's that

374
00:22:56,710 --> 00:23:01,710
live in the deep cold waters where they
take a very long time to grow and they

375
00:23:02,801 --> 00:23:05,950
reproduce only a few eggs.
And worst of all,

376
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:08,920
they happen to have neighbors
that are very delicious.

377
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:12,250
So even though you've probably never
heard of these octopuses that they don't

378
00:23:12,251 --> 00:23:15,710
have common names because nobody
talks about them commonly. Um,

379
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:20,760
but they live on sea mounts in the deep
sea where orange roughy fish and Scampi

380
00:23:21,341 --> 00:23:24,550
shrimp also live.
And people like to eat those things.

381
00:23:24,551 --> 00:23:28,540
And when people throw down nets into the
deep sea to get the shrimp and the fish,

382
00:23:28,690 --> 00:23:30,460
they also catch these octopuses.

383
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:34,270
And that's why these particular species
are considered endangered is because

384
00:23:34,271 --> 00:23:37,650
many of them have been accidentally
brought up in these nets and that

385
00:23:37,651 --> 00:23:39,640
populations are suffering.
Um,

386
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:44,700
and even the squid that
are booming throughout the
oceans and doing really well

387
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:48,130
have some risks.
Um,

388
00:23:48,390 --> 00:23:53,390
these are a couple of papers that came
out showing that there are problems with

389
00:23:53,631 --> 00:23:57,800
ocean acidification affecting
the early development of squid.

390
00:23:57,950 --> 00:24:00,560
So even though right now they
seem to be doing really well,

391
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:02,360
the oceans are changing,

392
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:05,960
they're getting warmer and warmer and
the water is getting more and more acidic

393
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:11,260
and those things might in the near future
cause that boom trajectory to flatten

394
00:24:11,781 --> 00:24:15,380
out or even get depressed a little
bit depending on how things change,

395
00:24:15,650 --> 00:24:19,610
how much we decided to change things
or not let them go on as normal.

396
00:24:19,970 --> 00:24:24,860
And then of course we still have one
cephalopod with an external shell,

397
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:30,060
not less. So how are they doing?
Well, I think of Nautilus as,

398
00:24:30,061 --> 00:24:34,100
as sort of a cautionary tale
because there's so beautiful,

399
00:24:34,101 --> 00:24:35,960
they still have that external shell there,

400
00:24:35,961 --> 00:24:40,880
the last cephalopod with an external
shell and they have these beautiful tiger

401
00:24:40,881 --> 00:24:44,480
stripes. And you can
buy them anywhere. Uh,

402
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:47,720
it turns out they're not
even very expensive. Um,

403
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:52,460
which is a problem because if you can
buy them anywhere and people will pull

404
00:24:52,461 --> 00:24:56,540
them out of the ocean more and more to
make money and then there won't be any

405
00:24:56,541 --> 00:24:57,500
Novelis's anymore.

406
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:02,930
And this has become enough of a
problem that in 2017, uh, Sadie's,

407
00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:03,290
the,

408
00:25:03,290 --> 00:25:07,910
which is the international treaty that
regulates all the big endangered species

409
00:25:07,911 --> 00:25:09,170
like Rhinoceros,

410
00:25:09,170 --> 00:25:12,770
Horn and elephant tusks has decided to
start regulating the trade and Novelis

411
00:25:12,771 --> 00:25:16,510
shells as well. Um, which
is very encouraging and, uh,

412
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:21,080
it's being considered for being listed
on the endangered species act here in the

413
00:25:21,081 --> 00:25:25,640
u s which would also cause
more protections to be put
in place so fewer of them

414
00:25:25,641 --> 00:25:28,160
could be important and um,

415
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:33,290
and it would hopefully lead to and
longer survival time for this lineage of

416
00:25:33,291 --> 00:25:36,830
shelled cephalopods. The last
ones with that buoyant shell. Um,

417
00:25:36,831 --> 00:25:38,360
and this listing or this,

418
00:25:38,450 --> 00:25:42,980
this possibility of listing cephalopods
here is open for public comment. And, um,

419
00:25:43,010 --> 00:25:45,920
and I went and read all of the public
comments that people had posted in.

420
00:25:45,921 --> 00:25:48,490
One of them in particular
struck me that thought I would,

421
00:25:48,610 --> 00:25:49,311
I would bring it to you.

422
00:25:49,311 --> 00:25:53,330
This is a neuro ethologists named hiking
new mice to it's a neuropathologist

423
00:25:53,331 --> 00:25:57,320
means she studies brain and behavior
and how those things are connected.

424
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:02,030
And she commented that Nautilus
represents a window to the past,

425
00:26:02,290 --> 00:26:06,170
a unique opportunity to understand
the evolution of the brain,

426
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:08,270
including its vulnerability.

427
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:11,420
It's protection is not
only important for us,

428
00:26:11,450 --> 00:26:14,390
but indeed is a moral
imperative for mankind.

429
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:19,970
So she was of the opinion that she was
presenting this idea that because we have

430
00:26:19,971 --> 00:26:24,971
nautilus is still around today and because
their history goes back 500 million

431
00:26:25,941 --> 00:26:27,530
years before the dinosaurs,

432
00:26:27,770 --> 00:26:32,210
they are really the a one of a kind
opportunity to understand how this

433
00:26:32,211 --> 00:26:37,211
incredible brain that we see an octopus
and squid how would evolve in contrast

434
00:26:37,850 --> 00:26:39,750
to other members of the species.
Um,

435
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:45,310
and so I think this is a really
beautiful way to connect the study of the

436
00:26:46,141 --> 00:26:51,000
ancient cephalopods and my mission to
get everybody to find them to be just as

437
00:26:51,001 --> 00:26:55,020
cool as dinosaurs with what's going on
currently with the living cephalopods

438
00:26:55,021 --> 00:26:59,670
that we have here today.
It's a really deep lineage here.

439
00:26:59,671 --> 00:27:04,671
This is the history going all the way
back to the Cambrian 500 million years

440
00:27:05,071 --> 00:27:05,610
ago.

441
00:27:05,610 --> 00:27:10,610
Here's our old buddy with the very first
little chambers in its shell all the

442
00:27:11,641 --> 00:27:13,980
way through the really
long straight shelled ones.

443
00:27:13,981 --> 00:27:18,360
This is not exactly to scale because I
didn't have just sort of infinite room to

444
00:27:18,361 --> 00:27:22,920
go off here. Uh, and the, and
then the early coiled cephalopods,

445
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:28,070
all these super weird shapes of amyloids
that proliferated and then went extinct

446
00:27:28,201 --> 00:27:29,610
at the end of the Cretaceous.

447
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:34,880
And you'll see over here that the Nautilus
has been just chugging along from its

448
00:27:34,921 --> 00:27:39,921
ancestors all the way back here
towards really the root of the tree.

449
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:44,940
And it's still a lot of open questions,
a lot of mystery.

450
00:27:44,941 --> 00:27:49,050
Why do they have they changed in a way
that we can't tell from the fossils?

451
00:27:49,051 --> 00:27:52,890
Are they really these unchanged
living fossils. There's a lot of, uh,

452
00:27:52,910 --> 00:27:55,470
of interesting work to be done there.
And meanwhile,

453
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:58,500
all of the other cephalopods
the octopus is this squid.

454
00:27:58,650 --> 00:28:01,980
The cuddle fish are doing
all of their own things.

455
00:28:01,981 --> 00:28:04,860
A beautiful proliferation that
we're seeing in the oceans today.

456
00:28:05,070 --> 00:28:07,170
And by comparing all of this stuff,

457
00:28:07,171 --> 00:28:11,100
all of the deep time history with
all of the modern diversity, um,

458
00:28:11,130 --> 00:28:11,851
we're really in a,

459
00:28:11,851 --> 00:28:15,030
in a beautiful place to understand
this group like never before.

460
00:28:15,870 --> 00:28:20,850
And it's a group that is uniquely suited
to sort of shedding light on all of

461
00:28:20,851 --> 00:28:25,851
life on earth because it's really the
farthest group from us primates that has

462
00:28:26,731 --> 00:28:30,450
developed intelligence and curiosity
and problem solving skills.

463
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:34,350
And by comparing the way we do those
things with the way cephalopods do those

464
00:28:34,351 --> 00:28:37,320
things, we can really get
a holistic understanding.

465
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:43,350
So I just wanted to thank you all finally
for coming and take some questions.

466
00:28:48,030 --> 00:28:48,863
Okay.

467
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:53,550
All right. Thanks a lot for the
great talk. Uh, I had a question.

468
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:58,320
How hard would it be to
breeding farm nautilus? Ah,

469
00:28:58,420 --> 00:29:01,180
the Brie, the question is how hard
would it be to breed nautilus? Yes.

470
00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:01,891
Because the,

471
00:29:01,891 --> 00:29:06,290
you were saying that the shelves are so
beautiful and we'll start importing them

472
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:11,380
and we wanted to put them on dangerous
list as I'm thinking as an alternative,

473
00:29:11,931 --> 00:29:15,650
we could maybe start farming
them, flip the shelves. Yeah,

474
00:29:16,870 --> 00:29:20,710
sure. Is often seen as a, as a solution
if we want more of something, but the,

475
00:29:20,711 --> 00:29:24,820
the wild harvest isn't available.
Can we make them ourselves?

476
00:29:25,090 --> 00:29:29,440
Nautilus are really interesting group
in that regard and interesting species

477
00:29:29,441 --> 00:29:33,610
because they've only just
successfully been bread at all.

478
00:29:33,611 --> 00:29:38,230
Like although people have been keeping
the animals in aquariums for a long time,

479
00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:43,000
they haven't been successfully breeding
and laying eggs and just in the last

480
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,790
year or two at the Monterey Bay aquarium
and they'd been keeping them and

481
00:29:45,791 --> 00:29:49,360
they've actually laid the eggs and
the eggs have actually hatched,

482
00:29:49,361 --> 00:29:52,720
which are two separate challenges
that both had to be overcome.

483
00:29:53,270 --> 00:29:58,270
But there's still a huge gap in having
hatchlings and having those grew up to be

484
00:29:59,561 --> 00:30:03,190
breeding adults. So I
think it's possible. Um, I,

485
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:06,820
I hope that it happens
because for many reasons.

486
00:30:06,821 --> 00:30:09,550
One is that I think it would just
be very interesting, but it's, uh,

487
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:14,580
it seems like they're very finicky species
and they're just very specific about

488
00:30:14,711 --> 00:30:16,480
the water requirements
and the food requirements.

489
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:19,780
And so I believe right now the acquire
the apiarists at the Monterey Bay

490
00:30:19,781 --> 00:30:22,420
aquarium are trying to figure
out what to feed the babies,

491
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:25,150
to get them to grow up healthy.
And it's,

492
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:28,600
it takes a long time because
even with good conditions,

493
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:33,450
it takes them up to 20 years to
reach maturity. So that's, you know,

494
00:30:33,490 --> 00:30:38,230
that's getting to be several aquarists
lifetimes of practice. Um, but, uh,

495
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:40,570
but I think, I think we'll get
there. I think it'll be very cool.

496
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:48,350
You said these creatures are
phoned in deep sea, right?

497
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:50,700
Many of them, yeah. Not all, but

498
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:54,500
meaning how deep and how
have they adapted to,

499
00:30:54,530 --> 00:30:57,230
because there's a lot of water
pressure, right? Like pretty deep.

500
00:30:58,730 --> 00:31:02,070
Yeah. It's a great question.
Are you more interested in the,

501
00:31:02,071 --> 00:31:05,270
the living ones are the extinct
ones are bald. Okay. Yeah,

502
00:31:05,510 --> 00:31:08,030
so it's a great question. The, um,

503
00:31:08,090 --> 00:31:13,090
the forms that have buoyant shells are
of course always somewhat limited because

504
00:31:13,581 --> 00:31:17,690
they have gas in their shell. And so if
they go too deep, that can implode. Uh,

505
00:31:17,691 --> 00:31:21,500
so even modern nautilus
is and modern cuddle fish,

506
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:26,150
which have an internal shell that still
has gas chambers in our limited by depth.

507
00:31:26,151 --> 00:31:30,410
So cuddle fish because they're,
their internal shell has quite weak walls.

508
00:31:30,590 --> 00:31:34,740
They can't go much deeper than
one or maybe 200 feet. Uh,

509
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:37,200
they're quite shallow
because of that. Well, yeah,

510
00:31:37,201 --> 00:31:40,040
shallow for an open ocean and all that.
For us,

511
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:42,080
a nautilus can do a little bit deeper.

512
00:31:42,081 --> 00:31:46,650
They can get to about 800 feet
for the most ones. And that's,

513
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:51,500
that's because the show is
much, much thicker. Uh, and the,

514
00:31:53,390 --> 00:31:57,440
the limits of the extinct ones
are of course hard to calculate.

515
00:31:57,441 --> 00:32:02,441
And it's always a little bit tricky to
know where they lived because the shells

516
00:32:02,901 --> 00:32:06,590
sometimes move around before being
a fossilized. And so if there,

517
00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:11,330
if the fossilized shells are found in
sediment that shows that it was in the

518
00:32:11,331 --> 00:32:12,140
deep sea,

519
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:14,510
well doesn't mean that the animal lived
in the deep sea or does it mean the

520
00:32:14,511 --> 00:32:16,730
animal lived above the
deep sea? Um, but they,

521
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:20,970
they're thought many of them especially,
let me see if I can go back here. Um,

522
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:23,240
it was,
this is an interesting,

523
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:26,520
where am I am annoyed is there,
uh,

524
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:31,310
these guys in particular, many
of these ammonites had, sorry,

525
00:32:31,311 --> 00:32:34,480
I probably wasn't supposed
to touch that. Um, uh,

526
00:32:34,490 --> 00:32:37,490
had these really complicated
walls between the chambers.

527
00:32:37,491 --> 00:32:40,520
So all of the squiggles
that you here are like,

528
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:45,580
if each chamber chambers wall between
the Digita was made of sort of tissue

529
00:32:45,831 --> 00:32:50,510
paper and you just scrambled it up and
it's still sealed between the chambers

530
00:32:50,511 --> 00:32:54,950
and held the gas from place to place.
But it had this incredibly complex,

531
00:32:55,250 --> 00:32:59,780
uh, line and it's thought that that
might have sort of somehow spread out the

532
00:32:59,781 --> 00:33:04,670
pressure and allowed them to go
even deeper. Um, and so there,

533
00:33:04,671 --> 00:33:07,340
there's some paleontologist actually
working right now and kind of

534
00:33:07,341 --> 00:33:11,420
reconstructing these as
models and figuring out what
pressure they might've been

535
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:12,740
been able to survive that.

536
00:33:15,790 --> 00:33:16,623
Yeah.

537
00:33:18,590 --> 00:33:20,360
Um, I don't think, let's see.

538
00:33:20,361 --> 00:33:24,020
I don't think any of them have been
estimated to live deeper than about a

539
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:24,290
thousand feet.

540
00:33:24,290 --> 00:33:28,880
So I don't think any of the shelled
cephalopods could have lived in what we

541
00:33:28,881 --> 00:33:32,100
think of as the real abyssal deep sea.
Um,

542
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:35,960
what this the first cephalopods
to colonize that area.

543
00:33:35,961 --> 00:33:38,810
It would have been the ones that
lost the shell. And in fact,

544
00:33:38,811 --> 00:33:43,811
it's thought that the ancestors of squid
who had evolved away from having a,

545
00:33:44,090 --> 00:33:48,320
an external shell and even even their
internal shell doesn't have gas chambers

546
00:33:48,321 --> 00:33:50,640
anymore.
It's just like this sort of thin,

547
00:33:50,641 --> 00:33:52,910
stiff rod that gives them
a little bit of structure.

548
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,090
So there they are basically
insensitive to pressure because they're

549
00:33:56,091 --> 00:33:59,450
incompressible, they're just, there's
no gas spaces, there's no gas bladder,

550
00:33:59,451 --> 00:34:00,140
there's nothing.

551
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:03,080
And so it's thought that one of the
reasons they might have survived the end

552
00:34:03,081 --> 00:34:07,670
cretaceous impact is that they had a
refuge in the deep sea where things didn't

553
00:34:07,671 --> 00:34:08,680
change so much.
And there,

554
00:34:08,681 --> 00:34:11,420
there are still many squid living
in the very deep seat today.

555
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:20,910
Speaking of Squid, um, I'm an octopus
person but also loved the Humboldt Squid.

556
00:34:21,250 --> 00:34:21,540
Uh,

557
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:26,540
I was wondering what drew you to that for
your phd and can you talk a little bit

558
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:30,310
about that? I would be happy to.
It's a lovely question. So, uh,

559
00:34:30,311 --> 00:34:34,830
the Humboldt squid was the subject of
my phd and it was somewhat accidental

560
00:34:34,831 --> 00:34:39,831
because I went into looking for graduate
programs and Phd advisors just being

561
00:34:41,431 --> 00:34:44,060
kind of a huge cephalopod in that. And I
was like, oh, we're kind of anything like,

562
00:34:44,070 --> 00:34:47,640
are you doing bobtail squid? Are you
doing pygmy octopuses, whatever it is. Um,

563
00:34:47,730 --> 00:34:52,730
and in Monterrey there's a marine
station that is affiliated with Stanford

564
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:54,510
University.
Some of you may already know this,

565
00:34:54,511 --> 00:34:57,030
it's right next to the Monterey Bay
aquarium and it's called Hopkins Marine

566
00:34:57,031 --> 00:35:01,860
station. And there's a squid lab there.
And the, the scientist who runs that lab,

567
00:35:01,861 --> 00:35:06,450
Bill Gilly was starting up
a whole research program
on Humboldt squid at about

568
00:35:06,451 --> 00:35:09,420
the same time that I was applying
to graduate school. And so I'm,

569
00:35:09,421 --> 00:35:10,640
so I met with him and we,

570
00:35:10,641 --> 00:35:13,140
he talked to me a bit about the squid
and it's like I have never heard of these

571
00:35:13,141 --> 00:35:17,400
guys before but they sound
really cool. And it was also, um,

572
00:35:17,430 --> 00:35:19,770
they were just starting
to expand their range.

573
00:35:19,830 --> 00:35:24,210
So it was a really interesting time to
be working on them that it was a large,

574
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:26,490
it's a large species.
They still is very large species.

575
00:35:26,491 --> 00:35:28,260
The adults can get about as big as me.

576
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:32,280
And it's also the biggest squid
fishery in the whole world.

577
00:35:32,281 --> 00:35:36,400
So of all of the different
species of squid that people
eat, little Calamari, um,

578
00:35:36,510 --> 00:35:39,660
these big stakes that are
on Humboldt squid are there.

579
00:35:39,661 --> 00:35:44,520
It's fished by the million tons a year
and most of that is in South America,

580
00:35:44,521 --> 00:35:48,390
Central America and Mexico.
But in the early two thousands,

581
00:35:48,391 --> 00:35:53,391
we were starting to find them on the
California coast and even up into Alaska.

582
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,590
They are getting really far north.

583
00:35:55,591 --> 00:35:59,130
And so it was a really fun time to be a
scientist studying them because we would

584
00:35:59,131 --> 00:36:02,990
get calls from people just
like it's fishermen. We,

585
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:07,200
we caught a huge squeeze it a giant squid,
what is it? Why are and can you eat it?

586
00:36:07,201 --> 00:36:11,400
Can I sell it? What can I do with it?
Um, and so, um, so it was, it was just,

587
00:36:11,401 --> 00:36:14,310
it was a really neat time and we were
trying to figure out why they were there,

588
00:36:14,311 --> 00:36:14,911
what they were doing.

589
00:36:14,911 --> 00:36:19,560
I ended up working a lot with the babies
and reproduction and my main question

590
00:36:19,561 --> 00:36:20,400
there was thinking,
okay,

591
00:36:20,401 --> 00:36:23,730
we know that there are adults
coming up north into California,

592
00:36:23,731 --> 00:36:26,280
which is very cold water for them.
They're used to the,

593
00:36:26,310 --> 00:36:30,510
the warmer water in the Gulf
of California. So okay, can
they have babies up here?

594
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:30,901
Basically,

595
00:36:30,901 --> 00:36:35,790
are we going to get a reproducing
population establishing
itself as the range is

596
00:36:35,791 --> 00:36:36,624
expanding.

597
00:36:37,050 --> 00:36:41,160
And it's an interestingly at the same
time as I was figuring out that the little

598
00:36:41,161 --> 00:36:44,040
babies needed warm water and
they were actually very finicky.

599
00:36:44,070 --> 00:36:46,980
They're teeny this hilarious thing.
So that you have grown up as big as me.

600
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:50,730
And when they're babies hatch though
like a grain of rice and they're quite

601
00:36:50,731 --> 00:36:53,850
finicky and they need warm water and
they need very special food and it's,

602
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,680
it's kind of the Nautilus problem.

603
00:36:55,681 --> 00:36:58,980
Even we couldn't feed them anything and
we would give them everything we would

604
00:36:58,981 --> 00:37:01,700
think of and they would just starve
in the lab. And now, all right,

605
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,360
we'll go back to the ocean, find
whatever you were meant to find. Um, and,

606
00:37:05,361 --> 00:37:09,750
and it seems interesting that while
I was finding that they had this very

607
00:37:09,751 --> 00:37:11,940
particular need as babies,

608
00:37:12,270 --> 00:37:17,270
the invasion as everyone is calling it
of California just kind of slowed down.

609
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:22,401
And eventually now fishermen
off California and further
north hardly ever find

610
00:37:22,441 --> 00:37:23,274
Humboldt squid.

611
00:37:23,370 --> 00:37:27,480
They're pretty much all retreated
back to their native range in Mexico.

612
00:37:27,481 --> 00:37:31,250
And even there they've gotten
a lot smaller. So it's, it's,

613
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:36,280
it's been fun to see in practice the
sort of flexibility that I talked about

614
00:37:36,301 --> 00:37:38,820
because the species as a whole
is still doing really well.

615
00:37:39,030 --> 00:37:43,580
But you can see them responding year
by year and even season by season two,

616
00:37:43,581 --> 00:37:44,910
the way the ocean changes.

617
00:37:45,550 --> 00:37:49,610
That's very cool.
All right,

618
00:37:49,650 --> 00:37:53,970
thanks for the awesome talk.
So this is a strange question,

619
00:37:53,971 --> 00:37:57,120
but given the absence of
preserve south buddy features,

620
00:37:57,180 --> 00:37:59,910
how do we know that extinct
cephalopods even add denticles

621
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:04,620
that's a great question. Um, how do we
even know that they had tentacles? Ah,

622
00:38:04,621 --> 00:38:08,340
I'm going to go to the
short answer is we don't,

623
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:12,780
maybe they didn't have tentacles at all.
And in particular,

624
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:16,650
sorry, these guys,
these really early ones.

625
00:38:17,170 --> 00:38:18,690
I think that in a way,

626
00:38:18,691 --> 00:38:21,870
the only reason people draw them with
tentacles is to show that we know they're

627
00:38:21,871 --> 00:38:25,040
cephalopods because that's
the defining feature. Um,

628
00:38:25,230 --> 00:38:26,820
but they might not have
had 10 nickels at all.

629
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:31,130
Interestingly by this point here,
which is the,

630
00:38:31,170 --> 00:38:34,620
the branching point where you get
the lineage of the Nautilus is,

631
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:36,880
and then the lineage going to
all your modern cephalopods.

632
00:38:37,030 --> 00:38:42,010
We're pretty sure that they would have
had tentacles by then because tentacles,

633
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:45,060
the f and the tentacles
come from the foot. So the,

634
00:38:45,090 --> 00:38:48,820
the ancestral cephalopod was related
to a snail which has a big foot that it

635
00:38:48,821 --> 00:38:49,720
uses around on.

636
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:53,350
And so we know because of studying the
way they develop in the egg that what

637
00:38:53,351 --> 00:38:56,890
happens is that foot splits into
tentacles quite early on in development.

638
00:38:57,130 --> 00:39:02,130
And that happens in embryonic nautilus
and in embryonic squid at the same time

639
00:39:04,150 --> 00:39:08,050
and with the same number.
So it's always 10 to begin with.

640
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:12,010
Even with a novelists that eventually
gets up to 60 or 90 tentacles.

641
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:15,610
And because that trait
seems to be so conserved,

642
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:19,760
it's thought that it probably goes
way back to this split that there's an

643
00:39:19,761 --> 00:39:24,420
incestual cephalopod trait of having
a foot that divides into 10 tentacles.

644
00:39:24,670 --> 00:39:29,560
And then that evolved in Nautilus is
at some point to be just the slight

645
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:33,580
plethora of tentacles. And
in squid two of those, those,

646
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:36,760
the and the were all equals equal
length as well because you do get a few

647
00:39:36,761 --> 00:39:41,200
fossils up over here that have
these 10 equal link pinnacles.

648
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:44,920
And so two of them in squid
became much longer and elastic,

649
00:39:45,130 --> 00:39:48,550
two of them in octopus has disappeared.
But even an octopus is,

650
00:39:48,551 --> 00:39:52,420
we know that the ancestral characteristic
was to have 10. Uh, and so that's,

651
00:39:52,510 --> 00:39:55,810
that's sort of the answers were pretty
sure that by here they had tentacles and

652
00:39:55,811 --> 00:39:59,800
some point in here it probably evolved.
It would have been useful.

653
00:39:59,801 --> 00:40:02,470
If you think about being
a snail up in the water,

654
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:06,700
how do you get your food then maybe
you just have a really flexible foot.

655
00:40:08,590 --> 00:40:13,400
Just one question. Um, thank
you for the music talk, um,

656
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:17,220
question about chromatophores and when
they evolved and if there is a way to

657
00:40:17,221 --> 00:40:21,090
tell when they evolved. And then a
second part of the question there, Raja,

658
00:40:21,270 --> 00:40:23,100
is that just a mollusk trait?

659
00:40:23,101 --> 00:40:25,770
And that's how they know that that's what
the tongue looked like when they were

660
00:40:25,771 --> 00:40:28,830
going back and creating
imagery or how do they tell?

661
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:31,750
Right? So two different
traits. The chromatophores,

662
00:40:31,751 --> 00:40:36,160
the color changing ability and the the
gradular. Um, so I'll take the bride,

663
00:40:36,161 --> 00:40:36,791
you'll have first,

664
00:40:36,791 --> 00:40:41,310
since there's more physical evidence for
it and the ratchet is a moleskin traits.

665
00:40:41,311 --> 00:40:44,470
So you'll see Rachel is in
snails, even in clams, um,

666
00:40:44,471 --> 00:40:46,990
all kinds of different mollusks.
And in fact,

667
00:40:47,050 --> 00:40:51,830
all of the different snail ratchet
[inaudible] are useful because snails,

668
00:40:51,850 --> 00:40:54,790
snails eat and a lot of different ways.
And I don't mean just um,

669
00:40:54,850 --> 00:40:56,080
Darden snails at this point.

670
00:40:56,081 --> 00:41:00,130
There are a lot of marine snails and
their marine snails that scrape food off

671
00:41:00,131 --> 00:41:00,461
rocks.

672
00:41:00,461 --> 00:41:03,100
And there were marines sales that are
predators that eat other fish in their

673
00:41:03,101 --> 00:41:06,190
marine snails that float actually float
through the water and catch plankton.

674
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:11,400
And so looking at all of those different
Ragland's is the main way that the

675
00:41:11,441 --> 00:41:16,340
paleontologist who begin to
look at ammonite fragilize
cephalopod is kind of say,

676
00:41:16,341 --> 00:41:18,050
okay,
what would it have been good for it?

677
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:21,700
Does it look more like the snail that
he's plankton or the snail that eats LG or

678
00:41:21,970 --> 00:41:24,430
these things? And so the, um,

679
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:29,350
the ratchet itself is usually
not preserved independently
as a fossil because

680
00:41:29,351 --> 00:41:32,140
it's quite delicate and it probably
just falls apart. And so I,

681
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:34,090
if am remembering right,

682
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:39,240
the only real radicals that are found
are when they're inside a shell.

683
00:41:40,450 --> 00:41:43,750
And so either the shell has to be
physically broken and then it's,

684
00:41:43,780 --> 00:41:46,990
it's sort of just luck
whether you actually find
the regular or whether you've

685
00:41:46,991 --> 00:41:51,160
destroyed it by breaking the shell or
you see it by doing essentially like an

686
00:41:51,161 --> 00:41:53,200
electronic dissection with a CT scan.

687
00:41:54,030 --> 00:41:54,780
MMM.

688
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:57,480
And then for the chromatophore far as,
that's a very good question.

689
00:41:57,481 --> 00:42:02,481
We think that probably that amazing skin
and amazing color changing skin evolved

690
00:42:03,090 --> 00:42:06,600
around the same time that the shell shell,
Shell,

691
00:42:06,601 --> 00:42:11,370
Shell went internal, which is in this
lineage called the Polaroids. And, um,

692
00:42:11,550 --> 00:42:14,700
this is one of these fun facts that I
only learned when I started researching my

693
00:42:14,701 --> 00:42:17,880
book. I, a phd did not
teach me this, but, um,

694
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:21,060
when you're doing all this sedimological
research because people ask you

695
00:42:21,061 --> 00:42:22,980
questions coldly,
oid means scabbard.

696
00:42:23,250 --> 00:42:27,480
So this whole group is named because
their bodies became like the scabbards for

697
00:42:27,481 --> 00:42:30,750
their shell. It was internalized
and cover it up. Uh,

698
00:42:30,751 --> 00:42:35,370
and so once the shell goes internal,
which is this little light colored thing,

699
00:42:35,670 --> 00:42:38,430
it's still chambered.
It's still buoyant.

700
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:40,740
It was still quite
substantial for a long time,

701
00:42:41,010 --> 00:42:43,650
but it was no longer
something you could hide in.

702
00:42:44,370 --> 00:42:49,290
And so at that point it would have been
extremely advantageous for the skin to

703
00:42:49,410 --> 00:42:51,570
develop some method of protection.

704
00:42:51,810 --> 00:42:55,800
And so we think that that's probably
when both camouflage and ink sacs are

705
00:42:55,801 --> 00:42:57,720
likely to have evolved.
But there's,

706
00:42:57,810 --> 00:43:00,290
there's precious little in the
fossil record about either one.

707
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:08,350
So put it on my like three
third grader hat here.

708
00:43:08,370 --> 00:43:10,840
Do we call them tentacles
because there are 10 of them.

709
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:14,940
Oh, that's such a good
question. Um, it is, ah,

710
00:43:15,250 --> 00:43:17,100
it is technically,
yeah,

711
00:43:18,430 --> 00:43:21,220
wrong to call them all tend to go

712
00:43:22,730 --> 00:43:25,230
kind of gentler word for take
it again, it's, it's wrong. Um,

713
00:43:25,390 --> 00:43:27,550
they're all arms really.

714
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:32,760
And the word tentacles is best to reserve
for those two really elastic ones.

715
00:43:33,660 --> 00:43:35,410
Uh,
so a squid or a cuddle fish,

716
00:43:35,620 --> 00:43:39,520
if you've ever maybe seen a video of
them catching prey or you can go home and

717
00:43:39,521 --> 00:43:43,240
look one up, um, they have their arms
that are just always the same length.

718
00:43:43,241 --> 00:43:45,670
Then maybe they might grab slow moving,
pray with it,

719
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:48,610
but if they need to catch a fish
or something that's really fast,

720
00:43:48,611 --> 00:43:52,060
they have these elastic tentacles that
go shoot and catch it and bring it back

721
00:43:52,061 --> 00:43:56,350
in. It's like milliseconds. It's a really,
really fast and those are the tentacles.

722
00:43:56,470 --> 00:44:00,580
So squid have them cuddle fish have
them occupy says do not have them. Um,

723
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:04,480
so technically squid and cuddle fish are
the only ones with true tentacles and,

724
00:44:04,481 --> 00:44:07,450
but you can remember them
not because of the 10 part,

725
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:12,600
but because the word tentacle is longer
than the word arm and tentacles are

726
00:44:12,821 --> 00:44:13,960
longer than arms.

727
00:44:17,770 --> 00:44:19,940
I have one more if it's okay.
Um,

728
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:22,620
so since the seas are acidifying,

729
00:44:22,630 --> 00:44:24,420
I had a question about the
shells because you're saying

730
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:27,560
the, the bitty squids and
octopuses are having a problem.

731
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:31,830
Are they a calcium carbonate shell or
they silica based and their calcium

732
00:44:31,831 --> 00:44:36,630
carbonate. Okay. Um, all the, even the
cuddle bone, which is the internal Shell,

733
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:37,440
um,

734
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:42,440
and the squid for the most
part is not even calcified.

735
00:44:42,630 --> 00:44:46,530
So that's one of the reasons that squid
seem to be a bit more resilient to ocean

736
00:44:46,531 --> 00:44:49,990
acidification is they don't have very
much that's actually calcified. Um,

737
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:54,570
but the Nautilus Shell and the cuttlefish
shell are our calcium. Interestingly,

738
00:44:54,630 --> 00:44:59,010
there is one other place that all of
the cephalopods have a bit of calcium

739
00:44:59,011 --> 00:45:03,240
carbonate that's very
sensitive to acidification and
it's these little bones in

740
00:45:03,241 --> 00:45:03,931
their ears,

741
00:45:03,931 --> 00:45:08,010
teeny little bones called satellites
that help them tell up from down.

742
00:45:08,220 --> 00:45:12,180
We actually have similar little teeny
tiny bones in our ears that rock around

743
00:45:12,390 --> 00:45:14,940
and they're what make you sick
on merry go rounds. And how,

744
00:45:14,941 --> 00:45:18,810
you know when you're facing up and when
you're pointed down and the development

745
00:45:18,811 --> 00:45:22,800
of those teeny little bones in
cephalopods seems to be quite affected by

746
00:45:22,801 --> 00:45:23,940
acidified waters.

747
00:45:24,210 --> 00:45:29,210
And so there's some risk that we might
end up with ocean's full of sort of

748
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:31,920
disoriented,

749
00:45:31,950 --> 00:45:36,570
lost the squid that can't figure
out which way is up and down.

750
00:45:37,050 --> 00:45:39,810
Uh, we haven't gotten there yet
though, so I think it was crest.

751
00:45:41,900 --> 00:45:45,320
Oh, thank you Deanna. Thank you everyone
for coming. Let's keep him around a plot.
