1
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:11,220
[inaudible].

2
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:16,950
Thank you very much and thanks
for coming and thanks for hosting.

3
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:21,720
Um, I'd like to tell you
about, uh, well this book,

4
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:26,640
it's a been a long journey
and it's a little unusual.

5
00:00:26,641 --> 00:00:31,160
So I thought I'd tell you a bit
about, you know, how I came to, uh,

6
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:34,710
make the book and why and then
a little bit about the content.

7
00:00:34,711 --> 00:00:36,500
But I'm going to save,
uh,

8
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:41,560
hopefully most of the time just to chat
with you if you would like to about, uh,

9
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:44,130
uh,
the book,

10
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:47,760
whether it be how it's
made or what's in it.

11
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:53,400
So let me tell you a festival, a
little bit about the mission. So, uh,

12
00:00:53,401 --> 00:00:55,790
among the things I do besides,
uh,

13
00:00:55,830 --> 00:01:00,530
research in areas of a theoretical
physicists, physics, uh,

14
00:01:00,531 --> 00:01:03,430
and of course teaching the
usual Professor Gig, uh, is, uh,

15
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,960
I also like to be out there in the
world trying to get people excited about

16
00:01:06,961 --> 00:01:07,441
science,

17
00:01:07,441 --> 00:01:12,441
trying to share the excitement about
science and trying to do what I think is

18
00:01:13,411 --> 00:01:17,160
very important, which is to increase
people's comfort with science.

19
00:01:17,161 --> 00:01:20,430
Let it be really part of
everyday conversation.

20
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:25,260
Like any other aspect of,
of our culture. So, uh,

21
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:27,670
in that regard,
uh,

22
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:33,410
I think that we should do a better job
of embedding science in many aspects of

23
00:01:35,731 --> 00:01:36,421
our lives.

24
00:01:36,421 --> 00:01:40,320
And one of the things that this book
is trying to do is to encourage that in

25
00:01:40,321 --> 00:01:42,720
various ways, as you'll see. So anyway,

26
00:01:42,721 --> 00:01:47,160
that's meant to be sort of everyday people
out there in the world and you'll see

27
00:01:47,161 --> 00:01:51,360
how it fits in later on. But let's
take a step back to the core idea.

28
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:57,890
And this goes back actually
many years, uh, to the,

29
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,660
uh, the sorts of questions
that people would ask me, Oh,

30
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:04,910
almost 20 years ago about,
uh,

31
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:07,570
when I'm going to write that book.
And,

32
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:11,270
and what people usually mean by that is
that an academic who's out there in the

33
00:02:11,271 --> 00:02:12,980
world talking about their fields,

34
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:17,270
usually at some point writes a book and
it's a book of a certain sort. And, uh,

35
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:19,380
it's, um, it sort of,

36
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,560
uh,
um,

37
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:28,640
an ancient tradition and in, in,
in, in, in certain ways. And, uh,

38
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:32,360
I didn't actually feel any
urgency to write such a book.

39
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:33,580
And one of the reasons is,

40
00:02:33,581 --> 00:02:37,910
is that I didn't feel we were necessarily
reaching new people with the kind of

41
00:02:37,911 --> 00:02:41,660
book that we write. Um, uh,
those books are wonderful.

42
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:46,190
They do a very important service and I'll
probably end up writing some one day,

43
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:50,360
but at that time I didn't feel that the
world really needed another one from me.

44
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:53,660
And, um, I, uh,

45
00:02:53,661 --> 00:02:57,050
I was also distracted by very exciting
things going on in research at the time.

46
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:02,410
Um, but the core idea that came to me was
that there was a kind of book out there

47
00:03:02,411 --> 00:03:04,300
that actually I hadn't seen.

48
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:07,030
And so that got me interested
in maybe trying to do that.

49
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,940
And it's a sort of book
that you might, uh, um, uh,

50
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:12,943
uh,

51
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:18,220
read and feel more invited to be part
of the conversation about science.

52
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:21,090
And so the idea of
conversations about science, uh,

53
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:25,750
became sort of first and foremost in
my mind how to really celebrate those

54
00:03:25,751 --> 00:03:28,810
conversations that I really know
are going on in the world out there.

55
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:31,600
And that I really think that
everyone should feel free to have.

56
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:36,070
And so a book entirely about
conversations, uh, was what came to be.

57
00:03:36,071 --> 00:03:39,760
And then they realized it was
very much in the tradition of, um,

58
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:45,070
the dialogues of Plato. And also
you may know very famously of, of,

59
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:50,050
of Galileo, a lot of Galileo's
most famous ideas, uh,

60
00:03:50,051 --> 00:03:55,051
that we know him for actually were first
communicated in the form of a book in

61
00:03:56,771 --> 00:04:01,120
dialog form those where in some ways
the popular books of the day for those,

62
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:05,830
for those who, uh, um, who
read about such discussions.

63
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:09,150
And uh, so, so, so I have on screen, um,

64
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:13,520
a little screenshot of
a dialogues, uh, uh,

65
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:16,450
Galileo and also, uh,
the platonic dialogues,

66
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:19,570
Socratic dialogues I
should say of a Plato.

67
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:24,810
And so that was sort of the idea, but
it was still very much a prose book. Um,

68
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:26,740
but it was at least a step along the way.

69
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:33,610
The next thing I thought
it'd be interesting is to
also show what happens when

70
00:04:33,611 --> 00:04:35,560
you have conversations.

71
00:04:35,561 --> 00:04:39,610
You get sort of animated
into a conversation about
some aspect of science and

72
00:04:39,611 --> 00:04:42,790
maybe you scribble and doodle a little
bit and those scribblings and doodles got

73
00:04:42,791 --> 00:04:44,290
actually can be kind of interesting.

74
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,860
And I thought it'd be fun to sort of
show some of those scribbles and doodles

75
00:04:47,861 --> 00:04:50,290
and a book. So it was sort of
still a prose book in my mind,

76
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:51,820
but with some illustrations showing,

77
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:54,730
showing a little bit of that
because that can be interesting.

78
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:59,750
And then as time went by, sort of
years went by, had shelved the idea,

79
00:04:59,751 --> 00:05:01,030
I came back to it and then I thought,
oh,

80
00:05:01,031 --> 00:05:04,390
wouldn't it be interesting to see
the people having the conversation?

81
00:05:04,391 --> 00:05:08,440
That would be unusual. And
maybe that would be a way
of drawing you in some more.

82
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:09,880
You're wondering who these people are,

83
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:12,730
how did they come to meet
and so on and so forth.

84
00:05:12,731 --> 00:05:17,200
So that seems like an interesting device
that could take the book further in a

85
00:05:17,201 --> 00:05:22,180
direction that, uh, maybe reaches new
kinds of people. And I thought, well,

86
00:05:22,181 --> 00:05:27,160
it would be nice to show where these
people are having those conversations.

87
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:32,020
And that would be great because science,
which still unfortunately has this,

88
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:34,030
this image of being,
uh,

89
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:38,590
the sort of specialized topic done
by special people in special places,

90
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:39,761
uh,
you know,

91
00:05:39,761 --> 00:05:43,030
seminar rooms and labs and things where
it'd be nice to show that science is

92
00:05:43,031 --> 00:05:47,110
happening. Conversations between ordinary
people out there in the, in the world.

93
00:05:47,111 --> 00:05:52,111
So places these conversations in cafes
out there in the world and on trains

94
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:57,380
where people are, where people meet.
And so that was what I started,

95
00:05:57,381 --> 00:06:01,520
uh, uh, imagining to do. And these
are some snapshots from what,

96
00:06:01,521 --> 00:06:04,580
what eventually became the book.
Uh,

97
00:06:04,581 --> 00:06:07,820
and then I got a bit carried away and,
uh,

98
00:06:07,890 --> 00:06:10,550
a little bit perhaps detailed,
obsessed,

99
00:06:10,551 --> 00:06:15,551
but it was very much the idea of trying
to place the conversations about science

100
00:06:16,401 --> 00:06:18,980
between ordinary people out
there in ordinary places.

101
00:06:18,981 --> 00:06:22,430
Some of you may or may not recognize
that's a, that's a real, uh,

102
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:26,480
location and, uh, it's, you know,

103
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:31,470
really trying to get that
idea across. So anyway, I, uh,

104
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:34,640
spent a fair amount of time
making the book and, uh,

105
00:06:34,641 --> 00:06:36,440
I'll tell you a bit more
about that in a moment.

106
00:06:36,441 --> 00:06:40,610
But let's first talk about
what you actually see when
you, when you, when you, uh,

107
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,390
when you,

108
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:45,080
when you open the book and indeed
you'll see conversations and it will be

109
00:06:45,081 --> 00:06:45,920
between people,

110
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:50,540
various pairs of people and uh,

111
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:54,890
what's going on is that they're
having conversations about, uh,

112
00:06:54,891 --> 00:06:58,910
ideas about our universe.
Uh, I'm writing what I know,

113
00:06:58,911 --> 00:07:03,520
so I'm mostly in this, uh, incidents
are mostly talking about, um,

114
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:08,480
aspects of how our universe works. Uh,
from the point of view of physics. Uh,

115
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:13,040
in various ways. It isn't all
abstract, esoteric conversations about,

116
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:18,110
you know, black holes and the
big bang and what have you.

117
00:07:18,111 --> 00:07:20,780
There's a lot of everyday science in
there as well because they think these

118
00:07:20,781 --> 00:07:21,710
things are all connected.

119
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:25,460
One of the other great things about
having it in conversation form is that you

120
00:07:25,461 --> 00:07:30,461
can show that connectivity conversations
aren't ever really just about one

121
00:07:30,891 --> 00:07:32,600
topic,
a real conversation.

122
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:36,100
They tend to wander a little bit
and go off and sort of interesting a

123
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:37,400
serendipitous directions.

124
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:42,080
So using that and trying to represent
that and conversation allows me to show

125
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:45,350
that, uh, lots of science
topics are interconnected,

126
00:07:45,351 --> 00:07:48,530
which is another nice thing
to be able to get across.

127
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:53,360
So there's conversations in cafes,
on trains between various kinds of people.

128
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:56,650
Some are scientists and we're
not scientists. And, um,

129
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:59,440
one of the fun things I also get to do is,
is,

130
00:07:59,441 --> 00:08:03,770
is to break another major rule about how
the science books as supposed to work,

131
00:08:03,771 --> 00:08:07,340
which is that I can show equations
and I can talk about equations.

132
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:08,751
And if you like,

133
00:08:08,751 --> 00:08:12,980
you can treat the equations as part of
the art that's decorating a, the book,

134
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:16,240
um, or you can look a little
bit closer and, and, and,

135
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:19,970
and try and connect what's going on in
the equations to what's going on in the

136
00:08:19,971 --> 00:08:23,870
conversation. And there are some of
the conversations that actually, uh,

137
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:26,750
don't shy away from saying, no, let's
look at these equations. It's okay.

138
00:08:26,751 --> 00:08:30,080
Don't run screaming. Um, uh, you know,

139
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:34,460
you're an audience so it wouldn't run
screaming. But unfortunately, we have, uh,

140
00:08:34,461 --> 00:08:38,510
this view in society that somehow
mathematics is this scary thing.

141
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:43,840
And, uh, you're advised as a, as a, as
a, as author of popular level books,

142
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:46,220
not to put equations and your
books because it'll, it'll,

143
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:49,200
it'll scare your audience
away. Every equation, uh,

144
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:53,520
supposedly half of the audience or
something like that. It has been said. Um,

145
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:55,490
I think that's ridiculous.
Uh,

146
00:08:55,880 --> 00:09:00,360
mathematics is one of the
major tools of how we, uh,

147
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:05,190
arrive at ideas, uh, manipulate
ideas and, um, and uh,

148
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:08,970
have a dialogue with nature.
And why would you leave that out in any,

149
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,800
in any discussion, um, uh, in depth
about how science has done so.

150
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:15,360
So,
so I have that,

151
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:19,110
I have that there and actually have a
discussion between these two characters

152
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:22,470
where, where, uh, one of them
is actually saying, no, no, no.

153
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:27,480
Treat it like you treat, uh,
going into an art gallery, right?

154
00:09:27,481 --> 00:09:29,910
You don't know everything
about how paintings are done,

155
00:09:29,911 --> 00:09:32,880
but you can get something out of it. You
won't get everything, but that's okay.

156
00:09:32,881 --> 00:09:35,640
You'll, you'll look at the painting,
maybe you'll come back another day,

157
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,230
you'll look again,
you'll get something else,

158
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:40,050
treat equations on the page the same way.

159
00:09:40,051 --> 00:09:43,440
So that's sort of the idea is I'm
trying to change things and in terms of,

160
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:47,760
of what we do with a science books
about supposedly difficult topics.

161
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,650
Um,
and again,

162
00:09:49,651 --> 00:09:53,640
I should emphasize there's nothing wrong
with the existing kinds of books that

163
00:09:53,641 --> 00:09:58,080
are done, uh, that, uh, and that
should continue. It's, it's a,

164
00:09:58,081 --> 00:10:01,130
it's just that I think we
can do so much more and, and,

165
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,000
and engage so many more
people. So that's, uh,

166
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:09,240
one of the core ideas of doing, uh, uh,
what I'm doing. So here's some more,

167
00:10:09,241 --> 00:10:12,450
here's a more people in conversation
in various kinds of locations,

168
00:10:12,451 --> 00:10:17,130
different kinds of artistic styles and
so on and so forth. Um, all in all,

169
00:10:17,131 --> 00:10:21,240
what I can do is talk about
science on many different levels.

170
00:10:21,241 --> 00:10:25,710
That was one of the things that I
realized, uh, when I was, uh, uh,

171
00:10:25,711 --> 00:10:30,711
in the middle of doing the book after
I arrived at the idea that what I was

172
00:10:31,021 --> 00:10:34,330
really doing was a graphic
novel. And to be honest, uh, it,

173
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:37,980
it hadn't occurred to me that I was doing
a graphic novel until very late in the

174
00:10:37,981 --> 00:10:42,930
process until I really
had thought conversations,

175
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:47,520
um, show equations, show scribblings show
locations, and then it occurred to me,

176
00:10:47,521 --> 00:10:50,220
oh my goodness, I really, really
should be doing this as narrative art.

177
00:10:50,221 --> 00:10:53,730
This is a graphic novel if you
like the images had, had, had,

178
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:57,570
had eaten the pros and a and
taken over the whole book.

179
00:10:57,571 --> 00:10:59,730
And then in my mind it sort of clicked.
It's a graphic novel.

180
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:04,170
As soon as I realize that, then
I realized two things. One,

181
00:11:04,171 --> 00:11:07,960
no one had ever done this
before. And, uh, so I,

182
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,940
I really needed to do it to show
that it could be done. And second,

183
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:17,400
it allows you to do so many things in
terms of how you talk about the ideas.

184
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:22,860
Looking at the screen here, you can see
several sorts of things going on. I have,

185
00:11:22,861 --> 00:11:26,460
for example, uh, showing the
scribblings as I promised,

186
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:29,640
I'm actually showing some, you know, how,

187
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:33,070
how a theorist might write some equations
about a particular issue that's being

188
00:11:33,071 --> 00:11:37,710
discussed. So that's one thing I can talk
about. I can have the people talking, uh,

189
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:38,281
and you know,

190
00:11:38,281 --> 00:11:40,950
speech bubbles about them talking so
you can hear what they're talking.

191
00:11:40,951 --> 00:11:45,951
So that's one level I can go to a more
abstract level where I also show some of

192
00:11:46,021 --> 00:11:50,640
the tools, um, in, in more
abstract sense, uh, of, of a,

193
00:11:50,641 --> 00:11:53,870
of what's going on in physics,
for example. That, uh,

194
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:58,240
that diagram in the center is something a,
you may have heard of.

195
00:11:58,241 --> 00:11:59,500
It's called the Feynman diagram.

196
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:04,150
It's arguably one of the most powerful
tools ever invented to compute things

197
00:12:04,151 --> 00:12:08,470
that we confront with nature and test
with nature to incredible accuracy.

198
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:13,480
Um, um, and, uh, it's an amazing
tool and it's basically a cartoon.

199
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:16,630
That's what we actually use in physics.
It's a cartoon.

200
00:12:16,631 --> 00:12:20,350
It belongs in a book that also
using that language. And in fact,

201
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:23,540
I build panels around it
and show, and you can, you,

202
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:27,850
if you read it in the way you're
supposed to read a comic panels,

203
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:31,300
you'll also reconstruct the physics
that's going on, which is rather nice.

204
00:12:31,301 --> 00:12:35,110
So I can show that a level of abstraction,
but I can go further.

205
00:12:35,111 --> 00:12:38,920
I can also talk about another level of a,

206
00:12:38,921 --> 00:12:41,560
of what's going on with the
physics, uh, using this,

207
00:12:41,561 --> 00:12:43,750
this mode that I really
can't do in any other medium.

208
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:48,460
And I'll say a little bit about that
shortly. And then I can also, uh,

209
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:49,750
have the,
uh,

210
00:12:49,751 --> 00:12:53,530
the conversation lists either
with real or imagined objects,

211
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:55,300
engage with the physics as well.

212
00:12:55,301 --> 00:12:59,350
So that's another sort of visual level
that I can play with all on the same page.

213
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:03,010
So there's really no other medium
that can do this. And I, I feel this,

214
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:07,390
there's a lot of potential here for,
for doing so much more, uh, in this, uh,

215
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:11,620
in this space, uh, with this
mode of, uh, of communication.

216
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:17,290
And then I can also do
some, some, uh, some playful
things. For example, here's a,

217
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:21,880
a couple talking in a, in a, in
a, in a, in a square at a table,

218
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:26,830
and they're actually talking about the
physics of multiverses and black holes

219
00:13:26,831 --> 00:13:30,510
and so on and so forth. And
there's an idea of how, um, uh,

220
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:35,350
you have a branching structure
where, where, um, uh, universities,

221
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:39,880
uh, uh, in, in some theory separating from
each other and branching out and, and, uh,

222
00:13:39,881 --> 00:13:43,090
I'm actually without banging
it too much on the head,

223
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:47,050
you're viewing that you're viewing them
through the branches of an overhead tree.

224
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:49,960
And so there's again, a
resonance with the, with the, uh,

225
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:53,410
with the conversation in the, uh,
in the decoration if you like.

226
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,790
And then I can go really a sort
of off the reservation and,

227
00:13:56,791 --> 00:13:59,770
and also have sort of big metaphorical
discussions. They actually start,

228
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:04,960
this couple starts, um, having
a fanciful discussion, uh,

229
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:10,060
about some physics analogies
with, uh, with ideas and, um,

230
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:11,680
in, in, in paradise lost.

231
00:14:11,681 --> 00:14:15,610
And I can actually go crazy and actually
sort of draw bets and things like that

232
00:14:15,611 --> 00:14:20,440
as well. So, so you, you can really
play on many levels in the service of,

233
00:14:20,441 --> 00:14:25,370
of, of having fun, uh, with the
idea and really, um, still, uh,

234
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:29,290
have a serious discussion about
some important ideas in science.

235
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:34,810
So let me say a little bit about methods
because people are very curious about

236
00:14:34,811 --> 00:14:38,410
how you make these things and
how I went about making it. Um,

237
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:43,950
well, it all goes down to, uh,
figuring out whether I could draw a,

238
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:48,360
at the level needed to, uh, to
carry it, to carry this off. And,

239
00:14:48,361 --> 00:14:51,680
and the answer is that I, that I couldn't
at the beginning, I had to teach myself.

240
00:14:51,681 --> 00:14:52,790
And, uh, you know,

241
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:56,870
this as a side remark is a very
important thing to emphasize,

242
00:14:56,871 --> 00:15:00,710
which is that drawing, uh, like
many other things, uh, is, is,

243
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:05,050
is mostly a learned skill that you can
actually set out to learn and, and, uh,

244
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:07,020
and practice and do it.
It's,

245
00:15:07,021 --> 00:15:10,760
it's very little to do with the mythology
of natural talent and so on and so

246
00:15:10,761 --> 00:15:13,820
forth. So, um, I could, you know,

247
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:15,830
do a bit of drawing and
sketching like anyone else,

248
00:15:15,831 --> 00:15:20,230
but I really had to put in the time to
just practice and learn the skill set

249
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,490
needed and then study the actual,

250
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:27,410
a whole industry of how you make
graphic novels and um, and uh,

251
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:29,480
and try and learn those techniques.

252
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:35,070
But mostly there's just putting
in the time to draw. So, uh,

253
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:38,330
the caring sketch books
around with me and, uh, um,

254
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:41,960
just a drawing every time
I got the opportunity.

255
00:15:41,961 --> 00:15:45,200
Mostly trying to understand
the human body, the human face.

256
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:48,200
So trying to,
uh,

257
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:51,380
get as many opportunities as possible
and public transport is just great for

258
00:15:51,381 --> 00:15:52,290
that.
Um,

259
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:55,880
although it's getting a bit annoying now
because most people that are like this

260
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:58,390
because you know, phones, but, um,

261
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:02,690
maybe I'll do an entire book of the
tops of People's heads some point.

262
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:07,810
Um, but anyway, uh, so, so,
uh, you know, a lot of, uh,

263
00:16:07,811 --> 00:16:12,320
a lot of practicing, uh,
various kinds of, uh, uh,

264
00:16:12,321 --> 00:16:16,670
techniques, um, uh, uh, going into, uh,

265
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:21,590
life drawing studios and just,
uh, um, uh, practicing on,

266
00:16:21,591 --> 00:16:22,790
on the,
on,

267
00:16:23,810 --> 00:16:27,530
on the human body to learn
anatomy and practicing faces,

268
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:32,030
practicing digital techniques and,
uh, also traditional techniques,

269
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,700
drawing buildings,
drawing buildings out there in the world,

270
00:16:34,701 --> 00:16:38,330
as that's a lot of fun. I stumbled upon
the whole urban sketchers movement,

271
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:40,250
which is wonderful, by the way,
if you don't know about it,

272
00:16:40,251 --> 00:16:44,270
just Google urban sketchers and you'll
find there's a whole movement of people

273
00:16:44,271 --> 00:16:48,890
who just go out, that you actually,
sometimes around London for example,

274
00:16:48,891 --> 00:16:52,220
or any big city, you'll, you'll, you'll
see groups of people just sketching,

275
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:56,790
just sort of, they've just descended and
they're sketching and it's actually a,

276
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,690
it could well be one of the urban
sketchers meetups. And, uh, that's,

277
00:16:59,691 --> 00:17:03,000
that's actually a fun thing
to do. I never had the, uh,

278
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:08,270
never had the time or, or courage
to, uh, to, to join such a group.

279
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:11,790
I'm a bit more of a solitary
sketcher myself, but, um,

280
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:15,350
maybe I will one day cause it's a, it's
a great way of encouraging each other.

281
00:17:15,351 --> 00:17:17,180
I understand.
So anyway,

282
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:21,980
a lot of techniques
then, uh, I learned, uh,

283
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:25,820
particularly to do with make it going
from just doing sketches to, to,

284
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:28,570
to learning more graphic styles
that are appropriate for, for,

285
00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:32,060
for graphic novels and learning how to
deal with light and shade and things like

286
00:17:32,061 --> 00:17:36,560
that. And then, yes, a old
fashion techniques, which I love,

287
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:40,280
like doing a lot of perspective
construction by hand,

288
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:44,120
but then also learning how to
do perspective construction
on computer to speed

289
00:17:44,121 --> 00:17:47,360
things up and things
like that. Um, and uh,

290
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:52,200
and then traditional banking and digital
banking and so on and so forth. Uh,

291
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:55,560
moving forward, uh, here are
some examples of sort of,

292
00:17:58,250 --> 00:17:58,770
uh,

293
00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:03,770
before and after sketching out ideas
which eventually turned into final pages.

294
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:04,670
Um,

295
00:18:04,670 --> 00:18:08,910
the part of the process which people
sometimes find interesting in some cases I

296
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:13,110
wrote conversations and then designed
images to go with them and other cases I

297
00:18:13,111 --> 00:18:15,240
did, I designed images. Uh,

298
00:18:15,241 --> 00:18:18,300
at the same time as I was thinking about
what the conversation around them would

299
00:18:18,301 --> 00:18:23,040
be a dependent upon the nature of the
topic. And also where I was in the,

300
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:27,450
in the process I started
in around 2010, um, having,

301
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,840
having realized it should be
a graphic book pack in 2006,

302
00:18:30,841 --> 00:18:35,550
it took me a while to find the time.
And then I had a sabbatical in 2010.

303
00:18:35,551 --> 00:18:39,000
And so I started trying to see if I
could teach myself to draw at that higher

304
00:18:39,001 --> 00:18:43,230
level. Um, and then I was
drawing from 2010 until 2016.

305
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:47,910
I'm actually 2017. And,
uh, so, uh, styles change,

306
00:18:47,911 --> 00:18:52,860
techniques change, workflow, uh, methods
changed and so on and so forth. Um,

307
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:53,851
and uh,

308
00:18:53,851 --> 00:18:58,851
so these are just some examples of
a sketching turning into the final,

309
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:00,300
uh,
product.

310
00:19:01,910 --> 00:19:02,380
Okay.

311
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:03,370
And, uh, this is,

312
00:19:03,371 --> 00:19:08,371
this is a good example of a sketch that
was done at the same time as the ideas

313
00:19:09,130 --> 00:19:13,860
and then turns into the
final, uh, discussion, uh,

314
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:18,610
that you see on whatever
page it is in the book. Okay.

315
00:19:18,670 --> 00:19:23,350
Um, let me move on.
There was a, uh, another,

316
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:26,680
um, interesting, uh,
level one can get too,

317
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:31,780
which I think is worth talking
about a little bit. And, and uh,

318
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:36,490
I sort of think of it, this is the,
the discovery that people tend to ask,

319
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:39,420
you know, they go, well, you're
a scientist doing research.

320
00:19:39,421 --> 00:19:42,670
He was taking time out to this other
thing. And then the question always is,

321
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:47,620
has that other thing informed,
uh, informed your, your,
uh, your physics? Have you,

322
00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:51,310
have you discovered anything because
you've been doing art? And, um,

323
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:55,960
so the honest answer
is, um, not really. Um,

324
00:19:57,190 --> 00:20:01,420
I wish, I wish there was a, a
fantastic story. I could tell you. Um,

325
00:20:01,930 --> 00:20:03,490
uh, you know, there's, there's,

326
00:20:03,491 --> 00:20:06,960
there's nothing I'm going to be writing
up in the journal anytime soon. Um,

327
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,420
that that came from, from, uh,
from, from this enterprise.

328
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:15,580
And I don't think that is a necessary
thing to legitimize, uh, doing this.

329
00:20:15,581 --> 00:20:19,580
I think, uh, the, the mission we were
talking about at the beginning is, is, is,

330
00:20:19,581 --> 00:20:23,780
is more than enough. Um,
but I should say, uh,

331
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:24,790
generally speaking,

332
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:30,000
the process by which you think clearly
or try to think clearly about how to

333
00:20:30,221 --> 00:20:35,050
explain ideas to people always
reflects, uh, um, always, uh,

334
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:39,010
uh, back, reacts positively on how
you think about your actual research.

335
00:20:39,011 --> 00:20:40,900
And I'm sure many of you know that.
So,

336
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:45,430
so there probably are things as I think
about more clearly as a result of having,

337
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:50,890
um, put the time into figuring
out how to say it in a,

338
00:20:50,891 --> 00:20:55,480
in the book. Um, but I do, I
do have a little bit of a joke,

339
00:20:55,481 --> 00:20:58,680
but there's a very serious point,
uh, that, that, uh, that I,

340
00:20:58,681 --> 00:21:03,220
I did discover a new equation and that's
the equation. Comics equals physics.

341
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:07,910
And there's actually a serious point,
uh, those of you who are maybe a,

342
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:11,030
I have more than a passing
interest in comics know that, uh,

343
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:16,180
there's a well established, um, thing
that said, uh, it said very well.

344
00:21:16,181 --> 00:21:20,530
And for example, Scott McCloud's
books or um, or, um, uh,

345
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:25,560
will Eisner's books about how sequential
artworks that comics are not a passive

346
00:21:25,781 --> 00:21:29,680
medium. Um, uh, you actually as a reader,

347
00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:33,320
you're doing something very active
and what you're doing is your, your,

348
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:38,440
your taking a sequence of images
that are laid out in a certain order.

349
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:42,010
Um, uh, and with a certain
convention about the audio,

350
00:21:42,011 --> 00:21:45,580
read them in a and w w once you,
once you do that,

351
00:21:45,581 --> 00:21:47,500
what you're doing is
you're creating space.

352
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:50,680
You're creating an active sense
of space and also have time.

353
00:21:50,681 --> 00:21:52,120
There's a sense of passing of time.

354
00:21:52,810 --> 00:21:56,410
And it's very important when
you're designing comics to
actually understand that,

355
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:58,510
um,
because it allows you to play with.

356
00:21:58,511 --> 00:22:03,511
It allows you to manipulate how the
reader gets what you're trying to get them

357
00:22:03,701 --> 00:22:07,480
to get a off the page. Um, and, uh,

358
00:22:07,481 --> 00:22:09,680
so that's sort of a well known thing,
but I,

359
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:14,740
I think one can go actually much further
than that because in much of the book

360
00:22:14,801 --> 00:22:19,240
I'm talking about ideas about
space and time in physics.

361
00:22:19,690 --> 00:22:22,170
And so what better medium,
uh,

362
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:26,230
to have that kind of
discussion in, uh, then,

363
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:30,550
uh, then, uh, a book that's, you know,

364
00:22:30,551 --> 00:22:35,140
depends so much on the reader
to construct space and time. So,

365
00:22:35,170 --> 00:22:36,760
uh,
with that in mind,

366
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:41,790
I can actually start playing with
the physics ideas by playing with the

367
00:22:42,371 --> 00:22:46,360
structure of the page in terms of how
the panels are laid out and things like

368
00:22:46,361 --> 00:22:50,020
that. Um, so comics equal physics
is sort of a serious thing.

369
00:22:50,021 --> 00:22:53,220
I think physics is extremely
well adapted to comics. Uh,

370
00:22:53,230 --> 00:22:57,670
the construction of space and
time that happens in comics. Um,

371
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:02,380
allows you then to do things like
this. A, there's a conversation where,

372
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:04,150
uh, the, the,

373
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:09,510
the discussion that's taking place in
the field right now about what may happen

374
00:23:10,150 --> 00:23:12,070
in the early universe,
for example,

375
00:23:12,071 --> 00:23:14,200
around the time of the big
bang or slightly before,

376
00:23:14,201 --> 00:23:19,201
depending upon how you define the big
bang space and time itself may not be very

377
00:23:19,301 --> 00:23:21,380
much if at all.
Um,

378
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:26,430
even close to the way we think of space
and time right now. It may break down in,

379
00:23:26,431 --> 00:23:28,150
in,
in certain interesting ways.

380
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:31,390
So I can actually have that
conversation taking place.

381
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:34,270
And while it's taking place in words,

382
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:38,980
it's also happening in the
panel structures where the
panel itself is dissolving

383
00:23:39,070 --> 00:23:42,760
in a way analogous to what's supposed
to be happening to space and time,

384
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:46,470
the space and time of our universe
that's being this, uh, this,

385
00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:50,540
this solution that's happening
here actually spreads out onto, um,

386
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:55,960
onto, uh, another, um,
another page. And, uh, and,

387
00:23:55,961 --> 00:24:00,050
and it continues there in an interesting
way. So it's a little bit playful here.

388
00:24:00,051 --> 00:24:04,760
It's not essential to discussion,
but it certainly, uh, having the,

389
00:24:04,761 --> 00:24:08,960
the page itself resonate with the idea.
I think is another way of getting, uh,

390
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:13,400
getting it to sort of sink in what's
going on. And, uh, so that sort of Nice.

391
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:16,610
Um, and, uh, it was a fun
thing to do once I realized,

392
00:24:16,611 --> 00:24:20,030
I realized very late in the process,
um, that this was a possibility.

393
00:24:20,031 --> 00:24:23,650
So I probably would've done a lot more
headache, realized that earlier and I, I,

394
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:28,250
it would be fun to revisit
some of that, um, in, in, uh,
in perhaps in a, in a sequel.

395
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:33,040
Here's another, um, uh, perhaps
a more subtle example, uh,

396
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:37,370
two people that are discussing what,
uh, what's, uh, thought to happen,

397
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:40,640
uh,
following Einstein's equations.

398
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:43,150
Um, uh, yeah,

399
00:24:43,230 --> 00:24:45,070
uh,
in the interior of a black hole.

400
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:46,853
Okay.

401
00:24:47,410 --> 00:24:48,041
And,
uh,

402
00:24:48,041 --> 00:24:51,400
so they're discussing the whole idea
of as you go deeper and deeper into the

403
00:24:51,401 --> 00:24:55,900
black hole of various kinds
of things happen. Um, but, uh,

404
00:24:55,930 --> 00:24:59,920
one of the things that Einstein's
equations, uh, tells you happens,

405
00:24:59,921 --> 00:25:03,670
which we actually think probably gets
strongly modified by quantum effects,

406
00:25:03,671 --> 00:25:05,820
that we're still trying to figure out,
um,

407
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:09,630
is that a space and time
begin to, uh, get, uh,

408
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:12,490
confused what you thought
of a space is now time,

409
00:25:12,491 --> 00:25:15,760
what you thought of his time is now space.
It's all getting very confused.

410
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:18,370
So again,
I had that in words,

411
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:22,840
but then the other thing I do
on this page is I have, um,

412
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:28,500
a resonance a with that idea by having
the order in which you read the panels be

413
00:25:30,251 --> 00:25:34,810
the wrong order. So I'm sort of
breaking down space and time, uh,

414
00:25:34,811 --> 00:25:38,650
that you construct as the reader and
breaking that down. You're reading in a,

415
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:41,710
in a, in a cyclic order as
opposed to the one, two, three,

416
00:25:41,711 --> 00:25:44,950
four you would normally do in
order to make sense of those words.

417
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:48,580
And so I'm sort of playing with your
head a little bit as you're reading about

418
00:25:48,581 --> 00:25:52,510
the breakdown of space and time. Uh,
you're getting some, some dissonance,

419
00:25:52,511 --> 00:25:56,920
some confusion on the page as well,
which is, uh, which is deliberate, again,

420
00:25:56,921 --> 00:25:58,470
trying to show,
uh,

421
00:25:58,630 --> 00:26:02,230
through the panel structure
that something's funny is
happening inside the black

422
00:26:02,231 --> 00:26:06,820
hole. So, um, uh, I'll,

423
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:10,970
I think I'll end there, but just, just
end with a few hopes and the hope is, um,

424
00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:15,430
that, uh, people find this
interesting. People engage with it.

425
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:18,870
But also I hope that this
isn't just a, uh, uh,

426
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:21,760
a random weird quirk.

427
00:26:21,761 --> 00:26:24,180
And then we just go back
to the usual way of,

428
00:26:24,181 --> 00:26:27,510
of discussing science in the
public sphere. I, you know,

429
00:26:27,570 --> 00:26:29,380
I hope that maybe a other,

430
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:32,010
uh,
uh,

431
00:26:32,550 --> 00:26:34,320
writers,
scientists,

432
00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:39,290
artists might engage more
with using science. I'm sorry,

433
00:26:39,310 --> 00:26:43,020
using comics and graphic novels for
serious discussion of science. You,

434
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:47,100
there are lots of, uh, graphic
treatments or science out there,

435
00:26:47,101 --> 00:26:49,650
but they're either, um, uh,

436
00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:53,640
done with maybe more of a
comedic bent or more, you know,

437
00:26:53,641 --> 00:26:58,130
more like the sort of Sunday funnies or,
you know, sort of Gee Whiz, kind of, uh,

438
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:02,700
science stuff or stuff, uh,
for, for children, all of
which are wonderful things.

439
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:07,860
This is not any of those things.
I think a, a serious discussion,

440
00:27:08,250 --> 00:27:09,630
um,
uh,

441
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:13,140
where science has the star in character
as opposed to it being a biography or

442
00:27:13,141 --> 00:27:17,250
something. It's something that you don't
really see much, certainly in physics, um,

443
00:27:17,330 --> 00:27:20,070
in graphic novel form.
And so I, I hope to,

444
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:24,210
I hope that can change and this is an
attempt to show that this is something

445
00:27:24,211 --> 00:27:26,250
that can be done, uh, can be, uh,

446
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:30,450
successful in terms of
communicating the ideas and, um,

447
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:32,600
and get people excited.
So a,

448
00:27:32,610 --> 00:27:35,730
I'm going to stop babbling
now and maybe hear from you

449
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:44,873
mmm.

450
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:49,790
As a professor in the university to do,
do teaching students stations,

451
00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:55,470
do you use some of your skills and
all those ideas during the rotation?

452
00:27:57,311 --> 00:28:00,460
Like just usual lectures and all that?

453
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:05,220
Um, that's an interesting question.
I certainly don't have, um,

454
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:10,330
know full on graphic narratives,
uh, in, in my teaching.

455
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:15,340
Um, uh, you know, I might, uh, it's
been a while since I, uh, for example,

456
00:28:15,341 --> 00:28:19,510
total freshmen class and maybe
I might do it there. Um, uh,

457
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:23,830
it's um,
right,

458
00:28:25,810 --> 00:28:30,310
here's his assault something
I'll say. Yeah, something else.

459
00:28:30,311 --> 00:28:33,100
I think this book is, um, uh,

460
00:28:33,370 --> 00:28:38,120
trying to do is to show just how visual,
um,

461
00:28:38,170 --> 00:28:39,610
the field actually is.

462
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:45,070
And it is already the case that in
the classroom or in the seminar room,

463
00:28:45,130 --> 00:28:47,470
uh,
where one's talking about physics,

464
00:28:47,471 --> 00:28:52,210
but one's actually doing physics
research as well. It's very, very visual.

465
00:28:52,390 --> 00:28:57,390
And I don't think that's appreciated
because ironically we have our ideas.

466
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,140
Um,
you know,

467
00:28:59,141 --> 00:29:03,130
we may be billed multibillion dollar
machines to discover the particles that

468
00:29:03,131 --> 00:29:05,410
came about as a result of those ideas,
what have you.

469
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:09,130
And then we go out and we write
books about it. And, and, and we're,

470
00:29:09,150 --> 00:29:10,780
and we're encouraged to and in fact,

471
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:15,840
take pride in and communicating it
all in words and pretending that we'd

472
00:29:16,121 --> 00:29:19,570
actually didn't have this
huge visual component. So,

473
00:29:19,571 --> 00:29:24,070
so actually one of the things
I'm trying to do is, is, um, is,

474
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:25,990
is talk more about that visual component,

475
00:29:25,991 --> 00:29:28,630
have that visual component
much more upfront. So in my,

476
00:29:28,690 --> 00:29:31,940
so my classroom is already very visual,
um,

477
00:29:31,990 --> 00:29:36,160
in the sense that if you walk into
my class and look on the board,

478
00:29:36,161 --> 00:29:40,000
you will see drawings because
that's what we use. Uh, uh,

479
00:29:40,030 --> 00:29:44,680
whether it be the equations or diagrams
is associated with the equations or even

480
00:29:44,681 --> 00:29:47,860
sort of metaphorical sketches about
what the interior of the black hole is.

481
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:50,410
We do that all the time already.
So,

482
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:55,210
so in some ways I'm just bringing
more of that to the page than normally

483
00:29:55,211 --> 00:29:56,044
happens.

484
00:30:02,690 --> 00:30:06,360
That is significant efforts to,
uh,

485
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:12,800
earlier ice public with the
physics, the physics, for example,

486
00:30:12,801 --> 00:30:14,900
the space time or the
third fermilabs programs.

487
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:20,320
So how do you come where the video way
of presenting things with the comic way

488
00:30:20,991 --> 00:30:24,350
of a comic book way of presenting things?
I mean,

489
00:30:25,010 --> 00:30:29,030
this is a great question. Um,
those are wonderful things. Um,

490
00:30:29,510 --> 00:30:33,650
and I apologize, you will see
my face on a number of them too.

491
00:30:34,090 --> 00:30:38,320
Um, and, and uh, and uh,
those again, things should be,

492
00:30:38,490 --> 00:30:43,370
it should continue. Uh, but, but three
different, I think, I think video, um,

493
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:48,580
uneven animation in video form
of ideas is a wonderful thing,

494
00:30:48,711 --> 00:30:51,380
but it's still quite different.
Um,

495
00:30:51,410 --> 00:30:54,230
in some ways it's still much more passive.

496
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:59,120
I think reading of any form it engages,
engages the reader,

497
00:30:59,450 --> 00:31:00,040
uh,

498
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:05,040
in exploring the ideas and fitting it
into their head much more than sitting and

499
00:31:05,811 --> 00:31:10,400
watching, uh, a thing. Um, so, uh,

500
00:31:10,430 --> 00:31:14,530
so in some ways, um, the
comic form, uh, the graphic,

501
00:31:14,570 --> 00:31:17,620
the graphic novel form is, is, uh, is,

502
00:31:17,621 --> 00:31:21,620
is in a very interesting space that's
along a sort of different access,

503
00:31:21,621 --> 00:31:23,840
but it has commonality
with the other forms,

504
00:31:24,170 --> 00:31:27,650
but then it has this whole
thing unto itself. Uh,

505
00:31:27,651 --> 00:31:30,830
in terms of some of the things I
mentioned before, that active engagement,

506
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:35,630
you're creating some of the,
the space that's being a,

507
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:38,360
that's being imagined are on many
different levels. All those things.

508
00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:40,340
I can't think of another
medium that does that.

509
00:31:40,490 --> 00:31:44,030
People often think of comics as
basically stills of a movie. And that,

510
00:31:44,031 --> 00:31:48,620
that's such a, such an
unfortunate perception. It's
so much more than that. And,

511
00:31:48,621 --> 00:31:52,100
and, and so that's why it's incredibly
frustrating to me that comics are still

512
00:31:52,101 --> 00:31:53,870
thought of as either,
you know,

513
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:58,820
things for kids or things to talk
about superheroes, um, or, or,

514
00:31:59,030 --> 00:31:59,863
you know,

515
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:05,690
something that is so much less than
what they can be. And, and, and,

516
00:32:05,691 --> 00:32:06,790
and so,
so,

517
00:32:06,810 --> 00:32:11,810
so what I'm trying to do here is show
just how much this form can contain if we

518
00:32:12,741 --> 00:32:16,940
take it seriously and bring serious
topics to it. So I hope that,

519
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:18,493
yeah,

520
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:26,400
and I'm guessing it's much harder to
revise and this kind of presentation.

521
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:28,473
So if you,

522
00:32:28,630 --> 00:32:32,050
if you get struck as you say with an
interesting idea of how you could do

523
00:32:32,051 --> 00:32:32,884
something,

524
00:32:33,670 --> 00:32:36,760
it will be a lot of effort to go back
and change what you've already done.

525
00:32:37,210 --> 00:32:40,160
Is that going to be a
barrier to more of this kind

526
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,870
of book?
Um,

527
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:51,380
uh, I'm not sure. It depends. It
depends upon the kind of change.

528
00:32:51,530 --> 00:32:53,960
Um,
it possibly also depends upon,

529
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:55,613
uh,

530
00:32:58,410 --> 00:33:03,070
I'm not sure it's any harder,
a harder than re-editing a movie perhaps.

531
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:07,770
Um, yeah, I'm not sure how
to answer that. Yes, it can.

532
00:33:08,130 --> 00:33:12,540
It can be, uh, difficult
to, uh, make changes,

533
00:33:12,541 --> 00:33:15,000
particularly if you've designed,
if you're really using the medium,

534
00:33:15,001 --> 00:33:18,630
well then the page layout is crucial.

535
00:33:18,631 --> 00:33:23,160
Making a change here could have a knock
on effect on other parts and so on and

536
00:33:23,161 --> 00:33:27,000
so forth. And I think of
that as a positive thing
because it shows that it's a,

537
00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:33,080
it's something very complex going on
and so difficult in making changes,

538
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:36,950
you know, that's a thing. But I think
if it's worth doing, it's worth doing.

539
00:33:37,210 --> 00:33:39,910
I'm not sure how it, how else
to answer that, but it's a,

540
00:33:39,911 --> 00:33:44,690
it's a good observation though. Um,
I, I think, um, there are, you know,

541
00:33:44,691 --> 00:33:48,850
I've learned a lot about how
to do things quickly, uh,

542
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:53,240
as compared to when I first started
out. You know, I, I think, um,

543
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:57,500
I think when I was first doing this or
of course even taking into account that I

544
00:33:57,501 --> 00:34:00,860
was
doing it in my spare time and

545
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:06,890
not full time, uh, it w it would take
a very long time just to do one page.

546
00:34:07,190 --> 00:34:11,740
By time I got to, uh, the final
sprint to hand it in on, on,

547
00:34:11,990 --> 00:34:16,970
you know, on deadline to the
publisher. Uh, I was doing, um, uh,

548
00:34:17,390 --> 00:34:22,370
uh, more than one page per day.
Sometimes depending upon the style, uh,

549
00:34:22,430 --> 00:34:27,320
you know, a couple of pages a day
of, of, of, of final art. Um, so,

550
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:31,440
so there, there are many different sort
of types of technique and workflow,

551
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:34,880
some of which are easier to
make adjustments to than others.

552
00:34:34,910 --> 00:34:37,580
It really depends upon one's
one's own chosen style.

553
00:34:40,140 --> 00:34:40,973
Okay.

554
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:43,040
Back to,
well other media.

555
00:34:44,050 --> 00:34:47,630
I was just wondering about what a
woman could do something similar with

556
00:34:47,631 --> 00:34:52,010
interactive web based
type presentation,

557
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:56,690
possibly comic based as well,
but with the directive.

558
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:00,540
Yeah, there's, there's,
there's interactive, um,

559
00:35:00,590 --> 00:35:05,450
there's interactive things that can be
done on, on, on the web, on devices.

560
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:08,270
Um, uh, there's also, uh,

561
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:13,320
the growing perhaps medium of
motion comics and things like that.

562
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:18,680
I think the many things that can be done,
um, with, uh, with digital techniques, um,

563
00:35:18,681 --> 00:35:21,000
that could be in the spirit of this or,
or,

564
00:35:21,010 --> 00:35:24,320
or go off in another direction
or a law again on a, on a, on a,

565
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:29,360
on a somewhat different access, uh, to
explore different aspects. Um, so yes,

566
00:35:29,810 --> 00:35:31,520
uh, let's, let's do them all.

567
00:35:34,790 --> 00:35:38,040
You talked about being inspired by
a lot of the classic dialogues and

568
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:42,240
all the ones I'm familiar with are between
a teacher and a student to our master

569
00:35:42,241 --> 00:35:45,630
and a scholar where it seems like one
of the Pr people is just there to ask

570
00:35:45,631 --> 00:35:47,220
leading questions.
Um,

571
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:50,490
did you find yourself using that same
frame since I've only spent 10 seconds

572
00:35:50,491 --> 00:35:53,430
with the book or did you find
another way to modernize it or do,

573
00:35:53,550 --> 00:35:57,720
um, you'll find mixtures of that. I
mean, it's certainly the case that, um,

574
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:03,080
that there are some pairings that one
person has more expertise in the other.

575
00:36:03,450 --> 00:36:07,020
Um, but I still didn't want it
to be even in that case. Well,

576
00:36:07,050 --> 00:36:09,060
in all of those cases where that happens,

577
00:36:09,330 --> 00:36:12,900
I still don't want it to
be master and student. Um,

578
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:16,200
because I think that almost defeats
the purpose of what I was trying to do.

579
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:18,570
Going back to my,
uh,

580
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:23,580
my non critique of the sort of
standard books that we write.

581
00:36:23,910 --> 00:36:28,260
Um, uh, one of the other things that can
turn people off is that that tone of,

582
00:36:28,290 --> 00:36:31,650
here I am stepping out of the ivory
tower to tell you how you're supposed to

583
00:36:31,651 --> 00:36:36,570
think about things. And they really
wanted to avoid that tone. Um, and,

584
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:39,660
uh, so even when it is an
expert in the non-expert,

585
00:36:39,750 --> 00:36:44,160
they really equals out there in the
world. And, and people often go, oh,

586
00:36:44,161 --> 00:36:47,190
but it's just another lecture
cause that presence an expert.

587
00:36:47,370 --> 00:36:50,010
And so they're not ordinary people out
there in the world. And I want to go,

588
00:36:50,011 --> 00:36:50,371
actually,

589
00:36:50,371 --> 00:36:53,640
scientists are ordinary people and we
can be out there in the world and we do

590
00:36:53,641 --> 00:36:56,070
drink coffee and take the
train and so on and so forth.

591
00:36:56,250 --> 00:36:59,790
And we meet ordinary people in the world
just like we, we're ordinary people.

592
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:01,360
And so you,
you'll see,

593
00:37:01,361 --> 00:37:05,340
you will see pairings where that's
helpful in order to get somewhere with the

594
00:37:05,341 --> 00:37:09,720
material. Um, in a longer version
of this book, um, uh, you know,

595
00:37:09,721 --> 00:37:13,800
before I had to make decisions
about the final content,

596
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:18,670
there actually are more conversations
between non-experts and, and,

597
00:37:18,671 --> 00:37:21,050
and I wanted the freedom to,
uh,

598
00:37:21,051 --> 00:37:24,630
allow people to say things that
actually aren't right as well,

599
00:37:24,631 --> 00:37:27,870
to make guesses about things or to
extrapolate and wrong directions.

600
00:37:28,030 --> 00:37:32,190
But then what has to be much more careful
about finding ways than of undoing

601
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:37,220
that so that you're not
getting people walking away
from that story, uh, with, um,

602
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:40,980
with, uh, with, with the wrong
impressions. And, and there are some,

603
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:43,590
there are some example
as examples of that,

604
00:37:43,591 --> 00:37:47,250
but fewer of them made it to this book.
But I will be revisiting that.

605
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:56,600
And I'm curious about your decision
early on to decide to go straight to

606
00:37:56,601 --> 00:38:00,310
yourself and I'm wondering whether you
could share some thoughts about the pros

607
00:38:00,311 --> 00:38:05,311
and cons of either doing the visual side
yourself or partnering with someone,

608
00:38:07,061 --> 00:38:07,310
you know,

609
00:38:07,310 --> 00:38:11,290
have you thought about the disadvantages
and what advice would you have to other

610
00:38:11,470 --> 00:38:14,170
academics and researchers
who are interested in doing

611
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:18,210
that? That's, that's a
great question. Um, uh,

612
00:38:19,290 --> 00:38:20,123
great.

613
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:24,000
The decision Wa well,

614
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:25,633
okay.

615
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:29,360
Some of you may have a theoretical physics
background. I have a, I don't know,

616
00:38:29,361 --> 00:38:33,410
but certainly in our field and maybe
another in other sort of research areas

617
00:38:33,411 --> 00:38:37,060
like that where we're constantly,
that process by which we go,

618
00:38:37,450 --> 00:38:41,140
my research is taking me into that
direction and there's a whole bunch of

619
00:38:41,141 --> 00:38:46,030
techniques, um, uh, you know, new kinds
of code or new kinds of mathematics or,

620
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:50,410
or new kinds of physical ideas that I
either need to teach myself or just invent

621
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:53,860
in order to go off in that direction.
So it's just sort of common to do that.

622
00:38:53,861 --> 00:38:55,990
So my first instinct always is,

623
00:38:55,991 --> 00:38:59,200
and it's the way I've always
been since I was a kid, is just,

624
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:01,810
just figure out what I need
to go in that direction.

625
00:39:01,811 --> 00:39:06,490
So that was my first instinct. Um, and uh,

626
00:39:06,850 --> 00:39:11,350
uh,
collaborating though is a wonderful thing.

627
00:39:12,610 --> 00:39:17,330
And, uh, one of the things I was
concerned about, however, is that a, well,

628
00:39:17,331 --> 00:39:21,880
the two fold one is that there really
wasn't anything else like this out there.

629
00:39:22,510 --> 00:39:25,360
So trying to work with some,
I, you know, I already,

630
00:39:25,361 --> 00:39:29,890
when I first tried to explain to people
what it was I was trying to do, um,

631
00:39:30,310 --> 00:39:33,910
uh, I kept getting people, uh, you know,

632
00:39:34,810 --> 00:39:37,240
trying to make guesses what
they thought were helpful,

633
00:39:37,241 --> 00:39:42,000
suggestions about what the book should
be based on what people do. You know,

634
00:39:42,030 --> 00:39:45,490
what they already know. And,
and I kept going, no, no,
no, I don't want to do that.

635
00:39:45,491 --> 00:39:47,200
I don't want to do,
I didn't want to do an adventure story.

636
00:39:47,201 --> 00:39:49,650
I don't want to do a biography.
I don't want to do it. Blah,
blah, blah, blah, blah,

637
00:39:49,651 --> 00:39:50,320
blah,
blah.

638
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:53,530
And so at some point I just stopped
telling people about it because they were

639
00:39:53,531 --> 00:39:58,531
trying to essentially infiltrate my
idea with just making me do more of the

640
00:39:58,661 --> 00:40:00,490
same.
Um,

641
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:04,780
my worry then also is trying to
get a professional artist, uh,

642
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:09,160
on board is that I would also have that
process whereby I'd be trying to explain

643
00:40:09,161 --> 00:40:13,120
to them that I wasn't trying to do this.
I wasn't trying to do that other thing.

644
00:40:13,150 --> 00:40:15,840
This is what I'm trying to do. And I
just, I, and, and so there was this,

645
00:40:15,841 --> 00:40:18,670
this anticipation of the frustration
of that process. I just thought,

646
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:21,070
let me get least first,
see whether I can just do it myself.

647
00:40:21,670 --> 00:40:26,200
Then there's also the issue of if I'm
getting an artist that doesn't necessarily

648
00:40:26,201 --> 00:40:29,130
know any science, um, uh,

649
00:40:29,131 --> 00:40:33,470
I would then be spending a fair
amount of time translating and,

650
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:37,540
and some things may be lost
in translation. They may
do this beautiful page,

651
00:40:37,541 --> 00:40:41,920
but you know, the actual idea I
was trying to, yeah. And then,

652
00:40:41,950 --> 00:40:45,340
and then also, I think you missed you. I
would've had, I had I gone with an artist.

653
00:40:45,341 --> 00:40:49,450
I think I probably wouldn't have delved
into researching how graphic novels work

654
00:40:49,451 --> 00:40:52,960
as much as I did and I wouldn't have
discovered, you know, my equation,

655
00:40:53,710 --> 00:40:55,020
quote unquote,
uh,

656
00:40:55,060 --> 00:41:00,060
the idea that there are opportunities
in the structure of the medium itself to

657
00:41:00,671 --> 00:41:04,090
resonate with the physics
ideas. And, uh, I, I,

658
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:08,830
I simply would not have come upon
that and I think that was a value.

659
00:41:09,010 --> 00:41:12,130
So, um, so, uh,

660
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:16,390
it certainly is not the only way of
doing this. However, um, and I think,

661
00:41:16,750 --> 00:41:21,250
um, people are very welcome to, to, to,

662
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:24,190
to try it in different ways,
either doing the,

663
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:27,040
doing the art themselves or,
um,

664
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:29,770
or working with a collaborator.

665
00:41:30,010 --> 00:41:35,010
There also are very good artists out
there who also appreciate and love science

666
00:41:35,151 --> 00:41:39,560
and, and, uh, you know, really champing
at the bit to do this kind of project, uh,

667
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:43,610
with, with a physics collaborator. There's
a actually a really good example. Um,

668
00:41:44,690 --> 00:41:49,190
um, the Phd Comics Guy Jorge Charm, uh,

669
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:51,710
collaborated with Daniel Watson to do,

670
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:55,230
it's not quite a graphic novel,
but it's a,

671
00:41:55,360 --> 00:42:00,300
it's a prose book with lots of Fun
Phd comic style illustrations and,

672
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:04,850
and, and, and they're, you know, they
both engage with the science in, in, in,

673
00:42:04,851 --> 00:42:08,440
in that project. And so the
collaborations like that, but there,

674
00:42:08,441 --> 00:42:13,100
there could also be very sort
of, uh, um, writerly, sorry,

675
00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:18,440
a scientist is writer, artist
type, uh, collaborations,

676
00:42:18,470 --> 00:42:22,010
um, uh, where, you know, you just,

677
00:42:22,011 --> 00:42:26,480
you just collaborate on trying to tell
the story as best you can. So, um,

678
00:42:26,870 --> 00:42:28,340
I,
I think all those,

679
00:42:28,370 --> 00:42:32,360
all those methods will produce
interesting books and I think, um,

680
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:35,630
we should try all of those things.
I just think we've been,

681
00:42:35,690 --> 00:42:39,890
we've just for a field that's normally
very, very innovative, which is physics,

682
00:42:39,891 --> 00:42:44,780
I think we've been really behind
the curve on innovations in books,

683
00:42:45,380 --> 00:42:47,540
uh, for, for how we get people excited.

684
00:42:47,541 --> 00:42:52,180
So it's time to start trying
all sorts of things. Um,

685
00:42:52,330 --> 00:42:56,920
some, uh, lots of concepts in equations
and physics seem to lend themselves quite

686
00:42:56,921 --> 00:42:59,710
naturally to visual
ways of explaining that.

687
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:02,710
I think some are a
really abstract and with,

688
00:43:02,830 --> 00:43:04,810
were there any that you kind of
wanted to include in the book,

689
00:43:04,811 --> 00:43:06,420
but you're actually
stumped and you thought,

690
00:43:06,421 --> 00:43:11,050
actually I just can't explain
this in a simple way. Um, hmm.

691
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:18,510
Yeah, I haven't, uh, I that certainly
didn't happen in the process of, of,

692
00:43:18,540 --> 00:43:19,680
of doing the book I had.

693
00:43:21,270 --> 00:43:21,870
Okay.

694
00:43:21,870 --> 00:43:25,320
Maybe I, maybe I had already, uh, uh,

695
00:43:25,470 --> 00:43:30,470
preselected ideas that lend themselves
well to being expressed visually when it,

696
00:43:32,371 --> 00:43:35,910
when I was sort of
carving, um, uh, you know,

697
00:43:35,911 --> 00:43:38,430
carving out a chunk to put into the book.
Um,

698
00:43:38,460 --> 00:43:42,370
since then I have been
thinking about it. Um, I,

699
00:43:42,630 --> 00:43:46,980
I would like the opportunity
perhaps to visit, um,

700
00:43:47,580 --> 00:43:49,170
uh,

701
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:53,940
more deeply some ideas from
quantum physics in this form. Um,

702
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:58,290
usually what happens is you end up
just drawing lots of fuzzy blobs and,

703
00:43:58,291 --> 00:43:59,310
you know, there's a, there's a,

704
00:43:59,820 --> 00:44:02,580
there's a point and then there's
a fuzzy blob and what have you.

705
00:44:02,581 --> 00:44:06,120
And Quantum fuzziness,
uh, gets used a lot,

706
00:44:06,121 --> 00:44:10,410
but not really exploiting
that form very much.

707
00:44:10,411 --> 00:44:15,330
And I do wonder whether there are
ways of doing it. So I, you know,

708
00:44:15,390 --> 00:44:16,223
let's see,

709
00:44:16,380 --> 00:44:21,380
maybe there'll be a volume to where I
actually try and use the comic form full

710
00:44:21,811 --> 00:44:26,070
on two to address concepts
in quantum physics. Um,

711
00:44:26,850 --> 00:44:31,610
we'll see. I actually to, uh,

712
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:32,130
wanted

713
00:44:32,130 --> 00:44:36,240
to come back a little bit more to
your question with regard to the, the,

714
00:44:36,241 --> 00:44:41,040
the sort of status of the, of the,
uh, interlocutors, uh, because, uh,

715
00:44:41,190 --> 00:44:44,760
not, not only I do, I think of them
and hopefully present them as equals.

716
00:44:45,430 --> 00:44:50,220
Um, but I also show in many cases
where the, the, the perhaps,

717
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:53,850
uh, confident expert is, is, is, is,

718
00:44:53,870 --> 00:44:57,540
is tripped up by some of the
questions. Uh, and, and, and,

719
00:44:57,541 --> 00:45:01,630
or maybe they push back on each other
in ways so that there's a, for example,

720
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:06,510
a conversation on the train
where, um, where, uh, um, to,

721
00:45:06,570 --> 00:45:09,870
to, to people one, an expert at one,

722
00:45:09,871 --> 00:45:14,060
an astrophysicist and one
whatever it is, they do, um, uh,

723
00:45:14,490 --> 00:45:19,350
start discussing the nature of time and
it goes off an interesting philosophical

724
00:45:19,351 --> 00:45:21,960
directions and also,
uh, directions do with,

725
00:45:21,961 --> 00:45:24,870
with a black hole physics and also
directions to do with religion.

726
00:45:25,650 --> 00:45:30,230
And they really push against each other
in interesting ways as, as equals, uh,

727
00:45:30,270 --> 00:45:35,250
coming from their own perspectives, uh,
to that conversation. So, so, you know,

728
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:38,710
I hope that's another example of it
not being sort of master student. Yeah.

729
00:45:40,430 --> 00:45:44,080
Okay.
Awesome.

730
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:50,250
What do you want it to say?
Whether you had

731
00:45:52,620 --> 00:45:56,430
made a decision to want fans of science,

732
00:45:57,900 --> 00:45:58,733
the expert?

733
00:46:00,220 --> 00:46:05,220
Well for someone who enjoys reading about
the theories of silence or trained as

734
00:46:06,601 --> 00:46:08,520
working in the this area.

735
00:46:09,130 --> 00:46:11,710
Um, uh, definitely, uh,

736
00:46:11,770 --> 00:46:15,460
it's meant to be a book that I
hope one day to be, you know,

737
00:46:15,461 --> 00:46:20,140
on the pick of the design and just see
a random person from a random field

738
00:46:21,910 --> 00:46:25,840
of a random age of a random
background reading. I really,

739
00:46:25,910 --> 00:46:29,980
I really want to make it sort of for
everybody. In fact, I had this battle,

740
00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:31,850
uh,
you know,

741
00:46:31,930 --> 00:46:35,440
I could give you an entire talk about
trying to get a book that's this unusual

742
00:46:35,441 --> 00:46:37,120
published,
uh,

743
00:46:37,150 --> 00:46:42,150
because people want you to say
very narrowly what group of,

744
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:47,440
what demographic is this for.
Uh, and, and, and I really
pushed back against that.

745
00:46:47,470 --> 00:46:51,970
I think it should be possible to
create books that offer everybody,

746
00:46:51,971 --> 00:46:55,500
not in some sort of vague sense, but
in the very specific sense of, uh,

747
00:46:55,720 --> 00:47:00,070
we need to let go of the idea that
you can open a book and necessarily,

748
00:47:00,700 --> 00:47:05,380
uh, uh, read it from cover to cover
and get everything that first time.

749
00:47:06,170 --> 00:47:07,480
Um,
in fact,

750
00:47:07,481 --> 00:47:12,100
if you're writing a book about complex
ideas that people have been researching

751
00:47:12,101 --> 00:47:15,460
on for hundreds of years, if, if,

752
00:47:15,670 --> 00:47:19,840
if someone can pick it up and,
and read it just all in one,

753
00:47:19,841 --> 00:47:21,700
go and get everything,
uh,

754
00:47:21,790 --> 00:47:25,570
maybe you're not trying
hard enough because I think,

755
00:47:25,590 --> 00:47:28,790
I think difficult ideas should,
uh,

756
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:33,700
I mean difficult quote unquote cause
difficult as a matter of perspective. Um,

757
00:47:33,790 --> 00:47:35,560
uh, should, uh,

758
00:47:35,830 --> 00:47:38,920
should lead you should
leave you wanting more.

759
00:47:39,130 --> 00:47:42,520
You should be able to engage with it to
some level and maybe not get everything

760
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:46,450
and have the joy of coming back later
and finding that you understand more or

761
00:47:46,451 --> 00:47:51,130
going, okay, that gave me a taste
of, uh, what this idea is like.

762
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:54,980
Um, and now I'll, uh,
I'll, uh, I'll, I'll,

763
00:47:55,300 --> 00:47:57,350
I'll go do something else for a while,
um,

764
00:47:57,580 --> 00:48:00,820
or have a sense of why it's important
if I didn't get all the ideas.

765
00:48:01,060 --> 00:48:05,980
So what I'm trying to say is
that, um, uh, I hope the book is,

766
00:48:06,040 --> 00:48:10,540
is an invitation to
engage with these ideas.

767
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:13,510
Um, not necessarily, um,

768
00:48:13,570 --> 00:48:17,890
all chapters will be for everybody.
Um,

769
00:48:18,070 --> 00:48:21,190
there are some chapters that perhaps go
into a little bit more technical detail

770
00:48:21,191 --> 00:48:23,170
then some other chapters.
Um,

771
00:48:23,410 --> 00:48:28,090
but still none of those chapters
are meant for experts. Um, uh, they,

772
00:48:28,091 --> 00:48:29,710
they really,
they really are not.

773
00:48:29,810 --> 00:48:34,100
Um, uh, yeah, uh, yeah,

774
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:37,690
uh, they really offer, you
know, the lay person, um, uh,

775
00:48:37,790 --> 00:48:41,990
interested in science and
there's a huge, um, uh,

776
00:48:42,020 --> 00:48:47,020
number of people out there who
have a thirst for science ideas.

777
00:48:47,290 --> 00:48:51,320
Um, some of them will go to the section
of the bookstore that says science and

778
00:48:51,321 --> 00:48:54,500
they'll go and pick up a book.
And many of them, actually,

779
00:48:54,501 --> 00:48:56,960
most of them don't go to that section.

780
00:48:57,260 --> 00:49:01,220
They prefer to think of themselves
maybe as visual people or however they,

781
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:03,110
you know, whatever box they
want to put themselves in.

782
00:49:03,290 --> 00:49:06,260
And they'll watch a documentary
on TV or something like that,

783
00:49:06,261 --> 00:49:07,130
but they won't pick up

784
00:49:08,610 --> 00:49:09,443
no

785
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:13,400
Roger Penrose or, uh, you know, um,

786
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:17,360
frank wheelchair or any of these really
interesting writers engaging with

787
00:49:17,361 --> 00:49:22,210
science, uh, through through
book form. Um, hopefully, uh,

788
00:49:22,250 --> 00:49:25,910
this book is, is, is a way that
might get them to get excited.

789
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:29,000
They're also people who might pick it up
thinking it's a graphic novel and it is

790
00:49:29,001 --> 00:49:33,140
a graphic novel and find, Oh, science
is actually kind of interesting. Um,

791
00:49:33,260 --> 00:49:35,570
what I did is at the end of every chapter,

792
00:49:35,571 --> 00:49:39,140
I have lots of suggestions
for further reading,

793
00:49:39,230 --> 00:49:44,230
so I will send them to find out more in
Roger Penrose or frank wheelchair or you

794
00:49:45,271 --> 00:49:45,410
know,

795
00:49:45,410 --> 00:49:49,190
any of the other really great writers
out there who are thinking about things,

796
00:49:49,450 --> 00:49:53,390
uh, in prose form that presenting
things in prose form and um,

797
00:49:53,420 --> 00:49:57,800
but they might get a taste of the
beginning of the ideas first, um,

798
00:49:57,860 --> 00:50:00,350
uh, in, um, in, in the book.

799
00:50:00,351 --> 00:50:03,800
So I don't know if that
answers the question is sort
of a long rambling answer,

800
00:50:03,801 --> 00:50:05,330
but I think it's a,
it's a complex issue.

801
00:50:06,040 --> 00:50:06,873
Yes.

802
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:16,270
I think, I think you might've claim, yeah.

803
00:50:16,300 --> 00:50:19,910
Where did you kind of see the book sitting
in, in the big stuff, even that it's

804
00:50:21,490 --> 00:50:24,080
fictional content within
a fictional setting. Yeah.

805
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:26,980
And how you would avoid kind of
confusion with that. This, um,

806
00:50:28,010 --> 00:50:32,210
this has caused me a set many
and continues to cause me many.

807
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:33,073
Uh,

808
00:50:34,550 --> 00:50:38,480
I was nights I've lost sleep because I,
that I,

809
00:50:38,481 --> 00:50:42,560
that point I lose control because now
it's all about the publisher and the

810
00:50:42,561 --> 00:50:45,320
bookstores, but actually more the
bookstores than anything else.

811
00:50:45,710 --> 00:50:48,710
And the problem is that,
um,

812
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:53,750
people will pick up the book and they're
trying to decide what shelf to put it

813
00:50:53,751 --> 00:50:56,570
on. And despite the fact
that I keep screaming,

814
00:50:56,600 --> 00:51:01,280
it's a nonfiction book about science.
And first and foremost,

815
00:51:01,370 --> 00:51:02,780
that's the section it belongs in.

816
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:06,710
But it's very hard to go into one of
these bookstores and find it there.

817
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:11,120
Um, uh, because I think people will
just go, oh, it's got pictures.

818
00:51:11,121 --> 00:51:12,830
It's the children's book.

819
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:17,840
So I actually just the other day had to
politely ask for someone to move it from

820
00:51:17,841 --> 00:51:21,620
the children's book section to the science
book sections. Right. Right. Over there.

821
00:51:21,950 --> 00:51:23,600
And, uh, and then, and then,

822
00:51:23,630 --> 00:51:27,710
or it might be in the graphic book section
and the graphic novel section, which,

823
00:51:27,740 --> 00:51:31,100
which I'm happy with too. Um, uh,

824
00:51:31,580 --> 00:51:35,540
I would like it ideally to be in all
of those sections. Now, of course,

825
00:51:35,810 --> 00:51:39,770
bookstores only have limited shelf
space, so that's a hard sell. Um,

826
00:51:40,580 --> 00:51:45,290
uh, so, um, I, I would
really love to see it,

827
00:51:45,740 --> 00:51:47,090
to answer your question directly,

828
00:51:47,210 --> 00:51:50,600
my fantasy about where it should be
is on those tables in the middle,

829
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:57,760
um, where people can stumble on
it and, and, and see that it,

830
00:51:57,810 --> 00:52:01,590
it, it, it, it both doesn't, doesn't
fit in any of those sections. And I,

831
00:52:01,630 --> 00:52:05,090
I really think they should be more room
for books that are hard to classify.

832
00:52:05,480 --> 00:52:06,830
Unfortunately.
And this,

833
00:52:06,860 --> 00:52:10,460
the way things are set up now is
something is hard to classify.

834
00:52:10,730 --> 00:52:14,840
It disappears because people get confused
and there's just too much effort.

835
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:19,670
So let's not even worry. So, so that's
the thing. I'm, I'm, I'm fighting most,

836
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:24,050
uh, um, uh, uh,

837
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:28,850
right now I'm at the stage of the book's
out. It's also difficult to get it,

838
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:33,440
uh, um, sort of talked about
by the usual outlets because,

839
00:52:33,880 --> 00:52:35,810
you know, a publication
for example, goes, well,

840
00:52:35,811 --> 00:52:38,120
this our graphic novel people
should talk about that.

841
00:52:38,121 --> 00:52:39,950
It's the comic book and
the Comic Book People Go,

842
00:52:39,951 --> 00:52:44,360
but there was no superheroes or it's,
you know, not a tortured memoir. So,

843
00:52:44,930 --> 00:52:49,400
or it's got too much science in it. And so
it ends up, again, getting, getting lost.

844
00:52:49,401 --> 00:52:51,430
So it, it's, it's, it's
one of the frustrations.

845
00:52:51,431 --> 00:52:56,431
So I'm hoping that in this world where
a word of mouth has a lot more power

846
00:52:57,891 --> 00:52:59,390
through social media and things like that,

847
00:52:59,391 --> 00:53:03,260
that I can combat some of
that classification problem
by just having people talk

848
00:53:03,261 --> 00:53:07,190
about it and go, hey, I really enjoy this.
I don't care what section it goes in. Uh,

849
00:53:07,250 --> 00:53:11,240
I enjoyed reading it, so that's, that's
the hope. So please talk about it.

850
00:53:13,870 --> 00:53:14,703
Uh,
yeah.

851
00:53:15,430 --> 00:53:20,360
So you both mentioned in the introduction
that you consulted on superhero movies

852
00:53:21,100 --> 00:53:23,640
and I was wondering about that
just a fun thing for you should do,

853
00:53:23,641 --> 00:53:28,641
or was it another way to try engage people
with science and how do you reconcile

854
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:30,673
like,

855
00:53:30,870 --> 00:53:35,580
having real science and also
in the context of those movies?

856
00:53:35,820 --> 00:53:39,910
I mean, like fantasy, divine
magic sign habits. So both,

857
00:53:39,910 --> 00:53:44,390
right. Yeah. Um, so to the first
part of your question, um, um,

858
00:53:45,590 --> 00:53:50,240
I think of it as real work. Uh,
it's one of the problems I have, uh,

859
00:53:50,270 --> 00:53:51,290
doing this kind of work,

860
00:53:51,291 --> 00:53:56,291
putting serious hours into science
advising for the entertainment industry.

861
00:53:57,120 --> 00:54:01,970
Um, people assume I'm just sort of
goofing off with my Hollywood buddies. Um,

862
00:54:02,020 --> 00:54:06,800
and, and don't realize that it
takes a huge amount of work, uh, to,

863
00:54:06,890 --> 00:54:11,450
to, you know, to do it in a, in
a useful, um, uh, impactful way.

864
00:54:12,230 --> 00:54:16,370
Um, uh, and it varies
from project to project.

865
00:54:16,371 --> 00:54:21,290
Sometimes it's a conversation. Other
Times I'm reading, uh, you know,

866
00:54:21,490 --> 00:54:26,490
uh, for example, for the, I know
if you saw that show, um, uh,

867
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:31,510
about Einstein's life and work
last year called genius, um,

868
00:54:32,120 --> 00:54:34,670
you know, with that I was teaching
them a lot of the science.

869
00:54:34,840 --> 00:54:37,820
I was helping them select aspects
of the science that could be used to

870
00:54:37,821 --> 00:54:39,950
illustrate Einstein's life.
And I was,

871
00:54:39,951 --> 00:54:44,450
I was giving a detailed notes
on every hour long script, uh,

872
00:54:44,750 --> 00:54:49,430
and, uh, you know, doing a lot of back
and forth. That's a lot of time. Um,

873
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:54,170
why do I do it? Because I think it's
incredibly an incredibly powerful medium.

874
00:54:54,171 --> 00:54:58,190
It's where, uh, you know, whatever
age group you're talking about,

875
00:54:58,191 --> 00:55:02,330
whether it be adults or children or what
have you, that's where the eyeballs are.

876
00:55:02,950 --> 00:55:07,700
Um, uh, as, as soon as they leave the
classroom or as soon as people leave work,

877
00:55:07,850 --> 00:55:11,510
they're going to entertainment.
So why wouldn't we be there if we,

878
00:55:11,570 --> 00:55:15,790
if we really care about science
being part of our every day, uh,

879
00:55:15,830 --> 00:55:20,450
engagement. So for me, I think, um, uh,

880
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:25,050
that's a marvelous space to be involved
in when I get the opportunity, uh,

881
00:55:25,550 --> 00:55:29,420
to get people excited
about science. Now. Uh,

882
00:55:29,421 --> 00:55:34,320
so I do both fiction and nonfiction,
uh, projects when I can. And I,

883
00:55:34,321 --> 00:55:38,210
I think they're equally important. Again,
there's a whole bunch of people will,

884
00:55:38,211 --> 00:55:42,470
who will go and watch a thing about
Einstein or who will watch a documentary

885
00:55:42,471 --> 00:55:46,730
about, you know, the nature of time
and what have you. And so sure,

886
00:55:46,731 --> 00:55:49,730
I put a lot of effort into,
into, into those as well.

887
00:55:49,910 --> 00:55:54,380
But there's a whole bunch of people who
potentially can be engaged by science

888
00:55:54,381 --> 00:55:56,840
who will never go and see
those things on those channels.

889
00:55:57,320 --> 00:56:02,320
But they'll go and see the latest movie
about Thor or the Avengers or what have

890
00:56:02,331 --> 00:56:02,870
you.

891
00:56:02,870 --> 00:56:07,640
And if I can sneak some ideas in there,

892
00:56:08,150 --> 00:56:13,100
uh, that can have benefit to it
might be a lot fewer science ideas,

893
00:56:13,550 --> 00:56:15,860
but it's millions more people.

894
00:56:16,310 --> 00:56:19,910
So you never know where it might,
where it might have some value.

895
00:56:20,510 --> 00:56:25,510
Now I should take a step and ask about
this whole business is sneaking some

896
00:56:25,631 --> 00:56:29,550
science in because it isn't that I'm sort
of putting spinach into your milkshake.

897
00:56:29,550 --> 00:56:34,060
As I, as I, as I, uh, as I like
to say, I'm sure of showing,

898
00:56:34,210 --> 00:56:36,600
hoping to show that,
um,

899
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:41,620
there's all kinds of flavors of
milkshake that people haven't,

900
00:56:41,910 --> 00:56:46,690
uh, um, uh, engaged with, uh, that,
that could be really awesome. And, um,

901
00:56:46,890 --> 00:56:48,730
the,
the core point there are,

902
00:56:48,731 --> 00:56:52,270
when I talk with filmmakers who
don't care about the mission,

903
00:56:53,290 --> 00:56:53,951
perhaps some do,

904
00:56:53,951 --> 00:56:57,040
but really it isn't their main motivation
to care about the mission of science

905
00:56:57,041 --> 00:56:57,874
education.

906
00:56:58,180 --> 00:57:01,810
But I can help them tell more interesting
stories and that gets people buying

907
00:57:01,811 --> 00:57:06,510
more tickets. So if, if
you, uh, reasonably, uh,

908
00:57:07,050 --> 00:57:09,940
uh, uh, uh, well,

909
00:57:09,941 --> 00:57:13,600
sort of cognizant people about how,
how the universe works,

910
00:57:13,601 --> 00:57:17,320
go into a movie and you can see they've
done a sloppy job of making the whole

911
00:57:17,321 --> 00:57:21,650
story believable because the
world building is problematic, um,

912
00:57:21,850 --> 00:57:23,730
it pops you out of the movie.
You,

913
00:57:23,770 --> 00:57:28,410
you're probably not going to
go see it three times. Like,
you know, like, like you,

914
00:57:28,411 --> 00:57:31,600
you, you, you may, uh, if, if, if
you really sort of engaged with it.

915
00:57:31,601 --> 00:57:35,440
So even though they might be people
with magic flying hammers and you know,

916
00:57:36,730 --> 00:57:41,680
doing all sorts of crazy things,
if it has the feeling of, of,

917
00:57:41,770 --> 00:57:46,160
of a, of at least for the two
hours that you're in the movie of,

918
00:57:46,170 --> 00:57:49,960
of feeling like it's a
scientifically coherent world,

919
00:57:50,050 --> 00:57:53,770
even though it's not
our world, um, then, uh,

920
00:57:53,771 --> 00:57:56,380
you're telling a better story and,
and uh,

921
00:57:56,430 --> 00:58:01,430
and who better to ask about how to build
universes and rules for universes than

922
00:58:01,931 --> 00:58:06,430
people who study this universe and study
its rules. So, so, so that, that's,

923
00:58:06,460 --> 00:58:11,170
that's sort of the, the job I think I can,
I can do if they let me, unfortunately,

924
00:58:11,500 --> 00:58:15,160
most of Hollywood still hasn't
realized that last part. Um,

925
00:58:15,161 --> 00:58:19,190
so it's still fairly random as
to how much they let me, uh,

926
00:58:19,210 --> 00:58:21,520
get involved in those projects.
But when they do,

927
00:58:21,521 --> 00:58:23,230
I can usually give them some fun stuff.

928
00:58:25,390 --> 00:58:26,610
We are running out of time.
