1
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:06,740
I need you

2
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:14,110
to speak before this audience. So, uh,

3
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:18,240
I guess the last week there has been
lots of talk about opinion polls.

4
00:00:18,241 --> 00:00:19,890
And a funny,

5
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:25,170
surprisingly this time the exit
polls were on the dot. I almost, so,

6
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:28,020
uh, they kind of made up a
little bit for the messaging,

7
00:00:28,021 --> 00:00:31,470
the big Zit to opinion polls. Well, uh,

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I said I've been doing this for over about
two decades in India and I give talks

9
00:00:38,041 --> 00:00:39,930
on this and,
uh,

10
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:44,670
using the talks are sometimes on the
television show as well. Uh, people say,

11
00:00:44,671 --> 00:00:49,050
how can talking to 1200 waters tell you
anything about what happens to the whole

12
00:00:49,051 --> 00:00:52,680
population? Uh, so, uh,

13
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:56,640
when did I picked up?
That's the typical size.

14
00:00:56,641 --> 00:01:01,641
I saw all of the pools in UK in India
use really have favorable 6,000 for a

15
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:02,970
state election.

16
00:01:02,971 --> 00:01:06,570
And maybe you went 20,000 for a national
election because you're a lot of

17
00:01:06,571 --> 00:01:10,500
diversity, but still, uh,
then the population is,

18
00:01:10,501 --> 00:01:13,830
are the number of voters is
also 700 million. And, uh,

19
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:18,720
this question still remains, how can
talking to such a small proportion,

20
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:24,020
uh, give you any insight into the
whole, uh, population. Uh, in dooly,

21
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:28,300
everybody thinks about the
proportion sample size versus
the population size and,

22
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:31,200
uh,
the least,

23
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:35,340
one of the tasks of convincing you
is that that's not important. Uh,

24
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:39,600
that's one of the tasks.
The other thing which I'll talk about,

25
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,190
everybody has an opinion on that,

26
00:01:41,191 --> 00:01:45,300
but can open in polls conducted say a
week before the actual pool accurately

27
00:01:45,301 --> 00:01:48,750
predict outcome we saw here,
uh,

28
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:52,530
the recent poll while the exit polls
got it right, even a one week earlier,

29
00:01:52,531 --> 00:01:56,100
they're still seeing a comfortable
victory for conservatives.

30
00:01:56,970 --> 00:02:00,480
So there are occasions when they can, and
there are occasions when they will not.

31
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:05,230
So we'll talk about that. Of course. Uh,

32
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:08,550
the whole thing is a, as a probability
statistics background. And, uh,

33
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:13,310
this slide a deliberately, I've kept it
blank is it doesn't mean no, but Magnolia,

34
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:17,970
Munich. But, uh, we'll do
it live. What background is
needed? So what I have with me,

35
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:23,280
it's just a cardboard box and what
it has our hundred slips of paper.

36
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:26,340
Okay.
I didn't tickle in all aspects and uh,

37
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:29,790
each one has a letter written on it,
either a or a B.

38
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:32,130
So you trust me on that.

39
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:36,590
And then I mixed them thoroughly and uh,

40
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,380
come to the audience and someone
whom I have never met before,

41
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:44,350
I asked you to pick up one. You can pick
from the top, bottom anywhere. Okay.

42
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:46,260
All right.
Can you read it out and

43
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:52,590
eat? So you, uh,

44
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:56,340
you believe that we have not
fixed this a event and uh,

45
00:02:56,610 --> 00:03:01,090
one was drawn out of this box
after and that one led an eight.

46
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:05,200
Now, uh, it's just based
on this information.

47
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:08,830
If you were to make a call, uh, oh,

48
00:03:08,831 --> 00:03:12,760
I forgot to say that there are 99 of them
which have one letter and exactly one

49
00:03:12,761 --> 00:03:16,990
which is the outlier. Okay. So
there we are only two possibilities.

50
00:03:16,991 --> 00:03:20,620
99 A's and one B or 99 B's and one eight.

51
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:25,870
Just based on this observation that it
was a one was drawn out after mixing,

52
00:03:25,871 --> 00:03:27,460
etc. Etc.
And that was a a,

53
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:30,340
if you're to make a guess
between the two possibilities,

54
00:03:30,341 --> 00:03:34,710
which is the likely possibility,
99, eight one B on 99 [inaudible]

55
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:39,340
99 eight.
So

56
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:44,530
a few people answered, others may have
made up their mind but didn't answer.

57
00:03:44,531 --> 00:03:45,850
But uh,

58
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:50,800
if one tries to go at the background as
to what went in your mind when you pick

59
00:03:50,801 --> 00:03:53,830
this all alternative, of course the
simplest explanation is just common sense.

60
00:03:53,831 --> 00:03:56,320
What is there. Okay. Uh,

61
00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:59,950
people who have had some statistics
background or profitability background may

62
00:03:59,951 --> 00:04:04,951
compute probabilities of the two scenarios
and compare them even a sold on the

63
00:04:05,291 --> 00:04:07,840
base in technology, uh, philosophy,

64
00:04:07,841 --> 00:04:12,841
they would computer put a prior and
computer posterior and say that the

65
00:04:12,851 --> 00:04:17,140
posterior probability of getting
it, this, this right is 99%.

66
00:04:17,141 --> 00:04:21,340
So they'll go with the whichever
one turned up is your answer. Right?

67
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:27,640
So, uh, now let's say,

68
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:30,010
let's do a thought experiment.
I don't have another box,

69
00:04:30,011 --> 00:04:34,660
but let's do a thought experiment
that instead of 99 one,

70
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:40,300
we had 95, five. Okay.
So one letter is 95,

71
00:04:40,301 --> 00:04:42,850
another letter is five
and they are all mixed up.

72
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:47,650
And let's say I go to one person, you
drought, read it out, put it back,

73
00:04:47,651 --> 00:04:50,200
we shake it up again. I come to
the second, I come to the third.

74
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:55,360
This time you will have three
observations. Okay. And we can still go.

75
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:59,800
They all could be same or we could
have two of one and one of the other.

76
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:05,020
That's why I didn't pick from one
to two, but three, no ties. Okay?

77
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:10,000
So we can talk about, go with the
majority rules with three. Okay.

78
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:13,720
And here is a slide which

79
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:18,010
convince us that uh,

80
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:26,490
the chances of in their certain loosens
chances of getting it right or again,

81
00:05:27,251 --> 00:05:31,540
nine over 99%. So the first one is, uh,

82
00:05:31,541 --> 00:05:36,010
all three are the same or two. Our of
the dominant one and one is the outlier.

83
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:39,820
Okay? So that's the possibilities. And

84
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:45,820
uh, so by repeating
the draws, three draws,

85
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:49,450
we have increased our
precision in a loose sense.

86
00:05:49,451 --> 00:05:51,190
Precision earlier was 99%.

87
00:05:51,191 --> 00:05:55,030
Now if you'd draw once
it is 95 by three draws,

88
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:58,720
we have improved the precision
to 90% and [inaudible]

89
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:01,163
uh,

90
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:05,670
does, you can still go with this
kind of a rule. Go with the majority

91
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:11,550
out of three.
Now if the gap is lesser,

92
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:16,730
we can experiment and come up with what
number is needed to reach 99% precision.

93
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:22,090
Okay. Uh, and uh,

94
00:06:22,091 --> 00:06:26,040
I'll display the numbers. What
kind of a scaling up happens. Okay?

95
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:30,270
But, uh, let's do another
thought experiment.

96
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:35,070
Instead of hundreds slips, they are
a bigger box and a thousand slips.

97
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:36,323
Okay?

98
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:44,390
And once I get 95% with one
letter and 50 of 55% other ones,

99
00:06:44,751 --> 00:06:48,540
a 95, you have one letter,
95% have one letter,

100
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:51,120
one 5% has the other.
So nine 50 and 50.

101
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:55,560
So 2009 50 50 is the breakup.
And this time, again,

102
00:06:55,960 --> 00:07:00,960
we want to get an accuracy level of 99%.

103
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:06,120
So with hundred and 95,
five we saw it was three draws.

104
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:09,030
So how would it scale up?

105
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:13,560
Do we need three draws
your or do we need 30?

106
00:07:13,561 --> 00:07:17,860
So does it scale up like multiplier or
does it scale up like square root as some

107
00:07:17,861 --> 00:07:19,700
various things in statistics scale up?

108
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,930
What is the factor of
Scallop is the question?

109
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:26,880
The answer to this is
rather counter intuitive.

110
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:32,250
Just look at these two equations.

111
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:37,700
First one was 400 flips with 95 five
second one is 4,000 slips with nine 50 and

112
00:07:38,971 --> 00:07:42,930
50.
And of course the second one,

113
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:45,580
there's just a factor of 10 in each,
uh,

114
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:48,870
factor in each term and
they would cancel out.

115
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:55,200
So, uh, with even if we are
thousand slips with nine 50,

116
00:07:55,201 --> 00:07:56,160
50 distribution,

117
00:07:56,161 --> 00:08:01,161
if we draw a three and go
with the majority are accuracy
level is still over 99%

118
00:08:02,401 --> 00:08:07,200
precision is still owed 99%
and more in need, it scales up.

119
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:11,700
It could be anything. Instead of
thousand it would have been 100,000,

120
00:08:11,701 --> 00:08:13,650
it could have been a million,
whatever.

121
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:19,100
If the distribution is 95% and 5%
we draw three go with the majority.

122
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:21,120
Precision is 99.

123
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:27,650
So this is somewhat counterintuitive
that it is the number of draws and not

124
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:34,710
total how many slips. Okay.
That besides the precision.

125
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:38,133
Uh,

126
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:44,570
so I just read an equation. We don't
have to read that, but if you have a,

127
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:45,840
if he'd died down,

128
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:49,330
the w is the support for when I'm
just saying a two party contest,

129
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:53,690
one constituency. We don't even need
to know the constitution, the size, uh,

130
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:58,730
and to candidates w percent support for
the winner and hundred minus w for the

131
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:02,760
loser. Okay. Uh,

132
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:08,290
we'd draw a odd number of
draws and accuracy of the rule.

133
00:09:08,641 --> 00:09:12,600
Go with the winner in the sample is
this expression interesting thing.

134
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:16,220
This expression doesn't request population
say August size of the constituency,

135
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:17,850
number of voters in the constituency.

136
00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:19,963
And

137
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:23,963
this is,

138
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:29,330
this is what is at the back of people
when the population size to somehow enter

139
00:09:29,611 --> 00:09:32,670
the picture when you want precision.
That's why they say that. You know,

140
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:36,150
why so many, just the swimming out
of so many. How can you say anything?

141
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:39,490
Okay,
so

142
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:41,370
that's it.

143
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:46,370
[inaudible] now here is this a table
which I've computed that especially on the

144
00:09:46,921 --> 00:09:51,090
previous slide I've just
computed explicitly, uh, far.

145
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:53,953
Uh,

146
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:58,950
so the column header is number
of draws a spelling mistake.

147
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:03,870
So column header is the number of draws.
Uh,

148
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:07,540
and the, the role harder is the
percentage of support for the winner.

149
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:12,560
So 51 is like very touch and go very
close election and 53 54 is a comfortable

150
00:10:13,861 --> 00:10:16,370
election.
So when it's comfortable,

151
00:10:16,371 --> 00:10:19,050
you won a 54%,

152
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:22,200
you went to how and then one,
if,

153
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:27,240
so this day equivalent of draw is going
to waters and seeking their opinion.

154
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:33,100
So, uh, if it's a comfortable
victory margin, uh,

155
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:38,120
then even work the thousand people and
getting their opinion should give you an

156
00:10:38,341 --> 00:10:41,460
insight into what is likely to happen.
Uh,

157
00:10:41,461 --> 00:10:46,461
99.4% accuracy exactly the same logic
as the experiment of drawing one sleep,

158
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:48,540
nothing more,
nothing less.

159
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:52,481
In fact,

160
00:10:52,481 --> 00:10:56,050
we can you imagine that we draw a night
out slips with all possibilities of

161
00:10:56,051 --> 00:10:59,170
thousand voters from that
constitutes put them in a box,

162
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:02,680
shake it up and take it out. We don't
have to do it as a thought experiment.

163
00:11:02,681 --> 00:11:03,580
That's exactly what

164
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:06,230
it is.
And

165
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:11,260
you went 52%,
a 52 48,

166
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:16,300
five zero one five should
suffice to get good procedure.

167
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:18,090
Yeah.

168
00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:19,180
So,
uh,

169
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:24,393
okay.

170
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:26,590
So another way of putting it is a

171
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:32,230
where did I'm willing to do a poll
in UK or in India where India,

172
00:11:32,231 --> 00:11:35,920
that voters are at least 10
times more if not 10 times more,

173
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:40,080
uh, for a given procedure. And
I need the same sample face,

174
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,560
something which is very difficult
to sell it to media houses. I mean,

175
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:49,030
we do it for media houses in India and
we do it for the whole country as well as

176
00:11:49,031 --> 00:11:52,520
for individual states. And they
would say half or the whole country.

177
00:11:52,521 --> 00:11:53,410
We had forward budget.

178
00:11:53,411 --> 00:11:56,050
Now this state is less than a
10th of the whole population.

179
00:11:56,051 --> 00:11:59,860
Our budgets slashed by 10% slash two 10%.

180
00:11:59,861 --> 00:12:02,500
And we have to deliver,
no, no, no, no, no. I mean,

181
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:04,780
of course they're not
going to buy this match.

182
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:11,980
So that's a tough task. But uh,

183
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:19,420
okay. Uh, one uh,

184
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,530
one correction in a sense that,
uh,

185
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:27,910
while in this experiment I could take,
when we are drying three,

186
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:31,360
we'll roll one slip, we put it back, shake
it up again, go to the second person,

187
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:35,360
put it back, shake and so on.
So this is v three placements.

188
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:37,000
So once you're taking it out,
you're replaced.

189
00:12:37,010 --> 00:12:39,100
It in fact is you are
never going to do that.

190
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:44,890
You can't be going to the
same person thing. Oh your
name up. You're in my sample.

191
00:12:44,891 --> 00:12:49,660
So you know I last you two times whether
face to face or by phone. That's stupid.

192
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:50,830
So,
uh,

193
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:54,460
in practice what is implemented is what
is called sampling without replacement.

194
00:12:54,461 --> 00:12:57,160
So you take out one slip,
keep it aside,

195
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:59,590
and then go to the next
and take it out of that.

196
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:03,910
It's makes very little difference.
If anything,

197
00:13:03,911 --> 00:13:07,840
he don't leave improves this table,
this accuracy of prediction.

198
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:10,600
If you live without replacement,
if anything, you don't leave Bruce.

199
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:15,910
As we can see if the tutor population
was only two five zero one and we do

200
00:13:15,911 --> 00:13:18,580
without replacement,
then at 25,

201
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:23,140
two five zero and we'll get the exact
answer no matter what is the proportion.

202
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:28,360
So, uh, if the sample is a much
larger proportion of the population,

203
00:13:28,361 --> 00:13:31,330
then the numbers change but only upwards.

204
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:35,950
And when the sample is like 1%
or less than these other numbers,

205
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:41,560
even in practice. So this is less than
one challenges me that uh, you know,

206
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:44,110
it does make a difference.
The population size,

207
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:47,710
it makes a difference in practice
because we do without replacement.

208
00:13:47,711 --> 00:13:49,450
And even then,
uh,

209
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:53,830
when the samples collected is less than
1% of the population. This is the table.

210
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:56,303
Okay?

211
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:58,770
Okay. So the, uh,

212
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:02,360
then is how do we select this?

213
00:14:02,361 --> 00:14:06,110
A 1001 or two,
five zero one.

214
00:14:06,770 --> 00:14:10,680
Respondence. So what we do should
correspond to in some sense,

215
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:14,930
writing out all possible list of
that size, putting it in a big box,

216
00:14:14,931 --> 00:14:18,470
shaking it up, and then drawing one. Okay.

217
00:14:18,950 --> 00:14:23,060
If you don't do that, we may get, we
may not get the right answer. Okay?

218
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:25,280
So for example,
if you were to pick,

219
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:30,281
say [inaudible] people last week we
had to do something about London city.

220
00:14:30,401 --> 00:14:35,330
It's a lot, all of you, but how are
the voters in London doing? Okay?

221
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:39,600
If someone said, okay, I'll just come
and stand at a Google office in pen, uh,

222
00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:43,120
fix Pierre's office and first
thousand people who enter,

223
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:47,510
I just get their opinion.
Okay. Got a sample of 5,000,

224
00:14:48,310 --> 00:14:49,760
uh, would that, do

225
00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:54,950
you want to literally talk would tell
you that that would do, I mean, uh,

226
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:56,270
it's what would be a very,

227
00:14:56,271 --> 00:15:01,070
very biased sample of a certain social
economic profile, age group and Econ,

228
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:04,250
socioeconomic profile.
Everybody has something to do with Google.

229
00:15:04,251 --> 00:15:06,770
Most of them would be employed
and fuel could be visitors,

230
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:10,850
but there's something to do with Google
and that already tells you a certain

231
00:15:10,851 --> 00:15:12,020
socioeconomic class.

232
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:16,640
And this would represent the opinion
of the entire city of London.

233
00:15:18,170 --> 00:15:19,003
So

234
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:23,990
how do we select these thousand people?
Uh,

235
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:27,140
is the crux of this whole
methodology or technology.

236
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:32,210
And part of the problem happens
is that in colloquial terms,

237
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:37,130
people equate the word random with
arbitrary. And if you say, no,

238
00:15:37,131 --> 00:15:41,450
no, we don't do well. Uh, what
is ram in our computer systems,

239
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:45,610
random access memory,
it is mistakenly call,

240
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:47,930
it should actually recall
arbitrary access memory.

241
00:15:47,931 --> 00:15:52,760
That was to differentiate it from linear
access memory as in old magnetic tapes

242
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:55,130
where you could only access it linearly.

243
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:58,310
They came up with this new thing
where you could address any,

244
00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:01,410
you could ask any address. So, uh,

245
00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:03,800
three days actually
arbitrary access memory,

246
00:16:03,801 --> 00:16:06,460
but it's got used to be
random access memory.

247
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:09,460
Now of course you'll need to call it rain.
We don't call it ran.

248
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:14,270
So this is just an example to say that
how these two things are confused in, uh,

249
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:18,020
somehow, uh, gender public's mind that,

250
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:21,620
so that's why the thing comes. It
just get some thousand people. No,

251
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,350
not some thousand people.
Uh,

252
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:28,730
so sometimes when I say this,
others argue with me,

253
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:32,750
what the first thousand people to enter
Google could be on one of the list.

254
00:16:32,751 --> 00:16:35,540
If you make all possible lists,
this would be one of the list.

255
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:39,090
How can you say this is not random sample?
Well,

256
00:16:39,091 --> 00:16:44,091
the answer to that is a random or not
is not a property of the group chosen is

257
00:16:44,981 --> 00:16:46,950
the property of the
method by which you chose.

258
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:52,870
If you're telling me this
group, I can't say that. No,

259
00:16:52,871 --> 00:16:55,090
this is not random because I
don't know how you have chosen it.

260
00:16:55,091 --> 00:16:56,440
If you're telling me how you chosen it,

261
00:16:56,740 --> 00:17:00,380
then I can make a world whether or
not it's a randomly chosen subgroup

262
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,920
subset. So, uh,

263
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:09,280
so especially on television, a
lot of, uh, fireworks with the,

264
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:13,280
especially from the representatives of
the parties when we are saying are going

265
00:17:13,281 --> 00:17:14,420
to lose,
uh,

266
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:19,250
are based on just this approach that
either sample size and this and I ended up

267
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:20,093
saying,

268
00:17:21,610 --> 00:17:22,443
okay,

269
00:17:23,090 --> 00:17:24,840
so, uh, that, uh,

270
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:28,760
the point is random sampling
is a must if you do it.

271
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:30,760
Uh,
no,

272
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,730
so I call it,
it's a must.

273
00:17:34,731 --> 00:17:38,310
If for the statistical guarantee that
the sample based prediction is accurate,

274
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:40,303
okay.

275
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:44,010
The choice of the sample should
have been chosen randomly

276
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,000
then,
uh,

277
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:50,010
now one could,
some shortcuts

278
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:54,450
are, one could make additional
requirements. Uh, for example, uh,

279
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:55,830
the,
uh,

280
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:59,640
if you know that there is a rural urban
divide or if you know that there's a

281
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:04,530
divide across economic strata, then, uh,

282
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:07,400
if you have a master database
where we can differentiate very,

283
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:11,580
we have data about, uh, age
groups, thought about, uh, uh,

284
00:18:11,610 --> 00:18:14,190
income levels, uh, education.

285
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:19,400
So one can create subgroups and the
desire that I want to recall stratas in

286
00:18:19,441 --> 00:18:22,260
statistics and for each strata,
we can pick them randomly.

287
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:25,830
The required number of,
but at the,

288
00:18:25,831 --> 00:18:28,950
so we can have a smarter strategy
is to get a better representation.

289
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:30,360
But final stage,

290
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:35,630
we have to have a random
choice in a ceratin way,

291
00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:38,610
uh,
done either just a random number.

292
00:18:38,611 --> 00:18:41,880
Do you have a list and you generate
randomly numbers and you'll pick those.

293
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:43,710
That's easiest thing to do.

294
00:18:43,711 --> 00:18:48,000
Now we don't have to make slips and
put them in a box. And so on so forth.

295
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:55,460
The, uh, implementing it, uh,

296
00:18:55,480 --> 00:19:00,380
varies from place to place. Uh, what
is possible, what is not possible.

297
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:04,910
So, uh, you, you can
understand and probably,

298
00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:08,930
and us also, I, it typically these days
it is done through a telephone survey.

299
00:19:09,530 --> 00:19:12,240
You randomly generate
telephone numbers and, uh,

300
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:14,810
you call up people and get their opinion.

301
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:17,130
Okay.

302
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:21,960
Now, uh, the sip, this methodology
is fine. Now in the Western world,

303
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:24,930
even in the Western world,
going back a few decades,

304
00:19:24,931 --> 00:19:29,400
this was not fine because the penetration
of telephones was not quite universal.

305
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:31,753
Okay?

306
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:36,630
In India, uh, is this
still not okay? Because a,

307
00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:39,390
the penetration in the lower
sections of the society,

308
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:41,460
socioeconomic classes
is still rather poor.

309
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:44,730
So anything done from
telephone surveys is good.

310
00:19:44,731 --> 00:19:48,950
Not going to represent
the entire population. Uh,

311
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:52,030
yeah.

312
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:56,180
Now, especially here,
people could say that,

313
00:19:56,270 --> 00:20:00,490
why go through this thing of calling
up people and so on, so forth.

314
00:20:00,491 --> 00:20:04,210
People are voluntarily pumping away
at a fast pace on social media.

315
00:20:04,211 --> 00:20:06,430
Just pick that data and uh,

316
00:20:06,490 --> 00:20:10,460
use that after all advertisers
have gone away from, uh,

317
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,300
doing market research in the
traditional way of sampling,

318
00:20:13,301 --> 00:20:15,280
but added going with
the social media buzz.

319
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:20,140
Why not elections is a
very valid question. Uh,

320
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:23,380
the answer to that is for elections,

321
00:20:23,381 --> 00:20:27,460
it won't do wildfire advertising
for mo several products.

322
00:20:27,461 --> 00:20:32,461
It does work because if you're trying
to address a market and that market is

323
00:20:32,981 --> 00:20:37,210
consist of people who are
active on social media, uh,

324
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:41,500
let's say somebody that advertising a
foreign company that advertising a very

325
00:20:41,501 --> 00:20:45,130
good deal for wifi connectivity,
white on the move, on the mobile,

326
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:47,170
only targeting the segment.

327
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:50,890
So for them it's enough to
get the social media buzz.

328
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:55,240
But in a election scenario ago,
uh,

329
00:20:55,241 --> 00:21:00,130
the day that differential usage across
socioeconomic economic classes and uh,

330
00:21:00,610 --> 00:21:04,330
if one goes by social media, uh,
one is likely to make errors.

331
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:09,970
So we had three years ago in one of
the high profile elections in India,

332
00:21:09,971 --> 00:21:12,190
yet looked at uh,

333
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:15,460
opinion poll based thing as
well as the social media buzz.

334
00:21:15,461 --> 00:21:16,960
We got to pick the winner correctly.

335
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:20,860
You based on social media buzz and a,

336
00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:23,410
the ultimate answer was
a hands down victory.

337
00:21:23,411 --> 00:21:26,830
What we would have had a much bigger
victory margin if you had gone with social

338
00:21:26,831 --> 00:21:29,530
media.
There was a buzz on one side.

339
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:36,490
So the uh, made me one more
time. One could do this,

340
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:39,280
but certainly even in the western world,

341
00:21:39,281 --> 00:21:43,000
I don't think they can take this
as one of the boots in the model,

342
00:21:43,330 --> 00:21:47,680
but the content entirely go
with the social media buzz
that will drive them away.

343
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:49,420
So,
uh,

344
00:21:55,030 --> 00:22:00,030
now let me come to another
very interesting question
on the surveys can do is to

345
00:22:00,851 --> 00:22:02,650
get estimate of what percentage,

346
00:22:02,651 --> 00:22:06,070
what percentage of people here we're
rooting for labor and what we're waiting

347
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:10,480
waiting for the Tories. And for
the rest, the smaller parties.

348
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:12,140
But uh,

349
00:22:12,141 --> 00:22:16,690
there's no magical formula which you
can input the word percentages for the

350
00:22:16,691 --> 00:22:21,640
parties and output would give you how
many seats because a lot depends on how

351
00:22:21,641 --> 00:22:26,390
these votes are distributed.
So,

352
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:30,740
uh, just measuring the total vote is
not good enough. On the other hand,

353
00:22:30,741 --> 00:22:34,010
if for every constituency you measure
votes, then that is good enough.

354
00:22:34,011 --> 00:22:37,280
But then that's the possible exercise.
Too expensive,

355
00:22:37,281 --> 00:22:40,670
too time consuming and
almost not doable or,

356
00:22:40,671 --> 00:22:43,700
or 600 constituencies on each one.
If you want the thousand,

357
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,010
that's a tough task.

358
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:52,010
Nobody would pay for that kind of a thing.
So that's not possible.

359
00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:55,190
So what do we do?
On one hand,

360
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:59,220
statistically you can measure
public opinion in terms
of overall what percentage

361
00:22:59,221 --> 00:23:02,960
is, but the interest for everyone, it
doesn't help me if I said no, no, no,

362
00:23:02,961 --> 00:23:05,660
my work is, to me it was right, but
the seats were wrong. What can I do?

363
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:09,770
People would not listen to me if
I'm wrong. Also the other way,

364
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:13,460
if somehow I make a waiter's
cancel each other out,

365
00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:16,960
our survey is wrong and my conversion is
also wrong. And eventually we get right.

366
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:21,320
If everybody public, I, I've got it right
because that is the objective function.

367
00:23:21,321 --> 00:23:24,290
We are looking at fits.
Uh,

368
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:28,880
you went in the u s a it's the electoral
college votes. Not Quite the votes,

369
00:23:28,881 --> 00:23:30,560
but uh,

370
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:34,550
in the system like you gate is winner
take all it a constituent filled level.

371
00:23:34,551 --> 00:23:38,840
Whoever gets the largest number of votes
gets that constituency representative

372
00:23:38,841 --> 00:23:43,120
is there parking in USA, the
consolidation happens at the state level.

373
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:47,120
Winner take all at the state
level. Uh, even if in the state,

374
00:23:47,121 --> 00:23:51,620
the one candidate in the head from ahead
of the other with just a few hundred

375
00:23:51,621 --> 00:23:56,450
votes, but they get the entire
state's electoral college votes.

376
00:23:56,510 --> 00:23:57,770
That's the system in us.

377
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:00,103
And

378
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:07,160
Buddhists do do this,
namely convert votes to seats.

379
00:24:07,210 --> 00:24:10,150
What we need is a kind of a
mathematical statistical model,

380
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:14,140
which would as a input taken into account
various things that we know about the

381
00:24:14,141 --> 00:24:14,974
ground reality.

382
00:24:16,350 --> 00:24:21,300
Uh,
the things like

383
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:24,140
how susceptible is the vote for change.

384
00:24:24,650 --> 00:24:28,560
They do are the volatility of public
opinion. Now, traditionally, uh,

385
00:24:28,670 --> 00:24:30,980
I had been hearing an admin tool.

386
00:24:30,981 --> 00:24:35,510
I used to interact quite a bit with one
project, Clive Bain, who used to do, uh,

387
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:39,510
who are the psephologists for BBC for
a long period professor in the field

388
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:40,393
college.

389
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:46,360
And he had told me that the volatility
of public opinion in UK is very small

390
00:24:47,090 --> 00:24:50,420
from one election. If you look
at from one election to the next,

391
00:24:50,421 --> 00:24:54,470
how many people change their world?
That's very small. Now that scenario,

392
00:24:54,471 --> 00:24:56,910
it looks like it has been changing,
uh,

393
00:24:57,150 --> 00:25:00,860
this tracking the opinion polls
over the last three weeks. Uh,

394
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:05,930
three weeks ago they had measured the gap
between the Conservatives and Labor to

395
00:25:05,931 --> 00:25:10,700
be, or 20%. And it came down to 2% or
1% when it came to the election time.

396
00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:13,970
So the,
uh,

397
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:20,560
traditionally they used to spend a lot
of effort on what they call the marginal

398
00:25:21,561 --> 00:25:24,530
seats and what was called fifth seats,

399
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:29,210
fifth for predicting where the last time
that gap was 7% or more when you can

400
00:25:29,211 --> 00:25:32,990
count. This wasn't last time.
We'll win again this time.

401
00:25:33,090 --> 00:25:37,230
Lot of such seats have
changed hands. So, uh,

402
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:43,040
the Martin had to take into account all
such things that one knows about the

403
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:45,830
video. Everyone is making. The prediction.

404
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:48,980
Other thing is what kind
of data is available.

405
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:54,100
One knows that socioeconomic
profile does matter when,

406
00:25:54,101 --> 00:25:56,890
when for voting intention,
uh,

407
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:59,600
overall and ventured balance across that,

408
00:25:59,930 --> 00:26:04,910
but at what level is the [inaudible]
profiles available. So, uh,

409
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:09,590
and you get their availability to
fairly detailed level and perhaps that

410
00:26:09,591 --> 00:26:12,440
precinct level, uh, in India,

411
00:26:12,490 --> 00:26:16,970
they are not available at
that level because it's
available at district level in

412
00:26:16,971 --> 00:26:19,670
India,
but not at the constituency level.

413
00:26:21,050 --> 00:26:25,490
So taking into account various such
reality is how susceptible is the vote for

414
00:26:25,491 --> 00:26:29,960
change, what kind of other data
auxiliary data is available, uh,

415
00:26:30,410 --> 00:26:35,090
taking into account all that, uh,
one built a statistical model and,

416
00:26:35,091 --> 00:26:39,200
uh, then uses that to, can
work votes to seats. And

417
00:26:41,210 --> 00:26:45,300
so this is where I come in actually
in our team in India where we do it,

418
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:48,780
the others do the actual
sampling and so on and so forth.

419
00:26:48,781 --> 00:26:53,610
And I come into the picture for
this work to see conversion. So,

420
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:57,630
indeed, if one looks at
the last us election, uh,

421
00:26:58,410 --> 00:27:02,880
everybody got it wrong, but they got
it wrong for, it was not the survey,

422
00:27:02,881 --> 00:27:05,820
we'd got it wrong. It was this word to
sit conversion where they go to Trump.

423
00:27:06,810 --> 00:27:10,770
Hillary Clinton did get
more votes than Trump,

424
00:27:10,771 --> 00:27:14,250
and then they'd been calling that the
gap has narrowed. But there was still,

425
00:27:14,251 --> 00:27:16,440
everybody was Gung Ho
about Hillary winning.

426
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:21,680
And what went wrong was what in
statistics would call their prior. So the,

427
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:25,540
like I talked about UK
in us too, they, uh,

428
00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:28,260
have classified the
states into three groups,

429
00:27:28,261 --> 00:27:33,120
a democratic Republican and a
swing states or marginal states.

430
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:37,320
And their entire effort was in looking
at what is happening in the marginal

431
00:27:37,321 --> 00:27:41,850
stage. They had classified, okay, these
20 or this 17 going the democratic basket,

432
00:27:41,851 --> 00:27:45,870
this 12 going the republican basket,
and then now let's focus on the rest.

433
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:50,970
It was this classification which went
wrong. Three of their democratic states,

434
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:54,350
I guess, Michigan,
Wisconsin, and one more, uh,

435
00:27:54,390 --> 00:27:57,030
which everybody believed
cannot go out of my Democrats.

436
00:27:57,031 --> 00:28:01,770
And they change sites by narrow margin.
And,

437
00:28:01,771 --> 00:28:06,220
uh, if they had not changed side, Hillary
would have been precedent. So the uh,

438
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:07,741
that's the other thing.

439
00:28:07,741 --> 00:28:10,950
How much weight do you give on your
prior and how much weight do you give on

440
00:28:10,951 --> 00:28:14,010
your data in any statistical thing?

441
00:28:14,011 --> 00:28:19,011
So they prior model all that is together
and then the data only data will not do

442
00:28:19,510 --> 00:28:24,180
because you need some other information
and it's a, so it's not just a science,

443
00:28:24,181 --> 00:28:27,300
it's a science and the art
you're to pick the right mix.

444
00:28:29,990 --> 00:28:30,490
Okay.

445
00:28:30,490 --> 00:28:31,780
So,
um,

446
00:28:32,910 --> 00:28:36,970
no I I people willing to answer questions

447
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:43,180
so I'm told that increasingly
the UK, us, the answer is no.

448
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:47,110
Only about 10% of phone calls that
they make end up getting them,

449
00:28:47,111 --> 00:28:51,550
getting the answers they want. Most others
just hang up as soon as they hear who,

450
00:28:51,670 --> 00:28:53,620
ah, okay. Okay. I know, I
know. And they'll put it down.

451
00:28:56,440 --> 00:29:01,440
Interestingly in India a while we do not
do a phone survey but actually do door

452
00:29:02,651 --> 00:29:05,200
to door survey lot more expensive.

453
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:08,950
But then refusal rate is very small.
Only about eight to 9%.

454
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:11,890
If you can find the person,
people are willing to talk.

455
00:29:12,910 --> 00:29:15,190
So telephone surveys much cheaper,

456
00:29:15,191 --> 00:29:18,430
but then there's this huge refusal rate
and then there are lots of questions

457
00:29:18,431 --> 00:29:23,431
about is there a systematic bias in being
introduced in refusal and non refuser

458
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:27,340
is it people, well, nothing
else to do, willing to answer.

459
00:29:27,341 --> 00:29:30,790
And people who are otherwise have some
meaningful stuff to do are refusing to

460
00:29:30,791 --> 00:29:35,650
answer. Right? So, uh,
these are questions but uh,

461
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:37,890
okay.

462
00:29:37,890 --> 00:29:41,800
But even when people are willing to
answer face to face, all the more,

463
00:29:41,801 --> 00:29:43,660
so they're very happy to answer.

464
00:29:43,661 --> 00:29:47,200
If you ask questions about how is the
PM doing or was this policy right,

465
00:29:47,201 --> 00:29:50,680
what that policy, right? Everybody
has an opinion and can do a lecture,

466
00:29:50,681 --> 00:29:55,090
not just answer of yes, no, but
at the end, if you asked, okay,

467
00:29:55,091 --> 00:29:59,730
so whom are you willing to vote tomorrow
or next week? Uh, answer is not going to,

468
00:29:59,790 --> 00:30:00,623
why should I tell you?

469
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:02,320
Okay.

470
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:06,490
Right. Because that's considered
a private information also.

471
00:30:06,970 --> 00:30:11,200
They don't know how you might
use it. So what we do is, uh,

472
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:14,980
we carry a box, something like
this, a bigger one with a slip.

473
00:30:15,030 --> 00:30:18,760
It's like the simulator,
old style ballot box with a slit.

474
00:30:19,030 --> 00:30:22,750
And all other questions are answered
face to face. This question,

475
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:24,400
whom are you willing to vote?
Voting intention.

476
00:30:24,401 --> 00:30:27,840
We give them a slip of paper
with the names you market,

477
00:30:27,850 --> 00:30:31,450
put it in a away market, bring
it back, fold it, put it in here.

478
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:32,800
People are willing to do that.

479
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:34,490
Yeah.

480
00:30:34,490 --> 00:30:37,370
So there's also what is
acceptable to people.

481
00:30:38,550 --> 00:30:38,970
Okay.

482
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:43,560
So it's a mix of various such things.
Understanding ground realities,

483
00:30:43,561 --> 00:30:46,860
psychology of uh,
that the population,

484
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:50,130
all that goes into planning
and doing the surgery

485
00:30:53,150 --> 00:30:55,070
next to the Duke.
People tell the truth.

486
00:30:56,670 --> 00:30:56,920
Yeah.

487
00:30:56,920 --> 00:31:01,840
And this is where there's a
lot of debate. Uh, in fact,

488
00:31:01,930 --> 00:31:06,370
uh, some, uh, people who do surveys
to believe that in any case,

489
00:31:06,371 --> 00:31:09,400
people either may not answer the direct
question, who are you going to vote?

490
00:31:09,670 --> 00:31:12,610
Or even when the answer
we'd it meant be unreliable.

491
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:17,470
So then what they do is they impute award
based on answers to other questions.

492
00:31:17,650 --> 00:31:21,560
For example, in Uk, this election
they could have had, do you think,

493
00:31:21,730 --> 00:31:23,440
are you in favor of Brexit or not?

494
00:31:23,441 --> 00:31:26,290
That would have been one of the questions
plus various other questions or 10

495
00:31:26,291 --> 00:31:28,840
questions.
And based on that answer,

496
00:31:28,870 --> 00:31:33,420
you build a model to decide whether this
respondent is likely to vote Labour or

497
00:31:33,430 --> 00:31:36,730
likely to work a of eight here.
So that's one approach.

498
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:39,953
Yeah.

499
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:44,790
In India with a much larger
proportion being illiterate, uh,

500
00:31:44,791 --> 00:31:48,330
this approach is unlikely to work.
Uh,

501
00:31:48,570 --> 00:31:50,070
the afraid to experiment with.

502
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:54,510
We do ask questions and we do ask a
direct question and then try to correlate

503
00:31:54,511 --> 00:31:59,280
and try to see if some patterns we can
find a no, it's not going to work there.

504
00:31:59,610 --> 00:32:02,340
It might well be working
in the west. So, uh,

505
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:04,950
not everybody follows
this imputing methodology,

506
00:32:04,951 --> 00:32:09,560
but there are serious researchers are
very searchers who do this that they asked

507
00:32:09,561 --> 00:32:13,230
10 questions, 10 questions and
impute a vote based on that.

508
00:32:17,850 --> 00:32:22,630
So my, my actual experience with data
is only limited to India. It's not a,

509
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:23,641
for UK,

510
00:32:23,641 --> 00:32:27,300
my interaction was limited to interactions
with project life and that was also

511
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:28,740
nearly 18 years ago.

512
00:32:29,890 --> 00:32:32,770
So,
uh,

513
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:37,870
another technique which is used
by some researchers is, uh,

514
00:32:38,230 --> 00:32:42,440
using last food recalled to correct for
bias. So along with other questions,

515
00:32:42,441 --> 00:32:47,320
you also ask, okay, how did you work last
time? They were the elections. So, uh,

516
00:32:47,790 --> 00:32:50,520
and the idea is that if you see that,
uh,

517
00:32:50,630 --> 00:32:55,630
let's say in your sample
you are overestimating
conservative would by 3% for the

518
00:32:55,701 --> 00:32:59,300
last four, three call. That means
in spite of whatever you're trying,

519
00:32:59,330 --> 00:33:03,380
you have somehow got to buy a sample
and you correct for the same by applying

520
00:33:03,381 --> 00:33:05,570
this correction. So you scale down, uh,

521
00:33:05,571 --> 00:33:07,940
the conservative vote by
corresponding percentages,

522
00:33:07,941 --> 00:33:12,920
editing or multiplicating you can do
that and scale of the labor work. So,

523
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:13,340
uh,

524
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:18,340
this is one common technique
used by researchers and
once again in India when we

525
00:33:19,041 --> 00:33:20,030
tried to do this,

526
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:24,470
we are driven far away
from the reality and again,

527
00:33:24,471 --> 00:33:25,790
something to do with psychology.

528
00:33:26,330 --> 00:33:31,070
So there seems to be a tendency in India
to identify with the winner. So, uh,

529
00:33:31,990 --> 00:33:36,830
so, so even even when they
are very unhappy with the
government and our voting it

530
00:33:36,831 --> 00:33:40,030
out, much larger proportion of
people seem to remember that the,

531
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:42,410
I don't want them now,
but five years ago I voted for them.

532
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:46,790
So we have found this
invariant of space and time.

533
00:33:46,791 --> 00:33:50,310
Whoever was the winner last time seems
to have much larger recall in vote.

534
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:54,470
And uh, so we, we do
not do that. So again,

535
00:33:54,471 --> 00:33:58,820
it is to do with understanding the
psychology of the nation to which one is

536
00:33:58,821 --> 00:34:02,750
doing this. How do people
behave collectively? So,

537
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:06,020
so I have a favorite phrase which I use.

538
00:34:06,021 --> 00:34:09,310
So electrons spinning the same way
in India is this do with vendors,

539
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:11,150
but human minds when can't stay the same.

540
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:14,600
So anything which is a physical phenomena,
uh,

541
00:34:14,601 --> 00:34:19,100
one could use some model where Ted in
the West just implanted in there and it

542
00:34:19,101 --> 00:34:23,060
will work. But when the phenomena
involves public interaction,

543
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:25,400
human choices being made by humans,

544
00:34:26,510 --> 00:34:29,540
that could address me a starting point
and one needs to fine tune the model.

545
00:34:30,870 --> 00:34:32,950
So,
Huh.

546
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:37,110
Okay. The last one, uh,

547
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:40,410
as we saw in UK itself recently,

548
00:34:40,411 --> 00:34:44,370
the predictive power of a poll
done weeks ahead is not much good.

549
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:47,730
They use probably similar
methodology and exit polls.

550
00:34:47,731 --> 00:34:51,780
They came out with the right numbers.
And so when there is a shifting opinion,

551
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:55,040
clearly have an opinion poll can address,

552
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:58,080
tell you what is the mood of the nation.
At the time the vote is taken,

553
00:34:58,890 --> 00:35:03,810
it can not predict how it might
evolve in the last week. Uh,

554
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:08,690
so you know, uh, fluid situation
where the public opinion is,

555
00:35:08,691 --> 00:35:13,620
uh, changing, uh, you can't
quite trust a bolden ahead.

556
00:35:13,830 --> 00:35:18,830
There's another factor which probably
played important role in a UK in recent

557
00:35:19,021 --> 00:35:20,580
one,
the

558
00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:22,770
okay

559
00:35:22,770 --> 00:35:26,640
bolden a week ahead or a month ahead.
Invariably of the whole population.

560
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:31,980
Now the pollsters couldn't
use their assumption, okay,
this is the overall group,

561
00:35:32,190 --> 00:35:32,880
this word,

562
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:36,750
this group is unlikely to go and would
only 60% of this group will go and vote

563
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:41,550
this group, 80%. Gwen would apply those
factors and then take it together. Okay.

564
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,380
But that's only a guess work.

565
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:48,210
And presumably they may have done
that in UK in the pre election polls.

566
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:53,340
And uh, this time again reading
newspaper reports, I have no other input.

567
00:35:53,810 --> 00:35:58,020
A younger voters turned up as much larger
proportion this time around than they

568
00:35:58,021 --> 00:36:02,470
were traditionally hooting.
And that could explain that for the,

569
00:36:02,471 --> 00:36:06,300
in the exit poll, they don't need to
apply such imputed percentage of votes.

570
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:10,320
They actually sample from the people
who have come to work and they therefore

571
00:36:10,321 --> 00:36:13,950
cogness effect of younger people turning
up in larger proportion than ever

572
00:36:13,951 --> 00:36:16,710
before. And that's how they
get got a better result.

573
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:20,640
So the predictive power of Paul
is a question mark on two counts.

574
00:36:20,641 --> 00:36:24,420
One the opinion itself maybe
changing and to address,

575
00:36:24,421 --> 00:36:27,400
you can be making a guesswork about
who is going to turn up to work.

576
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:29,220
You don't really know
who is going to work.

577
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:32,130
So that is what raises a question mark.

578
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:34,960
Okay.

579
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,820
So I guess let me stop

580
00:36:39,390 --> 00:36:40,223
questions.

581
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:51,830
So you were saying that a in India
pulling through telephone doesn't work

582
00:36:51,831 --> 00:36:55,550
whereas a new k. Dot. It tends to
work. But I was wondering in Uk,

583
00:36:55,551 --> 00:36:58,760
I think a lot of young people are not
really using home telephones these days.

584
00:36:58,940 --> 00:37:01,820
So they're using most mobile phones and
a lot of my friends that don't have time

585
00:37:01,821 --> 00:37:03,350
to do you think that is representative?

586
00:37:03,950 --> 00:37:06,260
Yeah, so I suppose I don't
know what they're doing,

587
00:37:06,261 --> 00:37:10,690
but perhaps they are trying to somehow
factoring this into account in there

588
00:37:10,730 --> 00:37:13,580
pulling method and maybe
also calling mobile numbers.

589
00:37:13,581 --> 00:37:15,500
I really don't know what they're doing.
But yes,

590
00:37:15,501 --> 00:37:17,360
if the old lipstick per landline numbers,

591
00:37:17,361 --> 00:37:22,220
they are going to miss out
the younger group. Completely
a point. Very well taken.

592
00:37:26,690 --> 00:37:31,370
Have you looked into the question of
what a public making the opinion polls

593
00:37:31,371 --> 00:37:35,090
public can actually influence the
results for like tactical voting?

594
00:37:35,270 --> 00:37:40,190
Yeah. Okay. Uh, so, uh, at
least based on India experience,

595
00:37:40,191 --> 00:37:44,000
I do believe that there is a feedback loop
and it does impact a tactical routine.

596
00:37:44,870 --> 00:37:45,800
And,
uh,

597
00:37:47,930 --> 00:37:51,620
again it is to do with this what I call
the psychology of going with the winner.

598
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:57,220
So whoever the media is saying is winning
a ends up actually increasing the,

599
00:37:58,140 --> 00:38:00,470
uh,
the gap typically.

600
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:05,630
So that's indirect evidence that uh,
it does have a feedback loop.

601
00:38:06,370 --> 00:38:10,580
Uh, but, uh, some people ask me
then why are you associated with it?

602
00:38:12,170 --> 00:38:15,920
But, uh, when others are working,
whether I knew it or not,

603
00:38:15,921 --> 00:38:17,270
others are going to do it in any way.

604
00:38:17,271 --> 00:38:21,260
So it's good a proper methodological
police done and released.

605
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:24,800
That's my answer to that. Yes. But it
does have a feedback loop. I don't know.

606
00:38:24,801 --> 00:38:25,790
Again, west, what is it?

607
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,233
Belief

608
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:31,293
isn't,

609
00:38:31,870 --> 00:38:36,570
so what capability does
a company like have to,

610
00:38:36,690 --> 00:38:40,390
to address this problem? Because
my, my understanding is, you know,

611
00:38:40,391 --> 00:38:44,170
they gather so much data on their users
and they actually have a very good

612
00:38:44,171 --> 00:38:47,890
understanding of the political
preferences of, of most of them.

613
00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:53,250
So as a company like Facebook actually
in a position just to kind of replace a

614
00:38:55,510 --> 00:38:56,920
sample polling

615
00:38:57,720 --> 00:39:00,590
maybe a water of time when they
then it becomes more universal.

616
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:05,550
But at this point, uh, I think
not because, uh, it, it really,

617
00:39:05,551 --> 00:39:09,600
it can capture the opinion
of the users that it has had,

618
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:13,320
but the lower socioeconomic strata who,

619
00:39:13,590 --> 00:39:17,040
even though they may be using
a mobile or be on Facebook, uh,

620
00:39:17,070 --> 00:39:21,180
that group will be
completely missed. So, uh,

621
00:39:23,010 --> 00:39:26,370
I think, uh, they said if your mark,

622
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:31,140
you are using this for
marketing some product, which
anyways, that segment, great,

623
00:39:31,141 --> 00:39:34,830
that's big inflammation.
But for something like elections,

624
00:39:35,190 --> 00:39:38,970
but African has to wait maybe
another few decades and uh,

625
00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:43,290
it might become almost to new
earth then maybe are not Facebook,

626
00:39:43,291 --> 00:39:46,590
something else may come up.
But social media more generally.

627
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:52,200
So, so my question is about the
sample size, a dependence on the,

628
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:54,660
on the uh,
percentages.

629
00:39:54,930 --> 00:39:57,930
So as you said that it is
relatively independent sample size.

630
00:39:57,931 --> 00:40:01,830
You need for the given prediction
accuracy you is independent of the total

631
00:40:01,831 --> 00:40:02,670
population size.

632
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:07,710
But I'm sure that it depends a bit
more strongly on the number of choices.

633
00:40:08,790 --> 00:40:10,740
Uh, so like number of, uh,

634
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:14,520
our possibilities by not
binomial but multinomial yeah,

635
00:40:14,750 --> 00:40:17,930
actually no,
even that it doesn't depend what it,

636
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:21,050
it depends a lot on for
the country as a whole.

637
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:24,140
It depends on how much is
the diversity as a whole.

638
00:40:25,030 --> 00:40:28,630
Right. So are you saying that for example,
if there was not just two parties,

639
00:40:28,631 --> 00:40:32,140
but like in India later listen,
30 parties, right? So the choice,

640
00:40:32,230 --> 00:40:36,060
the choice that you have to make is
between which of these 30 parties is going

641
00:40:36,061 --> 00:40:37,330
to win.
Um,

642
00:40:37,331 --> 00:40:40,560
so you're saying that the size that I
need does not actually depend on what they

643
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:44,730
started, two or 300. That
seems more counter intuitive.

644
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:53,360
But for vote to seat conversion
is a homogeneous country or is it,

645
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:54,960
so in India for example,

646
00:40:54,990 --> 00:40:58,530
each state has a kind of a different
political structure and uh,

647
00:40:58,890 --> 00:41:01,830
so we don't read the country as a whole.
We are predicting,

648
00:41:01,831 --> 00:41:04,380
we look at each state at least
the largest state as a whole.

649
00:41:04,381 --> 00:41:08,340
And so I need a reasonable sample size
at that state level because how people in

650
00:41:08,341 --> 00:41:11,600
the deep South I will not
award has nothing to do with
what people in the east,

651
00:41:11,601 --> 00:41:13,380
in Bengal. Uh, our thinking.

652
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:17,970
It's a complete disconnect at
least politically. And therefore,

653
00:41:18,270 --> 00:41:19,980
uh,
so in that sense,

654
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:23,420
I do need to do a poll at each state,

655
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:26,520
not just getting a nationwide thing
might give me what percentage,

656
00:41:26,521 --> 00:41:29,310
but it will not tell me at all
for my word proceed conversion.

657
00:41:29,311 --> 00:41:31,830
So for what to see conversion,
I do need a larger,

658
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:34,320
but number of parties doesn't mess up.

659
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:37,400
There must be a defendant,
sorry. Yep, Yep,

660
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:43,333
Yep.

661
00:41:43,470 --> 00:41:47,160
Because if you consider the limiting
case of the number of choices being

662
00:41:47,161 --> 00:41:50,070
actually larger than the
population right now,

663
00:41:50,071 --> 00:41:53,400
10 days of the pigeon hole principal
will say basically that you actually need

664
00:41:53,401 --> 00:41:54,430
to hold everybody.

665
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:58,600
Uh, when I said does it
depend, you're still talking
in terms of, you know, small,

666
00:41:58,601 --> 00:42:02,000
factual talking off a
million times. Yes, exactly.

667
00:42:02,630 --> 00:42:06,340
To answer your question, once again,
what estimated doesn't change,

668
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:08,820
but from vote to seat,
if the direct contacts,

669
00:42:08,830 --> 00:42:11,920
it's much easier when it's a
three way contest, neck to neck,

670
00:42:11,980 --> 00:42:12,940
it's much more difficult.

671
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:17,660
Yeah.

672
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:22,640
How does this mortals
consider a turnout of,

673
00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:27,620
uh, there are different groups
of voters since, uh, uh,

674
00:42:27,621 --> 00:42:31,690
if you will pull a PR people or my,
my,

675
00:42:31,691 --> 00:42:33,980
my nose Zam our bill.
Not Actual evolve.

676
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:38,750
Yeah. So, so, so that is based on
anecdotal or historical evidence?

677
00:42:39,750 --> 00:42:42,480
I am. I, yeah. Yeah. So, so, so, so,

678
00:42:42,481 --> 00:42:46,080
so a buy a bicycle for, uh, for example,

679
00:42:46,081 --> 00:42:50,070
if you say that your most of young
people, they will vote labor, uh,

680
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:53,480
and uh, uh, and also you have the HR.

681
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:55,710
Is it when a young voters,

682
00:42:56,520 --> 00:43:01,070
a actual dot don't vote? Uh, okay. Uh,

683
00:43:01,170 --> 00:43:05,650
can you decrees, uh, as a, as a, as a,

684
00:43:06,090 --> 00:43:08,600
as a,
as a prediction for Labor for

685
00:43:08,690 --> 00:43:10,670
all right. Yeah. So that's what is done.

686
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:15,080
So you have your prior information,
believe whatever you call it,

687
00:43:15,081 --> 00:43:19,700
about voting in propo propensity toward
across different socioeconomic groups

688
00:43:19,701 --> 00:43:23,990
and you scale it up or down based on
that from what you get from the survey.

689
00:43:24,170 --> 00:43:25,003
Yeah.

690
00:43:25,820 --> 00:43:29,350
Do people ever try and do
adaptive sampling? In some sense?

691
00:43:29,380 --> 00:43:34,380
You sink that you have a certain prior
belief that say people in Scotland always

692
00:43:34,731 --> 00:43:38,180
vote for one party and then you
start sampling, you start sampling.

693
00:43:38,181 --> 00:43:40,640
Then when you find that
actually they don't anymore.

694
00:43:41,180 --> 00:43:44,050
What people have a second round
of sampling where they, uh Huh.

695
00:43:44,390 --> 00:43:48,570
Yeah. I mean ideally that
would be good to do, but uh,

696
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,570
the time constraint comes
in because you know,

697
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:55,590
typically you would like to do it as
close as possible to the publication date

698
00:43:55,591 --> 00:44:00,591
or telecast Stein and you may not
have enough time to take in all this

699
00:44:00,601 --> 00:44:02,310
information and change sample sizes.

700
00:44:02,311 --> 00:44:06,180
But if you do see something very
different from what you had expected,

701
00:44:06,181 --> 00:44:10,080
then a second round of Paul
is indeed would add value.

702
00:44:10,081 --> 00:44:14,520
So in that sense the adaptive thing is
desirable but maybe not always doable.

703
00:44:17,340 --> 00:44:21,080
Uh, I was wondering, um, sorry
to follow up on that. If there's,

704
00:44:21,150 --> 00:44:22,590
if you do a blended thing,

705
00:44:22,591 --> 00:44:26,880
cause you're talking about like there's
a different methods of sampling and some

706
00:44:26,881 --> 00:44:29,730
are more expensive than others and if you,

707
00:44:29,970 --> 00:44:33,210
I don't know if you asked people on who
would they'd vote for and if that's any

708
00:44:33,211 --> 00:44:37,310
different to phone poles versus like
knocking on doors versus, I don't know,

709
00:44:37,340 --> 00:44:39,360
are there even more expensive approaches?

710
00:44:39,361 --> 00:44:43,500
Like just do sort of blend them together?
Is that an approach?

711
00:44:44,830 --> 00:44:49,300
Well I have not done so till now
because uh, the, uh, the, the,

712
00:44:49,301 --> 00:44:50,720
the group which is on Twitter,

713
00:44:50,721 --> 00:44:55,100
Facebook and such in India is very
small proportion of the overall thing.

714
00:44:55,370 --> 00:44:58,760
So even if I want to blend that in,
I will have to give it a very tiny weight.

715
00:44:59,420 --> 00:45:03,440
So that's why we have not done it.
But I guess another 10 years later,

716
00:45:03,441 --> 00:45:08,330
I'm sure we'll be forced to do that too.
As it be here. They may be doing it.

717
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:13,170
Okay. Here on us because another thing
we just said is that, you know, uh,

718
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:14,960
it's also opinion makers.

719
00:45:14,961 --> 00:45:18,830
So somebody is on the Facebook and
he's giving his or her opinion.

720
00:45:18,860 --> 00:45:20,420
If they are able to influence,

721
00:45:20,421 --> 00:45:23,240
let's say they're people who they
are come in touch with. Okay.

722
00:45:24,290 --> 00:45:27,020
So these are influenced makers.
So typically these people,

723
00:45:27,260 --> 00:45:30,170
so each one may be influencing
a few others choices.

724
00:45:30,171 --> 00:45:34,040
So therefore that should be taken into
account is what one group is advocate.

725
00:45:34,041 --> 00:45:37,370
So or time, I'm sure it will
be needed to be factored in.

726
00:45:39,860 --> 00:45:40,210
Hi.

727
00:45:40,210 --> 00:45:45,210
Could you talk a little bit about people's
motivations for actually wanting pull

728
00:45:45,491 --> 00:45:48,010
data? I guess one obvious
example is, you know,

729
00:45:48,011 --> 00:45:51,610
it's a political party or a lobbyist use
trying to actually influence the result

730
00:45:51,611 --> 00:45:53,550
and therefore they're probably
interested in, you know,

731
00:45:53,560 --> 00:45:55,240
what are the marginal seats,
you know,

732
00:45:55,241 --> 00:45:59,380
am I very vulnerable to let's say the
youth vote and d slight fluctuations in

733
00:45:59,381 --> 00:46:00,640
the youth vote in this constituency.

734
00:46:00,641 --> 00:46:04,780
In which case they're not just going
to be interested in the, the final,

735
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:06,820
your final answer,
your final prediction,

736
00:46:06,821 --> 00:46:10,690
but also some of the variables that went
into it and what influence they have

737
00:46:10,691 --> 00:46:15,130
and where they should be focusing their
attention. I mean, Dee Dee, do you, um,

738
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:18,130
do the people who are
commissioning your poles,

739
00:46:18,220 --> 00:46:21,010
are they interested in that type of
information or do they have other

740
00:46:21,011 --> 00:46:21,844
motivations?

741
00:46:22,220 --> 00:46:27,150
Uh, well, I'm sure that motivated
was which one fed information,

742
00:46:27,170 --> 00:46:31,830
but the ones with whom I am associated
with this purely a media pool and uh,

743
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:37,240
it is guided out by a group of people
who are social scientists and they are

744
00:46:37,521 --> 00:46:41,780
interested in doing it because this is
valuable data for their own research into

745
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:44,390
getting insight into why
people vote the way they did.

746
00:46:44,450 --> 00:46:45,980
What were the reasons driving the vote.

747
00:46:46,610 --> 00:46:51,610
So a month after they are a
television program is over,

748
00:46:51,981 --> 00:46:56,420
these guys would be coming the data and
coming to more deeper answers to these

749
00:46:56,421 --> 00:46:57,254
questions.
So,

750
00:46:58,340 --> 00:47:01,940
but I'm sure political parties do get
a polling done on this basis by other

751
00:47:01,941 --> 00:47:02,774
agencies

752
00:47:05,810 --> 00:47:07,990
in cases where the, uh, the,

753
00:47:08,510 --> 00:47:13,510
the opinions are very close or is
changing. Then posts seems, you know,

754
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:17,220
like you suggested earlier that, you
know, they seem to be less accurate. Uh,

755
00:47:18,110 --> 00:47:21,080
apart from the solution of not doing
polling and just ignoring all the polling

756
00:47:21,081 --> 00:47:22,340
data,
what,

757
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:27,760
what will you suggest kind of posters
kind of do in the future to improve?

758
00:47:28,551 --> 00:47:30,040
What are we doing today that we

759
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:32,460
should be doing, you know,
a year from now when,

760
00:47:32,461 --> 00:47:35,980
when we detect that there was a
mood change, you know, in the,

761
00:47:36,010 --> 00:47:37,090
in the general population?

762
00:47:38,300 --> 00:47:40,590
Uh, well, uh,

763
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:45,510
a lot depends on what money is
available to do the poll. Okay.

764
00:47:47,650 --> 00:47:52,590
Not for the opinion poll. Okay.
So, uh, one thing could be to ask,

765
00:47:52,591 --> 00:47:57,270
uh, uh, not just the sample size, but
even the questionnaire could be adapted.

766
00:47:57,420 --> 00:47:59,910
Uh, you know, if you, you know,

767
00:47:59,911 --> 00:48:03,660
we are tracking the same people and if
you today say something different from

768
00:48:03,661 --> 00:48:04,950
what you said one week ago,

769
00:48:05,250 --> 00:48:07,680
then the questions I should
ask you should be more probing.

770
00:48:07,980 --> 00:48:11,100
You know what happened during this week.
So I will,

771
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:13,530
everybody based on newspaper
reports are media reports,

772
00:48:13,531 --> 00:48:15,360
would know five big events which happen.

773
00:48:15,750 --> 00:48:19,710
So then we should drill down into each
of these influence you or change. Okay.

774
00:48:20,610 --> 00:48:24,990
Things like that can be done, but
it requires a lot more money. So,

775
00:48:25,350 --> 00:48:28,140
uh, let me, uh,

776
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:32,910
maybe one or two more comments then
the other than media these days.

777
00:48:32,940 --> 00:48:36,000
The other interesting opinion
polls is the financial markets.

778
00:48:36,420 --> 00:48:39,480
So if you read the evening tabloids
the day before the polling,

779
00:48:39,810 --> 00:48:42,810
they were giving various scenarios
and how will the market react?

780
00:48:43,410 --> 00:48:46,440
And so the market players are
very much interested in, uh,

781
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:49,800
because finally the election
outcome does it impact the market.

782
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:55,170
So they are very much interested
in anticipating this. And
uh, in India has seen,

783
00:48:55,230 --> 00:48:58,230
uh, financial, uh, groups, uh,

784
00:48:58,440 --> 00:49:02,730
commissioning survey are trying to get
us to come and talk to them and get

785
00:49:02,790 --> 00:49:06,670
bigger, better insight into
what is happening. I'm sure
it is happening here too.

786
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:09,570
So the financial, so more
time, more than the media,

787
00:49:09,571 --> 00:49:13,710
it could be the financial markets,
which would be engaging pollsters perhaps.

788
00:49:16,030 --> 00:49:17,670
I have a bit of a question about the,
um,

789
00:49:17,830 --> 00:49:22,590
the use of opinion polls to influence the
outcome of elections and whether there

790
00:49:22,650 --> 00:49:26,910
has been any examples of political
parties trying to introduce biased opinion

791
00:49:26,911 --> 00:49:31,080
polls or introduce bias into the sampling
methods or anything like that to try

792
00:49:31,081 --> 00:49:31,980
and,
um,

793
00:49:32,130 --> 00:49:36,450
sort of shift the election
in their direction and if
that sort of thing does or

794
00:49:36,451 --> 00:49:40,230
could happen, what they might might
be to, uh, to protect against that.

795
00:49:41,120 --> 00:49:42,190
Yeah, so, uh,

796
00:49:43,850 --> 00:49:48,680
in India and I would want to
have [inaudible] but there
is enough circumstantial

797
00:49:48,681 --> 00:49:52,430
evidence that this kind of
things have happened. And, uh,

798
00:49:52,790 --> 00:49:55,380
all I can say is that, you know, we had,

799
00:49:55,610 --> 00:49:59,450
we not been approached and we were with
the media house for whom we were doing

800
00:49:59,451 --> 00:50:02,740
the polls. We had a very
clear, uh, understanding, uh,

801
00:50:03,110 --> 00:50:07,670
contract that a, they cannot
influence what we will say
after commissioning. Paul.

802
00:50:07,671 --> 00:50:10,280
They can refuse to put us on here.
That is their prerogative.

803
00:50:10,580 --> 00:50:11,630
But if they put us on air,

804
00:50:11,631 --> 00:50:15,610
we will only say what our surveys
say even if it is wrong. But, uh,

805
00:50:15,611 --> 00:50:19,040
there are in fact in India two years ago,

806
00:50:19,070 --> 00:50:22,460
they were before this a high profile
election, there was a sting operation.

807
00:50:23,030 --> 00:50:27,450
Somebody posing as a, an acting on behalf
of certain political parties went act,

808
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:31,610
talk to 10 different agencies and uh,
uh,

809
00:50:31,730 --> 00:50:35,120
trying to indirectly say that,
you know, what, if you know,

810
00:50:35,121 --> 00:50:40,121
we want to fine tune your findings in a
certain way and seven out of the 10 did

811
00:50:40,131 --> 00:50:41,710
indicate that the EIT may cost.

812
00:50:41,711 --> 00:50:44,120
But it is possible we can
debate and discuss such things.

813
00:50:44,121 --> 00:50:46,160
They were caught on camera.
So

814
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:50,593
yeah,

815
00:50:50,910 --> 00:50:53,370
in the, uh, in the u s the,

816
00:50:53,371 --> 00:50:57,030
there is a newspaper who did a completely
different approach. They had like, uh,

817
00:50:57,130 --> 00:51:00,720
a group of 100 or 160
people of which they,

818
00:51:00,850 --> 00:51:03,550
the opinion and based on
that data inferences on,

819
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:06,920
on what they believed the election
results would be. What is your opinion on,

820
00:51:06,921 --> 00:51:09,210
on such an approach
instead of random sampling?

821
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:11,033
Uh,

822
00:51:12,270 --> 00:51:16,760
I would say, uh, I won't go
with that. I mean, they, uh,

823
00:51:16,870 --> 00:51:19,590
they may be right on occasions, but, uh,

824
00:51:19,980 --> 00:51:23,670
there's no reason why these hundred
people alone would determine what is the

825
00:51:23,671 --> 00:51:27,720
entire mood in the nation, right? I
mean, um, and we changed that hundred,

826
00:51:27,721 --> 00:51:32,130
2000 doesn't Jay, of course, we know
that e television rating system,

827
00:51:32,140 --> 00:51:36,210
PRP system is everywhere based
on such an approach. Okay.

828
00:51:36,570 --> 00:51:41,040
But it's debated, uh, there, the
question is what else can they do?

829
00:51:43,030 --> 00:51:43,190
Okay.

830
00:51:43,190 --> 00:51:47,600
But in our opinion, Paul, having
a fixed sample could track, uh,

831
00:51:48,740 --> 00:51:50,150
I think would have a limited value,

832
00:51:50,151 --> 00:51:53,960
but when we'll have to see how
their predictions evolve over time.

833
00:51:54,410 --> 00:51:57,920
Ultimately,
that's the only measure overall thing.

834
00:52:01,930 --> 00:52:05,940
Any more questions?
If there are no questions anymore,

835
00:52:06,270 --> 00:52:09,750
then please thank our guest.
Thank you very much.

836
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:11,450
Thank you.
