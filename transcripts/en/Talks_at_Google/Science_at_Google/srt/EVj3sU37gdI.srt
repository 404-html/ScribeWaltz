1
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:13,280
So I would spend the next
30 minutes talking to you
about my work in the last 12

2
00:00:17,521 --> 00:00:20,070
years in neuroscientist and
I leave some all afterwards,

3
00:00:20,071 --> 00:00:24,840
both for questions about how
it translates to business,

4
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:28,860
which is somewhat what I do right now,
but also to a,

5
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:31,260
what I call the inspiration part,

6
00:00:31,261 --> 00:00:33,560
where I tried to also tell
you why I think it's a,

7
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:36,840
not just a theoretical idea
that you'd be done by labs,

8
00:00:36,841 --> 00:00:41,370
but also something that would be in
your life in the coming years. Okay. So

9
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:49,260
maybe I should start with something else.
I tend to speak very fast,

10
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,390
especially when I get excited.

11
00:00:51,391 --> 00:00:56,070
So I need someone from you from the front
row to raise your hand every time it

12
00:00:56,071 --> 00:00:59,820
becomes too fast you think for
yourself or for the audience.

13
00:00:59,821 --> 00:01:01,680
So everyone gets to raise their hand.

14
00:01:01,681 --> 00:01:05,040
But you may be channel everyone
else with the beer. Okay,

15
00:01:05,490 --> 00:01:10,490
so the point of my talk,

16
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:13,140
I'm going to give it to me
in the beginning and then
I think we did at the end,

17
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:18,120
is to suggest that our understanding
of the brain has evolved in the last 10

18
00:01:18,121 --> 00:01:18,954
years.

19
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:24,020
And what it's brought to us is some
new thinking about kind of our role in

20
00:01:24,271 --> 00:01:25,590
controlling our behavior.

21
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:31,130
So whereas we used to think of the brain
as the kind of equivalent of who we are

22
00:01:31,471 --> 00:01:32,970
as US equals our brain,

23
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:36,120
we now have more understanding
of the fact that maybe in your,

24
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:41,040
there's more than one entity if you
want living with you and governing your

25
00:01:41,041 --> 00:01:41,550
thoughts.

26
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:46,380
And part of what we call our consciousness
or us is a mechanism that comes and

27
00:01:46,381 --> 00:01:51,381
takes all the historical events in your
memory and weaves them into a narrative.

28
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:55,290
And what it does mostly is looking at
the past and trying to kind of come up

29
00:01:55,291 --> 00:01:58,290
with a story that's coherent.
It can explain this behavior.

30
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:02,400
And the reason it's important and not
just a theoretical idea is because once we

31
00:02:02,401 --> 00:02:03,660
accepted this idea,

32
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:08,160
we can actually go into your memory and
change things and you will create a new

33
00:02:08,161 --> 00:02:09,090
narrative for yourself.

34
00:02:09,091 --> 00:02:12,780
And you will never questioned
this understanding of who you are.

35
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:16,770
And you would just walk in your day with
different understandings of who you are.

36
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:20,910
So what we call consciousness
isn't just a Eh,

37
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:24,860
how we tell our story isn't just what
we call it. The tooth isn't, Eh, uh,

38
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:28,140
experience of the reality
that we go through.

39
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:33,260
It's also a way for us to make sense of
the world and in the context of both a

40
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:38,640
psychology and business. When we
tried to talk about changing behavior,

41
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:43,560
many times we try to teach people and
give them our information and think that

42
00:02:43,561 --> 00:02:46,290
if we just give them the
right information, everything
is going to be different.

43
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:47,940
They're going to understand
and behave differently.

44
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:50,460
And now we come up with a totally
different idea of how we do that.

45
00:02:50,461 --> 00:02:54,240
We just changed something in your brain
that leads you to just wake up with a

46
00:02:54,241 --> 00:02:57,450
different behavior than just to carry
that forward and tell yourself a story

47
00:02:57,451 --> 00:03:01,870
that it was always what you it. So, Eh,

48
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:07,690
in many ways this is not a trivial thing
to understand that these three pounds,

49
00:03:07,691 --> 00:03:11,590
the team between our ears actually govern
who we are in everything that we do.

50
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:16,570
And they actually allow us to change
someone's behavior by just changing small

51
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:18,250
indicators in there.

52
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:23,950
And where whereas I spend a lot
of my time thinking about that.

53
00:03:23,951 --> 00:03:27,370
It's still hard for me to accept
what I'm going to end the stock with,

54
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:32,550
which is that if you learn to cope with
your brain is something that drives

55
00:03:33,431 --> 00:03:37,510
things without you actually having a
full understanding of why they happen.

56
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:40,710
But kind of explain it differently. You
can actually change your behavior. Eh,

57
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,160
the best analogy I found,

58
00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:46,720
it was one that I explained when I was
a little kid that allowed me to kind of

59
00:03:46,721 --> 00:03:48,460
think about the world differently.
So when I was a kid,

60
00:03:48,461 --> 00:03:53,461
I grew up in Israel in the early eighties
and at the time computers were Sunni,

61
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:57,790
expensive and queer games were very scars.

62
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:59,050
So if you want it to play computer games,

63
00:03:59,051 --> 00:04:02,620
you would go to an arcade store when they
had this big machine and you can play

64
00:04:02,621 --> 00:04:03,454
games.

65
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:08,700
When I was a big fan of this game that
some of you may be still familiar with

66
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,150
it. You play this little Italian plumber
below and you're trying to save the

67
00:04:13,151 --> 00:04:17,980
princess that this vicious goal kidnapped
and Goya throws burns at you that you

68
00:04:17,981 --> 00:04:21,750
tried to dodge while climbing up.
And I went to the arcade, stolen,

69
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:26,200
played this game for roughly 30 seconds,
doing a pretty good job.

70
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,990
So I managed to get to the second
level and kind of, you know,

71
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:30,750
dodge a few barrels.
We went,

72
00:04:30,751 --> 00:04:34,570
suddenly two words appeared on the screen
that changed my view of control and

73
00:04:34,571 --> 00:04:36,160
the two words were insert coin.

74
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:40,120
And what it meant was that I
wasn't playing the game at all.

75
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:43,060
I was watching a video,
a demo of the game playing itself,

76
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,980
and I was just seeing it happening.
But in my mind I was in control.

77
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:53,260
So the movie was showing how the game
goes and the character was moving up and

78
00:04:53,261 --> 00:04:56,080
down and jumping about barrels and so on.
And I was actually moving a joystick,

79
00:04:56,081 --> 00:04:58,870
but there was no connection
between the joystick and the movie.

80
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:01,870
But in my mind that was,
I was Sherman control.

81
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:06,760
Now granted the intentions for the movie
and my intentions were aligned so it

82
00:05:06,761 --> 00:05:10,060
made sense for me to try to go up when
the character moved up to go left,

83
00:05:10,061 --> 00:05:12,010
when it went left to
press the jump button.

84
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:16,870
Granted there probably were times where
I tried to move right and it moved left

85
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:18,250
or try to jump on.
It didn't.

86
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:22,210
But because for the most part the
movie aligned with my intentions,

87
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:26,500
I was able to them have a story that
says that I'm in control and only when I

88
00:05:26,501 --> 00:05:30,130
was confronted with reality in a way
that I couldn't really visit anymore.

89
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:30,701
I said,
okay,

90
00:05:30,701 --> 00:05:33,670
I guess I'm just watching a movie and
the reason I'm telling you these stories,

91
00:05:33,671 --> 00:05:37,120
because this in my mind is the best
analogy we have right now to how the brain

92
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:40,810
and our consciousness work.
Things happen to us,

93
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:42,640
behaviors or cure.

94
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:48,270
And we after the fact come back and own
them claimed that we had agency and try

95
00:05:48,581 --> 00:05:51,910
to tell a story that made us do
those things as if we want to do.

96
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:54,370
And this is hard to accept.

97
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:56,650
I'm going to repeat that one
more time towards the end,

98
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:59,900
but that is the message of what we are
listening right now. But the brain,

99
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:03,290
which is for the most part things happen
and we can explain them if you look at

100
00:06:03,291 --> 00:06:06,740
their brain, but we don't necessarily
explain them well if we ask you.

101
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:09,590
So if we ask you to tell us a story,
you will come up with a story.

102
00:06:09,591 --> 00:06:12,350
If I ask you why you did what you did,
you will always have an answer.

103
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:15,350
But more and more we see that there was
a misalignment between the answer that

104
00:06:15,351 --> 00:06:19,160
you give and what our brain tells us
and sometimes even how you actually will

105
00:06:19,161 --> 00:06:23,720
expand your intentions. So this
is a theoretical idea. However,

106
00:06:23,721 --> 00:06:26,570
there are by now a few ways
for us to actually test it.

107
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:29,480
So in one of the studies
that we're running right now,

108
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,330
it's based on a study that was done
here in New York a few years ago.

109
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:37,570
We essentially are able to show people
the gap between the moment that your

110
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:41,180
brain made a choice in the moment
you come to explain this choice.

111
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:43,580
And we can show you that those
are not necessarily aligned.

112
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:46,190
And in fact we can change things and
you will still defend your choice.

113
00:06:46,191 --> 00:06:47,720
So what we do in this study,

114
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:54,200
we essentially bring people to the lab
to make very basic choices that mean

115
00:06:54,201 --> 00:06:57,440
nothing to them but are
continuous and repeated.

116
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,840
So the idea is if you're a subject in
the study would bring to elaborate, Eh,

117
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:04,880
you will sit down and the guy in the
back who was running the experiment will

118
00:07:04,881 --> 00:07:08,780
pull to do counts and he would
ask you to make a choice.

119
00:07:08,781 --> 00:07:11,600
And the choice is a which of
the two people you see here,

120
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:14,390
you find more attractive. The guy on
the left and the guy in the right.

121
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:17,430
So let's play it. We deal. Who Do you
find more attractive? The guy on the left,

122
00:07:17,431 --> 00:07:22,100
the guy, the right, the guy
in the left. Why smiling?

123
00:07:22,101 --> 00:07:25,220
So this is one trial at about
100 tries to this experiment.

124
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:28,220
Let's say you're a subject. We showed
you two cards. You make a choice.

125
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:30,980
We give me card that shows you're
holding in your hand and you say,

126
00:07:30,981 --> 00:07:34,130
I like this guy because he's smiling.
Now you don't know any of them.

127
00:07:34,131 --> 00:07:37,790
They mean nothing to you. It's many, many
choices at all are kind of arbitrarily.

128
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:40,850
But you make them and you always
have an answer. So if you did this,

129
00:07:40,851 --> 00:07:44,300
we put a new pair of cards again,
had you make a decision,

130
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:46,920
give the card experience, so on. So
this is the experiment we off SPEC.

131
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:49,880
They're very simple,
but there's actually a twist here.

132
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:53,510
It makes it more interesting
because the guy in the back,

133
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:56,330
the guy that gives you the
card isn't just a regular guy.

134
00:07:57,050 --> 00:08:02,050
He's a magician that we hired and he
uses sleight of hands in one out of every

135
00:08:03,051 --> 00:08:06,020
say 20 trials to give you
the code you didn't choose.

136
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:08,300
So if you chose the guy on the left,

137
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,490
he would give you the card
with the guy on the right.

138
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:16,130
And two interesting things happen in
this experiment. First, people early.

139
00:08:16,131 --> 00:08:17,670
Notice people rarely say no.

140
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:20,930
I chose this one and you gave me the
other one that's already interesting.

141
00:08:20,931 --> 00:08:24,830
But what's more interesting is that when
they get the card, they didn't speak,

142
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:29,840
they go on and explain to us why this
was their choice. So you chose a,

143
00:08:29,841 --> 00:08:33,410
I give you big, take me on your side,
what would be because of so and so.

144
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:37,580
Now I've got an it not going to work.
If it was a significant important choice,

145
00:08:37,581 --> 00:08:40,160
I can't replace your wife or
husband and you would not notice,

146
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:42,980
I can't replace you know
thing your career or your job.

147
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:46,440
But we're playing with more and more
complex things and turns out we can expand

148
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:47,443
and change.

149
00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:51,110
I don't have to think that people think
they would never be able to explain

150
00:08:51,111 --> 00:08:55,260
differently. So we can change people's
preferences on politics now and it works.

151
00:08:55,261 --> 00:08:59,370
So not really democratic public and
vice versa, but on some new ones,

152
00:08:59,371 --> 00:09:02,700
choices like gun control in
and they may be climate change.

153
00:09:02,701 --> 00:09:05,820
We can actually move you a little bit
just by changing what you think you have

154
00:09:05,821 --> 00:09:09,490
chosen.
And also we,

155
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:14,520
we basically can can a used it in the
context of business to show you how little

156
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:19,770
you know about your business choices when
it comes to marketing. So for example,

157
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:22,980
you mentioned you go to the grocery
store to buy a variety of things and you

158
00:09:22,981 --> 00:09:26,600
have like a shopping list and you go and
you at some point get to the aisle with

159
00:09:26,601 --> 00:09:28,740
a toothpaste and you say,
okay to the patient's important choice,

160
00:09:28,741 --> 00:09:31,890
I'm going to actually give this one a
lot of attention and you look at the two

161
00:09:31,891 --> 00:09:35,040
options that you have there. Let's say
Colgate and crest and you say, okay,

162
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:38,640
the one on the left is more expensive
but this one is a big bigger and this one

163
00:09:38,641 --> 00:09:39,251
is mean you,

164
00:09:39,251 --> 00:09:41,970
but this one is whitening and you kind
of make a table of all the things that

165
00:09:41,971 --> 00:09:43,920
you think are important.
Then you make a choice,

166
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,690
you put it in your basket
and you go on shopping.

167
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:47,190
If I'm going to go into your basket.

168
00:09:47,191 --> 00:09:49,960
At some point between the moment you made
the choice and the moment you get to a

169
00:09:49,961 --> 00:09:53,130
checkout counter and they place
the item with the other option,

170
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,380
chances are that you
won't notice this change,

171
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:58,170
but not only that when you go inside,
if I stuck around and I say, hey,

172
00:09:58,171 --> 00:09:59,270
there's a focus group,

173
00:09:59,271 --> 00:10:03,320
you want to know why you chose this
versus that you got a competent answer and

174
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:04,350
the reality is that it's very,

175
00:10:04,351 --> 00:10:09,351
very hard for us to accept the fact that
memo is in our mind are not necessarily

176
00:10:09,541 --> 00:10:13,080
too, we're going to spend a lot of
time protecting our memories. In fact,

177
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:17,610
there's a lot of discussion right now
out there about a fake news and fake

178
00:10:17,611 --> 00:10:21,510
information and and people spend a lot
of times challenging and being skeptical

179
00:10:21,511 --> 00:10:23,190
about things coming in from the outside.
They say,

180
00:10:23,191 --> 00:10:25,410
I don't really trust this
piece of information.

181
00:10:25,411 --> 00:10:27,360
I'm going to validate that
they're going to argue against it.

182
00:10:27,361 --> 00:10:29,220
If it's something that
we don't really like,

183
00:10:29,221 --> 00:10:32,310
we're going to spend a lot of mental
effort trying to convince the person who

184
00:10:32,311 --> 00:10:34,650
gives it to us but they're wrong or that
something is not right about the fact

185
00:10:34,651 --> 00:10:37,650
that we never ever challenged
the fact that all of the inside,

186
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:41,310
this is something that we protect.
So if you leave this room right now,

187
00:10:41,311 --> 00:10:42,870
when you go have dinner
with your friends tonight,

188
00:10:42,871 --> 00:10:46,680
and at some 0.1 of your friends said,
oh, it was amazing what we did today.

189
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:49,540
When you played tennis, it's
1:00 PM he said, no, no, no.

190
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:52,320
At 1:00 PM I was in a talk in
my office and they say, no, no.

191
00:10:52,321 --> 00:10:55,380
At 1:00 PM we were playing
tennis. You'd say, come on.

192
00:10:55,381 --> 00:10:58,070
I remember clearly I was in the soup.
I can describe the wound to you.

193
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,650
They're going to start showing
you evidence of video of
yourself playing tennis.

194
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:04,230
10 people that were there telling
you we were, were you playing tennis?

195
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:07,020
It's going to take a lot of effort for
them to convince you that you weren't

196
00:11:07,021 --> 00:11:07,621
where you work,

197
00:11:07,621 --> 00:11:11,520
where you were because your mind is
set to protect what it thinks is too.

198
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:14,460
That is kind of an essential
part of our reality.

199
00:11:14,461 --> 00:11:17,730
We don't challenge things that are already
inside and in many ways this is what

200
00:11:17,731 --> 00:11:20,910
I'm going to argue is a, one
of the different things we
need to change right now,

201
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:24,810
which is the fact that our brain isn't
fully in control of what's going on,

202
00:11:24,811 --> 00:11:27,630
but also that the memos and the stories
that we tell ourselves are coming up

203
00:11:27,631 --> 00:11:29,670
afterwards and aren't necessarily to,
in fact,

204
00:11:29,671 --> 00:11:31,530
my students made this
teacher that I liked and say,

205
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:35,130
don't believe everything you think,
which is kind of a joke,

206
00:11:35,131 --> 00:11:37,020
but also the message of today's talk,

207
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:41,550
which is that somehow what's inside
is not guaranteed. Okay. Up to now,

208
00:11:41,551 --> 00:11:42,600
I kind of give you a philosophy.

209
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,330
Let's talk a little bit more about
practical thing we do with people.

210
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:50,160
So we look at the brain and trying to
understand how the brain actually encodes

211
00:11:50,161 --> 00:11:53,650
information and how thoughts get in Saudi
and into the brain and it was stored

212
00:11:53,651 --> 00:11:55,810
and how we actually talk about that,

213
00:11:56,260 --> 00:12:00,760
and I assume I don't have to convince you
too much that the brain is the seat of

214
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,380
your thoughts and your behaviors,

215
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:07,210
but we have more and more evidence right
now from people whose brains change and

216
00:12:07,211 --> 00:12:09,040
with those changes,
their personality change.

217
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:12,700
The suggested actually really
who we are is in our brain.

218
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:16,750
So much so that it's stronger
than what we think is us.

219
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,430
I'll give you an example.

220
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:23,840
You may be familiar with the story of
a woman in San Diego in I think eight

221
00:12:24,101 --> 00:12:27,070
years ago roughly calling
the police and saying,

222
00:12:27,071 --> 00:12:31,320
my husband I've been married to for
the last 10 years became a pedophile.

223
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:34,120
I don't know what to do. I'm really
worried about our four year old daughter.

224
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:36,730
You've got to come and arrest my husband.

225
00:12:37,210 --> 00:12:40,780
And the police indeed come and they find
child pornography on his computer and

226
00:12:40,781 --> 00:12:43,390
they arrest him and he goes to court.
And as the trial begins,

227
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:47,320
he complains about the headache
and it's ignored. On the first day,

228
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:49,270
you can go on the second day,
on the third day,

229
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:51,160
he has a seizure in the courthouse.

230
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:55,100
So they pick him up and carry him quickly
to the emergency room or on the wall.

231
00:12:55,101 --> 00:12:59,890
It just looked at his brain and what they
see is a massive tumor pressing on the

232
00:12:59,891 --> 00:13:03,400
left front part of his brain that
should have caused them also pain,

233
00:13:03,401 --> 00:13:04,660
but definitely risks his life.

234
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:07,840
So they're setting straight from the
emergency order, the operating room,

235
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:10,570
where a surgeon will be more of
the tumor in a complex surgery.

236
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:14,020
And then when he wakes up after 12 hours
of surgery, he no longer has a tumor,

237
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:18,280
but also he is no longer the file. It
says, I don't know, happened to me.

238
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:22,690
It was embarrassing and I'm ashamed that
I'm guilty and I don't know to do with

239
00:13:22,691 --> 00:13:27,520
that. And he goes to court and in an
unprecedented bowling to that point,

240
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:30,970
the judge in his coat actually sends him
back home and she writes in her ruling,

241
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:36,020
Eh, that Eh, it wasn't his
fault, it was his parents'
fault, which kind of, you know,

242
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:39,610
cause for philosophical idea of what the
difference between me on your brain and

243
00:13:39,611 --> 00:13:43,150
this story is just one example of
how changing your brain changes and

244
00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:43,750
personality.

245
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:47,350
But actually it has a Twix typically a
bit more interesting because 10 months

246
00:13:47,351 --> 00:13:49,660
later after the guy who was
sent to the common probation,

247
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:52,990
the wife calls a second time and says,
my husband is a butterfly again.

248
00:13:53,890 --> 00:13:57,700
Can you do something about it? And he's
being taken again to the emergency room.

249
00:13:57,701 --> 00:14:00,670
We were looking at his brain and they
say it's part of the tumors came back,

250
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:02,900
but that's a side and it's
pressing on the same area.

251
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:06,430
And so he is going into a second procedure
where they take it out a second time.

252
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:08,590
And again it goes back
to his normal behavior.

253
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,030
So this is like a controlled experiment.

254
00:14:10,031 --> 00:14:12,370
You'll be able to one way you have
it one way you change it to behave

255
00:14:12,371 --> 00:14:14,530
differently.
And it was just one example out of many,

256
00:14:14,531 --> 00:14:17,890
many examples where right now to the fact
that we can actually change your brain

257
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:21,730
a little bit and even against
your intentions, desires,

258
00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:25,120
you will become a different person in
some aspects of your life and it will be

259
00:14:25,121 --> 00:14:29,050
hard for you to go back. Okay, so
now that we kind of accepted that,

260
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:31,750
the question is can we find
who you are in your brain?

261
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:35,260
Can we change your personality and
can we also tell you who you are?

262
00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:37,120
Even when you say no,

263
00:14:37,121 --> 00:14:40,930
I want the opposite or expanding your
choices maybe even before you make them.

264
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:44,200
So for a while,
looking at the brain,

265
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:48,310
Eh was done in one of two big ways.
With animals,

266
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:52,670
we can obviously look at the
brain directly. We opened
their brain, mice, rats,

267
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:56,570
we stick electrodes inside our head and
those electrodes are fine microphones

268
00:14:56,810 --> 00:14:59,930
that listened to the activity
of a brain cells in a very,

269
00:14:59,931 --> 00:15:01,460
very accurate and precise way.

270
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:05,330
And tell us basically what the person
is or the animal is thinking about in a

271
00:15:05,331 --> 00:15:08,840
very, very direct way. That's the
ultimate way to study the brain.

272
00:15:08,841 --> 00:15:12,260
Looking directly inside one we can do
to animals. We conduct with humans,

273
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:13,393
obvious reasons.

274
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:18,020
So instead what we do with humans is we
studied the brain from the outside using

275
00:15:18,021 --> 00:15:18,770
imaging techniques.

276
00:15:18,770 --> 00:15:22,430
So we use big machines that
inject magnetic fields all
look at the activity from

277
00:15:22,431 --> 00:15:26,570
the outside and trying to infer a how the
brain works for looking at the outside.

278
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:31,730
If you were to somehow be able to poke
inside the brain and see what's going on

279
00:15:31,731 --> 00:15:32,510
there,

280
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:37,510
what you will see or is a forced
of cells that look like these.

281
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:42,560
And if you were to listen to them you
would hear the sound of self speaking,

282
00:15:42,561 --> 00:15:46,480
which is essentially perfect. Okay.

283
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:51,470
So if you were to translate the identical
chemical activity of brain cells,

284
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:52,430
how they speak to each other,

285
00:15:52,431 --> 00:15:56,240
you would hear this basically a
electrical discharges of ions,

286
00:15:56,510 --> 00:16:01,340
of movement, of a sales. If you want
to have ions from one cell to another.

287
00:16:01,341 --> 00:16:03,590
If you put a microphone next to
them and it translated into audio,

288
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:05,900
this is how it sounds.
So those bursts of activity,

289
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:09,650
those what we call it firing
is the language of the brain.

290
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:12,950
Each cell when it speaks,

291
00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:17,090
speaks by changing his firing
frequency from very low to very high.

292
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:21,440
And if we can tell what happened in the
real world while those cells were firing,

293
00:16:21,441 --> 00:16:23,120
we can actually decode
what you're thinking about.

294
00:16:23,121 --> 00:16:27,110
So if every time I show you a
picture of your mum, one cell fires,

295
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:30,240
we would say that this
collection indicates that
this is part of a network of

296
00:16:30,241 --> 00:16:33,590
fellows. That code thinking
about your mom. Okay?

297
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,630
So this is how thoughts look in the brain.

298
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:40,670
And this is where I also tell you that
I lied to you a few minutes ago and now

299
00:16:40,671 --> 00:16:42,800
I'm going to be clear about what we do.

300
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:45,110
So I told you that there was actually
two ways out of the brain with animals.

301
00:16:45,111 --> 00:16:46,910
We can look inside and we do
once we look at it outside,

302
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,370
but my lab is part of
a small group of lives,

303
00:16:49,371 --> 00:16:52,250
about five labs in the world
could actually do what I
just said was impossible,

304
00:16:52,251 --> 00:16:54,620
which was look at the brains
of humans from the inside.

305
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,520
What we do is we open people's brains,

306
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:03,860
we stick electrodes inside our head and
we eavesdrop on the acuity of individual

307
00:17:03,861 --> 00:17:07,670
cells in the brain while they think while
they're awake, when they're talking,

308
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,620
trying to understand how it works.

309
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:14,330
And I'm here to look for
volunteers for this project. Eh,

310
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:18,230
what we do is we work with patients
who undergo brain surgery for clinical

311
00:17:18,231 --> 00:17:23,231
purposes and we piggyback on the clinical
procedure to also study the brain for

312
00:17:25,911 --> 00:17:28,310
research purposes.
So I'm going to show you now how it looks.

313
00:17:28,311 --> 00:17:30,110
If you don't like pictures of brains,
this is and took away.

314
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:32,210
I'm going to show it for a brief
moment and then I'm gonna skip that.

315
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:33,740
This is roughly how it looks.

316
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:40,400
Electrodes on the surface of the brain
that are tiny enough to be able to decode

317
00:17:40,401 --> 00:17:43,310
the activity of individual cells
in the brains of our patients.

318
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:47,180
When we wrap it up and close it,
it looks like that. So this is a,

319
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:50,550
now you can look back if you look away,
this is almost obvious.

320
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:55,410
Patients come are patients typically
have a brain disorder that they couldn't

321
00:17:55,411 --> 00:17:59,460
resolve in any other way and the last
two years old so to speak is coming to a

322
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:04,230
clinical procedure where the neurosurgeons
are going to open their brain and

323
00:18:04,231 --> 00:18:09,231
tried to identify the spot in their
brain that is the main onset location for

324
00:18:10,531 --> 00:18:13,140
their problems.
So think of a epilepsy for example.

325
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:18,350
Epilepsy typically is an anomaly in your
brain where one cell in your brain so

326
00:18:19,651 --> 00:18:23,760
to speak, starts firing with
no reason, no provocation,

327
00:18:23,761 --> 00:18:27,300
kind of like an earthquake in your brain
and it speaks and other cells answer

328
00:18:27,301 --> 00:18:29,160
and other cells answers
those who answered them.

329
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:33,240
Before long there was a cacophony
of a cell speaking in your brain.

330
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:35,820
And when those cells picking your brain,

331
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:38,160
they actually lead to a
change in your behavior.

332
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:40,170
So when sales speak
without any provocation,

333
00:18:40,171 --> 00:18:42,810
maybe you start shaking or losing
consciousness and falling up down.

334
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,320
And the risk of course is that you may be,
we'll have a car accident,

335
00:18:45,321 --> 00:18:48,570
you could drag your cow or maybe you drop
your baby if you're holding your baby.

336
00:18:48,571 --> 00:18:51,810
So the risk beyond just the
epilepsy there is clear life.

337
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:55,890
Most patients with epilepsy get treated
with medications that suppress the

338
00:18:55,891 --> 00:18:56,670
seizures,

339
00:18:56,670 --> 00:18:59,460
but if they call it responsible
communications or something doesn't work,

340
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:01,170
they become candidates for this procedure.

341
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:02,640
What we're going to bring into the lab,

342
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,810
open their brain stick electrodes in the
area in their brain where we think or

343
00:19:06,811 --> 00:19:08,230
suspect of the seizures onset.

344
00:19:09,050 --> 00:19:12,210
We'll plug those wires to a computer
and it's not like holding their brain

345
00:19:12,211 --> 00:19:17,211
activity 24 seven for the next couple
of days while they sit there and wait to

346
00:19:17,701 --> 00:19:20,190
have a feature. Now we wanted to have a
seizure because when they have a seizure,

347
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:24,720
we can actually trace this seizures flow
in their brain as it goes and figure

348
00:19:24,721 --> 00:19:25,770
out exactly where it started.

349
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:29,100
And once we have enough features to
it that they find a location that can

350
00:19:29,101 --> 00:19:32,010
actually take out the electrodes
and the SEC, the part of the brain,

351
00:19:32,011 --> 00:19:35,710
it stopped the seizures, close everything,
and send the patient away seizure free.

352
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:39,630
So that's the clinical
purpose of this procedure.

353
00:19:39,810 --> 00:19:43,520
And what I do is I say to the patient,
you know, you're already here. Yeah,

354
00:19:43,521 --> 00:19:47,160
but I thought in your brain and when
holding your acuity all the time while you

355
00:19:47,161 --> 00:19:50,760
watch TV, read books, talk to your
friends, do you mind or thought,

356
00:19:50,770 --> 00:19:52,950
I think we showed you pictures of
Colgate and crest and see how you make

357
00:19:52,951 --> 00:19:55,440
decisions and understand how
thinking works in your brain.

358
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:58,410
Now the patients are very happy to
participate because they really can't move

359
00:19:58,411 --> 00:20:00,170
their head much,
and this is most of what they're doing,

360
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:01,350
their hospital talking to us.

361
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:04,380
So now there's a chance for us to actually
look at the brain over human from the

362
00:20:04,381 --> 00:20:08,790
inside and eavesdrop of activity of cells
in the brain and see how thinking look

363
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:11,760
from inside. So here's an example of
how it looks. So here's one patient.

364
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:16,260
What you see here are the images that
they see on a screen in front of their

365
00:20:16,261 --> 00:20:17,730
eyes and what are going to play.

366
00:20:17,731 --> 00:20:22,731
Two is the sound of one sale in their
brain that codes something and tried to

367
00:20:22,981 --> 00:20:25,200
see if we can figure out
yourself what this cell codes,

368
00:20:25,201 --> 00:20:27,210
what is the thought the decel responds to.

369
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:47,980
So this is the cell

370
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:50,830
in this woman's brain code,

371
00:20:51,010 --> 00:20:55,030
the thought of Melody Manoa every
time she thinks about him on the wall,

372
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:57,070
this cell fires and infecting
your brains right now,

373
00:20:57,071 --> 00:21:00,760
if you know what men and Moodle is or
who she is or have any concept of her,

374
00:21:00,761 --> 00:21:03,460
I mean if you think about that
sends in your brain, come to life.

375
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:04,660
And they did the same thing right now.

376
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:08,340
This is how I thought looks
inside the brain. Nope.

377
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:10,750
What's interesting is that this is not
just a thought that's specific to this

378
00:21:10,751 --> 00:21:11,400
image.

379
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:15,340
It's every representation of the Iud or
Manuel and we know that because it can

380
00:21:15,341 --> 00:21:19,510
do many things. We can actually show
her not just one picture studios.

381
00:21:19,511 --> 00:21:22,540
We can actually show her friends on
some movies and you'll see that when she

382
00:21:22,541 --> 00:21:23,770
sees a movie you would it it the law,

383
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:26,590
the same set of fires in a
different pattern but the same idea.

384
00:21:27,130 --> 00:21:31,130
So you heard him say that again,
movies

385
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:54,160
and you have Kevin to sustain as long
as I taught in this person's mind and

386
00:21:54,161 --> 00:21:55,280
what's even on the boulevard mall.

387
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:57,820
It's like it doesn't have
to come from the outside.

388
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:02,690
If you close your eyes and you mentioned
on the Lord the same thoughts we don't

389
00:22:02,691 --> 00:22:06,710
carry in your brain and the same cells
with fire and we know that because we

390
00:22:06,711 --> 00:22:08,260
tried it,
we don't have patients.

391
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:10,690
One of my callings actually
had the patient sitter,

392
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:12,640
I just like call from her memory.

393
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:16,690
The clips she has seen in the morning
once you're going to see now is that when

394
00:22:16,691 --> 00:22:20,200
the patient remembers my name on the wall,
the same cell fires,

395
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:24,310
and in fact it's fires
seconds before she speaks.

396
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:26,920
So we see her thoughts coming to her.

397
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:36,350
This means that we can now look inside
the patient's brain and see how her

398
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:37,350
thoughts in marriage.

399
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:39,840
And what's interesting here isn't
just that we can decode it thoughts,

400
00:22:39,841 --> 00:22:44,841
but also men can code them earlier than
she expresses them and even earlier than

401
00:22:45,601 --> 00:22:50,280
she thinks she taught them.
So if you asked the woman,
why did you think about it?

402
00:22:50,281 --> 00:22:50,491
My all,

403
00:22:50,491 --> 00:22:53,400
she wouldn't say when I said that
though a fraction of a second before she

404
00:22:53,401 --> 00:22:54,960
wouldn't imagine it in her brain.

405
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:58,410
There are cells that come to life that
code the thoughts second before she

406
00:22:58,411 --> 00:23:01,590
speaks. In fact, when I talk to you
right now, I don't really feel it.

407
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:05,630
Anything I'm saying is being
planned in my mind before I feel it,

408
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:06,480
whatever I think it,

409
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:10,560
I say it then the idea is that you
and I are both witnesses of my brain

410
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:13,470
happening, adjusted. I
own it. And I think that,

411
00:23:13,471 --> 00:23:15,180
I wanted to say because
it's out of my mouth,

412
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,990
we both experience whatever my
mind is saying in real time,

413
00:23:19,410 --> 00:23:22,710
but one of us thinks that it
must be something that I really,

414
00:23:22,711 --> 00:23:26,280
really feel comfortable with because
it came out of my mouth and we don't

415
00:23:26,281 --> 00:23:30,140
experience those bosses that's come up
with the verb and the structure and the

416
00:23:30,141 --> 00:23:33,720
vowels and put them together
and the adjective and
brilliant and build the idea.

417
00:23:33,721 --> 00:23:37,560
We just see the bottom line
and we call this my thoughts.

418
00:23:39,090 --> 00:23:41,730
Nope. Once we find Dalton your brain,
then we can actually code them.

419
00:23:41,731 --> 00:23:44,020
There's always we can do
with it beyond just eh, Eh,

420
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:44,940
predict what you're going to say.

421
00:23:44,941 --> 00:23:48,950
We also do all kinds of tickets are
now really in the public eye a lot,

422
00:23:48,951 --> 00:23:53,430
which is a connect your brain essentially
can machines and have you come knock

423
00:23:54,010 --> 00:23:54,770
on the outside wall.

424
00:23:54,770 --> 00:23:58,970
So we can do things like have the patient
sit there in bed and a play games with

425
00:23:58,971 --> 00:23:59,451
her mind.

426
00:23:59,451 --> 00:24:02,210
So she just sits there and thinks I've
met them on the wall and when she does

427
00:24:02,211 --> 00:24:04,070
the space you've goes up.
And we can have her play a game.

428
00:24:04,071 --> 00:24:06,650
We should try to avoid obstacles
just by thinking about them a lot.

429
00:24:06,651 --> 00:24:10,570
And it can kind of punishing her or
giving her a reward for doing that. Eh,

430
00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:13,230
we can do that, of course,
to show that we can.

431
00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:16,580
But the idea behind that is that we can
now take people who lost the ability to

432
00:24:16,581 --> 00:24:20,470
control some parts of their bodies
because the connection was separate.

433
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:23,990
Think of soldiers who were hit say from
the neck down and now have no connection

434
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:25,730
from the mind to the arms.

435
00:24:25,731 --> 00:24:29,150
And we can now read their thoughts
and control a prosthetic arm that will

436
00:24:29,151 --> 00:24:32,660
actually activate their wheelchair or
turn the channels on the TV or write

437
00:24:32,661 --> 00:24:36,680
emails for them or do everything that
they can do with the motor activity

438
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:39,350
themselves just by thinking
their thoughts in their mind.

439
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:44,240
And you can also do the most interesting
thing that I could think of in terms of

440
00:24:44,241 --> 00:24:47,630
gross hindsight now, which is decode
a personal start in real time.

441
00:24:47,631 --> 00:24:51,620
So our main work a few years ago was one
where we basically had patient sick in

442
00:24:51,621 --> 00:24:52,310
bed,

443
00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:56,780
think on one of multiple things that we
found earlier in the morning in their

444
00:24:56,781 --> 00:25:00,770
brain. Very Manilow, my contacts on
their mom, their dad, the Eiffel Tower,

445
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,570
anything we could find in
the morning in their brain.

446
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:05,990
And we can just decode their projector
thoughts on a screen in front of their

447
00:25:05,991 --> 00:25:08,510
eyes.
Now what's mine?

448
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:11,570
What's we need to think about
that is first that we can do it,

449
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:16,600
but also that once they get to that we
can actually find how early can we tell

450
00:25:17,330 --> 00:25:18,650
what you're going to think.

451
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:23,720
And also at what point is your brain
taking those thoughts and making them into

452
00:25:23,721 --> 00:25:27,170
a conscious person. At what point does
your brain calling all of that reality?

453
00:25:27,710 --> 00:25:30,750
And the interesting thing is that it's
not obviously happening in realtime.

454
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:33,770
In fact, it doesn't happen necessarily
at all. So here's an example.

455
00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:37,580
Here's a picture that you are seeing.
It's kind of flickering.

456
00:25:37,610 --> 00:25:41,030
And I can tell you that your brain is
all of the upset of this picture and it

457
00:25:41,031 --> 00:25:43,790
tends it. Something's not right
here. It just that you don't listen.

458
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:47,150
You're consciousness isn't
that we have it. So Eh,

459
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:50,360
what you see here is actually
not just one but two pictures.

460
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:55,840
They alternate and there's one aspect
of the picture that keeps changing and

461
00:25:56,241 --> 00:26:00,260
coming back. And I can tell you that
your brain's all seat in your brain.

462
00:26:00,270 --> 00:26:03,650
There's a salad right now,
fires and stops and fire that stops.

463
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:05,300
It just doesn't tell your consciousness.

464
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:07,280
Try to see if we can raise
your hand if you can say it.

465
00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:10,610
Don't say or just raise your hand. So
those of you who don't say it right now,

466
00:26:10,611 --> 00:26:13,700
get nervous. You're starting to scan
the picture from a top to bottom,

467
00:26:13,701 --> 00:26:17,090
left to right. Maybe the Canada flag.
Maybe it's the shadow of the soldiers.

468
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:20,360
You count the soldiers, you look at
the number of windows on the airplane.

469
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:22,880
It's the engineering center pointed out.

470
00:26:27,230 --> 00:26:30,590
The good thing is that if you've,
once you've seen it right now,

471
00:26:30,591 --> 00:26:32,510
you can never not see it. This
is it. It's one time learning.

472
00:26:32,511 --> 00:26:34,820
So for the rest of your life,
it's going to be in your brain right now.

473
00:26:35,870 --> 00:26:39,470
And what's interesting beyond the fact
that it's a cool experiment is the idea

474
00:26:39,471 --> 00:26:44,220
that in your brain there is some cells
that code engines and cells were firing

475
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:47,150
and stopping and fire something all
the time. It's just, it's somewhere.

476
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:50,040
It didn't bubble up into
your consciousness and you,
even though you wanted it,

477
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,710
couldn't get the part of your brain,
the toilets to give it to you.

478
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:56,320
So somewhere in your brain there was a
gap between who knows the answer and who

479
00:26:56,321 --> 00:26:58,080
is actually in control.
I'm sorry, not an example.

480
00:26:58,130 --> 00:27:01,590
So if you felt smarter than the first one,
you have a chance to try another one.

481
00:27:03,690 --> 00:27:04,680
Raise your hand when you say that.

482
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:07,550
Okay.

483
00:27:07,550 --> 00:27:12,120
It's funny as hell though. It seems to
people it actually correlates with Iq.

484
00:27:12,150 --> 00:27:15,950
If he didn't see both, eh, no, he
doesn't know what's going to Iq.

485
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:22,090
Okay. It's the leaves right
here. How do you hold her

486
00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:25,750
so we can go on and on with
them? Any of it. I was at temple,

487
00:27:25,751 --> 00:27:27,450
but the point is somewhere in your brain,

488
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:31,440
someone knows something and it doesn't
tell you no. If I know that this person,

489
00:27:31,441 --> 00:27:36,030
you'll bring saw something and I
can find in a gap, it's big enough.

490
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:39,210
I can actually not just fight
it out but also change things.

491
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:41,400
And what are we going,
we've got this one step further,

492
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:45,960
which is to see what happens if I change
something before the time you become

493
00:27:45,961 --> 00:27:48,990
aware of it and actually make you
have a different sense of reality.

494
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:50,570
So one of the things,
but these are patients will,

495
00:27:50,571 --> 00:27:54,480
we had them play a game or we said we're
gonna have you make simple choices.

496
00:27:54,690 --> 00:27:58,680
Again, the very basic we're giving them,
I wouldn't inbox me two big red buttons,

497
00:27:58,740 --> 00:27:59,850
one on the left,
one on the right.

498
00:27:59,851 --> 00:28:02,940
And we told them this next comment about
the making decisions for the next 20

499
00:28:02,941 --> 00:28:06,130
minutes. We asked you to just sit here
and whenever you feel like it's pressed,

500
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:10,950
the buttons on the left, on the right in
random order. So left, right, right, left,

501
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:13,590
left, right, left and so
on. Nothing important.

502
00:28:13,591 --> 00:28:16,120
Just make choices and we're going to
want to know how your brain looks on your

503
00:28:16,121 --> 00:28:20,310
decisions to go left or right.
That's it. But as always,

504
00:28:20,550 --> 00:28:24,630
there's a twist here. Does the patient,
by the way, because we care about choices,

505
00:28:24,930 --> 00:28:28,950
everything in press a button we're going
to turn the lights on for a second just

506
00:28:28,951 --> 00:28:31,950
to see the data from your brain.
This is what we know that we're saving.

507
00:28:32,370 --> 00:28:35,400
So when we're saving, please don't
touch anything. Wait for I to turn off.

508
00:28:35,401 --> 00:28:38,880
And then you can start on a toilet.
So important when the rights are own,

509
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,630
don't touch anything like
depression and start the game.

510
00:28:42,631 --> 00:28:44,250
And for the first maybe 50 trials,

511
00:28:44,310 --> 00:28:46,020
the patient just pressing the
buttons and we just leave it there.

512
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:49,530
Bring the community normally.
But after 50 trials also when we fill it,

513
00:28:49,531 --> 00:28:53,210
we can actually decode their thoughts
far before he or she will execute.

514
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:57,310
Think Damon, we actually starts the
real experiment. Well, if as times zero,

515
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:59,490
I know anything, four seconds
are going to press the buttons,

516
00:29:00,090 --> 00:29:03,450
I wait maybe like nine and
turned them on on their own.

517
00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:06,740
So when you press the buttons did I told
her the on and there's a big puzzle in

518
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:08,970
order to tell you what did you do?
You're just wanting to experiment.

519
00:29:08,971 --> 00:29:12,530
We don't even have to do one thing. Don't
touch [inaudible]. I'm so sorry doctor.

520
00:29:12,531 --> 00:29:13,410
What kind of happened by itself?

521
00:29:13,430 --> 00:29:15,600
Never mind you just throwing everything
that we're gonna start again and make

522
00:29:15,601 --> 00:29:16,530
sure you don't do it again.

523
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:21,300
What you see is this a unique
experience or the patient's experience,

524
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:27,270
what they want to happen. It's already
happened and they can try to move faster.

525
00:29:27,690 --> 00:29:29,760
They can try to kind of take us to go
to the right and they move to the next,

526
00:29:29,761 --> 00:29:31,170
but it doesn't matter.
I mean inside our head,

527
00:29:31,410 --> 00:29:34,530
as soon as they know I already know.
So here's kind of how it looks.

528
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:37,513
Okay.

529
00:29:56,810 --> 00:30:01,210
Remarkable is this kind of experience
that we all can think about but don't

530
00:30:01,211 --> 00:30:03,970
really believe. But when I tell you your
thoughts are known to me before you,

531
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:06,400
you kind of said that's cool,
but I don't really experience life.

532
00:30:06,401 --> 00:30:08,330
Like this week we called it
the illusion of free will.

533
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:10,660
We can talk about freewheeling,
let's look at here.

534
00:30:10,661 --> 00:30:13,600
But we actually believe that we're in
control and these patients for the first

535
00:30:13,601 --> 00:30:18,370
time have this unique experience that
they really feel this experience of not

536
00:30:18,371 --> 00:30:19,580
having control.
You go to the restaurant,

537
00:30:19,610 --> 00:30:23,650
you say there was dragging the menu
steak, Solomon in Salad and you, sorry,

538
00:30:23,670 --> 00:30:25,750
one thickness up and say, oh
sorry, we're out of felon.

539
00:30:25,810 --> 00:30:28,180
Oh I was about to say started.
Nevermind. I was talking like,

540
00:30:28,330 --> 00:30:29,550
oh there's no phenomenon.

541
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:32,440
So we basically eliminated things
from your life before you made them

542
00:30:33,970 --> 00:30:38,320
and this gives you this experience of
lack of control in a very unique way.

543
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:39,790
Which no,
we tried to extend the psychology.

544
00:30:39,791 --> 00:30:41,410
What's interesting here
actually isn't debt.

545
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:43,090
What's interesting is what happens next.

546
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:46,720
So the fact that I can actually
change things into all that before you

547
00:30:46,721 --> 00:30:50,110
experienced them because I know them
early is cool, but that's surprising.

548
00:30:50,111 --> 00:30:51,820
Once I find a stones,
I can do whatever I want.

549
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:54,880
What actually is interesting is if we
can do something even more complex.

550
00:30:55,090 --> 00:30:58,540
So I know at times zeal that in four
seconds are going to press the button.

551
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:04,150
I can wait 3.9 seconds, but I can also
turn the lights on as soon as I know it.

552
00:31:04,570 --> 00:31:06,100
And if I turn the lights
on when I know it,

553
00:31:06,370 --> 00:31:10,750
it's so early that you don't even know
that you were about to know something.

554
00:31:10,990 --> 00:31:11,741
And in fact,
what happened,

555
00:31:11,741 --> 00:31:15,790
his mission sit there and see
lights turning on off on off,

556
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,460
and they have no understanding of
why those lights turn on and off.

557
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:21,130
He doesn't know that it's their brain
who wanted it because the light's shining

558
00:31:21,131 --> 00:31:23,350
on it actually stops your
brain from experiencing it.

559
00:31:23,830 --> 00:31:26,080
But there are brain knows it
because it said the signal.

560
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:29,230
So what happens is that there was actually
our conversation here between me and

561
00:31:29,231 --> 00:31:32,110
their brain behind her back
and we know that it's still,

562
00:31:32,111 --> 00:31:35,650
because at some point the cells in their
brain stops functioning because they

563
00:31:35,651 --> 00:31:39,490
kind of see that they said action to be
happening and it didn't happen multiple

564
00:31:39,491 --> 00:31:42,490
times and he just thinks something
doesn't work and this will tend to go back

565
00:31:42,491 --> 00:31:42,970
afterwards.

566
00:31:42,970 --> 00:31:46,390
So there's a unique opportunity here
to speak to someone as being behind her

567
00:31:46,391 --> 00:31:50,350
back and really get a sense of the
person and their unconscious mind.

568
00:31:50,351 --> 00:31:54,370
And the reason it's interesting is because
when the of life through the part of

569
00:31:54,371 --> 00:31:58,270
their brain that to the contrast spots,
then we call this me, we think this is us,

570
00:31:58,630 --> 00:32:02,610
and now for the first time we can actually
give those patients access to bottom

571
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:04,480
turn, bring that they
normally have no control over.

572
00:32:04,930 --> 00:32:08,770
Most of our brain is actually not under
our control. When you see the world,

573
00:32:09,490 --> 00:32:11,500
it's already in the coral.
Some bottom,

574
00:32:11,501 --> 00:32:15,990
your brain had to add Niccolo decode
shapes and orientations and when you seek

575
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,610
it's all can call in. If I tell you,
please make the wall black and white,

576
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:22,030
you can't do that. Even though your
brain has the capacity to change Colo,

577
00:32:22,210 --> 00:32:25,190
you can't really turn it off because it's
happening under the hood in Pleasanton,

578
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:30,130
they have no access to different things
that are more accessible to us. Oh,

579
00:32:30,131 --> 00:32:31,930
file from our controller emotions.

580
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:34,470
Emotions are something you
can actually kind of control.

581
00:32:34,490 --> 00:32:37,310
You have some access to them, but they
don't really fully under your control.

582
00:32:37,311 --> 00:32:40,730
You can, you don't. So you know,
my mom is sick. I want to feel sad,

583
00:32:40,731 --> 00:32:44,810
I'm going to activate [inaudible]
now. Okay. The acclimates
sadness, it's kind of,

584
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:48,620
it's not working like this. They don't
know us. We can control the inputs,

585
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:51,620
but at the same time the emotions
happen and we kind of witnesses to them.

586
00:32:52,010 --> 00:32:53,450
Now with these patients for
the first time he used to be,

587
00:32:53,451 --> 00:32:56,870
you can actually put electrodes in
those places where Carlos had Brandon,

588
00:32:57,180 --> 00:32:58,190
we're emotions happen,

589
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:02,510
we're breathing happen and teach them
how to control their brain in a different

590
00:33:02,511 --> 00:33:03,051
experience.

591
00:33:03,051 --> 00:33:05,900
So we have now works where we teach
patients how to control their emotions.

592
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:07,770
We put the records in their
emotional part of the brain.

593
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:09,020
We tell them using feedback.

594
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:12,350
That's something that they did right now
actually send a feedback to the emotion

595
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:15,110
dilemma.
Now learn how to control your fear.

596
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:18,440
So you want to feel afraid or actually
feel afraid and just change the levels.

597
00:33:19,370 --> 00:33:22,520
We can actually control them,
let them control their breathing.

598
00:33:22,970 --> 00:33:27,380
So up to now we define a person is alive
or dead by looking at part of the brain

599
00:33:27,381 --> 00:33:28,940
that control their breathing.
And if it's not active,

600
00:33:28,941 --> 00:33:31,400
we call this person did with our
patients and one of our works,

601
00:33:31,401 --> 00:33:34,370
we can actually teach them how to move
the control of their breathing to a

602
00:33:34,371 --> 00:33:37,100
different parts of their brain. So they
seem like they're dead in many ways,

603
00:33:37,101 --> 00:33:39,110
but actually you're just controlling
their relief on different spots.

604
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:43,130
And the idea is that now we
unlock a lot more of our brain.

605
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:47,210
One of our brain is active
but only a swap offender.

606
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:48,740
It is under our control and now we don't,

607
00:33:48,741 --> 00:33:51,350
the records that we put in different
places plus fitbit from those places,

608
00:33:51,351 --> 00:33:53,990
we can actually teach people
how to control them. Okay.

609
00:33:54,710 --> 00:33:58,670
So I want to a use also the last five
minutes to talk about something inspiring.

610
00:33:58,671 --> 00:34:03,671
And for that I have to connect our work
to what we're doing right now and where

611
00:34:03,801 --> 00:34:06,890
I think it's heading first.
A little bit of history.

612
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:12,280
So October 28 2010 is when the work I
mentioned to you right now came to life as

613
00:34:12,491 --> 00:34:13,324
they can be published it.

614
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:16,580
It was published in a very high
profile journal Academic Journal.

615
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:19,100
And because of that, a lot of people
in the world cared about our work.

616
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:21,140
And journalists called me and
asked me a question about it.

617
00:34:21,141 --> 00:34:24,950
Then one of them was a journalist
for BBC England who said,

618
00:34:24,951 --> 00:34:28,340
we're really curious about how you can a
project people's thoughts on the screen,

619
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:31,940
Eh, tell me about that. And nice explain
their work a little bit. And then he says,

620
00:34:32,150 --> 00:34:35,630
Eh, what else can you do with it? Like
if you can protect someone starts,

621
00:34:35,770 --> 00:34:39,140
can you project her emotions and a
screen or maybe their memories or their

622
00:34:39,141 --> 00:34:41,960
dreams. And I say, Eh, in theory
it's possible. Thank you. Bye.

623
00:34:42,590 --> 00:34:45,230
So the other thing that happened was that
I told someone from RBC that it didn't

624
00:34:45,231 --> 00:34:49,400
make coding. It's possible
in theory. However,

625
00:34:49,401 --> 00:34:53,770
the theory was lost quickly
in the headline and before
long the title was doing,

626
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:58,040
my calling is possible. And they were
still kind of a quotation mark making.

627
00:34:58,041 --> 00:35:00,860
It's seemingly a maybe possible,

628
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:03,740
but this didn't stay with
quotations mark very long,

629
00:35:03,950 --> 00:35:06,980
about five minutes into the word,
the moment our work came out,

630
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:09,830
the entire world was up in arms about the
fact of scientists that according your

631
00:35:09,831 --> 00:35:13,580
dreams in quickly, Eh, not
just the coding your dreams,

632
00:35:13,581 --> 00:35:15,920
but there were questions
about how we do that.

633
00:35:15,950 --> 00:35:19,940
In how long have we been doing that? Eh,
Eh, people father calling me and saying

634
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:25,140
they want to subpoena me because I've
been involved with the approach by the CIA

635
00:35:25,141 --> 00:35:27,960
to recall their dreams for
the last couple of years. Eh,

636
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:31,220
people call me and ask me if I can look
at their spouses dreams. A lot of that,

637
00:35:31,550 --> 00:35:33,500
eh,
there were,

638
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:36,710
there was actually a chef not far from
here who is a famous chef in New York who

639
00:35:36,711 --> 00:35:40,380
said that he's been dreaming of a recipe
for years now and he wants me to put

640
00:35:40,381 --> 00:35:44,280
the records in his brain and
extract them. Eh, big Eh,

641
00:35:44,430 --> 00:35:47,370
operating system company called us and
wanted to option the billing coding

642
00:35:47,371 --> 00:35:51,660
machine, Eh, in the next hour west.
And when I told them they don't exist,

643
00:35:51,930 --> 00:35:55,600
they said, I'm playing how to get in
there. You're going to build her own. Eh,

644
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:59,490
there were a websites and Wikipedia
pages for the democratic machine and the

645
00:35:59,491 --> 00:36:02,730
word was excited about this thing.
This was in fact for a few days.

646
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:06,060
The number one, Eh, you know,
story on science and tech,

647
00:36:06,490 --> 00:36:08,460
let coding and despite me saying everyone,

648
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:12,380
it's impossible story and a life of
its own. I was pretty fascinated,

649
00:36:12,381 --> 00:36:14,160
as you can imagine from this thing.

650
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:16,500
I called my dad who is a
journalist and I said, dad,

651
00:36:16,530 --> 00:36:19,230
how do you kill a stoic and said son,
no one cares about science.

652
00:36:19,231 --> 00:36:22,380
Just turn off the phone and wait. It's
going to die on its own. It didn't,

653
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:26,270
it didn't happen where the story,
because I didn't take a course, eh,

654
00:36:26,610 --> 00:36:30,010
just came via email and a lot more
attention was given to it. Attract,

655
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:31,650
might not answering,
just made it worse.

656
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:35,760
The worst thing I did was because it
was it. It came out in 20 October,

657
00:36:35,761 --> 00:36:37,770
28 three days after it was Halloween.

658
00:36:37,950 --> 00:36:41,250
My students had the idea that we're going
to go to a Halloween party and I had

659
00:36:41,251 --> 00:36:45,390
the idea to make a joke of this
and dress up like a zig won't void.

660
00:36:46,290 --> 00:36:50,190
So this, you know, this is days
of a really massive sharing.

661
00:36:50,191 --> 00:36:53,580
The picture came out and now there was
not just like a headline but also a

662
00:36:53,581 --> 00:36:55,520
picture of me looking
at, it goes on and, and,

663
00:36:55,700 --> 00:37:00,330
and this was the kind of a in my life
for about two weeks as a career killing

664
00:37:00,331 --> 00:37:01,164
experience.

665
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:07,050
But what was interesting is that I spent
a lot of time talking to the news and

666
00:37:07,051 --> 00:37:10,020
explain to everyone that the recording
is impossible and that we didn't do it.

667
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:13,260
And it's not really a how our work
could be done because we only looked at

668
00:37:13,261 --> 00:37:16,890
patients when they were awake and
nothing could work when they're sleeping.

669
00:37:18,150 --> 00:37:23,150
And this story actually died when Prince
William proposed to his girlfriend.

670
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:24,870
And this was the
commercial important thing.

671
00:37:25,170 --> 00:37:30,170
And it was out of my life for a number
of years until one day in April of 2013 I

672
00:37:31,141 --> 00:37:35,390
got a call from BBC again and they asked
me to a comment again on when we called

673
00:37:35,391 --> 00:37:39,870
him, I said, Eh, you've been to
it before. You know it's not true.

674
00:37:39,871 --> 00:37:42,380
And like this is the time to actually
correct the mistake. And they said, wait,

675
00:37:42,381 --> 00:37:43,950
wait, stop. We know
that you didn't do that,

676
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:47,490
but we actually want to commit to the
work of you can come a tiny from Japan or

677
00:37:47,491 --> 00:37:50,790
did it. So it turns out that a group in
Japan didn't know that it's impossible.

678
00:37:51,250 --> 00:37:53,850
And they just saw that someone did it
and they just follow up on our work.

679
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:57,620
They actually eh one or to improve on
the same technique that we didn't use.

680
00:37:58,050 --> 00:38:01,110
And they were the first guys to
do what we said was impossible.

681
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:03,190
They were the first guy I
spoke to, the core, the dreams,

682
00:38:03,350 --> 00:38:07,900
they in a technique that was developed
in Berkeley by a guy called Jack Golan to

683
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:10,120
basically the idea is that
you put electrodes, Eh,

684
00:38:10,530 --> 00:38:13,600
next part of her brain that
decode visual activities.

685
00:38:13,601 --> 00:38:17,220
So not really the thoughts like we do,
not the wall, but just lines and shapes.

686
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:20,550
And they essentially,
when people were awake,

687
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:23,970
looked at their brain activity and in
the back and we are that they could

688
00:38:23,971 --> 00:38:27,630
actually be code on the left is a
movie that people were watching.

689
00:38:27,631 --> 00:38:30,960
And on the right is what the computer
suggests, Eh, the person who will sing.

690
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:32,880
And this was done using Fmla,

691
00:38:32,881 --> 00:38:37,320
which is a much more crude tool than the
one we use. Instead of looking at all,

692
00:38:37,330 --> 00:38:41,410
you would see a person or you
would see a woman. That's about it.

693
00:38:41,590 --> 00:38:45,670
But the idea is that the hoop in Japan
could actually have people go to a

694
00:38:45,671 --> 00:38:49,500
scanner and sit, lie down, lie down
there while their brain is being scanned.

695
00:38:49,990 --> 00:38:52,060
And fortunately from my experience,

696
00:38:52,061 --> 00:38:55,210
a undergrads tend to fall asleep
in every study that you could them.

697
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:57,670
So it was very hard to get
them to fall asleep in the lab.

698
00:38:58,180 --> 00:38:59,013
And when they fall asleep,

699
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:02,060
a computer basically looks at their
brain activity and trying to decode eh,

700
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:06,490
one of a small number above categories.
Is it text? Is it an object?

701
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:07,333
Is the person.

702
00:39:07,510 --> 00:39:11,810
And we turn out to be pretty good in
being able to then wake up the tension and

703
00:39:11,830 --> 00:39:16,480
as the person telling me what you think
you dragged over and get a sense of the

704
00:39:16,481 --> 00:39:19,630
narrative if you want, or at least our
kind of gist of what they're doing.

705
00:39:19,630 --> 00:39:22,600
And this unlocks one of the coolest,
I think,

706
00:39:22,601 --> 00:39:26,980
think in a human experiments.
And the idea of looking inside creams.

707
00:39:27,730 --> 00:39:30,820
Now Dreams, they're fascinated
by humans for the last, you know,

708
00:39:31,210 --> 00:39:33,880
mean for Millennia.
And not only are the fascinating,

709
00:39:33,881 --> 00:39:38,360
but they also are in our mind, the
kind of access to our soul. You know,

710
00:39:38,370 --> 00:39:41,500
if you wake up and you tell
your girlfriend that you
had a dream about your ex

711
00:39:41,501 --> 00:39:45,160
girlfriend, she's gonna be upset with
your awake self. And you can say, no,

712
00:39:45,161 --> 00:39:48,280
it was my brain created this movie.
I'm not responsible. Somehow we get,

713
00:39:48,310 --> 00:39:52,390
we get blamed for our brains
in movies and in that sense,

714
00:39:52,570 --> 00:39:55,630
whether it's true or not, we all
think of dreams mean a lot. Eh?

715
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:58,690
There is entire set of professions
that tried to interpret dreams.

716
00:39:58,730 --> 00:40:03,490
The psychiatrist who spend a psychologist
spend days on couches with the people

717
00:40:03,610 --> 00:40:07,270
trying to have them tell their
stories and a lot of it is there.

718
00:40:07,270 --> 00:40:09,650
It means something or not.
We don't know the full understanding,

719
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:12,610
but for the first time and just the way
we can actually code debt and that's the

720
00:40:12,611 --> 00:40:15,400
American one because up to now we
are to rely on your awake self.

721
00:40:15,530 --> 00:40:19,090
The tell us the story of your living
stuff and we know that [inaudible] not

722
00:40:19,091 --> 00:40:22,270
aligned. We know that the language you
use to tell your dreams, for instance,

723
00:40:22,271 --> 00:40:25,510
the language of your wake self. If
you're blind, when you're awake,

724
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:29,920
you surely we tell your story as if
your dreams were not with visuals.

725
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:35,080
Eh, in the 1930s people would discard
our drinks in black and white.

726
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:39,100
Only when TV and film started have
Carlos did people start discovering their

727
00:40:39,101 --> 00:40:42,850
dreams in Cordele because somehow
in their mind a dream is a movie.

728
00:40:43,030 --> 00:40:44,110
And so whatever it was,

729
00:40:44,170 --> 00:40:46,300
movies in their mind that is how
they discovered their dreams,

730
00:40:46,301 --> 00:40:49,990
which means that whatever we have is
awake people is the language we use to

731
00:40:49,991 --> 00:40:54,640
charge dreams.
And this is unreliable and for many,

732
00:40:54,641 --> 00:40:58,630
many decades we couldn't really know
what's going on in your dreams because we

733
00:40:58,631 --> 00:41:01,390
only had their wake self.
And now for the first time in history,

734
00:41:01,391 --> 00:41:04,540
you can actually look at your
dreams and a actually the code,

735
00:41:04,541 --> 00:41:09,400
the content and compare first what your
brain tells me happened in your side and

736
00:41:09,401 --> 00:41:09,941
what you say,

737
00:41:09,941 --> 00:41:13,390
but also get access to something that
you might've forgotten when you woke up.

738
00:41:13,990 --> 00:41:17,470
And this isn't just a cool thing that
allows us to actually project dreams and

739
00:41:17,471 --> 00:41:20,260
tell you the story that you had in mind
and see how they aligned to what it is.

740
00:41:20,410 --> 00:41:23,290
It also allows us to
change behavior because Eh,

741
00:41:23,350 --> 00:41:27,670
what we learned in the last three
years is that when you're sleeping,

742
00:41:27,671 --> 00:41:32,180
your brain isn't just resting.
It's actually overworking
if you want one thing,

743
00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:32,681
a lot of things,

744
00:41:32,681 --> 00:41:37,681
and one of those things is actually
choosing behaviors to get once to save and

745
00:41:37,941 --> 00:41:40,550
what I would want to eliminate so that
when you wake up you have a different

746
00:41:40,551 --> 00:41:44,390
story to craft and if you go back to the
beginning when I told you that or our

747
00:41:44,391 --> 00:41:49,391
consciousness does is taking memories
and building them into a narrative.

748
00:41:50,570 --> 00:41:51,710
Now we know when it happens.

749
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:56,360
We know that at some point during the
night there's a window of time that

750
00:41:56,361 --> 00:41:59,390
happens every 90 minutes where your
brain essentially looks at all of the

751
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:03,200
memories it has from the day and
choose which ones to encapsulate,

752
00:42:03,650 --> 00:42:04,730
which ones to eliminate.

753
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:07,400
And if we got to the point of
this moment in change something,

754
00:42:07,401 --> 00:42:09,800
we can actually create a new
memory so that when you wake up,

755
00:42:09,801 --> 00:42:12,560
you're going to build into a
narrative and change your behavior,

756
00:42:13,490 --> 00:42:15,260
not just a POA.

757
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:18,710
In one of their studies at my
colleague did in a few ones,

758
00:42:18,711 --> 00:42:22,850
like a few years ago in 2015 she took
smokers who come to the Lebanon and I'll

759
00:42:22,851 --> 00:42:26,090
ask to take a nap. That's all. They don't
tell anything. They got to take a nap.

760
00:42:26,330 --> 00:42:28,010
And when they get to the specific window,

761
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:31,190
when your brain essentially
assesses what's important in life,

762
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:33,620
she sprayed the smell of
nicotine into their nose,

763
00:42:33,980 --> 00:42:38,150
making their brain focused right
now on smoking as a thought and then

764
00:42:38,151 --> 00:42:39,950
immediately just spray
the smell of organ eggs,

765
00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:43,550
which is a smell that's known
to scientists to actually
benefit your brain and

766
00:42:43,820 --> 00:42:46,340
make you have a variety of
response without waking up.

767
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:48,770
So she pairs in this person's brain,

768
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:52,550
the idea of nicotine and bad experiences
multiple time in different kinds of

769
00:42:52,551 --> 00:42:54,590
patients. And when the person
wakes up after two hours,

770
00:42:54,710 --> 00:42:56,210
not only do they not know what happened,

771
00:42:56,510 --> 00:42:58,400
they actually think that
it was just a regular neck,

772
00:42:59,450 --> 00:43:04,450
but there are brain internalized the
conditioning and for the week after they

773
00:43:04,551 --> 00:43:08,270
actually don't smoke or smoke very little
functional. It goes back afterwards.

774
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:10,520
So we didn't find the
solution to check it entirely.

775
00:43:10,670 --> 00:43:14,720
But if find a way to start teaching
your brain things that you will actually

776
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:17,360
live by afterwards without
knowing what happened.

777
00:43:17,660 --> 00:43:20,510
And of course I have to try right now
to do it repeatedly and see if it's a

778
00:43:20,511 --> 00:43:24,350
stance data most strongly and see if it
actually change the, we agree entirely,

779
00:43:24,351 --> 00:43:28,010
but now we know when your brain
actually stores and creates memories.

780
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:30,740
Then if we come in
between and change things,

781
00:43:30,830 --> 00:43:34,130
you're going to do the work for us
in making those into a narrative,

782
00:43:34,250 --> 00:43:35,630
a contrast for search of yourself,

783
00:43:35,631 --> 00:43:39,320
never spoken or never been in this room
with us and then you will actually use

784
00:43:39,321 --> 00:43:42,710
that to tell a different story of herself.
Okay,

785
00:43:43,130 --> 00:43:48,130
so why am I telling you all of that and
we just about to end because we kind of

786
00:43:51,651 --> 00:43:53,600
unlocked the meaning of the thoughts.

787
00:43:53,630 --> 00:43:56,090
We know the code of a thought and we
know how to find them in your brain.

788
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:59,570
We're now able to map them and we're
able to project them into outside and

789
00:43:59,571 --> 00:44:02,840
actually use that to get access to what
you're about to do before you do that.

790
00:44:03,170 --> 00:44:04,003
That's pretty cool.

791
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:08,210
We can also look at that
in specific moments in your
life and change things that

792
00:44:08,211 --> 00:44:09,170
are under the hood.

793
00:44:09,260 --> 00:44:12,620
So you will only experience them after
the fact and just defend them as if they

794
00:44:12,621 --> 00:44:14,930
were your thoughts and live
a life that aligns with them.

795
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:19,100
And we now can use it to even look at
your brain and change your behavior in a

796
00:44:19,101 --> 00:44:23,120
massive way such that you will actually
stop all kinds of behaviors that you

797
00:44:23,121 --> 00:44:23,780
don't like.

798
00:44:23,780 --> 00:44:27,380
And now we're playing with the idea of
actually coding dreams into your mind and

799
00:44:27,381 --> 00:44:30,530
actually going inside and making a story
that for you so you can actually go to

800
00:44:30,531 --> 00:44:32,670
sleep and the infant
Spielberg and you know,

801
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:35,880
have a dream or actually seeing
if we can align people's dreams.

802
00:44:36,210 --> 00:44:38,910
So take two people who sleep side by
side and actually make sure that they

803
00:44:38,911 --> 00:44:40,620
actually have somehow related to them.

804
00:44:40,621 --> 00:44:42,990
So you go on a date and you can be
calm and in the day doesn't end.

805
00:44:42,991 --> 00:44:44,730
You actually continued to drink together.

806
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:49,140
Or the ultimate goal of this work is to
try to see if I can actually teach you

807
00:44:49,141 --> 00:44:50,160
new things when you're dreaming.

808
00:44:50,161 --> 00:44:53,460
So you can go to sleep and wake
up [inaudible] not working so far,

809
00:44:54,090 --> 00:44:57,840
but besides all of that lies the coolest
thing in which I'm going to end with it.

810
00:44:57,841 --> 00:45:02,700
I started with that when I'm finished
with that is the idea that we now actually

811
00:45:02,701 --> 00:45:06,780
change the center of the
locus of control in our brain.

812
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:12,450
So we live life like the
character from the King Kong,

813
00:45:12,550 --> 00:45:17,550
Eh should con game earlier thinking that
we're controlling the character and we

814
00:45:17,671 --> 00:45:19,770
give more and more evidence
to people that were not.

815
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:20,640
But it doesn't change anything.

816
00:45:20,641 --> 00:45:24,840
We still think that we're in control and
it's because it's hard for us to change

817
00:45:24,841 --> 00:45:28,050
this. It's hard for us to accept the
fact that my brain has component and make

818
00:45:28,051 --> 00:45:31,230
decisions and I am aware of those only
after the fact and just explain them.

819
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:33,970
But there's a good analogy
here that I really liked it.

820
00:45:33,980 --> 00:45:36,570
It allows me to at least
accept it partially.

821
00:45:36,780 --> 00:45:38,430
And I think that if you follow this,

822
00:45:38,460 --> 00:45:41,550
if you just accept this
partial understanding that
I'm suggesting right now,

823
00:45:41,580 --> 00:45:42,780
it will help you in the future.

824
00:45:42,781 --> 00:45:45,050
And then we can take your questions
about how it can actually implement that.

825
00:45:45,790 --> 00:45:50,790
And this is analogy from 408 years ago
when they logo lea pointed his telescope

826
00:45:52,830 --> 00:45:55,740
to the moons of Jupiter and
tried to observe the orbit.

827
00:45:56,010 --> 00:46:00,030
What he saw was that the
planets were not orbiting, Eh,

828
00:46:00,060 --> 00:46:03,090
the moods want orbiting the
way he thought they should go.

829
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:06,510
And the only way to explain this was to
change the entire making some sort of

830
00:46:06,511 --> 00:46:10,620
system and put the sun in the center and
Earth as the third planet from center.

831
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:16,400
Now this to him felt like
a failure of society.

832
00:46:16,501 --> 00:46:18,360
What does it mean that
we're not of the universe?

833
00:46:18,361 --> 00:46:20,880
What does it mean that we're not the
most important thing in the world?

834
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:22,800
But once he accepted it,

835
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:27,000
he was able to see far outside of what
we thought the world was before he could

836
00:46:27,001 --> 00:46:30,420
see fall outside into the
wide reaches of the universe.

837
00:46:31,830 --> 00:46:33,060
And in the 400 years to follow,

838
00:46:33,061 --> 00:46:37,140
we were able to explore the big universe
and see a lot more of what's out there

839
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:39,060
now in the same way in the last 10 years,

840
00:46:39,470 --> 00:46:43,360
being as understand that we're not
the center of our old universe,

841
00:46:43,390 --> 00:46:46,620
that in our own head there are many,
many planets. If you want many voices,

842
00:46:46,900 --> 00:46:49,770
then the one we speak with is
not the most important one.

843
00:46:49,830 --> 00:46:52,620
It's just the one we call us because
it's the one we have most control over.

844
00:46:53,210 --> 00:46:55,410
And if you begin to understand that
there's other voices there and that we can

845
00:46:55,411 --> 00:46:59,460
actually give access to those voices
using electrodes or using other methods,

846
00:46:59,790 --> 00:47:03,420
we can actually uncover more of what's
in your brain and tell you what your

847
00:47:03,421 --> 00:47:07,800
dreams mean, what's your choices
mean, how you are with them and so on.

848
00:47:08,490 --> 00:47:09,101
And in that sense.

849
00:47:09,101 --> 00:47:12,720
So we're not only going to uncover the
mysteries of the brain are going to

850
00:47:12,721 --> 00:47:16,860
understand the most interesting
thing in the universe, which is us.

851
00:47:17,610 --> 00:47:18,443
Thank you.

852
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:24,120
[inaudible].

853
00:47:27,750 --> 00:47:32,200
So now we can talk about it if you
don't have your net on business or on

854
00:47:32,201 --> 00:47:34,030
anything that Eh,
I want,

855
00:47:34,031 --> 00:47:38,290
which is to convince you that there's a
need for people with the understanding

856
00:47:38,291 --> 00:47:42,480
of a machine learning and
coding in this field fill.

857
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:44,660
I made it seem easy. It just like
listening to the brain. I can do it too.

858
00:47:44,661 --> 00:47:46,960
But the reality is that most of
the problems we have right now, uh,

859
00:47:47,140 --> 00:47:50,350
just time series that we need to decode.

860
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:52,580
We know that something happening in the
Isla molded the Brandon was coding it.

861
00:47:52,810 --> 00:47:56,050
Want to know what connects what. So
there's a wolf or a lot of knowledge here.

862
00:47:56,470 --> 00:47:57,430
Questions.
Yes.

863
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:02,160
Well there's, there's a ton.
Um, I have two actually.

864
00:48:02,430 --> 00:48:04,320
One is may be simply to answer.

865
00:48:04,321 --> 00:48:09,321
It seems to me that there's a huge need
for enhanced resolution with noninvasive

866
00:48:10,891 --> 00:48:15,030
mechanisms. Is there, can
you tell us something about
latest developments in that?

867
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:16,160
Sure.
So there,

868
00:48:16,170 --> 00:48:21,060
there is a big movement right now on
the tries to basically use these results

869
00:48:21,510 --> 00:48:24,180
and make things that go into
your brain control them.

870
00:48:24,181 --> 00:48:27,780
You probably heard about Brian Johnson
and Elan Musk trying to eh, eh, go there.

871
00:48:28,230 --> 00:48:31,020
Generally we want to poke
into our brain control things.

872
00:48:31,380 --> 00:48:34,350
The problem is that the only way we know
to retinal break right now is to dig a

873
00:48:34,351 --> 00:48:36,360
hole in it,
in and get inside.

874
00:48:36,361 --> 00:48:39,030
And this is not something
that you all can try at home.

875
00:48:39,510 --> 00:48:43,290
So the science of that is pretty easy.
Look, we know the language of the brain,

876
00:48:43,291 --> 00:48:44,070
we know how to do it.

877
00:48:44,070 --> 00:48:49,070
The question is how do we get inside the
leading technique right now that people

878
00:48:49,351 --> 00:48:53,970
look into is ingestible trying to create
pills that you will swallow and they

879
00:48:53,971 --> 00:48:57,960
will travel inside your
blood brain barrier and get
to your brain and live there

880
00:48:58,410 --> 00:49:01,410
and do things for you permanently.

881
00:49:01,770 --> 00:49:05,070
So we know what a great viruses that
go into to take cells and live there.

882
00:49:05,430 --> 00:49:08,700
And we tried to find
the same way with pills.

883
00:49:09,150 --> 00:49:13,680
It's raising all the ethical
questions and so on. And it also, Eh,

884
00:49:14,070 --> 00:49:16,530
I'm going to make prediction. I'll tell
you how I think is going to work out.

885
00:49:17,190 --> 00:49:21,840
One in Silicon Valley rich guy is going
to just poke a hole inside his or her

886
00:49:23,220 --> 00:49:28,220
brain and stick a chip inside that will
collect their thoughts straight to the

887
00:49:29,911 --> 00:49:33,030
worldwide web and this would
allow them to have advantages.

888
00:49:33,060 --> 00:49:35,550
They would do high frequency
trading inside our head faster.

889
00:49:35,551 --> 00:49:37,860
They would this solve math problems
faster than their play chess.

890
00:49:37,861 --> 00:49:38,940
Better than you because
they have accident,

891
00:49:38,941 --> 00:49:41,940
die world and everyone's going to
think they're insane for doing that,

892
00:49:42,330 --> 00:49:43,980
but then they're going to think,
oh, they have an advantage,

893
00:49:43,981 --> 00:49:47,010
actually do the same and within a few
years it's going to become widespread.

894
00:49:47,010 --> 00:49:48,870
Anyone's going to do it himself
and then become mainstream.

895
00:49:49,080 --> 00:49:52,530
It's not entirely science fiction.
It happened.

896
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:57,600
It'd be four in the 50s or forties I
think the idea of a putting a silicon

897
00:49:57,660 --> 00:49:59,910
inside your breasts seemed
like outrageous idea.

898
00:49:59,911 --> 00:50:02,520
Who's going to put something inside of
her breasts? I think that right now,

899
00:50:02,521 --> 00:50:05,730
what is 70 years later,
one of four American girls,

900
00:50:05,731 --> 00:50:09,240
age 16 asks for a breast implants
when she turned 16 birthday.

901
00:50:09,390 --> 00:50:11,880
So I think it's quick from the moment
someone does it and it looks great.

902
00:50:11,910 --> 00:50:15,240
At the moment, we actually all accepted.
So that's my prediction. Very few,

903
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:18,370
very soon in people bring,
it's like a question then we take.

904
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:23,790
So sorry, I'm just really,
really want to ask this. Um,

905
00:50:24,460 --> 00:50:28,240
so it seems to me that a lot
of the studies you've, uh,

906
00:50:28,260 --> 00:50:32,900
an experience you've described deal
with decisions that are not very

907
00:50:32,901 --> 00:50:37,901
consequential or to destroy it differently
that people do not have a conscious,

908
00:50:38,290 --> 00:50:42,080
uh, interest in modifying. So,

909
00:50:42,081 --> 00:50:43,850
and this and this kind of,
you know,

910
00:50:43,851 --> 00:50:47,030
thinking about this makes me think about
thinking fast and slow and you know,

911
00:50:47,031 --> 00:50:49,440
it doesn't seem like
their executive function,

912
00:50:49,441 --> 00:50:52,160
the prefontal cortex were involved there,

913
00:50:52,220 --> 00:50:55,310
or at least that they
tried to initiate them.

914
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:58,010
So this description of you,

915
00:50:58,100 --> 00:51:02,870
a living as a bystander to decisions
that are already made seems to be to be

916
00:51:02,871 --> 00:51:07,100
like a partial description of reality,
the flex to certain things,

917
00:51:07,490 --> 00:51:11,560
but that you're probably able to
regain control if you apply, uh,

918
00:51:11,630 --> 00:51:14,340
other parts of your brain to cause that's,
that's correctly.

919
00:51:14,420 --> 00:51:15,500
What can you tell us about that

920
00:51:15,930 --> 00:51:16,840
up to now?
We forget.

921
00:51:16,870 --> 00:51:21,380
We've tried to train a simple things
like and when we try even behavior,

922
00:51:21,390 --> 00:51:26,100
you can change your wife and you pick
the one you liked it more when you pick

923
00:51:26,101 --> 00:51:28,140
your wife and we'd give you somewhere
else you would notice right away.

924
00:51:28,890 --> 00:51:31,890
So it doesn't work. We did cross
sectional choices on the behavioral about.

925
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:35,220
However, the smoking experiment is
indicative of the fact that they actually,

926
00:51:35,221 --> 00:51:39,120
we can change behaviors that were at
least, Eh, something that you were doing.

927
00:51:39,170 --> 00:51:40,003
I mean,
surely.

928
00:51:40,050 --> 00:51:43,440
So smoking experiment that we now have
one where we tried to make people eat

929
00:51:43,510 --> 00:51:45,510
healthier, getting to go
to sleep, they can nap.

930
00:51:45,690 --> 00:51:49,740
We essentially activate the flavor or
farther in their brain when you wake up,

931
00:51:49,741 --> 00:51:52,470
we say, here's a buffet. She's like,
you want? And they choose themselves,

932
00:51:52,471 --> 00:51:53,304
could eat healthy.

933
00:51:53,340 --> 00:51:57,630
This is starting to go in a realm that
is a little bit more like real life,

934
00:51:57,840 --> 00:52:01,800
but it's still not, it's
still simple choices. Like
we, I don't think we can, uh,

935
00:52:02,220 --> 00:52:05,370
have you go to sleep by the public and
make up a democrat or vice versa yet.

936
00:52:07,450 --> 00:52:11,900
All right. Thanks for
that talk. It was my loan.

937
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:16,280
So I work in advertising and uh,
you know,

938
00:52:16,281 --> 00:52:18,980
it's interesting that you brought
up like some fruit because you know,

939
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:22,790
advertising and public relations
and Sigma for psychology,

940
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:27,140
I have done this was for the past century
and all the examples that you gave

941
00:52:27,141 --> 00:52:30,770
were really are inspiring and they
were coming from individuals wanting to

942
00:52:30,771 --> 00:52:34,040
change their own behavior.
Um,

943
00:52:34,340 --> 00:52:38,420
but if they feel that I'm in right
now is really interested in cognitive

944
00:52:38,421 --> 00:52:41,060
behavioral theory,
choice architecture,

945
00:52:41,120 --> 00:52:44,270
whereas not necessarily I
want to be a better person.

946
00:52:44,330 --> 00:52:48,860
It's like I have a product and
I want you to buy it and a,

947
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:53,960
and this terrifies me because it just
seems like one more tool in the toolbox.

948
00:52:54,860 --> 00:52:57,830
And as exciting as the says,
I just have,

949
00:52:57,831 --> 00:53:01,640
this is still the ambition where you
have the, you know, the rich students,

950
00:53:01,641 --> 00:53:06,641
silicon valley that has super powers and
then 97% of people on earth that having

951
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:12,670
choices, me for them, like the person
that thinks we're choosing the biotin. Um,

952
00:53:13,690 --> 00:53:18,540
okay. How do you see it for Beth?

953
00:53:18,630 --> 00:53:22,570
This can be used to make people
stop smoking or eat healthy.

954
00:53:22,571 --> 00:53:27,300
But it can also make you wake up in one
corner corner better than Pepsi and it

955
00:53:27,420 --> 00:53:31,770
works the same way to bring, doesn't
know what thought that you, so it's,

956
00:53:31,790 --> 00:53:32,960
it's absolutely the screen.

957
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:38,190
I mean if I were to
choose my dream audience,

958
00:53:38,191 --> 00:53:41,880
this would be this tool because you are
in many ways are the ones who are able

959
00:53:41,890 --> 00:53:43,350
to navigate the toy.

960
00:53:43,351 --> 00:53:47,160
So it would take forever
until what we found right now,

961
00:53:47,161 --> 00:53:50,130
how we did it will turn into a regulation
by the government and something that's

962
00:53:50,131 --> 00:53:50,281
so,

963
00:53:50,281 --> 00:53:54,150
so that it's going to be self regulation
for now a company is we have to decide

964
00:53:54,300 --> 00:53:55,010
how to use that.

965
00:53:55,010 --> 00:53:58,260
And in the same way we understand
that we can make people eat healthy.

966
00:53:58,261 --> 00:54:01,200
We can also make them do things
that are not great for them.

967
00:54:01,830 --> 00:54:04,170
And what I would say if I talked
to my son and I would say,

968
00:54:04,380 --> 00:54:08,460
I hope I could speak to people that
FDA have the power to use it right now.

969
00:54:11,430 --> 00:54:15,300
I mean it stoically no, my, I teach
Mba students and when I teach them,

970
00:54:15,301 --> 00:54:20,160
there is still young and eh,
kind of, I don't know, pure.

971
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:25,640
And we talk about the cognitive biases
and we talk about behavioral changes and

972
00:54:27,150 --> 00:54:29,320
they all are up in optimistic about too,

973
00:54:29,370 --> 00:54:32,940
how Procter and gamble prices tied
the six 99 when it's actually seven.

974
00:54:32,941 --> 00:54:36,150
But it's fooling your sensors and then
they go and work for proctor and gamble

975
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:39,750
and the gloves, same choices. So,
eh, because it's like, you know,

976
00:54:39,751 --> 00:54:42,160
shareholders and pressure
and so on. I think that, Eh,

977
00:54:43,160 --> 00:54:48,160
science is only so good in
offering options and then
the world has to decide to

978
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:50,250
do with them.

979
00:54:50,250 --> 00:54:53,620
Do you have any tips for someone like me
when somebody comes and says like this,

980
00:54:53,621 --> 00:54:55,470
this thing's going to be amazing.
It's going to drive.

981
00:54:55,471 --> 00:55:00,471
So many conversions is going to be so
effective other than it just feels wrong.

982
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:05,670
Um, I would think a better one than
ever right now because I think it's the,

983
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:07,980
but I mean you think young,

984
00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:11,550
but I think in 20 years are going to be
to feel this company has thought, Eh,

985
00:55:12,210 --> 00:55:15,630
[inaudible] agree that when you're going
to see all you remember at this moment,

986
00:55:16,170 --> 00:55:19,890
and Eh,
I think I'm up in the meeting,

987
00:55:19,891 --> 00:55:21,300
I think that the world is
actually getting better.

988
00:55:21,301 --> 00:55:23,460
So the fact that you asked this
question means that it's like,

989
00:55:23,490 --> 00:55:26,430
by the way you've seen it, you see
the problem, you see the potential.

990
00:55:26,750 --> 00:55:30,450
Is there opportunity institute threat,
then I think that's a great first step.

991
00:55:30,780 --> 00:55:34,650
And the reality is that every time I
gave this talk with different version,

992
00:55:34,830 --> 00:55:36,690
people raise these questions,

993
00:55:36,691 --> 00:55:41,400
which means that we all see that and
we're both customers and companies.

994
00:55:41,460 --> 00:55:46,140
So if you do it to one person in the
evening, they're going to do they after.

995
00:55:46,141 --> 00:55:49,050
So I think that I,
historically,

996
00:55:49,051 --> 00:55:52,170
humans are not great in
using science for good.

997
00:55:52,590 --> 00:55:55,650
We usually find ways to explain it,
but I'm optimistic still.

998
00:55:56,010 --> 00:56:00,510
So I taught the questions. Great. Hello.

999
00:56:00,610 --> 00:56:04,240
Thanks Sol. A sex allows for the
insertion talks. I'm just wondering,

1000
00:56:04,241 --> 00:56:07,420
so would you consider your,
uh,

1001
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:11,800
your experiment as a counter
example? Two of three. We'll,

1002
00:56:11,950 --> 00:56:14,080
do you have any response
from philosophers? Yeah.

1003
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:15,753
Okay.
So

1004
00:56:17,430 --> 00:56:21,830
I get asked a lot about free
will and the reality is that, eh,

1005
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:23,980
we don't have a good
answer in the sense that,

1006
00:56:23,981 --> 00:56:27,300
so we get you beyond the moment
you've experienced this for you.

1007
00:56:27,320 --> 00:56:30,200
So if I ask you when you made
a choice to go left or right,

1008
00:56:30,201 --> 00:56:32,770
you would say no and what we
showed you that this was a mistake,

1009
00:56:32,771 --> 00:56:35,640
surely the moment you made the choice
is not the moment that brand managers,

1010
00:56:35,650 --> 00:56:37,540
we can go back milliseconds,

1011
00:56:37,660 --> 00:56:41,380
seconds before the choice was made
and predicted with high accuracy.

1012
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:45,130
But it doesn't mean that there's no free
will. It just maybe happened before.

1013
00:56:45,131 --> 00:56:49,260
Maybe flow will happen at time zero
and just you experience it as fair.

1014
00:56:49,261 --> 00:56:51,640
We'll have time for,
so we don't have the answer to.

1015
00:56:51,641 --> 00:56:52,480
It's like the Big Bang theory.

1016
00:56:52,481 --> 00:56:55,960
We thought we can go all the way to the
very beginning but we can't go beyond,

1017
00:56:56,500 --> 00:56:56,920
Eh,

1018
00:56:56,920 --> 00:57:01,240
I can tell you that we ask questions of
our subjects in this experiment and we

1019
00:57:01,241 --> 00:57:02,710
can say that their psychology,

1020
00:57:02,740 --> 00:57:05,500
like the patients when they experience
that there are choices to be belittled.

1021
00:57:05,650 --> 00:57:08,920
They do have all kinds of
questioning about like more life.

1022
00:57:08,930 --> 00:57:12,650
Like they become a little
bit more protective of
brides. The defend criminals,

1023
00:57:12,670 --> 00:57:16,780
a little bit different than the, it kind
of brings big questions about life. Eh?

1024
00:57:16,781 --> 00:57:21,781
The counter answer is example that I read
a few weeks ago there was a gene that

1025
00:57:24,690 --> 00:57:25,300
Eh,

1026
00:57:25,300 --> 00:57:29,890
if you carry this gene I think you are
nine times more likely to be involved in

1027
00:57:29,891 --> 00:57:30,581
a crime.

1028
00:57:30,581 --> 00:57:35,060
Generally I think none of the people in
this role chairing this gene and there's

1029
00:57:35,080 --> 00:57:37,150
others care about this
and if the y chromosome,

1030
00:57:37,870 --> 00:57:42,870
so most bad things are caused by men
so we can predict when you're born and

1031
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:45,740
you're going to be on the side
of potentially bad big square.

1032
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:47,410
It doesn't allow us to
do anything about it.

1033
00:57:47,411 --> 00:57:48,670
We have to wait three to do those things.

1034
00:57:48,910 --> 00:57:51,940
So when we came to judges with
our results and said like, look,

1035
00:57:51,941 --> 00:57:55,660
we can actually help you decode the
intentions of people. And they said, look,

1036
00:57:55,661 --> 00:57:56,051
you guys,

1037
00:57:56,051 --> 00:58:00,580
scientist came to us in the 1920s with
eh phonology and he told us that you can

1038
00:58:00,790 --> 00:58:03,940
touch the scallop and fee out when
someone is going to something bad.

1039
00:58:03,941 --> 00:58:07,120
And then you came up to us 10 years after
and he said, no, no, this was a mistake.

1040
00:58:07,150 --> 00:58:08,590
EEG is the right way to go.

1041
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:11,430
And then you can toss in the 70s with
Fmr and now you're coming to us with your

1042
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:12,040
tools.

1043
00:58:12,040 --> 00:58:15,570
We're going to wait a few decades before
we going to let you actually predict

1044
00:58:15,590 --> 00:58:17,500
behavior because you've turned your mind.
I think their rights.

1045
00:58:17,501 --> 00:58:19,810
I think that we can predict some extent,

1046
00:58:19,811 --> 00:58:23,230
but we're still making mistakes and
that's enough to not be a useful tool to

1047
00:58:23,350 --> 00:58:27,120
really drive a cow. And just
your thoughts. Thank you so much.

1048
00:58:27,970 --> 00:58:28,803
Last one.

1049
00:58:29,330 --> 00:58:33,860
Yeah. So I'm actually a couple of
other questions. The first one is a,

1050
00:58:33,900 --> 00:58:38,750
in terms of I need to find people's
thoughts and intentions, uh,

1051
00:58:38,970 --> 00:58:41,900
that the state of the suicide is actually,

1052
00:58:41,901 --> 00:58:46,901
is it mostly about trying to identify
what areas of the brain get activated when

1053
00:58:47,451 --> 00:58:50,110
people think somethings
are, have some ideas? Uh,

1054
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:53,810
odd on the other side was
looking at something like, oh,

1055
00:58:53,811 --> 00:58:56,470
you have usually a few dollars, the 50
that you send to your speech centers,

1056
00:58:56,471 --> 00:58:59,960
audio muscles or whatever. Uh, his other
two main things that are there are,

1057
00:58:59,961 --> 00:59:04,290
they are, they are as something
much more advanced than there too.

1058
00:59:04,870 --> 00:59:08,820
So the mirror frames of our work
has kind of two angles, one ticket,

1059
00:59:08,830 --> 00:59:12,910
the one very theoretical. So the
application is, we're trying to be really,

1060
00:59:12,911 --> 00:59:16,060
really good in decoding thoughts so
we can teach you how to control things

1061
00:59:16,061 --> 00:59:17,200
outside and general behavior.

1062
00:59:17,410 --> 00:59:20,140
So we want to help people
get smoke to stop smoking.

1063
00:59:20,320 --> 00:59:22,520
We went to the people who
cannot move their arms,

1064
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:26,000
control a robotic arm or wheelchair and
move around. This is the application.

1065
00:59:26,150 --> 00:59:28,970
And then we just try to improve the,
the accuracy.

1066
00:59:29,210 --> 00:59:32,840
If right now I can predict your choice
now 10 times, I want to get to 10 of them.

1067
00:59:33,260 --> 00:59:35,870
That's that.
The other angle is neuroscience.

1068
00:59:36,290 --> 00:59:40,040
The fact that we found how the brain comes
a taught in those electrical chemical

1069
00:59:40,190 --> 00:59:43,900
is spikes is still crude.
Eh?

1070
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:45,230
Sometimes you heard that it goes from

1071
00:59:47,270 --> 00:59:51,680
but we don't know exactly like why
is it that speed and that speed and

1072
00:59:51,950 --> 00:59:56,330
presumably this Carrie is the most
interesting part of our life. Like those,

1073
00:59:56,390 --> 00:59:59,600
it's not, the brain doesn't trend over
the spike. Every spike mean something.

1074
00:59:59,720 --> 01:00:03,740
So we now try to not just be binary and
say Melman law, but we have in the law.

1075
01:00:03,741 --> 01:00:07,010
But actually why is it coding
amendment or this way? Not that way.

1076
01:00:07,190 --> 01:00:08,210
What about associations?

1077
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:13,440
If my [inaudible] reminds you of a
JFK will the cell that code minimum or

1078
01:00:13,950 --> 01:00:16,660
Firefall Kennedy as well.
If we fight for Canada,

1079
01:00:16,661 --> 01:00:19,760
we would fight for Bobby Kennedy and
other Kennedy's or just for one that you

1080
01:00:19,761 --> 01:00:22,520
can. How far is it? So those are
interesting questions. Philosophically,

1081
01:00:22,700 --> 01:00:26,300
when in your life did you acquire this,
why didn't you pick this cell, that cell?

1082
01:00:26,380 --> 01:00:30,920
So the neuroscience is really both
interesting and in need of people with

1083
01:00:30,980 --> 01:00:31,813
technical skills.

1084
01:00:31,930 --> 01:00:34,280
Sure. Oh Man. The second question was, um,

1085
01:00:36,590 --> 01:00:39,650
how transferable is this
from one person to the other?

1086
01:00:39,651 --> 01:00:42,320
But I'm assuming that the
way one person has an idea,

1087
01:00:42,990 --> 01:00:45,270
their knowledge base about myrtle
is entirely different from,

1088
01:00:45,910 --> 01:00:49,220
and there was some things about the
idea of not a mentor. And uh, so, uh,

1089
01:00:49,221 --> 01:00:53,120
do you see this being applied from a,
you like, say something's 10 years,

1090
01:00:53,300 --> 01:00:57,200
20 years down the line and
maybe 10 people maybe like, um,

1091
01:00:57,201 --> 01:01:00,680
a thousand people see my billboard in
Times Square and then somebody captures

1092
01:01:00,681 --> 01:01:04,660
that data to figure out, just say what
facing industry in terms of thoughts, uh,

1093
01:01:04,790 --> 01:01:05,120
are,

1094
01:01:05,120 --> 01:01:08,540
do you think this is not transferable at
all based on the deal that you've seen?

1095
01:01:09,030 --> 01:01:09,870
So high level,

1096
01:01:10,610 --> 01:01:13,750
it's not so highly about meaning in all
of our brains that part of their brain

1097
01:01:13,751 --> 01:01:16,000
that codes people is the same.

1098
01:01:16,060 --> 01:01:20,330
So there's a part of it comes to life
when you think about it or we're not going

1099
01:01:20,340 --> 01:01:21,850
to go on a log,
but within your spot there are many,

1100
01:01:21,851 --> 01:01:25,510
many millions or billions of neurons
and they're, they're chaotic.

1101
01:01:25,540 --> 01:01:27,790
Like y'all made him a little
failures here and mine is there.

1102
01:01:27,850 --> 01:01:29,560
They're all in the same stadium,

1103
01:01:29,561 --> 01:01:33,970
but you might sit in section one and
section two and we didn't find any way to

1104
01:01:33,971 --> 01:01:38,680
kind of map one brain to another
in that highest resolution in,

1105
01:01:38,770 --> 01:01:42,400
but there's a noble prize hanging on a,
on, on the understanding of, you know,

1106
01:01:42,580 --> 01:01:45,340
how the brain actually decide
which sell to code this.

1107
01:01:45,341 --> 01:01:48,730
There's all kinds of questions like how
do I structure the fragment member weeds

1108
01:01:48,731 --> 01:01:50,860
and moving them over night? And there's
a lot of people with what it is,

1109
01:01:50,861 --> 01:01:54,430
but no one actually knows when the brain
chose to put it here and not there.

1110
01:01:54,431 --> 01:01:56,530
And why. Now, the reason it's really,

1111
01:01:56,531 --> 01:02:00,320
really interesting is that I can map your
brain and find the minimum on the oil

1112
01:02:00,321 --> 01:02:02,920
and the Eiffel Tower and your
mum and dead cells in your brain.

1113
01:02:03,040 --> 01:02:04,260
And I can find anything he sprain.

1114
01:02:04,750 --> 01:02:07,480
And once we do that we can
actually override communication.

1115
01:02:07,481 --> 01:02:09,700
So if you think about
historically we're still,

1116
01:02:09,970 --> 01:02:12,970
we know we evolved in a lot
of ways in the last decades,

1117
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,450
but communication is still the same way.
If you find any other time,

1118
01:02:15,460 --> 01:02:20,190
like now he and you would speak the
same, we'd vocal chords, eh mouth.

1119
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:22,530
And we know that it's
a pretty slow process.

1120
01:02:22,950 --> 01:02:27,950
I can think thoughts in about a 600
thoughts per second per minute soil,

1121
01:02:29,550 --> 01:02:34,170
how much I can bring it in. But I can
talk them only at 150 words per minute.

1122
01:02:34,200 --> 01:02:38,440
I can do 300 but you can
do so. So we, we are,

1123
01:02:38,441 --> 01:02:42,300
we're very slow like we think a lot faster
than our bandwidth is to communicate

1124
01:02:42,301 --> 01:02:44,310
them.
And we also received the minutes festival.

1125
01:02:44,311 --> 01:02:47,670
Clearly there was a card barrier
here that if we overcome,

1126
01:02:47,671 --> 01:02:51,390
if I can just find the middle and also in
your brain and my brain and I think it,

1127
01:02:51,391 --> 01:02:53,520
I just Zap your brain and
you immediately see it,
