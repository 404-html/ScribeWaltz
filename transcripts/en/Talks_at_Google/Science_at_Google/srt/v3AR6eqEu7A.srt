1
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,570
Well. Hello Google. Thank
you so much for having me.

2
00:00:15,571 --> 00:00:17,310
It's brilliant to see you all here.

3
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:21,780
I'm only slightly disappointed
that there's no dogs in
the audience because that

4
00:00:21,781 --> 00:00:23,100
would have been completely awesome,

5
00:00:23,101 --> 00:00:25,760
but maybe next time we have a burger
you can all bring your dogs in.

6
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:29,010
That would be amazing. Um, so yeah,
I'm here to talk about my book,

7
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:31,470
bring back the king,
the new science of de Extinction,

8
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,500
which is all about as kit said,

9
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:38,580
the ability of scientists to bring
extinct animals back to life.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,420
And it's a science and that's
very much in development.

11
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:47,210
It's not quite with us now, but I think
it will be with us reasonably. See,

12
00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:48,421
uh,
and this is,

13
00:00:48,421 --> 00:00:52,950
you can see is the book
here is my dog Higgs.

14
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:57,330
He's modeling the book, therefore you,
just to give you an idea of sample copies,

15
00:00:57,331 --> 00:01:00,000
he's called, he's called
Higgs, the dog particle,

16
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,540
which is a joke that
you guys at Google gap,

17
00:01:03,541 --> 00:01:06,670
which I can leave you love cause people
would normally look at me and stare

18
00:01:06,671 --> 00:01:11,670
blankly at that point. So that is
Higgs before he read the book. And

19
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,420
that is Higgs. Afterwards, I think
he found it quite satisfying,

20
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:23,760
quite exhausting. Uh, so he's
my promo dog, which is good. So,

21
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:27,570
um, the book asks, which animal
would you like to bring back?

22
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,690
And I'm doing an event at
new scientists this weekend,

23
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:35,010
and we put out a thing on Twitter just
to gauge people's reaction to this.

24
00:01:35,011 --> 00:01:38,520
We said, what animals from the
past would you like to resurrect?

25
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:41,640
Just to get a feeling of where
people were with this topic?

26
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,810
And sample answers included the great org.

27
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:50,520
Good example, a smiler dawn,
which is a saber tooth cat.

28
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:56,100
Interesting. And somebody said, I'd
like a pet velociraptor, please.

29
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:00,060
Which kind of intrigued me.
So I tweeted them back and I said,

30
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:03,390
why a pet velociraptor?
And the guy said,

31
00:02:03,391 --> 00:02:06,030
because I fancy a pet
with retractable claws,

32
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:12,240
which is kind of interesting. So I tweeted
him back and I said, how about a cat?

33
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:16,170
And he tweeted me back and said,
I'm not a cat person.

34
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:22,740
So there we are. And you'll notice
also, I've, uh, anonymized these tweets.

35
00:02:22,741 --> 00:02:26,940
Clearly I'm not just followed by people
that have Guinea pig avatars. I've just,

36
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,580
so there we are, um, uh,

37
00:02:29,581 --> 00:02:34,581
other sample answers just quickly before
I moved on include can they make a half

38
00:02:34,651 --> 00:02:36,420
man half woolly mammoth,

39
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:40,470
which is interesting cause I think I've
been living with that particular thing

40
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:42,540
for about the last 10 years.

41
00:02:42,541 --> 00:02:46,550
He's called a man off to
see what I've done that um,

42
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:50,790
somebody else said, Margaret
Thatcher clones, thousands of them,

43
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,740
millions,
an army

44
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:58,170
slightly disconcerting.
That's not what the extinction is about.

45
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,590
And then somebody hit the nail on
the head almost when they said Dojo.

46
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:07,600
Then I farmed them and
start a fast food chain.

47
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:13,030
Dodos Kf d Dodo cottage,
which was a good joke,

48
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:15,430
but was topped when somebody else tweeted

49
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:21,760
Nando days. Genius. Absolute genius. Okay.

50
00:03:21,761 --> 00:03:23,230
So let me tell you about the extinction.

51
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:28,210
I want to start by telling you a
story and it's a story about a goat,

52
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:32,950
but this wasn't any usual kind of goat.
Uh,

53
00:03:32,951 --> 00:03:37,951
this was a goat that lived in the Pyrenees
thousands of years ago and these were

54
00:03:38,201 --> 00:03:41,650
amazing animals. They
were big, stocky beasts.

55
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:46,210
They weighed about as much as a washing
machine, but they were much more agile.

56
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:50,350
And have these enormous,
great big curved horns.

57
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:54,430
And what they used to do is they used
to spring around on the mountain sides

58
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:59,590
casting impressive horn silhouettes
against the clear blue sky cloudless sky.

59
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:05,320
And they did that brilliantly familiar
with thousands of years until we came

60
00:04:05,321 --> 00:04:07,660
along at the end of the 19th century.

61
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:13,300
And we looked at them and we looked at
their horns and we looked at our empty

62
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:18,250
living room walls, and you'll have to
remember this within a time before Ikea.

63
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:22,810
So there was no to go to buy
reasonably priced pictures or frames.

64
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:25,210
So our walls were empty
at that point in time.

65
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:27,610
So they looked at it be Kardos horns.

66
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:30,470
They looked at that empty living
room walls and they thought,

67
00:04:30,471 --> 00:04:34,090
do you know what that would
look really good there,

68
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:35,673
which is a shame.

69
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:40,000
So we started hunting them
and their numbers plummeted.

70
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:45,280
So then if you fast forward to the year,
1999 there was only one left,

71
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:50,500
one bucardo and that was an
elderly adult female called Celia.

72
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:53,920
And scientists knew that
her time was running out.

73
00:04:53,921 --> 00:04:55,630
They knew they had to do something.

74
00:04:56,410 --> 00:05:00,700
So they went up on the mountain side and
they caught Celia and they put a radio

75
00:05:00,701 --> 00:05:05,230
tracking collar around her neck and then
they let her go and they kept an eye on

76
00:05:05,231 --> 00:05:08,830
her to see what she was up to.
And then the next year,

77
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:13,930
the radio tracking collar let
out an ominous beep, beep beep.

78
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:17,020
And it was the signal
they had been dreading.

79
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,750
They rushed up the mountain to find her,

80
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:23,920
only to discover that Celia had
been crushed by a falling tree.

81
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:27,610
Can have an office, Celia, thank you.

82
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:32,680
So they'd be Cardo was no more,
it had three east to be,

83
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:38,620
it was an extinct Bucardo and that was it.
And that should be it.

84
00:05:38,621 --> 00:05:42,790
That's, that's what happens when animals
go extinct. That should be the end of it,

85
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:48,310
except that increasingly that
doesn't have to be the case anymore.

86
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:52,840
So actually if you rewind a bit to the
point when they put the tracking collar

87
00:05:52,841 --> 00:05:55,810
around her neck, they did
something else. The scientists,

88
00:05:56,140 --> 00:06:00,050
they actually took a couple of biopsy
samples from the animal and they carted

89
00:06:00,051 --> 00:06:02,930
them away and they froze down
herselves in liquid nitrogen.

90
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:05,570
And then a couple of years after she died,

91
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:11,080
they thought these cells and they did
the kind of experiment with them that a

92
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:14,660
few years earlier had been
used to make Dolly the sheep.

93
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:18,530
Now are you guys familiar with Dolly
the sheep? I'm guessing you are.

94
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:22,640
So here she is. I just want to side
track and talk about Dolly for a second.

95
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:27,880
So Dolly the sheep was of course the
thirst mammal to be cloned from an adult's

96
00:06:27,911 --> 00:06:31,820
out and she showed that you
can take the DNA from an adult,

97
00:06:31,821 --> 00:06:36,821
so add it into an egg that's had its own
DNA removed and then use that to create

98
00:06:37,911 --> 00:06:40,610
life.
And that was the nominal.

99
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:45,560
So jolly became this huge media sensation.

100
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:49,730
The pepper APTC literally
followed her every move.

101
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:53,570
So here she is on the front
cover of Nature magazine.

102
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:57,800
Shortly after she was born,
then he or she is a few years later

103
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:04,880
on the front cover of Hello magazine.
Uh, and then a few years after that,

104
00:07:04,881 --> 00:07:05,714
sadly

105
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:12,350
on the cover of Waitrose food illustrated
with a little rosemary and garlic,

106
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:18,593
no

107
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:26,990
where she's ended up, she stuffed
and she is in a museum in Scotland.

108
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:31,070
That's our final resting place.
God rest her little fleecy soul.

109
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:36,350
So that was the experiment that
inspired the Bucardo scientists. Okay.

110
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:41,770
So they did the same kind of experiment
and then in 2003 after hundreds and

111
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:45,800
hundreds of attempts,
something incredible happened.

112
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:48,260
And this is the actual
moment when it happened.

113
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:54,610
So they created a little baby be
Comado Celia's identical clone.

114
00:07:55,940 --> 00:08:00,800
So this is the moment that de
extinction actually first happened.

115
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:04,400
And this was actually over 10 years ago,
which most people don't realize.

116
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:07,670
So it was a phenomenal achievement.
Phenomenal.

117
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:13,400
And she was beautiful. This little
clone, she was gorgeous. She had towels,

118
00:08:13,401 --> 00:08:17,510
all the brown stair and wonky
legs and toffee colored eyes.

119
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:21,290
But unfortunately she
developed breathing problems.

120
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:24,950
And then she died just a couple
of minutes after she was born.

121
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:30,970
So they'd be Cardo isn't just the
first animal to become extinct.

122
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:35,270
It's also the first animal
ever to go extinct twice,

123
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:37,580
which is a bit of a shame.

124
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:42,290
But I spoke to the scientists who were
involved in this particular piece of work

125
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:47,180
and they absolutely assure me
that with time and with funding,

126
00:08:47,181 --> 00:08:48,860
those are the two limiting factors.

127
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:52,970
They are completely convinced they
will be able to bring the Bucardo back,

128
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:54,470
not just one,

129
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:58,770
but many healthy be Kardos that they'd
like to see released into their former

130
00:08:58,771 --> 00:09:02,340
range.
So I don't know how that makes you feel,

131
00:09:02,341 --> 00:09:04,110
but that story leaves
me with mixed emotions.

132
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:07,680
I feel pretty sad that we
treated that Bicharto so badly,

133
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:11,430
but I feel really excited
for what might be possible.

134
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,940
And I want to show you my
favorite photograph of me ever.

135
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:18,990
So this is me on the beach at
charm earth as Kipp mentioned,

136
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:22,830
and I'm a little dude on the right hand
side in the Austin Red Wellie boots.

137
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:26,520
And I'm about two years old
and we used to go down there,

138
00:09:26,521 --> 00:09:28,320
fossil hunting and the Rock,

139
00:09:28,321 --> 00:09:32,010
there are 198 million years old.

140
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:35,760
They were formed at a
time when there were huge,

141
00:09:35,761 --> 00:09:38,370
great big reptilian sea
monsters in the sea,

142
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:42,000
pterosaurs in the sky and
dinosaurs on the land.

143
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:45,390
And it made me dream about
bringing back a dinosaur.

144
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:49,650
So when you think about the extinction,
you think about what might be possible.

145
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:53,280
And I began to wonder,
could you bring back a dinosaur?

146
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,370
And if you did bring back a dinosaur,
to my mind,

147
00:09:56,400 --> 00:10:00,450
there's only one contender
and it's this t rex.

148
00:10:00,451 --> 00:10:01,770
It has to be a t rex,

149
00:10:01,771 --> 00:10:06,150
right once described as the
absolute warlord of the jungle.

150
00:10:07,530 --> 00:10:09,960
It's teeth have in the
scientific literature,

151
00:10:09,961 --> 00:10:13,710
quite humorously been
described as lethal bananas.

152
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:16,890
So if ever,
there's two words that don't go together.

153
00:10:16,891 --> 00:10:21,780
I think it's lethal and banana or
possibly Trump and white house,

154
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:27,930
also quite bad. So I was really
interested, can you bring a dinosaur back?

155
00:10:27,931 --> 00:10:32,430
So I spoke to the scientists and they
tell me, it boils down to one rule,

156
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:36,150
magic ingredient,
which is this DNA.

157
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:38,040
And here is some that I knitted earlier.

158
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:44,100
So DNA is a very beautiful molecule,
but it's very flimsy. It's very fragile.

159
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:46,290
And after we die,
it begins to breakdown.

160
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:50,760
And in exceptional circumstances it
can be preserved for a long time.

161
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:56,270
But the oldest thing we
have ever extracted DNA from
meaningful amounts of DNA

162
00:10:56,461 --> 00:10:58,740
from is less than a million years old.

163
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:03,690
So dinosaurs died out 65
million years ago. So no DNA,

164
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:07,620
no dinosaurs, sorry. So we're
not going to see a dinosaur.

165
00:11:07,621 --> 00:11:12,150
The closest thing we will ever get to
a living, breathing dinosaur is this,

166
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:17,550
which is my dog in a dinosaur onesie.

167
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:21,960
Shortly before he called the Irs Pca.
So now it's dinosaurs.

168
00:11:21,961 --> 00:11:26,280
The other question I get from people
is, how about these, how about Joe dies?

169
00:11:26,281 --> 00:11:28,440
And I have to see these
beautiful illustrations,

170
00:11:28,441 --> 00:11:32,910
which are in the book or the work of a
guy called Matt Dawson who is fantastic.

171
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:35,920
And so this is his Dodo.
Could you bring a Dodo back?

172
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:40,320
Now they died much more recently. So in
theory it might be a bit more possible.

173
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:41,221
However,

174
00:11:41,221 --> 00:11:46,221
where they lived in malicious was very
hot and the soil where they fell when

175
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:51,570
they died was very acidic. So that
DNA is not preserved. So no DNA,

176
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:54,010
no dodos.
Sorry about that,

177
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:57,970
but he got this idea going in my head
when I was thinking about the book and I

178
00:11:57,971 --> 00:12:01,210
thought, so he can't do
dinosaurs. You can't do dodos.

179
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,880
You need something from
much more recent history.

180
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:08,230
How far could you take this technology?
Where could you go with it?

181
00:12:08,231 --> 00:12:11,290
And I began wondering about this man,

182
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:13,510
Elvis Presley.

183
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:19,140
Amanda deemed so sexy by the TV stations
of the fifties that they refuse to show

184
00:12:19,871 --> 00:12:23,860
him from the waist down.
He was too damn sexy.

185
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:27,790
And I began to wonder, could you,
I don't think it's a good idea.

186
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:29,680
I am not saying that we should do this,

187
00:12:29,681 --> 00:12:33,940
but as a thought experiment
with the technology we have,
could this be possible?

188
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:38,620
And then I came across this website,
genuine,

189
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:42,550
genuine website,
Americans for cloning.

190
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:47,020
Elvis founded by a guy called Bob Mayer,
who I spoke to you for the book,

191
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:52,350
alarmingly banned on Facebook and they
have a petition you can sign if you think

192
00:12:53,951 --> 00:12:56,530
cloning is a good plenty.
Elvis is a good idea.

193
00:12:57,340 --> 00:13:01,480
And quite a lot of people have signed
it. How serious they are. I don't know.

194
00:13:01,481 --> 00:13:02,140
Anyway,

195
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:06,580
the good thing about this website is it
gives you a couple of ideas of starting

196
00:13:06,581 --> 00:13:10,330
places for Elvis is DNA.
Cause if you want to bring back Elvis,

197
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:11,800
you need a source of his DNA.

198
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:16,000
So the first possible source
of Dna they recommend is this.

199
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:19,330
These are toenails.

200
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:25,020
So there's a lady called Joanie Mae and
she runs a museum in America and she was

201
00:13:26,141 --> 00:13:30,850
going through gracelands shortly after
Elvis Presley died and she went through

202
00:13:30,851 --> 00:13:35,851
his man cave room is man Dan and had a
carpet like this but dark green shag pile

203
00:13:36,161 --> 00:13:36,994
carpet.

204
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:41,620
And she kind of got down to her knees
at one point and started just feeling

205
00:13:41,621 --> 00:13:42,371
around the carpet,

206
00:13:42,371 --> 00:13:47,371
maybe a bit odd but hey and I think a
snagged on something and she picked it up

207
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:50,650
thinking it was like a way would seek
Quinn or something and it was dark.

208
00:13:50,651 --> 00:13:54,070
So she popped it in her pocket and when
she got outside she discovered it was a

209
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:58,330
toenail.
Now toenails are good sources of DNA.

210
00:13:58,331 --> 00:14:02,110
They preserve it really, really well.
But you guys are probably ahead of me.

211
00:14:02,111 --> 00:14:06,580
This isn't an obvious choice for bringing
back Elvis because what if it didn't

212
00:14:06,581 --> 00:14:07,450
belong to Elvis?

213
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:11,380
What if it belonged to some American
Doris wearing open toed sandals?

214
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:14,500
It's an awful lot of trouble to go to.
So we scratched that off the list,

215
00:14:14,501 --> 00:14:16,090
but they have another source of DNA.

216
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:20,770
And this is Joanie maybes prize
possession in her Elvis Museum.

217
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:26,140
It's the Elvis wart.
So in that little test tube,

218
00:14:26,141 --> 00:14:30,160
there is a test tube of
formaldehyde and it has a wart.

219
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:33,850
Now Elvis Presley used to have a water
on the back of his hand and before he

220
00:14:33,851 --> 00:14:36,190
went into the military service,
the water was removed.

221
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:41,700
And his doctor had the foresight to say
that this is in the days before a bay.

222
00:14:42,401 --> 00:14:43,930
So it was quite forward thinking.

223
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:47,440
And then it was purchased by the lady
from the museum. And I thought, well,

224
00:14:47,441 --> 00:14:52,441
maybe we could get DNA from this
and we could get DNA from this,

225
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:55,460
but warts are caused by viruses.

226
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:59,120
So this DNA is going to be a
mix of human and viral DNA.

227
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:03,230
So we don't want to go that either.
So I kind of ground to a halt.

228
00:15:03,231 --> 00:15:06,290
And then I thought, well hang
on a minute. How about this?

229
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:12,080
How about Elvis Presley's
famous iconic quiff, right? Hey,

230
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:16,490
it's a really, really good source of
DNA. What would happen if we did that?

231
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:22,300
And I went onto ebay out of curiosity
and I put in the phrase celebrity hair

232
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,280
cause I was intrigued to
see what would come up.

233
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,590
And it's really
interesting if you do that.

234
00:15:27,591 --> 00:15:29,420
If you put in the phrase celebrity hair,

235
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:33,140
you can buy locks of hair that
belonged to all sorts of people,

236
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:38,120
including Abraham Lincoln,
Princess Diana and Michael Jackson,

237
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:42,500
presumably from before the
Pepsi Commercial. Don't
know if you remember that.

238
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:45,350
You can buy hair from Elvis Presley.

239
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:48,380
And I'd just like to read
you if you'll humor me,

240
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:53,210
a small excerpt from my
book of what happened when I
actually bought a sample of

241
00:15:53,211 --> 00:15:54,830
Elvis Presley's hair on Ebay.

242
00:15:56,930 --> 00:16:00,950
So this is chapter six, the king of
rock and roll. It goes like this.

243
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:03,710
When it finally arrived,

244
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:08,630
I was more than a little disappointed
sometime earlier I had bought some of

245
00:16:08,631 --> 00:16:13,631
Elvis Presley's hair on Ebay and like a
child waiting for Christmas had then had

246
00:16:13,881 --> 00:16:17,230
to endure weeks of over
excitement and speculation.

247
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:19,220
While I waited for my purchase to turn up,

248
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:23,330
I was expecting something as
iconic as the king himself.

249
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:28,870
The package I told myself would at the
very least be made of gold army and

250
00:16:28,881 --> 00:16:30,380
studied in rhinestones.

251
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:35,720
It would arrive with great ceremony
serenaded on by its own backing band,

252
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:39,290
well done by the friends
he'd scream of female fans.

253
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:43,550
He would camp outside my house
and faint when the parcel arrived,

254
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:49,190
but when the postman finally delivered my
precious cargo, it was without fanfare.

255
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:53,060
He didn't even ring the bell.
He just popped the plain,

256
00:16:53,061 --> 00:16:55,910
that brown envelope through
the letterbox and walked away.

257
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:02,510
I picked up the drab and elvisy
anticlimax and turned it over in my hands.

258
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:07,250
Save for the Memphis postmark smudged
across the top right hand corner.

259
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:10,610
There was little hint as to the imports,
legendary contents,

260
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:13,550
perhaps things would be more
promising on the inside.

261
00:17:13,551 --> 00:17:18,440
I told myself brimming with
nervous energy, all shook up even.

262
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:20,090
Do you see what I've done?

263
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:24,080
I carefully open the envelope
and teased out the contents,

264
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:28,460
but the luxuriant quiff of my dreams
was nowhere to be seen. Instead,

265
00:17:28,461 --> 00:17:33,140
I found myself staring at an a four
sized certificate of authenticity.

266
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:37,970
You are now the proud owner of a
genuine strand of Elvis Presley's hair.

267
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:41,420
The certificate crowed,
but where was the hair?

268
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:46,220
Perhaps they had forgotten to include
it or maybe it was being sent. Sent,

269
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:49,380
sent separately and armed
guard from Graceland.

270
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:54,570
I scoured the shoddily photocopied piece
of paper for a claim and it was only

271
00:17:54,571 --> 00:17:58,200
then that I noticed a blob of dried
glue at the bottom of the page.

272
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:04,290
Inside it like an insect trapped in
amber was a short strand of hair.

273
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:08,730
I stared at it, unable to
believe what my eyes were seeing,

274
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:13,470
incapable of processing
what I held in my hands.

275
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:16,410
Words actually failed me.

276
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:22,250
Not only was the strand miniscule smaller
even than a single eyelash from my

277
00:18:22,921 --> 00:18:27,450
face, it was also, and I can't
bring myself to say this,

278
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:31,950
Ginger Elvis Presley.

279
00:18:31,951 --> 00:18:36,720
If the certificate was to be believed
with strawberry blonde as the penny

280
00:18:36,721 --> 00:18:39,000
dropped,
I felt so lonesome I could cry.

281
00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:44,690
I had spent $14 90 and enjoy the longer
wait than the kings fans had for his

282
00:18:44,971 --> 00:18:49,590
comeback tour only to receive what
appeared to be Ronald Mcdonald's nasal

283
00:18:49,591 --> 00:18:54,120
clippings.
So we did the only thing I could think of,

284
00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:57,930
I seals the certificate back
up in its original envelope,

285
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:01,710
found a thick black marker
pen and wrote upon it,

286
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:06,570
returned to sender,
adding that the address was unknown.

287
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:11,730
The irony I was sure would be lost on
them, but it put a smile back on my face.

288
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:16,080
Then bright and early the next
morning I sent my letter back.

289
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:20,100
Oh, one person. Thank you very much.

290
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:26,340
So listen, Elvis Presley, I was
so intrigued with this idea.

291
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:30,450
I phoned up a scientist, he works
in de extinction and I said to him,

292
00:19:30,810 --> 00:19:33,600
can you do extinct Elvis Presley?
Tell me.

293
00:19:34,050 --> 00:19:37,500
And he thought about it for a
while and then he said, yes,

294
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:41,430
people have been cloning
pop stars for decades.

295
00:19:43,170 --> 00:19:47,970
And I said, you know what? You're
right. Obviously, because Simon cow,

296
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:53,280
he produced one direction, didn't
he? And the scientists said yes.

297
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:57,690
And that is the reason that human
cloning must never be allowed.

298
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:04,160
So it must never be allowed for
all sorts of genuine ethical,

299
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:07,440
moral health and safety reasons.

300
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:11,700
And also because it leads
to the production of songs
like you don't know you're

301
00:20:11,701 --> 00:20:16,200
beautiful.
So with that I put the Elvis idea to bed.

302
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:20,910
Okay. De Extinction is not
about bringing back dinosaurs.

303
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:25,050
It is not about bringing back the king
of rock and roll. That was just my whim,

304
00:20:25,410 --> 00:20:29,550
my folly. And then I started
exploring de extinction more deeply.

305
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:31,680
And that's what I want
to talk to you about now.

306
00:20:31,681 --> 00:20:36,681
So there are genuinely about half a
dozen de extinction projects that are

307
00:20:37,051 --> 00:20:42,051
ongoing around the globe now trying to
bring back different endangered species

308
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:44,760
of animals.
This is one of them.

309
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:48,730
This is an animal called
gastric brooding frog.

310
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:53,170
And what you've got here is a big
frog with a little frog in its mouth.

311
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:58,840
Now the big frog isn't eating the little
frog, it's actually giving birth to it.

312
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:04,870
So this is a frog that was discovered
in 1973 in the babbling Brooks of

313
00:21:04,871 --> 00:21:07,960
Queensland, Australia. And what
would happen is the female,

314
00:21:07,961 --> 00:21:11,830
we'd like her acts and then the mail
would come along and fertilize them.

315
00:21:12,450 --> 00:21:16,180
Then the female would eat them,
she'd swallowed them,

316
00:21:16,181 --> 00:21:18,400
they pass into her stomach,
which we would,

317
00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:22,930
she would convert into a makeshift
womb and then the x would hatch,

318
00:21:23,410 --> 00:21:26,270
turn into tadpoles,
turned into frog legs.

319
00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:29,050
She could have about 20 in
her belly at any one time.

320
00:21:29,650 --> 00:21:34,030
And when the time was right, she would
literally button them up literally.

321
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:38,920
And this is the subject of a de
extinction project in Australia under the

322
00:21:38,921 --> 00:21:40,870
guidance of a guy called Mike Archer.

323
00:21:42,130 --> 00:21:45,100
And the guy who kept these animals in
his lab in the 70s before they went

324
00:21:45,101 --> 00:21:45,880
extinct,

325
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:50,380
had the foresight to save some body parts
in the freezer and they're using those

326
00:21:50,381 --> 00:21:52,780
for cloning.
So that's one project.

327
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:56,110
This is another project that you're
all probably a bit more familiar with.

328
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:59,170
There are the wonderful wooly,
mammoth,

329
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:02,590
the iconic species from the last ice age.

330
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,220
Now the woolly mammoth is a good
candidate for the extinction.

331
00:22:06,221 --> 00:22:09,310
Maybe because we have
plentiful sources of its DNA,

332
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:15,240
it's quite commonplace to find tusks
and teeth and bones in the melting

333
00:22:15,281 --> 00:22:16,630
permafrost of Siberia.

334
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:21,520
And sometimes sometimes scientists
come across stuff like this.

335
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,550
Okay,
so this might not look like much,

336
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:30,060
but this is actually pretty much the
entire torso of a woolly mammoth that was

337
00:22:30,281 --> 00:22:35,281
found in a remote Siberian island in 2012
and when they looked at it at autopsy,

338
00:22:36,970 --> 00:22:40,150
they realize that not only
did it have fur and hair,

339
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:44,530
it had skin and flesh and muscle,

340
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:46,390
and when they cut into it,

341
00:22:46,391 --> 00:22:48,460
I spoke to one of the scientists
who was at the autopsy.

342
00:22:48,461 --> 00:22:51,130
It said it looked like it had fresh meat.

343
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:55,480
It looked like it was a fresh beef steak.
So well preserved was it?

344
00:22:55,780 --> 00:23:00,100
This animal was frozen continuously
for the last 40,000 years.

345
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:04,930
And there are three different groups of
scientist trying to bring back the wooly

346
00:23:04,931 --> 00:23:09,931
mammoth and the first two hoping
to use carcasses like this,

347
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:15,400
get cells from them and use the
DNA inside those cells for cloning.

348
00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:20,530
Right. And that's an amazing
thing to try. However,

349
00:23:20,531 --> 00:23:22,630
as an XL biologist myself,

350
00:23:23,050 --> 00:23:28,030
I'm slightly skeptical
because these mammas had been
frozen for a very long time

351
00:23:28,031 --> 00:23:32,620
with no kind of protective chemicals to
protect the cells like we would do if we

352
00:23:32,621 --> 00:23:34,690
were freezing cells in a lab.

353
00:23:35,650 --> 00:23:39,640
So the cell shatter the DNA leaks away.
It's quite a tall order.

354
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:44,290
But fortunately there is a third group
who were trying to bring back the wooly

355
00:23:44,291 --> 00:23:49,010
mammoth. And if I have to put my
faith in one particular group,

356
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:54,620
it's this group and it's led by a guy
called George Church. He works at Harvard.

357
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:59,390
And my faith in George Church is
based on two particular reasons.

358
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:03,200
The thirsty is that he is a
remarkably intelligent guy.

359
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:06,770
He has a brain the size of the planet,
he is so innovative.

360
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:11,390
He has this amazing genetics lab kitted
out with all the latest stuff and an

361
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:14,750
army of people working for him
who are equally as brilliant.

362
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:20,240
And the secondary reason is that he
has this enormous gray, bushy beard.

363
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,580
So he looks a lot like God.

364
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:26,240
So if I'm gonna put my faith in one group,

365
00:24:26,241 --> 00:24:30,110
it's going to be the one led by the guy
that looks like he would belong on the

366
00:24:30,111 --> 00:24:33,920
roof of the Sistine Chapel.
And he's not trying to clone a mammoth.

367
00:24:34,190 --> 00:24:35,750
He's trying to do something different.

368
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:41,950
So what he's doing is he's
getting elephant cells and
then he's editing mammoth

369
00:24:42,951 --> 00:24:45,500
genes into elephant cells.

370
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:49,220
And he's using this technique of the
moment that's everyone's buzzing about

371
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:54,320
called CRISPR cas nine which enables
scientists to edit genomes with pinpoint

372
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:55,183
precision.

373
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:59,540
So he's taking the genes that made the
mammoth mammoth like in different to

374
00:24:59,541 --> 00:25:02,300
elephants genes that
control the growth of their,

375
00:25:02,301 --> 00:25:05,720
for their big thick rolls
of subcutaneous fat.

376
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:10,010
And they're special hemoglobin that's
steroid oxygen round at low temperatures

377
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:14,810
and they're putting them in to elephant
cells and they're going to use those to

378
00:25:14,811 --> 00:25:18,950
create life. And I wish him
well. And a third project is,

379
00:25:18,951 --> 00:25:21,890
this is centered around this bird,
the passenger pigeon.

380
00:25:21,891 --> 00:25:24,890
Now this is a bird that's really well
known in America where it used to live

381
00:25:24,891 --> 00:25:28,820
before it went extinct. It went extinct
at the beginning of the 20th century.

382
00:25:28,821 --> 00:25:32,060
But before that for tens
of thousands of years,

383
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:37,420
the passenger pigeon existed
in fast mind boggling numbers.

384
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:42,820
It was a beautiful athletic bird and a
flock could contain billions of birds,

385
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:48,200
I thought could be a hundred
miles long and a mile wide.

386
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:53,300
It could take days to pass overhead.
And when it did, it blotted out the sun.

387
00:25:53,810 --> 00:25:57,710
They were like an avian eclipse
and then one day they were gone.

388
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:00,753
Pardon me?

389
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:05,330
And the scientist he's trying to bring
them back is using this same gene editing

390
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:08,870
technology to try and do that and
some very clever cell biology.

391
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:12,020
So there's three of the
projects that are ongoing.

392
00:26:12,021 --> 00:26:16,940
But of course the most
important question is this, why?

393
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:21,260
Why are scientists trying to do
this? What is the point, right?

394
00:26:21,261 --> 00:26:24,200
And that is a really,
it's the most important question to ask.

395
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:28,580
And there are lots of reasons why
personally I think de extinction might be

396
00:26:28,581 --> 00:26:30,800
worth a shot.
The first is this,

397
00:26:30,801 --> 00:26:32,990
if you think about the
animals we've just mentioned,

398
00:26:33,350 --> 00:26:35,450
think about the causes
of their extinction.

399
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:39,950
The gastric brooding frog went extinct
because it's suffered from something

400
00:26:39,951 --> 00:26:42,830
called the caterer had
fungus. And in fact, in fact,

401
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:47,040
amphibians all around the globe are being
affected by this fungus and there's a

402
00:26:47,041 --> 00:26:52,041
massive amphibian die off going on and
we're spreading that fungus around the

403
00:26:52,531 --> 00:26:57,060
globe through the commercial
transport and trade in Amphibians.

404
00:26:57,870 --> 00:27:00,720
Humans were implicated in the
demise of the woolly mammoth.

405
00:27:01,050 --> 00:27:02,850
It may not have been
exclusively our fault,

406
00:27:02,851 --> 00:27:05,670
but we were implicated
and the passenger pigeon,

407
00:27:05,671 --> 00:27:08,370
we shot every single last
one of them out of the sky.

408
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:13,880
So you could argue that where we've
played a role in the downfall of a species

409
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:17,970
and where we have the technology
to do something about it,

410
00:27:18,450 --> 00:27:22,170
maybe we have a moral obligation. And
I think that's an interesting argument.

411
00:27:22,171 --> 00:27:24,840
I think it's good,
but I don't think it's enough.

412
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,690
So when you think about extinctions,

413
00:27:27,691 --> 00:27:30,750
people tend to think about
things from the distant past.

414
00:27:31,230 --> 00:27:33,540
I think about Dodos and dinosaurs,

415
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:37,410
but actually of course extinction
is happening all around us today.

416
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:43,100
We live in a time of mass extinction
where extinction rates are spiking in the

417
00:27:43,471 --> 00:27:46,770
time we've been in this room together
and no other species has gone.

418
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:51,900
And extinction rates are a thousand
times higher than during prehuman times.

419
00:27:52,350 --> 00:27:57,350
So this is our fault and why it's
important is because all living things are

420
00:27:57,471 --> 00:27:58,440
part of an ecosystem.

421
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:02,730
And I think of ecosystems
as games have giant Jenga.

422
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:06,990
You know the game where you stack the
bricks and you have to take them away.

423
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:11,370
What does he take the bricks away?
Or you take the species away for a while,

424
00:28:11,371 --> 00:28:16,020
everything's kind of fine, but then
it gets wobbly and then it crumbles.

425
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:20,730
But because we're in a mass extinction,
a period of mass extinction,

426
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:23,910
it's not just like playing
a game of giant Jenga.

427
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:28,770
It's like playing a game of
giant Jenga with a toddler.

428
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:32,040
It's all going to come crashing down.

429
00:28:35,910 --> 00:28:38,940
So it's important. Think about
what we might learn along the way.

430
00:28:38,941 --> 00:28:43,941
If we could work out how the gastric
brooding frog changed its stomach into a

431
00:28:45,271 --> 00:28:49,440
wound, we might be able to work out
new therapies for stomach ulcers,

432
00:28:49,441 --> 00:28:51,360
people recovering from stomach surgery.

433
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:57,060
And if you go for animals that are unique,
genetically unique,

434
00:28:57,061 --> 00:28:58,260
like the gastric brooding frog,

435
00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:00,840
you don't just put a twig
back on the tree of life.

436
00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:03,480
You replenished an entire branch.

437
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:10,070
So I think for me de extinction is
about restoring lost biodiversity.

438
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:12,541
That's the key.

439
00:29:12,541 --> 00:29:16,810
It's about putting animals to extinction
is not about making lonely is Eric's

440
00:29:16,811 --> 00:29:17,640
habits.

441
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:22,640
It's about making healthy genetically
diverse populations of animals that could

442
00:29:23,101 --> 00:29:27,750
be returned to the wild where they
could interact with their ecosystem in a

443
00:29:27,751 --> 00:29:31,500
positive and meaningful way.
And that is a tall, tall order.

444
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:34,650
We need to think about what we do very,
very carefully.

445
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:38,850
But in my last five minutes I just
like to mention something else.

446
00:29:38,851 --> 00:29:43,480
So I have to extinction is
about increasing biodiversity

447
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:47,950
there.
Maybe it's a form of conservation maybe.

448
00:29:48,250 --> 00:29:51,610
And I put a cup of Chamomile tea
here cause when I make this point,

449
00:29:51,970 --> 00:29:55,090
sometimes I get shouty
tweets from conservationists,

450
00:29:55,091 --> 00:29:59,710
he'd get very angry with me and they
say well the extinction and conservation

451
00:29:59,711 --> 00:30:02,320
that completely distinct,
you can't lump them together.

452
00:30:02,321 --> 00:30:07,321
You can't because conservation is about
helping the living and the extinction is

453
00:30:07,511 --> 00:30:10,720
about the debt.
And I think that is a reasonable point.

454
00:30:10,721 --> 00:30:12,040
I don't have a problem with that.

455
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:16,060
But there are two points that I
make it that the first is this.

456
00:30:18,730 --> 00:30:23,500
If we can get DNA from
museum specimens like this,

457
00:30:23,501 --> 00:30:25,270
surprise looking cat,
right,

458
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:31,900
or from mammoth teeth or from a pickled
Tasmanian Tiger in a jar and we can get

459
00:30:33,371 --> 00:30:34,780
DNA from all these things.

460
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:40,800
If we can take DNA from sales that came
from endangered species that have been

461
00:30:41,141 --> 00:30:42,130
frozen away,

462
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:47,380
if we can get DNA from that and we
can use that DNA to create life,

463
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:53,520
then maybe some types of creatures
aren't quite as extinct as others.

464
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:59,080
Maybe there are different
degrees of extinct tennis.
And I think that's a really,

465
00:30:59,081 --> 00:31:02,620
really interesting concept.
So dinosaurs are well and truly extinct.

466
00:31:02,621 --> 00:31:03,850
They're never coming back,

467
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:08,950
but we've suddenly got this
blurry spectrum between
life and death that didn't

468
00:31:08,951 --> 00:31:13,720
exist before. And that fascinates
me. And the other point is this,

469
00:31:15,190 --> 00:31:18,580
apart from my dog, this is probably
my favorite animal on the planet.

470
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:24,010
This is a northern white rhino and there
were just three of these animals left

471
00:31:24,370 --> 00:31:29,370
three and I live in a wildlife reserve
in Kenya and as a grandfather and mother

472
00:31:32,050 --> 00:31:32,883
and a daughter,

473
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:37,750
but they are too old to l and
two related to breed naturally.

474
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:41,680
So basically they are
functionally extinct.

475
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:46,870
Here are animals that are alive but
that are the walking dead that ghosts.

476
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:51,310
So if we do nothing,
they're extinct already.

477
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:56,950
So I would argue that attempts to bring
back the northern white rhino count as

478
00:31:56,951 --> 00:32:01,600
the extinction is a form of conservation
and there was a guy who works out of

479
00:32:01,610 --> 00:32:03,050
Berlin called Thomas Hildebrandt.

480
00:32:03,470 --> 00:32:07,750
He was doing some amazing work trying
to save the northern white rhino using

481
00:32:07,751 --> 00:32:09,640
some of these new high tech techniques.

482
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:12,520
And I'd like to leave you
with one final thought.

483
00:32:12,521 --> 00:32:15,730
If we're prepared to think
about the extinction,

484
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:19,930
if we're prepared to at least consider
in the future that it might be a positive

485
00:32:19,931 --> 00:32:24,400
force,
I think why stop there?

486
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:28,420
How about if we accept us, we
must, that the world is changing,

487
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:33,790
that it's warming, that habitats
are changing. How about for example,

488
00:32:33,791 --> 00:32:38,791
we use these gene editing techniques
that we have to improve the fate of the

489
00:32:39,291 --> 00:32:41,030
endangered species on our planet.

490
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:46,250
What about if when scientists bring
back the gastric brooding frog,

491
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:51,410
they add in some genes to
make it resistant to the
catch with fungus that would

492
00:32:51,411 --> 00:32:55,880
kill it if we released it into the wild
today. Maybe that's worth thinking about.

493
00:32:57,050 --> 00:33:02,050
Maybe we could engineer fish to be
able to survive rising temperatures.

494
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:06,560
And this is another very cute animal.
This is the black footed ferret.

495
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:11,900
These animals currently all living black
footed ferrets today are descended from

496
00:33:11,901 --> 00:33:14,030
seven founder members.
They're very,

497
00:33:14,031 --> 00:33:19,031
very inbred and there the subjects at
a massive captive breeding project.

498
00:33:19,730 --> 00:33:21,050
But when they're released into the wild,

499
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:23,660
they die because that's a disease
out there that's not billing them.

500
00:33:23,690 --> 00:33:24,830
Cool sylvatic plague.

501
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:30,520
So plans are afoot to edit
genetic diversity back into
the black footed ferret

502
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:37,660
and plans are afoot to edit in genes that
confer resistance to the disease that

503
00:33:38,391 --> 00:33:39,224
is killing it.

504
00:33:39,410 --> 00:33:44,410
And the black footed ferret could
possibly become the very first genetically

505
00:33:45,291 --> 00:33:49,820
altered wild animal.
It's something that the FDA in America,

506
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:53,600
uh, sorry. Not the FDA, the American
authorities are considering.

507
00:33:54,770 --> 00:33:58,700
So there we are de extinction. I don't
want you to go away with a message,

508
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:03,800
but it's about to happen tomorrow. It's
not. But the science is moving at a very,

509
00:34:03,801 --> 00:34:05,330
very quick pace.

510
00:34:05,690 --> 00:34:10,220
And I believe this is possible and de
Extinction won't stop with the birth of

511
00:34:10,221 --> 00:34:13,700
the first healthy deer extinct animal.

512
00:34:14,090 --> 00:34:18,350
That will be the beginning of a long
process that we'll see these animals

513
00:34:18,351 --> 00:34:20,570
nurtured in captivity for a short while.

514
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:24,710
There'll be able to grow up check
to make sure they're healthy,

515
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:28,310
check to see that they can
breed naturally. And then,

516
00:34:28,311 --> 00:34:30,020
and this is the most
difficult parts of all,

517
00:34:30,021 --> 00:34:34,550
probably released into the wild under
the guidance of the colleges where you

518
00:34:34,551 --> 00:34:37,940
would hope they would
flourish and interact with
the environment in a positive

519
00:34:37,941 --> 00:34:38,774
way.

520
00:34:39,050 --> 00:34:44,050
So we have at our fingertips
these incredible processes,

521
00:34:44,630 --> 00:34:46,820
gene editing,
stem cell biology,

522
00:34:46,821 --> 00:34:51,821
assisted reproduction that cannot
only bring back extinct species.

523
00:34:52,490 --> 00:34:56,360
They can also sculpt the
future of life on our planet.

524
00:34:57,260 --> 00:34:58,820
And I'd like to finish with a quote,

525
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:01,580
which I think is particularly
relevant at this point.

526
00:35:02,870 --> 00:35:07,870
I think it was Spiderman's uncle who
wants said with great power comes great

527
00:35:10,431 --> 00:35:15,350
responsibility. So I think
we need to consider our next
move very, very carefully.

528
00:35:15,830 --> 00:35:17,030
Thank you very much for listening.

529
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:22,890
Okay,

530
00:35:24,430 --> 00:35:28,030
so we have some time for
questions and I'll take the money.

531
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:31,990
If you could speak into my
phone, it would be great. Okay.

532
00:35:32,050 --> 00:35:36,760
You say that a human cloning has
understandably been outlawed. Um,

533
00:35:37,410 --> 00:35:38,100
where

534
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:40,110
does the boundary lie?

535
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:43,380
Would we be allowed to be a
DX stinked neanderthals off,

536
00:35:43,381 --> 00:35:47,670
strip it if it gets the
amendment and other such Hobo?

537
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:50,190
That's really interesting actually.

538
00:35:50,191 --> 00:35:54,760
So there's a chapter in the book about
them that you just mentioned. Uh,

539
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:57,420
that includes me under tiles. And it's
very interesting because of course,

540
00:35:57,421 --> 00:36:01,380
human cloning,
human reproductive cloning is widely band,

541
00:36:01,470 --> 00:36:04,650
not in every country, but in most
developed countries and rightly so.

542
00:36:05,370 --> 00:36:09,480
But actually when those laws were being
drawn up and nobody was even thinking

543
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:14,250
about pre humans and they're all
currently, as I understand it,

544
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:19,280
no laws forbidding cloning on the
Undertale because it's not a homo.

545
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:24,700
Now, I think by extension as we
learn more and more about towels,

546
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:27,510
we're learning that these
weren't some primitive savages.

547
00:36:27,930 --> 00:36:30,480
These were very sophisticated
people for their time.

548
00:36:30,810 --> 00:36:34,470
They'd been around much longer than us
and we're capable of doing some amazing

549
00:36:34,471 --> 00:36:37,950
things. They were very, very
human for want of a better word.

550
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:41,010
And I don't think cloning a
neanderthal is a good idea at all.

551
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:46,640
But what's interesting is that we find
the technology in theory is there to make

552
00:36:47,731 --> 00:36:51,630
it happen and currently there's no
legislation in place to stop it from

553
00:36:51,631 --> 00:36:55,280
happening, but no scientist in
their right mind is considering it.

554
00:36:55,281 --> 00:36:58,260
It's I am pleased to say,
and I don't think anybody ever should.

555
00:37:06,290 --> 00:37:06,591
Thanks.

556
00:37:06,591 --> 00:37:11,000
Do you think we should have any concerns
about a number of hybrid species being

557
00:37:11,001 --> 00:37:12,710
produced as a results of gene editing?

558
00:37:14,210 --> 00:37:16,340
Wow,
I think that's an interesting question.

559
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:21,980
If we start putting genes in twin
day and to the species first,

560
00:37:21,981 --> 00:37:25,910
don't, we're not necessarily talking
about putting genes from another species.

561
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:29,330
We're not necessarily talking about
crossing genes between species.

562
00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:34,250
It could be that we find some frogs out
there that already immune to cut trade

563
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:36,230
and we might be able to
use that genetic sequence.

564
00:37:36,231 --> 00:37:39,390
But in fact that was kind of a moot point.
This idea of,

565
00:37:39,470 --> 00:37:44,470
of using gene editing to kind of enhance
wildlife is actually a very logical

566
00:37:44,601 --> 00:37:49,601
extinction to something that happens in
the natural world and in conservation

567
00:37:49,881 --> 00:37:53,720
already. So in the natural world,
hybridization does occur between species,

568
00:37:53,721 --> 00:37:57,710
not often, but it does certainly within
the bird world it's really quite common.

569
00:37:57,711 --> 00:38:01,820
There was a study recently where they
analyze the DNA of a pile of birds and

570
00:38:01,821 --> 00:38:05,590
found suspicious genes that
came from other species. Um,

571
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:10,660
and then the other thing
is that conservationists
are very conservative so I

572
00:38:11,661 --> 00:38:15,290
could name and they tend not to
like things that are terribly new.

573
00:38:15,291 --> 00:38:19,220
But one conservation practice that has
been going on for a long time is that

574
00:38:19,221 --> 00:38:22,520
when populations of animals dwindled
down to very, very low numbers,

575
00:38:22,850 --> 00:38:27,850
what they will do is introduce animals
from a separate population to introduce

576
00:38:28,670 --> 00:38:29,870
genetic diversity.

577
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:33,800
And sometimes that occurs not
necessarily within species,

578
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:35,450
but within the subspecies.

579
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:40,030
So the Florida Panther is kind of a famous
example where the Florida panther was

580
00:38:40,031 --> 00:38:43,390
seriously depleted in
numbers getting desperately.

581
00:38:43,391 --> 00:38:45,670
And Brad and then this is a while ago,

582
00:38:45,671 --> 00:38:50,671
people imported the Texas Panther and
they integrate and things got better as a

583
00:38:51,251 --> 00:38:54,610
result. So this might seem
kind of new and unfamiliar,

584
00:38:54,611 --> 00:38:58,540
but I would argue actually this is
something that happens naturally and

585
00:38:58,541 --> 00:39:02,830
something that one of the scientist said
to me, look, a conservation biologist,

586
00:39:02,860 --> 00:39:03,281
he said,
look,

587
00:39:03,281 --> 00:39:08,140
for years and years people
have been solving this
problem by moving the animals.

588
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:12,580
I'm suggesting we move the jeans.
The end result is probably the same,

589
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:16,210
although maybe if we did it our way, we've
got a little bit more control over it.

590
00:39:19,110 --> 00:39:19,943
I have a question.

591
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:24,870
Is anyone looking at bringing back plant
life or other fauna or flora rather

592
00:39:25,350 --> 00:39:28,020
instead of just foreigner? I didn't
particularly look at plants in the book,

593
00:39:28,050 --> 00:39:31,590
but um, what we have of course
are these amazing seed banks,

594
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:34,760
these repositories of
seeds where they're the,

595
00:39:34,790 --> 00:39:39,270
they're trying to harvest as many seeds
as they can before plants go extinct.

596
00:39:39,271 --> 00:39:42,650
And of course if you've got the seeds,
it's relatively straight forward. Um,

597
00:39:42,690 --> 00:39:45,360
so I don't know about d
extincting plant life,

598
00:39:45,630 --> 00:39:48,090
but going to the other end of the
spectrum where we're thinking about gene

599
00:39:48,091 --> 00:39:51,750
editing, of course GM is
commonplace in the Arab world now,

600
00:39:52,050 --> 00:39:54,760
but the first genetically modified trees,

601
00:39:54,810 --> 00:39:59,810
the American chestnut and that had a
gene from wheat paste it into the gene of

602
00:40:00,001 --> 00:40:04,050
the chestnut tree because it was suffering
from a particular type of blight that

603
00:40:04,051 --> 00:40:06,980
was completely hammering
this type of tree. Um,

604
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:09,780
I'm there now at the stage in the states
now where they're considering they've

605
00:40:09,781 --> 00:40:14,190
got test plots and they're considering
about how they might possibly return the

606
00:40:14,191 --> 00:40:15,024
street to the wild.

607
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:22,500
Do you need DNA from both genders and
also be able to bring those pieces back

608
00:40:23,890 --> 00:40:28,890
and how many individuals Dna do you
need in order to have enough diversity?

609
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:36,180
Do you need a male and a
female? Yes. So, you know,

610
00:40:36,181 --> 00:40:41,181
this depends on us having som
Paul's in museums of mixed genders.

611
00:40:41,281 --> 00:40:42,150
And if we don't,

612
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:47,780
maybe we think about hybridizing say
a northern white rhino with its living

613
00:40:48,481 --> 00:40:49,950
cousin,
the southern White Rhino.

614
00:40:49,951 --> 00:40:52,440
So you might not make a
pure northern white rhino,

615
00:40:52,770 --> 00:40:57,210
but you at least save it's jeans and then
over time you can breed a pure animal

616
00:40:57,211 --> 00:41:01,290
as time goes on. And in terms
of a founding population size,

617
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:03,840
we don't know.
Basically,

618
00:41:03,841 --> 00:41:07,230
it depends on all sorts of things like
the generation time of the animal.

619
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:12,500
So the black footed ferret was presumed
extinct in the 1980s they thought it had

620
00:41:13,081 --> 00:41:16,350
been wiped out by this place that was
killing it and they went out and call

621
00:41:16,351 --> 00:41:19,470
every single last animal they could
find from the plains in Wyoming,

622
00:41:19,990 --> 00:41:21,840
they brought 18 animals into captivity.

623
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:25,440
This was 1989 and it was seen as
this amazing conservation thing.

624
00:41:25,441 --> 00:41:29,940
Nobody had ever gone out there and
captured all the members of species in the

625
00:41:29,941 --> 00:41:33,060
wild and put them in captivity.
It was really radical for his.

626
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:39,280
The problem was that from these 18 found
a members only seven survived and 9,000

627
00:41:40,791 --> 00:41:45,630
ferrets later through this
captive breeding project
that they have ongoing that

628
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:47,570
beginning to show signs of inbreeding,

629
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:53,380
but they have cells from some of the
original animals that were caught but that

630
00:41:54,590 --> 00:41:59,590
for whatever reason didn't manage to
breed and they figure that if they manage

631
00:42:00,021 --> 00:42:05,021
to create new animals from
two of those original animals,

632
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:10,190
they increased the size of the founding
population from seven to nine and they

633
00:42:10,191 --> 00:42:13,790
think that will give them a decent
chance of enough genetic diversity.

634
00:42:15,170 --> 00:42:19,310
But it's a question that
varies from species to species
and genetic diversity is

635
00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:21,950
quite a stochastic random process.

636
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:24,890
So it has a lot to do with a
random shuffling of the genes.

637
00:42:24,891 --> 00:42:26,110
When creatures reproduce,

638
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:30,350
you might be lucky and get away with a
very small founding number or in some

639
00:42:30,351 --> 00:42:31,730
cases it might take a larger one.

640
00:42:34,570 --> 00:42:37,810
Okay, a nice talk. Thank you very
much. Thank you. I have a question.

641
00:42:37,811 --> 00:42:42,160
So you're talking about a lot,
there's a lot of technology to create a,

642
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:44,800
to recreate animals that are extinct.

643
00:42:45,310 --> 00:42:49,680
Do we have debt amount of technology to
like predicting pact of this animal in

644
00:42:49,681 --> 00:42:51,010
the Eh,
in the environment.

645
00:42:51,220 --> 00:42:55,520
Because if we bring back the memos
and we put him somewhere, whatever,

646
00:42:55,630 --> 00:42:57,160
somewhere that would be nice for him.

647
00:42:57,850 --> 00:43:01,390
What can we expect from in destroying
everything else because there is an

648
00:43:01,391 --> 00:43:05,050
imbalance there. Or like the Pgo like if
that, cause we have pigeon problem, right?

649
00:43:05,051 --> 00:43:07,930
There's lots of pigeon.
If we put a new page on there,

650
00:43:08,950 --> 00:43:10,930
what can happen? You can, we,

651
00:43:11,430 --> 00:43:14,380
we have technology
tools to think about it,

652
00:43:14,381 --> 00:43:17,140
to understand what might happen with this,

653
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:20,680
this dead end road coming
back and just want to think,

654
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:25,360
do you think that if someone finds
like is a very big piece of dinosaur,

655
00:43:25,361 --> 00:43:29,710
like the fans from the move, maybe they
can come back. That would be awesome.

656
00:43:30,010 --> 00:43:31,490
Like barn.
Okay.

657
00:43:32,220 --> 00:43:34,940
All right. Well, so
the first question, um,

658
00:43:36,530 --> 00:43:40,010
what day extinction but extinction at the
moment. Is it a process in development?

659
00:43:40,011 --> 00:43:43,370
It's kind of at the cell biology state
and at the create an animal stage.

660
00:43:43,371 --> 00:43:44,690
And what's missing,
in my opinion,

661
00:43:45,050 --> 00:43:48,680
is this kind of long term thinking where
we start thinking about what happens

662
00:43:48,681 --> 00:43:49,880
when these animals are released.

663
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:52,280
And that's not to say that
the thinking's not going on,

664
00:43:52,281 --> 00:43:54,470
but that's a discussion that's
really just starting now.

665
00:43:54,860 --> 00:43:58,790
And we need to cologists brought on in
these discussions from a really early

666
00:43:58,791 --> 00:44:02,000
point. And not only that,
we need Paleo ecologist,

667
00:44:02,001 --> 00:44:05,750
so we need people that have studied
these animals the first time around.

668
00:44:05,780 --> 00:44:06,950
They've looked at their remains,

669
00:44:06,951 --> 00:44:10,130
they've learned from what happened when
this animal was around the first time

670
00:44:10,131 --> 00:44:12,440
around.
And certainly with the passenger pigeon,

671
00:44:12,441 --> 00:44:13,330
that's something that's happening.

672
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:16,490
The Guy who's leading the passenger
pigeon project is a guy called Ben Novak,

673
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:20,150
and he's passionate about the project
and he's gone through all the historical

674
00:44:20,151 --> 00:44:24,560
records and he has a very,
very clear idea of how passenger pigeons,

675
00:44:24,561 --> 00:44:27,290
when they were alive,
interacted with their environment.

676
00:44:27,890 --> 00:44:31,000
So they were like this
swarm of feathered locus.

677
00:44:31,020 --> 00:44:36,000
These birds would land and devastate the
deciduous woodland where they landed,

678
00:44:36,001 --> 00:44:40,110
which doesn't sound great, right? But bear
with me. So they would land on my ass,

679
00:44:40,111 --> 00:44:43,320
they would topple trees, they would
cover the forest floor in Guano.

680
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:47,370
But from that apparent devastation
came life. So we're stagnant.

681
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:52,400
Closed canopy woodland turned into one
that was sunlit and the Guano fertilize

682
00:44:52,621 --> 00:44:57,240
the ground and it paved the
way for the growth of, uh,

683
00:44:57,270 --> 00:44:58,650
all sorts of different plants,

684
00:44:58,980 --> 00:45:01,740
which brought in insects and
small mammals and amphibians,

685
00:45:01,741 --> 00:45:03,900
which brought in big Grazers,
which brought in predators.

686
00:45:04,620 --> 00:45:07,220
And he's modeled this whole thing very,
very carefully.

687
00:45:07,330 --> 00:45:12,330
And he is pretty confident that because
the passenger patrion was such a key

688
00:45:13,411 --> 00:45:14,610
stone species,

689
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:20,220
it's actions had these repercussions
across the entire landscape that if you

690
00:45:20,221 --> 00:45:22,380
introduced it back into that environment,

691
00:45:22,650 --> 00:45:25,670
it would drive this
recycling of the unknown.

692
00:45:25,710 --> 00:45:30,240
The eastern North American forest that
has been absent since it's been gone.

693
00:45:30,750 --> 00:45:34,890
But that's something we need to think
about really carefully. You know,

694
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:36,900
ultimately we don't know.

695
00:45:37,710 --> 00:45:41,580
And ultimately we need to build that
in to the release of these animals.

696
00:45:42,210 --> 00:45:44,700
We also need to think about our get
out plan for these animals. You know,

697
00:45:44,701 --> 00:45:45,241
the world is,

698
00:45:45,241 --> 00:45:49,440
is read riddled with invasive species
that are causing their responsible for

699
00:45:49,441 --> 00:45:52,800
most of the extinctions that
are happening. Certainly
on islands there are big,

700
00:45:52,801 --> 00:45:53,341
big problem.

701
00:45:53,341 --> 00:45:57,600
You don't want anything that you go
to all this trouble of creating to be

702
00:45:57,601 --> 00:46:00,090
considered a pest.
You don't have to kill it again.

703
00:46:00,750 --> 00:46:03,270
So these are things that we need
to think about really carefully.

704
00:46:03,271 --> 00:46:04,980
And I hope that answers
the first question.

705
00:46:05,430 --> 00:46:07,500
And the second question is with dinosaurs.

706
00:46:07,770 --> 00:46:10,990
There's a lady called Mary
Schweitzer in America who is, um,

707
00:46:11,910 --> 00:46:16,910
she studies dinosaur bones and she seen
these really tantalizing glimpses of

708
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:24,270
biological molecules inside dinosaur
bones. So I wouldn't call them proteins,

709
00:46:24,271 --> 00:46:26,610
but she sees signs of proteins,

710
00:46:26,970 --> 00:46:31,970
she sees signs of sounds and our
results are pretty controversial and yet

711
00:46:33,151 --> 00:46:36,360
they're beginning to be backed
up by some other groups.

712
00:46:36,570 --> 00:46:40,140
There was a group at UCL last
year who found something similar.

713
00:46:40,980 --> 00:46:44,190
People haven't really looked in dinosaur
bones for these kinds of biological

714
00:46:44,191 --> 00:46:48,270
molecules because we've been taught at
school that they are in a, it's a mineral,

715
00:46:48,271 --> 00:46:53,130
that they're inorganic. But that dogma
is potentially beginning to change now.

716
00:46:53,430 --> 00:46:55,230
And she went even further.
Cause for her,

717
00:46:55,231 --> 00:46:58,950
of course the natural progression
is to say could DNA be in there?

718
00:46:59,730 --> 00:47:04,730
And she ran some tests on some quite
ancient dinosaur bones and sees signs of

719
00:47:07,411 --> 00:47:11,910
DNA. So I'm not saying there's DNA
there, but she saw a signature of DNA.

720
00:47:12,150 --> 00:47:13,170
However,

721
00:47:13,650 --> 00:47:17,190
it's one thing for DNA maybe
to be there in fossils,

722
00:47:17,191 --> 00:47:19,320
which is questionable fossils of that age.

723
00:47:19,650 --> 00:47:22,080
It's quite another for it
to be in any usable form.

724
00:47:23,100 --> 00:47:26,820
And I don't think we will ever get DNA
in a usable form from dinosaur bones.

725
00:47:26,970 --> 00:47:30,460
You have to be able to
reconstruct the genetic sequence,

726
00:47:30,461 --> 00:47:34,090
the genome to give you that set
of instructions to create life.

727
00:47:34,091 --> 00:47:37,870
And would you like a pet dinosaur?
Me Too.

728
00:47:37,900 --> 00:47:41,320
But sadly we're going to have to fell
for dogs and bring them into be back.

729
00:47:41,321 --> 00:47:43,690
We're getting dogs to work and
dinosaurs that could get messy.

730
00:47:46,700 --> 00:47:49,860
Alright. Thanks a lot for your time.
Thank you for thinking of engaging. Uh,

731
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:53,250
I have one question. It seems like the
biggest problem is having a source of DNA,

732
00:47:53,380 --> 00:47:57,100
again from dangerous features, dishes.
Are we doing anything to treat?

733
00:47:57,101 --> 00:48:01,140
I sort of bank for the future because if
it's not today, it's might be 100 years.

734
00:48:01,170 --> 00:48:03,510
This techniques will be finalized on work.

735
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:07,830
So are we thinking about building this
instead of relying on single museums than

736
00:48:07,831 --> 00:48:10,920
might have one species DNA
or something like that?

737
00:48:10,950 --> 00:48:12,360
Are we doing something more global?

738
00:48:13,150 --> 00:48:17,560
Yeah, so we've got this massive
repository of DNA in museums,

739
00:48:19,150 --> 00:48:23,110
but it's much better to have frozen cells
because then you've got something that

740
00:48:23,111 --> 00:48:25,210
is alive that you can start with.

741
00:48:25,211 --> 00:48:30,130
It's far easier to start with DNA inside
a living cell than DNA inside a stuffed

742
00:48:30,131 --> 00:48:33,760
museum specimen. So the museum
specimens are kind of like a,

743
00:48:33,761 --> 00:48:35,770
a source of last recourse if you like.

744
00:48:36,250 --> 00:48:39,790
What is really important are the viable
cells that are frozen and thoughts of

745
00:48:39,791 --> 00:48:40,624
liquid nitrogen.

746
00:48:40,870 --> 00:48:44,410
And there are multiple initiatives all
around the world are doing exactly what

747
00:48:44,411 --> 00:48:45,244
you're thinking of.

748
00:48:45,460 --> 00:48:49,510
The biggest one is at the San Diego Zoo
in America where they have something

749
00:48:49,511 --> 00:48:54,070
called the frozen zoo and three
of those either but also three,

750
00:48:54,071 --> 00:48:57,130
many other zoos and wildlife
collections around the world.

751
00:48:57,970 --> 00:49:02,970
They send body parts to San Diego Zoo
and they culture these cells and they

752
00:49:03,910 --> 00:49:04,360
freeze them.

753
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:07,480
And I heard the guy who leads this is a
guy called Oliver Ryder and I heard him

754
00:49:07,481 --> 00:49:11,650
speak last year and he says he's always
getting interesting things in the post.

755
00:49:11,651 --> 00:49:16,000
So partly there was some Orca at seaworld
or somewhere that had just given birth

756
00:49:16,270 --> 00:49:19,840
and they grabbed the umbilical cord and
they packed it into her eyes and they

757
00:49:19,841 --> 00:49:22,690
sent it to him when they called yourself
from that and they froze them down.

758
00:49:23,020 --> 00:49:23,853
So yes,

759
00:49:24,100 --> 00:49:28,630
and that's the interesting thing that
if we have these frozen cells in liquid

760
00:49:28,631 --> 00:49:33,040
nitrogen, you have a species
maybe in Stacey's not quite alive,

761
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:35,140
not quite dead.
I mean clearly heard his dad,

762
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:38,110
but it's not as dead as some other things.
So yes,

763
00:49:38,170 --> 00:49:42,970
people are trying to collect as much
biodiversity as they possibly can and

764
00:49:42,971 --> 00:49:46,180
squirrel it away for a rainy day.
And it's not just, they're actually,

765
00:49:46,181 --> 00:49:49,690
I should say the main points of these
things is not really there for bringing

766
00:49:49,691 --> 00:49:50,790
animals,
but to lock it.

767
00:49:51,250 --> 00:49:56,250
The main reason for the cells being
collected is to use them as a source of

768
00:49:56,351 --> 00:49:59,260
learning. They used in research
papers all around the world,

769
00:49:59,650 --> 00:50:02,800
but by studying DNA
from endangered species,

770
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:05,680
you get an idea of the health
of these endangered species.

771
00:50:05,681 --> 00:50:07,990
You can see if they're going
through a genetic bottleneck,

772
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:12,880
it can give you some idea of how to manage
your captive breeding programs so the

773
00:50:12,881 --> 00:50:17,881
cells that are being frozen away are
being used for all sorts of excellent

774
00:50:17,950 --> 00:50:22,180
purposes and de extinction is maybe just
a glint in the eye somewhere off to the

775
00:50:22,181 --> 00:50:25,270
side of that, but it could be
used for that in the future.

776
00:50:30,710 --> 00:50:31,543
Hey,

777
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:36,800
we got the same on the same line.

778
00:50:37,220 --> 00:50:39,570
It's just a,
is it just going to be edited?

779
00:50:40,770 --> 00:50:45,690
It's going to be a muffin or an Lmr.
No, you're quite right. It won't be.

780
00:50:45,691 --> 00:50:48,750
If Georgia church has his way,
he's not easy not calling it a mammoth.

781
00:50:48,990 --> 00:50:53,120
He's saying he's making a cold adapted
elephant. He's making an elephant, his,

782
00:50:53,310 --> 00:50:53,931
his creature.

783
00:50:53,931 --> 00:50:57,330
And I should also say none
of these creatures that get
to extincted if and when

784
00:50:57,331 --> 00:51:00,990
that happens, we'll be the same as the
original. It's been many, many reasons,

785
00:51:01,350 --> 00:51:04,050
many reasons. One of the
reasons is their genetic makeup.

786
00:51:04,530 --> 00:51:07,650
So George Church is an extreme
example where he will end up,

787
00:51:07,651 --> 00:51:11,280
if he succeeds in his quest with
an animal that is genetically,

788
00:51:11,340 --> 00:51:15,690
overwhelmingly elephant with a
little sprinkling of mammoth DNA.

789
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:18,480
But he says, well, Hey, I'm
completely fine with that.

790
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:23,670
So long as this animal acts like a
wooly mammoth and can perform the same

791
00:51:23,671 --> 00:51:27,690
ecological role as a woolly mammoth
when we put it back. So in to Siberia.

792
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:30,720
And I don't have a problem with that
and that's the way the day extinction

793
00:51:30,721 --> 00:51:34,650
community feels. It's not about
creating an absolute replica.

794
00:51:34,980 --> 00:51:39,430
It's about something that will
fulfill a lost ecological niche out.

795
00:51:39,490 --> 00:51:43,900
A really quick question about the, uh,
the pregnancy or the surrogacy rather, um,

796
00:51:44,460 --> 00:51:48,410
say for example, with the,
with the Baccato was, how
do you select the animal to,

797
00:51:48,420 --> 00:51:51,900
to kind of carry the Dakota go to
time? Is it something, is it a seminar,

798
00:51:51,901 --> 00:51:56,130
mountain goat with you know that she has
a lot of the DNA or also for the woolly

799
00:51:56,131 --> 00:52:00,810
mammoth, would that potentially
be an elephant or how, how
does that process, yeah,

800
00:52:00,811 --> 00:52:04,980
what you need to do is you need to find
the closest living relative. So, you know,

801
00:52:04,981 --> 00:52:08,220
I said it's great if you can bring back
an animal that is genetically distinct,

802
00:52:08,550 --> 00:52:09,440
but of course the,
the,

803
00:52:09,441 --> 00:52:12,180
the problem there is that if it is
genetically distinct and unique,

804
00:52:12,181 --> 00:52:13,470
what do you use as a surrogate?

805
00:52:14,070 --> 00:52:16,530
Which is where something like a frog is
great because you don't need a surrogate.

806
00:52:17,030 --> 00:52:17,340
You know,

807
00:52:17,340 --> 00:52:20,670
you could if you don't need a you and
you've removed a whole lot of problems.

808
00:52:21,030 --> 00:52:24,610
Now with the big Cardo, they used
obviously an existing type of goat.

809
00:52:24,630 --> 00:52:28,860
They had to create a particular hybrid
because they'd be Kardos closest living

810
00:52:28,861 --> 00:52:33,540
relative ended up being really flirty
and difficult to look after in captivity.

811
00:52:33,541 --> 00:52:37,560
And it literally climbed the
walls and were so neurotic.

812
00:52:37,580 --> 00:52:38,550
I couldn't work with that.

813
00:52:38,790 --> 00:52:43,740
So they created a hybrid guy where they
bred it's closest living relative with a

814
00:52:43,741 --> 00:52:47,310
domestic goat. And found that that worked
really well as a surrogate. So I mean,

815
00:52:47,311 --> 00:52:49,860
when I, when I give these
talks, you only get,

816
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:54,960
you don't get a flavor of the huge amount
of research and effort that goes into

817
00:52:55,321 --> 00:52:56,001
what happens.

818
00:52:56,001 --> 00:52:59,430
So just choosing the right surrogate and
getting it to work was massive for the

819
00:52:59,431 --> 00:53:01,860
Bucardo team.
And yet with a wooly mammoth,

820
00:53:01,861 --> 00:53:06,861
my big problem with a wooly mammoth is
that it involves using elephant eggs,

821
00:53:07,380 --> 00:53:12,120
which are in really, really short
supply and elephants as surrogates. Now,

822
00:53:12,121 --> 00:53:15,600
there is one potential way around
getting hold of elephant eggs.

823
00:53:16,050 --> 00:53:19,770
Scientists are now in this position
where they can take skin cells,

824
00:53:20,430 --> 00:53:25,430
we program them into stem cells
and use them to generate and sperm,

825
00:53:26,370 --> 00:53:30,210
right? So that potentially is a very
exciting tool we have at our fingertips.

826
00:53:30,330 --> 00:53:34,260
It's been demonstrated in mice at
the whole process, hasn't been shown,

827
00:53:34,261 --> 00:53:37,830
particularly for endangered species,
but people are working on that.

828
00:53:37,831 --> 00:53:42,150
So maybe we can get hold
of a load of elephant eggs,
perform these techniques on,

829
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:46,620
but then you still need a surrogate. And
I don't feel good about that. You know,

830
00:53:46,650 --> 00:53:49,170
elephants are seriously in danger.

831
00:53:49,230 --> 00:53:53,550
They're not experimental animals.
And George Church, who was amazing,

832
00:53:53,551 --> 00:53:58,500
we'll say to you, come on.
Think bigger. Think bigger.
Think, think artificial womb.

833
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:00,140
Okay?

834
00:54:00,140 --> 00:54:02,930
Until we get to that point, or until
the elephants out of it, you know what?

835
00:54:02,931 --> 00:54:05,690
I'm never going to be comfortable with
using an elephant as a surrogate. For me,

836
00:54:05,691 --> 00:54:08,120
that is a massive stumbling
block with a wooly mammoth.

837
00:54:08,630 --> 00:54:11,630
And we need to think about
the repercussions of every,

838
00:54:11,810 --> 00:54:16,400
we can't sacrifice one endangered species
to bring back another from the dead.

839
00:54:16,850 --> 00:54:19,610
So will all of these questions need
to be thought about really deeply

840
00:54:21,820 --> 00:54:23,960
with that.
Please join me in a massive unopposed

841
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:29,480
[inaudible].
