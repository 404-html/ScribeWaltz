1
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:11,340
Thank you all for uh, for being
here. Um, it's uh, yeah, I'm, I'm,

2
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:14,010
I'm glad to be here too. Um, so I'm
going to be talking about translation.

3
00:00:14,011 --> 00:00:17,610
Translation is a huge topic that people
can come out from lots of different

4
00:00:17,611 --> 00:00:19,170
angles.
Um,

5
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:22,470
I imagine this is quite a multilingual
and transnational kind of audience. Is it,

6
00:00:22,471 --> 00:00:26,090
I mean Google is obviously a
hugely international company. Um,

7
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:30,540
so translation and communication between
languages I guess is something that is

8
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:33,700
important in your organization,
in your working lives. Um,

9
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:37,440
I'm going to try and mainly talk about
things that are different from that. Um,

10
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:41,150
what I'm going to do is say a
little bit about, uh, you know,

11
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:42,900
a bit more about who I am
and where I'm coming from.

12
00:00:42,901 --> 00:00:47,640
So my interest in how I got interested
in the field of translation.

13
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:52,170
Then I'm going to look at various
different instances of practices of moving

14
00:00:52,171 --> 00:00:52,981
between languages,

15
00:00:52,981 --> 00:00:56,760
which couldn't get called translation
because I think one of the things to see

16
00:00:56,761 --> 00:00:59,610
and thinking about translation is that
there are lots of different kinds of

17
00:00:59,611 --> 00:01:01,500
thing that couldn't
get called translation.

18
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:04,740
So what we're really dealing with
here is an umbrella word with lots of

19
00:01:04,741 --> 00:01:05,590
different,
um,

20
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:10,870
ways of doing things that are different
and important ways that nevertheless all

21
00:01:10,871 --> 00:01:13,290
get called translation.
Um,

22
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:16,890
then I'm going to try to think a bit
about the relationship between translation

23
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:21,840
and languages because if
you've got translation, then
you have to have languages.

24
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:24,060
But what is the language anyway?
Um,

25
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:27,690
and how does the practice that we call
or the range of practices that we call

26
00:01:27,691 --> 00:01:32,520
translation relate to the kind of range
of phenomena that we call languages.

27
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:37,650
Um, and then I'm going to ask how
things might be changing, um, now. Um,

28
00:01:37,651 --> 00:01:40,530
and I hope you'll be able to help me
with that because obviously the internet

29
00:01:40,531 --> 00:01:41,970
and what Google does is a huge part of,

30
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:46,230
of how the whole landscape
of communication is
changing at the moment. Um,

31
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:49,950
so what, why is this interesting to
me? So I'm a literary person. Um,

32
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:54,360
I write novels is Yon said, and I
also write literary historical books.

33
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,830
So when I was a kid I was
interested in just in reading. Um,

34
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:02,250
and then I did the very typical thing that
happens in the UK, which is so, I mean,

35
00:02:02,251 --> 00:02:03,780
it's not really a monolingual culture,

36
00:02:03,781 --> 00:02:06,930
but there are large stretches
of UK culture, which, you know,

37
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:08,640
are predominantly monolingual.

38
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:12,000
So I did the thing that's very typical
for a kid in the UK. He likes reading.

39
00:02:12,001 --> 00:02:15,580
I went to university and I found myself
studying a subject called English, um,

40
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:19,410
without having really, you know, realize
that that was what was going to happen.

41
00:02:19,411 --> 00:02:22,680
So when I was a teenager, I
liked reading books, you know,

42
00:02:22,681 --> 00:02:23,580
from lots of different places.

43
00:02:23,581 --> 00:02:26,790
And they didn't really matter
to me whether they were
in translation or not. Um,

44
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:31,620
and I found myself in a university
structure, um, that was set up,

45
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:34,380
uh, in, I mean, this
happened to be in Cambridge,

46
00:02:34,381 --> 00:02:37,680
but it could have been in many other
universities and institutional structure

47
00:02:37,681 --> 00:02:41,040
that was set up early in the 20th
century when the idea of Englishness and

48
00:02:41,041 --> 00:02:45,000
creating an English national identity
was really important. And so the notion,

49
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:48,820
the attachment, the idea that what you
should read is kind of English books, uh,

50
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,830
was quite a sort of dominant.
Um,

51
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:53,740
idea there as it also is in the university
where I teach now, which is awesome.

52
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:59,140
Um, what I found myself getting interested
in was writers who weren't really very

53
00:02:59,141 --> 00:03:01,150
English at all.
So I found myself getting interested,

54
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:04,510
particularly in some writers from
the mid 19th century. For instance,

55
00:03:04,511 --> 00:03:08,170
Robert Browning, I don't know if you,
you know any of his poems, but, uh,

56
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:11,470
he's the right, he very much likes
setting his poems in foreign countries,

57
00:03:11,471 --> 00:03:15,450
especially Italy. Um, and
setting them in the past. Um,

58
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:19,090
and creating a setup in which you have
to imagine that the person is speaking.

59
00:03:19,091 --> 00:03:22,420
The poem is speaking quite a different
language is speaking, you know,

60
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,470
the sort of Italian,

61
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:28,000
the Italian spoke in the 16th century
and the other words on the page are

62
00:03:28,001 --> 00:03:28,834
English words.

63
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:32,860
And so there's a sort of silent implicit
translation that's part of what's going

64
00:03:32,861 --> 00:03:34,930
on in the poem. Um, and indeed,

65
00:03:34,931 --> 00:03:37,810
another thing about what branding
does is that he writes, you know,

66
00:03:37,811 --> 00:03:39,550
like many poets,
many literary writers,

67
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:43,120
he uses language in strange
and surprising ways. Um,

68
00:03:43,121 --> 00:03:44,950
and part of how he came to do this,

69
00:03:44,951 --> 00:03:49,951
it struck me is that he's very interested
in taking ways of using language from

70
00:03:50,651 --> 00:03:54,100
other languages and trying to bring
them into English. So for instance,

71
00:03:54,101 --> 00:03:59,101
there's a poem from 1855 called an
epistle containing the strange medical

72
00:03:59,381 --> 00:04:03,550
experience of Car Sheesh, the Arab
physician, a branding doesn't know Arabic,

73
00:04:03,551 --> 00:04:06,340
but he's got a sense of
what Arabic, um, is like.

74
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:11,110
And he tries to write his English
in such a way that it has a kind of

75
00:04:11,111 --> 00:04:13,720
strangeness about it. So for
instance, there'll be lines,

76
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:16,570
the speaker will say things like,
instead of saying, I arrived at Jericho,

77
00:04:16,571 --> 00:04:20,170
the speaker will say,
my journeyman's were brought to Jericho.

78
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,140
And what I got interested in was,
you know,

79
00:04:23,141 --> 00:04:25,870
and that's quite as a
piece of literary writing.

80
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:28,840
That's a strange and interesting line,

81
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:32,920
but it's come to be like
that through translation.

82
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:36,820
And so what I was noticing increasingly
in the stuff I was reading and getting

83
00:04:36,821 --> 00:04:41,080
interested in was an overlap between
translation and literary creativity.

84
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:45,130
When you look at a literary texts, you
wanted to do something new in language.

85
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:47,760
And quite often actually,
you know,

86
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:52,660
surprisingly often new stylistic things
were being done in language through

87
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:56,410
either actual translation or sort of
being aware of what another language would

88
00:04:56,411 --> 00:04:59,830
be like. So I had that, but
then I also had this in my mind,

89
00:04:59,831 --> 00:05:04,120
this sort of cliche that there is around
in the culture that translations are

90
00:05:04,121 --> 00:05:08,260
never as good as the original literature
always loses something in translation.

91
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:13,350
Poetry is what is lost in translation
as the American poet Robert Frost is,

92
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:18,690
is reported as having is
reported as having said,

93
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,340
I thought it Google of all
places we wouldn't have this
kind of problem with the

94
00:05:21,341 --> 00:05:26,200
Avl, but hey, it's nice
to know. Um, anyway,

95
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,860
uh, yeah, so that was one thing. Then the,

96
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:34,180
the other thing is that when
I started writing fiction,

97
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:35,980
so,
um,

98
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:41,040
I grew up in a completely monolingual
standard English speaking household in

99
00:05:41,111 --> 00:05:42,490
London.
Um,

100
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:46,630
but my parents were scientists and so
they spoke actually a language that was

101
00:05:46,631 --> 00:05:47,680
quite strange to me.

102
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:50,440
Lots of scientific words that I didn't
understand when I was a kid and I still

103
00:05:50,441 --> 00:05:53,830
don't really understand.
Um,

104
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:55,930
and I found that when I
started writing fiction,

105
00:05:55,931 --> 00:06:00,860
I was interested in using kinds of English
that weren't universally compensable.

106
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:04,940
Um, so Maura, or at least
are a bit peculiar. Um,

107
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:07,910
so my first novel is in the
voice of an interior designer.

108
00:06:07,911 --> 00:06:10,570
He uses lots of interior design jargon.
Um,

109
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:14,300
and I was interested in the sort
of distinctiveness of that voice.

110
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:17,240
And my second novel has got a cause.
My family of doctors,

111
00:06:17,241 --> 00:06:20,150
my second novel has got,
it's very much in the mind of a doctor.

112
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:24,200
And I was interested in that
special language that doctors know,

113
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:27,920
that allows them to describe the world
and understand things about people that,

114
00:06:27,921 --> 00:06:30,680
you know, people just be ordinary
English like me, can't do.

115
00:06:30,681 --> 00:06:33,650
So I kind of mucked up on frantically
mugged up and lots of medical terminology

116
00:06:33,651 --> 00:06:37,760
in order to, um, in order
to create this character.

117
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:42,050
So what I realized I was working
with there was the feeling that, um,

118
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:44,420
English isn't just a language.

119
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:49,600
English is a whole range of different
ways of using the language and actually to

120
00:06:50,211 --> 00:06:53,210
move, you know, one
encounters I encounter,

121
00:06:53,211 --> 00:06:57,950
everybody encounters kinds of languages.
The counters, one's own language,

122
00:06:58,270 --> 00:07:02,120
you know, a kind of languages that counts
as English that I don't understand.

123
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:04,580
And that's an experience
that happens the whole time.

124
00:07:04,581 --> 00:07:06,080
It happens when I'm talking to my kids.

125
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:09,380
It happens when I'm talking to someone
who knows the technical language that I

126
00:07:09,381 --> 00:07:10,214
don't know.

127
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:15,050
So I got interested in how it translation
can also happen within the things that

128
00:07:15,051 --> 00:07:19,540
we think of as, as being languages,
not just between them. Um,

129
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,860
but alongside that,
um,

130
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,450
there's quite a while it seems to me
quite a loose way of thinking that says,

131
00:07:26,451 --> 00:07:29,570
well, everything is translation. Really.
All communication is translation.

132
00:07:29,571 --> 00:07:31,820
You find people,
this is a donor if you come across this,

133
00:07:31,821 --> 00:07:35,300
but this is the sort of
phrase that floats around.

134
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:39,500
And I don't like that phrase because
as soon as you expand a word enormously

135
00:07:39,501 --> 00:07:43,220
like that, expand it metaphorically
like that, it loses all or meaning.

136
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:47,140
But I found that I was interested
in, you know, um, I've,

137
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:49,310
I was nevertheless though,
um,

138
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:53,660
I was interested in the
idea that translation can
happen within a language as

139
00:07:53,661 --> 00:07:55,550
well as between it.
Um,

140
00:07:55,551 --> 00:08:00,551
so those really are the two or the other
to sort of overarching questions that I

141
00:08:00,951 --> 00:08:02,270
bring with me to the topic.

142
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:07,690
One is everyone thinks that poetry is
lost in translation and yet my experiences

143
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:11,560
that you can create poetry
through translation. Um,

144
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:15,590
the other one is I don't really like the
phrase or communication and translation

145
00:08:15,591 --> 00:08:17,510
because I feel it's meaningless.
Nevertheless,

146
00:08:17,511 --> 00:08:22,511
I'm really interested in the idea that
translation happens within a language,

147
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:23,511
you know,

148
00:08:23,511 --> 00:08:26,960
between different kinds of the same
language as well as between different

149
00:08:26,961 --> 00:08:31,730
languages. Um, okay. So what I'm
going to, uh, yeah, so that's, that's,

150
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:35,340
that's sort of a, that that's
kind of where I'm coming from now.

151
00:08:35,341 --> 00:08:38,210
What I want to do now.
I've had a little drink.

152
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:44,090
He's just though cause some instances
of things that some as it were,

153
00:08:44,091 --> 00:08:45,860
scenes of translation,
uh,

154
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:50,300
from different moments and different
cultural places and different moments in

155
00:08:50,301 --> 00:08:54,920
history just to get a sense of the
variety of the field as it were.

156
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:58,080
Um,
so the first one is the school classroom.

157
00:08:58,081 --> 00:09:00,990
And this is where I learned my language
is, and maybe this is a kind of familiar,

158
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:04,140
a familiar environment to many of you.

159
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:09,390
So in a classroom or you're in an exam
hall as here and there's a passage of a

160
00:09:09,391 --> 00:09:13,860
foreign language on the whiteboard or
on the blackboard or on the text and you

161
00:09:13,861 --> 00:09:18,861
have to translate it and your translation
is going to be marked by the teacher

162
00:09:19,261 --> 00:09:24,000
or the examiner. Um, so you're going to
get ticks and crosses and you'll get,

163
00:09:24,001 --> 00:09:25,560
you'll get a mark as a result of that.

164
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:31,400
So what's happening in this instance of
translation or this scene of translation

165
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:35,610
is firstly it's subject to discipline.
Um,

166
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:39,210
and I think as soon as you're using the
word translation questions of right and

167
00:09:39,211 --> 00:09:41,790
wrong or better and worse kind
of come into the room as well.

168
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:46,380
So the idea of translation, the idea
of discipline kind of belong together.

169
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:52,550
The other general point I want to bring
from this particular context is that the

170
00:09:52,921 --> 00:09:57,921
kind of translation that school kids or
students do in order to show that they

171
00:09:58,231 --> 00:10:02,010
know the language is a very,
is a particular kind of thing.

172
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:05,370
So the teacher is marking it
and the teacher is saying,

173
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:09,570
can I tell from this translation that the
student has understood the text in the

174
00:10:09,571 --> 00:10:10,650
original language?
Well enough.

175
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:15,180
And so in that environment you're doing
something that's called translation,

176
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:20,010
but what's controlling what you actually
do is the need to show the teacher that

177
00:10:20,011 --> 00:10:21,630
you're understood the foreign language.

178
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:25,410
And that means that lots of kind of
freedom that say literary translators,

179
00:10:25,411 --> 00:10:27,780
translators of novels or translator,

180
00:10:27,781 --> 00:10:31,990
he's just somebody speaking in somebody
else's speaking to interpret orally. Um,

181
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:34,930
that the kinds of of of,
uh,

182
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:39,600
thing that in those circumstances you're
able to do in a school or university

183
00:10:39,601 --> 00:10:39,871
setting,

184
00:10:39,871 --> 00:10:43,800
you are not able to do because you're
subject to this discipline of showing that

185
00:10:43,801 --> 00:10:47,190
you've understood this grammatical form
and this phrase and this idiom and so on.

186
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:50,700
And that's why the kinds of translations
that get done in school context,

187
00:10:50,701 --> 00:10:54,690
we'll get done in academic contexts often,
you know, read and quite a stilted way.

188
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:59,160
Um, because they're not
being designed to be read.

189
00:10:59,161 --> 00:11:02,880
They're being designed for this
particular, um, academic exercise.

190
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:06,570
So the general points I wanted to get
from that are there translations and we're

191
00:11:06,571 --> 00:11:10,680
just into our language. Um, it's
being done in a particular context,

192
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:16,080
subject to a set of particular
expectations for a particular purpose.

193
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:17,281
Um,
so,

194
00:11:17,281 --> 00:11:19,500
and those were always things when you're
thinking about what's going on in any

195
00:11:19,501 --> 00:11:23,160
instance of translation,
those are always things that are going to,

196
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:24,270
or that you need to bear in mind.

197
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:28,850
I want to briefly to contrast this
with a much kind of freer, um, or,

198
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:33,360
or kind of multilingual, um, kind
of context moving across languages.

199
00:11:33,361 --> 00:11:34,290
So say you've got a group of,

200
00:11:34,291 --> 00:11:36,770
I mean as I guess happens in
this building quite a lot.

201
00:11:36,771 --> 00:11:39,840
Let's say you've got a
group of people speaking,

202
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:43,560
they all know different languages.
You want to communicate, um,

203
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:46,200
you want to find a shared
medium of communication.

204
00:11:46,201 --> 00:11:48,000
Maybe English is the shared language,

205
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:51,810
but the people speaking are coming
from different languages into English

206
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:54,790
speaking English or speaking
English in slightly different ways.

207
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:58,300
And you sort of negotiate a medium
of understanding, don't you?

208
00:11:58,301 --> 00:12:01,060
So say there's an Italian speaker and
the Italian speaker might say to the

209
00:12:01,061 --> 00:12:01,271
English,

210
00:12:01,271 --> 00:12:05,260
speaking in Bocca Lupo in Bocca Lupo
is an Italian way of saying good luck.

211
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,120
Literally it means in
the mouth of the wolf.

212
00:12:07,121 --> 00:12:10,390
Then your speaker might not understand.
The Italian speaker might explain,

213
00:12:10,391 --> 00:12:12,550
the French speaker might say,
you know,

214
00:12:12,551 --> 00:12:15,400
Marshalls or something
and you'd have a kind of,

215
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:18,430
on the one hand are kind
of coming to understand,

216
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:23,410
but on the other hand is sort of
freer area of language mixing,

217
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:26,710
which is quite different
from the classroom setting.

218
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:32,370
So that's showing how what happens across
languages can be quite different in a,

219
00:12:32,681 --> 00:12:35,470
in a, in, in a different setting.
The other thing it's showing,

220
00:12:35,471 --> 00:12:38,410
which I'm not sure how much
I'm going to talk about,

221
00:12:38,411 --> 00:12:42,430
but maybe we can talk about in
discussion at the end. Um, yeah,

222
00:12:42,431 --> 00:12:44,020
we'll talk about it.
And discussion at the end is the,

223
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:48,130
the real importance of the difference
between spoken language and how people

224
00:12:48,131 --> 00:12:53,050
behave with their voices and written
language and how people move across

225
00:12:53,051 --> 00:12:57,040
languages when they're dealing
with writing. Um, or on a
screen. And actually the,

226
00:12:57,041 --> 00:12:57,880
the, the, you know,

227
00:12:57,890 --> 00:13:02,560
the Internet was obviously blurring
that distinction to some extent. Um,

228
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:06,370
but I'm just going to leave that there
for the moment. Um, and come back to it.

229
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:11,500
Now. My next example is from
back in the 16th century.

230
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:16,840
Um, and who we have here is the sultan.

231
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:22,080
Um, the Ottoman sultan in Constantinople
Sultan Murad the third. Um,

232
00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:25,680
and we have Queen Elizabeth
the first of England. Um,

233
00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:29,560
and they're writing letters to each other
or they're in diplomatic communication.

234
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:35,820
Um, and um, the way that works is that,

235
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:41,080
um, no one really in the Turkish court
understands English and no one really in

236
00:13:41,081 --> 00:13:42,370
English court understands Turkish.

237
00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:45,880
So they use Italian as
an intermediary language.

238
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:51,670
And obviously both these rulers are
tremendously proud and you know,

239
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:52,720
each one has a very,

240
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:55,930
as a very vivid sense of her own
importance or his own importance,

241
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:01,330
but they need to negotiate in the way
they communicate to one another in such a

242
00:14:01,331 --> 00:14:05,620
way as to, uh, you know,
not spark a conflict or,

243
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:08,290
or not fall out too much.

244
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:13,690
And so the person who's charged with this
is the translator person who's charged,

245
00:14:13,691 --> 00:14:17,020
not only with putting the meaning
across from one person to another,

246
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:22,560
but also sustaining a peaceful channel
of communication is the translator and

247
00:14:22,631 --> 00:14:25,410
the Turkish word for this kind
of translation struggle, man. Um,

248
00:14:25,411 --> 00:14:27,520
and there's a lovely bit in one of their,
um,

249
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:30,430
and one of their letters where
the sultan writes, you know,

250
00:14:30,431 --> 00:14:32,950
Elizabeth has written a letter to,
to south and the third,

251
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:34,630
and he writes back saying,

252
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:40,860
thank you Monique for demonstrating
your subservience and devotion to me.

253
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:47,200
Um, and I've, I've got, um, I've got
the, uh, my Turkish is not really good,

254
00:14:47,201 --> 00:14:50,320
but his are, it will be deactivate the
last than that. I can't speak Turkish,

255
00:14:50,321 --> 00:14:51,820
but those are the,
the um,

256
00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:53,930
the Turkish words and the
dragon looks at that and things.

257
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:57,800
And Elizabeth the first is not really
going to be very pleased to see that he

258
00:14:57,801 --> 00:15:00,630
thinks that she is subservient to him.
Uh,

259
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:03,830
so when he translates that
into Italian, he says, uh,

260
00:15:03,890 --> 00:15:07,510
he changes it to thank you
for showing censhare Amie Gto.

261
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:10,280
Thank you for showing sincere
friendship. Um, towards me.

262
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:12,890
And when she receives the letter a,
that's what she understands.

263
00:15:12,891 --> 00:15:15,980
And the same thing happens the other
way and you've got to think of how sweet

264
00:15:15,981 --> 00:15:20,840
and how, you know, how unusual.
But actually, um, this,

265
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:21,021
uh,

266
00:15:21,021 --> 00:15:25,610
so what we have here is an instance of
translation and diplomacy going together.

267
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:30,470
And the point I want to draw from this
is that translation is also always a

268
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:35,240
matter of doing something that's going
to be acceptable in the community that

269
00:15:35,241 --> 00:15:40,170
you're moving the text into. So
when you're wondering, okay, um,

270
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:42,740
here's the thing, this other language,
I'm writing it in this language,

271
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:46,640
I'm going to translate it into this
language, but I need it to be readable.

272
00:15:46,641 --> 00:15:51,620
I need people to accept it. Um,
I need people, yeah, I need,

273
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:52,513
I need it.

274
00:15:52,730 --> 00:15:57,260
I need to put it into language in a way
that is going to be acceptable in the

275
00:15:57,261 --> 00:15:59,150
community I'm putting
it into language for.

276
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:02,240
So the general point I want to
take from this, uh, Elizabeth,

277
00:16:02,241 --> 00:16:05,390
the first and salt and Morehead instances
that translation's always got an

278
00:16:05,391 --> 00:16:08,780
element of diplomacy in it
is not just about, again,

279
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:12,020
it's not just about moving from
one language to another language.

280
00:16:12,021 --> 00:16:13,840
It's about recognizing the,
uh,

281
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:18,290
language is a medium of
communication for a culture,

282
00:16:18,291 --> 00:16:22,280
for a community. And uh, thinking about
entering into that community as well.

283
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:28,800
My last instance, um, is from a
long time earlier. So it's from, um,

284
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,630
the very first years of what we
call the common area in China. Um,

285
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:39,020
and the situation here is the um,
uh,

286
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:44,030
Buddhist holy people,
but his monks who knew the Buddhist,

287
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:48,020
we're moving from India to China,
just walking.

288
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:49,850
Um,

289
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:54,410
and they knew that bit of suture
is by heart in a language,

290
00:16:54,411 --> 00:16:58,580
perhaps in Sanskrit,
perhaps in one of various other languages.

291
00:16:59,450 --> 00:17:02,300
And they are arriving in China where
people are speaking kind of varieties of

292
00:17:02,301 --> 00:17:07,301
Chinese and they want the holy
techs to be translated into Chinese.

293
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:11,880
And how did this happen?
Um,

294
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:17,320
the way this happened was that the holy
person he'd traveled from India would

295
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:19,820
knew the takes stop by home,
would recite it

296
00:17:21,350 --> 00:17:26,350
in front of a whole group of people in
front of the BN assembly of Chinese holy

297
00:17:27,291 --> 00:17:28,124
people.

298
00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:33,230
And they'd listen and they'd consider an
they'd agree together what they thought.

299
00:17:33,231 --> 00:17:36,240
The best translation of this,

300
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:42,040
these words in Sanskrit or other possible
languages would be made agree that,

301
00:17:42,681 --> 00:17:46,390
and then somebody else would do the thing
of, of writing it down into a format.

302
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,350
There's, this isn't actually a
tax from, it's a Chinese suture,

303
00:17:49,351 --> 00:17:52,170
but it's not actually a text
from, from um, all that time ago.

304
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:55,680
It's just kind of serving
as an, as an illustration of
this, um, this environment.

305
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,800
Um, so you look at that
and you think, okay,

306
00:17:58,801 --> 00:18:00,680
this is surprising because
translation here is,

307
00:18:00,681 --> 00:18:03,240
is being done by a group of people.

308
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:06,210
Whereas I tend to think of translation
being quite solitary activity like this

309
00:18:06,211 --> 00:18:09,540
that takes over there. And I want to
translate it into this language over here

310
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:14,610
and here. We've got a group of people
agreeing how to do the translation.

311
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:17,130
And actually though when you,
um,

312
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:22,580
this phenomenon of crowd translation
is much more widespread than it first

313
00:18:26,251 --> 00:18:27,720
appears.
Um,

314
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:31,410
so it's very obvious these days and crowd
translation services on the Internet.

315
00:18:31,411 --> 00:18:33,600
So there'll be a translation company
and you send your tech stack to be

316
00:18:33,601 --> 00:18:37,370
translated and two or three
people work on it or more. Um,

317
00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:39,180
it's there in the way
Google translate minds,

318
00:18:39,181 --> 00:18:42,650
lots of different tax in order to
find the translations that are um, up.

319
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:46,320
But actually they are all the way through
the history of translation as well.

320
00:18:46,321 --> 00:18:48,510
So if you think about
the King James Bible,

321
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:53,720
so this is the great translation of the
Bible into English that becomes the core

322
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:57,650
tax to the Anglican Church,
uh, back in 1611. Um,

323
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:02,400
and that was done by 47 translators,
um, all working together.

324
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:06,360
And the reason for that isn't just that
it was a great long tax and they just

325
00:19:06,361 --> 00:19:07,620
want it to do a bit each.

326
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:11,400
The reason for that is that they
needed to agree as a community.

327
00:19:11,401 --> 00:19:13,680
And this relates to the diplomacy
point from a moment ago.

328
00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:16,200
They needed to agree as a community,

329
00:19:16,201 --> 00:19:21,201
what together they thought the right
translation of this holy text should be.

330
00:19:22,650 --> 00:19:23,800
And you can see actually how,
you know,

331
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:27,090
especially with religious takes where
the whole point of a religious text is to

332
00:19:27,091 --> 00:19:31,350
be a tax that sort of is shared among
a community that a community can enter

333
00:19:31,351 --> 00:19:35,700
into and all agree about, um,
that this feeling of, okay,

334
00:19:35,701 --> 00:19:39,420
we're going to agree on the translation
together, um, is going to be important.

335
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:44,070
And actually another thing that King James
Bible did was draw on lots of earlier

336
00:19:44,071 --> 00:19:46,650
Bible translation. So, so much
a composite kind of taxed.

337
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:50,430
So that's another kind of
big and obvious example. But

338
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:54,570
actually if you think about
what any translator does.

339
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:57,400
So another example is Dryden, who's a, a,

340
00:19:57,401 --> 00:20:00,500
a great English poet and
translator from the late,

341
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:03,600
from the 17th century or
pope from the 18th century.

342
00:20:03,601 --> 00:20:07,230
These are people who are translating
from the classic striding is translating.

343
00:20:07,231 --> 00:20:10,770
Virgil poke is translating homer.
Um,

344
00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:15,200
but they weren't just working from
one lash text, the one Greek text.

345
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:18,560
So pope had quite good
Greek. It's, you know,

346
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:22,200
but he was also homer.

347
00:20:22,290 --> 00:20:27,290
He was reading homer in a Latin edition
that had Latin notes and commentary.

348
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:29,520
He was aware of a French translation,

349
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:33,390
whereas was wherever an Italian
translation, he was using dictionaries.

350
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:36,720
So his translation enterprise
in fact wasn't just,

351
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:38,550
there's one text in that language,

352
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:42,390
and I'm putting it into my language is
much more a matter of drawing from many

353
00:20:42,391 --> 00:20:46,020
different texts and drawing from many
different languages. And in fact,

354
00:20:46,021 --> 00:20:46,831
if you think about,
you know,

355
00:20:46,831 --> 00:20:49,690
even if somebody says something to me
in a language and I translate it into

356
00:20:49,691 --> 00:20:52,900
English, what am I using in
order to do that? You know,

357
00:20:52,930 --> 00:20:57,820
I'm using all the instances of people
speaking or the stuff I've read that my

358
00:20:57,821 --> 00:21:01,720
language, you know, my knowledge of
language has come from in the first place.

359
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:05,560
So the point I want to take from that
then is the really ought, well, yeah,

360
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:10,210
all translation is crowd translation or
translation is always drawing on many

361
00:21:10,211 --> 00:21:12,700
texts and negotiating between many texts,

362
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:17,650
not just taking one and turning it
into another one. So here my, Oh yeah.

363
00:21:17,651 --> 00:21:22,300
So these are actually, um, these are
the King James Bible translators.

364
00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:26,530
So all these people offering
up the Bible too, uh,

365
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:30,200
to King James. So that's the crowd of
those translations. So here are my,

366
00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:33,980
here are my points that I've met so far.
Okay.

367
00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:37,280
Now. Okay. So I'm just going to,

368
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,233
yeah,

369
00:21:40,370 --> 00:21:44,790
it was for a moment. What's next?
Okay, I'll put that up there.

370
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:51,173
Okay.

371
00:21:52,050 --> 00:21:55,270
So what I've hoped to do
with these instances, um,

372
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:57,960
is just flesh out a bit.

373
00:21:58,230 --> 00:22:03,230
The variety and the complexity of the
kinds of doing things with language that

374
00:22:05,431 --> 00:22:06,690
get called translation.

375
00:22:07,470 --> 00:22:09,750
There's always a question of
discipline of right and wrong.

376
00:22:09,751 --> 00:22:13,710
When translation is in the room,
you always need to think, okay,

377
00:22:13,711 --> 00:22:16,800
what particular purpose and
context is it being done for?

378
00:22:16,801 --> 00:22:19,200
It's not just a language,

379
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:24,210
it's got this diplomacy aspect because
it's about bringing a text into a

380
00:22:24,211 --> 00:22:29,211
community and it's got this
crowd translation aspect
because you always know the

381
00:22:30,631 --> 00:22:34,520
languages that you know from many sources.
So just want,

382
00:22:34,521 --> 00:22:36,420
I just wanted to kind of

383
00:22:38,010 --> 00:22:42,550
sort of add those perspectives.
Right.

384
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:47,600
Well, I want to do now is, okay,

385
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:49,350
just seeing how long I've been going for.

386
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:53,460
What I want to do now is think about the
relation between these kinds of ways of

387
00:22:53,461 --> 00:22:57,480
moving across languages that we call
translation and languages. You know,

388
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:02,520
because as soon as you got translation,
you have to have languages.

389
00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:05,700
Or at least that's the standard idea.
What does translation do?

390
00:23:05,701 --> 00:23:09,090
Translation takes meaning
from one language and puts
it into another language.

391
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:12,300
So in order for that to be possible,
they need to be separate languages.

392
00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:17,670
But how secure is this idea
that languages are separate? Um,

393
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:21,470
Derrida has an argument about
the word Bible. Um, and it's in

394
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:27,810
an essay called, uh, they taught about
bell, the towers or the turns of babble.

395
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:31,590
And he says, well, what language does
the Word Bible belonged to? You know,

396
00:23:31,591 --> 00:23:34,260
it's a word in French,
it's a word in English,

397
00:23:34,730 --> 00:23:38,070
it's the word in many other languages as
well. So if I write the word, you know,

398
00:23:38,071 --> 00:23:40,590
you see a piece of paper like that with
Word Bible in it. What language is it?

399
00:23:40,591 --> 00:23:41,820
And we don't know what languages.

400
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:46,250
And so if that word is shared between
languages that shows that the languages

401
00:23:46,251 --> 00:23:47,120
aren't completely separate,

402
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:51,530
I think that he could have made the
same point about many, many words.

403
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:56,150
So this is just a paragraph from my
little boat that you've got and obviously

404
00:23:56,151 --> 00:23:58,850
I'm writing it in English.
I was writing it and then I thought,

405
00:23:58,851 --> 00:24:02,960
now many of the words that I'm using
are almost identical to words in French.

406
00:24:03,630 --> 00:24:05,450
Um, and they, they are. So
I write the word identical.

407
00:24:05,451 --> 00:24:07,610
It's almost like the words you don't
tick or right. The word paragraph.

408
00:24:07,611 --> 00:24:10,340
It's just like the word park off.
I wrote the word pronunciation.

409
00:24:10,341 --> 00:24:11,780
It's almost like the word panels.
Yes.

410
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:16,340
So lots and lots of words in English.

411
00:24:16,341 --> 00:24:21,200
I'll almost identically shared with French
or Spanish or Italian and other sets

412
00:24:21,201 --> 00:24:23,690
of English words that are almost
identical. He shared with German.

413
00:24:24,050 --> 00:24:28,490
So there's lots of intermingling and
overlap between these languages that we

414
00:24:28,491 --> 00:24:33,380
think of as being separate languages.
And it's the same with grammatical forms,

415
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:36,440
you know, grammatical form
that goes subject verb, object.

416
00:24:36,441 --> 00:24:39,740
I like the cart Jim to show. It's the
same in across English and French.

417
00:24:39,741 --> 00:24:42,320
And other languages. And then as you move
into languages that are further away,

418
00:24:42,321 --> 00:24:47,300
it all gets, it gets more different.
So translation operates between,

419
00:24:47,910 --> 00:24:51,950
um, how language is related to one
another is a very varied thing.

420
00:24:52,550 --> 00:24:55,960
So you can have languages that are very
far apart like English and Japanese. So,

421
00:24:56,390 --> 00:24:58,280
and you can have Englishes
that are very close.

422
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:03,760
So what we're dealing with in fat is a
whole landscape of language variation and

423
00:25:04,221 --> 00:25:06,260
intermingling and overlap.

424
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:10,860
And what it is to translate from
a distant language, you know, to,

425
00:25:11,290 --> 00:25:15,860
to the language that is distant from is
quite a different challenge from what it

426
00:25:15,861 --> 00:25:20,861
is to translate between two very close
languages like English and French.

427
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:28,010
Um, now why though do we think
of English and French is being,

428
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:30,380
you know,
English is very varied.

429
00:25:30,530 --> 00:25:34,130
There are lots of different
dialectal forms of English, you know,

430
00:25:34,131 --> 00:25:36,710
groups of people speak English in
different ways or different technical

431
00:25:36,711 --> 00:25:39,920
languages. There's lots of variation
within the thing we call English.

432
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:44,000
So why do we think of English and
French as being different languages?

433
00:25:44,490 --> 00:25:46,840
And we think of English and French is
being different languages because they're

434
00:25:46,850 --> 00:25:50,800
attached to different
political states basically. Um,

435
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:55,250
so what, how, what has happened
over the course of history? Um,

436
00:25:56,150 --> 00:25:58,110
what really started happening,
uh,

437
00:25:58,130 --> 00:26:03,130
in the 17th and 18th centuries is that
France and England saying started to say,

438
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:10,040
um,
we need to standardize our language.

439
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:12,440
Okay. English is being used
in many different ways.

440
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:15,380
Words have being spelled
in many different ways,

441
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:19,520
but now printing enters into this as well.
So printing over the last 200 years,

442
00:26:19,521 --> 00:26:23,120
as soon as you've got printed books,
so famously Shakespeare,

443
00:26:23,121 --> 00:26:25,900
every time he wrote his name,
spelled it slightly differently. Um,

444
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:29,570
and when you're in a manuscript
culture, that's, that's fine.

445
00:26:29,571 --> 00:26:31,610
You can spell words differently.
It's all handwriting.

446
00:26:31,611 --> 00:26:32,710
There's a lot of variety there.

447
00:26:33,410 --> 00:26:36,380
But as soon as you move into
a culture of printed books,

448
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:40,430
the idea that spelling
variation is a problem in it,

449
00:26:40,450 --> 00:26:43,480
spending variation starts
to seem like a problem. Um,

450
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:48,000
and what happens then is that people
create dictionaries and people create

451
00:26:48,001 --> 00:26:51,510
grammar books saying this is the
correct way of spelling the word,

452
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:52,890
the correct way of spelling.

453
00:26:52,891 --> 00:26:56,490
The word pronunciation in English has
got a u in it and it's different from the

454
00:26:56,491 --> 00:26:59,170
way of spelling pronunciation and French
ones yesterday one which has got an o

455
00:26:59,171 --> 00:27:00,540
in it.
Um,

456
00:27:00,570 --> 00:27:05,430
so it's only as a result of that state
sponsored process of language regulation

457
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,890
that we think of English as
being a language over here.

458
00:27:08,130 --> 00:27:09,780
And French is being a language over there.

459
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:12,410
And American is quite an
interesting example of this.

460
00:27:12,411 --> 00:27:14,340
So there was a dictionary maker,
um,

461
00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:19,380
in the United States in the early 18th
century who wanted American English to be

462
00:27:19,381 --> 00:27:21,630
different from English,
English, Noah Webster.

463
00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:26,910
And so the early additions of Webster's
American dictionaries and systematically

464
00:27:26,911 --> 00:27:31,710
he chooses to spell words differently
from the standard English spelling in

465
00:27:31,711 --> 00:27:36,090
order to try to make American English
seem, uh, different from English, English.

466
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:41,030
So what we've got here is, um, a,

467
00:27:43,250 --> 00:27:46,920
a kind of enterprise of, um, language.

468
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:51,600
As soon as you've got a process
of language standardization,

469
00:27:51,810 --> 00:27:56,280
this is the correct way of using the
language that separates it from other

470
00:27:56,281 --> 00:27:57,114
languages.

471
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:02,400
And translation enters into that because
it's only when you've got a language

472
00:28:02,401 --> 00:28:07,401
that separate or a kind of way of using
language that feels different that you

473
00:28:08,311 --> 00:28:12,750
need to translate in order to
get into this language over here.

474
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:15,780
And you can see that the sensitivity
is around that. Say for instance,

475
00:28:15,781 --> 00:28:20,781
they'll be film set in north of England
where people are speaking English with

476
00:28:21,790 --> 00:28:25,500
uh, kind of, uh, you know, say a livable
acts and unembarrassed dialects are ways.

477
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:27,150
And then they get,
you know,

478
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:30,360
they show in America and they
have subtitles or sometimes
they show in the south

479
00:28:30,361 --> 00:28:33,840
of England they have
subtitles. And then that's, um,

480
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:36,930
people get upset about
that because it's saying,

481
00:28:36,990 --> 00:28:38,910
what do you mean this
isn't the same language?

482
00:28:39,210 --> 00:28:42,960
So as soon as you translate by
putting subtitles there, you say,

483
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:46,860
this is something you can't understand.
This is something different from us.

484
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:48,390
Um,

485
00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:52,980
another instance of this is from a
pilot in the 19th century called William

486
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:56,580
Bonds. We lived in Dorset
and he loved Dorset dialect.

487
00:28:56,730 --> 00:28:58,800
And so he wrote his
poems in Dorset dialect,

488
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:01,230
which was a bit different
from standard English,

489
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:04,980
but he wanted Dorset dialect
of figure as a language.

490
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:09,600
He didn't want it to seem like just
the kind of minor variety of English.

491
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:14,640
And part of what he did in order to assert
this was translate his Dorset dialect

492
00:29:14,641 --> 00:29:18,060
poems. I mean you can read the Dorset
dialect poems and understand them,

493
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:23,280
but he translated them into standard
English. And by doing that he said, look,

494
00:29:23,281 --> 00:29:24,150
Dorset dialect is,

495
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:29,180
or language and English is another
language so I can translate between them.

496
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:34,590
So we've got this peculiar
phenomenon that translation creates,

497
00:29:34,770 --> 00:29:39,120
enters into the creation of the separation
between languages, which then bridges.

498
00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:43,360
Um,
here's a really striking,

499
00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:45,130
very recent instance of this.

500
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:52,600
This is the Dayton accord from 1995,

501
00:29:52,601 --> 00:29:57,520
which was the international treaty,
the establish peace after the,

502
00:29:58,330 --> 00:30:00,700
um, the, the war in the former Yugoslavia.

503
00:30:01,690 --> 00:30:06,670
So this established Croatia,
Bosnia and Serbia,

504
00:30:06,671 --> 00:30:08,980
a separate national entities.

505
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,490
And because it was an
international treaty,

506
00:30:13,030 --> 00:30:16,660
it had to be written in different language
versions for the different states.

507
00:30:16,661 --> 00:30:19,560
Because the conventions of
international treaties is, you know,

508
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:22,090
if it's written in English and French
and English version and you have a French

509
00:30:22,091 --> 00:30:22,780
version.

510
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:27,780
So in order to create this treaty that
needed to be a Croatian version of

511
00:30:28,141 --> 00:30:30,040
Serbian version and a positive version,

512
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:34,900
well the trouble was these languages are
very close and overlapping and indeed

513
00:30:34,901 --> 00:30:39,220
they hadn't been through that process
of standardization and separation that I

514
00:30:39,221 --> 00:30:41,890
was just talking about in
relation to English. Um,

515
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:45,850
and here's one of the translators that
are talking about talking about what

516
00:30:45,851 --> 00:30:49,210
happened politically. She
says, look, this is a,

517
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:51,340
one of the translations
Vulcan called Louise ask you,

518
00:30:51,341 --> 00:30:53,800
I'm just gonna read it out cause it's
quite striking testimony I think.

519
00:30:54,550 --> 00:30:57,640
So she's working for the multinational
stabilization force and she says our

520
00:30:57,641 --> 00:30:59,650
language policy like that,

521
00:30:59,651 --> 00:31:03,430
all the international organizations in
Bosnia fed into the devise of ethnic

522
00:31:03,431 --> 00:31:08,110
politics in the country by providing
documentation and translations in three

523
00:31:08,410 --> 00:31:13,410
very similar but different language
versions linguistically to members of the

524
00:31:13,991 --> 00:31:17,350
various language services had a
hand in molding the three standards,

525
00:31:17,351 --> 00:31:20,110
which is to say what counted as
creation and what counted is Serbian.

526
00:31:20,111 --> 00:31:23,320
And what counted as positive because,
um,

527
00:31:23,321 --> 00:31:25,510
it wasn't decided already
in linguistic circles.

528
00:31:25,511 --> 00:31:27,730
What exactly constitutes the standard,

529
00:31:27,731 --> 00:31:31,650
especially especially the Bosnian
standard, the various orthography is,

530
00:31:31,651 --> 00:31:34,060
so that's books of spelling, dictionaries
and grammars who was an Indian.

531
00:31:34,061 --> 00:31:34,894
Always agree.

532
00:31:35,290 --> 00:31:38,710
So there was always much discussion in
this four edge Q language service on what

533
00:31:38,711 --> 00:31:43,570
could actually be included in a Bosnian
version as against the Croatian or

534
00:31:43,571 --> 00:31:46,990
Serbian. So here we've
got translators, you know,

535
00:31:47,170 --> 00:31:51,520
establishing the separation of languages
in order to be able to translate

536
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:52,413
between them.

537
00:31:52,450 --> 00:31:57,450
So this is translation as part of
an apparatus of language regulation,

538
00:31:58,780 --> 00:32:03,780
which creates separations between usually
national languages and standardizes

539
00:32:04,630 --> 00:32:08,890
languages within a nation state.
And then you get translation operating

540
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:09,953
between it.

541
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:16,740
The interesting thing though,
and this is um,

542
00:32:17,730 --> 00:32:22,370
where we moved back towards the literary
phenomena that um, I said, you know,

543
00:32:22,371 --> 00:32:23,820
interested me at the
beginning when I started,

544
00:32:26,130 --> 00:32:28,900
is it translation can also mix languages,
um,

545
00:32:29,130 --> 00:32:32,910
up and Google translate is quite good at
this actually. So the other day I got a,

546
00:32:33,630 --> 00:32:35,600
um,
a spam email in German and I said,

547
00:32:35,601 --> 00:32:37,950
I put this into Google translate
and it came out as in Germany alone,

548
00:32:37,951 --> 00:32:40,460
there are around 25 million science
helped to make the road and to make,

549
00:32:40,461 --> 00:32:44,450
say for all road users and say that's
not idiomatic standard English. That's,

550
00:32:44,451 --> 00:32:47,420
you can see the Germanic, the German
forms of Sumach and kind of coming,

551
00:32:47,421 --> 00:32:48,980
coming through in the way
the words are put together.

552
00:32:49,910 --> 00:32:52,700
Now people often kind of smile at this
sort of thing and they point to that and

553
00:32:52,701 --> 00:32:55,550
they say that shows that Google translate
isn't working as well as it should be.

554
00:32:56,090 --> 00:32:59,000
You know, they call that kind of language
translation needs. They say, okay,

555
00:32:59,001 --> 00:33:04,001
this is unsuccessful translation because
it hasn't achieved fluency in idiomatic

556
00:33:05,841 --> 00:33:07,310
standard English.

557
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:11,810
But the peculiar thing is those kinds of
literary creativity that I was talking

558
00:33:11,811 --> 00:33:14,240
about at the beginning,
the interested me right to the beginning,

559
00:33:14,510 --> 00:33:18,920
often do very much the same
thing. Um, and I'm just gonna um,

560
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:22,010
show you some couple of instances of this.
I'm getting towards the end.

561
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:27,560
Um, so this is, this is Dryden.
The payer I mentioned a moment ago.

562
00:33:27,561 --> 00:33:32,330
So He's through the 60 nineties
he's translating Virgil's Aeneid,

563
00:33:32,331 --> 00:33:34,130
that great,
great poem.

564
00:33:34,131 --> 00:33:38,190
And this is just the first line on
Marty widow and queer cannot throw a

565
00:33:38,191 --> 00:33:39,890
equipping them with [inaudible] and so on.

566
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:44,210
And the way he translates it arms and
the man icing who forced by fate left the

567
00:33:44,211 --> 00:33:48,140
Trojan shore. And you can see
how, how the words are lining up.

568
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:51,760
And actually the way he uses the word,
who there, you know, what do you mean?

569
00:33:52,010 --> 00:33:56,540
Who goes with man arms? And the
man who forced by fate, it's not,

570
00:33:56,541 --> 00:34:01,490
wasn't back then either a natural way of
arranging the English words and actual

571
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:05,150
of arranging the English words would be
icing of arms and the man who was forced

572
00:34:05,151 --> 00:34:05,984
by fade.

573
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:11,680
So what he's doing then is he's taking
the Latin way with language and bringing

574
00:34:12,801 --> 00:34:14,210
it into English.

575
00:34:15,070 --> 00:34:19,670
And this way of moving what reversing
words and moving them around is something

576
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:24,440
that is common to do in English,
poetry of that time.

577
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:27,350
But it's common to do an English
poetry at that time because many,

578
00:34:27,351 --> 00:34:30,590
many people writing it knew Latin very
well. And had Latin in their minds.

579
00:34:31,430 --> 00:34:36,430
And so you've got this strange phenomenon
that what he's doing in order to write

580
00:34:37,041 --> 00:34:41,150
a poem in English is borrowing
from lush and at word order and,

581
00:34:41,151 --> 00:34:44,840
and Latin at way with language.
So he's mixing the kind of thing that,

582
00:34:45,410 --> 00:34:48,870
exactly the same kind of thing that
we've got there. That in that context,

583
00:34:48,871 --> 00:34:50,750
do you think, oh, that's Google
translate or working properly.

584
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:54,770
But as soon as you're in a
literary context where it's
okay to mess around with

585
00:34:54,771 --> 00:34:57,650
language, I think actually,
you know, you know,

586
00:34:57,651 --> 00:35:01,070
the general point here is that that
relationship between what we think of as a

587
00:35:01,071 --> 00:35:05,630
mistake in ordinary language use and
what we think of as something interesting

588
00:35:05,690 --> 00:35:09,470
as soon as it's in a poem or in a
literary text is quite, you know,

589
00:35:09,471 --> 00:35:12,620
it's very close. Um,
here's another instance.

590
00:35:12,621 --> 00:35:17,621
This is from the early 20th
century and this is Ezra pound.

591
00:35:18,770 --> 00:35:19,370
Um,

592
00:35:19,370 --> 00:35:24,370
and he's interested in finding ways of
writing poetry that don't have regular

593
00:35:24,921 --> 00:35:26,900
rhythm and that don't rhyme.

594
00:35:27,830 --> 00:35:31,250
And one of the things that helped him
to do this was an encounter with ancient

595
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:34,790
Chinese poems.
And he didn't understand Chinese,

596
00:35:34,791 --> 00:35:38,250
but he was given the gift
of notebooks from, uh,

597
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:42,300
a Chinese scholar that looked like this.
So you get the Chinese characters,

598
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:46,620
you get English words underneath,
and you get a kind of commentary.

599
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,330
And he thought, okay, I can take,

600
00:35:48,331 --> 00:35:53,331
I can see here that there's a way of
doing things with words as different from

601
00:35:53,401 --> 00:35:55,410
the usual way of doing
things with words in English.

602
00:35:55,710 --> 00:35:59,090
And I'm going to try to
write poems like this. Um,

603
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:04,680
and here's the beginning of one
of them, uh, which begins blue.

604
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:09,840
Blue is the grass about the river and
the willows have overfilled the close

605
00:36:09,850 --> 00:36:10,683
garden.

606
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:16,140
And so what's unusual about this or what's
different about this for many poetry

607
00:36:16,141 --> 00:36:19,440
that had been written before is,
um,

608
00:36:20,310 --> 00:36:23,940
well not any poetry that, but what's
unusual about it is that it's not rhyming.

609
00:36:23,941 --> 00:36:25,110
It doesn't have a regular rhythm.

610
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:29,070
And instead you've got this sort
of sequence of word units, blue,

611
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:32,280
blue grass,
river willows,

612
00:36:32,310 --> 00:36:34,410
overfilled close garden.

613
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:39,800
And he's arranging his words like that
in imitation of what he understands of

614
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:44,490
the sequence of Chinese characters in
the Chinese poems that he's been looking

615
00:36:44,491 --> 00:36:47,490
at. You know, and there's also the
strangeness of saying the grass is blue.

616
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:52,530
You know, what's the boundary between
blue and green is the evening. Um,

617
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:54,840
and there's also the title,
you know, the beautiful toilet.

618
00:36:54,841 --> 00:36:59,250
I think that's meant to be
a slightly surprising title.
And what it means is, uh,

619
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:03,630
you know, getting, um, doing makeup and
things like that. It's not actually,

620
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:08,880
it's not actually a Lou. Um, just one
more instance of this very recent one.

621
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:13,590
Um, and then I stop. Oh No.
Then I'll kind of wrap up. Um,

622
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:14,931
this is from a writer.

623
00:37:14,931 --> 00:37:19,340
I don't know if any of you been
reading called WG Sebald who is, um,

624
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:23,940
a writer who's been hugely successful in
English culture over the last 10 or 15

625
00:37:23,941 --> 00:37:28,680
years. Um, he's somebody who lived
in East Anglia, um, he's German,

626
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:30,120
writes in German,

627
00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:35,160
but it's very beautifully translated
into English by a couple of translators.

628
00:37:35,161 --> 00:37:37,440
Michael Wholesale and bell.
He translated this one.

629
00:37:38,370 --> 00:37:43,350
Now the kinds of novels that he writes
are quite like memoir, autobiography. Um,

630
00:37:43,351 --> 00:37:46,110
so they're very located in a place,

631
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:51,680
but they are also a lot about feeling
out of place and a peculiarity about his

632
00:37:52,771 --> 00:37:54,180
work is that,
say he's writing in German,

633
00:37:54,181 --> 00:37:58,920
he was published in Germany and then he's,
you know which culture they do.

634
00:37:58,950 --> 00:38:02,700
These books belong in. So
then his translation, the
books are written in English,

635
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:05,520
published in Germany,
translated into English,

636
00:38:05,521 --> 00:38:09,770
published here and actually lots of
the reviews and celebration of WG.

637
00:38:09,830 --> 00:38:13,770
Well in English literary press you
wouldn't know that he wasn't writing in

638
00:38:13,771 --> 00:38:14,910
English. They just say, okay,

639
00:38:14,911 --> 00:38:17,340
this is an amazing literary
style that he has an English.

640
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:20,340
And the interesting thing
about this is that this style,

641
00:38:20,370 --> 00:38:23,430
again like the other instances we've
looked at came into being through

642
00:38:23,431 --> 00:38:24,061
translation.

643
00:38:24,061 --> 00:38:28,470
If you just look at this first sentence
and the second half of the 1960s I

644
00:38:28,471 --> 00:38:32,730
traveled repeatedly from England to
Belgium, partly for study purposes,

645
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:35,500
partly for other reasons which
were never entirely clear to me.

646
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:39,280
Staying sometimes for just one or two
days, sometimes for several weeks.

647
00:38:39,281 --> 00:38:43,570
So it's quite a sort of decorous
and formal and long sentence.

648
00:38:43,571 --> 00:38:45,310
And generally that's
the case with his style.

649
00:38:45,311 --> 00:38:50,311
But it's also just ever
so slightly different from
what you expect an idiomatic

650
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:53,830
standard English. I think if
you look at the phrase, um,

651
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:58,430
for study purposes and there's a German
phrase behind that as a studio in Spec,

652
00:38:59,590 --> 00:39:00,730
but in English you'd say,
I'm,

653
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:03,820
I traveled repeatedly from England
to Belgium to study, you know,

654
00:39:03,821 --> 00:39:06,720
and you apply for a visa for
study purposes. You know,

655
00:39:06,750 --> 00:39:10,150
it's slightly unusual to
say I traveled to England,

656
00:39:10,151 --> 00:39:14,580
to Belgium for study purposes. And so
what's happening here is that, you know,

657
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:16,960
again,
it's a very similar phenomenon to,

658
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:21,210
to make the road and to
make so for road users, um,

659
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:25,390
you've got a Germanic phrase
coming through into English,

660
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:30,780
but becoming part of a literary style and
what's cause you want a literary style

661
00:39:32,621 --> 00:39:36,910
to be slightly unusual. You won a
literary style to kind of be distinctive.

662
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:40,810
And so what's distinctive about this
literary style is that it's slightly at

663
00:39:40,811 --> 00:39:43,150
odds with standard English.

664
00:39:43,570 --> 00:39:46,930
And that becomes part of the
imaginative world of the books,

665
00:39:46,931 --> 00:39:51,040
which is so much about feeling
displaced from, um, from where you are.

666
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:54,780
Okay. Now the question, um,

667
00:39:55,180 --> 00:39:58,510
I want to end up with
really is the, um, okay. So,

668
00:39:58,540 --> 00:40:00,490
so here we've got two movements.

669
00:40:01,270 --> 00:40:06,270
We've got a movement of
translation operating between
one standard language like

670
00:40:06,761 --> 00:40:10,810
in the Croatian and Serbian creating
standard national languages,

671
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:17,340
wanting to translate from one standardized
language into another standardized

672
00:40:19,301 --> 00:40:23,680
language. And there's a desire to do
that correctly and achieve fluency.

673
00:40:25,210 --> 00:40:26,140
And on the other hand,

674
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:30,550
there's this creative use of translation
which changes the language. And in fact,

675
00:40:30,551 --> 00:40:35,320
translation always changes the language
that it's, um, that it's being done into.

676
00:40:37,030 --> 00:40:40,600
But usually when that becomes visible as
in the email version, people think, oh,

677
00:40:40,601 --> 00:40:43,150
that's a mistake or that's a
failure to achieve fluency.

678
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:45,970
But when you're in a more literary realm,

679
00:40:46,150 --> 00:40:50,890
that kind of strangeness is something
that People Are, can, you know,

680
00:40:50,891 --> 00:40:54,730
people can get interested
in. Um, and enjoy. Now,

681
00:40:54,731 --> 00:40:58,100
I just want to bring this into
context into, into contact with, um,

682
00:40:59,170 --> 00:41:01,810
the way the world of communication.
Um,

683
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:04,360
it's changing because of the Internet
and also because of machine translation

684
00:41:04,361 --> 00:41:05,770
programs like Google translate.

685
00:41:06,970 --> 00:41:09,970
So that I think a lot of the rhetoric
around Google translate and similar

686
00:41:09,971 --> 00:41:14,350
programs is the aim to achieve
fluency in a standard language.

687
00:41:14,770 --> 00:41:15,460
Um,

688
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:19,840
and one of the things that the internet
does is spreads dominant languages like

689
00:41:19,841 --> 00:41:21,250
English around the world.

690
00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:26,290
But another thing the internet does
is it makes visible lots of varied and

691
00:41:26,291 --> 00:41:30,190
dialectal and idiosyncratic,
a nonstandard uses of language.

692
00:41:30,670 --> 00:41:33,410
So in social media and,
and you know,

693
00:41:33,411 --> 00:41:37,540
also all sorts of kind of greets people
are coming out with language that's,

694
00:41:37,550 --> 00:41:40,280
you know,
distinctive just belongs to that group.

695
00:41:40,281 --> 00:41:43,760
It's misspelled according to the
standard expectations of spelling.

696
00:41:44,090 --> 00:41:45,720
It's dialectal.
Um,

697
00:41:45,721 --> 00:41:49,250
it's a mixture of English and French or
it's a mixture of different languages.

698
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:50,750
So I think there are two,

699
00:41:51,930 --> 00:41:56,390
two sort of movements in what the
Internet is making visible or is doing

700
00:41:56,420 --> 00:41:58,940
linguistically.
On the one hand,

701
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:03,430
there's the idea of a desire to achieve,
you know,

702
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:06,920
fluency and translation software.
But on the other hand,

703
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:11,030
there's the making visible of lots
of linguistic phenomena that kind of

704
00:42:11,031 --> 00:42:13,150
challenge that.
Um,

705
00:42:14,050 --> 00:42:18,530
and uh, yeah, so I think, um,

706
00:42:19,910 --> 00:42:23,600
so I think there's a, there's a,
there's a question then, um, about,

707
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:27,730
about which version of translation,
um,

708
00:42:27,860 --> 00:42:30,320
which what's sort of language use,

709
00:42:30,410 --> 00:42:33,030
I mean obviously that they're both
going to carry on being there,

710
00:42:33,590 --> 00:42:36,590
but how they relate to one
another and how they get handled,

711
00:42:37,220 --> 00:42:42,220
which is to say does the creative kind
of translation which relishes difference

712
00:42:43,101 --> 00:42:47,660
and strangeness and can be about me
manifesting my particularity as an

713
00:42:47,661 --> 00:42:51,890
individual and achieving a particular
kind of mode of understanding with you as

714
00:42:51,891 --> 00:42:52,724
an individual.

715
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:57,860
So that's about people playing with
language or people doing inventive things

716
00:42:57,861 --> 00:43:00,020
with language,
which is part of what we do with language.

717
00:43:00,770 --> 00:43:03,230
And on the other hand
as language regulation,

718
00:43:03,670 --> 00:43:07,250
this is the sort of need
for clear communication and
business contexts or legal

719
00:43:07,251 --> 00:43:09,680
contexts. Um, I, one of the
things I'm interested in,

720
00:43:09,681 --> 00:43:11,540
I have no idea how people
use Google translate,

721
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:16,730
but the sort of assumption that things
like that, that email our mistakes,

722
00:43:16,731 --> 00:43:21,731
we just need to move beyond and we need
to achieve in I clear communication

723
00:43:22,161 --> 00:43:25,580
between different standard languages
that it seems to me that's very much the

724
00:43:25,581 --> 00:43:28,820
rhetoric around her. But on the
other hand, I quite like, you know,

725
00:43:28,821 --> 00:43:32,060
that the Kuli or versions of language
that Google translate producers sometimes,

726
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:35,210
and I like the sort of, you
know, there is different, um,

727
00:43:35,211 --> 00:43:38,380
translation possibilities that it
opens up. So it seems to me this,

728
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:41,930
there was sort of different possibilities
for how translation is going to

729
00:43:42,110 --> 00:43:46,490
feature on the Internet, um, in, in
the future, a more regulated version.

730
00:43:46,550 --> 00:43:50,300
And as it were, a more inventive and
an archaic version. So I said, well,

731
00:43:50,301 --> 00:43:52,520
what the future is, is obviously
going to be a world of translation,

732
00:43:52,521 --> 00:43:55,880
but what kind of translation that is
going to be remains to be discovered.

733
00:43:55,881 --> 00:43:57,170
Thank you.
Thank you for your attention.

734
00:43:58,260 --> 00:44:03,260
[inaudible]

735
00:44:03,660 --> 00:44:05,610
thank you very much.
We do have time for questions.

736
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:07,473
Yup.

737
00:44:15,770 --> 00:44:19,340
Actually, I have a zillion
questions, but, um, I,

738
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:21,500
it seems to me that translation,
um,

739
00:44:21,670 --> 00:44:26,020
is really important to the evolution of
language because a part of culture that

740
00:44:26,110 --> 00:44:30,550
is, um, kind of carried
on to other nations,

741
00:44:30,551 --> 00:44:32,710
whether geographically or otherwise.
Yeah.

742
00:44:32,810 --> 00:44:36,840
And machine learning and Google
translate today is not capable of kind of

743
00:44:36,841 --> 00:44:41,290
grasping those nuances that
come with, um, you know,

744
00:44:41,610 --> 00:44:43,530
translation as we see it today.

745
00:44:43,531 --> 00:44:47,190
Kind of understanding what the purpose
of the other is saying and trying to

746
00:44:47,191 --> 00:44:52,191
translate it into not like semantically
the right kind of a flow with the words,

747
00:44:52,621 --> 00:44:57,050
but kind of like what you mean like the
in Boca Lupo versus punching hospices.

748
00:44:57,360 --> 00:45:02,040
But, so I was wondering your opinion,
what was your opinion on, um,

749
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:04,340
Esperanto and that regards?

750
00:45:04,980 --> 00:45:09,480
Okay. Um, uh, what I
think about is Pronto is,

751
00:45:09,481 --> 00:45:11,060
I don't know much,
I don't know much about us.

752
00:45:11,061 --> 00:45:13,410
Brand test is just kind of
off the top of my head. Um,

753
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:16,050
so what I imagined about Esperanto is the,

754
00:45:16,470 --> 00:45:21,320
I think the thing to ask about language
use is that it's, um, it's always, um,

755
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:26,970
there's a community doing
it. Um, so, um, the,

756
00:45:27,180 --> 00:45:29,250
you know,
how subtle a language is,

757
00:45:29,251 --> 00:45:32,980
how complex the communicative
interaction can be. Um,

758
00:45:33,060 --> 00:45:35,940
all arises from what the
community's like this using it,

759
00:45:35,941 --> 00:45:39,910
how long they've been using it and so
on. And I don't really, do you speak at,

760
00:45:39,911 --> 00:45:41,010
do do you use US brand tone?

761
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:45,920
Not at all. I'm just wondering if it's,
yeah. If a solution, yeah. Anything.

762
00:45:46,170 --> 00:45:49,730
No, I don't, I don't think those kinds
of things are, um, uh, solutions. I'll,

763
00:45:49,980 --> 00:45:54,300
I'll say why in a moment. But, um, my,
my imagining about his brand too is,

764
00:45:54,301 --> 00:45:57,090
so this is, uh, kind of
constructed language.

765
00:45:57,870 --> 00:46:01,020
How much of a history does
it have or who's using it?

766
00:46:01,021 --> 00:46:04,710
And so it's a language that you use
and then what's the consideration when

767
00:46:04,711 --> 00:46:06,060
you're using it?
Is the consideration,

768
00:46:06,061 --> 00:46:09,570
am I speaking Esperanto correctly
or is the consideration,

769
00:46:09,571 --> 00:46:12,030
can I play around with us?
Bronto and indeed, I mean,

770
00:46:12,210 --> 00:46:14,640
I don't know if you've
had these, you know, the,

771
00:46:14,650 --> 00:46:17,380
the common experience of sharing a lang,
you know,

772
00:46:17,490 --> 00:46:22,020
communicating with someone who speaks
another language and doesn't speak English

773
00:46:22,021 --> 00:46:24,180
very well and you don't speak the
other language very well. And in fact,

774
00:46:24,181 --> 00:46:28,470
what you do is you mix up the languages,
you sort of achieve a kind of local,

775
00:46:28,471 --> 00:46:33,330
private Esperanto. Really. Um,
and so I think the question for,

776
00:46:33,390 --> 00:46:34,223
um,

777
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:39,750
I think so Esperanto dates from in
the city before the Internet from,

778
00:46:39,780 --> 00:46:44,120
from, from a hundred years ago,
whenever it was. Um, and I,

779
00:46:44,540 --> 00:46:48,320
you know, it's just a question of
sort of what, what kind of usage, um,

780
00:46:48,390 --> 00:46:51,540
it enables really, but the
reason why I don't think, um,

781
00:46:51,630 --> 00:46:55,560
standardized international languages,
uh,

782
00:46:55,590 --> 00:47:00,090
our solution is the language
is really got to two purposes.

783
00:47:00,091 --> 00:47:03,150
One purpose of, of languages
to communicate with everybody.

784
00:47:03,690 --> 00:47:07,260
But another purpose of language is to
say I, me and this group, you know,

785
00:47:07,290 --> 00:47:09,990
speaking a language that's different
from that other language, you know,

786
00:47:09,991 --> 00:47:13,590
where my teenage kids, you know, use
words, I don't understand. If they don't,

787
00:47:14,250 --> 00:47:16,470
they don't do it because you know,

788
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:19,680
randomly they do it so that I
don't understand them, you know?

789
00:47:19,740 --> 00:47:22,080
So it's about manifesting your identity.
So there's a,

790
00:47:22,530 --> 00:47:25,710
so I think rather than saying
[inaudible] this. Okay.

791
00:47:25,711 --> 00:47:30,550
And then this is the issue about the
spread of English as a global language.

792
00:47:30,910 --> 00:47:33,310
On a technocratic spread of
English as a global language.

793
00:47:33,311 --> 00:47:34,540
What should we think about that?

794
00:47:35,410 --> 00:47:38,950
I think one thing to think
about that is that in, um,

795
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:45,040
defined technical or say business
contexts, you know, that's fine.

796
00:47:45,820 --> 00:47:49,360
I think I said, okay, but what
about English as, um, you know,

797
00:47:49,361 --> 00:47:52,720
just the medium that people are using to
communicate. I think I said, well, okay,

798
00:47:53,020 --> 00:47:55,120
but what's going to happen
there? And this is all, you know,

799
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:58,570
this is obvious in the different kinds
of Englishes that there are around the

800
00:47:58,571 --> 00:48:00,760
world. People are going to
be using English differently.

801
00:48:00,761 --> 00:48:02,800
They're going to be playing with it.
They're going to be mixing your top,

802
00:48:02,801 --> 00:48:06,100
they're going to be in. So
actually, and this is, I mean,
this is really one of the,

803
00:48:06,101 --> 00:48:10,000
this is the, I think, I think the
big question, which is to say that,

804
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:14,260
um, before the Internet, um,

805
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:19,570
so actually, um, what I've been
saying is quite Eurocentric.

806
00:48:19,570 --> 00:48:22,800
So what I have been saying is quite,
you're essentially so far, but so,

807
00:48:22,810 --> 00:48:26,470
so before the Internet, if you think
about how print culture worked,

808
00:48:26,680 --> 00:48:28,910
the market for printed books
was the night, you know, you'd,

809
00:48:28,911 --> 00:48:32,170
you'd publish a book and it would be
in England or in America or in France.

810
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:35,050
So you had these national cultures.

811
00:48:35,530 --> 00:48:38,530
It was all sorts of language variety in
the way people spoke from related to one

812
00:48:38,531 --> 00:48:41,020
another and the word dialect or
groupings and HB things and so on,

813
00:48:41,021 --> 00:48:42,400
said lots and lots of language for it.

814
00:48:42,970 --> 00:48:47,970
But I didn't become visible in print and
it couldn't be shared and therefore it

815
00:48:48,851 --> 00:48:50,410
couldn't be shared nationally.

816
00:48:50,411 --> 00:48:55,180
You'd go to a village in the country and
they would use language in a particular

817
00:48:55,181 --> 00:48:58,990
way, but that didn't spread, that
wasn't visible anywhere else.

818
00:48:59,380 --> 00:49:03,250
And so in order to be widely read,
you had to go into this,

819
00:49:03,251 --> 00:49:07,330
you had to produce a standardized
printed text in standard English.

820
00:49:07,690 --> 00:49:11,460
Well the Internet makes visible is lots
of all the variety of languages that

821
00:49:11,461 --> 00:49:13,270
previously wasn't visible.
It was just in,

822
00:49:13,271 --> 00:49:15,730
in spoken communities is
now visible on Internet.

823
00:49:16,150 --> 00:49:20,560
And I think how people negotiate that is
going to be really interesting to see.

824
00:49:21,070 --> 00:49:24,100
And I'm interested actually with machine
translation software that, you know,

825
00:49:24,460 --> 00:49:27,640
the degree to which the
ambition is continues to be,

826
00:49:28,420 --> 00:49:33,100
let's move from one standard language
to another standard language will the

827
00:49:33,101 --> 00:49:34,990
degree to which it can say,
you know,

828
00:49:34,991 --> 00:49:37,780
this is your way of using language
in that community of a few speakers.

829
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:41,440
Let's mediate between this way of
using language, how it can, you know,

830
00:49:41,441 --> 00:49:44,740
the degree to which you can kind of
register and cope with all the language

831
00:49:44,741 --> 00:49:46,480
variety though is becoming visible.

832
00:49:48,660 --> 00:49:49,493
Yeah.

833
00:49:59,190 --> 00:50:02,910
Press one.
Hello Em.

834
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:07,970
So Google translate is not aiming to
make it possible for everyone to use

835
00:50:07,971 --> 00:50:10,100
English. Yeah. The opposite. Yeah.

836
00:50:10,790 --> 00:50:14,900
But do you think it will be a full
similar to printing and dictionaries in

837
00:50:15,380 --> 00:50:17,420
helping to maintain a standard?

838
00:50:18,870 --> 00:50:23,430
I think, yeah. I think, um, yeah,
I think it could go either way.

839
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:28,520
I think it's, I think it's just, I
think that's about how people, I mean,

840
00:50:28,670 --> 00:50:29,850
I think it's partly about,
you know,

841
00:50:29,870 --> 00:50:34,040
obviously I feel upset and trying to say
to think about it in this room, but, um,

842
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:36,020
it's partly about how it's constructed,

843
00:50:36,021 --> 00:50:38,090
which I don't understand and
how it's going to, you know,

844
00:50:38,450 --> 00:50:42,800
the future of how it's going to be
constructed. Um, but it's also about how,

845
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:47,750
you know, how people use it. Um, and so,

846
00:50:47,930 --> 00:50:52,280
um, yeah, so I, you know, I can,

847
00:50:52,370 --> 00:50:55,700
I can imagine a developing
in a way that allows,

848
00:50:56,260 --> 00:51:01,130
you know that Sam's an idiosyncratic
nonstop, you know, that becomes inventive,

849
00:51:01,160 --> 00:51:03,740
that allows somebody to,
you know,

850
00:51:04,100 --> 00:51:09,100
put into it and inventive use of
language and English and for it then to

851
00:51:09,560 --> 00:51:11,090
generate various possible,

852
00:51:11,150 --> 00:51:15,740
different inventive equivalents
in different Italian,

853
00:51:15,741 --> 00:51:18,350
many different Italian
dialects. Say, you know,

854
00:51:18,351 --> 00:51:20,060
I don't see why I don't know
anything about technology,

855
00:51:20,061 --> 00:51:22,400
but I don't see why it shouldn't
develop in that direction.

856
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:27,380
So I think one can imagine
it developing in a way that,

857
00:51:27,770 --> 00:51:30,890
um, okay. So, so you think about,
okay, we need to communicate.

858
00:51:30,950 --> 00:51:33,030
And one way of community,

859
00:51:33,060 --> 00:51:35,540
one way of communicating is
being tolerant of diversity.

860
00:51:35,541 --> 00:51:39,980
One way of communicating is you saying
something and me being patient, uh,

861
00:51:40,310 --> 00:51:44,810
you know, uh, learning the words that
you're using, the, I don't know, you know,

862
00:51:44,811 --> 00:51:48,020
so we can have a room in which people
are all speaking quite differently,

863
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:52,310
but nevertheless they are accepting of
their difference and they've got patients

864
00:51:52,520 --> 00:51:55,580
to understand the particularities
of each other's languages.

865
00:51:56,600 --> 00:51:59,660
And the other thing is, okay, no, we
all need to speak standard English,

866
00:51:59,661 --> 00:52:03,650
so let's have a regulated environment
and that's take our individuality and

867
00:52:03,651 --> 00:52:07,820
discipline it according to the Shad
codafide standard that we're all using.

868
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:11,510
Um, so all language use is partly
a matter of recognizing difference.

869
00:52:11,930 --> 00:52:16,580
And it's all partly a matter of
establishing a common code. Um,

870
00:52:17,180 --> 00:52:20,300
and I think how, you know, I think how
Google translate develops is going to be,

871
00:52:20,470 --> 00:52:22,820
you know, I don't know
which way it will go. Um,

872
00:52:23,210 --> 00:52:25,520
but I really hope it goes on the more
diversity way, but you know, in the,

873
00:52:25,521 --> 00:52:30,521
in the lats rather than let's only
work between standard languages with a

874
00:52:33,171 --> 00:52:37,610
communicative purpose in order to achieve
something that counts as fluency and

875
00:52:37,611 --> 00:52:41,960
correctness. And rather than doing
that, if it develops in such a way,

876
00:52:41,961 --> 00:52:43,970
as I was saying a moment
ago, that it's, you know,

877
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:47,520
that you can use it playfully and user,
you know,

878
00:52:47,570 --> 00:52:50,330
enjoy the peculiarities of language,

879
00:52:50,331 --> 00:52:52,910
all kinds of different language difference
that it makes visible to you then

880
00:52:52,911 --> 00:52:53,744
that would be better I think.

881
00:52:56,870 --> 00:52:57,703
Yep.

882
00:52:58,230 --> 00:53:00,390
So I'm going to ask again
about the future of fashion.

883
00:53:00,420 --> 00:53:04,130
Could it be different and go
into their actions? So, um,

884
00:53:04,510 --> 00:53:08,430
automated versus the human part,
English versus Chinas.

885
00:53:08,700 --> 00:53:13,620
So the first question would be what
things do you think that cannot be

886
00:53:13,621 --> 00:53:15,120
automated?
100%.

887
00:53:15,130 --> 00:53:18,060
You think there's going to be like a
human translator on side that is going to

888
00:53:18,180 --> 00:53:20,220
steal their forever and the second side,

889
00:53:20,221 --> 00:53:24,150
if we agree that Chinese is going
to be the next big language,

890
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:28,040
which bridges you think that are
difficult? Uh, in this, in this side,

891
00:53:28,050 --> 00:53:29,550
we are in the Western world on the,

892
00:53:30,670 --> 00:53:33,700
yeah, the first one. I don't see why

893
00:53:36,420 --> 00:53:41,050
you said I'm very aware that, um,
whenever I do anything with language,

894
00:53:41,110 --> 00:53:46,110
I'm mediating between languages and
words that have come into my mind.

895
00:53:47,140 --> 00:53:50,980
You know, that's where I know my
language from. So I don't, you know,

896
00:53:50,981 --> 00:53:54,070
I think there's a lot of romanticism that
says only human beings can do this and

897
00:53:54,071 --> 00:53:56,830
machines will never be able to do this
because it seems to me that actually

898
00:53:58,330 --> 00:54:01,900
I don't see why a machine
in the future shouldn't

899
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:05,740
have the same,
you know,

900
00:54:05,741 --> 00:54:08,680
so that I think that at the moment what
a human being can do that a machine

901
00:54:08,681 --> 00:54:11,030
can't do is, you know,
handle, you know, uh,

902
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:14,690
bear in mind a lot of
complexity and nuance and it,

903
00:54:14,710 --> 00:54:16,660
that just seems to be a
matter of degree ready.

904
00:54:16,661 --> 00:54:18,160
So I don't see why in the future machine,

905
00:54:18,161 --> 00:54:20,290
I mean obviously I know nothing
about machines, but I don't see,

906
00:54:20,380 --> 00:54:23,290
I don't see in principle why in the
future machines shouldn't develop exactly

907
00:54:23,291 --> 00:54:27,520
the same kind of sensitivities as
it were that a human being does.

908
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:32,520
I think it's just romantic to to assume
that that's not going to be the case.

909
00:54:33,100 --> 00:54:34,600
Um,
so for instance,

910
00:54:35,740 --> 00:54:39,820
my enjoyment of those odd literary uses
of language that I was talking about a

911
00:54:39,821 --> 00:54:42,880
moment ago that comes from my same work.
Okay.

912
00:54:42,881 --> 00:54:44,500
The normal way of using English as this.

913
00:54:45,580 --> 00:54:48,400
And there were various
unusual ways of using English,

914
00:54:49,240 --> 00:54:51,310
this unusual way of using
English as a mistake.

915
00:54:51,850 --> 00:54:54,670
And this other unusual way of using
English is actually quite interesting and

916
00:54:54,671 --> 00:54:57,190
creative.
And why do I think that?

917
00:54:57,700 --> 00:55:01,570
I don't think that because of some sort
of special spiritual humanity that I

918
00:55:01,571 --> 00:55:02,730
have,
I think that because of,

919
00:55:03,340 --> 00:55:06,700
I spend my whole time kind of weighing
different kinds of language use and being

920
00:55:06,701 --> 00:55:09,340
aware of how words he is differently
in different contexts for different

921
00:55:09,341 --> 00:55:12,330
purposes. So I don't see why
a machine shouldn't, you know,

922
00:55:12,340 --> 00:55:16,930
develop that same kind of way of
handling language. But I mean,

923
00:55:16,931 --> 00:55:20,550
obviously I'm, I don't know the
thing about how machines work. Um,

924
00:55:20,680 --> 00:55:22,060
the thing about Chinese,
um,

925
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:27,320
I don't know Chinese and so I don't
really know what the issues are there, um,

926
00:55:27,370 --> 00:55:32,320
particular what the particular
issues are there. Um, I think, uh,

927
00:55:34,840 --> 00:55:38,680
yeah, so I don't, I can't
really sensibly answer that. Um,

928
00:55:39,310 --> 00:55:43,870
I think one thing I think though is
the, um, the issue about, about script,

929
00:55:43,871 --> 00:55:47,240
about forms of writing and
forms of speech, um, is,

930
00:55:47,300 --> 00:55:52,300
is really interesting and that phenomenon
that there is in Chinese and related

931
00:55:53,291 --> 00:55:56,800
languages like Japanese and Korean, that
they share lots of written characters.

932
00:55:56,830 --> 00:56:00,250
I mean, um, I, I can't say how,

933
00:56:00,490 --> 00:56:05,050
how similar and how different that is to
an English person being able to look at

934
00:56:05,051 --> 00:56:07,780
a French text and being able to guess
many of the words because they're written

935
00:56:07,781 --> 00:56:11,110
similarly. Um, but I think
that's an an, you know, that's
an interesting phenomenon,

936
00:56:11,111 --> 00:56:13,720
but I can't, I can't talk seriously about
Chinese. I don't know anything about it.

937
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:18,480
Thank you for coming. Thank
you, Matthew Reynolds. Okay.

938
00:56:18,910 --> 00:56:22,830
[inaudible].
