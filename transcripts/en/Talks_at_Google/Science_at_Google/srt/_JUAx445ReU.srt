1
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:07,930
I'm pleased to introduce Dr. Jeffrey West.

2
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:11,410
He's very likely,
um,

3
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:15,910
had the origin of our 20% time. It's a
funny story. Um, we have there over lunch.

4
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:19,390
I invite you to ask him about it sometime.
He's a theoretical physicist.

5
00:00:19,391 --> 00:00:22,270
He's primary interest, have been in
fundamental questions of physics,

6
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:25,330
especially those concerning
the elementary particles,

7
00:00:25,331 --> 00:00:30,190
their interactions and
cosmological implications. Um,

8
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:34,090
as long term fascination in general
scaling phenomena involved into a highly

9
00:00:34,091 --> 00:00:37,270
productive collaboration on the origin
of universal scaling laws that pervade

10
00:00:37,271 --> 00:00:40,950
biology from the molecular
genomic scale up through my,

11
00:00:40,951 --> 00:00:44,410
the country on cells to whole
organisms and ecosystems.

12
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:48,430
And many of these ideas I think form
the basis of his book that he's here to

13
00:00:48,431 --> 00:00:49,420
talk about today.

14
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:54,630
Scale the search for simplicity and unity
in the complexity of life from cells

15
00:00:55,661 --> 00:01:00,130
to cities, companies to ecosystems,
milliseconds to millennia.

16
00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:02,680
Please join me in giving
him a warm welcome today.

17
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:09,893
Thanks sir.

18
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:15,570
Whoops. White. So I'm going
to give a, you know, a, um,

19
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:18,570
uh,
roads of this short presentation,

20
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:23,260
short meaning I hope I can give
it about 30 minutes. Uh, uh,

21
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:27,910
giving an overview of what this book is
about and it covers a huge territory.

22
00:01:27,911 --> 00:01:32,310
It's so, it's very impressionistic.
It'll be a nontechnical.

23
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:35,190
The book is not technical.
The presentation will be not technical,

24
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:40,260
but it deals with a lot of deeply
technical and challenging problems.

25
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:45,450
And, um, it's, uh, it's
encapsulated in the title,

26
00:01:45,451 --> 00:01:46,170
which is here.

27
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:51,150
But there was this cute thing that penguin
press who produced the book produced.

28
00:01:51,151 --> 00:01:56,070
I can't help showing it to begin.
Uh, this, uh, we just kind of fun.

29
00:01:58,170 --> 00:01:59,003
There you go.

30
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:05,330
So I'm a physicist. Um, as
the set of new introduction,

31
00:02:05,331 --> 00:02:09,390
I said most of my career doing high energy
physics quarks and gluons and string

32
00:02:09,391 --> 00:02:14,060
theory of dark matter and
so on and so forth. And, um,

33
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,090
uh,

34
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:19,470
in a way what this book is about and what
this talk is about is sort of taking,

35
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:20,400
uh,

36
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:25,020
that way of thinking and asking how far
can you push it in terms of thinking

37
00:02:25,021 --> 00:02:28,360
about, um, a biology organism,

38
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:32,510
mid life and a socioeconomic
lines. And, uh,

39
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:37,320
so a lot of what I'm going to talk
about is going to be, uh, about,

40
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:39,330
uh,
cities and companies.

41
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,250
And I'm also going to talk a bit
a little bit about biology. Um,

42
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:48,070
but, uh, the framework
really is the whole, is,

43
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:53,130
is trying to ask to what extent can
you make a quantitative predictive

44
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:58,190
mathematize them computable
science of biological phenomena,

45
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:01,450
biomedical phenomena.
And, uh, in some ways,

46
00:03:01,451 --> 00:03:05,580
more importantly for what I want to
talk about socioeconomic phenomena. Um,

47
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:10,620
and really the passion behind all this
was the fundamental question as to

48
00:03:11,351 --> 00:03:16,120
whether this extraordinary enterprise
that we've developed over the last, well,

49
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:17,410
most 10,000 years,

50
00:03:17,411 --> 00:03:20,290
maybe you don't need really the last
couple of hundred years is actually

51
00:03:20,291 --> 00:03:23,980
sustainable in principle. So that's
what I'm going to try to lead up to.

52
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:28,760
And, uh, as I said, I
am, it's inspired by, uh,

53
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:31,840
work that I've done in
physics and in biology.

54
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:36,020
So the first thing is that I've already
knows that we live in a, uh, um,

55
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:39,090
an exponentially, whoops, is this a India?

56
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:44,660
Someone helped me if I press
that. Oh, picture bridge.

57
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:50,780
Actually, I talk about
bridges in the book. I run

58
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:54,320
the design of bridges.

59
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:03,660
Oh, very good. So we already
knows we live in a, in a, uh,

60
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:05,310
exponentially expanding universe.

61
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:09,480
But what is often not appreciated is
that of course we live in a exponentially

62
00:04:09,481 --> 00:04:12,140
expanding socioeconomic
universe. And it's, you know,

63
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:16,080
some figures that this that
you're probably familiar
with in one form or another,

64
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:18,180
but, um, you know,

65
00:04:18,181 --> 00:04:22,080
200 years ago when this
country was founded, almost,

66
00:04:22,081 --> 00:04:25,110
there was a must entirely
agricultural and rural,

67
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:29,080
and it's now become
overwhelmingly urbanized a,

68
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:33,480
it's about 82% of the US
population lives in cities.

69
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:36,290
And just a couple of years ago,
uh,

70
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:41,460
the world cross this amazing point of
being over half a of an eyes and it's

71
00:04:41,491 --> 00:04:44,820
moving towards that 70 to 80%,
uh,

72
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:49,860
mark in the next 50 years.
So this is extraordinary,

73
00:04:49,861 --> 00:04:54,861
but it's sort of interesting to put it
into sort of more a capturable terms.

74
00:04:55,261 --> 00:04:59,970
Whoops. And that is if you just
average, so the next 30 to 40 years,

75
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:04,440
that is equivalent to adding about almost
one and a half million people a week

76
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,930
to cities building that infrastructure.

77
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:12,260
That means building a New
York metropolitan area
every couple of months or a

78
00:05:12,901 --> 00:05:16,740
Seattle, the city of Seattle every
few days. That's what's going.

79
00:05:16,741 --> 00:05:17,970
It's sort of extraordinary.

80
00:05:17,971 --> 00:05:22,950
So this is everything that we do
is sort of with that backdrop,

81
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:27,720
this phenomenon that is taking
place. And um, you know,

82
00:05:27,721 --> 00:05:30,450
it's again represented by this.
This is China.

83
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:35,250
China was very slow to urbanize the,
the yellow there is the rural,

84
00:05:35,251 --> 00:05:40,251
the red is the urban and it's cross the
halfway mark and it is heading towards

85
00:05:40,561 --> 00:05:42,990
this 80% mark very rapidly.

86
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:47,790
And that is represented by its claim to
be building two to 300 new cities in the

87
00:05:47,791 --> 00:05:51,000
next 15 to 20 years,
each and excess of a million people.

88
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:55,170
So the stress and strain
on energy resources, uh,

89
00:05:55,171 --> 00:06:00,090
and in particular on the social fabric are
phenomenal. And this is just China. Uh,

90
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:04,730
we have India, we have Latin America, and
of course we have Africa. And of course,

91
00:06:04,731 --> 00:06:09,731
all of this is a reflection
of this incredible,

92
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:15,830
super exponential growth. The
population. I, um, you know, that's,

93
00:06:15,831 --> 00:06:16,664
this is,

94
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:21,700
this begins when we started to urbanize
when we stopped being hunter gatherers

95
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:25,130
and, uh, you know, it's,
it's sort of extraordinary.

96
00:06:25,131 --> 00:06:28,790
I look at this graph and I'm
looking up there. Um, uh,

97
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:33,140
I was born in 1940 where there were just
over 2 billion people on the planet.

98
00:06:33,141 --> 00:06:37,660
There's now seven and a half million,
and by the time many of you are dead, uh,

99
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:40,970
it will be 10 to 12 million.
So that's unbelievable.

100
00:06:40,971 --> 00:06:45,890
And so somehow we've got to sort of think
of this in much bigger terms then what

101
00:06:45,891 --> 00:06:50,510
its effect is even just on global warming
or in the environment or on a health

102
00:06:50,511 --> 00:06:52,150
and energy.
And so we're going to,

103
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:54,530
we need to sort of develop
a much bigger picture.

104
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:59,300
And all of this is manifested again
in this idea of open ended growth,

105
00:06:59,301 --> 00:07:02,660
which has been so extraordinarily
successful and, and
bringing us to this point.

106
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:05,660
And just to give another marker,
another metric of it,

107
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:10,130
this is the growth in the US GDP.
Um,

108
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:15,050
since roughly the civil war,
if you didn't invested $1 in the,

109
00:07:15,051 --> 00:07:18,410
in the,
in the stock market in about 1870,

110
00:07:18,411 --> 00:07:22,310
it would now be worth $1 million
even allowing for inflation.

111
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:26,570
So this is just a metric of the
extraordinary expansion of the economy.

112
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:30,560
Now all of this is bound up
with the development of cities,

113
00:07:30,561 --> 00:07:33,080
the urbanization that
I talked about briefly.

114
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:37,580
So one can immediately identify
that the fate of the planet,

115
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:42,440
you tell me what to press,
it's marvelous that this is happening.

116
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:47,150
I love it. This is the problem. I
do the stories. I could telegraph

117
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:51,440
my,

118
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:56,440
the way I gave a talk at the Google and
then mountain view about five years.

119
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,530
And uh, you know, I'm very old fashion.

120
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:07,550
I've got three times as old as most
seizures cause I can tell. But, uh, I,

121
00:08:07,551 --> 00:08:11,490
uh, I said a young coming and then
two days before four, I said, um,

122
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:15,840
uh, they said, send us the,
uh, you know, the PowerPoint.

123
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:20,570
Say PowerPoint. Just be kidding. I
said, I haven't been to transparencies.

124
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:25,660
I know I'm going to go back.
And they said, what's that?

125
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:29,290
I explained and you know,

126
00:08:29,291 --> 00:08:34,291
they had to go out and Google had to go
up and buy the overhead projector so I

127
00:08:34,301 --> 00:08:37,930
can give my tour, which was,
oh, we, I can just talk.

128
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:41,410
Maybe I'll just have to talk.
If you don't mind.

129
00:08:41,411 --> 00:08:46,230
I'll use my PowerPoint
as notes to just talk.

130
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:50,700
You were Miss Graphs and yours is going
to have to use your vivid imaginations.

131
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:56,010
So, let's see. So I'd love
to be pictures of cities.

132
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:57,513
So,

133
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:03,780
so the point is that the future of the
planet is now really the future of the

134
00:09:03,781 --> 00:09:06,020
cities of the future decisions
in the future of the planet.

135
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:11,030
The fate of the planet is completely
intertwined when what's happening in

136
00:09:12,811 --> 00:09:14,610
cities.
And uh,

137
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:19,670
so there is an urgent need to develop
a deep understanding of cities,

138
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:24,210
not just a qualitative
narrative version of cities,

139
00:09:24,211 --> 00:09:28,320
which is been the traditional way
of thinking about cities, but fire,

140
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:31,410
urban geography, urban
planning, urban economics,

141
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:35,700
but some of the more
scientific viewpoint and ask,

142
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:38,250
is it even possible?
Is it possible to have that?

143
00:09:38,251 --> 00:09:42,960
Is it possible to develop a science
of cities that could lead to an

144
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:47,040
understanding, their
structure, their dynamics,

145
00:09:47,041 --> 00:09:51,930
that growth and evolution so that we
can understand likewise the growth.

146
00:09:51,931 --> 00:09:56,580
That's the socioeconomic I economic life
that we've developed and lead into what

147
00:09:56,581 --> 00:09:58,240
I've tried to term a sort of,

148
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:01,800
so to speak of grand unified
theory of sustainability.

149
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:07,560
So, um, that's been been, uh,

150
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:12,480
that's been my passion for the
last several years. And, um,

151
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:16,530
uh, you know, we all understand why
cities are very attractive. You know,

152
00:10:16,531 --> 00:10:20,460
it's a place where there's greater
opportunities, there's great a buzz,

153
00:10:20,461 --> 00:10:22,970
there's more cultural events.
Um,

154
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:26,760
there's greater access to
good restaurants and so forth.

155
00:10:26,761 --> 00:10:30,510
And this has been the great attractor.
Is it an account?

156
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:34,230
And I've marvelous pictures.

157
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:41,060
Um, but you know, all of this, all of the
marvelous things. And look, you, I mean,

158
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:45,450
my God, you live in one of the most
energetic cities on the planet. I mean,

159
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:47,210
[inaudible] my God,

160
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:52,020
I was looking at all the construction
downtown. It's, it's phenomenal.

161
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:57,030
Um, and um, uh, but all
of that requires energy.

162
00:10:57,090 --> 00:11:01,740
So fundamentally at some fundamental
level, obviously energy has to come in.

163
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:07,010
And I'm sure most of you are familiar
with the second or third dynamics,

164
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:10,030
um, which says roughly speaking, that a,

165
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:14,800
if you try to create lots of
border, then you pay, oh, sorry.

166
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:21,270
Okay. So one second. Let
me see where I can. Okay.

167
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:25,740
So that's what I was saying.
I didn't, uh, and similar,

168
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:30,950
and this is just the images of the
images of why cities are exciting and

169
00:11:31,111 --> 00:11:35,810
important, but all of that requires
energy. And as I said, you know,

170
00:11:35,811 --> 00:11:37,870
from the second law of thermodynamics,
which afterwards,

171
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:42,440
the most fundamental law or physics,
it's the one thing that is immutable, uh,

172
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:47,010
creating order necessarily produces
disorder, producers, entropy.

173
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:51,630
And uh, so in creating cities
and creating socioeconomic order,

174
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:56,350
we of course, crepes, economic
entropy, which means that we have,

175
00:11:56,351 --> 00:12:00,610
we create things like
this and this and this,

176
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:05,620
this and this. And of course it,
this social unrest and so on.

177
00:12:05,621 --> 00:12:09,130
All of these are created
by this extraordinary
phenomenon and much of what's

178
00:12:09,131 --> 00:12:14,110
going on in the world in terms of, uh,
this kind of unrest in even if it's,

179
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:19,280
it's put in cultural and political and
ethnic terms is almost certainly a large

180
00:12:21,191 --> 00:12:24,400
part of that is just due to this
extraordinary phenomenon that's going on.

181
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:27,440
And one of the questions to ask is this,
is,

182
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:30,160
is this what cities are
going to end up looking like?

183
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:33,940
Is it all going to end up being
sort of slums and so forth,

184
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:38,260
which is happening in many parts
of the world or even this. Uh,

185
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:42,340
and so that's what I want to
sort of lead up to. So you know,

186
00:12:42,341 --> 00:12:46,570
when we think of cities, and I just
been talking about Seattle moment ago,

187
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:47,151
you sort of,

188
00:12:47,151 --> 00:12:51,520
the image is one of the physicality of
the city that is the infrastructure,

189
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:55,690
the roads, the, the
buildings and so forth.

190
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:56,860
When you think of Paris,

191
00:12:56,861 --> 00:12:59,860
you think of the Eiffel Tower
and the boulevards and so forth.

192
00:12:59,861 --> 00:13:01,380
I think New York skyscrapers,

193
00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:05,710
but in fact most important part of
the city is of course the people.

194
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:09,040
Because the whole point of the city is
people and the whole point of the city,

195
00:13:09,210 --> 00:13:11,890
it's the fist facilitate
interactions like this.

196
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:15,040
So this is really what you
should think of as a city.

197
00:13:15,041 --> 00:13:19,000
That there's the backdrop,
the physicality,

198
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:22,360
the roads, and the uh, transport systems.

199
00:13:22,361 --> 00:13:26,740
And the buildings are really the stage
upon which interaction takes place.

200
00:13:26,741 --> 00:13:31,000
And there's a marvelous picture of Rome
where you see that the backdrop has been

201
00:13:31,001 --> 00:13:33,160
there for 2000 years.
People have changed,

202
00:13:33,161 --> 00:13:36,070
but there's still a place
to provide interaction.

203
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:39,760
And there's a marvelous picture of
New York hundred 20 years ago or so.

204
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:44,110
And you can viscerally feel, um,
you know, the entrepreneurship,

205
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:48,040
the idea creation and so forth
that's taking place there.

206
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:52,060
And a, this is what city is a foreign.
Again, those buildings are still there.

207
00:13:52,061 --> 00:13:54,130
The people are no longer there.
There's different people.

208
00:13:54,131 --> 00:13:56,320
They're not on the streets,
they're in buildings.

209
00:13:56,620 --> 00:14:00,520
But those buildings and that stage
is to facilitate interaction,

210
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:05,290
to create wealth, to create ideas, to
innovate and so on. Places like this.

211
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:06,640
That's what sentence of four.

212
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:11,950
So I'm one of the dynamics,
uh,

213
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:16,980
any socioeconomic system when in fact
of any complex system is the tension

214
00:14:17,021 --> 00:14:20,740
between the physicality,
this physicality,

215
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:25,470
the energy and the resources,
the buildings in this case. Um,

216
00:14:25,810 --> 00:14:29,770
uh, but the flow of energy,
the metabolism of the system,

217
00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:32,020
um, uh, the,

218
00:14:32,021 --> 00:14:36,880
the tension between that
and the information exchange
that goes on between parts.

219
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:37,783
Yup.

220
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:48,080
Can I wait till the end? And I bring
that up again because that's very, uh,

221
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:52,880
that's a, um, a very challenging,
has been a question for,

222
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:56,630
you know, what is the city
and we'll come back to that,

223
00:14:56,631 --> 00:15:00,620
but I need to go through stuff and then
I will give you a definition of a city,

224
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:05,960
an operational definition.
So there's this tension between,

225
00:15:05,961 --> 00:15:10,130
so to speak, the feminine dynamics
of the Information Exchange, uh,

226
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:13,300
that those pictures we
show. So that show that, um,

227
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:18,470
and also the recognition that, uh,
almost all the problems that we face,

228
00:15:18,471 --> 00:15:22,140
whether it is global warming or
it's the question of, uh, you know,

229
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:26,720
do we have enough energy and enough
resources, questions of trying collusion,

230
00:15:26,721 --> 00:15:31,670
health and so on. All these are generated
in an urban environment primarily.

231
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,020
And so,
uh,

232
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:37,380
organization can be thought of as the
source of the tsunami of problems that we

233
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,690
face across the planet,

234
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:42,500
but they're also the solution because
of the very reasons I said earlier.

235
00:15:42,501 --> 00:15:44,220
They are magnets,
uh,

236
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:49,270
that's or vacuum cleaners that
suck up the smart people or the,

237
00:15:49,341 --> 00:15:50,240
uh,
you know,

238
00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:55,280
almost all the great ideas and what's
all the wealth that's created is created

239
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:57,470
in some kind of urban environment.

240
00:15:57,860 --> 00:16:02,210
And associated with that is that
all of these various things,

241
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:03,440
this is just an,
uh,

242
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:08,720
an incomplete laundry list of many things
that are part of associate economic

243
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:14,080
system. Uh, let's see. She like, yeah,

244
00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:18,800
I'm going to press that,
that no,

245
00:16:24,270 --> 00:16:27,220
I'm not just good at flipping
transparency as a parent.

246
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:35,240
Okay. So an important aspect, you know,

247
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:40,130
typically we treat each one of these
roughly speaking autonomously or semi

248
00:16:40,131 --> 00:16:42,410
autonomously. That is a, you know,

249
00:16:42,411 --> 00:16:45,980
like we think only of global warming
and we only think of energy or the only

250
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,230
thing,
health issues and so on.

251
00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:51,410
But all of these are themselves
highly complex systems.

252
00:16:51,411 --> 00:16:55,460
They're each adapting and evolving and
they're all most importantly interacting

253
00:16:55,461 --> 00:16:58,030
with each other. And so, um,

254
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:03,250
if you only treat one and only think of
one and stave stayed quite stove pipe,

255
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:05,130
you have the,

256
00:17:05,210 --> 00:17:10,210
the classic problem of all kinds of
unintended consequences because of the

257
00:17:10,850 --> 00:17:13,070
neglected interactions
with everything else.

258
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:17,090
So it's very important to develop a,
an integrated,

259
00:17:17,091 --> 00:17:22,010
bigger picture in order to see all these
things as part of an integrated whole.

260
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:26,090
So now I'm going to switch gears and
I'm going to talk a little bit about

261
00:17:26,091 --> 00:17:31,091
biology as a way to leading back into
some of these questions of cities and

262
00:17:32,121 --> 00:17:36,950
ultimately that of companies
and then sustainability.

263
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:40,160
So, um, uh, first of all,

264
00:17:40,161 --> 00:17:42,980
if you're going to have a
science of one of these systems,

265
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:45,110
kind of physics of a city,

266
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:49,530
there's no way that there's a Newton's
laws of cities that meaning that a bunch

267
00:17:49,531 --> 00:17:54,060
of principles from which you can
calculate anything so that, uh,

268
00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:55,163
uh,
you know,

269
00:17:56,490 --> 00:17:59,340
physics is best represented
by the fact that we can,

270
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:04,610
we know the position of a satellite to
almost any degree of accuracy so that we

271
00:18:04,861 --> 00:18:06,060
can use our cell phones.

272
00:18:06,061 --> 00:18:09,720
And bounce things off and the
whole it enterprise could work.

273
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:14,100
But that works because we can do
that to any degree of accuracy.

274
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:19,340
But the idea that you could do that in a
complex adaptive systems lot such as an

275
00:18:20,461 --> 00:18:25,461
organism or a city as
clearly extremely unlikely.

276
00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:27,330
Nevertheless,

277
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:31,680
you could have a theory that is
what I will call core screen.

278
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:35,370
That is you can get the generic properties
of the system will understand those.

279
00:18:35,370 --> 00:18:40,320
So there's kind of an in between of
not being able to address any of the

280
00:18:40,321 --> 00:18:45,290
questions to having something
predictable to any degree of accuracy.

281
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:49,500
Maybe we can predict some
coarse grained low resolution,

282
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:54,690
uh, characteristics of these
systems. So his, um, an example,

283
00:18:55,230 --> 00:18:59,520
first question, why do we live a hundred
years and not a thousand? So we're,

284
00:18:59,521 --> 00:19:02,340
why is it that I can say
with absolute certainty,

285
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:06,420
everybody in this room will be
dead in a hundred years? Um,

286
00:19:06,690 --> 00:19:08,550
where in the hell does that
hundred years come from?

287
00:19:08,551 --> 00:19:12,390
Why isn't it a thousand years as I say
here on million years or just 10 years?

288
00:19:12,391 --> 00:19:16,980
Why isn't everybody dead already like
a mouse? If you're all mice by the way,

289
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:21,600
mice, tissue mice, uh,
almost identical to ours.

290
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:25,830
So why is it the bed dead? They would
all be dead if he were all mice.

291
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:29,160
So why is that?
Where does that number come from?

292
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:33,660
How is it generated from
mini color scales or um, why,

293
00:19:33,661 --> 00:19:37,710
why is it that most of us had to sleep
with the order of eight hours last night?

294
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:40,260
Why not 15 or 16?

295
00:19:40,290 --> 00:19:43,200
One can mounts or three or four,

296
00:19:43,201 --> 00:19:47,310
like an elephant has to see three or
four years and the way you're learning a

297
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:50,190
couple of hours. So we're in the hell
do those numbers come from? What is,

298
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:54,240
what is the dynamic that's
giving rise to those? And um,

299
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:59,060
uh, so these are coarse grained
questions and the answers will be caused,

300
00:19:59,061 --> 00:19:59,850
screened.

301
00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:04,800
The idea that you can predict the
lifespan of a particular individual is,

302
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:06,990
maybe you could do it
with some probability,

303
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:11,310
but the idea that you can predict it
accurately is clearly not feasible.

304
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:16,050
So similarly, when we move
into the socioeconomic things,
I'll citizen companies,

305
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:19,840
just large organisms they came
out of biology is, you know,

306
00:20:19,841 --> 00:20:24,300
to what extent is Google
or Seattle biological, um,

307
00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:28,230
and why is it that a given that,
that we all die,

308
00:20:28,231 --> 00:20:30,540
which you've already talked about,
but all companies die.

309
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:33,960
But cities almost never do.
It's almost impossible to kill the city.

310
00:20:33,961 --> 00:20:35,760
You can think of cities that have died,

311
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:41,280
but to modern times you could do
dropped atom bombs on cities and uh,

312
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:46,320
25 years later they're fine.
Whereas a small fluctuation,

313
00:20:46,321 --> 00:20:49,180
relatively speaking in the
stock market and you lose,

314
00:20:49,181 --> 00:20:54,170
lose a twa or Lehmann brothers,
et cetera. So companies are,

315
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:57,610
are fragile, cities are very
resilient. And you could ask,

316
00:20:57,611 --> 00:21:00,670
could you get a series of
components and could you predict?

317
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:04,120
And here you're going to throw me
out when Google would disappear,

318
00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:09,520
as I will show you a whole companies
eventually will like human beings.

319
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:11,080
So there's just a picture.

320
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:16,500
So you know what happens here or what
happened here for crying out loud.

321
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:24,400
Mick Jagger lie have it to come from the
same part of London are the same age.

322
00:21:24,401 --> 00:21:28,370
So they, uh, so here's the,
here's we, one of these.

323
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:34,090
We want to, we are a mammal. And
despite the fact that, uh, you know,

324
00:21:34,091 --> 00:21:35,140
we look very different,

325
00:21:35,141 --> 00:21:37,780
we looked different from them and they
look different for each other and they,

326
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:41,560
uh, they're in their immediate
environment is quite different.

327
00:21:41,561 --> 00:21:45,600
It swims in the ocean and discoveries
around, we brought on two links,

328
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:49,750
nevertheless to an extraordinary
degree of accuracy,

329
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:54,310
18 90%. We are actually scaled
versions of one another.

330
00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:58,480
When you look at anything that you
can measure about the many thing

331
00:21:58,481 --> 00:22:03,460
physiological or anything about
their life history. So for example,

332
00:22:03,461 --> 00:22:05,230
here's the most fundamental quantity.

333
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:09,430
It's called metabolic rate and then how
much food you need to eat per day to

334
00:22:09,431 --> 00:22:12,730
stay alive.
And that's plotted on the vertical axis.

335
00:22:12,730 --> 00:22:16,720
And on the horizontal axis is the size
and it's partially logarithmically up by

336
00:22:16,721 --> 00:22:20,380
factors of 10. And what you see is
something extraordinary. Here's the most,

337
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:24,610
probably the most complex phenomenon
in the universe, metabolism,

338
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:27,400
taking stuff and making it into life.

339
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:33,070
Yet despite it being so extraordinary
complex and despite the fact that each one

340
00:22:34,541 --> 00:22:39,541
of these organisms as evolved by natural
selection with its own unique history,

341
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:44,470
each subcomponent, each organ of these
systems, each cell type is genome,

342
00:22:44,650 --> 00:22:46,870
has evolved with its own unique history,

343
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:51,910
in which case you see this idea of
so randomness of natural selection,

344
00:22:51,911 --> 00:22:53,950
in which case when you
plotted something like this,

345
00:22:54,190 --> 00:22:56,860
you expect these points
to be all over this graph.

346
00:22:57,010 --> 00:23:01,690
They've all lined up on a very simple
straight line when plot it in this way,

347
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:06,190
and of course you plotted logarithmically
at first because you got a mouse in an

348
00:23:06,191 --> 00:23:07,024
elephant.

349
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:11,530
If you tried to put the mouse here and
you wanted to put the elephant on the

350
00:23:11,531 --> 00:23:15,760
same graph and it were linear, of course
it would be somewhere, I dunno. In Tacoma.

351
00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:20,140
Yes. Anyway, so this is a way
of getting it on that side,

352
00:23:20,290 --> 00:23:24,250
on the same graph. And you can see
there's an extraordinary regularity,

353
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:25,900
extorting irregularities,

354
00:23:25,901 --> 00:23:30,901
even more amazing when you realize that
the slope of this line is less than one

355
00:23:32,321 --> 00:23:33,430
because if it were one,

356
00:23:33,431 --> 00:23:36,280
you sort of vaguely understand
it because if it were linear,

357
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:38,380
you said where he doubled
the size of an organism,

358
00:23:38,381 --> 00:23:39,910
you've doubled the number of cells.

359
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:44,500
Therefore you double the amount of energy
that's needed. Not the case at all.

360
00:23:44,501 --> 00:23:48,950
The slope of is I've written down is
very close to the 0.75 and three quarters

361
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:54,170
so that every time you double you
actually saved about 25% so there's an

362
00:23:54,171 --> 00:23:58,130
extraordinary economy of
scale as you go up in signs.

363
00:23:58,220 --> 00:24:01,220
So elephant is more economic,

364
00:24:01,710 --> 00:24:04,100
it's cells work less hard than yours,

365
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:08,240
but yours was work less hard
than your cats for example.

366
00:24:08,330 --> 00:24:13,040
So those two things are actually scaled
version to one another. So there it is,

367
00:24:13,041 --> 00:24:14,390
I said it again there,

368
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:19,070
but most importantly in addition
to this is that this is true of any

369
00:24:19,071 --> 00:24:23,480
physiological or life history event.
Here's a mundane one. This is heart rate,

370
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:25,370
your heart rate.
And you can see again,

371
00:24:25,371 --> 00:24:28,820
it's a pretty good straight
line on this log log part.

372
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:34,030
And the slope of this is close to minus
one quarter minus because it's negative

373
00:24:34,730 --> 00:24:38,360
and his, you, this is your white
matter, the gray matter in your brain.

374
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:43,750
This is the um, uh, the,
the cable is versus the,

375
00:24:43,751 --> 00:24:48,400
uh, the operating part. And you can
see this fantastic straight line.

376
00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:49,500
This is good.

377
00:24:49,570 --> 00:24:54,570
This is very close to five quarters is
jeans and there's more fluctuations here,

378
00:24:54,890 --> 00:24:58,040
but the slope is very
close to one quarter.

379
00:24:58,070 --> 00:25:02,190
And so what you see emerge from
this is this incredible, um,

380
00:25:02,930 --> 00:25:07,670
simplicity underlying this
extraordinary complexity. Um,

381
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:08,480
uh,

382
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:13,480
with something also amazing is that all
of these seem to have slopes that are

383
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,620
simple multiples of this number one,

384
00:25:15,621 --> 00:25:20,621
quarter four plays some
fundamental role in all of biology.

385
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:24,710
So when I could spend the rest
of the afternoon showing you

386
00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:31,270
75 or some of these damn graphs of almost
everything that can be measured looks

387
00:25:31,311 --> 00:25:35,540
like this. Um, now this is
not exactly an equation,

388
00:25:35,541 --> 00:25:39,080
but I decided to leave this
in any way. This, actually,

389
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:44,570
this actually is a copy of a
transparency I showed at that.

390
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:49,440
Google they, that's why
I put it in. So, um, so,

391
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:54,230
so I said heart rates decrease.
That's what that symbol means decrease.

392
00:25:54,670 --> 00:25:58,220
We're in that, we're plotting
it with a slope of one quarter,

393
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,820
but it turns out lifespan.

394
00:25:59,870 --> 00:26:04,870
How long you live approximately increases
increases with that slope of one

395
00:26:05,451 --> 00:26:08,510
quarter. So if you multiply
these two things together,

396
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:12,890
the increase of lifespan
going with plus one quarter,

397
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:18,440
the heart rate decreasing with one quart,
you multiply them together,

398
00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:23,360
the one quarters cancel. So heart
rate times lifespan is an invariant.

399
00:26:23,361 --> 00:26:24,980
Doesn't change what circle,

400
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:29,960
but what is heart rate times lifespan is
the number of heartbeats in a lifetime.

401
00:26:30,710 --> 00:26:33,350
And that's the same for all of us,

402
00:26:33,410 --> 00:26:38,410
which is spiritually beautiful and
scientifically challenging to understand.

403
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:44,470
And that number is about one and a half
billion times and is the data and see,

404
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:49,640
so this is number beats for lifespan
versus the size and rotten that's I can,

405
00:26:51,470 --> 00:26:53,580
those are quickly do the calculation.

406
00:26:53,581 --> 00:26:57,570
We are an exception for very good
reasons which have had had time.

407
00:26:57,930 --> 00:27:00,090
I will come back to it at the end.
So what the hell?

408
00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:04,530
Where the hell do all these
extraordinary scaling laws come from?

409
00:27:04,531 --> 00:27:06,090
What is it that's driving them?

410
00:27:06,091 --> 00:27:10,890
What is it that's constraining the
randomness and chaotic nature of natural

411
00:27:10,891 --> 00:27:11,724
selection?

412
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:17,540
And the idea that I developed with some
marvelous biologist was an underlying

413
00:27:18,031 --> 00:27:22,650
them is something that's common to all
these systems and is common in fact or

414
00:27:22,651 --> 00:27:25,950
socio economic systems.
And that is that you've got to,

415
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:29,330
you have huge numbers of
components and you have to service,

416
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:32,040
those were the cells,

417
00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:36,570
customers or workers you have to
serve as those in a roughly speaking,

418
00:27:36,810 --> 00:27:41,760
democratic, inefficient manner. And
you do that of course by networks.

419
00:27:41,761 --> 00:27:45,450
And those networks are typically
branching hierarchical networks.

420
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,300
So the idea is that
networks underlying this,

421
00:27:48,570 --> 00:27:52,740
and it is the mathematics and
physics of these networks,

422
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:57,000
these networks, there's different
kinds. There's that's you.

423
00:27:57,710 --> 00:28:02,330
This is also you that your brain
as the white to grey, right?

424
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:05,370
This is also you,
that's inside yourselves.

425
00:28:05,610 --> 00:28:09,750
And that that's a mitochondria
inside the cell. Now own networks.

426
00:28:09,751 --> 00:28:13,800
And the idea is that even though
these networks have different physical

427
00:28:13,801 --> 00:28:14,634
structures,

428
00:28:14,730 --> 00:28:19,730
the mathematics and the generic principles
underlying the structure and dynamics

429
00:28:20,131 --> 00:28:24,520
of flow on these networks are
universal and generic. Okay.

430
00:28:24,990 --> 00:28:25,980
So,
um,

431
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:32,280
so now you have this theory that, uh,
where you understand all of these, uh,

432
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:34,230
the list of scaling of all of these,

433
00:28:34,231 --> 00:28:38,340
but you also have a theory for
understanding how these networks work,

434
00:28:38,341 --> 00:28:40,200
not only the structure that is,

435
00:28:40,201 --> 00:28:45,201
if you wanted to ask me what is the
radius length blood flow rate a stress on

436
00:28:47,821 --> 00:28:52,200
the 12th branch of your arterial network.

437
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:53,820
There's a formula in my office,

438
00:28:53,821 --> 00:28:57,840
you can put in the numbers but in the
program and you'll get the right answer

439
00:28:57,930 --> 00:29:02,090
for a cat, a dog, a
hippopotamus, whenever. So it's,

440
00:29:02,190 --> 00:29:05,880
it's quite powerful. And, uh,
once you have such a theory,

441
00:29:05,881 --> 00:29:09,900
you can apply it to many things. And some
of them are things that I talked about,

442
00:29:09,901 --> 00:29:12,900
which I'm not going to talk about now,
like aging and sleep.

443
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:18,200
But some things I will talk about
very briefly is growth because,

444
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:22,550
uh, that's, that's crucial in
your development obviously.

445
00:29:22,890 --> 00:29:27,890
And it's come up with something
maybe that I just saw an opening.

446
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:34,500
Yes,
you gotta Ah,

447
00:29:34,650 --> 00:29:38,970
they are that you. So how did you grow?
Let's do this quickly before I go.

448
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:46,020
Um,
so what is that?

449
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:51,170
So you eat lunch, you're
metabolize the food. Uh,

450
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:56,180
it turns it into ATP molecules that
carry your energy and that gets delivered

451
00:29:57,221 --> 00:30:00,250
through the networks to
yourselves at the cells.

452
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:03,940
It repairs and maintains them.

453
00:30:03,941 --> 00:30:06,850
It replaces those that have
died and then grows new ones.

454
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:09,940
So there's the equation in English,

455
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:14,740
it's some goes to maintenance and some
goes to growth. And by the way, uh,

456
00:30:14,741 --> 00:30:18,580
I was in, in a few minutes, I'll
do this for cities and companies.

457
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:20,890
And it's the same equation basically.
I mean,

458
00:30:20,891 --> 00:30:22,990
you have to adjust what
you mean by these things,

459
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:26,980
but it's fundamentally the same if you do
that and you put that into mathematics,

460
00:30:26,981 --> 00:30:29,830
that English into mathematics
with this, the, the,

461
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:34,720
the theory that has been developed. Then
here's an example of this is our growth.

462
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:39,100
Our meaning mammals is a rat and a,
these are data points.

463
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:43,630
And that's the prediction of the theory.
And amazingly with the same parameters,

464
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:46,720
the same few parameters like
the of a sale and so on.

465
00:30:46,930 --> 00:30:51,930
You can predict the growth curve for
any animal and then the theory tells you

466
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:55,060
how to rescale all those results.

467
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:59,080
I could have shown you lots of those
growth goals so that everybody has to grow

468
00:30:59,081 --> 00:31:03,040
in the same way. And here's just
some small sampling of those.

469
00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:04,270
You see they all grow.

470
00:31:04,290 --> 00:31:09,190
They all fit on the same universal
curve that is predicted by the theory,

471
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:14,140
even by the way cancer tumors,
which are we'll come back to in a minute.

472
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:18,940
But the important thing is there's a
universal theory for growth and most

473
00:31:18,941 --> 00:31:23,890
importantly for what I want to say is
that in explains why it is that you grow

474
00:31:23,891 --> 00:31:28,891
quickly at the beginning and something
that should have maybe bothered you.

475
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:33,330
Why is it they should go on eating, which
you don't go on growing. I mean you,

476
00:31:33,331 --> 00:31:35,800
you do,
I mean a little bit this way,

477
00:31:35,801 --> 00:31:38,170
but you don't grow what's
called onto genetically.

478
00:31:38,171 --> 00:31:40,090
You stay pretty much the same size.

479
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:44,200
And then you have this stable
configuration you get into.

480
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:47,080
And by the way,
this,

481
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:52,140
this idea that most organisms reach a
stable size and stop growing is crucial.

482
00:31:54,101 --> 00:31:59,101
And the sustainability of life and why
life has been around for two to 3 billion

483
00:31:59,441 --> 00:32:04,420
years. Uh, and of course just
jumping ahead, this is terrible.

484
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:09,040
When you think of an economy or a
company or a city you're supposed to be,

485
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:11,920
you know, you're not supposed
to go bend over like that.

486
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:13,930
It's not supposed to start.
And,

487
00:32:13,990 --> 00:32:17,770
and what is also very
important is the reason,

488
00:32:17,771 --> 00:32:20,860
if you trace back why
is you stopped growing.

489
00:32:21,130 --> 00:32:25,180
It is intimately related to this
what I called sub linear scaling.

490
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:29,260
The fact that metabolic rate
scaled with an exponent,

491
00:32:29,290 --> 00:32:32,110
meaning that slope of that
graph with less than one,

492
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:37,360
the three quarters was crucial
that it goes, this bends over.

493
00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:41,560
And I could elaborate on that.
Anyone's interested later. So there's,

494
00:32:41,610 --> 00:32:46,460
it's still showing great. So here's
a summary. Some biological things.

495
00:32:46,461 --> 00:32:49,160
We have these extraordinary
scaling ignores their nonlinear.

496
00:32:49,170 --> 00:32:52,040
There's these quarter pounders
and expresses an economy of scale.

497
00:32:52,190 --> 00:32:56,780
The bigger you are, the message needed
per cell per capita to stay in line. Uh,

498
00:32:56,940 --> 00:32:58,550
I didn't emphasize this,

499
00:32:58,551 --> 00:33:02,090
but going along with that sub linear
scaling is that the pace of life

500
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:04,260
systematically slows heart speed,

501
00:33:04,261 --> 00:33:09,140
slower oxygen diffuses
across membranes, uh, slower.

502
00:33:09,230 --> 00:33:10,310
You live longer.

503
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:15,360
And in fact you could contract a
elephants life completely down so that it

504
00:33:16,670 --> 00:33:21,320
overlaps exactly that of a mouse
if you follow the scheme north. Um,

505
00:33:21,590 --> 00:33:23,810
I said growth stocks,
growth stocks,

506
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:28,840
and I only intimated it you
die when Ben Ben's over.

507
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:33,620
Stop growing and then you die.
Okay,

508
00:33:33,650 --> 00:33:37,370
let's use this now as a point of
departure to talk about cities.

509
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:42,890
So I said this already. First question
is, is scaled versions of one another.

510
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:47,660
Is Seattle justice scaled
down New York City,

511
00:33:47,870 --> 00:33:52,550
which is a scaled up Santa fe where I
live or scaled down Chicago or they scaled

512
00:33:52,551 --> 00:33:56,630
version one, but it sure as hell don't
look alike. They have different histories,

513
00:33:56,631 --> 00:34:00,590
cultures, geographies and so
on. On the other hand, um,

514
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:02,900
their own network systems,

515
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:06,410
roads and electrical lines and so on,

516
00:34:06,470 --> 00:34:10,340
their transport systems and the
supplied by energy networks.

517
00:34:10,790 --> 00:34:15,320
And perhaps most importantly,
that I emphasized earlier. Um,

518
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:21,200
they will have people in them and,
uh, people form social networks.

519
00:34:21,201 --> 00:34:22,880
It's a classic social network,

520
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:27,800
social network nodes of people.
And those are the interactions.

521
00:34:27,801 --> 00:34:31,700
You're probably more familiar with this
than I am, but these are social networks.

522
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:35,570
Um, and two points I want
to emphasize about this.

523
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:40,780
One is that there's a modularity to these
networks generally because people have

524
00:34:41,751 --> 00:34:46,250
families and they have jobs with
groups and departments and so on.

525
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:49,940
So people have said it's
not just individuals,

526
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:55,000
but we formed groups of various sizes
and most importantly illustrated on this.

527
00:34:56,150 --> 00:35:00,620
You know, we tend to draw pictures like
this when we do our network theory. Um,

528
00:35:00,830 --> 00:35:04,280
but we tend to forget,
especially when used words like the cloud,

529
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:07,100
that all of these have to be somewhere.

530
00:35:07,101 --> 00:35:11,840
People have to be actually somewhere
when they're on their iPhone or on their

531
00:35:11,841 --> 00:35:16,730
computer or whatever, doing
Facebook. They have to be, you know,

532
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:20,690
on a road in the office, in the
bathroom somewhere. They have to be.

533
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:21,980
So they are glued,

534
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:26,330
people are glued whether they
like it or not to being in place.

535
00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:30,080
So there's an integration
between place and information.

536
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:34,430
So are they, are cities scaled
versions one or the other.

537
00:35:34,431 --> 00:35:38,910
But here's some first data that we
look at and this was something mundane.

538
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:43,940
This is gas stations petro here because
these people I worked with where we're

539
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:48,730
at the eth in Zurich,
uh,

540
00:35:48,990 --> 00:35:51,480
and uh,
you can see this is a,

541
00:35:51,481 --> 00:35:55,290
there's four European cities and
you've seen bay scale pretty well.

542
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:58,950
And the dotted line is the youngest
like biology, it's sub linear.

543
00:35:59,010 --> 00:36:02,910
That is the bigger the city,
the less gas stations needed per capita.

544
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:06,750
Not Surprising, but what is surprising
is there are roughly the same slope,

545
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:09,960
meaning that you're saying the
same amount every time you double,

546
00:36:09,961 --> 00:36:12,900
no matter where you are.
And that is about 15%.

547
00:36:12,901 --> 00:36:17,100
The slope of this is about point a
five rather than 0.75 in biology.

548
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:22,050
Furthermore,
if you look at any infrastructure that is,

549
00:36:22,051 --> 00:36:24,030
if you look at the
length of all the roads,

550
00:36:24,031 --> 00:36:26,550
you look at the length of all the
electrical lines, the power, the,

551
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:30,180
the how many mortar lines,
the gas line, whatever,

552
00:36:30,181 --> 00:36:34,770
whatever you can measure
about infrastructure. They
all have this character,

553
00:36:34,830 --> 00:36:36,780
they all scale in this way.

554
00:36:36,781 --> 00:36:41,760
They all scare with the same smoke
about 0.85 and it's the same,

555
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:46,620
not just in these four European
cities for European countries,

556
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:50,550
but across Europe, across the United
States, across China, across Japan,

557
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,050
Colombia, Chile, wherever,

558
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:56,010
wherever you can get data
and look exactly like this,

559
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:58,290
all infrastructure scales in the same way.

560
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:01,530
And one interesting consequence
of that is in a sense,

561
00:37:01,531 --> 00:37:05,010
you get this economy of scale.
That means the bigger the city,

562
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:07,860
the less entropy that is produced.

563
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:10,480
And therefore it's up here.

564
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:14,940
The carbon footprint gets lower
per capita, the bigger the city.

565
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:19,980
So the greenest city in the United
States is New York City and one of the

566
00:37:19,981 --> 00:37:22,710
shittiest in that sense,
a Santa fe where I live,

567
00:37:22,830 --> 00:37:27,000
even though it's in Delek
compared to living in New York.

568
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:29,820
So, uh, that's fantastic.

569
00:37:29,821 --> 00:37:33,300
But what is even more amazing is
if you look at socioeconomic wants.

570
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:38,300
It is things that never existed until we
started learning language and building

571
00:37:39,631 --> 00:37:41,910
communities and ultimately cities,

572
00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:47,150
things like wages and something called
someone named Richard Florida called

573
00:37:47,701 --> 00:37:50,580
super creative people like everybody here,
professional people.

574
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:54,560
If you ask how does that scale with city
size parked it in the same logarithmic

575
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:59,490
boy, then you get a similar as
more fluctuations, more noise,

576
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:04,380
but you get scaling but you get a slope.
There is now bigger than one.

577
00:38:04,650 --> 00:38:06,270
It's called Super Linear scaling,

578
00:38:06,271 --> 00:38:10,020
which means that instead of
every time where as you increase,

579
00:38:10,021 --> 00:38:12,360
you get an economy of scale.
The bigger you are,

580
00:38:12,361 --> 00:38:17,100
the less per capita for
socioeconomic quantities, wages,

581
00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:18,780
super creative people.

582
00:38:18,990 --> 00:38:23,550
Bigger you are the more per capita and
the slopes of these are quite similar

583
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:28,470
around 1.15 what is amazing is that
that's the same for most everything else.

584
00:38:28,471 --> 00:38:29,400
I didn't write it on here.

585
00:38:29,401 --> 00:38:32,500
This is the patents produced as
a function of synthesize size.

586
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:37,500
This is just over 1.15 this crime
in Japan there's a bit bigger.

587
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:40,180
This is police tax receipts,

588
00:38:40,181 --> 00:38:43,270
construction restaurants
and Holland and so on.

589
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:47,650
And here's just a small panel of half a
dozen of these different variables whose

590
00:38:47,651 --> 00:38:52,030
wages are just showed you. Here's
the GDP of France is crime in Japan.

591
00:38:52,150 --> 00:38:57,010
And you can see they all have pretty
much the same slope so that any socio,

592
00:38:57,011 --> 00:38:59,890
not socio economic variable,
no matter what it is,

593
00:39:00,310 --> 00:39:04,240
no matter where it is across the
globe scales in the same way,

594
00:39:04,690 --> 00:39:09,690
which is sort of extraordinary because
there wasn't a congress in 1782 where all

595
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:14,920
the countries of the world decided this
is how we're going to build cities and

596
00:39:14,921 --> 00:39:17,770
this is how I'm going to build
our socioeconomics system.

597
00:39:18,130 --> 00:39:23,130
And all evolved organically and
amazingly out of all that came something

598
00:39:23,290 --> 00:39:26,050
universal and similar.
Um,

599
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:30,370
and here's just for the United
States, this is just income, GDP.

600
00:39:30,370 --> 00:39:34,540
Private patents readjusted but
to the same scale, but send,

601
00:39:34,541 --> 00:39:37,930
you can see the same slope.
There's quite a bit of noise in it,

602
00:39:37,931 --> 00:39:40,860
but you can see overall
it's the same kind of thing.

603
00:39:40,970 --> 00:39:45,580
And one of the big questions is, when
the hell does all this come from, why is,

604
00:39:45,610 --> 00:39:49,170
why should that be? So
here it is in English. Uh,

605
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:53,770
if you double the size of a city, you
know, give an urban system on average,

606
00:39:54,010 --> 00:39:56,680
uh, systematically the income, well,

607
00:39:58,230 --> 00:40:01,180
number of colleges,
educational places created people,

608
00:40:01,270 --> 00:40:06,170
but also all these bad things, please
aids, flu, crime, social and oh,

609
00:40:06,171 --> 00:40:11,171
these things all increased by about 15%
and at the same time you save 15% on own

610
00:40:12,911 --> 00:40:15,160
infrastructure.
So big cities a good,

611
00:40:16,250 --> 00:40:20,650
if you sort of ignore this, which people
are very good at suppressing crime,

612
00:40:20,651 --> 00:40:25,120
pollution, disease, a big cities, a
good and big bigger cities, even better.

613
00:40:25,510 --> 00:40:27,910
So we're in the hell. Does all this
come from? So you ask yourself,

614
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:32,160
what is universal about all cities?
What is common across all cities?

615
00:40:32,350 --> 00:40:35,110
And what you quickly realize.
There's something I've emphasized earlier.

616
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:38,260
The thing that's common is
that they are for people,

617
00:40:38,890 --> 00:40:42,400
and it may sound sort of obvious,
but amazingly,

618
00:40:42,401 --> 00:40:45,190
if you become familiar
with urban planning,

619
00:40:45,310 --> 00:40:47,530
urban architecture of an economics,

620
00:40:47,650 --> 00:40:51,490
what you discover is people
rarely play any role in those.

621
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:56,470
Those subjects was dominated by the
physicality and pure economics of the

622
00:40:56,471 --> 00:40:57,304
system.

623
00:40:57,310 --> 00:41:02,310
And so the idea is in is the universality
of the mathematics and physics of

624
00:41:03,251 --> 00:41:07,300
social networks. The interaction
of people do this underlying this.

625
00:41:07,301 --> 00:41:11,800
And I don't have time again to go into
any of the mathematics and the details of

626
00:41:11,801 --> 00:41:15,910
this to show you where it
comes from. Uh, but um,

627
00:41:16,210 --> 00:41:18,130
one thing I will show
you is the following,

628
00:41:18,131 --> 00:41:22,600
one crucial thing of course about
science is not just to have a theory that

629
00:41:22,601 --> 00:41:27,370
explains the observations,
but to predict things. And a,

630
00:41:27,371 --> 00:41:30,430
so I'm going to be one prediction that
you can make without having to see the

631
00:41:30,431 --> 00:41:34,100
theory just based on that idea.
That's what I just showed you.

632
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:36,330
And the idea is that the,

633
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:41,410
the universality of that is because of
the universality of human interactions.

634
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:43,401
Uh,

635
00:41:43,401 --> 00:41:48,401
so if we could measure the number of
the interaction between people as a

636
00:41:48,681 --> 00:41:53,120
function of city size, it
should track this. Okay.

637
00:41:53,121 --> 00:41:57,200
So how do you do that? Well, that's
been very hard until recently,

638
00:41:57,201 --> 00:42:00,530
but now everybody carries of course,
cell phone,

639
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:03,380
which means everybody has a
little detective with them.

640
00:42:03,650 --> 00:42:08,330
Sure you're very familiar with, with like
maybe probably exploited in many ways,

641
00:42:08,331 --> 00:42:13,070
I'm sure. Uh, but everybody
has one. And so it's like,

642
00:42:13,670 --> 00:42:16,010
it's like the molecules in this room,
of course,

643
00:42:16,011 --> 00:42:20,240
it's almost as if everyone is tagged so
we know exactly where it is, you know,

644
00:42:20,510 --> 00:42:22,970
where it's moving with
interacting with and so on.

645
00:42:23,390 --> 00:42:25,550
So with some colleagues at MIT,

646
00:42:25,551 --> 00:42:30,551
we were able to get hold of this data
of billions and billions of a cell phone

647
00:42:31,101 --> 00:42:36,101
calls between people in
various places and then just,

648
00:42:36,971 --> 00:42:39,070
uh, do the analysis and count, uh,

649
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:43,250
how the number of interactions between
people scope, city size. And by the way,

650
00:42:43,251 --> 00:42:47,300
an interaction was I call you.
And within six months you call me back.

651
00:42:47,301 --> 00:42:51,170
So we have a relationship now, six
months, if you could make it three months,

652
00:42:51,171 --> 00:42:53,320
you can make it through.
It's up to you. But, um,

653
00:42:54,110 --> 00:42:59,030
we to establish an interaction,
a relationship. So we did that.

654
00:42:59,031 --> 00:43:00,210
And here's the result.

655
00:43:00,211 --> 00:43:03,560
And you see down the bottom and you
see it's not the same slope as this.

656
00:43:03,770 --> 00:43:05,780
And there's two countries on this planet.

657
00:43:05,810 --> 00:43:08,180
One is the UK and the other is Portugal.

658
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:11,420
And you can see it agrees
with the predictions.

659
00:43:11,421 --> 00:43:15,410
So it's very strong evidence
that underlying this is
and this theory of social

660
00:43:15,411 --> 00:43:17,870
networks.
Now I'm going to finish off very quickly.

661
00:43:17,871 --> 00:43:20,150
I've gone too long being
delayed by some of this,

662
00:43:20,151 --> 00:43:23,900
but I'll try to finish off
very quickly. Um, first of all,

663
00:43:24,230 --> 00:43:29,230
I mentioned earlier that the
network dynamics in biology
leads to the slowing of

664
00:43:29,241 --> 00:43:32,870
the pace of life. That's the
sub linear, the three quarters,

665
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:38,110
the super linear behavior of socioeconomic
metrics and the network underlying

666
00:43:39,801 --> 00:43:42,380
it. And by the way, I should
say one thing about the network.

667
00:43:42,740 --> 00:43:47,740
The super linearity comes about because
of the positive feedback loops that we

668
00:43:48,651 --> 00:43:51,050
create. When we interact. I talked to you,

669
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:54,920
you have a discussion that you talked to
him and then we three have a discussion

670
00:43:54,921 --> 00:43:56,600
and a blood. It's what
goes on here. Of course,

671
00:43:56,601 --> 00:43:58,430
that's what makes the whole system work.

672
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:02,180
And that has this positive
exponentiate eating behavior,

673
00:44:02,330 --> 00:44:04,460
which leads to the super linear behavior.

674
00:44:04,490 --> 00:44:08,690
That's sort of the words for the
mathematics that goes into this. Uh,

675
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:13,250
but that leads also has this curious
thing that if you have the superintendent

676
00:44:13,270 --> 00:44:15,380
behavior and sort of the
pace of life slowing down,

677
00:44:15,410 --> 00:44:19,070
it speeds up in a
predictable fashion and his,

678
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:23,480
so we've looked at many things
that in his one whimsical one,

679
00:44:23,810 --> 00:44:27,500
this is heart rates,
this is biology decreasing with sides.

680
00:44:27,830 --> 00:44:31,470
This is walking speed in
cities as a function of size.

681
00:44:31,770 --> 00:44:35,010
And this is pushing the theory
a little bit, but you know,

682
00:44:35,011 --> 00:44:39,390
you're still part of a network when
you're walking and you can see it's as

683
00:44:39,530 --> 00:44:42,180
fluctuations.
This is ancient data by the way.

684
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:46,740
It wasn't part of this this way, but you
can see it's very good. And that was,

685
00:44:47,010 --> 00:44:50,220
that was basically the,
that was the prediction from the theory.

686
00:44:50,670 --> 00:44:52,380
And interestingly,

687
00:44:53,310 --> 00:44:57,480
here's something that I found in a
British newspaper a few months ago.

688
00:44:57,540 --> 00:45:02,100
This is the city of Liverpool.
And here's what it says underneath,

689
00:45:02,670 --> 00:45:07,670
there's amazing research revealed almost
half the nation fouled the slow pace of

690
00:45:07,891 --> 00:45:11,970
high streets to be the
biggest shopping bugbear,

691
00:45:13,170 --> 00:45:16,530
not that noise and the
pollution and all the rest.

692
00:45:16,620 --> 00:45:20,100
It's the other fucking
people going too slow. Sorry.

693
00:45:22,250 --> 00:45:23,520
Take it as frustration.

694
00:45:26,580 --> 00:45:30,480
And here it is. So here
is a fast lane. They put a

695
00:45:32,390 --> 00:45:34,810
fast lane for walkers.
There's just from as a niche,

696
00:45:34,811 --> 00:45:36,240
that was the first thing they did it.

697
00:45:37,110 --> 00:45:39,270
So I'm going to miss this
and marvelous quote here.

698
00:45:39,330 --> 00:45:44,330
Oh here's something I see you buying
the iPhone five and then shortly after

699
00:45:44,790 --> 00:45:46,110
Apple Watch and some old one,

700
00:45:46,170 --> 00:45:50,160
the iPhone six and then we've got the
bloody iPhone seven driving us nuts.

701
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:53,640
Okay, onward. So here's
the growth equation.

702
00:45:54,150 --> 00:45:57,630
I want to go quickly through growth.
So it's the same kind of thing.

703
00:45:57,631 --> 00:46:01,610
I sent it earlier. You know
what you have to cost. No,

704
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:05,580
you got to add up everything that's
coming in and some goes to maintain

705
00:46:05,581 --> 00:46:10,320
everything that's here or maintain
all the city streets and the roads and

706
00:46:10,321 --> 00:46:15,000
maintain all the people and some roads
grows new infrastructure and roads,

707
00:46:15,190 --> 00:46:17,390
new people and so on.
So you have to put that on.

708
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:22,020
This is just a cartoon of it and you're
taught them to mathematics. And when you,

709
00:46:22,170 --> 00:46:24,840
when you did an embark,
Jim got this, you saw,

710
00:46:25,140 --> 00:46:27,360
but now the input,

711
00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:32,420
all of this is super linear and
that instead of giving rise to this,

712
00:46:33,121 --> 00:46:37,620
which would be a disaster
in a socioeconomic system
from our modern capitalist

713
00:46:37,621 --> 00:46:42,420
viewpoint you get, and I just do cartoon
versions of this to give you an idea,

714
00:46:42,510 --> 00:46:44,340
it gives you something very satisfying,

715
00:46:44,341 --> 00:46:46,920
gives you this faster
than exponential growth,

716
00:46:46,921 --> 00:46:50,640
which is what we've seen and I'm not going
to have time to show you all the data

717
00:46:50,641 --> 00:46:53,610
that agrees with this and that's
fantastic. So it's very satisfying.

718
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:57,090
The theory is very self
consistent and is very predictive,

719
00:46:57,330 --> 00:46:59,790
but it has a fatal flaw.

720
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:03,060
And you've heard this in different forms.

721
00:47:03,061 --> 00:47:08,061
I'm sure that fatal flaw is this Duffy
line because what the theory says is that

722
00:47:08,071 --> 00:47:12,960
you go to an infinite size of whatever
the metric is that y'all are looking at

723
00:47:13,170 --> 00:47:14,460
in a finite time.

724
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:18,210
This is called mathematically
a finite time singularity.

725
00:47:18,930 --> 00:47:20,520
That's obviously nonsense.

726
00:47:20,521 --> 00:47:25,521
You can't have an infinite number of AIDS
cases or infinite number of a infinite

727
00:47:27,210 --> 00:47:31,480
amount of wages or whatever you them to.
So somewhere along here,

728
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:32,650
something changes.

729
00:47:32,651 --> 00:47:36,620
And the theory tells you that the theory
tells you what happens is that as you

730
00:47:36,621 --> 00:47:41,440
approach that singularity, the system
stagnates and then it collapses.

731
00:47:41,620 --> 00:47:44,290
That's what I'd done yet.
So just symbolically written it here.

732
00:47:44,530 --> 00:47:47,790
And that's terrible. Of course.
And that's what we don't want. Uh,

733
00:47:48,190 --> 00:47:51,570
and so the question is how do
we avoid it? Well, we avoided

734
00:47:53,140 --> 00:47:54,250
as we're going along here,

735
00:47:54,251 --> 00:47:58,240
when you realize that of course it's
growth was done within a certain set

736
00:47:58,241 --> 00:48:01,680
paradigm. Certain major
innovation, we discover cold.

737
00:48:01,690 --> 00:48:06,600
What we discovered iron 20,000
years ago or whenever it was a,

738
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:10,120
we invented computers, we
discovered it. Whatever it is,

739
00:48:10,121 --> 00:48:13,210
something is,
it sets the,

740
00:48:13,211 --> 00:48:17,770
so to speak the backdrop for this.
So it's clear.

741
00:48:17,771 --> 00:48:22,000
If you want to have open endedly group
continue up in any growth somewhere along

742
00:48:22,001 --> 00:48:26,560
here before stagnation and collapse
sets in, you better start over again.

743
00:48:26,710 --> 00:48:30,220
And you do that by major innovation.
So innovation,

744
00:48:30,730 --> 00:48:35,730
nothing new is the thing that resets the
clock and you can start over again and

745
00:48:36,011 --> 00:48:39,670
avoid the collapse inherent
in that senior narrative.

746
00:48:39,820 --> 00:48:44,110
So you start over again,
a book off you go and that's great.

747
00:48:44,290 --> 00:48:49,290
But there's a not the singularity is
going to come cause the same dynamic.

748
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:52,750
So you better do it again.
Sorry. It didn't, somehow

749
00:48:54,450 --> 00:48:59,440
that's supposed to be there.
Uh, and so on. I'm sorry.
Then what happened here. Yeah,

750
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:03,880
but you get the idea. So you
had this idea. So you have
a theorem you can produce.

751
00:49:03,881 --> 00:49:05,860
If you want to have open ended growth,

752
00:49:05,861 --> 00:49:10,861
you have to have continuous cycles
of paradigm shifting innovations.

753
00:49:13,030 --> 00:49:16,510
Great. However, is the hitch. I said,

754
00:49:16,511 --> 00:49:20,890
if you go along one of these curves, my
wife gets faster, life is speeding up.

755
00:49:21,220 --> 00:49:22,600
But along with that,

756
00:49:23,020 --> 00:49:27,970
the time between these innovations as
the systematically and predictably get

757
00:49:27,971 --> 00:49:32,890
shorter and shorter. So the
time between innovations, uh,

758
00:49:32,950 --> 00:49:36,930
necessarily get shorter.
And uh,

759
00:49:36,940 --> 00:49:38,890
so just to make up some numbers,

760
00:49:39,250 --> 00:49:44,140
if it took a hundred years to make
a major change a thousand years ago,

761
00:49:44,350 --> 00:49:48,930
now it only takes 15 to 20
years. And so indeed the, uh,

762
00:49:49,010 --> 00:49:53,410
the time between, you know, so
to speak, computers, laptops,

763
00:49:53,411 --> 00:49:57,610
and uh, it was maybe 20,
30 years. I know, whatever.

764
00:49:58,180 --> 00:50:01,840
And so what this says is if you want to
avoid collapse, you got to do it again.

765
00:50:01,850 --> 00:50:02,683
You've got to do it soon.

766
00:50:02,860 --> 00:50:07,860
If I told the analysis shows you've got
to do another major innovation analogous

767
00:50:08,621 --> 00:50:11,440
to it in the next 20 years,

768
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:15,730
and we can speculate as to
what that might be. If not,

769
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:20,760
we're going to have a
potential crisis on our hands.

770
00:50:20,831 --> 00:50:25,100
Now, this is not my, I don't know who this
guy is, but I picked it off, but, uh, I,

771
00:50:25,110 --> 00:50:28,580
I got permission to use it. Uh, it's, uh,

772
00:50:28,610 --> 00:50:30,320
but it's someone that did some analysis.

773
00:50:30,321 --> 00:50:33,290
I'm just tying to reach 10 million
customers just to give you a sense.

774
00:50:33,291 --> 00:50:38,000
And it's very similar. And then,
you know, very cuts while has,

775
00:50:38,990 --> 00:50:41,750
has a different view of the
singularity likes the singularity,

776
00:50:41,751 --> 00:50:45,680
but the singularity is sort of
like the coming of the Messiah, uh,

777
00:50:45,681 --> 00:50:50,360
whereas I see a quite the opposite.
But this is his graph actually. And a,

778
00:50:50,361 --> 00:50:53,960
what you see is that in line is,
uh,

779
00:50:54,170 --> 00:50:57,620
what's plotted here is, um, along here,

780
00:50:57,710 --> 00:51:02,540
how long ago and innovation took place
of cells took place a billion years ago

781
00:51:02,541 --> 00:51:04,650
almost. Uh, but, uh,

782
00:51:04,700 --> 00:51:09,440
how long it took to make the
change in the news Billy news ago.

783
00:51:09,620 --> 00:51:14,540
Now it's, you know, 15
years, 15 years ago. So,

784
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:17,330
and you can fit it all
on the logarithmic plot.

785
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:22,470
This line is exactly what's
predicted by this theory. You know,

786
00:51:22,490 --> 00:51:26,300
I just tried to outline for you,
so I'm going to finish up very quickly,

787
00:51:26,301 --> 00:51:29,780
extremely quickly. Um,
and I leave hanging.

788
00:51:29,930 --> 00:51:33,570
The question is to, you know what, what,

789
00:51:34,780 --> 00:51:39,220
let's go back to this. What happens
here? You know, the question of collapse,

790
00:51:39,340 --> 00:51:44,050
Ultima collapse. Because if you take
the argument to its absurd conclusion,

791
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:49,200
you would have to be making a major
paradigm shift every two years,

792
00:51:49,511 --> 00:51:52,990
then read one year and then
every six months, obviously
not. So something has to,

793
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:55,300
as the change.
Okay?

794
00:51:55,330 --> 00:51:59,050
So I want to finish off
extremely quickly with a,

795
00:51:59,140 --> 00:52:02,890
if I can get there with companies.
So here's a,

796
00:52:04,060 --> 00:52:05,800
here's a summary.
I'm just some cub.

797
00:52:05,830 --> 00:52:09,610
I mean I can show you all the data if
anyone's interested with companies and

798
00:52:09,611 --> 00:52:12,460
what's plotted here. Assets and
income. Just to give you a sense,

799
00:52:12,610 --> 00:52:15,550
the important take home
messages here and what this is,

800
00:52:15,580 --> 00:52:18,380
I think this is Walmart is one of the,
uh,

801
00:52:18,550 --> 00:52:21,220
and you see this some fluctuations here,

802
00:52:21,221 --> 00:52:23,290
but you see this is party
versus number employees.

803
00:52:23,291 --> 00:52:25,870
These a tiny companies of
10 to a hundred people.

804
00:52:26,140 --> 00:52:30,130
But once it gets to be a substantial size,
they followed the scaling pretty well.

805
00:52:30,250 --> 00:52:32,980
And the important thing about
this that it's sub linear.

806
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:37,930
It's not like it's more
like us. It is not like, um,

807
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:40,540
cities.
And if you follow the argument through,

808
00:52:40,541 --> 00:52:43,690
and this is what I'm going to zoom,
what did that say?

809
00:52:44,230 --> 00:52:48,950
It said that you stopped growing
and your die.

810
00:52:49,820 --> 00:52:52,190
Okay? So let's look at
that. Here's the data.

811
00:52:52,220 --> 00:52:57,220
This is 30,000 US publicly traded
companies from 1950 to 2010,

812
00:53:02,360 --> 00:53:06,560
just all on one plot. Big
Spaghetti plots, every single one,

813
00:53:07,150 --> 00:53:10,920
okay. And uh, what you see is
what you sort of know here.

814
00:53:10,921 --> 00:53:14,630
They're all these new ones and
human fucking stupid zooming away.

815
00:53:14,990 --> 00:53:16,520
But look at these old farts,

816
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:20,830
they just sort of hanging in there and
it's going along the top like that.

817
00:53:20,930 --> 00:53:24,950
Now they are this. And then as you see
inflation's been taking out on this,

818
00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:30,320
so the old farts like me and this on
limping along and all the young Turks like

819
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:36,040
you're zooming and forth and here it
is readjusted to the stock market,

820
00:53:36,700 --> 00:53:39,930
the GDP.
And there it is.

821
00:53:40,230 --> 00:53:41,940
And you can see the dead flat,

822
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:47,700
which means that a big enough fluctuation
of the stock market and you're in

823
00:53:47,701 --> 00:53:52,050
trouble. That's one reason why
companies die. And I won't go.

824
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:55,920
I don't have time in this cause I've
gone on too long to tell you about the

825
00:53:55,921 --> 00:53:59,790
dynamic of that. That red
line, by the way, it's daunting

826
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:05,620
going along. And I can tell you about
Boeing cause I've worked with boy. Um,

827
00:54:06,150 --> 00:54:07,560
so here's the growth.

828
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:11,520
That's Walmart looking
like a big hockey stick.

829
00:54:12,540 --> 00:54:16,110
But you notice it only goes
in 1994 and here it is,

830
00:54:16,740 --> 00:54:21,210
take into 2008 and that red line
is a prediction of this theory.

831
00:54:21,420 --> 00:54:23,580
And you can see it's
beginning to bend over.

832
00:54:23,820 --> 00:54:27,540
And we'll go the way of all companies.
It will join.

833
00:54:27,570 --> 00:54:32,400
It is already joining this, this lot
and we'll bend over and the question is,

834
00:54:34,230 --> 00:54:37,410
will eventually die.
And this is what this last graph is.

835
00:54:38,010 --> 00:54:42,510
This is plotted, um, what's
just focus on one of these.

836
00:54:42,630 --> 00:54:47,630
This is the probability of dying versus
the company age and it's broken down

837
00:54:49,111 --> 00:54:51,540
into companies of different sizes.

838
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:55,890
And this is divided into those that
disappear through acquisition and merger.

839
00:54:56,130 --> 00:54:58,050
Those be bankruptcy and liquidation.

840
00:54:58,320 --> 00:55:03,300
But this is one see 100% probability.

841
00:55:03,340 --> 00:55:07,410
So it's very unlikely. It's very rare
for a company to live a hundred years,

842
00:55:07,411 --> 00:55:10,370
you know, I need to do of the, um,

843
00:55:10,371 --> 00:55:15,290
and it's very rare for a company
to go two to 300 years. Um, and uh,

844
00:55:15,300 --> 00:55:18,450
I don't, I don't have time to discuss
that. I discuss it in the book.

845
00:55:18,451 --> 00:55:22,950
I discussed lots of investigations
to be done in an ansys be done.

846
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:26,820
So our finished there, um, I
didn't complete everything,

847
00:55:26,821 --> 00:55:30,080
but I want to show you one last
graph. I went on way too long. Uh,

848
00:55:30,210 --> 00:55:31,043
there's this one,

849
00:55:31,170 --> 00:55:34,310
one thing I didn't say when we were
discussing metabolism is that, you know,

850
00:55:34,320 --> 00:55:39,320
what is sitting here desperately waiting
for me to finish is operating at 90

851
00:55:39,481 --> 00:55:42,710
watts. So you're, that's
all you're using. You know,

852
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:47,760
like you use my Nike ones and what says
on this grant is that if you think of

853
00:55:49,051 --> 00:55:53,850
your, that's how you evolve that you
are as a biological animal and Mammo,

854
00:55:53,880 --> 00:55:56,910
the fits perfectly on that metabolic rate.

855
00:55:57,750 --> 00:56:02,750
But if you ask the question
how much energy you need
to stay alive with the kind

856
00:56:03,781 --> 00:56:05,970
of socioeconomic activity you do,

857
00:56:05,971 --> 00:56:07,950
the kind of quality and
standard of living you have,

858
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:10,590
that number is 11,000 months.

859
00:56:10,890 --> 00:56:15,890
So that's equivalent to each one of us
in this room is acting as if we are about

860
00:56:17,130 --> 00:56:21,180
a dozen elephants or
about 70% of a blue one,

861
00:56:21,540 --> 00:56:26,080
which is almost as big as this
whole many. And uh, you know,

862
00:56:26,410 --> 00:56:30,190
most people, the seven and a half billion
people on this planet and all of them,

863
00:56:30,550 --> 00:56:34,390
all of them want to be like us. They all
want to live it never thousand watts.

864
00:56:34,660 --> 00:56:39,400
So this is a huge pressure.
So, um, uh, I haven't, uh,

865
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:43,990
I, I'm sort of stopped at before
telling you some speculations about,

866
00:56:44,380 --> 00:56:48,460
uh, you know, survival and collapsed
by viability, sustainability.

867
00:56:48,790 --> 00:56:52,510
But this is just puts the
numbers and to a perspective.

868
00:56:52,930 --> 00:56:55,870
So I finished that and I'm sorry,
I went on for too long.

869
00:56:55,871 --> 00:57:00,160
Some of it was due to this and some
was my home profligacy and, uh,

870
00:57:00,190 --> 00:57:02,260
just getting carried away.
So thank you.

871
00:57:03,250 --> 00:57:08,250
[inaudible] sleep

872
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:13,030
promote. I didn't rose. I put this
up here. It's all in the book,

873
00:57:15,110 --> 00:57:16,270
but no equations.
