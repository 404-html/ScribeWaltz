1
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:11,130
The niece is the founder and director
of the wild dolphin project and spent I

2
00:00:11,131 --> 00:00:14,850
think 32 years now observing
dolphins in the wild. Uh,

3
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:16,680
she and I have a research project,

4
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:20,280
a joint between Georgia tech
and the wild dolphin project.

5
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:22,630
We were trying to really,
uh,

6
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:25,500
look at two way communication
with wild dolphins.

7
00:00:25,501 --> 00:00:29,670
She's gonna give us a overview today of
her work and towards the end I got to

8
00:00:29,671 --> 00:00:31,830
show you some of the stuff
that y'all can get into,

9
00:00:32,050 --> 00:00:34,890
especially if you have some
background in machine learning.

10
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:37,410
So thank you very much for
coming to these, shall we?

11
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:43,460
Okay.
Well it's

12
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:47,920
great to be here. I'm glad you're all
here and listening. So like fad said, um,

13
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:51,260
I'm going to share with you a little bit
about our general dolphin work and how

14
00:00:51,261 --> 00:00:54,470
we work in the field and how we analyze
data and then we're going to talk about

15
00:00:54,471 --> 00:00:59,390
our joint projects and see if we can
intrigue any of you into the machine

16
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:01,160
learning world of dolphin sounds.

17
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:07,610
So every 20 years, national geographic
covers our work in the field.

18
00:01:07,611 --> 00:01:10,670
And a couple of years ago they did an
another story about thinking like a

19
00:01:10,671 --> 00:01:14,990
dolphin. And our work was highlighted,
uh, very much because that,

20
00:01:14,991 --> 00:01:19,400
and I have been working on trying to
crack the code of Dolphin communication in

21
00:01:19,401 --> 00:01:20,510
a couple different ways.

22
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:25,240
Now the reason we really think
dolphins have some potential, um,

23
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,960
they're kind of like
primates in the water.

24
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:31,670
On the upper left you see an example of
encephalization quotient, which is the,

25
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:34,910
uh,
physical measure of intelligence.

26
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:39,380
In some ways it's a brain to body ratio
and humans have a queue of about seven

27
00:01:39,381 --> 00:01:42,940
and dolphins are just second to humans,
even above the grade eight s.

28
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,570
So we know we have the physical store,

29
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:49,250
they have the physical
structure for intelligence. Um,
they use tools in the wild.

30
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:54,750
They've been known to understand
artificially presented
languages comprehending

31
00:01:54,891 --> 00:01:59,000
both syntax and semantics and they
recognize themselves in mirrors,

32
00:01:59,001 --> 00:02:00,920
which is no small feat lane.

33
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:05,450
But one of the big questions
still is do they have language,

34
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,790
do any nonhuman animals have language?

35
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:11,900
And my particular perspective is that
we really haven't looked close enough.

36
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:13,130
We suspect if,

37
00:02:13,131 --> 00:02:16,700
if you're a biologist you tend to
suspect that animals are doing a lot of

38
00:02:16,701 --> 00:02:18,080
complex communication.

39
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:21,380
We just haven't cracked the code
because we haven't had the tools.

40
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:27,380
Now collaboration with sad is
based on two different strategies.

41
00:02:27,381 --> 00:02:32,270
The first is a decoding the dolphins
natural sounds. So like he was mentioning,

42
00:02:32,271 --> 00:02:37,271
we have a a 32 year underwater acoustic
and a behavioral data set where we want

43
00:02:40,371 --> 00:02:43,610
to try to correlate sounds and behaviors
and look at some of the really detailed

44
00:02:43,611 --> 00:02:46,540
categories of their sounds using um,

45
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:51,050
kind of an anthropological framework. So
knowing their society, the individuals,

46
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,490
because it's a small resident group.

47
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,110
And the second way is to interface with
technology directly creating some kind

48
00:02:57,111 --> 00:03:01,930
of two way interface where
we can exploring perhaps a
mutual language and maybe

49
00:03:01,931 --> 00:03:04,720
learning back and forth
from both these strategies.

50
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:08,650
So first I'm going to tell you a little
bit about the specific dolphins that we

51
00:03:08,651 --> 00:03:12,160
work with and how we're approaching
the dolphin signals themselves.

52
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:14,950
A little bit about how
we analyze these signals.

53
00:03:14,951 --> 00:03:19,210
Some of the challenges working underwater
with a dolphin communication and

54
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:22,480
keeping in mind that we use
computers all the time as biologists.

55
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:25,630
And it's a really good marriage
and it's really necessary tool.

56
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:30,070
So dolphins have a lot of
different senses. Of course
they're great acquisitions,

57
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:31,750
but they also have pretty good vision,

58
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:34,180
especially a species
that live in Clearwater.

59
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:38,920
And they have cross modal
abilities between a vision
and sound. They have taste,

60
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:43,900
they do not have smell, and they
have touch. And in the, in the water,

61
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:44,530
uh,

62
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:48,760
tissue and water has about
the same acoustic impedance
so they can actually feel

63
00:03:48,761 --> 00:03:51,760
sound. So this becomes
another way they communicate.

64
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:58,920
So this is a summary of the history of
Dolphin communication using one of Gary

65
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:02,170
Larson's slides showing that
primarily we've worked in captivity.

66
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:05,710
We've tried to look at
acoustics and believe it or not,

67
00:04:05,711 --> 00:04:10,420
we've been looking for English, which
is a little scary, a little antiquated.

68
00:04:10,421 --> 00:04:13,920
So here you have this slide and the
scientists are hearing oblong to spend

69
00:04:13,921 --> 00:04:16,900
you'll and other Spanish phrases and
they have no idea what they're hearing,

70
00:04:16,901 --> 00:04:19,480
but they're writing it down.
So we've progressed,

71
00:04:19,481 --> 00:04:22,180
at least we want to look and see what
the dolphins themselves are doing and how

72
00:04:22,181 --> 00:04:26,770
they might structure a communication,
a system for a complex aquatic society.

73
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:30,760
So, um, we basically correlate video.

74
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:34,870
I'm Cindy Rogers and I'm the research
assistant at the broad off and project.

75
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:41,200
And I'm Michelle, I'm a graduate
student here. So, you know, it's funny,

76
00:04:41,201 --> 00:04:43,730
I was thinking when I was
in graduate school, uh,

77
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:46,660
one of my teachers told me there were
only a couple people in the world who

78
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:51,040
could read a spectrogram for human
speech, right? This is how old I am.

79
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:55,450
And now of course computers do it, but
we use the basic technique with dolphins.

80
00:04:55,451 --> 00:04:59,750
We take our video, we run the audio
track that correlates with the behavior,

81
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:01,200
some dolphin aggression.

82
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:22,380
So it's, it's busy place.
There's a lot of sounds. Um,

83
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:25,410
there's a lot of dolphins speaking sounds
and we don't always know who's making

84
00:05:25,411 --> 00:05:29,010
what sound, which is another issue.
So our project is in The Bahamas.

85
00:05:29,011 --> 00:05:33,060
So here you see this coast to Florida
across the Gulf stream are the shells

86
00:05:33,061 --> 00:05:35,520
sandbanks to The Bahamas and
the dolphins lived there.

87
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:38,370
It's great underwater visibility,

88
00:05:38,371 --> 00:05:41,220
which is why I chose to work there because
I want it to see what these animals

89
00:05:41,221 --> 00:05:43,980
were doing underwater,
not just looking at the surface,

90
00:05:43,981 --> 00:05:46,810
which is the case in most
parts of the world. Uh,

91
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:51,720
my nonprofit had a boat
donated Yay can 1992,

92
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,760
which is a great ocean going vessel.

93
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,590
So we lived there for four to five months
year. We do our work there, sleep there,

94
00:05:57,591 --> 00:05:58,161
we cook there,

95
00:05:58,161 --> 00:06:02,570
we analyze data out there and we go
where the dolphins are basically. And uh,

96
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:06,860
my main tool is underwater video with
a hydrophone underwater microphone of

97
00:06:06,861 --> 00:06:11,861
course simply to correlate Santa behavior
and try to get as much data with that

98
00:06:13,101 --> 00:06:15,950
equipment. Um, our project
is pretty noninvasive.

99
00:06:15,951 --> 00:06:20,951
We don't grab or tag the animals and we
have about 300 individuals track over

100
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:24,740
the decades and we're on our, actually
now we're on our fourth generation,

101
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,450
so we track that as well.

102
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:31,220
Now the species is actually a quite
convenient species to work with their

103
00:06:31,221 --> 00:06:35,540
Atlantic spotted dolphins and they don't
have any spots when they're born. Um,

104
00:06:35,541 --> 00:06:38,330
so here you see a mother fully grown at,

105
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:43,190
she's 35 years old here and we use id,
plastic ID techniques.

106
00:06:43,191 --> 00:06:47,120
We look at Dorsal Fin Nixon notches,
which most people use from surface work.

107
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:50,180
But because we work underwater
we can also look at body marks,

108
00:06:50,181 --> 00:06:52,340
full body marks because there are spots,

109
00:06:52,341 --> 00:06:55,430
we track their spots which are kind
of like constellations of stars.

110
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:59,540
So we do this id work every summer
cause they gained spots with age.

111
00:06:59,541 --> 00:07:00,410
And so we know,

112
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:05,440
we actually know all our dolphins in
most of which were born certain years.

113
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:10,130
So we can, we kind of take the broad
overview, the anthropological framework.

114
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:12,140
So we sex are dolphins because again,

115
00:07:12,141 --> 00:07:16,070
we're in the water and if you want a
little take home tidbit to tell your kids

116
00:07:16,071 --> 00:07:19,340
or your significant others, you can
tell them, you now know that to sex.

117
00:07:19,341 --> 00:07:20,091
A female dolphin,

118
00:07:20,091 --> 00:07:23,630
you look at the mammary slits on the
underside cause of course they nurse their

119
00:07:23,631 --> 00:07:28,040
young. Um, we know their reproductive
status, they're pregnant for about a year.

120
00:07:28,041 --> 00:07:32,900
They'll have three to four years
in between having calves. Uh,

121
00:07:32,901 --> 00:07:36,170
we know the females associate with
each other by reproductive status,

122
00:07:36,171 --> 00:07:37,490
so some are pregnant,

123
00:07:37,491 --> 00:07:42,050
they'll hang out with other pregnant
dolphins and the males have lifelong

124
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:44,840
friendships that they're form
when they're a juveniles.

125
00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:49,400
And their job is to not only try to mate
with females but to protect the group

126
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:52,070
and try to scout out sharks
and that sort of thing.

127
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:54,560
So we understand the
society a fair amounts.

128
00:07:54,561 --> 00:07:57,980
We have a lot of metadata around
our acoustic data as well.

129
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:00,560
And we do know some things
about dolphin sounds.

130
00:08:00,561 --> 00:08:03,620
We know they make whistles specifically
signature whistles, which are,

131
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:12,180
so these are long distance communication
signals that go three to five miles in

132
00:08:12,181 --> 00:08:15,210
the water for example,
on they make burst pulses,

133
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:16,463
which are

134
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:25,220
very funny sounding, sounds very hard
to categorize, but they're very social.

135
00:08:25,221 --> 00:08:28,850
This is probably the most common type
of dolphin sound and the least studied.

136
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:32,450
Okay.
Then

137
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:36,470
we had echolocation clicks,
which of course we know a
lot about from a navy work.

138
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:41,510
Um, and then we have a compressed
echolocation clicks, which we call buzzes.

139
00:08:41,511 --> 00:08:45,620
And these are social sounds,
um, unlike clicks for navigation

140
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:49,610
and there are these buses are
using courtship and discipline.

141
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:53,330
So we have some basic correlations
about what sounds they make with kind of

142
00:08:53,331 --> 00:08:54,440
gross behaviors.

143
00:08:56,070 --> 00:09:00,840
But what we'd really like to do is look
at the greater complexity potential. Now,

144
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:05,460
Dolphin research is always about 20,
25 years behind terrestrial research.

145
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:06,481
For example,

146
00:09:06,481 --> 00:09:11,280
we've known since I think 1992 that vervet
monkeys use different kinds of alarm

147
00:09:11,281 --> 00:09:15,060
calls to communicate that different
kinds of predators are coming.

148
00:09:15,061 --> 00:09:19,230
So very specific. There's eagle coming
or a leopard coming, so they're,

149
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,850
they're kin can take the
appropriate action. Um,

150
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:26,130
some fantastic work with prairie dogs
that really shows the complexity of the

151
00:09:26,131 --> 00:09:31,131
kind of information that can be encoded
in a very short alarm call and including

152
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:33,110
things like a human
with a yellow shirt on,

153
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:36,030
walking across a field with a gun
or not a gun, et Cetera, et cetera.

154
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:39,120
So there's a lot of things
these animals are doing.

155
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:43,350
And you can imagine a scenario where
a dolphin would be pretty handy if you

156
00:09:43,351 --> 00:09:47,070
could communicate whether the hammer heart
had shark was coming towards you or a

157
00:09:47,071 --> 00:09:51,000
tiger shark or great white shark. And my
really determined if you survive or not.

158
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:54,600
So again, we suspect there's a lot of
information there we don't know about.

159
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:58,110
So the big question really
with dolphin sounds,

160
00:09:58,111 --> 00:10:01,770
at least our an an all animal
communication for that matter.

161
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:05,670
Are The signals referential
meaning they refer to something,

162
00:10:05,671 --> 00:10:10,590
they label something like a name or
word for an object or are they graded?

163
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,750
Do the sounds run into each other?

164
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:17,280
Do they just do they just show things
like increasing intensity of sound?

165
00:10:17,281 --> 00:10:19,020
If I'm going to talk
really loud it really fast,

166
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:24,260
that would be kind of a graded system
versus a discreet word or referential

167
00:10:24,661 --> 00:10:28,200
signal. So this is one really big
debate in animal communication.

168
00:10:28,201 --> 00:10:31,980
And dolphins have both types of signals.
We know signature whistles, for example,

169
00:10:31,981 --> 00:10:34,260
their names are technically
a referential signal.

170
00:10:34,261 --> 00:10:36,870
They can call each other and they
can broadcast their own name.

171
00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:43,230
But it is at language and this is where
we really fall short in our tools to

172
00:10:43,231 --> 00:10:46,620
look at is there more complexity
in the order structure,

173
00:10:46,621 --> 00:10:50,430
potential grammar of their sounds.
Now,

174
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:55,020
Dolphin Communication has also a very
complicated for the researcher because

175
00:10:55,021 --> 00:10:57,660
they're really good at what
they do acoustically. Um,

176
00:10:58,530 --> 00:11:01,860
they have a pretty neat system for
creating sound and receiving sound.

177
00:11:01,861 --> 00:11:04,410
And probably the big message
here is they're very directional.

178
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:07,640
So they send out very high
frequency signals up to, uh,

179
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:11,130
it looks like 240 kilohertz,
high frequency out this way.

180
00:11:11,131 --> 00:11:15,270
Low frequencies drop off to the
side and they receive the sound, um,

181
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,520
through their lower jaw,
through a fatty Oregon.

182
00:11:17,521 --> 00:11:20,010
They don't have external ears like we do,
same thing.

183
00:11:20,011 --> 00:11:23,160
They receive sound directionally and uh,

184
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:25,380
to make it more complicated
for the researcher,

185
00:11:25,530 --> 00:11:28,950
if you want to get ahead on signal and
get the full high frequency that dolphins

186
00:11:28,951 --> 00:11:33,870
can internally steer their sound 20
degrees off and you would have no physical

187
00:11:33,871 --> 00:11:34,950
signal that they're doing that.

188
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:37,740
So it's a little challenging
to get ahead on signal.

189
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:41,400
So when you're trying to localize a
vocalize her and you see on the right side

190
00:11:41,401 --> 00:11:45,960
of the screen here a four hydrophone
array that helps us triangulate who's

191
00:11:45,961 --> 00:11:49,530
making sounds and this technology actually
we're just starting to incorporate

192
00:11:49,531 --> 00:11:50,970
with some new equipment.

193
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:55,450
So lots of times we don't even know
making the sound and these big groups.

194
00:11:55,480 --> 00:12:00,220
So very challenging for
the data. Um, again,

195
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,750
collecting ultrasounds has been
pretty recent, at least in our work.

196
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:07,420
On the lower left,
you see an example of the Spectrogram,

197
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:09,310
a little the whistle
that you've been hearing.

198
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:13,840
And the full picture is the
ultrasound above a hundred,

199
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:16,230
about 110 kilo hertz.
And uh,

200
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:19,720
hopefully you can see on the far right
there's some harmonics and I'll start

201
00:12:19,721 --> 00:12:21,050
showing up in this,
uh,

202
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:26,130
high frequency sound spectrogram you
see places where of course the clicks go

203
00:12:26,681 --> 00:12:30,700
broad band, we always knew that we just
didn't have the equipment to record it.

204
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:34,930
And you see some places
where the narrowband signal
wouldn't even be recognized.

205
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,550
There's no information in the narrow band,

206
00:12:36,551 --> 00:12:40,770
but there's information in the high band.
Now,

207
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:41,680
historically,

208
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:45,610
we've used a lot of different techniques
and whistles have been fairly well

209
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:49,540
studied primarily, and I hate to say it,
but they're easiest to measure, right?

210
00:12:49,541 --> 00:12:53,350
We can measure contours. We're pretty
good at visual pattern recognition.

211
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:57,010
Here you see examples of four signature
whistles from different dolphins and you

212
00:12:57,011 --> 00:12:58,150
can tell they're quite different.

213
00:12:58,151 --> 00:13:00,700
You can imagine the dolphins
can tell that as well,

214
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:05,410
and we can measure their basic parameters.
Um, early on we also use neural nets.

215
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:09,140
Uh, well if we had enough samples to
train the computer to tell us, um,

216
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:11,770
if two signature whistles
is red and the green,

217
00:13:11,771 --> 00:13:15,420
as you see are really different or
the same if the computer had problems

218
00:13:15,421 --> 00:13:17,920
separating them or not separating them.

219
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:21,960
And then it would give us a quantitative
index of how different they were. A,

220
00:13:21,961 --> 00:13:25,930
for example, between a mother and a calf
or two juveniles. So these are tools.

221
00:13:25,931 --> 00:13:29,590
We have used a very custom
kind of program tools.

222
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:34,360
Now these are signature
whistles from a mom and a calf.

223
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:35,560
Gemini is the mom

224
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,070
in a geo is her son?

225
00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:42,483
No.

226
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:47,620
And what we discovered when we were
doing our neural network is that some of

227
00:13:47,621 --> 00:13:48,970
these signals are very messy.

228
00:13:48,971 --> 00:13:52,240
They were just sloppy and we couldn't
track the contours of the whistle.

229
00:13:52,241 --> 00:13:55,060
So we had to throw them out of our
data sets for the neural network,

230
00:13:55,061 --> 00:13:59,170
which was not really okay because we
really want it to misery all the whistles

231
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:01,720
of all the mother, calf
pairs, that sort of thing. Um,

232
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:03,250
now with some of these new programs,

233
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:07,780
it'll actually extract these patterns
in a different way and allow us to code

234
00:14:07,781 --> 00:14:10,720
these signals. So neural nets
were great for a while. Um,

235
00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:12,070
they didn't get us very far.

236
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:16,390
So the process we really go through is
because we have underwater video and we

237
00:14:16,391 --> 00:14:19,120
have sound,
we use a program called observer,

238
00:14:19,121 --> 00:14:22,810
which is a behavioral coding software
for a bio behavioral biologists.

239
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:27,520
And we basically take a timeline
and we will code our body postures.

240
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:29,800
For example,
she might see a head to head,

241
00:14:29,801 --> 00:14:33,700
a little peck rubbing another
head to head, a courtship,

242
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:37,520
little courtship behavior, and
another, uh, reunion or peck peck.

243
00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:39,100
So we'll code that on a timeline.

244
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:42,880
And then simultaneously we'll take our
sounds and then you saw a little bit of

245
00:14:42,881 --> 00:14:46,960
this in the video and we'll walk through
our vocalizations and we'll code them

246
00:14:46,961 --> 00:14:51,560
in very generic terms. Um, so
here we might see a scream.

247
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:56,420
I'm here, we have a signature
whistle. Now we have a buzz,

248
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:59,900
and then we have some other really messy
kinds of sounds and we don't know how

249
00:14:59,901 --> 00:15:00,800
to categorize those.

250
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:05,980
So one of our main impetus for connecting
with dad's group was to really help us

251
00:15:06,831 --> 00:15:08,630
get at these categories of sound,

252
00:15:08,631 --> 00:15:13,550
specifically burst pulses
to help categorize things
that we human beings aren't

253
00:15:13,551 --> 00:15:15,500
very good at. Apparently. Again,

254
00:15:15,501 --> 00:15:19,070
match this with behavior and then look
for some structure in order to really

255
00:15:19,071 --> 00:15:22,640
take a look at, you know, are
there really any grammatical rules?

256
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:26,870
Those are structures, anything akin
to language. You're partially, uh,

257
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:29,300
akin to human phonemes,
for example.

258
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:33,890
So here are three spectrograms
tour humans and one is a dolphin.

259
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:37,160
Take a quick guests, which is,
which you guys are experts.

260
00:15:37,161 --> 00:15:40,400
I bet you're all going to get
this right. Um, so anyway, uh,

261
00:15:40,401 --> 00:15:43,580
the top one is,
is not a dolphin.

262
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:46,070
That's a human speaking
as is the bottom line.

263
00:15:46,071 --> 00:15:49,220
So the middle one are dolphin burst,
pulse sounds,

264
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:58,420
and you can see they look a little bit
like phonemes. We're not saying they are,

265
00:15:58,421 --> 00:16:02,020
but these are the structures were used
to sort of looking at and analyzing.

266
00:16:02,021 --> 00:16:06,280
Right? Um, I know my computer can
recognize my voice, but again,

267
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:10,030
he's a language we don't know. You know,
this is one way to start looking at it.

268
00:16:10,031 --> 00:16:13,330
It's not the only way because you still
have to understand the function meaning

269
00:16:13,331 --> 00:16:17,320
of words if they're there. But we
really want to take a look at it. Um,

270
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:21,640
now that we have some potential
tools. Um, so for example,

271
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:25,960
one thing that we started
with, with um, uh,

272
00:16:25,961 --> 00:16:30,190
the Georgia tech work was just
asking, is a whistle, just one unit?

273
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:34,150
That's the way we've always approached
it as dolphin researchers, but in fact,

274
00:16:34,151 --> 00:16:36,610
could that be parts of
whistles that are recombined?

275
00:16:36,611 --> 00:16:39,280
And of course this is critical if
you're looking at language, right?

276
00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:43,480
We recombine phonemes to make different
words in different orders. Um,

277
00:16:43,481 --> 00:16:46,440
so some of these tools are
being applied through Thad.

278
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:49,660
There's some dynamic time warping.
This been applied with other researchers.

279
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:52,540
But we're really pretty
excited about these tools.

280
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:55,660
I'm gonna let fed jump in here.
Talk about,

281
00:16:56,190 --> 00:16:58,380
so this is a tool called horror,

282
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:02,370
which is something we've made a Georgia
tech. This is a Daniel Close Doors,

283
00:17:02,371 --> 00:17:05,610
Phd dissertation. For those of
you who are into machine learning,

284
00:17:05,611 --> 00:17:09,410
you can go look it up at Georgia
Tech's dissertation database. Um,

285
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:14,100
in particular we have the
spectrogram up here. Um, we create a,

286
00:17:14,101 --> 00:17:16,440
we have about a 40
features here that were,

287
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:19,560
that are learned features as
being distinct in the database.

288
00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:23,130
I'm basically looking at convolutions
see what those features are in the,

289
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:25,290
in the spectrogram from those.

290
00:17:25,291 --> 00:17:28,260
We try to look for
repeating a time series,

291
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:31,350
these patterns here so you can get,

292
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:35,090
so you taken raw audio,
uh,

293
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:38,730
look for the areas that have a
dolphin vocalization in them,

294
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:43,410
try to find these features. And
then from those features, look at,

295
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:45,480
see how they recurrent
time and get a motif.

296
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:49,930
They look to see where all those motifs
are in time and make sure they look, uh,

297
00:17:49,931 --> 00:17:54,630
on the, uh, on the system from that.

298
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:55,660
We then,
you know,

299
00:17:55,660 --> 00:18:00,660
take this code book and try to explain
as much of the audio as we can.

300
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:06,950
So you're just trying to basically we
do such thing to a series of strings.

301
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:07,710
Um,

302
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:12,710
that data reduction really helps us move
much more quickly and trying to find a

303
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:17,350
repeated patterns. And from that, um,

304
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:19,410
from these repeating
motifs and labeling them,

305
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:22,740
we start finding things that it
turns out regular expressions.

306
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:26,640
So we just look at how
these things reoccur.

307
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:28,920
And to our surprise,

308
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:33,570
regular expressions turn out to be one
of those predictive things for behavior

309
00:18:33,571 --> 00:18:36,480
that we know that the niece
has observed in the wild.

310
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:40,830
So what we did is took her 2012 field
season, took the first half of it,

311
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:43,260
trained up a system.

312
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:46,650
So this is unsupervised learning where
we got the motifs and got the regular

313
00:18:46,651 --> 00:18:49,470
expressions and we tried bag him for
find the machine learning people.

314
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:51,360
Now for a second try bag of words,

315
00:18:51,361 --> 00:18:53,610
bag of grammars and bag
of regular expressions.

316
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:58,530
It turns out the most predictive thing
for the behaviors were bag of regular

317
00:18:58,531 --> 00:19:00,390
expressions.
Um,

318
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:05,340
and so what we looked at is took the
second half of her 2012 database. No,

319
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:08,250
and looked at the behavior she,
she tagged visually.

320
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:11,970
So she actually saw foraging behavior.
She actually saw aggression,

321
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:16,740
McCaffrey play. Given
that we then say, okay,

322
00:19:16,741 --> 00:19:20,370
what sort of motifs, what sort
of regular expressions, um,

323
00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:23,340
are affiliated with these
different types of visual behavior?

324
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:28,020
Can we actually see a correlation with
them acoustically? And the answer is yes.

325
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:32,430
And the correlation within class is
very high correlation across classes,

326
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:33,293
very low.

327
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:37,110
This is excellent news for us because
then now starts telling us that yes,

328
00:19:37,290 --> 00:19:41,670
there is some stuff here
that is discriminative in
the acoustic environment.

329
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:45,440
Now the question is how can
you do this on a bigger scale?

330
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:49,140
Doing this sort of stuff takes days
of computer power for a roughly small

331
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:49,993
dataset.

332
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,380
So, so these are bottlenose dolphins now
very coordinated and synchronizing the

333
00:19:54,381 --> 00:19:56,750
sounds.
And I'll let you disappeared for a second.

334
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:21,490
Two dyads and nail dolphins,
sea simply competing and you can hear,

335
00:20:21,491 --> 00:20:25,200
hear them supervising their
sounds and see them orient.

336
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:50,580
What are they saying? So, so,

337
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:55,720
so what we basically want the computer
to do is to help us automate categorizing

338
00:20:56,151 --> 00:21:00,200
and coding the sounds as the
video section you just saw.

339
00:21:00,201 --> 00:21:04,190
So we're not manually going through it
all the time and build a larger database.

340
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:09,710
So the system that we showed you before
from Dale causers dissertation is I said

341
00:21:09,871 --> 00:21:11,430
quite power hungry at thanks.

342
00:21:11,431 --> 00:21:14,820
A lot of computations taking living a
lot of the spectrogram at the same time.

343
00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:18,540
And so it's, it's something that, um, uh,

344
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:22,620
has some problems being paralyzed though
we can do it so they can kind of do a

345
00:21:22,621 --> 00:21:26,370
lot with bigger iron
out there. Um, but, uh,

346
00:21:26,371 --> 00:21:28,410
we're hoping now to make
some things a little faster.

347
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:32,010
So that's where we were showing you next.
So we'll let you again,

348
00:21:32,011 --> 00:21:33,240
unless you listen to this for a second.
Okay.

349
00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:37,500
You just spotted dolphins. Now
this is aggression, typical spot.

350
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:53,653
Okay.

351
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:58,570
And now this is a new tool where we're
actually doing something similar to this

352
00:21:58,571 --> 00:22:01,930
Shizam our algorithm for those who are
familiar with that were looking at the

353
00:22:01,931 --> 00:22:06,310
spectrogram as if it's a computer
vision problem, looking for regions, uh,

354
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:09,370
areas of interest. And they were starting
to looking at these patterns are time.

355
00:22:09,371 --> 00:22:10,930
Now the problem is it before,

356
00:22:10,931 --> 00:22:13,870
we are looking at sort of the distribution
of these things and how they change.

357
00:22:13,871 --> 00:22:17,460
Now we're looking for something very
simple, which is just, you know, the,

358
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:19,120
the main majority of
the regions of interest.

359
00:22:19,121 --> 00:22:21,430
Are they increasing in frequency
or decreasing your frequency?

360
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:24,850
And that's what this is down here.
And it turns out that's sufficient.

361
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:29,050
Josh Gad an initial, uh,
annotation of what's going on.

362
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:33,730
So you can see here that it's,
it's labeling the, the red
dots are the, the, the uh,

363
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:38,200
features. Um, this is
sort of the general, uh,

364
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:42,760
main feature. We're using the cluster on.
And you see at the top we have j, e, n, e,

365
00:22:42,761 --> 00:22:46,690
d, j, d, a, e, j, e, n, c layer.

366
00:22:46,691 --> 00:22:50,730
Later on you can see the,
the Ejv as a commander,

367
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:55,030
a combined thing. So the top is
basically the individual, um,

368
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:59,820
motifs, the ones that are combined
together. Those are the, uh,

369
00:22:59,830 --> 00:23:02,780
starting to be the regular
expressions were saying. And, uh,

370
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:05,230
this is brand new stuff.
This is just came out this month.

371
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:08,890
We're trying to get this so that the
niece can sit there and say, okay,

372
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:13,000
I'm going to load in this
database and in say minutes,

373
00:23:13,001 --> 00:23:15,820
as opposed to days,
get back some results,

374
00:23:15,821 --> 00:23:19,450
initial results and be able to figure
out where to throw more attention to more

375
00:23:19,451 --> 00:23:22,830
computational power on. Um, so, um,

376
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,120
hopefully we're going to continue develop
this and make it a little bit more

377
00:23:25,121 --> 00:23:29,710
sophisticated but allows her to really
tune the parameters a bit and see where

378
00:23:29,711 --> 00:23:32,230
our best bets are for a future work.

379
00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:34,980
Okay.

380
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:37,350
For example, if you're going
to hear a synchronize squad,

381
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:42,100
okay,

382
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:44,120
so these are adult dolphins.
Now you're going to hear juvenile,

383
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,190
you're trying to synchronize your squawks.

384
00:23:49,191 --> 00:23:52,760
This is something they learn over time
and we're hoping for example of these

385
00:23:52,761 --> 00:23:57,761
tools will help us pull out of our data
the specific categories in order of

386
00:23:57,981 --> 00:24:01,040
sounds so we can differentiate and
look at the process for example,

387
00:24:01,041 --> 00:24:04,520
of development of a vocal use in dolphins.

388
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:12,040
Now the second way we've been interfacing
is a researchers is to look at can we

389
00:24:13,521 --> 00:24:17,780
incorporate some underwater computer
technology real time to try to look at

390
00:24:17,781 --> 00:24:20,600
Dolphin communication?
And we asked the question,

391
00:24:20,601 --> 00:24:24,920
is it possible to directly real time
communicate with another species? Well,

392
00:24:24,921 --> 00:24:27,290
in The Bahamas we actually
have two species of dolphins.

393
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:31,040
Bottlenose dolphins you see here there
are about three feet larger than the

394
00:24:31,041 --> 00:24:35,700
spots and but they interact
on a regular basis. Um, they,

395
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:36,830
they forged together.

396
00:24:36,831 --> 00:24:41,100
Sometimes they babysit each other's
young interspecies babysitting. Um,

397
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:44,390
there's some dominance dynamics
between the males of both species,

398
00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:48,650
but they'll form temporary alliances
when we get another intruder in like a

399
00:24:48,651 --> 00:24:51,140
shark or a unknown bottlenose for example.

400
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:54,530
So they're are already communicating
with each other to a certain extent.

401
00:24:54,531 --> 00:24:57,740
We've been trying to look at that and
pick apart how much they understand

402
00:24:57,741 --> 00:25:00,080
perhaps of each other's
sounds and or behavior.

403
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:02,930
But if we look at the rest of nature,
um,

404
00:25:02,990 --> 00:25:05,450
other species are actually
decoding each other already.

405
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:07,130
We just aren't in that circle.

406
00:25:07,131 --> 00:25:11,360
So we have sent in a warning calls that
are used between species with birds and

407
00:25:11,361 --> 00:25:15,470
monkeys. Now with Cetaceans,
with whales and dolphins,

408
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:19,790
we have a couple interesting examples
where they're not just listening and

409
00:25:19,791 --> 00:25:22,880
taking advantage of knowing an
alarm call from another species.

410
00:25:23,090 --> 00:25:25,460
When they get together with each other,

411
00:25:25,461 --> 00:25:29,240
they actually create a short
and send a mutual language,

412
00:25:29,241 --> 00:25:30,740
but they use mutual signals.

413
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:35,920
So it appears to be easier at least for
whale and dolphin species to agree on

414
00:25:36,321 --> 00:25:39,800
some sounds they use when they're together
versus their own communication system,

415
00:25:39,801 --> 00:25:40,730
which is pretty interesting.

416
00:25:40,731 --> 00:25:43,400
I always thought maybe the way
to go is to just decode them.

417
00:25:43,670 --> 00:25:45,920
But if you're trying to
communicate with another species,

418
00:25:46,130 --> 00:25:49,880
maybe you have to spend the time and maybe
it's not culturally possible to learn

419
00:25:49,881 --> 00:25:54,620
the intricacies of, you know, a
nonhuman animal communication system.

420
00:25:55,010 --> 00:25:57,830
So that's kind of approach we're taking.
And uh,

421
00:25:57,860 --> 00:25:59,330
what started happening in The Bahamas,

422
00:25:59,331 --> 00:26:02,270
we work noninvasively and we try
to do behavioral observations,

423
00:26:02,271 --> 00:26:05,240
but the dolphins are often interacted
with us cause we're right in the water

424
00:26:05,241 --> 00:26:06,680
with them. We're close, we know them.

425
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:10,820
And they started doing things
like mimicking our postures,

426
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:16,250
goofy things like a gosh. One time
we had, I'll never forget this,

427
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:18,350
a swimmer who was trying to
do a dolphin kick, you know,

428
00:26:18,351 --> 00:26:22,190
the dolphin kick in the water and then
the dolphin was behind the swimmer going

429
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:27,020
just spazzing out because he
was not a good dolphin kicker.

430
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:31,160
So they have some funny sense of mimicry
cause that's what they do with each

431
00:26:31,161 --> 00:26:33,950
other all the time. And they sometimes
they would what I would call,

432
00:26:33,951 --> 00:26:37,160
tried to acoustically mimic us
too. And we kept thinking, God,

433
00:26:37,161 --> 00:26:39,050
maybe we should really create a tool.

434
00:26:39,051 --> 00:26:42,470
I mean it's a pretty unique situation
in the world. These dolphins have time,

435
00:26:42,650 --> 00:26:46,320
they're safe, they're pretty friendly
and they seem interested in humans.

436
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:48,720
Now we have plenty of other examples,

437
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:52,770
scientifically of interfaces that have
been created. What there's other species,

438
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:57,350
one of the best known of course as the
work with Kanzi by sue savage, Rumba, uh,

439
00:26:57,420 --> 00:27:02,070
who over many decades and many different
types of work designed a keyboard.

440
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:06,360
So Kanzi could interface and they could
go out in the woods and talk about

441
00:27:06,361 --> 00:27:10,350
things and share ideas and thoughts.
Uh, probably the most technical,

442
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:15,440
technically advanced a dolphin human
interface actually happened at the Epcot

443
00:27:15,690 --> 00:27:18,720
Center in Orlando, Florida. It
was actually an underwater, um,

444
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:23,230
a keyboard that was created. So Delvin's
and humans could both use it. Um,

445
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:26,520
you basically either stuck your hand
if you were human or you're a beak.

446
00:27:26,521 --> 00:27:30,330
If you were a dolphin into a hole,
which broken infrared beam,

447
00:27:30,331 --> 00:27:33,600
which triggered a word in
English or a whistle and Dolphin.

448
00:27:34,170 --> 00:27:37,790
And then the dolphin could go and say,
let's go to the reef and get a fish,

449
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:40,980
or the human could do that.
Um, but it turns out we humans,

450
00:27:40,981 --> 00:27:42,630
we're really slow in the water.

451
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:46,260
So the dolphins would make a command for
the humans and go over and they'd wait

452
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:47,970
and they'd wait for the
humans to get there.

453
00:27:48,570 --> 00:27:52,170
So part of the problem is they're so
fast acoustically and physically in the

454
00:27:52,171 --> 00:27:56,100
water, of course. Um, so they had pretty
good results, no big breakthroughs.

455
00:27:56,101 --> 00:27:57,960
But it was really the first example.

456
00:27:57,961 --> 00:28:01,290
And there've been historically other
people that have developed keyboards for

457
00:28:01,291 --> 00:28:06,240
dolphins. But this is the true, really
the first true underwater keyboard.

458
00:28:06,690 --> 00:28:11,220
So we kind of worked with them for a
while on our ideas and our original vision

459
00:28:11,221 --> 00:28:13,500
was while we're out there in
the boat, let's, you know,

460
00:28:13,530 --> 00:28:16,080
we have computers on the boat,
let's put a keyboard under the water,

461
00:28:16,081 --> 00:28:20,400
we'll have the diver work
with the dolphins, explore
the keyboard together. Um,

462
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:23,340
well we found out pretty quickly that
the dolphins have a lot better things to

463
00:28:23,341 --> 00:28:27,540
do in the wild and sit at the boat and
press the keyboard. Right? Fish goes by,

464
00:28:27,541 --> 00:28:31,590
they're out of there. So we, we
quickly created a portable keyboard.

465
00:28:31,591 --> 00:28:34,110
We get pushed through the water because
we're often swimming hard to keep up

466
00:28:34,111 --> 00:28:36,270
with them to see what they're doing.
Um,

467
00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:41,390
and it was a visual keyboard with a
little acoustic sound that was correlated

468
00:28:41,641 --> 00:28:46,260
with specific signal, the ship place.
So this is the whistle for scarf.

469
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:48,650
Okay.
Um,

470
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:53,850
so the idea was we labeled for simple
objects with whistles that they could

471
00:28:53,851 --> 00:28:56,400
mimic, but that were outside
of their normal repertoire.

472
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:59,460
Because we didn't want to say something
inappropriate because we didn't know

473
00:28:59,461 --> 00:29:02,730
their language.
Like your mother

474
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:09,210
does something with Blowfish, I dunno,
puffer fish. They do. Actually they,

475
00:29:09,211 --> 00:29:13,980
you know, they get high chewing and
puffer fish. Did you know that? They do.

476
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:17,850
Yeah. There were some great footage on
the Internet not too long ago that yeah,

477
00:29:17,851 --> 00:29:20,360
they pass around the puffer fish and
they have the, you know, the food,

478
00:29:20,410 --> 00:29:24,990
the drug from the liver of the puffer
fish. So, and in every animal has

479
00:29:26,670 --> 00:29:31,050
just enough to get high
thinks you'd never tell me I SRE,

480
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:35,640
I just thought of it. It's trying to make
a joke, but, so anyway, sorry about that.

481
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:39,420
So we labeled um, these
four objects, scarf, rope,

482
00:29:39,421 --> 00:29:42,160
things that we as humans bring in the
water they like to play with and drag

483
00:29:42,161 --> 00:29:46,090
around Sargassum which is a seaweed they
play around with. And then a bow ride,

484
00:29:46,091 --> 00:29:48,520
which is really high motivation
cause it like about rides.

485
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:52,880
So we had the system was pretty archaic.
This was in the late nineties. Um,

486
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:56,230
and they were interested but they couldn't
really trigger the system with their

487
00:29:56,231 --> 00:30:00,280
sound and, and, um, we couldn't do
any real time, sound recognition.

488
00:30:00,281 --> 00:30:03,640
So it was really not good enough.
So we said, oh, let's just wait.

489
00:30:03,641 --> 00:30:06,760
We'll find some computer
geniuses to help us out.

490
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:12,010
Fat actually came to my lab originally
to try to decode the dolphin natural

491
00:30:12,011 --> 00:30:14,000
sounds using some of his tools and yeah.

492
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:15,610
Then I made the mistake of saying,
oh,

493
00:30:15,611 --> 00:30:20,140
we can make your keyboard for you
only take a semester five years later.

494
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:25,620
Uh, we actually have a system
that we field. We're doing
this every summer now. Uh,

495
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:30,130
I, most modern one is a stereo. How tried
to kill her hurts a sampling system.

496
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:35,070
Uh, she can actually,
we can produce, um, uh,

497
00:30:35,110 --> 00:30:38,440
these whistles in the water.
We can also listen for them as well.

498
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:42,580
We're finding the stage where we have
gps and this thing that we can do a

499
00:30:42,581 --> 00:30:47,200
convolutional, uh, filters and start
picking up stuff at any frequency. The,

500
00:30:47,230 --> 00:30:50,820
they do it at a, one of the biggest
problems with this box actually is,

501
00:30:50,821 --> 00:30:52,180
is believe or not the speaker,

502
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:57,220
it turns out it's very hard to get
enough power in the water to actually

503
00:30:57,250 --> 00:31:00,660
communicate. Um, whenever you see
the navy do this, they have a,

504
00:31:00,661 --> 00:31:04,390
a hydrophone in the water with a big
amplifier hooked up to a big generator.

505
00:31:04,390 --> 00:31:05,860
Right?
And they're pushing toward Watson.

506
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:10,140
We can't exactly put 200 watts
into a chest mounted box. Um,

507
00:31:10,210 --> 00:31:14,170
so we've been making our
own custom speakers. Yes, I
am a speaker manufacturer.

508
00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:16,060
You don't want my speakers though,

509
00:31:16,061 --> 00:31:18,730
cause they really do not
have very good response,

510
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:22,360
but they're very good at certain, you
know, narrow bands and we can actually,

511
00:31:22,361 --> 00:31:23,610
you know, send out these things. I,

512
00:31:23,611 --> 00:31:26,890
while while the dolphins can
communicate it three miles, uh, we're,

513
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:30,550
we're sheet working on our signals
to be, to work at 60 feet. Um,

514
00:31:30,551 --> 00:31:31,870
so now we're actually successful.

515
00:31:31,871 --> 00:31:35,560
We can actually get these things in the
water with enough computational power,

516
00:31:35,730 --> 00:31:40,300
uh, enough, uh, sound
power to actually do these,

517
00:31:40,330 --> 00:31:43,330
do a two way communication work and I'll
let knees to tell you what we're trying

518
00:31:43,331 --> 00:31:44,164
to do with it.

519
00:31:44,530 --> 00:31:46,750
Yeah.
So the system basically as you see it,

520
00:31:46,751 --> 00:31:50,410
you know the box with a
computer to hydrophones to
receive the sound speakers to

521
00:31:50,411 --> 00:31:54,120
play the sound. And then the operator
has a key pad with the preprogrammed,

522
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:58,720
it sounds in it here you see pictures
of us getting our boxes on and go in the

523
00:31:58,721 --> 00:31:59,770
water.
Um,

524
00:31:59,771 --> 00:32:03,820
we actually practice in the water with
the boxes without the dolphins because we

525
00:32:03,821 --> 00:32:07,060
want to be ready for how they try to
mess us up when we're trying to do things

526
00:32:07,061 --> 00:32:09,610
with them. Um, and, and the whole,

527
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:13,660
the whole system here is designed on
modeling the communication system because

528
00:32:13,661 --> 00:32:17,710
the only thing that has worked
with other species primates,

529
00:32:17,730 --> 00:32:22,250
I mean pepper Pepperberg work with birds
is the idea that you want to show the a

530
00:32:22,270 --> 00:32:24,370
species how do use the system.

531
00:32:24,730 --> 00:32:28,060
It's like your kids are exposed to human
communication as they're growing up,

532
00:32:28,061 --> 00:32:32,140
right? They see you going
to the refrigerator for
milk, you talk about milk,

533
00:32:32,141 --> 00:32:32,974
you offered the mill.

534
00:32:33,310 --> 00:32:36,070
It's the same idea is that you don't want
to throw the species in there and go,

535
00:32:36,071 --> 00:32:39,590
okay, perform, do what
we want you to do. So if,

536
00:32:39,650 --> 00:32:43,280
if my colleague Adam wants to get
the scarf from me in the water,

537
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:45,620
he has to use his keyboard.
He has to ask for scarf,

538
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:50,760
has to come over and get it and then we
exchange it. So, so we practice that. Um,

539
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:52,790
we usually put a third
person in to be a dolphin.

540
00:32:52,791 --> 00:32:55,820
And try to mess us up and ask for things
we don't have and that sort of thing.

541
00:32:55,821 --> 00:32:59,100
And so we learn how to
respond appropriately. Um,

542
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:02,650
and then when the dolphins come around,
we have small timeframes.

543
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:06,860
I call them windows of opportunity where
they aren't doing their normal behavior,

544
00:33:06,861 --> 00:33:08,840
they're there to play,
they're ready to engage.

545
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:12,260
And we just try to tap into those moments.
And we can be in the water,

546
00:33:12,261 --> 00:33:13,070
I don't know,
an hour,

547
00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:16,700
two hours sometimes with them where
we're exchanging these toys and playing

548
00:33:16,701 --> 00:33:19,340
sounds and,
and having them see the system.

549
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:24,370
So the idea is diaper a and dive ruby
have a box on it with the computer diver a

550
00:33:24,371 --> 00:33:28,470
can play the scarf whistle so that diver
B is going to hear it as a word. Where,

551
00:33:28,471 --> 00:33:31,340
where are these um, uh,
bumped conducting earphones.

552
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:35,900
So diver be would hear it as a scarf.
The Dolphin would hear it as a whistle

553
00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:41,360
or diaper. Be Good, play a sound,
a sargassum whistle. Same thing.

554
00:33:41,361 --> 00:33:44,420
Diver a hears it as an English word,
so they're sure what went out.

555
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:46,700
The Dolphin would hear it as a different,
a whistle.

556
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:50,810
And then the hope is that the dolphins
will mimic the whistle and then dive or a,

557
00:33:50,811 --> 00:33:54,260
and diver B would be notified in
the earphone that, Ooh, you know,

558
00:33:54,350 --> 00:33:58,490
that whistle was made sargassum or scarf
and then the appropriate toi would be

559
00:33:58,491 --> 00:34:01,520
given to the dolphin and we'd swim off
into the sunset together playing with

560
00:34:01,521 --> 00:34:06,260
their toys. So it's a
simple system, but you know,

561
00:34:06,261 --> 00:34:08,870
dolphins can mimic sounds really well,

562
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:12,590
but to get them to understand the function
of a sound is a whole other level.

563
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:16,160
So it's all about exposure,
repeating the sound to them,

564
00:34:16,190 --> 00:34:19,700
showing them how it's used so that
they start, if they want the toy,

565
00:34:19,701 --> 00:34:24,080
they could ask us for
the toy. Um, for example,

566
00:34:24,081 --> 00:34:28,640
we also in the system, we have our own
signature whistles made. So we have names.

567
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,430
So I have a Denise whistle for example.
Um,

568
00:34:31,431 --> 00:34:34,850
we also have some of the dolphins names
in the computer because we have a very

569
00:34:34,851 --> 00:34:37,850
small subset of dolphins that
work with us on a regular basis.

570
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:41,090
So we have their signature whistles
in the computer. So if they come up,

571
00:34:41,091 --> 00:34:43,370
we can actually greet
them with their name,

572
00:34:43,371 --> 00:34:47,000
which is what they do with each other,
and then we can engage in this behavior.

573
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:50,130
So it's a potential tool.
This is actually something

574
00:34:50,220 --> 00:34:51,380
underwater.
Video of the word.

575
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:58,140
There's two people in the water,
both with boxes.

576
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:01,470
I've got the yellow scarf. They
can't hear you when the, yeah, sorry.

577
00:35:02,190 --> 00:35:03,390
I've got the yellow scarf.

578
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:10,530
Just labeled it for the dolphins.

579
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:26,740
I've just asked for the
star using a whistle. Got,

580
00:35:26,741 --> 00:35:29,330
then it gives me the scar.
Now I'm going to offer to the dolphins,

581
00:35:32,270 --> 00:35:33,900
I'm going to label it as I offer it.

582
00:35:46,290 --> 00:35:49,890
And then we try to get the scarf beck,
which we don't always,

583
00:35:50,370 --> 00:35:54,990
she loses a lot of scarves, but it's
interesting. Just last year, you know,

584
00:35:54,991 --> 00:35:58,200
we try to ask for the scarf back too,
and every once while they'll drop it.

585
00:35:58,201 --> 00:35:58,921
And so we're like,

586
00:35:58,921 --> 00:36:02,010
we're hopeful that there
may be understanding that
I've asked for the scarf,

587
00:36:02,011 --> 00:36:06,450
not sargassum or the rope,
et cetera. Um, so, uh,

588
00:36:06,451 --> 00:36:07,830
this year we're going to
have the new computers.

589
00:36:07,831 --> 00:36:12,831
And now the great thing about this next
summer is we finally have data for what

590
00:36:14,641 --> 00:36:16,920
the dolphins have been trying
to do with us. For example,

591
00:36:16,921 --> 00:36:21,180
they've been trying to mimic
these whistles in ways that
the computer wasn't set

592
00:36:21,181 --> 00:36:23,250
up to recognize.
For example,

593
00:36:23,251 --> 00:36:26,550
they will put little additions to our
whistle on it or they're doing some high

594
00:36:26,551 --> 00:36:29,610
frequency stuff, um, that the
computer's not recognizing,

595
00:36:29,611 --> 00:36:31,560
but now we're going to use that.

596
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:35,060
Dana, we were sampling it and did you
kill her as at first cause normally where

597
00:36:35,061 --> 00:36:37,580
between, you know, a a seven, 10,

598
00:36:37,970 --> 00:36:40,930
but it turns out that when
we went back and looked, um,

599
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:44,550
there was some evidence
of mimicry, um, uh,

600
00:36:44,750 --> 00:36:48,920
double the frequency and we just simply
didn't have a computer board fast enough

601
00:36:48,921 --> 00:36:49,754
to deal with it.

602
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:54,740
And it does not till this year that we
actually have a GPU based system where we

603
00:36:54,741 --> 00:36:59,090
can actually look for the same pattern
no matter what frequency and sad. So, um,

604
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:03,740
if they, we know that they can reduce
whistles, um, uh, much higher, uh,

605
00:37:03,750 --> 00:37:06,170
than we're looking at before. But now
we should be able to cover the whole,

606
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:07,370
the whole arrangement,
whistles,

607
00:37:07,371 --> 00:37:10,910
not the whole whole range of burst pulse
for the whole whole ranger whistles and

608
00:37:10,911 --> 00:37:12,350
be able to process that and time

609
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:14,340
and to know what they're
trying to do is really helpful.

610
00:37:14,341 --> 00:37:16,890
So now we can react more in human time.

611
00:37:17,130 --> 00:37:20,370
So the whole idea of this system is to
empower the dolphins to communicate with

612
00:37:20,371 --> 00:37:20,611
us,

613
00:37:20,611 --> 00:37:24,480
so we're not just giving them orders or
commands and to see how far it will go.

614
00:37:24,750 --> 00:37:28,890
And the hope is that with the decoding
software of their natural sounds,

615
00:37:28,891 --> 00:37:33,570
we can eventually figure
out some motifs or patterns.

616
00:37:33,571 --> 00:37:38,130
We can loop back into the two way system
and see if we can use more of their

617
00:37:38,131 --> 00:37:41,190
signals in the system.
Then our artificially created whistles.

618
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:48,090
So breaking the communication barrier of
humans and other animals, you know, it's,

619
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:51,810
it's a pretty interesting concept. We
haven't really tried it on a grand scale.

620
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:53,130
Can machine learning help?

621
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:58,050
I'm pretty convinced after working with
dolphins and the sounds for 30 plus

622
00:37:58,051 --> 00:37:59,640
years that you guys are,

623
00:37:59,641 --> 00:38:04,641
our only hope is that we really need these
power tools and we need the expertise

624
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:10,470
that you've all done in
your various fields for just
recognizing human speech in

625
00:38:10,471 --> 00:38:11,011
many ways.

626
00:38:11,011 --> 00:38:14,220
And I really think that's going to help
us really cracked the code with a lot of

627
00:38:14,221 --> 00:38:15,450
other animals,
not just dolphins,

628
00:38:15,451 --> 00:38:18,960
but the tools will really be
applicable I think across disciplines.

629
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:22,190
And that's one of the things
that, you know, those of
you who do machine learning,

630
00:38:22,191 --> 00:38:26,810
you know, part of the hardest part of the
problem is just getting good data sets.

631
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:29,060
We'll, Denise has three,
two years of it. Um,

632
00:38:29,061 --> 00:38:33,530
we're slowly getting it to the stage where
it's cleaned enough that that machine

633
00:38:33,531 --> 00:38:36,790
learning can really, um, uh,
techniques to really be used on it.

634
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:39,640
I'm really understanding it well
enough that we can, you know,

635
00:38:39,641 --> 00:38:43,300
figure out when this dolphin vocalization
when there's not. And, um, you know,

636
00:38:43,301 --> 00:38:46,450
we really think that these,
uh, these machine learning
techniques really can help.

637
00:38:46,451 --> 00:38:50,520
And we've done a first pass at which is
really showing some promise. However,

638
00:38:50,530 --> 00:38:52,840
when the big problems is simply resources,
right?

639
00:38:52,841 --> 00:38:57,841
We need more smart people to look at
this and look at this Dataset and um,

640
00:38:58,780 --> 00:39:03,610
uh, um, to, uh, take, uh,
um, to try different methods.

641
00:39:03,611 --> 00:39:06,950
So this is the method that we're using.
Those of you who are familiar with, uh,

642
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:11,800
the, um, machine learning approaches
here, it's sort of a different take on,

643
00:39:11,801 --> 00:39:15,090
on it. And so we're really
wanting to do is get some, get a,

644
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:19,540
a little team together and
see if we can, uh, get some,

645
00:39:19,630 --> 00:39:22,540
some progress here, um, in
the next couple of years.

646
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:26,100
Yeah. So we're trying to put
work in groups together. Um,

647
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:27,840
if you want to help
support our regular work,

648
00:39:27,930 --> 00:39:31,500
please go to our website while Dolphin
project and we have memberships,

649
00:39:31,501 --> 00:39:33,000
we have the chats society,

650
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:38,180
and there's also some small projects out
there at inner speech for those or you

651
00:39:38,181 --> 00:39:42,410
go to that conference. A
summit specializes on an animal
computer interaction. Um,

652
00:39:42,411 --> 00:39:45,260
this also an animal,
a computer interaction,

653
00:39:45,570 --> 00:39:49,940
a conference that's a now part of ACM,
a that has a yearly meeting.

654
00:39:50,130 --> 00:39:54,020
Uh, and so this now start to get
a small cadre of researchers.

655
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:58,550
They're not just looking at, um,
uh, marine mammals, but also, uh,

656
00:39:58,570 --> 00:40:01,190
birds and primates and
all sorts of animals.

657
00:40:01,191 --> 00:40:05,780
Seeing if we can come upon some common
tools and common methods to go forward

658
00:40:05,781 --> 00:40:09,200
and see if we really can crack
this code of what the key, the,

659
00:40:09,230 --> 00:40:13,730
these animals are doing with
their communication. Great.
So thank you very much.

660
00:40:13,790 --> 00:40:18,110
And uh, I'll run around with a microphone
and take any questions. Thank you.

661
00:40:23,230 --> 00:40:24,670
Thank you.
That was really interesting.

662
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:29,770
Do you have any idea what the dolphins
think of you? Are they there for play?

663
00:40:29,771 --> 00:40:33,700
Are they, what are they maybe trying
to communicate? Do you have any idea?

664
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:36,730
You know, they, it's,

665
00:40:36,731 --> 00:40:41,110
it's a really unique situation because
they have, I won't say an easy life,

666
00:40:41,111 --> 00:40:45,670
but they have a, a well-resourced life.
So they have, you know, they have fish,

667
00:40:45,671 --> 00:40:48,130
they don't have a lot of predators.
There's not a lot of human impact.

668
00:40:48,460 --> 00:40:50,770
So they have time to play with each other.

669
00:40:50,771 --> 00:40:55,270
And apparently humans when
we're there, um, you know,

670
00:40:55,271 --> 00:40:57,250
I don't know.
I don't know what they think of us.

671
00:40:57,251 --> 00:40:59,050
I think they think we're
funny in the water.

672
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:03,790
I think they think we provide bow rides
and some interesting entertainment.

673
00:41:03,791 --> 00:41:04,870
But you know, I, I,

674
00:41:04,910 --> 00:41:08,320
I really think it intelligence seeks
intelligence and I think they really

675
00:41:08,321 --> 00:41:12,510
recognize and other species of interests
like they do with the bottlenose we're

676
00:41:12,550 --> 00:41:15,270
out there and other species.
Um,

677
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:18,350
I think they make fun of
me. Well that's for sure. I,

678
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:20,080
I'm not a very strong swimmer.

679
00:41:21,190 --> 00:41:24,370
And so one day I was out there with a
niece and got some water. My master,

680
00:41:24,371 --> 00:41:28,060
I was doing mass clearing and we're just
floundering around and they all ignored

681
00:41:28,061 --> 00:41:31,100
her and came and just circled
me and just all did you know,

682
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:34,060
just all stood at the same way
I'm standing in, the water's

683
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:35,990
going, are you going, are
you dying? Can we watch

684
00:41:37,550 --> 00:41:40,040
suppressant and drag it back to the boat?
We've had to had them in health,

685
00:41:40,041 --> 00:41:41,630
like a struggling swimmer before,

686
00:41:41,770 --> 00:41:45,080
like escort them back to the boat because
they recognize that they definitely

687
00:41:45,090 --> 00:41:49,520
sense of play. Yeah. So we'll
see. I like to know. You're fine.

688
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:57,330
I want to thank you very
much for the wonderful talk,
a very interesting project.

689
00:41:57,900 --> 00:42:00,630
I have a question for you
and also questions with that.

690
00:42:00,631 --> 00:42:05,631
So you said your research does not require
attaching any physical things to the

691
00:42:08,591 --> 00:42:11,550
dolphin.
So when you acquire the data,

692
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:16,740
you are always at some close
proximity to the dolphins.

693
00:42:17,010 --> 00:42:22,010
So how do you know that the data
that you have is all they're saying?

694
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:26,190
Right. And also a
question to that, uh, the,

695
00:42:26,490 --> 00:42:31,420
the approach that you used to,
to cluster all of these, um,

696
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:34,140
rejects expressions.
Why don't you,

697
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:39,200
or maybe you have like one idea would
be to just run it on human voice and see

698
00:42:40,561 --> 00:42:45,450
whether it can find out patterns
in what people are saying. Um,

699
00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:49,880
yeah, sure. Thank you. So yeah, so we're
in the water, we're in close proximity.

700
00:42:49,881 --> 00:42:52,670
It's pretty hard to build a dolphin blind,
you know,

701
00:42:52,671 --> 00:42:56,900
and we've tried sticking a camera over a
boat and, you know, but we feel that if,

702
00:42:56,930 --> 00:43:00,830
if they're habituated to us and we're
not grabbing them and poking them,

703
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:03,500
they basically start behaving and
we try to record their behavior.

704
00:43:03,740 --> 00:43:08,510
Now it's most likely that we're not
recording everything they say. Absolutely.

705
00:43:08,810 --> 00:43:09,440
And,
uh,

706
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:13,460
we've toyed with doing things like putting
passive acoustic devices down on the

707
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:17,630
sea floor, which is only 20, 40 feet
deep just to record when we're not there,

708
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:20,900
of course, but they move around a lot.
So it's, that's a little challenging.

709
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:23,570
We've thought about
building some kind of drone.

710
00:43:23,571 --> 00:43:27,410
Like I'd love to do an underwater remora
that could attach to them and just go

711
00:43:27,411 --> 00:43:30,320
with them when we can't. And record
sounds. I mean, you could do that.

712
00:43:30,350 --> 00:43:35,000
You can do that kind of stuff now. Right.
Um, that'd be pretty cool. Um, so yeah, I,

713
00:43:35,020 --> 00:43:38,460
I'm sure there's things they're
saying that we haven't heard. And,

714
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:43,070
and the sound is directional too.
They can actually, uh, uh, select,

715
00:43:43,430 --> 00:43:47,570
uh, one person like, you
know, in this audience and the
other people can't hear it,

716
00:43:47,930 --> 00:43:51,410
so they can be very directional with
their high frequency stuff. So yes,

717
00:43:51,411 --> 00:43:55,160
we're missing stuff. We know
we're missing stuff. Um, uh,

718
00:43:55,190 --> 00:43:59,380
hopefully this two way
work, um, you know, you,

719
00:43:59,430 --> 00:44:00,970
you could hear him in the water too,
right?

720
00:44:01,580 --> 00:44:04,670
Because you get a lower frequency stuff
so you kind of know when they're aiming

721
00:44:04,671 --> 00:44:09,580
at Ya. Um, but uh, yeah,
uh, it's a problem. Um,

722
00:44:09,650 --> 00:44:14,570
we just hoping to get enough data
that, uh, we can deal with that issue.

723
00:44:14,630 --> 00:44:17,000
Now as far as, you know, running
it on humans, human language,

724
00:44:17,001 --> 00:44:20,960
we have for I know sign language actually
and a data set that I made as part of

725
00:44:20,961 --> 00:44:24,850
my master's thesis back
in the mid nineties and a,

726
00:44:24,860 --> 00:44:28,940
it actually finds half those signs
right from the, from the video features.

727
00:44:29,330 --> 00:44:33,990
Um, I've done more recently with a connect
data for sign language does the same

728
00:44:33,991 --> 00:44:37,200
thing. We're doing it on
synthesize synthetic speech. Um,

729
00:44:37,201 --> 00:44:42,000
we're doing it on a MIT's opencourseware
lectures. Uh, the timid Dataset,

730
00:44:42,090 --> 00:44:43,750
a OCR,
um,

731
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:47,200
lot of things where we know what the
answer is and performs really well. Uh,

732
00:44:47,220 --> 00:44:50,940
we have an exercise database to where
it's just exercise routines and it and it

733
00:44:50,941 --> 00:44:55,840
discovers all six of the exercises and
the I'll make recognizes get nicer person

734
00:44:55,870 --> 00:45:00,840
accuracy. So the algorithms
are, are you know, doing stuff,

735
00:45:00,870 --> 00:45:04,620
doing well on these well
constrained problems.

736
00:45:04,890 --> 00:45:06,270
But this is the aspirational,

737
00:45:06,271 --> 00:45:09,330
where can we actually make it work on
something we don't know the answer to.

738
00:45:09,630 --> 00:45:10,620
It can work well enough.

739
00:45:10,621 --> 00:45:14,490
We can get help Denise get somewhere on
the state of set cause we don't have to

740
00:45:14,491 --> 00:45:16,290
be perfect.
We don't even have to be that good.

741
00:45:16,650 --> 00:45:19,830
We used to have to accelerate what
she's doing. That's are a hard thing.

742
00:45:22,580 --> 00:45:27,580
So if I understood the correlation that
was being done between alphabets and

743
00:45:27,711 --> 00:45:30,140
patterns or features being extracted,
right.

744
00:45:30,141 --> 00:45:34,580
So it sounded like we were trying
to take the English approach,

745
00:45:34,610 --> 00:45:39,470
the English language approach and
equate pieces of sounds to alphabet.

746
00:45:39,950 --> 00:45:44,950
I'm wondering whether there's any room
to take the Chinese language philosophy

747
00:45:45,441 --> 00:45:50,000
and take a character to a whole phrase
or a meaning or a sentence. Right.

748
00:45:50,650 --> 00:45:54,900
And, and, and use that,
especially when it comes to, um,

749
00:45:56,390 --> 00:45:58,610
it could,
could there be portions of the language,

750
00:45:58,611 --> 00:46:00,980
and this is part of the second
question that are actually singing.

751
00:46:01,010 --> 00:46:04,790
Nothing to do with communication,
just plain singing, going,

752
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:08,300
um, comfort noises, things like that.

753
00:46:08,570 --> 00:46:11,240
Or just singing in rhythmic
dawn's hypnotic tons, right?

754
00:46:11,450 --> 00:46:15,500
Yeah. That's a second question. Oh,
so there's, there's a lot of, um,

755
00:46:16,220 --> 00:46:20,450
hopefully you'll get this, this
algorithm. We get some of that, uh, both,

756
00:46:20,510 --> 00:46:22,970
both issues and there's a
lot of work on Zebra finch,

757
00:46:22,971 --> 00:46:27,170
that sort of thing as far as, you know,
just bird song and, uh, we can get,

758
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:29,870
when we're doing,
I'm a human speech,

759
00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:34,010
we get things like coughs and sneezes and,
and uh,

760
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:37,720
just a microphone against
that person's lapel. Um,

761
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:40,310
and a lot of that stuff is actually useful
because he can get rid of the noise.

762
00:46:40,311 --> 00:46:42,370
You characterize the types of
noise and get rid of it. Right.

763
00:46:42,460 --> 00:46:46,220
And there's anybody to speech recognition.
It tells you that's important. Um,

764
00:46:46,250 --> 00:46:51,170
now as far as you know, how much of
these individual units mean, um, is it,

765
00:46:51,410 --> 00:46:54,860
is it a composition or is it
wholly on their own? Don't know

766
00:46:56,570 --> 00:46:57,740
regarding that whistle question.

767
00:46:57,830 --> 00:47:01,280
So your question about is it Chinese
mandarin where you have the different

768
00:47:01,281 --> 00:47:03,380
inflections of the tunnel?
Right?

769
00:47:03,830 --> 00:47:07,220
So that would be something that the
system could pick up as far as if it was a

770
00:47:07,221 --> 00:47:11,870
combination, you know, the tail end went
up, it went down, etc. Now, decades ago,

771
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:15,950
people thought about this issue and they
looked at whistle languages in humans,

772
00:47:16,370 --> 00:47:18,320
in the mountainous areas,
for example, Pyrenees.

773
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:22,640
And I'm just a few other areas in the
world to look at how much content goes

774
00:47:22,641 --> 00:47:26,570
between those mountains when one guy is
whistling to another and coming home.

775
00:47:26,571 --> 00:47:30,130
So some of it ended up being
contextual. Like they, it was Joe over

776
00:47:30,130 --> 00:47:33,000
here and Fred was whistling
and they knew it was mealtime,

777
00:47:33,010 --> 00:47:35,500
so he was probably gonna go
get some bread and you know,

778
00:47:35,590 --> 00:47:39,730
get some food for dinner, whatever.
But, um, that has been speculated on,

779
00:47:39,731 --> 00:47:44,731
but that the part of the trick here is
that whistles are a really small part of

780
00:47:44,741 --> 00:47:47,110
their communication and
these other kinds of sounds,

781
00:47:47,111 --> 00:47:48,820
which are the really
hard ones to categorize.

782
00:47:48,821 --> 00:47:51,790
The burst pulses that are
more like phonemes really,

783
00:47:52,300 --> 00:47:56,650
they are the ones that
we were really lacking an
understanding of their function,

784
00:47:56,710 --> 00:47:58,960
their categories and all that.

785
00:47:58,961 --> 00:48:02,680
So that's part of why we started because
people have really gone through the

786
00:48:02,681 --> 00:48:03,540
whistle stuff a lot.

787
00:48:03,820 --> 00:48:06,760
Historically,
logic helps work on parade dogs.

788
00:48:07,150 --> 00:48:11,590
It's really quite astonishing in 200
milliseconds. Point two seconds, right?

789
00:48:12,070 --> 00:48:16,630
These, uh, uh, pray dogs are our
encoding. What type of Predator is there?

790
00:48:17,020 --> 00:48:20,440
So you can actually, you can actually
watch this yourself. Um, if it's a hawk,

791
00:48:20,590 --> 00:48:23,590
right? And they get along well, I
call everybody goes into the borough.

792
00:48:23,980 --> 00:48:27,160
If it's a snake, they'll sit there and
stand and stand up and look at it. Right?

793
00:48:27,430 --> 00:48:31,600
And so conn has shown that they can
encode in this in this 0.2 seconds,

794
00:48:32,020 --> 00:48:36,880
the shape and size of the object
that's impinging upon their territory.

795
00:48:37,510 --> 00:48:38,800
Right? Uh, so,

796
00:48:38,860 --> 00:48:42,070
so if these prairie dogs can they do
this and this is higher harmonics,

797
00:48:42,340 --> 00:48:46,600
if these prairie dogs can do it right,
what can these dolphins do?

798
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:49,200
And so one of the things
we've been looking at is, uh,

799
00:48:49,330 --> 00:48:52,600
one of the grand proposal we put together
is trying to take all the stuff that

800
00:48:52,601 --> 00:48:55,540
you painfully put together over 20 years.

801
00:48:55,540 --> 00:48:57,640
All these experiments and
all this data is collected.

802
00:48:57,940 --> 00:49:01,000
Can you actually take a look at his data
where we know what the answer is and

803
00:49:01,001 --> 00:49:04,270
rediscover it using our techniques?
Um, we haven't gone there yet.

804
00:49:04,271 --> 00:49:08,590
That was part of a grant proposals being
being evaluated right now. But, um,

805
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:13,510
uh, we're hoping to, to not
only just do Denise's work,

806
00:49:13,870 --> 00:49:15,690
but a lot of these other,
uh,

807
00:49:15,790 --> 00:49:19,480
animal vocalizations specialists see if
I can get their databases and see if we

808
00:49:19,481 --> 00:49:21,190
can accelerate stuff for them.

809
00:49:21,191 --> 00:49:24,910
And for the ones we know the answers to
see if we can see if it actually pulls

810
00:49:24,911 --> 00:49:25,744
them out as well.

811
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:31,160
You mentioned in the dauphine diary that
very occasionally orthodontics spottier

812
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:35,540
dauphine lots to babysit the cuffs.

813
00:49:35,900 --> 00:49:38,510
You also mentioned it's
not really a great idea.

814
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:41,880
I don't know that they will give us the,
yeah.

815
00:49:42,170 --> 00:49:47,170
So I don't know if like any incident has
happened and like why do you print it?

816
00:49:48,220 --> 00:49:48,810
Do you,

817
00:49:48,810 --> 00:49:52,650
so shark attacking diocese,
what he's referring to is, um,

818
00:49:53,180 --> 00:49:56,360
we described,
I described in my book how,

819
00:49:56,420 --> 00:49:59,000
cause we know that I've grown
up with a lot of these dolphins,

820
00:49:59,001 --> 00:50:00,080
other grandmothers now,

821
00:50:00,081 --> 00:50:02,840
but I knew them when they were born and
I know their grandkids and all that.

822
00:50:03,230 --> 00:50:05,210
And so occasionally,

823
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:10,340
occasionally they'll come to the boat
or will be anchored and we'll be in the

824
00:50:10,341 --> 00:50:10,880
water where the,

825
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:14,960
and the moms will leave their calves
with us and they'll take off. I like got,

826
00:50:16,430 --> 00:50:18,850
that might not be a very smart
thing to do, but they figured, well,

827
00:50:18,860 --> 00:50:21,560
I got to go forward. So take
care of junior for a while.
We're like, yeah, right.

828
00:50:21,561 --> 00:50:22,830
We're going to, what are
we going to do? You know,

829
00:50:22,831 --> 00:50:26,990
if a shark shows up as a walking.
But um, I mean they don't go far.

830
00:50:27,140 --> 00:50:30,770
It's not like if the calf made a noise,
they wouldn't come swimming and running.

831
00:50:30,771 --> 00:50:32,670
You know, but, uh, yeah, it's,

832
00:50:32,870 --> 00:50:36,860
what I find interesting about that
is that it's kind of like they are

833
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:41,660
incorporating you in their society and
they're smart enough to not put their

834
00:50:41,661 --> 00:50:46,190
calf in danger or at least
I hope so because I wouldn't
be very survival driven.

835
00:50:46,530 --> 00:50:49,720
Um, but it is interesting and
that, that's why, you know,

836
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,810
I think the link is there to really
go further. It's just said, you know,

837
00:50:53,811 --> 00:50:54,830
we have to meet them.

838
00:50:54,860 --> 00:50:57,830
We have to bridge the gap with her
technology I think is the trip.

839
00:50:58,780 --> 00:51:03,540
I'm wondering like, since being observing
golfing's for such a long time, um,

840
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:07,250
do you observe sound
like young doffing um,

841
00:51:07,450 --> 00:51:12,160
like ball without such a full
pattern of doffing for Kevin Murray?

842
00:51:12,370 --> 00:51:15,440
Then gradually they kind of learned this,
um,

843
00:51:16,420 --> 00:51:17,253
you know,
uh,

844
00:51:17,530 --> 00:51:22,530
the watching young dolphins develop has
actually been one of the biggest things

845
00:51:23,291 --> 00:51:25,750
for our work because when I
first went out there, you know,

846
00:51:25,751 --> 00:51:29,320
I'd see the adults fighting or the adults
meeting. And so you get a sense of, oh,

847
00:51:29,321 --> 00:51:32,560
that's what they do. And that's the
ritual. But when you see the little guys,

848
00:51:32,561 --> 00:51:34,990
they're trying and they're fumbling and
they're learning and they're getting

849
00:51:34,991 --> 00:51:39,700
feedback from their cohort. So yeah,
absolutely. They're learning social rules.

850
00:51:39,730 --> 00:51:43,210
They're learning sound restrictions,
I'm sure when, when to make sound,

851
00:51:43,211 --> 00:51:47,110
when to not like we've had a couple
young calves that were real squeakers,

852
00:51:47,111 --> 00:51:49,270
we'd hear them coming from miles away,
you know,

853
00:51:49,271 --> 00:51:52,810
and we could tell who it was a little
freedom. They'd be like, shut up.

854
00:51:52,811 --> 00:51:56,140
You're shark bait. Stop it.
You know. And sure enough,

855
00:51:56,470 --> 00:51:59,740
two months later she shows up with a big
chunk out of her fluke, someone bitter.

856
00:51:59,740 --> 00:52:03,160
And then it happened again. And
it's like, come on, it's quiet down.

857
00:52:03,161 --> 00:52:07,270
And finally her mom, I guess convinced
her to shut up and not be so vocal.

858
00:52:07,570 --> 00:52:07,991
But yeah,

859
00:52:07,991 --> 00:52:11,320
they absolutely go through the learning
process and they don't always learn

860
00:52:11,321 --> 00:52:15,100
sufficiently and they do die and get in
trouble of course. But yeah, absolutely.

861
00:52:15,101 --> 00:52:15,934
And,
um,

862
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:20,780
other researchers have taken a dolphin
vocalization databases and apply

863
00:52:20,781 --> 00:52:23,530
information theory to them and looked at,

864
00:52:23,531 --> 00:52:26,980
do little dolphins babble
like little human kids do,

865
00:52:26,981 --> 00:52:29,650
and then gradually refine their sounds.
And it in fact they do.

866
00:52:29,940 --> 00:52:34,120
The information is constrained and given
feedback. And so, yeah, absolutely.

867
00:52:34,121 --> 00:52:34,954
It's a process.

868
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:39,520
I'm just wondering if you have any sense
of the upper limit of the frequency

869
00:52:39,521 --> 00:52:40,780
dolphins are able to hear it.

870
00:52:40,930 --> 00:52:45,930
And also are there any differences in
the way a dolphin might here relative to

871
00:52:46,540 --> 00:52:48,490
how a human hears and do you capture that?

872
00:52:49,480 --> 00:52:54,480
So dolphins have been tested at least
some species and had audiograms made and

873
00:52:54,821 --> 00:52:59,380
it looks like they're hearing has a
couple of different sensitivity peaks.

874
00:52:59,410 --> 00:53:03,040
So they hear best around
30 to 40 kilohertz and then
they have another bi-modal

875
00:53:03,041 --> 00:53:06,100
peak at about a hundred
120 kilo kilohertz. Now,

876
00:53:06,101 --> 00:53:09,070
researchers haven't measured much higher
than that because it looks like it

877
00:53:09,071 --> 00:53:13,300
drops around 120 but on the
recording side, just recently,

878
00:53:13,301 --> 00:53:18,130
last few years, um, people have recorded
sounds up until about 240 kilohertz.

879
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:22,690
So for some reason they're making sounds
higher than we think they can hear.

880
00:53:23,140 --> 00:53:26,730
So quite sick question mark. Um, and yeah,

881
00:53:26,731 --> 00:53:29,550
of course their ears are completely
different. They had mammalian ears,

882
00:53:29,551 --> 00:53:32,760
they have certain specializations. Of
course, a lot of high frequency, you know,

883
00:53:32,790 --> 00:53:37,740
inner hair cells and a lot of turns
in the Cochlea and stuff. Um, yeah,

884
00:53:37,741 --> 00:53:41,010
so there are adapted to their
environment. Certainly. Um,

885
00:53:42,300 --> 00:53:47,100
they can produce really loud
sounds like 180 decibels,

886
00:53:47,130 --> 00:53:50,550
220 decibels, which underwaters
like a blasting cap, you know,

887
00:53:50,551 --> 00:53:52,740
it's a lot of energy because
of the medium. Right.

888
00:53:53,130 --> 00:53:54,750
And they do crazy things with her sounds,

889
00:53:54,751 --> 00:53:59,751
which I could get into in some crazy
deal till like they can phase out signals

890
00:53:59,820 --> 00:54:02,400
to block, you know, certain
parts of the bandwidth.

891
00:54:02,401 --> 00:54:04,830
So there's some pretty
complicated stuff going on there,

892
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:09,480
which are just starting to get at,
we're seeing some crazy stuff at work.

893
00:54:09,910 --> 00:54:13,350
Yeah. We don't understand yet. I was like,
you know, was that intentional or not?

894
00:54:13,351 --> 00:54:14,100
Cause it's really,

895
00:54:14,100 --> 00:54:16,670
really on the stuff they're doing
acoustically is really wacky.
