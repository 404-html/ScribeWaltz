1
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:09,330
Welcome everyone.

2
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:14,160
Today we have such an important topic
talking about lymphatic diseases and

3
00:00:14,161 --> 00:00:18,990
lymphedema for me personally
today is incredibly important.

4
00:00:18,991 --> 00:00:23,430
I'm the chief medical officer at verily
and fairly is the branch of alphabet

5
00:00:23,431 --> 00:00:27,480
that focuses on healthcare and
life science, but across alphabet,

6
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:30,900
our appreciation of both health
and disease continues to grow.

7
00:00:30,901 --> 00:00:32,760
So I think all of you
for being here today,

8
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:38,080
the other piece is as a cardiologist and
having the ability to work with docs or

9
00:00:38,081 --> 00:00:41,580
rocks and, and the crew you're going
to see today has been a real pleasure.

10
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:45,660
I think all of us will walk away with
more knowledge and more compassion.

11
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:51,000
So I'll introduce our guests and then
and then turn it over to them for a

12
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:54,120
conversation. One thing I will notice,
we will take questions at the end.

13
00:00:54,121 --> 00:00:56,190
So please think along the way,
uh,

14
00:00:56,191 --> 00:01:00,460
of your questions and we certainly welcome
them. So to my left, we have a doctor,

15
00:01:00,461 --> 00:01:01,320
Stan,
Roxanne,

16
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:05,880
cardiologist to professor at Stanford and
you will learn and hear about his true

17
00:01:05,881 --> 00:01:08,880
passion, uh, for the disease
we're talking about today.

18
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:14,660
We also have Kathy Bates who needs no
introduction to a academy award winning

19
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:18,600
actress,
a director and a philanthropist.

20
00:01:18,601 --> 00:01:23,601
And I think her role in champion
lymphatic disease has been remarkable.

21
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:29,210
And we have bill rich CP who since 2011
has been the president and CEO of a

22
00:01:29,791 --> 00:01:34,791
group called learn and learn has been
focusing on individuals who have lymphatic

23
00:01:35,041 --> 00:01:36,300
disease and lymph edema.

24
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:41,190
I should also note that he spent 35 years
in place himself, so maybe he'll uh,

25
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:45,180
he'll provide some color there as well.
So thanks again.

26
00:01:45,181 --> 00:01:49,890
I'll now turn it over to Stan to tell
us a little bit about what we're talking

27
00:01:49,891 --> 00:01:53,310
about when we think about this,
this set of conditions, the

28
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:58,140
issue that we're going to talk about
is a very important part of the

29
00:01:58,141 --> 00:01:59,040
circulation.

30
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:04,580
One that is commonly not recognized
because it's working in the background.

31
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:10,670
And the problem is that medical doctors
don't know much about it either.

32
00:02:11,281 --> 00:02:15,210
They should, but they don't.
As I mentioned in 2007,

33
00:02:15,211 --> 00:02:20,211
I did a study of the 110 medical schools
in North America to find out exactly

34
00:02:21,601 --> 00:02:23,640
how much time is spent on the system.

35
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:27,630
And in a four year medical education
we learned about 15 minutes.

36
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:30,720
If you're lucky and go to a really
good medical school, 30 minutes.

37
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:33,700
I did bring something for show and tell,
uh,

38
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:35,970
just to show you how ludicrous that is.

39
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:40,730
This is a textbook on lymphedema
that we just re edited. Uh,

40
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:44,550
this is what a well trained
clinician should know.

41
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:49,380
It's a thousand pages. There's no
way you can cover this in 15 minutes.

42
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:52,350
We can't cover it in five minutes,
which is what I've been allotted.

43
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:57,240
But let me give you just a little bit of
background. Uh, so the lymphatic system,

44
00:02:57,241 --> 00:02:59,710
I'm going to use the
metaphor of a brick wall.

45
00:02:59,711 --> 00:03:02,890
If I ask all of you to imagine
a brick wall and then a mat,

46
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:05,530
and then describe to me
what you are looking at.

47
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:10,000
You're likely to tell me something about
rectangular shaped objects that are

48
00:03:10,001 --> 00:03:13,510
overlapping, stacked on one
another, a maroon color.

49
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:18,690
And I bet almost nobody will tell me about
the white mortar that sits around the

50
00:03:19,031 --> 00:03:23,490
bricks. And yet we know without the
mortar you don't have a brick wall,

51
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,910
you have a pile of bricks.

52
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:29,020
The white mortar in the body
is the lymphatic system.

53
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:34,250
It is the part of the circulation that
ensures that the local pond in which

54
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:39,640
every cell operates,
has the right constituency,

55
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:41,200
has the right volume,

56
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:46,350
and is able to support the health of
those cells and the lymphatic circulation

57
00:03:47,051 --> 00:03:52,051
passes through lymph nodes and the lymph
nodes help all parts of the body to

58
00:03:52,271 --> 00:03:56,050
communicate to the immune
system when there is a threat,

59
00:03:56,230 --> 00:04:01,210
whether it is a toxin or a bacteria
or a virus or anything that the immune

60
00:04:01,211 --> 00:04:05,200
system needs to respond to.
So without this vital system,

61
00:04:05,201 --> 00:04:08,830
without the mortar,
everything will collapse.

62
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,990
The disease that we're talking about
today, the common lymphatic disease,

63
00:04:13,991 --> 00:04:17,650
not the only one,
but the most common one is lymphedema,

64
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:22,920
which is basically when the wall collapses
in a part of the body because that

65
00:04:23,471 --> 00:04:28,471
part of the body is not functioning
with normal lymphatic constituency.

66
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:34,170
And basically we understand a lot
about why that condition arises.

67
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:40,210
We understand who's at risk for it and
we have treatments for it, but the,

68
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:45,480
the obstacle that we face is that medical
practitioners are simply not aware.

69
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:50,170
Let me tell you just a few of the
contexts in which we see lymphedema.

70
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:53,860
We talk about secondary
and primary lymph edema.

71
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:57,610
Secondary lymphedema
means that you're born,

72
00:04:57,790 --> 00:04:59,470
your lymphatic system is normal,

73
00:04:59,471 --> 00:05:04,471
everything is operating well and something
injures the system and you develop

74
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:10,680
this swelling problem and this immune
malfunction in a part of your body that is

75
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:13,030
secondary lymphedema.

76
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:17,230
And the most common cause in the United
States is being treated for cancer.

77
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:21,790
Because when doctors treat cancer,
they remove lymph nodes from the body,

78
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:26,650
they irradiate lymph nodes and they
damage the system in a way that renders it

79
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:30,100
unable to function properly.
In the world at large,

80
00:05:30,101 --> 00:05:34,960
and we're talking about 90 million
people, it is filariasis, which is a,

81
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:36,400
an infectious problem.

82
00:05:36,401 --> 00:05:41,080
It's a parasite that attacks the lymph
nodes and destroys them and causes a very

83
00:05:41,081 --> 00:05:45,910
severe form of lymphoma called
elephantiasis. Here in the United States,

84
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:51,070
probably five to 10 million
Americans have this problem.

85
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:55,420
Difficult to know because doctors aren't
writing the diagnosis down and if they

86
00:05:55,421 --> 00:05:57,860
don't enumerate it,
we can't enumerate it.

87
00:05:57,861 --> 00:06:00,980
But by projection and
by oblique references,

88
00:06:00,981 --> 00:06:04,480
we think that that's a fairly
valid number. In that fiber.

89
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:06,080
10 million cases,

90
00:06:06,081 --> 00:06:11,081
there are perhaps 2% of those who are
born with genetic causes of lymphedema.

91
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:17,000
That is the lymphatic system
is malformed or it is,

92
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:22,030
it is functionally incompetent because
of the genetic makeup of the individual.

93
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:26,480
Now, don't mistake inborn
problems with congenital.

94
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:30,050
Some lymphedema that is
primary is congenital,

95
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:32,540
but some appears in the teenage years.

96
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:37,720
Some appears in young adulthood and many
cases appear after the age of 35 even

97
00:06:37,851 --> 00:06:42,851
though the defect is present in the
blueprint of the body from birth.

98
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:47,480
So those are the broad categories,
um, that we're talking about.

99
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:48,800
Now,

100
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:53,800
just to show you how ludicrous the problem
is that we face in medical education

101
00:06:54,531 --> 00:06:57,380
and medical practice.
I recently saw a patient,

102
00:06:57,590 --> 00:07:00,830
a woman who has pretty severe lymph edema,

103
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:05,390
swelling and deformity of her limbs,
both lower extremities,

104
00:07:05,391 --> 00:07:10,190
both legs. She was treated for colon
cancer. She had lymph nodes removed,

105
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:15,220
she had radiation therapy
and for approximately a
year and a half during which

106
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,400
time her legs were getting
progressively more enlarged.

107
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:24,290
None of the doctors would acknowledge
that she had a problem and nobody

108
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:25,520
certainly gave it a name.

109
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:30,850
Eventually through back channels and
talking to people and other individuals in

110
00:07:30,981 --> 00:07:35,900
the community, she learned
the name lymphedema. She
went to her doctor and said,

111
00:07:35,901 --> 00:07:40,370
I think I know what this is. This is
lymphedema. The doctor said, oh no.

112
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,250
That only happens in the arms
to breast cancer patients.

113
00:07:43,251 --> 00:07:46,370
It doesn't happen in the legs.
Preposterous.

114
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:51,790
Not even in that 15 minutes did this
physician learn that this can happen

115
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:56,090
anywhere in the body because the
lymphatic circulation is everywhere.

116
00:07:56,810 --> 00:08:00,200
Now Jessica said that she's a
cardiologist. I'm a cardiologist.

117
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:05,470
I got interested in this field because
I'm interested in understanding how the

118
00:08:05,541 --> 00:08:09,650
circulation maintains its integrity
and when I went through my training,

119
00:08:09,651 --> 00:08:14,000
I can readily admit I didn't know
anything about lymphedema until I chose to

120
00:08:14,001 --> 00:08:18,860
embrace the lymphatic circulation as an
entity for research and clinical care,

121
00:08:18,861 --> 00:08:23,510
but I think it's vital. It is vital, not
only that cardiologists know about it,

122
00:08:23,511 --> 00:08:27,620
but basically every physician who
purports to take care of patients.

123
00:08:27,621 --> 00:08:31,340
So we're hoping that those of you in the
room today and those that are watching

124
00:08:31,341 --> 00:08:35,840
this afterwards, we'll take a
profound interest in this problem,

125
00:08:35,841 --> 00:08:37,850
which is global and it,

126
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:41,150
the impact on the patients'
lives is extraordinary.

127
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,920
It's not generally a life threatening
condition. It does not shorten life,

128
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:50,660
but it certainly impacts the way in
which those individuals could live their

129
00:08:50,661 --> 00:08:55,070
lives. So this is something we need
to embrace. We need to acknowledge,

130
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,070
we need to treat it

131
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:59,910
and eventually we need to be able
to prevent it and reverse it.

132
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:01,530
So that's what I'll say.

133
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:06,550
Oh, thank you for that incredibly
impactful introduction.

134
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:10,240
I for one, will continue to be a champion
of the work that you all are doing.

135
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:11,530
Kathy,

136
00:09:11,530 --> 00:09:15,670
you're here as a spokesperson for learning
the organization we talked about and

137
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:20,260
I think everyone here would really like
to hear about your journey and how,

138
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:20,920
how,

139
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:24,610
how you have found the condition and
what it's been like working with Lauren.

140
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:30,960
Uh, yes, I, I think I don't
need a microphone, but, um, um,

141
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,393
I,

142
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:38,570
six years ago I had a double mastectomy
and I knew what lymphedema was before I

143
00:09:42,811 --> 00:09:45,690
had been diagnosed with breast cancer.

144
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:51,740
I was more afraid of lymph edema then
I was of living without my breasts.

145
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:54,300
Uh,
my mother had it.

146
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:59,130
I saw the effect it had on her left arm
when she had a radical back in the 70s.

147
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:02,670
Her arms swelled terribly.
Um,

148
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:07,700
I had a friend that I knew had
lymphedema in his left arm.

149
00:10:08,281 --> 00:10:09,910
He,
um,

150
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:15,010
had had a melanoma underneath his
arm and they took a tissue from the,

151
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:19,320
the damaged part and reinjected,
you know, so he survived,

152
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:23,130
but his arm was extremely heavy.
Like would,

153
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:25,830
he had seen enough doctors in his life.

154
00:10:25,831 --> 00:10:28,890
He decided so he wouldn't go for care.

155
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:33,300
And it terrified me,
um,

156
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:36,300
that I would get this condition sometimes.

157
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:40,110
We used to go driving in an RV
and driving was very hard for him.

158
00:10:40,111 --> 00:10:43,650
His arm would swell terribly
and we'd stop and get fresh,

159
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,310
high ace bandages and,

160
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:49,890
but sometimes lymph would ooze out of
his fingers because he was so stubborn

161
00:10:49,891 --> 00:10:53,710
about it. Anyway, I was
really concerned. Uh,

162
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:58,840
I thought maybe I would
have a predisposition to it
given my mother's history.

163
00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:01,500
And I remember,
um,

164
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:04,710
on several occasions
really begging my surgeon,

165
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:07,710
please at the sentinel node is clear,
get out.

166
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:12,840
I don't want to have this, I
don't want to have it. And, um,

167
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:17,970
I had the surgery and when I was in the
hospital I was feeling strange little,

168
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:21,390
it was almost like an electrical storm.

169
00:11:21,391 --> 00:11:23,520
And I don't know if this
is lymphedema coming on,

170
00:11:23,521 --> 00:11:28,500
but it certainly felt strange to me. And,
uh, when I went in for my first checkup,

171
00:11:28,501 --> 00:11:32,490
he told me he had taken 19 notes from
this arm and three from the other.

172
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:37,500
I am, uh, because of my career. Uh,

173
00:11:37,501 --> 00:11:40,680
you've seen me in raged
Amin in several roles.

174
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:45,630
I think you should multiply my
reaction by about a hundred.

175
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:51,420
I went nuts and screaming,

176
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:54,520
yelling, crying. Uh, they,

177
00:11:54,521 --> 00:11:57,700
people came in the room
to try to calm me down.

178
00:11:58,030 --> 00:12:02,260
There was a social worker speaking
in that social worker voice.

179
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:07,750
Now we just take a breath and I think
I turned to her like the exorcist,

180
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:11,890
you know,
and I ran out of the building.

181
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:17,340
I left my niece and my best friend and
I ran out of the building in the middle

182
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:22,480
of July, standing near the Beverly Center.
It was so hot. I still had my drains in.

183
00:12:22,481 --> 00:12:27,400
I was holding this pillow and when I
finally came to my senses, I thought,

184
00:12:27,401 --> 00:12:32,260
I can't walk home. I, I don't want
to, you know, get any further damage.

185
00:12:32,261 --> 00:12:35,980
So I was really,
really enraged.

186
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:38,920
And as he told my niece,
he said,

187
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:42,310
lymphedema would be a moot
point if she doesn't survive.

188
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:47,080
I don't want to malign my surgeon.
He's a good man.

189
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:51,940
His focus was on curing me of
cancer period. And in fact,

190
00:12:51,941 --> 00:12:55,600
when I was having my fit in the room,
he kept saying,

191
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:58,420
I cured you a cancer. I cured.
You have cancer. I mean,

192
00:12:58,421 --> 00:13:02,170
he believed that so passionately.
That was his goal.

193
00:13:02,171 --> 00:13:04,480
And he felt that he had accomplished that.
And I,

194
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:08,890
I wouldn't be here today without him.
I have to acknowledge that.

195
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:13,960
So I was pretty angry for a long time.
And then through one of my other surgeons,

196
00:13:13,961 --> 00:13:17,830
I got the name of Dr Emily Eicher and
I found out I could go have manual.

197
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:22,860
I did develop lymphedema in both arms and
they began to swell and I had pain and

198
00:13:24,851 --> 00:13:29,140
heaviness and rashes and a heat.

199
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:32,140
And, uh, so anyway, I went to her very,

200
00:13:32,141 --> 00:13:36,850
very angry person and she was lovely.
And she said,

201
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:41,290
that's all in the past. Lao, let's
begin your new life. She said,

202
00:13:41,291 --> 00:13:45,550
I have a patient who was 105. If you
want to know about the stock market,

203
00:13:45,551 --> 00:13:49,060
call her.
And she dresses in Chanel every day,

204
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,920
so the future is bright for you. So, uh,

205
00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:55,120
then I became involved with Emily.

206
00:13:55,121 --> 00:14:00,121
She has lymphedema in her right leg
and that's why she became involved in

207
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:01,780
specialized in,

208
00:14:01,781 --> 00:14:05,860
in study of lymphatic lymphedema
and lymphatic disease.

209
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:10,960
So I began a program with
her going frequently and
then I was able to taper off.

210
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:12,363
Um,

211
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:17,910
and then Emily led me to bill for PC and,

212
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:19,540
um,
she said,

213
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:24,540
I'm doing this one walk in Venice
and I just don't know how to do this.

214
00:14:24,881 --> 00:14:28,300
And I did that. Okay. I figured
she had ulterior motives.

215
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:32,110
Finally when I figured out
what was going on. And um,

216
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:37,200
bill and I met in New York and bill
gave me the numbers that Stan has just

217
00:14:37,481 --> 00:14:38,141
described.

218
00:14:38,141 --> 00:14:43,141
And then I got really pissed off and I
never have loaned my name to any group

219
00:14:47,531 --> 00:14:50,680
such as this over the course of my career.

220
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:55,790
But I couldn't say no. I
was so enraged. And when I,

221
00:14:55,791 --> 00:14:59,240
the more I learned about it and the more,
the fact that doctors don't know,

222
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:03,660
my goal was to raise awareness.
And that's why I love the name learn.

223
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:09,340
And I just, I thought, and I
went to school, Dan, you know,

224
00:15:09,341 --> 00:15:13,090
when we went to Capitol Hill that
first year, I said, what's the deal?

225
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:17,620
Why can't we just go to Jama and say,
get on the horn, talk to these guys,

226
00:15:17,621 --> 00:15:21,100
let them know what's going on,
have them know what to look out for.

227
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:22,630
And we tried that.

228
00:15:23,170 --> 00:15:27,010
And you even wrote an article that got
turned down in a couple of hours and

229
00:15:27,011 --> 00:15:27,940
under anyway.

230
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:32,670
So it seemed like Everest to me and uh,

231
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:37,240
that I would be going with APP oxygen all
alone. But then as I began the journey,

232
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:41,410
I was relieved to know that there are
actually people and have been people for

233
00:15:41,411 --> 00:15:45,730
the last 15 years,
working diligently on research,

234
00:15:45,731 --> 00:15:50,470
working on trying to raise awareness,
working on trying to reach physicians.

235
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:55,920
And today I'm relieved that
that we are making progress.

236
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:59,530
I left New York,
we went to a cocktail fundraiser,

237
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:02,380
a very wealthy couple,

238
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:06,250
a woman who's very involved in research,

239
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:07,840
my scoby Crosby.

240
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:12,550
And it was fascinating to meet with
her and doctor Diane who is doing a

241
00:16:12,551 --> 00:16:16,480
replacement as you call it, re
reconstructions transfer. Right.

242
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:21,850
And a doctor, uh, uh, Shelly
Feldman, I learned so much from them.

243
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:26,650
Okay, so get this. So they had a
lovely dinner for us afterwards.

244
00:16:26,651 --> 00:16:29,740
And I had my best friend with me
and she was seated next to a one.

245
00:16:29,741 --> 00:16:34,741
I wasn't next to them and it
wasn't very well heeled group.

246
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:40,270
And she was talking to the lady and she
noticed that the lady wasn't eating her

247
00:16:40,371 --> 00:16:43,550
dinner and just pushing her food
around and she seemed upset.

248
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:48,230
And Jennifer asked her, she said,
so why are you here? And whatever.

249
00:16:48,231 --> 00:16:51,730
And the woman just said, oh
my God, now I know what I had.

250
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:58,780
I've had it for years. Right. And
Jennifer was, so she's very shy. Anyway,

251
00:16:58,781 --> 00:17:00,670
so I said, where, where
does she have it? You know,

252
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:04,990
I wanted to know all the details for
our purposes, but she didn't ask.

253
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:05,913
And uh,

254
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:10,920
but I was astounded that someone who had
all the resources and the money to be

255
00:17:10,961 --> 00:17:15,610
educated and to find the best
doctors had been living with this.

256
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:20,800
Uh, and the one other thing, I don't
want to take up too much time, but

257
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:27,090
the numbers that Stan told
me began to disappear.

258
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:30,240
You have to, excuse me if I get
a little emotional about this.

259
00:17:31,290 --> 00:17:33,840
The numbers disappear.
And you know,

260
00:17:33,841 --> 00:17:38,841
when you meet people one on one
and you listen to their story,

261
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:43,980
you begin to empathize with
what they have to deal with.

262
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:48,910
And what I learned was from these people,

263
00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:53,930
I just met Rosalie today who has primary
lymph edema and has it throughout her

264
00:17:54,301 --> 00:17:56,130
body for the last 30 years.

265
00:17:56,760 --> 00:18:00,540
And rose wanted to be an Irish dancer.

266
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:06,750
It reminds me of Pearland Hines,
who was one of people who emailed us,

267
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:11,780
a young woman who suddenly at the age
of 20 her leg blew up the answer just

268
00:18:13,741 --> 00:18:17,940
about to blossom.
And suddenly her career was over.

269
00:18:18,810 --> 00:18:21,900
But instead of getting up,
and this is what I love about this,

270
00:18:21,901 --> 00:18:26,520
is when you really get to know somebody,
you see what they're made of.

271
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:31,530
And after going through the
horror, the denial, the struggle,

272
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:34,790
she realized and she said,
um,

273
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:40,300
I realized that if I
continue to deny this,

274
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:44,110
that the legs of future
generations would be lost.

275
00:18:46,930 --> 00:18:50,800
We have another woman, Karen
Bingham, up in Nova Scotia.

276
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:56,140
Her six of her siblings have it.
Her father had had huge,

277
00:18:56,500 --> 00:19:00,820
huge legs and she didn't know what it was
until the internet came along and then

278
00:19:00,821 --> 00:19:03,730
she began to realize other people
are out there who have this,

279
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:08,320
so she went on Facebook and she posted
a picture of one of her legs because she

280
00:19:08,321 --> 00:19:10,960
figured, you know, a picture's
worth a thousand words,

281
00:19:10,961 --> 00:19:15,310
and she heard from Facebook right away and
said, you have to take this down. It's,

282
00:19:15,311 --> 00:19:18,160
it's,
it's undesirable to look at.

283
00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:23,020
And in all fairness to Facebook,
they have a policy about nudity.

284
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:28,240
And so someone had complained that
here's this woman showing their nude leg.

285
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:33,520
I'm on Facebook,
but things then began to roll for her.

286
00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:38,610
She posted this response on Facebook to
her friends and they got pissed off and

287
00:19:39,431 --> 00:19:40,660
they talked to other people.

288
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:45,190
She developed a seminar for people up
in Nova Scotia. She got local publicity.

289
00:19:45,191 --> 00:19:49,090
Then she got national publicity.
She and I have been DME.

290
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:53,110
She'd went to a gym.
A doctor told her,

291
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:57,470
just don't do anything for two years,
lying in bed, and she said, well,

292
00:19:57,550 --> 00:20:00,640
this is not living. She did it,
but she said, this isn't living.

293
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:03,700
She went and learned how
to be a real estate agent.

294
00:20:03,730 --> 00:20:06,190
Then she went to a gym
that was hard to find.

295
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:11,700
She finally found a guy who worked with
her and she does kickboxing now and she

296
00:20:14,381 --> 00:20:19,170
is very vocal about what's going.
She's joined our group. Uh,

297
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:23,470
she's a wonderful
spokesperson for us. And, um,

298
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:27,760
there's one other young woman that I
want to, young girl really to talk about.

299
00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:31,960
Emma Detlef son who's one of my
favorites that I've stayed in touch with.

300
00:20:31,961 --> 00:20:35,210
And she actually came
with, with us to the, uh,

301
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:39,490
awards that we got in
Washington to stand up. Um,

302
00:20:40,330 --> 00:20:44,230
she has it in her legs,
was born with it and uh,

303
00:20:46,010 --> 00:20:49,750
she at right went to the
New York state legislature.

304
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:54,790
She appeared there and there was a
bill there that's still there, uh,

305
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:58,690
that was languishing
for research. And, uh,

306
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:04,260
after she appeared it was bipartisan
support and one of the, uh,

307
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:08,620
Congress people there said,
we have to help these children.

308
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:12,760
And um,
and then when I think she was about,

309
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:17,020
was it eight or was it the same
year? Right after that. She,

310
00:21:17,530 --> 00:21:21,010
Bill has a wonderful a walk run on the,
over the Brooklyn Bridge,

311
00:21:21,011 --> 00:21:24,790
which I'm going to get to one day.
We have ours in Venice and um,

312
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:30,250
she had, she was our, uh,
youth advocate, right. And uh,

313
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:35,400
she wrote a speech and have to tell you
she in those seven years because of the,

314
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:41,440
uh, cellulitis, which is an infection
that you can very easily, uh,

315
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:45,400
have with any kind of a nick or
cut, you don't know. I've had it,

316
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:48,430
I thought I had a very
mild case of lymph edema,

317
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:51,610
but Stan has explained to
me if you got lymphedema,

318
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:56,640
you got lymphedema and I had to go into
the hospital and was there for almost a

319
00:21:56,740 --> 00:22:01,000
week and they sent in tropical disease
specialist and put me on some kind of

320
00:22:01,001 --> 00:22:04,610
antibiotic that nearly killed me.
And um,

321
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:07,240
they just didn't get it.
Um,

322
00:22:07,270 --> 00:22:12,270
but imagine being a child and in eight
years of your life you've been to the

323
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:17,700
hospital eight times with doctors who
still don't really get it or believe it.

324
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:23,380
She said something at
the end of her speech

325
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:29,080
that will stay with me forever.
She said,

326
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:34,890
if I can do something hard for me like
walk back and forth across the Brooklyn

327
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:36,130
Bridge,

328
00:22:36,130 --> 00:22:40,450
maybe a smart scientist can do something
hard for them and find a cure for this

329
00:22:40,451 --> 00:22:41,284
in my lifetime,

330
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:46,930
the people that I have met through
this program, their courage,

331
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:52,590
their struggle to live with
this has been so touching to me.

332
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,750
The doctors.
However,

333
00:22:55,751 --> 00:22:59,350
I would like to encase
just one leg in concrete.

334
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:03,880
It sounds like I'm going
all Annie Wilkes on them,

335
00:23:05,770 --> 00:23:08,680
but in my business,
imagination is the key.

336
00:23:08,681 --> 00:23:12,850
You have to use your imagination
because only with that can you begin to

337
00:23:12,851 --> 00:23:17,500
empathize. Now, I won't put
you through it today for today,

338
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:22,590
but as a as a thank you to me
for having been here today.

339
00:23:23,650 --> 00:23:28,000
Tonight, when you go to bed,
just lie in bed, close your eyes,

340
00:23:28,090 --> 00:23:29,320
settle,
breathe,

341
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:33,250
and imagine that your right leg,

342
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:38,280
your left leg is so swollen
that it will never go down.

343
00:23:38,561 --> 00:23:42,250
It's like your, your leg is going to
be in jail for the rest of your life.

344
00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:44,800
You're going to have to wear compression,

345
00:23:45,650 --> 00:23:48,890
compression garments if you
can afford them. If they fit,

346
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:52,880
you're going to have to
buy two pairs of pants.

347
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:57,890
You're going to have to buy two pairs
of shoes. If fits in your right leg,

348
00:23:57,891 --> 00:24:01,610
you're going to have a hell
of a hard time driving. Uh,

349
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:06,200
there are so many, just physical
problems alone. They can seem daunting.

350
00:24:07,010 --> 00:24:09,530
It's psychologically debilitating,

351
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:12,230
it's emotionally debilitating.

352
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:17,720
I have talked to people who
have this who have been,

353
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:22,790
I use the word ostracized by doctors.

354
00:24:23,090 --> 00:24:26,780
I think doctors are so turned off,
they just don't want him there.

355
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,000
There's a woman in Russia,
Tatiana,

356
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:34,180
who had it when she was in her twenties
and the doctor literally told her,

357
00:24:34,821 --> 00:24:37,550
you should be glad you have all
your arms and legs get Outta here.

358
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:40,460
So that's what we're up against.

359
00:24:40,461 --> 00:24:44,300
And that's what I've tried to do
is to educate physicians. You know,

360
00:24:44,301 --> 00:24:47,420
if somebody who's notices I've got my
compression sleeve on and they'll say,

361
00:24:47,421 --> 00:24:51,640
what is that? I'll say,
well how long have you are?

362
00:24:52,510 --> 00:24:57,420
Cause I just want to take
every opportunity and you
just never know that you're

363
00:24:57,450 --> 00:25:00,650
showing me. You were saying to me
when we went to physical therapy,

364
00:25:01,370 --> 00:25:06,370
one of the physical therapists there
has it and she came out and talked to me

365
00:25:07,370 --> 00:25:10,340
and you just never know where
you're going to meet people.

366
00:25:10,670 --> 00:25:14,600
So I thank you all for being today.
I hope I haven't gone on too long,

367
00:25:14,601 --> 00:25:18,470
but it's such a, you know,
just to finish up for me,

368
00:25:18,471 --> 00:25:23,060
who spends a lot of time trying to
figure out how to be other people.

369
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:27,470
It's really nice, although I
wish I didn't have lived the day.

370
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:32,800
It's really nice to be able to be me and
to hopefully do some good in the world.

371
00:25:35,330 --> 00:25:38,210
The thank you all so much for being here.
It means the world.

372
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:40,973
Take a moment.

373
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:51,553
I um,

374
00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:56,650
I have to say your passion is so evident
and I can see why they call you all the

375
00:25:59,510 --> 00:26:00,343
Dream Team.

376
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:04,970
And I do think this idea of empathy and
sympathy across the board is something

377
00:26:04,971 --> 00:26:06,440
that we're all striving for.

378
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:09,980
And thank you so much
for sharing your story.

379
00:26:10,550 --> 00:26:14,990
The other thing that's very clear
as I got to know bill recently,

380
00:26:14,991 --> 00:26:19,910
I can see why you were immediately drawn
to learn and I think for all of us,

381
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:23,630
it'd be helpful to hear a little more
about your mission and I'm going to ask

382
00:26:23,631 --> 00:26:28,430
you to share some of the sentiments
you were talking with me about earlier.

383
00:26:28,431 --> 00:26:32,240
When we have a certain
entity like lymphedema,

384
00:26:32,241 --> 00:26:37,241
whether we call it a condition
or a disease matters and
your insights there were

385
00:26:38,570 --> 00:26:43,460
incredibly impactful. So thank you
again for being here. Yeah, yeah,

386
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:44,220
a real pleasure.

387
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:48,780
I get to follow Kathy Bates.
How's that Tara? What?

388
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:53,380
What's funny, I mean this team here,
I mean really a faded to be. I mean,

389
00:26:53,381 --> 00:26:57,540
it lifted emo, lymphatic diseases
have been ignored for a long time. Uh,

390
00:26:57,541 --> 00:27:00,630
when I first met Kathy, Dr Acres,
the window first put us together.

391
00:27:00,631 --> 00:27:04,470
We met in New York and we talked for a
couple of hours and Kathy was listening

392
00:27:04,471 --> 00:27:06,500
intently and at the end of
the conversation said both,

393
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:09,810
this is all fascinating bill.
I have to have to think about it.

394
00:27:09,811 --> 00:27:13,530
I'm not sure if I'm ready to be a
spokesperson. This is all new to me,

395
00:27:13,531 --> 00:27:15,840
but you know,
we'll follow up at a later date,

396
00:27:15,841 --> 00:27:19,830
but I have to go right now because I have
a TV show I need to go to. And I said,

397
00:27:19,831 --> 00:27:22,050
well, what TV show is that
you're doing? And she said, well,

398
00:27:22,051 --> 00:27:27,030
Andy Cohen's watch what
happens. I did this. I said,

399
00:27:27,031 --> 00:27:28,680
Andy lives upstairs from me.

400
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:33,270
And I ranted to Andy and the elevator
yesterday and I asked him if he would be

401
00:27:33,271 --> 00:27:36,990
the very first member of learns
honorary board. And he said, sure,

402
00:27:36,991 --> 00:27:40,290
belt whatever you want.
And Kathy stared at me and said,

403
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:45,120
that's the sign.
That's the side it was meant to be.

404
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:49,770
I learned spokesperson and
that's how it all began.

405
00:27:49,771 --> 00:27:54,390
And kicked off a learned was established
20 years ago. This is in fact,

406
00:27:54,391 --> 00:27:57,770
our 20th anniversary. Stan was
available. Doctor Roxon. Uh,

407
00:27:57,780 --> 00:28:01,740
right from the very beginning of
it, uh, the way it all started, uh,

408
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:06,960
a woman dealt with what women and
families had dealt with for eons,

409
00:28:07,470 --> 00:28:11,940
but not taking the next step. She had a
child, we had a primary lymphatic disease.

410
00:28:11,970 --> 00:28:14,610
Doctors didn't know anything about it.
They didn't have any hope for it.

411
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:15,780
They didn't know how to treat it.

412
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:20,040
She decided that that wasn't acceptable
and began the process of creating this

413
00:28:20,041 --> 00:28:25,041
organization that we then focus mainly
on the whole research issue because then

414
00:28:25,411 --> 00:28:26,580
there was very little research.

415
00:28:26,581 --> 00:28:30,120
So how do you get researchers into the
field to begin really looking at this

416
00:28:30,121 --> 00:28:34,550
issue? By the time I come around,
which is six years ago, uh,

417
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:38,760
I come in and I'm interviewed for a
job that didn't give the name of the

418
00:28:38,761 --> 00:28:41,190
organization or mentioned
the word lymphatics.

419
00:28:41,370 --> 00:28:43,740
So when I got done and they
told me what this was about,

420
00:28:43,741 --> 00:28:47,790
I actually turned the job down when it
was offered to me because I knew nothing

421
00:28:47,791 --> 00:28:50,280
about lymphatics or lymphedema.
That was not my background.

422
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:54,420
I had a specialty and
developmental disabilities and
infectious diseases to some

423
00:28:54,421 --> 00:28:58,650
degree from working in Kenya, et
Cetera. But this was unknown to me.

424
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,200
After turning that job down,

425
00:29:01,201 --> 00:29:04,020
I went out and started talking to
people and talk to some of the most

426
00:29:04,021 --> 00:29:07,920
sophisticated, wealthy as, uh,
most educated people. I knew.

427
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:12,110
None of them knew what I was talking
about until I described it and invariably

428
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:13,680
after I did describe it,

429
00:29:13,681 --> 00:29:17,910
the response was my mother has
that she had breast cancer.

430
00:29:17,911 --> 00:29:19,680
Her arms like this,
it has a name,

431
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:24,360
doctor's wife raising or like in the air
saying whatever you're talking about,

432
00:29:24,361 --> 00:29:27,900
I've had it since I was a child. My
doctor says it's called drainage issues.

433
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:32,100
What became fascinating to me of
why it went back and took the job,

434
00:29:32,101 --> 00:29:36,530
as I began to see the
marketing implications of what
was going on here, as as,

435
00:29:36,531 --> 00:29:38,520
as Dr Roxanne and Cathy have said,

436
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:43,060
we estimate there could be
up to 10 million people in
the states alone that have

437
00:29:43,061 --> 00:29:45,580
lymphedema.
I started putting the numbers together.

438
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:48,430
How many people in the United
States had multiple sclerosis?

439
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:53,140
500,000 how many of the AIDS,
300,000 perhaps a million or HIV positive.

440
00:29:53,410 --> 00:29:58,390
How many have als? About 30,000 when
all was said and done. Parkinson's.

441
00:29:58,391 --> 00:29:59,224
About a million.

442
00:29:59,470 --> 00:30:03,010
It turned out there are far more people
with lymphedema then all those other

443
00:30:03,011 --> 00:30:04,660
diseases combined.

444
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:09,220
How is it possible that we know so much
about all those other diseases and yet

445
00:30:09,250 --> 00:30:13,690
this disease we know absolutely nothing
about including most people who haven't,

446
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:18,370
don't know that they actually have this
disease. So a lot of our effort has been,

447
00:30:18,371 --> 00:30:22,340
is peeling back the onion of
what are all those obstacles? Uh,

448
00:30:22,450 --> 00:30:23,470
well there are multitude.

449
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:27,250
Dr Roxanne mentioned one right off the
bat and that's the fact that if doctors

450
00:30:27,251 --> 00:30:28,930
don't learn about this in medical tool,

451
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:32,530
they're not passing that information
on to their patients afterwards.

452
00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:36,510
The fact that most of the people in the
United States who have lymphedema have

453
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:38,260
it as a result of cancer treatment.

454
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:41,790
They're being treated by oncologists
who very often their senses,

455
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:45,730
I've treated the cancer. Uh, if you
develop lymphedema, find a therapist,

456
00:30:45,731 --> 00:30:47,260
don't complain,
I saved your life.

457
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:52,420
And unfortunately too many people have
taken that advice and gone ahead and done

458
00:30:52,421 --> 00:30:55,960
that. We have the problem
of the word lymphedema.

459
00:30:56,890 --> 00:31:00,670
It's a difficult word. People don't
remember it. We talk about TB,

460
00:31:01,030 --> 00:31:05,140
Ms Als, how many people here can tell
me what als stands for? You can't.

461
00:31:05,170 --> 00:31:08,710
The reason is you don't need to,
it's too complicated. If you had to,

462
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:12,190
it would put you at a distance
from knowing anything about
the disease. At learn,

463
00:31:12,191 --> 00:31:16,420
we start using Ellie and we use it
pretty uniformly as as the [inaudible] an

464
00:31:16,421 --> 00:31:20,710
acronym for it. For it. I was saying to,
we were talking earlier when it comes to,

465
00:31:20,711 --> 00:31:23,470
what do you call it, I think
doctors, very often you,

466
00:31:23,471 --> 00:31:27,850
you need to feel very much like God
considering that people are coming to you

467
00:31:27,851 --> 00:31:28,870
looking to be cure.

468
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:32,410
So what happens when somebody comes to
you with something you don't know how to

469
00:31:32,411 --> 00:31:35,200
treat and don't know how to cure?
Well, you have a couple of options.

470
00:31:35,201 --> 00:31:38,800
Either you're or you're not god,
or perhaps this isn't that important.

471
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,670
I think there's a tendency
to lean toward the latter.

472
00:31:43,270 --> 00:31:48,270
I think using words like condition
becomes a euphemism which softens the

473
00:31:48,731 --> 00:31:51,880
importance of what this disease is.
And I was saying with Jess,

474
00:31:51,881 --> 00:31:56,590
I talked about very strong headed woman
who runs a company with for compression.

475
00:31:57,010 --> 00:32:01,960
She has a lymphedema as a result of breast
cancer and during our conversation I

476
00:32:01,961 --> 00:32:05,770
said, well, you know, really when you have
a disease like 50 a month, blah, blah,

477
00:32:05,771 --> 00:32:10,210
blah, and she stopped me and said, what
did you just say? I said, well, I said,

478
00:32:10,211 --> 00:32:14,410
when you have a disease, like I don't
have a disease, I have a condition.

479
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:17,920
How dare you say I have a
disease? And I said, well,

480
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:21,340
you have a disease and the condition
is a euphemism. What disease?

481
00:32:21,341 --> 00:32:24,320
Up in the dictionary there's a definition
for call doctor rocks and have a

482
00:32:24,321 --> 00:32:27,610
conversation about it. I called Stan
just you know, to check and make sure.

483
00:32:27,611 --> 00:32:30,400
Absolutely.
Her response after that was,

484
00:32:30,430 --> 00:32:34,720
are you telling me I had the disease
of cancer and treating it gave me the

485
00:32:34,721 --> 00:32:38,200
disease of lymph edema.
Now I'm twice as a raise.

486
00:32:38,201 --> 00:32:40,220
I was before conditions.

487
00:32:40,221 --> 00:32:45,050
You just have to live with
diseases you cure. I want a cure.

488
00:32:45,470 --> 00:32:46,790
I thought,
well how fascinating.

489
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:51,820
Even language like that can be
a major factor in a movement.

490
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:54,560
The other thing is,

491
00:32:55,610 --> 00:32:58,700
I met a couple of women when I
first took this job and I said,

492
00:32:58,701 --> 00:33:01,880
what does it like to have lymphedema?
And the first response was, well,

493
00:33:01,881 --> 00:33:03,980
build our worst things in the world.
And I said,

494
00:33:03,981 --> 00:33:07,190
well then I just made a huge mistake and
I should be going doing those things,

495
00:33:07,191 --> 00:33:10,490
which are more important rather
than doing this. And then they said,

496
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:12,020
do you want to know what it's really like?

497
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:16,550
And they began saying the things
that Kathy just said. Okay,

498
00:33:16,551 --> 00:33:21,551
imagine you had 15 pounds of
weight on this part of your body.

499
00:33:21,950 --> 00:33:23,360
You don't have the
other part of your body.

500
00:33:23,510 --> 00:33:25,520
Your spouse never wants to
have sex with you again.

501
00:33:25,790 --> 00:33:27,470
People mock you when
you're out on the street,

502
00:33:27,710 --> 00:33:30,680
you end up in the hospital several times
a year with infection that you don't

503
00:33:30,681 --> 00:33:34,160
know whether they're going to cure or not.
You love to travel,

504
00:33:34,161 --> 00:33:36,050
but now you're afraid
to cause high altitudes,

505
00:33:36,051 --> 00:33:39,590
exacerbate your lymphedema
and on and on and on.

506
00:33:39,591 --> 00:33:41,390
And they finally get to the end of saying,
you know what?

507
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:45,710
Lymphedema is worse than cancer.
Cancer. The Cure. LYMPHEDEMA is forever.

508
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:49,910
The whole idea having a disease that
you have to treat for hours a day leaves

509
00:33:49,911 --> 00:33:52,220
you to facilitate it for
the rest of your life.

510
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:57,200
And although we do say it in, in and
of itself, it doesn't lead to death.

511
00:33:57,650 --> 00:33:57,861
I mean,

512
00:33:57,861 --> 00:34:02,861
the fact is I get more memorials donated
to learn because of people who have had

513
00:34:04,161 --> 00:34:09,161
infections that antibiotics
could no longer treat who
died as a result or people

514
00:34:09,261 --> 00:34:11,450
who gained so much weight
because of their lymph edema,

515
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:16,370
that would be it debilitated
them and it caused, uh, uh,

516
00:34:16,550 --> 00:34:21,050
other things to occur that actually lead
to a premature death. On the other hand,

517
00:34:21,051 --> 00:34:24,230
though, there are lots of things we
don't deal with that we don't die from,

518
00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:29,510
that impact our quality of life to such
an extent that we give a great deal of

519
00:34:29,511 --> 00:34:30,344
attention to.

520
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:34,190
This hasn't been one and a big part of
our job right now is how do we develop

521
00:34:34,191 --> 00:34:37,100
that activism so that people come forward.

522
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:40,790
I talked to dark Dr. Anthony Fowchee
down at the national institutes of health

523
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:46,000
and doctor [inaudible] was key during
the aids epidemic and he said he went to

524
00:34:46,191 --> 00:34:47,780
Nih Beck in 1984.

525
00:34:48,140 --> 00:34:51,650
And at that point he said Nih
was not very interested in aids.

526
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:56,260
It was effecting marginalized
populations. And uh, there was no, uh,

527
00:34:56,450 --> 00:34:59,690
excitement about necessarily getting
overly involved in this. However,

528
00:34:59,691 --> 00:35:02,960
because of groups like act up, gay
men's health crisis, et Cetera,

529
00:35:02,961 --> 00:35:06,320
that came forward and said,
we are not taking no for an answer.

530
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:10,130
Shortly after NIH began
putting 10% of their budget,

531
00:35:10,550 --> 00:35:15,080
$3 billion a year into aids research,
20 years later,

532
00:35:15,350 --> 00:35:19,610
it was a treatable disease where
people could live normal lives.

533
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,560
Fast forward to us,

534
00:35:21,710 --> 00:35:26,420
we got Senator Schumer to put in a $70
million appropriations requests for

535
00:35:26,421 --> 00:35:29,290
lymphatic research.
The first seven calls,

536
00:35:29,291 --> 00:35:33,620
I called up the office where people
saying it was a big step backwards.

537
00:35:33,770 --> 00:35:35,180
We were wasting our time.

538
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:39,270
There would never be a cure for lymphedema
and we were wasting our time looking

539
00:35:39,271 --> 00:35:40,104
for one.

540
00:35:40,510 --> 00:35:45,510
I was shocked that the population of
people that have this disease had been so

541
00:35:45,571 --> 00:35:50,070
cow by everything they've lived with up
to this point that they didn't even have

542
00:35:50,071 --> 00:35:54,300
hope. We need people to have
hope. So with our organization,

543
00:35:54,301 --> 00:35:59,220
we focus now not only on research but
certainly on education and advocacy.

544
00:35:59,430 --> 00:36:02,730
Actually a two of the people here
from citizen group that rebranded our

545
00:36:02,731 --> 00:36:05,940
organization, we used to be called
the lymphatic research foundation.

546
00:36:05,941 --> 00:36:09,060
Now we're called lymphatic education
and research network and they helped

547
00:36:09,210 --> 00:36:13,410
rebrand from citizen group to give us
the new name and expand our mission

548
00:36:13,411 --> 00:36:16,380
because we need to do it all.
We need people to be angry.

549
00:36:16,470 --> 00:36:17,970
We need people to be activists.

550
00:36:18,090 --> 00:36:22,110
We have chapters all around the world at
this point and you'll see a little film

551
00:36:22,350 --> 00:36:25,260
that a a Kathy hosts about
world and edema midday.

552
00:36:25,590 --> 00:36:30,000
We created world lymph edema day and the
idea was we need more than awareness.

553
00:36:30,390 --> 00:36:31,380
We need research,

554
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:34,710
we need it to be international and
we need to make this an international

555
00:36:34,711 --> 00:36:35,544
priority.

556
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:40,290
So learned at this point has
a whole variety of programs
that not only feed into

557
00:36:40,291 --> 00:36:44,970
researchers and doing research but also
for patients themselves to educate them

558
00:36:44,971 --> 00:36:48,950
through a symposiums, asking
experts, et cetera. But uh,

559
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:53,960
also by allowing them to congregate and
feel that incredible embrace of another

560
00:36:54,061 --> 00:36:57,740
person with a disease that they thought
they were the only one in the world had.

561
00:36:57,990 --> 00:37:02,100
Cause it's only then that you get that
power that one needs to know I'm not

562
00:37:02,101 --> 00:37:04,200
alone.
We are empowered.

563
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:07,800
We do have a right to aspire for more
and we're not going to stand still and be

564
00:37:07,801 --> 00:37:10,590
quiet until we actually get
what we are searching for.

565
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:13,950
And that is we want new treatments and
cures and that's going to take money.

566
00:37:13,951 --> 00:37:15,660
And we need government
to support us in that.

567
00:37:20,210 --> 00:37:25,210
If we want to win this fight, we need
to stand together and educate the world.

568
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:51,340
All of us who've had the courage to
speak about our personal battles with

569
00:37:51,341 --> 00:37:56,341
lymphedema or making a real difference
all across the u s even in Russia,

570
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:03,240
Australia and India are stories or giving
others hope as they realize they're

571
00:38:05,141 --> 00:38:05,974
