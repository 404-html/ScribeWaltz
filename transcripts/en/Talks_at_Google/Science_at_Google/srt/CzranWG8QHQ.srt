1
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:10,350
Thank you so much for, uh, for
joining us, Luke, um, uh, you know,

2
00:00:10,351 --> 00:00:15,180
as her getting introduced
where we'll definitely talk
a bunch about, uh, Lee Hood,

3
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:19,590
uh, based on the work that you
guys, uh, if it's you, you,
you, uh, put together. But,

4
00:00:19,591 --> 00:00:22,760
uh, I really wanted to
start by talking about, uh,

5
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,620
by talking about you and I was just
asking you a moment ago, uh, you know,

6
00:00:25,621 --> 00:00:29,460
how often it is. I, I've seen
any number of times you've, uh,

7
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:32,340
you've moderated an interview or
moderated a group of panelists,

8
00:00:32,341 --> 00:00:35,730
but how often are you on, on this
end of the, uh, the interview?

9
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:39,570
Well, increasingly I am on
the receiving end of these

10
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:45,270
speaking on public radio from
time to time, um, at panels.

11
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:48,690
Sometimes people want to know at
industry events, you know, what's,

12
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:54,000
what's hot and interesting for the
journalists. So, no, no. Perfect.

13
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:57,440
12. Great. I have a whole bunch of
awkward questions here for you. Uh,

14
00:00:57,441 --> 00:01:01,730
so we'll just get started with a couple,
a couple good ones. Um, maybe, maybe just,

15
00:01:01,731 --> 00:01:04,250
uh, just so folks know a
little bit more about you,

16
00:01:04,251 --> 00:01:08,390
can you tell us a little bit about your
background? Uh, you know, kind of how you,

17
00:01:08,391 --> 00:01:12,130
how you made the path from a, I think you
grew up in Wisconsin, if I remember, uh,

18
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:13,390
all the way to being a,

19
00:01:13,391 --> 00:01:16,100
a biotech journalist and doing
amazing work you're doing now.

20
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:21,170
Yeah, sure. So I studied journalism
at the University of Wisconsin.

21
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,820
Wasn't sure what a I would specialize
in or even if I would specialize,

22
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:30,050
that wasn't really a thing in the
90s. It was coming up. Um, but, um,

23
00:01:30,410 --> 00:01:34,010
I ended up getting a job at the Seattle
Times as a general business reporter.

24
00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:35,830
And, uh, uh,

25
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:40,850
about a year into that stint I
had shown some ability to explain,

26
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:42,500
uh,
jargony,

27
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:46,880
boring kind of subjects to
the editors in plain English.

28
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:48,500
I could bring those things to life.

29
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:53,560
And at the time the newspaper
still had a biotechnology beat.

30
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:58,370
Uh, they had a dedicated report on
the business staff and, uh, I, uh,

31
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:00,260
there were two openings.
It's interesting.

32
00:02:00,261 --> 00:02:04,660
At the time I was about
ready to get promoted and one
was for biotech and Morton

33
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:09,260
was for retail. So I could have
cup of Starbucks, Costco, Amazon,

34
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:13,580
and my whole path would've been different.
But I looked at biotech and I thought,

35
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:17,750
uh, there's science, there's human health,

36
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:21,260
there's business,
there are ethical issues,

37
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:25,720
there are all of these
interesting characters, like
charismatic entrepreneurs.

38
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:30,710
It all changes really fast.
There's no one dominant company.

39
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:34,610
So in Seattle at the time of the business
desk, uh, you wanted to get ahead,

40
00:02:34,611 --> 00:02:37,760
you would come, or Boeing or Microsoft
and one of the big companies,

41
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:40,790
but I kind of looked at some of the
stories that were coming out of there and

42
00:02:40,791 --> 00:02:44,850
thought, Oh gee, another jet order
for Singapore or you know, the,

43
00:02:44,851 --> 00:02:46,310
the latest version of windows.

44
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:51,800
I thought biotech had rich
ingredients for storytelling. And uh,

45
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:55,560
so I kind of dived in. That
would have been 2001. Uh,

46
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:58,910
it was just in the wake of the
human genome project. And I had,

47
00:02:58,911 --> 00:03:00,460
this is getting interesting.
I could,

48
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:03,350
I could imagine doing this a
long time and not getting bored.

49
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,760
We'll come back to Seattle
in a, in a, in a moment. Uh,

50
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:10,210
cause I'd love to hear kind
of what you've seen, uh, in,

51
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:13,810
in the Seattle and northwest
geography kind of a cause.

52
00:03:13,811 --> 00:03:16,930
There's obviously been a lot
of change there, but, um, uh,

53
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:21,280
but you then ended up at economy and
then more recently you've started the

54
00:03:21,281 --> 00:03:25,840
Timmerman report. Ah, you had done
the book, you've done, uh, the Po,

55
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:29,320
there's a podcast that you
started, uh, you had a brief,

56
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:32,270
a bit where you're doing
some stuff with stat news a,

57
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:35,870
so just can you give us a sense of
how you ended up at economy and then,

58
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:39,220
and then really kind of, you know,
your own entrepreneurial journey, uh,

59
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:43,510
from going from a larger publication
to going off and doing your own thing.

60
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:44,680
How did you decide to do that?

61
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:48,210
Yeah. Well, um, this being Google, I mean,

62
00:03:48,211 --> 00:03:52,410
you understand the disruption that's
occurred in the media business.

63
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:57,510
Um, and so I was coming
up at a traditional media
company, the Seattle Times,

64
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:02,430
and uh, realized that, uh, there
wasn't much of a web strategy.

65
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:04,320
And about the mid two thousands,

66
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:08,640
they're still very much
wedded to traditional print
advertising and there were

67
00:04:08,641 --> 00:04:12,820
all kinds of painful cuts
and things going on. Um,

68
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:17,370
and so I thought, you know, I, I
don't think this is for me a longterm,

69
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:21,780
um, I was beginning to really sink
my teeth into biotech and specialize.

70
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:26,460
I had done a fellowship at MIT for
science journalists for about a year,

71
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:29,820
and that was sort of
the moment where it was,

72
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,390
it dawned on me that I could do this,

73
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:38,430
I might need to figure out the
right structure, um, online, um,

74
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:43,320
to do that. And it's economy was
that I joined a startup 2008. Um,

75
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:47,250
and, uh, it was really focused
on all things innovative.

76
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:52,410
So the two guys and a dog startup all
the way up through the more interesting

77
00:04:52,411 --> 00:04:56,010
projects that say a big company
might be working on and Alzheimer's.

78
00:04:56,430 --> 00:05:01,290
And it was a great window
into the world of biotech. Um,

79
00:05:01,291 --> 00:05:02,700
I didn't have to worry about,
you know,

80
00:05:02,701 --> 00:05:06,540
the daily stock fluctuations so much I
could focus on the science and how it was

81
00:05:06,541 --> 00:05:11,520
being applied. And, uh, so
I developed a following,

82
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:15,270
um, social media came on board. Um,

83
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:20,300
it became clear that I had sort of what
you might call high affinity audience.

84
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:26,130
I wasn't going to reach the largest
number of people in the world with writing

85
00:05:26,131 --> 00:05:30,210
about genomics or you know,
cancer immunotherapy.

86
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:35,420
But there was a small core of people
who were very intently interested in my

87
00:05:35,521 --> 00:05:40,270
subject material so that,
um, by the time I was, uh,

88
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:43,770
about to move on from economy 2014,

89
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,780
I was thinking that yes,

90
00:05:45,781 --> 00:05:50,781
I could potentially hang up my own shingle
as an independent media entrepreneur

91
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:56,330
focused on my biotech niche and then I
can layer in some of these other things

92
00:05:56,930 --> 00:06:01,490
like podcasts. Um, eventually when
I finally got my book published,

93
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:05,120
I could get that kind of in the portfolio,
um,

94
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:09,760
as different ways to reach people in the,
the information comments screen.

95
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:12,570
So you started with the website and then,
uh,

96
00:06:12,571 --> 00:06:15,230
in the background we're building the book,
writing the book.

97
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:17,840
Is that how it worked or how
did you actually start that?

98
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:21,530
I started the hood project
while I was still at economy,

99
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,180
but I like a lot of authors.

100
00:06:23,181 --> 00:06:25,970
I got to this point where I realized
I've done all these interviews,

101
00:06:25,971 --> 00:06:28,550
I've got all these documents,
it's a mountain of material.

102
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:32,390
I've got all my daily deadlines, when
am I actually going to write this thing?

103
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:37,550
So I actually had to swallow hard and say,
you know what,

104
00:06:37,551 --> 00:06:41,810
I think I need to leave my job if I'm
actually going to write this book.

105
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:44,920
Basically give myself a leave of absence.
Um,

106
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:49,460
which was almost a year to actually
write the book, finish it, get it edited.

107
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:53,720
And then, um, I started
the Timmerman report.

108
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:58,970
Who was actually the book
that prompted you to, to take
the next step. Yeah. Great.

109
00:06:58,971 --> 00:07:01,430
Okay. That's, that's real interesting.
Different than what I had thought. Um,

110
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:06,890
so let's, let's, uh, let's
turn our attention to the
book. Um, so, you know, as,

111
00:07:06,891 --> 00:07:10,570
as, as I read through it, one thing that
was striking and I as, as you know, I,

112
00:07:10,571 --> 00:07:11,900
I actually listened to it on audio books.

113
00:07:11,901 --> 00:07:14,180
I'm going to ask you some
questions on that as well. But, um,

114
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:18,350
but how did you come to the idea
of writing a book to begin with?

115
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:22,070
Is that just the dream of every journal
is because I can't say that many of the

116
00:07:22,071 --> 00:07:26,030
folks that we interact with have
actually written such a, um, you know,

117
00:07:26,031 --> 00:07:29,360
it's such a long form sort of a, you
know, piece of writing and, you know,

118
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:33,740
how did you come to choose Lee and how did
the initial interaction, uh, with Lego,

119
00:07:33,741 --> 00:07:37,640
cause I can imagine it being
easy or challenging cause
he's such a unique finger

120
00:07:37,641 --> 00:07:41,410
in this. How did, how did, how
did it start? Yeah, so, um, I,

121
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:44,420
I was starting to get the
itch to write a book, uh,

122
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:47,280
in the last couple of years at economy.
Um,

123
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:51,680
I had some experience writing
magazine type profiles of people.

124
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:56,710
I thought I enjoyed getting to know
people and their life story as a way of

125
00:07:56,751 --> 00:08:01,610
shining light on the history of
how technologies develop really.

126
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:02,960
And um,

127
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:08,290
along in 2011 comes the Steve
Jobs book by Walter Isaacson.

128
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:09,890
And I read this and I thought,

129
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:14,270
now this is a great example of what
you might call a living biography, uh,

130
00:08:14,271 --> 00:08:18,920
because he was able to do a whole series
of interviews with jobs for last couple

131
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,030
of years when he was still alive.

132
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:25,390
And so you could get a lot of rich
detail that you can never get just from

133
00:08:25,401 --> 00:08:29,390
reading the documentary record. You
supplement the record with the interviews.

134
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:33,920
And so, um, this is, you
know, a big bestseller to it.

135
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:36,770
So it was kind of inspiring and I
looked around and thought, okay,

136
00:08:36,771 --> 00:08:41,771
I'm in biotech who do I know who has had
some kind of catalytic effect on this

137
00:08:43,791 --> 00:08:48,760
industry and maybe not as many aspects
of tech that jobs did, but, um,

138
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:51,680
immediately thought of hood.
Now is you remember I was,

139
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:56,100
I got started at the Seattle Times,
uh, and based there and hood,

140
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:57,910
um, had, um,

141
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:01,350
I got to know him very early
on as a newspaper reporter.

142
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:05,180
So I had a reporter source
relationship with him. Uh,

143
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:07,530
I had covered his institute
for systems biology,

144
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:11,790
which was sort of his next big idea
in the wake of the genome project.

145
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:15,510
Um, and in various startup
companies he had been involved in.

146
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:20,730
And I knew that there was this tremendous
force of personality and that he was,

147
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:24,810
he had a signature achievement that I
could explain to anybody on the street.

148
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:28,710
And that was that he led the team
that developed the first automated DNA

149
00:09:28,711 --> 00:09:33,240
sequencer. So this was a tool
that revolutionized biology,

150
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:37,160
we can say with the benefit
of hindsight. And it was, uh,

151
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:41,040
akin to the development of
the, the better, faster,

152
00:09:41,041 --> 00:09:43,980
cheaper semiconductors
that Intel developed, uh,

153
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:49,010
more Gordon Moore and Bob Noyce had that
kind of a catalytic and enabling effect

154
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:52,320
on technology.
So I thought hood was a great subject.

155
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:56,480
When you, uh, so you'd
known him, uh, from, um,

156
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:59,330
from your time on the
reporting side of it. Uh,

157
00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:01,490
how did you broach that subject with him?

158
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,210
Yeah, that's a good
question. Uh, because, uh,

159
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:08,320
so looking at those of you who've read
the Isaacson book know that it pulls no

160
00:10:08,321 --> 00:10:13,180
punches. There's the good Steven, but not
so good Steve in there. And uh, you know,

161
00:10:13,181 --> 00:10:16,870
as an independent journalist,
that's the kind of book I would write a,

162
00:10:16,871 --> 00:10:18,160
that's what I'll spend my time on.

163
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:23,260
So I propose something like this to Lee
and there's going to be a good lead in a

164
00:10:23,261 --> 00:10:24,190
badly in this book.

165
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:29,150
I told him that I would talk to your
friends and your enemies, your family. Um,

166
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,400
I want to tell the good,
the bad and the ugly. Um,

167
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:36,190
I don't know exactly what I'm
going to find at the outset. Um,

168
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:41,080
but basically you need to
put your confidence in me
that I'm going to be fair to

169
00:10:41,081 --> 00:10:43,690
you, uh, that I'm going to
do my best to get it right.

170
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:46,960
We're always going to see eye to eye.
Um,

171
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:50,170
and it turned out that at the time he
had been thinking about writing his own

172
00:10:50,171 --> 00:10:54,430
memoir and it was kind of
a, a difficult thing. Like,

173
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:57,880
he was just going to hire somebody to do
it and he didn't really have time. And,

174
00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:02,990
and he sort of looked and thought, okay,
if you do this independent, um, uh,

175
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:04,061
number one,

176
00:11:04,061 --> 00:11:08,260
more people are likely to read it
because it won't be sort of the world

177
00:11:08,261 --> 00:11:12,820
according to Lee, a whitewashed version.
Um, and, and number two, I mean,

178
00:11:12,821 --> 00:11:16,210
I think he had confidence in me that
I knew the science and could put it in

179
00:11:16,211 --> 00:11:19,300
context.
So he agreed to let the chips fall.

180
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:22,630
I'll agree to all the interviews you
willing to do. I'll open up my papers.

181
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:26,140
So he was really good at,
uh, at being cooperative.

182
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:30,900
So often you hear, uh, about about, uh,
you know, biographies in that format.

183
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:33,840
And I think that was even the case with
Isaacson and jobs where there was kind

184
00:11:33,841 --> 00:11:38,340
of a tension or a debate it in it, but
it sounds like he was overall, you know,

185
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:39,980
open to it and actually relieved.

186
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:42,890
I have to read the book himself.
Are there, there ones that I mean,

187
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:45,190
but certainly there were tensions,
um,

188
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:50,110
especially getting closer to the end when
you're fact checking some parts of the

189
00:11:50,111 --> 00:11:54,480
story that don't jibe with his version of,
um,

190
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:58,750
and he'd give us a couple
of examples. Well, um,

191
00:11:58,930 --> 00:12:01,630
so it might be hard for those
who haven't read the book,

192
00:12:01,631 --> 00:12:06,310
but there's a passage in here in which
I report on how he was ousted as the

193
00:12:06,311 --> 00:12:11,311
chairman of biology at Caltech and
that was not reported at the time.

194
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:16,270
So when hood left Caltech in 1991,

195
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:20,710
he was recruited by Bill Gates to the
University of Washington and this was sort

196
00:12:20,711 --> 00:12:25,060
of like the dawn of a
technology driven biology,

197
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:29,410
biology becoming more data driven,
more of an information science.

198
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:33,960
He and gates shared this vision and
it was a big story when, you know,

199
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:36,910
this great scientists from
Caltech came to Seattle.

200
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:42,030
It was in the Wall Street Journal and
none of the underlying tensions of what

201
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:46,630
really led to his departure
from Caltech where reported.

202
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:50,860
Now as a biographer looking at these
things in the documentary record and

203
00:12:50,861 --> 00:12:52,570
interviewing people 20 years later,

204
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:55,480
you can dig deeper and get
into more of the story. And,

205
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:59,140
and that was embarrassing and hurtful.

206
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:03,730
And there were times during the fact
checking process when Lee would try to

207
00:13:03,731 --> 00:13:06,040
revert back to the, uh, the silica,

208
00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:09,880
the cover story that Caltech was telling
that enabled him to save face at the

209
00:13:09,881 --> 00:13:13,850
time. So we, we had some tensions.
We had some battles, right?

210
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:17,980
Are those things, one of the
things I took away as I was, uh,

211
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:22,400
as I was reading through the book is
that there's this element to Lee that I

212
00:13:22,401 --> 00:13:26,780
think is similar to some of the
other great innovators of our time.

213
00:13:26,781 --> 00:13:30,190
Whether you think of a Steve Jobs,
uh, you know, or an Eric Lander,

214
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:34,220
kind of the variety of other, um, folks
who we all kind of see, see in the media,

215
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,540
uh, or in our companies and whatnot. Um,

216
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:39,740
where there's a bigger than
life sort of quality. There's a,

217
00:13:39,741 --> 00:13:42,350
this is the grand vision
of what we're going to do,

218
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:47,300
even though it may not be clear how
we're going to do it at the outset.

219
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:52,400
Um, as you spent time with Lee and wrote
the book and thought through that came

220
00:13:52,401 --> 00:13:56,270
through in the book, that there's
clearly that part to his persona. Um,

221
00:13:56,630 --> 00:13:59,750
did you find that that was balanced by
some other part where it's like, you know,

222
00:13:59,751 --> 00:14:02,990
he also did produce the first
automated sequencer, right?

223
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:06,230
That's a technical achievement.
You know, how much of, you know,

224
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:09,230
to the extent that achieving great things,
uh,

225
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:13,070
takes breaking through barriers and
looking at the world in different ways in,

226
00:14:13,071 --> 00:14:14,660
in somebody's likely, you know, what PR,

227
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:19,130
how much of him is grander than a
grand and how much of it is, look,

228
00:14:19,131 --> 00:14:22,130
we've got to make the stuff work. Is
it 50, 50, or, you know, just as you,

229
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:25,040
as you dug into his persona,
how much of it did you see?

230
00:14:25,041 --> 00:14:27,320
Or maybe there's a
different framing a to it,

231
00:14:27,321 --> 00:14:30,500
especially as you've talked to some of
these other entrepreneurs who have, uh,

232
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:32,570
those parts to their
persona personas as well.

233
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,250
It's a great point.

234
00:14:34,251 --> 00:14:38,780
There really are some common personality
traits that you see in the people that

235
00:14:38,781 --> 00:14:42,200
really shake up a field and, and, uh,

236
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:44,600
lead us to a new,
a new path.

237
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:49,210
And it really is this
single minded intensity, uh,

238
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:52,790
that, so first is the vision. Um,

239
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:57,110
and he is a biologist first and foremost.
This is, this is where he came from,

240
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:58,980
that his training,
uh,

241
00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:03,560
and he really wanted to answer big
questions about biology that you could not

242
00:15:03,561 --> 00:15:04,710
answer.
Uh,

243
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:09,910
things like how is it that we are able
to moat an infinite number of antibodies

244
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:15,110
in our immune system to protect us from
all these pathogens in the environment,

245
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:17,840
the viruses, the bacteria,
when we only have,

246
00:15:17,841 --> 00:15:22,550
we don't have a gene for every single
one of those. How does that happen? Uh,

247
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:25,310
they didn't have the tools for that,
so he,

248
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:30,140
he wanted the answer really
bad. And you know, he was, um,

249
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:34,940
dedicated to using,
to developing technology to,

250
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:37,400
to run bigger,

251
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:42,530
broader experiments to gather the
kinds of data that you would need to,

252
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:47,630
to answer a question of that
magnitude. And, um, he just,

253
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,730
once he developed the vision,

254
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:54,760
he just had this single minded intensity
and you can even see on the cover photo

255
00:15:55,161 --> 00:15:58,850
of the book, that photo
captures it. Uh, it's,

256
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:02,750
it's like this guy is in the
zone. He's like, you know,

257
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:08,090
tiger woods lining up for a Putt, or,
you know, uh, Lance Armstrong on the,

258
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:12,770
you know, in the Tour de
France, uh, there's a focus,

259
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:16,970
a purpose, and, and no buddies rules,

260
00:16:16,971 --> 00:16:19,840
nobody's bureaucracy. Nobody's, uh,

261
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:23,330
sensitivities are going to
get in the way of that goal.

262
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:25,460
That's who he who he was.

263
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:30,610
And so it was both his great
strength and at times a weakness.

264
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:35,950
Yeah. Yeah. Which I feel like we see so
much so often that those two things, um,

265
00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:40,360
both change the world, but also can
be painful for the people around them.

266
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:44,140
That must've come out as you were talking
to the people surrounding we as well,

267
00:16:44,141 --> 00:16:46,960
just kind of the inspiration
that they draw and, and

268
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:48,870
perhaps some of the challenges of,
uh,

269
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:52,690
of working in the environment
that's created in that.
That's right. Yeah. He, uh,

270
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:56,980
he threw off a tremendous amount
of energy. Uh, Roger Perlmutter,

271
00:16:56,981 --> 00:17:00,820
who is now the president of Merck
research labs, had this great quote,

272
00:17:00,821 --> 00:17:03,340
and he said that Lee is like of the son.

273
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:08,320
He throws off all of this is heat
and energy and he draws people.

274
00:17:08,350 --> 00:17:13,240
He's got this great gravitational pull.
He draws people into his orbit. They do,

275
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:15,460
they're stimulated,
they do a lot of their best work,

276
00:17:15,490 --> 00:17:20,140
graduate students and
postdocs. Um, but, um, uh,

277
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:25,170
it can be a little overpowering
at times as suffocating in some,

278
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:26,193
some cases

279
00:17:26,530 --> 00:17:31,330
you invoked, um, uh, uh, the context
of Gordon Moore and, and, and,

280
00:17:31,331 --> 00:17:31,720
uh,

281
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:36,550
and kind of Intel and kind of the amazing
work that was done to develop kind of

282
00:17:36,551 --> 00:17:40,720
infrastructure, kind of these
fundamental tools or, or, um, uh,

283
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:44,860
you know, components that kind of
raised the whole field. And, and I,

284
00:17:44,861 --> 00:17:49,770
I think that that analogy kind of runs
true, uh, uh, to the work hood. Did,

285
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:54,780
um, you know, kind of as, as you
kind of think through, um, the, uh,

286
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:59,850
the way that the various instruments
that could develop unlocked biology.

287
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:02,040
Do you feel like we're, we're, um,

288
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:06,430
we're seeing the full vision
of what Lee had had, um,

289
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:08,640
envisioned all the way back then today?

290
00:18:08,641 --> 00:18:11,650
Or do you still feel like there's
a lot more, uh, to be unlocked?

291
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:13,980
Clearly we're seeing sequencing and
all that sort of stuff, but there,

292
00:18:13,981 --> 00:18:17,160
are there other components of the vision
that you heard from him that we're

293
00:18:17,161 --> 00:18:21,870
still waiting to see? Absolutely.
Yes. We're still in the early days.

294
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:25,070
And just for a little bit of historical
context, I mean, you know this,

295
00:18:25,071 --> 00:18:26,410
you've read the book,
but it,

296
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:31,140
when hood was a really emerging on
the faculty at Caltech in the 70s,

297
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:32,690
uh, the first, uh,

298
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:37,730
manual DNA sequencing techniques were
being developed and these were slow,

299
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:40,230
tedious processes.

300
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:44,460
A graduate student would spend his or
her entire graduate school career and get

301
00:18:44,461 --> 00:18:48,510
a phd based on determining
the sequence of just one gene.

302
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:53,640
So five years, you determine the sequence
for making something like insulin.

303
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:55,380
Right now,

304
00:18:55,410 --> 00:18:59,490
today you can scrape off a skin
cell and sequence the entire genome,

305
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:03,570
the entire 3 billion bases
that are, are you in me? Um,

306
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:07,770
in seconds? Well the A, an
entire genome and say a day,

307
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:12,660
but like that gene would happen in
a split second. So, you know, the,

308
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:15,660
He v envisioned,
um,

309
00:19:15,810 --> 00:19:20,060
automation coming to
biology at a time when, um,

310
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:24,300
the tools were very rudimentary in manual.
And furthermore,

311
00:19:24,301 --> 00:19:27,780
there was a technophobic
attitude within biology.

312
00:19:27,810 --> 00:19:32,580
There were people in biology
saw themselves as kind of
like high priests and we

313
00:19:32,581 --> 00:19:36,960
don't really do this sort of thing
that we don't make widgets or tools.

314
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:41,320
That's the work of industry.
Um, and so hood, uh,

315
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:44,970
came in and said, no, we need to do both.

316
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:50,180
We need to develop better tools to
ask bigger and deeper questions.

317
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:54,990
We need to gather new kinds of data
and turn it into a bigger kind of

318
00:19:54,991 --> 00:19:57,750
information science.
And he,

319
00:19:57,990 --> 00:20:01,440
he saw not just DNA sequencing but,
uh,

320
00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:06,530
other layers of information being
crucially important to like thoroughly

321
00:20:06,871 --> 00:20:11,250
understanding the whole organism.
So, uh, he, he developed a,

322
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:15,550
what they call them micro chemical
facility at Caltech where they would, uh,

323
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:19,890
they sequence proteins.
They synthesize proteins,

324
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:25,160
sequence DNA and synthesize DNA for
instruments working in harmony that would,

325
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:31,440
um, read and write in the
language of life so to speak.

326
00:20:31,770 --> 00:20:36,630
And by looking at the different layers
of information you could see, um,

327
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:37,050
you know,

328
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:42,050
how things go awry and become diseased
in a much more granular fashion than,

329
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:47,960
than you could before.
You know, certainly, uh,

330
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:52,990
sitting inside of Google kind of, uh, you
know, those four components. Uh, you know,

331
00:20:52,991 --> 00:20:57,310
you see some of, some of which have have
totally transformed the industry. Uh,

332
00:20:57,340 --> 00:21:00,220
you know, it feels like there's
still a, you know, more to come in.

333
00:21:00,221 --> 00:21:03,730
It's certainly from a, from a
Google perspective, the role that,

334
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:08,170
the amount of data that's produced
from that set of instruments, uh,

335
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,140
you know,
is clearly profound and,

336
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:12,430
and would suggest that
there's other infrastructure,

337
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:16,300
other tool sets that need to be built
to manage it and help get to that

338
00:21:16,301 --> 00:21:17,680
underlying ability or that,

339
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:22,240
that ultimate goal of a reading and
writing in the language of biology.

340
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:24,520
How much of that part of it have you seen?

341
00:21:24,521 --> 00:21:27,760
We hood kind of focus on having
done all the instruments, you know,

342
00:21:27,761 --> 00:21:31,120
thinking about, okay, oh, there's all this
data that's coming off the instruments.

343
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:34,570
You know, I, I think you referenced a
couple of things that he was doing, but,

344
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:37,360
but where, you know, where
did that research take you as,

345
00:21:37,361 --> 00:21:40,480
as you're thinking through now that these
instruments kind of exist or parts of

346
00:21:40,481 --> 00:21:42,040
them exist? You know, what's next?

347
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:47,350
Well, it's a great question because you
know, you can argue that we haven't yet,

348
00:21:47,410 --> 00:21:47,760
uh,

349
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:52,760
reap the dividends of the human genome
project and genomics or information rich

350
00:21:53,951 --> 00:21:56,680
biology whenever you'd like to call it.
Um,

351
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:00,190
because I think we're still
very much in the early days. Uh,

352
00:22:00,191 --> 00:22:02,830
we're learning that biology is,

353
00:22:02,890 --> 00:22:06,010
even as you peel back more
and more layers of the onion,

354
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:10,720
it gets more and more complicated.
So the gene sequence, as you know,

355
00:22:10,721 --> 00:22:12,790
it's not absolutely deterministic.

356
00:22:13,090 --> 00:22:18,010
Just because you have a
genetic abnormality doesn't
necessarily lead directly to

357
00:22:18,011 --> 00:22:21,700
the path of disease. There are
other points at which, you know,

358
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:24,660
proteins, cells, you know,

359
00:22:24,670 --> 00:22:29,560
you need to get a more full picture and
we're not there yet, uh, of uh, and,

360
00:22:29,561 --> 00:22:32,050
and so there are efforts, um, in fact,

361
00:22:32,051 --> 00:22:36,520
Google's baseline project as one to
try to, you know, better integrate,

362
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:37,390
um,

363
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:42,370
these multiple layers of information
from genes to protein cells,

364
00:22:42,490 --> 00:22:46,750
but also your observable phenotype
that's in your electronic health records.

365
00:22:47,010 --> 00:22:50,170
And we have some challenges
with electronic health
records in this country and

366
00:22:50,171 --> 00:22:53,260
interoperability getting
different data sets to,

367
00:22:53,410 --> 00:22:57,050
to line up and talk to
each other. So that's, um,

368
00:22:57,670 --> 00:22:59,500
that's gonna take years to two words.

369
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:03,560
True. I remember in the book
you described a era of all, uh,

370
00:23:03,561 --> 00:23:06,280
which was a company that
already has a company that, uh,

371
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:10,280
hood had chest I think got launched
maybe just as the book was, uh,

372
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:14,120
coming to press. Any news about
that? Anything that you've heard or,

373
00:23:14,121 --> 00:23:17,810
or cause it seemed like that was starting
to get to some of these, uh, you know,

374
00:23:17,811 --> 00:23:20,660
questions around phenotype and how to
tie all this stuff together with the

375
00:23:20,661 --> 00:23:21,740
genetic underpinnings.

376
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:25,200
Yeah. So for those unfamiliar,
Arivale is accompany.

377
00:23:25,290 --> 00:23:28,820
It started another startup company
that hood has gotten involved with, uh,

378
00:23:28,821 --> 00:23:32,150
and it's trying to bring about
what he calls scientific wellness.

379
00:23:32,630 --> 00:23:36,830
So this is a big data
approach to your health.

380
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:41,660
They start with, uh, people see having
their genome, their full genome sequenced,

381
00:23:42,030 --> 00:23:46,610
uh, but, uh, once, cause that's all you
need, that's static set of information.

382
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:50,780
But then periodically say once
a quarter you'll get your money,

383
00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:54,340
you'll give a blood sample
or spit, um, and uh,

384
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:57,170
that will be analyzed for the metabolites.

385
00:23:57,410 --> 00:24:02,410
So what are the key metabolites that are
showing up in greater concentration or

386
00:24:03,981 --> 00:24:06,740
another in your blood that
might be sending something awry?

387
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:11,840
A signal of disease perhaps? Uh,
they also sequence your microbiome.

388
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:16,640
We're learning a lot because of the
tool that enables us to sequence all the

389
00:24:16,641 --> 00:24:20,270
microbes in say, a stool sample. You can,

390
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:25,520
you can get a sense of, uh, one's health,
a snapshot. It's constantly changing,

391
00:24:25,670 --> 00:24:25,971
right?

392
00:24:25,971 --> 00:24:30,170
Because the composition of your microbes
is influenced by your environment. Um,

393
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:32,540
so, um, by,

394
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:37,580
by gathering what he calls
a dense dynamic data cloud.

395
00:24:37,870 --> 00:24:42,440
So starts with your
genome, the Metabolome, the
proteins, the proteome, uh,

396
00:24:42,470 --> 00:24:43,640
the microbiome.

397
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:48,400
All of these ohmic levels of
information get combined and,

398
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:51,440
and hopefully by gathering all of this,

399
00:24:52,130 --> 00:24:54,530
they can see,
say,

400
00:24:54,531 --> 00:24:58,610
a sign of an early
warning sign of disease.

401
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:03,760
So do you have something that kind of
looks like it might be prediabetes heading

402
00:25:04,041 --> 00:25:08,780
on the road toward, um, you know, a
more classic measurement of disease,

403
00:25:08,781 --> 00:25:11,990
like your hemoglobin a, one
c being too high, you're,

404
00:25:11,991 --> 00:25:14,510
you're unable to control your blood sugar.
Can we see,

405
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:18,770
can we see it by gathering
all of this information,

406
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:22,220
there's going to be a lot of noise.
Can we find that signal?

407
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:24,740
Can we apply computers to,

408
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:29,800
to identify disease at a point at
which we can intervene and potentially

409
00:25:30,771 --> 00:25:35,180
correct, uh, before it's too late?
And so they, they've layered in a,

410
00:25:35,181 --> 00:25:39,670
what they call a wellness coach. So
someone who works with, you know,

411
00:25:39,710 --> 00:25:44,210
a computational biologist looks
at the data and says, you know,

412
00:25:44,211 --> 00:25:45,920
I think there might be a signal here,

413
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:50,660
tells that to a coach who is not exactly,
you know,

414
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:54,740
sort of like a nurse practitioner
who says, you know, Krishna,

415
00:25:55,250 --> 00:25:58,520
I'm seeing something kind of worrisome
with your blood sugar. You know,

416
00:25:58,521 --> 00:26:03,020
you might want to lay off the ice
cream before bed. Um, and, and if so,

417
00:26:03,050 --> 00:26:07,910
can we get, when we check a quarter
after, can we see like that, that,

418
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:08,091
uh,

419
00:26:08,091 --> 00:26:12,950
that molecular perturbation
has disappeared and you
no longer look like you're

420
00:26:12,951 --> 00:26:17,420
on the path to prediabetes.
Now this is really pretty exciting stuff,

421
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:20,630
but, um, it's not exactly being done.

422
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:25,550
It's not done in the traditional context
of randomized controlled trials that

423
00:26:25,551 --> 00:26:27,260
are the way at which, you know, we,

424
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:31,790
we try to control for all the variables
that might be influencing our health.

425
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,600
So there's plenty of skeptics
out there who say, you know,

426
00:26:35,930 --> 00:26:40,550
this is kind of interesting, but it's
not giving us definitive proof that, um,

427
00:26:41,090 --> 00:26:44,280
that what you're doing is really working.
Right.

428
00:26:45,450 --> 00:26:49,380
Um, I did want to get back
a little bit to the, uh,

429
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:53,520
the Seattle and kind of the various
sorts of geographies. You see. Um, I'll,

430
00:26:53,521 --> 00:26:56,490
I'll turn to the audience in a little
bit and ask a couple questions. So, uh,

431
00:26:56,910 --> 00:26:59,820
Qsen thoughts up here in a
moment, but, uh, but you know,

432
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:03,900
on your website you mentioned that you've
been through a two bosses and one and

433
00:27:03,901 --> 00:27:07,410
a half booms I think in the,
in the biotech sector. Um,

434
00:27:07,650 --> 00:27:10,280
and I would assume that we're kind
of still in the middle of a boom, uh,

435
00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:13,560
from your perspective. So would maybe be
curious your perspective on, you know,

436
00:27:13,561 --> 00:27:17,270
where we are in a cycle here, having
lived through a few yourself. Um,

437
00:27:17,310 --> 00:27:20,370
but I'd also be really curious,
I mean, you mentioned, you
know, there was a world,

438
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:23,880
uh, when you started your career
where Microsoft and Boeing,

439
00:27:23,881 --> 00:27:28,340
where the big industries in
Seattle, where are things today, uh,

440
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:29,370
in Seattle and then,

441
00:27:29,371 --> 00:27:32,160
and then how are you seeing the various
geographies that you spend time in?

442
00:27:32,161 --> 00:27:35,930
The big ones that I think of are of
course Seattle, the bay area, you know,

443
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:38,310
San Diego, New York, Boston.

444
00:27:38,311 --> 00:27:40,610
Do you spend time in all of these
different geographies and what,

445
00:27:40,650 --> 00:27:43,640
what are you seeing since you kind
of perhaps more than most have,

446
00:27:43,641 --> 00:27:46,630
have a spectrum of,
uh, insight across, uh,

447
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:48,750
what various companies
are up to in academics?

448
00:27:49,170 --> 00:27:53,010
Yeah. Yeah. So first question
about the boob. Um, yeah, I mean,

449
00:27:53,011 --> 00:27:56,840
we reached a peak there
in the summer of 2015, um,

450
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:01,170
where there was, you know, kind of
a, a record number of FDA approvals.

451
00:28:01,171 --> 00:28:04,900
There was a record amount of venture
funding. The stock markets were,

452
00:28:04,901 --> 00:28:08,580
we're all riding high. Um, and uh,

453
00:28:08,581 --> 00:28:12,570
then came Martin Shkreli and
some drug pricing controversies,

454
00:28:12,571 --> 00:28:16,640
which scared some investors
thought maybe, uh, the,

455
00:28:16,770 --> 00:28:20,820
the presidential election will go some
direction that might clamp down on drug

456
00:28:20,821 --> 00:28:24,780
prices. So it, it fell
down for a while. Um,

457
00:28:24,930 --> 00:28:26,790
now in the last this year,

458
00:28:26,850 --> 00:28:31,850
things have rebounded to some extent
and we're now back on track again toward

459
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:35,190
pretty close to a record
number of FDA approvals.

460
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:38,240
There are some very exciting
drugs, which you know of. So I,

461
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:42,240
I'm pretty optimistic
that, uh, things are, uh,

462
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:45,670
exciting things are happening
with, with regularity. Um,

463
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:50,700
a lot of it here in the Boston area
now to, uh, to the geography question.

464
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:55,530
I mean, Seattle has been utterly changed
in the 16 years that I've been there.

465
00:28:55,590 --> 00:28:58,740
The biggest one being the
emergence of Amazon. Um,

466
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:03,750
they now have about 40,000 employees in
the city of Seattle and they've plopped

467
00:29:03,751 --> 00:29:08,490
them all just north of downtown. So
there's a tremendous amount of, you know,

468
00:29:08,491 --> 00:29:12,870
bars and restaurants and you know,
condos and street activity that,

469
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:17,160
that wasn't there and kind of a
previously rundown part of town. Uh,

470
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:21,330
it's brought a lot of growth,
a lot of good economic growth,

471
00:29:21,331 --> 00:29:23,040
but also some growing pains,

472
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:27,960
traffic and housing prices
as familiar story to many,

473
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:33,000
uh, tech clusters. Um,
but, um, as for biotech,

474
00:29:33,001 --> 00:29:34,110
I mean, I, um,

475
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:39,230
I remain based in Seattle and there's a
terrific base of research there at the

476
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:42,370
Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center
and the University of Washington in a few

477
00:29:42,371 --> 00:29:43,810
other nonprofits.

478
00:29:43,930 --> 00:29:48,850
The Gates Foundation is there and
leading the charge on infectious disease.

479
00:29:49,290 --> 00:29:50,350
Uh, but, um,

480
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:54,670
I get to Boston and San
Francisco and the most, uh,

481
00:29:54,730 --> 00:29:57,850
because these are the
top two biotech clusters.

482
00:29:58,060 --> 00:30:03,060
So I'm meeting with companies
and scientists and investors
in those two places

483
00:30:03,071 --> 00:30:07,780
quite a bit. Um, San Diego as
well. New York once in a while.

484
00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:12,740
Um, the, the way biotech has
grown as an industry, we, um,

485
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:18,120
it does tend to concentrate by geography
around great academic research centers.

486
00:30:20,550 --> 00:30:22,870
Uh, great hospitals. Um,

487
00:30:22,930 --> 00:30:26,620
and then the money in the entrepreneurs
and then all the service providers,

488
00:30:26,650 --> 00:30:30,450
all of the consultants, the law
firms, the, everything that you need,

489
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:32,230
the regulatory affairs specialists,

490
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:36,700
everything that you need kind
of needs to be in, in one place.

491
00:30:36,730 --> 00:30:38,980
So that's the way it has evolved.

492
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:42,450
Let me see if there's any
questions from the audience here,

493
00:30:43,270 --> 00:30:44,930
wondering if you looked at any of the new,
uh,

494
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:47,730
diesel therapies that
are coming out of that.

495
00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:51,160
Yes,
yes.

496
00:30:51,270 --> 00:30:54,420
So, uh, for those unfamiliar on Novartis,

497
00:30:54,450 --> 00:30:58,890
one FDA approval just a couple of
weeks ago for the first, uh, car t, uh,

498
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:01,500
immunotherapy, um, in this, uh,

499
00:31:01,530 --> 00:31:05,960
this is a therapy in which patient
with cancer blood cancer, uh,

500
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:10,020
has white blood cells withdrawn.
They go off to a company lab,

501
00:31:10,050 --> 00:31:14,790
they use some gene therapy to reprogram
the receptors to recognize a specific

502
00:31:14,791 --> 00:31:18,780
marker on cancer cells. And
then they reinfused those, uh,

503
00:31:18,870 --> 00:31:23,130
those t cells to go in and
kill the cancer. Um, and the,

504
00:31:23,131 --> 00:31:27,990
they have seen extraordinary results
in small groups of patients with blood

505
00:31:27,991 --> 00:31:28,824
cancers,

506
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:33,860
something like 80% complete remission
rates in kids with a acute lymphoblastic

507
00:31:35,581 --> 00:31:40,440
leukemia. So, Eh, this is a very
exciting development. I mean,

508
00:31:40,441 --> 00:31:45,240
we just don't see 80% complete
response rates, uh, in, you know,

509
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:50,270
serious cancers with traditional small
molecule or targeted antibody therapies.

510
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:54,090
So, uh, and furthermore, we're beginning,

511
00:31:54,270 --> 00:31:57,900
we're starting to gather the longterm
followup data you need to say, yes,

512
00:31:57,901 --> 00:32:00,600
this is actually lasting.
Uh,

513
00:32:00,690 --> 00:32:04,970
so very exciting moment. Um, and uh,

514
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:07,380
there are lots of La,
there's been an incredible boom,

515
00:32:07,410 --> 00:32:11,700
this is part of the story of the last
five years is that immunotherapy has

516
00:32:11,701 --> 00:32:14,130
really come to the fore in cancer.

517
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:18,900
This is no longer like a
fringe science idea. Um, it's,

518
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:23,610
it's the main stage of cancer.
Every company that's in cancer,

519
00:32:23,850 --> 00:32:28,850
every cancer center is focused on how
can we redirect that power of the immune

520
00:32:29,911 --> 00:32:32,640
system to go after the cancer cells.

521
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:36,480
You actually have a feature on
your website Timmerman report.

522
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:41,620
If our call that was a review of
every company in the Immuno space done

523
00:32:41,961 --> 00:32:43,700
alphabetically. If I
had gone, it was like,

524
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:49,070
it was pages and pages of companies and I
was like, this is amazing. Uh, you know,

525
00:32:49,071 --> 00:32:52,240
how did you put that together? That
seemed like just an uh, you know,

526
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:56,360
superhuman level of effort to put
that amount of um, uh, data together.

527
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:58,040
And I was looking through it and thinking,
oh my gosh,

528
00:32:58,041 --> 00:33:02,260
like it's just the only way to organize
this is, is alphabetically. It is.

529
00:33:02,310 --> 00:33:04,490
Cause every, everyday there's
a new company in this space.

530
00:33:04,610 --> 00:33:09,610
It really is hard to keep up with
all of the scientific approaches,

531
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:13,850
all the companies getting
money. Um, so yeah,

532
00:33:13,851 --> 00:33:18,650
I found myself scratching my head and
saying, how can I get a handle on this?

533
00:33:18,651 --> 00:33:22,310
So why don't I just go a toZ and try
to find as many companies as I could.

534
00:33:22,311 --> 00:33:26,330
And there was something like 180 companies
and I just wrote short profiles of

535
00:33:26,331 --> 00:33:30,090
each one of them back to back
along with some links to, you know,

536
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:34,340
primary sources where he might be able
to gather more specific information on

537
00:33:34,341 --> 00:33:37,430
each and almost as many
immuno therapy companies.

538
00:33:37,431 --> 00:33:39,770
Is there a video sharing companies?
I think.

539
00:33:46,970 --> 00:33:50,650
Sure. Two quick ones.
One just about leave it.

540
00:33:51,310 --> 00:33:55,090
I'm just curious that the
back in the day,

541
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:58,910
do you think any part
of that is the conflict?

542
00:33:59,990 --> 00:34:04,470
What was rid of the
traditional, you know, science?

543
00:34:05,530 --> 00:34:06,363
That's a

544
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:10,590
a great question. And
absolutely, yes. So Hud, um,

545
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:15,650
because of the scope of this
vision as it was really,

546
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:16,430
uh,

547
00:34:16,430 --> 00:34:21,430
as he was bringing in the resources
and the people to make it happen,

548
00:34:21,710 --> 00:34:23,290
his lab grew.
Uh,

549
00:34:23,330 --> 00:34:27,480
he started colonizing more
and more space on campus. Uh,

550
00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:29,570
he was the chairman and you know,

551
00:34:29,571 --> 00:34:34,571
he saw like all of this as being part of
his grand quest didn't necessarily pay

552
00:34:35,091 --> 00:34:40,070
a lot of attention to what the small
science, uh, people in the faculty,

553
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:44,690
um, what their priorities
were. Um, and so he,

554
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:46,490
he ended up,
it,

555
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:51,780
it evolves when you have 60 or 80 people
in a lab and the guy down the hall has

556
00:34:52,731 --> 00:34:57,260
five or six graduate students working on
some very narrow, esoteric problem. Uh,

557
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:58,910
you know,
it's,

558
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:03,770
it challenged the whole culture of
the way caltech operated or really any

559
00:35:03,771 --> 00:35:05,240
university for that matter.

560
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:09,480
The principal investigator led model with
five or six graduate students has been

561
00:35:09,481 --> 00:35:12,110
irrelevant for a long time and it's
given us a lot of good science.

562
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:16,730
So people in the small science world
looked at this and thought, what is this?

563
00:35:16,731 --> 00:35:21,710
I mean, how can you even adequately
supervise these people are, who are they?

564
00:35:21,711 --> 00:35:24,740
Are they tenure track faculty or are they,
you know,

565
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:27,890
are they pro like employees
of like a little copany?

566
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:32,000
Do we actually have like a little company
now inside of Caltech? Um, it was,

567
00:35:32,270 --> 00:35:34,050
it was strange people and,
and,

568
00:35:34,051 --> 00:35:39,051
and it clashed with a lot of the identity
of the Cole Caltech really saw itself

569
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:42,920
as this elite institution
doing these rarefied yeah.

570
00:35:42,970 --> 00:35:43,803
Things

571
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:54,970
after and after he was at Caltech,
you know,

572
00:35:54,990 --> 00:35:59,280
we've talked before about journalism
been disrupted by various changes.

573
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:02,310
Do you see academia that he
says being disrupted? I mean,

574
00:36:02,311 --> 00:36:06,690
obviously the Dapps it's pretty
smart people, but only to like, oh,

575
00:36:07,690 --> 00:36:12,570
let's see. In terms of academic
straddling that line in biology between,

576
00:36:12,690 --> 00:36:17,370
you know, the large invention type
laboratories or the source that you have,

577
00:36:17,490 --> 00:36:20,850
you're in Cambridge versus
what was more classic

578
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:23,940
elite investigators.

579
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:29,360
I would say that these two forms
can now coexist more easily.

580
00:36:29,850 --> 00:36:34,320
Um, so, uh, small science
is still alive and well.

581
00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:39,390
Well, I mean, it has, it has, it's,
the model is still intact. I mean,

582
00:36:39,391 --> 00:36:43,410
there are challenges to it.
Uh, with, uh, the NIH budget,

583
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,920
I'm constantly under pressure.
Um,

584
00:36:46,290 --> 00:36:50,220
but big science has carved out
more of a place for itself.

585
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:54,270
Big Project driven that's a little more
industry like occurs at a place like the

586
00:36:54,271 --> 00:36:59,130
brode. Uh, that's fortunate enough
to attract philanthropy, uh, that,

587
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:04,160
that can look a little further out at a
longterm goal than say your classic Aro

588
00:37:04,930 --> 00:37:06,210
one NIH grant,

589
00:37:06,211 --> 00:37:11,080
which is more on a three to five year
timeframe to show some results. Um,

590
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:15,480
you know, I mean, but there's a lot of
tension still between the two. I mean,

591
00:37:15,481 --> 00:37:19,500
there's the whole data sharing
question. Um, you know,

592
00:37:19,501 --> 00:37:22,860
a lot of principal investigators,
I mean, they make their, uh,

593
00:37:23,070 --> 00:37:27,020
their name and their field by getting
published in science and nature and, and,

594
00:37:27,110 --> 00:37:28,510
and not by,
you know,

595
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:33,830
dumping all their raw data out in public
databases for other scientists to,

596
00:37:34,070 --> 00:37:36,120
you know,
gather and learn from in real time.

597
00:37:36,390 --> 00:37:40,740
So we have a t a serious time
lag problem in academic science.

598
00:37:41,130 --> 00:37:41,963
Now,

599
00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:46,170
big science has still
has that cultural issue,

600
00:37:46,171 --> 00:37:49,470
but I think to a lesser degree, I'd be
curious to hear your thoughts on that,

601
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:54,160
Krishna. But you, you know, you
see some cases of uh, you know,

602
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:55,980
bigger institutions,

603
00:37:56,040 --> 00:38:00,700
I think they might be more inclined to
lead on this and say, you know, like, uh,

604
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:04,050
Daniel Macarthur over at the brode
institute, some of you may know he's a,

605
00:38:04,051 --> 00:38:09,000
he's got this database for
exomes 60,000 or even more, uh,

606
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:09,990
uh,

607
00:38:09,990 --> 00:38:14,990
collections of big datasets that from
each 60,000 individuals who have had scans

608
00:38:16,141 --> 00:38:20,370
done on the 2% of their genome
that makes code for proteins.

609
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:22,770
That's pretty useful. And, um,

610
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:27,860
he is actually able to advance his career
by putting this out in the open and

611
00:38:28,531 --> 00:38:31,560
then letting other people
share in that resource.

612
00:38:31,770 --> 00:38:34,770
So I think we're beginning to see some,

613
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:40,270
some cultural changes between small
and big science, but you know,

614
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:44,350
change is hard. It
takes a long time. Yeah.

615
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:48,960
Is it a piggy back on that last question,
if you can look in your crystal ball

616
00:38:51,390 --> 00:38:56,390
looking into the future and biotech
based on what you know about Seattle?

617
00:38:56,491 --> 00:39:00,870
No. And you said the mindscape is
fundamentally change because of Amazon.

618
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:06,150
Do you think biotech could work?
Is moving to Seattle,

619
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:10,920
San Francisco, Boston,
Cambridge are definitely helps,
but we're becoming crowded,

620
00:39:11,550 --> 00:39:14,880
very expensive.
Is there a room there?

621
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:19,680
Is there a willingness there to sort of
expand beyond Amazon into buying tech?

622
00:39:19,681 --> 00:39:21,650
Or do you think it's
going to stay the Hans,

623
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:23,730
you're going to stay in San Francisco?
Cambridge,

624
00:39:24,210 --> 00:39:29,210
I think a Boston and San Francisco are
a head and shoulders above the other

625
00:39:30,061 --> 00:39:33,180
clusters and will likely remain that way,
um,

626
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:36,650
as the rest of our lifetimes.
Um,

627
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:39,090
there's so much historical,
uh,

628
00:39:39,150 --> 00:39:44,070
momentum behind the basic research to
clinical care, the venture capital,

629
00:39:44,071 --> 00:39:48,030
the history of entrepreneurship,
that human capital pool that's here.

630
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:52,080
I'm in a place like Seattle.
You have a few pieces of the puzzle,

631
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:56,730
but not all of them. Um, you have the
basic research that's world class.

632
00:39:57,060 --> 00:40:00,240
Um, but, uh, you know,
I didn't mention this,

633
00:40:00,241 --> 00:40:02,740
but when I started covering the
industry, uh, there was, uh,

634
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:07,020
a company called Immunex,
uh, which, uh, developed, uh,

635
00:40:07,050 --> 00:40:10,770
the drug called Enbrel,
which was still to this day,

636
00:40:10,771 --> 00:40:14,040
the 20 years later is one of the top
five bestselling drugs in the world.

637
00:40:14,190 --> 00:40:18,030
It's really a major step forward
for rheumatoid arthritis.

638
00:40:18,270 --> 00:40:22,880
Other drugs have come forward since
then, biologically enabled. And um,

639
00:40:22,950 --> 00:40:26,370
the company wasn't able
to hold on to that.

640
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:28,440
It ended up getting acquired by Amgen.

641
00:40:28,730 --> 00:40:31,920
A lot of the assets and
people moved elsewhere.

642
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:37,050
And so Seattle is like a lot of these
other hubs of biotech that doesn't,

643
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:41,000
it has some aspects of
what you need. But, uh,

644
00:40:41,190 --> 00:40:42,980
in this case it doesn't have the,

645
00:40:42,981 --> 00:40:47,250
the pool of sales and marketing people
or executive tailored that venture

646
00:40:47,251 --> 00:40:51,810
capitalists typically what to
see before they see new things.

647
00:40:52,070 --> 00:40:56,490
Um, and you have that in a
place like Boston, Cambridge.

648
00:40:56,790 --> 00:40:58,560
Um, so, you know,

649
00:40:59,610 --> 00:41:03,540
I'm sure Krisha has no shortage of people
that you can imagine running startup

650
00:41:03,541 --> 00:41:07,950
companies here in Boston. Yeah, yeah.
We're surrounded by them. I, I'm curious,

651
00:41:07,951 --> 00:41:12,870
I mean, if you were to zoom out a level,
um, and look at the biotech industry, uh,

652
00:41:12,871 --> 00:41:15,390
over the time you've been
covering it, you know, ah,

653
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:19,910
there's the gigantic a Pharma
entities, uh, you know,

654
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:23,800
that we all know the Pfizers, the
Roche, the Mercks, uh, you know, um,

655
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:27,240
there's the small companies that
we finance and that, uh, you know,

656
00:41:27,241 --> 00:41:31,620
aren't doing exciting, a new science.
Maybe some of them are public, usually,

657
00:41:31,650 --> 00:41:34,070
you know, uh, call it, you
know, billion are under

658
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:34,910
sort of market caps.

659
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:38,280
And then we have kind of this
interesting array of companies, um,

660
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:42,680
like vertex cell gene. I mean
Gilliad I mean, these have become,

661
00:41:42,681 --> 00:41:46,970
these are companies I think we've seen
go from kind of startups to kind of,

662
00:41:47,390 --> 00:41:50,000
you know,
small midsize companies to like,

663
00:41:50,001 --> 00:41:51,500
they're becoming pretty large companies.

664
00:41:51,501 --> 00:41:56,150
And some of them have done deals that
are billion dollar acquisition is $1

665
00:41:56,150 --> 00:41:58,790
billion deals and they can kind of do
it without breaking too much of a sweat.

666
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:01,520
Uh, you know, if you were
to dial the clock forward,

667
00:42:01,521 --> 00:42:04,190
just given the context you've had
over all these years, you know,

668
00:42:04,210 --> 00:42:06,040
what do you think happens
with those companies?

669
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:09,900
You think they get acquired
by the big entities? Do you
think that they, you know,

670
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:12,700
grow up a lot of them kind
of, um, and I'm sure you've,

671
00:42:12,730 --> 00:42:16,980
you've been on the receiving end of all
of their pitches as they kind of to talk

672
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:19,370
to you about various announcements.
They all have kind of,

673
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:22,130
I think the framework of, look,
we're going to be the next mark.

674
00:42:22,131 --> 00:42:26,270
We're going to be the next, uh, you know,
Genentech, Roche. Do you believe it?

675
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:29,590
Do you believe that those companies
are kind of grow into the next, uh,

676
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:31,340
big behemoths are, you know, what do you,

677
00:42:31,341 --> 00:42:33,890
what do you think
happens with those folks?

678
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:38,550
You know, it's a great question. I
think maybe it's a minority of the time.

679
00:42:38,580 --> 00:42:42,030
Maybe one fourth of the
time those visions are,

680
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:47,060
are realized by a company that gets
over the Hump and develops a new drug.

681
00:42:47,550 --> 00:42:47,821
I mean,

682
00:42:47,821 --> 00:42:52,590
just getting one drug over the finish
line as an FDA approved product.

683
00:42:52,860 --> 00:42:54,150
And, and, you know,

684
00:42:54,330 --> 00:42:58,620
really helping patients and
getting adequately reimbursed
and making good money.

685
00:42:58,621 --> 00:43:03,130
I mean, very, very few companies
ever get through that funnel, um,

686
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:08,320
and even fewer can do it twice. So, um,

687
00:43:08,580 --> 00:43:08,971
you know,

688
00:43:08,971 --> 00:43:13,230
this is that the company down the
street Alnylam pharmaceuticals is a good

689
00:43:13,231 --> 00:43:18,210
example. So they've got RNA interference,
gene silencing technology. They, they did,

690
00:43:18,211 --> 00:43:22,250
they locked up a lot of IP early
on. They raised a lot of money, uh,

691
00:43:22,270 --> 00:43:27,120
broadened smart people and 15 years
later they just now have the phase three

692
00:43:27,121 --> 00:43:31,500
validating data necessary for
treating one rare disease.

693
00:43:31,910 --> 00:43:36,030
Uh, which looks like that's going to be
a drug now they can start making money.

694
00:43:36,410 --> 00:43:36,990
Um,

695
00:43:36,990 --> 00:43:41,970
but that really is not enough for
them to become an enduring entity.

696
00:43:42,090 --> 00:43:47,040
They need to do it at least one or two
more times to get diversified like a

697
00:43:47,041 --> 00:43:48,660
Celgene or a Gilliad.

698
00:43:48,810 --> 00:43:52,650
Even Gilly and Celgene have their
diversification challenges. You, you,

699
00:43:52,940 --> 00:43:55,280
you look at how they make
their money and often it's,

700
00:43:55,281 --> 00:43:58,130
it's one big thing you
that does it for the

701
00:43:58,330 --> 00:44:01,450
even, I mean, just, I mean, just to call
it out. I mean, even for the cell genes,

702
00:44:01,451 --> 00:44:04,020
the Gilliads, um, the vertexes,

703
00:44:04,090 --> 00:44:07,480
I mean these are companies
that are actually pretty
big. Um, but to your point,

704
00:44:07,481 --> 00:44:10,150
like they still ha they're
not fully diversified.

705
00:44:10,810 --> 00:44:13,510
And I guess that's maybe that's one
of the questions like, uh, you know,

706
00:44:13,511 --> 00:44:15,190
there's the,
there's the Alnylam is,

707
00:44:15,191 --> 00:44:18,490
and can they make the leap into
becoming a commercial organization?

708
00:44:18,491 --> 00:44:21,340
And that's something that, I mean,
obviously John's a phenomenal,

709
00:44:21,460 --> 00:44:24,760
phenomenal leader, you know,
uh, you have adios, similar,

710
00:44:24,761 --> 00:44:26,440
and I think you wrote an article
about this. Like, you know,

711
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:30,280
that shift in culture from being an
early stage r and d company to becoming a

712
00:44:30,281 --> 00:44:31,980
commercial organization,
that's its

713
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:36,090
own challenge. Even after you have the
successful drug that's been approved,

714
00:44:36,091 --> 00:44:38,790
can you kind of convert the company
and to a commercial organization?

715
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:43,300
When you look at these, this next level
of company is the Vertex is sell jeans.

716
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:46,080
Um, you'd Giliad's which
have like maybe a, you know,

717
00:44:46,081 --> 00:44:49,470
a small number of assets that
are producing huge revenues,

718
00:44:49,740 --> 00:44:52,350
do you think that they will be able
to get to that diversification?

719
00:44:52,351 --> 00:44:54,680
You think there's just as much risk there?
Uh,

720
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:58,950
as you see on the early
stage side of it? Yes. Um,

721
00:44:59,010 --> 00:45:03,500
I mean it's sort of like the old saying,
you know, getting to the mountain top is,

722
00:45:03,501 --> 00:45:08,310
is hard, but staying there is even
harder. Right, right. Um, you know,

723
00:45:08,430 --> 00:45:12,060
Regeneron pharmaceuticals is one good
example of a company that's now got,

724
00:45:12,090 --> 00:45:17,090
I think six approved drugs and they're
laying the foundation for genomics based

725
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:19,770
drug discovery.

726
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:22,530
Like really trying to link some of
these layers of information that I was

727
00:45:22,531 --> 00:45:27,180
talking about earlier to try to
create something sustainable,

728
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:28,980
something that can,

729
00:45:28,981 --> 00:45:33,981
with some degree of predictability and
reliability roll off a new FDA approved

730
00:45:34,501 --> 00:45:37,620
drug once every couple of years.
I mean,

731
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:42,780
I mean it's still monumentally difficult
and expensive and things are going to

732
00:45:42,781 --> 00:45:47,781
fail for reasons that you can't fully
understand even after you spent years and

733
00:45:47,791 --> 00:45:52,680
millions of dollars. Um, but, um, I,
you know, the companies that I think,

734
00:45:52,740 --> 00:45:53,101
you know,

735
00:45:53,101 --> 00:45:58,101
are able to invest in enough pieces of
the R and d puzzle are the ones likely to

736
00:46:00,090 --> 00:46:02,610
endure. Um, you know,

737
00:46:02,611 --> 00:46:05,850
I think in Alnylam and Regeneron and
these are companies that have a shot

738
00:46:05,910 --> 00:46:09,510
because of the,
the investment in the basic science,

739
00:46:09,690 --> 00:46:13,500
but often you see companies where that's
not even the intention at all. You know,

740
00:46:13,501 --> 00:46:14,100
they just,

741
00:46:14,100 --> 00:46:17,940
they take an asset out of Pfizer that
looks like it has some promise and it

742
00:46:17,941 --> 00:46:22,410
needs some focus development for maybe
10 years. And that's all the goal is,

743
00:46:22,411 --> 00:46:27,270
is to get that one drug approved,
sell it to a big Pharma Company,

744
00:46:27,330 --> 00:46:31,350
ends up dollars, reward the shareholders,
and then the management who's exhausted.

745
00:46:31,351 --> 00:46:36,150
We'll go sit on an island somewhere.
Let me see if there's any other questions.

746
00:46:36,151 --> 00:46:38,700
I've got a couple of others lined up here,
but anybody else?

747
00:46:40,430 --> 00:46:42,960
You were talking about
Seattle and Austin clusters.

748
00:46:43,940 --> 00:46:46,440
What do you see around the rest
of the world as far as centers?

749
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:52,860
It's a good question. So,
um, the UK has some, um,

750
00:46:53,070 --> 00:46:56,970
biotech infrastructure.
Germany is another, uh,

751
00:46:57,300 --> 00:46:58,470
some in Japan,

752
00:46:58,650 --> 00:47:03,650
but the vast majority of
new drug discovery and
development occurs in the u s

753
00:47:06,540 --> 00:47:09,780
uh, there, uh, you know,

754
00:47:09,781 --> 00:47:13,980
part of it I think comes back to the
decades of investment from the federal

755
00:47:13,981 --> 00:47:18,660
government, the NIH in, in creating
centers of excellence. Um, but also,

756
00:47:18,980 --> 00:47:23,160
um, you have an entrepreneurial
culture where, um, it's,

757
00:47:23,220 --> 00:47:28,220
it's okay to gamble your career on one
of these projects and maybe fail and you

758
00:47:29,111 --> 00:47:32,710
know, as long as she had, you know, don't
defraud somebody along the way. You know,

759
00:47:32,711 --> 00:47:36,370
maybe you can try again. Um,
that's part of our culture.

760
00:47:36,550 --> 00:47:41,550
We also have a stock market that is very
receptive and open to these very high

761
00:47:42,311 --> 00:47:45,600
risk, high reward propositions. Um,

762
00:47:45,620 --> 00:47:49,930
and that's not true in other
countries. Um, where, you know,

763
00:47:49,931 --> 00:47:54,070
there's a little more reticence around,
you know, losing all of your money,

764
00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:59,260
which does happen. Um, so, you know,

765
00:47:59,300 --> 00:48:01,240
we could have a longer
conversation about this, but there,

766
00:48:01,250 --> 00:48:06,250
there are special ingredients in the
United States that have enabled this to be

767
00:48:06,730 --> 00:48:09,910
the place where a lot
of this activity occurs.

768
00:48:10,090 --> 00:48:12,670
And now that's not
guaranteed to last forever.

769
00:48:12,671 --> 00:48:15,400
I mean we're doing some
things that, that, you know,

770
00:48:15,430 --> 00:48:20,290
like with immigration for instance, that,
uh, that could threaten our, our lead,

771
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:25,680
it could force some of this activity to
go elsewhere and it very well some of

772
00:48:26,021 --> 00:48:28,780
the ingredients are in place
in other countries. They could,

773
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:30,070
they'd be happy to take it.

774
00:48:30,950 --> 00:48:34,640
I know you're in town, uh, to, uh,
to do a bunch of things, but, uh,

775
00:48:34,670 --> 00:48:39,020
but as a venture capitalist I'm
obligated to ask you about, um, the, uh,

776
00:48:39,050 --> 00:48:42,350
the panel you're running later today
about how to avoid vcs and get the money

777
00:48:42,351 --> 00:48:45,890
you need, but they actually
think it's a phenomenal topic.

778
00:48:45,950 --> 00:48:49,760
I thought you were going to ask you
about your portfolio coach that's coming

779
00:48:49,761 --> 00:48:53,940
next hour. We do that offline
that there've been, um,
but you know, I, you know,

780
00:48:53,990 --> 00:48:58,010
there is kind of this interesting dynamic
developing where there are kind of a

781
00:48:58,011 --> 00:49:01,340
new sources of capital coming into biotech
and maybe it's because we're in this

782
00:49:01,341 --> 00:49:05,870
boom cycle of it. Um, but you know, I
think you've done that panel in other,

783
00:49:05,900 --> 00:49:08,960
other settings or maybe what do you,
what are you seeing kind of out there,

784
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:12,620
aside from the traditional venture
approach to financing, uh, you know,

785
00:49:12,621 --> 00:49:16,730
these risky, you know, crazy sort of
companies. Um, yeah. What, what, what,

786
00:49:16,731 --> 00:49:18,440
what other sources of
capital or are there,

787
00:49:18,530 --> 00:49:20,120
well,
I think you hit it on the head.

788
00:49:20,121 --> 00:49:22,970
The reason for this is that
biotech has had a good road.

789
00:49:23,030 --> 00:49:25,910
There were about three years in a
row where it outperformed the s,

790
00:49:25,911 --> 00:49:29,090
the s and p 500 and the
Nasdaq composite index.

791
00:49:29,330 --> 00:49:34,040
So anytime that happens you get more
money flowing in and saying, Gee,

792
00:49:34,041 --> 00:49:35,780
I'd like to out perform the market too.

793
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:41,090
And so traditional VC
has been around forever.

794
00:49:41,091 --> 00:49:45,950
And these are the folks who,
you know, they raised money
from pensions, endowments,

795
00:49:46,130 --> 00:49:49,590
uh, limited partners,
corporations, corporations. Um,

796
00:49:49,700 --> 00:49:53,810
and so they're out there raising
new funds every few years.

797
00:49:53,990 --> 00:49:58,730
That's one form, the really the dominant
long lasting form of venture capital.

798
00:49:58,731 --> 00:50:02,390
But there are all these other types out
there like corporate venture capital.

799
00:50:02,450 --> 00:50:06,410
So GV is an example where you're not out
there raising money from endowments or

800
00:50:06,411 --> 00:50:09,590
pensions. You've got some
money set aside. Generally.

801
00:50:09,620 --> 00:50:10,970
I mean they come in different flavors,

802
00:50:10,971 --> 00:50:15,530
but some money set aside from the parent
company that says we will, you know,

803
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:19,070
we will gamble some of this
money on biotech startups.

804
00:50:19,071 --> 00:50:20,300
That's just part of our mission.

805
00:50:20,510 --> 00:50:23,150
And some of them will pay off
in some won't just like any,

806
00:50:23,450 --> 00:50:28,100
any venture capital firm. Um, but
we have our reasons for doing this.

807
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:33,320
Um, then there's also this emergence
of a disease related foundations. Yes.

808
00:50:33,590 --> 00:50:34,730
So the,

809
00:50:34,731 --> 00:50:39,731
these are nonprofit groups that in many
cases have an interest in a specific

810
00:50:40,161 --> 00:50:45,140
disease area. Um, and
they fund basic research.

811
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:50,300
But I think in the last say
five to 10 years, a lot of
them have recognized, well,

812
00:50:50,390 --> 00:50:53,060
that's not good enough. So
if you're, say the Michael J.

813
00:50:53,060 --> 00:50:57,290
Fox Foundation for Parkinson's research,
um, you can invest in, you know,

814
00:50:57,291 --> 00:51:00,560
the bright researcher down the
street at Dana Farber or you know,

815
00:51:00,561 --> 00:51:02,090
Harvard medical school and that's great.

816
00:51:02,390 --> 00:51:07,010
But their work is ultimately going to
lead to a published paper in the New

817
00:51:07,010 --> 00:51:08,900
England Journal of Medicine.
And again, that's great,

818
00:51:09,080 --> 00:51:14,080
but it doesn't go all the way
to a new Parkinson's treatment.

819
00:51:14,630 --> 00:51:16,070
So how do you get there?
Well,

820
00:51:16,071 --> 00:51:20,300
maybe you could take some of your money
and make equity investments in a spinoff

821
00:51:20,301 --> 00:51:23,120
company that,
that takes that asset out of that lab.

822
00:51:23,420 --> 00:51:25,730
And so many of them have
realized, can we, you know,

823
00:51:25,731 --> 00:51:30,080
can we set up this sort of
equity investment component
within our, our charter,

824
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:35,320
the gates foundation does this for all
kinds of immunology related companies

825
00:51:35,721 --> 00:51:40,100
that may have an application for
vaccines in the developing world that the

826
00:51:40,101 --> 00:51:44,780
foundation cares about.
But it also may be useful for cancer.

827
00:51:45,410 --> 00:51:48,980
And that would be like something that
traditional vcs and corporate vcs can,

828
00:51:49,100 --> 00:51:52,500
can all get together on.
And you know, so, um,

829
00:51:52,610 --> 00:51:56,900
you're seeing disease foundations,
corporate venture funds, uh, but also, uh,

830
00:51:56,901 --> 00:52:01,090
now family offices. So this is sort of the
wealthy, the billionaire phenomenon. Uh,

831
00:52:01,130 --> 00:52:05,810
something like a Peter Teal who, uh,
you know, it says, Gee, I'd like to,

832
00:52:05,870 --> 00:52:10,550
I can start a company, a biotech company.
That's, you know, all I need is, you know,

833
00:52:10,551 --> 00:52:15,490
a bright scientists and, uh, you
know, a team of advisers. Uh,

834
00:52:15,510 --> 00:52:18,560
and what do you need, you know,
10, 20 million to, you know,

835
00:52:18,561 --> 00:52:22,010
run the next set of experiments.
Um, go, go give it a shot.

836
00:52:22,370 --> 00:52:24,800
So you got a lot of different kinds of,

837
00:52:25,220 --> 00:52:29,630
of new investing entities. I haven't
got so many more questions for you.

838
00:52:29,930 --> 00:52:32,960
Uh, but uh, but I'll, I'll
ask you them, uh, you know,

839
00:52:32,961 --> 00:52:36,820
probably in another setting like
this. Um, well thank you Luke, for,

840
00:52:36,870 --> 00:52:40,700
for taking the time to talk to us both
in the room and all the folks, uh,

841
00:52:40,730 --> 00:52:42,700
virtually here. Um, you know, you,

842
00:52:42,701 --> 00:52:45,080
you started things off by saying
that she kind of, you know,

843
00:52:45,081 --> 00:52:48,110
you could've gotten to a variety of
different areas of journalism and you kind

844
00:52:48,111 --> 00:52:51,660
of picked this area because of all the
exciting staff and people in it. Uh,

845
00:52:51,930 --> 00:52:54,530
I think your book does a
phenomenal job of describing that.

846
00:52:54,710 --> 00:52:57,960
So many books in this space, uh, are
kind of a slog to get through yours.

847
00:52:57,970 --> 00:52:58,820
It was just a joy.

848
00:52:59,030 --> 00:53:02,720
So hopefully everybody a out there and
in here gets a chance to experience that.

849
00:53:02,750 --> 00:53:06,290
I thought the audio book was
phenomenal as well, but uh, uh,

850
00:53:06,291 --> 00:53:09,980
but thank you for coming and hopefully
