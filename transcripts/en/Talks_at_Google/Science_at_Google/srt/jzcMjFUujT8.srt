1
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:07,670
Welcome everyone. Good afternoon. Oh,

2
00:00:07,671 --> 00:00:10,280
welcome to another exciting
talks at Google event.

3
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:14,990
And this is the second in our ongoing
series of speakers from us that work with

4
00:00:14,991 --> 00:00:18,680
Stanford's Center for the advanced
study in the behavioral sciences.

5
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:22,100
And so today we're very thrilled
to host Eric Klinenberg.

6
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,040
He's back to the toxic Google program.
Having Spoken,

7
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:29,060
I'm in New York a few years back as well.
And without any further ado,

8
00:00:29,061 --> 00:00:31,460
please join me in welcoming
America to Google. Thanks.

9
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:35,513
Okay.

10
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:39,490
Ah, thank you cliff. Thank you all
for being here during lunch. Um,

11
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,470
the food is really good
if you haven't had it yet,

12
00:00:41,471 --> 00:00:46,220
you probably know it better than I do,
but, um, it's, it's great to be here. Um,

13
00:00:46,330 --> 00:00:48,590
can you hear me okay? Is this fine? Um,

14
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:53,670
so typically these days when I go to
give a talk and bring up modern romance,

15
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:57,490
everyone wants to know in
advance is as z is coming.

16
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:01,330
And um, you know, look,

17
00:01:01,331 --> 00:01:03,450
when you write a book
with someone like Aziz,

18
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:06,980
you learn to play the second
fiddle. So I'm fine with that. Um,

19
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:10,450
and the answer is usually, you know,
I don't know. He could show up.

20
00:01:10,451 --> 00:01:13,990
So if anybody comes through this
door in the next few minutes just,

21
00:01:13,991 --> 00:01:17,240
well let's all look and see if it
turns out to be as disease. Um,

22
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:20,380
it would be a little bit of a stretch
for him because he's hosting Saturday

23
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:22,240
night,
Saturday night live this weekend.

24
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:25,480
You might've heard that it's the
the day after the inauguration.

25
00:01:25,481 --> 00:01:27,610
So it's a high pressure
gig. Let's say. Oh nope.

26
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:31,560
It's not as easy as well the children
next time someone comes in we'll,

27
00:01:31,561 --> 00:01:34,720
I'll look and we'll see if it's
disease. It might be as, okay.

28
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:36,670
What I want to do today is actually,

29
00:01:36,671 --> 00:01:40,720
I'm not talking exclusively about modern
romance, as interesting as that is,

30
00:01:40,721 --> 00:01:45,250
I want to talk a little bit more generally
about the sociology of connection,

31
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:49,950
some patterns that are worth
sharing. Um, and um, and I,

32
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:51,040
and I want to do it by,

33
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:55,450
by talking to you both about this book I
wrote a few years ago called going solo

34
00:01:55,570 --> 00:02:00,370
about the rise of people living alone
in the world and also then about the

35
00:02:00,371 --> 00:02:02,200
research that went into modern romance.

36
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:04,960
And you'll see a common
thread emerge through them.

37
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:07,950
And the way I want to get into this is,
um,

38
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:12,970
by telling you about a magazine story
that came out a few years ago from the

39
00:02:12,971 --> 00:02:15,820
Atlantic, which is a really
serious and wonderful publication,

40
00:02:15,821 --> 00:02:20,140
always very provocative. Um,
definitely not a fake news publication,

41
00:02:20,141 --> 00:02:25,000
a real news publication. Um, the
tends to go very deep and, um,

42
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:25,660
they,
they,

43
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:29,590
they put this story on the cover a few
years ago and I don't know if you can

44
00:02:29,591 --> 00:02:30,311
read it clearly,

45
00:02:30,311 --> 00:02:34,840
but the covers stories is
Facebook making us lonely.

46
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:39,100
And that's a question,
but as you probably can tell already,

47
00:02:39,101 --> 00:02:41,770
it's also an accusation, right? Um,

48
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:45,700
of course the answer to the cover
story is not know otherwise.

49
00:02:45,701 --> 00:02:49,600
It wouldn't be on the cover.
Right. And even if it was no,

50
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:54,340
the deed is already done because you've
associated Facebook with loneliness in

51
00:02:54,341 --> 00:02:56,500
your mind.
And if I say don't think of an elephant,

52
00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:00,480
I've undermined myself
in that very way. So, um,

53
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:05,380
you here at Google need to know that the
story about whether Facebook is making

54
00:03:05,381 --> 00:03:08,200
us lonely is not just
a story about Facebook.

55
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:12,580
Google is also part of the story because
the broader question that this article

56
00:03:12,581 --> 00:03:16,390
is taking up and it's a question that
many people in the world these days are

57
00:03:16,391 --> 00:03:17,470
raising is,

58
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:23,520
is this new culture that we are creating
and that you are creating as much if

59
00:03:24,191 --> 00:03:25,900
not more than anyone.
Uh,

60
00:03:25,901 --> 00:03:30,901
where we spend all this time with our
screens on a amazing apps and programs and

61
00:03:31,871 --> 00:03:34,920
other, um, you know, features that, uh,

62
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:39,580
entertain us and help us be productive
and connect us and all kinds of

63
00:03:39,581 --> 00:03:43,060
interesting ways to people we'd
never otherwise be connected to our,

64
00:03:43,061 --> 00:03:45,040
all those things at the end of the day,

65
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:50,280
making us more lonely and more
isolated than ever before.

66
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:55,300
I'm sure all of you in this room have
heard a version of this question, right?

67
00:03:55,301 --> 00:03:55,421
I mean,

68
00:03:55,421 --> 00:04:00,220
it's a big problem that we're trying to
solve and the author of this piece in

69
00:04:00,221 --> 00:04:00,761
the Atlantic,

70
00:04:00,761 --> 00:04:05,320
which is a place that everybody who's got
ideas and rights wants to be says yes.

71
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:10,150
Uh, the claim in this article is that
we have never been lonelier. Okay.

72
00:04:10,151 --> 00:04:13,930
We are now, ironically, we were living
through the loneliest age and history and,

73
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:14,771
okay,

74
00:04:14,771 --> 00:04:19,771
so that's a deep and serious
journalistic publication.

75
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:24,910
In my own field we've had
similar kinds of debates and um,

76
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,120
I'm going to,
this is,

77
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,840
I'm going to talk to you about the study
that was in the American sociological

78
00:04:28,841 --> 00:04:31,450
review, uh, on social
isolation in American life.

79
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:35,980
Now I know that you're all regular readers
of the American sociological review,

80
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,450
but occasionally,
you know,

81
00:04:37,451 --> 00:04:41,440
you forget to put it that like little
card in the mail and your subscription

82
00:04:41,441 --> 00:04:42,700
lapses.
Um,

83
00:04:42,701 --> 00:04:45,970
so I'm just going to review for you the
findings of that study if you don't mind.

84
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:50,170
Um, and the, and the study on social
isolation made this incredible claim.

85
00:04:50,171 --> 00:04:51,130
The article came out in,

86
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:55,600
in 2006 and it was by a team
of sociologists based to Duke.

87
00:04:56,020 --> 00:05:00,490
Um, and the, the, the blockbuster finding
is the one that's on the screen there.

88
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:01,870
It said that, um, they,

89
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:06,850
they did a survey is based on a big
social survey and they looked at the

90
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:11,080
proportion of American adults
who said they have no confidence,

91
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:12,130
no close friends.

92
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:17,460
And it went from about one in 10 in 1985
which was fairly consistent with the

93
00:05:17,591 --> 00:05:19,700
long literature of studies on,

94
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:23,740
on social connections
to one in four in 2004.

95
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:25,570
Now,

96
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:29,560
obviously Facebook wasn't really a thing
much of a thing in 2004 I don't think

97
00:05:29,561 --> 00:05:31,990
it was a thing at all. Um, but,

98
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:34,420
so it's not Facebook that's
driving the story there, but the,

99
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:37,930
but the idea is that the big thing that
changed in our social world in that time

100
00:05:37,931 --> 00:05:41,650
period is the internet. And
so the claim was, you know,

101
00:05:41,651 --> 00:05:44,050
we're now more isolated than
we've ever been in there.

102
00:05:44,051 --> 00:05:48,370
All these people who are disappearing and
the Internet must be the cause of that.

103
00:05:48,371 --> 00:05:51,070
And, and when this article
came out, it was, you know,

104
00:05:51,071 --> 00:05:52,810
this is a image from USA Today.

105
00:05:52,811 --> 00:05:57,500
The authors were on the today show and
CNN and every publication in world did a

106
00:05:57,501 --> 00:05:59,990
feature on them because that's
an incredible finding, right?

107
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,450
One in four Americans have no confidence.

108
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:06,320
And even that claim doesn't
come out of nowhere.

109
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:11,000
There's a long history in the social
sciences of looking at the fraying social

110
00:06:11,001 --> 00:06:13,370
ties, uh, of modern life, right?

111
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:18,200
A longstanding claim that we have built
these big cities we built to kind of all

112
00:06:18,201 --> 00:06:20,780
kinds of modern conveniences
and a mass society.

113
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:25,580
And out of that has come
a level of isolation and
disconnection that we've never

114
00:06:25,581 --> 00:06:26,420
before established.

115
00:06:26,421 --> 00:06:30,590
So these are among the best selling
books in the history of sociology and the

116
00:06:30,591 --> 00:06:35,340
social sciences. Um, here on the other
side of the political spectrum, uh,

117
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,740
the American spectator,

118
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:40,500
a right wing publication on the
loneliness of American society.

119
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:43,640
Think very similar ideas.
More recently,

120
00:06:43,641 --> 00:06:47,800
probably some of you have seen books like
bowling alone from Robert Putnam. Um,

121
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:48,621
Sherry Turkle,

122
00:06:48,621 --> 00:06:52,100
I presume has been here to Google or to
the New York Google to talk about her

123
00:06:52,101 --> 00:06:56,000
research on people being alone together.
More recently,

124
00:06:56,001 --> 00:07:00,080
she's got a book about the
end of conversation. So this
is a very big idea, right?

125
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:04,700
And a couple of years ago when
I set out to write a book,

126
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:07,700
uh,
about the social trend,

127
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:10,010
I thought I would be contributing
to that conversation.

128
00:07:10,011 --> 00:07:13,610
So when I sold the book for the book,

129
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:18,530
for this research project,
the working title was alone in America.

130
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:21,860
Okay. Which fits really nicely
into this tradition, right?

131
00:07:21,861 --> 00:07:25,070
And so clearly it was about
to become a bestseller. Um,

132
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:29,930
all you need is the right title.
And as I started to do research,

133
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:34,960
I learned a bunch of amazing things that
really changed the way I think about

134
00:07:35,331 --> 00:07:38,870
this issue.
And give me these things,

135
00:07:38,871 --> 00:07:42,560
continue to give me pause when I
think about these issues today.

136
00:07:42,561 --> 00:07:44,330
And I want to walk you
through some of them, right?

137
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:48,710
So imagine if you were going to write
a book called the loan in America,

138
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:53,510
it would have a really different mood.
I really different cover image.

139
00:07:53,511 --> 00:07:55,330
Then they're going solo book,
right? It's going slowly.

140
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:58,190
You can see is a really different
idea. So how did I get there? Well,

141
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:01,100
this was the thing that made me want
to write this book in the first place.

142
00:08:01,101 --> 00:08:05,480
I noticed what for social scientists
is a staggering social change, right?

143
00:08:05,481 --> 00:08:10,010
So if any of you have ever been to a
meeting of sociologists are demographers,

144
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:14,330
when we discover something
like a percentage point
or two that's changed in a

145
00:08:14,331 --> 00:08:17,480
population trends, we're high
fiving in the hallways, you know,

146
00:08:17,481 --> 00:08:20,450
or like spiking the clicker at
the end of our talk. You know,

147
00:08:20,451 --> 00:08:22,550
that's a huge accomplishment to make.

148
00:08:22,551 --> 00:08:26,960
And the social sciences and you know,
strangely there's not,

149
00:08:26,961 --> 00:08:30,490
had not been a lot of
discussion about this, this,

150
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:35,520
this staggering change that from from
1950 to 2014 the proportion of American

151
00:08:36,921 --> 00:08:41,921
adults who are single or unmarried
goes from 22 to now about 50% right?

152
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,810
Half a slight.

153
00:08:44,811 --> 00:08:48,020
A slight majority of American adults
are single today for the first time in

154
00:08:48,021 --> 00:08:48,860
recorded history.

155
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:53,960
And the proportion of households that
have just one person has gone from 9% in

156
00:08:53,961 --> 00:08:58,020
1952 a little under 30% today.

157
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:02,310
And these are major,
major demographic changes in how we live.

158
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:06,210
And I thought this should be exhibit
a and the story of how Americans have

159
00:09:06,211 --> 00:09:09,270
become disconnected and lonely
and isolated. And in fact,

160
00:09:09,271 --> 00:09:13,230
if you read a lot of research papers
from other social scientists and surely

161
00:09:13,231 --> 00:09:17,700
lots of journalism, it is trotted out
as exhibit a for why we're so lonely.

162
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:20,790
Um, there are other ways to
represent this trend here.

163
00:09:20,791 --> 00:09:25,791
You can just see the kind of steady rise
of Americans who are living alone over

164
00:09:25,831 --> 00:09:27,960
time. Um, you know,

165
00:09:27,961 --> 00:09:32,280
this is a kind of demographic cut of
who's living alone. It's interesting when,

166
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:33,840
when I started this project,

167
00:09:33,841 --> 00:09:36,870
I had just written a book about a big
heat wave disaster in Chicago were

168
00:09:36,871 --> 00:09:41,520
hundreds of people died and died alone.
And I thought the story of,

169
00:09:41,521 --> 00:09:44,850
of living alone in the U s was really
primarily story of aging alone.

170
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:50,030
But it turns out that the largest group
of Americans who live alone are adults

171
00:09:50,401 --> 00:09:54,480
between the ages of 35 and
64 and in recent decades,

172
00:09:54,481 --> 00:09:59,040
the biggest spike in living alone has
come from this younger generation under

173
00:09:59,041 --> 00:10:03,350
the age of 35. Right? Like
you get married later, um,

174
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:05,190
and you start a family much later.

175
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:08,490
So the way that you become an adult
for a rising generation there was to,

176
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:11,340
is to get a place of your own right
to get the hell out of your parents'

177
00:10:11,341 --> 00:10:14,190
basement and get a place of your own.
So,

178
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:16,590
so even this chart was
really interesting to me.

179
00:10:16,591 --> 00:10:19,890
It seemed like a more interesting story.
And I also learned what I was doing,

180
00:10:19,891 --> 00:10:23,970
the research that whereas
up until about 1950, uh,

181
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:28,890
living alone was something that was most
common in big, sprawling western states.

182
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:33,880
Um, you know, in Nevada and
Wyoming and Montana by, uh,

183
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:37,800
2000 living alone had become
a very urban phenomenon.

184
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:42,930
I was most common in, in major
metropolitan areas. And you know,

185
00:10:42,931 --> 00:10:43,950
in Manhattan where I live,

186
00:10:43,951 --> 00:10:48,420
it's almost one and two households is a
one person household and San Francisco

187
00:10:48,421 --> 00:10:51,690
is like 40%, you think,
okay, San Francisco, New
York, those are weird places.

188
00:10:51,691 --> 00:10:56,520
They're not quite like America,
but look at this, you know,
Minneapolis, 43%, Denver,

189
00:10:56,521 --> 00:11:01,350
40%, Seattle, 42%, Atlanta, 45%. I mean,

190
00:11:01,351 --> 00:11:04,170
it really is far more pervasive.

191
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:09,480
The one person household than I had
understood and was actually far more

192
00:11:09,481 --> 00:11:12,910
pervasive than most social scientists
had really understood before I did it.

193
00:11:12,911 --> 00:11:16,740
So this rise of a single society
is a major force in the world.

194
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:21,690
So remember I talked about this in
terms of being alone in America at first

195
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:24,510
because my premise was that these were
people who are not just living alone,

196
00:11:24,511 --> 00:11:29,460
but also alone much of the time
and more isolated, more lonely.

197
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:32,340
Um, I'm going to tell you about
the alone part in a second,

198
00:11:32,341 --> 00:11:35,880
but I want to start by telling you like
when you're a social scientist and not a

199
00:11:35,881 --> 00:11:40,680
politician, a or an eye, or look in
an ideological, um, column writer,

200
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:45,000
one of the great things is you get
to be wrong and you get to be wrong.

201
00:11:45,001 --> 00:11:48,180
And then say, oh, I totally screwed
that up and I learned something.

202
00:11:48,570 --> 00:11:49,800
And here at the end of the day,

203
00:11:49,801 --> 00:11:52,560
I have a different idea about how
the world works. Then when I started,

204
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:57,060
that's what's about social research.
So let's start by how, how,

205
00:11:57,190 --> 00:12:00,790
what a bad idea it was for me to
talk about this as alone in America.

206
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:04,720
Living alone is not at all
an American trend. In fact,

207
00:12:04,721 --> 00:12:09,310
the United States is a laggard and not
a leader when it comes to being single.

208
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:13,750
Uh, we are way down on this list of
places that have a lot of living alone.

209
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:16,090
I don't know if you can read it.
It looks very, very small to me,

210
00:12:16,091 --> 00:12:19,120
but the Scandinavian countries
are at the very top of the list.

211
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:21,400
A bunch of European
countries are above us.

212
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:25,690
Living alone is more common in Japan
than it is in the United States,

213
00:12:25,691 --> 00:12:29,560
which is interesting given the kind of
family centric nature of that culture.

214
00:12:30,070 --> 00:12:34,210
Living alone is more prominent
in Canada and I don't know why,

215
00:12:34,211 --> 00:12:37,120
but just kind of irks me in general or
Canada ranks ahead of the United States

216
00:12:37,121 --> 00:12:40,240
in anything. So that's always been
an annoying, uh, finding for me.

217
00:12:40,241 --> 00:12:44,860
But say it again. There you go.
There you go. Flip it around.

218
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:48,160
Genius. We, when you kind
of need more thinking like
that and the next four years,

219
00:12:48,161 --> 00:12:52,900
I think. Um, so, um, okay. So what
about this alone business? You know,

220
00:12:52,901 --> 00:12:56,080
are we really alone? Okay. Yes, more
people are likely to live alone,

221
00:12:56,290 --> 00:12:58,530
but I started doing
some research on my own.

222
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:01,150
I discovered some extraordinary
thing. So for instance, um,

223
00:13:01,151 --> 00:13:06,151
it turns out that people who live alone
are actually more likely to spend time

224
00:13:06,551 --> 00:13:08,530
with friends and neighbors
and people who are married.

225
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:14,230
They're more likely to go out at night
and spend time in bars or in restaurants

226
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:18,730
and cafes, uh, book talks and
we're likely to book talks. Um,

227
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:20,500
they are also more likely,

228
00:13:20,501 --> 00:13:24,430
and this was a real surprise to me
to volunteer and civic organizations.

229
00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:29,090
So that idea of like the selfish
single, the narcissist is not right. Um,

230
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:33,590
here's a shocker for you.
Um, uh, it turns out that um,

231
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:38,410
women who are single and live alone
are far more likely to participate,

232
00:13:38,411 --> 00:13:41,860
significantly more likely to participate
in civic organizations than women who

233
00:13:41,861 --> 00:13:45,600
are married with children.
Um, Tufts sociology, like I,

234
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:50,170
someone told me that there's research
showing that women who are married tend to

235
00:13:50,171 --> 00:13:54,280
do more of the housework than their,
their spouses. Like more, you know,

236
00:13:54,281 --> 00:13:57,790
they do more cleaning and more kink taking
care of the children and things like

237
00:13:57,791 --> 00:14:02,650
that. I had exactly the same reaction.
You did like a can't be true.

238
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:07,210
There's no way that's right. But
apparently, apparently it is. Um,

239
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:11,500
and so women who are single actually I
have more time to engage in the world.

240
00:14:11,501 --> 00:14:15,280
And you know, it's not to say that
raising children is not a civic duty.

241
00:14:15,281 --> 00:14:16,180
It is of course,

242
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:19,780
but it's an interesting and surprising
finding this level of civic participation.

243
00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:25,120
But also if you look historically at
patterns of informal social participation,

244
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:29,890
you find a story that's very different
than the, is Facebook making us lonely?

245
00:14:30,090 --> 00:14:33,400
Uh, we've never been so lonely.
We've never been so isolated.

246
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:38,700
These patterns which show kind of overall
trends in spending time with relatives

247
00:14:39,851 --> 00:14:44,851
or with friends or with neighbors or in
bars show that basically things haven't

248
00:14:45,191 --> 00:14:47,120
changed all that much.
Uh,

249
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:51,740
over time we've had a modest decrease
in the amount of time that we with

250
00:14:51,741 --> 00:14:52,574
neighbors,

251
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:56,570
but we've also had an uptick in the
amount of time that we spend with friends

252
00:14:56,571 --> 00:14:57,740
who aren't from our neighborhood,

253
00:14:57,741 --> 00:15:01,400
which is consistent with our understanding
of the way we form social ties right

254
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:05,870
now. Overall patterns of
social participation or just
about the same as they were

255
00:15:05,871 --> 00:15:09,590
before for informal socializing.
Uh,

256
00:15:09,591 --> 00:15:13,430
and the percentage of people who are,
who are really never social,

257
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:17,630
who never socializing a is
also a pretty stable. Um,

258
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:21,860
so remember that research study I told
you about the isolation in America? Well,

259
00:15:21,861 --> 00:15:25,670
it turns out that the data
that that study drug drew upon,

260
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:30,170
we're flawed and inaccurate.
And now the, you know,

261
00:15:30,171 --> 00:15:32,110
one of the authors of this paper,

262
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:36,560
the graduate student who did the real
data crunching on this has backed off from

263
00:15:36,561 --> 00:15:40,160
the claim and says it's
not reliable. Um, uh,

264
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:44,240
it turns out though that this is what
my friends and I called the Great Zombie

265
00:15:44,241 --> 00:15:46,160
finding of the social sciences.
Like,

266
00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:50,030
no matter how often we all
kill the thing and say,

267
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:55,540
oh, no matter how often we say that,
it's, it's, it's not right. Uh, the, the,

268
00:15:55,610 --> 00:15:57,770
you can't kill this study. You, you see,

269
00:15:57,820 --> 00:16:01,190
like every time there's an article
about loneliness or social isolation,

270
00:16:01,191 --> 00:16:02,480
a trend in American life,

271
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:06,740
you will get in the first few paragraphs
a citation to this study and serious

272
00:16:06,741 --> 00:16:11,600
scholars do it all the time.
Journalists do it. It's a huge problem.

273
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:16,640
Um, but you can understand like why
that headline is so memorable. Um,

274
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:19,220
imagine if, um, you know,

275
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:22,370
when we put up findings
like the one you just saw,

276
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:26,510
the USA Today had a headline that said
Americans just about as lonely and

277
00:16:26,511 --> 00:16:28,070
isolated is,
we've always been,

278
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,810
that would be a completely boring headline
that no one would ever read or pay

279
00:16:32,811 --> 00:16:37,740
attention to. Um, it turns out that our
social life is much more interesting, um,

280
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:41,360
but also more stable than,
than people generally acknowledged.

281
00:16:41,361 --> 00:16:45,390
So I don't think that that we can
events this claim right now. Um,

282
00:16:45,410 --> 00:16:48,980
we can't show that there's been a real
spike in loneliness. In fact, the, the,

283
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,330
the main claim even empirically in the
Atlantic story about loneliness comes

284
00:16:53,331 --> 00:16:57,740
from a study that the arp did have older
people who were in fact not even using

285
00:16:57,741 --> 00:17:01,130
Facebook at the time. So the data
are really poor for this claim.

286
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:03,170
And that's not to say that,
that it's,

287
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:06,410
there's not potential for us to become
more lonely and more isolated given the

288
00:17:06,411 --> 00:17:10,020
way that we use technologies.
But it hasn't happened yet. Um,

289
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:11,930
who we should need to be a
lot more somber about this.

290
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:15,680
So I had written this book about the
rise of single people in the world and I

291
00:17:15,681 --> 00:17:18,640
did it with the penguin press
and a few weeks late, you know,

292
00:17:18,950 --> 00:17:21,980
I guess months after the thing came out,
I got this call out of nowhere saying,

293
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:25,490
uh, you know, Eric, it's your editor.

294
00:17:25,490 --> 00:17:28,880
I'm sorry to bother you.
I've got this kind of funny question.

295
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:33,170
Have you ever heard of this? A guy named
Aziz Ansari, and this is, you know,

296
00:17:33,171 --> 00:17:36,680
2013 so he wasn't quite
the household name. Um,

297
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:41,720
but he wasn't expecting my response,
which was Aziz Ansari. He's my hero.

298
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:45,700
Um, cause it turns out, you know, I
had become a big as Ansari sorry fan.

299
00:17:45,701 --> 00:17:49,460
And he said, oh, that's great
news because um, we really, uh,

300
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:53,850
we'd love to have you guys worked
together on a project. And I said, well,

301
00:17:53,851 --> 00:17:55,260
what's the project
about? And he said, well,

302
00:17:55,261 --> 00:17:58,080
let me explain and
actually why even better,

303
00:17:58,081 --> 00:18:00,780
why you just come down here as
these are sitting in my office, uh,

304
00:18:00,781 --> 00:18:03,740
and he wants to talk to you about it.
So I dropped my,

305
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:07,080
my things and raced over
there, uh, to go talk.

306
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:10,740
And here's Aziz his
account of the thing that,

307
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:13,980
that the problem that he was
trying to work through at the time.

308
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:18,580
You have a special out now that
everyone's talking about and a Aziz Ansari

309
00:18:18,581 --> 00:18:21,820
buried alive. I understand you're
already working on your next special,

310
00:18:21,821 --> 00:18:22,460
is that true?

311
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:25,400
Yeah. I voted you written the next hour
we're going to start touring it, uh,

312
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:28,220
next year. And um, yeah,
this one's about kind of a,

313
00:18:28,221 --> 00:18:31,340
this new one that I'm working on is about
kind of what it means to be single and

314
00:18:31,341 --> 00:18:35,120
this era. I think it's really
a frustrating time to be
a single person right now.

315
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:38,690
You know, I like the idea of being single
in theory, you know that's like, oh,

316
00:18:38,691 --> 00:18:39,950
you meet a bunch of different people.

317
00:18:39,951 --> 00:18:42,620
You get to know them when you
meet someone you really like.

318
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:44,990
You kind of pursue a deeper
thing that that sounds cool.

319
00:18:44,991 --> 00:18:46,820
I would sign up for that,
but that's not,

320
00:18:46,821 --> 00:18:50,240
we'll be in single is anymore now like
this is, this will be in single is now.

321
00:18:50,570 --> 00:18:52,670
Hey, it was great meeting you. We
should get together sometime. Yeah,

322
00:18:52,671 --> 00:18:56,390
they'd be great. Be in touch. All
right, cool. Bye. Hey, what's up?

323
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:57,810
She would grab a drink
tonight. Yeah. Yeah.

324
00:18:57,811 --> 00:19:00,230
I'm with some friends in this
neighborhood. Oh cool. Be Down there soon.

325
00:19:00,231 --> 00:19:04,940
Can't wait to see you. All right, cool.
Hey, what's up? We're almost there.

326
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,320
Shit, we just lab. Why? Why did you just,

327
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:13,950
why was on the way? Maybe get a
drink tomorrow. Tomorrow's perfect.

328
00:19:13,951 --> 00:19:17,310
Texted him and make a plan. All
right, cool. Bye. Hey, what's up?

329
00:19:17,311 --> 00:19:19,770
She grabbed those drinks tonight.
All drank way too much last night.

330
00:19:19,771 --> 00:19:22,410
Going to stay in today.
That's not what was discussed yesterday.

331
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:26,880
You need a transcript of our conversation.
Scroll up on your phone.

332
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:31,200
Maybe we can meet up on Tuesday. Tuesday's
perfect. Texted him and make a plan.

333
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:35,040
All right, cool. Bye. Hey, what's up?
As Tuesdays we get together today,

334
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:39,410
Liz,
now all that garbage.

335
00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:42,910
It's pretty much now,

336
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:47,940
a lot of times like you're a secretary
for this really shotty organization.

337
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:49,860
Scheduling the dumbest shit with the

338
00:19:50,050 --> 00:19:50,883
flaky as people.

339
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:59,810
All right. So, so that was the, um, the,

340
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:04,610
the problem that is ease with struggling
with when I first met him, you know,

341
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:09,350
um, okay. So there are all these people
who were single today and diseases,

342
00:20:09,351 --> 00:20:13,730
one of them and the culture has
really become confusing. Um,

343
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:17,240
it like once upon a time,
maybe it was easier to find romance.

344
00:20:17,241 --> 00:20:18,620
Maybe it was a simpler process.

345
00:20:18,621 --> 00:20:22,350
Now it seems really convoluted and as he's
wanting to know, you know, we'll, we'll,

346
00:20:22,351 --> 00:20:27,351
what do we actually know about how the
search for romance has changed over time?

347
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:31,850
Um, what are some of the dilemmas
that people face today? And he said,

348
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,120
I've been looking for, um,
for research or to try,

349
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:38,180
he didn't actually read a lot of
social science and I just couldn't find

350
00:20:38,181 --> 00:20:41,930
anything. So I just said, you know,
screw it. I'm going to do it myself. Um,

351
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:44,960
well maybe I'll do it myself. Maybe I'll
find a social scientist to do with me.

352
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:47,800
Um, and so we decided
to do it. And, you know,

353
00:20:47,801 --> 00:20:49,750
it was a very interesting collaboration.

354
00:20:49,751 --> 00:20:52,300
We had no idea what it
was going to be like.

355
00:20:52,301 --> 00:20:55,840
It was a terrifying thing
for me because, um, you know,

356
00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:59,660
I take my time pretty seriously,
my, like most scholars and, uh,

357
00:20:59,710 --> 00:21:04,600
kind of cherish the ability I have to do
research and, and uh, on the one hand,

358
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:08,380
this is a tremendously
exciting opportunity to work
with someone who I think is

359
00:21:08,381 --> 00:21:12,130
really a genius and entertaining and
insightful in ways that, you know,

360
00:21:12,131 --> 00:21:15,130
the great comedians are. But then the
other time it was, on the other hand,

361
00:21:15,131 --> 00:21:18,040
it was a little bit of a wild
ride to take. Um, but you know,

362
00:21:18,041 --> 00:21:21,700
you only live once and how could I
say no? Um, and that was the question,

363
00:21:21,701 --> 00:21:24,730
like which one of these
combinations was it going to be? Um,

364
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:27,610
so there's a bunch of things that,
that,

365
00:21:27,650 --> 00:21:32,320
that we tried to do to get ourselves
oriented to the questions for the book.

366
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:32,960
I'm,

367
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:37,960
one of them was just trying to figure
out what the search for romance is aiming

368
00:21:38,081 --> 00:21:39,490
towards these days.

369
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:42,640
And it's pretty clear that if you
look at our search for romance,

370
00:21:42,641 --> 00:21:47,641
historically our expectations of what
we want have changed quite a bit,

371
00:21:48,191 --> 00:21:50,440
even over the last several decades.
Um,

372
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:54,210
the way that we really establish this
or that I was able to establish this for

373
00:21:54,211 --> 00:21:56,080
is ease. As I said, look, you know,

374
00:21:56,081 --> 00:22:00,310
most of the people you hang out with are
in their twenties or early thirties, um,

375
00:22:00,730 --> 00:22:03,250
and you have this particular
kind of world that you inhabit.

376
00:22:03,910 --> 00:22:05,590
We're here in Manhattan right now.

377
00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:09,730
Let's walk down a few blocks from
the village to the lower east side.

378
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:12,250
And let's go to an old folks home.

379
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:15,610
Let's go to a senior center and
gather a bunch of people together for

380
00:22:15,611 --> 00:22:19,780
conversation, uh, and, and have them
tell us about how they met their spouse.

381
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,910
And he's, he's just like, oh, that
sounds like a really good idea,

382
00:22:21,911 --> 00:22:24,850
but why on earth would a,
anyone ever come and talk to us?

383
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,940
They're not going to know who we are.
You know, they've got other stuff to do.

384
00:22:27,941 --> 00:22:31,360
And I was like, no problem.
We can solve this donuts.

385
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:35,590
So we went and got boxes of donuts and
we showed up at the senior center and

386
00:22:35,591 --> 00:22:38,710
everybody came for the conversation
and it was a great conversation,

387
00:22:38,711 --> 00:22:39,940
a great way to recruit a sample.

388
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:43,690
And we started asking people to tell
us the story about how they met their

389
00:22:43,691 --> 00:22:47,800
spouse. And one after the next
people would say, oh, well, you know,

390
00:22:47,801 --> 00:22:52,801
I was 23 years old and I was living
with my parents and my older brother had

391
00:22:54,131 --> 00:22:56,230
this friend and I knew that guy.

392
00:22:56,230 --> 00:23:00,040
Like he'd spend a lot of time around the
family when I was a kid and you know,

393
00:23:00,041 --> 00:23:01,600
we went out one day and he
seemed like a pretty good guy.

394
00:23:01,601 --> 00:23:05,530
So we got married and there was
like, Oh wow, that's a crazy story.

395
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:07,780
And then what next one?
Oh, you know, there was a,

396
00:23:07,781 --> 00:23:11,350
someone who lives in my building and I
know their family forever and I was 19

397
00:23:11,351 --> 00:23:15,100
years old and I was living at home
and one for, uh, for a few times.

398
00:23:15,101 --> 00:23:17,890
And we got married and we were
like trying to figure out, well,

399
00:23:17,891 --> 00:23:21,240
this is an amazing thing. What's this
about? That seems really odd. And,

400
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:23,800
and people started explaining,
well, actually, you know,

401
00:23:23,801 --> 00:23:27,880
the thing was that back then it wasn't
really legitimate for you to move out of

402
00:23:27,881 --> 00:23:30,400
your parents' house,
especially if you were a woman.

403
00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:34,300
If you weren't married and you really
want it to escape your parental control,

404
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:37,310
parental control. And this
was a great way to do it. Um,

405
00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:40,930
like premarital sex is really frowned
upon. It's just no place to go.

406
00:23:41,050 --> 00:23:45,440
And so getting married, uh, was something
that you did very early, uh, in life.

407
00:23:45,441 --> 00:23:48,320
And it was also something
that you did very local.

408
00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:50,840
And so we heard these conversations.
I said, you know, that rings a bell.

409
00:23:50,841 --> 00:23:53,390
I remember these studies that I
had heard about in graduate school.

410
00:23:53,391 --> 00:23:57,110
Let me go back and see. And it turns
out that in the 1930s and forties,

411
00:23:57,380 --> 00:24:01,820
there was an industry in American
sociology of doing propinquity studies.

412
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,830
And sociologists would look at things
like the marriage records of 5,000

413
00:24:06,831 --> 00:24:11,330
consecutive marriages in the city
of Philadelphia and see, you know,

414
00:24:11,410 --> 00:24:12,590
who was marrying whom?

415
00:24:12,650 --> 00:24:15,890
Just cause you had to put your address
for both the husband and the wife and the,

416
00:24:15,891 --> 00:24:16,970
and the wedding certificate.

417
00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:19,720
So this is one classic study
from a guy named James Broussard.

418
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:23,840
It came out I think in 1933
and it's extraordinary.

419
00:24:23,841 --> 00:24:28,550
It shows that about, um, so this is,
this, this unfortunately you can't see,

420
00:24:28,551 --> 00:24:33,230
but it's like around 12, 12% of
marriages in the city of Philadelphia.

421
00:24:33,231 --> 00:24:36,920
This is just 5,000 straight marriage
records where people who lived in the same

422
00:24:36,921 --> 00:24:40,370
building, okay, not related. Um,

423
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:42,710
about four and a half percent,

424
00:24:42,711 --> 00:24:46,430
we're on the same block and
6% were within two blocks.

425
00:24:46,490 --> 00:24:49,040
So it's almost one in four marriages.

426
00:24:49,041 --> 00:24:54,041
And Philadelphia in 1932 were two between
two people who live within two blocks

427
00:24:55,821 --> 00:24:59,900
of one another. You know, and
as easy as like, I don't even,

428
00:24:59,930 --> 00:25:02,720
I wouldn't even want to go for coffee
with one of those Bozos who live within

429
00:25:02,721 --> 00:25:05,030
two blocks of me, like let
alone, let alone get married.

430
00:25:05,150 --> 00:25:10,150
And so something like 80% of all marriages
took place to people who lived within

431
00:25:11,991 --> 00:25:15,020
20 blocks of one another in Philadelphia.

432
00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:19,430
And the typical age of first marriage
around the time was something like 21 or

433
00:25:19,431 --> 00:25:23,300
22 for women and 23 for men.
Right?

434
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:27,020
And when people were looking for what
the sociologist Andrew Cherlynn calls the

435
00:25:27,021 --> 00:25:31,340
good enough spouse, they
wanted a good enough marriage,
like someone who was like,

436
00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:32,940
they're there. They,
we're not an ax murderer.

437
00:25:32,941 --> 00:25:35,840
It was basically their number one
characteristic and the number two,

438
00:25:35,841 --> 00:25:37,460
it was like they knew
somebody in the family.

439
00:25:37,461 --> 00:25:41,690
And you probably grew up around
that, right? So now, 2010,

440
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:44,020
um, yeah, you know,

441
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:47,960
5% of people in 2010 married
somebody who was a neighbor.

442
00:25:48,850 --> 00:25:52,910
Um,
22% met someone who they met online,

443
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:55,640
married someone they met
online to already today.

444
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:58,130
A meeting online is the,

445
00:25:58,131 --> 00:26:02,330
is the most common way that
Americans meet their spouses. Um,

446
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:05,730
people still met in, in bars and got
married. By the way, that's a tie.

447
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:08,570
If you're single, that's a terrible place
to meet someone to get married. Don't,

448
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:13,220
don't marry someone you met in a club,
please. So it's a really bad idea. Um,

449
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:15,200
uh, friends of friends, also very common,

450
00:26:15,201 --> 00:26:18,110
but you could see just how much
the world has changed from,

451
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:23,030
from 1930 to 2010 and it's extraordinary
what this transformation is.

452
00:26:23,150 --> 00:26:27,800
And, and, and, you know, and, and by the
way, that's, that's for straight couples.

453
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:31,480
For same sex couples, uh, the, the,

454
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:35,600
the use of the Internet is
off the charts, right? And,

455
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:39,080
and that was a kind of a wreck,
a very difficult situation.

456
00:26:39,081 --> 00:26:43,630
If you grew up in a community where
there weren't a lot of out, uh, uh,

457
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:47,240
people interested in same
sex relationships, it was
very hard to find someone.

458
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:51,480
The Internet has completely changed
the game there, right? Uh, and, and,

459
00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:53,490
and what's happening now is,
you know,

460
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:56,490
we're starting to see these trends
move into other areas and including,

461
00:26:56,491 --> 00:27:01,090
it's like second marriages, um,
older people who are, uh, you know,

462
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:05,920
looking for kind of a second marriage or
third marriage after a divorce or a, uh,

463
00:27:06,090 --> 00:27:09,690
they've become widows or widowers.
The Internet is really growing as a,

464
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:13,200
as a way to meet people.
But when people look to get married,

465
00:27:13,201 --> 00:27:15,390
they're not just looking for
good enough spouse anymore.

466
00:27:15,930 --> 00:27:19,260
Generally people in interviews will tell
you they're looking for a soul mate,

467
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:23,640
right? They're looking for someone
who's, who's like, they completes,

468
00:27:23,641 --> 00:27:28,440
who completes them, uh, who with whom
they feel like this kind of deep, deep,

469
00:27:28,441 --> 00:27:33,000
soulful connection that, that they
wouldn't otherwise have in life. Right?

470
00:27:33,001 --> 00:27:35,880
And so not only do we think it's
okay to look for a soul mate,

471
00:27:35,881 --> 00:27:40,110
that's what we should do. We're willing
to spend a very long time in that search,

472
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:45,090
right? So today we marry
later than ever. Historically,

473
00:27:45,091 --> 00:27:50,091
the average age of first marriage is 26
or 27 for women and 28 or 29 for men in

474
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:55,200
urban communities like this one, the
average age of first marriage is over 30.

475
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:56,191
Right?

476
00:27:56,191 --> 00:27:58,920
If you work at Google and you've got like
a 26 year old colleague who's getting

477
00:27:58,921 --> 00:28:02,580
married 50 years ago, it'd
be like, that's amazing.

478
00:28:02,581 --> 00:28:05,670
I can't believe it took you so long,
but congratulations. That's great news.

479
00:28:05,671 --> 00:28:08,150
I hope you can still
get pregnant. And, and,

480
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:12,210
and now if you have a 26 year olds
gay man, he's like, are you crazy?

481
00:28:13,050 --> 00:28:16,620
What are you doing? You know, you
have to live a little bit, you know,

482
00:28:16,621 --> 00:28:19,230
you don't even know who
you're going to be yet. Right.

483
00:28:19,290 --> 00:28:20,990
And actually it turns out that,
um,

484
00:28:21,370 --> 00:28:24,510
we know that if you get
married before the age of 25,

485
00:28:24,511 --> 00:28:28,200
you are far more likely to get divorced.
And if you get married after,

486
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:32,370
and we have the sense that by kind of
growing up as a, as a single person,

487
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:36,110
you're in a better position to have a
stable relationship over time and the date

488
00:28:36,111 --> 00:28:37,290
of bare that out a little bit.
So,

489
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:39,780
so one big change is we have a
different expectation, right?

490
00:28:39,781 --> 00:28:40,890
We're not looking for,

491
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:45,430
we're not looking for a good enough
marriages were looking for soul mates. Um,

492
00:28:45,431 --> 00:28:47,700
that's a very hard search.
It can take a very long time,

493
00:28:47,701 --> 00:28:49,530
but the potential payoff can be very high.

494
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:53,550
Another big change is obviously
about the way that we do that search.

495
00:28:53,551 --> 00:28:56,910
And when I showed you some slides that
suggested how much the Internet has

496
00:28:56,911 --> 00:29:00,290
become a part of this,
but one of the, the, um,

497
00:29:00,450 --> 00:29:03,780
things that disease was convinced of
and that was born out by the research we

498
00:29:03,781 --> 00:29:04,860
did over a couple of years,

499
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:10,100
is that being single is very different
in a world that where most of us live a

500
00:29:10,711 --> 00:29:13,440
lot of our lives in these machines,
right?

501
00:29:13,650 --> 00:29:15,900
Anyone here happen to be
carrying a phone with them today?

502
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:20,130
Anybody have a phone with them?
Um, w we do, of course you're,

503
00:29:20,150 --> 00:29:24,720
you're the only honest person in the room.
Um, we're all carrying phones with us.

504
00:29:24,721 --> 00:29:27,600
We all carry phones with us wherever we
go. If we don't have our phones with us,

505
00:29:27,601 --> 00:29:29,640
we feel really weird. Like
someone has, you know,

506
00:29:29,641 --> 00:29:34,350
like taking our oxygen away and um,
and that's changed the way that we,

507
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:35,610
that we live, right? We,

508
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:40,290
we participate in this face to face world
occasionally like speaking at Google

509
00:29:40,291 --> 00:29:42,070
and this series is amazing
cause they'd be like, okay,

510
00:29:42,071 --> 00:29:44,590
like there's gonna be like
30 or 40 people at your talk,

511
00:29:44,710 --> 00:29:48,820
but there'll be 3000 people watching
you from their desks. I'd be like, oh,

512
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:50,380
that's in New York.
That makes a lot of sense.

513
00:29:50,381 --> 00:29:51,790
Like it's too bad they
can't be there. Like, no,

514
00:29:51,791 --> 00:29:56,740
like in the next room since we've weird
does actually see you face to face.

515
00:29:56,741 --> 00:30:00,550
So Hi guys, watching on your screens
right now. There's plenty of seats.

516
00:30:00,551 --> 00:30:02,200
You guys are all welcome
to come and join us.

517
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:05,860
So we spend a lot of
our time on our phones.

518
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:11,140
And what that means is that
whereas, you know, not long ago,

519
00:30:11,141 --> 00:30:12,670
if you wanted to meet somebody,

520
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:18,340
you would go to like a bar or to a party,
like friends of friends,

521
00:30:18,341 --> 00:30:22,090
you'd be set up on a date.
And those things happen by the way.

522
00:30:22,091 --> 00:30:24,070
Like some people would do
that at nine in the morning,

523
00:30:24,071 --> 00:30:26,670
but most of us did that after
eight at night. You know,

524
00:30:26,690 --> 00:30:27,830
like you'd go out and those,

525
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:32,020
like I remember like when I was in
college Thursday or Friday night,

526
00:30:32,021 --> 00:30:35,020
you would walk out and you would all go
to like a physical party together and

527
00:30:35,021 --> 00:30:37,720
you'd hope that that person who was in
your history class, it was really cute,

528
00:30:37,721 --> 00:30:39,880
would show up and maybe even think like,

529
00:30:39,910 --> 00:30:42,790
oh maybe I know she's going to come
to that party and you didn't have cell

530
00:30:42,791 --> 00:30:45,490
phones. So you just hope that she was
there and like the same hour block.

531
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:46,361
And if not,

532
00:30:46,361 --> 00:30:49,180
you'd spend like the whole night walking
around campus hoping you'd bump into

533
00:30:49,181 --> 00:30:50,830
each other.
Right.

534
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:55,060
And now it's like you would never do that
because you would just text the person

535
00:30:55,210 --> 00:30:58,270
and find out if they were there.
But more importantly,

536
00:30:58,271 --> 00:31:00,430
for people who aren't on college campuses,

537
00:31:01,030 --> 00:31:04,750
you're basically carrying a single's
bar in your pocket all the time,

538
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:09,550
right? So if you're here and you
have a phone and you're single,

539
00:31:10,690 --> 00:31:14,500
and I'm sure there's at least one of you
like that here, chances are, you know,

540
00:31:14,501 --> 00:31:17,950
you've got Tinder on your phone,
right? You've got bumble in your phone,

541
00:31:18,130 --> 00:31:20,560
you've got Okcupid in your phone.
If you're really serious about this,

542
00:31:20,561 --> 00:31:23,620
you've got matching your
phone. You're like, I'm going
to do that this year. 2017.

543
00:31:23,950 --> 00:31:27,230
I'm going to go from match.com I'm
going to make a commitment. Um,

544
00:31:28,390 --> 00:31:31,390
and that really changes the dynamics.
It means that like at any given moment,

545
00:31:31,391 --> 00:31:35,320
you have access to thousands of potential
partners and you could be flirting

546
00:31:35,321 --> 00:31:35,801
with them.

547
00:31:35,801 --> 00:31:38,710
You can be just kind of playing around
like we were doing the research.

548
00:31:38,711 --> 00:31:42,400
Tinder had just come out and nobody wanted
to admit that they're actually trying

549
00:31:42,401 --> 00:31:44,170
to meet people on
Tinder. They're like, oh,

550
00:31:44,171 --> 00:31:47,210
I just did it as it was my friends
kind of for a laugh, which is really,

551
00:31:47,211 --> 00:31:48,890
if we all thought it was funny,
but you know,

552
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,420
everybody was starting to date on Tinder.
Um, and this is really challenging.

553
00:31:52,421 --> 00:31:55,480
Like it's hard to do the thing you're
supposed to be doing at any given time

554
00:31:55,481 --> 00:31:58,300
because you are living with a
single's bar in your pocket, right?

555
00:31:58,630 --> 00:32:00,520
That's a very tough situation.

556
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,550
What that also means is you're
looking for your soul mate.

557
00:32:03,730 --> 00:32:06,640
You've got thousands of options and uh,

558
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:09,250
people every day are presented
with what Barry Schwartz,

559
00:32:09,251 --> 00:32:13,020
the psychologist talks about is the
paradox of choice, right? Um, you know,

560
00:32:13,230 --> 00:32:16,540
you've got all these possibilities
and it turns out it's really,

561
00:32:16,541 --> 00:32:21,541
really difficult to live with
enormous numbers of options there.

562
00:32:21,731 --> 00:32:24,670
Maximizers in the world who are
always looking for the best thing.

563
00:32:24,671 --> 00:32:26,350
And if we're looking for love,
we're probably looking at,

564
00:32:26,351 --> 00:32:28,330
we're probably maximizers
most of the time.

565
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,730
And then they're satisfied writers who
were just like looking for the good

566
00:32:30,731 --> 00:32:33,100
enough marriage, but they're not,
a lot of those satisfies sirs.

567
00:32:33,310 --> 00:32:35,080
And the problem is now,

568
00:32:35,081 --> 00:32:38,440
if you are looking for the best
relationship and you have Tinder,

569
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:42,470
the the comparisons can never stop.
Right?

570
00:32:42,770 --> 00:32:46,540
And so what's so difficult about
choice Schwartz told us is, you know,

571
00:32:46,550 --> 00:32:49,350
first of all, when you
have a lot of options, um,

572
00:32:49,610 --> 00:32:53,270
it's difficult to know what it is that
you really care about. You know, what,

573
00:32:53,271 --> 00:32:55,160
what should really mattered
to you and how do you,

574
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:59,090
how do you make a selection for a
particular person? But then also,

575
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:03,710
let's say I've gone through like 150
people on Tinder and I've swiped right and

576
00:33:03,711 --> 00:33:04,610
she swiped right too.

577
00:33:04,611 --> 00:33:07,850
And we make the connection and then
we go and meet each other within five

578
00:33:07,851 --> 00:33:12,180
minutes. I'm like, oh, is that really
the right person? Because there are one,

579
00:33:12,210 --> 00:33:16,760
you know, 999 other people who
are there, you know, tonight.

580
00:33:16,761 --> 00:33:17,241
And if I,

581
00:33:17,241 --> 00:33:20,180
if like I managed to run to the bathroom
and like swipe right again and see.

582
00:33:20,181 --> 00:33:23,840
So there's problem with people not
feeling good about the choices they made

583
00:33:23,841 --> 00:33:26,570
because they have regret about
the people they've overlooked.

584
00:33:26,810 --> 00:33:31,340
And that's an enormous challenge
for people who are dating today. Um,

585
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:34,910
then there are all kinds of
interactional dilemmas, um,

586
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:39,710
that happened when people are trying
to find romance through machines. Um,

587
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:44,510
you know, the [inaudible], anybody here
ever had this conversation with a friend?

588
00:33:44,511 --> 00:33:48,410
Like
you meet somebody online and,

589
00:33:48,411 --> 00:33:49,580
or your friend meet someone online.

590
00:33:49,581 --> 00:33:52,590
Let's just talk about in terms of
friends and they're like, oh, uh,

591
00:33:52,970 --> 00:33:55,430
I liked them and ask them out,
but I don't know what the right messages.

592
00:33:55,431 --> 00:33:57,390
And the person's like, oh, it
doesn't matter what you write.

593
00:33:57,420 --> 00:33:58,970
Like if they like your picture,
they're going to like you.

594
00:33:58,971 --> 00:34:00,200
If they're like your picture,
they're going to like you.

595
00:34:00,201 --> 00:34:01,970
It doesn't matter what you,
what you texts, you know,

596
00:34:01,971 --> 00:34:04,550
don't even worry about the messaging.
And anyone heard a version of that story?

597
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:07,820
Yes, yes, yes. Okay. Thank you.

598
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:13,070
Google is still alive.
Um, okay. So as these,

599
00:34:13,090 --> 00:34:16,370
and I want it to get like the definitive
scientific answer to this question of

600
00:34:16,371 --> 00:34:19,700
does it actually matter what you text
someone or is it really just about the

601
00:34:19,701 --> 00:34:22,820
pictures? Like, we know the pictures
are really important. So, um,

602
00:34:23,090 --> 00:34:25,880
we realize that every night
when disease is doing standup,

603
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:29,480
he was talking to thousands of
people and it was a great way to have

604
00:34:29,481 --> 00:34:32,300
conversations about, you know,
people's experiences in the world.

605
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:36,230
We could kind of use them as like massive
social experiments and interviews and

606
00:34:36,231 --> 00:34:38,370
focus groups. So, um,

607
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:43,400
I want to read you a quick passage from
the book and if you can just like try to

608
00:34:43,401 --> 00:34:47,360
imagine me reading this in diseases,
voice will be a much funnier. Okay.

609
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:49,970
So he says at this particular show,

610
00:34:49,971 --> 00:34:54,350
I was speaking with Rachel who had met
a guy and a good friend's wedding as it

611
00:34:54,351 --> 00:34:56,310
happened.
The guy was also a friend of her sisters.

612
00:34:56,311 --> 00:34:59,690
So he had a pretty good shot at a
first date with her. She was single,

613
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:03,470
she was interested. All he had to
do was send her a simple message,

614
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:07,220
introducing himself and asking her to
do something. Here's what happened.

615
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:11,750
He sends his first message,
Hi Rachel. Exclamation point.

616
00:35:12,050 --> 00:35:15,170
Since I never got a chance to ask you
to dance at Marissa and Chris's wedding

617
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:19,730
parentheses, I'm Chris, his
old roommate from Purdue. Dot.
Dot. Dot. And parenthesis,

618
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:21,680
he and your sister gave me your number.

619
00:35:21,770 --> 00:35:26,450
I wanted to say hi and sort of
texty introduced myself. Haha.

620
00:35:26,451 --> 00:35:30,260
Smiley face. Hope you had a great
weekend. Hope to chat with you soon.

621
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:37,000
As soon as I said texty it was clear
that no one sitting in the 3,600 seats,

622
00:35:37,341 --> 00:35:40,710
Chicago theater, whatever. Fuck
this dude in a million years.

623
00:35:42,270 --> 00:35:46,200
Texty for whatever reason
seem to be unequivocally
disgusting to every one of us

624
00:35:46,201 --> 00:35:49,020
there. He might as well
have added, by the way,

625
00:35:49,021 --> 00:35:53,760
I have a really disgusting next level
STD. Haha Smiley face. But for real,

626
00:35:53,761 --> 00:35:57,210
I do.
Rachel wrote back 10 minutes later by the,

627
00:35:57,220 --> 00:36:00,880
I recognize this is probably the
end of the [inaudible] Google uh,

628
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:05,730
seminar series here. So, uh, it is what
it is. It was good while it lasted.

629
00:36:07,770 --> 00:36:09,900
Hey, exclamation point.
Great to meet you too.

630
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:12,660
Currently enjoying my birthday
weekend with lots of good Mexican food

631
00:36:12,690 --> 00:36:15,210
parentheses. It happens when
your birthday is Cinco de Mayo.

632
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:20,360
Hope you had a great weekend too.
He wrote back shortly. I totally,

633
00:36:20,370 --> 00:36:24,270
there's like eight owes here. I totally
realized upon reading my last message,

634
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:25,350
I didn't include my name.

635
00:36:25,870 --> 00:36:30,620
I will smiley face for company on
yellows as well and totally right.

636
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:32,310
Digging on that Cinco de Mayo theme,

637
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:39,330
Rachel never met will
after a few messages of this nature,

638
00:36:39,450 --> 00:36:43,140
Rachel stopped responding. None
of us know, well he may be a kind,

639
00:36:43,141 --> 00:36:44,550
handsome man with a heart of gold,

640
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:48,660
but all we have to go on and it's those
messages and those messages if shaped in

641
00:36:48,661 --> 00:36:52,530
our minds, a very dorky
terrifyingly Caucasian Weirdo.

642
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:03,150
Yes, it matters what you text
now. Um, it matters what you text,

643
00:37:03,151 --> 00:37:06,830
but it's hard still to know
what is appropriate to tax
and what isn't it because

644
00:37:07,130 --> 00:37:11,270
our norms about what you can communicate
via text message are changing very

645
00:37:11,271 --> 00:37:14,000
rapidly and things,

646
00:37:14,450 --> 00:37:19,370
things that seem really
strange to us today, you know,
might soon be very normal.

647
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:24,530
Um, and, and in fact, like even,

648
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:27,940
even as we did the interviews for the
book with people of different generations,

649
00:37:27,941 --> 00:37:31,370
we heard really funny things.
Like, you know, when we started,

650
00:37:31,371 --> 00:37:33,370
we ask these questions. Like
I said, I have this key,

651
00:37:33,371 --> 00:37:35,410
is it okay to break up with
somebody by texts, you know,

652
00:37:35,411 --> 00:37:36,670
can you break up his own by text?

653
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:40,510
And we talked to people who are in their
late twenties I'd be like, oh, no way.

654
00:37:40,690 --> 00:37:45,100
You know that, that that is, I'm not,
I know I'm not 30 yet, but still,

655
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,920
that is a horrible thing to
do to a person, you know,

656
00:37:47,921 --> 00:37:51,740
like breaking off is really
painful and you know,

657
00:37:51,741 --> 00:37:55,720
you owe it to that person to be there
face to face and just to say what you

658
00:37:55,810 --> 00:37:58,360
think and to have that physical
interaction with someone.

659
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:59,800
Like I would never do that.

660
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:03,100
And we talked to people who are like in
their late or early twenties and they'd

661
00:38:03,101 --> 00:38:07,340
say, you know, I know that you
shouldn't break up with somebody by tax.

662
00:38:07,341 --> 00:38:11,830
I mean it's a shitty thing to
do. But honestly, like yes,
yes I do. And we're like,

663
00:38:11,831 --> 00:38:15,880
we do everything by text.
So I figure we might as well,

664
00:38:15,881 --> 00:38:19,300
like I asked her out by text, the
first time's fine. So yes, I do it.

665
00:38:19,301 --> 00:38:21,450
I don't feel good about it.
I know it's not right. Um,

666
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:26,320
but I do it and we talked to like,
people in their late teens,

667
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:30,370
you know, like freshmen in college
and be like, Oh my God is he is Eric.

668
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:32,950
I wish someone would
break up with me by tax.

669
00:38:32,951 --> 00:38:35,170
Like all I want in life is somebody
to break up with him via tax.

670
00:38:35,171 --> 00:38:39,130
Like there's this guy I was seeing for
months and I haven't heard from him in

671
00:38:39,131 --> 00:38:41,950
forever and I think we're not
going out anymore, but I, you know,

672
00:38:41,951 --> 00:38:43,510
I don't really know
because he doesn't respond.

673
00:38:43,511 --> 00:38:46,840
So if you just write me a text message
and say it's over, it would be amazing.

674
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:52,980
So we're even seeing this like change
from these small kind of parts inside

675
00:38:53,441 --> 00:38:54,880
generations over time.

676
00:38:58,180 --> 00:39:02,140
Right. The overall kind of threading
through all of this is this question of,

677
00:39:02,690 --> 00:39:06,510
you know, returned back to this Facebook
issue of this Facebook make us lonely.

678
00:39:06,511 --> 00:39:08,440
It doesn't make us lonely. But, um,

679
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:13,860
now that we do spend so much of our time
interacting with people digitally and

680
00:39:13,931 --> 00:39:18,931
now that our social worlds of expanded
so that we interact with people who we

681
00:39:19,031 --> 00:39:23,050
don't know all that well
personally, maybe we have, um,

682
00:39:23,310 --> 00:39:26,650
text-based relationships or
they're part of a social circle,

683
00:39:26,651 --> 00:39:29,500
their friends or friends of friends,
but they're still there. Um,

684
00:39:30,190 --> 00:39:35,190
does it make it easier for us to
treat them as bubbles on a screen?

685
00:39:36,850 --> 00:39:40,930
Right. And not as people. And I don't
think we've settled the, this question,

686
00:39:40,931 --> 00:39:42,990
but I think it, it really is an
interesting question. You know, what,

687
00:39:42,991 --> 00:39:47,080
what is the evolving nature of social
norms in a world where we're communicating

688
00:39:47,081 --> 00:39:50,950
with different kinds of people who are,
you know, part of our network in some way.

689
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:55,420
Um, but not, you know, core
intimate partners. Okay.

690
00:39:56,590 --> 00:39:58,510
Let me wrap up.
Um,

691
00:39:58,930 --> 00:40:01,240
I always feel like I should provide
some public service at the end of these

692
00:40:01,241 --> 00:40:04,990
talks. Um, so you know, people
often want to know like, okay,

693
00:40:04,991 --> 00:40:07,630
you did all that research
is very interesting. Uh,

694
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:12,010
appreciate that a ton of time when you
read from the Book and God is he his

695
00:40:12,011 --> 00:40:15,520
voice in there? Cause I actually got
a genuine laugh in that moment. Um,

696
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:18,610
but is there anything that you learned
in the course of this project that can

697
00:40:18,611 --> 00:40:22,540
actually help me as a single
person or my cousin? Um,

698
00:40:22,810 --> 00:40:24,880
and so I've got three things
I'd like to close with today.

699
00:40:24,881 --> 00:40:29,290
Three short pieces of advice if you're
interested anyone that'd be helpful just

700
00:40:29,291 --> 00:40:34,000
to get to the three. Kind of like dating
tips from all this occasionally. Okay.

701
00:40:34,090 --> 00:40:37,720
We've got three, three, three dating
tips that happy to come back on, uh,

702
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:41,650
on Valentine's Day in a few
weeks. Um, okay. Number one.

703
00:40:41,651 --> 00:40:44,920
First a dating tip comes from, um, uh,

704
00:40:44,921 --> 00:40:48,820
actually comes from Robb Willer who's a
sociologist and social psychologist at

705
00:40:48,821 --> 00:40:51,190
Stanford. If he hasn't come
here, cliff, to give a talk,

706
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:55,070
you should get him over here. He's a
great, great guy, amazing speaker. Um,

707
00:40:55,390 --> 00:40:59,700
and rob was helping us with some
of the, um, uh, analysis he's,

708
00:40:59,770 --> 00:41:03,220
he does to these terrific social
experiments. But then actually what,

709
00:41:03,221 --> 00:41:06,820
what rob wound up helping us with the
most came from his own life and he was

710
00:41:06,821 --> 00:41:11,230
like, oh well one of the problems with,
with dating these days is like, you,

711
00:41:11,231 --> 00:41:14,920
you don't want to go on these
really boring ass first dates.

712
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,210
Everybody online does like the,
they do this boring ass first dates.

713
00:41:19,540 --> 00:41:21,060
And the reason is that,
um,

714
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:23,860
can you raise your hand if you've ever
gone on an online date in this room?

715
00:41:23,861 --> 00:41:27,340
Could you mind, I know where to workplace.
That's a little bit awkward. Okay. So, so,

716
00:41:27,341 --> 00:41:30,700
um, okay. So if you ever go
on a first date with someone
you met online, you know,

717
00:41:30,701 --> 00:41:33,530
the problem is you don't want to
overinvest in the first, right.

718
00:41:33,531 --> 00:41:37,940
Cause this stranger and we
know that they're like five
years older and 25 pounds

719
00:41:37,941 --> 00:41:41,180
heavier than they look in their
photograph. Right? And so,

720
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:44,390
so nobody really wants to overinvest
it's not like you have a first date,

721
00:41:44,391 --> 00:41:44,601
you know,

722
00:41:44,601 --> 00:41:47,840
we're going to men Raisa and then I
rented a sailboat and we're going to do a

723
00:41:47,841 --> 00:41:49,640
cruise.
But you never do that.

724
00:41:49,641 --> 00:41:54,350
But you also don't want to like go
to Starbucks and have a latte because

725
00:41:54,650 --> 00:41:59,150
everything we know about research on
dating says like our experiences and other

726
00:41:59,151 --> 00:42:03,260
person is contextual, right? And
so the environment really matters.

727
00:42:03,261 --> 00:42:06,680
And if like you're sitting in
a Starbucks having a Latte, um,

728
00:42:07,190 --> 00:42:10,250
it's going to be a really boring first
day you're going to do a resume exchange

729
00:42:10,251 --> 00:42:13,670
and you're like, I don't know. She wasn't
that interesting. Um, it was just, I just,

730
00:42:13,671 --> 00:42:16,360
there was no spark there.
So Rob said, oh, the,

731
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:19,970
the first thing that people do wrong
and what you should try to do if you're

732
00:42:19,971 --> 00:42:21,350
dating is you need to,

733
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:25,010
you need to follow the monster
truck rally theory of first dates.

734
00:42:25,190 --> 00:42:30,190
And that is every first day it should
be in some place that's like super

735
00:42:30,741 --> 00:42:34,280
interesting and kind of quirky and
it's going to make you laugh kind of no

736
00:42:34,281 --> 00:42:35,570
matter what you're doing.

737
00:42:35,990 --> 00:42:40,370
And it should be kind of surprising and
kind of fun monster truck rallies he

738
00:42:40,371 --> 00:42:43,310
likes because especially for like
the overeducated tech, you know,

739
00:42:43,340 --> 00:42:45,020
silicon valley people,
you know,

740
00:42:45,021 --> 00:42:47,450
you probably don't spend a lot
of time at monster truck rallies.

741
00:42:47,570 --> 00:42:49,970
But if someone said like, Hey, let's go
to a monster truck rally, you'd be like,

742
00:42:50,030 --> 00:42:53,000
Whoa, that seems like a really interesting
and fun idea we're going to do it.

743
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:56,390
And it's like the quality of the whole
interaction and the quality of the

744
00:42:56,391 --> 00:42:57,710
evening is going to be really great.

745
00:42:58,040 --> 00:43:00,170
And so you don't have to go
to a monster truck rally,

746
00:43:00,171 --> 00:43:01,910
but the idea is like for your first date,

747
00:43:02,270 --> 00:43:06,170
do something that's like you always
really wanted to do on your own,

748
00:43:06,171 --> 00:43:09,170
but you just don't have enough time and
use the date as an excuse to go do that

749
00:43:09,171 --> 00:43:13,310
fun thing with another person. It makes
sense. Okay. That's tip number one.

750
00:43:13,970 --> 00:43:16,880
Okay. Now this one, you probably,

751
00:43:16,910 --> 00:43:19,400
you probably studied this in your um,

752
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:22,460
social science classes in
college or graduate school.

753
00:43:22,670 --> 00:43:23,960
You probably familiar with the flow,
right?

754
00:43:23,961 --> 00:43:27,300
A theory of acquired likability
through repetition. You.

755
00:43:27,330 --> 00:43:31,580
You remember that one now? Okay, fine.

756
00:43:31,820 --> 00:43:33,380
Um,
uh,

757
00:43:33,381 --> 00:43:36,890
at the end of this talk I want you to
resubscribe to the American Sociological

758
00:43:36,890 --> 00:43:40,640
Review and review your psychology notes
from, from college. Okay. The flow ride,

759
00:43:40,641 --> 00:43:45,500
a theory of acquired likeability through
repetition is basically tells us that

760
00:43:45,530 --> 00:43:48,350
in the end people are pretty
much like flo rider songs,

761
00:43:48,950 --> 00:43:52,040
which is you hear them the first
time you're like, I don't know,

762
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:56,930
I've heard that song. I don't know
this. The flow riders has same song.

763
00:43:56,931 --> 00:44:00,020
It's not that interesting. Ah, I
don't need another one of these.

764
00:44:00,380 --> 00:44:03,380
But then if you keep listening to
the flow rider song again and again,

765
00:44:03,381 --> 00:44:07,880
you're like, oh my God, Flo rider,
you are amazing. I love that song.

766
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:12,350
It turns out we have very
similar responses to people
that if you have like a

767
00:44:12,351 --> 00:44:14,540
second date,
a third date,

768
00:44:14,810 --> 00:44:19,810
the things that are
specific and interesting and
distinctive about people are

769
00:44:20,541 --> 00:44:23,270
not actually the what they look like.
It's,

770
00:44:23,340 --> 00:44:26,090
there are things that come
out in interactions over time.

771
00:44:26,510 --> 00:44:31,160
And the big mistake that data is
generally make is they tend to overvalue

772
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:36,210
superficial things on the first date.
Like hotness and,

773
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:40,140
and, and undervalue things that, right?
Because we all know that that kind of the,

774
00:44:40,141 --> 00:44:42,780
the temperature of the hotness is
going to decrease no matter what.

775
00:44:44,010 --> 00:44:47,760
No matter who it is that you're
dating. Right. And we probably,

776
00:44:47,761 --> 00:44:50,130
everyone in this room wants like dated
someone who they thought was way more

777
00:44:50,131 --> 00:44:53,100
attractive than them and they're like,
I can't believe I'm actually dating her.

778
00:44:53,370 --> 00:44:55,140
And then like on the third
day, like, oh my God,

779
00:44:55,141 --> 00:44:57,480
I have nothing to say to this person.
Right?

780
00:44:57,481 --> 00:45:00,570
So we tend to overvalue hotness and
we tend to undervalue the things that

781
00:45:00,571 --> 00:45:03,780
actually really matter to us
over time and in relationships.

782
00:45:03,930 --> 00:45:07,380
And those are things that tend to
come out over repeated exposure and

783
00:45:07,381 --> 00:45:11,160
interactions, right? Which not to
say like attraction doesn't matter.

784
00:45:11,161 --> 00:45:13,440
Of course in traction matters,
there's a baseline that you have to hit,

785
00:45:13,590 --> 00:45:16,990
but there are a lot of people
who are like, I dunno, she
seemed pretty cool. Yeah.

786
00:45:16,991 --> 00:45:18,270
If she,
I guess she was pretty attractive.

787
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:21,240
There just wasn't that spark on the first
time. You're like, what'd you do? Oh,

788
00:45:21,241 --> 00:45:23,400
we were at a bowling alley
bowling. That sounds so fun. Oh No.

789
00:45:23,401 --> 00:45:25,920
We were in the lounge having a coke.
You know,

790
00:45:26,010 --> 00:45:28,620
you're never going to fall in love with
someone in a bowling alley lounge on a

791
00:45:28,621 --> 00:45:32,550
first date over coke. It was a bad way to
fall in love. So give someone a chance.

792
00:45:32,551 --> 00:45:34,560
That's the second one.
And then the third one,

793
00:45:34,561 --> 00:45:37,680
this might be the most practical
thing. Um, I want to leave you with,

794
00:45:38,610 --> 00:45:42,130
so there's another kind of dilemma and
problem that people have in a world where

795
00:45:42,131 --> 00:45:44,850
we all, a lot of our relationships
are online and that is like, okay,

796
00:45:44,851 --> 00:45:46,920
you start dating somebody
or with them for a while.

797
00:45:47,070 --> 00:45:49,740
You build up this relationship,
you have all these friends in common,

798
00:45:49,890 --> 00:45:51,810
you not only share experiences together,

799
00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:54,540
you now share phone world
and a digital life together.

800
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:57,510
Like you posting pictures of her and him,
they're all over it.

801
00:45:57,511 --> 00:46:00,570
You're all over Instagram and Facebook,
that your lives are totally intertwined.

802
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:02,700
And then he break up and
now you've got this problem,

803
00:46:02,850 --> 00:46:06,660
which is that like you can't get rid of
this person from your history and you

804
00:46:06,661 --> 00:46:09,690
want to go back and like look
at the picture of vacation
pictures or pictures of

805
00:46:09,691 --> 00:46:12,750
yourself at party, see like the
friends or the experiences you had.

806
00:46:12,751 --> 00:46:16,320
But every time you do it, you have
a photograph of your acts with you.

807
00:46:16,620 --> 00:46:20,540
And so as these, and I found a great
strategy for dealing with this, uh,

808
00:46:20,820 --> 00:46:22,980
it's just called [inaudible] and your ex.

809
00:46:23,190 --> 00:46:25,590
And what that means is it doesn't
have to be Beyonce, by the way.

810
00:46:25,591 --> 00:46:29,310
You can do this with Sonia
Sotomayor. Um, you could do it with,

811
00:46:29,311 --> 00:46:32,550
you could choose Rick Perry. Uh, there's
any number of people you could do.

812
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:33,980
Basically you want to pick a,

813
00:46:33,990 --> 00:46:38,430
a fairly well known person and just get
an image of their face and just paste it

814
00:46:38,431 --> 00:46:42,060
over the image of your acts all over
the Internet and that will solve all of

815
00:46:42,061 --> 00:46:44,530
your problems. So thank you very much. Um,

816
00:46:45,080 --> 00:46:46,280
I really enjoyed the conversation.

817
00:46:51,050 --> 00:46:52,010
I hope that was useful.

818
00:46:52,820 --> 00:46:54,660
Hi. So, um, yeah,

819
00:46:54,661 --> 00:46:59,090
I was really light in to hear
about how your findings disproved,

820
00:46:59,091 --> 00:47:02,540
like that really popular study
that you said it was unfounded,

821
00:47:02,541 --> 00:47:07,541
that people are actually lonelier now
than before about that or the study that

822
00:47:08,780 --> 00:47:10,690
that showed that people were looking.
Yeah,

823
00:47:10,810 --> 00:47:15,650
it kind of like brought to my mind this
quote that got circulated shortly after

824
00:47:16,430 --> 00:47:19,730
the death of Robin Williams,
which I think I'm going to misquote it,

825
00:47:19,731 --> 00:47:22,790
but it's this phenomenon
of the worst thing is,

826
00:47:22,791 --> 00:47:26,480
and to be alone but is to be around
people who make you feel alone.

827
00:47:26,810 --> 00:47:28,910
So I guess from your studies,
how do you,

828
00:47:29,260 --> 00:47:33,610
that like technology has contributed
to that feeling and like what do you

829
00:47:33,611 --> 00:47:37,660
actually call that? Yeah, so that's a
really interesting question. So, um,

830
00:47:38,650 --> 00:47:43,650
there is this issue that's a little bit
related to the problem of choice that I

831
00:47:44,141 --> 00:47:46,010
brought up before.
Uh,

832
00:47:46,090 --> 00:47:51,090
and that is that many people today find
it very difficult to be where they are.

833
00:47:55,990 --> 00:47:56,890
So

834
00:47:59,050 --> 00:48:03,520
think about the last hour that
we've spent together. You know, now,

835
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:04,473
um,

836
00:48:05,020 --> 00:48:09,700
it's very hard for most people to spend
an hour without checking their phone to

837
00:48:09,701 --> 00:48:13,540
see what's happened. Did anybody check
your phone in the last hour? Come on.

838
00:48:14,350 --> 00:48:16,450
This is the greatest hour of my life then.
I mean,

839
00:48:16,990 --> 00:48:20,130
everybody checks their phone
all the time. And you know, I,

840
00:48:20,131 --> 00:48:22,810
I know like I've don't take it personally
that you checked your phone in the

841
00:48:22,810 --> 00:48:24,010
last hour.
We are hooked on these things.

842
00:48:24,011 --> 00:48:26,080
We were looking for this new stimulation,
right?

843
00:48:26,081 --> 00:48:30,970
We wondering what's going on in our
personal life and our home life.

844
00:48:31,180 --> 00:48:35,770
Um, w w who won the soccer game. Uh,

845
00:48:35,771 --> 00:48:38,470
there's all sorts of information
that we could be getting at any time,

846
00:48:38,590 --> 00:48:40,840
which is actually generally
not all that urgent,

847
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:45,550
but were somehow in this cultural
moment where not everyone,

848
00:48:45,551 --> 00:48:49,630
but a lot of us are kind of hungry
for the next new burst of information.

849
00:48:49,630 --> 00:48:51,760
Like we want that adrenaline rush,

850
00:48:51,910 --> 00:48:54,640
that endorphin kick that we're going
to get from getting the new thing.

851
00:48:54,910 --> 00:48:59,910
And so we're constantly
failing to appreciate the
place we're in and the people

852
00:49:01,811 --> 00:49:02,644
we're with.

853
00:49:03,370 --> 00:49:08,370
And what I oftentimes think now is like
unless you are sitting directly across

854
00:49:09,701 --> 00:49:14,200
to or next to a person you have met in
the last three weeks and are currently in

855
00:49:14,201 --> 00:49:16,000
the process of falling
deeply in love with,

856
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:20,350
there's almost no thing that you're going
to be doing that's going to completely

857
00:49:20,351 --> 00:49:24,160
distract you from like the buzzing noises
you're phone is making in your pocket.

858
00:49:25,090 --> 00:49:28,900
Right? It's very hard for people
to focus on where they are.

859
00:49:29,230 --> 00:49:30,590
And so what,
you know,

860
00:49:30,610 --> 00:49:35,610
what happens is it becomes very easy
to degrade the quality of everyday

861
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:41,710
interactions and to take your
relationships for granted. And I do,

862
00:49:41,770 --> 00:49:42,760
I do worry about that.

863
00:49:42,761 --> 00:49:45,580
So that's not exactly kind of
the loneliness of being alone.

864
00:49:45,580 --> 00:49:50,080
It's a different kind of experience. Now,
interestingly, that doesn't show up on,

865
00:49:50,430 --> 00:49:55,210
uh, surveys of how lonely people are, the
best measures we have of for loneliness.

866
00:49:55,211 --> 00:49:56,380
Don't tap into that.

867
00:49:56,620 --> 00:49:59,890
But I do think that that's a phenomenon
that that's worth paying attention to.

868
00:50:00,190 --> 00:50:03,010
And I'll tell you something from the
going solo project that was very powerful

869
00:50:03,011 --> 00:50:04,190
to me.
Um,

870
00:50:04,630 --> 00:50:09,460
so many people I interviewed who had
lived with someone and who then, uh,

871
00:50:09,510 --> 00:50:11,710
you know, get separated and became
single and they've done their own, said,

872
00:50:11,711 --> 00:50:14,140
you know,
my friends are always worried about me.

873
00:50:14,141 --> 00:50:17,110
They asked me if I'm lonely
and what I tell them is yes,

874
00:50:17,410 --> 00:50:22,090
there are moments of real pain when I'm
home by myself single and thinking about

875
00:50:22,091 --> 00:50:25,540
what my future is going to be like.
But I'll tell you the truth.

876
00:50:26,140 --> 00:50:30,200
There's nothing than a bad relationship.

877
00:50:30,780 --> 00:50:33,110
There's nothing lonelier than
living with the wrong person.

878
00:50:34,750 --> 00:50:39,420
That is very true. Okay. Eric,
thanks so much for coming.

879
00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:42,420
Um, so you brought up the topic of, um,

880
00:50:42,540 --> 00:50:46,890
now we're more searching for our
soul mate other than just a spouse.

881
00:50:46,891 --> 00:50:51,280
That's good enough. Um, and I
noticed that even now that we're, uh,

882
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:54,060
some people even find that
soul is not good enough.

883
00:50:54,090 --> 00:50:57,090
They want something more than saw
me. Well, what's that twin flame?

884
00:50:57,480 --> 00:51:02,070
What twin flame. Oh, that's so weird. It's
a new thing. Yeah. It's like, so may plus.

885
00:51:02,071 --> 00:51:06,240
Plus, are there actually any
research saying that finding
your soul mate actually

886
00:51:06,241 --> 00:51:10,290
makes you happier? Because I'm very
skeptical about, uh, oh no, no,

887
00:51:10,291 --> 00:51:14,440
there's no research like that. No, I mean
there really isn't. And so, so it's not,

888
00:51:14,441 --> 00:51:15,580
it's not as if,
you know,

889
00:51:15,581 --> 00:51:20,410
what I'm reporting to you is that
in fact people find their soulmates.

890
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:21,070
Um,

891
00:51:21,070 --> 00:51:24,520
and we know that if you find your soulmate
and match on all the key criteria of

892
00:51:24,521 --> 00:51:29,290
like what constitutes a soul, then
you'll be okay. You'll be happy. I mean,

893
00:51:29,350 --> 00:51:33,100
we don't have that, right. So people are
optimizing for a random set of things.

894
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:35,330
And one thing we do know is that,
um,

895
00:51:35,410 --> 00:51:39,070
we're terrible at knowing what it
is that we want and another person.

896
00:51:39,550 --> 00:51:42,460
And what the reason we know this is
because of all the great data that we get

897
00:51:42,461 --> 00:51:45,340
from, um, from dating sites
where people, you know,

898
00:51:45,341 --> 00:51:47,860
like you go on match.com and you say like,

899
00:51:47,861 --> 00:51:51,640
here are the five things I'm looking
for. You know, like I want a blonde,

900
00:51:51,970 --> 00:51:56,970
a woman who has a phd from an Ivy
League school in the natural sciences,

901
00:51:57,221 --> 00:51:58,900
not the social sciences,
right?

902
00:51:58,901 --> 00:52:03,901
And she has to like skiing and be pro
choice and then like you like turn out

903
00:52:04,811 --> 00:52:07,840
that if you, if you look at what
that person is actually choosing,

904
00:52:08,020 --> 00:52:10,480
like who is that person asking out?
Right?

905
00:52:10,870 --> 00:52:14,740
They're like tall brunettes who grew
up in the south and have a high school

906
00:52:14,741 --> 00:52:18,730
degree, right? And like volleyball
and vote for Republicans.

907
00:52:19,030 --> 00:52:22,450
And it turns out that that like we're
just really shitty it knowing what it is

908
00:52:22,451 --> 00:52:24,280
that makes us happy.
And so,

909
00:52:24,281 --> 00:52:27,820
so like the kind of research that
you're asking for of like how, you know,

910
00:52:27,821 --> 00:52:32,020
how are we actually matching is
really hard to come by. That said,

911
00:52:32,420 --> 00:52:35,200
um, oh and I should say
one other thing. Uh,

912
00:52:35,290 --> 00:52:39,220
there's actually a really interesting
research on arranged marriages because as

913
00:52:39,221 --> 00:52:42,520
these parents had an arranged marriage
and we talked about this a lot,

914
00:52:42,521 --> 00:52:45,040
like we did interviews with them when
we looked into the research on arranged

915
00:52:45,041 --> 00:52:46,600
marriages.
Um,

916
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:49,750
like at some point we were
sitting together doing
research and I start cracking

917
00:52:49,751 --> 00:52:52,720
up because it's easy to
just told me how his,

918
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:55,790
his father met his wife and
married his wife were found,

919
00:52:55,791 --> 00:52:58,330
has found his wife and his story,
it was like he,

920
00:52:58,450 --> 00:53:00,280
his parents decided it was
time for him to get married.

921
00:53:00,490 --> 00:53:04,150
They like introduce them to
one woman and she was too tall.

922
00:53:04,420 --> 00:53:07,970
And then they introduced them to the
woman who became his wife and she was,

923
00:53:07,990 --> 00:53:09,340
it was like the right,
that was the right decision.

924
00:53:09,610 --> 00:53:13,030
And it occurred to me that actually like
as he spends more time trying to figure

925
00:53:13,031 --> 00:53:16,600
out where to get a Taco,
then his father spent figuring out who,

926
00:53:16,601 --> 00:53:17,860
which was the right woman to marry.

927
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:21,160
Like if you ever wanted to eat
with Aziz is incredibly difficult.

928
00:53:21,161 --> 00:53:25,030
Like he's totally an optimizer
and maximizer and he does
like enormous amounts

929
00:53:25,110 --> 00:53:28,200
research on everything because why would
you ever want to have the second best

930
00:53:28,201 --> 00:53:32,550
Taco in the East village? Um, and
that can be really difficult. But his,

931
00:53:32,551 --> 00:53:35,520
but his step father or his father went
through this like pretty simple process.

932
00:53:35,521 --> 00:53:39,330
And it turns out with her and arranged
marriages, there's this idea like,

933
00:53:39,780 --> 00:53:43,670
you know, when the marriage begins,
there's kind of like a simmer,

934
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:44,700
like just a little bit of heat.

935
00:53:44,700 --> 00:53:48,210
And then over the course of
time in successful marriages,

936
00:53:48,211 --> 00:53:50,940
you kind of build up to
the boil and the intimacy.

937
00:53:51,240 --> 00:53:55,350
And actually the record on arranged
marriage is pretty strong in terms of

938
00:53:55,351 --> 00:53:56,610
longevity compare and,

939
00:53:56,611 --> 00:54:00,960
and people's feelings about the quality
of the marriage compared to our system

940
00:54:00,961 --> 00:54:05,700
of like marrying the person you want to
marry by choice after having search for

941
00:54:05,701 --> 00:54:08,550
your soulmate. So that, I think there's
really, really good reason to be,

942
00:54:08,820 --> 00:54:11,430
to be skeptical, you know,
of that. But what we do know,

943
00:54:11,431 --> 00:54:16,431
I was gonna say that said is that there
does seem to be some value in waiting

944
00:54:17,250 --> 00:54:19,710
until later in life to get married.

945
00:54:19,980 --> 00:54:23,720
And we do know that there's a lot
of volatility in people's, you know,

946
00:54:23,850 --> 00:54:24,960
formative years,

947
00:54:25,320 --> 00:54:27,860
both in terms of your life where you know
where you are and what you're going to

948
00:54:27,861 --> 00:54:31,830
do and in terms of your character
development. And so, you know,

949
00:54:31,831 --> 00:54:35,430
people who marry younger without having
gone through that search are just more

950
00:54:35,431 --> 00:54:37,710
likely to have the relationships burnout.

951
00:54:38,370 --> 00:54:41,790
So that was a somewhat of noxious and
long winded answer to your really smart

952
00:54:41,791 --> 00:54:46,410
question. So my question,
um, focuses on cohabitation.

953
00:54:46,980 --> 00:54:48,360
So the,
you know,

954
00:54:48,361 --> 00:54:51,540
the fulfillment of happiness when you're
living with someone kind of depends on

955
00:54:52,100 --> 00:54:55,530
like your level of sloppiness. Can the
other person cook, did they clean up?

956
00:54:55,560 --> 00:54:58,200
You know, like all those things they
got to be biographical about this.

957
00:54:58,201 --> 00:54:59,760
But from what I understand,

958
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:04,390
cleaning up after yourself. Yeah. So my,

959
00:55:04,470 --> 00:55:07,860
my question is what's the research
or your, if there isn't research,

960
00:55:07,861 --> 00:55:09,900
what's your personal opinion on,
you know,

961
00:55:09,930 --> 00:55:13,260
our couples more successful if
they live together or apart?

962
00:55:14,710 --> 00:55:17,400
Let's do you know, people who might
have different houses or apartments,

963
00:55:17,401 --> 00:55:20,550
but they're married for
example. Yeah, I don't,

964
00:55:20,610 --> 00:55:23,160
I don't know this debate as
much as I should probably.

965
00:55:24,570 --> 00:55:28,530
I have a memory of reading studies
showing that actually there was a

966
00:55:28,531 --> 00:55:32,640
relationship between cohabitation
and separation down the road,

967
00:55:32,641 --> 00:55:37,641
that people were more likely to ultimately
divorce if they cohabitated before

968
00:55:37,741 --> 00:55:38,550
marriage.

969
00:55:38,550 --> 00:55:42,210
But that was just like a
simple correlation and then
it turns out if you tease,

970
00:55:42,270 --> 00:55:45,720
tease it out, there was something about
the composition of the population,

971
00:55:45,721 --> 00:55:49,440
like people who are more likely to live
together first were also more likely to

972
00:55:49,441 --> 00:55:53,430
be in a population of people get
divorced. So to be honest, I don't,

973
00:55:53,431 --> 00:55:55,590
I can't give you like the state
of the art finding on that,

974
00:55:56,100 --> 00:56:00,360
but there's definitely a lot of
research on it. Um, definitely not.

975
00:56:00,390 --> 00:56:03,040
Definitely not writing about that issue.
Um,

976
00:56:03,880 --> 00:56:06,690
because it would be weird because I,
okay so I'm married,

977
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:08,160
I want to be clear about that.

978
00:56:08,220 --> 00:56:11,970
Which was very difficult for me when I
was doing the going solo book cause I was

979
00:56:11,971 --> 00:56:14,940
like inadvertently became this
person who like Eric Klinenberg.

980
00:56:14,940 --> 00:56:17,820
We'll talk about the joys of singlehood,
which is not like that.

981
00:56:17,821 --> 00:56:19,620
What I was not what I was going for,

982
00:56:19,621 --> 00:56:22,810
but I wound up like writing this book
about how actually people who live alone

983
00:56:22,811 --> 00:56:26,110
and I didn't even, you know, like
they're very social, they tended to like,

984
00:56:26,130 --> 00:56:28,390
turns out the happiness levels
are much higher than we thought.

985
00:56:28,630 --> 00:56:30,970
And then so I would get invited to
all these like singles, you know,

986
00:56:30,971 --> 00:56:34,840
celebrate single. And my
poor wife was like, you know,

987
00:56:34,841 --> 00:56:36,550
at first I thought this was like,

988
00:56:36,551 --> 00:56:39,820
you're kind of escape fantasy book and
now I'm getting a little bit worried

989
00:56:39,821 --> 00:56:43,710
about this, this project. And then
I started writing a book, you know,

990
00:56:43,720 --> 00:56:48,220
about how young people
like hook up basically.

991
00:56:48,670 --> 00:56:53,570
And that was spacious.
And so if I'm like,

992
00:56:53,590 --> 00:56:56,570
yeah. And then my wife and I did
cohabitate before we got married.

993
00:56:56,571 --> 00:57:01,430
So if I got really deep
into that question, she,

994
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:04,400
you know, she probably already
has a lot of doubts to begin with.

995
00:57:05,510 --> 00:57:08,510
So the thing is a bad idea.
Yeah. I'm not going to do that,

996
00:57:10,190 --> 00:57:11,420
but thanks for the suggestion.

997
00:57:13,310 --> 00:57:17,770
Uh, so if you learn a lot more
about yourself as you grow up, uh,

998
00:57:18,070 --> 00:57:21,570
and you're supposed to wait, you
till you get older as you marry, uh,

999
00:57:21,730 --> 00:57:23,440
w what are you supposed
to do in the meantime?

1000
00:57:24,130 --> 00:57:29,000
Like I just graduated from college. I
just like told him my thumbs for 14 or 17.

1001
00:57:29,010 --> 00:57:31,640
Know this guy who's sitting next to
you? You guys ever met? No, he's, look,

1002
00:57:31,641 --> 00:57:32,620
yeah cause you're looking at here like

1003
00:57:32,910 --> 00:57:37,550
what the fuck are you talking
about? What I use? Are you serious?

1004
00:57:37,780 --> 00:57:42,330
No bike Blake. Shit, you're single in
the bay area and you work at Google.

1005
00:57:42,331 --> 00:57:44,960
What do you mean what are you supposed to
be doing in the next day? No, no, but, but

1006
00:57:46,530 --> 00:57:50,100
you guys talk after this.
He's going to tell you where to go.

1007
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:55,460
Well wake, should you date
people seriously? Like you
know, like the idea of like,

1008
00:57:55,461 --> 00:57:59,810
should you be in your long plus
relationships or should you be,

1009
00:58:00,170 --> 00:58:02,510
you know, trying out more. I don't know.

1010
00:58:02,511 --> 00:58:04,610
I mean just kind of curious
what the research says.

1011
00:58:09,420 --> 00:58:11,850
I'm going to let you know what I have
decided to do. I'm just going to have put,

1012
00:58:11,851 --> 00:58:12,060
like,

1013
00:58:12,060 --> 00:58:14,430
I'm going to work in one of these private
offices after the talk and I'm just

1014
00:58:14,431 --> 00:58:15,750
going to take you like one at a time.

1015
00:58:15,751 --> 00:58:18,320
Like I kind of like the haircut
truck you guys have on campus.

1016
00:58:20,040 --> 00:58:23,340
I'd be like a relationship
adviser and you can just come,

1017
00:58:23,341 --> 00:58:26,400
you have to pay for the haircuts
here, right? So like the Tacos,

1018
00:58:26,460 --> 00:58:28,920
the Tacos are free, but you got to pay
for the haircut. So you'll probably,

1019
00:58:28,921 --> 00:58:32,800
I'm going to charge for these sessions,
but you could come. No, I look,

1020
00:58:33,610 --> 00:58:37,400
I think there's value in being in
relationships and you know, if you meet,

1021
00:58:37,460 --> 00:58:39,070
if you're,
if you meet someone who is,

1022
00:58:39,100 --> 00:58:44,010
you have a wonderful connection with
and um, you're, it really gels and you,

1023
00:58:44,011 --> 00:58:48,040
you know, it's like the right thing.
I'm not trying to say, you know, it's,

1024
00:58:48,220 --> 00:58:49,870
that's a crazy thing, right? Like I,

1025
00:58:49,910 --> 00:58:53,230
I'm a social scientist and I'm thinking
about large population samples and I'm

1026
00:58:53,231 --> 00:58:58,150
thinking probabilistically, right? So, in
your case of one person, you, you know,

1027
00:58:58,151 --> 00:58:59,980
you,
you're going to know what's right for you,

1028
00:58:59,981 --> 00:59:04,830
better than a sociologist who's looking
at big populations. Um, you know,

1029
00:59:05,470 --> 00:59:10,060
that said, um, uh, you
know, I think there's,

1030
00:59:10,210 --> 00:59:11,970
there's lots of value in
being in relationships.

1031
00:59:11,980 --> 00:59:14,680
There's lots of value and having
intimate experiences with someone else.

1032
00:59:14,890 --> 00:59:17,110
There's no rush to get married,

1033
00:59:17,350 --> 00:59:20,320
certainly in a rush to get married
and have children. Um, you know,

1034
00:59:20,321 --> 00:59:23,990
once you start to in these parts of your
life that things get difficult and if

1035
00:59:23,991 --> 00:59:27,650
you wind up changing in ways that were
unpredictable, um, you know, you're,

1036
00:59:27,651 --> 00:59:30,630
you find that you're, you're constrained.
And it's interesting like this,

1037
00:59:30,631 --> 00:59:33,920
this is really a deep thing about the
cultural situation we find ourselves in.

1038
00:59:34,280 --> 00:59:36,890
Um,
since the late 19th century,

1039
00:59:36,891 --> 00:59:40,490
there has been a concept in sociology
that I like quite a lot called the cult of

1040
00:59:40,491 --> 00:59:41,324
the individual.

1041
00:59:41,570 --> 00:59:46,400
And it refers to the way in
modern life that we have come to,

1042
00:59:46,580 --> 00:59:51,440
to value. Uh, the, the what's good for me,

1043
00:59:52,070 --> 00:59:54,740
what's good for the individual
as opposed to what's good,

1044
00:59:55,250 --> 00:59:58,640
what's good for the collective
that I'm a part of. Right.

1045
00:59:59,390 --> 01:00:02,870
And there's kind of a famous line
about, you know, w w why would,

1046
01:00:03,080 --> 01:00:07,840
why would a family and trust something
as important as marriage to, uh,

1047
01:00:08,050 --> 01:00:12,440
like other people getting married?
The marriage is not about two people.

1048
01:00:12,790 --> 01:00:15,710
When two people get married, it's
a, it's a, you know, it's a family.

1049
01:00:15,830 --> 01:00:19,580
It's a family event. It's
structures, groups of people.

1050
01:00:19,820 --> 01:00:23,870
Why would you let two young, stupid people
make a decision like that? Right? So,

1051
01:00:23,960 --> 01:00:28,960
so what's happened over time is that
our sense that our behavior should be

1052
01:00:28,971 --> 01:00:32,780
oriented towards optimizing
the group experience,

1053
01:00:34,060 --> 01:00:38,000
right? The group wellbeing
has been replaced by a notion
that our behavior should

1054
01:00:38,001 --> 01:00:42,260
optimize our individual condition.

1055
01:00:43,700 --> 01:00:44,533
Right?

1056
01:00:45,070 --> 01:00:48,800
It used to be the case that if you were
in a bad marriage and you were really

1057
01:00:48,801 --> 01:00:51,980
unhappy and you want it to get divorced,
not very long ago,

1058
01:00:51,981 --> 01:00:54,380
you would have to justify to your friends,

1059
01:00:54,381 --> 01:00:58,040
into your family this decision to get
divorced. This was the wrong thing to do.

1060
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,850
But now if you're in a bad
marriage and you're really unhappy,

1061
01:01:02,180 --> 01:01:05,450
you'll have to justify it to your friends
and family, why you should stay in it.

1062
01:01:06,290 --> 01:01:10,910
Because our notion is like if you as an
individual aren't fulfilled and getting

1063
01:01:10,911 --> 01:01:14,360
what you need than it is wrong for you to
be in that situation. So our, you know,

1064
01:01:14,600 --> 01:01:17,600
our values have really shifted on this.
Um,

1065
01:01:18,230 --> 01:01:20,040
and so the,
you know,

1066
01:01:20,060 --> 01:01:24,110
that's when we talk about like don't put
yourself in a binding situation that,

1067
01:01:24,140 --> 01:01:26,900
um, is going to be difficult for you
down the line depending on who developed.

1068
01:01:26,910 --> 01:01:27,350
That's it.

1069
01:01:27,350 --> 01:01:30,230
I just want to call attention to my
own response to what you're saying,

1070
01:01:30,231 --> 01:01:30,920
which is like,

1071
01:01:30,920 --> 01:01:35,090
that is rooted in a very specific
cultural understanding of what constitutes

1072
01:01:35,091 --> 01:01:38,870
good behavior in a good life. And
it is quite remarkable. I, you know,

1073
01:01:38,871 --> 01:01:40,340
I've found throughout these projects,

1074
01:01:40,341 --> 01:01:45,341
I've done the extent to which our sense
of what's good ethical behavior is

1075
01:01:45,501 --> 01:01:50,240
rooted in our commitment to ourselves
as individuals, as the prime actors.

1076
01:01:50,540 --> 01:01:54,740
So that was a great way for me to
dodge the substance of your question.

1077
01:01:55,270 --> 01:01:58,550
Well, I'm saying something, you
know, marginally interesting. Okay,

1078
01:01:59,560 --> 01:02:01,160
final question. So, uh,

1079
01:02:01,300 --> 01:02:06,300
what you'll be writing about next
and who you hope that call is from.

1080
01:02:07,180 --> 01:02:10,320
So you got to meet a zs. You didn't know
that he was curious about this topic.

1081
01:02:10,660 --> 01:02:13,210
If there's anybody else that you'd
like to partner with, who would it?

1082
01:02:13,530 --> 01:02:18,000
Oh Wow. So I'm writing now book about
what I call social infrastructure.

1083
01:02:19,350 --> 01:02:22,330
And those are the places and,
um,

1084
01:02:22,890 --> 01:02:27,360
institutions that shape the way we
interact and actually, um, plead a Google.

1085
01:02:27,361 --> 01:02:31,790
One of the things I really want to
study is, um, workplaces and how, um,

1086
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:36,220
how can you design a, a
workplace so that you, um,

1087
01:02:36,600 --> 01:02:41,530
facilitate interactions and promote
cohesion and connection. Um,

1088
01:02:41,580 --> 01:02:43,500
and while I'm here in the bay area,

1089
01:02:43,501 --> 01:02:45,300
I'd really like to know
more about what Google does.

1090
01:02:45,301 --> 01:02:48,960
So if anyone here happens to work at
Google or you're connected to anyone who

1091
01:02:48,961 --> 01:02:53,550
works at Google and you could help me,
I would really appreciate that. Uh,

1092
01:02:54,180 --> 01:02:55,260
um,
I'll even,

1093
01:02:55,290 --> 01:03:00,240
I'll give you back all of my speaker's
fee speaking fee for today is the lecture.

1094
01:03:00,241 --> 01:03:04,950
I will refund 100% of my
speaker's fee, um, for, for that,

1095
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:09,090
uh, information. So I would
love to, I actually love to
learn more about Google, um,

1096
01:03:09,120 --> 01:03:09,953
and writing that book.

1097
01:03:10,260 --> 01:03:15,260
And who would I be unable to say no to
if they called me and asked if I could

1098
01:03:16,471 --> 01:03:19,720
write a book with them?
I don't,

1099
01:03:19,950 --> 01:03:22,860
I haven't even thought about that
question. Can I get back to you on that?

1100
01:03:23,460 --> 01:03:28,260
Sergey and Larry,
now those chomps,

1101
01:03:28,261 --> 01:03:32,700
what do they know? Um, now, um, I
don't know. I don't know. I got,

1102
01:03:32,710 --> 01:03:36,630
it's such a good question. Dammit. I
wish I knew the answer to that question.

1103
01:03:37,380 --> 01:03:41,560
Continue that. I'm going to think
about it. Taking suggestions. Uh,

1104
01:03:42,390 --> 01:03:46,230
Hu [inaudible] Daniel Conaman.
Oh yeah,

1105
01:03:46,560 --> 01:03:48,210
he's got a new book
about him already though.

1106
01:03:48,450 --> 01:03:52,460
It's probably better than what I
could do a confirming. Say that again.

1107
01:03:52,580 --> 01:03:54,730
Nick Offerman, you continue the
parks and directories. Actually,

1108
01:03:54,750 --> 01:03:56,240
I did get a call from,
um,

1109
01:03:56,310 --> 01:04:00,450
key and peels agents right after the book
came and asked me if I would come and

1110
01:04:00,451 --> 01:04:01,080
talk to them.

1111
01:04:01,080 --> 01:04:04,560
And then I got really scared that I
would just become known as that social

1112
01:04:04,561 --> 01:04:08,880
scientists who writes with
Comedians, uh, and I didn't do it.

1113
01:04:08,881 --> 01:04:10,800
So plus,
as you can all tell,

1114
01:04:10,801 --> 01:04:14,640
like what really happened to me as I
developed this like fantasy that I too

1115
01:04:14,641 --> 01:04:19,300
would someday become a comedian and find
a social scientist to write with me. Um,

1116
01:04:19,730 --> 01:04:23,370
but I think we're a long, long way
from that happy day. So are we done?

1117
01:04:23,430 --> 01:04:25,030
[inaudible] thank you.

1118
01:04:25,360 --> 01:04:29,900
[inaudible].
