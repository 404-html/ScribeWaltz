1
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:10,870
Nikola Tesla, um, you guys getting
a bit of a popular revival, um,

2
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:15,050
imparts as we were mentioning.
Um, it's because your boss, um,

3
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:19,030
not long ago refer to him as a hero.
Everybody's thinking, oh my gosh,

4
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:23,110
if Larry Page thinks he's a hero,
maybe we need to learn a little bit more.

5
00:00:23,111 --> 00:00:28,111
And then suddenly Elon Musk decides that
he's got a car company and you know,

6
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:33,760
a, a, a car that's named after this
character. So, um, who the heck is he?

7
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:38,350
There's sort of two broad categories of
at least those folks that sort of know

8
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:39,610
something about him.

9
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:44,320
At least my experience is one says that
he's the superman that has provided us

10
00:00:44,321 --> 00:00:48,010
these amazing inventions
that underlying our economy.

11
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:52,420
The other side says that he's
kind of quirky. Like he's
an odd character. I mean,

12
00:00:52,421 --> 00:00:56,680
he, you know, upper whores
jewelry, he gets a fever,

13
00:00:56,681 --> 00:01:00,790
or if he looks at a peach,
he counts his steps as he walks in.

14
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:02,290
If they're not divisible by three,

15
00:01:02,291 --> 00:01:05,650
he has to go back and do as
an whole journey again. Um,

16
00:01:05,651 --> 00:01:09,010
so that you've got this sort of contrast.
But I guess what I want to do for,

17
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,270
you know, maybe about
20, 25 minutes or so,

18
00:01:11,271 --> 00:01:16,271
I always talk a bit about
some observations that I
came up with in the course of

19
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:21,130
doing the research. Things that sort
of surprised me. That may surprise you.

20
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:25,680
Hopefully a, and then I'd welcome having
actually just having a dialogue, um,

21
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:30,480
answering some questions about
what you want to know, um, or no,

22
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:34,780
uh, about this, uh,
remarkable individual. Um,

23
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:39,520
so let me start with just,
um, my first observation,

24
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:43,780
I was unaware of the extent of his genius.

25
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:48,550
This man got 300 patents. Uh,
he invented the electric motor.

26
00:01:48,551 --> 00:01:52,330
He invented long distance electricity
transmission according to the United

27
00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:55,840
States Supreme Court. He provided
us the, uh, the basics of radio.

28
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:00,310
He did remote control. He did
robots. I mean, the list goes on. Um,

29
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:05,020
according to the American Institute of
Electrical engineers were we to seize and

30
00:02:05,021 --> 00:02:09,340
eliminate from our industrial world.
The result of Mr Tesla's work,

31
00:02:09,341 --> 00:02:13,690
the wheels of industry would cease
to turn. Our towns would be dark.

32
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:16,720
And that's not all long after his death.

33
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:20,890
His visions inspired great minds.
I mean,

34
00:02:20,891 --> 00:02:25,300
he foresaw cell phones, radar laser
weapons, artificial intelligence,

35
00:02:25,301 --> 00:02:29,710
vertical lift airplanes, cell phones, for
instance. It's guys about 110 years ago,

36
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:34,320
he's talking about a device that
can provide news, um, and you know,

37
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:36,910
stock prices and all sorts of information.
And he said,

38
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:42,120
we shall see and hear one another as
perfectly as though we were face to face

39
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:46,750
despite innovating distances
of thousands of miles.

40
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:51,100
A man will be able to carry one
and his vest pocket 110 years ago.

41
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:55,770
He had invented, but he sort
of thought about it. Um,

42
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:59,830
and that envisioning is
I think quite amazing.

43
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:03,530
He does come across as
a bit of a magician. Um,

44
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:08,740
he would do presentations at various
universities and he would admit that

45
00:03:08,741 --> 00:03:13,741
electricity is this force that even
physicists will admit they don't fully

46
00:03:13,751 --> 00:03:16,810
understand what it is. Um, but we,

47
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:21,730
he was an others as well.
We're able to capture it and utilize it.

48
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:22,870
And in fact,

49
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:27,930
last century you asked engineers as to
what was the major accomplishment of the

50
00:03:28,091 --> 00:03:32,710
20th century. They ignored inner,
the internal combustion engine,

51
00:03:32,711 --> 00:03:34,780
the computer chip,
all these other sorts of things.

52
00:03:34,781 --> 00:03:38,950
They said the most amazing thing was
the ability to capture and transmit

53
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:43,480
electric power. And this man, this
magician, uh, was one of those.

54
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:48,400
He created lightning. This was something
that had been reserved only for nature,

55
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:53,500
but he's zapped it all over the place. Um,
you know, hundreds and hundreds of feet.

56
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:58,030
He also made lamps glow.
They were not attached to wires.

57
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:03,060
Um, so this man, um,

58
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:04,780
was in fact a magician.

59
00:04:04,781 --> 00:04:09,610
But you should also recognize that
he had some quixotic notions that,

60
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:13,030
um, complicated as legacy or, um,

61
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:16,380
made him more interesting depending
upon your perspective. Uh,

62
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:19,990
he spent a lot of time trying to figure
out how to communicate with intelligent

63
00:04:19,991 --> 00:04:21,550
beings on other planets.

64
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:25,060
He spent a lot of time trying to figure
out how to read your mind by putting

65
00:04:25,061 --> 00:04:28,720
little monitors on near your retina.
Um,

66
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:33,900
so he was both practical as far
as coming up with if you will,

67
00:04:34,631 --> 00:04:35,880
systems,
uh,

68
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:40,480
he was a visionary and thinking about
new things that he couldn't actually make

69
00:04:40,481 --> 00:04:42,620
cause the equipment or,
um,

70
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:47,620
technology just wasn't there and he was
also a little weird and off sometimes.

71
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:52,480
And I think it's that combination
that makes him so interesting.

72
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:57,280
The second surprise for me, uh, as was
noted, um, I'm an environmentalist.

73
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:01,180
I run the Midwest Office of
the Environmental Defense
Fund working on clean

74
00:05:01,181 --> 00:05:05,710
energy issues. And so for me to
find out that, uh, Nikola Tesla,

75
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:07,450
not only did he invent the electric motor,

76
00:05:07,451 --> 00:05:11,560
but he also was a clean energy pioneer.
That to me was pretty exciting.

77
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:17,000
Um, and he remains an inspiration
I think to a variety of, you know,

78
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:19,750
solar and battery manufacturers.

79
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:22,960
The Elon Musk who we mentioned before
has his car and his company named after

80
00:05:22,961 --> 00:05:23,051
him,

81
00:05:23,051 --> 00:05:28,051
but he contributed $1 million to
revitalize the Tesla laboratory up on long

82
00:05:31,271 --> 00:05:32,770
island.
Um,

83
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:36,850
I actually work in a shared office space.

84
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:41,940
It's a sort of a startup incubator and
there is right 10 feet behind my desk.

85
00:05:41,981 --> 00:05:46,981
There is a full sized cutout of Nikola
Tesla that at least I used to tell my

86
00:05:47,831 --> 00:05:51,880
wife, it was haunting me from behind
to go home and write more. Um,

87
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:56,920
but he has his leadership on clean
energy began actually in 1900.

88
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:01,550
Um, about 118 years ago. He
published an article in the century,

89
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:06,350
which then was the nation's largest
circulation periodical. It was entitled,

90
00:06:06,351 --> 00:06:11,210
the problem of increasing human energy
with special references to the harnessing

91
00:06:11,211 --> 00:06:15,560
of the sun's energy. Again, published
118 years ago was probably the earliest,

92
00:06:15,561 --> 00:06:20,561
most detailed look at how to capture
power from the sun and the wind for me as

93
00:06:22,371 --> 00:06:24,850
a, uh, an environmental advocate, um,

94
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:30,020
he inspires me to think of
if he was here today, what,

95
00:06:30,021 --> 00:06:32,960
how great it would be to focus
on the electricity industry,

96
00:06:32,961 --> 00:06:34,760
which he helped start.

97
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,900
But today largely because it
is monopolized. In other words,

98
00:06:38,901 --> 00:06:43,190
the electric utilities have total
control as many states over both the

99
00:06:43,191 --> 00:06:45,200
generation and the
delivery of electricity.

100
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:49,340
This industry has become innovation
averse has become risk adverse and it's

101
00:06:49,341 --> 00:06:52,850
become stodgy is become frayed.
The list goes on.

102
00:06:52,851 --> 00:06:54,410
If in fact Tesla was around,

103
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:58,760
he'd be off thinking about how am
I going to send power wirelessly,

104
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:02,540
how I'm going to make it without um,

105
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:06,980
having pollution. How am I going to
electrify other sectors of the economy,

106
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:10,670
particularly transportation.
How am I going to bring drudgery,

107
00:07:10,671 --> 00:07:14,240
saving electric power to everyone?
Around the world,

108
00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:15,770
perhaps for free,

109
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:21,010
including that we have 2 billion people
on this planet that do not have access

110
00:07:22,311 --> 00:07:25,870
to electricity at this
moment. He, in my mind, um,

111
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:29,990
if he were with us today would be
thinking outside of the box, um,

112
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:35,050
away from the sort of the monopoly think
that currently degrades that industry.

113
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:39,410
My third surprise,
um,

114
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:44,770
was his constant attempt and need to
balance the present and the future.

115
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:52,490
Uh, call it apocryphal, call
it weird color appropriate,

116
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:57,820
but he was born during a giant
lightening storm exactly at the stroke of

117
00:08:01,521 --> 00:08:06,050
midnight between the ninth
and 10th of July, 1856.

118
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:09,890
That's weird enough.
Just in the midst of a gale.

119
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:14,390
And this became part of Tesla Lore. You
know, his family sort of thought this was,

120
00:08:14,391 --> 00:08:17,210
you know, this is how
look a bit, um, you know,

121
00:08:17,211 --> 00:08:22,211
and he I think thought he was kind of
special because he had this trait that he

122
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:25,340
was born at this weird time
for me as a biographer,

123
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:30,710
I was able to get the
sense that in fact, um, it,

124
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:35,390
the birth story sort of
figuratively placed him in
the present as well as in the

125
00:08:35,391 --> 00:08:38,660
future.
It both today and tomorrow.

126
00:08:38,661 --> 00:08:43,661
And I think he spent his life trying to
struggle to find this balance between

127
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:48,140
focusing on current realities and
envisioning the future, the unknown.

128
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:50,780
And consider,
for example,

129
00:08:50,781 --> 00:08:55,781
the year 1,897 he had just figured out
how to transmit the enormous power from

130
00:08:58,081 --> 00:09:00,070
Niagara Falls,
um,

131
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:05,690
26 miles all the way to buffalo and then
a total of 400 miles down to New York

132
00:09:06,181 --> 00:09:10,980
City. This is huge because the
technology that on Thomas Edison,

133
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:15,540
who everybody looks towards of thinking
he was the electrical genius. He however,

134
00:09:15,541 --> 00:09:19,710
favored direct current, which could
basically move maybe half a mile,

135
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:20,940
maybe a mile if you're lucky.

136
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:25,620
Tesla was able to move
this power 400 miles,

137
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:31,970
the New York Times referred to this
diag or a project as the unrivaled

138
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:36,930
engineering triumph of the 19th century.
And who did the paper give credit to?

139
00:09:36,931 --> 00:09:41,931
They said to Tesla belongs the undisputed
honor of being the man whose work made

140
00:09:44,971 --> 00:09:47,400
this Niagara Project possible.

141
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:51,090
And of course there are statutes to or my
both sides, Canadian, the United States.

142
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:56,490
He did this amazing thing.
He was praised by the Times at parties,

143
00:09:56,491 --> 00:10:01,200
et cetera. And he was bored.
This was too much today.

144
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,550
He had done this,

145
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:07,740
he needed to look towards the future
to create a new area of science.

146
00:10:07,741 --> 00:10:12,741
And he called this tell him autonics
or what we might call a robotics.

147
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:18,410
His initial project was a radio
controlled model boat measured about,

148
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:24,700
Oh, I dunno, four feet in length
and maybe about three feet high. Um,

149
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:29,400
and he,
although he was rather shy scientist,

150
00:10:29,401 --> 00:10:33,480
he was capable of being a
showman if he had to. Um,

151
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:38,840
and so he had the debut of this Tele
Matan at the Madison Square Garden.

152
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:40,620
Huge arena.
This is the old one.

153
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:46,300
But this is where it happened during
the electrical exposition in May,

154
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:47,851
1898,
remember,

155
00:10:47,851 --> 00:10:52,851
this is about two months after the
battleship Maine had blown up in Havana

156
00:10:55,081 --> 00:10:57,990
harbor. We were in the midst of just the
beginning of the Spanish American war.

157
00:10:57,991 --> 00:11:01,290
So there was a lot of interest in
trying to figure out can we develop new

158
00:11:01,291 --> 00:11:05,760
weapons. And so here comes
tests. He has this model boat.

159
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:10,790
He builds a pond in the middle of the
exhibition hall and he invites possible

160
00:11:12,301 --> 00:11:16,470
investors, reporters, um,
other inventors and scientists.

161
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:20,100
And He tantalized them for,
you know, 15 or 20 minutes.

162
00:11:20,101 --> 00:11:24,480
He moved the boat backwards and
forwards around the pond. Uh,

163
00:11:24,481 --> 00:11:27,320
he made a dance almost like a water bug.
Um,

164
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:30,690
and so everybody was mesmerized by this.
You know, some people were thinking,

165
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:35,070
there's a tiny monkey in there. I'm
sure there's a tiny monkey in there. Uh,

166
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:39,630
but then after a while he then turns
to the audience and says, all right,

167
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:42,570
who wants to ask the a question?
Everybody's thinking.

168
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:46,590
You don't ask boats
questions, you know, some, um,

169
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:49,350
probably future Google person
came up and said, all right,

170
00:11:49,351 --> 00:11:52,950
what's the cube root of 64 and Tesla,
you know,

171
00:11:52,951 --> 00:11:56,940
where this hand hidden on
a lever underneath the,

172
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:02,000
the panel arranges to flick the
lights on the boat four times a.

173
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:04,210
And he said,
uh,

174
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:09,240
he created a sensation such as no other
invention of mine has ever produced.

175
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:14,650
His success of this was further
highlighted by Mark County's failure.

176
00:12:14,651 --> 00:12:19,480
Remember Marconi as the one who's given
public credit for wireless transmissions.

177
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:21,760
But of about three months later,

178
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:26,650
Mark County tried to do a very
similar project, built his own pond.

179
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:28,910
He built a,
um,

180
00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:34,930
a model frigate that he was to guide over
to what was referred to as the Spanish

181
00:12:34,931 --> 00:12:38,010
boat and it would have little bombs
on it would blow the, you know,

182
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:41,890
the tiny little Spanish boat
to smithereens. Unfortunately,

183
00:12:41,891 --> 00:12:46,780
Marconi had not mastered how does
send individualized messages.

184
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:50,050
So when his assistant punched the button,

185
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:53,410
the Spanish ship was just fine,

186
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:58,450
but there was a loud explosion to the
back room where mark had kept as miniature

187
00:12:58,451 --> 00:12:59,390
bombs.
Uh,

188
00:12:59,650 --> 00:13:03,040
because that's where the signal when he
hadn't figured out how to get it to the

189
00:13:03,041 --> 00:13:04,390
right spot.
Uh,

190
00:13:04,391 --> 00:13:09,310
and so there were loud blasts and smoke
that went throughout the exhibition hall.

191
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:14,650
Not surprisingly, Tesla was never
satisfied with just, you know,

192
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:17,180
a model boat and to the navy.

193
00:13:17,181 --> 00:13:21,010
He was not satisfied to suggest this was
a submarine that would carry bombs to

194
00:13:21,011 --> 00:13:23,190
blow up a frigate that was kind of boring.
You know,

195
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:26,200
they're thinking it's a Spanish
American war. This is great,

196
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:31,620
but he thinks this is a new
non biological form of life.

197
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:39,130
This is a machine that is
embodied with a borrowed mind.

198
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:41,920
His mind of course happens to be his,
um,

199
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:47,550
but he's seeing artificial intelligence
and it's predicting that this Tele Matan

200
00:13:49,210 --> 00:13:54,210
not only would quote follow a course
laid out or obey commands given form in

201
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,313
advance,

202
00:13:55,450 --> 00:13:59,800
but it will be be capable
of distinguishing between
what it ought and what it

203
00:13:59,801 --> 00:14:03,910
not ought to do. This again, over
a hundred, some odd years ago,

204
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:09,040
we were beginning to think in his
mind about artificial intelligence.

205
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:12,920
My fourth surprise actually.

206
00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:17,710
And so I was telling Richard Di resulted
from the discovery at the library of

207
00:14:17,711 --> 00:14:18,141
Congress,

208
00:14:18,141 --> 00:14:23,141
a boxes of letters that either Tesla had
written or had been written to him by

209
00:14:24,791 --> 00:14:28,540
friends or colleagues at central. For a
biographer, it's perspective. This is like

210
00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:35,130
Manna from heaven unit.
Suddenly you get to see this man's voice,

211
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:39,070
uh, in real time. What
those letters showed,

212
00:14:39,071 --> 00:14:43,450
I think was an overlooked side
to this remarkable genius.

213
00:14:43,451 --> 00:14:44,380
As I mentioned at the beginning,

214
00:14:44,381 --> 00:14:47,200
you've got the school of people
who think that he was a superman,

215
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:52,560
that one biographer called him a Supernova
in the galaxy of the human race and

216
00:14:53,241 --> 00:14:57,470
no doubt the combination of electric
motors, robots, remote control, you know,

217
00:14:57,471 --> 00:15:00,080
radio,
these are all super accomplishments.

218
00:15:00,081 --> 00:15:01,670
I'm not taking anything away from that,

219
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,170
but this scientist was also
human and charmingly. So,

220
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:10,310
and that was the fun part to sort
of get behind and tell that story.

221
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:13,580
His closest friends were the Johnsons.
Uh,

222
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:16,940
Robert who edited the Century magazine,
which I mentioned before,

223
00:15:16,941 --> 00:15:21,450
was the largest circulation
periodical. And his wife Catherine, um,

224
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:26,600
they operate in an intellectual salon
at their townhouse in Manhattan's Murray

225
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:29,480
Hill neighborhood.
They were not particularly rich,

226
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:34,010
but they sort of acted that way
and they gathered around them,

227
00:15:34,011 --> 00:15:36,320
this cadre of writers,

228
00:15:36,321 --> 00:15:39,620
artists and sculptors and would have
them over for all these great dinner

229
00:15:39,621 --> 00:15:40,460
conversations.

230
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:46,030
Mark Twain came to most of these and he
and Nikola Tesla became great friends.

231
00:15:47,751 --> 00:15:51,620
This is Mr Twain and Tesla. There
is in the, uh, in the background.

232
00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:56,570
So he would come to Tesla's laboratory
and the two of them would just play.

233
00:15:57,080 --> 00:16:01,100
They'd send electrical sparks across
the room. They hold up, you know,

234
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:04,310
Globes that were unconnected
to wires and make them

235
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:08,690
glow.
They would ex-ray each other's hands.

236
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:13,310
There were two kids having a
great time in their laboratory.

237
00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:18,080
They just happen to be the genius,
the engineering genius of the time,

238
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,390
and perhaps are the
best writer at our time.

239
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:25,280
One cute story about this is
that when they first met a Tesla,

240
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:28,880
a recalled that when he was 14 years old,

241
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:33,980
he had been quite sick and his parents
had given him some mark Twain's novels,

242
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:37,400
at least according to Tesla.
He told Mark Twain this,

243
00:16:37,401 --> 00:16:41,540
that you saved my life because
I got through this sickness.

244
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:45,740
And then Tesla said,
commented upon Twain. He said,

245
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:49,550
this great man of laughter
broke out into tears.

246
00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:53,990
I just thought that was so cute. Um, so
the two of them were, you know, a pair.

247
00:16:53,991 --> 00:16:58,991
But I think this relationship that Tesla
had with both Robert and Catherine,

248
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,320
um,

249
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:05,320
reveal sort of a jovial and relaxed
sign to this usually intense,

250
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:09,530
um, in venture. They
exchanged almost daily notes.

251
00:17:09,531 --> 00:17:12,590
They were talking about their health,
the writings of other scientists,

252
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:17,420
Tesla's latest inventions, um,
the state of the Johnson kids.

253
00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:20,810
Um,
just to give you one sense of one letter,

254
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:25,310
when Tesla had had a cold for
a little while, uh, Robert
wrote to him and he said,

255
00:17:25,490 --> 00:17:29,150
it's been a whole week since we saw you,
and you need cheering up,

256
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:31,610
coming as early as
possible and get cheered.

257
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:36,620
We're in a jolly mood and the fire is
light and on the heart and we only need

258
00:17:36,621 --> 00:17:37,454
you.

259
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:42,820
So here's this unbelievably intense
inventor who really love to spend most of

260
00:17:43,551 --> 00:17:46,280
his time by himself in his lab.

261
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:51,330
He was human charmingly so
would be my observation.

262
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:55,570
He never married.
He did fall in love once with a woman.

263
00:17:55,571 --> 00:17:59,730
Not that I never found out. Her last
name is Ana, a supposedly beautiful eyes.

264
00:17:59,731 --> 00:18:03,270
And the two of them, when he was 23 years
old, they would walk through, you know,

265
00:18:03,271 --> 00:18:04,800
Austrian parks and you know,

266
00:18:04,801 --> 00:18:08,500
plan how they were going to
have a big family and um,

267
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:12,810
he was going to go off to engineering
school. That did not happen.

268
00:18:12,811 --> 00:18:16,740
He went off to engineering school.
The relationship did not pursue,

269
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:22,010
but he later would admit that
inventors are not to be intimate.

270
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:25,770
That was sort of his conclusion. He
said, you know, you can be a musician,

271
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:28,470
you can be an artist,
you can be all these sorts of things,

272
00:18:28,471 --> 00:18:31,680
but if you're an inventor,
you're too intense.

273
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:34,920
And if you become married,

274
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:40,560
that will take away from the intensity
and focus that you need to have.

275
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:44,430
And there was one sad note near the
end of his life and he says, yeah,

276
00:18:44,431 --> 00:18:48,630
that may be true, but it
also makes those lonely. Um,

277
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:54,840
so this very human scientist,
um,

278
00:18:55,500 --> 00:19:00,500
I think also give us lessons about the
role and the example of being a discover.

279
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:07,400
And in inventor he reveled most
in the excitement of discovery.

280
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:11,600
Um, I just have a few pictures
of him going, you know,

281
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:14,190
sort of going through his life.
He would say,

282
00:19:14,191 --> 00:19:19,191
I do not think there is any thrill that
can go through the human heart like that

283
00:19:19,261 --> 00:19:24,261
felt by the inventor as he
see some creation of the
brain unfolding to success.

284
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:29,700
Such emotions make a man forget
food, sleep, friends love everything.

285
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:33,630
So where did this come from?
Where did this inventing spirit come from?

286
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:35,820
Some has to be just a Nate.
The guy was bright.

287
00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:38,520
I mean he could speak
eight languages fluently.

288
00:19:38,521 --> 00:19:42,720
He could recite lengthy poems
and stories just from memory.

289
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:48,230
He also had a father who was a Serbian
Orthodox priest who gave him mental

290
00:19:48,361 --> 00:19:53,040
exercises. He had to remember
sequences of numbers. He had to,

291
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:57,480
you know, recite longs, um, stories
and sort of the list goes on.

292
00:19:57,930 --> 00:20:02,550
Um, he also, um, was a little strange.

293
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:07,140
Um, this man who was born during
a midnight lightening storm,

294
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,000
uh,
when he was young,

295
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:14,030
used to have strobing light flashes in
his brain that led him to admit that

296
00:20:15,571 --> 00:20:20,250
sometimes he couldn't tell the difference
between reality and something that was

297
00:20:20,251 --> 00:20:25,230
fake. It also sort of led him to go off
on journeys, mental journeys, you know,

298
00:20:25,231 --> 00:20:30,231
so we had daytime and nighttime sort of
dreams where he would travel around the

299
00:20:30,541 --> 00:20:34,890
world to new lands, meet new people who
were almost, you know, real friends,

300
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:39,420
you know, to him. So where
did it come from? Exercise,

301
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:42,570
natural brilliance,
that a little bit of strangeness I think,

302
00:20:42,571 --> 00:20:47,200
but that's probably true of all of us.
Not that yours truly has a genius, but it,

303
00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:49,750
it is that combination.
He however,

304
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:55,140
had a particular type of invention
that I think is somewhat missing today.

305
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,430
Um,
and that's unfortunate.

306
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:02,760
His was a curiosity driven quest
for discovery or for reinvention.

307
00:21:03,461 --> 00:21:05,530
And it was motivated by idealism.

308
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:10,780
And this is in contrast to Thomas Edison
who basically invented because he was

309
00:21:10,781 --> 00:21:13,360
an entrepreneur and you want it to
make money and nothing wrong with that.

310
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:15,460
But Tesla,

311
00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:20,610
although he certainly enjoyed his fancy
dinners at the DELMONICO's and he had a

312
00:21:20,981 --> 00:21:22,960
nice apartment at the Waldorf Astoria,

313
00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:27,940
but he said the technology
transcended the marketplace.

314
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:33,190
That invention should not
just be tied to profits.

315
00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:38,550
He wrote the desire that guides me in
all I do is the desire to harness the

316
00:21:39,341 --> 00:21:42,370
forces of nature to
the service of mankind.

317
00:21:43,330 --> 00:21:46,180
So what does this teach
us? Um, if you will,

318
00:21:46,181 --> 00:21:50,500
about his inventing style that
we might utilize, uh, today.

319
00:21:51,150 --> 00:21:54,550
Um,
one observation,

320
00:21:55,440 --> 00:22:00,440
two one is that he firmly demonstrated
the link between a love of humanities and

321
00:22:03,011 --> 00:22:07,270
the love of science. Um, he loved poetry,

322
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:10,420
would recite it at length,
was deeply into, as I said,

323
00:22:10,421 --> 00:22:13,650
foreign languages and foreign
literature, et Cetera. Uh,

324
00:22:13,710 --> 00:22:14,650
and to give you an example,

325
00:22:14,651 --> 00:22:19,630
he envisioned his revolutionary
electric motor. The make,

326
00:22:19,631 --> 00:22:23,770
the thing that made the electricity
industry possible. He envisioned it.

327
00:22:23,771 --> 00:22:25,930
While walking through a Budapest Park,

328
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:31,380
quoting goodness Faust and then he picked
up a stick and drew a little design of

329
00:22:32,291 --> 00:22:34,630
it in the CNT.

330
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:39,430
It's this mix of humanities and science
that I think we are somewhat missing.

331
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:40,090
Uh,

332
00:22:40,090 --> 00:22:45,090
today we separate them more than I
guess Tesla would argue as necessary.

333
00:22:47,050 --> 00:22:50,980
The other observation and sort
of my final one is that, um,

334
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:54,210
he would observe, I think, um,

335
00:22:54,610 --> 00:22:59,610
that we have moved too far away from
the individualization of the inventor or

336
00:23:00,581 --> 00:23:03,460
the discover.
We now do things with teams,

337
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:07,360
and this is not a knock at all on teams,
but a lot of inventing,

338
00:23:07,361 --> 00:23:11,890
as you probably know, you have your own
teams here. Um, there are teams, you know,

339
00:23:11,891 --> 00:23:15,850
at universities, research centers, you
know, corporate laboratories, et Cetera,

340
00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:20,800
and they worked marvelously.
But what's missing,

341
00:23:20,970 --> 00:23:21,250
um,

342
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:26,050
he would argue is that sometimes you
just need the isolated individual who's

343
00:23:26,051 --> 00:23:30,550
free enough to go out there
and be stupid and I'm alone.

344
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:33,700
That's not to say it. See,
he needed to balance, again,

345
00:23:33,701 --> 00:23:38,050
this envisioning individualized
and venting with some reality.

346
00:23:38,051 --> 00:23:42,280
And he did that largely because he had
at least for a brief period of his life,

347
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:46,090
a lawyer who kept him in check
and he needed that. So I mean,

348
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:50,960
it's not like you just have
some individual Wacko out
there just thinking about

349
00:23:50,961 --> 00:23:53,360
the future.
You do need a team if you will,

350
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:58,540
but he would argue you don't need as big
of teams as we currently mostly focused

351
00:23:59,451 --> 00:24:02,570
on. I don't know if that's true. I'd
welcome your insights on that one.

352
00:24:02,571 --> 00:24:06,800
But that would be my guess of what
he would, um, come out. This he,

353
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:10,580
Mike, my final comment is that
I think he aimed high heat,

354
00:24:10,581 --> 00:24:14,830
perhaps higher than any other inventor.
Um,

355
00:24:14,930 --> 00:24:16,220
just a few more shots of him.

356
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:21,460
He worked tirelessly to bring electric
power freely to the world and he built

357
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:26,420
robots that he thought would
reduce life's drudgery.

358
00:24:26,930 --> 00:24:31,930
He was in short of driven by inner
forces that made sheer creation the most

359
00:24:33,441 --> 00:24:38,390
important thing in his life.
And we are the better for it.

360
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:40,520
Thank you very much.

361
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:45,290
I hope you enjoy rom reading
about this mastermind.

362
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:50,010
Um, and, um, I also hope that, uh,

363
00:24:50,090 --> 00:24:55,070
you help give him more of the due
recognition that at least I and your boss

364
00:24:55,730 --> 00:24:59,840
thinks that he deserves. So I'm
happy to take a few questions. Um,

365
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:03,290
there are books that are available
for all the people that are here,

366
00:25:03,291 --> 00:25:07,100
but let's unwelcome some questions and
some dialogue where you want to know or

367
00:25:07,101 --> 00:25:10,670
what do you know? I'll start
off with one. Oh, good.

368
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:15,950
How did he end up, what's the,
what's the end of the story? Um,

369
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:21,560
he ended up, uh, pouring
alone, um, and then, um,

370
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:25,900
lift his final days. I'm
sort of isolated, um,

371
00:25:26,030 --> 00:25:31,030
and the hotel New Yorker Morgan who refuse
to see anyone and would restrict the

372
00:25:32,481 --> 00:25:35,640
maids and others from actually spending
much time with them and just throws,

373
00:25:35,690 --> 00:25:38,330
shoving his grool, uh, to him.

374
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:41,890
And the only reason that he
even had enough money, um,

375
00:25:42,170 --> 00:25:46,790
at the end was because some sciences
out the Westinghouse Corporation,

376
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:51,350
which he essentially made possible
because he formed this partnership with

377
00:25:51,351 --> 00:25:54,320
George Westinghouse to do
the Niagara Falls project.

378
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:59,680
And so Westinghouse bought initially
his patents for his electric motor.

379
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:02,510
Um,

380
00:26:02,510 --> 00:26:07,340
but at the end it was a few scientists
at the Westinghouse Corporation that

381
00:26:07,341 --> 00:26:10,640
convinced the corporation that it was
an embarrassment to their company,

382
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:15,380
that he had just declared bankruptcy
and they needed to give him enough of a

383
00:26:15,381 --> 00:26:19,250
stipend so that at least he could survive.
Now that said he died,

384
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:21,710
I forget the room number
in the hotel New Yorker,

385
00:26:21,711 --> 00:26:26,010
but it was divisible by very good of a,

386
00:26:26,030 --> 00:26:31,030
and more than 2000 people then attended
his funeral service at the Cathedral of

387
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:34,400
Saint John The divine in New York
study by Columbia University.

388
00:26:37,490 --> 00:26:40,070
Thank you so much for coming today.

389
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:43,470
It's really nice to see someone speak
without a teleprompter here at Google.

390
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:49,230
Most people use it, but it's
nice when it's natural. Um,

391
00:26:49,290 --> 00:26:53,970
so my question is, you know, you, you
told this story about when he was born,

392
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:54,720
um,

393
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:59,720
how much do you think someone's success
is based on what they believe they can

394
00:27:00,541 --> 00:27:03,240
do throughout their life? Mm. Um,

395
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:08,190
versus their natural born,
you know, intelligence.

396
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:11,660
Well, this is a tough
one for Nicola. Um, yeah,

397
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:15,620
and this is probably a longer answer
than you wanted, but his life, um,

398
00:27:15,670 --> 00:27:18,640
his early life, I'm until he was
about seven years old, was blissful.

399
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:22,420
You two older sisters that doted on him,
lived on a farm, having a great time.

400
00:27:22,930 --> 00:27:24,070
But when he was seven years old,

401
00:27:24,071 --> 00:27:27,070
his older brother Dane who
was done I think 12 or 13,

402
00:27:27,071 --> 00:27:31,000
and he was Nicholas idle
and was the family favorite,

403
00:27:31,030 --> 00:27:33,280
was considered gifted beyond all means.

404
00:27:33,281 --> 00:27:37,720
And he would follow his father
into the priesthood. Unfortunately,

405
00:27:37,721 --> 00:27:42,380
the families, fam, um, white stallion, uh,

406
00:27:42,430 --> 00:27:47,260
Bolton and through his brother to the
ground and he died that night from his

407
00:27:47,261 --> 00:27:50,650
injuries and Nicola, their
witness. This, I mean,

408
00:27:50,651 --> 00:27:53,140
so this was a real
changing event in his life.

409
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:57,790
Where this comes back to your comment is
that you would think his parents would

410
00:27:57,791 --> 00:28:02,050
then say, oh, we've got our
remaining son. Let's focus on him.

411
00:28:02,051 --> 00:28:05,230
But no, his mom and dad are thinking, oh,

412
00:28:05,231 --> 00:28:09,700
if only Dane had lived, he would
have been great. Think of thing,

413
00:28:09,701 --> 00:28:11,590
amazing accomplishments
that he would have hand.

414
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:16,890
So Nicola claims that he grew up
without any sense of confidence because

415
00:28:17,291 --> 00:28:20,890
anything he did that was noteworthy,
his parents would think, oh,

416
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:25,120
Dane might've done it better.
So he,

417
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:30,300
he had this constant struggle
to find his father's affection.

418
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:35,860
Um, and it never came. Um, in fact, he,

419
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:38,440
this was far more than your question,
don't want wanted, but I mean,

420
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:43,060
he ended up finally getting his father
to allow him to go to engineering school

421
00:28:43,090 --> 00:28:46,450
and he did it for two years and
got stellar marks. But you know,

422
00:28:46,451 --> 00:28:48,310
whenever we got stellar marks,
his father was still,

423
00:28:48,311 --> 00:28:51,640
oh Dane could have been better.
And so he drops out of school,

424
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:56,020
Nikola Tesla drops out of school,
take some gambling and billiards, um,

425
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:59,410
move secretly to a town
like 200 miles away,

426
00:28:59,590 --> 00:29:04,030
gets arrested for vagrancy and is brought
back by the police to his parents.

427
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:06,250
You can imagine they're not exactly happy.

428
00:29:06,251 --> 00:29:10,230
And I'm not suggesting this as the model
for going to, you know, Google, you know,

429
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:15,070
tenure, but, and his father died not
long after that, just from the shock.

430
00:29:15,071 --> 00:29:17,140
So I don't know that,
I mean,

431
00:29:17,141 --> 00:29:21,040
he's not an example of someone who was
told all your life, you are the greatest.

432
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:24,130
He was told that he was not the greatest,

433
00:29:24,550 --> 00:29:26,650
and yet he persevered.

434
00:29:26,651 --> 00:29:31,060
And in part he persevered in response
to his father trying to get his father's

435
00:29:31,061 --> 00:29:32,860
attention. Um, you know,

436
00:29:32,861 --> 00:29:37,620
and he said that he went through
the strobing intense light, um,

437
00:29:37,690 --> 00:29:41,240
dreams that he had were in part
sort of a response to, you know,

438
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:45,430
this father figure. But no, he did
not grow up with confidence. Um,

439
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:46,930
it was actually quite the opposite.

440
00:29:47,790 --> 00:29:48,530
Tesla,

441
00:29:48,530 --> 00:29:52,250
and as we were discussing as a bit of
a cult figure in odd ways and actually

442
00:29:52,270 --> 00:29:55,560
turns up in popular culture, um, he's, uh,

443
00:29:56,670 --> 00:30:00,390
shows up in some movies and
some like a historical fashion.

444
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:05,420
What's your, what's
your take on that? How w

445
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:09,580
the thing that amazes me is
that as I wrote this book, um,

446
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:11,690
my publicist,
um,

447
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:18,160
posted a small excerpt of
it on a Nikola Tesla club.

448
00:30:18,970 --> 00:30:21,440
Um,
I think it was based in Chicago.

449
00:30:21,530 --> 00:30:26,530
And then suddenly the Nikola Tesla Club
in Toronto picked it up and then there

450
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:28,940
was a Nikola Tesla Club in Minneapolis.

451
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:33,130
There are hundreds of these
things and they're fervent, um,

452
00:30:33,230 --> 00:30:35,660
followers of the man.
I mean,

453
00:30:35,690 --> 00:30:39,550
so the dialogue that goes back
and forth on, um, you know,

454
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:41,570
whether what I wrote was halfway true,

455
00:30:41,571 --> 00:30:45,100
where there new theory of some conspiracy
there was associated with, you know,

456
00:30:45,170 --> 00:30:49,670
his final days and whether he in fact
did do a death beam and the CIA has,

457
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:53,630
you know, has um, you know,
squashed it. Um, I mean,

458
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:58,190
so yes, he has a cult following,
um, in the movie. I mean,

459
00:30:58,230 --> 00:31:02,300
the perfect person played him
in one, uh, movie. David Bowie.

460
00:31:03,350 --> 00:31:08,160
Is that not great? I mean, David
Bowie and Nikola Tesla, um, so, and,

461
00:31:08,161 --> 00:31:11,720
and yes, they were not exactly
accurate in their depictions.

462
00:31:11,721 --> 00:31:16,721
They had this one scene where Tesla's
one dream was that he was going to send

463
00:31:18,111 --> 00:31:22,730
electricity into the earth, the burst
of the lightening artificial lightening,

464
00:31:22,731 --> 00:31:23,271
if you will,

465
00:31:23,271 --> 00:31:27,230
into the earth and take advantage of
what he felt was the earth's natural

466
00:31:27,231 --> 00:31:28,370
electrical charge.

467
00:31:28,670 --> 00:31:32,990
And also take advantage of resonance
or an echo of force so that he can have

468
00:31:32,991 --> 00:31:36,260
this charge go throughout the planet
and people could basically, you know,

469
00:31:36,410 --> 00:31:41,330
plug something into the earth
and have free power essentially.

470
00:31:41,690 --> 00:31:45,290
Well, in this movie it's really
quite great. I mean, the, the,

471
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:49,850
the stars are out there.
They're screwing a light bulbs.

472
00:31:50,150 --> 00:31:54,710
I like hundreds of them across this
field. Um, that did not happen.

473
00:31:55,530 --> 00:32:00,110
Okay. But he has, he does
have indeed a cult following.

474
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:04,390
And I think, you know, I, I think
it's fair because I think it's impart,

475
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:09,480
um, he hasn't received
the recognition that, um,

476
00:32:09,770 --> 00:32:13,130
say Edison or Morricone have an,
this is not any knock on,

477
00:32:13,190 --> 00:32:17,450
on those great inventors,
but, um, you know,

478
00:32:17,451 --> 00:32:21,620
the New York Times in their obituary
basically said that it was Tesla who was

479
00:32:21,621 --> 00:32:26,000
the inventor of radio when I was Tesla
who brought us the electric motor and

480
00:32:26,001 --> 00:32:27,290
electricity transmission.

481
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:31,970
And I don't think most people recognize
that and give him his dues. So,

482
00:32:32,290 --> 00:32:32,900
um,

483
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:37,900
if that necessitates also having
kind of the weirdness involved.

484
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:43,390
Okay. What other questions? What else?

485
00:32:43,590 --> 00:32:44,423
Yeah,
please.

486
00:32:45,470 --> 00:32:49,670
Hi. So I was really curious
about you saying that he
died poor and he's like this

487
00:32:49,671 --> 00:32:53,450
great inventor and I wanted
to know what you owe. I mean,

488
00:32:53,451 --> 00:32:55,520
what did he feel about being rewarded,

489
00:32:55,940 --> 00:33:00,170
at least monetarily forward
this passion that he had. Um,

490
00:33:00,410 --> 00:33:03,230
and also you, yourself as
an item, writers in general,

491
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:07,070
also things such hard workers
and not being remunerated.

492
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:11,420
Oh, is that the truth? Um,

493
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:15,580
I'm not exactly answering your question,
but let me,

494
00:33:15,610 --> 00:33:17,890
let me try an angle and you
can tell me if I got there.

495
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:21,370
He actually could have been
amazingly wealthy. I mean,

496
00:33:21,371 --> 00:33:24,970
when he sold his electric motor
patterns to George Westinghouse,

497
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,860
he was living high on the hog.
As I said,

498
00:33:26,861 --> 00:33:30,820
he was eating his meals at Delmonico's
every night. Foyerman Yawn. You know,

499
00:33:30,821 --> 00:33:34,410
he lived in a large apartment
at the Waldorf historian,

500
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:38,320
probably the best hotel in New York
City. Oh, he got tons of money.

501
00:33:39,310 --> 00:33:41,750
But Westinghouse,
um,

502
00:33:42,310 --> 00:33:44,680
in large part because JP Morgan,

503
00:33:44,710 --> 00:33:49,480
the banker who was not exactly
a nice man, he wasn't, um,

504
00:33:49,570 --> 00:33:52,410
you know, tried to squeeze
out George Westinghouse, um,

505
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:55,150
not long after the Niagara
Project, which is, you know,

506
00:33:55,210 --> 00:33:57,220
they obviously spend a lot
of money to make this happen.

507
00:33:57,221 --> 00:34:01,100
And so there were a little cash short
and the economy is sort of just does it

508
00:34:01,101 --> 00:34:02,950
cycles.
And this was in one of the cycles.

509
00:34:02,951 --> 00:34:07,951
So Westinghouse was in not great shape
and JP Morgan basically tried to squeeze

510
00:34:09,341 --> 00:34:11,180
them out and said, you know, um,

511
00:34:11,350 --> 00:34:14,800
I'm gonna you either cut
expenses immensely or you know,

512
00:34:14,801 --> 00:34:19,000
you give your company that me and I'll
create the total electricity trust just

513
00:34:19,001 --> 00:34:21,070
like what he did with the steel industry.

514
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:26,740
So Westinghouse goes to a Tesla and says,
I'm in a real jam here.

515
00:34:27,270 --> 00:34:31,570
You know, I'm about to lose my
company and you have this royalty,

516
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:36,490
$2 and 50 cents per horsepower of motor.
I can't afford it.

517
00:34:38,590 --> 00:34:42,190
Tesla sitting there, he has all
the cards. He asked the patent,

518
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:46,000
he asked the contract and he's
not a really good businessman.

519
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:49,900
So he turns to George,
Westinghouse. And says,

520
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:54,460
Oh, you've been nice to me, will you?

521
00:34:54,490 --> 00:34:58,030
You're the one who will bring
my electric motor to the world.

522
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:00,790
I'm willing to tear up my contract.

523
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:06,220
He tore up $1 billion of money
that would have come his way,

524
00:35:06,221 --> 00:35:09,310
simply number one.
I don't think it was a great business man,

525
00:35:09,311 --> 00:35:13,060
and he certainly was a
horrible negotiator, but
because he was an idealist,

526
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:15,850
here was a man who was going
to bring his invention,

527
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:19,750
which he thought was the greatest thing
in the world and not going to argue with

528
00:35:19,751 --> 00:35:20,770
that.
Um,

529
00:35:21,070 --> 00:35:25,810
and for that he was willing to
sacrifice an amazing amount of wealth.

530
00:35:26,230 --> 00:35:28,990
Um, I'm not sure if that answered your
question, but I liked that story better.

531
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:34,900
What the lawyer had died
about a year before.

532
00:35:34,901 --> 00:35:38,280
I know this is what you need a
lawyer are so many times you don't,

533
00:35:38,281 --> 00:35:41,670
but this time you did.
What other questions?

534
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:42,910
Yeah.

535
00:35:42,910 --> 00:35:43,743
Yes,
please.

536
00:35:45,350 --> 00:35:49,140
Hi, thanks very much. And I just
wondering if you ran into, um,

537
00:35:49,250 --> 00:35:53,450
any associations of Tesla with, uh, the
Boston area at all during your research?

538
00:35:54,050 --> 00:35:57,110
Are there is a, um, there's
a Tesla AV in Medford.

539
00:35:57,111 --> 00:36:00,980
Overbuy Tufts and I've heard stories
that he used to live over there. So

540
00:36:01,650 --> 00:36:06,270
I don't know that he lived here. There is
a very interesting, um, MIT connection.

541
00:36:06,450 --> 00:36:09,380
Um,
I probably said Zach,

542
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:14,730
so in his later years, um, when he was on,

543
00:36:14,731 --> 00:36:18,000
to be honest, a little bit senile,
but also had flashes of genius,

544
00:36:18,001 --> 00:36:22,230
he would have birthday parties for himself
and he'd invite reporters and really

545
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:26,100
50 of the major reporters from the
New York Times, The New York Herald,

546
00:36:26,490 --> 00:36:27,270
Pi magazine,

547
00:36:27,270 --> 00:36:31,950
all these people would come and sit at
his feet for like five hours as the great

548
00:36:31,951 --> 00:36:36,951
man would ramble on 90% of the time
about jibberish and 10% of the time about

549
00:36:37,771 --> 00:36:40,540
something. Oh my God. You know. So, um,

550
00:36:40,590 --> 00:36:45,590
one of his visions during
these birthday parties was a,

551
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:49,290
um, uh, death beam,

552
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:54,920
something like star wars that could zap
battleships in airplanes out of the air.

553
00:36:56,030 --> 00:36:58,140
All right,
we're talking in the early 1940s.

554
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:03,270
I'm at a time when we're about to go
to war and the thought of Nikola Tesla

555
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:08,100
dying and he had the designs
possibly for a death beam,

556
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:09,060
um,

557
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:13,230
did not make the Federal
Bureau of Investigation all
that excited about allowing

558
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:16,110
his papers to go anywhere in the world.

559
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:21,140
So they hired an MIT physicist
and assembled all of his papers,

560
00:37:22,470 --> 00:37:27,330
you know, together, um, which were huge
boxes and he spent at least a week,

561
00:37:27,331 --> 00:37:28,540
if not a couple of weeks,
oh,

562
00:37:28,550 --> 00:37:33,510
I'm being overseen by Naval Intelligence
and federal FBI agents as he went

563
00:37:33,511 --> 00:37:34,291
through the documents.

564
00:37:34,291 --> 00:37:39,291
And there was one that he actually put
the top secret clearance on because it

565
00:37:40,411 --> 00:37:43,800
was in his mind close enough,
um,

566
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:46,990
to being practical,
um,

567
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:50,460
that it needed to be considered
to be top secret. The rest of it,

568
00:37:50,461 --> 00:37:55,461
he says basically the ramblings of an
old man and like say that the only old,

569
00:37:55,921 --> 00:37:59,460
but, um, but here's, here's
the critical question.

570
00:37:59,970 --> 00:38:03,900
Does anybody know who the MIT professor
was that they hired to do this?

571
00:38:06,330 --> 00:38:10,380
John Trump. John Trump was a member of
the National Academy of Engineering.

572
00:38:10,381 --> 00:38:15,300
He won the National Academy of Sciences
Award. He also happens to be the uncle,

573
00:38:15,301 --> 00:38:16,950
the 45th president of the United States.

574
00:38:17,710 --> 00:38:18,090
Okay.

575
00:38:18,090 --> 00:38:20,920
How's that?
And in fact,

576
00:38:20,921 --> 00:38:23,770
when the current president United
States was running for office,

577
00:38:23,771 --> 00:38:27,910
he would refer to his uncle
as somebody really bright.

578
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:31,150
Notice that I have a lot of smart genes.

579
00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:36,370
I'm really bright and it's because that's
my only sort Boston connection through

580
00:38:36,371 --> 00:38:40,660
MIT. Um, once through Mr.
Trump. What other questions?

581
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:52,220
So, uh, what brought them
from Australia to the u s um,

582
00:38:52,230 --> 00:38:55,640
he came, um, because um,

583
00:38:55,740 --> 00:39:00,210
he had been installing Edison
phone systems in Budapest,

584
00:39:00,211 --> 00:39:03,000
in Paris. Um, to be honest,

585
00:39:03,001 --> 00:39:06,150
he had been spending most of his time
thinking about electricity and in the

586
00:39:06,151 --> 00:39:09,510
Budapest park envisioned the,
the engine.

587
00:39:09,511 --> 00:39:14,000
But he had done such a great
job that his supervisors, um,

588
00:39:14,070 --> 00:39:19,020
sent him to New York to actually work
with Thomas Edison himself. And um,

589
00:39:19,110 --> 00:39:24,110
they sent him with probably the greatest
letter of recommendation that's ever

590
00:39:24,241 --> 00:39:27,780
been written. They said to Thomas
Edison, this letter to Thomas Edison,

591
00:39:28,050 --> 00:39:32,940
I know of two great men. You are one of
them. And this young man is the other.

592
00:39:33,870 --> 00:39:37,350
So
they worked together actually,

593
00:39:37,351 --> 00:39:41,220
but they were totally
different temperaments.

594
00:39:41,350 --> 00:39:46,320
Mean Edison was frumpy. He was
crass. I mean, he was a genius.

595
00:39:46,321 --> 00:39:50,670
I'm not, you know, this is no knock on
him. He just sort of was Tesla, you know,

596
00:39:50,671 --> 00:39:53,690
was this immaculate leader,
um,

597
00:39:54,530 --> 00:39:58,890
refined cosmopolitan that spoke eight
languages, new literature fluently,

598
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:03,930
um, you know, and looked like he dressed
like he was ready to go to the opera,

599
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:06,700
you know, during the day. Um, so
the two of them just, you know,

600
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:11,700
they were different sort of characters
and they've argued vehemently about how

601
00:40:11,701 --> 00:40:13,200
to transmit power.
I mean,

602
00:40:13,201 --> 00:40:16,200
Edison wanted to do it through direct
current because he thought it was number

603
00:40:16,201 --> 00:40:18,150
one. His, um,

604
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:23,020
and safer was his biggest argument
and Tesla was far more interested in,

605
00:40:23,021 --> 00:40:26,430
in trying to send it long distances so
that more people could take advantage of

606
00:40:26,431 --> 00:40:30,570
it. Um, and in fact, um, this
is more than your question was,

607
00:40:30,571 --> 00:40:35,480
but they split, um, because, um,

608
00:40:35,970 --> 00:40:40,380
Edison refuse to provide
the promised bonus.

609
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:41,220
Um,

610
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:46,220
if Tesla would increase the efficiency
of one of the dynamos regenerators and

611
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:51,660
Tesla had worked like three months, you
know, to triple the output of this thing.

612
00:40:51,690 --> 00:40:55,320
Then he goes to the wizard of Menlo Park,
who he still idolized at this time.

613
00:40:56,040 --> 00:41:00,840
And Edison basically just mocked
him and said, oh, come on.

614
00:41:01,170 --> 00:41:03,180
That was a joke. And then, you know,

615
00:41:03,181 --> 00:41:06,300
to this young immigrant who is still a
little sensitive or being in the United

616
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:09,690
States, he says, you're such an
immigrant. If you were only an American,

617
00:41:09,691 --> 00:41:13,800
you'd appreciate an American joke.
Edison, of course, to not laugh.

618
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:16,380
He pulled out his bowler
hat appropriately so,

619
00:41:16,590 --> 00:41:18,990
and walked out and quit his job
and started his own company.

620
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:22,590
So that's how we got to the United States.
All right. Thank you very much again.

621
00:41:22,860 --> 00:41:25,710
Thank you. I appreciate you guys having
me and I hope you enjoy the book.
