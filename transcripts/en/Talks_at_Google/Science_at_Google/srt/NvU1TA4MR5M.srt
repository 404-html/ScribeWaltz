1
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,460
So hydro, everyone, my
name is Pablo Rodriguez.

2
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:12,210
I am from south of his pain was
currently working on doing maybe to the

3
00:00:12,211 --> 00:00:16,770
Barcelona isn't the Institute of Marine
Sciences which is close to personae

4
00:00:16,771 --> 00:00:19,320
Davita. I don't know if
you have therapy there. Um,

5
00:00:19,321 --> 00:00:23,710
so my research topic for my phd
is mostly focusing bio chemistry.

6
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:28,440
So bio chemistry, science that involves
biology, geology and chemistry.

7
00:00:28,441 --> 00:00:29,070
So the change,

8
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:34,070
essentially what we do is to research
what the elements of the periodic table do

9
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:38,820
on the earth, right? How I trucking
moves in the ecosystem. How Carol,

10
00:00:38,821 --> 00:00:43,610
how sulfur nitrogen to right.
So I'm here at the,

11
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:46,770
to do in our research this day of a month,
I was last year too,

12
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:52,100
in order to use computer science to
understand the biological chemical cycles

13
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:58,950
that are in the ocean because that
what we do focusing the oceans, um,

14
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:01,110
what we studying is how the oceans,

15
00:01:01,111 --> 00:01:05,830
it speaks to the oceans is speak with the
atmosphere, right? So many of you know,

16
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:10,380
CO2, which is our gas, which has many
important effects on the atmosphere.

17
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,820
But there are also many gases that we
call trace gases because the concentration

18
00:01:14,821 --> 00:01:18,810
is so is too low that they
have important roles too.

19
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:22,890
So today's the world oceans day.

20
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:26,040
And the first thing I like
to ask you is why oceans?

21
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:30,720
Because actually if we think
the earth is a map, right?

22
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:36,420
Which the way in which they bought and
part it's not the land if the ocean,

23
00:01:36,421 --> 00:01:40,650
so how many oceans are here?
So essentially as one, right?

24
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:45,600
But mentally we can divide it in different
oceans and obviously every ocean has

25
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:50,130
different roles. So if we want to
understand how the ocean works,

26
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:52,110
the global oceans,
we call it,

27
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,560
we need to understand how it works
in the different parts of it, right?

28
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,460
So it's eventually, it's like a
puzzle that you have one piece.

29
00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:02,320
You know how a process
behaves in this part,

30
00:02:02,321 --> 00:02:06,000
how process behave in this part because
you put everything together and you have

31
00:02:06,001 --> 00:02:10,140
the whole thing.
So when I was had a child,

32
00:02:10,141 --> 00:02:12,570
I really love exploration.
I was born in Cartagena,

33
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,120
which is a city in the south of Spain.

34
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:18,120
And he's very famous because
it hustled of history.

35
00:02:18,121 --> 00:02:21,750
This is a Roman theater
was, yeah, Roman theater,

36
00:02:21,751 --> 00:02:26,700
one of the oldest one in the world.
Um, this is the boat is there.

37
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:28,980
If there's various research vessel,

38
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:33,240
which is the Polaris money special
and the base of the of the vessel is,

39
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:35,090
is in my home phone.
So since I was a teller,

40
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:39,360
really loves the exploration and
science and these kinds of things.

41
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:46,230
So this is the first picture of the, of
the earth. They came for Apollo Eight,

42
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:46,621
right?

43
00:02:46,621 --> 00:02:50,320
That's the first picture of the year
taking from the space for a human being.

44
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:55,290
So that's the moon surface and there
is the year there. So as we can see,

45
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:59,800
the earth is blue. So then blue marble,
I don't know if you have forever Lisa,

46
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:03,850
these different with this famous
phrase like near blue marble from you,

47
00:03:03,851 --> 00:03:08,710
from people like cars, Saigon. Um,
so, but until we can see clouds,

48
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:13,900
belts are important, right? So
we can see that these thing blue,

49
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:18,490
it has wide and also the continent,
which is Africa.

50
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:25,100
So let's here, if we assume it in the
picture, I mean we will have this,

51
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:28,980
this, this view of the
years, but this is not true.

52
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:33,960
I'm actually [inaudible] clouds are
missing away. Clouds are important.

53
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:38,190
Clouds are white. That's where y'all
views, right? Assaulting these flies,

54
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:41,070
Eh, it's helps you. For
example, if you are,

55
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:44,700
if you have to do a sport
in summer academies is you,

56
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:50,120
you have really high temperatures but
usually need to wear bright to life flows,

57
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:54,540
right? So 40 years is the
same, but the light art or,

58
00:03:54,541 --> 00:03:59,430
or the bright parts of the earth
help the earth to make in schooler,

59
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:04,570
right? Called him Sir. And what?

60
00:04:04,571 --> 00:04:09,420
He sees so many thoughts.
We has tally clouds when we are tutoring,

61
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:14,260
right? Schools, high school, I usually
teach her. Some professor told us, okay,

62
00:04:14,261 --> 00:04:15,460
so in order to have a cloud,

63
00:04:15,461 --> 00:04:20,461
you need the water to the sound light
will hit the water on the ocean or a lake,

64
00:04:20,741 --> 00:04:22,900
whatever.
The water will be evaporated.

65
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:27,590
We'll go through the atmosphere and
eventually we'll condense. I saw magic,

66
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:29,780
you will have a cloud,
right?

67
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:34,330
But the truth is that this
is not that simple, right?

68
00:04:34,331 --> 00:04:35,680
So you need articles,

69
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:39,520
we did the small particles that are
floating in the atmosphere in which the

70
00:04:39,521 --> 00:04:43,930
water that water molecules [inaudible].
Right?

71
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:48,670
So these articles can
be from the industry,

72
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:51,760
can be it cars for example of her,

73
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:56,570
I mean for all you've done last film,
even they can be viruses,

74
00:04:56,830 --> 00:05:00,700
they're flowing in the atmosphere
and the water can come dance.

75
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,470
So you have these particle,

76
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:06,700
the water condensing the particle and
after they be called many of them to

77
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,031
winter.

78
00:05:07,031 --> 00:05:12,031
So you have small cloud
droplets and eventually if
you have many small droplets,

79
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:17,890
you will have a cloud. So it's not that
simple, right? This is the western her,

80
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:21,010
um, this is Saharan dust, right?

81
00:05:21,011 --> 00:05:24,660
Which is really important for
these processes. So all this does,

82
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:29,730
it goes from the desert to the ocean
and up in the atmosphere helping these

83
00:05:29,731 --> 00:05:33,340
cloud formation processes.
Right? And also this dust, yes,

84
00:05:33,341 --> 00:05:38,341
for eternal can go from here to
the Amazon rain forest 30 license.

85
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:44,050
Right? So this is sort of
so important. I usually,

86
00:05:44,051 --> 00:05:47,500
so that's why you okay ms three
B now we're not the atmosphere,

87
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:51,940
the ocean Dalon on everything is
connected some way somehow. Right?

88
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:58,310
But these higher fires that also
contributes to them to them.

89
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:04,080
I Aerosol particle budget in the
atmosphere industry as I said before.

90
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:10,830
So they got them the amount of energy
that the earth can reflect right from the

91
00:06:11,991 --> 00:06:15,440
song.
We call it the Albedo effect.

92
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:19,660
So the higher the number in the border,
right?

93
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:24,130
The better for us because the
temperature will be lower, right?

94
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,633
This is a victory.

95
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:30,440
We take out all the clouds if
we take him out, all of them.

96
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:34,170
So we will have the
Albedo from the desert,

97
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:38,820
which are quite right too
for the polar regions. Um,

98
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:41,900
the ocean on the elevator from the ocean,

99
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:45,050
which is something we can say
that this narrative, right?

100
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:46,640
Because it's really dark.

101
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:52,840
So we have an Albedo effect factor of
zero point 15 but if we include clouds is

102
00:06:54,231 --> 00:06:58,520
a dabble of it.
So essentially belts are really important.

103
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:03,830
So I told you that the dust on
the particles in the industry,

104
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:06,650
they go to the asthma sphere.
Also from the deserts,

105
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:10,770
but even leading beings like blondes,
they can release their articles, right?

106
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:15,250
Or gas is that when they are oxidizing
the atmosphere with the react,

107
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:18,350
we're reacting. We felt were
compounds come from particles,

108
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,690
also CIS also sea salt.

109
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:25,520
So eventually you put all of this and
this, and this is simulation obviously,

110
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:27,740
but you can see that
the in the atmosphere,

111
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:30,380
the way this article
Travis or of the worries,

112
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:34,910
very amazing right away we started out.
So most of,

113
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:38,110
most of us we know about climate change.
That's another, it's, it's a dumb thing.

114
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:39,770
It doesn't matter.

115
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:45,680
So all we all know that temperature will
increase by the end of the 21st century.

116
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:49,780
But the dependence on the way we
will meet if we are made to more,

117
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:52,550
more signature les Sia too.

118
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:57,800
If we change land uses are not
in many things but, but anyway,

119
00:07:57,830 --> 00:08:00,850
even if we reduce everything,
even if we are stalled,

120
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,360
temperature is going to increase.
Right?

121
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,980
But the problem is that how
much that's the key west.

122
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:11,800
So we have different scenarios and
the Democrats are down in the old,

123
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:15,890
more optimistic.
In the most optimistic scenario,

124
00:08:15,891 --> 00:08:20,000
temperature can increase made end of
the century zero point suite and in the

125
00:08:20,001 --> 00:08:24,390
worst lung up to five.
Right. And why is that? Well,

126
00:08:24,391 --> 00:08:28,040
Ferris because of the of the eight
scenarios, right. But second,

127
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:33,110
because there are many processes that
we don't know, we don't know well yet,

128
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:35,720
right?
If you see the error of ours.

129
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:40,160
So essentially the aerosol
particles I was telling you,

130
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:44,350
or club interaction,
I also radiation,

131
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:49,980
they come through with the highest
error taught anthropogenic forcing on

132
00:08:52,401 --> 00:08:54,080
climate.
Right?

133
00:08:57,650 --> 00:09:02,270
So what, what I eat, what to
work with my, with my phd's,

134
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:05,570
we should call April theses.
So the Cli, both SEZ solving,

135
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:11,210
it's not a policy is he's not this, not
solving that real [inaudible] are fucked.

136
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:16,270
And you will see that they all
the, the the, some, sorry, kids.

137
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:21,080
The, the, the surface of the ocean.
The ocean worlds, right. You see,

138
00:09:21,081 --> 00:09:22,400
as the ocean warms,

139
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:26,450
their feet upon zone will grow because
leaving beans are happy when the

140
00:09:26,451 --> 00:09:29,770
temperature east side, right?
Nope. Health much higher. Uh,

141
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:33,850
they were quite happy when they're,
when they're quite hubby,

142
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:37,190
they began to release
some of these trace gases,

143
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:41,990
almost these compounds like
vms, the mythical suicide,
right? These trace gases,

144
00:09:41,991 --> 00:09:45,560
they go to the other moss
here, right? And they,

145
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:47,530
they react with soul for,

146
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:50,960
and they increased the concentration
of song compounds that eventually will

147
00:09:50,961 --> 00:09:53,060
become particles,
right?

148
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:55,990
We help to create clouds.

149
00:09:56,570 --> 00:10:01,570
So essentially it's like the microorganism
are able to react to the warm up the

150
00:10:01,971 --> 00:10:06,470
waters on create like an umbrella for
them, right? This is not something,

151
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:11,420
I mean, let's say true because obviously
Mike Organism, they kind of think, right?

152
00:10:11,421 --> 00:10:15,540
They don't do that in purpose. But
essentially this is a reaction we task.

153
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:19,820
We can go here in many places and
Angelie like everything is science.

154
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:24,380
Things are Moscow employee things are
much more complex than that, right?

155
00:10:24,381 --> 00:10:27,720
So we have these trace gases.
We tire since elite Guy,

156
00:10:27,721 --> 00:10:30,170
she is produced by the
biological ecosystem.

157
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:33,590
We targeted organism leaving
in the surface. Right?

158
00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:38,300
But also we have other kind of
aerosols like when the, when the waves,

159
00:10:38,301 --> 00:10:42,740
for example, date when they break, right?

160
00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:46,310
They released some Cecil articles
that go to the atmosphere too.

161
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:49,700
So it's such a complex thing,
right? And this is the thing,

162
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:54,280
at least contributing more to the
Eh, to the answer. Dainty leveling,

163
00:10:54,290 --> 00:10:57,400
climate change projections
for this century.

164
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:00,090
So this is on a Ieg,

165
00:11:00,091 --> 00:11:03,620
all of representation of the south
and ocean and the Arctic Ocean, right?

166
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:08,000
So you can see there being ways you're
going to see seals can see the famous

167
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:10,610
creel over there, right?
You see the career.

168
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:14,510
So what I do for a Btb,
these partner,

169
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:20,180
obviously the sizes are not the real,
right? So this is like a micro organism.

170
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:24,650
This organism can be one
millimeter, right? So this is not,

171
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:28,480
it's not real that you can see there.
These are postop,

172
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:31,250
this purple stuff going from
the ocean into the atmosphere.

173
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:34,190
These are trace gases
that where we started the,

174
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:38,810
eventually they become articles and they
will help in clubs, formation processes,

175
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:44,110
but also,
but also they are like eh,

176
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:46,490
signals for some animals like seagulls.

177
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:51,410
So when a seagull is flying right,
they don't see what he's below the water.

178
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:54,300
Obviously there,
if there is something like an oil lacy,

179
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:58,180
but if they want to break Krill, they
usually see the critical and their flight,

180
00:11:58,330 --> 00:12:01,360
but they kind of Smelly,
right? So these trays,

181
00:12:01,361 --> 00:12:05,410
Garcia or Natalia important because
they held in the cloud formation versus,

182
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:09,010
but also they're important
chemical signals for animals.

183
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:14,270
If we think in the ocean, we all
have seen documentaries, right?

184
00:12:14,271 --> 00:12:19,271
And we usually tend to think that the
ocean is something we taste and full Wales

185
00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:23,190
Delphine's, um, being this dumpy,
but actually the old Chinese,

186
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,390
it's mostly empty. All of
these big animals, right?

187
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:30,690
The mostly for my bacteria by microbes.

188
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:35,040
So they all kind of St Helia
microbial soup. Um, the visit,

189
00:12:35,041 --> 00:12:39,870
the number over kills bacteria and the
ocean, which is one all by 13 zero s

190
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:41,740
yeah.

191
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:45,750
Um, I was telling you about the gassy.
So these are the trace gas has to,

192
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:49,780
for my phd, which is called ISO bring.
And he says [inaudible] trace gas,

193
00:12:49,781 --> 00:12:54,781
which is produced inside every cell
on the earth doing photosynthesis.

194
00:12:55,090 --> 00:12:58,270
Every sale on the earth.
The task plastics. Right,

195
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:01,960
which are the Oregon's where
we're focusing is produced. Right.

196
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:07,300
But these mostly produced by,
by land and by lung plans,

197
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:12,370
router down Fido Bunco we teach that we
charged a microbial organism leaving in

198
00:13:12,371 --> 00:13:15,670
the ocean that are able to
do for the census is right.

199
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:18,100
You may think why is important.

200
00:13:18,101 --> 00:13:22,580
Well it goes to the lifetime in the
atmosphere of these trace gases.

201
00:13:22,581 --> 00:13:25,370
So east really low, really low. Um,

202
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:29,830
so they have lost enough time to travel
from one continent to another word like

203
00:13:29,831 --> 00:13:31,570
this, a higher on dust, right?

204
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:35,140
So lifetime lifetime
from two to three hours.

205
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:37,000
So when I saw is releasing the ocean,

206
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:41,830
it reacts immediately in this area
or in a really close area, right?

207
00:13:41,831 --> 00:13:45,250
So the clouds that are formed there,
they came from these,

208
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:47,170
they are produced by these trace gases.

209
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:50,590
That's the importance of Elvis studying
these trace gases in the ocean.

210
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:55,230
And also because the
ones that are in meat in,

211
00:13:55,290 --> 00:14:00,250
in England, they are interacting
with some anthropogenic.

212
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:04,990
Yes, he's on par. Two goals
for an industry. Um, these
are these kind of things.

213
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:09,810
So these are some of the organisms
living in the, in the surface ocean,

214
00:14:09,811 --> 00:14:13,480
and they do the photosynthesis
on day release. These compounds,

215
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:18,040
the the dope, right of the big, you can
see progress locos broker, Coco's Isa,

216
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:22,290
back to your plant them,
which is how bacteria is able
to perform photosynthesis,

217
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:26,950
right on these organisms. It was
discovered by the MIT in the early India,

218
00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:30,670
late eighties in early
19 so when I was born,

219
00:14:31,090 --> 00:14:35,290
this organism didn't even exist. He just
seeks whether we didn't know, right?

220
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:40,660
So this is the most abundant organisms
on earth and this is the most abundant

221
00:14:40,661 --> 00:14:42,760
organisms able to do the photosynthesis.

222
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:47,530
And actually I've already into some
estimates from the 20% or from the,

223
00:14:48,210 --> 00:14:51,800
you can say 15% 25% of the seeking.

224
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:53,390
We are briefing here.

225
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:58,790
It has been produced by disorganizing
and 28 years ago, 27 years say, well,

226
00:14:58,810 --> 00:15:01,070
we didn't even know that
these organismic seasons.

227
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:06,310
So the ocean is salt in that there are,

228
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:11,260
we have many things to this
core steel. Well, what I do,

229
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:13,750
so I use my deposit down models,
physical models.

230
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:17,230
This is a model for an
ETA for my collaborators.

231
00:15:17,231 --> 00:15:19,270
And here you can see the ocean currents,

232
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:22,330
how they change during
the on every season.

233
00:15:22,810 --> 00:15:27,130
Did you kind of see that some
parts are dark, dark, sorry,

234
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:30,580
which means that the speed is pretty high,
right?

235
00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:33,730
So you can see that the itself and often
it's in the south and ocean, right?

236
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:39,390
I mean it's not something like like
a Tom see something really cold.

237
00:15:39,521 --> 00:15:43,630
This is like the tasks like
rivers flowing inside, right?

238
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:46,820
So this is the biology.

239
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:50,690
So this is the way these micro
organism called phytoplankton,

240
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:54,110
they're able to do photosynthesis
change through the year.

241
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:57,590
You can see it's brain
arrives and they blew,

242
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:00,140
they booming build.

243
00:16:00,530 --> 00:16:04,880
So the mission of these trace
gases in the seasons is higher

244
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:10,600
of what else? So we have, we have these
smaller, which is like a physical model,

245
00:16:10,601 --> 00:16:11,140
right?

246
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:16,000
But we also need to know how
the marine ecosystem works,

247
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:19,470
right?
So we have the w that's like alarm.

248
00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:22,870
So you have the primary production
errors you have to consumers.

249
00:16:22,871 --> 00:16:25,720
You have the predates hours, right? So,

250
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:29,230
so do you have nutrient you need to know,

251
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:33,160
which is the amount of nutrients they
have in we in the south and ocean for

252
00:16:33,161 --> 00:16:36,970
example.
How many species are producers?

253
00:16:36,971 --> 00:16:40,480
You want Tom in his pieces
are per day tours. You will.

254
00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:45,020
So this is the here, it looks really
simple that eventually this is a,

255
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:48,220
this is a really big branch of
regulations including one mall.

256
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:53,630
What we do here,
what I'm doing here for my phd is yes,

257
00:16:53,631 --> 00:16:54,740
putting off this to wherever.

258
00:16:54,741 --> 00:16:58,520
So we have the physical framework with
the car runs and production or whatever.

259
00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:02,450
So we have like assist
cause he's taking a diagram.

260
00:17:02,451 --> 00:17:04,640
Let's say we know how the ecosystem,

261
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:08,900
how the microbial ecosystem
works in the south and ocean.

262
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:14,200
And we also know which amount of these
trace gases are MEP by every cell.

263
00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:19,880
And eventually we put all of these Twitter
so we can estimate for a couple day

264
00:17:19,881 --> 00:17:22,580
meeting a Pfizer bring in
the whole south and ocean,

265
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,033
right?

266
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:30,880
Well this is the Muslim part. This is
the, let's say the mathematical part,

267
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:34,110
but we need data and if we need data,

268
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:38,290
we need to travel really far and we
need to do all Shannon, graphic cruises,

269
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:41,770
oceanographic institutions.
So these are the views from my,

270
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:46,830
from my Kevin I to be living inside
here like two months discouraged in the

271
00:17:47,711 --> 00:17:52,711
English Channel when we were sailing
for a long course or in Germany to South

272
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:56,720
Africa. So the first career
that at the first cruise,

273
00:17:56,721 --> 00:18:00,690
how you participate in order to measure
these compounds and see how the,

274
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:05,340
how they are releasing the ocean was
these ones are as big as 20 2014.

275
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:09,330
We are starting to spin and
we arrive to South America,

276
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:14,180
these salient the Atlantic Ocean Marcy,

277
00:18:14,290 --> 00:18:17,520
if ways you have to be there like working,

278
00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:21,570
everyone gets the sea to everyone gets DC.

279
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:25,530
I mean some people say you know,
I know everyone at some point gets dizzy

280
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:32,280
but what if you want to go to the
south and altering? So this is south,

281
00:18:32,281 --> 00:18:35,830
I'm very candid and Arctic peninsula,
you can see this,

282
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,670
this here, that's there. We'll see. Um,

283
00:18:39,730 --> 00:18:43,660
so if you want to reach this
self an ocean, you need to
cross the Drake passage,

284
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:48,580
right? The Drake passage is the most
dangerous place in the world for sale.

285
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:50,880
I don't know if you like salient,

286
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:54,670
but if you see this bold races that
every year when they have to grow through

287
00:18:54,671 --> 00:18:58,780
there is a total mess for us.
It's easier because our bolts are bigger.

288
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:01,870
They are not, they are investors.
There are not both there,

289
00:19:01,871 --> 00:19:04,450
they are not sailing boats at all.
So it's very easy.

290
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:09,980
Now the point is that you have a
belt of storms coming every field,

291
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:12,130
every three days,

292
00:19:12,131 --> 00:19:16,080
and the time that the storms is
there is three days to under time.

293
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:21,140
Do you have to spend in order to go from
South America to Antartica three days

294
00:19:21,911 --> 00:19:22,744
to an hour rate.

295
00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:27,730
So the point is that you have to be
there waiting and there was term going.

296
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:32,620
That's the moment you start with the boat
trying to reach Antarctica before and

297
00:19:32,621 --> 00:19:37,030
he has term we'd arrive, right?
It's a very difficult place to be.

298
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:42,100
So we performed these screens,
which is called Picasso. Um,

299
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:46,130
we went to these areas, health and
all. So that's South America. Um,

300
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:49,000
that they need to laugh.
We have a been wing,

301
00:19:49,001 --> 00:19:53,950
which was really happy with us
and he jumped into the Cilia. Um,

302
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:59,220
so we went with this research vessel
here you have the proof that this is

303
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:01,593
sure

304
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:07,040
there look at a deficit for real.

305
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:10,270
I don't know.
So they're usually,

306
00:20:10,271 --> 00:20:15,271
depending on the place you
go on Antarctica and usually
animals are not really

307
00:20:15,281 --> 00:20:18,490
used to human means, right?
So they don't respect you.

308
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,600
So even a being we teach like
it's like a feature of their,

309
00:20:22,610 --> 00:20:25,850
it's like a seagull is like
one of the ease of the,

310
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:30,700
he's an animal that is prey by
most of the rest of the others.

311
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:34,120
They don't even care about
you jump there on their board,

312
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:35,873
they jump up.

313
00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:43,020
This is how it looks when you are crossing
the Drake passage from South America

314
00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:44,920
too on [inaudible] gun.

315
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:50,570
These are the people we were there working
to better sell how we weren't there.

316
00:20:50,921 --> 00:20:53,530
So we sample it many different ways.

317
00:20:53,531 --> 00:20:58,140
So this one is for something they micro
layers and the micro surface layer of

318
00:20:58,141 --> 00:20:58,974
the ocean.

319
00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:04,110
So essentially we introduce one plate
of glass and then must surface layer of

320
00:21:06,071 --> 00:21:10,390
the ocean get stuck on it. And
after we cleaned like this, uh, we,

321
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:14,680
we,
we get these syrups in this order.

322
00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:18,790
In order to feel this bottle,
we need to spend like one hour there.

323
00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:20,920
So this is [inaudible],
right?

324
00:21:20,921 --> 00:21:25,921
So we have small boats inside the big
bolt that we use sampling over there said

325
00:21:27,061 --> 00:21:30,790
you're going to see in the
background, uh, an ice layer.

326
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:37,030
We also use these, these sermon,
which is called Rosette CTD. Russell.

327
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:41,500
This is the most iconic
instrumenting ocean sciences, right?

328
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,870
So you can see there, it looks like, um,

329
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:48,370
well essentially you have all
of these are bottles, right?

330
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,930
And every bottle has an amber.

331
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:54,580
So Judy ploy this instrument and you
deploy it until the border for the seat or

332
00:21:54,581 --> 00:21:59,070
until the, that you want, right? When
it's going down, it's measuring, right?

333
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:03,920
But it's going now, especially Sanford,
her measures for inventory to her.

334
00:22:03,930 --> 00:22:08,440
So let me did measure that so you
can see how it looks, the ocean,

335
00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:09,010
how it will,

336
00:22:09,010 --> 00:22:13,980
how is the vertical profiles or of
their main properties of the ocean,

337
00:22:14,050 --> 00:22:18,730
let's say.
And when you recover it and he's going,

338
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:23,090
you can tell from the boat
to every bottle. So open up,

339
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:26,700
open up distance,
you can tell the bottom number six.

340
00:22:26,701 --> 00:22:29,950
So you will be open to their port,
400 meters.

341
00:22:30,670 --> 00:22:34,270
So under the bottle number,
five to 100 meters, whatever.

342
00:22:34,570 --> 00:22:38,980
When you got it back on the boat and
you put it here that you have different

343
00:22:38,981 --> 00:22:42,250
models and every Volvo has the water,
a different debt.

344
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:47,880
She says mark way of sampling rather
than going with a submarine or are these

345
00:22:48,941 --> 00:22:51,130
kind of things we start
which are really expensive.

346
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:55,280
So that's the way we usually pick the
water from the depot. We don't go,

347
00:22:55,281 --> 00:22:57,670
it's so marines or,
or we don't dive there.

348
00:22:57,671 --> 00:23:01,960
So we use these kind of instrument
which has been used in during the last

349
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:04,870
decades.
We also perform experiments or more.

350
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:07,270
So these containers,
they're,

351
00:23:07,271 --> 00:23:11,560
they have water pumping
from the and directly. Um,

352
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:16,270
so in order to keep the same temperature
in the ocean done in these boxes let's

353
00:23:16,271 --> 00:23:19,270
say,
and there we have small borders,

354
00:23:19,271 --> 00:23:23,680
we've committed different fighter on
communities there we see how they react

355
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:27,490
with the, with, with the
light or in our conditions.

356
00:23:27,630 --> 00:23:31,750
This that with all day?
Both as is you on a test.

357
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:36,880
We also big eyes. That's
me. Begin some eyes.

358
00:23:37,170 --> 00:23:39,250
And why we big eyes with an axe.

359
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:44,920
Because I mean you can see here in this
picture, this is not fear the ice, right?

360
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:47,720
So you could go see inside the eyes.
They're leaving beans too.

361
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:52,340
So you start the ice. We
have phytoplankton too and
they live there, right?

362
00:23:52,370 --> 00:23:54,860
So on this such an important
thing because actually

363
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:00,140
Kareel usually eat these federal bundle.

364
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:02,970
They go below the ice and this carotid.

365
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:08,540
So these are, it's almost the organism
done the we found inside the eyes.

366
00:24:08,810 --> 00:24:10,940
So to make sure at least
full of leaving means,

367
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:12,430
okay,

368
00:24:12,430 --> 00:24:16,740
do we participate also in the ace Murray
Team University, which was a universe,

369
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:17,730
a cruise.

370
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:22,860
What started him Bremerhaven
Germany onto the South Africa.

371
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:27,120
That was a cruise that we
were scientists working there,

372
00:24:27,121 --> 00:24:29,700
but also 50th students
from all over the world.

373
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:33,990
We sold many things like flying few,
she's,

374
00:24:33,991 --> 00:24:35,520
I don't know if you have ever seen them.

375
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:39,090
And we were on the academics
first Nichols research vessel.

376
00:24:39,370 --> 00:24:43,800
And this project was funded by the Swiss
polar incidents, which is around by you,

377
00:24:43,810 --> 00:24:46,870
this fiscal Roman Ada, t VFL, um,

378
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:49,110
older institutions for [inaudible].

379
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:55,090
So this is how our lab look like,
right?

380
00:24:55,091 --> 00:24:57,220
We were setting up the lobby,
not moment.

381
00:24:58,420 --> 00:25:02,860
You can see there the [inaudible] the,
and I told you it's quite claustrophobic.

382
00:25:02,861 --> 00:25:04,510
Everything, right? So,

383
00:25:05,090 --> 00:25:05,923
okay.

384
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:08,870
Pretty smile. Pretty small, no windows

385
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:14,010
he sees around him. The
Baltimore Sun, the cables,

386
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:19,350
all used to be the finest thing is you are
on a basal, so everything moves, right?

387
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:24,030
So do you have to tie everything to
the walls? Even the chairs are there.

388
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:27,900
They're tied to the floor, right?
So everything kind of be, I mean,

389
00:25:27,930 --> 00:25:32,370
everything has to be really stable because
if you have a festo literally chairs

390
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:35,200
for example,
they come eat will love them.

391
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:37,770
The MV flying over the rooms.

392
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:39,450
Okay.

393
00:25:39,450 --> 00:25:44,180
So on last year we participate the,
well, two years ago must be right.

394
00:25:44,450 --> 00:25:48,130
That's you're actually [inaudible]
Felicia as well. So cruises,

395
00:25:48,131 --> 00:25:51,740
starting from Africa. Um, but, uh,

396
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:55,600
after we went to Hobart in Australia,
[inaudible],

397
00:25:55,730 --> 00:25:57,580
rns in South America and Africa again,

398
00:25:57,581 --> 00:26:01,960
so it was that whole street navigation
of Antarctica. What's was the first time,

399
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:07,140
uh, an international expedition has
done it all history by Internet.

400
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:12,670
We found scientific age, right?
Um, so Liesel fly a squeeze.

401
00:26:12,730 --> 00:26:13,401
I don't know if you,

402
00:26:13,401 --> 00:26:16,910
if you knew that we'd have flying fishes
on the ocean was also playing a squids.

403
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,290
I have to recognize that I
have even know eat until,

404
00:26:20,770 --> 00:26:24,400
until that moment that they exist.
Um,

405
00:26:24,401 --> 00:26:27,580
so we sold many keeping
[inaudible] Kim being green,

406
00:26:27,581 --> 00:26:31,810
which is the second biggest one
after the ember of being me. Um, yes.

407
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:34,600
[inaudible] he's coming in.
We are interested.

408
00:26:35,950 --> 00:26:39,750
So the expedition was divided
in three different legs,

409
00:26:39,751 --> 00:26:43,770
on every leg was more or less one month,
right on a park.

410
00:26:43,771 --> 00:26:44,820
You see facing the first one.

411
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:46,540
Okay.

412
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:47,780
I said,
these are some pictures.

413
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:51,740
This is camping with this is

414
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:59,380
many of them do better having
baby big means on everything.

415
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:02,550
So they,
I saw Davis Hill,

416
00:27:02,570 --> 00:27:07,480
how one of them was killed
by these school us. Um, um,

417
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:10,370
or over seagulls,
partner's health and ocean.

418
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:14,550
So this is [inaudible] speaking.

419
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:17,420
It's like real like otherwise.

420
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,073
Okay.

421
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:23,310
Um,
this one will be able through some of the,

422
00:27:24,450 --> 00:27:26,820
when we were starting from Cape Town

423
00:27:30,990 --> 00:27:32,230
oldest,
so we were there.

424
00:27:32,231 --> 00:27:37,231
So you can see that the usually east
really cloudy and the weather is good.

425
00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:40,420
So if you see documentaries
with being weaned on the song,

426
00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:45,130
that's not the normal thing.
They're usually really,

427
00:27:47,170 --> 00:27:51,190
that's how we work. So in the same
place, we have to have, we have plans,

428
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:53,970
we have the here, so we have the
meetings because I usually do,

429
00:27:53,971 --> 00:27:55,780
they'll hop so many saloons on level.

430
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:59,200
So this space is really sweetie pie.

431
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:04,850
You said all of these old, the kinds
of things we were doing this course.

432
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,190
So these people,

433
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:10,060
they were launching balloons and
Isabelle Lewis are used to measure the

434
00:28:10,090 --> 00:28:12,550
properties of the atmosphere.
For example,

435
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:17,020
deploying many different instruments.

436
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:19,913
Okay.

437
00:28:20,110 --> 00:28:23,760
What is this? So when I show this
picture to high schools to this,

438
00:28:23,770 --> 00:28:25,810
they told me what this is.
I Dunno.

439
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:30,760
Is Saturn or Jupiter or our planet?
So this is the Pacific Ocean.

440
00:28:30,790 --> 00:28:35,290
So if you, if you use, obviously you
do because you do use Google earth,

441
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,540
did you slept? I mean if you do a little
bit be a buck, so you will find these,

442
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:42,310
the Pacific Ocean is massive.

443
00:28:42,370 --> 00:28:45,550
Something that big that you
can pull all the continents,

444
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:49,990
all the land inside the Pacific Ocean.
And after that you will have,

445
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:52,660
you will leave a little
bit of Pacific Ocean.

446
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:57,550
The Pacific Ocean is really big and
as you can see there are clouds there.

447
00:28:58,030 --> 00:28:59,380
So what we have done this year,

448
00:28:59,381 --> 00:29:02,230
we went to these points in the
middle of the Pacific Ocean,

449
00:29:02,231 --> 00:29:04,780
which is Maria Island
in the French Polynesia.

450
00:29:04,781 --> 00:29:07,940
I don't know if you know where you start
heating so close with the heat either.

451
00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:08,860
It's Maria.
I love.

452
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:14,060
So we were there in order to study
these trace gases emission on by Murray.

453
00:29:14,110 --> 00:29:15,330
Microsoft's,
uh,

454
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:20,160
that was all the worry microbes
that are also from Colorado.

455
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:21,880
Reese is coral reef.

456
00:29:21,881 --> 00:29:25,210
They have differing in coral reef
ecosystems or they can't have different

457
00:29:25,211 --> 00:29:26,950
behavior or sunny spot and touristy.

458
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:30,400
So you have until the s I told you
in the beginning. So you need to,

459
00:29:30,650 --> 00:29:32,890
you need to understand
the ocean as a possible.

460
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:35,860
So you need to know how all of these is.

461
00:29:36,490 --> 00:29:39,160
These are in every part of the ocean.

462
00:29:40,610 --> 00:29:42,060
So that's Maria Island.
And we

463
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:44,970
were there, he said the
island, it's pretty cool.

464
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:49,640
So we were leaving here on
these houses on the one day,

465
00:29:50,170 --> 00:29:54,090
but it was really beautiful at night.
And this is unreal.

466
00:29:54,091 --> 00:29:55,290
I mean usually these kind of,

467
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:59,190
I mean when you came from the south and
ocean and you are right to the tropic

468
00:29:59,490 --> 00:30:00,281
tropical island,

469
00:30:00,281 --> 00:30:04,690
like this is really funny because he's
like living in an aquarium and you every

470
00:30:04,691 --> 00:30:07,730
time you die, if it's like you cannot
believe what you are saying because he's,

471
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:10,140
it's like fake,
but it's not fake.

472
00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:16,020
It's full of chorus and everything.
So this is the research team.

473
00:30:16,590 --> 00:30:20,130
We were there. We were yesterday
team people from four different,

474
00:30:20,131 --> 00:30:25,131
if it were for four different countries
for new year over in the states,

475
00:30:25,561 --> 00:30:29,870
from China, from Australia,
from, uh, Spain. Um,

476
00:30:30,150 --> 00:30:32,380
from friends too.
Okay.

477
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:37,680
This is the boat we use on that cruise.
That of course we'll either,

478
00:30:37,681 --> 00:30:40,970
they pull us in our careers,
we were working from a night
on the right. So every,

479
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:45,510
every day we do them all
down. We went sampling. And
this is the day, for example,

480
00:30:45,511 --> 00:30:49,260
in this picture, what we are doing
is deploying this rally your meter,

481
00:30:49,710 --> 00:30:54,060
which is an instrument that you can
use for measure. How, how, how's the,

482
00:30:54,070 --> 00:30:56,510
how, what is the, I mean, who,

483
00:30:56,511 --> 00:31:00,690
how are the properties of the
light and below the surface water.

484
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:04,350
So how lights be gay with the Dev,
for example,

485
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:07,710
which is an indicator of the
turbidity and these kind of things.

486
00:31:09,430 --> 00:31:12,620
And that's me working on the
boat. So you have to, uh, the,

487
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:14,410
he's the driver of the boat.

488
00:31:14,770 --> 00:31:19,540
Tony and I used to spend many hours
close to his feet working there.

489
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:20,540
We follow the coating.

490
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:23,980
So essentially it's like you have like
really fancy instrument and really

491
00:31:23,981 --> 00:31:28,950
expensive things, but mentally
you are, you know, you need to do,

492
00:31:28,951 --> 00:31:33,910
you need to adapt to the
circumstances. Um, so we,

493
00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:38,590
uh, we were doing, I mean, when we went
with the bolt sampling, for example,

494
00:31:38,591 --> 00:31:41,500
in Maria Aiello pictures from the right,

495
00:31:41,501 --> 00:31:46,300
so when we saw how this is the day
in green, you have the chlorophyll,

496
00:31:46,570 --> 00:31:51,030
which is an indicator of the
productivity of a community or,

497
00:31:51,031 --> 00:31:52,900
or the water,
like say let's say.

498
00:31:53,530 --> 00:31:58,420
So we saw that in the basic productivity
was higher than out of the reef and

499
00:31:58,450 --> 00:32:01,870
inside the roof.
So that's the thing we usually do.

500
00:32:02,110 --> 00:32:06,910
And we went to this small atolls in
the, in the north, which is [inaudible].

501
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,840
And here you have the bigger picture.
Um,

502
00:32:10,570 --> 00:32:15,270
so an angel is the, it's not, I mean
this angel, it was really different.

503
00:32:15,271 --> 00:32:17,000
And I'm Maria, right? Um,

504
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:20,980
it has inside that legroom and on the
productivity there was really high.

505
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:23,860
It was much higher than out
of the whole of the island,

506
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:26,620
which was something
really surprising for us.

507
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:31,360
So the last thing I would
like to tell you, it's about
science and society, right?

508
00:32:31,361 --> 00:32:34,120
So these kind of things are
very important. And you also,

509
00:32:34,121 --> 00:32:37,660
you have to explain them to the people.
You have to explain it to society.

510
00:32:39,950 --> 00:32:42,230
So this is model, it's not
a spin expedition, right?

511
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:46,910
Was an expedition performing an
18th century. Like by, by his thing,

512
00:32:47,290 --> 00:32:50,960
it was the first IMT if
[inaudible] the award sampling,

513
00:32:51,650 --> 00:32:55,520
leaving curators for an island.
So many different things.

514
00:32:56,180 --> 00:33:00,290
So in 2010 so eight years ago,

515
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:04,850
there was a Malaspina expedition, which
was a cruise sailing around the ocean,

516
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:08,630
right? Again, buzz, I spill Roman,
you see some feel really cool.

517
00:33:08,631 --> 00:33:13,330
So you have a massive bold full of
scientists traveling around the world.

518
00:33:13,370 --> 00:33:15,830
In seven months. We see something
that you may think, well,

519
00:33:15,831 --> 00:33:17,160
this is so easy to reach.

520
00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:20,970
So easy to engage with the
people on the pneumonia.

521
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:25,980
I was on my bachelor and I used to
read the blog and this wasn't as block.

522
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:31,700
So it's that. So here you
have, I mean, you don't have
to read it, but no pictures,

523
00:33:31,730 --> 00:33:33,080
no movies,
no nothing.

524
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:36,680
So do you have people sailing around
the globe doing really cool science?

525
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:41,980
You percentage like this?
Um, I'm actually this, this,

526
00:33:42,010 --> 00:33:43,480
this is how this one,
the,

527
00:33:43,550 --> 00:33:47,190
the offer of this writing is
one of the most famous is fine.

528
00:33:47,191 --> 00:33:52,191
It's Fraser says you will have on the
boat one of the best writers on the ward

529
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:57,480
and you are doing really cool things
and you present it like this with no

530
00:33:57,510 --> 00:34:01,460
parochial media though. No Twitter, no
Facebook, no nothing. So he mentally,

531
00:34:01,461 --> 00:34:03,560
no one will really few people.

532
00:34:03,561 --> 00:34:06,350
It's going to read this
unless you're a freak like me,

533
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:10,790
but if you want to engage, but if
you want to engage with these people,

534
00:34:11,030 --> 00:34:14,200
millennials. Huh? Well I did
relation on the two younger ones.

535
00:34:14,201 --> 00:34:17,000
So you need to use social media.
Um,

536
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:21,540
I agree with mine with my partner at
spoke in September, 2014, you know,

537
00:34:21,541 --> 00:34:24,670
are very good splay. They
said these eh, um, to,

538
00:34:24,830 --> 00:34:28,190
to explain and to read. But you
expedition, as I told you before,

539
00:34:28,191 --> 00:34:31,220
it will seem both
focusing on storytelling,

540
00:34:31,221 --> 00:34:33,540
adventure of the challenges of science on,

541
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:37,960
do you athlete from assign
these to the public or ma,

542
00:34:37,961 --> 00:34:39,860
I'm mostly focusing in John People.

543
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:45,530
So we have read them most in all of
these different places on their war,

544
00:34:46,090 --> 00:34:49,190
which he's quite and
quite cool in 40 years.

545
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:54,620
This is what I wanted to tell you.
Thank you. And if you have any question,

546
00:34:55,370 --> 00:34:56,540
we'll be happy to answer.

547
00:35:02,830 --> 00:35:07,260
And those results,
did you get from all these experiments?

548
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:12,550
Every on every ocean is different
on every experiments different.

549
00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:16,900
So the results we have with the
Easter, depending, for example,

550
00:35:16,901 --> 00:35:20,680
depending on the photo blogs and Spc.
So because you may think,

551
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:25,270
well if these tourists gas is related
to chlorophyll, so chlorophyll molecule,

552
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:29,020
which is the same, the water of the
organism, the molecule is the same.

553
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:33,970
So do you may think so maybe can we
kind of link the productions of discuss?

554
00:35:34,330 --> 00:35:39,270
Yes. To glorify him, but
actually it doesn't work
that, so depending on this PC,

555
00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:43,050
even no matter of the chlorophyll of
the level of chlorophyll of this PC,

556
00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:46,470
so the mission can be different
if the two basic gases.

557
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:48,190
But what does the response team were fun.

558
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:50,233
Yeah.

559
00:35:54,330 --> 00:35:57,930
I have a question from one of the
people who is not in this room. Um,

560
00:35:59,260 --> 00:35:59,510
yeah,

561
00:35:59,510 --> 00:36:02,100
he's thinking more towards
the global warming those.

562
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:04,190
So he says that every time our,

563
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:07,910
our CEO and our higher ups
talk about machine learning,

564
00:36:07,911 --> 00:36:12,800
he talks about the example of climate
change modeling and he's asking if you're

565
00:36:12,801 --> 00:36:15,860
aware of machine learning
initiatives to improve these models.

566
00:36:16,070 --> 00:36:20,480
But it seems like climb on modeling
within 150 years of data is still a good

567
00:36:20,481 --> 00:36:25,390
candidate for applying machine learning
to such, uh, such research. So what,

568
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:27,230
what's kind of your viewer experience?

569
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:30,990
Well, tell you what would I do
with the models I use. I mean,

570
00:36:30,991 --> 00:36:34,560
I'm not that modal little over and
then we'll usually usually, right.

571
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:39,670
So actually my intention with this
mall's either he's not, I mean the,

572
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:44,410
the final goal of this obviously is to
help the people do project the climate.

573
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:48,510
My Jaquelle goals, right? Uh,

574
00:36:48,930 --> 00:36:51,060
I am a word and now they're using these,

575
00:36:51,061 --> 00:36:54,170
these machine learning things
for incubation community,

576
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:58,380
bloody of the malls and also
quantum quantum computing to,

577
00:36:58,770 --> 00:37:03,390
so yes, I'm thinking something that is
a hot topic now. It's currently, I mean,

578
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:05,940
that's what my goals, but I'm not
that, I have no extra pieces of that.

579
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:08,093
Yeah.

580
00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:14,940
That's all because really enjoyable.
Um,

581
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:19,820
I'm wondering on your whole research team,

582
00:37:19,821 --> 00:37:23,690
how many people go out into the field
and gather the data and how many people

583
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:26,810
stay home and write code and run models.

584
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:30,230
And how's the interaction between you?
Because I'm considering,

585
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:36,950
well, it depends on the cruise, right?
For example, in one of the crews,

586
00:37:36,951 --> 00:37:41,810
the one that we did in these,
in these oceanographic vessel like this,

587
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:46,490
we, that's the Spanish basal. So
we have like 35 births for us,

588
00:37:46,730 --> 00:37:50,330
so that we were like 30 scientists to,
were working still.

589
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:54,770
Did people love do millennia stuff? He's
come face, usually they stay on them,

590
00:37:55,220 --> 00:38:00,010
but some nice not right. Um, so
for example, in these groups,

591
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:05,020
we were 30 scientists in the cruise
that we did around on 30 guy from my

592
00:38:07,101 --> 00:38:11,470
research group. We, yes. Got
Two places. So we were just too,

593
00:38:11,471 --> 00:38:15,200
it's funny is people there and we were,
you know, [inaudible] tiller every month.

594
00:38:15,650 --> 00:38:20,090
Um, so it depends on the groups and
on the island. The smallest of April,

595
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:23,270
we were 13 people.
So yeah,

596
00:38:23,271 --> 00:38:27,160
he depends on the also it
depends obviously the, the,

597
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:30,830
the more people you have
the better because you can
do more things and you kind

598
00:38:30,831 --> 00:38:35,000
of have more data about this.
Skanska Lee is something that you need to,

599
00:38:35,410 --> 00:38:39,120
I mean it's a kind of science that
is quite complex because isn't it?

600
00:38:39,121 --> 00:38:42,210
Clearly you have to take your lab.
I'm more with,

601
00:38:42,740 --> 00:38:46,990
I feel that we take our lab and we put
it inside the boat and the boat is never

602
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:47,681
in Barcelona.

603
00:38:47,681 --> 00:38:52,600
So we have to go to Germany or to
whatever and you need to take all of our

604
00:38:52,601 --> 00:38:53,410
instruments there.

605
00:38:53,410 --> 00:38:58,300
We put in a boat and sales around the
world and after you became out of, um,

606
00:38:58,870 --> 00:39:03,220
so he's, that's a complex thing. But I
want to say that that's expensive too.

607
00:39:03,990 --> 00:39:08,110
So the more people, the better, the more
people, the more expressive abilities.

608
00:39:08,470 --> 00:39:11,890
So the St Kelly, do you need to
think? I need to, you need to have,

609
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:15,390
clearly you're and I will, what I have,
what I want to do to these people.

610
00:39:15,850 --> 00:39:16,271
You're not,

611
00:39:16,271 --> 00:39:20,920
so usually try to keep the number
of people a slower as possible,

612
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:25,130
um,
that will help you to have your,

613
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:28,560
your scientific goals.
Yeah.

614
00:39:34,610 --> 00:39:39,390
So you mentioned, uh, different types
of photosynthesis has different,

615
00:39:40,210 --> 00:39:41,043
uh,

616
00:39:41,650 --> 00:39:46,650
to affect like the amount of pipe and
Joseph mission by net amount of bacteria,

617
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:53,570
or at least

618
00:40:12,270 --> 00:40:16,970
it's mostly because of the animals of
the animals off the plant. Right. So,

619
00:40:17,210 --> 00:40:18,160
so the bigger is

620
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:22,340
going to be producing it,

621
00:40:22,341 --> 00:40:25,580
so there'd be your east always needed
more than what we produce is the same way

622
00:40:25,581 --> 00:40:29,940
if you read, do our release in Morsia
too than, um, than a mouse problem.

623
00:40:30,290 --> 00:40:35,030
So it's something similar to that.
So you have more biomass,

624
00:40:35,870 --> 00:40:40,070
all that Mark Morford doesn't getting
higher biomass on land. I mean the old,

625
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:43,260
but the point is that their
bio mass in the ocean, so

626
00:40:44,890 --> 00:40:49,790
it becomes recycled faster,
you know, because they're
essentially microbes. Right.

627
00:40:49,791 --> 00:40:54,260
And they die, but they, they can be by the
cells. You have to offend. You have free.

628
00:40:54,470 --> 00:40:59,440
So the bio mass is lower than
in Donny land past. Yeah.

629
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:01,260
That's reasonable.

630
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:12,590
Not One I had. No, I did.
Uh, did I include the side?

631
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:22,930
Okay. Okay. Ah, yeah. That's
my, that's my, that's my two,

632
00:41:22,931 --> 00:41:26,410
three theater user if you mean.
Oh yeah.

633
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:29,660
Okay.
Well is the same.

634
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:33,133
Yeah.

635
00:41:34,670 --> 00:41:35,580
So you said that,

636
00:41:35,730 --> 00:41:40,520
but he's the plans to release more as
a friend because they are important.

637
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:42,320
Why is it not the same with oxygen?

638
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:45,680
You said that to the oxygen is
mostly released by these microbes.

639
00:41:45,830 --> 00:41:50,540
Well because that's how you're really
good as good as him because I actually did

640
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:55,210
a, we usually land ecosystems,
right? They love steak.

641
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:59,450
The plus data for the,
but they also, they bring,

642
00:41:59,750 --> 00:42:03,170
let's say they also consume
oxygen sometimes, right?

643
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:07,880
So when you have an ecosystem which is
mature, right? Like the rain forest,

644
00:42:08,140 --> 00:42:11,090
they're producing data. They are
producing a little of folks senior about,

645
00:42:11,091 --> 00:42:15,170
they're consuming a lot of
oxygen to cells. Hailey, you're,

646
00:42:15,171 --> 00:42:17,120
your balance is lady some,

647
00:42:17,121 --> 00:42:21,590
some parts of the London
ecosystem is zero.

648
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:27,520
So I think the older and these organisms
are dying and leaving the gang.

649
00:42:27,591 --> 00:42:31,200
I'm the level. So he's play
is that's heavy for the thing.

650
00:42:32,290 --> 00:42:33,123
Yeah.

651
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:40,440
I sailed through a tall ship through
the Drake's passage half a year ago and

652
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:45,210
yeah, it was really bad. Um, I wanted
to comment on, on your common desk.

653
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:49,610
Um,
like research vessels,

654
00:42:49,611 --> 00:42:51,050
like the one that I was on,

655
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:56,420
we could use money for like keeping
the business after running a day.

656
00:42:57,681 --> 00:43:00,230
Also collect samples.
Uh,

657
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:05,180
like we used to measure part of our
daily chores was to measure the water

658
00:43:05,270 --> 00:43:09,310
temperature and sometimes
the examples and um,

659
00:43:10,180 --> 00:43:10,730
okay,

660
00:43:10,730 --> 00:43:14,480
these data,
is he 42 some other agencies?

661
00:43:14,481 --> 00:43:19,481
I don't remember exactly where in
exchange for a small amount of money in my

662
00:43:20,991 --> 00:43:25,490
understanding was that this
kind of research feeds, uh,
is kind of small samples.

663
00:43:25,670 --> 00:43:30,670
Data feeds into like larger research at
a global level and there are other boats

664
00:43:32,151 --> 00:43:36,860
like this that you can volunteer
on or you can just join them for,

665
00:43:37,940 --> 00:43:40,460
I don't know,
five weeks from Cape Town to the Azores.

666
00:43:40,490 --> 00:43:45,490
Or I went from [inaudible]
to Ben Antarctic Peninsula
and back in those 22 days

667
00:43:46,761 --> 00:43:50,430
or the same, uh, shy
Antarctic pennies. Ah, AH,

668
00:43:50,630 --> 00:43:52,730
Georgian islands in Cape Town.

669
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:58,120
And we collected the sword of samples
every eight hours come whatever kind of

670
00:44:00,411 --> 00:44:02,450
weather and dizziness and so on.

671
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:07,790
So I think there's maybe opportunity if
you're interested to look into what kind

672
00:44:07,791 --> 00:44:12,791
of research these data ends up being
used for and if there's some sort of more

673
00:44:13,401 --> 00:44:15,950
intelligent machine learning
and things that we could,

674
00:44:16,210 --> 00:44:19,250
or one could contribute
if there's interest.

675
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:22,993
Okay.

676
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:32,420
Have some sort of website like
that and probably that was, yeah,

677
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:39,773
yeah.

678
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:45,150
Uh, Evan to lead, you can join us on a
research cruise, but actually in order to,

679
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:48,660
that was healthy that the has been doing
like during the last day. It's like,

680
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:52,770
yeah, yes. Launching those hills and
people doing, they're measuring enough,

681
00:44:52,771 --> 00:44:54,780
they're sharing everything
and put everything together.

682
00:44:54,990 --> 00:44:59,370
Now this trend is seen of these
quite trendy is the Argo float.

683
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:02,010
I don't know if you have deliver
ever listen about Argo floats.

684
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:06,750
So essentially there are
boys, right? Like these ones,

685
00:45:09,210 --> 00:45:12,720
can you help me low? Can you
go there you go, hold on.

686
00:45:12,721 --> 00:45:15,730
And they seem to not have two satellites
on there. So they are perfect.

687
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:20,000
They're not simply floating there.
Go with deeper Nicola afterwards.

688
00:45:20,450 --> 00:45:23,570
So on the, so the Argo flower,
the Argo floats, sorry,

689
00:45:23,990 --> 00:45:26,810
are all the argue boys
that are in the ocean,

690
00:45:26,811 --> 00:45:30,020
which is this in February, 2018. Right?

691
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:34,780
So the ocean as many of
these are the flows. Um,

692
00:45:34,790 --> 00:45:36,640
usually they own most of them.
I mean,

693
00:45:36,650 --> 00:45:41,170
almost every gun three they have a group
in charge of deploying the Argo floats.

694
00:45:41,180 --> 00:45:43,700
Do do is change the Chantilly,
deploy them on when they uh,

695
00:45:43,701 --> 00:45:45,520
run off battery elder butter.

696
00:45:45,521 --> 00:45:49,070
He said you've picked them up and you
do repairs and you launch it again,

697
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:50,540
which is so thing,

698
00:45:50,541 --> 00:45:55,541
which is cheaper than send
people is safer to me girls,

699
00:45:56,740 --> 00:46:00,470
if our boy becomes broken,
no one's eyes.

700
00:46:01,850 --> 00:46:03,750
Yeah.
Yeah.

701
00:46:18,220 --> 00:46:19,053
Okay.
So,

702
00:46:21,350 --> 00:46:21,930
uh,

703
00:46:21,930 --> 00:46:26,550
it says you are studying what looks
like a positive feedback loops towards

704
00:46:26,551 --> 00:46:31,320
global warming. Any chances it can
offset the major negative feedback loops?

705
00:46:31,321 --> 00:46:35,820
Like I'll be the loss from ice melting.
COC decreasing Sio two storage,

706
00:46:35,821 --> 00:46:39,600
permafrost, melting
releases, ch four and so on.

707
00:46:40,220 --> 00:46:41,053
Yeah.

708
00:46:41,370 --> 00:46:45,280
What is that with climate change?
And usually because, I mean we, we,

709
00:46:45,510 --> 00:46:48,570
we usually tends to understand
climate change as global warming.

710
00:46:48,940 --> 00:46:51,330
Exactly it is now is global warming.

711
00:46:51,660 --> 00:46:55,950
But if you have a really high global
warming, do you even count, you know,

712
00:46:55,951 --> 00:47:00,390
gloves she'll glacial period.
Right. So something quite tricky.

713
00:47:00,391 --> 00:47:03,450
For example, if, if all of the,

714
00:47:03,451 --> 00:47:06,840
for example that he or
he was saying if the,

715
00:47:06,841 --> 00:47:10,080
if the ice melts in
the Arctic for example,

716
00:47:10,170 --> 00:47:15,060
so the temperature of the ocean
will be higher on a, I don't really,

717
00:47:15,061 --> 00:47:19,170
if you are a word,
the heating machine of the earth are,

718
00:47:19,171 --> 00:47:20,310
the oceans are saying Kelly,

719
00:47:20,311 --> 00:47:24,300
you half a convention belt
hole throw the oceans,

720
00:47:24,301 --> 00:47:28,470
which is called a terrible
Holly circulation. Um,

721
00:47:28,530 --> 00:47:30,730
east a saint.
Really it's like a river.

722
00:47:30,780 --> 00:47:35,560
You just slowly for a one place to
another one transporting eat, right.

723
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:39,400
So if they'll sharing, for
example, if the Arctic,

724
00:47:39,401 --> 00:47:42,880
I mean we are in Switzerland, I
don't know if you, well you know,

725
00:47:42,890 --> 00:47:44,500
Love Madrid for example,

726
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:49,560
because the lesson it is more or less
in the same latitude than New York,

727
00:47:50,940 --> 00:47:54,730
but the temperature is totally different.
You, your patent, you have seen movies,

728
00:47:54,731 --> 00:47:57,910
bright eyes response,
every face full of snow.

729
00:47:57,911 --> 00:48:00,970
And usually in Spain we don't
have that. Or, or in Lisbon,

730
00:48:00,971 --> 00:48:05,971
which is largely to that is because in
the North Atlantic Ocean we have this

731
00:48:06,791 --> 00:48:10,690
commercial belt of, of water,
which is called the Emoc,

732
00:48:10,870 --> 00:48:14,710
a mock Lutie, Stearns, Arctic, very
regional overturning circulation.

733
00:48:16,580 --> 00:48:21,350
So then we're warm waters that are,

734
00:48:22,130 --> 00:48:26,140
that they have, they have,
I mean they, the, they have,

735
00:48:26,150 --> 00:48:27,390
they are warm because the,

736
00:48:27,530 --> 00:48:32,530
the signing day waiter gets the water
that the water flows north of low self do

737
00:48:33,471 --> 00:48:36,530
as health an ocean to the
article in the Atlantic Ocean,

738
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:40,740
right when they arrive to
the North Pole or the Arctic,

739
00:48:41,840 --> 00:48:45,520
they get to cool David colder.
Right? And if they are cooler,

740
00:48:46,100 --> 00:48:48,500
they go down,
right?

741
00:48:49,070 --> 00:48:53,990
So they go down after they are
doing their way back but below.

742
00:48:54,260 --> 00:48:57,110
Right.
And this has had an atmos very clean too.

743
00:48:57,170 --> 00:48:59,980
So essentially we have
this warm temperatures in,

744
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:04,700
in Europe rather than in America because
of this, because of the circulation.

745
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:10,010
But if the Arctic is warmer, the
CFTC stipulation, the mock can be,

746
00:49:10,070 --> 00:49:13,520
can be broken or can be, um, or, or your,

747
00:49:13,521 --> 00:49:16,520
or even if that's
regulation is just lower.

748
00:49:16,580 --> 00:49:20,270
It kind of really changed
the whole of Europe.

749
00:49:21,010 --> 00:49:23,290
And it will be colder.
So mentally,

750
00:49:23,380 --> 00:49:27,650
if you do have a lot of a lot of flow
where you can have a glass show and not a

751
00:49:27,651 --> 00:49:30,050
glacial period,
or maybe a glacial period,

752
00:49:30,051 --> 00:49:33,620
but much lower 10 producing
places of you have never had,

753
00:49:34,820 --> 00:49:38,030
well,
we have never had in the last selenium's.

754
00:49:39,630 --> 00:49:40,463
Yeah.

755
00:49:41,330 --> 00:49:42,430
Such a drinking game.

756
00:49:46,930 --> 00:49:47,540
Thanks.
See you.
