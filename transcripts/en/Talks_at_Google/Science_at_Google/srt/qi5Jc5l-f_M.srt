1
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:08,840
I said, welcome Dr Starkey. Thank you. Uh,

2
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:11,700
I know that we want to get to the point
of talking about how these things are

3
00:00:11,701 --> 00:00:15,390
going to kill all of us and we're all
doomed. Uh, but before we do that,

4
00:00:15,391 --> 00:00:16,650
before we get started about that,
we should,

5
00:00:16,651 --> 00:00:19,230
we should talk a little about about what
these things are that are going to kill

6
00:00:19,231 --> 00:00:23,910
us all. Um, so, uh, your, your book
of course is a, a nonfiction book,

7
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:26,310
but I couldn't help thinking while
reading it, that if it were a novel,

8
00:00:26,311 --> 00:00:28,650
the main characters in it
would be comets and asteroids.

9
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:30,140
So maybe we should start there.

10
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:33,300
Talk about a little bit about what
comets and asteroids are and how they are

11
00:00:33,301 --> 00:00:34,134
different from each other.

12
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:38,890
Sure. Okay. So, um, I guess there's a lot
of misunderstanding now about what the,

13
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:41,390
what the differences between
comments and asteroids. Um,

14
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:45,760
so classically we had this idea that
comments forms and the very cold outer

15
00:00:45,761 --> 00:00:48,220
reaches of the solar system.
So when our son first formed,

16
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:52,870
it was surrounded by this cloud of gas
and dust and ice and way out in the outer

17
00:00:52,871 --> 00:00:56,040
reaches of the solar system. We pass
where any of the planets are today. Um,

18
00:00:56,170 --> 00:00:57,910
we formed the comments and
they're literally just like,

19
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:00,760
as I describe it as like
a scoop of this cloud,

20
00:01:00,761 --> 00:01:04,420
he'd basically just take this gas and
dust and ice and kind of bind it together

21
00:01:04,421 --> 00:01:06,700
a little bit, but they're not
very well like held together.

22
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,260
They're not very well consolidated.

23
00:01:08,261 --> 00:01:12,010
So they're almost like a snowball
essentially with a lot of Dustin. Um,

24
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:15,310
but what why they're so important
is that they're exceptionally old.

25
00:01:15,311 --> 00:01:18,430
So there was old as the sun,
4.6 billion years old,

26
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:21,550
which means they can tell us a
lot about where we came from,

27
00:01:21,551 --> 00:01:23,190
where everything in our
solar system came from.

28
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:24,700
Right.
Did they sort of primitive object.

29
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:27,640
Exactly. Um, whereas the
asteroids are at hand,

30
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:31,660
they're also very old with saying
probably nearly 4.6 if not four,

31
00:01:31,661 --> 00:01:33,730
paid for just about 4.5 billion years old.

32
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,290
And we can think of those as kind of
the leftover building rubble from making

33
00:01:38,291 --> 00:01:41,480
the planet. So they formed in the inner
solar system much closer to the sun,

34
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:45,560
just as the rocky planets did like us
and then mercury, Venus and Mars. Um,

35
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:49,120
and it was just those bits and pieces
of planet that didn't get made into a

36
00:01:49,121 --> 00:01:53,140
planet. They just got left out. And then
they collected, um, in the asteroid belt,

37
00:01:53,141 --> 00:01:55,420
which is now between Mars and Jupiter.
Um,

38
00:01:55,421 --> 00:01:59,350
so the asteroids are really important
because they preserve this history of

39
00:01:59,351 --> 00:02:02,770
planet building, which is really hard to
look at because if we just take earth,

40
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:06,580
we've had all sorts of evolution on
earth since it formed and we have plate

41
00:02:06,581 --> 00:02:10,330
tectonics as most people know.
So especially living in La,

42
00:02:10,331 --> 00:02:13,080
you probably know too well that was an
earthquake last night actually, that,

43
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:13,800
you know,

44
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,650
our plates are moving and we create
earthquakes and volcanoes and this changes

45
00:02:17,651 --> 00:02:20,680
the surface of our planet. So if we
want to go back to the beginning of us,

46
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:24,550
we want to see what it was made from
and how it started out and how life got

47
00:02:24,551 --> 00:02:27,130
here and how our water got here.
It's really hard to do.

48
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,990
It's really hard to
pick apart that history.

49
00:02:28,991 --> 00:02:31,950
So asteroids are really important in
that sense. They can kind of allow us to,

50
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:35,920
to glimpse back at that time because they
didn't really evolve since the forms,

51
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:38,710
not a whole lot anyway.
They sort of preserve those conditions.

52
00:02:38,711 --> 00:02:40,510
So that's the classic view.

53
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:44,680
I think we're going to come onto in a
bit kind of how that view is maybe not so

54
00:02:44,681 --> 00:02:47,860
accurate now. It's not
wholly wrong, but, um,

55
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,470
but we've kind of updated
our view about these objects,

56
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:53,560
but we should remember that
that's the classical distinction.

57
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:57,450
And I love that that image
of the asteroids is kind
of the leftover legos from

58
00:02:57,451 --> 00:02:58,470
the solar system.

59
00:02:58,471 --> 00:03:01,060
You snap the whole bunch of
things together into planets
and these are the ones

60
00:03:01,061 --> 00:03:02,020
that are kind of scattered on the floor.

61
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:02,940
Yep.

62
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:05,010
That's right. Yeah. Yeah. And, um,

63
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:07,620
and so because these might might
come into the picture as well,

64
00:03:07,621 --> 00:03:12,330
can we talk a little about what, uh, uh,
meteors and meteorites and meteoroids are?

65
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:15,280
Yeah. So, okay. That there's a
lot of confusion about that. So I,

66
00:03:15,281 --> 00:03:19,150
me to write is literally just a piece
of rock from space on another planet.

67
00:03:19,151 --> 00:03:21,610
So on earth we can go and collect me,
tried sitting on the ground.

68
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:23,470
And it could be a piece of a planet,

69
00:03:23,471 --> 00:03:25,300
it could be a piece of a
comment or an asteroid.

70
00:03:25,301 --> 00:03:28,690
And what happens is that collisions
happening happen in space and they've

71
00:03:28,691 --> 00:03:32,800
happened for Millennia and little pieces
of rocks will get knocked off planets.

72
00:03:32,801 --> 00:03:34,990
If another is an asteroid
collides with them.

73
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:37,780
And some of this asteroid might end
up just floating about in space,

74
00:03:37,781 --> 00:03:41,590
but little pieces of it.
So it's a meteoroid and space.

75
00:03:41,591 --> 00:03:44,500
And then when it comes
through the atmosphere, it's
becomes a mature. So you got,

76
00:03:44,501 --> 00:03:47,980
we had the meteor shower recently that
you can see little pieces coming through

77
00:03:47,981 --> 00:03:50,320
often that stuff.
So when we get a big fireball,

78
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:54,220
these beautiful scenes that we get, that's
a larger piece of rock coming through.

79
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,350
If that rock makes it to the surface,

80
00:03:56,351 --> 00:03:59,950
if it doesn't explode in the atmosphere
and completely disintegrate a piece of

81
00:03:59,951 --> 00:04:01,360
rock on the surface as the meats,
right?

82
00:04:01,361 --> 00:04:04,300
So the great thing about them
is that we can collect them.

83
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:06,910
Sometimes we can actually see them
forward. If you see a fire ball,

84
00:04:06,911 --> 00:04:11,350
you can sometimes trace it and then find
that fresh rock literally just straight

85
00:04:11,351 --> 00:04:14,770
from space and you can solve it.
Or we get older falls where you know,

86
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:18,310
there's a court fines where we've kind of,
they felt while ago,

87
00:04:18,311 --> 00:04:21,820
it could be millions of years ago. Um,
and we can then go and sample them.

88
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:25,570
And it's great because it means we can
get samples from space because we don't

89
00:04:25,571 --> 00:04:30,070
actually go into space very often. Like
we going to space a bit. And when we do,

90
00:04:30,071 --> 00:04:33,640
we often don't collect samples because
if we want to go out and collect samples

91
00:04:33,641 --> 00:04:36,320
and spaces, almost like two
missions. Do you want to like this?

92
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:37,720
The why we haven't sampled Mars.

93
00:04:37,721 --> 00:04:41,920
And people find that quite surprising
when I say we don't have any samples from

94
00:04:41,921 --> 00:04:45,430
Mars. We've been there a whole lot.
There's loads of instruments on Mars,

95
00:04:45,431 --> 00:04:50,290
but we haven't brought back any, any
rocks from there because yeah, right.

96
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:54,370
So we need to, we will be, we
will be doing it in the future.

97
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:57,290
Right now at the moment, the only
rocks we have from Mars Mitch Rights.

98
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:00,160
So that's the only way we can sample them.
They're free samples, which is great.

99
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:02,010
Right? But we don't know
exactly where they came from.

100
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:03,160
So if we send a mission there,

101
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:05,830
we consomme politically is that clean
a particular base and that we're

102
00:05:05,831 --> 00:05:07,720
interested in and then
we can bring that back.

103
00:05:07,721 --> 00:05:10,420
But that's basically a
second mission to launch,

104
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:13,610
relaunch off another planet or
an asteroid or a comment. It's,

105
00:05:13,611 --> 00:05:17,170
it's really complicated. So that's
why we haven't done it very often.

106
00:05:17,171 --> 00:05:19,830
Obviously we have a lot of samples from
the moon, thank goodness. So that's right.

107
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:21,910
Yeah, we've done it a bit,
but we need to do it more.

108
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,570
But we have meet traits in the meantime,
which can really help us out. Right.

109
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:28,580
Okay. So the, so the asteroids all live,

110
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:32,210
well not all live but mainly
collected in the asteroid belt,

111
00:05:32,211 --> 00:05:35,840
which is this region between the
orbits of Mars and Jupiter. Yup. Um,

112
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:38,450
and they're the asteroid belt,
uh,

113
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:41,150
I learned from your book isn't
really all one thing, right?

114
00:05:41,151 --> 00:05:43,520
There's like an inner and an outer belt
and there was a distinction between

115
00:05:43,521 --> 00:05:44,560
those two regions.
You to talk about that.

116
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:47,610
Yes. So when we studied
asteroids and asteroid belt,

117
00:05:47,611 --> 00:05:49,650
we kind of initially thought they
were all going to be the same,

118
00:05:49,651 --> 00:05:53,190
just these kind of rocky objects
that look a bit like, you know,

119
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:56,340
failed planets and,
and the small and they're all very small.

120
00:05:56,341 --> 00:05:58,000
There are a couple of large objects that,

121
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:01,280
but actually when we look in
detail from the inner belt,

122
00:06:01,281 --> 00:06:02,990
which is going to be the
bit that's closer to Mars,

123
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:05,660
I'm sure enough these things do
look like asteroids. In fact,

124
00:06:05,661 --> 00:06:07,250
some of them are made
completely of metals.

125
00:06:07,251 --> 00:06:10,250
So if you take the core of
earth that is made of metal,

126
00:06:10,251 --> 00:06:11,780
we'll probably aware of that.

127
00:06:11,781 --> 00:06:15,590
But actually we can sample a sort of
core from a planet if we sample some of

128
00:06:15,591 --> 00:06:19,430
these asteroids and there's a Nasa mission
actually going, um, in the twenties,

129
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:22,250
twenties called psyche and it's going
to be going to look at one of these

130
00:06:22,251 --> 00:06:24,200
objects so we can sample those.

131
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,690
And they're very much like we
consider the classical asteroids.

132
00:06:26,691 --> 00:06:29,810
But as we move out to the outer
belts on that kind of Jupiter side,

133
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:33,840
what we find is that they change
and they actually become IC.

134
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:36,980
Some of these objects and they have
a lot of carbonaceous materials.

135
00:06:36,981 --> 00:06:39,070
So what I'm saying here is that we,

136
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:41,390
we've got organic matter
now that's not uncommon.

137
00:06:41,391 --> 00:06:44,600
We have organic matter in most of the
asteroids apart from the ones that are

138
00:06:44,601 --> 00:06:47,360
really made of just a
metal. Um, this isn't life.

139
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:49,520
People get very excited when we
see organic methods. It's not life.

140
00:06:49,521 --> 00:06:53,660
It's literally just carbon,
hydrogen bonding and some oxygen and it's,

141
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:57,440
it's organic matter that is
potentially the precursor for life.

142
00:06:57,441 --> 00:06:58,850
So it's really exciting.

143
00:06:58,851 --> 00:07:02,300
These objects contain a lot of organic
matter because we still don't understand

144
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:03,990
how life got to earth.
Um,

145
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:07,740
we're obviously the only planet
we know of that contains life. Um,

146
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:10,790
we don't know how I got here and it's
kind of just, it's ridiculous, right?

147
00:07:10,791 --> 00:07:14,690
I always find it quite funny that we
still don't know how we are here and we're

148
00:07:14,691 --> 00:07:17,330
like these very intelligent beings that
can do all sorts of amazing things.

149
00:07:17,331 --> 00:07:21,660
But how we got her as a mystery. So
we want to study these objects, um,

150
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:23,870
to try and understand if they
could have delivered life.

151
00:07:23,871 --> 00:07:27,050
So these asteroids on the outer belt,
they also contain ice.

152
00:07:27,051 --> 00:07:30,110
So they look very much like the comments
that I described at the beginning.

153
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:33,800
And actually this is where this kind
of distinction between the two objects

154
00:07:33,801 --> 00:07:37,250
breaks down a little bit because these
actually might be comments when they

155
00:07:37,251 --> 00:07:40,790
formed. The idea is that some
of them really could have
formed in the outer solar

156
00:07:40,791 --> 00:07:41,570
system.

157
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:44,510
And then there was a huge reorganization
of the solar system after the large

158
00:07:44,511 --> 00:07:45,230
planets formed.

159
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:49,580
And some of these comments kind of got
thrown into the inner solar system and

160
00:07:49,581 --> 00:07:51,170
got trapped in the asteroid belt.

161
00:07:51,171 --> 00:07:54,650
So we actually find that they're kind
of comments, but they are asteroids.

162
00:07:54,651 --> 00:07:58,760
So it's kind of confusing in that respect.
But the same happen the other way.

163
00:07:58,761 --> 00:08:02,720
Some of the asteroids that formed near
the Sun got ejected out of the solar

164
00:08:02,721 --> 00:08:02,961
system.

165
00:08:02,961 --> 00:08:06,650
Some of them probably disappeared from
our solar system completely and others

166
00:08:06,651 --> 00:08:10,330
ended up in one of their homes of
where the comments live now. Um,

167
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:14,110
so there's probably almost certainly
some objects in what we call the Co,

168
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:18,650
the quip about where Pluto lives,
which probably asteroidal in origin,

169
00:08:18,651 --> 00:08:21,380
but now they're sitting somewhere
very cold. So there is a bill.

170
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:24,340
This is where kind of the
overlap starts to happen, right,

171
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:26,300
because the cell systems kind of crazy.

172
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:29,750
I love that image from your book of of
Jupiter sort of throwing a tantrum and

173
00:08:29,751 --> 00:08:32,390
rampaging around the solar system and
kind of throwing stuff all over the place

174
00:08:32,391 --> 00:08:34,670
and kind of mixing it all up
so it's not in range, you know,

175
00:08:34,671 --> 00:08:37,210
and this kind of neat, tidy little
categories that we thought at first.

176
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:38,240
I think that's the thing.

177
00:08:38,241 --> 00:08:41,390
We had this beautiful fee because of the
solar system is very hard to understand.

178
00:08:41,391 --> 00:08:44,690
Obviously we need to visit it to
understand it. And we haven't been too,

179
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,070
I mean we've been to a lot of it,

180
00:08:46,071 --> 00:08:49,670
but we still don't know how all the
planets formed. And Jupiter is enormous.

181
00:08:49,671 --> 00:08:50,150
Like it's,

182
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:54,950
it really controls our solar system
and it's gravity if it decides to move

183
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:58,290
around, which he did in the past, um,
can just really cause havoc throughout,

184
00:08:58,291 --> 00:09:00,070
you know,
it can just not planets around and,

185
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:03,780
and particularly smaller objects
like asteroids. Um, so that is,

186
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:08,330
that period of our solar system
history is very, very crazy. Sorry.

187
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:12,090
Yeah, you talked about it yet. Swapping
the orbits of Uranus and Neptune.

188
00:09:12,091 --> 00:09:14,850
So Neptune is further out
currently and Uranus is closer in,

189
00:09:14,851 --> 00:09:17,170
but they were the other way around.
This is what we think.

190
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:21,800
Yeah. And these are massive planets, you
know, and, and they have huge gravity.

191
00:09:21,801 --> 00:09:24,980
So it's kind of crazy thing. And
obviously it's not going to happen now,

192
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:28,940
but what we can do now is look out to
other solar systems around other planets,

193
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:30,440
planetary systems,
around other stars.

194
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:33,830
And we can kind of look at what
is happening now. So I love that.

195
00:09:33,831 --> 00:09:35,000
This is not my field,

196
00:09:35,001 --> 00:09:38,360
but this is astronomy and it's absolutely
fascinating that we can look out and

197
00:09:38,361 --> 00:09:39,110
see,

198
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:42,680
we can kind of see our solar system as
it was billions of years ago because we

199
00:09:42,681 --> 00:09:46,880
can look at other stars and see actually
planets forming at this very time,

200
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,320
what kind of,
what's happening here.

201
00:09:48,321 --> 00:09:52,460
So this is another way we can try and
figure out what happened 4.6 billion years

202
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:54,410
ago and afterwards.
So it's fascinating.

203
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:58,470
Right on. Um, so, so in much the
same way that the, there's a,

204
00:09:58,471 --> 00:10:01,170
there's these kind of two
regions of the asteroid belt.

205
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,920
There's kind of two regions of the,
where the comments live as well.

206
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,130
You talked about the Kuyper belt,

207
00:10:05,131 --> 00:10:07,590
which is the near region and there's
also the Oort cloud because the farther

208
00:10:07,591 --> 00:10:10,830
region you want to talk
about the distinction between
those two regions as well.

209
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:12,770
Yeah. How far away they are. Yes.

210
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:17,040
It's kind of crazy. Um, so this
sentence is in space always.

211
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:18,900
I think everyone just goes,
oh yeah, it's pretty far.

212
00:10:18,901 --> 00:10:22,290
It's like really far to Jupiter and Pluto.

213
00:10:22,291 --> 00:10:24,720
We know he went to Pluto with the
new horizons mission recently,

214
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:28,140
and it's still going through
the quip about, so you know,
a couple of years later,

215
00:10:28,141 --> 00:10:30,750
I think it was 2015 it met three times.
Um,

216
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:32,950
and it's still going
through the for bouts.

217
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:36,660
So it is 25 times wider
than the asteroid belt.

218
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,130
And the asteroid belt is
already fairly large. Right.

219
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:43,770
And it's just in terms of distances,
it's not that far.

220
00:10:43,771 --> 00:10:47,170
So it's just past Neptune Uranus.

221
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,860
It's kind of just on the
edge of the solar system.

222
00:10:49,861 --> 00:10:52,500
But these objects that are
there that I see that dusty,

223
00:10:52,501 --> 00:10:56,010
the kind of mostly fairly small
and we can see most of them,

224
00:10:56,011 --> 00:10:58,580
so we kind of know roughly what is there,

225
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,680
but they're sort of bound
to our son by the gravity.

226
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,590
They're not too far that they're
not kind of bound west the system.

227
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:08,790
But once you get to the edge of the quote
about it sort of becomes no man's land.

228
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:11,340
Um, we have a region called
the stack scattered desk,

229
00:11:11,341 --> 00:11:15,180
which is just some random objects,
which are probably mostly cometary. Um,

230
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:18,870
and they're kind of on crazy orbits a
little bit and we don't understand them a

231
00:11:18,871 --> 00:11:22,470
whole lot, but they are, we can't
see all of them, but they're kind of,

232
00:11:22,471 --> 00:11:23,400
we know that they're there.

233
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:26,220
But then we get to this theoretical
phase of the solar system,

234
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:28,020
which is the Oort cloud.
Um,

235
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:31,140
and I was fascinated to learn
what I did a few years ago,

236
00:11:31,141 --> 00:11:34,560
that the Oort cloud is not
proven like theoretical.

237
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:39,090
And we always talk about all Clark
comments and new day we have what we call

238
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:40,020
long period comments,

239
00:11:40,021 --> 00:11:43,320
which are these comments that come into
the inner solar system and orbit the sun.

240
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:46,050
Um, and they have to have more
bits of more than 200 years.

241
00:11:46,051 --> 00:11:48,870
So the way we know that awkward is there,

242
00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:51,840
partly because we have to balance out
the mass of the solar system somehow.

243
00:11:51,841 --> 00:11:54,850
So we kind of, you know, know guests
there had to be something out there,

244
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,550
but then we get these
comments coming in at it,

245
00:11:56,551 --> 00:11:58,840
really round random angles into that.

246
00:11:58,841 --> 00:12:03,190
So basically I should probably just
sidestep a little bit. The solar system,

247
00:12:03,191 --> 00:12:07,110
as most people know, all the planets on
the same plane. And so as a quick about,

248
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,460
so we're sort of all going
around the sun and nicely,

249
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:13,240
Pluto's doing something slightly
different and then we move out to the Oort

250
00:12:13,241 --> 00:12:17,290
cloud. And this is literally a cloud
around the whole sun. So what happens is,

251
00:12:17,291 --> 00:12:20,200
is one, one of these comments decides
to come into the inner solar system.

252
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:22,000
They can come in from all random angles.

253
00:12:22,001 --> 00:12:23,410
They're not going to be
coming along with that plane.

254
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:26,560
So that's how we sort of know this cloud
is there because these are the little

255
00:12:26,561 --> 00:12:29,980
visitors from the outer solar system
come in and, and we can spot them,

256
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:33,730
but we can't directly see them if they're
there because they're just too far.

257
00:12:33,731 --> 00:12:36,100
Right. You know, these objects
are tiny and they're too far away.

258
00:12:36,101 --> 00:12:39,010
So this is partly why until
new horizons got to Pluto,

259
00:12:39,011 --> 00:12:40,150
we didn't really know much about it.

260
00:12:40,151 --> 00:12:42,430
Like we just could not
really see it in any detail.

261
00:12:42,431 --> 00:12:46,310
So I'm really excited to see the next
object is going to in the queef about, um,

262
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:48,760
and then the Oort cloud.
We just, I don't, you know,

263
00:12:48,761 --> 00:12:52,710
we're never going to get there in anyone's
lifetime. It's just the spaceships.

264
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,940
We'll continue going,
but we are not going to know.

265
00:12:54,970 --> 00:12:57,230
They will run out of battery by
then anyway, so, right. Yeah.

266
00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:01,840
Doing the math on the numbers from your
book. I got that light leaves the sun,

267
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:05,200
it gets to the near edge of the
Kuyper belt in four hours. Okay.

268
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:06,160
So that's the Kuiper belt.

269
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:09,340
It gets to the near edge of the Oort
cloud and something like nine and a half

270
00:13:09,341 --> 00:13:11,110
months. Okay. That's the,

271
00:13:11,111 --> 00:13:12,940
that's the magnitude of the
difference that we're talking.

272
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:16,520
Yep. And then the Oort cloud, it would
take another t as the cross, right?

273
00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:22,410
Yeah, exactly right. Yeah. It's like
from one to three light years distance.

274
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:23,090
Yeah.

275
00:13:23,090 --> 00:13:26,960
Can just space cost speeds. I mean, this
is going to take, um, hundreds of pounds,

276
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:28,670
tens of thousands of
years, I'm guessing. Yes.

277
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:32,200
Right. It's somewhere 40,000
years or something. Something
along those lines. Yeah.

278
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:35,970
Sorry. It's the very far right.
And actually had a reasonable labs,

279
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:38,500
objects of batty bound to our son.

280
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:43,090
They are actually influenced often by in
the galaxy, the passing of other stars,

281
00:13:43,091 --> 00:13:46,040
like they can be knocked out
of the orbit, um, by, you know,

282
00:13:46,041 --> 00:13:50,350
the literally other stars nearby
because the almost closer to other solar

283
00:13:50,351 --> 00:13:51,820
systems or stars then.
Right.

284
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:54,940
Those are the things I was fascinated
when, just a little factoid,

285
00:13:54,941 --> 00:13:56,950
I was fascinated by from
your book that that the,

286
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:58,600
the outer edge of the Oort cloud,

287
00:13:58,601 --> 00:14:01,920
which is around our son is actually
closer to the next star yeah.

288
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:02,980
Than it is to our son.

289
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:05,810
But they are literally within
our sales system. So it's, yeah,

290
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:08,480
it's kind of where you define the
edge of the solar system and there are

291
00:14:08,481 --> 00:14:12,320
different definitions for where it is,
right. When you enter interstellar space,

292
00:14:12,321 --> 00:14:16,700
which is the bit in between the stars.
Um, and so yeah, the voyager missions,

293
00:14:16,701 --> 00:14:20,270
which settled in the 1970s they
are now in interstellar space,

294
00:14:20,271 --> 00:14:24,080
but that just means they are past
the cliff about, right, right. Yeah.

295
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:27,880
Yeah. As long as you're talking about
like awesome little facts from your book.

296
00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:31,780
Um, the, the, at this, this is the
thing that that kind of blew my mind.

297
00:14:31,781 --> 00:14:32,800
The asteroid belt,

298
00:14:32,801 --> 00:14:37,150
all the asteroids from the asteroid belt
put together would have less mass than

299
00:14:37,151 --> 00:14:40,690
Earth's moon. Yeah. Yeah. Which is very
different from your picture of it is,

300
00:14:40,691 --> 00:14:40,901
you know,

301
00:14:40,901 --> 00:14:44,290
you think of the Millennium Falcon
swimming through the asteroid belt in the

302
00:14:44,291 --> 00:14:46,420
asteroids are all kind of like
huge and close together and yeah,

303
00:14:46,421 --> 00:14:47,820
but it's really kind
of Nice guy. Hey, quiet

304
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:49,050
Scott's it out.
And that's a good thing.

305
00:14:49,051 --> 00:14:52,490
Otherwise they would collide more often
and we should have more issues in the

306
00:14:52,491 --> 00:14:54,590
inner solar system with
potentially being hit by one.

307
00:14:54,591 --> 00:14:55,700
So actually it's a good thing that,

308
00:14:55,701 --> 00:14:58,100
that nicely far apart so you
can get through quite easily.

309
00:14:58,101 --> 00:14:58,934
You can find a good route.

310
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:03,380
Well, well that's a, that's a nice
little transition for us. Um, uh,

311
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:07,280
so now that we know that we have a handle
on kind of what all the players are,

312
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:09,920
then comets and asteroids in the solar
system and the media is of course,

313
00:15:09,921 --> 00:15:13,650
once they get here, um, let's talk about
how they're going to kill us. All. Great.

314
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:17,230
Yeah. So, so one of the things that
you talked about in the book is,

315
00:15:17,231 --> 00:15:20,210
is you kind of point out that
comets and asteroids give us,

316
00:15:20,211 --> 00:15:23,670
but they also take it the way that they
might have brought life to earth. Um,

317
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:27,350
but they also, you know, wiped out the
dinosaurs and could do the same to us. Um,

318
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:27,720
I'm,

319
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:31,940
I'm a little hesitant to ascribe a
properties like good and evil to inanimate

320
00:15:31,941 --> 00:15:35,180
objects like that. Maybe we should
talk about them and helpful or scary,

321
00:15:35,181 --> 00:15:36,800
but how do you think about them?

322
00:15:36,801 --> 00:15:39,920
Do you think that there are things
that should be revered or feared or

323
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:40,991
so,
I mean,

324
00:15:40,991 --> 00:15:44,080
it was probably no surprise as somebody
who's researched these objects quite a

325
00:15:44,081 --> 00:15:48,390
while that I revere them.
Because one of the things about it is yes,

326
00:15:48,391 --> 00:15:50,190
they do have the potential
to collide with us.

327
00:15:50,191 --> 00:15:53,100
And we think we see for about a
hundred years. So probably all of us,

328
00:15:53,101 --> 00:15:55,260
unless you know how to live a
lot longer than a hundred years,

329
00:15:55,261 --> 00:15:56,490
then you're going to be okay.

330
00:15:56,491 --> 00:16:00,510
But the thing is like our descendants
going to be okay and the more we can learn

331
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:01,770
about the subjects now,

332
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:05,550
the better prepared we are to do
something about one of them hitting us.

333
00:16:05,551 --> 00:16:09,120
So if we don't understand our enemy,
then we don't know how to fight it.

334
00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:14,160
So I love these objects because they can
tell us a lot about where we came from,

335
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:17,790
about our past and how everything
started in the solar system. But yeah,

336
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:20,520
they do really have the
potential to cause havoc.

337
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:23,570
Got a large asteroid could hit
us, um, pass that a hundred years.

338
00:16:23,571 --> 00:16:26,580
I mean there's a chance one could
hit us within a hundred years,

339
00:16:26,581 --> 00:16:29,910
but it's very unlikely pass that
we at the moment don't know.

340
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:34,350
It's a kind of a continuously updated
list of potentially hazardous asteroids

341
00:16:34,351 --> 00:16:36,010
and comets,
which you know,

342
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:40,170
astronomy's or studying and they need
to understand better how they move in on

343
00:16:40,171 --> 00:16:41,460
that orbits and what you know,

344
00:16:41,461 --> 00:16:44,430
the next orbit of the sun is going to
do and if they're going to be altered by

345
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:46,440
passing Jupiter in the
future or something.

346
00:16:46,441 --> 00:16:50,250
So we need to understand exactly what
they're doing, how they're spinning,

347
00:16:50,251 --> 00:16:52,440
and then we need to know what they're
made of because if we don't know what

348
00:16:52,441 --> 00:16:55,920
they're made of,
well some ideas like Armageddon,

349
00:16:55,921 --> 00:16:57,690
if you've seen the Hollywood movie right,

350
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:02,370
they actually go and detonate
some explosive inside the
asteroid to blow it up.

351
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,050
Well,
it depends what you're dealing with.

352
00:17:04,051 --> 00:17:06,540
If this asteroid has made a
pure metal that might not work,

353
00:17:06,541 --> 00:17:09,230
you might not even be able to
drill into the thing too to put an,

354
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:13,470
to put some exclusive with inside it.
But if we talk about a comment well made,

355
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:17,200
if it's coming towards earth, it might
just explode on atmospheric entry anyway.

356
00:17:17,201 --> 00:17:19,230
So it's kind of like,
okay,

357
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:23,160
we need to know what we're dealing with
if we want to go and deflect or destroy

358
00:17:23,161 --> 00:17:24,300
one before it gets here.

359
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:27,040
Right. And you talked about this
some in the book that that, uh,

360
00:17:27,070 --> 00:17:30,100
even even blowing up the asteroid might
not be good because now you have a whole

361
00:17:30,101 --> 00:17:32,880
bunch of asteroids that are going to
kill you instead of one big Astoria.

362
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:35,830
Exactly.
And I think one of the things is like the,

363
00:17:36,170 --> 00:17:38,840
the more advanced notice we get,
the better.

364
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:42,640
So if we can see that an object
is heading for us and it's large,

365
00:17:42,641 --> 00:17:46,220
say a kilometer or so,
um, and it's 10 years out,

366
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:48,080
then we have time to launch a mission.

367
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:50,670
This is why we need to do a bit of work
in advance because of course it's not

368
00:17:50,671 --> 00:17:53,130
that easy to launch a mission
just straight the next day.

369
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:55,890
So we did a few years to figure out
how to launch the mission there.

370
00:17:56,190 --> 00:17:58,770
It'd be great if we had one ready to
go for any of these objects. So sure.

371
00:17:58,830 --> 00:18:02,130
What we're currently working on
in planetary defense. Um, it's a,

372
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:06,240
it's a big topic at the moment and
research and governments are actually

373
00:18:06,241 --> 00:18:08,760
interested in this,
which is great because we need them to be,

374
00:18:08,761 --> 00:18:12,810
to support the research community launch
mission. Basically, the longer you have,

375
00:18:12,811 --> 00:18:15,690
the better. If you want to deflect
something and it's way off,

376
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,560
it's going to be a smaller
nudge to deflect it.

377
00:18:17,561 --> 00:18:18,810
If you just want to push it out the way,

378
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:20,610
then if it's right next to earth already,

379
00:18:20,611 --> 00:18:24,390
you're going to have to deflect a
long way for, it's a mess. Ideally,

380
00:18:24,391 --> 00:18:27,020
we'd want it to deflect them. We just
want to put it on a different course.

381
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:29,250
And this is our planet and we don't
care if it hits another planet,

382
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:32,520
but we want to protect our
own planet. Um, we could,

383
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,980
if we're stuck and we
don't have much notice,

384
00:18:34,981 --> 00:18:38,010
we could explode it in some way
if we can find a way. Of course,

385
00:18:38,011 --> 00:18:39,750
he might need to use nuclear weapons,

386
00:18:39,751 --> 00:18:43,590
which is not going to be fun if you're
going to get the reign of this nuclear

387
00:18:43,591 --> 00:18:45,250
weapon falling down on the planet.
But

388
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:47,170
possibly in violation of treaties?

389
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:50,810
I think if we, yeah, I think so.

390
00:18:50,811 --> 00:18:54,050
I think Nico weapons aren't allowed to
be used in spaces like in a bad way.

391
00:18:54,051 --> 00:18:57,260
So I think everyone was saving our planet
then we'd probably let it go and maybe

392
00:18:57,261 --> 00:19:00,020
some nuclear fallout wouldn't be as
bad as just being hit by an asteroid.

393
00:19:00,021 --> 00:19:02,450
So we'd, we might allow
it, but you know it,

394
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:04,940
it sounds like science fiction
and it is science fiction,

395
00:19:04,941 --> 00:19:06,470
but it's also now turning into reality.

396
00:19:06,471 --> 00:19:08,060
These are really kind of
what we're thinking of.

397
00:19:08,061 --> 00:19:10,970
If there's other crazier ideas that
we don't have to explain these things,

398
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:14,390
there's other ideas that we can
spray paint one side of this object.

399
00:19:14,391 --> 00:19:18,080
So generally these objects are very dark
and as they go by it, something else,

400
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:21,310
heat it up. Now if you can
change one side of the asteroid,

401
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:23,240
if you could spray paint
it white or metallic,

402
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:27,030
it's going to heat up differently as it
goes near to the sun and it will start

403
00:19:27,031 --> 00:19:28,910
spinning differently.
And if it spins differently,

404
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:32,270
it'll change is all bit gradually.
So these are very gentle techniques.

405
00:19:32,271 --> 00:19:34,310
It sounds a bit mad trying
to spray paint in space,

406
00:19:34,311 --> 00:19:37,040
but this is literally one of one of
the things we could do or cover it with

407
00:19:37,041 --> 00:19:40,910
something to kind of change.
It's how it reacts to the Sun's heat.

408
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:44,770
I never saw the movie Armageddon, but I,
I, I gathered what it's about. Is it yet?

409
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:45,713
I haven't seen it.

410
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:49,320
I gather what it's about is they
sent like basically miners to space

411
00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:54,140
Ben AFLAC where you split us
up there, right. Oil minus.
Yeah. They would drill it,

412
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:56,570
but so it, it never occurred to
me like I, I kind of get that,

413
00:19:56,571 --> 00:19:58,770
but it had never occurred to me that
maybe what you won't want to sentence

414
00:19:58,790 --> 00:20:02,940
taggers that could yellow spray paint
the side, right? Yeah, they would,

415
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:04,320
they would put a nice mural on the side.

416
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:07,690
It would look pretty as it
passed us by safely. I mean,

417
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:10,510
every hour to work on that. That's
your next book. Should do that.

418
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:14,320
I can be the novel. Right? Yeah. Um,

419
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:17,710
but yeah, I mean, of course we're
not actually going to send people up.

420
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:20,760
In reality what's going to happen is that
we use robots and in space, of course,

421
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:23,590
all the time we use robots just
because they're more expendable.

422
00:20:23,591 --> 00:20:25,330
We don't really care if
we killed the robots.

423
00:20:25,331 --> 00:20:28,300
We care because they cost a lot and a
lot of people's careers going into making

424
00:20:28,301 --> 00:20:32,230
them something else. The legs really fall,
fall in love with it. Yeah. Don't we all,

425
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:33,880
but yeah,
it's not human.

426
00:20:33,881 --> 00:20:37,930
So there's this big issues of
sending humans into space and yeah,

427
00:20:37,931 --> 00:20:39,850
if we're going to send them
to landing on an asteroid,

428
00:20:39,851 --> 00:20:42,970
well asteroids don't have an awful lot
of gravity cause they're small objects,

429
00:20:42,971 --> 00:20:46,060
so they're going to have to be tethered
on, um, uh, can't remember what they did.

430
00:20:46,061 --> 00:20:49,280
And I'm forgetting if, if
they would, I think it was
just roaming about freely. Um,

431
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,190
they would probably a float
off into space, you know,

432
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:54,070
so it's not easy to send
humans to these objects.

433
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:56,950
I'm sure it will happen in the
future way into the future.

434
00:20:56,951 --> 00:21:01,010
But for now it will be robots, which
again is not easy because as you know,

435
00:21:01,011 --> 00:21:01,844
you're trying to run a,

436
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:05,710
a robot from earth and millions
of miles away has its issues.

437
00:21:05,711 --> 00:21:09,300
Communication Times a tricky cause. It
takes a long time to communicate, right?

438
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:10,803
Things go wrong.

439
00:21:10,810 --> 00:21:14,320
Like I run a lab instrument for many years
and I could be in that tinkering with

440
00:21:14,321 --> 00:21:16,270
it and something went wrong.
I could change things,

441
00:21:16,271 --> 00:21:19,720
but if that instrument is way off on an
asteroid, there's nothing you can do.

442
00:21:19,721 --> 00:21:23,650
If it breaks, there's not ran off like you
can do. So yeah, there's lots of issues.

443
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:27,680
So, but we have actually sent a
space missions to these objects to,

444
00:21:27,681 --> 00:21:31,970
to comets and asteroids before.
And uh, it was, it was, uh, uh,

445
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:32,781
I would say it was,

446
00:21:32,781 --> 00:21:35,870
it was pretty evident from reading your
book that you're a big fan of both the

447
00:21:35,871 --> 00:21:37,120
startups and Rosetta missions.

448
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:38,660
I am, yeah. They got a chat to me.

449
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:42,660
Speaking of, speaking of landing something
on a, on a, uh, one of those objects,

450
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:47,050
Rosetta actually did that. Yeah. Tell us
a little bit about those missions. Yes.

451
00:21:47,130 --> 00:21:50,040
Sorry. I mean, the NASA
stardust mission was like,

452
00:21:50,041 --> 00:21:51,780
it had happened at head to board at SOM,

453
00:21:51,781 --> 00:21:55,630
pulls back as I was starting my career
in this and this area of science. Um,

454
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:57,800
so the NASA status was
really groundbreaking.

455
00:21:57,810 --> 00:22:01,500
It was actually quite a cheap mission
and it flew to comment built to,

456
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,750
and it wanted to bring a sample back,

457
00:22:03,751 --> 00:22:07,080
but it didn't have enough money to land
on this subject and come back from it.

458
00:22:07,081 --> 00:22:09,170
So they flew through the
tail of the comments.

459
00:22:09,171 --> 00:22:11,880
So I had mentioned that comments
have a lot of ice and dust in them,

460
00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:15,180
and as they go by the sun, this
material gets heated up. So sure enough,

461
00:22:15,181 --> 00:22:17,250
the ice streams off the
comment takes dust with it.

462
00:22:17,550 --> 00:22:18,750
And that's what the thesis of the tail,

463
00:22:18,751 --> 00:22:20,520
when you get the famous
comments that you see,

464
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:24,840
all the beautiful images of that tale of
material is literally the gas and dust

465
00:22:24,841 --> 00:22:26,610
coming off of that comment.
Um,

466
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:29,280
and so what they did was just flew
through the tail of this comment and

467
00:22:29,281 --> 00:22:31,860
literally just got impacting
particles on this collector.

468
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:35,220
And that was their comment samples and
they closed up that it'll collector and

469
00:22:35,221 --> 00:22:38,010
jettison it back to earth and the
rest of space cock carried on.

470
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:40,950
And we had these samples back in 2006.
Um,

471
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:44,670
and they will often ask sample it real
samples of a comment because it's hard to

472
00:22:44,671 --> 00:22:47,250
know if we've got any niche rights of
comments because as I said earlier,

473
00:22:47,251 --> 00:22:50,610
they probably explode as they enter
the atmosphere. So it's hard to know.

474
00:22:50,611 --> 00:22:52,640
We've definitely got one on earth.
Um,

475
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:57,270
so this was a real groundbreaking mission
and then it also really turn the books

476
00:22:57,271 --> 00:22:57,630
on what,

477
00:22:57,630 --> 00:23:01,460
how we thought comments formed and what
it showed us was that actually this,

478
00:23:01,530 --> 00:23:03,510
we know it's a comment,
it behaves like a comment.

479
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:07,860
We know it's all bad that it comes from
um, you know, from the Kuiper belt.

480
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:11,820
And then what we find is that actually
it doesn't look like a comment when we

481
00:23:11,821 --> 00:23:14,550
look at the rocks within it,
right? They look like an asteroid.

482
00:23:14,730 --> 00:23:17,850
So it doesn't sound very exciting
to be like, hold on a minute.

483
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:20,580
This thing formed way out in
the outer solar system yet.

484
00:23:20,581 --> 00:23:23,970
It's got components within it that
look exactly like the planets that look

485
00:23:23,971 --> 00:23:26,970
exactly like the building blocks of the
planets that form very close to the sun.

486
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:30,660
So how do we get ice and hot
material contained within one object?

487
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:34,170
So this was why everything got blown
apart at this stage. And the scientists,

488
00:23:34,171 --> 00:23:35,460
you know,
and they're still working on it.

489
00:23:35,461 --> 00:23:38,280
We're still trying to understand how we
get hot material from the inner solar

490
00:23:38,281 --> 00:23:41,050
system out to the comet forming region,
um,

491
00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:44,550
to form a comment that then is covered
in ice and dust and all the normal stuff

492
00:23:44,551 --> 00:23:48,230
of the we it to contain. Um, and, and
there's lots of different theories,

493
00:23:48,231 --> 00:23:51,620
but that is still an ongoing
area that we need to understand.

494
00:23:51,621 --> 00:23:56,450
So we know that the story is not as simple
as it could be as we'd like it to be,

495
00:23:56,451 --> 00:23:58,880
as,
as the textbooks would have us believe

496
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:00,550
before we move on to said it,

497
00:24:00,551 --> 00:24:02,620
start us to also brought us back
in addition to bring us back.

498
00:24:02,621 --> 00:24:04,960
The first sample from a comment
brought us back samples of interstellar

499
00:24:04,961 --> 00:24:07,690
protocols, right? It did. Yeah.
The detector around the other way.

500
00:24:07,691 --> 00:24:09,310
And exactly what a few of those as well.

501
00:24:09,550 --> 00:24:12,550
Yeah. Basically we have particles
from interstellar space,

502
00:24:12,551 --> 00:24:15,970
which is the space around all the
stars and the solar system. Um,

503
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:20,110
and these particles are traveling
sexually fast. Um, and they,

504
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:23,590
we haven't really been up to sample
them before, but so this, um, kind of,

505
00:24:23,591 --> 00:24:25,360
it was called like a tennis
racket style collector.

506
00:24:25,361 --> 00:24:28,750
We kind of just came up out
of the spacecraft once I
collect a comment particles

507
00:24:28,990 --> 00:24:32,140
and then the backside collected
interstellar particles and they're tiny.

508
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:36,040
They're like the best so tiny that we
can't like the Colette particles or small,

509
00:24:36,041 --> 00:24:39,880
I'm saying like probably a maximum of
like the width of a human hair would be

510
00:24:39,881 --> 00:24:42,220
the largest particles we
collected if that. Um,

511
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:44,530
the interstellar particles are
10 times smaller than that.

512
00:24:44,531 --> 00:24:48,130
So they're very hard to
see on the collector and
they're very hard to analyze.

513
00:24:48,131 --> 00:24:51,050
But like there wasn't a
whole instrument built, um,

514
00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:54,400
somewhere in la or somewhere
in California. Can't remember
which, uh, university,

515
00:24:54,401 --> 00:24:58,240
it's that, but they basically made a
whole instruments to measure these, these,

516
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:02,740
these particles because we can sample
then our galaxy because we have no other

517
00:25:02,741 --> 00:25:04,810
way. We haven't been able
to go out to our galaxy,

518
00:25:04,811 --> 00:25:08,260
but these particles come to us so we can
actually start to understand what our

519
00:25:08,261 --> 00:25:12,310
galaxy looks like and what it's made of,
which is fascinating. So yeah, it was,

520
00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:14,890
you know, just did so much that
mission. It was fascinating.

521
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:18,470
There were, there were some other
really interesting things in there. You,

522
00:25:18,471 --> 00:25:22,160
you go into it a lot of detail
about exactly how the, the,

523
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:24,760
we're able to get some of those,
those samples out and so on. But um,

524
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:26,270
we might want to come back to that.

525
00:25:26,271 --> 00:25:29,110
But I did want to also give you a chance
to talk about Rosetta as well. Yeah.

526
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:31,050
Fascinating.
Such a great mission.

527
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:33,100
So I was just really
well placed on the sound.

528
00:25:33,101 --> 00:25:36,160
We're really lucky to be where I was
working when there was that commission.

529
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,100
Little is ongoing now.

530
00:25:37,101 --> 00:25:39,950
I have to say I wasn't in it from the
beginning cause it took 20 years to plan

531
00:25:39,951 --> 00:25:42,190
this mission. In fact, I think
when it was originally implant,

532
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:44,750
I was probably still in
school. Um, like you know,

533
00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:47,480
primary kind of school very early.
Um,

534
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:51,170
and then it took a long time to
build the mission and then, um,

535
00:25:51,171 --> 00:25:54,550
it took 10 years for it to actually
from launch to get to it's comments.

536
00:25:54,551 --> 00:25:58,970
So it had this massive journey in the
solar system to get to catch up with this

537
00:25:58,971 --> 00:26:03,250
comment. So there's comment, um, call
it 67 peach therea mafia, Russell Manco.

538
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:04,350
Yeah.

539
00:26:04,350 --> 00:26:07,340
Can't do that. I just like everybody
else. I just say Cherry Jerry. Oh, oh

540
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:11,420
yeah. You can say CG or does
nps a long name. Um, but uh,

541
00:26:11,421 --> 00:26:14,510
it was traveling into the inner solar
system and the idea was that they launched

542
00:26:14,511 --> 00:26:17,750
and had to decent gravitational slingshots
of different planets to catch up with

543
00:26:17,751 --> 00:26:21,020
it. Again, enough speed cause you can't
just launch and go directly to a comment.

544
00:26:21,021 --> 00:26:24,770
That's literally not how it works.
So we have to just catch up with it.

545
00:26:24,771 --> 00:26:27,500
So it got onto an orbit eventually
is catch up with the comment,

546
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:31,310
came up on it from behind and then an
incident orbit around this thing that

547
00:26:31,311 --> 00:26:34,620
we've never done this before. So you know,
start that just flew through the tail.

548
00:26:34,790 --> 00:26:38,170
Um, but [inaudible] was just amazing.
It got to the comment and it,

549
00:26:38,210 --> 00:26:39,680
it basically had to do a powered,

550
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:42,170
it couldn't get into orbit around
it cause the subject small,

551
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:45,960
it wasn't a real obit, but she's
with gravity, how it fly around it.

552
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:50,070
So these people doing this engineering
and all the science for this mission and

553
00:26:50,071 --> 00:26:52,380
it just,
I just am amazed by how they did this,

554
00:26:52,381 --> 00:26:55,200
but they didn't even know what this
object look like before we got there.

555
00:26:55,350 --> 00:26:58,380
We had no idea of its
shape or its exact size.

556
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:01,860
We were expecting it to be sort of
round because we always kind of envisage

557
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:03,930
these objects to be sort of round.
Um,

558
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:06,180
and we got there and it turned
out to be like a rubber ducky.

559
00:27:06,290 --> 00:27:09,090
Anything that says like it
caught everyone's attention
in the media quite a lot

560
00:27:09,091 --> 00:27:10,700
because it literally has,
it looks like a rubber duck.

561
00:27:10,710 --> 00:27:12,850
It's got this head and this body.
Um,

562
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:17,520
and I can't imagine how you figure out
how to fly around that thing without

563
00:27:17,521 --> 00:27:19,050
bumping into it or whatever.

564
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:23,190
But we started to get images back from
this comment and they mapped 100% of the

565
00:27:23,191 --> 00:27:26,220
surface of the comment cause they had
to pick somewhere to put a lambda down.

566
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:27,960
Right. Um, again, they,

567
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:32,010
they built this landed 20 years previous
and they didn't know what they were

568
00:27:32,011 --> 00:27:33,130
going to be landing on.
Um,

569
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:35,730
do you call it candy philosophy
or the stuff you eat at the fair?

570
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:40,860
Kansy okay.
So we call it candy floss.

571
00:27:40,861 --> 00:27:42,570
So one of the scientists
likened it to like,

572
00:27:42,571 --> 00:27:44,940
they didn't know if they were getting my
landing on Candy floss or cotton candy

573
00:27:44,941 --> 00:27:46,830
or cement. You know, they were like,

574
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:50,400
they had no idea for this concrete hard
or very soft and they were going to sink

575
00:27:50,401 --> 00:27:53,890
in. So they had to build a lamb dish
after you just have to build a spacecraft

576
00:27:53,910 --> 00:27:55,830
that's going to land on something
that you don't know what it is.

577
00:27:55,831 --> 00:28:00,800
You have no idea what it is.
Exactly. It's, it's easy. Um, so,

578
00:28:00,810 --> 00:28:03,600
you know, they launch, they
let the little lambs ago, um,

579
00:28:03,601 --> 00:28:07,350
and the lender is called [inaudible]
and it just dropped to the comment.

580
00:28:07,351 --> 00:28:09,060
But again,
remember there's not much gravity.

581
00:28:09,061 --> 00:28:11,010
So the comment is not
attracting that thing to it.

582
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:13,020
The comments still rotating in space.

583
00:28:13,021 --> 00:28:14,910
So they have chosen a landing
spot and they're like, yeah,

584
00:28:14,911 --> 00:28:16,800
we want to add exactly here.
And sure enough,

585
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:20,370
it did initially land exactly where
they wanted it to go on this object.

586
00:28:20,371 --> 00:28:22,350
That's like three by
five kilometers in size.

587
00:28:22,351 --> 00:28:26,570
So it's not big and it all hurtling
towards the sun at the same time. Um,

588
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:28,110
unfortunately some stuff went wrong.

589
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:32,760
One of the harpoons that was meant to
fire when they landed in order to kind of

590
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:34,770
hold it onto the surface
and tether it there,

591
00:28:34,890 --> 00:28:37,050
they already knew when they were
going through their procedures,

592
00:28:37,051 --> 00:28:39,990
before they were going to release,
um, Phil, I that it wasn't working.

593
00:28:39,991 --> 00:28:42,870
So they already thought, okay,
what can we do about this?

594
00:28:42,871 --> 00:28:45,350
There's nothing we can do this, you
know, we have to just go for it.

595
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:48,210
Now we have to test it. So, you
know, they did their job right,

596
00:28:48,211 --> 00:28:51,930
they got exactly where they wanted to,
but the land of bounced,

597
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:54,000
it bounced about
kilometer up into the air.

598
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,480
And other issue is that it could have
just completely left the comment because

599
00:28:57,481 --> 00:29:00,630
it wasn't going to go back. It didn't
bounce quite high enough that it left.

600
00:29:00,631 --> 00:29:03,030
So it went back down again. Um, and,

601
00:29:03,090 --> 00:29:06,120
and it took a few hours and then it
landed again and had another balance.

602
00:29:06,150 --> 00:29:07,650
So it's kind of hilarious.

603
00:29:07,651 --> 00:29:10,110
It did the kind of three landings and
space and they were already planning to do

604
00:29:10,111 --> 00:29:12,790
one. Unfortunately where it ended up, um,

605
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:16,560
was not the optimal position
for the solar panels.

606
00:29:16,561 --> 00:29:18,460
So it was kind of under a slight cliff.

607
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:21,000
But we then learned that comments
have cliffs on them and you know,

608
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:25,140
overhanging sections. It's Kinda
crazy. Um, and but it did run,

609
00:29:25,141 --> 00:29:28,770
it run its primary science sequence
when it got initially to the comment.

610
00:29:29,190 --> 00:29:33,060
So we actually ended up sampling some
of the comic gasses and some of the dust

611
00:29:33,061 --> 00:29:35,010
that was, um, from the
initial landing site.

612
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:38,370
And then it's in for the science later on.
So we still learned an awful lot.

613
00:29:38,371 --> 00:29:41,320
So it kind of seems like a failure,
but it wasn't a failure all,

614
00:29:41,321 --> 00:29:45,790
it's not at all this huge amount of
science done. Um, and, and we had, um,

615
00:29:45,791 --> 00:29:48,760
when I was working at open university and,
and the UK,

616
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:50,530
we had one of the
instruments on the lander,

617
00:29:50,531 --> 00:29:54,290
so we had a mass spectrometer that can
measure some of the components from,

618
00:29:54,310 --> 00:29:56,770
from the gasses and there.
So we've got to learn what was,

619
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:57,520
what was on the comment.

620
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,560
That's right. And to your
surprise, you got, you got that,

621
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:03,250
you got samples from like three places
exactly. Work for this guy, Ray Arvidson,

622
00:30:03,251 --> 00:30:07,840
great guy who, who would say all the
time, there's no bad data. Um, and so you,

623
00:30:07,841 --> 00:30:08,111
you know,

624
00:30:08,111 --> 00:30:10,750
just because you didn't get the exact
day that you plan to get doesn't mean you

625
00:30:10,751 --> 00:30:12,850
didn't get some great stuff. We've
got the stuff from, you know,

626
00:30:12,851 --> 00:30:14,090
because it was bouncing.
You got it.

627
00:30:14,410 --> 00:30:17,450
We actually got multiple locations and
then we still have the old button that

628
00:30:17,451 --> 00:30:21,550
was, you know, still orbiting around or
flying around the comment at the time. Um,

629
00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:22,520
and doing its own work.

630
00:30:22,521 --> 00:30:25,790
It was measuring lots of other experiments
and dangles over of the work and

631
00:30:25,791 --> 00:30:28,440
measuring dust coming off and
collecting that and looking at the,

632
00:30:28,590 --> 00:30:31,880
the plasma environment, how the,
how the comment reacts to the Sun,

633
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:33,680
which is very important because we didn't,

634
00:30:33,770 --> 00:30:36,710
we don't really know how comments react
to the someone we know that they get

635
00:30:36,711 --> 00:30:39,740
heated up and mixed girl
comes off. Um, but we,

636
00:30:39,770 --> 00:30:43,280
we found out that actually every time
this comment 67 p went by the sun,

637
00:30:43,281 --> 00:30:45,530
it loses about a meter of
material off its surface.

638
00:30:45,531 --> 00:30:49,910
So it gets smaller and smaller because
those volatile isis and everything get

639
00:30:49,911 --> 00:30:54,270
heated up and blown off the comment.
Then that dust that is sitting above it,

640
00:30:54,271 --> 00:30:57,800
that's that kind of dehydrated
layer on top and it will comes off.

641
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:00,800
So you lose a huge amount of material.
And so it's a very active environment.

642
00:31:00,801 --> 00:31:04,100
A comment is constantly changing and
you go, oh yeah, that these old objects.

643
00:31:04,101 --> 00:31:06,890
And they, they preserved the very
old history of our solar system.

644
00:31:06,891 --> 00:31:10,290
But actually if they come by the sun,
that changing all the time. And, um,

645
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:11,690
and we see that they have seasons.

646
00:31:11,691 --> 00:31:14,630
We notice that the comment had
different seasons on it depending on,

647
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:17,570
on where you were on the comment and
where it was in relation to the sun.

648
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:21,650
So in that wow moves material around
the comic, we see movement of, you know,

649
00:31:21,651 --> 00:31:24,370
like active processes like you
would see on a planet. It's crazy.

650
00:31:24,630 --> 00:31:29,190
Yeah. That's amazing. I, I hadn't heard
that before. That's really cool. Um, uh,

651
00:31:29,191 --> 00:31:31,020
so long as we're talking
about these space missions,

652
00:31:31,021 --> 00:31:33,760
I just want to give a quick shout
out to the dawn mission, um,

653
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:38,280
which after 11 years of exploring,
uh, the asteroids, Vesta and Ceres is,

654
00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:42,060
um, uh, is, is running out of maneuvering
fuels kind of middle of next month.

655
00:31:42,390 --> 00:31:45,850
And so it's going to say goodbye to us,
but, uh, but just a little shout out to,

656
00:31:45,851 --> 00:31:50,330
to dawn for a long end and
a honorable mission, um, uh,

657
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,710
increasing our understanding of the very
objects that we're talking about here.

658
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:57,480
Yeah. Um, so, uh, uh, uh, so, uh,

659
00:31:57,870 --> 00:32:02,600
uh, uh, you were talking about, uh, the,

660
00:32:02,601 --> 00:32:04,110
the, we, we talked about this earlier,

661
00:32:04,111 --> 00:32:06,600
that there wasn't necessarily a sharp
distinction between these asteroids and

662
00:32:06,601 --> 00:32:06,871
comets.

663
00:32:06,871 --> 00:32:10,710
And so now that we've had these missions
to kind of look at asteroids close up

664
00:32:10,711 --> 00:32:11,760
and look at comments close out,

665
00:32:11,761 --> 00:32:16,170
we're kind of learning more about how
like there isn't asteroids and comets,

666
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:19,500
there's more like kind of attractors in,
in the space where there's,

667
00:32:19,501 --> 00:32:21,690
there's things that we would constantly
call asteroids and things we would

668
00:32:21,691 --> 00:32:25,050
constantly call comments,
but also a lot of things kind
of in between. Yeah. Um, so,

669
00:32:25,051 --> 00:32:27,690
so what did we learn from these missions
that kind of helps us understand that

670
00:32:27,691 --> 00:32:28,710
continuum a little better?

671
00:32:28,930 --> 00:32:31,900
So I think we've,
we've learned that for me,

672
00:32:31,901 --> 00:32:34,690
I think what I've learned is that
almost doesn't matter the, okay,

673
00:32:34,691 --> 00:32:37,180
so we have objects that said at
either end of this continuum,

674
00:32:37,510 --> 00:32:39,890
but if we want to study also the system,

675
00:32:39,891 --> 00:32:41,780
it really doesn't matter which
ones we studied too much.

676
00:32:41,781 --> 00:32:45,620
And the ones in the middle of probably
the most fascinating because they contain

677
00:32:45,621 --> 00:32:48,690
the primitive materials. So the ones
that contain a lot of carbon, um,

678
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:52,340
and a lot of organic matter and the
ice is not, you know, is important.

679
00:32:52,341 --> 00:32:56,210
But actually understanding the dust that
came from this beginning of the solar

680
00:32:56,211 --> 00:32:57,830
system is great and the organic matter.

681
00:32:57,831 --> 00:33:01,070
And so the next few missions that are
going to study these objects are both

682
00:33:01,071 --> 00:33:03,560
going to asteroids. So
we've got, uh, Cyrus racks,

683
00:33:03,561 --> 00:33:06,500
which is a NASA mission and there's a
Japanese mission could high booster too.

684
00:33:06,650 --> 00:33:08,870
They did Hibu so one already
and that reflected some,

685
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:11,600
some sample and brought that
back. Um, and so we've had,

686
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:14,690
it didn't go completely successfully,
so they're taking another try.

687
00:33:14,691 --> 00:33:15,980
I'm going to do it perfectly this time.

688
00:33:16,250 --> 00:33:19,670
But these two missions have arrived
at their asteroids and they're both

689
00:33:19,850 --> 00:33:23,390
basically primitive asteroids.
So they're almost, they're not,

690
00:33:23,391 --> 00:33:25,100
they're not comment too,
like there's still asteroids,

691
00:33:25,101 --> 00:33:27,020
but they have a lot of
primitive material in,

692
00:33:27,021 --> 00:33:30,050
so we can try and understand these
kinds of beginnings of the solar system.

693
00:33:30,290 --> 00:33:32,660
So they're both going to
be bringing samples back.

694
00:33:32,690 --> 00:33:35,690
I've forgotten right now what
dates we're talking about,

695
00:33:35,691 --> 00:33:39,230
but it's kind of within five years.
I think, or something like that.

696
00:33:39,231 --> 00:33:40,310
We'll be returning materials.

697
00:33:40,311 --> 00:33:43,370
So they've started their mapping phase
of these objects and they're going to be

698
00:33:43,371 --> 00:33:46,060
looking where they're going to put
their lenders down and sampling.

699
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:48,080
But it's proper science fiction stuff.
I love it.

700
00:33:48,081 --> 00:33:50,060
It's just fascinating
that they can do this.

701
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:54,190
We're going to the solar system and
like going to visit comets and asteroids

702
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:57,370
where they live in like bringing
stuff back there. Yeah, that's,

703
00:33:57,380 --> 00:34:01,490
that's really amazing stuff. Um, so, uh,
so we talked a little about, uh, you know,

704
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:05,360
how they're going to kill us all and uh,
um, and uh, and what we would do about it.

705
00:34:05,361 --> 00:34:08,360
So you talked about kind of like spray
painting in a asteroids and things like

706
00:34:08,361 --> 00:34:09,480
that.
Um,

707
00:34:09,530 --> 00:34:14,530
one of the techniques I had not heard
about before before reading your book was

708
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:19,290
a gravity tugs, which is
another interesting way of
diverting asteroids or, or,

709
00:34:19,350 --> 00:34:21,290
or comments off their, uh, uh, path.

710
00:34:21,291 --> 00:34:24,080
And it's nice because it works
with unconsolidated things as well.

711
00:34:24,250 --> 00:34:25,380
I want to explain how gravity,

712
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:29,230
okay, so some of these objects,
even the asteroids, like I said,

713
00:34:29,231 --> 00:34:31,900
the comments were not very
well consolidate and not
very well held together

714
00:34:31,901 --> 00:34:34,640
because this is a scoop of
cloud kind of thing. Um,

715
00:34:34,870 --> 00:34:37,910
and some of the asteroids on the
other hand, also a unconsolidated,

716
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:39,520
they might be made of rocky material,

717
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:42,710
but imagine just getting like a load of
big pebbles and cause kind of sticking

718
00:34:42,770 --> 00:34:46,600
together and they sort of
held there because it was a
bit of gravity and there's

719
00:34:46,601 --> 00:34:49,630
nothing really act on them in space that
would mean that they wouldn't just all

720
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:52,880
fall apart, but they, so they're
sort of loosely bound together. Um,

721
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:56,050
these objects are particularly
dangerous because they're hard to move.

722
00:34:56,051 --> 00:34:59,140
If you want to hit them with something,
they'd probably just going to break up.

723
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:01,090
So we have to be very gentle with them.

724
00:35:01,091 --> 00:35:04,420
If we know one of these objects
is heading towards us, um,

725
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:07,720
it's hard to know how they're going
to behave when they come through the

726
00:35:07,721 --> 00:35:08,720
atmosphere.
Um,

727
00:35:08,730 --> 00:35:12,390
so the gravity tractor thing is almost
just taking a spacecraft up and,

728
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:16,760
and using thrusters on one site
to sort of gently nudge and,

729
00:35:16,790 --> 00:35:21,730
and basically it's the attraction between
that rubble pile and that spacecraft,

730
00:35:21,790 --> 00:35:24,760
which isn't very much,
but if you've got enough advance warning,

731
00:35:24,761 --> 00:35:28,330
you start doing that little playing
game and like nudging it back and forth

732
00:35:28,750 --> 00:35:30,850
early enough,
then it will change it's orbit.

733
00:35:30,851 --> 00:35:34,210
So essentially you just kind of want to
nudge it very gently and it's just that

734
00:35:34,211 --> 00:35:36,070
gravitational attraction
between the two objects,

735
00:35:36,071 --> 00:35:39,900
which obviously happens even if they're
small. Um, there is still something there.

736
00:35:39,901 --> 00:35:44,160
So that would be very useful if it
were a rubble pile style asteroid.

737
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:45,630
I could work with other ones,

738
00:35:45,631 --> 00:35:50,520
but I think that's probably the safest way
to move one of those maybe. Yeah. This,

739
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:51,230
yeah.

740
00:35:51,230 --> 00:35:55,070
More research needed, right? Yeah.
Yeah, yeah. Um, and, and that's not,

741
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:57,540
that's something we haven't done
before. We actually have fired a, uh,

742
00:35:57,650 --> 00:36:00,710
a bullet basically deep place
one. Right. Fired a bullet into,

743
00:36:00,711 --> 00:36:03,140
into the side of a comment. We haven't
tried these other techniques at all.

744
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:06,600
Yeah. Deeds all kind of theoretical.
It a mission called deep impact,

745
00:36:06,601 --> 00:36:09,880
which don't made a deep impact.
And that was confusing my bit,

746
00:36:09,890 --> 00:36:10,723
cause my editor was like,

747
00:36:10,750 --> 00:36:13,500
you've got a mission called him fat was
there's also Hollywood musical director

748
00:36:13,530 --> 00:36:15,680
impacts. And I was like,
yeah, that's complicated. Um,

749
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:18,090
so I think I ended up taking
out all the references,

750
00:36:18,270 --> 00:36:22,940
the movie version called Armageddon. Yes.
That would be good. Is it? Right. So yeah,

751
00:36:22,950 --> 00:36:26,340
this mission actually, um,
basically pushed a boulder,

752
00:36:26,341 --> 00:36:30,180
I fired a boulder into the side
of this comment to see wow.

753
00:36:30,181 --> 00:36:32,330
Basically to see what would
happen because it's fun. Um,

754
00:36:32,550 --> 00:36:37,280
but also to excavate a hole, um, so that
we could see inside the comment. Um,

755
00:36:37,470 --> 00:36:41,130
it was kind of what I'm a little bit
wrong because they created so much dust

756
00:36:41,131 --> 00:36:42,230
from this area,
you know,

757
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:46,680
impacts that the spacecraft couldn't see
anything cause it was just so much dust

758
00:36:46,681 --> 00:36:49,440
everywhere. But like I actually, the
stardust mission and when it carried on,

759
00:36:49,441 --> 00:36:51,570
when it's had to call it
samples and some of those back,

760
00:36:51,571 --> 00:36:55,790
the status next mission had carried on.
Um, and it, it was managed to image, um,

761
00:36:55,820 --> 00:36:57,420
that whole in that
crater that was created.

762
00:36:57,421 --> 00:36:59,880
So we got to see processes
happening and again,

763
00:36:59,881 --> 00:37:03,650
they saw changes happening over time in
that crater they created. So you see,

764
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:06,360
we've got this kind of active
comic thing again, um, which is,

765
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:09,690
which is really cool. So yes, it's
kind of one space mission did it.

766
00:37:09,691 --> 00:37:12,270
And then we came back and had
another look, so. Right, right.

767
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:14,090
Um, so, uh,

768
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:17,240
we're just about 40 minutes
here and probably about
time to start kind of mixing

769
00:37:17,241 --> 00:37:18,630
it, some audience questions. Um,

770
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:22,700
while we're kind of finding the first
victim and giving them the mic. Um,

771
00:37:22,730 --> 00:37:24,590
one of the,
one of the major,

772
00:37:24,591 --> 00:37:29,240
another major topic in your book was
about mining asteroids and comets. Um, uh,

773
00:37:29,241 --> 00:37:30,000
so that the,

774
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,270
so they actually contain material that
would be useful to us on earth. Um,

775
00:37:33,390 --> 00:37:36,410
it's not just organics but,
but also Nicole and uh, uh,

776
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:38,180
platinum and things like that.
Um,

777
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:41,010
you want to talk a little bit about kind
of mining techniques and kind of what

778
00:37:41,011 --> 00:37:41,950
the state of the art there is.
Yeah.

779
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:44,670
So, of course, again, it sounds
like science fiction, it's like,

780
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:48,480
do we really need to mine in space? But
you know, those companies, a lot of them,

781
00:37:48,510 --> 00:37:51,380
you know, a lot of stuff going on in
California where we want to, you know,

782
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:53,780
that's how she companies investing
in this. Trying to think, right?

783
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:57,500
Can we go my niece objects, we could
mind the moon. There's lots of um,

784
00:37:57,540 --> 00:37:59,990
materials on the moon
that would be useful. Um,

785
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:03,510
but equally it might be easier to mine
asteroids, they can be easier to get to.

786
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:04,410
Um,
they don't have gravity,

787
00:38:04,411 --> 00:38:07,920
so easy to get back from if we want to
launch her image it back and they contain

788
00:38:07,921 --> 00:38:11,820
a lot of precious metals. So we all
love our smartphones and everything.

789
00:38:11,910 --> 00:38:14,940
Computers, obviously we're
in Google, so we like, um,

790
00:38:15,090 --> 00:38:17,700
all these materials that
require precious metals.

791
00:38:17,701 --> 00:38:20,520
And if we're going to continue creating
new technologies in the future,

792
00:38:20,521 --> 00:38:24,360
we need to know we've got a reliable
source of things like palladium, platinum,

793
00:38:24,361 --> 00:38:27,510
all these things that are
used in and, um, technology.

794
00:38:28,050 --> 00:38:30,440
We weren't be able to develop new
technologies if we don't know.

795
00:38:30,470 --> 00:38:33,870
We've got a continued source of this
stuff and on earth things like platinum.

796
00:38:33,930 --> 00:38:36,880
While that's expensive, because not much
of it, we find it very hard to mine.

797
00:38:36,881 --> 00:38:40,630
It's very dispersed throughout the crust
of the earth and it's expensive to mine

798
00:38:40,631 --> 00:38:44,620
and often not very good for
the environment to get out.
If we go to an asteroid,

799
00:38:44,621 --> 00:38:45,730
well there's tons of it actually,

800
00:38:45,731 --> 00:38:49,630
there's probably more platinum and some
single asteroids that we've ever mined

801
00:38:49,631 --> 00:38:53,050
on the whole of the planet,
so we run into economical issues.

802
00:38:53,051 --> 00:38:55,960
If we were to mine it and bring it back
to Earth where we'd crash the market and

803
00:38:55,961 --> 00:38:58,900
obviously then it will probably be not
worth having done the whole mining thing.

804
00:38:59,290 --> 00:39:02,440
Maybe we store it like we did with
diamonds and we really sit gradually and

805
00:39:02,441 --> 00:39:04,390
control the market anyway.
I'm not an economist,

806
00:39:04,391 --> 00:39:07,840
but there are issues to doing that.
It may cost trillions of dollars,

807
00:39:07,841 --> 00:39:11,010
literally trillions of dollars to actually
launch the admissions and go and mine

808
00:39:11,011 --> 00:39:14,060
these objects. But the chances
you could actually, you know,

809
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:18,080
there could be worth way more
than that. Um, so there is,

810
00:39:18,130 --> 00:39:21,070
I guess if you have a lot of money and
you think it would be fun to go mine

811
00:39:21,071 --> 00:39:23,880
asteroids, there is the potential
you could make a lot of money. Um,

812
00:39:23,930 --> 00:39:27,550
of course we need reusable rockets because
it's just too expensive other ways we

813
00:39:27,551 --> 00:39:30,400
need to so that obviously a lot of
companies are working on that right now.

814
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:32,410
Being able to cheapen,

815
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:35,980
getting stuff into space cause
it's just massively expensive.

816
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:39,640
But if we can find ways around this and
I think progress is definitely being

817
00:39:39,641 --> 00:39:41,090
made at the moment.
Um,

818
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:44,320
we can get to space cheaply and
we can start to mine new subjects,

819
00:39:44,321 --> 00:39:46,290
but we don't have to bring
all that stuff back to worth.

820
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:49,600
It could be useful in space.
And we want to go to Mars,

821
00:39:49,601 --> 00:39:53,350
we want to venture out further into our
solar system. But we need, first of all,

822
00:39:53,351 --> 00:39:55,570
fuel. It's very expensive
to bring fuel from Earth.

823
00:39:55,571 --> 00:39:58,240
If we want to go out into
the solar system, fine,

824
00:39:58,241 --> 00:39:59,770
we have enough fuel for a little while,

825
00:39:59,771 --> 00:40:02,440
but then if we want to land somewhere
and go and visit somewhere else,

826
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:07,270
we need fuel. And if we launch it from
Earth, it's just very, very expensive.

827
00:40:07,271 --> 00:40:09,970
The more fuel you take,
the more fuel you need to take that fuel.

828
00:40:09,971 --> 00:40:12,700
And there's an exponential
relationship and it just gets crazy.

829
00:40:12,701 --> 00:40:15,610
So if we can find the fuel in space
and sure enough we have water.

830
00:40:15,910 --> 00:40:18,370
If we can split water needs,
get it into hydrogen oxygen,

831
00:40:18,371 --> 00:40:22,600
we can create rocket fuel in space. So
again, it sounds like science fiction,

832
00:40:22,601 --> 00:40:26,980
but we can then also use these objects
to make materials in space three d print.

833
00:40:27,010 --> 00:40:29,380
What we require, instead of
taking a lot of tools from earth,

834
00:40:29,381 --> 00:40:30,191
which we currently do,

835
00:40:30,191 --> 00:40:33,280
if we go to the international space
station or stick everything with us and we

836
00:40:33,281 --> 00:40:37,210
have to launch missions just
to, you know, resupply it.

837
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:39,940
What we wouldn't need to do that. We
could just actually go to three d print.

838
00:40:39,941 --> 00:40:43,210
So they're actually tested three d printer
on the international space station.

839
00:40:44,110 --> 00:40:47,020
And it sounds crazy, but yeah,
that is something we could do.

840
00:40:47,021 --> 00:40:48,070
We just mind the asteroid,

841
00:40:48,071 --> 00:40:51,790
get the materials we need and make the
tools we require in to space. So yeah,

842
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:54,340
it's, it's happening. It seems like,

843
00:40:54,341 --> 00:40:58,150
I think the first steps in as an asteroid
mining are probably going to happen

844
00:40:58,151 --> 00:40:59,350
within the next few decades.

845
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:02,860
The very tentative steps of like
getting their prospecting recently,

846
00:41:02,861 --> 00:41:07,030
seeing what these objects contain and
then figuring out what kind of missions we

847
00:41:07,050 --> 00:41:10,660
required to maybe tug them into an orbit
where they're sort of safe and they're

848
00:41:10,661 --> 00:41:13,630
going to sit there quite happily so
that we can then launch a mission to,

849
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:17,810
to mind them in some way, whether we need
humans. It's unknown at the moment. Um,

850
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:21,550
this is why people talk about needing a
moon base for a lunar base for humans to

851
00:41:21,551 --> 00:41:24,970
live and that they could then
mine from the moon kind of thing.

852
00:41:24,971 --> 00:41:27,640
So it's a lot of unknowns at the moment,

853
00:41:27,641 --> 00:41:30,040
but there's definitely progress
being made. And there are, you know,

854
00:41:30,041 --> 00:41:35,041
there's like the u s has created laws
about now about mining in space and who

855
00:41:35,061 --> 00:41:38,390
owns the, the materials they've
mine. So any US citizen,

856
00:41:38,570 --> 00:41:41,960
theoretically if they mind something
in space, they can own that stuff,

857
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:43,550
which is kind of crazy.

858
00:41:43,580 --> 00:41:45,830
And I don't know what the rest of the
world thinks about this at the moment.

859
00:41:45,831 --> 00:41:48,980
I think Luxembourg are
following very similar laws.

860
00:41:48,981 --> 00:41:51,650
I don't know if they've passed them
yet, but again, Luxembourg is tiny.

861
00:41:51,651 --> 00:41:53,480
I don't know if you've been, but
there's not many people that live there.

862
00:41:53,481 --> 00:41:57,200
So I'm not sure how many people are
in Luxembourg citizens. Um, but yeah,

863
00:41:57,201 --> 00:42:00,230
is that fair? I kind of think,
well, okay, I'm not year since then.

864
00:42:00,231 --> 00:42:01,430
I want to go and mind space,

865
00:42:01,431 --> 00:42:05,930
but I wouldn't be allowed at the moment
to own the space that I, so yeah,

866
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:08,650
a lot of issues, um, and a lot of global

867
00:42:08,750 --> 00:42:10,440
issues.
I think that we need to simply,

868
00:42:10,510 --> 00:42:13,800
they're worth working out because there's
so much, there's so much potential,

869
00:42:13,810 --> 00:42:16,560
so much wealth there. Uh, and,
and it's not just, you know,

870
00:42:16,561 --> 00:42:18,920
wealth in terms of making you rich,
but wealth in terms of, as you said,

871
00:42:18,921 --> 00:42:21,700
things like resources to make smartphones
and stuff like that that play it.

872
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:24,290
You know, I'd never, I'd never really
thought about this before, but uh,

873
00:42:24,291 --> 00:42:27,500
asteroids like have all these resources
that we need and whole lot of fuel that

874
00:42:27,501 --> 00:42:29,330
we can use to help further
explore the solar system.

875
00:42:29,570 --> 00:42:31,270
Asteroids are basically
the convenience stores.

876
00:42:31,610 --> 00:42:34,630
Thanks. Yeah, I kind of said like that the
gas station's right. Yeah, yeah, right.

877
00:42:34,910 --> 00:42:36,930
Kinda pop there and get what
you need and then carry on.

878
00:42:36,931 --> 00:42:39,180
Of course it's not as simple but right.
Yeah,

879
00:42:39,250 --> 00:42:42,060
I kind of liked that idea that
it might happen in the future.

880
00:42:43,420 --> 00:42:45,610
Okay. So I think we have an audience
question. Where did it ready to go?

881
00:42:45,930 --> 00:42:50,700
Yeah, I was going to ask about
asteroid mining. Oh, okay. Okay, good.

882
00:42:50,701 --> 00:42:54,390
I've ruined your question. I'm sorry
Brian. I actually have a question.

883
00:42:54,391 --> 00:42:58,500
Have you ever seen the movie Melancholia?
No, I never heard of it. Check it out.

884
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:04,140
Basically the premise of that movie
is that a large planet sized bodies is

885
00:43:04,141 --> 00:43:08,370
heading towards earth. Um, about the size
of Jupiter. It's huge. Oh my goodness.

886
00:43:08,750 --> 00:43:13,290
Huge, ginormous. The thing is
that the scientific community, uh,

887
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:15,780
sees it well in advance,
like several years.

888
00:43:17,750 --> 00:43:20,310
They're planning it and they're,
they're releasing all this information.

889
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:21,720
I don't want to give away
too much of the movie,

890
00:43:21,721 --> 00:43:24,810
but the premise is that it basically
slingshots around the earth and they think

891
00:43:24,811 --> 00:43:25,531
it's going to pass.

892
00:43:25,531 --> 00:43:29,700
But the slight tug of gravity from the
earth is just enough where it reaches its

893
00:43:29,701 --> 00:43:32,590
apex that it turns around
and comes straight back out.

894
00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:36,190
So my question would be like,
um,

895
00:43:36,690 --> 00:43:40,290
you're kind of doing the
theoretical science around
how we would deflect or move

896
00:43:40,291 --> 00:43:41,790
something that is smaller than earth.

897
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:46,260
Is there any science or theoretical
physics and science going on about how we

898
00:43:46,261 --> 00:43:50,790
would move something that could be much,
much larger?

899
00:43:51,310 --> 00:43:55,550
Well, I think is almost 0%
chance of anything larger
than the earth hitting earth

900
00:43:55,580 --> 00:43:58,970
because the solar system is
settled down now. So like I mean,

901
00:43:59,150 --> 00:44:02,690
4.5 billion years ago, earth was
hit by a Mars size body, we think.

902
00:44:02,691 --> 00:44:03,950
And that's why she formed the moon.

903
00:44:04,220 --> 00:44:07,070
So it collided with the earth and we're
not sure what the details of that,

904
00:44:07,071 --> 00:44:10,070
whether it was a direct impact or
as a kind of a side shot, a bit.

905
00:44:10,071 --> 00:44:14,270
It probably almost certainly vaporize
the earth. And then from that we formed,

906
00:44:14,330 --> 00:44:16,100
we formed our earth
again but also our moon.

907
00:44:16,101 --> 00:44:18,230
So that's the kind of thing
that would happen. You know,

908
00:44:18,231 --> 00:44:21,800
it would just be completely obliterated
if anything larger than Mazda to hit us.

909
00:44:21,801 --> 00:44:25,370
But at this stage the solar
system settled and I mean,

910
00:44:25,430 --> 00:44:28,450
I think it just couldn't happen,
but I mean you'd have to know.

911
00:44:29,260 --> 00:44:32,010
I'm sure it makes for a good movie.
All the, have you seen this Mike,

912
00:44:32,010 --> 00:44:34,010
by the way? This is really
cool. You just toss it around.

913
00:44:34,100 --> 00:44:35,420
I did wonder what it was
when it was hot up here.

914
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:37,230
Yeah.
Uh,

915
00:44:37,330 --> 00:44:41,700
so I was fascinated to hear about
the inner and outer asteroid belt.

916
00:44:41,910 --> 00:44:46,380
Um, and it sounds like they're
materially different. So,

917
00:44:46,420 --> 00:44:49,680
I mean the outer one has a bit more ice
would maybe you'd expect is farther from

918
00:44:49,681 --> 00:44:51,220
the sun,
but uh,

919
00:44:51,270 --> 00:44:55,440
other than that or these different
populations and so what segregates them?

920
00:44:55,530 --> 00:44:59,990
So it's just probably more like
based on density. Um, so the,

921
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:03,230
the inner objects are denser and
formed under hotter conditions,

922
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:04,410
so they're more consolidated,

923
00:45:04,411 --> 00:45:07,670
their rocky then metally the
ones on that outer edge, uh,

924
00:45:07,710 --> 00:45:10,830
probably they're probably form what the
comment is falling and when knocked into

925
00:45:10,831 --> 00:45:15,000
there. So they are a lot less than
say, probably have a lot of poor space.

926
00:45:15,001 --> 00:45:18,700
So actually when we got to the
risotto comment, I'm 67 P we,

927
00:45:18,740 --> 00:45:21,180
we weren't able to measure its density.
Um,

928
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:25,290
which is really cool because although
it's made of rock and it's made of ice,

929
00:45:25,470 --> 00:45:28,140
it's actually has a really
low density, um, because it's,

930
00:45:28,230 --> 00:45:29,820
it's got lots of holes in it,
so they're not,

931
00:45:29,821 --> 00:45:33,480
because it's not like gaping big holes
in the side of it and like cavities,

932
00:45:33,660 --> 00:45:37,180
but it's very porous. Every
fine scale, but very poorest.

933
00:45:37,181 --> 00:45:40,200
Like it's got a lot of gaps in it. So
it's just not very well pushed together.

934
00:45:40,470 --> 00:45:43,910
Whereas the objects on the inner
asteroid belt, a very kind of, no,

935
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:48,180
probably no ball space whatsoever.
Um, so that basically controls it.

936
00:45:48,181 --> 00:45:49,650
So these as you move on out,

937
00:45:49,651 --> 00:45:53,530
you've just probably got a transition
gradually from the inner to outer.

938
00:45:54,380 --> 00:45:55,560
Gotcha. Thank you. Okay.

939
00:45:59,940 --> 00:46:03,030
In College I did something,
uh,

940
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:05,970
where we had,
um,

941
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:09,710
we had designed these transmitters
to put on near Earth objects. Um,

942
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:13,200
that there was a lot of concern that
the smaller objects that were harder to

943
00:46:13,201 --> 00:46:14,450
detect,
um,

944
00:46:14,550 --> 00:46:18,540
could be the thing that does us in instead
of the larger objects that are easier

945
00:46:18,541 --> 00:46:22,700
to detect. Yeah. Um, and it was just a,

946
00:46:22,820 --> 00:46:25,290
is a design class.
We didn't actually deploy it,

947
00:46:25,291 --> 00:46:29,880
but is there any like movement and trying
to do anything to look at near Earth

948
00:46:29,881 --> 00:46:30,860
objects. Okay. So

949
00:46:30,860 --> 00:46:33,360
yeah, we are currently tracking, uh,

950
00:46:33,380 --> 00:46:36,700
basically all the narrow objects
that we can possibly see. Um,

951
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:38,570
the ones that are caught
sort of a normal orbits.

952
00:46:38,571 --> 00:46:42,020
I say those ones because there could
be some random objects that are at the

953
00:46:42,021 --> 00:46:44,600
moment far out that are going
to become near Earth objects.

954
00:46:44,601 --> 00:46:47,600
But we don't know they're coming
here because they're very small. But,

955
00:46:47,630 --> 00:46:51,510
so those are kind of the unknown.
The unknown. Unknown's I guess. Um,

956
00:46:51,650 --> 00:46:55,730
but the ones that we can see and we
are tracing the orbits of all the time,

957
00:46:55,731 --> 00:47:00,230
so we're constantly updating where we
think they're going and how that spinning

958
00:47:00,470 --> 00:47:02,660
because it's very important to
understand how they heat it up.

959
00:47:02,661 --> 00:47:05,510
I said earlier about deflect to them.
If he paint one side a different color,

960
00:47:05,511 --> 00:47:09,430
it will spin differently.
Well, there's two effects that
happen in space. Your pen,

961
00:47:09,431 --> 00:47:11,390
your cops get effects and that and they,

962
00:47:11,391 --> 00:47:14,960
that determines how these things spin
and how it affects that all bit basically

963
00:47:14,961 --> 00:47:17,330
as they heated up by the sun.
So it's,

964
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:19,370
we sort of know most of
them are going to hit us,

965
00:47:19,371 --> 00:47:23,750
but we need to just define
those two phenomena very
clearly and then we can know

966
00:47:23,751 --> 00:47:25,070
exactly where they're going to go.

967
00:47:25,250 --> 00:47:27,890
So some of these objects are
on sort of a hazardous less,

968
00:47:27,891 --> 00:47:30,850
but we just need to better define where
they're going and then they can be

969
00:47:30,851 --> 00:47:32,830
removed from that list.
But yeah,

970
00:47:32,831 --> 00:47:34,750
when we're talking about
the size of these things,

971
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:37,720
it's funny because even if it was just
a couple of hundred meters across,

972
00:47:37,721 --> 00:47:40,750
it could still cause a lot of damage
depending on what it was made of.

973
00:47:40,751 --> 00:47:43,110
If it's a pure piece of
metal, yeah, sure enough it's,

974
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:46,450
it's going to probably get through the
atmosphere quite easily and wherever that

975
00:47:46,451 --> 00:47:47,081
hits okay.

976
00:47:47,081 --> 00:47:50,680
It might not cause global devastation
like we saw with the dinosaurs being

977
00:47:50,681 --> 00:47:52,070
killed off,
but you know,

978
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:55,690
it could cause quite a lot of issues
and we've had impacts in the past,

979
00:47:55,810 --> 00:47:58,360
which haven't been massive, but
they can create things like, yeah,

980
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:01,370
nuclear winters essentially,
you can have it as a near like a,

981
00:48:01,390 --> 00:48:04,120
when you get a massive volcanic eruption,
like it's the same kind of thing.

982
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:07,120
You can change the climate of the
planet for a considerable time.

983
00:48:07,540 --> 00:48:12,250
And I would suggest that humans are
fairly kind of, um, a vulnerable species.

984
00:48:12,251 --> 00:48:16,360
We want clean water, we require
movement around the planet quite a lot.

985
00:48:16,361 --> 00:48:20,110
And I think if anything like
that happened, we could be
quite vulnerable species.

986
00:48:20,111 --> 00:48:22,410
So, even if it was a smallish impacts, um,

987
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:25,300
it could just cause quite a lot of issues.
Obviously the larger impacts,

988
00:48:25,301 --> 00:48:27,700
if we're talking kilometer
sized bodies are larger,

989
00:48:28,090 --> 00:48:31,990
they're going to be a bigger problem. So
understanding those kinds of small ones,

990
00:48:32,020 --> 00:48:34,240
there's still quite large
is really important area,

991
00:48:34,241 --> 00:48:38,490
kind of 400 meters across and so
is they're pretty dangerous. Um,

992
00:48:38,530 --> 00:48:40,960
and they're hard to see.
So we need to understand those,

993
00:48:40,961 --> 00:48:44,860
especially if they're dog, if they're
proper lake, dark carbonaceous asteroids,

994
00:48:44,890 --> 00:48:47,650
they're very hard to see because
they don't give off much light.

995
00:48:47,651 --> 00:48:49,600
So that's what astronomers rely on,

996
00:48:49,601 --> 00:48:52,150
these things giving off light and
that's why comments are easier to see.

997
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:56,680
They shine. Whereas asteroids can be a
bit sneaky. So we have to be careful.

998
00:48:58,950 --> 00:49:03,540
I have a question about the interstellar
dust stuff gets collected. Um,

999
00:49:03,660 --> 00:49:06,750
it might be outside the
scope of this conversation,

1000
00:49:06,751 --> 00:49:09,660
but I was wondering if it
gives us any kind of, um,

1001
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:14,950
understanding of the original big
bang and maybe supporting the,

1002
00:49:15,290 --> 00:49:17,280
the theory of the Big Bang.
Um,

1003
00:49:17,340 --> 00:49:22,340
or is it really more like stuff that's
4.6 million years old and it's very

1004
00:49:22,441 --> 00:49:23,460
localized dust.

1005
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:26,440
So I'm going to have to say,
I don't know to what some of the actually,

1006
00:49:26,441 --> 00:49:29,650
cause I've not kept up with that
interstellar stuff very well,

1007
00:49:29,651 --> 00:49:34,240
but I know that it's basically allow
us to look into our local galaxy.

1008
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:37,810
Um, and I don't exactly know
when that dust was formed. Um,

1009
00:49:37,990 --> 00:49:39,760
but what they've been able
to do is actually measure,

1010
00:49:39,761 --> 00:49:42,450
like the eyes are tapes of the
elements of that material. Um,

1011
00:49:42,530 --> 00:49:46,000
and that allows us to understand
a lot about our local environment,

1012
00:49:46,001 --> 00:49:48,870
like what our solar system
formed from and have a seat.

1013
00:49:48,871 --> 00:49:52,400
We expect that different galaxies are
going to be different compositions, um,

1014
00:49:52,660 --> 00:49:54,670
because they formed at
different times maybe,

1015
00:49:54,930 --> 00:49:56,920
I mean the were still don't
really understand all of that.

1016
00:49:56,921 --> 00:49:59,290
So because we haven't able
to sample it or, you know,

1017
00:49:59,670 --> 00:50:01,960
look at it very clearly because
these things are so far away.

1018
00:50:01,961 --> 00:50:06,490
So it's kind of understanding a little
bit further back in our history, um,

1019
00:50:06,550 --> 00:50:10,720
what is in there. But yeah, I'd
have to say I'm not too sure. Yeah.

1020
00:50:11,110 --> 00:50:14,260
So recently there was big news about this,
uh,

1021
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:18,310
asteroid from outside the solar
system that blitzed through. Oh,

1022
00:50:18,311 --> 00:50:21,490
I'm so glad you mentioned this. I haven't
mentioned it yet, so yeah. Yeah. Okay,

1023
00:50:21,491 --> 00:50:24,760
great. Um, is that something that uh,

1024
00:50:24,820 --> 00:50:28,100
was a one in a hundred year
event or was that a question of

1025
00:50:28,130 --> 00:50:31,040
our sensors are getting better and
we can expect to see more of them?

1026
00:50:31,041 --> 00:50:35,240
The more we play the latter. So we think,
so I'll just backtrack a little bit.

1027
00:50:35,241 --> 00:50:38,360
Say this, I'm objects that
came through our solar system.

1028
00:50:38,361 --> 00:50:40,370
We actually think now it
was probably a comment,

1029
00:50:40,371 --> 00:50:41,420
but we're not a hundred percent sure.

1030
00:50:41,421 --> 00:50:43,790
We weren't able to measure it very well
cause we didn't know it was coming,

1031
00:50:43,791 --> 00:50:47,600
but so it wasn't on the normal or bear
that all the other comments and asteroids

1032
00:50:47,601 --> 00:50:50,420
and planets are on. It just literally
came zipping through our solar system.

1033
00:50:50,421 --> 00:50:54,140
It was so fast that it didn't even get
caught into the gravity of our sun.

1034
00:50:54,141 --> 00:50:58,640
It just zip by and it came from some
other star system. We have no idea where.

1035
00:50:58,641 --> 00:51:02,960
And it's probably been some
like interstellar traveler
for forever. Who knows?

1036
00:51:02,961 --> 00:51:05,820
When it formed, it came
from very far away. Um,

1037
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:10,310
so it's been going for at least billions
of years. Um, and it just zipped through.

1038
00:51:10,340 --> 00:51:14,360
So we don't know a lot about it. We just
know that it's, I think it's called Moo.

1039
00:51:14,570 --> 00:51:19,310
Is it called Miramar? Like I think
it's Hawaiian for Muah. Muah. I think.

1040
00:51:19,340 --> 00:51:23,450
Um, and I think it's Hawaiian
for something like a distant
traveler or something

1041
00:51:23,451 --> 00:51:26,680
like this. Um, I probably pronounced
it wrong. I didn't know Hawaiian. Um,

1042
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:29,600
but basically we,
if we knew one of these was coming,

1043
00:51:29,601 --> 00:51:32,540
we could launch a mission again to
go and sample it because this will be

1044
00:51:32,541 --> 00:51:35,240
fascinating. We'd learn about that
star system that it came from,

1045
00:51:35,241 --> 00:51:39,170
which could be completely different to
what we're seeing here. Probably would be,

1046
00:51:39,340 --> 00:51:40,880
um, it could be the same, who knows,

1047
00:51:40,881 --> 00:51:43,460
but we know it came from somewhere else
and we just haven't seen one of these

1048
00:51:43,461 --> 00:51:43,760
before.

1049
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:47,570
I think probably other objects like
that have gone through the solar system,

1050
00:51:47,571 --> 00:51:49,730
but we haven't spotted them.
They get very fast.

1051
00:51:49,731 --> 00:51:52,220
I think it was just chance
that it was seen as well. Um,

1052
00:51:52,430 --> 00:51:56,300
but it is fascinating and I would love
to have some sample of that comment.

1053
00:51:56,310 --> 00:51:59,990
There would be so cool to analyze.
But um, yeah, I'm hoping, you know,

1054
00:51:59,991 --> 00:52:02,540
in the future as we get better at
seeing these things coming again,

1055
00:52:02,541 --> 00:52:04,850
it wasn't very big.
It was also really weirdly shaped.

1056
00:52:04,851 --> 00:52:08,300
It was like a cigar shape and really
long and kind of like, you know,

1057
00:52:08,301 --> 00:52:09,950
maybe it's some alien spaceship,
who knows.

1058
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:13,260
Basically you're saying we're
being visited by cigars.

1059
00:52:13,710 --> 00:52:14,543
Yeah,

1060
00:52:15,350 --> 00:52:20,020
it would be so happy. Um, uh, so, uh, we
just have a couple minutes left and I,

1061
00:52:20,021 --> 00:52:21,260
I wanted to ask you,
um,

1062
00:52:21,370 --> 00:52:24,550
if a European space agency or NASA or
somebody came to you and said, hey,

1063
00:52:24,551 --> 00:52:26,230
we'd like you to be the
principal investigator,

1064
00:52:26,231 --> 00:52:28,600
that is the top science person
for the next space mission,

1065
00:52:28,930 --> 00:52:30,850
it's going to go and maybe
explore one of these objects.

1066
00:52:30,851 --> 00:52:32,860
What would you want it to be?
What would you do it?

1067
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:33,790
What would you do with that mission?

1068
00:52:34,050 --> 00:52:35,640
Oh, I wouldn't be able to cheese. I mean,

1069
00:52:35,641 --> 00:52:40,410
so at the moment we've got these missions,
Osiris Rex, I'll give you two, just one.

1070
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:41,333
So I,

1071
00:52:41,350 --> 00:52:46,350
I would want to go and explore the
cope about better get samples of it.

1072
00:52:46,411 --> 00:52:50,070
I'd want to explore more of the
comments but equally some of them really

1073
00:52:50,071 --> 00:52:52,800
exciting scientific things happening
right now and sell it to us and you've

1074
00:52:52,801 --> 00:52:53,090
opened up,

1075
00:52:53,090 --> 00:52:56,220
this isn't comets and asteroids but this
is potentially finding a life in our

1076
00:52:56,221 --> 00:52:57,110
solar system.
Um,

1077
00:52:57,270 --> 00:53:02,270
these are moons of Jupiter and Saturn and
they have liquid oceans beneath an icy

1078
00:53:02,401 --> 00:53:05,850
crust and there's a really high
potential that they could have life.

1079
00:53:05,851 --> 00:53:10,110
Probably not intelligent life, but there
could be life then for me at the moment.

1080
00:53:10,111 --> 00:53:11,550
I'm just fascinated by that and I,

1081
00:53:12,060 --> 00:53:13,720
we are going to one it
again to your right per,

1082
00:53:13,721 --> 00:53:16,320
so hopefully my wife was
working in Europe only. Okay.

1083
00:53:16,350 --> 00:53:19,150
So that's going to be seen and
we will hopefully go there.

1084
00:53:19,160 --> 00:53:21,570
The Europa Clipper mission, um, Enceladus,

1085
00:53:21,930 --> 00:53:26,220
unfortunately we found the Ansel or just
had this liquidation as after they'd

1086
00:53:26,221 --> 00:53:27,430
already planned the sessions she wrote.
But,

1087
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:29,850
but it might actually be a better
place to look for life. It might,

1088
00:53:30,090 --> 00:53:33,450
it doesn't have quite the same horrible
radiation environment that you ripped

1089
00:53:33,451 --> 00:53:33,740
pat.

1090
00:53:33,740 --> 00:53:38,740
So I fuck on shoes and actually cotton
choose Pluto is also fascinating.

1091
00:53:39,001 --> 00:53:42,600
It would, we've flown by it. We've learned
a lot by just flying by it, but it's an,

1092
00:53:42,601 --> 00:53:45,960
it's a copa object.
It's basically a large comment and um,

1093
00:53:46,290 --> 00:53:49,560
but there's probably other
really fascinating objects
in the Kuiper belt that we

1094
00:53:49,561 --> 00:53:51,990
need to look at.
So we just haven't explored it enough.

1095
00:53:51,991 --> 00:53:55,870
We need and it's just too far away. So
yeah, I need to kind of speed up, time,

1096
00:53:55,900 --> 00:54:00,050
time travel and then come back and get
some samples. But yeah, I didn't know.

1097
00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:04,560
It's, it's wonderful to have so many
good choices. Yeah, that's true.

1098
00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:08,370
Um, doctor Starkey thi this has been a
terrific conversation. Thank you so much.

1099
00:54:08,390 --> 00:54:10,880
Um, keep having the book.
Absolutely. Our pleasure. Uh,

1100
00:54:10,980 --> 00:54:12,630
the book is catching stardust,
comets,

1101
00:54:12,631 --> 00:54:15,570
asteroids in the birth of the solar
system and all this stuff we talked about

1102
00:54:15,571 --> 00:54:18,090
and so much more as in it. I
encourage you to read it. Um,

1103
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:20,400
please join me in thanking
our guest today, Dr Natalie's.
