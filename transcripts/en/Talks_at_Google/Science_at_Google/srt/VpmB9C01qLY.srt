1
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:11,470
[inaudible]

2
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:14,350
delighted to be here today.
And thank you so much for coming.

3
00:00:14,351 --> 00:00:15,390
It's a great audience.

4
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:19,830
And I hope I'll introduce you to a subject
that I've been interested in for most

5
00:00:19,831 --> 00:00:24,330
of my adult life and have tried to
distill into this little book. Um, it's,

6
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:27,230
I've got a coauthor who was
actually a student of mine, uh,

7
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:31,680
Katy von [inaudible] who works in the u
s and so we tried to make sure that the

8
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,280
book wasn't just a UK based book.
She's bought in some ideas,

9
00:00:35,281 --> 00:00:39,420
particularly she's also Dutch, so we've
got the European and the U S perspective.

10
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:43,980
Um, so she's, she's a, she works
in the, in the u s at the moment.

11
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:50,060
So I, I'm going to try and just
briefly introduce you to this area. Um,

12
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:54,260
it's, it's a, it's covers a
range of, of, of, of specialties,

13
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:58,420
but I'm going to tend to speak from my
own experience, which is inevitable. Uh,

14
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:00,350
I'm, I'm, um, I've,

15
00:01:00,351 --> 00:01:04,650
I've worked as a clinical psychologist
originally training just to work in, in,

16
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:05,610
in clinical work.

17
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,630
But in later years I found myself being
more interested in research and then

18
00:01:09,631 --> 00:01:12,930
eventually in teaching and training.
So my last post,

19
00:01:12,931 --> 00:01:15,240
the last 20 years has been running the,

20
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:20,010
the doctoral training course in Oxford
to train new clinical psychologists.

21
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:20,911
And as such,

22
00:01:20,911 --> 00:01:25,911
I had to have a kind of overview of the
whole subject and hopefully was then

23
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:29,750
therefore in a good position to write
this very short introduction as you know,

24
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:33,720
35,000 words. And I worked in
the air for about 40 years,

25
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,340
so we bought a thousand words per year
of my life went into this book and

26
00:01:38,341 --> 00:01:40,320
therefore it's quite crumbed.
Um,

27
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:44,700
so what I'm going to try to do is really
talk to you about what it's about and

28
00:01:44,701 --> 00:01:47,910
what we're trying to do
as clinical psychologists.

29
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:53,070
And I suppose the best place to start is
if you like what I often say to my own

30
00:01:53,071 --> 00:01:56,190
family and to myself, which is,
it's actually tough being human.

31
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:58,380
Being a human being is difficult.

32
00:01:58,381 --> 00:02:02,670
We haven't so many differences and
difficulties to deal with in our lives.

33
00:02:02,671 --> 00:02:05,460
Complex feelings, emotions, desires,

34
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:09,960
challenges throughout life, managing
other people, managing ourselves,

35
00:02:09,961 --> 00:02:11,370
managing the world around us.

36
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:14,280
So I've always been interested
in how do people do this,

37
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:19,430
how do people tick and what happens
when it goes wrong and have always been

38
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:24,810
difficult is in life.
We are not unique in finding life,

39
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,100
sometimes problematic.

40
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:30,060
If you've never experienced emotional
difficulties or relationship difficulties

41
00:02:30,061 --> 00:02:30,690
in your life,

42
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:34,710
then you're incredibly lucky and I think
you'll probably quite rare sooner or

43
00:02:34,711 --> 00:02:38,730
later in your life there are things which
go wrong and I'm not going to talk in

44
00:02:38,731 --> 00:02:40,740
great depth about any individual case,

45
00:02:40,741 --> 00:02:45,030
but later on in my talk I will talk
about a couple of examples of people I've

46
00:02:45,031 --> 00:02:48,540
worked with. But it's tough managing
all the things you have to do,

47
00:02:48,541 --> 00:02:49,291
your ambitions,

48
00:02:49,291 --> 00:02:53,130
you need your family or parents
pressures and the world around you.

49
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:57,570
And that's always, I say always been the
case, not just now in in in the century,

50
00:02:57,571 --> 00:03:01,670
but in many hours, centuries. We know that
there's the has always been different.

51
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:06,430
Not everybody finds it easy just to get
on happily in the world that they're

52
00:03:06,431 --> 00:03:11,431
born into and they've always been ways
societies had to offer people somewhere

53
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,740
feeling better about
themselves and other people.

54
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:17,020
When people find things difficult,

55
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:21,160
and I've just listed historically arrange
of ways in which society has offered

56
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:25,490
people who are struggling a bit and
there are many ways of dealing with the

57
00:03:25,491 --> 00:03:28,510
stress of [inaudible],
right? So start off as a law.

58
00:03:28,511 --> 00:03:33,160
People who behave differently or
oddly we deal with them legally,

59
00:03:33,161 --> 00:03:36,550
we put them in a class. Maybe that's
somebody who's got, who's behaving badly.

60
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:38,920
We put them in prison,
we put them away somewhere.

61
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:43,330
So the law deals with people and this to
this day when people start behave Bevin

62
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:46,360
strange in the street or something
happens, which is challenging,

63
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:48,850
we may call the police or
a lawyer to deal with that.

64
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:52,330
That's one way of dealing with
people who are behaving differently.

65
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:57,220
Another way of course is medicine and
medicine has always been a place nowadays

66
00:03:57,221 --> 00:04:01,690
we tend to turn to if you are unhappy
currency or GP and maybe they can find

67
00:04:01,691 --> 00:04:03,250
some way of helping you with that.

68
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:07,870
Other ways include religion and somewhere
that if you like you can go and see a

69
00:04:07,871 --> 00:04:12,220
priest. And typically and historically
these three uh, three methods,

70
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,150
the law,

71
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:17,440
medicine and religion have been where the
people dealt with feeling low feeling,

72
00:04:17,710 --> 00:04:20,470
having difficulties, children
behaving, her challenging,

73
00:04:20,471 --> 00:04:24,450
behaving in ways which we want
to change those if you like.

74
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:28,180
Those are the big ways in the past,
people that dealt with difficulties.

75
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:32,470
I've also put magic there because again,
another approach is for example,

76
00:04:32,471 --> 00:04:36,040
using astrology or some other sort of
technique to deal with people who are

77
00:04:36,041 --> 00:04:38,110
behaving strange or feel
bad about themselves.

78
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:42,640
And to this day you could look up in
[inaudible] astronomical science and look

79
00:04:42,641 --> 00:04:44,290
up what,
what read the future.

80
00:04:44,291 --> 00:04:48,130
People still use us the way of making
themselves feel better when they're not

81
00:04:48,131 --> 00:04:48,964
happy.

82
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:52,660
I mentioned politics there again cause
such changing society is another way of

83
00:04:52,661 --> 00:04:54,920
trying to change people's emotions and,
and,

84
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:59,890
and ability to get on with life if like
those have been the big ways in which in

85
00:04:59,891 --> 00:05:03,790
the past we've dealt with distress but
increasingly and certainly since the 19th

86
00:05:03,791 --> 00:05:06,660
century, people try to
understand the mind to Perth,

87
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:10,660
try to understand what's going on inside
our heads and the science of psychology

88
00:05:10,661 --> 00:05:14,140
has developed. And that's the
background to clinical psychology.

89
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:18,180
And I will just briefly mention
what that is and if you, um,

90
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:23,390
psychology is now the most in demand
undergraduate course in the UK to do your,

91
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:28,090
to do your degree in and it's the most
competitive one most competitive degrees

92
00:05:28,091 --> 00:05:31,960
to do. And it's a site, it's a study
of human experience and behavior.

93
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:35,590
And very quickly I've run through
some of the things that happens within

94
00:05:35,591 --> 00:05:38,710
psychology in order to become
a clinical psychologist.

95
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:42,430
You studied this first and the kind
of things we'd study is how is it,

96
00:05:42,431 --> 00:05:46,390
we learn things, how we, our memory works
and importantly how we forget things.

97
00:05:46,391 --> 00:05:48,280
That's very important part of the system.

98
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:52,960
What stress does to us and how we
are different from other species,

99
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:56,680
how hormones operate on us and how,
for example,

100
00:05:56,681 --> 00:06:00,560
drunks called work on the body
and the mind, why do we sleep,

101
00:06:00,561 --> 00:06:05,240
why don't we sleep? Um, and what it
is, how the perceptual system works,

102
00:06:05,241 --> 00:06:08,900
how the brain sees
fields and our emotions,

103
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:12,200
work perception, how
perception works, how we are,

104
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:15,260
how we recognize people and
how we attend to other people,

105
00:06:15,261 --> 00:06:17,960
to anything else and
how we make judgments.

106
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:20,960
So the whole way in which the brain
works is the subject of psychology.

107
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:25,130
And as a science, it's really quite
recent, maybe two, 200 years or so.

108
00:06:25,131 --> 00:06:29,000
But the most progress has been
made within the last 50 years.

109
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:32,330
Other things psychology does
is why we have emotions,

110
00:06:32,331 --> 00:06:36,200
what we feel and particularly child
development, how children learn, how to,

111
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:40,730
how they learn social behavior
and language and how people
attach to one another.

112
00:06:40,731 --> 00:06:44,960
Now important relationships
are how children's separate,

113
00:06:44,961 --> 00:06:47,330
when they eventually do what
that process is more important,

114
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:51,500
important it is and what the effects
of aging are. How we get along,

115
00:06:51,501 --> 00:06:53,960
how we behave differently
socially with other people.

116
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:58,040
And how groups differ from one
another and why we get on without the,

117
00:06:58,070 --> 00:06:59,660
how we get along with authority.

118
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:04,490
There's just a sampling of what you
study in psychology. So that incentive,

119
00:07:04,491 --> 00:07:06,020
you might have done a psychology degree.

120
00:07:06,021 --> 00:07:10,010
This will be familiar to you and this
is the equivalent as in medicine.

121
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:12,440
I studied genetics, physiology, anatomy.

122
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:14,810
So if you want to be a
clinical psychologist,

123
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:18,920
you do all this first so you have a
notion of how the human mind works and how

124
00:07:18,921 --> 00:07:21,800
people behave.
So that's our bread and butter.

125
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:25,340
So that if likes a degree
that I originally studied,

126
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:29,240
but I was most interested in what
would it all goes wrong when people are

127
00:07:29,241 --> 00:07:33,410
unhappy and what happens during the
periods of life for most of us have some

128
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:34,244
challenges.

129
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:38,020
What can we learn in the same way as
when you do anatomy and physiology and

130
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:41,530
genetics if you're a doctor,
if you're on some that, when,

131
00:07:41,531 --> 00:07:45,780
what is it when it doesn't work? So
clinical psychology, which is the same.

132
00:07:45,781 --> 00:07:50,781
My interest is the application
of psychology in clinical
settings where people

133
00:07:51,021 --> 00:07:52,040
have emotional,

134
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:56,510
own psychological difficulties and these
include hospitals in particular mental

135
00:07:56,511 --> 00:08:01,511
health and but also child health and
also or clinics where the people present

136
00:08:02,781 --> 00:08:04,250
with psychological distress.

137
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:07,940
So clinical psychologists work
in a variety of different places.

138
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:13,070
My early years in the 1970s eighties
was working in psychiatric hospitals,

139
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,560
but people also work in general hospitals,

140
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:18,170
so works across the lifespan from infants.

141
00:08:18,171 --> 00:08:23,171
So how people may have difficulties in
early relationship attachments and things

142
00:08:24,381 --> 00:08:28,430
like adoption and some of the kinds of
difficulties that children can experience

143
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:32,780
and the relationships when early bird
were between parents and babies through to

144
00:08:32,781 --> 00:08:36,440
the very old and the 12 process of
letting go of life at the end of life.

145
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:39,500
Now we will,
as clinical cycles,

146
00:08:39,501 --> 00:08:43,760
you work very closely with medicine and
I mentioned the training to become a

147
00:08:43,761 --> 00:08:47,540
doctor. One of the things you can
do, I mean, I, if you know all this,

148
00:08:47,541 --> 00:08:51,090
forgive me if I'm telling you stuff
you know, but just in case, um,

149
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:55,130
one of the specialties within medicine
when you've done your basic training,

150
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:56,790
you can choose to do with psychiatry.

151
00:08:57,180 --> 00:09:00,570
Now psychiatry is different from
clinical psychology in that to be a

152
00:09:00,571 --> 00:09:04,710
psychiatrist, which in fact our daughter
is, you have to do medicine first.

153
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:08,010
So she's done the whole business of
anatomy, physiology and all that stuff,

154
00:09:08,011 --> 00:09:09,150
which I didn't do.

155
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:13,530
So she's very familiar
with and psychiatrists know
about how the body works and

156
00:09:13,531 --> 00:09:17,430
their treatment of mental health
problems tends to be oriented towards the

157
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:19,380
physical.
So for example,

158
00:09:19,381 --> 00:09:23,430
the treatments psychiatrists tend to give
if you say so if you're suffering from

159
00:09:23,431 --> 00:09:27,570
depression or stress and you go see
a psychiatrist, they will tend to,

160
00:09:27,571 --> 00:09:28,404
first of all,

161
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:32,220
they'll do a very thorough
physical examination and
they will may well give you

162
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,780
some medical treatments,

163
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:38,250
some of the antidepressants or some
other sort of physical treatment for your

164
00:09:38,251 --> 00:09:42,300
condition. Now, I'm not
qualified to do that. I'm not
a doctor. I wouldn't do that.

165
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:46,710
But I work very closely with doctors so
that we will see people where perhaps

166
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:50,610
medical treatment isn't appropriate
or it's not thought to be helpful.

167
00:09:50,611 --> 00:09:55,410
In this case where we have
a close relationship, we
cross refer to one another,

168
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:58,440
but we have a different treatment.
Our trip is psychological,

169
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:00,810
not physical though I'm very aware.

170
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:05,020
Of course we have bodies and therefore
Homans and things are important and and

171
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:08,010
and drugs do have an impact in deed.
There's nothing wrong with,

172
00:10:08,011 --> 00:10:11,520
with psychiatric treatments
like like antidepressants,

173
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:15,390
they can be used very much
with psychological treatments.
So we worked together,

174
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:19,910
so particularly psychiatry and
we offer different perspectives.

175
00:10:19,911 --> 00:10:24,911
So by and large the model and
lung psychiatry underlying
it is a physical one,

176
00:10:26,101 --> 00:10:30,630
which is something wrong with your hormone
balance or with the endocrines or the

177
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:34,290
the brain chemicals. So you can fix
it with a match with medication.

178
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:38,790
Whereas will understand when people have
distress, depression or personality,

179
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:43,320
relationship difficulties or children
behave challenging ways or families

180
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:46,400
breakdown. There isn't an illness.
It's happened to you though.

181
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:49,590
That's convenient label.
It's not an illness.

182
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:54,300
It's a complex human response to
trauma or challenge or difficulties.

183
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:58,620
So what's wrong with you is while we
can treat it medically and often those

184
00:10:58,621 --> 00:11:01,200
treatments help.
Interestingly they do help.

185
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:04,260
The cause may be something else.

186
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:09,150
So by and large what we do is help people
to develop solutions to their problems

187
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:13,620
rather than if it come and find a
medical way of fixing it. But again,

188
00:11:13,621 --> 00:11:16,290
we do work with doctors and
if you do have depression,

189
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:20,250
often the very first useful thing to do
is to try antidepressants cause we know

190
00:11:20,251 --> 00:11:22,350
they are effective and
if they're effective,

191
00:11:22,351 --> 00:11:26,160
fine cause you can get back to work and
that's great but if it doesn't fix it or

192
00:11:26,161 --> 00:11:29,610
you don't want to use antidepressants,
often a psychological approaches,

193
00:11:29,611 --> 00:11:32,460
that is the next step.
To complicate matters,

194
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:36,220
many psychiatrists also used
psychological treatments. Uh,

195
00:11:36,221 --> 00:11:41,040
so they will use the methods I might use
but I won't be prescribing because that

196
00:11:41,041 --> 00:11:44,540
isn't my background. So we do work
with them, but our specialties,

197
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:47,490
the psychological,
based on all that research,

198
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:51,600
all that knowledge do with how
people think, how people perceive,

199
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:54,220
how people develop,
all that stuff I mentioned earlier,

200
00:11:54,221 --> 00:11:56,080
which is our kind of basic stuff.

201
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:01,390
So we work with people trying to develop
a solution to the problem and based

202
00:12:01,391 --> 00:12:03,310
very much on the
collaborative relationship.

203
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:07,630
So patients are referred to clinical
psychologists usually because they go to

204
00:12:07,631 --> 00:12:11,320
see their GP or somebody
suggests they may be,

205
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:14,710
they need a bit of help perhaps cause
that they've got difficulties in the

206
00:12:14,711 --> 00:12:15,071
family.

207
00:12:15,071 --> 00:12:20,071
The child is repeatedly challenging or
difficult or the child's very anxious or

208
00:12:20,471 --> 00:12:22,030
perhaps the adult you will me.

209
00:12:22,031 --> 00:12:25,700
And it's very much like all of us
could be in a situation, feel, uh,

210
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:27,280
feel depressed or anxious,

211
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:30,790
have difficulties in our relationships
or maybe granny is getting more and more

212
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:32,710
challenging to us living at home with us.

213
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:36,550
We didn't quite know how best to help the
family to adopt the fact we've now got

214
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:40,630
granny living with us. And
that's difficult with also
got a teenager who, who,

215
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:43,450
who wants to go out drinking
and all sorts of problems.

216
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:47,530
There's a human problems
which aren't illnesses. Can
we find a way of solving it?

217
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:51,970
And we very much work with people who
bring their problems to us and tell us

218
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:56,080
about the main conference
because it's confidential. And,

219
00:12:56,140 --> 00:13:00,940
um,W and collaborative we is,
ethics is very important to us.

220
00:13:00,941 --> 00:13:02,800
So we have a very strong ethical code.

221
00:13:02,801 --> 00:13:06,200
We are regulated by the Health
Professions Council, uh,

222
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:10,570
which is like the General Medical
Council. And we also have, um,

223
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:13,480
a professionalization of the
British psychological society,

224
00:13:13,481 --> 00:13:15,610
which has codes of ethics
that we have to abide by.

225
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:20,320
And these specify very clearly we're
there to help the patient, not ourselves.

226
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:24,250
And that's important because typically
what happens is that a patient will come

227
00:13:24,251 --> 00:13:24,590
see me,

228
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:28,750
see me and I should mention I've mostly
worked with adults will come see me with

229
00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:33,730
a problem or difficulty and will trust
me hopefully with telling me some very

230
00:13:33,731 --> 00:13:35,290
intimate personal things.

231
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:39,580
And My responsibility is to help them
the best I can solve their problems.

232
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:44,050
Not to like not because I think I've
got the answer. Uh, I can't say, oh,

233
00:13:44,051 --> 00:13:46,990
well if you voted labor,
your problems will be solved.

234
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:49,010
That wouldn't be my responsibility.
Um,

235
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:51,070
I've got to help them
work out the solution.

236
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:54,070
And if you like this little
cartoon summarizes it, um,

237
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:57,270
we're encouraging people to become
involved in their own rescue. Uh,

238
00:13:57,430 --> 00:13:58,740
I don't think that's very ethical there.

239
00:13:58,741 --> 00:14:01,570
There that might is busy reading his
comic, but one of the persons drowning,

240
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:03,010
we wouldn't quite do that.

241
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:07,060
We certainly don't come up with answers
for people because there isn't any point

242
00:14:07,061 --> 00:14:08,950
in that we don't have an answer.

243
00:14:08,951 --> 00:14:13,480
We help people to think differently and
to help them to see how they got into

244
00:14:13,481 --> 00:14:14,410
the flight,

245
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:18,250
into the situation they're in when
they're feeling muddled or they're feeling

246
00:14:18,251 --> 00:14:23,020
upset. So it's a color where our help,
I feel like we work with them to,

247
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,880
to,
to change the situation.

248
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:28,130
So the kind of people are
going to see clinical cycles.

249
00:14:28,131 --> 00:14:29,590
You see the typical clients,

250
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:34,520
peoples with phobias or fears which
are very common or anxiety. Um,

251
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:37,240
these are the in ways some of
the easiest problems to solve.

252
00:14:37,241 --> 00:14:38,260
If you've got a fear of,

253
00:14:38,530 --> 00:14:43,060
of lifts or Wasps or spiders or
cliffs or something, airplanes,

254
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:47,050
there is quite relatively straightforward
difficulties and often that's to do

255
00:14:47,051 --> 00:14:50,470
with people over longterm,
avoiding,

256
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:53,660
discovering those things are actually
quite harmless. So that's, that's a,

257
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:57,110
that's a very common difficulty.
Very common monks, children,

258
00:14:57,260 --> 00:15:00,050
people often grow out of them.
But against people and get stuck.

259
00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:01,550
People with depression,

260
00:15:01,551 --> 00:15:04,970
that's more complicated problem and the
lots of reasons why you might experience

261
00:15:04,971 --> 00:15:09,710
depression. Life is challenging for you.
We can't solve that. Life is difficult.

262
00:15:09,711 --> 00:15:10,401
Life is tough.

263
00:15:10,401 --> 00:15:14,630
Remember I said we can maybe help you
to understand the ways you've tried to

264
00:15:14,631 --> 00:15:18,920
solve your depression are
paradoxically not helping you. Um,

265
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:21,140
so things like relationship problems,

266
00:15:21,141 --> 00:15:23,960
people who've got against stuck
in things which are difficult,

267
00:15:23,961 --> 00:15:28,880
needs another perspective. People
with eating disorders and psychosis,

268
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,350
psychosis if um, is a, if you like how
we tend to use the term now, Robin,

269
00:15:33,351 --> 00:15:35,960
schizophrenia or manic,
manic depression,

270
00:15:35,961 --> 00:15:39,470
those are words we tend not to use so
much now because we're much more thinking

271
00:15:39,471 --> 00:15:43,850
about what's going on in the mind.
Psychosis is disordered thinking.

272
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:48,050
We're starting to understand it
better now. Um, based on lots of good,

273
00:15:48,051 --> 00:15:51,680
very good psychological research,
but very serious mental health problems,

274
00:15:51,681 --> 00:15:55,130
which are very challenging and
very disruptive to people's lives.

275
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:59,030
People who have long term difficulties
in the past used to be hospitalized,

276
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:02,570
but now we have better ways of managing
it together with psychiatrists who have

277
00:16:02,571 --> 00:16:06,800
better drugs to help. Also people
physical illnesses like cancer,

278
00:16:06,801 --> 00:16:10,460
stroke or spinal injury.
If you have a life threatening illness,

279
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:14,870
it affects the way you think and feel
inevitably and children with a range of

280
00:16:14,871 --> 00:16:19,280
family and individual. Um, uh,
disorders of different types. Um,

281
00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:22,520
difficulty in relationships,
school refusals,

282
00:16:23,810 --> 00:16:27,530
disruptive behavior in the family or
child anxiety, which is very common.

283
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:30,560
And people with brain injuries
and developmental disorders,

284
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:34,100
all of which have a psychological
component. You can't just have,

285
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:38,720
say diabetes or stroke or heart disease
without it also affecting how you think

286
00:16:38,721 --> 00:16:43,130
and feel.
So we use a number of models.

287
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:45,380
Some of you have heard a
CBT that's very common.

288
00:16:45,381 --> 00:16:49,490
Now the cognitive model says the thing
that's let's pay attention to when

289
00:16:49,491 --> 00:16:52,190
there's a disorder on happiest.
It's how you think.

290
00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:54,800
So we think we look at how
it is your understanding,

291
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,880
your perceptions of what's going on.
Um,

292
00:16:58,260 --> 00:17:02,630
the underlying idea here is that sometimes
people can understand something in a

293
00:17:02,631 --> 00:17:05,690
particular way,
which leads them to a particular emotions.

294
00:17:05,930 --> 00:17:09,560
And what's difficult is the way they're
thinking when you are depressed.

295
00:17:09,561 --> 00:17:12,140
For example, we know when
people suffer from depression,

296
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:16,190
they tend to think in more concrete ways.
They jump conclusions,

297
00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:18,290
they'll see things in
more black and white,

298
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:22,310
which can lead you to make
assumptions about the world. Um,

299
00:17:22,370 --> 00:17:25,220
and I'll come back to them in a
in, in a minute, but that can lead,

300
00:17:25,221 --> 00:17:27,440
that can aggravate your low mood.

301
00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:31,010
So when we're walking with working with
depression using a cognitive model,

302
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,240
we try to help,
help,

303
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:35,540
help people to see how their thinking
is actually unhelpful to them.

304
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:39,110
Behavioral people. We'd use
treatments, for example,

305
00:17:39,111 --> 00:17:43,640
say with children whereby people,
we help people to train how they behave.

306
00:17:43,641 --> 00:17:45,680
And again,
that leads to different consequences.

307
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:50,160
CBT is a combination of
behaviorism and therapy,

308
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:53,820
which is increasingly popular. A lot of
evidence suggests it's very effective.

309
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:56,460
Psychodynamic,
this is more fraudulent thinking.

310
00:17:56,461 --> 00:17:59,180
Try to understand relationships
in particular attachments,

311
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:02,790
difficult difficulties. People have the
attachments or what I call systemic.

312
00:18:02,791 --> 00:18:06,780
This is trying to [inaudible] system
around you perhaps at work or in your

313
00:18:06,781 --> 00:18:11,220
family is aggravating or difficulties.
So we'll use all these models.

314
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:16,380
The way we work is,
is I feel like a series of stages.

315
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:19,320
First of all the person has assessed.
So a person seeing me,

316
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:23,010
I lost them about what's happening to
their lives. Uh, what's happened to them,

317
00:18:23,011 --> 00:18:25,830
what, what, what's the history of the
problem? What's going on in your life,

318
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:29,310
who's in your family, are you working,
what else is happening to you?

319
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:32,310
So we might use questionnaires
or just talking to somebody.

320
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:35,340
We might pay attention to how
they are in relationship with us.

321
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:39,840
So our a very challenging or they very
passive to a pay attention to those

322
00:18:39,841 --> 00:18:41,280
things in if like in the room,

323
00:18:41,281 --> 00:18:45,510
in the assessment room will then come up
with a formulation which is a bit like

324
00:18:45,511 --> 00:18:50,340
the diagnosis in medicine and
in particularly interested
in the predisposing

325
00:18:50,341 --> 00:18:51,460
factors. What, what, what,

326
00:18:51,461 --> 00:18:55,710
why does this person have this problem
here and what is something in the

327
00:18:55,711 --> 00:18:58,140
background, perhaps they come
from a background where people,

328
00:18:58,290 --> 00:19:00,890
branches and the family.
What precipitated,

329
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:05,340
what happened last week or a month ago
that led to it happening now and what is

330
00:19:05,341 --> 00:19:09,480
the presenting problem? What's going on,
why is it staying there? Why is it purple?

331
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,400
Why is it perpetuated?
Why haven't people,

332
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:14,610
people don't want to be sick or
ill unhappy? Why is it going on?

333
00:19:14,611 --> 00:19:18,180
What's what's going on? Why is it
perpetuating? And if you'd like,

334
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:20,460
what is going on?
We should protect in them in their lives.

335
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:24,000
Everybody has some good things.
So have they got good relationships?

336
00:19:24,001 --> 00:19:26,790
Have they got good job?
Have they got something somewhere,

337
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:29,520
which is also helping them to manage.
So we need to know all of that.

338
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:32,250
We then come up with a formulation,
which is a trial,

339
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:35,730
which is like a diagnosis and I'll
show you some formulations in a minute.

340
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,950
We then do w in agreement.

341
00:19:37,951 --> 00:19:42,150
We'll draw up a plan to intervene
to change things. For example,

342
00:19:42,151 --> 00:19:44,010
if we use a cognitive model,

343
00:19:44,011 --> 00:19:47,940
we might say we might set about a
series of cognitive experiments,

344
00:19:47,941 --> 00:19:52,000
helping them to think differently about
what of the problem is or behavior.

345
00:19:52,001 --> 00:19:56,470
We will, again, we may set
up against mental experiments
to do with the person. Uh,

346
00:19:56,490 --> 00:19:59,550
there's just an example. Someone who's
frightened of going up and down and lifts.

347
00:19:59,551 --> 00:20:01,380
They're frightened or some
catastrophic will happen.

348
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:04,110
Very scared to go near left you,
uplevel let's,

349
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:06,570
you'd have to walk up and down
the stairs every day, be a pain.

350
00:20:06,930 --> 00:20:10,770
So what we will do is help the person
who's very frightened. This first of all,

351
00:20:10,771 --> 00:20:14,580
watch me going up, trusting me.
I'll go up and down and lift that,

352
00:20:14,581 --> 00:20:15,301
watch me doing it.

353
00:20:15,301 --> 00:20:19,410
Then eventually we'll stand inside the
left without closing the doors and I'll

354
00:20:19,411 --> 00:20:21,900
get used to that.
Next time we'll go inside.

355
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:25,230
Perhaps they'll go up together on
one floor, which is very scary,

356
00:20:25,410 --> 00:20:27,510
but I'll be with them,
helping them to relax,

357
00:20:27,511 --> 00:20:29,760
helping them to experience less tension.

358
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:33,560
And then the next time we might get them
to go up three floors and finally it

359
00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:36,780
got on their own, up and
down. So that would be very
simple. Behavioral treatment.

360
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:41,080
If it's relationship problem, it's
not quite as simple as that. Um,

361
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:44,020
as you can imagine. But we would
come up with some other ways of,

362
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:47,920
of suggesting an alternative within
evaluate. Did it work? Didn't it work?

363
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:50,200
If it didn't work, go back to
square one, try something else.

364
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:52,990
At the same time we're doing with search
because we want to make sure we have

365
00:20:52,991 --> 00:20:57,430
the right treatments for the future.
How we tend to turn work will,

366
00:20:57,431 --> 00:20:59,620
it takes about eight years to train,
see somebody.

367
00:20:59,621 --> 00:21:01,660
So I said to go in psychology first,

368
00:21:01,661 --> 00:21:04,690
then we don't like to take
somebody straight off because
they're very young and

369
00:21:04,691 --> 00:21:08,550
a little bit exit experienced when you're
21 so we often ask them to come and

370
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:10,480
get some work in the workplace.

371
00:21:10,481 --> 00:21:13,420
May Be in hospitals or somewhere where
they're working with people and make sure

372
00:21:13,421 --> 00:21:16,990
that they get bit more experience.
We then do a three year doctorate,

373
00:21:16,991 --> 00:21:18,880
so that's why it's around
eight years altogether,

374
00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:22,300
which is what my last job is
doing that to train people.

375
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:27,130
Our model is want landline is science
practitioner and I was, you're practicing,

376
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:32,110
we're not in labs but we are using notion
of science because we test something.

377
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:34,720
Does it work? Doesn't it work? If it
doesn't work, we try something else.

378
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:37,780
We're always measuring has it worked?
What's the outcome?

379
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:40,060
We get people to fill in,
questionnaires, drive them mad,

380
00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:43,000
but we need to do that to make
sure we are on the right lines.

381
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:46,990
And we use research based evidence trials
which indicate what's what works and

382
00:21:46,991 --> 00:21:49,660
what doesn't.
A lot of a role for that.

383
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:52,060
We spend a long time reflecting,

384
00:21:52,090 --> 00:21:55,720
we need to make sure we're
behaving ethically and we're
aware of the context of

385
00:21:55,721 --> 00:21:58,720
what's what people want to
do in one context with them.

386
00:21:58,721 --> 00:22:03,580
With one ethnic grouping might be
different for another one. In the UK,

387
00:22:03,581 --> 00:22:07,120
this is pretty much based in
the NHS. We've, we're fun,

388
00:22:07,130 --> 00:22:10,060
we're trending is funded in the
NHS in the rest of the world.

389
00:22:10,061 --> 00:22:11,590
It's very different people,

390
00:22:11,591 --> 00:22:15,580
very much self fund the training and
work privately as a little bit of private

391
00:22:15,581 --> 00:22:18,880
work in the UK increasingly.
But I've never worked private myself.

392
00:22:18,881 --> 00:22:22,420
I spent all my life in the
NHS or in academia. Um,

393
00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:24,310
if you want to see a
clinical psychologist,

394
00:22:24,311 --> 00:22:27,850
they do advertise them
increasingly working privately. Um,

395
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:31,700
we normally it's people referred
by GP or another medical specialty.

396
00:22:31,701 --> 00:22:33,790
So for example,
a renal specialist might say,

397
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:37,720
this person is having difficulties
adapting to the needs on dialysis.

398
00:22:37,721 --> 00:22:40,870
Can you help them?
Or this person's had a brain injury,

399
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:45,010
let's work with them with a farmers
to help them back to normal life.

400
00:22:45,550 --> 00:22:49,060
And it's typically based on a series
of sessions over several months.

401
00:22:49,061 --> 00:22:52,750
So as the course of treatment
might be six months or whatever,

402
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:55,360
or less depending on what the problem is.

403
00:22:56,650 --> 00:22:59,080
So I'll come up with the calendar and,

404
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:01,210
and I'm just going to show you a
formulation. This is a bit tricky,

405
00:23:01,211 --> 00:23:05,560
but we often don't diagrams. So I want
you to have a look at this person here.

406
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:08,440
The very bottom, this diagram,
if you can see this person,

407
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:12,520
and this is a case taken from an from
book by Royale and courage as mentioned in

408
00:23:12,521 --> 00:23:16,240
the book at the very bottom, this person
came to see it. She's a woman. She came,

409
00:23:16,241 --> 00:23:17,200
her name was Beatrice.

410
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:21,760
It comes to see the psychiatrist or
psychologist feeling really depressed.

411
00:23:21,761 --> 00:23:26,010
She describes us as being like a frozen
chicken in the supermarket. She says,

412
00:23:26,011 --> 00:23:29,440
she's like wrapped up in cling
film as a frozen chicken.

413
00:23:29,441 --> 00:23:33,010
That's a self image of herself frozen.
No longer in relationships,

414
00:23:33,011 --> 00:23:36,850
aren't able to do anything really
miserable in early thirties that's how she

415
00:23:36,851 --> 00:23:39,940
comes along. What do I do? Well,
antidepressants might help a bit,

416
00:23:39,941 --> 00:23:41,500
but actually something else going on.

417
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:45,470
So we try to understand the story the
right back to the beginning of a story

418
00:23:45,471 --> 00:23:47,520
inside the red box.
We've,

419
00:23:47,570 --> 00:23:51,950
it turns out she has parents who
really were quite critical of her.

420
00:23:51,950 --> 00:23:56,570
They were rejected her and were quite
demanding of her and she felt in response

421
00:23:56,571 --> 00:23:58,940
to a parish,
she felt very guilty about it.

422
00:23:58,941 --> 00:24:01,460
But she also tried to work really hard.
So she's in the red box there.

423
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:05,010
She's striving and needy.
Her needs aren't being met by a parent.

424
00:24:05,011 --> 00:24:08,510
She's quite independent.
She's also quite rebellious school.

425
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:12,080
So there she's at school as a young girl,
she actually gets expelled.

426
00:24:12,081 --> 00:24:15,720
So if you look on the side that rebel
gets rejected and you see that she has,

427
00:24:15,721 --> 00:24:18,770
she gets expelled from school,
which just makes it feel worse.

428
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:23,930
So she longs for closeness cause she's a,
she's a, she's a attractive young woman,

429
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:28,430
makes us his relationships. He often has
relationships. She feels abandonment.

430
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:31,100
She's in the center now.
She feels abandoned.

431
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:35,530
She avoids getting close to
her boyfriends. She feels
very lonely. She withdraws,

432
00:24:35,531 --> 00:24:37,400
draw people and needs are of an unmet.

433
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,890
She feels depressed and she
feels like a frozen chicken.

434
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:41,840
She doesn't dare reveal herself.

435
00:24:42,530 --> 00:24:46,790
So she sometimes on the other side on the
left with left or right this side here,

436
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:48,800
she risks becoming closer to people.

437
00:24:48,801 --> 00:24:51,560
He tends to idealize the
person she falls in love with.

438
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:55,940
She makes them out to be perfect, has an
eye, a moment of complete being in love.

439
00:24:55,941 --> 00:25:00,260
They're perfect relationship.
She then feels totally, uh, she,

440
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:03,330
she feels been worthwhile,
but she feels being a gardener,

441
00:25:03,331 --> 00:25:04,430
she run runs away again.

442
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:07,700
She can't cope with the idea of being
abandoned and she's back to the frozen

443
00:25:07,701 --> 00:25:12,650
chicken sometimes on the other side
he strives very hard to please people.

444
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:17,150
She pretends to be something he isn't.
She hates herself. Her needs are unmet.

445
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:19,760
She doesn't reveal itself.
And then she feels depressed.

446
00:25:20,330 --> 00:25:23,360
So if like this is a joint
collaborative formulation,

447
00:25:23,361 --> 00:25:27,110
we've made it the kind of problems
that she has. That's a formulation.

448
00:25:27,650 --> 00:25:29,180
Another example formulation here,

449
00:25:29,181 --> 00:25:31,970
this was a man called Terri
who is to drink too much.

450
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:35,900
He had very can inside the red box
red circle. He had very rejecting,

451
00:25:35,901 --> 00:25:37,720
abandoning parents who
are very contemporary,

452
00:25:37,721 --> 00:25:41,540
sort of him as a child is in a place of B.
He's very lone,

453
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:45,590
felt his needs for closeness,
wanting was very, was contemptible.

454
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:47,390
And what we find in live as you,

455
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:51,440
you often tend to reproduce
psychologically some of
the things your parents did

456
00:25:51,441 --> 00:25:55,400
to you in your judgments.
So he to himself was very rejecting.

457
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:59,990
He were angry with himself. What he
tends to do again, have, uh, he would,

458
00:26:00,050 --> 00:26:03,530
he would, he, he was easy. He
worked, he worked in the industry.

459
00:26:03,950 --> 00:26:05,480
What you would find is that one,

460
00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:07,820
because he was quite contemptuous
and angry with people,

461
00:26:07,970 --> 00:26:09,650
he looked around his peers.

462
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:12,830
They often find that other people weren't
as good as him. So they're always,

463
00:26:12,831 --> 00:26:15,380
he would say to other people,
other people were, he's the,

464
00:26:15,381 --> 00:26:18,370
he's the best of the people will be
better than him and he will do reject all

465
00:26:18,371 --> 00:26:21,380
the people. Not surprisingly,
when he did that,

466
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:25,880
as we will reject him and he will
be then end up being very lonely.

467
00:26:26,030 --> 00:26:28,040
And in fact,
what he ended up doing was drinking.

468
00:26:28,041 --> 00:26:31,700
So he would end up being very depressed.
You turn, he was on the worst person,

469
00:26:31,701 --> 00:26:32,870
the world and the drink.

470
00:26:33,170 --> 00:26:38,170
So He'd have a pattern of being
contemptuous of others and contemptuous of

471
00:26:38,271 --> 00:26:41,180
himself. And he will reduce that.
He would reproduce a pattern.

472
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:43,530
When we analyze his
relationships with others,

473
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:46,380
he would constantly feel he was
either the best or the worst.

474
00:26:46,381 --> 00:26:49,740
He had one way of thinking about people.
He had to be the best of something.

475
00:26:49,741 --> 00:26:52,680
Or the worst is something.
He was always winning awards at work.

476
00:26:52,890 --> 00:26:55,340
And then he'd win awards.
He get, he'd have, he'd,

477
00:26:55,341 --> 00:26:59,280
he'd boasts and other people would
then reject him and they didn't end up

478
00:26:59,281 --> 00:27:01,260
drinking. Um, and it was a pattern.

479
00:27:01,261 --> 00:27:04,050
He went round and round and round and
you'd find it very difficult to accept

480
00:27:04,051 --> 00:27:05,220
himself as he was.

481
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:09,070
So that's the kind of formulation we
might draw up in collaboration with a

482
00:27:09,071 --> 00:27:12,660
patient. And then following
a formulation like that,

483
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:15,720
we would then introduce ways of change.
So for example,

484
00:27:15,721 --> 00:27:17,040
if you look at this lady here,

485
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:22,850
we then talked about her sense of being
rejected by others. Why, what, what,

486
00:27:22,851 --> 00:27:25,800
what was about her, which
was, which wasn't worthy,

487
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:30,300
why she was avoiding closeness and try
to help her to accept herself more and

488
00:27:30,301 --> 00:27:33,930
gradually therefore to stop
idealizing demand. She met,

489
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:37,740
we should go into a completely over the
top relationship where she'd want to

490
00:27:37,741 --> 00:27:39,090
move in the day she met them.

491
00:27:39,270 --> 00:27:41,960
And they will then run away from
a helper to be a little more,

492
00:27:41,990 --> 00:27:45,540
more careful about the relationships
he got into and gradually develop

493
00:27:45,541 --> 00:27:50,160
relationships where she could be with
people not as perfect without them being

494
00:27:50,161 --> 00:27:52,650
perfect,
but more egalitarian relationship.

495
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:58,130
And again with Terri to help him to not
be so contemptuous of others because the

496
00:27:58,531 --> 00:28:01,860
partner got into was always
to push other people to have,

497
00:28:01,861 --> 00:28:05,590
which meant they put him down. So that's
what you might do in your, in your,

498
00:28:05,610 --> 00:28:08,230
in your, in your treatment. So I say the,

499
00:28:08,231 --> 00:28:11,480
that's quite a different approach
from giving someone antidepressants.

500
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:15,210
So we might well work with antidepressants
as say if somebody is filling

501
00:28:15,211 --> 00:28:19,890
depression, depression, what
the challenges are is how
scientific is all of us.

502
00:28:19,910 --> 00:28:21,690
You may say,
well what Scott got to do with science,

503
00:28:21,691 --> 00:28:24,100
we try to be sounds practitioners will,

504
00:28:24,101 --> 00:28:27,300
it's based on studies which
you've used models like this to,

505
00:28:27,301 --> 00:28:31,550
they worked and they work. And so a lot
of evidence the CBT is effective as,

506
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:36,460
as I mentioned. Uh, and so when there's a
loss of, of have worked on what are the,

507
00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:37,740
what are the,
what are the studies,

508
00:28:37,741 --> 00:28:41,520
what does this treatment work just
well with which patients does it work?

509
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:46,940
And one of the problems we have in
psychiatry and psychology is that actually

510
00:28:46,951 --> 00:28:50,790
humans are terribly, very, everybody
in this room has a different story.

511
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:55,650
Doing psychological research is
complicated because you all have different

512
00:28:55,651 --> 00:28:56,640
experiences.

513
00:28:57,030 --> 00:29:01,210
Whereas probably most of your kidneys
or livers work kind of the same mama the

514
00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:05,100
mansion. But your history is your
psychology is going to be so different.

515
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:09,900
And we've tended to give one treatment
to everybody and what the research

516
00:29:10,050 --> 00:29:14,070
demands is that we have more and more
nuanced treatments for different people.

517
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:17,070
You wouldn't want the same treatment as
the person next to you cause your life

518
00:29:17,071 --> 00:29:18,180
story is different.

519
00:29:18,510 --> 00:29:22,530
And that's why often we don't get it
right cause it's very typical to get it

520
00:29:22,531 --> 00:29:25,860
right. Um, laws, medicine if like,

521
00:29:25,890 --> 00:29:29,580
I like to say that there are difficult
subjects are probably simply because

522
00:29:29,581 --> 00:29:31,200
people are not so different.

523
00:29:31,201 --> 00:29:34,710
I mean there are many ways in which you
can be physically ill and break the law

524
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:37,680
and do have legal complications.

525
00:29:37,890 --> 00:29:40,920
But if you like the numbers of ways in
which people relate to each other is

526
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:45,340
infinitely complicated. It's difficult.
And we do our best to be scientific,

527
00:29:45,341 --> 00:29:47,190
but we don't always get it right.
Uh,

528
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:51,130
therefore we do spend a lot
of time thinking about it
and sometimes we get over

529
00:29:51,131 --> 00:29:54,790
reflective and we spend our time thinking
and maybe that's not always helpful.

530
00:29:55,990 --> 00:29:59,260
There are not so many of us because it's
very expensive to train somebody to, to,

531
00:29:59,261 --> 00:30:02,860
to, to, to become a clinical psychologist,
several hundreds of thousands.

532
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:07,690
And so the stuff you like the NHS can't
afford that many and we tend to be

533
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:11,910
relatively few of us. So I don't know
how many of you ever actually had,

534
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:12,790
just out of interest,

535
00:30:13,150 --> 00:30:17,910
how many few have heard of clinical
psychologists as a professional high?

536
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:21,550
You've heard of us? Great. But I,
I, but, but, but probably not many.

537
00:30:21,551 --> 00:30:25,840
How many you actually no
clinical psychologists
personally, but for five years.

538
00:30:25,870 --> 00:30:29,830
Okay. And that's, that's great that you
do. Um, there are not many. It's a many,

539
00:30:29,831 --> 00:30:33,310
many more psychiatrists. I can't
trust some much more numerous than us.

540
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:37,270
And of course, many, many, many, many
more doctors. Um, there are many not more.

541
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:41,800
Most mental health care, certainly in
the UK is provided through the NHS.

542
00:30:42,010 --> 00:30:45,220
It's provided by nurses and
doctors were very swollen number.

543
00:30:45,610 --> 00:30:49,060
And so how can we have these
models are very interesting,

544
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:52,290
but it's hard to,
to actually see somebody,

545
00:30:52,310 --> 00:30:56,300
the chances of seeing a
clinical psychologist are
really quite small because

546
00:30:56,301 --> 00:30:58,480
there was so few of us.
Um,

547
00:30:58,810 --> 00:31:03,120
and one of the other things is
that we know very well that the,

548
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:07,060
the things that often precipitate the
background to mental health problems in

549
00:31:07,061 --> 00:31:11,990
particular are things like
poverty and, um, and, and, and,

550
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:13,270
and exclusion.

551
00:31:13,570 --> 00:31:18,570
So we know that mental health problems
are much more dominant within groups that

552
00:31:18,581 --> 00:31:22,120
have poor resources. Um, and if you like,

553
00:31:22,121 --> 00:31:25,540
if you want to improve the mental
health of the nation as a whole,

554
00:31:25,690 --> 00:31:30,430
you might want to pay more attention
to things like education and, and,

555
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:34,780
and employment, unemployment
and so on, uh, and inequalities.

556
00:31:35,230 --> 00:31:39,070
Um, and we are looking, we are looking
at the individual victims, if you like,

557
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:43,190
we get the people who have been
damaged by some of those things. Um,

558
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:46,570
and maybe a better thing
would be to change society
as a whole because those are

559
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:50,800
the things that lead to some of the
mental health problems that there are. Um,

560
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:54,490
we're, we're fixing the individuals.
I appreciate you have to do both.

561
00:31:54,491 --> 00:31:57,940
But often there's a tension
between should we treat the people,

562
00:31:57,941 --> 00:32:02,170
should we try and change the system, which
leads to people having these problems.

563
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:05,530
We can talk more about that.
And so I'm,

564
00:32:05,531 --> 00:32:09,130
one of the other things is could we
make you make much more better use of

565
00:32:09,131 --> 00:32:12,550
individual and information technology,
the treatments,

566
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:16,990
purely CBT treatments that,
that um, are increasingly used.

567
00:32:17,590 --> 00:32:21,400
There are open to being used
with technology. For example,

568
00:32:21,401 --> 00:32:24,090
some of the individual treatments
around coming to see me to do a,

569
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:28,330
a desensitization, which is a treatment
for your fear of lifts or something.

570
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:33,040
Could you do that online? And there are
treatments which can be provided online.

571
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:36,880
I had a go at this myself actually a few
years ago because there's a very good

572
00:32:36,881 --> 00:32:41,600
program for people who have
sleep problems called um, calm,

573
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:46,040
sleepy. Thank you. Cool. Sleepier
which is an a CBT online treatment. Um,

574
00:32:46,041 --> 00:32:49,150
it's right in fact set up by a colleague
of mine from Glasgow University.

575
00:32:49,151 --> 00:32:51,980
Now in Oxford. I don't have a major
sleep problem, but I thought, well,

576
00:32:51,981 --> 00:32:56,570
I quite fancy you though. Sleeping a bit
better. So I did the sleep program, um,

577
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:58,340
which meant I had to go every week.

578
00:32:58,341 --> 00:33:02,210
I had to go online and about an hour and
ask questions and do things differently

579
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:05,900
and it was very well designed and
actually I have to say really did work.

580
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:08,930
It increased my ability to sleep well
through the night and it was very nice.

581
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:12,150
Then tribals I kind of stepped back
into my bad habits after a while,

582
00:33:12,151 --> 00:33:14,800
which is reading in the middle
of the night things and, and,

583
00:33:14,810 --> 00:33:16,040
and stuff and stay in bed light,

584
00:33:16,041 --> 00:33:19,300
which you shouldn't do if you've
got sleep problems. But um, yeah,

585
00:33:19,310 --> 00:33:23,390
we should use information technology
better to try and spread if you like

586
00:33:23,391 --> 00:33:27,470
psychological treatments to more people
and there are ways of doing that. Um,

587
00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:32,300
it's very much what, what I think next
generation is going to include. Um,

588
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:37,000
so I think that that starts the next,
I've been sharing his here,

589
00:33:37,001 --> 00:33:38,660
I'm macdougal thinking with you,

590
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:42,140
thinking about what can we do to
spread good mental health practice.

591
00:33:42,470 --> 00:33:45,950
We know that depression is a
major cause of dysfunction in,

592
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:49,310
in the world out there.
Most of us in our lifetime,

593
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:54,020
we'll have either ourselves or one of
our friends and family will have some

594
00:33:54,021 --> 00:33:58,490
mental health problem and it will cause
distress to farmers and we can treat it

595
00:33:58,491 --> 00:33:58,971
medically,

596
00:33:58,971 --> 00:34:03,500
although not everybody responds to
medication and in many ways having what we

597
00:34:03,501 --> 00:34:06,650
know is that psychological treatment
and medical treatment together as one of

598
00:34:06,651 --> 00:34:11,300
the best, but it's hugely time consuming
and it's demanding and it's expensive,

599
00:34:11,570 --> 00:34:16,280
so it's somewhere in which we could
deliver better treatment better.

600
00:34:16,550 --> 00:34:19,400
One of the things that makes it difficult
is that one of the things we know is

601
00:34:19,401 --> 00:34:23,270
important in making a psychological
treatment work is relationship that you

602
00:34:23,271 --> 00:34:25,670
develop with the person who were helping.

603
00:34:25,970 --> 00:34:28,490
So that's very important that
we have a close relationship.

604
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:32,840
How can you reproduce a
relationship with a computer?

605
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:36,500
Because we know that that bombed the
person who goes up and down the lift with

606
00:34:36,501 --> 00:34:36,800
me.

607
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:41,580
The reason she's prepared to do it is
we spent several hours beforehand where

608
00:34:41,581 --> 00:34:44,510
I've listened to her, I've given
her my tension, she trusts me,

609
00:34:44,630 --> 00:34:49,490
she knows that I respect her and not
belittling her and I'm therefore so she

610
00:34:49,491 --> 00:34:51,290
trusts me in order to try doing it.

611
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:55,850
How could you do that if you like on a
computer? So that's one of our challenges.

612
00:34:55,851 --> 00:34:59,960
How to deliver more widely the mental
health struggles that we have to people.

613
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:02,380
I think I've probably talked enough.

614
00:35:02,381 --> 00:35:07,340
I was off talk about the two mature I've
done so I'm be more than happy to take

615
00:35:07,341 --> 00:35:10,580
the conversation further in any
direction and people will be interested.

616
00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:15,470
Some real patterns on the trunk.
It's an educational psychologist,

617
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:17,630
same as a clinical psychologist,

618
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:20,570
but thank you for asthma and I probably
should have clarified when you turn your

619
00:35:20,571 --> 00:35:24,770
first degree, as I mentioned, all that,
those subjects you either you can just,

620
00:35:24,771 --> 00:35:27,140
that's the degree. It could have
been history or physics or something.

621
00:35:27,141 --> 00:35:31,640
Go and work for Google or something that
uses psychology again or you can come

622
00:35:31,641 --> 00:35:34,820
at applied psychologists and they're
about seven branches of psychology,

623
00:35:34,821 --> 00:35:38,160
which are applied. One is clinical.
That was a bit I wanted to do.

624
00:35:38,370 --> 00:35:41,700
One is you mentioned educational.
There are things like occupational,

625
00:35:41,701 --> 00:35:45,700
which is helping design
workplaces and things. Um,

626
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:48,780
educational is particularly
working with children in schools,

627
00:35:48,781 --> 00:35:50,720
how children learn and uh,

628
00:35:50,850 --> 00:35:55,530
looking in particular at
family difficulties so that
if you are interested in,

629
00:35:55,770 --> 00:35:59,940
in how to be affect how dyslexia
and how children behave in schools.

630
00:36:00,090 --> 00:36:03,180
That's narrowed to go into.
Whereas what I trained,

631
00:36:03,210 --> 00:36:06,990
where I trained with lot within the NHS
in clinical settings, hospitals, settings,

632
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:11,670
um, education psychologist. So,
so I often do teaching first.

633
00:36:11,671 --> 00:36:15,810
So they're very familiar with the
education system before they start working

634
00:36:15,811 --> 00:36:18,330
with teachers about how to work.
Cause I worked in hospital,

635
00:36:18,331 --> 00:36:22,380
I worked in the NHS as a, an assistant
occupational therapist for a bit.

636
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,690
So I got used to feel like
how the hospitals work,

637
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:27,320
how the doctors had teams work.
So you know,

638
00:36:27,330 --> 00:36:32,070
the workplace actually psychologists would
use many of the same models like CBT.

639
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:35,580
So our theory is that the same,
it's the workplace. It is different.

640
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,680
But thanks for that question.
And it was

641
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:41,713
um,

642
00:36:41,970 --> 00:36:46,020
I wanted to ask about widespread models,

643
00:36:46,021 --> 00:36:49,290
I guess in my wife's per processes
because of course depression, anxiety,

644
00:36:49,291 --> 00:36:51,690
they come from things such as maybe,
oh,

645
00:36:51,691 --> 00:36:55,080
they stem from skills like
resilience and things like that.

646
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:57,990
Do you know if they're doing such,
you know,

647
00:36:58,030 --> 00:37:01,950
what resilience course at schools
nowadays? It's interesting. Yes.

648
00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:05,610
Because indeed w I think
very important contracts.

649
00:37:05,611 --> 00:37:10,200
Although when you experienced depression,
anxiety, you think it's you because you,

650
00:37:10,201 --> 00:37:13,650
you know, obviously that's
how you experience it. It
is indeed your, your life,

651
00:37:13,651 --> 00:37:16,620
which is yeah,
which is in disorder or discomfort,

652
00:37:16,890 --> 00:37:18,360
but you're not alone
and many other people,

653
00:37:18,370 --> 00:37:23,370
same issues and things like stress and
the demands are commuting and the demands

654
00:37:23,431 --> 00:37:27,240
of managing workplace and the family
and all that stuff as all this ads.

655
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:29,550
And you're, yes, the context is important.

656
00:37:29,551 --> 00:37:33,000
So could we do something about that
context to reduce some of that stuff?

657
00:37:33,570 --> 00:37:37,440
And because the real world in which we
are all competing and the demands is

658
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:39,030
difficult to change all of that.

659
00:37:39,031 --> 00:37:41,160
And as we all go and give
up live in the countryside.

660
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:44,040
But assuming we don't do that
kind of workplace, do something,

661
00:37:44,041 --> 00:37:48,240
can schools do something? One of the,
one of the, the kind of fashionable, um,

662
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:52,530
ideas is mindfulness. What mindfulness
is a way people have heard of that.

663
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:56,790
It's a way of trying to help you to get
away from particular critical thoughts

664
00:37:57,180 --> 00:38:00,000
and the underlying model
why mindfulness works.

665
00:38:00,001 --> 00:38:03,960
And they are teaching this in schools
now and maybe in workplaces it's like

666
00:38:03,961 --> 00:38:07,530
relaxation. It's helping you to
get off the tray, the treadmill.

667
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:12,020
So if you look at the, um, I feel
like, uh, this, this poor person here,

668
00:38:12,030 --> 00:38:15,600
she was in a treadmill because
people don't want to be unhappy.

669
00:38:15,601 --> 00:38:19,020
We sometimes all she, she's her own
worst enemy. She makes it, she wants to,

670
00:38:19,050 --> 00:38:22,350
she doesn't want to get better. It's
not that you don't want to get better,

671
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:27,150
you don't know how to change. So change
is very scary because if you always do,

672
00:38:27,230 --> 00:38:30,240
if you always walk in the same way,
someone asked you to walk differently,

673
00:38:30,390 --> 00:38:33,810
how do you do that? It's really hard
and we shouldn't underestimate that.

674
00:38:34,170 --> 00:38:39,170
So what mindfulness on these trainings
try to do is to help you to get off the

675
00:38:39,281 --> 00:38:43,840
treadmill that you're on and think or
think about it differently. So yes,

676
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:46,810
there is an attempt to do that and then
that is going to be a better way of

677
00:38:46,811 --> 00:38:47,740
solving problems.

678
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:51,850
But it's such a huge thing and it's what
we know is that mindfulness does work

679
00:38:51,851 --> 00:38:54,040
to a degree,
but then again it's not good enough yet.

680
00:38:54,070 --> 00:38:55,450
We still don't have a panacea.

681
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:02,253
Okay.

682
00:39:05,790 --> 00:39:09,060
Again, the evidence, the
evidence shows that it has a,

683
00:39:09,061 --> 00:39:11,320
some small effect.
I can't,

684
00:39:11,510 --> 00:39:15,210
they evidence on teaching mindfulness
in schools is for some children it is

685
00:39:15,211 --> 00:39:19,560
helpful but not for all of them policies,
difficult to engage all the kids in it.

686
00:39:19,950 --> 00:39:22,650
Um, so yes, the evidence is
that it wasn't, again, using,

687
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:26,790
trying to be scientist about it works.
Some people some of the time and we're,

688
00:39:26,791 --> 00:39:28,330
we're on the case,
but with,

689
00:39:28,450 --> 00:39:31,680
there isn't a solution to everything
yet cause it's cause it's complex.

690
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:36,030
So I know that's not a good story to
tell. I'd love to say yes, but it's not,

691
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:39,460
we don't know yet.
Somebody here had something.

692
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:41,273
Hmm.

693
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:43,570
Thank you.
I was wondering,

694
00:39:43,571 --> 00:39:48,571
how do clinical psychology practitioners
deal with all the kind of the heavy

695
00:39:48,851 --> 00:39:52,420
information and the whole kind
of difficult stories after work?

696
00:39:52,750 --> 00:39:54,400
How they decompress?
I deal with it.

697
00:39:54,940 --> 00:39:58,120
I think it's very interesting and
increasingly we're getting a bit better at

698
00:39:58,121 --> 00:40:02,650
that than we were. Um, I, I mentioned
one of our skills as being reflective.

699
00:40:02,651 --> 00:40:03,760
How reflective should we be?

700
00:40:04,030 --> 00:40:07,240
Everybody in practice is
supposed to have a supervisor,

701
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:08,860
which doesn't mean someone
to tell you what to do.

702
00:40:08,861 --> 00:40:12,280
It's somebody you can go and
talk to about things. Um, and I,

703
00:40:12,281 --> 00:40:16,550
it is in a sense, it's like,
like being a doctor, you,

704
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:21,220
you kind of get used to it. And I, I, I
have to say that, that, uh, of my life,

705
00:40:21,221 --> 00:40:24,230
I think I've become a bit inured
to stories that people tell me.

706
00:40:24,231 --> 00:40:26,860
And sometimes I think I'm getting hard
hearted because there isn't too much

707
00:40:26,861 --> 00:40:29,890
horrible stuff I have not heard of.
You do get used to it.

708
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:33,310
The thing that I find quite difficult,
so when I was first working,

709
00:40:34,270 --> 00:40:37,180
one of the big issues are
talked about trauma. Um,

710
00:40:37,210 --> 00:40:41,740
one of the things we know for example
is that childhood abuse and neglect and

711
00:40:41,741 --> 00:40:44,080
abandonment as a child is,
is bad for you.

712
00:40:44,081 --> 00:40:46,900
We know that having an unhappy
childhood is not good for you.

713
00:40:46,930 --> 00:40:50,130
That's the one statement I can make.
Um,

714
00:40:50,350 --> 00:40:54,970
and when you hear stories about how
children have been harmed by society or by

715
00:40:54,971 --> 00:40:57,940
families, that's very difficult. I used
to find that really hard to hear that.

716
00:40:58,300 --> 00:40:59,860
Absolutely.
We don't have my own children.

717
00:40:59,861 --> 00:41:03,280
I was hearing stories about children
and abuse. That was difficult. We do,

718
00:41:03,310 --> 00:41:07,420
we do have the audio is you have somebody
who's been through it before and I

719
00:41:07,421 --> 00:41:12,100
think you kind of get you focused on
what to do about it rather than going on

720
00:41:12,101 --> 00:41:15,190
about it. Again, we tend not to
talk too much about the past.

721
00:41:15,191 --> 00:41:16,600
We're talking about how things are,

722
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:20,110
how things are playing out now
because you can't change the past.

723
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:25,030
What is happening now today
in your relationships,
which maybe we could change.

724
00:41:25,330 --> 00:41:27,430
For example, one of things
we found about people who've,

725
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:32,260
who've been abused children is not that
they abuse others because they often

726
00:41:32,290 --> 00:41:32,941
they don't.

727
00:41:32,941 --> 00:41:36,230
So a myth sometimes that they do what
they do is they abuse themselves.

728
00:41:36,231 --> 00:41:40,310
So often they attack themselves
rather than attack anybody else.

729
00:41:40,490 --> 00:41:45,070
So that's what you want to work with is
people self harming and self if that's

730
00:41:45,110 --> 00:41:48,020
psychological harming rather
than going into the past.

731
00:41:48,021 --> 00:41:50,660
So I think you hear it then you say,
what do we do about it now?

732
00:41:51,590 --> 00:41:53,030
So you kind of a hopeful where out of it.

733
00:41:54,270 --> 00:41:55,410
It's very sounds.

734
00:41:57,460 --> 00:41:58,293
So,
um,

735
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:03,030
what do you think the biggest differences
between approaches to clinical

736
00:42:03,031 --> 00:42:07,440
psychology? Um, in the US and the UK are?

737
00:42:08,050 --> 00:42:09,610
That's interesting
because I'm my colleagues,

738
00:42:09,750 --> 00:42:14,080
you know who work in the UK and I
did spend a couple of months in, in,

739
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:18,180
in uh, in University of Florida
and looking at the system,

740
00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:22,450
the health system there, I'm not
that experienced, but you know what,

741
00:42:22,451 --> 00:42:26,110
I understand one of the big differences
it because we're NHS based clinical

742
00:42:26,111 --> 00:42:28,200
psychology, pine lodge, we,

743
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:32,230
we tend to have shorter treatments
because of the cost of treatment and we,

744
00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:36,820
so we were very much evidence based, what
is it, the works in the shortest time.

745
00:42:37,210 --> 00:42:39,790
So there's more pressure
to do things more quickly.

746
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:43,090
Tends to be there for CBT
is the model of choice.

747
00:42:43,270 --> 00:42:46,150
Whereas in the U s is more
psychodynamic therapist,

748
00:42:46,270 --> 00:42:49,690
which is more Freud in
based or relationship based
which take a bit longer.

749
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:53,920
The evidence is there equally helpful
but they take longer so that's a

750
00:42:53,921 --> 00:42:57,700
difference. We notice that's
the most obvious difference.

751
00:42:59,830 --> 00:43:03,730
Somebody, lots of pants.
Good. I like this.

752
00:43:06,210 --> 00:43:09,050
What do you expect in years to come?

753
00:43:09,110 --> 00:43:14,110
There'll be lots of things in your
redbox associated with social media and

754
00:43:14,121 --> 00:43:16,790
social media pressures,
particularly on adolescents.

755
00:43:17,260 --> 00:43:22,030
Yeah, that's very interesting
cause I think what you are,

756
00:43:22,031 --> 00:43:27,031
one is humans are enormous influence by
people around them and and your close

757
00:43:27,491 --> 00:43:30,220
relationships, your parents, your
friends are very important to you.

758
00:43:30,430 --> 00:43:34,210
Especially for adolescents.
They, there's a huge,

759
00:43:34,530 --> 00:43:37,060
when the press is separation from parents,

760
00:43:37,870 --> 00:43:40,510
we are assumes we need
attachments to others.

761
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:45,960
Separation process from your parents means
you start to attach to clean the teen

762
00:43:46,031 --> 00:43:47,380
years to your peer group.

763
00:43:47,710 --> 00:43:51,970
If your peer group is a perfect peer
group on social media who all look

764
00:43:51,971 --> 00:43:54,850
fantastic, good parties all
the time and have a great time,

765
00:43:55,060 --> 00:43:58,870
but your not that teaches you,
you're not a very worthwhile person.

766
00:43:59,140 --> 00:44:02,500
So I think yes, I do see that as a
problem and particularly for adolescents,

767
00:44:02,501 --> 00:44:06,510
we know that mental health of young
people today is getting worse and,

768
00:44:06,700 --> 00:44:07,750
and I suspect,

769
00:44:07,751 --> 00:44:11,590
but I don't know well enough
what the evidences of a
social psychologist to come.

770
00:44:11,591 --> 00:44:13,930
We work, you know, the evidence
is on social media stories

771
00:44:24,490 --> 00:44:25,700
really bad.
Um,

772
00:44:26,150 --> 00:44:31,150
and it's a mixture of these social
comparisons that normally if you like,

773
00:44:32,671 --> 00:44:36,880
that's within a group of 25,
uh,

774
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:41,910
suddenly you've got 700,000 to make
your comparisons with and guess what,

775
00:44:41,911 --> 00:44:44,310
you come out badly.
Um,

776
00:44:44,490 --> 00:44:49,490
and the other thing is that he will behave
worse to each other when they are not

777
00:44:49,981 --> 00:44:53,970
face to face. It's an image. Um, uh,

778
00:44:54,030 --> 00:44:59,030
people do much nastier things to each
other over social media than they would

779
00:44:59,131 --> 00:45:03,160
face to face.
So those two facts naked,

780
00:45:03,210 --> 00:45:07,770
a very dangerous place to be,
even though it's got lots of positives.

781
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:13,400
I think the programs, there's teaching
people how to use social media because it,

782
00:45:13,420 --> 00:45:17,200
I'm certainly, when I'm, I
don't use Facebook. Whenever
I see anything, I think,

783
00:45:17,201 --> 00:45:19,450
Oh God, these people having
much more fun than I'm having.

784
00:45:20,290 --> 00:45:23,260
But of course it's all myth and story.
I know that. But it's hard when you're,

785
00:45:23,380 --> 00:45:26,200
when you're young. How do you
know that? For sure. So yes,

786
00:45:26,350 --> 00:45:28,090
I think that's one of the
boxes you would put in there,

787
00:45:28,091 --> 00:45:33,091
which is the world around you is much
more likely to be a less comfortable place

788
00:45:33,281 --> 00:45:36,220
to be when you're just a little
you for the oil, a little problems.

789
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:37,900
So I think that's,
that's certainly true.

790
00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:42,820
And I think that helping people to ways
of dealing with that and understanding

791
00:45:42,821 --> 00:45:45,460
the, of course you put, you spend
hours making the perfect selfie.

792
00:45:45,461 --> 00:45:49,990
Most of us don't look like that most of
the time. So yes. I'm sure that's true.

793
00:45:51,180 --> 00:45:52,013
Eh,

794
00:45:52,210 --> 00:45:57,010
you've mentioned the relationship
between the therapist and therapy.

795
00:45:57,430 --> 00:46:00,190
Uh, how do you deal with, uh,

796
00:46:00,250 --> 00:46:03,670
people that kind of get addicted to your,
to the relationship,

797
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:07,990
relying more on their therapy then
solving their problems on their own?

798
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:11,650
Yes, it's ranging issue because one
of the things you're doing when you,

799
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:14,350
a patient comes and tell with that client,
which have a word you're using,

800
00:46:14,530 --> 00:46:18,760
we use both comes to see you and tells
you they feel like their difficulties.

801
00:46:19,180 --> 00:46:20,013
Um,

802
00:46:20,020 --> 00:46:23,650
my professional job is to listen to the
person and give them my full attention

803
00:46:23,860 --> 00:46:24,790
and understand them.

804
00:46:24,940 --> 00:46:28,630
So I'm giving them a lot of sort
of cues that I'm there for them.

805
00:46:30,010 --> 00:46:32,980
We have to very careful that's not
misunderstood and the relationship because

806
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:35,930
normally when you sit on your own with
somebody in the room and they're paying

807
00:46:35,950 --> 00:46:40,540
really good attention for an
hour or something, um, that,
that uh, that's very nice,

808
00:46:40,541 --> 00:46:43,380
experienced. We listened to being
valued, especially if the person,

809
00:46:43,390 --> 00:46:47,020
I was very few other places where
they are experienced as valued,

810
00:46:47,530 --> 00:46:51,520
which is why it's very important that we
have a lot of signals and signs around,

811
00:46:51,790 --> 00:46:54,550
which is this is, uh, this is
a professional relationship,

812
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:56,200
is not a personal relationship.

813
00:46:56,230 --> 00:47:01,230
And there's always that difficulty at
some point where the person may start to,

814
00:47:02,950 --> 00:47:05,080
to wish they had a
personal relationship with.

815
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:09,160
I've certainly had people want to ask
me out to dinner and people have got,

816
00:47:09,220 --> 00:47:09,910
you know,

817
00:47:09,910 --> 00:47:14,690
t wanted more personal relationship and
that's understandable because you've

818
00:47:14,700 --> 00:47:18,340
being terribly nice to them and you're
listening to them and being there for

819
00:47:18,341 --> 00:47:21,490
them. But again, it's very important
that your vote also very clear.

820
00:47:21,491 --> 00:47:24,520
It's why we often use our professional
titles and we only see people in

821
00:47:24,521 --> 00:47:29,290
consulting rooms. This is not a
social space, this is a workspace.

822
00:47:29,620 --> 00:47:32,890
And all the time you're helping
them to understand that this is a,

823
00:47:32,910 --> 00:47:36,700
this is a way of talking
about your problems. This
isn't solving your problems.

824
00:47:37,150 --> 00:47:40,930
Problems are up there. We're going to
help you get back out there. Again,

825
00:47:40,931 --> 00:47:44,260
this is limited and we also often
talk about time limits. So we'll say,

826
00:47:44,510 --> 00:47:48,220
I'm gonna see you for six sessions. And
we may, in some models we actually say,

827
00:47:48,221 --> 00:47:48,581
well,
you know,

828
00:47:48,581 --> 00:47:51,370
we count down the session so they
know it's going to come to an end.

829
00:47:51,730 --> 00:47:55,360
But it's a very good, and going back
to the, to the question about the USA,

830
00:47:55,690 --> 00:47:58,990
where you work in a more psychodynamic
model forward your model,

831
00:47:59,020 --> 00:48:02,620
that model where you have a longer
term relationship that can be more

832
00:48:02,621 --> 00:48:05,770
problematic and is part of our
training tart to handle that.

833
00:48:06,070 --> 00:48:09,370
And it's understandable why people
can get dependent cause you know,

834
00:48:09,490 --> 00:48:12,010
that happens.
And the other thing is some,

835
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:16,810
some of some many training also require
you to have experience of therapy.

836
00:48:16,930 --> 00:48:18,920
So you as a therapist can go,

837
00:48:19,870 --> 00:48:24,870
part of your training is to be a patient
and you then discover how easy it is to

838
00:48:25,601 --> 00:48:29,230
idealize the person or to stop rehearsing
what you tell them and tell them that

839
00:48:29,470 --> 00:48:32,830
partly true story and not holds true story
because you're worried about that one.

840
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:35,200
Yeah. So it sounded good. That
was a good way of handling it.

841
00:48:39,970 --> 00:48:41,290
The clinical body Nice.

842
00:48:41,291 --> 00:48:46,210
Have to make really difficult decisions
about how they allocate resources. Uh,

843
00:48:46,211 --> 00:48:46,481
you know,

844
00:48:46,481 --> 00:48:50,550
we can't afford this particular medicine
for this group of people given there

845
00:48:50,551 --> 00:48:52,960
are so few of you,
I was just interested to know how,

846
00:48:53,350 --> 00:48:56,770
how is it triaged in terms of
who's going to get treatment?

847
00:48:56,900 --> 00:49:01,670
Yes. There's national [inaudible] National
Institute of Clinical Excellence, um,

848
00:49:01,700 --> 00:49:05,430
which will provide a, because that's the
right acronym isn't it? No, mostly yeah,

849
00:49:05,690 --> 00:49:06,500
they,
they,

850
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:11,150
they provide guidance on what treatments
they do recommend psychological

851
00:49:11,151 --> 00:49:15,850
treatments, um, for a number
of different, uh, uh, call, uh,

852
00:49:16,340 --> 00:49:20,140
conditions, um, based on evidence. And
again, quite rightly better than evidence.

853
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:21,440
If I have treatment,

854
00:49:21,441 --> 00:49:24,560
I want to know that is it is the right
treatment for my particular condition.

855
00:49:25,100 --> 00:49:29,210
They, they do recommend then for example,
one of these, we known psychosis.

856
00:49:29,211 --> 00:49:32,270
I mentioned psychosis. When people
have major mental health problems,

857
00:49:32,271 --> 00:49:37,271
hallucinations and delusions that the
evidence shows that if you provide

858
00:49:37,761 --> 00:49:41,720
treatment for the individuals
early as possible,

859
00:49:41,990 --> 00:49:45,710
the first episode of psychosis,
which normally happens, uh, in the,

860
00:49:45,711 --> 00:49:49,370
in the late teens, early twenties,
slight different from men and women.

861
00:49:49,670 --> 00:49:53,720
It's a devastate can be a devastating
life course if you, if it fully develops,

862
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:56,810
if you can get it really early
and get early treatment in,

863
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:59,600
you can prevent the
condition from developing.

864
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:03,500
You can help person psychologically,
medically if a team gets in then early.

865
00:50:03,501 --> 00:50:03,890
So if,

866
00:50:03,890 --> 00:50:07,730
if that's a really good news story is
that we don't have longterm patients.

867
00:50:07,731 --> 00:50:11,790
If you can get them quick, you can divert
the psychosis, you can prevent it. Um,

868
00:50:11,870 --> 00:50:15,290
and it's, it's really late, late
teens ish often connected with, well,

869
00:50:15,291 --> 00:50:17,330
Sonos connect with cannabis use,
not always,

870
00:50:17,810 --> 00:50:22,810
and there are no sources of evidence
that the show clear evidence that one of

871
00:50:22,821 --> 00:50:26,630
the components is family tree where you
work with the family to understand how

872
00:50:26,631 --> 00:50:30,140
to deal the young person is they
often still living at home. Uh,

873
00:50:30,710 --> 00:50:33,590
and that is what the Nice,
what the evidence shows we should do.

874
00:50:33,770 --> 00:50:37,670
But there aren't enough people, so a lot
of people don't get the right treatment.

875
00:50:37,850 --> 00:50:41,600
So sadly there are people out there
not getting what we're not nice as they

876
00:50:41,601 --> 00:50:43,790
should get because the
just aren't enough people.

877
00:50:47,710 --> 00:50:52,460
How's the cost of yeah, sure. Yes,

878
00:50:53,060 --> 00:50:57,080
absolutely. Absolutely, absolutely.
All those things are true,

879
00:50:57,560 --> 00:51:00,750
but it's expensive. Nice question. How
we want to spend our money. I mean,

880
00:51:00,770 --> 00:51:02,900
one of the problems I have to say this,

881
00:51:03,050 --> 00:51:06,810
the last few successive governments
have tried and you'll hear on the news

882
00:51:06,820 --> 00:51:10,820
saying, this notion of this
concept is called parity of esteem.

883
00:51:10,970 --> 00:51:14,540
That we esteem our mental health
as much as our physical health.

884
00:51:15,020 --> 00:51:17,650
But it is not the case.
If you have, if you,

885
00:51:17,820 --> 00:51:22,790
if you Sally diagnosed with some kidney
disease or cancer or something, um,

886
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:26,660
you will get seen pretty quickly and be
seen by the best experts in your area.

887
00:51:26,661 --> 00:51:29,780
Hopefully if you have a mental
health problem like psychosis,

888
00:51:29,781 --> 00:51:33,020
you don't know where they're going to
get treatment because we don't invest as

889
00:51:33,021 --> 00:51:35,450
much in mental, physical health. Um,

890
00:51:35,690 --> 00:51:39,380
that's always been the way because
we stigmatize mental health.

891
00:51:39,380 --> 00:51:41,510
We think there's something wrong with you.

892
00:51:41,660 --> 00:51:44,600
You're to blame somehow
you brought on yourself.

893
00:51:44,601 --> 00:51:46,680
If you have mental
health problem and it's,

894
00:51:46,700 --> 00:51:50,870
it goes quite deep rooted that we use
the word, I use it in casual speech. Oh,

895
00:51:50,871 --> 00:51:54,500
it's psychological. I'll say if I've got
a stomachache, oh, it's psychological.

896
00:51:54,980 --> 00:51:55,401
In other words,

897
00:51:55,401 --> 00:51:59,690
it's not real because it doesn't mean
how to tool because what is psychological

898
00:51:59,691 --> 00:52:03,770
is absolutely real. And we are, we
are, we are physical, mental being,

899
00:52:03,780 --> 00:52:05,000
we're all together. We all, you know,

900
00:52:05,001 --> 00:52:08,150
you can't have a mental health prom
without a physical health problem and vice

901
00:52:08,151 --> 00:52:12,050
versa. But over history we've tended
to put one in box more than the other.

902
00:52:12,051 --> 00:52:13,730
One's good and one's bad.

903
00:52:14,030 --> 00:52:17,930
So mental health hasn't had the
investments in this series. Treatments.

904
00:52:18,140 --> 00:52:20,360
I think that's changing.
I say that is changing.

905
00:52:20,361 --> 00:52:23,030
There is more important
now placed on that.

906
00:52:23,090 --> 00:52:25,940
And certainly going back to the question
of the UK, us, I if he's still here,

907
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:29,750
gentleness. Oh yes. W is
that we've been much more

908
00:52:31,610 --> 00:52:35,390
nervous to talk about
mental health in the UK.

909
00:52:36,830 --> 00:52:41,300
I think it's changing now, especially
with, with CBT coming more,

910
00:52:41,420 --> 00:52:46,420
having people more access to it to say
you're having therapies now reasonable.

911
00:52:46,431 --> 00:52:50,390
And people talk about that. It
used to be anathema. For example,

912
00:52:50,391 --> 00:52:52,190
in our training when we train people,

913
00:52:52,191 --> 00:52:55,240
I remember my father saying to me
when I was thinking about trainer,

914
00:52:55,390 --> 00:52:58,620
oh that's very interesting. But, um,
you know, it's, it's not, not, uh,

915
00:52:59,300 --> 00:53:03,410
if you want to go into this not working
with very nice people and you'll be so

916
00:53:03,411 --> 00:53:05,750
important that you yourself don't
have any mental health problems.

917
00:53:05,990 --> 00:53:10,990
Now we see it very definitely from that
we see we as trainers and as students

918
00:53:11,660 --> 00:53:14,600
and as practitioners may well have
mental health firms ourselves.

919
00:53:14,630 --> 00:53:18,140
Everybody has mental health problems.
We're not different. We're trying to,

920
00:53:18,141 --> 00:53:21,020
in some ways I might break
my leg or have diabetes.

921
00:53:21,190 --> 00:53:23,410
It doesn't make me a bad doctor.
Likewise,

922
00:53:23,411 --> 00:53:25,560
I might be suffering from
mental health problems. Well,

923
00:53:25,561 --> 00:53:27,150
it's okay to do that is not,

924
00:53:27,151 --> 00:53:31,740
I'm a bad person so we're trying very
much to change the attitudes which are

925
00:53:31,741 --> 00:53:35,070
difficult, but you absolutely right
about that. We should spend more.

926
00:53:35,071 --> 00:53:38,040
But that's a political discussion
which we can have elsewhere.

927
00:53:40,670 --> 00:53:45,570
Thank you. Um, you mentioned that
CBT and online therapies quite new.

928
00:53:45,660 --> 00:53:45,990
Um,

929
00:53:45,990 --> 00:53:50,730
is there any evidence of the moment
whether it's more effective than that face

930
00:53:50,731 --> 00:53:54,660
to face therapy wasn't engineered?
It is. It seems to be with certain,

931
00:53:54,661 --> 00:53:56,280
with certain groups is as effective,

932
00:53:56,281 --> 00:53:59,500
which is quite challenging to all of
us who've been doing it for years. Um,

933
00:53:59,940 --> 00:54:01,890
but what was interesting is, um, yes,

934
00:54:01,891 --> 00:54:03,930
it so does that was effective
and that's a good thing to do,

935
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:07,500
but it has to be set out right and you
have to get the relationship factors in

936
00:54:07,501 --> 00:54:10,560
there. Right. I mentioned I did the
sleep here program, which was, uh,

937
00:54:10,590 --> 00:54:14,340
which was interesting to do.
But what I found myself doing was I would,

938
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:17,910
I assume that I was talking to this guy,
you know, I would, I would think, well,

939
00:54:17,911 --> 00:54:19,910
what's he, what's he thinking
about me? Now? Of course it wasn't,

940
00:54:19,950 --> 00:54:21,540
he wasn't thinking it's a program,

941
00:54:21,660 --> 00:54:24,120
but what people do is they
liked it to be a person there.

942
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:28,050
So I think when we design these things,
well, they can be helpful. One of the,

943
00:54:28,080 --> 00:54:30,240
one of the,
one of the very,

944
00:54:30,241 --> 00:54:32,760
very important things to do is
change how people think about it.

945
00:54:32,761 --> 00:54:36,900
And one of the good things about rolling
out programs is it helps people to

946
00:54:36,901 --> 00:54:39,480
think, to normalize it more. Just quickly.

947
00:54:39,481 --> 00:54:43,200
One point I should make
about the cognitive model I
talked about where you can

948
00:54:43,201 --> 00:54:44,430
think one of the,

949
00:54:44,431 --> 00:54:49,200
one of the most damaging things people
can think about is how abnormal their

950
00:54:49,201 --> 00:54:53,490
thinking is. And if you can normalize
it helped people to know what,

951
00:54:53,510 --> 00:54:57,920
what when one of the things we know
about post traumatic stress disorder, um,

952
00:54:58,080 --> 00:55:01,620
when you've had a traumatic episode,
when something happens,

953
00:55:01,710 --> 00:55:06,150
if a bomb dropped on us, we, it's
gasoline traumatic. We will all have,

954
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:10,500
but see when we've, hopefully we
survive it. We will have flashbacks,

955
00:55:10,501 --> 00:55:14,820
we will have bad experiences.
If you can understand that that's normal.

956
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:19,880
Normal people always have bad experiences
after trauma and granted they fade

957
00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:24,300
over the days, the months, your
traumatic experiences that will fade,

958
00:55:24,510 --> 00:55:26,100
then you will get better.

959
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:30,900
If you think you are odd and unusual
and it's of evidence shows that you are

960
00:55:30,901 --> 00:55:32,510
uniquely week,
uh,

961
00:55:32,540 --> 00:55:35,910
mentally ill because you've had
this trauma is traumatic reaction,

962
00:55:36,060 --> 00:55:37,860
then you won't get better so quickly.

963
00:55:38,340 --> 00:55:42,270
One of the great things about rolling
up large scale is perhaps people will

964
00:55:42,330 --> 00:55:46,740
understand that their reactions are
actually normal. So k to feel trauma.

965
00:55:46,741 --> 00:55:49,620
It's okay to feel bad
and that's rolling out.

966
00:55:49,860 --> 00:55:53,970
Larger scale programs will help people
to see the mental health problems are not

967
00:55:53,971 --> 00:55:56,460
unique. You're not the only one
to feel depressed, sad, angry,

968
00:55:56,760 --> 00:56:00,210
have relationship problems. It's
normal, it's human. And that's, I think,

969
00:56:00,211 --> 00:56:01,920
what large scale programs,

970
00:56:01,921 --> 00:56:06,150
which hopefully organizations such as
yourselves will be helpful to us in

971
00:56:06,151 --> 00:56:06,984
developing.

972
00:56:07,870 --> 00:56:08,670
Thanks very much.
