1
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:07,080
Welcome to all of you.

2
00:00:07,081 --> 00:00:12,030
Welcome to the math circle which is
extremely peculiar because we never teach

3
00:00:12,031 --> 00:00:15,900
anyone anything.
It's a school without lectures,

4
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:20,340
without textbooks,
without grades,

5
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:24,810
without tests,
without homework.

6
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:30,620
What does it have left math and the
beauty of it and collegial conversation.

7
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:38,730
Never competitive people.
A very small group of people.

8
00:00:38,731 --> 00:00:42,960
Always 10 is about our
maximum with a leader.

9
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:49,280
All the leader does is put accessible
mystery in front of them and accessible

10
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:54,340
mystery something which really leads
behind the appearances to the underlying

11
00:00:54,481 --> 00:00:56,490
structure.
Our book,

12
00:00:57,150 --> 00:01:00,330
the art of the infinite has
10 of those mysteries in it.

13
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:06,060
Hidden structure which it
takes a lot of imagination,

14
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:11,100
goodwill conversation with
one another to uncover,

15
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:16,160
to come to grips with and still have
doubts at the end but informed doubts.

16
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:19,950
Our motto,
well,

17
00:01:19,951 --> 00:01:23,730
one of them is learning to
speak our loss native language,

18
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:29,090
but another is tell me that I forget asked
me and I discover and not only do the

19
00:01:33,511 --> 00:01:38,511
students in the master goal to teach
one another and the what that hidden

20
00:01:38,761 --> 00:01:40,920
structure is in their discoveries,

21
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:46,940
but they come to admire
one another and have self,

22
00:01:49,501 --> 00:01:54,501
their own self esteem increased
because they're not being told things,

23
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:57,840
they're discovering them.
But look, what am I doing?

24
00:01:57,841 --> 00:01:59,700
I'm telling you things
because this is wrong.

25
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:02,250
You should be discovering for
yourself with a math circle is.

26
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:06,690
So let's give you a demonstration.
Let's guys,

27
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:10,710
here's the question.
I'm going to draw a,

28
00:02:11,010 --> 00:02:13,920
a grid of five by five grid.

29
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,120
By grid I mean kind of a chess board.
Um,

30
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:29,810
five lines.
We'll have five spaces for squares.

31
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:35,580
You don't want me for,
this is weird.

32
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:41,240
I need six lines to get
five horizontal spaces.

33
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:44,040
So I guess I'm going to need six.

34
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:47,593
Yes.

35
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:53,770
Vertical lines to get,
how many squares do I have?

36
00:02:56,210 --> 00:03:00,460
Are you sure? Yes. Okay. No,
I'll take your word for it.

37
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:07,090
One, two, three, four,
five. That might be.

38
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:12,140
I was counting I, I didn't
hear him. He say one.

39
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:17,003
You're sure

40
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:22,350
you have a very orderly mind.
Okay.

41
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:26,700
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine,

42
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:31,850
10 1112 1314 51617181920

43
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:37,740
oh, I forgot. Sorry. I'll
take your word for it.

44
00:03:37,741 --> 00:03:42,660
They're 25
wonderful idea.

45
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:46,500
Okay.
I'm gonna learn a lot from you guys.

46
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:53,230
If you were to start in
the upper left and square,

47
00:03:53,231 --> 00:03:55,450
do I have that right? Okay. Thank you.

48
00:03:56,440 --> 00:04:01,420
If you were to start there and draw a
line that's going to go through all the

49
00:04:01,421 --> 00:04:04,750
squares each square once and only once,

50
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:10,020
and never take your chore off the Board
or your pen off the paper even when to

51
00:04:10,511 --> 00:04:12,220
go up and down and left and right.
Okay.

52
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:16,930
Is it possible to do that starting
from here or probably not possible?

53
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:22,150
Yes. I think. What do, what do you
think? You think it's possible?

54
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:27,000
I don't think so. Yep. Come on, Joey.

55
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:34,570
Oh,
fantastic.

56
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:39,670
Okay. I'm convinced. Thank you.
That's, that's great idea. Thank you.

57
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:44,890
Do you agree that's the only way
you can do that? That's terrific.

58
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:49,420
Samuel, you, it could come and Shelby.

59
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:54,060
Okay. All Yours Samuel. Oh,

60
00:04:56,490 --> 00:04:58,750
oh, that's neat. And I forget
if we can get to the, Oh,

61
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:02,050
you've got to the middle of one.
Terrific. Terrific. Thank you very much.

62
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:06,490
So there are two ways of
doing it. Yes. Petra, come on.

63
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:10,480
Really?
You're saying there's a third way?

64
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:16,210
Yes.
Oh,

65
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:21,130
you're doing it kind
of in the rotated way.

66
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:25,870
It's [inaudible] kind of
rotated 90 degrees. Beautiful.

67
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:30,550
There are three there. Wait
a minute. Daniel. Daniel,

68
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:34,090
how many ways are there going to be

69
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:41,260
over a hundred over a hundred.
Nathan, did you calculate this or

70
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:47,740
no? I'm sorry. I should've
said can't go diagonally.

71
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:53,140
Only up and down and left and right.
It was a brilliant idea.

72
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:57,710
I liked diagonal lines as a
lot of, you know, but not here.

73
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:03,170
And we've asked this one and then covered
that and then cover that and then do

74
00:06:03,171 --> 00:06:07,590
it like that.
Show me Daniel without the dad.

75
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:11,210
She'd go diagonally down.

76
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:16,220
You stops here and then you and then you
go up and then when my dad and then you

77
00:06:17,831 --> 00:06:21,860
can do that with the out using a
diagonal with an up and down motion

78
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:29,690
down all the way

79
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,313
up,

80
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:39,300
all the way

81
00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:02,660
you want. You want to connect that
back up there. Oh, that's nice.

82
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:06,290
You've got to kind of a
revelation of a castle.

83
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:14,000
One, two, three, four, five. I
think. One, two, three, four,

84
00:07:14,001 --> 00:07:18,290
five, one, two, three,
four, five. You were right.

85
00:07:18,291 --> 00:07:21,050
This is an extra box of mine.

86
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:25,120
Okay. Then go ahead. Go ahead.

87
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:32,993
Go ahead.

88
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,200
Go ahead.

89
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:03,010
Wait, wait. You had a good question.

90
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:07,610
They have to have to conduct
definitely one continuous line.

91
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,960
I think this is really nice.
Daniel does his work

92
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:21,400
as a hundred you say forever,

93
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:27,350
which is more or less forever a deal.

94
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:33,080
Fantastic. Hold onto it. Okay,
Daniel, this is great. Thanks a lot.

95
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:37,730
I remember where you were ever
getting news. How about usher?

96
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,770
Petra.
Petra?

97
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:52,810
I'm not sure it's the question.
It's,

98
00:08:52,811 --> 00:08:55,920
it's one of the questions that that I
thought of and you've got to come up with

99
00:08:55,921 --> 00:08:56,640
fantastic

100
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:00,960
answers. One, two no, three no four,
no, 100, no one infinite number.

101
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:03,180
Oh, sure. And then

102
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:07,350
while I'm doing this thing for yourself,

103
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:11,310
decide the question of
how many ways are there,

104
00:09:11,311 --> 00:09:15,570
we know there were at least three or
four and there might be a hundred.

105
00:09:15,571 --> 00:09:20,190
There might be an infant room. Yeah,
there's not an infinite number.

106
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:24,210
Why not? Because like eventually
you're going to actually,

107
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:30,390
you have to have an infinite number of
boxes to have an infinite number of what

108
00:09:30,391 --> 00:09:32,040
a great idea.
Okay.

109
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:34,863
Okay.

110
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:41,760
One, two, three, four, five, one, two,

111
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:46,080
three, four, five. Okay.

112
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:55,990
Oh,
this is like Danielle's.

113
00:09:56,050 --> 00:09:59,400
Oh Yup.
Patrol is telling him something.

114
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,500
I don't think the chocolates make lesions.

115
00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:09,230
Oh,
that's great.

116
00:10:12,530 --> 00:10:16,820
Oh, sure did. Was to
combine previous ideas.

117
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:19,190
That's doing math.
That's taking previous,

118
00:10:19,191 --> 00:10:22,190
I promise I'll come to you
later immediately. Uh, taking,

119
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:23,840
building on these ideas together.

120
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:27,350
You're working collegially
it's just super with uh,

121
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,960
kind of top of a castle.

122
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:35,020
You see those Tufts up a castle and then
some of the straight line right down

123
00:10:35,361 --> 00:10:36,194
the middle.

124
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:41,090
Could it have been elsewhere
and then zip over and do the

125
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:46,790
zigzag backward. It's really nice.
By the way, your your letter,

126
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:50,000
he is hiding in here. Okay. Um, Leah,

127
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:54,800
different from all
these, okay. Come on up.

128
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:59,840
Maybe there really are an infinite number.
Think about another question.

129
00:10:59,841 --> 00:11:04,150
Besides how many ways,
sorry.

130
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:08,990
When do you accidentally going to copy
one of the ones that you are such a good

131
00:11:08,991 --> 00:11:09,824
question.

132
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:14,690
Is anyone keeping track of whether we're
going to be doing something again that

133
00:11:14,691 --> 00:11:17,810
we did before or you rememory so good.
Mine isn't that.

134
00:11:17,811 --> 00:11:22,320
You'll remember all the previous
ones. Very good point. Um,

135
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:25,520
or are you worried that
yours might be an old one?

136
00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:32,090
Okay.
If you're pretty sure not,

137
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:35,240
that means it must be a different,

138
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:37,580
a different basic idea.

139
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:42,920
I'm actually kind of
surprised nobody did it. Okay.

140
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:48,890
It shows that although we all have
mines and they're all terrific,

141
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:52,490
our minds work differently.

142
00:11:58,410 --> 00:12:00,520
Oh,
oh,

143
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:09,090
stop for a second. Does anybody
worried? Yeah. You're worried.

144
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:14,490
Yeah. You're worried. Okay.
Step aside for a second.

145
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:21,510
Don't, don't say why you're worried, but
you're both worried. Anybody else worried?

146
00:12:21,511 --> 00:12:23,970
You're worried?
Go ahead.

147
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:26,850
Oh,

148
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:28,583
I actually,

149
00:12:32,770 --> 00:12:34,090
oh,

150
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,740
you're really seeing things.

151
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:43,060
You're seeing things that don't work.

152
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:48,160
Which kind of tells you what does work.
Go ahead.

153
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:53,230
Oh, excellent. You avoided the
problem of having two directions.

154
00:12:53,231 --> 00:12:56,770
You had to go in and you could
want to go in one. Beautiful.

155
00:12:57,340 --> 00:13:01,240
I do think that's new, isn't
it? Yeah. Okay. That is super.

156
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:05,980
You guys are amazing. You idea
having other ones. Okay. Come on up.

157
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:08,530
Can I leave this and give
you a pink shawl? Okay.

158
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:20,500
Oh,
that's a nice,

159
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:24,190
that's really nice.
Looking at this,

160
00:13:24,191 --> 00:13:27,250
looking at the pink one at pink one,

161
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:32,500
can you automatically see another one that
hasn't been done automatically? Great.

162
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:37,090
Leah? I think I do. Don't
come up and tell me.

163
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:41,590
Looking at the pink mine, do
you automatically, let me,

164
00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:45,190
let me recite the pink line.
Start here.

165
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:49,480
Go right all the way. Go down all
the way. Go across all the way.

166
00:13:49,481 --> 00:13:54,481
Go up part of the way up to the fourth
square and then start wiggling down and

167
00:13:55,301 --> 00:13:58,540
stop there.
Yes,

168
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:02,280
Nathan minds,
but I think you'll have to.

169
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:12,720
Okay.
Yes.

170
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:17,000
So you took part of what
you did and changed it.

171
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:21,840
Nice idea. Wait, actually, no,
we shouldn't be there. I know.

172
00:14:21,841 --> 00:14:24,270
Losing track of whether
repeating anything's we had.

173
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:27,450
One of the things we had
before. That's, that's terrific.

174
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:33,000
You guys have an enormous
amount of imagination because
math is done with one's

175
00:14:33,001 --> 00:14:37,860
imagination. Let me ask you a
question before you pick up your,

176
00:14:37,861 --> 00:14:41,040
you're basically running this class,
not me, but I have, I've got a question.

177
00:14:42,450 --> 00:14:45,060
I'm going to take one of the paths.

178
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:48,570
I know it was done. If
fact, the very first one,

179
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,370
I want you to tell me something.

180
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:54,590
Here's that first path.

181
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:07,090
I forget where the

182
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:14,150
like that. Am I right? Yeah. Okay.

183
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:17,060
Without doing anything,

184
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:19,700
without asking me to do anything more.

185
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:24,620
Tell me a second path
that's there. Yes. Yes.

186
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:26,910
It's the same phone

187
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:32,490
start to finish.

188
00:15:33,210 --> 00:15:35,880
Is it a star finish?

189
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,910
Every time you draw one path
you get one more for free.

190
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:45,080
That means whether the
number is 200 or infinite.

191
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:52,820
It's going to have to be even because
for every path you draw there's the path

192
00:15:53,041 --> 00:15:54,600
with the end of the beginning of reversed.

193
00:15:57,090 --> 00:15:58,920
So weird.

194
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:05,970
Well that's, there are at least
two paths. There are at least four.

195
00:16:05,971 --> 00:16:07,350
I mean there are at least six.
I mean,

196
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:11,790
what do I mean there are at least
a hundred there might be 99 yes,

197
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:16,850
we had five and then it gets
the point you made Talton yeah.

198
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:23,370
Yup.
Good.

199
00:16:23,770 --> 00:16:24,760
Myself,

200
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:29,010
I got a different sort of a question.

201
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:34,790
This is work so well and we haven't
even began to finally settle on how many

202
00:16:35,431 --> 00:16:38,730
times you can do it.
Starting here is there,

203
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,160
this is a weird question.

204
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:46,290
Is there any other place you could have
started that would have worked at all or

205
00:16:46,291 --> 00:16:47,910
as well?
Leah.

206
00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:49,603
Okay,

207
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:54,050
star here.
How do you know about is going to work?

208
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:57,710
Well,
you can just go the opposite way.

209
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:03,760
Terrific possible start possible start.
Petra

210
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:04,970
starts in the sector.

211
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:10,130
Hey, that's wonderful. We had a
path that ended in the setter.

212
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:13,910
Therefore there has to be a path
that starts from the center. Asher,

213
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:17,170
so ending up what she said.
All right.

214
00:17:17,290 --> 00:17:19,470
That you could start on
the top right corner.

215
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:22,990
You could actually get old
ones we've currently done.

216
00:17:23,330 --> 00:17:24,880
You could just turn them right,

217
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:30,740
rotate the board instead of
rotating our drawing deal.

218
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:31,583
What were you gonna say?

219
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:37,810
Any part on the boy would
be a possible solution,

220
00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:39,270
but you just have to alter the wrong.

221
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:44,500
Fantastic. You could start
in any square so far.

222
00:17:44,501 --> 00:17:49,501
We know you can start
then this one and this one

223
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:55,520
and this one and this one and
in the center or in this one?

224
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:59,940
This one. In this one and this
one or there. I'm just doing the,

225
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:03,090
taking the endings and going
back to the beginnings.

226
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:04,830
I seem to have gotten the same thing.

227
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:09,480
There are at least five places you can
start from and your suggestion is we

228
00:18:09,481 --> 00:18:12,750
could start absolutely anywhere
and just be careful. Okay.

229
00:18:12,810 --> 00:18:16,360
I want to take what you suggested.
Dhea,

230
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:20,490
you feel pretty much in charge of
this question right now? Yeah, Nathan,

231
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:23,790
so I was wondering, can I
show? Yeah, yeah. Come on up.

232
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:31,223
Okay.

233
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:36,730
What an interesting idea.
Okay.

234
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:43,163
Could you go like

235
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,740
you lifted your truck,
you lifted your truck,

236
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:54,210
you can't lift your truck.
Nevertheless,

237
00:18:54,211 --> 00:18:59,070
you can do what you wanted I think
without lifting your truck here, let me,

238
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:01,560
let me just,
I mean you could,

239
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:06,830
I was just wondering if you could use
to start going and push it off two ways.

240
00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:14,880
Your question is, can you for,
I could do it without lifting.

241
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:18,270
Go ahead.
Oh,

242
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:24,810
watch out for this guy.
Okay.

243
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:26,010
I'll be much more precise.

244
00:19:26,011 --> 00:19:30,210
You're asking me to be more precise in
my language without lifting your chalk

245
00:19:30,211 --> 00:19:32,790
and without going over the
same line the second time.

246
00:19:40,530 --> 00:19:43,350
Only once. Wait a minute.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

247
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:47,910
I've just drawn that line.
7,981 times,

248
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:52,320
haven't I?
They're all next to one another.

249
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:59,750
I think Nathan, you could
still get your pattern. Do it.

250
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:06,500
Oh yeah, right to question.
If you could go two ways.

251
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:12,000
Gotcha. That's a really nice other
question which we should explore.

252
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:16,880
Nathan's brought up completely new
question. Take a five by five grid or,

253
00:20:16,881 --> 00:20:20,070
or of four, two by two
grid aren't. They're

254
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:26,330
twofold. Double paths that'll
work and if so, how many?

255
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:28,500
In other words instead of going like that.

256
00:20:28,530 --> 00:20:33,210
Could you go like that and then
like that where something like that.

257
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:34,920
Interesting question. Yes. Daniel.

258
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:44,700
Or if you have two arms, cause you have
to have two hands for the piece of,

259
00:20:44,970 --> 00:20:47,450
if you're an octopus you can do eight,
right?

260
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:54,050
You can also program a
robot to like three or nine.

261
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:57,140
Very good.
I want to get back to something to do.

262
00:20:57,141 --> 00:21:01,220
You're raised going back to
our original, um, whoops.

263
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:06,260
Our original five by five.
Do you said, tell me if I'm,

264
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:08,750
if I'm quoting you correctly,
do they really,

265
00:21:08,751 --> 00:21:12,470
you can start from any square as
long as you're careful. Right.

266
00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:19,910
But any place that's
like next to the corner,

267
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:21,830
you can't start there.

268
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:29,500
A fascinating idea. Let's see. Let's see,

269
00:21:33,690 --> 00:21:38,550
one, two, three, four, five. I'll, I'll
try to be really careful in drawing this.

270
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:43,230
You were saying starting in
a place next to a corner,

271
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:46,920
where would you like me to start from?
By the way?

272
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:50,160
Somebody suggested at the very beginning
that we do something which would make

273
00:21:50,161 --> 00:21:51,090
talking about this sport.

274
00:21:53,790 --> 00:21:54,630
Remember what it was,

275
00:21:55,810 --> 00:21:58,930
what I was counting the squares where
I was counting all 25 of them and I was

276
00:21:58,931 --> 00:22:02,560
counting this way and that
we'll say it again.

277
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,520
Yes.
What should go in rows.

278
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:14,330
There was something besides my
finger that somebody suggested I do.

279
00:22:15,730 --> 00:22:18,490
You played mark every square.
You've already,

280
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:22,870
she wouldn't double count,
but you could still do that.

281
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:26,120
What do you want to market with?
What do you want to market with?

282
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:32,750
I was thinking how sure of your question
about is this all going to be geometry?

283
00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:36,680
It could be something else.

284
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:42,560
Well, it's not geometry, but
like, I mean I met like, Hey,

285
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:49,700
what do you mean equation math? Go on.
What do we equations involve numbers.

286
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:52,580
What if I mark these scores with numbers?

287
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:58,190
Somebody said at the beginning,
why don't you just number the squares?

288
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:03,010
I like it takes longer,
but you could actually,

289
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:07,900
I was thinking when I said that
more about speed and not really.

290
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:11,200
I know, I know, but I think
you can count by fives.

291
00:23:12,430 --> 00:23:13,690
You can count by fives.

292
00:23:14,150 --> 00:23:16,910
I'm good at it.
Last time.

293
00:23:16,911 --> 00:23:19,160
What I did was I counted in this way,

294
00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:24,310
but I could really be very regular and
count like this if I put these numbers in

295
00:23:26,511 --> 00:23:31,370
just to make it easier to talk about
when Dhea suggested I start in a square

296
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:35,780
next to a square in the corner.
I guess she meant square number two.

297
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:41,720
Oh,
thanks for filling this in.

298
00:23:42,050 --> 00:23:46,400
21222320420

299
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,510
five okay.

300
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:53,570
Couldn't stay there because this way

301
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,193
is this going to work?

302
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:08,110
I can show you how you can do.
That's great to hear.

303
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:08,953
Thank you.

304
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:16,400
Except when you go here you go.
Go like this.

305
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:21,070
Well actually no, not that this

306
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,170
is wrong.
Things to use Roy,

307
00:24:31,171 --> 00:24:36,020
that you can't start from square
number two Asher and then Daniel. Oh,

308
00:24:36,021 --> 00:24:40,430
you all got your hands up at once
then Daniel, then Samuel. Yes.

309
00:24:40,450 --> 00:24:41,283
You could

310
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:46,393
watch

311
00:24:58,050 --> 00:25:02,620
that actually on the board.
It's looking at

312
00:25:08,210 --> 00:25:12,350
what is going on with the
problem that Diaz raised.

313
00:25:13,290 --> 00:25:14,200
Takes it over here.

314
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:20,080
She can't make it easier by cause
he doesn't have to go like that.

315
00:25:20,870 --> 00:25:25,850
He can do it here. Let's see.
So are you saying two, one, six,

316
00:25:25,851 --> 00:25:29,990
seven, eight three, four, five, ten nine.

317
00:25:29,991 --> 00:25:31,100
So far so good.

318
00:25:31,490 --> 00:25:36,490
14 1520 and then you go to
20,025 I don't draw that.

319
00:25:39,141 --> 00:25:40,160
And blue,
go ahead.

320
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:47,813
This is going to work.

321
00:25:51,530 --> 00:25:56,180
She's retracing the previous path,
but when she gets to 20,

322
00:25:56,181 --> 00:26:01,181
she goes down to 25 across to 24
after 20 91823221716 and skipped 13.

323
00:26:12,010 --> 00:26:13,250
Yes. Wait, Atlanta,

324
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:21,740
another way that's going to
work starting with two. Great.

325
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:26,640
And Samuel, you've had your hand
up for a long time starting.

326
00:26:27,430 --> 00:26:28,263
Maybe you could go

327
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:45,200
now what? You've left out 15. Oh, right,

328
00:26:50,990 --> 00:26:55,470
yes.
Can you put the same line and two squares?

329
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:01,740
What do you mean?
Like if there was one square,

330
00:27:01,970 --> 00:27:05,980
could you put two lines in there?
Oh, no, nope. Absolutely not. Um,

331
00:27:06,290 --> 00:27:08,220
what the mind is a straight,

332
00:27:08,221 --> 00:27:11,940
steady line and it never goes back in
the square in a square. It's been in,

333
00:27:14,410 --> 00:27:16,320
uh,
what does it mean?

334
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:21,200
How AQAP during down a deer

335
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:27,660
could just spiral.
Let's try a spiral.

336
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:30,180
Go on. Go ahead. Go ahead.

337
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:34,753
Oh,

338
00:27:43,390 --> 00:27:48,060
yeah. Yeah. We ended 19. Yep.

339
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:50,760
Stuck again.

340
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:55,710
Is this something wrong with our
imaginations or with the problem?

341
00:27:56,160 --> 00:28:00,930
Uh, Leah. Terrific.

342
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:04,510
At Dia you think you have one?
How about Dhea than Leah

343
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:08,550
asked herself what is going on?

344
00:28:08,551 --> 00:28:13,551
It was so successful starting from corner
with lots and lots of an even number

345
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:20,780
of paths and we can't even get one
starting from square two started.

346
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:27,990
Well we can get it started but he
can't go on one, two, three, four,

347
00:28:27,991 --> 00:28:32,190
five, one, two, three,

348
00:28:32,430 --> 00:28:35,280
four,
five and we're starting to,

349
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:39,920
this is going to be responsible.

350
00:28:51,090 --> 00:28:53,160
It was beautiful up to there.

351
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:04,530
What is wrong? Why can't we
do this? You guys are so good.

352
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,033
Yes.

353
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:12,510
It's kind of wedged in between two pieces.

354
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:17,340
Pieces wedged in between two pieces.
Is that what you mean?

355
00:29:17,570 --> 00:29:22,290
Well except one piece hasn't
got you

356
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:29,250
your idea. Come on. This is great.

357
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:32,640
This is really fascinating.

358
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,010
Trouble we're having.

359
00:29:35,490 --> 00:29:38,340
I don't quite understand why we're
having so much trouble with it.

360
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:43,060
I mean you guys now all that
you're really good at this.

361
00:29:43,390 --> 00:29:45,460
You're good at imagining counting.

362
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:51,040
You're actually better I think
at than I am and yet just saying,

363
00:29:52,931 --> 00:29:57,410
can we start in the second
square from the quarter?

364
00:30:00,010 --> 00:30:01,960
Well,
prior to tribe.

365
00:30:04,390 --> 00:30:05,440
So far so good.

366
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:16,750
Oh, thank you. Oh wait a sec. One,

367
00:30:16,751 --> 00:30:19,030
two, three, four, five.
It's that stops here.

368
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:27,610
Yeah. Okay. Okay. Stop for a second.

369
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:32,080
Is it okay so far?
Any trouble?

370
00:30:32,081 --> 00:30:34,720
Do you see any trouble in the
future? You see trouble, Samuel?

371
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:36,640
Where do you see trouble?

372
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:46,900
Ah Ha. Okay, go ahead.

373
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:49,900
So far she's avoiding that.

374
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,350
The look what's happened.
Look what's happened.

375
00:30:57,310 --> 00:31:00,050
You have a choice.
If they've then,

376
00:31:00,370 --> 00:31:03,730
if Nathan's idea that we could go in
two directions at once, we'd be done,

377
00:31:04,210 --> 00:31:05,260
but we don't have that.

378
00:31:05,290 --> 00:31:09,370
We can only go in one direction at
once and you can either go up and you

379
00:31:09,371 --> 00:31:11,980
certainly are welcome to go up,
but then you leave that out.

380
00:31:12,190 --> 00:31:14,080
You can go left and he felt that way.

381
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:20,320
Why is it so difficult?
Why doesn't it work?

382
00:31:20,590 --> 00:31:25,570
What's the trouble with
us? Yes. Fantastic.

383
00:31:25,571 --> 00:31:28,090
Come on up.
Okay.

384
00:31:33,930 --> 00:31:35,860
That,
that the old top of the castle.

385
00:31:41,830 --> 00:31:46,280
Wait, wait, wait. This just
six. Sarah and Sarah. I'll
just, I'll just get rid of, uh,

386
00:31:46,570 --> 00:31:47,740
that much.
Okay.

387
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:58,240
You mean there's already trouble? It's
too late already. Leah, what do you think?

388
00:31:58,330 --> 00:32:03,210
Too late already
then.

389
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:09,150
I think your idea was great.
Yes.

390
00:32:18,390 --> 00:32:20,070
Let's see

391
00:32:23,770 --> 00:32:28,450
what's happened here. Oh,
this is okay. In other words,

392
00:32:28,690 --> 00:32:33,070
you've missed that square. How did I
know that there was going to be a problem

393
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:41,090
that's called induction.
Gone Away.

394
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:43,970
Oh dear.

395
00:32:44,510 --> 00:32:49,510
Why don't you all say the minute
you see a problem coming up?

396
00:32:55,610 --> 00:32:59,390
We start here. Anybody see
a problem coming up? Okay.

397
00:33:04,170 --> 00:33:07,760
Okay. So far. Okay.

398
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:13,520
Okay, so far. Why is it okay so far?

399
00:33:19,730 --> 00:33:22,900
Yeah, to say an idea. Okay.

400
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:25,790
We know what she's the one who
got one choice when she's here,

401
00:33:25,791 --> 00:33:30,740
she has to go this way and you choose to
go all the way across everything. Okay.

402
00:33:30,741 --> 00:33:31,574
So far

403
00:33:34,150 --> 00:33:38,010
it's meant to be five by five by five.
Oh,

404
00:33:40,690 --> 00:33:41,523
okay.

405
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:52,010
Keep that idea in mind. Yes. Sasha.
Wait, wait, wait, let go ahead. Go ahead.

406
00:33:52,011 --> 00:33:53,000
Go ahead with what you've got

407
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:06,110
ups,
you got in the square twice.

408
00:34:22,210 --> 00:34:24,230
Uh, you can't, you went
and squares twice again.

409
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:28,190
You want to because you want to get to
that square and that's the only way you

410
00:34:28,191 --> 00:34:29,990
can do it and you're stuck.

411
00:34:30,970 --> 00:34:33,950
You're just one square off finishing it.

412
00:34:42,530 --> 00:34:45,170
It's interesting. And one,
two, three, four, five, one,

413
00:34:45,171 --> 00:34:48,710
two years is five by five
and you've done that.

414
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:50,893
You

415
00:34:55,640 --> 00:35:00,230
should. We number her
steps. This is one, two,

416
00:35:00,530 --> 00:35:04,010
three, four, five,

417
00:35:04,790 --> 00:35:09,070
six. I'm sorry. We don't we,

418
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:11,960
well that's because I started
with a number two in the corner.

419
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:16,600
There still is five squares. I'm numbering
now the steps instead of the roads. Uh,

420
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:19,310
seven, eight, nine,

421
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:25,540
01112131415 1516

422
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:36,820
1718 61718192021

423
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:48,390
to 23.

424
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:53,700
I'm not sure we're ever going to
get to that. Where would a second

425
00:35:55,690 --> 00:36:00,430
one, two, three, four, five,
one, two, three, four. Oh, sorry.

426
00:36:00,490 --> 00:36:05,440
My board seems to have one, two, three,
four, five. Yeah, six. It's six wide.

427
00:36:06,490 --> 00:36:10,120
That's interesting. When it was
66 wide, it's broken by one.

428
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:16,150
Oh, right. You are
right. You are one, two,

429
00:36:16,151 --> 00:36:18,820
three, four, five. That
line going through is that,

430
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:22,740
it's to the point that one square,
how's this worked?

431
00:36:24,030 --> 00:36:27,550
I might take,
take a look at d as paper.

432
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:36,070
So far so good by the way.
One, two, three, four,

433
00:36:36,071 --> 00:36:39,400
five by one, two, three, four.

434
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:45,890
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.

435
00:36:46,810 --> 00:36:51,580
Wait a sec. Oh, oh, I see. Those are
two. One, two, three, four, five.

436
00:36:51,581 --> 00:36:54,340
One, two, three, four,
five. Okay, so you go

437
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:59,350
down the left hand side
and across the bottom.

438
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:04,360
Up the right. Oh, you've
gone into this square twice

439
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:10,780
with this line and with that line.
Oh, it was so beautiful off to there.

440
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:15,790
Oh, 10 minutes left. How can this be?

441
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:21,480
Can we do this for another two hours
please? There we asked you what?

442
00:37:21,890 --> 00:37:24,370
Yes. Daniel says yes. 10
more door hours. Okay.

443
00:37:29,950 --> 00:37:33,530
Is it going to work when you start from
the second square? Hi Nathan. What?

444
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:38,700
I can I show you some? Oh wait,
I might do it on the board. Yep,

445
00:37:38,750 --> 00:37:42,710
please join.
Racist words I think are awesome.

446
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:45,680
It's basic.
It's kind of the same as this,

447
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:49,230
but I think our phones
out we been going across.

448
00:37:54,870 --> 00:37:58,610
It does.
Well,

449
00:37:59,050 --> 00:37:59,883
I didn't,

450
00:37:59,890 --> 00:38:04,870
I didn't realize so I was just estimating
that that might be the problem because

451
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:06,710
I like to estimate some things,

452
00:38:06,750 --> 00:38:10,930
but why luxury estimate of a
hundred is a while ago, by the way,

453
00:38:11,210 --> 00:38:14,230
after you asked a long time ago,

454
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:16,330
is this going to be geometry?

455
00:38:16,390 --> 00:38:20,950
This might be arithmetic
instead of geometry.

456
00:38:20,951 --> 00:38:25,840
I don't know. Asher and then Petra, I
don't think this really counts though.

457
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:26,913
So like,

458
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:31,990
oh,
ah,

459
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:36,793
yeah.

460
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:41,160
So far that is backward.
If something that I think dia did

461
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:46,780
now zigzagging,

462
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,790
stop. You'll, you'll
never get into the list.

463
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:55,940
Oh yeah, yeah, exactly.

464
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:04,023
Great.

465
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:09,670
I've got it for us. Funny question
to ask him for Petra and Leah,

466
00:39:11,410 --> 00:39:16,270
how big is this board? I squares by
five squares. Namely how many squares?

467
00:39:17,670 --> 00:39:21,100
Right squared? Five squared. True.

468
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:26,580
What is five squared is 25 it's 25

469
00:39:28,390 --> 00:39:33,190
what kind of a number is 25 it's a
square number on the smaller number.

470
00:39:33,191 --> 00:39:37,210
It's an odd number.
Squared. It's an odd number.

471
00:39:38,770 --> 00:39:43,070
Can I go back to Nathan's to buy
to board to board to was what?

472
00:39:45,390 --> 00:39:49,000
What's two times two? This is very
difficult. I know, but more or less for,

473
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:54,240
I mean you estimate so it's kind of four
and Alec to by two board a board with

474
00:39:56,140 --> 00:39:59,740
four squares. Can we start
from here? Will it work?

475
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:05,560
Can we start it from here?
Here, here? Yes. Uh Huh.

476
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:11,980
The two by two works is that there's no
square in the middle of the two corner

477
00:40:12,361 --> 00:40:13,840
pieces or a credit piece.

478
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:15,733
Wow.

479
00:40:16,030 --> 00:40:21,030
What a three by three so a three
by three would or wouldn't work.

480
00:40:22,610 --> 00:40:25,040
Three lines.
Three there is that Middle Square.

481
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:28,733
Oh,

482
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:38,230
three by three is trouble.
Five by five is trouble.

483
00:40:39,310 --> 00:40:43,900
What's 729 by 729 trouble
or easy? Actually, I got it.

484
00:40:45,730 --> 00:40:48,220
I did it from, Oh actually, no I didn't.

485
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:55,990
I did it because I sent
him the frame here. Oh,

486
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:59,610
you started from the first
square? No. Yes. Oh, he's
worth from the second squared.

487
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:04,670
This, this piece of Jack got, oh
wait, actually no. Yep. Right.

488
00:41:05,690 --> 00:41:09,650
Starting from the second square.
Hold on.

489
00:41:09,740 --> 00:41:14,120
Odd Number Board does
it not work is trouble.

490
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:16,880
Why Petra?

491
00:41:17,270 --> 00:41:21,300
There probably is a way to do it twice.
It's hard to find.

492
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:24,420
That's great. It, there's
probably a way to do it,

493
00:41:24,421 --> 00:41:25,950
but it's hard to find that
after you were saying,

494
00:41:25,951 --> 00:41:30,360
there's just no way to fight it no
matter how you try five whole minutes.

495
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:34,150
Oh, say it Osher. So I'm just gonna draw

496
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:37,460
a three by three. Okay, good.
So if you start from here,

497
00:41:38,870 --> 00:41:43,320
you can't really do anything
about it because there's, uh,

498
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:47,600
there's always going to be this extra
corner and if you try to eliminate that

499
00:41:47,601 --> 00:41:51,290
corner, I don't know, middle
pieces is not going to work. See,

500
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:56,570
so here you won't work
because you have to,

501
00:41:56,750 --> 00:42:01,750
once you get to like when you to the
point where it's either a corner or the

502
00:42:03,021 --> 00:42:06,920
center, you're always going
to get there. You have to,

503
00:42:06,921 --> 00:42:08,150
you have to only go to one.

504
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:14,100
It's going to leave the center
out or one of the corners.

505
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:15,410
Okay.

506
00:42:15,410 --> 00:42:17,540
Is a 6.6 board go to work or not?

507
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:20,840
It will because it's a seven by seven.

508
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:24,320
No dear.
That's terrific.

509
00:42:25,450 --> 00:42:28,640
Any even number by even number,

510
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:34,120
then it's going to work because like
the reason sales where there's no

511
00:42:37,620 --> 00:42:39,340
middle,
Middle Square,

512
00:42:40,790 --> 00:42:43,690
it won't cross that one odd square.
Yeah,

513
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:46,430
that one. What? Square square?

514
00:42:46,970 --> 00:42:51,770
That one odd square on a 25 square board.

515
00:42:51,771 --> 00:42:52,850
Five by five.

516
00:42:53,210 --> 00:42:56,600
How many odd number squares are there
and how many even number of squares?

517
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:03,850
Yes, I'd prefer square since
it starts with an odd number,

518
00:43:03,860 --> 00:43:05,050
there's going to be one more.

519
00:43:06,580 --> 00:43:11,580
There's always one more odd number square
then even on an odd number of board

520
00:43:13,630 --> 00:43:14,950
and on an even number board.

521
00:43:15,370 --> 00:43:20,210
Okay. Yes, Leah? Five by five. It's not,

522
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:21,670
it's kind of weird but,

523
00:43:25,940 --> 00:43:26,790
but I think,

524
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:31,290
I think you're onto the hidden
deep structure of this problem.

525
00:43:32,100 --> 00:43:37,100
There's always an extra odd number
square on an odd number board and if you

526
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:43,320
going to cover every square, you
better start for them. Odd One.

527
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:47,430
We are not going to cover them all because
there's an extra odd one somewhere in

528
00:43:47,431 --> 00:43:50,760
the center or in a corner
or something like that.

529
00:43:51,590 --> 00:43:53,950
The number on an odd number of squares.

530
00:43:55,620 --> 00:43:57,900
Fantastic guys. Leo,
what do you want to say?

531
00:43:58,830 --> 00:44:01,690
At the end of this, are we able
to ask him a bunch of questions?

532
00:44:01,830 --> 00:44:06,180
Please do. I'm not going to have
any answers, but go ahead and ask.

533
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:08,790
Okay.

534
00:44:08,790 --> 00:44:11,370
Oh, those are the books
that Ellen and I wrote.

535
00:44:11,580 --> 00:44:15,390
The first one out of the
labyrinth is about this approach,

536
00:44:15,391 --> 00:44:19,710
the mass circle approach,
where we do math in the real way.

537
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:23,580
If you guys doing the thinking
so you own it, it's yours.

538
00:44:24,630 --> 00:44:28,740
This is the way we invented with
no textbooks, no tests, no quizzes,

539
00:44:29,310 --> 00:44:30,420
no being told,

540
00:44:30,750 --> 00:44:35,750
but asked and people working together
the way you all did fantastically to come

541
00:44:36,001 --> 00:44:40,920
to the deep, hidden, underlying
structure of the world. The other book,

542
00:44:41,070 --> 00:44:41,970
the art of the infant,

543
00:44:42,150 --> 00:44:45,780
which is mathematics because mathematics
is almost always about the infinite,

544
00:44:46,170 --> 00:44:48,210
the infinite number of possibilities.

545
00:44:49,550 --> 00:44:54,550
It has 10 different problems in it
like this one which is lead you from

546
00:44:56,790 --> 00:45:01,790
confusion and chaos on the
surface to deep structure.

547
00:45:01,891 --> 00:45:05,160
That makes sense.
That gives meaning to a whole thing.

548
00:45:09,430 --> 00:45:12,970
These are the people to afford.
We have 20 minutes.

549
00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:15,990
Fuck. Question. Answer.
Okay. How about parents?

550
00:45:16,210 --> 00:45:18,130
Parents Bedroom.

551
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:21,300
If you end on square,

552
00:45:21,710 --> 00:45:24,920
you can do it backwards and
it will be the same lines.

553
00:45:25,110 --> 00:45:29,430
Absolutely. Absolutely. That's right.

554
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:34,640
Start on one end on 25 in one of our
patterns store on 25 and on one in the

555
00:45:35,220 --> 00:45:37,620
paired pattern.
Asher.

556
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:39,600
Hi. Actually, I

557
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:45,480
like what the art basically
by my name. Matt. Hi.

558
00:45:46,250 --> 00:45:49,910
Actually,
I'm pretty sure infinity is not a number.

559
00:45:50,490 --> 00:45:54,240
You're right. It's like big and
small. Infinity is not a number,

560
00:45:54,241 --> 00:45:59,010
but it is an idea we have. About
how many, oh actually I'm sorry,

561
00:45:59,011 --> 00:46:00,420
how many counting numbers are there?

562
00:46:01,460 --> 00:46:02,293
MMM,

563
00:46:02,540 --> 00:46:06,860
well I thought there were 10,981
counting numbers.

564
00:46:07,070 --> 00:46:10,100
I thought they ended up,
I thought the last one was 10,981

565
00:46:11,250 --> 00:46:12,083
908

566
00:46:14,460 --> 00:46:16,700
so anytime I name accounting
number you can say,

567
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:21,720
well there's one more and that must
suggest there are not a finite,

568
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:26,370
not an ended number of them.
So the infinite is hiding behind this.

569
00:46:26,970 --> 00:46:31,970
How many boards those this problem work
on for any possible starting place and

570
00:46:34,351 --> 00:46:37,740
infinite number,
all the even number boards.

571
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:40,380
And there are an infinite
number of even numbers.

572
00:46:42,030 --> 00:46:44,760
Any questions along the Sterns? Yes. Yeah.

573
00:46:45,580 --> 00:46:47,730
How are we going to do
something like this again? Oh,

574
00:46:47,910 --> 00:46:49,500
you mean in the master circle?
Yeah,

575
00:46:49,510 --> 00:46:53,430
like a maybe something since you've
already seen this. Only beyond this.

576
00:46:54,420 --> 00:46:58,290
Yeah. Maybe. Maybe. Maybe

577
00:47:02,970 --> 00:47:07,750
I have a question. Oh yes,
yes. Go ahead. In this setting,

578
00:47:07,751 --> 00:47:12,520
the beginning was just a, you
know, drawing, so everybody
started on the same page.

579
00:47:12,820 --> 00:47:16,690
What happens when you need to use more
mathematical notation or machinery?

580
00:47:17,020 --> 00:47:20,530
The people in the class may have different
levels of comfort with coming in to

581
00:47:20,531 --> 00:47:21,364
the circle.

582
00:47:21,870 --> 00:47:25,500
The kid should invent the notation
and the symbols themselves.

583
00:47:25,890 --> 00:47:30,890
Why use the inherited old
fashioned clouded symbols?

584
00:47:32,170 --> 00:47:36,010
Make your own all the daf to them.
The world will adapt to them.

585
00:47:36,340 --> 00:47:40,630
If you don't like writing fractions
this way.

586
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:46,720
Right? Some that way or

587
00:47:49,180 --> 00:47:52,900
that way or any way you choose as
long as you explain what you mean.

588
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:57,700
You mean that many of
those kinds of things,

589
00:47:57,940 --> 00:48:00,370
that many of those kinds of things.

590
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:03,460
11 of the seventeens.

591
00:48:04,090 --> 00:48:06,280
Whereas this

592
00:48:08,620 --> 00:48:13,480
would mean 17 of the 11 kind of things.
The numerator, it tells you the number.

593
00:48:13,900 --> 00:48:18,610
The denominator tells you
what the denomination, the
name. So I have a question.

594
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:19,650
Um hmm.

595
00:48:19,750 --> 00:48:24,750
One of the things that eventually
happened was we switched from can you be a

596
00:48:31,721 --> 00:48:33,160
challenge of

597
00:48:34,870 --> 00:48:39,250
many of us in the audience heard, can you
start from the second square as being,

598
00:48:39,670 --> 00:48:44,670
are you clever enough to come up with a
way to start from the second square and

599
00:48:45,460 --> 00:48:49,810
you know,
the process led to finally having to ask,

600
00:48:49,811 --> 00:48:54,280
can you be, can anyone,
is it possible? I'm

601
00:48:56,140 --> 00:48:58,450
curious whether that is

602
00:49:02,110 --> 00:49:03,590
having done this many times.
Do you,

603
00:49:03,591 --> 00:49:07,940
do you see that that is often a crux
that these things turn on and it was

604
00:49:08,610 --> 00:49:12,780
a crux on which the math
circle turns a fulcrum,

605
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:16,440
a widget balances,
self confidence and lack of it.

606
00:49:16,860 --> 00:49:20,730
One comes in as a human enter this
world and after just a little bit of

607
00:49:20,731 --> 00:49:22,710
experience loses one's nerve.

608
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:26,820
And so if it cannot be done this because
I can't do it until you begin to say,

609
00:49:26,821 --> 00:49:28,980
well, maybe, maybe nobody can do it.

610
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:31,830
A great British biologist,

611
00:49:32,310 --> 00:49:35,250
WBS Haldane in the 1930 he said,

612
00:49:35,940 --> 00:49:38,760
it may not be that the universe
is stranger than we think.

613
00:49:39,690 --> 00:49:43,320
It may be that it's stranger
than we can think. Well,

614
00:49:43,321 --> 00:49:45,300
what if this problem?

615
00:49:45,330 --> 00:49:49,770
What if it turned out we hadn't come
up with a solution and we came to the

616
00:49:49,771 --> 00:49:53,850
conclusion that, well, we've hit
the boundaries of human ability.

617
00:49:53,970 --> 00:49:58,050
We hit the limit of our ability
as you gain and self confidence,

618
00:49:58,440 --> 00:50:02,790
you say, listen, the world's
my oyster. I control this.

619
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:08,340
Mathematics is made by humans for humans.
If we can come off with a problem,

620
00:50:09,120 --> 00:50:13,950
we can answer it. Now, for those of you
who know some history of mathematics,

621
00:50:13,951 --> 00:50:18,951
you know that what I've just said is
a complete lie because in 1915 good,

622
00:50:20,291 --> 00:50:25,291
all of Austrian logician proved that there
are questions you can state and state

623
00:50:27,321 --> 00:50:29,390
very clearly and very well,

624
00:50:30,030 --> 00:50:33,290
which you will never be able to answer,

625
00:50:33,740 --> 00:50:38,150
which is devastating.
Now,

626
00:50:38,151 --> 00:50:41,450
the answer to good will is not.
Oh yeah.

627
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:47,920
But with mathematics as it's presently
understood with set theory as it's

628
00:50:49,041 --> 00:50:51,320
presently understood,
that is a limitation.

629
00:50:52,010 --> 00:50:53,780
But maybe the trouble is with set theory,

630
00:50:53,810 --> 00:50:56,300
maybe the trouble is with the
way we're posing the problem,

631
00:50:56,900 --> 00:51:01,900
maybe we just don't have our understanding
of those relations deep enough.

632
00:51:02,900 --> 00:51:07,160
Imagined enough yet.
Why shouldn't anything be our oyster?

633
00:51:07,460 --> 00:51:11,660
There was a mathematician in the 17th
century and Italian than Vhr who said,

634
00:51:11,870 --> 00:51:16,190
Nola gone problem. I saw Solaray there
is no problem that can't be solved.

635
00:51:16,191 --> 00:51:20,330
And so Sinai,
let me leave you all with a problem.

636
00:51:20,390 --> 00:51:21,830
This is not the end of the conversation,

637
00:51:21,831 --> 00:51:23,210
but let me just leave
you with this problem,

638
00:51:23,240 --> 00:51:26,690
all of you and email me
when you have some ideas.

639
00:51:28,100 --> 00:51:31,700
How many corners does a
10 dimensional cube have?

640
00:51:36,740 --> 00:51:41,570
Think about that. Send me an
answer. Three part question. Good.

641
00:51:42,300 --> 00:51:43,133
Ah,

642
00:51:43,540 --> 00:51:48,100
first part is, are you
thoroughly convinced that, uh,

643
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:53,760
the problem of starting the path on the
second square is impossible for all odd

644
00:51:55,561 --> 00:51:59,380
by odd squares and possible for all,
even by even squares.

645
00:52:00,190 --> 00:52:03,820
Are you asking if I'm convinced I math,
I might be asking the,

646
00:52:04,090 --> 00:52:06,650
the uh,
rest of the class.

647
00:52:06,730 --> 00:52:11,170
But um,
they shouldn't be because we did in 40,

648
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:15,820
50, 50 minutes. What's
deep complex problem.

649
00:52:16,120 --> 00:52:20,030
And we haven't talked about induction
if that's what's on your mind. Yeah,

650
00:52:20,110 --> 00:52:22,270
pretty much. Exactly. Once,

651
00:52:22,450 --> 00:52:27,450
and this brings up an answer to a question
someone else asked when I guess it a

652
00:52:27,670 --> 00:52:31,600
tall, when the symbolism, when
the concepts become deeper,

653
00:52:32,560 --> 00:52:35,590
when we come to grips with induction,
which we could do in 20 minutes,

654
00:52:36,100 --> 00:52:37,600
we can re ask that question,

655
00:52:37,720 --> 00:52:42,720
can you generalize even dimensional boards
and how can you know that a 10,984 by

656
00:52:45,461 --> 00:52:49,540
10,984 board and you can
start from anywhere on,

657
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:53,530
I mean it'd be really nice to
say, listen, piece of cake,

658
00:52:55,090 --> 00:52:55,923
Yo meal.

659
00:52:58,080 --> 00:53:01,150
This is just a pretty practical question,
a very interesting question,

660
00:53:01,151 --> 00:53:06,040
but I was curious as to why you decided
to start with a five by five grid

661
00:53:06,041 --> 00:53:08,550
instead of this three by three grid.
Uh,

662
00:53:08,590 --> 00:53:12,010
cause it seems like maybe some of the
conclusions that kids would have come up

663
00:53:12,011 --> 00:53:14,500
to might've been a little bit
faster given the time constraints.

664
00:53:14,530 --> 00:53:18,490
So I was wondering if there's a creativity
saying or like an exercise or I guess

665
00:53:19,150 --> 00:53:20,410
what led to that decision?

666
00:53:20,830 --> 00:53:21,880
Really good question.

667
00:53:22,150 --> 00:53:25,920
I started with something which I
knew was going to be beautiful,

668
00:53:25,921 --> 00:53:28,860
easy a piece of cake and we'd
all be tremendously confident,

669
00:53:29,310 --> 00:53:34,080
confident enough to look at a hard
aspect of it that hadn't been thought of.

670
00:53:34,530 --> 00:53:39,510
Stuart will it one by one and they
would have run out of the room saying,

671
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:40,271
what are you doing?

672
00:53:40,271 --> 00:53:45,060
And we of course you start in the middle
of a one by one and end with, yeah, okay.

673
00:53:45,330 --> 00:53:48,280
Or if I'd said 10 million by 10 million,
they were,

674
00:53:49,170 --> 00:53:53,820
I can't think in those terms.
Five by five sounds comfortable.

675
00:53:54,210 --> 00:53:59,010
It turns out that the springs in that
armchair or broken and you have to,

676
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:04,020
you feel uneasy and you get more and
more uneasy in it until it turns out,

677
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:08,280
oh, I know how to repair those
springs. I understand how it works,

678
00:54:08,460 --> 00:54:12,300
but you need an accessible mystery.

679
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:15,360
It's got to be appealing.
It's thought to be mysterious.

680
00:54:15,780 --> 00:54:20,760
We were asked to do a math circle in a
prison and we said, Oh, love to do that.

681
00:54:20,761 --> 00:54:24,860
We'll, we'll do it next year.
And they said, no, do it
next week. And he it. Well,

682
00:54:24,870 --> 00:54:28,020
we're very busy next, but you're
doing it Wednesdays. All right,

683
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:32,650
so Ellen and I went home and thought
on God, what are we going to do? Well,

684
00:54:32,651 --> 00:54:34,530
we'll make sure our wills are in order.

685
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:38,340
And we were worked out a
routine having the prison.

686
00:54:38,670 --> 00:54:40,530
It was a high security prison.

687
00:54:41,250 --> 00:54:45,750
If you've ever been inside or visiting,
it's very frightening.

688
00:54:45,751 --> 00:54:47,820
The guards are much more
frightening than the prisoners.

689
00:54:48,330 --> 00:54:50,130
All your belongings are taken away from.

690
00:54:50,131 --> 00:54:53,910
You would put in a drawer and there's
barbed wire on top of the walls. Anyway,

691
00:54:54,300 --> 00:54:59,300
we were put in a room and our guides left
and the room was small and the people

692
00:54:59,371 --> 00:55:02,610
were big.
They spend their time bodybuilding.

693
00:55:03,030 --> 00:55:07,260
There were a 17 I counted of them and
there were two of us up against the

694
00:55:07,261 --> 00:55:11,490
blackboard. They fill the floor. They
were sitting on the floor and we said,

695
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:16,950
this is the routine we'd worked
out. I said, math, it's awful,

696
00:55:16,951 --> 00:55:20,880
isn't it? Right on. They said,
Ellen said, yeah, you know,

697
00:55:20,881 --> 00:55:25,530
they ask you stupid questions like
what's one plus two? We fell silent,

698
00:55:26,340 --> 00:55:30,480
somebody says three, what do you take
us for? It's all of course it's three.

699
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:32,520
And then that day I said your,

700
00:55:32,570 --> 00:55:37,560
they ask them what's one plus two plus
three and voice over there six and then

701
00:55:37,590 --> 00:55:40,670
came words, which I will not
repeat it from the audience.

702
00:55:41,060 --> 00:55:44,220
And while I'm saying this,
Ellen has writing on the board,

703
00:55:44,221 --> 00:55:48,690
one plus two plus three plus four
all the way up to 20 and I said,

704
00:55:48,750 --> 00:55:51,510
and then they asked you a question like,
well what's all that out of two?

705
00:55:52,530 --> 00:55:54,210
And a guy got up and said,

706
00:55:55,110 --> 00:55:58,350
that's why I hate about this bath thing.

707
00:55:58,650 --> 00:56:03,330
They ask you a town full question that
nobody could ask her and get right.

708
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:07,890
And even if they did, what would they
come out with? Some stupid number.

709
00:56:08,490 --> 00:56:13,470
And we said right on, is that ever
right? Yeah. And then Ellen said,

710
00:56:14,610 --> 00:56:18,690
if only there were a, a a nice way of
doing it, a beautiful way of doing it.

711
00:56:19,420 --> 00:56:23,410
They said, I'll be out big
fat chance. I said, yeah,

712
00:56:23,411 --> 00:56:27,040
if it's just some, you know,
different way of counting it,

713
00:56:27,650 --> 00:56:31,780
voice over there,
you could do 10 bonds.

714
00:56:33,150 --> 00:56:37,630
That's what water 10 bonds told
about new terminology. So you know,

715
00:56:37,660 --> 00:56:42,010
one plus nine is 10 and and
three plus eight is 10 no,

716
00:56:42,011 --> 00:56:46,180
you idiot says this guy to pesetas
10 so we get 10 bonds. Yeah,

717
00:56:46,181 --> 00:56:50,380
we've gotten several,
well four or five 10 bonds,

718
00:56:50,420 --> 00:56:55,210
then we've run out of 10 bonds. So it was
that we would make 20 bonds, you know,

719
00:56:55,211 --> 00:56:59,770
one plus 19 said, no, we've already used
the one and the 10 votes. It's hopeless.

720
00:57:00,370 --> 00:57:01,510
And they're getting,

721
00:57:01,570 --> 00:57:05,020
they're getting a physically
quite restless and we're sweating.

722
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:09,880
And then a little guy at the back of the
room who hadn't said a word after that

723
00:57:09,881 --> 00:57:12,280
point said,
I know this is wrong,

724
00:57:12,281 --> 00:57:17,110
but which is always the preface to the
insight. He said, I know this is wrong,

725
00:57:18,040 --> 00:57:23,040
but one plus 20 is 21 and so as
two plus 19 and as a sheer luck,

726
00:57:25,180 --> 00:57:29,170
he said, no another voice. I said, no,
it's not sure a lot. They're all 20 ones.

727
00:57:30,390 --> 00:57:33,400
Why? What do you mean they're all
20 ones? They're all, they're all,

728
00:57:33,430 --> 00:57:37,450
all of them are 20 ones. Oh, what
if someone says all those numbers,

729
00:57:37,451 --> 00:57:41,200
all those 20 numbers are 21 no,
says a voiceover here.

730
00:57:41,380 --> 00:57:45,790
All those thingies are our
21 what do you mean thingies?

731
00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:49,150
The thingies?
Someone says pairs.

732
00:57:50,320 --> 00:57:53,680
All the pairs are 21 and I said,

733
00:57:54,280 --> 00:57:58,660
how many pairs are there?
Someone says, they're a tet 210

734
00:58:02,470 --> 00:58:06,280
high fives all around the room.
Can we do another? I said, yeah,

735
00:58:06,281 --> 00:58:07,180
what's was Ellen said,

736
00:58:07,181 --> 00:58:12,181
what's The sun from one to a hundred
it's a 5,050 give us another,

737
00:58:14,560 --> 00:58:19,390
we did this for awhile. At the end
they said, what do you call this?

738
00:58:19,780 --> 00:58:21,190
And we said math,

739
00:58:24,130 --> 00:58:28,060
start with something which is below,

740
00:58:28,061 --> 00:58:30,280
beneath the audience's dignity,

741
00:58:31,090 --> 00:58:33,190
and then hit them with the mystery,

742
00:58:34,210 --> 00:58:36,790
which turns out to be accessible,

743
00:58:38,110 --> 00:58:41,140
and they are slaves to math for life.

744
00:58:41,650 --> 00:58:46,650
[inaudible].
