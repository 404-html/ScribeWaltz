1
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:07,520
Thank you very much.
Well first of all,

2
00:00:07,521 --> 00:00:10,730
thank you to a Google for inviting me
here to speak to you and thank you for

3
00:00:10,731 --> 00:00:11,301
coming in.

4
00:00:11,301 --> 00:00:16,160
What do I suppose is your lunch time
to listen to math during a lunch break,

5
00:00:16,161 --> 00:00:17,240
which is pretty amazing.

6
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:22,340
So I am going to talk about logic and
about how to make sense in a world that

7
00:00:22,341 --> 00:00:25,610
doesn't because a lot of the world
does not make sense at the moment in

8
00:00:25,611 --> 00:00:28,790
particular. Many people don't seem to
make sense in the world at the moment.

9
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:34,090
And I have previously written books to
show how maths is fun and delicious and

10
00:00:35,331 --> 00:00:40,331
amazing and this is less about how it's
fun and more about how it's important

11
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:43,550
because the previous books
were about how it's important,

12
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:48,650
but recent events in the last couple of
years have driven me to feeling the need

13
00:00:48,651 --> 00:00:53,651
to say slightly more urgent and more dare
I say political things about how maths

14
00:00:54,231 --> 00:00:55,220
can help us.

15
00:00:55,580 --> 00:01:00,580
And this might be surprising because
usually pure maths is thought of as being

16
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:05,450
pure and remote. I am a pure
mathematician, I am a category theorist.

17
00:01:05,451 --> 00:01:08,990
That is my research and category theory
is sometimes thought of as the most

18
00:01:08,991 --> 00:01:11,180
abstract type of mathematics.
Well,

19
00:01:11,181 --> 00:01:15,080
I say that pure math is a
framework for agreeing on things,

20
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:20,030
but in general pure maths is often thought
of as really only being relevant to

21
00:01:20,031 --> 00:01:24,860
applied math and applied math is
then helpful to science possibly.

22
00:01:24,861 --> 00:01:28,700
And Science is helpful to engineering
and medicine and engineering and medicine

23
00:01:28,701 --> 00:01:33,410
are helpful to the world and maths is
helpful to kind of the numerical part of

24
00:01:33,411 --> 00:01:37,760
the world. And we might think
of differential equations
or solving equations and

25
00:01:37,761 --> 00:01:41,100
calculating things and finance
and science and business and,

26
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:45,230
and those are the ways in which math is
useful, but that enables people to say,

27
00:01:45,231 --> 00:01:48,620
well that's fine. I'm glad somebody
does that, but it doesn't have to be me.

28
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:50,510
It's not relevant to me.
Someone else can do it.

29
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,610
And I'm sure many of you do do it.

30
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:56,840
And there are many people in the world
who just ignore it and hope for the best.

31
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:57,830
Well,

32
00:01:57,830 --> 00:02:02,120
I say that actually because pure maths
is a framework for agreeing on things.

33
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:07,390
It's a framework for how to think well
and because it's about how to think,

34
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:13,190
it's actually about the entire human
world or at least the part of the human

35
00:02:13,191 --> 00:02:15,710
world that thinks,
which might not be all of it.

36
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:22,010
But once it be great if everyone were
able to think better. That's what I say.

37
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:27,280
And I truly believe that pure mathematics
is a discipline for thinking better

38
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,800
and for how to have better
arguments because I don't,

39
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:33,590
I'm not claiming to tell
everyone what to think,

40
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:37,340
but I wish we could have better arguments
because at the moment we seem to be

41
00:02:37,341 --> 00:02:41,840
myered in conflict device.
If for argument's fake news,

42
00:02:41,841 --> 00:02:46,410
yelling, bigotry, prejudice,
hate exploitation,

43
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:47,263
victim hood,

44
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:52,250
and it doesn't seem like it can sometimes
seem like there is not a productive

45
00:02:52,251 --> 00:02:53,210
way to have a discussion,

46
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:55,880
but I think there is a productive
way to have discussion.

47
00:02:55,940 --> 00:03:00,400
It just might not be on social media
necessarily, but maybe we can try.

48
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:02,530
And so this is what my book is about.

49
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,880
It's about how can we have more productive
conversations using lessons from

50
00:03:06,881 --> 00:03:07,870
abstract mathematics.

51
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:12,940
So I'm going to talk about analogies
and how pure maths uses analogies.

52
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:16,480
I'm going to talk about
the interconnectedness of
things and how we should

53
00:03:16,481 --> 00:03:18,490
always think about how
things are interconnected.

54
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:21,130
Going to talk about
relationships or various kinds.

55
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:25,480
I'm going to talk about pivoting between
different contexts so that we can help

56
00:03:25,481 --> 00:03:29,020
ourselves understand all the people
from their point of view. And finally,

57
00:03:29,021 --> 00:03:32,230
I'm going to talk about what I think
intelligence really actually is.

58
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:34,660
So first of all,
analogies,

59
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:38,020
I say that pure maths is a
framework for agreeing on things.

60
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:43,140
It's also a theory of analogies because
fundamentally what it says is there are

61
00:03:43,481 --> 00:03:46,180
lots of different situations
that have something in common.

62
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:49,210
If we just forget some of
the pesky details about them.

63
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:53,350
And then that takes us from the real
world of things into the abstract world of

64
00:03:53,351 --> 00:03:57,580
ideas where more things
become the same by analogy,

65
00:03:57,790 --> 00:04:02,560
but what pure maths does that we don't
necessarily do a normal life is we make

66
00:04:02,561 --> 00:04:04,210
very precise what the analogy is.

67
00:04:04,211 --> 00:04:07,300
We don't just say this thing
is analogous to that. We say,

68
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:10,330
what is the analogy that
we're thinking about here?

69
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:15,220
And that removes a lot of ambiguity
and having a framework for agreeing on

70
00:04:15,221 --> 00:04:18,220
things is partly about
removing possible ambiguity's.

71
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:21,280
So here is an example of how this works.
It's a very basic level.

72
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:24,670
If you think about two apples
and two bananas, then you can go,

73
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:26,410
oh these things have something in common.

74
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:30,160
They're both two things and
that's how we get the number two.

75
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:35,520
It's an analogy between a lot of different
sets of two things and when we first

76
00:04:35,591 --> 00:04:37,000
teach small children how to count,

77
00:04:37,001 --> 00:04:41,380
we have to wait for them to make that
abstract leap from the object in front of

78
00:04:41,381 --> 00:04:44,650
them to the concept.
And you can't really do that for them.

79
00:04:44,651 --> 00:04:47,770
You just have to sort of wait to show
them over and over again and wait until

80
00:04:47,771 --> 00:04:50,980
they make that leap.
It's a leap of abstraction.

81
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:54,400
Now there are other ways
we could have done this.

82
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:59,470
We could instead have said that they're
both two fruits, which is still true.

83
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:02,590
It just encompasses less stuff.

84
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:05,860
So if we had instead made
the analogy via two fruits,

85
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:10,120
then we would not be able to encompass
two chairs in this because that is not to

86
00:05:10,121 --> 00:05:12,760
fruits.
This doesn't mean it's a wrong analogy.

87
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:16,720
It just means it's an analogy to different
level that encompasses fewer things.

88
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:19,330
Whereas now if we go all
the way up to two things,

89
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:23,130
then we get to encompass the two
chairs as well. And pure maths.

90
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:27,430
A lots of pure math is about finding
the right level for the situation that

91
00:05:27,431 --> 00:05:27,731
you're in.

92
00:05:27,731 --> 00:05:32,200
It's not that there is one absolutely
right level maths as it turns out is not

93
00:05:32,201 --> 00:05:33,670
about getting the right answer.

94
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:37,600
It's about different points of view
that illuminates situations in different

95
00:05:37,601 --> 00:05:38,230
ways.

96
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:42,040
And I think arguments in life are often
not really about one person being right

97
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:45,220
and one person being wrong,
but a sense in which something is right.

98
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:49,750
So here is the sense in which two chairs
are not analogous to two bananas along

99
00:05:49,751 --> 00:05:51,670
with a sense in which they are.

100
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:54,940
And then once we've made precise
those two different levels,

101
00:05:54,941 --> 00:05:59,270
we can then have a discussion about which
one is a better level to use for the

102
00:05:59,271 --> 00:06:02,980
current discussion. And this happens
at a more profound level in maths.

103
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:07,970
When we think about say one plus two and
we compare that to two plus three and

104
00:06:07,971 --> 00:06:11,480
this is where that thing happens that
makes some people very scared where the

105
00:06:11,481 --> 00:06:16,481
numbers turn into letters and these
are both examples of a plus B,

106
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:19,790
but the point of doing that
is not to terrify everyone,

107
00:06:19,791 --> 00:06:22,430
although that can sometimes be
what it seems like the point,

108
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:26,600
the point is to encompass more examples.
That's always the idea of abstraction,

109
00:06:26,601 --> 00:06:30,710
to study a lot of different things at
the same time to save your brainpower and

110
00:06:30,711 --> 00:06:31,550
be more efficient,

111
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:34,730
and this is a good thing to do if you're
lazy like me and you don't want to do

112
00:06:34,731 --> 00:06:35,930
the same thing over and over again,

113
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:38,430
and I said lots of pure maths
comes from that. You've,

114
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:41,160
you do the same thing a few times and you
go, oh, I don't want to do that anymore.

115
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:43,220
I'm going to make a theory
that will do it for me.

116
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:46,910
So you kind of front load your effort and
then you never have to make the effort

117
00:06:46,911 --> 00:06:48,380
ever again like getting a dishwasher.

118
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:53,830
So this is very similar to one times
two and two times three which can be

119
00:06:55,611 --> 00:06:57,500
abstracted to a times B.

120
00:06:57,770 --> 00:07:01,140
But now we can say that whole left hand
part is analogous to the entire right

121
00:07:01,141 --> 00:07:06,110
hand part. And these are both
an example of a something.

122
00:07:06,111 --> 00:07:07,580
Be there aware of combining.

123
00:07:07,581 --> 00:07:12,260
So I'm a and some B and so we can go
even one level more abstract and say this

124
00:07:12,261 --> 00:07:17,261
is a blur B and it's a way
of combining two things.

125
00:07:17,751 --> 00:07:21,020
This is called a binary operation in
mathematics and it's one level more

126
00:07:21,021 --> 00:07:25,250
abstract that you probably only see if
you do an undergraduate degree in maths.

127
00:07:25,251 --> 00:07:28,250
And you do something like group theory
where you look at things with binary

128
00:07:28,251 --> 00:07:29,084
operations.

129
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:33,980
Now sometimes the top level is a really
good place to look and sometimes the

130
00:07:33,981 --> 00:07:37,700
middle level is a better place to look.
It just depends what you're trying to do.

131
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:42,530
So if you're thinking about something
like one plus two equals two plus one

132
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:45,230
which you might remember is the
Commuter Nativity of addition.

133
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,600
There's also a commuter
activity of multiplication,

134
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:52,340
which says that one times two equals two
times one and a times B equals B times

135
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:55,100
a.
And if we go up to the top level,

136
00:07:55,101 --> 00:07:59,120
we can study both of those
phenomena at the same time. However,

137
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:02,390
if we want to look at undoing the process,

138
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,760
we can't talk to the top
level because at that level,

139
00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:08,720
addition and multiplication aren't
the same because you can't always,

140
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:13,010
you can't always undo the process of
multiplication because if you multiply by

141
00:08:13,011 --> 00:08:16,700
zero, you can't undo that you're
done. Whereas whatever you add,

142
00:08:16,701 --> 00:08:18,380
you can always subtract
it to get back again.

143
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:22,280
You can divide by any number apart
from zero. And so at that level,

144
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:26,570
addition and multiplication on not
analogous. So we have to pick carefully.

145
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:31,790
And the main point of talking about this
is to show that making precise which

146
00:08:31,791 --> 00:08:36,791
level we're talking about helps us to
be clear about what's going to be useful

147
00:08:37,251 --> 00:08:42,080
now and what isn't isn't
true in in that context.

148
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:46,160
So a more real life example.

149
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:48,290
And my book is full of actual life.

150
00:08:48,291 --> 00:08:52,100
Examples of things that people argue
about on the Internet all the time is when

151
00:08:52,101 --> 00:08:54,350
a straight marriage and
gay marriage or analogous.

152
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:58,860
So people say that they do not believe
that gay people should be allowed to

153
00:08:58,861 --> 00:09:02,160
marry each other because they think that
marriage should be between a man and a

154
00:09:02,161 --> 00:09:07,050
woman. Now that is not
exactly an illogical argument,

155
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:10,560
but it's also not a very profound argument
because all they've really done is

156
00:09:10,561 --> 00:09:12,240
said the same thing twice.

157
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:17,570
So if I say I like orange juice
because I like orange juice,

158
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:21,270
but it's not illogical,
it just hasn't got anywhere at all.

159
00:09:21,271 --> 00:09:22,290
You haven't achieved anything.

160
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:27,600
And so just being logical versus illogical
is not the be all and end all of what

161
00:09:27,601 --> 00:09:29,220
an intelligent person should try and do.

162
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:33,570
What we should try and do is actually
make progress and gain understanding,

163
00:09:33,571 --> 00:09:36,270
not just say the same thing over and
over again with slightly different words.

164
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:41,480
So the sense in which these two things
are not analogous is if you do think that

165
00:09:41,791 --> 00:09:45,690
marriage is about an unrelated man and
woman and then it is true that same sex

166
00:09:45,691 --> 00:09:47,910
marriage does not come under that.
However,

167
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:50,580
if you think that it is
about two unrelated adults,

168
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:52,530
then same sex marriage
does come under that.

169
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,640
And the question shouldn't be whether
those things are the same or not.

170
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:59,790
There's questions should be which level
is a good level for us to consider.

171
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:04,170
Now the next thing that happens if you
go as far as this is that somebody will

172
00:10:04,171 --> 00:10:06,960
get really upset and say,
oh well the next thing you know we're,

173
00:10:06,961 --> 00:10:08,160
we'll be allowing incest.

174
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:12,060
And so what they've done is they've gone
up a further level and going up to the

175
00:10:12,061 --> 00:10:15,600
level of two adults and then
the next thing you know,

176
00:10:15,601 --> 00:10:19,860
you could go up to the level of just two
humans and then the next thing you know,

177
00:10:19,861 --> 00:10:24,861
you could go up to the level of two living
creatures and then you could just go

178
00:10:25,111 --> 00:10:27,270
up to the level of two creatures.

179
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,540
This is the slide that
could have been redacted.

180
00:10:33,541 --> 00:10:36,990
Have there been any minors in the room?
Now,

181
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:40,230
all of these levels are logically valid.

182
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:43,680
I would argue that some of them
are not very morally valid,

183
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:48,210
but that's a different question and what
is certainly not logically valid is to

184
00:10:48,211 --> 00:10:51,750
claim that just because somebody
has accepted this level,

185
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:56,130
some people claim that means that you've
accepted all the other levels and that

186
00:10:56,131 --> 00:11:00,600
is not logically valid. So once we've
made precise what all these levels are,

187
00:11:00,601 --> 00:11:04,200
we can now have a discussion about which
level anyone thinks that we should go

188
00:11:04,201 --> 00:11:07,230
up too. But we should not
conflate all the different levels.

189
00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:10,830
And the trouble with not making those
levels precise is that somebody can

190
00:11:10,831 --> 00:11:11,700
hallucinate,

191
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:16,140
willfully or otherwise that somebody
else has shot all the way up to the top

192
00:11:16,141 --> 00:11:16,974
when they haven't.

193
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:21,690
So this is one of the advantages I
think of the precision of abstract

194
00:11:21,691 --> 00:11:22,524
mathematics.

195
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:27,180
I'd now like to move on to talking
about the interconnectedness of things

196
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,970
because everything is interconnected.

197
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,400
Unfortunately,

198
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:37,020
many people often like to blame exactly
one thing or exactly one person or one

199
00:11:37,021 --> 00:11:40,680
group of people.
And that is a way to simplify situations.

200
00:11:40,681 --> 00:11:42,930
But I don't think it's a very good way.
And yes,

201
00:11:42,931 --> 00:11:47,100
we are all trying to make
sense of a complicated world
and that requires somehow

202
00:11:47,101 --> 00:11:48,060
simplifying the world,

203
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,960
but just ignoring huge quantities of it
is not a great way of doing it. I think.

204
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:56,290
I think that a better way of doing it is
to become more intelligent because then

205
00:11:56,291 --> 00:11:59,810
the world becomes simpler relative to
your intelligence and then new simplified

206
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:00,653
the world.

207
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:05,110
So here is one of my favorite
diagrams of interconnectedness.

208
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:09,130
We will know this picture. It's not
a geographically accurate picture.

209
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:11,360
It doesn't show geographical location.

210
00:12:11,361 --> 00:12:15,130
And what it shows is the
interconnectedness of stations
by different two blinds.

211
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:18,790
And this is all we need to know if we're
trying to get from one tube station to

212
00:12:18,791 --> 00:12:20,770
another.
Once we are in the train,

213
00:12:20,771 --> 00:12:24,610
we don't really need to know exactly
where the tunnel goes necessarily.

214
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:28,370
We just need to know where it's
going to pop out out. And uh,

215
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:32,620
this does mean the hapless tourists
sometimes find themselves taking the tube

216
00:12:32,621 --> 00:12:35,830
ridiculous distance because they didn't
realize that actually if they just went

217
00:12:35,831 --> 00:12:37,570
above ground,
it was two minutes walk that way.

218
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:42,880
This is an abstract picture because it's
just showing the interconnectedness of

219
00:12:42,881 --> 00:12:45,700
things.
This is the geographical tumor picture.

220
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:50,080
It is much harder to understand if you're
trying to use it to get from a to B,

221
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,850
but that doesn't mean it's worthless.

222
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:55,270
It's quite interesting to see where the
tube lines actually go and to see where

223
00:12:55,271 --> 00:12:56,980
the tube stations really are in London.

224
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:00,790
I think so it's not that one of these
is right and one of them is wrong.

225
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:04,330
It's just that it depends what you're
trying to achieve and that depending on

226
00:13:04,331 --> 00:13:05,290
what you're trying to achieve,

227
00:13:05,291 --> 00:13:07,960
you should look at the things that are
relevant to the thing you're trying to

228
00:13:07,961 --> 00:13:12,430
achieve or understand and then be able
to switch between thinking about relevant

229
00:13:12,431 --> 00:13:15,790
these things in this situation and
those things in that situation,

230
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,120
and that's one of the things that
abstract mathematics does a lot is that it

231
00:13:19,121 --> 00:13:22,630
doesn't say this is actually the
full explanation of this situation.

232
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:27,660
It says here is an explanation of an
aspect of this situation and in another on

233
00:13:27,731 --> 00:13:29,650
another day when we're
worrying about something else,

234
00:13:29,651 --> 00:13:31,030
we can think about another aspect.

235
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:37,600
Relationship breakdown is something that
involves a lot of interconnectedness

236
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:42,580
and also a lot of blame.
And often when relationships break down,

237
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:46,090
everyone blames one person and then the
other people all blame the other person.

238
00:13:46,091 --> 00:13:49,690
So often people take sides and often
the people in the relationship breakdown

239
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:50,553
tech sites.

240
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:55,030
Now there are situations where it might
really be one person's fault in cases of

241
00:13:55,031 --> 00:13:56,260
extreme domestic abuse.

242
00:13:56,650 --> 00:14:01,330
But usually it's about a breakdown
of things going in both directions.

243
00:14:01,331 --> 00:14:03,340
And here's an example
of how I think about it.

244
00:14:03,341 --> 00:14:08,341
Sometimes supposing Alex is someone who
doesn't like feeling disrespected and if

245
00:14:09,101 --> 00:14:10,660
Alex feels disrespected,

246
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:15,530
then Alex is unable to show love
and there may be Alex's partner.

247
00:14:15,531 --> 00:14:20,410
Sam is someone who really likes to
feel loved. And if Sam feels unloved,

248
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:23,200
then Sam is unable to show respect,

249
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:28,150
in which case Alex feels disrespected
and we get in this cycle and it can get

250
00:14:28,151 --> 00:14:31,690
worse and worse and worse. Now I can
classify these arrows in different ways.

251
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:32,421
So these are,

252
00:14:32,421 --> 00:14:35,980
these are errors about action that
people take in response to something.

253
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:39,610
And these arrows are about feelings that
people have in response to something.

254
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:42,250
And this can get into a
very bad vicious cycle.

255
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:45,070
Once we've seen it's this vicious cycle.

256
00:14:45,071 --> 00:14:46,870
By the end of the
connectedness of these arrows,

257
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:49,150
we can think about how to break the cycle.

258
00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:51,630
We can think about which of
these arrows is the easy,

259
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:54,710
the weakest one that we could break.
We can think about whether it's diff,

260
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:57,530
more difficult to change your
feelings or your actions.

261
00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:00,530
I think it's harder to change
feelings because feelings just are,

262
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:03,440
you just respond to things, but you
don't have to act on those feelings.

263
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:06,620
But some other people think that they
can't stop themselves acting on those

264
00:15:06,621 --> 00:15:08,330
feelings,
so they have to change their feelings.

265
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:12,230
But at least we can then have a clear
discussion about what's going on in this

266
00:15:12,231 --> 00:15:13,064
situation.

267
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:18,370
Now there's an analogous situation that
is to say it makes the same picture

268
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:22,140
that's possibly more urgents,

269
00:15:22,141 --> 00:15:24,770
which is about police
violence against black people.

270
00:15:24,771 --> 00:15:27,150
This is a particular issue in America,
um,

271
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,750
where we have another vicious
circle that looks like this,

272
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:34,010
that involves maybe police who
feel threatened by black people,

273
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:38,300
and that means that they aggressively
defend themselves against black people.

274
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:41,930
But in turn that means that black people
feel very threatened by the police,

275
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:45,350
which means that black people aggressively
defend themselves against the police,

276
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:48,800
which means that police feel
threatened by black people, and again,

277
00:15:48,801 --> 00:15:53,540
this separates out into feeling responses
and action responses and once we've

278
00:15:53,541 --> 00:15:56,240
observed that there is this
interconnectedness of causes,

279
00:15:56,450 --> 00:15:59,090
then we can have I think a
more productive argument.

280
00:15:59,091 --> 00:16:02,690
Instead of half the people on
the Internet yelling, well,

281
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:05,330
they should just do what the police told
him and then they won't get shot and

282
00:16:05,331 --> 00:16:08,180
the other half saying, well, the
deletion shoot them. That's one birth.

283
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:10,850
I think that we can look at this
interconnectedness and saying,

284
00:16:10,851 --> 00:16:12,680
there are many things going on now.

285
00:16:12,681 --> 00:16:14,720
Whose responsibility is
it to change something?

286
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:17,900
I think in this situation and
in a relationship breakdown,

287
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:22,010
whoever has more power in the situation
should take the responsibility for

288
00:16:22,011 --> 00:16:25,130
changing it, but maybe some
people disagree with me at least.

289
00:16:25,131 --> 00:16:28,760
Then we can talk about really what we
disagree with rather than having futile

290
00:16:28,761 --> 00:16:30,530
shouting matches across the internet.

291
00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:36,800
I use the interconnectedness of
things to help me understand difficult

292
00:16:36,801 --> 00:16:40,280
situations that have arisen when people
are yelling about exactly who is to

293
00:16:40,281 --> 00:16:40,880
blame.

294
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:45,410
So one case where I drew a diagram that
looks like a category theory diagram to

295
00:16:45,411 --> 00:16:50,411
me was in the egregious United incident
or other after the egregious United

296
00:16:50,721 --> 00:16:55,160
incident when the flight was overbooked
and they picked someone to kick off the

297
00:16:55,161 --> 00:16:58,280
plane and he didn't want to go.
And so they called security,

298
00:16:58,281 --> 00:17:01,430
they hauled him off extremely violently
and he sustained quite serious injuries

299
00:17:01,431 --> 00:17:04,730
on the way out. Uh, which point
half the Internet went well,

300
00:17:04,731 --> 00:17:06,890
he should have just left when he was old,
then he wouldn't get injured.

301
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:09,330
And the other half the internet
said, well, you should,

302
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:12,200
they shouldn't just beat people up
because they didn't want to leave a play.

303
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:15,860
And some people said it was
just one person's fault.

304
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:18,650
Some people said it was just something
else, but it was really a lot of things.

305
00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:22,460
And there was even an editorial by,
uh,

306
00:17:22,461 --> 00:17:26,270
an a British journalist who I probably
shouldn't name since this is going on the

307
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:30,800
internet, but who wrote an editorial
saying it's all of your faults,

308
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:35,950
yours because your sometimes late for
flights and that means that they overbook

309
00:17:36,981 --> 00:17:40,640
flights in case people are late and it's
because of that overbooking that they

310
00:17:40,641 --> 00:17:41,840
had to get someone off the plane.

311
00:17:41,841 --> 00:17:45,920
So it's actually your fault for
being late for a flight. I thought,

312
00:17:45,921 --> 00:17:48,050
well that's pushing it a bit far.
Maybe.

313
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:52,860
Maybe there is some kind of a point.
So what kind of a point is there? Well,

314
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:58,020
the editor result was the injury was
caused, right? Why was the injury?

315
00:17:58,021 --> 00:17:58,471
Because well,

316
00:17:58,471 --> 00:18:02,160
the guy refused to leave the plane
and also the security used force.

317
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:05,430
But the security won't even have been
there unless the airline had called

318
00:18:05,431 --> 00:18:06,660
security in the first place.

319
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:11,700
Right now he refused to leave
because he needed to get to work.

320
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:15,750
But um, why did the airline even
choose him in the first place?

321
00:18:15,751 --> 00:18:17,280
You could say he was a
doctor at the hospital.

322
00:18:17,281 --> 00:18:20,010
He had a very valid reason to want to
get to work. Why did they pick him?

323
00:18:20,011 --> 00:18:23,100
There are questions about whether
there was racial profiling.

324
00:18:23,101 --> 00:18:26,190
Why did they pick those particular people?
Then there was,

325
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,860
why did they even need to kick
people off in the first place?

326
00:18:28,861 --> 00:18:32,760
Who's fault was that? Well, nobody
volunteered. Why didn't nobody volunteer?

327
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:34,860
The airline offered them too little money.

328
00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:38,890
Are they being stingy or why did
they really want to get home? Um,

329
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,880
why did they even decide to
remove people in the first place?

330
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:43,230
That was because the flight was to fold.

331
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:46,800
The flight was too far and they
needed to get some crew to Lewisville.

332
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:49,350
Why do they need to get some
crew to Lewisville so badly?

333
00:18:49,351 --> 00:18:52,770
Was it some scheduling issue
and why was the flight to full?

334
00:18:52,771 --> 00:18:55,530
Partly because it was overbooked and
partly because there was not enough.

335
00:18:55,531 --> 00:18:57,330
No shows.
Now who's fault is that?

336
00:18:57,331 --> 00:19:00,510
Is it the airline's fault for overbooking
or is it the people's fault for not

337
00:19:00,511 --> 00:19:02,460
showing up?
It's both of those things.

338
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,130
And then finally there's the
people often miss flights,

339
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:08,040
which is a very tenuous
contribution to this situation.

340
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:13,220
But I think that changing any one of
those factors would have changed the

341
00:19:13,891 --> 00:19:14,580
outcome.

342
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:17,940
But it doesn't mean that any one of those
factors by themselves is individually

343
00:19:17,941 --> 00:19:22,740
to blame. It's really the
interconnectedness of the
whole system. So another,

344
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:26,490
another situation where people
often go, oh, it's really simple.

345
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:29,040
Whenever people say that,
it really usually isn't that simple.

346
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,690
It might be simple in a different way,

347
00:19:30,691 --> 00:19:32,790
but it's rarely simple in the
way that people are saying.

348
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:35,820
And one is when they
talk about losing weight.

349
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:41,060
So I used to be quite fat and I lost 50
pounds and I would like to leave it in

350
00:19:41,561 --> 00:19:44,370
that way. And so I think quite a lot
about this because it's quite an effort.

351
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,430
And then periodically someone will go,
oh well it's not rocket Thrones.

352
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:51,990
You just have to eat less and
exercise more. And I say, well,

353
00:19:51,991 --> 00:19:54,240
even rocket science,
it's just applied maths.

354
00:19:57,690 --> 00:20:02,160
So why do I put on weight? Well, I put
on weight because I take it more energy,

355
00:20:02,161 --> 00:20:06,900
then I burn. And that's because I eat too
much. And because I exercise too little.

356
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:10,260
But it's also because of my metabolism.
And what affects my metabolism?

357
00:20:10,261 --> 00:20:12,300
Well my mum,
the metabolism slows down.

358
00:20:12,301 --> 00:20:14,730
If I eat too little and
I exercise too much.

359
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:18,600
So already we have the fact that I gained
weight because I eat too much and too

360
00:20:18,601 --> 00:20:22,350
little. Am I exercising too
much and too little? So yes,

361
00:20:22,351 --> 00:20:26,370
it's very simple situation together with
the fact that why is my metabolism like

362
00:20:26,371 --> 00:20:30,300
that's also some genetics.
The amount of sleep I do and don't get.

363
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:33,880
And why do I eat too much?
I really like food. Um,

364
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:38,460
but also because emotions I emotionally
eat right. And why do I eat too much?

365
00:20:38,461 --> 00:20:41,340
Well, why do I eat too much because
of emotions. Some people don't.

366
00:20:41,341 --> 00:20:44,760
It's partly to do with my genetics and
partly to do with my upbringing where we

367
00:20:44,761 --> 00:20:48,190
definitely had an emotional
connection to food when I was up. Um,

368
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:51,100
and there's also social
pressure to eat too much.

369
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:53,170
And some people say you can't
blame everyone else all the time,

370
00:20:53,171 --> 00:20:54,850
but let's look at all the factors.

371
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:58,120
There is social pressure to eat too much
because people get bored with you if

372
00:20:58,121 --> 00:21:00,400
you don't join in stuffing
your face when they are.

373
00:21:01,910 --> 00:21:06,160
The social norms also causes emotions
that cause me to eat too much.

374
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:08,350
Then there's also time pressure.
If I'm very busy,

375
00:21:08,351 --> 00:21:12,640
I get stressed and I also sleep less
and there's also life that holds his

376
00:21:12,641 --> 00:21:16,990
emotions and then there's
also the entire food industry,

377
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:19,840
so there's a multibillion
food in this mouth,

378
00:21:19,841 --> 00:21:23,590
multibillion pound food industry that
is trying to get us to eat too much

379
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:27,550
because that's how they make money and
they're also trying to get us to want to

380
00:21:27,551 --> 00:21:31,570
lose weight and to try and lose weight
and fail so that they can carry on with

381
00:21:31,571 --> 00:21:36,490
the Diet Industry that doesn't really
achieve anything and so advertising and so

382
00:21:36,491 --> 00:21:37,020
on.

383
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:40,870
It causes us to eat too much and then
they make money out of us and so it's kind

384
00:21:40,871 --> 00:21:43,180
of money. Maybe it's money
that's at the root of everything.

385
00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:46,510
Then there's the fact
that if I do gain weight,

386
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:49,840
then I try and eat less and slow too
much and I get stressed about it.

387
00:21:50,050 --> 00:21:55,030
And so I get all of these vicious
cycles and interconnectedness and a

388
00:21:55,031 --> 00:21:59,110
conglomeration of factors. So now try and
tell me that it really is that simple.

389
00:21:59,770 --> 00:22:02,920
I don't think it really is that simple,
but it really is this simple.

390
00:22:03,130 --> 00:22:06,900
And the point is if you get used to
understanding interconnected networks of

391
00:22:06,901 --> 00:22:09,760
factors, then this actually
is simple. The whole thing.

392
00:22:09,761 --> 00:22:14,230
You don't have to forget huge parts of
the diagram in order to make it simple.

393
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:18,100
Your brain can comprehend this as a
single unit and that's what I mean by

394
00:22:18,101 --> 00:22:20,410
becoming more intelligent in
order to make things simpler.

395
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:26,160
I did draw a diagram for the 2016 us
election because it's a classic case of

396
00:22:28,571 --> 00:22:31,810
people yelling at each other about
who's fault it is. Here's my diagram.

397
00:22:33,670 --> 00:22:35,230
I'm not going to leave
it up for very long.

398
00:22:35,231 --> 00:22:40,120
But I did find it very helpful for me
to put all of these different factors in

399
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:42,670
and understand why people
are yelling at say,

400
00:22:42,671 --> 00:22:46,180
so there are some people who just say
it's entire fault of the third party

401
00:22:46,181 --> 00:22:47,014
voters.

402
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:50,950
But what they don't realize is that that
the people voting third party wouldn't

403
00:22:50,951 --> 00:22:53,320
have made a difference if the
voting system were different.

404
00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:57,040
So it's people voting third party and the
fact that they're voting system is the

405
00:22:57,041 --> 00:22:58,450
way it is and so on.

406
00:22:58,690 --> 00:23:03,310
So this to me is the logic
inside the situation.

407
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:07,960
Working out why each of these things
was there in the first place is more the

408
00:23:07,961 --> 00:23:09,460
politics or the sociology of it.

409
00:23:09,670 --> 00:23:14,590
But understanding the logic of the
interconnectedness right at the outset can

410
00:23:14,591 --> 00:23:17,800
help us start to think about
all of the other issues.

411
00:23:17,801 --> 00:23:20,320
It's definitely not
the full understanding,

412
00:23:20,530 --> 00:23:22,720
but it makes it so much clearer to me.

413
00:23:22,721 --> 00:23:25,960
And it means that I can see what's going
on with other people's arguments about

414
00:23:25,961 --> 00:23:26,794
it.

415
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:31,720
I'd now like to talk about
relationships between things.

416
00:23:31,721 --> 00:23:34,270
I mentioned relationships
between people just now,

417
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:37,960
but a lot of what I've been talking about
in the previous section was about how

418
00:23:37,961 --> 00:23:40,420
things are interconnected
by different relationships.

419
00:23:40,630 --> 00:23:42,160
And actually my field of research,

420
00:23:42,161 --> 00:23:46,220
which is category theory is all about
studying relationships with between things

421
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,560
instead of their
intrinsic characteristics.

422
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:52,910
And so I've learned a lot from this and
my brain is very geared towards thinking

423
00:23:52,911 --> 00:23:54,680
about relationships between things a lot.

424
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:58,760
And I realized that it can apply to many
important things in the world around us.

425
00:23:59,030 --> 00:24:01,280
But starting from something quite banal,

426
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:06,230
like the factors of 30 so this
is obviously mathematical.

427
00:24:06,231 --> 00:24:09,530
Maybe we can remember what the
factors of 13 oh they are one

428
00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:14,690
and two three five,

429
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:20,520
six 10 15

430
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,820
I'm 30 very good.
It's not very interesting.

431
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:26,250
It's a bunch of numbers
in a straight line.

432
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:28,710
And we live in a three dimensional world.

433
00:24:28,711 --> 00:24:31,710
So we write on two dimensional pieces
of paper and one dimensional straight

434
00:24:31,711 --> 00:24:32,400
lines,

435
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:35,610
which means that we stuff all our thoughts
into a one dimensional straight line

436
00:24:35,611 --> 00:24:36,360
all the time.

437
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:38,970
And sometimes they don't want to be
in a one dimensional straight line.

438
00:24:39,150 --> 00:24:40,230
They have natural geometry.

439
00:24:40,231 --> 00:24:43,920
And higher dimensions and I like to say
this is why I don't tidy the papers on

440
00:24:43,921 --> 00:24:46,560
my desk because they have natural
geometry in higher dimensions.

441
00:24:46,890 --> 00:24:48,750
They don't want to be stuffed
until one dimensional points.

442
00:24:48,930 --> 00:24:53,930
So I'm going to exhibit the natural
geometry of this situation or find some by

443
00:24:54,001 --> 00:24:56,640
looking at which numbers are
also factors of each other.

444
00:24:57,060 --> 00:25:00,510
And I'm going to draw something a
bit like a family tree to show those

445
00:25:00,511 --> 00:25:02,970
relationships.
So like in a family tree,

446
00:25:02,971 --> 00:25:06,870
I don't need to show relationships across
two generations because we can deduce

447
00:25:06,871 --> 00:25:08,970
those.
So we have 30 at the top,

448
00:25:08,971 --> 00:25:13,500
like a kind of great grandparents and
then we have six 10 and 15 that go into 30

449
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:18,740
we have five goes into 10 and 15 two
goes into six and ten three goes into six

450
00:25:19,411 --> 00:25:21,750
and 15 and one goes into two,

451
00:25:21,751 --> 00:25:25,980
three and five so now we see
that it's the corners of a cube.

452
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:30,870
We can also see a hierarchy going on
here because you might notice that one is

453
00:25:30,871 --> 00:25:33,150
at the bottom because it's the smallest.
And then two,

454
00:25:33,151 --> 00:25:36,330
three and five are directly above it
because nothing else goes into them apart

455
00:25:36,331 --> 00:25:40,710
from one which is that their
prime numbers. And then
the other level above that,

456
00:25:40,711 --> 00:25:44,190
we have product of two prime numbers
and then at the top we have products or

457
00:25:44,191 --> 00:25:45,890
three products are three 12 prime numbers.

458
00:25:45,890 --> 00:25:49,530
So we have a hierarchy according to the
number of prime factors that each number

459
00:25:49,531 --> 00:25:53,490
has. And if I draw out a picture
of the num of the prime factors,

460
00:25:53,491 --> 00:25:56,340
instead I get this.
So at the bottom it's the empty set,

461
00:25:56,341 --> 00:26:00,900
there are no prime factors. And then
one prime factor pairs of prime factors.

462
00:26:00,901 --> 00:26:01,800
And then three,

463
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:05,610
and we can get back to the left hand
diagram by just multiplying together all

464
00:26:05,611 --> 00:26:06,930
the numbers at each corner.

465
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:11,760
But now maybe we can see it didn't
really matter what those numbers were.

466
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:15,450
In fact, it didn't really matter what they
were at all. They could have been a, B,

467
00:26:15,451 --> 00:26:17,720
and c. So we've turned on
numbers, intellectual, Ooh.

468
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:23,180
And now we have arrows that show
forgetting one thing from each set.

469
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:29,360
So this is also called subset interaction
but this is now it's very powerful

470
00:26:30,271 --> 00:26:31,130
because we can,

471
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:35,370
we can try it with something else so we
could switch to doing the factors of 42

472
00:26:35,730 --> 00:26:39,120
and we can draw a diagram similarly where
we start with one and then the prime

473
00:26:39,121 --> 00:26:40,470
factors two,
three and seven.

474
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:44,310
Then the product of two prime factors and
the product, three time prime factors.

475
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:48,900
We can redraw the other diagrams and you
can see that the right hand one is just

476
00:26:48,901 --> 00:26:50,340
a, B and c. It's the same.

477
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:54,990
The middle one looks very similar except
that seven has been put in place of

478
00:26:54,991 --> 00:26:58,410
every five. So once we get as far
obstructors the right hand side,

479
00:26:58,411 --> 00:27:02,790
it's become the same picture. It looks
less and less the same towards the left.

480
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:05,970
And this is the point of obstruction
that many things become the same.

481
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:09,060
And there is a particular feature about
the left hand diagram that I want to

482
00:27:09,061 --> 00:27:13,500
point out which is that
six is less than seven.

483
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:15,420
Now that might not sound very profound,

484
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:20,520
but notice that six is higher than seven
in the diagram but six is less than

485
00:27:20,521 --> 00:27:23,400
seven in the normal
hierarchy of size of numbers.

486
00:27:23,610 --> 00:27:26,310
So there is a difference.

487
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:30,900
There is a tension between the hierarchy
in this diagram and the just sheer size

488
00:27:30,901 --> 00:27:35,901
of numbers and that is something that's
going to be crucial in the next couple

489
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:41,600
of minutes as we move on because now I'm
going to show that this has become very

490
00:27:41,971 --> 00:27:45,660
powerful at the abstract level because a,
B and c can be anything.

491
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:49,140
They don't have to be numbers, they
can be anything. So for example,

492
00:27:49,141 --> 00:27:52,560
they can be three types of
privilege, rich, white and male.

493
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:56,640
And then at the next level down we'll
have people with two types of privilege,

494
00:27:56,740 --> 00:28:00,240
rich and white,
rich and male and white male.

495
00:28:00,510 --> 00:28:03,750
And then at the next level down just rich,
white or male.

496
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:06,330
And then at the bottom people with
none of those types of privilege.

497
00:28:06,630 --> 00:28:10,950
And if I put back in the other words for
emphasis, we have rich, white, non men.

498
00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:15,750
We have rich, non white
men. We have poor white men.

499
00:28:15,810 --> 00:28:18,720
I should have said non rich
but it doesn't fit sideways.

500
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:23,430
So I said well we have rich,
non white non men,

501
00:28:23,730 --> 00:28:28,730
poor white non men and poor nonwhite
men and at the bottom poor non white non

502
00:28:29,521 --> 00:28:30,330
men.

503
00:28:30,330 --> 00:28:35,330
So we have gone from a diagram of factors
of 30 to a diagram of interaction,

504
00:28:35,431 --> 00:28:39,000
of different types of privilege and there
are many things I think we can learn

505
00:28:39,001 --> 00:28:39,900
from this diagram.

506
00:28:40,290 --> 00:28:45,290
The first is that each Arrow represents
a direct loss of one type of privilege

507
00:28:45,810 --> 00:28:50,810
and it doesn't mean that all the people
who are white are better off than all

508
00:28:51,511 --> 00:28:52,740
the people who are not white.

509
00:28:52,741 --> 00:28:57,741
Because you can see along the second
level that there are some people with no

510
00:28:57,961 --> 00:29:01,320
errors in between them. So there is no
direct loss of privilege along that level.

511
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:05,130
Now this is something that people make
a mistake about when they're getting

512
00:29:05,131 --> 00:29:08,790
angry about the theory of privilege
because people sometimes point it a super

513
00:29:08,791 --> 00:29:13,200
rich black sports store and say, look
at that really rich black person. See,

514
00:29:13,201 --> 00:29:16,860
white privilege doesn't exist,
but that's not what white privilege means.

515
00:29:17,010 --> 00:29:20,490
White privilege in the theory of white
privilege means that if that's super rich,

516
00:29:20,491 --> 00:29:25,350
black sports star had all
the same features but was
also white, then they would,

517
00:29:25,351 --> 00:29:28,990
we would expect them to be better off
in society and so it's not about the,

518
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:33,470
it's not trying to say that every white
person is better off than every norm

519
00:29:33,471 --> 00:29:34,304
white person.

520
00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:39,000
It's about losing one type of privilege
along one of these arrows and how that

521
00:29:39,001 --> 00:29:40,440
affects people's experiences.

522
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:43,990
Now that's something else I think we can
learn from this if we just look along

523
00:29:43,991 --> 00:29:48,280
the second row of people who are level
having two types of privilege each

524
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:52,220
because I don't think that they're
really level in terms of absolutely

525
00:29:52,221 --> 00:29:56,380
privileged in society.
If we think about rich white women,

526
00:29:56,710 --> 00:30:00,160
I think we can probably agree that they're
better off in society than say rich

527
00:30:00,161 --> 00:30:04,390
black men who are in turn better off
than poor white men because it turns out

528
00:30:04,391 --> 00:30:08,170
that money can mitigate for an
awful lot of other problems.

529
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:13,000
So actually it's more skewed like this.
And the same is true on the bottom level,

530
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:16,780
although actually I think it's skewed
further than that because if we look at

531
00:30:16,781 --> 00:30:19,600
the interaction between the
the two levels in the middle,

532
00:30:19,810 --> 00:30:22,000
I think we might be
able to agree that rich,

533
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:26,680
non white non men are probably better
off in society than poor white men.

534
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:30,040
Because again,
riches mitigate for many things.

535
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:35,020
And if we think about some extreme cases
like Michelle Obama or Oprah Winfrey,

536
00:30:35,290 --> 00:30:37,930
I'm sure we'll all agree that there
are much better off than poor white

537
00:30:37,990 --> 00:30:41,170
unemployed homeless men in the middle
of nowhere in America for example.

538
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:45,130
So actually it skewed more like this
and it's just like the fact that six is

539
00:30:45,131 --> 00:30:45,964
less than seven.

540
00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:50,310
So six was at a higher
level in terms of the cube,

541
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:55,340
but it was lower in absolute terms and
seven and poor white men have two types

542
00:30:55,451 --> 00:30:58,270
of privilege. So they're quite
high up in terms of privilege.

543
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,460
But when it comes to absolute privileged,

544
00:31:00,461 --> 00:31:03,760
they're lower down than people who are
considered less privileged than them.

545
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:09,180
And this has helped me understand why
some poor white men are so angry in

546
00:31:09,281 --> 00:31:09,791
society.

547
00:31:09,791 --> 00:31:13,750
At the moment because they are considered
to be privileged but they don't feel

548
00:31:13,990 --> 00:31:16,840
any actual manifestations or
benefits of that privilege.

549
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:20,590
And I think that it's more productive
for us to understand this root of that

550
00:31:20,591 --> 00:31:23,560
anger rather than simply to
be angry with them in return.

551
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:31,810
Seeing these abstract structures I think
helps us pivot or can help us pivot

552
00:31:31,811 --> 00:31:35,710
between different situations that are
analogous in which we play different roles

553
00:31:35,711 --> 00:31:39,850
so that we can understand what it's like
to be in different situations in those

554
00:31:39,851 --> 00:31:44,260
abstracts structures and we can look at
analogous people in different structures.

555
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:48,010
So for example,
we've seen that in these three cubes,

556
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:53,040
30 42 and rich white men all occupied
and allow analogous position.

557
00:31:54,850 --> 00:31:58,450
And if we look at just one type of
power relationship over another one,

558
00:31:58,451 --> 00:32:02,620
we can see some more analogous things
such as that male people over female

559
00:32:02,621 --> 00:32:07,420
people are analogous in a way to white
people's relationships to black people,

560
00:32:07,570 --> 00:32:10,720
which is analogous to a rich
people's power over poor people.

561
00:32:10,870 --> 00:32:13,810
Because each of these involves
a power difference in society.

562
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:18,100
We can then have a discussion about how
exactly that power difference manifest

563
00:32:18,101 --> 00:32:22,390
itself. But there is an analogous power
difference in the sense of this diagram.

564
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:27,130
However, there is not an analogous power
difference between these two situations.

565
00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:32,250
So the interaction of male people to
female people is not analogous to the

566
00:32:32,591 --> 00:32:35,890
interaction of female people to mail
people because of that power difference.

567
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:41,100
And that is why that gives us a sense in
which men being sexist against women is

568
00:32:41,691 --> 00:32:45,650
not exactly the same as women
being sexist against men.

569
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:50,810
And it gives us a sense in which white
people being racist against black people

570
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:53,630
is different from black people
being racist against white people.

571
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:58,370
And a sense in which straight people
being prejudice against gay people is not

572
00:32:58,371 --> 00:33:01,670
the same as gay people in prejudice
against straight people because of power

573
00:33:01,671 --> 00:33:02,504
differences.

574
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:05,930
And I think that's an important thing
that these abstracts doctors can help us

575
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:06,793
remember

576
00:33:08,270 --> 00:33:13,270
together with the fact that something
could be not at the top in one context,

577
00:33:13,550 --> 00:33:18,080
but at the top in a different context.
So in our original diagram of privilege,

578
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:22,880
rich white men are at the top. But if
we restrict our attention to non men,

579
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:27,860
then we get these people and we find that
rich white, non men are now at the top.

580
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:32,930
And if in fact we restrict our entire
context to say women and we think of three

581
00:33:32,931 --> 00:33:36,680
types of privilege among women,
then we can think about rich,

582
00:33:36,710 --> 00:33:40,250
white and cisgender as being all
three types of privilege, for example.

583
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:45,520
And now we'll see that rich white cis
women occupied the analogous position that

584
00:33:46,221 --> 00:33:48,680
rich white men do in broader society.

585
00:33:49,310 --> 00:33:54,170
And this has helped me to understand
why there's so much anger against white

586
00:33:54,171 --> 00:33:57,860
women, especially in some parts of
the feminist movement at the moment,

587
00:33:58,070 --> 00:34:02,270
because they can be prone to seeing
themselves as underprivileged relative to

588
00:34:02,271 --> 00:34:07,271
white men because we women do all feel
everyday sexism every day and that is a

589
00:34:07,611 --> 00:34:10,100
very big part of our lives.
But then as a result,

590
00:34:10,130 --> 00:34:14,120
they can maybe forget how privileged
they are relative to nonwhite women who

591
00:34:14,121 --> 00:34:15,350
have it even worse than them.

592
00:34:15,770 --> 00:34:20,770
And understanding those underprivileged
and Oprah overprivileged aspects of the

593
00:34:22,221 --> 00:34:26,900
same person can help us to remember what
it's like to be somewhere else in the

594
00:34:26,901 --> 00:34:27,711
cube,
right?

595
00:34:27,711 --> 00:34:31,550
We're all over privileged relative to
someone and underprivileged relative to

596
00:34:31,551 --> 00:34:36,290
somebody else and so we could all pivot
between a situation in which we are one

597
00:34:36,291 --> 00:34:39,650
thing and a situation in which were other
to understand it from someone else's

598
00:34:39,651 --> 00:34:43,640
point of view and that way these abstract
structures can help us empathize with

599
00:34:43,641 --> 00:34:48,641
other people and here are some
pivots that I do or that we could do.

600
00:34:48,681 --> 00:34:53,681
So one is that as an Asian person I've
realized that I understand something of

601
00:34:53,811 --> 00:34:56,390
what it's like to be nonwhite
because I'm not white,

602
00:34:56,720 --> 00:35:01,720
but also I am probably among the most
privileged of non white people because

603
00:35:01,941 --> 00:35:06,941
Asians occupy in many ways a much better
position than other non white people in

604
00:35:07,071 --> 00:35:07,820
most of the world.

605
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:11,900
And so I can pivot between understanding
things from the underprivileged and the

606
00:35:11,901 --> 00:35:16,070
overprivileged point of view from a
racial perspective. In terms of wealth,

607
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:19,760
I can also pivot because I don't tend
to think of myself as extremely rich.

608
00:35:19,761 --> 00:35:23,480
I'm not so rich that I don't have to
work ever again. Not that kind of rich,

609
00:35:23,630 --> 00:35:27,710
but I'm doing perfectly fine. And that
is a much better situation to be in.

610
00:35:27,711 --> 00:35:30,380
Then people who are really struggling
who may be unemployed or working at

611
00:35:30,381 --> 00:35:34,220
minimum wage. And so I think most
people, especially in this country,

612
00:35:34,310 --> 00:35:36,230
we tend to view rich
people as other people.

613
00:35:36,770 --> 00:35:41,250
And however we're all richer than somebody
and there somebody who is viewing us

614
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:45,090
as rich and turn. And so we can
pivot between those situations.

615
00:35:45,330 --> 00:35:49,290
And here is the pivot that white women
could do because white women are less

616
00:35:49,291 --> 00:35:53,310
privileged than white men,
but more privileged than non white women.

617
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:57,720
And anytime you take a two
adjectives where one of them is,

618
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:00,120
has privileged and one of them
doesn't and put them together,

619
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:04,860
you can have this situation where if
you only see yourself as underprivileged

620
00:36:05,070 --> 00:36:07,380
and everyone else sees
you as overprivileged,

621
00:36:07,650 --> 00:36:09,750
then antagonism will result from that.

622
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:16,080
So finally I'd like to talk about sum
up what I think intelligence is really.

623
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:20,250
And because I've been drawing all
these diagrams of interconnectedness,

624
00:36:20,251 --> 00:36:23,490
I thought I draw one about intelligence
to show what I think are the

625
00:36:23,491 --> 00:36:25,410
contributing factors to intelligence.

626
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:29,610
So I do think that intelligence
involves being reasonable,

627
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:34,800
being not just logical, but powerfully
logical and also being helpful.

628
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:37,830
So if you just sit in
a cave and use logic,

629
00:36:38,010 --> 00:36:40,470
I don't think that's
particularly intelligent because
you're not really helping

630
00:36:40,471 --> 00:36:43,440
anything. I mean, people can disagree,
you can disagree with me about this,

631
00:36:43,441 --> 00:36:47,220
but I don't think that's very intelligent.
So what do these things mean?

632
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:51,510
I think that being reasonable
means you can be reasoned with.

633
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:54,330
And what that means is not
just that you use logic,

634
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:56,730
but you have some kind
of framework for it,

635
00:36:56,910 --> 00:36:59,610
a framework for telling when
you should change your mind.

636
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:02,580
I think that's really important. You
can tell when someone isn't reasonable,

637
00:37:02,581 --> 00:37:05,700
if there's no possible situation in
which they were, change their mind.

638
00:37:05,970 --> 00:37:09,690
If there is no possible evidence that
would convince them that the moon landings

639
00:37:09,691 --> 00:37:12,120
actually happened,
then that isn't terribly reasonable.

640
00:37:12,390 --> 00:37:16,650
So what about being
powerful? A logical, well,

641
00:37:16,651 --> 00:37:20,460
I gave an example of saying if you,
if you say something twice,

642
00:37:20,461 --> 00:37:23,790
so if you believe that if you don't
believe in gay marriage because you think

643
00:37:23,791 --> 00:37:25,260
marriage should be
between a man and a woman,

644
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:28,320
you've just said the same thing
twice. That's not powerful. Logical,

645
00:37:28,470 --> 00:37:29,850
even though it's not illogical.

646
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:35,060
So I think being powerfully
logical involves not just
using logic but also using

647
00:37:35,581 --> 00:37:40,500
techniques to build up logical arguments
and unravel logical arguments so that

648
00:37:40,501 --> 00:37:42,690
you can actually get
somewhere with your logic.

649
00:37:43,290 --> 00:37:46,110
And finally being helpful
crucially involves,

650
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,970
while some techniques were being helpful,

651
00:37:48,390 --> 00:37:52,620
but it really involves using our emotions
because people are emotional beings

652
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:55,680
and if we don't use emotions to
communicate with other people,

653
00:37:55,830 --> 00:37:59,040
then we'll just be throwing cold
logic at them all the time instead of

654
00:37:59,041 --> 00:38:03,030
understanding what it is that they are
feeling and why they are feeling it.

655
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:08,760
So I really like Carlos
typologies theory of stupidity.

656
00:38:09,150 --> 00:38:12,150
It's a slightly tongue in cheek,
but quite serious theory.

657
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:15,900
He starts by saying he thinks
that in any given group of people,

658
00:38:15,901 --> 00:38:18,210
there's the same proportion
of stupid people,

659
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:23,340
whether those are scientists,
people who work at Google politician,

660
00:38:23,341 --> 00:38:28,290
maybe more in politicians, um, professors,
Nobel prize winners, prisoners,

661
00:38:28,291 --> 00:38:32,870
criminals, street sweepers. He thinks that
there's a exactly the same proportion,

662
00:38:32,890 --> 00:38:37,890
stupid people everywhere and that it's
more your ever expecting even after

663
00:38:37,901 --> 00:38:42,580
you've taken that into account. So,
okay, what does he mean by stupid? Well,

664
00:38:42,581 --> 00:38:47,380
he has a definition and it involves a
graph with two axes and this axis is how

665
00:38:47,381 --> 00:38:51,550
much you benefit yourself. And this access
is how much you benefit other people.

666
00:38:52,150 --> 00:38:56,140
So if you benefit yourself
and hurt other people,

667
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:57,610
then you are abandoned.

668
00:38:58,540 --> 00:39:02,110
If you benefit other
people but hurt yourself,

669
00:39:02,290 --> 00:39:04,480
then you are what he calls.
Unfortunate.

670
00:39:04,570 --> 00:39:08,260
I sometimes think of this
as being a martyr where you
sacrifice yourself all the

671
00:39:08,261 --> 00:39:09,280
time for the good of others.

672
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:13,090
And I used to do this a lot and I think
that quite a lot of women do because we

673
00:39:13,091 --> 00:39:16,270
think that it's noble and we're supposed
to to efface ourselves for the good of

674
00:39:16,271 --> 00:39:17,104
other people.

675
00:39:18,130 --> 00:39:21,070
I've eventually realized that that's
not terribly productive in the long run.

676
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:26,530
If you hurt others and hurt yourself
at the same time, you are stupid.

677
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:29,170
And that's what how he defined stupid.

678
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:33,550
Whereas if you benefit other people and
you benefit yourself at the same time,

679
00:39:33,670 --> 00:39:36,970
that's intelligent.
And I think this is what intelligence is.

680
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:41,440
I don't think it has anything to do
with qualifications, degrees, education,

681
00:39:41,441 --> 00:39:46,210
money status, job achievements,
prizes, accolades, any of those things.

682
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:51,240
I think it's about this and I think
that we should use logic and emotions

683
00:39:51,641 --> 00:39:56,641
together so that we can benefit ourselves
and other people at the same time.

684
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:59,440
And in that way create a virtuous circle.

685
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:03,910
Because logic and abstract mathematical
thinking I think can actually help us to

686
00:40:03,911 --> 00:40:07,690
understand how other people think from
their point of view rather than from our

687
00:40:07,691 --> 00:40:10,960
point of view, which help us, helps
us to empathize with other people.

688
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:13,300
And if we can empathize with other people,

689
00:40:13,510 --> 00:40:17,980
then that will help us act in a logical
way for them and for us all together so

690
00:40:17,981 --> 00:40:20,920
that we can create this virtuous circle.

691
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:25,450
And I think it might be surprising idea
that abstract mathematics can do that

692
00:40:25,451 --> 00:40:28,390
for us.
But I truly believe that it can.

693
00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:32,980
And I hope that I can persuade many
people to join in with this lofty AME.

694
00:40:33,490 --> 00:40:34,323
Thank you.

695
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:39,580
[inaudible]

696
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,250
thank you very much. We do have
time for questions, please.

697
00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:52,890
Thanks for the talk. That
was really amazing. Um,

698
00:40:53,110 --> 00:40:58,110
I also have a background in mathematics
and have always wished that I could help

699
00:40:59,681 --> 00:41:02,320
other people and not be as afraid of it.

700
00:41:02,350 --> 00:41:07,350
And I see that you're writing books to
accomplish this and I had always planned

701
00:41:08,141 --> 00:41:12,040
to eventually create like a website where
I could offer free tutoring and then

702
00:41:12,041 --> 00:41:16,000
end up with this kind of database
of questions that are well answered.

703
00:41:16,330 --> 00:41:21,270
But now after seeing your chart, I
feel like that's the martyr route. Um,

704
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:27,120
so I'm just wondering if you have any
suggestions for what I could potentially

705
00:41:28,391 --> 00:41:31,270
do or if this is something you've
thought about at length, maybe.

706
00:41:31,710 --> 00:41:32,543
Um,
I,

707
00:41:32,550 --> 00:41:37,550
I did start out by just making videos
of me explaining things to people.

708
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:42,820
And it wasn't to mater diminish at
the time because I did also feel that,

709
00:41:43,941 --> 00:41:46,340
I mean there are many ways
that you can benefit yourself.

710
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:50,270
And one is that if you get a feeling of
self worth from having helped someone

711
00:41:50,271 --> 00:41:52,580
understand something,
then you have benefited yourself.

712
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:56,360
And personally I do derive my self
worth from how much I help other people.

713
00:41:56,510 --> 00:41:59,810
So maybe it gets a bit cyclical.
If I have helped other people,

714
00:41:59,811 --> 00:42:02,180
then I have helped myself.
But what I didn't,

715
00:42:02,210 --> 00:42:05,390
what I had to stop doing was
actively hurting myself. So I was,

716
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:08,180
I was quite unhappy in a job that I had,

717
00:42:08,181 --> 00:42:11,060
but I thought that they should carry
on going cause I was helping people.

718
00:42:11,061 --> 00:42:14,530
But even though I was completely miserable
and that was what was particularly on

719
00:42:14,531 --> 00:42:15,860
productive about it.

720
00:42:16,070 --> 00:42:20,210
So I think that the way in which you
benefit yourself can be measured in many

721
00:42:20,211 --> 00:42:23,900
ways.
And if you feel like it's benefiting you,

722
00:42:23,901 --> 00:42:25,490
then it's not necessarily martyrdom.

723
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:28,820
If it feels like it's hurting you and
that it's making your life miserable,

724
00:42:29,030 --> 00:42:32,390
then I think it limits your ability
to help people in the long run.

725
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:35,600
So you help people tons for a week
and then you're burnt out and you hate

726
00:42:35,601 --> 00:42:39,740
everybody and then you can't help anyone
anymore or you help people a bit less

727
00:42:39,770 --> 00:42:43,040
and you also look after yourself or do
things for yourself and then you have a

728
00:42:43,041 --> 00:42:46,460
much longer run of being
able to benefit other people.

729
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:51,240
So that's a some sort of
vague answer to that I think.

730
00:42:54,050 --> 00:42:56,630
Hi. Hi. Huh. Amazing Talk.

731
00:42:56,770 --> 00:43:01,340
And what a fantastic way to look at
the world. Um, one question though,

732
00:43:01,370 --> 00:43:03,960
uh, when you're starting
to break down, you know,

733
00:43:04,310 --> 00:43:06,860
challenges in life and
particularly looking at the,

734
00:43:07,010 --> 00:43:09,770
the weight loss slide as
one one that jumped out,

735
00:43:10,670 --> 00:43:15,670
I start to see a building series of
contributing factors to why this becomes a

736
00:43:15,710 --> 00:43:19,980
challenge to overcome. Um,
how'd you get over that too?

737
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:23,090
Do you find that when you start breaking
things out into all the different

738
00:43:23,450 --> 00:43:26,930
reasons why something is one way mentally,

739
00:43:26,931 --> 00:43:30,230
it becomes harder to then
make that change? How, how'd
you get to that next step?

740
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:33,290
Uh, what I do is, well first of all,

741
00:43:33,291 --> 00:43:36,080
I'm so used to dealing with
these huge diagrams that I have.

742
00:43:36,260 --> 00:43:38,900
I'm less daunted by them, Megan.
The more you deal with them,

743
00:43:38,901 --> 00:43:43,490
the less daunted you become and it
actually becomes clearer. It's very,

744
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:46,910
it's reassuring to me. Uh, and
that's not the same for everybody,

745
00:43:46,911 --> 00:43:49,700
but because I've been trained in
this way of thinking for a long time,

746
00:43:49,730 --> 00:43:51,380
it has become very reassuring to me.

747
00:43:51,890 --> 00:43:56,890
And I think that what I can then do is
look at all the individual parts and see

748
00:43:57,261 --> 00:44:01,100
which is the arrow. That would be the best
ones to try and break. And once you've,

749
00:44:01,490 --> 00:44:04,310
once you've actually made clear
what all the connections are,

750
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:07,790
I mean this is a bit like a cognitive
behavioral therapy technique where you try

751
00:44:07,791 --> 00:44:08,900
and see which area you can break,

752
00:44:09,110 --> 00:44:12,860
but it is about seeing which one is
the weakest or which one would be the

753
00:44:12,861 --> 00:44:15,320
easiest one to try and change.
And then you can try it.

754
00:44:15,321 --> 00:44:18,050
And if it doesn't work that well,
at least you might have weakened it a bit.

755
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:21,380
And then you can try weakening another
one and then eventually there'll be

756
00:44:21,381 --> 00:44:24,020
enough that has become weaker,
that the end result.

757
00:44:24,130 --> 00:44:25,640
It doesn't happen quite so strongly.

758
00:44:30,430 --> 00:44:34,080
Thank you for amazing talk. I
really enjoyed it. Okay. Um,

759
00:44:34,081 --> 00:44:36,660
I was wondering about,
um,

760
00:44:36,661 --> 00:44:41,661
so obviously we would all be better off
if we all use such logical mathematical

761
00:44:42,301 --> 00:44:44,880
constructs, but I think it's clear
that especially on the Internet,

762
00:44:44,881 --> 00:44:47,820
a lot of people do not.
Um, I was wondering,

763
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:52,880
are you optimistic or do you have any
tips for how we can engage people via

764
00:44:54,121 --> 00:44:54,751
logic?

765
00:44:54,751 --> 00:44:58,740
And if they're not even at all willing
to acknowledge that maybe that's the

766
00:44:58,741 --> 00:45:00,540
helpful thing to do.
I

767
00:45:00,850 --> 00:45:04,270
optimistic and that's why I'm here and
that's why I write books and that's why

768
00:45:04,271 --> 00:45:08,860
I'm in education because I am
optimistic that we can change things. I,

769
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:14,280
I think that there are some very extreme
people who we might not be able to

770
00:45:15,191 --> 00:45:19,300
reach immediately and that that's okay
and we shouldn't get too upset about

771
00:45:19,301 --> 00:45:23,140
those people. But there are a whole load
of other people who aren't so far gone.

772
00:45:23,420 --> 00:45:27,490
We shouldn't try. We shouldn't start with
the most absolutely difficult people,

773
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:31,570
but there are other people who are, first
of all, there are people who really,

774
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:33,910
really want to do better,
but don't know how.

775
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:36,970
And those are people we can
definitely help to do better.

776
00:45:37,150 --> 00:45:40,720
Then there are the people who are,
who aren't really terrible people.

777
00:45:40,870 --> 00:45:43,280
They just don't have the
techniques or don't realize,

778
00:45:43,281 --> 00:45:46,510
and that once you explain it to them,
just like with things like,

779
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:47,833
uh,

780
00:45:48,730 --> 00:45:51,550
sexually inappropriate comments,
some men,

781
00:45:51,850 --> 00:45:53,810
especially all the ones
have got just that.

782
00:45:53,811 --> 00:45:56,200
We've got used to the fact that they
can say those things and they don't

783
00:45:56,201 --> 00:45:58,150
understand,
but they're not really terrible people.

784
00:45:58,151 --> 00:46:01,380
And once you explain it to them,
then they get it and then they can change.

785
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:03,910
Whereas the ones who are
really absolutely morons,

786
00:46:03,940 --> 00:46:05,350
maybe we can't change them yet,

787
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:08,320
but eventually if we swear
enough people in that direction.

788
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:12,280
So I see it as being a kind of continuum
and that these are the people that we

789
00:46:12,281 --> 00:46:16,330
can most easily convinced. And then
once we've convinced these people,

790
00:46:16,331 --> 00:46:18,610
then everything will have
shifted a bit further this way.

791
00:46:18,611 --> 00:46:21,340
So that then we can convince these people
and then everything will shift this

792
00:46:21,341 --> 00:46:24,700
way and we can convince these people
and eventually everything will shift and

793
00:46:24,701 --> 00:46:28,480
then maybe we can get back to a situation
where it is not acceptable to be those

794
00:46:28,481 --> 00:46:29,314
people anymore.

795
00:46:29,470 --> 00:46:32,560
And one of the problems with the
current climate is that it has become

796
00:46:32,561 --> 00:46:35,050
acceptable again to be those people.

797
00:46:35,410 --> 00:46:38,410
And they probably were always there,

798
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:41,860
but maybe they felt like they weren't
supposed to show it or that there was not

799
00:46:41,861 --> 00:46:43,210
supposed to be really like that.

800
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:46,840
And if we can persuade everyone to come
a bit further a bit the back that way I

801
00:46:46,841 --> 00:46:49,240
don't think we have to just
flip everybody over overnight,

802
00:46:49,450 --> 00:46:51,850
but if we can shift the
balance a bit further,

803
00:46:52,150 --> 00:46:56,890
then I think that could just flip it
back again. And yes, I am optimistic.

804
00:46:57,140 --> 00:47:01,870
The the people who are unreasonable on
the Internet are often the loudest and

805
00:47:01,871 --> 00:47:02,704
the most annoying,

806
00:47:02,830 --> 00:47:06,760
but I don't think that they're the
majority of people and I've seen enough

807
00:47:06,761 --> 00:47:09,320
reasonable conversations on Twitter.
Even the,

808
00:47:09,370 --> 00:47:14,200
I believe it is possible if we all slow
down a bit and try to understand what

809
00:47:14,201 --> 00:47:16,930
other people are thinking rather than
immediately trying to show that they're

810
00:47:16,931 --> 00:47:17,764
wrong.

811
00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:27,420
You want an accomplished artist
as well and take off your book.

812
00:47:27,421 --> 00:47:30,040
Say it's about art.
So where the art play

813
00:47:30,310 --> 00:47:33,460
a role in making sense
of things. Oh, thank you.

814
00:47:33,850 --> 00:47:36,730
I I think that anything is an art.

815
00:47:36,731 --> 00:47:38,800
What's interesting because I
teach art students at the school,

816
00:47:38,801 --> 00:47:39,940
the art institute of Chicago,

817
00:47:39,941 --> 00:47:44,170
so we've had many discussions about
what art is and what science is and what

818
00:47:44,171 --> 00:47:48,520
we've collectively decided one semester
is that science is about trying to

819
00:47:48,521 --> 00:47:49,840
understand the world around us.

820
00:47:49,990 --> 00:47:52,750
And the art is about trying to
interpret the world around us.

821
00:47:52,990 --> 00:47:55,720
And that in order to understand the world,
you have to interpret it.

822
00:47:55,960 --> 00:47:58,030
And in order to interact with the
world you have to understand it.

823
00:47:58,120 --> 00:48:02,530
So they're really joined together. They're
not completely separate. And to me,

824
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:03,513
something,

825
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:08,880
something becomes an art if it's not an
algorithmic process that you just follow

826
00:48:08,981 --> 00:48:11,770
step by step. And that's why
there is an art to using logic.

827
00:48:11,771 --> 00:48:15,970
Because if you were just doing say,
computerated proofs of something,

828
00:48:15,971 --> 00:48:19,900
then maybe the computer wouldn't be
using an art because it would be using an

829
00:48:19,901 --> 00:48:23,680
algorithm. But, um,
when we're using logic,

830
00:48:23,681 --> 00:48:27,940
we have to understand the people around
us and we have to engage emotions and we

831
00:48:27,941 --> 00:48:29,950
have to pick ways of
speaking and we have to,

832
00:48:30,250 --> 00:48:33,430
we have to use techniques to
understand what's going on.

833
00:48:33,431 --> 00:48:35,410
And that to me is what makes it an art.

834
00:48:38,150 --> 00:48:42,840
Hi. I also enjoyed your talk pretty
much. Thank you. Ah, ah, you claimed, uh,

835
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:44,720
uh,
in any group of people,

836
00:48:44,721 --> 00:48:49,721
there is roughly the same ratio of
Carlos typologies claim neutral,

837
00:48:51,290 --> 00:48:52,940
neutral about whether I agreed with that.

838
00:48:52,941 --> 00:48:56,990
I agreed with his definition
of intelligence. Oh, okay.
Okay. Because it is somehow,

839
00:48:57,200 --> 00:49:02,200
you know how to understand that one
would feel that in a group of more

840
00:49:03,501 --> 00:49:05,960
intelligent people,
they were less martyrs.

841
00:49:06,270 --> 00:49:09,630
Well,
only if you define intelligence like this.

842
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:13,830
If you define intelligence by who
has really prestigious degrees from

843
00:49:13,831 --> 00:49:16,010
prestigious universities,
I don't know that that's,

844
00:49:16,470 --> 00:49:19,170
I've worked in some of those places
and I don't know that that's,

845
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:21,833
I don't know.

846
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:24,233
Thank you.

847
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:32,910
I was struck right at the beginning
when you started talking about the

848
00:49:32,911 --> 00:49:37,440
abstraction of too by the fact that that's
maybe straightforward in English and

849
00:49:37,441 --> 00:49:39,870
there are several
languages where there are

850
00:49:40,580 --> 00:49:40,910
okay

851
00:49:40,910 --> 00:49:44,510
particles you put after the number
to talk about what kind of it is,

852
00:49:44,660 --> 00:49:47,510
so they've got like more levels of
abstraction built into the language.

853
00:49:48,010 --> 00:49:50,820
Does that change?

854
00:49:50,821 --> 00:49:53,880
I didn't anything in practice or anything
in the application in the process

855
00:49:53,881 --> 00:49:54,714
you're thinking about?

856
00:49:55,140 --> 00:49:58,230
I guess the child development
aspects is way outside the scope,

857
00:49:58,610 --> 00:50:03,120
but I think that it means like you say
that there are some more intermediate

858
00:50:03,121 --> 00:50:07,500
levels, but I think at the level of
two that's still the concept of two.

859
00:50:07,650 --> 00:50:11,940
Then there's some, some other
refinements of to blur and too blue.

860
00:50:11,941 --> 00:50:13,440
And I know you mean,
cause they,

861
00:50:13,570 --> 00:50:17,070
that there was this in Cantonese and it's
terribly confusing when you're trying

862
00:50:17,071 --> 00:50:21,840
to speak it and it's not your first
language, but I think at the level of two,

863
00:50:21,841 --> 00:50:24,810
there is still a concept of too that sits,
sits,

864
00:50:25,300 --> 00:50:28,910
it's kind of above all of those.
And so yes,

865
00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:31,730
at different levels of abstraction,
abstraction,

866
00:50:31,731 --> 00:50:35,780
you get different subtle
nuances in between things. And,

867
00:50:36,170 --> 00:50:37,003
uh,

868
00:50:37,940 --> 00:50:42,800
I don't know what that means for we native
English speakers and whether we have

869
00:50:42,801 --> 00:50:45,340
a less subtle distinction between
different types of objects.

870
00:50:45,430 --> 00:50:47,470
But thank you very much again.

871
00:50:48,490 --> 00:50:53,490
[inaudible].
