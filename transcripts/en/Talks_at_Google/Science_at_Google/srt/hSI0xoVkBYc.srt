1
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:06,750
Thanks a lot.

2
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:09,960
I got to talk for just a couple of
minutes and Alan will talk for a couple of

3
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:14,070
minutes and then we will entertain your
questions and, and a have discussion.

4
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:18,450
Uh, it's a thrill for us to, to be here

5
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:22,470
talking to you guys about, um, this, uh,

6
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:25,950
this book chasing New Horizons and the,
uh,

7
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:28,630
the mission and the effort
that led up to the mission, uh,

8
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:33,180
that finally after a long journey,

9
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:37,440
much of which was spent
on earth. Um, we, uh,

10
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:39,640
finally made it to Pluto.
Um,

11
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:44,550
and of course Google is a part of
this story in, in various ways.

12
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:49,500
In fact, um, one of the really
cool things that happened after,

13
00:00:49,501 --> 00:00:53,420
uh, the, uh, finally, uh, the, the, uh,

14
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:56,970
success of the, um, of the
mission with achieved and,

15
00:00:56,971 --> 00:01:00,420
and our new horizons made
it to Pluto was that, um,

16
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:05,100
that there was a Google doodle, um, about
the new horizons mission are really,

17
00:01:05,101 --> 00:01:07,830
really cool. One of the next
day was one of that, you know,

18
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:10,290
part of the global outpouring of,
uh,

19
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:14,040
of interest that reflected back on the
team that had, that had achieved this.

20
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:18,830
And of course the, um, the
conductivity of the world that,

21
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:22,890
that your company has been been so much
a part of is also an interesting part of

22
00:01:22,891 --> 00:01:27,570
the story because unlike other
first planetary flybys historically,

23
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:31,230
um, that happened in the,
in the late 20th century,

24
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:36,630
the flyby of Pluto happened in an age
where it could instantly be shared and

25
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:41,070
collectively experienced around the world.

26
00:01:41,071 --> 00:01:44,970
And it really made the
experience different for those
of us who happened to be

27
00:01:44,971 --> 00:01:49,170
there at the applied physics
laboratory in Laurel, Maryland,

28
00:01:49,171 --> 00:01:53,940
where the team was, um,
controlling the spacecraft in
getting the data down. First.

29
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:57,450
It made the experience different there
because there was this reaching out to

30
00:01:57,451 --> 00:01:59,730
the world and feedback coming back.

31
00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:02,820
And of course it made the
experience different for,
for people around the world.

32
00:02:02,821 --> 00:02:06,570
It was truly the first
21st century, um, uh,

33
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,210
experience of exploration
that was like that. So,

34
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:13,740
so this book chasing New Horizons, um, is,

35
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:18,630
uh, the story of, um, how
Pluto was explored in a lot of,

36
00:02:18,631 --> 00:02:22,240
it's really the backstory, the, they, um,

37
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:27,240
the aspects of planetary exploration and
have this adventure that's very human

38
00:02:27,241 --> 00:02:31,620
adventure that most people don't know.
Everybody knows we made it to Pluto. And,

39
00:02:31,621 --> 00:02:34,870
and like you said, you know,
in a way it's like, you know,

40
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:39,420
spoiler over on the cover of the book,
there's a beautiful picture of Pluto.

41
00:02:39,421 --> 00:02:43,710
So a lot of this is the drama
of will they make it w you know,

42
00:02:43,711 --> 00:02:47,040
against all odds. And then of course, you
know how the story ends, but it's like,

43
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:51,630
you know, a lot of good historical
movies and novels and stories,

44
00:02:51,631 --> 00:02:54,300
even though you know how it came out,
uh,

45
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:58,890
you can still be on the edge of your seat
with the drama and all the close calls.

46
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:02,960
And that's the kind of
story we tell here. Um, I,

47
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:04,990
I've been in love with
the story for a long time.

48
00:03:04,991 --> 00:03:09,940
Way before there was a new horizons
mission. There was a small group,

49
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:11,520
Alan and uh,

50
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:15,430
some of his colleagues who were quite
young when they started just out of Grad

51
00:03:15,431 --> 00:03:20,290
school and their 20s and 30s, who got
this idea that after voyager made it to,

52
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:21,550
to Neptune,

53
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:26,350
which was the last of the sort of previous
era of planetary exploration after

54
00:03:26,351 --> 00:03:29,020
that in 1989, you know, what was next?

55
00:03:29,021 --> 00:03:34,021
We had had our first vibe eyes of all
the classically known planets except for

56
00:03:34,151 --> 00:03:38,620
Pluto. And these guys said, let's keep
going. And at first, uh, you know,

57
00:03:38,621 --> 00:03:42,640
they had a lot of doors slammed in
their faces and a lot of doubters and

58
00:03:42,641 --> 00:03:46,600
naysayers. And then as they
started going, there were a lot of,

59
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:51,560
I'm sort of near calamities and a lot
of um, seeming dead ends. But, uh,

60
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:56,050
it's really a story of
overcoming obstacles and a
team that just got fixated on

61
00:03:56,051 --> 00:04:01,051
an idea and didn't give up and eventually
gathered more and more people to

62
00:04:01,151 --> 00:04:05,590
realize it was a good idea, rallied
the scientific community behind it.

63
00:04:05,591 --> 00:04:10,591
And there's a whole story there of how
the skepticism gave way to widespread

64
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,220
endorsement.

65
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:15,880
And then there are a lot of political
intrigues and it was canceled by two

66
00:04:15,881 --> 00:04:20,470
successive political administrations 26
years from when Alan started working on

67
00:04:20,471 --> 00:04:22,830
this to, uh, you know, started,

68
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:27,840
got the idea and started rallying people
together to the actual flyby of Pluto.

69
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:28,991
Um, so, you know,

70
00:04:28,991 --> 00:04:32,170
you hear like it took nine years to
cross a solver system and that is an

71
00:04:32,171 --> 00:04:34,150
impressive time and it's longer than,
you know,

72
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:39,190
most of our missions and did require
a lot of technical innovation to, uh,

73
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:42,250
succeed at that. And yet
that's like, you know,

74
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:46,420
only a small part of the long
struggle to make this happen. So,

75
00:04:46,421 --> 00:04:50,200
so I was excited to tell that story
and excited to work with Allen, um,

76
00:04:50,201 --> 00:04:52,060
who you know,
who lived it and,

77
00:04:52,061 --> 00:04:57,061
and work together to combine our voices
and really try to narrate what is

78
00:04:57,161 --> 00:05:00,130
essentially an adventure
story, sort of a Techie, nerdy,

79
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:03,770
very human adventure story. Um, and um,

80
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:07,780
it's not just Allen want to make
sure and point out, uh, you know,

81
00:05:07,781 --> 00:05:09,580
he was obviously the
leader of the mission,

82
00:05:09,581 --> 00:05:14,080
but there were a lot of people involved.
As Alan says, it's a team sport. And um,

83
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:18,840
so we included the voices of
a lot of other people. Um, uh,

84
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:22,720
members of the science
team, engineers, um,

85
00:05:22,721 --> 00:05:26,350
some NASA officials at different people
that were involved in this history and

86
00:05:26,351 --> 00:05:30,940
in this mission. So in the
book, in addition to our
narrative, you'll see a lot of,

87
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:35,680
um, a lot of Alan's voice in the
first person sort of set aside, um,

88
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:37,000
relating his experience,

89
00:05:37,001 --> 00:05:40,510
but also a lot of other voices kind of
we weaving in and you'll get to know some

90
00:05:40,511 --> 00:05:45,200
of the characters. So, um,
anyways, I've, I've loved this
story for a long time when,

91
00:05:45,201 --> 00:05:50,201
when I got the opportunity to actually
work with Alan on this a book,

92
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:53,500
it was a dream come true for me because I,

93
00:05:53,501 --> 00:05:56,500
I lived to tell stories of planetary
exploration and in my view,

94
00:05:56,501 --> 00:06:01,100
there's no better story in our time of
exploration. Uh, and then of course,

95
00:06:01,101 --> 00:06:04,900
Pluto itself turned out
to be just tremendous, uh,

96
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:10,040
scientifically. Aesthetically
it's beautiful. It's mysterious.

97
00:06:10,041 --> 00:06:13,370
It's so much more active and
dynamic than anybody expected.

98
00:06:13,371 --> 00:06:17,270
And that has taught us a lot that we
didn't know about planetary science.

99
00:06:17,271 --> 00:06:19,600
And that feeds back on
just our awareness of,

100
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:22,760
of what kinds of planets there
can be in the universe in general.

101
00:06:22,761 --> 00:06:27,140
So it was a huge payoff.
And, um, the, uh, you know,

102
00:06:27,141 --> 00:06:32,141
the only person who knows what needed
to be known to tell the story really in

103
00:06:34,671 --> 00:06:36,200
full is Alan Stern.

104
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:41,380
And it was a privilege for me to get to
work with Allen to combine our voices to

105
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:44,800
tell the story. And with that, I want to
introduce Alan to come up and, and, uh,

106
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:46,010
say a few words.
It's your

107
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:51,300
[inaudible]

108
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:55,410
that's great to be here.
Um, thank you David. Um,

109
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:58,580
I dunno how many of you know this?

110
00:06:58,581 --> 00:07:02,000
David is the best writer in our
field as a planetary scientist.

111
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:07,030
No one has written a better books from
Venus revealed about the radar missions

112
00:07:07,401 --> 00:07:11,660
that uncovered the geology of
Venus to Earth in human hands.

113
00:07:11,661 --> 00:07:15,500
His most recent work before,
before chasing and, uh,

114
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:18,980
and quite a number of others.
And it's been a privilege for me.

115
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:23,240
We've known each other a long time in a
lot of different modes over the years.

116
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:25,760
Uh, since we met, he lived
in boulder for a long time.

117
00:07:25,761 --> 00:07:30,230
And then in Denver where I'm based, the
used to be my boss too. There's that too.

118
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:34,320
That's true. Um, so, um,

119
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:38,630
this is a really interesting story.

120
00:07:38,631 --> 00:07:42,380
I hope you get a chance to read it and
I hope people watching on video get a

121
00:07:42,381 --> 00:07:44,260
chance to read it.
Um,

122
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:51,280
when I was a boy, I was swept off my
feet by the early planetary explorations.

123
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:55,670
All I ever wanted to do was grow
up and get through. You know,

124
00:07:55,671 --> 00:08:00,530
I'm 11 years old and just the idea of
going to college is like the light year in

125
00:08:00,531 --> 00:08:03,440
the future and wanted to go to
college and then I found out, oh,

126
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:04,520
you have to go to graduate school.

127
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:10,190
Then I went to graduate school
for different times. Um, but um,

128
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:15,200
at the time I emerged in 1989 with my phd.
Um,

129
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:20,570
voyager was finishing and all the
planets from mercury to Neptune had been

130
00:08:20,571 --> 00:08:23,840
explored at least first reconnaissance.

131
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:25,910
Pluto was kind of unfinished,

132
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:29,870
unfinished business and
scientifically fascinating.

133
00:08:29,871 --> 00:08:33,710
We knew that it had an atmosphere and
a giant satellite that made it a double

134
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:35,750
planet.
We'd never been to anything like that.

135
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:39,080
We knew that it's surface
composition was really exotic.

136
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:43,610
We knew a number of really enticing,
very basic facts,

137
00:08:43,611 --> 00:08:47,300
but I think you could put them
all on a three by five card. Um,

138
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:52,700
but to be a planetary scientist at
the beginning of the age of space

139
00:08:52,701 --> 00:08:57,660
exploration,
the most prized mission is to be on,

140
00:08:57,690 --> 00:08:59,310
we're always the first missions.

141
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:04,660
Only the best got to be on the first
missions to Mars or Venus or Jupiter or

142
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:09,180
mercury or on down the line. And those
are the missions were scientifically,

143
00:09:09,181 --> 00:09:13,790
you can say the result is like
taking candy from a baby, right?

144
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:19,200
Everything. Every image is, is
just big news. Every spectrum,

145
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:21,570
every data type.
And

146
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:28,050
for me and for my generation, Pluto is the
last train to Clarksville. That's like,

147
00:09:28,051 --> 00:09:29,160
that's the only one.

148
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:34,260
When do we get a chance to be on something
that momentous and voyager was just

149
00:09:34,261 --> 00:09:38,820
finishing and we thought, well of
NASA is in the exploration business.

150
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:42,390
This will be a cinch.
This will be a 15 minute conversation.

151
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:46,500
Who wouldn't want to make the first
mission to the last planet? Right?

152
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:52,280
And 14 years later we finally achieve
funding after crazy experiences,

153
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:56,250
which you'll read about you.
This book is really, you know,

154
00:09:56,251 --> 00:10:01,251
if you picture like DNA double helix
picture like heck to helix or something,

155
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:06,240
because the book is the political
story of how this all came to be.

156
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:11,870
And it's the scientific story of why
it was important to do and how it was

157
00:10:12,691 --> 00:10:16,260
transformed by the discovery of the Kuiper
belt into being the first mission to

158
00:10:16,261 --> 00:10:19,200
the third zone of the solar system
and then these fantastic results.

159
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:22,470
But it's also an under the hood.
Look at how you build.

160
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,140
What we had to do was we had a big,

161
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:30,230
basically rebuild voyager much lighter
and much faster and you'll appreciate

162
00:10:30,331 --> 00:10:34,980
this. I think that some of the projects
you do, we had to do it in half the time.

163
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:39,120
And one fifth the cost.
So we had to make a lot of innovations,

164
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:43,620
took 2,500 men and women. I realize that
Google, that's a hobby shop project,

165
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:48,960
but a lot of people worked on this
and they worked very hard, um,

166
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:53,310
under the gun with what some
folks thought were impossible.

167
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:57,450
Boundary conditions.
I know when we want it,

168
00:10:57,451 --> 00:11:01,710
we want it against the Goliath
of planetary exploration.

169
00:11:01,711 --> 00:11:03,300
Our team wanted against JPL,

170
00:11:03,301 --> 00:11:06,500
the jet propulsion lab at Caltech
who had been first to every plant,

171
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:10,920
the solar system. We wrote the better
proposal. We marketed it better.

172
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:12,480
We did have the better team.

173
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:16,970
And Nasa I think made the right
choice because I do think, um,

174
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:19,320
it's uncertain to me whether they,

175
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:22,410
the guys could have pulled it
off given all the constraints.

176
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:26,040
They were really old school
and we were new school,

177
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:31,110
but they were talented group and I had
many friends on those competing teams.

178
00:11:31,111 --> 00:11:35,030
And nonetheless, we got it.
And when we want it, um,

179
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,730
and I can't tell you how many phone
calls I got from friends that were

180
00:11:38,731 --> 00:11:41,730
colleagues and said, you won, but you
lost. And that story's in the book.

181
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:45,960
David wrote the book because they'd
say, you know, great, you've won.

182
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:48,900
You're now in charge of the mission
to Pluto that we'll never get launched

183
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:52,590
because you will either, you'll fail
on schedule, it won't be your fault.

184
00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:56,290
It will be some vendor somewhere, you
know, some critical part you need.

185
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:59,650
Or you won't get nuclear launch approval
because no one's done it ever in four

186
00:11:59,651 --> 00:12:03,820
years or even close, you know, that's
42 state and federal agencies, you know,

187
00:12:03,821 --> 00:12:08,110
if you, you guys use the phrase we
use about her hurting cats. Yeah,

188
00:12:08,111 --> 00:12:11,850
this is different. This is cats hurting
themselves. It's a whole nother lives,

189
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:16,200
like three dimensional chess. So, uh,
uh, and then people would say, well,

190
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:21,220
what do you mean a 20% of the
two dimes on the dollar in?

191
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:25,540
You're never going to figure that out and
get it done in one of these traps will

192
00:12:25,541 --> 00:12:27,520
bite you.
You might get through some of these hoops,

193
00:12:27,521 --> 00:12:31,120
but you'll never get through all of them.
And fortunately,

194
00:12:31,121 --> 00:12:35,530
our team was very dedicated,
dedicated to nights and weekends. Uh,

195
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:37,350
uh,
the,

196
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:41,830
the primary players were southwest
research institute where I work,

197
00:12:41,831 --> 00:12:45,480
the applied physics lab,
Apl at Johns Hopkins, uh,

198
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,680
and Lockheed Martin
for the launch vehicle,

199
00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:52,630
the Department of energy for the
nuclear power supply. Um, by the way,

200
00:12:52,631 --> 00:12:57,460
because Google is a restaurant,
we used to call APL

201
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:03,940
always a pizza lunch cause the only
thing they would ever serve pizza

202
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:09,610
like I, the number of pizzas I
ate or in scientific notation.

203
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:15,700
Anyway, this, this book tells
all those stories and it's,

204
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:19,810
the stories are woven together.
The science, the politics,
the how you build this,

205
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:23,050
how you fly an interplanetary
mission across the solar system.

206
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:26,350
Some of the technologies we invented
like spacecraft, hibernation,

207
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:29,690
the navigation requirements
that were super stringent, um,

208
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:34,720
hit a 40 by 60 kilometer window from 3
billion miles away. And Oh, by the way,

209
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:36,810
and do that while arriving
within nine months,

210
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:41,080
minutes of the time you aim for when you
launched nine years before and do all

211
00:13:41,081 --> 00:13:44,860
that. Um, and you only get one
shot. There's no voyager two here.

212
00:13:44,861 --> 00:13:47,880
There's no new horizons to, to back
it up. There's no making a uturn.

213
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:52,660
We're going 14 kilometers a second,
get it right or go home. Um,

214
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:56,140
and it all worked out.
Although we had a near death experience,

215
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:59,320
which the book begins with July 4th,

216
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:01,810
2015 a day meant for
other kinds of fireworks.

217
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:05,590
And my cell phone rings and I
pick it up for even picking it up.

218
00:14:05,591 --> 00:14:07,000
I saw it was the guy,

219
00:14:07,001 --> 00:14:10,960
it's our project manager and he's not
calling me on the 4th of July because he's

220
00:14:10,961 --> 00:14:15,760
having a great barbecue before he ever
got the sentence through his mouth.

221
00:14:15,761 --> 00:14:18,580
You know, I could tell from the
gravity of his voice, he said, Alan,

222
00:14:18,581 --> 00:14:22,000
we've lost contact with the spacecraft.
That just doesn't happen.

223
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:26,890
It's not like when your computer reboots,
right. It'll be fine in five minutes.

224
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:29,850
Um, so, um, it,

225
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:33,070
it's a really interesting read and I don't
think there's any book that's like it.

226
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:34,653
Um,

227
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:39,820
we were on the John Bachelor show in
Manhattan this weekend and he kept saying,

228
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:45,340
you wrote a movie and we hope we wrote a
movie because it's a really interesting

229
00:14:45,341 --> 00:14:48,550
story and it's not just for tech heads,

230
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:52,480
but it's also a story of
drama and persistence. Uh,

231
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:57,700
by people with a dream that actually
managed despite a lot of issues along the

232
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:02,390
way to pull off what they didn't
know how to do when we started.

233
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:06,560
And I'd be happy to answer
questions if you have some, uh, and,

234
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:11,320
and talk about this, but I want to
tell one story before I stopped. Um,

235
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:17,640
I've never told this story
before. Um, but, um, uh,

236
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:21,230
I worked at NASA for a time and when
I left, this is NASA headquarters.

237
00:15:21,231 --> 00:15:25,220
I ran the science program and,
uh, and that's a big enterprise.

238
00:15:25,221 --> 00:15:28,250
It's about five and a half billion
dollars a year and not big by Google

239
00:15:28,251 --> 00:15:28,671
standards,

240
00:15:28,671 --> 00:15:33,671
but I hadn't left about 10 days and Eric
Schmidt invited me to come out to Palo

241
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:38,510
Alto for, offer me a job and I said no,

242
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:43,520
which may have made the difference between
whether we explored the Pluto system

243
00:15:43,521 --> 00:15:48,490
or not. I mean, in the end.
Thank you, Eric watching. Um,

244
00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:52,100
that was a really enticing
job. Um, but you know,

245
00:15:52,101 --> 00:15:56,960
I'll be back on the market
after we finished exploring
the corporate belt anyway,

246
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:59,510
so I thought I'd just tell
that little anecdote. Um,

247
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:02,390
and then Dave wants to
come back up here and, uh,

248
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,210
I don't know if I was just
books been out less than a week,

249
00:16:05,211 --> 00:16:07,100
so probably no one in
the room has read it.

250
00:16:07,101 --> 00:16:10,220
But if you have any questions
about planetary exploration,

251
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:14,540
certainly astrobiology uh, or uh, Pluto,

252
00:16:14,541 --> 00:16:17,540
the Kuiper belt or new
horizons have at it.

253
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:19,110
You know,
I just have to say,

254
00:16:19,111 --> 00:16:22,070
one of the great things about working
with Alan on this book is that, uh,

255
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:25,560
he got a lot of great stories and we,
uh,

256
00:16:25,770 --> 00:16:28,830
the first step of us writing this book
together was we talked to every Saturday

257
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:30,510
really for a year and a half.

258
00:16:31,050 --> 00:16:34,440
And he just told me stories and I asked
him questions and we figured out the

259
00:16:34,441 --> 00:16:38,520
structure of the book and uh, um,
but I never heard that story before.

260
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:43,110
That's a new, there are a lot
of stories. Yeah. Anyways,

261
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:46,440
we can put in a thousand page book and
know, do you guys want to know? Yeah,

262
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:50,690
so obviously there was a ton of
build up to actually launching,

263
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:53,490
but once it actually launched,
what was that?

264
00:16:53,491 --> 00:16:57,040
Nearly a decade waiting like every day.

265
00:16:57,050 --> 00:17:01,380
You have to check in and make adjustments
or is it manages itself and you just

266
00:17:01,381 --> 00:17:02,340
stress for nine years.

267
00:17:05,570 --> 00:17:06,460
Explain what that's like.

268
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:11,210
Um, the most succinct answer would
be yes to all those things. Um,

269
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:14,700
it was intimidating to think about nine
and a half years when we first launched

270
00:17:14,701 --> 00:17:17,790
it.
That just seemed to me like forever.

271
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,650
I mean on my 12 year is going to be 21,
I can't even picture Jordan 21.

272
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:28,060
Uh, that kind of thing. And I
think all of us felt that way. Um,

273
00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:34,160
one thing people don't know and the
book does describe it is that, um,

274
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:37,130
while people think that, you know, Oh,

275
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:40,170
a lot of people know the spacecraft
was hibernating so they think we were

276
00:17:40,171 --> 00:17:44,490
hibernating. We had nothing to do.
But let me put this in context.

277
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:46,500
When voyager flew across the solar system,

278
00:17:47,010 --> 00:17:52,010
they had a staff of 450 people run the
spacecraft to do the science team or the

279
00:17:52,171 --> 00:17:53,520
management to do everything.

280
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:57,240
My team was large when
we were building it,

281
00:17:57,810 --> 00:18:02,070
but within a month of launching it,
we let everybody go.

282
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:03,540
We didn't need a launch
vehicle team anymore.

283
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:05,400
We didn't need the
department of energy anymore.

284
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:07,710
We don't need a big engineering
kid is nothing off to build.

285
00:18:07,711 --> 00:18:11,670
We just put a lot of spares and controlled
inventory and we had already done all

286
00:18:11,671 --> 00:18:14,790
the documentation and we just
kept some engineering leads.

287
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:16,980
And so we were 50 people.

288
00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:21,420
That's like the number of people in
this room to do every part of it.

289
00:18:21,421 --> 00:18:24,600
From the flight controllers to the
engineers, to the science team,

290
00:18:24,601 --> 00:18:27,570
to the management team, to
the public affairs, all that.

291
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:32,550
And uh, we were incredibly
busy. There's a chapter,

292
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:36,120
it's one of my couple of favorites in
the whole book called Battle Plan Pluto

293
00:18:36,930 --> 00:18:39,300
where we tell the story
of how you actually plan.

294
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:43,230
I'm a fly by like this where the
spacecraft is operating completely burned,

295
00:18:43,231 --> 00:18:43,831
no control,

296
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:48,831
all the software and all the support files
have to be completely tested in every

297
00:18:50,581 --> 00:18:51,600
way you can think of.

298
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:56,400
And how we had to plan for fly bys
because we were worried we would find

299
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,820
hazards, debris that can strike
the spacecraft on approach.

300
00:18:59,821 --> 00:19:03,060
So we picked different aim points
and we could choose among them,

301
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:07,020
but the point at which you would choose
was so close to the moment of fly by

302
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:09,450
that you had to have the software
on the shelf. There was no,

303
00:19:09,810 --> 00:19:11,400
oh now we'll write a different plan.

304
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:13,830
Each plan takes like a
year to develop and test,

305
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:17,820
so we had to do this four
times and on top of it we had,

306
00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:22,800
we put intelligent software up on the
bird that could detect 160 something

307
00:19:22,801 --> 00:19:26,010
faults.
The fuel was leaking at the computers,

308
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:29,580
getting bad messages for this
or that. We lost comm, whatever,

309
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:31,800
and then we'd run down a checklist.

310
00:19:31,890 --> 00:19:35,760
It could even as it ran down the checklist
decision in branch based upon data.

311
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:38,820
So it would act as if you
had a crew member on board.

312
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:40,950
We had to write and test all that stuff.

313
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:44,580
We conducted mission simulations in
which we fake the clocks out on the,

314
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:48,390
on the bird in flight in the middle
of nowhere between Uranus and Neptune.

315
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:51,780
It thinks it's 2015 it's doing
nine days of every pointing.

316
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:55,110
We ship all that data back and makes
sure every star field is exactly the one

317
00:19:55,111 --> 00:19:59,190
you intended, right? Um, every instrument
was operating at the right voltage,

318
00:19:59,191 --> 00:20:03,390
every little thing. Um, we had 40 mission
simulations, the bottom line, all this,

319
00:20:03,391 --> 00:20:06,770
and I'm only telling you
part of the story is, um,

320
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:10,350
we worked our butts off for
nine years. Um, Alice Bowman,

321
00:20:10,351 --> 00:20:15,180
who's the woman who runs up my
mission control, um, you know,

322
00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:17,550
many times came to me and said,
this is too much work for this team.

323
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:22,730
We have to take content out. We've
got a separate icing from cake. And,

324
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:26,550
and she called it a nine and
a half year sprint. Right?

325
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:31,020
It was tough and the spacecraft was
hibernating a lot, but this little team,

326
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:33,540
um,
it was,

327
00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:37,290
it was incessant and all of a sudden
Pluto was there and a lot of people were

328
00:20:37,291 --> 00:20:40,860
coming and saying, wait a minute,
can we put the brakes on? You know,

329
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:44,850
I actually don't want, want to save her
this. It's coming too fast. So thanks.

330
00:20:44,851 --> 00:20:48,070
That's a great question. By the
way. They, the hibernation, um,

331
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:52,120
that Allen mentioned was itself a really,
uh,

332
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:54,100
innovative part of this mission.

333
00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:59,490
That was a brilliant solution to how do
you have a spacecraft traveling for nine

334
00:20:59,801 --> 00:21:01,750
and a half years and not be
worn out when you get there.

335
00:21:01,751 --> 00:21:05,110
And also have the human resources to do
all that planning and simulating that

336
00:21:05,111 --> 00:21:07,030
Allen was talking about
with a really small team.

337
00:21:07,031 --> 00:21:10,120
It was part of how they
answered this question,

338
00:21:10,121 --> 00:21:13,000
how do we do something on a tiny
fraction of voyagers budget?

339
00:21:13,001 --> 00:21:15,970
And that allowed them to have a smaller
ground him cause they weren't running

340
00:21:15,971 --> 00:21:17,560
the spacecraft the whole time,
but it was,

341
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:19,120
it was something they had
to learn how to do that.

342
00:21:19,121 --> 00:21:20,140
And we talk about that in the book.

343
00:21:20,141 --> 00:21:22,930
They practice hibernation at first
they put it to sleep for, you know,

344
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:26,620
a couple of days and then a week and
then a month to make sure that it works.

345
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:27,960
And that innovation and,

346
00:21:27,961 --> 00:21:31,750
and a lot of the other ones they came up
with are now part of space exploration

347
00:21:31,751 --> 00:21:33,130
and other missions are using them.

348
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:37,320
Uh, just say one thing and then
I'll call on this gentleman,

349
00:21:37,321 --> 00:21:39,140
but you got to ask me before the,

350
00:21:39,490 --> 00:21:43,080
you all came in the room about how long
it took to get the data to the ground.

351
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:47,370
You know, the dirty little secret is
we did that to save money is we have,

352
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:51,180
we intentionally chose that. If you
could take nine years to reach Pluto,

353
00:21:51,450 --> 00:21:53,550
you could spend one more year
to get all the data back.

354
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:59,630
Voyager was seventies
technology at Neptune almost
as far as Pluto head anytime

355
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,210
right there behind you, a little two
meter addition, Tenet, small. We,

356
00:22:04,050 --> 00:22:09,050
we had one 10th the data rate of voyager
intentionally because we realize what

357
00:22:09,541 --> 00:22:11,970
an enormous cost savings
it was. You say, well,

358
00:22:11,971 --> 00:22:15,330
how much cheaper can a smaller antenna
beat? It's not the antenna. He said, well,

359
00:22:15,331 --> 00:22:18,630
how much cheaper can you know?
Lower powered transmitter speed.

360
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:19,800
They save you millions,

361
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:23,130
but millions is small in an 800 and
something million dollar project.

362
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:27,000
What it really was, was that if
we had lower power transmitters,

363
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:32,720
I could graduate down from to like voyager
to one nuclear power supply and those

364
00:22:34,231 --> 00:22:37,650
babies cost 80 million a piece.
So by,

365
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:39,570
by accepting lower data rates,

366
00:22:39,571 --> 00:22:44,400
we made this very intelligent compromise
that we would take a whole year and a

367
00:22:44,401 --> 00:22:47,790
little more to get the data back
in exchange for the, you know,

368
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:49,920
that's almost a hundred
million dollars right there.

369
00:22:50,450 --> 00:22:53,850
So there were a bunch of those and we talk
about them. Sorry for the detour. Yes.

370
00:22:54,530 --> 00:22:55,910
Um,
in your opinion,

371
00:22:56,530 --> 00:23:01,530
what was the scientific knowledge
we gained about Pluto or

372
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:05,960
of having these kind of,

373
00:23:07,130 --> 00:23:08,420
Oh God,
which 1:00 AM I right

374
00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:09,283
children

375
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:16,670
because thought is okay, so we got,
doesn't have what doesn't have a core,

376
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:21,750
that's all interesting piece of
information but not as shocking,

377
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,700
but you know what, fuck
this. Appreciate it.

378
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:31,510
Yeah. Um, I don't think there's an
answer to that actually. You know,

379
00:23:31,511 --> 00:23:34,180
different people would say different
things. And there's a third thing too,

380
00:23:34,181 --> 00:23:36,040
and actually the book ends,

381
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:40,570
the last two and a half pages is a Coda
to the book that actually talks about

382
00:23:40,571 --> 00:23:44,380
the biggest impact and the greatest
discovery was how much it affected people.

383
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:48,940
Just people just inspired people
to stem careers and was, you know,

384
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:53,330
a moonshot for a new
generation of, uh, of,

385
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:58,640
uh, millennials basically
and how it affected them. So,

386
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,190
but all those things are good.
We don't have to choose between them.

387
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,050
We've got all the scientific knowledge,

388
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:06,590
all the breakthroughs and how you do
low cost space flight to the planets.

389
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:10,730
We got all the engineering advances
and we got all the inspiration.

390
00:24:11,630 --> 00:24:15,320
So there's no reason to
rank them there. Yeah.

391
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:19,860
And you never have one without the other
because without the motivation for the

392
00:24:19,861 --> 00:24:20,694
exploration,

393
00:24:20,790 --> 00:24:23,310
you're not going to have a mission
with all that technical innovation.

394
00:24:23,311 --> 00:24:24,690
But without all the technical innovation,

395
00:24:24,691 --> 00:24:27,390
you're not going to have a mission and
get the science. But, but you know,

396
00:24:27,391 --> 00:24:29,040
it wasn't just odd has
a core or something.

397
00:24:29,041 --> 00:24:32,570
It actually was fundamental
what we've learned there and,

398
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:36,060
and changed our paradigms and will truly,
it sounds like a cliche,

399
00:24:36,061 --> 00:24:41,061
but we truly require textbooks
to be rewritten because
we did not expect a small

400
00:24:42,210 --> 00:24:47,210
planet on the fringes of the solar
system to be so geologically active and

401
00:24:47,881 --> 00:24:49,230
diverse and vibrant and,

402
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:52,350
and parts of it to be quite young
and still currently forming.

403
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:56,520
And that was something we
had to, you know, go back to
the drawing boards and now,

404
00:24:56,530 --> 00:25:00,030
um, have some provisional
explanations. But that, you know,

405
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:03,560
that's how that's really
what drives science, uh,

406
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:08,070
is this exploration that then leads
to results that, uh, you know,

407
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:12,330
that shows us that our prediction and
our previous knowledge was wrong and

408
00:25:12,331 --> 00:25:16,740
requires us to really a re reinvent
our theories of planetary evolution.

409
00:25:16,741 --> 00:25:18,090
And New Horizons has done that.

410
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:21,370
You might say, you know, you might
imagine this, but as a science team,

411
00:25:21,371 --> 00:25:23,830
everybody want to make predictions.
And we actually had a poll and we,

412
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:27,600
we had a meeting a couple months before
the fly by and one of my postdocs,

413
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:30,850
Amanda's and gory, ran the pole. There
were like 30 questions and you know,

414
00:25:30,851 --> 00:25:33,310
we had a little little team
that put together the questions,

415
00:25:33,311 --> 00:25:35,950
everybody answered them and we put
the results in the computer of course,

416
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:40,840
and we're plotting the distribution of
the histogram of how many satellites do

417
00:25:40,841 --> 00:25:44,020
you think we will find or how many
people think that we'll find evidence for

418
00:25:44,021 --> 00:25:48,280
active volcanism on the surface or
whatever the questions were. And so, uh,

419
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:49,780
and then we showed that to everybody.

420
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:53,320
And then a couple of months after the
flyby when we had enough data to sort of

421
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:55,670
understand the lay of the land,
um,

422
00:25:56,410 --> 00:26:00,070
I scored that against the
real Pluto and it was pitiful.

423
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:06,430
And so like I gave the team, I
literally passed out report cards. Yes.

424
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:11,460
And they gave all A's for exploration and
F's for scientific predictive ability.

425
00:26:12,430 --> 00:26:14,960
Yes. Yeah. Firstly, thank you
for the monkeys reference.

426
00:26:16,690 --> 00:26:17,361
Is the,

427
00:26:17,361 --> 00:26:22,361
your subtitle optimistic about first
mission or do you know of upcoming

428
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:23,414
missions?

429
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:28,610
Oh, both. Both. Both. And
we actually almost, we had a
debate about whether, I mean,

430
00:26:28,611 --> 00:26:31,430
there's only been one mission,
so I would just say first, right.

431
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:35,720
It's just the epic mission to
Pluto. Isn't that enough? Um, uh,

432
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:39,170
but first it's one of those words
that it's like an Seo thing, right?

433
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,040
It's got to get people to look at it.
Um,

434
00:26:41,450 --> 00:26:44,840
but we do expect that there
will be more missions because I,

435
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:47,250
and we originally thought that this was,

436
00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:52,830
that we could go in with 21st century
instrumentation and accomplish and we did

437
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:57,030
about the equivalent of the first 20 years
of Mars exploration in one fell swoop.

438
00:26:57,870 --> 00:27:02,760
Uh, and we did, but we
learned many things that are,

439
00:27:03,210 --> 00:27:04,080
make my head hurt.

440
00:27:04,770 --> 00:27:09,770
And so w we're working very hard to see
an orbiter fly there and follow up and I

441
00:27:09,871 --> 00:27:13,920
think there'll be now other missions to
small planets in the Kuiper belt because

442
00:27:13,921 --> 00:27:16,170
we want to sample the diversity
of this new population.

443
00:27:16,730 --> 00:27:19,810
I think if Pluto was that interesting and
some of the things we know from ground

444
00:27:19,811 --> 00:27:23,460
based and the huddle soon
we'll know from James Webb. Um,

445
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:27,180
I think that will also want to look at,
at some of the others for comparison.

446
00:27:27,930 --> 00:27:30,390
So I expect there'll be
a lot more of this. Yes.

447
00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:33,410
The risk of being a little bit

448
00:27:35,090 --> 00:27:39,410
to weigh in on the merits of manned
space exploration versus for Monica space

449
00:27:39,411 --> 00:27:41,110
exploration.
And I,

450
00:27:41,290 --> 00:27:45,620
I asked this one is because we living
in a positive in front of the country

451
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:51,230
as citizens get to me in on where
we put our dollars. Do you think,

452
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:54,770
do you think the public's perception of
this is aligned with your perception of

453
00:27:54,771 --> 00:27:55,560
this?

454
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:58,630
Oh, well that's a different question,
but I will weigh in and I was,

455
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:03,720
so you said weigh in on the merits of
robotic space flight versus human space

456
00:28:04,601 --> 00:28:08,740
flight. Right. So I might translate
that question to an equivalent question.

457
00:28:08,741 --> 00:28:13,741
Would you please weigh in for me on the
merits of a knife and fork and a spoon

458
00:28:14,471 --> 00:28:16,540
at the table?
Um,

459
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:19,780
my point is they're all different tools
for different purposes and at the table

460
00:28:19,870 --> 00:28:24,280
you really need all three. It's really
hard to do your soup with a fork and it's,

461
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:28,720
it's really hard to cut your steak
with just the spoon or the fork.

462
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:33,900
And so human space flight and robotic
space flight are really very different

463
00:28:35,381 --> 00:28:36,214
tools.

464
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:42,300
I don't know anybody in this time that
would say you need human space flight to

465
00:28:42,971 --> 00:28:47,110
do weather satellites, communication
satellites and a lot of the applications,

466
00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:50,600
but it's still the case that
humans make much better, um,

467
00:28:50,650 --> 00:28:54,520
field analysis teams then
the rovers that we have now,

468
00:28:55,530 --> 00:29:00,460
Apollo teams would cover about as much
ground scientifically in a three day

469
00:29:00,461 --> 00:29:04,270
expedition as a rover mission
can't in five years. Uh,

470
00:29:04,330 --> 00:29:07,930
and they can make on the spot
discoveries that robots can. Um,

471
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:10,640
so I think we need both all
the tools and the, you know,

472
00:29:10,970 --> 00:29:15,220
we're not going to be sending
people to Pluto anytime soon. Um,

473
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:16,090
but on the other hand,

474
00:29:16,150 --> 00:29:20,260
at places like the moon and Mars and
maybe series and smaller asteroids,

475
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:24,250
the humans can really push the pedal to
the metal and the humans do something.

476
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:28,840
Even though new horizons was a good
example of being inspirational,

477
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:31,660
it's hard for the 23rd
mission to Mars for that,

478
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:34,330
that particular robot to
really light people's fire.

479
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:39,940
Whereas when we send men and women,
it,

480
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,530
it will be unbelievable in
terms of the worldwide response.

481
00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:48,400
And that's what fuels the tech economy
in a space as the gateway drug to

482
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:51,430
engineering and science careers.
Well dinosaurs too,

483
00:29:51,431 --> 00:29:55,330
but the dinosaurs always lose.
Right? So it's really space.

484
00:29:56,170 --> 00:29:57,003
Who else?
Yes.

485
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:03,160
How long did it take after march for you
read the paper or see a tech report and

486
00:30:04,610 --> 00:30:06,860
wish that was something you had had

487
00:30:07,130 --> 00:30:08,120
on board?
Yes.

488
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:12,920
So we've talked about that too.
And,

489
00:30:13,430 --> 00:30:18,430
and so the two ways to look at that and
the only realistic way to look at it is

490
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:23,360
given the, the boundary conditions
on money and schedule and the,

491
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:26,930
and the Arrow that we built
it between 2001 and five,

492
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:29,780
what would you do differently?
That means a zero sum game.

493
00:30:30,170 --> 00:30:34,850
You have to find the money, the mass, the
resources by taking something else off.

494
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,010
And,
uh,

495
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:41,450
there's no instrument or capability on
New Horizons that we wish we would trade,

496
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:44,840
that we would lose in order to do
something else. Now with the orbiter,

497
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:49,450
which will be a much more capable
spacecraft in a much, um, uh,

498
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:54,620
a wider variety of payloads on board
instruments will do lots of things we

499
00:30:54,711 --> 00:30:56,230
couldn't do with a simple fly by,

500
00:30:56,810 --> 00:31:00,650
but I wouldn't trade anything if
I really could just, you know,

501
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:05,180
have my wish it would have been that we
had enough money to fly to because the

502
00:31:05,181 --> 00:31:08,420
far side of Pluto and its satellites is,
you know,

503
00:31:08,421 --> 00:31:12,290
we can only see them for
millions of kilometers away
as we were screaming up and

504
00:31:12,291 --> 00:31:15,110
then they turned away.
And it's frustrating.

505
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:19,460
You look at the other side of Pluto
and it looks completely different and

506
00:31:19,461 --> 00:31:23,780
fascinating. And what does that
have to teach us, you know, and, uh,

507
00:31:23,990 --> 00:31:27,680
I'm really betting on life extension so
that I can be Pii. That next mission.

508
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:30,350
Yeah.
Right here

509
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:35,550
it was a publicly funded, at a timeless,
not clear what the future holds for that.

510
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:38,940
Um,
what do you think is likely to happen?

511
00:31:38,941 --> 00:31:41,670
What do you think should happen in terms
of public versus private funding for

512
00:31:41,671 --> 00:31:42,504
this thing?

513
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:47,390
Well, fortunately, and everybody here
probably knows this, this is that, um,

514
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:50,110
uh,
commercial spaces coming on very strong.

515
00:31:50,650 --> 00:31:55,650
And I admit I am a very highly biased and
also happened to be the board chair of

516
00:31:57,641 --> 00:31:59,860
the commercial spaceflight federation,

517
00:31:59,861 --> 00:32:03,920
which is the industry of
Federation that blue origin and,

518
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:09,080
and space x and everybody else's in
80 corporations from small mom and pop

519
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:14,430
almost shops, you know, all the way
up to space x and blue origin. Uh,

520
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:19,790
uh, but I think again, it's not a
choice between one and the other. Um,

521
00:32:20,830 --> 00:32:24,970
this is a huge solar system
with dozens of worlds.

522
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:27,430
And you know, I, I don't,

523
00:32:28,090 --> 00:32:30,670
I don't know how we would,

524
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:35,140
we would do all the things that we do
on the season in the air if it was all

525
00:32:35,141 --> 00:32:39,130
done by just the air force and
the navy. Right. And besides,

526
00:32:39,410 --> 00:32:40,520
if it's one organization,

527
00:32:40,550 --> 00:32:44,000
you can't possibly have the
level of innovation that
you get through competition.

528
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:50,080
And so I think all that's going on at
places like blue origin and SpaceX and all

529
00:32:51,321 --> 00:32:56,321
the others is it's finally the 21st
century where we don't just have one space

530
00:32:56,391 --> 00:33:01,040
program but lots of them. And
now we're starting to have, uh,

531
00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:06,190
the asteroid miners and the moon miners
and lots more applications being talked

532
00:33:06,831 --> 00:33:09,350
about. And I think the 20s are
going to be just spectacular,

533
00:33:09,650 --> 00:33:14,490
but also what NASA is going to be doing
in the 20s, which you would not see. Um,

534
00:33:15,010 --> 00:33:19,820
uh, uh, commercial enterprise is
exploring Europa for scientific knowledge,

535
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:25,010
but you might see commercial
enterprises sending payloads to Mars,

536
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:29,470
uh, because they can, uh, they can find
customers that want to fly those now.

537
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:31,180
So sort of the vanguard,

538
00:33:31,190 --> 00:33:35,330
the leading edge I think is always going
to be the government in most respects.

539
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:38,930
Um, but, uh, private
industries, what comes in and,

540
00:33:38,931 --> 00:33:43,310
and really turns it into part
of the economy and what we do.

541
00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:45,140
And we need both.

542
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:49,910
And nobody at NASA that I know,
we both know a lot of people at NASA.

543
00:33:49,911 --> 00:33:53,180
I know nobody. There is a,
you know, bummed out that, oh,

544
00:33:53,181 --> 00:33:56,000
now that we have these competitors
from frappe from private industry,

545
00:33:56,001 --> 00:33:57,590
they're like, oh great, you know,

546
00:33:57,591 --> 00:34:01,280
we don't have to be the trucking
service up to orbit or the bus service,

547
00:34:01,490 --> 00:34:05,480
you know, we can focus on other
things that only NASA can do. And um,

548
00:34:05,481 --> 00:34:10,100
so the private public partnership is
really being sought by both sides in that

549
00:34:10,101 --> 00:34:15,101
equation and is shaping up to really
accelerate space space exploration in the

550
00:34:15,481 --> 00:34:16,314
in this century.

551
00:34:16,890 --> 00:34:18,300
Yeah.
And Jim Bryden Stein,

552
00:34:18,301 --> 00:34:23,280
who the new NASA administrator really
gets it with public private partnerships.

553
00:34:23,281 --> 00:34:25,290
I think he's going to be great.
I'm left handed,

554
00:34:25,291 --> 00:34:28,080
so I've been biasing to this side of the
room. Is there any question over here?

555
00:34:28,180 --> 00:34:32,140
Yes. Um, so this is not
the only recent, uh,

556
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:36,700
exploratory mission to an IFI body in
the solar system because we also had the

557
00:34:36,701 --> 00:34:40,680
Rosetta probe, uh, to the comment. I
was wondering if there was anything,

558
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:42,660
especially in the astrobiology factor,

559
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:47,710
maybe that stood out like that was
surprisingly different or suppressing the

560
00:34:48,131 --> 00:34:52,690
same between Pluto and the
comic. His name, I forgot. Well,

561
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:55,480
can I just say Jeremy Knauff gear?
Reza Minka

562
00:34:58,020 --> 00:35:02,370
very nicely done. Well, I was on the
Rosetta mission. Yeah. 22 years. Yeah.

563
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:06,660
So we do call it CG. It was
too much. So, so Alan can,

564
00:35:06,690 --> 00:35:09,320
I can probably comment,
you know,

565
00:35:09,330 --> 00:35:12,450
more in a more sophisticated way about
the comments since he's on that mission.

566
00:35:12,451 --> 00:35:14,820
But I will say from an
astrobiology perspective,

567
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:19,720
one of the amazing things about
new horizons and Pluto is the, uh,

568
00:35:19,890 --> 00:35:24,890
evidence that there is an ocean of liquid
water beneath the icy crust of Pluto.

569
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:30,630
Uh, it seems like there, there's
circumstantial evidence that, you know,

570
00:35:30,631 --> 00:35:34,830
there are features of the planet that
are easiest to explain if there is a

571
00:35:34,831 --> 00:35:35,730
liquid water ocean.

572
00:35:35,731 --> 00:35:38,790
And one of the things that would
definitely to do with this orbiter Alan's

573
00:35:38,791 --> 00:35:42,620
talking about if we go back,
is map the,

574
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:46,590
the gravity field and do other things
to really make sure we understand that

575
00:35:46,591 --> 00:35:49,830
that's true. But it seeming like
there is an ocean of liquid water,

576
00:35:49,831 --> 00:35:54,150
which is amazing from an astrobiology
perspective because any place where

577
00:35:54,151 --> 00:35:58,050
there's an ocean of water is a candidate
for extra terrestrial life. So,

578
00:35:58,051 --> 00:36:02,880
just as you've heard about Europa and
Enceladus as possible homes for life

579
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:05,760
underneath the ice, we really have
to add, plead out to that list now.

580
00:36:06,870 --> 00:36:08,460
Yeah. And you know, keep in mind,

581
00:36:08,790 --> 00:36:12,150
so I was Pi of the ultraviolet
spectrometer and Rosetta. Okay.

582
00:36:12,151 --> 00:36:17,151
So we won that project in the beginning
of 1996 and flight mission and in 2016

583
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:23,680
and actually the data analysis part
of the project is still ongoing. Um,

584
00:36:24,210 --> 00:36:26,310
but you know,
the comments CG,

585
00:36:26,311 --> 00:36:31,080
the one with all the syllables is about
the size of Cambridge mass and Pluto is

586
00:36:31,081 --> 00:36:32,400
the surface area,
the United States.

587
00:36:32,401 --> 00:36:35,520
So it's a different scale and the kind of
science you're doing is very different.

588
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:37,533
What else?

589
00:36:38,270 --> 00:36:41,830
Yup. What, what's like the biggest, um,

590
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:46,690
what was the most frustrating mistake
that you look back on of like, oh,

591
00:36:46,691 --> 00:36:49,630
we didn't do this right if I need
to go back and change one thing.

592
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:51,520
What was the biggest takeaway?

593
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:56,980
Wow, that's a good question.
Um, I honestly, the way,

594
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:00,970
the thing that nearly killed the
spacecraft 10 days out, but it,

595
00:37:00,971 --> 00:37:04,730
sure it brought a lot of viewership
the last minute.

596
00:37:04,731 --> 00:37:07,390
And all of a sudden it's life or death.
What,

597
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:11,550
there were some other mistakes that, that,
that, uh, we described in the book, but,

598
00:37:11,850 --> 00:37:15,180
you know, fortunately none of them were
fatal because we have a success story.

599
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:19,740
Right? So, but I mean, but they're
illustrative. There was that, uh,

600
00:37:20,430 --> 00:37:21,001
you know,
I mean,

601
00:37:21,001 --> 00:37:24,420
one thing you learn in this book is
how carefully everything was checked by

602
00:37:24,421 --> 00:37:26,160
independent teams and you know,

603
00:37:26,161 --> 00:37:29,340
like just a lot of amazing troubleshooting
and very little slip through.

604
00:37:29,341 --> 00:37:32,820
But there was one
spreadsheet where, um, one,

605
00:37:33,330 --> 00:37:38,330
a thruster had the wrong specs and was
built and flown with the wrong specs so

606
00:37:38,521 --> 00:37:41,550
that it was going to fire too many times,
uh,

607
00:37:41,551 --> 00:37:44,770
and exhausted lifetime
before they got to put out.

608
00:37:44,771 --> 00:37:48,520
And they discovered this when they were
in flight and they were able to, uh,

609
00:37:48,550 --> 00:37:51,180
to make some work arounds.
But that was a,

610
00:37:51,181 --> 00:37:53,730
that was sort of almost the exception
that proves the rule because there were,

611
00:37:53,731 --> 00:37:56,100
so,
it was almost nothing like that,

612
00:37:56,101 --> 00:37:59,760
but it was really illustrative of why
it was so important that they do all the

613
00:37:59,761 --> 00:38:03,500
ridiculous amount of checking
and double checking, uh, console.

614
00:38:03,501 --> 00:38:05,860
So little slip through, but
that, that was, you know,

615
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:08,910
it made me not the worst mistake, but
it's an illustrative mistake. Yeah, yeah,

616
00:38:09,250 --> 00:38:11,500
yeah. Um, I'm really, I'm sorry,

617
00:38:11,501 --> 00:38:15,490
I really don't have a good answer because
most of the things that I think I did

618
00:38:15,491 --> 00:38:19,000
wrong or we did wrong actually
in the end worked out better.

619
00:38:20,110 --> 00:38:23,350
So for example,
if I could do it again,

620
00:38:23,351 --> 00:38:26,920
some of the things I was doing in the 90s
to lead the effort to get a mission to

621
00:38:26,921 --> 00:38:31,820
Pluto, I think now with more experience,
I could've made it happen, but,

622
00:38:31,890 --> 00:38:35,290
but then I would've just been a bit
player on that mission instead of been to

623
00:38:35,470 --> 00:38:37,390
lead the whole thing.
So I don't want to make that happen.

624
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:41,880
So it was a lot more fun. Yeah. You Go,

625
00:38:42,750 --> 00:38:47,420
I have a question with regards again and
lot of the story here in force around

626
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:49,550
politics and political struggle.

627
00:38:49,790 --> 00:38:54,710
And I was wondering the fact that Pluto
at some point was demoted or was it part

628
00:38:54,711 --> 00:38:57,070
of a political game?
How can you explain?

629
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:01,520
I don't think it was a
political game. Um, there,

630
00:39:01,530 --> 00:39:03,450
there are really two
things that were going on.

631
00:39:04,230 --> 00:39:06,900
One is I think appreciated
by a lot of people,

632
00:39:06,901 --> 00:39:11,040
which is I think especially here you
have this fixation, no astronomers,

633
00:39:11,041 --> 00:39:14,760
not planetary scientists,
different expertise. When I
give a public talk, you know,

634
00:39:14,761 --> 00:39:18,600
I say neurologists and podiatrist's don't
go to one for problem with the other,

635
00:39:19,170 --> 00:39:22,860
right, different expertise. But people
in the public, including my own mother,

636
00:39:22,861 --> 00:39:27,210
confuses that all astronomers must know
everything about everything in space.

637
00:39:27,630 --> 00:39:32,520
They were really trying to cope with
large numbers of planet discoveries and

638
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:34,710
thinking in a 20th century way.

639
00:39:34,711 --> 00:39:38,160
I would say that the number of planets
should be small so children can remember

640
00:39:38,161 --> 00:39:42,280
their names, right? Um,
um, they should have,

641
00:39:42,330 --> 00:39:46,560
I wish that they'd just been consistent
and not gone on for an head motions.

642
00:39:46,561 --> 00:39:49,740
They'd voted on other things they don't
know about and just gone ahead and

643
00:39:49,741 --> 00:39:53,070
legislate it. We're only also going to
have eight elements in eight states now,

644
00:39:53,470 --> 00:39:54,660
but,
but they didn't.

645
00:39:54,690 --> 00:39:59,690
So the press picked up on it and the press
is also naively took it as expertise,

646
00:40:00,860 --> 00:40:01,680
you know,
and,

647
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:06,680
and sort of made it a feta complete when
people like David and myself and others

648
00:40:07,771 --> 00:40:11,490
in planetary science and joining
profession of a different expertise,

649
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:15,660
never said that and don't buy it and don't
even by the idea of voting in science

650
00:40:15,661 --> 00:40:19,800
because it's sort of an
illegitimate process, right?
We could all vote that, um,

651
00:40:20,070 --> 00:40:21,510
three of evolution is wrong.

652
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:24,930
It doesn't matter how many
Nobel laureates vote for it.

653
00:40:25,170 --> 00:40:29,010
That doesn't mean that the data
doesn't support the theory. Okay. Um,

654
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:32,490
the other thing that was going on,
and it's very rarely discussed,

655
00:40:32,491 --> 00:40:37,491
but it's the fact is that in 1980
on astronomer named Brian Marsden,

656
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:39,870
who was very accomplished,

657
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:45,440
had a very public tiff with the man who
discovered Pluto named Clyde Tombow.

658
00:40:46,410 --> 00:40:50,640
And he, he actually said at a
meeting in front of a lot of people,

659
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:55,140
you're older than me, and when you're
gone, I will erase your legacy.

660
00:40:56,160 --> 00:41:01,160
And Marsden is the person that led the
IAU that week to pass that resolution,

661
00:41:03,430 --> 00:41:08,120
uh, which took Pluto off the
strong hummers list. And so

662
00:41:09,740 --> 00:41:10,880
there's a lot of bad blood.

663
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:16,860
And if you look at the specific
technical description in,

664
00:41:17,450 --> 00:41:21,140
in the IAU Aaus attempt to
at redefining planet, uh,

665
00:41:21,141 --> 00:41:25,580
just from a of scientific
quantitative perspective,

666
00:41:25,581 --> 00:41:29,960
it doesn't make any sense. It they
did a sloppy job. Well for one thing,

667
00:41:29,961 --> 00:41:31,730
they set a planet has to orbit the Sun.

668
00:41:31,731 --> 00:41:34,730
They ignored all the exoplanets
is ridiculous. But also,

669
00:41:34,731 --> 00:41:38,810
even within our own solar system, they
have this criteria that a planet must,

670
00:41:38,811 --> 00:41:41,180
a supposedly they said
it must clear it zone.

671
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:46,010
So they define the planet in terms of
what orbits around it and not its own

672
00:41:46,011 --> 00:41:49,070
intrinsic properties.
And that leads to some very silly,

673
00:41:50,030 --> 00:41:54,890
absurd conclusions like that earth was
not a planet for its first 500 million

674
00:41:54,891 --> 00:41:58,070
years because it was orbiting in a
swarm of material left over from the

675
00:41:58,071 --> 00:42:01,910
formation of the sun. And if you took
earth today and move to somewhere else,

676
00:42:01,911 --> 00:42:06,360
say out in the asteroid belt or something,
it would not be a planet. Um, so there,

677
00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:09,470
there are a lot of just sort of
unsatisfying aspects of the definition.

678
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:11,660
So it certainly made sense to,
um,

679
00:42:12,170 --> 00:42:16,820
to talk about classifying Pluto and other
small planets like it as a different

680
00:42:16,910 --> 00:42:19,790
subclass of planets dwarf
planets that that's fine.

681
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:23,330
But then they sort of added this and a
dwarf planet is not a planet and it was

682
00:42:23,331 --> 00:42:26,010
kind of vindictive and
nonsensical. And, uh,

683
00:42:26,030 --> 00:42:28,520
so in planetary science at our meetings,

684
00:42:28,730 --> 00:42:32,570
you'll hear us referring to Pluto
as a planet. Um, and you know,

685
00:42:32,571 --> 00:42:36,140
we almost kind of don't really even want
to want to talk about this except for,

686
00:42:36,141 --> 00:42:36,321
I mean,

687
00:42:36,321 --> 00:42:39,590
it is worth talking about because people
are confused in and they want to know

688
00:42:39,591 --> 00:42:42,830
and so we have to try to clarify it. He
said, we don't want to talk about it,

689
00:42:42,831 --> 00:42:46,860
but yesterday in the Washington
Post, two of us had an op Ed. Yeah.

690
00:42:47,670 --> 00:42:51,870
How many plants are there on
your list? Oh, I'm comfortable.

691
00:42:52,050 --> 00:42:54,600
So yeah, that's really the answer. No.

692
00:42:55,450 --> 00:42:59,400
So I'll known it's in the mid twenties
in our solar system, in our solar system.

693
00:42:59,490 --> 00:43:02,160
But of course there are thousands
of known planets around other stars,

694
00:43:02,490 --> 00:43:04,890
but you know, who cares? You know,

695
00:43:04,891 --> 00:43:08,160
there's countless mountains and rivers
and stars and asteroids and galaxies and

696
00:43:08,161 --> 00:43:11,850
all those things, you know, spaces
all about Oh, astronomical numbers.

697
00:43:13,550 --> 00:43:15,630
So we really need to get over the notion,

698
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:18,210
the notion that there were
small number of planets,

699
00:43:19,020 --> 00:43:20,630
I think is equivalent to like some,

700
00:43:20,970 --> 00:43:23,820
somebody who grew up on a desert island
where they were accountable number of

701
00:43:23,821 --> 00:43:24,654
palm trees.

702
00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:27,780
And you think that's it for the world
because you don't see any other islands.

703
00:43:27,781 --> 00:43:28,351
So you know,

704
00:43:28,351 --> 00:43:32,100
they're all over the rise and then you
develop the technology for ocean travel,

705
00:43:32,970 --> 00:43:36,810
right? And you can now go to other places
and you discover that all those trees,

706
00:43:36,811 --> 00:43:41,010
you gave them names, right? There's
so many. You can't name them all.

707
00:43:41,550 --> 00:43:45,870
So you decide those aren't actually
palm trees for whatever reason,

708
00:43:46,020 --> 00:43:49,140
just to keep it small. So
it's kind of crazy. Okay.

709
00:43:49,230 --> 00:43:51,590
I guess we're going to
say thank you for that.

710
00:43:52,150 --> 00:43:56,800
[inaudible].
