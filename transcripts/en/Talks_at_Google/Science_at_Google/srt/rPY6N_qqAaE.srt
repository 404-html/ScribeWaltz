1
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:08,430
Thank you very much for giving me the
opportunity to talk with you guys today.

2
00:00:08,431 --> 00:00:12,390
So, um, yeah, I'm a computational
astrophysicist. So you know,

3
00:00:12,391 --> 00:00:16,140
my day job is not thinking about aliens.
Um, they've kind of my night job.

4
00:00:16,141 --> 00:00:21,141
So my day job is studying things like
how stars form and how planets evaporate.

5
00:00:21,721 --> 00:00:25,700
I do a magneto fluid, large
scale supercomputer Nitos, uh,

6
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:29,490
fluid dynamical simulations
of astrophysical cas dynamics.

7
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,690
But because I do a lot of work with the
public, you know, I've been thinking,

8
00:00:33,691 --> 00:00:36,450
I've ended up having to think a lot
about climate change cause I write about

9
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:39,200
climate change, um, and
over the years, you know,

10
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:43,080
I've had to deal with a lot of climate
denial and that is unbelievably

11
00:00:43,081 --> 00:00:46,190
frustrating. And in deal doing that, um,

12
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:49,950
I came to start thinking about the
problem differently about how, you know,

13
00:00:49,951 --> 00:00:54,951
ways of the ways in which we frame
climate change entirely wrong.

14
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,440
Um, and so that's really what
the, the topic of my book
is. So light of the stars,

15
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:01,650
Alien Worlds and the fate of the earth.
Uh,

16
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:05,040
so what I want to take you through
is kind of a different perspective on

17
00:01:05,041 --> 00:01:06,780
thinking about climate change,
um,

18
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:09,510
from what I would call the
astrobiological perspective.

19
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:14,340
So the idea here is you can't solve a
problem until you understand it and you

20
00:01:14,341 --> 00:01:17,010
can't understand it until
you can tell its story.

21
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:20,850
And my premise here is that the story
we're telling about climate change is the

22
00:01:20,851 --> 00:01:23,070
wrong story.
And it's not our fault,

23
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:26,490
it's just that we're in a different
position now and we can tell a different

24
00:01:26,491 --> 00:01:30,930
story. And the story we're trying to tell
about, uh, the, the, is the human future,

25
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:35,490
what is the human future on
a climate changing planet.

26
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:36,511
But in some sense,

27
00:01:36,511 --> 00:01:39,810
really what I'm asking you is what does
the future for any civilization, um,

28
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,900
a large scale industrial
civilization on any planet?

29
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:47,400
I'm going to take you through why
that's not a crazy question to ask. Um,

30
00:01:47,401 --> 00:01:49,730
so the problem we know is
climate change, right? That, uh,

31
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:55,130
the Anthropocene anthropogenically
driven a change in the planetary state,

32
00:01:55,850 --> 00:02:00,570
um, that we are switching from a state
for the last 10,000 years that's been

33
00:02:00,571 --> 00:02:04,470
basically warm and moist. Uh, meaning
most of the stuff isn't a lot.

34
00:02:04,471 --> 00:02:07,800
Most of them are not most but lots
of the waters and locked up in ice to

35
00:02:07,801 --> 00:02:11,310
something, um, that we don't know, right?
We're pushing the earth into a new state.

36
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:15,060
And then there's also a couple to this
are issues of resource depletion from

37
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:19,830
freshwater to forests. Um, so you know,
this issue of sustainability comes up,

38
00:02:19,831 --> 00:02:22,770
right? Can we build a sustainable
version of our planet?

39
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:25,190
And when we think about
science and politics, right?

40
00:02:25,191 --> 00:02:27,600
Cause that's somehow whenever we
want to have this conversation,

41
00:02:27,601 --> 00:02:30,900
that immediately falls
into the political domain.

42
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:33,030
And while certainly policy is a pillow,
you know,

43
00:02:33,031 --> 00:02:36,690
there's going to be politics to science
itself is what gets cast suddenly

44
00:02:36,691 --> 00:02:39,540
becomes political. And when you think
about this, it's really amazing.

45
00:02:39,541 --> 00:02:43,410
And when I did the research for
this book, I realized that, um,

46
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:48,440
or I found that actually a president
in 1965 gave a speech to Congress

47
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:53,070
identifying CO2 and climate change
as a potential problem, right?

48
00:02:53,071 --> 00:02:56,160
So the idea that somehow this is
this modern hoax that, uh, you know,

49
00:02:56,161 --> 00:02:58,860
climate denialist wanted to tell
you about is this gives lie to it,

50
00:02:58,861 --> 00:03:03,250
that know in 1965 actually that should
be President Johnson gave a speech before

51
00:03:03,251 --> 00:03:04,580
Congress where he, you know, uh,

52
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:09,190
mentioned CO2 as a and the climate
change as a particular problem.

53
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:13,660
But so we know what's happening now is
this political polarization that somehow

54
00:03:13,661 --> 00:03:18,661
this science issue got lumped into all
the other kinds of polarization that we

55
00:03:18,761 --> 00:03:22,000
have. So if you have a certain
set of beliefs for some reason,

56
00:03:22,001 --> 00:03:25,270
you also have to think that climate
change is a hoax or climate change isn't

57
00:03:25,271 --> 00:03:26,130
happening.
Um,

58
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:30,250
and that's part of the dilemma we face
and trying to take any action on the

59
00:03:30,251 --> 00:03:33,340
problem. So what is the
real problem? You know,

60
00:03:33,341 --> 00:03:37,830
what is the real problem that we're
facing? Um, and it's really one of a,

61
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,220
a perspective,

62
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:42,610
not politics because the science right
has been settled for a long time.

63
00:03:42,611 --> 00:03:45,430
My first job after undergraduate,

64
00:03:45,431 --> 00:03:48,370
I took a year and a half off and I did
lots of crazy things like planting trees

65
00:03:48,371 --> 00:03:51,990
in British Columbia. I was a bouncer at
the rocky horror picture show on the,

66
00:03:51,991 --> 00:03:56,570
the eighth street playhouse in New York.
But I also got a job in 1985 add, um,

67
00:03:56,590 --> 00:04:01,050
Jim Hansen's Goddard Institute for Space
Studies. And you know, I asked them, yeah,

68
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:03,400
it was a programmer, basically a
scientific program. And I said, yeah,

69
00:04:03,401 --> 00:04:05,200
what are we doing here? And
they said, Oh, you know,

70
00:04:05,201 --> 00:04:07,660
we're studying to see whether or not
the climate is going to be changing.

71
00:04:07,661 --> 00:04:10,120
That's an idea we have. And
I was like, whoa. Right.

72
00:04:10,121 --> 00:04:14,230
So this was 1985 long before anybody
else had heard of it. By 1988,

73
00:04:14,231 --> 00:04:18,240
Hanson gives that very famous,
uh, uh, testimony in front
of Congress saying like,

74
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:21,820
look, we actually have found the signal.
So the, you know, the science is old.

75
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:23,980
And so the science is not the problem.

76
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,920
It's the perspective that's the
problem and our perspective.

77
00:04:26,921 --> 00:04:29,830
And I think the reason we have
such a hard time, uh, you know,

78
00:04:29,831 --> 00:04:33,430
the public and I deal a lot with the
public and for my science writing is that,

79
00:04:33,431 --> 00:04:37,030
um, we think it's a onetime story. We
think we are a one time story, right?

80
00:04:37,031 --> 00:04:40,760
We think climate change is something
happening to us and you know,

81
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,830
that's the only time it's ever happened
and there's no guides, no examples,

82
00:04:44,831 --> 00:04:49,831
no other no way of framing this that
allows us to see something deeper in it.

83
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:53,200
So a, so all we ended up doing is fighting
about whether it's happening or not.

84
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:57,700
Okay. So what I'm going to argue in
the book is that we have to broaden the

85
00:04:57,701 --> 00:05:01,330
perspective to truly understand,
uh, what is truly happening.

86
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:02,980
That's the basic idea here.

87
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:07,390
So what I mean by that is we must
learn to think like a planet.

88
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:10,180
And that is something that,
you know, over our history,

89
00:05:10,181 --> 00:05:12,580
our 10,000 year history of civilization,

90
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:16,480
we'd never been called upon to do before.
And by civilization,

91
00:05:16,481 --> 00:05:19,570
what I mean is agriculture city building,
right?

92
00:05:19,571 --> 00:05:21,340
Clearly human beings have
been around longer than that,

93
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:23,830
but it's in the post hole a scene or that,
you know,

94
00:05:23,831 --> 00:05:26,570
after the ice it last ice ages
and did not post Holocene.

95
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:30,280
But after post ice age that,
you know, we built this kind of,

96
00:05:30,281 --> 00:05:34,600
we started building this kind of
civilization and it's only now that we,

97
00:05:34,601 --> 00:05:38,020
the planet is starting to notice that
we're here and in order to deal with the

98
00:05:38,021 --> 00:05:40,780
problem, we're going to have to start
thinking the way a planet thinks.

99
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:44,290
And what I want to argue is we've only
learned how to do that in the last 20

100
00:05:44,291 --> 00:05:48,160
years or so for a bunch of reasons.
Okay. So a little test, um,

101
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:49,450
which of these is the earth,

102
00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:56,680
but is it all of them? All of them. Yeah,
that's right. That's exactly the question.

103
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:59,480
I, Oh yeah, I'm going glad when
people see that. Right? So, you know,

104
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:02,470
the idea here is here's six
different earths, right? That this,

105
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:06,500
this one is the earth. Uh, and in
the Hadean right after it was formed,

106
00:06:06,501 --> 00:06:08,420
it was a liquid magma ocean.
Uh,

107
00:06:08,421 --> 00:06:10,580
this is a version of the
earth that was a waterworld.

108
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:13,580
It took a while for the continents to
grow. So when you, when you see those,

109
00:06:13,581 --> 00:06:15,890
you know, animations of the
continents sliding all around,

110
00:06:15,891 --> 00:06:18,860
those only go back a few,
a hundred million years or so.

111
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,950
Because in the beginning all we had were
what were called Creighton's. They were,

112
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,220
it took a while for the continence
to grow. So earth was a waterworld.

113
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:28,820
There were periods when the planet has
been so warm that's had been virtually no

114
00:06:28,821 --> 00:06:31,370
ice anywhere on it.
So we've been a jungle world.

115
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:34,010
There's been periods when the
earth has been a snowball,

116
00:06:34,011 --> 00:06:38,780
basically glaciated almost from top to
bottom or from a pole to the equator.

117
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:42,080
Here's the earth. We have the happier
as we know now. And here is the earth.

118
00:06:42,081 --> 00:06:42,291
You know,

119
00:06:42,291 --> 00:06:46,190
it actually not all that long and maybe
another 2 billion years or so that as

120
00:06:46,191 --> 00:06:49,350
the sun heats up, like any main
sequence star, we'll do, um,

121
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:52,730
the temperature is going to get high
enough to push the earth outside of the

122
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:57,800
habitable zone. So the point here is that
there earth has worn many masks, right?

123
00:06:57,801 --> 00:06:58,970
And we need, you know, what,

124
00:06:58,971 --> 00:07:02,930
what's happening with us now is we're
changing the mask that the earth is about

125
00:07:02,931 --> 00:07:07,460
to wear. So we should get used
to this. Um, and it should
become part of our story.

126
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,200
Now, you know, the earth. So as I said,

127
00:07:09,201 --> 00:07:11,590
the earth has had worn many
masks because I love this a,

128
00:07:11,591 --> 00:07:14,810
a diagram that I'm a friend
of mine or a guy I know,

129
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:18,950
I knew drew just a beautiful
representation of all the
different eras and epochs

130
00:07:18,951 --> 00:07:21,380
and eons of the Earth's history.

131
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:24,500
And you see all of the different times
and the different kinds of animals.

132
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:27,990
But what's important is we're up
here in the whole scene, right? And,

133
00:07:27,991 --> 00:07:31,850
and each of these different
earths represents wildly
different conditions that

134
00:07:31,851 --> 00:07:34,220
the planet has passed through.
Okay.

135
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:38,360
But what we have been living in the last
10,000 years with geologically is not

136
00:07:38,361 --> 00:07:39,890
that long,
is the whole scene.

137
00:07:39,891 --> 00:07:44,810
And here's a record of temperature and
there's zero. This is variations from, uh,

138
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:47,230
from the current average.
And here's ice content. Well,

139
00:07:47,231 --> 00:07:50,240
you can see as the ice has been
going up and then down, up and down.

140
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:54,290
And these periods when the temperature
is sort of pokes above zero is these are

141
00:07:54,291 --> 00:07:56,380
interglacials.
So the whole scene,

142
00:07:56,390 --> 00:08:01,100
which is the entire history of human
civilization as just the latest,

143
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:05,480
uh, latest interglacial. So the
whole of human civilization,

144
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:10,540
while our history or our wars and hardship
and creativity has been in the whole

145
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:14,300
scene. But if you look at
the earth's history overall,

146
00:08:14,301 --> 00:08:17,300
and this is one of the revolutions I'm
going to talk about that we've undergone

147
00:08:17,301 --> 00:08:19,130
in the last 20 or 30 years,

148
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:22,610
that give us this new
perspective on what's happening
to us with climate change.

149
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:27,620
You see how dramatically life and it
has played a role in these transitions.

150
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:30,830
So what, here's another question.
These the only two, I promise,

151
00:08:30,831 --> 00:08:31,790
the only to test questions.

152
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:34,850
What would happen if you landed on the
earth about 3 billion years ago and

153
00:08:34,851 --> 00:08:37,400
walked out of your space ship?
What's the first thing that would happen?

154
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:41,420
You'd suffocate for it. Good.
Because you know what's amazing,

155
00:08:41,421 --> 00:08:43,700
even though the earth
had lots of life on it,

156
00:08:43,701 --> 00:08:45,590
lights had been on the
earth for a billion years.

157
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:49,700
There was no oxygen in the
atmosphere, right? The oxygen.
It was a, it was a pure,

158
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:53,960
almost a nitrogen co two
atmosphere. Um, and uh, the, um,

159
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:56,390
most of the,
uh,

160
00:08:56,520 --> 00:09:01,520
oxygen got put in place around 2.5 billion
years ago in what's called the great

161
00:09:01,621 --> 00:09:05,790
oxidation event. So this is a plot
of oxygen concentration versus time.

162
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:10,610
And you can see the oxygen content was a
million times less than it is today. Uh,

163
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:11,400
back then,

164
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:15,240
even though the earth we had was rich
with life and what created the great

165
00:09:15,241 --> 00:09:17,190
oxidation event, it was
blue, green bacteria.

166
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:21,420
There was the invention of a new kind
of photosynthesis that used water as a

167
00:09:21,421 --> 00:09:25,080
substrate and burped out or Fart it out
depending how you want to look at it,

168
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:26,580
a fart it out,
oxygen,

169
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:31,560
thereby changing the atmosphere of the
entire planet and changing the entire

170
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:36,630
evolutionary, um, uh,
history. The evolutionary
trajectory from that point on,

171
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:40,200
not just for life though, it
had huge consequences, right?

172
00:09:40,201 --> 00:09:43,320
You couldn't have big brains that like
we have without the energy that comes

173
00:09:43,321 --> 00:09:46,620
with oxygen metabolism,
but also for the planet itself.

174
00:09:46,621 --> 00:09:50,880
By having all this oxygen and completely
changed the chemical cycles that

175
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:54,900
regulated the planets. Uh, you know,
uh, um, uh, the planet's history,

176
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:58,620
for example,
it created ozone without an ozone layer.

177
00:09:58,621 --> 00:10:01,050
You could never do without ozone.

178
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:04,530
You would completely change the
dynamics of the surface from the life's

179
00:10:04,531 --> 00:10:08,880
perspective. Without ozone,
you could never have colonized
land. So it was, it was,

180
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:09,381
uh,
the,

181
00:10:09,381 --> 00:10:13,530
the step and the great oxygenation event
that actually allowed the land to be

182
00:10:13,531 --> 00:10:14,364
colonized.

183
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:18,420
So this is an example and it's something
very important for us now that life is

184
00:10:18,421 --> 00:10:23,130
constantly co evolving with the planet,
right?

185
00:10:23,131 --> 00:10:24,410
So this is a,
in this plot,

186
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:27,810
what we see is on this side is things
that have happened in Earth's history

187
00:10:27,811 --> 00:10:31,230
going back 4 billion years and things
that have happened in life's history.

188
00:10:31,231 --> 00:10:31,681
And you see,

189
00:10:31,681 --> 00:10:36,681
there's this constant feedback between
them where the development of a methane

190
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:41,850
eating bacteria will drive,
um, uh, uh, the great,

191
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:46,860
uh, uh, snowball, a snowball
phases of the earth's history.

192
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:51,180
Um, having oxygen allowed sex actually
to happen because it created a,

193
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:54,420
allowed you to organisms to figure
out, um, sexual reproduction.

194
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:58,380
So life and planets co evolve.

195
00:10:58,410 --> 00:11:02,130
That should be a lesson for
any life on any planet, right?

196
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:04,650
What we've seen is that the biosphere,
uh,

197
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:09,460
is an important actor in the history
of our planet and we should expect that

198
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:13,620
should be a, a, an important actor in
at least other, some other planets.

199
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:19,030
So this leads to what is called the Gaia
hypothesis, which has, is very, well,

200
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,720
it's controversial,
but let me tell you a little about it.

201
00:11:20,721 --> 00:11:25,470
It was proposed by James Lovelock in
1979 and the idea was that all living

202
00:11:25,471 --> 00:11:28,740
things on earth kind of
function as a super organism,

203
00:11:28,741 --> 00:11:33,330
that that creates some self
regulates the planet for, um,

204
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,550
the for life, right?
That basically, you know,

205
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:37,590
even though the sun is
increasing in temperature,

206
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:41,820
the feedback loops created by particularly
microorganisms will regulate the

207
00:11:41,821 --> 00:11:45,870
planet's temperature to keep it cool
even though the overall solar radiation

208
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:48,220
that's hitting your planet is going up.
Um,

209
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:51,960
and this was actually an incredibly
important idea here is, uh,

210
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:54,910
it was Lovelock and the famous
biologist Lynn Margulis,

211
00:11:54,911 --> 00:11:56,800
who got together and sort
of really built this.

212
00:11:57,130 --> 00:12:00,430
And it was a very controversial
idea when it was first proposed.

213
00:12:00,431 --> 00:12:04,000
And part of that, because it became
kind of a new age sort of, you know,

214
00:12:04,001 --> 00:12:08,110
there were guys in churches and they
were guiding, you know, a festivals.

215
00:12:08,111 --> 00:12:10,090
It became a very new age,
woo idea.

216
00:12:10,091 --> 00:12:12,790
And there was one reason why
scientists didn't like it though.

217
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:17,110
Well it's because of the idea
of teleology. It's somehow
seemed like an implied,

218
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:20,410
like the earth wanted to go somewhere
like the earth had a mind and it was

219
00:12:20,411 --> 00:12:23,440
trying to, you know, direct
itself for some purpose.

220
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:28,230
And of course we know that
evolution is blind, right?
But over time, both, you know,

221
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:31,630
Margulis and Lovelock, we're able to
show that there's no teleology here.

222
00:12:31,631 --> 00:12:33,610
These are,
this is still blind evolution,

223
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:35,860
but that these feedbacks do in fact work.

224
00:12:35,861 --> 00:12:39,610
And so what happened was people kind
of dropped the name Gaia and it became

225
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:43,090
earth systems science. We talk,
we now don't talk about Gaia.

226
00:12:43,091 --> 00:12:44,710
We've talked about the
couple of earth systems.

227
00:12:44,711 --> 00:12:48,990
And by that we mean the biosphere,
uh, the, uh, atmosphere,

228
00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:51,590
the hydrosphere, which is all
the water, the cryosphere,

229
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:54,730
which ends up playing a huge role,
all the ice and then the lithosphere.

230
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:59,050
So what we now understand is
that the earth is this very
strongly coupled system,

231
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:00,430
a couple of systems,

232
00:13:00,431 --> 00:13:04,640
they all interact and that life
is been driving a lot of this, uh,

233
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:06,670
evolution for quite a long time.

234
00:13:06,671 --> 00:13:10,900
So that was really the main result of
Gaya was to get scientists to understand

235
00:13:10,901 --> 00:13:14,410
that life is not some green scruffed
the sitting on the surface passively,

236
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:19,030
that it hijack the planet a long time ago.
And when we think astro biologically,

237
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:23,110
this is a key idea for us as we
go hunting for other biospheres.

238
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:24,760
So right now there's an
enormous amount of work,

239
00:13:24,761 --> 00:13:27,160
some of it going right on over at Mit,
um,

240
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:32,740
developing models of so biospheres and
they're using these kinds of ideas as the

241
00:13:32,741 --> 00:13:35,830
fundamental way we're going to
detect life on other planets.

242
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:38,740
We're going to look for
signatures of biospheres,

243
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:42,140
chemical signatures of biosphere
is, it's a very guy, an idea. Um,

244
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:46,800
and actually goes back to Lovelock in
1963 he actually proposed that idea. So,

245
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:50,770
so this leads us now to the Anthropocene,
right?

246
00:13:50,771 --> 00:13:52,600
So now we have some background here about,
you know,

247
00:13:52,601 --> 00:13:56,260
about life and coevolution and planets.
We come back to ourselves,

248
00:13:56,530 --> 00:14:00,520
which is our entry into the anthropocene.
So the idea of the Anthropocene,

249
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:05,440
it was first proposed by crucial and
Stromer in 2002 and they were thinking in

250
00:14:05,441 --> 00:14:08,110
terms of strata, they were
actually proposing that, you know,

251
00:14:08,111 --> 00:14:12,350
a million years from now you would be
able to see the earth's entry. You know,

252
00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:16,690
our, our presence by a layer of strata
that would have Kevin Cole or isotopic

253
00:14:16,691 --> 00:14:19,480
signatures of our presence.
But even more than that,

254
00:14:19,481 --> 00:14:23,740
it was the recognition that human
beings now are the, are the drivers,

255
00:14:23,741 --> 00:14:28,420
the principle drivers of changes in
those coupled planetary systems. Right?

256
00:14:28,421 --> 00:14:32,110
And this has now been verified in multiple
ways. Things like we can, you know,

257
00:14:32,111 --> 00:14:35,470
it's human beings who move around
most of the phosphorus on the planet.

258
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:39,700
Climate change is an obvious example.
Land colonization. There's many,

259
00:14:39,701 --> 00:14:43,930
many markers you can find to show that
really it's human beings that are driving

260
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:46,960
how this system behaves, which
means we're pushing it, right?

261
00:14:46,961 --> 00:14:49,450
So the climate or the,
those couple of systems,

262
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:53,300
it's nonlinear complex system right now
it's been sitting at the bottom of a

263
00:14:53,301 --> 00:14:56,000
well, right? You know, in
potential energy, so to speak.

264
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,690
And now we've been rocking it hard
enough over the last hundred and 50 years

265
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:02,920
that we're now, you know, it's starting
to roll off into some other states.

266
00:15:02,921 --> 00:15:07,310
So the Anthropocene is something
that is happening. Um, uh,

267
00:15:07,311 --> 00:15:11,990
and the question is what are its outcomes
and do its outcomes include us, right?

268
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:14,870
So the entry into the Anthropocene,
racist,

269
00:15:14,871 --> 00:15:18,060
profound new questions about the
nature of human activity, uh,

270
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:19,970
within the couple of planetary systems.

271
00:15:19,971 --> 00:15:23,750
And what I want to show is how by
taking this large, this 10,000 light,

272
00:15:23,751 --> 00:15:26,590
your view of this, we actually
gained a pretty powerful, uh,

273
00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:31,190
new way of talking about climate
change. One of these is, I just had an,

274
00:15:31,191 --> 00:15:34,400
an New York Times op Ed, uh, two days
ago about this is that, you know,

275
00:15:34,401 --> 00:15:37,190
this is not about saving the earth.
The earth is going to be just fine.

276
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:40,730
Thank you very much. Right? So this is,
this whole often gets framed as like, oh,

277
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:44,030
climate change, we have to
save the planet. Um, but I'd
say I like to say, you know,

278
00:15:44,031 --> 00:15:45,890
the planet is not a little furry bunny.

279
00:15:45,891 --> 00:15:49,790
That's one of the lessons
of understanding. Um, uh,
the earth history. You know,

280
00:15:49,791 --> 00:15:51,410
there are five known mass extinctions.

281
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:55,070
Each one opened up new
niches for species to evolve,

282
00:15:55,071 --> 00:15:58,790
including like this little critter here
who's, you know, your ancestor, right?

283
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:01,910
This was a mammo that was around during
the time of the dinosaurs and it was

284
00:16:01,911 --> 00:16:04,930
only the mass extinction
that allowed, you know, uh,

285
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:08,360
she and her progenitors to lead to us.
Okay.

286
00:16:08,361 --> 00:16:11,120
So even though we're driving
a mass extinction, you know,

287
00:16:11,121 --> 00:16:14,480
in terms of the longterm history
of the earth, the planet,

288
00:16:14,481 --> 00:16:18,650
we'll just use though
that for, um, uh, for a,

289
00:16:18,651 --> 00:16:23,390
for a new round of evolutionary
innovation. So when we
talk about sustainability,

290
00:16:23,391 --> 00:16:26,690
what we have to be very careful is to
understand what are we trying to sustain,

291
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:31,100
right on. What are the moral imperatives
that we invoke for doing so. So often.

292
00:16:31,101 --> 00:16:33,740
For example, you know, we show
these pictures of, you know,

293
00:16:33,810 --> 00:16:37,730
polar bears on lonely ice flows
to, you know, to, you know,

294
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:41,840
drive some guilt and some, you know,
and some action hopefully. But,

295
00:16:41,841 --> 00:16:45,080
but the idea is there, you know, when
we think about this is that, oh my God,

296
00:16:45,081 --> 00:16:47,900
we can't let the polar bears go extinct.
But on the other hand,

297
00:16:47,901 --> 00:16:52,550
who's crying for this guy? Right? You
know, the velociraptors were once around,

298
00:16:52,551 --> 00:16:56,450
you know, and they went extinct. Lots
of species have gone extinct. Okay. So,

299
00:16:56,510 --> 00:16:58,940
you know, we need to understand what
exactly were we trying to sustain.

300
00:16:58,941 --> 00:17:03,860
Is the polar bear for itself or is it
the sort of our framing inside the eco

301
00:17:03,861 --> 00:17:07,030
inside the biosphere? I need to, to
make something very clear. Right?

302
00:17:07,031 --> 00:17:08,850
Cause at this point, some people
will get really angry with me. Like,

303
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:11,660
we don't care about polar bears
do care about polar bears. Right?

304
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:15,260
But the polar bears get fit into this
larger question, which we're not asking.

305
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:19,760
So for sure climate change is an immediate
and possibly existential threat to

306
00:17:19,761 --> 00:17:21,080
the project of civilization.

307
00:17:21,350 --> 00:17:25,520
It is imperative that we act immediately
and you know, with, with some, uh,

308
00:17:25,521 --> 00:17:29,330
force in order to deal with it. So
nothing I'm saying here takes that away.

309
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:32,470
But the problem is,
one problem is why haven't we acted right?

310
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:37,070
W Y after a gears and Johnson brought
this up, why haven't we acted?

311
00:17:37,071 --> 00:17:40,910
And part of my argument here is that
we've had the story we've been telling us

312
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,550
has been able to be co-opted.
You know, the story,

313
00:17:43,551 --> 00:17:46,970
the main story we've been telling has
been co opted by climate deniers as a way

314
00:17:46,971 --> 00:17:51,020
of blunting, um, our activity.
So what are we trying to sustain,

315
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:54,870
sustain what we really are trying to
sustain, sustain, if we're being honest,

316
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:58,650
is the climactic conditions that
are amenable to a particular kind of

317
00:17:58,651 --> 00:18:03,480
civilization hours, right? It's
technological, it's energy intensive.

318
00:18:03,630 --> 00:18:05,370
It's got a pretty high population.
I mean,

319
00:18:05,371 --> 00:18:07,440
hopefully we can bring the
population slowly down,

320
00:18:07,441 --> 00:18:10,920
but unless somebody wants to volunteer,
you know, to off themselves, you know,

321
00:18:10,921 --> 00:18:12,840
it's going to have a high
population for a while.

322
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:16,860
And also what we want is
maximum human wellbeing.
Actually what we want, you know,

323
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:20,460
you can add to this maximum biospheric
wellbeing, including polar bears, right?

324
00:18:20,610 --> 00:18:23,220
But we have to understand that really
what we're trying to do is we're trying to

325
00:18:23,221 --> 00:18:27,720
hold some version of the whole scene,
right? We are, we are preferencing,

326
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:30,750
uh, preference, having prayer,

327
00:18:30,751 --> 00:18:33,510
great preference for the whole scene,
right?

328
00:18:33,511 --> 00:18:35,430
And we have to understand why
we're doing that. So, you know,

329
00:18:35,431 --> 00:18:37,580
we should be honest about why
we're doing that. And as the amp,

330
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:39,240
as the anthropocene goes on,

331
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:42,690
one of the things I'm saying is what
you're going to be holding is a version of

332
00:18:42,691 --> 00:18:43,261
the whole scene.

333
00:18:43,261 --> 00:18:47,190
It's not the Holocene anymore
because we're here and
we're going to have impacts.

334
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:52,590
Um, so by sustaining the
Holocene in perpetuity,

335
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:57,100
we take on the role of planetary stewards.
And what does that actually mean? Um,

336
00:18:57,270 --> 00:19:01,790
what does that make us? How do we fit
into nature? In particular, right? Um,

337
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:06,570
in some sense the view I'm advocating the,
uh, city is no different from a forest,

338
00:19:06,571 --> 00:19:08,430
from the biosphere's perspective,
right?

339
00:19:08,431 --> 00:19:12,060
We are what the biosphere
is doing right now. Okay.

340
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:16,830
So m and a particularly what is nature
in a planet that has a technological

341
00:19:16,831 --> 00:19:21,090
civilization on it, a large scale, energy
intensive technological civilization.

342
00:19:21,091 --> 00:19:24,660
What is nature, what, what
counts is nature anymore. Um,

343
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:28,410
so now I want to come to, you know, the,
this will be the second half of the talk,

344
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:30,540
the astrobiological perspective,

345
00:19:30,541 --> 00:19:33,720
how actually thinking
about planet generically,

346
00:19:33,721 --> 00:19:36,180
which is what we should be doing because
that's what we've learned over the last

347
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:39,540
20 or 30 years. Um, uh,
how does this change,

348
00:19:39,850 --> 00:19:42,090
how does this reframe everything
I've just been saying?

349
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:46,350
So astrobiology is a relatively new
fields about thinking about life and its

350
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:47,670
planetary context.

351
00:19:47,671 --> 00:19:51,510
It's about thinking about what's happened
here and what might happen elsewhere

352
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:56,190
in a deeply scientific and deeply, um, uh,

353
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:58,170
interdisciplinary kind of way.

354
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:00,110
Okay.

355
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:04,220
So there's been three revolutions that
have happened in astrobiology, um,

356
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:05,900
that we want to address.
And you know,

357
00:20:05,901 --> 00:20:09,440
so clearly astrobiology right now
has an n equals one problem, right?

358
00:20:09,441 --> 00:20:11,390
We only have one example of
life. And you can say like, well,

359
00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:14,150
how do you even have a field when
you only have one thing to study?

360
00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:16,310
The thing is though,
that if you take that point of view,

361
00:20:16,311 --> 00:20:19,100
you're missing some amazing
things that have happened, right?

362
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:22,750
So it's a very data rich field in
the sense of these three revolutions,

363
00:20:22,751 --> 00:20:24,230
the discovery of exoplanets,

364
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:28,460
the exploration of our own solar
system and the unpacking earth,

365
00:20:28,461 --> 00:20:32,360
4.5 billion year history. So very quickly,
let's sort of look with those are.

366
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:35,780
So number one, exoplanets. So
when I was a graduate student,

367
00:20:35,810 --> 00:20:39,740
there were no other planets in
the universe except our own right.

368
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:43,460
This question of exoplanets dates back,
you can see the Greeks arguing about it,

369
00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:47,350
right? So, um, uh, uh,
Aristotle felt that, uh,

370
00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:52,410
the earth was the only world of its kind
in the entire universe. Um, and, um, uh,

371
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:53,350
you know,
other Greek thinkers,

372
00:20:53,351 --> 00:20:57,310
the alchemists in particular were very
sure that the universe was full of

373
00:20:57,311 --> 00:20:58,810
planets and all those planets had life.

374
00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:02,050
You follow through history and you can
see sort of people switching back and

375
00:21:02,051 --> 00:21:03,580
forth.
By the 19 hundreds,

376
00:21:03,581 --> 00:21:06,670
it was thought that planets were very
rare because the way they thought planets

377
00:21:06,671 --> 00:21:07,504
would form is that the only,

378
00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:10,630
the only way you could get it was two
stars passing close to each other and

379
00:21:10,631 --> 00:21:14,170
getting gravitational IX, you know,
extrusion like Taffy. So those,

380
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:18,230
those collisions would be so rare that
it was thought that planets, you know,

381
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:20,910
one in a trillion stars would
have planets around it. And,

382
00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:25,840
and so this went on until 1995 we
discovered our first exoplanet. Right?

383
00:21:25,841 --> 00:21:26,980
And that was,
that was,

384
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:30,970
it's not often that you get to live at a
time when a 3000 year old question gets

385
00:21:30,971 --> 00:21:34,450
definitively answered. Since then,
something remarkable has happened,

386
00:21:34,451 --> 00:21:35,950
which is particularly the Kepler mission,

387
00:21:35,951 --> 00:21:38,230
which uses transits when you look for the,
uh,

388
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:40,990
the planet passing in front of the star.

389
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:44,620
So the light dims a little bit that
now suddenly we went from, you know,

390
00:21:44,621 --> 00:21:48,220
sort of a retail planet hunting
to wholesale planet hunting.

391
00:21:48,221 --> 00:21:51,760
And so now what we know
remarkably is that every star,

392
00:21:51,761 --> 00:21:56,761
pretty much every star you see in the
sky has a family of worlds around it.

393
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:58,270
I mean,
that is a remarkable,

394
00:21:58,271 --> 00:22:01,810
planets are everywhere other than
perhaps the most massive stars,

395
00:22:01,811 --> 00:22:04,930
which themselves are very rare.
Every star has planets.

396
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,630
And if you count up five stars,
one, two, three, four, five,

397
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:10,690
one of them is going to have a planet
in the right place for life to form.

398
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:13,750
It'll be what's called the habitable zone,
where liquid water can form.

399
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:15,490
And then we think water
is essential for life.

400
00:22:15,491 --> 00:22:20,380
So one out of every five is in the
right place for life to form. Okay.

401
00:22:20,381 --> 00:22:24,730
So that was one revolution.
The other revolution was,
you know, we've sent robots,

402
00:22:24,731 --> 00:22:26,080
robot emissaries,
now,

403
00:22:26,081 --> 00:22:29,830
robot ambassadors to pretty much every
kind of body in the solar system,

404
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:33,070
asteroids, comets. We visited
every planet in the solar system.

405
00:22:33,071 --> 00:22:36,810
We've had rovers rolling around,
you know, at least one of them. Um,

406
00:22:36,910 --> 00:22:39,310
but we'd had stuff's Tut that
touchdown a lot of others.

407
00:22:39,490 --> 00:22:41,320
And so we get pictures
like this, which, you know,

408
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:44,590
could be Mars or it could be the Mojave
desert. Turns out it's Mars, right?

409
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:45,930
But we've now, you know, we,

410
00:22:46,010 --> 00:22:50,020
this has been a decades now that we've
been rolling around on Mars and we've

411
00:22:50,021 --> 00:22:52,600
learned amazing things.
For example,

412
00:22:52,690 --> 00:22:55,650
we now know for sure that Mars
was a blue world, you know,

413
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:59,080
and the early part of the solar system,
Mars most likely looked like this. It was,

414
00:22:59,081 --> 00:23:02,980
had a much thicker atmosphere. It
had water, you know, you know, uh,

415
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:05,410
at least lakes if not oceans on it.

416
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:08,290
There's a strata that we can
see that you can estimate a,

417
00:23:08,291 --> 00:23:11,410
you can do the estimate to show that
water would probably hip deep was rushing

418
00:23:11,411 --> 00:23:16,180
it about three feet per second, um, uh,
across that channel. So it's remarkable.

419
00:23:16,181 --> 00:23:20,350
So it shows us, especially in dealing
with climate, is to show people that,

420
00:23:20,530 --> 00:23:23,740
you know, it's not like we just have the
earth to study when it comes to climate.

421
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:28,150
We have tested our climate models
against Mars, against venous,

422
00:23:28,151 --> 00:23:29,020
against Titan,

423
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:32,440
and those models all I can predict the
weather on Mars basically tomorrow with

424
00:23:32,441 --> 00:23:33,790
great accuracy,
right?

425
00:23:33,791 --> 00:23:36,880
So the idea that these climate models are
just kind of always something somebody

426
00:23:36,881 --> 00:23:39,490
made up, that's, you know,
it's just completely wrong.

427
00:23:39,491 --> 00:23:42,760
We know how climate works because
we've seen how climate work now,

428
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:46,070
the climate works now on, you know,
six different kinds of planets.

429
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:51,200
All very different. So, uh, our
study of the solar system has it,

430
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:53,810
that's what's taught us to think
like a planet, or at least gave us,

431
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:56,630
taught us how to think like
a planet without life, right?

432
00:23:56,660 --> 00:24:01,280
And then through the earth study, we're
able to think like a planet with life.

433
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:05,720
Um, what's also important is to show that,
you know, sustainability is just like,

434
00:24:05,721 --> 00:24:08,300
habitability is probably
going to be a moving target.

435
00:24:08,301 --> 00:24:10,700
We're going to have to learn to think
that way because the march used to be

436
00:24:10,701 --> 00:24:13,970
habitable, but it's certainly isn't
now except for maybe, you know,

437
00:24:13,971 --> 00:24:17,750
just very extreme of file
kinds of creatures. Okay.

438
00:24:17,751 --> 00:24:20,840
So that was revolution number two.
And then revolution number three,

439
00:24:20,841 --> 00:24:24,080
as I kind of already went through
is the unpacking of Earth's history,

440
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:26,810
the great oxidation event, the, um, uh,

441
00:24:26,811 --> 00:24:30,560
the thermal maxima that have occurred
when the planet was a jungle world,

442
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:31,940
the snowball earth.

443
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:34,630
We now really have seen that
earth is so many different habits,

444
00:24:34,690 --> 00:24:38,510
has been so many different planets that
in some sense it gives us all those

445
00:24:38,511 --> 00:24:39,111
different areas.

446
00:24:39,111 --> 00:24:42,980
It's almost like we've got nine different
planets with life to study by studying

447
00:24:42,981 --> 00:24:45,650
the Earth's history because they
were so different. So we're,

448
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:48,140
what does all this lead us? Well, um,

449
00:24:48,410 --> 00:24:50,900
by using the astrobiological perspective,

450
00:24:50,901 --> 00:24:54,710
we can think about the anthropocene and
a broader planet or broader context.

451
00:24:54,711 --> 00:24:57,230
And then this question comes up,
right? Which nobody ever asks.

452
00:24:57,380 --> 00:25:00,350
We all know that we have to build a
sustainable version of civilization,

453
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:02,420
but how do we know that's even possible,
right?

454
00:25:02,450 --> 00:25:05,540
How do we know that something the
universe does, the universe has,

455
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,820
makes black holes,
universe makes comments,

456
00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:10,550
universe makes interstellar
clouds of a gas?

457
00:25:10,730 --> 00:25:15,020
How do we know what makes longterm
sustainable versions of energy intensive

458
00:25:15,021 --> 00:25:16,520
civilizations,
right?

459
00:25:16,670 --> 00:25:20,570
Because it may be that there's just no
such thing like that in the universe.

460
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:25,420
So this, by framing it this way,
suddenly, you know, we get, uh,

461
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:28,310
we're going to ask the questions in
a very different way. But of course,

462
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:32,690
obviously it means taking exos
civilizations seriously, right?

463
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:37,370
And I'm using exos civilizations rather
than aliens for a particular reason,

464
00:25:37,790 --> 00:25:40,940
right? So now when I say this,
I'm not talking about detection.

465
00:25:40,970 --> 00:25:43,100
I'm not talking about going out
and finding them though. You know,

466
00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:44,540
that is definitely an interesting thing,

467
00:25:44,541 --> 00:25:48,570
particularly in the era that we're in
when we have all these new exoplanets. Um,

468
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:50,900
I'm not talking about the
details of their biology,

469
00:25:50,901 --> 00:25:54,950
whether they look like reptiles where
they have nine fingers on each hand,

470
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:58,790
you know, uh, what kind of sex they have.
That's just like, that's not a medium.

471
00:25:58,791 --> 00:25:59,031
There's no,

472
00:25:59,031 --> 00:26:02,820
I don't have any constraints
scientifically that
actually addressed that. Um,

473
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:06,470
and certainly not sociology or they
communist capitalist peace loving not,

474
00:26:06,471 --> 00:26:10,310
you know, there's just nothing I can
do there. What I can do, however,

475
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:14,650
is I can focus on the coevolution of
civilization and a couple and coupled

476
00:26:14,690 --> 00:26:16,400
planetary systems in a scientific way.

477
00:26:16,670 --> 00:26:21,500
I now know enough to run models of this
interaction and ask what the generic

478
00:26:21,501 --> 00:26:26,420
response of a planet is when it's got
an energy intensive civilization. Okay?

479
00:26:26,421 --> 00:26:28,010
And that's what I'm going to convince
them to show you a little bit of those

480
00:26:28,011 --> 00:26:29,240
results.
We've run those models,

481
00:26:29,390 --> 00:26:34,160
just actually publish them just a little
while ago. Right? But so, you know, my,

482
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:38,330
my emphasis here is it's really time to
start doing this because it matters for

483
00:26:38,331 --> 00:26:41,690
us. And that means it's time to take
[inaudible] civilization seriously.

484
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:44,200
And it's time to stop snickering about it,
right?

485
00:26:44,201 --> 00:26:48,020
Because anytime you try and bring up
aliens, it's always like, you know, uh,

486
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:50,070
and that was a long time in
the scientific community.

487
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:52,020
It's because of prosthetic foreheads,
right?

488
00:26:52,170 --> 00:26:55,410
The reasons we can't talk
about it's aliens seriously
is because we've had years

489
00:26:55,411 --> 00:26:59,010
of bad television science fiction where,
you know, everybody looks like us,

490
00:26:59,011 --> 00:27:01,710
but they've got maybe
antenna on us. So, you know,

491
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,690
we're in a different universe now,
right?

492
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:08,130
We recognize the civilization that we've
built is the kind of alien civilization

493
00:27:08,131 --> 00:27:11,250
we've always been dreaming of on a
certain level. Right? So, so, you know,

494
00:27:11,251 --> 00:27:15,510
we need now to get past the snicker
factor and ask because that's our own,

495
00:27:15,630 --> 00:27:19,470
it's related to our own, you know,
survival in some sense. Okay.

496
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:22,160
So what am I telling you now for
the next 10, 15 minutes is a,

497
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:25,950
we're going to head towards a
science of exos civilizations. Okay?

498
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:30,840
Theoretical studies that are relevant to
the anthropocene. So first of all, uh,

499
00:27:30,841 --> 00:27:32,930
we have to recognize when we
think about Ekso civilizations,

500
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:35,460
it's always been a battle between
optimists and pessimists, right?

501
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:37,200
If you look at the history of this field,

502
00:27:37,201 --> 00:27:40,020
and what I'm going to argue is that
it's not that that changes significantly

503
00:27:40,170 --> 00:27:44,100
with the new data. So I'm sure many of
you are familiar with the Drake equation,

504
00:27:44,101 --> 00:27:46,680
right?
So a long interesting history.

505
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:51,270
The Drake equation was basically a way
of figuring out how many civilizations

506
00:27:51,271 --> 00:27:53,490
exist right now that we
could communicate with.

507
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:57,270
And they did that by breaking up the
problem into a bunch of different pieces.

508
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:59,280
The number of stars in the galaxy,

509
00:27:59,430 --> 00:28:02,220
the number of the fraction of
those stars that have planets,

510
00:28:02,370 --> 00:28:05,470
the number of those planets
in the palatable zone, um,

511
00:28:05,490 --> 00:28:07,650
the fraction of those
planets that form life,

512
00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:09,900
the fraction of that life
that goes on to intelligence,

513
00:28:09,901 --> 00:28:13,200
the fraction of that intelligence
that develops technology. And finally,

514
00:28:13,201 --> 00:28:17,040
as I like to call it, the final
factor, bump, bump, bump, boom,

515
00:28:17,370 --> 00:28:20,460
the average lifetime. That's actually
the thing we're really interested in.

516
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:24,130
What is the average lifetime of a
civilization like ours? Okay. So, um,

517
00:28:24,150 --> 00:28:25,320
I won't go into this in detail,

518
00:28:25,321 --> 00:28:28,470
but in a paper that we did
in a couple of years ago, um,

519
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:31,080
woody Sullivan and I use the Kepler data,
right?

520
00:28:31,081 --> 00:28:32,460
We've got all this data about planets now,

521
00:28:32,461 --> 00:28:35,910
which we didn't have before and we
used it to sort of figure out, well,

522
00:28:35,911 --> 00:28:40,440
what can you say about exos civilizations
empirically based on all this new data?

523
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:43,140
And what we found is that if
you asked the right question,

524
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:47,190
you could say something pretty
remarkable. Um, so here's what we could,

525
00:28:47,191 --> 00:28:50,550
we define something we
called the pessimism line
and it answers the following

526
00:28:50,551 --> 00:28:51,240
question.

527
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:56,190
What does the probability
for a civilization evolving
on a random planet have to

528
00:28:56,191 --> 00:28:59,400
be for humanity,
be the only time it's ever happened.

529
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:03,660
What's the limit on that probability
from this new data that we've gotten a so

530
00:29:03,661 --> 00:29:06,780
that we're the only time that civilization
has ever happened and we can do this

531
00:29:06,781 --> 00:29:11,340
now. We can set an empirical limit on this
because we now know if I go back right

532
00:29:11,341 --> 00:29:14,310
when Drake did his,
when Drake wrote down this equation,

533
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:19,200
that was the only term that was known. Now
these two terms have been nailed. Okay?

534
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:23,370
So that's a pretty large increase in your
understanding. Uh, for this equation,

535
00:29:23,371 --> 00:29:24,450
it's only seven terms in it.

536
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:29,730
So it turns out the prop for us to be
the only time in cosmic history that is

537
00:29:29,731 --> 00:29:30,840
civilization has arisen.

538
00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:35,850
The probability would have to be
10 to the minus 22 or lower right?

539
00:29:36,090 --> 00:29:37,950
One in 10 billion trillion.

540
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:42,100
If the probability for forming a
civilization on a planet, and you know,

541
00:29:42,101 --> 00:29:44,290
nature's is going to set this right
through its evolutionary process,

542
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:47,580
if it's any larger than this
number, it's happened before. Okay?

543
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:49,420
That's a pretty small number.
Okay.

544
00:29:49,450 --> 00:29:53,320
You don't have to work very hard in order
to get higher than one in 10 billion

545
00:29:53,321 --> 00:29:55,540
trillion as if as long
as it's bigger than that,

546
00:29:55,630 --> 00:30:00,060
we're not the first time there's been a
technological civilization. Okay? So, uh,

547
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:00,720
what that means.

548
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:04,120
So if you look at like famous pessimists
and time Ernst Mayer or Brandon Carter,

549
00:30:04,121 --> 00:30:06,250
I won't go through this. These
are people who were like, no,

550
00:30:06,251 --> 00:30:08,950
civilizations are really hard to make.
They never happen. They're really rare.

551
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:12,700
There are numbers are so much larger than
that pessimism line that there's been

552
00:30:12,701 --> 00:30:17,110
tens of millions or trillions of
civilizations over cosmic space and time.

553
00:30:17,410 --> 00:30:18,820
And the reason why it
was important to do this,

554
00:30:18,821 --> 00:30:23,110
it was because what we really asking
is if you had a statistical ensemble of

555
00:30:23,111 --> 00:30:25,870
alien civilizations, what
would their history be? Right?

556
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:28,150
They're all going to go through
what we're going through.

557
00:30:28,151 --> 00:30:29,400
That's part of the argument is that you,

558
00:30:29,401 --> 00:30:33,610
it's hard not to trigger an anthropocene
because a civilization is just a way of

559
00:30:33,670 --> 00:30:37,030
taking energy, harvesting energy
from your planet and doing work.

560
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:39,970
Second Law of thermodynamics is kind of
gun to demand that you have some kind of

561
00:30:39,971 --> 00:30:42,220
feedback. So, um, uh, you know,

562
00:30:42,221 --> 00:30:45,560
with this work shows is that
it's really not hard. You know,

563
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:49,050
you don't have to work very hard in terms
of the probabilities to be end to end,

564
00:30:49,330 --> 00:30:52,480
to end up with the conclusion that
there's been lots of histories. And so,

565
00:30:52,481 --> 00:30:56,480
you know, doing thinking statistically
about, uh, anthropocenes, um,

566
00:30:56,500 --> 00:31:00,730
is not a bad idea. So the Anthropocene,
it's happened before probably, right?

567
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:02,860
Which is a remarkable thing.
So that's what this idea that like,

568
00:31:03,010 --> 00:31:04,660
we look at what's happening
with earth and you know,

569
00:31:04,661 --> 00:31:05,920
we have this huge political debate.

570
00:31:05,921 --> 00:31:09,550
Everybody's freaking out because it's
as if like, we're a teenager who do,

571
00:31:09,551 --> 00:31:12,700
you know, going through our emotional
stuff and we kind of feel like, you know,

572
00:31:12,701 --> 00:31:14,760
nobody's ever gone through this
before. And then they talk, yeah,

573
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:17,050
they get to an encounter
group or something and they
talk to others and realize

574
00:31:17,051 --> 00:31:21,430
like, oh, everybody's gone through
this before. So by modeling this,

575
00:31:21,610 --> 00:31:22,780
what can we figure out?

576
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:26,860
So the claim is we know enough about
planets and how they respond to forcing

577
00:31:26,861 --> 00:31:27,520
meaning,
you know,

578
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:32,050
sermon dynamic driving to begin modeling
how any species will drive feedbacks on

579
00:31:32,051 --> 00:31:34,780
their planet through energy
harvesting and civilization building.

580
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:38,650
So this is what I call a time with
tongue held politely and cheek,

581
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:42,730
the theoretical archeology
of Xo civilizations. Um,

582
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:46,550
so how do we do this?
Well,

583
00:31:46,551 --> 00:31:48,610
but we're going to do is we're going
to do dynamical systems modeling.

584
00:31:48,630 --> 00:31:52,520
We're going to set up equations for
a population interacting with its

585
00:31:52,521 --> 00:31:55,940
environment. And this is a time
honored process in population biology.

586
00:31:55,941 --> 00:31:59,480
Going all the way back to the Predator
prey model where you basically have an

587
00:31:59,481 --> 00:32:02,710
equation for the bunnies and equation for
the wolves. And they're coupled, right?

588
00:32:02,711 --> 00:32:05,770
Cause the, when the wolves eat the
bunnies, they get more wolf babies. Um,

589
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:08,210
but the more too many wolf babies
and there's no bunnies left to eat.

590
00:32:08,390 --> 00:32:10,400
So you know, you can write down
these equations, solve them,

591
00:32:10,401 --> 00:32:14,630
and you find these a oscillations, these,
uh, that are out of phase beautifully.

592
00:32:14,990 --> 00:32:18,800
You know, the data really matched this
really well. So population biology,

593
00:32:18,801 --> 00:32:22,010
you don't have to assume a lot about
population biology other than, you know,

594
00:32:22,011 --> 00:32:23,960
you eat more resources, you
get more babies. That's,

595
00:32:23,961 --> 00:32:25,790
that's the only assumption
I'm making in this,

596
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,700
these stimuli or the models that we're
making. And maybe you can say, okay,

597
00:32:28,701 --> 00:32:31,340
well maybe on a life on another
planet doesn't do that. But you know,

598
00:32:31,341 --> 00:32:34,850
that seems kind of fundamental
to what we think of as life.

599
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:37,330
Okay.

600
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:39,590
Um, so, you know, uh, when
we thought doing this,

601
00:32:39,591 --> 00:32:43,790
what we imagined is we'd have some phase
space of planetary parameters, right?

602
00:32:43,791 --> 00:32:47,870
Like energy consumption,
population feedback on the planet.

603
00:32:48,050 --> 00:32:50,120
And what we imagine is when we run,
ran the models,

604
00:32:50,121 --> 00:32:52,200
we'd get different kinds of a solution.

605
00:32:52,201 --> 00:32:55,910
So like you could imagine you start off
with a very low population and you're

606
00:32:55,911 --> 00:32:59,180
not using a lot of energy per person.
And what happens is as time goes on,

607
00:32:59,181 --> 00:33:00,500
your technology increases,

608
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:03,740
you start using more energy in your
population goes up, you make more babies,

609
00:33:03,950 --> 00:33:06,290
but eventually at some point
you're using so much energy,

610
00:33:06,291 --> 00:33:08,480
you're feeding back on
the planet and your,

611
00:33:08,481 --> 00:33:10,890
the trajectory of your
population will end up, you know,

612
00:33:10,970 --> 00:33:15,050
heading in this direction and it gets
too large. And perhaps, you know,

613
00:33:15,051 --> 00:33:18,440
the planet responds, you start having
instabilities, wild climate changes,

614
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:20,930
and then your population would,
you know, come way back down.

615
00:33:20,930 --> 00:33:23,210
You basically collapse, right?
That's a collapsed trajectory.

616
00:33:23,510 --> 00:33:25,230
Or You could have a
sustainability instructor.

617
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:28,550
We figure out how to deal with this and
you end up with some nice steady state

618
00:33:28,551 --> 00:33:32,600
where your population is, is stable and
the or feedback on the planet is stable.

619
00:33:32,601 --> 00:33:35,090
So this is what we were looking
to do when we built our models.

620
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:38,150
And it's very interesting to look
at the earth right now. This is the,

621
00:33:38,151 --> 00:33:42,230
a world energy consumption
from 10,000 BC to now. Uh,

622
00:33:42,231 --> 00:33:45,620
so that's our energy per capita.
This is co two concentration,

623
00:33:45,621 --> 00:33:49,130
which is the planetary forcing and this
is global population. So those are those,

624
00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:53,210
uh, those three things,
those three parameters for
the earth. And you see that,

625
00:33:53,211 --> 00:33:54,650
yeah. Like we're, you know,

626
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:58,700
we're pretty much on a trajectory
for something enormous increase,

627
00:33:58,701 --> 00:34:01,330
exponential increase in world population,
uh,

628
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:04,280
energy use and the feedback on the planet.

629
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:09,110
So what happens next generically?
So what we did is, you know,

630
00:34:09,111 --> 00:34:11,960
these models, actually the paper
just came out recently. Um,

631
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:14,660
I won't go into the equations that we
use. These were actually, you know,

632
00:34:14,661 --> 00:34:16,850
these were, as you guys all
understand, a toy model, right?

633
00:34:16,851 --> 00:34:21,200
We tried to capture the essential of the
interaction between a population using

634
00:34:21,201 --> 00:34:23,600
a planetary resource,
making more babies,

635
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:27,560
but having that planetary
resource feedback on the
state of the planet so that

636
00:34:27,590 --> 00:34:31,940
you end up, you know, the planet drifts
away from where it was when you were born.

637
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,810
Okay. As a civilization. So here's
what the solutions look like.

638
00:34:35,811 --> 00:34:38,000
So in these plots,
um,

639
00:34:38,030 --> 00:34:42,170
green is the population of the
civilization and red you can think of is

640
00:34:42,171 --> 00:34:44,780
planetary temperature.
And what we found broadly,

641
00:34:44,781 --> 00:34:49,760
even in these simple models were
three classes of, of, um, of,

642
00:34:49,790 --> 00:34:53,660
uh, trajectory. First was
what we call die off, right?

643
00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:56,510
So here you see the die off
the population. You know,

644
00:34:56,511 --> 00:35:01,230
a population rises very quickly because
it's consuming the planet's resource. Um,

645
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:05,990
the, the planet heats up the planet
to conditions on a plan to change. Um,

646
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:10,340
but, uh, so then the p the population
overshoots the planet's carrying capacity,

647
00:35:10,341 --> 00:35:13,490
how many of that organism
the planet can sustain.

648
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:16,590
And then you get a big
drop in the number of, uh,

649
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:19,370
the population until you come to
some kind of Nice steady state,

650
00:35:19,670 --> 00:35:22,130
but you do it at some cost so you
can lose weight in our models,

651
00:35:22,131 --> 00:35:25,940
up to 70% of your population.
So imagine that everybody you knew,

652
00:35:25,970 --> 00:35:29,720
seven out of every 10 people you knew,
uh, disappeared because of, uh, you know,

653
00:35:29,810 --> 00:35:31,670
climate related disasters.
Um,

654
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:34,970
so it's not clear that a
civilization could survive
that. Maybe it could, but, um,

655
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:35,541
but at least,
you know,

656
00:35:35,541 --> 00:35:37,500
the good news here was he did
get a steady state in the end.

657
00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:40,890
There was also what we call the
sustainable or soft landing.

658
00:35:40,891 --> 00:35:42,060
That was the really good news.
Yeah,

659
00:35:42,061 --> 00:35:45,450
there's definitely solutions where you
change the planet, the, you know, read,

660
00:35:45,451 --> 00:35:48,840
the temperature goes up, your population
goes up and your energy use goes up,

661
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:52,620
but you come to some steady state. So the
model's admitted that kind of solution.

662
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:57,570
But there was also the possibility of the,
of the collapse and there's, you know,

663
00:35:57,600 --> 00:36:01,110
there's enough in there to be a
worrisome where the population rises,

664
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:02,970
the planet goes into a runaway,

665
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:06,810
essentially just like Venus went into a
runaway with a runaway greenhouse effect.

666
00:36:06,811 --> 00:36:09,660
Why Venus is temperature
is now 800 degrees. Um,

667
00:36:09,690 --> 00:36:10,830
so this is a different kind of runaway,

668
00:36:10,831 --> 00:36:14,010
but at the same basic idea and your
population comes all the way down to

669
00:36:14,011 --> 00:36:16,110
extinction. Now, whether or
not you actually are extinct,

670
00:36:16,111 --> 00:36:19,170
what really matters is you can't maintain
your technological highly coupled,

671
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:21,980
you know,
networked civilization anymore.

672
00:36:21,990 --> 00:36:24,930
So that's in some sense would
collapse means you also, interesting,

673
00:36:24,931 --> 00:36:26,910
we found these oscillations
as well in there.

674
00:36:26,911 --> 00:36:31,380
If you don't have the population rises
and falls and rises and falls. Um, so,

675
00:36:31,381 --> 00:36:33,150
but either way.
So these were simple models,

676
00:36:33,151 --> 00:36:38,151
but they gave us a hint that there
are generic classes of behavior in the

677
00:36:38,281 --> 00:36:41,880
models. Okay? So this leads
us to, you know, eventually.

678
00:36:41,881 --> 00:36:44,340
So this was a first cut at this.
What the next step is,

679
00:36:44,341 --> 00:36:45,930
we're going to build
in real climate models,

680
00:36:45,931 --> 00:36:49,440
we're going to build in the response of
different kinds of energy sources, right?

681
00:36:49,590 --> 00:36:52,020
There's only going to be so
many kinds of energy sources.

682
00:36:52,021 --> 00:36:54,900
A planet gives a young civilization,
you're going to have combustion,

683
00:36:54,901 --> 00:36:59,040
maybe not fossil fuels, but if there's bio
mass, you can burn it, um, wind, solar,

684
00:36:59,041 --> 00:37:03,970
etc. So we can build that into these and
really have, you know, much more, uh, uh,

685
00:37:04,330 --> 00:37:06,780
uh,
physically accurate kinds of models.

686
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:09,660
And then we can run it for all kinds of
planets, planets that are close to there,

687
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:12,660
the inner edge of the habitable zone,
planets that are further out,

688
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:17,070
planets with that start with oxygen,
planets that start with less oxygen. Uh,

689
00:37:17,410 --> 00:37:19,860
we can do all different kinds of things.
And from that,

690
00:37:19,861 --> 00:37:23,010
what we're going to get is a predict
and we're going to make a prediction for

691
00:37:23,011 --> 00:37:24,450
this average lifetime.

692
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:28,050
Now this really matters for us because
if the average lifetime of a civilization

693
00:37:28,051 --> 00:37:31,020
is 200 years, we're hosed. Right?

694
00:37:31,170 --> 00:37:33,690
Because what it means is
there's very little wiggle room.

695
00:37:33,990 --> 00:37:37,740
You don't have a lot of leeway in the
bets you make as you try and navigate your

696
00:37:37,741 --> 00:37:42,270
anthropocene. Almost nobody makes it,
right? On the other hand, if you're,

697
00:37:42,290 --> 00:37:46,770
um, uh, tie, if your average
lifetime is 2 million years, yeah,

698
00:37:46,771 --> 00:37:48,380
then you can make mistakes.
There's a lot of, you know,

699
00:37:48,381 --> 00:37:52,200
you could experiment and still make it
through lots of civilizations managed to

700
00:37:52,201 --> 00:37:54,190
make it through their
anthropocenes. So, you know,

701
00:37:54,210 --> 00:37:57,030
this is the thing that we're headed
towards seeing and this itself sort of

702
00:37:57,031 --> 00:38:01,650
frames what's happening to us now in
this, the sense that we are, you know,

703
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:06,060
one species out of many species that
have gone through this and, and you know,

704
00:38:06,061 --> 00:38:10,380
we sort of need to think more broadly
about what are our choices in that case.

705
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:14,130
Okay. So more to the point
then we're almost done here.

706
00:38:14,370 --> 00:38:16,410
The astrobiological perspective,

707
00:38:16,411 --> 00:38:19,980
what it tells us that energy harvesting
species and their civilizations are

708
00:38:19,981 --> 00:38:23,220
simply are simply something
that planets do. Okay.

709
00:38:23,221 --> 00:38:27,930
We can't keep thinking of ourselves as
somehow special or unique. Um, we are,

710
00:38:27,990 --> 00:38:31,630
uh, what the biosphere
is doing now, right? Um,

711
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:34,110
the biosphere are camp runs experiments,

712
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:37,750
planets with biospheres runs experiate
run experiments over and over again.

713
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:40,770
And we are simply one of
those right humans and then,

714
00:38:40,810 --> 00:38:44,350
and are human beings and our civilization,
we're just part of nature. You know,

715
00:38:44,351 --> 00:38:46,900
the, the biosphere has done
lots of interesting things.

716
00:38:47,050 --> 00:38:50,860
It did invented grasslands. That was
a new idea at one point. Right? Um,

717
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:53,080
and then the grassland
spread across the planet,

718
00:38:53,081 --> 00:38:55,870
change the planet's functioning
and invented dinosaurs.

719
00:38:55,871 --> 00:38:57,850
It invented bluegreen bacteria.

720
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,910
We are just with the biosphere has
invented and is playing with now.

721
00:39:00,911 --> 00:39:04,870
And there's no reason to think that we're
going to be what, um, uh, happens later.

722
00:39:04,871 --> 00:39:07,030
So we're an expression of the planet now,

723
00:39:07,090 --> 00:39:11,680
but do we continue to be an expression
of the planet? So one of these things,

724
00:39:11,681 --> 00:39:12,850
right?
So this is very controversial.

725
00:39:12,851 --> 00:39:15,460
I can get people really get
pissed off at me for this. Um,

726
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:18,880
what this means is climate
change is not our fault.

727
00:39:18,881 --> 00:39:22,570
One of the things I want to push us away
from is this narrative we have of that

728
00:39:22,571 --> 00:39:25,720
human beings are a plague on
the planet. We suck, right?

729
00:39:25,810 --> 00:39:29,080
When it comes to climate change, we
don't have many stories, right? Many,

730
00:39:29,081 --> 00:39:32,020
many sort of species wide,
planetary wide stories about ourselves.

731
00:39:32,021 --> 00:39:34,510
Because as I said,
it's a new transition.

732
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:37,870
And the only story we have either
is it's not happening at all,

733
00:39:37,871 --> 00:39:42,190
which is what you get from the climate
denialist or were terrible, were horrible,

734
00:39:42,191 --> 00:39:43,720
were a virus on the planet.

735
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:46,990
And what I'm pointing out
here is that that's not true.

736
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:49,600
So what do I mean by this?
Before anybody gets really angry with me,

737
00:39:49,930 --> 00:39:51,730
what I mean is that,
you know,

738
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:56,350
civilization since its beginning has
done what it has always looked for.

739
00:39:56,351 --> 00:40:00,760
Energy sources that it can
power. It's, you know, buildings,
right? It's irrigation.

740
00:40:00,790 --> 00:40:04,840
And we've been doing this since the end
of the, uh, the, the whole scene, right?

741
00:40:04,870 --> 00:40:08,090
So when we found oil, it
wasn't like we were like, ah,

742
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:10,780
I was destroying the planet with
this substance. It was like, Oh,

743
00:40:10,781 --> 00:40:13,720
this is brown guru and it's awesome.
You can heat your home,

744
00:40:13,721 --> 00:40:16,930
you can build internal combustion engines.
It was great stuff.

745
00:40:16,990 --> 00:40:19,420
We didn't know we were going to
trigger climate, right? It was,

746
00:40:19,421 --> 00:40:23,890
it was an unintended consequence of the
adoption of a particular energy modality.

747
00:40:24,070 --> 00:40:26,740
Right? Um, but now that we know,

748
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:29,350
if we don't do anything right now,

749
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:32,530
not doing anything about it would be
our fault. It would be our failure.

750
00:40:32,531 --> 00:40:33,780
It would be our folly.
You,

751
00:40:33,781 --> 00:40:37,870
it'll be why we end up in the garbage
heap of civilizations that couldn't manage

752
00:40:37,871 --> 00:40:41,930
their transition to maturity.
Okay. So you know, it,

753
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:45,020
this doesn't absolve us
of the responsibility of
doing something about it,

754
00:40:45,030 --> 00:40:46,270
given how important it is.

755
00:40:47,110 --> 00:40:49,960
So what I'm trying to do here really
is change the narrative, right?

756
00:40:50,170 --> 00:40:53,170
The anthropocene is not a
story of inherent human greed.

757
00:40:53,350 --> 00:40:56,980
It is not a story of our unworthiness
on the planet and the plan is trying to

758
00:40:56,981 --> 00:40:58,300
get rid of us.
In some sense.

759
00:40:58,540 --> 00:41:02,230
It's a snotty story of us as being
a plague on the planet. Instead,

760
00:41:02,231 --> 00:41:07,090
the Anthropocene is a story and that
we're just waking up to about planets and

761
00:41:07,091 --> 00:41:08,590
their experiments,
right?

762
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:13,620
We didn't know about earth 4.5 billion
year history of life and coevolution

763
00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:17,650
until very recently.
That is a new story for humanity.

764
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:21,100
And now we have to recognize
is how we fit into this, right?

765
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:26,280
Both because it's true and also it's the
story we need to understand to make it

766
00:41:26,621 --> 00:41:30,820
through the, what were the climate
change we've triggered. So for me,

767
00:41:30,850 --> 00:41:33,830
the true at lesson, so childhood
end, any science fans, right?

768
00:41:33,831 --> 00:41:36,110
One of the great science fiction books,
uh,

769
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:40,490
the true lessons of the anthropocene are
that planets have rules and we need to

770
00:41:40,491 --> 00:41:42,800
learn them, right? Planets
are machines, right?

771
00:41:43,090 --> 00:41:48,090
And we need to understand
how they function in order
to re to put ourselves back

772
00:41:48,471 --> 00:41:49,430
into them,
right?

773
00:41:49,790 --> 00:41:53,990
Sustainability is really in some sense
and awakened planet in which both the

774
00:41:53,991 --> 00:41:58,280
biosphere and the civilization
can flourish in entirely new ways.

775
00:41:58,340 --> 00:42:00,950
There's a paper we wrote recently
where we looked at what would be the

776
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:05,000
thermodynamic properties of a planet
with a large scale civilization on it.

777
00:42:05,210 --> 00:42:07,970
And the conclusions we came to,
there's gotta be some kind of cooperative,

778
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:09,590
you know,
relationship where we,

779
00:42:09,591 --> 00:42:13,430
the civilization makes the biosphere even
more productive, not just for itself,

780
00:42:13,431 --> 00:42:16,370
but for, you know, uh, you know,
not for the civilizations in,

781
00:42:16,490 --> 00:42:20,300
but for the biosphere
is end. Um, it's really,

782
00:42:20,301 --> 00:42:21,720
and this is about the
adoption of what you know,

783
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:26,060
has been called deep ecological values
were compassion and the identification

784
00:42:26,061 --> 00:42:28,310
with life because we were
part of the biosphere.

785
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:31,190
We're not above it is a
kind of primary value. Okay.

786
00:42:31,430 --> 00:42:34,160
And this is what's interesting for me.
It's actually the completion of Gaia,

787
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:35,660
right? Remember when I
talked about, you know,

788
00:42:35,661 --> 00:42:39,050
one of the big scientific pushbacks
on the Gaia hypothesis was that it was

789
00:42:39,051 --> 00:42:41,660
teleological. It had meaning
it had a direction, right?

790
00:42:41,810 --> 00:42:46,340
And we know that evolution is blind. It's
blind until something like us shows up.

791
00:42:46,370 --> 00:42:51,160
Once you get a technological civilization,
you're no longer blind, right? Uh,

792
00:42:51,170 --> 00:42:52,580
the evolution is no longer blind.

793
00:42:52,610 --> 00:42:56,450
We bring meaning we
bring direction to now,

794
00:42:56,451 --> 00:42:57,620
to the evolution of the planet.

795
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:00,320
So this is idea that goes
way back of the know sphere.

796
00:43:00,321 --> 00:43:02,360
I don't know if anybody's
ever heard of this. So, um,

797
00:43:02,361 --> 00:43:04,880
there were two versions of
this, uh, Teilhard de Chardin,

798
00:43:04,881 --> 00:43:08,810
which was a little bit more mystical. He
was, uh, uh, a scientist and a Jesuit, uh,

799
00:43:08,811 --> 00:43:11,110
as well. Um, and he sort of thought
of it as the word, you know,

800
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:15,260
the world being in shrouded in
thought or in the world soul.

801
00:43:15,380 --> 00:43:20,380
But there's also a verb Dansky Vladimir
for Dansky the great geochemists idea,

802
00:43:20,510 --> 00:43:24,770
which was more like, yeah, the, you know,
once thought appears on the planet now,

803
00:43:24,771 --> 00:43:26,930
just like there's a biosphere,
there's going to be, you know,

804
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:29,880
a sphere of thought around it. And, um,

805
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:32,630
the interesting thing was
shard Dan's version of this,

806
00:43:32,631 --> 00:43:36,680
of the world being covered in thought,
what the more mystical one was,

807
00:43:36,681 --> 00:43:39,830
the one that most people know about.
But of course, what happened is by then,

808
00:43:39,831 --> 00:43:41,450
you know, if this is the great
place to talk about this,

809
00:43:42,380 --> 00:43:45,500
we ended up building a no
sphere, right? I mean by mistake,

810
00:43:45,501 --> 00:43:47,510
we didn't know we were going to
make a note of here, but like, yeah,

811
00:43:47,511 --> 00:43:52,040
right now this room is
full of electromagnetic
radiations carrying thought,

812
00:43:52,460 --> 00:43:55,490
right? I mean, everybody's cell phone
is picking up on the know sphere.

813
00:43:55,670 --> 00:43:57,610
So you know, the idea of, um,

814
00:43:57,830 --> 00:44:02,090
there being a directionality to the
biosphere is evolution. Once, you know,

815
00:44:02,091 --> 00:44:06,100
a technological civilization shows
up, um, may actually be, you know,

816
00:44:06,110 --> 00:44:08,600
now that the world is covered in the know
sphere, right? So this is, these are the,

817
00:44:08,660 --> 00:44:10,200
you know, Internet links, um,

818
00:44:10,370 --> 00:44:14,750
across the planet that may actually be a
natural part of the evolution. So, okay.

819
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:18,560
So with all of this, for me actually
leads, it's a story of hope, right?

820
00:44:18,561 --> 00:44:22,800
So I did an Atlantic story about those
that, that, that study of, um, the,

821
00:44:22,810 --> 00:44:26,210
the study we did of the different
possibilities of interaction between the

822
00:44:26,211 --> 00:44:30,180
planet and it's a, at a planet and a
civilization, right? And all of a sudden,

823
00:44:30,181 --> 00:44:33,090
I didn't Atlantic story on it and it got
picked up and everybody was focusing on

824
00:44:33,091 --> 00:44:37,050
all the trajectories that led to death
and disaster. And I had to be like, Whoa,

825
00:44:37,051 --> 00:44:39,330
wait a minute. One of the
trajectories with sustainability.

826
00:44:39,331 --> 00:44:42,240
So like even though simple models
point after the fact, like, yeah,

827
00:44:42,241 --> 00:44:46,200
you can do this, you know, I mean from
that simple perspective, you know,

828
00:44:46,201 --> 00:44:49,530
if the question is, is sustainability
possible, the answer is yes,

829
00:44:49,770 --> 00:44:50,940
it may be hard to achieve,

830
00:44:50,941 --> 00:44:55,310
but at least it exists according to those
very simple models. Right. So the uh,

831
00:44:55,320 --> 00:45:00,300
so I'm hopeful, you know,
so in its context, the, um,
the, in the cosmic context,

832
00:45:00,301 --> 00:45:02,530
in some sense the
Anthropocene doesn't happen.

833
00:45:02,540 --> 00:45:04,320
It's not a story with villains in it.
Right.

834
00:45:04,321 --> 00:45:09,321
As much as I am very angry at the
people who promote climate denial,

835
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:11,310
they're not villains,
they're folly.

836
00:45:11,340 --> 00:45:16,340
They are the agent of our folly that
will lead us to not reaching our own

837
00:45:16,471 --> 00:45:20,730
potential. Okay. But from the biosphere's
perspective, you know, there's,

838
00:45:20,850 --> 00:45:22,140
there's planets have histories,

839
00:45:22,141 --> 00:45:25,050
they have trajectories and hopefully
you can manage to get yourself on a good

840
00:45:25,051 --> 00:45:29,280
one. Oh. And vote out the people
who are keeping you holding back.

841
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:32,010
So it's a story about winners and losers
and re essentially what I want to say

842
00:45:32,011 --> 00:45:35,430
is that we are cosmic teenagers and
that we need to grow up. So, you know,

843
00:45:35,431 --> 00:45:38,820
I think someone has done it. So why
can't we, and I'll end with this.

844
00:45:38,821 --> 00:45:41,710
This is a picture of Bill Nye came
to the University of Rochester. Um,

845
00:45:41,750 --> 00:45:44,860
and he gave a talk and I was amazed.
I mean, I, you know, I grew up,

846
00:45:44,870 --> 00:45:48,060
I knew bill Nye when I was a graduate
student, you know, even in Seattle,

847
00:45:48,270 --> 00:45:51,090
but I didn't realize like
the, uh, how much the student,

848
00:45:51,091 --> 00:45:52,710
how much the love the students
had from it. And you know,

849
00:45:52,711 --> 00:45:54,750
he was there talking about climate
change, how students can, you know,

850
00:45:54,751 --> 00:45:58,220
solve climate change. And these guys
were all there and they were like, here,

851
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:01,650
I never saw so much optimism
and hope, you know, so like,

852
00:46:01,651 --> 00:46:05,990
I absolutely think this is a, you
know, a, a solvable problem on,

853
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,550
but we have the wrong story
and can we change that story?

854
00:46:08,551 --> 00:46:11,610
We're going to kind of be, our options
will be limited. So I thank you very much.

855
00:46:11,670 --> 00:46:13,470
I really appreciate
your time and listening.

856
00:46:18,770 --> 00:46:19,390
Okay.

857
00:46:19,390 --> 00:46:23,830
I don't know if anybody wants to ask
questions, but yes. Uh, I'm curious about

858
00:46:26,620 --> 00:46:31,620
one part of one slide possibility of a
civilization once you're in the habitable

859
00:46:32,621 --> 00:46:35,050
zone,
unbelief was tend to the negative 22,

860
00:46:35,510 --> 00:46:38,870
not the possibility that the, that if
we don't know what the actual problem

861
00:46:38,900 --> 00:46:42,800
bloody yes, right. Yeah. Right.
The limit, the pessimism limited.

862
00:46:42,801 --> 00:46:45,950
If it's below that, then we're the only
time it's ever happened. Right. If it's,

863
00:46:46,130 --> 00:46:49,460
if nature's choice for those,
that probability is above that,

864
00:46:49,461 --> 00:46:52,580
then there's been lots of wondering
if though, if you could expand,

865
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:56,420
we basically said, well, that's a really
small number. Right. And absolute value.

866
00:46:56,421 --> 00:46:59,570
It's very small. Right. So therefore I'm
going to bet that it's larger. Right.

867
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:01,700
That doesn't seem very satisfying to me.

868
00:47:01,701 --> 00:47:04,670
There are lots of numbers in nature of
the turnout to actually be very small,

869
00:47:04,830 --> 00:47:07,370
smaller than humans would have
desks and there was a tune up.

870
00:47:07,371 --> 00:47:12,200
I'd be me hugely bigger than humans would
have guessed because we tend to anchor.

871
00:47:12,380 --> 00:47:15,410
Yeah. Yeah. It was
around one. Right. Uh, so

872
00:47:16,950 --> 00:47:20,130
yes. No, that's a good point. That's why
the history of this debate is important,

873
00:47:20,131 --> 00:47:22,770
right? That number doesn't appear out
of nowhere. Yeah. Well I mean, you know,

874
00:47:22,771 --> 00:47:25,320
it comes from that number doesn't
appear out of context. Right?

875
00:47:25,321 --> 00:47:29,220
So there have been over the years, over
50 years, people trying to approximate,

876
00:47:29,260 --> 00:47:29,501
you know,

877
00:47:29,501 --> 00:47:32,650
do some kind of calculation that shows
them what this probability should be.

878
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:34,810
And the best of them all is what's the,

879
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:37,030
what's called the hard step
model by Brandon Carter.

880
00:47:37,031 --> 00:47:38,840
And that's at the heart step
models now become, you know,

881
00:47:38,930 --> 00:47:42,010
actually essential because
you could actually calculate
probabilities out of it.

882
00:47:42,011 --> 00:47:45,080
And what he did, it's typical
brilliant reasoning, you know, uh,

883
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:47,380
where he just basically like he looked
at the history of the earth and said,

884
00:47:47,410 --> 00:47:50,950
oh look, the earth is only going to be
habitable for another billion or half,

885
00:47:51,390 --> 00:47:55,060
maybe a half billion years.
And intelligence didn't show
up until the end. Right?

886
00:47:55,061 --> 00:47:57,700
So therefore it must be
intelligence must be hard. Right?

887
00:47:57,701 --> 00:47:58,540
And so then he came up with this idea,

888
00:47:58,541 --> 00:48:01,210
there must have been a bunch of hard
steps that evolution had to go through.

889
00:48:01,390 --> 00:48:05,080
So from that he was able to
use the correct probability,
distributions, et cetera.

890
00:48:05,260 --> 00:48:08,410
And he gets, you know, he estimated
that there were 10 hard steps, right?

891
00:48:08,590 --> 00:48:12,550
And so then he calculated out of that
what that probability had to be there for.

892
00:48:12,700 --> 00:48:15,910
And he got 10 to the 20 and he
concluded in that there's actually,

893
00:48:15,911 --> 00:48:18,580
I put that quote in there,
I'd have to switch all the
back. But he basically said,

894
00:48:18,970 --> 00:48:21,940
based on this 10 to the minus 20,
sorry, you said, based on this,

895
00:48:21,941 --> 00:48:24,820
we are the only time that civilization
has ever formed in the history of

896
00:48:24,821 --> 00:48:28,180
universe. Now you do that. You've got
data, you put it in and you find it. No,

897
00:48:28,181 --> 00:48:30,400
actually in your mind, and you
know, Brandon Carter's model,

898
00:48:30,460 --> 00:48:33,760
there's a hundred civilizations that have
occurred across cosmic history, right?

899
00:48:33,761 --> 00:48:36,070
And we now know that there are not no,

900
00:48:36,071 --> 00:48:38,170
but now the idea is
there's not 10 heart steps.

901
00:48:38,290 --> 00:48:41,380
There's maybe only five heart steps.
Now, again, this is all still, you know,

902
00:48:41,650 --> 00:48:45,160
controversial, you know, um, we don't
even know if the hard step model is true,

903
00:48:45,161 --> 00:48:47,520
but it's the best one that we
have that actually gives us a law,

904
00:48:47,521 --> 00:48:50,770
allows us to do something, uh,
articulate something numerically.

905
00:48:51,020 --> 00:48:54,700
And with five hard steps,
you're down to a 10 to the minus 15,

906
00:48:54,701 --> 00:48:58,830
which means there would have
been 10 million, um, uh, uh,

907
00:48:58,870 --> 00:49:01,330
civilizations over cosmic
space and time. So, you know,

908
00:49:01,340 --> 00:49:04,150
when you look at the history
and what the, uh, you know,

909
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:08,940
almost no pessimists historically
has gone that far down. So, so if,

910
00:49:09,110 --> 00:49:11,530
if they were right, there would still
have been lots of civilizations.

911
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:15,310
So hope that helps. Yeah. I mean, just,
it's still, of course we are in the realm,

912
00:49:15,311 --> 00:49:18,910
you know, until we actually find one, you
know, you're going to be dealing with,

913
00:49:18,911 --> 00:49:21,960
but the best science we have, the history
of this field, people, you know, the,

914
00:49:21,980 --> 00:49:25,630
the best estimations makes
that number very, very small.

915
00:49:27,310 --> 00:49:31,900
Yes. You're walking too much
Saifai lately. Excellent.

916
00:49:33,380 --> 00:49:38,380
Um, so I'd watch the expanse of
law fe best show ever, right?

917
00:49:38,510 --> 00:49:42,160
Yeah. The chances of humans
actually getting to the,

918
00:49:42,161 --> 00:49:44,330
to a full solar system.
Why,

919
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:49,750
what I argue often is that's the prize.
If we make it through climate change,

920
00:49:49,930 --> 00:49:52,780
that's what's waiting for us. I
mean, I really do believe, you know,

921
00:49:52,781 --> 00:49:55,720
interstellar travel where I'm actually
right now writing a paper about the Fermi

922
00:49:55,721 --> 00:49:58,810
paradox. Interstellar travel
may be very, very difficult,

923
00:49:58,990 --> 00:50:00,370
but interplanetary travel,

924
00:50:00,371 --> 00:50:04,450
especially if you have some kind of fusion
engine will not be. And, um, I think,

925
00:50:04,451 --> 00:50:06,370
you know, in another 200
years, like, who knows, right?

926
00:50:06,371 --> 00:50:10,090
There are obviously very formidable
problems, but I'm hopeful, you know,

927
00:50:10,091 --> 00:50:14,740
I'm a techno optimist and I'm hopeful
that, you know, uh, you know, in 200,

928
00:50:14,741 --> 00:50:17,950
300 years there can be a
lot of people, uh, you know,

929
00:50:17,980 --> 00:50:21,520
that this is the solar system. There's a
lot of nooks and crannies that, you know,

930
00:50:21,521 --> 00:50:24,790
human beings can, um, and, and you know,
people say, well, why would they do that?

931
00:50:24,910 --> 00:50:28,130
Because, you know, basically everybody
wants to their own society. This is,

932
00:50:28,131 --> 00:50:30,030
you know what,
I love the expanse gets right.

933
00:50:30,050 --> 00:50:32,180
There's going to be
Mormons in space for sure.

934
00:50:32,181 --> 00:50:34,820
So they can create their own
space settlement and live
Mormon light and there'll

935
00:50:34,821 --> 00:50:37,970
be the odd thousand versions
of that. So, um, I think, yeah,

936
00:50:37,971 --> 00:50:42,050
if we can just figure out climate
change and they're related, right?

937
00:50:42,050 --> 00:50:45,110
Because you're not gonna be
able to, in order to, you know,

938
00:50:45,111 --> 00:50:47,210
to solve climate change,
you have to think like a planet.

939
00:50:47,360 --> 00:50:49,760
But in order to have a self sustaining,
you know,

940
00:50:49,761 --> 00:50:53,420
whatever bubbles civilization with a
million people and that you also have to

941
00:50:53,421 --> 00:50:56,690
understand how planets think and build
a, you know, smaller version of it.

942
00:50:56,691 --> 00:51:00,530
That's why the expanse gets so well.
And you know, the scene after the, uh,

943
00:51:00,531 --> 00:51:03,770
after co what does the Callisto or
Ganymede after the station on Ganymede

944
00:51:03,771 --> 00:51:07,100
collapses and, and what's his name,
pack recognizes that, oh my God,

945
00:51:07,101 --> 00:51:09,830
the whole infer, the ecological
infrastructure of the
thing is going to collapse.

946
00:51:09,831 --> 00:51:12,740
Now does anybody watching the expanse
or people watching the expanse?

947
00:51:13,700 --> 00:51:17,000
It's really good. I really got it. And
the books are super awesome too. Yes.

948
00:51:20,510 --> 00:51:23,440
I'm curious what your thoughts are,
but yeah.

949
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:28,040
Well, first of all, I want to,
you know, there's two things,

950
00:51:28,041 --> 00:51:29,630
there's two ways to think
about the Fermi paradox.

951
00:51:29,631 --> 00:51:32,990
The first one is the idea that, um, you
know, we haven't found anybody, you know,

952
00:51:32,991 --> 00:51:35,780
we've been searching the stars for
signals. We haven't found anything.

953
00:51:35,930 --> 00:51:37,130
And that's just not true.
I mean,

954
00:51:37,131 --> 00:51:41,630
there's never really been a
large scale steady effort, right?

955
00:51:41,631 --> 00:51:43,700
Said he's never been really fully funded.
NASA,

956
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:47,460
NASA started to do a large study search
and then because of William Proxmire it

957
00:51:47,461 --> 00:51:50,210
stopped it. So as Jill
tarter says, if, you know,

958
00:51:50,211 --> 00:51:54,710
if the parameter space we have to search
for looking for aliens is the ocean,

959
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:58,340
we have looked at assemble so far,
so saying that we haven't found anything,

960
00:51:58,341 --> 00:52:00,620
it's just it, you know, that's
just not scientifically valid.

961
00:52:00,621 --> 00:52:05,290
So we barely begun to look not just in
radio but all the other possibilities. Um,

962
00:52:05,690 --> 00:52:08,010
but if you asking about the
part of the frame parsonage,

963
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:11,600
why haven't we been visited? Like why
isn't it, why don't we have evidence for,

964
00:52:11,601 --> 00:52:12,540
you know,
a civilization,

965
00:52:12,570 --> 00:52:16,430
the colonization part that actually we
find in our paper is more of a problem.

966
00:52:16,431 --> 00:52:18,830
And so the solution to that,
uh,

967
00:52:18,860 --> 00:52:21,620
right now in the paper I
think we're leaning towards
is that interstellar travel

968
00:52:21,621 --> 00:52:25,640
is really hard. You don't get
many successful colonization
missions. You know,

969
00:52:25,641 --> 00:52:28,850
obviously there's some assumptions here,
uh, in this. Um, but again, you know,

970
00:52:28,851 --> 00:52:30,860
we just did a paper a recently where with,

971
00:52:30,861 --> 00:52:33,410
I did it with Gavin Schmidt from Goddard
Institute space studies where we just

972
00:52:33,411 --> 00:52:35,480
asked how would you,
this was amazing question.

973
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:38,480
How would you know whether there was a
previous technological civilization on

974
00:52:38,481 --> 00:52:42,500
earth 20 million years ago? We actually
couldn't, right. There's really, you know,

975
00:52:42,510 --> 00:52:46,670
and there's would not be much left
over there would certainly after by 20

976
00:52:46,670 --> 00:52:50,540
million years, the surface has
been completely re, uh, re scoured.

977
00:52:50,690 --> 00:52:52,540
So you're not going to find ruins already.

978
00:52:52,550 --> 00:52:55,040
You'd have to look for isotopic
anomalies or something, which may be,

979
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:58,790
well that's the thing. No, no,
he's right. Actually that's the,

980
00:52:58,791 --> 00:53:00,470
that that is exactly what
you'd have to look for.

981
00:53:00,471 --> 00:53:02,690
So when it comes to just the earth itself,

982
00:53:02,691 --> 00:53:06,170
the earth has been weathered so heavily
in subducted that it would be hard.

983
00:53:06,171 --> 00:53:06,681
And so you know,

984
00:53:06,681 --> 00:53:09,560
there's been a couple papers on exactly
that about that the best place to look

985
00:53:09,561 --> 00:53:13,070
for this is going to be on other bodies.
So yes.

986
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:14,593
Related to that,

987
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:18,580
I think the seems to be the one part
where you really do have to n equals one

988
00:53:18,581 --> 00:53:22,010
problem is what you were
talking about the sphere, right?

989
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:24,920
Cause you have all this evidence
for what happened to previously.

990
00:53:25,220 --> 00:53:28,530
We have all these other planets out
there, right? But in a lot of this stuff,

991
00:53:28,531 --> 00:53:30,060
especially with the Fermi paradox,

992
00:53:30,810 --> 00:53:34,130
it seems to me falls prey to
this n equals one problem. We,

993
00:53:34,170 --> 00:53:39,170
you're sort of assuming that intelligent
or the civilization is going to do is

994
00:53:39,990 --> 00:53:41,070
going to behave like we expect.

995
00:53:41,570 --> 00:53:45,320
Well I think that's why, that's why my
models tried to have no sociology in them.

996
00:53:45,321 --> 00:53:48,650
It's the only assumption was a
civilization consumes energy to do work.

997
00:53:48,860 --> 00:53:50,270
That's like the only assumption in there.

998
00:53:50,271 --> 00:53:52,430
So I don't need to know sphere
or anything else, it's just that

999
00:53:52,490 --> 00:53:55,430
make assumptions about what
sort of energy production.

1000
00:53:55,620 --> 00:53:56,341
Uh,
there's only,

1001
00:53:56,341 --> 00:53:58,740
there's only so much kind of energy
production you're going to get as a young

1002
00:53:58,741 --> 00:54:01,380
civilization, right? The planet's
only going to afford you. You know,

1003
00:54:01,381 --> 00:54:04,800
if you have z raise,
I'm like super hyper high tide technology,

1004
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:07,590
well then you're already passed this
anyway, right? If you have warp drives,

1005
00:54:07,591 --> 00:54:10,320
you're not really worrying about Europe.
You know, you've probably gotten,

1006
00:54:10,470 --> 00:54:13,380
your science is so far
advanced that you're the buyer,

1007
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:14,460
you probably have already
gone through this.

1008
00:54:14,461 --> 00:54:18,000
But if you're a young civilization like
ours, you've got bio mass or you've got,

1009
00:54:18,001 --> 00:54:22,260
you've got, you can burn things. There's
wind, there's solar, there's nuclear,

1010
00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:27,420
um, and there's, um, geothermal,
right? And that's pretty
much it. It's, you can't,

1011
00:54:27,421 --> 00:54:29,100
you know,
maybe if I'm some weird planet,

1012
00:54:29,101 --> 00:54:31,710
you could have like super
magnetic fields or something.

1013
00:54:31,890 --> 00:54:33,090
So what you can do for each one of those,

1014
00:54:33,091 --> 00:54:36,450
you can evaluate what the thermodynamic
effect of using it large scale.

1015
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:37,201
So for example,

1016
00:54:37,201 --> 00:54:40,800
there was a paper done a few years ago
where they looked at trying to extract

1017
00:54:40,801 --> 00:54:42,870
from wind energy,
the power,

1018
00:54:43,060 --> 00:54:45,930
what would the consequences be of power
powering our civilization via wind.

1019
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:50,220
And what you find is because of turbulence
downstream, you end up with, you know,

1020
00:54:50,250 --> 00:54:52,630
the equivalent of like two
degrees of warming. So,

1021
00:54:52,820 --> 00:54:55,740
which is important because what it means
is you can't power a civilization like

1022
00:54:55,741 --> 00:54:59,520
this and have no impact the, and
so this goes back to nature, right?

1023
00:54:59,521 --> 00:55:00,280
The idea that there's going to be,

1024
00:55:00,280 --> 00:55:03,750
we're going to be able to
return to pristine nature,
not with us on the planet,

1025
00:55:04,050 --> 00:55:06,200
right? You can have lower impact
that you're going to have to be,

1026
00:55:06,201 --> 00:55:07,830
you're gonna have to figure
out what kind of impacts.

1027
00:55:07,950 --> 00:55:11,910
But the idea that you can have no impact
is just doesn't make sense. So yeah,

1028
00:55:11,911 --> 00:55:15,120
you can evaluate for every different
kind of energy source, you know,

1029
00:55:15,121 --> 00:55:16,880
at least make a cut at what the impact is.

1030
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,390
Assumption you're making is that
civilization requires energy.

1031
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:25,240
And that seems to be, that's something
good. I think a lot of seems to,

1032
00:55:25,290 --> 00:55:27,770
we have a very economist
way of doing things. Um,

1033
00:55:28,290 --> 00:55:30,590
well I don't see that's a feminist. I
don't understand it. If a civil as they,

1034
00:55:30,591 --> 00:55:34,000
I mean, you know, in some
sense by definition and
industrial civilization know.

1035
00:55:34,140 --> 00:55:36,510
I mean Rome, I'm not interested in
Rome, right. Because Rome wouldn't have,

1036
00:55:36,511 --> 00:55:39,870
Rome wouldn't push it's planet into
an anthropocene. Right. So you know,

1037
00:55:39,871 --> 00:55:42,780
if a civilization decides to get up to
rums level and never gets farther, yeah.

1038
00:55:42,781 --> 00:55:44,730
That sort of out of the,
you know,

1039
00:55:45,550 --> 00:55:47,460
you're right that that's
not what I'm talking about.

1040
00:55:47,461 --> 00:55:49,980
But if you build an industrial civil,
if you start heart,

1041
00:55:50,130 --> 00:55:51,930
it's all about the energy per capita,
right?

1042
00:55:51,931 --> 00:55:54,940
So right now all of us
have the equivalent of,

1043
00:55:54,970 --> 00:55:58,500
of just from our home when we go
home and our plugs, 50 servants,

1044
00:55:58,890 --> 00:56:00,420
that's the energy equivalent 50 servants.

1045
00:56:00,421 --> 00:56:03,270
And that doesn't say anything about
your transportation or whatever.

1046
00:56:03,300 --> 00:56:07,830
So once a species gets to the point where
the per capita energy use becomes more

1047
00:56:07,831 --> 00:56:10,710
than one individual's
worth per individual,

1048
00:56:10,890 --> 00:56:12,450
that's when you're going to
start feeding back. So that,

1049
00:56:12,451 --> 00:56:14,520
that's the only assumption.
If they start doing that,

1050
00:56:14,700 --> 00:56:17,700
then they sort of fall into the category
that I'm interested in. And then he got,

1051
00:56:17,720 --> 00:56:20,730
I don't really care about sociology or
whether they develop a no sphere or not.

1052
00:56:20,731 --> 00:56:21,750
Maybe they do,
maybe they don't.

1053
00:56:21,900 --> 00:56:25,270
It's just that they're harvesting
energy to do the work of building their

1054
00:56:25,271 --> 00:56:26,104
civilization.

1055
00:56:27,260 --> 00:56:27,840
Yeah.

1056
00:56:27,840 --> 00:56:32,030
So do you think that the current home
where basically as a matter of marketing

1057
00:56:32,170 --> 00:56:35,920
that we have the tools,
sort of the guidance, the,

1058
00:56:36,710 --> 00:56:39,770
there'll be neat to get through it if
we all just somehow add it together?

1059
00:56:40,210 --> 00:56:41,650
Yeah, I think that's, you know, there was,

1060
00:56:41,651 --> 00:56:45,340
I was just reading recently about a study
that sort of showed a super detailed

1061
00:56:45,341 --> 00:56:49,450
study that you could actually power,
you know, the world with renewables,

1062
00:56:49,451 --> 00:56:51,830
with wind, water, you know,
but the thing, but you know,

1063
00:56:51,840 --> 00:56:55,360
it's always a really detailed plan for
doing it. Of course it required this,

1064
00:56:55,361 --> 00:56:56,260
you know, sort of, you know,

1065
00:56:56,261 --> 00:56:59,740
World War Two Manhattan style
project for the entire world.

1066
00:56:59,741 --> 00:57:02,680
And so that's going to be hard. But
in terms of like technologically, man,

1067
00:57:02,681 --> 00:57:05,110
unleash the innovation, let us,
that's one of this, you know,

1068
00:57:05,111 --> 00:57:08,080
when I go out and I'm talking to people,
one things I'm saying is like, you know,

1069
00:57:08,470 --> 00:57:11,850
on one level climate change shows how
awesome we are, right? I mean, you know,

1070
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:14,680
we've changed the atmosphere
of an entire planet.

1071
00:57:14,681 --> 00:57:18,100
That's pretty good for a bunch of
hair hairless monkeys, you know? Um,

1072
00:57:18,220 --> 00:57:18,851
and now the question is,

1073
00:57:18,851 --> 00:57:22,690
are we smart enough to innovate our way
into some kind of sustainable version of

1074
00:57:22,700 --> 00:57:25,810
it? So it's, you know, so it's not just
marketing though. It's deeper than that.

1075
00:57:25,811 --> 00:57:30,610
It's myth, right? Human beings always need
stories. I don't, you know, somebody said,

1076
00:57:30,611 --> 00:57:34,000
you know, stories where the first
technology and the problem is here,

1077
00:57:34,001 --> 00:57:36,640
we have all of these from the, you
know, long history of humanity.

1078
00:57:36,641 --> 00:57:41,190
We have these myths about
the coming of age, about
marriage, about old age. Um, uh,

1079
00:57:41,350 --> 00:57:44,920
but we don't have any. And we have
creation myths. But climate change,

1080
00:57:45,100 --> 00:57:48,220
we don't have a myth for, because it's
new. We've never done this before.

1081
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:50,590
And so what I'm suggesting is,
is that, you know, a first,

1082
00:57:50,591 --> 00:57:52,480
it's not like this alone
is gonna solve anything,

1083
00:57:52,660 --> 00:57:54,340
but if we don't change the narrative,

1084
00:57:54,341 --> 00:57:58,600
we are stuck arguing with people about
whether we change the climate or not.

1085
00:57:58,810 --> 00:58:02,080
From this perspective, that
question just disappears. It's like,

1086
00:58:02,140 --> 00:58:03,730
of course you change the climate.

1087
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:07,240
You built a civilization that consumes
a quarter of the entire biospheres

1088
00:58:07,330 --> 00:58:11,770
productive capacity, you know, what did
you expect? So I think it just, you know,

1089
00:58:11,771 --> 00:58:14,740
one of the things in revolutions in
scientific revolutions that happen is that

1090
00:58:14,741 --> 00:58:17,170
the old questions,
when you go through a paradigm shift,

1091
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:18,850
it's not that the old
questions are answered,

1092
00:58:18,851 --> 00:58:20,590
the whole question just don't
even become meaningful anymore.

1093
00:58:20,591 --> 00:58:23,710
People ask a new set of questions and
that's at least what I'm proposing with

1094
00:58:23,711 --> 00:58:24,480
this.

1095
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:28,430
Yeah. This might try it a
little bit more philosophical,

1096
00:58:28,431 --> 00:58:32,570
although they're clearly
philosophical ideas. Yeah. Um,

1097
00:58:32,840 --> 00:58:34,460
you mentioned that you're an optimist.

1098
00:58:34,580 --> 00:58:38,610
And piggy backing on the question
about marketing, I'm sort of,

1099
00:58:40,250 --> 00:58:45,250
my worry is that there is not in fact

1100
00:58:47,720 --> 00:58:52,130
present in human thinking, the idea that
humanity is in fact a single species.

1101
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:56,470
Yeah. We can sort of think
about this as a collaborator,

1102
00:58:56,570 --> 00:58:58,160
as a truly collaborative project.

1103
00:58:58,580 --> 00:59:02,170
And I think one way to be pessimistic
about this as to worry about factum

1104
00:59:02,930 --> 00:59:04,190
minimization and whatnot.

1105
00:59:04,250 --> 00:59:08,810
Do you have thoughts that make you
more optimistic on that? Is it sort of,

1106
00:59:09,190 --> 00:59:12,240
and I'm not saying that blind faith
would be unreasonable perhaps. Yeah.

1107
00:59:13,630 --> 00:59:17,480
Yeah. I mean it's gotten us through
a lot. Um, but no, actually, so,

1108
00:59:17,481 --> 00:59:20,000
so I think when you look across species,
you know,

1109
00:59:20,030 --> 00:59:25,030
I know I feel confident in my bones
that there've been other civilizations,

1110
00:59:25,491 --> 00:59:25,791
right?
You know,

1111
00:59:25,791 --> 00:59:28,250
scientifically I can only go forward
the probabilities that this has happened

1112
00:59:28,251 --> 00:59:28,850
before.

1113
00:59:28,850 --> 00:59:33,850
And what I imagine is the ones that
make it have either the evolutionary

1114
00:59:35,360 --> 00:59:37,730
background to have the right
kinds of behaviors, maybe,

1115
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:41,390
maybe hive minds much easier if you're
a hive mind to make it through this then

1116
00:59:41,391 --> 00:59:44,840
if you're a, the kind of thing that we
are. But the other possibility is that,

1117
00:59:44,841 --> 00:59:46,790
you know, you evolve
under pressure, right?

1118
00:59:47,180 --> 00:59:50,570
Selective pressure is what
determines a evolution. And you know,

1119
00:59:50,571 --> 00:59:55,490
perhaps this is the agent by
which we start to, uh, create
new behaviors. You know,

1120
00:59:55,491 --> 00:59:56,810
the Paris accord was weak,

1121
00:59:57,080 --> 01:00:00,620
but the Paris accord was also remarkable
in those sense that we've got every

1122
01:00:00,621 --> 01:00:02,210
country to sign this thing.

1123
01:00:02,390 --> 01:00:06,860
So that was the beginning and then we
took a step back. Um, but you know,

1124
01:00:06,861 --> 01:00:09,060
so I think, you know, this is
this May, the cl, you know,

1125
01:00:09,080 --> 01:00:14,030
the anthropocenes maybe the agent for
some kinds of species, perhaps like ours,

1126
01:00:14,031 --> 01:00:16,940
to develop new evolutionary behaviors
that allow them to get through and

1127
01:00:16,950 --> 01:00:18,770
everything. You make it through.
You know, it's weird like, Hey,

1128
01:00:18,771 --> 01:00:21,530
if I put my hat on as a dad, I'm like,
Oh my God, we've got to make it through.

1129
01:00:21,890 --> 01:00:23,990
But if I put my hat on as an
astronomer, I'm like, yes,

1130
01:00:23,991 --> 01:00:28,670
I'll make it through some don't, you know?
Yeah. Nothing special about us. Okay.

1131
01:00:28,790 --> 01:00:31,160
All right. Well, thank you very much.
Uh, I really appreciate you guys

1132
01:00:31,580 --> 01:00:36,180
[inaudible].
