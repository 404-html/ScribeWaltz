1
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:10,080
[inaudible].

2
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:11,773
Hi everybody.

3
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:17,220
I guess my job is to ask
you how you're feeling. Um,

4
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:18,543
you think I'm kidding.

5
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,340
I have to just say before I start
that I did not create the title for my

6
00:00:22,341 --> 00:00:26,260
presentation.
I have to put the onus there and Danielle,

7
00:00:26,261 --> 00:00:30,140
I would probably get fired from this
presentation title. I'm just kidding.

8
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:34,880
Um,
so I want to start off with a quote

9
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:39,890
can ask everyone to get some like
maybe good posture in your seats,

10
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:43,070
some of your like,
take a nice inhale,

11
00:00:43,071 --> 00:00:48,071
maybe just get settled and just think
about how this quote resonates with you.

12
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:51,560
And I'll just read it.

13
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:56,570
No one cares how much you know
until they know how much you care.

14
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:01,993
What do we think?

15
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:04,280
Okay.

16
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:08,030
Does that resonate with you at all or
are you thinking, well, I'm pretty smart,

17
00:01:08,031 --> 00:01:10,040
right?
My students at Y'all say that a lot.

18
00:01:10,041 --> 00:01:13,190
Like what do you mean nobody
cares how much, you know, I
know everything. I'm like,

19
00:01:13,191 --> 00:01:17,420
well, maybe about some things, probably
not about how to interact very well. But,

20
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:21,200
um,
and you know,

21
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:23,540
my work is primarily in education.

22
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:27,530
So I work with school systems to help
bring the principles of emotional

23
00:01:27,531 --> 00:01:30,740
intelligence into what I call the immune
system of the way the school operates,

24
00:01:30,741 --> 00:01:33,380
from how leaders lead
to how teachers teach,

25
00:01:33,381 --> 00:01:35,510
to how students learn
to help parents parent.

26
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:40,370
And what I've learned over the years is
that this quote really is the truth for

27
00:01:40,371 --> 00:01:42,350
the way education works.

28
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:46,940
As a 47 year old
psychologist, professor, um,

29
00:01:46,941 --> 00:01:50,960
I went back to the middle school
that I attended about five years ago,

30
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:55,270
after 33 years ago, a bullying. Uh,

31
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:00,020
it was a pretty horrifically bullied kid.
And, um, when I went back to my school,

32
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:03,920
I had no memories of anything I learned.

33
00:02:03,921 --> 00:02:08,090
I had no memories of, of my
even many of my peers. Uh,

34
00:02:08,091 --> 00:02:09,380
I couldn't remember any teachers name,

35
00:02:09,381 --> 00:02:13,250
but I remember how I felt walking in that
hallway, like the terror and the fear.

36
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,030
Um, and I remember thinking, why didn't
anybody ever asked me how I felt?

37
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,510
Why didn't anyone ever
attend to my feelings? Um,

38
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:23,260
hence now I spend my whole
life running around the world,

39
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:26,090
getting everybody to talk
about their feelings. Um,

40
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:30,180
so one tool that we developed to help
people become aware of feelings just to

41
00:02:30,181 --> 00:02:31,970
the basic level is called the mood meter.

42
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:33,890
So I'm going to teach you a
little bit about this right now.

43
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:37,910
All of you got some email or whatever.

44
00:02:37,911 --> 00:02:41,480
Notice you got here at Google about a
presentation on emotional intelligence and

45
00:02:41,481 --> 00:02:44,390
you're here now, which is wonderful. Um,

46
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:49,750
so my question for you is how are you
feeling right now not about life minus

47
00:02:51,981 --> 00:02:55,160
five would be you're having
thoughts, something like, really,

48
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:59,050
I have to listen to this guy for a whole
hour. Like that's, that's what we do now.

49
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:03,130
Google, we have people come talk
about feelings. Maybe you're there,

50
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:05,830
maybe you're at minus
three and pleasantness.

51
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:09,520
You're having thoughts or something like,
yeah,

52
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:13,630
whatever
maybe or neutral.

53
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:19,060
I live in Connecticut now. I feel like
that's the state of our entire state,

54
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:23,320
right? We're like the neutral
state. Um, not a lot of emotion.

55
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:26,080
Maybe you're a plus three. You're
thinking to yourself, my goodness,

56
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:30,250
I get to sit in a room with a guy from
Connecticut that who's going to talk

57
00:03:30,251 --> 00:03:33,580
about feelings, uh, are
maybe or a plus five.

58
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:36,850
Like there are no words in the
English language dictionary,

59
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,280
right to describe the feeling
you're having right now.

60
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:44,880
So please give yourself a number from
minus five to plus five in terms of your

61
00:03:45,131 --> 00:03:50,080
current level of pleasantness.
And the y axis is his energy.

62
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:54,310
So energy has to do literally with
how much activation you have going on,

63
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:58,240
plus five [inaudible].
You're so activated, you
just can't contain yourself.

64
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:01,570
Minus five is you're in your
deepest pool of despair.

65
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:06,310
Minus five. Do you feel like you're
being pulled into the ground?

66
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:10,120
Plus five is you are just so highly
energized. You can't contain your body.

67
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:12,430
Where's your energy right now?

68
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:20,070
Obviously we create our mood meter from
these two axes. So we've got yellow, red,

69
00:04:20,071 --> 00:04:21,840
blue, and green. Let me
just see where you are.

70
00:04:21,841 --> 00:04:25,050
How many of you are feeling yellow
right now? High Energy and pleasant.

71
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,020
Okay, that's impressive. Um, how many
of you are green? You're a pleasant,

72
00:04:31,021 --> 00:04:32,160
but your energy's kind of low.

73
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:36,480
How many of you are in
the blue or red today?

74
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:39,613
Okay,

75
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:44,460
the three people sitting in the back row.
Okay, Alicia got good distance from me.

76
00:04:44,461 --> 00:04:48,090
That's good. Um, now the question is,

77
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,820
are we being authentic
and honest right now?

78
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:56,820
Is it true that 85 to 90% of the room
is actually feeling quote unquote yellow

79
00:04:56,821 --> 00:05:01,500
and green? Highly doubtful. I mean
maybe life here. Is that amazing?

80
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:06,330
I live in Connecticut or the East Coast
is not known for its yellow and green

81
00:05:06,331 --> 00:05:08,090
feelings.
Um,

82
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:12,390
what I want you to do right now is take
about three seconds and convert your

83
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:17,820
quadrant to a word.
Take three seconds please.

84
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:22,410
What is the word that best
describes your current feeling?

85
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:27,150
All right. Freeze. Gimme
an honest raise of hands.

86
00:05:27,151 --> 00:05:30,660
How many of you had some trouble
finding the precise word?

87
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:35,220
Hands up high. Like really high?
Please look around the room. Everybody.

88
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:37,290
Okay,

89
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:39,840
so it's interesting.
I mean at least it is Timmy.

90
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:45,650
Here we are our room filled with highly
educated people who are emotionally

91
00:05:46,561 --> 00:05:51,060
illiterate. Okay. Now I'd be like,

92
00:05:51,061 --> 00:05:54,870
I don't like this guy already. I
want to ask you for, take a second.

93
00:05:54,871 --> 00:05:59,180
What are your hypotheses around that? What
do you think? Why would it be, I mean,

94
00:05:59,181 --> 00:06:01,070
truthfully,
you're all highly educated people.

95
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:05,270
Why would you not be able to find a word
to describe how you're failing? Yes.

96
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:09,260
There's many feelings happening
at the same time. Like how many?

97
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:11,300
Like 14.

98
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:15,700
Okay.
Well we have treatment for that.

99
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,990
Alright. You're right
though. You could have,

100
00:06:19,991 --> 00:06:24,040
you feel you may be filling more than
one emotion. 14 is a lot, but I'll, I'll,

101
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:25,533
yeah.

102
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:30,710
I think that the way that our success
is structure rewards us for divorcing,

103
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:33,470
um, intelligence and
strategy from our emotions.

104
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:36,910
Okay. So like we're in a society that
just has like put the feelings aside.

105
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:40,270
So maybe you haven't developed your
vocabulary for it because you're having

106
00:06:40,271 --> 00:06:43,180
attended to it.
Any other hypotheses?

107
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:45,470
Yeah,

108
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:49,550
it's a natural resistance to collapsing
the complexity of your internal state.

109
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:50,893
We'll color.

110
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:54,800
Uh Huh.
So there's this repeat that please.

111
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:03,250
Natural resistance to collapsing
the complexity to what?

112
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:04,531
All right.

113
00:07:04,531 --> 00:07:09,531
So maybe it's like we're just way too
dynamic to put ourselves into one quadrant

114
00:07:10,951 --> 00:07:13,800
or one feeling word. Very
point. Yeah. Last one.

115
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:18,603
Yup.

116
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:25,920
Yup. So maybe around how your focus,
what your, where your focus is, right?

117
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:30,600
If I asked you how you feeling in life,
that's a very big question.

118
00:07:30,601 --> 00:07:33,840
If I ask you how you're
feeling about attending a talk
on emotional intelligence,

119
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:38,430
it might help you be more precise
potentially. Now. All right.

120
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:43,830
All of you are here for an hour.
That's the time of the presentation.

121
00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:49,010
How many of you will have some trouble
staying focused for a whole hour?

122
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:53,760
Raise your hand. Okay, wonderful. Great.

123
00:07:53,761 --> 00:07:57,000
I have a room filled with
attention deficit disorder. Um,

124
00:07:57,390 --> 00:07:59,970
just what I hope for in life.
Um,

125
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,210
so I'm going to give
you an ideal spot to be.

126
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:07,320
I would like you to be around plus
one plus one for my presentation.

127
00:08:08,010 --> 00:08:10,050
I'm going to set an emotion goal for you.

128
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:13,140
I'm going to call that
the spot of joyful effort.

129
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:18,570
And what I'd like you to do is think
about where you are in reference to that

130
00:08:18,571 --> 00:08:23,571
point and what strategy my best serve
you to kind of stay there for the next 45

131
00:08:24,871 --> 00:08:25,704
minutes.

132
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:30,280
What strategy will best serve you?

133
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:34,030
Who feels they have a
an effective strategy?

134
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:40,780
No one. I'll be back.
Yeah, just being relaxed.

135
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,310
Just being relaxed.

136
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:46,050
Challenging things.
That speaker says,

137
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:52,200
I want the critical person in the road.
Like I don't like what I just said.

138
00:08:52,201 --> 00:08:54,880
I want to argue that one. Yeah. Let

139
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:55,980
me,
if you can see how it

140
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:58,890
helps you a lot in life even
becoming just to the old state.

141
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:01,180
So I'll make it relevant to your life.

142
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,250
She goes to the opposite of his,
which was being receptive.

143
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:08,420
Thank you. Thank you. Take
it outside. Yeah. All right,

144
00:09:08,421 --> 00:09:11,060
so one is going to be more critical.
You're going to be open,

145
00:09:11,061 --> 00:09:14,540
you're going to be relaxed to, you are
going to make it relevant to your life.

146
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:20,420
You're going to just focus.
Yeah. Keeping it. Yes sir.

147
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:23,620
To be be present.

148
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:27,580
Yeah. They want to be present. All right.

149
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:31,900
So let's take this into the real world
because this is definitely not the real

150
00:09:31,901 --> 00:09:36,460
world. And let's imagine
now I am what I do a lot.

151
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:40,810
I go into Middle School here in
Palo Alto and I walk in and say,

152
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:45,590
when everybody, my name is mark, I'm going
to be your teacher today and I know, uh,

153
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:46,720
your teacher loved me,
the script,

154
00:09:46,721 --> 00:09:50,140
we're going to be doing their
Roman oligarchy today. Okay?

155
00:09:50,141 --> 00:09:51,520
So what I want you to do,

156
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,150
I know that my goal is for you to be
in that kind of low yellow. And here's,

157
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:59,230
I'm going to just offer you some
strategies, just, just chill.

158
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:03,130
Just relax and be here,
okay?

159
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:09,190
I need you to make this relevant
to your life. If that doesn't work,

160
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:10,533
just be open.

161
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:18,720
And what I really want you to
do is it's just focus, right?

162
00:10:18,721 --> 00:10:22,800
There is no past.
We know the future is like whatever.

163
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:26,700
So just be here with me now.
Be here in the present moment.

164
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:32,040
All right? Ready to go? What do you think?

165
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:35,820
How effective are those strategies?

166
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:41,220
So I want you to just take
a moment and think about it.

167
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:43,080
Well those strategies work.

168
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:47,280
How many of you ever asked
someone to calm down?

169
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:50,010
All right.

170
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:53,400
And how many of you in the hyster asking
someone to calm down and have found

171
00:10:53,401 --> 00:10:56,880
that it really works, right? Like
with your partner? Like honey,

172
00:10:56,881 --> 00:11:01,500
I love you but like I just need
you to calm down. All right,

173
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:04,980
what? I want to make someone mad.
That's what I say. Say. There you go.

174
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:09,360
So telling us that one
to strategize is complex.

175
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:13,890
Anything else that you see wrong with
those strategies or potentially right?

176
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:14,690
Yeah.

177
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:19,160
Well you're putting the onus of us
being attentive on us and not one,

178
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:20,013
both of us.

179
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:23,650
Oh good point.
You actually bring up a really good point,

180
00:11:23,651 --> 00:11:28,480
which is that emotions are not
necessarily always self regulated, right?

181
00:11:28,481 --> 00:11:31,920
That we are in relationship
and they are co-regulating

182
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:34,990
think about that,
right?

183
00:11:34,991 --> 00:11:39,850
Whether it's a device that you're in
the room with or whether it's a human

184
00:11:39,851 --> 00:11:41,110
being,
right?

185
00:11:41,111 --> 00:11:46,111
You're in a co-regulation process because
how I present the facial expressions,

186
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:50,980
body language, vocal tones, the way
I present myself will influence.

187
00:11:50,981 --> 00:11:54,010
And be contagious.
I many ways to your feelings,

188
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:56,980
which will then in turn come back to me.

189
00:11:57,310 --> 00:11:59,800
So we're in this dynamic
reciprocal relationship right now,

190
00:11:59,801 --> 00:12:04,300
whether we're conscious of it or not.
So as your teacher right now,

191
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:05,950
I am influencing how you're feeling,

192
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:10,780
which is a form of self regulation
or co-regulation. Other points.

193
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:18,080
Yeah. So you're getting
to the specificity, right?

194
00:12:18,081 --> 00:12:22,490
You can't just say be present or be
focused or become like what do you do to

195
00:12:22,491 --> 00:12:24,230
become,
what do you do to be present?

196
00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:27,290
Everyone here just said that they're
going to have attention problems.

197
00:12:27,291 --> 00:12:30,650
So what is the actual mental
strategy that you're engaging in?

198
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:34,010
To manage the feeling or
to create the feeling.

199
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:36,030
Okay.

200
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:38,940
Alright, everyone, sit up straight
in your seats for a moment. Please

201
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:45,300
take a nice long inhale and I exhale.

202
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:50,640
And if you're comfortable, close
your eyes. If not, not a problem.

203
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,630
It's five o'clock in the morning,
you're probably waste leap.

204
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:59,340
It's six maybe or seven o'clock in the
morning. You wake up. How do you feel?

205
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:05,370
This is internal talk right now as
you wake up each morning, typical day,

206
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:06,353
how do you feel?

207
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:08,490
Okay.

208
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:09,480
It's breakfast time.

209
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:13,280
Are you eating breakfast at home or are
you waiting to get to work or you're

210
00:13:13,281 --> 00:13:15,450
having a good cup of coffee?
A bad cup of coffee.

211
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:18,840
How do you feel when you do
your morning routine? All right.

212
00:13:18,841 --> 00:13:22,590
You're on your way to work. Traffic.
No traffic, public transportation.

213
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:23,933
How do you feel?

214
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:26,590
Okay.

215
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:27,760
What are you doing on your way to work?

216
00:13:27,761 --> 00:13:32,170
Texting like you shouldn't be phone calls.
Radio.

217
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:35,680
All right. You arrive at
work, you walk around.

218
00:13:35,681 --> 00:13:37,780
How do you feel meeting one,

219
00:13:37,781 --> 00:13:40,510
meeting two meaning three mini four
meaning five meaning six meetings, seven,

220
00:13:40,511 --> 00:13:45,340
28 million, 9 million. 10. Take
yourself through those meetings. Emails,

221
00:13:45,341 --> 00:13:49,000
no emails. Phone calls, no phone calls.
The text, no texts. How do you feel?

222
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:54,070
Lunchtime. Healthy.
Unhealthy, relaxed. Stressful.

223
00:13:55,600 --> 00:14:00,490
I use chewing. Or are you just
swallowing? How do you feel at lunch?

224
00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:03,190
Who are you with?
Are you alone or with others?

225
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:08,540
Is it enjoyable or are you under pressure?
Okay,

226
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:13,210
it's after lunch. More meetings, more
emails, more meetings, more emails,

227
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:17,810
distractions. How are you feeling
in the afternoon? All right,

228
00:14:18,410 --> 00:14:23,370
you're leaving work. What time
is it and where are you going?

229
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:28,320
Exercise. No exercise. Oh,
no. Time for exercise. Kids.

230
00:14:28,321 --> 00:14:31,110
No kids, partner, no partner. Family,

231
00:14:31,111 --> 00:14:35,040
no family with the afternoon like,
and how are you feeling?

232
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,440
Are you get home? Who is there?
Are you alone or with other people?

233
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:47,380
What's your evening like? You're watching
America's got talent or not reading,

234
00:14:47,381 --> 00:14:48,214
not reading.

235
00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:53,720
What's your evening like and how are
you feeling most evenings? All right,

236
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:58,130
it's time to go to bed.
What's your evening routine like?

237
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:02,000
What are you thinking about
as you put yourself to sleep?

238
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:14,400
Raise your hand if you think you had a
couple hundred emotions throughout the

239
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,233
day.

240
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:20,870
We should all raise your hand because you
probably had a couple of thousand. Uh,

241
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:25,500
we tend to experience around three
to five emotions in a minute in some

242
00:15:25,501 --> 00:15:30,050
instances. Um, how many of you saw us?

243
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,860
But I won't ask you to raise your hands,

244
00:15:31,861 --> 00:15:36,780
but if I were to ask you to kind of
plot yourself back on that mood meter,

245
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:41,190
do you see yourself kind of living in
one quadrant more throughout the day?

246
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:43,950
Do you see yourself going
throughout different quadrants?

247
00:15:43,951 --> 00:15:46,080
Like yellow in the morning
and then blow it the meeting.

248
00:15:46,081 --> 00:15:48,270
And then red here and then
green here and then yellow here.

249
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:54,590
So I've been really interested as a
researcher as to what are or what is the

250
00:15:55,111 --> 00:15:56,520
emotional life of our nation.

251
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:00,880
And I've done three large studies
over the last couple of years. Uh,

252
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:05,460
the first one was a study with 45,000
high school students across the nation.

253
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:09,150
And this isn't collaboration,
uh, with the pop singer,

254
00:16:09,151 --> 00:16:11,430
Lady Gaga and her
foundation born this way,

255
00:16:11,431 --> 00:16:15,540
foundation and what we did a with
funding from the Robert Wood Johnson

256
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:15,961
Foundation,

257
00:16:15,961 --> 00:16:18,960
we coin across United States and we
looked at the state of emotional fair.

258
00:16:18,961 --> 00:16:21,900
So I asked you to think
about your feelings first.

259
00:16:22,890 --> 00:16:27,890
Now let's think about our nation's youth
top three feelings that you believe our

260
00:16:28,471 --> 00:16:31,320
nation's high school is public,
private and charter are feeling.

261
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:36,120
What do you think?
Confused. Stressed. Fear.

262
00:16:36,121 --> 00:16:40,680
Insecure. Depressed. If I'm
going to ask you to think about,

263
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:44,070
look at it.
We got one optimist in the room.

264
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,610
If you were to take the whole pie of 100%
what percent are positive and emotions

265
00:16:49,611 --> 00:16:51,630
is what percent of negative emotions?
What do you think?

266
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:53,893
Nine,

267
00:16:56,200 --> 00:17:00,490
two thirds negative. All right,
well here are the results.

268
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:07,060
By 75% were negative.
Top three feelings.

269
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:11,830
We're tired, board and stressed
and went a little deeper.

270
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:14,200
And what we did was we
looked at all right,

271
00:17:14,201 --> 00:17:19,000
what percentage of the time are these
kids experiencing these emotions?

272
00:17:19,001 --> 00:17:23,740
We found that they say they're
stressed 80% of the time stressed, uh,

273
00:17:23,770 --> 00:17:26,890
80% of the time board 70% of the time.

274
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:31,690
So I want you to think about like what's
happening if you want to think about

275
00:17:31,691 --> 00:17:34,350
innovation and creativity,
right?

276
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:37,840
What happens if you're in an
environment where you're feeling tired,

277
00:17:37,841 --> 00:17:39,630
board and stressed, Hungover,
Warren's drafts, tired, worn, rest,

278
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:40,510
high board and stressed.

279
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:45,190
Now as a professor at a
pretty prestigious place,

280
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:48,400
I was curious like what's the state
of emotional affairs of the brightest

281
00:17:48,401 --> 00:17:49,530
crayons in the box?

282
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:55,050
So I did a study last year with undergrads
and here is the state of affairs at

283
00:17:55,051 --> 00:17:59,770
Yale. It looks a little
similar, doesn't it?

284
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:04,720
Stress, number one, overwhelmed, anxious,
frustrated. There some excitement,

285
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:09,880
uh, which is good, but about 70% of
the emotions they're experiencing.

286
00:18:11,050 --> 00:18:13,120
And then I went and I said,
I'm really interested in teachers,

287
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:16,060
which is my primary area.
I said,

288
00:18:16,061 --> 00:18:19,060
what does the state of of
affairs of America's educators,

289
00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:25,510
frustrated, stressed, overwhelmed,
some happiness and joyful.

290
00:18:25,511 --> 00:18:27,010
But if you look at the,
all the little words,

291
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:30,100
most of them are not
the most pleasant words.

292
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:34,030
And then with funding
from another foundation,

293
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:38,110
I decided to look at 25,000 people
across the entire workforce.

294
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:42,820
And here's what people across
the United States feel. I work.

295
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:48,160
Stress is the number one
feeling. Some other ones too,
a little bit of motivation,

296
00:18:48,161 --> 00:18:51,940
busy, tired, engaged. And
what we know from our work,

297
00:18:51,941 --> 00:18:54,070
right is that there's the
good stress and bad stress.

298
00:18:54,910 --> 00:18:58,390
I actually like to hire people
who experience some stress.

299
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:03,420
I like people have slight anxiety
problems or they get stuck,

300
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:07,090
they get stuff done.
Um, that's good stress.

301
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:11,440
Unfortunately, when we do the more
detailed analysis of what's happening,

302
00:19:11,441 --> 00:19:14,080
we find that it's most of the bad
stress that people are feeling.

303
00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:15,850
The stress that makes them
not want to go to work.

304
00:19:15,851 --> 00:19:19,120
This stress that makes him not really
be present at work, that's just,

305
00:19:19,121 --> 00:19:22,180
that makes them feel physically sick.
Now,

306
00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:24,940
for most of my career,

307
00:19:24,941 --> 00:19:29,860
I've been fighting people in
terms of caring about emotions.

308
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:34,150
Just for your, uh, my own curiosity
for people here at Google.

309
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:37,750
How many of you believe that
these feelings that you just saw

310
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:43,860
from tired board and stressed to stressed,
overwhelmed and anxious to frustrated,

311
00:19:43,861 --> 00:19:46,680
stressed and overwhelmed,
distressed matter

312
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:52,250
and matter for important
things about a person's life?

313
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:57,710
So what I've learned in my research is
that emotions matter for five big reasons.

314
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:00,140
The first of the attention,
memory learning.

315
00:20:00,770 --> 00:20:05,770
So how you're feeling right now in my
presentation is driving your presence,

316
00:20:06,890 --> 00:20:11,300
your focus, your engagement,
your critical analysis.

317
00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:15,830
If you're a board,
you're already somewhere else.

318
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:20,360
You're already working on your project.
If you're frustrated,

319
00:20:20,361 --> 00:20:24,470
you're back there thinking, oh my God,
what am I going to do? If you're stressed,

320
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:28,640
you're thinking, how do we get
out of here? So I think back now,

321
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:32,590
33 years ago when I was in middle
school and being bullied. And why?

322
00:20:32,591 --> 00:20:36,320
I have no memory of anything that
I learned. It was because why?

323
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:41,330
Because my brain with
preoccupied with survival, right?

324
00:20:41,331 --> 00:20:44,510
My brain was preoccupied with friendships,
the need for friendships.

325
00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:47,030
So why would I want to be in a classroom?

326
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:50,800
Why would I even care about learning
about the Roman oligarchy when I'm afraid

327
00:20:50,801 --> 00:20:54,520
to walk home or when I'm not
having positive relationships?

328
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:56,770
The second is decision making.

329
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:00,130
I'm just curious if any of
you ever made a bad decision.

330
00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:06,970
Anyone like to just share publicly right
now to just let it out so we know that

331
00:21:06,971 --> 00:21:11,890
how we feel shifts the way we
make choices and decisions.

332
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:14,830
I'll give you one example.
So in my work with schools,

333
00:21:15,130 --> 00:21:17,830
I did a random experiment
where I took educators.

334
00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:22,690
Let's imagine you're all teachers and I
just randomly assign you think about a

335
00:21:22,691 --> 00:21:26,020
day. That was great. Think about a day
that was shitty. Great Day, Shitty Day,

336
00:21:26,050 --> 00:21:29,800
great day, Shitty Day. It's been
five minutes just writing about it.

337
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:35,770
And then immediately thereafter I gave
every single educator in that study the

338
00:21:35,771 --> 00:21:38,200
same essay to read.

339
00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:43,030
Does anyone think there were differences
in the grades? They assigned,

340
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:49,150
there was a one to two full grade
difference and the way the teachers on a

341
00:21:49,151 --> 00:21:50,770
greater these students,
right?

342
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:54,790
Just five minute little essay or writing
assignment about good day, bad day,

343
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:58,690
and then they graded the paper and there
were one to two full grade on average

344
00:21:58,691 --> 00:21:59,524
difference.

345
00:21:59,890 --> 00:22:03,100
I kind of knew it was going to happen
cause I know how emotions influence

346
00:22:03,101 --> 00:22:07,900
thinking. I think what interested me
most was at the end of the study I said,

347
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:13,170
do you believe that how you felt
influence the way you evaluated the essay?

348
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:19,570
What percentage of the educators
do you said, yeah, of course.

349
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,950
Right about 90% denied it.

350
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:29,440
They said there's no way that how I
felt what an influence the way evaluated

351
00:22:29,441 --> 00:22:33,190
that essay.
And I think what that tells us is a lot.

352
00:22:33,670 --> 00:22:38,670
I think the primary thing is that our
emotions are influencing and biasing the

353
00:22:40,091 --> 00:22:42,490
way we're seeing the world and
the choices that we're making,

354
00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:45,280
but it's happening outside
of our conscious awareness.

355
00:22:46,870 --> 00:22:49,960
The third is relationship quality.
Just curious,

356
00:22:49,961 --> 00:22:53,740
does anyone here have a colleague did
not look to your left or your right?

357
00:22:54,450 --> 00:22:59,110
Uh, or a relative who displays
a lot of negative emotion.

358
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:02,860
Someone who maybe walks around like this,

359
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:10,390
does anybody know something like that?
Or they're very disagreeable.

360
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:14,890
I don't like that idea. Why you want
to do it that way? Um, where I work,

361
00:23:14,891 --> 00:23:17,200
I get things like this perfect bracket.
I've got a question.

362
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:23,950
I'm not really sure you know
the answer. Okay? Not a problem.

363
00:23:24,010 --> 00:23:27,220
A lot of problem.
Can't wait to grade your freaking paper.

364
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:33,130
And so we know that emotions are signals

365
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:37,660
and they tell us to approach our to avoid.

366
00:23:38,530 --> 00:23:42,290
So when we think about people and
we think about products, right?

367
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:47,060
How they make us feel makes want
to move toward them or against,

368
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:50,900
does that resonate with everyone?
So that,

369
00:23:51,290 --> 00:23:53,930
and that's a basic thing around survival,
right?

370
00:23:53,931 --> 00:23:58,370
We don't approach the angering expression
because we got to protect ourselves

371
00:23:58,371 --> 00:24:02,450
from it. We don't want to approach
people who make us feel bored, right?

372
00:24:02,451 --> 00:24:05,240
Because we know we're just not going to
want to be in relationship with them.

373
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:10,730
People who display more positive
emotions or who are more gentle in their

374
00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:13,310
expressions, right? They're
saying, I'm here for you. Right?

375
00:24:13,311 --> 00:24:14,990
If I walk around like
this and I might talk

376
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:22,220
right? Immediately you're thinking, oh,
this guy's not approachable. You know,

377
00:24:22,221 --> 00:24:25,310
I'm not. You've got power
issues. He's got control issues.

378
00:24:26,450 --> 00:24:29,630
The fourth is physical and mental health.
So it's interesting.

379
00:24:29,631 --> 00:24:30,950
I was in a meeting last week,

380
00:24:31,010 --> 00:24:36,010
two weeks ago now I'm with a group of
the counselors from universities around

381
00:24:36,681 --> 00:24:37,580
the state of Connecticut.

382
00:24:37,670 --> 00:24:40,730
And what the research now shows
is that for the last five years,

383
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:46,370
there has been a 20% increase in
psychiatric hospitalizations for

384
00:24:46,371 --> 00:24:47,204
undergraduates.

385
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:52,040
So it's kind of 20% a year for the
last five years with the research.

386
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:57,070
My own shows is that if we took the
indicators of stress for adolescents and

387
00:24:58,671 --> 00:24:59,960
teenagers in our nation,

388
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:03,830
they are greater than the stress levels
of the adults who are raising them.

389
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,660
So you can imagine what's going on in
our nation right now when everyone is

390
00:25:08,661 --> 00:25:13,280
having this high activation emotion,
right? Cortisol being released,

391
00:25:13,281 --> 00:25:18,080
confusion happening, and ability to
concentrate. Lots of other things.

392
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:23,780
The final piece is on
creativity. Now, Google is not
really known for that, right?

393
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:27,590
Um, how many of you believe
that creativity is important?

394
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:33,500
Good. Um, that's good news. Um,

395
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:39,880
one thing interesting that we have found
is that in our studies of young adults

396
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:46,400
that how they feel and their emotion
skills is highly correlated with their

397
00:25:46,401 --> 00:25:49,220
ability to be creative.
Well,

398
00:25:49,221 --> 00:25:54,050
we know from research is that cognitive
ability correlates with creativity but

399
00:25:54,051 --> 00:25:56,480
only up to an average Iq level.

400
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:00,560
So most people think that creativity
is a cognitive process, right?

401
00:26:00,561 --> 00:26:04,730
That the more high, the higher your
Iq is, the more creative you are.

402
00:26:05,390 --> 00:26:07,820
What happens with cognitive
abilities that it does this.

403
00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:13,910
So the question is what's explaining
the rest of the variance in creativity?

404
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:17,900
And what we're finding is that
it has to be emotion skills.

405
00:26:18,350 --> 00:26:20,360
Any hypotheses of why
that might be the case?

406
00:26:21,170 --> 00:26:26,060
Why would it emotion skills be responsible
for the creative process and product?

407
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:34,700
Great Point. So if you're
under pressure, pressure,

408
00:26:34,701 --> 00:26:37,940
pressure all the time and your kind of
default network is never able to kind of

409
00:26:39,110 --> 00:26:42,350
be activated, right? How can
you be creative? What else?

410
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:47,430
Awareness of how the thing that you're
creating is affecting you or you and the

411
00:26:47,431 --> 00:26:48,450
people who are going to buy it.

412
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:54,420
So putting emotion into the product as
well as imagining what the feelings are,

413
00:26:54,421 --> 00:26:58,690
the recipient of that product.
What else you're afraid of failing.

414
00:26:58,691 --> 00:27:02,730
You probably not going to go very
far. It's a great point. Now,

415
00:27:02,731 --> 00:27:07,320
how many of you've heard of
this concept called grit? Yup.

416
00:27:07,530 --> 00:27:11,910
So what we find in our research is that
grit is not correlated with creativity

417
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:17,430
or academic achievement, but that
the skills of emotion management are,

418
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:22,200
and I think the reason for that
is that has anyone here ever,

419
00:27:22,410 --> 00:27:25,830
how many of you have actually attempted
to be creative and have failed that an

420
00:27:25,831 --> 00:27:28,950
attempt? Yeah. Um,

421
00:27:29,070 --> 00:27:31,560
how many of you have ever
gotten negative feedback?

422
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:36,810
How many of you ever been frustrated
with your own design of something?

423
00:27:37,770 --> 00:27:39,720
Have you ever been
disappointed in your own work?

424
00:27:41,010 --> 00:27:44,730
So emotions are inherent
in everything we do.

425
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:47,910
And some people, they, boy, you
just got to plow through it,

426
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,430
but not really the case,
right?

427
00:27:50,431 --> 00:27:54,150
The more the wider base
our strategies are,

428
00:27:54,151 --> 00:27:58,470
the more effective we're going to be.
So how do you manage the disappointment?

429
00:27:58,471 --> 00:28:01,350
How do you manage the frustration?
How do you manage being overwhelmed?

430
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:04,740
How do you manage the feedback? I
mean, I get feedback all the time.

431
00:28:04,741 --> 00:28:08,310
I was doing this presentation in New York
recently as given one guy looks at me,

432
00:28:08,311 --> 00:28:12,990
he's like, you know, I know
like this stuff. And I was
like, well, I don't like you.

433
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:16,140
So like not a problem.
We don't have to work together.

434
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:22,400
I gave a talk recently at
my own university to the
surgeons in one department

435
00:28:22,861 --> 00:28:26,700
and right after my presentation was over
to sergeant stands up and I'm waiting

436
00:28:26,701 --> 00:28:29,400
for him to like compliment
me and he's like,

437
00:28:30,510 --> 00:28:35,010
what has happened to
Yale? I was like, wow,

438
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:40,470
like that's, I was like, okay, keep
going. And then he goes, this is,

439
00:28:40,471 --> 00:28:43,710
yeah,
we're about producing Nobel laureates,

440
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:47,550
not nice people.
I was like,

441
00:28:47,551 --> 00:28:50,100
you've got to be kidding me.
And then I said,

442
00:28:50,101 --> 00:28:54,480
does anybody else feel any different?
Of course it got worse as the other guy,

443
00:28:54,481 --> 00:28:57,810
he raised his hand, he goes,
I've learned in my work.

444
00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:00,030
Sometimes you gotta be an asshole.

445
00:29:01,170 --> 00:29:04,140
Then people just shut up and
do what you tell them to do.

446
00:29:05,190 --> 00:29:08,770
And I looked over at the chair of the,
this big department. I'm like, I might,

447
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:12,690
it's just like a movie being made
right now. Like where the hell am I?

448
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:16,740
So in life when we're
trying to be creative,

449
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:19,590
we're trying to do the things
that we think are important.

450
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:23,110
There's going to be a million people
that are going to get in the way. Um,

451
00:29:23,190 --> 00:29:24,240
you know,
and the question is,

452
00:29:24,241 --> 00:29:28,590
do we have the strategies to persevere
and do we have the strategies to manage

453
00:29:28,591 --> 00:29:32,130
the difficult emotions that come up for
us as we're trying to create something.

454
00:29:33,570 --> 00:29:37,170
So that leads us to this whole model
of like, what do you do about it?

455
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:42,520
And what I've learned is that if you want
to do great work in terms of this idea

456
00:29:42,521 --> 00:29:46,600
of emotional intelligence,
first we've got to get people on the bus.

457
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,210
Like,
do you believe that emotions matter?

458
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:53,620
And I'm not sure we're in a nation that
believes that how people feel matters.

459
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:58,300
I think that we're a couple of
hundred years behind unfortunately.

460
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:02,320
And you see that all the time. Like I
had a student last semester because like,

461
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:06,880
so now you're asking me to put,
plop myself on your mood meter.

462
00:30:06,910 --> 00:30:10,180
On my to do list. I'm like, yeah,

463
00:30:10,270 --> 00:30:13,360
actually if you want to take my class,
guess what?

464
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,880
You're going to be checking in with
your feelings pretty regularly.

465
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:21,220
And there's so much resistance to this
idea of like infusion of emotion, right?

466
00:30:22,210 --> 00:30:25,330
So step one I think is mindset.

467
00:30:26,170 --> 00:30:29,320
What I've learned also is that
if you're trying to do good work,

468
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:33,100
you really can't just train one person
or in schools like the third grade

469
00:30:33,101 --> 00:30:36,130
teacher is going to do this in their
classroom. It doesn't make any sense.

470
00:30:36,131 --> 00:30:41,131
It's got to be infused into the system
so that it changes the DNA in many ways.

471
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:47,950
But it's not just about the skills, it's
about the climate. So you can put the,

472
00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:51,160
you know, someone with skills
into a toxic environment,

473
00:30:51,490 --> 00:30:55,690
but then they have no opportunity to
express those skills. So in my research,

474
00:30:55,691 --> 00:30:59,710
what we're finding is that when you
simultaneously focus on the skill building

475
00:30:59,890 --> 00:31:04,660
and also creating a more healthy
emotional climate, you get great outcomes.

476
00:31:05,270 --> 00:31:08,800
All right? So that means we've
got to first develop the skills

477
00:31:10,390 --> 00:31:12,700
are they get to take a moment and
think of someone who you know,

478
00:31:12,701 --> 00:31:14,170
who is emotionally wise

479
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:21,050
that anyone know someone who you would
say is like the personification of

480
00:31:21,051 --> 00:31:25,490
emotional intelligence.
What are those skills?

481
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:29,160
What do you think? Just let's
hear real quickly, what are,

482
00:31:29,161 --> 00:31:32,870
what do you think are the skills of the
emotionally intelligent person? Yeah,

483
00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:38,000
they're a good listener. All
right. What else? Attentive.

484
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:42,680
Empathy. Curious, calm.

485
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:48,770
There was no experience. Personal
experience, state control,

486
00:31:49,310 --> 00:31:53,660
state control, time. Further response,

487
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:59,660
sense of humor.
Said again,

488
00:32:01,430 --> 00:32:06,020
equanimity,
suspending judgment,

489
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:10,520
not impulsive.
Anything else come up.

490
00:32:12,210 --> 00:32:16,160
Then a stand themselves.
So can we get more granular than that?

491
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:20,640
He really,
what are the skills,

492
00:32:20,641 --> 00:32:24,240
the underlying abilities of the emotion
and Delta was it'd be a good listener to

493
00:32:24,241 --> 00:32:28,560
being good and to be empathic, right?
Those are in many ways outcomes.

494
00:32:30,030 --> 00:32:34,290
What are the underlying
skills? Well, because of the
time, I'll just tell you them.

495
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:40,400
So we call those skills
emotional intelligence and
there are five basic skills.

496
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:44,570
The first is recognizing emotion.
A second is understanding.

497
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:47,930
The third is labeling. That fourth is
expressing and the fifth is regulating.

498
00:32:47,931 --> 00:32:52,550
So let's jump through them. Thank
you. Which is the name of my model.

499
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:56,690
This guy's good.
Recognizing emotion,

500
00:32:57,350 --> 00:33:02,350
so we understand emotion through
identifying thoughts and feelings through

501
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:08,870
paying attention to other people's facial
expressions, body language, vocal tone.

502
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:11,450
Now it's interesting.

503
00:33:11,930 --> 00:33:16,910
Not all emotion concepts
are emotions per se.

504
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:22,550
So let's try the vocal tone one. That's
a nice one. I had a stressful time,

505
00:33:22,610 --> 00:33:25,520
just so you know, getting here for, I
was in Mexico doing your presentation.

506
00:33:25,521 --> 00:33:29,420
It was a little frustrating. Getting
here could use a little compassion.

507
00:33:29,690 --> 00:33:34,690
So I like to see if Googlers can generate
the sound of compassion on the count

508
00:33:36,501 --> 00:33:40,160
of one, three, two, one.

509
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:47,970
I don't think that was universal. Just
say that was like four of you. All right,

510
00:33:48,150 --> 00:33:52,050
let's try it again. On the count of one,
the side of compassion. Three, two, one.

511
00:33:53,490 --> 00:33:58,060
Hi. That was pretty good, right?
All right, now let's here.

512
00:33:58,090 --> 00:34:00,670
Let's say you're like, I can't
stand this guy. I am disgusted.

513
00:34:01,030 --> 00:34:03,070
And the count of one
discussed three, two, one.

514
00:34:06,670 --> 00:34:10,780
Now you're like, oh my goodness. This is
like, I've never seen anything like this.

515
00:34:10,781 --> 00:34:15,460
You are in awe. Three, two,
one. That's pretty good.

516
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:20,620
Now you are feeling deep love for me.
Like just the love that you just,

517
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:24,450
there are no words for your
love on the count of one.

518
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:28,720
The sound of love. Three, two, one.

519
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:35,450
All right,
so that was different.

520
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:42,300
Was it that you were able to have pretty
good tone for compassion and awe and

521
00:34:43,331 --> 00:34:45,520
discuss,
but love was a little off.

522
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:54,450
You don't feel it that off. All
right, well we'll work on that.

523
00:34:55,740 --> 00:35:00,570
Anyone else? What do you think? I'm sorry.

524
00:35:01,530 --> 00:35:06,030
It's a more complex emotion.
It's a private emotion.

525
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:09,340
So there are private and public
emotions you think? All right.

526
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:12,890
Well some of the other ones you
mentioned were more instantaneous,

527
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:16,670
so there's a direct reaction concern,

528
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:20,590
but love is not an immediate reaction
to the last thing you said. It's,

529
00:35:20,870 --> 00:35:21,730
it has duration time.

530
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:24,160
So the question, yeah,
let's try another one.

531
00:35:24,730 --> 00:35:27,880
Let's imagine that you're looking at me
like I want this guy to come live with

532
00:35:27,881 --> 00:35:32,340
me. You are feeling desire, like
you've never felt that before before.

533
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:38,340
On the count of one, the sound
of desire? Three, two, one.

534
00:35:41,410 --> 00:35:44,010
All right, well at least it
makes me feel a little better.

535
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:48,110
It's the only way I get it nowadays,
right? I got to like ask for it. Um,

536
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:52,340
that was maybe too much
information. But anyway, the,

537
00:35:53,370 --> 00:35:58,290
so love maybe is more of a feeling,
not an emotion,

538
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:04,520
whereas surprise is an automatic response
to a stimulus that causes a shift in

539
00:36:06,601 --> 00:36:11,601
our behavior and our physiology and our
cognition where love is more complex.

540
00:36:12,211 --> 00:36:13,080
It's more of a feeling.

541
00:36:13,081 --> 00:36:18,081
But desire is more like an emotion
because there's an automatic response to a

542
00:36:18,421 --> 00:36:23,340
stimulus. So it helps us get
this language for emotion, right?

543
00:36:23,341 --> 00:36:25,620
Is it a mood? Is it a
feeling, is an emotion?

544
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:30,760
And we want to recognize all of the above.
The second is understanding of motion.

545
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:34,230
Why am I having these feelings?
Where are they coming from?

546
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:39,150
How is what I'm feeling influencing my
thinking, my judgments and behavior?

547
00:36:39,151 --> 00:36:40,650
So here's an easy one for all of you.

548
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:44,010
I'm going to ask you to
differentiate to emotions.

549
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:47,760
How many of you've heard of the
word anger and disappointment?

550
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:50,753
Good.

551
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:54,230
I want to know from you.
You've got 30 seconds.

552
00:36:54,470 --> 00:36:57,440
Make it 20 now to differentiate the two,

553
00:36:58,310 --> 00:37:03,310
what is the actual difference and what
makes someone feel angry as opposed to

554
00:37:04,131 --> 00:37:08,840
disappointment? Who feels they've
got it? We have one confident person.

555
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:12,980
All right, I'm going to go with you
in the back. What does that mean?

556
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:18,680
Okay,
so you're talking about the energy factor.

557
00:37:19,190 --> 00:37:22,820
I want to further push that to say
what's the underlying difference in the

558
00:37:22,850 --> 00:37:25,460
causal pieces of it?

559
00:37:25,490 --> 00:37:27,980
What makes you go to anger
versus disappointment?

560
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:34,060
How about you?
Okay,

561
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:37,720
back there
and anger.

562
00:37:40,410 --> 00:37:41,310
Okay.
You just get any of it.

563
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:44,850
Everything I can get anywhere
at the drop of anything. Yes.

564
00:37:45,530 --> 00:37:50,050
Anger as a physiological response.
Wash of adrenaline. All right.

565
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:53,960
Uh, I've called a nearby I
once, someone over there,

566
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:58,910
what do we think?
Let's stop the presentation now.

567
00:37:59,450 --> 00:38:04,070
How many of you are walking out of
here thinking, I got the difference?

568
00:38:06,290 --> 00:38:09,710
It's interesting, isn't it? Like these
are two words that we use all the time,

569
00:38:09,711 --> 00:38:12,290
but yet when we try to get to
the granularity of understanding,

570
00:38:12,291 --> 00:38:14,330
there are differences.
It becomes more complex.

571
00:38:15,110 --> 00:38:18,660
So disappointment has to do
with unmet expectations, right?

572
00:38:18,730 --> 00:38:23,090
I thought it was going to work this way.
I thought I was going to get the AA.

573
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:27,650
I just, everything was legit though
and I just didn't, didn't make it.

574
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:32,960
Anger tends to have a theme of
injustice or unfairness. Right?

575
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:35,920
That was not fair. How could
you say, how could you do that?

576
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:41,380
How many of you believe that there are
people who are feeling disappointment but

577
00:38:41,381 --> 00:38:43,690
expressing it in a way
that looks like anger?

578
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:49,510
What do you think happens all the time.
I was one of those kids,

579
00:38:49,511 --> 00:38:52,750
so I went to karate to become like
this tough guy. As you can see,

580
00:38:52,751 --> 00:38:55,990
it worked really well.
And um, I came home and I,

581
00:38:55,991 --> 00:38:58,810
cause I failed my yellow belt test.
I was like devastated.

582
00:38:58,811 --> 00:39:01,930
I mean it was like really not in a good
place. Come home. I look at my car,

583
00:39:01,931 --> 00:39:03,880
I hate you. How could you
maybe go to karate? I hate you.

584
00:39:03,881 --> 00:39:06,510
I'm never going to karate. I'm not
even going to call tomorrow. Uh,

585
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:11,080
and my parents did what they
knew how to do. My mother says,

586
00:39:11,110 --> 00:39:14,740
you can't talk to me that way. Go to your
room, wait till your father gets home.

587
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,380
Great father gets home.

588
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:20,290
I thought I told you never to
talk to your mother that way.

589
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:23,920
You know mark for crying out loud.
I've had it right.

590
00:39:24,190 --> 00:39:28,570
Not once did anyone say
so like what happened?

591
00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:35,670
Like how you feeling sad and so I got
punished for being aggressive but no one

592
00:39:37,391 --> 00:39:40,030
actually knew how I was feeling now.

593
00:39:40,031 --> 00:39:42,520
It could have been like it
looked like I was angry.

594
00:39:43,450 --> 00:39:46,090
It could have been one of a million
stories. One I didn't just do,

595
00:39:46,091 --> 00:39:50,170
I just didn't do all the test
too is the bull. He said to me,

596
00:39:50,290 --> 00:39:51,670
we knew where you're
going to pass the test.

597
00:39:51,671 --> 00:39:54,070
We're going to get you tomorrow
morning on the way to school.

598
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:59,220
I mean a million things could
be underneath the behavior
and what happens in our

599
00:39:59,231 --> 00:40:04,231
world is that we work or we spend way
too much time judging behavior and

600
00:40:04,450 --> 00:40:08,830
attributing emotions to the behavior as
opposed to really understanding what the

601
00:40:08,831 --> 00:40:12,910
feeling and emotion is,
which is why we need vocabulary.

602
00:40:13,870 --> 00:40:17,020
We say we have to name it to tame
it because if I'm disappointed,

603
00:40:17,021 --> 00:40:20,740
how you support me will be very
different than if I'm angry.

604
00:40:22,570 --> 00:40:25,360
Which leads to our rules
around expressing emotion,

605
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:29,350
the context,
is it appropriate,

606
00:40:29,351 --> 00:40:32,980
is it inappropriate and
many things influence that.

607
00:40:32,981 --> 00:40:37,540
Your personality influences it,
your cultural background,

608
00:40:37,541 --> 00:40:41,800
your race, your agenda,
your own upbringing.

609
00:40:42,850 --> 00:40:47,850
So I have two older brothers who are
great guys and they don't really know what

610
00:40:48,941 --> 00:40:51,970
to do. They're 11 and eight
years older than I am,

611
00:40:51,971 --> 00:40:54,730
so by the time I was like seven or
eight they were out of the house.

612
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:56,860
We have close friends now,

613
00:40:57,640 --> 00:41:01,660
but they convinced that basically what
mark does is he makes money by thinking

614
00:41:01,661 --> 00:41:05,560
in coffee shops and I was like,
I actually have a real career guys.

615
00:41:05,561 --> 00:41:09,940
Like I write papers I teach. So
I said, come on to hear me speak.

616
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:13,150
And they came to New York to one of
my presentations. First 15 minutes.

617
00:41:13,151 --> 00:41:16,430
It was like really cool. Like my two
older brothers they were looking at,

618
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:20,320
that's my brother.
About 20 minutes in.

619
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:22,880
All of a sudden I see my one
brother looking at by the religious,

620
00:41:24,490 --> 00:41:26,710
like really not in a good place.

621
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:30,880
And I realized afterwards that it was at
the point where I was saying I've been

622
00:41:30,881 --> 00:41:31,714
bullied.

623
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:34,700
It was up to the point I was talking
about my neurotic mother and my angry

624
00:41:34,701 --> 00:41:36,920
father and my two brothers.

625
00:41:39,170 --> 00:41:41,780
And so at the end of my talk, I want
us to my brother, I'm like, so guys,

626
00:41:41,781 --> 00:41:44,840
we have my brother's. He was
like, really pass. He's like,

627
00:41:44,841 --> 00:41:47,930
don't even walk out with me. I'm
like, are you serious? He's like,

628
00:41:48,410 --> 00:41:52,130
you share way too much. You're
too vulnerable. I'm like, Dave,

629
00:41:52,131 --> 00:41:55,160
like I'm the director of the
center emotional intelligence.

630
00:41:55,161 --> 00:41:57,200
Like if I can't talk about my feelings,

631
00:41:57,201 --> 00:42:00,740
no one's going to tell you about their
failings. And he's like, and I, you know,

632
00:42:01,370 --> 00:42:05,390
and, and he went on and on. Then the
last thing he said was something like,

633
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:06,313
and you know what?

634
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:08,180
Okay,

635
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:10,760
people are going to see you as being weak.

636
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:16,610
Which is fascinating to me that because
I share so much about being a victim of

637
00:42:16,611 --> 00:42:19,820
bullying and how I had all
these challenges growing
up and my parents were this

638
00:42:19,821 --> 00:42:24,100
way that that was going to make
people see me as weak. Right?

639
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:27,890
I remember looking at my one brother,
I'm like, Dave, like I don't know.

640
00:42:27,891 --> 00:42:31,950
In my department we call that
projection, right? Like I'm doing okay.

641
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:35,610
Just let you know I'm doing
all right. Um, but it shows me,

642
00:42:35,611 --> 00:42:37,590
right that we all have our rules.

643
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:38,640
Okay,

644
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:43,230
don't we? We have rules about emotion. Do
I talk about them too? I talk about them.

645
00:42:43,650 --> 00:42:46,830
Am I a hugger? I'm not a hugger.
Do I give good eye contact?

646
00:42:46,831 --> 00:42:50,100
Am I not give eye contact?
Is it cultural cause it is cultural.

647
00:42:50,580 --> 00:42:52,050
There's no doubt about it.
That was a cultural,

648
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:58,390
which leads us to the last
skill of emotional intelligence,
which is the big one,

649
00:42:58,750 --> 00:43:00,850
which is emotion regulation,
right?

650
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:05,110
What are the strategies that I have
available to me to manage it all?

651
00:43:05,111 --> 00:43:09,250
Emotions to not just downregulate
the negative ones, but the upgrade,

652
00:43:09,251 --> 00:43:12,310
like the ones that I need to
achieve a goal. So, for example,

653
00:43:12,311 --> 00:43:14,170
if you were here and you said,
well,

654
00:43:14,171 --> 00:43:16,390
I'm in the blue when I asked
you to be in the yellow,

655
00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:19,990
what's your strategy for
shifting into that place? Yeah,

656
00:43:19,991 --> 00:43:21,820
that's an upregulating strategy.

657
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:27,480
Most people's conceptions of emotion
regulation is that it's regulating down.

658
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:31,990
What we're saying is that it's
about preventing unwanted emotions,

659
00:43:32,020 --> 00:43:35,560
reducing difficult emotions,
initiating ones that you want to have,

660
00:43:35,830 --> 00:43:37,630
maintaining emotions
that are useful to you,

661
00:43:37,631 --> 00:43:41,110
that you're experiencing and even
boosting or enhancing emotions.

662
00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:44,530
And it's interesting, like
right now, if I'm stressed out,

663
00:43:44,650 --> 00:43:47,380
like let's say I'm looking at your
facial expressions and watching Danielle

664
00:43:47,381 --> 00:43:49,920
because she's like my boss here and
I'm thinking of myself, all right,

665
00:43:49,921 --> 00:43:54,650
is it going well? What do you think?
You know, I dunno. Uh, she looked down,

666
00:43:55,640 --> 00:44:00,620
oh my God. And she looked over at
her boss and she went like, Oh shit.

667
00:44:00,621 --> 00:44:04,850
Like it's never gonna work out. I can't
be like, Ugh, I've got to do yoga. Right?

668
00:44:05,030 --> 00:44:08,900
I can just start doing yoga right now
to deal with my stress levels. I mean,

669
00:44:08,901 --> 00:44:10,960
I could, but like, it's not
going to work very well.

670
00:44:13,660 --> 00:44:18,560
So I met, I could do it and
I just did a little demo, but

671
00:44:20,330 --> 00:44:22,910
I can't really do yoga in
the moment to regulate.

672
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:26,690
I've got to have cognitive strategies.
Does that resonate with you?

673
00:44:27,050 --> 00:44:30,920
So different environments call for the Di,
a different type of strategizing.

674
00:44:32,010 --> 00:44:35,580
And what I've learned in the last 20
years of running around talking about this

675
00:44:35,581 --> 00:44:38,640
stuff is that most people,
if I say to them,

676
00:44:38,670 --> 00:44:43,650
what's your go to strategy when you're
feeling this way to help you manage it?

677
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:48,480
What are you talking about? They
don't really have the language for it,

678
00:44:48,481 --> 00:44:51,750
nor do they have the tool bag
with those strategies in it.

679
00:44:52,590 --> 00:44:57,330
And it's kind of my goal is to make
sure that everybody has that tool bag.

680
00:44:57,331 --> 00:44:59,340
Because I know what it's like
to not have the tool bag.

681
00:45:00,090 --> 00:45:02,880
Has anyone here ever
experienced a strong emotion?

682
00:45:05,430 --> 00:45:08,220
Has anyone here have experienced strong
emotion that didn't regulate very

683
00:45:08,221 --> 00:45:09,054
effectively?

684
00:45:09,990 --> 00:45:12,990
And how many of you just want to live
in that space for the rest of your life?

685
00:45:12,991 --> 00:45:16,230
Right. It's not a great
place to live in. Right?

686
00:45:16,231 --> 00:45:20,730
So I feel like it's my duty to make
sure we teach these things now.

687
00:45:21,660 --> 00:45:23,490
Oh my goodness.
And then there's time left.

688
00:45:24,990 --> 00:45:27,720
So before we wrap up in
the next three hours,

689
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:33,600
I've all, I've talked to the five
skills, recognize, understand, label,

690
00:45:33,601 --> 00:45:38,460
express and regulate. Um,
now you know what they are.

691
00:45:38,820 --> 00:45:42,690
I'm going to ask you to think how
emotionally intelligent are you on a scale

692
00:45:42,691 --> 00:45:46,890
from one to five. One, you are
emotionally bankrupt. You don't have,

693
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:49,170
you can't read a person from
like right in front of you.

694
00:45:49,171 --> 00:45:52,020
You have no strategies to regulate
to five, you are really skilled.

695
00:45:52,860 --> 00:45:56,520
Where would you say you are?
How many of you give yourselves a one?

696
00:45:57,870 --> 00:46:01,320
Like you are just
emotionally like not skilled.

697
00:46:02,390 --> 00:46:06,750
We've got one semi honest person too.

698
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:13,310
Three,
four,

699
00:46:14,990 --> 00:46:19,130
five. Okay. It's interesting.

700
00:46:20,060 --> 00:46:22,640
I would say the average
and it was around 3.75.

701
00:46:24,650 --> 00:46:26,570
Um,
how do you know?

702
00:46:29,020 --> 00:46:29,853
Yeah,

703
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:34,650
I was like,
I dunno how I know.

704
00:46:36,030 --> 00:46:41,030
How many of you have got an accurate
feedback on your emotion perception.

705
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:42,353
Ability.

706
00:46:43,750 --> 00:46:44,583
Okay.

707
00:46:44,620 --> 00:46:46,630
Or your emotion regulation skills.

708
00:46:48,090 --> 00:46:48,470
Yeah.

709
00:46:48,470 --> 00:46:50,630
And how do you know that it was accurate?
The feedback.

710
00:46:53,110 --> 00:46:57,040
What's that
depends on her emotional intelligence,

711
00:46:58,600 --> 00:47:03,480
right? Think about it like who's giving
you the feedback, right? Like my,

712
00:47:03,730 --> 00:47:07,240
what's that? Yeah, that might be the case.

713
00:47:07,241 --> 00:47:11,980
Although I've had about seven therapists
in my life. Um, so it's tricky,

714
00:47:12,490 --> 00:47:16,300
right? This idea of self
awareness around emotion skills.

715
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:18,550
What my research shows by the way,

716
00:47:19,330 --> 00:47:24,040
is that the correlation coefficient
between yourself rated emotional

717
00:47:24,041 --> 00:47:29,041
intelligence and your actual
emotional skills is about zero.

718
00:47:31,030 --> 00:47:35,500
So self ratings don't go very far in
this domain because it really is about a

719
00:47:35,501 --> 00:47:36,910
skill and a mental ability.

720
00:47:37,540 --> 00:47:41,500
It's like asking someone how smart they
think they are or asking parents or rate

721
00:47:41,501 --> 00:47:44,440
how smart their kids on it.
Now,

722
00:47:46,090 --> 00:47:48,670
what I want to wrap up with for just
a few minutes of sharing you what we

723
00:47:48,671 --> 00:47:49,504
actually do.

724
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:53,080
So we know from our research that when
we measure emotional intelligence as a

725
00:47:53,081 --> 00:47:56,680
set of skills, it looks
pretty good. Less skilled.

726
00:47:56,681 --> 00:48:00,820
Kids look like this,
high skilled kids look like that.

727
00:48:02,050 --> 00:48:04,300
We know that when we work
with managers and leaders,

728
00:48:04,510 --> 00:48:06,400
more skills look pretty good.

729
00:48:07,420 --> 00:48:09,820
People like to be around
people that have these skills.

730
00:48:10,180 --> 00:48:13,690
I just did this huge study with
supervisors, emotional intelligence.

731
00:48:13,930 --> 00:48:17,080
So think about this same amount of work,
right?

732
00:48:17,081 --> 00:48:19,800
If you have a supervisor who is low
in emotional intelligence are high in

733
00:48:19,801 --> 00:48:22,570
emotional intelligence,
you're working the same.

734
00:48:24,490 --> 00:48:28,810
This side's a little complex.
But think about how you feel at work.

735
00:48:29,650 --> 00:48:32,890
If your supervisor is low
and emotional intelligence,

736
00:48:33,310 --> 00:48:37,900
you're feeling inspiration 28%
of the time if they're high,

737
00:48:38,290 --> 00:48:39,123
80%.

738
00:48:41,020 --> 00:48:46,020
So how you feel about your work and how
you feel at work tends to correlate very

739
00:48:46,211 --> 00:48:50,950
highly with the emotional
skills of your supervisor.

740
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:57,190
Look at that.
Feelings of burnout at work,

741
00:48:57,970 --> 00:49:01,210
almost triple fear of speaking up.

742
00:49:02,740 --> 00:49:06,670
So people are afraid to speak up and to
even have an opinion when they have a

743
00:49:06,671 --> 00:49:10,180
supervisor who's low in emotional
intelligence, engagement, triple

744
00:49:12,310 --> 00:49:13,990
finding purpose and meaning at your work.

745
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:20,050
So what we find is that
these skills really play out
in meaningful and important

746
00:49:20,051 --> 00:49:21,220
ways in everyday life.

747
00:49:22,090 --> 00:49:25,000
The last thing I'll share with you
is what do we do to develop them?

748
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:27,130
So you've got nature,
not nurture.

749
00:49:27,940 --> 00:49:32,170
So nature are things like your
temperament and personality.

750
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:38,080
Are any of you like me? Like people who
worry more than you'd like to worry? Yeah,

751
00:49:38,081 --> 00:49:40,420
I have that.
I was like born with the worry Jean.

752
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:45,460
I even now I live in worry about
why worry anybody else like that.

753
00:49:46,660 --> 00:49:49,320
And I'm at a point now in my
career like I worry about why,

754
00:49:49,340 --> 00:49:53,470
worry about why worry and I like
mark like you're doing fine.

755
00:49:53,471 --> 00:49:55,960
You don't think they worry about, but then
it's like, oh, something will go wrong.

756
00:49:56,890 --> 00:50:01,360
So that's my genetics. 10 Years of
therapy, 25 years as a psychologist,

757
00:50:01,720 --> 00:50:04,660
16 curriculum on emotional
intelligence and I,

758
00:50:04,661 --> 00:50:08,620
my default is who worry.
Um,

759
00:50:08,710 --> 00:50:12,520
nothing has changed my automatic worry,
which has been frustrating. I was like,

760
00:50:13,290 --> 00:50:17,110
so I've learned that that is my
temperament, right? That's my personality.

761
00:50:18,370 --> 00:50:22,360
What I need or strategies on how to learn,
how to live better with who I am.

762
00:50:22,361 --> 00:50:26,980
I can't change my genetics,
but I can change the way I,

763
00:50:27,620 --> 00:50:30,530
those feelings and how I
regulate them in everyday life.

764
00:50:31,130 --> 00:50:32,720
And that's where the
nurture piece comes in.

765
00:50:34,010 --> 00:50:38,150
It also is influenced by your
own development. So guess what?

766
00:50:38,150 --> 00:50:41,060
I grew up with a mom who would
say things that had smoked. Honey,

767
00:50:41,061 --> 00:50:45,740
you're being bullied. Don't tell me
the details. I'll have a breakdown.

768
00:50:46,330 --> 00:50:51,320
Like Ma, like I'm having a breakdown.
It's like you're my mother.

769
00:50:51,980 --> 00:50:54,890
You're supposed to have the strategies.
So,

770
00:50:54,891 --> 00:50:59,000
and I had a father who was a tough guy
from the Bronx who son get in there.

771
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:01,760
All right dad, that sounds like, yeah,

772
00:51:01,761 --> 00:51:06,020
I'm just going to get in there like
it's not going. I'll never be the,

773
00:51:06,021 --> 00:51:08,840
I have a fifth degree black belt now.
I really do.

774
00:51:08,841 --> 00:51:13,700
I mean I could eliminate anyone in this
room, but like it's not in my genetics.

775
00:51:13,701 --> 00:51:16,760
I don't like to fight. I like the
techniques. I think the movements,

776
00:51:17,270 --> 00:51:18,590
I don't want to hurt anybody.
Want to touch anybody.

777
00:51:20,330 --> 00:51:24,140
So that led me to work for the last 20
years on an approach to teaching these

778
00:51:24,141 --> 00:51:26,870
skills. And I'll just spend
very little time on that today.

779
00:51:26,871 --> 00:51:29,600
And then hopefully we can get into
more detail with some of the teams.

780
00:51:30,140 --> 00:51:31,160
We developed tools,

781
00:51:31,850 --> 00:51:34,810
we learned that you have to be in an
environment where emotions matter,

782
00:51:34,830 --> 00:51:39,410
not where rules role. So we said, why
don't we ask people how they want to feel.

783
00:51:40,100 --> 00:51:44,270
The second is a tool to build self
awareness and vocabulary and strategies.

784
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:48,860
We also realized that a lot of people
have difficulty with triggers like certain

785
00:51:48,861 --> 00:51:51,940
people and certain circumstances that
really activates strong emotions.

786
00:51:51,941 --> 00:51:53,570
So we developed a tool
called the Meta moment.

787
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:57,580
Then we realized that we're
too self focused, right?

788
00:51:57,590 --> 00:52:01,550
We'll live in a world where when conflict
arises, it's between and among people.

789
00:52:02,540 --> 00:52:07,190
So let's think about that. This is a
great principal of a school named dawn.

790
00:52:07,370 --> 00:52:10,700
This is her emotional intelligence charter
with her school in Harlem, New York,

791
00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:14,360
and they want to feel as a team
supported and respected, peaceful,

792
00:52:14,361 --> 00:52:16,610
interested in power and as did
appreciate it and motivated.

793
00:52:17,540 --> 00:52:21,320
So she has no rules in her school, just
feelings. And then they say, all right,

794
00:52:21,321 --> 00:52:22,880
well we've want to feel that way.

795
00:52:23,450 --> 00:52:27,320
What do we need to do each day
in order to have those feelings?

796
00:52:28,610 --> 00:52:30,530
What are the specific measurable,

797
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:35,810
Realistic Behaviors that we need to
do each day to create that emotional

798
00:52:35,811 --> 00:52:40,250
climate? So it shows up in many ways.
This is another high school in New York.

799
00:52:40,251 --> 00:52:43,640
They want to feel balanced and energized.
That's where I was just in Mexico.

800
00:52:43,880 --> 00:52:45,590
They'd much more creative
with their charters,

801
00:52:45,591 --> 00:52:48,620
their fifth grade classroom
here in San Francisco.

802
00:52:49,070 --> 00:52:51,880
They wouldn't feel comfortable,
confident, creative focus, ecstatic,

803
00:52:51,890 --> 00:52:55,010
respected and challenged.
List goes on.

804
00:52:55,700 --> 00:52:58,010
The mood meter helps us
build more awareness.

805
00:52:58,310 --> 00:53:00,650
So how do you build awareness of emotion?
Well,

806
00:53:00,651 --> 00:53:04,010
you can learn the facial expressions,
the body language, the vocal tones,

807
00:53:04,011 --> 00:53:07,700
the physiology and the behavior that
occur in each of these quadrants.

808
00:53:08,090 --> 00:53:09,530
You can build that vocabulary.

809
00:53:10,580 --> 00:53:15,580
There are 2000 words that we could plot
on the motivator we use to usually you

810
00:53:16,041 --> 00:53:20,570
could learn how emotions influence
your judgments and the way your brain

811
00:53:20,571 --> 00:53:22,310
operates.
So for example,

812
00:53:22,940 --> 00:53:27,090
yellow is great for creative processing
where the green is great for building

813
00:53:27,091 --> 00:53:27,924
consensus.

814
00:53:29,190 --> 00:53:32,310
You can learn strategies to help you
manage the full range of emotions.

815
00:53:33,330 --> 00:53:36,750
And you can see that schools adopt these
practices in really interesting ways

816
00:53:36,751 --> 00:53:38,430
through art work and
other things like that.

817
00:53:38,910 --> 00:53:42,090
These are working with the boys and girls
clubs across the United States now to

818
00:53:42,091 --> 00:53:43,710
build this into our
after school programming,

819
00:53:44,310 --> 00:53:47,310
we haven't built an app where you can
plot yourself on to your heart's delight.

820
00:53:49,140 --> 00:53:53,940
So last two minutes. Can I ask, I want
to just take a moment to read this quote.

821
00:53:56,370 --> 00:53:57,203
Okay.

822
00:54:00,710 --> 00:54:04,640
How many of you feel like your fuse
is shorter than it's ever been?

823
00:54:05,830 --> 00:54:06,501
I want to feel that way.

824
00:54:06,501 --> 00:54:11,420
Like your stimulus to response is
getting tighter and tighter and tighter.

825
00:54:11,660 --> 00:54:13,310
That's what we're finding
across the states.

826
00:54:14,060 --> 00:54:17,420
So we built a tool to help with that,
and we say,

827
00:54:17,421 --> 00:54:20,870
if you take our six step seriously,
now you can avoid the 12th steps later.

828
00:54:23,010 --> 00:54:25,190
So you are triggered,
right?

829
00:54:25,340 --> 00:54:30,340
Most people rely on breathing exercises
like that to help them deactivate.

830
00:54:32,210 --> 00:54:34,730
But we've learned is that there's one
more piece you can throw in there.

831
00:54:34,731 --> 00:54:36,230
We call it seeing your best self.

832
00:54:37,460 --> 00:54:40,310
What we've learned is that our nation has,

833
00:54:40,340 --> 00:54:44,300
this is a study of thousands of people.
They're begging to be more compassionate.

834
00:54:44,900 --> 00:54:48,470
They're saying that their best self
is someone who is more compassionate.

835
00:54:49,970 --> 00:54:52,700
So think about that. You're triggered
by someone at work or at home,

836
00:54:53,450 --> 00:54:58,340
you go for the automatic response. But
if you pause and say, wait a minute,

837
00:54:58,820 --> 00:55:03,470
my best self is someone who is more
compassionate. Do you think that my guide,

838
00:55:03,950 --> 00:55:07,520
how you behave following
that just all dodger heads.

839
00:55:07,521 --> 00:55:09,440
Cause that's what my research shows.
It will.

840
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:13,040
Then we have other ways we
have to manage conflict, right?

841
00:55:13,041 --> 00:55:16,280
We have to realize that it's not
just about me, it's about we.

842
00:55:16,580 --> 00:55:19,640
And we have to figure out like what
was the other person actually feeling.

843
00:55:19,790 --> 00:55:23,510
You can't do that in the moment.
You actually need time to process that.

844
00:55:24,470 --> 00:55:27,200
So let me wrap up by saying
just two last things.

845
00:55:28,310 --> 00:55:31,850
First is we've done pretty
big experiments on this work,

846
00:55:32,660 --> 00:55:36,950
randomized trials and 60 places.
And I found that in schools,

847
00:55:36,951 --> 00:55:39,460
when you do this work,
you get better outcomes for students.

848
00:55:39,461 --> 00:55:41,940
So you get better outcomes for
teachers and classroom climates.

849
00:55:41,970 --> 00:55:44,870
You get less bullying
and all that great stuff.

850
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:50,420
Can I ask everybody to take one last
deep breath with me? Not of your life,

851
00:55:50,421 --> 00:55:55,370
but just have this time together.
So to wrap up,

852
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:58,820
how many of you believe
that emotions matter? Cool.

853
00:55:59,660 --> 00:56:02,780
How many of you think that the skills
of emotional intelligence are real?

854
00:56:04,670 --> 00:56:08,900
How many of you've heard of the things
soft skills? That's how they think of it.

855
00:56:09,380 --> 00:56:13,790
What I'm here to tell you is that
your brain is replete with emotion and

856
00:56:13,791 --> 00:56:18,770
cognition. Our goal is to have those
two systems work well together.

857
00:56:19,220 --> 00:56:21,380
Oftentimes,
one has more power than the other.

858
00:56:21,650 --> 00:56:24,070
Our nation is one that
cares more cognition,

859
00:56:24,220 --> 00:56:27,220
that emotion when they're
both living simultaneously.

860
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:31,270
So the question is how do we infuse
more emotion into the cognition?

861
00:56:33,390 --> 00:56:34,223
Third,

862
00:56:34,750 --> 00:56:36,640
never too early or too late
to develop these skills.

863
00:56:36,641 --> 00:56:40,150
I promise you that never too early
or too late. There's no excuses.

864
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:42,520
I think fourth,

865
00:56:42,580 --> 00:56:46,930
there are creative ways to develop an AI
face to face and using technology. Uh,

866
00:56:47,060 --> 00:56:48,400
I've developed an APP for example,

867
00:56:48,401 --> 00:56:52,750
is one way to show how technology can
support you and tracking your emotions and

868
00:56:52,751 --> 00:56:54,850
learning over the course
of a week or a month. Wow,

869
00:56:54,851 --> 00:56:56,650
I've been in the blue for this long.

870
00:56:56,680 --> 00:57:00,310
What do I need to do to shift my
life a little bit? And finally,

871
00:57:00,490 --> 00:57:04,520
what I'll just say as my little hope for,
um,

872
00:57:06,070 --> 00:57:09,310
proselytizing moment is that,
um,

873
00:57:11,220 --> 00:57:16,060
there's so much resistance in our nation
right now to taking people's feeling

874
00:57:16,061 --> 00:57:19,680
seriously. I'm want to go to schools
and I hear teachers say things like,

875
00:57:19,681 --> 00:57:23,700
Zip that we're not friends anymore.
I'm like devastated by that.

876
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:28,710
To think that like that child is not
seen as someone who is a feeling creature

877
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:32,340
who needs to be respected
and supported and developed.

878
00:57:32,341 --> 00:57:35,240
And then you go into the workplace and
you see people that are all stressed and

879
00:57:35,241 --> 00:57:36,510
they're feeling frustrated,
anger.

880
00:57:36,511 --> 00:57:39,960
And there's not a lot of emotional
intelligence really brought into the

881
00:57:39,961 --> 00:57:40,920
workplace environment.

882
00:57:41,640 --> 00:57:46,640
So my primary interest in life is to
figure out ways that we can infuse these

883
00:57:47,061 --> 00:57:52,050
skills into the way leaders lead.
And all of us are in relationship.

884
00:57:52,110 --> 00:57:56,370
And my hope is that by doing so, we
get great outcomes, like better health,

885
00:57:57,360 --> 00:58:00,530
better relationships, more creativity, um,

886
00:58:00,610 --> 00:58:03,720
and maybe people get to achieve
their dreams. Thank you so much.

887
00:58:05,130 --> 00:58:09,100
