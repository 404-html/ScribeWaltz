1
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:11,660
Well Ron, thank you for
coming. Today we're delighted
to have mister overexposure,

2
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:13,130
uh,
at Google.

3
00:00:13,131 --> 00:00:17,480
He is the senior fellow at the Center
for American progress where he writes

4
00:00:17,481 --> 00:00:21,800
about education, uh, and founded the
center science of learning initiative.

5
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:26,420
He's here today to discuss his third
book titled to learn better mastering the

6
00:00:26,421 --> 00:00:29,060
skills for success in life,
business in school,

7
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:31,220
or how to become an expert
in just about anything.

8
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:33,800
Please join me in welcoming Mr [inaudible]

9
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:38,880
[inaudible].

10
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:43,370
So I'm up here cause I wrote a book on
the science of learning and it's gotten

11
00:00:43,371 --> 00:00:44,204
some nice attention,

12
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:48,290
has been featured on NPR and the
Atlantic wired scientific American.

13
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:51,560
And it makes it pretty simple argument.

14
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:57,740
For a long time we've assumed that
the ability to learn was a matter of

15
00:00:57,741 --> 00:01:01,310
intelligence, right? Sort of
raw smarts, intellectual power,

16
00:01:01,311 --> 00:01:02,780
sort of cognitive horsepower.

17
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:06,110
And this is what Iq tests are
really supposed to measure. Uh,

18
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:10,340
your ability to reason through
new problems to acquire expertise,

19
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:15,470
but we know now, right, is that we
can get much better at learning,

20
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:15,741
right?

21
00:01:15,741 --> 00:01:20,741
And there's specific tools and strategies
that allow us to acquire expertise at

22
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,960
much greater rates.
And in this way, right?

23
00:01:23,961 --> 00:01:28,190
We can think about the skill of
learning to learn really as a way to

24
00:01:28,191 --> 00:01:31,520
artificially improve
our, uh, intelligence.

25
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:36,320
So I first got interested in this
topic as a little kid. That's me.

26
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:41,210
And I really had a hard
time learning in school. Uh,

27
00:01:41,211 --> 00:01:45,620
was in special education.
I repeated kindergarten,

28
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:50,780
I had one experience that I
talked about in the book where,

29
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:51,530
you know,

30
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:56,180
it was a 45 minute class and math and
I managed to be unable to read my own

31
00:01:56,181 --> 00:02:00,230
handwriting. Uh, I cheated
off my neighbor, you know,

32
00:02:00,231 --> 00:02:04,310
eventually I acquired some of
the skills of, of learning. Uh,

33
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:06,110
some just sort of came to you as,

34
00:02:06,111 --> 00:02:09,730
as came to me as they come to too
many of us over time, you know,

35
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:11,360
started thinking about thinking.

36
00:02:11,361 --> 00:02:15,740
But this is really what sparked my
interest in learning overall. Right? Uh,

37
00:02:15,741 --> 00:02:19,220
and since for the past, like
20 years or so, on and off,

38
00:02:19,221 --> 00:02:22,190
I've been writing and
researching about education.

39
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:25,520
So we're gonna start a
little bit with some quizzes.

40
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:28,760
We're going to have a lot of quizzes.
What's the capital of Australia?

41
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:35,000
So I had this question posed to me.
Um, and it was embarrassing, right?

42
00:02:35,001 --> 00:02:38,300
It was like a researcher, a was posing
the question to me and I was like,

43
00:02:38,301 --> 00:02:42,110
I should know the answer to
this. Right? And you know,

44
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:46,010
I thought Sydney first, I was
wrong. Melborne I was wrong.

45
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:50,780
The answer is c as we have some
folks here who, who mentioned it.

46
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:55,390
Um, so I'm going to up the ante
a little bit here since you know,

47
00:02:55,391 --> 00:02:56,510
you guys knew quickly,

48
00:02:56,511 --> 00:03:01,511
or at least some of you knew the
answer to the of us Julia to um,

49
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:03,370
the Immaculate Conception,
right?

50
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:08,400
So the question here is what is the
immaculate conception revolve around here?

51
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:12,850
My first answer was a, was a Jesus, right?

52
00:03:12,851 --> 00:03:16,050
I mean that's sort of the
popular conception and I'll
acknowledge here at the

53
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:18,920
front end that this idea is,
is you know,

54
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,580
specific to Christianity and
within a cultural context,

55
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:24,890
but it turns out right
to the answer is right.

56
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:28,840
The immaculate conception actually stage
is all about married is not about about

57
00:03:28,841 --> 00:03:32,230
Jesus. So researchers call this
the hyper correction effect.

58
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:36,340
And what's interesting about it is the
more confident you are in your answer and

59
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:38,200
then you're shown to be wrong,

60
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:42,730
the more likely you are to have learned
and to retain that information into the

61
00:03:42,731 --> 00:03:43,660
future,
right?

62
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,980
And so what I find interesting about this
is that I think a lot of people think

63
00:03:47,981 --> 00:03:50,620
about learning and sort of think about
the brain like hits a computer, right?

64
00:03:50,621 --> 00:03:54,100
There is data out there and the data
sort of comes to you and maybe process it

65
00:03:54,101 --> 00:03:57,520
and you put it into little boxes,
right? But if that were true, right,

66
00:03:57,521 --> 00:04:00,430
if the brain function in that way, you
wouldn't have a hyper correction effect,

67
00:04:00,431 --> 00:04:03,340
right? I mean error is, would mean
that you're actually not learning.

68
00:04:03,341 --> 00:04:06,910
But what we see from something like
this is actually the more wrong that you

69
00:04:06,911 --> 00:04:10,720
think that the, the more wrong than you
are, right? The actually more that you,

70
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:14,580
that you learn. And so when we
think about this, you know, and,

71
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:17,680
and this kind of brings us to this sort
of first lesson is that learning is

72
00:04:17,681 --> 00:04:20,860
sense making, right? That it is,
our brain is not like a computer.

73
00:04:20,861 --> 00:04:23,200
And we have to make sense of the material,
right?

74
00:04:23,201 --> 00:04:26,140
And a lot of research makes this true.

75
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:29,890
And it also helps us think a little
bit about certain study strategies.

76
00:04:29,891 --> 00:04:34,540
So over the past 10 years we've seen a
wealth of evidence show that some really

77
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:38,530
common study strategies, common tools for
people to learn aren't that effective.

78
00:04:38,531 --> 00:04:41,860
So rereading right, not that
effective highlighters, right?

79
00:04:41,861 --> 00:04:45,410
Which we see in like office
buildings and schools. I work, uh,

80
00:04:45,411 --> 00:04:46,960
often in a law library.
You know,

81
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:50,050
not only do these students
have lots of highlighters,

82
00:04:50,051 --> 00:04:51,670
they have different colored highlighters,
right?

83
00:04:51,671 --> 00:04:52,870
And I didn't really want him
to go to them and be like,

84
00:04:52,871 --> 00:04:55,210
there's actually no research
behind. Behind those. Right?

85
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:58,420
Underlying is the same thing.
So on the other side,

86
00:04:58,421 --> 00:05:00,340
so what is sort of sense making,
right?

87
00:05:00,341 --> 00:05:04,300
And examples of that is something
like self explaining, right?

88
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,920
Which is sort of really
a form of quizzing,

89
00:05:05,921 --> 00:05:09,270
which is why we're going to have a lot
of quizzes as a, you know, I'm talking,

90
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:13,090
I'm up here and you know,
this is an example.

91
00:05:13,091 --> 00:05:14,680
This is a guy named Brian Ross.

92
00:05:14,681 --> 00:05:19,090
He was a professor for a long time
at the University of Illinois.

93
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:23,500
He got an opportunity to take an
artificial intelligence, a class.

94
00:05:23,501 --> 00:05:24,311
And you can imagine,
right?

95
00:05:24,311 --> 00:05:28,240
He took it with other undergraduates and
he knew very immediately like, you know,

96
00:05:28,241 --> 00:05:30,850
he stood out, right? He's
sort of older, balding,

97
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:33,040
but he really wants you
to do well in this class.

98
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:37,220
And so what he did was just engage in
a lot of self explaining basic ideas.

99
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,340
This right at the end of a page,
at the end of the paragraph,

100
00:05:39,341 --> 00:05:43,150
at the end of the sentences to explain
to yourself what exactly you're learning.

101
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:48,780
The approach shows a lot of effectiveness
in the research and for, you know,

102
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:50,140
Brian Ross himself,
you know,

103
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:53,410
he wasn't able to code as well as some
of the other students that had a lot more

104
00:05:53,411 --> 00:05:57,070
prior knowledge. Um, but he was
able to learn a lot more in many.

105
00:05:57,470 --> 00:06:01,580
He actually just simply understood a
lot more than the other other students.

106
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:03,650
And when we think about
learning a sense making,

107
00:06:03,651 --> 00:06:08,180
right as a way of sort of
actively engaging material,
you know, another thing,

108
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:12,710
uh, make sense is explaining something to
other people. So researchers, you know,

109
00:06:12,711 --> 00:06:15,530
really loved to name things
specific in psychology.

110
00:06:15,531 --> 00:06:17,420
This is now known as the protege effect,
right?

111
00:06:17,421 --> 00:06:21,410
And explains why explaining something to
someone else is actually like a really

112
00:06:21,411 --> 00:06:22,640
effective way to learn.

113
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:26,600
So an example of this is Richard Fineman
might be familiar to many of you.

114
00:06:26,601 --> 00:06:31,130
One of the most well known
successful physicist, um, you know,

115
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:35,150
sort of the modern times.
And he once had his boss,

116
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:39,950
the provost at Caltech can
come to him and was like, look,

117
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:44,450
I'm not entirely sure sort of
how half particles, uh, a bay,

118
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:49,400
uh, this form of direct
statistics. And finally was like,

119
00:06:49,401 --> 00:06:51,020
okay, you know, I'm
going to figure this out.

120
00:06:51,021 --> 00:06:55,240
I'm going to explain it to a bunch of
freshmen, comes back a few weeks later,

121
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:57,140
he's like,
I can't actually explain this to them.

122
00:06:57,141 --> 00:06:59,240
And that means we don't
really understand it.

123
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:03,020
So I really just want to make clear that,
you know,

124
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:08,200
testing yourself is a really fantastic
way to learn is a study done by Jeff

125
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:12,710
Carr. Picky. And what you can see here
is, you know, you see the study once,

126
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:17,240
this is what many of us did
in college, right? You get
some text, you read it once,

127
00:07:17,241 --> 00:07:18,980
and then you take a test.
Okay.

128
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:23,060
Repeated study is sort of the
more dilligent college students.

129
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,280
They read the text once
and then they're like, oh,

130
00:07:25,281 --> 00:07:27,440
I should probably read it again. So
they read it a second time, right?

131
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:31,130
So you can see how they do concept
mapping might be familiar to many of you,

132
00:07:31,131 --> 00:07:36,080
right? But this idea that you're
trying to create relationships, right?

133
00:07:36,081 --> 00:07:40,880
So a spokes and hubs, um, so we see that,

134
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:43,870
uh, doesn't do quite as
well as repeated study. Uh,

135
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:45,380
and then you see retrieval practice.

136
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:49,850
So retrieval practices of the word that
psychologists use for this idea that you,

137
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,620
you're just pulling things out of memory.

138
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:55,550
So what these students did was simply
to have an open piece of paper and they

139
00:07:55,551 --> 00:07:59,540
were told to recall the information that
they had just read. And as you can see,

140
00:07:59,541 --> 00:08:02,420
they did much better than
than the other students.

141
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:07,040
So we're going to go here to another quiz.

142
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:11,990
This idea is related to the
first and the question is,

143
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:15,050
do you block your practice
or do you mix your practice?

144
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:19,940
So to put this in another way, would
you, if you are playing the piano,

145
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:25,120
do all Mozart on one day all back on
the next day and then a little Chopin on

146
00:08:25,641 --> 00:08:30,560
the third day, right? Or in each
study session, do you mix it up?

147
00:08:30,561 --> 00:08:34,150
Right? So in each study
session, each practice session,
do you do a little Mozart,

148
00:08:34,151 --> 00:08:38,480
a little Chopin? Um, so I'm just going to
do a little sort of random calling you.

149
00:08:38,481 --> 00:08:42,530
What do you think mixed approach,
blocked approach, mixed approach.

150
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:44,300
It's a mixed approach
is the correct answer.

151
00:08:44,301 --> 00:08:48,230
Most students choose the sort of blocked
approach. The reason that this works,

152
00:08:48,231 --> 00:08:52,850
right? It's actually kind of similar to
learning a sense sensemaking right? It,

153
00:08:52,851 --> 00:08:56,880
it actually prevents you from bullying
to robotic in the way that that you

154
00:08:56,881 --> 00:09:01,200
practice. So this brings us to our
second lesson. You got to mix it up

155
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:02,441
for me.

156
00:09:02,441 --> 00:09:07,441
I found this really fascinating and it
gets it sort of as this bigger issue is

157
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:11,440
sort of doing something,
it's not learning right.

158
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:14,770
You don't actually get better simply by
doing something for, you know, for myself.

159
00:09:14,771 --> 00:09:16,090
A great example is driving.

160
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:19,780
I've been driving since I'm 18
I have not gotten any better.

161
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:23,320
Handwriting's pretty similar
to me. I've been, you know,

162
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:28,470
writing things right every day and I
have not gotten better since sort of,

163
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:29,860
you know,
middle school.

164
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:33,970
So I also play a lot of basketball and
my wife and kids were away and it was

165
00:09:33,971 --> 00:09:36,760
just very apparent to me that I was
like one of the worst guys, you know,

166
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:39,750
out on the basketball court too.
I took lessons with this guy.

167
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:42,700
He's played for the Harlem Globe.
Trotters name was Dwayne.

168
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,800
What was impressive to me is one, I
just, I got a lot better, not great,

169
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:50,680
but a lot better, you know,
just with like two sessions.

170
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:52,030
And it was kind of crazy to
me cause I was like, you know,

171
00:09:52,031 --> 00:09:55,180
I've been writing about education for
like 20 years and still I was sort of

172
00:09:55,181 --> 00:09:58,690
skeptical about, you know, the power of
these very basic things like feedback.

173
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:02,630
And then I started to sort of get a
lot more into the sort of science of,

174
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:04,180
of learning was like, Oh, you know,

175
00:10:04,181 --> 00:10:07,480
I should really then use
interleaving in my own life.

176
00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:09,100
It showed impressive effects.

177
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:12,250
What's remarkable about this is that
this has been documented since like the

178
00:10:12,251 --> 00:10:16,510
1970s. It's been documented
across different subject areas.

179
00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:20,650
It's even been documented in basketball
and the study from like 1972 with a,

180
00:10:20,651 --> 00:10:24,670
a group of female basketball players.
But I've little kids at home, right.

181
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:28,000
And they, uh, you know,
one of them is eight,

182
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:31,570
she's studying her division
timestables and you know how they are,

183
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:34,390
they come home when she studies
at eight time table on one day.

184
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:38,020
She studies her nine times
table, the, you know, next week.

185
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:41,440
And it's just a very clear example
that we really just don't do enough to

186
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:44,380
interleave to mix up
the way that we learn.

187
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:49,160
The other thing that's interesting
about interleaving, right, is that one,

188
00:10:49,161 --> 00:10:51,080
it needs to be in the same subject here,
right?

189
00:10:51,081 --> 00:10:54,280
If you're trying to get better at
knitting, it won't necessarily, you know,

190
00:10:54,281 --> 00:10:57,620
you're not going to interleave with sort
of coding or diving or whatever else

191
00:10:57,621 --> 00:10:59,440
you want to learn,
but the,

192
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:03,920
the other reason that interleaving is
so powerful is that it allows us to

193
00:11:03,921 --> 00:11:06,020
understand what's called the deep feature,
right?

194
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:09,290
The deep features is really what you want
to learn when you're learning and when

195
00:11:09,291 --> 00:11:11,570
you varied the surface features,
right?

196
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:15,830
You're going to understand what that basic
idea is and that allows you to engage

197
00:11:15,831 --> 00:11:18,890
in, in sort of pattern recognition.
A very simple example of this, right,

198
00:11:18,891 --> 00:11:21,680
is that you want to learn four plus
four one way would be to do it in,

199
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:26,420
in mathematical notation. You can change
the surface future's pretty easily by,

200
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:29,030
you know, doing it in a word problem,
right? Johnny comes into a school,

201
00:11:29,031 --> 00:11:30,800
he has four and you can see,
right,

202
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:35,090
we're into leaving in that way will
produce these, these much, uh, greater,

203
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,810
greater effects. This is
another quiz, quiz question,

204
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:44,180
but moment for you guys to
read it over.

205
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:02,330
So sir, uh, you guesses. So
I'm in, the key thing is to
commit to an answer, right?

206
00:12:02,331 --> 00:12:04,970
We knew from the hyper correction effect
that the more that you commit to an

207
00:12:04,971 --> 00:12:07,060
answer, the more that you're
actually going to learn. So you know,

208
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:09,260
me just sort of randomly
calling on people as in me,

209
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,270
it'd be an effort as much as you know,

210
00:12:11,271 --> 00:12:15,790
were you on all gain a little
bit more from this? Yeah.

211
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:18,310
D all of the above,
right?

212
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:22,920
This is a very key idea here and that
is a context really matters, right? It,

213
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:25,570
this could really be from
all of the above, right?

214
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:29,500
And the context in which that you read
that is really going to change the way

215
00:12:29,501 --> 00:12:33,700
that you're going to understand that
material. So it's gets us to lesson three,

216
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,860
right? You need to think
about your thinking, right?

217
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:39,220
And researchers call this
something called metacognition.

218
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:42,460
And it kind of appears in in two different
ways. One is sort of planning, right?

219
00:12:42,461 --> 00:12:44,320
And when you're thinking about your
thinking, you're thinking like,

220
00:12:44,321 --> 00:12:47,470
will I understand this? What are
the goals that I need to accomplish?

221
00:12:47,471 --> 00:12:51,600
How am I actually going to measure what
I know? Right? And then the other is,

222
00:12:51,601 --> 00:12:55,900
is sort of monitoring, right? And is this
idea right that we are sort of, you know,

223
00:12:55,930 --> 00:12:57,190
do I really understand this?

224
00:12:57,190 --> 00:13:01,240
Does this come from a dishwasher manual
or is this really sort of a, uh, you know,

225
00:13:01,241 --> 00:13:02,560
from,
from a patent.

226
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:08,020
And the key thing to understand here
is that we're all overconfident. Okay.

227
00:13:08,021 --> 00:13:09,460
If you do surveys and people,

228
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:14,520
most people say that they are above
average when it comes to driving.

229
00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:18,490
Most people say that they above average,
you know, when it comes to looks,

230
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:20,620
most people are above average.
When you asked them, you know,

231
00:13:20,621 --> 00:13:22,600
do they work harder than their coworkers?
Right?

232
00:13:22,601 --> 00:13:26,080
But we know that everyone
can be above average. Nope.

233
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:29,440
Lots has been written about the sort of
idea of overconfidence is sort of like a

234
00:13:29,441 --> 00:13:33,400
key, a notion of behavioral economics.
But when it comes to learning,

235
00:13:33,401 --> 00:13:34,690
it's really important,
right?

236
00:13:34,691 --> 00:13:39,691
Because our goal is actually to really
understand and there's so many things,

237
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:42,460
right,
that we actually think that we know,

238
00:13:42,461 --> 00:13:45,550
but we don't really know is that Mr to
me all the time it's happened to me,

239
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:47,920
you know, like once a month.
Most recently, you know,

240
00:13:47,921 --> 00:13:49,750
my kids went to Gettysburg and I was like,
Oh yeah,

241
00:13:49,751 --> 00:13:53,530
I learned about that and I could maybe
get through sort of what would be like

242
00:13:53,531 --> 00:13:56,440
the first paragraph on like the
Gettysburg, you know, website.

243
00:13:56,441 --> 00:13:59,740
But then when they ask like any reasonable
question, you know, who was the,

244
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:02,440
you know, general for
the, you know, north,

245
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:06,790
I assume we had had no idea and
fluency plays a big role in this.

246
00:14:06,791 --> 00:14:10,450
The more that you're familiar with
something and you might not, you might,

247
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:14,260
you might think that you know a lot
about it, right? Uh, but you end up not,

248
00:14:14,261 --> 00:14:15,190
which is explains why,

249
00:14:15,191 --> 00:14:19,360
like a lot of people think
that they really know how
it toilet bowl works, right?

250
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:22,410
Spend a lot of time until the bowls.
But if I were to ask you,

251
00:14:22,411 --> 00:14:23,980
and certainly most people and maybe here,
right,

252
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:27,920
really explained the what the engineering
that goes behind the toilet bowl is,

253
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:32,910
it's hard for, for most of us, the
second and aspect of metacognition,

254
00:14:32,911 --> 00:14:37,120
right, is, is monitoring, right? And
it's sort of an ancillary to the idea of,

255
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:41,420
of feedback, right? Which is
why Twain, Samuel's my, um,

256
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:45,520
basketball coach was so
effective and you know,

257
00:14:45,521 --> 00:14:48,760
really is this idea of it.
You're actually paying attention to,

258
00:14:48,810 --> 00:14:52,100
to what you're doing, right? I don't
pay enough attention to driving,

259
00:14:52,101 --> 00:14:54,650
which explains why I
am not a better driver.

260
00:14:54,651 --> 00:14:56,610
I clearly don't pay enough
attention to my handwriting,

261
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:58,520
which explains why I haven't
gotten better at that.

262
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:03,170
But even just a little bit of
monitoring can go incredibly far away.

263
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:08,510
Uh, my favorite example here is,
is a guy, a neurosurgeon in Canada,

264
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:11,780
and what he did was something very
simple. He, for every surgery that he had,

265
00:15:11,781 --> 00:15:15,910
he would just write down
what went wrong, right?

266
00:15:15,911 --> 00:15:17,710
So if he dropped a scalpel
and make a note of it,

267
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:20,830
if you miscommunicated to a nurse,
you'd note that too.

268
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:26,550
And he found tremendous
improvements in his performance,

269
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:30,280
not only over the first year that he
did it, but over a period of 10 years.

270
00:15:31,090 --> 00:15:34,630
The other thing about this
type of monitoring is,

271
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:37,390
and really feedback in general
is that it's embarrassing, right?

272
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:42,450
So whether I go to see a basketball
coach and I'm in my forties and basically

273
00:15:42,851 --> 00:15:46,090
all of his other clients are like
little kids. Like that's embarrassing.

274
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:49,360
I didn't actually really tell most of
the people that I took the basketball

275
00:15:49,361 --> 00:15:51,670
lessons with.
The neurosurgeon hadn't even,

276
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:54,160
I frankly think of much more
embarrassing experience.

277
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:58,150
He ended up dropping someone's skull
during the surgery about a size of

278
00:15:58,151 --> 00:16:01,240
someone's call about the size of a quarter
and then had to go to that family and

279
00:16:01,241 --> 00:16:02,074
be like, Oh, I'm, you know,

280
00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:07,090
I'm really sorry I dropped a
piece of your husband's skull.

281
00:16:07,361 --> 00:16:09,070
And he describes that as mortifying.

282
00:16:09,071 --> 00:16:12,430
And I think it helps us understand like
why we don't engage in enough monitoring,

283
00:16:12,431 --> 00:16:14,680
why we don't engage in enough of feedback.

284
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:16,690
Okay.

285
00:16:16,690 --> 00:16:21,490
So we have another quiz question here.
Give you guys a moment to,

286
00:16:21,491 --> 00:16:22,324
uh,

287
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,193
look at it.

288
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:29,433
So

289
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:34,380
when to give it a shot.
See,

290
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:37,050
so more than five items for a long time,

291
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:39,330
people believe that c
was the right answer.

292
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:42,640
A lot of early research on
this idea was, uh, you know,

293
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:45,990
seven items plus or minus a one or two.

294
00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:50,550
It turns out that his research that was
done in the 1950s what researchers know

295
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:54,180
now it's this much closer to
three to five items. Okay.

296
00:16:54,810 --> 00:16:58,740
So we're going to talk about in this quick
lesson and sort of remembering memory

297
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,860
and what we're going to talk
about first is short term memory.

298
00:17:03,210 --> 00:17:04,680
If we're going to go to the next slide.

299
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:08,123
Yeah,

300
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:10,060
looks like we're not going
to go to the next slide.

301
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:14,890
But what is important about this idea?
Short term memory is really, really small.

302
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:18,580
It's smaller than most people
believe that it's going to be right.

303
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,810
So this helps us understand like why
it's so hard to remember phone numbers,

304
00:17:22,811 --> 00:17:25,450
right? For a long time. The
telephone companies, you know,

305
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,690
when they first rolled
out telephone numbers,

306
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:30,510
they did it with a mix of
address and a mix of numbers.

307
00:17:30,511 --> 00:17:33,640
He would have something like a
Elmwood nine three five right?

308
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:38,640
Then the research came out by Herbert
Simon and others 1950s and they knew it's,

309
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:41,750
it's you know, seven digits, right?
So this would be a number like four,

310
00:17:41,751 --> 00:17:44,800
seven to 60, 78. Right?

311
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:48,670
And now it's clear that the telephone
companies realize that short term memory

312
00:17:48,671 --> 00:17:50,190
is even than that.
Right?

313
00:17:50,191 --> 00:17:52,800
Which is why numbers that you really
need to remember or like nine one,

314
00:17:52,801 --> 00:17:57,330
one and three, one one. So why is this
important besides telephone numbers?

315
00:17:57,331 --> 00:18:01,140
Is that everything you learn,
right? Knitting, diving,

316
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:04,830
driving.
It all goes through short term memory.

317
00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:10,560
And the thing is that short term memory
is so short that we can't hold a lot in

318
00:18:10,561 --> 00:18:13,350
it and this helps us really understand
a lot of other things about learning,

319
00:18:13,351 --> 00:18:16,590
right? It explains why educators
are so important, right?

320
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:20,250
You want something to be explained
in a way that it doesn't overwhelm.

321
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:23,070
Short term learning explains like why,
uh,

322
00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:26,460
checking your phone or visiting the
Internet while you're learning or even

323
00:18:26,461 --> 00:18:29,640
engage in like a heavy thought
process, you know, it doesn't work.

324
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:32,760
Also explains why slides, you
know, like these, you know,

325
00:18:32,761 --> 00:18:35,640
we should aim to have them,
you know, very clean, right?

326
00:18:35,641 --> 00:18:37,410
Cause they don't overwhelm
short term memory.

327
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:40,680
The other side of short term
memory, his long term memory, right?

328
00:18:40,681 --> 00:18:45,681
So you process information goes into long
term memory and long term memory works

329
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:49,020
basically on knowledge, right?
It works on, on context,

330
00:18:49,021 --> 00:18:53,220
on what researchers call schemas. And this
is important for, for learning, right?

331
00:18:53,221 --> 00:18:56,130
Because there's this debate and learning
like whether or not you should be able,

332
00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:00,990
you should learn any sort of facts. If we
can Google all the facts, right? So if,

333
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:05,070
you know, Wikipedia allows
all the information to be
free, should we, you know,

334
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:05,700
learn any,

335
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:09,330
any facts and longterm memory makes it
very clear that facts are incredibly

336
00:19:09,331 --> 00:19:12,960
important. You're my example
on this is, you know,

337
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:16,740
I can say I haven't seen or heard
Morgan get flushed it right now.

338
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:19,950
You can immediately look all those
German words up on your phone,

339
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:24,540
but it's very hard to actually make
sense of them to really fluently speak in

340
00:19:24,541 --> 00:19:28,110
another language unless you have
that basic knowledge of affects.

341
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:31,770
So really it's important that we start
thinking about facts as he sort of basic

342
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:35,070
building blocks of, of memory, right?

343
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:39,120
But they are ways for us to engage.

344
00:19:39,121 --> 00:19:43,080
And really one of the best predictors of,
you know, can you be better at physics,

345
00:19:43,081 --> 00:19:44,280
is your knowledge of physics.

346
00:19:44,281 --> 00:19:47,850
The best way to become better at
chemistry is simply raw knowledge about,

347
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:51,660
about chemistry. You know,
when we think about memory,

348
00:19:51,661 --> 00:19:54,060
there's an another concept
that becomes really important.

349
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,620
And that's this idea of spacing.

350
00:19:56,220 --> 00:20:00,690
This is an idea that dates
back to the 19th century.

351
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,220
And basically we forget,

352
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:07,250
we all forget at a very regular rate
and we often forget about how much we

353
00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:11,560
forget. And so there's something
called the spacing curve. Uh,

354
00:20:11,650 --> 00:20:13,230
my quiz on this is sort of,
you know,

355
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:18,090
how much of this specific talk do you
think you're going to remember tomorrow?

356
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:22,830
25% 50% 75% so, sir, I'm going to ask you,

357
00:20:22,831 --> 00:20:25,410
what do you think tomorrow,
24 hours after this talk,

358
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:30,000
I asked you retrieval practice, you
know, wasn't mentioned in the talk.

359
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:32,910
And what do you think is the likelihood
that you'll, you'll recall it?

360
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:41,190
What's that?
A reasonable likelihood.

361
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:44,970
So reasonable likelihood
to me sounds like 50%. Uh,

362
00:20:44,971 --> 00:20:49,360
so that is the correct answer.
What's frankly hard, right?

363
00:20:49,361 --> 00:20:52,540
Is that I'm up here and I know that
by tomorrow you're gonna forget 50%.

364
00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:56,380
If you don't revisit anything of
it within a week, it's gone. Right?

365
00:20:57,130 --> 00:21:01,930
So my favorite example of this
is a guy named Roger Roger Craig.

366
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:06,880
He comes across the spacing research
idea that we forget a very regular rate.

367
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:08,320
Um,

368
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:12,700
this was about 10 years ago and he
started creating his own software,

369
00:21:12,701 --> 00:21:17,701
then eventually uses some online
software to revisit ideas at the rate of

370
00:21:18,041 --> 00:21:20,290
forgetting, right? Sort of
right at the edge of this curve.

371
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:24,280
We know when we're going to forget
something and if we revisit that item,

372
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:26,470
we're going to remember it for,
for longer.

373
00:21:27,850 --> 00:21:31,300
So Roger Craig first develops
the software himself,

374
00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:33,730
then eventually uses an online
software called [inaudible],

375
00:21:33,731 --> 00:21:37,930
which is fantastic if you
haven't ever used it for this
type of, of, of knowledge.

376
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:41,120
And what happens is he
goes, uh, and, and the,

377
00:21:41,290 --> 00:21:44,630
the thing about Roger Craig is key to
this story is that he loves games, right?

378
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:46,000
He loves baseball,
football,

379
00:21:46,001 --> 00:21:48,100
and he watched jeopardy growing up
with his parents who he was like,

380
00:21:48,101 --> 00:21:50,470
I'm going to use the science of
learning to get better at jeopardy.

381
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:57,430
Roger Keg goes on a jeopardy for his
very first time. He goes to Los Angeles,

382
00:21:57,431 --> 00:21:58,960
you know,
he's there with Alex Trebeck.

383
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:04,230
He does so well on his very first time
that he wins the record for the first day

384
00:22:05,441 --> 00:22:07,690
amount of,
of winnings on that.

385
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:11,800
He did so well that when he went home and
was like in his hotel room that night,

386
00:22:11,801 --> 00:22:13,630
he was like, they're never
going to call me back. Right?

387
00:22:13,631 --> 00:22:17,340
Like I did so well on these types of
recalling of facts that he was like,

388
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:21,460
they're just not going to have me on
now. Uh, Roger Craig has gone back on.

389
00:22:21,461 --> 00:22:25,330
He's competed against Ken Jennings and
his sort of one of the top jeopardy

390
00:22:25,331 --> 00:22:26,310
champs.
Uh,

391
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:30,580
and it is really just using the spacing
effect to revisit knowledge at this

392
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:33,370
point of time. And it's really
incredibly powerful, right?

393
00:22:33,371 --> 00:22:36,490
And it doesn't really take huge
intervention. So in my family now,

394
00:22:36,670 --> 00:22:39,790
we don't do homework on,
on Wednesday night, right?

395
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:42,640
One thing you can do to space
out learning more, right? Is to,

396
00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:46,870
instead of doing a homework, my kids
usually have homework on Monday, Tuesday,

397
00:22:46,870 --> 00:22:49,780
Wednesday, Thursday, you know, take that
Wednesday slided into Sunday, right?

398
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:52,150
This is this key idea of just
spacing out that learning,

399
00:22:52,151 --> 00:22:55,490
allowing for that inevitable.
Forgetting a,

400
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:59,050
now I'm going to admit that this is
not made me more popular as a parent.

401
00:22:59,051 --> 00:23:01,960
It's sort of like causes dips
in my, my dad's stock, right?

402
00:23:01,961 --> 00:23:03,010
But I tell my kids like,

403
00:23:03,011 --> 00:23:05,860
you're just actually going to learn more
and it's the same amount of time you've

404
00:23:05,861 --> 00:23:09,130
spent studying, but you're going to
retain it for a lot more from this,

405
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:10,180
this spacing effect.

406
00:23:11,410 --> 00:23:16,240
So Roger Craig himself will admit to
anyone who speaks to him that like knowing

407
00:23:16,241 --> 00:23:21,040
the answer of who wrote the bridge on the
river Kwai isn't real learning. Right.

408
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:24,490
It was just sort of a fact that allowed
him to do really well on, on jeopardy.

409
00:23:25,690 --> 00:23:28,960
Then the question is sort of like
what really is expertise, right?

410
00:23:28,961 --> 00:23:33,700
Whether this is what is like mastery
and how do we really wanted to learn it.

411
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:38,530
I got really interested in ID and there's
a bunch of really fascinating research

412
00:23:38,531 --> 00:23:42,910
on this and that, you know, mastery really
knowing something is analogies, right?

413
00:23:42,911 --> 00:23:45,620
It's your ability to think
through and in systems.

414
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:50,570
So I don't know if any of you ever
listened to the, the car talk a show,

415
00:23:50,571 --> 00:23:54,380
but it's basically like two goofy guys
and people call in and say, you know,

416
00:23:54,381 --> 00:23:57,200
I have a Buick and there's
like white smoke coming out,

417
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:00,080
had a little audio clip of it.
But it basically,

418
00:24:00,081 --> 00:24:04,300
it's a colon show for car problems.
And if you,

419
00:24:04,301 --> 00:24:08,570
if you listen to the show carefully,
what they do is, is crazy, right?

420
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:12,140
They've never seen this. Some calls in,
they've never met that person before,

421
00:24:12,141 --> 00:24:14,000
right? They don't know if
they're a reckless driver.

422
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:16,790
They don't even know if there
were student or a senior citizen.

423
00:24:16,850 --> 00:24:20,790
They've never seen the car before.
Right? So they don't know like, uh,

424
00:24:20,810 --> 00:24:23,780
does it look dingy? They've never
sort of seen what the problem is.

425
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:28,370
And yet they're able to diagnose these
problems, you know, time. And again,

426
00:24:28,850 --> 00:24:31,970
so the question then is like,
how do they do it? Right?

427
00:24:32,030 --> 00:24:33,680
They do it through analogies,
right?

428
00:24:33,681 --> 00:24:37,010
If someone calls in with a a Buick and
they're saying it has white smoke, right?

429
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:40,190
They're going through their own
mental model saying, Oh, you know,

430
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:43,960
have I ever worked on Buicks before?
What's the sign of white smoke? You know,

431
00:24:43,970 --> 00:24:46,460
how does this,
uh,

432
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:51,160
how does this match up with
other experiences that we
have? And so, you know,

433
00:24:51,170 --> 00:24:53,360
when we think about sort of learning
and we think about, you know,

434
00:24:53,361 --> 00:24:56,930
what we ultimately want to do with what
we learn is to apply it in new ways.

435
00:24:57,110 --> 00:25:00,260
Making sure that you learn in a
systems approach that you learn through

436
00:25:00,261 --> 00:25:04,760
analogies that you're thinking about.
Compare and contrast is really,

437
00:25:04,761 --> 00:25:09,520
really crucial. So researchers have
found this in topics like, you know,

438
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:10,820
math.
Uh,

439
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:15,410
this is also explains the idea of
the deep versus surface features,

440
00:25:15,810 --> 00:25:17,960
uh, been able to show it in, in history.

441
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:20,390
And I got kind of excited about the
idea and was like, oh, we don't,

442
00:25:20,391 --> 00:25:23,300
I'm going to take a wine class. Don't
know that much about wine. You know,

443
00:25:23,301 --> 00:25:27,350
if you think about wine as analogies,
I should take a wine pairing class.

444
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:30,800
And what was remarkable to me
was that the pairings, right,

445
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:34,880
did give me a much richer sense
of wine. Right? So going in,

446
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:37,430
understood and was presented to me,
you know,

447
00:25:37,431 --> 00:25:41,480
how did the tenants
relate to, uh, you know,

448
00:25:41,481 --> 00:25:45,470
or why exactly does sort of a fatty
cheese reduced the sort of tendons that

449
00:25:45,471 --> 00:25:50,060
you'd find in a lot of red wines?
You know, why do, uh, you know, uh,

450
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:53,030
sweet wines like a converted from ina,
like go well with

451
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:56,210
spicy food,
right?

452
00:25:56,211 --> 00:25:59,540
But this is different than a lot of the
ways that we would usually engage with

453
00:25:59,541 --> 00:26:02,570
sort of, you know, uh, wine, right? I
think a lot of people would be like, oh,

454
00:26:02,571 --> 00:26:04,910
I need to figure out like,
what is a Pinot Noir?

455
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:07,610
Whereas the verts demeanor grown when,

456
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:11,720
if you really want to use that
information and use it in new ways, right?

457
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:14,900
You have to engage in sort of,
you know, what are the patterns.

458
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:19,290
Another example of this is, um,
uh, so the history example, uh,

459
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:23,000
that I prefer is a, you know, let's say
you want to learn about sort of war.

460
00:26:23,001 --> 00:26:26,270
You want to learn about
World War II. Uh, you know,

461
00:26:26,271 --> 00:26:29,170
you can think about sort of why did
the Germans winning World War Two,

462
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:31,730
one of the reasons red, the blitz
creek, you know, by definition,

463
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:34,640
the lightening attack was all about speed,
right?

464
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:38,000
And then you can start thinking about
like, why does speed help in wars? Right?

465
00:26:38,001 --> 00:26:41,920
One of the reasons that the Americans
lost the war in Vietnam was, you know,

466
00:26:42,090 --> 00:26:46,350
because of a lack of speed on the
other side, right? The Americans won,

467
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:50,400
uh, the revolutionary war, you know,
largely through, through speed.

468
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:52,200
And when you start thinking of,
you know,

469
00:26:52,230 --> 00:26:56,100
topics in this way and making sure that
you learn in this way, it makes for much,

470
00:26:56,210 --> 00:27:00,110
you know, a a richer sense
of, of learning. I, um,

471
00:27:01,530 --> 00:27:06,390
ended up spending some time
with, uh, uh, er doctor at USF,

472
00:27:06,650 --> 00:27:10,710
uh, and he's sort of a real expert on,
on problem solving, right? This is his,

473
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:15,030
his thing. And I watched him, uh, this
was at a medical school conference,

474
00:27:15,031 --> 00:27:19,350
but someone brought in a, uh, a case,
uh, and it was a rare case, you know,

475
00:27:19,351 --> 00:27:23,580
as a man spitting up blood and he
gave some advice around, you know,

476
00:27:23,581 --> 00:27:28,230
what is good problem solving.
So, you know, one thing that
he said, uh, was, you know,

477
00:27:28,231 --> 00:27:31,680
you need a one sentence
description of the issue, right?

478
00:27:31,681 --> 00:27:34,650
And you want it something that
you're able to, to Google, right?

479
00:27:34,770 --> 00:27:36,510
Another bit of advice I thought was great,
right?

480
00:27:36,511 --> 00:27:39,150
Is that you need to update your
background knowledge, right?

481
00:27:39,151 --> 00:27:42,990
So to go visit the Wikipedia site, right?
Make sure your, your deep knowledge is,

482
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:47,990
uh, your, your longterm
memories is rich enough. No.

483
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,750
But the other thing that
ultimately is problem solving,

484
00:27:51,751 --> 00:27:54,000
at least in this medical context,
and really when you think about it,

485
00:27:54,001 --> 00:27:57,030
any form of problem saw me. It's
form of pattern recognition, right?

486
00:27:57,031 --> 00:28:01,380
So he has in his mind different kinds
of scripts, mental models of diseases.

487
00:28:01,530 --> 00:28:04,020
And he is trying to match
that information, right?

488
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:08,040
Basically go form of analogical thinking
to match that information, right,

489
00:28:08,041 --> 00:28:12,900
with the information, uh, of the
patient that's in front of him.

490
00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:18,930
So we're going to go to the sort of
final, uh, lesson as it were. And,

491
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:23,160
and you know, what then becomes
really important is the process of,

492
00:28:23,490 --> 00:28:28,320
of revealing, of reflecting,
of revisiting. Um, so
here's, uh, you know, uh, uh,

493
00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:33,330
another quiz question for us. Uh, and the
question is, you know, should a speaker,

494
00:28:34,230 --> 00:28:36,090
whether it's me or an educator,

495
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:41,520
how long the pause should they give in
a speech to allow people to a dwell on a

496
00:28:42,210 --> 00:28:45,600
big idea, right? So should
they leave one second,

497
00:28:45,810 --> 00:28:47,580
two seconds or more than three seconds.

498
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:52,880
So how long should the pauses be when a
speaker is asking an important question?

499
00:28:53,791 --> 00:28:57,200
One second, two seconds or more than three
seconds. So I'm not asking you what do,

500
00:28:57,260 --> 00:29:01,580
what do you think? No,
here in the front. Um,

501
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:08,090
okay, we're going to go to
someone else with the glasses. Uh,

502
00:29:08,650 --> 00:29:09,483
went in three seconds.

503
00:29:12,850 --> 00:29:16,240
Let's just say that the research study
dates back to the 1980s is actually

504
00:29:16,270 --> 00:29:20,980
between three to five seconds. What's
remarkable is that three, five,

505
00:29:20,981 --> 00:29:22,390
six is actually a pretty long time.

506
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:26,880
Now I give this presentation a lot
and I talk about this quiz item,

507
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:30,340
but I actually like don't even know
bay by the research itself, right?

508
00:29:30,341 --> 00:29:34,210
Like I have not weighed in three to
five seconds. Uh, though I should have,

509
00:29:35,170 --> 00:29:37,990
because you know, for the presenter it's
actually kind of uncomfortable, right?

510
00:29:37,991 --> 00:29:42,040
It's like a good chunk of time.
But when you look at really good speakers,

511
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:44,560
speakers are very much better than me.
Like Barack Obama.

512
00:29:44,890 --> 00:29:49,890
I mean if you watch him like he speaks
so slowly and the idea there is just

513
00:29:50,171 --> 00:29:53,290
people need time to
digest this information.

514
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:56,440
Now at first glance it seems
like it's about working memory.

515
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:59,920
And to a degree it is. But there's
another thing happening here and that is,

516
00:29:59,921 --> 00:30:04,510
you know, we often think that our thoughts
and our emotions are separate, right?

517
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:07,270
Or that our body and and reason
are separate, but the, they're,

518
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:10,870
they're very connected, right? And
so we need time to, to reflect.

519
00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:14,710
So another way to think about this is,
you know,

520
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:19,040
I had two cell phones and they're
the same cell phone. This is a, uh,

521
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:22,810
uh, a nice study that was done once
and I give one of them the finger,

522
00:30:23,250 --> 00:30:24,083
all right?

523
00:30:24,510 --> 00:30:28,350
And then I wave at the same
other cell phone, right?

524
00:30:28,530 --> 00:30:31,860
I will think that the first cell phone,
even though it's the same cell phone,

525
00:30:32,010 --> 00:30:34,170
is a much worst cell phone,
right?

526
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:38,760
And so what happens is my hand giving my
phone the finger, it did the thinking,

527
00:30:39,870 --> 00:30:40,260
right?

528
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:45,260
My hand did the thinking and then I use
that thinking right and engage in it.

529
00:30:46,890 --> 00:30:51,600
So this is an incredible thing when
you, when you think about it, right?

530
00:30:51,601 --> 00:30:55,360
Like our hands aren't supposed to think,
our bodies aren't supposed to, you know,

531
00:30:55,420 --> 00:31:00,420
change the way that, that we, you
know, reasoning in this way and yet,

532
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:03,930
and yet they do. And this explains
you and I think, you know,

533
00:31:03,931 --> 00:31:06,570
they're in other contexts,
we kind of know this idea like,

534
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:09,870
so in the creativity space, and people
love to talk about that. Like, you know,

535
00:31:09,871 --> 00:31:13,590
you're in the shower and you have that
moment of recognition, but we need them.

536
00:31:13,890 --> 00:31:15,930
The same thing in the, in
the learning space, right?

537
00:31:15,931 --> 00:31:19,710
We need these times to reflect,
right?

538
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:24,630
We need these times to a process,
this information and allow in many ways,

539
00:31:24,631 --> 00:31:28,540
right? Our emotions to become
attached to them. You know,

540
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:32,250
the other aspect of reflection, I
mean, and we can do this ourselves,

541
00:31:32,310 --> 00:31:34,740
this form of reflection, right?
So some of it explains, you know,

542
00:31:34,741 --> 00:31:36,930
why we want safety when we're learning,
right?

543
00:31:36,931 --> 00:31:40,590
We see this as really
important in schools. There's
also explains why sort of,

544
00:31:40,591 --> 00:31:44,340
you know, moments of solitude or it can
be really important for learning, right?

545
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:47,700
It also explains, um, you know,

546
00:31:47,830 --> 00:31:48,663
w w w

547
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:54,910
why just even writing about something
is a very powerful way to learn.

548
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:55,781
And we see,
you know,

549
00:31:55,781 --> 00:31:58,990
experts who really like hone on
getting better at their craft.

550
00:31:58,991 --> 00:32:02,050
So Pat Metheny is a famous jazz guitarist.

551
00:32:02,110 --> 00:32:05,920
Some of you might be familiar with him,
you know, really one of the world's best.

552
00:32:05,921 --> 00:32:07,210
And after every concert,

553
00:32:07,390 --> 00:32:11,830
he'll just spend a good chunk of
time just writing about what worked,

554
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:16,420
what didn't work, engaging in this,
in this type of reflection. I'm,

555
00:32:16,421 --> 00:32:20,320
the other thing about this
type of reflection is that
it also allows us to check

556
00:32:20,321 --> 00:32:22,570
our work. Right now this allows us to, uh,

557
00:32:22,630 --> 00:32:26,770
engage in kind of the metacognition and
make sure that we're, you know, not,

558
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:31,630
not too confident. You know, what's
weird about kind of giving this,

559
00:32:31,631 --> 00:32:33,990
this type of talk is that,
you know,

560
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:38,080
the messages that they often really boil
down to are not ones that I think many

561
00:32:38,081 --> 00:32:42,590
people want to, right? So why
don't we does that. Learning
isn't really fun, right?

562
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:47,240
And when you see a lot of gains that
promise you can like learn secretly,

563
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:51,320
uh, that, you know, learning is
going to be fun. And you know,

564
00:32:51,321 --> 00:32:54,140
the research actually suggests that
it's the other way around, right?

565
00:32:54,141 --> 00:32:58,400
So one of the reasons that interleaving
is in a powerful way to learn is that it

566
00:32:58,401 --> 00:33:03,330
actually makes learning a little bit
harder. And I think an alternative way to,

567
00:33:03,490 --> 00:33:04,550
to think about this.

568
00:33:04,551 --> 00:33:08,570
This was a math professor at Princeton
and I was talking with him and he was

569
00:33:08,571 --> 00:33:11,570
like, yeah, you know, students today,
ours is saying, you know, learning is fun.

570
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:15,800
The much better way to thinking about
it is that learning or math is fun and

571
00:33:15,801 --> 00:33:17,960
that's what makes it hard.
Excuse me.

572
00:33:18,950 --> 00:33:21,230
Math is hard and that's what makes it fun,
right?

573
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:25,790
So that you're engaging in these
types of difficulties is actually,

574
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,630
you know, what, what makes
it enjoyable and you know,

575
00:33:29,631 --> 00:33:33,080
to give other examples of the way that
this type of like active sort of harder

576
00:33:33,081 --> 00:33:37,430
processing, right? It's also just so easy
to slip in these more comfortable ways.

577
00:33:37,431 --> 00:33:39,920
Right? Whether we're using
highlighters or, or rereading.

578
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:43,370
I had this experience myself a few weeks
ago where I was like preparing for a

579
00:33:43,371 --> 00:33:48,170
talk and I like had my notes
in front of me and you know,

580
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:51,170
I was just like, I really wanted
these notes and I kept, you know,

581
00:33:51,410 --> 00:33:53,810
basically rereading them and they
were uncomfortable to me. Right.

582
00:33:53,811 --> 00:33:58,040
It was like a topic I hadn't spoken about
a lot and it was really the opposite

583
00:33:58,041 --> 00:34:00,870
of sort of better learning. Right.
I'm much better off, you know,

584
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:04,990
putting the material away and
engaging in that way. Right?

585
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:07,790
A another way to think about
this as sort of repeat backs,

586
00:34:07,850 --> 00:34:10,910
sort of a management tool, but it's
essentially a form of active learning.

587
00:34:11,130 --> 00:34:14,960
You know, I've done it. Um, now often
you know, with, with my wife, right?

588
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:17,770
Is that if you give someone some
instructions and if they're, you know,

589
00:34:17,810 --> 00:34:19,850
more complicated instructions,

590
00:34:20,090 --> 00:34:24,650
you want them to repeat that
information back to you, right?

591
00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:28,690
That's another way of sort
of engaging this a form of,

592
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:32,870
of active learning. I think, you
know, the other thing that sort of,

593
00:34:32,871 --> 00:34:36,320
this key theme here is zip forgetting
can really be your friend, right?

594
00:34:36,350 --> 00:34:41,100
We often think that forgetting works
against us, right? But you know,

595
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:44,060
forgetting actually allows us
new forms of perspective, right?

596
00:34:44,061 --> 00:34:46,340
It allows us to engage
in more systems thinking.

597
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:48,650
The key thing to also
understand about forgetting,

598
00:34:48,830 --> 00:34:50,420
and this is a weird concept to understand,

599
00:34:50,421 --> 00:34:52,250
is that you actually don't really forget,

600
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,120
there's some fun studies on this is
that if I go to you and say, you know,

601
00:34:56,121 --> 00:34:58,010
can you remember your
high school locker number?

602
00:34:58,011 --> 00:35:00,380
I think most people would be
like, Nah, I can't remember that.

603
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:05,630
But if I show you four digits, right? Or
excuse me, four options. And of those,

604
00:35:05,631 --> 00:35:06,050
you know,

605
00:35:06,050 --> 00:35:10,400
one of them is your high school locker
number for more than a one might guess.

606
00:35:10,401 --> 00:35:13,720
And certainly a lot more than average.
You're actually able to, to, uh,

607
00:35:14,030 --> 00:35:18,140
identify that number. So the question is,
if you are able to remember everything,

608
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:22,010
you know, how, how do you
actually remember something
and turns out, right? It's,

609
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:25,070
it's the retrieval, it's pulling
things out of memory, right?

610
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:27,300
Is that makes them more available,
right?

611
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:29,840
And this explains why these
more active types of learning,

612
00:35:29,841 --> 00:35:32,630
whether explaining to yourself or
explaining it to someone else can be so

613
00:35:32,631 --> 00:35:37,010
effective, right? They allow
you to see these types of
connections, but then again,

614
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:40,740
they allow you to have things
sort of a top of mine, right?

615
00:35:40,741 --> 00:35:42,140
They allow you to exist to them.

616
00:35:42,690 --> 00:35:46,290
And I guess my parting thought in
this regard is, you know, always,

617
00:35:46,350 --> 00:35:49,290
always look for patterns, right? You know,

618
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:53,880
it's so easy to look for this
very specific bit of detail,

619
00:35:54,150 --> 00:35:57,390
right? So if you're learning about oceans
as an example, right? You'd want to know,

620
00:35:57,391 --> 00:36:00,630
okay, you know, what's the
temperature of the ocean, right?

621
00:36:00,631 --> 00:36:04,140
But if you're engaging in these types
of analogies, you're starting to think,

622
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:08,160
or this types of systems thinking,
you're going to say to yourself, okay,

623
00:36:08,161 --> 00:36:11,370
what happens when the water
temperature goes up? Right?

624
00:36:11,371 --> 00:36:13,440
One of the things that happens
is more vapor is produced.

625
00:36:13,441 --> 00:36:16,620
This helps us understand why climate
change can be so dangerous, right?

626
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:20,220
To some of the storms or more a terrible,

627
00:36:20,310 --> 00:36:23,700
but this also helps us then understand
why sea levels are rising, right?

628
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:26,910
Because the relationship between heat
and water is such that, you know,

629
00:36:26,911 --> 00:36:31,860
water expands as it grows.
Bigger analogies though are difficult,

630
00:36:31,861 --> 00:36:35,700
right? And when you're using analogies
using this type of, of systems thinking,

631
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:38,070
you want to have analogies
that you know well, right?

632
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:41,880
So the analogy of like it cuts like a
knife works because we're all pretty

633
00:36:41,881 --> 00:36:45,390
familiar with knives and
analogies in this same regard,

634
00:36:45,391 --> 00:36:48,120
is that if you're explaining
an idea to someone else, right?

635
00:36:48,121 --> 00:36:51,540
Sort of like you want Uber for
kindergarten or Uber for cooking, right?

636
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:55,440
You're using an analogy that,
that all of us are familiar with.

637
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:57,540
And then the reverse side is that,
you know,

638
00:36:57,570 --> 00:37:00,900
these analogies that don't work are either
sort of quiz problems or they're just

639
00:37:00,901 --> 00:37:03,300
playing the funny, and I'll leave you
with that thought, which is, you know,

640
00:37:04,530 --> 00:37:09,090
what is, uh, you know, Barack Obama
and Mount Kilimanjaro have in common,

641
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:13,410
you know, it turns out to
be Africa. So with that,

642
00:37:13,470 --> 00:37:17,790
I'm going to thank you again for taking
the time to come out here today and

643
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:20,040
listen to this,
and thank you again.

644
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:24,710
[inaudible].
