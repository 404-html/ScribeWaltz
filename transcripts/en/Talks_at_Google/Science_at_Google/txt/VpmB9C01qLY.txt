Speaker 1:          00:06          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:12          delighted to be here today. And thank you so much for coming. It's a great audience. And I hope I'll introduce you to a subject that I've been interested in for most of my adult life and have tried to distill into this little book. Um, it's, I've got a coauthor who was actually a student of mine, uh, Katy von [inaudible] who works in the u s and so we tried to make sure that the book wasn't just a UK based book. She's bought in some ideas, particularly she's also Dutch, so we've got the European and the U S perspective. Um, so she's, she's a, she works in the, in the u s at the moment. So I, I'm going to try and just briefly introduce you to this area. Um, it's, it's a, it's covers a range of, of, of, of specialties, but I'm going to tend to speak from my own experience, which is inevitable.

Speaker 2:          00:58          Uh, I'm, I'm, um, I've, I've worked as a clinical psychologist originally training just to work in, in, in clinical work. But in later years I found myself being more interested in research and then eventually in teaching and training. So my last post, the last 20 years has been running the, the doctoral training course in Oxford to train new clinical psychologists. And as such, I had to have a kind of overview of the whole subject and hopefully was then therefore in a good position to write this very short introduction as you know, 35,000 words. And I worked in the air for about 40 years, so we bought a thousand words per year of my life went into this book and therefore it's quite crumbed. Um, so what I'm going to try to do is really talk to you about what it's about and what we're trying to do as clinical psychologists.

Speaker 2:          01:48          And I suppose the best place to start is if you like what I often say to my own family and to myself, which is, it's actually tough being human. Being a human being is difficult. We haven't so many differences and difficulties to deal with in our lives. Complex feelings, emotions, desires, challenges throughout life, managing other people, managing ourselves, managing the world around us. So I've always been interested in how do people do this, how do people tick and what happens when it goes wrong and have always been difficult is in life. We are not unique in finding life, sometimes problematic. If you've never experienced emotional difficulties or relationship difficulties in your life, then you're incredibly lucky and I think you'll probably quite rare sooner or later in your life there are things which go wrong and I'm not going to talk in great depth about any individual case, but later on in my talk I will talk about a couple of examples of people I've worked with.

Speaker 2:          02:46          But it's tough managing all the things you have to do, your ambitions, you need your family or parents pressures and the world around you. And that's always, I say always been the case, not just now in in in the century, but in many hours, centuries. We know that there's the has always been different. Not everybody finds it easy just to get on happily in the world that they're born into and they've always been ways societies had to offer people somewhere feeling better about themselves and other people. When people find things difficult, and I've just listed historically arrange of ways in which society has offered people who are struggling a bit and there are many ways of dealing with the stress of [inaudible], right? So start off as a law. People who behave differently or oddly we deal with them legally, we put them in a class. Maybe that's somebody who's got, who's behaving badly.

Speaker 2:          03:36          We put them in prison, we put them away somewhere. So the law deals with people and this to this day when people start behave Bevin strange in the street or something happens, which is challenging, we may call the police or a lawyer to deal with that. That's one way of dealing with people who are behaving differently. Another way of course is medicine and medicine has always been a place nowadays we tend to turn to if you are unhappy currency or GP and maybe they can find some way of helping you with that. Other ways include religion and somewhere that if you like you can go and see a priest. And typically and historically these three uh, three methods, the law, medicine and religion have been where the people dealt with feeling low feeling, having difficulties, children behaving, her challenging, behaving in ways which we want to change those if you like.

Speaker 2:          04:24          Those are the big ways in the past, people that dealt with difficulties. I've also put magic there because again, another approach is for example, using astrology or some other sort of technique to deal with people who are behaving strange or feel bad about themselves. And to this day you could look up in [inaudible] astronomical science and look up what, what read the future. People still use us the way of making themselves feel better when they're not happy. I mentioned politics there again cause such changing society is another way of trying to change people's emotions and, and, and ability to get on with life if like those have been the big ways in which in the past we've dealt with distress but increasingly and certainly since the 19th century, people try to understand the mind to Perth, try to understand what's going on inside our heads and the science of psychology has developed.

Speaker 2:          05:11          And that's the background to clinical psychology. And I will just briefly mention what that is and if you, um, psychology is now the most in demand undergraduate course in the UK to do your, to do your degree in and it's the most competitive one most competitive degrees to do. And it's a site, it's a study of human experience and behavior. And very quickly I've run through some of the things that happens within psychology in order to become a clinical psychologist. You studied this first and the kind of things we'd study is how is it, we learn things, how we, our memory works and importantly how we forget things. That's very important part of the system. What stress does to us and how we are different from other species, how hormones operate on us and how, for example, drunks called work on the body and the mind, why do we sleep, why don't we sleep?

Speaker 2:          06:02          Um, and what it is, how the perceptual system works, how the brain sees fields and our emotions, work perception, how perception works, how we are, how we recognize people and how we attend to other people, to anything else and how we make judgments. So the whole way in which the brain works is the subject of psychology. And as a science, it's really quite recent, maybe two, 200 years or so. But the most progress has been made within the last 50 years. Other things psychology does is why we have emotions, what we feel and particularly child development, how children learn, how to, how they learn social behavior and language and how people attach to one another. Now important relationships are how children's separate, when they eventually do what that process is more important, important it is and what the effects of aging are. How we get along, how we behave differently socially with other people.

Speaker 2:          06:54          And how groups differ from one another and why we get on without the, how we get along with authority. There's just a sampling of what you study in psychology. So that incentive, you might have done a psychology degree. This will be familiar to you and this is the equivalent as in medicine. I studied genetics, physiology, anatomy. So if you want to be a clinical psychologist, you do all this first so you have a notion of how the human mind works and how people behave. So that's our bread and butter. So that if likes a degree that I originally studied, but I was most interested in what would it all goes wrong when people are unhappy and what happens during the periods of life for most of us have some challenges. What can we learn in the same way as when you do anatomy and physiology and genetics if you're a doctor, if you're on some that, when, what is it when it doesn't work?

Speaker 2:          07:43          So clinical psychology, which is the same. My interest is the application of psychology in clinical settings where people have emotional, own psychological difficulties and these include hospitals in particular mental health and but also child health and also or clinics where the people present with psychological distress. So clinical psychologists work in a variety of different places. My early years in the 1970s eighties was working in psychiatric hospitals, but people also work in general hospitals, so works across the lifespan from infants. So how people may have difficulties in early relationship attachments and things like adoption and some of the kinds of difficulties that children can experience and the relationships when early bird were between parents and babies through to the very old and the 12 process of letting go of life at the end of life. Now we will, as clinical cycles, you work very closely with medicine and I mentioned the training to become a doctor.

Speaker 2:          08:44          One of the things you can do, I mean, I, if you know all this, forgive me if I'm telling you stuff you know, but just in case, um, one of the specialties within medicine when you've done your basic training, you can choose to do with psychiatry. Now psychiatry is different from clinical psychology in that to be a psychiatrist, which in fact our daughter is, you have to do medicine first. So she's done the whole business of anatomy, physiology and all that stuff, which I didn't do. So she's very familiar with and psychiatrists know about how the body works and their treatment of mental health problems tends to be oriented towards the physical. So for example, the treatments psychiatrists tend to give if you say so if you're suffering from depression or stress and you go see a psychiatrist, they will tend to, first of all, they'll do a very thorough physical examination and they will may well give you some medical treatments, some of the antidepressants or some other sort of physical treatment for your condition.

Speaker 2:          09:39          Now, I'm not qualified to do that. I'm not a doctor. I wouldn't do that. But I work very closely with doctors so that we will see people where perhaps medical treatment isn't appropriate or it's not thought to be helpful. In this case where we have a close relationship, we cross refer to one another, but we have a different treatment. Our trip is psychological, not physical though I'm very aware. Of course we have bodies and therefore Homans and things are important and and and drugs do have an impact in deed. There's nothing wrong with, with psychiatric treatments like like antidepressants, they can be used very much with psychological treatments. So we worked together, so particularly psychiatry and we offer different perspectives. So by and large the model and lung psychiatry underlying it is a physical one, which is something wrong with your hormone balance or with the endocrines or the the brain chemicals.

Speaker 2:          10:32          So you can fix it with a match with medication. Whereas will understand when people have distress, depression or personality, relationship difficulties or children behave challenging ways or families breakdown. There isn't an illness. It's happened to you though. That's convenient label. It's not an illness. It's a complex human response to trauma or challenge or difficulties. So what's wrong with you is while we can treat it medically and often those treatments help. Interestingly they do help. The cause may be something else. So by and large what we do is help people to develop solutions to their problems rather than if it come and find a medical way of fixing it. But again, we do work with doctors and if you do have depression, often the very first useful thing to do is to try antidepressants cause we know they are effective and if they're effective, fine cause you can get back to work and that's great but if it doesn't fix it or you don't want to use antidepressants, often a psychological approaches, that is the next step.

Speaker 2:          11:31          To complicate matters, many psychiatrists also used psychological treatments. Uh, so they will use the methods I might use but I won't be prescribing because that isn't my background. So we do work with them, but our specialties, the psychological, based on all that research, all that knowledge do with how people think, how people perceive, how people develop, all that stuff I mentioned earlier, which is our kind of basic stuff. So we work with people trying to develop a solution to the problem and based very much on the collaborative relationship. So patients are referred to clinical psychologists usually because they go to see their GP or somebody suggests they may be, they need a bit of help perhaps cause that they've got difficulties in the family. The child is repeatedly challenging or difficult or the child's very anxious or perhaps the adult you will me. And it's very much like all of us could be in a situation, feel, uh, feel depressed or anxious, have difficulties in our relationships or maybe granny is getting more and more challenging to us living at home with us.

Speaker 2:          12:32          We didn't quite know how best to help the family to adopt the fact we've now got granny living with us. And that's difficult with also got a teenager who, who, who wants to go out drinking and all sorts of problems. There's a human problems which aren't illnesses. Can we find a way of solving it? And we very much work with people who bring their problems to us and tell us about the main conference because it's confidential. And, um,W and collaborative we is, ethics is very important to us. So we have a very strong ethical code. We are regulated by the Health Professions Council, uh, which is like the General Medical Council. And we also have, um, a professionalization of the British psychological society, which has codes of ethics that we have to abide by. And these specify very clearly we're there to help the patient, not ourselves. And that's important because typically what happens is that a patient will come see me, see me and I should mention I've mostly worked with adults will come see me with a problem or difficulty and will trust me hopefully with telling me some very intimate personal things.

Speaker 2:          13:35          And My responsibility is to help them the best I can solve their problems. Not to like not because I think I've got the answer. Uh, I can't say, oh, well if you voted labor, your problems will be solved. That wouldn't be my responsibility. Um, I've got to help them work out the solution. And if you like this little cartoon summarizes it, um, we're encouraging people to become involved in their own rescue. Uh, I don't think that's very ethical there. There that might is busy reading his comic, but one of the persons drowning, we wouldn't quite do that. We certainly don't come up with answers for people because there isn't any point in that we don't have an answer. We help people to think differently and to help them to see how they got into the flight, into the situation they're in when they're feeling muddled or they're feeling upset.

Speaker 2:          14:19          So it's a color where our help, I feel like we work with them to, to, to change the situation. So the kind of people are going to see clinical cycles. You see the typical clients, peoples with phobias or fears which are very common or anxiety. Um, these are the in ways some of the easiest problems to solve. If you've got a fear of, of lifts or Wasps or spiders or cliffs or something, airplanes, there is quite relatively straightforward difficulties and often that's to do with people over longterm, avoiding, discovering those things are actually quite harmless. So that's, that's a, that's a very common difficulty. Very common monks, children, people often grow out of them. But against people and get stuck. People with depression, that's more complicated problem and the lots of reasons why you might experience depression. Life is challenging for you. We can't solve that.

Speaker 2:          15:08          Life is difficult. Life is tough. Remember I said we can maybe help you to understand the ways you've tried to solve your depression are paradoxically not helping you. Um, so things like relationship problems, people who've got against stuck in things which are difficult, needs another perspective. People with eating disorders and psychosis, psychosis if um, is a, if you like how we tend to use the term now, Robin, schizophrenia or manic, manic depression, those are words we tend not to use so much now because we're much more thinking about what's going on in the mind. Psychosis is disordered thinking. We're starting to understand it better now. Um, based on lots of good, very good psychological research, but very serious mental health problems, which are very challenging and very disruptive to people's lives. People who have long term difficulties in the past used to be hospitalized, but now we have better ways of managing it together with psychiatrists who have better drugs to help.

Speaker 2:          16:04          Also people physical illnesses like cancer, stroke or spinal injury. If you have a life threatening illness, it affects the way you think and feel inevitably and children with a range of family and individual. Um, uh, disorders of different types. Um, difficulty in relationships, school refusals, disruptive behavior in the family or child anxiety, which is very common. And people with brain injuries and developmental disorders, all of which have a psychological component. You can't just have, say diabetes or stroke or heart disease without it also affecting how you think and feel. So we use a number of models. Some of you have heard a CBT that's very common. Now the cognitive model says the thing that's let's pay attention to when there's a disorder on happiest. It's how you think. So we think we look at how it is your understanding, your perceptions of what's going on.

Speaker 2:          16:57          Um, the underlying idea here is that sometimes people can understand something in a particular way, which leads them to a particular emotions. And what's difficult is the way they're thinking when you are depressed. For example, we know when people suffer from depression, they tend to think in more concrete ways. They jump conclusions, they'll see things in more black and white, which can lead you to make assumptions about the world. Um, and I'll come back to them in a in, in a minute, but that can lead, that can aggravate your low mood. So when we're walking with working with depression using a cognitive model, we try to help, help, help people to see how their thinking is actually unhelpful to them. Behavioral people. We'd use treatments, for example, say with children whereby people, we help people to train how they behave. And again, that leads to different consequences.

Speaker 2:          17:46          CBT is a combination of behaviorism and therapy, which is increasingly popular. A lot of evidence suggests it's very effective. Psychodynamic, this is more fraudulent thinking. Try to understand relationships in particular attachments, difficult difficulties. People have the attachments or what I call systemic. This is trying to [inaudible] system around you perhaps at work or in your family is aggravating or difficulties. So we'll use all these models. The way we work is, is I feel like a series of stages. First of all the person has assessed. So a person seeing me, I lost them about what's happening to their lives. Uh, what's happened to them, what, what, what's the history of the problem? What's going on in your life, who's in your family, are you working, what else is happening to you? So we might use questionnaires or just talking to somebody. We might pay attention to how they are in relationship with us.

Speaker 2:          18:35          So our a very challenging or they very passive to a pay attention to those things in if like in the room, in the assessment room will then come up with a formulation which is a bit like the diagnosis in medicine and in particularly interested in the predisposing factors. What, what, what, why does this person have this problem here and what is something in the background, perhaps they come from a background where people, branches and the family. What precipitated, what happened last week or a month ago that led to it happening now and what is the presenting problem? What's going on, why is it staying there? Why is it purple? Why is it perpetuated? Why haven't people, people don't want to be sick or ill unhappy? Why is it going on? What's what's going on? Why is it perpetuating? And if you'd like, what is going on? We should protect in them in their lives.

Speaker 2:          19:20          Everybody has some good things. So have they got good relationships? Have they got good job? Have they got something somewhere, which is also helping them to manage. So we need to know all of that. We then come up with a formulation, which is a trial, which is like a diagnosis and I'll show you some formulations in a minute. We then do w in agreement. We'll draw up a plan to intervene to change things. For example, if we use a cognitive model, we might say we might set about a series of cognitive experiments, helping them to think differently about what of the problem is or behavior. We will, again, we may set up against mental experiments to do with the person. Uh, there's just an example. Someone who's frightened of going up and down and lifts. They're frightened or some catastrophic will happen. Very scared to go near left you, uplevel let's, you'd have to walk up and down the stairs every day, be a pain.

Speaker 2:          20:06          So what we will do is help the person who's very frightened. This first of all, watch me going up, trusting me. I'll go up and down and lift that, watch me doing it. Then eventually we'll stand inside the left without closing the doors and I'll get used to that. Next time we'll go inside. Perhaps they'll go up together on one floor, which is very scary, but I'll be with them, helping them to relax, helping them to experience less tension. And then the next time we might get them to go up three floors and finally it got on their own, up and down. So that would be very simple. Behavioral treatment. If it's relationship problem, it's not quite as simple as that. Um, as you can imagine. But we would come up with some other ways of, of suggesting an alternative within evaluate. Did it work?

Speaker 2:          20:47          Didn't it work? If it didn't work, go back to square one, try something else. At the same time we're doing with search because we want to make sure we have the right treatments for the future. How we tend to turn work will, it takes about eight years to train, see somebody. So I said to go in psychology first, then we don't like to take somebody straight off because they're very young and a little bit exit experienced when you're 21 so we often ask them to come and get some work in the workplace. May Be in hospitals or somewhere where they're working with people and make sure that they get bit more experience. We then do a three year doctorate, so that's why it's around eight years altogether, which is what my last job is doing that to train people. Our model is want landline is science practitioner and I was, you're practicing, we're not in labs but we are using notion of science because we test something.

Speaker 2:          21:32          Does it work? Doesn't it work? If it doesn't work, we try something else. We're always measuring has it worked? What's the outcome? We get people to fill in, questionnaires, drive them mad, but we need to do that to make sure we are on the right lines. And we use research based evidence trials which indicate what's what works and what doesn't. A lot of a role for that. We spend a long time reflecting, we need to make sure we're behaving ethically and we're aware of the context of what's what people want to do in one context with them. With one ethnic grouping might be different for another one. In the UK, this is pretty much based in the NHS. We've, we're fun, we're trending is funded in the NHS in the rest of the world. It's very different people, very much self fund the training and work privately as a little bit of private work in the UK increasingly.

Speaker 2:          22:17          But I've never worked private myself. I spent all my life in the NHS or in academia. Um, if you want to see a clinical psychologist, they do advertise them increasingly working privately. Um, we normally it's people referred by GP or another medical specialty. So for example, a renal specialist might say, this person is having difficulties adapting to the needs on dialysis. Can you help them? Or this person's had a brain injury, let's work with them with a farmers to help them back to normal life. And it's typically based on a series of sessions over several months. So as the course of treatment might be six months or whatever, or less depending on what the problem is. So I'll come up with the calendar and, and I'm just going to show you a formulation. This is a bit tricky, but we often don't diagrams. So I want you to have a look at this person here.

Speaker 2:          23:05          The very bottom, this diagram, if you can see this person, and this is a case taken from an from book by Royale and courage as mentioned in the book at the very bottom, this person came to see it. She's a woman. She came, her name was Beatrice. It comes to see the psychiatrist or psychologist feeling really depressed. She describes us as being like a frozen chicken in the supermarket. She says, she's like wrapped up in cling film as a frozen chicken. That's a self image of herself frozen. No longer in relationships, aren't able to do anything really miserable in early thirties that's how she comes along. What do I do? Well, antidepressants might help a bit, but actually something else going on. So we try to understand the story the right back to the beginning of a story inside the red box. We've, it turns out she has parents who really were quite critical of her.

Speaker 2:          23:51          They were rejected her and were quite demanding of her and she felt in response to a parish, she felt very guilty about it. But she also tried to work really hard. So she's in the red box there. She's striving and needy. Her needs aren't being met by a parent. She's quite independent. She's also quite rebellious school. So there she's at school as a young girl, she actually gets expelled. So if you look on the side that rebel gets rejected and you see that she has, she gets expelled from school, which just makes it feel worse. So she longs for closeness cause she's a, she's a, she's a attractive young woman, makes us his relationships. He often has relationships. She feels abandonment. She's in the center now. She feels abandoned. She avoids getting close to her boyfriends. She feels very lonely. She withdraws, draw people and needs are of an unmet.

Speaker 2:          24:37          She feels depressed and she feels like a frozen chicken. She doesn't dare reveal herself. So she sometimes on the other side on the left with left or right this side here, she risks becoming closer to people. He tends to idealize the person she falls in love with. She makes them out to be perfect, has an eye, a moment of complete being in love. They're perfect relationship. She then feels totally, uh, she, she feels been worthwhile, but she feels being a gardener, she run runs away again. She can't cope with the idea of being abandoned and she's back to the frozen chicken sometimes on the other side he strives very hard to please people. She pretends to be something he isn't. She hates herself. Her needs are unmet. She doesn't reveal itself. And then she feels depressed. So if like this is a joint collaborative formulation, we've made it the kind of problems that she has.

Speaker 2:          25:25          That's a formulation. Another example formulation here, this was a man called Terri who is to drink too much. He had very can inside the red box red circle. He had very rejecting, abandoning parents who are very contemporary, sort of him as a child is in a place of B. He's very lone, felt his needs for closeness, wanting was very, was contemptible. And what we find in live as you, you often tend to reproduce psychologically some of the things your parents did to you in your judgments. So he to himself was very rejecting. He were angry with himself. What he tends to do again, have, uh, he would, he would, he, he was easy. He worked, he worked in the industry. What you would find is that one, because he was quite contemptuous and angry with people, he looked around his peers. They often find that other people weren't as good as him.

Speaker 2:          26:12          So they're always, he would say to other people, other people were, he's the, he's the best of the people will be better than him and he will do reject all the people. Not surprisingly, when he did that, as we will reject him and he will be then end up being very lonely. And in fact, what he ended up doing was drinking. So he would end up being very depressed. You turn, he was on the worst person, the world and the drink. So He'd have a pattern of being contemptuous of others and contemptuous of himself. And he will reduce that. He would reproduce a pattern. When we analyze his relationships with others, he would constantly feel he was either the best or the worst. He had one way of thinking about people. He had to be the best of something. Or the worst is something. He was always winning awards at work.

Speaker 2:          26:52          And then he'd win awards. He get, he'd have, he'd, he'd boasts and other people would then reject him and they didn't end up drinking. Um, and it was a pattern. He went round and round and round and you'd find it very difficult to accept himself as he was. So that's the kind of formulation we might draw up in collaboration with a patient. And then following a formulation like that, we would then introduce ways of change. So for example, if you look at this lady here, we then talked about her sense of being rejected by others. Why, what, what, what was about her, which was, which wasn't worthy, why she was avoiding closeness and try to help her to accept herself more and gradually therefore to stop idealizing demand. She met, we should go into a completely over the top relationship where she'd want to move in the day she met them.

Speaker 2:          27:39          And they will then run away from a helper to be a little more, more careful about the relationships he got into and gradually develop relationships where she could be with people not as perfect without them being perfect, but more egalitarian relationship. And again with Terri to help him to not be so contemptuous of others because the partner got into was always to push other people to have, which meant they put him down. So that's what you might do in your, in your, in your, in your treatment. So I say the, that's quite a different approach from giving someone antidepressants. So we might well work with antidepressants as say if somebody is filling depression, depression, what the challenges are is how scientific is all of us. You may say, well what Scott got to do with science, we try to be sounds practitioners will, it's based on studies which you've used models like this to, they worked and they work.

Speaker 2:          28:28          And so a lot of evidence the CBT is effective as, as I mentioned. Uh, and so when there's a loss of, of have worked on what are the, what are the, what are the studies, what does this treatment work just well with which patients does it work? And one of the problems we have in psychiatry and psychology is that actually humans are terribly, very, everybody in this room has a different story. Doing psychological research is complicated because you all have different experiences. Whereas probably most of your kidneys or livers work kind of the same mama the mansion. But your history is your psychology is going to be so different. And we've tended to give one treatment to everybody and what the research demands is that we have more and more nuanced treatments for different people. You wouldn't want the same treatment as the person next to you cause your life story is different.

Speaker 2:          29:18          And that's why often we don't get it right cause it's very typical to get it right. Um, laws, medicine if like, I like to say that there are difficult subjects are probably simply because people are not so different. I mean there are many ways in which you can be physically ill and break the law and do have legal complications. But if you like the numbers of ways in which people relate to each other is infinitely complicated. It's difficult. And we do our best to be scientific, but we don't always get it right. Uh, therefore we do spend a lot of time thinking about it and sometimes we get over reflective and we spend our time thinking and maybe that's not always helpful. There are not so many of us because it's very expensive to train somebody to, to, to, to, to become a clinical psychologist, several hundreds of thousands.

Speaker 2:          30:03          And so the stuff you like the NHS can't afford that many and we tend to be relatively few of us. So I don't know how many of you ever actually had, just out of interest, how many few have heard of clinical psychologists as a professional high? You've heard of us? Great. But I, I, but, but, but probably not many. How many you actually no clinical psychologists personally, but for five years. Okay. And that's, that's great that you do. Um, there are not many. It's a many, many more psychiatrists. I can't trust some much more numerous than us. And of course, many, many, many, many more doctors. Um, there are many not more. Most mental health care, certainly in the UK is provided through the NHS. It's provided by nurses and doctors were very swollen number. And so how can we have these models are very interesting, but it's hard to, to actually see somebody, the chances of seeing a clinical psychologist are really quite small because there was so few of us.

Speaker 2:          30:57          Um, and one of the other things is that we know very well that the, the things that often precipitate the background to mental health problems in particular are things like poverty and, um, and, and, and, and exclusion. So we know that mental health problems are much more dominant within groups that have poor resources. Um, and if you like, if you want to improve the mental health of the nation as a whole, you might want to pay more attention to things like education and, and, and employment, unemployment and so on, uh, and inequalities. Um, and we are looking, we are looking at the individual victims, if you like, we get the people who have been damaged by some of those things. Um, and maybe a better thing would be to change society as a whole because those are the things that lead to some of the mental health problems that there are.

Speaker 2:          31:50          Um, we're, we're fixing the individuals. I appreciate you have to do both. But often there's a tension between should we treat the people, should we try and change the system, which leads to people having these problems. We can talk more about that. And so I'm, one of the other things is could we make you make much more better use of individual and information technology, the treatments, purely CBT treatments that, that um, are increasingly used. There are open to being used with technology. For example, some of the individual treatments around coming to see me to do a, a desensitization, which is a treatment for your fear of lifts or something. Could you do that online? And there are treatments which can be provided online. I had a go at this myself actually a few years ago because there's a very good program for people who have sleep problems called um, calm, sleepy.

Speaker 2:          32:42          Thank you. Cool. Sleepier which is an a CBT online treatment. Um, it's right in fact set up by a colleague of mine from Glasgow University. Now in Oxford. I don't have a major sleep problem, but I thought, well, I quite fancy you though. Sleeping a bit better. So I did the sleep program, um, which meant I had to go every week. I had to go online and about an hour and ask questions and do things differently and it was very well designed and actually I have to say really did work. It increased my ability to sleep well through the night and it was very nice. Then tribals I kind of stepped back into my bad habits after a while, which is reading in the middle of the night things and, and, and stuff and stay in bed light, which you shouldn't do if you've got sleep problems. But um, yeah, we should use information technology better to try and spread if you like psychological treatments to more people and there are ways of doing that.

Speaker 2:          33:27          Um, it's very much what, what I think next generation is going to include. Um, so I think that that starts the next, I've been sharing his here, I'm macdougal thinking with you, thinking about what can we do to spread good mental health practice. We know that depression is a major cause of dysfunction in, in the world out there. Most of us in our lifetime, we'll have either ourselves or one of our friends and family will have some mental health problem and it will cause distress to farmers and we can treat it medically, although not everybody responds to medication and in many ways having what we know is that psychological treatment and medical treatment together as one of the best, but it's hugely time consuming and it's demanding and it's expensive, so it's somewhere in which we could deliver better treatment better. One of the things that makes it difficult is that one of the things we know is important in making a psychological treatment work is relationship that you develop with the person who were helping.

Speaker 2:          34:25          So that's very important that we have a close relationship. How can you reproduce a relationship with a computer? Because we know that that bombed the person who goes up and down the lift with me. The reason she's prepared to do it is we spent several hours beforehand where I've listened to her, I've given her my tension, she trusts me, she knows that I respect her and not belittling her and I'm therefore so she trusts me in order to try doing it. How could you do that if you like on a computer? So that's one of our challenges. How to deliver more widely the mental health struggles that we have to people. I think I've probably talked enough. I was off talk about the two mature I've done so I'm be more than happy to take the conversation further in any direction and people will be interested.

Speaker 2:          35:12          Some real patterns on the trunk. It's an educational psychologist, same as a clinical psychologist, but thank you for asthma and I probably should have clarified when you turn your first degree, as I mentioned, all that, those subjects you either you can just, that's the degree. It could have been history or physics or something. Go and work for Google or something that uses psychology again or you can come at applied psychologists and they're about seven branches of psychology, which are applied. One is clinical. That was a bit I wanted to do. One is you mentioned educational. There are things like occupational, which is helping design workplaces and things. Um, educational is particularly working with children in schools, how children learn and uh, looking in particular at family difficulties so that if you are interested in, in how to be affect how dyslexia and how children behave in schools.

Speaker 2:          36:00          That's narrowed to go into. Whereas what I trained, where I trained with lot within the NHS in clinical settings, hospitals, settings, um, education psychologist. So, so I often do teaching first. So they're very familiar with the education system before they start working with teachers about how to work. Cause I worked in hospital, I worked in the NHS as a, an assistant occupational therapist for a bit. So I got used to feel like how the hospitals work, how the doctors had teams work. So you know, the workplace actually psychologists would use many of the same models like CBT. So our theory is that the same, it's the workplace. It is different. But thanks for that question. And it was um, I wanted to ask about widespread models, I guess in my wife's per processes because of course depression, anxiety, they come from things such as maybe, oh, they stem from skills like resilience and things like that.

Speaker 2:          36:55          Do you know if they're doing such, you know, what resilience course at schools nowadays? It's interesting. Yes. Because indeed w I think very important contracts. Although when you experienced depression, anxiety, you think it's you because you, you know, obviously that's how you experience it. It is indeed your, your life, which is yeah, which is in disorder or discomfort, but you're not alone and many other people, same issues and things like stress and the demands are commuting and the demands of managing workplace and the family and all that stuff as all this ads. And you're, yes, the context is important. So could we do something about that context to reduce some of that stuff? And because the real world in which we are all competing and the demands is difficult to change all of that. And as we all go and give up live in the countryside.

Speaker 2:          37:41          But assuming we don't do that kind of workplace, do something, can schools do something? One of the, one of the, the kind of fashionable, um, ideas is mindfulness. What mindfulness is a way people have heard of that. It's a way of trying to help you to get away from particular critical thoughts and the underlying model why mindfulness works. And they are teaching this in schools now and maybe in workplaces it's like relaxation. It's helping you to get off the tray, the treadmill. So if you look at the, um, I feel like, uh, this, this poor person here, she was in a treadmill because people don't want to be unhappy. We sometimes all she, she's her own worst enemy. She makes it, she wants to, she doesn't want to get better. It's not that you don't want to get better, you don't know how to change.

Speaker 2:          38:24          So change is very scary because if you always do, if you always walk in the same way, someone asked you to walk differently, how do you do that? It's really hard and we shouldn't underestimate that. So what mindfulness on these trainings try to do is to help you to get off the treadmill that you're on and think or think about it differently. So yes, there is an attempt to do that and then that is going to be a better way of solving problems. But it's such a huge thing and it's what we know is that mindfulness does work to a degree, but then again it's not good enough yet. We still don't have a panacea.

Speaker 1:          39:01          Okay.

Speaker 2:          39:05          Again, the evidence, the evidence shows that it has a, some small effect. I can't, they evidence on teaching mindfulness in schools is for some children it is helpful but not for all of them policies, difficult to engage all the kids in it. Um, so yes, the evidence is that it wasn't, again, using, trying to be scientist about it works. Some people some of the time and we're, we're on the case, but with, there isn't a solution to everything yet cause it's cause it's complex. So I know that's not a good story to tell. I'd love to say yes, but it's not, we don't know yet. Somebody here had something.

Speaker 1:          39:40          Hmm.

Speaker 2:          39:42          Thank you. I was wondering, how do clinical psychology practitioners deal with all the kind of the heavy information and the whole kind of difficult stories after work? How they decompress? I deal with it. I think it's very interesting and increasingly we're getting a bit better at that than we were. Um, I, I mentioned one of our skills as being reflective. How reflective should we be? Everybody in practice is supposed to have a supervisor, which doesn't mean someone to tell you what to do. It's somebody you can go and talk to about things. Um, and I, it is in a sense, it's like, like being a doctor, you, you kind of get used to it. And I, I, I have to say that, that, uh, of my life, I think I've become a bit inured to stories that people tell me. And sometimes I think I'm getting hard hearted because there isn't too much horrible stuff I have not heard of.

Speaker 2:          40:28          You do get used to it. The thing that I find quite difficult, so when I was first working, one of the big issues are talked about trauma. Um, one of the things we know for example is that childhood abuse and neglect and abandonment as a child is, is bad for you. We know that having an unhappy childhood is not good for you. That's the one statement I can make. Um, and when you hear stories about how children have been harmed by society or by families, that's very difficult. I used to find that really hard to hear that. Absolutely. We don't have my own children. I was hearing stories about children and abuse. That was difficult. We do, we do have the audio is you have somebody who's been through it before and I think you kind of get you focused on what to do about it rather than going on about it.

Speaker 2:          41:12          Again, we tend not to talk too much about the past. We're talking about how things are, how things are playing out now because you can't change the past. What is happening now today in your relationships, which maybe we could change. For example, one of things we found about people who've, who've been abused children is not that they abuse others because they often they don't. So a myth sometimes that they do what they do is they abuse themselves. So often they attack themselves rather than attack anybody else. So that's what you want to work with is people self harming and self if that's psychological harming rather than going into the past. So I think you hear it then you say, what do we do about it now? So you kind of a hopeful where out of it.

Speaker 3:          41:54          It's very sounds.

Speaker 4:          41:57          So, um, what do you think the biggest differences between approaches to clinical psychology? Um, in the US and the UK are?

Speaker 2:          42:08          That's interesting because I'm my colleagues, you know who work in the UK and I did spend a couple of months in, in, in uh, in University of Florida and looking at the system, the health system there, I'm not that experienced, but you know what, I understand one of the big differences it because we're NHS based clinical psychology, pine lodge, we, we tend to have shorter treatments because of the cost of treatment and we, so we were very much evidence based, what is it, the works in the shortest time. So there's more pressure to do things more quickly. Tends to be there for CBT is the model of choice. Whereas in the U s is more psychodynamic therapist, which is more Freud in based or relationship based which take a bit longer. The evidence is there equally helpful but they take longer so that's a difference. We notice that's the most obvious difference. Somebody, lots of pants. Good. I like this.

Speaker 4:          43:06          What do you expect in years to come? There'll be lots of things in your redbox associated with social media and social media pressures, particularly on adolescents.

Speaker 2:          43:17          Yeah, that's very interesting cause I think what you are, one is humans are enormous influence by people around them and and your close relationships, your parents, your friends are very important to you. Especially for adolescents. They, there's a huge, when the press is separation from parents, we are assumes we need attachments to others. Separation process from your parents means you start to attach to clean the teen years to your peer group. If your peer group is a perfect peer group on social media who all look fantastic, good parties all the time and have a great time, but your not that teaches you, you're not a very worthwhile person. So I think yes, I do see that as a problem and particularly for adolescents, we know that mental health of young people today is getting worse and, and I suspect, but I don't know well enough what the evidences of a social psychologist to come. We work, you know, the evidence is on social media stories

Speaker 3:          44:24          really bad. Um, and it's a mixture of these social comparisons that normally if you like, that's within a group of 25, uh, suddenly you've got 700,000 to make your comparisons with and guess what, you come out badly. Um, and the other thing is that he will behave worse to each other when they are not face to face. It's an image. Um, uh, people do much nastier things to each other over social media than they would face to face. So those two facts naked, a very dangerous place to be, even though it's got lots of positives.

Speaker 2:          45:09          I think the programs, there's teaching people how to use social media because it, I'm certainly, when I'm, I don't use Facebook. Whenever I see anything, I think, Oh God, these people having much more fun than I'm having. But of course it's all myth and story. I know that. But it's hard when you're, when you're young. How do you know that? For sure. So yes, I think that's one of the boxes you would put in there, which is the world around you is much more likely to be a less comfortable place to be when you're just a little you for the oil, a little problems. So I think that's, that's certainly true. And I think that helping people to ways of dealing with that and understanding the, of course you put, you spend hours making the perfect selfie. Most of us don't look like that most of the time.

Speaker 2:          45:48          So yes. I'm sure that's true. Eh, you've mentioned the relationship between the therapist and therapy. Uh, how do you deal with, uh, people that kind of get addicted to your, to the relationship, relying more on their therapy then solving their problems on their own? Yes, it's ranging issue because one of the things you're doing when you, a patient comes and tell with that client, which have a word you're using, we use both comes to see you and tells you they feel like their difficulties. Um, my professional job is to listen to the person and give them my full attention and understand them. So I'm giving them a lot of sort of cues that I'm there for them. We have to very careful that's not misunderstood and the relationship because normally when you sit on your own with somebody in the room and they're paying really good attention for an hour or something, um, that, that uh, that's very nice, experienced.

Speaker 2:          46:41          We listened to being valued, especially if the person, I was very few other places where they are experienced as valued, which is why it's very important that we have a lot of signals and signs around, which is this is, uh, this is a professional relationship, is not a personal relationship. And there's always that difficulty at some point where the person may start to, to wish they had a personal relationship with. I've certainly had people want to ask me out to dinner and people have got, you know, t wanted more personal relationship and that's understandable because you've being terribly nice to them and you're listening to them and being there for them. But again, it's very important that your vote also very clear. It's why we often use our professional titles and we only see people in consulting rooms. This is not a social space, this is a workspace.

Speaker 2:          47:29          And all the time you're helping them to understand that this is a, this is a way of talking about your problems. This isn't solving your problems. Problems are up there. We're going to help you get back out there. Again, this is limited and we also often talk about time limits. So we'll say, I'm gonna see you for six sessions. And we may, in some models we actually say, well, you know, we count down the session so they know it's going to come to an end. But it's a very good, and going back to the, to the question about the USA, where you work in a more psychodynamic model forward your model, that model where you have a longer term relationship that can be more problematic and is part of our training tart to handle that. And it's understandable why people can get dependent cause you know, that happens. And the other thing is some, some of some many training also require you to have experience of therapy. So you as a therapist can go, part of your training is to be a patient and you then discover how easy it is to idealize the person or to stop rehearsing what you tell them and tell them that partly true story and not holds true story because you're worried about that one. Yeah. So it sounded good. That was a good way of handling it.

Speaker 4:          48:39          The clinical body Nice. Have to make really difficult decisions about how they allocate resources. Uh, you know, we can't afford this particular medicine for this group of people given there are so few of you, I was just interested to know how, how is it triaged in terms of who's going to get treatment?

Speaker 2:          48:56          Yes. There's national [inaudible] National Institute of Clinical Excellence, um, which will provide a, because that's the right acronym isn't it? No, mostly yeah, they, they, they provide guidance on what treatments they do recommend psychological treatments, um, for a number of different, uh, uh, call, uh, conditions, um, based on evidence. And again, quite rightly better than evidence. If I have treatment, I want to know that is it is the right treatment for my particular condition. They, they do recommend then for example, one of these, we known psychosis. I mentioned psychosis. When people have major mental health problems, hallucinations and delusions that the evidence shows that if you provide treatment for the individuals early as possible, the first episode of psychosis, which normally happens, uh, in the, in the late teens, early twenties, slight different from men and women. It's a devastate can be a devastating life course if you, if it fully develops, if you can get it really early and get early treatment in, you can prevent the condition from developing.

Speaker 2:          49:59          You can help person psychologically, medically if a team gets in then early. So if, if that's a really good news story is that we don't have longterm patients. If you can get them quick, you can divert the psychosis, you can prevent it. Um, and it's, it's really late, late teens ish often connected with, well, Sonos connect with cannabis use, not always, and there are no sources of evidence that the show clear evidence that one of the components is family tree where you work with the family to understand how to deal the young person is they often still living at home. Uh, and that is what the Nice, what the evidence shows we should do. But there aren't enough people, so a lot of people don't get the right treatment. So sadly there are people out there not getting what we're not nice as they should get because the just aren't enough people.

Speaker 2:          50:47          How's the cost of yeah, sure. Yes, absolutely. Absolutely, absolutely. All those things are true, but it's expensive. Nice question. How we want to spend our money. I mean, one of the problems I have to say this, the last few successive governments have tried and you'll hear on the news saying, this notion of this concept is called parity of esteem. That we esteem our mental health as much as our physical health. But it is not the case. If you have, if you, if you Sally diagnosed with some kidney disease or cancer or something, um, you will get seen pretty quickly and be seen by the best experts in your area. Hopefully if you have a mental health problem like psychosis, you don't know where they're going to get treatment because we don't invest as much in mental, physical health. Um, that's always been the way because we stigmatize mental health.

Speaker 2:          51:39          We think there's something wrong with you. You're to blame somehow you brought on yourself. If you have mental health problem and it's, it goes quite deep rooted that we use the word, I use it in casual speech. Oh, it's psychological. I'll say if I've got a stomachache, oh, it's psychological. In other words, it's not real because it doesn't mean how to tool because what is psychological is absolutely real. And we are, we are, we are physical, mental being, we're all together. We all, you know, you can't have a mental health prom without a physical health problem and vice versa. But over history we've tended to put one in box more than the other. One's good and one's bad. So mental health hasn't had the investments in this series. Treatments. I think that's changing. I say that is changing. There is more important now placed on that.

Speaker 2:          52:23          And certainly going back to the question of the UK, us, I if he's still here, gentleness. Oh yes. W is that we've been much more nervous to talk about mental health in the UK. I think it's changing now, especially with, with CBT coming more, having people more access to it to say you're having therapies now reasonable. And people talk about that. It used to be anathema. For example, in our training when we train people, I remember my father saying to me when I was thinking about trainer, oh that's very interesting. But, um, you know, it's, it's not, not, uh, if you want to go into this not working with very nice people and you'll be so important that you yourself don't have any mental health problems. Now we see it very definitely from that we see we as trainers and as students and as practitioners may well have mental health firms ourselves. Everybody has mental health problems. We're not different. We're trying to, in some ways I might break my leg or have diabetes. It doesn't make me a bad doctor. Likewise, I might be suffering from mental health problems. Well, it's okay to do that is not, I'm a bad person so we're trying very much to change the attitudes which are difficult, but you absolutely right about that. We should spend more. But that's a political discussion which we can have elsewhere.

Speaker 2:          53:40          Thank you. Um, you mentioned that CBT and online therapies quite new. Um, is there any evidence of the moment whether it's more effective than that face to face therapy wasn't engineered? It is. It seems to be with certain, with certain groups is as effective, which is quite challenging to all of us who've been doing it for years. Um, but what was interesting is, um, yes, it so does that was effective and that's a good thing to do, but it has to be set out right and you have to get the relationship factors in there. Right. I mentioned I did the sleep here program, which was, uh, which was interesting to do. But what I found myself doing was I would, I assume that I was talking to this guy, you know, I would, I would think, well, what's he, what's he thinking about me? Now?

Speaker 2:          54:19          Of course it wasn't, he wasn't thinking it's a program, but what people do is they liked it to be a person there. So I think when we design these things, well, they can be helpful. One of the, one of the, one of the very, very important things to do is change how people think about it. And one of the good things about rolling out programs is it helps people to think, to normalize it more. Just quickly. One point I should make about the cognitive model I talked about where you can think one of the, one of the most damaging things people can think about is how abnormal their thinking is. And if you can normalize it helped people to know what, what when one of the things we know about post traumatic stress disorder, um, when you've had a traumatic episode, when something happens, if a bomb dropped on us, we, it's gasoline traumatic.

Speaker 2:          55:05          We will all have, but see when we've, hopefully we survive it. We will have flashbacks, we will have bad experiences. If you can understand that that's normal. Normal people always have bad experiences after trauma and granted they fade over the days, the months, your traumatic experiences that will fade, then you will get better. If you think you are odd and unusual and it's of evidence shows that you are uniquely week, uh, mentally ill because you've had this trauma is traumatic reaction, then you won't get better so quickly. One of the great things about rolling up large scale is perhaps people will understand that their reactions are actually normal. So k to feel trauma. It's okay to feel bad and that's rolling out. Larger scale programs will help people to see the mental health problems are not unique. You're not the only one to feel depressed, sad, angry, have relationship problems. It's normal, it's human. And that's, I think, what large scale programs, which hopefully organizations such as yourselves will be helpful to us in developing.
