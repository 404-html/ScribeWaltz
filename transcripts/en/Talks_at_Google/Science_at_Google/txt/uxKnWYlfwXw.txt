Speaker 1:          00:06          Jim costa traveled to us from western North Carolina and despite the impacts of Hurricane Irma and many delays, he made it in late last night. So we're glad to have him here. James t Costa is a professor of biology at Western Carolina University and Executive Director of the highlands biological station and a trustee of the Charles Darwin Trust. He lives in the Blue Ridge mountains of North Carolina. In his book, Darwin's backyard, how small experiments led to a big theory. He goes beyond the portrait of Charles Darwin as a brilliant thinker to concentrate on him as a nimble experimenter delving into some of evolutions. Greatest mysteries. Please join me in welcoming professor Costa.

Speaker 2:          00:50          Thank you all for being here. It's really a special pleasure. Um, I have, you know, a deep connection with Cambridge, but I've never had the pleasure of visiting your office is here, so this has been great seeing the place with you. So thanks. Thanks so much. And a, I do appreciate your being here and, um, you know, allowing me to share one of my passions. You know, my background is entomology, but some years ago it became pretty interested in the history of evolutionary thinking. And a lot of my work in recent years has been on Darwin. Alfred Russell Wallace has fellow naturalist of the 19th century. And, um, I became intrigued by, you know, what we, what, what, what lessons Darwin might still hold for us today. You know, kind of understanding how he came to his yeah. His ideas. And, um, some years ago I worked on an annotated version of on the origin of species and, and working on that project, I, I came to realize that, you know, a whole lot of the arguments and the origin are, are based on these often really quirky experiments, like literally backyard experiments.

Speaker 2:          01:51          And I became fascinated by that side of Darwin, especially because the Darwin that I saw, you know, as you get to know this individual, the flesh and blood person a really seemed at odds with the, you know, Darwin, the icon Darwin that, um, you know, the, this is the kind of Darwin that most people think of you, do you think you think of these portraits. And he said, this is the melancholy Darwin, this is the sad Darwin, maybe the tormented Darwin. Um, the, you know, uh, I believe that what we're seeing here, this kind of cardboard cutout, you know, icon that seems rather rather melancholy, um, is really more, you know, w w w more insightful may be a Victorian portraiture conventions or limitations of the photographic technology of the day where you're not going to hold a smile for many long minutes. Um, really, I, I came to appreciate this impish side of Darwin.

Speaker 2:          02:43          I saw this Darwin as, um, as a dad, as a husband, as a friend, as a jokester, a practical joker, you know, so about sort of twinkle in his eye. And I want to, you know, um, share with you, um, this idea of what Darwin did literally in his backyard. Um, and how, you know, the, the, how those activities kind of give us a, uh, what I think is a, is a much more, um, accurate portrait of the human being. You know, Darwin, the person, and as you'll see, my secondary interest in this project wasn't just a humanized Darwin, but also as an educator, as a scientist myself. Um, I became interested in the ways in which Darwin, uh, and his method could be harnessed pedagogically. We can use that, um, at really any level from kindergarteners up to college students and really use the way he approached understanding the natural world.

Speaker 2:          03:36          Um, as a, as an interesting novel way to approach science education. I'm teaching about ecology, evolution, scientific inquiry, those sorts of things. So, so this is a portrait, really have a rather different kinds of Darwin than I think most of you would be familiar with. In all likelihood. This is one, a quote from Darwin. Um, in his self deprecating way. He would talk about his fullest experiments. He loves fools experiments. He's always making them and that kind of gives them insight into what he's up to, the backstory to Darwin's books as experiment after experiment. Some of them very quirky, um, on the fly, literally done at home because famously he became something of a home body and did not travel much after his, around the world voyage on HMS Beagle. And I want to give you sort of have some insight into Darwin again, uh, as a family man.

Speaker 2:          04:26          Uh, and the way that his family, his kids played a role in many of these quirky experiments. Some Darwin, um, had 10 children, seven of whom survived to adulthood and throughout their, um, their upbringing, they're constantly involved in dad's activities and a as well as his wife, Emma, as well as nieces and nephews. Um, you know, the extended family. And so, you know, there are some interesting, um, you know, little snippets of, you know, getting some sense of how the kids were involved at different times. So one anecdote for example that's pretty well substantiated, you know, uh, comes from one of the kids who, you know, for about an eight year period, Darwin, um, famously, you know, immersed himself in the study of Barnacles of all things. And so for at least one of the kids their whole life as they were growing up, they knew nothing.

Speaker 2:          05:20          My Dad working on barnacles and the story goes that visiting some friends, um, the, you know, they kind of looked, looked around and wondering, well, where does your dad do? Is Barnacles, you know, um, like every, every kid's dad must work on Barnacles, you know, is the idea. And, um, you know, some of their studies, some of their investigations were just, you know, fun, but always an interesting scientific point behind them. So one episode involved, I'm chasing around Bumblebees, which we now understand male bees, trap lining pheromonal the leading trails kind of through an area. They had no idea. Pheromones had not been discovered yet at this time. And they're running around and marketing bs with flour to make them more visible. And, um, it was just really quite a family adventure to try to understand what are these bees doing? It was the mystery of the buzzing places.

Speaker 2:          06:06          One of the kids later reminisced that at that time, you know, that his father was like a boy amongst other boys. Um, and, and I think that that says a lot. This is, and I think all of you can perhaps appreciate this. There's a certain childish enthusiasm, a sense of wonder and enthusiasm about something interesting in the natural world. And then trying to under understand it. Here's just one other little example of involving the kids. Um, this, this is from a, you can imagine maybe little red periodical called the entomologists to weekly Intelligencer. You know, you can imagine, you know, that every house, all it must be reading this magazine. So, you know, here you've got a little note about the f the capture of some rare beetles. And this is obviously dad writing the note, but signing it, three of the kids, right? Frances Lennard and Horace Darwin, ages 11, nine and eight.

Speaker 2:          07:02          And so that you can sort of envision, that's the proud dad. He loved Beatles himself on these quite a beetle collector. And just very proud, I think that his kids were, you know, really into Beatles too and collecting them. And, um, so he fires off this little note, you know, to the weekly and entomologists weekly intelligence are pretty interesting. So those are little, little snippets, you know, Darwin, uh, at his home, um, in, in Kent Down House had a thinking path. This is his thinking path. And um, he would famously, you know, put a few stones at one, at one end of the thinking path and kick them away as he made his rounds and the kids would go and replace them. Really wanting to keep them going longer because there was always something interesting to be found. Um, so I think that the thinking path is a good place to start, you know, in talking about Darwin's experiments and they are fun.

Speaker 2:          07:53          A lot of his experiments are really just genuinely fun, you know, rather quirky, rather odd always. There's an interesting scientific question behind them as well. We'll, we'll discuss. Um, they are accessible, you know, and this is interesting too. I mean, Darwin working in the Victorian period, literally at his home, he's, he's not working with sophisticated scientific instrumentation maybe beyond a microscope on really, his experiments are done on the fly. He's just pulling together, you know, whatever materials are at hand at the house, and then devising a way to test some scientific question that actually makes us experiments eminently accessible today, right? We don't need sophisticated scientific instruments, for example, precision instruments in order to actually engage in meaningful scientific inquiry necessarily. And there's interesting implications for teaching scientific inquiry, I think. Um, and of course adaptable. I think that any of these experiments and the questions behind them are adapted to virtually any age group.

Speaker 2:          08:56          They, some of them are adaptable to kindergarten age. Some of them, you know, there were layers of sophistication where you can get into more sophisticated considerations like replication or concepts like, um, statistical significance at the college level perhaps or high school level. Um, so scalable and adaptable, which I think also makes them eminently interesting. Um, from a, from an educational point of view today. Right. So, so what was the experiment sizing, you know, really all about? Well, first and foremost about curiosity, right? It all starts with curiosity about the natural world, natural phenomena, pattern, process. Um, but ultimately as I'll show you, Darwin became very keen on really, um, not just demonstrating the voracity of his ideas about evolutionary change and the mechanism of natural selection, but ultimately extending that paradigm. And so many of his research programs are really intended to flesh out, um, reconfirm and extend his evolutionary insights as we'll see.

Speaker 2:          09:58          So editors is what he's looking for. Um, if any of you have read on the origin of species, you may, you may recall that near the end of the book, Darwin refers to the book as one long argument and it hangs together in an interesting way, many different subjects. And I became fascinated by the fact that, you know, there's another book behind the book behind the one long argument and that book is this one, right? His experiment book is experiment notebook. This is the book that he committed, um, many, many observations, experimental results, musings and so on. And I'll give me just, you know, there's so much that could be discussed. I'm just going to give you one example of an Eh, uh, a research area that had, that really shows off the different facets of Darwin's, um, method and, and his interests. So, so, and that, that is that, that example will be dispersal, take dispersal.

Speaker 2:          10:53          That is the question of geographical distribution. How do species become distributed on the earth as we see them? And he undertook, you know, just a diversity of weird and wonderful experiments to gather data to answer questions that often we would just say, well, of course, or that must be obvious, but if there were no data, nobody really knew. So he, you have to start somewhere. So he, so for example, this is just a list of some of the quirky experiments that he undertook, you know, bomb seeds and salt water seed, buoyancy, hitchhiker experiments with duck's feet, you know, Dunkin ducks and, and you know, Aquaria with duckweed and, and so on. So, so for example, um, Galapagos Islands, right? Remote Oceanic Islands loom large, uh, in, in, in talking about Darwin and the history of evolution. Um, so, but, but it begs a question, any remote island system begs the question, you know, what, how new species get there.

Speaker 2:          11:51          Exactly. It's easy enough to see that might be blown, you know, far off course or you know, other winged animals. Um, but really there's a lot of other organisms besides things that can fly. How do they get there? Well, you know, maybe they raft or they float or they can be carried in some way, but how exactly. Darwin was convinced that an whole lot of these organisms, seeds and such actually floated some of them just in salt water, some of them rafting. Um, but his, his colleagues, his friends and colleagues who are generally supportive of him, um, really were dubious of this. They didn't think that seeds could possibly survive exposure to salt water, you know, so what to do, but you know, tests to demonstrate this. And Darwin never did anything by halves. So he embarked upon a two year investigation, floating seeds and salt water.

Speaker 2:          12:38          And not just an end of, you know, two or three, but really just taking over the house, you know, just said, you know, you know, jar after jar of saltwater with seeds of, you know, Marian species, you know, he fills up the cellar, you know, he fills up his study. Um, the, the object was to see, we'll, how long can see survive exposure to salt water. Um, so you would take samples periodically. Can they survive a week? Can they survive two weeks, a month, two months, five months. And you know, the kids were very excited because his good friend Joseph Hooker, the botanist was very dubious of this. He didn't think that anything would come of it. Um, so the kids got in on, you know, they saw it as a contest and in one letter to hooker, he reported that the children were very eager and asked Tim often whether he would beat Dr Hooker and show him yet, yes, they can survive in saltwater, you know, yes, that can't happen.

Speaker 2:          13:27          Then there's the inconvenience of hooker kind of pointing out that, well, they might be able to survive in saltwater, but oftentimes they sink. And so it's a moot point whether they can survive in saltwater, they're never gonna make it to an island if they're sinking. And I'm in another letter, you know, he writes to hooker, his, you know, you see his exasperations, you know, the gift, the con founded seeds will sink. I've been taking all this trouble, insulting the ungrateful rascals for nothing, right? The letters, you know, his, his diary, the letters, um, his notebooks, they really are this phenomenal window into Darwin, the person and the working method. And so here you see, you know, um, you know, you can try on and then set backs. You know, what does he do in the face of sinking seeds? Well, you know, let's try dry seeds.

Speaker 2:          14:13          Let's try flow. I'm drying vegetation, let's try fruits. And so these are just pages from the experiment book where species after species, after species, he's testing them and trying to see, you know, how long will they float? A, how long will seed survive. Ultimately this all makes it into, on the origin of species. He is able to show that they could survive some many of these species months at a time. Ocean currents can carry them thousands of miles. He's, you know, triumphantly saying this is a viable means for getting species to remote oceanic islands. As unlikely as it may be, it clearly must happen, right? Um, in the book, you know, each chapter ends with a kind of do it yourself section where you can sort of experiment ties all La Darwin. You can, for example, replicates some of his seed salting experiments. And, um, do you know, is it's great fun.

Speaker 2:          15:03          I've done this with science educators. I've done it with, with my kids and other kids. Um, I've done it with my students and, uh, you know, again, it's not just fun, but actually there is this interesting point about better understanding, you know, geographical distribution, dispersal of species on the planet, and you think about it, lakes and ponds are like islands on the land. How do aquatic organisms get around from lake to lake pond to pond? Well, logically you might think, well they're, maybe they're carry, cause clearly little aquatic snails are not leaving a pond to go miles and miles to another pond. Right? Probably they're carried. Well, once again, it's our been thought of that, but there were no data, there was just no information one way or another. So, so, so what does he do? Well, well, he devises a test that uses actual duck's feet, right?

Speaker 2:          15:49          Presumably they're eating these ducts, he's saving the legs and then dangling the legs in Aquaria full of snails to see if the snails will hop aboard the feet. He's imagining that sleeping ducks in lakes, uh, as the feet are dangling down, snails will become hitchhikers in the morning. They're duck wakes up off. It flies maybe hundreds of miles carrying the snail with it, you know. So, um, I devise, of course we, you know, in my version we're not going to use real duck feet. Um, but we have, there's a way to make a model duck foot out of a dowel in a, in a bobber or some kind of a float and you know, a fabric duck foot. And actually this is one of my kids here. We're actually sort of casting for hitchhikers, you know, in, in ponds and it's amazing actually what you will catch kind of casting duck's feet in ponds, all odd Darwin.

Speaker 2:          16:36          So it's a, it's really a great way to get young people engaged with these scientific questions. Now this is a general subject that also says something about Darwin, the crowdsource or I think he's maybe the original crowd sourcer, you know, these are just four letters to the editor, open letters that he published in 1855 as one example, where again, he's wondering about seeds surviving and salt water. He's wondering, has anyone ever looked at this? Are there any data? Is there any information? So publishing open letters, will any of your readers a be so kind as to inform me whether it's such experiments? I've already been tried, he's exhorting readers of this magazine, the Gardener's chronicle, try this experiment, send me your results. Um, ultimately several people took him up on this and they're cited in the origin of species actually. So it's pretty, pretty interesting.

Speaker 2:          17:25          Um, so he's, he's crowdsourcing here and he does this to good effect with quite a few other other subjects as well. He's also open to the two rather unorthodox approaches to the question. And here's yet another facet. Here's one of the kids, um, little Francis or he as he was called when he was eight years old, came up with an experiment and it seems a little crazy. So, but here's Darwin reporting this to his buddy Joseph Hooker. He says, look, I must tell you another of my profound experiments. You know, he's sort of very tongue in cheek about how profound it is. He says, Frankie says to me, why shouldn't a bird imagine a Burg with seeds in its crop killed by hail or lightening or something over the open ocean and then the carcasses floating and eventually is kind of washed up on a distant shore and has fertilizer built in, right with the rotting carcass.

Speaker 2:          18:14          And wouldn't that be a dispersal mechanism? So where does Darwin say no sooner said than done? He takes a poor pigeon, right? Um, we've got seeds in the crop and this poor pigeon is killed and is floating in a salt water tank for 30 days. And then Darwin is able to report once the plants it, ah, the seeds, they, they germinated splendidly right data, right. Um, very interesting. Well, a whole different area of interest to him had to do with field botany. And um, here's this was from another letter. You know, if you ever catch quite a beginner, I want to give them a taste for botany. Haven't make a perfect list of some little field or wood. And he speaks from experience here. He really was passionate about botany and he had listed the help of Catherine Thorley, who is the governess of the kids, call him, had a talent for botany and very keen on helping with experiments.

Speaker 2:          19:06          So they would botanize and try to characterize the diversity in sent areas, really a forerunner runner of the modern quadrant approach to doing botanical surveys. Um, here you see glimpses in the letter of his sense of humor. Um, like for example, when he identified his first grass, which botanically can be, they can be very difficult to identify and he says, Hurrah, Hurrah. You know, I never expected to make out of grass in my life, you know. Well, what's interesting about these experiments with Miss Thorley is that they are the forerunners of experiments that are now considered to be foundational in modern ecology and evolution. So modern ecological concepts that you'll find in any introductory bio textbook, any introductory ecology course. And the students learn about niche partitioning, competitive exclusion, um, they learned about, um, on demographic analysis and Population and population pressure. Though those insights came from these simple experiments.

Speaker 2:          20:06          And as you can see in the upper right here, literally in Darwin's backyard, this is down house and he's has a three by four plot, uh, where he is conducting experiments. Um, the so called lawn plot where he mo's all around, but he leaves the unknown plot just to watch the dynamics of the different species that come and go. He sort of chronicling that and he wants to document the, he has a hypothesis about the relationship of the different species that end up coexisting. The phyletic diversity packed into a very small geographical area or the weed garden where he clears the plot completely and marks every seedling as it comes up. Essentially it is, it is a modern demographic study he's looking at, um, at the mortality rate of these plants. And he documents the on the extreme what he calls of course the struggle for existence, the mortality rate, um, that ends up reinforcing his arguments about how natural selection works.

Speaker 2:          21:04          So I find it fascinating that those cornerstone ecological principles today have their origin in these simple backyard experiments. And again, you know, anybody can duplicate these experiments that I think it's actually great fun, um, to take Darwin's original data and then compare that with with one's own data. I'm doing these, these different law and plots or, or we'd gardens. Well, if the origin is one long argument, consider that the origin was far from Darwin's last book, right? There's another dozen or so books, uh, after on the origin of species. About half a dozen of them on botanical subjects. Every one of these books has interesting experiments. Some of them pioneering where Darwin made fundamental discoveries, um, in, um, in different aspects of ecology, evolution, botany, behavior. These are, this is just a sampler of, of topics, you know, orchids, Barnacles, inheritance, you know, the construction of B cells, expression of emotions, pollination mechanisms.

Speaker 2:          22:03          He's often juggling multiple experimental areas at the same time, which is interesting in its own right. Planting experimental gardens in his yard. Eventually building a greenhouse. This is Darwin's greenhouse where he would keep climbing plants, orchids, carnivorous plants. And so on. His first book after the origin was on orchids in fact, and he was fascinated by the different contrivances, the highly derived adaptations of orchids and their pollination relationship with insects, often one, one to one relationship and fascinated by the different ways that orchids package their pollen and then deliver the pollen through adhering them to insects. And he discovered that some, like the one in color here, cat Hasidim, some of them don't simply stick their pollen to an insect that can forcibly fire their pollen at, at insects. Um, one of his, his neighbor and protege, John Lubbock, um, in a, in a memoir that he published in 1874 commented on how Mr Darwin has been so good as to irritate one of these flowers in my presence.

Speaker 2:          23:06          The plenty IOM was thrown nearly three feet when it struck and adhere to the pain of a window, Darwin and his impish way. It would sometimes take on friends and family, sort of who are unaware of showing them around his greenhouse. And then he would surreptitiously trigger a cat, a see them and get it to fire pollen at the, at, at his visitors. Um, there are several accounts of that. He would also go out to a, uh, a favorite family picnic spot near the house. He called it the family called it Orkis Bank. Uh, for it's, it's nice to native orchids and, uh, at sites like this, he would study, uh, how insects, um, transfer pollen like this beautiful Burnett and off, you'll notice that the fun, it's coiled proboscis. How's those yellow, uh, structures? Those are the millennia. Those are the pollen packets of the orchid.

Speaker 2:          23:52          Um, and then the, uh, the drawing here is from Darwin's orchid book. He's looking at these malls, unfurling that proboscis and really interested in demonstrating exactly how insects, um, lock and key, the sort of relationships are our fitting, uh, with, with their orchids. Right. And that's just one little bit of his adventures in pollination. Um, Darwin spent inordinate amounts of time studying the ways insects interacted with flowers. The, there were accounts of the family visiting the Zoological Gardens in London while the kids and everyone else are looking at the animals. Darwin is crawling in the flower beds and he's making observations like you see up here, upper right, this is taken from the experiment book. He's, he's drawing, um, the, you know, the ways in which bees will approach certain flowers. He's interested in also trip action mechanisms. Like you find that Inbar berries or Mahonia where they're very touch sensitive, uh, an insect just approaches and touches the flower slightly.

Speaker 2:          24:48          And then the, you know, the, the statements will, will suddenly be triggered and they will shower the insect with pollen, um, or, or beans, the common bean, which has, it's a statement and pistols wrapped up. He calls it like a French horn. When these land on those down hanging pedals outed, comes in and dabs pollen on the back of the B. So he documented meticulously numerable cases of, of pollination. And he made an interesting discovery. Um, it wasn't completely new. Botanists knew about this but didn't know what it meant. And this is the phenomenon known as Hetero styley and it's a, it's a case of two or more flower morphs. Uh, he first discovered it in primroses, uh, so-called female morph and a male morph. So the one on the, on the, on the left here, the female morph has a very long pistol and very short statements.

Speaker 2:          25:39          The male morph has the reverse. It has very long stamens as you see here. And a very, very short pistol. Well, he was fascinated by this and Darwin and his characteristic way thinks big and he's interested in the evolution of sexes, right? Big Picture. And he thinks maybe this is an example of evolution in action that may be the female morph is eventually becoming a female only flower evolutionarily. And the male morphous becoming a male only flower, which you do find in some groups. So maybe this is an example of evolution in action. So he has this, this hypothesis and what do you do? You know, the first thing to do is, you know, document, document the frequency. He Marshall's the troops, the troops are the kids. So he gets the kids, you know Horace, who's nine, Lenny Frankie Bessie out they go. And this is, these are, this is a page from the experiment book collecting primroses and he says, my May 13th, my children gathered great bunch of cows, lips 79 stocks where male flowers, 52 were female flowers.

Speaker 2:          26:41          And then he would do cross after cross after cross after cross. These are all from the experiment book documenting how he would, um, hand transfer pollen. And ultimately when, when the seeds form then count up the seeds. And his hypothesis hypothesis is that the female morph, um, that would perhaps have more seeds, significantly more seeds produced than the male morph. Well, interesting hypothesis, but he butted right up against his friend. Huxley is Great Tragedy Of Science, right? The slaying of a beautiful hypothesis by an ugly fact. And the ugly fact in this case was that he found exactly the opposite of what his working hypothesis suggested. Right. And indeed that was the male morph that ended up producing more seeds than the female morph. Um, so, you know, nonetheless informative in its own way. Ultimately he got it right. He had published a whole separate book on this subject we're in, which he argued that these different morphs, their function evolutionarily is to enforce out crossing cross fertilization.

Speaker 2:          27:47          And it's now been documented in a great multitude of, of plant groups, um, in, in my book, um, in that, in that spirit of, of Darwin's experimental rising, of course, I have examples of some of the plans that he explored and instructions on how, you know, they're different pollination mechanisms can be explored by, um, you know, experimental enthusiasts, schoolkids et Cetera. A couple more examples for you. Carnivorous plants. So again, thinking big picture, Darwin's interested in plant like animals and animal like plants. And of course there were two groups of plants that are, you know, just eminently animal like, and one is the carnivorous plants and he's smitten first by Sun dews and his wife Emma comments, uh, in a letter to a two to a friend. He hopes in the end to prove it to be an animal and she's only half kidding. He really does think that, you know, in such groups who can, you can see that plant animal, um, intersection that they have common ancestry, that there are physiological and other mechanisms that they have in common.

Speaker 2:          28:52          So what does he do? The very first thing he does is begin to explore their dietary preferences. Um, so he's on holiday in Bournemouth and first he tries his hair, then he tries his toenails, you know, um, and of course not very profound results. Right. You know, clearly though they don't, they sort of spit out the hair and they spit out the toenails. Um, but, but he embarks upon a year's long investigation of the dietary preferences of Sun dews and fly traps and eventually really does get it right. He understands. He can see the fore runner of digestive enzymes that were later to be discovered in animals on pepsin and and such. Um, and so I give some examples of how you can replicate some of Darwin's experiments trying, um, different delights that they really enjoy and some that they don't like very much and exactly the way Darwin founded fly traps as well.

Speaker 2:          29:43          Darwin found that, um, these little tricombs, there's a certain frequency and sequence for touching these little tricombs on the inner surface of a fly trap necessary to trip the, the trap. And um, you know, that's all easily replicated using a probe or a hair climbing plants. That's the other group that seems a group of plants that seems eminently animal like, and Darwin made an independent discovery of the principle of circum nutation, the constant circular probing movement of climbing plants. It turns out that almost all plants, they're growing shoots move in that way, but it's highly elaborated and adaptive and climbing plants. And tendrils and growing shoots. So what did he do? Well, he commandeered the family terrarium, right? So, so every, every fine home had a miss mailings, patent, indoor pancakes of course. Um, and in their parlor they had one of these, but Darwin Room removed all the ornamental plants, took it over, put climbing plants in there.

Speaker 2:          30:41          And you see in the lower left here how he used the pop of the glass with tracing paper with a climbing plant inside a little markers and reference points so he can follow the movement of the very end of the growing tip. And in that way documented that circular movement. And he coined the term circle mutation, which is still used today. Very, very interesting. And of course hops as a great example of a, of a plant that circle new tastes in a, in a wonderful way, fairly frequent movement in that, uh, or fast movement. And so I give instructions on how one can create a circle of new tolmatter. I'm either using a clock, like disc or, or compass coordinates and sort of document. The way the shoot is, is moving. We'll finally, um, Darwin really back way back in the 1830s, was fascinated by earthworms.

Speaker 2:          31:32          And this is also the subject of his very last book. So this kind of bookends Darwin's experimental life. He's fascinated by earthworms as a geological force. And then also later on he became really interested in earthworms intelligence and their personality traits and their preferences, which seems a little, a little funny, but he's very serious about that. Uh, in one letter to a niece, he sorta confides how he's becoming deeply attached to worms is fascinated by them all through the 1870s. He's working on them as a geological force. He believes that earthworms slowly, surely inexorably rework the landscape, right? They're undermining, they're taking soil up in the form of their castings, they're turning over soil and that way objects slowly sink. And he even collected data from sites like Stonehenge. You went out to stone henge great fallen blocks of stone and was measuring how deeply it had sunk.

Speaker 2:          32:28          He was looking at Roman ruins, how deeply different artifacts have sunk, and then experimentally trying this by putting blocks of stone out in fields and then monitoring years. How's they slowly subside. In fact, his son, Horace, who later founded the Cambridge Scientific Instrument Company, I'm really showed his experimental bent pretty early. So this is his youngest son and Horace designed what is known as the worms stone. And this is still in evidence that down house today, the warm stone is a millstone and Horace designed a precision micrometer and you see it here, he actually published this, the, the plans for this in nature in 1,901. Um, and the idea was that with a precision micrometer, the subsidence of the of the millstone can be very carefully measured, right? So the action of the worms could be quantified in that way. Um, so in that way he quantified the rate of subsidence, but the other half of that equation is the soil brought to the surface.

Speaker 2:          33:27          So with his niece, Lucy, Lucy Wedgewood, he devised quadrats where they would collect warm castings and then ultimately quantify how much soil and the form of worm castings is deposited per unit area. And then extrapolate over time. This makes it, of course, until that very last book on Earth Worms, they were able to show that up to 16 tons of soil per acre, or moved annually by the earthworms, which is truly, truly remarkable. Right? Um, one other interest though, right? So worms as a geological force, but, but also again, there their intelligence, their predilections. If you visit Down House today, this is the parlor as you can visit it and you might notice something. Um, over here on the back on the piano, you'll notice a flower pot. And one might assume that in fact there are, there should be flowers in the flower pot. But no, the flower pots were Darwin's where Murray's, this is where he would keep his earthworms.

Speaker 2:          34:23          And this recreates one episode, uh, in the, in the late 1870s where Darwin, his son Francis and his grandson Bernard and his wife Emma, played musical instruments to the earthworms. Um, so we have Emma on piano. She's quite an accomplished pianist. I'm Francis on bassoon and the little grandson on penny whistle. And the idea is to sort of see, you know, what, what is, you know, do they have any musical appreciation? Can they hear even, you know? Well, um, well Emma, again, in her tongue in cheek style, she writes a letter to Leonard who is away. He says, father has taken a training. Earthworms, it doesn't make much progress. They can neither see nor hear, you know. Um, but nonetheless he was convinced that they do have the ability to sense the vibration and by moving the flower pot off versus on the, the, the piano.

Speaker 2:          35:09          Um, and ultimately to he devise experiments, giving them paper cutout so different shape and size and we document how they feel these shapes and how they make selections. They like to align their burrows with, um, with these things. And so you can see, for example, in this reconstruction that quite a few of these, a bits of cabbage and paper cutouts have disappeared. And you can kind of test their, their preferences for different shapes and sizes of these paper cutoffs. Exactly. The Way Darwin did well on that is really just, you know, the, the mirror asked introduction to though the weird and wonderful world of Darwin's experiment type thing. Um, again, I, I really do appreciate this opportunity to, to share this with you. Um, thanks so much for your attention to that.

Speaker 3:          35:57          And of course, thank you.

Speaker 2:          35:59          And of course very happy to answer any questions that you might have. Yes,

Speaker 1:          36:05          thank you so much for the talk. It was quite interesting. I didn't know any thing about Darwin, the man versus his science. Um, one thing I'm wondering is obviously Darwin was special in his time because he made a lot of discoveries and theories that turned out to be true that others did not make. So why was he special? I mean, what, what was it in his upbringing or in this person or something that made him do those things? Do you know?

Speaker 2:          36:35          That's a good question. I mean, of course he blundered a lot too. There were a lot of, um, false starts and dead ends as well. Um, he Darwin himself reflected on, on his, um, insights on his successes and, and he really thought that a, that a certain persistence, uh, was a lot of it. So He, if he special, it may be that, um, he really had a sticktuitiveness he would have an idea and really pursue that idea. I mean, just to the nth degree. He would, he would pursue ideas. Sometimes they just did not pan out. You know, he just blew it completely. But other times they ended up yielding incredible insights. And from a modern perspective, it's really interesting, especially for historians of science how many fundamental scientific principles and ecology and evolution have their basis in these very simple backyard experiments. But I think that a lot of it is really the persistence.

Speaker 2:          37:31          Of course he had the advantage to, this is with hindsight, right? But, um, he's one of the very few, maybe apart from only from the great Alfred Russell Wallace, his colleague who independently discovered the principle of natural selection. He had this evolutionary view of things, relationships in organisms, uh, hit the history, evolutionary history of organisms down the mechanism behind it, natural selection with that knowledge, the benefit of that knowledge, that guided many questions. Now the fact that he got so much right, right when he, he, he almost alone except for Wallace had this vision. And so he's really the only one asking such questions. So that also accounts for a lot of his success of you're about the only one investigating an area. You're bound to be making a lot of the first discoveries in, in that area.

Speaker 1:          38:23          Um, you mentioned a couple of his partners that he worked closely with in corresponded with and of course he had partner with his kids, it sounds like on some of these experiments, but was there, was there a larger network of scientists that he was a part of, sort of beyond call for, you

Speaker 2:          38:36          know, crowd sourcing, um, on a regular basis who are sort of interested in engaged in the same pursuits? Yeah, that's a, that's a good question. And I'm so, yeah, despite the fact that Darwin became quite a homebody, you know, he, he rarely traveled except maybe to some holiday destinations. Maybe he went as far as Scotland after his famous beagle voyage, but really very much stayed at home. And yet, you know, quite a few scientific visitors came to him. And his correspondence is about humanists, right? I mean, um, tens of thousands of letters. So he is very much a part of a scientific network that is global. And of course, once he achieves a certain level of fame, people are very happy to send in data, share information, and send specimens. In addition right there in London, London scientific society. He benefits from his buddies. You know, Joseph Hooker, uh, the botanist, you know, one of the leading botanists have his day in the UK.

Speaker 2:          39:31          Uh, certainly, um, is the director of Kew Gardens. And Q is perhaps at that time, you know, the greatest center of, you know, global center of living plants and from around the world. So Darwin is able to do a lot of experimenting on plants that hooker would very kindly just Lendon, you know, so here you have the greatest national collection at your fingertips, you know, fabulous. And for quite a few other, um, you know, London was very much the center of, of British scientific society. And um, he was never very far away. He would sometimes go into the scientific societies to meetings, reading papers, but just as often they would come to him. And so, um, I think it's fair to say that he was very much globally, uh, certainly nationally and also globally connected even though he rarely left home all over. This is all a part of course from the crowd sourcing.

Speaker 1:          40:23          Yeah, I was, I was thinking of a question before you've sort of got into that, about that idea of, um, geographically w what do you think were the advantages besides this proximity to London, of Darwin doing his studies where he did them? Do you think that there's something about the ecology of, uh, the sort of British isles that gave him an advantage? Or do you think it, it really was more just, um, being able to tap into that global network that sort of, the British empire had at the time?

Speaker 2:          40:55          That's a good question too. I would say no, there's nothing. I don't think that there's anything really special about the place. In fact, in some ways it's actually not a very good place to conduct certain types of, of experiments. Um, there are certain groups of organisms that are very low in diversity, for example. Um, I think it more has to do with, first of all these types of experiments, they really can be conducted almost anywhere, right? So there is that, but beyond that, nothing in my opinion, very special about that geography, you know, immediately there. So therefore benefiting more from, um, from his, uh, his place in society, you know, proximity to London. Um, his, his good friends who were really leaders of British science at that time. And then his ability through his own fame and accomplishments, um, to, to attract, uh, the, the, the support of people around the world.

Speaker 2:          41:51          He had good friends here in the u s um, he had, um, a global network. I think that was more important than the, than the particular geography. The geography turns out to be a tremendously interesting and important, but, uh, but I don't think that it itself set the stage for the, some interesting experiments necessarily. Maybe with one exception. And that would be earthworms in any glacial landscape dry. So not so here. Right. In northern North America glaciated landscape, um, earthworms were extra Paden. Right, so you're knocking, you don't have nearly the same, you know, there were, there are exotic worms introduced here, but the native fauna was expert paid it in the last glacial maximum. Um, so that did not happen, you know, um, where Darwin lived and so, so maybe at least the earthworms dependent on that geography. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          42:41          Yeah. Thanks for speaking. Um, my question for you is why is Darwin such a popular figure in even modern era? Like there's a lot of sciences that did a lot of amazing work such as Mendel Hooker and we don't really know their name off the top of our heads, whereas Darwin, even though he seems like he's very much of a homebody and he's not like a fun, quirky kind of guy, um, everybody knows who he is even today. So what is it about either the volume of the work he created or the type of work created that made him so well known? Far and wide?

Speaker 2:          43:15          Yeah. Now that's a, that's a very good question as well. I mean, I, I think that it has much to do with um, the very subject itself. You know, Darwin becoming associated, you know, just inevitably with this idea of evolution by natural selection. And no, as I showed here after the origin book after book, I mean he really is reinforcing and extending. So I mean he, he truly saw the implications for this idea and he sought it out in all of these areas. So, you know, he used to be maybe commended for really solidifying and extending a body of knowledge or a certain way of understanding the world. Um, but at the same time, I think you all recognize that, um, in some parts of the world, you know, uh, including in our country, right? The, the idea, um, is polarizing and Darwin also became the kind of therefore poster child for an as sort of a, it's a, it's a caricature really.

Speaker 2:          44:13          But this idea that, um, that, that the scientific ideas must therefore be opposed to, um, to, to religion and society. Um, some of some elements of that we're seeing in British society and the late 19th century. Um, and it'd be really became rekindled and intensified and the 20th, especially in the US, I think that he represents that idea that some people find, um, deeply distressing, disturbing, blasphemous, whatever, however you want to put it. As far as the, as the sort of poster child almost for this idea, uh, he then becomes iconic. And, um, and I, I think that that's a lot of it as well then. And as is as true in the history of science generally. Um, it's unfortunate but true that there are just a select few individuals I, for whatever quirky reason, end up becoming household names and representing whole, vast disciplines that actually have armies of very talented investigators beat behind them. Um, and those investigators are unsung typically outside the field, perhaps, and a and unknown. And certainly with Darwin, it's, it's all on a whole different scale because of the societal implications of, of these ideas, I believe.

Speaker 3:          45:28          Thank you. Everybody.
