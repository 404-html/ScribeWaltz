Speaker 1:          00:09          Scott, welcome to Google coming in. Perhaps you could tell us what got you interested in space. Well, first of all, I'd like to say it's great to be here. So great to be anywhere with gravity because now I can sit down. Can't do that in space. It's one of the space station. I changed position so many times you would have thought I was running for president. Maybe I should have. So to those of you in the audience that do not appear to be space alien aliens, I'd like to say good afternoon until the rest of you might come in peace. What I'd like to do first before I talk about like what got me interested in becoming an astronaut, I want to read from the book but a little bit because uh, you can hear it in my own voice and then you don't have to go out and buy the audio book. I know these are expensive.

Speaker 1:          01:05          Let's start at the beginning of the story. It's only gonna take about five minutes and starting the beginning of the story and uh, it's really sort of the end of the story cause I got home and this is about 48 hours after I got back after being on the space station for an entire year. I'm sitting at the head of my dining room table at home in Houston, finishing dinner with my family. My longtime girlfriend Ameco now my fiance in the back of the room and my daughter is Samantha in Charlotte. My twin brother Mark, his wife Gabby, his daughter Claudia, our father Richie and Amico son Corbin. It's a simple thing sitting at a table and eating a meal with those you love and many people do it every day without giving it much thought. For me, it's something I've been dreaming of for almost a year. I contemplated what it would be like to eat this meal so many times.

Speaker 1:          01:55          Now that I'm finally here, it doesn't seem entirely real. The faces of the people I love that I haven't seen for so long. The chatter of many people talking together, the clink of silverware, the swish of wine in a glass. These are all unfamiliar. Even this, the sensation of gravity holding me in my chair feels strange and every time I put a glass or a fork down on the table, there's a part of my mind that is looking for a dot of velcro or a strip of duct tape to hold it in place. I've been back on earth for 48 hours. I pushed back from the table and struggle to stand up feeling like an old man getting out of a recliner stick a fork in me. I'm done. I announced everyone laughs and encourages me to go get some rest, so I go to sleep.

Speaker 1:          02:45          Then I wake up a few hours later with flu like symptoms, not feeling very well at all. I struggled to get up, find the edge of the bed, feet down, sit up, stand up. At every stage I feel like I'm fighting through quicksand. When I'm finally vertical, the pain in my legs is awful and on top of that pain, I feel something even more alarming. All the blood in my body is rushing to my legs. Like the sensation of the blood rushing to your head when you do a headstand. But in reverse, I can feel the tissue in my leg. Swelling. I shuffle my way to the bathroom, moving my weight from one foot to the other with deliberate effort. Left right, left, right. I make it to the bathroom, flip on the light and look down at my legs. They were swollen and aliens stumps. Not Legs at all.

Speaker 1:          03:37          There. No kids in here, right? No kids, no kids work at Google. Not yet. Oh Shit. I say Ameco come look at this. She kneels down and squeezes one ankle and it squishes like a water balloon. She looks up at me with worried eyes. I can't even feel your ankle bones. She says it was about 400 pages after that. But anyway, so how did I get interested in becoming an astronaut? I want to be in space. I'm that. Yeah. So you know, I was this a atypical kind of person, kid that became an astronaut. Because when I was younger, I was a really bad student. I didn't do well, not something I'm proud of. I spent more time looking out the window, wondering what was going on outside or looking at the clock, trying to will it to run faster just so I can get out of the classroom than I ever did.

Speaker 1:          04:31          Paying attention in school. I managed to graduate from high school in the bottom half of my class and I went on to college because I was supposed to go to college. I thought, um, actually went to the wrong school. Now I don't mean I went to this school thinking this one over here was a better fit for me. What I mean is I applied to and got accepted to and showed up here thinking I was going to this other school, quite possibly the only person that has ever done this. And I get to my college and I'm there for a few days and I'm like, Hey, when's the uh, football game? And they're like, we don't have a football team. That's that other school in Maryland. And I was basically, you know, doing the same thing I did in high school. It was impossible for me to pay attention.

Speaker 1:          05:22          I think if I was a kid today, I'd be the kid with add or Adhd and maybe I would've gotten a little bit more help because we know what that is. I couldn't study, wasn't doing well. Eventually, I'm really not even going to class. One day I just happened to be walking across the school campus and I go into the bookstore, the college bookstore to buy like gum or something. Not a book, was not a big reader. I walked into the bookstore. I happened to see this book on the end of the shelf. It's got this red, white and blue cover. It's got a really cool title, made me pick it up, not this book made me pick it up and looked at the back interested enough and what the bank said that I looked through it. It took my gum money, purchase the book, went back and laid on my unmade dorm room bed for the next three days and read the stories of the fighter pilots that became the test pilots that became the original Mercury Gemini and Apollo astronauts.

Speaker 1:          06:20          The book was the right stuff by Tom Wolf. I think a combination between, you know, what these guys were doing and how Tom wrote in this creative nonfiction way just captured my imagination. And I felt like I had a lot in common with those guys, the early astronauts and test pilots that became astronauts, uh, with one exception. And that is, I was a bad student. I couldn't pay attention. And I thought, you know, if I could fix that one thing, solve that one thing, maybe I could be like that. And maybe I could go up and fly airplanes in the navy, land on an aircraft care. Maybe if I did well at that, I could become a test pilot later, possibly an astronaut. And then, oh wait, you're thinking, you know, 18 year old kid reads a book, decides he's going to become an astronaut. You know, it's kind of science fiction.

Speaker 1:          07:08          It's a, you know, it's a giant leap. Really what it was. Well, you know, it started with something very, very challenging, very hard, which was to teach myself how to pay attention and study. Once I figured that out, it really became a bunch of very, you know, smaller, manageable steps always with, you know, opportunities to fail, but always somehow managing my way back concourse. And if you consider the that I read that book at 18, uh, fast forward 18 years later, I was 36. I was flying in space for the very first time as the first American astronaut and my class of 35 people to fly. That's a pretty remarkable comeback. That for me is even hard to believe. Thank you. Bye. [inaudible] I know the whole book is absolutely fascinating. I, I wanted, um, if you could talk about suddenly, I know a lot about the international space station itself and you spent a long time, you ended Austin.

Speaker 1:          08:07          What's it like living on the ISS? Well, it's a, it, there's a few things about it that, uh, come to mind, right? It's a fun for one, you know, you're floating, which, uh, after you getting over the novelty of it being fun, it's, uh, makes most things harder to do. You know, there's a few things easier. I always say there's two things easier to do in zero gravity, moving heavy, heavy objects and um, you know, getting in the awkward positions like the hookup, the Kodak Schaible on your TV. Much easier when you can turn upside down or sideways. Actually I said this to a kid last night and he pointed out a third thing and he said acrobatics is also easier. Absolutely right. Everything is harder. Um, because you can't put anything down. No you're lucid. Even brushing your teeth is hard. You know, you have the toothpaste, the toothbrush, maybe a cap on the toothpaste and then you have nothing to do with the toothpaste after you brush your teeth cause there's no sync.

Speaker 1:          09:14          You can either spit it out into a tissue which is uncomfortable in zero gravity or you can swallow it people half the people do one thing. I swallowed my toothpaste for a whole year, which I don't recommend. Um, you also have an incredible view on the space station, but it's a hard place to live and work when you made me wouldn't be hard for you guys cause you guys spend a lot of time at work. Um, but they make it really nice that you want to spend time at work. Um, but when you go to sleep, you're at work. When you wake up, you're at work. You can't go outside, no son, no wind, no rain, no freedom of choice to do what you want to do, when you want to do it. Um, challenging because you're living in this very risky environment. You always have to be ready for an emergency even when you're asleep. Um, but it's also this magical place. It's like living in Disney world. The space station is a very big, um, a million pounds size of a football pitch, a, uh, internal volume of a really big house. So you never feel like closed in. Um, but it's a, it's a privilege to have spent for me 500 days of my life there.

Speaker 2:          10:27          And the last time you went back that year long study was designed to find out how people cope in space. So we wanted to go to Mars. How would, how would humans cut? And, um, you know, what were the lessons that you brought back from that? What, what was the science that we actually found it.

Speaker 1:          10:44          So this year long mission, the idea behind it, you know, many of you might be aware, we generally send astronauts up there for about six months. It's usually like four to five and a half. It was how the schedule works. But um, NASA started talking about sending an astronaut and cosmonaut to the space station for a year with the idea of, you know, some day we're going to go to Mars to get to Mars. It's going to take 200 days to get there. You'll have to spend a year on the surface. So, you know, you're not in zero gravity, but essentially you're still kind of in space. You know, Mara or Mars doesn't have much of an atmosphere. It's got a third of the gravity of Earth. A lot of radiation is going to take you 200 days to get home. And there are things that happened to us in space, um, to our physiology that we need to understand more about bone loss, muscle loss affects on our vision affects on our immune system, the radiation effects on us at a genetic level.

Speaker 1:          11:40          So we wanted to study this for a longer period of time and study it while we have the space station, which is an incredible facility to do science before we lose that in the next, I don't know, six or so years. Um, so the idea behind this year long mission is to someday go to Mars and there was also a psych component, so it was a, excuse me, me and this Cosmin not up on the space station for a year. There's also the side study with my brother and I because he's an identical twin. NASA has had the data on him since 1995 he's familiar with how things work. He spent some time in space, um, as well. Eh, he flew four times. He spent 50 days in space. So I would say 50, compared to my 500 every chance I can show that there's competition.

Speaker 1:          12:29          No, no competition. All um, yeah. So the idea behind this genetic study with my brother and I is to see how the space environment, the radiation, the stress, the micro gravity perhaps affects us genetically and they have found some interesting results so far. Right. And that's a look quite longitudinal study. I think. Yes, it will go on for the rest of my life. And uh, you know, the way Nasa Science Works is, uh, you know, it's not driven by like investments and schedules and trying to get results out because you're in competition with somebody else. So generally takes a few years. So generally from the time you collected data, it's like three to five years to a result. Okay. So you would've got to the ice ass a cool. So tokens through it probably stacks all of finding out that you're going to be on a mission. It was to actually arriving either facilities or doesn't see a lot of training.

Speaker 1:          13:25          Yeah. The training that they would up to. Yeah. So I became an astronaut in 1996 after spending time in the navy as a fighter pilot, flying the f 14 tomcat. Um, and then as a test pilot in the navy and then I went on to NASA. Then for the next few years I'd be basically to get a phd and the space shuttle, because it's the most complicated aerospace vehicle ever built, 2000 switches and circuit breakers inside, you know, some of which have you throw a switch or push a button at the wrong time. You blow the thing up, you, your crew members along with you. And uh, yeah. So I spent most of my time over the next three and a half years, just, you know, for this kid that probably had add, you know, learning how to fly this most complicated thing was a challenge. Like worked really hard at it, happen to get assigned to my first flight.

Speaker 1:          14:15          Not in a traditional way. You would think you would come into a large room and somebody would announce that, uh, hey, you've been assigned to this mission. Congratulations the way I found out as the commander of the upcoming mission. I was going to be on this Hubble Space Telescope repair mission had me, he said, hey, come in this office, I need to talk to you. And I had never really talked to this guy before. He was this space shuttle commander kind of, uh, you know, had a little bit of reputation. Um, and he pokes me in the chest and he goes, you better have your shit together because we're flying in space in six.

Speaker 1:          14:55          Yes sir. I'll get my, I kept my shit together right away and we trained for, we wound up flying nine months later because of some delays, but you know, pretty soon you're, you've kind of made terms with your situation, you know, you consider the risks that uh, you know, after this last accident we had you, you have a one in 70 chance of dying on this flight. It was kind of like, if I took a deck of cards and you know, left the jokers and all the extra cards in it, I threw it out in the audience. A couple decks of cards. Everyone that got the ace of spades didn't go home tonight. And that's how risky it is, demonstrated risk. And uh, so you think about that leading up to the your first mission and even subsequent missions. Every flight. I always wrote letters to my family.

Speaker 1:          15:42          I would give them to my brother and then when I came back he would throw them in the garbage. And the idea was if I didn't come back, he would hand them out. And I did the same thing for him when he flew. Pretty soon you're heading up to the launch pad on your first flight. Mine was on the space shuttle Discovery and the launchpad has completely abandoned, uh, cause the shuttles, the giant bomb on the top of this hill fully fueled 5 million pounds of liquid oxygen, liquid hydrogen, two solid rocket motors, uh, places abandoned it. W it, with the exception of you and your six crew mates and a few people that are going to help you to get strapped in. And you get in the space shuttle about a three and a half hours prior to launch, you get strapped in tight. You're lying on your back and your orange pressure suit.

Speaker 1:          16:26          The guys and girls that get you strapped in and they tell you they bolt the hatch clothes and take off and get about five miles away, clock starts counting down towards zero. And uh, you're getting all these systems ready for launch. The auxiliary power unit that powers the hydraulics, the electrical system, all the different engines, the main engines that you use for liftoff, environmental control system, which is the life support system, the computers, they all have to be perfect. Clock gets to nine minutes and it stops. That's to give you time to catch up if you happen to be behind and what you're doing. It's also the time you think, man, this is really stupid. Flying into space for the first time. It's not something you really expect to ever think you'd do for real. Uh, at least for me and this kid that couldn't do his homework.

Speaker 1:          17:15          Uh, and then the, but you can't get away, right? You're strapped in and hatches, bolted closed. Plus you wouldn't want to be the first astronaut ever run away from the rocket. I wouldn't look good on the fever. Now. It'd be a bad thing I am. That would not be good on your resume. Ran Away from space launch first ever. Um, clock picks up, it gets to a minute and then 30 seconds at 30 seconds of space shuttle computers take over the launch. Um, six seconds. The main engines light a million pounds of thrust, but you don't go anywhere. If you're bolted to the launchpad by these eight giant bolts, the clock goes five, four, three, two, one. Those bolts are exploded open simultaneously. The solid rocket motors are lit and it feels like the hand of God has just picked, picked you up off the launchpad and is throwing you out into outer space.

Speaker 1:          18:09          You feel every pound of that 7 million pounds of thrust. And I know if you've watched the shuttle launch on TV or been there in person, it looks like it's like lifting off slowly when you're inside. There is nothing slow about this. You get the feeling you're going somewhere, you're not sure where you're going, but you know you're not coming back to Florida. And after eight and a half minutes, you are flying around the earth, that 17,500 miles an hour floating around the earth and zero g. Now to contrast this with the shuttle launch, you know, or the Soyuz launch, the shuttle and the Soyuz, I flew twice on the shuttle and then twice on the Russian Soyuz and the shuttle was disbanded in, uh, 2011 was the last flight. It's like any wife launch to the ice is now the series. Yeah. So now our access to space for China has the ability to launch people.

Speaker 1:          19:07          They don't do it very often, but you know, the access to space for the rest of the world with people is through Russia. And the Soyuz and the shuttle are similar in that, you know, they both launch people into space. And that's where the similarity stops. My first Soyuz launch was in 2010 and then I flew my last Soyuz launch ever launched in March of 2015 for this year in space. Mission landed, um, a year later practically. And just to contrast, I'll tell you a little bit about the Soyuz launch. So he was a smaller than the shuttle also, you know, a bomb on the top of a hill fully fueled with liquid oxygen and liquid kerosene is the fuel they use instead of hydrogen and a you getting a similar, you get in a bus and head up to the launch pad with your crew mates saw uses a bomb on the launch pad on the top of this hill, just like the shuttle.

Speaker 1:          20:06          But you get up there and the place is not abandoned. There's like a hundred people up there milling around the base of this fully fueled rocket. All this vapor coming off the thing and the Russians, you know, and I, I tell a few jokes, jokes about the Russians, but I have a lot of respect for the cosmonauts and the people I've worked in the space program with. You know, just different cultures look at things different ways. And you know, what's very important to a Russian is if your friends are going on a long trip, you're going to be there to say goodbye. Even if it's at the base of a fully fueled rocket. So there are a hundred people up there and you're just trying to get through them to get to the launchpad. Some of them are smoking cigarettes. Swear to God. You're like, that guy's smoking.

Speaker 1:          20:52          So you want to get in that rocket as fast as you can because there's an emergency escape system up on top. Thanks. He had a rocket blow up on the launchpad and killed like over a hundred people. Then they still allow smoking up there. Um, she get in and it's, it's cramped, it's loud, it's hot. You're visors fogging up, you're all strapped in tight. A few hours before launch, there's no countdown clock and the he was, they didn't seem to need to put a countdown clock in there. This was going to be one of the rockets that like launch nuclear missiles during the Cold War. After awhile you're like, Hey, what time are we leaving? It's like 10 10 right. Does that Moscow time or biking or tone? Eventually someone comes up on the radio and says ignition, and I could just picture that guy smoking just running out there with him with his light.

Speaker 1:          21:49          Half off you the same question. Yeah. And then you know, you do lift off slowly in the Soyuz cause there's no solid rocket motors, but still within nine minutes you're flying around the earth at 25 times the speed of sound. I quite liked you talked about the rituals, uh, as you, as you go, the questions have so many and he seemed to be what the first time and then when his dad that keep doing that, you could talk through a couple of the stranger ones, you know? Yeah. The Russians are a little bit more superstitious than Americans I think by culture. But we also have a superstitions in the u s space program as an example. After you get suited up and your orange space suit you, uh, you play a round of, you play a card game, low ball poker. It's got a specific name.

Speaker 1:          22:35          I forget the name of it. I think I may have mentioned in the book, but I'm, the commander of the mission has to lose or you can't leave the building. And if he is doing really well it's people start to get nervous because she was looking at his clock and you have to be walking out at a certain time because you have the schedule, the keep and if the guy starts keeps winning, you know, eventually what you do is you kick people out of the game until eventually it's just like one on one. But I've seen people that keep winning and I not say that. So He's, my luck is bad luck is, yeah. Yeah. He has to lose. So he loses, he uses up his bad luck before you go to the launchpad and then 18 you'll also on the launch pad device, then you, you'll buy locks.

Speaker 1:          23:17          Just doesn't matter. Oh, but yeah, the commander represents the whole crew, so yeah. Yeah. It's just about him. I don't think it really matters if he wins or loses to be honest with you. But it's tradition. Um, and the Russian space programs, also traditions. We always watched the same movie, the white son of a desert or something. That's a comedy because they had an accident in the Soyuz. The next crew watch that movie and they never had another accident, so there'll be watching that movie all the way until they have another accident. Hopefully not. We also stopped the bus on the way to the launch pad and the same exact spot. Yuri Gagarin stopped the bus because he had to pee. So we get out of the bus, we undo our pressure suit. That's just been pressured check to extensively pressure check. We break the Seal and we pee on the bus tire in the same spot.

Speaker 1:          24:10          Yuri Gagarin and the FEMA national experience more buffalo with them as well? Yeah, they bring a bottle. I've heard they spray their water or in some cases urine if they're really superstitious. They brought some of their own urine with them so they don't have to completely get out of the suit. You know, it's funny though, people are like, wow, you do that pressure check and you spend all that time to make sure the suit suit works and is sealed and then you just go and do the whole thing and get into the soil. Soy Use. They say, I can't believe the Russians do that. And I go, we do the same thing in the u s we just have a bathroom on the launch pad, the last toilet on earth. And if you're leaving earth, you're going to be your damn well going to use that last toilet.

Speaker 1:          24:50          So you do the same thing. You get out of your suit, you pay, you put it all back on getting the shuttle and go. That's great. I mean lunch. That's awesome. That's great. Um, well, uh, I'm sort of interested with your given space. How did you cope with the isolation as a parent in the book where you talk about you were the only person in the u s section? Yeah, I mean it started, did, it starts off as a few. I've got the ads myself that will space. Is isolation trading something that you get taught. It's not something they teach you. They, they definitely make sure you're not like cluster phobic. When you do the astronauts selection, they'll actually, you know, hook you up with a heart monitor, put you in a small rubber bag, thick rubber bag, zip it up and push you into a dark closet and leave you.

Speaker 1:          25:38          They're not telling you how long you're going to be in it. And uh, he, there's no way you can fake not being claustrophobic and that environment. But they do check that, you know, I, we had a nap. He like, yeah, I got all asleep. It's not, it's not. Yeah. But I was fortunate in that I flew for six months before I flew for a year, which is good training for a year in space cause I knew what I was getting into. I actually liked being on the US side of the space station by myself. Um, not that I don't like the people on there with, but it's just easier in a lot of ways. It's very quiet. It's peaceful. When you put something somewhere, you know it's going to be there when you come back and have a very orderly. Um, so actually on this last flight, I was alone basically on the US side of the space station for about six weeks.

Speaker 1:          26:33          Okay. Yeah, it wasn't bad. I liked it. Um, and uh, but to answer your full question, how do you deal with the isolation? You have good connectivity with Earth. I mean, you could make phone calls, you have email, you have video conferencing capability. I mean, people are amazed at the, uh, the ability we have to communicate with the ground, which I find fascinating that people are shocked. You can have email and space. I'm like, yeah. You know, satellite communication, satellite, satellite, I mean with the Internet, I guess social media plays in increasing part and an astronaut, that public perception thing. Did you use social media the on I did. You know, um, before I launched, President Obama invited me to the state of the Union address and he, he, uh, during the address he challenged me to Instagram the experience. So, of course I tried to do that as best I could.

Speaker 1:          27:34          I actually thought it felt like, you know, engaging with the public with the, you know, social media was kind of a responsibility, you know, the public pays for this program and to keep them involved is important. It was also good for Ameco and I in our relationship for us to have something, it was kind of like a personal project to do that had, you know, daily feedback in how well you were doing at it. With like Mika worked in payoff when I said yes, she worked at the NASA public affairs, although they made her do this as a, you know, outside of her work hours, which is hard to believe that that was the case. But yeah, so I tried to engage the public. I often would have in my free time do some like tweet chats and things. One day, actually I'm answering questions on a Saturday on Twitter and President Obama, um, asks a question, he says, Hey Scott, do you ever look out the window and just freak out? And I'm like, no, Mr President. And I don't really freak out about anything except getting a Twitter question from you.

Speaker 1:          28:43          Within seconds, Buzz Aldrin jumps into the conversation and he says, Mister President, he's only in low earth orbit. I went, I went all the way to the moon. So I got trolled while I was in space. By the second man on the moon. It's like the greatest thing that's ever happened. Um, what's your next big challenge? I mean, sort of, you've, you've, you don't going back into space because Emily, that's that part of your life is finished now. You'll still have an involved in NASA. You'll on the bolt to decide who the next program I call my next big challenge tomorrow. Okay. Yeah. But she has been going one day after another, especially when writing this book. We've been on this book tour since October 16th with one day off on the weekends. Um, you know, it's challenging coming back after a year in space. You don't feel well, it's hard to adjust back to life without this very stringent schedule.

Speaker 1:          29:50          I went from being a government employee for nearly 30 years to basically a, an employee like uh, uh, I forget, I don't even know what the right term is. A small business owner with you know, dots. Yeah. Like a consultant and had to establish like very quickly to like kind of high end keynote speeches. I wrote this book which took like 18 months, wrote a kids book, did the Audio Book, signed 27,000 Tippins for this thing, you know, all these things. This has been one after another after another. So that come January I'll start to start to think harder about like, what do I really want to do for the next, you know, five to 10 years. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          30:35          Well I'd love to take some questions. Maybe I'll work for Google. We, I'm sure we would love to have you. So have a think about some questions and we'll pass the mic around. I've got one more. Are you talking to me? Let me think of this. So speaking and Google. So I'm in Russia and I'm the head of the national,

Speaker 1:          30:53          so office and Star City and my, I was like the lead Nasa guy there and the guy who's like the safety engineer, he says to me one day, he goes, hey, I want to show you something. He opens up his computer and he says, see this? And it was a little rectangular window. And I said, Google underneath. He said, see this, you should invest all your money in the right now. And I'm looking at it and I'm like, man, I don't,

Speaker 2:          31:24          yeah. How wrong was I? You talk about, uh, being in the astronaut office and being surrounded by these great astronauts of the history of which one was Senator Glenn. Yeah. I view ever thought about going into politics is that it's not a, is that something you'd be interested in? You know, I think

Speaker 1:          31:49          I would have a lot to contribute. The problem I have is, um, well, there are a few problems. One is that I'm neither a Democrat or Republican, you know, in the u s some, I'm not a registered independent, but I voted for Republicans. I've voted for Democrats. I'm kind of in the middle on some issues. I look like a Republican and others I look like a Democrat, but the bigger problem is in the United States, and I, you guys might not even understand this because this is a uniquely a us, perhaps a uniquely us thing, but we have two things that prevent moderates from a winning elections. Uh, one is called gerrymandering. Gerrymandering is when you create a political district that includes all the people of one party and you've, what you do is if you're that party, you sue the government to say, I'm going to take this swath, and it's going to be mostly Democrats, mostly Republicans.

Speaker 1:          32:52          And the people in the United States that run in the primaries are the hardcore people in the party. They're the extreme right? Or the extreme left. And if you're running in one of these gerrymandered districts, if you're a Democrat and you're running in a gerrymandered Democrat district, you have to be on the left side of the party, the extreme left. Likewise the extreme right for a Republican. So you can't even get on the ticket unless you're an extremist. And the key, you either have to be an extremist or you have to be a very clever liar, you know, you have to make, believe you're on the extreme, then somehow it's pivot to the center. Very, very hard to do. So it doesn't make uh, the situation, um, you know, acceptable for or workable for people that are moderates. Um, we have an independent party in the United States, but it's not one that's ever been very successful because of things like this thing called citizens United citizens United was a lawsuit, but it allows corporations to give unlimited amounts of money to political action committees that support candidates. So basically, you know, you become behold into these donors that are giving you tons of money and if you don't want of, um, the somebodies, you know, working for some corporation when you're really supposed to be representing the people, it's hard to win. But you did vote from space. I voted. It was that planning process. Yeah. Yeah. Pretty easy. I didn't have to wait in line, just pumped about it. Gap Questions. Must be questions. Yeah. This is kind of microphone on you.

Speaker 3:          34:34          All right. Thank you so much for coming to visit us. Really appreciate that question about the Hubble telescope. Uh, how was it, uh, how was it to work on? What's it like?

Speaker 1:          34:46          So yeah, my first flight was to huddle and it's uh, it's really big. It's like the size of a school bus, maybe bigger. One side of it that you rarely see is, um, I don't know why you really see this side, but once I'd always faces the sun just kind of like burnt, burnt to a crisp almost. And um, but it's amazing to see a, uh, an instrument that's been out in space for so long that has shown us more about at least the general public, more about the universe. Um, then anything else ever. Um, so I really enjoyed, uh, working on it. I didn't, I didn't do any of this space walks because I was a pilot of the mission. We actually launched right before y two K on this flight and December. And NASA had us land early cause they were worried that the computers on the space shuttle, we're going to divide by zero and we're going to go through some worm hole end up on the other side of the galaxy.

Speaker 1:          35:48          I'll have to wait another thousand years to see if that would have happened. You, you take it, see the outside of the space station quite a lot. And was that, you discussed how, talk about how that was kind of, you'd be seen a tiny asteroid will pop off. You had the opportunity on this flight to do a three space walks. I'd never, never done a spacewalk before because as a pilot or commander of the space shuttle, you just don't do them because it's risky and you're a critical to landing the spacecraft safely. The mission specialists are more expendable. Um, but yeah, going outside for the first time is pretty, pretty crazy. Um, neither of us had done a spacewalk before, so I was the more experienced guy. So I got to go out first and open the hatch and you open the hatch and earth is 250 miles below you and you're going 17,500 miles an hour and you're making sure your, for one it's hard to get out because the suit and the whole that is the hatch or like almost the exact same size.

Speaker 1:          36:49          So, and it's square, the suit's kind of square. But this hatch is round. It's like putting around a square peg in a round hole. It has to be perfect to get out. And it feels like at first you're kind of climbing down with your head down towards the earth. Although you know you don't have gravity so you don't physically feel like you're upside down, but visually you feel like you're upside down. It was interesting when I got halfway out, all of a sudden my orientation, my reference frame shifted. So now all of a sudden I felt like I was climbing out of the sun roof of a car and there was this alien planet over my head, like in a science fiction movie, like right there. And I felt like I was on earth and there was this alien planet and the look like it was just going to come crashing down upon me.

Speaker 1:          37:34          Wow. But I had to really focus so I didn't like lose anything or very distracting. That kind of situation. I think you talked about if you've lost focus and I went no longer tethered to the [inaudible] U. Dot. S You'd done w if you are a model an inch away as well, you know, in the u s suit, we do have a, a jet pack that has a little bit of fuel that you could potentially fly yourself back if you became detached. Um, it's challenging to use. Often when you're practicing this in a VR situation, you don't Miss, you miss the station altogether. And in those cases, you know, if you're an inch away and you can't reach, you might as well be a mile away. The results are still the same. Wow. He's got the microphone.

Speaker 4:          38:19          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          38:23          I'm interested, um, say hey, what the experience is once she returned to us off to you're in spice and was it how to, to kind of readjust from the mental or physical perspective? Yeah, so there's, you know, there's, I think two general adjustments. There's the physical and the psychological part physically. You know, at first you're, you're nauseous. Although, you know, I didn't throw up this time. I threw up after six months. Surprising. I didn't throw up after a year. I wish I could have, but I couldn't. I would've felt a lot better if I to just puking my guts up. I don't know if some of you ever saw pictures of me coming out of the, out of the soil. You sum it up. If there's one, I'll find one. Yeah. But anyway, I had this, you get essentially saying that UK book has different pictures, but I had this big um, big smile on my face when I got, when I landed and it was not because I was feeling well because I wasn't, I was just trying to look better than the two guys I was with was actually hoping to get an academy award.

Speaker 1:          39:26          But I understand they sometimes make mistakes so maybe next time I fly in space for a year, he talked about that day [inaudible] to Chaz for the Russian doctors. As I said, anybody wants to kind of walk. If you had to, you wouldn't walk. Well the first time I started walking I make a comment. There's actually this PBS special that just came out and they actually show the video of me and the tent doing some post flight test right after I got back and I say something like, Y'all, I'm walking and I'm like going like this. Like I'm walking like jar jar Binks felt like jar jar Binks. But you for the first few days, you're sore, your joints, your muscles are stiff. I had a, I was nauseous for a week anywhere my skin touched anything. I had rashes and hives for a couple of weeks. Like I said in when I was reading, when I stand, stood up, my legs would swell, I could actually see him swelling, no kid and just like us dealing all the blood, just infusing in the bottom of my legs.

Speaker 1:          40:23          It was like, and this is not good. Um, and how long did that take to get? I would say the physical stuff completely. A couple of months. Okay. The mental part of it, probably more like eight months. Because you live in this very controlled environment where you have a schedule that you are following, you know, every five minutes. Now sometimes the blocks of time that are dedicated to your activity are 10 hours. If it's a spacewalk other times, if it's throw the switch, it's five minutes. But you were following that every, all the time for a year. And then when you get home you don't have that anymore. And I both times after my long flights, I would find myself just sitting on the couch with all this stuff. To do, but because no one was telling me when to do it or what I had to do, I just sat there and it took a while to readapt to living on earth.

Speaker 1:          41:22          There are actually some good physical things about being in space for a long time and that is when you, uh, when you don't use your feet, all the calluses, they fall off. It takes a few months. It's kind of disgusting when you take your socks off and you get this big cloud of foot Dandruff, you never want to take your socks off in the vicinity of one of your crew mates. But then when you get, you know, after a few months you have these baby feet. And I, after my first long flight when no one knew who I was and that it was up there, like two days after I got home, I went to get a massage and one of these commercial massage places you at the end of the massage, they rub your feet, ladies rub my feet and she says, you have the softest feet I've ever felt in my entire life. All I said to her was, thank you, I'm very proud of them. And then I left. He's probably till still talking about that bald guy with the song. I think a question of hat

Speaker 5:          42:29          you've given the unique getting insane. What can we Russians and then I'd like to ask you about a, how would you like to see that those are the future of collaborations with Russia in the meant fight? Yeah. Yeah. I

Speaker 1:          42:46          think our space cooperation with Russia's is a great example of how to countries that at times we're enemies, sometimes not friends often conflict, but how we can work together in this international program for something that we both believe in, feel strongly about and do it as a team and in space. Uh, even on the ground working, preparing for space flight, any kind of conflict that we ever had our governments ever had does not affect our working relationship. You know, we are friends, we are colleagues. What is more important to us is supporting one another. Our personal safety, you know, we have to rely on each other sometimes for our lives that any issues between our countries. We never really even discuss much. Sometimes you do. Like when I was on the space station, it's when Russia moved into Syria and there was real concern that pretty soon, um, due to some kind of accident, you know, the u s and the Russian military would have get into some kind of skirmishes.

Speaker 1:          43:56          Fortunately that never happened. We talked about that on the space station, but it almost, we were talking about a kind of in an abstract way, like we were talking about not the United States and Russia, but like China and Germany. Um, and then we just realize, hey, this is on earth and we are in space and um, that those issues don't really translate up here. Misha Kornienko, Mikhail Kornienko, my, uh, Russian brother from another mother that I spent a year in space with. He said he would say a few times during the, he says, you know, if our country's ever want to solve their issues, we have with one another, all we need to do is put our two presidents in space for a year together. Although those two guys might like it too much. I just take one this table if in the back.

Speaker 6:          44:50          Hello. Very nice work. Congratulations. So w we are computer science, right? So whenever you watch a movie and there's a computer guy doing stuff, we look at that. So yeah, that never going to happen. That's not like that. How do you feel when you watch films like interstellar and Marsha, the Martian gravity, all these kinds of movies from space that we, from our point of view, oh that looks amazing. Might be like that. How do you feel about it?

Speaker 1:          45:16          Well, I watched all of those movies in space. You mentioned gravity. Yeah, maybe not interstellar, but I definitely watched the Martian and gravity in space. I actually, they sent us the Martian and a couple of days before it, uh, it came out and we watched it like a preview. I actually talk, talked to Matt Damon on the phone a couple of days before it came out and he was interested in what we were doing. It seems like he knew about as much, he knew him as much about spaces. Maybe George Clooney does. But uh, yeah, the Martian was pretty accurate. I think, you know, there was things, there are always things that are wrong with these movies. Like you know, that storm they had on Mars, there's like no atmosphere on Mars. You wouldn't have something like 800 mile an hour. You might have an 800 mile an hour wind, but it's not going to knock anything over, you know, because there's no air.

Speaker 1:          46:10          Um, and the other thing that was weird with the Martian as they always called the commander and the female commander on the rescue ship, they would call her commander. We're on a first name basis and then gravity, you know, gravity has got all kinds of technical problems with it, but it's exciting, exciting movie. Um, I think it's good that they took that licensed to make it really dramatic. We watched it on the space station and had this screen set up in the a node. One of the space station, which is a u s laboratory module is in the back. And um, it's Kinda like watching a movie of your house burning down whilst while you're inside of it. But there is the biggest regret of my whole year in space was we're watching that movie and Sandra Bullock in this scene with our short dark hair is floating through the lab module in her underwear and Samantha Christopher ready, this Italian astronaut woman with her short dark hair comes floating by in her like Spandex, like gym shorts.

Speaker 1:          47:24          She ran in and a tee shirt looking exactly like her and I'm thinking I got to get a picture of this and then I didn't because I felt like weird about it because you know she was in her gym clothes and Sandra Bullock was in her underwear. But it would have been the, they would have been the the biggest tweet ever from [inaudible] base. You actually, I think you talk about, I talk about that in the book compared with not Watney unfavorably when you, you let some flowers. Yeah, we didn't let the flowers and the system has some, if I was just, shit was just following national rules on taking care of, we grew some vegetables, a lettuce in space and we grew some Zinnias flowers, which apparently you can eat but you don't eat them. The idea being if you can, you know, grow a flower, you can grow.

Speaker 1:          48:10          Maybe something like a tomato that was grown, these flowers and just following the directions, water them, don't want it in a mortar them. There was so much time delay in the NASA system of looking at the photos about the condition of the flowers. When they would tell me to water them, they would be almost dead. When they would tell me to stop watering them, they would be covered, they would be wet and covered in mold. Um, and I was fine with that because it was, it's not my experiment. I was just doing what I was told. And then one day I post a picture of the flowers and some guy comes up and he says, you are no mark Watney fight was on then. And then I told [inaudible], I said, okay, if you want these flowers to live, you're going to have to just let me decide when to one of them because there's too much time delay in the system.

Speaker 1:          49:04          So I started like touching him and brought him back to life and got them really nice. Occasionally I'd take them down to the Russian segment and put them on the duct tape on their table is a little centerpiece when we were having dinner and they got a lot of attention and people like the flowers. One day Sir gave all cough Russian guy system and he goes, Scott, why are you growing these flowers? And I say, I say, Sergei, we're growing these. So if we can grow these flowers, maybe we can grow something that's more nutritious, uh, that we can eat to supplement our nutrition on the space station. Especially if we're going to Mars and go, the plan is, you know, we grow these flowers, then we can grow tomatoes that we can eat. He goes, why would you want to grow tomatoes? And there's just so we can eat them. He goes, you should grow potatoes, you can live on potatoes, you can't live on tomatoes and you can make vodka is a great guy. Uh, wait, one more question.

Speaker 4:          50:10          Yep.

Speaker 1:          50:12          Hi. Thank you very much for your talk. Very inspiring. Yeah. Can you show some thoughts about the potential of building a colony on Mars? The necessity, feasibility and maybe even timeline.

Speaker 4:          50:24          Hmm.

Speaker 1:          50:25          What about journey to Mars? Yeah, a colony to Mars. You know, I was asked a question when I was on the, on the space station by a reporter and the question was, now that NASA has determined that there was liquid water on Mars sometime during the year, will that help us get there any sooner? That, I don't know. Maybe now if we found money on Mars, that would help us get there real quick because that's what we need is money. Right. My brother often says, you know, go into Mars is not about rocket science. It's about the political science. You know, I think we know a lot of what we need to know too. Get the crew, a crew to Mars to support them on the surface. It's just going to be really expensive. And to do that you need, you know, representatives in government that are, that are science minded people that believe in science.

Speaker 1:          51:16          Um, we don't have enough of that in the United States. So, um, I think, uh, US getting to Mars is doable. I think it's doable today, but I don't think it's going to happen anytime soon. Um, because at least in the u s government, I mean, my concern is less about going to Mars than it is about members of Congress, not believing that 97% of the experts, scientists, um, are correct when they say we are responsible for in some ways responsible for climate change. That's a bigger concern of mine. You know, when you have people that are not, uh, don't come from a technical background and can say, I disagree with all these experts. I mean that's, that's arrogance to an amazing degree that we have to get past that before we can do anything like going to Mars someday. Do you think that it's, I, I have one more question on them.

Speaker 1:          52:17          Commercial space travel so we can kind of virgin galactic and space x, the space toys and seems to be inching ever closer. Do you think that whatever would use the whisk enough that that will happen? You talk about the one in 70 odds, you know, do you think that's where the risk lies? Absolutely. You know, absolutely. I think we are on a cusp of, of uh, you know, technological advances that uh, you know, whether it's in space flight or self driving vehicles, self piloted cars. I think, you know, we're kind of getting into a revolution, you know, certainly with space flight, you know, it's going to be risky. People will die just like in the early days of aviation. But, you know, hopefully within our lifetimes you're gonna be able to, you know, hop on a rocket powered airplane or whatever you want to call it and be a in New York in 30 minutes, which would be really cute.

Speaker 1:          53:06          Would you be fest fest in line for that? Uh, it depends on how much they paid me. Okay. Yeah. Let's take one more question. I think there's one more question then I want to just leave you with a final thought. Great. I'm not at the back. Thank you. Um, so my question is like, thinking about your entire career from first day at school to first time flying on your own first time in space, doing a space walk, like what was the biggest jump in scariness and did the previous jumps help you with that? That's definitely a career. Yeah, definitely. Building Block. I, you know, I would say the scariest thing I've ever done is landing on an aircraft carrier at night. You know, half the time it's terrifying. The other half is just scary. Um, the most like holy shit moment though would be the first time you fly in space in those solid rocket motors light and you feel every pound of that 7 million pounds of thrust.

Speaker 1:          54:05          And that's more than a holy shit moment. That's like a holy something else moment where it is so shocking that, and so surprising and so unexpected that when I, I flew my first flight like three years before my brother ever flew into space. So I had three years to explain to him what that was going to be like. And he was a combat pilot for the [inaudible] and the Gulf War test pilot, same astronaut class basically, you know, same DNA is me. I tried to explain that to him when he landed and the hatch opened and he came out of the shuttle. The first thing he said to me, I was waiting right there. He said, I had no idea what that was going to be like. None. I mean, that is how amazing. Absolutely amazing it is.

Speaker 1:          54:56          Thank you. So before we leave, yeah, fine. I'd just like to leave you all with a, you know, one final thought on my, uh, my experience in, in space and that is, you know, when I was leaving the space station, this is a space station. I spent 500 days of my life on over three flights. I flew my first flight to humble. It was a week. Second flight was two weeks, third flight, 159 days. Fourth flight was 340. Some smart guy told me that's a second order polynomial. If you graph it, if I fly in space again, I don't really come back. It goes asymptotic almost. Maybe it's like a five and a half year mission, but I'm leaving the space station. I'm looking at this thing out the window. What I can see from the little window and them thinking, you know, we built this thing a million pounds the size of a football field or pitch football pitch while flying around the earth at 17,500 miles an hour in a vacuum, in extremes of temperatures of plus minus 270 degrees built with this international partnership of 15 different countries, different cultures, different languages, different technical ways of doing things, put together by astronauts and cosmonauts in space in these difficult to work space suits, connecting these modules, some of which had never touched each other before on our first time they ever met was in space.

Speaker 1:          56:24          This is the hardest thing we've ever done. Absolutely convinced of it. Harder than going to the moon and if we can do this, we can do anything. If we want to go to Mars, we can go to Mars. We want to cure cancer and put the resources behind it. We can cure cancer. We want to fix our problems with the environment. Challenges in my country, in the United States, which there are many. I think they are all solvable challenges you guys have in your industry, in your country here, or wherever you may come from. I was absolutely inspired after spending a year in space that if we can dream it, we can do it. Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen. It's called [inaudible].

Speaker 4:          57:04          [inaudible].
