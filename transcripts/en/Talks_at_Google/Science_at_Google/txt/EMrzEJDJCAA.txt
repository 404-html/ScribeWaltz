Speaker 1:          00:06          I am very excited to introduce Diana cower and Diana is creator of the Youtube Channel Physics girl. She grew up driving tractors on a farm in Hawaii. I think you were just in Hawaii. Uh, surfing's scuba diving and playing the Ukulele. Ukulele today. I'm, I apologize for that. And with that training, found your way to science and engineering pursuits, nicknamed happy pants in college. I have no idea why Diana research dark matter with Professor Jasleen Monroe as an Undergrad at MIT and low Mattel mentalities stars with professor and Friable as a post baccalaureate research fellow at the Harvard Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. Say That 10 times fast. She worked as a software engineering intern at GE designing mobile apps and at Uc San Diego was a science outreach coordinator before ultimately becoming, you tube's physics girl fulltime. Please welcome Diana to Google.

Speaker 2:          01:02          [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          01:07          I had really colorful pants. All that's why I did. I had a pair of like, they looked like hippie pants and so one of my friends called me happy events because of that. Excellent. I did not know me now.

Speaker 1:          01:17          So, uh, this is definitely applied to me when I was in high school. Physics can send terror in the hearts of many high school students and is a really broad discipline. Just like engineering is a very blood, broad discipline. How would you describe physics to a middle schooler or

Speaker 3:          01:32          a middle schooler? That was, I don't want to think about that as a rough time in my life. I think it's a rough time for everybody's like everybody. Yeah. So the thing about physics, like I think when, when you think about physics as a class, do you think about like the equations, like you know, Newton's equations and you think about if you push something with a certain forest, you're going to get a certain acceleration. Um, but that like, it just sounds so lame when you describe physics like that. For me, physics is like, it's like all the things that you're interested in. So for a middle schooler it's, I dunno, like they're interested in their crushes and they're interested in like, like a sports maybe or their interests that they're starting to get, you know, makeup, curious or things like that. Um, so take some of those things like sports and a soccer ball will curve because of physics.

Speaker 3:          02:25          You can explain that with physics and then even like even makeup, you can explain iridescence the same way that you explain how a butterfly wing works or why I'm thin films like spilled oil looks kind of shiny. Like you can explain it these everyday things with physics and then take all that and make something that middleschoolers couldn't live without like their smartphone. Um, then on the other side of it, there's, you know, there's this like application stuff. Then there's like completely useless stuff that's really cool. Like the fact that stars can just explode supernovas and then become black holes. How does that work? Physics will tell you. And then there's like, you know, there's, there's the fact that a ball is really, really, if it's really smooth, you can kick it the same way and it'll Kern the opposite direction, which is really cool to see. I've got a video on it. Um, so like, so physics does this, it's like the useful and the useless. It, it explains all this stuff in our world. Like in literally explains why the sky is blue

Speaker 1:          03:27          and going to the other end of the spectrum now. So why should those in Washington and political power that control the budgets of public research care about physics?

Speaker 3:          03:36          I mean, I think that the, the typical answer that you would hear to this question is something like, all of the advancements we've had in stem and technology and engineering and science, um, have often been thought of as like kind of interesting but not necessarily useful. Like the light bulb is one of the most famous inventions that people thought was useless that we would never actually need like candles there. They're good enough, you know. Um, but, but for me, for me personally, I think that that like as art is just good enough for the sake of having arts in our lives, the same is true of like the pursue of fundamental science. So humans have been curious about our world. Like how, you know, we ask tons of questions all the time, like all of us, I know you do, we were just like curious about our world. And this has been part of being a human, it's been part of the human experience and civilization started. So for me that's enough of a reason to give funding and to pursue scientific research. Sure. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          04:45          Well I survived computer engineering in university and struggled a bit through physics in high school. What advice do you have for students who are struggling to grasp physics concepts? Probably more at the high school level before they run off to college.

Speaker 3:          04:56          Well, I would say

Speaker 1:          04:58          in addition to watching your videos, which really does help. Yes, yes.

Speaker 3:          05:02          That's what my videos are not going to teach you how to do your homework as much as you email me with your homework problems trying to ask. Um, um, I would say, I would say that that, yeah, physics like it's not, it's never going to be easy. Physics really is math heavy when you get deep into it. But like any kind of learning, I think you have to learn how to be a student more than you. I have to learn the material first. So if you're starting a class, you'd probably want to take a look through the syllabus and find your own questions, like find what you are curious about and that's the best way to learn. So when I do my videos, I learned so well because I have these questions and I'm curious and that's why I choose that video topic. So like, yeah, as a student you can have a teacher or a parent that's going to tell you what's interesting and what you need learn and they like, you're going to take this class because this is what's important for you to know, but like take it back into your own hands, like take control of your learning.

Speaker 3:          06:05          I looked through that syllabus, find some questions that you're interested in and you're curious about and that's going to help guide your learning through the class.

Speaker 1:          06:13          I think this ties this next question, which is at some point physics went from being a credit you had to get to being really cool. Maybe that happened really early. So what, what made physics called high school and Cooler once you got to college? What were these questions that were really burning in your mind that physics started to answer?

Speaker 3:          06:28          Well, physics was always cool for me. Like since I've, since I took my first physics class, it was like, this is it. Ah, um, but I th I think probably there, there were a ton of questions that physics answered for me. Um, starting with things like why is the sky blue? Like I found out that that blue light scatters more and I was like, well that's Kinda cool. I found out in the process that the sun emits all of the colors of visible light in addition to some of these other colors that are not visible. I thought that was fascinating when I first learned that x-rays and microwaves and gamma rays and radio waves are all the same thing is as visible light, which is, which is a thing that I still haven't got my parents to fully grasp, but I'm trying. But when I first learned that, I was like, you're kidding me.

Speaker 3:          07:17          Are you like, it's all light. It haul, it has the same properties. It's like the same phenomenon is just that we can't see it. That was cool. I was like, these are things about our world that the, I didn't know that a lot of people don't know, but physics knows, like we've discovered as you know, throughout humanity, as scientists and as curious persons, we've discovered all these interesting things about the world. Wait, I had some really awesome physics teachers, so never underestimate the value of like, you know, what you can, when you can do to instill the curiosity and the excitement on the young people in your life.

Speaker 1:          07:53          And maybe that's if you were talking to other physics teachers, what about those teachers you had made them so amazing?

Speaker 3:          07:59          I wouldn't say excitement was a huge part of it. Like I tell this story all the time, but Cathy Jones, oh, she was like miss frizzle but like really cool. Um, she had a ton of experiments going on during, during like the breaks during recess of our classes. So she had this one where she had a block of ice and then a cord going over the top of the ice and weights on either side. And then you wait throughout the day and we would come back in throughout the day and see the cord, like cutting through the ice and then refreezing over the top. So like midway through the day you've got an ice block with a cord going through the middle of it, just from the pressure pushing down and cutting through the ice is cool stuff. So she was like, come and see this all the time. Come share it.

Speaker 3:          08:42          And that's something that I have not done as much in my life. But now being a science communicator, I've realized like how important it is when you're with young people to share something you're passionate about. Like I dunno, carry around a little experiment or something and be like, when when you're with a little kid and be like, hey, come check this out. Like not in a creepy way. Just like, just like, like this is cool. Like, Oh, okay, I've got these earrings on. Sorry, I'm getting excited. I've got these hearings on that. We'll have to do a show until after they're there, like shrunken dime.

Speaker 1:          09:14          Oh, cool. Yeah. From the video you did on that. Yes. Cool. Video. Go check it out. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          09:20          So like I really like wearing these because every once in a while I get to take them off and show a little kid because they're like, they're shrunken by a giant electromagnet. Um, put it in the middle of, of the electromagnet and it shrinks the quarter. So you're like literally using a magnet to create current and shrink. Well it was originally a quarter. These were dimes. Um, but I mean earrings out of them so I could always carry around my lens with me.

Speaker 1:          09:44          Very cool. And that ties into this cool new video. You published a this morning, um, which includes a maker style project for a lightening generator. I, I've already promised my daughter we're going to do this summer. How was pursuing science help you wrestle through tough problems without giving up? Cause he your video giving you a lawyer a little bit, you know, you see the video of the end result. You don't see the three days of struggling to make this thing actually works at what have you learned how to science taught you to persevere? Maybe a dog.

Speaker 3:          10:12          Oh, lovely. And more, well, I conveniently deleted the three days of footage where we struggled on accident. It wasn't convenient. It was really sad. Anyways. Um, so yeah, this video was a homemade capacitor. So is it a cake pan? On the bottom is the bottom plate and then a piece of polycarbonate for the dielectric. And then, uh, uh, a bowl with a piece of sheet metal on the top for the top plate and then you charge it up by using a PVC pipe. Um, we struggled a lot with not having any innuendos in this video because, because the PVC pipe, you have to rub it with a paper towel back and forth and then deposit charge onto the bowl over and over. So, um, something I've struggled with in my channel on Youtube, you know, this inviting platform, but, um, anyways, I'm going off on a random tangent.

Speaker 3:          11:02          Bring the train back. So this was a really, really fun experiment. Um, but we struggled a lot with it because the video that we saw that inspired us to do this, how did like a 10 inch spark when you discharge the capacitor? And we were like, yeah, we're going to do that. It's going to be great. And our first mark was like half an inch and we're just like, why? Why is that not working? So we went through this process, we found out things like even the, like the little lip on the bowl we were using was leaking a little bit of charge. Um, so we had to use a smoother bowl, like so many neat little nitpicky things that experimentalists would know better than theorists. Um, so it was, yeah, I think, I think that this video for me was, was a really good way to bring it back to something that I love doing, which is like problem solving, learning through experience, like spending a lot of time on something and really trying to make it better. In the end, we didn't get 10 inches. We got four inches. Very cool. Awesome spark. Yeah. But we also happen to do this and like, like historical rainy conditions for San Diego. So like, it's the middle of the, like the rainiest month on, you know, the last few decades. And we're trying to do static electricity experiments.

Speaker 1:          12:16          Arizona. This is going to be even cooler.

Speaker 3:          12:18          Yes. Or if you're somewhere cold right now, like even in Tahoe or something, it's probably a really good time to do the experiment.

Speaker 1:          12:25          So anyone out there that does this experiment Hashtag and send your video on youtube to Diana. Yes.

Speaker 3:          12:30          If you can beat my four inches,

Speaker 1:          12:32          you won't win a like or subscribe or something. Sure. Uh, so a close friend of mine is a physics professor at Uc Irvine where he works on longterm research and high energy, high energy physics. I'm always impressed by the years of dedication. Physicist applied are really hard problems. What is the most exciting research you were following? The could possibly reach a conclusion in your lifetime or maybe not.

Speaker 3:          12:54          Yeah, I mean, I, I'm really shocked that, that in the last couple years we've had the discovery of the Higgs Boson and then, uh, gravitational waves. I'm guessing you guys have some nods if you've heard of both of those. Awesome. Yes. Um, so some gravitational waves was something that I had heard about in, in Undergrad. And they're like, yeah, well they're working on Lego, they're working on this detector. And some of the professors that I studied with were working on Lego and I was like, wow, like this is really exciting. Maybe in 20 years we're going to get a detection and we're going to get the discovery of gravitational waves. But we have like, that's so it's so exciting. Like those, those are the kinds of things I follow are like the big discoveries that actually make it to the um, main stream news I guess. Yeah. But, but in addition to that, some of this stuff that I have worked on, it's probably biases me to put paid more attention to that research.

Speaker 3:          13:52          So like I worked on a dark matter detection experiment and so we're hoping to detect dark matter sometime soon. Hopefully in my lifetime it may not happen, but I think that's the next gravitational waves. You know, like if we could detect it'd be bigger, it would be huge. If we could detect dark matter that would be like, you know, like the gravitational wave detection. It would just be amazing. Um, I also worked on Lowman illicitly stars, so like focusing on, uh, the early universe. So if we can, you know, we'll learn more about like how stars evolved as we discover more stars and look further back into the oldest stars. That'll be really exciting. Yeah. Just so much. There's too much.

Speaker 1:          14:38          So, uh, I'm going to start pivoting now to your becoming a youtuber and, uh, this is the timely, since when I'm in recent videos, your dad was in it. Very cool. He was struck by lightning twice, twice. That's a cool video. Yeah. I wouldn't want to recreate that particular, so I imagine the conversation with your family that you've graduated from Mit with a degree in physics and planned to become a youtube creator would be an interesting conversation. Um, imagine the path from MIT graduate youtube creator was not a straight line, probably had many dips in the polls and the failures along the way. What path did you take?

Speaker 3:          15:12          Yeah, so, um, yeah, my parents were not super excited. They were like, okay, hold up, like we have to pay for this, this degree from Mit. Like I think that they thought that I made pretty good life decisions up until the point when I got my degree. And then I was like, well, I'm starting a youtube channel. And I think like, she probably thought that it was like going to Hollywood or like maybe like a reality TV show on, on TV or something. I don't think she thought very highly of a youtube career. Um, and it's not like I thought that that would be my career when I started this. But like, she's like, you're putting your time into this. This is what you're, you're trying to make, go forward in your life. That's not gonna go anywhere. I'm just going to say it. Um, but, but as soon as I, I think that it's worth saying that I didn't just sort of drop everything and do youtube.

Speaker 3:          16:05          Like I was still working different jobs here and there. I was still, um, I was still working at Ge doing software engineering for a year and a half. I still worked at Harvard doing research. I worked at UC SD doing outreach there and then worked at a science museum. So I was never like, like on the streets. I wasn't like homeless editing videos, but I, um, I think I had this project though is on the side and it was like I'm going to put as much effort as I can on the side while being a responsible human being and having a job that's at least 10 generally related to what I want to do. Cool.

Speaker 1:          16:42          So youtube creators are fascinating because the learning process is documented online. In preparing for this interview, I've watched a lot of your videos. Of course, they're all terrific, including your earliest, which, which you said over lunch you don't watch very often. So when I interviewed Kari Byron, she mentioned that she didn't have any, uh, theater training and learned on the job. Was Theater ever in your background? What was your learning process to figure out how to be on camera, which is not necessarily a natural thing.

Speaker 3:          17:08          Yeah, I did actually did some theater. I did musical theater up until like middle school ish. And then after that I did, I did some performing, but it was mostly like I sang in an acapella group and inquires and I played the piano and stuff. Um, so I, I had some performance experience, but it was mostly singing. It wasn't necessarily like I didn't have a lot of speaking experience and that's something that I've done a lot more than I expected with starting. I was like, Hey, this'll be great. I'll be alone in my room filming in front of a camera. And then I started getting invited to speak to people in person and was like, wait a minute. Not what I signed up for. But it's, it's more fun I think, honestly, being in front of real people, there's more a reaction from the lens.

Speaker 1:          17:52          So at the end of the day you have to pay your bills. Like everyone else you talked to about how during the transition period, uh, you, you were, had sort of a normal day job, you know, how did you, at what point were you able to say youtube is my career as opposed to youtube is something I'm pursuing and figuring out what and what made that possible.

Speaker 3:          18:08          So yeah, like you said, my very first videos are cringe worthy. Well, he didn't say that. I didn't say that. I mean I, I'll say it and they're still, they're still up there on youtube so you can check them out. But um, but I think that it's important to see, like I, you know, I learned so much through the process of doing this, um, and no one was going to be paying me or giving me any funding to make those videos. They kind of started as like skit videos more than they did. They were like nerdy skits. It was like, what to do with a physics degree. And then I stood on my diploma to have like that much height increase to stand up and get something on a top shelf or I used my diploma to like row about, which could be useful now with all the flooding and California.

Speaker 3:          18:53          Um, but uh, but yeah, I, I they were more, they were more skits and it didn't start out as like a science channel. It started out as something else. But once I kind of veered it into the science channel and I was like, I've wanted to do science communication. Um, I entered the flame challenge, which is the science communication competition and like video competition. And I won that, that got picked up by UCF news cause I was working there and then I, UC SD alum was working at PBS, um, and he's saw the article, he was like, Hey, we should get in touch about you working with PBS. And so now I'm signed with Pvs. I, they're my sponsors and they, um, I'm part of their PBS digital studios networks. So that was when it became like full time. I got funding from PBS, but like it was really like serendipitous. There was a lot of lucky steps that happen. Like if that hadn't seen the article or how to add an entered the competition, I wasn't going to enter. I was like, it's for scientists and I'm not, I'm not working as a scientist. And my advisor was like, are you kidding me? Did you ever do scientific research? And it's like, yes, he's like, enter that competition. I am so glad he told me to and made me do that. Cause it ended up, you know, this like lucky chain of events.

Speaker 1:          20:08          So for the, uh, over half a million subscribers and many more millions of fans you have. Describe a typical week as a youtube creator. If there is a typical week.

Speaker 3:          20:18          Um, well I answer a lot of emails just like everyone else and it eats away at my soul. Um, I, I, I would say that, you know, there's a pretty typical schedule that goes from like doing research to editing, to animating, to like putting up a video. But there are some unusual times, like I still, I have deadlines, um, with PBS and so I still wait until the last minute and I'm up until 4:00 AM like I was in college, uh, finishing that video that needs to go out the next day. So I still do that. I'm still like every once in a while there's some audio missing. And so I'm like in my closet recording the voiceover, which conveniently it has good soundproofing cause there's all the clothes hanging around. So sometimes I'll just go in there. So you can imagine this is what you could, should imagine physics girl. Like I sit in my closet on the ground with my recording equipment and I'm like the capacitor.

Speaker 1:          21:20          So that's part of what the job is like. So what video are you most proud of? Even if it wasn't your most viewed, which is probably your most viewed. It's still in the vortex videos. Yeah, probably. But what do you most proud of? Even if it wasn't your most viewed video?

Speaker 3:          21:33          Um, well I'm pretty, I'm pretty proud of the one that I just put out. Yeah. Cool. I, I think it came at a time where I was feeling like, like it's starting to get to like a routine of making videos and this has been my hobby and now it's my career. So for it to get kind of routine is like I was having a little crisis for awhile. I was like this, I can't, I can't have it be like a career. I can have it. Well it is, I mean I can't have it be just like to routine and, and, and get to the point where I'm losing interest. So this video for me, it was like I'm going to sacrifice a few sleepless nights to spend more time making this experiment and working with my, uh, my intern on it. And so like having that kind of fun back and forth, I don't know. And so I'm really proud that I made the effort to take a step back from the schedule and the routine to do something that took more effort and took a lot of failing. And I'm pretty proud of that process.

Speaker 1:          22:29          Well, we'll send a maker element of it was, was really cool. So as was a fan of your table more and more and more. It's awesome. So has it gotten easier, harder, and you've kind of touched on this just a in the last question is you've gone from tens and followers to half a million plus plus plus.

Speaker 3:          22:43          Yeah, I would say that it's probably gotten harder. Um, I, I think it's like, uh, like I feel like the more I, the more I do, the more I want to do and I want to like, it's like working out, you know, like as you get stronger the more you want to lift, I imagine. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          23:05          I also imagine, I also know, I mean I do go to the gym

Speaker 3:          23:10          darn time, but I'm more of a runner. Um, but I, yeah, like, like the more I do, the more I like, I want to push myself and I want to make better videos and longer videos. And so I feel like instead of like, I have a very experience I can, I can sit back and it's easy. It's more like I just want my videos to be better and better and improve more and more. And I feel more of that pressure as the audience grows too. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          23:35          Um, so how do you calibrate the level of detail and complexity for each video, which cover wildly divergent topics. And what role does feedback from your audience play? One, which I assume you get lots of feedback across the whole spectrum.

Speaker 3:          23:48          Yes. Oh, those commenters. Um, yeah, some of the feedback is, is really good. Um, there's one comment that stands in my mind and it was pretty trolley but, but like came at the right time. So I had made some of these videos and then I made a science video. Science should video and then I made some more skit videos and um, the name of the channel back then was actually physics woman, but I was like, I'm too, I'm not mature enough for that name. So, um, so someone was like, you had a good idea what the channel with like the science theme and making the science content, you should have stuck with that. And I was like, hmm, yeah, maybe they were right. Like I, I, I hadn't thought of making a science specific channel, but that helps me lead. That helped lead me to the thought process.

Speaker 3:          24:41          Um, but at the same time, there are comments that frustrate the crap out of me. Like I made a video about why mirrors flip appear to flip things horizontally and not vertically. Um, which is an interesting question and it's something that Fineman thought about and wrote that he did like an interview about it. Um, I asked, I was living with at the time with a number of physics graduate students, one of them right there. Um, uh, and so I asked them, you know, I asked them this question and they were like, like, does it have to do with your eyes being horizontal? Or like they were thinking about the, um, the, you know, the diag, the optics diagrams. Um, and then I made this video and it's actually kind of a complicated answer. Um, and most of the comments were like, are you kidding? This is a video about how mirrors work. This is something you learned in first grade. And I was, I was blown away that people were saying condescending stuff like that. But also they were wrong. Like it's a hard question and it's something that I bet most of them wouldn't be able to answer when put on the spot. So, so like some of the feedback you have to take with a grain of salt,

Speaker 1:          25:49          uh, your video explaining why perpetual motion machines are impossible. What was terrific as a terrific video. What are the most common physics smiths you keep debunking despite all the videos you put out?

Speaker 3:          26:01          Well, yeah, there's the perpetual that physics is not cool. That's a good answer. That's a myth. Um, I don't really do a lot of debunking on my channel. I would say like I did, I definitely did that one, but I think that was maybe one of the only videos where I did debunking. And I think, I think partially that's, um, that's on purpose that, that like, I think questions are important to encourage and I think that, um, every time I see a good question, I make an effort to point out. That's a really good question. If it's not as good of a question, I'll still be like, thank you for asking because it's never going to be like a negative experience when someone has asked a question. So, so misconceptions are interesting to address, but I think it's more fascinating and more interesting to figure out why those misconceptions are common and why they persist. Oh, cool. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          26:52          Oh, so you mentioned any youtube posts. I think it was a Q and a poster that, uh, it can be a lonely job being a youtuber times. Um, there's a strong youtube community of creators that you tap into or is it collaborative, competitive? Uh, what's it like being a youtuber and that loneliness factor?

Speaker 3:          27:09          Yeah, I would say the day to day gets a little bit, um, a little bit lonely, although less so lately because I've started working with more people. Um, I, I have a team, but, um, but yeah, there's a big youtube community, uh, in science as well. Um, we're all spread out, which makes it a little bit difficult. Like, there's some people in Texas, I'm in New York and some in La, um, some up here in San Francisco, but, um, never have I felt competition with them. Like I've only ever felt support from bigger channels or kind of excitement towards smaller channels and, and you know, we always call each other and ask advice and we're like, what do you think about this title? And we're like, no, that's pretty boring or that, that thumbnail is bad. Don't do that. Um, so I think that we've, um, I think we've been much more collaborative than, than competitive and we all meet up foot at Vidcon, um, for the last couple of years at least I've gone and we like play board games and you know, it's as nerdy as you would imagine.

Speaker 1:          28:06          So, uh, this is probably affects everyone you tuber. Um, how do you know where to draw the line between your personal private life and the need to be engaged with your fans?

Speaker 3:          28:14          Yeah. Um, I, I don't have a lot of trouble sharing things. Like I don't have a ton of skeletons in my closet, so like I'm a nerd. It's out there and like I'm wearing a pie scarf, you know, everyone knows. Um, but, but I think, you know more, I'm worried about the people in my life. So like now that I have on the other social media channels, like Twitter and Instagram and Facebook, I'll get more personal, but I'll be more careful about like posting a picture of my sister or posting a picture of my friends because I'm like, you know, thousands of people may see this and you should know that before I posted, is it okay? And usually they're like, yeah, cool. So, um, so that's, that's more of what I worry about. But as a science host, people aren't so much into like my day to day life that it's more about like we're sharing the science and like we're exploring the science together and yes, I am a person who does science and there's some, you know, um, side effects. Like I'm, I, I'm a woman in a male dominated field of, of physics and of science communication. So like I get, I get people reaching out and being like, my daughter loves your channel and, and thank you for being that role model, um, for, for my daughter. So, so like in that way, like having the personal aspect of me as a person, being a scientist come out is a good thing, but I'm, people want to know what I do everyday. It's pretty boring. So in my closet,

Speaker 1:          29:46          pivoting off the, you know, the, the mom or dad reached docs, her daughters has been impacted. So how do you view your role in helping breakthrough this persistent myth about women and stem?

Speaker 3:          30:00          I think, I think that I'm making, you know, a small contribution. Um, I, I was just at a science teacher conference, um, in, in Virginia and then the teacher on the teachers there was like, I show your videos in my f my fifth grade class. Then they love the videos. And I was like, interesting. Like I'm curious how they react and I just asked the question because I wanted to know like how fifth graders at that age would react to physics videos. But she told me a different story, which was that when I first watched it, it was a video with, um, my, my boyfriend Kyle holding the stack of three balls. Um, and then you dropped those. And then I explain how that works and how it's like a supernova. So their reaction was cool, why is she talking? They thought that he should be the host and I should be like the assistant because that's what they typically see, um, is like there's a male host doing science. And, and she was really taken aback by that response with her class. Um, so was I, but, um, but, but I think that it was good and it started a big conversation with them. Like they realize, oh, this is her show, this is her idea. She has the science background. And it was a good opportunity for them to have a conversation about this and kind of break the idea of the stereotypes of what girls can do. So, um, I'm, I'm happy that those conversations are happening in classrooms.

Speaker 1:          31:22          So one more question from me. They're going to hand it off to the Dory in the, uh, the audience here. So I interviewed Emily Cowans Reli recently who is going to be unbilled eyes, new Netflix series. You also had a chance to partner with Bill Nye. Is He as cool and energetic as he appears?

Speaker 3:          31:37          He's quirky, very quirky. Um, yeah, I did. I filmed a video with him and actually I met him. Man, my life has taken a turn. I met him at the White House. I got, I was, I dunno how I ended up there. I probably won't end up there anytime soon, but it was good while it lasted. Um, so I, I was at the White House and Bill Nye was there. Um, this wasn't a dream, I swear. I mean they like it was, but it was true. Um, so, so there, when I met him, I, he was like, because texting and whatever, and I came up and I was like, Hey, bill. And I was holding my phone and he thought that I would want it to take a selfie. So he's really a lot of selfies. And so he grabbed my phone at 10. I was like, no, I just want to like talk to you.

Speaker 3:          32:26          I love you. So, so that interaction was, was he loves selfies. So that's my first impression. The second impression when we, when we worked together on a video, he's just like, he's very excited about science and he'll love to share like things he has like toys, he has like my earrings, you know, he's, he's like that. He's got that real kind of excitement for science. And then the third time I got to watch Emily's taping of villain I shows that was really exciting and he remembered me and I remembered him. So it was mutually good. Uh, yeah, it felt nice. Great. Cool.

Speaker 4:          32:59          Hi, very nice to meet you. My, uh, daughter and I are both subscribers and, uh, yes, exactly. What you mentioned about two questions ago. You're inspiring a young women to get interested in science.

Speaker 3:          33:09          Does she have her own account or are you skewing the results?

Speaker 4:          33:13          Uh, no, she didn't. She has her own account. She, she's uh, she's 14. One thing I've noticed though is I think when she was like 11, 12, 13, she was much more excited. Now she's 14, she's getting less excited about physics. What kept you interested and how can I inspire her to stay interested? What are you thoughts on that?

Speaker 3:          33:32          Yeah. Ah, that's such a hard question because cause like, you know, you can do as much as you want, but there's so many societal pressures on, on women, um, to not continue on with the sciences. Um, I personally had throughout high school I have these teachers that were just like, you are awesome at math, you're really good at science. And I, I remember so vividly when my, my astronomy teacher told me that girls who do physics are cool. And I was like, I want to be cool because at that point I had never experienced being cool. Um, so, so like it was the encouragement and it was, um, it was from my teachers. It was from, from some of my peers, um, to continue asking questions and to continue exploring. And I think like the investigation of, of, um, of questions about the world in addition to the, um, the support and encouragement of teachers was probably what carried me through to actually doing a physics degree.

Speaker 4:          34:34          If scientists march in Washington, will you be there

Speaker 3:          34:40          man, that's so mean. Like I try so hard not to get political on social media. Um, it's, uh, I mean it probably depends on my schedule, but, um, probably, yeah, I mean, I, I'm, I, I'm a huge supporter of science and the freedom of scientists to do the science, you know, the science that is important to them, um, and nothing politicized. And, um, and I, you know, I, I, I don't want to say believe in climate change because it's just a fact. Like it's just like the science is there. So, um, so like I, climate change is a hugely important issue to me and it's something that's, that's currently not looking good for being addressed by, uh, by, you know, politicians taking power. So, sorry, smarts. If you brought your own science experiment, that can be really, that's got to happen. Forget about any politics.

Speaker 3:          35:39          Just bring it, you know, to enter, you have to have a science experiment and it has to be cool. Yeah, that would be a lot of dry ice. I'll bring my, my like my atmospheric co two detector. Yeah, exactly. What would you bring them here and doing the science march will be your best experiment. That would be, that would work for walking. Like this is an interesting challenge. I actually have this experiment. I almost brought it today. I should have brought it. Ah Man. Um, it's a, it's a PVC pipe with a bunch of wires wrapped around it and then some LEDs connected to the wires in a circle. So it makes us a loop and then you just drop a magnet through the PVC pipe and all the LEDs light up. There you go. So that's like the big marching Bhutan, but it's like very nerdy. So that'd be perfect. All right. So we can make it very positive science marcher experiments. Another audience question.

Speaker 5:          36:25          Do you have a list of things you want to try out? And that list is girls, girls, girls, sort of Joe's. And do you like stop and say, okay, which video am I going to work on this week or this month? Or what's the procedure there? And also do you compare lists with Veritas, yum and smarter every day and say, oh, you also want to do this, this and these sort of crosspollinate or,

Speaker 3:          36:47          yeah, yeah. That actually happened recently because, um, I did a video on a anti bubbles which are like, oh, you guys are all nodding. Um, which are bubbles, sort of. They're, they're like, um, instead of a shell of liquid with air inside an air outside, they're a shell of water with, with, or a shell of air, sorry, with water inside and water outside. So they're anti bubbles. It's a more fancy name than the actual thing is. But I was talking with a destined from smarter everyday and he was like, oh, I wanted to do a video about something similar. So I put my video off as long as I could. Uh, but, but I shouted out to his upcoming video and he shouted out to mine. And Derek have from very task name happened to do one at the same time. So Destin shout out to his video like we all kind of keep track of what each other is working on.

Speaker 3:          37:38          Um, I really wanted to do a video about how big a building, how tall a building would be for the top of it to be moving the speed of light if relativity wasn't a thing. Um, and I was kind of looking through right before I was about to post it. I realize that vsauce had done a video of something similar he talked about. So it was like my goal, I'm putting out a video similar to yours. He's like, that's fine. Just do it. Like we're all, I think we're all very supportive of, of overlapping topics and we're all going to address things differently. Um, but for your first question, I do have a long running list and I've been sticking more and more things on it that are like go in the zero g plane or go to Antarctica or you know, so I'm not going to be able to do a lot of those things, but I'm trying, trying to make it happen.

Speaker 5:          38:25          Another story question, what kind of reaction does you channel get from people outside of the UAE? USA?

Speaker 3:          38:31          I have a, a large audience in India actually. Um, more so on my Facebook page then on my youtube channel, which is interesting. Um, I guess the same reaction. I think sometimes they're like, can you put some titles? Can you, uh, um, yeah, I mean I would say the reaction isn't much different for the international community. Like people ask the same kinds of questions, they ask the same kind of followup questions in the comments. They make the same kind of snarky comments about my sticky out ears or whatever it is rude.

Speaker 5:          39:10          Uh, since you're at Google, might as well ask this question. Uh, what's one feature you wish was added to youtube?

Speaker 3:          39:15          Oh, interesting. Well, the algorithm recently changed. So that led to part of my existential crisis because I'm on this, this is man, this is getting personal, but like I, I'm, I'm on this terrible platform where like my quantitative success is, um, is measured by like my views and my subscribers and then those plummeted recently with the algorithm change. So, um, I wish they would roll it back, but, but no, I'm just kidding. I really, I honestly think that that kind of was like a wake wakeup call for me and the one of the reasons why I did the most recent video because I was like starting to get into this routine and I was like, I need something that's like for me. And I'm really enjoying this for the purposes of doing it. And so I'm glad that, that I've, it's kind of made me move back toward that, you know, that approach to making videos. Um, other than that, uh, I, I don't know. I, I, I'm pretty happy with everything that's on there. There's not much I, I do on other areas that I don't, that I, you know, would it be able to do on Youtube? Like on, I used Dropbox and I use Google for other things and I use some of these other services, but I don't think I would want youtube to store my documents. I Dunno.

Speaker 5:          40:38          I love the collaboration. Yet there was a song about Newton and Einstein. I just hadn't realized you had seen background. Do you have plans to do any more physics songs?

Speaker 3:          40:45          Oh yes. Oh my gosh. So I don't know if, I don't know if this would actually like, this would probably be one of those cringey videos that I made earlier on, but I was, so, it was, uh, it was in the car driving with my boyfriend the other day and he wasn't paying attention to me. So I started singing, I started singing, but like, you know, bringing jobs on roses and I was started, I was like, what if you put, could put physics lyrics to that. So I was like, I was like classical physics and quantum mechanics. These are a few of my favorite things. So, so it was like maybe I could make a song out of that and make it go somewhere and it'd be really, really goofy. But maybe, I dunno, maybe I might do some more.

Speaker 5:          41:25          Uh, what were some memorable failures when you were starting your cheque? Clearly unprompted questions.

Speaker 3:          41:32          Memorable failures. Oh, well, I have, um, I have, I'm put some errors in my videos. Like I've had to literally take the whole video down and I've, you know, I stupid some, some of that stupid stuff. Some of it was like I actually had misconceptions. Um, so those were really good learning moments for me. But also like, sometimes it's just like I put an arrow the wrong way and I'm like, ah, that's so frustrating. Um, but fortunately the whole physics brigade is there to tell me when I'm wrong. Uh, another memorable error? Uh, probably not. Uh, remember with fairly when I was working at UC SD, um, I got this $9,000 grant for us to do some outreach projects and they gave me the tech and they presented it in this big celebration. And then I lost the check. Oh, I lost him. $9,000 check. That was meant for you. CSD outreach for kids. And I felt horrible and really irresponsible. And like everyone else, I got these grants, they were like, you know, older. They, they were, I don't know, probably in their forties or 50s and I'm like this 20th something that's like give me the tech, I'm going to do outreach, I'm going to leave this whole project of like science camps. And then I lost it and it was like, this does not look good, but they just issued another check and then I found it. Oh terrible.

Speaker 6:          42:51          In terms of platforms, so you sort of stumbled into youtube cause it was easy to do. You could sit in your closet, make your video and whatnot, but did you sort of look forward, there are lots of different channels to make content on. There's Amazon, there's Netflix, you know, maybe apple, you know, who knows. What are your thinking is on that front. Do you think you'll stick with youtube? What are the challenges, opportunities? How does that all fit in?

Speaker 3:          43:13          Yeah, that's a really good question. Um, I think that Facebook is, uh, you know, they're, they're pushing really hard with video right now and there, um, some of my videos do really well on Facebook when they don't do well on Youtube. Um, like the exact same video, we'll just get many more views. And now that might be view inflation. I don't know. It's hard to tell at this point. Um, but then other ones where, you know, cut down into a certain way that's more Facebooky and less educational, which to me is kind of like, uh, um, but that works well on Facebook and so that helps bring more of the audience back over to Youtube, which I think we'll probably always be my first love, but I would love to do more, you know, more shows that are bigger. I've got some ideas for, for like bigger projects, um, that would maybe work better on a different platform. I don't know. No, I don't do any PBS TV. No. I am PBS digital studios, so they only have youtube channels and then, uh, they're kind of separate entities. Well, I guess they're underneath PBS umbrella, but they're separate from the PBS broadcast network shows. Cool.

Speaker 1:          44:23          Well, I want to thank you for taking time out of your busy, busy, busy schedule, which I know is very busy from all the work into create in the awesome stuff. If you are not a subscriber, subscribe. If you're watching on our livestream where later on Youtube, go check out physics girl on Youtube, and thank you very much for sharing your story today.
