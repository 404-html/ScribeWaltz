Speaker 1:          00:06          Thanks for coming out of your, uh, lunch break today. I appreciate everyone being here today. I want to talk about, I want to give you a brief introduction to some things, some initiatives we're doing at the Monterey Bay aquarium, kind of our approach to problem solving and um, and how we're trying to inspire conservation of the ocean. Um, as thanks for the introduction, Kyle, as Kyle mentioned, I oversee our research and science groups and so I'm going to talk about some of the things that we've been doing for the past few years. Uh, one of the really important things to know about the aquarium is, and even I was surprised about this is we haven't been around that long. We haven't even been around 40 years that, but our roots go actually back pretty deep and our roots are kind of based in two institutions and one of them is a Stanford University.

Speaker 1:          00:53          This is the Hopkins Marine Station that started in 1890 to 125 years ago in Pacific Grove, California. They moved their initial lab, which is what you see right here. But what I love about this photo is that this is what a marine biologist looks like in 1892. Uh, it looks rather Victoria, but you still see the kind of the shenanigans of the people hanging out on the roofs. Everyone wants to be a marine biologist. Um, but not everyone knows what a marine bio just looks like. This is what a marine biologist looks like. Um, we're also, uh, so that spirit of, of, uh, investigation and research is very alive in what we do. The other institution is one much closer to where we are right now. And that's Hewlett Packard. Um, uh, HP founded in a garage in Palo Alto, arguably one of the, uh, by David Packard and Bill Hewlett, David Packard's daughters.

Speaker 1:          01:40          Uh, we're the ones that founded the aquarium. And so the spirit of innovation from Silicon Valley and the investigation from Stanford is really where our roots are as an institution. We've been science-based from day one and a, and we owe a lot to these two institutions. David Packard is sometimes, uh, you know, he's widely viewed as a, as a titan of silicon valley. His supervisor at Stanford, uh, Terman is, is widely referred to as the father of Silicon Valley. And Terman got his phd at Mit with Vannevar Bush, if you, that name sounds familiar. He wrote science, the endless frontier. He was the first science advisor to a US president to FDR. And so our roots, if you academics love to trace their roots back to where it started and Vannevar Bush at MIT is, you could argue is that's maybe where the aquarium started. So this is the aquarium.

Speaker 1:          02:30          This is a view off our back deck. I would say that our secret sauce is that we're about place. We're about the Monterey Bay. Um, and as you can see, maybe this wasn't taken today cause it's raining. Um, but it's a glorious place. There's a lot of amazing creatures and ecosystems just in the Monterey Bay. Um, and it's an interesting story about the history of conservation in Monterrey. It wasn't always the way it is today. Um, it's a story of fisheries collapse of immigrants coming in and bringing new technologies of the sociology of that always not being perfect, but working things out. It's a story of marine protected areas and the ecosystems actually returning and the fisheries coming back. And so it's not always been an easy story, but the story of this place I think is very important, uh, for marine conservation and the story of the ocean.

Speaker 1:          03:23          So, um, that's where we are. Um, one of the things that we're working on in the science team is to solve problems. And even though we have roots in academia and in Silicon Valley, um, we are, you know, we have, we're a modest operation. We, there's only so much that we can do. And so we want to solve a problem. Of course we're going to bring science to bear on that problem. That's what our research group help support. But we also bring policy and we also do quite a bit of communication. And so our theory of change is not necessarily, um, focusing on one of those, but doing all of those and trying to do all of them really well. We have around 2 million people that come into our physical building every year. And we have, you know, um, um, too many people and we probably have about 50 times those engagements online.

Speaker 1:          04:13          So we have an incredible ability to reach people and educate them about the ocean. A great example of this combination of science and policy and communication is the Seafood Watch. Um, it's an APP. It started as a paper card that a consumer could use to make the best choices about sustainable shellfish, aquaculture, fish or wild caught fish. And it kind of works. A, you, you can, um, if you're interested in Mahi Mahi, you can look at the variety of places that they come from, the variety of ways they're caught and choose the best, most sustainable solution. And so this is a great example. We may not be able to reach the scale of research that, that a university could do. We may not be able to do the scale of policy that a federal agency could do, and we may not have the communication reach of an organization like Google, but we tried to do all of those at the same time to solve problems.

Speaker 1:          05:05          So one, a brief example of that, Kyle mentioned Bluefin tuna. We've been working on Bluefin tuna in the Pacific, uh, for 20 years. And it's an amazing creature that, uh, we don't, that we didn't know a lot about at that time. And we learned about a Bluefin tuna, three tagging them and through tagging them by putting a living tags on them, the satellite tags that pop off and then report a lot of data to us. Uh, how deep the fish one, uh, its migratory path, it's body temperature, um, it's a celeron mitre devices on there. Um, and we tag them in the East Pacific here and we develop these practices. We innovated these techniques, these surgeries to do these tags. These fish are about 18 months to five years of age. We tag them in the West Pacific and Japan when they're of breeding age, so much larger fish, much more difficult to work with.

Speaker 1:          05:57          And we actually tag the babies at the various stages. And so the getting access to those places really helps us understand where are they going, how long they're there, and they're complete life cycle. And I mentioned that we do more than research. Our goal of course, is to recover the population. Is it over 97% depleted from its historical numbers? And just past year we had a major victory in getting all the tuna fishing nations in the Pacific Ocean to agree to recover the population. And so while science and communication and working through seafood watch and celebrity chefs, um, this is our goal. Now that we have a political agreement, we really have to focus on how we're going to rebuild it. Everyone says, yes, we want to rebuild the population. Now how do we do it? Now Science and research is going to come back to the forefront.

Speaker 1:          06:45          So this is something that I really use to guide our team. It's a quote from Ed Catmull who runs Pixar, wrote a book called Creativity Inc. I really love this because when we bring scientists in, we expect them to know science. Yes, we may bring them in, we may train them to do some things, but we're really going for art. And what I mean by that is, uh, give you an example from Hawaii. I lived in Hawaii for seven years. I worked in a variety of different capacities there, but we had a problem of only having a limited dataset of fish populations and exploitation. It only went back to about 1950 after World War II who I wasn't even a state yet. And we needed a longer term a data set in which to make decisions to know about the status of different fish populations. And we have this gap.

Speaker 1:          07:27          You can see there's a gap on the x axis between, um, we have two points in 1900 and 1902 when an economist came out and surveyed the fish markets in Hawaii. And then we didn't have any other data until 1950, 1952, something like that. So what I did is I went back and I found data, um, in restaurant menus in Waikiki restaurants and we got about 500 different restaurant menus. And on these menus, we're a, just a teeming with marine life but was fascinating is about, it wasn't always the same throughout time. The early menus had all these fish on there that were high value fish still today, but just were not being served in the restaurants and the catch had gone down. So we took a bunch of data off them and we're actually able to fill in some of the blanks over time because the menus went back before the official catch records did.

Speaker 1:          08:14          So that was really cool. And I have to tell you, uh, finding these menus, it's not like there's a Dewey decimal number for restaurant menus, so it's not like you just go to your public library. I met some people in, you know, in their garages. They're there to, to their grandma in Hawaiian. I'm gay. I would give them a box of something and then they had it in the attic or something like that. We ended up getting 500 menus, probably from a hundreds of different sources. Um, some people collected them as Curios, as souvenirs of their trip to Hawaii, a cruise from San Diego and the 1930s or something like that. I cut him off Ebay. I got them off craigslist. Uh, all sorts of places. I met a lot of great people and heard a lot of great stories, but the reason I'm showing you this because of it's because of this plot in the lower rate, the green plot, those are the data, but this is my inspiration for them.

Speaker 1:          09:03          I'm sort of quoting the Nepali coast, if that makes sense. If anyone's been to the island of Kawaii, it hasn't astounding coastline. That's what that was. I guess you could say it was sort of made famous in the movie Jurassic Park when the helicopter comes in. Um, but this, these are the data here, but we're trying to be artful about it and we're quoting recycling. This is a paper about Hawaii. Let's show Hawaii somehow. So the Nepali coast is kind of embedded in this. Another thing that we've been looking at is modeling the risk to coral reefs and the fisheries in the, in those reefs. Sort of like the fisheries fallout from the collapse of reefs. If you want to think about it like that. And we're trying to think about all sorts of ways to visualize the data. And there is a map and here's the sort of major ecosystems, the top 29 ecosystems where reefs are and we're ranking them and trying to prioritize where risk lies the most.

Speaker 1:          09:54          Um, but if you perhaps are familiar with this band from the early eighties were quoting this album, cover a joy division. Um, and uh, there's actually a package within the, the software application are that you can use. It's called joy plot. And we're just quoting this joy division because they're kind of a cool band and it's actually a good way to visualize the data, but there's all sorts of ways to be artful about how you discuss the story of the data and how you visualize it. And so that's one of the things we're trying to do. A big thing for us is how do we observe and analyze data autonomously. Um, you guys are probably in a similar business, I would imagine. Um, this sort of story begins with Rachel Carson's book and the 1960 [inaudible] silent spring. And I think one of the things we really learned from that is that there's no such thing as a way what we say.

Speaker 1:          10:46          There's no such thing as a way. Um, and if you're thinking about sustainability, you're thinking about, um, closing the loop, having a circular economy, um, waste equals food. You've probably heard of before. One of my professors used to say, and this consciousness is really came because of Rachel spring. If you throw something in a river, it doesn't go away. The river takes it to some other place, right? And so we're thinking about this in the North Pacific in terms of microplastic pollution, it's become, you've probably heard about plastic in the ocean. It breaks down to very small, bit smaller than a millimeter, then it's microplastic. And then it gets into the food web and it has toxins in the material of the plastic. It absorbs toxins from the water column. So on the surface, and then it gets into the food web. You've probably heard about these, a great Pacific garbage patches, these gyres, which sort of physically concentrate the plastic.

Speaker 1:          11:40          And one of the things that that were really fascinated by is those are not areas of high biological importance. We sometimes refer to them as biological deserts. Actually, there's area immediately to the south of this gyre on the right and between California and Hawaii where we've seen a lot of great white sharks congregate. It's called the White Shark cafe. And we sort of refer to that as like the burning man for white sharks because they're going out to, a lot of the males are going out to the desert. We don't know if it's for to meet someone special or if it's to get a bite to eat or to have a, uh, an a, an experience. Um, but, um, this garbage patch, um, I, I've, I've not been to the garbage patch, but on the very periphery of it is the big island of Hawaii and one of the beaches they're called Camilo beach is very famous for its sand, essentially being plastic because it's buffering right on the edge of that gyre.

Speaker 1:          12:37          And it just sort of scrubs like friction, the plastic out of the water as it hits the edge of that beach, and I worked on sea turtles a lot in Hawaii. This little hawksbill turtle is probably four months old. It would fit in the palm of your hand about nine centimeters long was at shell and it had 41 pieces of plastic in his gastrointestinal track. It didn't make it, and so there's, this is a problem with animals ingesting it. It's an acute challenge, but there's also this longer term challenge and we don't know the implications. Like I said, there's a lot of plastic in those gyres, but the area up top where it goes from cool green to sort of warmer yellow and red is this thermocline that we know is a biodiversity hotspot. It's a path along which whales and turtles and large fish like Bluefin tuna and swordfish travel, and it's where a lot of fisheries congregate.

Speaker 1:          13:28          Now how do we get out there and measure plastic at the scale of thousands kilometers? If we're going to do that, it's going to be a drone. We can't afford to send big hundreds of longs foot ships out there that costs tens of thousands of dollars a day. It's much more feasible to send a drone. So we're going to work with them. Bari, the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute, that's kind of like, it's kind of like your younger sibling that gets all the cool toys. That's kind of how embar he is for us. And they have an exceptional talent of creating sensors and putting them on vehicles to go observe the places in the ocean at scale and inaccessible places like the deep, which is one of the things they focused on. And so we're developing technology to monitor that transition zone, that area of biological importance in the North Pacific to really survey it for plastics because we think that what's going on with plastic in that place is a lot more important than what's going on in the desert by comparison because that's an ecosystem biodiversity hotspot.

Speaker 1:          14:32          So not only observing the data, but interpreting and analyzing the data needs to be autonomous. We're using this is, you're not meant, you're not supposed to see all these individual plots. There's 268 a spectra from microplastic. Every little piece of plastic that we have pulled out of the ocean, we have to read with a, um, to read their spectrum to determine what it is. And we cannot do that manually. So we're using machine learning algorithms and neural networks to process these and identify them at scale. If we were to do this in the ocean at the scale of the problem, we need to have, we need to match the scale of observation and the scale of analysis to the scale of the problem. And that's an ocean. So we're using autonomous observation drones and we're using autonomous analysis and machine learning. But what I really want to talk about is this.

Speaker 1:          15:25          Um, you all are familiar with search searches, everything, but you can't do search if you don't have memory. And so if you don't have memory, you have nothing. What we're trying to do, uh, we just opened a new lab in our conservation, a research group, and it's called the ocean memory lab. And the idea behind this lab is that we are trying to build longterm records, a ecological records of the ocean so we can have proper baselines for ecosystem health if we don't have that memory of what a healthy ocean is, not just the last 10 years, not the last 40 years, way beyond my lifetime, hundreds of years. How do we build that record? Because that record is absolutely integral for understanding where we are, where we need to get back to, and then perhaps in paths on how to get there. So this is an important, an incredibly important plot is this carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere as measured from the Mount of Loa observatory on the Big Island of Hawaii.

Speaker 1:          16:26          And so this is just what I want to show you is this magic red line. Let's think of that as a baseline. 400 parts per million of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is aligned that we had kind of set several years ago is something we never wanted to cross. What we've crossed it. We crossed it and a 2015, I think for the first time and you can see there's a seasonal cycle, sort of the air, the planet breathing rather. And um, it goes up and down with the northern hemisphere forest in the winter being deciduous and losing their leaves and the ocean cycle. Now as I go back and as I add more data to that, you can see how far apart the historical observation is from that red line that we didn't want to cross in 400. We go back to 1950. You go back to 1900, we'd go back to 1800 and we can even go back further now.

Speaker 1:          17:16          How do you think that this graph was built? You can see there's sort of three different sections of the graph. Well, the first part, we can go back even further. Um, the first part is done with an instrument measuring it beginning in 1958. You know, when you've made a good scientific figure, when they in bronze it and put it on the side of a building, right? It should be like every scientist goal that they'll end bronze. I figure that I've made and maybe my restaurant menus when we'll get there someday, but, but, um, but, but not today. So, um, keeling from Scripps Institute of Oceanography started these measurements in 1958 and then when they said, you know, you're onto something here, but we need more data. We wish you had done that in 1758. But of course we didn't have sensors, so how do you think they went back and build it?

Speaker 1:          17:59          They went through glacial ice cores and went to Antarctica and dozens of teams from all over the world of international collaborators have worked to build this together. But this plot is called the keeling curve, right? And this is the absolute important baseline for us to measure climate change and where we are today. This is what began at all really. And we don't have one of these for plastic. We don't have one of these for a lot of problems. So how do we build this memory? Well, let's go back to this idea of drones. There is a drone inside. There's a payload with uh, data and observation scheme, some sore sensors, uh, some sort of propulsion, there is energy, there's battery of some sort. And then probably some sort of way to transmit the data back to moss landing to Ambari. Well, what I would go out to embargo, I say I've been working with drones my entire professional life, but I've never touched one of those things.

Speaker 1:          18:58          I have touched one of these things. This is a sea turtle shell. And what my, uh, my ideas that actually animals are drones. They are, they have long, they have tissues that they take data on their ecosystem experience and are recording it and our learning all sorts of stuff about the conditions of the ocean. So let me explain that a bit more. That's a hawksbill sea turtle right there. Uh, this turtle, uh, uh, died many years ago and it was in a freezer in Hawaii when I got there. And then we did a necropsy on it. It had been in a freezer since 1992 and I said, well, let's learn something about this animal that met a bad end and maybe we can get some information about how to manage the population better. So this animal, obviously a beautiful show was not hunted historically for it's, it's a neat, it was used for its show and you can see why it's gorgeous and, but the thing is within that and within that Shell, my idea was that there's probably a lot of data.

Speaker 1:          19:58          So to first we need a, we need some sort of baseline record of time. And so this is one way we go about doing this. This is obviously a nuclear test in, uh, probably several kilometers away from where that animal actually died that I just showed you. And this is in the Marshall Islands. Um, you can see, um, that this is injecting all sorts of heavy carbon into the atmosphere, radiocarbon or 14 carbon. And what we can do is we can get a map of the memory of that radioactive carbon in the system through corals. And we did this in Hawaii. And you can just see the levels of radiocarbon are pretty much low background baseline until about 1950 and then they start to uptick. They peak in the late sixties early seventies depending on where you are on the planet and then they start to decline with a nuclear test ban treaty, right?

Speaker 1:          20:50          But this right here is a, is a very helpful, a calendar of radiocarbon that we can use to understand the timing of these different animals in the ocean. Some of the most basic things about wildlife, like a Bluefin tuna or a blue whale or even a sea turtle is how old is it? How long is it going to live? Where did it come from, where was it born, where is it going to breed? These basic questions are really elusive. This is a cross section of one of those shells that I showed you earlier. We know this animal died in 1976 but we can micro sample along the various gradients, kind of like the grains on a log of wood, right? But one line isn't necessarily one year. And so what we do is we use tools much like what your dentist will use to fix a cavity, a very small, precise drill.

Speaker 1:          21:41          And we drill out powder from there and we analyze the isotopes. And using the radio, carbon isotopes or bomb radiocarbon, we can actually go back and date each one of those sections and say, oh, this animal was born in 1953 at dot. In 1976 it was 23 years old. Um, now we can say, oh, this isn't just a sea turtle shell. It's a clock, but it's also a passport. It's also a recording toxins and it's also recording temperature. There are literally dozens of things we can get out of that Shell to understand the experience of that individual turtle that we can build a record of its environment. So let me give you a another example. But before I do that, I want to explain to you marine food webs in a very sort of cartoony basic kind of way. Um, at the very basic level we have the sun, which is it's trophic position or trophic level is zero.

Speaker 1:          22:38          Something that eats only the sun is trophic position of one like phytoplankton. Something that only eats phytoplankton is going to be to something that only eats that like a small, like a sardine or something is going to be three. A tuna that eats that is going to be four and then something that eats that is going to be five so there are these changes that you when you go up the food web. Now, one of the things that people have looked over time is to measure the aggregate performance of a fishery. By getting its mean trophic levels, so you look at all the fish that were caught, you assign a trophic level to each one, you weight it by the mass, and then you just scale up. Now if you look at over time in different parts of the ocean, this is the northwest Atlantic, the northeast Atlantic, the southeast Pacific, and then the Mediterranean.

Speaker 1:          23:22          You can see as catchin fish goes up, the trophic position goes down. That means those food webs are, those chains are getting smaller. That's something we want to avoid because that means the systems are getting simpler, less complex, less resilient, and they're losing some of the top predators. Now this has been a subject of a lot of debates gone back and forth because when you use fisheries data to measure the performance of a fishery, there are inherent biases. Um, what you can see in this plot and the lower left is the importance of anchovy. When the anchovy catch goes up, the trophic position of the aggregate fishery goes way down because it's a low foraging fish, right? And so there's been a lot of debate about this. Well, one of the things we said is trophic level, kind of an interesting idea, but maybe if we don't use fisheries data to measure it, maybe if we use, because it has inherent economic biases.

Speaker 1:          24:14          What if people decide they don't want to use anchovies anymore? They want to use natural fertilizer instead of fish fertilizer. What if there is a moratorium and the u s on a certain kind of fishery that'll change the catch. So the ecosystem isn't changing. It's just the economic rules are changing, right? So we actually want to measure what we're interested in measuring without artifacts. It's a huge issue in an observation and measurement, right? So we said, why don't we look at these birds because they're also interested in eating fish and they're like us. They're searching the ocean for top predatorial fish. Um, but they're not subject to economic constraints like we are. And one of the things about those cool drones that embargo it and other people make is they're fascinating, but they can't go back in time. They're not time machines. But working with museums and repositories, we can actually go back in time.

Speaker 1:          25:03          And that study I just showed you those kind of weighing things, they're based on fisheries statistics, which are largely after World War Two. So you're limited to dated back to 1950 of course, the ocean was changing before 1950 of course we were fishing before 1950 of course, climate change was happening before 1950 so let's go back before 1950 but in order to do that, we have to be creative. And so we started going to museums and getting seabirds. These birds are from the late 18 hundreds and we can measure throughout time there trophic position by looking at the ratio of amino acids in their feathers. So these birds have thousands of feathers. These are precious specimens. We don't want to harm the, but we can just go in and take two feathers. You'd net the bird never knows we, we came in left, right? And even an expert would not even know that we took those feathers.

Speaker 1:          25:50          We take body feathers, we don't take the beautiful long primary flight feathers that like the kinds you're used to like dipping in an ink bottle and write writing with. Now these are like the downy feathers in the breast. We take two of these, there's another 900, there's another 9,000 they're waiting left. And um, but importantly, these resources are already there. National history repositories, museum's collections. There are, these are all over the world and they're literally just data archives sitting in a drawer, right? And so we're trying to tap some of the potential of these to understand longterm trends in the ocean. We went and use this technique called compound specific stable isotope analysis in amino acids kind of rolls off the tongue, but what we can do is similar to the heavy carbon theory, this does not a radioisotope this, this is a stable isotope, but we can look at where they are in the food level based on the nitrogen that they're accruing to heavy nitrogen.

Speaker 1:          26:44          And what we found in looking at eight different species is that you can see in the lower left that pink plot is an ensemble of all those pieces of birds there. Trophic position is declining and it's almost exactly the same magnitude of decline as was measured in the fisheries data. But what's really cool about this is because they're birds and people are fascinated by birds, and I'm studied for birds for a long time, is we actually know the Diet of these birds because those, that dot on there with a huge error bars is one point in time where some of my colleagues in Hawaii actually captured a lot of these birds and looked at their stomach contents and basically got the stomach contents of hundreds of seabirds, which you can imagine what that experience was like. Um, it was, it was a little pungent, I would say.

Speaker 1:          27:31          Um, but nonetheless, they reconstructed the diets of all these animals and we can then we have two sources of data. Now we have diet contents, which are pretty primary source, and then we reconstructed it from the amino acids in their feathers beginning in 1890 and then sequentially over time to today. Now what we can do is we have the trophic levels and we have a diets we can actually solve for x and we can actually look at their diets. Over time. We can reconstruct what the diets would have been to produce those trophic levels. And what we can see if you look in the lower left, the ensemble for the all species is that squid populations in the North Pacific have doubled in the last hundred and 30 years. So that's just describing what's happening right through the feathers. This is a, an albatross a and Albatross of course.

Speaker 1:          28:20          It's an uh, very well known for its ability to fly very efficiently over long areas in search La, huge areas of the ocean with very little energy expended. You may not know this, but its wing is the archetype for the Mars plane that's being designed right now by NASA. This plane has no, propulsion is just a glider. They're going to drop it in the outer atmosphere of Mars and it's just going to descend hopefully at a very slow rate. They're hoping for three minutes because the atmosphere has never been measured in Mars. They have a rover but they don't have a plane. But the design of his wing has called a Prendall weeing and it's designed basically off the same principles as an albatross wing. So it's a pretty good flyer that's on how to say. Um, but now that we have, we can say the trophic positions have changed over time.

Speaker 1:          29:05          The fish that they're eating has changed over time. Why is that happening? Well, here it comes to machine learning again, we can take various measurements of eco morphology. We take various measurements of the climate data in the North Pacific and we take various ways a data streams, a fisheries, and we can say all these things could be affecting why these birds and they're trophic position is declining. It could be the birds themselves. Some of them are really great flyers like Albatross. Some of them are a little chunkier and have shorter wings and can't fly as far. Um, then we have all these things going on with climate. We have all these things going on with fisheries. So what's causing it. And so we can run and apply machine learning, random forest algorithms and build models to understand this, that the human eye or some more standard statistical methods like general linearized models can't do.

Speaker 1:          29:52          And we can say that from all of this. I will tell you that all of those things matter because these animals don't get driven by one variable. They get driven by many variables because the ocean is a multidisciplinary space. So if you're an albatross, you can fly further. But climate change is also happening. And commercial fisheries are also taking your preferred fish out of the ocean. And so we can do all of those things. But the important point that I'm trying to say here is that we started with feathers. We started with birds in a drawer that weren't being used for anything. And we were able to build this whole story about how the ocean is changing and how squid populations are growing just from looking at amino acids in bird feathers. So let me give you another example. Back to home again, the Monterey Bay. I mentioned that we have our roots in the, uh, Stanford, uh, marine lab, which is right next door.

Speaker 1:          30:45          Hopkins Marine Lab. They've been there at that location for a hundred years. And they have been every morning since the early 19 hundreds have been the docent in charge, uh, go out and ADM dip a bucket of water into the ocean, put a thermometer in it and measure the temperature. Now they did that every day of the week except Sunday for about 10 years. And then they were like, well, to hell with that was with the Sunday too. And uh, so we have this really cool data record, but we had, this is going back to instruments versus proxies, right? About 1919. We have those data records on the temperature of the ocean every morning at ADM. So from those data, we can learn a few things. We can look at the average temperature, but often what's really important is the extremes. So if I just look at that time series of thermometer in a bucket, ADM from our colleagues next door, we can see that the hottest week of the year has changed and has become two degrees c hotter today than it was when they first started in 1919.

Speaker 1:          31:47          Okay. So think about that. May Say, well to seat isn't terrible, maybe it's not great. Um, but then if you look at another way of measuring it, if we look at when that hot week is not just how hot is that week, the extreme, the, you know, the 50 the first hottest week of the year, but not just how hot does it, but when does it occur and it occurs about 10 days earlier. So that's not only happening, it's a higher magnitude of heat, but it's actually occurring earlier in the year. Not a huge surprise I those things. But then if you actually say, let's not look at weeks, let's look at days and let's look at extreme heat days. This is where it really gets interesting. And we see there are now 68 more extreme heat days than there were a hundred years ago. This is just one century in one place. And this is the value of data we wouldn't be able to have.

Speaker 1:          32:37          We'll be able to search these records and come up with these statistics are how these metrics, if we didn't have the memory right, but we can actually go back further than when they were measuring with a thermometer with um, with a human actually going out there with the sensor. And that's actually with macro algae. People have been collecting algae probably as long as people have been going into the ocean. It's really easy to do. Um, it basically, uh, the procedure goes like this. You reach down, you pick up the algae and you put in your pocket. You know, it's a little bit more complex. Usually you press it between two pieces of paper. But we have an herbarium at the aquarium called the herbarium aquarium or Barium. And we've been collecting since the late seventies when we started scoping out what we were going to win. The aquarium started getting designed and build.

Speaker 1:          33:26          But our neighbors next door have been collecting algae since the 1890s and even before a little bit. So this is the same, uh, jenness of red algae callow Phyllis. And you can see that even though it's been kept between two pieces of paper for 100 and uh, almost 30 years, it looks spread. It still looks the same and it's in remarkably good condition. So what we can do is we can actually recreate the temperature of the ocean in which that Alga specimen lived. By looking at the oxygen isotopes, we can look at the nutrients in that ocean. We can look at the pollution in that ocean. We can look at, this is a, this is an organism that roots in the bottom. So it didn't migrate. So we can't say, oh, what's it's passport? Did it go to Japan and come back? It did not do that.

Speaker 1:          34:15          We can say that right now with no one sees. But this is really important. And so what we're now doing is trying to say, well, these are all our specimens over time. We didn't collect it equal amounts, but we can go back and use these algae or we can use birds are, we can use tuna, we can use auditors, we can use sharks to really learn a ton about the ocean. And we just need to sort of go into the memory, find the platform, find the drone, whatever animal or plant that is, get the sensor out of it and then recreate that. Thank you very much.

Speaker 2:          34:49          [inaudible] if

Speaker 1:          34:53          you could prioritize, I'm sort of interventions, do you have anything you would call out? What sort of interventions or to like to improve? Like if we're going on this downward trend, um, in a lot of ways, do you have suggestions of focus areas, you know, for all of us as consumers are, you know, I think one of the, uh, before we get there, I think the, um, it's an important question and it's, it's the obvious question I think. Uh, how do you prioritize what problems to address and then cause you can't do everything, but let's just say it's difficult to do everything. Um, I would say that one of the issues that's been really fascinating as a scientist and a conservationist to observe is the public engagement on the issue of microplastic. We were not really concerned and talking about that 10 years ago, that is not a new issue.

Speaker 1:          35:46          It's been identified for a while. It just really seems to have captured the environmental consciousness and even the public consciousness is what do we, the garbage patch. And I think the way that we think about that is now that we know, let's do something about it. Right? That's why Sylvia Earle and others would say something like that. I think that's a, that's a really good way. Now that we have the information, now that we have the data, what are we gonna what are we gonna do about it? I think when it comes to plastic, the easiest thing to do is to not use single use plastic, a throwaway or recyclable water bottle that basically has a one use lifetime and then it gets repurposed to something else. Um, and so what I would say is that's the easiest thing to address, but it's pervasive. You see single use plastic and a lot of different places.

Speaker 1:          36:34          Um, and I think that would be something that you can immediately do. I think the choices that we make when it comes to climate change, which probably, um, the, the, one of the things that I've heard in these are very difficult things to measure. But if we were to stop looking at the issue of climate change versus issue a plastic, what's more important? Um, if we were to stop, if we had a magic button that we could turn off all carbon emissions, we could go carbon neutral today. We would still be dealing with the problem of climate change 1000 years from now because the earth's climate system is so complex and the ocean is a huge reservoir of heat that it takes a long time for things to equilibrate. One of the reasons that perhaps climate change isn't as severe today as it we might think it would be is because the ocean is holding so much of the heat.

Speaker 1:          37:23          And so it's like this buffer that's controlling, um, our climate system. So a thousand years for climate. If we were to do the same kind of thing and magically turn off our plastic and microplastic pollution switch, we would probably be dealing with this for another 40 years. Very different magnitude of the problem. So climate is probably something that is going to affect everyone and has been for decades. And I would say the choice, the choices that we make in terms of our carbon emissions and our carbon consumption are massive. The food that you eat, the travel that you do, the people tuning in from other places that didn't fly here, that actually are just tuning in online. Great Choice. Um, and I think we just need to prioritize those decisions. We're even looking at this in our research programs. We have three different research projects that we could do and we're evaluating right now. Well, how does sustainability factor into this? These are all three very, this is the, it's a, we have a great, we have a great problem. We have three fascinating research programs. What, um, one project on acts one project on why one project on Z, but they're not all the same in terms of their carbon consumption. Some of them would be maybe require more energy and that's into our consciousness right now about how we prioritize and choose projects for just for research.

Speaker 3:          38:39          Is there any policy compliant you would add to the plastic space, you know, in terms of an intervention you wish.

Speaker 1:          38:48          So I'm a scientist and we have a lot of policy experts that we work with, but I would say that uh, policies addressing single use plastic plastic is so pervasive in our society. I'm probably am holding plastic in my hand right now. Um, but I'm not going to recycle it or throw it away. I'm going to use it for a very long time. And I would say that, uh, policies relating to single use plastic are just things that we need to incentivize that going away. First of all, thank you so much for coming. That took was amazing. I think we all agree. Uh, one question I was wondering about is, um, so you talked about this memory lab that your guys aren't building is, but you also talked about the creative ways that you use together all the data that is, you know, hidden everywhere and very difficult to find.

Speaker 1:          39:33          So it was just wondering is the goal to open up their lab to everyone? And I don't know if I have feathers in my room from 10 years ago. Like, are you going to encourage people to participate and, um, put the data that they might have at the disposal of the aquarium and also, uh, are you going to make the data available to other scientists and Greg, uh, other people? That's a great question. So the first thing is, I want to say is I've had written above my desk for a long time. More data is more better, right? Even though the grammar isn't great, the people get what I mean by that. Um, so, uh, when I was doing the menu's project in Hawaii, we, there's this thing in Hawaii, you may not have heard of it called coconut wireless. It's the word getting out.

Speaker 1:          40:18          You know, um, it's a, it's a, it's a joke of course is the gossip train. And, uh, when I was working on this project, coconut wireless who is in full effect and I would get people, um, and then when we published the study and it was on NPR, I got a lot of random solicitations. People just sent me stuff in the mail. But I would get calls and saying, Hey, I have five menus from 1960. Do you want them? And I'm like, yes, of course I do. So, um, when it comes to wildlife, it's a little trick here because do you tend to any permits? So we wouldn't say, hey, here's a, here's an open data call for sea bird feathers because we want the, the pros to do that, um, and permitted fashion. But I would say that, um, yes, there will be, we are going to be increasingly communicating, uh, with the general public about ways they can get involved and contribute data to our, to our projects.

Speaker 1:          41:08          And as we do that, I think that's an incredible point cause crowdsourcing and involving citizens science is a, is a very big component of where we're going. On the second question about open, open access, open source. Um, we're a nonprofit and it's, it's one of our core values to be open access and open source Ambari. Um, they make some amazing devices and then they put the blueprints online. It's really amazing that they, that um, because they're the same, they're, they had the same DNA as we do. Uh, we want to be open access. So we use open science framework, we use get hub, we use fixed share research gate. We put all of our publications online. We're increasingly trying to work with only open access journals because we want to work with people all over the world who may not have access to a university library in which those things are free and openly available.

Speaker 1:          41:58          So we, it's a huge value of ours to make our data accessible, to invite people into our research projects in a way that they can meaningfully contribute. I mean, be a coauthor in our work. Um, we want to solve problems and we know we need more data and more experts. We firmly believe in the theory of plenty at the more eyes and the more minds you have in a project, the more comes out of it. It's not like we have to Gollum it. Um, so we can get all the glory. That's not our position at all. We want to, um, open science, open access is, is where we are. So yes, and we're, we're building the data infrastructure to make that seamlessly happen. And then the user interface, it's very intuitive. I think some of the problems that were actually, I'll go even a step further.

Speaker 1:          42:40          Some of the problems that we're dealing with, everyone in this room may be in the choir and maybe like super onboard, but there, let's be honest, there are some more difficult issues that aren't so obvious and have to get people with disparate beliefs and political persuasions to agree on. So one of the things that we're doing when we publish a paper or now a publishing, uh, transparent gooeys uh, graphical user interfaces to let people say, well we did the study this way, but if you pull the dials in different ways you can get a different answer. So some of the problems we're solving, we're trying to actually recruit, do it a different way and I think that's where science is going to be going with much more interactive where the, the analytical framework is on the backend and you just have a user interface and you're using machine learning, you're just pushing little dials with your mouse and that's where we're going to be going through things like um, um, the frameworks usually on the ar platform where we can do this.

Speaker 4:          43:37          Yeah. What you were just referring to with how you're building your research now so that it can be more presentable to people with other views. Is that how you're making it more open to things like, um, getting fisheries onboard for things like cds with Bluefin and things like that? Cause I know in the past it's been a challenge to get the fisheries and other people, lobbyists, stuff like that on board with getting protected fisheries, all of that, all of that fun stuff integrated. Um, just the challenge of having an species protected and sure, scientists working together with all of that, you can put it more eloquently. I'll let you do that. So that's the main question. Is there a way to get science working together with people who wish to deny science or use it in a way,

Speaker 1:          44:32          um, that supports fisheries versus science? Sure. It's a great question. I would say that, um, oh, what I would say is that a lot of people care about Bluefin tuna for different reasons. And um, I think everyone pretty much cares about bluefin tuna, h just for different incentives and their incentives are prioritized differently. If you're a Bluefin tuna fishermen, you can't fish for blue's name if there are no bluefin. So, um, it's, it's in everyone's interest for there to be Bluefin tuna. It's just how much are extracted every year. But I think that what you're getting at is exactly the point is that when we do analyses and we come to conclusion, we not only want to be transparent about the data, about how he got there, but then we say, and here, here's the interactive where you can choose your own incentives. Think about a situation like, um, um, choosing where to put a marine protected area and preserve in the ocean.

Speaker 1:          45:27          Um, if your incentives are to protect climate change or to rebuild fisheries or to have a variety of other things, those places could show up differently in the ocean to protect biodiversity. Um, and what we can do is we can say, here are the 10 most, uh, that the top 10 market share of ideas for ocean conservation, for marine protected areas. We can build those data layers there, exists now and we could say, and you can weight them however you want this one 10, this one, zero, this one five. And then it gives you a map. That's what we're working on right now. It was kinds of interactive

Speaker 5:          46:04          with the success at places like problem Fomo is easier to prove that it's capable to bring back the species and biodiversity easier to show the fisheries and official manner that it is possible to bring it back. It's been wiped out such

Speaker 1:          46:24          a manner. So there you mentioned Cabo Pomo, there's some great success stories of conservation working. I would just look at the great whales in the Pacific Ocean blue whale, humpback whale gray whale. These are basically candidates for removing from the endangered species list now, um, because their populations have been growing at three to 6% a year, um, ever since they put a moratorium on whaling. And so, uh, what's amazing is if you don't kill whales, they actually do well. And I think that's something everyone agrees on one. Um, and so there was a lot of examples like that. And so it's just how do you get protection? How do you get to, how do you serve the dual mandate of commercial fisheries and conservation? That's the question. And how much do you weigh in which one? And I think when you move towards it, a data rich, open, relatable, interactive framework, a lot of the, a lot of the disagreements can be a back beat, can be about, we don't trust your data, we don't trust your methods and, and you're doing it behind closed doors and not inviting us to be a part of it.

Speaker 1:          47:30          Well, all of those disagreements go away when you make the data available. When you make the processes transparent and rational and when you make their interactives online, that really anyone can, can very intuitively understand. And that's what I think is we're trying to meet everyone where that, cause all of those complaints are totally valid. We don't want secret data. We don't want to secret methods. We don't have any secret rooms with secret decisions when it all to be out there. The whole point of science is that it's, it's a Galitary and a democratic and accessible. Um, and so we need to have the infrastructures and the platforms to make it that way.

Speaker 6:          48:05          So when you were talking about the keeling curve measuring the co two levels and uh, that at 1958 and onwards I think, uh, we have an instrument that I guess is very, very good at this and before it's more of a proxy, how do you align the data from the two and possibly even maybe many disparate historical sources. How do you make sure that they are calibrated or that sort of thing for something like this with the ocean when we left, hmm.

Speaker 1:          48:31          I think it's like a symphony. You have a bunch of different instruments and you're trying to make a coherent narrative out of it. And uh, when it comes to, I'm less of an expert on the COO two series and it, that is a, is a lot of research groups from a lot of countries and a lot of NSF funding and a lot of major programs that went into building that curve. It May, you may look at that curve and say, oh, it's just a simple graph and it's so much work went into that graph. Sometimes when you look at the figures and we can just scrape data, put a cool vis together in like an hour, and then you look at something like that. And that is like PhDs and careers in a wards in the huge amount of effort went into that. But getting, getting together a proxy and a calibrated Dataset is usually the beginning of a lot of the thought of some of our projects is we start with some sort of training set and then we start with something that we think is a good proxy and how do we add those two together so that we can take the training set away and then we can do it at scale.

Speaker 1:          49:31          This is what we're doing with microplastic. When we look at the Ramond laser spectroscopy, we trained the spectra on known types and then we go out and we do the proxies. The problem is is that plastic in the ocean is been tumbled around in the waves are at depth, extreme temperatures, different acidities in an animal's stomach for a while. So it's a lot not pristine. So we, but that's actually part of the magic because we can actually now using spectroscopy, we're working to age some of these particles. We can say not only is it nylon, but it's nylon has been in the ocean for 40 years. That's really helpful information as opposed to saying, well 40% of it's not on 40% of its polycarbon and in 40% of its polyamide or has more than a hundred percent but um, but you, you get the idea. But I think just having those training sets, when you go back in time, the error bars can get a little broader.

Speaker 1:          50:24          And so it's just, the question is just realizing the limits of your data and using a training set that is unassailable. I say that's our general approach going about it. Some proxies are, are more difficult than others and sometimes it's a proxy of, it's like a metro, she Goodall of data and then you get that little thing on the inside. Right. And we want to have, we wanted to kind of limit our proxies, but it's amazing what you can do if you have some data to begin with. As opposed to nothing. Thank you very much.
