Speaker 1:          00:06          I'd like to introduce our guests this morning, who is, um, coming to talk to us about mission to Mars. Um, Laura Parkinson Lark. I'm a former Googler. Welcome back.

Speaker 2:          00:17          [inaudible] all right,

Speaker 1:          00:32          well, hello. Uh, many of you may remember me as the Bora Parkinson though I am now Laurel Arc. So I was actually a Googler for about five years. Um, I worked on them up at team and in Corner Stan until I left last January to go to go to Mars, but not really Mars. We'll get there, uh, to join high seas mission five as the mission specialist in it and media. Slash outreach. Um, my crew mates had shorter titles.

Speaker 1:          01:04          So let's talk about Mars. Mars is really far away, so if at their farthest, if Mars were at the back of the room, the moon is somewhere around the middle of my nostril. Sorry if my face is the earth important premise and Martha at the back of the room, the moon would be somewhere around the middle of my nostril and the ISS is probably so close to my skin. You couldn't fit a hair between it and me. Um, so it's much, much farther than we've sent humans before. Uh, so this carries a couple, um, a couple of implications. So teams on Mars would have to be much more autonomous then teams on the ISS or even on the moon. You know, you can't have teams of people sitting in mission control watching their every move and telling them what to do. They're going to be operating on their own.

Speaker 1:          01:54          They're going to be much less in control of mission control. Um, so it also means that if you send a team there and they don't get along or they're not effective for some reason, that's really expensive because it's so expensive to send them there in the first place. Um, so, uh, NASA has identified some gaps including, uh, gaps in what we know about how to send people to Mars, including some to do with team cohesion and to help fill these gaps. Uh, NASA funds high seas. So high seas is basically a psychological study. They're looking at team cohesion and team selection for a long duration space missions. Um, so to do this, they run simulated long duration Mars missions. Uh, they've got a habitat, they select crews and put them in the habitat and collect a bunch of data and see what happens. So there have been five crew so far.

Speaker 1:          02:54          Our cruise two through four were they focused on crew cohesion, um, for crews five and six. Um, so I was proof five, uh, crew six goes into the Hab, I think in February. Um, they're focusing on crew cohesion still and also crew selection. Uh, and so their goal is to figure out how to choose and support teams so that they'll be cohesive and highly performing in Mars like conditions. Um, so when we talk about Margiela conditions, uh, usually what people talk about is isolated, confined an extreme. So that's the acronym you see ice. Uh, so the conditions at high seas are isolated and confined. They're not extreme because, um, last I checked, it's not legal to put human research subjects in mortal danger. Um, but the information gained from high C's can be combined with information from the ISS or cruise in the Antarctic bases, um, or even a missions in Nimmo.

Speaker 1:          03:55          The underground, the underwater laboratory to get a holistic picture of how to send teams to Mars. So let's talk about the hat. Um, so this is a picture of the High Seas Habitat. Um, so it's on model Loa, volcano in Hawaii. As you can see, it's quite a visually and physically isolated. It's pretty far off the main road that is not traveled very much. I'm way up in the middle of these lava fields, so not a lot of green visible. Um, it's a 8,200 feet elevation, about 10 miles from the Caldera of Maunaloa. Um, did not prove to be a problem for us. Um, and it's also chosen for its geological similarity to Mars. So actually the Johnson's space center, Mars regolith Simulant Aka fake Mars dirt is mind about 20 miles from here.

Speaker 1:          04:56          So, uh, the, the habits self, it has about 1200 square feet of space, a thousand feet usable. And it consists of this dome here and unattached storage container. Uh, they're connected by a little tunnel sort of thing. And, um, it's all our living space. We've also got our solar panels that we get our energy from. Our water tanks are, you can see our waste water tanks, slush, evaporation field. Uh, so this is the setup of the hab inside. We've got basically one big area for living, working, eating meetings. Uh, everything we need to do exercise, uh, half the desk each. And then upstairs we've each got a private room. Um, studies show that privacy is important psychologically. Um, so this is my room so you can see about enough space for a desk and a bed. Um, basically everybody gets a wedge of the Pie in the upstairs.

Speaker 2:          06:07          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          06:07          And of course because we are

Speaker 2:          06:11          okay

Speaker 1:          06:11          on Mars, you have to suit up to leave and I'll get to that later.

Speaker 2:          06:17          Okay.

Speaker 1:          06:18          Um, so the crew, we're the lucky ones who got to go, but there's a whole system of people supporting the mission. Um, and in a way, this is part of what's being studied because the current, the current paradigm of Mission Control and a crew that is in close contact all the time and I'm very much controlled by mission control, isn't going to work when you're as far away as crews will be. So, uh, we have a team of people there to assist us called mission support. Um, it's about 30 volunteers from around the world. They take shifts. Uh, we've got a first tier support that's there to answer questions, get us information, help us solve problems, um, for 12 hours a day, and then someone on 24 hours a day in case we have a real emergency. Um, so we also have our, uh, technical and engineering support.

Speaker 1:          07:13          These are the people who set up the network, uh, who actually built the Hab and can help us. Um, for example, uh, at one point our water tanks weren't leveling and it turned out to be an undocumented one way valve. So they help us with this sort of issue. We also have a geologist on staff who helps us both with our assigned field work as part of the simulation. Um, and just with questions that we have about the area around the hub, of course there's um, mission management to uh, actually makes sure things run, gets us water deliveries, the sort of thing and the primary researchers. So there are many studies going on during each mission. I'm on us and there's a team of researchers conducting these, uh, and then, uh, sort of external partners. So both, uh, media like you can see here a couple of people from the New York Times as well as, um, our project manager and local mission support person, uh, and various external researchers who some of the crew worked with. Um, and I will say with this sort of thing, it's very important to have some local mission support. Um, since practically we, we are a bunch of people living on earth, not on Mars and need people to do things like drive up food every so often and take away garbage and be there in case one of us needs to be driven to the doctor. In a nonemergency way or something.

Speaker 1:          08:47          So let's see here. You can see a couple of our engineers are engineers and the crew inside the hub.

Speaker 1:          08:58          So a major aspect of the mission and of the isolation was our communications set up. Um, so at it's farthest, Mars is about 24 light minutes away. So this means real time communication would be impossible. Uh, so to simulate this, we communicated with mission support with our friends and family, with everybody outside the crew through email that had a delay of 20 minutes put in each way. Um, and through an online tool that also, uh, both introduced a delay and tracked our communications for research. Um, we also had no access to regular interactive sites that you might like to use, like Google, um, which can make problem solving pretty difficult. So when we needed information, um, so with the exception of a few sites like Wikipedia that we did have access to, because if you were going to Mars, you had to download and bring Wikipedia.

Speaker 1:          09:58          Um, so with the exception of that, if we needed information, say, you know, I'm running into some issue, can you search around and see if you can find someone who has the same problem, tell me what they said. I need to describe my problem to mission support in such a way that they will be able to search around on my behalf and get me information back. So this was really a, an excellent exercise in clear communication and it definitely went both ways. So we had to be clear with mission support. They also needed to be clear with us. Uh, so I remember once early in the mission, um, we were quite water constraint. The company that had delivered water to the previous crew had on short notice announced that they weren't willing to drive up the road to the habit anymore. And so we had about, uh, our tanks were about half full and we had no water delivery scheduled or way to get water.

Speaker 1:          10:56          Uh, so we were conserving pretty heavily. We were down to about two gallons per person per day and had been there for maybe a week. It was starting to get smelly and we get an email from mission support saying the water truck is coming and I have never seen this crew work together so well or so quickly. Everybody Sprang into action and got their showers and got laundry going, drained the water from the tank so that we could water the plants. Uh, and in about a half an hour, we drained, um, uh, nearly all of our remaining usable water from the tanks. Uh, so 40 minutes later, you know, 20 minutes here, 20 minutes back, we get a second email that says the water trucks are coming to see if they can get up the road.

Speaker 1:          11:50          It was really, it was an emotional roller coaster that day. Um, so fortunately for us, they were able to get up the road. They weren't there to deliver that day, but they came a few days later, we had an emergency tank that lucky for us was cleaned for the first time just before mission started. Um, so we were able to transfer some water and, you know, not run dry. Um, but it illustrates the importance of clear communication in both ways. When your only method is email. So I, we, the communication delay also meant that, uh, to a large degree, our social support had to come from inside the hat. So we were allowed as much communication as we wanted with family and friends, um, encouraged shoe email with them or a transfer video files, even though I think people didn't end up taking much advantage of that because there's really not a lot of audio privacy in the Hab.

Speaker 1:          12:52          So even something as simple as, hi, I had a fine day, how were you? It feels really awkward when all of your crew is sitting there and can hear you. Um, but so it means that the crew really becomes each others, family, friends, colleagues. It is a self contained social network and all of your support tends to come from that which makes maintaining relationships with each other. Really, really important. Um, so I, as I tell you about the mission, I'm also going to tell you a few conclusions that I drew that I think may be relevant to life here at Google. And this brings me to the first one. Um, so, uh, what I, one thing that I found underlaid a lot of our success, um, both as a team is maintaining our relationships as a group and individually with each other and in our successes at art assign tasks or geological field work or getting data for the researchers, um, was our mutual commitment to doing so.

Speaker 1:          13:57          So early in the mission we sat down as a crew and we wrote a mission statement for ourselves. Um, so of course there are things that we were supposed to do because it was our job, but we decided to decide for ourselves as well what was important to us. And we decided that as a crew we were committed to being a cohesive team, high quality outreach, and getting good data for the researchers. Um, so high quality data and this provided a very important foundation for the rest of the mission. It meant that if, you know, if I'm having an issue with somebody, I need to take them aside. Um, whether it's just that we need to talk and resolve miscommunication or I need them to change their behavior in some way, I know that they're going to be right there with me solving the problem with me, working with me, um, because we already committed to each other to do in a really wholehearted, genuine way. So I, and I, so I encourage teams that need to accomplish something like, I mean, not exactly like this, but need to accomplish something series together, like probably all of you, uh, to come up with principles that you can all be really genuinely committed to two together. Um, and I don't mean goals like, okay, ours, you know, what are we getting done in the next month or something. But, uh, core values like being a cohesive team.

Speaker 1:          15:33          Okay. Back to the, back to the fun stuff. So I'll tell you a little bit about have life now. Um, so as you would need on Mars, all of our food had to be shelf stable for three years and somewhat realistic. Uh, so that meant mostly freeze dried food cans would be too heavy. It'd be too expensive to send their unrealistic. So lots of bags and cans of odd looking stuff like this. I think we have here, uh, milk freeze dried salmon, chicken cubes, beef crumbles, soup and Mozzarella. So surprisingly it was actually not too hard to make delicious food out of this. They smelled really weird, but when rehydrated are delicious, um, so I think one of the had favorites was deep dish pizza for example. It's turns out it's pretty easy to make a decent tomato sauce. You throw in the powder tomato, the dried onions and just keep doing that and some spices until you stop up the water. Um, the cheese, it if you, if you bake it after rehydrating it sort of loses its crunchy inner inner core and um, it gets a lot more palatable.

Speaker 1:          16:48          The exception to this is food that we grow. Uh, so we had a few systems for doing so in the Hab actually, mostly not by the window. Um, both, both because that's ineffective and unrealistic. Uh, we had a couple of hydroponic systems, a crew mate of mine used to work on Veggie, which is the system they use on the ISS for growing vegetables. Um, so he got them to send us prototype and he was working with that as well as its earthbound outreach focused counterpart growing beyond earth. So we had those in the Hab and got quite a bit of produce from them as well as just some grow lights in the back that we could grow stuff with. So we had, not a lot but enough for a bite every so often of various greens and peas, beans, even a few tomatoes that were a, an occasional treat. I remember once, um, Earl, my crewmate who works on Veggie and I were, uh, we'd harvest it about a month's worth of, of leafy stuff and we were making a salad and Jay smelled it from his room. So upstairs door closed, he comes out, are you cutting lettuce?

Speaker 1:          17:58          So it really was a treat, but, uh, so, um, we did not bring all of our food with us to begin with. Uh, we had, we probably could have lived off of what was in the Hab to begin with. Uh, but we got three or four, what we call resupplies throughout the mission, Aka Hab Christmas. Um, so you can see here a pretty typical resupply. Uh, we've got tomato flakes, beef crumbles, I think some strawberries and in the back, the all important toilet paper. Um, so at every resupply, uh, so for the resupplies we'd submit our requests for what we wanted a month, about maybe two months in advance, and then the resupply would be for two, three months. So we were planning many months ahead, but did get to have some input as far as our taste in food. Um, if you were actually going to Mars, the crew would probably know each other for years ahead of time and would be able to help plan the food that gets sent.

Speaker 1:          19:02          Um, but it turned out that for each resupply, there tended to be something that we didn't, didn't budget per perfectly, um, one resupply. It was paper towels that we were really looking forward to. Another, I think it was onions and once I, it was bananas. So two crew mates of mine, we're really looking forward to the freeze dried bananas. We'd been out for a month or something. Um, and they loved the freeze dried bananas. So I, my crew mate and I who were out picking up the resupply that day, uh, you know, we get to where it is and there's a big box and it says bananas. And so it's 20 pounds of freeze dried bananas, which for reference the boxes, maybe this big, like I could fit in that box. It's a lot of bananas. So we tell them over the radio, we got bananas. Uh, and as we're bringing them back up, um, it was, it was dark at the time. And I see that we have this led strip in the Hab and they turned it on to be a rainbow strobe light. And the Hab was pumping out Gwen Stefani, the a an a, there was a lot of excitement in the hat that day.

Speaker 1:          20:16          So, uh, another way in which the mission was somewhat realistic, uh, was in our limited resources. Um, so these are our solar panels with very little exception. All of our energy came from these, so cloudy days we'd need to conserve sunny days less. So, um, if we did, if we had multiple cloudy days in a row, we had a backup generator generator, we could run, um, keep critical hab systems up and running. Uh, and if for some reason we weren't able to go out, for example, we had some pretty heavy sustained winds. At one point we had hydrogen fuel cells that would kick in as a backup. Um, so we weren't actually in, we had lots of redundancy and weren't in danger of our systems going down or anything. Um, but mainly our power was from solar, uh, which ended up being less constraining than the water.

Speaker 1:          21:17          Um, so, uh, since high seas is a psychological study, they are simulating things, um, well enough to be relevant psychologically. So for example, our water was limited, but we weren't actually exercising recyclers. It came from tanks. Um, so, uh, it was sort of up to us to limit our use. Um, I think possibly, again, for legal reasons, they're not allowed to tell us not to use water. Um, but I, so we ended up using about five to six gallons per person per day for reference. This is about 5% of what the average American uses. Uh, so we did this with, uh, a few methods including, um, you know, bucket bathing rather than showering. So we were allowed eight minutes of shower per week, but often chose to use that in a couple bunches with, um, a little bit of bathing between, um, this is, you can see here our dishes set up.

Speaker 1:          22:21          So we've got our grind bucket, our soap bucket are rinse bucket, uh, that we can, that allows us to do a whole dinners worth of dishes with only a couple extra gallons cause we can sort of move everything left as we go and reuse the water as it gets. Or, um, so it was up to us to come up with this sort of system to conserve a, and one important way or thing that we had that allowed us to do so was that we had composting toilets. Um, so we had a couple of these in the habit was up to us to keep them happy, which was important to both their and our quality of life. Um, so we turned to them a couple times a week, put in microbes and then empty them once a week. One of the more glamorous aspects of living on Mars, it was actually a somewhat coveted chore because although it's not super pleasant, it can sort of end up being a bonding experience.

Speaker 1:          23:22          You know, you either end up with someone who's really okay with it and then that's kind of fun, or who's I entertained by not being okay with it. And then that's just fun for both of you, for one of you. Um, so I, it was a somewhat coveted chore because it took less time than the other chores. Um, and was ended up being kind of fun, at least for me because I didn't really mind it. Um, so I, in addition to, uh, the resource conservation and the shelf stable food, uh, we had to exercise quite a bit. So this was both for our own health because we're in this very small space for a long time. We need to keep our hearts healthy and such. Uh, but also because on Mars you would have to exercise quite a bit, we think, uh, to maintain your bone density and muscle mass and also your health since you would be in a confined space.

Speaker 1:          24:20          So we had about an hour and a half allocated each data exercise. Um, I think on the ISS it's even more, it might be two or three hours per day. Uh, but so the simulated the time drain and the energy drain of having to exercise that much. Um, so lastly, uh, both for our own psychological wellbeing and health as a group community, we had quite a lot of fun together. So we'd watch movies, play Games, um, have special dinners. We had a couple of Hibachi nights where two crew members would get out the griddle and um, marinade some of the beef cubes and then chop it all up on the griddle and throw things at each other. This is a picture of a, one of our open mic nights. So we had a couple of these, uh, we would sort of rearrange the hat and turned it into a coffee shop, take out some of the tables that we used for some of the research tasks and perform things for each other. So it was, uh, it was really up to us to make the, have a lively social environment. And that was one of the parts I enjoyed most about it.

Speaker 1:          25:35          Yes. Yes they are. We made some donuts.

Speaker 1:          25:40          Um, we had flour and yeast, which you could argue is more like two years shelf stable. Um, but would probably be good enough, especially if you kept it in the right conditions. Um, I also had a sourdough starter for, uh, for most of the mission and then it got too cold for it. Um, and also I stopped feeding it in one of these things. Probably killed it. So I get asked a lot, what do we do all day? So we're kicked him in. The stone were pretending to be on Mars. What's our actual job? So first and foremost, we are lab rats. We are the subjects of the primary research. Um, so as part of this we give spit and hair samples. These will be measured after the mission, um, for stress hormones to study both how this varies monthly throughout the mission and how it varies throughout the day.

Speaker 1:          26:32          So I'm on certain days will give several spit samples throughout the day and those will be give you the daily rhythm. And then every month we shave a little bit of our heads. So I have bald spot for science now. Um, we also wear sociometric badges. So these measure our proximity to each other. I only four hours a day, not all the time. Um, so these measure our proximity to each other and the volumes of our voices and are also connected to, uh, to heart rate monitors. So we hear that from this. They can tell whether we're having an argument or whether we're avoiding each other. Though, I think they may be more accurately detecting whether we were playing video games.

Speaker 1:          27:14          So we also were 24, seven, a act to watches which are, which have accelerometers and light sensors as part of a sleep study. Um, so in addition to the actual physical metrics, we do quite a few team activities. Um, so here's one for example. Uh, there's sometimes games or things that we need to do to calibrate the equipment. Um, and through these and through surveys associated with them, the researchers are measuring our communication with each other, our interactions with each other, how well we're cooperating, the sort of thing. Um, I also get asked if we recorded and we were, we were asked to record some portions of our life. So for example, all of our meetings were recorded and they'll be analyzed for, you know, who's speaking up, who's being heard, um, how are we interacting? Uh, and also all of our I eva data is both audio and video recorded.

Speaker 1:          28:19          And then we bundle that up and send it to the researchers. And the lastly, they get a lot of information through surveys. So we did a lot of surveys, more than a thousand each. First thing when we wake up, the last thing before we go to bed, we fill out surveys. These are everything from a self perceived stress to uh, surveys, asking about how we're doing, treating us as a family, to uh, describe what happened to this week, what was most difficult in these different ways. So that's where a lot of the data for the study is coming from.

Speaker 1:          28:58          So we also had quite a bit of time allocated for personal projects. Uh, so mine, I brought a drone and I basically focused on what it could be used for. So, uh, I use ditch to build models of relevant parts of the area around the Hab. Um, used it for a scouting both to try and find things and uh, to look at an area without having to go there first. Um, this is a model that I built with it. Um, and it turns out you can do all sorts of things. Once you've got an elevation model, you can compute elevation profiles from that slopes, changes in elevation volumes. Um, all kinds of useful stuff. Other people on the crew we're working, like I said, on Veggie, I, one person was working on manufacturing, um, molecules in a constrained lab like you might have on Mars. Um, useful for things like medicine. Since one problem about, or one challenge for long duration space flight is that a lot of medicine has a shelf life of less than you'd probably be out there. Uh, so being able to manufacture this sort of stuff in situ is pretty important. Um, others were looking at, uh, optimizing our resource usage in the hab sampling, lava tubes for what might be growing there, three d printing, a bunch of stuff.

Speaker 1:          30:26          Um, and lastly, we spent quite a bit of time on Eva. So Eva stands for extra vehicular activity. This is when we suit up and go outside the hat. Um, but it's not that simple. So if we want to go outside of the Hab, uh, the day before we have a meeting, we plan what we're going to do. Um, we practice it if necessary. We write up a request and we send it to mission support. If they approve it, then the next day, about a half an hour before we're scheduled to go out, we gather our personnel, equipment, batteries, water, whatever. We need a suit up, get ready, and we still can't go outside. Um, because if you were actually on Mars, the outside pressure on the inside pressure are very different and the outside pressure is not so suitable for humans and the [inaudible] if you just opened the door, the people inside would probably not.

Speaker 1:          31:17          Thank you. Um, so we simulate decompression by sealing off a part of the Hab and waiting for a little while. So once we decompress, we, um, well, I mean for a defined a little while. Uh, so once we decompress so we can go outside, we follow the route that we planned ahead of times. Um, we are constrained by the time that we requested. Uh, we come back in, I, we recompress and we're still not done because we need to debrief with each other. We need to process a lot of the data from the eva write summaries, send them to mission support. Um, so going outside, although it's quite atonomous in the actual execution of it, is still highly controlled as it probably would be if you were on Mars. Given that going outside is one of the more dangerous things you would have to do a and throughout the whole thing, we stay in contact with each other of your radio and are required at all times to be in contact with the person inside the Hab who's called Hab calm or ivy for intro vehicular.

Speaker 1:          32:27          Uh, so this brings me to the second thing I'd like to talk to you about, which is this process. So we found we had a, a great number of successful EBS and a great number of unsuccessful PDAs and found that the successful ones were usually do too good, uh, execution of this process. And when we had an unsuccessful one, it was usually because we'd failed somewhere in here. So I think usually when people think, oh, I have something critical I need to do, I'll plan it and then I'll do it. Um, but there's more to it than that. So for example, once we were, we were trying to measure a cross sections of a lava tube, we were trying to validate a digital method that weed, um, that we wanted to use for future tasks. And so we were choosing cross sections to measure and that turned out to be really contentious.

Speaker 1:          33:23          When you were out in the field, um, one person would say, this is the cross section we need another would say it's too close to the opening, there's too much ambient light here and there's really, it's not the place to have a discussion like this. You need to have had that kind of discussion before you go out and when you out. It's just time for execution. Um, and we figured out when we got back in, it was because the different people out had different ideas of what problem we were trying to solve with the data that we were collecting. So we hadn't done a good enough job of defining the problem that we had. Um, another time we were, uh, we were planning an emergency route in case we needed to, to do a simulated evacuation to a lava tube. So if you were on Mars, occasionally there are periods of higher radiation.

Speaker 1:          34:13          Um, you know, the sun releases a bunch of particles and here we're protected by our magnetosphere, but on Mars you'd need to shield yourself somehow. And one suggestion is that people might hunker down in a lava tube until it passes. So we were planning an evacuation route to a lava tube nearby, um, and uh, because we knew that this sort of thing might come day or night, we needed to mark it out in a way that would be easy to follow at night as well. So we actually, we went out ahead of time, um, requested a night eva and tested the different kinds of markers we had. And it turns out that what we thought would work well, we had these super shiny pieces of tape was impossible to see unless you had it at just the right angle because it would reflect your flashlight off somewhere.

Speaker 1:          34:59          That wasn't your eyes. Um, but we had these little orange flags that turned out to be super fluorescent and those worked really well. So we ended up finding this out in marking the path with them. Um, we did a simulated or we requested to practice at night to make sure that it worked, which was one of the odder experiences because it was one of the times when we were all outside together. So usually two out, two in for safety. Um, but we had gotten permission to practice this evacuation and so all six of us were out with our supplies at night and I was imagining what someone would think if they found us six people in a line in Hazmat suits walking across the lava in the middle of nowhere. I, I'd be concerned. Um, so I think this, this process applies to, uh, any, any group that needs to do something critical, something that needs to go right the first time.

Speaker 3:          36:03          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          36:06          So we did EBS for a variety of reasons. Um, a lot of it was purely operational. Take down the trash, take down the poop. This is the, um, the pile that we had near the end of the mission. I think the last pickup was around three months ago. Um, so this is the sort of stuff you don't want hanging around in the Hab. Um, we go down to pick up resupplies I sometimes check on our water tank, see how the levels are doing a run the generator if we need to, which we did a couple of times.

Speaker 3:          36:35          MMM.

Speaker 1:          36:37          We were also assigned quite a bit of geological field work. This is actually the main reason that we go outside is to collect data of various sorts. I on the area around the hub. Um, so some of it was straight up measurements. Um, because of the geological field work is part of the study. A lot of it is focused on our teamwork. While we do it. The tasks are actually are part of the control between missions. So each mission gets the same ones, which is why I won't tell you a ton about them. Um, but, uh, so like I was saying, a lot of it turned out to be straight up physical measurements of things around the Hab. Um, some of it was mapping the geological units. So, you know, go see where flows intersect and try and figure out, you know, what came first, how old is this?

Speaker 1:          37:28          Some of it was pretty qualitative. Um, so look at things like this, that I are, these really weird formations. You know, there's this thing on the top of the hill. And last I checked, lava flowed like a liquid and obeyed the laws of gravity. So how did these weird lumps that are about this big come to be? So go look at them and try and deduce what, how they formed, what happened here. Um, and some of it was, uh, more focused on the inside. Take samples, come in. This is a picture of, and all of you and crystal and a chunk of a boy float near the Hab.

Speaker 1:          38:13          Um, we were also working with a team out of NASA Goddard. So this is, this instrument is a called a mini LHR miniature laser Heterodyne radiometer or something. Um, it measures trace gases in the column of air between it and the sun. So they were looking at co two and methane in the atmosphere. Uh, so this had two purposes. They were actually using the data from this. And it was also a study of how we would communicate with the researchers behind it to collect the data to fix it. When things went wrong. It did at one point get out of alignment and we were figuring out how to level it and what might be wrong with it. Um, we've got to do quite a few emergency drills, um, which tended to be a lot of fun. And we also got, uh, quite a bit of freedom to, um, to go on exploratory vas.

Speaker 1:          39:01          So go out and check out lava tubes are skylights or I just go see things that looked like they might be interesting on Google earth or a that we'd seen in a drone flight. And this brings me to the third thing I'd like to talk to you about. Um, so this is us in a lava tube. That was one of my favorite parts. Um, so over and over we found that work that we did for one reason, whether it was for fun, just because we thought it might be interesting, we want it to go there. Um, or maybe we were out with the drone filming just to, just to film. Uh, we'd found we'd find that this work would be useful in unexpected other ways. So maybe we'd happened to get footage of an area that we needed to go for mission-related purposes later and now we can actually make a plan with some knowledge of what it looks like they're, um, instead of with whatever we can glean from Google Earth, which is not much.

Speaker 1:          40:08          Um, or you know, maybe we've actually been there before. It's a lava tube that we've already explored. So for example, once we mapped a lava tube system just for fun to try mapping, uh, but ended up, uh, knowing the right amount about it to use it for an emergency drill later. Um, so to some extent, I'm preaching to the choir here, Google with its 20% time. Um, but we, I encourage all of you to continue what exploratory work you do. Um, because in my experience it is very, it is valuable in unexpected ways. Um, and in my opinion that applies to space flight as a whole as well. Um, there have been many, many unexpected benefits to life on earth from the space programs so far. For example, I think there was a, uh, fuel valve and the shuttle, maybe you've heard of this, that turned out to be just perfect for, um, the time between when you need a heart and when you get a heart for little kids, like they hadn't figured out how to make reliable little valves like that until they did it for the shuttle and now they can use them for hearts anyway.

Speaker 1:          41:26          So I can't tell you too much about the actual geology tasks, but I can tell you some about the various challenges of being on Eva. Um, so this is me trying to, I think trying to fit in that hole, um, which is a bit difficult in these suits because they're quite bulky, um, as suits would be.

Speaker 3:          41:48          MMM.

Speaker 1:          41:49          You also had some some visibility issues. So this was one of the ways in which having the mini Lhr there, which was attempted to, they attempted to build it for our situation. Um, but we turned out to have a lot of challenges with it. I think this person is trying to see the screen.

Speaker 3:          42:08          MMM.

Speaker 1:          42:09          And this person is trying to see an illuminated dot that is sort of right at the base of the barrel there. Um, again, an exercise in communication, we uh, this may be relevant to you as well, but we found videos to be a much easier way of sending scientific information. Then written descriptions. So here we were told that it is aligned if you see an illuminated dot. And so we thought there must be an led. We can kind of squint and see through the visor. This thing that looks like it might be an led. So I think this person is trying to see if the led is on. Turns out the illuminated.is created by a shadow. So at the end of the barrel, there's this little hole. And if it's perfectly aligned with the son, then the son will cast this little spot right on what is a sensor not in led. And so when we were looking for a v illuminated dot, we were actually just making it go away by shading the whole thing with our enormous head.

Speaker 3:          43:15          MMM.

Speaker 1:          43:16          You can see the visibility here. I can, I can see so well that I can't tell my phone is in the picture.

Speaker 3:          43:24          MMM.

Speaker 1:          43:25          And so some of these are relevant to our suits and some of them are relevant to actual suits. One of, uh, one of those things is actual. So it's, we'll have to be pretty durable. Um, this is my suit in the last week or so with the mission when you were patching them up. Uh, so you can see it gets pretty beat up. Um, and earth lava, while sharp is still not as sharp as Mars lava weathering is easier here. Um, so in case any of you ever built a space suit, make it really tough.

Speaker 1:          44:03          Um, lastly, I eenie has happened in a hazardous environment. No, I'm just kidding. That's not about a hazardous environment, although that is my crew mate at the bottom of a pit. Um, so one consideration for setups on eva is the communication system. Uh, so because it's important to have communication at all times between basically between earth and Mars, even though it's delayed, I you will need some way to explore all of the varieties of terrain on Mars, especially lava tubes because those are one of the most interesting places on Mars as a potential habitable, habitable area. Um, so at the moment I'm relaying to have calm what my crew mate in the pit says to me and he's relaying for the team down the tube. Uh, and so communication, something to be solved. So the mission ended on September 17th. We were in there for 242 days total. Um, six people went in the same six people went out. So that's a success in my book. All right. And we built a team from this group of strangers

Speaker 2:          45:22          and I'm happy to take questions.

Speaker 4:          45:31          Please use the microphones if that's okay. Thanks for sharing. Um, so you mentioned that part of mission five was about team selection. Also. Can you tell us a little about the selection process?

Speaker 1:          45:44          Sure. Um, so what I can tell you what I experienced from the selection process. Um, so the, the first step that actually involve my interaction was a whole bunch of psychological surveys. So things like everything from what time of day you like to be awake to how you cope with stress. Um, just a whole bunch of different screens. Uh, the second part was an asynchronous interview, so it was a system where it asks you questions, you have something like a minute to think in, three minutes to record. Um, and that was the process.

Speaker 5:          46:31          There was six people. Can you go down into how goals six people operate you? Do I pray this single crew of six or very good broken down into like Tucson fees? Was there any hierarchy like sort of like gene bleed that drive 70 bucks?

Speaker 1:          46:50          Yeah. Um, so I'll answer your last question first. We had a commander that was the extent of her hierarchy. So commander everyone else. Um, the, for the most part we found that sort of formal authority not to be necessary. We did most stuff by consensus. The exception was eva where we found a formal chain of command to be really important for getting things done effectively and efficiently. Um, so for the most part we operated as in work for the most part we operated as a team of six. Sometimes there would be certain people who are more interested in different things and we tend to work on them more. Um, but we saw it as our group responsibility to complete them one way or the other, whether that was a couple of people that are interested in volunteer or we all pitch in. Um, socially I think people tended to break up a bit more. Um, so we, we did spend a lot of time as a group. We also spend a lot of time in twos and threes.

Speaker 1:          48:00          Thanks for sharing. Um, can you talk about the psychological results? You said that that was what they were studying. Have you guys, um, and I guess they probably haven't, maybe they haven't released the, the result of publicly, but at least like qualitative qualitatively from your perspective, like how people changed over the time that you were there? Um, the, the short sad answer is no. Um, both because the research is still ongoing since the next mission is part of it. Um, and because as a participant, I'm not privy to the researchers conclusions yet. Um, they'll publish and probably a couple of years once the next mission has done. Um, I know that personally I think I became more independent person as a result of the mission. Um, I definitely improved my interpersonal skills. Um, but I, I can't say anything about broader conclusions.

Speaker 2:          49:08          Hi,

Speaker 1:          49:09          thank you for sharing. It's been really interesting hearing about your experiences. Um, I'm curious to know what's next for you now that you've come back, what are you up to? What's your next step? Um, that's a, that's a great question. I'll let you know. Do you have any specific interests? Are you exploring a wide variety of different, um, I, I definitely would like to continue, continue contributing to space exploration in one form or another. Um, whether that's through work, studying, volunteering.

Speaker 1:          49:50          I was a question about your drone project. So was that useful because it was higher resolution than like satellite images because twin was like shifting on my list because what a terrain would potentially be like changing on Mars. Um, so for us we found it useful exactly as you say, because it's much higher resolution. Um, and also because it's targeted. So, um, right. I can't say we were successful, but at one point we tried to search for a wast water bottle for example, had fallen down someone's pants leg and um, we, we didn't recover it. We did find a Bush that was surprisingly similar in color. Yeah. But mainly because we could, we could go get images of what we wanted and they were, they were much higher resolution, satellite imagery, the imagery, and interestingly often easier to spot things on. Then when we went in person. Uh, so for example, there was, there was one feature where it had a I a shape that was not really noticeable on the ground because it's sort of in the, the subtleties of how the rocks fall, but it's really easy to spot from an aerial image.

Speaker 1:          51:08          So yeah, it filled the gap between ground and satellite.

Speaker 5:          51:12          What surprised you most about your time?

Speaker 2:          51:18          Um, that's a good question.

Speaker 1:          51:22          I have no idea about most. But one thing that surprised me was how accustomed I got to the communications delay. Um, so I was expecting it to be weird to come out in a lot of ways and it ended up feeling pretty normal except for instant communication. So we're so used to, you know, you send an email, the person doesn't even get it for 20 minutes. Um, and so I'd send emails and get a response back in two minutes and it felt creepy, like in the, I didn't know you were looking kind of way. Um, yeah. So that surprised me.

Speaker 5:          52:04          How did this experience affect your relationships with friends and family? Uh, when earth, so to speak, both during and after this experience.

Speaker 1:          52:14          That's a good question. Um, so I think that the mission was particularly tough for me in that regard, um, because I got married about four months before the mission. Um, so I guess in a way I'm, I'm still discovering the ways in which relationships have changed, but it was, it was definitely a challenge for me and my husband to figure out how to, how to be supportive of each other when being an immediate emotional support or person to vent to isn't really an option. Um, and figuring out ways to stay connected. So for example, we had a few movie date night, so we'd set a time to start a movie and then send a bunch of email back and forth during. So it's still delayed, but if you send enough of it, it sort of feels like you're chatting.

Speaker 5:          53:19          Hi. Thank you for sharing. Um, what kind of personal effects read aloud to bring and kind of on the same note, uh, what did you miss most when you got there and now that you're back, what do you miss most about being there?

Speaker 1:          53:32          Okay. Um, so we were allowed to bring two suitcases of anything except food. Um, though I smuggled in some astronaut ice cream, so I brought a suitcase of clothes, mostly warm clothes. I have a suitcase of craft supplies and a bio Lynn. Um, different people made different choices. I think what I miss the most besides obviously people while I was there was probably fruit. Um, and I, I would definitely say I miss my crew most now that I'm back. Um, but again, people is kind of a cop out. So I guess I'd say I miss the, uh, we had a really a really nicely scheduled by, so it was pretty consistent. It was, um, we had a tool that we use to communicate what we were doing. Uh, that meant that every minute of the day was, we knew what we were supposed to be doing. Um, including pre sleep posts, sleep, lunch, they hit, it was all scheduled in there. Um, so I think having that, that tool and that structure to my day.

Speaker 2:          54:46          Right.

Speaker 5:          54:49          Thank you very much. Laura. This was fantastic talk. Um, that's it for questions, but, um, I assume you're going to hang around for a little bit of, can run it, talk to you offline, and we encourage you to stay for the APE team coming up next to talk about your machine learning resource here in New York.
