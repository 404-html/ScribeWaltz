Speaker 1:          00:06          [inaudible].

Speaker 2:          00:12          Thank you very much and thanks for coming and thanks for hosting. Um, I'd like to tell you about, uh, well this book, it's a been a long journey and it's a little unusual. So I thought I'd tell you a bit about, you know, how I came to, uh, make the book and why and then a little bit about the content. But I'm going to save, uh, hopefully most of the time just to chat with you if you would like to about, uh, uh, the book, whether it be how it's made or what's in it. So let me tell you a festival, a little bit about the mission. So, uh, among the things I do besides, uh, research in areas of a theoretical physicists, physics, uh, and of course teaching the usual Professor Gig, uh, is, uh, I also like to be out there in the world trying to get people excited about science, trying to share the excitement about science and trying to do what I think is very important, which is to increase people's comfort with science. Let it be really part of everyday conversation. Like any other aspect of, of our culture. So, uh, in that regard, uh, I think that we should do a better job of embedding science in many aspects of our lives. And one of the things that this book is trying to do is to encourage that in various ways, as you'll see. So anyway, that's meant to be sort of everyday people out there in the world and you'll see how it fits in later on. But let's take a step back to the core idea.

Speaker 2:          01:53          And this goes back actually many years, uh, to the, uh, the sorts of questions that people would ask me, Oh, almost 20 years ago about, uh, when I'm going to write that book. And, and what people usually mean by that is that an academic who's out there in the world talking about their fields, usually at some point writes a book and it's a book of a certain sort. And, uh, it's, um, it sort of,

Speaker 3:          02:19          uh, um,

Speaker 2:          02:23          an ancient tradition and in, in, in, in, in certain ways. And, uh, I didn't actually feel any urgency to write such a book. And one of the reasons is, is that I didn't feel we were necessarily reaching new people with the kind of book that we write. Um, uh, those books are wonderful. They do a very important service and I'll probably end up writing some one day, but at that time I didn't feel that the world really needed another one from me. And, um, I, uh, I was also distracted by very exciting things going on in research at the time. Um, but the core idea that came to me was that there was a kind of book out there that actually I hadn't seen. And so that got me interested in maybe trying to do that. And it's a sort of book that you might, uh, um, uh, uh, read and feel more invited to be part of the conversation about science.

Speaker 2:          03:18          And so the idea of conversations about science, uh, became sort of first and foremost in my mind how to really celebrate those conversations that I really know are going on in the world out there. And that I really think that everyone should feel free to have. And so a book entirely about conversations, uh, was what came to be. And then they realized it was very much in the tradition of, um, the dialogues of Plato. And also you may know very famously of, of, of Galileo, a lot of Galileo's most famous ideas, uh, that we know him for actually were first communicated in the form of a book in dialog form those where in some ways the popular books of the day for those, for those who, uh, um, who read about such discussions. And uh, so, so, so I have on screen, um, a little screenshot of a dialogues, uh, uh, Galileo and also, uh, the platonic dialogues, Socratic dialogues I should say of a Plato. And so that was sort of the idea, but it was still very much a prose book. Um, but it was at least a step along the way.

Speaker 2:          04:28          The next thing I thought it'd be interesting is to also show what happens when you have conversations. You get sort of animated into a conversation about some aspect of science and maybe you scribble and doodle a little bit and those scribblings and doodles got actually can be kind of interesting. And I thought it'd be fun to sort of show some of those scribbles and doodles and a book. So it was sort of still a prose book in my mind, but with some illustrations showing, showing a little bit of that because that can be interesting. And then as time went by, sort of years went by, had shelved the idea, I came back to it and then I thought, oh, wouldn't it be interesting to see the people having the conversation? That would be unusual. And maybe that would be a way of drawing you in some more.

Speaker 2:          05:08          You're wondering who these people are, how did they come to meet and so on and so forth. So that seems like an interesting device that could take the book further in a direction that, uh, maybe reaches new kinds of people. And I thought, well, it would be nice to show where these people are having those conversations. And that would be great because science, which still unfortunately has this, this image of being, uh, the sort of specialized topic done by special people in special places, uh, you know, seminar rooms and labs and things where it'd be nice to show that science is happening. Conversations between ordinary people out there in the, in the world. So places these conversations in cafes out there in the world and on trains where people are, where people meet. And so that was what I started, uh, uh, imagining to do.

Speaker 2:          05:59          And these are some snapshots from what, what eventually became the book. Uh, and then I got a bit carried away and, uh, a little bit perhaps detailed, obsessed, but it was very much the idea of trying to place the conversations about science between ordinary people out there in ordinary places. Some of you may or may not recognize that's a, that's a real, uh, location and, uh, it's, you know, really trying to get that idea across. So anyway, I, uh, spent a fair amount of time making the book and, uh, I'll tell you a bit more about that in a moment. But let's first talk about what you actually see when you, when you, when you, uh, when you, when you open the book and indeed you'll see conversations and it will be between people, various pairs of people and uh, what's going on is that they're having conversations about, uh, ideas about our universe.

Speaker 2:          06:56          Uh, I'm writing what I know, so I'm mostly in this, uh, incidents are mostly talking about, um, aspects of how our universe works. Uh, from the point of view of physics. Uh, in various ways. It isn't all abstract, esoteric conversations about, you know, black holes and the big bang and what have you. There's a lot of everyday science in there as well because they think these things are all connected. One of the other great things about having it in conversation form is that you can show that connectivity conversations aren't ever really just about one topic, a real conversation. They tend to wander a little bit and go off and sort of interesting a serendipitous directions. So using that and trying to represent that and conversation allows me to show that, uh, lots of science topics are interconnected, which is another nice thing to be able to get across.

Speaker 2:          07:49          So there's conversations in cafes, on trains between various kinds of people. Some are scientists and we're not scientists. And, um, one of the fun things I also get to do is, is, is to break another major rule about how the science books as supposed to work, which is that I can show equations and I can talk about equations. And if you like, you can treat the equations as part of the art that's decorating a, the book, um, or you can look a little bit closer and, and, and, and try and connect what's going on in the equations to what's going on in the conversation. And there are some of the conversations that actually, uh, don't shy away from saying, no, let's look at these equations. It's okay. Don't run screaming. Um, uh, you know, you're an audience so it wouldn't run screaming. But unfortunately, we have, uh, this view in society that somehow mathematics is this scary thing.

Speaker 2:          08:39          And, uh, you're advised as a, as a, as a, as author of popular level books, not to put equations and your books because it'll, it'll, it'll scare your audience away. Every equation, uh, supposedly half of the audience or something like that. It has been said. Um, I think that's ridiculous. Uh, mathematics is one of the major tools of how we, uh, arrive at ideas, uh, manipulate ideas and, um, and uh, have a dialogue with nature. And why would you leave that out in any, in any discussion, um, uh, in depth about how science has done so. So, so I have that, I have that there and actually have a discussion between these two characters where, where, uh, one of them is actually saying, no, no, no. Treat it like you treat, uh, going into an art gallery, right? You don't know everything about how paintings are done, but you can get something out of it.

Speaker 2:          09:31          You won't get everything, but that's okay. You'll, you'll look at the painting, maybe you'll come back another day, you'll look again, you'll get something else, treat equations on the page the same way. So that's sort of the idea is I'm trying to change things and in terms of, of what we do with a science books about supposedly difficult topics. Um, and again, I should emphasize there's nothing wrong with the existing kinds of books that are done, uh, that, uh, and that should continue. It's, it's a, it's just that I think we can do so much more and, and, and engage so many more people. So that's, uh, one of the core ideas of doing, uh, uh, what I'm doing. So here's some more, here's a more people in conversation in various kinds of locations, different kinds of artistic styles and so on and so forth.

Speaker 2:          10:16          Um, all in all, what I can do is talk about science on many different levels. That was one of the things that I realized, uh, when I was, uh, uh, in the middle of doing the book after I arrived at the idea that what I was really doing was a graphic novel. And to be honest, uh, it, it hadn't occurred to me that I was doing a graphic novel until very late in the process until I really had thought conversations, um, show equations, show scribblings show locations, and then it occurred to me, oh my goodness, I really, really should be doing this as narrative art. This is a graphic novel if you like the images had, had, had, had eaten the pros and a and taken over the whole book. And then in my mind it sort of clicked. It's a graphic novel. As soon as I realize that, then I realized two things.

Speaker 2:          11:03          One, no one had ever done this before. And, uh, so I, I really needed to do it to show that it could be done. And second, it allows you to do so many things in terms of how you talk about the ideas. Looking at the screen here, you can see several sorts of things going on. I have, for example, uh, showing the scribblings as I promised, I'm actually showing some, you know, how, how a theorist might write some equations about a particular issue that's being discussed. So that's one thing I can talk about. I can have the people talking, uh, and you know, speech bubbles about them talking so you can hear what they're talking. So that's one level I can go to a more abstract level where I also show some of the tools, um, in, in more abstract sense, uh, of, of a, of what's going on in physics, for example.

Speaker 2:          11:52          That, uh, that diagram in the center is something a, you may have heard of. It's called the Feynman diagram. It's arguably one of the most powerful tools ever invented to compute things that we confront with nature and test with nature to incredible accuracy. Um, um, and, uh, it's an amazing tool and it's basically a cartoon. That's what we actually use in physics. It's a cartoon. It belongs in a book that also using that language. And in fact, I build panels around it and show, and you can, you, if you read it in the way you're supposed to read a comic panels, you'll also reconstruct the physics that's going on, which is rather nice. So I can show that a level of abstraction, but I can go further. I can also talk about another level of a, of what's going on with the physics, uh, using this, this mode that I really can't do in any other medium.

Speaker 2:          12:43          And I'll say a little bit about that shortly. And then I can also, uh, have the, uh, the conversation lists either with real or imagined objects, engage with the physics as well. So that's another sort of visual level that I can play with all on the same page. So there's really no other medium that can do this. And I, I feel this, there's a lot of potential here for, for doing so much more, uh, in this, uh, in this space, uh, with this mode of, uh, of communication. And then I can also do some, some, uh, some playful things. For example, here's a, a couple talking in a, in a, in a, in a, in a square at a table, and they're actually talking about the physics of multiverses and black holes and so on and so forth. And there's an idea of how, um, uh, you have a branching structure where, where, um, uh, universities, uh, uh, in, in some theory separating from each other and branching out and, and, uh, I'm actually without banging it too much on the head, you're viewing that you're viewing them through the branches of an overhead tree.

Speaker 2:          13:47          And so there's again, a resonance with the, with the, uh, with the conversation in the, uh, in the decoration if you like. And then I can go really a sort of off the reservation and, and also have sort of big metaphorical discussions. They actually start, this couple starts, um, having a fanciful discussion, uh, about some physics analogies with, uh, with ideas and, um, in, in, in paradise lost. And I can actually go crazy and actually sort of draw bets and things like that as well. So, so you, you can really play on many levels in the service of, of, of having fun, uh, with the idea and really, um, still, uh, have a serious discussion about some important ideas in science. So let me say a little bit about methods because people are very curious about how you make these things and how I went about making it.

Speaker 2:          14:37          Um, well, it all goes down to, uh, figuring out whether I could draw a, at the level needed to, uh, to carry it, to carry this off. And, and the answer is that I, that I couldn't at the beginning, I had to teach myself. And, uh, you know, this as a side remark is a very important thing to emphasize, which is that drawing, uh, like many other things, uh, is, is, is mostly a learned skill that you can actually set out to learn and, and, uh, and practice and do it. It's, it's very little to do with the mythology of natural talent and so on and so forth. So, um, I could, you know, do a bit of drawing and sketching like anyone else, but I really had to put in the time to just practice and learn the skill set needed and then study the actual, a whole industry of how you make graphic novels and um, and uh, and try and learn those techniques.

Speaker 2:          15:30          But mostly there's just putting in the time to draw. So, uh, the caring sketch books around with me and, uh, um, just a drawing every time I got the opportunity. Mostly trying to understand the human body, the human face. So trying to, uh, get as many opportunities as possible and public transport is just great for that. Um, although it's getting a bit annoying now because most people that are like this because you know, phones, but, um, maybe I'll do an entire book of the tops of People's heads some point. Um, but anyway, uh, so, so, uh, you know, a lot of, uh, a lot of practicing, uh, various kinds of, uh, uh, techniques, um, uh, uh, going into, uh, life drawing studios and just, uh, um, uh, practicing on, on the, on, on the human body to learn anatomy and practicing faces, practicing digital techniques and, uh, also traditional techniques, drawing buildings, drawing buildings out there in the world, as that's a lot of fun.

Speaker 2:          16:35          I stumbled upon the whole urban sketchers movement, which is wonderful, by the way, if you don't know about it, just Google urban sketchers and you'll find there's a whole movement of people who just go out, that you actually, sometimes around London for example, or any big city, you'll, you'll, you'll see groups of people just sketching, just sort of, they've just descended and they're sketching and it's actually a, it could well be one of the urban sketchers meetups. And, uh, that's, that's actually a fun thing to do. I never had the, uh, never had the time or, or courage to, uh, to, to join such a group. I'm a bit more of a solitary sketcher myself, but, um, maybe I will one day cause it's a, it's a great way of encouraging each other. I understand. So anyway, a lot of techniques then, uh, I learned, uh, particularly to do with make it going from just doing sketches to, to, to learning more graphic styles that are appropriate for, for, for graphic novels and learning how to deal with light and shade and things like that. And then, yes, a old fashion techniques, which I love, like doing a lot of perspective construction by hand, but then also learning how to do perspective construction on computer to speed things up and things like that. Um, and uh, and then traditional banking and digital banking and so on and so forth. Uh, moving forward, uh, here are some examples of sort of,

Speaker 2:          17:58          uh, before and after sketching out ideas which eventually turned into final pages. Um, the part of the process which people sometimes find interesting in some cases I wrote conversations and then designed images to go with them and other cases I did, I designed images. Uh, at the same time as I was thinking about what the conversation around them would be a dependent upon the nature of the topic. And also where I was in the, in the process I started in around 2010, um, having, having realized it should be a graphic book pack in 2006, it took me a while to find the time. And then I had a sabbatical in 2010. And so I started trying to see if I could teach myself to draw at that higher level. Um, and then I was drawing from 2010 until 2016. I'm actually 2017. And, uh, so, uh, styles change, techniques change, workflow, uh, methods changed and so on and so forth. Um, and uh, so these are just some examples of a sketching turning into the final, uh, product.

Speaker 1:          19:01          Okay.

Speaker 2:          19:02          And, uh, this is, this is a good example of a sketch that was done at the same time as the ideas and then turns into the final, uh, discussion, uh, that you see on whatever page it is in the book. Okay. Um, let me move on. There was a, uh, another, um, interesting, uh, level one can get too, which I think is worth talking about a little bit. And, and uh, I sort of think of it, this is the, the discovery that people tend to ask, you know, they go, well, you're a scientist doing research. He was taking time out to this other thing. And then the question always is, has that other thing informed, uh, informed your, your, uh, your physics? Have you, have you discovered anything because you've been doing art? And, um, so the honest answer is, um, not really. Um, I wish, I wish there was a, a fantastic story.

Speaker 2:          19:59          I could tell you. Um, uh, you know, there's, there's, there's nothing I'm going to be writing up in the journal anytime soon. Um, that that came from, from, uh, from, from this enterprise. And I don't think that is a necessary thing to legitimize, uh, doing this. I think, uh, the, the mission we were talking about at the beginning is, is, is, is more than enough. Um, but I should say, uh, generally speaking, the process by which you think clearly or try to think clearly about how to explain ideas to people always reflects, uh, um, always, uh, uh, back, reacts positively on how you think about your actual research. And I'm sure many of you know that. So, so there probably are things as I think about more clearly as a result of having, um, put the time into figuring out how to say it in a, in the book.

Speaker 2:          20:52          Um, but I do, I do have a little bit of a joke, but there's a very serious point, uh, that, that, uh, that I, I did discover a new equation and that's the equation. Comics equals physics. And there's actually a serious point, uh, those of you who are maybe a, I have more than a passing interest in comics know that, uh, there's a well established, um, thing that said, uh, it said very well. And for example, Scott McCloud's books or um, or, um, uh, will Eisner's books about how sequential artworks that comics are not a passive medium. Um, uh, you actually as a reader, you're doing something very active and what you're doing is your, your, your taking a sequence of images that are laid out in a certain order. Um, uh, and with a certain convention about the audio, read them in a and w w once you, once you do that, what you're doing is you're creating space.

Speaker 2:          21:47          You're creating an active sense of space and also have time. There's a sense of passing of time. And it's very important when you're designing comics to actually understand that, um, because it allows you to play with. It allows you to manipulate how the reader gets what you're trying to get them to get a off the page. Um, and, uh, so that's sort of a well known thing, but I, I think one can go actually much further than that because in much of the book I'm talking about ideas about space and time in physics. And so what better medium, uh, to have that kind of discussion in, uh, then, uh, then, uh, a book that's, you know, depends so much on the reader to construct space and time. So, uh, with that in mind, I can actually start playing with the physics ideas by playing with the structure of the page in terms of how the panels are laid out and things like that.

Speaker 2:          22:47          Um, so comics equal physics is sort of a serious thing. I think physics is extremely well adapted to comics. Uh, the construction of space and time that happens in comics. Um, allows you then to do things like this. A, there's a conversation where, uh, the, the, the discussion that's taking place in the field right now about what may happen in the early universe, for example, around the time of the big bang or slightly before, depending upon how you define the big bang space and time itself may not be very much if at all. Um, even close to the way we think of space and time right now. It may break down in, in, in certain interesting ways. So I can actually have that conversation taking place. And while it's taking place in words, it's also happening in the panel structures where the panel itself is dissolving in a way analogous to what's supposed to be happening to space and time, the space and time of our universe that's being this, uh, this, this solution that's happening here actually spreads out onto, um, onto, uh, another, um, another page.

Speaker 2:          23:54          And, uh, and, and it continues there in an interesting way. So it's a little bit playful here. It's not essential to discussion, but it certainly, uh, having the, the page itself resonate with the idea. I think is another way of getting, uh, getting it to sort of sink in what's going on. And, uh, so that sort of Nice. Um, and, uh, it was a fun thing to do once I realized, I realized very late in the process, um, that this was a possibility. So I probably would've done a lot more headache, realized that earlier and I, I, it would be fun to revisit some of that, um, in, in, uh, in perhaps in a, in a sequel. Here's another, um, uh, perhaps a more subtle example, uh, two people that are discussing what, uh, what's, uh, thought to happen, uh, following Einstein's equations.

Speaker 3:          24:40          Um, uh, yeah,

Speaker 2:          24:43          uh, in the interior of a black hole.

Speaker 3:          24:46          Okay.

Speaker 2:          24:47          And, uh, so they're discussing the whole idea of as you go deeper and deeper into the black hole of various kinds of things happen. Um, but, uh, one of the things that Einstein's equations, uh, tells you happens, which we actually think probably gets strongly modified by quantum effects, that we're still trying to figure out, um, is that a space and time begin to, uh, get, uh, confused what you thought of a space is now time, what you thought of his time is now space. It's all getting very confused. So again, I had that in words, but then the other thing I do on this page is I have, um, a resonance a with that idea by having the order in which you read the panels be the wrong order. So I'm sort of breaking down space and time, uh, that you construct as the reader and breaking that down. You're reading in a, in a, in a cyclic order as opposed to the one, two, three, four you would normally do in order to make sense of those words. And so I'm sort of playing with your head a little bit as you're reading about the breakdown of space and time. Uh, you're getting some, some dissonance, some confusion on the page as well, which is, uh, which is deliberate, again, trying to show, uh, through the panel structure that something's funny is happening inside the black hole.

Speaker 2:          26:04          So, um, uh, I'll, I think I'll end there, but just, just end with a few hopes and the hope is, um, that, uh, people find this interesting. People engage with it. But also I hope that this isn't just a, uh, uh, a random weird quirk. And then we just go back to the usual way of, of discussing science in the public sphere. I, you know, I hope that maybe a other,

Speaker 3:          26:29          uh, uh,

Speaker 2:          26:32          writers, scientists, artists might engage more with using science. I'm sorry, using comics and graphic novels for serious discussion of science. You, there are lots of, uh, graphic treatments or science out there, but they're either, um, uh, done with maybe more of a comedic bent or more, you know, more like the sort of Sunday funnies or, you know, sort of Gee Whiz, kind of, uh, science stuff or stuff, uh, for, for children, all of which are wonderful things. This is not any of those things. I think a, a serious discussion, um, uh, where science has the star in character as opposed to it being a biography or something. It's something that you don't really see much, certainly in physics, um, in graphic novel form. And so I, I hope to, I hope that can change and this is an attempt to show that this is something that can be done, uh, can be, uh, successful in terms of communicating the ideas and, um, and get people excited. So a, I'm going to stop babbling now and maybe hear from you

Speaker 1:          27:44          mmm.

Speaker 4:          27:45          As a professor in the university to do, do teaching students stations, do you use some of your skills and all those ideas during the rotation? Like just usual lectures and all that?

Speaker 2:          28:00          Um, that's an interesting question. I certainly don't have, um, know full on graphic narratives, uh, in, in my teaching. Um, uh, you know, I might, uh, it's been a while since I, uh, for example, total freshmen class and maybe I might do it there. Um, uh, it's um,

Speaker 2:          28:23          right, here's his assault something I'll say. Yeah, something else. I think this book is, um, uh, trying to do is to show just how visual, um, the field actually is. And it is already the case that in the classroom or in the seminar room, uh, where one's talking about physics, but one's actually doing physics research as well. It's very, very visual. And I don't think that's appreciated because ironically we have our ideas. Um, you know, we may be billed multibillion dollar machines to discover the particles that came about as a result of those ideas, what have you. And then we go out and we write books about it. And, and, and we're, and we're encouraged to and in fact, take pride in and communicating it all in words and pretending that we'd actually didn't have this huge visual component. So, so actually one of the things I'm trying to do is, is, um, is, is talk more about that visual component, have that visual component much more upfront. So in my, so my classroom is already very visual, um, in the sense that if you walk into my class and look on the board, you will see drawings because that's what we use. Uh, uh, whether it be the equations or diagrams is associated with the equations or even sort of metaphorical sketches about what the interior of the black hole is. We do that all the time already. So, so in some ways I'm just bringing more of that to the page than normally happens.

Speaker 5:          30:02          That is significant efforts to, uh, earlier ice public with the physics, the physics, for example, the space time or the third fermilabs programs. So how do you come where the video way of presenting things with the comic way of a comic book way of presenting things? I mean,

Speaker 2:          30:25          this is a great question. Um, those are wonderful things. Um, and I apologize, you will see my face on a number of them too. Um, and, and uh, and uh, those again, things should be, it should continue. Uh, but, but three different, I think, I think video, um, uneven animation in video form of ideas is a wonderful thing, but it's still quite different. Um, in some ways it's still much more passive. I think reading of any form it engages, engages the reader, uh, in exploring the ideas and fitting it into their head much more than sitting and watching, uh, a thing. Um, so, uh, so in some ways, um, the comic form, uh, the graphic, the graphic novel form is, is, uh, is, is in a very interesting space that's along a sort of different access, but it has commonality with the other forms, but then it has this whole thing unto itself.

Speaker 2:          31:27          Uh, in terms of some of the things I mentioned before, that active engagement, you're creating some of the, the space that's being a, that's being imagined are on many different levels. All those things. I can't think of another medium that does that. People often think of comics as basically stills of a movie. And that, that's such a, such an unfortunate perception. It's so much more than that. And, and, and so that's why it's incredibly frustrating to me that comics are still thought of as either, you know, things for kids or things to talk about superheroes, um, or, or, you know, something that is so much less than what they can be. And, and, and, and so, so, so what I'm trying to do here is show just how much this form can contain if we take it seriously and bring serious topics to it. So I hope that, yeah,

Speaker 6:          32:21          and I'm guessing it's much harder to revise and this kind of presentation. So if you, if you get struck as you say with an interesting idea of how you could do something, it will be a lot of effort to go back and change what you've already done. Is that going to be a barrier to more of this kind

Speaker 2:          32:40          of book? Um, uh, I'm not sure. It depends. It depends upon the kind of change. Um, it possibly also depends upon,

Speaker 3:          32:54          uh,

Speaker 2:          32:58          I'm not sure it's any harder, a harder than re-editing a movie perhaps. Um, yeah, I'm not sure how to answer that. Yes, it can. It can be, uh, difficult to, uh, make changes, particularly if you've designed, if you're really using the medium, well then the page layout is crucial. Making a change here could have a knock on effect on other parts and so on and so forth. And I think of that as a positive thing because it shows that it's a,

Speaker 2:          33:29          it's something very complex going on and so difficult in making changes, you know, that's a thing. But I think if it's worth doing, it's worth doing. I'm not sure how it, how else to answer that, but it's a, it's a good observation though. Um, I, I think, um, there are, you know, I've learned a lot about how to do things quickly, uh, as compared to when I first started out. You know, I, I think, um, I think when I was first doing this or of course even taking into account that I was doing it in my spare time and not full time, uh, it w it would take a very long time just to do one page. By time I got to, uh, the final sprint to hand it in on, on, you know, on deadline to the publisher. Uh, I was doing, um, uh, uh, more than one page per day. Sometimes depending upon the style, uh, you know, a couple of pages a day of, of, of, of final art. Um, so, so there, there are many different sort of types of technique and workflow, some of which are easier to make adjustments to than others. It really depends upon one's one's own chosen style.

Speaker 3:          34:40          Okay.

Speaker 2:          34:41          Back to, well other media. I was just wondering about what a woman could do something similar with interactive web based type presentation, possibly comic based as well, but with the directive. Yeah, there's, there's, there's interactive, um, there's interactive things that can be done on, on, on the web, on devices. Um, uh, there's also, uh, the growing perhaps medium of motion comics and things like that. I think the many things that can be done, um, with, uh, with digital techniques, um, that could be in the spirit of this or, or, or go off in another direction or a law again on a, on a, on a, on a somewhat different access, uh, to explore different aspects. Um, so yes, uh, let's, let's do them all. You talked about being inspired by a lot of the classic dialogues and

Speaker 7:          35:38          all the ones I'm familiar with are between a teacher and a student to our master and a scholar where it seems like one of the Pr people is just there to ask leading questions. Um, did you find yourself using that same frame since I've only spent 10 seconds with the book or did you find another way to modernize it or do,

Speaker 2:          35:53          um, you'll find mixtures of that. I mean, it's certainly the case that, um, that there are some pairings that one person has more expertise in the other. Um, but I still didn't want it to be even in that case. Well, in all of those cases where that happens, I still don't want it to be master and student. Um, because I think that almost defeats the purpose of what I was trying to do. Going back to my, uh, my non critique of the sort of standard books that we write. Um, uh, one of the other things that can turn people off is that that tone of, here I am stepping out of the ivory tower to tell you how you're supposed to think about things. And they really wanted to avoid that tone. Um, and, uh, so even when it is an expert in the non-expert, they really equals out there in the world.

Speaker 2:          36:42          And, and people often go, oh, but it's just another lecture cause that presence an expert. And so they're not ordinary people out there in the world. And I want to go, actually, scientists are ordinary people and we can be out there in the world and we do drink coffee and take the train and so on and so forth. And we meet ordinary people in the world just like we, we're ordinary people. And so you, you'll see, you will see pairings where that's helpful in order to get somewhere with the material. Um, in a longer version of this book, um, uh, you know, before I had to make decisions about the final content, there actually are more conversations between non-experts and, and, and I wanted the freedom to, uh, allow people to say things that actually aren't right as well, to make guesses about things or to extrapolate and wrong directions. But then what has to be much more careful about finding ways than of undoing that so that you're not getting people walking away from that story, uh, with, um, with, uh, with, with the wrong impressions. And, and there are some, there are some example as examples of that, but fewer of them made it to this book. But I will be revisiting that.

Speaker 8:          37:52          And I'm curious about your decision early on to decide to go straight to yourself and I'm wondering whether you could share some thoughts about the pros and cons of either doing the visual side yourself or partnering with someone, you know, have you thought about the disadvantages and what advice would you have to other academics and researchers who are interested in doing

Speaker 2:          38:14          that? That's, that's a great question. Um, uh,

Speaker 1:          38:19          great.

Speaker 2:          38:20          The decision Wa well,

Speaker 1:          38:24          okay.

Speaker 2:          38:25          Some of you may have a theoretical physics background. I have a, I don't know, but certainly in our field and maybe another in other sort of research areas like that where we're constantly, that process by which we go, my research is taking me into that direction and there's a whole bunch of techniques, um, uh, you know, new kinds of code or new kinds of mathematics or, or new kinds of physical ideas that I either need to teach myself or just invent in order to go off in that direction. So it's just sort of common to do that. So my first instinct always is, and it's the way I've always been since I was a kid, is just, just figure out what I need to go in that direction. So that was my first instinct. Um, and uh, uh, collaborating though is a wonderful thing. And, uh, one of the things I was concerned about, however, is that a, well, the two fold one is that there really wasn't anything else like this out there.

Speaker 2:          39:22          So trying to work with some, I, you know, I already, when I first tried to explain to people what it was I was trying to do, um, uh, I kept getting people, uh, you know, trying to make guesses what they thought were helpful, suggestions about what the book should be based on what people do. You know, what they already know. And, and I kept going, no, no, no, I don't want to do that. I don't want to do, I didn't want to do an adventure story. I don't want to do a biography. I don't want to do it. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And so at some point I just stopped telling people about it because they were trying to essentially infiltrate my idea with just making me do more of the same. Um, my worry then also is trying to get a professional artist, uh, on board is that I would also have that process whereby I'd be trying to explain to them that I wasn't trying to do this.

Speaker 2:          40:11          I wasn't trying to do that other thing. This is what I'm trying to do. And I just, I, and, and so there was this, this anticipation of the frustration of that process. I just thought, let me get least first, see whether I can just do it myself. Then there's also the issue of if I'm getting an artist that doesn't necessarily know any science, um, uh, I would then be spending a fair amount of time translating and, and some things may be lost in translation. They may do this beautiful page, but you know, the actual idea I was trying to, yeah. And then, and then also, I think you missed you. I would've had, I had I gone with an artist. I think I probably wouldn't have delved into researching how graphic novels work as much as I did and I wouldn't have discovered, you know, my equation, quote unquote, uh, the idea that there are opportunities in the structure of the medium itself to resonate with the physics ideas.

Speaker 2:          41:02          And, uh, I, I, I simply would not have come upon that and I think that was a value. So, um, so, uh, it certainly is not the only way of doing this. However, um, and I think, um, people are very welcome to, to, to, to try it in different ways, either doing the, doing the art themselves or, um, or working with a collaborator. There also are very good artists out there who also appreciate and love science and, and, uh, you know, really champing at the bit to do this kind of project, uh, with, with a physics collaborator. There's a actually a really good example. Um, um, the Phd Comics Guy Jorge Charm, uh, collaborated with Daniel Watson to do, it's not quite a graphic novel, but it's a, it's a prose book with lots of Fun Phd comic style illustrations and, and, and, and they're, you know, they both engage with the science in, in, in, in that project.

Speaker 2:          42:06          And so the collaborations like that, but there, there could also be very sort of, uh, um, writerly, sorry, a scientist is writer, artist type, uh, collaborations, um, uh, where, you know, you just, you just collaborate on trying to tell the story as best you can. So, um, I, I think all those, all those methods will produce interesting books and I think, um, we should try all of those things. I just think we've been, we've just for a field that's normally very, very innovative, which is physics, I think we've been really behind the curve on innovations in books, uh, for, for how we get people excited. So it's time to start trying all sorts of things. Um, some, uh, lots of concepts in equations and physics seem to lend themselves quite naturally to visual ways of explaining that. I think some are a really abstract and with, were there any that you kind of wanted to include in the book, but you're actually stumped and you thought, actually I just can't explain this in a simple way. Um, hmm. Yeah, I haven't, uh, I that certainly didn't happen in the process of, of, of doing the book I had.

Speaker 1:          43:21          Okay.

Speaker 2:          43:21          Maybe I, maybe I had already, uh, uh, preselected ideas that lend themselves well to being expressed visually when it, when I was sort of carving, um, uh, you know, carving out a chunk to put into the book. Um, since then I have been thinking about it. Um, I, I would like the opportunity perhaps to visit, um, uh, more deeply some ideas from quantum physics in this form. Um, usually what happens is you end up just drawing lots of fuzzy blobs and, you know, there's a, there's a, there's a point and then there's a fuzzy blob and what have you. And Quantum fuzziness, uh, gets used a lot, but not really exploiting that form very much. And I do wonder whether there are ways of doing it. So I, you know, let's see, maybe there'll be a volume to where I actually try and use the comic form full on two to address concepts in quantum physics. Um, we'll see. I actually to, uh, wanted

Speaker 9:          44:32          to come back a little bit more to your question with regard to the, the, the sort of status of the, of the, uh, interlocutors, uh, because, uh, not, not only I do, I think of them and hopefully present them as equals. Um, but I also show in many cases where the, the, the perhaps, uh, confident expert is, is, is, is, is tripped up by some of the questions. Uh, and, and, and, or maybe they push back on each other in ways so that there's a, for example, a conversation on the train where, um, where, uh, um, to, to, to people one, an expert at one, an astrophysicist and one whatever it is, they do, um, uh, start discussing the nature of time and it goes off an interesting philosophical directions and also, uh, directions do with, with a black hole physics and also directions to do with religion. And they really push against each other in interesting ways as, as equals, uh, coming from their own perspectives, uh, to that conversation. So, so, you know, I hope that's another example of it not being sort of master student. Yeah. Okay. Awesome. What do you want it to say? Whether you had made a decision to want fans of science, the expert? Well for someone who enjoys reading about the theories of silence or trained as working in the this area.

Speaker 2:          46:09          Um, uh, definitely, uh, it's meant to be a book that I hope one day to be, you know, on the pick of the design and just see a random person from a random field of a random age of a random background reading. I really, I really want to make it sort of for everybody. In fact, I had this battle, uh, you know, I could give you an entire talk about trying to get a book that's this unusual published, uh, because people want you to say very narrowly what group of, what demographic is this for. Uh, and, and, and I really pushed back against that. I think it should be possible to create books that offer everybody, not in some sort of vague sense, but in the very specific sense of, uh, we need to let go of the idea that you can open a book and necessarily, uh, uh, read it from cover to cover and get everything that first time.

Speaker 2:          47:06          Um, in fact, if you're writing a book about complex ideas that people have been researching on for hundreds of years, if, if, if someone can pick it up and, and read it just all in one, go and get everything, uh, maybe you're not trying hard enough because I think, I think difficult ideas should, uh, I mean difficult quote unquote cause difficult as a matter of perspective. Um, uh, should, uh, should lead you should leave you wanting more. You should be able to engage with it to some level and maybe not get everything and have the joy of coming back later and finding that you understand more or going, okay, that gave me a taste of, uh, what this idea is like. Um, and now I'll, uh, I'll, uh, I'll, I'll, I'll go do something else for a while, um, or have a sense of why it's important if I didn't get all the ideas. So what I'm trying to say is that, um, uh, I hope the book is, is an invitation to engage with these ideas. Um, not necessarily, um, all chapters will be for everybody. Um, there are some chapters that perhaps go into a little bit more technical detail then some other chapters. Um, but still none of those chapters are meant for experts. Um, uh, they, they really, they really are not.

Speaker 3:          48:29          Um, uh, yeah, uh, yeah,

Speaker 2:          48:34          uh, they really offer, you know, the lay person, um, uh, interested in science and there's a huge, um, uh, number of people out there who have a thirst for science ideas. Um, some of them will go to the section of the bookstore that says science and they'll go and pick up a book. And many of them, actually, most of them don't go to that section. They prefer to think of themselves maybe as visual people or however they, you know, whatever box they want to put themselves in. And they'll watch a documentary on TV or something like that, but they won't pick up

Speaker 3:          49:08          no

Speaker 2:          49:10          Roger Penrose or, uh, you know, um, frank wheelchair or any of these really interesting writers engaging with science, uh, through through book form. Um, hopefully, uh, this book is, is, is a way that might get them to get excited. They're also people who might pick it up thinking it's a graphic novel and it is a graphic novel and find, Oh, science is actually kind of interesting. Um, what I did is at the end of every chapter, I have lots of suggestions for further reading, so I will send them to find out more in Roger Penrose or frank wheelchair or you know, any of the other really great writers out there who are thinking about things, uh, in prose form that presenting things in prose form and um, but they might get a taste of the beginning of the ideas first, um, uh, in, um, in, in the book. So I don't know if that answers the question is sort of a long rambling answer, but I think it's a, it's a complex issue.

Speaker 3:          50:06          Yes.

Speaker 9:          50:12          I think, I think you might've claim, yeah. Where did you kind of see the book sitting in, in the big stuff, even that it's fictional content within a fictional setting. Yeah. And how you would avoid kind of confusion with that. This, um,

Speaker 2:          50:28          this has caused me a set many and continues to cause me many. Uh, I was nights I've lost sleep because I, that I, that point I lose control because now it's all about the publisher and the bookstores, but actually more the bookstores than anything else. And the problem is that, um, people will pick up the book and they're trying to decide what shelf to put it on. And despite the fact that I keep screaming, it's a nonfiction book about science. And first and foremost, that's the section it belongs in. But it's very hard to go into one of these bookstores and find it there. Um, uh, because I think people will just go, oh, it's got pictures. It's the children's book. So I actually just the other day had to politely ask for someone to move it from the children's book section to the science book sections.

Speaker 2:          51:20          Right. Right. Over there. And, uh, and then, and then, or it might be in the graphic book section and the graphic novel section, which, which I'm happy with too. Um, uh, I would like it ideally to be in all of those sections. Now, of course, bookstores only have limited shelf space, so that's a hard sell. Um, uh, so, um, I, I would really love to see it, to answer your question directly, my fantasy about where it should be is on those tables in the middle, um, where people can stumble on it and, and, and see that it, it, it, it, it both doesn't, doesn't fit in any of those sections. And I, I really think they should be more room for books that are hard to classify. Unfortunately. And this, the way things are set up now is something is hard to classify. It disappears because people get confused and there's just too much effort.

Speaker 2:          52:14          So let's not even worry. So, so that's the thing. I'm, I'm, I'm fighting most, uh, um, uh, uh, right now I'm at the stage of the book's out. It's also difficult to get it, uh, um, sort of talked about by the usual outlets because, you know, a publication for example, goes, well, this our graphic novel people should talk about that. It's the comic book and the Comic Book People Go, but there was no superheroes or it's, you know, not a tortured memoir. So, or it's got too much science in it. And so it ends up, again, getting, getting lost. So it, it's, it's, it's one of the frustrations. So I'm hoping that in this world where a word of mouth has a lot more power through social media and things like that, that I can combat some of that classification problem by just having people talk about it and go, hey, I really enjoy this. I don't care what section it goes in. Uh, I enjoyed reading it, so that's, that's the hope. So please talk about it. Uh, yeah.

Speaker 10:         53:15          So you both mentioned in the introduction that you consulted on superhero movies and I was wondering about that just a fun thing for you should do, or was it another way to try engage people with science and how do you reconcile like, having real science and also in the context of those movies? I mean, like fantasy, divine magic sign habits. So both,

Speaker 2:          53:39          right. Yeah. Um, so to the first part of your question, um, um, I think of it as real work. Uh, it's one of the problems I have, uh, doing this kind of work, putting serious hours into science advising for the entertainment industry. Um, people assume I'm just sort of goofing off with my Hollywood buddies. Um, and, and don't realize that it takes a huge amount of work, uh, to, to, you know, to do it in a, in a useful, um, uh, impactful way. Um, uh, and it varies from project to project. Sometimes it's a conversation. Other Times I'm reading, uh, you know, uh, for example, for the, I know if you saw that show, um, uh, about Einstein's life and work last year called genius, um, you know, with that I was teaching them a lot of the science. I was helping them select aspects of the science that could be used to illustrate Einstein's life.

Speaker 2:          54:39          And I was, I was giving a detailed notes on every hour long script, uh, and, uh, you know, doing a lot of back and forth. That's a lot of time. Um, why do I do it? Because I think it's incredibly an incredibly powerful medium. It's where, uh, you know, whatever age group you're talking about, whether it be adults or children or what have you, that's where the eyeballs are. Um, uh, as, as soon as they leave the classroom or as soon as people leave work, they're going to entertainment. So why wouldn't we be there if we, if we really care about science being part of our every day, uh, engagement. So for me, I think, um, uh, that's a marvelous space to be involved in when I get the opportunity, uh, to get people excited about science. Now. Uh, so I do both fiction and nonfiction, uh, projects when I can.

Speaker 2:          55:33          And I, I think they're equally important. Again, there's a whole bunch of people will, who will go and watch a thing about Einstein or who will watch a documentary about, you know, the nature of time and what have you. And so sure, I put a lot of effort into, into, into those as well. But there's a whole bunch of people who potentially can be engaged by science who will never go and see those things on those channels. But they'll go and see the latest movie about Thor or the Avengers or what have you. And if I can sneak some ideas in there, uh, that can have benefit to it might be a lot fewer science ideas, but it's millions more people. So you never know where it might, where it might have some value. Now I should take a step and ask about this whole business is sneaking some science in because it isn't that I'm sort of putting spinach into your milkshake.

Speaker 2:          56:29          As I, as I, as I, uh, as I like to say, I'm sure of showing, hoping to show that, um, there's all kinds of flavors of milkshake that people haven't, uh, um, uh, engaged with, uh, that, that could be really awesome. And, um, the, the core point there are, when I talk with filmmakers who don't care about the mission, perhaps some do, but really it isn't their main motivation to care about the mission of science education. But I can help them tell more interesting stories and that gets people buying more tickets. So if, if you, uh, reasonably, uh, uh, uh, uh, well, sort of cognizant people about how, how the universe works, go into a movie and you can see they've done a sloppy job of making the whole story believable because the world building is problematic, um, it pops you out of the movie.

Speaker 2:          57:23          You, you're probably not going to go see it three times. Like, you know, like, like you, you, you, you may, uh, if, if, if you really sort of engaged with it. So even though they might be people with magic flying hammers and you know, doing all sorts of crazy things, if it has the feeling of, of, of a, of at least for the two hours that you're in the movie of, of feeling like it's a scientifically coherent world, even though it's not our world, um, then, uh, you're telling a better story and, and uh, and who better to ask about how to build universes and rules for universes than people who study this universe and study its rules. So, so, so that, that's, that's sort of the, the job I think I can, I can do if they let me, unfortunately, most of Hollywood still hasn't realized that last part. Um, so it's still fairly random as to how much they let me, uh, get involved in those projects. But when they do, I can usually give them some fun stuff.
