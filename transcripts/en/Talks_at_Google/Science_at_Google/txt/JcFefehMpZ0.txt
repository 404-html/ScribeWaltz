Speaker 1:          00:06          [inaudible].

Speaker 2:          00:10          Hi everybody. I guess my job is to ask you how you're feeling. Um, you think I'm kidding. I have to just say before I start that I did not create the title for my presentation. I have to put the onus there and Danielle, I would probably get fired from this presentation title. I'm just kidding. Um, so I want to start off with a quote can ask everyone to get some like maybe good posture in your seats, some of your like, take a nice inhale, maybe just get settled and just think about how this quote resonates with you. And I'll just read it. No one cares how much you know until they know how much you care. What do we think?

Speaker 1:          01:03          Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:04          Does that resonate with you at all or are you thinking, well, I'm pretty smart, right? My students at Y'all say that a lot. Like what do you mean nobody cares how much, you know, I know everything. I'm like, well, maybe about some things, probably not about how to interact very well. But, um, and you know, my work is primarily in education. So I work with school systems to help bring the principles of emotional intelligence into what I call the immune system of the way the school operates, from how leaders lead to how teachers teach, to how students learn to help parents parent. And what I've learned over the years is that this quote really is the truth for the way education works. As a 47 year old psychologist, professor, um, I went back to the middle school that I attended about five years ago, after 33 years ago, a bullying.

Speaker 2:          01:54          Uh, it was a pretty horrifically bullied kid. And, um, when I went back to my school, I had no memories of anything I learned. I had no memories of, of my even many of my peers. Uh, I couldn't remember any teachers name, but I remember how I felt walking in that hallway, like the terror and the fear. Um, and I remember thinking, why didn't anybody ever asked me how I felt? Why didn't anyone ever attend to my feelings? Um, hence now I spend my whole life running around the world, getting everybody to talk about their feelings. Um, so one tool that we developed to help people become aware of feelings just to the basic level is called the mood meter. So I'm going to teach you a little bit about this right now. All of you got some email or whatever. Notice you got here at Google about a presentation on emotional intelligence and you're here now, which is wonderful.

Speaker 2:          02:43          Um, so my question for you is how are you feeling right now not about life minus five would be you're having thoughts, something like, really, I have to listen to this guy for a whole hour. Like that's, that's what we do now. Google, we have people come talk about feelings. Maybe you're there, maybe you're at minus three and pleasantness. You're having thoughts or something like, yeah, whatever maybe or neutral. I live in Connecticut now. I feel like that's the state of our entire state, right? We're like the neutral state. Um, not a lot of emotion. Maybe you're a plus three. You're thinking to yourself, my goodness, I get to sit in a room with a guy from Connecticut that who's going to talk about feelings, uh, are maybe or a plus five. Like there are no words in the English language dictionary, right to describe the feeling you're having right now. So please give yourself a number from minus five to plus five in terms of your current level of pleasantness. And the y axis is his energy. So energy has to do literally with how much activation you have going on, plus five [inaudible]. You're so activated, you just can't contain yourself. Minus five is you're in your deepest pool of despair.

Speaker 2:          04:03          Minus five. Do you feel like you're being pulled into the ground? Plus five is you are just so highly energized. You can't contain your body. Where's your energy right now? Obviously we create our mood meter from these two axes. So we've got yellow, red, blue, and green. Let me just see where you are. How many of you are feeling yellow right now? High Energy and pleasant. Okay, that's impressive. Um, how many of you are green? You're a pleasant, but your energy's kind of low. How many of you are in the blue or red today?

Speaker 1:          04:38          Okay,

Speaker 2:          04:40          the three people sitting in the back row. Okay, Alicia got good distance from me. That's good. Um, now the question is, are we being authentic and honest right now? Is it true that 85 to 90% of the room is actually feeling quote unquote yellow and green? Highly doubtful. I mean maybe life here. Is that amazing? I live in Connecticut or the East Coast is not known for its yellow and green feelings. Um, what I want you to do right now is take about three seconds and convert your quadrant to a word. Take three seconds please. What is the word that best describes your current feeling? All right. Freeze. Gimme an honest raise of hands. How many of you had some trouble finding the precise word? Hands up high. Like really high? Please look around the room. Everybody.

Speaker 1:          05:36          Okay,

Speaker 2:          05:37          so it's interesting. I mean at least it is Timmy. Here we are our room filled with highly educated people who are emotionally illiterate. Okay. Now I'd be like, I don't like this guy already. I want to ask you for, take a second. What are your hypotheses around that? What do you think? Why would it be, I mean, truthfully, you're all highly educated people. Why would you not be able to find a word to describe how you're failing? Yes.

Speaker 3:          06:05          There's many feelings happening at the same time. Like how many? Like 14.

Speaker 2:          06:12          Okay. Well we have treatment for that. Alright. You're right though. You could have, you feel you may be filling more than one emotion. 14 is a lot, but I'll, I'll, yeah.

Speaker 3:          06:26          I think that the way that our success is structure rewards us for divorcing, um, intelligence and strategy from our emotions.

Speaker 2:          06:33          Okay. So like we're in a society that just has like put the feelings aside. So maybe you haven't developed your vocabulary for it because you're having attended to it. Any other hypotheses?

Speaker 3:          06:44          Yeah, it's a natural resistance to collapsing the complexity of your internal state. We'll color.

Speaker 2:          06:51          Uh Huh. So there's this repeat that please.

Speaker 3:          06:58          Natural resistance to collapsing the complexity to what?

Speaker 2:          07:04          All right. So maybe it's like we're just way too dynamic to put ourselves into one quadrant or one feeling word. Very point. Yeah. Last one.

Speaker 3:          07:17          Yup.

Speaker 2:          07:21          Yup. So maybe around how your focus, what your, where your focus is, right? If I asked you how you feeling in life, that's a very big question. If I ask you how you're feeling about attending a talk on emotional intelligence, it might help you be more precise potentially. Now. All right. All of you are here for an hour. That's the time of the presentation. How many of you will have some trouble staying focused for a whole hour? Raise your hand. Okay, wonderful. Great. I have a room filled with attention deficit disorder. Um, just what I hope for in life. Um, so I'm going to give you an ideal spot to be. I would like you to be around plus one plus one for my presentation. I'm going to set an emotion goal for you. I'm going to call that the spot of joyful effort. And what I'd like you to do is think about where you are in reference to that point and what strategy my best serve you to kind of stay there for the next 45 minutes. What strategy will best serve you? Who feels they have a an effective strategy? No one. I'll be back. Yeah, just being relaxed. Just being relaxed.

Speaker 3:          08:43          Challenging things. That speaker says,

Speaker 2:          08:49          I want the critical person in the road. Like I don't like what I just said. I want to argue that one. Yeah. Let

Speaker 3:          08:54          me, if you can see how it

Speaker 2:          08:56          helps you a lot in life even becoming just to the old state. So I'll make it relevant to your life.

Speaker 3:          09:01          She goes to the opposite of his, which was being receptive.

Speaker 2:          09:05          Thank you. Thank you. Take it outside. Yeah. All right, so one is going to be more critical. You're going to be open, you're going to be relaxed to, you are going to make it relevant to your life. You're going to just focus. Yeah. Keeping it. Yes sir.

Speaker 3:          09:21          To be be present.

Speaker 2:          09:25          Yeah. They want to be present. All right. So let's take this into the real world because this is definitely not the real world. And let's imagine now I am what I do a lot. I go into Middle School here in Palo Alto and I walk in and say, when everybody, my name is mark, I'm going to be your teacher today and I know, uh, your teacher loved me, the script, we're going to be doing their Roman oligarchy today. Okay? So what I want you to do, I know that my goal is for you to be in that kind of low yellow. And here's, I'm going to just offer you some strategies, just, just chill. Just relax and be here, okay? I need you to make this relevant to your life. If that doesn't work, just be open. And what I really want you to do is it's just focus, right? There is no past. We know the future is like whatever. So just be here with me now. Be here in the present moment. All right? Ready to go? What do you think? How effective are those strategies?

Speaker 2:          10:39          So I want you to just take a moment and think about it. Well those strategies work. How many of you ever asked someone to calm down? All right. And how many of you in the hyster asking someone to calm down and have found that it really works, right? Like with your partner? Like honey, I love you but like I just need you to calm down. All right, what? I want to make someone mad. That's what I say. Say. There you go. So telling us that one to strategize is complex. Anything else that you see wrong with those strategies or potentially right? Yeah.

Speaker 3:          11:14          Well you're putting the onus of us being attentive on us and not one, both of us.

Speaker 2:          11:20          Oh good point. You actually bring up a really good point, which is that emotions are not necessarily always self regulated, right? That we are in relationship and they are co-regulating think about that, right? Whether it's a device that you're in the room with or whether it's a human being, right? You're in a co-regulation process because how I present the facial expressions, body language, vocal tones, the way I present myself will influence. And be contagious. I many ways to your feelings, which will then in turn come back to me. So we're in this dynamic reciprocal relationship right now, whether we're conscious of it or not. So as your teacher right now, I am influencing how you're feeling, which is a form of self regulation or co-regulation. Other points. Yeah. So you're getting to the specificity, right? You can't just say be present or be focused or become like what do you do to become, what do you do to be present? Everyone here just said that they're going to have attention problems. So what is the actual mental strategy that you're engaging in? To manage the feeling or to create the feeling.

Speaker 1:          12:35          Okay.

Speaker 2:          12:36          Alright, everyone, sit up straight in your seats for a moment. Please take a nice long inhale and I exhale. And if you're comfortable, close your eyes. If not, not a problem. It's five o'clock in the morning, you're probably waste leap. It's six maybe or seven o'clock in the morning. You wake up. How do you feel? This is internal talk right now as you wake up each morning, typical day, how do you feel?

Speaker 1:          13:07          Okay.

Speaker 2:          13:08          It's breakfast time. Are you eating breakfast at home or are you waiting to get to work or you're having a good cup of coffee? A bad cup of coffee. How do you feel when you do your morning routine? All right. You're on your way to work. Traffic. No traffic, public transportation. How do you feel?

Speaker 1:          13:26          Okay.

Speaker 2:          13:26          What are you doing on your way to work? Texting like you shouldn't be phone calls. Radio. All right. You arrive at work, you walk around. How do you feel meeting one, meeting two meaning three mini four meaning five meaning six meetings, seven, 28 million, 9 million. 10. Take yourself through those meetings. Emails, no emails. Phone calls, no phone calls. The text, no texts. How do you feel? Lunchtime. Healthy. Unhealthy, relaxed. Stressful. I use chewing. Or are you just swallowing? How do you feel at lunch? Who are you with? Are you alone or with others? Is it enjoyable or are you under pressure? Okay, it's after lunch. More meetings, more emails, more meetings, more emails, distractions. How are you feeling in the afternoon? All right, you're leaving work. What time is it and where are you going? Exercise. No exercise. Oh, no. Time for exercise. Kids. No kids, partner, no partner. Family, no family with the afternoon like, and how are you feeling? Are you get home? Who is there? Are you alone or with other people? What's your evening like? You're watching America's got talent or not reading, not reading. What's your evening like and how are you feeling most evenings? All right, it's time to go to bed. What's your evening routine like? What are you thinking about as you put yourself to sleep?

Speaker 2:          15:09          Raise your hand if you think you had a couple hundred emotions throughout the day.

Speaker 2:          15:17          We should all raise your hand because you probably had a couple of thousand. Uh, we tend to experience around three to five emotions in a minute in some instances. Um, how many of you saw us? But I won't ask you to raise your hands, but if I were to ask you to kind of plot yourself back on that mood meter, do you see yourself kind of living in one quadrant more throughout the day? Do you see yourself going throughout different quadrants? Like yellow in the morning and then blow it the meeting. And then red here and then green here and then yellow here. So I've been really interested as a researcher as to what are or what is the emotional life of our nation. And I've done three large studies over the last couple of years. Uh, the first one was a study with 45,000 high school students across the nation. And this isn't collaboration, uh, with the pop singer, Lady Gaga and her foundation born this way, foundation and what we did a with funding from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, we coin across United States and we looked at the state of emotional fair. So I asked you to think about your feelings first. Now let's think about our nation's youth top three feelings that you believe our nation's high school is public, private and charter are feeling. What do you think? Confused. Stressed. Fear. Insecure. Depressed. If I'm going to ask you to think about, look at it. We got one optimist in the room. If you were to take the whole pie of 100% what percent are positive and emotions is what percent of negative emotions? What do you think?

Speaker 1:          16:53          Nine,

Speaker 2:          16:56          two thirds negative. All right, well here are the results. By 75% were negative. Top three feelings. We're tired, board and stressed and went a little deeper. And what we did was we looked at all right, what percentage of the time are these kids experiencing these emotions? We found that they say they're stressed 80% of the time stressed, uh, 80% of the time board 70% of the time. So I want you to think about like what's happening if you want to think about innovation and creativity, right? What happens if you're in an environment where you're feeling tired, board and stressed, Hungover, Warren's drafts, tired, worn, rest, high board and stressed. Now as a professor at a pretty prestigious place, I was curious like what's the state of emotional affairs of the brightest crayons in the box? So I did a study last year with undergrads and here is the state of affairs at Yale.

Speaker 2:          17:58          It looks a little similar, doesn't it? Stress, number one, overwhelmed, anxious, frustrated. There some excitement, uh, which is good, but about 70% of the emotions they're experiencing. And then I went and I said, I'm really interested in teachers, which is my primary area. I said, what does the state of of affairs of America's educators, frustrated, stressed, overwhelmed, some happiness and joyful. But if you look at the, all the little words, most of them are not the most pleasant words. And then with funding from another foundation, I decided to look at 25,000 people across the entire workforce. And here's what people across the United States feel. I work. Stress is the number one feeling. Some other ones too, a little bit of motivation, busy, tired, engaged. And what we know from our work, right is that there's the good stress and bad stress. I actually like to hire people who experience some stress.

Speaker 2:          18:58          I like people have slight anxiety problems or they get stuck, they get stuff done. Um, that's good stress. Unfortunately, when we do the more detailed analysis of what's happening, we find that it's most of the bad stress that people are feeling. The stress that makes them not want to go to work. This stress that makes him not really be present at work, that's just, that makes them feel physically sick. Now, for most of my career, I've been fighting people in terms of caring about emotions. Just for your, uh, my own curiosity for people here at Google. How many of you believe that these feelings that you just saw from tired board and stressed to stressed, overwhelmed and anxious to frustrated, stressed and overwhelmed, distressed matter

Speaker 2:          19:49          and matter for important things about a person's life? So what I've learned in my research is that emotions matter for five big reasons. The first of the attention, memory learning. So how you're feeling right now in my presentation is driving your presence, your focus, your engagement, your critical analysis. If you're a board, you're already somewhere else. You're already working on your project. If you're frustrated, you're back there thinking, oh my God, what am I going to do? If you're stressed, you're thinking, how do we get out of here? So I think back now, 33 years ago when I was in middle school and being bullied. And why? I have no memory of anything that I learned. It was because why? Because my brain with preoccupied with survival, right? My brain was preoccupied with friendships, the need for friendships. So why would I want to be in a classroom?

Speaker 2:          20:47          Why would I even care about learning about the Roman oligarchy when I'm afraid to walk home or when I'm not having positive relationships? The second is decision making. I'm just curious if any of you ever made a bad decision. Anyone like to just share publicly right now to just let it out so we know that how we feel shifts the way we make choices and decisions. I'll give you one example. So in my work with schools, I did a random experiment where I took educators. Let's imagine you're all teachers and I just randomly assign you think about a day. That was great. Think about a day that was shitty. Great Day, Shitty Day, great day, Shitty Day. It's been five minutes just writing about it. And then immediately thereafter I gave every single educator in that study the same essay to read. Does anyone think there were differences in the grades?

Speaker 2:          21:42          They assigned, there was a one to two full grade difference and the way the teachers on a greater these students, right? Just five minute little essay or writing assignment about good day, bad day, and then they graded the paper and there were one to two full grade on average difference. I kind of knew it was going to happen cause I know how emotions influence thinking. I think what interested me most was at the end of the study I said, do you believe that how you felt influence the way you evaluated the essay? What percentage of the educators do you said, yeah, of course.

Speaker 2:          22:21          Right about 90% denied it. They said there's no way that how I felt what an influence the way evaluated that essay. And I think what that tells us is a lot. I think the primary thing is that our emotions are influencing and biasing the way we're seeing the world and the choices that we're making, but it's happening outside of our conscious awareness. The third is relationship quality. Just curious, does anyone here have a colleague did not look to your left or your right? Uh, or a relative who displays a lot of negative emotion. Someone who maybe walks around like this, does anybody know something like that? Or they're very disagreeable. I don't like that idea. Why you want to do it that way? Um, where I work, I get things like this perfect bracket. I've got a question.

Speaker 2:          23:19          I'm not really sure you know the answer. Okay? Not a problem. A lot of problem. Can't wait to grade your freaking paper. And so we know that emotions are signals and they tell us to approach our to avoid. So when we think about people and we think about products, right? How they make us feel makes want to move toward them or against, does that resonate with everyone? So that, and that's a basic thing around survival, right? We don't approach the angering expression because we got to protect ourselves from it. We don't want to approach people who make us feel bored, right? Because we know we're just not going to want to be in relationship with them. People who display more positive emotions or who are more gentle in their expressions, right? They're saying, I'm here for you. Right? If I walk around like this and I might talk right?

Speaker 2:          24:18          Immediately you're thinking, oh, this guy's not approachable. You know, I'm not. You've got power issues. He's got control issues. The fourth is physical and mental health. So it's interesting. I was in a meeting last week, two weeks ago now I'm with a group of the counselors from universities around the state of Connecticut. And what the research now shows is that for the last five years, there has been a 20% increase in psychiatric hospitalizations for undergraduates. So it's kind of 20% a year for the last five years with the research. My own shows is that if we took the indicators of stress for adolescents and teenagers in our nation, they are greater than the stress levels of the adults who are raising them. So you can imagine what's going on in our nation right now when everyone is having this high activation emotion, right? Cortisol being released, confusion happening, and ability to concentrate. Lots of other things. The final piece is on creativity. Now, Google is not really known for that, right? Um, how many of you believe that creativity is important?

Speaker 2:          25:29          Good. Um, that's good news. Um, one thing interesting that we have found is that in our studies of young adults that how they feel and their emotion skills is highly correlated with their ability to be creative. Well, we know from research is that cognitive ability correlates with creativity but only up to an average Iq level. So most people think that creativity is a cognitive process, right? That the more high, the higher your Iq is, the more creative you are. What happens with cognitive abilities that it does this. So the question is what's explaining the rest of the variance in creativity? And what we're finding is that it has to be emotion skills. Any hypotheses of why that might be the case? Why would it emotion skills be responsible for the creative process and product?

Speaker 2:          26:31          Great Point. So if you're under pressure, pressure, pressure all the time and your kind of default network is never able to kind of be activated, right? How can you be creative? What else? Awareness of how the thing that you're creating is affecting you or you and the people who are going to buy it. So putting emotion into the product as well as imagining what the feelings are, the recipient of that product. What else you're afraid of failing. You probably not going to go very far. It's a great point. Now, how many of you've heard of this concept called grit? Yup. So what we find in our research is that grit is not correlated with creativity or academic achievement, but that the skills of emotion management are, and I think the reason for that is that has anyone here ever, how many of you have actually attempted to be creative and have failed that an attempt? Yeah. Um, how many of you have ever gotten negative feedback?

Speaker 2:          27:33          How many of you ever been frustrated with your own design of something? Have you ever been disappointed in your own work? So emotions are inherent in everything we do. And some people, they, boy, you just got to plow through it, but not really the case, right? The more the wider base our strategies are, the more effective we're going to be. So how do you manage the disappointment? How do you manage the frustration? How do you manage being overwhelmed? How do you manage the feedback? I mean, I get feedback all the time. I was doing this presentation in New York recently as given one guy looks at me, he's like, you know, I know like this stuff. And I was like, well, I don't like you. So like not a problem. We don't have to work together. I gave a talk recently at my own university to the surgeons in one department and right after my presentation was over to sergeant stands up and I'm waiting for him to like compliment me and he's like, what has happened to Yale?

Speaker 2:          28:33          I was like, wow, like that's, I was like, okay, keep going. And then he goes, this is, yeah, we're about producing Nobel laureates, not nice people. I was like, you've got to be kidding me. And then I said, does anybody else feel any different? Of course it got worse as the other guy, he raised his hand, he goes, I've learned in my work. Sometimes you gotta be an asshole. Then people just shut up and do what you tell them to do. And I looked over at the chair of the, this big department. I'm like, I might, it's just like a movie being made right now. Like where the hell am I? So in life when we're trying to be creative, we're trying to do the things that we think are important. There's going to be a million people that are going to get in the way.

Speaker 2:          29:22          Um, you know, and the question is, do we have the strategies to persevere and do we have the strategies to manage the difficult emotions that come up for us as we're trying to create something. So that leads us to this whole model of like, what do you do about it? And what I've learned is that if you want to do great work in terms of this idea of emotional intelligence, first we've got to get people on the bus. Like, do you believe that emotions matter? And I'm not sure we're in a nation that believes that how people feel matters. I think that we're a couple of hundred years behind unfortunately. And you see that all the time. Like I had a student last semester because like, so now you're asking me to put, plop myself on your mood meter. On my to do list. I'm like, yeah, actually if you want to take my class, guess what?

Speaker 2:          30:13          You're going to be checking in with your feelings pretty regularly. And there's so much resistance to this idea of like infusion of emotion, right? So step one I think is mindset. What I've learned also is that if you're trying to do good work, you really can't just train one person or in schools like the third grade teacher is going to do this in their classroom. It doesn't make any sense. It's got to be infused into the system so that it changes the DNA in many ways. But it's not just about the skills, it's about the climate. So you can put the, you know, someone with skills into a toxic environment, but then they have no opportunity to express those skills. So in my research, what we're finding is that when you simultaneously focus on the skill building and also creating a more healthy emotional climate, you get great outcomes. All right? So that means we've got to first develop the skills are they get to take a moment and think of someone who you know, who is emotionally wise that anyone know someone who you would say is like the personification of emotional intelligence. What are those skills? What do you think? Just let's hear real quickly, what are, what do you think are the skills of the emotionally intelligent person? Yeah, they're a good listener. All right. What else? Attentive. Empathy. Curious, calm. There was no experience. Personal experience, state control, state control, time. Further response, sense of humor. Said again, equanimity, suspending judgment, not impulsive. Anything else come up. Then a stand themselves. So can we get more granular than that?

Speaker 2:          32:18          He really, what are the skills, the underlying abilities of the emotion and Delta was it'd be a good listener to being good and to be empathic, right? Those are in many ways outcomes. What are the underlying skills? Well, because of the time, I'll just tell you them. So we call those skills emotional intelligence and there are five basic skills. The first is recognizing emotion. A second is understanding. The third is labeling. That fourth is expressing and the fifth is regulating. So let's jump through them. Thank you. Which is the name of my model. This guy's good. Recognizing emotion, so we understand emotion through identifying thoughts and feelings through paying attention to other people's facial expressions, body language, vocal tone. Now it's interesting. Not all emotion concepts are emotions per se. So let's try the vocal tone one. That's a nice one. I had a stressful time, just so you know, getting here for, I was in Mexico doing your presentation. It was a little frustrating. Getting here could use a little compassion. So I like to see if Googlers can generate the sound of compassion on the count of one, three, two, one.

Speaker 2:          33:43          I don't think that was universal. Just say that was like four of you. All right, let's try it again. On the count of one, the side of compassion. Three, two, one. Hi. That was pretty good, right? All right, now let's here. Let's say you're like, I can't stand this guy. I am disgusted. And the count of one discussed three, two, one. Now you're like, oh my goodness. This is like, I've never seen anything like this. You are in awe. Three, two, one. That's pretty good. Now you are feeling deep love for me. Like just the love that you just, there are no words for your love on the count of one. The sound of love. Three, two, one. All right, so that was different. Was it that you were able to have pretty good tone for compassion and awe and discuss, but love was a little off. You don't feel it that off. All right, well we'll work on that. Anyone else? What do you think? I'm sorry. It's a more complex emotion. It's a private emotion. So there are private and public emotions you think? All right.

Speaker 3:          35:09          Well some of the other ones you mentioned were more instantaneous, so there's a direct reaction concern, but love is not an immediate reaction to the last thing you said. It's, it has duration time.

Speaker 2:          35:22          So the question, yeah, let's try another one. Let's imagine that you're looking at me like I want this guy to come live with me. You are feeling desire, like you've never felt that before before. On the count of one, the sound of desire? Three, two, one. All right, well at least it makes me feel a little better. It's the only way I get it nowadays, right? I got to like ask for it. Um, that was maybe too much information. But anyway, the, so love maybe is more of a feeling, not an emotion, whereas surprise is an automatic response to a stimulus that causes a shift in our behavior and our physiology and our cognition where love is more complex. It's more of a feeling. But desire is more like an emotion because there's an automatic response to a stimulus. So it helps us get this language for emotion, right? Is it a mood? Is it a feeling, is an emotion? And we want to recognize all of the above. The second is understanding of motion. Why am I having these feelings? Where are they coming from? How is what I'm feeling influencing my thinking, my judgments and behavior? So here's an easy one for all of you. I'm going to ask you to differentiate to emotions. How many of you've heard of the word anger and disappointment?

Speaker 3:          36:49          Good.

Speaker 2:          36:51          I want to know from you. You've got 30 seconds. Make it 20 now to differentiate the two, what is the actual difference and what makes someone feel angry as opposed to disappointment? Who feels they've got it? We have one confident person. All right, I'm going to go with you in the back. What does that mean? Okay, so you're talking about the energy factor. I want to further push that to say what's the underlying difference in the causal pieces of it? What makes you go to anger versus disappointment?

Speaker 3:          37:29          How about you? Okay, back there and anger.

Speaker 2:          37:40          Okay. You just get any of it. Everything I can get anywhere at the drop of anything. Yes.

Speaker 3:          37:45          Anger as a physiological response. Wash of adrenaline. All right.

Speaker 2:          37:50          Uh, I've called a nearby I once, someone over there, what do we think? Let's stop the presentation now. How many of you are walking out of here thinking, I got the difference? It's interesting, isn't it? Like these are two words that we use all the time, but yet when we try to get to the granularity of understanding, there are differences. It becomes more complex. So disappointment has to do with unmet expectations, right? I thought it was going to work this way. I thought I was going to get the AA. I just, everything was legit though and I just didn't, didn't make it. Anger tends to have a theme of injustice or unfairness. Right? That was not fair. How could you say, how could you do that? How many of you believe that there are people who are feeling disappointment but expressing it in a way that looks like anger?

Speaker 2:          38:44          What do you think happens all the time. I was one of those kids, so I went to karate to become like this tough guy. As you can see, it worked really well. And um, I came home and I, cause I failed my yellow belt test. I was like devastated. I mean it was like really not in a good place. Come home. I look at my car, I hate you. How could you maybe go to karate? I hate you. I'm never going to karate. I'm not even going to call tomorrow. Uh, and my parents did what they knew how to do. My mother says, you can't talk to me that way. Go to your room, wait till your father gets home. Great father gets home. I thought I told you never to talk to your mother that way. You know mark for crying out loud. I've had it right. Not once did anyone say so like what happened?

Speaker 2:          39:30          Like how you feeling sad and so I got punished for being aggressive but no one actually knew how I was feeling now. It could have been like it looked like I was angry. It could have been one of a million stories. One I didn't just do, I just didn't do all the test too is the bull. He said to me, we knew where you're going to pass the test. We're going to get you tomorrow morning on the way to school. I mean a million things could be underneath the behavior and what happens in our world is that we work or we spend way too much time judging behavior and attributing emotions to the behavior as opposed to really understanding what the feeling and emotion is, which is why we need vocabulary. We say we have to name it to tame it because if I'm disappointed, how you support me will be very different than if I'm angry.

Speaker 2:          40:22          Which leads to our rules around expressing emotion, the context, is it appropriate, is it inappropriate and many things influence that. Your personality influences it, your cultural background, your race, your agenda, your own upbringing. So I have two older brothers who are great guys and they don't really know what to do. They're 11 and eight years older than I am, so by the time I was like seven or eight they were out of the house. We have close friends now, but they convinced that basically what mark does is he makes money by thinking in coffee shops and I was like, I actually have a real career guys. Like I write papers I teach. So I said, come on to hear me speak. And they came to New York to one of my presentations. First 15 minutes. It was like really cool. Like my two older brothers they were looking at, that's my brother. About 20 minutes in. All of a sudden I see my one brother looking at by the religious, like really not in a good place. And I realized afterwards that it was at the point where I was saying I've been bullied. It was up to the point I was talking about my neurotic mother and my angry father and my two brothers.

Speaker 2:          41:39          And so at the end of my talk, I want us to my brother, I'm like, so guys, we have my brother's. He was like, really pass. He's like, don't even walk out with me. I'm like, are you serious? He's like, you share way too much. You're too vulnerable. I'm like, Dave, like I'm the director of the center emotional intelligence. Like if I can't talk about my feelings, no one's going to tell you about their failings. And he's like, and I, you know, and, and he went on and on. Then the last thing he said was something like, and you know what?

Speaker 1:          42:07          Okay,

Speaker 2:          42:08          people are going to see you as being weak. Which is fascinating to me that because I share so much about being a victim of bullying and how I had all these challenges growing up and my parents were this way that that was going to make people see me as weak. Right? I remember looking at my one brother, I'm like, Dave, like I don't know. In my department we call that projection, right? Like I'm doing okay. Just let you know I'm doing all right. Um, but it shows me, right that we all have our rules.

Speaker 1:          42:38          Okay,

Speaker 2:          42:38          don't we? We have rules about emotion. Do I talk about them too? I talk about them. Am I a hugger? I'm not a hugger. Do I give good eye contact? Am I not give eye contact? Is it cultural cause it is cultural. There's no doubt about it. That was a cultural,

Speaker 2:          42:54          which leads us to the last skill of emotional intelligence, which is the big one, which is emotion regulation, right? What are the strategies that I have available to me to manage it all? Emotions to not just downregulate the negative ones, but the upgrade, like the ones that I need to achieve a goal. So, for example, if you were here and you said, well, I'm in the blue when I asked you to be in the yellow, what's your strategy for shifting into that place? Yeah, that's an upregulating strategy. Most people's conceptions of emotion regulation is that it's regulating down. What we're saying is that it's about preventing unwanted emotions, reducing difficult emotions, initiating ones that you want to have, maintaining emotions that are useful to you, that you're experiencing and even boosting or enhancing emotions. And it's interesting, like right now, if I'm stressed out, like let's say I'm looking at your facial expressions and watching Danielle because she's like my boss here and I'm thinking of myself, all right, is it going well? What do you think? You know, I dunno. Uh, she looked down, oh my God. And she looked over at her boss and she went like, Oh shit. Like it's never gonna work out. I can't be like, Ugh, I've got to do yoga. Right? I can just start doing yoga right now to deal with my stress levels. I mean, I could, but like, it's not going to work very well.

Speaker 2:          44:13          So I met, I could do it and I just did a little demo, but I can't really do yoga in the moment to regulate. I've got to have cognitive strategies. Does that resonate with you? So different environments call for the Di, a different type of strategizing. And what I've learned in the last 20 years of running around talking about this stuff is that most people, if I say to them, what's your go to strategy when you're feeling this way to help you manage it? What are you talking about? They don't really have the language for it, nor do they have the tool bag with those strategies in it. And it's kind of my goal is to make sure that everybody has that tool bag. Because I know what it's like to not have the tool bag. Has anyone here ever experienced a strong emotion?

Speaker 2:          45:05          Has anyone here have experienced strong emotion that didn't regulate very effectively? And how many of you just want to live in that space for the rest of your life? Right. It's not a great place to live in. Right? So I feel like it's my duty to make sure we teach these things now. Oh my goodness. And then there's time left. So before we wrap up in the next three hours, I've all, I've talked to the five skills, recognize, understand, label, express and regulate. Um, now you know what they are. I'm going to ask you to think how emotionally intelligent are you on a scale from one to five. One, you are emotionally bankrupt. You don't have, you can't read a person from like right in front of you. You have no strategies to regulate to five, you are really skilled. Where would you say you are? How many of you give yourselves a one? Like you are just emotionally like not skilled. We've got one semi honest person too. Three, four, five. Okay. It's interesting. I would say the average and it was around 3.75. Um, how do you know?

Speaker 1:          46:29          Yeah,

Speaker 2:          46:33          I was like, I dunno how I know. How many of you have got an accurate feedback on your emotion perception. Ability.

Speaker 1:          46:43          Okay.

Speaker 2:          46:44          Or your emotion regulation skills.

Speaker 1:          46:48          Yeah.

Speaker 2:          46:48          And how do you know that it was accurate? The feedback.

Speaker 2:          46:53          What's that depends on her emotional intelligence, right? Think about it like who's giving you the feedback, right? Like my, what's that? Yeah, that might be the case. Although I've had about seven therapists in my life. Um, so it's tricky, right? This idea of self awareness around emotion skills. What my research shows by the way, is that the correlation coefficient between yourself rated emotional intelligence and your actual emotional skills is about zero. So self ratings don't go very far in this domain because it really is about a skill and a mental ability. It's like asking someone how smart they think they are or asking parents or rate how smart their kids on it. Now, what I want to wrap up with for just a few minutes of sharing you what we actually do. So we know from our research that when we measure emotional intelligence as a set of skills, it looks pretty good.

Speaker 2:          47:55          Less skilled. Kids look like this, high skilled kids look like that. We know that when we work with managers and leaders, more skills look pretty good. People like to be around people that have these skills. I just did this huge study with supervisors, emotional intelligence. So think about this same amount of work, right? If you have a supervisor who is low in emotional intelligence are high in emotional intelligence, you're working the same. This side's a little complex. But think about how you feel at work. If your supervisor is low and emotional intelligence, you're feeling inspiration 28% of the time if they're high, 80%.

Speaker 2:          48:41          So how you feel about your work and how you feel at work tends to correlate very highly with the emotional skills of your supervisor. Look at that. Feelings of burnout at work, almost triple fear of speaking up. So people are afraid to speak up and to even have an opinion when they have a supervisor who's low in emotional intelligence, engagement, triple finding purpose and meaning at your work. So what we find is that these skills really play out in meaningful and important ways in everyday life. The last thing I'll share with you is what do we do to develop them? So you've got nature, not nurture. So nature are things like your temperament and personality. Are any of you like me? Like people who worry more than you'd like to worry? Yeah, I have that. I was like born with the worry Jean. I even now I live in worry about why worry anybody else like that.

Speaker 2:          49:46          And I'm at a point now in my career like I worry about why, worry about why worry and I like mark like you're doing fine. You don't think they worry about, but then it's like, oh, something will go wrong. So that's my genetics. 10 Years of therapy, 25 years as a psychologist, 16 curriculum on emotional intelligence and I, my default is who worry. Um, nothing has changed my automatic worry, which has been frustrating. I was like, so I've learned that that is my temperament, right? That's my personality. What I need or strategies on how to learn, how to live better with who I am. I can't change my genetics, but I can change the way I, those feelings and how I regulate them in everyday life. And that's where the nurture piece comes in. It also is influenced by your own development. So guess what?

Speaker 2:          50:38          I grew up with a mom who would say things that had smoked. Honey, you're being bullied. Don't tell me the details. I'll have a breakdown. Like Ma, like I'm having a breakdown. It's like you're my mother. You're supposed to have the strategies. So, and I had a father who was a tough guy from the Bronx who son get in there. All right dad, that sounds like, yeah, I'm just going to get in there like it's not going. I'll never be the, I have a fifth degree black belt now. I really do. I mean I could eliminate anyone in this room, but like it's not in my genetics. I don't like to fight. I like the techniques. I think the movements, I don't want to hurt anybody. Want to touch anybody. So that led me to work for the last 20 years on an approach to teaching these skills.

Speaker 2:          51:24          And I'll just spend very little time on that today. And then hopefully we can get into more detail with some of the teams. We developed tools, we learned that you have to be in an environment where emotions matter, not where rules role. So we said, why don't we ask people how they want to feel. The second is a tool to build self awareness and vocabulary and strategies. We also realized that a lot of people have difficulty with triggers like certain people and certain circumstances that really activates strong emotions. So we developed a tool called the Meta moment. Then we realized that we're too self focused, right? We'll live in a world where when conflict arises, it's between and among people. So let's think about that. This is a great principal of a school named dawn. This is her emotional intelligence charter with her school in Harlem, New York, and they want to feel as a team supported and respected, peaceful, interested in power and as did appreciate it and motivated.

Speaker 2:          52:17          So she has no rules in her school, just feelings. And then they say, all right, well we've want to feel that way. What do we need to do each day in order to have those feelings? What are the specific measurable, Realistic Behaviors that we need to do each day to create that emotional climate? So it shows up in many ways. This is another high school in New York. They want to feel balanced and energized. That's where I was just in Mexico. They'd much more creative with their charters, their fifth grade classroom here in San Francisco. They wouldn't feel comfortable, confident, creative focus, ecstatic, respected and challenged. List goes on. The mood meter helps us build more awareness. So how do you build awareness of emotion? Well, you can learn the facial expressions, the body language, the vocal tones, the physiology and the behavior that occur in each of these quadrants.

Speaker 2:          53:08          You can build that vocabulary. There are 2000 words that we could plot on the motivator we use to usually you could learn how emotions influence your judgments and the way your brain operates. So for example, yellow is great for creative processing where the green is great for building consensus. You can learn strategies to help you manage the full range of emotions. And you can see that schools adopt these practices in really interesting ways through art work and other things like that. These are working with the boys and girls clubs across the United States now to build this into our after school programming, we haven't built an app where you can plot yourself on to your heart's delight. So last two minutes. Can I ask, I want to just take a moment to read this quote.

Speaker 1:          53:56          Okay.

Speaker 2:          54:00          How many of you feel like your fuse is shorter than it's ever been? I want to feel that way. Like your stimulus to response is getting tighter and tighter and tighter. That's what we're finding across the states. So we built a tool to help with that, and we say, if you take our six step seriously, now you can avoid the 12th steps later. So you are triggered, right? Most people rely on breathing exercises like that to help them deactivate. But we've learned is that there's one more piece you can throw in there. We call it seeing your best self. What we've learned is that our nation has, this is a study of thousands of people. They're begging to be more compassionate. They're saying that their best self is someone who is more compassionate. So think about that. You're triggered by someone at work or at home, you go for the automatic response.

Speaker 2:          54:56          But if you pause and say, wait a minute, my best self is someone who is more compassionate. Do you think that my guide, how you behave following that just all dodger heads. Cause that's what my research shows. It will. Then we have other ways we have to manage conflict, right? We have to realize that it's not just about me, it's about we. And we have to figure out like what was the other person actually feeling. You can't do that in the moment. You actually need time to process that. So let me wrap up by saying just two last things. First is we've done pretty big experiments on this work, randomized trials and 60 places. And I found that in schools, when you do this work, you get better outcomes for students. So you get better outcomes for teachers and classroom climates. You get less bullying and all that great stuff.

Speaker 2:          55:46          Can I ask everybody to take one last deep breath with me? Not of your life, but just have this time together. So to wrap up, how many of you believe that emotions matter? Cool. How many of you think that the skills of emotional intelligence are real? How many of you've heard of the things soft skills? That's how they think of it. What I'm here to tell you is that your brain is replete with emotion and cognition. Our goal is to have those two systems work well together. Oftentimes, one has more power than the other. Our nation is one that cares more cognition, that emotion when they're both living simultaneously. So the question is how do we infuse more emotion into the cognition?

Speaker 1:          56:33          Third,

Speaker 2:          56:34          never too early or too late to develop these skills. I promise you that never too early or too late. There's no excuses. I think fourth, there are creative ways to develop an AI face to face and using technology. Uh, I've developed an APP for example, is one way to show how technology can support you and tracking your emotions and learning over the course of a week or a month. Wow, I've been in the blue for this long. What do I need to do to shift my life a little bit? And finally, what I'll just say as my little hope for, um, proselytizing moment is that, um,

Speaker 2:          57:11          there's so much resistance in our nation right now to taking people's feeling seriously. I'm want to go to schools and I hear teachers say things like, Zip that we're not friends anymore. I'm like devastated by that. To think that like that child is not seen as someone who is a feeling creature who needs to be respected and supported and developed. And then you go into the workplace and you see people that are all stressed and they're feeling frustrated, anger. And there's not a lot of emotional intelligence really brought into the workplace environment. So my primary interest in life is to figure out ways that we can infuse these skills into the way leaders lead. And all of us are in relationship. And my hope is that by doing so, we get great outcomes, like better health, better relationships, more creativity, um, and maybe people get to achieve their dreams. Thank you so much.
