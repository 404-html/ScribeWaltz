Speaker 1:          00:05          Miami. Alec is an actress, writer and neuroscientist. Her official bio says that she's best known as Amy Farrah Fowler on the Big Bang theory. But I hope it's okay if I say that for some of us it's blossom. Yes. I'm obviously the blossom demographic. Oh, I appreciate that. Um, she is the author of beyond the sling and Mimes Vegan table and her latest book is girling up. Please welcome my and Galic. Thank you so much for joining us. Thanks for having me. Horse. Um, so to start things off, the book is called girling up. And the subtitle of the book is how to be strong, smart, and spectacular. Why those three qualities?

Speaker 2:          00:47          So the book is, um, is written for girls 10 to 18, and anyone who ever was a girl tend to 18 or knows a girl 10 to 18. Um, and we, we wanted a subtitle cause it's fun to have one, you know, and um, there's a reason that it's not, you know, how to be saucy, Sassy and sexy. Um, the, the qualities that, that I'm trying to support and give a voice to or those, you know, of strength and intelligence and you know, sort of m and a whimsical, eccentric notion of being spectacular, which can be different things for different girls. Um, but also kind of, you know, to speak to that as well. When we first saw ideas for, for covers, you know, they kind of wanted to do like, like, Ooh, here's my, I'm thinking, you know, like, like pretty headshot with glasses and you know, um, those, those were lovely photos.

Speaker 2:          01:42          But, um, I really said no, I want it to look like more my personality. Like I want to be in a cape and converse like, so there you go. I'm in a cave with converse and um, yeah, I mean, we really wanted it to feel not like a feminine, but you know, I specifically said like, it doesn't have to be pink. There's nothing biological about females that makes us want the color pink. I actually never liked the color pink and still don't. So, um, I, I like that it's, it's kind of bold and it's quirky. And you know, we have some, some sciency symbols and um, yeah, it kind of feels appropriate for strength and smartness and spectacularness. Yeah. What inspired you to write a book for girls and people who know them and have been them? Um, you know, it's funny because the three books that I have written, I was not inspired to write them.

Speaker 2:          02:31          I was, um, I was approached and, and um, this isn't just like people, you know, being nice to celebrities. Like can you should write a book. Like I was specifically approached, like, will you write this book? And I've been asked to put my face on, um, several books. Um, I don't want many, several, I don't know my book agents here, so I can't lie. Um, but I have enough books of like, will you be the face of this science book for Girls? And you know, it didn't really feel right because science is super broad and um, you know, I know how people feel about celebrity books. I totally do because I feel that way too. You know, like did they really write it? Is it authentic? Like, is it really going to be meaningful? And, um, this book came about because, so I have a website called Grok nation and I write essays about all sorts of things.

Speaker 2:          03:17          And one of the things I wrote about was there was an episode of Big Bang Theory where Sheldon and Amy have coitus for the first time. And I wrote an article about what it was like to, to not only play a late bloomer on television, but to be a late bloomer in real life and how, you know, both Jim and I kind of felt like, gosh, this is a really intimate moment, you know, that we're sharing with potentially millions of people. And I just wrote, you know, kind of a thoughtful nerdy essay about, um, you know, some of that conflict of boundaries and where my intimate brain ends and where this character's begins. And Jill Santa's Polo, who's an editor at Penguin, reached out to me and she said, I saw your article and Grok nation and I would, I would like you to write a book with this kind of voice that has an ocean of modesty without being religious or political.

Speaker 2:          04:03          Um, and I said, well, that's very kind, but, um, can we do more? And so I took my inspiration actually from Madeley Angier, who's a science writer for the New York Times. And she wrote a book called woman and intimate geography. And what it was, was actually a kind of cross species comparison of how other mammals and other animals do things versus how women do. But it really was a full geography of being a woman. And so I said to Jill, what if I basically did a version of that about the full female experience? And instead of using other species as examples, I use other cultures and a lot of places. And because I'm trained as a scientist, I kind of go from, you know, chromosomes and hormones through sex and dating to how our brains learn, how our bodies get fed and nurtured. Um, and because it is a book in the 21st century, how we deal with difficult things.

Speaker 2:          04:54          Um, mental health issues, eating disorders, depression, um, abuse, things like that. Uh, and then the final chapter is like how we make a difference in the world and encouraging young girls, um, to, to think in an age appropriate way. Um, no one ever told me to do any of these things is also really why I decided that I should write this book. My mom didn't really talk to me about any of this stuff. Um, body stuff, anything like that. My mom came from a very conservative religious household and um, yeah, just these things weren't talked about and I wished someone had talked to me about all of these things. So I wrote a book so that other girls can hear about these things.

Speaker 1:          05:28          Yeah. And, and like you said, it does, it covers a ton. Yeah. I, I'm curious now you said no one's really, no one ever really talked to you about this stuff when you were a kid. If you could give this book to like 12 year old Miami, what chapter would you point her to first?

Speaker 2:          05:42          Um, well, you know, there's a reason I put the chapters in the order that I did. Um, you know, I think starting with chapter one is a good place, but, you know, there's, there's a lot or I guess was a lot in their most, oh, what did, what did she need most? Uh, it feels like it's something my therapist would ask me. Sorry, what 12 year old Maya I'm needed most. Um, honestly I think that the chapter about intimacy, which obviously include sex and dating, which I was not ready to think about even at 16 or 17. Uh, but some of the stuff about sort of the way that we form intimate relationships with other people even that are not romantic would have been helpful. Um, you know, I included a section about how to tell if someone is not a good friend. Yeah. And literally no one ever said that to me.

Speaker 2:          06:26          It was just like I'd come home crying and like she said this about me and my mother would be like, I don't know what to do. Don't be friends with them, you know? And so it really like, it occurred to me what if we lay out guidelines for how people should treat each other, you know, and the expectations you can have. And of course it's not always going to be like that. And I'm like, I already was the kid who, you know, talk like a grownup when I was 12. It didn't make me very popular. Um, but, but no, I think that that chapter ultimately would have been very helpful in, in terms of all kinds of, um, you know, intimacy, because intimacy is, those are the relationships we have with our family and with our friends. It's not just the scary ones. Yeah. Sorry. Still even thinking of them as the scan. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. I'm 41 and it's still scary. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          07:08          You, uh, you know, talking about, um, the, the fact that when you were 12, you were already sort of talking like an adult, an adult. What was it like writing a book with all of this really big subject matter, including, you know, science and psychology and all of this stuff. Aiming it at children.

Speaker 2:          07:28          Yeah. I should also point out, um, I'd like to apologize to my publicist, Heather bezerk. Oh, I forgot to take the bandaids off my pinky toes and they are showing. So I wouldn't want anyone to look and say like, Haha, mine was wearing bandaids. I was wearing very high, high heels before and my toes were hurting. And Heather, I'll take off the bat how to wear high heels or something. I understand like there are bandaids on my pinky does. Um, but I didn't want someone to think she doesn't know there's bandage. I know it's real. It's real life. It's, this is totally worth, yeah. Very real right now. Um, how did it feel? It was difficult. You know, I'm a person who loves words. I love language. I remember many s a t words and use them often. And, uh, I really had to write a book without my full vocabulary, you know, I was allowed to use or I was, I needed to use by full intellectual and emotional vocabulary, but I had to do it with words that, um, yeah, that would make sense for a 10 to 18 year old audience.

Speaker 2:          08:22          And, um, and in addition, you know, you can't just say that things are great over and over because you can't use all of your other adjectives that can't be like, you know, everything's great, the brain's great, you know, hormones are great. Like, you know, you have to find other ways to explain things. My 11 year old son was my first kind of proper proofreader and, uh, he didn't like chapter one at all because there are a lot of diagrams of the woman's body. He wasn't interested in that at all. Uh, so that was not his favorite chapter. But, um, you know, I really want to just to know from him, like, does it flow? Is it interesting? Do I sound like a scolding mom? And he's like, you are a scolding mom. But objectively speaking, he said, um, you know, it felt right to him and there were things that were interesting. Um, not those diagrams. Right? Yeah. Right. And you have, you have two sons, right? Yeah. Eight and 11. Those aren't their names, although many Hollywood people name their children, things like that.

Speaker 1:          09:13          Can you talk a little bit about the, the decision to write a book for girls while you have sons? Are there, I'm not saying like, why didn't you write it up for your own? Believe me, I've, I've been out, I'm not, I'm more interested in just, you know, raising sons. There are also conversations that you must have to have with them about girls and their own bodies. Sure. Growing up as boys, I'm just curious how you've been thinking about that. I've,

Speaker 2:          09:37          I've gotten, I've gotten this question asked in many productive ways and several unproductive ways, um, you know, and, and in the world of social media, you see all sorts of questions. Like literally, why would you write a book for girls? Why not for boys to which I respond? Well, I did, I responded to that comment. Um, you know, or what gives you the authority? I said, well, I'm a female. I, you know, that's like, that's where we'll start. I was a girl and now I'm a woman. Um, I chose to, to write this book largely because of, you know, Jill approaching me about kind the specific voice about being a female and the fact that I grew up in the limelight, you know, I was on blossom from the time I was 14 to 19 and I started acting when I was 11. So, you know, I, I grew up in some very critical years, um, really in the public eye.

Speaker 2:          10:29          And although standards for women were different then and there wasn't social media and there wasn't, you know, kind of the, the publicity machine directed around women in particular, I think that puts a lot of pressure on us. Um, I definitely had a notion of being, you know, on display, you know, as a woman in a culture that I don't always find friendly to women. So that I think was, you know, kind of part of the perspective that I, that I wanted to bring to girling up. And, you know, the fact is I dedicated this book to my boys because you don't really, everything I do is as their mother and they will meet women in their lives who, you know, hopefully if they haven't read this book will have read other books that empower them and make them believe in the values of, of knowing more about yourself and making an impact in the world.

Speaker 2:          11:13          And, you know, people get very, um, certain people get very uppity, you know, when they hear that I'm a feminist or that I'm raising feminist children, you know, and um, you know, I'm, I'm not a person who hates men actually. I quite like men. And, um, I, I'm not raising my, my boys to be afraid of masculinity. I mean, I think a lot of people just literally don't know the definition that, you know, feminism is a, is a movement that believes in a unique role of women to break the bonds of race, class and gender. And, um, my sons understand that. And, um, there, there is information in this book about boys' bodies as well as girls bodies and much of what is in this book applies to males as well as females. So yeah, I speak to my children about hormones. Um, they know about gender fluidity because they hear it in the news and, uh, they just, you know, we just used to call it like Mama's boyish, you know, like why does Mama likes sports cars and data doesn't, you know, data lakes, musical theater just cause, you know, cause everybody's different.

Speaker 2:          12:06          So they've already had a lot of these conversations. But, you know, I think, I think it's okay for us to acknowledge that, you know, for most of human history, women have been excluded from a lot of the workplace, um, and have been denied a lot of the rights that men had. And it's okay to say that we want to have this kind of book. There are books for boys, there will continue to be books for boys. Men have written most of the books in human history. Uh, if you kind of look at like a bell curve of it, you know, um, and, and I really feel like it's totally okay to also acknowledge that, you know, the male body is very different than the female body and the fact that, you know, the male genitalia is on the outside is a lot more informative than women's bodies where everything is, you know, protected. And so there's a lot to know about what's going on in there and as well of course there are exceptions to all of these things, but women are, you know, a very verbal and social creature and there's a lot that we're not encouraged to kind of talk about and bring out. And I think men are seeing that too. You know, men can be emotional and we need to talk about all those things, but I also, you know, I don't feel like one should have to defend, you know, a special book,

Speaker 1:          13:13          um, for girls. Yeah. I feel like we're in a safe place here. I feel like not being attacked yet yet, yet. Just turn the page questions. Um, so you, you know, you have, you've written three books, you write essays and articles and all sorts of stuff and you're very outspoken as we've just seen with your, oh, that was like a warm up. Um, I actually, I read in another interview with you that you were saying that, you know, growing up Jewish, you were like raised in an argumentative tradition. I was like, yes, yes. I feel that I'll, if I want to get fancy, you can call it like the dialectic tradition, but you know, that's only in philosophy class. So they call us like being Jewish, right? Yeah. When you're out to dinner with your family over there. Right, exactly. Yeah. Um, but you do, you have a very strong and specific worldview and you know, you live that in your, all of your life choices, everything's fine. Okay. Okay. Um, you know, the, your Jewish faith and being vegan and all of this stuff. And I'm curious how you approached writing a book that would be inviting and accessible and helpful to girls from a wide range of backgrounds and have their own beliefs and their family's beliefs while still being true to your own.

Speaker 2:          14:27          Yeah, I mean, this is a great question because it's a great challenge, you know, when, when writing this kind of thing, especially because, you know, I was, I was approached really because Jill, you know, this editor at Penguin, because Jill really liked this voice that I had, which is really one of social conservatism, which you can be socially conservative even if you're a bleeding heart liberal. I promise. It's like, here I am. Um, but, um, you know, I wanted to make sure that it didn't feel like a part is in book. You know, I happen to believe in, in a certain kind of, of politics and I happen to believe in a certain religious tradition. And you know, one of the ways that I talk about that historically people cope, you know, in the chapter on how we cope is by you know, structured, organized activities, some of which are religious in nature.

Speaker 2:          15:13          But I really tried to kind of at every turn I'm saying, you know, even if this doesn't work for you, here are some of the advantages of people congregating regularly in a community setting. Um, just to again, sort of give information that can then be used to make decisions. And I think, you know, a lot of times you get knee jerk reactions or you know, I responded in a knee jerk fashion really for much of these years. So I think being presented lots of different options is healthy and also presenting information in a way that there are many options is helpful. Um, but for me, you know, in the, in the chapter on, you know, basically in nutrition and what we eat and how our body is fueled by that. I do talk about my, my personal choices. Yes, I happen to be Vegan, but I make it really clear and it's really true.

Speaker 2:          15:56          I know that being Vegan is not for everyone. You know, we all know that every major medical organization says we all should eat less processed foods and less meat and less animal byproducts. Um, but, but I didn't want that to be an agenda of the book. And I wrote a Vegan cookbook for God's sake. Like if you want an agenda book, like that's it, you know. Um, but I do think, you know, it's also important, you know, to look at all, all aspects of these kinds of angles. And I did talk about how many young girls and yes, some young boys as well, but many young girls, um, are, uh, adopting a vegetarian or Vegan diet as a way to lose weight. And that's actually not, you know, the purpose. I mean, yes, some people do tend to lose weight. It's, you can also gain weight as a vegetarian or a Vegan.

Speaker 2:          16:38          Um, but I made sure to also point to some of the larger issues because you know, those, again, those are things that weren't really talked about and it is important for us to talk about them. And it's, you know, the kind of thing that feels Yucky, you know, when you hear of, you know, a friend's daughter or a niece or whatever who, you know, is having eating problems and it's being couched in, in eating preferences. Those are complicated things. But I really think it's healthy to get it out there. I hope that it is. Yeah. And it's, it's so tricky to talk about because on the one hand, any kind of restrictive eating can be a signal of something raised kosher. So it's like, you know, we have thousands of years of restrictions, but I, for like when a young girl starts taking that on, it's tied in with all this other sort of baggage, but it can also, you know, I know people who've started eating vegetarian or Vegan for health or sort of vague restrictive reasons and then along the way, like discover other reasons and sort of like pack on that I suppose as you go.

Speaker 2:          17:33          Yeah, that was kind of, that was my story as well, so, yeah. But, um, back to the, I guess the sort of the conservatism can be the idea of being sort of conservative while also bleeding heart liberal. The, you mentioned modesty earlier and one of the things that really intrigued me in the book actually was your mention of modesty in the acknowledgements. Um, you think two women who I think are both rabbis, right? Uh, remind me I didn't write their names down. Shall lead. When does she'll eat, wrote a return to modesty. It was drag knowledge. Her, hold on, hold on. This is fun. Tell us who she is while I look this up. Uh, well when he shall lead, uh, is an author who wrote, returned to modesty. She's not a rabbi, but she wrote a book about sort of the, the, the reclaiming that a lot of women are doing, um, not necessarily in a, you know, in a religious manner.

Speaker 2:          18:24          Um, but to reclaim the notions of having choices about what they wear and how they were, did you find it? I did find it. So I think you mentioned as mentioned in the chapter. So here it was Aviva Colon, Alison Joseph's. Both of whom are not rabbis. This is why I wasn't sounding familiar. Um, yeah, Alison Joseph's is a, is an online presence. She goes by June the city. She was actually, I met her through partners in Torah, which is a free organization that sets you up with someone who can teach you really anything you want to know about Judaism. And one of the main things that, and she's literally, I mean, I don't want to say she's just a mom, but she's not a a Jewish educational professional. At that time, she and I were both new moms. Um, she ended up kind of developing an online presence and website, educating people about modern orthodoxy.

Speaker 2:          19:09          Um, but anyway, so that's who Alison Joseph says. And one of the things we studied through partners in Torah was modesty and why Jewish women have rules and what the rules are for Jewish men of Eva coal is a [inaudible], which means she's married to a rabbi. Um, and she was the woman awkward. She was the woman that I studied with before I got married. So in traditional Jewish weddings, um, this may sound strange. Um, women typically study, uh, things about being married with women. And men typically study things about being married with men. And if you've ever heard of a Mikvah, which is a ritual bath, um, that is a spiritual and a legal place that you immerse, think of like a really holy Jacuzzi. It's like that. Um, I studied all of the rules. There are, you know, thousands of years of tradition, um, surrounding the use of that ritual and tradition.

Speaker 2:          20:02          And it was something I've written about very publicly, um, because I, I found it very, um, very, um, comforting to have that as a, as a monthly ritual. Typically, um, Jewish women go after their menstrual cycle ends. Um, and it is a not because we're dirty or horrible, which is, you know, what a lot of people assume, but I found it very empowering and you know, I do identify as a feminist who is part of the structure of patriarchy, you know, in that I am part of a, a Jewish tradition, which is, you know, patriarchal in its origins. Um, but yeah, that was a lot cause everyone, okay. Like, I may have hurt someone. Okay. So then you're like, what do I ask next? I was just, I,

Speaker 1:          20:48          I'm going to continue the question cause I'm sorry. That's it. I still have the question, which was, um, you, so what you write and yes, this is what it's like to date me. This is literally this problem and what just happened is what it's like. It's not a problem. Okay. Thank you. Are we dating? So the two women, I think two women you think and you write that they, um, they taught me the ways of decorum, modesty and grace in the ancient origins of these gifts have increased my concept of worth dignity and the divine ability to love and be loved. I thought that was so lovely. It was kind of lovely. I forgot that I wrote, can you talk a little bit about what that means?

Speaker 2:          21:26          Ah, I think that, um, you know, you pick like one of the most intimate thank you. Besides my ex boyfriend and my ex husband who are also thanked in there. Um, yeah, I think that for me, um, you know, I came late to observance. Um, I was not raised religious. My mother was raised Orthodox and very, very, I'm kind of old world. Her parents were immigrants. She didn't speak English and her home, they only spoke Yiddish. So, um, she kind of raised me reform, um, meaning she didn't want a lot of ritual. And, um, when I was in college, I took on more observance. And one of the things that was very empowering for me was to meet women who did not feel oppressed. Um, and also women who didn't simply say like, I'm part of the patriarchy, therefore I don't feel oppressed. These were intelligent college educated women, which you don't have to be going to college to be educated, but you know what I mean?

Speaker 2:          22:20          This wasn't the stereotype of like, the woman who went, you know, got married at 17 and never saw the outside world. These are women who had lived in an integrated society, um, and who were gorgeous, um, felt empowered in how they presented themselves. And I'm not going to pretend that there are many women who want to be modest and still be attractive. Um, honestly, Alison dresses in clothing that I would feel uncomfortable in because it's too tight, but it's very, you know, for her it's very modest than it is modest by most standards. But to meet women who had fulfilling lives as women, again within this kind of religious structure was very comforting. And I found that the rules of, um, you know, uh, it's, it's there, it's called family purity. It sounds better in Hebrew, I promise. Um, but I found that the, the rules governing, um, marriage and love and intimacy really protected something that I believe is very sacred.

Speaker 2:          23:16          And even though I'm divorced, you know, I think that my, Mike, I think that my, my ex would agree, like, um, there was a lot of, there were a lot of healthy boundaries, you know, in our relationship. And you know, when I think about, you know, when I got pregnant, it was, you know, after visiting a spiritual ritual bath where I had like a mystical, you know, experience of this notion of you can be reborn, you know, by, by immersing and having this experience, um, that's really, you know, that's pleasant and it's bitter sweet. I don't do that anymore because not married. Um, there are people who go to the ritual bath, um, in other non traditional ways, but for the kind of traditional person that I am, it really felt like something sacred in, in the context of my marriage. Um, and I credit those women with really helping me find beauty in something that a lot of people consider just, you know, kind of a knee jerk reaction like that sexist. That's awful. Um, and I also feel like there's so many things, not only in religion but in life as well. You know, that it's easy to sort of dismiss like that. But, um, you know, I chose to make a commitment to get educated about it. And for me it was very rewarding. I know not everyone would have that experience. And that's fine too.

Speaker 1:          24:21          Um, we're going to open it up for questions in a minute. So if you have a question, please stand by one of the microphones in the aisle. Um, but before we go to that, so the, the book gives a lot of advice to girls, suggestions, suggestions, some framework, some guidelines if you want some ideas. Um, are there any suggestions then that you would, since you've spent so much time sort of getting into the minds of girls between 10 and 18 and thinking about what they're going through, are there any suggestions that you would offer to the parents of girls?

Speaker 2:          24:55          Don't let your children have phones or leave the house. Does that work? That's kind of what to know. Light does it to know, I know that it doesn't. Um, no, I think that, well, I know that, you know, for me as a parent, I think whether I had boys or had girls, I do put a lot. And so, so does my ax. We do put a lot of, um, structure and boundaries around the kind of information are children have access to and, um, what, what and, and knowing what they're doing. And for us, um, for us that's comforting. I think that a lot of parents, especially parents who are younger than I am, you know, cause I, I could easily, well I'm 41 so do the math, you know, I could easily easily have a 20 year old or older. Um, you know, I think a lot of parents in that sort of middle generation, um, are sometimes nervous to, to not be friendly or be friends with their kid.

Speaker 2:          25:45          And I think there's a lot of benefit to that, you know, and you know, I sort of, I was raised in like a, you know, I was raised in a house where I didn't have a lot of voice. Um, um, because that's how people raise children back then. So I think that there's, there's something in between that I would hope people find. But that being said, I think it's okay to say no, and I think it's okay to say, um, yeah, you're, you're not ready for a phone, which, you know, my 11 year old is stomping his foot every other day at us. Um, but I do think it's okay to say, I need your passwords. Um, what are you doing on the computer? What are you watching? Uh, and, and I also think we shouldn't be afraid to upset children. Um, because a lot of times I think I, I'm sometimes afraid to make decisions because I'm afraid, you know, that they'll feel controlled or there'll be mad at me, you know. Um, but I think it's very important for parents to know that. I hope that this book will kind of open up conversations in terms of TV time and screen time and things like that. Um, and in terms of like the sex and dating chapter, like that's going to really vary by kid. You know, I wasn't ready to learn that kind of information until much later on that, you know. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          26:59          All right. We have a question over here. Hi. Um, a couple of years ago, I read an article about pedophilia culture and it talks about, um, things like resilient waxes and calling women girls. And at that time I made the choice, I am no longer going to call women girls and maybe that shows a couple of years ago and it's, it's always this conscious effort. And, um, I've gotten comfortable with it myself and I've gotten comfortable correcting someone when they refer to me as a girl, you know, Google girl, Bianca, you know, and I could get that. I'm like, no Google woman. Um, but what, I'm not making an alliteration issue. I defend your right to correct, not yet comfortable doing is correcting that people when they refer to other women as girls. And so you just posted a video much more fun on, on social media, which I really, really appreciated. Um, and I hear this happening all the time. I hear my colleagues referring to other Google women as girls. I hear them referring to clients or agency partners as girls. And it bugs me, but I don't, I don't know how to address it. And so I have been saying nothing and I would like to say something and I would like your thoughts on how to address it. Um, I didn't know where you were going to go with that question. That I am much more relaxed right now than it was 30 seconds ago.

Speaker 2:          28:16          Um, so uh, Bianca was that your name? Yes. What beyond cause referring to um, his eye. So I make youtube videos and um, you know, there's, there's not necessarily a rhyme or reason as to why something goes viral, but we did have a video go viral for the first time. I think it has 9.6 million views or something. And it was about why we shouldn't call women girls. Um, then I released science and religion about sort of my lack of conflict they're in and that went viral the next week. We had like a big month, you know, it was a very big month. So it's funny because this is something I've been ranting about since I'm like 14 years old. Like this is just something that's always really bothered me. And the video was originally longer cause I got, believe me, I got a lot of comments if, why didn't you talk about this?

Speaker 2:          28:55          What about this? You know, what about the south in Tennessee, there's a region where men are called boys and like why, you know, like all these like specific anecdotal exceptions that prove that I'm a horrible person. So anyway, but, um, there are originally was, um, a part of that video that talked about exceptions, um, in, in, in intimate settings or, um, you know, like, hey girlfriend, you know, like that, things like that. Um, but we, you know, my, my, uh, creative creative partner and CEO, he manwell shall love is in charge of all edits. And he said, this is what I want to do. Um, but I think, you know, I actually hadn't thought about it in terms of pedophilia culture that like, this is literally what I'll be thinking about for the rest of the day and into the evening. No, cause I think that's really fascinating.

Speaker 2:          29:37          I find it easier to correct other people. And I think that's really interesting, right? That were too strong. You know, women, um, who like red lipstick and you know, for me, I have a really hard time correcting people. And it's funny cause I think I might've been on the view of this morning and I think if someone might have sat and I, it would never occur to me to say like, I'm a woman. Like I couldn't do it. But the example I give is like my publicist who's here. Um, you know, when people say like, she's such a great girl, you know, for me, I really am just what I talked about in the video. I say, um, she's a woman, you know? And yeah, doing it with a smile is just something that as women sometimes, you know, helps, you don't always have to do it.

Speaker 2:          30:21          But as I said, people will hate you less to your face if you smile. Um, you know, I think that in terms of correcting other people, that's really how I do it. And I think it's important to realize that we, although it should be, I think remedied every single time. There also has to be some flexibility in how we approach things. Like, I sometimes feel like it's my job to fix the whole world, but I also have to know that I'm, I'm part of it. And I also have to function in social situations. And sometimes, and I'm not saying like, oh, um, you know, everybody wants me to strip naked at this party. I guess I should, you know, I'm talking about being flexible in terms of there are times when I feel like, you know what, if I'm this uncomfortable and I know my convictions and I know how I want to behave, this may not be the time to do it, you know? So I think that's important too, to give yourself a break and know that you're not solely responsible. Um, you have celebrities like me to take a general bullet for feminists everywhere, um, and have everyone hate on me because of it. Um, but I commend you for correcting it and, um, I will try and take some inspiration for you and try and find creative ways to correct people. Maybe like a snap might be good. Like I'm a woman. No, I didn't say thank you. Yeah. Not feels good now. Yeah, it's great. We're done. Yes.

Speaker 3:          31:39          Can you talk about that other video that you did? The science and religion one? I thought it was amazing. Oh, thank you. It was very smart and just like really beautiful and touching at the same time. Um, so maybe like what inspired it and what was the reaction to it?

Speaker 2:          31:56          Yeah, so I'm, I'm a scientist. I'm trained as a neuroscientist and I'm, I'm also a person of faith and usually the people that ask if I have conflict about that typically are not scientists and they're not religious. And I, you know, I like to point out that sometimes at no insult to atheists or agnostics, but sometimes those people are more fanatical and religious about being atheist or agnostic than I am about being a religious person. And, um, you know what I, what I talked about in that video, and again, this is something I've been ranting about, you know, for 15 years, um, I have never felt conflict. Um, I, I've never met other orthodox or religious people, um, who feel conflict. I've never met a WHO believes that the world was literally created in six days. And then God rested on the set. Like it's, you know, I, there, there was a quote that my rabbi used to quote a lot, you know, if you think that the, the Torah, you know, the Old Testament is a science book.

Speaker 2:          32:51          I have better science books on my shelf, you know, like, um, the, the Torah is a, is an historical religious, spiritual, mystical document. Um, it is not meant to be a science book. And one of my favorite realizations that I had is that, um, we can call it different things, this, this notion of faith, but if someone has a belief that the sun will come up tomorrow, which I would say we can mostly all agree on, to me that's the same faith as me believing that the universe is divine and things like the sun coming up happen and the fact that when the sun comes up, I come from a religious and ethnic tradition where we thank God for that happening. For a lot of people, the way that they acknowledge that is simply to have the alarm go off and get up and I don't have right to pass judgment on how people choose to commemorate the divine act of the sun coming up.

Speaker 2:          33:46          So it's kind of like Neil degrasse Tyson says, you know, science is great because you don't have to believe in it for it to be true. I kind of feel that way about a mystical notion of of something divine in the universe. You know, I don't have to believe that the sun's going to come up, it's going to come up. And for me, I just, I don't feel conflict about that. Everything I've ever learned in the scientific world has made me appreciate the divinity of the universe. I've never once said, gosh, the eye is so complicated. It had to be created by God. I don't even have to think like that. The eye is so unbelievable because it exists in the context of a universe that that is ruled by physics and chemistry and all of the things that humans have to give names to.

Speaker 2:          34:22          And really the same applies for religion and for God. You know, those are concepts that exist, whether we name them or not, it doesn't matter what language you say it in the fact that we called the number six, the number six, those are all just arbitrary linguistic classifications for things that literally exist. Um, so yeah, like for me it just feels like all is good in the navy or hood of science and God, I like how you also related that I'm wondering the world to like internal. Yeah. I got all emotional recording and like that was for real. Yeah, it's emotional. Yeah, no it is. Um, and we do have time for one or two more questions. If anyone wants to come see me and my ex, well, I have five more, but yes, go ahead. I'll ask the question. Hi, I'm Nikki. My question was how do you balance being a social conservative with being free liberal?

Speaker 2:          35:11          Um, you know, I think it's funny because this is something I'm asked a lot, you know, I think, I'm not trying to be facetious, I just am, you know, so the fact that like I don't like to wear a sleeveless or strapless dresses or that, um, I prefer that no one's seen me in a bathing suit. Like, you know, the, the fact that I make distinctions about the way I present myself as a woman and that I find that empowering to me that is absolutely a no with the fact that we should not use the death penalty. Like I'm 100% certain in my mind, um, that we should not kill people. And um, you know, for me, like I was raised, my parents were civil rights activists and they were actually, um, they were part of the integration of public school system here in New York.

Speaker 2:          35:54          And my grandparents were immigrants. Like, you know, I was raised as a union support, like liberal values work for me all the way around. Um, as a Jewish person for most of Jewish history in America, we have aligned ourselves with the Democratic party because the principles of welcoming the stranger and upholding the fallen and healing the sick, um, is really part of what I believe my religious tradition dictates. But the fact that I don't like the fact that I don't necessarily want to see everyone's breasts and butt cheeks in my life every day, but in Los Angeles, that's kind of what it's like. Um, you know, if I had daughters, I would be a very conservative parents in terms of dress. Um, when my children and I go to synagogue, much as I believe that religion shouldn't be a thing that children hate because you have to wear stuffy clothing.

Speaker 2:          36:40          I do believe in a notion of decorum that way. I'm old fashioned, you know, that's what people say. Um, I liked domestic things. I like cooking, cleaning and sewing. Anytime I've ever been in a romantic relationship, my favorite thing is to like, what kind of Pie can I make? Like I just, I, I'm just that kind of person. I also will make pie that I like as well. Don't worry. Um, no, but I think those things get kind of put in that social conservative sort of box. Um, but you know, someone pointed out I was on what show is it? Was it James Corden? Heather, I don't know if she's still here. Yeah, it was a James Corden when I flashed piers Morgan with my Tatas. Okay. Um, I was on James Corden and Piers Morgan was on and he's someone that, you know, I sometimes agree with but largely don't, and Susan Surandon had just done like that in Memoriam thing and piers Morgan was like super critical and felt like tweeting about how her breasts shouldn't have been hanging out.

Speaker 2:          37:31          And this is a, a great, a great kind of intersection of my universes where, um, I was really annoyed at Piers Morgan because like there are definitely more important things to think about then Susan Sarandon's breasts and would, I would I agree that like if you're doing a Memoriam and I'm thinking more about your cleavage then the dead people. Sure. It's awkward. But what I did is I turned my back to the camera and I flashed Piers Morgan. I was wearing a bra, you know, there was coverage fine. Um, but someone pointed out, you know, that was like an intersection of my rebellious feminism. I didn't do it to the camera, you know, I turned my back. So anyway, it's still not okay, I'm sure by a lot of people's standards. But when I feel like, you know, how do you combine them? You just do and there's no hard and fast rules.

Speaker 2:          38:08          You know, someone pulled up a picture that was taken, I did a photo shoot in Israel, um, and I'm wearing a sheer top, sorry, I'm wearing a sheer top and yes, you can see cleavage because I'm wearing whatever. I'm wearing a sheer top, you know. And people were so quick to say like, ha ha caught you. I'm like, really? Is this the world that we live in, that people are trolling to find pictures where I violate certain notions of modesty to prove that I'm, you know, I've never said that I do anything perfectly. Um, but I definitely think that the death penalty should not be allowed.

Speaker 2:          38:40          Thank you. You do a perfect job of not killing people. I perfectly don't want people to die that way. Oh No. Yeah, yeah. I mean some, sometimes people die. It happens, but right. Too soon to talk about death apparently. Always. But it also sounds like one of the differences is that you're not imposing your views. You're not saying that like the laws of the country and to that should be written on your, I have feelings about the laws of the country, but yes. Well, so my laws of the country I think should opt for more freedom, more acceptance, more rights, civil rights, human rights, rights for women, rights for gays, rights for Trans People. Yeah. I'm all for that. Um, yes. And rights for criminals and rights for murderers because I'm, again, I'm like an, I'm an old fashioned supporter of those kinds of rights.

Speaker 2:          39:27          Um, and you know, if I were in, in politics or if I had a Facebook page with a lot of followers, I would probably take a lot of stances and I choose to. Um, but, you know, I think it's very difficult. There are certain arenas where I get to say, um, I'm Vegan. You don't have to be. However, if you want to talk about economics and the environment, um, and our impact on the environment, then maybe we should have a conversation about Vegan. We all should, you know, and I think that's how I feel, you know, I don't understand. Um, I mean, I don't want to talk about, I mean we can't talk about politics. People want to do, but I literally don't understand what's happening really anymore. Um, and I don't understand a lot of places where, where, and how we can affect change.

Speaker 2:          40:11          Why I as a celebrity, why anyone should care. What I think. Um, and I understand I have that conflict myself. Why do I do this? Why do I write, you know, why, why do I share this on a platform with millions of people? Um, and I think I kind of decided like, this is a new world. There really aren't rules for what happens when a celebrity has 2 million followers and has the power to say, if you believe in the right, you know, for women to choose what to do with their wounds, you may want to check out planned parenthood or the ACL ou or the anti defamation league. You know, like those are, it's a hard place to be. And I also don't want people to think that I do that cavalierly. Yeah. You can say cavalier be right. Yeah. Or in a cavalier fashion that set skills coming out again. Oh yeah. I believe. I think we have one more question.

Speaker 3:          40:55          Yeah. Thanks so much for being here. I'm very excited to read your book and I'm Darcy. I was curious to know more about your writing process for this book, specifically anything about the writing process, but, um, I was curious if you talked with the girls 10 to 18 as you were writing, um, and also if there was anything that you thought about putting in the book that you didn't end up

Speaker 2:          41:17          a baby wants to know. This is a good question. So, um, you asked about the writing process, what was the second thing if you talk to, if I talked with it. So, yeah, I'm, I'm a, I'm a bad student in this sense because Jill Santa Paula was, here are some teen websites that you should read to know how teens talk. I'm glad she's not here. I didn't look at them and um, honestly I don't want to say I didn't want to talk to 10 to 18 year old girls. Um, but in, in my arrogance and grandiose fashion as a writer, I really felt like I had this. Um, and I know girls in this age range and my son being 11, I have friends whose daughters are the same age. And so I know plenty of girls. You know, we had a babysitter and I watched her go from 15 to 18.

Speaker 2:          42:07          Um, but no, I, I'm going to be super honest. I didn't feel that it was necessary. And I don't just mean because like I got a phd and you know, in neuroscience I get to say whatever I want. I will say also, and I give credit to the women. We had review the book, we had a school counselor, a neuropsychologist, um, a pediatrician and an ob Gyn review the book. Um, yeah, there were things about how I think that the pill is over prescribed for girls and that we have a crisis of the treatment of hormones in young women that was removed from the book. Just going to go ahead and say it. Um, yeah. Um, I mentioned Ricki lake prominently on the work that she has done to advocate for natural birth and for, um, education about the overprescription of the pill. And, um, I got some, where's Anthony Materra?

Speaker 2:          42:52          I got some healthy pushback, not from Anthony Materra. Um, I got some healthy pushback about that. Um, that surprised me because I know so many young women who are put on the pill before their bodies even know what they're doing hormonally. Um, especially girls and underserved populations where they're not getting followup care and no one cares because, sorry. A lot of, we don't care about poor people is the message that a lot of, um, a lot of girls get. Um, so that I was kind of surprised about. Um, and in terms of the writing process, so, you know, um, my, my dad, bless his memory was a writer. Um, I've always been a creative writer and I, I, even though I got a degree in neuroscience, I minored in Hebrew and Jewish studies because it helped keep my GPA up because I could write a really good essay.

Speaker 2:          43:38          I got an a plus in the third riot and the Jews, because I wrote so many great essays about the third riot. Um, no, but my, my writing skills are really more in kind of essay form. Writing a book is very, very different. And for this book, I literally, I took a piece of paper for every category of our existence, meaning, you know, um, sex and dating hormones and puberty. And then I took postits and I wrote questions that I would've wanted answered for each of those categories. And I wrote them on postits. So each piece of paper had, you know, a dozen posts. And then the way that I started writing is I started answering those questions. That's literally the way the book was written. I started answering those questions and I crossed it off. There's something I'm never like, I'm a list maker.

Speaker 2:          44:20          I'm a postit lover. So this was a very gratifying experience. Um, you know, and like pretty Charpie, different colors for each chapter. Um, so that's what it was like. And I carried those pieces of paper around with me. Um, I actually finished a screenplay and I wrote in a very similar fashion that I did by large note cards, laid on a hotel bed and I locked myself in a room and wrote a screenplay. Um, but yeah, this book was very similar and I did take time away. I'm really a person who loves the writing process. Like I love to be literally like I lock myself in a hotel room. I opened the door only to get French fries and green salad and instead like, you know, beers or like a little wine at dinner. Um, but that's really how I wrote this book. And I went away and didn't talk to anyone and it was great. And I just sat in a room and that's when I was told, you are a writer when you love being in a room by yourself with a bottle of red wine and a bowl of pasta and some French fries and, and the thing. You're right. You're right. Yeah. No one else. Just me. Yeah. All right. Well that's all the time. This was really fun. Thank you.
