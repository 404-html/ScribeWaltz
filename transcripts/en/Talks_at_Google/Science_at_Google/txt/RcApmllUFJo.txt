Speaker 1:          00:05          Okay. So without further ado, can you please give a warm welcome to today's speaker, Christina and rush.

Speaker 2:          00:11          [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          00:15          Thank you very much. Can everybody hear me okay? Yeah. So it's such a pleasure to be here. Thank you very much. They will welcome. I'm a child and family psychotherapist, so I work with families from various backgrounds with various difficulties. Um, but the other things that I do is I like to talk to people about what the code research says about brain development in children for babies and children. Um, because I think this is information that should be available to every petite, not just psychologists, therapists, medical professional, social workers. It's information that we all know. It can make an enormous difference to how we live our lives in our relationships with not just with our children, but also with each other, with our partners, with our friends, with our extended family. So what I'm going to talk to you about today extends across many different aspects of our lives.

Speaker 1:          01:17          Um, and, uh, I hope you go away feeling informed, but also inspired, uh, in what you bring to other people, to your relationships in your life. Because I'm going to be talking about the importance of those relationships far our physical and our mental health. So we know now from all the research in neuroscience that, um, uh, charge brain development is very much dependent on the quality of the social relationships that that child has in their lives. And the child's, the foundations of the brain are very much built on those relationships, what they bring to the child and how they manifest, um, as, as impact on the brain. So I'll be talking about that. So the aim of the presentation is really to talk to you about the neuroscience and how emotional visibility and the input in terms of the relation relational quality of the apples around the child have a powerful impact on the neurochemistry, the neurobiology. So the structural aspects of brain development, the neurochemical, so how the hormones and chemicals respond in our brains and in our bodies and overall how that influences the structural development of the brain bundles. So the social, emotional and cognitive development. Just before I get going, or if you just wanted to, uh, I'm curious about what brought many of you here today. So would anybody be willing to say, if you had a question in your mind that you with you that you'd like to explore?

Speaker 2:          03:04          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          03:06          Hi. Um, we, I have two young toddlers at home. They're two and three and they're in crashed part time when we're thinking my putting them into crash full time. And I don't know if being in a crash in these formative years we'll have any negative impact. And it's something that that does kind of concern is Maria. So, wow. So for me, it's Ryan, I suppose if we're not available as parents, does it, does that have any kind of impact? That's a good question. Thank you.

Speaker 2:          03:36          Anybody else?

Speaker 3:          03:38          Yeah, the three young kids and, um, just obviously interested in the neuroscience son, their direct development, but also just curious as to, um, how the relationship between the parents can impact the children and any of the science around that. That could be useful.

Speaker 1:          03:58          Okay, great. So I'm just going to just, uh, to hold those questions. That's the penny or somewhere. So we have less than an hour left. Um, so I'm just going to, uh, capture that as parents together and then, uh, young children and crashes.

Speaker 2:          04:29          MMM.

Speaker 1:          04:31          Just so because of the limited time we have, we won't be able to go into any of this in great detail, but hopefully I'll be able to touch on it for you. Um, in talking about the, uh, what it is that shapes brain development. Okay. So the jury is in that we know that we need each other people need people. That's how we develop in a healthy way, both physically and emotionally. And I do add in physical, because there's quite a few studies now across the world, um, that demonstrate the importance of emotional health for physical health. So relationships build brains, minds. We know that, we know that, um, from the neural science and the buyer, the research into biochemistry, but actually relationships come to regulate our nervous systems. So they come to bring us into emotional balance if they work well. And that's because our hormonal systems sync with each other.

Speaker 1:          05:33          And, but this is particular important for infants, for babies. Uh, and I'll be, uh, uh, elaborating on this as we go along. But for babies and for all of us, you know, the idea of being in sync with each other, no, if you heard of that, um, it is in terms of being emotionally and think it means how neuro biologically by chemically we're in with each other. That's how our systems are connecting on that level. And biochemistry is like electricity. We can't see it, but we know it exists. Right? Does everybody convinced electricity exists by now? Um, so it's interesting. There are all these chemical processes going on that affect us with each other, but we don't, we don't know what's happening, but certainly the research has been able to substantiate that. Um, and the more so a little, uh, proposition that I'm throwing at you today is the more individualistic we become, the more anxious than depressed we've become as humans.

Speaker 1:          06:36          And there's plenty of evidence to demonstrate that social isolation. It has, uh, holds the biggest threat to our mental health. And, um, you may well know that the greatest form of torture is what solitary confinement. And it's used for a reason because it really has such a detrimental impact on us as human beings. Um, relationships heal troubled brains. We also know that from the research into how therapy works and actually across thousands of a therapeutic approaches, there wasn't very many, many models of therapy. What we know, the common denominator in terms of what makes a difference is the quality of the relationship between the practitioner and the client. And actually I would say that goes for any professional. If you go to GP, if your GPA is not particularly relational, if will be a very different experience and outcome for you. Would you agree with that?

Speaker 1:          07:34          And there is a lot of research into the relationship with the medical practitioner and how that can impact and how, whether we get better and how quickly we get better. So that's all that's really interesting. Um, and we're all in as resilient as humans, as the people we're connected to. So we're all both vulnerable and resilient. So it's not the one person is resilient another innocent. But it depends on many factors. So resilience is actually a social phenomenon rather than just about the grips that you have as a human being. I've got that comes into it and how you develop your capacity to be able to bounce back from stress and challenge. But without other people around us. Actually we won't. We will not be particularly resilient. And something very important, which is actually widely known in research in education, but it's not necessarily mirrored in our educational systems as they function on the ground, is that learning is a social experience.

Speaker 1:          08:37          Children learn from people they like. Would you agree with that? From your experience in school, you didn't have a relationship with the teacher? How well did you do with that subject? Yeah, so in terms of how we take on new skills, new information, new knowledge, new awareness, those relationships are really key and what we're seeing now in terms of people who have a developmental health problems, what makes a difference is not somebody painting your diagnosis on them and telling them what's wrong with them, but it's actually people coming together as a group in the community. And thinking about their strengths and thinking about what it is that empowers them to be able to overcome the challenges that they're facing with their mental health. So the facts from neuroscience about babies brains, and we've got a little exhibit over here in the corner, is that babies are born with a hundred billion neurons.

Speaker 1:          09:39          Did you know that? That's a lot of neurons rights, but they're not connected. That's the thing. There are there in the brain, but they're not connected yet. And so the waiting and they need that social experience in order to connect the need, that interaction with the adults around the baby, the baby needs that in order for those connections to get made. And by the age of, um, three, what we're finding from neuroscience is that about 85 to 90% of a baby's brain is connected. So that's why the first three years are so vital and that baby's experience is going to have a big impact on how they move forward. So we're talking about foundation, a foundational development of the brain. Now it's important to know that actually not all is lost if a baby has a poor experience. Um, some babies are born into families where parents are not available, not able emotionally to take care of them because they have maybe drug problems, alcohol problems.

Speaker 1:          10:46          So with ever depression gets in the way and through no fault of the parent to no fault of their own, it can make it difficult for them to connect. And for those babies, if they do have a poor start, the science shows that actually those, those connections can develop, play to run if the baby has the experience of the input for that. So we also know from science that the brain is like a muscle. If we don't use it, we lose it. And certainly in Airlie development are babies born with far more neurons than they actually need. And so if they're not being stimulated, the baby's not having a variety of social, emotional, cognitive experiences, physical experiences than those neurons don't connect up. And actually what the neuroscience says, they actually die away. They, they, they, um, uh, wither and die if they're not stimulated, not used.

Speaker 1:          11:49          And also it's interesting because we're, I think we're living in a world, we have been certainly through the of the nineties, the, the era of, of kind of the frontal brain and thinking a lot about talking a lot about cognition as rational thinking, but actually what the science is saying now, it's the social, uh, uh, influence, the social experience and maybe has that has the greatest impact on the quality of brain development. And we know that the bay, the brain builds from the base upwards. So you have your very primitive brain here at the back. So baby's not born with the higher structures built yet, but they have the deeper emotional structures. And within that we have our primitive brain, but also our emotional brain. We know, you know, only too well, that babies cry a lot, don't they? Not Yours. Oh Wow. You're very lucky. You're very lucky.

Speaker 1:          12:49          Not every parent will have had that experience, but babies cried from the primitive brain because they're terrified. They've never been here before. Actually, that depends. What do you believe in reincarnation or not? But, um, when I say, uh, they've, they don't know what to do. They need the adults to guide them, to give them information, to help them make sense of their experience in order to feel safe and secure. And so babies will work from that primitive brain and cry when things are scary or the anxious or their heart are in need of care. Um, and these circuits which are in the deeper primitive brain and the emotional brand there, the structure is on which later brain development gets built and how those structures are actually nurtured in the first three years particularly is very important, uh, as, as I'll go on to talk about, so that's a little picture of your brain.

Speaker 1:          13:51          That's the one side. Uh, if somebody took a chainsaw and cut your head and half, I hope that never happens to anybody in the soldiers. And that's what you'll see. And I'm here. You've got these deeper structures, so it's not coming up very well with the, so here you've got the deeper structures, the primitive brain and that that goes across here. And down here is the emotional brain. The limbic brain is called. And in that you've got this structure called the Amygdala, which is the alarm system. And if you are frightened or if you're anxious or if you're angry, and some positive emotions are connected to the mental as well, but very much connected with fear and anxiety and threatened the ed experiences that where you perceived threat, you're a middle and we'll go off to your alarm. It's like the alarm in your house, a fire alarm or your burglar alarm.

Speaker 1:          14:47          If something feels threatening, the alarm will go off. And that will put you into, you know this I'm sure fight, flight or freeze. Yeah. And that propels you to react in order to survive and protect yourself. That's how we take care of, take care of ourselves as humans. And it's how we survive. So baby doesn't actually have the higher brain. So the part across the top and at the front here is called the prefrontal cortex. Well, the whole, the whole structure is called the cortex. But this here is particularly important is the prefrontal cortex. And that's the part of the brain that used to think, reflect. What else might you use it for? You think? Planning, grades, anything else? Learning. Yes. Processing information. Yep.

Speaker 2:          15:44          Sorry.

Speaker 1:          15:46          Predict. Brilliant. Yeah. So to predict things, to be able to analyze information and then make predictions to draw conclusions. Yeah. Uh, so we've got problem solving in there as well. Impulse control, emotional regulation. So we need this part of our brain to help to regulate our emotions. So you can see how important it is that the frontal lobe is connected to the Amygdala, particularly that limbic part of the brain. Because those two parts of the brain need to work in tandem. Well for us to be able to manage ourselves, particularly around our more primitive emotions are impulse desiring something in a moment. And you know, if we make a rash decision, that's it, I'm going to have it. That might, that'll be the primitive brain making the decision rather than you thinking actually, is this the right thing for me right now? Or is this a good thing to do as a an honorable thing to do or whatever. So that helps us to make moral choices as well.

Speaker 2:          16:48          Okay.

Speaker 1:          16:50          So that's just to give you a picture of uh, the growth, the development of neuronal connections from a newborn to adulthood. That's, this is the adult one here. This is covered. So you can see the, the, the rapid development of connections that happen and this is healthy development where a baby is interacted with and stimulated. You see how those neuronal connections get made and how they become abundant because the more stimulation, and now I have to qualify this because we, we can, I don't want any of you going home and suddenly going to the library and getting 20 bucks and doing that sort of what to call that flash thing with your child, where you're showing them lots of flashcards. It doesn't work like that. The stimulation Ni as I'll explain in a minute, needs to be attuned to the baby. And that's the problem about going in with, let's give them more stimulation and then they'll get triple A's in, they're living starch when they're done.

Speaker 1:          17:55          It doesn't work like that. So the stimulation is important. But how does stimulate with comes in is really crucial because what we could do is we can overwhelm the baby's brain with stimulation and they could feel too much. And I'll talk about that in a minute. So let's have a look at this video or some of it just aware of time is going very quickly. There's lots of things I want to show you. So this is to show you the importance of social connection for a baby. Um, so the baby's speaking for themselves and it shows you what happens if that social connection gets taken away. So it's, it's an experiment that was created by psychologists about 35 years ago to try and get into the experience of the baby rather than trying to do lots of, you know, crunching lots of numbers, really very much a social, emotional, qualitative type of research. So any thoughts about that? Are using their phones? Phones?

Speaker 4:          19:02          Yeah, I think I'm using the tablets and all that kind of stuff on is they're saying no, the kids are trying to best to get your attention and you're just stuck in it. So I think that's what it made me think of.

Speaker 1:          19:12          Do you think about that? Yeah. Great. So we can get preoccupied is adults, right? And the reason I'm here is because people need to know this information and once you have inflammation you can be more aware, right? I don't blame parents for getting it wrong, but I think a good, I'm a parent and my, my son's one grown up now, but if I had this information 33 years ago, I think life would be a lot easier for him now. But we learn and we can only, what I say to the parents I work with, we can only work with the information we have at any moment in time. Our parents, some of us who are older were told, I mean my mum was told to push this down the end of the field and leave us in the fresh air cause would make our lungs stronger. So when we were crying, nobody heard us and nobody came. I've been in therapy since, so, uh, so parents, you know, are, might not be aware and might be distracted and work can be very demanding as all sorts of reasons why parents can get taken away from their babies and their children. So, uh, his, here's the, here's the science. Yeah. Anybody else want to comment on that?

Speaker 4:          20:34          I mean, apart from the parents kind of

Speaker 4:          20:38          shutting down in terms of reaction, what's the difference? I have two young boys by the way. I'm like, for example, in the mornings, so we're getting ready. It's a mad house and what we actually do quite regularly, okay. You know, there's an Ipad, whatever cartoon of the flavor of the month design in the moment, the two of them, two and a half year old and a one year old will, we'll shut up and watch the screen and they'll be happy while we, you know, get dressed and get out the door with them. Is there, is that different, does that, is that like, because it's not an actual human interaction, is that as as as ugly a thing?

Speaker 1:          21:07          So it's about the frequency of being in contact, out of contact. That's the issue. So it's not whether you do, I mean, you know, let's face it, as parents, you have to find strategies to manage. You know, you're a busy day. The demand, you've got to get out to work. That's the reality. Um, and so if you, if you use a video, you know, in the moment to help, you know, keep the children from, you know, running out the front door or are climbing the walls or whatever, that's, that's different from actually children who are on screens incessantly or parents who are on screens incessantly. I'll go on to talk about what it is about the social interaction that's so key. So, um, parenting just needs to be good enough. Is there a sigh of relief in the room? It doesn't have to be perfect.

Speaker 1:          21:56          And in fact, as I'll talk about perfect parenting, so called, there's not such thing, but her parents want to be perfect. It can be detrimental to their children. So, you know, uh, think about what I'm saying and then, you know, balance it out. Have a discussion and think, you know, is this, is this okay? You probably is. If it's only in a moment to get the job done. Yeah. Okay. So you, some of you might have been surprised by that baby's response. You know, I don't traditionally have assumed that babies were born with what's known as a, a kind of blank slate as a blank slate, Tabula Rasa, um, you know, like a computer that just arrives at your home. Uh, that's not been, uh, uh, what you call it here. Uh, programs. So that's the idea. You know, I, I'm not very computer literate. I have to admit.

Speaker 1:          22:52          Um, technology terrifies me most of the time, but actually it's very much, the previous thinking was very much like that the baby arrives like the laptop, the good comes in the post and I turn it on and expect to just to work, not realizing it has to be programmed. So we know now the babies are actually born with innate capacities for interacting and connecting, which have a profound effect on their development and how that's responded to. And just in case you think this is just a female phenomenon, I want to show you this. It's a bit a bit of this video. Um, because you know, traditionally women have been seen as the, as the important caregivers, uh, for babies and young children, but actually dad, so just as important, it's a bad relationship. It's not about your, your gender. Um, it's about the quality of the relationship you bring to this child.

Speaker 1:          23:51          So why not, what is it the parents do that builds that baby's brain? And we know from the research there are five main things, so five, uh, building blocks of the brain or a formula if you like, a different type of formula, power from their feeding formula, feeding the brain, uh, in this case so the parent responds, so a baby and a child will initiate when they want connection. So maybe connection just to play and have some fun. It may be connection for stimulation because they're bored or it may be connection, uh, because they want to be calmed down and suited and helped with their feelings because they can't do it for themselves. And so in order for a parent respond appropriately, what's very important is that the parent is able to read the cues of the baby or the child. Oh, I wonder if she's crying because she's needs a nappy change or maybe she's hungry, maybe she's bored.

Speaker 1:          24:55          Or maybe she's very frightened because there was just a loud noise went off next door. And that's really, really key. And that asks for your intuitive judgment. So your brain connecting with your body to help you to attune and empathize with what it is that the baby is needing. And actually for new parents that can take time, right? When you have first have a baby, it's like, oh my God, what do I do with this? Um, for all parents. But you get into the baby's rhythm, you get to know your baby, your baby gets to know you and you actually learn the baby's temperament, which is very important because no two babies are the same. And that's very important. If any of you have gone, if you go onto the internet to use parenting books because sometimes the blogs and the books will actually present stock responses for all babies controlled crying.

Speaker 1:          25:55          It's one of them when the child is older. Timeout. But actually if our babies and our children are individual, they will need an individual response, which is, uh, comes from the moment from you perceiving what it is that they actually need from you. So we need to notice the baby's needs and read those cues and then respond to pro APP as a CI tuned way as possible. It doesn't, again, it doesn't have to be perfect. And then the second element of, uh, what a parent does is to use contact. So for, for young babies, we picked them up and with color color them and we hold them a lot. And we know from research by the age of about six to nine months, babies start to need less and less, uh, picking up and holding, but they still need contact and neither us to, to, um, to give them cuddles, to comfort them when they're distressed.

Speaker 1:          26:56          Um, but as a child develops that, that need for a con consumer holding reduces. Um, and uh, and that physical contact, that touch is absolutely vital for the brain and the body to develop two to wire up, but also for those feel good hormones to come in. So we've got oxytocin, dopamine, Serotonin, dopamine is a very important hormone for learning and for, for focus and attention. And, uh, oxytocin, I don't know if you know, but it's labeled the love hormone. So we, we, we stimulate the air. We secrete oxytocin when we come into any loving or intimate contact with another person. So it could be a lovely experience with a friend. It doesn't have to be a romantic partner, but parents and children's stimulate the production of oxytocin in each other when they interact in joyful, a interactive experiences. Um, the other important thing about the touches actually helps us to, uh, learn to, uh, feel ourselves in our bodies.

Speaker 1:          28:03          And that kind of might seem a bit of a strange thing to say, but really a feeling embodied, putting grounded in your own body and connected to all of your organs. Because a lot of our emotions, uh, that our ability to perceive our emotions comes from our viscera. They come, the Vegas nerve passes right down from the brain into our vital organs, lungs, throat, uh, kidneys, stomach, and an order for us to be able to know how we feel and to be able to then communicate that we need to be able to perceive those emotions. And if we're cut off, my buddies weren't able to do that. So the third, uh, element of, of, of, uh, what up for the parent does to build the baby's brain is actually how they manage their own emotions. So a parent being able to regulate themselves are ourselves homework, upset, distressed, angry, that before we respond to our baby, we check how am I feeling?

Speaker 1:          29:07          Oh, well, I'm feeling really angry. Maybe now's not the time for me to deal with this. So maybe I'll get my partner to deal with it. And so it's just going to this slide to show you, it's the idea of securing your own oxygen mask before you secure. As you know, when you're on an airplane and they say, put your own oxygen mask on before you put on your chiles. And I've always taught that sounded counterintuitive. But when you think about it, actually you can't save somebody else unless you're actually protected yourself. So similarly with your own emotions, you can't regulate, um, uh, a baby or a child, a young child unless you're regulated. Because remember what I said about the neuro chemicals. Have they, uh, get, uh, triggered? How'd they get stimulated between us, between our brains, our two brains interacting with each other and our bodies too.

Speaker 1:          30:00          If we're angry or we're very anxious, then the baby or the child's neuro biological system will pick that up and those corresponding emotions will be triggered in them. So really paying attention to our own arousal levels, uh, and trying to calm ourselves down in order to be able to come them down is very important. And actually what's really key to know is that babies actually learn to regulate their, not just their emotions, but their whole rhythms, circadian rhythms through the physical holding from the parents. I met, I met all of these five things actually for particularly the physical holding. So when a baby cries, a, that will trigger some discomfort in new quite naturally as parent because that's nature's way of making sure that you don't sit and continue watching game of Thrones on TV, that you actually respond to the baby. Otherwise you might not.

Speaker 1:          31:00          So we are made uncomfortable, which propels us into responding. And then what happens is as we hold the baby and we start to calm the baby and sued the baby are Razah level comes down and the baby finds out, ah, that's how you calm down. This is, oh, that's very interesting. Obviously not because babies don't have condition yet, but the baby's system learns. It's a training procedure. This is how you calm down. Watch Mommy, watch daddy as mommy and daddy calm down. The baby's system gets that information and over and over and over, true time, the baby's system, a babies rounds of system, you're a biological system. Brain body is able to do that for themselves when they get, it's a stressed, anxious subset. So does that make sense? So we don't, we don't, we're not born with the capacity to emotionally regulate. We have to learn it.

Speaker 1:          32:02          And we learned it as babies and young children from the adults around us regulating themselves and then showing us how it's done. You can imagine if a parent, you know, and you all parents get angry, I get frustrated and get anxious. That's quite natural. But as long as it's not continuous and all the time, then that's not going to have a detrimental effect on the child. But, um, you can imagine being around somebody who's very angry all the time. What does that do to you? What does the, how does that make your system fail? I not just talking about your thoughts, but also your whole big, what does that feel like?

Speaker 1:          32:44          Would you imagine? And not food. He might feel threatened and undressed under attack as a, put you one kind of defense in a defensive mode because it's, what's happening is those stress hormones are cascading round your body because there'd been triggered by the other person's level of emotions. And that's why it's so important that we're really thinking about it on regulation. Uh, as we're looking after our babies and our children and of course each other, because similarly you will have a similar, uh, experience with a partner of friends. If they're constantly disregulated, then you're going to pick that up and you're going to feel that. And then the fourth component of what pens to is clay now playing, we all know it's a good idea to play with the child. But here we're not just talking about in know, playing together, playing a board game together or uh, reading the mystery or, um, playing a board game. We're talking about right from the very beginning with an infant, the face to face interaction that happens between parents and child and how that has a huge impact on how the brain connects up. So when you see a baby and you go to interact with a baby, what do you find yourself doing? Have you noticed if some of you might not have been around a baby recently, but what do you notice yourself doing? You lean in. What else do you do? You smile, you make, well, they don't think they're silly. I don't think they're silly, but we start to make these noises. He sounds, what are the, sounds like?

Speaker 1:          34:36          Does anybody want to do a demonstration? So you raise the pitch of your voice. Very important. What else do you do?

Speaker 1:          34:51          Expressing you become more expressive. Your face. You saw that mom when she may engage, she was very animated. So you and you look excited, interested and excited. Very important. You start to intimate your words, you elongate them. Um, and you do a rhythmical voice. Oh No. Could you, aren't you so good today? Has Anybody talked to the partner like that? Believe me, I had some people living in my house once and they did and it was really irritating, but mostly adults. Dope. But we'd find ourselves as an innate drive to do that with babies isn't interesting because it's called infant directed speech in, in science. But we talk about parenting. These are baby talk. But it's so important because it's the building blocks of social interaction. Babies learn. One had to make eye contact. They learn how to turn take. So I have a goal. You have a goal. My turn. Your turn. What, what is that important for?

Speaker 1:          36:08          Having conversations where people, social conversations, do you know people who don't try and take very well? Yeah. Um, so that is very important because it helps us to connect the timing. All of that needs very precise judgment. And babies learned that from their parents doing that face to face. They also learn about how to read other people's emotions. So if I'm looking at you and you look sad, no, you're doing it right there. So if you're a baby, I might sit all that and what I do as a parent, as an adult, if I'm emotionally attuned and I'm an empathic, I'll display that emotion on my face and then we'll get reflected back to you. And what I'd be saying too is I get it. I get it. You're really sad. The baby feels great when that happens, as opposed to, Oh, you look really happy.

Speaker 1:          37:08          The baby's like, no, I'm not. But they can't tell us that. But they might cry because we didn't get them. That's called misattunement. So when we do that, oh, you look so sad. We're giving them the information about that emotion. This was what's sad. Looks like you're sad. I'm resonating with the emotion. That's the empathy. And I teach my child how to understand their own emotions, how to read other people's emotions and how to develop the vocabulary. Sad. So now I have a word for sad because my mommy and my daddy tells me what's sad is, Oh, if you're not coming with the feed quickly enough and the baby's crying. Angalee and my said, oh, you're really angry with mommy or daddy, but you're not angry when you're saying that. But you're helping the baby to understand what that emotion is. All of that and much more comes from those face to face interactions, which are so key.

Speaker 1:          38:10          And then we have talk, which is the conversation, the words, the language. And you can see how these are all interlinked. You know, we do all of these in the blank for now. We don't break them down and say, right now I'm going to talk to you. We actually do everything we, we look and we go on to. So beautiful. We start to use the language. And we use the, the infant directed speech because that is, gives the baby the basis of language. It's cold, they're cold protal conversations where we're having this conversation. You make a sound, I echo back the sound to you. Like you might say God got guys, babies often say not yet but it's coming. Um, and so I was attuned. Parents do is they reflect back the sun, the mirror, the sand back to the baby, go, go, go. And that is the building blocks of language teachers, a baby about the social, particularly the social aspects of language.

Speaker 1:          39:06          But there's so much more in there with the play in the top because it says your really important, you're a valuable human being. You are deserving of my time and attention and my focus and I'm really interested in you. So the excitement is a really key part of this. The animation, because I'm saying to my baby, I so interested in, in you and I really love interacting with you. You failed that and that affects your physiology. It affects the babies for the physiology and your mirror each other. And that is a perfect storm for communication. This works well.

Speaker 3:          39:41          Is there any science around the, uh, uh, affect that younger siblings? Yeah, because I, my third child definitely got way less than my first or, or even second child because you're so busy. Yeah. Yeah. With the other older ones. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          39:56          Yeah. And I was nine of 12, so I know what you're talking about. Um, yeah, I guess it's difficult when you're, the more children you have, the more your, um, demands there are on your resources, your intention, your focus, your time, your, uh, you know, your capacity or energy. That's the hard thing about being parents. I've been having a number of children. Um, I don't know specifically about research in relation. There's lots of research on sibling. Uh, I'm on birth order. Um, and you know, there are differences, uh, in relation to that. Um, but you know, when I want you to go away with is knowing this, but also knowing that, um, children just need enough, you know, we need to be just good enough as parents. And one of the problems currently it's called helicopter parenting, where parents are so hyper anxious about being good enough, they're actually hampering their child's development.

Speaker 1:          40:56          So you know, this is why the first three years is so key because you're building the foundations of a house. I was creating the structural foundations, which then the house gets built on strong foundations and then you'll have a strong house. So as children, uh, we know from the research that, um, children need to start cutting amount to have babies even needs a certain amount of challenge to be able to learn to be resilient. So when mom stopped talking to this baby and the baby got upset, that wasn't damaging for that baby. It would have been if mom hadn't come back. What happened was the baby started to use their resources to just see what was going on with the baby. What would they, what was she doing?

Speaker 1:          41:50          She was trying to get mum back. So she was raising her hands. They played the game. So in her memory systems, there's this game, this work before this has helped us connect. Um, she points, she does a number of things and then she does something called amplification. She starts to increase the intensity of her communication, her voice and her body language. Because if you're not getting it, the child, you know this, I mean have you have young children, they will up the ante. And that's because it's so terrifying to be disconnected from your parent and you're, you're afraid as a small charge. You don't have the, the, uh, mechanisms to be able to think, actually daddy's gone. But he's coming back. I mean, that takes some time to develop that on that security and that understanding or daddy's going to never got to talk to me again.

Speaker 1:          42:35          Fear is of abandonment and of losing a parent's love. So, um, important to know that resilience is built from a certain amount of challenge. So what Phil's resilience for this child is that she is trying these different things to get mom back and then mum responds and that helps her to feel masterful. It helps her to feel I can have an effect on somebody else. See what I can do and my mommy's not paying attention to me, I can get mum back. So what's important is that it becomes predictable, um, that the parent has read the baby's signals or the child signals and accurately and emotionally attuned. Oh, I'm sorry I was there somewhere. I think my head was somewhere else. I'm sorry I wasn't listening to you. What did you want to tell me? Isn't that what we do as parents? And so it's not coming back in and really acknowledging the child's, uh, effort.

Speaker 1:          43:33          It's all you really wanted to get my attention. That helps the child to feel, yeah, I could get my money back and my dad did back. I can make things happen. So what's important is the repair is the reconnection between parent and child. So, you know, if you lose the connection temporarily, that's okay. It just needs to be repaired. If you shout at your child, would you will do cause you're human. Yeah. Right then, I'm sorry I shouted at you mummies. Uh, you know, having a bad day today and I shouldn't have showed them sorry for doing that. That's what builds resilience, not the fact that you're never shatter your child, but that you shouted and you repaired. So we're just about to finish. Um, but that, that uh, what I was saying, yeah, you're right about the stimulation. Assimilation needs to be in tune. So as you're interacting with your babies or your child is reading their body language.

Speaker 1:          44:32          So if we're bombarding them with flashcards because we want them to do better in English, I'd leaving cert and there are gone of cringing and tried to pull away. That's a communication that they're overwhelmed. It's too much, it's too difficult. Um, so constantly reading body language and the cues that are given off so that we can actually work out how much to engage, how often for how long, um, is the most helpful thing. And as I said, well, it's really empowering for a baby. The small child is that they know they have an impact on you. If they try to connect with you and you respond, that's very empowering. If they lose you when you come back, that's very empowering and that is what builds resilience. So Dan Siegel lose an American psychologist, a psychotherapist says, we now know that the way to help a child develop optimally is to help her create connections in our brain or whole brain adaptive about skills that lead to better relationships, better mental health, and more, uh, meaningful lives.

Speaker 1:          45:36          You could call it brain sculpting or brain building, whatever phase you prefer. The point is crucial and trilling as a result of the words we use and the emotions we take, children's brains will actually change and be built as they undergo new experiences. And that leaves a positive note that the brain is plastic for life. Very important for somebody of my age to know that. But we have periods of growth and proliferation and so we reorganization between about 11 and 24 but the brain can change, change the experience of the outside world and the brain will change, change the way we interact with children and their brains will change. Thank you all very much for this.
