Speaker 1:          00:09          Yes. Um, I'm Andrea yet and I've worked all my life and um, job has had a, required a certain degree of numeracy, so a lot of stuff in it. I'm a lot of stuff in insurance and I've always regarded myself as there's a numerous person and I suppose this whole project came about from frustration and seeing the way numbers are handled in the media and in politics and in public life in general. And it seems to me that, you know, set your teeth on edge sometimes some of the stuff you hear and you read, um, and the way that numbers are handled and sometimes this, it's matters of sovereignty and the way in which they, they, the, the um, the things are presented. Sometimes it's very, very basic. Sometimes there's just a question of people not understanding what the scale of a certain problem is and small issues get magnified.

Speaker 1:          01:05          Large issues get, get, get, get minimized. And it got me to thinking that sometimes it's the question that just needs to be asked and answered is, is that a big number? And so I as one dice these days, I set up my website and the website had one function only. And that is, it's a single input field. You can type in a number and press a button that says, is this a big number? And it goes and we compares it to a whole bunch of reference numbers that it's gotten a database and it comes back and says, yes, it's 10 times the diameter of g of Jupiter or something like that. You know, it's, it, it, all it does is it goes back, retrieves the number and brings up some, some pleasant entertaining comparisons. But doing that work, maybe think about the way in which we regard numbers, the way in which we relate to numbers of way in which we understand numbers and big numbers in particular.

Speaker 1:          01:57          Um, I'm thinking about it when I started writing some of this down and tense the book, which you see here. So today it's all about numbers. It's not maths, it's about numbers. And the way in which we think about and relate to numbers. Um, I mean you guys Google, you're the monsters of big data. But today I want to talk a little bit about what you could do with just a little bit of data and not with high tech processing of data, but just the stuff that you've got in your head. Just thinking about numbers and thinking about how we relate to numbers and how we understand numbers. So how numbers help us understand the world. Now you may think I'm being metaphorical there, but I'm not. I'm going to start a fire literally talking about the size of the earth and I was always told that when you do a talk, I guess you started with the ancient Greeks, the ancient Greek era Toscanini's.

Speaker 1:          02:50          Now you may know him because of his connection with prime numbers. [inaudible] the way of filtering out the compound numbers, leaving behind only the prime numbers, but he was much more than that. He was in fact the third chief librarian at the famous library at Alexandria. Um, and put yourself in his position. He's there. This is a relatively recent institution, been founded off to the conquest of Alexander, the great 200 BC. The scope of the world has, his world has expanded because of this. And he's dealing with new information coming in from all over the place and he's trying to assimilate this information, who's trying to manage it? He's trying to pull it into a form of a framework. He's trying to aggressively collect this information and deal with it. Does that sound familiar at all to you guys? So there he is. He's running the library in Alexandria and he's trying to make sense of the world and he's using numbers to do this.

Speaker 1:          03:53          Now that's a not that he made. What's a reproduction of a map that he made of his known world and he's known as the parent of scientific geography. And while we may look at that map and think that's a little bit dodgy, um, it represents only about an 8% of the globe as we know it. Um, and it's seriously deficient when you get down to the south, you'll find that that word over there on the bottom says he quite huh. Um, and he runs out at, at roundabout India over to the, to the, to the right there. And let's forget about what's going on to the west. But that was his known world. But there's a lot that's going on in the trial. So you can see around the Mediterranean basin, they are some familiar shape, size and stuff. Let me put yourself in this guy's position.

Speaker 1:          04:39          He doesn't have surveys, he doesn't have telecommunications, he doesn't have measuring devices. He's pulling this from, from stories. Um, and the thing that he introduced here, all of these lines of latitude and longitude. So what he's doing is he's using numbers to put these things into the right place. Now the two points that are particularly of interest here, that's where he is in Alexandria. They on the Nile Delta and down below down south is a place called [inaudible], which has a, if you can read the word that says tropic, it's on the tropic of cancer. And that means that that on the summer solstice in Cyan, the son would have been overhead. So that is what he used to measure the earth. Now that's not just an ease, it's called Sagan, but he's showing you the technique that we're tossing is used. So you can see their insight in there has a colon and they're up in Alexandria. There's a column. Now when the sun is directly overhead and so, and on the summer solstice, the column costs no shadow. The Sun shot shines directly down a web shop or we've chuffed well shaft. Um, whereas in same day in Alexandria, there is a shutter that's being cost. Now this is because of the curvature of the earth of course, and that let him calculate the size of the earth.

Speaker 1:          06:08          Geometry. Of course, it comes from the Greek. Everything comes from the Rick, well not everything, but it's a measurement of earth OLED. So he's measuring the earth units each using or feet, how days. And if you like footraces the stadium was the length of the stadium and has run 200 meters, um, in, in today's terms. And he had a measurement there from Alexandra to of in 5,000 stadium. If I look on Google maps, I see that's approximately 850 kilometers. So you can get the equivalency. And of course we understand geometry in a different way as well as, um, shapes and styles. And sizes and so there's a bit of geometry for you. There's some parallel lines coming in the rays of the sun in the southern location inside [inaudible] you can see that it's pulling directly in line with a column there. Up in Alexandria there's, there is a shadow being cost and if you're under your geometry from school, that angle there must be the same as the angle there.

Speaker 1:          07:14          So if he measures the angle in Alexandria, he can work out what proportion of the circle of the earth that represents and he mentioned it to be one 50th multiply the two together and you've got 250,000 stadia in our terms about 42,500 kilometers. Now that's pretty accurate for the time and for the techniques. That's very accurate and there are a couple of things I just wanted to point out here. One is that he's using very simple mathematics to do. This is only a few data points that he needs. Secondly, he's got a big picture. He's got a view of what's going on. He's got a concept of what's going on here that he can put those numbers into. And the third thing I would eventually, it's quite a subtle point, you know, in a way we saw his map of the known world, 8% of the globe. So that was all that he knew about in terms of places and peoples and things like that. But he also knew that the world was at much big, so he knew how much he didn't know. And I think that's an interesting thing to think about.

Speaker 1:          08:24          Now. We jump forward some 1600 years to a fellow called Toscan Ellie in Florence. It's also an astronomer. He's also a mathematician. He's also geography. He was one of the guys behind the development of the mathematical theory of perspective in the renaissance. Um, he was involved in the building of the Duomo in Florence and he's all set dealing with a flood of new information because this is aftermarket Marco Polos, wages just to the east. And in fact, he spoke to the first merchant aftermarket, hello guy called Nicholas [inaudible] and he got stories from the sky and he was also trying to assimilate this information and pull it together. And he too made a map.

Speaker 1:          09:10          And when he looked at his map and when he thought about this, he was convinced that you could reach east by sailing waste. And guess what? He sent that map to Columbus and it's an app for the Columbus relied upon. Now they're in orange. You can see what his map looks like and behind it you can see what reality looks like. And I think you can see the problem. He thought that the ocean between Europe and the east was about 130 degrees of the globe. In fact, it's about 210 degrees. There was a whole chunk of earth that was missing as far as he was concerned. And of course the rest is history. Um, Columbus ended up in the new world as he thought of it as a time.

Speaker 1:          09:55          And in fact, that's what Dustin Lee wrote. The ocean to be crossed is not great. Therefore, by bringing up at, or the Asiatic coat is easily reached. Well, numbers make a difference. Yeah. So are tossed and A's around 40,000 Tuscan, alien, Columbus, we're working to around 30,000 or 25% difference. Now it's easy to romanticize this and think of the, the ancient choirs all ancient being the guy who got it right, but you've got to admit there's some dodgy numbers floating around there. The 5,000 stadia exactly. The one 50th of the globe. Exactly. You know, maybe he'd got lucky, but still he got the right answer. Well that, you know, and, and, and, or something close to the right answer. So, um, so there's that to be said. Now if we look at what the actual measurements are, we get some tune on this there, one around the equator of one over the poles and a slightly different, but they're both very, very close to 40,000 kilometers.

Speaker 1:          11:00          And you may think, well that's a bit dodgy. That's a bit close to around number and of course that you'd be absolutely right. And that comes from the definition of the original definition of the meter, which is one 10000000th of the distance from the pole to the equator along the line gangs for Paris of course. Um, and now we start getting into numbers that are not to do with body parts and how long you can walk. You're talking about measuring the globe and the numbering system that's derived from scientific measurements. And we start getting into what we might call big numbers. Can, I'm just going to take a moment now to think about what do we mean by a big number? What makes a big number?

Speaker 1:          11:47          You know, 40,000 kilometers around the world. 350 million. A lot. A number. We've heard about a lot if you want a few years. But very seldom is it Austin, is that a big number? Um, seven and a half billion people in the world, you know, is that a big number? And I think there's a gap in our society and our understanding and the way we think about numbers here. So we go to school, we learn about numbers, we learn to count, we learn about bigger numbers on that. We're going to hundreds, we go perhaps into thousands. We've become very familiar with numbers in a fairly limited range. So I mean there's an example highest ever single leanings test crickets call 952 runs for six declared, um, India versus Sri Lanka Columbo, 1997 and I can imagine that number building up. I can imagine sitting and watching that mansion, there'd be a six Nebia fall and there'd be a couple of singles and slowly that number would accumulate.

Speaker 1:          12:49          I can grasp that process that takes me to that number, but it's almost slipping away from, it's almost a thing, whites, it's a big number in those terms. And now you have, on the other side, you have these young scientists working in the lab. And for them a big number may be a very different thing entirely. They may be thinking or taught about regardless. Number in a 6.02 times 10 to the 23 the number of mole, the number of carbon, 12 items in 12 grams of carbon. That's a very big number. 600 billion trillion. And when I start saying billions and trillions, they've got to be careful not to trip over my words because this is where confusion comes in. And of course the scientists use that notation, scientific notation and that's fine. They learn those techniques, they learn those, those algorithms for working with those numbers and everything is fine, but not everybody thinks in those terms.

Speaker 1:          13:46          And not all numbers I expressed in those tournaments. And in between those two there is a gap. And we talking about numbers that relate to government now miss at relate to corporations and resources and populations. And these numbers are beyond the thousands. They're into the millions, billions, trillions at, you know, I have to watch myself even now talking to you, not to say billion when I mean million or trillion. And it's, it's confusing. And I don't think any of us really grasps numbers very well in their cap. We've got a good, a good understanding of small numbers. We've got techniques and dealing with very big numbers, but that's only techniques. It's not really a a relationship with those numbers, but in the middle there are some very, some important numbers. They are important because we're called upon to make decisions based upon those numbers.

Speaker 1:          14:38          So what I'm going to do today is rarely try and just focus on one of those numbers, the global population there, the last of those, and just try and bring that to life for you in in a, in a, in a simple way. I'm going to stop by saying how big is a billion or we all know how big a billion is it to the thousand billion since 1974 in this country, you know, 10 to the nine one was nine Zeros. Are they going to put it? We'll know where to begin is, but can be. Imagine a billion. Can we conceive of a billion? We're going to get there. We're going to start with how big is a thousand I wanted to make this come to life for myself. So I found out my kid at university and I said can I play with your Lego? And I started building a lego strip.

Speaker 1:          15:23          There you go. It's the start of it. 10 yellow, 10 whites, 10 [inaudible], 10 white trying to build a strip, a thousand Lego studs long too wide of course. Cause that's how it comes. And they would guys, I'm going from outside the house into the house. You can see my toes sticking into the picture there. And so I go and I build that strip and you can see in the right in the middle of that I'll put a little red brick just to mark the point. There is another, another year of it. Now forgive me for flooding in this, but I'm just trying to put us in context. So I'm just trying to give you a physical idea of what thousand looks like compared to one one in a thousand a thousand to one ratio. And there's the whole thing. And then as you can see, I've numbered that up to prove it to myself and there's a little brick in the middle to show you the the one compared to the thousands.

Speaker 1:          16:16          Now it's also the length of vendor denial compared to the Oxford. Cambridge breadcrumb is 6,800 kilometers versus 6.8 kilometers. It's also a height of Kilimanjaro compared to pole vault record. It's also the height of Niagara Falls when measured in pools. So just trying to give you some field, well, you know, a thousand w w we treat, it's unlikely we dismiss it so easily, but it's actually quite a big number. It's at, if you look at your screen, you know one in a thousand this is maybe one or two pixels on across your screen. It's, it's, it's a thousand is a big number. But we had to build up to a billion. Now to build big, we need to start small. So even start with a tiny little ledge, just a four millimeter antenna and that's our starting point. But we get an hour and he just stick to something a little bit bigger.

Speaker 1:          17:08          Maybe we want a beetle, there's your beetle. And just luckily that happens to be about a thousand times bigger than the Andrea. So I imagine a thousand ants lined up alongside that Volkswagen beetle. Now in another step, what's going to be a thousand times bigger than a beetle? Well, it turns out in central park isn't a bad, a bad choice just to have a four kilometers and very conveniently it's set in a place where they numbered the streets. So the 50 street blocks there from, what's the time 60th to hundred and 10th street, that makes 80 meters per, and you can imagine 20 beetles on each block of New York bumper to bumper jammed up all along central park west there, the thousand cars. And perhaps you can imagine each of those cards has got a thousand ads next to them. So now you've got a million ants going there.

Speaker 1:          18:08          Okay. So far so good. What's a thousand times bigger than central park? Turns out Australia is not a bad kid. It's just over 4,000 code does east to West. Your gold maps coming to my rescue there. Um, so that's a thousand central park's stretching across Australia, coast to coast. It's a million vehicles. Then it's a billion items. So a building that's cross Australia, but I can't resist going one step further and closing the circle because if we know that a thousand or 4,000 kilometers is within Australia, we also know that 40,000 is he a crater? It's a 10 billion is going to take you align the brands all around the world circling the earth.

Speaker 2:          19:02          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          19:03          A little deviation. Now how fast can recycle. Yeah, no, I don't know how good your literate, uh, literacy yet. Literature yet knowledge has, but there's an itinerary from, uh, from her book and we're going from the London regarding via Hong Kong. You're going by a San Francisco, we're ending up back in London and the giveaway of course is the title there of 80 days. So this is a planned itinerary and Jules van's book around the world in 80 days. That's how I feel. Yes. Fogg plan to get around the world. And the, how he calculated that he could make it work the, a map of the route that he took.

Speaker 2:          19:50          Okay.

Speaker 1:          19:50          And the two things that interesting about that to me, one is that it's, my name is a straight line or even a great circle. It's um, you know, he's, he's having to do a fair bit of zigzagging, especially around about southeast danger there. Um, and secondly, it's actually all almost entirely in the northern hemisphere. So the southern most point there is Singapore, which is pretty much on the equator. Um, so for two reasons, well, there's, there's two contracting forces here. One is going longer than 40,000 because he's going the zigzags and he's getting shorter because he's actually going in the northern part of the earth. So again, Google maps came to my rescue. I measured those sort of point to point distances on some key points there. And actually it comes out not far off, 38,000 kilometers. So I reckon that was all right. So he do around the world in 80 days, steam and rail was his, what was driving him there.

Speaker 1:          20:54          Now, Eric tossing, these would have known that you could walk around the world with about a thousand days if you had a right, of course. Um, we can drive a bit faster than, than that. Last year a fellow called funds for, uh, um, a copy of the thing. I'm not afraid to say that and did a trip around the world. Um, Gabba Francoise Gaba, I did a trip around the world and they'll try Moran took him 43 days to go around the world solo. We commercial flights, you can do it in two and a half days. And I checked up on this, you can take any New Zealand from London to Oakland, Los Angeles in two and a half hours on the ground and in Oakland. And you can take a BA flight back via Sydney and Singapore and it takes you exactly 60 hours, two and a half days. A plane has actually a B 52.

Speaker 1:          21:45          Obama has actually flown around the world in 42 hours refilling on flight. I'm the fastest play in the plan is a blackbird re complain. It didn't actually go around the world. It's, it did a 24,000 kilometer journey, 60% of the way in about 10 and a half hours. So that would have been equivalent to going around in 17 and a half hours and the International Space Station of course goes around about every hour and a half, so about 15 times a day. But then I came across one more measurement that I couldn't leave out, which was from Shakespeare and he said that he has puck saying midsummer night's dream. I will put a girdle round about the earth in 40 minutes and when I saw that 40 it chimed with my 40,000 so there's a thousand kilometers admitted, one mega Meta permitted. I think we should have a new unit of speed called a pack once mega liter per minute.

Speaker 1:          22:44          Anyway, that's a bit of diversion. Yeah. Let's talk about the number of people that th th th the seven and a half billion people now you guys, I'm sure it will know all about this guy called Hans Rosling died. Sandy last year. Swedish doctors, statistician talk, her thinker, Wonderful Fella. If you've not seen his videos or read his book fact for this God and get it, it's it's, it's a fantastic, fantastic book. And He, this is him talking about the world's population. And in the first picture there he showing 7 billion people as he had at the time and the age distribution of these people. So you've got 2 billion people under the age of 15 2 billion children, 2 billion in the next traunch up to the age of 30 and then a billion, a billion, a billion going up to 75 and he's talking about the wine which population grows and the way in which it's a predictable thing.

Speaker 1:          23:40          And he says what's happening now is that the number of children is not significantly increasing in the world. What's happening is that people are getting older and so those columns are growing upwards but the whole structure is not getting wider. So he's taking it there from seven to 10 billion by aging. Those pop, those, those, those, those young people. And that is a change of pricing in the world and how it is the way that the population is progressing and it takes a little bit further and he says, yes, people are going to be living longer and he's putting another block on top of there to make it into 11 billion. Um, and that would cover the age 75 to 90. This is obviously a very crude and simple terms but nonetheless it helps you to focus the mind. It helps you to think about these numbers. Um, in, in the background there he's got a little chart based on the United Nations projection and he talks about having reached peak child. In other words, for several decades now the number of children in the world hasn't been increasing. What's happening is that adults are getting older, more people are living to old age.

Speaker 1:          24:48          And I mean there's a whole discussion to be had and the whole discussion around all of the implications of this I which one to pick out one thing here and that is around 2050 around the middle of the century, we are going to pass the a number of 10 billion people in the world. Whether we go beyond that, whether it be for, you know, when we uh, whether it tops out. We're not talking about that yet. Now just a question of at some point we will hit 10 billion and what will that look like? Now we've already got a reference point for this. We've already covered this because we know what 10 billion ads look like. It's a 10 billion ants wind their way around the world ones. Now I need a bit more space than an ENT. If an ant gets four millimeters, maybe I need a meter. So Ryan of people would then be 250 times as long with wind around the earth.

Speaker 1:          25:45          250 times. Can we visualize that? Let's take some central parks. If we put 10,000 central parks around the world, central park is 850 meters across. It's enough space for 250 lines of people and three meters between them and that would be 1 billion people sitting in each park. So 1 billion people in 10,000 parks around the world. Is that realistic? Well, yes. I'm showing my age here, but in 1981 silo and Garfunkel reunion concert concert, they pulled 500,000 people onto the great lawn in central park and that had bigger crowds in that instance then. So there we are pushing towards a million people in central park. Is that realistic? Yes, it is. To think about that. How do I numbers agree? Yes, I do. Just a little few validity checks and we can be, we were happy that we were in the right order of magnitude cal.

Speaker 1:          26:45          How dense are those people? It works out to about 300,000 per square kilometers and that's the direction. Now obviously we're not trying to say that all the people in the world can convert at that density, but how densely can people live? Well, the place on earth with the greatest population density is Macau. I'm sort of the sister said you to Hong Kong on the China Sea there and they've got 21,000 people per square kilometer. That's only 15 times as much as those profilers in central park had. Um, so it's pretty dense, but you can see there is some um, green space. There is a working city of a viable city. It is a viable way of living. So let's just do a thought experiment here and say what happened? What if all the world loves a densely as they did in the cow, how much space would that need?

Speaker 1:          27:40          Well, 480,000 kilometers squared squared. Now you can see what I've done. There are factories that into my favorite number, 40,000 by 12. So you can imagine that as being a ribbon said he stretched around the world only 12 kilometers wide. So think about this remote, even from the center of that, you could walk six kilometers, what's it, two hours walk and you'd get to the edge of this, the city. And there would be nothing between you and the Paul. Of course, there'd be farms, it'd be everything that we need to, to sustain ourselves. But in terms of people, we could put everybody in the world into 12 kilometer wide strip around the world. But of course we don't want to live at that level of density that they live in Macao. Um, you know what, for good or for bad, we've chosen to live in, in England, um, with the density is about 420 per square kilometers.

Speaker 1:          28:44          So that's about 50 times as much space as the inhabitance of MCI. And those 10 million people would need around 24 million square kilometers. And again, factorized that 40,000 by 600. And so we get there, say a belt nation there. So a country, it's about the same north to south as the length of England. It's about the same as Ecuador, which is on the equator. Uh, and again, it's, you know, that would have space for the lake districts and the national parks and the cities and the suburbia and no more than 300 kilometers, half a day's drive to get to the edge and nothing between you and the poem.

Speaker 1:          29:31          Now, I'm not going to suggest this is a practical plan, but it's just to get these ideas in your head of how much space it takes up. Here's another way of expressing it is 80% of Africa, everybody in the world could live in that living at the density that we live in England. Of course I'm oversimplifying like crazy. Yeah. Um, and you know, 10 billion people. Is that a big number? But of course it is. It does. The world of space for 10 billion people. Well, of course it does. But that's not that simple. You know, we've, we've, we've not talked about distribution of people. How are we not talked about the food that they need, the water they need, the waste they produce, the what is needed to give those 10 billion people meaningful and fulfilling lives. And

Speaker 1:          30:27          Rarely, I'm not sure to tell you that's, you know, 10 billion people is not a problem. Of course it is. There are massive problems, but until he start measuring the problems they become, they are very hard to deal with unless you can actually start putting numbers to some of those ideas. You don't have a chance of actually dealing with any of the issues. And all I could quote from Isaac Asimov, great science fiction writer, if knowledge can create problems, it's not through ignorance. So if we can solve them, so what solutions they come, we will, they come from, we talk about the 10 billion people when we think in terms of problem, but 10 billion people is also 10 billion minds to think of solutions. It's also 10 billion people with inspiration, with determination, with drive. And it's people like you who were, those solutions will come from it. Smart people, it's people who are practical, are problem solvers. As people who think it comes down to it. For people who are numerate, those are the people who are going to get to grips with the issues and deal with them. And,

Speaker 2:          31:51          yeah,

Speaker 1:          31:54          and it's not just the techies. It's not just guys like you who can grasp the problems and deal with them. But there needs to be a political will and the people with political power and people with political, with financial power also need to be on board to make these things happen. And they need to be persuaded and they need people to spend it. Sometimes not through big data, but sometimes through little data, sometimes three little points that they can focus on that they can latch on to, that they can invest in their minds. And it says this communication aspect, I think that is very important. Um, you know, the reporters and the journalists of the world, they'll to sensationalize sensationalizing sometimes. And it's a question of trying to ground these and trying to bring these issues to a measurable levels where we can think about them.

Speaker 1:          32:40          And sometimes it's complex and sometimes it's simple. Sometimes it's as simple as asking the question, is that a big number? And rarely that simple question is what's behind what's in the book. Um, I talk about various ways of getting numbers in perspective. How do you compare numbers, ways of thinking about them as there's lots of sort of visualization and there the stories about numbers. Um, and it's a question of getting our brains around and being able to express as numbers in ways that are meaningful and those that are useful to, to uh, to people. Um, and yeah, so let me up. That's the book. Um, there's a website, is that a big number.com? I'm Andrew [inaudible]. I'm also, I've got a Twitter feed there. Um, those of you who have picked up a copy of the book, I hope you enjoy it. Um, and if anybody got any questions, I'm happy to answer.

Speaker 3:          33:46          You say it's important to get a grip of numbers and understand and put them into relation, uh, big numbers especially. Um, how do you suggest we help people do that? Um, because lots of people, probably all of us struggle with very big numbers and putting them in relations.

Speaker 1:          34:06          I mean, I've talked through in the book various techniques. The top one, the landmark numbers is one that I think is very important. What I mean by landmark number, it's something that you, that sticks in your brain, you don't set out to memorize it, but it sticks in your brain as a reference point. And I hope that all of you will leave knowing that 40,000 kilometers is the length of the crater. Um, and that can be a reference number. So you can, when you see that you buy, um, you know, Australia is one 10th of that African north to south is one fifth of that. It becomes something that's in your head that you, is it a ready reference for you to come through to, to, to relate to. And the seven and a half billion people in the world and they're, you know, these are numbers which if you have them ready to hand, they help you to make these yardstick comparisons against things that you hear about. And it may be budgets, it may be populations. It's stuff that when you hear something on the new juice, you're saying, hold on a minute. That's not a big number because it compares with that number in this way. And that's, that's, that's one of the techniques. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          35:18          Um, you were saying that on your website you have like a database of numbers you compare it to. Yeah. Can you tell us what some of them are? I assume one is the 40,000. Yeah. That's where I come from. All sorts of things really. I mean it's, what I tried to do is to find numbers that would make meaningful comparisons. So some of them are just sort of re routine households or everyday objects like the size of a post it note. Some of them are things like, um, you know, landmarks, the height of the empire state building or the height of the height of the Eiffel Tower with the ACA. And one of the things that I, I, that is on the website and in the book is I try and find passive that is not, is that comparing an interesting way? So for example, the empire state building is 5,000 posted notes.

Speaker 1:          36:09          Hi. You know, almost exactly. I do the comparison to [inaudible]. Um, and you get some really interesting, interesting numbers that come through and that has a, it's an interesting function because it makes you think about the numbers themselves, but it's almost like a triangle. You know, he has the empire state building, he has a posted note and he has a number 5,000, and it gives you a little bit of a feel for each of those points of the triangle. When you think about them in that relationship. Of course it, it, it means nothing in terms of if, you know, there's no conspiracy theory here that they designed it to fit the posted note. Um, but it's, it's still studying at sticks in the mind and that's an interesting way of going about it. But yes, at the numbers, the numbers on the website, off our things, like at the length of the light Nile river, you know, the population of Brazil, there are numbers that you can compare things to. Um, um, and, and that, that's something that may or may not be intriguing when you bring, when you see them.

Speaker 4:          37:09          Thanks for the talk in the book. So it seems that most of the things you've talked about, at least so far, I don't live in the book, there's more, but it's like about physical quantities that you can kind of compare it, like look at one versus the other. What do you think, do you think that the same strategies apply to think things that are more in material, like information and so on. Like maybe a few years ago, like thinking in megabytes would have been fine. Now we're talking gigabytes. So maybe it's a different, like it's almost like unbounded, uh, in a way, like the, the kind of a amount of numbers, the size of the numbers that these things are. So you think,

Speaker 1:          37:44          so the first book is a book is it's more physical things around us, you know, it's white and it's Spanish, isn't it? Things like that. Second off of the book first gets into certain numbers from science. So we'd talk about how you can visualize or start to grasp, for example, the size of the observable universe. You know, get there by stages, you know, um, and there's a chapter on inflammation and regarding going to things like, um, how do you measure information, that's all, you know, how to information is contained in texts, how information is stored in physical devices and things like that. Of course that part of the book is out of date before it's published, but nonetheless principles remain. Um, and then there's a chapter on mathematical numbers as well. Um, it's really not a book about mass, but we have to touch on things like um, you know, explained that that infinity is not actually a number on the number line or you're talking about grams number, which is an interesting, he made a few grams number.

Speaker 1:          38:41          Yeah. I mean it's, it's, it's a, it's a non both. Um, I first came across it when it was in the Guinness Book of Records as the largest number ever used in a serious mathematical context I guess. And Grimes number is just a recipe for taking pallets of numbers and unbelievably large number of times you could not write down Graham's number, the world, the universe would not have space for it. Um, so question is, you know, is it even a number if it's all that it is, is a, an algorithm for, for, for doing computation red you could never carry out. Um, but actually even if I, you know, going buy a coffee and it cost me two pounds 50, that number two pounds 50, it's just an algorithm. It's not the number itself. There are some digits there and we are heads of the algorithm for turning that into a number. So there's no point of principle difference between the two.

Speaker 5:          39:35          Thank you for the talk. I have a question because I mean my family, like half of the kids don't understand math. You know, I was fortunate to understand it a bit, but um, do you think this like understanding numbers should be, have a bigger role in school because how math is taught in Germany for instance? Still Very, you know, basic. Yeah. And very on the numbers rather than on what the numbers mean.

Speaker 1:          40:02          I think there's an interesting thing job cause I think, I think math is a thing of beauty. Math is math is a, is an abstract thinking skill of all subtlety and profanity. Um, and what we call what I called numeracy. Of course it touches on maths, but it is not math. It's dealing with numbers. It's the way in which those abstractions of maths connect to the real world. Yeah. And I think, I mean I'm no teacher, I'm an educational expert. I can't speak with authority on those matters. But it seems to me that we leave behind numbers due to live on two maths. And I think that some of the things I've been looking at Yarra suggest to me that there's much more that we can do in terms of what I would call adult numeracy, advanced numeracy to actually think about numbers into the millions and billions and trillions.

Speaker 1:          40:59          And there's a shift that happens. I mean we all, when we start thinking and at junior school we're thinking in terms of linear numbers, linear scales. But truthfully, the interesting stuff happens when you start looking at more like logarithmic scales. When you start thinking of things in terms of, of multiples of each other. Um, and when you, the way to understand things like the size of the university, you can't do it if you're thinking in terms of a linear scar. You've got to think in terms of what is of magnitude in terms of powers and so on. I think there's that sort of numerous thinking. I don't, I'm not aware that that's part of the scope of our, of school mathematics and I think it's actually very important and it's very useful to think in terms of, of, of, of proportions rather than linear scales. Thank you again.

Speaker 2:          41:53          Thank you all for your attention.
