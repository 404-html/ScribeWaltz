Speaker 1:          00:07          Dr Lila hatch from Noah with the s, uh, the marine ecologist with Stellwagen Bank, which is off the coast of Massachusetts. And we have Katie more program director at the International Fund for Animal Welfare. I'm a biologist by training. I'm the director of the Animal Rescue Program at the International Fund for Animal Welfare, which is actually headquartered on Cape Cod. Um, and

Speaker 1:          00:32          in relation to this, um, part of my job is to direct our marine mammal rescue and research team, um, which is based here on the Cape and responds to strandings basically from a Plymouth south to the Rhode Island border. And, um, we have, uh, the unique privilege of being in an area where we have regular mass strandings of marine mammals. Um, usually, uh, pilot whales, Whiteside of dolphins and common dolphins on Cape Cod. And it's one of the three top hotspots globally for mass strandings. Um, and what makes us a little bit different than, than some of these other places in, for example, Madagascar in this case is that, um,

Speaker 1:          01:12          mass strandings on kid caught up, been happening for centuries and you can go back into pilgrim logs. And actually read about masterminding. So we know that the events here predate the industrialized ocean and predate a lot of this noise. And so they're considered kind of a natural mass stranding and we use them kind of as a control group. Um, for comparison to other groups. Um, what has developed in is very different. Um, in terms of what we do now is part of what we do in our response is actually to test the hearing of the dolphins that strand in our area. I'm a technology we didn't have in hand when the stranding happened in Madagascar. And so that's, um, kind of a new advantage we have to getting some background data, uh, in terms of mitigation. And we actually use sound to our advantage in some cases, um, using acoustic deterrence to drive potential groups of animals that will potentially mass strand in our hot spot areas like Wellfleet and other spots and Cape Cod bay, and using it to actually, um, drive animals further off shore and prevent them from stranding. So in some respects we're using sound to our advantage. Um, but that's where I stand with it.

Speaker 2:          02:21          Um, I, uh, um, have a variety of where a different variety of different hats working for the federal government on this issue. Um, um, the National Oceanic and atmospheric administration where I work, um, manages, um, a national marine sanctuary, which is the vast majority of Massachusetts Bay right off the shore here. And our mandate is to protect all the resources of that site, which include, um, uh, very rich populations of fish and marine invertebrates. All of us, many of which are acoustically sensitive and active make, make sounds. You sound very actively. And the famous cod for which we call Cape The Cape Cod is an incredibly acoustically, um, uh, active fish makes sounds when it spawns, uses those sounds to organize it's courtship behavior. So this is a, this is an issue that is way richer than marine mammals and the whales. Um, and, uh, so I work on a research program, developing a research program, um, to look at what the influence is of, uh, underwater noise that humans produce on this wealth of species in the sanctuary context here.

Speaker 2:          03:37          And then the majority of my time now actually I spend trying to work on our agencies, many, many legal mandates for um, improving protection for marine a marine life and our mandates stretch from a lot of the things you saw references to a in some ways in, in, in that we've done, we've passed laws in the 70s that protect marine mammal populations above other populations. Um, and we, um, uh, have particular mandates to protect endangered species and then we have additional mandates to um, ensure the sustainable ability to harvest fish and marine invertebrates in fisheries. And all of those diverse mandates are part of Noah's portfolio. And um, usually they include inability to protect populations or understand the influence of human stressors and noise is a big part of that portfolio, increasingly large part of that portfolio. So I work on the agencies development of a new, a 10 year vision for how to get our arms around the fact that noise is increasing at this exponential rate.

Speaker 2:          04:47          The fact that it really does challenge a lot of the legal mechanisms and his scientific mechanisms, we have to address it and to try to make sure that over the next decade we're in a better position to, to address this issue. So that's, that's sort of what my task is. Oh, and when you wanted us to talk a little bit about mitigation, right? Mitigation, um, uh, it is an incredibly rich topic. I won't go on for a long time, but I'll just sort of touch on. You heard the influence of sound talked about. Um, in fact, Katie, you did a really nice job of in the film, you know, reminding people that there are, um, sometimes we make it into two categories, but really it's a little richer than that, but to at least two ways that we consider noise influence. Um, and one is an injury, direct trauma to ears, either temporary or permanent loss of hearing or in really extreme cases, um, uh, death to the actual animal just due to trauma to the physical, the animals physiology.

Speaker 2:          05:53          Um, then there's all of these adversive strong adversive behavioral responses that can lead to mortality is which you heard a lot of reference to. That's not trauma to the, it can include trauma to the ear. If indeed the animal in responding, um, goes through these, these decompression Ben scenarios or they're adversion winds them up on a beach, then you can have mortality. Um, so there's these extreme behavioral responses and then there's an enormous gray zone of things that are way, way more difficult to get on top of. And that you may think of as associated with a lot of different environmental issues that we deal with, which is sub lethal impacts, things that don't kill the animal. Um, but that we get concerned about happening to them repeatedly in their lifetime or happening to them chronically in their lifetime. So mitigations, there's a suite of mitigations that we've gotten better and better at, um, to address those lethal conditions, especially for marine mammals.

Speaker 2:          06:52          Mechanisms for first off, trying to reduce the co-occurrence of animals, doing something, anything actually anything at that close proximity that will lead to any kind of lethal interaction. Um, and that includes ramping up a source more slowly and some conditions that's effective in some did conditions. It's not the most effective thing is to reduce, to use everything we can to understand where animals are. It's not an easy, easy task. And to, um, have the activity described and in such a way that they're not going to do it in that space and in that time. So restrict activities in, in time and space to reduce their co-occurrence with animals. That's the, that's what in the prime mitigation techniques associated with these acute effects. Um, and it also starts to get out of some of these additional sub lethal influences of, you know, an animal may not have such an adversive reaction that it winds up on the beach, but it may have its feeding disrupted and you may not worry about that if it happens once.

Speaker 2:          08:00          But if it's in a location where there's a lot of activity that's disruptive and it's during a really important biological activity, um, like, um, this is a really Kunsthalle a lot of marine mammal populations have very constricted feeding times where they're focused on, um, uh, patches of prey that are in that space and time and need to be, um, they need to be efficiently Eaton. And if they're getting disturbed, there's a caloric effect on, you know, just reducing the fitness of that animal, reducing their ability to get the calories they need. It's a very odd, if you think about what a whale is, it's an extremely odd evolutionary phenomenon to have the largest animals in the world dependent on eating a gigantic amount of the smallest amount of animals in the world. And that's, that was all built at the whole thing works because of the relative predict, uh, predictiveness of an animal.

Speaker 2:          08:53          Being able to find those concentrations and being able to take them in quickly. And so if you mess up their ability for them to, um, uh, use that header heterogeneously distributed resource the way they have to, they don't have a lot of access to another evolutionary mechanism to make up that bad amount of calories. So these are these sub lethal sweet and that doesn't even get to the thing that I actually concentrate on the most and that I'm, the reason that in the film I concentrated on shipping, which is that hum in the background and the hum in the background is something we're really just starting to understand for humans. So you can imagine why it's a difficult thing to get regulations to understand for marine critters, which is if it's simply a louder in the background, what are all the different kinds of signals that animals are dependent on hearing that they now lose access to.

Speaker 2:          09:47          And we're so focused on whales as communicators between each other and their signals. So there's, the first thing we think about is the loss of the ability to hear each other. And that's what we're talking about in the film in terms of right whales being able to hear each other calling, what are the ramifications of that? But actually what we know from terrestrial wildlife and birds, all these other critters is that, um, they're using all kinds of sounds and the natural environment to detect, um, where's a good place to settle, um, to hear echoes over very large areas of space that tell them something about, um, the, the, the conditions of the, the bottom that will tell them about the predictability of food resources. Definitely the ability to hear predators, the ability to detect, pray and all of these, this is a really, you know, the sound is a really ecologically rich medium underwater.

Speaker 2:          10:38          And being able to detect those cues has been really critical. Trying to figure out how to mitigate that gets to working on quiet or technologies, you know, working at the scale that's relevant to chronic influence of noise and the buildup of these industries. And so we work, um, uh, we've been working a lot at the international maritime organization, which is a part of the UN, which regulates worldwide commercial shipping and got them to pass at the first voluntary guidelines for quiet and commercial vessels, things that come or that the countries that are party to the UN and that are party to this. Um, these guidelines can begin to figure out ways to put in place. And that's one of the first ways you bring an environmental stressor issue into that, that global business. And we're working on those same types of issues with air gun industry, you know, with the oil and gas industry and with the possibility of bringing vibroseis into commercial, a widespread commercial use. And so these are, those are the, some of the things we have to get at for chronic influence. So was anybody designing more efficient, quieter ship propellers for the commercial traffic?

Speaker 2:          11:48          Uh, yes. I mean that the efficiency of a, of a commercial propeller has something that the shipping industry in a lot of our meetings has said we'd, you know, we've been working on this for a long time. It's not like we haven't been trying to build commercial propellers, but the pressures on the industry now are greater than they have ever been. Um, because, um, the sh the global shipping industry has to come into compliance for carbon missions at a level that they never have had to. Um, and within the next five to 10 years spectrum, they have different milestones they have to reach. That's the biggest design, um, of design pressure that's been on the, uh, on new builds for 50 years, other than maybe twin hulled to reduce, um, uh, issues with ballast and an end. Um, um, uh, uh, exotic, uh, you know, the introduction of invasive species.

Speaker 2:          12:42          That was another huge design moment for shipping. So the question now for us, it's going to be how much of a noise gain do we get from that pressure that this greening moment in, um, carbon emission design. And that's been the biggest pressure on what's a model basins, which is where conglomerates of shipping mostly in Korea, Japan, I'm a little, you know the a relatively large one that we, that was spoken about a little bit in Germany, but there are, that's where most of that design work has been and it's usually on the combination of the hall and the propeller and then there it always has to do with operations, so it's this, it's just this triple linked thing. It's, it's the propeller design linked to how the hall is built in, in, in, in combination with a propeller design and then the third component of is it actually going to be used to the design specs that will result in the efficiencies that that it was built

Speaker 3:          13:41          for. But I thought the issue with propeller design, you've got the efficiency and this quiet at the same time as the cavitation. That's the problem that costs us a noise and causes a loss of efficiency of the propeller.

Speaker 2:          13:57          It's interesting, I have to tell you that there would be other voices up here who would be from the industry who will be saying it's nowhere near that simple. There's whole sectors of shipping and PR and propeller use. Um, they have to do with which engine is where power is paired with which propeller. Um, that would say that it's not a direct linear relationship and um, that it has to do with a variable. There's a kind of propeller called variable speed propellors that are in some kind of use and you know, so, uh, it, it's just not a completely direct relationship. Others say that. Overarchingly and I think that's, some of the statements that are in the film I think are, they're hard won over several conferences to get to a place where we feel comfortable saying, yeah, but there's a big wind there that's still potential for, um, that said and understanding how to match that with where we want to be.

Speaker 2:          14:50          Um, you know, ships have an 40 to 50 year lifetime. So we have to figure out how to deal with existing vessels and retrofits are not going to be possible at the design level. And so we're going to have to build better ships. You absolutely. And there's that. That build is probably going to be pressured not only by noise if we're lucky, but by the sort of green ship of tomorrow holistic design package that gets at the regulatory pressures that are coming down the pike. And then we have to figure out how to operate the ships we have now is mostly what it's going to be to get their noise profile down.

Speaker 4:          15:27          Let me ask you about the other two main sources that the film talked about. Uh, one is oil and gas exploration. So what is the, what kind of progress, if any, is there in, uh, oil companies and gas companies adopting, uh, these lower frequency or less invasive, um, exploration technologies, number one, and number two is the navy and sonar. I would imagine that, um, where the navy is going to be going in the future with sonar and related technologies is probably highly classified. Uh, but do you have any information on or have you been heard anything from the navy or from other countries, navies about, um, the possibility of adopting technologies in the future that are less damaging

Speaker 2:          16:18          in the oil and gas community? There had been sectors, um, uh, well the major, the major oil and gas, um, worldwide companies had been investing, had been the prime investors since the 70s in some of these alternative technologies like marine vibroseis. So they're not a new phenomenon. Um, there, um, and that investment has indeed been from the industry. Um, the implementation of that is this constant dance between, um, it takes millions of dollars to outfit a geological and geophysical surveying vessel. And the fleet that's out there now therefore has an enormous amount invested in the current technology and the areas of air guns that are being used. Um, so figuring out, um, and the, the, the bureau of Ocean Energy Management, which a part of the, uh, department of the interior and that directly regulates, um, geophysical exploration. And then subsequent oil and gas development. Um, Noah works in very close partnership with, um, that bureau.

Speaker 2:          17:27          Um, our job is usually to help that bureau. It has its own mandates to figure out environmental oversight and has its own mechanisms by which it could incentivize the development of those technologies. And we don't have that direct line. And Noah, our job is to evaluate the impacts and to um, authorize, um, a level of impact if we can find it to be negligible on some populations. So that assessment, we have a lot co-invested in the assessment realm and we absolutely have been part of governmental. Uh, there's a, an industry I'd called the joint industry, uh, Prom Joint Mr program that has developed an entire marine vibroseis s three stage, heavily invested by Exxon Shell, BP, all of the companies program to, to try to see if they can get to, um, vibroseis in use in context and really do a proof of concept. All the way from the build.

Speaker 2:          18:28          So they have three companies who went in to show them that they had these mechanisms and they're taking them through the various stages of real industrial development. What I hear from industry is that as there's never going to be a complete replacement, but that's the way they talk about it right now. Um, but that there will be conditions under which we could see a lot more use of vibroseis. So I think we're definitely in a slower, slower or in a different place. We're in a, uh, an um, uh, we're, we're walking forward. Um, and you know, sometimes it's a little bit, two steps forward, three steps back because the oil and gas industry goes through its own economic stages in which it's more progressive and feels like it has more resources to fund the next stage. And this is not that time, oil and gas industry. So, you know, these things go in ebbs and flows. Um, the u s navy, um, I'm, uh, I'm not as privy to what a future technology or replacement would be for sonar. And, um, that's not something I can speak to. Um, but there has been, um, a lot of work, very close work between Noaa and the navy to develop mitigation programs over time and space. And, um, I think I'll leave it there for now.

Speaker 1:          19:46          I can speak just to the last little bit with the navy. And it is definitely true that there's a, um, there's a lot more focus on the navy to really comply with standards. They have to have their permits in order now and they have to have, um, impact statements ready to go and have evaluated the impact. And in that there are mitigation measures built in when they're doing exercises. The other piece of that is, um, Noah is the, the permitting agency for all of the stranding that works around the United States. And so I'm working through Noah and in conjunction with the navy and being prepared with protocols and knowing when exercises might be going on in certain areas so that we can be prepared to, um, to deal with the strandings but also to document what might be happening and it can trigger a shutdown of what they're doing depending on what comes up. So at least there's a lot more communication, which I think is a huge step forward as well. Um, I've been an environmentally concerned

Speaker 5:          20:48          citizens since I was this high and I had no idea about the issues with sonic pollution in the sea. So I think maybe the most important way the public can affect the outcomes positively for the marine mammals and other animals is to just know about it. So, uh, how can we help promote this message? And once it is more, um, I guess known about what can the public do to affect this?

Speaker 2:          21:14          It's really great questions. Um, and uh, it's, it's interesting, you know, the, um, before this movie was made and this movie is not going to obviously save, save the world, right? It's not going to be the end of the, and really an important need for outreach, but it has, um, promoted a lot more dialogue. You know, we, just to give an example, we recently put out a document that was really Noah kind of talking to itself about how to do this work better. So we decided not to really do a press release about it, but we really did want the public to know we were doing it. We got over a hundred thousand comments back on the document and it was covered on, you know, in the front second page of the Washington Post. So that would not have happened without this movie happening over this past year.

Speaker 2:          22:02          And without a lot of concurrent, um, outreach perspectives. I actually am somebody who has worked on Naval Sonar, um, uh, assessment issues in, in, in, uh, some past phases. And I've been concerned with the disproportionate attention to enable sonar relative to a lot of other sources of underwater noise that I feel are having really strong effects and that we are less prepared and have less of a history with developing mitigation and developing dialogues with, with specific industries. So I've, um, I that has, that has been the largest, uh, outreach. Um, and the largest messaging, the most pervasive outreach and messaging around ocean noise issues has been around a court cases and navy sonar. And, um, I have been pleased to see that even some of the same groups that had been carrying that message for so long are part of now making a film that is saying this is actually not an issue about navy sonar.

Speaker 2:          23:06          It's much more holistic than that. It's much more deeply ingrained in the way that animals use this environment and the, you know, many sources of sound that can contribute to it. So it, it's been a combination to me of figuring out how to tell a a story about sub lethal impacts under of any nature is tricky. Having worked with CBS News and having them come to me and say, but the shipping noise thing isn't it killing them? And you, you know, you know that he really wants you to say yes because that's the story and the answer is no, it's making it really hard to be out there, but you sure it's not killing them. Yep. I think it's, you know, so again, we have to tell a complicated story and, um, and we have to keep telling it. Um, I think what we've said to people is that they're, so at Noah where we have a lot of different outreach perspectives.

Speaker 2:          23:58          We have 14 sites that were um, our, our version of national parks off shore, um, that are these national marine sanctuaries. There are good storytelling media. Um, and we have very large local constituencies that are often very engaged in these places off shore that are there. And Marian, you know, your and our national marine sanctuaries. Um, we've started to increasingly engaged them and telling the ocean noise story where you started to increasingly engage them and putting recorders there and having live streaming of sound from these places so that people can start to get at this sensory medium that is this place. And we're often asked the question what can I do? And um, it is a tricky one. It is. I think being educated about it, understanding it as part of the balancing act we do surrounding how we move goods around surrounding. And how you, how you as a purchaser, um, can consider this as part of global transiting of stuff that yeah, I'm, that we all buy that is something that we've talked about. Um, and um, other than that is part of very large decisions about energy offshore energy development that we can do, um, smartly we can, that we can do in, in the, uh, with pressures to do it very intelligently and thinking a lot about marine life. Um, I think that those are the ways that we, the messages that we've started to develop the most and make them place based where people can start to attach themselves to them because people are often very attached to particular ocean more than they are the ocean.

Speaker 1:          25:36          I think from a nonprofit perspective, we do, part of what we do with all of the different issues that we face is trying to get the public aware of it and giving out the right information and making sure good science is out there to inform really good policy development. Um, I had a really interesting conversation last night with someone who was talking about the fact that the, the size testing that was going on in Madagascar prior to that stranding was a multibeam echo sounder, which is kind of like what you'd see on anybody's boat. I mean it was industrial sized one, but it was like what you'd use as a fish finder or depth finder on your personal watercraft. So when you start thinking about the number of vessels that are on the water and how many people have these as part of what's out there now, granted that's a very small scale and not very strong.

Speaker 1:          26:25          Um, but I think an awareness of, of everything we're doing, you think back to, you know, seventies and eighties and the, the ads about not littering and things like that, that was kind of this revolutionary movement. It's a similar kind of thing and awareness of the impact that we have as individuals. And then I think looking for those opportunities, we get to the point, you know, certainly at a national level and looking at legislation that can help, um, regulate this in a meaningful way that, that supports the kind of work we all have to do. Whether it's national security or having the goods that we need, but also protects the environment. Um, you know, and then looking at it and finding ways to support that. But also we have to think on a global scale. And that's where it gets really difficult for me is processing noise on a global scale.

Speaker 6:          27:14          So, um, I had, uh, written professor Christopher Clark with a question and he actually wrote back during the movie. So I just read his response, but I want to ask you to the same question and first style. I'll read his response. I wondered about the role of citizen science and he wrote for Marine Acoustics, we're still in the embryonic stage. The number of people recording in the, in the ocean has increased dramatically. And the challenge is not data collection so much as it is data processing. For example, the bioacoustics research lab norm routinely collects the equivalent of somewhere around 120 280 years of raw acoustic data every 12 months. And we have to search through all of those using various auto detection algorithms, most recently on high performance computers. And there's lots of tech, no discussions that could follow on this one. So I wish he were here to tell us more about that. Um, but he says it's, it's like where's Waldo and needles in haystacks within haystacks. Ah, but I wonder what a, you two could say, not just in acoustics, but in general about the role of citizen science in any of these.

Speaker 1:          28:27          Hmm, sure. Um, vital in many respects would be my answer to that. Um, we at the international front in front, I'm a welfare and most stranding networks around the country and around the globe for that matter, rely on volunteers. So the general public to come in and it's not just a matter of come in, pick up a dolphin, help us get it back in the water. It's come in and help us collect data, help us pull it together. And trying to utilize, a lot of times we have people that have retired from incredible careers that have this skill set that they can bring to us, um, and really give us some additional benefit that we wouldn't necessarily have expected. I think that the other, the other piece of citizen science, you can see there's different programs around the world. I know of one in Australia where they're looking at a lot of oil and gas exploration and development and there's not that, some really remote places along the coastline and they actually set up a great program.

Speaker 1:          29:25          I'm part of it was through Duke University in getting, um, boaters and coastal folks to report sightings and take photographs. I had this great app that they had and you could take a picture and send it in. And so they were tracking, um, presence and absence of different species of marine mammals, the coast to try and develop a data set that didn't really exist. Um, and it's a much less expensive way to do that. Then trying to get a survey vessel out there with paid observers and all the things that you need to do that which still needs to be done. But this gives that, um, an added layer of data they can come into it. So I think there's a huge role and I think as we go forward, a more informed population gives us the opportunity to engage more people with an interest to do more of that work.

Speaker 2:          30:10          No, I think I, uh, I think that covers a lot. I mean, the other citizen science programs I was thinking of were very similar in terms of integrating, um, integrating citing information. Then those have been powerful. And you, the, the base, the basis of mitigation development is knowing where animals are. And it's a huge, huge, huge task to describe, well how animals use the environment in a way that you can then prevent overlap. And it's the most powerful way we have of reducing influence. So getting citizens engaged in that effort is, is really, um, has it, has a lot of potential.

Speaker 7:          30:45          Okay.

Speaker 6:          30:45          And I personally also have a more Katie more oriented question, which is that I'm very curious about the incidence response that you do. Like how do you hear about something? How do you organize a response? What's it like to go there? What is the follow up?

Speaker 1:          31:02          Well, local responses easy comparatively. Um, thankfully, um, folks on Cape Cod and in the areas that we respond a really keenly aware of what's supposed to be happening in the water in front of their house or on the beach in front of the house and what's out of the ordinary. And so we get a lot of reports, early morning beach walkers, things like that of when a seal or a dolphin or whale might be either swimming close to shore, out of habitat or up on the beach stranded when it comes to responding outside of our normal like response area here on the Cape, it's a lot more challenging. When we got the call from Madagascar, it just so happened that this stranding took place during a meeting of the international whaling commission so big. So basically every big whale biologist on the planet was concentrated in Santiago, Chile, and they sent out a plea for help do a handful of folks.

Speaker 1:          31:53          And um, within 20 hours we were on a plane on our way. We met our colleagues that we had never met before on an Air France flight going from Paris into Madagascar. And, um, it's a really difficult, difficult thing to do to respond in real time globally. Um, you know, the animals that we see, the less time they spend out of the water, the better when you're talking about a dolphin or a whale. And so our, one of the keys to our success here on the Cape is how fast we can get there and how quickly our local volunteers that are trained can get there before us if it's in their backyard. Um, when I first started out with mass stranded animals, if we got to them and they were still alive when we got there, they had about a 14 chance of surviving. Um, and now we're upwards of 80%.

Speaker 1:          32:44          Um, just because of the techniques. We have lots of experience volunteers, we've learned a lot over the years in terms of how to treat the animals, um, both from supportive care and medically. Um, we don't have that advantage when we're talking about flying around the world and taking two days to get there. So we're limited in the kinds of responses we can do. But basically we'll get, there will be a call out from, you know, it can be another nonprofit or a government looking for help. I think one of the best things that we have going for us is how small the world has become because of the way we can easily communicate with one another. So information is shared so rapidly that they can call out for help and you can get folks, um, on the road or at least informing. We share a lot of information online and over the phone to try and get teams locally, um, able to respond in.

Speaker 1:          33:33          One of our projects we're working on now actually with Noaa and the Marine Mammal Center in Sausalito is, um, an international stranding response tool kit. So basically it would be all the resources you need from what, what, figuring out what legislation you have in your country to what permits you need, who your partner should be, how do you get funded, how do you recruit a volunteer, how do you get trained, um, and what are all the protocols you need from a to z. Um, and the goal would be to have, um, folks around the globe that we know are kind of already qualified in all of this. They're already helping us develop it internationally and then have them be the initial trainers. But the goal is to train the trainers. So we're training people on the ground, then develop networks in their areas and share what they know with their neighbors. So would just continued to grow on its own and be this free resource that would help kind of solve some of these emergent problems or you have to be really, really quick and response. So that's, I think the longterm solution is there.

Speaker 2:          34:30          Thank you for, um, uh, providing the opportunity costs for, for showing the film here and, um, for, uh, becoming informed about this issue. And, um, I could make a, um, uh, uh, give a shout out to, um, some of the things that are happening from Noah this summer. Um, we are, um, working on releasing are a final copy of this 10 year vision for how the agency is, um, uh, looking to improve the way we address ocean noise. And that's at a website called set sound.noaa.gov and there's a lot of information there about what we do and um, the draft that we put out that got a lot of public comment and um, feel free to reach out to us and there's our information is all in that site.

Speaker 1:          35:21          I would say thank you as well. This was a great chance to come and share a little bit of what we do. Um, and I guess my request would be share what you've learned and share your enthusiasm. I think that goes a long way. Um, if you're really interested in marine mammals and doing some volunteer work and doing an aquarium has a fantastic stranding response program as well, and sea turtles as well for them. Um, and we do down on the Cape as well. So everybody's always looking for a volunteer. So if you're willing and able
