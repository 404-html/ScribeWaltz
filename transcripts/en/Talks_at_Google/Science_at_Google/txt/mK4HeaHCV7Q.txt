Speaker 1:          00:00:05       I'd like to start by introducing our speaker today. So Dr a preamp not to Raja will be telling us about things. So tell you a little bit about her. She grew up in the Deli area to academic parents. She attended MIT. You are, she was awarded degrees in physics and the mathematics after that. If you did her graduate work in theoretical astrophysics at Cambridge, and she's currently professor of astronomy and physics it, yeah, in a professional life you've been a word of tons of awards. You've looked them up on the Wikipedia page or on her page. I'm not going to go over all of them right now, and she's given a Ted talk on the same kind of thing. She's here to talk about today. So I think you'll agree with me that she's seriously knows her stuff. When you were young, maybe like me, you looked up at the stars, kind of wondered what was out there free. The wonder that too. And she's gone a lot further to actually find out what's out there and map it for us. Like Bilbo Baggins. I love maps. I love for math puts mine to shame and she's worked hard to bring us some good maps of the cosmos. Slept. Please give a warm welcome to Priya

Speaker 2:          00:01:06       [inaudible].

Speaker 3:          00:01:12       I wanted to start out by reading out a quote that inspired me to write this book. I had always been, um, since I was an undergraduate, I was always interested in the history of ideas and in history and philosophy of science and in particular the process of why is it that some ideas take a very long time to be accepted radical ideas and why is it that some of them are the accepted very, very rapidly. And so what is the difference and why and you're not. And I came face to face, um, with this question, I actually come face to face with it almost every day as a working scientist because, you know, there are papers that I write, um, that I think, you know, it's a cute idea. It's um, a very nice idea and it sort of syncs without a trace. And then I write a paper that I think, um, he's okay.

Speaker 3:          00:02:07       And Do, you know, it's cited a hundred times, 200 times growing rapidly as we, it's always intrigued me what that process is, right? I mean intellectually what the process is. And so that motivated me to actually pursue graduate study in the history and philosophy of sign, which I abandoned because I loved science are so much more. Um, and so let me read this quote from Karl Popper and the logic of scientific discovery that will give you a preview of what my particular take is on mapping ideas. So on bold ideas on justified anticipations and speculative thought. Our only means for interpreting nature. Those among us who are unwilling to expose their ideas to the hazard of reputation do not take part in the scientific game. So it's ballpark in the logic of scientific discovery. And so, um, what I want to do today is to take you through a journey of, of acceptance of two very radical ideas in cosmology.

Speaker 3:          00:03:12       So our cosmic view has been transformed in the last hundred years. In the early 19 hundreds, we did not even know about the existence of other galaxies. We thought the Milky Way was it right? Uh, in Copernicus's time, which was probably the radical idea that set everything in motion that came afterward was the displacement of the earth and the sun. He moved the pivot of the solar system from the earth to the sun. And at Inco, panic is his time in the 15, forties, 16 hundreds, the entire cosmos was our solar system, right? And 19 hundreds, the entire cosmos, the early 19 hundreds, 1910, 1912, we only thought there was the Milky Way and that was it. Right? And so in the last hundred years, not only have we made enormous progress, as I'll show you a, in terms of our understanding of the contents of the cosmos, the properties of the cosmos, the timeline of the cosmos, and how, um, structure has formed in the universe, how we have come to be and our place in the sort of this grand scheme of things.

Speaker 3:          00:04:20       So as I mentioned, another sort of angle that I'm interested in is sort of the human and the psychological side of science. The fact that, you know, science is often represented as a sort of objective, um, people in the quest for some truth capital t wearing white lab coats and they're teasing the secrets out of nature. Um, and you know, it sort of really, and this narrative of how science is done writes out to both, uh, what I think are the rich motivations driving passions for scientists as well as the backstory of the humanness of the enterprise, which is the rivalries, the rush for fame, um, the emotional investment in ideas which you're not supposed to have as an objective scientist. Um, and part of the motivation for writing this book was also the troubling times that we live in. We live at a time of great technological growth of a grand convergence, especially in cosmology where the understanding, the theoretical understanding, the maturity of our theoretical understanding is extremely well aligned with the sophistication of our instruments that gather data and evidence and the advancements in computing that allow us to interpret, visualize the data.

Speaker 3:          00:05:45       So there's been a real grand convergence in the last 10 to 20 years in cosmology in particular. However, we somehow peculiarly find ourselves in the United States in particular in a climate where there's a lot of denialism of science and rampant a disbelief and science and the methods of science. And one of my goals, and I do a lot of writing other than scientific papers, is to try and explain the process of science because I believe that a lot of the denial of science comes from a lack of understanding of the process of science. The fact that science is contingent and it's provisional and what we know is best to date. And it's apt to change. When we have better data, we have more data and things don't change dramatically. Nothing gets appended from the roots every other day. Um, I mean, those kinds of transformations in our world view are rare.

Speaker 3:          00:06:41       And what really happens with every new piece of data that comes in that adds to, to our inventory and adds to our understanding is the ideas get refined more and more so in, um, in my book, um, I was obsessed with maps as a child, a boat, celestial and terrestrial maps. And, and I, and I tend to see and use maps. My own research work also revolves around mapping. As I'll talk about towards the end of the talk. And I use maps both as literal maps mapping is as mapping is knowing, um, as well as metaphorical devices, which basically encapsulate our worldview. So because when we look at precise, when we look at the 13 hundreds at 12, 12 hundreds, we don't yet have the reason structure of science, but what we have are ideas that get mediated, that distributed, that get contested, that are depicted as maps.

Speaker 3:          00:07:40       Then I'll show you some examples. And today I want to sort of lead you through two case studies of two concepts. And I written about many of them in the book, dark matter, dark energy, black holds the discovery of other planets, the discovery of the expanding universe. But today I'll focus on black holes and dark matter because that's sort of what I work on. So I have a site vested interest in sharing some of the latest results because I think, um, most of you here would be quite curious to know what the latest, what the frontier is right now. And so I'll be doing those two case studies. But before that I wanted to give you, um, set up context for how I'm approaching these, this idea of mapping. So if you look at the evidence that we have for the oldest maps, the oldest depictions of the sky, uh, it's the [inaudible] disc and it's a data to something like 2000 BC or so.

Speaker 3:          00:08:39       And this is a depiction of maybe the play these cluster, the crescent moon and the sun. And this is the first recorded image, if you will, that we have of, of the night sky. But the Mesopotamians were actually in veteran, um, charters of the night sky. So you also have, for example, this is an example from the collection in the Victoria and Albert Museum of the venous tablet is the cuneiform tablet. And Cuneiform has now been deciphered, as you all know. And so what these are, are the positions of the planet Venus. So what is remarkable is that they already knew the difference between a star and a planet. They knew, um, that planets will wonders and they didn't produce their own light and they charted them. Um, but remember they will not actually looking for an explanation. They were just doing phenomenology. They were just charting what they saw as a way of making sense.

Speaker 3:          00:09:36       And part of this was, uh, because they, there was no explanation for all this violent natural phenomena. Night and day, uh, thunderstorms, lightning, rain, floods, um, the, we're really trying to record and connect the terrestrial to the celestial, so happenings on the ground with what was happening and unfolding in the habits. So then when we move on to the 13 hundreds, there's sort of a shift in the search for some kind of explanation. Finally, some kind of agency causality for a why you have the phenomena that you have. So I particularly love this map because this is one in which the understanding now where was that? There are these two angels who are turning the crank. And that's why you get night and day. Right. And so, and then of course you move to, it was bright and Capitola the last of the greatest naked I astronomers.

Speaker 3:          00:10:41       It's at that time that people started looking for us explanation for celestial phenomena, the kind of explanation that we are familiar with a set of principles, a set of laws, uh, some description of the orderly cause moss. But, um, so this is another map, uh, you know, prior to peer review and um, uh, papers being refereed, you know, con contrasting ideas and opposing ideas were often depicted in these maps. And what you see here is a Riccio Yolie. I'm weighing two different ideas of the cosmos. One is the familiar Ptolemaic cosmos, which was very radical. And as with a lot of radical ideas, um, often it's easier to accept something that's sort of a halfway house model that isn't quite as far as the radical idea. And so this is an example where basically, um, you know, the earth moves around the sun, but all the other planets move around the earth.

Speaker 3:          00:11:47       So the sort of halfway house, uh, because um, uh, corporate Nicos is a rearrangement was a little too radical. And what's cute about this diagram, this, it's actually a front is piece of a book, is that you see Ptolemy, who his model has been discarded as an old man that's sitting underneath there, right? And you have, uh, also you have the one eyed argus who is looking through a telescope. So the telescope, Galileo by 16, early 16 hundreds has repurposed the spyglass and has turned it to look at the sky. And that was really the beginning of recording in much more detail celestial phenomena. And that already appears now. Uh, so the instrument's starts to appear in the, what would follow was an age where the interplay of ideas and instruments would kind of lead us to where we are right now. So where are we now?

Speaker 3:          00:12:45       So what we know, we know quite a lot about the cosmos at the moment. We know that, uh, they are universe started with a big bang, which is basically a very hot, dense state. It expanded. There was a period of extremely rapid expansion, exponential expansion called inflation, which lasted for a very short time. But then after that we've had steady expansion deal about five to 7 billion years ago when the expert, uh, when the expansion once again started accelerating. So we also know the sequence of events in the universe. We know that there are relics, Tomal relics of the heart universe that you see as the cosmic microwave background radiation. And then we have now uncovered the epoch when probably most likely the first stars formed. And we know the sequence by which, uh, galaxies form. And we also know the contents, the fate and the geometry of the universe are actually interlinked thanks to Einstein's theory of general relativity.

Speaker 3:          00:13:43       But the puzzling thing that we do know is that much of the matter in the universe is dark matter and it is most likely a set of particles that interact very, very weakly with each other. And therefore the only interaction is gravity. They do not Emmett absorb or reflect light. So there is no electro magnetic coupling. And the only way you would see dark matter is indirectly. But the interesting thing is the pie chart, which is the contents of our universe, is that the majority, the 90% of the matter content, which is the green and the scion wedge of the Pie, I'm 90% of matter is actually dark matter and the stuff that we are made of, the ordinary items, this stuff in the periodic table is only 4% ish. And, and of course everything other than, um, more heavier than lithium was synthesized in the centers of stars. So was synthesized quite late in the universe in terms of the timeline. So, and it also turns out that our current understanding, um, suggest that dark matter is actually in the driving seat of structuring the cosmos. All galaxies, all the structure that we see is seeded by dark matter. So now I yup, sure measure it's percentage. So it's a rub as intense. So it's energy. So it's energy, energy, density. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:15:16       So, um, what I want to do today is to take you through sort of the life history of two very radical ideas. And they're similar in some ways, these ideas. And yet there are quite a difference. So the two ideas are the idea of dark matter and of black holes. So they're both sort of invisible entities in the university are unseen and get, we can map them because of the, um, the effects that they exert around their vicinity. Right. And the difference between these two ideas is that dark matte, the discovery of dark matter was entirely empirical. So it was observations that suggested the need for a missing component as we'll just see. Whereas back holes where actually predicted there were a mathematical solution, the fact that they actually correspond to real astrophysical objects came quite late. So, and you'll see why there's sort of these observed mathematical objects.

Speaker 3:          00:16:12       Um, and it's hard to kind of imagine that there could be natural physical objects in the universe that would have the properties, the peculiar properties that we think, uh, black holes have. And so, um, you know, in a way the essential is invisible to the eyes, right? Uh, is a quote from the Fox in the little prince. For those of you, I'm a little obsessed with the little prince. It's one of my favorite stories. And so, you know, the human imagination, we've always been fascinated with what is unseen, what is unreachable, uh, what is just beyond reach, right? But there is a real checkered history for these unseen, um, fluids and elements, right? So, and during medieval times in pre-scientific, uh, times when they didn't have an explanation for a phenomenon, you always had some kind of invisible fluid that was invoked. So you had my asthma, you had flow just on before oxygen was discovered, and then of course you had ether, right?

Speaker 3:          00:17:06       So you can imagine immediately that when ideas, these ideas were proposed, that the board was very high and you know, the, the discoveries of these ideas held back and, uh, we're not comfortable with discussing what looked like growing evidence for the existence of yet another unseen entity, right? Because the other unseen entities have had a very checkered past, right? They've all been shown to be a humbug. So, um, what, so what I, uh, want to do now is to give you a sense of the history of the idea of a black hole and, uh, sort of leading into the properties of black holes and what we know today. What's the, um, what's the frontier today? And so black holes, um, as I mentioned, our mathematical solutions to Einstein's and exact mathematical solution to Einstein's field equations, he actually did not think that there could be exact solutions.

Speaker 3:          00:18:09       It was a complicated set of equations and he expected only approximate solution. So he was very stunned when, very, you know, four months after he actually presented his theory of general relativity, Carl's swaths child came up with this solution for, uh, for the black hole. But the idea of a black hole and the popular idea of a black hole is really that it's a point of no return because we all have an understanding of this event horizon, this region outside the black hole. We're not even light can escape, but there's a very interesting origin to that idea. So in Newtonian, in the Newtonian Universe, uh, he believed Newton believed that light was made of particles. He's corpuscles. So there was a very interesting, uh, scholar man of the cloth that John Mitchell, who was in Cambridge, who then cleverly came up with the idea that if you had a very massive star, it would just attract all the capacities of light and therefore not even light would escape and you would get a dark star.

Speaker 3:          00:19:04       So this idea of a dark star, a point of a place of no return even for light was proposed, not in terms of general relativity, but it really in a Newtonian universe. And the actual astrophysical use of this term, uh, was promoted by John Wheeler in the 1960s. And what really made black holds real astrophysical objects eventually, um, are the discovery of pulsars by bell and Huish and the discovery of quasars in the 1960s and seventies. But I was incredibly amazed to find that the concept of a black hole and the term black hole actually originated in Calcutta. It's an infamous prison and Calcutta where the Nawab, she Raja Dhalla in 1756 in prison, a whole bunch of offices from the east India company that was just starting to have colonial ambitions in India. And so they were imprisoned in the small cell, which was about eight feet by six feet.

Speaker 3:          00:20:03       And supposedly there's a lot of mythology about this, you know, several hundred soldiers were crammed into this and very few of them made it out alive. So this was a point place of no return. So it was a place and it was a place of no return. I said this concept pre dates, the mathematical idea, the scientific idea of the black hole. And in a way the storm was co opted from popular culture. So let's move onto what a black hole really is. So one of the easiest way to think about a black hole, there are a bunch of different ways and um, I'll, I'll try to take you through them. And they're useful when you want to under understand particular kinds of phenomena about black holes. So there's a notion of escape speed. So, for example, um, in order for, um, you know, when we launched satellites, uh, in order for the satellite to escape its gravity, you have to boost it to get it out of the gravitational field.

Speaker 3:          00:20:57       So for example, if you imagine the escape velocity from an object of a given mass m is, if that is the speed of light, that is the definition of a black hole. So basically you cannot, and as you all know, that speed of light is the cosmic speed limit. There's nothing that can exceed the speed of light. So one way of thinking about black holes are basically their entities who's escape velocity is the speed of light. And so for example, if the, if the density, if the earth had to be packed as densely and would, would have to have the gravity that's exerted by the gravitational field exerted by equivalently equivalent to that of a black hole, all the matter in the earth would have to be crushed to less than one centimeter. So that's how dense and that's how compacted would have to be.

Speaker 3:          00:21:47       Um, so now, um, but the real idea of black holes, um, was proposed by Einstein. And Einstein is a very interesting case and I talk about this very peculiar feature of his, which is he came up with some of the most radical ideas in physics in the last hundred years. Um, uh, without a doubt. Um, and Edo reconceptualized Newtonian gravity theory of general relativity, the photoelectric effect, you know, quantum mechanics. I mean, he's just made so many contributions, but he's notorious for one thing, which is when the implications of his own ideas get worked out by others, he often doesn't like them and he pushes back his own idea. So he did not believe in black holes for very long time, just as he did not believe in the expanding universe. There's a very famous story. So in the expanding investment, Hubble discovered that the distances between galaxies was changing, um, that galaxies were speeding away from each other.

Speaker 3:          00:22:43       And the speed with which they were moving away from each other was proportional to their distance from us. The so called hobbled law, Einstein was a holdout. He did not believe this. And it took him many years and only after a huge amount of data because he had a classical belief in a steady universe. It was too disorienting. He liked the classical notion of fixed stars and somehow the universe being static and fixed. And so, um, there's, um, there's an, um, uh, there was a seminar in 1929 when Einstein is supposed to have stood up and finally said, okay, I concede to hobble that, you know, yes, the, um, university is expanding, but then recently colleagues of mine found, uh, in the Jerusalem, um, Einstein Archives and unpublished manuscript because do is incorrect. Him Trying Einstein, trying to recover a static universe solution two years later, even after having publicly.

Speaker 3:          00:23:34       So He's notorious for not liking the implications of his own radical ideas. So it was no different with black holes. He absolutely did not like the idea of the black hole because of the fact that the black hole and cases, a singularity, it's a place where all known physical laws breakdown. And to Einstein, that was very, very uncomfortable. And he could not imagine that nature would permit such a state that you could evolve to such a state or you would have such an object. So the amazing thing about general relativity is that Einstein had this very deep insight and he kind of married physics and geometry in a way. And unlike our Newton, he actually gave an explanation for gravity and he gave an explanation where gravity is really the interaction of spacetime, this four dimensional entity with matter. And that basically matter causes potholes or divots in space time and, and these divots.

Speaker 3:          00:24:29       And therefore the curvature of space time, um, determines how objects move, how masses actually move. Right? So, um, so a simple way to think about Einstein's reconceptualization radical reconceptualization of Newton's gravity is the effect that matter has on, uh, on space time. And if you can imagine spacetime to be a sheet. So if you have, um, the sun, you can see the divert. It's a pivot. It's a pothole that, uh, is generated in spacetime and it will impact the emotions of, as we'll see later, impact the emotions of planet mercury, for example, which is lying very close to the sun and a neutron star, which is much more densely packed and more compact. Notice the port hole is deeper and the black hole is very peculiar because it's actually an infinitely deep puncture in spacetime. Okay. So, and this is why, you know, it was an uncomfortable concept.

Speaker 3:          00:25:25       And so, um, swash child found the solutions of what a SWOT child found was the geometry of space time that corresponds to the region, right around a very compact mass. And so what is very peculiar is that there is this region called the event horizon, which is the point of no return. But there are also these orbits where the inner most tables, circular orbit, where you could be sort of in Dante is limbo. If you were on that orbit, you could be there, uh, for infinity. And, and, uh, the curious thing, things about black holes, it there in their vicinity. Not only a space, the form, but the nature of time also changes. So time slows down, um, next to a black hole. So let me quickly move on to what our current challenges are in terms of understanding black holes. And uh, it really has to do with the formation, how you formed the first black holes, how do you actually grow them, how you fuel them and do the black holes actually impact their environment.

Speaker 3:          00:26:23       And so this is a very, very challenging problem. And I think many of you who work with problems on that couple of many different scales of complexity will understand this. Uh, and um, appreciate what the challenges for us. So for example, the blackboard at the center of the Milky ways a million times the mass of the sun, the Swa Schild radius or the event horizon of that is the size, you know, about 10 to the 12th I'm centimeters. And if that was a penny, then the galactic nucleus, the inner region where the blackwood exerts it's influence nowhere near our solar system, just the very inner regions of the galaxy is just about eight orders of magnitude. And then the stellar component of the galaxy spread out another eight orders of magnitude. And then the full extent of the galaxy has, we'll just know because the galaxy is going to be primarily dark matter and that extends quite far out. And then you connect onto cosmic scales and basically the stellar extent of the galaxies already the size of the earth. And it's like having a penny in the center of the earth. However, the energetics of black holes are so immense that they do actually affect, uh, the vicinity. So the question is, where do you find black holes? You'll find black old supermassive black holes, which are about a million times the mass of the sun in the centers of almost all galaxies. And so I want to show you an artist's rendition.

Speaker 3:          00:27:45       Let me see. Yup. Uh, so this is real, the Hubble space telescope data. But once you go into the black hole, we cannot map the inner most regions of the black hole. And now we are going to march over to an artist's rendition of this accretion disk, which is the feeding gas disc for black hole, which will appear now in the center of the frame. And black holes are, um, the accretion process. So as gas falls onto the black hole,

Speaker 3:          00:28:11       it gets heated and the temperature is about a million to 10 million Calvin. So you'd start radiating in the x rays and an optical. So you actually see the dying gasps of material before they make it into the black hole. And that's how black holes are revealed to us. And the supermassive black holes that are growing very actively and accreting gas or water quasars, they actually can, they're so bright that they can outshine an entire galaxy. And these are the most distant objects that we actually have access to. And so it turns out that black holes actually come into states. They're either fasting or they're feasting, they're basically Benjie objects. And so you either they're actively creating and growing with gas, and then you'll see them as quite as ours. They out trying their host galaxies or you have the guy, a black hole, like the one, the center of our galaxy, which is essentially not feeling, it's fasting.

Speaker 3:          00:28:58       There's almost no gas there is just sitting there, right? And it, it has gravity. So it does influence the motion of stars right around the black hole. And in fact this is the most incontrovertible evidence that we have for the existence of a black hole period and for existence of a black hole in the center of our galaxy. So what do you really see here are orbits of Real Stars. This is data taken at the Keck telescope and you will see that, you know, we are far enough away the gender relativities, it's beyond the regime of general relativity because we see nice classical capillary and on Orbitz here, right? So we are, you know, we just knew Tony and understanding, we can figure out the mass of the object, which is shown as a, and that's where the 4 million, 4 million times the mass of the solar masses comes from, from that measurement.

Speaker 3:          00:29:47       And so this is just to show you where we are in terms of understanding how gas actually makes it into a black hole. So one thing we still don't understand what is an unsolved problem, although we have some ideas, is how do you actually lose the angular momentum? You have to lose the Anglo momentum before you actually make it into the hole. So we have lots of ideas about structures that you could have that would enable mass to move inward and you know, went to him to move outward like some kind of viscosity and disks and so on. So our current understanding is you have some kind of feeding bisque from which mattered rains onto the black hole. So this is a, um, a simulation from a one of my former graduate students, which actually shows you, um, the, uh, what really happens, what are the feeding episodes for black holes?

Speaker 3:          00:30:32       Like, so structure in the universal assembles mostly by mergers, by mergers of galaxies. And what you see here are two spiral galaxies, gastric spiral galaxies that have accreting black holes. And the flickering tells you the accretion that the fact that the accretion is on and these black holes are actually actively growing dude, uh, during the merger process. So what's very interesting is the, um, the merger itself is quite violent. In the end, you'll have these two galaxies merge their dark matter Halos, which you don't see here a merge, the stars merge, they get spewed out and the black holes actually merge as well in the end. And this is another way to grow a black hole by actually literally tracking them and merging. And as you may all remember, we actually saw this merger happen for lower mass black hole. I am interested in the supermassive black holes, but what we saw, legos detection of gravitational waves came from the merger of two 30 solar mass black holes.

Speaker 3:          00:31:27       So, and this is um, one of my earliest simulations, which is gives you, so this is a top view of a very supermassive black hole in the center. And you have a second one that falls into the disc and how it plows and makes its way into the disc. And you'll see a, what you see is the surface, the mass distribution in that disk is the yellow curb that you see in the panel. And what you see here is the second black hole has plunked in. And one of the most interesting this is by now, this is all work, but this at the time was kind of revolutionary because we realized what the timescales for the flows are extremely long in this problem. But we noticed something very interesting happens that the inner portion of the disc gets detached from the outer and the inner portion.

Speaker 3:          00:32:13       Actually the timescales, the smaller disk, the timescales are very short. So you can actually merge two black holes very rapidly if you have a gas disc. And what you see as waves are density waves that are generated in the accretion disk, which are potentially observable because you'd get emission, you'd get shocks from them and you could probably get flares that we would see. So as you all know, the breakthrough really, uh, um, in the Lygo detection, really the behind the scene, what really happened was an amazing breakthrough in computational gr. And for 25 years, there had been no progress on how to model the merger of two black holes in the regime, not the regime where it's Kepler's laws, but in the regime by general relativity matters. And so there was a breakthrough, um, um, mostly attribute it to a Franz Pretorius who is a Princeton who came up with a new computational trick to actually model the punctures in space time and their mergers.

Speaker 3:          00:33:09       And you needed that so that you could then template what the events would look like. And without the templates, you wouldn't know how to pick out the signal. So this is a, you must have all seen, this was just incredible. I really did not imagine it what happened in my and my lifetime. But what I'm really waiting for is the merger of supermassive black holes, which is much lower frequency than the lego event. And it needs, these detectors are Lygo like arm interferometer in space and that is being planned by the Europeans and NASA is reluctantly but slowly joining in on the Gip. And so hopefully that window will be open because that is the, that's the signal you would get from the merger of the supermassive black holes. And we think that the mergers of supermassive black holes are very significant. Early on in the university, they structured the galaxy, they control the modulators, star formation in galaxies and so on.

Speaker 3:          00:33:58       So it would really be important to detect that. So let me quickly now move on to the idea of dark matter. And the way we detect dark matter is the impact, the dark matter. It's impact of dark matter on dynamics and the motions of stars in a galaxy or the motion of galaxies in a cluster. And a cluster is an agglomeration of about a thousand galaxies that are held together as we'll see by huge amounts of dark matter. They are the largest repositories of dark matter in the universe. And the other thing, so that is if you want to think classically Allah Newton, but if you want to think our Einstein, uh, and use a phenomenon that was predicted in general relativity, which is the bending of light light traversing through all those potholes generated by all the matter in the universe, then that data, gravitational lensing also points to the existence of a huge amount of dark matter.

Speaker 3:          00:34:50       And in fact, I'm going to, um, um, clarify to you that one of the reasons, you know, I often get asked, I mean, it's dark matter also, one of these is a place holder. You don't know what's going on. Is it going to go away like ether? I think there's a reason it's not actually going to go away. It is embarrassing that we are yet to find the dark matter particle, but that's because I think we're not quite looking comprehensively like we should, we kind of locked into certain bits of parameter space where we've been searching and we've been unsuccessful so far. But the history of the idea of dark matter is attributed to this cantankerous astronomer, Fritz Zwicky, who was at Caltech. Um, and so what he did was he looked at the speeds of galaxies in this cluster called coma, which is a nearby cluster.

Speaker 3:          00:35:30       And that's an image on old image of the coma cluster. And he looked and he founded the velocities of the galaxies that were going around. They were held together by the gravity of something. And he realized that there had to be some kind of Dunkel material, dark matter, that contributed to the gravitational force that these test protocols we're feeling. And then he, in 1937, Einstein already had predicted gravitational lensing, which is the idea of the bending of light because of the distortions in spacetime light from distant sources on route to us. We'll sample every pothole. I mean, and I like to remind, um, I'm thinking about this all the time because, you know, my local highway near new haven is [inaudible] 95. It has the best portholes believe me. Um, and, uh, you know, I, you know, I came up with this analogy because I'm driving there and you know, I was like, oh, okay, this is it.

Speaker 3:          00:36:18       Um, so, you know, if you look at gravitational lensing, there's also incontrovertible evidence. So let's look at, um, how this idea was, how it was discovered. This concept of dark matter, and I said dark matter was empirical, right? So who, who you see here are, um, uh, photographs are very Reuben can't Ford and 300, um, these are the people who measured in the 1970s the speeds of stars in a spiral galaxy from the center outward. And they found something kind of peculiar. So what you'll see in the white curve is the measured value. Why is that peculiar? So let's just come closer to home and look at gravity in the solar system. If you look at the sun, which is a major gravitating body in the solar system, and you look at the speeds of planets from the sun outward, and you know, I have a bit of a blind spot.

Speaker 3:          00:37:01       Pluto still appears is a planet. I'm refusing to let that go. Um, and so you'll see the velocity of planets is actually falls off as you go further out. And that tells you that gravitationally dominant body in the solar system is the sun and it's in the center and things fall off as expected. So contrast that with what you're finding in galaxies completely the opposite. You see that the speeds are starting to pick up in the inner regions, they actually stayed flat and that tells you that there is some matter distribution, some source of gravity, there's kind of holding up the galaxy if you will, are pretty large radio. I in fact they continue as a flat. These are core rotation curves and they're pretty flat out to quite large distances and and so, and this is not just one galaxy. This is typical of pretty much every galaxy.

Speaker 3:          00:37:44       So this is just the data and just to drive home the contrast and it tells you that gravitationally you were completely different situation in these two cases. So this is our current conception of a galaxy, that the stellar component is just the tip of the iceberg. It's a five to 10% of the total mass of the galaxy. Most of it is unseen and it's dark matter that is heaped in the center but extends out to very large radius, almost 10 times further out. Then you see the light in a galaxy which is already pretty concentrated. And um, and this dark matter we think is made of cold collision, less particles. These particles that are very peculiar that actually do not have pressure, they don't collide so they don't have pressure. So when they interact they just interact gravitational, this go past each other. Okay. And we are yet to find the particle.

Speaker 3:          00:38:32       Um, and there, there are many, many attempts to look for it. So let me know. The, the discovery of light deflection is kind of very, very interesting because, you know, even, uh, just Newton's ideas, if you thought of lightest corpuscles and not as waves, you could, you would have predicted deflection of these particles by gravitational focusing when you go past something that's really massive. And in fact, Soldner did just that in 1804. He actually calculated that. And, um, and oddly that value that's in the Newtonian context. Whereas if your content, if you computed in the framework of general rights or do you actually calculate the geodesics of life and then all your desks of light as from distant sources coming to us, you actually find that value is just a factor of two off classical value. And in fact, when I'm in Nazi Germany, when there was pushback back against Einstein, one of the things that, um, the Nazis brought up was that, you know, his new final ideas, we're not really needed.

Speaker 3:          00:39:30       General relativity was not needed. They actually re had sold newspaper republished because they said, well, you know, a great science has already been done by Aryans and you know, this number was already calculated. So, you know, so that there's some very, very interesting stories, backstories for all these radical ideas and the push backs at various times, not just from within science, which is what I focused on, but in the larger culture right there. It's a rich form of stories there. So, but the verification of general relativity actually came from the confirmation of this prediction of light bending. And it's a famous experiment, eclipse experiment in 1917 and 1919 by author Reddington. And so just to remind you what that experiment was, um, it was a very cool experiment. Basically during a solar eclipse you have the earth moon and the sun line up. So you can see all the divots kind of line up and you have light from distant stars would get deflected maximally because there are all these three pot holes that line up and what you end up seeing.

Speaker 3:          00:40:29       And then once you're done with the eclipse, you can go back to the same part of the sky and look at the positions of stars. And you find that the actual positions are different from the apparent positions during an eclipse. And you can measure the deflection. And it was right on where Einstein had predicted. And today this is a very, very powerful tool. And a lot of my work, uh, on mapping dark matter relies on using gravitational lensing. So the idea is very similar. You have distant galaxies in the universe and you have a very massive cluster of galaxies, and there's an artist's impression of the pothole that's generated by the dark matter that is unseen. And so the light from this galaxy gets deflected and what you end up, what the effect of that is that you end up seeing the distorted shape of that galaxy.

Speaker 3:          00:41:18       You no longer see the real trip. Luckily, dark matter is smeared lightly everywhere in the universe, but it's lumped only in very few locations, locations where galaxies form and locations where clusters form or where you have a huge amount of dark matter. And therefore we know the distribution of undistorted shapes of galaxies statistically. So when we look at a place where they're distorted shapes, we can back out the entire distribution of matter along a cylinder from us to the background sources. So for example, this is a beautiful gravitational lens discovered by the Hubble Space Telescope. Here the lens is an individual galaxy, not a cluster. And you see the decomposition. What you see actually projected on the sky is this arc and the galaxy in the center of the Lens. In Galaxy in the center. And when you work it out, that is the original shape of the source of the galaxy.

Speaker 3:          00:42:12       It's a little wispy blue thing that's a distant galaxy that star forming and it gets because of how it lines up with the spot or it gets totally deflected and you see this deflected shape. This is just another schematic to show you that. Uh, so to give you a sense, so this is actually a mapping. So gravitational lensing is a mapping if you will, from an a source plane to an image plan and the source plane shapes to image plane shapes. And it turns out that there are regimes where this mapping is not linear, it's not linear, it's not one to one. And then there's a redeem where this mapping is one to one. So the regime where the mapping is one to one is called weak lensing. Um, and the regime where you have um, gone linearities and the, it's a multi valued mapping, it's called strong lensing.

Speaker 3:          00:42:56       And the reason it's called strong lensing is sometimes the divert is so deep. The pothole is so dramatic that if you can think of light rays as tubes, you actually split the tube, you end up seeing multiple copies of what is actually just one object. Okay? So in this animation you see a range. So what you see in red is the surface mass density of a cluster of galaxies, which gives you a sense of how deep that pothole is going to be. And you had a background screen with galaxies that were basically circular in shape just for illustration. And you can see the range of shapes that you could get. Nothing is moving in the university, just Fannie Mae Nation, to show your range of shapes, right? That you could get. And the point is we do, we see all of those shapes and it says Hubble Space Telescope data.

Speaker 3:          00:43:43       And here you see five copies of a galaxy. And we know it's the same galaxy because we have the spectrum, we go out and take the spectrum. And another thing that, uh, gravitational lensing does is because it's preserved surface brightness, um, you, it magnifies these faint sources and brings galaxies interview that you would otherwise not see. So clusters of galaxies and dark matter act as very convenient in a sort of natural telescopes for us, except we can't control them. They happened to be where they are, right? And that's the bane of cosmology, right? That it's a no controlled experiments. Right? Um, um, and so you see sort of five and you can back out the dark matter distribution. So this is one of my favorite, uh, clusters of galaxies and other, you know, Hubble, so Hubble Space Telescope transformed this field. This field could not have really moved to the waste that he did without the Hubble space, whether corrected optics of course, for those of you who might remember.

Speaker 3:          00:44:35       Um, so you have these, you can see by eye these highly distorted sources. The fuzzy yellow things that you see are galaxies that are in the cluster. So they are in the foreground and the wispy things that are stretched out are the guys in the background. So their, their shapes are deformed. I said, why is this important? And you may say, well why is she going on and on? So this is a simulation, a slice of a simulation of a patch of the universe where a cluster forms a cluster like the one that causes these deviations in the light rail paths forms. And this is not light, this is just mock it up to look like light. These are all dark matter particles and the only interaction you have here is gravity. And this is just aggregating due to gravity. These are collision less dark matter particles.

Speaker 3:          00:45:16       And this simulation we'll show you that the dark matter distribution in. So that pink region is roughly the cluster that you saw in sort of one of the Hubble space telescope images. And notice the dark matter is very, very clumpy, right? It's a lot of small scale structure. And the reason we are very interested in mapping dark matter and you know mapping it as explicitly as possible catch capturing all the granularity of it is because there are fundamental clue to the nature of dark matter in, in the distribution. So, if the dark matter is this cold, dark matter that had been telling you about pressure, less collision less, it will be extremely clumpy. And if it was a different kind of particle, a warm dark matter particle, it would be a lot smoother. So the game now is to sales particle physics has not made progress in finding us.

Speaker 3:          00:46:02       This particle is for astrophysics to go and try to find clues. And a question is, you know that if we use gravitational lensing, for example, that scene here, um, what's the verdict? What does it look like? So this is to give you a sense of the kind of work that I do. And one of the reasons I wanted to show this, uh, these give you a feel for this is that we are happy to recruit any of you who wants to volunteer to, um, uh, to participate in, um, in research, in any research projects. So what you see here in the yellow bunny rabbit is the region, uh, behind which any source would get multiple imaged. Okay. And everything outside is basically the week lends in region. That's a nonlinear regime. And so what you see here are the potential. So if you look, you're looking at the, at the potential well of dark matter and the equal potentials or those elongated.

Speaker 3:          00:46:51       And what you see are those galaxies with the red, um, ellipsis. Those are the putative dark matter Halos, the dark matter associated with individual Alice of galaxies. And that's the granularity. And this is what a three dimensional rendering of that looks like. So dark matter in clusters is heaped in a smooth distribution. And then there are lots of lumps, so it's extremely clumpy. And so, um, it turns out, uh, so this is the latest and the greatest. This is a paper that just came out. Uh, so this is from a recent data from the Hubble Space Telescope. What you see on the right hand side is a reconstructed dark matter distribution in the blue haze. This, the stuff that you don't actually see that is, they're gravitationally. So where are we? Uh, we've not detected dark matter. Okay. And, uh, you know, there've been particle detection experiments where basically it's a sodium iodide crystal, you're looking for juggling in the crystal.

Speaker 3:          00:47:44       No, no luck. You're looking for inert gases. We looking for motion of dark matter particles through that. No, no success yet. But there was one controversial claim for the detection of having detected dark matter. So if dark matter, you know, if we have these sort of, if we are enveloped in dark matter, um, the solar system, then as the seasons change and our relative motion changes, they should be a dark matter wind and we should see a correlation. We should see a modulation in the a dark matter. So there's a, there's a collaboration Italian collaboration that claimed to have found it about 15 years ago. Uh, and they did not manage to persuade the community. So the thing that's finally happening, which we would all been clamoring for for while is a replication of that experiment. So the same company that made the same sodium iodide crystal, it has made five replications and the experiment is being repeated in Antartica, Spain, South Korea, Germany.

Speaker 3:          00:48:34       And so we'll have to see in three years we'll know if this experiment is results are going to hold up. I'm not very optimistic about that, but I just want to conclude by showing you what are we actually. So what is the goal? And you know, and in a way, this is also personally what the goal is, right? What, what are we really after and what are people like me after? So I think that we are testing gravity. We know that the Einstein's theory of general relativity is incomplete. And there it is not yet married to. We don't have a quantum theory of gravity. And string theorists have been working and successfully, they've made some progress, but still we don't quite have a theory. And so what does the lesson, so, you know, history teaches us something quite interesting. So in the 1,718 hundreds there was a deviation scene in the orbit of Uranus from Newton's predictions.

Speaker 3:          00:49:24       And I'll be in la, very, a French mathematician, astronomer predicted the presence of another perturbing planet that needed to be taken into account. And that was Neptune. And it was found, and it was, you know, as he predicted it similarly, there was a deviation in the orbit of mercury that was found. And Oban livery. I said, you know, use the same explanation. He said, hey, there has to be a planet between Mercury and son. He called it welcome. They were supposed sightings are welcome, one can is not there. So you know, if you had to wait for another 74 years for Einstein's theory of general relativity to actually append the Newton completely right. So in one case you just needed a refinement of an existing theory in another case. And a normally actually pointed the way forward to a brand new theory. Although it was not, it was not quite that this observation did not inspire Einstein.

Speaker 3:          00:50:11       Right. For Einstein is famous for having come up with a theory of general relativity, sort of Eczema Hylo, right. He did part experiments. He did get Duncan experiments. He didn't actually, you know, do, he was aware of the data, but uh, and one of the triumphs was this explanation of the anomalies in the anomalous precession of the orbit of mercury. So, um, I just stop here. Thank you so much for your attention. And I just want to conclude, wait, I'll just show this in the background because it's a superb, a movie that massive made on. I've got an understanding of black holes and a lot of the work that I've been doing over the years has contributed to this movie. So I'm very pleased with how it looks. So, um, what does actually shows you is our observational access to black holes. So the x ray emission on exactly where the ambition comes from.

Speaker 3:          00:51:03       And for those of you will probably saw interstellar and hopefully loved it like I did. They did. They actually solve the real equations of general relativity for the, for the light shadows around Gargantua. And so this is the real McCoy. So this is actually the gas and you'll see the photon rings as well as show you the angle. So this is what you see in the soft x rays. So the low energy x-rays, that's the, to give you a perspective, that's the event horizon size of the event horizon. And this is sort of the angle from which we are viewing. So you have a central black hole and this structure is the feeding accretion this, but these are sort of the paths of life around the black hole and you have this like inner a photon ring, this sort of limbo where you would be in limbo. And the motto that's calling in the gas that's falling in his bed up to about half seat in the inner regions and this coloring of blue and red, which you seem sort of publish mixing is sort of the red shifting and Lou shifting of gas that is moving towards awesome. The way from us on you also see heart emission, hot x ray emission, very, very energetic photons coming from the accretion disk. And that actually comes from the random scattering of gas and electronics.

Speaker 3:          00:52:43       So this is the sort of kind of data that we're actually getting now. So you get the extra spectra and we can actually map it to spatially where in the context of this accretion disk model, the radiation originates from. And actually there's a very exciting new project called the event Horizon Telescope in which doesn't attempt to measure that in a photon ring for the black hole in the center galaxy using the entire earth as a radio telescope dish. Anyway, I will stop here finally. Thank you so much for your patients.

Speaker 4:          00:53:20       Yes.

Speaker 3:          00:53:21       So where are we ready with the first question? Yeah, go ahead. So there's a question

Speaker 5:          00:53:26       on the simulation of galaxies colliding. It's an understanding gags that are mostly empty space. And I was wondering what, uh, what we know about what would happen to the contents of these galaxies. Like we just started start murmuring to each other or just passing the night or become binary.

Speaker 3:          00:53:39       Yeah, they buy, they would, as you saw, what you saw was the stories and the gas that was shown in that rendition, both stars and gas. So you would have some fraction of the stars would actually get splattered out and there would be a portion of it would fall back, would be on elongated orbits, but they would come back and splash back and fall back. But they would actually mix the Stella components of the two galaxies would actually mix up and, uh, you would form a much more concentrated distribution of stars depending on the angle and the dynamics of the merger. And we actually believe that a structure built up hierarchy hierarchical in the universe through the merger of small galaxies over cosmic time. So a, at early times you had an abundance of small galaxies, small galaxies were formed first they collide and you assembled more massive galaxies as time goes on. But yes, they're very violent events. The energetics are pretty staggering.

Speaker 6:          00:54:34       Uh, my first question for you is, um, you didn't mention a gravity at all. Yup. You start getting the reason for that.

Speaker 3:          00:54:42       Yeah. Because I mean, a lot of the work that I've been talking about is very much in the classical regime and the current observational data is really restricted, you know, is, um, we don't need quantum physics to interpret the data, maybe in a quantum gravity to actually interpret the data. We need quantum physics to understand how radiation, but, um, yeah, this is very much still in, in the classical classical rigid.

Speaker 6:          00:55:07       All right. So second question is in that classical regime, uh, and a black hole, a coe. What can you tell us about the, um, Eric goes for your frame dragging and time travel? No.

Speaker 3:          00:55:21       Okay. All, all, all of the questions in one. Yeah. So, um, the you do expect, as I said, the nature of time also changes. So you expect this, a frame dragging this effect is called the Bardi in Patterson effect in the inner regions of black holes. And we actually have evidence for that. Uh, uh, especially when you see two black holes merging and you'll see the, the frames that are being dragged spacetime that's been dragged as the margin. And the way that manifests is you'll see some jitter in the jets that are produced by. So we think now that we have a measurement of frame dragging, we can actually explain it in the context of the models that we currently have of accretion disk around black holes and jets. As for time travel, um, it's mathematically permitted, but that doesn't mean that a, it's possible.

Speaker 4:          00:56:14       Thank you.

Speaker 5:          00:56:18       Um, so you were talking about a dark meadow, dark matter halos around, um, you know, galaxies and so forth. Have we actually observed like clumps of dark matter, independent of visible matter of galaxies or things like that?

Speaker 3:          00:56:30       That's a great question. So that is a bill that's been the sort of perennial quest. So at the moment, uh, we find that light and mass trace each other quite well in the universe. It's not linear, it's not a one to one, but, uh, typically, uh, we have not, we are yet to find clumps of dark matter that do not have any stars or gas that's associated with them. The closest thing that we have are these dwarf galaxies, which are these very piddly low mass galaxies, about a billion times the mass of the sun, the mass of the entire galaxy, right? It's about a thousand. The mass of the, uh, our galaxy. And these galaxies, some of them are so tiny that you have, are either not formed very many stars. And so you see just hot gas and a few stores that extremely dark matter dominated.

Speaker 3:          00:57:19       And, and if you did have stories earlier on, they will probably rejected. They're such wimpy potential wells. The gravity, um, at early times when it was assembling was such that you had one supernova explosion and you kind of splattered out all the stars. And maybe that's why you've ended up, but those are the kind of the objects that you get closest to which are nearly dark, but even they are not completely dark. But, you know, we've been looking always in the mapping work that I do in gravitational lensing. Uh, there have been claims at some point saying, oh, we found a dark cluster. But then you look deeper. There's just, they're faint. Galaxies are just munched and it's just that, you know, we've missed them. But that would be cool if we did find them.

Speaker 5:          00:57:59       So, so does that, does that imply like, come on, can we draw conclusions that, like, if, if we think that dark mattered, never clumps independently of physical matter, is there, is there a theory or an explanation for that behavior?

Speaker 3:          00:58:14       I know, I mean, I think it's not the dark matter. It doesn't clump independent of, uh, of Baryons, but that baryons always find their way to gravitational potential wells that are generated by the dark matter because dark matter really structures the universe.

Speaker 7:          00:58:31       So way back when, there was a discussion as to whether or not there was enough matter in the universe to change Friedman's equations to being closed versus forever expanding. Yup. Where does that discussion stands now with what we know about dark matter? Yes.

Speaker 3:          00:58:47       Well, so what we know in 1998, uh, we discovered that the expansion of the universe is actually accelerating. And so it's driven by, um, by a force that countervails the attraction of gravity's a repulsive force and um, that appears to be driving this. And the contribution of that repulsive force to the, the energy density budget of the universe was 70%. So it was sort of the dominant component today. And so what it showed us was that the inventory, the pie chart that I showed you, he said the dark matter is the dominant matter component. But in terms of the total energy density, the mass energy density of the universe, uh, the dominant piece is still dark energy. We don't quite know what dark energy is right yet, except we know what it does. And as you can see with a lot of these entities, we actually know what, how they effect motions. I know measurable quantities, although we don't know what they are and how they are actually in the case of dark matter, we know how it's distributed. In the case of dark energy, we really don't know yet whether it's a field. It could have been a scalar field in the very early universe. Um, um, but there is no plausible theory quite yet.

Speaker 7:          01:00:06       We're meant to act as you presume the dark end Jack Energy is effectively uniform because otherwise it was a clumping of dark energy. It's gravitation uniforms

Speaker 3:          01:00:17       spatially as an, it is accelerate space time in a uniform way, but it has come to dominate at later times. Temporarily. It has come to dominate at later times. So there was an epoch in the universe when, uh, the energy density was dominated by radiation in the early stages, then matter took over and mattered, dominated mostly dark matter. And then at late times now dark energy has taken over temporarily.

Speaker 7:          01:00:43       Oh, I have to choose, dammit. So they'll go for it. Okay. You had mentioned earlier that, um, what different theories, different ideas about what dark matter could d could be, have different implications for his distribution, like you had said, clumpy or versus more smoothly distributed. If you can describe to lay people at all in the time we have remaining, what sort of parameters are varying there that might, yeah,

Speaker 3:          01:01:06       so, um, so what it is so clumping, right? It's um, um, it's a substructure. It is the structure of, um, the detailed distribution, the granularity of dark matter. So you can define this quantity called us sub halo, the substructure mass function, how much mass you have in every, um, uh, how, how many sub structures you have in any mass, Ben. And that can be characterized. So within, so within our galaxy, for example, which is about 10 to the 12 times the mass of the sun, the question is how many clubs there are that are 10 to the 10 solar masses tend to the nine solar masses. That spectrum. It's a power law and we think it has a slope of minus 1.8399999999999999 cold, dark matter for other kinds of dark matter. It is not as seamless power law. There's a cutoff. And so we're kind of looking for a cutoff in that power spectrum, if you will. You know, these, these fluctuations, right? They're basically these dark matter clumps arise from fluctuations in a mean field very early on in the universe that get amplified over time.

Speaker 7:          01:02:11       Okay, so this isn't necessarily about like different ways dark matter might behave now about more like an actual condition.

Speaker 3:          01:02:18       No, no, it's, it's to the initial conditions,

Speaker 2:          01:02:20       but you see the manifestation now of how it's actually spatially distributed and what the mass function of those clumps is.

Speaker 3:          01:02:30       All right, thanks everybody. And let's please give one last round of applause.

Speaker 2:          01:02:33       [inaudible].
