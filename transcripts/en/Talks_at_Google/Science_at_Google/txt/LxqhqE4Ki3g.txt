Speaker 1:          00:06          We have Olivia and Judah here. Um, Olivia wrote The New York Times bestselling book called Charisma Myth. If you haven't read it, it's amazing. Um, and Judah works for Berkeley's Haas business school and also worked at Starbucks and they recently wrote a book called the Net and the butterfly, um, to, to help you work on your creative process. So without any further ado, let's welcome them to Google

Speaker 2:          00:34          you.

Speaker 3:          00:36          So when we started doing research for this book, we came upon this really wild pattern. And so this is Leo's Dillard. He went to a lecture in the late thirties about nuclear physics. And as he was walking across the street, literally in mid stride, he had this realization about how he could start a nuclear chain reaction using vision. Then we get Henri palm cafe. How'd I do? How'd I do, oh, he Pornchai Olivia's native French speakers. Every time I come up a French word, it's a nightmare. Kills me. So he was working on an incredibly difficult series of math functions. And one morning as he was getting on a bus to go to a conference, he remembers this very distinctly. He put his foot on the step, the first step of the bus, and suddenly it came to him. He knew what his answer was, so then we come to Nicola Tesla who is trying to work on a functioning, alternating current generator.

Speaker 3:          01:29          He's walking through a park with his friends. When suddenly he realizes exactly how he's going to do it. He needs one of the engines to rotate in the opposite direction from the other two that had gone to be part of the generator. This also brings us to Heisenberg Heisenberg, sorry. For those of you who are fans, if you type hot, if you now type Heisenberg into the Google search engine, that's what you get. He has now eclipsed Verner. Walter has a coat's Verner Verner. Heisenberg has a conversation with Niels Bohr and Copenhagen late night walking home through a park. What happens? He's like, can the universe really be a strange as I think it is? He comes up with the uncertainty principle. This just keeps happening. Girdle and Einstein famous for taking walks together in Princeton at the Institute for Advanced Study, Darwin had something called the sand walk. What he would do is he would start at the corner there and he put a couple of stones, he'd stack them and he'd walk the sand walk while he thought about the problem and he'd knock a stone off every lap.

Speaker 3:          02:24          And he knew, he's like, this is a three stone problem. There's a six stone problem. But he would walk his way to the answer. Same thing with Tchaikovsky, three hour walks every afternoon and then we get Emmanuel con to it. It said you could set your watch by his walks cause he'd walk around the town square the same time every day. You keep going back in history. It keeps showing up. Aristotle who founded a school and they were known as the peripatetics. Why? Cause they walked around as they philosophized and then of course we had the famous story of Archimedes who's stepping into the tub, watches the water displacement and suddenly realizes, this is how I'm going to figure out if the crown is solid gold or not by checking its density. Something very strange is going on, but the story keeps happening over and over and it's not just walking. It happens with sleep. So this is Dimitri men delay. If you spent three years working on a chemistry textbook driven crazy that he couldn't put it into more order and during a feverish nap, woke up with a picture of this in his head, wrote it down as fast as he could.

Speaker 2:          03:22          Okay,

Speaker 3:          03:23          who's our neck? Oh, you're going to hate me again. August.

Speaker 2:          03:27          Yeah.

Speaker 3:          03:28          Are you going to make me do it? You Go. Kukula had I do know nightmare. We're moving on. So chemist and chemists, 18 hundreds everybody's trying to figure out the shape of benzene at the time. Nobody can do it. He has a dream of a snake eating its own tail and suddenly realizes that benzine is a rang. This literally creates structural organic chemistry, which creates the tar and die or industries. It creates the pharmaceutical industries. If you ever wondered why so many pharmaceutical companies are German, because he was German. It started as first lab in Bond Ramanujan. Famous numbers theorists from India used to say that the goddess would write the equations on his tongue and his dreams, and so he'd wake up with stuff like this.

Speaker 3:          04:15          Finally Salvador Dali. Now he knew exactly what he was doing was sleep. He would sit down in a straight back chair and he would hang his arm over the side holding a metal key with a metal plate underneath and as he dozed off, he would drop the key and the key would hit the plate, make a rattle, wake him up. And as soon as he woke up, he just start drawing and we all know what those drawings ended up looking like. So here we have all of these geniuses who are accessing, walking and sleeping in different ways to come up with these amazing breakthroughs. What is it that they figured out? What did they know? And as another example, I want to tell you that when I was showering this morning thinking about this talk coming here, I suddenly realized I wanted to show you all this.

Speaker 2:          04:54          Okay? [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          05:09          I'm going to come back to that. I'm going to tell you why I wanted to show you that in a minute. It's not just cause it's really funny with which it is. We have the capacity to know so much. When we look up at the stars were amazed at how many stars are, I were amazed at the sheer immensity of the universe and our place in it. But the reality is that when we look up at the sky, that's how much we're actually seeing.

Speaker 2:          05:32          Okay?

Speaker 3:          05:33          We are not truly aware of how much is out there. We're not truly aware of how much more we could see. And the same is true of how we access our own brains. We are not aware of just how much we have the capacity to do. And what we wrote about in this book is not only what is this physical mechanism inside everyone's brains, and I want to be clear, it's, it's not just geniuses. The geniuses have the same exact physical structures in their brain that every one of you has. But it's a question of accessing it. It's a question of trusting it. And so what we're gonna do is we're going to talk a lot about tools because the thing about breakthroughs, creativity, innovation is there a lot of theories and people lay out theories all the time. But this is, this is a craft. This is like an artisan's craft and just like artisans, there are tools and you have to practice with those tools in order to gain mastery. And that's really what we were interested in in this book. So to explain what the process is in your brain, we made a short animation that we want to show you and the story we're going to tell you is true and everything going on inside the brain is also true.

Speaker 3:          06:46          Florida 1965 the rolling stones are on their first US tour, but they're not the rolling stones yet. They're about as popular as Herman's hermits. What they're in need of is a breakthrough. Hit a number one song and no one knows it more than Keith Richards. One night in his motel room, Richards was trying to write that song. So what's going on inside his brain? He's attempting to have this breakthrough. This is the executive of Keith Richards, his brain, it's focused on task and has a goal. Write a hit song. There's just one problem. It's not very good at breaking news by itself. See the executive network is great when you need to make a list or complete a project, but when it comes to having a breakthrough, it needs some help. That night Richard's fell asleep and no longer on task is executive went to talk to another network that lies deeper in the brain.

Speaker 3:          07:43          Now what we're about to show you is not unique to Keith Richards. You have the same exact room in your brain. We all do. We just don't access it enough. This is your genius lounge, about 10 different brain regions in here all hanging out talking. There's Mozart, Leonardo Davinci, Mary Curie, Einstein, welcome to the part of your brain that's working on stuff. When you don't think you're working on stuff that night, Richard's is executive walked in and said, quiet. All right everyone. We need a breakthrough. Hit. Now go. The executive went in busy itself, but something mindless in this case sleep, but it can be doing the dishes or the laundry or taking a shower. Meanwhile, the geniuses started sharing all kinds of information from art to music to childhood memories. This was the sum total of Keith Richards. His experience and knowledge and the combining created his intuition. It created a breakthrough. Richard's woke up in the middle of the night and began to play. That was how the rolling stones got their breakthrough hit satisfaction, but it is not just Keith Richards. We all have an executive and a genius loungey and our brains. The key to having more breakthroughs is learning how to switch between the two modes.

Speaker 2:          09:12          All right?

Speaker 3:          09:14          That was me doing the voice work and I'm going to pick that up as a second job if I can. Um, that literally is what happens in your brain when you have a breakthrough that is literally where you go when you're more creative. I'm sure all of you have had moments when you were on a run, when you were just spacing out during a walk, when you were in the shower and send them that. You just realized something. And the reason it works is because you're executive mode. The part in the front of your brain that takes care of everything that gets you places on time. That finishes projects. It has to go quiet, but it can't just, it doesn't just go quiet. If you tell it to you, it gets annoyed if you do that. So you have to fake it out. You have to give it a goal.

Speaker 3:          09:53          We're going to walk to the store now, the executives happy. We're going to finish the dishes, we're going to take a shower. The executives like, great, I have something I'm going to finish. Thank goodness I'm so happy. This is the case and it sorted, but it's kind of mindless, but you don't have to concentrate hard on it. Judah. Yes. If you're wondering what we mean by if you tell the executive to go quiet, it gets annoyed. How many of you have tried meditation, right? How many of you have experienced the monkey mind? Exactly. So you know what we're talking about. That's what happens when you try to have the consecutive to go quiet. You're welcome. And so, but if you give it this kind of mindless task, what happens is power. Literally power reroutes from the executive and goes to this genius lounge, this default mode network and it's like the espresso machine gets fired up and all the different parts of the network started drinking coffee and they start getting jazz and the different parts of this network, they encompass so many various parts.

Speaker 3:          10:48          You have your own personal memories, you have your every prediction and your future prediction. You have your sense of empathy trying to figure out how somebody else's feeling. You have your own sense of self, your met a narrative that's moving through this. You have your inferior pride or Lowe's, which is all the physical sensation coming into you. It goes on and on. The sheer number of things that this network is engaged in and what it does when you're on some sort of random little task is it starts mixing and matching information. It starts playing around is if you had a pile of Lego's and it's just making all these legos together and then holding them up and saying, is this a brilliant idea? Is that this is a brilliant idea. Now, one of the keys to this is that it's not that the executive plays no role.

Speaker 3:          11:28          As you saw on the video, the geniuses keep looking to the executive. They're like, hey, we came up with this. What do you think the executive is actually saying yes or no? And so at some point you're geniuses come up with something really good, your executive says yes and that's when it enters your level of awareness that your Aha moment. Now the science kind of stops at the moment at how does your brain determine what's a good idea and what's not a good idea? How does it know to wake you up? We don't know yet, but we do know that this is what's happening and there are certain things that we all can do to capitalize on this natural ability. And the first one is plasticity. So the reason I showed you this video was for a very specific reason. I'll show it to you again. Watch the defense.

Speaker 2:          12:17          [inaudible] stands there. They just look at the quarterback.

Speaker 3:          12:32          And the reason it works is because what's happening is not within their realm of what's possible. They don't notice it, they don't expect it, and so they can't think of what to do. He literally has the ball and is walking by seven people who could tackle him at any moment and nobody moves because they can't put it together. That is what plasticity allows us to do. Brain plasticity is our ability to build new neural connections, to understand new thoughts. To give you an idea of what plasticity is, I want to show you this, so this is a video by drew Barry who does amazing biological animations. Highly recommend you go check out his stuff, it's brilliant, and here he's got a single neuron and what you're watching happen is the Axon or the, I mean that the Soma or the body, the big bulb there is what's sort of giving out pulses of electricity.

Speaker 3:          13:29          There's new research out actually that it's not just the body that does that, but we don't need to get into that right now and we're moving along to the dendrites. These are the parts of the brain that just branch out like a river and the parts of the neurons and just go out. Now, now and along them you have these little heads, these little buds and on the top of these buds, that's where you have neurotransmitter receptors. The places that accepted things like Serotonin, dopamine, neuro epinephrin. The thing you need to realize is this is not a static situation. What you're seeing right here is you're watching a new neurotransmitter receptor be born for the first time and now all of a sudden there is a new way for the neurons to connect to one another and because there's a new way for them to connect to one another, there's a new thought that can happen because that's one of the most important things for you to understand. Your thoughts are not chemical, your thoughts are not electrical, your thoughts or structural. Your brain is literally building new neurotransmitter receptors every millisecond and in doing that you have the ability to build new connections and having the ability to build new connections gives you the ability to have a new thought.

Speaker 3:          14:44          Basically Messenger RNA sends a message to transfer RNA. This is transfer RNA. Look at the very top, you see the ACC, those are amino acids, this little factory stacks, amino acids, one on top of the other. And then when it's done it cuts them off. And then this amazing magical thing happens. The protein folds show. You've heard of this in this case and what we're talking about, these proteins fold and form new neurotransmitter receptors. So it's our ability to do that. That makes us plastic.

Speaker 3:          15:19          Your brain is structural. You're building the actual infrastructure to have a new thought. And so one of the first things that you all have to get better at that everyone has to get better at is getting more practiced at doing this. So people who tell themselves, I'm not creative, I don't think of these things, I'm not that sort of person that is equivalent to sitting on the couch for two years. And then somebody tells you to do 10 pushups and you can't. And you say, I guess I'm just weak now. I'm just forever out of shape. It's hopeless now, you know, that's not the case. You know, you just need to work out and get fit. The same is true about your own ability to have a breakthrough about your own ability to be creative. We have become neuro couch potatoes. We do the same things over and over.

Speaker 3:          16:04          And when we do the same things over and over, we don't challenge our brains to build new neurotransmitter receptors, which means we can't build a new thought. And that's why we get stuck. That's why many of us end up like the defense on that team. Something new has happened and we can't process it. We don't know what it is and it walks by us. This is what it's like when you lack neuroplasticity, but you're trying to come up with a new thought and there are tools that can help you actually get to something that's more like this. And so that's what this is really about is the tools. It's about changing your neurons from this to this. You want all those branches, you want all that connectivity. That's what you're looking for. What do you think this is?

Speaker 2:          16:49          Okay.

Speaker 3:          16:50          Don't be shy. You have no way of knowing. So there's shout stuff out. Paint fabric.

Speaker 2:          17:02          Okay.

Speaker 3:          17:04          See that, feel that push, feel that push. That's like trying to do a pushup when you're out of shape, smoke colored liquid turbulence. What was it? Mold. So this is ink drops in water and you were getting there. You are all in and around it, but now that I've told you it's inked drops in water, you're looking at it again and your brain is actually forming a new set of neural connections to make that into a memory, to understand that that's what that is. You've broken open into a new space, exposing ourselves to things we don't know to things we don't understand the things we don't see a lot. That is literally one of the greatest ways to create neuroplasticity. This is one of our favorites. Eric wine and Meyer, eh? Okay, you let it go. He has climbed the seven tiles mountains on all seven continents. There's just one funny thing is if that weren't enough, he's blind. So how does he do this? How does he possibly climb this mountain? Something called the brain port. See this little thing. He puts that on his tongue.

Speaker 3:          18:28          It is connected to these glasses where you see a camera on the front. The camera takes in the light signals and it becomes electrical impulses that are signaled to his tongue. The tongue signals those into his brain because the person who invented this Paul backer, Eda said, we don't see with our eyes. We see with our brains are, I just happened to take in the light, but if we can figure out another way to take in the light signals, our brains will figure out a way to see because our brains are so plastic because we can create so many new connections and little by little he learned to read the signals from his tongue and he could actually start to see even though there was nothing coming through his eyes. Another story we love as a young woman in China, 24 years old, walks into the hospital kind of dizzy.

Speaker 3:          19:12          They do a, they do a cat scan. She has no cerebellum. She was born without one. It was full of liquid in her head. She shouldn't have been able to ever walk much less hold down a job function, but the other parts of her brain started to take on these other abilities are our ability to be plastic is almost never ending. It's astounding. We just need to actually work the muscle and it's incredibly important that we work the muscle number of things that we like to suggest, uh, come to work one day dressed completely differently than you ever do. If your address down sort of person like I am where a suit and a tie fancy shoes, first of all, the fabric will move against you differently and it will give different physical impulses to your brain, which goes right into your default network. The other thing that will happen is people will respond to you differently.

Speaker 3:          19:59          You're going to get a whole different set of information from people as they react in these different ways and you're going to, you're just going to take this all in. If you're, if you're a woman and you tend to wear heels and dresses, wear pants and a pair of sneakers or vice versa on both the men and the women. Just change it up. Another one that I like to do is borrow somebody else's playlist that you don't know what it is and just listened to it for the day. Just the songs that come up, the way they make you feel, what you're experiencing with it. We'd like to talk about eating things you are narrowly never eat will then cause the brain signals are new. You have to sort of process what is this new thing. This one is really difficult, especially given the political situation right now, but read political magazines you ordinarily wouldn't read.

Speaker 3:          20:40          Listen to talk radio you ordinarily wouldn't talk to it might not be worth it from the stress level and we understand that, but it's another way. Just taking a totally different information or watch movies you would never watch. Read a book you would never read. Get into a conversation with someone you'd never get into a conversation too and just take in things that are brand new. When you go to home tonight, take a completely different route if you can and just notice what's new. Notice what's different. Change up your routine. Routine is the death of plasticity. You're wanting to just change it up and see what's going on. See what you can bring in that's new, right? I suggest all of you go and visit Olivia if you can and hang out with her chickens and her bs because you probably don't do that very often and watching chickens is actually kind of fascinating. They call it chicken TV and you can just wash them, but they behave in a way you just don't notice. You just don't see. This is one of the reasons you feel more alive when you go on vacation because everything's new and it's popping in your brain. When you're, when the plasticity is going, you feel it. It fundamentally feels good and feels different.

Speaker 3:          21:47          Another piece about this is new information you want to take in. Things you ordinarily would never hear about, would never see, would never do so. Try a sport you've never tried. If you're more physically oriented, ride a dirt bike, go mountain biking in Moab, gone a trap. Ps, be careful. I won't hurt myself terribly on a chat piece, but take in all of these different pieces because the physical reality that you engage in is going straight into your default network and it's causing all kinds of new things to pop. But one of the reasons new information is so incredibly important is because there's this other element to the way that our default network works, and we couldn't get into it in the animation because it was a little too complex. But here's what happens right now. You're paying attention to me, or at least I hope you're paying attention to me, and you're creating memories in your brain and what your hippocampus does, which is what's in charge of creating your memories, is it takes all this information and it kind of puts it on a shelf and it waits to encode it as longer term memories.

Speaker 3:          22:48          And then when you're off task, when you're not really focused, your hippocampus starts to form these memories. Meanwhile, you're off task. So your default network is also activated. All of a sudden your hippocampus does a very strange thing. It takes random shards and combinations of these new memories and it throws them like little sparks into your default network. So your default network has all this information, kind of like building a fire and then your hippocampus throws a new information in as a spark to light it. So if you don't have new information, your default network, your Genius Lounge just keeps spinning on the same stuff. It can't really bus due to something new. This is one of the reasons very often people who have breakthroughs do their work and then also have some kind of hobby, they have something else they're really interested in because that brings in the new information that starts getting things to bang into each other in new and novel ways, in ways they weren't expecting. So if all you do is work, it's going to be that much harder to have that creative breakthrough because you want to bring that new information and from somewhere else, from something else, something that's just different.

Speaker 3:          24:00          So how do you access it? How do you actually get into this mode?

Speaker 4:          24:04          She didn't take it. And Stephanie, for instance, um, one of the ways that we like to explain the importance of plasticity is, um, if you look at a, at a martial artists, so say someone who's doing an actual useful martial arts like Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and knots and sissy practice like karate. Um, you know that once I'm slightly biased, you know that there's one thing that is the actual techniques. What are the moves, how can you roll? And then something completely different, which is the physical conditioning plasticity is like doing cardio. Um, the plasticity on its own won't, isn't necessarily the exact, the exercise for plasticity isn't necessarily the one that will lead you to breakthrough. Just like having a lot more physical power won't necessarily get you to win on the Mat. I was regularly tied into knots by my Sensei who was a shrimp was about this big, right?

Speaker 4:          24:56          He could take on and 85 kilo guy without a problem. But it's part of what will make you better at the final result. So the same way you do cardio it regardless of which, regardless of of which end sport you're going to do, you want to get better plasticity cause it's a good conditioning to then use the breakthrough tools. Am I making any sense? Yeah, please, please, please jump in, ask questions if you have objections raised them. Um, we really encouraged the debate in the moment. There might or might not be a Qa period at the end. So take advantage of it. All yours objections.

Speaker 3:          25:45          So the question was what are good contrasts in terms of your work versus a hobby? What are good ways to create that differentiation so that you get the most out of the new information to get the novel ideas? And so there are two things going on in your question. Some of the things you suggested go to what we have up here, which is accessing, so sleep, walking. These are less hobbies. I like to think of sleep as a hobby. That's a great idea. But these are less hobbies and they're more ways to access your network their way. There are doorways into that sort of mindless state where you're sort of floating and you're not paying too much attention to anything. Then there's an actual hobby where you are focused. So actual hobbies can be anything. Woodworking is great. Watching movies is great. Or reading books, cooking, rock climbing, cycling, it doesn't really matter. Collecting stamps. Yes, I have an objection. Um, personally I've always found, uh, things

Speaker 4:          26:44          that'll wordless are better for the mind wandering. So for example, when you watch a movie, even if it's a movie that you know really well, the verbal center processing center of your brain is still active. Whereas if you're rock climbing, if you're bullish, you're beekeeping, you're usually braiding yourself for the many mistakes you've just done. But if you're climbing, if you're running without music,

Speaker 3:          27:05          okay,

Speaker 4:          27:06          in my experience that just works better because of the lack of a distraction from the verbal processor.

Speaker 3:          27:12          And, and just to be clear, there's no absolute answers to these things. You find your own way. Um, cause I would turn around so I, my mind will wander very often when I'm reading. You ever read the same paragraph over and over and then you're like, oh, I keep reading the same paragraph. It's cause you've mind wandered. So for some people, absolutely the verbal processor completely gets in the way. For other people it just sorta it can shut down. So you're just looking for what works for you and what interests you because you don't want it to be a force. You want it to be something that you actually liked. But the, the key is to give it time, give yourself time to truly do it, give yourself time to truly learn about it because that's going to create new and different information that can then combine with the work you're doing to show you novel new possibilities.

Speaker 3:          27:58          Does that make sense? It does. Thank you. You got it. And so to continue, Oh yes, please. What does meditation fit into all of those? The meditation question. Excellent question. Um, I'll start and then new debated in the book. Just how deep to get into this because it seems like there are some dark sides to many practices have a medic meditation. And so, so meditation, ironically, you would think meditation would put you into that kind of state. However, the majority of meditation practice is actually quiet. Your default network, they actually make it happen. The less one of the reasons is because there's a part of your default network that is all about your Meta awareness. So it's all about what do I think about myself? You ever get caught in a loop thinking bad thoughts about yourself that your default network, this is one of the regions. Depression and creativity get connected very often cause it's the same network in your brain responsible for both. So in meditation quiets that network, it can help you with depression. So at the same time, caveat warning, at the same time, the default network gets strengthened when you're in a meditative state. Literally your gray matter chickens, oh, that's not where I'm going. Where were you going

Speaker 4:          29:21          please? Judah and I have slightly different, um, approaches to, well actually a lot of things, but meditation, I'm the ruthlessly pragmatic one in, um, in this duo. So the way I look at meditation is really like a toolbox. Um, or like a cheese board or something. I'm the same way. You use a hammer or a wrench for the same purpose, the same way that personally I would recommend using metta or Vipassana for the same purpose. It's, it really is the same way where you talk about yoga, it runs the gamut from the 180 degree Celsius Bikram rooms to the uh, you know, hold the mountain pose for three days kind of things. Meditation for me is the same way. It's a toolbox. So it really depends as to what you're going after. And you could be going for emotional healing. You could, you could be going for internal insight.

Speaker 4:          30:14          Um, the way I tend to see it, and there's a lot of push backs is just one personal way of seeing it. Um, from easiest to hardest is how much sedatives you give your monkey mind. So TM, transcendental meditation is a really nice entry point into meditation because it gives you what is direct drugs for the monkey mind, which is words. So you get a mantra to repeat. And in some traditions it's considered sacred and personal. In some other scientific studies, it seems that pretty much any sound that you repeat can have the same effect. Um, but you get some thing mental to focus on in various traditions of the passing of insight, you can focus on any object of meditation, be it the, um, a candle. Your breath is usually the most portable. Um, for a lot of people, like probably us in this room, that's the nice dry, comfortable work of the mind.

Speaker 4:          31:16          And for a lot of us it's easier. Probably most of us in Silicon Valley, it's easier to work on something like insight meditation because it's all in the mind. It's a lot easier than the messy, ugly, uncomfortable work of the heart, which is the realm of, um, practices like metta, loving kindness. Don't lend compassion. Please don't get into, don't learn until you're damn sure you're ready. You're taking on the sufferings of the rest of the world. Um, so if you want to grow your heart, you're going to use one too. If you want to grow your plasticity, you're going to want to go. Or another the caveat I was going into his, um, there are some forms of meditation. Um, I personally would not recommend to beginners. Zen is a good example. People have been known to go into schizophrenia episodes on zen retreats. Have me, if you have ever gone on a silent retreat, please raise your hands.

Speaker 4:          32:06          Okay. For those of you who haven't, please, please, please, please, please consider going on one. There are very few experience of which I would say without the slightest. Second of hesitation, it's a life changing experience. I would say that about going on a silent retreat. Those of you who have gone, has this been your experience? Please feel free to say no if not okay. Now that's an answer. It's really good. I hate silent retreats, but it's kind of like meditation is training for your mind. It's like going to the gym for your mind and usually by two thirds of the way into a meditation retreat, you are certain that you are failing the meditation practices failing this whole idea stupid and you want to go home anyway. And there's a certain arc that you will see your own mind go through. The caveat that I was going into is that meditation can in certain circumstances help you through depression. It can also precipitate depression. Um, so as with any other tool, it's useful to have good mentors, teachers, or they can be in the form of books. Humans, it doesn't matter, but who can guide you along the way so you get sure that you don't get stuck into a vicious cycle that through meditation can actually worsen depression. Am I making sense? Does anyone have any questions? Comments? Objections, please?

Speaker 2:          33:31          Okay.

Speaker 4:          33:32          Yeah. Meditation can in some cases worse than depression, especially if you're on retreat. Yes. But it can also get two out of it. It can also get you out of it. There's a fantastic, if you, if it gets you into it and then gets you out of it, that bones is the nicely. So here you're saying it's an it as if it were a single thing. It's not, you've got first a bazillion different traditions of meditation and each experience we haven't, it's going to be different. Um, there is a book that I recommend very, very, very highly. It's called the mindful way through depression. It is one of the best books I've seen on those two things. But there's um, if you're just starting to meditation, get out of your mind and into your life, but the classic favoritist would be wherever you go. There you are. And those are all really good introductions as to seeing where your mind can take you and learning to drop below the mind. Learning to just because something is in your head doesn't mean it has any validity whatsoever.

Speaker 2:          34:37          Yeah.

Speaker 4:          34:38          Okay. All yours. Okay. One last thing I got there I was just saying is that it, it has been shown to increase the gray matter, matter in your default network and increase the connections. And so what can happen is, even though you may not go into a mind wandering state of creativity while in the meditative state, when you come out, you're kind of charged and ready to be stronger with it. Talk about the guy or vacation, it makes you smarter. Sorry, talk about the guy ratification and it makes you stronger and smarter. It increases the folds in certain parts of your gray matter. And, um, I pronounce the gamification. You might not as what threw me off, it doesn't matter. Go, we have slight differences in pronunciation as he gets it. Um, and the, then the complexity of the folding in that part of your brain is directly related to your, uh, rapidity in processing information. So it literally can make you smarter. You're gonna explain it a lot better. Sound good. Um,

Speaker 3:          35:38          and so the more you're, the more your neurons are closer to each other, the more they're wrapped around each other. More surface area they can get into contact with kind of the way your genes are wrapped up in a ball, the more chances there are for the new connections. So that's why it can improve what's going on. Again, your brain is structural, so as you, as you strengthen the structure of your brain, you strengthen your ability to have these breakthroughs. And so medic, well, meditation is or narrowly not an access point. It's a strengthening point. So it's a plasticity strengthening point. The access points are things like taking naps. Salvador Dali discovered the power of the hypnagogic state when you're just falling asleep and you're in that liminal in between space and other people have discovered the hypnopompic, which is when you're just coming out of it, you know when somebody says sleep on it, that's a real thing because when you go to sleep, your default network starts working on things and right as you're waking up it tends to tell you things.

Speaker 3:          36:33          And so in the book we talked about Adam shy or who's one of the cofounders, a Siri, and this is just a general practice of his, he goes to sleep, focuses on an idea specific problem he has and that's using his executive to site. This is what we're working on. And then he just allows us default network to do its thing in at night. And then when he wakes up, he kind of checks in. He's like, what did it tell me? And it usually told him something. He writes it down, he then gets up, goes to his desk, goes back to his executive network and starts working it out. And you see this happen all the time. Einstein famously went to his friend one day after 10 years in 1905 working on his theories about light and some alternating and time. And he's like, you know what, I give up.

Speaker 3:          37:12          I'm done. And he went home and he went to sleep and he wakes up and Voila, he comes back to see his friend. He's like, I have it. Thank you so much. But here's the thing about breakthroughs. That was in it. He then spent six weeks with his executive function, writing it all out, getting it all straight, so there's this constant back and forth. This is interplay between the two. That is so important and so when you access this mode, you have to also remember to use your executive to focus you on the issue at hand to say, okay, this is what I want to think about. This is what I'm going to do now. I'm going to go take a walk. Now I'm going to go take a nap. Now I'm going to go for a swim. Now I'm just going to sit in this hammock and let myself just sort of wander off.

Speaker 3:          37:50          I'm going to pick up this book, but I'm not going to be, I'm not going to be focused on like finishing the chapter. I'm just going to let myself read the book and see if I kind of wander off, see if something just comes out of it. Or if you're very good at meditating, sit down for a 10 2030 minutes, sit. And then when you come out of it say, I now want to think about this. Go for a walk. Cause you've just sort of done an awesome workout for your default network and it's sort of primed and ready to go. And then you have to let go and let it sort of do its thing. One of the issues with accessing it is because of the world we live in. We live in a world where we are on task all the time. And one of the interesting things is Douglas Rushkoff and author has this fascinating concept where he said, we have all this technology, all these machines and yet we're busier than ever.

Speaker 3:          38:37          Weren't they supposed to make our lives easier? Why is this? And his theory is, is that we have internalized machine time. We actually operate at the pace and rate of the machines that are supposed to be helping us. And so we answer emails at all times of the night. We answer phone calls whenever we're on constantly. And the problem with being on constantly is you never access your default mode. You never accessed the genius lounge, and therefore you never give yourself the chance to have the brilliant ideas to have the great breakthrough. The interesting thing is that to have a true breakthrough, we need to pull back and step into human time. We need to slow down, we need to allow that pace to happen. We operate better. When we do that, we just forget, get overwhelmed and then go, go, go, go, go. And it's not helpful.

Speaker 3:          39:28          So part of the challenge with accessing this is allowing yourself to slow down, is allowing yourself to re enter human time to do things like walk and nap and rest. Aw, the experience of art is a wonderful way to access your network. You just look up at a picture like this and the sheer immensity of it all and how small we are. And we are aware of something larger than ourselves. And the research shows, we just, we open up into a whole different space and we open up our brains into a whole different space and different connections occur, different, different parts of our brains start talking and we just were open to this and this also makes us slow down. You ever see anybody just like running along the rim of the Grand Canyon when you come upon something that produces all, you slow down. When you walk up to a redwood, you slowed down and you just kind of sit there and say, my God, you don't even have to believe in God. And that kind of comes out of your math because we're just aware of this larger entity in the universe. And so go and look out. Even just looking at across the bay, we'll do this or look out at the ocean or go up to the top of Mount Tam and just that just luck. The grand vistas will ignite this in us. We'll bring it out of us.

Speaker 3:          40:52          I want to talk a little bit about constraints and the concept of Wabi Sabi cause constraints can be incredibly helpful when it comes to accessing the sort of breakthrough ability. Wabi Sabi is this Japanese design concepts where you start with the flaw, the flaws, you're your zero point and you integrate it. The flaws not to be gotten rid of the flaws, not a problem. The flaw actually directs the way in which you're going to design. And I love what street artists do with this stuff, right? So a crack in the wall becomes Spider Mans Web and a railing becomes fun for Calvin and Hobbes and this guy is breaking out of jail. And this one, they've turned the, the breaking down of the plaster on the outside wall into a factory and it's a coming out of the smokestack. This kid's having a good time. And here we've got camels making their way in a caravan and all of this is from, they saw a floss, something was wrong.

Speaker 3:          41:44          And then they use that to define how they were going to create the art. And so the question becomes, what's the flaw in your system? What's your biggest obstacle? If you start from that point and not say, how do I get rid of it? But say how is this my start point? It creates all kinds of creative abilities, creative capacities. The flaw acts as sort of the access point into your default network. And so one way you can do this, and you can do this with teams as well as you build a constraint box. And we have found this to be really useful. We did this with Genentech a little bit ago and it was very helpful because they were talking about how annoying the federal regulations were. So we spun it around and we were like, well let's talk about what are the constraints?

Speaker 3:          42:22          And what you do is you start to lay out the constraints, right? Dave is a serious problem for me. So as the FDA, so is the cash flow and it's really not sexy. What we're talking about, it's gonna be hard to get anybody interested in it. So these are some of your constraints and you just get a sense of them. You lay them out so they don't get overwhelming. The next thing you do is you start talking about your assumptions because very often you're assuming things that aren't right that aren't true, and if you don't write them down and look at them, they're just going to stymie you the whole way. So no one's going to listen. Angela hates this idea 18 months to see results. It's cost prohibitive. You just lay it all out there. You look at it and you question all these assumptions. Are they really constraints or are they just things that you've assumed their conversations you haven't had? And the reason you do it in this form is because what happens in the end is it this becomes your solution space. You've now defined where you can be free. You've defined the space where your default network can now try any number of things. So as opposed to these things hemming you in and locking you in, they turn around and free you

Speaker 3:          43:25          because now you know that you don't have to bother looking at those things. You don't have to bother beating your head against them. And now you've got this space that's opened up.

Speaker 3:          43:34          And that freedom is what allows the default network to start to truly function. And so especially when you do this with a team, it's amazing what comes out and why you start finding out. But there are all these assumptions on the table that have stopped people from getting interested in things that weren't even correct in the first place. And little by little people started realize, oh, but you know what we can do? Oh, you know, we can do. And once you're in that space, now your default network is alive and functioning. And so this is one of the way the constraints can act as a really powerful tool to get you into this Roman Mars of 99% invisible, a really fun podcast. He has a great ted talk talking about flags and he's like, you should be able to draw your flag on a three by five note card.

Speaker 3:          44:15          And everybody thinks it's ridiculous and crazy. But he's like, that's one of the best constraints you can have because it's going to drive you to making a really excellent flag and you can use that kind of constraint on anything. Can you express it in a three by five note card? Well then you probably don't understand it well enough. Yes. What do you call it? The default network. Ah, why do I call it the default network? I don't, I'm quoting. Um, when you're on task and doing something, it goes more quiet. When you're off task, your brain defaults to this network. It just, this is where it goes every time. So that's why it's called the default mode network. And one of the funny pieces is that the person who discovered it dark, just dark and Marcus recall to do, okay, we'll leave it alone. The way he figured it out was he was noticing that when he had people in Fmr eyes and told them to just hang on a second, just wait, don't think about anything.

Speaker 3:          45:07          We have to do something over here. All of a sudden all this activities showed up in their brains and everyone was like, oh, it's just static. It's just noise, whatever. And then one day he walks out of a meeting, he's wandering down a hall and it just showed up. The idea showed up. And so what happened was he was thinking about this, he was thinking about this, and then when he was off task, wandering down a hall is default network. The brain defaulted to it and then it gave him an answer to a question he'd been asking, which is, what's up with all this noise? And the FMA? Yes, it's, it's, it's, it's because it's this, it's this place where all these different pieces are coming together and talking to each other and right. And they're just sort of putting things together. So we've discovered it.

Speaker 3:          45:48          It truly is the engine of our creativity. That's what we've been starting to find out. And so these are all just ways you can actually get into it and use it. Focus yourself on it. One of the things, and we talked about this a lot in the beginning of the book, can we give a kitchen recipe for this? Can we say one cup of butter? You know, two eggs, some sugar, some chocolate chips, Vala you'll have a breakthrough. And the answer is no, it's, it's a nonlinear process. It's an emergent process and so you have to give yourself time with it. But what we're teaching you is that you can actually set conditions to make it far more likely that it will happen. Switching, I want to make a slight, a slight switch now to associative thinking, which in the end is truly what your default network is doing. And so I'm going to show you something that will both raise your plasticity but also kind of get into associative thinking. I'm somebody left their GoPro on the ground and a squirrel picked it up.

Speaker 2:          47:18          Okay?

Speaker 3:          47:19          Okay. So I dunno about you, but I've never seen anything like that. That is literally a squirrels I view of the world. And so it does a couple of things. One, it forces this growth of plasticity because you're like, oh my God. It's like it's this big and it's moving on branches you could never move on and it's moving so quickly through the tree. I used to move through trees very slowly and all of this is new and new and new and then at the same time it, it adds to this piece that we call it associative thinking, so all the media about artificial intelligence and how it's going to replace human beings and Yada Yada, Yada. Most people who are aware and know that there's this big leap between where AI is at the moment, which is amazingly good at pattern recognition and the data crunching and the intuitive inferential leaps between ideas and that's something that human beings are still particularly good at and it's the association of the different ideas, what sometimes known as abductive reasoning to have a little bit of data here and then to get a whole theory out of it here and this is what the default mode network gives us.

Speaker 3:          48:19          It is what takes different pieces of data and puts them together and to whole new conceptions, whole new theories. And so having experiences that are completely different. This gets at the hobby idea, brings in the ability to create these associations you might not ordinarily say. So in the same way in the 1970s San Francisco, California, there was a huge drought. People drain their swimming pools, they just looked like empty holes, but a bunch of kids were like, these are skate parks, right? That's something that comes up from the default mode network or the skateboarding kid who wants to be able to keep practicing in winter. So he creates a snowboard and invents snowboarding, or the army has got Lex San, a hard plastic that is used in their windshields of their helicopters and these windshields are getting scratched up like nobody's business and the deserts of Iraq and Afghanistan and in the training at Fort or Irwin in California, and they're spending tens of millions of dollars.

Speaker 3:          49:15          You're placing these lexan very scratchable windshields and lo and behold are these two army reserve, national reserve guardmen who are helicopter mechanics and Nascar fans. And like, well, you know, Nascar, this is the same luck San on there and when she has, but they put these thin mylar sheets on top of them before every race they're called tearaways. And at the end of the race they pull them off. The mylar took all the hits and scratches and the windshield's fine, like, why don't we just put them on the army helicopters. They took it from one place and moved it to another. They associated it save the army tens of millions of dollars because the windshields lifespan doubled and tripled. But it was already there. They associated it, they moved it to another realm. And very often this is how we end up seeing innovation happen. How many of you know Thomas Edison's electric pen?

Speaker 3:          50:03          Exactly. He's not very proud of it either. Wasn't very successful. Ended up in the window of a pawn shop downtown in New York who should be walking by. But this guy, Samuel O'reilly, Samuel O'reilly takes a look at it and he's a pretty clever guy and he's like, I, I think I could change the surround. Samuel O'reilly invents modern tattooing by changing the electric pen, moving things in their context from one context to another is very often where these innovative ideas come from. It's the association and that your default network that's making those associations, that's connecting, that's inferring, that's intuiting between vastly different things.

Speaker 2:          50:43          Yeah,

Speaker 3:          50:45          so there was a young meteorologist whose name I wrote down and I can't remember, it's over here somewhere, I'll get it at the end, but he's up in the Arctic in the early 19 hundreds and something just strikes him that the, the ice kind of looks like jigsaw puzzle pieces and that's it. He just notices that it's like interesting to them. Year later he's looking at a globe. He's like, Huh, you got the continents kind of look like jigsaw pieces. I wonder if they were ever together. And he goes and he checks out the rocks along South America and along Africa and he checks out some of the floor and fun and he's like, I think these things drifted. He invented the concept of continental drift, which eventually took us to plate tectonics. A meteorologist making a breakthrough in geology because I'm an association he made by looking at the ice in the Arctic.

Speaker 3:          51:34          This is very often how it works. This idea of curiosity of noticing the way different things come together and it's the default network. It's mindlessly staring out at the ice and be like, Huh. They look like jigsaw puzzles and then mindlessly staring at a globe and being like, oh, the jigsaw puzzles kind of remind me of the continents. This is where these things come together and that's what I'm saying. It's important to allow ourselves to be off task because we don't allow ourselves to access the network otherwise. So I want you to imagine that gravity stops working at 10:00 PM and then starts working again at 7:00 AM how has our entire culture different?

Speaker 2:          52:09          Okay,

Speaker 3:          52:10          Sas drawing things out, whatever you can come up with. Are there nuts over every house or houses designed more like boats where everything is locked down? Our children's sort of tied to their beds before 7:00 PM how to teenagers play around with this? How do they rebel given this, how do they get in trouble? Given this, how do people throw nighttime parties? What does burning man look like? You could just keep asking yourself this over and over again, and it seems silly, but really it's coming out of the tradition of thought experiments, which Einstein uses. All right? Just playing out what is possible in the universe, what might occur, and one last one I'll show you. The very end is so this,

Speaker 2:          52:58          whoops.

Speaker 3:          53:00          Yeah, this is the world's most boring video unless you put this music over it. Now all of a sudden there's tension and you're probably wondering, did I put a shark fin in? Is there going, is it going to pop up? Are you going to see that fit? Come on, right? Is it just the mouth going pop out? I don't have those skills. This is just like the world's most boring clouds at the window of an airplane, but we put the music on and suddenly your brain's creating a whole universe. You can do this with any receipt in the universe. All right? I'll end the tension. You can literally take any movie scene you want, add music to it and watch how it changes. Watch what happens. I had one group where somebody shouted out last scene of Casablanca and somebody shouted out, we are the champions by Queen, and they thought they had me.

Speaker 3:          53:46          They thought they nailed me and I was a little nervous. I was like, I don't know how this is going to go. So we go to youtube but bring up the Casablanca, put it on mute, we bring up, we are the champions. Turn it on, start the two of them. We start watching and it's shocking how it starts to line up and as the plane starts to take off and else's being taken away, the music is crescendoing and Freddy Mercury going, we the jab and you're like, oh my God, it's so moving and it's totally random and play this game. Literally play this game and it sounds silly, but it's amazing how it sets you up for. Then being able to connect to things you are narrowly would never think would work and that's where those breakthroughs come from. So there's, there's play involved, there's a craft involved, there's practice involved. There are these tools. It's, but it's not something in theory, it's something you do. It's a way you are in the world. And so you have the ability, you have the brain for this, you have all the parts for it. Everybody does. We just have to use them, practice with them, and get comfortable with them. And that's, that's why we wrote the book. See, that's nicer.

Speaker 2:          54:56          Thank you.
