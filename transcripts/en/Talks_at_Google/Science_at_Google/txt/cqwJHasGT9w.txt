Speaker 1:          00:00:06       And I would like to introduce today, Dan Valana manner. He is a computational neuroscientist from Ucla and today today he'll talk about his book. Your brain is a time machine, which you can actually buy a discounted price at this table. And so that was for those of you that comes in.

Speaker 2:          00:00:31       Thank you and thank you for all for coming today. It's a pleasure to be here. So I'd like to talk a bit about time and the brain and the brain and the nature of time. And to get my talk started, I'd like to start by creating a

Speaker 2:          00:00:48       awkward silence. Um, and I'd like to do that to make three points. The first is that your brain is automatically attempting to predict what is about to happen. Your brain as a prediction machine. So right there you are trying to predict what's was about to happen. Maybe you're thinking, oh, he's having an absence seizure. Um, number two, your brain is automatically telling time. The only reason you could notice that pause is because you're creating a temporal expectation of the normal average pause between words and that bio, that temporal pause was violated. And that's when the passage of time came to your attention and that's my point number three, you probably became aware of the passage of time you the subjective feeling of time going slowly because it was a slightly awkward moment and I'm time probably seemed to be going slowly and hopefully um, it wasn't as long as it seemed to be, at least I hope it wasn't because to me it seemed like a full minute.

Speaker 2:          00:01:48       But before we delve in to the mechanisms of how the brain tells time in the meaning of the nature of time, let me for already start off by pointing out that I've used the word time a number of times in this talk already and I assume you know what I mean and I s and you assume I know what the word means, but isn't that the case? Do we, can we actually define time? It turns out, I'm sorry, here, let me get used to clicking this. It turns out that the word time is the most common noun in the English language along with two others that are units of time, year and day. So on. This is an obvious indication of how important time is in our lives. Um, but it's a bit ironic that the most common noun in the English language is one that we really can't define.

Speaker 2:          00:02:36       It's been embarrassing action, isn't it? Um, so this brings us to the problem. How do we define time? And people have struggled with this for a long, long time. So, um, a thousand, 600 years ago, Saint Augustine said, what then is time if no one asks me, I know what it is. If I wish to explain it to me, what you asks, I do not know. Um, a thousand, 600 years later, the great physicist Richard Fineman, who's not wanting to give up easily on problems, basically gave up and said, maybe it's just as well we faced the fact that time is one of those things we probably cannot define what matters anyways is not how we defined time, but how we measure it. Um, but it was probably the author Douglas Adams that gave us the most important definition of time. Time is an illusion. Lunchtime. Doubly so. Um, so part of the problem is that the word time really means different things.

Speaker 2:          00:03:33       Right? And let me give you this rather contrive sentence to make that point. Einstein's talk on the nature of time, um, started on time but seem to last a long time. Um, okay. So first the nature of time, so that refers to the physics of time is time a full blown dimension as in um, the four dimensions of time is only the present, uh, exist is time. A abstraction that we scientist used to help us understand the universe. Second started on time. That's clock time. That's the easiest time to define right. That's um, time is defined as what clocks town as circular as that definition is. It's a really useful one and probably the most important in that it got all of us here on time. Um, the last one is the subjective feeling of time. So it seemed to last a long time and um, that's tightly linked law on linked to the problem of consciousness.

Speaker 2:          00:04:28       So in that sense, the subjective sense of time is also a very difficult problem to address. Now starting with the first question, um, the brain is, um, time is really important to how the brain works. So, and this is why I consider in many ways the brain to be, if you will, a time machine. And there's four reasons for that. The brain is a machine that tells time, the brain generates the subjective feeling of the passage of time, the brain attempts to predict the future. The brain is a remembers the past in order to predict the future. And finally the brain allows us to project ourselves mentally, mentally project ourselves into the pastor of the future is something we called mental time travel. And this is really important for, um, our ability to interact with the world in terms of what's makes humans unique is our ability to engage in mental time travel.

Speaker 2:          00:05:26       And we'll talk a bit more about this, but first, consider the first issue here. The brain is a time machine. So the brain tells time across 12 orders of magnitude from microseconds at the lower end over there too. Um, down here, which you're using right now to four sound localization. So your brain picks up the tens or hundreds of microseconds delays it takes to sound to arrive from my left ear to my writing by picking up the Delta t's, the relative time, delays their time, perception in speech, um, eyes on the order of hundreds of milliseconds and seconds. Music, motor coordination is happening on this range of time perception. And we'll delve more into that and then we have time estimation, um, which is sort of what most people think of when we talk about their sense of time. How long has, um,

Speaker 2:          00:06:17       how long has this talk been lasting? How long has the light red light been waiting to change and so forth. And find the, you have your circadian rhythms and that everybody's familiar with in terms of controlling your clock, when to get out in the morning and went to go to bed now. So how does the brain tell time? So to answer that question, it's useful to think about timing and these different scales. So, for example, in language, a couple of examples here are if I say something like they gave her cat food or they gave her cat food, right? So there you're using the pause and speech, um, to determine this, the content of the meaning of the sentence. And by the way, this is something that artificial speech, um, systems, um, still struggle with a bit. This is one of the challenges and it's because of some of the mistakes that I'm, there's still made even with the most advanced systems. Now another example here is in music. And now I'm going to play to you a piece of music. And the task here is it's a hybrid piece of music and see if it reminds you of anything. But the time has been altered. And I know some of you are here at the beginning and you probably saw the next slide here. So you're going to have to keep quiet. But, um, Google please play music here.

Speaker 2:          00:07:40       So does this remind you of any piece of music you know of?

Speaker 2:          00:07:49       So I'll give you a hint. You guys are young crowd, but it's from a group called the Beatles. Um, does it remind anybody? Does that ring a bell to anybody? Can anybody pick up what that was? Yup. Okay. Very good. Anything else? Anybody else pick the reminder? Any other song? So that's a hybrid song there. So what that was was the notes. So you're paying more attention to the notes. The melody of I'm yellow submarine, but it was the timing of yesterday. So we sort of did a hybrid crossing of the spatial information and the temporal information. So sometimes people pick up a bit more on the temporal structure. Sometimes people pick up more on the melody. But this is just to make the obvious point that without time and ability to perceive and to tell time, um, music of course wouldn't exist. And indeed it's in this scale of tens to hundreds of milliseconds that time. Is that, um, most important. So in the context of the lab, for example, one question we ask is whatever mechanisms are they in your brain that allow you to tell time, can they improve with practice? Um, so we often ask in studies where we do an interval discrimination studies to tell us what is the first or second interval, the longest Google, please play music.

Speaker 2:          00:09:12       So there's a simple intervals, discrimination task. And the question is, was the first or second longest? And the first was a hundred milliseconds and the second interval was 150 milliseconds. Now if you have some timer in your brain that's fixed like a watch, maybe it doesn't matter, maybe you can't get better at that. But if you practice and that timer improves, then you should be able to pick that up. And we do, and we can tell here that in the 100 millisecond case, that's what you just heard. People improved dramatically with practice. But interestingly, if you had a clock in your brain that was your master clock, you'd also get in that clock was somehow improving. You should get better at all intervals. So you should also get better at 50 millisecond interval of the 200 millisecond interval or the 500 millisecond. But you don't.

Speaker 2:          00:09:59       So this is a bit strange, right? It's almost as if you have multiple clocks in your brain, you have an array of different clocks that can tell time across different time ranges. So how does the brain do that? Or where in the brain does the brain, um, what parts of the brain responsible for timing. Fortunately, we know exactly what part of the brain tells time and that's this part right here, right beside locality and music conveniently located. Um, this of course is nonsense. Um, but this friend, a logical view of time never lasts, is surprisingly influential, um, in how people think about times. So people do still think about time, even today in the sense that you might have a central clock in your brain. So the office of this faculty is to mark the passage of time, duration, succession of events, et Cetera. It ultra remembers dates, keeps correct time and music and dancing and induces to punctuality in the fulfillment of engagement.

Speaker 2:          00:10:54       So this is an extreme view of what you'd call a central clock or a master clock in your brain. We know that this is not correct. The brain has multiple ways to tell. Time is multiple areas in the brain that are involved in telling time. So understand how the brain tells time. Let's first remind ourselves how man made clocks actually work. So manmade clocks, um, despite their complexity all work for the most part under an embarrassingly simple principle. And that's just an Oscillator, your time base and a counter. So whether you're talking about a pendulum clock or a quartz crystal, or even an atomic clock in which you're using the period of the electromagnetic vibrations, um, to tell time, you're just counting the ticks of an oscillator. So it's reasonable to ask, is that how the brain tells time? The answer is no. So as quote from Einstein reminds us, any physical phenomenon may be used as a clock provided it can be exactly repeated as many times as desired.

Speaker 2:          00:12:01       So here we have raindrops falling on a pond. And if I asked you which raindrop fell first, the up one over here or down here, you could tell me this raindrop fell first. And if we were so inclined and knew a bit of physics, we could even calculate the interval. So the point is is that even this static image has information about time. And that's because physical systems that have dynamics naturally tell time. I mean that's essentially what dynamics is. Dynamics is the change in time. So the idea is is that the brain uses its own dynamics as one way to tell time. So neurons are the computation element of the brain. And neurons have their axons, they have, I'm sorry, they have their dendrites and the axons down here, the axons of one neuron can come over and synapse on the dendrites of another neuron.

Speaker 2:          00:12:55       And that's where they make a synapse. It releases transmitter here and creates a bioelectrical signal that travels towards the Soma of the postsynaptic neuron. So if you have these elements and they're connected to each other, one way we could make a time or clock, if you will, is to connect them in a chain. So if we had one neuron that was connected to another, connected to another, connected to another, connected to another, we can now see that we'll have this temporal pattern of activity in which one neurons activates the next, activates the next, next, I mean it's the next. So you know that if this neuron is active, that eight or nine, 10 units, um, time units have elapsed. So indeed it seems that one way the brain tells time on the scale of tens to hundreds of milliseconds to seconds is through neural dynamics. Um, and we know this in part due to research, um, on a number of studies on both humans and animals and one animal that knows how to time very well our songbirds.

Speaker 2:          00:13:58       So these are zebra finches and um, they sing, and I won't play you their song here, but this is the spectrogram of a zebra finch song. And I'm not too different from speech in which this is our frequency access. This is of course time and these are the syllables of the song. And they can sing this hundreds and hundreds of time pretty faithfully, where you could almost overlay each song on top of each other. When scientists record from neurons in an area of the Zebra finch brain, um, they can record from many different neurons. So here the recording from 136 neurons, and here we're just showing the activity when those neurons spike and aligning them in time. And so some neurons spike early on, some neurons spike later and so forth. So you have sort of this chain of activity in which seems to be the brain's clock for the song at least.

Speaker 2:          00:14:49       So some neurons telling it's the beginning of the song, middle of the song and so forth. So you have these complex patterns, neural dynamics. Now in a more complex network, and this is a simulation here. Um, and normally I wouldn't show the simulation, but here because I'm at Google and there's a strong interest in on AI and machine learning. I'll give you an example of a simulation of a recurrent neural network in which, um, you're simulating neurons and these neurons are connected to each other. And, um, actually curl, I'm going to act, I forgot. There's one more s button I'm going to have to ask Google depressed in a minute. Um, so, um, and when you do this, this network is going to do um, a speech recognition task, a speech transcription task. So the network will listen to a spoken degette and then transcribe that pattern in time. So can Google, can you still start that movie please?

Speaker 2:          00:15:51       So what you'll see here, I'll show point over here. So that's the spectrogram and this is the activity in the neural network. So this is the activity of different neurons and this is driving that activity. And that activity here is driving. So there's not much hidden here. Unlike say a deep learning network, which drives a lot of series power. Of course, this is the whole thing happening right here. This network is driving this and processing this stimulus. There's around 4,000 units in this. So in contrast, a deep network in which you have millions. So, um, that was an fast eight in the next eight will be slower

Speaker 3:          00:16:28       a.

Speaker 2:          00:16:30       So that was a slower eight. And the point here is that by encoding time in these trajectories in the dynamics of these neural networks, it naturally solves the problem of what we call temporal and variants. The issue of how you can recognize a song or speech, whether it's spoken very quickly or very slowly. So overall, as far as we know, one of the major computational strategies, the brain has to process time varying information, which is most of the information you'd passing right now. Speech of course, is through neural dynamics, sister changing patterns of activity. Now we all know that whatever the clocks that are within our brain is sometimes they're accurate, inaccurate. So there's a mismatch between objective time and subjective time. And um, this leads to temporal illusions or temporal distortions everybody's familiar with, with, um, time flies when you're having fun. And to go back to a quote from Henry James, which was, um, from his magnum opus principles of psychology or in over a hundred years ago, he says in general, a time filled with varied and interesting experiences seems shore in passing, but long as we look back, on the other hand, attractive time, empty of experiences seems long in passing.

Speaker 2:          00:17:54       But in retrospect, short, so some people refer to this as the vacation paradox. You're, you're having fun in eighth and in Athens for the first day and um, you're seeing a lot of new sites, meeting New People and time seems to fly by prospectively. So as it's happening, as it's playing out prospectively, um, your estimates of time are on the, a short amount of time has elapsed even though it might have been a long period of time. But retrospectively, as you look back, that's not so much a timing task, but a memory task. You're thinking of back of the number of items or you're influenced by the number of items in memory. So if you have it filled day in which a lot of, um, interesting things were happening, you're going to have a lot of memories of that event and left with the impression that it was a long period of time.

Speaker 2:          00:18:46       Elapsing now in contrast, if you're bored or anxious, then, um, as time is going by prospectively, um, you might overestimate the amount of time it seems like a lot of time has been, I'm going by, so you're stuck at the airport and um, you're on a six hour wait because of a plane delay and time is dragging, right? You're bored out of your mind retrospectively when you look back upon your trip, that's merely merely a blip in your conscious experiences. Right? So because, um, you know, the Atlanta bathroom is only so interesting and it didn't, um, store too much information about that wonderful experience, um, in your memory banks. So you have, we have this paradox between prospective timing in retrospect of timing, which, um, in part influences our ability to tell time. Now, everybody has also known about cases under sort of extreme danger or um, extreme stress situations in which people report time actually slowing down or things happening in slow motion.

Speaker 2:          00:19:59       And um, so this is a report of a race car driver who, um, was whose car was thrown into air, spun around in the air. He obviously survived and um, later gives this report. It seemed like the whole thing took forever. Everything was in slow motion and it seemed to me like I was a player on a stage and could see myself tumbling over and over in the car. It was as though I sat in the stands and saw it all happening. So here obviously it's not only their impression of the passage of time that is being altered right space as well. I think this is probably best described as an hallucination. So this is an altered state, um, in which our sense of time and sense of body sense of space has been dramatically altered. So I think this, the mystery here is not so much what happens these states, but what happens in the normal strength that gives us or our impression of the passage of time now disability to tell time and perceive the passage of time, estimate how much time has elapsed is not unique to humans in any way.

Speaker 2:          00:21:04       Um, all animals are, most animals certainly have the sense of the time of day. They know they have circadian clock, they can learn when food will arrive, um, and so forth. What is unique and humans, however, is probably our ability to engage in what we call mental time travel. So we can think about the past and relive our memories and we experience things that we have already experienced. Um, and sort of study that, right? We can learn, we can reimagine a conversation we had. We can give it alternate endings to test out whether we should have said something different, um, or not. But even more importantly, we can imagine the future. We can project ourselves into the future and simulate the future in our heads. And some people believe that this is indeed why consciousness involved evolved, so the consciousness, a way to simulate the future and and this is what makes humans humans, right?

Speaker 2:          00:22:03       Whether it's your ability to the first person to carve a knife or a weapon out of an obsidian stone must have had something in mind. What am I going to use this for? So this ability to think about what this will be used for in the future seems to evade the ability of most animals. So you take one of the most important inventions of humankind agriculture, right? It's a hard concept and we take for granted, right? I'm going to plant something now and reap its benefits that are going to guarantee survival a year from now. This ability to link sure to link cause and effect actions across large Delta t's long periods of time is very unique to humans. I've always wondered if if humans are only the only species that have figured out the relationship between sex and pregnancy, right? That's a fairly long period of time to just can other animals grasp that relationship because it spans periods of weeks or months.

Speaker 2:          00:23:01       Now looking into the future can be a bummer, right? Because the first humans to really see the future in rasp saw something they probably didn't like. Right. And, um, this might have been, by the way, a good time to invent religion when you first started. See understanding what the future holds. And I think this point is, um, beautifully made by, um, harsher Luis, but barges to be a mortal is common place except for man, all creatures are immortal for their ignorant of death. So certainly seeing into the longterm future, um, is what characterizes our species in many ways. Um, but it also has, um, affect our culture in many ways and how we cope with what we've seen now. Um, just because humans are uniquely able, and I'm sorry, there's a quantity. One more button I'm going to need pressed over there for the next movie.

Speaker 2:          00:24:02       Um, I didn't look far enough into the future to anticipate this. Sorry. Um, so, um, just because human beings are uniquely able to engage in mental time travel, it doesn't mean we're actually particularly good at it. Right. And, um, so learning to delay gratification and learning to withhold immediate rewards for, um, longer term benefits is something our species is uniquely able to do. But it's also something we struggle with. So here's the gratuitous child, cute baby video of the talk. You can start that please. And this is the famous marshmallow experiment on that plane. Doesn't look like it's going to play here. Um, oh, we're probably okay. Just pride pressing. Enter something there.

Speaker 2:          00:24:57       That's okay. We'll do it without it. Um, we'll do it with do without the gratuitous video of kids eating marshmallows. Um, so the marshmallow experiment, as many of you probably know, is an experiment in which they say they get four or five year olds in saying, okay, here's one marshmallow. Um, you can eat it now or you can wait until I come back and then you're going to get two marshmallows. And, um, this ability to delay gratification is indeed part of what it means to grow up, to be able to withhold your immediate gratification, um, for later reward. And these studies later showed these studies by, um, alter Michelle at Stanford. Um, that started in the 70s, and he later track down many of these children and he found a correlation, a weak correlation, but correlation nevertheless with their ability to withhold, to wait to withhold gratification, um, at the young age with later on sat scores.

Speaker 2:          00:25:58       Um, so there's indeed there's many pieces of evidence that there's a correlation between what we call temporal discounting or ability to postpone or patients with, um, with health issues as well. So, um, the major issue there of course is that much of what we do is contingent upon our understanding that what we do now has consequences in the future and going to school, saving for retirement, um, exercising are all things that we take for granted but are implicitly contingent on our understanding of temporal relationships, right, of longterm temporary relationships. But many of the problems we face as individuals and as members of society arise from not doing that well enough temporal myopia. So personal credit card debt, exercising uni healthy, not saving enough for retirement or things at the individual level, which we struggle with in order to balance our short term gratification with long term rewards.

Speaker 2:          00:27:10       At the more, I'm not at the sort of societal levels fader to adjust climate change, underfunded pension plans, national debt are things that a societal level or merge in part because of our failure to take appropriate actions in the present to assure or guarantee a better quality of life or health in the future. Now humans as a sin are uniquely able to think about the longterm future. So how did that come about? What's unique about the human brain that gives us the ability to understand the fundamental difference between the past, present, and future, and to plan for months, years, or even decades ahead? So some people have argued that we do that in part because of our ability to talk in language and because of the, uh, and use language and our brain's ability to coopt to the parts of the brain that are used to understand space.

Speaker 2:          00:28:18       The idea is, is that there's areas in the brains of most mammals that allow them to navigate and understand space in a manner of speaking. And maybe the human brain co-opted those same structures, um, to allow us to understand time. And one argument in favor of this is that a lot of the ways we talk about time is by using spatial men metaphors. So I might say it was a long day or I'm looking forward to the clips or you're thinking, I hope this talk shortly. So we're using spatial metaphors to talk about time and um, so, um, this idea of the spatialization of time is really one of the main ways we talk and discuss, um, and understand time. And another way to exemplify this is with what we call the Wednesday question. So I'll say our Wednesday meeting was moved forward two days, what day is our meeting on Monday or Friday?

Speaker 2:          00:29:29       So there's no right or wrong answer there, but it does reflect two different perspectives we have about time. So if you view time as sort of fixed and you're the one walking through time and you're moving, then you'd say you move something forward and from Wednesday it might go to Friday. That's sort of what we call an ego moving perspective. But if we have a time moving perspective, you're probably in the Monday group in which your static and like a river flowing time is like a river flowing towards you and that then the meeting would be on Monday. So there's these two different perspectives that people have, uh, have about time and they just reflect the ambiguity of language and the fact that we spatialized time within our brains. Um, now this idea of the spatialization of time that time is laid out in space is, is very deep in the philosophical literature as well as in physics because there's sort of two diverging theories as to the true nature of time.

Speaker 2:          00:30:40       One is precisely this, that time is a dimension, much like space. So this is called eternalism and internal ISM under eternal wisdom. The past, the present and the future are all equally real now is perfectly arbitrary now as our, as arbitrary as here, just like here is a perfectly valid point in space to be, I'm perfectly fine with you being over there in time now is arbitrary and I should be perfectly fine in internal ism. Time is not always perfectly arbitrary. And other versions of me or other versions of you if you will, are at past moments or present moment. So everything is equally real and I'm under presentism in contrast, and this is sort of the more intuitive sense we have in that only the present is real. So the past was real. Some configuration of the universe that we call past and now exists on the inner memories is real, was real, the present is real in the future.

Speaker 2:          00:31:45       Some configuration of the universe at some future point will become real based on what's happening in the present. So of course it Turnell ism sort of justifies a talk or a debate about whether time travel is possible. Does nothing to do with the physics of time travel, whether you can actually do it or not. But it Turnell ism justifies the debate because at least there's moments in time that exist that you could potentially try to travel to under presentism. The talk of time travel is a moot point because there's nowhere to go. There's no wind to go to be more precise. Um, now it terminal ism is sort of to the degree that there is a standard view in physics is the standard view. And this is in part because of Einstein's theory of special relativity. So let me just try to convey, I find, um, I find presentism to meet be much more intuitive.

Speaker 2:          00:32:45       I think it's more consistent with our experience, but we believe in eternal wisdom, at least in the physical sense for very good reasons. So let me try to convey those reasons or one of those reasons. So to do this, let me go over a thought experiment, an Einsteinian thought experiment in which we have the following set up. We have an observer on a stationary platform and a train going by and a ludicrously impossibly fast speed of two thirds. The speed of light 0.6, seven times the speed of light. There's an individual in the middle of the train that's shooting these space age bullets towards the front and the back of the train. Now if you're this individual, it doesn't matter because of the laws of physics and relativity that you're moving or not. So you're going to shoot the bullet forward and the sh bullet backwards, and those bullets have to travel the same distance at the same speed.

Speaker 2:          00:33:50       So this pane of glass will break at the same time as that pane of glass. Now, okay, so this person should observe that plane of glass breaking at the same time as this person was. Now here you're the observer and you're going to see the train traveling at a high speed. You're going to see this bullet traveling in the opposite direction at the same speed. So this bullet we'll have speed zero will have a loss of the zero. So basically this bullet will be going, um, we'll just be standing in mid air as the back of the train runs into the bullet. Okay? That's pretty straightforward. Now this forward bullet should be going at the speed of the bullet plus the speed of the train. Now the speed of the bullet is two thirds speed of light. The speed of the train is two thirds speed of light.

Speaker 2:          00:34:37       So the sum of those is 1.3 times the speed of light. Okay? That's a no, no. Right? We can't go faster than speed of light. That's why Einstein told us. So there's something goofy that's going to happen here. This bullet can't be traveling as fast as it needs to be. Going to break this pane of glass at the same time. So we see the bullet in motion approaching the panes of glass and the person on the train will observe both panes breaking at the same time. There'll be breaking simultaneously, but the person on the stationary train on the stationary platform will not see that happen and it has nothing to do with delays or the time it takes information to get from here to there. Okay? This is just based on all those adjustments and delays being taken into account. So this person will observe a different reality while this person has a reality in which both pre panes of glass break at same time for this person's reality, this, there'll be a moment in time where this is broken, but that is not.

Speaker 2:          00:35:46       So this is taken as an argument. This lack of absolute simultaneity is taken an argument for the block universe or for eternalism. So why is that? So let me give it again, run that through you with this example here. So let's look at this sort of our mini block universe with four dimensions. But we're going to own the plot to instead of the three spatial dimensions, we only have one. And we have this temporal dimension dimension. So the, for the person on the train, this is their plane of simultaneity. There's a moment where both panes of glass at the back of the chain and at the front of the train are both intact. There's another moment in exactly the same moment. We're both panes of glass break. Then there'll be another moment in time where both glad panes of glass are ultra already bumpkin. So these are the planes of simultaneity, um, for the person on the train.

Speaker 2:          00:36:40       Now the person on the platform, um, the, in reality, the person on the platform is, is, is in our analogy not moving, which is the same thing as from the perspective of the person on the train. That person on the platform is moving in the opposite direction. So if we just for reasons here, this is going to be easier to explain that way. So the person on the platform is sort of traveling in the opposite direction of the person on the train. Now these planes of simultaneity don't match up for the person on the platform. So the plane of simultaneity, special relativity, Einstein's theory of special relativity tells us that these moments will be the same on these persons clock. So there'll be a moment where the front pain is not broken in the back one is. So the point is is that it's as if the universe, everything that can happen has already happened.

Speaker 2:          00:37:35       And the reason some things appear simultaneous for one person and not for another is a question as perspective. So here the idea is is from this person's perspective, these events are aligned but not for this person. So this is one of the arguments for it to journalism or the block universe. Now there's a clash here, right? If this is true, it sort of leaves our impression of the flow of time as an illusion because if everything has already happened, the clear subjective feeling that time is flowing would seem that it has to be an illusion, a certain sense. And, and um, physicists have long been aware of this. So this seems, this is a quote from Roger Penrose. It seems to me that there's a severe discrepancy or there's serve your discrepancies between what we consciously feel concerning the flow of time and what are theories assert about the reality of the physical world.

Speaker 2:          00:38:29       It's another good quote by Herman Veil, a physicist from the mid 19 hundreds. The objective world simply is it does not happen only to the gays of my consciousness crawling upward along the world line of my body. Does the section of the world come to life as a fleeting image in space, which continuously changes in the time. So they're getting to this issue that the illusion that the flow of time must be an illusion. So this severely clashes with the neuroscience of time and she clearly sees fields that the subjective experience of time is flowing by. Um, now the question is, is if this is consistent with our experience of consciousness, now we don't really know what consciousness is. So this is a very difficult question to, uh, to address. But consciousness probably isn't what it seems to be in the sense that it seems to be providing a linear narrative of what's happening in the world around us.

Speaker 2:          00:39:34       Rather, the unconscious mind seems to be creating this narrative in chunks and then feeding this into the conscious mind or creating the conscious mind, if you will, um, to create a convenient and apparent flow of what's happening. So there's a couple of illusions that show this. It's a bit of a hard concept to explain, but let me just try to give you a quick example here. I'm going to say two sentences and just pay attention to the meaning of the sentences. So the first sentence is the mouse pad was beside the computer. Second sentence, the mouse was hungry. So in both of sentences, the meaning of the word mouse was very different. Right? So I think you're able to understand that in the first case, the mouse referred to an object, um, the computer pad, mouse pad, and the second, um, you know, to erosion, but the meaning of mouse could only be determined by the words that came after.

Speaker 2:          00:40:31       You can't impossibly interpret that sentence in real time. The mouse pad or the mouse was hungry. So what comes after has to influence your interpretation of what came before. So this is one of the lines of evidence that suggests that our conscious experience is not so much a continuous linear flow of the world around us, but of a creation that is generated in sort of fits and bursts of, um, of interpretation of what's happening around us. So it may be the case that our understanding of consciousness may or may not be compatible with the standard view in physics. I think Steven pinker was, was hinting at this when he stated matter is extended in space, but consciousness exists in time as surely as it proceeds from I think too, I am. So we have to decide and I think physicists and neuroscientists to collaborate more to decide if we should view our subjective sense of the passage of time as an empirical observation about the universe.

Speaker 2:          00:41:45       One that has to be explained by physics or if it's an illusion in the deepest sense of the world and thus one that doesn't have to be explained by physics, but then has to be explained by neuroscience. How does the brain generate the conscious subjective feeling of something that has no correlation in the physical world that is of the flow of time now, um, to address these questions, I think we have a long way to go. And neuroscience is a very unique field, neuroscience, so unique field in all of sciences because neuroscience is the only field in which the Oregon or the thing being studied is also doing the study. And this raises a couple of potential concerns, right? And not least of which, well, and is that even possible? Can something understand itself? It's of course, way too early to say to answer that question.

Speaker 2:          00:42:41       Um, but as scientific fields evolve, as they mature, part of that maturation process is to progressively embrace time. You look at, um, what I would consider the first field of modern science, uh, geometry. Geometry is formalized by Euclid 2000, 300 years ago. Um, it was highly influential and transformative. But why was it the first field of science? Well, it was the first field of science because science is easier if you can ignore time. That's what geometry is, right? Geometry is the study of space and objects that don't change in time. It was on the round 2000 years after Euclid when, um, people such as Galileo and Newton came along and fully integrated time into time and dynamics into physics. Same thing in biology. You think about biology up in 17 hundreds, most of the 18 hundreds. It was largely texts a, not tech, sonic, economic and fairly static.

Speaker 2:          00:43:40       And then Darwin playing the role of Galileo said, hey, um, species are dynamic. They change, they adapt, they evolve in time. I think neuroscience is only reaching this renaissance now where it's fully, I'm beginning to embrace time and realize that the brain is in a sense a temporal Oregon. It's a time machine, if you will. It tells time, it remembers the past to predict the future. It allows us to mentally time travel and creates the subjective sense of the flow of time. So elucidating how the brain tells time represents and conceptualize this time is critical to understanding the human mind and the nature of consciousness. Thank you very much.

Speaker 3:          00:44:19       [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:44:28       all right. Have a question

Speaker 4:          00:44:32       or several gear. Yeah. Uh, yeah. First question, it's about the, your claim that humans are unique pay in the sense that the week I'm foreseeing the future, but there has been a lot of studies in I most like spitting on monkeys where they can plan for the day, whether they're going to do that. They wake up every morning and they, they go and get some fixed. If they don't go for the things, they will just stay awake later. Um, so it's, it's kind of like weak argument with the ugs made it. What sense do you,

Speaker 2:          00:45:06       it's called mental time travel. And the debate about whether other animals can engage in mental time travel is an active one. What's there's no debate about is the extent to which humans can engage in mental time travel. So no other animal can talk about plans five years in the future because no other animals can conceive or can communicate about that. But interestingly, the best animal data and the possibility of Thai of mental time travel in the animals, it's not for monkey. So the monkeys data is fairly debated. The people, the major test people use there is if monkeys can learn to use money because monkey money is something that implicitly requires. This has no value. This has no value, right? Paper has no value. It only has value because I assume that in the future I can exchange it for something better. So they tried to teach monkeys, apes, great apes to use money by changing for tokens and they can sort of get it to hang.

Speaker 2:          00:45:56       But this is highly debated. But so that data's still controversial, but the best data actually comes from birds. Um, and there's corvids scrub jays that the best argument comes from. They can seem to, if they're all in, oh, always exposed to one part of their [inaudible] area in the morning and one part in the afternoon. They seem that they can plan ahead by putting the food in the part of the morning, a varium, um, and not in afternoon name. So this is an active field, the debate. Um, but um, part of the debate is, is just one of extent. Um, and humans clearly can, can cross years and centuries now other animals can.

Speaker 4:          00:46:41       Yep. Another question. You were mentioning this kind of view, we'll be doing the condominium, that fiscal explanation, the deck, the foundation of where we stand with time as we move forward. Uh, but there is like a physical sense where you can put that can Arrow of time, the, these all the sons, all of entropy like university validity. So they're just like an objective physical sense. You can say that the pain that moves forward not kind of,

Speaker 2:          00:47:14       so in the block universe, everything is already laid out, but there's still an Arrow of time. Um, because there's a forward Arrow in which things go one way and not the other way. As you probably know, the laws of physics are time asymmetric. You can run Newton's equations or Einstein's equations or even Schrodinger's equation, forwards or backwards. There's no time. So the typical explanation to address the Arrow, the Arrow of time is as you brought up the entropic era, that entropy increases now and to be by itself doesn't explain there. What it does is just say it provides any symmetry. The real explanation comes from the fact that the universe seems to have started in a state of low entropy. And from there it can only go up. But the tricky thing about entropy is if I say there's a state of medium entropy here that predicts that the next time step it should be higher. But if you think about it, it also predicts that the previous time step should be higher. So then tropic Arrow is sometimes called the bi directional arrow. That doesn't explain the ire of time by itself. It needs to be coupled with an assumption about a lower initial stage.

Speaker 4:          00:48:31       Um, so first of all, and I'm not saying this to person who anyone, but I'm an atheist, but when I look at the, uh, the, uh, eternalism worldview that block the lock world, you know, we can look at a person as a baby in a person, as an adult and practically or all or all cells have their body have since died and been replaced. They are, and there's, that's a topic in itself like what makes me me like, like I feel like design, but, but if I look at the block universe, um, as, as you depicted it, um, and say, okay, space and time is all there is and, and, and it all exists already, then it brings about a philosophical question of what links the slice where I was a baby in this slice, where I'm in the adult to create a consciousness that views both as the same thing. Right? So it almost suggests bend the additional layer. No,

Speaker 2:          00:49:30       no, no. I think you, the question of consciousness is perplexing either way, whether what makes you you or makes me mean what consciousness is. I think that's a dilemma. A challenge to science, whether you're participating, whether you subscribe to the turtles, fewer the present dispute, right? Consciousness. We can't explain either way. But I think there's a further challenge of, um, posed by the journalist view when it comes to consciousness in terms of if things aren't flowing, changing in a dynamic fashion, why do we have this clear, distinct feeling? And more importantly, what's the evolutionary function of feeling time change if there's no correlate with the actual universe, it's not like something we perceive color, right? Color is the creation of the human mind, right? Because there's no color in the physical world. There's wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation. We interpret that as color, but that has a very strong adaptive value. So there's a there. So the question is, is if we see if we feel time flowing, but it actually doesn't, what's that function from an evolutionary perspective? And I think that's the mystery that will probably have for awhile.

Speaker 2:          00:50:40       Hi. Thanks for coming. Uh, so what's the difference between the mental time travel and like fantasy, uh, you know, like telling myself a story about the future. What I mean is like an example is I could tell myself a story that I will go to the store later and it will be open. Um, but that might not be so, so is there like a probability element wrapped up in there or, I think the question, interesting question is, could we even have stories if we couldn't have mental time travel? Can other animals have stories? And whether that story takes place in the future or the present or the past, right? You haven't gone later on and we're going to go to the museum. Um, and so is that a story? Is that a plan or is that a fiction? So what makes humans unique, I believe is that what makes us creative is this fine line between stories and reality.

Speaker 2:          00:51:36       So if, if I'm primitive man and it's a story, oh, I wish I could, um, hunt down a, um, a mammoth, you know, is that a story? But then you're thinking, well, if I had a weapon, maybe I could. So this marriage of the stories and reality I think is probably what's driving much of our technology and creativity is this very delicate balance between getting the stories just so that it sounds like fiction, but it's fiction we can create in the future. Sure. Yeah. I would just say we're almost always wrong. Absolutely. Until we've seen a repeatable path. That sounds good. I, I certainly feel that I'm almost always wrong, I assume pumped and people are often right. But, um, yeah, I mean there's trial and error and stochasticity in there. Absolutely. And we can't know in advance. It's so, so if the future hasn't been laid out, clearly we don't have access to it. All right. Thanks. You're welcome.

Speaker 4:          00:52:40       Thanks so much for, this is great. Thank you. Um, are you familiar with the, um, Donald Hoffman? No. Uh, he's, um, he's like a physicist, philosopher. He's got interesting theories about consciousness. The fact is I'm probably gonna Butcher this theory, but I think essentially it's that consciousness is the base of reality and everything else was like on top of it. So he claims to have proven that, uh, what is it? Like everything we know, everything we see is just based on like is this will be reconstructed because it was evolutionary missionary adaptable. It was like a good thing for us. Do you think time could be something similar to that?

Speaker 2:          00:53:21       So there's this very interesting debate about whether time is so some fields or hypotheses and physics are trying to get rid of time. So say that time doesn't exist. Um, and what this means is that time is not a property. They're not saying that time clock time doesn't exist. What they're saying is that time isn't a fundamental property of the universe. It's not like energy or matter. Um, and that time is simply an abstraction of creation of the human mind. The way earn smock put this is it's utterly impossible to measure change by time because time is an abstraction at which we arrive at by measuring change. And that's indeed what clocks do. All clocks are, or just some way, some device that conveniently standardize is change. Whether that changes swinging of a pendulum. Mark Clark, quartz crystal. So I the the subjective feeling of time, I think I've, I've started with all the way expressed. It's unknown, but the concept of time, I think I, I do like the idea that it's an abstraction that we've created that's incredibly useful to help us understand the universe and make sense of the world, but it's not a fundamental property of physics.

Speaker 4:          00:54:39       Um, thanks for this talk by the way. I had some questions about your thoughts on how are our relative conceptions of time are limited by physical like dendrites, axons, physical barriers. So in a world where we are able to create artificial intelligence or even potentially upload our own consciousness or replicate our consciousness in a world which isn't limited by dendrites and axons, uh Ha have you w what are your thoughts on being able to extend our concepts of time because of those physical barriers being removed for slowing down? So a real person is existing. There's an AI which experiences at thousand years of time because they're able to process information faster.

Speaker 2:          00:55:30       There's, there's a couple of issues there. So those are, those are deep questions. I mean, one is the hardware question, right? Is, is consciousness and our subjective experience of time, hardware dependent hardware limited, can you create ais that have um, consciousness totally equivalent to ours? So that's a question that of course nobody knows the answer to. I mean, as a materialist, I certainly believe there's no reason that consciousness has to be hardware limited. Now that question however, is different from the question of speed of processing, right? So this question of sampling rate, um, in which the speed of processing is ultimately independent of our, the notion of the passage of time, you're processing signals that coming from my speech that you're doing that right now that are far beyond the, your subjective experience, the passage of time. So the brain clearly processes things that are happening very quickly like this.

Speaker 2:          00:56:27       That's microseconds. Your brain detects that. So even though they're made of neurons, it's incredible feat, right? Neurons have a time constant of maybe an action potential. So if you going to give it a computer clock, ray, you'd probably give it a kilo hertz instead of a couple of hundred Gigahertz, for example. So then, um, so that time level of processing is different from the time level of subjective experiences. Now nobody knows the answer to the question of whether an AI would, um, be able to have these temporal distortions of conscious experiences like you or I have. But I think, I think there's, in a way it's the wrong question. I think the mystery is not so much how time comes to be distorted, how are in extreme cases of time, dilation or time compression. But what our normal sense of time is, and I view this is just the flexibility of conscience. Your conscience. You can be time conscious of a short period of time or long term period of time. That's just a conscious state. It's just a flavor of consciousness, just like pain or pleasure or color. So I think that when we understand the nature of consciousness, the question of whether it seems long or short, we'll be sort of a minor issue along those lines. Because I think what we perceive is a bit arbitrary.

Speaker 2:          00:57:49       Just the quick notes where a bit or two pls. Let's not add more questions if you're already in line as your questions.

Speaker 5:          00:57:55       Thank you all here. Um, uh, I want to ask about what is the difference or are they the same thing for the things like a retrospective retrospective thing? He, and so I'll talk about graphic memory or x originals. Back to thinking about a general loss of memory or just some things about myself in the past.

Speaker 2:          00:58:15       Yes, that's a good question. So, um, autobiographical memory or episodic memory is, um, about events in our own knife and that's tightly coupled to how we retrospectively perceived time. So if there's a period of time, whichever rich autobiographical memory I did this, this, this, this, this, and this, that's likely to elicit a long estimate of time. Um, whereas if you don't have any events in memory, um, that's a short period of time. The extreme example of this is somebody who has amnesia. So you can imagine if somebody has no ability to form new episodic memories are autobiographical memories, how could they even estimate the power of time has elapsed? So there's this very touching, poignant case of a British man called Clive wearing, and you've maybe some of you have seen, I'm specials on him, but he has terrible anterograde Amnesia and he believes he seems to be locked into the present. And there's a story where he's writing in his diary, 9:00 AM I just woke up nine 30, now I'm awake for the first time, 10 o'clock now, now I'm really awake for the time. Right. Because if you don't have that memory, how can you know how much time has elapsed so clearly, retrospectively, time and memory are tightly coupled.

Speaker 3:          00:59:31       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:59:32       Um, so as you said, uh, all of our time keeping devices rely on oscillators or rely on some kind of notion of periodicity. And so, um, kind of, I guess my question is like, if you, so if you look at an oscillation or assigned waiver, any sort of, um, you know, any, any sort of phenomenon that you can understand that way, there's a notion of symmetry that's really important that, you know, you could be at one point and, um, and it's also [inaudible] or it can be at the exact same point and then another period later. So it gives you kind of that, that eternal perspective. What if that didn't exist? So, you know, like how would we measure time if we didn't have this sort of repeatable,

Speaker 2:          01:00:10       you mean you mean manmade time, right? Clock time, you mean?

Speaker 4:          01:00:13       Well, I guess what I'm asking is like, is there something fundamental about the idea of like periodicity or no, I never, well, I'm just like, yeah, how was it? It wasn't something that was symmetric that we could always kind of stuff.

Speaker 2:          01:00:26       So, no, I don't think so. I think it sits just reproducibly, I mean, you can measure time by, um, an hourglass is something that's not, doesn't have to be periodic. So I think manmade clocks, um, rely on this mechanism because it's an incredibly useful, symmetric one. Right? And it's the best way to do something continuously. These with periodically something that's periodic, but you need some sophisticated counter. And that was really the main problem. But if you look, even if you look at something like, um, planetary motion, right? You can tell the time of year by looking at the position. Yeah,

Speaker 4:          01:01:02       I've been with an hourglass. You could turn it off. Like there's a kind of, but you don't have to,

Speaker 2:          01:01:05       you can't, you can, but you don't have to write. Um, you could have a non periodic hourglass. So I think, um, periodicity is something that in our minds, because of the success of manmade clocks is something we naturally think of as the ideal way to tell time. And it probably is, but interestingly, and I think there's a downside to that, which is people spent a bit too much time looking for those oscillators, encounters in the brain. And I think that through the field off the bit, because that's probably not how the brain tells time. Yes, brain has oscillators, but it doesn't seem to have many oscillator counter system. So I think these, these metaphors we use in the external world sometimes. Um, can you put us back a bit when we're overly influenced by them? Thank you. Thank you. Thanks everybody for coming and thanks dean. Thanks.

Speaker 3:          01:01:53       Yeah.
