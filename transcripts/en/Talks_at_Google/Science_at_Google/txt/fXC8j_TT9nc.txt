Speaker 1:          00:09          Hello, good morning. Good afternoon and welcome. Welcome. If you're dialing in from somewhere across the world, very excited to have our guests here today and to talk about one of the areas were completely different disciplines are coming together, uh, to make leaps in science and in creativity. So, um, I'm going to introduce our guests and they're gonna share a little bit about some of the stuff we've been doing together and then we're going to try and have a conversation hopefully involving, uh, those of you in the room as well about what's been going on. Um, I'm Matt Britain. If you don't know me, look off to Google business and operations in Europe, Middle East and Africa and wearing a suit. A, that's part of what I have to do. Apologies. Um, I first met, uh, the team at the Natural History Museum in my day job about eight years ago, uh, when I was running our UK business and they were talking about what can we do with our collection in the digital world.

Speaker 1:          00:56          There's probably something there now. It's taken them and us a bit of time to get our stuff together. Uh, but over a 10 month period, the team led by the cultural institutes and uh, say, uh, his who his hair and armpit and team work with about a hundred different teams to people from teams across Google to help to digitize a whole bunch of natural history, uh, not just from the natural history museum, but from 60 different museums. Uh, 300,000 photos, videos and documents from those museums as part of Google Arts and culture. And we're going to have a little bit of a look at some of that later in the natural history museum was a primary partner and our guests today, uh, Eno ins who's here, uh, is, uh, leading the natural history museums work, um, uh, joined them from Imperial College. Uh, he's previously been institute of Zoology in uh, in Queensland final of Queensland in Australia, the Zoological Society of London.

Speaker 1:          01:51          He's a research fellow there. Uh, he sits on the natural environment. Research Council is post genomics and protein. I don't even know where that is. Proteomics. We'll find out about that steering committee. A vice president of the council, the British trust for ornithology atrocity, the national biodiversity, a network, and you oversee the work of 300 different scientists and a huge, a collection of 70 million different specimens. And we might talk a bit about that as well as write your CV so long that I won't go through it. You don't mind. Um, there are lots of other things I don't understand on it as well. And then Vince who's here, uh, started as an evolutionary biologist and is really leading the application of digital technologies to the study and taxonomy of biodiversity and he's head of informatics at the Natural History Museum. That's probably not a role that was around when it was founded back in the day. So we might talk about that as well. But first can I invite Ian to just share a little bit about the work that you've been doing and then we'll have a chat.

Speaker 2:          02:49          Sure. So I don't want this to turn into a lecture. I was in universities for 20 years, so I was warning Matt. I am prone to that. Um, but hopefully you've all, you all know about the natural history museum. One of the pleasures of working here, you show this sort of image, you say where you're from. It's got a big brand globally, about 5 million people come here, here physically about the same number of visitor exhibitions around the world and about double that visitors digitally at the moment. So it's got a big brand. Now this place was founded. Why? It's based on a collection from that was started in the 16 hundreds. It started as the British Museum. So it was very much a product of the age of reason. Um, people coming out of a period when the mythology and religion with the dominant and ways of understanding the world, these sorts of institutions were really created to start to um, talk about the world rationally and explain it.

Speaker 2:          03:40          Cause one of the key parts of that was to find objects around the world, bring them to a big hub, actually show them to sue people. So we've got a few slides here we can dip in and out of these arm, go through a few of them. This is what if you think about the big hall at the Front of the Natural History Museum, this is what's on the ceiling is absolutely beautiful. This actually tells a quite an important point about our founding. This is a whole series of plants which are of industrial or medical importance. So these sorts of institutions were founded partly out of raw curiosity for the natural world. And particularly with the history of the natural world. They were all there were always intended also to be a tool for exploration in terms of innovation as well. So things like cocoa plants, coffee, potatoes and so on.

Speaker 2:          04:25          They all came through these sorts of institutions. The other thing, of course, these institutions contain some unbelievably cool objects that have really changed the way that individuals have, have, have affected how we all think about the world here. So on the left here and once, some of my favorite specimens, those, uh, those aren't just what we always joke there was that aren't just any Darwin's finches. There was a Darwin's Darwin's finches. So these are the sorts of objects that really started making us think about, um, evolution and natural selection. That Brown object at the top, that is the first bit of dinosaur that somebody dug up and figured out what it was. There was a really nice story about, they realize, my goodness, it's a lizard, but it's the lizard that's about 30 meters long. So that's the first dinosaur bottom there. That's the first non human human that we dug up from Gibraltar.

Speaker 2:          05:14          When people started figuring out there were other humans around at some stage. And if you think about what that meant back in that time, we were the only human, the world that only been around a few thousand years of power to suddenly say unambiguously and to show there were other humans around. That was a rev, intellectually revolutionary moment. Um, I know over here, Vince will probably talk about this. This is, um, this is, we have the thing that it says, one of them got up, um, the Galapagos mockingbirds actually it's these specimens rather than the finches that Darwin actually started thinking about evolution. He actually collected these things. And the next day in his notebook when he wasn't being sick, I'm in the Beagle, he started to write a little what we would now call trees of life and say, I think things change. So when you put these in front of people, as we do both physically and now through the institute, you can always captivate people first of all about the object and then about the people.

Speaker 2:          06:06          But then it's the big idea. And of course what we're interested in at the moment is it's no longer necessary to bring people to that institution in South Kensington. We want this to be available to anybody anytime, anywhere. And that's all about digital and genomic technologies. You want me to just keep going for a minute? I or maybe a couple of these here are some of the sorts of specimens. Are there sort of data that we work with? Huge collections of insects, 27 million, um, pin insects. It's Pr. I always check with Vince. It's probably the most analog thing that I know. Who in the world, if you want to get the, these, these, um, insects have been incredibly important in demonstrating, um, climate change. If you want to know what some one of those labels and the data behind that you have to go to that object will lift up the specimen and write it out yourself.

Speaker 2:          06:58          It's an amazingly analog system. It's been like that for let's say 250 years. Our job is to destroy that intellectual model and to make that information freely available. I could see, you know, you, you've barcoded them now. Yeah. So this is, we've, we've um, had a project where we've bark out, we've now digitized, um, the UK lepidoptera collections, that's butterflies and moths, two words. That's about 800,000 specimens. Um, it was a demonstration project to say, to show that this can be done and these are the sorts of pipelines that you need to set up, um, to do it. So yes, that database is on the best place to get to that database, to that data at the moment would be through the Google Cultural Institute. 300,000 of them are on there. So we've started, um, digitizing some of our collections. This also shows, so for example, with the recent Ebola outbreaks, one of the first things you need to figure out for something like Ebola is where did it come from?

Speaker 2:          07:52          Almost everything that will really kill humans on a large scale is leaping across the humans from something else, relatively recently, Ebola, as an example of that. So when you try and figure out where that comes from, you, you realize it's from the fruit bats that live in that area. And you go back into the collection and say, how long is a bowl of being in these fruit bats? You can use genetic techniques to extract that. So sometimes it's unexpected. It's not always systematic digitization, sometimes other things like that. Um, uh, drew might, um, drew pervs is hair from the mindset and Andrew probably recognizes this year, a collaborator collaborator in this project, aren't you? This is a big project called them predicts. This is trying to mobilize the sort of data we've just been looking at to first of all, map biodiversity in the world. Now then figure out, um, what our impact, what humanities impact has been on that by diversity and then predict the future.

Speaker 2:          08:46          So that's something that we're really interested in because we want to give people hope about the future as well as making them realize that there's some big decisions to be made and that sort of analysis that these guys have been doing, um, demonstrate that the decisions we in right now could I have a really big impact, not just over the next hundred years, for the next 50 years, but they are very data intensive compared to the sorts of studies that people used to do before on here. Um, we calculated the other day, there's the prevalence of about 65 million individual animals labeled on this map. So that's, and that's the sort of data that you need in the natural history collections around the world. There's probably between about one and a half and 3 billion data points just from the specimens. That's not even going into the literature.

Speaker 2:          09:32          Okay. I'll probably stop on this slide. This is where the challenges start. So what we can do at the moment, we feel that we know roughly what we want to do and we have some pipelines set up for doing that, be they physical or infomatic. It's really scaling that up. So at the moment we're doing a few hundred thousand specimens. I think on the Google Cultural Institute today, there's about 300,000 specimens. That's a lot compared to what museums have done before, but if we're trying to get into the millions and the high millions, you need to really scale that. Then that really becomes an informatic issue. This is a great example of this. This is about as bad as the collections get in terms of hard to change anything from analog into digital. Here's a typical curator. This is Max Barclay in charge of our beetle collection. Fascinating stories, sort of his collection laid out in front of him.

Speaker 2:          10:21          If you actually go and look at one of those objects, they're quite often like that. So you can see in this case, a fly at the top there and then he can see that set of labels underneath it. That's the metadata in many cases were much more interested in that data than we are to be honest in the fly. We'd like a leg off the flight, get the genome from it, then we want the data. Maybe you can see at the moment what we do is we tend to one, pick those labels, photograph them and then start extracting information off that. That's okay for a few tens of thousands, for a few millions, you need to, you need to break that. Similarly, you can see the way that the different labels or um, uh, typed out or written there. You can see that, um, how are you going to do that?

Speaker 2:          11:02          You're really going to transcribe that by hand. So at the moment we sometimes use a curator to an expert if you like to transcribe that. But typically we want to apply OCR first. We want to cut that image up, put it back together. Um, use OCR to figure out what sort of like a labels. Um, so we've got some image recognition software to look at what's a return label and what's a handwritten label. Then we want to use OCR on the written or typed labels. Then we started to go down into their handwritten labels. We crowdsource some of that really fun crowd sourcing, but at the moment we can digitize things about 10 times as fast as we can crowdsource them. So we need to only be serving things to real humans that need a real human's mind. We need to do everything we can without that human mind before that last result if you're like, so that fascinating. I think all of us can understand the parallels between

Speaker 1:          11:54          the sort of tagging taxonomy, a structured sets and the ingestion of large amounts of data. And we'll talk a bit more about some of that. Maybe let's just end by looking at one of the ways in which the teams work with you to try to make this stuff more accessible. Uh, I think we've got a little video of the Romaleos. Saurus can we, can we go and have a quick look at that? Cause I think the other part of what we're trying to do is obviously increased people's interest in accessibility to this. So let's have a look at this. Many of you have seen some of this, but to have a look if you haven't at the arts and Culture App and these connections that are really a sensation on, and it's a sense that we're just starting the journey of what's possible. I would still ask you events, uh, about your personal journey because as an evolutionary biologist to become the head of the informatics division, how did that start? Yeah, that's a bit of a loose about the journeys. I mean,

Speaker 3:          13:39          started perhaps like I guess like many phd students in, in, in the UK with an interest in the natural world. And I wanted to find the, an interesting project to work on. And the group that I chose to work on, um, was a rather obscure in group called parasitic lights. So we're familiar with them as the parasites that live in our, uh, sometimes live in our school, children's hair, and a very difficult to get rid of. But they're really fascinating group because they've coevolve with the hosts over millions and millions of years. And when I started to work on them, there was very little known about them. So I started a database. I started, um, very crude and rudimentary digital techniques to try and build that, that put that data together. It was also at a time when the web was almost just being born is about 2000. So about 1997 to 2000. I did my phd. And, um, the web was just being explored as a scientific tool and increasingly we needed to build databases to share that information, to make it accessible, to make it curator bubble. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          14:43          All right. So this is actually at the time when the web was being used in the way that it was designed by, you know, affected by Tim in terms of research.

Speaker 3:          14:49          Exactly. And, um, I started to, because there were no easy to use tools that are out there, I really have to build those systems myself. So very simple system sharing information about specimens, images, molecular data, and trying to do that in a way that would bring in many of my colleagues. Because, as you can imagine, there aren't many Laos authorities around the, uh, in the UK. They tend to be very widely scattered. I needed to communicate with them and I needed to be able to bring their expertise to this database. And then over time, of course I realize that the, the rather parochial little problem that I had in trying to understand the evolution of this group was a PA in parallel really to everybody, other, all the other authorities working on other taxonomic groups. And so we started instead of building systems just to study parasitic lice, we started to build platforms, platforms that would work for other taxonomic groups.

Speaker 3:          15:46          And that was when I started to get very seriously interested in digital. And was there a moment where you could see the potential of this technology? I mean obviously you started because you were just doing your own cataloging and then you start to connect with others. Was there a moment where you started to go, oh, I can see how big this? I think, um, probably that moment was when I started to collaborate on a, a global project called the tree of life to actually share that information on what was at the time. It still exists actually a pretty rudimentary website where we are trying to share data about the evolutionary history of taxonomic groups. And a, an uh, an evolutionary biologist in the u s had built this platform that was critical to building those evolutionary crease and allowed us to share that data. And then I started to collaborate on that project.

Speaker 3:          16:32          That was probably the epiphany moment when I started to realize there's really something in this for many other taxa in terms of how we do this at a global level. But it all started with light. It all started with this very curious group of about 5,000 species of parasites on about 5,000 species of mammal, about 10,000 species of bird and about 12,000 associations between those and as, as a student basically trying to manage all of that data, trying to extract that from the scientific literature, that's an enormous task. You break it up into small enough chunks and you distribute the problem and actually it becomes a tractable problem. Fantastic. And they'll tell us a bit more about where you are today and the focus that you have today with a digital portal, with all the specimens that you're in, the process of digitizing. So I think there's two big challenges now.

Speaker 3:          17:22          So I lead the informatics group within the museum and I think we have two big challenges, one of which and alluded to and it's beautifully illustrated there, just the sheer scale of the collection, the enormity of this physical collection and trying to digitize that, that insect that you see, that pinned insect, that fly there is a good example of digitizing that through traditional methods. Takes about two minutes and 20 seconds to take all of those labels off, to take a photograph to get a rudimentary transcription. And what we really want to do is speed that process up. So robotics, I can potentially help using, um, uh, tools are able to allow us to digitally reconstruct the label without physically having to take them off. Unfortunately, some of those labels are folded. So alas, we can't,

Speaker 1:          18:11          yeah, anybody here work on the books project? So the early days of our book scanning project was basically Larry and Sergei arguing about how quickly you could digitize a book and and using a photocopier to sort of figure out the mechanics of doing it was very much the same kind of problem here.

Speaker 3:          18:25          It's very, it's a very rudimentary problem in some ways, but I think things like computer vision for example, a critical to then helping stitch some of those images together. So we can use a rig where we can take a number of oblique images of that specimen, automatically stitch it together, run OCR, run handwriting recognition across that and that Paul of material that then fails those tests we then put through to our crowd sourcing so that then humans can start intervening and getting that data.

Speaker 1:          18:54          The first key challenge is the large scale digitization of those artifacts in and species specimens and so on.

Speaker 3:          19:01          Yeah. And what else did it, so the next big challenge I think is how do we exploit that data? How do we meaningfully get data from particularly that imagery? So there is a, um, a huge opportunity I think in terms of computer vision, in terms of trying to recognize in an automated way what those objects are and then apply that across all sorts of science across, across the globe. So of course we have the authoritative collection of all of the, uh, roughly 2 million species that have been described so far and we can potentially get imagery for sometimes 10, sometimes hundreds of thousands of those specimens. So being able then to use that imagery to facilitate things like automatic species recognition so that imagine someone, um, uh, a member of the public perhaps innocently taking a photograph out on the Serengeti or we're basically wherever they are and being able to automatically recognize what's in that image and exploit that. That has a huge transformative potential in terms of helping us to understand the natural world. What's there when it was

Speaker 1:          20:09          pick some of us were thinking about when you were showing, uh, when we're showing the Lepidoptera and thinking, well, how far away are we from just being able to use a camera to identify how far away are we? Does it vary by species or,

Speaker 3:          20:19          so it really varies by tag to something. There's some tax, uh, some groups lend themselves to that. So, uh, butterflies and moths in particular Lepidoptera because they're quite two dimensional and many of the key characteristics you can see in, um, uh, in that image you can actually get species recognition. Certainly recognition to some of the lower taxes for other groups, it's much, much harder. There's much more three dimensionality to them. The discriminating features a tucked away, a hidden away getting it that information is harder, but that's the potential. Right. And, and if we step from what you're doing to Ian's role, which is as director of science, what are the things that most excite you and that the big challenges that you're focusing on

Speaker 2:          21:01          in this area? There's also the public aspects of this. So we all, you know, when you look at that museum to begin with this, we are a scientific institution, but we also want to get the broad public interested in these sorts of things. And there's a selfish reason for that because if we think that if you want to make politicians and so on, bold enough to make good decisions for the long term environment, you need to get the public interested in that. And lots of events show there's a long way to go with that. So things like the Rumelia short source, we were just looking at there, that's an amazing way of literally bringing an iconic specimen to life. So that specimen is in the, is one of our main halls. It was collected right at the beginning of this discovery period by a woman called Mary Anning.

Speaker 2:          21:41          So great story behind it. But by using that bit of Vr to bring it to to life, to give that to schools and well it lets you tell some really interesting stories and if you watched the video, I showed him how to goodness knows how many people have all sorts of ages that totally captivated to begin with. They liked the buzz of what they put on the cardboard. They like that. Then they see the Vr, they like that. That's still sufficiently need to intro to interest them. The creature comes towards them, almost everybody kind of Ah, you no bit scared by it. But then afterwards, as a narrative about the natural world and about the oceans, that's afterwards, that's what they want to ask you about. So it's really, really interesting and he couldn't do a better thing with a specimen. Then that series of events and the cool thing about that, of course it's, well we do that all the time with people that are lucky enough to be standing, talking to us in South Kensington. But if you want to change society's, mine's about things. It has to, it has to be more than that. And that's what that really does mean.

Speaker 3:          22:37          So you, you are organizing the natural world's information and making it accessible and useful to everyone, which actually ring true to us as well. Yeah. Um, and do you worry about I need to get people to the museum versus if I digitize things they won't come or what's your experience been of that affects the opposite. So the moment that you start to digitize things and we see this for example, with our loan, so we are in one sense, we are a rather curious museum. Many museums are about preserving and holding on to things were busy sending tens of thousands of specimens out on academic loans every year. And actually the experience is when you digitize those and you make digitalized copies of those available, you actually get more loan requests, more engagement, not less. So I think quite the opposite actually. I think digital brings many more people physically in to uh, engage with our collections.

Speaker 3:          23:30          One of the interesting things in music, we see that an explosion in people going to see music live as well as having every recorded song in history and they're in their pocket. So it seems that one drives the other. And what are the other challenges that you face in terms of the public engagement? I guess I don't to mention any of the political events of this week, but, uh, you know, we're in a world where things may go backwards rather than forwards in some of these agendas. What's the, what's the best way for you to connect with the policy makers and get ongoing support? Cause this stuff costs, it was started by the amateurs and that's why the by the filthy rich, but, but now this is a real cost to it. And how do you deal with the policy making challenge in the funding challenge it.

Speaker 2:          24:06          So that's, um, that's a good question about, um, the, um, the challenge with respect to the public and the policy makers is, as I said when I started, this is not to feel as though you're lecturing them. If they come into the museum or they come onto our different sorts of products and they feel that they know this is going to be a lecture about giving more aid with respect to diseases or climate change or habitat, um, usage and saw, they veer away from that. So as with lots of different media advertising for example, you've got to get a smart way into their head, get the hook into their head and then start to talk and almost they're interested. Talk to them about the bigger piece. So you can see that the sorts of objects we were just talking about that they're fascinating. Um, they've got some interesting scientific points about them, but there are way into people's heads and that's the way we often use it in terms of funding and so on.

Speaker 2:          24:55          What we see and the way of funding these sorts of missions is a combination of government support and then getting different sorts of entrepreneurial support. So if you look around the world, that institutions that have done most digitalization typically so far, they've usually been doing that based on substantial government support. I'd say the limitation of that is that doesn't necessarily make you very innovative. You get 10 million bucks to do your botanical collection. So you do that and then you stop doing it. What we want to create is a set of platforms that anybody can do it anywhere and it's much cheaper and so on to do that. So I see that sweet spot as the government support plus different sorts of entrepreneurial ventures as well.

Speaker 3:          25:40          Yeah, I was just going to him and I think one, the, the one cap on top of that also isn't really great science, which demonstrates why this data is so important. And that slide that we had just earlier the, the work actually that drew was involved in demonstrating that we have lost significant fractions of biodiversity and that if we continue along that path, we will lose a, at an increasing rate. That biodiversity is a great illustration. Was going to ask you a bit more about that exactly at this point actually. So, uh, tell us more about how you're using the data. You have the historic data to extrapolate the future trends and to highlight these issues. What are the challenges there? What's it showing it? So that project used, um, a mixture of basically data mining but very human intensive, rather laborious, actually data mining.

Speaker 3:          26:25          So an army has students rated lots of scientific literature that was basically showing changing patterns of the biodiversity before and after land use change. And by knowing what was there and by knowing what was there now and being able to classify those different habitats, we can start to then see where there's been the most biodiversity loss. And we can also start to model how a future things like climate change scenarios for example, are going to impact that loss. Because the good news and there is some good news from this, is that some of those climate change scenarios can mitigate that rate of loss and we can actually start to repair some of the damage that we've been doing. So tell us a bit more about what's shown here and about the work that you're doing it with a machine learning expert.

Speaker 2:          27:14          Do you want to talk about it all in on it? So this is a, um, this is, uh, this is just the trust real world at the moment. Uh, but this is showing the percentage of original um, flora and fauna that are still there. So, um, if you, um, I think that's the way around if it is yes. So if you've got a blue number, that means that a large proportion of bloop color that's um, a large proportion of the species are still intact. Um, as it gets redder, it means that an increasingly large proportion of being lost and there's all sorts of different ways you can add those numbers up. Obviously the main conclusions to this, a pretty robust to those sorts of differences in exactly which species you glue. Now what you can see is the global average is that we've lost about 13% or so of species.

Speaker 2:          28:00          What you can also see is that it's incredibly heterogeneously distributed. There are some areas, often whether it's relatively low species that are relatively intact, there are also places such as the Amazon basin there that you can see that are intact. You can see there are some other areas that are an incredibly disturbed. Now at the moment, one of the interesting things, stroke, terrifying things is we don't actually know what the function looks like between this type of species count and ecological functioning. Now these guys have also been doing some work on another index called, um, whether trying to actually estimate the effects of this on ecosystems that's an unexplored, well, it's very exciting, but a relatively unexplored area. So we don't know whether there are people called tipping points in this system or whatever. There are linear relationships and so on. One of the other cool things about natural history collections is they are literally a time machine.

Speaker 2:          28:51          So they're one of the, one of very few on and ambiguous ways that you can go back a few hundred years. And Matt, what's been happening and those few hundred years that we've been around collecting things or our ancestors had been around collecting things, of course was exactly the moment when Western civilization started going around the world and driving a lot of this. So it's a, I suppose it's a fortunate accident. At the same time we started exploiting the world and doing this to it. We were collecting through that period. So it's a time machine. The, the, um, the challenge now is to open that up now we've done some of that analytically so we can push some of these graphs back to about 1500 using some generalizations about the way the world works with respect to the sort of habitats that are there. But these collections offered the opportunity to be much more specific than that as well.

Speaker 1:          29:42          Well, um, can, can you say a little bit about how you've collaborated with the deep mind team or with, with the Google teams. What's that been like? How easy was it to just, Oh, it was obvious we need to do this and how much was it trying to figure out a way of working?

Speaker 2:          29:56          So come on, be honest. We ask now. Well, it's, it's, there are good things to say, so it's easy to be honest. When we first started talking to each other, um, yes, there's that classic cultural difference about, you know, what's important and so on. I found that, well I found that a mixture of incredibly rewarding and very, very challenging. So sometimes I'll talk to a couple of your guys, um, and they will start to ask me, so why do you, why do you bring botanical specimens back to the museum? So doing it for 200 years, young man, that's the way we do it. But once you go through the whole flow of why you're doing it, the information that you can see, we could capture all of that in the field. Now you realize the only reason to actually bring the specimen back is just as a voucher for all of that information.

Speaker 2:          30:40          So sometimes it completely changes how you think. And to be honest, for an institution that's 200 years old, that's one of the big things you've got to be doing. You've got to be challenging yourself on very fun. You know, why collect and if you're going to collect tomorrow, why the hell are you going to collect the same way as he did 200 years ago? You should throw that out and completely rethink it. The second layer for you is, yeah, you guys work quickly in a very, very nimble way. So we like to plan projects going on, plenty of paperwork there, maybe plan it again and that sort of thing. And you know, we'll do that over a couple of years. Um, where you guys are kind of say, so I remember when we were doing the Romaleos saurus there, let's do it. Let's do a Vr of this.

Speaker 2:          31:20          Oh, okay. That's that kind of us, you know, that's a good idea. This is what it would involve. Caitlin. And we were thinking six months a year, let's do it by the end of the week. Now for us, that's an unbelievably challenging timescale, but it's been a good, isn't it? Yeah, absolutely. I mean, I think that agility was what I was going to pick up on. I think, again, really in science, particularly digital science, we used to having to work quite quickly. So in one sense that wasn't such a problem. But working with some of the other bits of the museum which are may be not quite so comfortable with that. Um, uh, that, that degree of speed of working. I remember with the tank room, it was quite literally the decision was made the night before to do the filming. So being able to turn the museum around to secure the permissions necessary to do that filming and literally to be in there the following morning, that is quite a challenge.

Speaker 2:          32:10          We showed it to her, this amazing room that you go into, which has got historical samples all around. Absolutely wonderful. The wonderful curator that knows every specimen. There's the original sealer camp and things in there. We show this to say, I think I was about five o'clock by the time we got all, he was telling us stories and we said, why don't we put this on the cultural institutes? So what he says, if you've got an objection, no objection, but how are we going to do that? Because if I can get the right team here, I guess eight o'clock the next morning, can we film

Speaker 1:          32:40          this and do the videos and do the three d modeling. So if you can get your team here by eight o'clock we'll be here. Yeah. And we did it the next morning and now we've been trying to do that center since I've been at the museum. So to be able to accelerate things at that pace of the half, that attitude and those resources to be able to really have that team the next morning knocking on the door. And they were incredible. And I was, I was actually just watching that. It's a three 60 video. And is it, is it only the, the, the curator of all things fish and it's brilliant because it's extremely accessible. He's a natural. He's, he should be on television and now he, and now he is. So that's part of making it accessible and uh, any difficulties, I mean there's obviously there's a pace thing, there's a bit of an agility thing.

Speaker 1:          33:21          You mentioned any difficulties where we were just at cross purposes or, or the agenda that our teams had was, was just at odds with what was going to drive your work forward? I don't think they are, I don't think there are major differences like that. I think it, that challenge eventually is prioritization. So whenever we're in a room together, we can come up with 20 cool ideas and then it's the case that was 20 it was a short meeting and then it's a case of figuring out, okay, which ones are we going to work on? Work on next. Really. So that's what, this is an exciting challenge. So I want to come to the audience and that get any questions or suggestions or thoughts you have. So just raise your hand and it has a mic if you want to do any of that while you're having a think about really smart questions. Uh, just kind of coming back to you and the work that you're doing, what, what do you see as being the biggest areas of potential next? You've talked a bit about the kind of near term challenges, but where do you think this could go? So I mean I think, I think

Speaker 3:          34:15          ultimately the really grand challenge is not what we've talked about here is obviously relevant to the natural history museum, but there are literally hundreds, thousands of natural history museums all around the globe that have entirely the same problem. Ian Talk Right at the beginning about that figure of roughly 1.5 to 3 billion specimens in natural history collections. So how do we take our problem that we have at the natural history museum and build solutions that work for all of those institutions to try and extract that data? Because for me, the really grand vision, if you like, as to what we're going to do with all of that data is to try to model the natural world. So by that I mean take literally every facet of information that we've possibly got. Everything about the taxonomy, the evolutionary history, the traits of the phenotypic traits, the morphological traits of the specimen, the genotypic information, all of the a biotic information as well, and start to model that.

Speaker 3:          35:14          So that we have a very precise understanding of what the natural world is, what's happening to it and how can we mitigate the rest about that to the natural world. That is probably the ultimate and most inclusive grand challenge because it basically encompasses or the scientists involved in the study of the natural world, all the institutions, all the collections, and also the tremendous body of literature that we've already generated on this. In a curious way, our science is a little bit unusual to a number of other science sciences in the loss of the documentation about the natural world, even if it was written 300 years ago is still highly relevant today. And then you can't say that about physics or astronomy, but you can say that about our science. So we have 300 million pages of text, pretty much that have been, that represent the corpus of knowledge that had been written so far about the natural world.

Speaker 3:          36:11          We have a big program to digitize that. We've done about 50 million of those pages so far. Um, but trying to then extract meaning, semantic meaning from that is also a huge opportunity. But that grand vision is to really bring it all together in an integrative way so that we have effectively at all for the whole of the scientific communities. That's striking when you talk, I mean I think we see this in many areas that were in different disciplines come together. That's when creativity in innovation really happens. You talk in a way that I'm not see biologists talk about platforms and data and applying that to problems or others in your field starting to do the same thing. Or are you a as the British navy world? I think? Well I think the beginning too, but the challenge also is partly there one of resources. So it's relatively easy for someone to innovate digitally and to do something in a very sort of project oriented way.

Speaker 3:          37:04          It usually takes, depending upon the nature of that, the initiative may be five or 10 times the amount of revolt resource to actually build a robust platform that will then work and scale in a sensible way. So I think in terms of leadership, yes we probably are leading the way in some of those, um, development of some of those platforms. But I think it's partly also we're often trying to serve many different audiences. We have to build projects. Often it's more project oriented than program or um, platform oriented and trying to bridge that gap between if you like the project and the program. That's the hard bit, that scaling bit something that Google of course have done so well. I'm just thinking of if be talking to another when my colleagues questions, thoughts, suggestions for the guests. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          37:53          Yeah. So you were talking about the loss of biodiversity. Um, I assume there are people who say, why should I care that there are only 84 flies where they used to be 100 flies. Um, so what did you reply to those people?

Speaker 3:          38:08          That's very hard one to answer actually. I remember, uh, I remember that same query being made on a radio four program to a very eminent scientist actually a few years ago. And he actually, well he was rather colorful in his language in terms of how he replied because the truthful answer is we often don't know. You could imagine each of these species as being like a book full of pages that we've yet to read. Now we don't know what the value is necessarily

Speaker 2:          38:36          in preserving or keeping all of those species. We can talk in a cultural and a social sense about general, um, value of biodiversity. But the specifics of that particular fly is very hard to pin down. All I can say is if you imagine each of those species was like a library, you would not burn the library just because you hadn't read it. You'd probably at least read it first. That's one ounce. I don't know whether you've got a better one. No, that's um, well the, the other answer we use is we often go into, uh, if, if it's somebody who wants an answer from a very human perspective than what we often use is the concept of ecosystem services. So we know that at some stage if you carry on doing this, eventually you are going to screw up to an enormous degree because almost everything, if you ask, you know what you ate this morning, what you're dressed in, everybody here, I would imagine this, you haven't had anything to eat yet.

Speaker 2:          39:27          Well I've had some plants to eat this um, this morning beat through bread or through cereals or temperament that might be you'll be dressed in things that come from plants and so on. Now at the moment those systems, um, we can, we can still harvest those systems. The water that you get will have come through some sort of natural system is what almost all the resources that you ultimately rely on, including the resources that are in technical devices. And so they're coming from natural systems and now at the moment we are, we are just staring that bucket. If you're, I could a fairly vigorous rate and so far we can see things going wrong but we can still harvest it. We don't yet know how long we can keep doing that. We can use this map of course to demonstrate between different sites sites was good.

Speaker 2:          40:11          Intactness and science with pouring tactless with respect to species demonstrate ecosystem services really start to deteriorate. And so that's the kind of more strategic and sort of feel like that if everything that we depend on is ultimately a natural system on this planet, um, and we need to, we need to keep that intact for humanity. And there are thumb systems that are exceedingly vulnerable at the moment. The coral reefs would be a great example of that. We're about to hit a tipping point due to, um, a rising sea temperature in ocean acidification, which probably means that by about 20, 50, virtually every single coral reef will have very significant damage and some will just simply be wiped out because their tolerance to that environmental change is just simply too narrow. They can't cope. So many of those or all the services that are dependent from tourism, from fishing, from the ornamental fish trade, uh, through, uh, to, um, uh, yeah, there's a, a world of economic loss that will also happen when we lose those coral reefs.

Speaker 2:          41:17          I guess this kind of modeling will allow us to understand things like if we don't honor the Paris climate agreement for example, what kind of implications there could be. You extrapolate exactly. One of the really interesting when you asked before matter about effectively how to influence policy makers. I don't know why it's on my mind. I'm sorry I'm putting aside some um, challenging examples. Another error. I think that we need to get smarter in this as well as getting a kind of the suitable hook into their mind. We also need to give them solutions as well as problems and some of the work that comes out of this project has really interesting in that respect and that you've probably all familiar with the, with the hawks called the hockey stick curves for climate change. So it goes them from relatively cool in the path and it goes up at an alarming rate with why it's called the hockey stick curve and at the right hand side that it's got different scenarios.

Speaker 2:          42:09          It's usually got four to six different scenarios. As a biologist, I look at that with real MB because that little guy, you're really modeling the physical world there. You know you've got a bit of climate that you got a bit of historical climate data in thirds and climate data and so on. Now what the team behind this that is that taking that challenges that we should be able to model the biological world in the same way we should know what's happened in the past. We should be able to calculate what's happening now and most importantly predict what's happening in the future based on exactly the same scenarios that they're using for climate change and so on, which are usually based on things like how many people there are, what you're doing with respect to reforestation and carbon storage and what you're doing with respect to burning fossil fuels and songs and that's what that team have done so you can now show us similar biodiversity curve, which from 1500 it goes along.

Speaker 2:          42:59          It comes down in a really alarming fashion as we spread our agricultural around the world, which also drives this pattern here. Then the different curves at the end there that predict what would happen under different future worlds. They are really different. Some of them just continue to go down. So you're heading, I would say you're heading there towards an ecosystem crisis. You're going to get major services collapsing, but even under some of the models that are being that are being used now, some of them are curving up within 50 years and one of the main drivers for that is about how we reforest and how we look after carbon and so on. So there you can say to policymakers instead of saying it's all a disaster, you're going to have to spend a lot of money, but it's probably not during your term, not very attractive.

Speaker 2:          43:44          You can say you guys can save the world. Look at this. If you reforest it in this way and drove your fuel policies in this way, within 50 years people are going to be having a, people are going to be feeling the difference on a global scale. We haven't really been able to do that before because suddenly it becomes a doable challenge and 50 years, okay. It's outside the normal elections and election cycle. Sure. Um, but I think 50 years is the sort of time period that people realize that that's either me or my kids. It's certainly my grandkids. So it's a tangible period that you can make a difference and it's, um, and it's very visually compelling when you do that. So I think that's one of our challenges to present. So to find solutions and present them in a way that policy makers can work with them. Wow. Great. And we've got there from flies.

Speaker 1:          44:32          Other questions? Here we go. Um, so on that graph, how come? Europe doesn't seem to be as devastated as like Australia or America.

Speaker 2:          44:43          Okay. So, um, can you guess why Australia is bright red, particularly the central of Australia there.

Speaker 5:          44:51          Okay.

Speaker 2:          44:51          Ozone Layer. Sorry. Um, so, so why was that and why climate change? One of the affects of sheep, sheep and rabbits have had an enormous effect on the species that would live in Australia. So a few introduced species buyers had devastated the bio, the bio terrain of the middle of Australia. Um, so sometimes you get massive effects like that. Um, you can see often it's associated with that. The best, the best way usually of destroying biodiversity is to suddenly to have an area that's quite bad by diverse, rich and suddenly tried to increase the gross domestic product of that area because then you basically just have to take every resource out of that. Well, places like Europe, we're not an enormously diverse area. We are, we have relatively protected landscapes compared to some, so we still have some of our biodiversity and left. Um, if you look across North America, you can see where that big belt is through the middleware. Anybody had the pleasure of driving across the central of America. You can see what's kind of been going on there. There's mass industrial size, um, agriculture, very difficult for by domestic to cope with.

Speaker 1:          45:59          And it's thinks like the advances in artificial nitrogen fixing and productivity. You, you alluded to that there, but it just tell us it has a bit more about how those kinds of practices have affected this as far as you understand.

Speaker 2:          46:10          Okay. So I mean, what's going to affect this in the future? Um, a lot of this is to do with, um, it's a couple of big effects. It's how many people you have around, um, how will you control the climate and how you manage those habitats. They're clearly that, you know, from an environmental perspective, the ideal thing is to have a relatively low number of people, um, to control the environment and then to manage those habitats in a way that is relatively sustainable and it's achieving the balance across those things. I mean, I don't think any of us are saying we don't want to harvest new materials. If you look through, for example, South America, there you can, one of the challenges with the changes in Colombia, for example, absolutely amazing biodiversity in Colombia. One of the reasons it probably exists in some areas is it would be far too dangerous to go in there.

Speaker 2:          46:59          You know, I've discussed with them in the past thing. How about we explore there and how about we, it's going to say you do not want to go through that valley with your binoculars and you'll, you know little, you're welcome. Yeah. So in those sorts of, there's also amazing minerals in Colombia which will power the technologies that a lot of us are dependent upon. That's where the new batteries and then new screens and so on are going to come from and those sorts of things. And our challenge is to try to be able to extract those minerals in a sustainable way but keep the bone adversity as intact as possible. That's really challenging, but it's very conspicuous that already, since those deals are starting to happen in Colombia, they are over here talking to us about exactly how to do that. So you're talking about major areas of South America where you can make a difference about how biodiversity is going to go there in the next 10 years or so.

Speaker 2:          47:49          Really excited, but they need data to, it's good. It's going to be a data driven solution that thereafter. Other questions? Hi, it's my wife is a zoological research fellow and uh, at the various universities she's gone to the state of the art for recording data tends to be an excel spreadsheet at the top end. Um, reducing down to, she does bird rain, bird ringing and bartering is often just recorded on scraps of paper which are mailed it to each other. Um, what can we do and what can you do to help improve the, uh, the recording and the sharing of high quality data from the academic community?

Speaker 3:          48:30          So I think, I mean I'll try and answer that one. I think fundamentally it's platforms is building platforms that support the acquisition of that data. The fact that it needs to be done offline because many of the places where people are doing that recording, they don't have digital connectivity. The synchronization and integration of that data is a big challenge. Um, so yeah, I, I, I feel your pain to some degree because I've been involved in that community for quite some time. Um, often there are communities of practice that are quite as difficult to change. There's a cultural problem there as well in terms of trying to shift people away from bits of paper to recording things natively. Uh, digitally. There's also issues about devices when you bring devices, particularly into some parts of the field, you know that they're going to get wet is extremely hot.

Speaker 3:          49:17          It's humid a or sometimes it's freezing cold. Um, the issue about connectivity is there's also critical is we've had to in some cases build really big temporary wifi networks. We do some work in Lyme, Regis and just on the beach. There is no good connectivity. So you need to put in basic infrastructure like a wifi network just to be able to get citizens to help recording and documenting, um, uh, what's on the beach. So I think Google, uh, organizations like ourselves, other natural history based organizations in the UK, uh, have a key role in trying to, um, uh, build those systems, those platforms to try and deliver that transition toward digital. But it's, it's a, it's a challenge partly because it's a cultural thing. It's not really a technology thing.

Speaker 2:          50:07          Another question here, I think. Yeah, thanks. Um, so we were talking about environmental policy before and I guess one of the biggest challenges is that it only really works is if all the countries around the word work together and pull in the same direction. And I guess is this something you're trying do by making

Speaker 3:          50:28          your collection available online or how can we use that to convince people around the word? So, uh, there is a very strong link between all those natural history collections worldwide. It tends to start, it tends to be kind of at the continental level, predominantly the conversations. So for example, I sit on an organization called [inaudible], the consortium of European taxonomic facilities, which represents the 50 major natural history collections across about 20 countries in Europe. And we talk constantly about basically how we can share technologies. We can develop a common agenda, uh, to, um, uh, to, to, to basically provide the data, the platforms or systems to make this kind of science possible. So I would say at that level there's very good communication. I think where the is perhaps slightly less, but obviously us being here today is a good example of where we're trying to bridge that is with the commercial sector and with technology organizations who can really have a pivotal role in helping us to make that leap towards making this content more accessible, more digital and support the underlying. It provides some of the underlying infrastructure, which is quite hard for us to provide individually. But through organizations like Google, there is a potential to um, to provide,

Speaker 1:          51:47          let me get, let's give you that opportunity then. What would be the questions you'd ask of us as a partner in some of that journey? Where can you see that we have the most potential to be held?

Speaker 3:          51:55          Cool. So I mean I think there's a number of them are probably the three big ones are digitization, just simply trying to exploit some of the digitization technologies that you've got. Obviously you have enormous experience with the book digitization. This is quite a different proposition in one sense, but there are many parallels. So that's one. I think the foundational platforms, the hosting, the storage, the cloud infrastructure, that's a big challenge for us because it's truly global. But again, it's an area where Google can help. And I think the other big one is helping us to demonstrate the potential of a lot of this digital content. And that's where I think the machine learning, the computer vision, the um, technologies that can help us to exploit and extract data from all of this imagery that we're data generating. That's the third big area. I think

Speaker 1:          52:44          that's it. It sounds like that third area splits into sort of the, the intelligent extrapolations and so on that can engage in the policy and public fund as well as the captivating animations that that bring in. Absolutely. So we can engage

Speaker 3:          52:56          snapchat, accomplish and do the science and really tell the public about that science

Speaker 1:          53:02          and see, hey, is here from the Cultural Institute team you want to get, just give a wave. So if people want to sort of say, Hey, I'd love to help follow up on this, then that's the place to, that's the place to talk. Any final questions from anybody? We're about to be out of time.

Speaker 5:          53:15          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          53:16          Okay. So I have a, I have a final question. Uh, you know, it, given where you are in your field and the progress that you're seeing made, what would you predict it in sort of 10 years is going to have been a breakthrough, uh, that's, that could be achieved in, in any of the fields that you're working in. Where, where do you see that there's some, some potential for something significant to change?

Speaker 3:          53:35          I think definitely for me it's the potential force and species or times on recognition and images. I think that's going to be truly transformative to the kind of science that we can do because it empowers people who are frankly not necessarily very informed about the natural world to suddenly be able to record and document it. If we can automatically do things like identify species from that imagery that has a revolutionizes fieldwork, for example, imagine the fact that we have to send physically lots of people out to these sometimes very dangerous places to do that work. We can basically put devices into those places and do that recording in an automated way. We can do things like identify when new things that we didn't know about. I've come into a region when things that, um, maybe some of those are new species, maybe some of those things are um, uh, uh, things that we simply didn't know were there that is going to have a huge transformative impact I think on how we understand the natural world.

Speaker 1:          54:36          Well so that the entire planet becomes your collection. Exactly. Yeah. Do you have a similar view?

Speaker 2:          54:42          Um, I'll have to be a bit different from Vince. I agree with that. That's, you know, the new expedition, the new global expedition using new technologies and stuff. The one thing I would add to what we've spoken about so far is everything we've just spoken about now you also link that to genomic information. So we also want to understand how life evolves and how it works. Now, I would say that you guys would probably know more about this than me, but if you think about, um, where we are in terms of digital technology, um, genomes have been going along a similar trajectory. The old, the old approach was kind of let's try and get one genome for one species. We've done it. Now we've got um, genomes for maybe a hundred species, jolly good. Now we're starting to do a little bit of population. So a thousand or 10,000 humans get a bit of variety in there.

Speaker 2:          55:29          Really exciting is, but in the same way as technology has got faster and better in the digital realm and cheaper exactly the same as happened in the genomic realm as well. So now we're into biodiversity genomics. So you look at the forms of all the different animals and plants around you. We want to understand how that happened and what it means for their evolution and again, for their responses to future change. So there's a big database over there that's growing really rapidly, all about genomes. This is where a lot of the information is actually, the biological information is thought. We've got to link those two together, and I think there's going to be a lot of fun doing that.

Speaker 1:          56:05          Well, I want to say thank you for enduring my simplistic questions, but there's a real sense here of a field that is ready for a big acceleration at a time, which we probably need it more than ever. So I want to say a big thank you to doctor. Ian owns doctor Vince Smith for all their time and for our partnership with the Natural History Museum. Thank you very much.
