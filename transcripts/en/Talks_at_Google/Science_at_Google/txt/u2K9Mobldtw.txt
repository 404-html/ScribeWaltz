Speaker 1:          00:00:06       Fantastic. Well, um, thank you Alex for over promising, I hope to under deliver. Um, and thank you everybody for being here today. I'm really excited to be talking to Google. Um, before I get started, I just want to gauge where the audience is. So, um, if you have a background in physics, like you've ever taken a course in quantum mechanics, can you raise your hand? Okay. So that's like maybe two thirds, one half to two thirds. It's good if you have no formal training in physics and you just think that quantum mechanics is cool or that physics is interesting. Raise your hand. Okay, good, good. So this talk is going to be aimed primarily or at the level of people who haven't taken any courses in quantum mechanics, but at the end, in the Q and a, we can get as technical as we want.

Speaker 1:          00:00:56       There's all sorts of stuff that I'm not mentioning in his talk, which we can get into in the Q and a. So like if you are annoyed that I don't mention decoherence for example, we can talk about it in the Q and. A. I can explain why I didn't mention it. So let's talk about quantum physics. Quantum physics is fantastic, but there was a problem with it. There's a hole at the heart of the theory. And just to be clear, uh, quantum physics works. It works tremendously well. Uh, it is by almost any measure, the most successful scientific theory that humanity has ever devised. I had explains an enormous variety of phenomena. It's the physics of the ultra tiny, but it goes well beyond that. It explains why the Sunshine's, it explains why we can see that the sun shines a, it is what almost every single piece of technology in this room or in the world runs on a, it even explains why you're not sinking through the chairs that you're sitting in right now because quantum mechanics explains why anything is ever solid.

Speaker 1:          00:01:56       Uh, so it's, it's just a phenomenally successful theory. And, uh, anybody who says otherwise is, you know, has no idea what they're talking about. It is a good theory, but there is a problem. The problem is that it is just not clear what quantum physics is telling us about the world around us. The connection between the theory though it's phenomenally successful and the world that we're in is just not obvious. And to explain what I mean by that, say that I want to figure out where this marker is. Right? So right now if I want to use Newton's physics, you know the, the pre quantum classical physics to figure out where this marker is, I need three numbers to describe where it is. I need to say, okay, it's a certain height above the ground, it's a certain distance in front of me and it's a certain distance off to my left.

Speaker 1:          00:02:51       But if I want to say where this thing is in quantum mechanics, if I want to describe its position, I need more than three numbers. I need an infinity of numbers scattered across all of space. And this is known as a wave function. And this is, you know, somewhat odd that we need an infinity of numbers. But you know, oddness is fine. The trouble with quantum mechanics isn't that it's strange. Strangeness Is Okay, the World is a strange place. If our theories weren't weird, they wouldn't be able to account for what we see. Uh, the trouble is more complex than that. See, wave functions obey this very, very nice equation called the Schrodinger equation. It's a really beautiful differential equation. It sort of smells like a law of physics, right? It, uh, it's, it's the quantum mechanics equivalent of Newton's second law. F equals m.

Speaker 1:          00:03:46       A. It's a good equation. We like it. It's pretty, it says that wave functions wave, it says that the unusual late smoothly and they don't make sudden changes. They don't do anything. Well, they do some surprising things, but they don't make any sudden moves. Um, but, but the strange thing is that wave functions don't always obey the Schrodinger equation. Sometimes when we go and look for a thing, the wave function of that thing suddenly doesn't obey the Schrodinger equation anymore. The Schrodinger equation is temporarily suspended. When we make a measurement and instead the wave function collapses. All those numbers scattered across all of space. They go to zero everywhere except in the place where we found the object. Now that's somewhat strange, right? Like I said, the Schrodinger equation smells like a law of physics. We don't expect the laws of physics to get temporarily suspended when we make a measurement.

Speaker 1:          00:04:43       Uh, that's, that's just odd. What's even otter is, it's, it's kind of hard to define what we mean by measurement. What's a measurement? It's a measurement. When I measure the measurements only when I measure, why am I giving you a talk about quantum mechanics where not only applies to me a solid system isn't really a good look on anybody and it's not a good look for physics. Um, is it only when humans measure? Now Einstein asked, can a mouse collapse the wave function? Uh, that doesn't seem quite right either. It seems like it shouldn't really have to, anything to do with life or consciousness. That's, that's not where we want to go. And, and that doesn't really make the idea of measurement less weird anyway. Maybe it's when a big thing interacts with this world of the ultra tiny, the world of the quantum, but there's no experimental evidence that that's correct.

Speaker 1:          00:05:33       And in fact, there is a great deal of evidence that suggests that quantum mechanics doesn't have that kind of size limit. So there's just a host of thorny problems here about what we mean by measurement. When wave functions collapse, what prompts them to collapse? What's going on here? And this is given a special name, it's called the measurement problem. Now it's tempting to say that what's really going on here is that the wave function isn't a thing in the world. It's just a measure of probability in some way. And that is the standard way of thinking about wave functions is that they just tell us the probability of finding a thing in a particular spot. And then you know, the idea of collapse somewhat, you know, it looks somewhat less strange it because then you know, okay, we don't know where it is. And then we look and we find it and now we know where it is.

Speaker 1:          00:06:22       And so the probability of it being elsewhere has gone to zero. And that's why wave functions collapse. But it can't be quite that straightforward because wave functions do some things that we associate with physical waves like water waves or sound waves or light waves. Wave functions can actually cause interference patterns to appear. That's not something that we think of mere probabilities as being able to do that doesn't mean that it's not probability. It just means that if it is, it's not straight forward. There has to be a more complicated story here to explain what's going on and there's also the question of, okay, so before we measure where is the object that's described by this sort of spread out wave function, where is the marker before we look forward? If it's way function is scattered across all of space. Now the standard answer here is to say that it's not really in one place or another.

Speaker 1:          00:07:13       It's, it's in multiple places at once and you know, we don't see markers in more than one place at once, but you know, maybe subatomic particles, maybe atoms and molecules can perform that kind of trick. But if we concede that, if we say, yeah, that's definitely what's going on, then we run into the most famous version of the measurement pub problem, which is Schrodinger's cat. And you knew that this was coming. It's a talk on quantum physics. So, uh, Schrodinger put this together in 1935 he said, okay, say that you take a cat and a bunch of equipment, you seal it inside of a box. You can't see what's going on in there. But what you've put in there with the cat is a very weak radioactive source. So lump of slightly radioactive metals, and you've hooked it up to a Geiger counter and the Geiger counter detects that radiation.

Speaker 1:          00:08:01       And if it detects radiation, it releases the hammer, which smashes the vial of cyanide, which kills the cat. So of measurement is really what collapses way functions. Then the wave function of this whole system shouldn't collapse until you open the box. In other words, this piece of radiation that comes out from the radioactive metal, that's definitely a quantum object. It's a small thing, right? So it definitely obeys the laws of quantum physics, which means that it's, you know, in this traditional way of thinking about wave functions is probability. It means that it's both been released and remains in the metal, which means that the Geiger counter both goes off and doesn't go off, which means that the hammer falls and doesn't fall. The cyanide is smashed and doesn't smash and the cat is dead and alive until we opened the box and Schrodinger Yuri is said, this is ridiculous.

Speaker 1:          00:08:55       You know, maybe subatomic particles can be in more than one place at once, but cats are definitely not both dead and alive until we open the box. That just can't be right. That doesn't make any sense. And the fact that this is what the theory seems to imply with the equation, that by the way, guys, I wrote down, that seems wrong, right? That doesn't seem to be the way that the world works. And that doesn't mean that quantum physics is wrong. It's definitely not wrong. It's just not done yet. It's not complete. Or there's something else beyond it. And this shouldn't be controversial, right? The idea that our scientific theories aren't the whole story. Yeah, sure. There's going to be another theory. You know, nobody thinks that our scientific theories that we have right now are the end of the story. And that's all the Schrodinger was trying to say.

Speaker 1:          00:09:40       He was saying there's something incomplete here in our understanding of what's going on in quantum physics, but despite the fact that this seems reasonable and straightforward, most of Schrodinger's contemporaries profoundly disagreed with him. So people like Niels Bohr, uh, or Verner, Heisenberg, Boris, the guy on the left of that picture from my perspective. So I guess right from your perspective, Heisenberg is the younger one on the other side. So, um, Bohr and Heisenberg, two of the other sort of founders of quantum physics, they profoundly disagree with Schrodinger as did many of Schrodinger's contemporaries. And many of the other people who put together quantum physics, they said, no, this is wrong. This whole thing with the cat, it's a misunderstanding. Some of them said, yeah, you know, it's just wrong to talk about what's going on in the box before we open it. Because what's going on in the box before we look is in principle on observable.

Speaker 1:          00:10:41       And it's on the scientific to talk about on observable things. In fact, it's meaningless to talk about unobservable things. This is, this is the lesson of the philosophy of language that comes out of quantum physics. Others said, no, no, no, no, no. It's not that. It's meaningless. It's that opening the box really does force the cat to be dead or alive. And until we look, it really isn't either one. Others said, no, no, no, no, no. Quantum physics you've completely missed supplied to this theory that you helped develop. Quantum physics has by necessity a split between the measurer and the measured. And the problem with the cat experiment that you've set up is you're trying to get rid of that division. And that's what's leading to the confusion. Uh, and others said, no. You know, you're, you're trying to say that quantum physics tells us how the world is.

Speaker 1:          00:11:28       Quantum physics isn't about how the world is. Quantum physics is just a tool that we use to predict the outcomes of measurements. That's all it is. It's an instrument. It's not a theory about the state of the world. And this collection of vague related questionably, coherent contradictory claims. This is known as the Copenhagen interpretation. This named after the home of Neil Spores Institute in Copenhagen, which was the center of the physics world for much of the first half of the 20th century. And the Copenhagen interpretation, like I said, this seems somewhat country contradictory. It seems somewhat vague. Uh, what does it have to say about the measurement problem? What does it say leaves to wave function collapses? What does it say is going on there? How do we define what measurement is? How do we say when wave functions collapsed, when does the Schrodinger equation apply and when is it suspended?

Speaker 1:          00:12:30       The standard answer that the Copenhagen interpretation gives to all of these thorny questions at the heart of the theory is somewhat unsatisfying. Um, basically it says, shut up and calculate. Um, and, and this is not quite as foolish as it first appears because again, quantum physics works remarkably well. It is incredibly good. I can't stress this enough. I mean quantum physics, uh, is, is really responsible for most of the technological breakthroughs of the last 90 years. It is an incredibly good theory and these questions at the heart of it really seemed very thorny. And so you have a choice of either trying to bang your head against these questions or you know, contribute to one of the greatest revolutions in the history of science revolution that gave rise not only too much of modern technology but much of modern science. I mean the whole field of genetics was based on imaging breakthroughs that came from quantum physics for example.

Speaker 1:          00:13:31       Um, but shutting up in calculating, saying all of these things that the Copenhagen interpretation wants to tell us, it is unsatisfying. And I'll take questions at the end. I really will. This talk is not going to take the whole time nowhere near. Um, uh, but I, I'm excited to hear your question. So, um, there, there is a problem with shutting up and calculate and there are several problems. One problem is that, you know, we, we want to understand what is going on in the world. Quantum physics tells us why the sun shines. But if quantum physics really is just an instrument for predicting outcomes, quantum physics doesn't tell us why the sun shines. It has no explanatory power at all. It only has predictive power. So it doesn't explain why I'm not passing through the floor. It doesn't explain why I can see. It just says I won't pass through the floor.

Speaker 1:          00:14:29       It doesn't tell us where those things come from. It doesn't give us a picture of the world. Uh, and if that sounds a little bit wishy washy, let me make it more clear. Quantum physics, if the Copenhagen interpretation is correct, there's no reason why it's true. There's no reason why it works. In fact, its success is just a coincidence because quantum physics, according to the Copenhagen interpretation, isn't about anything in the world. There's nothing in the world that is even approximately described by the equations of quantum physics. And if that's true, why does the theory work? What makes it true? The fact that it works at all, even though it has no connection to anything in reality, would be nothing short of a miracle, a phenomenal coincidence if it's just a trick for calculating that has no relationship to the things in the world around us.

Speaker 1:          00:15:23       On top of that, uh, there are some scientific projects that we want to do as physicists, which the Copenhagen interpretation explicitly or implicitly makes very difficult to impossible. We want to think that measurement is a physical process and physical processes should be amenable to analysis. We should be able to come up with a physical theory of how measurement works, but the Copenhagen interpretation says, no, you can't do that. There is no need or way to come up with a quantum theory of measurement. In fact, Niels Bohr himself said that coming up with the quantum theory of measurement was fundamentally misguided as a scientific project. We also, and I mean this is near and dear to my heart, this next one, we want to be able to do cosmology. We want to be able to study the entire universe at once. Um, but if we have to split the universe into the measured and the measurer, we can't do that.

Speaker 1:          00:16:21       And if we have to split the universe into the measured and the measure, we have an even bigger problem. We want to account for classical physics, the physics of Isaac Newton using quantum physics. That's why the theory was developed. It was developed to explain situations that we couldn't explain using classical physics. And yet if measurements are, are a necessary part of the theory on those measurements cannot be described using quantum physics. They can only be described using classical physics. Again, as Niels Bohr and company said, then we can't ground classical physics in quantum physics. If anything, it's the other way around. The logical foundations of quantum physics require classical physics. And that seems really strange, especially because there's nothing particularly special about classical physics. You know, uh, Bohr and Heisenberg, they said things like, oh, the idea of measurement has to be grounded in classical physics because that's the way our intuitions work.

Speaker 1:          00:17:16       They read a lot of cons. Um, and that's not true because classical physics is profoundly counter intuitive. Our intuitions are no more classical than they are grounded in witchcraft or astrology or classical physics has many surprising results. If you've ever done that thing where you sit in a spinning chair and you hold the bicycle wheel, I didn't see that coming the first time they did that. I don't think any of us do. So yeah, that, that can't be right either. So the Copenhagen interpretation is profoundly unsatisfying both scientifically and philosophically. Now it's time for a couple of disclaimers. So here's the thing, despite the fact that the Copenhagen interpretation is unsatisfactory, it is still the default interpretation. It is the standard interpretation of quantum physics today. It is what is used in most popular science books on the subject. It is what is presented in basically every single widely used quantum physics textbook in undergraduate and graduate courses.

Speaker 1:          00:18:24       I was exposed to it in that way as well. Um, it's what you learned in school. It is what many, if not most physicists believe to be true and they believe this to hold the answer to the measurement problem, especially older physicist as the Copenhagen interpretation was once massively overwhelmingly dominant. It's dominance has declined over the last few decades. So the first disclaimer is what I just told you is a minority view. I am in the minority. What I just told you is not, you know, the standard story that you get in a quantum physics class. So given that this is a minority view, why am I so sure that I'm right? Why am I so willing to come up here to Google? And other places have been giving this talk and say, yeah, no, the Copenhagen interpretation doesn't work. Well, there is definitely some controversy over the foundations of quantum physics among physicists, but the history and philosophy of quantum physics, that's a different story.

Speaker 1:          00:19:28       In broad strokes, there is an understanding of what happened over the last 90 years and the development of quantum physics and the philosophy underpinning the stories that we tell about quantum physics and that history and philosophy is wildly unknown to most physicists. Physicists have a set of historical and philosophical myths that they tell amongst themselves, kind of folk history that's passed down from generation to generation of physicists, either explicitly or implicitly about the history of quantum physics. And why we believe the things that we're told to believe about it, that folk history is very wrong. It is just as a matter of historical fact incorrect. And I'm going to explain to you what that folk history is and then tell you what actually happened. Which leads me to my second disclaimer, which is that the best psych research suggests that if you're trying to debunk a myth, you shouldn't repeat the myth first.

Speaker 1:          00:20:28       Um, I'm gonna throw caution to the wind and tell you this. Folk history, this completely mythical account of the history of quantum physics. And then I'm going to tell you why it's wrong. So with all the stuff that I'm about to tell you, take it with a grain of salt. So here we go. Once upon a time, there was a group of phenomenally talented physicists, uh, working in a loose team in the first quarter of the 20th century to try to understand what was going on in the world of the ultra tiny, the world of atoms and subatomic particles. Now, this team didn't have a leader per se, but they had a kind of spiritual guide in their request. And that was Niels Bohr, who again, is, he's the older guy in the picture over off on the side. Um, and this team also included phenomenally talented physicists like Verner Heisenberg in the Middle Paoli sitting across from Bor.

Speaker 1:          00:21:28       Um, and many other physicists be besides, you know, Erwin Schrodinger, her, uh, Louis boy, uh, a wide collection of physicists. And over the course of the first quarter of the 20th century, they developed the first real theories of quantum mechanics. And with these theories came a single unified picture of how to think about quantum mechanics called the Copenhagen interpretation. And the Copenhagen interpretation said questions about what's happening before you look at quantum objects are meaningless. It's not sensical to even ask those questions. The world is fundamentally random and quantum mechanics is the best theory that we can come up with to understand what's going on in the quantum world. And this really bothered Albert Einstein. Most physicists were very happy to accept this, but Einstein, Einstein had once been a bomb throwing revolutionary in his youth. He had, he had blown up the physics world with special relativity and then 10 years later, general relativity.

Speaker 1:          00:22:32       But that was long ago. Uh, now he was old. He was stuck in his ways. He was conservative, and he couldn't accept that quantum physics could be fundamentally random. He couldn't accept that the world wasn't deterministic. He was sure that the theory had to be self contradictory or if not contradictory, incomplete or wrong in some fundamental way, because determinism had to be true according to Einstein. So he developed a set of thought experiments intended to show that the theory was contradictory. And in particular he went after this thing called the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. And the Heisenberg uncertainty principle says that you can't know both the position and the velocity, the moment really the momentum, but whatever the position and the momentum of an object at the same time too arbitrary precision. He came up with a bunch of thought experiments to try to show that this wasn't true, but bore and bores team of researchers showed at every turn that Einstein was incorrect, that he had misunderstood things and this culminated in a thought experiment where Einstein devised a box filled with light that was hanging on a scale spring with a clock attached to it and a little door in the side and he showed that you could use this to get around a different uncertainty relationship and quantum physics, the energy time, uncertainty relation, but bore took a look at this thing and prove that Einstein was wrong for an incredibly embarrassing reason.

Speaker 1:          00:24:02       He said, Einstein, you forgotten your own theory of general relativity, which shows that this cannot work. You cannot use this device to get around the energy time, uncertainty relationship. Einstein, of course, was incredibly embarrassed and he laid low for a while and then he came up with a new thought experiment that was going to show the world that quantum physics couldn't be correct. And so he came up with something called the EPR thought experiment named after Einstein and his two coauthors on the paper Podolsky and Rosen and the EPR paper showed that you had to be able to get around the uncertainty principle. And if you couldn't, that would mean that either quantum physics was incomplete or that there was something going faster than light. Somehow Bor responded to this. You know, Einstein said nothing could possibly be going faster than light. That would be spooky. Action at a distance board gave a response, you know, brilliantly dismissing Einstein's concerns.

Speaker 1:          00:25:00       Most physicists thought, okay, you know, that's the end of it. We still don't quite know which one could be right, but you know, it's a matter of philosophy. We don't need to think about that. And then 30 years later, after both Bohr and Einstein were dead, a physicist named John Bell came along and he proved that Bora was right. And Einstein was wrong, and that you could not have some more complete theory of how quantum physics works without violating the predictions of quantum physics. And thus the world was made safe for quantum physics and everybody lived happily ever after. So how much of what I just told you is true? Not a whole lot. Most of that is just wrong. As a matter of historical fact, if you look at contemporary evidence, you know letters that people sent to each other lecture notes rather than looking at, you know, people's recollections of what happened years after the fact.

Speaker 1:          00:26:00       Here's what actually happened. It is true that Bohr and Heisenberg and Paoli and a group of brilliant physicists did put together the first true theories of quantum physics. It is true that Einstein was among them and that Einstein didn't like the theory. Einstein though, when these debates between him and board started in the mid to late 1920s, he, um, he was in his forties. He wasn't exactly old and senile. He was in perfectly good shape. And his main concern actually had nothing to do with the fact that quantum physics presented a world that was, you know, fundamentally random. He had two major concerns aside from that one that was like a secondary or tertiary concern. He was concerned that quantum physics didn't give us a real picture of the world independent of observation. So he's concerned about realism and he was also concerned and he felt that these were two sides of the same coin, that because quantum physics was not relist, it was also doomed to have nonlocality spooky action at a distance. Things influencing, influencing each other at a distance faster than the speed of light. Instantaneously. Even nine sign felt that that couldn't be right. Not only because it would violate relativity, but because he felt it would make it near impossible to do science.

Speaker 1:          00:27:25       And he thought the Copenhagen interpretation was not only not realist, but in so far as it was relist, it was nonlocal and that he could not abide. And so he came up with a series of thought experiments not to get around the uncertainty principles. Mostly he had one or two like that. Mostly his thought experiments were intended to show that quantum physics was a local. This one was meant to show that quantum physics was nonlocal. It had nothing to do with the energy, time on certainty relationship aside from the fact that it did enter into the setup in a way, but Einstein wasn't trying to get around it any way. Bor completely misunderstood what Einstein was trying to get at with this setup. He thought Einstein was trying to get around the energy, time on certainty relationship, and thus show that quantum physics was inconsistent internally and then in order to answer this supposedly argument from Einstein. Bohr brought in a totally separate theory that we still don't know how to make consistent with quantum physics in order to defend the internal consistency of quantum physics. In other words, he gave a profoundly inadequate argument in response to an argument that Einstein wasn't even making. This should have been a massive embarrassment for Neil Spore

Speaker 1:          00:28:45       and the standard story around this. This thought experiment is just completely confused. Einstein, meanwhile went home and thought, you know, Shit, boar still doesn't understand what I'm getting at. Let me make it simpler for him. Thus was born the EPR thought experiment. And so after more debates between Einstein and Bohr, Einstein put together this thought experiment, the EPR thought experiment. He published it with his friends, collaborators, Podolsky and Rosen. And after it came out, he actually wasn't that happy with the way that the paper was put together, but he then wrote about it more in both letters and essays through the rest of his life. Um, and he made it very clear that the point of this thing was that there was a forced choice. There was a choice for quantum physics. It could either be incomplete and local or complete and nonlocal. So he was saying if the Copenhagen interpretation is really the end of the story than something has to be going faster than light or gave a response to the APR paper.

Speaker 1:          00:29:56       It was really, really hard to understand what bores response was saying. And I'm not just saying that because I've read it and it makes no frigging sense. I'm saying that because Boris said it did. It was hard to understand. [inaudible] actually wrote about this about 15 years later, he wrote about these debates that he had with Einstein completely mischaracterized them, and then when he got to that part, he said, I responded to the EPR paper. I apologize for being so difficult to understand, and then he moved on. He didn't actually explain what he meant. He just said, I know it was hard to understand, and then he moved on. Nonetheless, despite the fact that bore his writing was sort of convoluted in obscure people felt that these deep philosophical puzzles at the heard of the theory, we're actually better addressed by convoluted, obscure writing. That may be answers unclear rather than Einstein's very clear direct writing.

Speaker 1:          00:30:45       That made it obvious that there was a problem here. Part of that was because you know this confusion between obscurity and profundity, part of it was that bore worked collaboratively with a group of people throughout his entire life and so he had more people just on his side politically. Whereas Einstein, with someone who usually worked alone, Einstein described himself as going through life like a one horse cart. He did not really work with people. He didn't build a school of thought around himself, and part of it was just an Einstein was making very uncomfortable argument. Einstein was saying, no, we're not done. There's more work to be done here. Whereas board was saying, no, it's cool. Let's go off and keep doing what we've been doing. You don't have to worry about this. You can just shut up and calculate. Now, part of the reason that board won the day was also that there was a proof by John von Neumann that had been published in 1932 saying that there was no way to come up with a more complete theory of quantum physics that you couldn't, you know, add something to the theory and thus get, you know, something, not statistical, something that that gives you more complete picture of reality without actually changing the predictions of the theory and nobody, not even Einstein, wanted to change the predictions of the theory because the theory is phenomenally successful.

Speaker 1:          00:32:06       So von Neumann's proof and bores writings sort of helped quantum physics carry along. Now, there was just one problem. Von Noi, I'm in one of the greatest mathematicians to have ever lived. Made a mistake, has proof was wrong. This was actually pointed out by the mathematician, Gretta Herman only a few years later. But people didn't listen to her probably in part because she was a woman. Uh, and in the 1930s women we're usually not even allowed to teach at universities, much less proof John von Neumann wrong. Um, so quantum physics just sort carrying on with a whole lot. It's hard piling success upon success over the course of the Manhattan project and World War Two, which incidentally after the Manhattan project and all that money poured into physics classroom sizes ballooned and the historian of physics, David Kaiser at Mit has done a fascinating study showing that the amount of time devoted to foundational questions in quantum physics in you know, course syllabi after World War II is inversely proportional to classroom size.

Speaker 1:          00:33:10       So the larger the classroom, the less time they spend talking about these questions at the heart of quantum physics, which makes some sense, it's hard to address them properly. So after the war, young physicist named David Boehme came up with a different way of thinking about quantum physics. He discovered that you could just take the equations as they were and develop an entirely different picture of nature to go along with it. One that involved waves and particles and was entirely deterministic in particular. It involves particles, sort of surfing on waves and those waves would guide the particles, the waves could interfere with themselves and with other waves and they would guide the, you know, motion of the particles to, you know, appear in the correct locations as to make the predictions of quantum physics true. And this became known as pilot wave theory. But this was largely dismissed at the time in part because of annoyance proof in part because boars ideas had already become entrenched over the quarter century before that and part because David Boehme had, um, I'm going to go ahead and call it shit luck.

Speaker 1:          00:34:21       Uh, David Boehme got really interested in communism in the 1940s and then he got called up before the House on American Activities Committee, uh, in the late 1940s chaired by, um, someone who probably haven't heard of named Richard Nixon. And, um, and then he got arrested on contempt of Congress because he wouldn't name names because he had, you know, integrity. And, um, and then he was cleared because it turns out there is in fact a fifth amendment of the United States constitution. Um, but it didn't matter. He was blacklisted. He was fired from his job at Princeton. And in fact, it was while he was waiting for his day in court that he developed pilot wave theory, um, which had, by the way, part of it had been previously discovered 25 years earlier by Louis deploy. But, um, but Boehm sort of independently rediscovered it and then completed the theory. But bomb was cleared on all charges.

Speaker 1:          00:35:16       But he was blacklisted at this, happened right after he submitted his papers, even before they were published. Um, couldn't find a job to work in physics anywhere in the u s despite having recommendation letters from Robert Oppenheimer and Albert Einstein, um, and ended up having to go to Brazil, at which point his passport was confiscated illegally by the American Consulate. And he was trapped in Brazil for almost five years. During which time his papers were published, discussed without him being around, he could only corresponded a distance. Many famous physicist's published papers or gave talks explaining my bone was wrong without bone being there to defend himself. And ultimately his ideas were forgotten by most physicists, but not all. John Bell Read David Boams papers in 1952 when they were first published and he immediately knew that something was wrong, not with belts, but not with bones papers. He had been told of John von Neumann is proof not have Gretta Hermanns, you know, disproof of fond Nyman's proof because nobody knew about that.

Speaker 1:          00:36:23       But he'd been told avant diamonds proof, even though he had always found the Copenhagen interpretation hopelessly vague. He said he knew it was a rotten, um, he figured there had to be something better. But then he was told about von diamonds proof and figured, okay, you know, I must just not be understanding something. And then he saw boams papers work through them and realize, no, there's nothing wrong with this. There must be a flaw on this proof problem. Bell didn't speak German. The proof was only published in German. He couldn't go in and figure out what was wrong with it until it was published in English a few years later, and by then bell was busy with other things. But in 1963, bell came out to the South Bay, actually. He got invited to be a visitor for a year while he was on sabbatical from cern. He was a visitor at slack just down the road.

Speaker 1:          00:37:12       And while he was at slack, he figured, you know, I really hate the Copenhagen interpretation. It just can't be right. And yet there's this proof from von Neumann and these other proofs along the same lines, I know that they're wrong because there's nothing wrong with bones version of quantum physics. And these proofs would rule it out. Let me figure out what's wrong with those proofs. So he sits down, plays with them for awhile, and he finds that von Neumann's proof is not only broken. He later characterized it as silly. So he publishes a paper showing that von Neumann is wrong, which gets lost in an editor's desk for a couple of years. It was really unfortunate. But then he says, okay, but there's something else funny about bones version of quantum physics. It has this spooky action at a distance. The position of a particle way over here can instantaneously affect the behavior of a pilot wave way over here that that seems strange.

Speaker 1:          00:38:05       You know, is there a way not doing that? Can I come up with something like bones version of quantum physics without having this instantaneous action at a distance? So he starts working on it and he realizes he can't do it. And then he writes up a proof and that proof has become known as bell's Theorem. Bell's Theorem is one of the single most profound and important results in all of quantum physics. It led to what's been called the second quantum revolution, which among other things led to the entire field of quantum information processing, quantum cryptography, quantum computing, you name it. Um, it's also profoundly misunderstood. People often characterize bell's theorem. Not only is proving that board was right, but that proving that you can't have anything like bones version of quantum physics or they'll say, oh, it proves that either something is going faster than light or you have hidden variables completing the Theorem, you know, completing quantum physics saying, okay, you know, this is what's going on before you look.

Speaker 1:          00:38:59       That's not true. Uh, in fact, uh, bell himself said that that wasn't true. That wasn't what the proof was about at all. It is pretty much just a proof that nature is not local. If it conforms with the predictions of quantum physics. There were only a couple of ways out of that. One of them was, oh, sorry, hold on. If you want to learn more about bell's Theorem, it is a whole subject for a talk by itself. I have an interactive essay explaining it in more detail on my website. Um, I'll leave that up there for a moment, but there are only a few ways out of belts near and people will sometimes say that realism is a way out of bell's Theorem. That's actually not true either because in order for realism to be a way out, you would need to deny the existence of an external reality to such an extent that the idea of locality itself would dissolve.

Speaker 1:          00:39:48       So that's kind of nuts. But another way out of Dallas Theorem was developed, uh, before bill did his work by a guy named Hugh Everett who came up with what is now known as the many worlds interpretation of quantum physics. Uh, which says that no, you know, wait, functions don't collapse. Instead, when you do Schrodinger's cat, what happens is the radioactive metal wave function gets mixed up with the wave function of the Geiger counter in the cyanide in the cat. And so now instead of a piece of radiation that's both in the metal and not in the metal, you have a cat that is both dead and alive. And then when you opened the box, you are wave function gets mixed up with these other way functions as well. And now there is a copy of you looking at a dead cat in a box and sad and a copy.

Speaker 1:          00:40:33       If you're looking at a living cat in a box and happy, I guess that you didn't kill a cat. Um, in any event, this is another way out of bell's Theorem. You can come up with a version of many worlds that is local because bell's theorem assumes that you only have one universe, but these are not the only two options on the table. There are many other interpretations of quantum physics available. It's just that the Copenhagen interpretation isn't one of them. There are other ways of doing this and given that there are ways of understanding what's actually going on in nature, just throwing up your hands and saying, I give up, we can't do it. There's no way to understand. It seems both profoundly inadequate and frankly unscientific. But you may be left with another question, a much, much deeper and more profound question. Who Cares if quantum physics works and why does any of this matter and it does work. As I've said over and over again, quantum physics definitely works, so why does it matter what it's telling us about the world? If we can use it to do whatever we want, I'm going to need to appeal to a higher authority on this one.

Speaker 2:          00:41:43       Now, another thing that people often say is that for getting two identical theories, theory, theory, which look completely different, psychological, different ideas in them and so on, but then all the consequences that a computer, all the consequence of the computer are exactly the same. Maybe replay they even agree with it's from the head. The point is though that the two theories, although they sound different at the beginning, have all kinds of quenches the same. It's easier usually to prove that mathematically by doing a little mathematics ahead of time to show that the logic from this one and this one will always give corresponding consequence. Suppose we have two such theories. How are we going to decide which one is right? No Way. Not by science because they both agree with experiments. At the same extent. There's no way to distinguish one from me. So on two theories all alone and they have dick deeply different ideas by them, maybe mathematically identical and they usually people say then in science when should pay.

Speaker 2:          00:42:43       One doesn't know how to distinguish him and that's right. However, for psychological reasons, in order to get new theories, these two things are very far from the film because one gives a man different ideas than the other. By putting the theory in a certain kind of framework, you get an idea of what the chain, which would be something printed in theory that talks about something. But you say, I'll change that idea here, but to find out what the car is funding thing is you're going to change in here. Amazing, very complicated. It may not be a simple idea. In other words, just simple change here makes maybe a very different theories and a simple change there. In other words, all they are identical before that change. There are certain ways of changing one which looked natural, which not look natural, and then the other. Therefore psychologically we must keep all the theories.

Speaker 2:          00:43:28       And I had and every theoretical physicists, it's any good. No. It was six or seven different theoretical representations for exactly the same physics and our knows that the tooth that they're all equivalent and that nobody is ever going to be able to decide which one is right at that level, but he keeps him in his head hoping that they'll give them different ideas for guests. It's a valley. That reminds me of another thing that is, that's the philosophy or the ideas around the theory. A lot of ideas you say, I believe there are, there is a space of time or something like that in order to discuss your analysis at these ideas change enormously when they were very tiny changes in the theory. In other words, sprinters, Newton's ideas about space and time agreeing with experiment very well, but in order to get the correct motion of the orbit of mercury, which was a tiny, tiny difference.

Speaker 2:          00:44:22       There's a difference in the character of the theory with which you started was enormous. Reason is these are so simple and so perfect that produce definite results in. If they get something that produced a little different results could be completely different. You can't make imperfections on appropriate thing. I have another sort of philosophical ideas between Newton's theory of gravitation and Einstein's theory of gravitation are enormous. Differences rather are enormous. What are these philosophies? These philosophies, I really freaky why? He used to compute consequences quickly. Our philosophy, which is sometimes called an understanding of the law, is simply a way that a person holds the laws in his mind was the guest quickly a consequences. Some people have said, and it's true, for instance, in the case of Maxwell's equations and other equations, nevermind the philosophy, nevermind anything of this kind just guessed the crate. The problem is only to compute the answer so that I agree with experiment and there's not necessarily to have a philosophy or argue or worries about the equation.

Speaker 2:          00:45:20       That's true in a sense. Yes, I know. It's good in the sense that you may be, if you only get the equation, you're not prejudice in yourself and your guests better and the other hand maybe the philosophy helps you to get. It's very hard to say for those people who insist, however, that the only thing that's important is that the theory agrees with experiment. I would like to make an imaginary discussion between a Mayan astronomer as students. The Mayans were able to calculate with great precision, great precision. The predictions, for example, three eclipses and the position of the moon in the sky, a position of Venus and side. However, it was all done by a the counter certain numbers or subtract some numbers and song. There was no discussion of what the moon was. There wasn't even a discussion of the idea that it went around. There was only calculate the time when there would be an eclipse or the time when it would rise.

Speaker 2:          00:46:12       They're full moon and when it would rise, have one saw and just calculated only supposedly the young man going to the astronomy and said, I have an idea. Maybe those things are going around, and then a balls of locks was like rocks out there. We could calculate how they move and a completely different way and just calculate what time they appeared, the scarring. So the of course the Miami [inaudible] would say yes. How accurate could you predict eclipses? You said, I haven't developed a thing very far. This is, but we can calculate equipped is more likely than you can with your model. And so you must not pay any attention to there's the mathematical scheme is better. And it was very strong tendency of people to say against some idea if someone comes up with an idea, so let's suppose the world was this way and you say to them, well how would you get, what would you get for the answer for such and such a problem? And he says, I haven't developed it far enough. And you say, wow, we have already developed that much further. We can get the answers very accurately. So it is a problem as to whether or not to worry about philosophies behind ideas.

Speaker 1:          00:47:16       So it's certainly true that you can use whatever interpretation of quantum physics you like and come up with the same predictions. And given that there is no test that you can perform to show which interpretation of quantum physics is correct, but the story of the world that goes along with the theories that we have in science plays a big role in the actual practice of science. It actually influences the way that we come up with new theories to go beyond the current theory. It influences, um, what experiments we conduct and it influences how we interpret the results of those experiments. Fiman gives an example of a, and this is in by the way, his book, the character of physical law, which is a compilation of the lectures that I was going to play a clip from. Um, Fineman, uh, gives the example of someone going to a Mayan astronomer, you know, back when the Mayan civilization was at its peak.

Speaker 1:          00:48:19       Uh, and saying, look, you know, I know we have this theory that says that, um, that that allows us to predict when it clips, this will happen and when Venus will transmit the sun and all these other things to phenomenal precision. But the theory doesn't tell us what Venus is or what the moon is. I have a theory that tells us all those things and it, and it, uh, and, and then the Mayan astronomer says, okay, but can you do the same things we can do? And the other guy says, well, no, I haven't developed it fully yet. It doesn't mean that we shouldn't listen to the other guy. Right. And it doesn't mean that even if he could get it to work just as well as my in astronomy, that doesn't mean that, you know, there's no difference between the choices we make in our theories.

Speaker 1:          00:48:58       It matters for the progress of science and it matters beyond just the realm of science as well. It matters for the entire world. Remember, throughout the history of humanity, this was at least in Europe, the dominant way of thinking about what the universe looked like throughout most of human history, the earth is at the center and everything moves around us. And it wasn't until Copernicus in the 15 hundreds that people started seriously considering the possibility that the earth is not at the center of everything. And without that move, without Copernicus on the centering the earth, it seems unlikely that Darwin would have had the audacity to say, yeah, humans are not at the center of creation either. We're just another part of a giant tree of life. And without those two insights, our entire modern world, not just science, book, culture, art, movies, would look entirely different. Kubrick would never have been able to film in 2001 not that that's, you know, the pinnacle achievement of humanity and the 20th century. But I really like that movie. Uh, and, and I think it's an important piece of art. And there were other very important pieces of art, science, religion, politics, economics, all of the realms of human experience and endeavor are effected by the stories that we get from our science. And in fact, this is how we do every other piece of science. You know, nobody says, oh, genes aren't

Speaker 3:          00:50:28       real. They're just a way of explaining the outcomes of electron microscope observations and genetics experiments. Nobody says, or at least physicists usually don't say spacetime isn't real. It's just something that helps us understand the outcomes at Lego. We don't say electromagnetic fields aren't real. We're very willing to grant reality to things except when it comes to quantum physics and the reasons for that are largely historical. Um, I've written a book that is about all of this. Uh, there were copies of the back, but it looks like everyone's snapped them up. That's great. Uh, you can buy it online. Um, you can go find it anywhere. Books are sold. Um, and if you do that will make me happy. I hope you enjoy it. Um, you can get ahold of me relatively easily if you want to ask me questions about anything in there. I discuss all of this in much greater detail in the book and the book is like this talk, I hope, understandable for people who have no physics background at all. The intended audience is just the interested public. So, uh, with that, thank you for your time. Any questions?

Speaker 4:          00:51:38       Thanks.

Speaker 5:          00:51:40       I guess putting the historical, putting things historically correct, uh, Einstein has also attributed to this quote of God doesn't play, you know, it doesn't roll the die and, um, play with the ice. And, uh, so you probably, that might have also been taken out of context, you know, if he, if he actually didn't, his biggest problems weren't with, as you said that the randomness, but yeah. But more with this action at a distance. It sounds like that quote was also kind of out of context.

Speaker 3:          00:52:07       I think that's correct, given that Einstein famously said that God doesn't play dice with the universe. Um, you know, it sounds like that was taken out of context given that his primary problem with quantum physics was not randomness. Um, I'm sorry, Alex, can you take the computer and do that? Sure. Yeah. Thank you. Um, I can't actually go. Okay. That's fine. Um, so yeah, I think that's right. It was, it's not so much that it was taken out of context as it is that it's not, it was a real problem that he had. He did not like the randomness of quantum physics. Um, he just also didn't like other things about quantum physics even more. I mean, he also said, you know, I can't abide spooky action at a distance that that got closer to his real problem. And he also said some very quotable things about his problems with the, you know, non realism of the Copenhagen interpretation.

Speaker 3:          00:53:01       Um, they're just not as well known. And I think that that's largely because, you know, the idea of God playing dice is, is this very sort of sexy image. Um, and also because, you know, it, it conforms with this standard incorrect narrative among physicists about the history of physics. I'm like, you know, Einstein also said, uh, and I, I love this quote so much. He said that, um, regarding the Copenhagen interpretation that it was a soft pillow, uh, that, um, that, uh, the, the true believer can rest his head on, but it provides very little comfort to him. Or he also said that, you know, again, regarding the Copenhagen interpretation and its denial of reality, he said that this epistemology fueled orgy must come to an end. Um, and I went and looked that up thinking, you know, okay, maybe the translation from the German took a few liberties. It's right in there. It's something like epistemology or g. Uh, so yeah, know Einstein was, was pretty clear about what his problem was. It's just not been represented properly.

Speaker 6:          00:54:03       Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 7:          00:54:07       Let's do, uh, um, on the online question for okay. And then we can alternate. Yep. Okay. Sounds good. So what's the online question? What are your thoughts on the Conway Colin a freewill serum, which basically says that there's a finite set of experiments such that there is no consistent set of possible outcomes for all the experiments.

Speaker 3:          00:54:26       This is a question about my thoughts on the Conway Coken freewill experiment. It's a good question. Uh, I'm going to say something that will probably piss off people in response. The Conway cocaine freewill Theorem is just an attempt to repackage bell's theorem along with a different result and known as contextuality, which is actually also due to bell. Uh, it was bells demolition of von Nivens proof that I talked about earlier. Um, I don't think that there's anything in there that is Indian, those two proofs. And I think that mostly what it means is that the area's nonlocality in nature or something else. One of the other ways out of bell's theorem must be true, like multiple universes. Um, so yeah, maybe not the most interesting response to that, but I actually don't find the result terribly interesting either.

Speaker 6:          00:55:16       Okay.

Speaker 8:          00:55:17       So I find it very surprising this, that are prominent physicists who don't think that's what the mechanics is a unitary or violate something, uh, need mathematical properties. It's an unlikeable. Uh, so what words mean you, you've had some interesting discussions with Peter White's, uh, I mean it's Sabine Hudson Felder's a prominent blogger who doesn't believe in the multiverse. Uh, uh, so what did the shut up and calculate people say happens, uh, in the show there in gears, cats scenario for some, for a sufficiently small cat?

Speaker 3:          00:55:59       That's a good question. Um, so first of all, let me make it clear. I am not saying, Oh, the multiverse is definitely true. I am saying, I am saying, okay, good. Yeah, no, it's a viable option, but, well, some people don't seem to understand that. That's what I'm saying. Um, I dunno. I thought I'd made it pretty clear in my book and in the dog, but um, yeah, I, so you're asking what the Copenhagen interpretation people say happens to the cat? Schrodinger's cat for a sufficiently small cat. Um, that's an excellent question. I am strongly tempted to give a very glib answer and save. They don't say what happens to the cat. They don't say what happens to anything because their interpretation is profoundly anti realist. Um, if I wanted to be more charitable, I would say you have to pick a version of the Copenhagen interpretation.

Speaker 3:          00:56:54       There is no single Copenhagen interpretation and arguably it's not an interpretation at all. So it's, the phrase of the Copenhagen interpretation is a little bit like the holy Roman Empire. You know, there's, there's no the, and there's no interpretation and the affiliation with Copenhagen is questionable. But, um, but if you, if you pick a version of Copenhagen, if you say, okay, let's pick the version that says quantum mechanics stops applying at a particular, you know, size scale, then the answer of what happens to the cat is reasonably clear. If it's larger than that size scale than the cat is either dead or alive. And if it's smaller than the cat is both dead and alive. If you pick a version of Copenhagen that says no, it's meaningless to ask about what happens to the cap before you look, then the answer is we can't say what happens to the cabinet until you look because it's meaningless because that's what we said because we don't understand philosophy of language or metaphysics because we didn't pay attention when the logical positivists were taken down in the mid 20th century.

Speaker 3:          00:57:49       Um, but I definitely, but then you can get an interference pattern of cats. I agree. Yeah. No, you can get an interference. The interference pattern is real. I can't defend it because they think it's not just wrong, but logically incoherent. Um, which makes it very, very difficult to be, you know, sympathetic. I have to pick a version of it. And as far as I can tell, the most reasonable version of Copenhagen, which some people at least did believe that some points is that there was some sort of split between the classical and the quantum. It happens either at some scale or when it hits the brain because the brain is somehow exempt from the laws of physics anyway. Yeah.

Speaker 7:          00:58:31       Like second under Tory question first. Yeah. Oh, okay. Um, freewill is bogus and the world is entirely deterministic. Does, does contradict quantum physics. What does it mean for there to be no causation?

Speaker 3:          00:58:46       Um, okay. So the question is about whether quantum physics is deterministic, uh, and, and what it or whether you know it, what it would mean for there to be no causation, whether quantum physics, it's deterministic, depends on your interpretation. Um, for example, the pilot wave interpretation is entirely deterministic. The many worlds interpretation is entirely deterministic, which is actually kind of a problem for it because you need to figure out where the probabilities come from in the pilot wave interpretation. They come from ignorance and the many worlds interpretation, you need to figure out why we don't know things because everything obeys this totally deterministic Schrodinger equation. Um, but there are people who work on that who thinks they found solutions to it. It's an active area of research. Um, nonetheless, that's totally deterministic. Um, there are proposed modifications to quantum mechanics that would also solve the measurement problem called spontaneous collapse theories. Those are fundamentally non-deterministic. So it depends on what you pick. Um, as for what it means for things to not be deterministic, it means that sometimes the future of the world is not fully specified by the past state of the world.

Speaker 9:          00:59:57       Uh, an effort to figure out the nature of the universe and how the universe works until or unless it can come up with some kind of device that can measure or detect that which energy and mass actually is. Because when you tear apart both mass and energy, eventually you're left with nothing. But obviously mass and energy must be coming from something. Do you think we'll ever come up with some means made up of mass or energy that can detect that which underlies mass and energy? Do you think that's ever possible?

Speaker 3:          01:00:32       Um, I think that math is just one form of energy. I wouldn't say that mass and energy are two sides of the same coin. I would say maths is just one kind of energy. And what's fundamental is energy. And that is the standard view among most physicists. And I think it's probably right, mass as it kind of energy the same way. Kinetic energy. Is it kind of energy the same way he does it kind of? Well, he doesn't kind of kinetic energy. Um, the same with the potential energy is a kind of energy. Um, I, I think that, um, what equals MC squared really says is that mass is form of energy. Um, so yeah, I, I, I don't see a problem there the way that you do. Okay. Yup. You, uh, let's go back to the story. What is consciousness? According to quantum physics, I don't see a relationship.

Speaker 3:          01:01:21       I, okay, let me be less flip. Um, so I think that a lot of people like to say that consciousness has some relationship to quantum physics because we don't fully understand what consciousness is and because there's controversy over the solution to the measurement problem. So if we put together the two things that we don't understand, maybe we'll get just one thing we don't understand. Um, and, and some serious physicists have at various points proposed that consciousness is the solution to the measurement problem. That it's consciousness that collapses wave functions. Uh, Eugene Vegner believe this at one point until he was set straight. Um, I, I don't think that that's correct. I think that if that is correct, we need to do a lot more work to prove that it's correct because there are definitely viable alternatives to that on the table. Um, I think that if consciousness causes collapse, we have questions like, okay, what is consciousness, uh, by what virtue is, does it cause collapse?

Speaker 3:          01:02:16       What property does it have that allows it to collapse wave functions? What else can collapse wave functions? It's, it's a whole host of other problems. Uh, and I don't think quantum physics itself says anything about the nature of consciousness. I think that that's, uh, what consciousness is, is a good question for a different field. So, so I remember reading like 30 years ago these books, uh, following up to that, the dancing really masters and the Dell of consciousness. And I think the whole premise of those books was what can cause a collapse in, in the, in these functions. Is that, is that basically the whole, that was the whole misconception of those books that they based their entire farm worker owned. The question was, um, and, and can I ask you a followup? Which is it, while you're, what, what does cause a collapse? What can cause a collapse in, in this funk?

Speaker 3:          01:03:04       Sure. Okay. So first I realized I'd never actually repeated the original question I just answered, which was what is consciousness according to quantum physics? That's the answer you just gave. Your question was these books, the dancing really masters, the Tao of physics, was this about a misunderstanding of what causes the collapse of the wave function and then what does cause the collapse of the wave function? I think that those books were, and did full disclaimer, I have not actually read both of those books from cover to cover. I flipped through them. But, um, I think that part of the deal with those books is that they are interested in going after these questions that were seen as verboten for physicists by the Copenhagen interpretation, which, you know, the shut up part of shut up and calculate has this sort of moralistic sense to it. Like not only should you not ask that, not only don't you need to ask these questions, you shouldn't ask these questions.

Speaker 3:          01:03:55       Good physicists, don't ask these questions. There's something wrong with you if you ask these questions. Um, which is bullshit. Um, but I think that these books were motivated in part by a desire to ask those questions and then they said, okay, and let's ask other questions that are verboten to physicists. Like, you know, is their ESP. What about, you know, telekinesis, you know, what about the relationship between religion and quantum physics consciousness and quantum physics. And I think, you know, throwing and all that stuff really confuses things. Um, but I think that they were right to ask the question of what's going on wave function, collapse. Um, I also think that they were motivated by this sort of desire to see similarities between certain religions and, you know, quantum physics. Uh, and just to, to talk about that for a second before I get to your last part of the question.

Speaker 3:          01:04:45       Um, I think it's generally a bad idea to try to find parallels between religion and science because science has this nasty habit of, you know, being refined and corrected and improve, you know, wrong or scientific theories get overturned. So if you try to latch your religious philosophy onto a particular scientific truth, there's a good chance that your religious philosophy is going to go down the toilet when that truth is found to be not quite true or completely wrong. Um, so I, I'm not very sympathetic to that project and I don't think that people who like religion should be either, um, anyway. Um, as for what actually causes the collapse of the wave function, I dunno, I don't even know if wave functions do collapse if they don't collapse. We live in many worlds or we have something like pilot wave theory where collapses not it's, it's something that's sort of relative to other stuff. It's, it's more complicated than that. Or we have something like a spontaneous collapse theory where collapse is a real objective thing that happens at random. Um, we're one of the other options so I don't know what causes it, but either wave function collapses happening or something is causing it to look like wave function collapses happening and figuring out what's going on. There is a legitimate area of scientific inquiry, uh, called foundations of quantum physics. Um, that still has a bad reputation among physicists. Even to this day though, it's less bad than it used to be.

Speaker 7:          01:06:10       You mentioned, um, I, I've heard you mentioned many times that um, there's sort of this big split between, um, physicists and philosophers of physics because physicists don't know any philosophy yup. While philosophers of physics, no, a lot of physics. Yes. Uh, I'm, I'm also thinking of, I think I'm probably going to misquote it, quote by, uh, I think it might be some modern philosopher, might be Dan Dennett. I Dunno who said something like, you know, there's no science without philosophy. There's only science wit unexamined philosophy or something like that, which I'll play something then it would say. And so I, I thought maybe you might want to comment on like, why is it that physicist during the, when he philosophy anymore, at least

Speaker 3:          01:06:57       there's a very good question. So the question is about why physicists mostly don't seem to know philosophy, but philosophers of physics, you know, the serious ones tend to be very well schooled in physics. Many of them have undergraduate or even PhDs in philosophy or in physics as well as philosophy. Um, yeah, there's definitely an asymmetry there where the philosophers know much more physics than the physicists know philosophy. Um, as a physicist, I'm interested in asymmetries. Um, so yeah, I think, uh, I think that, um, basically this is, this is due to a variety of historical and cultural factors. Um, I think that, I think that that quote, whether it's Dan Dennett or whoever who said that, uh, it's definitely true that physicists engage in philosophy all the time while doing philosophy or while doing physics. It's just part of it. Um, and, and then the question is, okay, you know, why don't they admit that?

Speaker 3:          01:07:58       Why don't they look at this? Well, philosophy has a bit of a bad reputation among physicists, so why does it have a bad reputation? That's a hard question to answer. I think part of it has to do with those same factors at work after World War II where academia and just got flooded with more people and this led to a sort of balkanization of academia and the walls kind of went up between departments. It used to be that physicists generally had some schooling in philosophy. Now that's not necessary. I'm not saying that, you know, we should go back to the good old days are plenty of problems, but I do think that a liberal arts education is quite valuable, uh, for doing almost anything. Um, but I think that due to that, you know, that sort of set of boundaries between academic disciplines that has made it easy for physicists to be ignorant of philosophy.

Speaker 3:          01:08:48       And then it's easy for misconceptions about philosophy. Like it doesn't make progress. They just asked the same questions over and over again. They're not like us physicists, you know, uh, that, that kind of thing to show up. Um, philosophers also have a habit of asking very annoying questions. This is a long and proud tradition going back to Socrates. Um, though most of us don't have to, you know, drink hemlock as a result. Um, but, uh, you know, one way of dismissing annoying questions is to say that the people who ask the knowing questions are stupid and don't need to be listened to, you know, or you make them drink hemlock. So, um, but that's, that's, that's another thing. Um, I think that there are some philosophers who are, let's say, skeptical of scientific progress. Um, this has to do with a split within philosophy between analytic and continental philosophy, which is a whole other thing.

Speaker 3:          01:09:42       And those names are incidentally not relevant at all to what those fields study. They're just historical artifacts. Um, but continental philosophy tends to, you know, um, be a little bit more skeptical of authority in any form and, and in many ways, rightly so. Uh, and it tends to ask questions about scientific authority, which if you interpret them naively or figure a bad continental philosopher can lead to people saying things like, Oh, science is just as good as any other way of, you know, trying to solve problems. And that's some bullshit and scientist who'd be rightly dismissive of that. And then they might lump all other philosophers and with that. But that's just a guess on my part. Um, so I think that basically philosophy has a very bad reputation for a variety of reasons. Um, it used to not, um, you know, uh, boarded, read too much content, but it's better than reading nothing.

Speaker 3:          01:10:36       Um, Einstein read a lot of Ma and Leiden. It's and, uh, and uh, Espinosa and other great philosophers. Hume in particular. Um, yeah, I think that, um, I think we have, it's a real shame that that asymmetry is there. I think that philosophers of physics have a lot to teach physicists and, and have a lot of value to offer. Um, and I think it's really awful when prominent scientists, um, say stupid things about philosophy, which happens more often than it should. So the next question is, what about the success of Quantum electrodynamics and predicting? Um, I mean, it seems like your answer is the past hour long talk, roughly. Yeah. So, so the, the, the success of quantum electrodynamics yeah, absolutely. Quantum electrodynamics and quantum field theories in general are extremely successful on not debating the success of quantum physics. It absolutely works. It's just an incomplete picture of what's going on in the world and throwing in quantum field theory as opposed to just, you know, Vanilla quantum mechanics doesn't fix the problem.

Speaker 3:          01:11:39       If anything, it makes it worse. You know, uh, some people will say, Oh, quantum field theory definitely gets you around bell's Theorem because quantum field theories designed to be compatible with special relativity. Uh, there are these things called the Comutation relations that, that sort of ensure this, um, relationship. Uh, no, that doesn't solve the problem at all because you still have the problem of wave function collapse in quantum field theory and that is subject to bell's Theorem and that does not get solved by the Comutation relations. And this is a massive misunderstanding that still persist among physicists. And that's just a mathematical mistake. That's just an error. Quantum field theory doesn't solve this problem. A quantum field theory also has other problems. It works incredibly well, but it also has its own unique issues, you know, that, that mathematicians worry about like renormalization or something called hugs theory in which don't get me started. Um, yeah. Uh, anyway, so yeah, I mean quantum field theory is great. I love it. Uh, it is a wonderful theory. It doesn't solve these problems. Okay. We have time for one more question. So I think since you haven't had time,

Speaker 10:         01:12:45       just follow up to your previous answer, um, s without speculating about why this is to have a bad image of philosophy. Can you, from your research pinpoint when this attitude, like when did [inaudible] start to have a bad image of philosophy and since you're a physicist and philosopher, yeah. Can you give us your attitude towards philosophy, noting that your answer doesn't need to be monolithic. Is there some part of philosophy that you think is, was worth worthwhile?

Speaker 3:          01:13:10       I don't know exactly when the split happened. I don't think it's something that happened all at once. I think that World War II has a lot to do with it, which is, you know, in a way kind of boring answer, you know, and like one of the central events of the 20th century had a lot of effects. You know, that's, that's a somewhat boring answer, but, um, but yeah, I mean we're, we're two really changed the way that academia works. It really moved the center of physics from Germany to the US, the US already habit tradition of much more pragmatic approaches to the sciences, um, which, you know, uh, that's going to make philosophy look yes, less useful. Um, there was also this school of thought called logical positivism, which was very influential in the first half of the 20th century. And then, uh, and it was also a school of thought, which was dismissive of certain kinds of philosophy.

Speaker 3:          01:14:01       And then around the time that physics and philosophy kind of decoupled around the end of World War Two, that was also the beginning of the decline of logical positivism, even among philosophers who were sympathetic to the aims of the positivists. And so by the time positivism was sort of fully discredited, um, this asis couldn't really get the memo and still use a lot of positivist aish arguments, really knockoff positivist arguments like, oh, it's meaningless to talk about things that you can't see. The, would use those arguments to dismiss most of philosophy when in fact philosophy is it, you know, decades old counter arguments explaining why that doesn't work. And when you present those to physicists, they will sort of the sort of stare at you slack jawed like, wow, how did you, you know, did you come up with that yourself? That seems very profound and think, know that argument is older than both of us combined.

Speaker 3:          01:14:54       Um, so, um, so yeah, as for my take on philosophy, I think that in general it is usually a bad idea to dismiss almost any area of serious academic inquiry. There are exceptions, um, such as, you know, evolutionary psychology. But, um, uh, but, but, uh, um, I like psychology, evolutionary psychology. Um, um, but, uh, but I think that most of philosophy has something worthwhile. I think philosophy of physics in, in the analytic tradition has done a lot of really great work in particular because it's gone after these questions that physicists have largely ignored. Um, but I also think that, you know, philosophy of science really helps to clear up a lot of misunderstandings that are prom, like prevalent among scientists of all stripes about how science works. There are some naive ideas there that philosophers have helped to sort of kick to the curb. Um, I think that, I think that if you think that you have a simple answer to a deep question talking to a philosopher for a few minutes, it will usually tell you that you're wrong.

Speaker 3:          01:16:11       And I think that, that it's good to experience being wrong. I think depends on an important part of the human experience. And I think that it's good to think deeply about strange questions. Um, and I think that the questions philosophers tend to ask, and this might be another sore like source of the problem, philosophers will ask questions that sound like they have obvious answers to scientists. Like, okay, you know, um, what is a physical law? Okay. You know that that doesn't seem interesting and it seems obvious. And then, you know, they go on about it for five minutes and I go, okay, you know, yeah, I see what they're asking, but I think there's an easy answer. And then they go on about it for 10 more minutes and you realize you don't even know where the hell you are anymore. Um, and I mean, I think that that's a really good experience to have.

Speaker 3:          01:16:56       I think it's good to understand, wait, these things that we take for granted might be way more complicated than we think. And there is also a long and proud tradition in science of doing science and damn the torpedoes, you know, forget, you know, the philosophical or mathematical foundations. I'm not even saying that shut up and calculate was always the wrong approach. It's certainly not the case that every single physicist should be thinking about quantum foundations all the time. It's just that moralistic thing of, no, you should shut up and calculate. A good physicist shuts up and calculates. That's some bullshit. You know, the, these questions are legitimate parts of science, and the boundary between science and philosophy is, and always has been permeable, um, just as it is between any two disciplines. And, um, yeah, it's been a pleasure and thank you, all of you for coming. Thank you.
