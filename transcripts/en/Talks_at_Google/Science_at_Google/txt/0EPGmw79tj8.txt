Speaker 1:          00:06          So I wrote a book called the ants. The world volcanic apocalypse is lethal oceans and our quest to understand earth's past mass extinctions, but just kind of a mouthful. But this talk and the book is about the science behind the worst mass extinctions and arts history. So just give you a little context for what we're talking about. Um, the earth is 4.5 billion years old. Um, and we're really only concerned with the last a half billion years or so. So kind of just recent history. Um, and the reason why we're only concerned about the last half billion years is because this is really the age of what we think of as complex life or animal life. Um, before this, um, some cool stuff does happen at the beginning. There's this thing called the late heavy bombardment where the earth just getting pelted by giant asteroids around 2.5 billion years ago. There's the great oxygenation event when suddenly auction becomes an appreciable part of the earth atmosphere and kind of underwrites all the complex life afterwards.

Speaker 1:          00:59          Um, right before the age of animal life, there's this crazy period of life on earth called snowball earth where the earth goes in and out of these sort of global glow [inaudible] glaciations that you know, froze the planet almost solid to the tropics. Um, on the other hand, from 1.8 billion years ago to 800 million years ago, there's a period that's so uneventful that it's called the boring billion, and it's called that by geologists. So that really says something. Um, so, um, much better visualization for this. I just want an excuse to show this picture because I love this picture. Um, but the, we're really talking about the top part of the spiral here when there's things like dinosaurs and a trial bites and fish and things like that and all those spirals back to the beginning as sort of the boring billions I was just making fun of.

Speaker 1:          01:42          But, so we'll zoom in on the last 500 million years. Um, there've been five times last 500 million years when more than 75% of life on earth goes extinct in what geologically is a brief period of time. So this is on the order of thousands to tens of thousands of years, which sounds like a long time to us, but geologically that is like an eye blink. So we'll just dive right in. The first one of these is 445 million years ago. It's the end Ordovician mass extinction. This is an still an unbelievably long time ago. This is hundreds of millions of years before dinosaurs or pangea or anything like that. Um, the, the planet would have looked completely alien and unrecognizable and here's some evidence for that. Um, so you can squint at this all day, but I don't expect you'll be able to really Orient Yourself. But just to help out a little bit, that one of these floating islands, the one that sort of, uh, to the west, that's North America, it's mostly south of the equator, rotated about 90 degrees and it's covered by his mostly underwater too.

Speaker 1:          02:39          Um, and sort of the earth is covered with a lot of these shallow seas. Um, and that there's this supercontinent that's slowly drifting over the south pole called Gun Twana, which is made up of Africa, South America, Australia, Antarctica, India, Saudi Arabia. Um, and interestingly, this little island chain that sort of down there, that's, I don't know if you could see it, but that's actually eastern New England and the Canadian maritimes that in about 70 million years is going to crash into North America. So this is a totally different planet. You'll see that the color of the continents is kind of this dull, grayish brown. And that's because, um, the on land was basically a barren wasteland. Uh, there's no trees, there's hardly any plants at all. The ones that do exist are sort of weeds around lake margins and stuff, but for the most part, if you went and visited the land in the Ordovician, it sort of, would it look like what you see from the Mars Curiosity rover?

Speaker 1:          03:32          It just would have been a desolate place. Um, but there is tons of animal life and it's under the, it's under the waves. Like I said, there's a lot of these shell of cs c levels are hundreds of feet taller than they are today. So the continents were flooded with these shallow seas. And this is a terrible picture that I took, but this is from Cincinnati. Um, and if you drive around Cincinnati, it's amazing. You, you see just this gray stratified rock. And if you go up and look at it, it's just filled with seashells and fossils. And this is from almost a half billion years ago. Um, this is one of the most fossil rich regions in the world. And it's one of the best examples of Ordovician sea life and the fossils you find her from things that look like this. So this is a painting of what life would have looked like in North America, um, in these shallow seas.

Speaker 1:          04:10          And so it's known as the sea without fish, which is something of an overstatement. There are fish, there's sort of these like jawless Weirdos. There's one right there in the foreground, but ecologically they're not that important. And the world is really dominated by things without backbones, invertebrates. So it's sort of like a world of creepy crawlies almost. Um, you have these things that look like horseshoe crabs, kind of trial bites. There's one of those. And then the, these big dominant predators are a cephalopod, not Deloitte or not allied cephalopods, which are kind of the squid, like things that are stuffed into these giant ice cream cones and they would have eaten trilobites and all sorts of other stuff. Um, so this is the Ordovician world. It's a very alien world. And at the end of the Ordovician, the shallow seas where a lot of these things, um, lived basically disappeared because you suddenly go into this huge ice age and the sea level drops by hundreds of feet.

Speaker 1:          04:59          You destroy all this habitat on top of the continents. Um, but even things in the deep go extinct. And that might be because the ice age changed the circulation of the ocean and change the oxygenation. And so you're destroying a lot of habitat, uh, thanksgiving, pretty bleak. Um, the reason why you go into an ice age, just thoughts that CO2 was sort of dwindling over the Ordovician. I'm to the point where when it reached this threshold where then you go into this huge ice age, uh, today we're worried about Sia to going up too fast and getting really warm. But I've thought opposite thing happens. You know, it can get very cold. Um, the reasons why CO2 is declining or debated. But one of the ideas is that you can't really see it here, but the Appalachians are starting to form. Um, they would have been this huge volcanic mountain range in the tropics that would've been eroding really fast.

Speaker 1:          05:47          And for some reasons we don't have to get into. That'd be a really good way of sequestering. A lot of Sio two. So this is kind of a weird extinction. It doesn't really have much to do with the other ones. Um, so then we'll just jump forward this about 70 million years to the late Devonian mass extinction when three quarters of life goes extinct. The Devonian is an interesting time because it's actually, there's a period of about 15 to 20 million years where you have just pulses of extinction where the ocean seems to keep losing it's oxygen for some reason. Um, but so as I said, it's a really, it's a, it's also a really transitional period for life on earth. As I said before in the Ordovician, there wasn't much plant life. There were no trees in the Devonian. Suddenly plant life is sort of taking off.

Speaker 1:          06:29          Trees suddenly evolve and they're sort of invading the continence. Interestingly, the first fossil trees or forest that we know of on the planet were found in upstate New York. Uh, when they acquiring a dam to make a New York City reservoir, it's this thing called the Gilboa fossil forest. But today you can't go there because it's behind the protection of the State Department of environmental protection. So it's kind of a bummer. But, um, the motivation was the seat without fish. By the late Devonian renown this period called the age of fishes. There's this huge array of really bizarre fishes. Um, this thing is a plaque dorm, which there are other platforms that look totally different, but this one was sort of the top predator. It had this sort of guillotine like mouth, kind of a crazy scary animal. These things have actually been invoked for why our fish ancestors decided to come onto land.

Speaker 1:          07:16          Basically they are terrified of things that look like this. Um, and then so also in the oceans you have the largest coral reefs in the history of life on earth, they would have been 10 times the extent of modern coral reefs. And in the late Devonian extinction, um, 99.99% of them disappear. These things get hammered. Um, it's a really bleak time and like I said, an Oxi or the ocean losing its oxygen is thought to be one of the big kill mechanisms for this extinction. And it's a similar thing happens in our world today. Um, so I don't know if you guys saw this, but earlier this summer, the largest dead zone ever and the Gulf of Mexico was measured. Um, this is sort of a seasonal phenomenon in the summer when, um, the Gulf of Mexico basically loses oxygen over a huge area and it's horrible for fishermen.

Speaker 1:          08:02          Uh, you have these sort of tides wash and all these dead fish and the Gulf coast. Um, and the reason why this happens is because in the middle of the country, when we spread in industrial agriculture, when we spread fertilizer on our crops, rich in nitrogen and phosphorous, it washes into the Mississippi and then out into the Gulf of Mexico where it fuels these huge plankton blooms that when they die, they take up all the oxygen in the water and sort of kill everything else. Um, so something like this is going on in the Devonian, um, only on a much larger scale. And since there is no industrial agriculture that we know of going on the Devonian, um, one of the, uh, reasons invoked for this is actually that it might've been the trees themselves, which is, it's kind of interesting that one of the things trees do is they, they break down rock, um, and they create soils and when you have trees just suddenly invade in the continents, they would in breaking down a ton of creating a ton of soils and sort of liberating all these things like phosphorus that we sprayed on our crops a day would have washed into rivers and then out into the oceans and might've caused these huge anoxic events.

Speaker 1:          09:05          Um, and when notions went and Auc sec and all these things died, they fell to the bottom of the ocean and over hundreds of millions years became black shale. And this is actually the stuff we fracked today. This is from Lake Erie. There's exposures to some of this black shale, but a lot of the stuff that we've been fracking in the last few years is sort of dead sea life from the Devonian mass extinctions, which is kind of interesting. And actually the extinction itself is in this picture. It's, well it's, it's in there, but it's one of those boundaries. Okay. So more than a hundred million years later, we have the end Permian mass extinction. This is the worst thing that has ever happened in the history of life on earth. This is kind of the all is lost moment for planet earth. Um, something like 90 to 96% of species go extinct. Uh, coral reefs have recovered at this point, but at the end Permian, they are totally destroyed and basically replaced by bacterial slime of the sort that you don't really see in the fossil record since before there was animal life.

Speaker 1:          10:01          But suddenly it kind of shows up all over the place in the Permian. Um, in the fossil record, you see things like, um, there's sort of these weird things that look like fungal spores right at the extinction all over the planet. And people have said that maybe this is sort of a signature of things just like rotting everywhere. Um, co trees disappear from the fossil record for we can't find them for maybe 10 million years after this. It's incredibly bleak. Um, and so, but this is the setting that it took place and we are now in Pangea, which, um, I'm sure some of you have heard of. It's his time when all the continents were United in sort of this big sea, um, shaped thing. And so North America is attached to Africa and their stuff. America and Asia is kind of up there. You can see it's kind of deserty and bleak and some parts.

Speaker 1:          10:47          And in the continental interior of Pangea might've gotten really extreme. There's evidence from Kansas that parts of the interior of the continent was like 160 degree degrees Fahrenheit or something like that. But there are places where life is happy and at the end of the primary we have this sort of happy ecosystem that doesn't know that the end of the world is coming. But, um, on land, the top Predator are things that look like this. This is a cool artist representation of a therapsid, um, which was sort of the, uh, uh, Predator lineage of this larger group of animals called synapses. So these also some of these look like bigs, rhinoceros sort of things with tusks. And um, there were also these big warty reptiles. And this picture actually makes this guy look kind of cool, but you look at other representations of animals from this period and it does, it's not really the most photogenic time for planet earth.

Speaker 1:          11:34          Um, and then in the oceans, this is a picture of the ocean from the Permian. This is the Guadalupe mountain range in West Texas. Um, which if you hike it and you look at the rocks you're stepping on, you can see that it's basically just made out of a giant reef. The whole thing is basically fossils. Um, and it gives one of the best examples of what life was like in the oceans, in the Permian. And if you go to the Permian Basin Petroleum Museum in Midland, Texas, like I did, uh, you can see this cool display of what these reefs would have looked like. Um, and cause see, life was very happy in Texas, in the Permian. Uh, eventually that died and was buried and much later made some people very rich and powerful. And in the Permian Basin Petroleum Museum has a hall of fame there. Then includes two of our presidents, which is kind of cool.

Speaker 1:          12:21          Um, anyways, uh, so for a long time people want it to, I mean obviously people were wanting, we're curious why did earth almost go extinct at the Permian? And, um, knowing that a huge asteroid is associated with the later extinction of the dinosaurs, which I'll get to, um, geologists aware of that came to this extinction other early extinctions looking for evidence of asteroid impacts in the fossil record. Things like, um, you know, a crater big enough to account for all the devastation or a layer of asteroid dust and the false record and they couldn't find it, um, which came as kind of a surprise. And, but what they did find is that this huge area of Russia that's outlined here, um, is known as the Siberian traps. And it's basically all entirely made out of ancient lava. And when it was dated, it dates precisely to the Permian mass extinction.

Speaker 1:          13:11          Here's actually a picture from, from you guys of what this area looks like. And you can see the sort of dull brown sort of stuff is basically just the ancient lava. Um, and if you go there, which I haven't, but this is what it looks like. It's just kind of these sweeping plateaus of ancient lava. Enough lava erupted at the end of the Permian that it could have covered the lower 48 United States a kilometer deep, um, which is just mind blowing. Um, people talk about Yellowstone is sort of this apocalyptic thing, but if yellow stone went off, it would cover, um, a few states and a few inches of ash. Enough lava here erupted to cover the whole United States a kilometer deep. So this really is a truly outrageous event. Um, this might be something what it looked like. These are fissure eruptions, um, but since as extreme as it was, it really only covered part of Russia.

Speaker 1:          14:03          So that can really explain why almost everything on the planet goes extinct, even if it's on the other side of the world. And so with geologist actually think that it was the gasses that came out of these volcanoes, that where the the kill mechanism for most life on earth and the most important of those gases would have been, or it's argued, would have been carbon dioxide. Uh, we know the volcano's would've been capable of producing incredible amounts of carbon dioxide and you can see signatures of that and the rocks and it gets incredibly hot. Uh, at the mass extinction when paleontologist told me that oceans in the tropics would have been the temperature of hot soup, um, and when, uh, sea water reacts with the Carbon Dioxide, it makes it more acidic and it makes it harder for things that calcify there, like build their skeletons to stick around.

Speaker 1:          14:47          And so a carbon ocean acidification is thought to be a major kill mechanism in this mass extinction too. So those reefs I showed you totally disappear. Um, this guy totally disappears. Um, interestingly, he is on our side of the family tree. If these things are called mammal like reptiles, so something in this and this branch eventually becomes mammals. Um, but these, these guys all get wiped out. Uh, but our, our ancestor must've made it through, or else we wouldn't be here. And it might have looked something like this weaselly little guy called Thrinaxodon, which somehow makes it through this extinction. So that's the end Permian. Um, amazingly and the next, you know, tens of millions of years, life recovers and there's 25 million years later. Dinosaurs evolve. True mammals come around, a crocodile ancestors come around and coral reefs bounce back, but then 50 million years later, basically the exact same thing happens at the end Triassic.

Speaker 1:          15:42          Um, 80% of species go extinct. And it's basically the same thing, just sort of a mini version of the end. Permian. There's a, the earth sort of opens up and there's another one of these crazy volcanic events. So this is the slide for the Permian, but the world wouldn't have looked that much different except for the fact that North America would have started to be pulling away from Africa. And you would get this, uh, system of riff valley lakes there. And here's a picture of one. This is in Connecticut actually, uh, about 210 million years ago. And you could see they're dinosaurs now. Um, but dinosaurs actually are not the dominant animal on in the world this point. Um, it's actually this branch of crocodile relative, so you can see, you can see one of them here and some of them would have looked like things would recognize as crocodiles, but some of these animals are really strange somewhere.

Speaker 1:          16:26          Um, plant eaters that ran around on two legs. And so there's this whole kind of weird world of crocodiles, relatives. Here's one called the Carolina butcher that they found a year or two ago outside of Raleigh, North Carolina. Um, so you can see how these things sort of would have been the dominant animal on the planet and the dinosaurs really needed these things to get wiped out in a mass extinction to take over. And the next stage, so this is, this is another picture of the ocean. Uh, this is the Australian Alps, which are almost, or which are in large part made out of coral reefs from the Triassic modern core Reese evolve and sort of have this huge blossoming but then are totally wiped out in the mass extinction. You can't really find corals for hundreds of thousands to millions of years after this extinction. Um, and so for a lot, for a decade or two ago, people thought they knew what sort of, um, killed everything.

Speaker 1:          17:14          And it is, it was this crater that's in Quebec, which is about 62 miles wide. This is another picture I took from Google maps. If you just go sort of a little northwest of Maine over the Saint Lawrence River, you'll find this giant circular system of lakes. Um, and people knew it was around the time of the extinction. The problem is the Triassic mass extinction. It was 201 million years old or years ago. And when they did this, they found it was 214 million years old. So this kind of came as a surprise because it seems like this massive asteroid hit that had been calculated should kill at least a third of life on earth struck during a period when it seems like life was pretty happy and not at the time of the mass extinction. So at this kind of came as a surprise to geologists who, um, it sort of made them rethink just how deadly asteroids have been in earth history.

Speaker 1:          18:00          Uh, this is a picture from on top of what actually was the kill mechanism of the entrust mass extinction. So that's us in the background, but this picture is from on top of the New Jersey Palisades, um, just over the George Washington Bridge and the New Jersey Palisades are just like the Siberian traps, this huge expanse of ancient magma. Um, these would have been underground, but they would have been feeding eruptions and New Jersey to the west. But you can find the same rock data to the exact same time in Nova Scotia, Brazil, Spain, Morocco, and it all comes out right at the, at the traffic mass extinctions. So it's another one of these insane volcanic events, um, would have covered 3 million square miles and lava. But again, it's thought that these gasses that came out of it really did the did in life 135 million years later. We have the most famous mass extinction ever.

Speaker 1:          18:52          Um, this, the end Cretaceous is the one that everyone's familiar with, uh, 66 million years ago. Um, all the non bird dinosaurs go extinct. Um, we still have bird dinosaurs around. Um, but all these iconic species that people know about, like t rex and triceratops, all are, are, are there at doomsday and sort of all the big dinosaurs go extinct, but it's not just dinosaurs. There's tons of other cool stuff on the planet that goes extinct. This is actually also the biggest mass extinction in the history of mammals. Um, they, they make it through, but it also, nothing really escapes the, the sort of sky of extinction here, um, in the ocean. Uh, these, this, this, uh, artist rendition of an ammonite, things like this had been swimming in the ocean for 300 million years and all of them disappear at this extinction. Um, we also have these sort of giant terrifying marine reptiles.

Speaker 1:          19:45          It's like a, this is a picture of a Mosasaur skeleton. People think of these as sort of aquatic dinosaurs, but these were evolved on a different lineage. They evolved out of things that look like monitor lizards or snakes. Um, and similarly you have pterosaurs these crazy giant flying reptiles that also aren't dinosaurs, but you can see here some of them got to be the size of like small plants. Um, and those all go extinct too. So lots of cool stuff goes extinct. This extinction I think has produced the best Paleo are in my opinion. Um, this is a painting of a t rex literally staring down the asteroid, um, which is pretty epic. And I'm in this picture you see some Pterosaurus flying by what must be the Yucatan peninsula. Um, but this, this, uh, this painting might actually, this might have actually sort of been an impossible seen cause I asked an impact modeler, uh, what it would've looked like if you had seen the impact.

Speaker 1:          20:37          And he said that the question didn't really make sense because if you're close enough to see the impact, you'd be dead instantly. Basically, he'd just be set on fire and you go blind. There's so much energy released in optical wavelength. So it was a really pretty extreme event. And they're, the reason why we know there was an asteroid impact is that in 1980, uh, Walter Alvarez and his dad, Louis Alvarez at UC Berkeley announced in a paper that they had found essentially a layer of asteroid dust between more or less the layers between the age of dinosaurs in age of mammals. And then a decade or so later, a paleontologist identified this hundred 10 mile crater in the Yucatan peninsula. That's, um, it's underground. So it's that, which is why it evaded them for so long. But it was actually founder first in the 70s by geophysicists working for a Mexican oil company.

Speaker 1:          21:25          Um, but it, and it was found a thousand years earlier, interestingly by Mayan civilization sort of unwittingly because, um, the impact structure has actually created all these limestone sinkholes that provide fresh water. And when mind civilization sort of sprouted up around this, uh, these freshwater sinkholes and unwittingly sort of created this hundred 10 mile ring that marks the asteroid crater that killed the dinosaurs. Uh, I visited Mexico and that's called the Chicxulub crater because the epicenter is this coastal town called chicks Solu. I'm on the Yucatan peninsula. Um, and I went there and I would argue this is the most important event in the last a hundred billion years. And this is the only memorial to it, which is kind of sad. Um, the fly in the ointment of the asteroid, uh, explanation for this mass extinction is that at the exact same time on the other side of the world in western India, you have another one of these completely, uh, crazy volcanic events of continental flood basalt where this time enough lava erupted to cover the lower 48 states in 600 feet deep, a lava.

Speaker 1:          22:29          So not quite. The Siberian traps was still a crazy amount of lava. And then in the last few years, as people have gone back to date this law, the, the Deccan traps they're called, um, the most voluminous period of the eruption seems to be closer and closer to the exact time of that mass extinction. So it's been really interesting to watch the last few years as these sorta two communities that have always worried about whether the relative importance of the asteroid impact versus the volcanoes have sort of this more complex holistic picture of, um, sort of a ecosystem going on for all sorts of horrible reasons, um, is emerging. And so just to recap, uh, we know a giant asteroid hit at the end of the Cretaceous for one of these mass extinctions as far as we can tell, we can't find evidence of a major impact at the end Triassic the end Permian, late Devonian or the endo division.

Speaker 1:          23:20          On the other hand, um, there are major asteroid impacts of time when Earth seems relatively happy. Uh, and then we do know that there were major volcanic events at the end, Triassic and Permian. I didn't mention it, but, uh, there is, uh, another one of these big volcanic provinces that's been dated sometime around the late Devonian mass extinction. Um, it hasn't been data precisely, but it's close enough to sort of certainly raise eyebrows. And then crazily enough, there's also one at the end. Cretaceous. So this seems like these, this seems to be a theme of mass extinctions and then we have an ice age and, and Ordovician and some weird stuff going on with trees in the late Devonian. To summarize, these volcanoes would have brought their destruction by extreme global warming. Uh, I don't expect anyone to understand this, but if you go to geology conferences, you'll see slides like this lot where people have analyzed limestones and you could tell it from the oxygen isotopes that it gets incredibly warm.

Speaker 1:          24:13          And you can tell from the carbon I still ups that there's a huge injection of like carbon that's driving the warming. Um, so this is for the Permian. It's pretty unintelligible, but so there's evidence of extreme global warming driven by Sia too and ocean acidification and ocean anoxia, um, which we see today or thoughts thought to be major kill mechanisms and these mass extinctions. Um, and this is concerning because modern notions of become 30% more acidic since the industrial revolution, uh, this is already affecting a shellfish. Growers in the Pacific northwest are having trouble growing oysters around Antarctica. And also in the Pacific northwest, you see certain types of plankton are starting to dissolve because the water's becoming more acidic. There's less carbonate to build their skeletons. And by the end of the century, if we do anything like business as usual emissions, this stuff's gonna get really grizzly with coal research, expect it to basically disappear by the end of the century.

Speaker 1:          25:07          And Anoxia, which is a major kill mechanism as I explained in the Devonian, is also spreading a modern notions from nutrient pollution from agriculture, but also warming makes it worse. Um, so as I said, Arianna sixth mass extinction, this is the question that people are talking about now. And I would say if we are in one, then it started a long time ago. Uh, there's sort of this eerie shadow that's followed humans as they enter Luton, new land masses over the last few tens of thousands of years, um, where all the large animal sorta go extinct, uh, where they are. So 50 to 60,000 years ago, people showed up in Australia and shortly thereafter you lose everything over a hundred kilograms, you lose these giant wombats that would have been the size of cows and a marsupial lions and monitor lizards that would have been 15 to 20 feet long. Um, and then 12,000 years ago around, um, we lose all red rom and humans are showing up in North America.

Speaker 1:          25:59          We lose all of what we think of as I sage fauna, things like woolly mammoths, mastodons, camels ground, sloths, all sorts of crazy stuff. And then right up to the present day and the past few centuries is people have made these epic voyages across the Pacific to tiny islands. They've, um, uh, you know, you lose these big flightless birds and land snails. And I switched stuff too. Now modern industrial society, we're really kind of our foot on the gas. Um, it's a picture of an industry or a shrimp fishing boat, but, um, industrial fishing. Every year we bought trawl basically just plow over an area, the sea floor, twice the size of the continental us. And there's a picture of a shrimp, what trim boats typically pull up, which is 90% of the stuff they pull up isn't shrimp. They, it's called bycatch, which is just other fish and sea turtles and stuff and they pull out the shrimp.

Speaker 1:          26:49          So there's huge wastes in our, in our fishing techniques today. And we also deforest a ton of stuff. This is a satellite picture of the Amazon merger sort of made in roads and are breaking up habitat and things like that. So, so far our interacts with the environment to the extent that it's been negative has really been through direct interaction. It's been through hunting and destroying habitat and things like that. And I think if we just sort of relented and let nature sort of go back, um, it nature, nature is incredibly resilient. I think a lot of these ecosystems would bounce back and, um, we could avoid sort of the worst. The problem is that in the next few centuries or next few decades to centuries, um, we're really going to start messing with the chemistry of the oceans and the atmosphere in a way that has only really happened a few times in the history of the planet.

Speaker 1:          27:35          And when it has, it's been really pretty devastating. So this is what a healthy coral reef looks like. Um, but based on just sort of business as usual and even some aggressive, uh, CO2 reduction scenarios, ocean acidification is thought to destroy most coral reefs the second half of this century. Um, so this is what a high CO2, slightly warmer ocean looks like. This is probably what coral reefs looked like at the end of the Permian. As one ecologists put it, we're on a slippery slope to slime. Um, so that's, that's all the bad news and that it can seem pretty overwhelming and pretty depressing. The good news is that we still have tons of biodiversity to save. So earlier I said it, it might be debatable whether we're in a sixth mass extinction. And the reason is that so far our best estimates is that less than 1% of species have gone extinct in the last few hundred years.

Speaker 1:          28:27          Um, so when you compare that to an event like the permanent, when it's 90, 96%, clearly we have a long way to go until we're in the same conversation as these worst events of all time. Uh, the bad news is that a lot of these animals, their populations are declining and the range sizes are declining. And that's sort of the first step to extinction. And the best paper on this is by a paleontologist at UC Berkeley, Anthony Barnosky. Um, it's called, has this earth six mass extinction arrived yet? And his calculation was that if we keep up our influence on the environment for a few more centuries to millennia, we could actually be in the same conversation as um, to five worse mass extinctions of all time. So I think the good news is that the world hasn't ended yet and we can still save it. And we still have time to do so, but we really have to act quickly.

Speaker 1:          29:16          And it's crazy that we could ever even be in the same conversation as these completely crazy events when, um, you know, and that giant asteroids hitting the same time as India is getting buried in lab and stuff. The fact they were even the same conversation, it's kind of amazing. Um, there's reasons to get discouraged based on sort of our political climate now. But I would, I would just say that it hasn't always been the case that conservation and environmentalism and kind of stewardship the environment has been a partisan issue. Um, completely. Uh, I'd just like to remind people that as recently as the George W. Bush administration, this is a picture of his, him signing a Mac to protect the northwest Hawaiian islands. And at the time this was the largest marine protected area in the world. And hopefully we can start to, I don't know, think across party lines and agree that we're all here and share the same planet and that we should, we should, uh, do our best to do so. Um, so are we in the sixth mass extinction yet? I would say we don't have to be, and there's still time to save the world. So let's go out and do that. And just to finish, here's a cool picture in New Mexico and at that, thank you Google.

Speaker 2:          30:27          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          30:31          oh, we're just going to kick off with a few questions and I'll open it up to you all. Um, so wow. Interesting stuff. And I like how you have some hope there, which is great. There's still time. So tell me, what was your initial inspiration for this book? I mean, what, what started the appeal to investigate all this? Well, there were a couple of things. One was sort of just like any kid, I loved Jurassic Park and stuff like that. And I've, I've always been obsessed with dinosaurs and I've made a point to keep in touch, keep in touch with the extinction literature in my whole life. So I've read, Walter Alvarez wrote a book called t rocks and the crater of doom. And then, uh, this other paleontologist Peter Ward wrote a book called under green sky. Um, and that was kind of the first time I'd heard that carbon dioxide might be involved with some of these other mass extinctions.

Speaker 1:          31:18          But, um, I was also writing a lot about the oceans and when you write about the oceans, as you can see there at the end, it can get pretty depressing. Um, and then I, I started to learn the story from a geologists that some of the changes that we're seeing today have actually happened in our sister each. Um, which to me was fascinating because you kind of hear the story of climate change and what we're doing to the planet as something that's sort of simulated on computer models. And I thought this was so cool that, um, the earth's kind of run this experiment and sort of extreme ways, um, and we can actually just go back and consult earth history to find out, uh, what happened. Um, and I also thought there was this sort of unknown or not it had been told, but I felt like the, the message could use some amplification, which is that in the public imagination, people associate mass extinctions with asteroids.

Speaker 1:          32:06          That's partly because right after that crater was discovered movies, horrible movies like Armageddon and deep impact came out. And so for most people they kind of left it there and they think, okay, mass extinctions are what happened when asteroids hit. And I had noticed that this cool conversation was going on in the geology community over the last few decades where we weren't able to find asteroids at the other mass extinctions. And it's actually some of the same mechanisms, um, in operation on the planet today or what, what caused them. And so I thought there sort of a news hook and it's also just fun to write about and volcanoes

Speaker 3:          32:40          and stuff like that. Nice. And thanks for speeding up time and taking us through the five mass extinction of those. Do you have a favorite

Speaker 1:          32:50          that changes? It kind of changes a lot, especially when I was writing the book. Every, every new extinction I would really focus on. I was like, this is the most mind blowing thing I've ever read. Um, it might be the might be the Permian I guess just cause it was so extreme. Um, and it's, I guess it's kind of, it's not really out there in the popular imagination, um, the way it should be just cause it, it's really what happens when you turn all the dials up to their maximum level and try as hard as you can to kill everything on the planet. Um, so I dunno, it's also, it might be too extreme of a, it's kind of good news because even with the Permian, which I don't know if we're capable of reproducing, even if we do our worst, um, one paleontologist told me I was the best thing that's ever happened on earth because 20 million years later you have dinosaurs and mammals and stuff like that and sort of this new world blossoms afterwards. So for me it was kind of amazing to sort of learn how resilient the planet is. Um, so yeah, I guess,

Speaker 3:          33:58          I guess the primary, and when people say, so what killed the dinosaurs? I've heard you say they're not dead. Tell us about that.

Speaker 1:          34:06          Yeah. So, as I said in the talk that the bird dinosaurs are still around and that's not a, that's not just something cute that paleontologists say like birds are literally dinosaurs. If you look at a skeleton of a, um, like a t rex and a chicken compared to a t rex stegosaurus, you can see that the first two are way closer, closer cousins. Then the latter two. Um, and even like if you have a chicken wing, you can see there's this little claw that comes up, call the, I think it's called a Lula or something, but there's actually still dinosaur clause and that's its thumb from a dinosaur claw that eventually sort of evolved to become a wing. So when you look at a chicken and a chicken's eyes, you can tell it has this sort of like cold Ref Tilian hello? So I don't, I don't, I think it's kind of obvious that they're dinosaurs. That's great. All right, well

Speaker 3:          34:53          we want to open it up to the audience. I'm sure the rest of the, uh, Googlers have some questions. One thing that I was hoping you can touch a little bit on is towards the end of the book you talk about, um, when you start talking about humans and like the current state, you talk about how humans have culture and that's kind of what's tied into like why were so destructive. The idea of like propagating information in ways of like, I guess going about like destroying things in the earth. And I was wondering if you can touch

Speaker 1:          35:23          yeah. And that, um, so a lot of people, a lot of times people ask me like, so when are humans going extinct? And, um, a lot of paleontologists would tell you that humans are incredibly existing, extinction resistant. Um, and that's because we have culture, um, where other animal sort of have to wait around for natural selection to kill them off. Um, and their information is sort of pass through to the next generation haphazardly by whichever part of the population is suited to the new environment. Humans can adapt on the fly by transmitting information through language and through books and things like that. And, uh, we can kind of get one step ahead of evolution. So that has enabled us to rapidly take over the planet and, uh, cure diseases and all these things that would have like, we don't get killed by lions that much anymore. Uh, all these things that would sort of take out other animals we can adapt to on the fly because we have this incredibly, uh, adaptive, malleable information transmission system that is much more powerful. You could argue the natural selection. So I don't know if that's right.

Speaker 4:          36:35          Um, hi. Um, in recent years we learned about the, that we broke the limit of Sio two in the atmosphere, the 400 parts per million. Yeah. And it's considered kind of like a brake line and that it may lead to what is called a cascade effect by the defrosting of Siberia and more methane being released and so on and so forth. Is that actually your deadline is, or are we going to see something like that in the next coming years?

Speaker 1:          37:06          So I know there, there has been this fear for a long time that we could destabilize these huge reservoir is a methane and kickoff this like completely catastrophic warming. Um, within a few decades. I think the more people have looked into that, it doesn't seem like these huge reserves are capable of sort of a catastrophic destabilization, but certainly over thousands of years, um, the earth is going to get a lot more warmer than it is today. Uh, we know that the main driver of climate for the last 60 million years or so is the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide. And the last time it was 400 parts per million was the, I think it was apply a scene. Um, but we're expected when sea level was, I dunno, it's like 30 meters or something higher than us today. Uh, so over thousands of years, ice is going to keep melting and sea level's going to go up and we're going to transition to this much warmer world.

Speaker 1:          38:00          Um, whether or not it will take place on a short enough time scale that'll be catastrophic to civilization, I think is still an open question. Um, but we're headed towards, people talk about, it could be five degrees warmer, um, by the end of the century and you think, okay, five degrees, if that's not that big of a deal last time it's five degrees warmer. There was no ice on Antarctica. Um, or at least in times of the past when it's been five degrees warmer, there's no ice in Antarctica and we're talking about going over a hundred parts per million co two. And that brings you back to like the eoscene when there were um, palm trees in Alaska and stuff like that. And so maybe in a few centuries to millennia we might actually recreate that world, but I think the next few centuries, or I mean the next few decades there's going to be, it'll get warmer and sea level go up. But I don't know if it would be quite on a catastrophic. I mean it will be, it could be, it will be catastrophic, but Antarctica is not going to melt completely tomorrow.

Speaker 4:          38:59          Thank you. It was wondering, so if 86 or 90% of animals go extinct, so it's not 100%. So what are the retreats for those little creatures then kind of survive? Did they settle on mountain top? So where did they go?

Speaker 1:          39:14          Yeah, so there's these theorize things called Refugia, um, where animals sort of waited out until conditions get better and then they can flourish scan. But that's sort of just a, a name that we've given to a phenomenon we don't understand quite, it's sort of like dark matter. It's like a placeholder because for the most part we don't really know where the Refugio are, but it's easy to make life really miserable in certain parts of the planet, but it's very hard to wipe out everything and every deep sea canyon and Mountain Valley everywhere on the planet of every size. And it's really hard to, to wipe out all of life on earth. It seems based on these mass extinctions.

Speaker 3:          39:52          I think it's in one of the freakonomics books, they talk about the scientists who, um, found that volcano eruptions bring down the amount of co two in the atmosphere and like serve to kind of cool the planet. There was this group of people who are trying to make like these artificial volcanic eruptions in Antarctica. And so how do you reconcile that with what you're saying before when you have these huge volcanic eruptions that brings so much co two into the atmosphere and leaning to extreme heating? Right.

Speaker 1:          40:21          So that's a good question because there's probably, people use the word super volcano at tuns tends to mean a few different things. Um, but yeah, explosive, uh, sort of strata volcanoes that we see around the planet today inject a lot of software aerosols that dim them, reduce the amount of sunlight that can come into the atmosphere and it makes it cooler temporarily. And that might have been a component. There might've been short term cooling and some of these mass extinctions. Um, we don't see any evidence of that in the fossil record and it seems to be swamped by it this thousands and thousands of years of extreme warming, but there might have been sort of cold snaps and things like that. What you're talking about with the Geo engineering by shooting sulfur sulfate, aerosols and to this guy. Um, so there's some scary studies on that that if for any reason we'd have to, if we started doing that, we'd have to keep doing it basically forever.

Speaker 1:          41:14          Um, because if you stop after a couple of years, the, the sulfur rains out and people who have modeled this, then in the meantime, if you keep building up carbon emissions while you're managing it by reducing the amount of sunlight, if that's stuff rains out, suddenly warming spikes like, and just a few years, you can jump up for like four degrees or something like that. And that would be totally catastrophic. So when we're planning on how we're going to address warming, I'm not a huge fan of, uh, that kind of geoengineering because it relies on, um, sort of global international agreements that are perfectly enforced forever. And based on, you know, I don't know, recent global geopolitics that prospect kind of frightens me, but that could have been a killing mechanism in the, in these extinctions too, is that you have the sulfate aerosols that are blocking sunlight at the same time. You're building carbon. And then when it gets rained out, suddenly have these huge warming spikes. So maybe we shouldn't try and recreate these like mass extinction, I guess. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          42:19          Hi. Um, so you talked about how these media or events, um, occasionally do, but also do not correlate with mass extinctions, but there's a, there's a greater correlation with these, uh, you know, apocalyptic lava flows. Uh, are there examples of times where there've been huge lava events that haven't affected life on earth or at least not to the same extent. And in general, what, um, what causes these, you know, huge lava events and, and how do they work?

Speaker 1:          42:49          Uh, that's a great question. And um, yeah, I didn't want to overcomplicate things, but there is one, there's one, I think it's a 130 million years ago or so called the prawn, the eights and Decca traps in South America that are maybe as big as the ones associated with the mass extinctions. And it similar lately, it doesn't seem like anything goes extinct. People have argued that maybe that's because it was over a longer time period or maybe it was based on the rocks that they were going coming through. Um, so that the Siberian traps we also know would have burned through the one of the world's largest coal basins and what burned through all these carbon rich rocks. And that would have been another way of getting a ton of co two in the air. And maybe if you're, if you're coming up through rocket isn't quite as filled with as many volatiles, then a, you can't quite get to a mass extinction.

Speaker 1:          43:41          Um, but that's definitely a definitely an active area of inquiry as to what causes them that starts to get into some really deep like geophysical questions. Uh, but there's sort of these theories, these things called mantle plumes, which are just, you know, the mantles convicting. And then every once in a while you get this like big blue, like plastic blog that just emerges, um, just rocketing to the surface. Um, I know in the Triassic they think that one of the sort of factors that might've made it easier for one of these things to happen is that as the continents are pulling apart, that the crust would have been weaker. And it might've been a weak spot for one of these things to break through to the surface and be as catastrophic as it is. But yeah, why they happen, I don't really get into the book and I kind of just paper over that. But yeah, mantle plumes, I guess.

Speaker 2:          44:36          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          44:37          Although those stellar theoretical, that's just, people have modeled things like that, but no one has ever, I don't think really founded direct evidence of mental loans right now though. I might get in trouble for saying this stuff because everything in the book, I'm interviewing geologists and things, I'm a science journalist, so for me to have an opinion about this stuff is I'm a little out of my depth and doing so, but, um, I'm reporting what, what I take from these geological meetings and these interviews and reading these books. So,

Speaker 2:          45:06          okay.

Speaker 1:          45:06          Thank you.
