Speaker 1:          00:00:05       Welcome everyone. Good afternoon. Oh, welcome to another exciting talks at Google event. And this is the second in our ongoing series of speakers from us that work with Stanford's Center for the advanced study in the behavioral sciences. And so today we're very thrilled to host Eric Klinenberg. He's back to the toxic Google program. Having Spoken, I'm in New York a few years back as well. And without any further ado, please join me in welcoming America to Google. Thanks.

Speaker 2:          00:00:34       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:00:35       Ah, thank you cliff. Thank you all for being here during lunch. Um, the food is really good if you haven't had it yet, you probably know it better than I do, but, um, it's, it's great to be here. Um, can you hear me okay? Is this fine? Um, so typically these days when I go to give a talk and bring up modern romance, everyone wants to know in advance is as z is coming. And um, you know, look, when you write a book with someone like Aziz, you learn to play the second fiddle. So I'm fine with that. Um, and the answer is usually, you know, I don't know. He could show up. So if anybody comes through this door in the next few minutes just, well let's all look and see if it turns out to be as disease. Um, it would be a little bit of a stretch for him because he's hosting Saturday night, Saturday night live this weekend.

Speaker 3:          00:01:22       You might've heard that it's the the day after the inauguration. So it's a high pressure gig. Let's say. Oh nope. It's not as easy as well the children next time someone comes in we'll, I'll look and we'll see if it's disease. It might be as, okay. What I want to do today is actually, I'm not talking exclusively about modern romance, as interesting as that is, I want to talk a little bit more generally about the sociology of connection, some patterns that are worth sharing. Um, and um, and I, and I want to do it by, by talking to you both about this book I wrote a few years ago called going solo about the rise of people living alone in the world and also then about the research that went into modern romance. And you'll see a common thread emerge through them. And the way I want to get into this is, um, by telling you about a magazine story that came out a few years ago from the Atlantic, which is a really serious and wonderful publication, always very provocative.

Speaker 3:          00:02:17       Um, definitely not a fake news publication, a real news publication. Um, the tends to go very deep and, um, they, they, they put this story on the cover a few years ago and I don't know if you can read it clearly, but the covers stories is Facebook making us lonely. And that's a question, but as you probably can tell already, it's also an accusation, right? Um, of course the answer to the cover story is not know otherwise. It wouldn't be on the cover. Right. And even if it was no, the deed is already done because you've associated Facebook with loneliness in your mind. And if I say don't think of an elephant, I've undermined myself in that very way. So, um, you here at Google need to know that the story about whether Facebook is making us lonely is not just a story about Facebook. Google is also part of the story because the broader question that this article is taking up and it's a question that many people in the world these days are raising is, is this new culture that we are creating and that you are creating as much if not more than anyone.

Speaker 3:          00:03:25       Uh, where we spend all this time with our screens on a amazing apps and programs and other, um, you know, features that, uh, entertain us and help us be productive and connect us and all kinds of interesting ways to people we'd never otherwise be connected to our, all those things at the end of the day, making us more lonely and more isolated than ever before. I'm sure all of you in this room have heard a version of this question, right? I mean, it's a big problem that we're trying to solve and the author of this piece in the Atlantic, which is a place that everybody who's got ideas and rights wants to be says yes. Uh, the claim in this article is that we have never been lonelier. Okay. We are now, ironically, we were living through the loneliest age and history and, okay, so that's a deep and serious journalistic publication.

Speaker 3:          00:04:20       In my own field we've had similar kinds of debates and um, I'm going to, this is, I'm going to talk to you about the study that was in the American sociological review, uh, on social isolation in American life. Now I know that you're all regular readers of the American sociological review, but occasionally, you know, you forget to put it that like little card in the mail and your subscription lapses. Um, so I'm just going to review for you the findings of that study if you don't mind. Um, and the, and the study on social isolation made this incredible claim. The article came out in, in 2006 and it was by a team of sociologists based to Duke. Um, and the, the, the blockbuster finding is the one that's on the screen there. It said that, um, they, they did a survey is based on a big social survey and they looked at the proportion of American adults who said they have no confidence, no close friends.

Speaker 3:          00:05:12       And it went from about one in 10 in 1985 which was fairly consistent with the long literature of studies on, on social connections to one in four in 2004. Now, obviously Facebook wasn't really a thing much of a thing in 2004 I don't think it was a thing at all. Um, but, so it's not Facebook that's driving the story there, but the, but the idea is that the big thing that changed in our social world in that time period is the internet. And so the claim was, you know, we're now more isolated than we've ever been in there. All these people who are disappearing and the Internet must be the cause of that. And, and when this article came out, it was, you know, this is a image from USA Today. The authors were on the today show and CNN and every publication in world did a feature on them because that's an incredible finding, right?

Speaker 3:          00:06:00       One in four Americans have no confidence. And even that claim doesn't come out of nowhere. There's a long history in the social sciences of looking at the fraying social ties, uh, of modern life, right? A longstanding claim that we have built these big cities we built to kind of all kinds of modern conveniences and a mass society. And out of that has come a level of isolation and disconnection that we've never before established. So these are among the best selling books in the history of sociology and the social sciences. Um, here on the other side of the political spectrum, uh, the American spectator, a right wing publication on the loneliness of American society. Think very similar ideas. More recently, probably some of you have seen books like bowling alone from Robert Putnam. Um, Sherry Turkle, I presume has been here to Google or to the New York Google to talk about her research on people being alone together.

Speaker 3:          00:06:55       More recently, she's got a book about the end of conversation. So this is a very big idea, right? And a couple of years ago when I set out to write a book, uh, about the social trend, I thought I would be contributing to that conversation. So when I sold the book for the book, for this research project, the working title was alone in America. Okay. Which fits really nicely into this tradition, right? And so clearly it was about to become a bestseller. Um, all you need is the right title. And as I started to do research, I learned a bunch of amazing things that really changed the way I think about this issue. And give me these things, continue to give me pause when I think about these issues today. And I want to walk you through some of them, right? So imagine if you were going to write a book called the loan in America, it would have a really different mood.

Speaker 3:          00:07:52       I really different cover image. Then they're going solo book, right? It's going slowly. You can see is a really different idea. So how did I get there? Well, this was the thing that made me want to write this book in the first place. I noticed what for social scientists is a staggering social change, right? So if any of you have ever been to a meeting of sociologists are demographers, when we discover something like a percentage point or two that's changed in a population trends, we're high fiving in the hallways, you know, or like spiking the clicker at the end of our talk. You know, that's a huge accomplishment to make. And the social sciences and you know, strangely there's not, had not been a lot of discussion about this, this, this staggering change that from from 1950 to 2014 the proportion of American adults who are single or unmarried goes from 22 to now about 50% right?

Speaker 3:          00:08:43       Half a slight. A slight majority of American adults are single today for the first time in recorded history. And the proportion of households that have just one person has gone from 9% in 1952 a little under 30% today. And these are major, major demographic changes in how we live. And I thought this should be exhibit a and the story of how Americans have become disconnected and lonely and isolated. And in fact, if you read a lot of research papers from other social scientists and surely lots of journalism, it is trotted out as exhibit a for why we're so lonely. Um, there are other ways to represent this trend here. You can just see the kind of steady rise of Americans who are living alone over time. Um, you know, this is a kind of demographic cut of who's living alone. It's interesting when, when I started this project, I had just written a book about a big heat wave disaster in Chicago were hundreds of people died and died alone.

Speaker 3:          00:09:39       And I thought the story of, of living alone in the U s was really primarily story of aging alone. But it turns out that the largest group of Americans who live alone are adults between the ages of 35 and 64 and in recent decades, the biggest spike in living alone has come from this younger generation under the age of 35. Right? Like you get married later, um, and you start a family much later. So the way that you become an adult for a rising generation there was to, is to get a place of your own right to get the hell out of your parents' basement and get a place of your own. So, so even this chart was really interesting to me. It seemed like a more interesting story. And I also learned what I was doing, the research that whereas up until about 1950, uh, living alone was something that was most common in big, sprawling western states.

Speaker 3:          00:10:28       Um, you know, in Nevada and Wyoming and Montana by, uh, 2000 living alone had become a very urban phenomenon. I was most common in, in major metropolitan areas. And you know, in Manhattan where I live, it's almost one and two households is a one person household and San Francisco is like 40%, you think, okay, San Francisco, New York, those are weird places. They're not quite like America, but look at this, you know, Minneapolis, 43%, Denver, 40%, Seattle, 42%, Atlanta, 45%. I mean, it really is far more pervasive. The one person household than I had understood and was actually far more pervasive than most social scientists had really understood before I did it. So this rise of a single society is a major force in the world. So remember I talked about this in terms of being alone in America at first because my premise was that these were people who are not just living alone, but also alone much of the time and more isolated, more lonely.

Speaker 3:          00:11:29       Um, I'm going to tell you about the alone part in a second, but I want to start by telling you like when you're a social scientist and not a politician, a or an eye, or look in an ideological, um, column writer, one of the great things is you get to be wrong and you get to be wrong. And then say, oh, I totally screwed that up and I learned something. And here at the end of the day, I have a different idea about how the world works. Then when I started, that's what's about social research. So let's start by how, how, what a bad idea it was for me to talk about this as alone in America. Living alone is not at all an American trend. In fact, the United States is a laggard and not a leader when it comes to being single. Uh, we are way down on this list of places that have a lot of living alone.

Speaker 3:          00:12:13       I don't know if you can read it. It looks very, very small to me, but the Scandinavian countries are at the very top of the list. A bunch of European countries are above us. Living alone is more common in Japan than it is in the United States, which is interesting given the kind of family centric nature of that culture. Living alone is more prominent in Canada and I don't know why, but just kind of irks me in general or Canada ranks ahead of the United States in anything. So that's always been an annoying, uh, finding for me. But say it again. There you go. There you go. Flip it around. Genius. We, when you kind of need more thinking like that and the next four years, I think. Um, so, um, okay. So what about this alone business? You know, are we really alone? Okay. Yes, more people are likely to live alone, but I started doing some research on my own.

Speaker 3:          00:12:58       I discovered some extraordinary thing. So for instance, um, it turns out that people who live alone are actually more likely to spend time with friends and neighbors and people who are married. They're more likely to go out at night and spend time in bars or in restaurants and cafes, uh, book talks and we're likely to book talks. Um, they are also more likely, and this was a real surprise to me to volunteer and civic organizations. So that idea of like the selfish single, the narcissist is not right. Um, here's a shocker for you. Um, uh, it turns out that um, women who are single and live alone are far more likely to participate, significantly more likely to participate in civic organizations than women who are married with children. Um, Tufts sociology, like I, someone told me that there's research showing that women who are married tend to do more of the housework than their, their spouses.

Speaker 3:          00:13:53       Like more, you know, they do more cleaning and more kink taking care of the children and things like that. I had exactly the same reaction. You did like a can't be true. There's no way that's right. But apparently, apparently it is. Um, and so women who are single actually I have more time to engage in the world. And you know, it's not to say that raising children is not a civic duty. It is of course, but it's an interesting and surprising finding this level of civic participation. But also if you look historically at patterns of informal social participation, you find a story that's very different than the, is Facebook making us lonely? Uh, we've never been so lonely. We've never been so isolated. These patterns which show kind of overall trends in spending time with relatives or with friends or with neighbors or in bars show that basically things haven't changed all that much.

Speaker 3:          00:14:46       Uh, over time we've had a modest decrease in the amount of time that we with neighbors, but we've also had an uptick in the amount of time that we spend with friends who aren't from our neighborhood, which is consistent with our understanding of the way we form social ties right now. Overall patterns of social participation or just about the same as they were before for informal socializing. Uh, and the percentage of people who are, who are really never social, who never socializing a is also a pretty stable. Um, so remember that research study I told you about the isolation in America? Well, it turns out that the data that that study drug drew upon, we're flawed and inaccurate. And now the, you know, one of the authors of this paper, the graduate student who did the real data crunching on this has backed off from the claim and says it's not reliable.

Speaker 3:          00:15:38       Um, uh, it turns out though that this is what my friends and I called the Great Zombie finding of the social sciences. Like, no matter how often we all kill the thing and say, oh, no matter how often we say that, it's, it's, it's not right. Uh, the, the, you can't kill this study. You, you see, like every time there's an article about loneliness or social isolation, a trend in American life, you will get in the first few paragraphs a citation to this study and serious scholars do it all the time. Journalists do it. It's a huge problem. Um, but you can understand like why that headline is so memorable. Um, imagine if, um, you know, when we put up findings like the one you just saw, the USA Today had a headline that said Americans just about as lonely and isolated is, we've always been, that would be a completely boring headline that no one would ever read or pay attention to.

Speaker 3:          00:16:33       Um, it turns out that our social life is much more interesting, um, but also more stable than, than people generally acknowledged. So I don't think that that we can events this claim right now. Um, we can't show that there's been a real spike in loneliness. In fact, the, the, the main claim even empirically in the Atlantic story about loneliness comes from a study that the arp did have older people who were in fact not even using Facebook at the time. So the data are really poor for this claim. And that's not to say that, that it's, there's not potential for us to become more lonely and more isolated given the way that we use technologies. But it hasn't happened yet. Um, who we should need to be a lot more somber about this. So I had written this book about the rise of single people in the world and I did it with the penguin press and a few weeks late, you know, I guess months after the thing came out, I got this call out of nowhere saying, uh, you know, Eric, it's your editor.

Speaker 3:          00:17:25       I'm sorry to bother you. I've got this kind of funny question. Have you ever heard of this? A guy named Aziz Ansari, and this is, you know, 2013 so he wasn't quite the household name. Um, but he wasn't expecting my response, which was Aziz Ansari. He's my hero. Um, cause it turns out, you know, I had become a big as Ansari sorry fan. And he said, oh, that's great news because um, we really, uh, we'd love to have you guys worked together on a project. And I said, well, what's the project about? And he said, well, let me explain and actually why even better, why you just come down here as these are sitting in my office, uh, and he wants to talk to you about it. So I dropped my, my things and raced over there, uh, to go talk. And here's Aziz his account of the thing that, that the problem that he was trying to work through at the time. You have a special out now that everyone's talking about and a Aziz Ansari buried alive. I understand you're already working on your next special, is that true?

Speaker 4:          00:18:22       Yeah. I voted you written the next hour we're going to start touring it, uh, next year. And um, yeah, this one's about kind of a, this new one that I'm working on is about kind of what it means to be single and this era. I think it's really a frustrating time to be a single person right now. You know, I like the idea of being single in theory, you know that's like, oh, you meet a bunch of different people. You get to know them when you meet someone you really like. You kind of pursue a deeper thing that that sounds cool. I would sign up for that, but that's not, we'll be in single is anymore now like this is, this will be in single is now.

Speaker 2:          00:18:50       Hey, it was great meeting you. We should get together sometime. Yeah, they'd be great. Be in touch. All right, cool. Bye. Hey, what's up? She would grab a drink tonight. Yeah. Yeah. I'm with some friends in this neighborhood. Oh cool. Be Down there soon. Can't wait to see you. All right, cool. Hey, what's up? We're almost there. Shit, we just lab. Why? Why did you just, why was on the way? Maybe get a drink tomorrow. Tomorrow's perfect. Texted him and make a plan. All right, cool. Bye. Hey, what's up? She grabbed those drinks tonight. All drank way too much last night. Going to stay in today. That's not what was discussed yesterday. You need a transcript of our conversation. Scroll up on your phone. Maybe we can meet up on Tuesday. Tuesday's perfect. Texted him and make a plan. All right, cool. Bye. Hey, what's up? As Tuesdays we get together today, Liz, now all that garbage.

Speaker 4:          00:19:41       It's pretty much now, a lot of times like you're a secretary for this really shotty organization. Scheduling the dumbest shit with the

Speaker 2:          00:19:50       flaky as people.

Speaker 3:          00:19:57       All right. So, so that was the, um, the, the problem that is ease with struggling with when I first met him, you know, um, okay. So there are all these people who were single today and diseases, one of them and the culture has really become confusing. Um, it like once upon a time, maybe it was easier to find romance. Maybe it was a simpler process. Now it seems really convoluted and as he's wanting to know, you know, we'll, we'll, what do we actually know about how the search for romance has changed over time? Um, what are some of the dilemmas that people face today? And he said, I've been looking for, um, for research or to try, he didn't actually read a lot of social science and I just couldn't find anything. So I just said, you know, screw it. I'm going to do it myself.

Speaker 3:          00:20:41       Um, well maybe I'll do it myself. Maybe I'll find a social scientist to do with me. Um, and so we decided to do it. And, you know, it was a very interesting collaboration. We had no idea what it was going to be like. It was a terrifying thing for me because, um, you know, I take my time pretty seriously, my, like most scholars and, uh, kind of cherish the ability I have to do research and, and uh, on the one hand, this is a tremendously exciting opportunity to work with someone who I think is really a genius and entertaining and insightful in ways that, you know, the great comedians are. But then the other time it was, on the other hand, it was a little bit of a wild ride to take. Um, but you know, you only live once and how could I say no?

Speaker 3:          00:21:20       Um, and that was the question, like which one of these combinations was it going to be? Um, so there's a bunch of things that, that, that we tried to do to get ourselves oriented to the questions for the book. I'm, one of them was just trying to figure out what the search for romance is aiming towards these days. And it's pretty clear that if you look at our search for romance, historically our expectations of what we want have changed quite a bit, even over the last several decades. Um, the way that we really establish this or that I was able to establish this for is ease. As I said, look, you know, most of the people you hang out with are in their twenties or early thirties, um, and you have this particular kind of world that you inhabit. We're here in Manhattan right now. Let's walk down a few blocks from the village to the lower east side.

Speaker 3:          00:22:10       And let's go to an old folks home. Let's go to a senior center and gather a bunch of people together for conversation, uh, and, and have them tell us about how they met their spouse. And he's, he's just like, oh, that sounds like a really good idea, but why on earth would a, anyone ever come and talk to us? They're not going to know who we are. You know, they've got other stuff to do. And I was like, no problem. We can solve this donuts. So we went and got boxes of donuts and we showed up at the senior center and everybody came for the conversation and it was a great conversation, a great way to recruit a sample. And we started asking people to tell us the story about how they met their spouse. And one after the next people would say, oh, well, you know, I was 23 years old and I was living with my parents and my older brother had this friend and I knew that guy.

Speaker 3:          00:22:56       Like he'd spend a lot of time around the family when I was a kid and you know, we went out one day and he seemed like a pretty good guy. So we got married and there was like, Oh wow, that's a crazy story. And then what next one? Oh, you know, there was a, someone who lives in my building and I know their family forever and I was 19 years old and I was living at home and one for, uh, for a few times. And we got married and we were like trying to figure out, well, this is an amazing thing. What's this about? That seems really odd. And, and people started explaining, well, actually, you know, the thing was that back then it wasn't really legitimate for you to move out of your parents' house, especially if you were a woman. If you weren't married and you really want it to escape your parental control, parental control.

Speaker 3:          00:23:35       And this was a great way to do it. Um, like premarital sex is really frowned upon. It's just no place to go. And so getting married, uh, was something that you did very early, uh, in life. And it was also something that you did very local. And so we heard these conversations. I said, you know, that rings a bell. I remember these studies that I had heard about in graduate school. Let me go back and see. And it turns out that in the 1930s and forties, there was an industry in American sociology of doing propinquity studies. And sociologists would look at things like the marriage records of 5,000 consecutive marriages in the city of Philadelphia and see, you know, who was marrying whom? Just cause you had to put your address for both the husband and the wife and the, and the wedding certificate. So this is one classic study from a guy named James Broussard.

Speaker 3:          00:24:19       It came out I think in 1933 and it's extraordinary. It shows that about, um, so this is, this, this unfortunately you can't see, but it's like around 12, 12% of marriages in the city of Philadelphia. This is just 5,000 straight marriage records where people who lived in the same building, okay, not related. Um, about four and a half percent, we're on the same block and 6% were within two blocks. So it's almost one in four marriages. And Philadelphia in 1932 were two between two people who live within two blocks of one another. You know, and as easy as like, I don't even, I wouldn't even want to go for coffee with one of those Bozos who live within two blocks of me, like let alone, let alone get married. And so something like 80% of all marriages took place to people who lived within 20 blocks of one another in Philadelphia.

Speaker 3:          00:25:15       And the typical age of first marriage around the time was something like 21 or 22 for women and 23 for men. Right? And when people were looking for what the sociologist Andrew Cherlynn calls the good enough spouse, they wanted a good enough marriage, like someone who was like, they're there. They, we're not an ax murderer. It was basically their number one characteristic and the number two, it was like they knew somebody in the family. And you probably grew up around that, right? So now, 2010, um, yeah, you know, 5% of people in 2010 married somebody who was a neighbor. Um, 22% met someone who they met online, married someone they met online to already today. A meeting online is the, is the most common way that Americans meet their spouses. Um, people still met in, in bars and got married. By the way, that's a tie.

Speaker 3:          00:26:05       If you're single, that's a terrible place to meet someone to get married. Don't, don't marry someone you met in a club, please. So it's a really bad idea. Um, uh, friends of friends, also very common, but you could see just how much the world has changed from, from 1930 to 2010 and it's extraordinary what this transformation is. And, and, and, you know, and, and by the way, that's, that's for straight couples. For same sex couples, uh, the, the, the use of the Internet is off the charts, right? And, and that was a kind of a wreck, a very difficult situation. If you grew up in a community where there weren't a lot of out, uh, uh, people interested in same sex relationships, it was very hard to find someone. The Internet has completely changed the game there, right? Uh, and, and, and what's happening now is, you know, we're starting to see these trends move into other areas and including, it's like second marriages, um, older people who are, uh, you know, looking for kind of a second marriage or third marriage after a divorce or a, uh, they've become widows or widowers.

Speaker 3:          00:27:07       The Internet is really growing as a, as a way to meet people. But when people look to get married, they're not just looking for good enough spouse anymore. Generally people in interviews will tell you they're looking for a soul mate, right? They're looking for someone who's, who's like, they completes, who completes them, uh, who with whom they feel like this kind of deep, deep, soulful connection that, that they wouldn't otherwise have in life. Right? And so not only do we think it's okay to look for a soul mate, that's what we should do. We're willing to spend a very long time in that search, right? So today we marry later than ever. Historically, the average age of first marriage is 26 or 27 for women and 28 or 29 for men in urban communities like this one, the average age of first marriage is over 30.

Speaker 3:          00:27:56       Right? If you work at Google and you've got like a 26 year old colleague who's getting married 50 years ago, it'd be like, that's amazing. I can't believe it took you so long, but congratulations. That's great news. I hope you can still get pregnant. And, and, and now if you have a 26 year olds gay man, he's like, are you crazy? What are you doing? You know, you have to live a little bit, you know, you don't even know who you're going to be yet. Right. And actually it turns out that, um, we know that if you get married before the age of 25, you are far more likely to get divorced. And if you get married after, and we have the sense that by kind of growing up as a, as a single person, you're in a better position to have a stable relationship over time and the date of bare that out a little bit.

Speaker 3:          00:28:37       So, so one big change is we have a different expectation, right? We're not looking for, we're not looking for a good enough marriages were looking for soul mates. Um, that's a very hard search. It can take a very long time, but the potential payoff can be very high. Another big change is obviously about the way that we do that search. And when I showed you some slides that suggested how much the Internet has become a part of this, but one of the, the, um, things that disease was convinced of and that was born out by the research we did over a couple of years, is that being single is very different in a world that where most of us live a lot of our lives in these machines, right? Anyone here happen to be carrying a phone with them today? Anybody have a phone with them? Um, w we do, of course you're, you're the only honest person in the room.

Speaker 3:          00:29:22       Um, we're all carrying phones with us. We all carry phones with us wherever we go. If we don't have our phones with us, we feel really weird. Like someone has, you know, like taking our oxygen away and um, and that's changed the way that we, that we live, right? We, we participate in this face to face world occasionally like speaking at Google and this series is amazing cause they'd be like, okay, like there's gonna be like 30 or 40 people at your talk, but there'll be 3000 people watching you from their desks. I'd be like, oh, that's in New York. That makes a lot of sense. Like it's too bad they can't be there. Like, no, like in the next room since we've weird does actually see you face to face. So Hi guys, watching on your screens right now. There's plenty of seats. You guys are all welcome to come and join us.

Speaker 3:          00:30:03       So we spend a lot of our time on our phones. And what that means is that whereas, you know, not long ago, if you wanted to meet somebody, you would go to like a bar or to a party, like friends of friends, you'd be set up on a date. And those things happen by the way. Like some people would do that at nine in the morning, but most of us did that after eight at night. You know, like you'd go out and those, like I remember like when I was in college Thursday or Friday night, you would walk out and you would all go to like a physical party together and you'd hope that that person who was in your history class, it was really cute, would show up and maybe even think like, oh maybe I know she's going to come to that party and you didn't have cell phones.

Speaker 3:          00:30:43       So you just hope that she was there and like the same hour block. And if not, you'd spend like the whole night walking around campus hoping you'd bump into each other. Right. And now it's like you would never do that because you would just text the person and find out if they were there. But more importantly, for people who aren't on college campuses, you're basically carrying a single's bar in your pocket all the time, right? So if you're here and you have a phone and you're single, and I'm sure there's at least one of you like that here, chances are, you know, you've got Tinder on your phone, right? You've got bumble in your phone, you've got Okcupid in your phone. If you're really serious about this, you've got matching your phone. You're like, I'm going to do that this year. 2017. I'm going to go from match.com I'm going to make a commitment.

Speaker 3:          00:31:26       Um, and that really changes the dynamics. It means that like at any given moment, you have access to thousands of potential partners and you could be flirting with them. You can be just kind of playing around like we were doing the research. Tinder had just come out and nobody wanted to admit that they're actually trying to meet people on Tinder. They're like, oh, I just did it as it was my friends kind of for a laugh, which is really, if we all thought it was funny, but you know, everybody was starting to date on Tinder. Um, and this is really challenging. Like it's hard to do the thing you're supposed to be doing at any given time because you are living with a single's bar in your pocket, right? That's a very tough situation. What that also means is you're looking for your soul mate.

Speaker 3:          00:32:03       You've got thousands of options and uh, people every day are presented with what Barry Schwartz, the psychologist talks about is the paradox of choice, right? Um, you know, you've got all these possibilities and it turns out it's really, really difficult to live with enormous numbers of options there. Maximizers in the world who are always looking for the best thing. And if we're looking for love, we're probably looking at, we're probably maximizers most of the time. And then they're satisfied writers who were just like looking for the good enough marriage, but they're not, a lot of those satisfies sirs. And the problem is now, if you are looking for the best relationship and you have Tinder, the the comparisons can never stop. Right? And so what's so difficult about choice Schwartz told us is, you know, first of all, when you have a lot of options, um, it's difficult to know what it is that you really care about.

Speaker 3:          00:32:52       You know, what, what should really mattered to you and how do you, how do you make a selection for a particular person? But then also, let's say I've gone through like 150 people on Tinder and I've swiped right and she swiped right too. And we make the connection and then we go and meet each other within five minutes. I'm like, oh, is that really the right person? Because there are one, you know, 999 other people who are there, you know, tonight. And if I, if like I managed to run to the bathroom and like swipe right again and see. So there's problem with people not feeling good about the choices they made because they have regret about the people they've overlooked. And that's an enormous challenge for people who are dating today. Um, then there are all kinds of interactional dilemmas, um, that happened when people are trying to find romance through machines.

Speaker 3:          00:33:39       Um, you know, the [inaudible], anybody here ever had this conversation with a friend? Like you meet somebody online and, or your friend meet someone online. Let's just talk about in terms of friends and they're like, oh, uh, I liked them and ask them out, but I don't know what the right messages. And the person's like, oh, it doesn't matter what you write. Like if they like your picture, they're going to like you. If they're like your picture, they're going to like you. It doesn't matter what you, what you texts, you know, don't even worry about the messaging. And anyone heard a version of that story? Yes, yes, yes. Okay. Thank you. Google is still alive. Um, okay. So as these, and I want it to get like the definitive scientific answer to this question of does it actually matter what you text someone or is it really just about the pictures?

Speaker 3:          00:34:20       Like, we know the pictures are really important. So, um, we realize that every night when disease is doing standup, he was talking to thousands of people and it was a great way to have conversations about, you know, people's experiences in the world. We could kind of use them as like massive social experiments and interviews and focus groups. So, um, I want to read you a quick passage from the book and if you can just like try to imagine me reading this in diseases, voice will be a much funnier. Okay. So he says at this particular show, I was speaking with Rachel who had met a guy and a good friend's wedding as it happened. The guy was also a friend of her sisters. So he had a pretty good shot at a first date with her. She was single, she was interested. All he had to do was send her a simple message, introducing himself and asking her to do something.

Speaker 3:          00:35:06       Here's what happened. He sends his first message, Hi Rachel. Exclamation point. Since I never got a chance to ask you to dance at Marissa and Chris's wedding parentheses, I'm Chris, his old roommate from Purdue. Dot. Dot. Dot. And parenthesis, he and your sister gave me your number. I wanted to say hi and sort of texty introduced myself. Haha. Smiley face. Hope you had a great weekend. Hope to chat with you soon. As soon as I said texty it was clear that no one sitting in the 3,600 seats, Chicago theater, whatever. Fuck this dude in a million years. Texty for whatever reason seem to be unequivocally disgusting to every one of us there. He might as well have added, by the way, I have a really disgusting next level STD. Haha Smiley face. But for real, I do. Rachel wrote back 10 minutes later by the, I recognize this is probably the end of the [inaudible] Google uh, seminar series here. So, uh, it is what it is. It was good while it lasted.

Speaker 3:          00:36:07       Hey, exclamation point. Great to meet you too. Currently enjoying my birthday weekend with lots of good Mexican food parentheses. It happens when your birthday is Cinco de Mayo. Hope you had a great weekend too. He wrote back shortly. I totally, there's like eight owes here. I totally realized upon reading my last message, I didn't include my name. I will smiley face for company on yellows as well and totally right. Digging on that Cinco de Mayo theme, Rachel never met will after a few messages of this nature, Rachel stopped responding. None of us know, well he may be a kind, handsome man with a heart of gold, but all we have to go on and it's those messages and those messages if shaped in our minds, a very dorky terrifyingly Caucasian Weirdo.

Speaker 3:          00:36:59       Yes, it matters what you text now. Um, it matters what you text, but it's hard still to know what is appropriate to tax and what isn't it because our norms about what you can communicate via text message are changing very rapidly and things, things that seem really strange to us today, you know, might soon be very normal. Um, and, and in fact, like even, even as we did the interviews for the book with people of different generations, we heard really funny things. Like, you know, when we started, we ask these questions. Like I said, I have this key, is it okay to break up with somebody by texts, you know, can you break up his own by text? And we talked to people who are in their late twenties I'd be like, oh, no way. You know that, that that is, I'm not, I know I'm not 30 yet, but still, that is a horrible thing to do to a person, you know, like breaking off is really painful and you know, you owe it to that person to be there face to face and just to say what you think and to have that physical interaction with someone.

Speaker 3:          00:37:58       Like I would never do that. And we talked to people who are like in their late or early twenties and they'd say, you know, I know that you shouldn't break up with somebody by tax. I mean it's a shitty thing to do. But honestly, like yes, yes I do. And we're like, we do everything by text. So I figure we might as well, like I asked her out by text, the first time's fine. So yes, I do it. I don't feel good about it. I know it's not right. Um, but I do it and we talked to like, people in their late teens, you know, like freshmen in college and be like, Oh my God is he is Eric. I wish someone would break up with me by tax. Like all I want in life is somebody to break up with him via tax. Like there's this guy I was seeing for months and I haven't heard from him in forever and I think we're not going out anymore, but I, you know, I don't really know because he doesn't respond. So if you just write me a text message and say it's over, it would be amazing. So we're even seeing this like change from these small kind of parts inside generations over time.

Speaker 3:          00:38:58       Right. The overall kind of threading through all of this is this question of, you know, returned back to this Facebook issue of this Facebook make us lonely. It doesn't make us lonely. But, um, now that we do spend so much of our time interacting with people digitally and now that our social worlds of expanded so that we interact with people who we don't know all that well personally, maybe we have, um, text-based relationships or they're part of a social circle, their friends or friends of friends, but they're still there. Um, does it make it easier for us to treat them as bubbles on a screen? Right. And not as people. And I don't think we've settled the, this question, but I think it, it really is an interesting question. You know, what, what is the evolving nature of social norms in a world where we're communicating with different kinds of people who are, you know, part of our network in some way.

Speaker 3:          00:39:51       Um, but not, you know, core intimate partners. Okay. Let me wrap up. Um, I always feel like I should provide some public service at the end of these talks. Um, so you know, people often want to know like, okay, you did all that research is very interesting. Uh, appreciate that a ton of time when you read from the Book and God is he his voice in there? Cause I actually got a genuine laugh in that moment. Um, but is there anything that you learned in the course of this project that can actually help me as a single person or my cousin? Um, and so I've got three things I'd like to close with today. Three short pieces of advice if you're interested anyone that'd be helpful just to get to the three. Kind of like dating tips from all this occasionally. Okay. We've got three, three, three dating tips that happy to come back on, uh, on Valentine's Day in a few weeks.

Speaker 3:          00:40:39       Um, okay. Number one. First a dating tip comes from, um, uh, actually comes from Robb Willer who's a sociologist and social psychologist at Stanford. If he hasn't come here, cliff, to give a talk, you should get him over here. He's a great, great guy, amazing speaker. Um, and rob was helping us with some of the, um, uh, analysis he's, he does to these terrific social experiments. But then actually what, what rob wound up helping us with the most came from his own life and he was like, oh well one of the problems with, with dating these days is like, you, you don't want to go on these really boring ass first dates. Everybody online does like the, they do this boring ass first dates. And the reason is that, um, can you raise your hand if you've ever gone on an online date in this room? Could you mind, I know where to workplace.

Speaker 3:          00:41:25       That's a little bit awkward. Okay. So, so, um, okay. So if you ever go on a first date with someone you met online, you know, the problem is you don't want to overinvest in the first, right. Cause this stranger and we know that they're like five years older and 25 pounds heavier than they look in their photograph. Right? And so, so nobody really wants to overinvest it's not like you have a first date, you know, we're going to men Raisa and then I rented a sailboat and we're going to do a cruise. But you never do that. But you also don't want to like go to Starbucks and have a latte because everything we know about research on dating says like our experiences and other person is contextual, right? And so the environment really matters. And if like you're sitting in a Starbucks having a Latte, um, it's going to be a really boring first day you're going to do a resume exchange and you're like, I don't know.

Speaker 3:          00:42:11       She wasn't that interesting. Um, it was just, I just, there was no spark there. So Rob said, oh, the, the first thing that people do wrong and what you should try to do if you're dating is you need to, you need to follow the monster truck rally theory of first dates. And that is every first day it should be in some place that's like super interesting and kind of quirky and it's going to make you laugh kind of no matter what you're doing. And it should be kind of surprising and kind of fun monster truck rallies he likes because especially for like the overeducated tech, you know, silicon valley people, you know, you probably don't spend a lot of time at monster truck rallies. But if someone said like, Hey, let's go to a monster truck rally, you'd be like, Whoa, that seems like a really interesting and fun idea we're going to do it.

Speaker 3:          00:42:53       And it's like the quality of the whole interaction and the quality of the evening is going to be really great. And so you don't have to go to a monster truck rally, but the idea is like for your first date, do something that's like you always really wanted to do on your own, but you just don't have enough time and use the date as an excuse to go do that fun thing with another person. It makes sense. Okay. That's tip number one. Okay. Now this one, you probably, you probably studied this in your um, social science classes in college or graduate school. You probably familiar with the flow, right? A theory of acquired likability through repetition. You. You remember that one now? Okay, fine. Um, uh, at the end of this talk I want you to resubscribe to the American Sociological Review and review your psychology notes from, from college.

Speaker 3:          00:43:39       Okay. The flow ride, a theory of acquired likeability through repetition is basically tells us that in the end people are pretty much like flo rider songs, which is you hear them the first time you're like, I don't know, I've heard that song. I don't know this. The flow riders has same song. It's not that interesting. Ah, I don't need another one of these. But then if you keep listening to the flow rider song again and again, you're like, oh my God, Flo rider, you are amazing. I love that song. It turns out we have very similar responses to people that if you have like a second date, a third date, the things that are specific and interesting and distinctive about people are not actually the what they look like. It's, there are things that come out in interactions over time. And the big mistake that data is generally make is they tend to overvalue superficial things on the first date.

Speaker 3:          00:44:33       Like hotness and, and, and undervalue things that, right? Because we all know that that kind of the, the temperature of the hotness is going to decrease no matter what. No matter who it is that you're dating. Right. And we probably, everyone in this room wants like dated someone who they thought was way more attractive than them and they're like, I can't believe I'm actually dating her. And then like on the third day, like, oh my God, I have nothing to say to this person. Right? So we tend to overvalue hotness and we tend to undervalue the things that actually really matter to us over time and in relationships. And those are things that tend to come out over repeated exposure and interactions, right? Which not to say like attraction doesn't matter. Of course in traction matters, there's a baseline that you have to hit, but there are a lot of people who are like, I dunno, she seemed pretty cool.

Speaker 3:          00:45:16       Yeah. If she, I guess she was pretty attractive. There just wasn't that spark on the first time. You're like, what'd you do? Oh, we were at a bowling alley bowling. That sounds so fun. Oh No. We were in the lounge having a coke. You know, you're never going to fall in love with someone in a bowling alley lounge on a first date over coke. It was a bad way to fall in love. So give someone a chance. That's the second one. And then the third one, this might be the most practical thing. Um, I want to leave you with, so there's another kind of dilemma and problem that people have in a world where we all, a lot of our relationships are online and that is like, okay, you start dating somebody or with them for a while. You build up this relationship, you have all these friends in common, you not only share experiences together, you now share phone world and a digital life together.

Speaker 3:          00:45:54       Like you posting pictures of her and him, they're all over it. You're all over Instagram and Facebook, that your lives are totally intertwined. And then he break up and now you've got this problem, which is that like you can't get rid of this person from your history and you want to go back and like look at the picture of vacation pictures or pictures of yourself at party, see like the friends or the experiences you had. But every time you do it, you have a photograph of your acts with you. And so as these, and I found a great strategy for dealing with this, uh, it's just called [inaudible] and your ex. And what that means is it doesn't have to be Beyonce, by the way. You can do this with Sonia Sotomayor. Um, you could do it with, you could choose Rick Perry. Uh, there's any number of people you could do. Basically you want to pick a, a fairly well known person and just get an image of their face and just paste it over the image of your acts all over the Internet and that will solve all of your problems. So thank you very much. Um,

Speaker 5:          00:46:45       I really enjoyed the conversation. I hope that was useful.

Speaker 3:          00:46:52       Hi. So, um, yeah, I was really light in to hear about how your findings disproved, like that really popular study that you said it was unfounded, that people are actually lonelier now than before about that or the study that that showed that people were looking. Yeah, it kind of like brought to my mind this quote that got circulated shortly after the death of Robin Williams, which I think I'm going to misquote it, but it's this phenomenon of the worst thing is, and to be alone but is to be around people who make you feel alone. So I guess from your studies, how do you, that like technology has contributed to that feeling and like what do you actually call that? Yeah, so that's a really interesting question. So, um, there is this issue that's a little bit related to the problem of choice that I brought up before.

Speaker 3:          00:47:45       Uh, and that is that many people today find it very difficult to be where they are. So think about the last hour that we've spent together. You know, now, um, it's very hard for most people to spend an hour without checking their phone to see what's happened. Did anybody check your phone in the last hour? Come on. This is the greatest hour of my life then. I mean, everybody checks their phone all the time. And you know, I, I know like I've don't take it personally that you checked your phone in the last hour. We are hooked on these things. We were looking for this new stimulation, right? We wondering what's going on in our personal life and our home life. Um, w w who won the soccer game. Uh, there's all sorts of information that we could be getting at any time, which is actually generally not all that urgent, but were somehow in this cultural moment where not everyone, but a lot of us are kind of hungry for the next new burst of information.

Speaker 3:          00:48:49       Like we want that adrenaline rush, that endorphin kick that we're going to get from getting the new thing. And so we're constantly failing to appreciate the place we're in and the people we're with. And what I oftentimes think now is like unless you are sitting directly across to or next to a person you have met in the last three weeks and are currently in the process of falling deeply in love with, there's almost no thing that you're going to be doing that's going to completely distract you from like the buzzing noises you're phone is making in your pocket. Right? It's very hard for people to focus on where they are. And so what, you know, what happens is it becomes very easy to degrade the quality of everyday interactions and to take your relationships for granted. And I do, I do worry about that. So that's not exactly kind of the loneliness of being alone.

Speaker 3:          00:49:45       It's a different kind of experience. Now, interestingly, that doesn't show up on, uh, surveys of how lonely people are, the best measures we have of for loneliness. Don't tap into that. But I do think that that's a phenomenon that that's worth paying attention to. And I'll tell you something from the going solo project that was very powerful to me. Um, so many people I interviewed who had lived with someone and who then, uh, you know, get separated and became single and they've done their own, said, you know, my friends are always worried about me. They asked me if I'm lonely and what I tell them is yes, there are moments of real pain when I'm home by myself single and thinking about what my future is going to be like. But I'll tell you the truth. There's nothing than a bad relationship. There's nothing lonelier than living with the wrong person.

Speaker 3:          00:50:34       That is very true. Okay. Eric, thanks so much for coming. Um, so you brought up the topic of, um, now we're more searching for our soul mate other than just a spouse. That's good enough. Um, and I noticed that even now that we're, uh, some people even find that soul is not good enough. They want something more than saw me. Well, what's that twin flame? What twin flame. Oh, that's so weird. It's a new thing. Yeah. It's like, so may plus. Plus, are there actually any research saying that finding your soul mate actually makes you happier? Because I'm very skeptical about, uh, oh no, no, there's no research like that. No, I mean there really isn't. And so, so it's not, it's not as if, you know, what I'm reporting to you is that in fact people find their soulmates. Um, and we know that if you find your soulmate and match on all the key criteria of like what constitutes a soul, then you'll be okay.

Speaker 3:          00:51:28       You'll be happy. I mean, we don't have that, right. So people are optimizing for a random set of things. And one thing we do know is that, um, we're terrible at knowing what it is that we want and another person. And what the reason we know this is because of all the great data that we get from, um, from dating sites where people, you know, like you go on match.com and you say like, here are the five things I'm looking for. You know, like I want a blonde, a woman who has a phd from an Ivy League school in the natural sciences, not the social sciences, right? And she has to like skiing and be pro choice and then like you like turn out that if you, if you look at what that person is actually choosing, like who is that person asking out? Right?

Speaker 3:          00:52:10       They're like tall brunettes who grew up in the south and have a high school degree, right? And like volleyball and vote for Republicans. And it turns out that that like we're just really shitty it knowing what it is that makes us happy. And so, so like the kind of research that you're asking for of like how, you know, how are we actually matching is really hard to come by. That said, um, oh and I should say one other thing. Uh, there's actually a really interesting research on arranged marriages because as these parents had an arranged marriage and we talked about this a lot, like we did interviews with them when we looked into the research on arranged marriages. Um, like at some point we were sitting together doing research and I start cracking up because it's easy to just told me how his, his father met his wife and married his wife were found, has found his wife and his story, it was like he, his parents decided it was time for him to get married.

Speaker 3:          00:53:00       They like introduce them to one woman and she was too tall. And then they introduced them to the woman who became his wife and she was, it was like the right, that was the right decision. And it occurred to me that actually like as he spends more time trying to figure out where to get a Taco, then his father spent figuring out who, which was the right woman to marry. Like if you ever wanted to eat with Aziz is incredibly difficult. Like he's totally an optimizer and maximizer and he does like enormous amounts research on everything because why would you ever want to have the second best Taco in the East village? Um, and that can be really difficult. But his, but his step father or his father went through this like pretty simple process. And it turns out with her and arranged marriages, there's this idea like, you know, when the marriage begins, there's kind of like a simmer, like just a little bit of heat.

Speaker 3:          00:53:44       And then over the course of time in successful marriages, you kind of build up to the boil and the intimacy. And actually the record on arranged marriage is pretty strong in terms of longevity compare and, and people's feelings about the quality of the marriage compared to our system of like marrying the person you want to marry by choice after having search for your soulmate. So that, I think there's really, really good reason to be, to be skeptical, you know, of that. But what we do know, I was gonna say that said is that there does seem to be some value in waiting until later in life to get married. And we do know that there's a lot of volatility in people's, you know, formative years, both in terms of your life where you know where you are and what you're going to do and in terms of your character development.

Speaker 3:          00:54:30       And so, you know, people who marry younger without having gone through that search are just more likely to have the relationships burnout. So that was a somewhat of noxious and long winded answer to your really smart question. So my question, um, focuses on cohabitation. So the, you know, the fulfillment of happiness when you're living with someone kind of depends on like your level of sloppiness. Can the other person cook, did they clean up? You know, like all those things they got to be biographical about this. But from what I understand, cleaning up after yourself. Yeah. So my, my question is what's the research or your, if there isn't research, what's your personal opinion on, you know, our couples more successful if they live together or apart? Let's do you know, people who might have different houses or apartments, but they're married for example. Yeah, I don't, I don't know this debate as much as I should probably.

Speaker 3:          00:55:24       I have a memory of reading studies showing that actually there was a relationship between cohabitation and separation down the road, that people were more likely to ultimately divorce if they cohabitated before marriage. But that was just like a simple correlation and then it turns out if you tease, tease it out, there was something about the composition of the population, like people who are more likely to live together first were also more likely to be in a population of people get divorced. So to be honest, I don't, I can't give you like the state of the art finding on that, but there's definitely a lot of research on it. Um, definitely not. Definitely not writing about that issue. Um, because it would be weird because I, okay so I'm married, I want to be clear about that. Which was very difficult for me when I was doing the going solo book cause I was like inadvertently became this person who like Eric Klinenberg.

Speaker 3:          00:56:14       We'll talk about the joys of singlehood, which is not like that. What I was not what I was going for, but I wound up like writing this book about how actually people who live alone and I didn't even, you know, like they're very social, they tended to like, turns out the happiness levels are much higher than we thought. And then so I would get invited to all these like singles, you know, celebrate single. And my poor wife was like, you know, at first I thought this was like, you're kind of escape fantasy book and now I'm getting a little bit worried about this, this project. And then I started writing a book, you know, about how young people like hook up basically. And that was spacious. And so if I'm like, yeah. And then my wife and I did cohabitate before we got married. So if I got really deep into that question, she, you know, she probably already has a lot of doubts to begin with. So the thing is a bad idea. Yeah. I'm not going to do that, but thanks for the suggestion.

Speaker 6:          00:57:13       Uh, so if you learn a lot more about yourself as you grow up, uh, and you're supposed to wait, you till you get older as you marry, uh, w what are you supposed to do in the meantime? Like I just graduated from college. I just like told him my thumbs for 14 or 17. Know this guy who's sitting next to you? You guys ever met? No, he's, look, yeah cause you're looking at here like

Speaker 3:          00:57:32       what the fuck are you talking about? What I use? Are you serious? No bike Blake. Shit, you're single in the bay area and you work at Google. What do you mean what are you supposed to be doing in the next day? No, no, but, but you guys talk after this. He's going to tell you where to go.

Speaker 6:          00:57:52       Well wake, should you date people seriously? Like you know, like the idea of like, should you be in your long plus relationships or should you be, you know, trying out more. I don't know. I mean just kind of curious what the research says.

Speaker 3:          00:58:09       I'm going to let you know what I have decided to do. I'm just going to have put, like, I'm going to work in one of these private offices after the talk and I'm just going to take you like one at a time. Like I kind of like the haircut truck you guys have on campus. I'd be like a relationship adviser and you can just come, you have to pay for the haircuts here, right? So like the Tacos, the Tacos are free, but you got to pay for the haircut. So you'll probably, I'm going to charge for these sessions, but you could come. No, I look, I think there's value in being in relationships and you know, if you meet, if you're, if you meet someone who is, you have a wonderful connection with and um, you're, it really gels and you, you know, it's like the right thing.

Speaker 3:          00:58:45       I'm not trying to say, you know, it's, that's a crazy thing, right? Like I, I'm a social scientist and I'm thinking about large population samples and I'm thinking probabilistically, right? So, in your case of one person, you, you know, you, you're going to know what's right for you, better than a sociologist who's looking at big populations. Um, you know, that said, um, uh, you know, I think there's, there's lots of value in being in relationships. There's lots of value and having intimate experiences with someone else. There's no rush to get married, certainly in a rush to get married and have children. Um, you know, once you start to in these parts of your life that things get difficult and if you wind up changing in ways that were unpredictable, um, you know, you're, you find that you're, you're constrained. And it's interesting like this, this is really a deep thing about the cultural situation we find ourselves in.

Speaker 3:          00:59:34       Um, since the late 19th century, there has been a concept in sociology that I like quite a lot called the cult of the individual. And it refers to the way in modern life that we have come to, to value. Uh, the, the what's good for me, what's good for the individual as opposed to what's good, what's good for the collective that I'm a part of. Right. And there's kind of a famous line about, you know, w w why would, why would a family and trust something as important as marriage to, uh, like other people getting married? The marriage is not about two people. When two people get married, it's a, it's a, you know, it's a family. It's a family event. It's structures, groups of people. Why would you let two young, stupid people make a decision like that? Right? So, so what's happened over time is that our sense that our behavior should be oriented towards optimizing the group experience, right?

Speaker 3:          01:00:34       The group wellbeing has been replaced by a notion that our behavior should optimize our individual condition. Right? It used to be the case that if you were in a bad marriage and you were really unhappy and you want it to get divorced, not very long ago, you would have to justify to your friends, into your family this decision to get divorced. This was the wrong thing to do. But now if you're in a bad marriage and you're really unhappy, you'll have to justify it to your friends and family, why you should stay in it. Because our notion is like if you as an individual aren't fulfilled and getting what you need than it is wrong for you to be in that situation. So our, you know, our values have really shifted on this. Um, and so the, you know, that's when we talk about like don't put yourself in a binding situation that, um, is going to be difficult for you down the line depending on who developed.

Speaker 3:          01:01:26       That's it. I just want to call attention to my own response to what you're saying, which is like, that is rooted in a very specific cultural understanding of what constitutes good behavior in a good life. And it is quite remarkable. I, you know, I've found throughout these projects, I've done the extent to which our sense of what's good ethical behavior is rooted in our commitment to ourselves as individuals, as the prime actors. So that was a great way for me to dodge the substance of your question. Well, I'm saying something, you know, marginally interesting. Okay,

Speaker 7:          01:01:59       final question. So, uh, what you'll be writing about next and who you hope that call is from. So you got to meet a zs. You didn't know that he was curious about this topic. If there's anybody else that you'd like to partner with, who would it?

Speaker 3:          01:02:13       Oh Wow. So I'm writing now book about what I call social infrastructure. And those are the places and, um, institutions that shape the way we interact and actually, um, plead a Google. One of the things I really want to study is, um, workplaces and how, um, how can you design a, a workplace so that you, um, facilitate interactions and promote cohesion and connection. Um, and while I'm here in the bay area, I'd really like to know more about what Google does. So if anyone here happens to work at Google or you're connected to anyone who works at Google and you could help me, I would really appreciate that. Uh, um, I'll even, I'll give you back all of my speaker's fee speaking fee for today is the lecture. I will refund 100% of my speaker's fee, um, for, for that, uh, information. So I would love to, I actually love to learn more about Google, um, and writing that book. And who would I be unable to say no to if they called me and asked if I could write a book with them?

Speaker 3:          01:03:19       I don't, I haven't even thought about that question. Can I get back to you on that? Sergey and Larry, now those chomps, what do they know? Um, now, um, I don't know. I don't know. I got, it's such a good question. Dammit. I wish I knew the answer to that question. Continue that. I'm going to think about it. Taking suggestions. Uh, Hu [inaudible] Daniel Conaman. Oh yeah, he's got a new book about him already though. It's probably better than what I could do a confirming. Say that again. Nick Offerman, you continue the parks and directories. Actually, I did get a call from, um, key and peels agents right after the book came and asked me if I would come and talk to them. And then I got really scared that I would just become known as that social scientists who writes with Comedians, uh, and I didn't do it. So plus, as you can all tell, like what really happened to me as I developed this like fantasy that I too would someday become a comedian and find a social scientist to write with me. Um, but I think we're a long, long way from that happy day. So are we done? [inaudible] thank you.
