Speaker 1:          00:07          Thank you all for uh, for being here. Um, it's uh, yeah, I'm, I'm, I'm glad to be here too. Um, so I'm going to be talking about translation. Translation is a huge topic that people can come out from lots of different angles. Um, I imagine this is quite a multilingual and transnational kind of audience. Is it, I mean Google is obviously a hugely international company. Um, so translation and communication between languages I guess is something that is important in your organization, in your working lives. Um, I'm going to try and mainly talk about things that are different from that. Um, what I'm going to do is say a little bit about, uh, you know, a bit more about who I am and where I'm coming from. So my interest in how I got interested in the field of translation. Then I'm going to look at various different instances of practices of moving between languages, which couldn't get called translation because I think one of the things to see and thinking about translation is that there are lots of different kinds of thing that couldn't get called translation.

Speaker 1:          01:01          So what we're really dealing with here is an umbrella word with lots of different, um, ways of doing things that are different and important ways that nevertheless all get called translation. Um, then I'm going to try to think a bit about the relationship between translation and languages because if you've got translation, then you have to have languages. But what is the language anyway? Um, and how does the practice that we call or the range of practices that we call translation relate to the kind of range of phenomena that we call languages. Um, and then I'm going to ask how things might be changing, um, now. Um, and I hope you'll be able to help me with that because obviously the internet and what Google does is a huge part of, of how the whole landscape of communication is changing at the moment. Um, so what, why is this interesting to me?

Speaker 1:          01:48          So I'm a literary person. Um, I write novels is Yon said, and I also write literary historical books. So when I was a kid I was interested in just in reading. Um, and then I did the very typical thing that happens in the UK, which is so, I mean, it's not really a monolingual culture, but there are large stretches of UK culture, which, you know, are predominantly monolingual. So I did the thing that's very typical for a kid in the UK. He likes reading. I went to university and I found myself studying a subject called English, um, without having really, you know, realize that that was what was going to happen. So when I was a teenager, I liked reading books, you know, from lots of different places. And they didn't really matter to me whether they were in translation or not. Um, and I found myself in a university structure, um, that was set up, uh, in, I mean, this happened to be in Cambridge, but it could have been in many other universities and institutional structure that was set up early in the 20th century when the idea of Englishness and creating an English national identity was really important.

Speaker 1:          02:43          And so the notion, the attachment, the idea that what you should read is kind of English books, uh, was quite a sort of dominant. Um, idea there as it also is in the university where I teach now, which is awesome. Um, what I found myself getting interested in was writers who weren't really very English at all. So I found myself getting interested, particularly in some writers from the mid 19th century. For instance, Robert Browning, I don't know if you, you know any of his poems, but, uh, he's the right, he very much likes setting his poems in foreign countries, especially Italy. Um, and setting them in the past. Um, and creating a setup in which you have to imagine that the person is speaking. The poem is speaking quite a different language is speaking, you know, the sort of Italian, the Italian spoke in the 16th century and the other words on the page are English words.

Speaker 1:          03:28          And so there's a sort of silent implicit translation that's part of what's going on in the poem. Um, and indeed, another thing about what branding does is that he writes, you know, like many poets, many literary writers, he uses language in strange and surprising ways. Um, and part of how he came to do this, it struck me is that he's very interested in taking ways of using language from other languages and trying to bring them into English. So for instance, there's a poem from 1855 called an epistle containing the strange medical experience of Car Sheesh, the Arab physician, a branding doesn't know Arabic, but he's got a sense of what Arabic, um, is like. And he tries to write his English in such a way that it has a kind of strangeness about it. So for instance, there'll be lines, the speaker will say things like, instead of saying, I arrived at Jericho, the speaker will say, my journeyman's were brought to Jericho.

Speaker 1:          04:21          And what I got interested in was, you know, and that's quite as a piece of literary writing. That's a strange and interesting line, but it's come to be like that through translation. And so what I was noticing increasingly in the stuff I was reading and getting interested in was an overlap between translation and literary creativity. When you look at a literary texts, you wanted to do something new in language. And quite often actually, you know, surprisingly often new stylistic things were being done in language through either actual translation or sort of being aware of what another language would be like. So I had that, but then I also had this in my mind, this sort of cliche that there is around in the culture that translations are never as good as the original literature always loses something in translation. Poetry is what is lost in translation as the American poet Robert Frost is, is reported as having is reported as having said, I thought it Google of all places we wouldn't have this kind of problem with the Avl, but hey, it's nice to know.

Speaker 1:          05:25          Um, anyway, uh, yeah, so that was one thing. Then the, the other thing is that when I started writing fiction, so, um, I grew up in a completely monolingual standard English speaking household in London. Um, but my parents were scientists and so they spoke actually a language that was quite strange to me. Lots of scientific words that I didn't understand when I was a kid and I still don't really understand. Um, and I found that when I started writing fiction, I was interested in using kinds of English that weren't universally compensable. Um, so Maura, or at least are a bit peculiar. Um, so my first novel is in the voice of an interior designer. He uses lots of interior design jargon. Um, and I was interested in the sort of distinctiveness of that voice. And my second novel has got a cause. My family of doctors, my second novel has got, it's very much in the mind of a doctor.

Speaker 1:          06:20          And I was interested in that special language that doctors know, that allows them to describe the world and understand things about people that, you know, people just be ordinary English like me, can't do. So I kind of mucked up on frantically mugged up and lots of medical terminology in order to, um, in order to create this character. So what I realized I was working with there was the feeling that, um, English isn't just a language. English is a whole range of different ways of using the language and actually to move, you know, one encounters I encounter, everybody encounters kinds of languages. The counters, one's own language, you know, a kind of languages that counts as English that I don't understand. And that's an experience that happens the whole time. It happens when I'm talking to my kids. It happens when I'm talking to someone who knows the technical language that I don't know.

Speaker 1:          07:10          So I got interested in how it translation can also happen within the things that we think of as, as being languages, not just between them. Um, but alongside that, um, there's quite a while it seems to me quite a loose way of thinking that says, well, everything is translation. Really. All communication is translation. You find people, this is a donor if you come across this, but this is the sort of phrase that floats around. And I don't like that phrase because as soon as you expand a word enormously like that, expand it metaphorically like that, it loses all or meaning. But I found that I was interested in, you know, um, I've, I was nevertheless though, um, I was interested in the idea that translation can happen within a language as well as between it. Um, so those really are the two or the other to sort of overarching questions that I bring with me to the topic.

Speaker 1:          08:02          One is everyone thinks that poetry is lost in translation and yet my experiences that you can create poetry through translation. Um, the other one is I don't really like the phrase or communication and translation because I feel it's meaningless. Nevertheless, I'm really interested in the idea that translation happens within a language, you know, between different kinds of the same language as well as between different languages. Um, okay. So what I'm going to, uh, yeah, so that's, that's, that's sort of a, that that's kind of where I'm coming from now. What I want to do now. I've had a little drink.

Speaker 1:          08:40          He's just though cause some instances of things that some as it were, scenes of translation, uh, from different moments and different cultural places and different moments in history just to get a sense of the variety of the field as it were. Um, so the first one is the school classroom. And this is where I learned my language is, and maybe this is a kind of familiar, a familiar environment to many of you. So in a classroom or you're in an exam hall as here and there's a passage of a foreign language on the whiteboard or on the blackboard or on the text and you have to translate it and your translation is going to be marked by the teacher or the examiner. Um, so you're going to get ticks and crosses and you'll get, you'll get a mark as a result of that. So what's happening in this instance of translation or this scene of translation is firstly it's subject to discipline.

Speaker 1:          09:35          Um, and I think as soon as you're using the word translation questions of right and wrong or better and worse kind of come into the room as well. So the idea of translation, the idea of discipline kind of belong together. The other general point I want to bring from this particular context is that the kind of translation that school kids or students do in order to show that they know the language is a very, is a particular kind of thing. So the teacher is marking it and the teacher is saying, can I tell from this translation that the student has understood the text in the original language? Well enough. And so in that environment you're doing something that's called translation, but what's controlling what you actually do is the need to show the teacher that you're understood the foreign language. And that means that lots of kind of freedom that say literary translators, translators of novels or translator, he's just somebody speaking in somebody else's speaking to interpret orally.

Speaker 1:          10:31          Um, that the kinds of of of, uh, thing that in those circumstances you're able to do in a school or university setting, you are not able to do because you're subject to this discipline of showing that you've understood this grammatical form and this phrase and this idiom and so on. And that's why the kinds of translations that get done in school context, we'll get done in academic contexts often, you know, read and quite a stilted way. Um, because they're not being designed to be read. They're being designed for this particular, um, academic exercise. So the general points I wanted to get from that are there translations and we're just into our language. Um, it's being done in a particular context, subject to a set of particular expectations for a particular purpose. Um, so, and those were always things when you're thinking about what's going on in any instance of translation, those are always things that are going to, or that you need to bear in mind.

Speaker 1:          11:25          I want to briefly to contrast this with a much kind of freer, um, or, or kind of multilingual, um, kind of context moving across languages. So say you've got a group of, I mean as I guess happens in this building quite a lot. Let's say you've got a group of people speaking, they all know different languages. You want to communicate, um, you want to find a shared medium of communication. Maybe English is the shared language, but the people speaking are coming from different languages into English speaking English or speaking English in slightly different ways. And you sort of negotiate a medium of understanding, don't you? So say there's an Italian speaker and the Italian speaker might say to the English, speaking in Bocca Lupo in Bocca Lupo is an Italian way of saying good luck. Literally it means in the mouth of the wolf. Then your speaker might not understand.

Speaker 1:          12:08          The Italian speaker might explain, the French speaker might say, you know, Marshalls or something and you'd have a kind of, on the one hand are kind of coming to understand, but on the other hand is sort of freer area of language mixing, which is quite different from the classroom setting. So that's showing how what happens across languages can be quite different in a, in a, in, in a different setting. The other thing it's showing, which I'm not sure how much I'm going to talk about, but maybe we can talk about in discussion at the end. Um, yeah, we'll talk about it. And discussion at the end is the, the real importance of the difference between spoken language and how people behave with their voices and written language and how people move across languages when they're dealing with writing. Um, or on a screen. And actually the, the, the, you know, the Internet was obviously blurring that distinction to some extent.

Speaker 1:          13:02          Um, but I'm just going to leave that there for the moment. Um, and come back to it. Now. My next example is from back in the 16th century. Um, and who we have here is the sultan. Um, the Ottoman sultan in Constantinople Sultan Murad the third. Um, and we have Queen Elizabeth the first of England. Um, and they're writing letters to each other or they're in diplomatic communication. Um, and um, the way that works is that, um, no one really in the Turkish court understands English and no one really in English court understands Turkish. So they use Italian as an intermediary language. And obviously both these rulers are tremendously proud and you know, each one has a very, as a very vivid sense of her own importance or his own importance, but they need to negotiate in the way they communicate to one another in such a way as to, uh, you know, not spark a conflict or, or not fall out too much.

Speaker 1:          14:08          And so the person who's charged with this is the translator person who's charged, not only with putting the meaning across from one person to another, but also sustaining a peaceful channel of communication is the translator and the Turkish word for this kind of translation struggle, man. Um, and there's a lovely bit in one of their, um, and one of their letters where the sultan writes, you know, Elizabeth has written a letter to, to south and the third, and he writes back saying, thank you Monique for demonstrating your subservience and devotion to me. Um, and I've, I've got, um, I've got the, uh, my Turkish is not really good, but his are, it will be deactivate the last than that. I can't speak Turkish, but those are the, the um, the Turkish words and the dragon looks at that and things. And Elizabeth the first is not really going to be very pleased to see that he thinks that she is subservient to him.

Speaker 1:          15:00          Uh, so when he translates that into Italian, he says, uh, he changes it to thank you for showing censhare Amie Gto. Thank you for showing sincere friendship. Um, towards me. And when she receives the letter a, that's what she understands. And the same thing happens the other way and you've got to think of how sweet and how, you know, how unusual. But actually, um, this, uh, so what we have here is an instance of translation and diplomacy going together. And the point I want to draw from this is that translation is also always a matter of doing something that's going to be acceptable in the community that you're moving the text into. So when you're wondering, okay, um, here's the thing, this other language, I'm writing it in this language, I'm going to translate it into this language, but I need it to be readable. I need people to accept it.

Speaker 1:          15:48          Um, I need people, yeah, I need, I need it. I need to put it into language in a way that is going to be acceptable in the community I'm putting it into language for. So the general point I want to take from this, uh, Elizabeth, the first and salt and Morehead instances that translation's always got an element of diplomacy in it is not just about, again, it's not just about moving from one language to another language. It's about recognizing the, uh, language is a medium of communication for a culture, for a community. And uh, thinking about entering into that community as well. My last instance, um, is from a long time earlier. So it's from, um, the very first years of what we call the common area in China. Um, and the situation here is the um, uh, Buddhist holy people, but his monks who knew the Buddhist, we're moving from India to China, just walking.

Speaker 1:          16:49          Um, and they knew that bit of suture is by heart in a language, perhaps in Sanskrit, perhaps in one of various other languages. And they are arriving in China where people are speaking kind of varieties of Chinese and they want the holy techs to be translated into Chinese. And how did this happen? Um, the way this happened was that the holy person he'd traveled from India would knew the takes stop by home, would recite it in front of a whole group of people in front of the BN assembly of Chinese holy people. And they'd listen and they'd consider an they'd agree together what they thought. The best translation of this, these words in Sanskrit or other possible languages would be made agree that, and then somebody else would do the thing of, of writing it down into a format. There's, this isn't actually a tax from, it's a Chinese suture, but it's not actually a text from, from um, all that time ago.

Speaker 1:          17:52          It's just kind of serving as an, as an illustration of this, um, this environment. Um, so you look at that and you think, okay, this is surprising because translation here is, is being done by a group of people. Whereas I tend to think of translation being quite solitary activity like this that takes over there. And I want to translate it into this language over here and here. We've got a group of people agreeing how to do the translation. And actually though when you, um, this phenomenon of crowd translation is much more widespread than it first appears. Um, so it's very obvious these days and crowd translation services on the Internet. So there'll be a translation company and you send your tech stack to be translated and two or three people work on it or more. Um, it's there in the way Google translate minds, lots of different tax in order to find the translations that are um, up.

Speaker 1:          18:43          But actually they are all the way through the history of translation as well. So if you think about the King James Bible, so this is the great translation of the Bible into English that becomes the core tax to the Anglican Church, uh, back in 1611. Um, and that was done by 47 translators, um, all working together. And the reason for that isn't just that it was a great long tax and they just want it to do a bit each. The reason for that is that they needed to agree as a community. And this relates to the diplomacy point from a moment ago. They needed to agree as a community, what together they thought the right translation of this holy text should be. And you can see actually how, you know, especially with religious takes where the whole point of a religious text is to be a tax that sort of is shared among a community that a community can enter into and all agree about, um, that this feeling of, okay, we're going to agree on the translation together, um, is going to be important.

Speaker 1:          19:40          And actually another thing that King James Bible did was draw on lots of earlier Bible translation. So, so much a composite kind of taxed. So that's another kind of big and obvious example. But actually if you think about what any translator does. So another example is Dryden, who's a, a, a great English poet and translator from the late, from the 17th century or pope from the 18th century. These are people who are translating from the classic striding is translating. Virgil poke is translating homer. Um, but they weren't just working from one lash text, the one Greek text. So pope had quite good Greek. It's, you know, but he was also homer. He was reading homer in a Latin edition that had Latin notes and commentary. He was aware of a French translation, whereas was wherever an Italian translation, he was using dictionaries. So his translation enterprise in fact wasn't just, there's one text in that language, and I'm putting it into my language is much more a matter of drawing from many different texts and drawing from many different languages.

Speaker 1:          20:45          And in fact, if you think about, you know, even if somebody says something to me in a language and I translate it into English, what am I using in order to do that? You know, I'm using all the instances of people speaking or the stuff I've read that my language, you know, my knowledge of language has come from in the first place. So the point I want to take from that then is the really ought, well, yeah, all translation is crowd translation or translation is always drawing on many texts and negotiating between many texts, not just taking one and turning it into another one. So here my, Oh yeah. So these are actually, um, these are the King James Bible translators. So all these people offering up the Bible too, uh, to King James. So that's the crowd of those translations. So here are my, here are my points that I've met so far. Okay. Now. Okay. So I'm just going to,

Speaker 2:          21:38          yeah,

Speaker 1:          21:40          it was for a moment. What's next? Okay, I'll put that up there.

Speaker 2:          21:50          Okay.

Speaker 1:          21:52          So what I've hoped to do with these instances, um, is just flesh out a bit. The variety and the complexity of the kinds of doing things with language that get called translation. There's always a question of discipline of right and wrong. When translation is in the room, you always need to think, okay, what particular purpose and context is it being done for? It's not just a language, it's got this diplomacy aspect because it's about bringing a text into a community and it's got this crowd translation aspect because you always know the languages that you know from many sources. So just want, I just wanted to kind of sort of add those perspectives. Right. Well, I want to do now is, okay, just seeing how long I've been going for. What I want to do now is think about the relation between these kinds of ways of moving across languages that we call translation and languages.

Speaker 1:          22:57          You know, because as soon as you got translation, you have to have languages. Or at least that's the standard idea. What does translation do? Translation takes meaning from one language and puts it into another language. So in order for that to be possible, they need to be separate languages. But how secure is this idea that languages are separate? Um, Derrida has an argument about the word Bible. Um, and it's in an essay called, uh, they taught about bell, the towers or the turns of babble. And he says, well, what language does the Word Bible belonged to? You know, it's a word in French, it's a word in English, it's the word in many other languages as well. So if I write the word, you know, you see a piece of paper like that with Word Bible in it. What language is it? And we don't know what languages.

Speaker 1:          23:42          And so if that word is shared between languages that shows that the languages aren't completely separate, I think that he could have made the same point about many, many words. So this is just a paragraph from my little boat that you've got and obviously I'm writing it in English. I was writing it and then I thought, now many of the words that I'm using are almost identical to words in French. Um, and they, they are. So I write the word identical. It's almost like the words you don't tick or right. The word paragraph. It's just like the word park off. I wrote the word pronunciation. It's almost like the word panels. Yes. So lots and lots of words in English. I'll almost identically shared with French or Spanish or Italian and other sets of English words that are almost identical. He shared with German. So there's lots of intermingling and overlap between these languages that we think of as being separate languages.

Speaker 1:          24:31          And it's the same with grammatical forms, you know, grammatical form that goes subject verb, object. I like the cart Jim to show. It's the same in across English and French. And other languages. And then as you move into languages that are further away, it all gets, it gets more different. So translation operates between, um, how language is related to one another is a very varied thing. So you can have languages that are very far apart like English and Japanese. So, and you can have Englishes that are very close. So what we're dealing with in fat is a whole landscape of language variation and intermingling and overlap. And what it is to translate from a distant language, you know, to, to the language that is distant from is quite a different challenge from what it is to translate between two very close languages like English and French.

Speaker 1:          25:23          Um, now why though do we think of English and French is being, you know, English is very varied. There are lots of different dialectal forms of English, you know, groups of people speak English in different ways or different technical languages. There's lots of variation within the thing we call English. So why do we think of English and French as being different languages? And we think of English and French is being different languages because they're attached to different political states basically. Um, so what, how, what has happened over the course of history? Um, what really started happening, uh, in the 17th and 18th centuries is that France and England saying started to say, um, we need to standardize our language. Okay. English is being used in many different ways. Words have being spelled in many different ways, but now printing enters into this as well. So printing over the last 200 years, as soon as you've got printed books, so famously Shakespeare, every time he wrote his name, spelled it slightly differently.

Speaker 1:          26:25          Um, and when you're in a manuscript culture, that's, that's fine. You can spell words differently. It's all handwriting. There's a lot of variety there. But as soon as you move into a culture of printed books, the idea that spelling variation is a problem in it, spending variation starts to seem like a problem. Um, and what happens then is that people create dictionaries and people create grammar books saying this is the correct way of spelling the word, the correct way of spelling. The word pronunciation in English has got a u in it and it's different from the way of spelling pronunciation and French ones yesterday one which has got an o in it. Um, so it's only as a result of that state sponsored process of language regulation that we think of English as being a language over here. And French is being a language over there.

Speaker 1:          27:10          And American is quite an interesting example of this. So there was a dictionary maker, um, in the United States in the early 18th century who wanted American English to be different from English, English, Noah Webster. And so the early additions of Webster's American dictionaries and systematically he chooses to spell words differently from the standard English spelling in order to try to make American English seem, uh, different from English, English. So what we've got here is, um, a, a kind of enterprise of, um, language. As soon as you've got a process of language standardization, this is the correct way of using the language that separates it from other languages. And translation enters into that because it's only when you've got a language that separate or a kind of way of using language that feels different that you need to translate in order to get into this language over here.

Speaker 1:          28:13          And you can see that the sensitivity is around that. Say for instance, they'll be film set in north of England where people are speaking English with uh, kind of, uh, you know, say a livable acts and unembarrassed dialects are ways. And then they get, you know, they show in America and they have subtitles or sometimes they show in the south of England they have subtitles. And then that's, um, people get upset about that because it's saying, what do you mean this isn't the same language? So as soon as you translate by putting subtitles there, you say, this is something you can't understand. This is something different from us. Um, another instance of this is from a pilot in the 19th century called William Bonds. We lived in Dorset and he loved Dorset dialect. And so he wrote his poems in Dorset dialect, which was a bit different from standard English, but he wanted Dorset dialect of figure as a language.

Speaker 1:          29:05          He didn't want it to seem like just the kind of minor variety of English. And part of what he did in order to assert this was translate his Dorset dialect poems. I mean you can read the Dorset dialect poems and understand them, but he translated them into standard English. And by doing that he said, look, Dorset dialect is, or language and English is another language so I can translate between them. So we've got this peculiar phenomenon that translation creates, enters into the creation of the separation between languages, which then bridges. Um, here's a really striking, very recent instance of this.

Speaker 1:          29:47          This is the Dayton accord from 1995, which was the international treaty, the establish peace after the, um, the, the war in the former Yugoslavia. So this established Croatia, Bosnia and Serbia, a separate national entities. And because it was an international treaty, it had to be written in different language versions for the different states. Because the conventions of international treaties is, you know, if it's written in English and French and English version and you have a French version. So in order to create this treaty that needed to be a Croatian version of Serbian version and a positive version, well the trouble was these languages are very close and overlapping and indeed they hadn't been through that process of standardization and separation that I was just talking about in relation to English. Um, and here's one of the translators that are talking about talking about what happened politically.

Speaker 1:          30:48          She says, look, this is a, one of the translations Vulcan called Louise ask you, I'm just gonna read it out cause it's quite striking testimony I think. So she's working for the multinational stabilization force and she says our language policy like that, all the international organizations in Bosnia fed into the devise of ethnic politics in the country by providing documentation and translations in three very similar but different language versions linguistically to members of the various language services had a hand in molding the three standards, which is to say what counted as creation and what counted is Serbian. And what counted as positive because, um, it wasn't decided already in linguistic circles. What exactly constitutes the standard, especially especially the Bosnian standard, the various orthography is, so that's books of spelling, dictionaries and grammars who was an Indian. Always agree. So there was always much discussion in this four edge Q language service on what could actually be included in a Bosnian version as against the Croatian or Serbian. So here we've got translators, you know, establishing the separation of languages in order to be able to translate between them. So this is translation as part of an apparatus of language regulation, which creates separations between usually national languages and standardizes languages within a nation state. And then you get translation operating

Speaker 2:          32:09          between it.

Speaker 1:          32:13          The interesting thing though, and this is um, where we moved back towards the literary phenomena that um, I said, you know, interested me at the beginning when I started, is it translation can also mix languages, um, up and Google translate is quite good at this actually. So the other day I got a, um, a spam email in German and I said, I put this into Google translate and it came out as in Germany alone, there are around 25 million science helped to make the road and to make, say for all road users and say that's not idiomatic standard English. That's, you can see the Germanic, the German forms of Sumach and kind of coming, coming through in the way the words are put together. Now people often kind of smile at this sort of thing and they point to that and they say that shows that Google translate isn't working as well as it should be.

Speaker 1:          32:56          You know, they call that kind of language translation needs. They say, okay, this is unsuccessful translation because it hasn't achieved fluency in idiomatic standard English. But the peculiar thing is those kinds of literary creativity that I was talking about at the beginning, the interested me right to the beginning, often do very much the same thing. Um, and I'm just gonna um, show you some couple of instances of this. I'm getting towards the end. Um, so this is, this is Dryden. The payer I mentioned a moment ago. So He's through the 60 nineties he's translating Virgil's Aeneid, that great, great poem. And this is just the first line on Marty widow and queer cannot throw a equipping them with [inaudible] and so on. And the way he translates it arms and the man icing who forced by fate left the Trojan shore. And you can see how, how the words are lining up.

Speaker 1:          33:48          And actually the way he uses the word, who there, you know, what do you mean? Who goes with man arms? And the man who forced by fate, it's not, wasn't back then either a natural way of arranging the English words and actual of arranging the English words would be icing of arms and the man who was forced by fade. So what he's doing then is he's taking the Latin way with language and bringing it into English. And this way of moving what reversing words and moving them around is something that is common to do in English, poetry of that time. But it's common to do an English poetry at that time because many, many people writing it knew Latin very well. And had Latin in their minds. And so you've got this strange phenomenon that what he's doing in order to write a poem in English is borrowing from lush and at word order and, and Latin at way with language.

Speaker 1:          34:42          So he's mixing the kind of thing that, exactly the same kind of thing that we've got there. That in that context, do you think, oh, that's Google translate or working properly. But as soon as you're in a literary context where it's okay to mess around with language, I think actually, you know, you know, the general point here is that that relationship between what we think of as a mistake in ordinary language use and what we think of as something interesting as soon as it's in a poem or in a literary text is quite, you know, it's very close. Um, here's another instance. This is from the early 20th century and this is Ezra pound. Um, and he's interested in finding ways of writing poetry that don't have regular rhythm and that don't rhyme. And one of the things that helped him to do this was an encounter with ancient Chinese poems.

Speaker 1:          35:33          And he didn't understand Chinese, but he was given the gift of notebooks from, uh, a Chinese scholar that looked like this. So you get the Chinese characters, you get English words underneath, and you get a kind of commentary. And he thought, okay, I can take, I can see here that there's a way of doing things with words as different from the usual way of doing things with words in English. And I'm going to try to write poems like this. Um, and here's the beginning of one of them, uh, which begins blue. Blue is the grass about the river and the willows have overfilled the close garden. And so what's unusual about this or what's different about this for many poetry that had been written before is, um, well not any poetry that, but what's unusual about it is that it's not rhyming. It doesn't have a regular rhythm.

Speaker 1:          36:25          And instead you've got this sort of sequence of word units, blue, blue grass, river willows, overfilled close garden. And he's arranging his words like that in imitation of what he understands of the sequence of Chinese characters in the Chinese poems that he's been looking at. You know, and there's also the strangeness of saying the grass is blue. You know, what's the boundary between blue and green is the evening. Um, and there's also the title, you know, the beautiful toilet. I think that's meant to be a slightly surprising title. And what it means is, uh, you know, getting, um, doing makeup and things like that. It's not actually, it's not actually a Lou. Um, just one more instance of this very recent one. Um, and then I stop. Oh No. Then I'll kind of wrap up. Um, this is from a writer. I don't know if any of you been reading called WG Sebald who is, um, a writer who's been hugely successful in English culture over the last 10 or 15 years.

Speaker 1:          37:25          Um, he's somebody who lived in East Anglia, um, he's German, writes in German, but it's very beautifully translated into English by a couple of translators. Michael Wholesale and bell. He translated this one. Now the kinds of novels that he writes are quite like memoir, autobiography. Um, so they're very located in a place, but they are also a lot about feeling out of place and a peculiarity about his work is that, say he's writing in German, he was published in Germany and then he's, you know which culture they do. These books belong in. So then his translation, the books are written in English, published in Germany, translated into English, published here and actually lots of the reviews and celebration of WG. Well in English literary press you wouldn't know that he wasn't writing in English. They just say, okay, this is an amazing literary style that he has an English.

Speaker 1:          38:18          And the interesting thing about this is that this style, again like the other instances we've looked at came into being through translation. If you just look at this first sentence and the second half of the 1960s I traveled repeatedly from England to Belgium, partly for study purposes, partly for other reasons which were never entirely clear to me. Staying sometimes for just one or two days, sometimes for several weeks. So it's quite a sort of decorous and formal and long sentence. And generally that's the case with his style. But it's also just ever so slightly different from what you expect an idiomatic standard English. I think if you look at the phrase, um, for study purposes and there's a German phrase behind that as a studio in Spec, but in English you'd say, I'm, I traveled repeatedly from England to Belgium to study, you know, and you apply for a visa for study purposes.

Speaker 1:          39:06          You know, it's slightly unusual to say I traveled to England, to Belgium for study purposes. And so what's happening here is that, you know, again, it's a very similar phenomenon to, to make the road and to make so for road users, um, you've got a Germanic phrase coming through into English, but becoming part of a literary style and what's cause you want a literary style to be slightly unusual. You won a literary style to kind of be distinctive. And so what's distinctive about this literary style is that it's slightly at odds with standard English. And that becomes part of the imaginative world of the books, which is so much about feeling displaced from, um, from where you are. Okay. Now the question, um, I want to end up with really is the, um, okay. So, so here we've got two movements. We've got a movement of translation operating between one standard language like in the Croatian and Serbian creating standard national languages, wanting to translate from one standardized language into another standardized language.

Speaker 1:          40:20          And there's a desire to do that correctly and achieve fluency. And on the other hand, there's this creative use of translation which changes the language. And in fact, translation always changes the language that it's, um, that it's being done into. But usually when that becomes visible as in the email version, people think, oh, that's a mistake or that's a failure to achieve fluency. But when you're in a more literary realm, that kind of strangeness is something that People Are, can, you know, people can get interested in. Um, and enjoy. Now, I just want to bring this into context into, into contact with, um, the way the world of communication. Um, it's changing because of the Internet and also because of machine translation programs like Google translate. So that I think a lot of the rhetoric around Google translate and similar programs is the aim to achieve fluency in a standard language.

Speaker 1:          41:14          Um, and one of the things that the internet does is spreads dominant languages like English around the world. But another thing the internet does is it makes visible lots of varied and dialectal and idiosyncratic, a nonstandard uses of language. So in social media and, and you know, also all sorts of kind of greets people are coming out with language that's, you know, distinctive just belongs to that group. It's misspelled according to the standard expectations of spelling. It's dialectal. Um, it's a mixture of English and French or it's a mixture of different languages. So I think there are two, two sort of movements in what the Internet is making visible or is doing linguistically. On the one hand, there's the idea of a desire to achieve, you know, fluency and translation software. But on the other hand, there's the making visible of lots of linguistic phenomena that kind of challenge that.

Speaker 1:          42:12          Um, and uh, yeah, so I think, um, so I think there's a, there's a, there's a question then, um, about, about which version of translation, um, which what's sort of language use, I mean obviously that they're both going to carry on being there, but how they relate to one another and how they get handled, which is to say does the creative kind of translation which relishes difference and strangeness and can be about me manifesting my particularity as an individual and achieving a particular kind of mode of understanding with you as an individual. So that's about people playing with language or people doing inventive things with language, which is part of what we do with language. And on the other hand as language regulation, this is the sort of need for clear communication and business contexts or legal contexts. Um, I, one of the things I'm interested in, I have no idea how people use Google translate, but the sort of assumption that things like that, that email our mistakes, we just need to move beyond and we need to achieve in I clear communication between different standard languages that it seems to me that's very much the rhetoric around her.

Speaker 1:          43:26          But on the other hand, I quite like, you know, that the Kuli or versions of language that Google translate producers sometimes, and I like the sort of, you know, there is different, um, translation possibilities that it opens up. So it seems to me this, there was sort of different possibilities for how translation is going to feature on the Internet, um, in, in the future, a more regulated version. And as it were, a more inventive and an archaic version. So I said, well, what the future is, is obviously going to be a world of translation, but what kind of translation that is going to be remains to be discovered. Thank you. Thank you for your attention.

Speaker 2:          43:58          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          44:03          thank you very much. We do have time for questions.

Speaker 2:          44:06          Yup.

Speaker 3:          44:15          Actually, I have a zillion questions, but, um, I, it seems to me that translation, um, is really important to the evolution of language because a part of culture that is, um, kind of carried on to other nations, whether geographically or otherwise. Yeah. And machine learning and Google translate today is not capable of kind of grasping those nuances that come with, um, you know, translation as we see it today. Kind of understanding what the purpose of the other is saying and trying to translate it into not like semantically the right kind of a flow with the words, but kind of like what you mean like the in Boca Lupo versus punching hospices. But, so I was wondering your opinion, what was your opinion on, um, Esperanto and that regards?

Speaker 1:          45:04          Okay. Um, uh, what I think about is Pronto is, I don't know much, I don't know much about us. Brand test is just kind of off the top of my head. Um, so what I imagined about Esperanto is the, I think the thing to ask about language use is that it's, um, it's always, um, there's a community doing it. Um, so, um, the, you know, how subtle a language is, how complex the communicative interaction can be. Um, all arises from what the community's like this using it, how long they've been using it and so on. And I don't really, do you speak at, do do you use US brand tone?

Speaker 3:          45:41          Not at all. I'm just wondering if it's, yeah. If a solution, yeah. Anything.

Speaker 1:          45:46          No, I don't, I don't think those kinds of things are, um, uh, solutions. I'll, I'll say why in a moment. But, um, my, my imagining about his brand too is, so this is, uh, kind of constructed language. How much of a history does it have or who's using it? And so it's a language that you use and then what's the consideration when you're using it? Is the consideration, am I speaking Esperanto correctly or is the consideration, can I play around with us? Bronto and indeed, I mean, I don't know if you've had these, you know, the, the common experience of sharing a lang, you know, communicating with someone who speaks another language and doesn't speak English very well and you don't speak the other language very well. And in fact, what you do is you mix up the languages, you sort of achieve a kind of local, private Esperanto.

Speaker 1:          46:29          Really. Um, and so I think the question for, um, I think so Esperanto dates from in the city before the Internet from, from, from a hundred years ago, whenever it was. Um, and I, you know, it's just a question of sort of what, what kind of usage, um, it enables really, but the reason why I don't think, um, standardized international languages, uh, our solution is the language is really got to two purposes. One purpose of, of languages to communicate with everybody. But another purpose of language is to say I, me and this group, you know, speaking a language that's different from that other language, you know, where my teenage kids, you know, use words, I don't understand. If they don't, they don't do it because you know, randomly they do it so that I don't understand them, you know? So it's about manifesting your identity. So there's a, so I think rather than saying [inaudible] this.

Speaker 1:          47:25          Okay. And then this is the issue about the spread of English as a global language. On a technocratic spread of English as a global language. What should we think about that? I think one thing to think about that is that in, um, defined technical or say business contexts, you know, that's fine. I think I said, okay, but what about English as, um, you know, just the medium that people are using to communicate. I think I said, well, okay, but what's going to happen there? And this is all, you know, this is obvious in the different kinds of Englishes that there are around the world. People are going to be using English differently. They're going to be playing with it. They're going to be mixing your top, they're going to be in. So actually, and this is, I mean, this is really one of the, this is the, I think, I think the big question, which is to say that, um, before the Internet, um, so actually, um, what I've been saying is quite Eurocentric.

Speaker 1:          48:19          So what I have been saying is quite, you're essentially so far, but so, so before the Internet, if you think about how print culture worked, the market for printed books was the night, you know, you'd, you'd publish a book and it would be in England or in America or in France. So you had these national cultures. It was all sorts of language variety in the way people spoke from related to one another and the word dialect or groupings and HB things and so on, said lots and lots of language for it. But I didn't become visible in print and it couldn't be shared and therefore it couldn't be shared nationally. You'd go to a village in the country and they would use language in a particular way, but that didn't spread, that wasn't visible anywhere else. And so in order to be widely read, you had to go into this, you had to produce a standardized printed text in standard English.

Speaker 1:          49:07          Well the Internet makes visible is lots of all the variety of languages that previously wasn't visible. It was just in, in spoken communities is now visible on Internet. And I think how people negotiate that is going to be really interesting to see. And I'm interested actually with machine translation software that, you know, the degree to which the ambition is continues to be, let's move from one standard language to another standard language will the degree to which it can say, you know, this is your way of using language in that community of a few speakers. Let's mediate between this way of using language, how it can, you know, the degree to which you can kind of register and cope with all the language variety though is becoming visible.

Speaker 2:          49:48          Yeah.

Speaker 4:          49:59          Press one. Hello Em. So Google translate is not aiming to make it possible for everyone to use English. Yeah. The opposite. Yeah. But do you think it will be a full similar to printing and dictionaries in helping to maintain a standard?

Speaker 1:          50:18          I think, yeah. I think, um, yeah, I think it could go either way. I think it's, I think it's just, I think that's about how people, I mean, I think it's partly about, you know, obviously I feel upset and trying to say to think about it in this room, but, um, it's partly about how it's constructed, which I don't understand and how it's going to, you know, the future of how it's going to be constructed. Um, but it's also about how, you know, how people use it. Um, and so, um, yeah, so I, you know, I can, I can imagine a developing in a way that allows, you know that Sam's an idiosyncratic nonstop, you know, that becomes inventive, that allows somebody to, you know, put into it and inventive use of language and English and for it then to generate various possible, different inventive equivalents in different Italian, many different Italian dialects.

Speaker 1:          51:17          Say, you know, I don't see why I don't know anything about technology, but I don't see why it shouldn't develop in that direction. So I think one can imagine it developing in a way that, um, okay. So, so you think about, okay, we need to communicate. And one way of community, one way of communicating is being tolerant of diversity. One way of communicating is you saying something and me being patient, uh, you know, uh, learning the words that you're using, the, I don't know, you know, so we can have a room in which people are all speaking quite differently, but nevertheless they are accepting of their difference and they've got patients to understand the particularities of each other's languages. And the other thing is, okay, no, we all need to speak standard English, so let's have a regulated environment and that's take our individuality and discipline it according to the Shad codafide standard that we're all using.

Speaker 1:          52:08          Um, so all language use is partly a matter of recognizing difference. And it's all partly a matter of establishing a common code. Um, and I think how, you know, I think how Google translate develops is going to be, you know, I don't know which way it will go. Um, but I really hope it goes on the more diversity way, but you know, in the, in the lats rather than let's only work between standard languages with a communicative purpose in order to achieve something that counts as fluency and correctness. And rather than doing that, if it develops in such a way, as I was saying a moment ago, that it's, you know, that you can use it playfully and user, you know, enjoy the peculiarities of language, all kinds of different language difference that it makes visible to you then that would be better I think.

Speaker 2:          52:56          Yep.

Speaker 5:          52:58          So I'm going to ask again about the future of fashion. Could it be different and go into their actions? So, um, automated versus the human part, English versus Chinas. So the first question would be what things do you think that cannot be automated? 100%. You think there's going to be like a human translator on side that is going to steal their forever and the second side, if we agree that Chinese is going to be the next big language, which bridges you think that are difficult? Uh, in this, in this side, we are in the Western world on the,

Speaker 1:          53:30          yeah, the first one. I don't see why you said I'm very aware that, um, whenever I do anything with language, I'm mediating between languages and words that have come into my mind. You know, that's where I know my language from. So I don't, you know, I think there's a lot of romanticism that says only human beings can do this and machines will never be able to do this because it seems to me that actually I don't see why a machine in the future shouldn't have the same, you know, so that I think that at the moment what a human being can do that a machine can't do is, you know, handle, you know, uh, bear in mind a lot of complexity and nuance and it, that just seems to be a matter of degree ready. So I don't see why in the future machine, I mean obviously I know nothing about machines, but I don't see, I don't see in principle why in the future machines shouldn't develop exactly the same kind of sensitivities as it were that a human being does.

Speaker 1:          54:27          I think it's just romantic to to assume that that's not going to be the case. Um, so for instance, my enjoyment of those odd literary uses of language that I was talking about a moment ago that comes from my same work. Okay. The normal way of using English as this. And there were various unusual ways of using English, this unusual way of using English as a mistake. And this other unusual way of using English is actually quite interesting and creative. And why do I think that? I don't think that because of some sort of special spiritual humanity that I have, I think that because of, I spend my whole time kind of weighing different kinds of language use and being aware of how words he is differently in different contexts for different purposes. So I don't see why a machine shouldn't, you know, develop that same kind of way of handling language. But I mean, obviously I'm, I don't know the thing about how machines work. Um, the thing about Chinese, um, I don't know Chinese and so I don't really know what the issues are there, um, particular what the particular issues are there. Um, I think, uh,

Speaker 1:          55:34          yeah, so I don't, I can't really sensibly answer that. Um, I think one thing I think though is the, um, the issue about, about script, about forms of writing and forms of speech, um, is, is really interesting and that phenomenon that there is in Chinese and related languages like Japanese and Korean, that they share lots of written characters. I mean, um, I, I can't say how, how similar and how different that is to an English person being able to look at a French text and being able to guess many of the words because they're written similarly. Um, but I think that's an an, you know, that's an interesting phenomenon, but I can't, I can't talk seriously about Chinese. I don't know anything about it. Thank you for coming. Thank you, Matthew Reynolds. Okay.

Speaker 6:          56:18          [inaudible].
