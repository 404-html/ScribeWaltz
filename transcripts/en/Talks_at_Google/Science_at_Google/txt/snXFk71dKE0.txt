Speaker 1:          00:08          Welcome everyone. Today we have such an important topic talking about lymphatic diseases and lymphedema for me personally today is incredibly important. I'm the chief medical officer at verily and fairly is the branch of alphabet that focuses on healthcare and life science, but across alphabet, our appreciation of both health and disease continues to grow. So I think all of you for being here today, the other piece is as a cardiologist and having the ability to work with docs or rocks and, and the crew you're going to see today has been a real pleasure. I think all of us will walk away with more knowledge and more compassion. So I'll introduce our guests and then and then turn it over to them for a conversation. One thing I will notice, we will take questions at the end. So please think along the way, uh, of your questions and we certainly welcome them.

Speaker 1:          00:58          So to my left, we have a doctor, Stan, Roxanne, cardiologist to professor at Stanford and you will learn and hear about his true passion, uh, for the disease we're talking about today. We also have Kathy Bates who needs no introduction to a academy award winning actress, a director and a philanthropist. And I think her role in champion lymphatic disease has been remarkable. And we have bill rich CP who since 2011 has been the president and CEO of a group called learn and learn has been focusing on individuals who have lymphatic disease and lymph edema. I should also note that he spent 35 years in place himself, so maybe he'll uh, he'll provide some color there as well. So thanks again. I'll now turn it over to Stan to tell us a little bit about what we're talking about when we think about this, this set of conditions, the

Speaker 2:          01:53          issue that we're going to talk about is a very important part of the circulation. One that is commonly not recognized because it's working in the background. And the problem is that medical doctors don't know much about it either. They should, but they don't. As I mentioned in 2007, I did a study of the 110 medical schools in North America to find out exactly how much time is spent on the system. And in a four year medical education we learned about 15 minutes. If you're lucky and go to a really good medical school, 30 minutes. I did bring something for show and tell, uh, just to show you how ludicrous that is. This is a textbook on lymphedema that we just re edited. Uh, this is what a well trained clinician should know. It's a thousand pages. There's no way you can cover this in 15 minutes.

Speaker 2:          02:49          We can't cover it in five minutes, which is what I've been allotted. But let me give you just a little bit of background. Uh, so the lymphatic system, I'm going to use the metaphor of a brick wall. If I ask all of you to imagine a brick wall and then a mat, and then describe to me what you are looking at. You're likely to tell me something about rectangular shaped objects that are overlapping, stacked on one another, a maroon color. And I bet almost nobody will tell me about the white mortar that sits around the bricks. And yet we know without the mortar you don't have a brick wall, you have a pile of bricks. The white mortar in the body is the lymphatic system. It is the part of the circulation that ensures that the local pond in which every cell operates, has the right constituency, has the right volume, and is able to support the health of those cells and the lymphatic circulation passes through lymph nodes and the lymph nodes help all parts of the body to communicate to the immune system when there is a threat, whether it is a toxin or a bacteria or a virus or anything that the immune system needs to respond to.

Speaker 2:          04:03          So without this vital system, without the mortar, everything will collapse. The disease that we're talking about today, the common lymphatic disease, not the only one, but the most common one is lymphedema, which is basically when the wall collapses in a part of the body because that part of the body is not functioning with normal lymphatic constituency. And basically we understand a lot about why that condition arises. We understand who's at risk for it and we have treatments for it, but the, the obstacle that we face is that medical practitioners are simply not aware. Let me tell you just a few of the contexts in which we see lymphedema. We talk about secondary and primary lymph edema. Secondary lymphedema means that you're born, your lymphatic system is normal, everything is operating well and something injures the system and you develop this swelling problem and this immune malfunction in a part of your body that is secondary lymphedema.

Speaker 2:          05:13          And the most common cause in the United States is being treated for cancer. Because when doctors treat cancer, they remove lymph nodes from the body, they irradiate lymph nodes and they damage the system in a way that renders it unable to function properly. In the world at large, and we're talking about 90 million people, it is filariasis, which is a, an infectious problem. It's a parasite that attacks the lymph nodes and destroys them and causes a very severe form of lymphoma called elephantiasis. Here in the United States, probably five to 10 million Americans have this problem. Difficult to know because doctors aren't writing the diagnosis down and if they don't enumerate it, we can't enumerate it. But by projection and by oblique references, we think that that's a fairly valid number. In that fiber. 10 million cases, there are perhaps 2% of those who are born with genetic causes of lymphedema.

Speaker 2:          06:13          That is the lymphatic system is malformed or it is, it is functionally incompetent because of the genetic makeup of the individual. Now, don't mistake inborn problems with congenital. Some lymphedema that is primary is congenital, but some appears in the teenage years. Some appears in young adulthood and many cases appear after the age of 35 even though the defect is present in the blueprint of the body from birth. So those are the broad categories, um, that we're talking about. Now, just to show you how ludicrous the problem is that we face in medical education and medical practice. I recently saw a patient, a woman who has pretty severe lymph edema, swelling and deformity of her limbs, both lower extremities, both legs. She was treated for colon cancer. She had lymph nodes removed, she had radiation therapy and for approximately a year and a half during which time her legs were getting progressively more enlarged.

Speaker 2:          07:19          None of the doctors would acknowledge that she had a problem and nobody certainly gave it a name. Eventually through back channels and talking to people and other individuals in the community, she learned the name lymphedema. She went to her doctor and said, I think I know what this is. This is lymphedema. The doctor said, oh no. That only happens in the arms to breast cancer patients. It doesn't happen in the legs. Preposterous. Not even in that 15 minutes did this physician learn that this can happen anywhere in the body because the lymphatic circulation is everywhere. Now Jessica said that she's a cardiologist. I'm a cardiologist. I got interested in this field because I'm interested in understanding how the circulation maintains its integrity and when I went through my training, I can readily admit I didn't know anything about lymphedema until I chose to embrace the lymphatic circulation as an entity for research and clinical care, but I think it's vital.

Speaker 2:          08:20          It is vital, not only that cardiologists know about it, but basically every physician who purports to take care of patients. So we're hoping that those of you in the room today and those that are watching this afterwards, we'll take a profound interest in this problem, which is global and it, the impact on the patients' lives is extraordinary. It's not generally a life threatening condition. It does not shorten life, but it certainly impacts the way in which those individuals could live their lives. So this is something we need to embrace. We need to acknowledge, we need to treat it

Speaker 3:          08:56          and eventually we need to be able to prevent it and reverse it. So that's what I'll say.

Speaker 1:          09:01          Oh, thank you for that incredibly impactful introduction. I for one, will continue to be a champion of the work that you all are doing. Kathy, you're here as a spokesperson for learning the organization we talked about and I think everyone here would really like to hear about your journey and how, how, how you have found the condition and what it's been like working with Lauren.

Speaker 3:          09:26          Uh, yes, I, I think I don't need a microphone, but, um, um, I, six years ago I had a double mastectomy and I knew what lymphedema was before I had been diagnosed with breast cancer. I was more afraid of lymph edema then I was of living without my breasts. Uh, my mother had it. I saw the effect it had on her left arm when she had a radical back in the 70s. Her arms swelled terribly. Um, I had a friend that I knew had lymphedema in his left arm. He, um, had had a melanoma underneath his arm and they took a tissue from the, the damaged part and reinjected, you know, so he survived, but his arm was extremely heavy. Like would, he had seen enough doctors in his life. He decided so he wouldn't go for care. And it terrified me, um, that I would get this condition sometimes.

Speaker 3:          10:36          We used to go driving in an RV and driving was very hard for him. His arm would swell terribly and we'd stop and get fresh, high ace bandages and, but sometimes lymph would ooze out of his fingers because he was so stubborn about it. Anyway, I was really concerned. Uh, I thought maybe I would have a predisposition to it given my mother's history. And I remember, um, on several occasions really begging my surgeon, please at the sentinel node is clear, get out. I don't want to have this, I don't want to have it. And, um, I had the surgery and when I was in the hospital I was feeling strange little, it was almost like an electrical storm. And I don't know if this is lymphedema coming on, but it certainly felt strange to me. And, uh, when I went in for my first checkup, he told me he had taken 19 notes from this arm and three from the other.

Speaker 3:          11:33          I am, uh, because of my career. Uh, you've seen me in raged Amin in several roles. I think you should multiply my reaction by about a hundred. I went nuts and screaming, yelling, crying. Uh, they, people came in the room to try to calm me down. There was a social worker speaking in that social worker voice. Now we just take a breath and I think I turned to her like the exorcist, you know, and I ran out of the building. I left my niece and my best friend and I ran out of the building in the middle of July, standing near the Beverly Center. It was so hot. I still had my drains in. I was holding this pillow and when I finally came to my senses, I thought, I can't walk home. I, I don't want to, you know, get any further damage. So I was really, really enraged.

Speaker 3:          12:36          And as he told my niece, he said, lymphedema would be a moot point if she doesn't survive. I don't want to malign my surgeon. He's a good man. His focus was on curing me of cancer period. And in fact, when I was having my fit in the room, he kept saying, I cured you a cancer. I cured. You have cancer. I mean, he believed that so passionately. That was his goal. And he felt that he had accomplished that. And I, I wouldn't be here today without him. I have to acknowledge that. So I was pretty angry for a long time. And then through one of my other surgeons, I got the name of Dr Emily Eicher and I found out I could go have manual. I did develop lymphedema in both arms and they began to swell and I had pain and heaviness and rashes and a heat.

Speaker 3:          13:29          And, uh, so anyway, I went to her very, very angry person and she was lovely. And she said, that's all in the past. Lao, let's begin your new life. She said, I have a patient who was 105. If you want to know about the stock market, call her. And she dresses in Chanel every day, so the future is bright for you. So, uh, then I became involved with Emily. She has lymphedema in her right leg and that's why she became involved in specialized in, in study of lymphatic lymphedema and lymphatic disease. So I began a program with her going frequently and then I was able to taper off. Um, and then Emily led me to bill for PC and, um, she said, I'm doing this one walk in Venice and I just don't know how to do this. And I did that. Okay. I figured she had ulterior motives.

Speaker 3:          14:28          Finally when I figured out what was going on. And um, bill and I met in New York and bill gave me the numbers that Stan has just described. And then I got really pissed off and I never have loaned my name to any group such as this over the course of my career. But I couldn't say no. I was so enraged. And when I, the more I learned about it and the more, the fact that doctors don't know, my goal was to raise awareness. And that's why I love the name learn. And I just, I thought, and I went to school, Dan, you know, when we went to Capitol Hill that first year, I said, what's the deal? Why can't we just go to Jama and say, get on the horn, talk to these guys, let them know what's going on, have them know what to look out for.

Speaker 3:          15:21          And we tried that. And you even wrote an article that got turned down in a couple of hours and under anyway. So it seemed like Everest to me and uh, that I would be going with APP oxygen all alone. But then as I began the journey, I was relieved to know that there are actually people and have been people for the last 15 years, working diligently on research, working on trying to raise awareness, working on trying to reach physicians. And today I'm relieved that that we are making progress. I left New York, we went to a cocktail fundraiser, a very wealthy couple, a woman who's very involved in research, my scoby Crosby. And it was fascinating to meet with her and doctor Diane who is doing a replacement as you call it, re reconstructions transfer. Right. And a doctor, uh, uh, Shelly Feldman, I learned so much from them. Okay, so get this. So they had a lovely dinner for us afterwards. And I had my best friend with me and she was seated next to a one. I wasn't next to them and it wasn't very well heeled group. And she was talking to the lady and she noticed that the lady wasn't eating her dinner and just pushing her food around and she seemed upset. And Jennifer asked her, she said, so why are you here? And whatever. And the woman just said, oh my God, now I know what I had.

Speaker 3:          16:53          I've had it for years. Right. And Jennifer was, so she's very shy. Anyway, so I said, where, where does she have it? You know, I wanted to know all the details for our purposes, but she didn't ask. And uh, but I was astounded that someone who had all the resources and the money to be educated and to find the best doctors had been living with this. Uh, and the one other thing, I don't want to take up too much time, but the numbers that Stan told me began to disappear. You have to, excuse me if I get a little emotional about this. The numbers disappear. And you know, when you meet people one on one and you listen to their story, you begin to empathize with what they have to deal with. And what I learned was from these people, I just met Rosalie today who has primary lymph edema and has it throughout her body for the last 30 years. And rose wanted to be an Irish dancer. It reminds me of Pearland Hines, who was one of people who emailed us, a young woman who suddenly at the age of 20 her leg blew up the answer just about to blossom. And suddenly her career was over. But instead of getting up, and this is what I love about this, is when you really get to know somebody, you see what they're made of. And after going through the horror, the denial, the struggle, she realized and she said, um,

Speaker 3:          18:37          I realized that if I continue to deny this, that the legs of future generations would be lost.

Speaker 3:          18:46          We have another woman, Karen Bingham, up in Nova Scotia. Her six of her siblings have it. Her father had had huge, huge legs and she didn't know what it was until the internet came along and then she began to realize other people are out there who have this, so she went on Facebook and she posted a picture of one of her legs because she figured, you know, a picture's worth a thousand words, and she heard from Facebook right away and said, you have to take this down. It's, it's, it's undesirable to look at. And in all fairness to Facebook, they have a policy about nudity. And so someone had complained that here's this woman showing their nude leg. I'm on Facebook, but things then began to roll for her. She posted this response on Facebook to her friends and they got pissed off and they talked to other people.

Speaker 3:          19:40          She developed a seminar for people up in Nova Scotia. She got local publicity. Then she got national publicity. She and I have been DME. She'd went to a gym. A doctor told her, just don't do anything for two years, lying in bed, and she said, well, this is not living. She did it, but she said, this isn't living. She went and learned how to be a real estate agent. Then she went to a gym that was hard to find. She finally found a guy who worked with her and she does kickboxing now and she is very vocal about what's going. She's joined our group. Uh, she's a wonderful spokesperson for us. And, um, there's one other young woman that I want to, young girl really to talk about. Emma Detlef son who's one of my favorites that I've stayed in touch with. And she actually came with, with us to the, uh, awards that we got in Washington to stand up. Um, she has it in her legs, was born with it and uh,

Speaker 3:          20:46          she at right went to the New York state legislature. She appeared there and there was a bill there that's still there, uh, that was languishing for research. And, uh, after she appeared it was bipartisan support and one of the, uh, Congress people there said, we have to help these children. And um, and then when I think she was about, was it eight or was it the same year? Right after that. She, Bill has a wonderful a walk run on the, over the Brooklyn Bridge, which I'm going to get to one day. We have ours in Venice and um, she had, she was our, uh, youth advocate, right. And uh, she wrote a speech and have to tell you she in those seven years because of the, uh, cellulitis, which is an infection that you can very easily, uh, have with any kind of a nick or cut, you don't know.

Speaker 3:          21:44          I've had it, I thought I had a very mild case of lymph edema, but Stan has explained to me if you got lymphedema, you got lymphedema and I had to go into the hospital and was there for almost a week and they sent in tropical disease specialist and put me on some kind of antibiotic that nearly killed me. And um, they just didn't get it. Um, but imagine being a child and in eight years of your life you've been to the hospital eight times with doctors who still don't really get it or believe it. She said something at the end of her speech that will stay with me forever. She said, if I can do something hard for me like walk back and forth across the Brooklyn Bridge, maybe a smart scientist can do something hard for them and find a cure for this in my lifetime, the people that I have met through this program, their courage, their struggle to live with this has been so touching to me. The doctors. However, I would like to encase just one leg in concrete.

Speaker 3:          23:01          It sounds like I'm going all Annie Wilkes on them, but in my business, imagination is the key. You have to use your imagination because only with that can you begin to empathize. Now, I won't put you through it today for today, but as a as a thank you to me for having been here today. Tonight, when you go to bed, just lie in bed, close your eyes, settle, breathe, and imagine that your right leg, your left leg is so swollen that it will never go down. It's like your, your leg is going to be in jail for the rest of your life. You're going to have to wear compression, compression garments if you can afford them. If they fit, you're going to have to buy two pairs of pants. You're going to have to buy two pairs of shoes. If fits in your right leg, you're going to have a hell of a hard time driving.

Speaker 3:          24:01          Uh, there are so many, just physical problems alone. They can seem daunting. It's psychologically debilitating, it's emotionally debilitating. I have talked to people who have this who have been, I use the word ostracized by doctors. I think doctors are so turned off, they just don't want him there. There's a woman in Russia, Tatiana, who had it when she was in her twenties and the doctor literally told her, you should be glad you have all your arms and legs get Outta here. So that's what we're up against. And that's what I've tried to do is to educate physicians. You know, if somebody who's notices I've got my compression sleeve on and they'll say, what is that? I'll say, well how long have you are? Cause I just want to take every opportunity and you just never know that you're showing me. You were saying to me when we went to physical therapy, one of the physical therapists there has it and she came out and talked to me and you just never know where you're going to meet people. So I thank you all for being today. I hope I haven't gone on too long, but it's such a, you know, just to finish up for me, who spends a lot of time trying to figure out how to be other people. It's really nice, although I wish I didn't have lived the day. It's really nice to be able to be me and to hopefully do some good in the world. The thank you all so much for being here. It means the world.

Speaker 4:          25:40          Take a moment.

Speaker 1:          25:50          I um, I have to say your passion is so evident and I can see why they call you all the Dream Team. And I do think this idea of empathy and sympathy across the board is something that we're all striving for. And thank you so much for sharing your story. The other thing that's very clear as I got to know bill recently, I can see why you were immediately drawn to learn and I think for all of us, it'd be helpful to hear a little more about your mission and I'm going to ask you to share some of the sentiments you were talking with me about earlier. When we have a certain entity like lymphedema, whether we call it a condition or a disease matters and your insights there were incredibly impactful. So thank you again for being here. Yeah, yeah, a real pleasure.

Speaker 5:          26:44          I get to follow Kathy Bates. How's that Tara? What? What's funny, I mean this team here, I mean really a faded to be. I mean, it lifted emo, lymphatic diseases have been ignored for a long time. Uh, when I first met Kathy, Dr Acres, the window first put us together. We met in New York and we talked for a couple of hours and Kathy was listening intently and at the end of the conversation said both, this is all fascinating bill. I have to have to think about it. I'm not sure if I'm ready to be a spokesperson. This is all new to me, but you know, we'll follow up at a later date, but I have to go right now because I have a TV show I need to go to. And I said, well, what TV show is that you're doing? And she said, well, Andy Cohen's watch what happens.

Speaker 5:          27:25          I did this. I said, Andy lives upstairs from me. And I ranted to Andy and the elevator yesterday and I asked him if he would be the very first member of learns honorary board. And he said, sure, belt whatever you want. And Kathy stared at me and said, that's the sign. That's the side it was meant to be. I learned spokesperson and that's how it all began. And kicked off a learned was established 20 years ago. This is in fact, our 20th anniversary. Stan was available. Doctor Roxon. Uh, right from the very beginning of it, uh, the way it all started, uh, a woman dealt with what women and families had dealt with for eons, but not taking the next step. She had a child, we had a primary lymphatic disease. Doctors didn't know anything about it. They didn't have any hope for it. They didn't know how to treat it.

Speaker 5:          28:15          She decided that that wasn't acceptable and began the process of creating this organization that we then focus mainly on the whole research issue because then there was very little research. So how do you get researchers into the field to begin really looking at this issue? By the time I come around, which is six years ago, uh, I come in and I'm interviewed for a job that didn't give the name of the organization or mentioned the word lymphatics. So when I got done and they told me what this was about, I actually turned the job down when it was offered to me because I knew nothing about lymphatics or lymphedema. That was not my background. I had a specialty and developmental disabilities and infectious diseases to some degree from working in Kenya, et Cetera. But this was unknown to me. After turning that job down, I went out and started talking to people and talk to some of the most sophisticated, wealthy as, uh, most educated people.

Speaker 5:          29:07          I knew. None of them knew what I was talking about until I described it and invariably after I did describe it, the response was my mother has that she had breast cancer. Her arms like this, it has a name, doctor's wife raising or like in the air saying whatever you're talking about, I've had it since I was a child. My doctor says it's called drainage issues. What became fascinating to me of why it went back and took the job, as I began to see the marketing implications of what was going on here, as as, as Dr Roxanne and Cathy have said, we estimate there could be up to 10 million people in the states alone that have lymphedema. I started putting the numbers together. How many people in the United States had multiple sclerosis? 500,000 how many of the AIDS, 300,000 perhaps a million or HIV positive.

Speaker 5:          29:53          How many have als? About 30,000 when all was said and done. Parkinson's. About a million. It turned out there are far more people with lymphedema then all those other diseases combined. How is it possible that we know so much about all those other diseases and yet this disease we know absolutely nothing about including most people who haven't, don't know that they actually have this disease. So a lot of our effort has been, is peeling back the onion of what are all those obstacles? Uh, well there are multitude. Dr Roxanne mentioned one right off the bat and that's the fact that if doctors don't learn about this in medical tool, they're not passing that information on to their patients afterwards. The fact that most of the people in the United States who have lymphedema have it as a result of cancer treatment. They're being treated by oncologists who very often their senses, I've treated the cancer.

Speaker 5:          30:43          Uh, if you develop lymphedema, find a therapist, don't complain, I saved your life. And unfortunately too many people have taken that advice and gone ahead and done that. We have the problem of the word lymphedema. It's a difficult word. People don't remember it. We talk about TB, Ms Als, how many people here can tell me what als stands for? You can't. The reason is you don't need to, it's too complicated. If you had to, it would put you at a distance from knowing anything about the disease. At learn, we start using Ellie and we use it pretty uniformly as as the [inaudible] an acronym for it. For it. I was saying to, we were talking earlier when it comes to, what do you call it, I think doctors, very often you, you need to feel very much like God considering that people are coming to you looking to be cure.

Speaker 5:          31:28          So what happens when somebody comes to you with something you don't know how to treat and don't know how to cure? Well, you have a couple of options. Either you're or you're not god, or perhaps this isn't that important. I think there's a tendency to lean toward the latter. I think using words like condition becomes a euphemism which softens the importance of what this disease is. And I was saying with Jess, I talked about very strong headed woman who runs a company with for compression. She has a lymphedema as a result of breast cancer and during our conversation I said, well, you know, really when you have a disease like 50 a month, blah, blah, blah, and she stopped me and said, what did you just say? I said, well, I said, when you have a disease, like I don't have a disease, I have a condition.

Speaker 5:          32:14          How dare you say I have a disease? And I said, well, you have a disease and the condition is a euphemism. What disease? Up in the dictionary there's a definition for call doctor rocks and have a conversation about it. I called Stan just you know, to check and make sure. Absolutely. Her response after that was, are you telling me I had the disease of cancer and treating it gave me the disease of lymph edema. Now I'm twice as a raise. I was before conditions. You just have to live with diseases you cure. I want a cure. I thought, well how fascinating. Even language like that can be a major factor in a movement. The other thing is, I met a couple of women when I first took this job and I said, what does it like to have lymphedema? And the first response was, well, build our worst things in the world.

Speaker 5:          33:03          And I said, well then I just made a huge mistake and I should be going doing those things, which are more important rather than doing this. And then they said, do you want to know what it's really like? And they began saying the things that Kathy just said. Okay, imagine you had 15 pounds of weight on this part of your body. You don't have the other part of your body. Your spouse never wants to have sex with you again. People mock you when you're out on the street, you end up in the hospital several times a year with infection that you don't know whether they're going to cure or not. You love to travel, but now you're afraid to cause high altitudes, exacerbate your lymphedema and on and on and on. And they finally get to the end of saying, you know what? Lymphedema is worse than cancer.

Speaker 5:          33:43          Cancer. The Cure. LYMPHEDEMA is forever. The whole idea having a disease that you have to treat for hours a day leaves you to facilitate it for the rest of your life. And although we do say it in, in and of itself, it doesn't lead to death. I mean, the fact is I get more memorials donated to learn because of people who have had infections that antibiotics could no longer treat who died as a result or people who gained so much weight because of their lymph edema, that would be it debilitated them and it caused, uh, uh, other things to occur that actually lead to a premature death. On the other hand, though, there are lots of things we don't deal with that we don't die from, that impact our quality of life to such an extent that we give a great deal of attention to.

Speaker 5:          34:30          This hasn't been one and a big part of our job right now is how do we develop that activism so that people come forward. I talked to dark Dr. Anthony Fowchee down at the national institutes of health and doctor [inaudible] was key during the aids epidemic and he said he went to Nih Beck in 1984. And at that point he said Nih was not very interested in aids. It was effecting marginalized populations. And uh, there was no, uh, excitement about necessarily getting overly involved in this. However, because of groups like act up, gay men's health crisis, et Cetera, that came forward and said, we are not taking no for an answer. Shortly after NIH began putting 10% of their budget, $3 billion a year into aids research, 20 years later, it was a treatable disease where people could live normal lives. Fast forward to us, we got Senator Schumer to put in a $70 million appropriations requests for lymphatic research.

Speaker 5:          35:28          The first seven calls, I called up the office where people saying it was a big step backwards. We were wasting our time. There would never be a cure for lymphedema and we were wasting our time looking for one. I was shocked that the population of people that have this disease had been so cow by everything they've lived with up to this point that they didn't even have hope. We need people to have hope. So with our organization, we focus now not only on research but certainly on education and advocacy. Actually a two of the people here from citizen group that rebranded our organization, we used to be called the lymphatic research foundation. Now we're called lymphatic education and research network and they helped rebrand from citizen group to give us the new name and expand our mission because we need to do it all. We need people to be angry.

Speaker 5:          36:16          We need people to be activists. We have chapters all around the world at this point and you'll see a little film that a a Kathy hosts about world and edema midday. We created world lymph edema day and the idea was we need more than awareness. We need research, we need it to be international and we need to make this an international priority. So learned at this point has a whole variety of programs that not only feed into researchers and doing research but also for patients themselves to educate them through a symposiums, asking experts, et cetera. But uh, also by allowing them to congregate and feel that incredible embrace of another person with a disease that they thought they were the only one in the world had. Cause it's only then that you get that power that one needs to know I'm not alone. We are empowered. We do have a right to aspire for more and we're not going to stand still and be quiet until we actually get what we are searching for. And that is we want new treatments and cures and that's going to take money. And we need government to support us in that.

Speaker 4:          37:20          If we want to win this fight, we need to stand together and educate the world. All of us who've had the courage to speak about our personal battles with lymphedema or making a real difference all across the u s even in Russia, Australia and India are stories or giving others hope as they realize they're not alone. I saw my day. I support, but lymph, the magic nice folder. I support, I support word join working TV Monday. I support, I support the name of the please. Okay, please. I am Kyla from Nigeria and I support the war amia. Yay.
