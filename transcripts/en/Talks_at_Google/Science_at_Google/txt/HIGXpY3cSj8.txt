Speaker 1:          00:06          Clapperton chuck in that some of Ungers professional interests lie in the history theory and practice of science, technology, innovation and entrepreneurship in the international context with a focus on Africa. He joined MIT as an assistant professor in 2008 after completing his phd at the University of Michigan. He is the author of transient workspaces technologies of everyday innovation in Zimbabwe. And his second book is an edited volume which we'll hear about today. Entitled what do science, Technology and innovation mean from Africa. Please join me in welcoming professor [inaudible].

Speaker 2:          00:45          Thank you. Uh, thank you all for coming. I would like to,

Speaker 3:          00:55          mmm,

Speaker 2:          00:57          start off by giving just a brief background to how this project came about.

Speaker 3:          01:06          MMM.

Speaker 2:          01:08          It's a progression from my first book, uh, transit work spaces. And what I was trying to do in that book was to ask this fairy important question. Why is it easy that in the history of technology science into innovation, Africa does not seem to be on the map, is a question that he does not have any technology or simply that it has been ignored. So as you know, Africa is a very big continent. 54 countries, uh, probably plus if you include the islands. And this is not something that you can just, you know, cover inside, uh, one book on your own in a short period of time. So I wanted to ask this question on a larger scale in these, was the birth of this book, take a closer look at the title, the major Eh, where there is from. The idea was to take seriously African voices, not just his empirical evidence or cannon fodder for theory, but is, um, intellectual agents in their own right. What if we took what they know seriously enough

Speaker 2:          02:38          to do that I organized in number of scholars, some of them mentors to me, others, uh, colleagues at the same level. Da, my Solo at Louisville, a shattering cheery Korea at University of Cape Town, Sheree or Gusto at Brown Katrine [inaudible] you live in runny egg lash, who some of you may know it. Rpi, uh, and then Foresta he's student, um, totally. Or do Masu and got it. Louis, both of them at University of Virginia, both engineers and they are colleagues. Nasima. So the idea was could we have a conversation across disciplines? Eh, I didn't want this idea of us just the science and technology studies, people speaking to ourselves. I wanted to open up this conversation to multiple disciplines. The bench sciences, engineering disciplines, lawyers. The conference that I organized in November 19th, 2014 was actually very eclectic is, and actually it, this became the actual title of the book. Uh, uh, we haggled over this. Some of you may know from publishing that publishers, one is set in type of title for marketing reasons. I said, no, this is the title. Like I said, there's this persistent negative image of Africa, but there is also the agency of some of us working on Africa to escape it. Other stifling, uh, Western, uh, dependence on theory. Could we imagine science, technology and innovation from say, our own languages.

Speaker 3:          04:49          Okay.

Speaker 2:          04:49          I look at definitions of science, technology and innovation today and I'm sure you would agree that they are very reductionist science comes to be, eh, removed from a all kinds of social dimensions. But as we know, science itself is a social activity. The idea was to restore that and see where we would get in Africa for example, it's impossible to reckon with any major innovation without ticking seriously religious aspects that under good the ritual of knowledge production. The same for technology. If you look at technology today, it's as if it's just a technical gadgets. Um, and I'm seeing they said Google, um, but it's a whole complex systems, social, technical, cultural, etc. Etc. My interest was to restore that, but all sorts of disturb the meaning of technology. Is it that obvious or could it be something more? Could it be that we are in being in reducing it to gadgets we are missing out on something else?

Speaker 2:          06:09          What could that something else be the same with, um, if you look at innovation, innovation has been reduced to this very commercialized tech, techno centric, uh, rearm. So what are we, what are we to do with those activities that people engage with that fall outside that now, why did these conversations or care when they did, this was just a year before I got tenure at 2015 and I was beginning to be frustrated by the insula way in which academia engages with questions of the world. Um, and so I began to engage policy makers. For example, could I see myself playing a role making interventions in policy?

Speaker 3:          07:07          Okay.

Speaker 2:          07:07          I had been conducting research since 2008 on what I call everyday knowledge. That knowledge that sustains people when, uh, the, our Nice Gary as a here, Eh, when people don't have those careers, they never went to school or if they were fired from work. Many of these people in Africa, going back to what is now called informal sector or the informal economy, what under girds the informal activity, uh, these skills that you need to go by every day. Most of them are not in the curriculum. In the school curriculum. A good number of them actually dismissed, uh, traditionally is primitive or simply and knowledgeable.

Speaker 2:          08:01          So I see they started this 2000 and this project 2008 by then I had already began to hear this talk. Africa is rising, Eh, you seeing a new young African who is quite driven to make a difference. The, there is one generation that still says colonialism is to blame for all our eels theater now that says no, no, no. We have been independent for a while. Could this nonsense, this generation that I am talking about, the younger generation, I felt they needed a different kind of narrative about African deeply rooted in history but also tackling the key, uh, keywords in their own time. Like tech, like science, like innovation, like entrepreneurship.

Speaker 3:          08:59          Okay.

Speaker 2:          08:59          And yet when you look at Africa's history is a blank slate. Historians have you, not that anthropologists, yeah, they are beginning to come round to it is for engineering, science and tech. They don't deal with that stuff.

Speaker 3:          09:14          Okay.

Speaker 2:          09:14          So each nation subsists on its own meats and to heroes. What kind of euros with this generation subsystem.

Speaker 3:          09:25          Okay.

Speaker 2:          09:26          That's the busiest for, I'm writing this book. It was intended for what? Since the book was published. He has now, uh, image, the clearly in my mind is a project of training critical thinkers. Doers.

Speaker 3:          09:46          Okay.

Speaker 2:          09:47          In other words is to see that Africa is a load of critical thinkers, but most of them are not. Do us and those that actually do things are not critical thinkers. So how do you bring these two and square the circle.

Speaker 3:          10:06          Okay.

Speaker 2:          10:07          The research that I had done since both during and since Phd, he had taught me that the best way to be effective in the world is to be humble before knowledge to not appear like you monopolize the space of common sense and reason.

Speaker 3:          10:28          Yeah.

Speaker 2:          10:28          And that was coming from being at MIT is in academic. And what I learnt in my fieldwork and through growing up was a lot of knowledge that is handed down from generation to generation through practice.

Speaker 3:          10:46          Okay.

Speaker 2:          10:46          And part of this required me to have to really look at Africa in a different light is somebody was coming back from years in the diaspora.

Speaker 3:          10:59          Okay.

Speaker 2:          10:59          I found that one of the most underestimated strengths, the most underrated, eh, acids of Africa is what one would call creative resilience. Where even when people's backs are against the wall, they don't just die, roll over and die. They die fighting. And so that creative spirits is often take ignored. People just talk about, oh Africa's people are very resilient. Look at what is thrown at them.

Speaker 3:          11:32          Okay.

Speaker 2:          11:33          No, it's not just the resilience, it's also creativity. You can be resilient or all you want, but if you are faced with hunger in death, you have to innovate.

Speaker 3:          11:46          Okay.

Speaker 2:          11:47          The concern for me was that a lot of what is what we are seeing now, uh, in the context in terms of innovation arises out of trying to make due to deal with a very tough situation. So let me take you through the individual chapters in the process of answering this question. What do science, technology and innovation mean from Africa? I have seen that I held him, Eh, W I convened a meeting at Mit in 2014 I had also organized the previous one in South Africa to recast the idea of laboratory.

Speaker 3:          12:34          Okay.

Speaker 2:          12:34          Why recast it? Because I don't believe that the built laboratory is the only laboratory that exists. If we limited to that, we are shutting out the door a lot of possibilities.

Speaker 3:          12:53          Okay.

Speaker 2:          12:53          Now where would you start with this? The first port of call for me was could we engage philosophers? We have been dealing with a lot of these questions about African knowledge and so in the chapter that Di da Macello rights, it's a very interesting example from Egypt. The concern for the afterlife in how it give rise to the science of magnification.

Speaker 3:          13:25          Okay.

Speaker 2:          13:26          And this discovery of [inaudible], which was used to preserve the body. And one of the theories, the advances is that this was the rationale for turning to not Ron in mummifying, a body or a preserving it in a fridge state was saw that it could travel the journey to the afterlife in a fresh state in instead of arriving the in a de composting.

Speaker 3:          13:58          Okay.

Speaker 2:          13:59          Now, however we may think about the belief systems of the ancient Egyptians is not the question here.

Speaker 3:          14:07          Okay.

Speaker 2:          14:07          Usually in the past, African knowledge has been dismissed. Oh, this is cuckoo. That can't happen.

Speaker 3:          14:14          Okay.

Speaker 2:          14:16          And yet when you look at the science that follows, we surely that's what we just take and say, okay, this is what we hold on to. The rest is rubbish. Muscle also touches on what is often conceived of as a primitive society in trying to find technology and innovation in that space. The Messiah of Kenya and buy other parts of East Africa and how they have been to both maintain salient aspects of designing spears is will is adopting and adapting some elements that are coming in. In my own chapter I focused on something different. I wanted to see if we can really think about science from a truly indigenous language and if we did that, what kind of keywords might we come up with and what I found was quite interesting

Speaker 3:          15:33          in

Speaker 2:          15:35          several parts of the of the chapter, I give the example of the way in which observations of animals and animal science give rise to a whole way of defending agonist, enemy attack in constructing defense systems. My best is mice is a rule. Mice always have a plan B. When they dig they have two exits. One is the obvious one. The other is the other you don't see, so they enter this way. If you wait here and think that the mouse is going to come back this way

Speaker 3:          16:17          and

Speaker 2:          16:19          you are already poised to hit it, oops, it has already bolted the other way it's gone. When he digs, there are all these various covens that it, it it highs in, so you may be digging this way and it takes a detour and just highs there.

Speaker 3:          16:42          Okay.

Speaker 2:          16:43          Mice are also known to be very good at defending against siege warfare. One example, I give the these, these tick and squirrels do this as well, but in this case it was mice.

Speaker 3:          17:00          Okay.

Speaker 2:          17:00          And this had very substantial consequences to the concept of Chimeranga. The idea that women would be stalking food in the caves while all the men who would be busy mounting the defenses. It was a communal effort.

Speaker 3:          17:19          Yeah.

Speaker 2:          17:20          What I'm interested is not so much the the war I tend to be until I am much more interested in the idea that you could learn a lot of things from other animals and I'm sure if you look at some of the science that that's coming out, like get skin for example. It's coming out of this idea to learn the animal world in order for you to apply to other papers is full shattered to query. The interesting thing was to think about the laboratory is a site which is not fixed or ticket to space. It's something that is moving. You can lift it and press it way. What remains constant is the practice. And for these example this, this is a stunning example of how you could actually build furnaces, blast furnaces in clay in order to smelt iron.

Speaker 3:          18:19          Okay.

Speaker 2:          18:20          And do so in a way that is capable of being shifted elsewhere.

Speaker 3:          18:27          Okay.

Speaker 2:          18:27          And I'm calling this science because how else do you explain the fact that these ironsmiths on the Zimbabwean plateau in Congo in the 16th to 18th centuries they out competed the Portuguese, we had come with their engineers from Europe to construct foundries.

Speaker 3:          18:48          Okay.

Speaker 2:          18:48          And the Portuguese, Lo and behold they couldn't Benatar. They'll hold the lock. Our market, in fact they did not even have confidence in their own.

Speaker 3:          18:58          Yeah.

Speaker 2:          18:59          Iron and then they deferred to this locums in order to continue to be viable.

Speaker 3:          19:08          Okay.

Speaker 2:          19:08          Part of what I find interesting is the way in which these ironsmiths we're able to manipulate air supply.

Speaker 3:          19:17          Okay.

Speaker 2:          19:18          To initiate combustion and control it to know what kind of trees were required to provide wooed with goods, charcoal and to be able to do so in such a way that they prepare the charcoal under specific conditions.

Speaker 3:          19:39          Okay.

Speaker 2:          19:40          That's science. There is no way we can go around it. That's science.

Speaker 2:          19:48          So I am working as one of the two activities that she recorded. It looks at the other one is Porterie. Porter is interesting because it's practiced by women, mostly women in Africa. I've not heard of societies where men are to be found, you know, making pots. No. If I had of until perhaps the, the recent times of any women smelting iron, both we're governed by taboos. If a woman comes near anywhere near the finish, the, I don't know, not come out nicely and the same time if a men came anywhere near where women were making pots, they would crack. That was the taboo. Production could only take place under these specific conditions. Nothing else. And before anything was done, these folks had to go before their ancestors and the gurus of, of, of technology. If you want to see this is what we are going to do.

Speaker 3:          21:11          Okay.

Speaker 2:          21:12          If anything failed they would blame the failure to observe taboo. Taboo may sound strange, doesn't it? It's nothing more than the kinds of things that you do in science. Science is its own taboos here the do's and don'ts under which an experiment is carried out.

Speaker 3:          21:38          Okay.

Speaker 2:          21:38          We often think of innovation is something that we all are free to and if you look at the narrative of innovation, it is usually this independent spirit of creativity and risk taking, particularly by the o think slavery. How do you innovate Eh, freedom or how do you innovate survivor or alive under bondage when your life has been reduced to nothing more than a machine of mass production on the plantation. That's the focus of of urea or gastro stopped. She is trying to reposition the Trans Atlantic trade in Africans is leaves, I don't call it slave trick.

Speaker 3:          22:36          Okay.

Speaker 2:          22:36          Is it technology transfer and innovation process? The argument she's making through seeds and medicines is an interesting one that it's easy to say they were carriers of ready made products from Africa or knowledge in their heads from Africa. That's easy to say, eh? Some scholars have said that for ice, others, for Mass Henri, others for mentors, the work of kindness, Gaucho for example, but what she's saying is that in that space between departure and arrival, enslaved Africans hit to survive. The only way you survive was to keep yourself with high morale. Of course there was also the possibility that you could recruit yourself from the space of being molested by your character and just jump over Borden ended and denied them profit. Yeah. That way still very creative and a difficulty comes in system or you could take only those, those resources that you had, there was nothing else to work with and shift them, inform, transform them in order to create something that would enable you to survive. So the space between departure and arrival was not a dead space. It was a creative space, what she calls the Inter Trans, the in between at the same time when they arrived. Picture yourself arriving in a foreign environment where you have to eek out a living even as you are enslaved.

Speaker 3:          24:36          Okay.

Speaker 2:          24:37          What she is calling attention to is to look at the slave quarters is an innovation space.

Speaker 3:          24:49          Okay.

Speaker 2:          24:49          I liked this picture because partly tills biography of me growing up where a lot of things were not, did not have space locally we, it was during sanctions and I saw the Rhodesian community innovating in very interesting ways, replacing imported parts with local ones that they could easily manufacture and when they ran their life they actually began to manufacture them locally. Examples include a lot of the Humvees that you see in the battlefields in the Middle East that are coming from Australia. Much of that r and d was Rhodesian met these auditions then migrated after independence. They did not want to have to be ruled by a blood governments. They migrated. That's one narrative. The other narrative that's interesting is that

Speaker 3:          25:58          okay,

Speaker 2:          25:59          if you wanted your mom to cook food for you, you had to make the utensils and it started to process it.

Speaker 3:          26:09          Okay.

Speaker 2:          26:10          In precolonial Africa for example, they will know hammer mills, they will know steam machines. The only way you could bow, you could grind grain and produce meal was to produce mortar and pestle. And what you see in this picture is a process it dad taking his son through the process of how you make one and to the point until you, your mother actually pounds a grain to make food for you. At Mit we talk of mind in hint, this is his mind and hinders. You can get the subject of total or the Moses chapter is an interesting one because you are hearing more and more. Now Africa being referred to is leap frogging. For most of Africa there was no land fixed land line then comes cyber, which by the way did not come. Cell phones did. They did not come just by the grace of God. Norway, they brought by foreigners. The first, the pioneers of cell phones in Africa, so phone or broads cylinder foreign to Africa.

Speaker 3:          27:36          Okay

Speaker 2:          27:37          included people like me, worldwide tare, Eh ou founded at telesales for us to have undersea cables. That Sitcom navigated the Cape. That idea was pushed very vociferously by former South African prison. Didn't tableau ambig his argument was simple. There was one slot reserved for hosting the World Cup for 2010 and it would go to an African country. No. Which guns would it be? Would it be Egypt, Egypt, last two funnels. In any case it was almost right on the path of the undersea cables going to India. The argument doesn't make, he was making was interesting. If Egypt gets the World Cup, I forgot it's lost its chance to have is a, you know

Speaker 2:          28:41          Internet each way. It is lost as jazz so the only way it's getting heavy it is if the cop came to South Africa, we now know that if you look at the map, the site by map of Africa, that is come to be, it come to pass. Since then we have seen interesting developments. We have seen innovations in mobile money with empaysah which is revolutionizing not just African, Eh, Eh, how African's movement. It's the revolutionizing the way the whole world does mobile banking and so forth. The latest innovation is by ziplining international in Rwanda. A partnership that is resulted in the supply of blood to difficult to reach countries using drones and by uh, and, and these is now expanding into Tanzania. These things have policy implications. For example, how can his sensibility of Africa is the center of technology sheep policy.

Speaker 3:          29:59          Yeah.

Speaker 2:          30:00          And part of the reason why we produced this volume when we did is because we were concerned that the strategic plan for Africa, the science, technology and innovation strategy for Africa focus is on big science and national systems of innovation derived from mostly European countries. Wu's uh, economies, um, science intensive. They are research intensive. By contrast, 70% of Africa's economy is generated, you know, the informal sector produced by that everyday knowledge that I highlighted earlier. One.

Speaker 2:          30:52          So part of what Chuck's done it was does, is to try and retain us to it. That kind of conversation. Can we have something more sophisticated than just cutting and pasting in closing, I've talked so far about a, what we did, this is what has happened since the impeditive now is to transform some of these findings into actual curriculum. So we have been turning the networks that we, we built through this process into silver by like this for example, how about we take students to these sites like this uh, forge here and taking seriously the science involved in this and combine it with engineering. What might we get? How about we take knowledge of grain storage under which um, Africans Dogg underground or constructed structures made of clay and he did them and after heating and it's cool they, they, they put grain insight and then seal it thereby ensuring that no weevils getting, what are we need to make up of that is opposed to using all these toxic pesticides to preserve gray.

Speaker 3:          32:37          Okay.

Speaker 2:          32:38          Finally I will say that one of the things that I've

Speaker 3:          32:40          been trying to do is to demystify the purpose of education. And this is an admitted that is dear to my heart. When we are educated, we leave the villages with the communities and go abroad. We never come back and many of these insights as good as they were, they were produced by academics and these academics. What do we do? Does it just end in talk? I said earlier that Africa is a huge deficits of doers, a lot of critical thinkers. We're not do us a lot of doers. We're not critical thinkers. The challenge personally was what have I ever done because I want to change the whole of Africa. I want to change the world. What if I ever really done for my own little village? And so I wanted to challenge fill academics who come from Africa to say, can't we be catalysts and builders? So I returned to home, remodeled my own homestead into a kind of laboratory where I could try out if I had ideas that I thought worked, why not try the about face to see if they work before I can propose them to governments. I can just talk from, that's empty rhetoric.

Speaker 3:          34:11          Okay.

Speaker 2:          34:12          And as you spend substantial presence in the village, you realize that actually people where they work every day, these are their own laboratories. Like this young man here who told me that if you want to see if one fertilizer works amount three of them just to plant three crops, right? Three plants, right? One, two, three. And then put the same amount of fertilizer on each.

Speaker 3:          34:44          Okay,

Speaker 2:          34:45          three different. The one that grows more is justified itself is the better option

Speaker 2:          34:54          so you could come to that space is a learner and not just somebody who's telling people what to do. Finally, there is a concept that I talk about in the introduction coach an under which this society came together to do communal work, the whole village to do community work for women who are widowed for orphans or those that were too old to do work or simply for those that had excelled and go to overwhelmed by their own crop production. It's called Nimby. It's an ethos of collective work. The idea that I was bringing back was, can't we do this again but this time focusing on self development in the village, the picture, you'll see what's ticking this morning. Ets, it peaked ya off. US electrifying our own village using that concept. It's not easy. There will be people who are still very individualistic but you just didn't out. Once you cut off the rough edges, it has turned out to be a very, very successful model. Thank you very much for listening.

Speaker 3:          36:29          Okay.

Speaker 4:          36:32          You reminded me of an, excuse me, an experience I had recently with the community garden. Um, it is, uh, near here. It is not individual plots where people in the community, it has done communally as a group and many of the people in that maybe be most in that group are engineers and a lot of the engineers from MIT. And uh, I learned from there that farmers in the u s at least in the western world don't innovate.

Speaker 2:          37:05          Hmm.

Speaker 4:          37:06          The industry of selling them products does the development, the innovation and sells them answers to their questions basically. Um, so they don't ask questions at all of themselves, but clearly in a village you get this sense of being not just empowered but, but required to ask an answer your own questions or they will never be known. Um, it seems a natural thing for a village environment or a, um, a group large enough to be able to differentiate who is doing what work, but small enough that everyone is an individual and everyone can hear what one person has to say to, to do that kind of innovation, um, to learn perhaps that one other kinds of one kind of tree blocks the wind a better when the wind is making it difficult for young, young plants. Yeah. Um, so thank you for bringing that to light, but very much clicked with me based on my personal experience.

Speaker 2:          38:08          Thank you so much.

Speaker 1:          38:10          I'm curious if, if you see one particular nation in Africa or a particular city or region, um, as the most likely to sort of export the next world changing technology or, or if that doesn't really matter so much and if, if you're more focused on some of the work you've shared today that really has low direct local impact in communities,

Speaker 2:          38:32          Rwanda, Rwanda. Because if you look at what a President Paul, I mean, is doing, he's willing to take risks. I was very impressed by the story that, Eh, the, Eh, killer Rinaldo from Ziploc and told me he was saying that everybody else, yes. Laughter. Boff basic garden even, you know, the big pharmaceutical companies, uh, the big foundations in the United States, uh, let alone government, they just said, yeah, crazy little boy get out of here. But [inaudible] was prepared to take the risk and they buy loaded that the first, it's a world's first actually. So that'll needs on what's happening is very interesting where you already have done better. So that to see nothing awful shade. Now one could say, oh, but these people are coming from outside or the big corporations in the kids that are doing this. But why is it that it's possible in Africa and what kind of infrastructures are they creating?

Speaker 2:          39:48          Zip Line is very interesting. Where it goes next will be critical. So I would say Wanda, without any doubt. Second do, which would be malicious. Uh, I think the big innovation will be in problem solving. Education. Uh, you have two institutions. One in Maritia scald African leadership academy. They now university. Um, and they uh, modeling their education system is declaring you declare a student declares not a major but emission and one of their missions is to solve global challenges. I she had seen in Ghana is doing the same thing I think differently though, but I would watch the one in Mauritius.

Speaker 5:          40:47          I work on education initiatives at Google. I was wondering if you could provide a little bit more specific information about those examples that you just mentioned where there are these educational models around mission, right. Rather than knowledge for the sake of knowledge. Where can I go and learn more information about that?

Speaker 2:          41:09          Um, they, so the thing with with, with upper leadership university is that there is a big vision and they have started that journey to get there and they are on a big recruitment drive. That's how I go to know that in the interest of full disclosure, what interests me about them is that they are willing to gamble, take big risks and start entirely something new. They are not interested in settled waters because you know when the water is crystal create, you will see where the crocodile is. They are prepared to plunge in and gamble that the crocodiles will see that they are too brave. They must be banking on something and back off. So their website is a good start, but they are very approachable. In terms of Fred, you got this founder himself is very, very approachable. They are mixing this corporate style of doing things with, I can't say traditional way of delivering education, but that's that corporate style is interesting because when he has a vision, he can push it forward. Please join me again and thank you, professor Malanga. Thank you so much.
