Speaker 1:          00:00:06       Without further ado, please help me. Welcome Joe. Thank you.

Speaker 1:          00:00:14       So thank you. Thank you, Mary for the, for the great introduction texts that everybody at Google. And also I wanted to take my longtime colleague, Terry Fong, who kind of, uh, with along with Mary manages the, the NASA Google relationship for inviting me to give this presentation. So I'm, I'm, I'm thrilled to be here. This is actually my first time on the, on the Google campus. And so I've obviously everybody has read and heard a lot about it, but to actually see it in action is, is wonderful for me. Um, I'm going to talk a little bit about, uh, the Mars sample return mission. Uh, it's an idea that we've had at NASA for, for quite some time and we're actually ever so slowly inching our way toward, toward executing it. And I wanted to talk particularly about the technologies that are necessary to do it.

Speaker 1:          00:00:56       You'll see a few charts downstream. I'm going to show you all the video that's kind of an animation of Mars sample return. And you're going to see a few places where we're miracles are necessary. You'll, you'll, you'll, you'll know what I mean when you see it on the, on the, on the animation. And that's code for we need to develop the technology to do whatever it is that we're trying, trying to do. So when you'll see that you'll, you'll see that this mission is an incredible system engineering challenge. It's like doing Apollo with no astronauts. We even, it even includes, you know, going to another planet, landing, doing some stuff. They're launching into orbit around that planet and coming back. So it's very analogous to what we did at the moon wood with Apollo. But there's no humans involved, at least not directly. Um, and to, to imagine doing all the things that we did in the Apollo with no humans is, is quite an undertaking.

Speaker 1:          00:01:39       So without further ado, let me launch into charts. I'm going to try to run till about 45 past the hour and Mary will give me a cue to wrap it up and then we can, um, we can have a little bit of of interaction on, on a question. She went to a, and I also understand there's a number of people watching this online and I'm not sure if there's a mechanism for them to be able to ask questions, but uh, they, they can get in touch with me. Okay. So, so Mary are at Google. Um, if you want to ask a question and you're online, you're not in, in the room here, so let me go ahead and get, get going and we'll, we'll work it out as we, as we go. So I'm a little bit of an overview and by the way, my slides are going to be graphics heavy and texts, uh, light.

Speaker 1:          00:02:21       Uh, so we can, we can talk about the, the, the core stuff in a, and I have a number of videos that I want to show you and I'm going to, um, in order for me to talk comprehensively about Msr, it takes about four hours. And so we only have less than one then. So I've had to be a little bit selective and I instead of trying to like give you a shallow view of everything, I've chosen a few things that I really want to dive in and talk about it and I think that's a better experience for you and it's fun to talk about. And if you're still interested, I gave Maria a longer version of this presentation that has more information in it and you're welcome to peruse that and I have my contact information anyway. I'll give you a little bit of context for what we're trying to accomplish with the Mars exploration program that's in instantiated at NASA now.

Speaker 1:          00:03:02       And when I talk about Mars exploration, I'm going to talk mostly about the robotic exploration on Mars using rovers and orbiters. Obviously there's a big effort at NASA associated with preparing for humans to go to Mars. Um, I'll touch on that peripherally at the end of the presentation, but most of my talk is about doing this with rovers and orbiters and so forth. So talk a little bit about the context for for exploration and what is it that we're trying to accomplish as a blend of science, technology and inspiration and which I think is a product that we at NASA sometimes don't appreciate how much we're delivering that along with delivering science and technology. Talk a little bit about this, this a Mars sample return mission and then talk about some of the key technologies that include things like how we get the samples off the surface of Mars, how we kind of gobble up this thing that's a size of a basketball and Mars orbit and bring it back to Earth.

Speaker 1:          00:03:53       I want to talk about in particular a really cool application for superconductors to assist us in the, in the sort of trapping of of this basketball and Moore's orb is called flux painting and then I want to talk a little bit about the fact that the marsh samples, we have a love hate relationship with them. There are, there are Frenemies, I guess we want to study them and we want to bring them back to earth and studying our laboratories. But we also have to account for the possibility that there might be biological activity in those samples and therefore we need to treat them as if they're potentially hazard and not release these things into the Earth's biosphere until we've made sure that it's safe. And this love hate relationship with the sample actually drives the engineering of the mission. And I'll talk more about that and now, and then at the end if we do have any time, we'll talk about some of the longer term stuff like flying helicopters at Mars and I'm landing on a, on a pinpoint where right now we land with miles of uncertainty of where we land, etc.

Speaker 1:          00:04:51       So that's kind of the, the, the, the outline. So let me talk a little bit about, about context and I won't go through this point by point, but I just wanted to make the point that we, um, within NASA there are sort of four major organizations that, that are, are responsible for the NASA missions. There's one that's responsible for aeronautics so that one of the A's and NASA stands for aeronautics. Even though I think NASA as much more better known for the space side. Within the space domain, we have the human exploration and operations. Those are the guys who operate this international space station and are preparing to send humans to Mars. There is a space technology mission directorate, which as the name implies is responsible for developing new technologies that can be applied across the board and NASA and beyond. And then there's what we call the Science Mission Directorate in the Science Mission Directorate is responsible for delivering science results like you're seeing from Hubble space telescope like you're saying from the Mars Rovers.

Speaker 1:          00:05:43       And that's the, the, the mission directorate that that operates the NASA Mars missions. So we have, you know, countless journal articles and papers and covers of nature magazine and so forth that that have resulted from, from the exploration of Mars. And so we've delivered a really wide variety of key science findings like before the Mars exploration program began. We didn't really know how pervasive water wasn't Mars. And it turns out their water has been extremely pervasive at Mars in the ancient times. It was wet and warm and much more habitable for the kinds of life that we are familiar with on earth. And then something happened and all of that water went away. And Mars has now this dry cold desert. And because earth and Mars are kind of brother and sister in, in the, in the planetary family, it would be really nice for us to understand what happened to all of that water on Mars.

Speaker 1:          00:06:38       Why did escape and, um, if you're selfish and you don't want it to happen to you in Earth or maybe your, your grandchildren's grandchildren's grandchildren downstream, it'd be really nice to understand that. So science is a, is a big aspect of what we do. Tick engineering and technology development is another big aspect of what the Mars program delivers back to not only NASA but to the world at large. Um, many of the autonomous systems that are now being implemented in driverless cars got their start as NASA tried to figure out how to operate rovers on the surface of another planet where we couldn't have direct human intervention. And Terry is one of the world's experts in that field. And I hope one day he mans up and a and comes and gives a talk here at Google on all of the cool stuff that he's been working on with his colleagues at Ames.

Speaker 1:          00:07:27       I'm sorry for a little internal joke. Anyway, we were developing a whole variety of technologies that not only serve, you know, sort of a localized NASA interests, like landing more stuff on Mars, which is a very specialized application, but things that, that helped the world at large. And then the last one, and, and, and like I said it in some of my colleagues at Nasa, they want to talk about the science and they want to talk about the sort of technology as applies submissions. But I think that one of our greatest products is inspiration. And for me it was unbelievable to be at JPL. Uh, the night that we landed curiosity. And to see that in Times Square Times Square, it was lit up with the images that were coming back from Mars. And when those first, the landing itself was sort of a technological achievement. But when those first thumbnail images came back and we knew we were safe on Morris, that was a human story.

Speaker 1:          00:08:16       That was the story of all the people through their lives. And you guys know what this is like to work long hours, nights, weekends, and feel like personally responsible for the success. In our case missions, you're in your case products or something that may Google is trying to develop, but that notion that you've invested in yourself personally and something no machine can ever, ever take away that human inspiration. So I think that's one of the major products that we deliver. Coming back to science, um, there's kind of four things to organize our scientific exploration of Mars number one. And you know, these are written as if they're like equals, but they're, they're actually not finding funny life is the big one. It's the first among equals. That's, that's the one that, you know, if, if, if we were to find life, even microbial life, either evidence of it in the ancient history of Morrison kind of fossilized context or extent life, um, that would be just a unbelievable change in the way in which people on earth think of themselves and think of us as not being alone in this, in this universe.

Speaker 1:          00:09:16       I'm not to be downplayed or are the other goals. Like, you know, I talked a little bit about the, the, the processes and the history of the climate on Mars. So even if you could care less about as an ethereal discussion about whether or not there's life on another planet, maybe if you're a little more self centered or are thinking about the future for your kids and kids and his kids. And I'm just this notion of Le Let's not let happen to Earth. What happened to Mars? Understanding, um, how the surface of Mars, uh, evolve in the interior of Mars that is actually vastly different from Earth's. And one advantage that we have, the earth is constantly reinventing itself. The earth. We have these play, these tectonic plates. I keep moving around and changing things and there's constant upwellings. I'm in the ocean and on on land and things get recycled.

Speaker 1:          00:10:03       So something that's been on the surface of the earth a million years ago is almost certainly not on the surface of the earth anymore. It's been somehow turn underneath. Mars is not like that. Maurice has been very stable for millions and millions of years. So you have things that are on the Mars surface that have always been on the Mars surface. And from a scientific standpoint, it actually makes it a lot easier to understand the history of Mars than we, than we enjoy here on earth. And then the last goal from a science standpoint is preparing for eventual human exploration. And what we mean is from a science standpoint, understand the processes on Mars. It might affect human explanation and understand how the atmosphere works. Understand if as the surface of Mars is the, what we call regolith, which is fancy for dirt. The dirt on Mars is that toxic to humans.

Speaker 1:          00:10:45       So that was a big question we have when the astronauts went to the moon and it's even more likely to be an issue at Mars that that the, the regolith might actually include some things that are not healthy for humans to come in direct contact with. So getting ready for human exploration is a big deal. You guys probably know that you've been sending rovers to Mars. You may not know that we've kind of had three styles of these rovers. The first one was sojourner of which, which flew in in 1997 and it lasted about 90 days on the surface of Mars and it operated in an area the size of this room never got outside of that. It only could talk back to the base station that was nearby. So if it ever got very far away it would lose contact with the base station.

Speaker 1:          00:11:27       And it was, it was really a technology demonstration in, in 1997 so fast forward to 2004 seven years beyond that we send to, we sent twins spirit and opportunity. The Mars exploration rovers of those are about the size of a table and they way in the neighborhood of 300 pounds each when they land and spirit lasted for seven years before it got stuck in sand and the winter came, its solar panels can no longer keep it warm and we think it froze to death. However, Opportunity more than 10 years later, in fact, 12 years now has gone more than 40 kilometers. So it's finished a marathon on the surface of Mars. It was only supposed to last for 90 days and it always supposed to go for 600 meters and it's now gone well over 10 40 kilometers. So what I say is, Oh, we paid too much of that system.

Speaker 1:          00:12:17       You know, things should have died a long time ago. Anyway, but that's, that's how we do it at JPL. And then finally, curiosity, which I think almost all of you are directly familiar with. We launched it in 2011 it landed in 2012 it's still operating on Mars and it's one of the things that proved that Mars was in fact a habitable place because within its first two kilometers of roving, once it landed at Mars, it rove through a stream bed. And I mean it's like absolutely no, no questions asked a stream bed. So we knew that there was flowing water on the surface of Mars at some time in the past and it was direct proof when curiosity roll through that that stream bed. Just to give you a sense, we have not launched these guys yet, uh, to Maura's maybe sometime in the future, but I just wanted to give you some context for the size of these systems.

Speaker 1:          00:13:05       So sojourner or size of like a toaster oven, curiosity, opportunity and spirit. The size of the table. And then curiosity is the size of a, of an SUV. So it weighs 900 kilograms was about 2000 pounds. And if we're going to ever send humans to Mars, we now know how to put down a curiosity class payload. And you don't have to put down a metric ton onto the surface of Mars. If we're going to put humans on Mars, we need to learn how to land like 20 tons is what a human landing system will be. So when you had to increase our, our entry descent and landing capability but at 20 times. Okay, so here is sort of a quickie summary of everything that's happened since the turn of the century. The turn of the Millennium 2001 we've, we've started and we've been flying a set of rovers and fit we call fixed landers that that stay in one place and then, and then a series of orbiters that perform a variety of functions.

Speaker 1:          00:14:02       They all have scientific instruments that are looking down at Mars and asking questions about the geology or trying to do laser altimetry so we understand what's going on in that. Some of them were looking at the atmosphere around Mars. Um, all of our orbiters also do secondary jobs and include relay and communications from the rover. So if the rover had to talk directly back to Earth, that's a very challenging communication link. It's a lot easier for the rover to scored information up to an orbiter which then can transmit the information back back to her sleep, what we call calm relay, communication relay function, and also these orbiters. Many of the of the recent ones are equipped with cameras that look down and they look at places that we might choose to go in the future and they do what we call landing site reconnaissance. So they take pictures and they say, hey, this, this, I mean it's ironic from a, from a safety of landing standpoint, you want to land this thing on a nice flat rock free parking lot or from us.

Speaker 1:          00:14:58       That's not where the cool science is. A science is up in the mountains and so you have to find these areas on Mars that have both a safe place to land but also have good science and your buys. So what you want to fly, what you want to do is you want to land in the foothills. So these reconnaissance orbiter as a kind of trying to find the foothills where you have a nice safe place to land but cool stuff very nearby is the idea. And so we've been flying these things in this mission context since the, since 2001 a variety of orbiters. Most of them are NASA but there's some from other countries and including places like the European space agency are just collections of countries. And then here are the rovers. And then we start to get into the future of next year we're going to launch one of our fixed lenders called insight, which is going to explore the interior geology of Mars.

Speaker 1:          00:15:48       And then, um, I imagine that you all by virtue of being interested in space know that space x, which is a private company, is talking about going to Mars with one of their own unmanned systems that they call Red Dragon, which is an adaptation of the capsule that they are delivering to the space station now to deliver crew and cargo. So they're thinking when this chart was maybe thinking about going in 2018 just recently, they've adjusted their plant and now targeting 2020 is their first mission to Mars. And they, as you probably also know, operate, uh, at a different, in a different risk posture, in a different mission cadence than NASA does. They're much more risk tolerant and they're able to execute things more quickly than we are at NASA. And so they're actually talking about going every opportunity to Mars, which comes along every 26 months. We can launch missions to Mars. So I'm, I can't wait to see what space x is able to accomplish, uh, when they're, when they're in the position to be able to land on a routine basis of every Maura's opportunity. Um, now I want to transition to the future and what's going to happen in the 2020s and beyond. Um, we have a next Mars rover mission, call it, we call it Mars 2020. It'll get a inspirational name soon, soon. Please send, send in your, uh, your, your entries for that.

Speaker 1:          00:17:09       But for the time being, we call it Mars 2020 which is also a pressure ourselves to launch the darn thing. It's 2020 and not in 2022 and then we're thinking about what's next and what's next is very clearly and unequivocally Mars sample return in. I'll, I'll talk in the next set of slides about the fact that we need an orbiter to do that. And we need another lander that includes that rocket that I was talking about that launches the samples off the surface of Mars. And that's a decade of the 2020s. And then downstream from the 2020 is there's a lot more uncertain. We're not clear whether we'll have developed enough infrastructure to be serious about sending humans to Mars and the 2030s. Um, and so we're hedging a little and thinking about ideas for either more robotic missions that are continuing the science exploration of Mars or if we want to transition more to supporting human missions to Mars, which would also do science, but in a different, in a different context.

Speaker 1:          00:18:02       So we kind of have a number of pathways that that we could go in the 30s but for the 2020 is it's all about Mars sample return. Um, Mars sample return is not a new idea at all. We've been thinking about it since the 1970s this notion of not only going to Mars and doing in situ science with instruments that are carried on some thing or bitter rover lander, but actually bringing samples back and have wide variety of ways of doing that. I mean, if you defocus your eyes on what you're trying to accomplish and you just say, listen, I want to get a bag of rocks back from Mars. You can think about ones that have much more elaborate roofing systems or you can think about what we call a grab sample where you'd land, he wouldn't rove at all. He just reached down from wherever you land in a pickup, a handful of this stuff and put it in the, in the math and you and you launch.

Speaker 1:          00:18:47       The scientists don't like that idea by the way. They want a diverse set of samples that they have selected, not just whatever happened to be underneath the rocket when it touches down. Um, but the thing that I really love about this, uh, uh, about this slide is number one, back in the day when they were like doing these things as paintings, they actually still reuse things. So when you look at this one up here and this one down here, totally different concepts, but it's got the same background. So like somebody copied and background. The only thing I really love about this one is, um, if you can you see right here, here's the rover with all the samples and then there's the map over there and there's this big valley in between and you can almost like see this question more coming out of the head of the rover.

Speaker 1:          00:19:29       Go ahead. Oh No, you're on the other side of the valley. I'm I ever going to get there. So I don't know who made that painting, but they were not Amar system engineer. They were a pure artists. But I love that. I love that picture. And as I said, a variety of different ways of, of doing more sample return, but it turns out, but when you do defocus your eyes and think about what it would take to bring back a sample from Mars, um, there's kind of four things that you gotta do. You got to get the samples, you've got to get them off Mars. You've got to somehow get them, you know, from that vicinity of Mars back to Earth. And then once you get them down here, you have to safely and, and, uh, without while maintaining scientific integrity, you know, you have to study them.

Speaker 1:          00:20:11       So these four functions are totally independent of any particular architecture. Um, and then as we'd like to do at NASA, we like to split big problems into small problems. You start thinking about functions. These are thinking about what elements might be able to execute. So in the color coding before we had these four different things, blue, orange, green and purple, um, and then you start to decompose these things into their, into their various and sundry functions. And you start to think about specific systems that might be able to do that. So for instance, this whole thing about getting the samples and both by the way, um, here's an, I'll pass it around. Here's what, here's a model of the two that we're going to, to stick the rock cores in and we will collect some 30 ish of these. It depends on how the mission goes.

Speaker 1:          00:20:53       We might collect as few as 20 and get still considered to be a mission success, but they go into this thing. So it's about the size of a cigar tube. The Model I have here is a purely solid model. There's, they're hollow for the real flight in implementation and they've got all kinds of Gizmos and stuff in here. But this is roughly the size of the sample. And the sample goes in the, in the shank here in the shaft. Um, so we, in this context, we envision a rover that would collect the samples. I would leave them on the surface of Mars. We're kind of like a drunken sailor. And then we collect a sample and we throw it over our shoulder. And we just trundle away. Actually we don't, we put it down really carefully and we take a bunch of pictures of it from all kinds of different directions so we know exactly where it is to go back to go back and pick up those tubes and we pick up those tubes from uh, from uh, another mission that that flies later than this caching system that will fly in 20, 20 as part of the 2020 rover system.

Speaker 1:          00:21:47       And that actually contains two major elements. One is another rover to go out and pick up those samples and return them to the man of the Mars descent vehicle, which is the rocket that flies on that, on that mission. So that mission carries a fetch rover and carries the Mavs rocket. And then we had this thing that's that. So you've executed the blue stuff, you've acquired in cash, the samples, you execute that orange stuff, you launched samples into Mars' orbit, then you come and you capture that sample container, we call it the oss and says basketball size thing and in return and landed on earth. And we have a variety of different ideas on how you might land on earth. But the most common one is that it goes splat on the desert in Utah and protecting that sample so we don't break the egg open and let the samples out is one of the major engineering challenges associated with this.

Speaker 1:          00:22:34       And then there's all the stuff associated with, you know, opening up the egg and getting the samples out and studying them. So let's back up for a second and, and it's, it will be completed. This was the first question that I asked when I, when I first encountered the notion of more sample return over a decade ago in my careers. And wait a second, why are we doing this? I mean, this is a very expensive way to study these samples. Why don't we just, if we're going to sink a lot of money into this, why don't we just sync that money into making better instruments that can get the same science that we're trying to get from our laboratories, but we do it at Mars? Well, it turns out that that's not really possible. Um, number one was at the, at the way that we do sample science involves, um, very complex sample preparation that involves either hands on or direct human guided slicing and dicing of of things and preparing specimens for spectroscopy or microscopy that we just don't have the technology today to do.

Speaker 1:          00:23:37       So we would not be able to study them as well using an Institchu instrument as we would back on earth. Um, some of the, these instruments are still the size of rooms and I mean, I know this is the analogous to, you know, room sized computers that now, you know, slip into your pocket. But the reality is in terms of space exploration, we're still back in the or or laboratory science for analyzing the samples were still back in those days where the, where the stuff that you need is the size of a room. It's not the size of a, of an iPhone or a Google phone. Um, lastly, you don't always know what you want to study and when you do it in situ, the investigations that you can do with your in situ robot is only as good as that instrument that you put on the system.

Speaker 1:          00:24:27       Whereas if you bring a sample back, it can sit in containment for 20 years and all of a sudden you've got a new instrument that's able to do analysis that we never could do when we first flew the mission. And that's the case with the Apollo Moon rocks. They're, they're, they're, they're housed largely at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas. And then they're distributed out to investigators. And one of the motivations for the distribution of these things are new instrument capabilities that have come a long, long past when those samples came back from the moon. So there's, there's ample motivation, um, to not try to do sample, you know, to not try to replace the sample return mission with Jess in situ exploration. Here's a trying to summarize this sort of three mission context, but actually then the next video animation. I'm going to show you guys as much better at doing this job.

Speaker 1:          00:25:16       We call this a bad chart because earth is on the bottom. Mars is on the top and if we really did this correctly, we would be hanging the, the rover upside down, um, showing that it's all being done on Mars. But you see the sort of three mission thing, Mars 2020 collect sample tubes. You can fly the orbiter and the, and the lander mission in either order, it doesn't much matter, but you have to retrieve the tubes, launch them into Mars' orbit, collect them and bring them back to Earth. And hopefully if this video works well,

Speaker 2:          00:25:47       if we want to understand the potential for life elsewhere in the solar system, our neighboring planet, Mars is a great place to go. Waiting on Mars or rock samples that hold clues to whether Mars ever had an environment suitable for small lifeforms called microbes. Scientists would love to collect these special rocks and bring them back to study up close in laboratories here on earth. However you tackle it. Returning samples from Mars is definitely a complicated problem, but mission planners are already testing technologies to make the future possible, so how can we actually get a sample for Mars? Mission planners have several ideas. One is to build three different spacecraft, which would work together like a relay team. The first rover could touch down on the Martian surface and collect samples by drilling into rocks and then stashing the samples and sealed tubes. Once collected, the samples would be placed on the surface to wait for pickup.

Speaker 2:          00:26:43       A second rover sent later this follow on rover would go fetch the samples, load them into a container and bring it back to a lander with a small rocket onboard. Once the container was loaded on board, the rocket would lift off carrying the samples up into Mars' orbit. Waiting in orbit would be a third spacecraft and more butter that could capture the container and bring it back to her with Mars samples safely back on earth scientist around the world. We'll be able to study them in state of the art laboratories for decades to come. The payoff of a sample return is learning about the potential for life beyond our home planet and even whether Mars has the right environment and resources for human explorers to survive there one day.

Speaker 1:          00:27:39       Okay. So that's MSR in a, in a nutshell with a few, a few miracles mixed in. So, so you guys may think you have coal jobs. I got the coolest job. Okay. They pay me to develop the technologies to be able to do more sample return. Like I, I find myself on a daily basis going, I just got paid all day to think about Mars Rovers and they asked me to come back tomorrow and they're gonna pay me again tomorrow or I'm so lucky. Um, we've had sort of three domains and in a technology development program and so I'm going to delve much more down into the details now, um, of, of technologies to enable Mars sample return in the 2012 to 2014 timeframe. We were really trying to get that 2020 rover enabled to be able to collect the samples. So we were working hard to develop, you know, the drill that was going to drill the sample and not, you know, turn it into powder, but keeping it on an integral core.

Speaker 1:          00:28:37       We want it to do what we call faster viewers, which is making it sound as the rover can cover hundreds of meters per day instead of the tens of meters that we typically do with our Mars rovers today. And we also, um, wanted to be able to land more precisely right now. Um, the, uh, the MSL mission, the curiosity mission, the what we call the landing error lifts for that was about 10 kilometers by eight kilometers. And we want to get down to much closer ones because we can, as I was saying before, we want to land close to where the good science is. So we had to, within the case of MSL, we got to row for a couple of years before we really got to um, to the good science. We were fortunate to encounter that stream bed on the way, but the, the actual intention for that mission, we didn't achieve that until we had road for two years.

Speaker 1:          00:29:24       So we're trying to be able to reduce the size of that landing error lips and land much more precisely. Um, those, the reason that this is green here is that those technologies were developed to the level that they were able to be infused into the flight mission and there was all being integrated into the Mars 2020 mission. And so we'll have all those capabilities that we didn't have four for MSL. The stuff that's in yellow is in development. Now I'm going to talk to much, much more extensively about that in there and the remaining minutes that we have have left to develop the math to develop containment assurance. And then, um, eventually we're going to have to develop whatever that system is a comes and lands the samples back back on earth and doesn't let the, the egg break open. And then way down stream we'll start developing technologies that are not related to, to MSR.

Speaker 1:          00:30:09       And I'm really going to talk about MSR today. So there's a variety of technologies necessary. I've touched on a few of them already. Um, so I won't spend too much time on this slide, but just realize many of them sort of serve more than one mission in particularly in the sense that there's two rovers involved in the sample return architecture. Here's what 2020 is all about. It's highly based on the curiosity platforms. So it actually looks very similar to to curiosity and in fact it was made from some of the spares from the curiosity mission. That's one of the ways we kept a mission costs down. Um, but it has a completely different science package on it that's more oriented toward trying to find evidence of, um, of life on Mars and collect those, those samples. Um, it looks identical and certainly the architecture of the flight system is the same.

Speaker 1:          00:30:59       We had this crew stage, that shepherds vehicle from Earth to Mars. We have a back show, which is kind of a cover that covers the, the good stuff inside the payload during the entry into Mars. Then we have this descent stage that you all have seen that that lowers the rover down to the surface and then flies away. The rover itself kind of collapsed down into Intuit's flat condition before the wheels are deployed. And in the bottom is the heat shield. That's all the same between MSL and 2020 and it's really just the payload is on the rover. That's, that's dramatically different. That's what it looks like when it's all put together in the clean room at JPL. Um, and then as I mentioned before, we had these key technologies that we infuse it, the mission. So we have this model for technology development. I mean it's really common across an asset technology development then infusion into, into a target mission application.

Speaker 1:          00:31:53       Um, as I said before, we were trying to narrow that, that landing error lips in the way that we do it for, for 2020. That's different from MSL cause we had this things called terrain relative navigation. Um, it just didn't come up really in any of the sort of public discussions about curiosity. But curiosity really didn't know very much about where it was landing. We targeted a particular location and we did our best and navigated through our best to put the spacecraft there and it landed very close and I ended within a kilometer of where we were targeting, which is fantastic, but we didn't have any ability to fly the vehicle to in a particular direction. And once we actually had it underneath the parachute, it's like you pop the shoot and you're going to land wherever you land. This is a is intending to allow you to at least adjust the direction that we go.

Speaker 1:          00:32:42       So we come down, we take 10 quick pictures on the way down and then we decide what direction we're going to ask the vehicle to go and we have a divert capability that's measured in the hundreds of meters for this. So this is exaggerating the situation won't, it won't keep us from living in the mountains, but in Atlanta it's in a, in a, in a more, in a direction that's more safe. And then I've been alluding to this notion that we have a variety of these sample tubes are going to lay down. We were going to fly about 40 of them. Um, we're going to lay them in in a few different locations. Probably if things go out the way we're thinking about it now. And we'll have what we call depots of tubes where we have maybe 10 tubes in a, in a, not a stack but in a line that the rover would then, the Fetch rover would then go and collect.

Speaker 1:          00:33:24       I think you guys have had a chance to see the sample tubes. This is kind of what it looks at. The sample looks like inside the tube. And then we have two plugs and seals that are intended to keep the sample from rattling around during the reentry. And then also a hermetically seal to make sure that any of the gases are things that might be in trained in that sample. Don't, don't get out so that the, the engineering of the sample tubes themselves, you have a very simple version of it there. But the actual samples who was quite a complex engineering endeavor, here are some ideas for, um, the, the architecture of that Sim we call Samp Srl sample return lander. Um, it could be something that looks like the curiosity platform and it carries the rocket on its back. The rocket is a little bit larger than human sizes.

Speaker 1:          00:34:12       It's about three meters in length and it weighs different ones that have different masses, but it's in the 200 to 300 kilo range. So it's a little heavier than a human and a little taller than the human, but it's roughly that size. You can have it on your back, which is great because you're picking up tubes that you don't have to go back anywhere and you just, when you, when you decide you have enough tubes, you finished loading them into the map and you launch it or are, we could have one that has a fixed platform where the mass stays on that platform in a smaller rover that's more the size of spirit or opportunity. Then would go out, collect the tubes, and then come back. And does that come back part of it that, that has us worried and led us to think about this thing we call a mobile map, which is, which is the curiosity class.

Speaker 1:          00:34:53       Um, there was a variety of different, um, autonomy and visualization technologies that are, that are being applied. This one is a, is a three d augmented reality, um, strategy that we're using not just for, um, to put ourselves the operators is the mission and the scientists from the mission on the surface of Mars so that they can look around and say, hey, I really care about this rock, but I, I love to see it from the other, from the other direction. And using orbital imagery, we synthesize full three d imagery of the, of the system so that the operators and the mission planners can really have a good situational awareness of what's happening on Mars. But we've even thought about doing that for like spacecraft assembly where you know, when you put the space craft together, it's really tightly packaged and you know, you wish that you could just look inside and see what, what was going on inside there.

Speaker 1:          00:35:41       And this is a, this is a way to synthesize the spacecraft in three d that allow you to literally walk through the spacecraft and see what's going on. Dude, you're the one in interior. This is that two minute elevator pitch. The other one is that right now the Mars Rovers, they actually roll quite slowly. We've, we've gotten a hundred meters in a day, but that's a very good day of driving and more frequently we're getting tens of meters per day to do this fetch operation. We're going to eat a lot better performance out of out of the rover. That's going to have some of the driving distance is a matter of power and thermal capability of, of the rover to survive the cold night at Mars. But a lot of it is that we're just not smart enough to process the information quickly enough to allow the rover to drive and even a walking pace and it would be wonderful.

Speaker 1:          00:36:36       Right now we're getting nine meters per day out of, out of both Mer and MSL. So it's not a matter of size. Even the rovers, even though one's much larger than the other, they're both rolling along at 10 meters per day. On average. We need about four or five times that level of performance. Then we could get it through. Um, better automation, better autonomy, better decision making onboard the rover so it can rove and not have to stop. You know, when there's a pebble in it's way. And that's a fantastic application for, for new technology development in the AI domain that I think would be great for this. For this system. I've talked a little bit about this basketball, we call it the, the orbiting sample and what you see are those sample tubes that I passed around. We cluster them and it turns out that when you kind of package them like a honeycomb and you can package either 19 of them in, I think it's four rings, we're at a fifth ring and you'd get up to 31 and that's what we're showing here.

Speaker 1:          00:37:31       33 one, two. And then that canister gets slid inside and it makes up a sphere and there, and you'll see in a minute why we want it to be spherical cause it makes it easier to, to catch it on orbit. Um, but just, just, sorry, I just know that way it's about the size of a basket. Basketballs 24 centimeters in diameter. This is 27 and it weighs about 25 pounds. So it's pretty massive actually. It's, it's, and it's almost all metal of some sort of titanium and stainless steel. This is just one concept for a massive launch where we have the platform and fetched one of the benefits of doing this versus the Moma Mab is the fetch rover can kind of back away and watch the launch. So we get some fantastic video and also you wouldn't kill Your rover, right? If those are the things launches off the back of the rover, the rover is not likely to survive that event.

Speaker 1:          00:38:21       So this is one advantage to the fetch and fixed platform. And speaking of mass, we've been looking at a variety of different rocket technologies to make this possible. There is solid rockets which are liked the little Estes rockets that as as a kid I hope you with. Um, there are the, the what called by propeller. Rockin switches are analogous to the space shuttle or what space x as launching now where you're mixing together a few on an oxidizer. Um, the hybrid is kind of halfway in between. It has a solid fuel, but either a liquid or a gaseous oxidizer. And it turns out for the Mars application, this hybrid is just right because we have problems with the solids cracking when they, when they descend in seventh and they have to encounter the landing environment that we have. It's also, um, they're not very good at, at, at cycling thermally hot to cold during the day. And the, the hybrid fuels don't have that problem. So we're looking at at a hybrid implementation for the math.

Speaker 3:          00:39:18       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:39:18       That was the, the landed system here is the, here is the, the orbiter system that would collect the, uh, the sample. It has big solar arrays because it actually uses what we call solar electric propulsion. Rather than using chemical rockets to propel itself, we, um, use solar power to heat up an ionized gas and then gets ejected out. The back end is a much more efficient power source. And this thing called rocks is the, is the package that captures the sample. I want to talk a little more about that. So the rocks system does this, basketball is in Maura's orbit and we, and it's a nerd. Okay. It has no propulsion system. So what we do is with the orbiter, we chase it down and we, we close in on it and we actually find finally rendezvous with it in the last sort of hundred meters we closed down.

Speaker 1:          00:40:09       And that that basketball gets put into some sort of a system that captures it and contains and, and I'm, I'm leading you to, to another technology that I wanted to show you. Um, we have to then either encapsulate it because it might have more as material on the outside. And remember we have to treat that Mars materials potentially hazardous. And then we, because we're so afraid of it, we actually do it twice and we do do to encapsulation exercises. And then we released that encapsulated systems somehow, either in the form of a reentry capsule that lands on the surface or there's other ideas. And we've been looking at our whole variety of different alternatives to how we do this rendezvous and capture it. Summer, very sort of, let's call them conventional mechanical things where you fly this thing kind of into a basket ball and met, um, that's this one here. Um, and then you close a loop in any and you drive it through the system. There's there, there's another one that I want to show you that in a second. That's, that's really cool.

Speaker 1:          00:41:08       There's the OSC coming into the, to the system. Uh, this one actually uses a mechanical arms to come and trap the OSCE. Then, uh, just, you know, this is all still attached to the spacecraft. We just delete it so you can see what's going on. We reoriented because we care what orientation those samples land on. We don't want them to land with the seal down and be driven through the seal. So we wanted them to kind of lay flat when they, when they land on the earth's surface. Here we're braising brazing is like soldering. It's kind of welding the, uh, the, the two halves of the container that the is, and then it moves into this thing that we call the earth entry vehicle. Um, and we do one other layer of containment there. So we have a second layer and you'll see this sort of hangar door thing flip open and then the Evie gets ejected.

Speaker 3:          00:42:04       Yeah

Speaker 1:          00:42:09       and that's, that's the whole sequence of everything that happens. Punch it off and there you go.

Speaker 1:          00:42:18       So I want it to talk about a really neat technology called flux pinning. The one scenario that I just showed you before we, we capture that oss with mechanical arms. This one uses, I'm super conductors and magnets and it turns out that there was a style of superconductor type two superconductor that if you take it through its transition temperature, you know, at at higher temperatures, these things just are sort of a nerd pieces of metal stuff. And then if you cool them down and in this particular class it's below 80 degrees Kelvin, they become super conductors. And it turns out that if you do these, these types of superconductors, if you take them through the transition temperature in the presence of a permanent magnet, they set up flux fields and these flux fields are what allow you to levitate this. This is just a regular permanent magnet, nothing special about this one. Um, it wants to stay in place there. As long as you hold that superconductor below. It's critical temperature in the presence of the magnetic field and wants to pin that magnet in place. And that turns out to be extremely valuable for what we're trying to do. Um, on the more sample return.

Speaker 3:          00:43:26       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:43:27       So we have, um, an idea that we could try to characterize this, this, uh, well in order to be able to use it to capture the OSCE and holding it oriented in proper position.

Speaker 1:          00:43:40       So in this context, the oss would have these permanent magnets on is on the perimeter, on the, on the outside of the thing, and it would fly into the spacecraft. And then using superconducting magnets arrayed in this pattern, we could actually control the orientation of the awesome. Not only would capture it using the superconductors, we actually could turn it into a, a preferential orientation and then trap it down. And I want it to show you just a couple of videos from a flight. Here's, here's an operation at Cornell on a, on a flat table, but I'll also show you a operational, we just did in, in March on a micro gravity a aircraft. We flew this thing because on the flat table we only get three degrees of freedom, right? It goes x and Y and you can get y'all, but you're not getting all six degrees. Is He pitch you on role? So actually this on the uh, on the micro gravity airplane aware.

Speaker 3:          00:44:37       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:44:38       There we go.

Speaker 3:          00:44:49       Okay. Day One before the guy learns. Don't, don't try to stand on one of these. Gravel is a good about 20 seconds. Okay. Anytime we get about three or four seconds. Good. Zero days. Let me just show you. Yeah, this is from camera. It's bounded on the frame. That's mine. I see how it just for a couple seconds got in there. Everybody was really jagged. Yeah, there's a particularly good, yeah. So it turns out there

Speaker 4:          00:46:10       if anything happens, if you touch any, anything in a plane, you're no longer together. Oscar is pouring out. So you'll see how far we actually translate in the plane in zero g.

Speaker 1:          00:46:25       So we do get to have some fun every once in a while. Um, and we're thinking about flying this on the space station in a couple of years and then eventually in, in Morris, this is simulating the landing of that Earth entry vehicle on the desert floor at 3000 g's.

Speaker 1:          00:46:46       And that's on a muddy. It could rain and in the desert and we were testing and what happens when it lands in mud and what it does and it just creates this huge splatter of blood. So I'm showing you the fun stuff, right? I'm not showing you, it was me sitting in meetings all day long and you know, developing budgets and schedules, I'm showing anymore. We get to fly on the micro gravity playing and when we get to make the mud goes splat. Okay, so downstream after this we have big ideas about other systems that could explore Mars, helicopters, balloons, landing more things, and eventually getting ready for humans. So sorry for the fast close there, but there's, if you're really interested in, please ask Mary for the slide package and you can look at it and warranty FTL and I'm happy to talk with you off offline. All right, thank you very much. I know I hit you with a fire hose.

Speaker 3:          00:47:40       Perfect.

Speaker 1:          00:47:46       I'm wondering with the sort of idea of uh, the magnetic capture, sort of firstly, what are the, does that have a long enough range to be practically useful in orbit? It feels like it would be range constraint more than a basket and sort of secondly, what were the reasons to use superconducting methods instead of active control with a regular little electromagnet to accomplish that task? Sure. So first fifth, two fantastic questions. Number one, it would be beautiful if this tractor beam acted over kilometers and you know, it was just like in Star Trek, but it acts over centimeters. The good, the good news is we can control the spacecraft to single digit centimeter. So I can fly about retrieval system up to the oss within about five centimeters. So I only need that tractor beam quality to, to actuate over single digit centimeters. And it does that.

Speaker 1:          00:48:38       That's that aspect of the really important thing is that we do it without contacting, without getting a lot of dust flying off of the OSCE and contaminating the spacecraft. That's, that's the big advantage over the conventional mechanical muses. And we never actually touched the awesome the scenario it comes in and it pins in that equilibrium condition with no contact to the spacecraft. And we're able to orient the oss without touching it. And it turns out that, that this orientation function is winding up being a big design. I didn't think it would be when we first embarked on this thing, but it turns out that orientation is a big design driver for the mechanical systems on. The second one is, why do we do it with superconductors rather than just regular commissional magnus? You could, but that, that potential well and that pinning capability in, in the equilibrium position is a lot more difficult to synthesize with electromagnets and wants to drive right into contact with a magnet and stick in contact.

Speaker 1:          00:49:31       Now you can levitate electromagnetically but it's a lot harder than this. Too much does it passively. So as long as you keep that superconductor below it's critical temperature. As long as you're keeping it that cold, you don't have to do anything else. You don't need an elaborate control system. It just, it just operates that way as long as you've pinned the magnet in place. So yes, you could do it with electromagnets, but the, the superconductors have a number of characteristics that are beneficial. That passive equilibrium position, the non contact case instead of those things make it advantageous. The downside is it's a low technology maturity right now. And so we're inventing the technology as we go. Most people have much more experience obviously with electromagnets, a conventional permanent magnets. So those things are intention in our development. Thank you. That's a super question. I actually had a similar question but I'll go with a different one cause you, uh, you answered my first one. I'd to know a little bit about,

Speaker 5:          00:50:28       um, the relationship between NASA and space x and how much coordination there is between the two organizations and how much competition there might be.

Speaker 1:          00:50:37       Yeah. Uh, another, another great question and I'll, and I'll going to do my best to be a candid but with a little bit of diplomacy. So, um, number one is, as I mentioned to you on, you know, really, really impressed with all the things that space x has been able to accomplish. Um, we, uh, especially at JPL, but Nasa Ames also has a relationship with space x. Um, we're helping them do some of the things that they really can't do for themselves. Like for instance, we're talking with them about some of the really technical aspects of the entry, descent and landing environment so that they understand some of the lessons that we learned the hard way without having to repeat them. And so we're off. We're providing them with some engineering support as they develop their system. And then there's other areas where they're not looking for that support.

Speaker 1:          00:51:25       They think they have the answer and they, and they may even have the personnel that have the experience that are able to give them that. So we're supporting them as some very particular engineering domains in areas where NASA has clear expertise that space x does not have in return. Um, there are discussions between space x and NASA about returning the favor in the form of landing things for us because we're only getting opportunities to land on the Mars surface every half a decade or so if they're going on every opportunity to be wonderful if we could put payloads onto their system. So there's, there's a bit of an interchange and there, there are motivations on, on both sides for, for that relationship. Um, one thing I can say is that I think SpaceX is really changing the paradigm. They certainly had done it in the launch vehicle game and I anticipate that as they spread into other domains like spacecraft satellites, um, like from Mars applications, they're going to change the paradigm in the way that they did for launch vehicles. They're going to change the paradigm in those other domains. I happen to be somebody who thinks that those paradigm changes are good for the ecosystem as a whole. So I'm really a huge fan of space x and I think most people that you talk to at JPL aims have sort of a similar perspective.

Speaker 5:          00:52:38       So I'm somewhat curious if there's been any lessons learned from rubber attempts of like other countries and uh, because you know, most of what we see is coming from NASA or maybe space x, but we don't see much coming at least, uh, publicized from, from the other countries,

Speaker 1:          00:52:57       right. In the domain of Mars exploration. Um, particularly when we talk about landing things on Mars and, and using them on Morris, the u s is kind of the only player that's been successful. Um, we actually have a very, one of the slides that I didn't show you guys today is we have a scorecard of successful attempts versus successes and it's like 39 at Townson 15 successes. And almost all of those successes are us. No one, no other country has successfully landed something on Mars that lasted for more than a few seconds. The Russians landed something that died in a matter of seconds. Um, we, the only the only country that's ever had anything that, that really delivered science back from the surface of Mars is the United States. Now, that's not to say that we don't have wonderful collaborations with other international partners like the European Space Agency that are providing things on the instrument level, and they're now getting to the point of trying to do things like rovers.

Speaker 1:          00:53:54       The Europeans are planning to launch a rover mission in 2020 that would sort of look like spirit and opportunity in terms of its ambitions for, for size and roving, distance and so forth. But no one's really yet been successful at the, let's call it the mission level. Um, uh, other than NASA. So right now the collaborations are at the instrument level, but I'm the mission level. We're still waiting for them to catch up. Um, I'm wondering why you have the second rover at all. I mean if you just kept all the things on the first rover and you say the rocket that's coming is going to be able to land, you know, on a dime. We're not just land next to it. Yeah, I guess I'm never going to get an easy questions for you guys. Very insightful question and yes you could do this with one single landed element, but let me explain technical motivations and also allude to some programmatic or motivations.

Speaker 1:          00:54:52       Technically the mission that it's going to take to collect those samples are going to take a couple of years on the Mars surface. And while we've had, you know, we've had great success spirit lasted seven years. Opportunity is, is 12 years, curiosity is now when it's what, fifth year, six year of operation. We can't count on those super long mission durations, particularly the solar power systems. If they ever get themselves in a conditioning where they're sort of stuck and they can't point, there were rays at the sun over the winter, the Mars winter, they freeze to death. So we're very reluctant to bake into our mission planning multi year missions. And we think that that collection process is going to take a couple of years, and so it kind of eats up the amount of time that we're willing to allocate to a single mission. Um, the collection operation, it actually takes less time then the sample.

Speaker 1:          00:55:47       When I say collection, I mean the fetching operation at collecting the sample tubes from the surface takes much less time than the, than the drilling of the cores and laying those samples down on the surface. And we're just nervous that that's too much to pack into one single mission. That's the technical explanation. There's a programmatic explanation that says we're sending the Mars 2020 mission to Mars to do a fantastic institchu mission, which by the way stands on its own. We would send that system, I believe, regardless of whether or not there was a sampling package on it. But it's great that we have the sampling package and we get started on Mars sample return. Um, and we built some momentum that says, Hey, um, uh, Congress and the Congressional Budget Office, we have 33 sample tubes lying on the surface of Mars. They have unbelievable science locked inside them, please, let's go get them and bring them home.

Speaker 1:          00:56:41       That's a compelling story that gets to be told starting in 2021 when the 2020 rover lands rather than betting on the come and sending that mission in 2027 2028 and hoping that you have good samples. So the opportunity to get started soon have something that's compelling to bring back helps to motivate the rest of the missions. So I told you a technical story and I told your programmatic store in both of those combined are why we have separate missions for caching and in return we could conceivably do it on one mission, but it makes more sense to do it in two.

Speaker 1:          00:57:17       Yeah. So the, the question for those of you who couldn't hear the question was do these, these two rovers that are participating in sample return, do they have a mission after they've completed their through sampling, um, responsibilities and the answer certainly in the case of 2020 and the answer is an emphatic yes. Um, it as I, as I said before, it has an instrument package that's doing in such science in addition to the, to the sampling operation that Institchu science can happen before your collect samples, while you're collecting samples, after you collect samples and as a, after I just told this story that we're afraid of the rovers aren't going to last very long. The reality is they do in practice the last for a long time and we anticipate after we finished that sample caching mission, if the rover is still going strong, we would continue the science mission.

Speaker 1:          00:58:02       The one that's a little bit more sort of not clear at this point is the fetch rover and as I showed you on that, that one image that showed the Mab launch where we had a small fish rover that could stand off from the Mab launch and observe it from a safe distance. That one we expect that the, hopefully the rover would survive that Bab launch and go on to do more science. The mobile math where you're carrying the map on your back and you and you put it into his launch orientation and off it goes, that one probably trashes the rover and we been thinking about ways to maybe, you know, put the, the, the, the rocket off the back of the rover. So it's not thrusting directly down onto it, but, but that, that, that fetching mission also the, the, the amount of science instrumentation that we would be able to put on that system, which is already doing the Malveaux and everything, it's a much more questionable thing. So I think 2020 is going to, it's going to do a good ancillary science mission air regardless of the sampling operation. The ability of the Fetch rover to, to continue to do more science is questionable. So that's playing into the architecture of the missions.

Speaker 6:          00:59:04       Okay. So Brian wants to know, how are you planning to get the necessary amount of maneuvering capability to rendezvous with the OSTP given that the vehicle uses an eye on drive.

Speaker 1:          00:59:14       Great. Five for five,

Speaker 4:          00:59:20       what? Ask me like why Mars is red or something like that. Please send me a softball and I could smash out of the field. Now, um, we'll, we'll actually augment that ion thrusting system with a cold gas thrusters system specifically for the purpose of doing the, the rendezvous function. And we could not execute the rendezvous purely with the low thrust engines that you have when you're doing ion thrusting. So it'll be cold gas, either hydrazine or maybe even xenon. That was the pressure and it was, was the gas that we're blowing out of the ion thruster, we might be able to use some spare a xenon for that function. It turns out in practice, hydrazine has a much more packs, so much more powerful punch. And so it's better for us to use hydrazine as the fluid, but we will not try to do it with the ion engines. We do the rendezvous with a cold gas or, or, or hydrazine system.

Speaker 5:          01:00:08       Is there any consideration to have more than one sample return? The returning vertical, for example, collecting more samples opportunistically. And two, we were able to collect more than send another mission liking next five years.

Speaker 4:          01:00:27       Right. So the question was, is there a perhaps a motivation to have multiple sample returns either from the sample set? Um, I'm gonna extend a little bit on your question either from the samples that we take from 2020, um, or multiple sample return missions themselves on the answer. The answer is yes. Uh, we were going to carry, right now the plane is security a little more than 40 of these sample tubes and we'll collect as many as we can. We'll lay as many on the surface as, as possible. My guess is that none of them are going to be such duds that, that we would want not want to bring them back. Right. Um, there's going to be a fantastic scientific debate on whether we bring back sample two, four, six, nine, etc. Which ones we bring back. But we're, we're most likely not going to be able to bring back every single tube that we, that we collect.

Speaker 4:          01:01:15       So there, there would be a strong motivation to want to return all of those tubes. Um, furthermore, we're only going to be able to land at one site and do science and that one location. And while we're trying to pick landing sites that have a diversity of potential, um, scientific return, it is only one place. And then just like on earth, you know, you can, it's not the same thing to vacation in Hawaii as it is to vacation in Finland. And so we would, we would want to go to other places on Mars and return samples from multiple locations that of course a required different mission to do the sample collection of caching. Also, as you can tell from, from what I've described to you so far, we're making are rather large investment in the technology for this. And it would be great to see it amortized over multiple missions rather than just one singular one. So we can, we, we can envision multiple sample return missions either to finish, kind of finished the job if there's still good samples left from the first mission or to have multiple sample returns flown from different landing sites, different samples, suites.

Speaker 5:          01:02:18       So, so now that we have pretty strong evidence that there was a historical flowing liquid water on Mars, um, would that have potentially impacted, uh, kind of the coloration or the planet such that they're red planet was not historically? Right.

Speaker 4:          01:02:39       That's a, that's a hard question as a easy question.

Speaker 4:          01:02:45       So I'm not kidding. You've stumped me more with that question then. With all the previous ones that have come, uh, you know, the red plants red because it's iron oxide in the soil. That's why it's red. The presence of liquid water didn't really affect the fact that desire and oxide exists on Mars. I think that, that, that's not necessarily, the water's not necessary for that iron oxide to form, so that the connection between color and presence of water, um, I may have a scientific colleague who's going to make my phone buzz in a, in a as 80. Oh, no, you're wrong. Um, but I, I think that those are relatively disconnected phenomena.

Speaker 3:          01:03:23       Thank you again.
