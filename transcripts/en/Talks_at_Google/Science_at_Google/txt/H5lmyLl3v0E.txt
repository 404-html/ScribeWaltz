Speaker 1:          00:06          Well, good afternoon everyone. My name is Vint cerf. I'm your chief Internet evangelist. And that wasn't the title I asked where I wanted arch Duke, but he didn't work out. We're here to talk about operation smile and you don't want to hear that from me. You want to hear that from the guy that's going to actually make it happen. And so I wanted to introduce Ruben Allah to give you an idea of what this is all about. And I've stolen, uh, his bio here, so I need comes from Google, right? So that means it must be correct. Um, and I don't want to read the whole thing cause he's going to tell us a little bit about how he got involved in this in the first place. That's a story all by itself, but he's a physician and he's a public health specialist from Panama, but he spent 25 years with Operation Smile, which tells you something about how dedicated he has been to the project.

Speaker 1:          01:04          And by the time he's done with his talk today, I think you'll understand why, uh, he actually got involved when he was still an undergraduate. If I remember correctly, you were a translator for the program is from Panama. So he was helping the people who didn't happen to speak Spanish, presumably, uh, to, uh, execute on their, on their project. Uh, he's got all kinds of experience with lots of organizations, uh, dealing with health care all around the world. And I, I don't want to spend too much time, frankly, Ruben on your biography because what's important is not what you've done but what you're doing. And that's what I want people to hear about. So, uh, let's get room in up here to tell us the story of operation smile and his involvement in it. So Ruben [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          01:54          the stage is yours.

Speaker 3:          03:55          Yeah,

Speaker 4:          04:04          good afternoon everybody. It's really great to be here with you today and we appreciate the time that you've taken to actually come join us and to those of you who are connected as well, hopefully you'll enjoy this story of hope and transformation. I am speaking with Vince before coming to join you. He talks about the tire that you all have as a, as an organization to share knowledge, allow people to learn, allow people to collaborate and the ability to get the knowledge to actually create solutions to complex, very, very complex problems. And if we actually do do that every day, if we actually do, do solve problems that actually can help the lives of people, uh, then, then we have something, right. Um, so my colleague and friend Chris, Brian and I are here to talk about operation smile. And as you see in that you've seen in the video, in the picture, um, we take her children were born with a facial deformity called cleft lip and cleft palate.

Speaker 4:          04:58          Uh, and this kits, um, you know, are, are coming to the world in many different countries. You actually have the ability to go to take care of them in so many other countries, the treatment that they saw required is not necessarily readily available, but we can solve that problem. So operation smile started back in 1982 and the Philippines and Dr. McGee and his wife Cathy Mcgee went to the Philippines. And I say, I drove around the pool area, say realize the amount of need. But they're very quickly went into a very nice hotel and they started driving through, through, through the countryside. And so the beautiful landscapes and the beautiful children, but nothing could have ever prepared him to see what they saw in the small town of Naga CT where they were supposed to operate on about 50 children who were born with cleft lips and palates.

Speaker 4:          05:48          300 of them came and their families. So as they made their way through the masters of people, they could send some society, the despair and they did take care of those 50 children at that time. And there were no plans of going back. A woman came to Dr. McGee and his wife and said, you know, I have his basket of bananas that I like to give you to say thank you for trying. Thank you for trying. Her kid had no received surgery, but just the fact that someone had actually tried was meaningful enough for her to probably give one of the few things you had. Uh, the director of the hospital at that time said, you know, if you ever get a chance to come back, please come back because these kids will still be here. There might be five or 10 years older. Um, but they'll still be here.

Speaker 4:          06:34          So they went back to the United States live we can do to came back to live their lives as usual, but they couldn't stop thinking about these kids. So they gather a whole bunch of friends and went back in time and time again. And that's how operation smile started. And as they say in life, there are no ordinary moments. This was an extraordinary, extraordinary moment that set in motion a chain and a sequence of events that has allowed many people like you to actually be engaged in this transformation. We was talking about the fact that I was born in Panama and up to the age of 16, this is what I had seen of Panama. This is a beautiful city, the amazing beaches. If you ever get a chance to visit, please visit. I guarantee you'll enjoy it. But beyond that, um, I, I didn't really know they need so my own country.

Speaker 4:          07:19          So when Operation Smart came in 1992, this is what I saw, hundreds of people again coming to Ho to operation smile at the hospital. And at that point I met bill and Cathy Mcgee, which was amazing. But I started asking myself, what have these kids been? Why haven't I never seen one of them? And I started to learn about the people, Panama, my con, the country where is worn through little Bartolo and his sister c, but 12 was about two years old when his sister was about eight years old and she had traveled for five hours to get to the place where operation smile was. She had nothing but a couple of changes, some diapers, a bottle, a little pocket change, and the normal responsibility of bending her baby brother back with surgery and hopefully a new lease in life. Think about it, eight years old, how many eight year old children that you know, where that responsibility so, but was sick, what operation smile treated him.

Speaker 4:          08:23          And he was, by the end of the last day of surgery, he was, he was healthy enough for surgery and the tears of his little sister as she held him in the recovery room sort of become this emotional symbol of what transformation can be for people like care for children like her. But they were, they became the conduit for me to start to learn about the needs of people in my country. And on the other side I saw hundreds of volunteers coming together to actually help them. So they will have a place to sleep. So they have to food to eat. So they have transportation in addition to surgery. Uh, they could go back home, um, knowing that they had been truly cared for being careful. This is the team that actually came to Panama in 1992 and if you see there's a brand dot and their side, that's me at 16, translating and learning.

Speaker 4:          09:15          When I go back to Panama, I go back with a great sense of joy because what I see now is my country mates doing the work by themselves. You see, that group didn't just come to caretaker children. They came to set an example. They came to share the knowledge. They came to use that knowledge to create a change, to take action, to solve a problem, and that's spread like wildfire and the people in my country, and that's the sense of the reasons of joy and pride. Now when you see the pictures of children with cleft lips and this, this gap in the, in the, in the mouth, you might think, well, if you fix it for me, that's it, right? This kids actually have to have had to endure bullying, making fun. We'd be made fun of being ostracized so we can change that, but it's much more than appearances is much more than than than what you see.

Speaker 4:          10:07          These kids actually have a lot of problems eating. So imagine it's not just the opening of the lid, but I saw also in the opening of the roof of your mouth, whenever you go into a swimming pool and you drink water and it goes through the nose, it's very painful because there's this openness, an open openness in, in the roof of the mouth. That's what these kids feel every single time they try to feed. So imagine you having a baby and trying to feed this baby and the painful experience that this baby has to go through. So when we fix the deformity, we enabled the baby to be nourished properly, to feed properly, to grow properly, and to fight disease properly. Imagine the moment among holds her child and gifts. Uh, I'm breastfeeds that moment is restored and the beauty that goes along with it.

Speaker 4:          10:52          In addition to that, because of that openness there is that that whole children have a difficult time speaking. Um, so when we actually do surgery on them and we closed that, that, that it's not only about closing the hole but actually putting the muscles where there's the muscles are supposed to be. Children are able to speak properly again and then they're able to go to school. They will to communicate with their peers every three minutes, somewhere in the world. A child is being born this way, but we have solution. We can actually erase this formally. We can actually take care of these children. There are many diseases in the world that today we don't have a solution for. We can correct this. It just takes the ability to dream and action to actually follow through and create and turn that dream into a reality. So we do believe that no child should have to suffer from lack of access to safe surgery.

Speaker 4:          11:44          But it isn't only about children. And as you go through the chilled to two through different towns and countries, you understand the level of need. And back in 1998 much younger back then I met Rosa Maria Rosa. Maria was a 73 year old woman and she had lived her entire life with this deformity and I couldn't help myself. I had to ask her, but somebody, yeah, for 73 years you have lived this way. What made you finally get surgery to what she promptly answered. I didn't know I could get care. I had no idea that it could get surgery and these could be fixed and then she said my entire life I have hoped to be like any other woman to make me feel pretty. For an instance, maybe even wear lipstick now too to the females in this room and so many of us when I think, well lipstick of all things, but think about it for a second.

Speaker 4:          12:41          You get up in the morning, you do your head hair, you do your makeup and you don't think about it twice. This movement had dream about them moment for 73 years I do news. She got surgery and by the time she left, all the female volunteers and doctors and nurses had given her, given her all the cosmetics that you have brought, probably likely enough to last her lifetime. So operation smile continues to try to go to every corner of the earth. And we've operated on boats, we've operated on planes, we have operator classrooms. This is actually a project that we have. We actually have to respond and we are able to respond to some of the victims in Haiti outside of the cliffs. We've operated on tents. We were looking to operate on mobile units and frogs creating seven environments. But we've also created infrastructure that that allows kids to receive the very, very best, no matter where they are, hospitals and centers that that offered nothing but excellence, uh, to these kids because we believe that they all need save.

Speaker 4:          13:40          Well, Tom and effective surgery. Now, how many of you have had surgery and raise your, your hands? Cool. So the vast majority of you have that surgery, believe it or not, by the time you're 14, 15 about two thirds of you would have needed some type of intervention. And if that's the case, but you live in a country where you don't have access, what's the answer to the rest of your future? You might actually have to live with disability or simply die. Billions of people today still are knocking the access to safe surgery and the poorest third of the world actually have a very small amount of access to care available. This is a problem we can solve this problem we should solve. And this is where you come in because using your gifts is what enables people to actually start making wave and, and solving complex problems like the ones we discussed.

Speaker 4:          14:33          Um, you have the ability to actually take someone from the shadows and give that person the ability to live a normal, happy, fulfilling life. And He's, when you actually make a change in someone's life is not that person. Is that family, is that community? Certainly the, to me, someone like doing Alex who story I'll tell you represents sort of the best in humanity and the people who are impacted by what you might do or what your, what you do and in turn take that energy and continue the chain of positive actions. So here's he's, he's holding his little kid and this is don't Alix. And as I asked them, Alex, no, Alex, what do you feel when you realized that your child had been born this way? And as he tells me the experience, this is many years after he starts to cry and he says, I was hopeless.

Speaker 4:          15:27          I was ready to sell my little house on and the little car that I had inherited because I knew I had to go for care for a to my child. He didn't have to because of volunteers and members of operation, smile team, he's baby kid. Boy was able to get surgery. What, what's remarkable about them, Alex, is that he realized that he wasn't the only one who was in that situation. So he started going around his region of Alachua in Honduras, making sure that any child who was born this way, we'll make his or her way to operation smile. And these are some of the families that through him having able to make it to operations from Honduras to get care. So every action that is positive and makes a change in the lives of people creates actually an avalanche of really positive things. And because of that is that I, I tell you today, we need you.

Speaker 4:          16:24          It's the reason we need you because we can dream bigger. What if through all the different tools and, and opportunities that you create with your knowledge, we were able to not only my powder, how fireline show is, but where all the children that he's found and the children who, um, we need to make sure I continue to get care and they once were being born, who, who might not be able to understand how far they had to get to and how can we make sure that we use that knowledge to offer assistance so that they can make it to a place where they can get the care they need. What if we use the tools at our disposal to make sure that not a single mom has to software because she doesn't know that her child can actually get care. Today there about 7 million people who made 7 million healthcare workers in the world.

Speaker 4:          17:17          We're still required to take care of the needs of people, so we have to train more providers. What if we're able to use the tools are this puzzle to make sure that the knowledge is readily available so that more people engage, some more people create so that more people share so that more people give their talents to, to actually create this opportunity to give someone a chance, um, and do so in the most, normally the most more knowledgeable, knowledgeable ways, but the humane ways. What if we were able to look at how the, the supplies and equipment, our source I sharing and putting the right places in a way that's efficient so that not a single operating room where children are being transformed will ever lack any piece of equipment. Now here's another one. Today we have the ability to operate in this kids. But if you were to ask me, do we know what the best technique is, I will have to tell you no.

Speaker 4:          18:14          And what happens is many surgeons will tell you the best technique to take care of his kids is the technique that the surgeon is most comfortable with. I don't know about you, but that doesn't make me feel very warm and fuzzy. I mean you don't go to and have cardiac surgery and say, you know, I don't know what technique is the best one, but I'll use my own and see how he goes. But because we have the ability to look at the before and the after, what if we were able to use modeling to understand how symmetry and soap happening and matched that they're really good outcomes to the, to the techniques and now we're not talking about a manual process of those kinds of surgeries. We could actually be taking the knowledge of thousands of surgeries operations, operation smart has Oprah in over 300,000 children and would not knowledge. We could actually come back to the surgeons or anybody who wants to learn to actually take care of this case and says this is the way to take care of them. This is the one that's going to give them the best result. This is the one that's going to give a chance to kids. So actually smile.

Speaker 4:          19:14          You may or may not know, but we believe that change starts with the young people. And because we believe that we have to take action for those and, and decades and hundreds of years to come, we have to empower the young people to start a movement or to grow their movement. Operation Smile has very proudly, um, join forces for decades now with, with high school students now with middle school students or university students, they might not be doctors and nurses, but they have no ulterior motives. If they say, I want to help a kid, what they say so much more pristine and beautiful and genuine that anything am I able to be able to say. So if they are telling us it's change starts with me and we give them a platform to advocate, to make those changes, to, to spread the message, to educate, to engage, to actually say everyone can smile and to actually empower them to continue to say, we won't stop until we heal.

Speaker 4:          20:14          I think we're on to something. I think we're on to something. Last but not least today, we have the ability to correct the deformity. But I have to tell you, we don't have the ability to avoid it from happening, ultimately. Like to be out of a job. We'd like to be able to say, we have to stop. We can stop this from happening all together. So how about the ability to generate that knowledge, to investigate, to research and to come up with the, with the ways to avoid, um, a child from having to be born into this world with this, with this disease where this 4 million, so we know that if in the, in, in a, in some parts of Asia, one in every 500 children is one this way. We know that in the United States, one of every thousand children, there's one this way. So it's interesting if you take someone from Asia, from that population in Asia, and they moved to the United States a couple generations later, if they haven't mixed, the incidence goes from one in 500 to one in a thousand.

Speaker 4:          21:11          So we know that there's something in the genetics that's interacting with the environment that's triggering the deformity, that's, that's creating this thing from half ever. And, but if we are able to avoid it from happening altogether, um, that will be something truly celebrate in a nutshell. Whenever we see a kid in an empty operating room, in some remote region of the world, we know today, we can actually feel that with supplies and teams and people who are knowledgeable, who are kindhearted, who actually want to make a change. But for that to happen, many more people have to actually engage. So when you actually decide to join us to actually support us, whether it's with resources or time or, or your talents and your knowledge, you become the heroes. It might be true that in that operating room there's a doctor, a nurse, a, an a, an an a scrub nurse and Nsse ologist.

Speaker 4:          22:03          But you are truly the ones for enabling that bridges moment to happen. I'll stop with this. Um, the story a couple of years ago, I was empire way and I met Carlos and one of the recovery room and other recovery roommates see Carlos with his baby rock and his baby and singing to her and rocking her and singing to her so much love. And as I'm filling out the medical record, I couldn't help but be moved by the moment. And I asked the nurse if she knew anything about it and he said, well, mom sort of left them because she couldn't deal with the fact that the baby would have been more with a deformity. So He's been raising this child by himself. I walked to Carlos and I said, you know, I hope you won't mind me saying this, but I've seen you. I've seen the way you love your kid.

Speaker 4:          22:47          And if at some point I get a, I get to be fortunate enough to be a dad and I'm fortunate enough to love my child half as much as yours, as you love yours, I will consider myself a very, very fortunate man. So a few months ago I gave a welcome to my, my, my little baby girl, Amelia. But the reason I show you will do this picture is not only because of the joy that she brings to me, but because of that memory of that commitment to be a good father, to be a loving father, to be a loving member of our communities. And societies have to actually do something about the ones for less fortunate than I am. So on behalf of every single operation, smile member in the world who would spend every ounce of energy, who will see beauty in every single one of his children who would actually share with you the excitement that we feel every time we bring a kid out of the operating room and give it back to mom, to you, the thinkers, the innovators, the dreamers. We asked you to join us and we give thanks for everything you do.

Speaker 2:          23:53          Okay.

Speaker 1:          24:00          I think I'm going to stand here and cry for it. We're going to do a little Q and a and I already have a couple of questions that I want to, you have to stand up. This is the way we treat our guests here. Yeah, there you go. So, um, well I don't know about you, but every, every time I hear this story, you know, it really, it's very touching. But you began at the very end to tell us a little bit about what causes this condition. And the answer is we actually don't know. Is that right? Yeah.

Speaker 4:          24:40          Well, when many, many diseases, you can actually identify the disease to a specific chromosome, even to a specific gene with clapping. We have many different genes that are involved and we're still actually discovering some potential genes that have some influence over, over, over the creation of this is a 4 million. Now this, this happens, if you think about it, this is me, happens anywhere from the four to 12 a week of gestation. So when, when the, the, the mom's side of the earliest, uh, uh, parts of pregnancy, anything that my impact, that beautiful process of sales coming together and an organ we informed, uh, could potentially impact, um, the process in itself and end up in a, in a club. So we're still trying to figure out not only all the genes, but also the interactions between those genes and the environment.

Speaker 1:          25:29          So is there evidence that it's genetic, you know, there's, are their families for example, that have a higher percentage of children born with this condition and other families do? Correct? Correct. So you do, you make a practice of, uh, by the way you guys have questions, you should be thinking about them and their microphones on either side of the room so that you should take advantage of that. Um, is it, are you taking DNA samples, for example, from errands in children and accumulating that overtime? It seems to me are kinds of neural networks are pattern matching algorithms and other kinds of big data analysis might allow us to find correlations, um, between the genetic information and the children that we discovered with this condition.

Speaker 4:          26:15          Certainly. Um, a few years ago we actually started collecting DNA samples. Now it's a lot easier because the samples now or just swaps or, or saliva we take, so it's not intrusive to, to children and families. But we understood that by explaining to them the, the opportunity that they were given us to maybe stop this from happening altogether, that we would, we, we felt that we could have their support and we have got an overwhelming support from the family. So we actually have the largest repository of DNA information, um, and different populations in the world. Um, we've started to study it and we continue collecting the samples because we believe that, um, when we're able to actually finally target specific areas and, and the environment, the relationship with gene environment, we'll be able to start solving this problem.

Speaker 1:          27:01          You mentioned that you see different incidences of this condition in different parts of the world. Um, so that suggests that you mentioned the environmental conditions, which might include viruses or bacteria as well as genetics might have a role to play. It seems to me we have a companies and even know which are called Calico and California Life Company. It's trying, it notices that people get old and it's trying to figure out how to stop that. And I'm interested in that for obvious reasons. Uh, unfortunately the engineers misinterpreted that. It's sort of like that's the fastest way to make sure nobody gets old. That's not the solution is the problem that we're looking for. Uh, but they're trying to look for genetic evidence from centenarians. What is it about the people who live to a hundred years or more? What is it about their genetics than mine correlate? So I just wonder if the tools that they're using might conceivably be applicable to this problem.

Speaker 4:          28:03          First of all, I was really interested in that product as well. Uh, but absolutely, yes. You know, the same process of understanding how we are impacted by what's around us. Um, and the richness of information that we have within ourselves or impact that it's can be replicated in that way. So, you know, now when we know today that nutrition plays a role, we know that potential, uh, medications play a role. We know that alcohol, tobacco, some drugs might play a role, but how do you explain that to a mom who's never,

Speaker 1:          28:35          well, you can't, but, but think about Zika, which had such a dramatic effect on children and microcephaly. We were able to discover that correlation very, very quickly. But I think it was because it was in Brazil, the first incident is starting to show up and it was extremely intense. Large numbers, written relative terms were happening all at the same time. And so the correlation was established there. Here we have, uh, what I guess is a more diffuse effect and much harder to food discovery. Um, if you have questions, you should use the microphones and if you don't, I'm going to keep going. Uh, so how long does it take to train a surgeon to perform this procedure? And the implication of, one of the things you said is it is not exactly the same procedure every time. It depends on the nature of the deformity, how you choose to resolve it. So this sounds like it's not a simple, uh, training program. What, how long and how hard is that?

Speaker 4:          29:38          So I'm going to say the procedure of taking of a child with a cleft lip, it's a shortest, 45 minutes. In 45 minutes or less, you can actually transform the life of a kid. And, and the pilot surgery takes about an hour to an hour and a half by the the, the United States for instance. It's certainly this would take care of these of these um, problem would have trained 14 years after high school to be able to finally take care of this. But you know, today many of them are saying we, there would be ways to streamline this training so that it's not so long so that more people in the world have access to the knowledge base and tools to take care of this, of, of, of, of this, uh, formative and but, but again, he gets runs the, it gets them to be a little bit more complex because there's such where ID and in techniques, but going back, what if we actually had the best technique? Why did we were able to categorically say, if you do this card here and this Martin here and this flap here, you will have a really good result for the kids. Then you can shorten that amount of training.

Speaker 1:          30:35          Well, there certainly are a lot of, I'm not an expert in surgery. You are. But my impression is that there are surgical protocols that are fairly well defined for certain kinds of conditions. And so maybe there's a triage here where there are a set of situations that are solved fairly readily and obviously with a particular procedure. And then the others that are more complicated. We have classroom night over there. You want to say who you are and then,

Speaker 5:          31:00          yeah, sure. Eli Is Pinto here. I'm a cloud. See you in New York. Um, you kind of already touched a little bit and when I was going to go around training, but here's a question to you. So what do you think is the biggest challenge right now? Is it, is it finding the people? Is it the logistics of getting the, uh, or quality stuff down to those locations? Is it money? Is it just training? And then the, that's the segue from the last question. What do you think is the biggest thing preventing the next big push? The next big, big plateau. Does that make sense?

Speaker 4:          31:34          Yes, absolutely. I realize that's a great question. First of all, I gotta say thank you for being at the top in the front of the other room. Um, so it's, it's really all, all of them, all of the above. So we have the ability to actually put some resources into the problem. But do we have, how are we putting enough resources into them? But if you look at that as trying to solve the supply may, let's say I put more doctors, we created more hospitals, we put together more operating rooms. That still doesn't solve the problem itself because our children, their families have all these barriers before they even get it get to us. So we put a great team to offer care in a very, very remote location. And sometimes they still have to travel 10 12 hours to even get to us. And that 10 to 12 hour trajectory means that they have to invest whatever little money they might have.

Speaker 4:          32:21          Some of them even borrow from the village to even get to us. So more so some of the, the barriers are related to money. So much geographical, someone or just knowledge, you know, people aren't saying if you go, something bad will happen to you or you shouldn't go because you've been, this is, this is your punishment for something you did, Eh, or your family has done. So there's this belief in some places that that's life and there's no solution for it and you have to live through your punishment. So, um, I guess what I'm saying is there's not a simple solution. There's not a, uh, one, one thing I do will fix this problem, um, today. Um, but we do have to start looking at how we train people better so they're more out there. How, how we are in more equitable and the things that we do so that we don't forget about the poorest or the most marginalized or are they more of the mass, the ones who most remote.

Speaker 4:          33:13          Um, it isn't only about the doctors and the nurses and the hospital is about truly understanding the people who are suffering from this deformity and all the things that are stopping them from getting to us. Um, but I think there's an amazing opportunity again with, with uh, a group of, of, of individuals and really smart and innovative as you to actually figure out some of the solutions. It matters a great deal to them. And if I happen to believe that if we are fair, if we're honest, and then then we'll actually be able to make a change in their lives and in turn they will impact our lives in a positive way as well. You can ask her

Speaker 5:          33:50          if I may. Um, so if I heard you correctly then the biggest challenge to reach in the next spot, so really happens way before they even show up. Right. And I'm trying to think of ways that Google can help, whether it is empowering the government and in spreading out that information, and it sounds to me, correct me if I'm wrong, were comedies is that challenge of with the ramp of up to the person showing him that solving that set of problems is, is, is what,

Speaker 4:          34:16          that's one that's, that's important. And that's maybe why I showed that map. Because a lot of places in the world, a lot of countries do not even know this is a significant problem. There's not a registry. So until we go there and you say, luck, we like to do this, they don't realize that hundreds of kids or our people are having to deal with this. And all of a sudden, what if we were able to actually mad the areas where this kids are so we can actually do follow up if we know that they're really far, how do we help them get to us? Um, if we, if we understand from, from the ones who come to us or they're having other issues in terms of knowledge and beliefs, how do we address those as well? Um, but you know, it'll, it'll take something that enormous amount of resources and talent and commitment to actually make it happen, but we can make it happen. So yes, we have a question over here.

Speaker 6:          35:01          Thank you for coming. Talk to you. But from my personal experience is not mine, but my cousins, my cousin is younger to me and he just married yesterday. Yeah. Yesterday. And he had a cleft, um, from the very beginning when I believe they did try the surgery when he was seven or eight years old. That was the first shot he faces a little bit. But then he went again. Um, I never, I mean I will definitely understandably naive. I always had an excuse. I was the younger one, but I think that the entire family didn't really know what was going on because of the grades and the school performance and nobody knew that everybody thought they existed. How the brain is just list. Um, and um, but now he's married, he's an engineer, but it took him a lot of it for it to get where he was a and multiple surgeries and I guess there was a couple of decades ago, so I'm sure things have advanced a bit, but what are the success scenario?

Speaker 6:          36:08          This is when they looked at that I thought like, wow, that's amazing that I haven't seen in practice. Um, in my, in others like looking at my whatever sample set I have seen, um, and that was also in India. So where there could be a, not at the top of the line, surgical a surgery procedures, I have to keep her in that area as much as here. Um, my main channel is more like how would, if you wouldn't know there wasn't Google there then either like I could just Google it and put the picture in search. Hey, what is this? So, um, how would things have been different if he would be 20 years younger and we were born now

Speaker 4:          36:56          that's a great question. First of all, congratulations. That's amazing that he just got married and that's exactly the, the, the type of story you want to tell because kids were born this way should have the opportunity to live a full and happy life. So that's fantastic. But um, I imagine that you're talking about a couple that gets out, go in India, that your family, we actually have to go through the hardship of having to figure out how to offer a care. Now, you mentioned he was operated at the age of six, but if I were to tell you that today, operation smile operates, takes care of these kids from three months on a ball above in the United States in a few weeks after birth, the kids are being taken care of. So we do three to six months, started the surgical process out of maintaining a level of safety courses, obviously surgery.

Speaker 4:          37:42          So we want to make sure the kid is strong enough, but the younger you take care of them, the, the, the skying is probably least, least likely to actually be noticed. Um, in an ideal scenario, this is the outcome that you want. You know, a child who, who looks beautiful and you can barely tell. Um, but sometimes it'd be as, as soon as the surgery, the outcome might not be the best one. So maybe a little short. So you have to go on and read through the surgery. And that's again why it's so important to understand what the surgeons that are getting these beautiful outcomes and learn from those surgeons consistently and throughout now. So the rate of success to actually be able to take care of a kid 45 minutes, it's doable. The Red of success, uh, in the hands of experts is, is really, really very high.

Speaker 4:          38:30          And that's why it's so important to train. Um, but your story is one of hope because he was able to grow even through the hardship of getting a treatment later. But you post a question, what if, uh, he had been born today, it would have been easy to find out a little bit or get a picture and find out where he could go to actually receive a treatment. That would have been really nice. Right? So information, it gives you choices, but what about places in the world? But there's still no information. There are places in the world would, you still don't have access? Uh, so hopefully at some point soon and we'll, we'll, you know, anywhere in the world, a family may have access to through our mobile unit, him and sometimes in a conscious where you don't have a computer where you have a alum phone is actually pretty pervasive. It used to be that that wasn't the case. But what if every single family and in any village in the world and in this small little town could actually find out that, oh, my child was born this way, but I can get care. So it would be a different story. Right? So you, you, he wouldn't have had to wait until six years old, but today if we actually made this possible, then maybe children shouldn't weighed more than a few months to actually get this taken care of.

Speaker 1:          39:43          So this raises a very interesting possibility. And we, we've been doing work on facial modeling, for example, which you alluded to in your talk, uh, in order to try to understand, you know, what would happen if we perform surgery on this child? What might the outcome look like? That's helpful for the family to understand. But I can imagine having a family that takes a photo with their mobile phone and instead of saying, find me more pictures like this, which was one of the features that we have a, it would be, what can I do about this? Um, you know, show me places that, uh, that, uh, can treat this, uh, visible situation. Uh, that's sounds almost doable. It sounds like we could find a way to take a picture. You're like that do a search. They would turn up operation smile for example. So we ought to think about it.

Speaker 4:          40:36          Yeah. And he goes back to their license. Original question, what else can we do with that? We have the ability to do

Speaker 1:          40:41          the, um, the other thing, the point about people getting online were only 50% penetrated, uh, globally. So when I was talking to Eric Schmidt the other day informed me I wasn't allowed to retire cause we're only 50% done. I have another 3.5 billion people to get online. So, so much for any, any retirement plans. [inaudible] um, I'm wondering, uh, about the facilities that you need in order to do the surgery. I mean, is this is, this isn't exactly like a field hospital thing, but I mean, what, what kinds of conditions are adequate in order to do this, this sort of surgery?

Speaker 4:          41:24          That's a good question because again, when you take a kid from the arms of a mom and her dad, you want to make sure that you give that kid back. It's a huge, almost sacred responsibility. You will. Um, so where can you take care of his kids in a way that is safe and Alfresco? High Quality Operation Smart has been able to perfect a model through standards that were created with experts from around the world to make sure that the right anesthesia machines, the right, um, uh, oxygen supply, the rive, anesthetic gases, et Cetera, et cetera are available. So we can actually go to a very remote hospital. And, um, she was asked where they'll burn room, there are lights on the oxygen and we bring actually everything else that that's required for that kid to get that very, very safe surgery at that time.

Speaker 4:          42:12          And we're very proud of that. But, but we're wanting to do is go beyond that. I mean, it shouldn't be an episodic thing or even in this, and we have centers that are download centers that work year round. But if I go to a very remote town and I, and I leave, am I taking care of x amount of kids? But, um, but I have to figure out a way to continue to help that town. Um, so our cofounder almost say, oh, it says, you know, kids with cleft lips and palates actually give us a chance to learn through them about the needs of their communities. Um, so we've started to actually get more engaged in, in areas related to safe, the safety of surgery, so that a lot of places that are very remote, um, I start to be an access to the proper anesthesia machines, instruments a supply so that not only their kids, but the family members can actually get surgery.

Speaker 4:          43:01          And if we do do help this system of health of a country, then it's less likely that they need, will be so overwhelming and then we can actually work together with either of those governments or the community. You know, a lot of people put the, the responsibility on governments and so you have to take care of this. But health, which is a right, it's a responsibility, responsibility that all of us share. Um, so everybody in the community can actually do something to create units like the ones that we create, um, in, in more remote areas and to make them be there for the long haul. What happens post up, I mean, you worry about things like infection and everything else. So how long do you need to keep the children in the hospital or somewhere where you can be, you know, avoid disease and infections and things like that.

Speaker 4:          43:51          So he's actually quite simple. When you take care of a kid with a cleft lip and palate, they can actually go home by the next day. That's amazing. Um, I mean obviously we have to make sure that there's proper coverage and the antibiotics, they have proper medications, but we actually, um, see them at the very least three to seven days after surgery to make sure that everything is okay. But you pose a question that is a big parcel for us. So we want to see their kids six months later, three months later, nine months later. But, um, if the kid has traveled 12 hours on a boat, on a donkey, on a horse or whatever, how do you make sure that you're able to see that kid again? And you're at ease that the, let's hope that the mobile phones and the camera's [inaudible] sort of remote diagnosis, remote

Speaker 1:          44:32          health care, uh, has this

Speaker 4:          44:34          Marlo the plane there Coreg bill and today what we do it, we still send teams out to actually make sure that the kids are great, but every single one of these actions requires time and resources. If we are able to use tools that enables to be more efficient and still offer really high quality care, then we can actually reinvest those resources in to taking care of more and more kids and train more and more people,

Speaker 1:          44:57          you know, would almost imagine that you've seen these photographs. It's dramatic. You would think that because of the dramatic positive outcome, this would stimulate interest in creating the hospital facilities in those remote villages. Having seen what medicine can do in this point and very dramatic case. And so that might, uh, might stimulate provision of better health care. And it's certainly a message to deliver to countries that are struggling with the health of their population. Um, let me just, uh, round this up unless there are other questions from others here. Um, and ask you once again, um, to tell us a little bit more about the opportunities that we have as individuals and maybe as a corporation to contribute to operation smile and its success. You mentioned quite a long list of things that that could be done. Is there a place on the website that says here are the things that we need people to do or to contribute or to take action about? Would we find out on the

Speaker 4:          46:08          website? And the website is mainly an awareness and opportunity tool. Uh, and that allows people to get educated and understanding this is a problem that can be fixed and allows us to have garlic, gather the resources. But this goes back to again, the same question and how to, is asking. It's like, how can we help? Which is a beautiful question to us. Certainly resources. Um, uh, and Google is very, very generous when, when, um, employees or staff or team members give a of their, the resources who will match it. It's, and that's one way to give, but, but there's more ways to engage. And if you think about it, and I mentioned this in an operating room, you have a doctor, a nurse, and an anesthesiologist before that moment happens, a lot of people have had to actually make a decision that that problem is a problem.

Speaker 4:          46:51          Uh, our cofounders, you shall assess, you know, love is a decision to make someone else's problem your problem. Um, so when we look at normally given resources, what do you have time it's, is, is, is important. So there are ways of volunteering. Um, you know, we not only have doctors and nurses who actually help us, we have many nonmedical medical volunteers who, who's doing, if somebody from Google volunteer, what would, what would we, what would happen? They couldn't help us with medical records. They could help us manage, um, the, the environment where kids or families feel very comfortable, uh, interact with them. Listen, we have the ability to not only offer care but actually transform a hospital that might be like a very, very dark place and to a place of hope. And that it's not something the doctors usually doing. So when we see a kid that comes in on an operating room and they just grabbed our hands and follow us, we know that many volunteers, I've actually made that kid and the parents feel welcome, feel care for.

Speaker 4:          47:46          I feel appreciate it with dignity. And that's what a lot of our non medical volunteers are able to do with us. And listen, certainly outline at a serious of potential opportunities for solutions to problems that are complex in the way we look at them today. Because my brain doesn't work the way you're still the US or, or, or our friends here do put. But I am sure that someone here or someone connected here, um, is already thinking about how do I make sure that people figured this out better? How to make sure that we can actually fix this problem. How do we make sure that we actually have avoid this from happening? What knowledge do I bring us as, as a, as an innovator that can tell great people, hey, you've been doing a good job, or we can make it better. We can do it better.

Speaker 1:          48:33          No, thank you so much Ruben, for telling us this story. It's, uh, it's all about human dignity and it's restoration and that's something we could all we for. So I hope that everybody who's out there listening and maybe watching this video later, we'll take the opportunity, take the opportunity to help operation smile, create some more smiles all around the world. Thank you so much.

Speaker 2:          48:57          [inaudible].
