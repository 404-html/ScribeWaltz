Speaker 1:          00:06          Thank you so much for, uh, for joining us, Luke, um, uh, you know, as her getting introduced where we'll definitely talk a bunch about, uh, Lee Hood, uh, based on the work that you guys, uh, if it's you, you, you, uh, put together. But, uh, I really wanted to start by talking about, uh, by talking about you and I was just asking you a moment ago, uh, you know, how often it is. I, I've seen any number of times you've, uh, you've moderated an interview or moderated a group of panelists, but how often are you on, on this end of the, uh, the interview?

Speaker 2:          00:36          Well, increasingly I am on the receiving end of these speaking on public radio from time to time, um, at panels. Sometimes people want to know at industry events, you know, what's, what's hot and interesting for the journalists. So, no, no. Perfect.

Speaker 1:          00:54          12. Great. I have a whole bunch of awkward questions here for you. Uh, so we'll just get started with a couple, a couple good ones. Um, maybe, maybe just, uh, just so folks know a little bit more about you, can you tell us a little bit about your background? Uh, you know, kind of how you, how you made the path from a, I think you grew up in Wisconsin, if I remember, uh, all the way to being a, a biotech journalist and doing amazing work you're doing now.

Speaker 2:          01:16          Yeah, sure. So I studied journalism at the University of Wisconsin. Wasn't sure what a I would specialize in or even if I would specialize, that wasn't really a thing in the 90s. It was coming up. Um, but, um, I ended up getting a job at the Seattle Times as a general business reporter. And, uh, uh, about a year into that stint I had shown some ability to explain, uh, jargony, boring kind of subjects to the editors in plain English. I could bring those things to life. And at the time the newspaper still had a biotechnology beat. Uh, they had a dedicated report on the business staff and, uh, I, uh, there were two openings. It's interesting. At the time I was about ready to get promoted and one was for biotech and Morton was for retail. So I could have cup of Starbucks, Costco, Amazon, and my whole path would've been different.

Speaker 2:          02:11          But I looked at biotech and I thought, uh, there's science, there's human health, there's business, there are ethical issues, there are all of these interesting characters, like charismatic entrepreneurs. It all changes really fast. There's no one dominant company. So in Seattle at the time of the business desk, uh, you wanted to get ahead, you would come, or Boeing or Microsoft and one of the big companies, but I kind of looked at some of the stories that were coming out of there and thought, Oh gee, another jet order for Singapore or you know, the, the latest version of windows. I thought biotech had rich ingredients for storytelling. And uh, so I kind of dived in. That would have been 2001. Uh, it was just in the wake of the human genome project. And I had, this is getting interesting. I could, I could imagine doing this a long time and not getting bored.

Speaker 1:          03:04          We'll come back to Seattle in a, in a, in a moment. Uh, cause I'd love to hear kind of what you've seen, uh, in, in the Seattle and northwest geography kind of a cause. There's obviously been a lot of change there, but, um, uh, but you then ended up at economy and then more recently you've started the Timmerman report. Ah, you had done the book, you've done, uh, the Po, there's a podcast that you started, uh, you had a brief, a bit where you're doing some stuff with stat news a, so just can you give us a sense of how you ended up at economy and then, and then really kind of, you know, your own entrepreneurial journey, uh, from going from a larger publication to going off and doing your own thing. How did you decide to do that?

Speaker 2:          03:44          Yeah. Well, um, this being Google, I mean, you understand the disruption that's occurred in the media business. Um, and so I was coming up at a traditional media company, the Seattle Times, and uh, realized that, uh, there wasn't much of a web strategy. And about the mid two thousands, they're still very much wedded to traditional print advertising and there were all kinds of painful cuts and things going on. Um, and so I thought, you know, I, I don't think this is for me a longterm, um, I was beginning to really sink my teeth into biotech and specialize. I had done a fellowship at MIT for science journalists for about a year, and that was sort of the moment where it was, it dawned on me that I could do this, I might need to figure out the right structure, um, online, um, to do that. And it's economy was that I joined a startup 2008.

Speaker 2:          04:42          Um, and, uh, it was really focused on all things innovative. So the two guys and a dog startup all the way up through the more interesting projects that say a big company might be working on and Alzheimer's. And it was a great window into the world of biotech. Um, I didn't have to worry about, you know, the daily stock fluctuations so much I could focus on the science and how it was being applied. And, uh, so I developed a following, um, social media came on board. Um, it became clear that I had sort of what you might call high affinity audience. I wasn't going to reach the largest number of people in the world with writing about genomics or you know, cancer immunotherapy. But there was a small core of people who were very intently interested in my subject material so that, um, by the time I was, uh, about to move on from economy 2014, I was thinking that yes, I could potentially hang up my own shingle as an independent media entrepreneur focused on my biotech niche and then I can layer in some of these other things like podcasts.

Speaker 2:          05:58          Um, eventually when I finally got my book published, I could get that kind of in the portfolio, um, as different ways to reach people in the, the information comments screen. So you started with the website and then, uh, in the background we're building the book, writing the book. Is that how it worked or how did you actually start that? I started the hood project while I was still at economy, but I like a lot of authors. I got to this point where I realized I've done all these interviews, I've got all these documents, it's a mountain of material. I've got all my daily deadlines, when am I actually going to write this thing? So I actually had to swallow hard and say, you know what, I think I need to leave my job if I'm actually going to write this book. Basically give myself a leave of absence.

Speaker 2:          06:44          Um, which was almost a year to actually write the book, finish it, get it edited. And then, um, I started the Timmerman report. Who was actually the book that prompted you to, to take the next step. Yeah. Great. Okay. That's, that's real interesting. Different than what I had thought. Um, so let's, let's, uh, let's turn our attention to the book. Um, so, you know, as, as, as I read through it, one thing that was striking and I as, as you know, I, I actually listened to it on audio books. I'm going to ask you some questions on that as well. But, um, but how did you come to the idea of writing a book to begin with? Is that just the dream of every journal is because I can't say that many of the folks that we interact with have actually written such a, um, you know, it's such a long form sort of a, you know, piece of writing and, you know, how did you come to choose Lee and how did the initial interaction, uh, with Lego, cause I can imagine it being easy or challenging cause he's such a unique finger in this.

Speaker 2:          07:38          How did, how did, how did it start? Yeah, so, um, I, I was starting to get the itch to write a book, uh, in the last couple of years at economy. Um, I had some experience writing magazine type profiles of people. I thought I enjoyed getting to know people and their life story as a way of shining light on the history of how technologies develop really. And um, along in 2011 comes the Steve Jobs book by Walter Isaacson. And I read this and I thought, now this is a great example of what you might call a living biography, uh, because he was able to do a whole series of interviews with jobs for last couple of years when he was still alive. And so you could get a lot of rich detail that you can never get just from reading the documentary record. You supplement the record with the interviews. And so, um, this is, you know, a big bestseller to it.

Speaker 2:          08:33          So it was kind of inspiring and I looked around and thought, okay, I'm in biotech who do I know who has had some kind of catalytic effect on this industry and maybe not as many aspects of tech that jobs did, but, um, immediately thought of hood. Now is you remember I was, I got started at the Seattle Times, uh, and based there and hood, um, had, um, I got to know him very early on as a newspaper reporter. So I had a reporter source relationship with him. Uh, I had covered his institute for systems biology, which was sort of his next big idea in the wake of the genome project. Um, and in various startup companies he had been involved in. And I knew that there was this tremendous force of personality and that he was, he had a signature achievement that I could explain to anybody on the street. And that was that he led the team that developed the first automated DNA sequencer. So this was a tool that revolutionized biology, we can say with the benefit of hindsight. And it was, uh, akin to the development of the, the better, faster, cheaper semiconductors that Intel developed, uh, more Gordon Moore and Bob Noyce had that kind of a catalytic and enabling effect on technology. So I thought hood was a great subject.

Speaker 1:          09:53          When you, uh, so you'd known him, uh, from, um, from your time on the reporting side of it. Uh, how did you broach that subject with him?

Speaker 2:          10:02          Yeah, that's a good question. Uh, because, uh, so looking at those of you who've read the Isaacson book know that it pulls no punches. There's the good Steven, but not so good Steve in there. And uh, you know, as an independent journalist, that's the kind of book I would write a, that's what I'll spend my time on. So I propose something like this to Lee and there's going to be a good lead in a badly in this book. I told him that I would talk to your friends and your enemies, your family. Um, I want to tell the good, the bad and the ugly. Um, I don't know exactly what I'm going to find at the outset. Um, but basically you need to put your confidence in me that I'm going to be fair to you, uh, that I'm going to do my best to get it right.

Speaker 2:          10:44          We're always going to see eye to eye. Um, and it turned out that at the time he had been thinking about writing his own memoir and it was kind of a, a difficult thing. Like, he was just going to hire somebody to do it and he didn't really have time. And, and he sort of looked and thought, okay, if you do this independent, um, uh, number one, more people are likely to read it because it won't be sort of the world according to Lee, a whitewashed version. Um, and, and number two, I mean, I think he had confidence in me that I knew the science and could put it in context. So he agreed to let the chips fall. I'll agree to all the interviews you willing to do. I'll open up my papers. So he was really good at, uh, at being cooperative.

Speaker 1:          11:26          So often you hear, uh, about about, uh, you know, biographies in that format. And I think that was even the case with Isaacson and jobs where there was kind of a tension or a debate it in it, but it sounds like he was overall, you know, open to it and actually relieved.

Speaker 2:          11:40          I have to read the book himself. Are there, there ones that I mean, but certainly there were tensions, um, especially getting closer to the end when you're fact checking some parts of the story that don't jibe with his version of, um, and he'd give us a couple of examples. Well, um, so it might be hard for those who haven't read the book, but there's a passage in here in which I report on how he was ousted as the chairman of biology at Caltech and that was not reported at the time. So when hood left Caltech in 1991, he was recruited by Bill Gates to the University of Washington and this was sort of like the dawn of a technology driven biology, biology becoming more data driven, more of an information science. He and gates shared this vision and it was a big story when, you know, this great scientists from Caltech came to Seattle.

Speaker 2:          12:37          It was in the Wall Street Journal and none of the underlying tensions of what really led to his departure from Caltech where reported. Now as a biographer looking at these things in the documentary record and interviewing people 20 years later, you can dig deeper and get into more of the story. And, and that was embarrassing and hurtful. And there were times during the fact checking process when Lee would try to revert back to the, uh, the silica, the cover story that Caltech was telling that enabled him to save face at the time. So we, we had some tensions. We had some battles, right?

Speaker 1:          13:13          Are those things, one of the things I took away as I was, uh, as I was reading through the book is that there's this element to Lee that I think is similar to some of the other great innovators of our time. Whether you think of a Steve Jobs, uh, you know, or an Eric Lander, kind of the variety of other, um, folks who we all kind of see, see in the media, uh, or in our companies and whatnot. Um, where there's a bigger than life sort of quality. There's a, this is the grand vision of what we're going to do, even though it may not be clear how we're going to do it at the outset. Um, as you spent time with Lee and wrote the book and thought through that came through in the book, that there's clearly that part to his persona. Um, did you find that that was balanced by some other part where it's like, you know, he also did produce the first automated sequencer, right?

Speaker 1:          14:02          That's a technical achievement. You know, how much of, you know, to the extent that achieving great things, uh, takes breaking through barriers and looking at the world in different ways in, in somebody's likely, you know, what PR, how much of him is grander than a grand and how much of it is, look, we've got to make the stuff work. Is it 50, 50, or, you know, just as you, as you dug into his persona, how much of it did you see? Or maybe there's a different framing a to it, especially as you've talked to some of these other entrepreneurs who have, uh, those parts to their persona personas as well.

Speaker 2:          14:32          It's a great point. There really are some common personality traits that you see in the people that really shake up a field and, and, uh, lead us to a new, a new path. And it really is this single minded intensity, uh, that, so first is the vision. Um, and he is a biologist first and foremost. This is, this is where he came from, that his training, uh, and he really wanted to answer big questions about biology that you could not answer. Uh, things like how is it that we are able to moat an infinite number of antibodies in our immune system to protect us from all these pathogens in the environment, the viruses, the bacteria, when we only have, we don't have a gene for every single one of those. How does that happen? Uh, they didn't have the tools for that, so he, he wanted the answer really bad.

Speaker 2:          15:28          And you know, he was, um, dedicated to using, to developing technology to, to run bigger, broader experiments to gather the kinds of data that you would need to, to answer a question of that magnitude. And, um, he just, once he developed the vision, he just had this single minded intensity and you can even see on the cover photo of the book, that photo captures it. Uh, it's, it's like this guy is in the zone. He's like, you know, tiger woods lining up for a Putt, or, you know, uh, Lance Armstrong on the, you know, in the Tour de France, uh, there's a focus, a purpose, and, and no buddies rules, nobody's bureaucracy. Nobody's, uh, sensitivities are going to get in the way of that goal. That's who he who he was. And so it was both his great strength and at times a weakness.

Speaker 1:          16:31          Yeah. Yeah. Which I feel like we see so much so often that those two things, um, both change the world, but also can be painful for the people around them. That must've come out as you were talking to the people surrounding we as well, just kind of the inspiration that they draw and, and

Speaker 2:          16:47          perhaps some of the challenges of, uh, of working in the environment that's created in that. That's right. Yeah. He, uh, he threw off a tremendous amount of energy. Uh, Roger Perlmutter, who is now the president of Merck research labs, had this great quote, and he said that Lee is like of the son. He throws off all of this is heat and energy and he draws people. He's got this great gravitational pull. He draws people into his orbit. They do, they're stimulated, they do a lot of their best work, graduate students and postdocs. Um, but, um, uh, it can be a little overpowering at times as suffocating in some, some cases

Speaker 1:          17:26          you invoked, um, uh, uh, the context of Gordon Moore and, and, and, uh, and kind of Intel and kind of the amazing work that was done to develop kind of infrastructure, kind of these fundamental tools or, or, um, uh, you know, components that kind of raised the whole field. And, and I, I think that that analogy kind of runs true, uh, uh, to the work hood. Did,

Speaker 2:          17:50          um, you know, kind of as, as you kind of think through, um, the, uh, the way that the various instruments that could develop unlocked biology. Do you feel like we're, we're, um, we're seeing the full vision of what Lee had had, um, envisioned all the way back then today? Or do you still feel like there's a lot more, uh, to be unlocked? Clearly we're seeing sequencing and all that sort of stuff, but there, are there other components of the vision that you heard from him that we're still waiting to see? Absolutely. Yes. We're still in the early days. And just for a little bit of historical context, I mean, you know this, you've read the book, but it, when hood was a really emerging on the faculty at Caltech in the 70s, uh, the first, uh, manual DNA sequencing techniques were being developed and these were slow, tedious processes.

Speaker 2:          18:40          A graduate student would spend his or her entire graduate school career and get a phd based on determining the sequence of just one gene. So five years, you determine the sequence for making something like insulin. Right now, today you can scrape off a skin cell and sequence the entire genome, the entire 3 billion bases that are, are you in me? Um, in seconds? Well the A, an entire genome and say a day, but like that gene would happen in a split second. So, you know, the, He v envisioned, um, automation coming to biology at a time when, um, the tools were very rudimentary in manual. And furthermore, there was a technophobic attitude within biology. There were people in biology saw themselves as kind of like high priests and we don't really do this sort of thing that we don't make widgets or tools. That's the work of industry.

Speaker 2:          19:39          Um, and so hood, uh, came in and said, no, we need to do both. We need to develop better tools to ask bigger and deeper questions. We need to gather new kinds of data and turn it into a bigger kind of information science. And he, he saw not just DNA sequencing but, uh, other layers of information being crucially important to like thoroughly understanding the whole organism. So, uh, he, he developed a, what they call them micro chemical facility at Caltech where they would, uh, they sequence proteins. They synthesize proteins, sequence DNA and synthesize DNA for instruments working in harmony that would, um, read and write in the language of life so to speak. And by looking at the different layers of information you could see, um, you know, how things go awry and become diseased in a much more granular fashion than, than you could before. You know, certainly, uh,

Speaker 1:          20:48          sitting inside of Google kind of, uh, you know, those four components. Uh, you know, you see some of, some of which have have totally transformed the industry. Uh, you know, it feels like there's still a, you know, more to come in. It's certainly from a, from a Google perspective, the role that, the amount of data that's produced from that set of instruments, uh, you know, is clearly profound and, and would suggest that there's other infrastructure, other tool sets that need to be built to manage it and help get to that underlying ability or that, that ultimate goal of a reading and writing in the language of biology. How much of that part of it have you seen? We hood kind of focus on having done all the instruments, you know, thinking about, okay, oh, there's all this data that's coming off the instruments. You know, I, I think you referenced a couple of things that he was doing, but, but where, you know, where did that research take you as, as you're thinking through now that these instruments kind of exist or parts of them exist? You know, what's next?

Speaker 2:          21:42          Well, it's a great question because you know, you can argue that we haven't yet, uh, reap the dividends of the human genome project and genomics or information rich biology whenever you'd like to call it. Um, because I think we're still very much in the early days. Uh, we're learning that biology is, even as you peel back more and more layers of the onion, it gets more and more complicated. So the gene sequence, as you know, it's not absolutely deterministic. Just because you have a genetic abnormality doesn't necessarily lead directly to the path of disease. There are other points at which, you know, proteins, cells, you know, you need to get a more full picture and we're not there yet, uh, of uh, and, and so there are efforts, um, in fact, Google's baseline project as one to try to, you know, better integrate, um, these multiple layers of information from genes to protein cells, but also your observable phenotype that's in your electronic health records. And we have some challenges with electronic health records in this country and interoperability getting different data sets to, to line up and talk to each other. So that's, um, that's gonna take years to two words.

Speaker 1:          22:59          True. I remember in the book you described a era of all, uh, which was a company that already has a company that, uh, hood had chest I think got launched maybe just as the book was, uh, coming to press. Any news about that? Anything that you've heard or, or cause it seemed like that was starting to get to some of these, uh, you know, questions around phenotype and how to tie all this stuff together with the genetic underpinnings.

Speaker 2:          23:22          Yeah. So for those unfamiliar, Arivale is accompany. It started another startup company that hood has gotten involved with, uh, and it's trying to bring about what he calls scientific wellness. So this is a big data approach to your health. They start with, uh, people see having their genome, their full genome sequenced, uh, but, uh, once, cause that's all you need, that's static set of information. But then periodically say once a quarter you'll get your money, you'll give a blood sample or spit, um, and uh, that will be analyzed for the metabolites. So what are the key metabolites that are showing up in greater concentration or another in your blood that might be sending something awry? A signal of disease perhaps? Uh, they also sequence your microbiome. We're learning a lot because of the tool that enables us to sequence all the microbes in say, a stool sample.

Speaker 2:          24:19          You can, you can get a sense of, uh, one's health, a snapshot. It's constantly changing, right? Because the composition of your microbes is influenced by your environment. Um, so, um, by, by gathering what he calls a dense dynamic data cloud. So starts with your genome, the Metabolome, the proteins, the proteome, uh, the microbiome. All of these ohmic levels of information get combined and, and hopefully by gathering all of this, they can see, say, a sign of an early warning sign of disease. So do you have something that kind of looks like it might be prediabetes heading on the road toward, um, you know, a more classic measurement of disease, like your hemoglobin a, one c being too high, you're, you're unable to control your blood sugar. Can we see, can we see it by gathering all of this information, there's going to be a lot of noise.

Speaker 2:          25:20          Can we find that signal? Can we apply computers to, to identify disease at a point at which we can intervene and potentially correct, uh, before it's too late? And so they, they've layered in a, what they call a wellness coach. So someone who works with, you know, a computational biologist looks at the data and says, you know, I think there might be a signal here, tells that to a coach who is not exactly, you know, sort of like a nurse practitioner who says, you know, Krishna, I'm seeing something kind of worrisome with your blood sugar. You know, you might want to lay off the ice cream before bed. Um, and, and if so, can we get, when we check a quarter after, can we see like that, that, uh, that molecular perturbation has disappeared and you no longer look like you're on the path to prediabetes. Now this is really pretty exciting stuff, but, um, it's not exactly being done. It's not done in the traditional context of randomized controlled trials that are the way at which, you know, we, we try to control for all the variables that might be influencing our health. So there's plenty of skeptics out there who say, you know, this is kind of interesting, but it's not giving us definitive proof that, um, that what you're doing is really working. Right.

Speaker 1:          26:45          Um, I did want to get back a little bit to the, uh, the Seattle and kind of the various sorts of geographies. You see. Um, I'll, I'll turn to the audience in a little bit and ask a couple questions. So, uh, Qsen thoughts up here in a moment, but, uh, but you know, on your website you mentioned that you've been through a two bosses and one and a half booms I think in the, in the biotech sector. Um, and I would assume that we're kind of still in the middle of a boom, uh, from your perspective. So would maybe be curious your perspective on, you know, where we are in a cycle here, having lived through a few yourself. Um, but I'd also be really curious, I mean, you mentioned, you know, there was a world, uh, when you started your career where Microsoft and Boeing, where the big industries in Seattle, where are things today, uh, in Seattle and then, and then how are you seeing the various geographies that you spend time in? The big ones that I think of are of course Seattle, the bay area, you know, San Diego, New York, Boston. Do you spend time in all of these different geographies and what, what are you seeing since you kind of perhaps more than most have, have a spectrum of, uh, insight across, uh, what various companies are up to in academics?

Speaker 2:          27:49          Yeah. Yeah. So first question about the boob. Um, yeah, I mean, we reached a peak there in the summer of 2015, um, where there was, you know, kind of a, a record number of FDA approvals. There was a record amount of venture funding. The stock markets were, we're all riding high. Um, and uh, then came Martin Shkreli and some drug pricing controversies, which scared some investors thought maybe, uh, the, the presidential election will go some direction that might clamp down on drug prices. So it, it fell down for a while. Um, now in the last this year, things have rebounded to some extent and we're now back on track again toward pretty close to a record number of FDA approvals. There are some very exciting drugs, which you know of. So I, I'm pretty optimistic that, uh, things are, uh, exciting things are happening with, with regularity. Um, a lot of it here in the Boston area now to, uh, to the geography question.

Speaker 2:          28:50          I mean, Seattle has been utterly changed in the 16 years that I've been there. The biggest one being the emergence of Amazon. Um, they now have about 40,000 employees in the city of Seattle and they've plopped them all just north of downtown. So there's a tremendous amount of, you know, bars and restaurants and you know, condos and street activity that, that wasn't there and kind of a previously rundown part of town. Uh, it's brought a lot of growth, a lot of good economic growth, but also some growing pains, traffic and housing prices as familiar story to many, uh, tech clusters. Um, but, um, as for biotech, I mean, I, um, I remain based in Seattle and there's a terrific base of research there at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and the University of Washington in a few other nonprofits. The Gates Foundation is there and leading the charge on infectious disease.

Speaker 2:          29:49          Uh, but, um, I get to Boston and San Francisco and the most, uh, because these are the top two biotech clusters. So I'm meeting with companies and scientists and investors in those two places quite a bit. Um, San Diego as well. New York once in a while. Um, the, the way biotech has grown as an industry, we, um, it does tend to concentrate by geography around great academic research centers. Uh, great hospitals. Um, and then the money in the entrepreneurs and then all the service providers, all of the consultants, the law firms, the, everything that you need, the regulatory affairs specialists, everything that you need kind of needs to be in, in one place. So that's the way it has evolved.

Speaker 3:          30:40          Let me see if there's any questions from the audience here, wondering if you looked at any of the new, uh, diesel therapies that are coming out of that. Yes, yes.

Speaker 2:          30:51          So, uh, for those unfamiliar on Novartis, one FDA approval just a couple of weeks ago for the first, uh, car t, uh, immunotherapy, um, in this, uh, this is a therapy in which patient with cancer blood cancer, uh, has white blood cells withdrawn. They go off to a company lab, they use some gene therapy to reprogram the receptors to recognize a specific marker on cancer cells. And then they reinfused those, uh, those t cells to go in and kill the cancer. Um, and the, they have seen extraordinary results in small groups of patients with blood cancers, something like 80% complete remission rates in kids with a acute lymphoblastic leukemia. So, Eh, this is a very exciting development. I mean, we just don't see 80% complete response rates, uh, in, you know, serious cancers with traditional small molecule or targeted antibody therapies. So, uh, and furthermore, we're beginning, we're starting to gather the longterm followup data you need to say, yes, this is actually lasting.

Speaker 2:          32:00          Uh, so very exciting moment. Um, and uh, there are lots of La, there's been an incredible boom, this is part of the story of the last five years is that immunotherapy has really come to the fore in cancer. This is no longer like a fringe science idea. Um, it's, it's the main stage of cancer. Every company that's in cancer, every cancer center is focused on how can we redirect that power of the immune system to go after the cancer cells. You actually have a feature on your website Timmerman report. If our call that was a review of every company in the Immuno space done alphabetically. If I had gone, it was like, it was pages and pages of companies and I was like, this is amazing. Uh, you know, how did you put that together? That seemed like just an uh, you know, superhuman level of effort to put that amount of um, uh, data together.

Speaker 2:          32:56          And I was looking through it and thinking, oh my gosh, like it's just the only way to organize this is, is alphabetically. It is. Cause every, everyday there's a new company in this space. It really is hard to keep up with all of the scientific approaches, all the companies getting money. Um, so yeah, I found myself scratching my head and saying, how can I get a handle on this? So why don't I just go a toZ and try to find as many companies as I could. And there was something like 180 companies and I just wrote short profiles of each one of them back to back along with some links to, you know, primary sources where he might be able to gather more specific information on each and almost as many immuno therapy companies. Is there a video sharing companies? I think.

Speaker 4:          33:46          Sure. Two quick ones. One just about leave it. I'm just curious that the back in the day, do you think any part of that is the conflict? What was rid of the traditional, you know, science? That's a

Speaker 2:          34:06          a great question. And absolutely, yes. So Hud, um, because of the scope of this vision as it was really, uh, as he was bringing in the resources and the people to make it happen, his lab grew. Uh, he started colonizing more and more space on campus. Uh, he was the chairman and you know, he saw like all of this as being part of his grand quest didn't necessarily pay a lot of attention to what the small science, uh, people in the faculty, um, what their priorities were. Um, and so he, he ended up, it, it evolves when you have 60 or 80 people in a lab and the guy down the hall has five or six graduate students working on some very narrow, esoteric problem. Uh, you know, it's, it challenged the whole culture of the way caltech operated or really any university for that matter.

Speaker 2:          35:05          The principal investigator led model with five or six graduate students has been irrelevant for a long time and it's given us a lot of good science. So people in the small science world looked at this and thought, what is this? I mean, how can you even adequately supervise these people are, who are they? Are they tenure track faculty or are they, you know, are they pro like employees of like a little copany? Do we actually have like a little company now inside of Caltech? Um, it was, it was strange people and, and, and it clashed with a lot of the identity of the Cole Caltech really saw itself as this elite institution doing these rarefied yeah.

Speaker 4:          35:42          Things after and after he was at Caltech, you know, we've talked before about journalism been disrupted by various changes. Do you see academia that he says being disrupted? I mean, obviously the Dapps it's pretty smart people, but only to like, oh, let's see. In terms of academic straddling that line in biology between, you know, the large invention type laboratories or the source that you have, you're in Cambridge versus what was more classic elite investigators.

Speaker 2:          36:24          I would say that these two forms can now coexist more easily. Um, so, uh, small science is still alive and well. Well, I mean, it has, it has, it's, the model is still intact. I mean, there are challenges to it. Uh, with, uh, the NIH budget, I'm constantly under pressure. Um, but big science has carved out more of a place for itself. Big Project driven that's a little more industry like occurs at a place like the brode. Uh, that's fortunate enough to attract philanthropy, uh, that, that can look a little further out at a longterm goal than say your classic Aro one NIH grant, which is more on a three to five year timeframe to show some results. Um, you know, I mean, but there's a lot of tension still between the two. I mean, there's the whole data sharing question. Um, you know, a lot of principal investigators, I mean, they make their, uh, their name and their field by getting published in science and nature and, and, and not by, you know, dumping all their raw data out in public databases for other scientists to, you know, gather and learn from in real time.

Speaker 2:          37:36          So we have a t a serious time lag problem in academic science. Now, big science has still has that cultural issue, but I think to a lesser degree, I'd be curious to hear your thoughts on that, Krishna. But you, you know, you see some cases of uh, you know, bigger institutions, I think they might be more inclined to lead on this and say, you know, like, uh, Daniel Macarthur over at the brode institute, some of you may know he's a, he's got this database for exomes 60,000 or even more, uh, uh, collections of big datasets that from each 60,000 individuals who have had scans done on the 2% of their genome that makes code for proteins. That's pretty useful. And, um, he is actually able to advance his career by putting this out in the open and then letting other people share in that resource. So I think we're beginning to see some, some cultural changes between small and big science, but you know, change is hard. It takes a long time. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          38:45          Is it a piggy back on that last question, if you can look in your crystal ball looking into the future and biotech based on what you know about Seattle? No. And you said the mindscape is fundamentally change because of Amazon. Do you think biotech could work? Is moving to Seattle, San Francisco, Boston, Cambridge are definitely helps, but we're becoming crowded, very expensive. Is there a room there? Is there a willingness there to sort of expand beyond Amazon into buying tech? Or do you think it's going to stay the Hans, you're going to stay in San Francisco? Cambridge,

Speaker 2:          39:24          I think a Boston and San Francisco are a head and shoulders above the other clusters and will likely remain that way, um, as the rest of our lifetimes. Um, there's so much historical, uh, momentum behind the basic research to clinical care, the venture capital, the history of entrepreneurship, that human capital pool that's here. I'm in a place like Seattle. You have a few pieces of the puzzle, but not all of them. Um, you have the basic research that's world class. Um, but, uh, you know, I didn't mention this, but when I started covering the industry, uh, there was, uh, a company called Immunex, uh, which, uh, developed, uh, the drug called Enbrel, which was still to this day, the 20 years later is one of the top five bestselling drugs in the world. It's really a major step forward for rheumatoid arthritis. Other drugs have come forward since then, biologically enabled.

Speaker 2:          40:22          And um, the company wasn't able to hold on to that. It ended up getting acquired by Amgen. A lot of the assets and people moved elsewhere. And so Seattle is like a lot of these other hubs of biotech that doesn't, it has some aspects of what you need. But, uh, in this case it doesn't have the, the pool of sales and marketing people or executive tailored that venture capitalists typically what to see before they see new things. Um, and you have that in a place like Boston, Cambridge. Um, so, you know, I'm sure Krisha has no shortage of people that you can imagine running startup companies here in Boston. Yeah, yeah. We're surrounded by them. I, I'm curious, I mean, if you were to zoom out a level, um, and look at the biotech industry, uh, over the time you've been covering it, you know, ah, there's the gigantic a Pharma entities, uh, you know, that we all know the Pfizers, the Roche, the Mercks, uh, you know, um, there's the small companies that we finance and that, uh, you know, aren't doing exciting, a new science. Maybe some of them are public, usually, you know, uh, call it, you know, billion are under

Speaker 1:          41:34          sort of market caps. And then we have kind of this interesting array of companies, um, like vertex cell gene. I mean Gilliad I mean, these have become, these are companies I think we've seen go from kind of startups to kind of, you know, small midsize companies to like, they're becoming pretty large companies. And some of them have done deals that are billion dollar acquisition is $1 billion deals and they can kind of do it without breaking too much of a sweat. Uh, you know, if you were to dial the clock forward, just given the context you've had over all these years, you know, what do you think happens with those companies? You think they get acquired by the big entities? Do you think that they, you know, grow up a lot of them kind of, um, and I'm sure you've, you've been on the receiving end of all of their pitches as they kind of to talk to you about various announcements. They all have kind of, I think the framework of, look, we're going to be the next mark. We're going to be the next, uh, you know, Genentech, Roche. Do you believe it? Do you believe that those companies are kind of grow into the next, uh, big behemoths are, you know, what do you, what do you think happens with those folks?

Speaker 2:          42:34          You know, it's a great question. I think maybe it's a minority of the time. Maybe one fourth of the time those visions are, are realized by a company that gets over the Hump and develops a new drug. I mean, just getting one drug over the finish line as an FDA approved product. And, and, you know, really helping patients and getting adequately reimbursed and making good money. I mean, very, very few companies ever get through that funnel, um, and even fewer can do it twice. So, um, you know, this is that the company down the street Alnylam pharmaceuticals is a good example. So they've got RNA interference, gene silencing technology. They, they did, they locked up a lot of IP early on. They raised a lot of money, uh, broadened smart people and 15 years later they just now have the phase three validating data necessary for treating one rare disease. Uh, which looks like that's going to be a drug now they can start making money. Um, but that really is not enough for them to become an enduring entity. They need to do it at least one or two more times to get diversified like a Celgene or a Gilliad. Even Gilly and Celgene have their diversification challenges. You, you, you look at how they make their money and often it's, it's one big thing you that does it for the

Speaker 1:          43:58          even, I mean, just, I mean, just to call it out. I mean, even for the cell genes, the Gilliads, um, the vertexes, I mean these are companies that are actually pretty big. Um, but to your point, like they still ha they're not fully diversified. And I guess that's maybe that's one of the questions like, uh, you know, there's the, there's the Alnylam is, and can they make the leap into becoming a commercial organization? And that's something that, I mean, obviously John's a phenomenal, phenomenal leader, you know, uh, you have adios, similar, and I think you wrote an article about this. Like, you know, that shift in culture from being an early stage r and d company to becoming a commercial organization, that's its

Speaker 2:          44:31          own challenge. Even after you have the successful drug that's been approved, can you kind of convert the company and to a commercial organization? When you look at these, this next level of company is the Vertex is sell jeans. Um, you'd Giliad's which have like maybe a, you know, a small number of assets that are producing huge revenues, do you think that they will be able to get to that diversification? You think there's just as much risk there? Uh, as you see on the early stage side of it? Yes. Um, I mean it's sort of like the old saying, you know, getting to the mountain top is, is hard, but staying there is even harder. Right, right. Um, you know, Regeneron pharmaceuticals is one good example of a company that's now got, I think six approved drugs and they're laying the foundation for genomics based drug discovery.

Speaker 2:          45:19          Like really trying to link some of these layers of information that I was talking about earlier to try to create something sustainable, something that can, with some degree of predictability and reliability roll off a new FDA approved drug once every couple of years. I mean, I mean it's still monumentally difficult and expensive and things are going to fail for reasons that you can't fully understand even after you spent years and millions of dollars. Um, but, um, I, you know, the companies that I think, you know, are able to invest in enough pieces of the R and d puzzle are the ones likely to endure. Um, you know, I think in Alnylam and Regeneron and these are companies that have a shot because of the, the investment in the basic science, but often you see companies where that's not even the intention at all. You know, they just, they take an asset out of Pfizer that looks like it has some promise and it needs some focus development for maybe 10 years. And that's all the goal is, is to get that one drug approved, sell it to a big Pharma Company, ends up dollars, reward the shareholders, and then the management who's exhausted. We'll go sit on an island somewhere.

Speaker 2:          46:34          Let me see if there's any other questions. I've got a couple of others lined up here, but anybody else?

Speaker 4:          46:40          You were talking about Seattle and Austin clusters. What do you see around the rest of the world as far as centers?

Speaker 2:          46:48          It's a good question. So, um, the UK has some, um, biotech infrastructure. Germany is another, uh, some in Japan, but the vast majority of new drug discovery and development occurs in the u s uh, there, uh, you know, part of it I think comes back to the decades of investment from the federal government, the NIH in, in creating centers of excellence. Um, but also, um, you have an entrepreneurial culture where, um, it's, it's okay to gamble your career on one of these projects and maybe fail and you know, as long as she had, you know, don't defraud somebody along the way. You know, maybe you can try again. Um, that's part of our culture. We also have a stock market that is very receptive and open to these very high risk, high reward propositions. Um, and that's not true in other countries. Um, where, you know, there's a little more reticence around, you know, losing all of your money, which does happen. Um, so, you know, we could have a longer conversation about this, but there, there are special ingredients in the United States that have enabled this to be the place where a lot of this activity occurs. And now that's not guaranteed to last forever. I mean we're doing some things that, that, you know, like with immigration for instance, that, uh, that could threaten our, our lead, it could force some of this activity to go elsewhere and it very well some of the ingredients are in place in other countries. They could, they'd be happy to take it.

Speaker 1:          48:30          I know you're in town, uh, to, uh, to do a bunch of things, but, uh, but as a venture capitalist I'm obligated to ask you about, um, the, uh, the panel you're running later today about how to avoid vcs and get the money you need, but they actually think it's a phenomenal topic. I thought you were going to ask you about your portfolio coach that's coming next hour. We do that offline that there've been, um, but you know, I, you know, there is kind of this interesting dynamic developing where there are kind of a new sources of capital coming into biotech and maybe it's because we're in this boom cycle of it. Um, but you know, I think you've done that panel in other, other settings or maybe what do you, what are you seeing kind of out there, aside from the traditional venture approach to financing, uh, you know, these risky, you know, crazy sort of companies. Um, yeah. What, what, what, what other sources of capital or are there,

Speaker 2:          49:18          well, I think you hit it on the head. The reason for this is that biotech has had a good road. There were about three years in a row where it outperformed the s, the s and p 500 and the Nasdaq composite index. So anytime that happens you get more money flowing in and saying, Gee, I'd like to out perform the market too. And so traditional VC has been around forever. And these are the folks who, you know, they raised money from pensions, endowments, uh, limited partners, corporations, corporations. Um, and so they're out there raising new funds every few years. That's one form, the really the dominant long lasting form of venture capital. But there are all these other types out there like corporate venture capital. So GV is an example where you're not out there raising money from endowments or pensions. You've got some money set aside.

Speaker 2:          50:08          Generally. I mean they come in different flavors, but some money set aside from the parent company that says we will, you know, we will gamble some of this money on biotech startups. That's just part of our mission. And some of them will pay off in some won't just like any, any venture capital firm. Um, but we have our reasons for doing this. Um, then there's also this emergence of a disease related foundations. Yes. So the, these are nonprofit groups that in many cases have an interest in a specific disease area. Um, and they fund basic research. But I think in the last say five to 10 years, a lot of them have recognized, well, that's not good enough. So if you're, say the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's research, um, you can invest in, you know, the bright researcher down the street at Dana Farber or you know, Harvard medical school and that's great.

Speaker 2:          51:02          But their work is ultimately going to lead to a published paper in the New England Journal of Medicine. And again, that's great, but it doesn't go all the way to a new Parkinson's treatment. So how do you get there? Well, maybe you could take some of your money and make equity investments in a spinoff company that, that takes that asset out of that lab. And so many of them have realized, can we, you know, can we set up this sort of equity investment component within our, our charter, the gates foundation does this for all kinds of immunology related companies that may have an application for vaccines in the developing world that the foundation cares about. But it also may be useful for cancer. And that would be like something that traditional vcs and corporate vcs can, can all get together on. And you know, so, um, you're seeing disease foundations, corporate venture funds, uh, but also, uh, now family offices.

Speaker 2:          51:58          So this is sort of the wealthy, the billionaire phenomenon. Uh, something like a Peter Teal who, uh, you know, it says, Gee, I'd like to, I can start a company, a biotech company. That's, you know, all I need is, you know, a bright scientists and, uh, you know, a team of advisers. Uh, and what do you need, you know, 10, 20 million to, you know, run the next set of experiments. Um, go, go give it a shot. So you got a lot of different kinds of, of new investing entities. I haven't got so many more questions for you.

Speaker 1:          52:29          Uh, but uh, but I'll, I'll ask you them, uh, you know, probably in another setting like this. Um, well thank you Luke, for, for taking the time to talk to us both in the room and all the folks, uh, virtually here. Um, you know, you, you started things off by saying that she kind of, you know, you could've gotten to a variety of different areas of journalism and you kind of picked this area because of all the exciting staff and people in it. Uh, I think your book does a phenomenal job of describing that. So many books in this space, uh, are kind of a slog to get through yours. It was just a joy. So hopefully everybody a out there and in here gets a chance to experience that. I thought the audio book was phenomenal as well, but uh, uh, but thank you for coming and hopefully we get to do this more often as you write more books. Thank you very much. Pleasure to be here. Here.
