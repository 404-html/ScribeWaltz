Speaker 1:          00:05          So I'm pleased to introduce Dr Eric Chudler who has a bs Ms and phd in psychology from Udab where he's the executive director for the center of since sensory motor neural engineering at the udub. He's a research associate professor in the Department of bioengineering and anesthesiology and pain medicine. He is investigating the neuroactive properties of medicinal herbs and plants to help treat neurological disease. And Dr Leads Johnson, I hope I pronounce both your names correctly. I didn't. Oh, great man. Um, who, who is a research scientist in the department of neurological surgery. She has a bs in physics and a phd in biomed biomedical engineering. She is broadly interested in ECR based brain based brain computer interfaces, specifically in how the brain changes in response to training. They both share a passion for helping improve science literacy and education as well as developing the next generation of scientists. They here to talk about their book, Brain Bites, quick answers to quirky questions about the brain. Please join me and give them, give them a warmup.

Speaker 2:          01:17          [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          01:23          okay, well thank you David and thank you to a Google for inviting us here today. Uh, all that stuff that David mentioned introducing us means that we're really interested in how the brain works. Both Lisa and I are are neuroscientists at the University of Washington. Uh, we work at the center for sensorimotor neuroengineering where we're developing a bi-directional brain computer interface to help people with neurological problems, especially those with stroke and spinal cord injury. And today we're going to talk about, uh, how your brain works. So maybe we'll take it back to your high school or you're a university level, uh, neuroscience courses of your biology courses. We'll find out what you know about the brain, but just be a quick introduction to the brain. And then, uh, Dr. Johnson and I have picked out two of our favorite things to talk about the brain. I'll talk about, does the full moon make people go crazy?

Speaker 3:          02:16          And then we'll get some of your opinions as well. Uh, at least we'll talk about a brain computer interfaces. Uh, and then we'll just open up for questions. Um, so, uh, the plan is to introduce your brain and when you think about the brain, uh, the brand does about everything. Uh, that's important to you. So, uh, right now I'm moving, I'm speaking, my heart is pumping, my lungs are going in and out there. I lost my mind for a little while. Sorry. Uh, uh, but you bring it does just about everything that's important to you. Uh, it controls your emotions. It controls all your movement. And Crow controls were five senses. Even though sense is that we don't even think about our brain is helping us do. So if you go ahead and put your out in front of you, and if you're wasn't your brain telling you to put your arm out there, if you couldn't see your arm, you still get information about where your arm is.

Speaker 3:          03:08          Because after a while your arms are gonna start hurting, right? And so that part of your body is your muscles. So your muscles have sensory organs in it that sends information to your spinal cord and up to your brain. Also in all of your joints, your joints have sensory receptors and them to tell where your arms are in space and your legs are in space. Uh, hopefully the words coming out of my mouth though, sound pressure is changing and it gets into your ear, your ear, then your eardrum vibrates. If those three bones, your ear vibrate, they send messages to the auditory nerve that are getting to your brain so that you understand the words that are coming out of my mouth. Uh, so the brain is really, I think, the most important part of your body. And you really can't do without a brand, uh, like you can do without other parts of your body. And I think it's the most interesting part of the body. So can you live, for example, without a kidney? Yeah. You can live without a kidney. Can you live without a couple of feet of intestine? Yeah. You got, you know, 20 or so feet of a test you could do though. Can you live without your heart?

Speaker 3:          04:08          Yeah, sure you can. You can live without your heart, right? You can't live without a heart. Right. And what about brain? Can you live without your brain? Can you maybe, maybe, maybe not, maybe not, not, not, not yet. Not yet. Uh, and, uh, an interesting, uh, question comes up that is if you could take a brain and you can take this brand and you can put it someplace else, would you be where your body is or would you be where your brain is?

Speaker 4:          04:40          Do

Speaker 3:          04:40          Neither. So some people would say, neither. Some people would say, I would be where my brain is. Some people would say, well, no, my body is who I am. And that's when I see myself, that's who I am. And some people would say, maybe you're not, uh, maybe you're somewhere in between. A one project that I've been doing for the last six years is that from going to India where I've been teaching Tibet and Buddhist monks and nuns, western neuroscience. And the first question that they asked me is, uh, Doctor Chub Lou, when, uh, when you die, where does the mind go? And I said, that's it. That's a really interesting question. Um, but as a scientist, I don't have an answer to that. Uh, as a scientist, I need to devise an experiment that will test that hypothesis. And I don't know, an experiment that can be done to test that hypothesis.

Speaker 3:          05:27          So what happens when you take a brand and you put it someplace else? Where is the mind to, I don't know if I don't have an answer for you at this time. Um, but if you look at the brain, we know that when you change the brand, you also change various aspects of the mind. And one very important part is this outside rind of the brand. Does anybody know the name of this outside partner? We were channel your high school or your, your university nursing. What's that? Uh, not time for the cerebellum yet. Cause it's folded outside. Part frontal cortex would be the front part of the brand. And so in general, this general area without the frontal would be the, that would be the cortex. The cerebral cortex and cortex comes from the Latin word, meaning bark, not of a tree, but of the bark, the outside rind of the cortex.

Speaker 3:          06:14          And you can actually see how that camp of that cortex kind of does cover that entire part of the brain. Uh, so inside the brain we also have a strip here. It's not labeled here, but this is that a 200 million axons, which connect the right and left hemisphere. It's got two words to it. Both start with the letter c, anybody that's the corpus callosum connecting the left and the right hemisphere. And this area here, it's uh, it's sort of central. It sends information up to the CORTEX and also gets information from the spinal cord as well. Kind of a relay sensory information to various parts of the CORTEX. The cortex also receives part of it. It doesn't make me the name of that starts with the letter t, t. H that's the founders. That's right. That's the Thalamus here. And so if that's the thalamus there, below the thalamus would be what? That would be the hypothalamus. Thank you. And this part here, the middle part of the brain and neck, it's a big hint. It's the middle part of the brain. So it's what,

Speaker 2:          07:15          okay,

Speaker 3:          07:15          the middle. What's that?

Speaker 2:          07:18          Hmm.

Speaker 3:          07:19          So obviously the midbrain, that's what it's called. That's the midbrain there. And then this cauliflower like thing on the back. If I was juggling, lean on one foot and hopping up and down, this part of the brain would be very active. Also helps me with my balance and posture. Now is the time for now's the time for cerebellum. So that's about 10% of your brain and the cerebellum here. And then from about this area to the top of the spinal cord, it would be like the bottom part of the flower, which would make it the brand that would make it the brainstem. And inside the brand step is one area called the Medulla. And uh, for them, some of you that are old like me, may have seen the movie with a Adam Sandler. How many have you seen waterboy come on, you can admit it.

Speaker 3:          07:59          Now I have to watch all these movies for scientific reasons, but there's one, there's one scene in, in waterboy with uh, the, uh, professors talking about how, uh, alligators have a large Medulla Oblongata. And if you remember this scene, uh, he says it's, they have a large, we do a lot of work on and that's why alligators are always angry, implying that the medulla has some important function for emotional behavior, which I don't know if, I don't know evidence that that's true. So I would suggest not to get your science from especially maybe adding Sandra or Hollywood. Uh, and now what about the Brian? This is an average size, a model of the brain, uh, about how much is an average adult human brain where,

Speaker 2:          08:37          all right,

Speaker 3:          08:38          so I think three pounds and the other guesses, two and a half, two and a half kilos. So that's about six pounds or so.

Speaker 2:          08:47          Yeah.

Speaker 3:          08:48          Any other guesses?

Speaker 3:          08:51          One of those answers is correct. So, so, so on average average adult human brain weighs about three pounds, almost three pounds. And I always bring this up and, and I guess no one ever saw it about two years ago on TV, there was a TV show. It was like a drama. And I don't know if it was a drama or a comedy, it was called three pounds. It was on for like three episodes, I think on CBS. Anybody see that movie called three pounds? Now? Nobody's watched. That's why it's not on anymore. It was all about a neurosurgeon and then called it three pounds. I assumed because the adult human brain weighs about three pounds a. What about gender or sex? Are there any differences between male and female brain weights? You take a brand new prop and on a scale and you weigh it.

Speaker 3:          09:33          On average, our average male brains heavier than male than female brains or female brains heavy than male brands, or do they weigh about the same? So raise your hand if you think on average an average adult male brain weighs more than an average adult or female brain. So a few people. How about on average female brains? Way more than male brains. And how about on average? The way about the same. Okay, so let's look at some, um, some real data. So on this graph here, on the x axis is how old someone is on the y axis is brain weight. Three pounds is about 1.4 kilograms. So you can see there, uh, the red bars are male brain weights and blue or female brain weights. What does this graph show?

Speaker 3:          10:19          So females have smaller brands in men. I want showed this graph to a group of fourth graders and the fourth graders, they were able to understand the x and the y and they can see that some bars were bigger than the other and they can see that the red bars were larger. And I called him this little boy and I said, what does this graph show? And the boy, you know, he's very confident. He raises his hand and he says, this graph shows that men are smarter than women. And I said something scientific like, uh, you know, that's a very interesting interpretation of this data. I don't know exactly, I don't know exactly what I said, but I, you know, I didn't want to make fun of him and I didn't want to say who, you know, you're wrong, but I, I did say that this graph doesn't say anything about how smart someone is the same graph.

Speaker 3:          10:59          I showed her a group of science teachers and one of the teachers, she was giving me the, Oh, you know, raising her hand and not letting me speak. And I say, what's wrong? You know, you have to take a cell phone call, you have to go out, you know what's wrong? And she said, you should never show this picture. And I said, why should I show this picture? This has been published a long time ago. It's been replicated many times. This is, this is a fact. Why shouldn't I show this picture? She said, you're trying to show that men are smarter than women. And I said, this graph doesn't say anything about how smart somewhere knows. And in fact, this next graph has exact same data, but it's plotted how large the brain is in proportion to the whole body. So this is brain body ratio.

Speaker 3:          11:36          So how large the brain is in relation to the whole body. So if I weigh 150 pounds in, my brain weighs three pounds, that means my brain is 2% of my total body weight. Now when you look at the data, there's almost no differences. All right? Uh, and, uh, even this graph doesn't say anything about how smart some, because look, a newborn baby and newborn baby's brain is 13% of their total body weight. And so, uh, you, uh, who anybody here who has a little infants at home or have seen babies know that those babies have giant balloon heads, right? Little bodies, right? Their brains are 30% of how much they were. And so just because, uh, someone has a large brand, has a larger brain from a portion of their body says nothing about their intelligence. Uh, we are not the animals on earth with the largest brains.

Speaker 3:          12:23          Uh, elephants, dolphins and whales have large absolute brain sizes than we do. We're not the animals on earth with the largest brains in proportion to our bodies. There's a several animals. One is a hummingbird. Hummingbirds have larger brains for their body. And there's another little African knife fish. It's only about this big. And, uh, again, tiny, tiny little brains, but in proportion to their body, they're larger than they are in us humans. So it goes to the question, what does it mean to be intelligent? And we can talk a little bit about that after as well. So the brain, uh, is made up, is about three pounds, 1.4 kilograms. It's made up of special cells called neurons or nerve cells. And there's a whole lot of those 86 to 100 billion. We're just rounding up to a 100 billion, but what's, what's 14 billion between friends, right? Uh, and they have those special parts.

Speaker 3:          13:13          They have dendrites receive information from other cells, uh, from other nerve cells. They send that information to a cell body, cell bodies connected to a long Axon, which is a neuro fiber, which then can branch two terminals at the end. And those terminals are very interested because to nerve cells to communicate, they don't actually touch, there's a gap, a physical gap between new to nerve cells. So when the terminal of one cell a wants to talk to a dendright of another nerve cell, there's a space. And so for one nerve cell to talk to the other nerve cells, the first nerve cell must release the little chemical neurotransmitter. You've probably heard some of these dopamine, Acetylcholine, Gaba, glutamate, Serotonin, those are all types of chemicals that are stored in the terminal of a nerve cell. So each neuron is like a little battery and then it generates a little bit of electricity.

Speaker 3:          14:05          When that electricity gets to the end of the nerve cell, it constants as chemists calls to come out, those chemicals cross that small little space. They're picked up by receptors on the dendright of next nerve cell, which can then increase or decrease the likelihood I'm an electrical signal in that next nerve cell. And that's how signals are sent in your brain, electrical signals within a nerve cell and chemical signals between nerve cells. So if you don't remember anything, uh, else that we have to say today, if you just remember that I, I'd be very, very happy. Okay. Electrical inside of a nerve cell and chemical between nerve cells. So let's talk a little bit about what our brain does for us. Uh, some of the basic things are taking in sensory information from the outside world, processing that information and sending a motor response act on that sensory stimulus.

Speaker 3:          14:53          And this is just a couple of animals that do things with their senses better than we can do. For example, in the upper left there is a cat. What can a cat do with it? Senses better than we can do. So they have a good sense of balance. Yeah. So, uh, don't do this, but if you have a cat at home and you drop it, uh, it'll probably land on its feet because it has a good sense of balance. Yeah. They can also see in low light they have a good sense of smell and very good sense of hearing as well. Uh, how about that? That Butterfly, what can a butterfly do? Is it senses better than we can do?

Speaker 3:          15:25          They can see infrared is one. Yeah, that's right. There's one more as actually nick, not infrared. Ultraviolet is they see it, they see ultraviolet. They can do one other thing in a much more sensitive than than we can do smell. Yeah. They have a, they can detect very low concentrations of certain chemicals, pheromones in the air that we don't know that's there. Uh, what about a shark? Sharks have a particular sense that humans don't have it all? Uh, yeah, we can smell, but, uh, I heard someone say that they have, they can detect electricity in the water, uh, not because they use refrigerators or electric razors, but because they have the ability to detect, uh, electricity generated by, uh, muscles. So that's one way that they can find prey is by detecting electricity. Uh, put off by muscles. A infrared is those snakes a dolphin's navigate with, um, echolocation sonar or the emails also have electrode receptors, a chameleon I put up there because, uh, some chameleons, you know, they, they had their eyes on stocks and they can put one eye up and one or down at the same time.

Speaker 3:          16:30          I've have no idea how they put together that visual picture, whether they see split screen or whether it's unfocused or I don't know what they see. Owls, owls, we have a good sense of sight and also a good sense of vision. But our senses are also very easy to trick. And so what I want you to do on this one, how many of you have heard of the stroop effect before? Just a couple of years. So good. And so what I want you to do is I'm going to point at these colors and I just want you to say out loud what color you see. And these colors are just normal colors. For example, the blue, it's just blue. It's not a royal blue or dark blue or navy, it's just blue. Same with the green is not Jello Green. It's not lime green, it's just green. And really try, don't, don't mess up the person sitting next to you. Really try to say what color you see. Some people see this as purple. Some people see this pink, I don't care. It's whatever you see. Okay. So follow the bouncing ball and again, say out loud what color you see. Okay. Ready? One, two, three, go. Blue.

Speaker 5:          17:42          Good.

Speaker 3:          17:42          So just to, just to test that one more. Uh, so I wonder why aren't you doing this one? What I want you doing. This one is do not read the word. Tell me what color the word is. Printed it. So this one on that word is printed in black on that color that's printed. That's green, right? Do not read the word. Tell me what color the word is printed there. Okay. Ready? One, two, three. Go.

Speaker 5:          18:09          Right.

Speaker 3:          18:19          I just checked it. Let's do it one more time. First two are blue. Red, right. Okay, here we go. Ready? One, two, three,

Speaker 5:          18:29          go. Blue.

Speaker 3:          18:43          Not so easy. Now let's try one more time. Let's try this one. Ready? One, two, three, go.

Speaker 5:          19:01          Three.

Speaker 3:          19:03          So why can you do this one and you couldn't do the other one because are you getting the same information on this one as you did from this one? Because look, that's red. Red. This is green. G. R. E. E. N. Y. Can you do this one and you couldn't do the other one? Aren't you getting the same information? Why can you do this one? We can't do the other one because of course, right. It just shows that, that we're not so good at multitasking. And just the simple ability of being able to read interferes with our ability to name the color. Can anybody read Japanese? So if these were Japanese Kanji characters for color, would you be able to accept for him? Uh, would you be able to, uh, read the color that you see? Yes. Because it has no meaning to you, but because it has meaning to him, he would probably have the same difficulty.

Speaker 3:          19:54          Right? Uh, what I want you to on this one is I want you to stare on either this one or the other one right there with a turquoise, black and yellow means I want you to look right there and keep on staring there for about 10 seconds off. Countback so keep on staring there. Keep on staring. I'm going to count backwards. If you blink, go back to that same spot. 10, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. Keep on staring. Blink once or twice and you should see something there. Now what's different than what you were staring at? So raise your hand if you saw the flag of Canada. Yeah, I mean you saw the red, white and blue flag. So, uh, is there a red, white and blue flag up there? Somebody said yes. No I, there's no red, white and blue flag up there.

Speaker 3:          20:46          Cause made this slide and I never made it and I never put a red, white and blue flag up there. But you still saw a red, white and blue flag. But will you agree that it's not there but you saw one. So where is it? If it's not that, I would say it's up in here. And what is happening there is when you stare at that Turquoise, yellow and black flag, you're adapting the visual system to those turquoise, yellow and black colors. So when you look at white, you're seeing white minus. That input from I took was the other one black and your brain interprets that as red, white, and blue. Uh, how about this one? Now you know that they're kind of illusions that are fooling your senses, but does that square look like a perfect square or does it look like the tops and sides are kind of bashed down? Yeah, you kind of see that it squeezed in, but even though that you know it's an illusion, it's very hard to not see that illusion. How many of you on this one see a upside down white triangle? Yeah. So if there's an upside down on white triangle there, now where is it now?

Speaker 2:          21:47          Yeah,

Speaker 3:          21:48          cause I never did anything to a white triangle. All I did just now was removed black lines and now I just added black lines. So I never edited a white triangle again. You see a white triangle. Is there a white triangle up there?

Speaker 3:          22:04          Some of you are going like, and some of you are, I don't think know what's going on now. Yeah. No point triangle here. No white square and no white square. Uh, I see a white square and this one I know there's a white skirt because I put it there. Um, so I would claim that that your brain is just trying to help the, that's what the brain is doing. It's just there to help. Now how about this one is a, was going to go completely across that a rectangle. Would it be a perfect match with B would be a perfect match with C or maybe I'm trying to trick you and it's lined up somewhere in the middle or on either side. So raise your hand if you think that egg would would be a perfect match with B. Raise your hand. So speed people over here. How about it's a perfect match with C and how about I'm trying to trick it and match up with anywhere. See Timmy, Timmy, Timmy, this is, this is fascinating because here we have about 30 or 40 people. You're all looking at the same thing and you're coming up with different answers and it didn't seem to be that everybody over here said, hey everybody over here said B and people over here said seats. It was kind of distributed around. Why? If you're looking at the exact same image, are you coming up with different answers?

Speaker 3:          23:21          Because it's ambiguous. And so maybe I'm also, maybe I'm also leading you, so, so for example, uh, if to, to lead you again, go ahead and put your hands, hands like this. And now what I want you to do is point your thumbs at each other and now keep on rotating around, point them down, and then take your right hand and put it under your left hand and interlock your fingers. And as your fingers are, point them out like that. So you don't, yeah, I don't hit anybody in front of you. Yeah. Okay. So with your hands, like this pointed out in front of you, now all I want you to do is rotate like this.

Speaker 3:          23:58          Of course I did. Of course I did. Uh, but again, it's just because, um, uh, because uh, a little distraction altered the way that you think and altered the way that you perceive. And perhaps that's the same with this one is because you have certain expectations and your brain is just trying to help you make sense of the world. So it's uh, it's actually a bit, so maybe I was trying to trick you by trying to trick you by trying to trick you. All right. Uh, and as I said, the brain is just trying to help. So even though your brain doesn't get all the information it needs, you can still read the sentences. For example, the top line says what? And the bottom line says, yeah, and the brain is just, they're trying to help you. So even though your brain doesn't get all the information it needs, it is just there to help. So I want to turn this over to Dr. Johnson and she's going to tell you about one of her favorite things. Brain computer interfaces.

Speaker 6:          24:52          One of my favorite things, I don't know, raindrops and roses are red thing right there. Um, so Eric asked me to put together some slides that would be probably interesting and kind of about the book and I thought we should talk about brain computer interfaces because it's very topical. If anybody's been reading the news this morning, there's some stuff about brain computer interfaces and also cause I thought this might be sort of a tech friendly crowd that you guys might be into. Some of that. So when we talk about brain computer interfaces are BCIS, there's usually two categories that we think about it. So the first would be motor bay, Spring food, your interfaces, and then sensory, which would be kind of the opposite. So when you're talking about a motor based Vci, the first thing we need to do is measure the electrical potential. The brain.

Speaker 6:          25:34          And if you guys were listening while Eric was talking, he said that our brains use electricity to communicate, which is true. And it's also extremely convenient as engineers because we know a little bit about electricity, right? So we know how to record electricity, we know how to produce electricity and that gives us some options for interfacing with the nervous system. So once we've measured that electrical potential, then we need to decode the signal. So often when I give this talk to kids, I say, it doesn't come out in English and it doesn't come out in Spanish. And it's like a revelation to everyone in the room. What does it come out as? Um, and I had a woman come up to me one time after I gave this talk at a bookstore and she said, how do you do that? Really? How do you do that?

Speaker 6:          26:13          Um, and it turns out that you need to do a lot of signal processing in order to do that. So when we talk about decoding, what we're really talking about is looking at the time, frequency analysis of the signal and trying to figure out how that corresponds to behaviors that we might observe. Um, then we use that decoded signals to control an external device. So it's a bit of a misnomer to say it's a brain computer interface because sometimes the computer doesn't really get into the mix much at all. Then when we had the sensory device, we're usually going exactly the opposite direction. We want to measure a physical signal in the world. So a physical signal might be

Speaker 6:          26:51          light, right? We could measure photons. So we can measure sound and measure pressure. We can measure all kinds of interesting things about the world. We could measure IRR if we wanted to. Um, then we encode the signal into an electrical pattern, um, which is sort of trying to figure out the opposite of this problem and then electrically stimulate the brain. So one of the fun things about the brand is that if you pump a little bit of current and you usually get some sort of response on the other end, if you do it in the right way, then you can get meaningful sensory responses. Um, and because, uh, brain computer interfaces are generally thought of is therapeutic in some way, then that's what we want on the other end is a meaningful sensory response. Um, and while it might sound futuristic, there's some of these already running around out there in the real world.

Speaker 6:          27:38          Um, so let's go over some of the ones that currently exist. Does anybody know what this is right up here? Cochlear implant? Yes. Very good. Um, so a cochlear implant is a stimulating device for people that have profound hearing loss or deafness. And what you're looking at here is just the external portion of it, um, which has the microphone and also some of the signal processing parts. And then on the inside there's actually an array of electrodes implanted in the Cochlea, which is that snail shaped part of the inner ear. Um, and they stimulate through the electrodes into that space in the ear. It stimulates the auditory nerve and causes the perception of sound. Uh, these have been around for quite a while now, since the 80s, and it turns out that there are so good now that people can actually hear speech and identify speech even in the absence of visual cues. So for example, on a telephone, a person with a cochlear implant would be able to understand speech and you probably notice that this person is small and bald, meaning what? It's a baby. All right. So why would you put a cochlear implant in a baby?

Speaker 6:          28:50          So they will have the chance to learn how to speak, right? So we have kind of all of the facets of this answer going around. So the idea is that your brain goes through critical periods where you learn how to interpret different kinds of sensory information. And critical periods usually happen very early in life. I think I can say they exclusively happened early in life when your brain is developing. And if you don't receive sensory inputs during that period, you will never really learn how to interpret it. So if you don't get auditory information when you're very young, you just don't learn how to hear. You don't learn how to interpret speech. Um, and so they found that the earlier you can put it in the device in to a deaf individual, the more they're going to be able to understand hearing an auditory signals later in life. It's extremely controversial. Why?

Speaker 4:          29:40          Okay, sorry.

Speaker 6:          29:43          Because consent is an issue, right? And infant isn't capable of consenting. Um, this is, you know, it's actually a very minimally invasive surgery. Eye Surgeries go, but it is a surgery and a lot of people consider it an elective surgery. A lot of members of the deaf community consider deafness not really to be a disability and not really to be a problem that needs solving. Um, and I don't really have any great insights or solutions on this. I just pointing out this is in fact a problem that comes up, um, and brain computer interface land. Um, this next one down here we have a less young individual, um, with this particular implant. Does anybody know what this is?

Speaker 6:          30:27          Kind of. It's close. So it is a visual implant. A retinal implant. Yeah. So this is the artist two, which is developed by second sight. It has recently, I think 2013 received FDA approval. So there are people at various places in the country, very centers in the country that are actually implanting these retinal implants for people that have, um, total vision loss. So they're completely blind. Um, and the rental implant is like you might guess, implanted on the retina. Retinal Anatomy has sort of a strange naming convention. So front and back might not mean exactly what they seem like they should mean, but in any case it's implanted. Um, on the surface of your retina, that sort of touches all that gooey eyeball jelly stuff in the middle. That's where the implant is. Um, there's a camera right in the middle of these glasses and the camera is recording.

Speaker 6:          31:19          The visual scene is doing a lot of processing on that information to get it to, uh, sort of, uh, I can't remember how many contacts they have, but it's, it's on the order of like a hundred electrodes are on the surface of the retina and then it stimulates the retina, the, the remaining cells on the retina with that digital information. Um, there's a couple of conditions where this is really good. Uh, so if you have a what's called age related macular degeneration, then your photo receptors cells degenerate over time on the retina. That's one condition where this is an appropriate device. The other one would be retina and tie, retinitis Pigmentosa, which is actually a heritable condition where people also progressively lose their photoreceptors. But in both of those conditions, um, the rest of the cells in the retina tend to be preserved. So it's useful to have a retinal implant. It's not useful to have a retinal implant. It's her blind because you don't have eyes, right? If you lose an eye, retinal implant isn't going to do really all that much good. There are kinds of other visual implants that people are developing and you can have a cortical implant. There are some groups that are working on a syllabic implants. This is kind of a different idea. Um, does anybody know what this is?

Speaker 6:          32:39          Somebody said something, but I didn't hear what it was. All right, cool. Underscore substitution or vision. Exactly. That's totally what it is. This is what we call a tactile visual sensory substitution device, right? So the idea is you take visual information, he's wearing the really cool glasses, again, with the camera on the front, taking that visual information and turning it into a tactal input. So tactal input is what I'm holding in my hand so everybody can sort of touch your sense of touch. Um, and in this case, they're not putting it on the guy's fingertips because you use your fingers for a lot of stuff, especially if you're blind. They're putting it in this cool headband. Right on his forehead. I've also seen them on the tongue. Um, you can also put them on the back or the neck. Um, you have a different distribution of sensory receptors across the surface of your body.

Speaker 6:          33:30          So there are some places where you're going to get better acuity from this than others. Um, but this is also a kind of brain computer interface, a much less invasive kind of brain computer interface. Um, so moving on to motor kinds of brain computer interfaces. This guy up here, um, has a very severe spinal cord injury. Um, you can see he's actually on a respirator, so he has a complete transection of his spinal cord, um, very high. Um, and uh, so when I give this talk to students, I usually say, well, he was in a knife fight and the first thing we should learn from this is that nobody should get in a knife fight. Right? Um, and that's still good advice even if you're not a kid. Um, so this thing that looks like a plug that's going into his brain is in fact a plug that's going right into his brain.

Speaker 6:          34:18          Okay. So the scientists at Brown University as part of this research venture called braingate have implanted electrodes into the part of his brain that used to control movement of his arm and his hand. Um, and then when they record the activity of those cells, when he's thinking about or trying to move his arm or his hand, they turn that into a signal which controls a computer cursor on a screen. And this was really one of the first demonstrations of a human brain computer interface. And this group has continued to develop the technology and then now have people moving really fancy robotic arms exclusively with brand power and it's all very scifi and very cool. Um, so this is, uh, another kind of motor based brain computer interface. So, uh, this person obviously has had an amputation as a result of a motorcycle accident. So the lesson there is everyone would be very careful when you're riding a motorcycle.

Speaker 6:          35:15          All right. Um, and she's very lucky because she went to the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago and they tried out this new technique where they took the severed nerve stump that was leftover after the amputation and they pulled out the motor part of the nerve. Right? So you have, um, the, the nerves that are going down or, yeah, the neurons that are the axons of the neurons that are going down to innovate the muscles. And then you also have the sensory receptors that are coming back to give information to your brain. So they took out the motor part of that and they actually implanted it in the pectoral muscle right here. Um, and then after those nerve roots sort of grew back and innovator the pectoral muscle, when she thought about moving her arm or her hand, it actually cause contraction of that muscle. Um, and then they can put electrodes on the surface of that muscle delay detecting the electrical activity of the muscle and then use that to control this really tremendously complicated robotic arm.

Speaker 6:          36:10          So now when she thinks about moving her hand, the robotic hand actually moves, which is super cool. And then also got sort of a bonus with this and that the sensory nerves also grew back and innovative that pectoral muscle. So now, um, when you press on different parts of that muscle and the skin overlay now muscle, it actually feels like somebody is pressing on her fingertips, right? So then they can instrument the arm that can put pressure detectors on the fingertips and she can actually get sensory feedback. So we actually have a closed loop brain computer interface and that's nice. Um, down here is another kind of motor based brain computer interface. So this is a for people that have high but not very high level spinal cord injury. So it's for people that have a c six or c seven level injury. It comes out of the Cleveland Clinic in Cleveland.

Speaker 6:          37:02          Um, and it's actually called the free hand. And the idea behind this is that they implant electrodes right into the muscle bodies. They have seven electrodes that get implanted into the muscle bodies in the arm. People that have that level of injury, that c six c seven, they have movement and their shoulder and they can usually extend their elbow, but they can't grasp or on grasp their hand. Right? So what they can do is stimulate those muscles. When you stimulate the muscles, they can trapped. Um, and if you do it in the right order, you want, you get on the other end are functional, isn't it? So it's called functional electrical stimulation. Um, so what they're able to do, even with seven electrodes, it's not nearly as many electrodes, is you have muscles in your arm and you have about 30 muscles controlling your arm.

Speaker 6:          37:45          So seven is just a small subset of that. They're able to give people a few different kinds of grass. And even with those few different kinds of grass, people are able now to really enhance their independence, right? So they can brush their teeth where before they couldn't, they can feed themselves, they can do all kinds of ivy if even seen pictures of people playing tennis with the [inaudible] system where they couldn't have done that before. Um, so unfortunately this device is no longer available. And one of the reasons for that is because it's only useful for people that have this very specific level of injury. And why would that be the case? Yeah. [inaudible] um, that's a good point to think about sort of spasticity issues. Um, and that's specificity is always an issue when you have a spinal cord injury. Um, and it's also very unpredictable, but that's actually not the case. That's not the, it's not the driving factor here.

Speaker 6:          38:58          Right? So the economics are the reason why it's not broadly, you know, commercializable. But the reason it's only really useful to people that have this c six c seven level injury is because these people can move their shoulder and shoulder movement is important because there was no brain part of this device. You have to be able to communicate with this device in some way. Right. And so the way that they did it, as they put a joystick on the wheelchair with the contralateral soldier shoulder and they're able to move the joystick by moving their shoulder around. So recently, there have been some people that have tried to sort of connect this with this to connect to the whole brain control interface part with the muscle control. There's a group at all Ohio state that did it. A proof of concept does this, um, last year. Um, so that's sort of the state of the art and brain computer interfaces. And I think Eric wants to take you a different direction.

Speaker 3:          39:52          Yeah. Just, just the opposite direction. At least brought you all the way to the future. I'm bringing you all the way back to the past way in the past where for many years people have looked up to the moon and have assign blame to the moon for many different reasons. So we get the word lunacy, right? The root word lunacy comes from the word Luna meaning moon. Right? And for many years people have tried to assign blame to the moon for things like traffic accidents, uh, domestic violence calls, uh, poisoning, suicides, murders, violence. And these data are relatively easy to extract, right? You go to the police blotter, you go to the Almanac and you can see what phase of the moon and match it up to a particular day and count how many accidents or traffic accidents or, or what. And there've been a close to a hundred different studies looking at a lot of these different behaviors.

Speaker 3:          40:46          And there's no evidence to suggest that the phase of the moon affects behavior in any way. Now that won't dissuade many people. And in fact, uh, at my house, we had someone over at the house, I won't mention her name, uh, but she, uh, is in law enforcement and you know, at my house somehow, I don't know how we end up talking about the brain. Don't ask me how that happens. But, uh, and we, the, the full moon came up and she said, Oh, uh, you know, uh, you know, when I'm out on patrol, uh, I pulled more people out of the ditch and I go to more domestic violence cases when that full moon is out. And I said, well, don't do things happen at other times of the month. And she said, well, yeah, it happens, but I just don't notice it. And I said, exactly.

Speaker 3:          41:30          Because if you look at the literature, you'll find that almost no correlation between the phase of the moon and any of these unusual abnormal behaviors, uh, and really, uh, the physics of it don't make sense to you do that. The gravitational pull of the, uh, on the earth just don't match the, uh, in, in the human body. So there's really no reason for it. But the people that have the strongest beliefs that the moon does affect behavior are people in law enforcement and medical personnel. And my hypothesis is that these professions that are high stress jobs, that they see bad things happen, they seem horrific accidents. And if they can assign blame to something like the moon, then it relieves stress from him. Now I, that's my hypothesis. Whether it's true or not, I don't know. But again, if you look at the types of professions, and there have been studies about who holds the strongest beliefs at are those and very high stress positions. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          42:36          Yeah. So that's, that's one hypothesis is why, why did, why did it originally come up? And some people said, well, maybe in the old days before there is artificial light, uh, the artificial light provided a thieves and robbers and, uh, more, uh, light to do their nefarious actions. And then the police could also see them. Uh, and so that would cause, so that's one hypothesis about why, but why that might be why the myth started, but why it is skill exists when we have artificial life, it doesn't really make sense. Um, so why that, why that's the case? Uh, we don't really know for sure. Um, but, uh, that's the end of our formal presentation. I just want to again, thank David and, and Google for having us, uh, our publisher, Norton and company and also the center for sensory motor neural engineer who both Lisa and I work. So, uh, we have time for some questions. Uh, you know, now it's kind of your time, uh, that you know, there's something about the brand and you didn't know if it was true or not. We might have an answer for you, uh, or something that, yeah, we won't, we won't make one out. Um, but, um, if there's a question that you have now as a time to ask,

Speaker 7:          43:45          so there's a lot of information online about the pineal gland and specifically how fluoride supposedly affects it in some magical, mysterious way. Are there, is there any merit to these claims? What is the peanut Atlanta and how does it work?

Speaker 3:          43:58          Yeah, so the pineal Glen is a, is a, is a gland pineal comes from the word pine nut or pine. This is a little pine cone shaped thing right in the center of the brain. Uh, the long history of it, uh, is, uh, Dukart, uh, originally thought that that was the seat of the soul maybe cause it was in the center of the brain. It releases a lot of Serotonin. It might have some, uh, uh, uh, function in circadian rhythms and things like that, but I haven't heard anything about fluoride or its effect. I haven't seen any on that. Um, so the function of it, it's, it's a, it's a, not like a gland. Um, might have to do with some circadian rhythms and things like that, but I haven't heard anything specifically about flora as a neuroscientist. I mean the, the field of neuroscience is so huge that, uh, you know, I, I kind of know my area, but what's happening in other areas, it's very difficult with thousands and thousands of papers being generated every year. And in fact, you know, for the book, I have haven't, I know I wrote some of the quiet, the answers to the questions, but at least brings a whole area of expertise that I don't have a, and that's kind of like, you know, a question like that is, it's very hard to follow the most recent literature. Um, but I haven't heard anything about it yet.

Speaker 3:          45:15          So it's a, we are now able to decode a electrical information from the brain for things that like related to, uh, um, like our, our modem functions and, and sensory, uh, are we close to actually be able to do the same of decoding brain electrical information, uh, with the goats to higher level, uh, brain functions like, you know, memory and perhaps coaches thinking again and so forth every even close to that have you up to music about it.

Speaker 6:          45:45          Um, so I think it's, it's kind of an interesting question because, so there's a lot of different kinds of higher level thinking, right? So memory is a little bit different then like higher order cognitive function because there's a very specific part of the brain that we know is very involved in memory formation and people have been recording activity from the hippocampus. If I'm that Perry Hipaa Campbell areas for a really long period of time and can record a lot of how those memory traces are laid down and stored. Um, and in some cases they say that they can tell exactly what memories are being recalled at any given time. So I think in that case we're a lot closer than what we would be in some of the other higher order thinking. When you're talking about higher cognitive processes, you're usually talking about frontal areas. Um, and when I was in graduate school, we called it the prefrontal Cortex, right?

Speaker 6:          46:39          Like there's, there's so much stuff going on in there, there's so much association that I think it's really hard to piece apart any individual thing. Um, and so when you get down to this room more basic functions like motor or sensory, I think there's a much higher probability that we'll be able to decode those functions specifically. Um, which is, but you know, but there are certain things you can tell like, so for example, there's a, what we call the error related negativity, which you can record from EEG when somebody has made a mistake and they know that they've made a mistake in a task, you can record that. Um, when somebody sees something that's surprising and also meaningful to them, there's an EEG signature to that that people can record as well. So there are certain things that you can pick out, but in terms of just decoding somebody's thoughts or a stream of consciousness I think were really long way from that.

Speaker 8:          47:32          I have a question about one of the of this brain computer interfaces. There was a guy who this other stuff can to get spray and he was like [inaudible] a malls. Like of course our halls. So how does it or doesn't like a passion like four I looked throats good songwriting, rob them area of the brain or find like particular specific area. And so dusk you have to train that Shelia speak of all cell phones things or

Speaker 6:          48:01          right. So I'm in this case, they're usually implanting thinking Utah, right, which was developed in Utah. Um, and it has about a hundred electrodes on it. Um, and they're all sort of shaft style electrodes and you plant them all within one very small area of the brain. And in this case they really want to target the part of the brain that used to control and movement of the hand or the harm. Because the idea is that that will be the most natural way to control the device. So usually they would put the person in an Fmri scanner and then they would have the person to think about moving their hand or arm. And that gives them a way to localize the part of the brain that would be involved with that. And then in when they go into surgery, they try and implant that right there. Um, but there is a fair bit of training involved. Um, and it, it actually gets very complicated. You may have to train the device every day because the neurons surrounding the implant might also die or become inaccessible for other reasons. Um, so it's not as if you put the implant in and then you can magically just move your arm the way that you used to. Or you can move a computer cursor without effort. You do have to train on the device.

Speaker 8:          49:06          So normally we have the ability to ask, moving our arm without actually moving at this. Is this person using the sooner or interface? He just mashes moving. Disarm is the just that aren't really wants it to whatnot. Um,

Speaker 6:          49:24          that's a good question. Um, so when we imagine moving our arms, it's actually the same part of our brain is active is when we actually move our arms at least. So I should say the part of the brain that they're recording that same part of the brain is active whether you imagine or whether you actually move your arm. So presumably then if somebody had a brain computer interface that they were using every day in their life than if they just sort of imagined using it, that would also trigger activation of the arm. Um, maybe designers would think about that and implement some sort of on off too. I mean that's the thing that people think about it for other reasons. It's how can you inactivate your device when you don't want it to be working. Um, there's also, you know, there's just a lot of plasticity in your brain. The brain has a chance to change itself a lot. And I sort of would think, I would hypothesize that your brain might natively be able to overcome that particular barrier. Is it if you used it a lot? Oh, dreaming is kind of a hard one. But, so if you were in the phase of sleep in rem sleep where you have these vivid dreams. I kinda think so if your devices on,

Speaker 3:          50:39          okay. I've been, but that's an interesting question and it brings up additional questions that say that either you're dreaming and all of a sudden your arm moves, or if you're walking down the street and all of a sudden you're our moves and say it interests someone, maybe someone that's in the bed with you or you're walking down the street and then they had somebody that you don't know who's responsible for that injury that you caused with that arm because you were sleeping. It wasn't me that caused it. It with the arm just moved by itself. So who's responsible? Is it the person who's our moved? Is it the engineer who built the arm? Is it the physician who installed the arm? Or is it the programmer who programmed that arm or the, or decoded that signal and then sent that signal out. Who's responsible for it?

Speaker 3:          51:21          So these are questions that in this entire field that perhaps engineers and neuroscientists are perhaps not equipped to answer. And at the center for sensory motor neural engine where we work, we are actually collaborating with philosophers and newer ethicists and the Department of Philosophy at the University of Washington to ask some of these questions because scientists and engineers, sometimes we can do these things, but how should we do these things? And, and should we do these things are questions that we don't always ask before they're developed. And so we're trying to get some of these questions at least brought up and discussed not only within our own community but with the end users. Those people that will be the recipients of these devices, they should have some say in what they're going to do and what they can do and what they can't do and what they look like. Um, so these are, these are, uh, you know, the, the, the simple, not, not such a simple, but the obvious questions lead to many, many other questions, which are, or deeper on so many different levels.

Speaker 9:          52:20          So you mentioned giving this talk to Buddhists and I believe there was an interesting outcome of the Dalai Lama undergoing an MRI. Are there any avenues of research along those lines around self, brain modulation, etc?

Speaker 3:          52:31          Yeah, I, I don't know of the Dye Lama himself, uh, undergoing an MRI, but there have been, uh, there is research going on with Tibetan Buddhist monks who have come to the states, uh, and have been meditated in the scanners and they're trying to correlate some of the changes that go on in the brain during meditation. Um, to be honest, I don't know if there's been a lot of, uh, data that can be extracted to suggest how we can become compassionate like they are from, from the, from the literature. Uh, but that's ongoing research. And so what is the neural basis of meditation, uh, that might give rise to the neural correlate of consciousness itself? Uh, and you know, as scientists, we've always tried to externalize everything. You know, we, we measure it in other people, but consciousness and compassion, something that comes from within. And so maybe it's something that, that we need to look within ourselves and steady ourselves as opposed to studies others to maybe get to some of those questions. So, um, that, that research is ongoing. It's a relatively, very new, a line of research combining a meditation and modern neuroscience. And I think the data's still waiting to come on. Thank you very much for coming and answering a lot of questions at all.

Speaker 2:          53:52          [inaudible].
