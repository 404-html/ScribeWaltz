Speaker 1:          00:00:08       Uh, I'm Jonathan Rosenberg and I ran product management here for 10 years and I don't usually come and introduce speakers, but, and it's special. And so I came to tell you why since 2002 when I joined Google, my favorite days were Mondays for 10 years. Monday morning was Eric and Larry Staff meeting and I was surrounded by smart people with a mission that mattered. And in the afternoon I would run my staff meeting and my staff meeting was Sundar and solar and Marissa. And the second smartest was Jackie's sister. Is this being recorded? Susan, I love you. And in 2011, when all of that ended and I moved out of an operational role, I thought I'd never have exciting Mondays again. Then Susan introduced me to Ann and I started going to 23 and me's staff meeting and helping over there. So now on Mondays, once again, I'm surrounded by smart people and I'm in a company where the mission that we're, the mission matters, bringing personalized medicine to like make us healthier.

Speaker 1:          00:01:20       Like we care about being healthier. So the mission is terrific. The team is brilliant. It's a little bit different because more than half of the faces in the room are women and the CEO is a woman and Katie and Jessica are here. Some of the people who are in the staff meeting, in fact, more than half of the faces in the room are women. Even when I'm there, I'm doing pretty well. So rather than kind of go through all the Yada Yada of a traditional introduction, you know, like an is special. And she went to Yale and she spent 10 years doing like medicine and healthcare investing and is very googley look at the way she's dressed for her Google talk. So listen to an listened to her vision, listen to them talk and Jordan talk about some of the great challenges that she's faced, building 23 and me and many of the googly values that she's infused in this wonderful company and an you're the reason I get out of bed on Monday mornings. I love you.

Speaker 2:          00:02:21       [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:02:26       okay, I'll turn things over to Anna and Jordan.

Speaker 3:          00:02:33       All right. Can you guys hear me okay? Thank you for joining us here. Really appreciate it. And thank you for joining us. Of course, after an intro like that. So I know he can't beat that. So for the force 45, 50 minutes, I'm going to go with the questions that I took from the dory. So thank you all first mandatory questions. And then for the last 10 minutes we'll do mixture of live questions and dory questions. Um, but I to start off first with your relationship here with Google and your story that you were telling me about you and the cafe.

Speaker 4:          00:03:05       Yeah. So I honestly, I've known Google since the very earliest days. It started in my sister's garage. Um, so it was one of those things in, in the early days we'd be doing dishes and we could see Sergei and Larry coding and like the other bedroom. And I used to always say, it was like, it's really weird that you have these guys like just sitting in the other room coning while we're doing dishes. Like it was a really unusual, um, so obviously I've spent a lot of time at the company and I was saying how I'm 23 and me used to have an office, I'm on the shore birds, so just around the corner and we're, you know, like we're a startup, we're scrappy. And, um, so it was very apparent that, you know, Google had a lot of food. So we used to make our way over here.

Speaker 4:          00:03:48       And you know, back when there was Burrito's right downstairs, um, there was a great burritos and so they're easy to carry. So I would walk over every other Thursday and we'd have these team lunches and I just get like 10 burritos. And so I was walking out carrying like my mom mind burritos and I opened the door and I look, and it's Eric Schmidt and Steve Jobs. Okay. And I was like, oh, hi. Like, what are you doing? And Eric's like, what do you have to, I'm like, oh, just getting lunch. And Steve had just launched the iPhone and was like, have you seen the iPhone? Do you want to see it? I'm like, yeah, great. So, um, so I've had a lot of great experiences. Um, I'm obviously in such a huge fan of Google and a lot of ways it's had a huge influence on 23 and me and I think a lot of the values that I saw especially in the early days have really influenced how we run the company.

Speaker 3:          00:04:40       Now you were mentioning about your values and 23, me and you were telling me about your role, your relationship with your grandmother and your experience with the healthcare system. Can you talk a little about it? Yeah, yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:04:50       Um, you know, I think so as a background I used to invest in healthcare companies and um, you know, health is a really complicated industry and it's not necessarily always doing the right thing for the consumer. And I used to always complain like I actually the last fun, the last Hedge Fund I was at was a fun that we nicknamed Death Watch. And we used to just short everything cause it's really easy to predict failures and biotech, but it's hard to predict successes. And so I was like, kind of just like this really negative, like everything sucks in healthcare. It's all bad. It's all failing. It's like all about like, how do I just take advantage of the consumer? And I remember Larry Turning to me one day and he's like, and you're either part of the solution or you're part of the problem right now. You're part of the problem.

Speaker 4:          00:05:33       Um, I was like, oh, like that's true. Like in some ways I was a good slap of like, you have to, if you, when you see problems you need to do something to change it. And one thing that we've always, my family has always been really passionate about is healthcare. And part of this came from the fact that my mother, um, was, you know, she was very poor growing up and she had a little brother and when he was 18 months old, he got into a bottle of aspirin and he ate that bottle of aspirin and he was clearly lethargic. They took them from hospital, a hospital hospital, and my mom was five at the time. And, um, they were refused treatment because they couldn't show proof of payment. They finally got some hospital to take him and they took him. And then when my grandmother called in the morning, they said he was dead and it had a huge impact on my mom as it would have on any family.

Speaker 4:          00:06:20       And my mom at this time was like, you know, very clear. If you don't take care of yourself, no one will and you have to be responsible for your healthcare. So when I pulled my Kaiser medical records at some point, um, my sisters and I discovered that our records actually had an asterisk at the top that said, as all of us in pediatrics know, this mother can be very irrational at times. And as Jonathan has had some, some lovely times also working with my mom, my mom is a force. Um, and especially in health care, like we routinely get fired from doctors. We routinely or told people don't want to work with us. And I think it's one thing I've learned is like in some ways good healthcare comes to those who complain and you have to be really proactive. So it was one of those things like we were always a super proactive family, um, you know, understanding our health.

Speaker 4:          00:07:08       And it was one of the things that I think really bothered me when I was investing in healthcare is I realized how much the system is not set up for your success. Like no one makes money if you, um, if you live to be a hundred and you never are sick, no one makes money, you know, and healthcare is 18% of our GDP. Like clearly lots of people are making money off you being sick, but as a real problem. And so a lot of my passion for 23 and me when I started the company came from how much I said like I want to do something that's genuinely right that allows people to be active in their health and proactive the way my mother has always been proactive for me and that she's taught me to be proactive with my health. Can you talk about the first years of you building 23 me, the challenges you went through.

Speaker 4:          00:07:54       So we got lucky. Um, you know, I think a lot of founders like in something like Sergei and Larry used to say this, like they got lucky, they have the right place right time. Um, I happened to be, when I was investing in on Wall Street, I happened to realize like genetic information. It was suddenly cheap to get access to a broad amount of information on your genome. And um, you know, I was really lucky noticing like one you could get suddenly individuals could access to your genome and then there was this whole convergence of like web 2.0 like there's going to be social networks and you're going to find each other. And it was like hot. It was so interesting and it was my space and um, and it suddenly realized, um, one of the things that's a big issue in healthcare is there's a lack of data.

Speaker 4:          00:08:39       So I like routinely my sister other sister does nutrition research and routinely you look at those studies and it's like 200 patients here, 200 here. And My dad who's a particle physicist would be like anyone who knows about statistics. So it was like you can't find anything in that. It's like you need lots of data. And clearly the Google world had taught me like the value of like lots of data and what you can do. Um, so I got lucky sort of with this idea of why do I need Stanford? Why do I need Pfizer to go and do all this research? I can just allow all these people to learn about their genome. Like it's so cool. Learn about your genetics. And then we're going to bring everyone together in this whole new research model is going to be like crowd sourcing. We're going to have the world's data.

Speaker 4:          00:09:19       I don't need Stanford and Pfizer and all these other people. I don't want you to be a human subject. I want you to be alive, participant excited and research. Um, so we have this idea really marrying like this idea of cool technology with like this concept of like health, you know, web 2.0 and we launched the company. And, um, you know, initially I had this enthusiasm. I think genetics is so cool. Like I think there's nothing cooler than the idea is like, you have a genetic code. Everyone in this room is 99.5% the same. Yet we clearly have all this diversity and we don't understand it. Like it's like the, it's, it's like, it's a code. Like how does it, how do people sleep at night? It's so interesting and we don't understand it. And so, um, so I have this enthusiasm, um, but I started to realize that the rest of the world's not quite as passionate about genetics as I am.

Speaker 4:          00:10:11       Um, and so we launched and we had, uh, you know, we had this big spit parties, we had all kinds of press. Um, and then we sold probably a third, a thousand kits the first day. And then we were selling like 15 to 20 kids a day. And as everyone realizes like 15 to 20 kids a day, if not a lot of money like that is that is not, not even going to be a ramen profitable company like that is, um, that, that's rough. Um, so it made me realize like, we have to do a lot to help people understand like what our genetics, like most people, um, like really smart people would come to me and be like, oh, I don't want to know my DNA. I don't want to know the day I'm going to die. And I was like, if I can tell you the day you're going to die, charge you a lot more.

Speaker 4:          00:10:52       Like [inaudible] I was like, no, it's like risk, like, and you realize like most people don't understand risk. And um, so the thing that I've been lucky with is I have a team of people who join 23 and me because they're really passionate. And you know, my love for science, like I said, my father's a particle physicist and as kids, my sisters and I grew up always like realizing like we tell people like, oh my dad is like, he studies neutrinos, he's searching for mass. And people were like, what? Like what is he doing? And, and I just realized like I in some ways, like it always bothered me. I think physics is the most beautiful science out there, but like most people don't understand it. And I also like in genetics is similar. Like I really didn't want the fate that my father went through with physics of like, you know, lack of funding and all this.

Speaker 4:          00:11:44       Like I wanted the average individual to like see the beauty of the d of Dna and see it within their own lens and capture this idea of like, we're all most interested in ourselves. And so your DNA is really interesting to you. Um, so the people I hired in those early days, a lot of them are still at the company and they're really passionate about this idea that like, you want people to like, you want people to see that beauty. And um, and so I'm lucky because the fact that like, it was hard those first years, I'm like, we didn't have huge sales. It didn't deter people because of their, like, again, scientists are used to failure. Like, wow, you know, we just have to try this. We have to try that. We have to like try other strategies. So it was, um, you know, I'm lucky with that.

Speaker 4:          00:12:26       And also the science, you know, one of the things that we did with the company that was unusual is we weren't excessively marketing because we decided like, we wanted to really make sure that we have the science down. Before we did a lot of marketing and the one marketing thing we did, this is another funny story. Um, surrogate at this time, I don't know who's been here for how long Sergei was really interested in Zeppelins blimps. Um, and so there was a, there was a Zeppelin for awhile and Sergei didn't want to stick like a Google stickler on it. So he's like, I don't know, he could put 23 me on it. So we put, cause he wanted to sell advertising on it. So we put 23 me sticker on it and it got a lot of press that there was like a giant Zeplin flying around town.

Speaker 4:          00:13:08       Um, like tech crunch had all these articles. So that was like my one attempt before we had a marketing team. I had the blimp. Um, I'm no longer part of the marketing team, but we really focus like as a company to in those early days, we recognize like we have no business, that we don't have a scientific foundation and that the core of the company, like I needed to win over the scientists and make sure that they understand what we're doing and that are a pre, that they're supportive of what we're doing before I go big and start going on TV and started advertising. And in some ways that also really benefited the company because when there was controversy, I never had to worry about my core. Like I always knew the foundation of the company was really strong. I didn't have to worry. Like I understood it was misunderstood and all these ways, but scientifically I was always solid and I knew that.

Speaker 4:          00:13:57       Excellent. And we proposed a blimp idea. Did you have to bring it up to your board or something? No, I think, I think I just did it, you know, that's the beauty of a startup is like you don't even think about these things. I don't know, like I just, I just put it up there. No, I mean my board has always been, um, pretty small and I just like, I, you know, again, when you're a 10 person company, you're a 15 person company, you just like do things all the time that are kind of crazy. Like this. When we launched our spit party in New York, we had Barry Diller, um, host and like Rupert Murdoch, like all these people host the spit party. And it was on the cover of the style section on the Sunday style section. And I remember like, see like people like Eric Lander, like serious scientists who are like, it is so disrespectful to have science on like the style section, like this is not appropriate.

Speaker 4:          00:14:46       And, um, and I was like, no, like more people read the science sec where more people read the style section, they read science Tuesday, like this is great. So we were always kind of doing things, um, that were a little bit different. Like we wanted to do things not to say like the blimp, but the blimp was fun. Um, but we wanted to do things that were going to be atypical of what the traditional scientific world does. Cause like most people are not out meeting New England Journal in Science magazine. Like we want to bring science to the masses.

Speaker 3:          00:15:13       Excellent. Um, when I had been Horowitz here and we talked about the struggle that CEOs go through where it's just a really challenging time. Yeah. And you have to really fight through it to survive. Um, it seemed like the struggle for you as during that whole FDA period. Can you talk to us about that and then also what kept you going during that time?

Speaker 4:          00:15:31       You don't, I think, um, I think I've had two struggles in the company, so the FDA one was clearly, um, an important one and it was in some ways it was the most public and it forced us to really change our strategy. And um, you know, we got what happens, we got the letter and we got the FDA warning letter on a Friday and I was at a team offsite where in a strategy offsite we were like talking about like we have massive growth who are really excited. We were going for a million people. Um, and my assistant at the time texted me and she said, you ought, um, uh, a special, the like the, the FDA is trying to curry or something to you. And I was like, well, don't sign for it. Um, and I was like, I already did. I was like, aw, why did you sign for it?

Speaker 4:          00:16:15       Um, and then I was like, bring it to me and, um, and then we read it, you know, and we were like, we'd gotten a lot of warning letters in the past. Like we were kind of used to it by that. And we're like, ah, you know, whenever we got him all the time. Um, but this one was like a lot more serious. Um, and, and to be honest, like silicon valley is not known for its interaction with regulators. Um, so it, I was like, I think we were relatively naive. Like I get this question a lot, like, where are we just like so arrogant and we'd kind of given the finger to the FDA or where we just incompetent. And I think it's something we were just uneducated. Like we, um, like it took me a while even after getting that letter, cause then it was made public on Monday morning and, um, and people would read it and they're like, wow, this is like, like this is probably one of the most serious warning letters that's ever been put out there.

Speaker 4:          00:17:08       And it was actually one of the former heads of the FDA who called me and was like an like, they're not messing around, like you have to stop. Um, and, and it was, uh, it was, it definitely, it halted a lot within the company. And that first week I think I just spent the entire week in my pajamas calling lawyers. Like I just, I didn't move from my desk. I just called. And for me, I've always been very data driven. Like I just wanted all the information. So it was just pulling information like, what do I do? And we've always historically been really good at finding loopholes. Um, so for instance, in New York where we were not allowed to sell, we discovered that, um, it wasn't that you weren't allowed to sell and you just weren't allowed to physically spit in the state and was like, that's great.

Speaker 4:          00:17:50       People Been Spit in New Jersey. Um, and so we'd found kind of this loophole, like customers used to have to attest that they had not physically spat in the state. Um, and so I spent a lot of time figuring out like, what's the, like how do I work around this? And to be honest, like one of the work arounds today is that you put what we call sort of a doc in the box. Like you have a telemedicine doctor where you just can call, uh, or sorry. It's just like they are kind of like on the backend. Like you not even necessarily see it and they order it for you. And when you have that you can kind of circumvent, you can become a laboratory developed test. And there was one regulator in particular who, um, I met with and she goes, you know, and like what you're trying to do is fundamentally really disruptive.

Speaker 4:          00:18:36       Like you're trying to allow consumers to get direct access to care without having to go through a medical provider. And if you succeed in that, you can really have an impact, a real positive impact on the system. But doing that as not a work around it's hard work. Like either you decide you want to put your head down and you want to just like really get that work done or you find if you want to sell this company in a couple of years, like you do this work around and you're just like, whatever, you're just circumventing the system but, but you can change the system. And that conversation had a huge impact. And I said, I said, look like, well, I'm in it for the next, you know, I'm in it for life, so I'm willing to do the hard work. And you know, it took us, um, you know, from that moment, it was a couple of years before we actually got our first approval.

Speaker 4:          00:19:24       And the way we did it, people always ask like, what'd you do? And in some ways when you're in a hole like that, um, no one like the regulators did not trust us. And so the way that you win back trust, especially with an organization like the FDA is they speak in data. Like you guys probably all work with people who like, like they understand data, like show us the data and then we can make a decision. And so we did, um, you know, one of the other things I learned with the FDA to, um, I always tell my kids this, I learned obedience. Um, I learned that when you go to the DMV, you know, you don't argue about standing in line or you don't argue about doing a vision test, you just do it. You don't try to say like, oh, I just had one last week.

Speaker 4:          00:20:04       Here's the report. Um, you just do it. And similar to the FDA, you have to recognize, they sometimes know more than you do because they're seeing the whole picture and you just do it. You like, you negotiate, but you do the pro. You do what they ask you to do. And, um, in some ways by showing that we could be obedient and we could follow directions and that we had the data to prove it. Um, and we had to change a lot of things within the company to be a regulated company. And there's a lot, um, that we had to do from an engineering and product and design perspective to document how everything's happens. Um, and so again, it's been a ton of work, but it's fundamentally made us a much better company because our processes are much stronger. Um, so it was, um, it definitely was rough and there was a lot of, um, controversy within the company about whether or not this was the right path.

Speaker 4:          00:20:55       And I think as a leader of the company, when the most important things is to do is to allow controversy, you know, allow people to have to voice their questions. Like invoice it. Like, I think Google is one thing I learned with Google. It's like, you want to let people debate. Debate is really good. Um, but once you make a decision, everyone's on board. And if you don't agree, then it's not the right place. Um, but we had, we have a fair amount of debate and before, like we, I encourage that as a leader. I encourage that debate. And then once we make a decision and you can set a vision for the future and say, look, like we're, we're trying to fundamentally change the system, would like trying to empower consumers like my next day. Like, why do you have to go and get a doctor's order to get a blood test? Do you always need it for our prescription? Like all these, like the whole, you know, um, patriarchal system. Like why do you actually need, like, why do you need this physician or medical involvement before you can actually get some of this information? So we're really out for that bigger picture of like trying to change the system.

Speaker 3:          00:21:54       So for your current offerings, you offer the ancestry test and then you can get the health test

Speaker 4:          00:21:58       correct. So for two years, we, um, we just kind of, we, all we did was offer ancestry and we focused on pulling out the health information we've gotten. We have three FDA approvals now or authorizations. So we have carrier status. Um, we have genetic, which is things like cystic fibrosis. We have genetic health risks, which is things like Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's. Um, and then we have now the breast cancer variance, the three most common in Jewish women, um, or Jewish individuals that we test for those variance.

Speaker 3:          00:22:29       Um, are you playing offer more extensive testing like such as metabolic imbalances and enzymes? Like what like um, cause I have a Google or asking, oh, it was family members has chronic pain and I think

Speaker 4:          00:22:43       no, I mean we're focusing on DNA. Like if it's, if it's a genetic variant of a task that we could detect, like we're focusing just on DNA right now. Um, so we definitely think about partnerships that we could do that would have, um, you know, especially anything that we could do that's potentially at home where we could allow you to have at home collection and think about other tests that you're getting. For right now it's just focused. Like we're definitely looking to expand that, the tasks that we're offering. Um, but everything will be just based on genetics.

Speaker 3:          00:23:11       Excellent. Um, so given the large corpus of data you're putting together, are you, how have you been able to use this like PR for promoting cures or new developments in the field?

Speaker 4:          00:23:21       We do. So that was part of the hypothesis of the company is that if I collect all of this information and all of this data, can I then more effectively make discoveries, academic research discoveries as well as can I translate this information into drug therapeutics? So the drug industry, again, when I was running this, this one I was investing in companies and running that fund that I called Death Watch. Um, part of the reason why I could do something like that is statistically 90% of everything fails in biotech. So if 90% of everything fails, like you just short everything, like there's like you don't have to do that much math for like, it was just like you can predict failures. Um, so in, in the drug discovery business, it's the Pharma lobbying group is the only group I know that like would actively promote every year how it's more and more expensive to create a drug.

Speaker 4:          00:24:10       So like when I started investing it with $700 million to make a drug, and today it's close to $3 billion. So it's only getting worse. So the idea with all this data is can I in some ways more effectively use this data to, to translate it into drug hypotheses and then do I have a higher success rate for making therapeutics. So we are doing that now. We hired Richard Scheller who was the head of research and development at Genentech. Um, we have over 10 programs in development now. We've been doing this now for three years. We work with a ton of Pharma partnerships. Um, so we are actively trying to say, can you turn data into curative therapeutics? So we are actively working on that now. And my hope is like, again, because we're a scientific team, like I can say this and I have a hypothesis and I, but I can't make any claims yet, but my hope is in 10 years I can come back and say like, look, here's our success rate compared to industry averages.

Speaker 4:          00:25:05       And we believe that that success rate will come because we're starting with something that's data driven based on genetics, possibly a new business model for the users of 23 meals. So like if I provide you with health data, it leads to some type of cure. It's hard to translate. Um, the reality with drug development is that drug development is, um, it's a really long and complicated process. So at what point in time can I identify that? Like your participation made such a huge difference. So what we tried to do is say, like we learning from our customers. So for instance, in depression we did a study where we had 400,000 customers participate and thanks to the participation of so many individuals. Um, we were able to make discoveries in depression and then you potentially can analyze all those genetic variants and say these are these, this is one where we think this is potentially a druggable target.

Speaker 4:          00:26:01       Um, so it's really hard to do the micro attribution to say, hey, these individuals and plus it's like a 10 to 15 year process. So you might come back and say, hey, 15 years later what, what we have found is what people really care about. Um, like we had a community of individuals actually have someone from Google actually who we worked with who had sarcoma. She's like, I don't care. What I care about is a cure. Like I have sarcoma. Like I have a lethal disease. Like I would like to live. And um, I find people with serious illnesses like that. They care about two things. Like does this impact my children and I would like to survive. But me coming to you and saying, here's a check for $100. I'm sorry you're going to die soon. Like is not like it. Like, we want to do the right thing and everything at 23.

Speaker 4:          00:26:47       And me, um, all of our decisions that we make are about what is in the best interest of our customers. And my customer is always the individuals who signed up. And so we always think about everything from the perspective of like, you just participated in research. Like what is it that is in the best interest for you? And if you tell me, for instance, that you have, you have migraines and you have, um, you know, uh, you know, crones w we, it's our job then to help you figure out the best ways that you can participate in research or for us to actually move those things forward, to have some kind of impact in your life. And then you could potentially help be a control. There might be somebody here who's like, oh, I'm high, you know, I have a family history of prostate cancer and we have depression. And you can say, I can be a control for you. And, and that way everybody is actually helping each other. So it's hard to then point to well who exactly is responsible because the reality is really a community asset.

Speaker 3:          00:27:38       That makes sense. Um, for the survey aspect, when you're a member of 23 and me, they ask you questions. Sometimes you probably might get data that is just erroneous. Like do you use like multiple data points to figure out?

Speaker 4:          00:27:49       We do. One of the things we found, so this is a good example in um, we asked, we put out questions to our customers. So we ask, we have a pretty comprehensive survey that we first ask everyone to take. Um, and sometimes you have to refine the question. So in this day and age, everybody thinks they have celiac disease. Um, but very few people have actually gotten a biopsy. So if I ask people, have you had celiac disease, the genetic associations known, previously known to occur with that don't replicate. But if I ask you, do you have celiac and have you had a biopsy to confirm it, then I can actually hit the replication. I like get the, I can find in the genetic studies the known the known findings. So we do find that we have to triangulate questions quite a bit. Um, again, it's one of the things that I learned from Google and sort of like big data people is that it's much better to have like massive amounts of dirty data.

Speaker 4:          00:28:45       And, um, for us, you know, we have now 5 million customers, we have over 1.5 billion data points on those customers. Um, we have the potential to do a lot of research. It's without a doubt there's, it's not perfect. Not Everybody, um, um, you know, reports everything perfectly, but it's pretty good. And if I ask you for instance, like, do you have epilepsy, you can probably report that pretty accurately. And so what we find is that there's almost, um, um, you know, it's, it's almost a false truth that like, oh, a clinical trial is perfect data. It was one thing I learned when I was on Wall Street is how much when you have a multicenter trial, if you have 20 different centers trying to diagnose a partial response in cancer is really controversial. So, um, a lot of aspects of medicine like defining a phenotype is controversial and in some ways the best thing that 23 knee does is we have it all in a very standardized form and we always have the ability to go back to our customers and ask and say, okay, if you said you had asthma, now we're going to go back and ask you and ask you more about like your medications.

Speaker 4:          00:29:47       You're like, when does it occur? And you can start to weed out when something doesn't look real.

Speaker 3:          00:29:52       No, I'm sure people have seen the information and they might have overreacted or whatnot. Yeah. Um, have you considered like any connecting 23 meter like genetic counseling or providing people information on how to talk about these results with the primary care physician? Right, right.

Speaker 4:          00:30:05       We do actually connect people. Um, so we don't, the main thing that we tried to do that we feel really strongly about is that health care insurance, like a physician involvement or genomic counselor is up to you. And so we never used that as a bottleneck for access to your information. But if you find out, for instance, that you're positive for breast cancer, the Brca mutation, you know, you want to follow up with a physician or a genetic counselor. And so we have had partnerships in the past and we look at doing that more and more as where you, we might at least give you advice like, hey, here's resources where you can go to. Um, but we don't ever, we feel, again, philosophically as a company, we feel really strongly that it's never a bottleneck for access, but we do provide resources for people so they know how to follow up.

Speaker 3:          00:30:52       Um, for my friend who have convinced to try use 23 and me, some of them have told me, well, the reason why I want to do it, it's because of, I know that I could be susceptible to a heart attack or some other health problem. I'd rather like be left not knowing the situation. And then I've heard people who have said, well, now that I know I could possibly have a health issue and my stress me out or something. Have you done any research about like the psychological aspect? Yeah,

Speaker 4:          00:31:16       we have, um, we have done a lot of research and actually one of the best studies that was out there, there was a guy named Robert Green who is at Harvard and he did the original studies on Alzheimer's and looking at people as a series of studies called reveal where he was able to see that people like Alzheimer's is one of the more extreme. So people find out they're genetically high risk for Alzheimer's. Um, what do they do? And he found that initially there is anxiety. Um, but after three months you returned to baseline. And for a lot of these individuals, they already know there's a family history. So for instance, for people who have, um, again, the Alzheimer's variant, if there's a high genetic risk factor, like you probably have someone in your family network who's had Alzheimer's. So you know that you have some kind of genetic risk factor already.

Speaker 4:          00:32:00       So what we find, and for me the story of genetics, the reason why I was so interested in genetics is that you do have genes and environment. So your genetics are not, unless it's Huntington's, like it's not deterministic. It's not 100% you have this whole beautiful world of your environment. And so to me, the environment is your responsibility. Like that's what you can do. Like you can do something every single day to influence your environment. So without a doubt there's [inaudible], there's people who are genetically high risk for Alzheimer's but they don't get it. And so why, like that's one thing I'm really passionate about personally is looking at who are the people who are genetically risk for diseases, who never get them and what was it in their environment. And the reality is, I goes back to some of the original premise of the company.

Speaker 4:          00:32:46       Like one of the issues is like being really healthy doesn't make money in the system, but 23 and me is really uniquely set up in large in many ways to do research on prevention. So it's one of the things we're really passionate about is like, look at the people who have Alzheimer's and say, okay, is it interval training? Is it like extreme exercise? Like, what is it that really has an influence on your life and can we then help people take responsibility on a daily basis to try and actually help prevent diseases? Everyone knows or everyone gets sick at something like every, like it's one of the things I always say, people would say, oh you're just going to have all these healthy people. And I was like, there's no such thing as a healthy person. Everyone has something. It's like it could be depression, it could be migraines, it could be, you know, stomach problems.

Speaker 4:          00:33:28       Silly. I like anything, there's no such thing as someone who like 100% healthy. So like for me part of it was like helping people realize, um, that like your health is really a sum of your actions every day. Like, and for us to be able to do that research on like what is it in our environment that we can really do? And the thing that I take most pride in is like, rather than us creating any kind of anxiety or, or other issues is what people do is like, people are looking to, to make change. Like people get their genetic information and it's something in black and white and then they're looking to make a change. And I think the, the, the number one disservice at the healthcare industry has right now is there's not great support for changing your behavior and people don't know how.

Speaker 4:          00:34:10       So often like we heard this, um, with Alzheimer's, I had one doctor, he could stood up at a conference and complain. He goes, you know, one of the biggest problems with 23 and me is you generate non billable questions and um, and the reality is like you show up when you say I'm genetically high risk for Alzheimer's and the like will come back when you have Alzheimer's. Like that's what we do. Um, but the reality, like when you think about where do you go to prevent the number one place where people go to prevent any kind of disease in this country is realistically Walmart. Like it's a behavior, like the average American goes to Walmart three times a week or in this day and age is going to be Amazon. Like it's, it's, it's, you're shopping, it's your consumer. It's like how you are living your life every day.

Speaker 4:          00:34:51       And one of the things I really try to home in on on our customers a hammer and our customers is like your health is a sum of what you do every single day. And so again, going back to the gene and environment pitch like it is like you can control your environment, you can't control your genes but you can control your environment. And we are trying to make those discoveries about what in your environment is potentially going to influence your genes. The most people who are fearful about putting their information into the system. One thing explain hearing is how do I know that my genetic information will not fall into the wrong hands. Like recently we heard about another genetic company, I guess they were hacked or whatnot. So for someone who's fearful about sharing information to 23 and be like, what would you say to them?

Speaker 4:          00:35:31       It was one of the things early on, um, for people who are privacy. We spent a lot of time with privacy experts in the early days. And it was one of the things I conclude early on, it was like for people who are like really care, I was like, don't do it. Just don't like spend the time like get comfortable with it. Um, you know what we can do as a company. Um, cause there's a lot of irrational fears and that's why we used to say that as a company we have to do everything we can to protect privacy. Like there's fundamentally no business model. Like I'm totally dependent on my customer's participation and their trust in what to do the research and to do the types of things we want to do. So I have no business model if I can't protect the privacy of my customers.

Speaker 4:          00:36:10       Um, so we do a lot like from a database infrastructure, how we set it up, um, to even the fact that it's not a swab. It is, uh, two mils of saliva. We reject samples if we don't get enough saliva. So you can't be accidentally swapped while you're sleeping. Like it's a lot, you'll never drool that much in your sleep. Um, and so we've set up the company and also we don't have what we call it, like the legal chain of custody. So if you order five kits, I have no idea if you spat or if you gave them a way to five random people in this room. So I don't have the direct tracing back to two individuals. Um, from our terms of service as well. We've, we've, you know, specifically said it's not to be used for law enforcement. Um, and, and we've set up the company in such a way to make sure that it is really hard.

Speaker 4:          00:36:54       Like we have not gotten a subpoena on this. We've put out a transparency report. Um, we would do everything we can to fight a subpoena. Um, it hasn't happened for us, but those are the types of things where, um, for people who are really, really concerned, like just don't do it. Um, for people who like are comfortable with being on the web, um, we do everything we can to protect their privacy. Um, and one of the core elements, like one of the leading privacy experts when the things he taught me, it was like, look in what privacy people really want is they want choice and they want transparency. They want to know. So if you're a 23 and me and you don't want to share your data, like don't share it and we have, we have to respect that. So if you don't want to participate in research, you don't have to participate.

Speaker 4:          00:37:38       If you don't want to share your genetic data with me, don't share it. Um, if you want to share it with, you know, five people in this room, we allow you to share it. So we've given you a lot of controls and that's also one of the things that's relatively atypical and health care. Like if you wanted to share your medical record with me, it would be almost impossible. Um, so we do a lot to make sure that we're like empowering people to have that privacy. Um, and then have also the ability to, to compare when they want. One of the things that I just say about there is like when, when people in general talk about privacy, um, like if I picked anyone randomly in this room, like I'm sure your genetics would be really interesting and I would love to see them. Um, but your bank account is always much more interesting. And so from a desire to hack in to, you know, one or the other, your bank is just a lot more interesting. And so when I look at like everyone's Dna, um, and when I think about privacy, it's, it's significantly less on a mass area. But what you see is like within a family, people will say, I want to see if my brother was really related. Like it is he really my full brother. Um, and so you get some of those intro family privacy questions rather than necessarily a broad sweep.

Speaker 3:          00:38:51       No. On a policy level, are there things at 23, are there policies or legislation that 23 me is backing from the federal level? That's,

Speaker 4:          00:38:58       we, back in the early days, there was something called the genetic information nondiscrimination act and it passed unanimously bipartisan. Um, it is a, it's the, it prevents, it prevents insurance companies, health insurance companies and employers from using genetic information for discrimination. So that was a huge step for us. It does not, it leaves health insurance outside. Um, I'm sorry, it leaves life insurance outside. Um, but that was, that was, uh, a pretty significant step forward in terms of giving federal protection to help people feel comfortable that they can keep their genetic information to themselves,

Speaker 3:          00:39:36       ruin the life insurance aspect is or other legislation that's going to be pros in the future.

Speaker 4:          00:39:41       I haven't seen anything. Um, now, and it's interesting to me because it's been 10 years and there hasn't really been any movement or any interest necessarily from life insurance on it. Um, the reality we find too is genetic information is complicated. Like it's not well understood yet. So exactly how would you, like, we already know, like some of the biggest risk factor is obesity, smoking. Um, you know, like those are, those are the biggest out there. So other than like, okay, you're genetically high risk for a condition that we just don't fully understand yet. Um, like I'm much more optimistic about like in my dream world that we would actually have insurance. Insurance companies are embracing it and says, okay, you're genetically high risk for a blood clot and you're a woman. You potentially are higher risk than for miscarriage and pregnancy. We're going to try to like mitigate those rest by, you know, x number of measures. Like there's things I wish the healthcare system would adopt with genetic information rather than being reactive. But that hasn't really happened yet.

Speaker 3:          00:40:39       So going forward for the next 10 years of 23 and me like where, where do you see yourself as a company?

Speaker 4:          00:40:45       I think, um, one of the most interesting things I see happening finally is that there is an interesting world of virtual health care. So you know, like Vic, who used to run Google plus here, who's now at a company called alive core. Um, you know, my dad has afib and he has a little device on his phone that measures your EKG and it will tell you whether you're an atrial fibrillation. Like, that's amazing. It's totally amazing. Like you don't have to go in it. Like you can get instant real time information. We are on the beach in Hawaii and he's like, oh, I'm an a fib. Um, like it's, it's, so it's utterly amazing. And I think that there is, um, there's genuinely a world that is coming where you're going to be able to get a lot of your healthcare on your phone and is it taking a picture of your mole and then it in and you can get multiple opinions.

Speaker 4:          00:41:34       Is it someone like grand rounds where you get multiple opinions online? Like there's, there's like one of, one of the things I'm really hopeful for is that healthcare becomes less about the art of medicine and much more data driven where you get some, you know, a number of people, a number of opinions looking at a case. And, um, and you can have like, again, on the thing like a mole, you can really apply machine learning to that. And so what are ways, like I see a whole new world that is really cropping up. Um, and whether it's going to be, you know, some kind of Chat Bot that's telemedicine. Like there's a lot that's happening there. So when I think about 23 and me's role, I think that we become the hub and a large part like we are like your genetic information is the core.

Speaker 4:          00:42:18       It's like the genetic code of you. It's, it is, it's like it's the digital representation of you. And so we're the, we're the epicenter of it and then helping you figure out all the different ways that you can navigate that information and what can you do with that information. And we can't do that alone. Like that's where we need partners. Like I need ways that you could potentially analyze your blood at home instantly or that you could get, you know, you could, you know, take a picture of your mole and have it analyzed like a whole way that you can actually start to think about measuring yourself at home. Not In like, like the quantified self movement is, is more extreme, but like ways like the average individual wants to just like be healthy and proactive. So I think that there's a whole new world that is coming up, which is almost virtual healthcare.

Speaker 4:          00:43:00       And I think the brick and mortar is, um, you know, we'll always have hospitals and we'll always have brick and mortar, but, um, you know, the same way. There's blockbusters out there. So, um, there's not a lot. Um, and I think that more and more you're going to see that. Like, I don't think that you doctor's visits are going to be very different in the future. And I think that's where, um, my hope is like the research that 23 and me can do is that we will make a number of discoveries about, you know, what does, what is the meaning of a genetic information and then also what are really meaningful ways that you can prevent. And, and that's like, when I think about my ultimate success, it's, you know, I would like to have cures. I'd love to have a cure for Parkinson's and other diseases.

Speaker 4:          00:43:41       And that is a high priority and we're fucking on that. Um, but I'd also love to be able to tell a 20 year old like, this is what you need to do to be able to live, to be healthy at a hundred. And, and to me that's like, that's, that's real success. So it was kind of goes into life extension, life extension. I'm excited. It's like it's, it's again, there's a lot of silicon valley discussion of like, Oh I want to live to a 500. Um, I think it's like my goal is like very like I would just like to be healthy at a hundred. Um, like when I read stories about, you know, like a hundred year olds running the marathons and like doing things like that's what you want to do. I don't want to be like in a critical care unit, like supported at a hundred. Like, no, I want to be healthy.

Speaker 4:          00:44:24       Like I don't want to be diabetic and have congestive heart disease. Like no, like just let me be healthy. And tell me how, and again, it goes back to this like mantra of like health is what you do every single day. Like I dress like this because like I'm, I'm Googley. Um, but also because I exercise all the time, like I biked here, I'll bike back, I'll bike home. Like I'm always like, I love to humiliate people in the office when they take the elevator. I'm like, why? Like why would you do that? Why would he do it in front of me too? Um, so I think it's really important to like get some of those types of messages out.

Speaker 1:          00:44:57       Excellent. Um, so now we're going to go to audience questions. So if anyone has a question, please head over to the mic. There's a mic right there. You can just,

Speaker 2:          00:45:07       yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:45:11       when a check for online questions too. Okay. You hear me? Hi, I'm Dina on their went, when they go to the doctor within 23 and me report the doctor, typically the tell me something like, hey, why, why do you need these as I did something wrong. Now, why do you do have the d without asking a doctor first hand? So my, one of my [inaudible] is if you're doing something to educate them in that sense. And also when I see them, the possibilities to get a disease, they are all taking into account, compare it with a m people, coca sick people in Europe because most researchers, but I'm from Latin America, so I don't feel represented. I know that my, my question is if we're going to do Samson to have more samples from that region. Yeah. So like I know that my test, the results are more accuracy and also for something or Santina you, you don't have that. I mean, you can't use 20:00 PM. You have to come here. Right. So,

Speaker 4:          00:46:19       yeah. So first question on physicians and second on International. Um, so physicians are definitely the last mile. Like it's painful for us. And um, and it's disappointing to me because we get a lot of people who take their reports to physicians and the physician says, oh, this is not worthwhile. Um, so you're not alone in that. And we've tried some initiatives and the early initiatives to, to work with an educate doctors. And I always joke if I took a thousand kits to Stanford shopping center and I was like, these are free, they would be gone in five minutes. Um, if I took a thousand kits to asco, the big oncology meeting, I would come home with 990 of them. Um, like we've literally tried to give away kits to doctors and they're like, oh no. Um, so there's a huge, there's a lot of work that we have to do to engage the medical community.

Speaker 4:          00:47:06       Um, one thing that I have found is that there's like, there's a new crop of physicians, like a lot of doctors who are online and the telemedicine, and it's something that we're thinking about is how do we cultivate the physicians who are trying to embrace a world of prevention and like, what could you do with this? And it's, it's hard because like, it's not, it's not a big reimbursements. Like any way you can go to any dermatologist and get botox like today in the next hour. And if you said, I want to get a mole check, they'll be like, oh, in October I have time at nine. Um, so, and that's because a mole check doesn't reimburse, but botox botoxes you know, $300 in 15 minutes. So, um, so I think that's where like we have a lot to do to try to work with the physician world.

Speaker 4:          00:47:48       We're hiring someone. Like that's, that's like a big initiative for me on the team is how do we engage the medical world. Um, second on international, the same way we had regulatory issues here. The rest of the world is pretty complicated and there's a lot of misunderstanding about genetics. Um, so each country has laws about how to enter into those countries and they're pretty complicated. It's almost like we just haven't had, like, I think a lot of startups fail because they try to do too much, too early. So we think about international and honestly, like again, going back to the love of hacks, one of the ways I thought about just hacking it is just like, just be in like JFK in Miami and like tried it because then you can actually pull a lot of diversity in without necessarily having so or like in the reality is like the u s is this like beautiful melting pot where if I want, you know, instead of going into China, which is really complicated, like I can go to San Francisco.

Speaker 4:          00:48:44       And so like for me, part of it is making sure that we're recruiting the right populations. And so we are looking specifically at targeting different groups. Like we have a big African American initiative. Um, you know, we have a, uh, a whole global initiative of like countries where we're trying to get specific populations, um, both for the ancestry testing so that we can improve our product. But also then for having the diversity in health research. So I'm going to take it online question, who owns the Ip produced from an individual's geno typing data when they use 23 and me. So there's no IP in that capacity. So like if you, you own what happens, like if you spit, you own your data, um, if you consent for research, you're consenting to be part of this aggregate. So for instance, of I discover that um, you know, here's a gym, like I talk about 400,000 people participated in the depression study.

Speaker 4:          00:49:35       And so, um, there's not IP on, on genes, so we're not filing patents for instance, on like, Oh this genetic association is part of parking of you know, depression. So there's no IP on that. We might say, oh this, this, this mutation looks like it's potentially in a, in an area where it's potentially druggable we then make a small molecule or an antibody and we're going to target that. That is rip because like in some ways it's so far down stream from everything. Our hope is like we are publishing and putting out into the public world, like all of the genetic associations that we're finding. So we'd like to publish a lot. We have over 100 publications out there. Um, but we really look at like the longterm downstream. Like we're owning that Ip because we're putting in like, again, what's going to end up being hundreds of millions of dollars of work into trying to make successful

Speaker 5:          00:50:28       shall be curious. Right. Man, thank you so much for coming. I'm really inspired. I'm no good. I'm think Google doodles pm I wanted to ask about how you attract and retain so many women I have from everyone and I talked to in your company, they're so happy. They're, how do you do it? Especially now really, especially now that so many women are feeling like they're, they can stay in tech. Her,

Speaker 4:          00:50:48       I um, you know, we had a problem for a while where, um, we were like, we were trying really hard to hire a man for the management team and it was like, man, there were looking for a head of engineering at one point. I remember we just like, we had this woman and we're like, no, no, no, we need a man. Like we need Wiley's one. Um, so I think, um, I mean I think it's like all aspects of diverse. Like I think we've tried really hard to have a supportive environment. And for me, like I've worked, I always had, I was like, I've worked for really bad people. I worked for like some really complicated funds. Like I was like, who in the room has anyone who's been in jail? Like I have bosses who have been in jail. So like I've worked for like some really, um, challenging individuals.

Speaker 4:          00:51:35       So I know what it's like. Um, and I'm trying to do the exact opposite. Like the first job I ever had, um, the Wallenberg family in Sweden, they were amazing. Like, I've never, like, they treated me so well, so I know what it's like to have a bad job in a bad environment. I know what it's like to have a great environment. And in Sweden for instance, like this woman showed up one day and I was like, who are you? And she was like, oh, I'm newly promoted partner. I've been on maternity leave for two years. And I was like, what? Um, so it, like, it was one of those things like culturally it's set to me like, here's a group of people, the Walmart, like who promoted this woman who's like been on maternity leave for two years. It was amazing. And so I really try to create a culture where we support people through their lifecycle.

Speaker 4:          00:52:18       And um, you know, a lot of people have been at the company who they get married, they've had kids, they get divorced. Like, like there's a whole lifecycle and not everyone is awesome every day. And so like you can be awesome for a while and then you have a kid and it's like, and the kid sick for a while and you have take off time. Like, I can't be the asshole boss. It's like, oh my God, you're out. Um, like I have like, I have to support people and I look at people for the psalm of like, I hope people stay for 10 years and I look at people for the song. But like, what can you, can you contribute in that in that period? And like how do we also support you? Um, we're really very much like your family is your family, but like we're your family away from home. And so like I have to support people in a good way and I have to listen. Um, and, and I think it's like there's a level of humility. Like the number one thing we have for hiring is humility. Like you need really smart people, but like I just, the culturally like you gotta fit in with the humility and we have to support people. Paul,

Speaker 6:          00:53:21       thank you. Welcome. Hey,

Speaker 7:          00:53:26       thanks for doing this. Of course. Um, so I know there might be some liabilities associated with the idea I'm about to mention, but is there some time when this would be an opportunity finding tool as well, that your DNA seems like you would be perfect for pole vaulting? So, you know,

Speaker 4:          00:53:43       practical that we do. Um, you know, I don't know if we'll ever get down to those types of specifics. Like I think, um, um, you know, I think that there's like for sprinting, you know, there's genetic variants associated with like, do you have the double twitch? Um, will it ever refine enough to be able to say like, Oh, you know, you're really great at this specific sport. I think, again, it goes back to the world of genes and environment. Like you, you, you need passion to be great at anything you need passion. Like the, the, the most important aspect for me out of that movie Gattica was that this guy has a genetic, like he's genetically not likely to survive for some reason, but he has the passion and like passionate counts for so much. Um, so I think without a doubt you'll hear things like if you are, we did some research at one point on, um, um, and like being toned down or like having a, a musical ear and you know, you could imagine at some point like, would you say, okay, like, hey, you know, you're just not like you just, if you want to be a pianist, you're going to have to work that much harder.

Speaker 4:          00:54:51       So I think it's, you know, and we're like, we did a study for them since in weight loss. Like we, my hope one day is to be able to say, if you're overweight, you, it's only gonna take you four weeks to lose weight. You, it's going to take you seven weeks. Like you're just genetically more likely to not be able to lose that weight. And I think that's where it will help people not say, not know like, oh, you're not going to be great at this, but like you just might have to work harder instead of the famous 10,000 hours. You need 12,000 hours. Yeah. Cool. Thank you. Okay.

Speaker 8:          00:55:22       Hi. Thanks for coming. This is very interesting. Um, so I was wondering, I noticed that, I mean, so there's 23 and me, but there's also lots of other, um, lots of other sort of similar con, um, companies. So if you're looking at sort of ancestry yeah, you get to Lincoln, find out your relatives who are with 23 and me, but then there's people who are with other companies. It seems like everything's kind of siloed. Have you thought about talking to other companies and seeing if there are ways that you can connect across each other's databases to help people find relatives?

Speaker 4:          00:55:51       Yeah, I think, um, with other companies, we did a promotion for instance, on Dna day where we allow people from ancestry.com to upload their data. Um, you know, the companies are pretty competitive right now, so there hasn't been any specific initiative to like try like you can always download and I think upload. Um, so, so no, I mean I, it's, it's a problem. Like it's not in the best interest of customers for sure to not allow, like, I would think that that would actually be something that's great. But like, I think there's a lot of competition right now, so that hasn't, that hasn't happened. Um, but without a doubt, like we know that people who are looking for family members, oftentimes we'll do both services. Yeah. Okay. So, and, and again, we might do more in the future. Um, and in some ways this goes with some of the privacy issues like we had.

Speaker 4:          00:56:37       Um, so again, when you talk about the goal and say killer, like one of the things that's important for us to do from a privacy perspective is not allow a relative matches from DNA that's uploaded, right? Because if you allow that, then you open up the door for things like the golden state killer. And so we had like, for instance, when we did this promotion with, um, you know, anyone could upload their DNA from other places. We would tell you if there was someone within your close circle, but we want to identify who it is and we did that. So, and you would have to spit again. And we did that specifically so that you like, from a privacy perspective, we think a lot about privacy.

Speaker 6:          00:57:12       Cool. Thanks. Okay.

Speaker 9:          00:57:16       Oh, hi. I'm so sorry. I have some, my, a spit and then I'd get it back. And then it tells me about, um, like my ancestry and uh, well my health prospects, um, say I have like a, like what would it be like, is there a way I can prevent myself from having like cancer in the future? Like just off of that,

Speaker 4:          00:57:35       we don't have, so the, the, the cancer report we have right now is the breast cancer report that is associated with, um, typically, you know, Ashkenazi Jewish descent and um, and it does have a high penetration of cancer. So meaning like those people are likely to get cancer. What we found people have done is they go and they get either mastectomy or they take out their ovaries. Um, so there's ways that you can potentially, like it's extreme to prevent. Um, you know, the other thing that's out there is there are, for instance, there's people who are genetically high risk for colon cancer. And in that capacity, you know, right now I think the recommendations or coal colonoscopies at 45, in that case you could start having colonoscopies earlier. So a lot of it, there's not necessarily known specifics about, okay, if you want to prevent cancer, these are the things that you do. Um, in every disease area you can say, you know, don't smoke exercise and eat better. And what we find that having something that is a risk factor in black and white in your DNA motivates people to actually do all those things. But those are the biggest swing factors you have always as your exercise and your diet and your environment. Okay. Thank you. Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:58:47       Hi, my name is Yulia and I'm an intern in Google brain genomics and it looks like Google is also looking into like genetics and predicting disease from, from genetics and also connected to healthcare. Yeah, I know that also Microsoft is looking into healthcare and genetics. So what do you think about this? Like, do you think that you will collaborate with Google or Microsoft at some point or your be competitors or 23 minutes so far ahead in this research that I think so. I, I've spent a lot of time, like in, in the early days, like back when we were starting the company, like Google, Microsoft, others like Microsoft had had um, RFPs out for a while doing genetic research. They've had a great, you know, they have, they had a really great team. Um, you know, Google brain team is amazing. Um, I know Jeff Dean, well, like it's an amazing group of people that are there.

Speaker 4:          00:59:43       The number one problem in healthcare I find is nobody has the Dataset. Like I love going to big data meetings and everyone's like talking about big data and I'm like, but you don't have any data. Like, I mean, it's just, it's fascinating. I'm like, I'm like, it's like the emperor has no clothes. People like, there's not a lot of data out there. So, I mean there's some of these big initiatives and my whole goal was like I want the data like 23 and me's initial premise. I was like, you need to generate the data first. And so the number one thing that we have is we have a massive living dataset where when I can go back to my customers and say, okay, do you have migraines? Can you tell me more information? And for those customers who want to participate, they can tell me more.

Speaker 4:          01:00:25       And so it's, it's one of the things like there's the UK biobank and there's all these other biobanks out there, but they're static. Like we did this project with this one group in the UK and I requested sample, it was a recontact double database. I requested samples. Three years later they called me and they're like, we have the samples. I was like, who are you? Like what is, I was like, oh yeah, like that's their definition or be contactable like in this world of the Internet age, like just text me or like send me a message like habit, like show up as an alert on my phone. So that's the main thing, like the, the, the key that we created. I needed to first create the data before I can solve the problems. There's amazing people out there who can solve the problems, but it's really hard.

Speaker 4:          01:01:09       There's no one else out there who has the amount of data we have. We'd love to like, and they said, we, I know Jeff Dean, I know that team. While if, you know Lizzy, like all, like we love that team. We're always open to working or just join us. Like another question, last question. Okay. So, um, so I said that 23 and me's hiring machine learning specialists. So do we check, send does 23 and me use machine learning or is it mostly looking into literature and see what you, which variant is connected to each disease from literature? So we do a lot. We have a pipeline where we're doing our own genome wide association studies quite a bit. We are starting to do a fair amount of machine learning, um, and thinking about, so for instance, like one of the first applications probably is an ancestry and helping people in predicting ancestry.

Speaker 4:          01:02:03       Um, we have a number of initiatives in house and those are the types of things we thought of. But like, again, with, with all of, with all of the data that we have, we're, we're right for all those technologies now. Like, like all the applications. So again, my job is like being somebody who's not technical is like, I'm trying to create first like this massive enthusiasm from the world to participate in research and like, to learn about their genetics and then create data that has like the highest, the data quality that we need to do that research. And then to empower everybody with all the different techniques and skills like to then analyze the data and what can we do with it. Thank you. Okay. Well, Ann, thank you very much for joining us.
