Speaker 1:          00:11          All right. So, uh, so Emily, this is your first book. It is, you didn't want to start with something simpler, a brief history of time maybe. I mean, I know that's been done, but, um, but, but uh, as you write in the book, He, and this is the most complicated robot ever sent to another planet, in fact, ever sent off earth. Why did you, why did you want to write about this and, and why do you say that it's the most complicated? Oh, I think it's fair to admit that I didn't realize what I was getting into when I started writing this book. In fact, as I, as I explained in the introduction, it's not actually the book that I meant to write to begin with. It's, uh, I was approached by Springer to write a book about the curiosity mission. And I wrote, and I wrote and I wrote and I wasn't finishing and I couldn't, I wound up with a tremendous quantity of material and it wasn't able to wrap it up.

Speaker 1:          00:57          And I finally figured out that the reason I was having so much trouble it was because I'd accidentally written two books. And so this is actually just the first of a pair of books on curiosity. The second one is going to be coming out next year and will be about the science mission. So I kind of was able to partition the engineering stuff into one book and science to another book. And basically this is the book that I needed in order to be able to understand the rover well enough to be able to write about it. Science mission. And so now I'm writing about the science. I'm actually, I've got a copy on my desk and I keep on referring to it all the time. How many of this thing does it have and how long did it and when did this fail? And it's all in there.

Speaker 1:          01:34          Um, so, so, so tell us a little more about why it is the most, what, what makes it the most complicated robot we've ever sent off this planet? It's a, it's sort of the culmination of a long history of NASA is exploration of Mars. And, um, I think that the key to its complexity is that as you, um, NASA builds on from one mission to the next, you begin with a very basic, broad set of questions. What is Mars? And you map it and you find out some more things about what it is and then you ask more detailed questions. Was water ever important on Mars? And spirit and opportunity were sent with this mantra, follow the water, try to understand how mark, uh, water was active on Mars. And the past curiosities questions are more subtle than that. We know that there was water on Mars, but did they ever have a habitable environment that, um, Mike organisms might have been able to live in?

Speaker 1:          02:22          And so as the questions get subtler, the investigations that you have to do to try to answer those questions get more detailed, more complicated. Um, it's not enough just to snap pictures anymore. You have to have much more detailed kinds of data. And curiosity has these two highly sophisticated laboratory instruments that are designed to ingest solid samples and perform x Ray diffraction and ex-ray a fluorescence feet performs gas chromatograph mass spectrometry with a tuneable laser spectrometer at a quadrupole mass spectrometer. It's kind of like all of these laboratory instruments that have been miniaturized to fit inside the rover. And so just supporting that hardware requires a host of, of subsystems that are necessary to keep the thing alive. You also have to have a mission that lasts a lot longer. The warranty on spirit and opportunity is famously only 90 days. And of course opportunity is still going after 5,000 and something Saul's, do you know off the top of your head? Huh?

Speaker 2:          03:15          Uh, let me check my Mars time APP. Why it's 5,107 Saul's today, Emily.

Speaker 1:          03:21          All right, very good. So yeah, curiosity has not lasted nearly so long yet. Um, and in fact it's quite likely that curiosity will not last as many sauces as opportunity does. It's almost certain. Um, but anyway, the point is that that the opportunity was only warranted to last 90 days. It was supposed to be able to accomplish it's prime mission in that amount of time. Curiosities, warranty ran out after a first year. And so you have to build a much more robust systems. First Martian, yeah, first Martian year. Yes, that's correct. Um, uh, you have to build much more robust systems to be able to support all of that. And so that also made it more complex because you have a lot of redundancy and other things built in to make it last so long.

Speaker 2:          04:04          Famously, the one of those two labs you were talking about, the, the sample analysis at Mars or Sam Instrument, um, I think it was rich, Rick Welsh, you pointed out that that instrument alone is larger than the entire chassis of the Mars exploration rovers.

Speaker 1:          04:16          That's right. Yeah. And it's big. It's heavier than the sojourner rover was. I mean, it's the size of a microwave, which, you know, in Earth terms for laboratory instrument, it's amazingly miniature. But in terms of what a mobile rover has to support on the surface of another planet, it's enormous and has high power demands. It has exacting temperature requirements and it's just, it's a very complicated piece of machinery.

Speaker 2:          04:36          I think that might be the size of the entire first rover that we said. Yeah, sojourner, it's what Sam is the size of sojourner, bigger than the chassis of, of the Mars exploration rovers. Um, uh, so, uh, you, you did an enormous amount of research at it. It shows any, it pays off really well in this book. This, by the way, is the first technically, or I've run a lot of tech or technically oriented books in my life and this is the first technically oriented book that I've read that uses terms like stubborn gunk. I think it does a very good job of kind of like making, making these very complicated things accessible to a lay audience. Um, uh, and that's kind of an outgrowth of the work that you do. You are the senior planetary, a senior editor and planetary evangelists at the planetary society. Do you see this as kind of an outgrowth of that? Right?

Speaker 1:          05:15          Oh, absolutely. Yeah. So yeah. So, ah, I see what I do at the planetary society as kind of a translation function. There's so many exciting things happening in science and engineering and space exploration right now. Um, and uh, while I was a grad student exploring these things, I thought, you know, this stuff is really cool but nobody learns about it. And one of the main reasons that nobody learns about is that the, the ways that scientists and engineers communicate with each other are really frankly kind of horrible. Science papers are just bad. They're, they're boringly written. Um, they're difficult to understand. But when you train as a scientist or engineer, you learn that language and you become capable of reading it and understanding it. And um, you learn to use a whole new vocabulary of terms that have very specific and precise meanings. But when you use that same language to speak to a member of the public, you are basically speaking a language that's foreign to that member of the public.

Speaker 1:          06:07          So you have to translate. And it's not, one of the phrases that I hate the most in public communication is dumbing down because you are not a, you're not making things stupider. You are translating to a language that you can use to communicate with other people. And so it's perfectly possible to get across, um, complicated concepts. You just have to use the words that people can understand. So when I need to write about stubborn gunk, I write about stubborn gunk because that's exactly what we're talking about. We're talking about material that is sticking to the sides of an instrument that you can't get off even by shaking it. And that's, that's what, uh, the Phoenix lander was dealing with in the section that I wrote that about. And it, you know, you've all dealt with that problem in your own homes and lives. I'm quite sure.

Speaker 1:          06:51          And, and it's just, it's better to write about it in that way. It's more exciting. It is just as effective at communicating as saying, I dunno, high viscosity material, um, that has adsorbed onto the walls of the sample collection device or something like that. You know, you could say it that way, but why? I wonder if it, instead of dumbing down, we can say that this is a smarting down the rover, just a translation. It's a translation of, of how everything works to make it more accessible to uh, uh, to the speakers of, uh, to, uh, to people who are non native speakers of science. Right. And you're, and you're well positioned to do that having trained as a scientist yourself. That's, that's also your background. Yeah. Yes, yes. I'm a planetary geologist by training, so I as an, um, as an Undergrad I did feel geology.

Speaker 1:          07:33          I got to walk around on mountains and whack things with rock hammers and draw a pencil and colored a colored pencil maps and things. And then in Grad school I studied geology on Venus using radar images from the Magellan orbiter, which is just, it's such an underappreciated mission. It's, um, it ended in the early nineties. It mapped all of Venus in, in radar wave lengths. And Venus has a fascinating looking planet and like, I really wish now, so I would get a mission back there sometime soon. But it's hard. It's hard to study because of the insanely high temperatures and the sulfuric acid clouds and the temperature. The pressure at the surface is the same. Is that a mile beneath the ocean? So it's tough to build hardware that survives for very long on Venus. Yeah. I wouldn't want to be the guy who tries to design the rover that can rove around where temperatures will melt.

Speaker 1:          08:20          We'll land. Yes. It doesn't seem like fun. Yeah. Solder is not gonna work. Right. And the Russians succeeded in exploring the surface of Venus by essentially building a, I mean it's an exaggeration, but they were basically clockwork spacecraft. I mean, they were mechanical. Yeah. Craft. Because you can build mechanical components that can work at very high temperatures. Electronics, especially in the 1970s we're not ready to operate at those kinds of conditions. And the Russians being the Russians built these big robust spacecraft that basically worked with these mechanical systems and we're able to take measurements after on the surface for a matter of minutes to an hour or so before the spacecraft failed. And that's how we know anything about the surface of Venus.

Speaker 2:          09:02          Um, so, uh, so, so we're turning our attention to Mars. Um, one of the things I think you do really well in this book, um, uh, which, which I greatly enjoyed reading and enthusiastically recommend by the way. Um, uh, one of the things I think you really, really do well in this book is you, you, you don't just translate all of the technical jargon and terms that people can understand, but you also recognize, and this is again, part of your, your work at the planetary society. I think, um, that you can't talk about this rover just as a machine. It's not just at the rover is a machine. It's that the rover like carries with it a lot of human hopes and ambitions. And I think you've kind of communicate that as well as is what we're, we're hoping and dreaming to explore on surface of Mars.

Speaker 1:          09:42          Yeah. There's a, um, there's a book that was written actually by a sociologist by the name Jennifer TC, who has embedded with several of NASA, has a jps operations teams on space missions. And she studies the sociology of how teams work when they work on these missions. And one of the most striking things that she observed that really made me sit back and go, Huh, is the the Pronoun that um, uh, that JPL engineers and scientists use when they refer to the rover. You know, it's sometimes, uh, some people do say it, it can be traditional to call ships of exploration. She like, you know, uh, ocean going ships are often referred to as she, but that's, it's not actually very common to use that Pronoun for curiosity. The most common pronoun is we. And so think about that for a, for a minute. What it means to be referring to this machine as we, it means that we are exploring Mars.

Speaker 1:          10:36          We drilled today, we are driving across that hill. It's, it's not just one machine, it's the embodiment of all of the people participating together on this mission. And it's, it's such a team thing, especially because of the way that there were all these operational roles on the mission and many different people who can fill those operational roles on any, on any given day. So it feels more like, um, I dunno, I feel it feels kind of like, uh, um, uh, being on a, on a ship on the ocean in a way where there is a captain, but there's all these other commanders and everything else and every person has their part to contribute to make it going. And together you're on this great ship of exploration. That's what curiosity fuels like. And so it, it kind of feels like there's a false dichotomy between human and robotic exploration because this is human exploration, right?

Speaker 1:          11:27          We are seeing the surface of Mars. We're exploring places that humans could never go, or at least not now. And, uh, we're doing it through the eyes of robots. And I think that, um, you know, as, as virtual reality gets more commonplace as we decreased the separation between humans and the machines and the software that we use, we're actually going to see a merging of human and robotic exploration where we may have human exploration of the surface of Venus, except that it will be humans and an orbiting spacecraft using robotic avatar has to explore the surface. And it sound science. Fictiony but it's not, it's really not that farfetched given current technology and would be a much more efficient way for us to get human brains into surf, into rope, into environments that are really hard to, for humans to survive. Terrible radiation environment's terrible heat, a crushing pressure. Um, you know, all of those things. We just put robot bodies down there and we'd say, if we can manage to use our human brains effectively, then, then that's, I think the future of exploration.

Speaker 2:          12:28          Right. And then you haven't gone down into the gravity well, and so you don't have to get the people boosted back off the post so that you can land the humans on Phobos or something and having, you know, telling operating a mission on the surface below them.

Speaker 1:          12:39          Yeah. It turns out to be harder to do. Aereo synchronis orbits, that's Mars. Geosynchronous orbits the earth. Geosynchronous orbits because Maurice has gravity fueled is a lot lumpier and so it's hard to keep you to do station keeping with your spacecraft to keep it positioned over the one, um, at over a single spot on Mars. But there are like two stable positions. Um, in longitude or met a stable position. So you have to like really want to explore the part of Mars that's underneath those two table positions. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          13:07          So you were talking about the way that, um, that we embody the rover, right? That, that we are the rover and the, the, the language that's used. But another thing that, uh, Janet for Tessie pointed out was that, that in the same way as we embody the rover, uh, we also use our bodies to communicate about the rover. And so like for example, with spirit and opportunity, we'll talk about the solar panels. By you bend your body forward, you splay your arms backward in this position because that's what the solar panels look like. That's when you talk about the solar panels. You do that when you talk about the mobility system, you kind of move your arms in this characteristic way, right? And steer the wheels like this. Um, and, and you, when you talk about the robotic arm, you, you use your arm and it's always the left arm because their left arm. Um, uh, did you find yourself doing that when you're writing this book? Did you kind of inhabit the rover, the rover, his body that way?

Speaker 1:          13:50          I did that a little bit, but I actually find myself doing it a lot less with curiosity than I do with spirit and opportunity. Everybody else does too. Yeah. So spirit, spirit and opportunity, you have this, um, they're much more human scale and there's some metrical, it's much more easy to imagine them has having the body plan of a person or a donkey or a dog or whatever you want to imagine it. Curiosity is, um, it's, uh, you know, it's not nearly as symmetrical. It's not nearly as pretty. And, and to be honest, I really didn't like the appearance of curiosity when I first started doing the research on this book. I often feel like, you know, there's these three generations of rovers. There's, um, a store, sojourner spirit and opportunity and curiosity. And I feel like sojourner was sort of a loyal little dog that it couldn't ever go any farther out of sight of the lander because it didn't have its own communication skills.

Speaker 1:          14:38          So it just kind of poked around a rock. So you could even see these images of it, like lifting his leg on a rock because it like drives up and it kept driving and it, and there's actually an image of the rover like perched right almost sideways on a rock like this. Um, and then spirit and are much more surefooted. They're bigger, they're more human scale. So I, in my extended animal metaphor there, the boroughs that used to, or the donkeys, it used to accompany the western geologists as they explore the geology and in the American West. And then so what does that make curiosity? Well, it's the animal design by committee. It's a camel to ship of the desert. It moves slowly and steadily across the desert landscape, you know, carrying its load, lumbering load with it. And, uh, and that's what curiosity is like.

Speaker 1:          15:18          And like I said, I didn't really love it when I first saw the design, but that change actually, um, the JPL had a moment, um, had an opportunity for the media to come into the clean room and see curiosity before it got shipped to Florida for launch. And so I was actually able to put on all the, they call it a bunny suit, the white suit and the cap and everything else and go in and see curiosity, fate face to face. And I have to say that I kind of fell in love with curiosity when I had the opportunity to sit there and a, and meet it face to face. But yeah, I don't, I don't feel like I embody curiosity nearly as much because it's, it's so ungainly it's a different kind of creature from a spirit, an opportunity.

Speaker 2:          15:58          And, and that, that seems to be kind of widespread on the product to Washington facade. I talks about, about data, about how people have, have, he feels like people have emotionally connected with curiosity less than with spirit and opportunity. Um,

Speaker 1:          16:11          I think also it's a, it may partly be because of the way that the spirit and opportunity are much more, um, uh, responsive in a way. They, you come in on a morning, you plan the day and then that's it. Whereas curiosity has to be planned by committees as well, where you have, um, act as many as four parallel planning processes that are happening at the same time operating on different timescales. You do have a tactical operations team that is planning everyday of operations, but then there's a look ahead planning team that is planning a couple of days of operations. There's a longterm planning team that's looking at months and then there's a project science group that is kind of keeping track of all of the, the mission requirements and um, unlike spirit and opportunity, most of the decisions for curiosity get made many more days in advance. So it's, it's much less responsive. So it feels in a way, a lot more like some of the other big NASA missions like Cassini or these other things that need to be planned in much longer in advance.

Speaker 2:          17:11          Yeah, that's, it's, it's kind of this weird hybrid, right, where we're for that and for also for project management reasons because it has like lots of pis for the different instruments instead of one pie overseeing them all as on spirit opportunity. And so there's, there's this kind of council of, of monarchs

Speaker 1:          17:27          kind of content council of elders. Yeah. It's, it's all men by the way, which I hate really bad. So there's this group of like 12, um, pis and they're all men. There's a lot of awesome women working on this team. But yeah,

Speaker 2:          17:41          a lot of great engineers working on a team and I'm working on operations as well. Um, and in fact, that was one of the things I was going to ask you about was, um, uh, you know, you, you cite some of those women in the book. Um, some of them, the woman who designed the soft spot, for example, of the sample acquisition at handling system. Um, are you hoping that, uh, you know, as, as, as, as you are well known for your kind of science outreach or also well known as being an advocate of women in science and engineering? And Are you hoping that, you know, one of the many effects of this book will be to encourage women to go into science and engineering to see if there's a role for them?

Speaker 1:          18:10          I don't see it work. I don't think that that's, uh, something that I see coming as an outcome of this book. I think the book is, you know, designed to feed people's insatiable curiosity about what curiosity is. Right. Um, and honestly, you know, as a parent of two daughters, I don't see any problems with the number of women who want to go into science edition. Yeah, sure. It's weather science and engineering wants to keep them there. Really. Ultimately it's, these missions are really hard because they operate when you first land on Mars, the amount of time you spend, um, just continuous hours working on these missions. It's just, it's kind of nightmarish and I don't really go into that that much in this book. If you're interested in books were kind of the life of being on a mission is central. You can read, there's another recently published book by Alan Stern and David Grinspoon called chasing new horizons.

Speaker 1:          19:00          It's about the new horizons mission to Pluto. And at every stage of that mission, it was like we thought we were rolling before, but we had to get even more all in. And then I just started working 16 hours a day and getting by on three hours of sleep. And it's like the four Yorkshire men sketch right from money python. It just keeps on getting worse and worse. And You wonder how people can last like this. And people with families can't last like that for very long, you know? So you have primarily young people working on missions, um, at least on tactical operations. It's just, it's difficult now over time on a mission like this, they did what they were able to change the operational structure. So first after about, um, after 90 days they went off of Mars time. Um, so Mars time is where you set your clock to the rotational rate of Mars, which has days, 40 minutes longer than earth days.

Speaker 1:          19:48          And Scott, you're always my example of the Weirdo who loves Mars time because like if you are a person who's like a night owl with no children, you have children now of course. But if you are a night owl with no children and you love to sleep in what's not to love about sleeping in 40 minutes later every day and it sounds great, but like if you have any connection with the rest of humanity as totally miserable, if you have children who have, or a spouse or partner who has, who wants to like see you during ordinary daylight hours, it's absolutely miserable. It's also kind of dangerous. You know, I was on Mars time, um, with spirit and opportunity for a little while and because the schedule slips around the clock, you wind up, I'm sleep deprived, driving home after being up all night during morning rush hour or an empty highways and you fall asleep while driving and get into a wreck.

Speaker 1:          20:36          And Steve Squyres has actually really concerned about this and did all kinds of training for the operations team before the mission started. But anyway, after 90 days they knew this mission was a marathon, not a sprint. They quickly went off of Mars time. Um, after 180 days they stopped working on Sundays. Um, after another 90 days they stopped working on Saturdays. And what that means is that it really builds up your Friday, you have to produce a three sol plan, a three day plan on a Friday. And sometimes it means that you're not taking advantage of the full capability of the rover. But they did do, um, they do clever things like some of these instruments, like the Sam Instrument has to cook samples in an oven that is tremendously power demanding. So you might say cook them in an oven on a Saturday and just take Sunday off to let the batteries recharged because the rover would have to do that anyway.

Speaker 1:          21:23          So you might as well do it at a time when you don't want to double up on your planning. And so over time they have actually managed to get the operations requirement down to about nine hours a day. It's still a little bit long workday, they still do kind of play with a calendar a bit. So sometimes you have to come in and work at like six, 7:00 AM because that's when you need to get the commands up to the rover before 2:00 PM or whatever it is. Sometimes you have to come in late, but they still, now they allow everybody to have a good night's sleep except for the poor Kim Kam team. Kim Kam is one of the instruments and it's operated from France. So now that they're on earth time, um, the poor Kim Cam team primarily works overnight and it's kind of misery for them, but they trade off. There's only, they work into operational roles over time. Like they might have two days on ops per week and then the rest of the week they're not an option and they don't have to do that schedule. And so I find that as these missions go on, you'll find a lot of, I'm older, I'm a lot more women of people coming into operations cause the, the what the work time is much more predictable and it's much easier to balance it with all the other obligations you may have in your daily life.

Speaker 2:          22:34          So do you, you're appointed about families on Mars time. You'll remember that, uh, when uh, curiosity landed, there was an engineer, David Oh. Um, who, uh, he and his wife and their two kids all went on Mars time together. Um, because the kids didn't have to be back in school for a month or month and a half or something like that. And so they all just all went on Mars time and they were all living at the whole family was living on Mars time. What is the first of those that I've heard of? Yeah.

Speaker 1:          22:55          Yeah. And they had a blog about that doesn't work for everybody all the time. It was actually great. They talked about what can you do in Los Angeles with two children, young children at midnight at, and they found all kinds of interesting why walks they could do with lights and things like that was actually a pretty cool going to the beach at like, you know, overnight is really interesting. And so they had a good time. They saw lots of interest in wildlife and they went to various all night restaurants at the kids love. So they actually had a good time with that.

Speaker 2:          23:20          So, um, so you studied all the instruments on curiosity in excruciating detail for this book. Um, uh, in that process, did you come out with a favorite? What's your favorite instrument?

Speaker 1:          23:31          Oh, I never have favorites. Um, but she lied. But go ahead. I do have to say that, that Molly is pretty cool. Molly's are really cool instruments. So Molly stands for the Mars Hand Lens imager. It's Maa Hli. It's the camera that's on the end of the robotic arm. And, um, for reasons that I go into exhaustive detail on in the book, it turns out to be the widest angle camp color camera also that the rover has. So I can take the broadest views and because it's on the arm, you know, they can, the whole point of it is to take images of um, targets that they do. They're in situ work on with their instruments. And so they'll use Molly to take an image from about a foot away and then they'll zoom in and take one from about five centimeters away and then another one from about to one or two centimeters away.

Speaker 1:          24:15          And that gets you a nested set of images, um, at increasing resolution that helps you see what's going on in the rocks. Um, but because it's a focus, a little camera, it can also focus at infinity. So you can take long distance views and of course you can turn it back and look at the rover. And so this is, it's the first Mars rover, um, to demonstrate capability of taking a self portrait on Mars. Although notably opportunity recently took a self portrait on Mars. It too has a, um, are mounted camera. It's camera is not focused [inaudible] so the images that it took of itself, we're very blurry but it's still unmistakably the rover and it was really quite a thrill to see that. But yeah, it's become part of standard operating procedure for curiosity to take a selfie whenever it's at a drill site. And so we have these self portraits of curiosity across the surface of Mars and you can see it getting increasingly dusty.

Speaker 1:          25:09          The one that you're seeing on the screen up here is a special one where um, the, the first self portrait actually that curiosity took was just of the wheels on the surface. And you want to do that so that you can check and see how the wheels are contacting the surface check and see the condition of the wheels after the landing. Um, and they, uh, you know, after they did that, they, in order to do that they have to have the, the arm very low, obviously underneath the undercarriage of the rover. Most of the selfies are shot at an altitude that's similar to the altitude of the mass cam cameras. So that they're, it's, it's you know, taking a self portrait. But this one, they were actually at a drill site where the ground slope downward, which made life actually quite difficult for the drill team.

Speaker 1:          25:54          But because the ground was sloping downward away from the rover, they were able to turn the turret and take a full selfie from that low perspective. So that's what gives you this very low perspective on the rover. And those self portraits are cool. And the um, some people on the science team or on an engineering team were dubious. But when the, the Molly, a principal investigator and a couple of the workers on that mission a simulated what it could look like and showed it to the engineering team, they were like, oh my God, we have to do this. And so like with everything they have to do it on earth before they can do it on Mars. And so the first selfie was actually taken by the earth copy, the earth twin of curiosity. Inside. It's a little garage in the Mars Yard at JPL and you can see there's two engineers in the background.

Speaker 1:          26:40          One of them is vandever event. She's like around the corner and it's the, um, as the camera image is being taken, it's pretty cool. Yeah, I was a, I was, I am surprised that you said the Molly was your favorite because everybody, when they, when they, when you asked what their favorite instrument on the on curiosity is, everybody always has to laser cause Qpp people come on, it's a rover with a fricking laser beam on and say exactly what's not to love about that. Exactly. And actually, so it is kind of fun. There's, there's very imaginative, um, artwork. So, you know, curiosity happening, various things. My favorite one actually is one that I first saw in a cam cam team. Kim Cam is the instrument that has a laser. Um, they were doing a team presentation at a science meeting and they had a photo of curiosity shooting a laser and a full on Michael Bay explosions happening at the end of the laser.

Speaker 1:          27:28          And you're like, oh yeah. So no, it's um, I just, I like pictures. What can I say? Pictures tell a stories and I really like the Molly pictures. One thing Kim Kim has though is it does have a camera on it, um, for to take context images of where these app with their laser and later on in the mission they trained the camera to be able to focus at infinity so that you can take a long distance photos and the Cameron has this circular baffle. So it's the highest resolution camera I can take the most distant photos. So it's just like taking a spyglass and like seeing these long distance features. Oh boy. There's that, uh, you know, fairly network that we were going to visit in the future. And, and so I always kind of feel like a ship's captain every time I see those chem cam pictures just with clear, I didn't mean to disagree with you about the Mollys.

Speaker 1:          28:13          I think it's a very strong choice. And Molly also has a flashlight. Yes. Kim, my wife who works on the rovers, uh, on curiosity. That's her favorite is the flashlight. Oh yeah. There's actually two flashlights. And the reason for that is because if you're a geologist working in the field with your Rock Hammer, you smash off a piece of fresh rock to look at the crystals inside and try to identify what minerals are present you. You'll do this with the rock sample to try to catch a glance from the sun to see if there's reflective surfaces and what the angles are to each other. While curiosity can't do that. But what it can do is take his two little flashlights on Molly and go blink, blink pink, pink thing, blink to, to do lights coming from two different directions. And so that's what it does to try to, to catch a crystal glance.

Speaker 1:          28:55          I don't know that it's ever worked that way. Um, but they do use the flashlights at night because that way they have a light source of known illumination properties. And so all the night images that they've taken of all of their drill sites, they can compare the color to each other because they're all taken under exactly the same illumination conditions. So in addition to the, uh, the laser on the rover, uh, I actually learned from your book is not a thing that I realized before reading your book, but I learned from your book that Dan, the data, the dynamic Albido of neutrons experiment, um, has an eye on cannon. Yes. We've got a laser and an eye on Kennedy. All we need is a rover with a light saber and we've got the TRIFECTA. That's right. Yeah. Yeah. Uh, another, another really cool thing I learned about, uh, the science instruments for reading the book was, um, uh, about the Rad, which has a scintillating plastic detector. Yes.

Speaker 2:          29:41          Which I love that name. I had decided that scintillating plastic conductor as the name of my music cover band.

Speaker 1:          29:47          Yeah. It's not, there's all kinds of, uh, fun terms and they tend to squeeze all of these terms into acronyms. And so you talk about Sam's, tls and QMS and doing gcms and all of the samples. And, and I think it's actually a lot more fun to say Gas Chromatograph Mass Spectrometer. It sounds like, it sounds like start start trekkies you know, and let's send those, let's fire things up in our oven and send them through the, um, what does it, the manifolds, the, there are many manifolds inside Sam and you stand up with your helium carrier gas through manifold a and send it off to the tunable laser spectrometer and see what that is. It's just fun. It's fun. There's a lot of, a lot of fun terms. Uh,

Speaker 2:          30:23          um, so, uh, so again, having studied all the instruments and like this exhaustive detail as you say, um, which, which of them do you think was the most complicated instrument? Um, of all of them on the river?

Speaker 1:          30:35          Yeah, that one's easy to answer, but the first thing I want to answer is, is like when he says exhaustive detail, exhaustive is the most common adjective you use to describe my book. And I'm just glad that it's not exhausting, right? Yeah. So, yeah, so fascinating by the exhaustive, right. So, um, uh, definitely without question, the most complicated instrument as the Sam Instrument. So Sam means sample analysis at Mars. It's one of two laboratory instruments. And it's interesting that the two laboratory instruments, one of them is really very simple. And that's Kevin. It's a, that's an instrument that it has a, um, it has a laser that it shines through a little sample of powder and it, it shakes the powder so that those crystals all toss around in various different orientations. And the crystal scatter the light and you get a diffraction plot. It's the same kind of technology that I'm Rosalind Franklin used to figure out the structure of DNA.

Speaker 1:          31:28          You're doing x Ray crystallography basically. And it's, um, and that's all it is. You take a picture of the, of the diffraction and then you download that picture and you can say, oh, these minerals are present. And that's it. And that's one of the two, um, uh, laboratory instruments. But then there, Sam and Sam is ridiculous. I cannot believe they actually built this instrument and put it on a rover on Mars. It has, um, it has a carousel of more than 70 little courts cups. It can rotate this carousel under two different inlets to receive samples. Then it rotates the carousel and lifts a cup into an oven. And the oven, it can heat things up to 500 degrees. It can heat it in steps, it can heat it with a ramp, it can heat it for a little bit, then hold it or not.

Speaker 1:          32:13          It can heat it all the way. It can heat it part way. It can take it down and do it, bring it back up again. Um, and then there is a little helium tank that takes all of the gases that come off of the oven and sends them into one of numerous possible different instruments. But before that it sends them into these little chambers called manifolds. Um, which are, you know, a manifold is a place where you have lots of, um, things intersecting and by opening and closing one of dozens of different valves, they can send the material onto different getters and scrubbers, which takes certain stuff out of, out of the, um, the gases they can turn, turn on to get her for a little while and then heat the getter to release the stuff again. And then they send that into one of three different instruments.

Speaker 1:          32:54          So there's all these valves, there's all these different ways that all these knobs to turn. Um, they actually developed a, basically a programming language that they can, that the SAM team can use to send things through the Sam Instrument. One of the wackiest things I think is that the, the Pi on the Sam instrument was very proud of the fact that it's, that he can, that he programs it had basic, right. I was like, I know, I know very little about programming languages, but I know enough to know that that's not something to be proud of. It's not widely used at Google. That's, yeah, sure. So anyway, it's, um, it's incredibly complicated and to most people it's just a box that you, um, that the SAM team asks for Knobs to be turned and they turned the knobs and data comes out. And then even once you have the data, you still don't have answers because, um, the kinds of things that they're trying to figure out are so complex that the only way to be sure that you figured it out right, is to create a sample of known composition and put it through a duplicate of the instrument in a lab on earth under Martian conditions.

Speaker 1:          33:58          So that's temperature and vacuum and it's so San results, there's actually going to be a press conference tomorrow concerning a science paper that, um, is one of the main people on the press panel is Paul Mahaffey, who's the principal investigator on this instrument. And so I'm sure that the paper concerns data that was taken at least six months ago, probably years ago, because that's just how long it takes to understand the results from this instrument. Uh, fortunately there are other instruments that produced much more rapid results and make things a little more interesting for those of us following along in the mission. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          34:32          So Sam instrument has another talent. If there were a talent show on Mars curiosity, curiosities entry would be singing.

Speaker 1:          34:37          That's right. Sam famously sang happy birthday to itself using it. Sam Instrument. I actually don't know the details of what was vibrating or making noises. Was it like an FPGA or something?

Speaker 2:          34:48          Hello? I don't know the details. My wife is the instrument engineer for the Sam Instrument Insurance, so she could probably tell us about that. And again, exhausting, right

Speaker 1:          34:55          detail. Um, so, so anyway, but this story does surface once a year. Yeah. Right. Uh, but I am here to tell you it does not sing happy birthday to itself every year. That once on Mars. It was a cute little stunt and, and that's, uh, that's it.

Speaker 2:          35:09          Okay. So, um, we've been talking for about 40 minutes. Um, what's, uh, what's throwing out for audience questions as well? Um, and kind of while we're getting, oh, have you seen our microphone? This is really cool. The microphone's a little box and a soft box and they can just throw the box around the room. Um, but, uh, while we're, while we're waiting for that, let me ask you, you, you were saying the Sam Instrument is the most complicated instrument. Was it also the hardest to explain?

Speaker 1:          35:33          It was absolutely by far the hardest to explain. You'll find about 50 pages of book on the Sam Instrument night. I wore Paul Mahaffey out asking questions about, because you know, when I first started writing this, I envisioned um, you know, you, you, you, uh, have you heat stuff up, you get a gas and it goes through the machine comes out and, but that's not how it works at all. You heat, you heat it up, you get a gas, it goes into one place, then you open a valve and it goes into this place. Then you might be turning on something that pumps slightly but not too much and you get like a gradient going. It's so incredibly complicated that the, the main comment that I get from people on the mission who are not on the Sam team is thank God somebody's finally explained this to me because I have no idea how cool.

Speaker 3:          36:16          Uh, so I was wondering how does the delay between earth and Mars like affect the teams that operate the rover? Like, is it a lot easier to do work when earth and Mars are close together?

Speaker 1:          36:26          Ah, so no, actually that's a good question. So Mars and earth have a wildly differing, a distance to each other, which affects the, the communications lag. But the fact of the matter is that because the lag is many minutes, regardless of the relative distances, there's no real time commanding. So you are always doing, um, a full Saul worth of sequencing. At a minimum you send the rover receives its commands at 10:00 AM every morning, a Mars time. And so, uh, the reason that they do that is because earth is always up in Mars, has sky at 10:00 AM local time. Earth is closer to the sun than Mars is. So it's always somewhere relatively close to the sun. And so if you're doing your commanding at 10:00 AM, um, earth will always be up in the sky, although sometimes it can be a little low on the horizon. And so the rover executes, it's a one Saul's worth of commands.

Speaker 1:          37:18          And then in the afternoon, um, there are overflights by to Mars orbiters, Mars Odyssey and Mars reconnaissance orbiter. And it sends its data through a UHF, a connection up to the orbiter, which receives the data and then relays it onto earth. And so there's also overnight passes by the orbiters. And so, um, you wind up having to command in these at minimum one Saul increments. And so it really doesn't matter how close Mars is except that it is, um, uh, you can get much higher bandwidth and your transmission's between Mars and earth and Mars is closer. So you do get more data return from the orbiter, uh, because it can communicate faster. You can use a higher data rate when they're close. And so you'll see these like seasonal spikes and data rate that are not actually seasonal. They happen when Maurice has near opposition when earth and Mars are close to each other.

Speaker 1:          38:09          And then on the opposite side, when, when Mars gets into conjunction with a song, you actually have three weeks where you're not allowed to talk to the rover at all. Cause if there were a problem you couldn't be sure that your message would get through on garbled to be able to save the rover. So they all the spacecraft kind of hunker down and go into a fairly low activity mode during conjunction. I have a question. Are there pieces of the rover that it can separate from itself? Like in this selfie picture? Um, I don't see how there's something attached to it that would take the selfie. So, um, this, the question of who took the picture and how the Selfie works is one that pops up every single time I post a selfie. The issue is that the, although the, the field of view of the Molly camera is fairly wide, it's not anywhere near as wide as the kind of camera you have in your cell phone.

Speaker 1:          38:57          It's actually very narrow. So in order to take a Selfie, the rover actually takes about 70 pictures of itself in kind of a matrix sort of way. And it repositions the arm to keep the arm out of view. You know, it would never be able to photograph. It's whole arm regardless. And so you wind up mosaic King and image together, um, like this out of, out of multiple different images and they just, uh, they do it in a way so that the, the arm is not constantly poking into view from all these different directions because when, um, when you do take the Selfie, you do see, uh, you know, you will see the arm in multiple images and so you have to come up with a way of uh, neatly cutting it off. You actually see more of the arm in this picture than you see in most of the self portraits.

Speaker 1:          39:45          Usually they chop it off at the shoulder, um, because otherwise it would be crossing the front of the, um, rover. But because of all those multiple pictures, you wind up being able to get the arm out of it. And there's no real sensible way. One of the more disconcerting images that I've seen was a self portrait taken by the math camp, which is the only way that opportunity and spirit can take self portraits. As you take a, you can get a, um, a mosaic of the deck of the rover by shooting multiple images with the mass cam. And in those images, of course the master is missing because it can't photograph the mass camp. It can't photograph it's own master. And so you wind up, you get a great view of the arm, but the rovers headless and it's really kind of disturbing.

Speaker 4:          40:29          Is this the one that had to like really difficult landing? Like it was really complicated and they were really worried about it.

Speaker 1:          40:37          Well, if she goes into a lot of detail about that in a book, by the way, it's, it's really casting. Yeah. So, um, it's kind of fun. It wasn't really complicated landing. It's a Rube Goldberg he and landing. So it has, um, the problem with landing on Mars is that it has enough atmosphere to burn you up, but not enough atmosphere to slow you down. So it's easier to land on the moon. It's easier to land on earth, um, on the moon. No atmosphere. You just streak in blast with retro rockets. Boom. You're on the surface. And the problem on earth parachute and heat shield slows you down enough where you just kind of coast into a landing. That's what the space shuttle's did. That's what all the Apollo capsules did on Mars. You have to combine all of those things. So you have a heat shield that takes you from interplanetary travel speeds down to supersonic speeds.

Speaker 1:          41:21          Then you have a parachute that takes you from supersonic to subsonic. Um, then you have rockets that slow you down from subs, from subsonic to still. And then you have to touch down. And missions have accomplished this in different ways. Most Mars missions, our landers and so what the landers typically do is they get down to it as opposed to rovers. Yeah, sorry. Um, so they get pretty close to the surface and then usually they cut off their rockets right above the surface because you don't want to be blasting the surface with a lot of a rocket exhaust. And so they'll have like crushable legs. That's what Phoenix and insight have. They have legs that can take up that last bit of drop or you'll have what spirit and opportunity had, which are the airbags surrounding and it actually bounced to a halt, which I think is nutty.

Speaker 1:          42:09          I mean take a ridiculously expensive machine and whack it on the surface and multiple times. That's what spirit and opportunity in pathline. And so, um, curiosities approach, um, curiosity was already too big to have any extra lander hardware. And so it said it had a rocket assisted backpack that it lowered the rover on a rope and the rope and then gently let the, the, the rover touch the surface and there slack on the cables. And once the machine detected that there slack on the cables, it cuts the cables and flies a jet pack away, which like you can just imagine it. It's just like any Wiley, Katie, Katie character clunk. And then there's like a big explosion and a boom and stuff. We got a picture of which we actually got a picture of. It was amazing. The first curiosity image from the surface of Mars was taken by its rear has cam and you see this plume of dust on the horizon and they later figured out that that was probably the, the plume from the explosion of the jet pack when it crashed on the surface, which I think is just great.

Speaker 1:          43:07          So yeah, so it was, it's an incredibly complicated landing. But as I explained to the book, it's actually not really out of family from what had been done before. Um, hanging the rover on a rope was actually exactly what they did with spirit and opportunity. That airbag thingy was descent, was hanging on a rope off of the retro rockets. And so, um, the landing looked ridiculous, but it was very well modeled. And after they had the, uh, the two year launch delay, I have never seen engineers as confident as I saw. I mean, engineers as a rule are not confident people, they're like, well, it might work if all the conditions are right, love with him. You know, they don't want to tell you it's absolutely going to work because like as they say in the rocket business, there's a thousand ways for a lunch to go wrong.

Speaker 1:          43:51          Only one way for it to go right. And so, um, but when they were, uh, they had the last two years to really prepare and throw all kinds of um, situations at it, you know, dust storms and, and bad navigation and failure, one of the rockets and all kinds of stuff. And the machine in their simulations perform with flying colors. And in the, in the final event, it was just straight down the middle. Everything was nominal, nominal, nominal. Um, except for one little detail that maybe I'll let you guys read the book for. Yeah. So software people about while the Mike is going to the next person and software people like us, I understand the concept of, uh, Easter eggs

Speaker 2:          44:32          and little hidden things in, you know, maybe your web browser, you hit control alt shift ass and it pops up a flight simulator or something like that. Right. Um, and curiosity has one of those, uh, Easter eggs as well. And in the wheels before they, before they had not on purpose holes in them, they had on purpose holes in them.

Speaker 1:          44:48          That's right. So if you look at the, the wheels of the rover, you can see that there are deliberately a whole bunch of holes punched in them. Um, this is kind of a callback to spirit and opportunity, which they were connected to their lander with these bolts that were fired and separated after landing. And so there are holes on spirit and opportunities. We all set are there just as an artifact of the method by which they are attached to the lander, but they turned out to be really useful for the science team because you can see the little mark that the holes left in the wheel tracks to actually measure distances. Um, you can also use it to see how much the rover we will slipped during driving. So you can kind of measure distances in one way and then in a different way and see how long or short it was.

Speaker 1:          45:27          And the rover actually got to where it was using this for. Odometry could actually use its own wheel tracks to help understand how far to travel. So they wanted to include some kind of odometry marking on the wheels on curiosity to make sure that it would be easy to tell how many wheel turns there had been in the rover tracks. And so the first thing they did was that they actually machines the letters JPL into the wheels, into the treads. And so there's a picture in my book of the, of the, an early set of wheels that has JPL on it. So I left tracks JPL, JPL, JPL as it was going. And that's what I was like, you guys, you can't do that. So they came up with another plan, which was to put the letters JPL in the wheels in Morse code. So that's what you see. There's three rows there and they are, have like narrower and wider gaps. And that's the letters JPL in Morse code.

Speaker 5:          46:14          Um, so this isn't actually a curiosity question because there's something else you mentioned earlier that's been bugging me. You said the Russians landed a mostly mechanical, uh, lander on Venus and electronics wouldn't stand up to the surface temperatures. How did they communicate the information off the planet to us?

Speaker 1:          46:34          Well, um, I don't actually know enough about the, um, about how those missions worked. I mean, they did have like a pressure vessel, a temperature, um, a safe vessel on the inside that had the electronic, the limited electronics that there were, and they did do radio communications, director Earth. They didn't have orbiter, so they were doing it direct to earth. But then Venus is actually relatively close to Earth, so you don't have to have very powerful radio to get that data back. Um, I'm afraid I'm not an electronics person myself, so I don't really know the answer to that question.

Speaker 2:          47:05          Um, I, I, we're, we're kind of, we're starting to run, I'll run a little low on time. Um, uh, and it kills me that we're not going to get, get to all the questions when I ask you. Maybe we should take one more audience question and I'll ask you kind of a wrap up here. Okay.

Speaker 1:          47:17          So my question is, uh, what happens if something mechanical fails? Is there any self repair kind of capability? There is not, but there's a lot of redundancy, a lot of redundant capability. So there's a lot of planning done to figure out how the rover can still accomplish its mission even if this, that, or another component fails. Um, so like the computer systems are fully redundant. There's an a side and a B side and various components or cross strap to each other. So when a computer fails as actually happened 200 days into the mission, they can swap to the backup and operate on the backup while they repair the prime computer. And so they've done that with, um, with the main computer already. It actually took them a long time to bring the backup back online, which was kind of scary. Um, there had been mechanical problems like problems with the wheels.

Speaker 1:          48:04          And so, um, you get through that through robustness, basically any one of the wheels, the motors are powerful enough to, uh, to raise the entire rovers. Wait vertically. So like if you attached a rope to it and you could wind a rope on one of the wheels and it would, and the motor is strong enough to be able to lift the whole rover. Um, this actually became important for spirit opportunity because both of them have, have had different kinds of wheel failures. And so spirit in particular was dragging one of its wheels for a long time. Um, but the rover is still able to drive that way. It's a good thing because we made some science discoveries because of that. Yeah. And so, um, the biggest problem that curiosity has been dealing with lately is a, is a major mechanical failure and the drill, so the drill used to operate with a pair of prongs that it pressed against a rock and then there's a feed mechanism that pushed the drill into the rock while the everything else stayed still.

Speaker 1:          48:54          And the feed mechanism failed almost completely. They, it was very sticky. They couldn't get it to move backward and forward, which is critical for drilling. And so over the period of more than a year now, they've managed to get the bulky feed to extend all the way. So now the fetus permanently extended and they just a couple of weeks ago for the first time, managed to do what they call feed extended drilling where instead of using the, the feed mechanism, which no longer works there now using arm most motors. So it's like taking a drill and trying to drill into a wall like this. You know, you can imagine it's hard but, but the curiosity is arm is pretty strong. And so they just kind of lean on the arm and they pushed the drill into the rock and it worked. So, um, it's taken them a long time to fix it. But, uh, these engineers are really ingenious at solving problems.

Speaker 1:          49:40          And so, um, a lot of what you do on an extended mission and extended extended mission, which is what curiosity is on now, is figuring out how to make the most of an aging machine that does have problems but can still do great science where it is. And so, um, all of these people have a lot of experience in making, um, old groany machines work. I mean, I'd like to write a book about Galileo, about all the things they had to do to keep that thing going after radiation fried at Jupiter multiple times. And so curiosity is still got a lot of life in it. Um, they'll have problems. Um, but you know, they wished the problems weren't there, but they, they're like, okay, here's, this is our new reality and we'll keep going. That's how it works. So, uh, it's, it's killing me that I've got like 20 more questions here and we've got like three minutes. So that's not enough time. I'm thinking. Um,

Speaker 2:          50:28          but, uh, but uh, maybe we can end on this note, uh, by asking you like, um, what do you hope that readers will take away from this gorgeous, terrific book that I could not more highly recommend?

Speaker 1:          50:40          Oh Gosh. I hope that they will. Um, I guess I hope that people will take away the fact that they can understand this is a very complicated machine, but what it's doing, why it's there and how it works or not, or not inaccessible to everyone. And that's one of the great things about space exploration I think is that it's easy to explain why we're doing it. The fundamental questions we're trying to answer. Was there ever a life on Mars? Are we alone in the universe? That kind of stuff. Um, and it's, and it's fairly easy to understand how we're going about solving those problems. Were sending a robot with a drill that's like sampling rocks and we put them into a lab and, and all of these things. And you can communicate with children. You can communicate with science interested in adults as well. Um, and it's, it's just very accessible and, um, everybody can kind of participate in the adventure by following along with what they're doing. They, they share their raw images straight from ours directly on the Internet so that you can see every day, you can tune in at JPL and see what they've been doing. Um, I highly recommend midnight planets.com as a, it's a, um, an enthusiast built website that aggregates all of the images from the different rovers and puts them up in ways that are easy to see. And it's, uh, it's just, it's a fun adventure and we're all part of it, basically. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          51:55          Emily, I'm so sad that we're at a time. Um, uh, uh, but I, I, I enthusiastically recommend this book. The book is the design and engineering of curiosity, how the Mars rover performs its job. All the stuff you've heard us talk about today at a whole lot more stuff is in there. It's really terrific. I highly recommend it. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          52:10          It's also on my blog at planetary.org/blog you'll find I write updates about every two or three months on what curiosity is doing. I'll probably have a new one out in a couple of weeks,

Speaker 2:          52:19          right on. Um, I wish we had another hour to talk, but maybe you'll be able to come back and we'll be able to do it then. In the meantime, please join me in thanking our guest today. Emily Lakdawalla.
