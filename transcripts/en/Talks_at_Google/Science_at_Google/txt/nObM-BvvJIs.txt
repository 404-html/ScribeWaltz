Speaker 1:          00:10          Okay. Thanks very much for inviting me here. Um, I'll, uh, I've kind of organize my talk into different bits. So I'll go through the sections, me and my project, some history, the events from September the 14th to February 11th. Um, the event in its reception, you know, this is in the discovery of gravitational waves. The first confirmed detection of gravitational waves announced at a press conference on February the 11th, 2016 but the actual event was seen on September the 15th 2015 and a few more things at the end, which are some of which you might be quite interesting and I'll head each of the sections with this. So we'll see how we're getting along. I'll try and talk for about 30 minutes and leave plenty of time for questions and answers because they usually all various questions. So let's start with me and my project. Um, it's actually, I've been doing this for a sick kid.

Speaker 1:          01:12          He's the 45th year, not 30th year at least I started in 1972. Those were the first interviews I conducted on what was then the controversy over gravitation of waves. Talk a bit there. I took a bit more about that in a moment. And these are the, some of the books. Gravity's shadow, which is a very thick book. It's about over 800 pages long, nearly 900 pages, um, which was published in 2004. My advice is not to buy it because once you start reading it, you'll never put it down and it will waste a lot of your time. And the second that that book gravity's goal is actually two books in one. Once one book is called gravity's goes to, which was originally published separately by itself. And then the second book was called Big Dog. And I persuaded the publisher has to include gravity's ghost in the publication of big dog.

Speaker 1:          02:06          So this book is the paperback version of gravities ghost, as well as being the paperback version of big dog. There was never a hardback version of it. And what that book describes is to so-called blind injections, which is what this is when the big interfere a metric gravitational wave detectors were in business. I'll explain that in a moment and what the scientists did was get a small group, two or three people to inject into the interferometers. A signal worked, looked like a gravitational wave and keep it secret so that the whole community had to investigate this signal not knowing whether it is a real signal or a fake signal. So they were rehearsing for the detection of a real signal, not knowing whether they were already looking at a real signal to make it as valued as possible. One of the things that the book talks about a lot is whether these blind injections were really mimicking a real detection of gravitational waves because now we had the real detection of gravitational, where's the book?

Speaker 1:          03:14          This book is a real time account from the evening of September the 15th night 2015 when I was first read the email that said, interesting event has happened to you know, for about six months until the thing was out in public. And then it goes on about the reception of it in public and so forth. It's all written in real time or mostly real time. Anyway, I didn't start writing it until the event happened on a Monday and I didn't start writing the book and tell the Thursday because I assumed it wasn't a real event, just like every, all the other scientists did as well. You know, they thought there's another bit of noise. Uh, but then it grew rapidly in credibility over about two days. And then I realized, Hey, this is something interesting going on here. And I started to write on the Thursday, um, have just having collected the emails up till then.

Speaker 1:          04:19          It was obviously interesting from the word go to collect, be worth collecting emails, which I did incidentally, just so you, I'll tell you how I wrote this book. I mean, I've been at this for donkey's years as you see. And my method is mostly to initially to interview the scientists. I went in 1972 I drove across America and I'll call talking to all the scientists are involving gravitational wave detection. And then from the, uh, mid nineties to the mid two thousands, I went to every single gravitational wave conference that took place around the world and got to know the gravitational wave scientists really well. Uh, I mean, one of the very senior people and we were staying with us for the weekend just last weekend actually because we've become friends and uh, then, uh, but, and so I did an awful lot of traveling, use an awful lot of air miles, enough air miles to travel business class wherever I went for about 10 years because I had always air miles, can't do it anymore unfortunately.

Speaker 1:          05:22          Um, and uh, so I was going to maybe six, seven international meetings a year across the world. Uh, but this event I assumed was going to involve me in a hell of a lot of airplane travel, but it didn't because the whole thing happened over email. Email's a few telecoms, few telephone calls. Obviously people were talking to each other and their local groups. Remember this is a group of, uh, 1200 people scattered around the world and they did not at any time during the course of this discovery meet together in one place. They did it all by email and by telecom. And I was just sitting in the middle of this web of emails and telecoms collecting them. Um, the, the question is why on Earth, why me? You want to know if you want to know something about the detection of gravitational waves, why have you invited a sociologist?

Speaker 1:          06:15          I'm a sociologist, for heaven's sake. Okay. And this is a fairly serious question for me to, am I capable of writing about the detection of gravitational waves? And the answer is yes. Uh, and, but I'm going to justify this a little bit more than I might normally, let me say one justification is that when I write stuff, I send it to the gravitation of warf physicists and say, read this and tell me if there's anything wrong with it. And I've never had any serious problems. Well, you know, we have a few options. You know, you're saying that about us, Harry, that's not true. And I say, well I think it is true and we argue backwards and forwards and generally when I have a serious conversation like that, I'll alter maybe half of what I've, half of the points that they object to and leave.

Speaker 1:          07:02          The other half is I wear. That's the kind of way it goes. But I'm going to talk a little bit more about why it is that I am capable of writing this book because I think one of the tests I did his particular of particular interest to you guys. Uh, and there you are. There's a piece in nature. Sociologists Falls, physics judges, that's me under sociologist. And uh, I did it by playing imitation games, which of course are the forerunners of the cheering test. So I thought you might be slightly interested in these and what this nature article is reporting is something we did in 2005 strokes. Six where I got a gravitation away, physicist from my university departments in Cardiff, Cardiff is by coincidence. I shouldn't by complete coincidence, quite a big place for gravitational wave physics. So I've got one of the guys from their professor from there to ask some questions of me and to gravitation wave physicist.

Speaker 1:          08:09          And then we had three dialogues. You know me the question there, the answer from respondent, either the answer from respondent be there. This was sent to nine other gravitational wave physicists. They were technical questions and the nine other gravitational wave physicists was or asked which one's the real gravitation wave physicist. We've done a lot in Cardiff. We, me and my group has done a lot more invitation game since since then and we got to and very nice two and a quarter million European Research Council advance grant to use a mutation games as a new suit, social science method and we're just writing a book about invitation came through MIT press. Uh, and then we repeated this experiment. Those are the questions. I'm just sorry we repeated experiments. These are the for some much more recent versions of it in 2016 if you want to know what the questions were like, I've given you the 2016 questions doubles to read through all those eight questions. Just pick one or two at random so you get a sense of the nature of the questions being asked. This wasn't trivial stuff. Okay. This was quite a reasonably hard to sang professor of physics at Cardiff asked those questions.

Speaker 2:          09:25          Okay,

Speaker 1:          09:28          okay. And here's the results of that test. So, uh, on the left hand side of the table, you see that the question is we, this time we elaborated, we've got not just me but other people to answer the questions as not just me and a gravitational wave physicist. We've got three gravitation away physicists to answer the questions. We got what I call three savvy physicists to answer the questions. Now savvy physicists are astro physicist working in the same department, Cardiff Department as the gravitational wave physicists. So they knew a lot about gravitational waves from working in the same department as well as being astrophysicists themselves to savvy social scientists. And savvy social scientists are people like my junior colleagues at Cardiff who have to read everything I ever write and listen to me talking, you know, enormous length about gravitational wave physics. So they know quite a bit about it as well.

Speaker 1:          10:26          And me how Rick Collins and then on the right we got going across the top you see the people who mark to the answers, people who mark the answers where another four gravitation wave physicist for different ones entirely. Okay. The two sound the same to savvy social scientists. Um, you may, you may have already struck me, there's a problem here because the people marking their own answers, but actually it was in much of it is less of a problem than you think because the marketing was done a long time after the questions were being asked and there's 72 randomly ordered questions and it's not actually so easy to recognize which question you've answered. So it's a little bit messy but it's not too bad. Okay. To ordinary social scientists who knew nothing about gravitation away, physicist especially cause they weren't under my control and me myself.

Speaker 1:          11:18          So the first thing to look down is the left hand column and you'll see the way the, for gravitational wave physicists, you could get a maximum of 32 points. Then if you answered every question right. And I got the grant other than the three other gravitational wave because it has got an average of 27 points and I got 25 points, which isn't bad. Whereas the non gravitational wave physicists, crucially including the savvy physicists who didn't know anything about gravitational waves, got considerably less points. And there's an interesting lesson in this very little small experiment, which is the, is that like crevasses? They're very narrow and deep and it's not the case that if you're a scientist and a white coat, you can go up and pronounce or authoritatively on any similar subject as close to yours. And this little tiny experiment shows it and even a snotty nose sociologist like me can do better in answering those questions.

Speaker 1:          12:17          Then a physicist who's been spent a lot of time near to other gravitational wave physicist, well, there's more in that table. We can come back to it in the question session if you want, but I don't want to spend a whole lecture on that. So some history of this, the first person to have tried to detect gravitational waves, Einstein invented or worked out that these were a consequence of the theory of relativity in the early 20th century. He worked out what the, kind of, not the wave form, but some of their properties when he worked out the general theory of relativity in 1915, uh, the detection, which was in 2015, was miraculously just a hundred years after Einstein had come up with a detailed idea, uh, but the first person to try and detect them with Joe Weber, this guy here shown here who started to try and detect them in the, in the early sixties with a device like this, that thing he's working on is a cylinder of Allah minium wiring, a ton and a hall for a couple of tons suspended, insulated in a vacuum tube.

Speaker 1:          13:25          It has PSE electric crystals glue to its surface, which will sense any slight vibration in the, uh, in the cylinder. And the trick is to have two of these cylinders, a couple of thousand miles apart and look for coincident excitations in the two cylinders. And what you say as if this happens, if the, if, if you've eliminated all sources of vibration and the cylinders you call them, they were always juggling a bell from Brownian motion and residual vibrations coming up through the earth. You hadn't quite managed to damp out and residual 60 mains frequency and things like that. It's coming through the electrical system. But if you can eliminate most of that stuff and then you see couple of big excursions happening at exactly the same time or to be more exact within the light travel time between the two, 2000 miles on our detectors. Okay. You can, you say, well I, I can't think what could have caused this.

Speaker 1:          14:29          So we'll call that gravitation waves. Okay. Well you, you can think of some things that could have caused it. If you get a lightening strike somewhere in between the two detectors, well they could cause it. And the other thing that, the sort of thing that people used to worry about is what if this happens on Monday night in America when everybody's watching Monday night football and at the interval low got up and switch a kettle kettles on that's going to send a pulse through the grid at exactly the same time and that could fall. You might think that's a gravity wave, but so you wipe out all that sort of stuff and you try and measure all that sort of stuff and you try and get to a gravitational wave. Um, that's a schematic of Joe's Webber's designed, um, uh, another half dozen people tried to repeat Joe Webb as findings pretty well completely.

Speaker 1:          15:20          They didn't confirm it. And that's when I come in in 1972 going around interviewing both lots of scientists and trying to work out how they argue with each other and how they come to a conclusion. That was my earliest work. Um, and uh, yeah, let's, let's see that, so with that technology, which was improved, the next generation of these resonant bars was cooled down to near absolute zero. Uh, they're quite difficult, but let's, it says Joe weapons operators must've cost a few tens of thousands of dollars, and then you're getting into the hundreds of thousands of dollars with a cryogenically cooled bars, a big sentence of this virtually, uh, as well as the United States. And over the period up to the early two thousands, about half a thousand claims were made to have detected gravitational waves with this technology, but they were all shut down eventually by the scientific community. That's an important piece of context to the discovery when it did happen, because you've got to realize that when these people were thinking they were seeing a gravitational wave in 2015 this was against a background of nearly 50 years of shooting down every single claim that had ever been made to have seen a gravitational wave.

Speaker 1:          16:37          And there was a lot of paranoia about and a lot of enmity about, because the rest of the physics community generally felt that their money was being wasted by these idiots trying to detect gravitational waves. I should add that the should have said this before, the point about gravitational waves, they're very, very, very difficult to detect. So how are they produced? They're produced by moving masses. So just as electromagnetic waves are produced by moving electrons. My fist here is producing gravitational ways cause I'm moving in about how much, well, probably about a quantum of energy in the lifetime of a couple of universities. Uh, when Einstein worked out, the formula for the emission of gravitational waves, uh, in the denominator was a factor of the speed of light. The power for that just gives you a sense of how, uh, difficult to detect these things are.

Speaker 1:          17:39          We'll come back to that in a minute. Um, so half a dozen claims were made and the, and the point is that if Joe Weber had been right and he'd really been, didn't detecting gravitational waves according to the theory, either something very funny would've been, must've been going on. Like there was a very local source, which we couldn't see. I mean really local predicting, emitting the ways he was doing, he was seeing, but most people thought the way it ought to be coming from the center of the galaxy if he was seeing them. Um, or either that or there's so much energy, Jen energy was being produced in gravitational radiation that the milky way should have been burning up before our eyes and disappearing. Uh, and people were upset by that idea and so they didn't really want to accept code Joe Webb as findings nor any of the subsequent findings.

Speaker 1:          18:31          So that's the early technology. Then the technology slowly and gradually moved over to interferometry. Um, an interferometer who doesn't know what an interferometer his hands up, okay? An interferometer is a device with two arms. There you can see the two arms, okay? You go from a center station, you shine light down the two arms. The light is reflected back for mirrors at the end. And then the reflected light is combined on a screen in the, in the middle. And if you see that, if that light is coherent, you will see, um, a pattern of light and dark. So called fringes, light and dark stripes on the screen. Okay. And the light and dark stripes are caused by the interference of the two beams of light coming back and meeting each other. They're dark where trough and a peak coincide and cancel each other out. They're bright where two peaks or two troughs coincide and double the effect. So you get these light and dark troughs. Now supposing you my new increased the length of one of the arms, then

Speaker 2:          19:48          okay,

Speaker 1:          19:48          the position where the light light that said the to the light and dark troughs we'll meet each other will be slightly different. So what you'll see is that that pattern of fringes move slightly across the screen. And this is an incredibly sensitive instrument. Now I've built one of it. I bet a lot of these actually myself just to homemade one and you can do it. And I'm going to write another book about gravitation and ways in which I'll give you instructions on how to do it. Uh, but it's very, it's pretty easy. Um, mine has arms about my typical one has arms about eight inches long. The source of light is a laser pointer. Okay. Uh, the mirrors are just bits of broken shaving, mirror. Don't need anything fancy. You need here a beam splitter,

Speaker 1:          20:35          which should be something like a semi silvered mirror. But I've discovered any old bit of glass. We'll do, I just use a bit of glass out of the picture frame for my care. And you can produce interference fringes, not nice, neat lined up ones, pretty rough ones. But nevertheless you can see they are interference, fringes, light and dark, light, dark pattern. And you can test this out. So this, this little interfere type of interferometry liabilities made out of a bit of chip board as a base. And if you've got a cup of coffee and put it down on the, on the base somewhere near one of where one of the beams is, the wood will expand and you will see the expansion of that word as a movement of the light and dark patches. And when you take the coffee back, pick your coffee, cup up, that expansion will slowly go back again and you can, then you can put your Coffee Cup on near the other beam and you will see the movement of the fringes and in the other direction and back again and so forth.

Speaker 1:          21:31          So it's quite a nice fun instrument build. Uh, I just did that for myself to help myself be more of a participant in the whole gravitational worth business though I once took it to her, a physicist, a gravitational wave physicist conference and said, what do you want to display this? And they sneered at me because of course they're interferometer is a somewhat more sensitive. The interferometer is used in the detection instrument are the arms or four kilometers long. Okay. The lasers are extraordinarily powerful and the light doesn't just bounced for kilometers and come back. It bounces backwards and forwards. It's a hundred times before they recombine it and so on and so on and so on and so on. And so on. These things are, um, probably, I think, no, I don't say probably they are the largest law, the most sensitive large scale instruments that have ever been built.

Speaker 1:          22:28          It may be the most sensitive instruments that have been built, but they're certainly the most sensitive large scale instruments that have ever been built. So that kind of the interferometry took over from about the early two thousands or late 1990s and there was a big war between the people champing the interferometer technology, which cost hundreds of millions of dollars and the people championing the resonant bar technology, which costs $100,000. There's a big war between them. And one of the things I document in my earlier books is how this war played out and how they want them, what happened. But you know, by now the resonant bars are almost forgotten. Um, those are the two big interferometers in America, one in Hanford, in Washington state, one in Livingston, Louisiana. And there you can see the four kilometer arms stretching into the distance and the center station. And it was these instruments that made the discovery.

Speaker 1:          23:29          Uh, uh, there are two generations of these instruments. Initial logo was built to about s when it was taken down about five or six years ago and they used the same housings to putting bigger mirrors, more powerful lasers, various other things like this better suspension itself so that it would work still better. And that was ready for business in the autumn of 2015 to February 11th, February 11th was the press conference, uh, which you may have seen. It was all over all the news bulletins when that gravity waves have been discovered. I was up here in London because they had a little press conference in London. I went to that and uh, down in the basement of the building, we went after it. We went for a drink and I was doing high fives or as a physicist, RSP announcement came up on the BBC news at six o'clock. Um, this is the very first email. I keep writing. September the 14th. I'm sorry about that. Um, that's the phrase high old CWB.

Speaker 1:          24:36          Oh, I was just put on grace DB, a very interesting event in the last hour. Okay. Um, if you want to find out what all that, all those technical terms mean, you'll have to read the book. It's all explained in some detail, but that was it. Um, but it didn't excite me particularly. I just thought, oh, I better save. I say I've been, I'm always getting 'em for years been getting dozens of emails a day from the gravitational wave community. Every now and I'm going to think, oh, that might be interesting. I'll put them in a separate folder. But mostly I just delete them after reading the subject line. But this one I thought, well, I'll start putting them in pop, sort of putting these in their own folder and see how it fades out. Uh, and you know, a couple of months later I just reaffirmed that I was not the only person thinking like that. So you can read that quote from a gravitational wave physicist.

Speaker 1:          25:41          No, he says, could it have appeared so earlier the run, it's because the, the machines weren't officially switched on. They weren't supposed to be officially switched on for another few days. This was what we've got and what was going on with an engineering run and they were still being shaken down. Uh, as it happens, that was an extraordinary lucky thing. On the one hand, people are data. This shouldn't happen in engineering run and all. We are in a position to make any claim with this, given that it's in an engineering run, uh, there'll be too much noise. Machine won't be steady enough, people who have been messing about with it. But it turned out people hadn't been messing about with it just around the time and there was just enough sort of period of smooth noise for them to be able to do this. Two, for that to be enough of that period for them to be able to do the calculations, the statistical calculations they needed to do.

Speaker 1:          26:38          So that's the so early in the run. But the great advantage of it being so early in the is that it made it very unlikely that this was a blind injection because that's what all the physicists burger by this time fed up with. They'd already spent a lot of their lives analyzing and investigating blind injections and they didn't want to have to investigate another blind injection and they thought, oh no, this is the management shoving it in another blind injection to test us again. And nobody knows what to do because if you're seriously investigating gravitational waves, your life changes. You know, you, you stopped talking to your partner and family on seeing your kids. You're working like hell to analyze the data. And it's even worse for me because I had written two books about blind injections, which was a good thing. Thought that was fine.

Speaker 1:          27:32          I was happy about it, but there was nowhere I was going to write a third about a blind injection. And that meant if it had been a blonde injection, I would have been wasting another three months of my life. Now, I spoke to the director of the project and said, look, this is going to happen. If you put it in another blind injection, you better tell me because I can't spend another, I'm too old to spend another three minutes of my life messing about with a blind injection. And he kind of, I think we had an understanding that he would. Okay. Um, and then we worked out how am I going to keep it, the fact that I know secret from everybody else and I'll pretend I'm very also, I can't get on the planes to fly to meetings, which I thought would be necessary at that time.

Speaker 1:          28:13          Turned out not to be. And we said we sorta had a nod and a wink about that. Uh, but because it happened in this engineering run, most people were ready to believe that directorate when they sent around an email saying, no, this is not a blind injection. I mean, there's a lot of paranoia. There were people who still didn't believe him. I thought that Boston is, they're trying to test us even more, you know. But eventually people decided was nothing we could do about this. We've got to get on with the analysis. And I decided if this turns out to be a planned injection, that's the last I'm going to have to do with lugger. Okay. But it wasn't a blind injection. And, and I was reassured by the fact five minutes, I'm going to take a bit longer than my promised half hour. Okay. Is that all right?

Speaker 1:          29:01          So, uh, uh, I, uh, it was okay. Then the other thing that people starting to do, so you've got this signal, do you believe it or not? Well, I will tell you that remarkably, and this was completely astonishing given the paranoia that was around that it only took about two days before people began to believe this is a real signal. Once they dismissed the idea of, you know, the hadn't yet dismiss the idea of blind injection. And the other thing that everybody was worried about it, was it a malicious hack, was it some clever, malicious people from Google who got into the system and something which appeared to be a gravitational wave into the big machines. And one of the big efforts was to work out well, what would it take to do? Is it credible that somebody could have hacked into it and done this?

Speaker 1:          29:55          And the conclusion was, no, it wasn't. It would have required to bigger conspiracy and it couldn't be done. And people were reasonably satisfied with that notion though the idea of a malicious hack or hackers still around among the fringe scientists who don't believe this. Um, so that was another thing that was sent a lot, spent a lot of time and was then the analysis starts, you know, the belief that belief in two days came because the signal produced a very nice way for which very nicely matched to signal from an inspiring binary pair of black holes. And the way form overlapped very nicely on the two detectors to one at Hanford and the one that Livingston a couple of sales and miles apart. And that got people to believe it. But that's not good enough for the physics community. For the physical community. You have to show that the unlikelihood of this being due to chance is about one in three and a half million.

Speaker 1:          30:55          That's the five sigma standard. There's a whole sociological story about how that sigma, how that standard changed in physics from three sigma and about in the 1960s up to five sigma in the earth in Ne two thousands, which is also discussed in the book. So, uh, that's the signal. That's the figure from the first publication. That's a sort of slightly simpler and more easy to understand version of it, which I got one of the physicists to draw for me. Uh, and you can see how you've got to do a few things. So, um, that's what the signal from one of these overlapping, sorry, inspiring binary neutron stars ought to look like. Okay. This is more like what it would look like on the machine. You've got to take into account the sensitivity of the machine and various different frequencies and these are the actual signals from the machine and they overlap very nicely as you can see here. Okay. And if you take those that overlapping signal out, this is what you got left and it looks like noise there in lies a story. Does anybody know I'm doing a piece of sociological fieldwork now?

Speaker 1:          32:15          Has anybody heard of any recent objections to the validity of this finding by Lego? Yeah. Anybody else? That's one person you've heard of it? Yeah. Okay. Yeah. [inaudible] I really want to know this. Really put your hands up high because I want to count one, two, three, four, five, okay. People in a room of a hundred. Yeah. Something like that. Uh, and what they found out, the people who are making the recent objection is they've analyzed this and they found out that there is an overlapping signal here.

Speaker 2:          32:57          Okay.

Speaker 1:          32:58          And there is leftover because when the subtraction was made of this from this, it wasn't done quite right. And so there is in fact a bit of overlapping signal here. But for some reason please objectors have decided that the fact that there's an overlapping signal there means that the original detection can't be trusted. Um, nobody in Lygo thinks this is just in any way or not a reasonable objection. And for what my opinion is worth, I don't think it is either. But it's interesting sociologically. Um, and bears very nicely on the difference between what you know, when you're inside a team and what, you know, when you're outside of team cause the objectors or outside the team, you know, they, they, as most people think, I don't know how to analyze their signal properly. And that goes back to my little experiment on narrow crow, vast like nature of science.

Speaker 1:          33:58          Um, just, uh, the difference between, uh, how you come to believe in a signal, which was the overlapping way forms and what you have to do to prove it to the wider scientific community. You could read that quotation from one of the gravitation away physicists. They did a little jiggery pokery with the statistics. It was, everybody was agonizing. It wasn't legitimate. It was this statistical massage concluded. It wasn't statistical matter. I was, what they did was okay. Uh, and I believe it was okay as well. But you, you see how there, that's a nice thought about it. Um, from one of my colleagues in the gravitational wave, physicists physics, and you see how people are worried about it and you see the reason I put up a quote, do you want to see the difference between what makes people believe in something and what makes people think about what they have to do to convince the wider scientific community the event in its reception?

Speaker 1:          34:56          That's what what was said at the press conference. We have detected gravitational waves. We did it. Uh, what you, nobody knew at the time and what I was stream me sort of cross a bell was that the reason, one of the reasons anyway, that peep the announcement was made with such a huge confidence is cause by that time they had already seen a second gravitation wave, which hit on boxing day 2015 December the 26th, but they decided as they hadn't finished fully analyzing it, they weren't going to mention it. The discovery paper, I thought this was deceitful and it was falsifying history because the real, there have been cases in physics before where a single event, it turned out to be wrong. The most famous one is a magnetic monopole. And the physicists through, during the course of this whole event, people were saying, oh, let's hope this isn't another magnetic monopole. And then on December the 26th, the boxing day after a bit little bit of analysis been done, a great sort of sigh of relief. Thank heaven we found a second one, but that wasn't mentioned in their discovery announcement, which would seem to me to be completely wrong.

Speaker 2:          36:08          Okay.

Speaker 1:          36:09          Uh, talk to the paper that was the title of the paper observation of gravitational waves from binary black hole merger. And it really did when I was not in sociological mode, but getting scientific mode, sen cold shivers down my spine to imagine this would happen after I'd been hanging about for 44 years. This is the event, billion and a half years ago, a vision and a half light years away, two black holes of masses, 36 and 29 solar masses collided losing three sons with of mass, which was totally converted into gravitational wave energy. Compare that three solar sons with a mass with about a gram, a converted into energy for the first atomic bomb, five pounds for the biggest hydrogen bomb that's ever been made.

Speaker 1:          36:56          If the energy had been admitted as an electromagnetic radiation, it would have been brighter than the full moon, even though it was a bridges and the half light years away brought in the full moon for just a fraction of a second. And if it had happened that where our son was, it would have evaporated the solar system in an instant. But as it was, the energy was emitted as gravitational waves. Remember I said how faint it is, faint gravitational radiation is if you'd been at a distance of our son from this huge a mission of energy, all you would have noticed would have been a slight

Speaker 2:          37:32          okay

Speaker 1:          37:33          bang in your ears as your bones in your ears, but moved slightly by the gravitational wave passing by. You wouldn't notice otherwise. Uh, the effect on the four kilometer interferometer arms changes in the length of one arm as compared to the other down to one 10000th of the diameter of a proton

Speaker 1:          37:56          small, which I worked out and I live in Cardiff, uh, that's Cardiff Bay taken from what was then my study Cardiff Bay. It's about a square mile of water. What you were looking for as a rise in the level of Cardiff Bay, which would have been caused by the addition of one 1000th of a drop of water. And that's why I said it's the most sensitive instrument and it's probably ever been built. Here's the press conferences is the newspaper headlines. There's a song to the tune of, I'm a believer by some of the physicist. Uh, there's a huge spike in Google, okay. Which shows that the whole population has suddenly become fascinated by gravitational waves but not as fascinated as they are. And Kim Kardashian checked down the same time. It's about 2% of Kim Kardashians peak and it completely invisible by Kim Kardashian's average popularity. Okay. A few more things. Uh, how do we know it's true nowadays? Well, we don't, but the way

Speaker 1:          39:13          discoveries in physics or social changes and one of the reasons the social changes come about is because you, you know, when to stop questioning, there's all kinds of doubts you can still think up. Okay. The whole thing depends on trust and reasonable level of questioning. On the day of the press announcements, this was announced in cern and I listened to the recording of the announcement in cern and uh, somebody said, how do we know that the gravity waves travel at the speed of light? Because we don't travel at the speed of light. All bets are off. How do we know they travel at the speed of light? The whole observation is consistent with them traveling at the speed of light. But we don't, we've never had any real proof. And somebody put up their hand for the audiences that, look, if you carry on questioning like this, we'll soon have uninvented the Higgs Boson. Okay. And that's right. That's the reason you stopped questioning because if you question deeply enough, everything collapses and discovered the Higgs. Um, then there's, there's a whole lot of stuff here with the fringe who are criticizing it. They didn't the fringe don't believe it. I was in touch with fringe scientists and corresponding with them. Um, and the reason was, well, I'd better stop actually. I, well I just don't have time for questions. We can always come back to these slides if you want, but I'll stop there.

Speaker 3:          40:45          We do have time for questions. Please wait for the microphone. Why did you pick gravitational waves community to study?

Speaker 1:          40:56          Pure coincidence? Um, I was doing my phd. I'd already done a study of scientific communication among people building a new kind of laser transversely, excited atmospheric pressure, CO2 laser. I wanted a more competitive field to compare it with. I read about the controversy in the New Scientist and I thought that'll do me. I pick one or two others as well

Speaker 3:          41:20          and all that. Is it a community of sociologists doing quivering book is, or is it someone embedded in the Higgs Boson community?

Speaker 1:          41:26          Well, there are sociologists going around studying, uh, other bits of science. I'm trying to encourage of this kind of work to be done because I think it's very important that people outside of the technical scientific community have a really deep understanding of science.

Speaker 2:          41:49          Yeah.

Speaker 4:          41:50          How much does this ups, the retreat cost and when you take the whole scientific budget and budget allocated for the same difficulties as fundamental assert how much, how it is I am located for this particular device.

Speaker 1:          42:04          Okay. Well the whole lot you can say nowadays by now it's cost about a billion dollars. Um, I don't know how that compares with the scientific budget as a whole. One of the problems for the interferometer was being so expensive that I should have said they were funded by the national US National Science Foundation and it was the biggest experiment in the National Science Foundation. Had ever funded. Uh, now, um, high energy physics is mostly funded by the Department of Energy and they have a lot more money. So the trouble with gravity waves is it had an impact on the many scientists doing much smaller experiments which were funded by the NSF. So it became very unpopular among a large constituency. Um, but uh, when people ask me how much it costs, I always say, well, it's probably about the same as the wing of a stealth fighter. Compare it with, with military budgets to put it in perspective. I see.

Speaker 4:          43:07          There must be the similar ones built all around the world also. Right. I heard in India is they are building one there. Yeah. It didn't make sense to spend that much money there. Yeah. The Indian, yeah.

Speaker 1:          43:19          One is, is um, the Indian in India there now, and it's been a long negotiation over this, they're building the infrastructure for it, the beam tubes and the foundations and the buildings in India. But the interferometer parts are coming from America because when initial logo was built, they built three interferometer within the beam tubes for two, and they're taking the third one and that's going to India. Why does it make sense? Well, what does the whole thing makes sense? Um, it makes sense because he's a fantastic confirmation of Einstein's general theory of relativity. But it also makes sense if you like astronomy, because what where it goes is the foundation of a new gravitational wave astronomy, which enables you to see things that you can't see with electromagnetic astronomy. So you can pretty well looked directly at black holes, which can't be seen any other way.

Speaker 1:          44:16          So this phenomenon that was discovered this in spiraling of two black holes, nobody knew if such things existed. So there were two discoveries, the first discovery of gravitational waves and the first discovery of inspiring binary black holes. Why do we need another one in? Well, what the ideal is is to move this astronomy along so that you can see a gravitational wave and compare its position in the sky. Look at this position in the sky with electromagnetic telescopes. And for that reason, you've got to know its position in the sky. And the only way to know its position in the sky is pro by triangulation of the time of arrival of the event on widely separated instruments at the moment, with only two instruments, you get huge area on the sky where it could've come from. There's a third one actually in Italy, which is just coming online. And then with indium on, there'll be four fairly widely separated and you may be able to narrow down the position in the sky more narrowly then, and then your gravitational story will get better and better.

Speaker 2:          45:22          Yeah.

Speaker 3:          45:23          Um, with hindsight, we can suddenly tells it, uh, the first 40 years of, uh, informative, uh, we're clearly not sensitive enough.

Speaker 1:          45:37          Well, if not 40 years of interferometry is 14 years, 14 years

Speaker 3:          45:40          detectors. Yeah. Um, was there any acknowledgement of the time that this might be?

Speaker 1:          45:45          Um, yeah, I mean, Joe Weber I interviewed in 72 told me that when he built this apparatus, he didn't expect to see anything because everybody knew it was not sensitive enough. By factor of a, you know, a thousand million. Uh, and, uh,

Speaker 1:          46:06          the question is what do you do when you make you appear to make a discovery, which ought to be impossible, do say, oh, forget about it. It's theoretically impossible or you say, well, maybe we need to think, rethink our theories through. And a lot of people did start rethinking their theories and find ways to make Joe Weber's findings compatible with theory, like focusing of gravitational waves by some curious mechanism. So there's a dilemma there. And that dilemma was played out and among the people who put experiment first and the people who put theory first. So everybody knew that in theory, at least in the initial theory, these instruments were far too insensitive to see anything. But the determined experimentalists still felt well, if I've seen something, I'm going to report it.

Speaker 2:          47:00          Okay.

Speaker 3:          47:01          Do you see any, um, sociological parallels between the whole field of gravitational waves and people were kind of on coming on both sides of it to climate science?

Speaker 1:          47:12          Oh, yes. Um, the, uh, as I said, I did my first lot of interviews in 1972 and then another lot of interviews in 75, uh, 7,272 in 1974 I wrote the paper that emerged out of the 1972 fieldwork and the big claim in that paper, the reason I got a university secure university job and had a stellar career subsequently was the observation I made it. There was something called the experimenters regress and experimenters, regressed goes like this. Uh, scientists say, well, if you want to know whether something's true or not, you have to replicate it. And I think that's correct. But the trouble is how do you know whether you've replicated something or not? So the people who copied Joe Weber's experiment or roughly copied it said, look, we've built an operator's like yours, Joe, and we don't see anything. And Joe Weber said to them, that's because you haven't built it.

Speaker 1:          48:12          Right. And that's not an unreasonable claim because doing an experiment is very, very, very, very difficult thing about day experiments you did at school. They never worked mostly. Okay. You have to be told by the school teacher that they weren't working and you had to keep on repeating them until you got them to work. And this is what Joe Weber said the other people needed to be doing. Yeah. So what happens is if you look at what happened in 72 and for few years afterwards, the argument turned from has this been repeated to who's competent to repeat it? Who's the most competent experiment or is it Joe Weber or is it his rivals? And then when you get this idea, you see it happens all the time. Cold fusion, climate change. Yes, you can put this template onto climate change and it works very well. I mean, the next problem you have having done all that is to say, well how do we come down on the right side of climate change? And I'd had been voted in huge rowel since the early two thousands with my colleagues because we put forward a view that we have to shift our attention in social studies of science from how do you reach the truth to how do you decide who's an expert? And you should always listen to the experts whether they're right or wrong because otherwise your society is going to collapse and you're going to have a dystopia. And fortunately my friend Donald Trump has come along to help my views get sober.

Speaker 5:          49:55          Thanks very much for your talk. And I was just curious, you mentioned before about how black holes can't be observed, you know, any other way except for gravitational waves. So how did they know when they observed these gravitational waves that they were two black holes rotating? Is it because, um, they had a theoretical model of what the garden, the station Louise would look like in this kind of matched it? Or was there some other way that they knew these black holes were there?

Speaker 1:          50:18          Uh, no. Uh, it's a good question. Um, so two things. Yeah. Firstly, you've got this model which took years and years and decades to work out, which didn't match it. But then at the time people were saying, but maybe they're not black holes. Maybe their bows on stars. Bose OnStar's. Why about the same as black holes? Okay. Uh, and but who's ever seen a Bose onstar we've seen even less than black hole. This is just a figment of theoretical physicists imagination. You can imagine anything and I'm tearing out my hair saying, oh no, not those on stars. We know bows on styles for haven't sake. Let's have a discovery at last. I want to die. Having reported to discovery and the bows on star sorta thing faded away, but it's one of those things you could still ask. You could still ask, has it really been black hose?

Speaker 1:          51:10          And people could still argue now expose on stars. It's one of those places where you say time to stop questioning guys. Okay. Then there was another nice little argument produced for why they had to be black holes. They could tell how far apart these things where just before they collided from the speed of rotation and they knew how much they weighed also from that kind of thing. And you could work out that nothing that wasn't very compact could get that close without touching. And that was another argument for being black holes. So it's a good question because the argument is still not completely settled but it's settled if you're a physicist and you want to be called kind of reasonably sign.

Speaker 2:          51:58          Okay.

Speaker 4:          51:58          Um, have you now finished with the gravitational waves community or what are you going to do your next? I don't think anything else is still going on that you're studying.

Speaker 1:          52:05          That's a very good question. Again, because I thought I'd finished. I decided that this was the time to finish. Nothing is exciting. This is ever going to happen to me in my life. Studying again, my life studying physicist and I've kind of corralled somebody else to carry on after me looking at a gravitational wave physics and continuing to write the detailed history of it cause I don't want it to stop suddenly. But this business about these guys objecting to it is really interesting from a sociological point of view. So I've found myself getting sucked into it again and I'll probably write a bit more about it before I do completely finish.

Speaker 2:          52:46          Okay.

Speaker 4:          52:47          We are unfortunately out of time. We have one time for one more question. Oh, hopefully a quick question then. Um, so if expertise is very narrow, going back to your chart at the beginning, but we should identify the experts and believe them, right or wrong is do those two things make life difficult when you put them together?

Speaker 2:          53:07          MMM,

Speaker 1:          53:10          I don't think so. I mean there's another whole element of which experts you believe in you, you also have to believe that only in decent, honest experts and there's plenty of non decent dishonest experts around, but you need a different kind of argument. I mean there are different kinds of investigative technique to find out who those those are. I mean, the, the instant that I always use as my touchstone it, how to think about these things is the mumps, measles and rubella vaccination controversy. And a, this is one of the things that got me started in sort of big high to buy lots of people in social studies of science because I noticed that many of my colleagues in the field wanted to defend the parents, right? Not to vaccinate their children during the course of the mumps, measles, rubella controversy. And my view was that was terrible. And that in fact a parent had to vaccinate their children. And the reason is if you, if you look at what, uh, Andrew Wakefield, the person who started the whole controversy said, if you look at his paper in the Lancet, I was reading it just the other day actually, he had no evidence at all

Speaker 1:          54:30          that mumps, measles and rubella vaccine, we'll link to autism. There's lots of allusions and asides in that original paper. But the paper says we haven't proved it and he certainly hadn't approved it. And if you allow a panic like this to arise, it was very much a amplified by the press who have a view that they should always tell a balanced story. Will that balanced story? It was about,

Speaker 2:          54:55          yeah,

Speaker 1:          54:56          on the one side we're parents poor things who'd seen their children become autistic a little while after receiving the MMR vaccine. And the other side of the balance was the huge epidemiological studies, which showed that nowhere where MMR vaccine had been introduced into countries. Was there any increase in the instance of MMR in a population? And the latter thing is the end of the story. The parents, we're always going to see

Speaker 1:          55:25          some children going becoming autistic after they'd been injected with MMR because both things happen about same age. Okay. And there would be an equal number of children who nobody would be talking about who would have re who would have received the MMR just after becoming autistic, but nobody was talking about them. So all this balancing in the newspapers and so on was wrong. And one of the arguments that really infuriated me by one of my colleagues was, but look, there might be up there is a possibility that some small sex subsection of children who are peculiarly vulnerable in some way were affected by the MMR vaccine. The epidemiological statistics are two large scale to deal with that. And of course he was absolutely right, but you could make exactly the same argument for whether people became autistic just after eight in the Kiwi fruit for the first time or anything else you'd like.

Speaker 1:          56:20          So if you allow this kind of non-expert inference from observational statistics to enter the public domain, you can waste all your national health service money on scares and never get anywhere. I mean the whole argument is always carried out under the constraint of scarcity. And so it's an, it's not a question of what absolutely right. In the longterm, it probably is the case that one or two kids are vulnerable to MMR. But it's no good saying it. It doesn't get you to the policy answer. So that's my answer to your question. So, so it, does that answer your question? Okay. Thank you very much, Professor Harry Collins.

Speaker 2:          57:01          [inaudible].
