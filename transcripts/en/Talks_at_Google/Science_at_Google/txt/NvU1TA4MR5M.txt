 password 8 characters :00:06          So hydro, everyone, my name is Pablo Rodriguez. I am from south of his pain was currently working on doing maybe to the Barcelona isn't the Institute of Marine Sciences which is close to personae Davita. I don't know if you have therapy there. Um, so my research topic for my phd is mostly focusing bio chemistry. So bio chemistry, science that involves biology, geology and chemistry. So the change, essentially what we do is to research what the elements of the periodic table do on the earth, right? How I trucking moves in the ecosystem. How Carol, how sulfur nitrogen to right. So I'm here at the, to do in our research this day of a month, I was last year too, in order to use computer science to understand the biological chemical cycles that are in the ocean because that what we do focusing the oceans, um, what we studying is how the oceans, it speaks to the oceans is speak with the atmosphere, right? So many of you know, CO2, which is our gas, which has many important effects on the atmosphere. But there are also many gases that we call trace gases because the concentration is so is too low that they have important roles too.

Speaker 1:          01:20          So today's the world oceans day. And the first thing I like to ask you is why oceans? Because actually if we think the earth is a map, right? Which the way in which they bought and part it's not the land if the ocean, so how many oceans are here? So essentially as one, right? But mentally we can divide it in different oceans and obviously every ocean has different roles. So if we want to understand how the ocean works, the global oceans, we call it, we need to understand how it works in the different parts of it, right? So it's eventually, it's like a puzzle that you have one piece. You know how a process behaves in this part, how process behave in this part because you put everything together and you have the whole thing. So when I was had a child, I really love exploration.

Speaker 1:          02:11          I was born in Cartagena, which is a city in the south of Spain. And he's very famous because it hustled of history. This is a Roman theater was, yeah, Roman theater, one of the oldest one in the world. Um, this is the boat is there. If there's various research vessel, which is the Polaris money special and the base of the of the vessel is, is in my home phone. So since I was a teller, really loves the exploration and science and these kinds of things. So this is the first picture of the, of the earth. They came for Apollo Eight, right? That's the first picture of the year taking from the space for a human being. So that's the moon surface and there is the year there. So as we can see, the earth is blue. So then blue marble, I don't know if you have forever Lisa, these different with this famous phrase like near blue marble from you, from people like cars, Saigon. Um, so, but until we can see clouds, belts are important, right? So we can see that these thing blue, it has wide and also the continent, which is Africa.

Speaker 1:          03:21          So let's here, if we assume it in the picture, I mean we will have this, this, this view of the years, but this is not true. I'm actually [inaudible] clouds are missing away. Clouds are important. Clouds are white. That's where y'all views, right? Assaulting these flies, Eh, it's helps you. For example, if you are, if you have to do a sport in summer academies is you, you have really high temperatures but usually need to wear bright to life flows, right? So 40 years is the same, but the light art or, or the bright parts of the earth help the earth to make in schooler, right?

Speaker 1:          04:01          Called him Sir. And what? He sees so many thoughts. We has tally clouds when we are tutoring, right? Schools, high school, I usually teach her. Some professor told us, okay, so in order to have a cloud, you need the water to the sound light will hit the water on the ocean or a lake, whatever. The water will be evaporated. We'll go through the atmosphere and eventually we'll condense. I saw magic, you will have a cloud, right? But the truth is that this is not that simple, right? So you need articles, we did the small particles that are floating in the atmosphere in which the water that water molecules [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          04:43          Right? So these articles can be from the industry, can be it cars for example of her, I mean for all you've done last film, even they can be viruses, they're flowing in the atmosphere and the water can come dance. So you have these particle, the water condensing the particle and after they be called many of them to winter. So you have small cloud droplets and eventually if you have many small droplets, you will have a cloud. So it's not that simple, right? This is the western her, um, this is Saharan dust, right? Which is really important for these processes. So all this does, it goes from the desert to the ocean and up in the atmosphere helping these cloud formation processes. Right? And also this dust, yes, for eternal can go from here to the Amazon rain forest 30 license. Right? So this is sort of so important. I usually, so that's why you okay ms three B now we're not the atmosphere, the ocean Dalon on everything is connected some way somehow. Right?

Speaker 1:          05:53          But these higher fires that also contributes to them to them. I Aerosol particle budget in the atmosphere industry as I said before. So they got them the amount of energy that the earth can reflect right from the song. We call it the Albedo effect. So the higher the number in the border, right? The better for us because the temperature will be lower, right? This is a victory. We take out all the clouds if we take him out, all of them. So we will have the Albedo from the desert, which are quite right too for the polar regions. Um, the ocean on the elevator from the ocean, which is something we can say that this narrative, right? Because it's really dark. So we have an Albedo effect factor of zero point 15 but if we include clouds is a dabble of it. So essentially belts are really important.

Speaker 1:          06:59          So I told you that the dust on the particles in the industry, they go to the asthma sphere. Also from the deserts, but even leading beings like blondes, they can release their articles, right? Or gas is that when they are oxidizing the atmosphere with the react, we're reacting. We felt were compounds come from particles, also CIS also sea salt. So eventually you put all of this and this, and this is simulation obviously, but you can see that the in the atmosphere, the way this article Travis or of the worries, very amazing right away we started out. So most of, most of us we know about climate change. That's another, it's, it's a dumb thing. It doesn't matter. So all we all know that temperature will increase by the end of the 21st century. But the dependence on the way we will meet if we are made to more, more signature les Sia too.

Speaker 1:          07:52          If we change land uses are not in many things but, but anyway, even if we reduce everything, even if we are stalled, temperature is going to increase. Right? But the problem is that how much that's the key west. So we have different scenarios and the Democrats are down in the old, more optimistic. In the most optimistic scenario, temperature can increase made end of the century zero point suite and in the worst lung up to five. Right. And why is that? Well, Ferris because of the of the eight scenarios, right. But second, because there are many processes that we don't know, we don't know well yet, right? If you see the error of ours. So essentially the aerosol particles I was telling you, or club interaction, I also radiation, they come through with the highest error taught anthropogenic forcing on climate. Right?

Speaker 1:          08:57          So what, what I eat, what to work with my, with my phd's, we should call April theses. So the Cli, both SEZ solving, it's not a policy is he's not this, not solving that real [inaudible] are fucked. And you will see that they all the, the the, some, sorry, kids. The, the, the surface of the ocean. The ocean worlds, right. You see, as the ocean warms, their feet upon zone will grow because leaving beans are happy when the temperature east side, right? Nope. Health much higher. Uh, they were quite happy when they're, when they're quite hubby, they began to release some of these trace gases, almost these compounds like vms, the mythical suicide, right? These trace gases, they go to the other moss here, right? And they, they react with soul for, and they increased the concentration of song compounds that eventually will become particles, right?

Speaker 1:          09:53          We help to create clouds. So essentially it's like the microorganism are able to react to the warm up the waters on create like an umbrella for them, right? This is not something, I mean, let's say true because obviously Mike Organism, they kind of think, right? They don't do that in purpose. But essentially this is a reaction we task. We can go here in many places and Angelie like everything is science. Things are Moscow employee things are much more complex than that, right? So we have these trace gases. We tire since elite Guy, she is produced by the biological ecosystem. We targeted organism leaving in the surface. Right? But also we have other kind of aerosols like when the, when the waves, for example, date when they break, right? They released some Cecil articles that go to the atmosphere too. So it's such a complex thing, right?

Speaker 1:          10:48          And this is the thing, at least contributing more to the Eh, to the answer. Dainty leveling, climate change projections for this century. So this is on a Ieg, all of representation of the south and ocean and the Arctic Ocean, right? So you can see there being ways you're going to see seals can see the famous creel over there, right? You see the career. So what I do for a Btb, these partner, obviously the sizes are not the real, right? So this is like a micro organism. This organism can be one millimeter, right? So this is not, it's not real that you can see there. These are postop, this purple stuff going from the ocean into the atmosphere. These are trace gases that where we started the, eventually they become articles and they will help in clubs, formation processes, but also, but also they are like eh, signals for some animals like seagulls. So when a seagull is flying right, they don't see what he's below the water. Obviously there, if there is something like an oil lacy, but if they want to break Krill, they usually see the critical and their flight, but they kind of Smelly, right? So these trays, Garcia or Natalia important because they held in the cloud formation versus, but also they're important chemical signals for animals.

Speaker 1:          12:11          If we think in the ocean, we all have seen documentaries, right? And we usually tend to think that the ocean is something we taste and full Wales Delphine's, um, being this dumpy, but actually the old Chinese, it's mostly empty. All of these big animals, right? The mostly for my bacteria by microbes. So they all kind of St Helia microbial soup. Um, the visit, the number over kills bacteria and the ocean, which is one all by 13 zero s

Speaker 2:          12:40          yeah.

Speaker 1:          12:41          Um, I was telling you about the gassy. So these are the trace gas has to, for my phd, which is called ISO bring. And he says [inaudible] trace gas, which is produced inside every cell on the earth doing photosynthesis. Every sale on the earth. The task plastics. Right, which are the Oregon's where we're focusing is produced. Right. But these mostly produced by, by land and by lung plans, router down Fido Bunco we teach that we charged a microbial organism leaving in the ocean that are able to do for the census is right. You may think why is important. Well it goes to the lifetime in the atmosphere of these trace gases. So east really low, really low. Um, so they have lost enough time to travel from one continent to another word like this, a higher on dust, right? So lifetime lifetime from two to three hours.

Speaker 1:          13:35          So when I saw is releasing the ocean, it reacts immediately in this area or in a really close area, right? So the clouds that are formed there, they came from these, they are produced by these trace gases. That's the importance of Elvis studying these trace gases in the ocean. And also because the ones that are in meat in, in England, they are interacting with some anthropogenic. Yes, he's on par. Two goals for an industry. Um, these are these kind of things. So these are some of the organisms living in the, in the surface ocean, and they do the photosynthesis on day release. These compounds, the the dope, right of the big, you can see progress locos broker, Coco's Isa, back to your plant them, which is how bacteria is able to perform photosynthesis, right on these organisms. It was discovered by the MIT in the early India, late eighties in early 19 so when I was born, this organism didn't even exist. He just seeks whether we didn't know, right? So this is the most abundant organisms on earth and this is the most abundant organisms able to do the photosynthesis. And actually I've already into some estimates from the 20% or from the, you can say 15% 25% of the seeking. We are briefing here. It has been produced by disorganizing and 28 years ago, 27 years say, well, we didn't even know that these organismic seasons. So the ocean is salt in that there are, we have many things to this core steel.

Speaker 1:          15:10          Well, what I do, so I use my deposit down models, physical models. This is a model for an ETA for my collaborators. And here you can see the ocean currents, how they change during the on every season. Did you kind of see that some parts are dark, dark, sorry, which means that the speed is pretty high, right? So you can see that the itself and often it's in the south and ocean, right? I mean it's not something like like a Tom see something really cold. This is like the tasks like rivers flowing inside, right? So this is the biology. So this is the way these micro organism called phytoplankton, they're able to do photosynthesis change through the year. You can see it's brain arrives and they blew, they booming build. So the mission of these trace gases in the seasons is higher

Speaker 1:          16:07          of what else? So we have, we have these smaller, which is like a physical model, right? But we also need to know how the marine ecosystem works, right? So we have the w that's like alarm. So you have the primary production errors you have to consumers. You have the predates hours, right? So, so do you have nutrient you need to know, which is the amount of nutrients they have in we in the south and ocean for example. How many species are producers? You want Tom in his pieces are per day tours. You will. So this is the here, it looks really simple that eventually this is a, this is a really big branch of regulations including one mall. What we do here, what I'm doing here for my phd is yes, putting off this to wherever. So we have the physical framework with the car runs and production or whatever. So we have like assist cause he's taking a diagram. Let's say we know how the ecosystem, how the microbial ecosystem works in the south and ocean. And we also know which amount of these trace gases are MEP by every cell. And eventually we put all of these Twitter so we can estimate for a couple day meeting a Pfizer bring in the whole south and ocean,

Speaker 2:          17:23          right?

Speaker 1:          17:26          Well this is the Muslim part. This is the, let's say the mathematical part, but we need data and if we need data, we need to travel really far and we need to do all Shannon, graphic cruises, oceanographic institutions. So these are the views from my, from my Kevin I to be living inside here like two months discouraged in the English Channel when we were sailing for a long course or in Germany to South Africa. So the first career that at the first cruise, how you participate in order to measure these compounds and see how the, how they are releasing the ocean was these ones are as big as 20 2014. We are starting to spin and we arrive to South America, these salient the Atlantic Ocean Marcy, if ways you have to be there like working, everyone gets the sea to everyone gets DC. I mean some people say you know, I know everyone at some point gets dizzy

Speaker 1:          18:28          but what if you want to go to the south and altering? So this is south, I'm very candid and Arctic peninsula, you can see this, this here, that's there. We'll see. Um, so if you want to reach this self an ocean, you need to cross the Drake passage, right? The Drake passage is the most dangerous place in the world for sale. I don't know if you like salient, but if you see this bold races that every year when they have to grow through there is a total mess for us. It's easier because our bolts are bigger. They are not, they are investors. There are not both there, they are not sailing boats at all. So it's very easy. Now the point is that you have a belt of storms coming every field, every three days, and the time that the storms is there is three days to under time.

Speaker 1:          19:16          Do you have to spend in order to go from South America to Antartica three days to an hour rate. So the point is that you have to be there waiting and there was term going. That's the moment you start with the boat trying to reach Antarctica before and he has term we'd arrive, right? It's a very difficult place to be. So we performed these screens, which is called Picasso. Um, we went to these areas, health and all. So that's South America. Um, that they need to laugh. We have a been wing, which was really happy with us and he jumped into the Cilia. Um, so we went with this research vessel here you have the proof that this is

Speaker 3:          20:00          sure

Speaker 1:          20:03          there look at a deficit for real. I don't know. So they're usually, depending on the place you go on Antarctica and usually animals are not really used to human means, right? So they don't respect you. So even a being we teach like it's like a feature of their, it's like a seagull is like one of the ease of the, he's an animal that is prey by most of the rest of the others. They don't even care about you jump there on their board,

Speaker 3:          20:35          they jump up.

Speaker 1:          20:38          This is how it looks when you are crossing the Drake passage from South America too on [inaudible] gun. These are the people we were there working to better sell how we weren't there. So we sample it many different ways. So this one is for something they micro layers and the micro surface layer of the ocean. So essentially we introduce one plate of glass and then must surface layer of the ocean get stuck on it. And after we cleaned like this, uh, we, we, we get these syrups in this order. In order to feel this bottle, we need to spend like one hour there. So this is [inaudible], right? So we have small boats inside the big bolt that we use sampling over there said you're going to see in the background, uh, an ice layer. We also use these, these sermon, which is called Rosette CTD. Russell. This is the most iconic instrumenting ocean sciences, right?

Speaker 1:          21:41          So you can see there, it looks like, um, well essentially you have all of these are bottles, right? And every bottle has an amber. So Judy ploy this instrument and you deploy it until the border for the seat or until the, that you want, right? When it's going down, it's measuring, right? But it's going now, especially Sanford, her measures for inventory to her. So let me did measure that so you can see how it looks, the ocean, how it will, how is the vertical profiles or of their main properties of the ocean, let's say. And when you recover it and he's going, you can tell from the boat to every bottle. So open up, open up distance, you can tell the bottom number six. So you will be open to their port, 400 meters. So under the bottle number, five to 100 meters, whatever. When you got it back on the boat and you put it here that you have different models and every Volvo has the water, a different debt.

Speaker 1:          22:42          She says mark way of sampling rather than going with a submarine or are these kind of things we start which are really expensive. So that's the way we usually pick the water from the depot. We don't go, it's so marines or, or we don't dive there. So we use these kind of instrument which has been used in during the last decades. We also perform experiments or more. So these containers, they're, they have water pumping from the and directly. Um, so in order to keep the same temperature in the ocean done in these boxes let's say, and there we have small borders, we've committed different fighter on communities there we see how they react with the, with, with the light or in our conditions. This that with all day? Both as is you on a test. We also big eyes. That's me. Begin some eyes. And why we big eyes with an axe. Because I mean you can see here in this picture, this is not fear the ice, right? So you could go see inside the eyes. They're leaving beans too. So you start the ice. We have phytoplankton too and they live there, right? So on this such an important thing because actually Kareel usually eat these federal bundle. They go below the ice and this carotid.

Speaker 1:          24:05          So these are, it's almost the organism done the we found inside the eyes. So to make sure at least full of leaving means,

Speaker 2:          24:11          okay,

Speaker 1:          24:12          do we participate also in the ace Murray Team University, which was a universe, a cruise. What started him Bremerhaven Germany onto the South Africa. That was a cruise that we were scientists working there, but also 50th students from all over the world. We sold many things like flying few, she's, I don't know if you have ever seen them. And we were on the academics first Nichols research vessel. And this project was funded by the Swiss polar incidents, which is around by you, this fiscal Roman Ada, t VFL, um, older institutions for [inaudible]. So this is how our lab look like, right? We were setting up the lobby, not moment. You can see there the [inaudible] the, and I told you it's quite claustrophobic. Everything, right? So,

Speaker 2:          25:05          okay.

Speaker 1:          25:06          Pretty smile. Pretty small, no windows he sees around him. The Baltimore Sun, the cables, all used to be the finest thing is you are on a basal, so everything moves, right? So do you have to tie everything to the walls? Even the chairs are there. They're tied to the floor, right? So everything kind of be, I mean, everything has to be really stable because if you have a festo literally chairs for example, they come eat will love them. The MV flying over the rooms.

Speaker 2:          25:39          Okay.

Speaker 1:          25:39          So on last year we participate the, well, two years ago must be right. That's you're actually [inaudible] Felicia as well. So cruises, starting from Africa. Um, but, uh, after we went to Hobart in Australia, [inaudible], rns in South America and Africa again, so it was that whole street navigation of Antarctica. What's was the first time, uh, an international expedition has done it all history by Internet. We found scientific age, right? Um, so Liesel fly a squeeze. I don't know if you, if you knew that we'd have flying fishes on the ocean was also playing a squids. I have to recognize that I have even know eat until, until that moment that they exist. Um, so we sold many keeping [inaudible] Kim being green, which is the second biggest one after the ember of being me. Um, yes. [inaudible] he's coming in. We are interested. So the expedition was divided in three different legs, on every leg was more or less one month, right on a park. You see facing the first one.

Speaker 3:          26:45          Okay.

Speaker 1:          26:46          I said, these are some pictures. This is camping with this is many of them do better having baby big means on everything. So they, I saw Davis Hill, how one of them was killed by these school us. Um, um, or over seagulls, partner's health and ocean. So this is [inaudible] speaking. It's like real like otherwise.

Speaker 3:          27:19          Okay.

Speaker 1:          27:20          Um, this one will be able through some of the, when we were starting from Cape Town oldest, so we were there. So you can see that the usually east really cloudy and the weather is good. So if you see documentaries with being weaned on the song, that's not the normal thing. They're usually really, that's how we work. So in the same place, we have to have, we have plans, we have the here, so we have the meetings because I usually do, they'll hop so many saloons on level. So this space is really sweetie pie. You said all of these old, the kinds of things we were doing this course. So these people, they were launching balloons and Isabelle Lewis are used to measure the properties of the atmosphere. For example, deploying many different instruments.

Speaker 3:          28:19          Okay.

Speaker 1:          28:20          What is this? So when I show this picture to high schools to this, they told me what this is. I Dunno. Is Saturn or Jupiter or our planet? So this is the Pacific Ocean. So if you, if you use, obviously you do because you do use Google earth, did you slept? I mean if you do a little bit be a buck, so you will find these, the Pacific Ocean is massive. Something that big that you can pull all the continents, all the land inside the Pacific Ocean. And after that you will have, you will leave a little bit of Pacific Ocean. The Pacific Ocean is really big and as you can see there are clouds there. So what we have done this year, we went to these points in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, which is Maria Island in the French Polynesia. I don't know if you know where you start heating so close with the heat either. It's Maria. I love. So we were there in order to study these trace gases emission on by Murray. Microsoft's, uh, that was all the worry microbes that are also from Colorado. Reese is coral reef. They have differing in coral reef ecosystems or they can't have different behavior or sunny spot and touristy. So you have until the s I told you in the beginning. So you need to, you need to understand the ocean as a possible. So you need to know how all of these is. These are in every part of the ocean.

Speaker 1:          29:40          So that's Maria Island. And we

Speaker 3:          29:42          were there, he said the island, it's pretty cool. So we were leaving here on these houses on the one day, but it was really beautiful at night. And this is unreal. I mean usually these kind of, I mean when you came from the south and ocean and you are right to the tropic tropical island, like this is really funny because he's like living in an aquarium and you every time you die, if it's like you cannot believe what you are saying because he's, it's like fake, but it's not fake. It's full of chorus and everything. So this is the research team. We were there. We were yesterday team people from four different, if it were for four different countries for new year over in the states, from China, from Australia, from, uh, Spain. Um, from friends too. Okay.

Speaker 1:          30:33          This is the boat we use on that cruise. That of course we'll either, they pull us in our careers, we were working from a night on the right. So every, every day we do them all down. We went sampling. And this is the day, for example, in this picture, what we are doing is deploying this rally your meter, which is an instrument that you can use for measure. How, how, how's the, how, what is the, I mean, who, how are the properties of the light and below the surface water. So how lights be gay with the Dev, for example, which is an indicator of the turbidity and these kind of things. And that's me working on the boat. So you have to, uh, the, he's the driver of the boat. Tony and I used to spend many hours close to his feet working there. We follow the coating. So essentially it's like you have like really fancy instrument and really expensive things, but mentally you are, you know, you need to do, you need to adapt to the circumstances.

Speaker 1:          31:32          Um, so we, uh, we were doing, I mean, when we went with the bolt sampling, for example, in Maria Aiello pictures from the right, so when we saw how this is the day in green, you have the chlorophyll, which is an indicator of the productivity of a community or, or the water, like say let's say. So we saw that in the basic productivity was higher than out of the reef and inside the roof. So that's the thing we usually do. And we went to this small atolls in the, in the north, which is [inaudible]. And here you have the bigger picture. Um, so an angel is the, it's not, I mean this angel, it was really different. And I'm Maria, right? Um, it has inside that legroom and on the productivity there was really high. It was much higher than out of the whole of the island, which was something really surprising for us. So the last thing I would like to tell you, it's about science and society, right? So these kind of things are very important. And you also, you have to explain them to the people. You have to explain it to society.

Speaker 1:          32:39          So this is model, it's not a spin expedition, right? Was an expedition performing an 18th century. Like by, by his thing, it was the first IMT if [inaudible] the award sampling, leaving curators for an island. So many different things. So in 2010 so eight years ago, there was a Malaspina expedition, which was a cruise sailing around the ocean, right? Again, buzz, I spill Roman, you see some feel really cool. So you have a massive bold full of scientists traveling around the world. In seven months. We see something that you may think, well, this is so easy to reach. So easy to engage with the people on the pneumonia. I was on my bachelor and I used to read the blog and this wasn't as block. So it's that. So here you have, I mean, you don't have to read it, but no pictures, no movies, no nothing.

Speaker 1:          33:33          So do you have people sailing around the globe doing really cool science? You percentage like this? Um, I'm actually this, this, this is how this one, the, the offer of this writing is one of the most famous is fine. It's Fraser says you will have on the boat one of the best writers on the ward and you are doing really cool things and you present it like this with no parochial media though. No Twitter, no Facebook, no nothing. So he mentally, no one will really few people. It's going to read this unless you're a freak like me, but if you want to engage, but if you want to engage with these people, millennials. Huh? Well I did relation on the two younger ones. So you need to use social media. Um, I agree with mine with my partner at spoke in September, 2014, you know, are very good splay. They said these eh, um, to, to explain and to read. But you expedition, as I told you before, it will seem both focusing on storytelling, adventure of the challenges of science on, do you athlete from assign these to the public or ma, I'm mostly focusing in John People. So we have read them most in all of these different places on their war, which he's quite and quite cool in 40 years. This is what I wanted to tell you. Thank you. And if you have any question, we'll be happy to answer.

Speaker 4:          35:02          And those results, did you get from all these experiments?

Speaker 1:          35:08          Every on every ocean is different on every experiments different. So the results we have with the Easter, depending, for example, depending on the photo blogs and Spc. So because you may think, well if these tourists gas is related to chlorophyll, so chlorophyll molecule, which is the same, the water of the organism, the molecule is the same. So do you may think so maybe can we kind of link the productions of discuss? Yes. To glorify him, but actually it doesn't work that, so depending on this PC, even no matter of the chlorophyll of the level of chlorophyll of this PC, so the mission can be different if the two basic gases. But what does the response team were fun.

Speaker 3:          35:49          Yeah.

Speaker 5:          35:54          I have a question from one of the people who is not in this room. Um,

Speaker 3:          35:59          yeah,

Speaker 5:          35:59          he's thinking more towards the global warming those. So he says that every time our, our CEO and our higher ups talk about machine learning, he talks about the example of climate change modeling and he's asking if you're aware of machine learning initiatives to improve these models. But it seems like climb on modeling within 150 years of data is still a good candidate for applying machine learning to such, uh, such research. So what, what's kind of your viewer experience?

Speaker 1:          36:27          Well, tell you what would I do with the models I use. I mean, I'm not that modal little over and then we'll usually usually, right. So actually my intention with this mall's either he's not, I mean the, the final goal of this obviously is to help the people do project the climate. My Jaquelle goals, right? Uh, I am a word and now they're using these, these machine learning things for incubation community, bloody of the malls and also quantum quantum computing to, so yes, I'm thinking something that is a hot topic now. It's currently, I mean, that's what my goals, but I'm not that, I have no extra pieces of that.

Speaker 3:          37:07          Yeah.

Speaker 5:          37:12          That's all because really enjoyable. Um, I'm wondering on your whole research team, how many people go out into the field and gather the data and how many people stay home and write code and run models. And how's the interaction between you? Because I'm considering,

Speaker 1:          37:33          well, it depends on the cruise, right? For example, in one of the crews, the one that we did in these, in these oceanographic vessel like this, we, that's the Spanish basal. So we have like 35 births for us, so that we were like 30 scientists to, were working still. Did people love do millennia stuff? He's come face, usually they stay on them, but some nice not right. Um, so for example, in these groups, we were 30 scientists in the cruise that we did around on 30 guy from my research group. We, yes. Got Two places. So we were just too, it's funny is people there and we were, you know, [inaudible] tiller every month. Um, so it depends on the groups and on the island. The smallest of April, we were 13 people. So yeah, he depends on the also it depends obviously the, the, the more people you have the better because you can do more things and you kind of have more data about this.

Speaker 1:          38:32          Skanska Lee is something that you need to, I mean it's a kind of science that is quite complex because isn't it? Clearly you have to take your lab. I'm more with, I feel that we take our lab and we put it inside the boat and the boat is never in Barcelona. So we have to go to Germany or to whatever and you need to take all of our instruments there. We put in a boat and sales around the world and after you became out of, um, so he's, that's a complex thing. But I want to say that that's expensive too. So the more people, the better, the more people, the more expressive abilities. So the St Kelly, do you need to think? I need to, you need to have, clearly you're and I will, what I have, what I want to do to these people. You're not, so usually try to keep the number of people a slower as possible, um, that will help you to have your, your scientific goals. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          39:34          So you mentioned, uh, different types of photosynthesis has different,

Speaker 1:          39:40          uh,

Speaker 4:          39:41          to affect like the amount of pipe and Joseph mission by net amount of bacteria, or at least

Speaker 1:          40:12          it's mostly because of the animals of the animals off the plant. Right. So, so the bigger is going to be producing it, so there'd be your east always needed more than what we produce is the same way if you read, do our release in Morsia too than, um, than a mouse problem. So it's something similar to that. So you have more biomass, all that Mark Morford doesn't getting higher biomass on land. I mean the old, but the point is that their bio mass in the ocean, so it becomes recycled faster, you know, because they're essentially microbes. Right. And they die, but they, they can be by the cells. You have to offend. You have free. So the bio mass is lower than in Donny land past. Yeah. That's reasonable. Not One I had. No, I did. Uh, did I include the side? Okay. Okay. Ah, yeah. That's my, that's my, that's my two, three theater user if you mean. Oh yeah. Okay. Well is the same.

Speaker 3:          41:32          Yeah.

Speaker 5:          41:34          So you said that, but he's the plans to release more as a friend because they are important. Why is it not the same with oxygen? You said that to the oxygen is mostly released by these microbes.

Speaker 1:          41:45          Well because that's how you're really good as good as him because I actually did a, we usually land ecosystems, right? They love steak. The plus data for the, but they also, they bring, let's say they also consume oxygen sometimes, right? So when you have an ecosystem which is mature, right? Like the rain forest, they're producing data. They are producing a little of folks senior about, they're consuming a lot of oxygen to cells. Hailey, you're, your balance is lady some, some parts of the London ecosystem is zero. So I think the older and these organisms are dying and leaving the gang. I'm the level. So he's play is that's heavy for the thing. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          42:35          I sailed through a tall ship through the Drake's passage half a year ago and yeah, it was really bad. Um, I wanted to comment on, on your common desk. Um, like research vessels, like the one that I was on, we could use money for like keeping the business after running a day. Also collect samples. Uh, like we used to measure part of our daily chores was to measure the water temperature and sometimes the examples and um,

Speaker 2:          43:10          okay,

Speaker 5:          43:10          these data, is he 42 some other agencies? I don't remember exactly where in exchange for a small amount of money in my understanding was that this kind of research feeds, uh, is kind of small samples. Data feeds into like larger research at a global level and there are other boats like this that you can volunteer on or you can just join them for, I don't know, five weeks from Cape Town to the Azores. Or I went from [inaudible] to Ben Antarctic Peninsula and back in those 22 days or the same, uh, shy Antarctic pennies. Ah, AH, Georgian islands in Cape Town. And we collected the sword of samples every eight hours come whatever kind of weather and dizziness and so on. So I think there's maybe opportunity if you're interested to look into what kind of research these data ends up being used for and if there's some sort of more intelligent machine learning and things that we could, or one could contribute if there's interest.

Speaker 2:          44:22          Okay.

Speaker 5:          44:28          Have some sort of website like that and probably that was, yeah,

Speaker 3:          44:38          yeah.

Speaker 1:          44:41          Uh, Evan to lead, you can join us on a research cruise, but actually in order to, that was healthy that the has been doing like during the last day. It's like, yeah, yes. Launching those hills and people doing, they're measuring enough, they're sharing everything and put everything together. Now this trend is seen of these quite trendy is the Argo float. I don't know if you have deliver ever listen about Argo floats. So essentially there are boys, right? Like these ones,

Speaker 1:          45:09          can you help me low? Can you go there you go, hold on. And they seem to not have two satellites on there. So they are perfect. They're not simply floating there. Go with deeper Nicola afterwards. So on the, so the Argo flower, the Argo floats, sorry, are all the argue boys that are in the ocean, which is this in February, 2018. Right? So the ocean as many of these are the flows. Um, usually they own most of them. I mean, almost every gun three they have a group in charge of deploying the Argo floats. Do do is change the Chantilly, deploy them on when they uh, run off battery elder butter. He said you've picked them up and you do repairs and you launch it again, which is so thing, which is cheaper than send people is safer to me girls, if our boy becomes broken, no one's eyes.

Speaker 3:          46:01          Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          46:18          Okay. So,

Speaker 3:          46:21          uh,

Speaker 5:          46:21          it says you are studying what looks like a positive feedback loops towards global warming. Any chances it can offset the major negative feedback loops? Like I'll be the loss from ice melting. COC decreasing Sio two storage, permafrost, melting releases, ch four and so on.

Speaker 3:          46:40          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          46:41          What is that with climate change? And usually because, I mean we, we, we usually tends to understand climate change as global warming. Exactly it is now is global warming. But if you have a really high global warming, do you even count, you know, gloves she'll glacial period. Right. So something quite tricky. For example, if, if all of the, for example that he or he was saying if the, if the ice melts in the Arctic for example, so the temperature of the ocean will be higher on a, I don't really, if you are a word, the heating machine of the earth are, the oceans are saying Kelly, you half a convention belt hole throw the oceans, which is called a terrible Holly circulation. Um, east a saint. Really it's like a river. You just slowly for a one place to another one transporting eat, right. So if they'll sharing, for example, if the Arctic, I mean we are in Switzerland, I don't know if you, well you know, Love Madrid for example, because the lesson it is more or less in the same latitude than New York, but the temperature is totally different. You, your patent, you have seen movies, bright eyes response, every face full of snow. And usually in Spain we don't have that. Or, or in Lisbon, which is largely to that is because in the North Atlantic Ocean we have this commercial belt of, of water, which is called the Emoc, a mock Lutie, Stearns, Arctic, very regional overturning circulation.

Speaker 1:          48:16          So then we're warm waters that are, that they have, they have, I mean they, the, they have, they are warm because the, the signing day waiter gets the water that the water flows north of low self do as health an ocean to the article in the Atlantic Ocean, right when they arrive to the North Pole or the Arctic, they get to cool David colder. Right? And if they are cooler, they go down, right? So they go down after they are doing their way back but below. Right. And this has had an atmos very clean too. So essentially we have this warm temperatures in, in Europe rather than in America because of this, because of the circulation. But if the Arctic is warmer, the CFTC stipulation, the mock can be, can be broken or can be, um, or, or your, or even if that's regulation is just lower. It kind of really changed the whole of Europe. And it will be colder. So mentally, if you do have a lot of a lot of flow where you can have a glass show and not a glacial period, or maybe a glacial period, but much lower 10 producing places of you have never had, well, we have never had in the last selenium's.

Speaker 3:          49:39          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          49:41          Such a drinking game.

Speaker 2:          49:46          Thanks. See you.
