Speaker 1:          00:06          Nikola Tesla, um, you guys getting a bit of a popular revival, um, imparts as we were mentioning. Um, it's because your boss, um, not long ago refer to him as a hero. Everybody's thinking, oh my gosh, if Larry Page thinks he's a hero, maybe we need to learn a little bit more. And then suddenly Elon Musk decides that he's got a car company and you know, a, a, a car that's named after this character. So, um, who the heck is he? There's sort of two broad categories of at least those folks that sort of know something about him. At least my experience is one says that he's the superman that has provided us these amazing inventions that underlying our economy. The other side says that he's kind of quirky. Like he's an odd character. I mean, he, you know, upper whores jewelry, he gets a fever, or if he looks at a peach, he counts his steps as he walks in.

Speaker 1:          01:00          If they're not divisible by three, he has to go back and do as an whole journey again. Um, so that you've got this sort of contrast. But I guess what I want to do for, you know, maybe about 20, 25 minutes or so, I always talk a bit about some observations that I came up with in the course of doing the research. Things that sort of surprised me. That may surprise you. Hopefully a, and then I'd welcome having actually just having a dialogue, um, answering some questions about what you want to know, um, or no, uh, about this, uh, remarkable individual. Um, so let me start with just, um, my first observation, I was unaware of the extent of his genius. This man got 300 patents. Uh, he invented the electric motor. He invented long distance electricity transmission according to the United States Supreme Court. He provided us the, uh, the basics of radio.

Speaker 1:          01:55          He did remote control. He did robots. I mean, the list goes on. Um, according to the American Institute of Electrical engineers were we to seize and eliminate from our industrial world. The result of Mr Tesla's work, the wheels of industry would cease to turn. Our towns would be dark. And that's not all long after his death. His visions inspired great minds. I mean, he foresaw cell phones, radar laser weapons, artificial intelligence, vertical lift airplanes, cell phones, for instance. It's guys about 110 years ago, he's talking about a device that can provide news, um, and you know, stock prices and all sorts of information. And he said, we shall see and hear one another as perfectly as though we were face to face despite innovating distances of thousands of miles. A man will be able to carry one and his vest pocket 110 years ago. He had invented, but he sort of thought about it.

Speaker 1:          02:55          Um, and that envisioning is I think quite amazing. He does come across as a bit of a magician. Um, he would do presentations at various universities and he would admit that electricity is this force that even physicists will admit they don't fully understand what it is. Um, but we, he was an others as well. We're able to capture it and utilize it. And in fact, last century you asked engineers as to what was the major accomplishment of the 20th century. They ignored inner, the internal combustion engine, the computer chip, all these other sorts of things. They said the most amazing thing was the ability to capture and transmit electric power. And this man, this magician, uh, was one of those. He created lightning. This was something that had been reserved only for nature, but he's zapped it all over the place. Um, you know, hundreds and hundreds of feet. He also made lamps glow.

Speaker 1:          03:56          They were not attached to wires. Um, so this man, um, was in fact a magician. But you should also recognize that he had some quixotic notions that, um, complicated as legacy or, um, made him more interesting depending upon your perspective. Uh, he spent a lot of time trying to figure out how to communicate with intelligent beings on other planets. He spent a lot of time trying to figure out how to read your mind by putting little monitors on near your retina. Um, so he was both practical as far as coming up with if you will, systems, uh, he was a visionary and thinking about new things that he couldn't actually make cause the equipment or, um, technology just wasn't there and he was also a little weird and off sometimes. And I think it's that combination that makes him so interesting. The second surprise for me, uh, as was noted, um, I'm an environmentalist.

Speaker 1:          04:57          I run the Midwest Office of the Environmental Defense Fund working on clean energy issues. And so for me to find out that, uh, Nikola Tesla, not only did he invent the electric motor, but he also was a clean energy pioneer. That to me was pretty exciting. Um, and he remains an inspiration I think to a variety of, you know, solar and battery manufacturers. The Elon Musk who we mentioned before has his car and his company named after him, but he contributed $1 million to revitalize the Tesla laboratory up on long island. Um, I actually work in a shared office space. It's a sort of a startup incubator and there is right 10 feet behind my desk. There is a full sized cutout of Nikola Tesla that at least I used to tell my wife, it was haunting me from behind to go home and write more. Um, but he has his leadership on clean energy began actually in 1900.

Speaker 1:          05:56          Um, about 118 years ago. He published an article in the century, which then was the nation's largest circulation periodical. It was entitled, the problem of increasing human energy with special references to the harnessing of the sun's energy. Again, published 118 years ago was probably the earliest, most detailed look at how to capture power from the sun and the wind for me as a, uh, an environmental advocate, um, he inspires me to think of if he was here today, what, how great it would be to focus on the electricity industry, which he helped start. But today largely because it is monopolized. In other words, the electric utilities have total control as many states over both the generation and the delivery of electricity. This industry has become innovation averse has become risk adverse and it's become stodgy is become frayed. The list goes on. If in fact Tesla was around, he'd be off thinking about how am I going to send power wirelessly, how I'm going to make it without um, having pollution.

Speaker 1:          07:04          How am I going to electrify other sectors of the economy, particularly transportation. How am I going to bring drudgery, saving electric power to everyone? Around the world, perhaps for free, including that we have 2 billion people on this planet that do not have access to electricity at this moment. He, in my mind, um, if he were with us today would be thinking outside of the box, um, away from the sort of the monopoly think that currently degrades that industry. My third surprise, um, was his constant attempt and need to balance the present and the future. Uh, call it apocryphal, call it weird color appropriate, but he was born during a giant lightening storm exactly at the stroke of midnight between the ninth and 10th of July, 1856. That's weird enough. Just in the midst of a gale. And this became part of Tesla Lore. You know, his family sort of thought this was, you know, this is how look a bit, um, you know, and he I think thought he was kind of special because he had this trait that he was born at this weird time for me as a biographer, I was able to get the sense that in fact, um, it, the birth story sort of figuratively placed him in the present as well as in the future.

Speaker 1:          08:36          It both today and tomorrow. And I think he spent his life trying to struggle to find this balance between focusing on current realities and envisioning the future, the unknown. And consider, for example, the year 1,897 he had just figured out how to transmit the enormous power from Niagara Falls, um, 26 miles all the way to buffalo and then a total of 400 miles down to New York City. This is huge because the technology that on Thomas Edison, who everybody looks towards of thinking he was the electrical genius. He however, favored direct current, which could basically move maybe half a mile, maybe a mile if you're lucky. Tesla was able to move this power 400 miles, the New York Times referred to this diag or a project as the unrivaled engineering triumph of the 19th century. And who did the paper give credit to? They said to Tesla belongs the undisputed honor of being the man whose work made this Niagara Project possible.

Speaker 1:          09:47          And of course there are statutes to or my both sides, Canadian, the United States. He did this amazing thing. He was praised by the Times at parties, et cetera. And he was bored. This was too much today. He had done this, he needed to look towards the future to create a new area of science. And he called this tell him autonics or what we might call a robotics. His initial project was a radio controlled model boat measured about, Oh, I dunno, four feet in length and maybe about three feet high. Um, and he, although he was rather shy scientist, he was capable of being a showman if he had to. Um, and so he had the debut of this Tele Matan at the Madison Square Garden. Huge arena. This is the old one. But this is where it happened during the electrical exposition in May, 1898, remember, this is about two months after the battleship Maine had blown up in Havana harbor.

Speaker 1:          10:55          We were in the midst of just the beginning of the Spanish American war. So there was a lot of interest in trying to figure out can we develop new weapons. And so here comes tests. He has this model boat. He builds a pond in the middle of the exhibition hall and he invites possible investors, reporters, um, other inventors and scientists. And He tantalized them for, you know, 15 or 20 minutes. He moved the boat backwards and forwards around the pond. Uh, he made a dance almost like a water bug. Um, and so everybody was mesmerized by this. You know, some people were thinking, there's a tiny monkey in there. I'm sure there's a tiny monkey in there. Uh, but then after a while he then turns to the audience and says, all right, who wants to ask the a question? Everybody's thinking. You don't ask boats questions, you know, some, um, probably future Google person came up and said, all right, what's the cube root of 64 and Tesla, you know, where this hand hidden on a lever underneath the, the panel arranges to flick the lights on the boat four times a.

Speaker 1:          12:02          And he said, uh, he created a sensation such as no other invention of mine has ever produced. His success of this was further highlighted by Mark County's failure. Remember Marconi as the one who's given public credit for wireless transmissions. But of about three months later, Mark County tried to do a very similar project, built his own pond. He built a, um, a model frigate that he was to guide over to what was referred to as the Spanish boat and it would have little bombs on it would blow the, you know, the tiny little Spanish boat to smithereens. Unfortunately, Marconi had not mastered how does send individualized messages. So when his assistant punched the button, the Spanish ship was just fine, but there was a loud explosion to the back room where mark had kept as miniature bombs. Uh, because that's where the signal when he hadn't figured out how to get it to the right spot.

Speaker 1:          13:04          Uh, and so there were loud blasts and smoke that went throughout the exhibition hall. Not surprisingly, Tesla was never satisfied with just, you know, a model boat and to the navy. He was not satisfied to suggest this was a submarine that would carry bombs to blow up a frigate that was kind of boring. You know, they're thinking it's a Spanish American war. This is great, but he thinks this is a new non biological form of life. This is a machine that is embodied with a borrowed mind. His mind of course happens to be his, um, but he's seeing artificial intelligence and it's predicting that this Tele Matan not only would quote follow a course laid out or obey commands given form in advance, but it will be be capable of distinguishing between what it ought and what it not ought to do. This again, over a hundred, some odd years ago, we were beginning to think in his mind about artificial intelligence.

Speaker 1:          14:10          My fourth surprise actually. And so I was telling Richard Di resulted from the discovery at the library of Congress, a boxes of letters that either Tesla had written or had been written to him by friends or colleagues at central. For a biographer, it's perspective. This is like Manna from heaven unit. Suddenly you get to see this man's voice, uh, in real time. What those letters showed, I think was an overlooked side to this remarkable genius. As I mentioned at the beginning, you've got the school of people who think that he was a superman, that one biographer called him a Supernova in the galaxy of the human race and no doubt the combination of electric motors, robots, remote control, you know, radio, these are all super accomplishments. I'm not taking anything away from that, but this scientist was also human and charmingly. So, and that was the fun part to sort of get behind and tell that story.

Speaker 1:          15:10          His closest friends were the Johnsons. Uh, Robert who edited the Century magazine, which I mentioned before, was the largest circulation periodical. And his wife Catherine, um, they operate in an intellectual salon at their townhouse in Manhattan's Murray Hill neighborhood. They were not particularly rich, but they sort of acted that way and they gathered around them, this cadre of writers, artists and sculptors and would have them over for all these great dinner conversations. Mark Twain came to most of these and he and Nikola Tesla became great friends. This is Mr Twain and Tesla. There is in the, uh, in the background. So he would come to Tesla's laboratory and the two of them would just play. They'd send electrical sparks across the room. They hold up, you know, Globes that were unconnected to wires and make them glow. They would ex-ray each other's hands. There were two kids having a great time in their laboratory.

Speaker 1:          16:13          They just happen to be the genius, the engineering genius of the time, and perhaps are the best writer at our time. One cute story about this is that when they first met a Tesla, a recalled that when he was 14 years old, he had been quite sick and his parents had given him some mark Twain's novels, at least according to Tesla. He told Mark Twain this, that you saved my life because I got through this sickness. And then Tesla said, commented upon Twain. He said, this great man of laughter broke out into tears. I just thought that was so cute. Um, so the two of them were, you know, a pair. But I think this relationship that Tesla had with both Robert and Catherine, um, reveal sort of a jovial and relaxed sign to this usually intense, um, in venture. They exchanged almost daily notes. They were talking about their health, the writings of other scientists, Tesla's latest inventions, um, the state of the Johnson kids.

Speaker 1:          17:17          Um, just to give you one sense of one letter, when Tesla had had a cold for a little while, uh, Robert wrote to him and he said, it's been a whole week since we saw you, and you need cheering up, coming as early as possible and get cheered. We're in a jolly mood and the fire is light and on the heart and we only need you. So here's this unbelievably intense inventor who really love to spend most of his time by himself in his lab. He was human charmingly so would be my observation. He never married. He did fall in love once with a woman. Not that I never found out. Her last name is Ana, a supposedly beautiful eyes. And the two of them, when he was 23 years old, they would walk through, you know, Austrian parks and you know, plan how they were going to have a big family and um, he was going to go off to engineering school.

Speaker 1:          18:11          That did not happen. He went off to engineering school. The relationship did not pursue, but he later would admit that inventors are not to be intimate. That was sort of his conclusion. He said, you know, you can be a musician, you can be an artist, you can be all these sorts of things, but if you're an inventor, you're too intense. And if you become married, that will take away from the intensity and focus that you need to have. And there was one sad note near the end of his life and he says, yeah, that may be true, but it also makes those lonely. Um, so this very human scientist, um, I think also give us lessons about the role and the example of being a discover. And in inventor he reveled most in the excitement of discovery. Um, I just have a few pictures of him going, you know, sort of going through his life.

Speaker 1:          19:13          He would say, I do not think there is any thrill that can go through the human heart like that felt by the inventor as he see some creation of the brain unfolding to success. Such emotions make a man forget food, sleep, friends love everything. So where did this come from? Where did this inventing spirit come from? Some has to be just a Nate. The guy was bright. I mean he could speak eight languages fluently. He could recite lengthy poems and stories just from memory. He also had a father who was a Serbian Orthodox priest who gave him mental exercises. He had to remember sequences of numbers. He had to, you know, recite longs, um, stories and sort of the list goes on. Um, he also, um, was a little strange. Um, this man who was born during a midnight lightening storm, uh, when he was young, used to have strobing light flashes in his brain that led him to admit that sometimes he couldn't tell the difference between reality and something that was fake.

Speaker 1:          20:21          It also sort of led him to go off on journeys, mental journeys, you know, so we had daytime and nighttime sort of dreams where he would travel around the world to new lands, meet new people who were almost, you know, real friends, you know, to him. So where did it come from? Exercise, natural brilliance, that a little bit of strangeness I think, but that's probably true of all of us. Not that yours truly has a genius, but it, it is that combination. He however, had a particular type of invention that I think is somewhat missing today. Um, and that's unfortunate. His was a curiosity driven quest for discovery or for reinvention. And it was motivated by idealism. And this is in contrast to Thomas Edison who basically invented because he was an entrepreneur and you want it to make money and nothing wrong with that. But Tesla, although he certainly enjoyed his fancy dinners at the DELMONICO's and he had a nice apartment at the Waldorf Astoria, but he said the technology transcended the marketplace.

Speaker 1:          21:28          That invention should not just be tied to profits. He wrote the desire that guides me in all I do is the desire to harness the forces of nature to the service of mankind. So what does this teach us? Um, if you will, about his inventing style that we might utilize, uh, today. Um, one observation, two one is that he firmly demonstrated the link between a love of humanities and the love of science. Um, he loved poetry, would recite it at length, was deeply into, as I said, foreign languages and foreign literature, et Cetera. Uh, and to give you an example, he envisioned his revolutionary electric motor. The make, the thing that made the electricity industry possible. He envisioned it. While walking through a Budapest Park, quoting goodness Faust and then he picked up a stick and drew a little design of it in the CNT. It's this mix of humanities and science that I think we are somewhat missing.

Speaker 1:          22:39          Uh, today we separate them more than I guess Tesla would argue as necessary. The other observation and sort of my final one is that, um, he would observe, I think, um, that we have moved too far away from the individualization of the inventor or the discover. We now do things with teams, and this is not a knock at all on teams, but a lot of inventing, as you probably know, you have your own teams here. Um, there are teams, you know, at universities, research centers, you know, corporate laboratories, et Cetera, and they worked marvelously. But what's missing, um, he would argue is that sometimes you just need the isolated individual who's free enough to go out there and be stupid and I'm alone. That's not to say it. See, he needed to balance, again, this envisioning individualized and venting with some reality. And he did that largely because he had at least for a brief period of his life, a lawyer who kept him in check and he needed that.

Speaker 1:          23:45          So I mean, it's not like you just have some individual Wacko out there just thinking about the future. You do need a team if you will, but he would argue you don't need as big of teams as we currently mostly focused on. I don't know if that's true. I'd welcome your insights on that one. But that would be my guess of what he would, um, come out. This he, Mike, my final comment is that I think he aimed high heat, perhaps higher than any other inventor. Um, just a few more shots of him. He worked tirelessly to bring electric power freely to the world and he built robots that he thought would reduce life's drudgery. He was in short of driven by inner forces that made sheer creation the most important thing in his life. And we are the better for it. Thank you very much.

Speaker 1:          24:40          I hope you enjoy rom reading about this mastermind. Um, and, um, I also hope that, uh, you help give him more of the due recognition that at least I and your boss thinks that he deserves. So I'm happy to take a few questions. Um, there are books that are available for all the people that are here, but let's unwelcome some questions and some dialogue where you want to know or what do you know? I'll start off with one. Oh, good. How did he end up, what's the, what's the end of the story? Um, he ended up, uh, pouring alone, um, and then, um, lift his final days. I'm sort of isolated, um, and the hotel New Yorker Morgan who refuse to see anyone and would restrict the maids and others from actually spending much time with them and just throws, shoving his grool, uh, to him. And the only reason that he even had enough money, um, at the end was because some sciences out the Westinghouse Corporation, which he essentially made possible because he formed this partnership with George Westinghouse to do the Niagara Falls project.

Speaker 1:          25:54          And so Westinghouse bought initially his patents for his electric motor. Um, but at the end it was a few scientists at the Westinghouse Corporation that convinced the corporation that it was an embarrassment to their company, that he had just declared bankruptcy and they needed to give him enough of a stipend so that at least he could survive. Now that said he died, I forget the room number in the hotel New Yorker, but it was divisible by very good of a, and more than 2000 people then attended his funeral service at the Cathedral of Saint John The divine in New York study by Columbia University.

Speaker 2:          26:37          Thank you so much for coming today. It's really nice to see someone speak without a teleprompter here at Google. Most people use it, but it's nice when it's natural. Um, so my question is, you know, you, you told this story about when he was born, um, how much do you think someone's success is based on what they believe they can do throughout their life? Mm. Um, versus their natural born, you know, intelligence.

Speaker 1:          27:08          Well, this is a tough one for Nicola. Um, yeah, and this is probably a longer answer than you wanted, but his life, um, his early life, I'm until he was about seven years old, was blissful. You two older sisters that doted on him, lived on a farm, having a great time. But when he was seven years old, his older brother Dane who was done I think 12 or 13, and he was Nicholas idle and was the family favorite, was considered gifted beyond all means. And he would follow his father into the priesthood. Unfortunately, the families, fam, um, white stallion, uh, Bolton and through his brother to the ground and he died that night from his injuries and Nicola, their witness. This, I mean, so this was a real changing event in his life. Where this comes back to your comment is that you would think his parents would then say, oh, we've got our remaining son.

Speaker 1:          28:00          Let's focus on him. But no, his mom and dad are thinking, oh, if only Dane had lived, he would have been great. Think of thing, amazing accomplishments that he would have hand. So Nicola claims that he grew up without any sense of confidence because anything he did that was noteworthy, his parents would think, oh, Dane might've done it better. So he, he had this constant struggle to find his father's affection. Um, and it never came. Um, in fact, he, this was far more than your question, don't want wanted, but I mean, he ended up finally getting his father to allow him to go to engineering school and he did it for two years and got stellar marks. But you know, whenever we got stellar marks, his father was still, oh Dane could have been better. And so he drops out of school, Nikola Tesla drops out of school, take some gambling and billiards, um, move secretly to a town like 200 miles away, gets arrested for vagrancy and is brought back by the police to his parents.

Speaker 1:          29:04          You can imagine they're not exactly happy. And I'm not suggesting this as the model for going to, you know, Google, you know, tenure, but, and his father died not long after that, just from the shock. So I don't know that, I mean, he's not an example of someone who was told all your life, you are the greatest. He was told that he was not the greatest, and yet he persevered. And in part he persevered in response to his father trying to get his father's attention. Um, you know, and he said that he went through the strobing intense light, um, dreams that he had were in part sort of a response to, you know, this father figure. But no, he did not grow up with confidence. Um, it was actually quite the opposite.

Speaker 3:          29:47          Tesla, and as we were discussing as a bit of a cult figure in odd ways and actually turns up in popular culture, um, he's, uh, shows up in some movies and some like a historical fashion. What's your, what's your take on that? How w

Speaker 1:          30:06          the thing that amazes me is that as I wrote this book, um, my publicist, um, posted a small excerpt of it on a Nikola Tesla club. Um, I think it was based in Chicago. And then suddenly the Nikola Tesla Club in Toronto picked it up and then there was a Nikola Tesla Club in Minneapolis. There are hundreds of these things and they're fervent, um, followers of the man. I mean, so the dialogue that goes back and forth on, um, you know, whether what I wrote was halfway true, where there new theory of some conspiracy there was associated with, you know, his final days and whether he in fact did do a death beam and the CIA has, you know, has um, you know, squashed it. Um, I mean, so yes, he has a cult following, um, in the movie. I mean, the perfect person played him in one, uh, movie. David Bowie.

Speaker 1:          31:03          Is that not great? I mean, David Bowie and Nikola Tesla, um, so, and, and yes, they were not exactly accurate in their depictions. They had this one scene where Tesla's one dream was that he was going to send electricity into the earth, the burst of the lightening artificial lightening, if you will, into the earth and take advantage of what he felt was the earth's natural electrical charge. And also take advantage of resonance or an echo of force so that he can have this charge go throughout the planet and people could basically, you know, plug something into the earth and have free power essentially. Well, in this movie it's really quite great. I mean, the, the, the stars are out there. They're screwing a light bulbs. I like hundreds of them across this field. Um, that did not happen. Okay. But he has, he does have indeed a cult following.

Speaker 1:          32:00          And I think, you know, I, I think it's fair because I think it's impart, um, he hasn't received the recognition that, um, say Edison or Morricone have an, this is not any knock on, on those great inventors, but, um, you know, the New York Times in their obituary basically said that it was Tesla who was the inventor of radio when I was Tesla who brought us the electric motor and electricity transmission. And I don't think most people recognize that and give him his dues. So, um, if that necessitates also having kind of the weirdness involved. Okay. What other questions? What else? Yeah, please.

Speaker 4:          32:45          Hi. So I was really curious about you saying that he died poor and he's like this great inventor and I wanted to know what you owe. I mean, what did he feel about being rewarded, at least monetarily forward this passion that he had. Um, and also you, yourself as an item, writers in general, also things such hard workers and not being remunerated.

Speaker 1:          33:07          Oh, is that the truth? Um, I'm not exactly answering your question, but let me, let me try an angle and you can tell me if I got there. He actually could have been amazingly wealthy. I mean, when he sold his electric motor patterns to George Westinghouse, he was living high on the hog. As I said, he was eating his meals at Delmonico's every night. Foyerman Yawn. You know, he lived in a large apartment at the Waldorf historian, probably the best hotel in New York City. Oh, he got tons of money. But Westinghouse, um, in large part because JP Morgan, the banker who was not exactly a nice man, he wasn't, um, you know, tried to squeeze out George Westinghouse, um, not long after the Niagara Project, which is, you know, they obviously spend a lot of money to make this happen. And so there were a little cash short and the economy is sort of just does it cycles. And this was in one of the cycles. So Westinghouse was in not great shape and JP Morgan basically tried to squeeze them out and said, you know, um, I'm gonna you either cut expenses immensely or you know, you give your company that me and I'll create the total electricity trust just like what he did with the steel industry. So Westinghouse goes to a Tesla and says, I'm in a real jam here. You know, I'm about to lose my company and you have this royalty, $2 and 50 cents per horsepower of motor. I can't afford it.

Speaker 1:          34:38          Tesla sitting there, he has all the cards. He asked the patent, he asked the contract and he's not a really good businessman. So he turns to George, Westinghouse. And says, Oh, you've been nice to me, will you? You're the one who will bring my electric motor to the world. I'm willing to tear up my contract. He tore up $1 billion of money that would have come his way, simply number one. I don't think it was a great business man, and he certainly was a horrible negotiator, but because he was an idealist, here was a man who was going to bring his invention, which he thought was the greatest thing in the world and not going to argue with that. Um, and for that he was willing to sacrifice an amazing amount of wealth. Um, I'm not sure if that answered your question, but I liked that story better. What the lawyer had died about a year before. I know this is what you need a lawyer are so many times you don't, but this time you did. What other questions?

Speaker 5:          35:42          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          35:42          Yes, please.

Speaker 6:          35:45          Hi, thanks very much. And I just wondering if you ran into, um, any associations of Tesla with, uh, the Boston area at all during your research? Are there is a, um, there's a Tesla AV in Medford. Overbuy Tufts and I've heard stories that he used to live over there. So

Speaker 1:          36:01          I don't know that he lived here. There is a very interesting, um, MIT connection. Um, I probably said Zach, so in his later years, um, when he was on, to be honest, a little bit senile, but also had flashes of genius, he would have birthday parties for himself and he'd invite reporters and really 50 of the major reporters from the New York Times, The New York Herald, Pi magazine, all these people would come and sit at his feet for like five hours as the great man would ramble on 90% of the time about jibberish and 10% of the time about something. Oh my God. You know. So, um, one of his visions during these birthday parties was a, um, uh, death beam, something like star wars that could zap battleships in airplanes out of the air. All right, we're talking in the early 1940s. I'm at a time when we're about to go to war and the thought of Nikola Tesla dying and he had the designs possibly for a death beam, um, did not make the Federal Bureau of Investigation all that excited about allowing his papers to go anywhere in the world.

Speaker 1:          37:16          So they hired an MIT physicist and assembled all of his papers, you know, together, um, which were huge boxes and he spent at least a week, if not a couple of weeks, oh, I'm being overseen by Naval Intelligence and federal FBI agents as he went through the documents. And there was one that he actually put the top secret clearance on because it was in his mind close enough, um, to being practical, um, that it needed to be considered to be top secret. The rest of it, he says basically the ramblings of an old man and like say that the only old, but, um, but here's, here's the critical question. Does anybody know who the MIT professor was that they hired to do this? John Trump. John Trump was a member of the National Academy of Engineering. He won the National Academy of Sciences Award. He also happens to be the uncle, the 45th president of the United States.

Speaker 5:          38:17          Okay.

Speaker 1:          38:18          How's that? And in fact, when the current president United States was running for office, he would refer to his uncle as somebody really bright. Notice that I have a lot of smart genes. I'm really bright and it's because that's my only sort Boston connection through MIT. Um, once through Mr. Trump. What other questions?

Speaker 1:          38:47          So, uh, what brought them from Australia to the u s um, he came, um, because um, he had been installing Edison phone systems in Budapest, in Paris. Um, to be honest, he had been spending most of his time thinking about electricity and in the Budapest park envisioned the, the engine. But he had done such a great job that his supervisors, um, sent him to New York to actually work with Thomas Edison himself. And um, they sent him with probably the greatest letter of recommendation that's ever been written. They said to Thomas Edison, this letter to Thomas Edison, I know of two great men. You are one of them. And this young man is the other. So they worked together actually, but they were totally different temperaments. Mean Edison was frumpy. He was crass. I mean, he was a genius. I'm not, you know, this is no knock on him. He just sort of was Tesla, you know, was this immaculate leader, um, refined cosmopolitan that spoke eight languages, new literature fluently, um, you know, and looked like he dressed like he was ready to go to the opera, you know, during the day.

Speaker 1:          40:05          Um, so the two of them just, you know, they were different sort of characters and they've argued vehemently about how to transmit power. I mean, Edison wanted to do it through direct current because he thought it was number one. His, um, and safer was his biggest argument and Tesla was far more interested in, in trying to send it long distances so that more people could take advantage of it. Um, and in fact, um, this is more than your question was, but they split, um, because, um, Edison refuse to provide the promised bonus. Um, if Tesla would increase the efficiency of one of the dynamos regenerators and Tesla had worked like three months, you know, to triple the output of this thing. Then he goes to the wizard of Menlo Park, who he still idolized at this time. And Edison basically just mocked him and said, oh, come on. That was a joke. And then, you know, to this young immigrant who is still a little sensitive or being in the United States, he says, you're such an immigrant. If you were only an American, you'd appreciate an American joke. Edison, of course, to not laugh. He pulled out his bowler hat appropriately so, and walked out and quit his job and started his own company. So that's how we got to the United States. All right. Thank you very much again. Thank you. I appreciate you guys having me and I hope you enjoy the book.
