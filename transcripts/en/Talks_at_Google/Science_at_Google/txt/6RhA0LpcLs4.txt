Speaker 1:          00:07          Hi everybody. It's a real pleasure to be here today to talk to you about, um, fecal microbiota transplants and some of the work that OpenBiome and finish up and doing a, I'm Kevin Roloffs. I'm a research scientist at finch working on microbial isolation and we are really, and I'm really excited to tell you about our mission, our shared mission to harness the power of the human microbiome. We'll just start off with a few basic facts about the human microbiome. So this is one of my favorite, uh, artistic depictions of the human micro biome. It's just like kind of shows off like the huge amount of bacteria that are covering every surface of us. Uh, and they're on your skin, they're on your teeth, they're all inside of your alimentary tract. And basically, although they cover every surface, the majority of them are in the intestine. So today, uh, I'm going to focus on the gut microbiome, which, and because that's the major site of the human microbiome.

Speaker 1:          01:08          So what it, what is this track look like? We have about seven meters of small intestine, two meters of large intestine, and about 32 meters squared of Mucosa surface for the bacteria to adhere to along this tract, uh, within the large intestine and the colon bacteria reach densities of one [inaudible] 11 to [inaudible] 12 cells per milliliter. This is one of the most dense microbial ecosystems on the, on the planet. And it's right inside of you. Uh, I need total, we think that there's about a little over about a hundred trillion bacteria per person that are residing on you and making up your microbiome, but the bacteria are not just the cells there, the genetic content thing code as well. And here at Google in particularly delighted to talk about, uh, the microbiome, which was originally coined as a word to describe the genetic content of a, of a, of a community of organisms.

Speaker 1:          02:08          Um, because actually we started learning about these biomes through sequencing their DNA. Um, and it's really the information content that I think is one of, at the forefront of understanding what the microbiome is doing. So in total, we've cataloged about 10 million genes that are present in gut bacteria. In any given person, you have about 4 million. And if you remember back from your high school biology textbooks, humans have around 20,000 genes. So the bacteria genetically outpaced us by almost 200 fold. As we started to learn over the last decade, really the research has picked up along with the advent of next generation sequencing technology. The microbiome has incredible effects on metabolism, immunity and cognition. And I just kind of labeled these three as areas where the research is pushing out the farthest. But I would challenge you to talk about areas of human physiology and wellbeing that don't touch on metabolism, immunity, and cognition.

Speaker 1:          03:07          But one fact I would like to change a set straight for the record is one of you might've heard originally that there were 10 times more bacterial cells than human cells. It's one of the favorite things that we started talking about in the microbiome space, but unfortunately this is not quite true. And some great work, uh, in 2016 counted, estimated all the cells that are present in a human and all of the cells that aren't, might be present a of bacteria and found that the ratio is much closer to one to one. And actually one of my favorite lines from this paper was that with each desiccation event, uh, you may flip the ratio to favor human cells over bacteria. So every poop matters. And really one of, one of the things I really like to think about, uh, to help visualize the diversity is come take a look at this updated tree of life from 2016.

Speaker 1:          04:02          So this was the, a great paper that came out that kind of shows off the major kingdoms, including the bacteria in the top, uh, are in blue, are red archaea and eukaryotes in green. So in that tiny tip that I've drawn a red box around, we have our animal plants and fungi. So that's an incredible, just think about it, like that's an incredible diversity already. And the distances on this tree reflect evolutionary distance. So if you, the animals, plants and fungi are very diverse, but they only occupy that tiny little space. Imagine how different all the rest of this microscopic life is from each other. It's a really hard, hard concept to imagine because you can't, they all look like single cells, but they're incredibly different in their membrane structure, their enzymes, their physiology. And so this is showing all bacteria or all life that we know about.

Speaker 1:          04:55          If you check out the right side of that tree, you'll see all those red dots indicating that we've never isolated or cultured a micro organism from major families there. But I pointed out a few members of the human gut microbiome. So in the bottom left we have very Kolai. So the gamma proteobacteria, these guys are one of the first model organisms for microbiology, easily cultured from the human gut. Uh, coming up, we have the Verruca Microbia, which contains members such as Akkermansia, Mucin, Ophelia Mucin, Ophelia for mucin lover. This guy hangs out on the Mucosa and it's a mucin specialist. Above there, we have the most numerically dominant members of the Gut microbiome, the bacteria dailies, specifically the genus bacteroidetes. These guys are less diverse, but the most abundant members of your human gut microbiome and polysaccharide utilizers. Uh, continuing on over to the right, we end up into the grand positives.

Speaker 1:          05:52          It's just the actino bacteria. Uh, and there you have examples such as bifidobacterium, which are some of the first colonizers of the infant gut. And further to the right, the from Mickey D's, a very diverse member file family of bacteria where, which make up the most diversity of the human gut. Um, although there are less abundant than the bacteroidetes, I should also mention the bacteria are not the end of the, of um, the gut gut microbiome. You also have eukaryotes present as well as archaea and particularly the archaea methe antigens are very important for nutrients cycling in the Gut. But today we're gonna focus on the micro biome as a whole entity. And why I think it's the most, one of the most applicable analogies to it is that I'd say microbial Oregon system. And so you start off, um, unborn fetuses are sterile and at birth they're colonized either from the vaginal canal, um, or from the skin during [inaudible] section.

Speaker 1:          06:57          And so you can either, you can see that the composite, one of these little circles are that are associated with each of these life stages or compositions showing off the amount of from Mickey D's and pink, the backdoor idds in light blue, the actino bacteria and blue and proteobacteria and red and the microbial organ system undergoes development as cu develop. So as a baby, it's a nascent Oregon. It's mostly dominated by bifido bacteria. With the introduction of solid food, the bacteroidetes start showing up as your time in adolescence, you may be subject to antibiotic treatment, which will alter the composition. Um, you may also be malnourished, which can delay the development of your gut, microbial Oregon. Uh, furthermore, as well, by the time you transition through puberty and into adulthood, your microbiome stabilizes and becomes uniquely you. Each of you has a distinct microbiome that's almost as identifying or more identifying than a fingerprint.

Speaker 1:          08:00          Um, and some of the major differences we can see in the composition and adult have to do with obese versus healthy, some macro differences. And then finally, as you become elderly, the diversity of your microbiome starts to decline. And we're not quite sure what the effects of that are, but people are looking into it. And it may have, we may be able to help ameliorate some of the effects of old age through restoring microbiome since a microbial Oregon and similar to your other organs. It structured both by your environment and your inheritance. So here I've just shown off, I've talked about a few of the features that impact the structure from the environment, but others, uh, particularly at the infant are [inaudible] versus at vaginal antibiotic exposure, breast milk versus formula feeding. There's particular milk oligosaccharides in mother's milk, which only bacteria can digest. And some of the milk, a formula providers are starting to try to try to put these sugars into their milk formulas now, but they'd been missing in the past.

Speaker 1:          09:03          Um, there's also additional factors such as BMI or weight gain during pregnancy. And the results of all of these in, and I mentioned to you also, you get an initially colonize from your mother. The results of this inheritance and environmental factors produce distinct a gut microbiome compositions in different populations. So shown on the right is a principal component analysis showing different gut microbiome compositions from United States, adults, Malawi and adults or Amerindians. And here you can see that the u s population is distinct from the Malawian and Amerindian despite having multiple, everyone having a unique gut composition are, we have a lot of functional redundancy. So shown on the left is the composition by Fila with the backdoor ids and blue and then for making, using green and proteobacteria in yellow. And these are just a adults from the human gut microbiome project. And you can see that there's like people who are dominated by backdoor ADTs.

Speaker 1:          10:09          There's some that have a balance of from Mickey D's and backdoor idds. But despite these differences in composition, all of them have almost the exact same functional genes present in their gut microbiome. So when I think about this, I think about it as maybe two different junkyards. One of tractors and one of cars, uh, but both have the functional wheels and engines is an analogy I like to use here. One of the things that really got me into gut microbiome research was even through my graduate for a hundred over a hundred years since snow and cholera, uh, the bacteria have been seen as a problem, a disease causing vectors that are just, uh, harmful to humans. And that's really catalyze a lot of research into bacteria. But it leaves people with the impression that bacteria are bad. And one of the great things about the microbiome is it demonstrates that not all bacteria are bad.

Speaker 1:          11:09          Many of them are commensals. They just live on us and they don't really do much. They don't interact with as much, and some of them are even beneficial. And we established these symbiotic interactions between beneficial bacteria and ourselves. So we have our cast of characters like salad, Gutchen, Manila, uh, that's when you've eaten the potato salad that set out too long and others. And so what's the secret? Why can we coexist with all these bacteria, many of which could be harmful to us. And I think the answer comes from, uh, that from a poem by Robert Frost, that good friend fences make good neighbors. And so here you see two neighbors making a wall together and they talk about in the poem talks about how building this wall helps encourage friendly behaviors even though it's sending up a barrier between them. And so similarly, there's a wall in the gut microbiome shown here is one of the most fascinating images I think have been produced of the human gut microbiome.

Speaker 1:          12:13          Actually, I should say this is a mouse model of the gut microbiome, but with a complex flora. Uh, the big green section is the Mucosal mucin barrier that kind of serves us a no man's land between bacteria and you. Carrots in the blue is dappy staining of Mammalian of the eukaryotic cell cells, their nuclei. And in the top left you see this huge mixture of bacteria, um, all different kinds mixed together. And you can see that the mucin is almost completely devoid of bacteria. And this even looking like a laminar structure. And you can see that one of the laminar pieces is sloughing off. And starting to be digested by the bacteria. So the host makes the mucin and it's stops the, it serves as a barrier to protect the host from constantly interacting with microbial signals, which could be harmful. I think I'll just say a little bit more about this mucin barrier cause it's just really incredible that the, uh, it's not, it's not only a physical barrier by just being too dense to enabled penetration.

Speaker 1:          13:21          It is a chemical barrier in that antimicrobial proteins and other antimicrobial particles are secreted from the host into them into the mucin and serve as a chemical determinitive microbial colonization. We've now been able to show that phages which are viruses that eat bacteria preferentially adhere to mucus and serve as little by little like, uh, I don't know what you'd call them. Uh, uh, bombs in the mucus waiting for any bacteria to come too close to them. So you have chemical, you've got phage barrier. And in addition to these, uh, antimicrobial properties, it also serves as a major source of nutrients for the bacteria. And so that mucin that's sloughing off is actually being digested and promoting. The mucin is decorated with particular sugars that promote the metabolism of beneficial bacteria. So this is just really an incredible barrier, but I think it also helps to show you that there's an incredible Mulu of bacteria that are functioning and we, they're separated from the host by this mucin.

Speaker 1:          14:26          One more picture from the same paper I mentioned that the Mucin can serve as a, as a food source. And so shown here on the left are mice that are fed a standard diet that includes polysaccharides and fiber. And then on the right is mice that are fed a diet that's deficient in fiber. And you can see that the mucin barrier in the right is dissolving. The microbes without dietary fiber are starting to eat away and penetrate further and further into the mucin. So eats your, eat your fruits and vegetables, folks for your gut, your gut microbiome. So what aspects, what's particular aspects do we know about the human gut microbiome and health? I think in 2006, it started really kicking off with, uh, Peter Turnball from Jeffrey Gordon's lab showing that you could take obese stool from humans, put it into a germ free mouse, and the mouse would develop obesity.

Speaker 1:          15:26          You could take stool from a lean human, colonize a mouse with it, and then that mouse would remain lean, suggesting that there was a BCA, obesity associated gut microbiome. And we've went on to find more things about the gut microbiome. 2008 Sarkis Mazmanian showed that there was a microbial symbiosis factor, a polysaccharide that was produced by one of those beneficial bacteria that was highly anti-inflammatory and would prevent a audit. Inflammatory diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease. We found that some bacteria can outcompete pathogens such as bifidobacteria. We find that, as I said, the gut microbiome develops and if you're malnourished, it doesn't develop. And in fact, when the, you've go to malnourished children, uh, in Malawian and you try to give them ready to eat foods like peanut butter, they don't get better. You need to repair their microbiome before they can. The food will allow them to become not malnourished.

Speaker 1:          16:26          There's also more recently, uh, we've known that microbiome is converting, um, chemicals that are derived from red meat into their Metabo. The microbes are metabolizing them into a chemical called Tmao that promotes heart as thorough sclerosis, otherwise known as heart disease. And finally, there's some great work going on also in the Mazmanian lab by Elaine Zau demonstrating that some of the Microbiota differences you can observe in mice lead to neurodevelopmental disorders. And so this is an autism spectrum, just um, a model in mice and fire. And additionally, I think we're also finding type one diabetes and other inflammatory autoimmune disorder. So you can see that this hasn't happened to deal with metabolism, immunity, cognition. One of the diseases we know about the most in the microbiome is clostridium difficile. C difficile is a hospital acquired infection that we heard about. It can, it can kill about 30,000 Americans a year.

Speaker 1:          17:30          It costs $5 billion in hospital costs and it's been rising, although I think actually do open biomes work. It's been falling lately with c difficile. You can take antibiotics, but it's a spore forming organism. So even if you are able to remove the vegetative cells, the spores are antibiotic resistant and they can remain in the gut and then germinate again. And so antibiotics have some efficacy but they don't cure. So about 30% of the time there'll be effective in curing cedar for seal. And the way this is working, I think I'll just explain this little diagram here. I think this is a really appropriate model for fecal microbiota transplant. You start with a healthy microbiome, which can be perturbed by antibiotics, which we need to take because some of these bacteria or pathogens and they'll kill you. So you need antibiotics. Let's not make any mistakes about that.

Speaker 1:          18:22          But as you're doing that, antibiotics are like nuclear bomb shells on the microbial world. They're just killing everything and hopefully, and most times the bacteria are able to grow back and restore a healthy microbiome. But sometimes you, with this clear cutting of the, of the microbial eco ecosystem, you can get a, we'd like c difficile infecting and overgrowing and preventing return to a normal healthy microbiome. And this can lead to more antibiotic treatment to cut, to get rid of the infection, which is causing horrible diarrhea. Uh, but then that leads right back into another round of c difficile disease. And so one of the most effective treatments you can do is take a whole fecal microbiota transplant, put it into a person, and just restore the healthy ecosystem. And that actually has about a 98 around a 90% cure rate for CDF. It's an incredible improvement over antibiotics.

Speaker 1:          19:20          So, but one of the problems is access, cause that's, you mentioned FMT used to be pretty sketchy. People would get blenders and give each other a transplants by having the roommate poop into a blender, grind it up and then like give themselves an enema. That's not a very safe way to do fecal transplants. But I'm showing here a picture of Mark Smith and James Burgess, the cofounders of OpenBiome. Mark had a friend who was suffering from c-diff and he just did not have access to a clinician who could provide a fecal transplant. The clinicians are worried about, uh, whether it's safe, they don't know how to do it. Um, but mark was working on this in the lab and he knew that FMTs could help his friend, but he just couldn't get them from anywhere. So with James, they decided to make open biome to provide access to FMT using a universal donor model.

Speaker 1:          20:12          So the universal donor model, what is that? That's the model where instead of trying to find one specific person who's maybe you live with so that you'd have a similar gut microbiome and trying to screw, make sure that they don't have any infectious diseases that you could get and screening that one person individually and then trying to get a fecal transplant done. Instead, what you do is use open up a stool bank, a you taking use heavily screened donors and you enable everyone to provide, uh, enable very healthy donors to provide stool that can then be given to clinicians, should just be used as a treatment instead of relying on the clinician's knowing about how to do the screening and how to do the preparation. And so OpenBiome has been incredibly successful at scaling the universal donor model. It provided over 25,000 treatments in 950 hospitals and clinics and opened by owns network in all 50 states and in seven countries, including the u s and as part of this, the universal stool donor program.

Speaker 1:          21:14          That's kind of why I'm here today to help tell you about this and encourage you to become a part of this program. There's an incredible dropoff because when there's a lot of screening that's done, there's a prescreen survey in which about 66% of people pass just, um, looking at lifestyle associated conditions. There's a clinical assessment in which 84% are make it through. And then finally laboratory testing, which results in another only 47% getting through to results in a total of only 2.8% of our donors who apply, being able to be a stool donor. So this is a very tight pipeline, but it can be very effective. So I encourage you to give poop at gift pooped out Org. You can save lives, earn money, and donate your stool and make your morning routine heroic. I think one of the most exciting things that we're doing at finch and OpenBiome is looking about looking ahead to find out what new diseases might fecal transplants be effective for.

Speaker 1:          22:15          And so I'll just share with you a small vignette about alopecia. Alopecia is an autoimmune disease in which you start to lose your hair, uh, and or all hair on your body. And so shown here as a patient at 16 years old on the, on the far left starting to lose hair. Um, then this patient unfortunately also contracted c difficile and then received a fecal transplant and as a result, and so this middle picture shows him right before receiving the fecal transplant. And then after the fecal transplant, his he notices hair started to regrow. And these have now been, this one anecdote has now become two anecdotes and we're very interested in following up on it. Ask for one example, but uh, this kind of shows you how connected the gut microbiome is to our overall health and ways that we can't know today. But we're hoping to discover tomorrow. And so without a leave you by saying that we're OpenBiome and finch or focused on safe access, clinical research, perpetual access and new cures. Thank you.

Speaker 2:          23:25          Okay.

Speaker 1:          23:26          Now have some time for questions and answers and nod. Like I'll also introduce and meg, Meg Megan food. Did I mispronounce your last name horribly? Yeah. Meg Is, uh, one of our ex on our external affairs team at OpenBiome. Yeah,

Speaker 3:          23:42          we screen for a lot of different conditions. Um, and you do have to have a BMI under 30. If you want to become a stool donor.

Speaker 4:          23:51          The front, why is the, why is the pipeline so narrow that you really have to be that careful? Is that what makes it so narrow?

Speaker 3:          24:02          Why is the pipeline so narrow? What partly because there's research indicating that the gut microbiome is related to pretty much everything. Um, partly because a lot of people tend to carry conditions they don't know about. Um, when we test for still note are the people that we reject that don't make it through rather, um, aren't necessarily unhealthy. But there are people who are carrying a transmission of disease or some sort of condition that we think might harm the people with C diff. I mean, two things to remember here. One, we're regulated by the FDA, which has very, very strict standards and to the people who are getting fecal microbiota transplants are really, really sick. You know, fecal Microbiota transplants are only approved for recurrent CDI. C diff infections, not the initial C diff infection. So by the time they get to us, they've already been through at least two rounds of antibiotics, typically had this disabling diarrhea for three, four, five, six months or even longer in some cases.

Speaker 3:          24:56          So we can't take any chances that, oh, that little noro virus that you happen to carry that doesn't cause you any problems. Could could kill this person who's already in a very delicate state of health. So, um, that's why it's narrow and we can't predict who's going to make it through the pipeline or not. You know, some people are Gung Ho rowers and need a perfect fiber diet. Some people just kind of munch French fries and walk around, but they for some reason have this really great gut microbiome and aren't carrying any, anything we don't want in there is we can't predict. That's why we have to ask all of you to apply. And there,

Speaker 3:          25:34          do we have to match donor recipient? No, that's the wonderful thing. Um, as long as the person isn't carrying some sort of disease or has some sort of condition we think might make you sick or pretty much anyone will do, it's really amazing. It'll, it'll all work in C diff and it works about 90% of the time. That is not necessarily true for other conditions. Um, open biome, we have a dual mission of providing safe access to fecal microbiota transplants for c diff but also promoting clinical research. And we're currently involved in the 30 different clinical research trials looking to things like inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn's disease, even peanut allergies and one case. And there's some indication from some of our work on types of inflammatory bowel disease that there are differences between donors and their effectiveness in promoting remissions. So for seed, if it doesn't matter for other things it might, we're not sure yet, which is why we're doing all this research.

Speaker 5:          26:27          Hi, a wonderful talk. I was wondering if you could tell us anything about what either known or theorize, but the mechanisms between the gut microbiome and any of these other conditions such as obesity or the, the hair loss or either known or theorized about that, those connections.

Speaker 1:          26:44          So sometimes we're digging into specific mechanisms and sometimes it's not known. So particularly in the obesity case, it was, there was a investigation into the metallic metabolic genes and we were able to see that there is an over abundance of metabolic genes associated with energy harvest suggesting that potentially the, um, microbes are just liberating or make it so you'd have this fiber that's good, but normally it's just exclude screened. And they used us with food for the bacteria, but they may be producing metabolites which can then be absorbed by the human host, um, and that may be providing more energy from a given set of food. Um, and actually those metabolites are also potentially underlying some of the inflamed inflammation parts. So I mentioned there was a specific polysaccharide that was released by bacteroidetes, which was in anti-inflammatory, but that's a pretty specific one. One of the most general mechanisms, uh, that's well known is the production of these short chain fatty acids like butyrate at appropriate Nate, which are just small little carbons that result from the breakdown of polysaccharides. And many bacteria in the gut can release those and they serve as actually the primary food source for your colonic endothelial cells. And so not only do they help the cells, how by providing their preferred metabolite, they can also trigger a specific receptors, g of protein receptors in immune cells to have diverse effects. But the results of which are generally the production of anti inflammatory cytokines and the reprogramming of immune cells away from inflammation towards tolerance.

Speaker 3:          28:29          And people are looking at this, these immune effects of the gut microbiome in an astonishing number of conditions. There's some really interesting research coming out about the gut microbiome and multiple sclerosis and Parkinson's disease. And there a couple of really interesting papers that came out just last week about um, mediation mediating in cancer treatments and evolved immune system that some people who have certain type of Gut Microbiota chemotherapy as much more effective. And if you take their gut microbiome and put them in germ free mice, you find the same differences in the mice as you did between people when they undergo cancer treatments. So anything having to do the immune disease, it just, anything that's pretty astonishing. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          29:09          So there was a paper in nature, I believe 2014 about the effect of um, the sugar substitutes on the gut microbes and resulting hmm. Um, resulting a metabolic syndrome symptoms essentially, which could be transferred from mouse to a mouse by, by, uh, by fecal transplant. Seems like the sort of thing that we both known to you and flashy and shocking. We've been followed up by other researchers by now. What's latest in that area?

Speaker 1:          29:42          So actually no, that paper pretty well. It was fascinating because it's like one of the, these are artificial sweeteners that are supposed to be not metabolized, right? So they're supposed to be calorie free, uh, but still have sweetness. But one of the things that means by not metabolized normally sugars are like digested and the simple ones are dissolved almost out of your mouth. Like, and if not by then in at least in the, um, in the small intestine. Uh, but these ones make, are not, and they make their way straight down into the gut microbiome, the colon. And there they were shown to have an effect on promoting a signaling that would lead to like metabolic disorder in mice. There's, I haven't seen that. There's been new updates on that story. Um, I think one of the caveats there is that they were, I tried to calculate how much artificial sweetener they were feeding the mice.

Speaker 1:          30:37          And I think it was somewhere around like if you were a human, you need to have like 70 packages of, uh, ah, which one was it? I won't, I won't say which one so I don't get in trouble. But like one, whichever one it was, didn't need to open 70 packets. I need that much to get the same dosing that was being applied to the month mouse. Um, also the other interesting part is they didn't just feed it to the mice. They took the bacteria out and they dosed the bacteria, grew it with this artificial sweetener as the sole nutrient source for awhile and then they transplanted it back. And then the community had these different signaling effect soon as a few caveats there, but it definitely hinted that these artificial sweeteners may not, while they may be calorically in are they may have a strong signaling effect mediated by the microbiome.

Speaker 3:          31:27          Fun fact about mouse experiments in the microbiome. Mice do their own fecal transplants if they want us together, much like dogs do sometimes. There was another question in front

Speaker 3:          31:41          research and irritable bowel syndrome. We certainly are. If you're interested in any clinical trials of fecal microbiota transplants, clinical trials.gov, uh, you can put in on the search term, your condition and then FMT or fecal microbiota transplant or just fecal and you'll come up with list of trials. I know there are a couple of running in Boston, probably Doctor Jessica Allegretti ready at Brigham and women's, but don't quote me on that. Um, look it up on clinical trials.gov. Any other questions? Could you speak more as to what you're looking for in the pipeline that you mentioned earlier?

Speaker 1:          32:15          Uh, so in each of these stages, I think they're, I mean, maybe you might be the right person for through this. Yeah,

Speaker 3:          32:23          like on a regular basis.

Speaker 1:          32:25          The donor survey has a variety of questions about lifestyle risk. So maybe are you monogamous? Um,

Speaker 3:          32:33          no, no, no, no.

Speaker 1:          32:34          Oh, okay.

Speaker 3:          32:38          Honestly, um,

Speaker 1:          32:40          they've updated it. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          32:41          We really want to know that you live in Boston or Cambridge or somewhere around here. First of all, because we get a lot of people applying and say, this is cool. I live in Paraguay. I'm like, no, you cannot send us your poop in the mail. Don't even think about it. So that's, that's her primary criterion. Can you actually get to one of our donor sites and we have donor sites at inner belt road in Somerville and your Sullivan Square Station and one in central square. Very convenient to Google headquarters and another one at Bu West if you're on that side of the river. Um, and they're open every day of the week. Um, and they're very convenient and they're staffed by friendly people. Um, you know, we're looking to see are healthy. Um, if you have a history of colitis or inflammatory bowel disease, this isn't what you should be doing.

Speaker 3:          33:22          Um, but overall it's, it's about health. And again, there are things that you may be carrying. A lot of people carry parasites without knowing it, you know, hominids or something like that. And you can't tell that until you got to the end of the clinical interview and gone through blood and stool screening because he wa you wouldn't ask your doctor, you know, he wouldn't say, Hey, can you just test me for parasites? You have no reason to suspect, but again, you could be carrying something that could make someone very sick. Um, we test for more than 30 different conditions and we have a rather lengthy questionnaire that people go through before they even go to the nurse. So it's hard for me to summer as as it right now. And, um, but if you're curious, go to give poop.org register and we will probably point you to a copy of the questionnaire and you can see for yourself other questions,

Speaker 6:          34:11          uh, that just prompted one. When you say you do all the testing, do you give the results to the donor or is that just used internally?

Speaker 3:          34:19          If we abide by HIPPA regulations and if we find anything new about your health that you do not tell us about. Like if we get the stool and blood sample back and say, Hey, wait a minute, this person is positive for HIV for example, we certainly tell you. But, um, if it just comes back that it's something he said, oh by the way, I got hepatitis last year and you come back positive for hepatitis, we would call you. Um, but generally we don't find anything new. Most people, um, are excluded from donation, not because of anything new, but because of something that could affect the people who are getting the transplants, like having a family history of colitis.

Speaker 6:          34:55          Yeah, I came in late and missed the talk. So I'm going to ask a question, which might have been the last, what assays do you perform on the samples? Genetic essays, sequencing such,

Speaker 1:          35:08          yeah, that's a great question. So as I mentioned, the reason we start to know so much about the gut microbiome is because of next generation sequencing technology. And so particularly the two types of sequences, we generally perform our 16 s amplicon sequencing. So here every bacteria has a specific gene. It was called the 16 s ribosomal RNA gene. And here, because each one of them has it, you can use it as a marker for how they're related to each other. And that can give you an overall picture of the community, but it doesn't get a high enough resolution because everyone has it. It doesn't change fast enough to really let you get down into the species much less the strains. So bacteria with identical 16 s gene sequences could have up to like 20 to 30% of their genome will be different. So the other type of sequencing we do is called shotgun and Meta genomics. And here instead of starting with a PCR preliminary chain reaction to target a specific gene, you just look at every single piece of DNA that you can find and start sequencing it. And that gives you a piece here, a piece there, uh, and they're hard. It's much more computationally difficult to understand the results of shotgun sequencing, but it's can get you down into the strain level composition of the gut microbiome.

Speaker 6:          36:30          I'll follow up and ask exactly what do you do a assembly technology do you use to try and ask say these shotgun sequences? I used store the bloat institute across the street as a building genome assembly tool. So that's my interest.

Speaker 1:          36:48          Yeah. Unfortunately, I don't think I can say much about that for two reasons. One, I'm mostly on the microbial isolation side. Uh, I'm really hoping to improve my computational skills, but I just couldn't speak confidently about the different pipelines that are being used right now, uh, by our data science team. Um, I'd happy to be put in touch with sunny at Timberlake who is our director of data science. It could maybe say some more about that. Thank you very much. Thank you.
