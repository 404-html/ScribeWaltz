Speaker 1:          00:00:10       Get cleo. Thank you Keith. Justin, everybody has been instrumental in getting the out here up from sunny southern California in San Diego. That's a true pleasure to be here. And I'm interested in sharing some ideas with you that I've had for a couple of years now, but really came into sharp focus just just about, uh, three or four years ago when we made a discovery that made front page headlines around the world and it was done in such a way as to captivate the attention of people, young and old, uh, you know, of all, all different, all different nationalities because what it spoke to was how did the universe come to be the way that we see it today? And I'm going to talk to you about that and the concomitant intertwining with this most prestigious of all accolades on earth, namely the Nobel prize. And I came to encounter it and obviously, you know, spoiler alert, I did not win the Nobel prize.

Speaker 1:          00:01:02       This is not real, this one over here. Uh, but it's edible or not. Sometimes you know, sometimes that's even more preferable. You want to talk to you about how we came to make this discovery and sort of the summary of the book can be shown and, and just one, one picture, as most things can be described, there's a picture made in nature magazine and on the occasion of my a book release and it shows a telescope are our neighbor telescope at the South Pole staring up to the heavens and fixated and focused in some sense on the Nobel prize. That's a picture of our, uh, the famous Nobel prize rendered as if it is the s this type of heat that I studied that I will talk to you about today called the cosmic microwave background radiation, the oldest light in the universe. But before we get into the pursuit of the Nobel Prize and the ultimate, uh, uh, the loss of, of winning Alfred's namesake medallion, I want to explore a little bit of how the Nobel Prize came to be so venerated, so esteemed that it really dominates headlines around the world.

Speaker 1:          00:01:57       And I can't really, you know, thank the media enough because right now the Nobel prize and our fearless leader, Donald Trump, our air are in the news almost on an hourly basis. So we'll, we'll get to that towards the very end when I talk about some ideas that I'm proposing my book and arguments I make for a modification to a society's superlative prize. So how did the Nobel prize get to be so esteem? Well, first, a brief history of the Nobel prize. So the history is that Alfred Nobel, his family and his father were great inventors and they were inventors of deadly technologies in particular. They invented landmines and see mines, uh, during the, uh, one of the Russian wars in the mid 18 hundreds. Uh, at some point czar Nicholas decided that they were done with war in Russia. And you know, that came to be true, right?

Speaker 1:          00:02:42       There are no more wars. The Russia after the 1860s. Right? So, but they cut all the ties to the Nobel F and F and son's business, which we're making these deadly munitions. And that kind of drove the older, the father, elder Nobel Emmanuel Nobel crazy. And he ended up seating control of his business. His to his oldest son, Ludvig. In between there was a huge boom, a building boom in the west in particular in the United States. We were building railways, expanding them from the east coast to the west coast. And at that time they needed to do, they needed some way of mass excavation and they were using Nitroglycerin, which is incredibly unstable. And in fact, if you take nitroglycerin and you drop it, it will explode. And actually happened to Alfred's baby brother a meal. So Alford's a baby brother Emil was trying to synthesize a stable version of nitroglycerin.

Speaker 1:          00:03:29       He failed miserably. Unfortunately, he died as well as three of his lab mates. So, you know, I use that as a cautionary tale in my lab all the time. And just three years later, Alfred invented dynamite. And I'll talk about that in the next slide. But dynamite was a real revolution because it was stabilized. It was actually made of completely edible ingredients. Nitroglycerin, which Alfred himself would take for angina. And, uh, and, and things like chalk and anti acids and things like that. But when combined in just the right proportion, as many inventions of that you guys are familiar with, then you get the secret. You get the secret sauce that really made Alfred one of the richest people in the world. Then an 1888 Alfred was walking around in Paris where he would soon be exiled for, for a siding with the enemy of France, namely Italy, and building them war munitions.

Speaker 1:          00:04:16       And he was walking down the street. So I headline and the headline said, the merchant of death, Alfred Nobel is dead. And there was like a celebratory obituary, if you can imagine that. Very obstreperous. So he, he saw this headline and he realized, hmm, you know, I'm very much alive. You know, the reports of my demise are a little bit exaggerated, but it was actually his older brother Ludvig the one who had received control, the business of Nobel and sons from his father. So Alfred read that and actually it, he treated it as a great gift because he realized that if he didn't change his ways, that the way the newspaper described him as the merchant of death, the person responsible for more deaths in human history than any other person, that would be the legacy that he would be remembered by. So he resolved then to change this.

Speaker 1:          00:04:58       And he really, and my sense, he endowed the Nobel prize a few years later in an attempt, I think at public relations and it was wildly successful. So if you go to Google, patents are patents.google. You'll find, uh, an invention list of 355 inventions. The most profitable was dynamite. Dynamite outfit. Nobel. Actually, he did some ab testing on Google adwords back then and he was going to originally call it Nobel's safety powder. You know, it was like a euphemism because he wanted to, people knew that Nitroglycerin was very, uh, you know, have this connotation of being deadly. In fact, when people at the drug store would have to buy nitroglycerin 18 hundreds, they wouldn't ask for it. They call it, they made up a name for our called trying to train or something like that. And that was done to not scare the chemist or the pharmacist. So he made this a substance later the, the a choice and the Ab testing dynamite one and it means power rock.

Speaker 1:          00:05:50       And there's some pictures of what it looked like. And uh, this made him one of the wealthiest people in the world at that time. With that money, he endowed this Medallian, this prize that bears his name. He indict endowed five prizes and peace, chemistry, literature, medicine or physiology, and my field of physics. And what was so interesting to me is to, as I'll show you later on in the pro in this talk, not only did I personally lose the Nobel prize, but I was asked to nominate the winners of the Nobel prize the very next year after I lost it. Okay. It's kind of bittersweet and uh, and it, and it actually led me to this voyage of exploration and hopefully a reformation for humanities superlative prize. So this prize was endowed by Alfred Nobel's will, and he wrote it down by hand. And the prize was, uh, was, was, it was, it was so important to him.

Speaker 1:          00:06:41       He specified exactly what he wanted to happen and what would be, uh, the, the ultimate aim of this prize. And I'll explain what he wanted as we go on. But the first thing I want to say is that, um, this story involves, uh, if you, if you will, the villain in my book is, uh, is this very humble substance called dust. And I have, I'm blessed to have five children now. I'm very familiar with dust, uh, but it's a different kind of dust. But, but it made me think back when, when you'll see the encounter that I'll describe scientifically in this book between dust and me and my experiment, it made me think of the biblical verse that goes ashes to ashes, dust to dust. So it means that humanity, humans start off their life, basically is nothing but dust. And then we end, our ultimate aim of everybody is dust.

Speaker 1:          00:07:24       And so poetically. I thought, well that's kind of interesting because the history of astronomy also begins in some sense with dust and start us, literally flows through our veins right now. The iron in the hemoglobin in your blood was once and the core of a supernova that exploded and repopulated the universe, the cosmos in our local solar neighborhood with heavy elements and those heavy elements eventually coalesced and made their way into your bloodstream. So dust is a villain in some sense in this book as you'll find out. But we're not the only ones who have been bedeviled by dust devils in the cosmos. The first one was the first astronomer and history to use a telescope. Galileo Galilei, there's a sketch of his telescope and he, of course, there's a sketch of his telescope. He used his telescope to make discoveries that were impossible to make with the human eye unaided.

Speaker 1:          00:08:09       And this telescope, this tiny little thing that you can get a, I'm not at a bookstore sometimes on a bookstore, I'm forbidden to use a certain online retailer that starts with a and a so. So I said, nowadays you can buy a telescope online on Google shopping.google. Right? And it costs less than some apps that you guys probably make. Okay. So this is something that if you have a child in your life, even here in Los Angeles or the bay area or wherever, you can see the same exact sites that Galileo saw. And what did he see? Some of it is depicted here. Those are his sketches. Some of the first, what I call stop motion animation of what the moons of Jupiter were doing. So these are the orbits is a Pr, a plot that he made in the early part of 1610 of what the planet Jupiter look like through his telescope.

Speaker 1:          00:08:52       Tiny little thing. And he saw that there were these stars and he called these stars the muddied she satellites. So he named the the, the satellites after his patrons, after his benefactors, the Medici family of, of northern Italy. And you see also he made depictions of the planet Venus and saw that it had this strange behavior where it would change its phase, its shape, it would look like a miniature moon with Crescent, and then, uh, give us phase and the moon. And Saturn appeared as if he had these weird pitcher like ears on it. And then you see the sketches of the moon on the, uh, on the upper right as well. So what Galileo did was so titanic, because he overthrew the paradigm and that the Earth was the sole center of the universe. So back then they considered the solar system to be the entire universe.

Speaker 1:          00:09:34       And the Earth was the center of the solar system. So therefore the earth was the center of this or the, of the entire universe. What they didn't know until Galileo used the telescope was that there were other centers of the solar system. So it could not be unique that the earth is the center of the solar system. If there's another center, namely the planet Jupiter. So Galileo didn't as, as people often misconstrue what Galileo did, he didn't prove the Copernican hypothesis. He didn't prove that the sun is the center of the, uh, of the, uh, universe. He's just disproved that the earth is the only center of the universe. Because I was an important, you know, if overly belabored I'm an academician. Okay, so forgive me, but I claim, you know, as brilliant as he was, he made some blunders and he made many blunders and they were done in a service to further confirm the Copernican hypothesis.

Speaker 1:          00:10:21       He went to his grave as you, as you may know, uh, for basically committing the crime of heresy, suggesting that the earth was not the center of the universe. And in part of that, he never really recanted this decision that he believes so strongly in that he was, uh, basically unwilling to part with. But not only that, he used every piece of evidence that he had in physics and in astronomy to try to bolster his argument. And it's a phenomenon known as confirmation bias. And we as human beings and scientists, as you guys know, are also human beings despite the stereotypes to the contrary. But this little asterisk them. Does anyone know what this aster ism is? Maybe some of you drive one of these asterisk gums. This is Subaru in Japanese. It means the seven sisters a plea, 80s, the eighties in Greek literature where the nurses of Dionysus, who was the god of the grape.

Speaker 1:          00:11:09       So he's responsible for all our wine. Uh, and they were his nurses. I Dunno how they got that. These little stars are like that. In fact, you can only see six of them with the even good eyes. Uh, but Galileo went even further with this. He looked at the constellation, there's a little asterisk and he sketched it as it appeared to his eye. And Edward Tufte, the famous, uh, uh, kind of sociologist of science or re recontour of science. He calls Galileo the world's first data scientist. So I'm sure there's a lot of data scientists here. So if you see here, Dalai was depicting the Pleiades, the seven sisters and an interesting unique fashion. He showing two different types of stars. There are open stars like stars of David was six points on them. And then there's filled in, completely closed in stars and they're totally different.

Speaker 1:          00:11:52       And I want you to for a second what those could possibly mean. I actually gave this talk to a bunch of astronomers at Caltech a couple of days ago and they couldn't understand that. Almost none of them guess what it meant. But I'll, I'll give you a second to think about it. And then, uh, we can also read what Galileo rope beneath it. He said, what we observed is the nature of the matter of Milky Way itself, which with the aid of the spyglass, which is what he called the telescope, is observed so well that it, that all the disciplines that for so many generations have vexed philosophers can be destroyed by visible certainty and we are liberated from their wordy arguments. Okay. So back then, physicists weren't great fans of philosophers, even nowadays that's, that's also held to be true. But if you're, if you're, if you haven't come up with the answer to what do these different types of iconography, what did they represent?

Speaker 1:          00:12:40       The stars that are open, these six pointed stars of Dave, those represents stars that the human eye can see on aided the stars that are black and filled in or those that he can only see with a telescope. And he said that the entire constantly, or the tire aster ism, it's technically not called the constellation, but it's a little collection of stars that the entire star collection, which is shown here through the Hubble telescope, that this can be, could be resolved into stars, even the glowing gaseous nebulosity, what we call nebulosity now, when in fact now we know that even with a much more powerful telescope, even the Hubble telescope 50 times bigger in diameter, uh, then, then Galileo's that you still can't resolve the nebulosity and to stars. And so what was it he was trying to say that the nature of the Milky Way was purely made of stars.

Speaker 1:          00:13:25       So first he demoted the, the earth from the center of the solar system. Then he said the son could be the center of the solar system. And then he said, the sun is just like any other star in the Milky Way. So it's quite interesting. Everything that he's using is done in a furtherance of the Copernican hypothesis. So it's a confirmation bias example, par exsalonce. He later went on to conjecture that the tides that we feel here on earth are caused by the rotation of the earth on its axis and also the revolution of the earth around the sun. We now know that to be completely incorrect, the tides that we feel, high tide, low tide here near the beach, are caused by the Moon's gravitational influence. But why did he want to, why do you want to say it was from the Earth's motion around the sun?

Speaker 1:          00:14:05       Because that meant that the earth went around the sun and it's completely wrong. So even the greatest intellectual physicist in history, Galileo, uh, to some of us made blunders and they were done because of what he wanted to see. And that's a theme that runs throughout cosmology to this very day. And sad to report affected us on my project called Bicep that I'll talk about. So Galileo made this blender, okay? It's not the worst blender you can make, you know, with the first telescope in human history. Uh, but you see here, one other thing to notice is that this is a nebulosity. This nebulosity is not stars. It's actually made of gas. It's made of dust, and it's made a particles that act like little mirrors. And some of them are my metallic as well. So we actually know that they twinkle in a sense because of the reflection of the star light off of tiny mirrors of dust.

Speaker 1:          00:14:52       So Galileo was deceived by dust into thinking that the sun was just a star, like any other star. And the vast assemblage of stars we call the Milky Way Galaxy. So not all that twinkle's is a diamond. So that'll be a theme throughout. So again, the Copernican model, which wasn't proven. So by the standards of mathematical proof in science, what we do is really disprove other hypotheses. So what Galileo technically did, his disprove the Ptolemaic Aristotelian ancient Greek conception of the central central position of the Earth about the cosmos. And you see the more complicated version of Copernicus and Galileo on the right. So what we're trying to do now, and what I describe in my book is since the time of Galileo, there've been four other Copernican revolutions, there've been revolutions after Galileo disabused humanity of its central purpose in central point in the universe's arrangement. The next group of astronomers promptly forgot that lesson.

Speaker 1:          00:15:48       Then the best astronomer, one of the best astronomers, the 17 hundreds named William Herschel. He made a map of the Milky Way Galaxy, and guess where he put the earth and the sun at the center of the Milky Way Galaxy, where it's actually technically not located there. The next, uh, couple of what are called great debates in my book, they were corresponding to is the Milky Way Galaxy, the center of the universe, and was our galaxy central not only in space, but in time. Is there something special about humanities, galaxy, et Cetera, in time and space. And then the question is, is our universe the only universe or is what's called the multiverse centered on us as well? That's the last of the five debates in my book. But I say there's many more of these debates to come where humanity overemphasizes it's importance and nature conspires like the ultimate big brother to say you're not that great.

Speaker 1:          00:16:36       And that's what happens. Okay. I've got a big brother and I've got three sons and I'm also a big brother so I can say that. So I want to show you guys something kind of cool cause this took place just up the road from you guys and it has a night. A nice, really cool Google connection. So in the 1960s this was the original Internet. Okay. So they launched a balloon. Some are over central Kansas and from JPL, just up the road in Pasadena, they shot radio waves that bounced off this giant metallic reflective mylar co covered balloon. And they bounced. Those signals are, they tried to bounce those signals to a receiving horn in Homedale New Jersey. So it was trans continental communication with radio waves. And so what this reminds me of nowadays is what you guys do here or do elsewhere within the, within the corporation is get Internet.

Speaker 1:          00:17:23       Okay? Except this Internet says your motto is balloon powered Internet for everyone. So that was balloon powered Internet for one communicator at a time. So if they were, you know, if, if, if someone was on the phone or using the Internet, it was much worse than dial up even. But they found they couldn't get it to work because the balloon signal decreases. Uh, sort of like the fourth power of the distance they were trying to transmit. So instead they launched a tiny little satellite into space and it was called Telstar. Now you guys, by the looks of it are way too young to remember when the first communication satellites were launched. But actually Sputnik, the very first satellite ever launched and the night late 1950s was basically a radio transmitter. And that solved a lot of the problems of the inverse square law, which kills the power, transmitted and kills the power received.

Speaker 1:          00:18:06       And so they launched a satellite into space and these astronomers, Penzias and Wilson using that same horn and 10 I used with the reflective balloon, they were using this to see if they could see the signal to noise that they needed to do real internet communications using a transceiver, a device that could receive a signals from California and the amplify them, boost them and send them down. This work fantastically well, except when they kept looking at the satellite through their telescope, they didn't get the signal to noise. They predicted and they were very diligent scientists and they tracked down all the sources of error they could find, including the fact that there was a, there was a nest of pigeons inside of this antenna that would not go away. In fact, Penzias over here. He took them in his car and drove him from northern New Jersey to Philadelphia, and guess what?

Speaker 1:          00:18:51       These are homing pigeons. So what do they do? They came back and they described it, these pigeons as leaving a white dielectric material inside the heart that they couldn't get her. They scrubbed that they cleaned it. Finally they couldn't get rid of it. So they went to to um, you know, their quarter master or whatever and they said, we need a shotgun. And they said, why? They said, we've got to kill these birds. And they did. And Penzias later recounted, he said the birds left with a little bang and then we discovered the big bang. And that's really what happened next. So they ended up making a map of the sky that they could not remove a persistent three degree Kelvin above absolute zero glow coming in all directions, which if you had microwave vision to your eyes without the aid of boosting contrast, this is what you'd see.

Speaker 1:          00:19:34       If you could see microwave's you'd go out and look around. Everything surrounding the earth would be colored in a certain sense. Constant, persistent, never changing with season or direction or anything. It's a background that comes from the big bang because they were looking back not only in space, but they were looking back in time. Nowadays we can subtract the average signal. This three Kelvin signal and some of my colleagues at, uh, NASA made an a beautiful animation of what this picture would look like if you add very high contrast. In addition to high sensitivity, you would see tiny ripples, tiny fluctuations in this pattern. So if you zoom in on this image after boosting up it's contrast, you see that it has fluctuations in temperature, the temperature is not exactly three Kelvin and some places it's three Kelvin plus 10 Microkelvin, 10 millions of a Calvin and some other places.

Speaker 1:          00:20:21       It's 10, three Kelvin minus 10. Microkelvin. That's about the size of how much it varies from point to point on the sky. And thank goodness it does vary because without those variations, the matter that makes up the stars and galaxies in our universe wouldn't know where to coagulate in a uniform universe. And it was known that this was true from the time of Laplas and Newton, that the, uh, uniformly distributed universal uniform matter throughout would never provide a nucleation site for matter to a agglomerate to create the stars, planets and galaxies that we see today. So that's a nice image there. The question is what caused those fluctuations? In the beginning, you could imagine that you could explain something if it was perfectly smooth and you can explain something that is widely, not smooth, but it's very hard to get fine tuned amounts of fluctuation.

Speaker 1:          00:21:07       So 10 microkelvin out of say, let's just call it 10 Kelvin, that's a few parts per million. It's fine tuning. Where does that smoothness come from? That's smooth but not perfectly smooth. It's actually smoother than the surface of a bowling ball. Any bowling ball smoother than my bowling ball because I'm a terrible bowler and I make big dents in it, but the surface of a bowling ball compared to its, its radius instantaneously compared to its average radius varies by about 10 times that amount. The Universe is much smoother than anything than any other, you know, naturally occurring thing that you might be familiar with. So we set out to try to understand where do those fluctuations come from. And we built a telescope called Bicep to do it. The theory underpinning why there should be fluctuations. The, the leading candidate theory is called inflation. Inflation predicts that in the extremely early universe, a trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth after the big bang that the universe underwent this strange kind of phase transition that was quantum in nature.

Speaker 1:          00:22:02       And the amount of expansion varied from point to point in space because quantum fields do that. There are rare random variables and they'll have fluctuations in them that technically are called Gaussian random fluctuations. And that could lead to enough fine tuning that you could get a universe that's smooth but not perfectly smooth. And again, without the, without the deviation from perfect smoothness, we would not be here. There'd be no way for galaxy to know where to form if you like. So we were, we were interested in trying to measure this extremely early fraction of a, of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second after the big bang. This is called inflation. It's very hard to depict something that nobody knows anything really about. And so, you know, sometimes it's just shown as a giant question mark. I don't think that's too useful. This is meant to illustrate that the universe had these quantum fluctuations throughout it and they would lead to variations which would later cause these temperature patterns to originate.

Speaker 1:          00:22:52       And that's exactly the leading candidate of the early cosmo genic theory of, of the universe. So I like to compare this to another form of evolution. So if there are some, you know, biology, uh, uh, Aficionados in the audience, you may recognize this object. This is called a blastocyst. It's a collection of human cells about a thousand seconds after your parents had their own personal big bang. This object has about a hundred or so cells and it will later evolve into somebody. But we're, we're trying to do is take an image of somebody today or the universe as it looks to us today and then extrapolate back in time to what the universe was like 50 orders of magnitude earlier in time. Here's what you look like at a thousand seconds. And imagine trying to understand what the, what this blastocyst is embryo become. What would it look like? Who has a guest?

Speaker 1:          00:23:40       Anyone have a guess at Eric Schmidt? No, nobody liked that. Okay. So I'll give you a hint. I'm going to you a hint here. I'll go put some identifying features on the blastocyst. And then of course we recognize it as my children's favorite astrophysicist. You don't know how bad that feels. Okay? And I'm care about Daddy. They care about Neil. Uh, so here's how he looks at an age of about being generous. 2 billion seconds. You want to feel old, quote your agent seconds. That's about 50, 59 years, I think he is. Um, and if you want to extrapolate back to what he was as a blastocyst, that's a factor of 2 million. We're trying to go 50 orders of magnitude, not six orders of magnitude, 50 orders of magnitude. We thought we could do it using a very special type of telescope because the Telus, if the telescope, we're sensitive, what, what's called the lights polarization, then the reverberations of spacetime produced during inflation.

Speaker 1:          00:24:31       What produced this crazy twisting curl mode pattern on the microwave sky. So in addition to the temperature fluctuations, there'd be variations in polarization. So we have Polaroids. You guys living in southern California to have to have these, they're de Rigor. These are my state university funded a solid sunglasses that I get to wear. These are sensitive to one orientation of the lights, polarization and as you rotate one versus the other one, you go from light to dark to light to dark. So it rotates twice in amplitude for every single physical rotation of these Polaroids. We did the same thing, not with optical light but with microwaves. And what we did is we claimed that there was evidence for what are called gravitational waves produced during the big bangs, inflationary epoch that shook up space time so violently that it caused these patterns to originate. And that was what we claim we discovered.

Speaker 1:          00:25:19       I'm going to talk to you about that. We use this instrument here called it bicep. I coined the term, uh, it's uh, stands for by background imager of cosmic extra galactic polarization, but it was really called that because the pattern that we're looking for these swirling, curling, twisting patterns. And I thought it was kind of cute that the Bicep, you know, you guys go down to the gym here, you work in the Bicep, that's the muscle that powers you to do curls. And I thought, well that's kind of a cute name for this. It's actually a gal lane spyglass. It's just a microwave spyglass so I brought some of our detectors here and here and what they look like, but they're sensitive to wavelengths of light of about two millimeters instead of 500 microns. Like your ion sensitive to, these are sensitive to much, much longer wave lengths where the microwave signal gets the brightest.

Speaker 1:          00:26:03       Where we observe these photons from the big bang. The lenses are made of ordinary milk jug like material. Let me go back just like you'd find in a milk jug and you know that a milk jug can actually transmit light through it or heat through it because you've picked up a milk jug at the supermarket and you feel it's cold even though you can't see through these lenses with your eye. They transmit microwaves perfectly and they actually bend and refract microwave's. Instead of landing on Galileo's a retina, they land on these, uh, these super conducting sensors that were built up at JPL and they're over here an example of those. So these sensors transduce the microwave heat into electrical resistance and then we're able to measure that and the superconductor very, very accurately. Instead of having a, you know, a, a 10 megapixels like the, what's the current droid model?

Speaker 1:          00:26:49       Uh, so we only had about 256 pixels, so we had less than a milli megapixel. Uh, so it's not that powerful, but don't take your droid and do what we did to it. Namely cool it down to 450, four degrees below zero Fahrenheit, cause it won't oil void the warranty, I'm sure about that. And I don't know what kind of plant replacement plan you're on. So we ended up putting this telescope instead of in Galileo's hands, we put it in a mount that we tested here in Caltech, and then we shipped it down to the very bottom of the world. So this is a telescope that's very much human sized except an addition. Instead of looking through visible light like Galileo did, it looked through microwave and the microwave regime of the electromagnetic spectrum. Then we digitize the resistance that these detectors see as they scan the sky and rotated the polarization.

Speaker 1:          00:27:32       Then we use supercomputers at Harvard and elsewhere to, to process these, you know, many, many gigabytes of data collected over three years. The telescope had to be brought somewhere. Very nice. I would have liked to have brought it, you know, kept it at the, you know, in San Diego or Caltech. We ended up taking it to the South Pole because the South Pole is the, uh, is one of the highest and driest continents on earth. The Antarctica is and dryness as important as, you know, when you go to the commissary here, whatever cafeteria here, um, I don't know how you guys all stay in shape by the way, but when you go there, you heat up water in the microwave, the cup, if it's ceramic will not get hot. You can touch the cup right after boiling the water, water absorbers, microwaves, and it does so very efficiently. That means water molecules in the earth's atmosphere will also absorbed microwaves.

Speaker 1:          00:28:15       We don't want that happening. These photons have been traveling for 13.8 2 billion years. We don't want them to get absorbed in a water molecule floating above our observatory. So people say, well, why don't you put it in space? And I said, why don't you give me $1 billion and I'll be happy to do that? Because that's how much it costs a hundred times more money to build a, an equivalent satellite object in space if you get permission from NASA to do the launch or, or whoever. So, so the early explorers in the 19 in 1911 1912 made it to the South Pole for the first time. No one had ever seen it. People didn't even know about the existence of the continent of Antarctica until the mid 1800 say. And, but at that point, they only saw about half of 1% of it. They knew nothing about this confident, which is much, much bigger than, than the, um, than central United States.

Speaker 1:          00:29:02       So this is the second team that ever reached the South Pole. This is a team led by Robert Falcon Scott, and he got to the South Pole, uh, uh, caring scientific equipment, media rights that he had collected along the way, parts of Dead Sea lions that he had found along the way. He was a scientist. He was doing an expedition. He refused to use dogs because all the dogs that had ever been to Antarctica, they're actually banned now to bring dogs to Antarctica or any animals besides Grad students. Just kidding. Grad students out there, um, you're, you're actually forbidden to bring any animals down there because you always end up eating them. And they would, in fact, the, the Swedish team, the Norwegian team that beat them, they're led by Roald Amundsen. Got to the South Pole in three weeks or eight. The dogs had a big feast at the South Pole, put a flag in the, in the snow and went back home down 10,000 feet of ice and 700 miles north.

Speaker 1:          00:29:49       Of course, everywhere is north from there. This is the second team. And when Scott got there, he said, great God, this is an awful place. And you know, I kind of felt exactly the opposite. I felt this is a totally awesome place, except it's not all fun and games as it was back then for Scott. Oh no, he died. But, but um, but we live, but it's very dangerous place to go. Is this video are captured last time shows. Okay. You think it's really cute? But no, the penguins do not try that. Although I say, you know, I have a lot of friends. I go out to dinner, what they say, you know, I can't decide between chicken and fish. I say, have a penguin. It's like the best nowadays. It's an awesome place when you're down there, the US taxpayers, you hear and you out there and on Youtube, uh, fund this wonderful station but $150 million station built over the last 15 or so years, we'd get, you know, a private room and things that Scott could never possibly imagine.

Speaker 1:          00:30:40       Here's the axis on which the Earth was spinning when I was there the last time, uh, in 2008, 2009, the Earth is spinning about this access and you know, straight down through here is the North Pole. So it's amazing. So I can actually run around the world. I'm not in good shape but I can run around the world in 10 seconds. I think it's pretty cool. There you go. There you have to check in on, you know Google plus. Right? So I took a picture, send it to Google plus and there's the building in which we put that instrument, that beautiful telescope that we spend about five years building and it's called the observatory down here. And then I always say the observatory is the second most important building at the South Pole. Okay. Cause he gotta you gotta take care of business, but you notice the building is built up on stilts and this might interest any of you are on the east from the east coast as I am originally on the east coast.

Speaker 1:          00:31:23       They build houses on the beach up on stilts because they don't want sand to cover him up or decay. The foundation here, snow is the enemy. Snow would eventually over overflow over the entire building within a only about a decade or so. So they, they build it up on, on stilts. The snow can blow and pass right through. So the outhouse has been buried over and we're working hard to get my grad student. No, no, no. The Grad students find a, but it is a, they painted black to keep it nice and warm and uh, but it cannot be built up on stilts that if I do, as I say, often that would be truly worthy of a Nobel prize. A second story. Outhouse. Okay. Don't, don't use them until, until I've tested them for you. So of course, what do we have at the South Pole?

Speaker 1:          00:32:02       We have street view. I love this image down here. This is what, this is what Google thinks. You know, if you get driving directions to the South Hall, uh, you get them from Google. This is what street view shows. So go visit street view. You can actually pan around and this is what, this is what the bicep up to observatory. It looks like. It's pretty cute. We made a huge announcement on Saint Patrick's Day 2014 we said, we detected this twisting roiling boiling surface of last scattering that was infused. We said with gravitational wave energy and those gravitational waves we claimed could only have come from inflation. So we made this huge announcement. It got a of attention. Uh, there was a huge media, you know, storm about it. There was a viral youtube video which got millions of views. You know, this is a scientific discovery, but very arcane abstract topic like inflationary universe, cosmology, gravitational waves, microwave astronomy.

Speaker 1:          00:32:55       And yet within minutes, millions of people had seen this video. This is one of the founders of the theory of inflation and his wife and their professors at Stanford along with one of my colleagues channeling quo who's a professor at Stanford. There was a news conference at Harvard and there was newspaper coverage all over the world. The paper newspaper of record covered it. The San Diego Union Tribune I'm speaking about. Um, so that was here. They put the exact number of seconds after the big bang that we claim to make the discovery. And I love this headline over here. Hold on, I'll get to the onion. And the second, I like this headline, the economist, cause it sounds like just some dude was watching it. All of a sudden he saw the beginning of the universe wholly chow. But for true hilarity, we have to go to the onion. So within days of our discovery, the onion comes out at this headline, top theoretical physicist and R and B singers meet to debate the meaning of forever.

Speaker 1:          00:33:46       And you see down here we can observe longterm phenomenal, like the cosmic background radiation, primordial B mode polarization and the love between India, Ari and her man. All of which seem to have existed since the universe is infancy. And the sub caption says, you the participants debate if it's theoretically possible to give you my heart forever. So I'll leave it to the onion, right? Alas are Nobel dreams were not to last very long. Uh, it turned out that we made a discovery and a very consistent discovery and that discovery turned out to be this very mercurial substance called dust that I began to talk with. So it turns out that there's dust in the interstellar medium that comes from fail. Oops. That comes from failed stars. Stars that have exploded and so called Supernova. And these dust grains can sometimes be made of iron such as the iron in our blood.

Speaker 1:          00:34:33       That's exactly where it came from. There wasn't some iron factory, you know, that made the hemoglobin molecules, these little grains of dust can become magnetized if they're made of iron. And then they become like little compass needles and it turns out the Milky Way Galaxy also has a magnetic field in it. And a compass in a magnetic field will orient towards the magnetic field lines. And in such a case, it can actually orient to produce the exact swirling, twisting, curling pattern that bicep was designed to measure. And in fact that became the most likely culprit for the signal that we saw. We didn't make a blunder, we didn't leave the lens cap on, but what we thought we were seeing is back to the very beginning of time, we thought we were searching from Earth here in the South Pole looking past all the planets, galaxies, plea eighties, everything. Even back to the beginning of time, the Big Bang, the first few, uh, Chileans of a second after the big bang.

Speaker 1:          00:35:23       But instead what we were seeing was more like dust between us and our delaxy and the surface and an exactly acted as an as an imposter signal mimicking the signal. We tried to confirm, again, this is a very pernicious phenomena, a very common one in science confirmation bias because we were told in part that we would get this, uh, of this beautiful Medallia and I'll show you in a second. Um, uh, I do want to take away, cause sometimes I've said, I've given talks where people ask me afterwards like, you got to lay off the dust man. Okay, this is like you're being too harsh on dust. Dust is great and I want to say that I am very appreciative of dust. Not only does dust flow through our star does flow through our veins, but also as Carl Sagan poetically put it, he turned, he had the NASA engineers turn the voyager satellite around after it passed through doing the outer planets in our solar system.

Speaker 1:          00:36:14       And it took an image, a selfie of the earth for millions of miles past, past the orbit of Saturn. And he says here, this image here, and you can see a tiny little dot. He says, you look at that, you see a dot. He says, that's here. That's home. That's us. Every saint and sinner in life. History of our species live, live there on a mode of dust suspended in a sunbeam. This is a camera artifact, the sun beam here, but it's so poetic and it is true. The, the earth is a giant ball of dust that collaborated over eons to form a solid surface that we can stand on. Again, thank goodness or else we wouldn't be here to have this conversation. Dust creates, it creates life. It creates planets, but it also can destroy, I destroys Nobel prizes. And so a, to add insult to injury, not long after we had the discovery retracted, not after we went through this embarrassing painful process of having to retract the claims that we made.

Speaker 1:          00:37:09       I note that we always have, we always see front page headlines and press conferences, but you never see front page headline retraction of previous front page headline or a press conference. We have to tell you we were wrong. Uh, so it seems like the media or in part to blame for stoking the attitude within scientists that, that the press conferences in newspapers, and I'm as guilty as anyone of this, but uh, there's an immense pressure in academia to, to produce these. Everything has to be an outstanding breakthrough and very rarely does that actually take place. And part of the book is written in such a way as to give hope to people that most people don't win the Nobel prize. Most people don't win the Oscars. Most people don't when they're high school class presidency. Right? So how do you deal with failure, embarrassment, humiliation even, and get back up, dust yourself off and get back to work.

Speaker 1:          00:37:56       So to add insult to injury though for me, I came into work in October of 2015 and I found this document that said two dear Professor Brian Keating, we have the honor to ask you to nominate the winners of the next Nobel prize. Okay. So you know, it's like he got fired, but can you give a recommendation to the diversion that should take your job and interview a interview her? So this was a letter that was mark strictly confidential. So don't tell anybody. Okay. Ain't nobody out there telling anybody, but it was, it was asking me to nominate the winners of the Nobel Prize in physics. And, uh, and it was a, it was part of a small set of people that are chosen randomly but not so randomly as I might get a chance to describe and Q and a but a of, of who should win the Nobel prize each year.

Speaker 1:          00:38:41       And this actually set me on a very interesting quest that became the second meaning of the double entendre of the book's title. So the first meeting is how I lost the noble prize dude, thanks to dust or no thanks to the US. And the second meaning is what I learned about the Nobel prize that shocked me. And in the process of nominating winters, uh, for the 2016 prize. So I'm an academic, right? So what do we do as academicians? We go back and look at primary reference material. So I went back to Alfred Nobel's will, and I'm fluent in Swedish as we all are now. So I couldn't read it, but thankfully it's translated online. You could find it. And what I found in his will was really surprising. And what it's led to in the preceding hundred and 20 years since he wrote down the will and hundred and set and 16 years of Nobel prizes is quite surprising.

Speaker 1:          00:39:27       So what he said was in his will, he said, the whole of my estate should be given and divided in the following way. A portion of it should be given to the person or the persons there, the person during the preceding year who has conferred the greatest benefit to mankind. And it says later, one part to the person, not in the, in the, in the plural, in the singular. So Nobel prize, it should be given for discoveries or inventions that had the greatest benefit to mankind in the preceding year. And I started to think, hmm, how many astrophysics discoveries have benefited all of mankind and done so in a year? And it started to make me think of like, what were the original intents of the Nobel prize and how did those early Nobel Prizes get carried out? And how have we overlooked great discoveries, uh, or not. So I'm going to show you here.

Speaker 1:          00:40:14       I'm going to give a quiz, which I, which I gave at Facebook and they all got it right? So I want to ask you guys, see as how you guys are. Good. Okay. So, um, am I allowed to say Facebook? Okay. So I wanted to ask you guys, there's three choices here. A, B, and c. So raise your hand if you think the RNA molecule won the Nobel prize. These are all eligible for the Nobel prize. They're all invented after Alpha Nobel stuff. Anybody think that the RNA molecule, the most important precursor building block of human life and other lives? Nobody. Okay. A couple people. Good. The periodic table choice B, raise your hand. You think periodic table. I remind you. There's an element on there called no Belgium. Okay. Invented by men to live. Okay. There's like one or two of you guys. Good, good.

Speaker 1:          00:40:51       And then choice c, uh, appears to be like a lighthouse. Anybody think the lighthouse could the lighthouse? Really? You guys think the light? God, the guys at Facebook got it. Now of course it's the lighthouse. Of course. It was given to Gustov the in 1912 for his invention of automatic regulators for using automatic automators and boom, lighthouses and buoys. Unbelievable. It benefits our life every day, doesn't it? I mean I was just, I had to come up here from San Diego and I thank God I had those gas accumulators guiding me along the way. So, okay, so maybe that was just an early blunder, but actually it's typical. It's actually what Alfred Nobel wanted. He was an inventor, right? He had Google patents Galore and he wanted to reward things and this did benefit back in, you know, people were crashing into rocks and Sweden and he didn't want that.

Speaker 1:          00:41:36       So this was very typical actually of what he wanted. And it's more of so significantly, you know, to to say in 2013 when the discovery of the Higgs Boson, actually the prediction of the Higgs Boson was rewarded. And I ask people like, how often throughout the day do you say, oh, thank God for the Higgs Boson and like at least the lighthouse get, you know, did something practical. And of course has been other controversies with the Nobel prize. There's some, uh, some examples, I'm not commenting on any of them, but just these are controversies that have been aroused and some of the winners have been a little bit unsavory. This is one of the most egregious examples. William Shockley who won the Nobel Prize for the invention of the technology that you guys would not have jobs without, namely the transistor. He got the Nobel prize and yet he said terrible things about eugenics and ideas for sterilization of African Americans.

Speaker 1:          00:42:23       And he thought that was a way to increase the Iq of the world. And he was one of these, uh, actually he was studied in this famous study called Turmans Termites, a study of future Nobel Prize winners, brilliant men in society. And they want to see is there a correlation between Iq and the Nobel prize. And he was one of the counter examples because his Iq was below average or are about average. And, and so, and yet he did win the Nobel prize. There was a famous book written about him, so he was very generous. Uh, not with his money. Uh, putting his money. He kept his money in the bank, but he also kept other things in the bag. He was one of the first donors to the famous Nobel Prize Sperm Bank, which is located in lovely San Diego County. So you can come visit it. No, no, it's not in existence anymore.

Speaker 1:          00:43:02       And when they went bankrupt, I guess nobody made any withdrawals that we know about. But this is all done in a social engineering eugenics thing that you would be put in jail to do nowadays. So a, so that was, you know, another controversial example. I'll hit other ones later, but keep in mind the criteria, the criteria that Alfred Nobel stipulated a single person in the preceding year conferred the greatest benefit on mankind for all the prizes, chemistry, physics, physiology. The Nobel Prize in economics was added 60 years after the first Nobel prizes. So it wasn't part of Alfred Nobel's will and is actually no longer called the Nobel prize in economics. Someone says, I won the Nobel prize in math. You know they're lying because there's no such thing as a Nobel prize in math. And they also say I won the, I'm a noble and won the Nobel Prize in economics, actually called a much catchier name.

Speaker 1:          00:43:47       Now it's called the Swedish Central Bank prize and honor the memory of Alfred Nobel. So put that on a tee shirt here. Yeah. So last year the Nobel prize was given to the discovery of gravitational waves from the orbit of two black holes that can crashing together about 1.3 billion light years away from Earth. The signals travel throughout the universe or throughout from galaxy to our galaxy and were detected in September of 2015 and I want to take us through this example because what actually ended up happening when the detection was made in September, 2015 it was a billion years after more than a billion years after the discovery of the actual event. What happened between then and and and detection between the production of the black hole, a signal when these black holes crashed and the eventual Nobel prize award is actually illustrative of one of the biggest problems I have with the Nobel prize that it can't be given away posthumously these black holes were announced.

Speaker 1:          00:44:42       The detection, these black holes were announced about 11 days after the deadline for my nomination in 2016 so the j the January deadline passed and you have to have your nominations in by the 31st of January every year or else they'll just throw them away and they don't save them for the next year. The Lygo announcement was not made in the famous press conference in DC until the 11th of February, so they missed that deadline. That means I could not nominate them. I nominated somebody else and I, and I can invite you to guess who it was. I, I trust you will not be able to guess who it is, but I don't mention who I, who I nominated. But I didn't get to nominate these people because they never made the announcement in time for me to make the nomination. So they would have to wait till the next year and all was fine except for the fact that one of the three founding fathers of Lygo Ronald Drever died on march seven 2017 that meant when Lygo actually was awarded the Nobel prize in 2017 he was left out and another person, Barry Barish up at Caltech took his place and even bearer said if they had given the prize away a year earlier, I would not have won it because the Nobel prize can nowadays be one by up to three people.

Speaker 1:          00:45:46       Another rules change that they've made. So what does this illustrate? This means that if these black holes had crashed together 11 days earlier and everything else in the history of the universe proceeded at the same way, and there's no reason, maybe they think, not that this man would have a Nobel prize. And in fact, uh, and then the other men, uh, Barry Barish would not, so it's so capricious because of this rule that they made up themselves in 1974. No posthumous Nobel prizes. And they actually have given it away three times to three men. And I was talking about sexism in the price in just a second, but, uh, they give it away. The three men and two of the three were Swedish men. Okay. So, uh, so some people say there's, there's lots of forms of bias with the Nobel prize. So, uh, uh, you know, sort of poor Ron drivers memory and his family don't have this accolade to really look back on.

Speaker 1:          00:46:34       Now this is going to become a big problem. This, this, this plat hair. I've been told you guys are very quantitative and you eat up data. Um, like I'm going to eat up lunch in a little bit. Uh, this shows the long timescales between the discovery of a Nobel worthy invention or discovery and the award for several different branches of science, fixating on physics. These blue curves here, it shows that from the 19 hundreds up to 2000 it's now getting up to about 30 years plus between discovery of an effect and the Nobel prize that's awarded for that discovery and what's not increasing. And then I made a plot in my book where I took data from the Nobel Prize website on the age of different people when they won the Nobel prize in each decade. And I came up with this plot here. I say this plot here and it shows that the early Nobel prize, the average age was in the, you know, say 50s then it went down to 40 almost and now it's been rising faster than a of years per decade.

Speaker 1:          00:47:31       And a couch are eventually going to hit this deadline, right? Think so. There's not, there's not too much. I mean maybe you guys can help with this, but eventually the average age of the Nobel laureates this past year was 78 years old. The three men average age 78 so this is going to become very serious. Where the passion is. Price is always going to be given away. Unless you guys, and this could actually happen, I predict in a few years, it could be that artificial intelligence wins Nobel prizes. Why not? There's nothing. It says, it says the person, well, they already gave up the, and so why can't they give a person as well? So I want to just point out a couple of technicalities and this is who gets to nominate the winners of the Nobel prize. You don't need to read, it's mostly Swedish Nordic, Nordic people. And then down here there's people like me, people that the academy sees fit to ask to nominate.

Speaker 1:          00:48:14       So that was my category number six in the pecking order. But notice number three in the pecking order are Nobel laureates in physics. So if you win a Nobel prize, you're automatically entitled for the rest of your life to nominate winners of the Nobel Prize. And that has important ramifications. It turns out you're five times more likely to win a Nobel prize if your phd advisor was a Nobel laureate or your postdoctoral advisor was a Nobel laureate. And that's part of this, this, this phenomenon. So a and that means it's harder to break into that. Like if you're, if you're from a different group than is traditionally been awarded the Nobel prize to break into that, whether women or minorities, it becomes harder and harder for them to also get into this track where they can, the rich can get richer so to speak. And they gave me the last piece of helpful advice they gave me.

Speaker 1:          00:48:59       No one can nominate him or herself. So that was helpful and not narrowed it down by one person. Um, so I wasn't allowed to do that. I want to talk briefly about this clause. This is actually the opening statement of the Nobel Prize. Endowing will says, I Alfred Nobel do here by after mature deliberation, declared my falling to my last will and testament to my nephew [inaudible]. I don't know how to pronounce that. And Ludvig I bequeath the sum of 200,000 Swedish crowns to my niece, Mina. I give 100,000 crowns so the men got twice as much as the wind. Some people joke that this is the root of the Nobel prizes sexism. I think it actually runs deeper than that. Nobody knows why he gave the women the woman half as much as the men, but speaking of, you know, half as much or two entities. These are all the women who have won the Nobel Prize in physics.

Speaker 1:          00:49:45       The first one, Marie Curie won it in early 19 hundreds and she was almost denied it. In fact, they weren't going to give it to her until her husband and Colorino and said, I'm not going to accept my prize for radio activity unless you give it also to my wife, because she did most of the work. So they ended up giving it to her, but it was grudgingly. And then Maria get bird Mayer who is at Uc San Diego where I am, she won the last Nobel Prize in physics in 1963 54 years ago was the last woman to win the Nobel Prize and, and physics. And when she wanted, she was only able to win it after being nominated 27 times, which is twice as many times as Albert Einstein had to be nominated to win it. Why is that such a big, Albert Einstein was forbidden almost by the rules of the regulations of the early part of the 19 hundreds because Jews weren't allowed to win it.

Speaker 1:          00:50:34       And in fact, because previous winners were allowed to nominate future winners, and they were the part of the committee that decided who wins the Nobel prize, they were including Hitler's chief of Arion physics and man by the name of Phillip Lin art, who had won the 19, uh, 1905 Nobel prize. He had a mandate that Einstein could not win the Nobel Prize because he practiced theoretical physics, which was a form of world bluffing Jewish physics. So Einstein was forbidden, but only for 15 years. Women have not won it in 50, you know, first it was they didn't win it and then she had to be nominated 27 times before she actually wanted. So it's just remarkable. And when she wanted in our hometown paper in San Diego, the paper of record throughout the world, the San Diego Union Tribune, the headline read San Diego, housewife wins Nobel prize. That was the headline in October, 1963 just incredible. Here's a graph shows women a fraction of women, you know, so there's only been two women that want it.

Speaker 1:          00:51:30       So I always joke, you know, that means that there's only two more female Nobel Prize winners in physics than there have been female pope's. Okay. Female Pope's people. Okay. All right. Um, so again, why could this be, well, one reason is this clause that previous Nobel laureates can nominate future Nobel laureates and that could be part of the reason that we have this. Of course I like to point out, I don't know, I've been giving this talk a couple of times to other other groups of people and I, and I keep showing this, maybe you guys will get it, but the back of the Nobel prize medallion, if I turned my real Nobel prize over here, no, if I fake one, you'll find two women, Mother Nature and this God has known as the genius of science and she's taking the veil off mother nature's face. So that's pretty cool.

Speaker 1:          00:52:11       Um, but I noticed that like what we really have is that you have a picture depicting two women and they're kind of, you know, wouldn't be having this conversation unless there was a dude there. And so this is an example of a failure of what's called the Bechdel test. If you guys know about that, that's a very important scientific test. But it has actually another example of that. So I wrote this book and part of the book I joke is about idol worship. Uh, so in, in physics there is no greater stature then you can have than to be a Nobel laureate. It's really something that people aspire to. So much so. And I have no problems with the people who have won it. A, it's more of the committee and the structure and the system that I believe has systemic problems that are preventing, um, uh, the meritocratic award of prizes.

Speaker 1:          00:52:53       And maybe during Q and a, I can address those. This is a, uh, uh, a friend of a former colleague at UC SD. This is professor Dunkin Haldane. He ended up winning the 2016 Nobel Prize. The one that I was nominating a winners of. I did not nominate him. Do not tell him. Okay. I did not nominate him, but he won. He actually won with one of my former professors at Brown University, Michael Costa, let's, and another gentleman and he came back to UC SD that day. I submitted the first draft of this book, losing the Nobel Prize. In this book, I decry how physicists elevate the Nobel, the status of idols that they basically are willing to, to, you know, kind of sacrifice so much and really to be an awe and, and bask in the aura of the laureates. And the Nobel prize. Look, I took this picture you can't hardly see.

Speaker 1:          00:53:37       Then it glows with a white hot intensity and it just has a super, super luminant glow to it. And look how all these students, and then the faculty that came up to him and they were oohing and aahing and just gushing over him. It was pathetic. I was like, you guys are rational science. He supposed to be the most rational, you know, critical thinkers in all of humanity. How could you stoop solar? It's disgusting. Oh my God. Somehow the Nobel prize gets in my hand selfie. Okay. Even I would have been given this incredible, you know, uh, opportunity to a sale, the Nobel prize from the insides and dissected and appoint out all of its flaws too to make it better. Uh, succumb to it. And he's luckily a very wonderful man. I want to close a talk with a couple of points as to what will come next, both in cosmology and in the Nobel prize, hopefully.

Speaker 1:          00:54:24       So getting back to my theme, dust to dust, we began or talk with dust. Dust came in as a villain, but I want to point out a very noble, a person about an Ama, Mahatma Gandhi. And he gave some advice to experimentalists like me in this story called the story of my experiments with truth. Gandhi said the seeker after truth should be humbler than the dust. The world crushes dust under its feet. But the secret after truth should so humble himself that even the dust could crush him only then and not until then will he have a glimpse of truth. And I think that's part of what we need to have as cosmologist and as practicing scientist in general, to look for ways to be humble and have humility in order to strive and make the, that make the great leads without focusing on arbitrary awards or accolades, prizes, money, whatever you venerate to the level of, of your idol.

Speaker 1:          00:55:16       So what comes next in science is a huge collaboration. BICEP had 49 people all, you know, all of which would not have written, most of which would not have won the Nobel prize even if we were confirmed. Uh, instead we have a much bigger collaboration building on the lessons of Bicep, I suppose, not a failure. It was one of the most successful experiments in history because it measured signals that are so minute that no experiment has caught up to what we did with bicep even after four years after the uh, announcement. So we didn't retract them findings, we retracted while we claimed as the interpretation, we said we saw the fingerprints of creation, we really saw the dusty fingerprints of the Milky Way Galaxy. So now we're taking lessons learned. We're building this big observatory in the Atacama desert of Chile called the Simons Observatory. And this telescope is going to be located, here's a street view or Google earth view for you guys out there.

Speaker 1:          00:56:05       And it shows kind of the killer app for this technology is a new type of detector, same kind of superconducting instrumentation, except that uses a fractal pattern in tena. And this fractal antenna has extremely wide bandwidth frequency coverage. So can simultaneously measure dust and measure the cosmic signals if they're truly, and then from the some of the cosmic signal and the dust signal, we're going to subtract the dust signal and what will be left with hopefully as the pristine signal from the early universe. But we won't know until we do it. What's the other part of, you know, call to action next and the Nobel kind of front? Well, I want to close with the final sentence and Alfred Nobel's will, he said is my final request that after my death my veins shall be opened. And when this has been done and competent doctors have confirmed clear signs of death, my remains to be cremated and our crematorium, why did he want to do this?

Speaker 1:          00:56:55       Well, he was terribly afraid of being buried alive. It was a condition that people were, that's called tap a phobia. I googled that. And, and it means that you're terrified of being buried alive. So much so that in caskets they used to put bells so that if you were buried alive, you had this, you know, intercom system and you could, you could ring the bell and people would open you up. But I like to point out, you know, if he wasn't dead and then the doctors opened his veins, that would be kind of the, the coup de Gras, right? So he, he cure his tap a phobia right there. But it made me think we should not be scared of opening the veins on the prize and really examining the depths of what the prize is become. So in the news just this week, these are all headlines from this week.

Speaker 1:          00:57:34       Nobel prize is all over the headlines. It's great publicity for my book. But um, but there's a sex scandal rocking the Nobel prize in literature. There's a financial crimes unit, which is investigating the Nobel, the Nobel Committee's Donald Trump is in the news for a potentially being worthy of the Nobel prize for peace and a, and then there's people that are defecting from the Nobel committee because they don't want to have a part of it anymore. So it's a very dangerous time. And I claim that, that the committee wants to save these prizes to restore them to the luster, the lure that they once had and the, you know, so if you do, um, if you do one of your Google searches on, on the search terms and their popularity over history, what's that called again? You guys shoot on Google trends. So I did a Google trends and I looked up a Pulitzer prize versus Nobel prize.

Speaker 1:          00:58:21       It turned out for the early part of the 19 hundreds, the Pulitzer prize is much more popular than the Nobel prize. In fact, the first noble prizes, the winters didn't even show up to get them. Nowadays 100 million people watch them on youtube and in person. So they've gone just exponentially more popular. They're moving into this glitzy new building in Stockholm. It's billions of dollars at stake and the national prestige. So if they want to save it, I've made some proposals in this book, uh, that I think are very concrete, very well organized. I color coded the pages in the book. There's three chapters about the Nobel prize. So if you don't care about it, you can skip those three colors in the kind of choose your own adventure book like we used to use as kids. But I want to use the prestige and the name of the prize to reform it for the better.

Speaker 1:          00:58:59       So we've established a site which we call when you call losing the Nobel prize.org and it has the capacity to submit petitions to the Nobel Committee's to advocate for both rectification of past prizes. Say this is Jocelyn Bell who discovered pulsars radio beacon. So bright. You can set your watch to them and see them across the galaxy. Her advisor got the Nobel prize, but she didn't. It's called the Matilda effect. When a man gets a credit for the discovery of a woman, there's nothing in the Nobel statutes that prevents her from winning the Nobel prize. Just because her advisor wanted it would seem that if you want a justice to prevail, she shouldn't be allowed to win it. Or what about Ron Drever who died and didn't win it or beer or Ruben who died just on Christmas Day 2016. Why shouldn't she when it, when physicists say, well, you couldn't, you can't win it once you're dead. I say, Oh, I forgot what law of physics. He talks about that for the Nobel prize and it doesn't and we shouldn't treat it like a law of physics. So I urge people, if you're interested after reading the book, um, go to the site, losing the Nobel prize.org. You can submit petitions and I thank you so much for your attention and I hope that you'll visit us on online as well.

Speaker 2:          01:00:02       Thank you.

Speaker 3:          01:00:07       Thank you so much Brian. That was amazing. Um, it's, uh, we're a little bit after time, but if anyone wants to ask a question, we have the ability to do that. So just raise your hand. I can throw something at you. Uh, so it seems like the early universe has a lot of quantum chaotic effects in it. Do you ever see that it's perceivable to simulate potentially with a quantum computer or the evolution of the universe?

Speaker 1:          01:00:37       Yeah. So yeah. So is it possible to simulate? So it turns out in physics, most of my colleagues, um, and friends who, including a professor John Presto up at Caltech here and people in San Diego, um, they tell me that a lot of the, the, the power of a quantum computer, at least in her, in terms of solving practical problems, are toward solving quantum systems. So solving Lagrand Jan's or things that are really complicated, quantum mechanical, um, uh, variables and plotting wave functions and things like that. So if indeed the universe is described by a wave function or what's called [inaudible] that describes how the energy and transfer of energy took place, then yes, quantum computers could have a revolutionary capability to understand it. I should say though, that there's a divisiveness in the cosmology community right now and it's every bit as combatitive as the old debate between the steady state universe and the Big Bang theory.

Speaker 1:          01:01:25       So, you know, we don't have a TV show called the steady state theory, right? So we have the Big Bang theory that would be pretty boring. Uh, but the steady state there, she used to hate the Big Bang theory is for a variety of reasons, but one of which was that you couldn't falsify the big bang. You could keep changing the models of the proud owners of the theory in order to get what you want. It nowadays are echoes of that debate and what's called the multiverse, which is a consequence of inflation and in many models of the inflationary universe. And there's a new type of a variant of the steady state called sick lick or bouncing cosmologies where our universe didn't have a quantum state. It actually just collapsed from a previous universe. Expanded again, what we call that expansion point is the big bang, but there's no quantum transition. So in those universes there's only classical physics at work and in that case our classical computers are sufficient to deal with that physics.

Speaker 3:          01:02:13       But nobody's simulated that. Right.

Speaker 1:          01:02:15       I think people are now, there are people that are doing it. They're also simulating a, I I've seen on classical computer simulations of um, you know, it's called quantum chromo dynamic effects, the vacuum and actually understanding how particles can pop out virtually and the vacuum. And I think it's just a matter of time before the first step, in my opinion, will probably be, I mean, somebody out there might already be doing this, but first use quantum computers on the QCD Lagrand Geans and then transferred to the vacuum state of the inflationary at park. I think it's eminently possible. I hadn't thought of that. It's a really good point.

Speaker 2:          01:02:46       Yeah. Couple of questions.

Speaker 4:          01:02:52       So you talked about the pressure to get scientific results out there, to have these major impact, uh, press conferences. And it seems that that was part of the issue. Have you given a thought to reforming that process as well?

Speaker 1:          01:03:11       Yeah, so I've, I've thought a lot about that. And, um, I was gratified to see that, you know, and my colleagues that are in the medical school or law schools or whatever, they have to take classes in ethics and that's part of the curriculum. And, and even, um, and even people that are, you know, in, in university settings and other cases that may, we'll study ethic ethics, but a, in physics and cosmology, I never have class in ethics. They barely teach us how to be a professor. So, um, so what I would like to see is the ethical implications of making it an announcement like this. It could have potentially impacted very young people, graduate students and post docs, and then the, the notion of the retraction. And then oftentimes you hear something called like the Keating effect and then it's debunked. And then there'll be, you know, Keating's ground students, you know, so you'll get the name transfer and they'll be the, the, the Grad student blunder.

Speaker 1:          01:03:58       Okay. Um, my Grad students never make blunders. Uh, but, but nevertheless, a lot of times the power hierarchy must be preserved. And I think the, the, the, the perception of science as being purely meritocratic error correcting, I think it, I think it's a little bit bogus. I think that scientists are a little bit too, too full of, of how they view themselves as, you know, it's kind of like, well, ethics are easy. You know, we're really smart. We have high qs, you know, we give this burn back. No, we don't do that, but, but, um, but, you know, we can, we can intuit these laws, but I don't think so. I think, you know, so we're actually having a, uh, a play done in San Diego, uh, by the, uh, by the, the Department of, of, of theaters putting on a play about an ethical dilemma faced by, and I had nothing to do with this by a physicist who's on the verge of winning a Nobel prize.

Speaker 1:          01:04:43       I always point out, I think it'd be a really cool play or book and maybe there'll be my next book. Um, you know, there's four Nobel worthy discoverers of some, you know, cure for cancer or whatever. And then you know, it's a murder mystery because only three can win it. Right? So how do you deal with these issues of credit of priority in science? It's citations. You guys know this, this Google scholar, it's one of the tools we use every single day. And you know, how do you determine who got there first? It's who wrote the first paper and who made the first announcement. And a lot of journals like nature and science won't allow you to, to do a press conference until you've had peer review. We bypass that and we, we open sourced it thinking that high time that we get away from the Stodgy old journal system that's been around for 200 years. It probably would have been better if we had brought in at least, if not an ethical kind of consultants, but even bringing in your competitors because they're not going to scoop you. And all in a day or two before the results, sit down, talk about them that it air your dirty laundry and do so in the scheme of what we ended up doing, which is to understand the universe, we actually ended up working with our arch nemesis at the time, which is this Planck satellite.

Speaker 2:          01:05:43       Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:05:49       Okay. So my question is related to that question. Okay. So I want to know, what do you think about the true impact of Nobel Prize and science? Like would there be less or more scientific advancement if there was no Nobel prize? Yeah, it's interesting.

Speaker 1:          01:06:01       So I've been getting two different types of comments. One is that Oh, you have sour grapes, you're a sore loser. And I point out where like a lot of the book is written about women in science and minorities in science and you know, I'm not a woman in science, right? So, and, and kind of advocating for past injustices to be rectified. Um, and then a lot of other things are saying, well no, the number Keating's right. Cause the Nobel prize is so superlative that people, even than last year's Nobel Prize winner, he called the Nobel Prize, uh, the original sin in physics. In other words, it was the thing that was responsible for making so many premature announcements about discoveries of gravitational waves earlier, even earlier than our discovery in the 70s. And so, um, and then there are people that say, you know, they really do venerate. I mean we're taught, I was talking with, with Keith, I think about it, we're taught the history of physics really.

Speaker 1:          01:06:47       We don't know it. And when I teach my undergraduates, I'm, I'm, I'm teaching them here, all these Nobel worthy, you know, things that we discovered, you know, that's not my intention. I just say, well, here's the Michelson Morley a factor. Here's the, you know, Fineman path or girl effect. And, and I go through it and then you look back and say, all those are Nobel prize. But that's not the way science goes. Science proceeds forward in history, looking back in history. Okay, that was a wrong turn that they could have avoided. So I think there is this excess elephant emphasis placed on the Nobel prize. I think many scientists much more, you know, a kind of even killed them than myself. They're able to, to not even care about it. And that's kind of the place that I'm at now. People say, well you wouldn't, you know, you, you and turn it down and I say, well try me.

Speaker 1:          01:07:26       You want to see if I'm sincere offered me the Nobel prize next year. But in reality, I think it influences some people. Just like I always say the Academy Awards, I don't think you guys are here in Hollywood area, right? So I don't think any actor or actress says, my whole goal in life is to win an Oscar. Cause you know, you're going to be one of 150 million women that could win the ask her each year. But the, you better believe that the movie studios wants you to win an Oscar. And they want every single, you know, except for, you know, whatever weekend at Bernie's nine. But, but you know, they invest in it. And B and g, who are the analogs of the movie studios in science, the National Science Foundation, NASA, the Department of Energy, the not, you know, so all these three letter agencies for later, they all want, and if you go to their websites and Google on their websites to see, you'll find it instantaneously. Here are all the Nobel laureates and including, you know, places like laboratories and private industries. So it's a very big, it's a subtle pressure and definitely receive it.

Speaker 6:          01:08:17       I think that's all we have. Time for it. Thank you very much. Thank you guys for coming. [inaudible].
