Speaker 1:          00:00:06       Thank you very much for giving me the opportunity to talk with you guys today. So, um, yeah, I'm a computational astrophysicist. So you know, my day job is not thinking about aliens. Um, they've kind of my night job. So my day job is studying things like how stars form and how planets evaporate. I do a magneto fluid, large scale supercomputer Nitos, uh, fluid dynamical simulations of astrophysical cas dynamics. But because I do a lot of work with the public, you know, I've been thinking, I've ended up having to think a lot about climate change cause I write about climate change, um, and over the years, you know, I've had to deal with a lot of climate denial and that is unbelievably frustrating. And in deal doing that, um, I came to start thinking about the problem differently about how, you know, ways of the ways in which we frame climate change entirely wrong.

Speaker 1:          00:00:55       Um, and so that's really what the, the topic of my book is. So light of the stars, Alien Worlds and the fate of the earth. Uh, so what I want to take you through is kind of a different perspective on thinking about climate change, um, from what I would call the astrobiological perspective. So the idea here is you can't solve a problem until you understand it and you can't understand it until you can tell its story. And my premise here is that the story we're telling about climate change is the wrong story. And it's not our fault, it's just that we're in a different position now and we can tell a different story. And the story we're trying to tell about, uh, the, the, is the human future, what is the human future on a climate changing planet. But in some sense, really what I'm asking you is what does the future for any civilization, um, a large scale industrial civilization on any planet?

Speaker 1:          00:01:43       I'm going to take you through why that's not a crazy question to ask. Um, so the problem we know is climate change, right? That, uh, the Anthropocene anthropogenically driven a change in the planetary state, um, that we are switching from a state for the last 10,000 years that's been basically warm and moist. Uh, meaning most of the stuff isn't a lot. Most of them are not most but lots of the waters and locked up in ice to something, um, that we don't know, right? We're pushing the earth into a new state. And then there's also a couple to this are issues of resource depletion from freshwater to forests. Um, so you know, this issue of sustainability comes up, right? Can we build a sustainable version of our planet? And when we think about science and politics, right? Cause that's somehow whenever we want to have this conversation, that immediately falls into the political domain.

Speaker 1:          00:02:31       And while certainly policy is a pillow, you know, there's going to be politics to science itself is what gets cast suddenly becomes political. And when you think about this, it's really amazing. And when I did the research for this book, I realized that, um, or I found that actually a president in 1965 gave a speech to Congress identifying CO2 and climate change as a potential problem, right? So the idea that somehow this is this modern hoax that, uh, you know, climate denialist wanted to tell you about is this gives lie to it, that know in 1965 actually that should be President Johnson gave a speech before Congress where he, you know, uh, mentioned CO2 as a and the climate change as a particular problem. But so we know what's happening now is this political polarization that somehow this science issue got lumped into all the other kinds of polarization that we have.

Speaker 1:          00:03:19       So if you have a certain set of beliefs for some reason, you also have to think that climate change is a hoax or climate change isn't happening. Um, and that's part of the dilemma we face and trying to take any action on the problem. So what is the real problem? You know, what is the real problem that we're facing? Um, and it's really one of a, a perspective, not politics because the science right has been settled for a long time. My first job after undergraduate, I took a year and a half off and I did lots of crazy things like planting trees in British Columbia. I was a bouncer at the rocky horror picture show on the, the eighth street playhouse in New York. But I also got a job in 1985 add, um, Jim Hansen's Goddard Institute for Space Studies. And you know, I asked them, yeah, it was a programmer, basically a scientific program.

Speaker 1:          00:04:03       And I said, yeah, what are we doing here? And they said, Oh, you know, we're studying to see whether or not the climate is going to be changing. That's an idea we have. And I was like, whoa. Right. So this was 1985 long before anybody else had heard of it. By 1988, Hanson gives that very famous, uh, uh, testimony in front of Congress saying like, look, we actually have found the signal. So the, you know, the science is old. And so the science is not the problem. It's the perspective that's the problem and our perspective. And I think the reason we have such a hard time, uh, you know, the public and I deal a lot with the public and for my science writing is that, um, we think it's a onetime story. We think we are a one time story, right? We think climate change is something happening to us and you know, that's the only time it's ever happened and there's no guides, no examples, no other no way of framing this that allows us to see something deeper in it.

Speaker 1:          00:04:50       So a, so all we ended up doing is fighting about whether it's happening or not. Okay. So what I'm going to argue in the book is that we have to broaden the perspective to truly understand, uh, what is truly happening. That's the basic idea here. So what I mean by that is we must learn to think like a planet. And that is something that, you know, over our history, our 10,000 year history of civilization, we'd never been called upon to do before. And by civilization, what I mean is agriculture city building, right? Clearly human beings have been around longer than that, but it's in the post hole a scene or that, you know, after the ice it last ice ages and did not post Holocene. But after post ice age that, you know, we built this kind of, we started building this kind of civilization and it's only now that we, the planet is starting to notice that we're here and in order to deal with the problem, we're going to have to start thinking the way a planet thinks.

Speaker 1:          00:05:40       And what I want to argue is we've only learned how to do that in the last 20 years or so for a bunch of reasons. Okay. So a little test, um, which of these is the earth, but is it all of them? All of them. Yeah, that's right. That's exactly the question. I, Oh yeah, I'm going glad when people see that. Right? So, you know, the idea here is here's six different earths, right? That this, this one is the earth. Uh, and in the Hadean right after it was formed, it was a liquid magma ocean. Uh, this is a version of the earth that was a waterworld. It took a while for the continents to grow. So when you, when you see those, you know, animations of the continents sliding all around, those only go back a few, a hundred million years or so. Because in the beginning all we had were what were called Creighton's.

Speaker 1:          00:06:21       They were, it took a while for the continence to grow. So earth was a waterworld. There were periods when the planet has been so warm that's had been virtually no ice anywhere on it. So we've been a jungle world. There's been periods when the earth has been a snowball, basically glaciated almost from top to bottom or from a pole to the equator. Here's the earth. We have the happier as we know now. And here is the earth. You know, it actually not all that long and maybe another 2 billion years or so that as the sun heats up, like any main sequence star, we'll do, um, the temperature is going to get high enough to push the earth outside of the habitable zone. So the point here is that there earth has worn many masks, right? And we need, you know, what, what's happening with us now is we're changing the mask that the earth is about to wear.

Speaker 1:          00:07:03       So we should get used to this. Um, and it should become part of our story. Now, you know, the earth. So as I said, the earth has had worn many masks because I love this a, a diagram that I'm a friend of mine or a guy I know, I knew drew just a beautiful representation of all the different eras and epochs and eons of the Earth's history. And you see all of the different times and the different kinds of animals. But what's important is we're up here in the whole scene, right? And, and each of these different earths represents wildly different conditions that the planet has passed through. Okay. But what we have been living in the last 10,000 years with geologically is not that long, is the whole scene. And here's a record of temperature and there's zero. This is variations from, uh, from the current average.

Speaker 1:          00:07:45       And here's ice content. Well, you can see as the ice has been going up and then down, up and down. And these periods when the temperature is sort of pokes above zero is these are interglacials. So the whole scene, which is the entire history of human civilization as just the latest, uh, latest interglacial. So the whole of human civilization, while our history or our wars and hardship and creativity has been in the whole scene. But if you look at the earth's history overall, and this is one of the revolutions I'm going to talk about that we've undergone in the last 20 or 30 years, that give us this new perspective on what's happening to us with climate change. You see how dramatically life and it has played a role in these transitions. So what, here's another question. These the only two, I promise, the only to test questions.

Speaker 1:          00:08:31       What would happen if you landed on the earth about 3 billion years ago and walked out of your space ship? What's the first thing that would happen? You'd suffocate for it. Good. Because you know what's amazing, even though the earth had lots of life on it, lights had been on the earth for a billion years. There was no oxygen in the atmosphere, right? The oxygen. It was a, it was a pure, almost a nitrogen co two atmosphere. Um, and uh, the, um, most of the, uh, oxygen got put in place around 2.5 billion years ago in what's called the great oxidation event. So this is a plot of oxygen concentration versus time. And you can see the oxygen content was a million times less than it is today. Uh, back then, even though the earth we had was rich with life and what created the great oxidation event, it was blue, green bacteria.

Speaker 1:          00:09:17       There was the invention of a new kind of photosynthesis that used water as a substrate and burped out or Fart it out depending how you want to look at it, a fart it out, oxygen, thereby changing the atmosphere of the entire planet and changing the entire evolutionary, um, uh, history. The evolutionary trajectory from that point on, not just for life though, it had huge consequences, right? You couldn't have big brains that like we have without the energy that comes with oxygen metabolism, but also for the planet itself. By having all this oxygen and completely changed the chemical cycles that regulated the planets. Uh, you know, uh, um, uh, the planet's history, for example, it created ozone without an ozone layer. You could never do without ozone. You would completely change the dynamics of the surface from the life's perspective. Without ozone, you could never have colonized land.

Speaker 1:          00:10:07       So it was, it was, uh, the, the step and the great oxygenation event that actually allowed the land to be colonized. So this is an example and it's something very important for us now that life is constantly co evolving with the planet, right? So this is a, in this plot, what we see is on this side is things that have happened in Earth's history going back 4 billion years and things that have happened in life's history. And you see, there's this constant feedback between them where the development of a methane eating bacteria will drive, um, uh, uh, the great, uh, uh, snowball, a snowball phases of the earth's history. Um, having oxygen allowed sex actually to happen because it created a, allowed you to organisms to figure out, um, sexual reproduction. So life and planets co evolve. That should be a lesson for any life on any planet, right?

Speaker 1:          00:11:02       What we've seen is that the biosphere, uh, is an important actor in the history of our planet and we should expect that should be a, a, an important actor in at least other, some other planets. So this leads to what is called the Gaia hypothesis, which has, is very, well, it's controversial, but let me tell you a little about it. It was proposed by James Lovelock in 1979 and the idea was that all living things on earth kind of function as a super organism, that that creates some self regulates the planet for, um, the for life, right? That basically, you know, even though the sun is increasing in temperature, the feedback loops created by particularly microorganisms will regulate the planet's temperature to keep it cool even though the overall solar radiation that's hitting your planet is going up. Um, and this was actually an incredibly important idea here is, uh, it was Lovelock and the famous biologist Lynn Margulis, who got together and sort of really built this.

Speaker 1:          00:11:57       And it was a very controversial idea when it was first proposed. And part of that, because it became kind of a new age sort of, you know, there were guys in churches and they were guiding, you know, a festivals. It became a very new age, woo idea. And there was one reason why scientists didn't like it though. Well it's because of the idea of teleology. It's somehow seemed like an implied, like the earth wanted to go somewhere like the earth had a mind and it was trying to, you know, direct itself for some purpose. And of course we know that evolution is blind, right? But over time, both, you know, Margulis and Lovelock, we're able to show that there's no teleology here. These are, this is still blind evolution, but that these feedbacks do in fact work. And so what happened was people kind of dropped the name Gaia and it became earth systems science.

Speaker 1:          00:12:41       We talk, we now don't talk about Gaia. We've talked about the couple of earth systems. And by that we mean the biosphere, uh, the, uh, atmosphere, the hydrosphere, which is all the water, the cryosphere, which ends up playing a huge role, all the ice and then the lithosphere. So what we now understand is that the earth is this very strongly coupled system, a couple of systems, they all interact and that life is been driving a lot of this, uh, evolution for quite a long time. So that was really the main result of Gaya was to get scientists to understand that life is not some green scruffed the sitting on the surface passively, that it hijack the planet a long time ago. And when we think astro biologically, this is a key idea for us as we go hunting for other biospheres. So right now there's an enormous amount of work, some of it going right on over at Mit, um, developing models of so biospheres and they're using these kinds of ideas as the fundamental way we're going to detect life on other planets.

Speaker 1:          00:13:35       We're going to look for signatures of biospheres, chemical signatures of biosphere is, it's a very guy, an idea. Um, and actually goes back to Lovelock in 1963 he actually proposed that idea. So, so this leads us now to the Anthropocene, right? So now we have some background here about, you know, about life and coevolution and planets. We come back to ourselves, which is our entry into the anthropocene. So the idea of the Anthropocene, it was first proposed by crucial and Stromer in 2002 and they were thinking in terms of strata, they were actually proposing that, you know, a million years from now you would be able to see the earth's entry. You know, our, our presence by a layer of strata that would have Kevin Cole or isotopic signatures of our presence. But even more than that, it was the recognition that human beings now are the, are the drivers, the principle drivers of changes in those coupled planetary systems.

Speaker 1:          00:14:28       Right? And this has now been verified in multiple ways. Things like we can, you know, it's human beings who move around most of the phosphorus on the planet. Climate change is an obvious example. Land colonization. There's many, many markers you can find to show that really it's human beings that are driving how this system behaves, which means we're pushing it, right? So the climate or the, those couple of systems, it's nonlinear complex system right now it's been sitting at the bottom of a well, right? You know, in potential energy, so to speak. And now we've been rocking it hard enough over the last hundred and 50 years that we're now, you know, it's starting to roll off into some other states. So the Anthropocene is something that is happening. Um, uh, and the question is what are its outcomes and do its outcomes include us, right?

Speaker 1:          00:15:12       So the entry into the Anthropocene, racist, profound new questions about the nature of human activity, uh, within the couple of planetary systems. And what I want to show is how by taking this large, this 10,000 light, your view of this, we actually gained a pretty powerful, uh, new way of talking about climate change. One of these is, I just had an, an New York Times op Ed, uh, two days ago about this is that, you know, this is not about saving the earth. The earth is going to be just fine. Thank you very much. Right? So this is, this whole often gets framed as like, oh, climate change, we have to save the planet. Um, but I'd say I like to say, you know, the planet is not a little furry bunny. That's one of the lessons of understanding. Um, uh, the earth history. You know, there are five known mass extinctions.

Speaker 1:          00:15:51       Each one opened up new niches for species to evolve, including like this little critter here who's, you know, your ancestor, right? This was a mammo that was around during the time of the dinosaurs and it was only the mass extinction that allowed, you know, uh, she and her progenitors to lead to us. Okay. So even though we're driving a mass extinction, you know, in terms of the longterm history of the earth, the planet, we'll just use though that for, um, uh, for a, for a new round of evolutionary innovation. So when we talk about sustainability, what we have to be very careful is to understand what are we trying to sustain, right on. What are the moral imperatives that we invoke for doing so. So often. For example, you know, we show these pictures of, you know, polar bears on lonely ice flows to, you know, to, you know, drive some guilt and some, you know, and some action hopefully.

Speaker 1:          00:16:41       But, but the idea is there, you know, when we think about this is that, oh my God, we can't let the polar bears go extinct. But on the other hand, who's crying for this guy? Right? You know, the velociraptors were once around, you know, and they went extinct. Lots of species have gone extinct. Okay. So, you know, we need to understand what exactly were we trying to sustain. Is the polar bear for itself or is it the sort of our framing inside the eco inside the biosphere? I need to, to make something very clear. Right? Cause at this point, some people will get really angry with me. Like, we don't care about polar bears do care about polar bears. Right? But the polar bears get fit into this larger question, which we're not asking. So for sure climate change is an immediate and possibly existential threat to the project of civilization.

Speaker 1:          00:17:21       It is imperative that we act immediately and you know, with, with some, uh, force in order to deal with it. So nothing I'm saying here takes that away. But the problem is, one problem is why haven't we acted right? W Y after a gears and Johnson brought this up, why haven't we acted? And part of my argument here is that we've had the story we've been telling us has been able to be co-opted. You know, the story, the main story we've been telling has been co opted by climate deniers as a way of blunting, um, our activity. So what are we trying to sustain, sustain what we really are trying to sustain, sustain, if we're being honest, is the climactic conditions that are amenable to a particular kind of civilization hours, right? It's technological, it's energy intensive. It's got a pretty high population. I mean, hopefully we can bring the population slowly down, but unless somebody wants to volunteer, you know, to off themselves, you know, it's going to have a high population for a while.

Speaker 1:          00:18:13       And also what we want is maximum human wellbeing. Actually what we want, you know, you can add to this maximum biospheric wellbeing, including polar bears, right? But we have to understand that really what we're trying to do is we're trying to hold some version of the whole scene, right? We are, we are preferencing, uh, preference, having prayer, great preference for the whole scene, right? And we have to understand why we're doing that. So, you know, we should be honest about why we're doing that. And as the amp, as the anthropocene goes on, one of the things I'm saying is what you're going to be holding is a version of the whole scene. It's not the Holocene anymore because we're here and we're going to have impacts.

Speaker 1:          00:18:49       Um, so by sustaining the Holocene in perpetuity, we take on the role of planetary stewards. And what does that actually mean? Um, what does that make us? How do we fit into nature? In particular, right? Um, in some sense the view I'm advocating the, uh, city is no different from a forest, from the biosphere's perspective, right? We are what the biosphere is doing right now. Okay. So m and a particularly what is nature in a planet that has a technological civilization on it, a large scale, energy intensive technological civilization. What is nature, what, what counts is nature anymore. Um, so now I want to come to, you know, the, this will be the second half of the talk, the astrobiological perspective, how actually thinking about planet generically, which is what we should be doing because that's what we've learned over the last 20 or 30 years. Um, uh, how does this change, how does this reframe everything I've just been saying? So astrobiology is a relatively new fields about thinking about life and its planetary context. It's about thinking about what's happened here and what might happen elsewhere in a deeply scientific and deeply, um, uh, interdisciplinary kind of way.

Speaker 2:          00:19:59       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:20:00       So there's been three revolutions that have happened in astrobiology, um, that we want to address. And you know, so clearly astrobiology right now has an n equals one problem, right? We only have one example of life. And you can say like, well, how do you even have a field when you only have one thing to study? The thing is though, that if you take that point of view, you're missing some amazing things that have happened, right? So it's a very data rich field in the sense of these three revolutions, the discovery of exoplanets, the exploration of our own solar system and the unpacking earth, 4.5 billion year history. So very quickly, let's sort of look with those are. So number one, exoplanets. So when I was a graduate student, there were no other planets in the universe except our own right. This question of exoplanets dates back, you can see the Greeks arguing about it, right?

Speaker 1:          00:20:43       So, um, uh, uh, Aristotle felt that, uh, the earth was the only world of its kind in the entire universe. Um, and, um, uh, you know, other Greek thinkers, the alchemists in particular were very sure that the universe was full of planets and all those planets had life. You follow through history and you can see sort of people switching back and forth. By the 19 hundreds, it was thought that planets were very rare because the way they thought planets would form is that the only, the only way you could get it was two stars passing close to each other and getting gravitational IX, you know, extrusion like Taffy. So those, those collisions would be so rare that it was thought that planets, you know, one in a trillion stars would have planets around it. And, and so this went on until 1995 we discovered our first exoplanet.

Speaker 1:          00:21:25       Right? And that was, that was, it's not often that you get to live at a time when a 3000 year old question gets definitively answered. Since then, something remarkable has happened, which is particularly the Kepler mission, which uses transits when you look for the, uh, the planet passing in front of the star. So the light dims a little bit that now suddenly we went from, you know, sort of a retail planet hunting to wholesale planet hunting. And so now what we know remarkably is that every star, pretty much every star you see in the sky has a family of worlds around it. I mean, that is a remarkable, planets are everywhere other than perhaps the most massive stars, which themselves are very rare. Every star has planets. And if you count up five stars, one, two, three, four, five, one of them is going to have a planet in the right place for life to form.

Speaker 1:          00:22:10       It'll be what's called the habitable zone, where liquid water can form. And then we think water is essential for life. So one out of every five is in the right place for life to form. Okay. So that was one revolution. The other revolution was, you know, we've sent robots, robot emissaries, now, robot ambassadors to pretty much every kind of body in the solar system, asteroids, comets. We visited every planet in the solar system. We've had rovers rolling around, you know, at least one of them. Um, but we'd had stuff's Tut that touchdown a lot of others. And so we get pictures like this, which, you know, could be Mars or it could be the Mojave desert. Turns out it's Mars, right? But we've now, you know, we, this has been a decades now that we've been rolling around on Mars and we've learned amazing things. For example, we now know for sure that Mars was a blue world, you know, and the early part of the solar system, Mars most likely looked like this.

Speaker 1:          00:22:58       It was, had a much thicker atmosphere. It had water, you know, you know, uh, at least lakes if not oceans on it. There's a strata that we can see that you can estimate a, you can do the estimate to show that water would probably hip deep was rushing it about three feet per second, um, uh, across that channel. So it's remarkable. So it shows us, especially in dealing with climate, is to show people that, you know, it's not like we just have the earth to study when it comes to climate. We have tested our climate models against Mars, against venous, against Titan, and those models all I can predict the weather on Mars basically tomorrow with great accuracy, right? So the idea that these climate models are just kind of always something somebody made up, that's, you know, it's just completely wrong. We know how climate works because we've seen how climate work now, the climate works now on, you know, six different kinds of planets.

Speaker 1:          00:23:46       All very different. So, uh, our study of the solar system has it, that's what's taught us to think like a planet, or at least gave us, taught us how to think like a planet without life, right? And then through the earth study, we're able to think like a planet with life. Um, what's also important is to show that, you know, sustainability is just like, habitability is probably going to be a moving target. We're going to have to learn to think that way because the march used to be habitable, but it's certainly isn't now except for maybe, you know, just very extreme of file kinds of creatures. Okay. So that was revolution number two. And then revolution number three, as I kind of already went through is the unpacking of Earth's history, the great oxidation event, the, um, uh, the thermal maxima that have occurred when the planet was a jungle world, the snowball earth.

Speaker 1:          00:24:31       We now really have seen that earth is so many different habits, has been so many different planets that in some sense it gives us all those different areas. It's almost like we've got nine different planets with life to study by studying the Earth's history because they were so different. So we're, what does all this lead us? Well, um, by using the astrobiological perspective, we can think about the anthropocene and a broader planet or broader context. And then this question comes up, right? Which nobody ever asks. We all know that we have to build a sustainable version of civilization, but how do we know that's even possible, right? How do we know that something the universe does, the universe has, makes black holes, universe makes comments, universe makes interstellar clouds of a gas? How do we know what makes longterm sustainable versions of energy intensive civilizations, right?

Speaker 1:          00:25:16       Because it may be that there's just no such thing like that in the universe. So this, by framing it this way, suddenly, you know, we get, uh, we're going to ask the questions in a very different way. But of course, obviously it means taking exos civilizations seriously, right? And I'm using exos civilizations rather than aliens for a particular reason, right? So now when I say this, I'm not talking about detection. I'm not talking about going out and finding them though. You know, that is definitely an interesting thing, particularly in the era that we're in when we have all these new exoplanets. Um, I'm not talking about the details of their biology, whether they look like reptiles where they have nine fingers on each hand, you know, uh, what kind of sex they have. That's just like, that's not a medium. There's no, I don't have any constraints scientifically that actually addressed that.

Speaker 1:          00:26:02       Um, and certainly not sociology or they communist capitalist peace loving not, you know, there's just nothing I can do there. What I can do, however, is I can focus on the coevolution of civilization and a couple and coupled planetary systems in a scientific way. I now know enough to run models of this interaction and ask what the generic response of a planet is when it's got an energy intensive civilization. Okay? And that's what I'm going to convince them to show you a little bit of those results. We've run those models, just actually publish them just a little while ago. Right? But so, you know, my, my emphasis here is it's really time to start doing this because it matters for us. And that means it's time to take [inaudible] civilization seriously. And it's time to stop snickering about it, right? Because anytime you try and bring up aliens, it's always like, you know, uh, and that was a long time in the scientific community.

Speaker 1:          00:26:50       It's because of prosthetic foreheads, right? The reasons we can't talk about it's aliens seriously is because we've had years of bad television science fiction where, you know, everybody looks like us, but they've got maybe antenna on us. So, you know, we're in a different universe now, right? We recognize the civilization that we've built is the kind of alien civilization we've always been dreaming of on a certain level. Right? So, so, you know, we need now to get past the snicker factor and ask because that's our own, it's related to our own, you know, survival in some sense. Okay. So what am I telling you now for the next 10, 15 minutes is a, we're going to head towards a science of exos civilizations. Okay? Theoretical studies that are relevant to the anthropocene. So first of all, uh, we have to recognize when we think about Ekso civilizations, it's always been a battle between optimists and pessimists, right?

Speaker 1:          00:27:35       If you look at the history of this field, and what I'm going to argue is that it's not that that changes significantly with the new data. So I'm sure many of you are familiar with the Drake equation, right? So a long interesting history. The Drake equation was basically a way of figuring out how many civilizations exist right now that we could communicate with. And they did that by breaking up the problem into a bunch of different pieces. The number of stars in the galaxy, the number of the fraction of those stars that have planets, the number of those planets in the palatable zone, um, the fraction of those planets that form life, the fraction of that life that goes on to intelligence, the fraction of that intelligence that develops technology. And finally, as I like to call it, the final factor, bump, bump, bump, boom, the average lifetime.

Speaker 1:          00:28:18       That's actually the thing we're really interested in. What is the average lifetime of a civilization like ours? Okay. So, um, I won't go into this in detail, but in a paper that we did in a couple of years ago, um, woody Sullivan and I use the Kepler data, right? We've got all this data about planets now, which we didn't have before and we used it to sort of figure out, well, what can you say about exos civilizations empirically based on all this new data? And what we found is that if you asked the right question, you could say something pretty remarkable. Um, so here's what we could, we define something we called the pessimism line and it answers the following question. What does the probability for a civilization evolving on a random planet have to be for humanity, be the only time it's ever happened. What's the limit on that probability from this new data that we've gotten a so that we're the only time that civilization has ever happened and we can do this now.

Speaker 1:          00:29:06       We can set an empirical limit on this because we now know if I go back right when Drake did his, when Drake wrote down this equation, that was the only term that was known. Now these two terms have been nailed. Okay? So that's a pretty large increase in your understanding. Uh, for this equation, it's only seven terms in it. So it turns out the prop for us to be the only time in cosmic history that is civilization has arisen. The probability would have to be 10 to the minus 22 or lower right? One in 10 billion trillion. If the probability for forming a civilization on a planet, and you know, nature's is going to set this right through its evolutionary process, if it's any larger than this number, it's happened before. Okay? That's a pretty small number. Okay. You don't have to work very hard in order to get higher than one in 10 billion trillion as if as long as it's bigger than that, we're not the first time there's been a technological civilization.

Speaker 1:          00:29:58       Okay? So, uh, what that means. So if you look at like famous pessimists and time Ernst Mayer or Brandon Carter, I won't go through this. These are people who were like, no, civilizations are really hard to make. They never happen. They're really rare. There are numbers are so much larger than that pessimism line that there's been tens of millions or trillions of civilizations over cosmic space and time. And the reason why it was important to do this, it was because what we really asking is if you had a statistical ensemble of alien civilizations, what would their history be? Right? They're all going to go through what we're going through. That's part of the argument is that you, it's hard not to trigger an anthropocene because a civilization is just a way of taking energy, harvesting energy from your planet and doing work. Second Law of thermodynamics is kind of gun to demand that you have some kind of feedback.

Speaker 1:          00:30:40       So, um, uh, you know, with this work shows is that it's really not hard. You know, you don't have to work very hard in terms of the probabilities to be end to end, to end up with the conclusion that there's been lots of histories. And so, you know, doing thinking statistically about, uh, anthropocenes, um, is not a bad idea. So the Anthropocene, it's happened before probably, right? Which is a remarkable thing. So that's what this idea that like, we look at what's happening with earth and you know, we have this huge political debate. Everybody's freaking out because it's as if like, we're a teenager who do, you know, going through our emotional stuff and we kind of feel like, you know, nobody's ever gone through this before. And then they talk, yeah, they get to an encounter group or something and they talk to others and realize like, oh, everybody's gone through this before. So by modeling this, what can we figure out? So the claim is we know enough about planets and how they respond to forcing meaning, you know, sermon dynamic driving to begin modeling how any species will drive feedbacks on their planet through energy harvesting and civilization building. So this is what I call a time with tongue held politely and cheek, the theoretical archeology of Xo civilizations. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:31:44       so how do we do this? Well, but we're going to do is we're going to do dynamical systems modeling. We're going to set up equations for a population interacting with its environment. And this is a time honored process in population biology. Going all the way back to the Predator prey model where you basically have an equation for the bunnies and equation for the wolves. And they're coupled, right? Cause the, when the wolves eat the bunnies, they get more wolf babies. Um, but the more too many wolf babies and there's no bunnies left to eat. So you know, you can write down these equations, solve them, and you find these a oscillations, these, uh, that are out of phase beautifully. You know, the data really matched this really well. So population biology, you don't have to assume a lot about population biology other than, you know, you eat more resources, you get more babies. That's, that's the only assumption I'm making in this, these stimuli or the models that we're making. And maybe you can say, okay, well maybe on a life on another planet doesn't do that. But you know, that seems kind of fundamental to what we think of as life.

Speaker 3:          00:32:36       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:32:37       Um, so, you know, uh, when we thought doing this, what we imagined is we'd have some phase space of planetary parameters, right? Like energy consumption, population feedback on the planet. And what we imagine is when we run, ran the models, we'd get different kinds of a solution. So like you could imagine you start off with a very low population and you're not using a lot of energy per person. And what happens is as time goes on, your technology increases, you start using more energy in your population goes up, you make more babies, but eventually at some point you're using so much energy, you're feeding back on the planet and your, the trajectory of your population will end up, you know, heading in this direction and it gets too large. And perhaps, you know, the planet responds, you start having instabilities, wild climate changes, and then your population would, you know, come way back down.

Speaker 1:          00:33:20       You basically collapse, right? That's a collapsed trajectory. Or You could have a sustainability instructor. We figure out how to deal with this and you end up with some nice steady state where your population is, is stable and the or feedback on the planet is stable. So this is what we were looking to do when we built our models. And it's very interesting to look at the earth right now. This is the, a world energy consumption from 10,000 BC to now. Uh, so that's our energy per capita. This is co two concentration, which is the planetary forcing and this is global population. So those are those, uh, those three things, those three parameters for the earth. And you see that, yeah. Like we're, you know, we're pretty much on a trajectory for something enormous increase, exponential increase in world population, uh, energy use and the feedback on the planet.

Speaker 1:          00:34:04       So what happens next generically? So what we did is, you know, these models, actually the paper just came out recently. Um, I won't go into the equations that we use. These were actually, you know, these were, as you guys all understand, a toy model, right? We tried to capture the essential of the interaction between a population using a planetary resource, making more babies, but having that planetary resource feedback on the state of the planet so that you end up, you know, the planet drifts away from where it was when you were born. Okay. As a civilization. So here's what the solutions look like. So in these plots, um, green is the population of the civilization and red you can think of is planetary temperature. And what we found broadly, even in these simple models were three classes of, of, um, of, uh, trajectory. First was what we call die off, right?

Speaker 1:          00:34:53       So here you see the die off the population. You know, a population rises very quickly because it's consuming the planet's resource. Um, the, the planet heats up the planet to conditions on a plan to change. Um, but, uh, so then the p the population overshoots the planet's carrying capacity, how many of that organism the planet can sustain. And then you get a big drop in the number of, uh, the population until you come to some kind of Nice steady state, but you do it at some cost so you can lose weight in our models, up to 70% of your population. So imagine that everybody you knew, seven out of every 10 people you knew, uh, disappeared because of, uh, you know, climate related disasters. Um, so it's not clear that a civilization could survive that. Maybe it could, but, um, but at least, you know, the good news here was he did get a steady state in the end.

Speaker 1:          00:35:38       There was also what we call the sustainable or soft landing. That was the really good news. Yeah, there's definitely solutions where you change the planet, the, you know, read, the temperature goes up, your population goes up and your energy use goes up, but you come to some steady state. So the model's admitted that kind of solution. But there was also the possibility of the, of the collapse and there's, you know, there's enough in there to be a worrisome where the population rises, the planet goes into a runaway, essentially just like Venus went into a runaway with a runaway greenhouse effect. Why Venus is temperature is now 800 degrees. Um, so this is a different kind of runaway, but at the same basic idea and your population comes all the way down to extinction. Now, whether or not you actually are extinct, what really matters is you can't maintain your technological highly coupled, you know, networked civilization anymore.

Speaker 1:          00:36:21       So that's in some sense would collapse means you also, interesting, we found these oscillations as well in there. If you don't have the population rises and falls and rises and falls. Um, so, but either way. So these were simple models, but they gave us a hint that there are generic classes of behavior in the models. Okay? So this leads us to, you know, eventually. So this was a first cut at this. What the next step is, we're going to build in real climate models, we're going to build in the response of different kinds of energy sources, right? There's only going to be so many kinds of energy sources. A planet gives a young civilization, you're going to have combustion, maybe not fossil fuels, but if there's bio mass, you can burn it, um, wind, solar, etc. So we can build that into these and really have, you know, much more, uh, uh, uh, physically accurate kinds of models.

Speaker 1:          00:37:06       And then we can run it for all kinds of planets, planets that are close to there, the inner edge of the habitable zone, planets that are further out, planets with that start with oxygen, planets that start with less oxygen. Uh, we can do all different kinds of things. And from that, what we're going to get is a predict and we're going to make a prediction for this average lifetime. Now this really matters for us because if the average lifetime of a civilization is 200 years, we're hosed. Right? Because what it means is there's very little wiggle room. You don't have a lot of leeway in the bets you make as you try and navigate your anthropocene. Almost nobody makes it, right? On the other hand, if you're, um, uh, tie, if your average lifetime is 2 million years, yeah, then you can make mistakes. There's a lot of, you know, you could experiment and still make it through lots of civilizations managed to make it through their anthropocenes.

Speaker 1:          00:37:53       So, you know, this is the thing that we're headed towards seeing and this itself sort of frames what's happening to us now in this, the sense that we are, you know, one species out of many species that have gone through this and, and you know, we sort of need to think more broadly about what are our choices in that case. Okay. So more to the point then we're almost done here. The astrobiological perspective, what it tells us that energy harvesting species and their civilizations are simply are simply something that planets do. Okay. We can't keep thinking of ourselves as somehow special or unique. Um, we are, uh, what the biosphere is doing now, right? Um, the biosphere are camp runs experiments, planets with biospheres runs experiate run experiments over and over again. And we are simply one of those right humans and then, and are human beings and our civilization, we're just part of nature.

Speaker 1:          00:38:44       You know, the, the biosphere has done lots of interesting things. It did invented grasslands. That was a new idea at one point. Right? Um, and then the grassland spread across the planet, change the planet's functioning and invented dinosaurs. It invented bluegreen bacteria. We are just with the biosphere has invented and is playing with now. And there's no reason to think that we're going to be what, um, uh, happens later. So we're an expression of the planet now, but do we continue to be an expression of the planet? So one of these things, right? So this is very controversial. I can get people really get pissed off at me for this. Um, what this means is climate change is not our fault. One of the things I want to push us away from is this narrative we have of that human beings are a plague on the planet.

Speaker 1:          00:39:24       We suck, right? When it comes to climate change, we don't have many stories, right? Many, many sort of species wide, planetary wide stories about ourselves. Because as I said, it's a new transition. And the only story we have either is it's not happening at all, which is what you get from the climate denialist or were terrible, were horrible, were a virus on the planet. And what I'm pointing out here is that that's not true. So what do I mean by this? Before anybody gets really angry with me, what I mean is that, you know, civilization since its beginning has done what it has always looked for. Energy sources that it can power. It's, you know, buildings, right? It's irrigation. And we've been doing this since the end of the, uh, the, the whole scene, right? So when we found oil, it wasn't like we were like, ah, I was destroying the planet with this substance.

Speaker 1:          00:40:10       It was like, Oh, this is brown guru and it's awesome. You can heat your home, you can build internal combustion engines. It was great stuff. We didn't know we were going to trigger climate, right? It was, it was an unintended consequence of the adoption of a particular energy modality. Right? Um, but now that we know, if we don't do anything right now, not doing anything about it would be our fault. It would be our failure. It would be our folly. You, it'll be why we end up in the garbage heap of civilizations that couldn't manage their transition to maturity. Okay. So you know, it, this doesn't absolve us of the responsibility of doing something about it, given how important it is. So what I'm trying to do here really is change the narrative, right? The anthropocene is not a story of inherent human greed. It is not a story of our unworthiness on the planet and the plan is trying to get rid of us.

Speaker 1:          00:40:57       In some sense. It's a snotty story of us as being a plague on the planet. Instead, the Anthropocene is a story and that we're just waking up to about planets and their experiments, right? We didn't know about earth 4.5 billion year history of life and coevolution until very recently. That is a new story for humanity. And now we have to recognize is how we fit into this, right? Both because it's true and also it's the story we need to understand to make it through the, what were the climate change we've triggered. So for me, the true at lesson, so childhood end, any science fans, right? One of the great science fiction books, uh, the true lessons of the anthropocene are that planets have rules and we need to learn them, right? Planets are machines, right? And we need to understand how they function in order to re to put ourselves back into them, right?

Speaker 1:          00:41:49       Sustainability is really in some sense and awakened planet in which both the biosphere and the civilization can flourish in entirely new ways. There's a paper we wrote recently where we looked at what would be the thermodynamic properties of a planet with a large scale civilization on it. And the conclusions we came to, there's gotta be some kind of cooperative, you know, relationship where we, the civilization makes the biosphere even more productive, not just for itself, but for, you know, uh, you know, not for the civilizations in, but for the biosphere is end. Um, it's really, and this is about the adoption of what you know, has been called deep ecological values were compassion and the identification with life because we were part of the biosphere. We're not above it is a kind of primary value. Okay. And this is what's interesting for me. It's actually the completion of Gaia, right?

Speaker 1:          00:42:34       Remember when I talked about, you know, one of the big scientific pushbacks on the Gaia hypothesis was that it was teleological. It had meaning it had a direction, right? And we know that evolution is blind. It's blind until something like us shows up. Once you get a technological civilization, you're no longer blind, right? Uh, the evolution is no longer blind. We bring meaning we bring direction to now, to the evolution of the planet. So this is idea that goes way back of the know sphere. I don't know if anybody's ever heard of this. So, um, there were two versions of this, uh, Teilhard de Chardin, which was a little bit more mystical. He was, uh, uh, a scientist and a Jesuit, uh, as well. Um, and he sort of thought of it as the word, you know, the world being in shrouded in thought or in the world soul.

Speaker 1:          00:43:15       But there's also a verb Dansky Vladimir for Dansky the great geochemists idea, which was more like, yeah, the, you know, once thought appears on the planet now, just like there's a biosphere, there's going to be, you know, a sphere of thought around it. And, um, the interesting thing was shard Dan's version of this, of the world being covered in thought, what the more mystical one was, the one that most people know about. But of course, what happened is by then, you know, if this is the great place to talk about this, we ended up building a no sphere, right? I mean by mistake, we didn't know we were going to make a note of here, but like, yeah, right now this room is full of electromagnetic radiations carrying thought, right? I mean, everybody's cell phone is picking up on the know sphere. So you know, the idea of, um, there being a directionality to the biosphere is evolution.

Speaker 1:          00:44:00       Once, you know, a technological civilization shows up, um, may actually be, you know, now that the world is covered in the know sphere, right? So this is, these are the, you know, Internet links, um, across the planet that may actually be a natural part of the evolution. So, okay. So with all of this, for me actually leads, it's a story of hope, right? So I did an Atlantic story about those that, that, that study of, um, the, the study we did of the different possibilities of interaction between the planet and it's a, at a planet and a civilization, right? And all of a sudden, I didn't Atlantic story on it and it got picked up and everybody was focusing on all the trajectories that led to death and disaster. And I had to be like, Whoa, wait a minute. One of the trajectories with sustainability. So like even though simple models point after the fact, like, yeah, you can do this, you know, I mean from that simple perspective, you know, if the question is, is sustainability possible, the answer is yes, it may be hard to achieve, but at least it exists according to those very simple models.

Speaker 1:          00:44:53       Right. So the uh, so I'm hopeful, you know, so in its context, the, um, the, in the cosmic context, in some sense the Anthropocene doesn't happen. It's not a story with villains in it. Right. As much as I am very angry at the people who promote climate denial, they're not villains, they're folly. They are the agent of our folly that will lead us to not reaching our own potential. Okay. But from the biosphere's perspective, you know, there's, there's planets have histories, they have trajectories and hopefully you can manage to get yourself on a good one. Oh. And vote out the people who are keeping you holding back. So it's a story about winners and losers and re essentially what I want to say is that we are cosmic teenagers and that we need to grow up. So, you know, I think someone has done it.

Speaker 1:          00:45:36       So why can't we, and I'll end with this. This is a picture of Bill Nye came to the University of Rochester. Um, and he gave a talk and I was amazed. I mean, I, you know, I grew up, I knew bill Nye when I was a graduate student, you know, even in Seattle, but I didn't realize like the, uh, how much the student, how much the love the students had from it. And you know, he was there talking about climate change, how students can, you know, solve climate change. And these guys were all there and they were like, here, I never saw so much optimism and hope, you know, so like, I absolutely think this is a, you know, a, a solvable problem on, but we have the wrong story and can we change that story? We're going to kind of be, our options will be limited. So I thank you very much. I really appreciate your time and listening.

Speaker 2:          00:46:18       Okay.

Speaker 4:          00:46:19       I don't know if anybody wants to ask questions, but yes. Uh, I'm curious about one part of one slide possibility of a civilization once you're in the habitable zone, unbelief was tend to the negative 22,

Speaker 1:          00:46:35       not the possibility that the, that if we don't know what the actual problem

Speaker 4:          00:46:38       bloody yes, right. Yeah. Right. The limit, the pessimism limited. If it's below that, then we're the only time it's ever happened. Right. If it's, if nature's choice for those, that probability is above that, then there's been lots of wondering if though, if you could expand, we basically said, well, that's a really small number. Right. And absolute value. It's very small. Right. So therefore I'm going to bet that it's larger. Right. That doesn't seem very satisfying to me. There are lots of numbers in nature of the turnout to actually be very small, smaller than humans would have desks and there was a tune up. I'd be me hugely bigger than humans would have guessed because we tend to anchor. Yeah. Yeah. It was around one. Right. Uh, so

Speaker 1:          00:47:16       yes. No, that's a good point. That's why the history of this debate is important, right? That number doesn't appear out of nowhere. Yeah. Well I mean, you know, it comes from that number doesn't appear out of context. Right? So there have been over the years, over 50 years, people trying to approximate, you know, do some kind of calculation that shows them what this probability should be. And the best of them all is what's the, what's called the hard step model by Brandon Carter. And that's at the heart step models now become, you know, actually essential because you could actually calculate probabilities out of it. And what he did, it's typical brilliant reasoning, you know, uh, where he just basically like he looked at the history of the earth and said, oh look, the earth is only going to be habitable for another billion or half, maybe a half billion years.

Speaker 1:          00:47:52       And intelligence didn't show up until the end. Right? So therefore it must be intelligence must be hard. Right? And so then he came up with this idea, there must have been a bunch of hard steps that evolution had to go through. So from that he was able to use the correct probability, distributions, et cetera. And he gets, you know, he estimated that there were 10 hard steps, right? And so then he calculated out of that what that probability had to be there for. And he got 10 to the 20 and he concluded in that there's actually, I put that quote in there, I'd have to switch all the back. But he basically said, based on this 10 to the minus 20, sorry, you said, based on this, we are the only time that civilization has ever formed in the history of universe. Now you do that.

Speaker 1:          00:48:26       You've got data, you put it in and you find it. No, actually in your mind, and you know, Brandon Carter's model, there's a hundred civilizations that have occurred across cosmic history, right? And we now know that there are not no, but now the idea is there's not 10 heart steps. There's maybe only five heart steps. Now, again, this is all still, you know, controversial, you know, um, we don't even know if the hard step model is true, but it's the best one that we have that actually gives us a law, allows us to do something, uh, articulate something numerically. And with five hard steps, you're down to a 10 to the minus 15, which means there would have been 10 million, um, uh, uh, civilizations over cosmic space and time. So, you know, when you look at the history and what the, uh, you know, almost no pessimists historically has gone that far down.

Speaker 1:          00:49:08       So, so if, if they were right, there would still have been lots of civilizations. So hope that helps. Yeah. I mean, just, it's still, of course we are in the realm, you know, until we actually find one, you know, you're going to be dealing with, but the best science we have, the history of this field, people, you know, the, the best estimations makes that number very, very small. Yes. You're walking too much Saifai lately. Excellent. Um, so I'd watch the expanse of law fe best show ever, right? Yeah. The chances of humans actually getting to the, to a full solar system. Why, what I argue often is that's the prize. If we make it through climate change, that's what's waiting for us. I mean, I really do believe, you know, interstellar travel where I'm actually right now writing a paper about the Fermi paradox. Interstellar travel may be very, very difficult, but interplanetary travel, especially if you have some kind of fusion engine will not be.

Speaker 1:          00:50:03       And, um, I think, you know, in another 200 years, like, who knows, right? There are obviously very formidable problems, but I'm hopeful, you know, I'm a techno optimist and I'm hopeful that, you know, uh, you know, in 200, 300 years there can be a lot of people, uh, you know, that this is the solar system. There's a lot of nooks and crannies that, you know, human beings can, um, and, and you know, people say, well, why would they do that? Because, you know, basically everybody wants to their own society. This is, you know what, I love the expanse gets right. There's going to be Mormons in space for sure. So they can create their own space settlement and live Mormon light and there'll be the odd thousand versions of that. So, um, I think, yeah, if we can just figure out climate change and they're related, right?

Speaker 1:          00:50:42       Because you're not gonna be able to, in order to, you know, to solve climate change, you have to think like a planet. But in order to have a self sustaining, you know, whatever bubbles civilization with a million people and that you also have to understand how planets think and build a, you know, smaller version of it. That's why the expanse gets so well. And you know, the scene after the, uh, after co what does the Callisto or Ganymede after the station on Ganymede collapses and, and what's his name, pack recognizes that, oh my God, the whole infer, the ecological infrastructure of the thing is going to collapse. Now does anybody watching the expanse or people watching the expanse? It's really good. I really got it. And the books are super awesome too. Yes.

Speaker 1:          00:51:20       I'm curious what your thoughts are, but yeah. Well, first of all, I want to, you know, there's two things, there's two ways to think about the Fermi paradox. The first one is the idea that, um, you know, we haven't found anybody, you know, we've been searching the stars for signals. We haven't found anything. And that's just not true. I mean, there's never really been a large scale steady effort, right? Said he's never been really fully funded. NASA, NASA started to do a large study search and then because of William Proxmire it stopped it. So as Jill tarter says, if, you know, if the parameter space we have to search for looking for aliens is the ocean, we have looked at assemble so far, so saying that we haven't found anything, it's just it, you know, that's just not scientifically valid. So we barely begun to look not just in radio but all the other possibilities.

Speaker 1:          00:52:05       Um, but if you asking about the part of the frame parsonage, why haven't we been visited? Like why isn't it, why don't we have evidence for, you know, a civilization, the colonization part that actually we find in our paper is more of a problem. And so the solution to that, uh, right now in the paper I think we're leaning towards is that interstellar travel is really hard. You don't get many successful colonization missions. You know, obviously there's some assumptions here, uh, in this. Um, but again, you know, we just did a paper a recently where with, I did it with Gavin Schmidt from Goddard Institute space studies where we just asked how would you, this was amazing question. How would you know whether there was a previous technological civilization on earth 20 million years ago? We actually couldn't, right. There's really, you know, and there's would not be much left over there would certainly after by 20 million years, the surface has been completely re, uh, re scoured. So you're not going to find ruins already. You'd have to look for isotopic anomalies or something, which may be, well that's the thing. No, no, he's right. Actually that's the, that that is exactly what you'd have to look for. So when it comes to just the earth itself, the earth has been weathered so heavily in subducted that it would be hard. And so you know, there's been a couple papers on exactly that about that the best place to look for this is going to be on other bodies. So yes.

Speaker 4:          00:53:13       Related to that, I think the seems to be the one part where you really do have to n equals one problem is what you were talking about the sphere, right? Cause you have all this evidence for what happened to previously. We have all these other planets out there, right? But in a lot of this stuff, especially with the Fermi paradox, it seems to me falls prey to this n equals one problem. We, you're sort of assuming that intelligent or the civilization is going to do is going to behave like we expect.

Speaker 1:          00:53:41       Well I think that's why, that's why my models tried to have no sociology in them. It's the only assumption was a civilization consumes energy to do work. That's like the only assumption in there. So I don't need to know sphere or anything else, it's just that

Speaker 4:          00:53:52       make assumptions about what sort of energy production.

Speaker 1:          00:53:55       Uh, there's only, there's only so much kind of energy production you're going to get as a young civilization, right? The planet's only going to afford you. You know, if you have z raise, I'm like super hyper high tide technology, well then you're already passed this anyway, right? If you have warp drives, you're not really worrying about Europe. You know, you've probably gotten, your science is so far advanced that you're the buyer, you probably have already gone through this. But if you're a young civilization like ours, you've got bio mass or you've got, you've got, you can burn things. There's wind, there's solar, there's nuclear, um, and there's, um, geothermal, right? And that's pretty much it. It's, you can't, you know, maybe if I'm some weird planet, you could have like super magnetic fields or something. So what you can do for each one of those, you can evaluate what the thermodynamic effect of using it large scale.

Speaker 1:          00:54:36       So for example, there was a paper done a few years ago where they looked at trying to extract from wind energy, the power, what would the consequences be of power powering our civilization via wind. And what you find is because of turbulence downstream, you end up with, you know, the equivalent of like two degrees of warming. So, which is important because what it means is you can't power a civilization like this and have no impact the, and so this goes back to nature, right? The idea that there's going to be, we're going to be able to return to pristine nature, not with us on the planet, right? You can have lower impact that you're going to have to be, you're gonna have to figure out what kind of impacts. But the idea that you can have no impact is just doesn't make sense. So yeah, you can evaluate for every different kind of energy source, you know, at least make a cut at what the impact is.

Speaker 4:          00:55:19       Assumption you're making is that civilization requires energy. And that seems to be, that's something good. I think a lot of seems to, we have a very economist way of doing things. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:55:28       well I don't see that's a feminist. I don't understand it. If a civil as they, I mean, you know, in some sense by definition and industrial civilization know. I mean Rome, I'm not interested in Rome, right. Because Rome wouldn't have, Rome wouldn't push it's planet into an anthropocene. Right. So you know, if a civilization decides to get up to rums level and never gets farther, yeah. That sort of out of the, you know, you're right that that's not what I'm talking about. But if you build an industrial civil, if you start heart, it's all about the energy per capita, right? So right now all of us have the equivalent of, of just from our home when we go home and our plugs, 50 servants, that's the energy equivalent 50 servants. And that doesn't say anything about your transportation or whatever. So once a species gets to the point where the per capita energy use becomes more than one individual's worth per individual, that's when you're going to start feeding back. So that, that's the only assumption. If they start doing that, then they sort of fall into the category that I'm interested in. And then he got, I don't really care about sociology or whether they develop a no sphere or not. Maybe they do, maybe they don't. It's just that they're harvesting energy to do the work of building their civilization.

Speaker 5:          00:56:27       Yeah. So do you think that the current home where basically as a matter of marketing that we have the tools, sort of the guidance, the, there'll be neat to get through it if we all just somehow add it together?

Speaker 1:          00:56:40       Yeah, I think that's, you know, there was, I was just reading recently about a study that sort of showed a super detailed study that you could actually power, you know, the world with renewables, with wind, water, you know, but the thing, but you know, it's always a really detailed plan for doing it. Of course it required this, you know, sort of, you know, World War Two Manhattan style project for the entire world. And so that's going to be hard. But in terms of like technologically, man, unleash the innovation, let us, that's one of this, you know, when I go out and I'm talking to people, one things I'm saying is like, you know, on one level climate change shows how awesome we are, right? I mean, you know, we've changed the atmosphere of an entire planet. That's pretty good for a bunch of hair hairless monkeys, you know?

Speaker 1:          00:57:17       Um, and now the question is, are we smart enough to innovate our way into some kind of sustainable version of it? So it's, you know, so it's not just marketing though. It's deeper than that. It's myth, right? Human beings always need stories. I don't, you know, somebody said, you know, stories where the first technology and the problem is here, we have all of these from the, you know, long history of humanity. We have these myths about the coming of age, about marriage, about old age. Um, uh, but we don't have any. And we have creation myths. But climate change, we don't have a myth for, because it's new. We've never done this before. And so what I'm suggesting is, is that, you know, a first, it's not like this alone is gonna solve anything, but if we don't change the narrative, we are stuck arguing with people about whether we change the climate or not. From this perspective, that question just disappears. It's like, of course you change the climate. You built a civilization that consumes a quarter of the entire biospheres productive capacity, you know, what did you expect? So I think it just, you know, one of the things in revolutions in scientific revolutions that happen is that the old questions, when you go through a paradigm shift, it's not that the old questions are answered, the whole question just don't even become meaningful anymore. People ask a new set of questions and that's at least what I'm proposing with this.

Speaker 4:          00:58:24       Yeah. This might try it a little bit more philosophical, although they're clearly philosophical ideas. Yeah. Um, you mentioned that you're an optimist. And piggy backing on the question about marketing, I'm sort of, my worry is that there is not in fact present in human thinking, the idea that humanity is in fact a single species. Yeah. We can sort of think about this as a collaborator, as a truly collaborative project. And I think one way to be pessimistic about this as to worry about factum minimization and whatnot. Do you have thoughts that make you more optimistic on that? Is it sort of, and I'm not saying that blind faith would be unreasonable perhaps. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:59:13       Yeah. I mean it's gotten us through a lot. Um, but no, actually, so, so I think when you look across species, you know, I know I feel confident in my bones that there've been other civilizations, right? You know, scientifically I can only go forward the probabilities that this has happened before. And what I imagine is the ones that make it have either the evolutionary background to have the right kinds of behaviors, maybe, maybe hive minds much easier if you're a hive mind to make it through this then if you're a, the kind of thing that we are. But the other possibility is that, you know, you evolve under pressure, right? Selective pressure is what determines a evolution. And you know, perhaps this is the agent by which we start to, uh, create new behaviors. You know, the Paris accord was weak, but the Paris accord was also remarkable in those sense that we've got every country to sign this thing.

Speaker 1:          01:00:02       So that was the beginning and then we took a step back. Um, but you know, so I think, you know, this is this May, the cl, you know, the anthropocenes maybe the agent for some kinds of species, perhaps like ours, to develop new evolutionary behaviors that allow them to get through and everything. You make it through. You know, it's weird like, Hey, if I put my hat on as a dad, I'm like, Oh my God, we've got to make it through. But if I put my hat on as an astronomer, I'm like, yes, I'll make it through some don't, you know? Yeah. Nothing special about us. Okay. All right. Well, thank you very much. Uh, I really appreciate you guys
