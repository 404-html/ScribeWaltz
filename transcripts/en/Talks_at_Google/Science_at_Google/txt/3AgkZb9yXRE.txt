Speaker 1:          00:06          [inaudible].

Speaker 2:          00:10          I hooks, my name is Steve Jobs are, and this is my colleague Franz Pretorius. We are the authors of the little book of black holes, which is really hot off the process and there's some copies over there. I hope there's a few left and we'll be sticking around to assign a, if you want to, um, a version of that sign. Um, so our book is about black holes and about Einstein's theories of special and general relativity. And what I wanted to do to start is to talk about how time behaves in special relativity because when we get to general relativity and black holes, it'll help us a lot to a warmed up with on the way special relativity works. So, so let's just do a first demo, which I have to admit as a bit of a fake, um, these, uh, stop watching as if they were accurate to a femto. Second will be just right for this Devin download, but, but somehow I couldn't get hold of the, the more accurate ones. Anyway, so we're going to do the twin paradox. I this normally understood I ain't going to run across the room and come back. Well France stay still and we're going to each one of our stopwatch starting on three, one, two, three, like this. That's what constant velocity, more or less book shit.

Speaker 2:          01:30          Uh, I have seven seconds, six seconds time dilation. I managed to have less time. Alas, I say just kidding because the actual difference between our times was approximately one, femto second. I'm actually now younger than frons by about a femtosecond. And so we commute into New York City. We actually gain a little bit more youth or if you maintain a regimen of jogging every day, it does actually keep you slightly younger. Uh, so let's just see this same thing. I'm in an animation I've got, um, now, uh, me, I suppose running the other way across the stage. Go for it. Go for, um, holding a stopwatch, and then I accelerated to run backward. Meanwhile, I've got frons with a fictitious Fred Fred here. Um, and I suppose that I go for a full 60 seconds, but you can see here I've, I've, um, arrange things so that I'm moving really fast, which I can in the demo, I'm, I'm, I'm moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light.

Speaker 2:          02:41          And so my clock really does run significantly slower. You can really, you can really see it now on the first thing that people tend to say when they see the twin paradox is if, if motion is really relative the way Einstein taught us, why can't we look at it another way? Let's go to the next, um, the next animation. Why can't we look at it this way? Go ahead. Where I consider myself to be stationary and I consider France to the one who was moving back and forth, why can't we look at it that way? If motion is relative and the answer is yes, motion is relative, but acceleration is something real. Because when I got to the end of the room, I had to actually work at it to turn around and come back while as while I'm actually moving at a constant velocity.

Speaker 2:          03:37          Okay. If I were like frictionless or something like that, I could just coast. Um, and, and my, my motion would be than physically equivalent to standing still. So it's really the acceleration which distinguishes between me, the, the guy who's clocked run slow and, and frauds who's clock runs at the normal time. This, this is wall time, namely the time that some distant observer would, uh, would, would, would perceive, okay. So, so let's understand a little bit more of the physics of why time has to do this. And the claim is that if you, if you think about it just right, you can not only see that time must run slower for the accelerating observer, you can even derive one of the main formulas or special relativity. So let's, let's now think about this, this particular demo or animation where instead of an ordinary stopwatch, fronds and I are going to carry little photon clocks and we measure the way time passes according to how many times the photon goes up and down and up and down.

Speaker 2:          04:47          And so for the moment I've got a stopwatch also so that you can compare it and see that these are two equivalent ways of measuring time. Only the stopwatch, you know, this, this stopwatch, who knows how that works in might have gears or something. The way this photon would clock works is actually closely related to the way atomic clocks work. So it, so it really is sort of physically transparent and so far we're not having me orphans move at all. But now let's see indeed what happens if I do my little dance of running across the stage with my photon clock. Uh, and the claim is that my photon clock does get out of sync with bronzes. As you saw, the photon is going up and down more slowly. What's transparent about that? Well, let's look at two more animations that I hope it will become clear.

Speaker 2:          05:38          I'm now going to trace the path of the photon as it goes. And once you can notice, if you sort of look closely, is that the overall velocity of the Photon, the overall speed is actually constant. It changes its direction of lost the changes direction. And goes across and back and so forth, but it's, it's speed is constant. It's always a speed of light, and as the same speed that fronds is, photon experience was going up and down, but Rhonda Proton makes it up and down more times because all it's doing is going up and down, whereas my photon has to do the left right motion too. And so that keeps it from going up and down. It's been at times. The point is that encapsulates time dilation, because time is nothing more than how many times the photon goes up and down. Nothing more or less.

Speaker 2:          06:33          So if we buy into that and we bind to that picture, like I said, we can actually derive one of the main equations of special relativity. Let's see it in the demo. Now I'm just going to move across stage in a, oops, we've got a little, sorry, I forgot to reset my phone. This is the sin of using global variables when you should use local because the path, is it a global variable? Okay, nevermind. I'm a physicist, not a computer scientist, so I write sloppy code. Anyway. Here's the photon. Doing what an odd to do, following me going across the stage. And I decided to have a similar trajectory where I do not accelerate. I just run in cost, block the across the stage on. And as a result, the photons trajectory, my photons from directory is straight and it follows the hypotenuse of a right triangle.

Speaker 2:          07:32          It has a right word component where it's going in and out of Velocity v which is my velocity when any cross the stage, obviously somewhat less than the speed of light. Although in this illustration I made it actually nearly this because I'm like, uh, and then, and then there's a downward component of the photons motions, which I defined to be c times that time tau that I perceive as a lapsing. This is the crucial point that I define my time, my proper time in terms of how much distance the photon managers to track in my own friend. Uh, and that's why this side of the right triangle is the speed of light times tau on and, and now we get to the point where we can do just a little bit of math and come to the punchline. I say the Tigers, the CRM says the sum of the squares and the two sides of the right triangle equals the square, the high pod news.

Speaker 2:          08:28          Now this unknown mysterious thing was my proper time. We can solve this with taggers equation for my proper time. And you get the time dilation equation just as Einstein derived at in 1905. So the point that I'd like to make here, the takeaway message is that special relativity is simple. Once you make the one assumption that the speed of light is the same in all frames as measured by any observer provided, they're moving at a constant velocity. But relative to other observers, once you make that one assumption, just ordinary plain geometry is sufficient to derive pretty much the whole subject. Um, and so for instance, in our book, one of the things we do with a very similar setup like a photon clock set up is we explain how to derive equals mc squared with similar logic. Now obviously you can't do that all with plain geometry because there's a little bit of physics and telling you what he is and what em is and so forth. But if you, if you just follow your nose in understanding what the physics concepts are, then a little bit of plane geometry is enough to, to get even into the main depth of special relativity. But general relativity is quite a bit different. And I'm going to turn it over to France to have a first go at that.

Speaker 3:          09:54          Okay. All right. So now that we want to sort of ancient need the goalies to explain with black holes are, um, and the, the solution that the black or solutions that were first discovered by swatch. So very soon after Einstein discovered a January activity. That's surprisingly simple. The geometry is so incredibly beautiful and simple. Um, but what it implies is very bizarre and very confusing. In fact, Einstein did not accept a lot of the aspects of those solutions. He never believed in black holes even until the day he died in, in the, in 1955. Um, so that Steve introduced one aspect of special relativity time dilation. So relative motion introduces a sort of a or observers perceived different time based on relative motion. So I'm going to explain one aspect or described black holes from the perspective of time violation. So now we have to go to general activity.

Speaker 3:          10:47          Uh, uh, and what is new about generativity? So as special activity, it's a theory about space and time or space time. But where is in special activity? Space Time is flat. It's given by this Fingal them in calcium metric. Now in January, the tivity spacetime can be curved and it can be dynamical. And what produces curvature in space time is matter and energy. So for example, this cartoonish picture of, of the earth, I mean the earth has a lot of matter. It's, it's a very heavy object. Um, and so in, in general activity, earth is cooling space, time around it. And we sort of representing it here with this, imagine the curvature of space, time to be the surface. And so you can sort of imagine that the earth is denning and so the, the earth producers curvature in space and time. Um, one aspect of that curvature, sort of connecting to the time dilation is curvature producer's time, dilation regardless of relative motion, something special relativity.

Speaker 3:          11:41          When we were moving relative to each other that we perceive time dilation. But now what the earth is doing is if you had a clock that someone, they're just sitting there on the surface of the earth like we are and someone very, very far away the clocks near the surface of the earth. We're run a little bit slower due to the curvature of space time. Um, okay. So we're going to use this ideal that they've curvature introduces time donations to get two black holes. You can go to the next slide. So to one, as I mentioned in general activity, it's matter and energy that produces curvature to produce more curvature. The theory says you need to take a certain amount of matter and energy and make it as dense, denser, and denser, more compact, and you'll produce more curvature. So let's sort of take again, the same idea of no till characterizing curvature by this sort of denting the surface and just take a now a story or say, imagine the sun because the sun is much, much more massive than the earth.

Speaker 3:          12:36          Um, that 10 to the 32 kilograms and it's about a, about a million kilometers across. Now of course, at the surface of the sun, there's quite a bit more curvature and so, but more time violation than you're at the surface of the earth. But now our tail activity says if we could somehow compress the sun down to a much smaller radius, so where the surface used to be, it will be exactly the same. But now we're taking all the spatter energy, compressing it into a much smaller volume. And so now if we get closer to that higher curvature region, there's going to be more time dilation and this sort of what the sequence is showing. Um, now a star like the sun, when it uses up all of its nuclear fuel, it's eventually going to go supernova. And the core, the remnant is going to collapse to something called a white dwarf, which is almost as massive as as the sun.

Speaker 3:          13:21          Um, but now it's much more compressed. It's about the size of the few thousand kilometers across. So of course, near the surface of the white wolf, there's going to be a quite a lot of time dilation, a lot of curvature. Um, and now we can say, oh, can we go further? How am I, how much time dilation in principle could we get all four styles that are perhaps 10 times the mass of the sun when they go through their nuclear burning phase? A, they sort of, they lose all of the energy, do prevent, uh, you know, to hold them up against gravity. And when they collapsed down, they won't collapse down into a white dwarf, but to a neutron store, uh, which is an incredibly dense object. Again, these things weigh, you know, round the mass of the sun. But in typical neutron star might be 10 to 20 kilometers in radius.

Speaker 3:          14:04          So something the mass of the sun, you know, compress down to something the size of Manhattan. It's almost absurdly deigns to think about it. Now for neutron stars, the curvature is so strong near the surface of the time. Dilation becomes, you know, significant things that we can easily think about. It might be a factor of 20 to 30%. So if you were on the surface of the nutrients story or clock would run slower by you know, 20 to 30% compared to someone that's far away. As I say, Oh, let's go further it, we don't think that there's a form of matter that sort of more dense the nutrients Oswald supposedly supposedly could contract a neutron story even further. Um, like what this image is suggesting is that the more we can sort of more we pressurize it, the stronger curvature becomes 60 old. Can we compress it down to a kilometer?

Speaker 3:          14:51          Can we compress it down to the same team leader? So the curvature becomes very, very large and the time dilation can become an arbitrary large factor. And the answer is no. You relativity something very, very interesting happens when you try to compress it to within what's called the swatch sold radius of the object. So for something like the size of the mass of the sun, that's about a radius of three kilometers or them diameter of six kilometers. So if you to try to take all of that matter and compress it down, when it reaches to a point of that, that swatch total radius, this character of space time starts to change. And spacetime undergoes what's called gravitational collapse. And surprisingly at that surface, which isn't really a surface, it's a place in space time. So, and think of it as a surface. Um, it's, we define it as a surface. It's a sphere of a certain radius there at a time. Dilation goes to infinity. So if you were at that finite radius, your clock would stop relative to an observers that infinity. Um, and, but, uh, you know, if you imagined, try to compare some new that actually it's a bit of a misnomer to think that time is actually stopping, but spacetime is really changing character. The matter collapses, collapses down to a singularity and that's a black hole. So now you can explain,

Speaker 2:          16:07          well let me, uh, let me use a couple of my simple demos to reinforce what friends are saying about time, dilation, elation. And what I've got here first is an illustration of how time runs at different elevations and a shoretel geometry. And this is even relevant right here in this building. Let's watch it again. You see that my clock being relatively high up in the Schwartzwald geometry runs faster because I'm experiencing less gravitational redshift and francaise runs slower. But the Schwartz, you'll geometry is really all around us. It is an excellent approximation of the space time geometry that we experience above the surface of the earth. So if this is fronds on the first floor of this building and here we are on the 10th floor, then it really is true that our clock runs a little faster. In other words, the people on the 10th floor, it can get more work done in the day, but the price is the age quicker in the process.

Speaker 2:          17:19          No free lunches. And you see now wall clock time here is arbitrarily distant observer and the suction observers clock runs even faster than mine. After all, I am still fairly close to the horizon and I, you know, everything is, is so simple just because I'm not up to drawing these beautiful funnel shapes for firstborn child, but it's a otherwise, it's actually an mathematically accurate depiction of the [inaudible], um, metric. Now let's have one more thought experiment where frauds and I start at the same elevation in the Schwartzel geometry and I jump, but we're assuming that I'm a tremendously good jumper. So even though I'm close to the black hole horizon, I can still do it and move up at nearly the speed of light and then I come back down and, and, and land. Okay, so, so now a striking feature is that my clock has gone through more ticks than Francis. And if you remember that the twin paradox that we started with, I might seem very odd because when we did the twin paradox, the accelerated observed accelerating observer, namely me, the guy you ran across the stage and back was the one who had fewer ticks on his clock. But now it's, it seems like it's the accelerating observer

Speaker 2:          18:46          and who has more ticks on his clock that is the secret to Anon, none of their pill. Another pillar of relativity theory, which is that the natural motion of objects is the path that maximizes the time elapsed for that object. So actually frauds in this animation is doing a very unnatural thing. He somehow hovering at a fixed elevation in a block of old geometry. So we have to have like a rocket ship or asked me standing on some surface. It's very unnatural. Whereas I can just boost off. And then for the entire duration of the animation, I am following a perfectly ballistic trajectory with no force at all. So most properly, I should think of myself as the free falling observer and France as you know, the, the less natural observer who, who manages therefore it is to stay younger. Okay. And just for entertainment, I modify this demo.

Speaker 4:          19:52          Well, uh,

Speaker 2:          19:55          well where did they come upstairs so that I would not stop when I got back down to francaise level. Um, let's just say I keep going toward the horizon. Okay. So, oh, what's happening there? Something extreme happen there. Let's make sure it's really clear on the screen.

Speaker 4:          20:16          MMM.

Speaker 2:          20:19          Time dilation. Got extremely intense. See, my clock is running and running and running and I got more texts on my clock, but now it's consoling down tremendously. And this is because I'm getting close to the black hole horizon and my gravitational red shift becomes extreme. Okay. So then just explain a little bit about what I mentioned before. Um,

Speaker 3:          20:48          with the character of space time changes completely ones as gravitational collapse happens. So what I mean by that is outside a black hole, like this spacetime is what's called static. Um, so the pretty the, there's a strong curvature but it's not changing with time. And in particular a w one way to describe it, if you some distance away from the black hole, you just experienced the same curvature. And so let's measure distance by radius from the black hole. So the swatch total radius, that's they've enterprise and see again for something the size of the sun that will be the radius would be about three kilometers, three the mass of the sun. So if you some distance away, yeah, you experience strong curvature but the space time doesn't change at all. Now if you approach the horizon and then when you cross it spacetime changes character completely inputting in particular what you thought of as this distance radius and what you thought of as time.

Speaker 3:          21:42          The time coordinated completely flipped character, they completely switched roles. And so as you cross the horizon, spacetime suddenly becomes intrinsically dynamical and all of space space and time is being swept down to the singularity or are equal zero. And what sort of alarming about that? Well, first of all, and that, that's also one way to think of why the, the, this, the surface of swa shoulder, eight way this, uh, this sort of area of the swatch or radius is nearby winterize and you can ever go back is if we passed you date while you can't go faster than the speed of light. Or another way of saying that is you only go forwards in time is a natural direction, which is forwards and time. And you can't go backwards in time. So moving to like, let's say there's a black hole over here, um, you know, I'm, I've read our books, I know you shouldn't cross the horizon, but somehow accidentally wandering across the horizon.

Speaker 3:          22:33          And again, the horizon isn't like a solid surface. It's really just this point in space time. And so like, oh dear, what's happened? Well, I've gone from larger radius to smaller radius crossing the horizon and I'm going forwards in time. And now I've said suddenly when you inside the horizon, radius is actually measuring time. And so by continuity, the forward direction in time is going to smaller radius. So suddenly once you're inside spacetime has become dynamical in this flow of space. Time is taking from larger to smaller radius. So now I panic because I heard that there's a singularity inside the back. One Sec. How can I get out or getting out means you want to go to a larger radius again but you can because that would mean going backwards in time. And so you do right so big because of the nature of time.

Speaker 3:          23:17          You can't escape the horizon. We going out with the why. Why are you doing? What's bad about being caught up in this flow? Well there's a singularity in the geometry at what was or equal zero. They're sort of the origin. And again when you're outside the black hole you can say okay our equal zero lets aware I can avoid it. But now you've crossover and suddenly it's like okay where's the singularity? What can I do to avoid it? Which directions? Right accelerating. But that's the wrong question anymore because our doesn't measure radial distance anymore. It measures time. And so the right question is when is the singularity and the answer? It's in your future. So you can't avoid it. And in fact it doesn't matter the guy. So it doesn't matter which direction you accelerating, you're going to get to the singularity. And in fact, uh, did this, this, this principle that Steve mentioned that the natural path sort of, you maximize the time that you take.

Speaker 3:          24:10          So if you want to survive for as long as possible, just let go. Just relax and free, fall into the singularity. Don't accelerate. Okay. But um, let me just also just mention, this also tells us why the singularity is such a bad thing because this, our coordinate that outside is radius inside this time serves two purposes. One is it also tells you what the area of us of a sphere is of that particular radius, right? So it gives you some sense of how low, how large spaces in a certain radius. And it's the same outside and inside. So inside it's also measuring the area of a sphere. So now you cross the black hole, you're at a certain radius. But now time going forward means radius decrease. So that means space is really collapsing down to a point. And even worse, what was time outside is now it's an hour coordinate that represents distance and that distance is being stretched out.

Speaker 3:          25:06          So this radius, uh, there's the area of a sphere of being squashed down to zero and the radius diverges. So this is the sort of spaghetti buying singularity just by the nature of space and time, everything gets stretched and squeezed into an infinitely thin line. So very, very, very bad place. Okay. So now with, with all of that description, you know, you say, I that sounds bizarre, it sounds kind of ridiculous and that's perhaps why people like Einstein ever really bothered to take this aspect of the swatch old solution. Seriously. You know, he accepted that at describes things far outside of bodies like the earth, but the material in the earth means that inside it's not the swatch or solution, it's something different, which is perfectly fine. Um, so he, you know, he didn't really spend too much time thinking about and dismissed or doesn't physical.

Speaker 3:          25:56          But then over the last, you know, 40, 50 years essentially starting in the sixties and seventies, um, you know, through a combination of theory and astronomy observations, we started to think that they actually are these things out there that black holes actually might exist in the universe that says it. But I mean, as I've just explained, there's a very bizarre predictions. So you want to say if we're going to say that there really is something so bizarre happening out there, that there's someplace out there with this gravitational collapse is happening with time completely flips, flips on its head and drags everything down to a singularity, you know, to paraphrase call sake. And it's an extraordinary claim. We need extraordinary evidence. So you can go to the next slide. Well, what evidence do we have? And I say until a couple of years ago in Lego made their historic discovery, which we'll talk about a little bit later.

Speaker 3:          26:46          Um, I say the evidence was getting very, very strong, but it was all circumstantial. And you're a couple of examples of the, the, the good evidence that there was, but circumstantial. Um, this is a picture of looking towards the dynamical central of our galaxy. So it's about 30,000 light years away. And so this is, it's a very small frame of you, just probably a fraction of the Lightyear across. Um, and this is showing that astronomers are these bright objects here or stores. Um, and so it's showing an extraordinary, over the past 20 years I've been tracking the positions of these, of these stores. And you can see, well they, they're orbiting what looks like the dynamical centre of our galaxy, but there's nothing there. So they, they're Aubrey, there's obviously something that's keeping them in orbit. And if you just apply Kepler's laws, you can deduce that there must be something there.

Speaker 3:          27:36          It's 4.4 million times the mass of the sun. So they're just finishing so years something that's the mass of the sun. It's bright. But there is something that's 4 million times the mass of the sun and we don't see it. What could it possibly be? So that doesn't show it's a black hole. But if it were a black hole, that would be consistent because this, there's the radio for back all that larger whatever radius of about 12 million kilometers. So in the 30,000 light years away, it's going to be sub pixel size on that. That is another example of the good evidence has been gathering over the years is in the circle of stellar binary systems. So this is an artist's depiction of, uh, the store in orbit around the putative black hole. And again, similarly, there's what is observed is all the black hole is and observed, but this story is observed.

Speaker 3:          28:27          And so this stories like wobbling back and forth in, you know, with time, but it's companion isn't seen. And again, you can apply Kepler's laws and for these stellar mass black holes in many candidates where it's inferred that the companion is, you know, 10, 15, 20 times the mass of the sun. And again, the puzzle, what could possibly be be that massive compose the ordinary matter and that we don't see it. So again, it's a proof that it's a black hole, but it's consistent. If it were a black hole, that's exactly what we did, what it would look like. So I think, you know, over the years the evidence has been gathering, but as you can see, it's circumstantial. We're not seeing the black hole, we seeing the effects of the black hole and surrounding stars or, or the story in this case. He's now. Now that all changed, you know, a couple of years ago and now you've probably all seen this IOP.

Speaker 3:          29:15          But this is the, this in fact, this was the first gravitational waves detected by the LIGO collaboration, um, that represents the inspiral and merger of two black holes. So just to sort of briefly, so stars can be in binary stars can collapse. We think two black holes, black holes can be in binaries. So two black holes can be orbiting each other. Uh, if it's, uh, if you have a single isolated black hole, is it like from outside it's a static space time. Nothing happens. But if you tap two black holes in Olberding, you've essentially got masses in energies. It's accelerating. And generativity says that when that happens, you can actually produce gravitational waves, which are these ripples in the geometry of space that propagate output at the speed of light. So two black holes in orbit are producing gravitational waves, but that's carrying away energy from the system.

Speaker 3:          30:05          And so the way that that reacts, but back on the binaries that they spiral in. So the system is losing energy to gravitational waves to closer to the gate. The fast they start to spiral, the more they emit. So sort of a runaway process initially it starts out very, very slowly. So these black holes, poly started, you know, formed a buy a new billions of years before they merged, but it slowly ramps up and, and then it's a runaway process. And we've seen the last few orbits of the life of this binary as a two black holes orbit spiraling to each other and form a larger black hole. Why this in terms of like showing that this is, that calls, why it's different, sort of qualitatively different from before. I said before were circumstantial because we've seen other things, we've seen photons and inferring their black holes.

Speaker 3:          30:49          But here there's this patent that the structure of the waves is really coming from the world emotional space time about these horizons of a black hole. So it's really telling us what geometry is doing in the vicinity of the horizons. Of course, it can't tell us what's going on inside. So that's always going to be a mystery if relativities right. Nothing can escape the black or not live in inflammation in gravitational waves. But at least up until these new, from outside toward, towards this point, we've gravitational collapse is presumably happening. This is really a signature of what space time is doing. Right, right, right. At that point. So I'll briefly, um, just in words, describe what, what gravitational waves are and how we, how Lygo actually detected them. So again, the, the ripples in the geometry of space and time and they propagate outwards and one property of their best safe.

Speaker 3:          31:41          Imagine a gravitational wave. There's sort of moving directly into the screen. Um, it's changing distances because it's a, it's a ripple in geometry. Um, but it changes distances in a very particular way. So there are protocol two polarizations one polarization. If the gravitational wave is moving yet one instant, it will stretch the screen in a horizontal direction while simultaneously squeezing it in the vertical direction. And as a cycle happens, it will oscillate back, back and forth. So stretching and squeezing in what's called the plastic configuration, you know, sort of just by the geometry. Now the polarization is called the cross polarization and says, rotated by 45 degrees. So the key thing is, as the gravitational wave propagates, transfers to the direction of propagation as inducing this oscillatory change in distance and sort of measure of gravitational wave, we want to measure changes in distance as we want to construct a ruler. It turns out that it's an incredibly sensitive or that we have to construct. And that's what Lygo has been doing over the last, since the 60s. It was planned, it's been under con funding and construction since the 90s. Think now, Steve is going to demonstrate that.

Speaker 2:          32:50          Okay. So first let's see it, um, worth yet one more animation where what I've done is I've taken a picture of an interferometer directly from the Ligo collaboration. I think this will play better. Change the size. Okay, let's see how this goes. Um, so, so first I want to show this plus pattern of gravitational radiation, what it would do to this device that I'm showing on the screen if it hits the screen justice fronds described. So it's stretching and squeezing the device itself. And I tried to animate it in such a way that that beam splitter in the middle stays more or less stationary, but you know what we mean by stationary and a dynamical space time is a little bit up for grabs anyway. What we, we definitely can't know is what is the relative length of the two long arms of the interferometer.

Speaker 2:          33:56          And the way we measure it is we have some laser here which shoots coherent photons. Half of them go through the beam splitter straight on and half of them go the other way. But it's a quantum phenomenon. So really every photon explorers both paths the photons bounce back off the mirrors and they recombine at the beam splitter, each photon recombined with itself. Because remember it explored both paths and depending on whether those paths are exactly the same length or slightly different lengths, the photon might either reinforce itself or cancel itself out as it traveled on to the readout device. And, and so we have, we have a little demonstration scale model of Lego, which is really working just as I showed, let's get house lights down a little bit on this is a little bit dim. And the reason it's dim is that we're using a teeny weeny little laser like a laser pointer.

Speaker 2:          35:06          We have bigger lasers or more powerful lasers in the physics department, but they wouldn't let me take one, uh, to New York City cause you know, walk through Penn station with one of those things and you're really taking your chances. Okay. So, um, so you see the, these, these stripes are drifting down the screen. The reason that's happening is the whole device is warming up a little bit. And so all the angles and so forth are just changing very, very slowly. And it has nothing to do really with the main physics. Dylan straight the main physics first let me block one beam. So if I blocked one beam, you see the stripey pattern has gone and what's left is just some dim pattern with a little bit of features and such, which, which are only have to do with the particular optical devices that I have in here.

Speaker 2:          35:52          So you know, any flaw in the mirror will show up as a little feature on the, on the screen. So if I, if I blocked the other beam, you can see again, the pattern goes away. It's only when the two beams recombine that you get this quantum year interference between the two just as I described. And then it's thrown up on the screen where the d focusing lens. Okay. So now that the thermal expansion has pretty much settled down, if I juggle this thing in any way, you can see that it, that the, uh, interference pattern responds a lot. And, and the reason that it's responding is that just a light touch on the base is causing the relative weight of these two arms, this one and this one too, to change by just enough like micron sizes enough in order for the interference pattern to shift by about one stripe.

Speaker 2:          36:49          So, you know, just a, a light tap is about enough to cause the interference pattern to tap, to shift by, by, uh, by one stripe. Whereas, but like it was really seeing is it seeing something that's more vibrational? Like if I do this, you can see it. It does ring a little bit. You can see these things like that. That is what logo is actually watching, except they watch it a heck of a lot better than we can watch it here with this easy, meaty little demonstration scale model. Um, I can measure differences in length of, of, of relative life in these, in these two arms, two about the micron scale. Uh, Lego with a four kilometer arms and similar light, although far more intense, is able to measure relative length differences that are less than the diameter of a proton. So it's an school is at least sensitive device. I still understand that quite honestly. Uh, exactly all the treks that allow them to measure things that are such small links that are so much smaller than the wavelength of light that they're using. Um, so it's, it's quite an achievement that that, as Ron's mentioned, was decades in the making. Um, and there are certainly more games we could play with this device. But let's, let's save it until afterward. And, and uh, go back to the question of what are these gravitational waves and how's the black hole really producing? Okay.

Speaker 3:          38:15          Right. So it's setting the, the next thing would just be an animation or

Speaker 2:          38:21          sort of what it, is that what I described.

Speaker 3:          38:26          So this is a computer simulation of two black holes merging in there. These are parameters that are similar to the first event that was detected. The so you can play it. So these are two black holes. They're orbiting each other. He sort of green, uh, sort of this haze is going out. This is a representation of the gravitational waves. And so what you'll notice is as they're orbiting, the amplitude is increasing. So that's because they actually slowly spiraling in runaway. The closer that they getting the fast are they starting to move? The more energy they mud. And eventually it gets brighter and brighter and they, they coalesce. When two black holes meet, they form a larger black hole. And then you see this little burst of radiation at the end. And what's left you the sort of this perfectly stationary, uh, rotating black hole. Um, now what, what things do, we did a lot of things that are fascinating about this one event.

Speaker 3:          39:18          Um, again, it represented, this is another depiction of the way form. So it represented sort of from the way that Lego saw that will patent, we can infer the properties of the, the black holes. They were both about 30 times. The mass of the sun. One's a little bit bigger than the other one. Um, does he slowed down tremendously. But we, in real time, and Steve will show a demo, which sort of almost demonstrates at least in a second, but if they read real realtime, they go and get the fracture, the sizable fraction of the speed of light, 20, 30 times the speed of light. And this scale is, uh, is about a thousand kilometers for those things. So that's incredibly fast. And what's perhaps more astonishing is the energy that's released in this final final burst. Um, so it happens in a few milliseconds. This final boost that you saw, um, I mean that one instant, if you just compute the, the, the energy and gravitational waves, uh, it's brighter than all the visible style out in the universe combined at one incident. That, that sounds like a ridiculous statement, but it's true. So in gravity and gravitational waves that outshines all the stars in the universe of that one incident, right. I think we're about out of time, one of, yeah, sure. That's right. So now I think, yeah. Okay. Uh, so

Speaker 2:          40:30          this last demo is, is aimed at showing you analogous mechanical system. Um, let's see if we've got this. No, I have to restart quick time. It always does this moment. So what I've got is a spinning disk which settles down to a stationary state. It's not really quite like a, not really quite like a black hole merging of course with another black hole, but it's in the same spirit because for starters it's, it's exhibiting similar frequencies of output. Now for similar reasons.

Speaker 1:          41:20          No,

Speaker 2:          41:23          it looks like I'm not going to have any cooperation here from quick time. One more try and then I get to go straight to the demo.

Speaker 4:          41:36          Okay. Recording. There we go. Nope.

Speaker 2:          41:56          All right. So this is nothing more than a spinning coin. It's called [inaudible] disk for no good reason. It's just a spinning coin. It's settling down and you can hear already that it has some characteristic frequencies. And what we've got over here on the right is a sound analyzer, which is picking up everything that this microphone hears. So, for instance, it's hearing my voice and if I use a tuning fork, you can get a peak. You see that about 128 hertz, let's Millie's eve. You can still see that peak. If I, if I stopped talking, you can see it better. There's disk. It takes a little while to settle down, but in its final stages, what I liked about it is that it's exhibiting the same behavior as merging black holes in that the point of contact is flipping around faster and faster and it's emitting, therefore a similar kind of Chirp only in sound that colliding black holes in it in gravitational radiation. And now I'll stop talking so you can see the wave form on the spectrum analyzer.

Speaker 2:          43:40          Okay. Dot. Chirp is very like the sound of two merging black holes. What's not so much like it is that you see many overtones here. You see some some down at about 30 hertz and then all the way up to a strong one at about a hundred to 150 that's because it's a dirty mechanical system. Just for contrast. Let's go back to one of Franzia sides and you can see one, a much more beautiful system. These swirling block holes are, um, let's show it. So this is what Lego saw. Their picture is tilted 90 degrees from mine. When you see this is the way form, there's the Chirp, same chirp that I saw, but there is no overtones because this is a very pure tone coming from the Claudia black holes. But at a rather similar frequency. You remember I was at about 150 hertz. Oh, there at about 150 hertz. So if you could hear the black hole merge, it would, it would sound kind of like that. So a great discovery. It really convinces us that black holes are in the universe. And I think that's a good place to stop for questions. Thank you. Thank you.

Speaker 1:          44:55          Okay.

Speaker 2:          45:01          I folks who have a mic here. Oh, there's no Mike set up. So if you have questions, I'll just pass this around.

Speaker 2:          45:13          So you told us that, uh, close to the event horizon, the time dilation time runs slower compared to, to an outside observer. Right? So essentially all the physical processes at the event horizon, car running slower, does that apply also to the contraction? Meaning ultimately do the black, does the black hole actually even form in the lifetime of the universe since the time is essentially slowing down to a stencil that point? Yeah. So there's a, there's a Australia's kind of answer to that, which is, it depends on who's clock you're talking about. When, when we, when we look from outside, as you know, there's always a wall clock observers. What we can definitely say is that once a black hole is formed, then from our perspective as outside observers, nothing manages to fall in. It all kind of settles down into the horizon, um, evermore gradually.

Speaker 2:          46:15          Um, but in terms of black holes really forming, that's a bit different because the gravitational collapse isn't complete until it's really happened. So, so I would say, I would say that in fact, yes, black holes really do form. Um, it's, it's best answered with, you know, with space time you have to draw something like a pen rose diagram and say that, that, that on any, on any respectable time slice, yes, there is a black hole that really has formed. It's just that the signals move so strangely in the block hole geometry that the distant observer can never see the signal from app or inside the horizon. So that's, that's the way I try to balance the two answers that, that yes, it happens, but you can never actually see the signal from the black hole because that's what a black hole is.

Speaker 5:          47:09          Hi. So you started with an explanation of how time dilation, uh, it depends more on acceleration than the actual philosophy of the Observer. But then when you got into the Pythagorean theorem explanation, that made perfect sense to me. If we were just thinking about velocity and ignoring acceleration, I, I got a little confused about which way I should be thinking in terms of changing velocity or a constant velocity and how that affects

Speaker 2:          47:29          the dilation. Yeah. The reason for this is that it feels, it feels more valid to compare clocks at the same place. So if I ran across the stage and it's not my clock over there, I could manage it with constant velocity, but then you might doubt that my notion of time over there was the same as the one over here. And so that's why I felt obliged to go there and then come back a couple of times to, to illustrate that there is something real going on here and that necessitates the acceleration. Um, but when we get to this business of actually deriving the formula, then it's a heck of a lot simpler, simpler to idealize and say, look, this consider a perfectly straight velocity. What I could've done to bridge the gap between the two is I could have said when I get across the room, then I turned back instantaneously and then I would have a perfectly, my photon will go down like this, like I showed, and then it would just go right back up. So I could manage it at the cost of infinite acceleration. And then my geometry would have been perfectly correct and I would still be able to measure at the time, but at the same point.

Speaker 4:          48:45          Yep. Um, so

Speaker 6:          48:52          when we look at like atomic theory and what Einstein and like Oppenheimer and guys were doing with

Speaker 4:          48:58          mmm.

Speaker 6:          48:59          Like atomics, right? We did something with that either creating the bomb or creating nuclear fusion reactors. You're talking about quantum mechanics and even Google's exploring using that for computation from an application and exploitation perspective. Has there been research into like what we might do with this as a species or something like that? Does that question make sense? The GPS answer? Yeah, you did. You mean with uh, black holes or with, with Caden relativity or gravitational waves? Yeah, gps is a good end.

Speaker 2:          49:34          Sure. Yeah. So, so, you know, gravitational positioning satellites are way up there and I'm in elevation and so high above the earth that the gravitational redshift who fact matter and in order to make gps work as well as it does to within a few feet, you have to have timing. And those satellites figured out really well too. I guess it's about the few nanosecond level. Um, so, and that's done with atomic clocks by the way. Um, but it was also done by understanding this fortunate metric on now as for a while, as for really practical applications of black holes per se. Well, maybe you should tell him about the Penrose process

Speaker 6:          50:25          [inaudible] that if we did

Speaker 3:          50:28          happen to have a black hole but came wandering nearby and didn't sort of run into us, um, in principle we could go, if it was rotating, we could go to that black hole and mine it for rotational energy. Um, and in something that's probably one of the most efficient forms of energy that we could get. Um, if you'd think like nuclear fusion, um, if you think it was like the rest Mesic Wilson of energy that you get from that, that's less than a percent or it's like a fraction of a percent. In theory, if you had a very rapidly rotating black hole, you could get upwards of almost 30% of its rest mass equivalent in energy extracted from it. So, for example, you'd be formed the black or the mass of the sun, there'd be a whole Solo Sun's worth equals MC squared of energy in that black hole. If it's rapid, the rotating about 30% of that can be extracted. Um, so I'm taking a third of the Sun Equals Mc squared and converting it to energy. Um, but yeah, that that will require us finding one of these black holes. And I mean they'd been, I was a science fiction and even Freeman Dyson had sort of imagined advanced civilizations powering themselves using back hauls.

Speaker 1:          51:39          Yeah.

Speaker 6:          51:45          So I have a kind of a weird question. Um, we, we were billions of light years away from this collision when it happened and so we detected it with this exquisite detector. Um, presumably if you were closer to it, I mean, if you were like hosted, what you'd be destroyed by this enormous energetic event. I, but there must be at some distance where you would feel it. What would it feel like?

Speaker 3:          52:11          That's a good gracious. All right. I can imagine you're going to be straight being stretched and squeezed and let, let's say if you're about a hundred times a swatch or radius on this thing away. So for this event, say you were at about 10 kilometers away, um, then the amplitude, the fractional change is going to be something like 10 to the minus three. So you might be stretched and squeezed by a few millimeters. So that's actually, I think you mean you feel it the few millimeters, like over the length of your bodies and too bad. The thing where I'm a bit more concerned about is a frequency is very high. So this thing that I could add a hundred hertz being stretched and squeezed it a hundred hertz, that might mess up with some things, but not for example. I mean, you probably hear it like it will, it will affect your eardrums. There'll be stretch and squeeze. So they'll probably be a thing. But I mean you'd, you'd feel it. It feels this very rapid vibration. Um, yeah. But the idea, you have to get very, very, very close to it. Thanks.

Speaker 6:          53:10          I my questions about the detection of gravitational waves. It seems like if you kind of rotated the instrument like 45, if you had it originally at the ideal angle and then you rotated 45 degrees, you wouldn't see it at all. Maybe. And also you were saying it like, like the time was very short, like if the machine had turned off for a millisecond, would you have just totally missed it? And how frequently to two rotating black holes collide? I guess like how lucky were they that they saw it or was it pretty likely that they would see something?

Speaker 3:          53:44          I think it was quite like, like one thing is we, we didn't know how frequently these black holes merge. This could happen. And it was actually a lot of doubts in the community had like, it would actually work. So there, there's a whole story about that that goes, you know, it goes back decades. Um, but you're right. But if it had hadn't been on at that time, we would have missed it. And presumably these things are happening. Um, pre, you know, galaxy the size of the milky way once every million years. And so that's why Lygo has to be sensitive enough to, at least in its, in its range sweep up at least about a million galaxies. So we have a chance of seeing like one per year, but those, those rates are uncertain. But you can imagine it was like hundreds of billions of galaxies in the universe. So every, every day there's several dozen or several hundreds of these mergers happening somewhere in the universe and the waves come, they cross you earth very, very rapidly.

Speaker 3:          54:32          So yeah, if, if I go isn't on winter, winter passes, we've, we've missed it. So I think, you know, the, the, I think we were still running at the time. I mean, I can take and talk about this for a lot if he'd worries, but they're there. It's a lot of things about this event that was very fortunate. The way that they're fed just turned the instruments on. They actually didn't think they were ready for a science run. Um, they didn't because of that. They didn't fail. It took him a long time to understand that it really was a signal. Someone thought they were playing a joke or hacking the system and it took them a long time to convince themselves and, and this was a real signal. And then just nature of being lucky, like we actually didn't expect such heavy black holes. We had no idea about the rates.

Speaker 3:          55:12          So there was a lot of like both from nature and the way they experiment work. So a quick answer to this business of being insensitive to the other polarization. You're quite right that if you've got only the cross polarization when you are ready for plus, then you wouldn't see it. Each detector in Ligo is sensitive to only one polarization. However, the signals that we can imagine have a mix of both polarization, both polarizations present and, and so you're going to see it, right? That's not a problem, right? So yes, the intensity is going to depend on the orientation, but you won't miss it completely because of that. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          55:50          So a question on that, right? How do we know these are actually like black holes of binary black hole system? And not like, you know, dilation of spacetime eater, like

Speaker 3:          56:01          no other explanation, right? It's because of the very particular shape of the wave form that there's this what steeple? The CHIRP, right? So that increases in amplitude reaches a maximum. And then the case that the exact shape is very characteristic of black holes. So the, yeah, if you want to play devil's advocate, you can say, well, is there something else in the universe that might produce this? And well, so far we don't know. Um, I'd say that there's nothing that we know of that could produce a signal like that. Another, another side of the question is, is it, could it be noise? Because you know, these things, they measuring distances, they incredibly sensitive. Um, so I mean, they, they, they can detect the tiniest earthquakes that happen anywhere in the world. Um, one example that they can detect just regular waves crashing on the ocean, on the oceans around the United States is incredibly sensitive instrument.

Speaker 3:          56:52          So you have to also make sure that that noise wasn't responsible for that. Um, and that is any, that's why they actually are two detectors. One in, uh, Hanford, Washington state, one in Louisiana, separated by a few thousand kilometers. And so one reason, well, one way that they can vet for noise sources is they have to see the same thing separated by it. Most delight crossing time. So you know, the, the, the, if the, if the gravitational waves that happen at a certain orientation, they'll see it instantaneously. The maximum time difference could be for first hits one and then travels and hits the other one. So the time that light, so I think 10 milliseconds or so. So it would be at some, some very good questions. And that these, this too, there's, this looks exactly like what we, where we solve the Einstein equations for backup emerges as it looks exactly like a black hole merger that they, yeah, those are things that need to be considered. Cool. Thank you. We are out of time. So let me

Speaker 1:          57:50          [inaudible].
