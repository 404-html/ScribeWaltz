Speaker 1:          00:00:08       So I would spend the next 30 minutes talking to you about my work in the last 12 years in neuroscientist and I leave some all afterwards, both for questions about how it translates to business, which is somewhat what I do right now, but also to a, what I call the inspiration part, where I tried to also tell you why I think it's a, not just a theoretical idea that you'd be done by labs, but also something that would be in your life in the coming years. Okay. So maybe I should start with something else. I tend to speak very fast, especially when I get excited. So I need someone from you from the front row to raise your hand every time it becomes too fast you think for yourself or for the audience. So everyone gets to raise their hand. But you may be channel everyone else with the beer.

Speaker 1:          00:01:04       Okay, so the point of my talk, I'm going to give it to me in the beginning and then I think we did at the end, is to suggest that our understanding of the brain has evolved in the last 10 years. And what it's brought to us is some new thinking about kind of our role in controlling our behavior. So whereas we used to think of the brain as the kind of equivalent of who we are as US equals our brain, we now have more understanding of the fact that maybe in your, there's more than one entity if you want living with you and governing your thoughts. And part of what we call our consciousness or us is a mechanism that comes and takes all the historical events in your memory and weaves them into a narrative. And what it does mostly is looking at the past and trying to kind of come up with a story that's coherent.

Speaker 1:          00:01:56       It can explain this behavior. And the reason it's important and not just a theoretical idea is because once we accepted this idea, we can actually go into your memory and change things and you will create a new narrative for yourself. And you will never questioned this understanding of who you are. And you would just walk in your day with different understandings of who you are. So what we call consciousness isn't just a Eh, how we tell our story isn't just what we call it. The tooth isn't, Eh, uh, experience of the reality that we go through. It's also a way for us to make sense of the world and in the context of both a psychology and business. When we tried to talk about changing behavior, many times we try to teach people and give them our information and think that if we just give them the right information, everything is going to be different.

Speaker 1:          00:02:46       They're going to understand and behave differently. And now we come up with a totally different idea of how we do that. We just changed something in your brain that leads you to just wake up with a different behavior than just to carry that forward and tell yourself a story that it was always what you it. So, Eh, in many ways this is not a trivial thing to understand that these three pounds, the team between our ears actually govern who we are in everything that we do. And they actually allow us to change someone's behavior by just changing small indicators in there. And where whereas I spend a lot of my time thinking about that. It's still hard for me to accept what I'm going to end the stock with, which is that if you learn to cope with your brain is something that drives things without you actually having a full understanding of why they happen.

Speaker 1:          00:03:37       But kind of explain it differently. You can actually change your behavior. Eh, the best analogy I found, it was one that I explained when I was a little kid that allowed me to kind of think about the world differently. So when I was a kid, I grew up in Israel in the early eighties and at the time computers were Sunni, expensive and queer games were very scars. So if you want it to play computer games, you would go to an arcade store when they had this big machine and you can play games. When I was a big fan of this game that some of you may be still familiar with it. You play this little Italian plumber below and you're trying to save the princess that this vicious goal kidnapped and Goya throws burns at you that you tried to dodge while climbing up. And I went to the arcade, stolen, played this game for roughly 30 seconds, doing a pretty good job.

Speaker 1:          00:04:26       So I managed to get to the second level and kind of, you know, dodge a few barrels. We went, suddenly two words appeared on the screen that changed my view of control and the two words were insert coin. And what it meant was that I wasn't playing the game at all. I was watching a video, a demo of the game playing itself, and I was just seeing it happening. But in my mind I was in control. So the movie was showing how the game goes and the character was moving up and down and jumping about barrels and so on. And I was actually moving a joystick, but there was no connection between the joystick and the movie. But in my mind that was, I was Sherman control. Now granted the intentions for the movie and my intentions were aligned so it made sense for me to try to go up when the character moved up to go left, when it went left to press the jump button.

Speaker 1:          00:05:12       Granted there probably were times where I tried to move right and it moved left or try to jump on. It didn't. But because for the most part the movie aligned with my intentions, I was able to them have a story that says that I'm in control and only when I was confronted with reality in a way that I couldn't really visit anymore. I said, okay, I guess I'm just watching a movie and the reason I'm telling you these stories, because this in my mind is the best analogy we have right now to how the brain and our consciousness work. Things happen to us, behaviors or cure. And we after the fact come back and own them claimed that we had agency and try to tell a story that made us do those things as if we want to do. And this is hard to accept.

Speaker 1:          00:05:54       I'm going to repeat that one more time towards the end, but that is the message of what we are listening right now. But the brain, which is for the most part things happen and we can explain them if you look at their brain, but we don't necessarily explain them well if we ask you. So if we ask you to tell us a story, you will come up with a story. If I ask you why you did what you did, you will always have an answer. But more and more we see that there was a misalignment between the answer that you give and what our brain tells us and sometimes even how you actually will expand your intentions. So this is a theoretical idea. However, there are by now a few ways for us to actually test it. So in one of the studies that we're running right now, it's based on a study that was done here in New York a few years ago.

Speaker 1:          00:06:32       We essentially are able to show people the gap between the moment that your brain made a choice in the moment you come to explain this choice. And we can show you that those are not necessarily aligned. And in fact we can change things and you will still defend your choice. So what we do in this study, we essentially bring people to the lab to make very basic choices that mean nothing to them but are continuous and repeated. So the idea is if you're a subject in the study would bring to elaborate, Eh, you will sit down and the guy in the back who was running the experiment will pull to do counts and he would ask you to make a choice. And the choice is a which of the two people you see here, you find more attractive. The guy on the left and the guy in the right.

Speaker 1:          00:07:14       So let's play it. We deal. Who Do you find more attractive? The guy on the left, the guy, the right, the guy in the left. Why smiling? So this is one trial at about 100 tries to this experiment. Let's say you're a subject. We showed you two cards. You make a choice. We give me card that shows you're holding in your hand and you say, I like this guy because he's smiling. Now you don't know any of them. They mean nothing to you. It's many, many choices at all are kind of arbitrarily. But you make them and you always have an answer. So if you did this, we put a new pair of cards again, had you make a decision, give the card experience, so on. So this is the experiment we off SPEC. They're very simple, but there's actually a twist here. It makes it more interesting because the guy in the back, the guy that gives you the card isn't just a regular guy.

Speaker 1:          00:07:57       He's a magician that we hired and he uses sleight of hands in one out of every say 20 trials to give you the code you didn't choose. So if you chose the guy on the left, he would give you the card with the guy on the right. And two interesting things happen in this experiment. First, people early. Notice people rarely say no. I chose this one and you gave me the other one that's already interesting. But what's more interesting is that when they get the card, they didn't speak, they go on and explain to us why this was their choice. So you chose a, I give you big, take me on your side, what would be because of so and so. Now I've got an it not going to work. If it was a significant important choice, I can't replace your wife or husband and you would not notice, I can't replace you know thing your career or your job.

Speaker 1:          00:08:43       But we're playing with more and more complex things and turns out we can expand and change. I don't have to think that people think they would never be able to explain differently. So we can change people's preferences on politics now and it works. So not really democratic public and vice versa, but on some new ones, choices like gun control in and they may be climate change. We can actually move you a little bit just by changing what you think you have chosen. And also we, we basically can can a used it in the context of business to show you how little you know about your business choices when it comes to marketing. So for example, you mentioned you go to the grocery store to buy a variety of things and you have like a shopping list and you go and you at some point get to the aisle with a toothpaste and you say, okay to the patient's important choice, I'm going to actually give this one a lot of attention and you look at the two options that you have there.

Speaker 1:          00:09:32       Let's say Colgate and crest and you say, okay, the one on the left is more expensive but this one is a big bigger and this one is mean you, but this one is whitening and you kind of make a table of all the things that you think are important. Then you make a choice, you put it in your basket and you go on shopping. If I'm going to go into your basket. At some point between the moment you made the choice and the moment you get to a checkout counter and they place the item with the other option, chances are that you won't notice this change, but not only that when you go inside, if I stuck around and I say, hey, there's a focus group, you want to know why you chose this versus that you got a competent answer and the reality is that it's very, very hard for us to accept the fact that memo is in our mind are not necessarily too, we're going to spend a lot of time protecting our memories.

Speaker 1:          00:10:12       In fact, there's a lot of discussion right now out there about a fake news and fake information and and people spend a lot of times challenging and being skeptical about things coming in from the outside. They say, I don't really trust this piece of information. I'm going to validate that they're going to argue against it. If it's something that we don't really like, we're going to spend a lot of mental effort trying to convince the person who gives it to us but they're wrong or that something is not right about the fact that we never ever challenged the fact that all of the inside, this is something that we protect. So if you leave this room right now, when you go have dinner with your friends tonight, and at some 0.1 of your friends said, oh, it was amazing what we did today. When you played tennis, it's 1:00 PM he said, no, no, no.

Speaker 1:          00:10:49       At 1:00 PM I was in a talk in my office and they say, no, no. At 1:00 PM we were playing tennis. You'd say, come on. I remember clearly I was in the soup. I can describe the wound to you. They're going to start showing you evidence of video of yourself playing tennis. 10 people that were there telling you we were, were you playing tennis? It's going to take a lot of effort for them to convince you that you weren't where you work, where you were because your mind is set to protect what it thinks is too. That is kind of an essential part of our reality. We don't challenge things that are already inside and in many ways this is what I'm going to argue is a, one of the different things we need to change right now, which is the fact that our brain isn't fully in control of what's going on, but also that the memos and the stories that we tell ourselves are coming up afterwards and aren't necessarily to, in fact, my students made this teacher that I liked and say, don't believe everything you think, which is kind of a joke, but also the message of today's talk, which is that somehow what's inside is not guaranteed.

Speaker 1:          00:11:40       Okay. Up to now, I kind of give you a philosophy. Let's talk a little bit more about practical thing we do with people. So we look at the brain and trying to understand how the brain actually encodes information and how thoughts get in Saudi and into the brain and it was stored and how we actually talk about that, and I assume I don't have to convince you too much that the brain is the seat of your thoughts and your behaviors, but we have more and more evidence right now from people whose brains change and with those changes, their personality change. The suggested actually really who we are is in our brain. So much so that it's stronger than what we think is us. I'll give you an example. You may be familiar with the story of a woman in San Diego in I think eight years ago roughly calling the police and saying, my husband I've been married to for the last 10 years became a pedophile.

Speaker 1:          00:12:31       I don't know what to do. I'm really worried about our four year old daughter. You've got to come and arrest my husband. And the police indeed come and they find child pornography on his computer and they arrest him and he goes to court. And as the trial begins, he complains about the headache and it's ignored. On the first day, you can go on the second day, on the third day, he has a seizure in the courthouse. So they pick him up and carry him quickly to the emergency room or on the wall. It just looked at his brain and what they see is a massive tumor pressing on the left front part of his brain that should have caused them also pain, but definitely risks his life. So they're setting straight from the emergency order, the operating room, where a surgeon will be more of the tumor in a complex surgery.

Speaker 1:          00:13:10       And then when he wakes up after 12 hours of surgery, he no longer has a tumor, but also he is no longer the file. It says, I don't know, happened to me. It was embarrassing and I'm ashamed that I'm guilty and I don't know to do with that. And he goes to court and in an unprecedented bowling to that point, the judge in his coat actually sends him back home and she writes in her ruling, Eh, that Eh, it wasn't his fault, it was his parents' fault, which kind of, you know, cause for philosophical idea of what the difference between me on your brain and this story is just one example of how changing your brain changes and personality. But actually it has a Twix typically a bit more interesting because 10 months later after the guy who was sent to the common probation, the wife calls a second time and says, my husband is a butterfly again.

Speaker 1:          00:13:53       Can you do something about it? And he's being taken again to the emergency room. We were looking at his brain and they say it's part of the tumors came back, but that's a side and it's pressing on the same area. And so he is going into a second procedure where they take it out a second time. And again it goes back to his normal behavior. So this is like a controlled experiment. You'll be able to one way you have it one way you change it to behave differently. And it was just one example out of many, many examples where right now to the fact that we can actually change your brain a little bit and even against your intentions, desires, you will become a different person in some aspects of your life and it will be hard for you to go back. Okay, so now that we kind of accepted that, the question is can we find who you are in your brain?

Speaker 1:          00:14:31       Can we change your personality and can we also tell you who you are? Even when you say no, I want the opposite or expanding your choices maybe even before you make them. So for a while, looking at the brain, Eh was done in one of two big ways. With animals, we can obviously look at the brain directly. We opened their brain, mice, rats, we stick electrodes inside our head and those electrodes are fine microphones that listened to the activity of a brain cells in a very, very accurate and precise way. And tell us basically what the person is or the animal is thinking about in a very, very direct way. That's the ultimate way to study the brain. Looking directly inside one we can do to animals. We conduct with humans, obvious reasons. So instead what we do with humans is we studied the brain from the outside using imaging techniques.

Speaker 1:          00:15:18       So we use big machines that inject magnetic fields all look at the activity from the outside and trying to infer a how the brain works for looking at the outside. If you were to somehow be able to poke inside the brain and see what's going on there, what you will see or is a forced of cells that look like these. And if you were to listen to them you would hear the sound of self speaking, which is essentially perfect. Okay. So if you were to translate the identical chemical activity of brain cells, how they speak to each other, you would hear this basically a electrical discharges of ions, of movement, of a sales. If you want to have ions from one cell to another. If you put a microphone next to them and it translated into audio, this is how it sounds. So those bursts of activity, those what we call it firing is the language of the brain.

Speaker 1:          00:16:11       Each cell when it speaks, speaks by changing his firing frequency from very low to very high. And if we can tell what happened in the real world while those cells were firing, we can actually decode what you're thinking about. So if every time I show you a picture of your mum, one cell fires, we would say that this collection indicates that this is part of a network of fellows. That code thinking about your mom. Okay? So this is how thoughts look in the brain. And this is where I also tell you that I lied to you a few minutes ago and now I'm going to be clear about what we do. So I told you that there was actually two ways out of the brain with animals. We can look inside and we do once we look at it outside, but my lab is part of a small group of lives, about five labs in the world could actually do what I just said was impossible, which was look at the brains of humans from the inside.

Speaker 1:          00:16:56       What we do is we open people's brains, we stick electrodes inside our head and we eavesdrop on the acuity of individual cells in the brain while they think while they're awake, when they're talking, trying to understand how it works. And I'm here to look for volunteers for this project. Eh, what we do is we work with patients who undergo brain surgery for clinical purposes and we piggyback on the clinical procedure to also study the brain for research purposes. So I'm going to show you now how it looks. If you don't like pictures of brains, this is and took away. I'm going to show it for a brief moment and then I'm gonna skip that. This is roughly how it looks.

Speaker 1:          00:17:35       Electrodes on the surface of the brain that are tiny enough to be able to decode the activity of individual cells in the brains of our patients. When we wrap it up and close it, it looks like that. So this is a, now you can look back if you look away, this is almost obvious. Patients come are patients typically have a brain disorder that they couldn't resolve in any other way and the last two years old so to speak is coming to a clinical procedure where the neurosurgeons are going to open their brain and tried to identify the spot in their brain that is the main onset location for their problems. So think of a epilepsy for example. Epilepsy typically is an anomaly in your brain where one cell in your brain so to speak, starts firing with no reason, no provocation, kind of like an earthquake in your brain and it speaks and other cells answer and other cells answers those who answered them.

Speaker 1:          00:18:29       Before long there was a cacophony of a cell speaking in your brain. And when those cells picking your brain, they actually lead to a change in your behavior. So when sales speak without any provocation, maybe you start shaking or losing consciousness and falling up down. And the risk of course is that you may be, we'll have a car accident, you could drag your cow or maybe you drop your baby if you're holding your baby. So the risk beyond just the epilepsy there is clear life. Most patients with epilepsy get treated with medications that suppress the seizures, but if they call it responsible communications or something doesn't work, they become candidates for this procedure. What we're going to bring into the lab, open their brain stick electrodes in the area in their brain where we think or suspect of the seizures onset. We'll plug those wires to a computer and it's not like holding their brain activity 24 seven for the next couple of days while they sit there and wait to have a feature.

Speaker 1:          00:19:18       Now we wanted to have a seizure because when they have a seizure, we can actually trace this seizures flow in their brain as it goes and figure out exactly where it started. And once we have enough features to it that they find a location that can actually take out the electrodes and the SEC, the part of the brain, it stopped the seizures, close everything, and send the patient away seizure free. So that's the clinical purpose of this procedure. And what I do is I say to the patient, you know, you're already here. Yeah, but I thought in your brain and when holding your acuity all the time while you watch TV, read books, talk to your friends, do you mind or thought, I think we showed you pictures of Colgate and crest and see how you make decisions and understand how thinking works in your brain.

Speaker 1:          00:19:55       Now the patients are very happy to participate because they really can't move their head much, and this is most of what they're doing, their hospital talking to us. So now there's a chance for us to actually look at the brain over human from the inside and eavesdrop of activity of cells in the brain and see how thinking look from inside. So here's an example of how it looks. So here's one patient. What you see here are the images that they see on a screen in front of their eyes and what are going to play. Two is the sound of one sale in their brain that codes something and tried to see if we can figure out yourself what this cell codes, what is the thought the decel responds to. So this is the cell

Speaker 2:          00:20:48       in this woman's brain code, the thought of Melody Manoa every time she thinks about him on the wall, this cell fires and infecting your brains right now, if you know what men and Moodle is or who she is or have any concept of her, I mean if you think about that sends in your brain, come to life. And they did the same thing right now. This is how I thought looks inside the brain. Nope. What's interesting is that this is not just a thought that's specific to this image. It's every representation of the Iud or Manuel and we know that because it can do many things. We can actually show her not just one picture studios. We can actually show her friends on some movies and you'll see that when she sees a movie you would it it the law, the same set of fires in a different pattern but the same idea. So you heard him say that again, movies

Speaker 1:          00:21:51       and you have Kevin to sustain as long as I taught in this person's mind and what's even on the boulevard mall. It's like it doesn't have to come from the outside. If you close your eyes and you mentioned on the Lord the same thoughts we don't carry in your brain and the same cells with fire and we know that because we tried it, we don't have patients. One of my callings actually had the patient sitter, I just like call from her memory. The clips she has seen in the morning once you're going to see now is that when the patient remembers my name on the wall, the same cell fires, and in fact it's fires seconds before she speaks. So we see her thoughts coming to her.

Speaker 1:          00:22:32       This means that we can now look inside the patient's brain and see how her thoughts in marriage. And what's interesting here isn't just that we can decode it thoughts, but also men can code them earlier than she expresses them and even earlier than she thinks she taught them. So if you asked the woman, why did you think about it? My all, she wouldn't say when I said that though a fraction of a second before she wouldn't imagine it in her brain. There are cells that come to life that code the thoughts second before she speaks. In fact, when I talk to you right now, I don't really feel it. Anything I'm saying is being planned in my mind before I feel it, whatever I think it, I say it then the idea is that you and I are both witnesses of my brain happening, adjusted.

Speaker 1:          00:23:11       I own it. And I think that, I wanted to say because it's out of my mouth, we both experience whatever my mind is saying in real time, but one of us thinks that it must be something that I really, really feel comfortable with because it came out of my mouth and we don't experience those bosses that's come up with the verb and the structure and the vowels and put them together and the adjective and brilliant and build the idea. We just see the bottom line and we call this my thoughts. Nope. Once we find Dalton your brain, then we can actually code them. There's always we can do with it beyond just eh, Eh, predict what you're going to say. We also do all kinds of tickets are now really in the public eye a lot, which is a connect your brain essentially can machines and have you come knock on the outside wall.

Speaker 1:          00:23:54       So we can do things like have the patient sit there in bed and a play games with her mind. So she just sits there and thinks I've met them on the wall and when she does the space you've goes up. And we can have her play a game. We should try to avoid obstacles just by thinking about them a lot. And it can kind of punishing her or giving her a reward for doing that. Eh, we can do that, of course, to show that we can. But the idea behind that is that we can now take people who lost the ability to control some parts of their bodies because the connection was separate. Think of soldiers who were hit say from the neck down and now have no connection from the mind to the arms. And we can now read their thoughts and control a prosthetic arm that will actually activate their wheelchair or turn the channels on the TV or write emails for them or do everything that they can do with the motor activity themselves just by thinking their thoughts in their mind.

Speaker 1:          00:24:39       And you can also do the most interesting thing that I could think of in terms of gross hindsight now, which is decode a personal start in real time. So our main work a few years ago was one where we basically had patient sick in bed, think on one of multiple things that we found earlier in the morning in their brain. Very Manilow, my contacts on their mom, their dad, the Eiffel Tower, anything we could find in the morning in their brain. And we can just decode their projector thoughts on a screen in front of their eyes. Now what's mine? What's we need to think about that is first that we can do it, but also that once they get to that we can actually find how early can we tell what you're going to think. And also at what point is your brain taking those thoughts and making them into a conscious person. At what point does your brain calling all of that reality?

Speaker 1:          00:25:27       And the interesting thing is that it's not obviously happening in realtime. In fact, it doesn't happen necessarily at all. So here's an example. Here's a picture that you are seeing. It's kind of flickering. And I can tell you that your brain is all of the upset of this picture and it tends it. Something's not right here. It just that you don't listen. You're consciousness isn't that we have it. So Eh, what you see here is actually not just one but two pictures. They alternate and there's one aspect of the picture that keeps changing and coming back. And I can tell you that your brain's all seat in your brain. There's a salad right now, fires and stops and fire that stops. It just doesn't tell your consciousness. Try to see if we can raise your hand if you can say it. Don't say or just raise your hand. So those of you who don't say it right now, get nervous. You're starting to scan the picture from a top to bottom, left to right. Maybe the Canada flag. Maybe it's the shadow of the soldiers. You count the soldiers, you look at the number of windows on the airplane. It's the engineering center pointed out.

Speaker 1:          00:26:27       The good thing is that if you've, once you've seen it right now, you can never not see it. This is it. It's one time learning. So for the rest of your life, it's going to be in your brain right now. And what's interesting beyond the fact that it's a cool experiment is the idea that in your brain there is some cells that code engines and cells were firing and stopping and fire something all the time. It's just, it's somewhere. It didn't bubble up into your consciousness and you, even though you wanted it, couldn't get the part of your brain, the toilets to give it to you. So somewhere in your brain there was a gap between who knows the answer and who is actually in control. I'm sorry, not an example. So if you felt smarter than the first one, you have a chance to try another one. Raise your hand when you say that.

Speaker 2:          00:27:07       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:27:07       It's funny as hell though. It seems to people it actually correlates with Iq. If he didn't see both, eh, no, he doesn't know what's going to Iq. Okay. It's the leaves right here. How do you hold her so we can go on and on with them? Any of it. I was at temple, but the point is somewhere in your brain, someone knows something and it doesn't tell you no. If I know that this person, you'll bring saw something and I can find in a gap, it's big enough. I can actually not just fight it out but also change things. And what are we going, we've got this one step further, which is to see what happens if I change something before the time you become aware of it and actually make you have a different sense of reality. So one of the things, but these are patients will, we had them play a game or we said we're gonna have you make simple choices.

Speaker 1:          00:27:54       Again, the very basic we're giving them, I wouldn't inbox me two big red buttons, one on the left, one on the right. And we told them this next comment about the making decisions for the next 20 minutes. We asked you to just sit here and whenever you feel like it's pressed, the buttons on the left, on the right in random order. So left, right, right, left, left, right, left and so on. Nothing important. Just make choices and we're going to want to know how your brain looks on your decisions to go left or right. That's it. But as always, there's a twist here. Does the patient, by the way, because we care about choices, everything in press a button we're going to turn the lights on for a second just to see the data from your brain. This is what we know that we're saving.

Speaker 1:          00:28:32       So when we're saving, please don't touch anything. Wait for I to turn off. And then you can start on a toilet. So important when the rights are own, don't touch anything like depression and start the game. And for the first maybe 50 trials, the patient just pressing the buttons and we just leave it there. Bring the community normally. But after 50 trials also when we fill it, we can actually decode their thoughts far before he or she will execute. Think Damon, we actually starts the real experiment. Well, if as times zero, I know anything, four seconds are going to press the buttons, I wait maybe like nine and turned them on on their own. So when you press the buttons did I told her the on and there's a big puzzle in order to tell you what did you do? You're just wanting to experiment. We don't even have to do one thing.

Speaker 1:          00:29:10       Don't touch [inaudible]. I'm so sorry doctor. What kind of happened by itself? Never mind you just throwing everything that we're gonna start again and make sure you don't do it again. What you see is this a unique experience or the patient's experience, what they want to happen. It's already happened and they can try to move faster. They can try to kind of take us to go to the right and they move to the next, but it doesn't matter. I mean inside our head, as soon as they know I already know. So here's kind of how it looks.

Speaker 2:          00:29:36       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:29:56       Remarkable is this kind of experience that we all can think about but don't really believe. But when I tell you your thoughts are known to me before you, you kind of said that's cool, but I don't really experience life. Like this week we called it the illusion of free will. We can talk about freewheeling, let's look at here. But we actually believe that we're in control and these patients for the first time have this unique experience that they really feel this experience of not having control. You go to the restaurant, you say there was dragging the menu steak, Solomon in Salad and you, sorry, one thickness up and say, oh sorry, we're out of felon. Oh I was about to say started. Nevermind. I was talking like, oh there's no phenomenon. So we basically eliminated things from your life before you made them and this gives you this experience of lack of control in a very unique way.

Speaker 1:          00:30:38       Which no, we tried to extend the psychology. What's interesting here actually isn't debt. What's interesting is what happens next. So the fact that I can actually change things into all that before you experienced them because I know them early is cool, but that's surprising. Once I find a stones, I can do whatever I want. What actually is interesting is if we can do something even more complex. So I know at times zeal that in four seconds are going to press the button. I can wait 3.9 seconds, but I can also turn the lights on as soon as I know it. And if I turn the lights on when I know it, it's so early that you don't even know that you were about to know something. And in fact, what happened, his mission sit there and see lights turning on off on off, and they have no understanding of why those lights turn on and off.

Speaker 1:          00:31:18       He doesn't know that it's their brain who wanted it because the light's shining on it actually stops your brain from experiencing it. But there are brain knows it because it said the signal. So what happens is that there was actually our conversation here between me and their brain behind her back and we know that it's still, because at some point the cells in their brain stops functioning because they kind of see that they said action to be happening and it didn't happen multiple times and he just thinks something doesn't work and this will tend to go back afterwards. So there's a unique opportunity here to speak to someone as being behind her back and really get a sense of the person and their unconscious mind. And the reason it's interesting is because when the of life through the part of their brain that to the contrast spots, then we call this me, we think this is us, and now for the first time we can actually give those patients access to bottom turn, bring that they normally have no control over.

Speaker 1:          00:32:04       Most of our brain is actually not under our control. When you see the world, it's already in the coral. Some bottom, your brain had to add Niccolo decode shapes and orientations and when you seek it's all can call in. If I tell you, please make the wall black and white, you can't do that. Even though your brain has the capacity to change Colo, you can't really turn it off because it's happening under the hood in Pleasanton, they have no access to different things that are more accessible to us. Oh, file from our controller emotions. Emotions are something you can actually kind of control. You have some access to them, but they don't really fully under your control. You can, you don't. So you know, my mom is sick. I want to feel sad, I'm going to activate [inaudible] now. Okay. The acclimates sadness, it's kind of, it's not working like this.

Speaker 1:          00:32:45       They don't know us. We can control the inputs, but at the same time the emotions happen and we kind of witnesses to them. Now with these patients for the first time he used to be, you can actually put electrodes in those places where Carlos had Brandon, we're emotions happen, we're breathing happen and teach them how to control their brain in a different experience. So we have now works where we teach patients how to control their emotions. We put the records in their emotional part of the brain. We tell them using feedback. That's something that they did right now actually send a feedback to the emotion dilemma. Now learn how to control your fear. So you want to feel afraid or actually feel afraid and just change the levels. We can actually control them, let them control their breathing. So up to now we define a person is alive or dead by looking at part of the brain that control their breathing.

Speaker 1:          00:33:28       And if it's not active, we call this person did with our patients and one of our works, we can actually teach them how to move the control of their breathing to a different parts of their brain. So they seem like they're dead in many ways, but actually you're just controlling their relief on different spots. And the idea is that now we unlock a lot more of our brain. One of our brain is active but only a swap offender. It is under our control and now we don't, the records that we put in different places plus fitbit from those places, we can actually teach people how to control them. Okay. So I want to a use also the last five minutes to talk about something inspiring. And for that I have to connect our work to what we're doing right now and where I think it's heading first.

Speaker 1:          00:34:06       A little bit of history. So October 28 2010 is when the work I mentioned to you right now came to life as they can be published it. It was published in a very high profile journal Academic Journal. And because of that, a lot of people in the world cared about our work. And journalists called me and asked me a question about it. Then one of them was a journalist for BBC England who said, we're really curious about how you can a project people's thoughts on the screen, Eh, tell me about that. And nice explain their work a little bit. And then he says, Eh, what else can you do with it? Like if you can protect someone starts, can you project her emotions and a screen or maybe their memories or their dreams. And I say, Eh, in theory it's possible. Thank you. Bye. So the other thing that happened was that I told someone from RBC that it didn't make coding.

Speaker 1:          00:34:45       It's possible in theory. However, the theory was lost quickly in the headline and before long the title was doing, my calling is possible. And they were still kind of a quotation mark making. It's seemingly a maybe possible, but this didn't stay with quotations mark very long, about five minutes into the word, the moment our work came out, the entire world was up in arms about the fact of scientists that according your dreams in quickly, Eh, not just the coding your dreams, but there were questions about how we do that. In how long have we been doing that? Eh, Eh, people father calling me and saying they want to subpoena me because I've been involved with the approach by the CIA to recall their dreams for the last couple of years. Eh, people call me and ask me if I can look at their spouses dreams. A lot of that, eh, there were, there was actually a chef not far from here who is a famous chef in New York who said that he's been dreaming of a recipe for years now and he wants me to put the records in his brain and extract them.

Speaker 1:          00:35:42       Eh, big Eh, operating system company called us and wanted to option the billing coding machine, Eh, in the next hour west. And when I told them they don't exist, they said, I'm playing how to get in there. You're going to build her own. Eh, there were a websites and Wikipedia pages for the democratic machine and the word was excited about this thing. This was in fact for a few days. The number one, Eh, you know, story on science and tech, let coding and despite me saying everyone, it's impossible story and a life of its own. I was pretty fascinated, as you can imagine from this thing. I called my dad who is a journalist and I said, dad, how do you kill a stoic and said son, no one cares about science. Just turn off the phone and wait. It's going to die on its own. It didn't, it didn't happen where the story, because I didn't take a course, eh, just came via email and a lot more attention was given to it.

Speaker 1:          00:36:29       Attract, might not answering, just made it worse. The worst thing I did was because it was it. It came out in 20 October, 28 three days after it was Halloween. My students had the idea that we're going to go to a Halloween party and I had the idea to make a joke of this and dress up like a zig won't void. So this, you know, this is days of a really massive sharing. The picture came out and now there was not just like a headline but also a picture of me looking at, it goes on and, and, and this was the kind of a in my life for about two weeks as a career killing experience. But what was interesting is that I spent a lot of time talking to the news and explain to everyone that the recording is impossible and that we didn't do it.

Speaker 1:          00:37:10       And it's not really a how our work could be done because we only looked at patients when they were awake and nothing could work when they're sleeping. And this story actually died when Prince William proposed to his girlfriend. And this was the commercial important thing. And it was out of my life for a number of years until one day in April of 2013 I got a call from BBC again and they asked me to a comment again on when we called him, I said, Eh, you've been to it before. You know it's not true. And like this is the time to actually correct the mistake. And they said, wait, wait, stop. We know that you didn't do that, but we actually want to commit to the work of you can come a tiny from Japan or did it. So it turns out that a group in Japan didn't know that it's impossible.

Speaker 1:          00:37:51       And they just saw that someone did it and they just follow up on our work. They actually eh one or to improve on the same technique that we didn't use. And they were the first guys to do what we said was impossible. They were the first guy I spoke to, the core, the dreams, they in a technique that was developed in Berkeley by a guy called Jack Golan to basically the idea is that you put electrodes, Eh, next part of her brain that decode visual activities. So not really the thoughts like we do, not the wall, but just lines and shapes. And they essentially, when people were awake, looked at their brain activity and in the back and we are that they could actually be code on the left is a movie that people were watching. And on the right is what the computer suggests, Eh, the person who will sing.

Speaker 1:          00:38:31       And this was done using Fmla, which is a much more crude tool than the one we use. Instead of looking at all, you would see a person or you would see a woman. That's about it. But the idea is that the hoop in Japan could actually have people go to a scanner and sit, lie down, lie down there while their brain is being scanned. And fortunately from my experience, a undergrads tend to fall asleep in every study that you could them. So it was very hard to get them to fall asleep in the lab. And when they fall asleep, a computer basically looks at their brain activity and trying to decode eh, one of a small number above categories. Is it text? Is it an object? Is the person. And we turn out to be pretty good in being able to then wake up the tension and as the person telling me what you think you dragged over and get a sense of the narrative if you want, or at least our kind of gist of what they're doing.

Speaker 1:          00:39:19       And this unlocks one of the coolest, I think, think in a human experiments. And the idea of looking inside creams. Now Dreams, they're fascinated by humans for the last, you know, mean for Millennia. And not only are the fascinating, but they also are in our mind, the kind of access to our soul. You know, if you wake up and you tell your girlfriend that you had a dream about your ex girlfriend, she's gonna be upset with your awake self. And you can say, no, it was my brain created this movie. I'm not responsible. Somehow we get, we get blamed for our brains in movies and in that sense, whether it's true or not, we all think of dreams mean a lot. Eh? There is entire set of professions that tried to interpret dreams. The psychiatrist who spend a psychologist spend days on couches with the people trying to have them tell their stories and a lot of it is there.

Speaker 1:          00:40:07       It means something or not. We don't know the full understanding, but for the first time and just the way we can actually code debt and that's the American one because up to now we are to rely on your awake self. The tell us the story of your living stuff and we know that [inaudible] not aligned. We know that the language you use to tell your dreams, for instance, the language of your wake self. If you're blind, when you're awake, you surely we tell your story as if your dreams were not with visuals. Eh, in the 1930s people would discard our drinks in black and white. Only when TV and film started have Carlos did people start discovering their dreams in Cordele because somehow in their mind a dream is a movie. And so whatever it was, movies in their mind that is how they discovered their dreams, which means that whatever we have is awake people is the language we use to charge dreams.

Speaker 1:          00:40:51       And this is unreliable and for many, many decades we couldn't really know what's going on in your dreams because we only had their wake self. And now for the first time in history, you can actually look at your dreams and a actually the code, the content and compare first what your brain tells me happened in your side and what you say, but also get access to something that you might've forgotten when you woke up. And this isn't just a cool thing that allows us to actually project dreams and tell you the story that you had in mind and see how they aligned to what it is. It also allows us to change behavior because Eh, what we learned in the last three years is that when you're sleeping, your brain isn't just resting. It's actually overworking if you want one thing, a lot of things, and one of those things is actually choosing behaviors to get once to save and what I would want to eliminate so that when you wake up you have a different story to craft and if you go back to the beginning when I told you that or our consciousness does is taking memories and building them into a narrative.

Speaker 1:          00:41:50       Now we know when it happens. We know that at some point during the night there's a window of time that happens every 90 minutes where your brain essentially looks at all of the memories it has from the day and choose which ones to encapsulate, which ones to eliminate. And if we got to the point of this moment in change something, we can actually create a new memory so that when you wake up, you're going to build into a narrative and change your behavior, not just a POA. In one of their studies at my colleague did in a few ones, like a few years ago in 2015 she took smokers who come to the Lebanon and I'll ask to take a nap. That's all. They don't tell anything. They got to take a nap. And when they get to the specific window, when your brain essentially assesses what's important in life, she sprayed the smell of nicotine into their nose, making their brain focused right now on smoking as a thought and then immediately just spray the smell of organ eggs, which is a smell that's known to scientists to actually benefit your brain and make you have a variety of response without waking up.

Speaker 1:          00:42:46       So she pairs in this person's brain, the idea of nicotine and bad experiences multiple time in different kinds of patients. And when the person wakes up after two hours, not only do they not know what happened, they actually think that it was just a regular neck, but there are brain internalized the conditioning and for the week after they actually don't smoke or smoke very little functional. It goes back afterwards. So we didn't find the solution to check it entirely. But if find a way to start teaching your brain things that you will actually live by afterwards without knowing what happened. And of course I have to try right now to do it repeatedly and see if it's a stance data most strongly and see if it actually change the, we agree entirely, but now we know when your brain actually stores and creates memories. Then if we come in between and change things, you're going to do the work for us in making those into a narrative, a contrast for search of yourself, never spoken or never been in this room with us and then you will actually use that to tell a different story of herself.

Speaker 1:          00:43:42       Okay, so why am I telling you all of that and we just about to end because we kind of unlocked the meaning of the thoughts. We know the code of a thought and we know how to find them in your brain. We're now able to map them and we're able to project them into outside and actually use that to get access to what you're about to do before you do that. That's pretty cool. We can also look at that in specific moments in your life and change things that are under the hood. So you will only experience them after the fact and just defend them as if they were your thoughts and live a life that aligns with them. And we now can use it to even look at your brain and change your behavior in a massive way such that you will actually stop all kinds of behaviors that you don't like.

Speaker 1:          00:44:23       And now we're playing with the idea of actually coding dreams into your mind and actually going inside and making a story that for you so you can actually go to sleep and the infant Spielberg and you know, have a dream or actually seeing if we can align people's dreams. So take two people who sleep side by side and actually make sure that they actually have somehow related to them. So you go on a date and you can be calm and in the day doesn't end. You actually continued to drink together. Or the ultimate goal of this work is to try to see if I can actually teach you new things when you're dreaming. So you can go to sleep and wake up [inaudible] not working so far, but besides all of that lies the coolest thing in which I'm going to end with it. I started with that when I'm finished with that is the idea that we now actually change the center of the locus of control in our brain.

Speaker 1:          00:45:08       So we live life like the character from the King Kong, Eh should con game earlier thinking that we're controlling the character and we give more and more evidence to people that were not. But it doesn't change anything. We still think that we're in control and it's because it's hard for us to change this. It's hard for us to accept the fact that my brain has component and make decisions and I am aware of those only after the fact and just explain them. But there's a good analogy here that I really liked it. It allows me to at least accept it partially. And I think that if you follow this, if you just accept this partial understanding that I'm suggesting right now, it will help you in the future. And then we can take your questions about how it can actually implement that. And this is analogy from 408 years ago when they logo lea pointed his telescope to the moons of Jupiter and tried to observe the orbit.

Speaker 1:          00:45:56       What he saw was that the planets were not orbiting, Eh, the moods want orbiting the way he thought they should go. And the only way to explain this was to change the entire making some sort of system and put the sun in the center and Earth as the third planet from center. Now this to him felt like a failure of society. What does it mean that we're not of the universe? What does it mean that we're not the most important thing in the world? But once he accepted it, he was able to see far outside of what we thought the world was before he could see fall outside into the wide reaches of the universe. And in the 400 years to follow, we were able to explore the big universe and see a lot more of what's out there now in the same way in the last 10 years, being as understand that we're not the center of our old universe, that in our own head there are many, many planets.

Speaker 1:          00:46:45       If you want many voices, then the one we speak with is not the most important one. It's just the one we call us because it's the one we have most control over. And if you begin to understand that there's other voices there and that we can actually give access to those voices using electrodes or using other methods, we can actually uncover more of what's in your brain and tell you what your dreams mean, what's your choices mean, how you are with them and so on. And in that sense. So we're not only going to uncover the mysteries of the brain are going to understand the most interesting thing in the universe, which is us. Thank you.

Speaker 2:          00:47:19       [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          00:47:27       So now we can talk about it if you don't have your net on business or on anything that Eh, I want, which is to convince you that there's a need for people with the understanding of a machine learning and coding in this field fill. I made it seem easy. It just like listening to the brain. I can do it too. But the reality is that most of the problems we have right now, uh, just time series that we need to decode. We know that something happening in the Isla molded the Brandon was coding it. Want to know what connects what. So there's a wolf or a lot of knowledge here. Questions. Yes.

Speaker 3:          00:47:58       Well there's, there's a ton. Um, I have two actually. One is may be simply to answer. It seems to me that there's a huge need for enhanced resolution with noninvasive mechanisms. Is there, can you tell us something about latest developments in that?

Speaker 1:          00:48:15       Sure. So there, there is a big movement right now on the tries to basically use these results and make things that go into your brain control them. You probably heard about Brian Johnson and Elan Musk trying to eh, eh, go there. Generally we want to poke into our brain control things. The problem is that the only way we know to retinal break right now is to dig a hole in it, in and get inside. And this is not something that you all can try at home. So the science of that is pretty easy. Look, we know the language of the brain, we know how to do it. The question is how do we get inside the leading technique right now that people look into is ingestible trying to create pills that you will swallow and they will travel inside your blood brain barrier and get to your brain and live there and do things for you permanently.

Speaker 1:          00:49:01       So we know what a great viruses that go into to take cells and live there. And we tried to find the same way with pills. It's raising all the ethical questions and so on. And it also, Eh, I'm going to make prediction. I'll tell you how I think is going to work out. One in Silicon Valley rich guy is going to just poke a hole inside his or her brain and stick a chip inside that will collect their thoughts straight to the worldwide web and this would allow them to have advantages. They would do high frequency trading inside our head faster. They would this solve math problems faster than their play chess. Better than you because they have accident, die world and everyone's going to think they're insane for doing that, but then they're going to think, oh, they have an advantage, actually do the same and within a few years it's going to become widespread.

Speaker 1:          00:49:47       Anyone's going to do it himself and then become mainstream. It's not entirely science fiction. It happened. It'd be four in the 50s or forties I think the idea of a putting a silicon inside your breasts seemed like outrageous idea. Who's going to put something inside of her breasts? I think that right now, what is 70 years later, one of four American girls, age 16 asks for a breast implants when she turned 16 birthday. So I think it's quick from the moment someone does it and it looks great. At the moment, we actually all accepted. So that's my prediction. Very few, very soon in people bring, it's like a question then we take.

Speaker 3:          00:50:19       So sorry, I'm just really, really want to ask this. Um, so it seems to me that a lot of the studies you've, uh, an experience you've described deal with decisions that are not very consequential or to destroy it differently that people do not have a conscious, uh, interest in modifying. So, and this and this kind of, you know, thinking about this makes me think about thinking fast and slow and you know, it doesn't seem like their executive function, the prefontal cortex were involved there, or at least that they tried to initiate them. So this description of you, a living as a bystander to decisions that are already made seems to be to be like a partial description of reality, the flex to certain things, but that you're probably able to regain control if you apply, uh, other parts of your brain to cause that's, that's correctly. What can you tell us about that

Speaker 1:          00:51:15       up to now? We forget. We've tried to train a simple things like and when we try even behavior, you can change your wife and you pick the one you liked it more when you pick your wife and we'd give you somewhere else you would notice right away. So it doesn't work. We did cross sectional choices on the behavioral about. However, the smoking experiment is indicative of the fact that they actually, we can change behaviors that were at least, Eh, something that you were doing. I mean, surely. So smoking experiment that we now have one where we tried to make people eat healthier, getting to go to sleep, they can nap. We essentially activate the flavor or farther in their brain when you wake up, we say, here's a buffet. She's like, you want? And they choose themselves, could eat healthy. This is starting to go in a realm that is a little bit more like real life, but it's still not, it's still simple choices. Like we, I don't think we can, uh, have you go to sleep by the public and make up a democrat or vice versa yet.

Speaker 4:          00:52:07       All right. Thanks for that talk. It was my loan. So I work in advertising and uh, you know, it's interesting that you brought up like some fruit because you know, advertising and public relations and Sigma for psychology, I have done this was for the past century and all the examples that you gave were really are inspiring and they were coming from individuals wanting to change their own behavior. Um, but if they feel that I'm in right now is really interested in cognitive behavioral theory, choice architecture, whereas not necessarily I want to be a better person. It's like I have a product and I want you to buy it and a, and this terrifies me because it just seems like one more tool in the toolbox. And as exciting as the says, I just have, this is still the ambition where you have the, you know, the rich students, silicon valley that has super powers and then 97% of people on earth that having choices, me for them, like the person that thinks we're choosing the biotin. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:53:13       okay. How do you see it for Beth? This can be used to make people stop smoking or eat healthy. But it can also make you wake up in one corner corner better than Pepsi and it works the same way to bring, doesn't know what thought that you, so it's, it's absolutely the screen. I mean if I were to choose my dream audience, this would be this tool because you are in many ways are the ones who are able to navigate the toy. So it would take forever until what we found right now, how we did it will turn into a regulation by the government and something that's so, so that it's going to be self regulation for now a company is we have to decide how to use that. And in the same way we understand that we can make people eat healthy. We can also make them do things that are not great for them. And what I would say if I talked to my son and I would say, I hope I could speak to people that FDA have the power to use it right now.

Speaker 1:          00:54:11       I mean it stoically no, my, I teach Mba students and when I teach them, there is still young and eh, kind of, I don't know, pure. And we talk about the cognitive biases and we talk about behavioral changes and they all are up in optimistic about too, how Procter and gamble prices tied the six 99 when it's actually seven. But it's fooling your sensors and then they go and work for proctor and gamble and the gloves, same choices. So, eh, because it's like, you know, shareholders and pressure and so on. I think that, Eh, science is only so good in offering options and then the world has to decide to do with them.

Speaker 4:          00:54:50       Do you have any tips for someone like me when somebody comes and says like this, this thing's going to be amazing. It's going to drive. So many conversions is going to be so effective other than it just feels wrong.

Speaker 1:          00:55:01       Um, I would think a better one than ever right now because I think it's the, but I mean you think young, but I think in 20 years are going to be to feel this company has thought, Eh, [inaudible] agree that when you're going to see all you remember at this moment, and Eh, I think I'm up in the meeting, I think that the world is actually getting better. So the fact that you asked this question means that it's like, by the way you've seen it, you see the problem, you see the potential. Is there opportunity institute threat, then I think that's a great first step. And the reality is that every time I gave this talk with different version, people raise these questions, which means that we all see that and we're both customers and companies. So if you do it to one person in the evening, they're going to do they after. So I think that I, historically, humans are not great in using science for good. We usually find ways to explain it, but I'm optimistic still. So I taught the questions. Great. Hello.

Speaker 4:          00:56:00       Thanks Sol. A sex allows for the insertion talks. I'm just wondering, so would you consider your, uh, your experiment as a counter example? Two of three. We'll, do you have any response from philosophers? Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:56:14       Okay. So I get asked a lot about free will and the reality is that, eh, we don't have a good answer in the sense that, so we get you beyond the moment you've experienced this for you. So if I ask you when you made a choice to go left or right, you would say no and what we showed you that this was a mistake, surely the moment you made the choice is not the moment that brand managers, we can go back milliseconds, seconds before the choice was made and predicted with high accuracy. But it doesn't mean that there's no free will. It just maybe happened before. Maybe flow will happen at time zero and just you experience it as fair. We'll have time for, so we don't have the answer to. It's like the Big Bang theory. We thought we can go all the way to the very beginning but we can't go beyond, Eh, I can tell you that we ask questions of our subjects in this experiment and we can say that their psychology, like the patients when they experience that there are choices to be belittled.

Speaker 1:          00:57:05       They do have all kinds of questioning about like more life. Like they become a little bit more protective of brides. The defend criminals, a little bit different than the, it kind of brings big questions about life. Eh? The counter answer is example that I read a few weeks ago there was a gene that Eh, if you carry this gene I think you are nine times more likely to be involved in a crime. Generally I think none of the people in this role chairing this gene and there's others care about this and if the y chromosome, so most bad things are caused by men so we can predict when you're born and you're going to be on the side of potentially bad big square. It doesn't allow us to do anything about it. We have to wait three to do those things. So when we came to judges with our results and said like, look, we can actually help you decode the intentions of people.

Speaker 1:          00:57:54       And they said, look, you guys, scientist came to us in the 1920s with eh phonology and he told us that you can touch the scallop and fee out when someone is going to something bad. And then you came up to us 10 years after and he said, no, no, this was a mistake. EEG is the right way to go. And then you can toss in the 70s with Fmr and now you're coming to us with your tools. We're going to wait a few decades before we going to let you actually predict behavior because you've turned your mind. I think their rights. I think that we can predict some extent, but we're still making mistakes and that's enough to not be a useful tool to really drive a cow. And just your thoughts. Thank you so much. Last one.

Speaker 5:          00:58:29       Yeah. So I'm actually a couple of other questions. The first one is a, in terms of I need to find people's thoughts and intentions, uh, that the state of the suicide is actually, is it mostly about trying to identify what areas of the brain get activated when people think somethings are, have some ideas? Uh, odd on the other side was looking at something like, oh, you have usually a few dollars, the 50 that you send to your speech centers, audio muscles or whatever. Uh, his other two main things that are there are, they are, they are as something much more advanced than there too.

Speaker 1:          00:59:04       So the mirror frames of our work has kind of two angles, one ticket, the one very theoretical. So the application is, we're trying to be really, really good in decoding thoughts so we can teach you how to control things outside and general behavior. So we want to help people get smoke to stop smoking. We went to the people who cannot move their arms, control a robotic arm or wheelchair and move around. This is the application. And then we just try to improve the, the accuracy. If right now I can predict your choice now 10 times, I want to get to 10 of them. That's that. The other angle is neuroscience. The fact that we found how the brain comes a taught in those electrical chemical is spikes is still crude. Eh? Sometimes you heard that it goes from but we don't know exactly like why is it that speed and that speed and presumably this Carrie is the most interesting part of our life.

Speaker 1:          00:59:55       Like those, it's not, the brain doesn't trend over the spike. Every spike mean something. So we now try to not just be binary and say Melman law, but we have in the law. But actually why is it coding amendment or this way? Not that way. What about associations? If my [inaudible] reminds you of a JFK will the cell that code minimum or Firefall Kennedy as well. If we fight for Canada, we would fight for Bobby Kennedy and other Kennedy's or just for one that you can. How far is it? So those are interesting questions. Philosophically, when in your life did you acquire this, why didn't you pick this cell, that cell? So the neuroscience is really both interesting and in need of people with technical skills.

Speaker 5:          01:00:31       Sure. Oh Man. The second question was, um, how transferable is this from one person to the other? But I'm assuming that the way one person has an idea, their knowledge base about myrtle is entirely different from, and there was some things about the idea of not a mentor. And uh, so, uh, do you see this being applied from a, you like, say something's 10 years, 20 years down the line and maybe 10 people maybe like, um, a thousand people see my billboard in Times Square and then somebody captures that data to figure out, just say what facing industry in terms of thoughts, uh, are, do you think this is not transferable at all based on the deal that you've seen?

Speaker 1:          01:01:09       So high level, it's not so highly about meaning in all of our brains that part of their brain that codes people is the same. So there's a part of it comes to life when you think about it or we're not going to go on a log, but within your spot there are many, many millions or billions of neurons and they're, they're chaotic. Like y'all made him a little failures here and mine is there. They're all in the same stadium, but you might sit in section one and section two and we didn't find any way to kind of map one brain to another in that highest resolution in, but there's a noble prize hanging on a, on, on the understanding of, you know, how the brain actually decide which sell to code this. There's all kinds of questions like how do I structure the fragment member weeds and moving them over night?

Speaker 1:          01:01:49       And there's a lot of people with what it is, but no one actually knows when the brain chose to put it here and not there. And why. Now, the reason it's really, really interesting is that I can map your brain and find the minimum on the oil and the Eiffel Tower and your mum and dead cells in your brain. And I can find anything he sprain. And once we do that we can actually override communication. So if you think about historically we're still, we know we evolved in a lot of ways in the last decades, but communication is still the same way. If you find any other time, like now he and you would speak the same, we'd vocal chords, eh mouth. And we know that it's a pretty slow process. I can think thoughts in about a 600 thoughts per second per minute soil, how much I can bring it in.

Speaker 1:          01:02:30       But I can talk them only at 150 words per minute. I can do 300 but you can do so. So we, we are, we're very slow like we think a lot faster than our bandwidth is to communicate them. And we also received the minutes festival. Clearly there was a card barrier here that if we overcome, if I can just find the middle and also in your brain and my brain and I think it, I just Zap your brain and you immediately see it, we can start using high frequency communication and that's pretty cool. Sure. Thank you guys. It was pleasure.

Speaker 2:          01:03:01       [inaudible].
