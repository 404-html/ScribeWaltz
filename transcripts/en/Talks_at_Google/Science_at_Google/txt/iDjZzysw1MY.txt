Speaker 1:          00:02          Thank you for coming to our most recent NASA Google talk. Today we have a Piramal PK as he's known casually, um, to talk about drones. Hormel is the manager of the safe operations autonomous systems unit at ames. He's been there for about 13 years and he holds degrees in both industrial and production engineering. Is that correct? Okay, great. Without further ado, I'd like to give it the stage over to PK.

Speaker 2:          00:31          Thank you.

Speaker 3:          00:32          Thank you.

Speaker 2:          00:36          Thank you for inviting me. This is a great privilege to be here. Uh, I had a wonderful Google lunch that everybody talks about, so that was nice. Um, today I'm going to talk to you about how we can enable safely enable large scale uas operations in the loyalty to their space. As you know, there is a lot of excitement going on in the drone industry and I know Google and many other companies are working on basically drones and drone applications. And our goal is to try to enable the entire industry in a safe manner. So let's, before we start to look at the future of aviation, let's look at the current evaluation system and how the aircraft operate in the national airspace system. What we referred to as Nass.

Speaker 3:          01:33          This animation displays air traffic over the United States. It was created using real air traffic data from the Federal Aviation Administration. The animation starts at 8:00 PM and ends at 8:00 PM eastern time the following day late in the evening. Uh, Russia flights can be seen departing for European destinations. Quite a few aircraft are still seen flying between the west coast airports. In the middle of the night the skies are clear and the number of aircraft drops below 900. Notice the red eye transcontinental flights headed to the east coast. Around 5:00 AM flights are seeing departing from Memphis, a hub for FedEx. As the day dawns traffic starts to build up on the east coast at 8:00 AM half of the country is bubbling with traffic while the other half is still sleeping, flights are seeing moving westward in the airspace gets populated with aircraft across the country. As the day progresses around 11:00 AM a steady stream of arrivals is seen coming across the Atlantic Ocean. The various airline hubs can be seen throughout the day. A hub can be identified by the density of aircraft around it. The two holes scene in the triangle between San Francisco, Los Angeles and Salt Lake City. Our military operation areas and civilian aircraft are forbidden to fly through them in the middle of the day. The number of aircraft peak just over 5,000 the animation shows the congested northeastern part of the United States and the complexity of the air traffic management problem.

Speaker 3:          03:16          This animation displays air traffic and weather over the northeastern part of the United States. In the beginning the flow is smooth but when severe weather strikes around 9:30 AM the airports can't handle the arrivals. Many aircraft are seen holding in the air shown by the race track patterns of blue lines which represent trails of aircraft arriving at four New York area airports. Several aircraft are seen deviating around severe weather and flying through gaps between storm systems. Many aircraft usually flying along the east coast. We're directed to fly over the Atlantic Ocean to reach their New York area destinations on this day of significant delays, weather impacted arrival traffic for more than seven hours, whether is the main cause of all delays of air traffic in the United States.

Speaker 4:          04:05          So let's talk about the two animation. The first animation actually shows the complexity in the national airspace system as it exists today. There are 50,000 operations in a day, about 5,000 at the peak time. Um, if you postulate the future with drones operating that, those numbers that you just saw, we'll compare really, really small with as compared with what we are expecting to happen in the future. So we really need some way to organize this traffic. The second animation that assured us that the complexity increases as soon as the weather actually happens to come in the national airspace system. So as soon as you experienced the weather, we have tremendous delays and lots of impact in the airspace system. Now if we start to look at the future for those who have gone to India and other places or have seen these pictures from the past can postulate and relate to this, that when you start to have number of new entrants on the road, all of a sudden you realize that you need some way to organize them because the complexity is gone up and you have different interests and different types of operations happening and the and without some kind of organization you are going to have a trade off between efficiency and safety.

Speaker 4:          05:23          So all of sudden you realize that let's, let's make sure that we have some way to organize this traffic. What happened in 1956 is two aircraft collided or Grand Canyon and that started the air transportation system and a traffic management system. 1958 when [inaudible] was born at the same time NASA was born. So what we are trying to do is get ahead of that and come up with a system that will allow us to enable safely enable large scale drone operations or the low altitude currently the loyalty to their space. Typically College Class G space is unregulated but not control. So as soon as you start to pump in lots of drones and other vehicles there, we would like to see that they basically operate harmoniously with each other, helicopters, personnel, calf cause as well as drones. How do we do that? So our near term goal is to basically safely enable these operation as soon as possible.

Speaker 4:          06:22          And the longterm goal is to accommodate the complexity and increased basically capacity that is expected to happen in that airspace. There are lots of applications of drones that have been postulated of course surveillance of key assets like railroad and pipelines, search and rescue, cargo delivery, Uav helping, ambulance taking pictures, recreational activities and such. So once you realize that there are a number of these operations going to happen at the same time, same place in the same airspace, uh, then we really say that, let's make sure that we have some way to organize them. So that's basically calling for a persistent system at an airspace and a geographical area as well as you look at the board table system where you go from one basically area to another area area such as a disaster relief applications or agriculture applications where they are very confined due to that geographical area or airspace.

Speaker 4:          07:21          So we are talking about two different types of applications. Nonetheless, the characteristics of enabling them safely and harmoniously or the same in terms of us traffic manager management. We are really trying to balance three goals. First goal is national and regional security. We want to make sure that the drones by the accidentally don't go where they shouldn't go. Uh, such as uh, uh, White House and Wall Street and, and number of key assets on the ground as well as we don't have rogue operators that basically go and create damage intentional. So we have to worry about the national and regional security. At the same time, we are trying to make sure that we get economic value of using the low altitude using the drone applications. And there are number of these applications, commercial applications. Uh, as you saw agriculture application as well as personal applications. My personal draw, my personal dream is that every home will have a drone and every home will serve as a error or drum sometime in the future.

Speaker 4:          08:25          So how do we enable that that needs to be enabled through safe airspace integration. So the idea is to create flexible digital virtual infrastructure. So flexibility where possible and structure where it's necessary is one month mantra. And second is you match the geographical needs applications with the performance that's required to operate in that airspace. So let's take each one of them. So flexibility where possible. So the idea is that you can go wherever you want to go till the point where the demand and capacity are off balance. Then you may need some structures such as corridors crossing restrictions or altitude for direction. So it's completely based on the demand and the capacity. The second month, right here is the need of the geography as well as application. So here the context is that if you are operating in the remote areas and your application is you're doing surveillance, you're never going to get down to the ground.

Speaker 4:          09:24          Then the required performance on the airspace operations on the vehicle as well as airspace is different than you're going to operate in the congested airspace as well as near urban airspace and going all the way to the down all the way to the ground to the last and first 50 feet. So the performance characteristics on the vehicle and the type of capability you need on the vehicle is different. So we want to match the geography, the risks involved with that as well as the application with the required performance to operate in that airspace. So what is UTM question always comes, what is UTM? Utm sort of is a research prototype and ideally what we are after is developing the airspace operations performance requirements through this research prototype, which will allow the operators to basically submit flight plans, tons of light plants at the same time, and execute their missions at the loyalty to operations.

Speaker 4:          10:22          He will also check to make sure that there are no constraints, they're not violating any constraints. And we'll talk about what those look like. At the same time, we envision that these basically system will consist of multiple airspace providers, just like Internet service, Reuters, Isp, you could have multiple layers with service providers that could interoperate harmoniously in the same airspace. So let's look at the functions of Utm. The first function is airspace operations in management. So what is the boundary of the low altitude? So currently we envision 500 feet and below. Obviously that's dependent on the type of operations you want to conduct, the types of missions as well as the density. So you might want to change that. But nonetheless, at the moment we are envisioning that 400 feet and below there is no reason to climb, to spend energy if you don't have to.

Speaker 4:          11:18          And again, going back to the point we made before that geographical needs and applications will have to be coupled together. So the rules for airspace will be based on the performance and the geography that's associated with that operation. So this picture shows geo fences. So there are two types of Geo Francis. One is a static geo fence such as basically White House or in this case it shows a stadium and a dynamic geo fence such as wildfire affected area which moves over time so that Geo fence changes over time. So you need to have constant update, updated information about the Geo fences, which who are the areas which are sort of no fly zones or the aerospace to avoid. The second function of Utm service would be the wind and weather integration. So the idea here is that the current vehicles that operate in that area, this airspace are largely helicopters and gliders.

Speaker 4:          12:17          They have different susceptibility to wins. Then the 55 pound vehicle that is going to operate here. So we really need a lot finer grid and more accurate forecast of the winds so that we can actually show and make that information available to all the users to say which airspace is safe to fly, which is not then congestion management. As soon as we allow these operations, we expect that demand and capacity could get off balance in certain locations. And once that happens, then we need to have ways to manage that. So obviously this is only needed type of basically feature that it will create corridors or altitude for direction and any crossing restrictions based on the demand and capacity imbalance.

Speaker 4:          13:07          The other feature of this UTM is separation management. Ideally you want all the separation and collision management to occur on the way called side til the point where we have vehicles that get smart and can do its own sense and avoid. There is no reason necessarily to stop these operations. We can initiate these operations with number of different construct. First construct it is space reservations so you can actually file a trajectory or flight plan and say, okay, this airspace is mine and you complete your use case, our mission and then that is space gets open. You can actually notify to the other operators that I am operating in this airspace. I uh, in the future obviously as the density goes up, that is highly inefficient. So we want to see some kind of vehicle to vehicle sense and avoid and separation management, collision avoidance technologies.

Speaker 4:          14:00          And that could happen through sensors. On board as well as connected systems through Internet and what we call as we to V and V to UTM systems, much like autonomous cars. One of the underpinnings of that is tracking in the very remote areas over water. You may not need any tracking because there is density is very low. You gotta let them fly wherever they want to fly and they closed the the trajectory once their operation is finished. But as you get closer to the congested airspace, highly constrained airspace, closer to the Geo fence areas, you want to have sophisticated tracking, the number of options, cell phone based tracking, eight years be tracking it, ESB based tracking as Satellite Cube and k you when tracking. So let's take one, uh, each option at a time. The cell phone based tracking, which is promising, but currently only roughly 55% of the land is code by cell phones.

Speaker 4:          14:57          So what do we do about the rest eight years? We automatic dependent surveillance base. Broadcast tracking is also postulated, which also shows promise, however it has its own limitations. Then the question is what is the best way most persistent tracking mechanisms? So some places you may need combination of three cell phone, satellite based as well as [inaudible] tracking to make sure that we know exactly where the vehicles are. So the idea there is to make sure that they do not cross geo fences where they shouldn't go. And uh, another feature of the UTM is contingency management. Obviously we, the cost of entry into her space is gone to zero with these drones, which is really exciting because you see lots of good applications. However, it also poses some challenges such as nine one, one, it's possible conceivable that situations like nine one one could be, uh, could happen with drones.

Speaker 4:          15:57          So how do we actually tackle that? So you really need to know that which are the cooperative targets and which are noncooperative targets. So you may need a surveillance system around high value assets. We are also interested in making sure that the large scale gps as well as cell phone outage happens. And if that happens, how do you actually manage that? So where you call onboard vehicles will have certain capabilities, simultaneous localization and mapping and then some kind of basically record path and contingencies that says if you lose everything then you had about your basically trajectory and land in a safe place.

Speaker 4:          16:38          This cartoon actually gives sort of an idea what are the different steps involved in submitting the flight plan. Then checking through the UTM type of services. Uh, and these are by the way, not monolithic services. So number of operators can have their own UTM type of services and they can connect with each other. Um, so operator, we'll submit the, the, the flight plan or trajectory. It can be a scheduled one or it can be on demand than it would system will check for authentication, make sure that the vehicle and the operator is authenticated, then it will check for all the constraints. It will check for static as well as dynamic constraints. We'll make sure that there are no contingencies is, uh, is going through the right air space and it's not crossing any geo fences and such. And then operate as the operation is completed. It will and the mission. And the airspace will get open.

Speaker 5:          17:36          Okay.

Speaker 4:          17:36          Then we have four technical capabilities. The way we envision going about doing this. So it's missing this, which is interesting. But uh, nonetheless we finished that capability so it's less important. We finished that demonstration. So we are, the way we go about doing this is follow, crawl, walk, run strategy. So the idea is each capability targets, uh, different types of application, geographical area and the, and the risk associated with that. So the first capability, which we demonstrated a in August this year, last year included a special reservation as the basic construct. So you have trajectory planner, you can file the trajectory, it will check for all the constraints and that airspace is yours till you close that trajectory. And it uses either airspace notification or aerospace, the reservation as the construct to notify the other operators where you are operating. But that was focused on within visual line of sight.

Speaker 4:          18:35          So the next capability and the first capability really targets the remote areas, very low density operations over water and such a precision agriculture or things like that that operate in a very remote areas will be supported by this capability. The second capability goes, allows us to go beyond visual line of sight and also offers tracking of these vehicles through either cell phone, eight ESB or satellite based Kau band, uh, and again supports low density operations, sparsely populated areas. And there will be some basic rules when there are a number of vehicles operating at the same time in the same space. Uh, this will enable the longer range applications because it is going beyond visual line of sight. The third capability adds a separation management component to that which allows vehicle to vehicle or, or very cold through UTM connected systems, either through internet or some other means, uh, which allows to have some basic interaction with a manned air vehicles as well as unmanned systems.

Speaker 4:          19:41          So as I mentioned before, this is the narrative space where you see some helicopter operations. So, so it's very critical that we have a system that allows operators to keep away from each other. Fundamentally, we are after five basic principles. The first principle is drones don't hit each other. Second principle is drones and manned aviation stay away from each other. Third one is drone operator has complete awareness of all the constraints and avoids all the constraints in the airspace. Fourth principle is drone all the drone operator as well as the drones themselves or authenticated. And the fifth principle is drone operators and drones basically give preference to a public safety drones and public safety manned aviation aviation. So though using those principles, then we go to the basically the subsequent capabilities and the last capability, which is the fourth capability that allows you to operate in the urban high density is a space where you really need to worry about large scale contingencies that we talked about before.

Speaker 4:          20:50          But this is where our vision is. This is where everybody wants to go to be able to go to the fourth capability and allow lots of uses of drones in the urban airspace. Now the elegance of this approach is that it is not monolithic system that you had to actually apply the entire system everywhere. This is the way we have organized this research prototype is in a, uh, using cloud based services. So multiple providers who would basically offer different services. You could have multiple operators will pro, uh, just like I mentioned before, Internet service providers, you could have airspace service services providers and they could connect with each other through a common application protocol interface. So multiple providers could offer similar services. That could be some tailoring of operational services based on geographical area. This picture basically shows that if you are in a remote area or less congested airspace, you could get away with the build one or technical capability level one type of services.

Speaker 4:          21:56          And if you are in a very congested urban airspace, you may need higher levels of technical capabilities and requirements on the way you call as well as aerospace operations. So that shows you four, which is ut on four class of kind of airspace. So the elegance again is to try to make sure that you balance the services that are needed based on the airspace where you want to operate. The risks on the ground as well as the use case that you are after. And vehicle performance and vehicle characteristics needed across these four technical capabilities is different.

Speaker 4:          22:35          Now the question comes who operates this airspace and what's the right business model. Now different countries, we have been in discussion with many countries about how they think this will evolve in each location and different countries have different ways of organizing the businesses around this UTM construct. So it could be a single service provider, like a government entity. Traditional is, is based navigation services that could provide the service or it could be multiple service providers at the local state or county levels, uh, that could operate this. Or it could be a single service provider, but the non government entity, or it could be multiple service providers basically providing services to non government entities so you can customize and figure out how we can interoperate with each other. So that's sort of the basic idea of there's different business models and as I mentioned, the different countries are actually looking at different types of business models and fee for service kind of characterization. Regardless the regulator will have a key role in certifying the system and operations and all cysts, all UTM systems are there variations who will interact with each other.

Speaker 4:          23:58          So what are the key technologies then, you know, the question always comes what's missing? What are the barriers? What are the key technologies we still need to have? Now these are 55 pound and below type of vehicles. So their ability to carry size, weight, power is somewhat limited. So we really need to make sure that uh, that, that anything that you put on the vehicle can sustain in terms of size, weight, power and the cost. So first, uh, capability, new technology, key technology is a track and locate and there could be a combination of the things that we discussed. Cell phone eight years be satellite based technologies, a very small basically that can fit on on the smaller way equal and Kerry and a payload is small. The power is a requirement is small, but persistently in track we'll be able to track the way he calls and their location since an award.

Speaker 4:          24:53          This is an interesting problem. So, uh, as you see sense and avoid technologies evolving everywhere, the ability to carry the sensor packs on these vehicles is highly limited, which actually offers a lot of innovative approaches, a lidar based and vision based systems that actually have been tried. And one of the key challenges is too small objects such as these wires. To be able to see these wires from farther distance and to be able to basically stay away from them is one of the key challenges in the sense and avoid technologies because these vehicles are operating at the lower altitude. Last and first 50 feet operation autonomous operations is another interesting challenge. So what happens is you ideally you want these vehicles to operate completely autonomously all the way to the doorstep. Then the question comes, how are you going to tackle the problem where grandma is doing landscaping, kids are running around with soccer ball and um, there are pets running around.

Speaker 4:          25:54          So you need highly intelligent system. On the vehicle itself that census any obstacles along the way and basically figure so what to do with it. There are number of other approaches which are not necessarily technical. You could have a thread that drops the basically what our package you are doing a we're delivering is one way you could have a chimney that's raised, you could how your mailbox raised 10 feet. But nonetheless in the future we would like to see the last and first 50 feet operation happening fully autonomously. Whether sensing and production is another interesting area where you need a lot more refined where the sensing and prediction, particularly the wind in this airspace so that the way you call itself can actually take it or take advantage of the information and figure out what's the right path, what's the right optimal path for that particular use case and award the areas that they should avoid. And as I mentioned before, we see this as a, one of the potential here is that multiple service providers could actually offer services for the operator. So then the idea is to integrate them through some common application protocol interface.

Speaker 4:          27:13          In terms of progress, what we are done so far is that we are completed technical capability level one we did demonstration with 12 partners and the, we are successfully shown that the basic construct of airspace notification on the reservation, it could be adequate for remote kind of areas, uh, through the research. Our next step is to basically continue to evolve this prototype. So we have been working with very closely with FFA, Department of Homeland Security, Department of Defense, Department of Interior. We have something we referred to as research transition team that collaborates across the government entities. We also have very tight coordination and collaboration across industry and academic circles. We are over 125 collaborators from industry as well as a career. Uh, we developed the initial concept to operations. We demonstrated that we got a lot of feedback from lots of stakeholders and we continue to evolve this. There has been many, many basically discussions and and uh, simulations as well as testing of these construct.

Speaker 4:          28:23          Uh, we also released our application protocol interface. So anybody who wants to collaborate with us gets a application protocol interface that allows them to connect their subsystems as well as the very cooperations. Uh, as I mentioned, technical capability level one test will successfully completed and we have a huge international interest. We just got uh, over six international entities that are really interested in following the construct of UTM across different countries and figuring out how they can benefit from using the construct UTM. Our next steps. Basically we'll continue to evolve this construct of Utm, particularly in going towards high density urban airspace. Uh, we want to conduct, develop a conductor and more research on the sensors that we really need small as small as we can get continuous simulations and test these bills along the way. We will also continue to work with industry and other academy and government groups to refine the concepts and our assistant architectures are different ways of organizing the data structures as well as inter interacting with multiple operators. We have a prototype, then we will continue to evolve with that till we, we are able to prove that safe, um, integration, uh, could occur everywhere. We also have a national, a initial campaign, uh, focused on creating the UTM kind of structures are the FAA test sites and allowing them to do for the validation of the data.

Speaker 4:          30:05          Uh, I would like to show you an animation of how this, this system could work.

Speaker 6:          33:01          Yeah.

Speaker 2:          33:03          Any questions?

Speaker 7:          33:04          How do you think are terrorist attack employing drones? Would the impact development of a UTM and [inaudible] in general?

Speaker 2:          33:12          Well, obviously, uh, any, any terrorist attack is a attack is bad. I need it does search us back. Uh, and, and causes a pause like nine one one. Um, but, but I think that is, uh, the, there are two, two answers to that. One is that we shouldn't stop progress. So, you know, Asian will continue to occur to a word that, and second is there are technologies already in, in being developed that will detect uncooperative targets and then figured out what to do with them. But that's in the law and order kind of situation. So the idea here in the UTM is to figure out, uh, the, a rogue operators or uncooperative objects that are basically trespassing into geo fence. And that's where UTM stops. And there are a number of technologies are insane service and loyalty do radars that you may have to have at certain locations, key assets on the ground. Um, but it could, it could set us back, uh, but at the same time, uh, this is the time to actually think through and figure out what systems we need to be a base we need to put in place to, to avoid or prevent or basically manage that kind of situation.

Speaker 7:          34:26          I'm kind of curious, I was just listening to a podcast on private plane and drone, um, private companies that are doing surveillance and a lot of the problems they were coming up against were um, just public opinion and people like, uh, in cities voting down, wanting to have that around them. So just curious what efforts you guys have going in that direction.

Speaker 2:          34:49          Yeah, so, uh, that's a good question and we collaborated on with many entities are a number of things. And so the one of the, of the, the basically our thrust is technical aerospace operation performance requirements. So developing that side of requirements is what we are after. Obviously we understand the, the barriers are lack of these technical requirements. Second is a privacy consideration. Security considerations as the previous question. Uh, public acceptance and policies. Uh, we at NASA or not, we are not working on that particular problem, but we are collaborating with number of other entities. I've heard it as well as non entities to figure out what is the right way to do that.

Speaker 8:          35:41          Uh, in your slide with the business models, you kind of had different quadrants of one, one service provider to rule them all and then a federated system. Um, in your discussions in particular, I'm interested in international discussions of are the people falling into that quadrant somewhere where they're comfortable?

Speaker 2:          35:58          Yeah, I think, uh, there are certain countries who are, uh, who have prioritize operations already, airspace management ATM. Uh, so they, they have a preference for different quarter than some other countries. So I think really what they are familiar with, what their safety record is, what their density of operations and complexities, we'll make them comfortable. So different actually quadrons appeal to different countries based on that. And then the amount of investment that's needed. So that's a great question, but, uh, it's, it's fortunately one size fits all is not what we are after. We are basically allowing the cloud based architecture to, to go in any direction, any quarter and that a country wants to go. The system is w should be flexible enough to offer any of these services.

Speaker 9:          36:53          Uh, we've seen a lot of innovation in UAV over the last few years. Where do you see hobbyists and startups falling not just as aviators but as one's developing control systems in vehicles?

Speaker 2:          37:04          You are, I think it's been great. No, I thank you. Uh, I think it has been great and mean because of the, the number of innovators that have entered into this traditional as well as non traditional aviation companies. We have seen very rapid development towards sense and avoid technologies tracking and locating things and as well as a assured autonomy for last and first 50 feet. We are in saw all the problems, but I think we are, because of the collaboration we have with number of entities and the interest that, uh, that exist and the funding that's gone into this is unprecedented. I think, you know, so I see this as a great sign for aviation. It, it's really exciting to be aviator again. You know,

Speaker 9:          37:54          do we expect to see carve outs in the air space for people to develop these new systems or will they have to Polish it, you know, indoors before it can be released into the water air space.

Speaker 2:          38:04          Do you, what was the first sentence, do you see what

Speaker 9:          38:06          a carve out in the air space for people who are developing new vehicles and new control systems for vehicles?

Speaker 2:          38:12          Oh yeah. I think there's a lot already. There are a number of companies that are developing new systems for, some of them are developing operating system for autonomous systems on their control, new control systems. So I see a lot of opportunity.

Speaker 5:          38:27          Yeah.

Speaker 2:          38:29          And if you have ideas we obviously would like to work with you.

Speaker 5:          38:32          Okay.

Speaker 9:          38:33          So coming at it from a position of being

Speaker 10:         38:36          a private pilot, I'm curious your take on how much of getting this right depends on placing restrictions that don't exist today on aircraft. On current aircraft, like the, there's no reason for instance, that other than not having a commercial license that I can't go fly a crop duster out a couple hundred feet off the ground at very high speeds. Uh, and then you clear a UAV to fly through my field, uh, because all of that is unregulated right now. Uh, and the same for helicopters and sightseeing flights and other things. So it was given that we don't file these detailed flight plans and get reserved airspace, uh, for all of those sorts of operations. How do we fit uas into all of that?

Speaker 2:          39:13          No, that's a good question. Right. So, uh, and there are probably different answers depending on location and their density. Currently the space is regulated but not control the clause years is where general aviation largely occurs. And Yeah, they are not required to file a flight plan or trajectories, but some of them do. So one option is that you have, uh, basically, uh, the drone operators while trajectories and through network system, everybody has access to that information. So even before you take off as a general elevator, you have, you know, information as to where the drones are likely to operate. You know, uh, other one is basically very tactical, where both have some kind of way to coordinate with each other. We two weeks systems that are evolving now and keep away from each other. Right? So it's really a function of density and what kind of, uh, our risks we want to mitigate. If there's a huge amount of drone operations going on, same airspace, obviously you would like to know that and vice versa. So,

Speaker 10:         40:22          um, to the, to the same effective, if that would basically mean that in order to avoid hitting drones, you would either by regulation or by, uh, uh, preservation of life need to get additional equipment for your aircraft.

Speaker 2:          40:38          All right, so the, I think technology first as my bias, I, we try to figure out if we can solve this problem through technology. You know, obviously there is always the regulatory aspect. Uh, and, and that's something that FIS has to, I mean, you know, think deep, but, uh, if we can come up with this is where the innovation, the prior question, where is the innovation? This is where one of the possibilities where we could actually collaboratively in a way it's something that will actually help the entire aviation industry.

Speaker 11:         41:10          So the schedule for rolling out, you had a slide, the first one was empty and then you had three more. Uh, it's a fairly aggressive schedule. Um, and you mentioned some technologies that we're going to be potentially use like slam, which is a very, um, early, um, very challenging of David technology to use. So how do you feel that the pace of technology and I'm like processing power and battery and all those things is going to

Speaker 2:          41:34          look in the next five years compared to the types of regulation that we'd like to be able to enforce? Yeah. So the schedule that you saw, um, I should clarify that that's not a rollout schedule for operations. That's where we would like to do the test to understand that require marriage to operate in the rollout schedule. Obviously just not up to NASA. It's really about making sure that we have all the other issues, you know, as a previous boss and ask about privacy in public policy and then making sure that the FAA has the regulatory structure in place. So the rollout schedule will depend on a lot of other factors then what he showed. But the slam, I'm going back to your question about the slam technology. I think, uh, we are hoping that in four years we are working on some, uh, aggressively as well as you guys and many others on science and award and slam technology. So we are hoping that by 2019 we will have a reasonable prototype technology. So that's sort of our goal is to try to push ourselves to get to that point. Um, is it a risk in that? Yeah, it's possible that we may not get completely a hundred percent accurate by then, but I think the goal current indicators are that we are migrating towards that. So anyhow, have thoughts on particular risks in the technologies or things that we should be looking at? Obviously we are open to that.

Speaker 9:          43:03          Uh, at the moment we were already seeing a proliferation of radio technologies with General Aviation, like you have your uit transmitters and the 10 90 band. Um, do we expect, um, UAVs and drones to have, um, multiple radio technologies to communicate or, you know, will we just rely on a central point to coordinate?

Speaker 2:          43:23          Yeah, that's a good question. So we are, uh, we are exploring a number of, uh, aviation grid as well as currently non aviation approved technologies like cell phone based technologies. So, um, you, what you mentioned about be on the UAT and UAT technologies of frequencies are possible there one candidates, but then they could be cell phone based possibilities. So we are exploring that as well. Uh, we don't, we don't know exactly how this will a wall, whether it will consist of multiple, multiple technologies for the same platform based on the altitude or location or all of them may evolve differently. Thank you so much.
