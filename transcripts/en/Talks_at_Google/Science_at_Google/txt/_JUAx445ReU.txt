Speaker 1:          00:05          I'm pleased to introduce Dr. Jeffrey West. He's very likely, um, had the origin of our 20% time. It's a funny story. Um, we have there over lunch. I invite you to ask him about it sometime. He's a theoretical physicist. He's primary interest, have been in fundamental questions of physics, especially those concerning the elementary particles, their interactions and cosmological implications. Um, as long term fascination in general scaling phenomena involved into a highly productive collaboration on the origin of universal scaling laws that pervade biology from the molecular genomic scale up through my, the country on cells to whole organisms and ecosystems. And many of these ideas I think form the basis of his book that he's here to talk about today. Scale the search for simplicity and unity in the complexity of life from cells to cities, companies to ecosystems, milliseconds to millennia. Please join me in giving him a warm welcome today.

Speaker 2:          01:09          Thanks sir.

Speaker 3:          01:10          Whoops. White. So I'm going to give a, you know, a, um, uh, roads of this short presentation, short meaning I hope I can give it about 30 minutes. Uh, uh, giving an overview of what this book is about and it covers a huge territory. It's so, it's very impressionistic. It'll be a nontechnical. The book is not technical. The presentation will be not technical, but it deals with a lot of deeply technical and challenging problems. And, um, it's, uh, it's encapsulated in the title, which is here. But there was this cute thing that penguin press who produced the book produced. I can't help showing it to begin. Uh, this, uh, we just kind of fun.

Speaker 3:          01:58          There you go. So I'm a physicist. Um, as the set of new introduction, I said most of my career doing high energy physics quarks and gluons and string theory of dark matter and so on and so forth. And, um, uh, in a way what this book is about and what this talk is about is sort of taking, uh, that way of thinking and asking how far can you push it in terms of thinking about, um, a biology organism, mid life and a socioeconomic lines. And, uh, so a lot of what I'm going to talk about is going to be, uh, about, uh, cities and companies. And I'm also going to talk a bit a little bit about biology. Um, but, uh, the framework really is the whole, is, is trying to ask to what extent can you make a quantitative predictive mathematize them computable science of biological phenomena, biomedical phenomena.

Speaker 3:          02:59          And, uh, in some ways, more importantly for what I want to talk about socioeconomic phenomena. Um, and really the passion behind all this was the fundamental question as to whether this extraordinary enterprise that we've developed over the last, well, most 10,000 years, maybe you don't need really the last couple of hundred years is actually sustainable in principle. So that's what I'm going to try to lead up to. And, uh, as I said, I am, it's inspired by, uh, work that I've done in physics and in biology. So the first thing is that I've already knows that we live in a, uh, um, an exponentially, whoops, is this a India? Someone helped me if I press that. Oh, picture bridge. Actually, I talk about bridges in the book. I run the design of bridges.

Speaker 3:          03:59          Oh, very good. So we already knows we live in a, in a, uh, exponentially expanding universe. But what is often not appreciated is that of course we live in a exponentially expanding socioeconomic universe. And it's, you know, some figures that this that you're probably familiar with in one form or another, but, um, you know, 200 years ago when this country was founded, almost, there was a must entirely agricultural and rural, and it's now become overwhelmingly urbanized a, it's about 82% of the US population lives in cities. And just a couple of years ago, uh, the world cross this amazing point of being over half a of an eyes and it's moving towards that 70 to 80%, uh, mark in the next 50 years. So this is extraordinary, but it's sort of interesting to put it into sort of more a capturable terms. Whoops. And that is if you just average, so the next 30 to 40 years, that is equivalent to adding about almost one and a half million people a week to cities building that infrastructure.

Speaker 3:          05:07          That means building a New York metropolitan area every couple of months or a Seattle, the city of Seattle every few days. That's what's going. It's sort of extraordinary. So this is everything that we do is sort of with that backdrop, this phenomenon that is taking place. And um, you know, it's again represented by this. This is China. China was very slow to urbanize the, the yellow there is the rural, the red is the urban and it's cross the halfway mark and it is heading towards this 80% mark very rapidly. And that is represented by its claim to be building two to 300 new cities in the next 15 to 20 years, each and excess of a million people. So the stress and strain on energy resources, uh, and in particular on the social fabric are phenomenal. And this is just China. Uh, we have India, we have Latin America, and of course we have Africa.

Speaker 3:          06:04          And of course, all of this is a reflection of this incredible, super exponential growth. The population. I, um, you know, that's, this is, this begins when we started to urbanize when we stopped being hunter gatherers and, uh, you know, it's, it's sort of extraordinary. I look at this graph and I'm looking up there. Um, uh, I was born in 1940 where there were just over 2 billion people on the planet. There's now seven and a half million, and by the time many of you are dead, uh, it will be 10 to 12 million. So that's unbelievable. And so somehow we've got to sort of think of this in much bigger terms then what its effect is even just on global warming or in the environment or on a health and energy. And so we're going to, we need to sort of develop a much bigger picture. And all of this is manifested again in this idea of open ended growth, which has been so extraordinarily successful and, and bringing us to this point.

Speaker 3:          07:02          And just to give another marker, another metric of it, this is the growth in the US GDP. Um, since roughly the civil war, if you didn't invested $1 in the, in the, in the stock market in about 1870, it would now be worth $1 million even allowing for inflation. So this is just a metric of the extraordinary expansion of the economy. Now all of this is bound up with the development of cities, the urbanization that I talked about briefly. So one can immediately identify that the fate of the planet, you tell me what to press, it's marvelous that this is happening. I love it. This is the problem. I do the stories. I could telegraph my, the way I gave a talk at the Google and then mountain view about five years.

Speaker 3:          07:59          And uh, you know, I'm very old fashion. I've got three times as old as most seizures cause I can tell. But, uh, I, uh, I said a young coming and then two days before four, I said, um, uh, they said, send us the, uh, you know, the PowerPoint. Say PowerPoint. Just be kidding. I said, I haven't been to transparencies. I know I'm going to go back. And they said, what's that? I explained and you know, they had to go out and Google had to go up and buy the overhead projector so I can give my tour, which was, oh, we, I can just talk. Maybe I'll just have to talk. If you don't mind. I'll use my PowerPoint as notes to just talk. You were Miss Graphs and yours is going to have to use your vivid imaginations. So, let's see. So I'd love to be pictures of cities.

Speaker 3:          08:56          So, so the point is that the future of the planet is now really the future of the cities of the future decisions in the future of the planet. The fate of the planet is completely intertwined when what's happening in cities. And uh, so there is an urgent need to develop a deep understanding of cities, not just a qualitative narrative version of cities, which is been the traditional way of thinking about cities, but fire, urban geography, urban planning, urban economics, but some of the more scientific viewpoint and ask, is it even possible? Is it possible to have that? Is it possible to develop a science of cities that could lead to an understanding, their structure, their dynamics, that growth and evolution so that we can understand likewise the growth. That's the socioeconomic I economic life that we've developed and lead into what I've tried to term a sort of, so to speak of grand unified theory of sustainability. So, um, that's been been, uh, that's been my passion for the last several years. And, um, uh, you know, we all understand why cities are very attractive. You know, it's a place where there's greater opportunities, there's great a buzz, there's more cultural events. Um, there's greater access to good restaurants and so forth. And this has been the great attractor. Is it an account? And I've marvelous pictures.

Speaker 3:          10:36          Um, but you know, all of this, all of the marvelous things. And look, you, I mean, my God, you live in one of the most energetic cities on the planet. I mean, [inaudible] my God, I was looking at all the construction downtown. It's, it's phenomenal. Um, and um, uh, but all of that requires energy. So fundamentally at some fundamental level, obviously energy has to come in. And I'm sure most of you are familiar with the second or third dynamics, um, which says roughly speaking, that a, if you try to create lots of border, then you pay, oh, sorry.

Speaker 3:          11:16          Okay. So one second. Let me see where I can. Okay. So that's what I was saying. I didn't, uh, and similar, and this is just the images of the images of why cities are exciting and important, but all of that requires energy. And as I said, you know, from the second law of thermodynamics, which afterwards, the most fundamental law or physics, it's the one thing that is immutable, uh, creating order necessarily produces disorder, producers, entropy. And uh, so in creating cities and creating socioeconomic order, we of course, crepes, economic entropy, which means that we have, we create things like this and this and this, this and this. And of course it, this social unrest and so on. All of these are created by this extraordinary phenomenon and much of what's going on in the world in terms of, uh, this kind of unrest in even if it's, it's put in cultural and political and ethnic terms is almost certainly a large part of that is just due to this extraordinary phenomenon that's going on.

Speaker 3:          12:24          And one of the questions to ask is this, is, is this what cities are going to end up looking like? Is it all going to end up being sort of slums and so forth, which is happening in many parts of the world or even this. Uh, and so that's what I want to sort of lead up to. So you know, when we think of cities, and I just been talking about Seattle moment ago, you sort of, the image is one of the physicality of the city that is the infrastructure, the roads, the, the buildings and so forth. When you think of Paris, you think of the Eiffel Tower and the boulevards and so forth. I think New York skyscrapers, but in fact most important part of the city is of course the people. Because the whole point of the city is people and the whole point of the city, it's the fist facilitate interactions like this.

Speaker 3:          13:12          So this is really what you should think of as a city. That there's the backdrop, the physicality, the roads, and the uh, transport systems. And the buildings are really the stage upon which interaction takes place. And there's a marvelous picture of Rome where you see that the backdrop has been there for 2000 years. People have changed, but there's still a place to provide interaction. And there's a marvelous picture of New York hundred 20 years ago or so. And you can viscerally feel, um, you know, the entrepreneurship, the idea creation and so forth that's taking place there. And a, this is what city is a foreign. Again, those buildings are still there. The people are no longer there. There's different people. They're not on the streets, they're in buildings. But those buildings and that stage is to facilitate interaction, to create wealth, to create ideas, to innovate and so on. Places like this. That's what sentence of four. So I'm one of the dynamics, uh, any socioeconomic system when in fact of any complex system is the tension between the physicality, this physicality, the energy and the resources, the buildings in this case. Um, uh, but the flow of energy, the metabolism of the system, um, uh, the, the tension between that and the information exchange that goes on between parts. Yup.

Speaker 3:          14:43          Can I wait till the end? And I bring that up again because that's very, uh, that's a, um, a very challenging, has been a question for, you know, what is the city and we'll come back to that, but I need to go through stuff and then I will give you a definition of a city, an operational definition. So there's this tension between, so to speak, the feminine dynamics of the Information Exchange, uh, that those pictures we show. So that show that, um, and also the recognition that, uh, almost all the problems that we face, whether it is global warming or it's the question of, uh, you know, do we have enough energy and enough resources, questions of trying collusion, health and so on. All these are generated in an urban environment primarily. And so, uh, organization can be thought of as the source of the tsunami of problems that we face across the planet, but they're also the solution because of the very reasons I said earlier. They are magnets, uh, that's or vacuum cleaners that suck up the smart people or the, uh, you know, almost all the great ideas and what's all the wealth that's created is created in some kind of urban environment. And associated with that is that all of these various things, this is just an, uh, an incomplete laundry list of many things that are part of associate economic system. Uh, let's see. She like, yeah, I'm going to press that, that no, I'm not just good at flipping transparency as a parent.

Speaker 3:          16:30          Okay. So an important aspect, you know, typically we treat each one of these roughly speaking autonomously or semi autonomously. That is a, you know, like we think only of global warming and we only think of energy or the only thing, health issues and so on. But all of these are themselves highly complex systems. They're each adapting and evolving and they're all most importantly interacting with each other. And so, um, if you only treat one and only think of one and stave stayed quite stove pipe, you have the, the classic problem of all kinds of unintended consequences because of the neglected interactions with everything else. So it's very important to develop a, an integrated, bigger picture in order to see all these things as part of an integrated whole. So now I'm going to switch gears and I'm going to talk a little bit about biology as a way to leading back into some of these questions of cities and ultimately that of companies and then sustainability.

Speaker 3:          17:37          So, um, uh, first of all, if you're going to have a science of one of these systems, kind of physics of a city, there's no way that there's a Newton's laws of cities that meaning that a bunch of principles from which you can calculate anything so that, uh, uh, you know, physics is best represented by the fact that we can, we know the position of a satellite to almost any degree of accuracy so that we can use our cell phones. And bounce things off and the whole it enterprise could work. But that works because we can do that to any degree of accuracy. But the idea that you could do that in a complex adaptive systems lot such as an organism or a city as clearly extremely unlikely. Nevertheless, you could have a theory that is what I will call core screen. That is you can get the generic properties of the system will understand those.

Speaker 3:          18:35          So there's kind of an in between of not being able to address any of the questions to having something predictable to any degree of accuracy. Maybe we can predict some coarse grained low resolution, uh, characteristics of these systems. So his, um, an example, first question, why do we live a hundred years and not a thousand? So we're, why is it that I can say with absolute certainty, everybody in this room will be dead in a hundred years? Um, where in the hell does that hundred years come from? Why isn't it a thousand years as I say here on million years or just 10 years? Why isn't everybody dead already like a mouse? If you're all mice by the way, mice, tissue mice, uh, almost identical to ours. So why is it the bed dead? They would all be dead if he were all mice. So why is that? Where does that number come from?

Speaker 3:          19:29          How is it generated from mini color scales or um, why, why is it that most of us had to sleep with the order of eight hours last night? Why not 15 or 16? One can mounts or three or four, like an elephant has to see three or four years and the way you're learning a couple of hours. So we're in the hell do those numbers come from? What is, what is the dynamic that's giving rise to those? And um, uh, so these are coarse grained questions and the answers will be caused, screened. The idea that you can predict the lifespan of a particular individual is, maybe you could do it with some probability, but the idea that you can predict it accurately is clearly not feasible. So similarly, when we move into the socioeconomic things, I'll citizen companies, just large organisms they came out of biology is, you know, to what extent is Google or Seattle biological, um, and why is it that a given that, that we all die, which you've already talked about, but all companies die.

Speaker 3:          20:30          But cities almost never do. It's almost impossible to kill the city. You can think of cities that have died, but to modern times you could do dropped atom bombs on cities and uh, 25 years later they're fine. Whereas a small fluctuation, relatively speaking in the stock market and you lose, lose a twa or Lehmann brothers, et cetera. So companies are, are fragile, cities are very resilient. And you could ask, could you get a series of components and could you predict? And here you're going to throw me out when Google would disappear, as I will show you a whole companies eventually will like human beings. So there's just a picture. So you know what happens here or what happened here for crying out loud.

Speaker 3:          21:20          Mick Jagger lie have it to come from the same part of London are the same age. So they, uh, so here's the, here's we, one of these. We want to, we are a mammal. And despite the fact that, uh, you know, we look very different, we looked different from them and they look different for each other and they, uh, they're in their immediate environment is quite different. It swims in the ocean and discoveries around, we brought on two links, nevertheless to an extraordinary degree of accuracy, 18 90%. We are actually scaled versions of one another. When you look at anything that you can measure about the many thing physiological or anything about their life history. So for example, here's the most fundamental quantity. It's called metabolic rate and then how much food you need to eat per day to stay alive. And that's plotted on the vertical axis.

Speaker 3:          22:12          And on the horizontal axis is the size and it's partially logarithmically up by factors of 10. And what you see is something extraordinary. Here's the most, probably the most complex phenomenon in the universe, metabolism, taking stuff and making it into life. Yet despite it being so extraordinary complex and despite the fact that each one of these organisms as evolved by natural selection with its own unique history, each subcomponent, each organ of these systems, each cell type is genome, has evolved with its own unique history, in which case you see this idea of so randomness of natural selection, in which case when you plotted something like this, you expect these points to be all over this graph. They've all lined up on a very simple straight line when plot it in this way, and of course you plotted logarithmically at first because you got a mouse in an elephant.

Speaker 3:          23:07          If you tried to put the mouse here and you wanted to put the elephant on the same graph and it were linear, of course it would be somewhere, I dunno. In Tacoma. Yes. Anyway, so this is a way of getting it on that side, on the same graph. And you can see there's an extraordinary regularity, extorting irregularities, even more amazing when you realize that the slope of this line is less than one because if it were one, you sort of vaguely understand it because if it were linear, you said where he doubled the size of an organism, you've doubled the number of cells. Therefore you double the amount of energy that's needed. Not the case at all. The slope of is I've written down is very close to the 0.75 and three quarters so that every time you double you actually saved about 25% so there's an extraordinary economy of scale as you go up in signs.

Speaker 3:          23:58          So elephant is more economic, it's cells work less hard than yours, but yours was work less hard than your cats for example. So those two things are actually scaled version to one another. So there it is, I said it again there, but most importantly in addition to this is that this is true of any physiological or life history event. Here's a mundane one. This is heart rate, your heart rate. And you can see again, it's a pretty good straight line on this log log part. And the slope of this is close to minus one quarter minus because it's negative and his, you, this is your white matter, the gray matter in your brain. This is the um, uh, the, the cable is versus the, uh, the operating part. And you can see this fantastic straight line. This is good. This is very close to five quarters is jeans and there's more fluctuations here, but the slope is very close to one quarter.

Speaker 3:          24:58          And so what you see emerge from this is this incredible, um, simplicity underlying this extraordinary complexity. Um, uh, with something also amazing is that all of these seem to have slopes that are simple multiples of this number one, quarter four plays some fundamental role in all of biology. So when I could spend the rest of the afternoon showing you 75 or some of these damn graphs of almost everything that can be measured looks like this. Um, now this is not exactly an equation, but I decided to leave this in any way. This, actually, this actually is a copy of a transparency I showed at that. Google they, that's why I put it in. So, um, so, so I said heart rates decrease. That's what that symbol means decrease. We're in that, we're plotting it with a slope of one quarter, but it turns out lifespan.

Speaker 3:          25:59          How long you live approximately increases increases with that slope of one quarter. So if you multiply these two things together, the increase of lifespan going with plus one quarter, the heart rate decreasing with one quart, you multiply them together, the one quarters cancel. So heart rate times lifespan is an invariant. Doesn't change what circle, but what is heart rate times lifespan is the number of heartbeats in a lifetime. And that's the same for all of us, which is spiritually beautiful and scientifically challenging to understand. And that number is about one and a half billion times and is the data and see, so this is number beats for lifespan versus the size and rotten that's I can, those are quickly do the calculation. We are an exception for very good reasons which have had had time. I will come back to it at the end. So what the hell?

Speaker 3:          27:00          Where the hell do all these extraordinary scaling laws come from? What is it that's driving them? What is it that's constraining the randomness and chaotic nature of natural selection? And the idea that I developed with some marvelous biologist was an underlying them is something that's common to all these systems and is common in fact or socio economic systems. And that is that you've got to, you have huge numbers of components and you have to service, those were the cells, customers or workers you have to serve as those in a roughly speaking, democratic, inefficient manner. And you do that of course by networks. And those networks are typically branching hierarchical networks. So the idea is that networks underlying this, and it is the mathematics and physics of these networks, these networks, there's different kinds. There's that's you. This is also you that your brain as the white to grey, right?

Speaker 3:          28:02          This is also you, that's inside yourselves. And that that's a mitochondria inside the cell. Now own networks. And the idea is that even though these networks have different physical structures, the mathematics and the generic principles underlying the structure and dynamics of flow on these networks are universal and generic. Okay. So, um, so now you have this theory that, uh, where you understand all of these, uh, the list of scaling of all of these, but you also have a theory for understanding how these networks work, not only the structure that is, if you wanted to ask me what is the radius length blood flow rate a stress on the 12th branch of your arterial network. There's a formula in my office, you can put in the numbers but in the program and you'll get the right answer for a cat, a dog, a hippopotamus, whenever. So it's, it's quite powerful. And, uh, once you have such a theory, you can apply it to many things. And some of them are things that I talked about, which I'm not going to talk about now, like aging and sleep. But some things I will talk about very briefly is growth because, uh, that's, that's crucial in your development obviously. And it's come up with something maybe that I just saw an opening. Yes, you gotta Ah, they are that you. So how did you grow? Let's do this quickly before I go.

Speaker 3:          29:42          Um, so what is that? So you eat lunch, you're metabolize the food. Uh, it turns it into ATP molecules that carry your energy and that gets delivered through the networks to yourselves at the cells. It repairs and maintains them. It replaces those that have died and then grows new ones. So there's the equation in English, it's some goes to maintenance and some goes to growth. And by the way, uh, I was in, in a few minutes, I'll do this for cities and companies. And it's the same equation basically. I mean, you have to adjust what you mean by these things, but it's fundamentally the same if you do that and you put that into mathematics, that English into mathematics with this, the, the, the theory that has been developed. Then here's an example of this is our growth. Our meaning mammals is a rat and a, these are data points.

Speaker 3:          30:39          And that's the prediction of the theory. And amazingly with the same parameters, the same few parameters like the of a sale and so on. You can predict the growth curve for any animal and then the theory tells you how to rescale all those results. I could have shown you lots of those growth goals so that everybody has to grow in the same way. And here's just some small sampling of those. You see they all grow. They all fit on the same universal curve that is predicted by the theory, even by the way cancer tumors, which are we'll come back to in a minute. But the important thing is there's a universal theory for growth and most importantly for what I want to say is that in explains why it is that you grow quickly at the beginning and something that should have maybe bothered you.

Speaker 3:          31:28          Why is it they should go on eating, which you don't go on growing. I mean you, you do, I mean a little bit this way, but you don't grow what's called onto genetically. You stay pretty much the same size. And then you have this stable configuration you get into. And by the way, this, this idea that most organisms reach a stable size and stop growing is crucial. And the sustainability of life and why life has been around for two to 3 billion years. Uh, and of course just jumping ahead, this is terrible. When you think of an economy or a company or a city you're supposed to be, you know, you're not supposed to go bend over like that. It's not supposed to start. And, and what is also very important is the reason, if you trace back why is you stopped growing. It is intimately related to this what I called sub linear scaling.

Speaker 3:          32:25          The fact that metabolic rate scaled with an exponent, meaning that slope of that graph with less than one, the three quarters was crucial that it goes, this bends over. And I could elaborate on that. Anyone's interested later. So there's, it's still showing great. So here's a summary. Some biological things. We have these extraordinary scaling ignores their nonlinear. There's these quarter pounders and expresses an economy of scale. The bigger you are, the message needed per cell per capita to stay in line. Uh, I didn't emphasize this, but going along with that sub linear scaling is that the pace of life systematically slows heart speed, slower oxygen diffuses across membranes, uh, slower. You live longer. And in fact you could contract a elephants life completely down so that it overlaps exactly that of a mouse if you follow the scheme north. Um, I said growth stocks, growth stocks, and I only intimated it you die when Ben Ben's over.

Speaker 3:          33:30          Stop growing and then you die. Okay, let's use this now as a point of departure to talk about cities. So I said this already. First question is, is scaled versions of one another. Is Seattle justice scaled down New York City, which is a scaled up Santa fe where I live or scaled down Chicago or they scaled version one, but it sure as hell don't look alike. They have different histories, cultures, geographies and so on. On the other hand, um, their own network systems, roads and electrical lines and so on, their transport systems and the supplied by energy networks. And perhaps most importantly, that I emphasized earlier. Um, they will have people in them and, uh, people form social networks. It's a classic social network, social network nodes of people. And those are the interactions. You're probably more familiar with this than I am, but these are social networks.

Speaker 3:          34:31          Um, and two points I want to emphasize about this. One is that there's a modularity to these networks generally because people have families and they have jobs with groups and departments and so on. So people have said it's not just individuals, but we formed groups of various sizes and most importantly illustrated on this. You know, we tend to draw pictures like this when we do our network theory. Um, but we tend to forget, especially when used words like the cloud, that all of these have to be somewhere. People have to be actually somewhere when they're on their iPhone or on their computer or whatever, doing Facebook. They have to be, you know, on a road in the office, in the bathroom somewhere. They have to be. So they are glued, people are glued whether they like it or not to being in place. So there's an integration between place and information.

Speaker 3:          35:30          So are they, are cities scaled versions one or the other. But here's some first data that we look at and this was something mundane. This is gas stations petro here because these people I worked with where we're at the eth in Zurich, uh, and uh, you can see this is a, there's four European cities and you've seen bay scale pretty well. And the dotted line is the youngest like biology, it's sub linear. That is the bigger the city, the less gas stations needed per capita. Not Surprising, but what is surprising is there are roughly the same slope, meaning that you're saying the same amount every time you double, no matter where you are. And that is about 15%. The slope of this is about point a five rather than 0.75 in biology. Furthermore, if you look at any infrastructure that is, if you look at the length of all the roads, you look at the length of all the electrical lines, the power, the, the how many mortar lines, the gas line, whatever, whatever you can measure about infrastructure.

Speaker 3:          36:32          They all have this character, they all scale in this way. They all scare with the same smoke about 0.85 and it's the same, not just in these four European cities for European countries, but across Europe, across the United States, across China, across Japan, Colombia, Chile, wherever, wherever you can get data and look exactly like this, all infrastructure scales in the same way. And one interesting consequence of that is in a sense, you get this economy of scale. That means the bigger the city, the less entropy that is produced. And therefore it's up here. The carbon footprint gets lower per capita, the bigger the city. So the greenest city in the United States is New York City and one of the shittiest in that sense, a Santa fe where I live, even though it's in Delek compared to living in New York. So, uh, that's fantastic. But what is even more amazing is if you look at socioeconomic wants.

Speaker 3:          37:33          It is things that never existed until we started learning language and building communities and ultimately cities, things like wages and something called someone named Richard Florida called super creative people like everybody here, professional people. If you ask how does that scale with city size parked it in the same logarithmic boy, then you get a similar as more fluctuations, more noise, but you get scaling but you get a slope. There is now bigger than one. It's called Super Linear scaling, which means that instead of every time where as you increase, you get an economy of scale. The bigger you are, the less per capita for socioeconomic quantities, wages, super creative people. Bigger you are the more per capita and the slopes of these are quite similar around 1.15 what is amazing is that that's the same for most everything else. I didn't write it on here. This is the patents produced as a function of synthesize size.

Speaker 3:          38:32          This is just over 1.15 this crime in Japan there's a bit bigger. This is police tax receipts, construction restaurants and Holland and so on. And here's just a small panel of half a dozen of these different variables whose wages are just showed you. Here's the GDP of France is crime in Japan. And you can see they all have pretty much the same slope so that any socio, not socio economic variable, no matter what it is, no matter where it is across the globe scales in the same way, which is sort of extraordinary because there wasn't a congress in 1782 where all the countries of the world decided this is how we're going to build cities and this is how I'm going to build our socioeconomics system. And all evolved organically and amazingly out of all that came something universal and similar. Um, and here's just for the United States, this is just income, GDP.

Speaker 3:          39:30          Private patents readjusted but to the same scale, but send, you can see the same slope. There's quite a bit of noise in it, but you can see overall it's the same kind of thing. And one of the big questions is, when the hell does all this come from, why is, why should that be? So here it is in English. Uh, if you double the size of a city, you know, give an urban system on average, uh, systematically the income, well, number of colleges, educational places created people, but also all these bad things, please aids, flu, crime, social and oh, these things all increased by about 15% and at the same time you save 15% on own infrastructure. So big cities a good, if you sort of ignore this, which people are very good at suppressing crime, pollution, disease, a big cities, a good and big bigger cities, even better.

Speaker 3:          40:25          So we're in the hell. Does all this come from? So you ask yourself, what is universal about all cities? What is common across all cities? And what you quickly realize. There's something I've emphasized earlier. The thing that's common is that they are for people, and it may sound sort of obvious, but amazingly, if you become familiar with urban planning, urban architecture of an economics, what you discover is people rarely play any role in those. Those subjects was dominated by the physicality and pure economics of the system. And so the idea is in is the universality of the mathematics and physics of social networks. The interaction of people do this underlying this. And I don't have time again to go into any of the mathematics and the details of this to show you where it comes from. Uh, but um, one thing I will show you is the following, one crucial thing of course about science is not just to have a theory that explains the observations, but to predict things.

Speaker 3:          41:26          And a, so I'm going to be one prediction that you can make without having to see the theory just based on that idea. That's what I just showed you. And the idea is that the, the universality of that is because of the universality of human interactions. Uh, so if we could measure the number of the interaction between people as a function of city size, it should track this. Okay. So how do you do that? Well, that's been very hard until recently, but now everybody carries of course, cell phone, which means everybody has a little detective with them. Sure you're very familiar with, with like maybe probably exploited in many ways, I'm sure. Uh, but everybody has one. And so it's like, it's like the molecules in this room, of course, it's almost as if everyone is tagged so we know exactly where it is, you know, where it's moving with interacting with and so on.

Speaker 3:          42:23          So with some colleagues at MIT, we were able to get hold of this data of billions and billions of a cell phone calls between people in various places and then just, uh, do the analysis and count, uh, how the number of interactions between people scope, city size. And by the way, an interaction was I call you. And within six months you call me back. So we have a relationship now, six months, if you could make it three months, you can make it through. It's up to you. But, um, we to establish an interaction, a relationship. So we did that. And here's the result. And you see down the bottom and you see it's not the same slope as this. And there's two countries on this planet. One is the UK and the other is Portugal. And you can see it agrees with the predictions. So it's very strong evidence that underlying this is and this theory of social networks.

Speaker 3:          43:16          Now I'm going to finish off very quickly. I've gone too long being delayed by some of this, but I'll try to finish off very quickly. Um, first of all, I mentioned earlier that the network dynamics in biology leads to the slowing of the pace of life. That's the sub linear, the three quarters, the super linear behavior of socioeconomic metrics and the network underlying it. And by the way, I should say one thing about the network. The super linearity comes about because of the positive feedback loops that we create. When we interact. I talked to you, you have a discussion that you talked to him and then we three have a discussion and a blood. It's what goes on here. Of course, that's what makes the whole system work. And that has this positive exponentiate eating behavior, which leads to the super linear behavior. That's sort of the words for the mathematics that goes into this.

Speaker 3:          44:08          Uh, but that leads also has this curious thing that if you have the superintendent behavior and sort of the pace of life slowing down, it speeds up in a predictable fashion and his, so we've looked at many things that in his one whimsical one, this is heart rates, this is biology decreasing with sides. This is walking speed in cities as a function of size. And this is pushing the theory a little bit, but you know, you're still part of a network when you're walking and you can see it's as fluctuations. This is ancient data by the way. It wasn't part of this this way, but you can see it's very good. And that was, that was basically the, that was the prediction from the theory. And interestingly, here's something that I found in a British newspaper a few months ago. This is the city of Liverpool. And here's what it says underneath, there's amazing research revealed almost half the nation fouled the slow pace of high streets to be the biggest shopping bugbear, not that noise and the pollution and all the rest. It's the other fucking people going too slow. Sorry.

Speaker 3:          45:22          Take it as frustration. And here it is. So here is a fast lane. They put a fast lane for walkers. There's just from as a niche, that was the first thing they did it. So I'm going to miss this and marvelous quote here. Oh here's something I see you buying the iPhone five and then shortly after Apple Watch and some old one, the iPhone six and then we've got the bloody iPhone seven driving us nuts. Okay, onward. So here's the growth equation. I want to go quickly through growth. So it's the same kind of thing. I sent it earlier. You know what you have to cost. No, you got to add up everything that's coming in and some goes to maintain everything that's here or maintain all the city streets and the roads and maintain all the people and some roads grows new infrastructure and roads, new people and so on.

Speaker 3:          46:16          So you have to put that on. This is just a cartoon of it and you're taught them to mathematics. And when you, when you did an embark, Jim got this, you saw, but now the input, all of this is super linear and that instead of giving rise to this, which would be a disaster in a socioeconomic system from our modern capitalist viewpoint you get, and I just do cartoon versions of this to give you an idea, it gives you something very satisfying, gives you this faster than exponential growth, which is what we've seen and I'm not going to have time to show you all the data that agrees with this and that's fantastic. So it's very satisfying. The theory is very self consistent and is very predictive, but it has a fatal flaw. And you've heard this in different forms. I'm sure that fatal flaw is this Duffy line because what the theory says is that you go to an infinite size of whatever the metric is that y'all are looking at in a finite time.

Speaker 3:          47:14          This is called mathematically a finite time singularity. That's obviously nonsense. You can't have an infinite number of AIDS cases or infinite number of a infinite amount of wages or whatever you them to. So somewhere along here, something changes. And the theory tells you that the theory tells you what happens is that as you approach that singularity, the system stagnates and then it collapses. That's what I'd done yet. So just symbolically written it here. And that's terrible. Of course. And that's what we don't want. Uh, and so the question is how do we avoid it? Well, we avoided as we're going along here, when you realize that of course it's growth was done within a certain set paradigm. Certain major innovation, we discover cold. What we discovered iron 20,000 years ago or whenever it was a, we invented computers, we discovered it. Whatever it is, something is, it sets the, so to speak the backdrop for this.

Speaker 3:          48:16          So it's clear. If you want to have open endedly group continue up in any growth somewhere along here before stagnation and collapse sets in, you better start over again. And you do that by major innovation. So innovation, nothing new is the thing that resets the clock and you can start over again and avoid the collapse inherent in that senior narrative. So you start over again, a book off you go and that's great. But there's a not the singularity is going to come cause the same dynamic. So you better do it again. Sorry. It didn't, somehow that's supposed to be there. Uh, and so on. I'm sorry. Then what happened here. Yeah, but you get the idea. So you had this idea. So you have a theorem you can produce. If you want to have open ended growth, you have to have continuous cycles of paradigm shifting innovations.

Speaker 3:          49:13          Great. However, is the hitch. I said, if you go along one of these curves, my wife gets faster, life is speeding up. But along with that, the time between these innovations as the systematically and predictably get shorter and shorter. So the time between innovations, uh, necessarily get shorter. And uh, so just to make up some numbers, if it took a hundred years to make a major change a thousand years ago, now it only takes 15 to 20 years. And so indeed the, uh, the time between, you know, so to speak, computers, laptops, and uh, it was maybe 20, 30 years. I know, whatever. And so what this says is if you want to avoid collapse, you got to do it again. You've got to do it soon. If I told the analysis shows you've got to do another major innovation analogous to it in the next 20 years, and we can speculate as to what that might be.

Speaker 3:          50:15          If not, we're going to have a potential crisis on our hands. Now, this is not my, I don't know who this guy is, but I picked it off, but, uh, I, I got permission to use it. Uh, it's, uh, but it's someone that did some analysis. I'm just tying to reach 10 million customers just to give you a sense. And it's very similar. And then, you know, very cuts while has, has a different view of the singularity likes the singularity, but the singularity is sort of like the coming of the Messiah, uh, whereas I see a quite the opposite. But this is his graph actually. And a, what you see is that in line is, uh, what's plotted here is, um, along here, how long ago and innovation took place of cells took place a billion years ago almost. Uh, but, uh, how long it took to make the change in the news Billy news ago.

Speaker 3:          51:09          Now it's, you know, 15 years, 15 years ago. So, and you can fit it all on the logarithmic plot. This line is exactly what's predicted by this theory. You know, I just tried to outline for you, so I'm going to finish up very quickly, extremely quickly. Um, and I leave hanging. The question is to, you know what, what, let's go back to this. What happens here? You know, the question of collapse, Ultima collapse. Because if you take the argument to its absurd conclusion, you would have to be making a major paradigm shift every two years, then read one year and then every six months, obviously not. So something has to, as the change. Okay? So I want to finish off extremely quickly with a, if I can get there with companies. So here's a, here's a summary. I'm just some cub. I mean I can show you all the data if anyone's interested with companies and what's plotted here.

Speaker 3:          52:10          Assets and income. Just to give you a sense, the important take home messages here and what this is, I think this is Walmart is one of the, uh, and you see this some fluctuations here, but you see this is party versus number employees. These a tiny companies of 10 to a hundred people. But once it gets to be a substantial size, they followed the scaling pretty well. And the important thing about this that it's sub linear. It's not like it's more like us. It is not like, um, cities. And if you follow the argument through, and this is what I'm going to zoom, what did that say? It said that you stopped growing and your die. Okay? So let's look at that. Here's the data. This is 30,000 US publicly traded companies from 1950 to 2010, just all on one plot. Big Spaghetti plots, every single one, okay.

Speaker 3:          53:08          And uh, what you see is what you sort of know here. They're all these new ones and human fucking stupid zooming away. But look at these old farts, they just sort of hanging in there and it's going along the top like that. Now they are this. And then as you see inflation's been taking out on this, so the old farts like me and this on limping along and all the young Turks like you're zooming and forth and here it is readjusted to the stock market, the GDP. And there it is. And you can see the dead flat, which means that a big enough fluctuation of the stock market and you're in trouble. That's one reason why companies die. And I won't go. I don't have time in this cause I've gone on too long to tell you about the dynamic of that. That red line, by the way, it's daunting going along.

Speaker 3:          54:02          And I can tell you about Boeing cause I've worked with boy. Um, so here's the growth. That's Walmart looking like a big hockey stick. But you notice it only goes in 1994 and here it is, take into 2008 and that red line is a prediction of this theory. And you can see it's beginning to bend over. And we'll go the way of all companies. It will join. It is already joining this, this lot and we'll bend over and the question is, will eventually die. And this is what this last graph is. This is plotted, um, what's just focus on one of these. This is the probability of dying versus the company age and it's broken down into companies of different sizes. And this is divided into those that disappear through acquisition and merger. Those be bankruptcy and liquidation. But this is one see 100% probability. So it's very unlikely.

Speaker 3:          55:05          It's very rare for a company to live a hundred years, you know, I need to do of the, um, and it's very rare for a company to go two to 300 years. Um, and uh, I don't, I don't have time to discuss that. I discuss it in the book. I discussed lots of investigations to be done in an ansys be done. So our finished there, um, I didn't complete everything, but I want to show you one last graph. I went on way too long. Uh, there's this one, one thing I didn't say when we were discussing metabolism is that, you know, what is sitting here desperately waiting for me to finish is operating at 90 watts. So you're, that's all you're using. You know, like you use my Nike ones and what says on this grant is that if you think of your, that's how you evolve that you are as a biological animal and Mammo, the fits perfectly on that metabolic rate.

Speaker 3:          55:57          But if you ask the question how much energy you need to stay alive with the kind of socioeconomic activity you do, the kind of quality and standard of living you have, that number is 11,000 months. So that's equivalent to each one of us in this room is acting as if we are about a dozen elephants or about 70% of a blue one, which is almost as big as this whole many. And uh, you know, most people, the seven and a half billion people on this planet and all of them, all of them want to be like us. They all want to live it never thousand watts. So this is a huge pressure. So, um, uh, I haven't, uh, I, I'm sort of stopped at before telling you some speculations about, uh, you know, survival and collapsed by viability, sustainability. But this is just puts the numbers and to a perspective. So I finished that and I'm sorry, I went on for too long. Some of it was due to this and some was my home profligacy and, uh, just getting carried away. So thank you.

Speaker 2:          57:03          [inaudible] sleep

Speaker 3:          57:10          promote. I didn't rose. I put this up here. It's all in the book, but no equations.
