Speaker 1:          00:05          I said, welcome Dr Starkey. Thank you. Uh, I know that we want to get to the point of talking about how these things are going to kill all of us and we're all doomed. Uh, but before we do that, before we get started about that, we should, we should talk a little about about what these things are that are going to kill us all. Um, so, uh, your, your book of course is a, a nonfiction book, but I couldn't help thinking while reading it, that if it were a novel, the main characters in it would be comets and asteroids. So maybe we should start there. Talk about a little bit about what comets and asteroids are and how they are different from each other.

Speaker 2:          00:34          Sure. Okay. So, um, I guess there's a lot of misunderstanding now about what the, what the differences between comments and asteroids. Um, so classically we had this idea that comments forms and the very cold outer reaches of the solar system. So when our son first formed, it was surrounded by this cloud of gas and dust and ice and way out in the outer reaches of the solar system. We pass where any of the planets are today. Um, we formed the comments and they're literally just like, as I describe it as like a scoop of this cloud, he'd basically just take this gas and dust and ice and kind of bind it together a little bit, but they're not very well like held together. They're not very well consolidated. So they're almost like a snowball essentially with a lot of Dustin. Um, but what why they're so important is that they're exceptionally old. So there was old as the sun, 4.6 billion years old, which means they can tell us a lot about where we came from, where everything in our solar system came from.

Speaker 1:          01:23          Right. Did they sort of primitive object.

Speaker 2:          01:24          Exactly. Um, whereas the asteroids are at hand, they're also very old with saying probably nearly 4.6 if not four, paid for just about 4.5 billion years old. And we can think of those as kind of the leftover building rubble from making the planet. So they formed in the inner solar system much closer to the sun, just as the rocky planets did like us and then mercury, Venus and Mars. Um, and it was just those bits and pieces of planet that didn't get made into a planet. They just got left out. And then they collected, um, in the asteroid belt, which is now between Mars and Jupiter. Um, so the asteroids are really important because they preserve this history of planet building, which is really hard to look at because if we just take earth, we've had all sorts of evolution on earth since it formed and we have plate tectonics as most people know.

Speaker 2:          02:07          So especially living in La, you probably know too well that was an earthquake last night actually, that, you know, our plates are moving and we create earthquakes and volcanoes and this changes the surface of our planet. So if we want to go back to the beginning of us, we want to see what it was made from and how it started out and how life got here and how our water got here. It's really hard to do. It's really hard to pick apart that history. So asteroids are really important in that sense. They can kind of allow us to, to glimpse back at that time because they didn't really evolve since the forms, not a whole lot anyway. They sort of preserve those conditions. So that's the classic view. I think we're going to come onto in a bit kind of how that view is maybe not so accurate now. It's not wholly wrong, but, um, but we've kind of updated our view about these objects, but we should remember that that's the classical distinction.

Speaker 1:          02:53          And I love that that image of the asteroids is kind of the leftover legos from the solar system. You snap the whole bunch of things together into planets and these are the ones that are kind of scattered on the floor.

Speaker 2:          03:02          Yep.

Speaker 1:          03:02          That's right. Yeah. Yeah. And, um, and so because these might might come into the picture as well, can we talk a little about what, uh, uh, meteors and meteorites and meteoroids are?

Speaker 2:          03:12          Yeah. So, okay. That there's a lot of confusion about that. So I, me to write is literally just a piece of rock from space on another planet. So on earth we can go and collect me, tried sitting on the ground. And it could be a piece of a planet, it could be a piece of a comment or an asteroid. And what happens is that collisions happening happen in space and they've happened for Millennia and little pieces of rocks will get knocked off planets. If another is an asteroid collides with them. And some of this asteroid might end up just floating about in space, but little pieces of it. So it's a meteoroid and space. And then when it comes through the atmosphere, it's becomes a mature. So you got, we had the meteor shower recently that you can see little pieces coming through often that stuff.

Speaker 2:          03:48          So when we get a big fireball, these beautiful scenes that we get, that's a larger piece of rock coming through. If that rock makes it to the surface, if it doesn't explode in the atmosphere and completely disintegrate a piece of rock on the surface as the meats, right? So the great thing about them is that we can collect them. Sometimes we can actually see them forward. If you see a fire ball, you can sometimes trace it and then find that fresh rock literally just straight from space and you can solve it. Or we get older falls where you know, there's a court fines where we've kind of, they felt while ago, it could be millions of years ago. Um, and we can then go and sample them. And it's great because it means we can get samples from space because we don't actually go into space very often.

Speaker 2:          04:27          Like we going to space a bit. And when we do, we often don't collect samples because if we want to go out and collect samples and spaces, almost like two missions. Do you want to like this? The why we haven't sampled Mars. And people find that quite surprising when I say we don't have any samples from Mars. We've been there a whole lot. There's loads of instruments on Mars, but we haven't brought back any, any rocks from there because yeah, right. So we need to, we will be, we will be doing it in the future. Right now at the moment, the only rocks we have from Mars Mitch Rights. So that's the only way we can sample them. They're free samples, which is great. Right? But we don't know exactly where they came from. So if we send a mission there, we consomme politically is that clean a particular base and that we're interested in and then we can bring that back. But that's basically a second mission to launch, relaunch off another planet or an asteroid or a comment. It's, it's really complicated. So that's why we haven't done it very often. Obviously we have a lot of samples from the moon, thank goodness. So that's right. Yeah, we've done it a bit, but we need to do it more. But we have meet traits in the meantime, which can really help us out. Right.

Speaker 1:          05:25          Okay. So the, so the asteroids all live, well not all live but mainly collected in the asteroid belt, which is this region between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. Yup. Um, and they're the asteroid belt, uh, I learned from your book isn't really all one thing, right? There's like an inner and an outer belt and there was a distinction between those two regions. You to talk about that.

Speaker 2:          05:44          Yes. So when we studied asteroids and asteroid belt, we kind of initially thought they were all going to be the same, just these kind of rocky objects that look a bit like, you know, failed planets and, and the small and they're all very small. There are a couple of large objects that, but actually when we look in detail from the inner belt, which is going to be the bit that's closer to Mars, I'm sure enough these things do look like asteroids. In fact, some of them are made completely of metals. So if you take the core of earth that is made of metal, we'll probably aware of that. But actually we can sample a sort of core from a planet if we sample some of these asteroids and there's a Nasa mission actually going, um, in the twenties, twenties called psyche and it's going to be going to look at one of these objects so we can sample those.

Speaker 2:          06:24          And they're very much like we consider the classical asteroids. But as we move out to the outer belts on that kind of Jupiter side, what we find is that they change and they actually become IC. Some of these objects and they have a lot of carbonaceous materials. So what I'm saying here is that we, we've got organic matter now that's not uncommon. We have organic matter in most of the asteroids apart from the ones that are really made of just a metal. Um, this isn't life. People get very excited when we see organic methods. It's not life. It's literally just carbon, hydrogen bonding and some oxygen and it's, it's organic matter that is potentially the precursor for life. So it's really exciting. These objects contain a lot of organic matter because we still don't understand how life got to earth. Um, we're obviously the only planet we know of that contains life.

Speaker 2:          07:07          Um, we don't know how I got here and it's kind of just, it's ridiculous, right? I always find it quite funny that we still don't know how we are here and we're like these very intelligent beings that can do all sorts of amazing things. But how we got her as a mystery. So we want to study these objects, um, to try and understand if they could have delivered life. So these asteroids on the outer belt, they also contain ice. So they look very much like the comments that I described at the beginning. And actually this is where this kind of distinction between the two objects breaks down a little bit because these actually might be comments when they formed. The idea is that some of them really could have formed in the outer solar system. And then there was a huge reorganization of the solar system after the large planets formed.

Speaker 2:          07:45          And some of these comments kind of got thrown into the inner solar system and got trapped in the asteroid belt. So we actually find that they're kind of comments, but they are asteroids. So it's kind of confusing in that respect. But the same happen the other way. Some of the asteroids that formed near the Sun got ejected out of the solar system. Some of them probably disappeared from our solar system completely and others ended up in one of their homes of where the comments live now. Um, so there's probably almost certainly some objects in what we call the Co, the quip about where Pluto lives, which probably asteroidal in origin, but now they're sitting somewhere very cold. So there is a bill. This is where kind of the overlap starts to happen, right, because the cell systems kind of crazy.

Speaker 1:          08:26          I love that image from your book of of Jupiter sort of throwing a tantrum and rampaging around the solar system and kind of throwing stuff all over the place and kind of mixing it all up so it's not in range, you know, and this kind of neat, tidy little categories that we thought at first.

Speaker 2:          08:37          I think that's the thing. We had this beautiful fee because of the solar system is very hard to understand. Obviously we need to visit it to understand it. And we haven't been too, I mean we've been to a lot of it, but we still don't know how all the planets formed. And Jupiter is enormous. Like it's, it really controls our solar system and it's gravity if it decides to move around, which he did in the past, um, can just really cause havoc throughout, you know, it can just not planets around and, and particularly smaller objects like asteroids. Um, so that is, that period of our solar system history is very, very crazy. Sorry.

Speaker 1:          09:08          Yeah, you talked about it yet. Swapping the orbits of Uranus and Neptune. So Neptune is further out currently and Uranus is closer in, but they were the other way around. This is what we think.

Speaker 2:          09:18          Yeah. And these are massive planets, you know, and, and they have huge gravity. So it's kind of crazy thing. And obviously it's not going to happen now, but what we can do now is look out to other solar systems around other planets, planetary systems, around other stars. And we can kind of look at what is happening now. So I love that. This is not my field, but this is astronomy and it's absolutely fascinating that we can look out and see, we can kind of see our solar system as it was billions of years ago because we can look at other stars and see actually planets forming at this very time, what kind of, what's happening here. So this is another way we can try and figure out what happened 4.6 billion years ago and afterwards. So it's fascinating.

Speaker 1:          09:54          Right on. Um, so, so in much the same way that the, there's a, there's these kind of two regions of the asteroid belt. There's kind of two regions of the, where the comments live as well. You talked about the Kuyper belt, which is the near region and there's also the Oort cloud because the farther region you want to talk about the distinction between those two regions as well. Yeah. How far away they are. Yes.

Speaker 2:          10:12          It's kind of crazy. Um, so this sentence is in space always. I think everyone just goes, oh yeah, it's pretty far. It's like really far to Jupiter and Pluto. We know he went to Pluto with the new horizons mission recently, and it's still going through the quip about, so you know, a couple of years later, I think it was 2015 it met three times. Um, and it's still going through the for bouts. So it is 25 times wider than the asteroid belt. And the asteroid belt is already fairly large. Right. And it's just in terms of distances, it's not that far. So it's just past Neptune Uranus. It's kind of just on the edge of the solar system. But these objects that are there that I see that dusty, the kind of mostly fairly small and we can see most of them, so we kind of know roughly what is there, but they're sort of bound to our son by the gravity.

Speaker 2:          11:01          They're not too far that they're not kind of bound west the system. But once you get to the edge of the quote about it sort of becomes no man's land. Um, we have a region called the stack scattered desk, which is just some random objects, which are probably mostly cometary. Um, and they're kind of on crazy orbits a little bit and we don't understand them a whole lot, but they are, we can't see all of them, but they're kind of, we know that they're there. But then we get to this theoretical phase of the solar system, which is the Oort cloud. Um, and I was fascinated to learn what I did a few years ago, that the Oort cloud is not proven like theoretical. And we always talk about all Clark comments and new day we have what we call long period comments, which are these comments that come into the inner solar system and orbit the sun.

Speaker 2:          11:43          Um, and they have to have more bits of more than 200 years. So the way we know that awkward is there, partly because we have to balance out the mass of the solar system somehow. So we kind of, you know, know guests there had to be something out there, but then we get these comments coming in at it, really round random angles into that. So basically I should probably just sidestep a little bit. The solar system, as most people know, all the planets on the same plane. And so as a quick about, so we're sort of all going around the sun and nicely, Pluto's doing something slightly different and then we move out to the Oort cloud. And this is literally a cloud around the whole sun. So what happens is, is one, one of these comments decides to come into the inner solar system.

Speaker 2:          12:20          They can come in from all random angles. They're not going to be coming along with that plane. So that's how we sort of know this cloud is there because these are the little visitors from the outer solar system come in and, and we can spot them, but we can't directly see them if they're there because they're just too far. Right. You know, these objects are tiny and they're too far away. So this is partly why until new horizons got to Pluto, we didn't really know much about it. Like we just could not really see it in any detail. So I'm really excited to see the next object is going to in the queef about, um, and then the Oort cloud. We just, I don't, you know, we're never going to get there in anyone's lifetime. It's just the spaceships. We'll continue going, but we are not going to know. They will run out of battery by then anyway, so, right. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          12:57          Doing the math on the numbers from your book. I got that light leaves the sun, it gets to the near edge of the Kuyper belt in four hours. Okay. So that's the Kuiper belt. It gets to the near edge of the Oort cloud and something like nine and a half months. Okay. That's the, that's the magnitude of the difference that we're talking.

Speaker 2:          13:12          Yep. And then the Oort cloud, it would take another t as the cross, right?

Speaker 1:          13:17          Yeah, exactly right. Yeah. It's like from one to three light years distance. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          13:23          Can just space cost speeds. I mean, this is going to take, um, hundreds of pounds, tens of thousands of years, I'm guessing. Yes.

Speaker 1:          13:29          Right. It's somewhere 40,000 years or something. Something along those lines. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          13:32          Sorry. It's the very far right. And actually had a reasonable labs, objects of batty bound to our son. They are actually influenced often by in the galaxy, the passing of other stars, like they can be knocked out of the orbit, um, by, you know, the literally other stars nearby because the almost closer to other solar systems or stars then. Right.

Speaker 1:          13:52          Those are the things I was fascinated when, just a little factoid, I was fascinated by from your book that that the, the outer edge of the Oort cloud, which is around our son is actually closer to the next star yeah. Than it is to our son.

Speaker 2:          14:03          But they are literally within our sales system. So it's, yeah, it's kind of where you define the edge of the solar system and there are different definitions for where it is, right. When you enter interstellar space, which is the bit in between the stars. Um, and so yeah, the voyager missions, which settled in the 1970s they are now in interstellar space, but that just means they are past the cliff about, right, right. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          14:24          Yeah. As long as you're talking about like awesome little facts from your book. Um, the, the, at this, this is the thing that that kind of blew my mind. The asteroid belt, all the asteroids from the asteroid belt put together would have less mass than Earth's moon. Yeah. Yeah. Which is very different from your picture of it is, you know, you think of the Millennium Falcon swimming through the asteroid belt in the asteroids are all kind of like huge and close together and yeah, but it's really kind of Nice guy. Hey, quiet

Speaker 2:          14:47          Scott's it out. And that's a good thing. Otherwise they would collide more often and we should have more issues in the inner solar system with potentially being hit by one. So actually it's a good thing that, that nicely far apart so you can get through quite easily. You can find a good route.

Speaker 1:          14:59          Well, well that's a, that's a nice little transition for us. Um, uh, so now that we know that we have a handle on kind of what all the players are, then comets and asteroids in the solar system and the media is of course, once they get here, um, let's talk about how they're going to kill us. All. Great. Yeah. So, so one of the things that you talked about in the book is, is you kind of point out that comets and asteroids give us, but they also take it the way that they might have brought life to earth. Um, but they also, you know, wiped out the dinosaurs and could do the same to us. Um, I'm, I'm a little hesitant to ascribe a properties like good and evil to inanimate objects like that. Maybe we should talk about them and helpful or scary, but how do you think about them? Do you think that there are things that should be revered or feared or

Speaker 2:          15:40          so, I mean, it was probably no surprise as somebody who's researched these objects quite a while that I revere them. Because one of the things about it is yes, they do have the potential to collide with us. And we think we see for about a hundred years. So probably all of us, unless you know how to live a lot longer than a hundred years, then you're going to be okay. But the thing is like our descendants going to be okay and the more we can learn about the subjects now, the better prepared we are to do something about one of them hitting us. So if we don't understand our enemy, then we don't know how to fight it. So I love these objects because they can tell us a lot about where we came from, about our past and how everything started in the solar system. But yeah, they do really have the potential to cause havoc.

Speaker 2:          16:20          Got a large asteroid could hit us, um, pass that a hundred years. I mean there's a chance one could hit us within a hundred years, but it's very unlikely pass that we at the moment don't know. It's a kind of a continuously updated list of potentially hazardous asteroids and comets, which you know, astronomy's or studying and they need to understand better how they move in on that orbits and what you know, the next orbit of the sun is going to do and if they're going to be altered by passing Jupiter in the future or something. So we need to understand exactly what they're doing, how they're spinning, and then we need to know what they're made of because if we don't know what they're made of, well some ideas like Armageddon, if you've seen the Hollywood movie right, they actually go and detonate some explosive inside the asteroid to blow it up. Well, it depends what you're dealing with. If this asteroid has made a pure metal that might not work, you might not even be able to drill into the thing too to put an, to put some exclusive with inside it. But if we talk about a comment well made, if it's coming towards earth, it might just explode on atmospheric entry anyway. So it's kind of like, okay, we need to know what we're dealing with if we want to go and deflect or destroy one before it gets here.

Speaker 1:          17:24          Right. And you talked about this some in the book that that, uh, even even blowing up the asteroid might not be good because now you have a whole bunch of asteroids that are going to kill you instead of one big Astoria.

Speaker 2:          17:33          Exactly. And I think one of the things is like the, the more advanced notice we get, the better. So if we can see that an object is heading for us and it's large, say a kilometer or so, um, and it's 10 years out, then we have time to launch a mission. This is why we need to do a bit of work in advance because of course it's not that easy to launch a mission just straight the next day. So we did a few years to figure out how to launch the mission there. It'd be great if we had one ready to go for any of these objects. So sure. What we're currently working on in planetary defense. Um, it's a, it's a big topic at the moment and research and governments are actually interested in this, which is great because we need them to be, to support the research community launch mission.

Speaker 2:          18:11          Basically, the longer you have, the better. If you want to deflect something and it's way off, it's going to be a smaller nudge to deflect it. If you just want to push it out the way, then if it's right next to earth already, you're going to have to deflect a long way for, it's a mess. Ideally, we'd want it to deflect them. We just want to put it on a different course. And this is our planet and we don't care if it hits another planet, but we want to protect our own planet. Um, we could, if we're stuck and we don't have much notice, we could explode it in some way if we can find a way. Of course, he might need to use nuclear weapons, which is not going to be fun if you're going to get the reign of this nuclear weapon falling down on the planet. But

Speaker 1:          18:45          possibly in violation of treaties?

Speaker 2:          18:49          I think if we, yeah, I think so. I think Nico weapons aren't allowed to be used in spaces like in a bad way. So I think everyone was saving our planet then we'd probably let it go and maybe some nuclear fallout wouldn't be as bad as just being hit by an asteroid. So we'd, we might allow it, but you know it, it sounds like science fiction and it is science fiction, but it's also now turning into reality. These are really kind of what we're thinking of. If there's other crazier ideas that we don't have to explain these things, there's other ideas that we can spray paint one side of this object. So generally these objects are very dark and as they go by it, something else, heat it up. Now if you can change one side of the asteroid, if you could spray paint it white or metallic, it's going to heat up differently as it goes near to the sun and it will start spinning differently. And if it spins differently, it'll change is all bit gradually. So these are very gentle techniques. It sounds a bit mad trying to spray paint in space, but this is literally one of one of the things we could do or cover it with something to kind of change. It's how it reacts to the Sun's heat.

Speaker 1:          19:41          I never saw the movie Armageddon, but I, I, I gathered what it's about. Is it yet? I haven't seen it. I gather what it's about is they sent like basically miners to space

Speaker 2:          19:49          Ben AFLAC where you split us up there, right. Oil minus. Yeah. They would drill it,

Speaker 1:          19:54          but so it, it never occurred to me like I, I kind of get that, but it had never occurred to me that maybe what you won't want to sentence taggers that could yellow spray paint the side, right? Yeah, they would, they would put a nice mural on the side. It would look pretty as it passed us by safely. I mean, every hour to work on that. That's your next book. Should do that. I can be the novel. Right? Yeah. Um,

Speaker 2:          20:14          but yeah, I mean, of course we're not actually going to send people up. In reality what's going to happen is that we use robots and in space, of course, all the time we use robots just because they're more expendable. We don't really care if we killed the robots. We care because they cost a lot and a lot of people's careers going into making them something else. The legs really fall, fall in love with it. Yeah. Don't we all, but yeah, it's not human. So there's this big issues of sending humans into space and yeah, if we're going to send them to landing on an asteroid, well asteroids don't have an awful lot of gravity cause they're small objects, so they're going to have to be tethered on, um, uh, can't remember what they did. And I'm forgetting if, if they would, I think it was just roaming about freely.

Speaker 2:          20:49          Um, they would probably a float off into space, you know, so it's not easy to send humans to these objects. I'm sure it will happen in the future way into the future. But for now it will be robots, which again is not easy because as you know, you're trying to run a, a robot from earth and millions of miles away has its issues. Communication Times a tricky cause. It takes a long time to communicate, right? Things go wrong. Like I run a lab instrument for many years and I could be in that tinkering with it and something went wrong. I could change things, but if that instrument is way off on an asteroid, there's nothing you can do. If it breaks, there's not ran off like you can do. So yeah, there's lots of issues.

Speaker 1:          21:24          So, but we have actually sent a space missions to these objects to, to comets and asteroids before. And uh, it was, it was, uh, uh, I would say it was, it was pretty evident from reading your book that you're a big fan of both the startups and Rosetta missions.

Speaker 2:          21:37          I am, yeah. They got a chat to me.

Speaker 1:          21:38          Speaking of, speaking of landing something on a, on a, uh, one of those objects, Rosetta actually did that. Yeah. Tell us a little bit about those missions. Yes.

Speaker 2:          21:47          Sorry. I mean, the NASA stardust mission was like, it had happened at head to board at SOM, pulls back as I was starting my career in this and this area of science. Um, so the NASA status was really groundbreaking. It was actually quite a cheap mission and it flew to comment built to, and it wanted to bring a sample back, but it didn't have enough money to land on this subject and come back from it. So they flew through the tail of the comments. So I had mentioned that comments have a lot of ice and dust in them, and as they go by the sun, this material gets heated up. So sure enough, the ice streams off the comment takes dust with it. And that's what the thesis of the tail, when you get the famous comments that you see, all the beautiful images of that tale of material is literally the gas and dust coming off of that comment.

Speaker 2:          22:26          Um, and so what they did was just flew through the tail of this comment and literally just got impacting particles on this collector. And that was their comment samples and they closed up that it'll collector and jettison it back to earth and the rest of space cock carried on. And we had these samples back in 2006. Um, and they will often ask sample it real samples of a comment because it's hard to know if we've got any niche rights of comments because as I said earlier, they probably explode as they enter the atmosphere. So it's hard to know. We've definitely got one on earth. Um, so this was a real groundbreaking mission and then it also really turn the books on what, how we thought comments formed and what it showed us was that actually this, we know it's a comment, it behaves like a comment.

Speaker 2:          23:03          We know it's all bad that it comes from um, you know, from the Kuiper belt. And then what we find is that actually it doesn't look like a comment when we look at the rocks within it, right? They look like an asteroid. So it doesn't sound very exciting to be like, hold on a minute. This thing formed way out in the outer solar system yet. It's got components within it that look exactly like the planets that look exactly like the building blocks of the planets that form very close to the sun. So how do we get ice and hot material contained within one object? So this was why everything got blown apart at this stage. And the scientists, you know, and they're still working on it. We're still trying to understand how we get hot material from the inner solar system out to the comet forming region, um, to form a comment that then is covered in ice and dust and all the normal stuff of the we it to contain. Um, and, and there's lots of different theories, but that is still an ongoing area that we need to understand. So we know that the story is not as simple as it could be as we'd like it to be, as, as the textbooks would have us believe

Speaker 1:          23:59          before we move on to said it, start us to also brought us back in addition to bring us back. The first sample from a comment brought us back samples of interstellar protocols, right? It did. Yeah. The detector around the other way. And exactly what a few of those as well.

Speaker 2:          24:09          Yeah. Basically we have particles from interstellar space, which is the space around all the stars and the solar system. Um, and these particles are traveling sexually fast. Um, and they, we haven't really been up to sample them before, but so this, um, kind of, it was called like a tennis racket style collector. We kind of just came up out of the spacecraft once I collect a comment particles and then the backside collected interstellar particles and they're tiny. They're like the best so tiny that we can't like the Colette particles or small, I'm saying like probably a maximum of like the width of a human hair would be the largest particles we collected if that. Um, the interstellar particles are 10 times smaller than that. So they're very hard to see on the collector and they're very hard to analyze. But like there wasn't a whole instrument built, um, somewhere in la or somewhere in California. Can't remember which, uh, university, it's that, but they basically made a whole instruments to measure these, these, these particles because we can sample then our galaxy because we have no other way. We haven't been able to go out to our galaxy, but these particles come to us so we can actually start to understand what our galaxy looks like and what it's made of, which is fascinating. So yeah, it was, you know, just did so much that mission. It was fascinating.

Speaker 1:          25:15          There were, there were some other really interesting things in there. You, you go into it a lot of detail about exactly how the, the, we're able to get some of those, those samples out and so on. But um, we might want to come back to that. But I did want to also give you a chance to talk about Rosetta as well. Yeah. Fascinating. Such a great mission.

Speaker 2:          25:31          So I was just really well placed on the sound. We're really lucky to be where I was working when there was that commission. Little is ongoing now. I have to say I wasn't in it from the beginning cause it took 20 years to plan this mission. In fact, I think when it was originally implant, I was probably still in school. Um, like you know, primary kind of school very early. Um, and then it took a long time to build the mission and then, um, it took 10 years for it to actually from launch to get to it's comments. So it had this massive journey in the solar system to get to catch up with this comment. So there's comment, um, call it 67 peach therea mafia, Russell Manco. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          26:04          Can't do that. I just like everybody else. I just say Cherry Jerry. Oh, oh

Speaker 2:          26:07          yeah. You can say CG or does nps a long name. Um, but uh, it was traveling into the inner solar system and the idea was that they launched and had to decent gravitational slingshots of different planets to catch up with it. Again, enough speed cause you can't just launch and go directly to a comment. That's literally not how it works. So we have to just catch up with it. So it got onto an orbit eventually is catch up with the comment, came up on it from behind and then an incident orbit around this thing that we've never done this before. So you know, start that just flew through the tail. Um, but [inaudible] was just amazing. It got to the comment and it, it basically had to do a powered, it couldn't get into orbit around it cause the subject small, it wasn't a real obit, but she's with gravity, how it fly around it.

Speaker 2:          26:45          So these people doing this engineering and all the science for this mission and it just, I just am amazed by how they did this, but they didn't even know what this object look like before we got there. We had no idea of its shape or its exact size. We were expecting it to be sort of round because we always kind of envisage these objects to be sort of round. Um, and we got there and it turned out to be like a rubber ducky. Anything that says like it caught everyone's attention in the media quite a lot because it literally has, it looks like a rubber duck. It's got this head and this body. Um, and I can't imagine how you figure out how to fly around that thing without bumping into it or whatever. But we started to get images back from this comment and they mapped 100% of the surface of the comment cause they had to pick somewhere to put a lambda down. Right. Um, again, they, they built this landed 20 years previous and they didn't know what they were going to be landing on. Um, do you call it candy philosophy or the stuff you eat at the fair?

Speaker 2:          27:39          Kansy okay. So we call it candy floss. So one of the scientists likened it to like, they didn't know if they were getting my landing on Candy floss or cotton candy or cement. You know, they were like, they had no idea for this concrete hard or very soft and they were going to sink in. So they had to build a lamb dish after you just have to build a spacecraft that's going to land on something that you don't know what it is. You have no idea what it is. Exactly. It's, it's easy. Um, so, you know, they launch, they let the little lambs ago, um, and the lender is called [inaudible] and it just dropped to the comment. But again, remember there's not much gravity. So the comment is not attracting that thing to it. The comments still rotating in space. So they have chosen a landing spot and they're like, yeah, we want to add exactly here.

Speaker 2:          28:15          And sure enough, it did initially land exactly where they wanted it to go on this object. That's like three by five kilometers in size. So it's not big and it all hurtling towards the sun at the same time. Um, unfortunately some stuff went wrong. One of the harpoons that was meant to fire when they landed in order to kind of hold it onto the surface and tether it there, they already knew when they were going through their procedures, before they were going to release, um, Phil, I that it wasn't working. So they already thought, okay, what can we do about this? There's nothing we can do this, you know, we have to just go for it. Now we have to test it. So, you know, they did their job right, they got exactly where they wanted to, but the land of bounced, it bounced about kilometer up into the air.

Speaker 2:          28:54          And other issue is that it could have just completely left the comment because it wasn't going to go back. It didn't bounce quite high enough that it left. So it went back down again. Um, and, and it took a few hours and then it landed again and had another balance. So it's kind of hilarious. It did the kind of three landings and space and they were already planning to do one. Unfortunately where it ended up, um, was not the optimal position for the solar panels. So it was kind of under a slight cliff. But we then learned that comments have cliffs on them and you know, overhanging sections. It's Kinda crazy. Um, and but it did run, it run its primary science sequence when it got initially to the comment. So we actually ended up sampling some of the comic gasses and some of the dust that was, um, from the initial landing site. And then it's in for the science later on. So we still learned an awful lot. So it kind of seems like a failure, but it wasn't a failure all, it's not at all this huge amount of science done. Um, and, and we had, um, when I was working at open university and, and the UK, we had one of the instruments on the lander, so we had a mass spectrometer that can measure some of the components from, from the gasses and there. So we've got to learn what was, what was on the comment.

Speaker 1:          29:57          That's right. And to your surprise, you got, you got that, you got samples from like three places exactly. Work for this guy, Ray Arvidson, great guy who, who would say all the time, there's no bad data. Um, and so you, you know, just because you didn't get the exact day that you plan to get doesn't mean you didn't get some great stuff. We've got the stuff from, you know, because it was bouncing. You got it.

Speaker 2:          30:14          We actually got multiple locations and then we still have the old button that was, you know, still orbiting around or flying around the comment at the time. Um, and doing its own work. It was measuring lots of other experiments and dangles over of the work and measuring dust coming off and collecting that and looking at the, the plasma environment, how the, how the comment reacts to the Sun, which is very important because we didn't, we don't really know how comments react to the someone we know that they get heated up and mixed girl comes off. Um, but we, we found out that actually every time this comment 67 p went by the sun, it loses about a meter of material off its surface. So it gets smaller and smaller because those volatile isis and everything get heated up and blown off the comment. Then that dust that is sitting above it, that's that kind of dehydrated layer on top and it will comes off.

Speaker 2:          30:57          So you lose a huge amount of material. And so it's a very active environment. A comment is constantly changing and you go, oh yeah, that these old objects. And they, they preserved the very old history of our solar system. But actually if they come by the sun, that changing all the time. And, um, and we see that they have seasons. We notice that the comment had different seasons on it depending on, on where you were on the comment and where it was in relation to the sun. So in that wow moves material around the comic, we see movement of, you know, like active processes like you would see on a planet. It's crazy.

Speaker 1:          31:24          Yeah. That's amazing. I, I hadn't heard that before. That's really cool. Um, uh, so long as we're talking about these space missions, I just want to give a quick shout out to the dawn mission, um, which after 11 years of exploring, uh, the asteroids, Vesta and Ceres is, um, uh, is, is running out of maneuvering fuels kind of middle of next month. And so it's going to say goodbye to us, but, uh, but just a little shout out to, to dawn for a long end and a honorable mission, um, uh, increasing our understanding of the very objects that we're talking about here. Yeah. Um, so, uh, uh, uh, so, uh, uh, uh, you were talking about, uh, the, the, we, we talked about this earlier, that there wasn't necessarily a sharp distinction between these asteroids and comets. And so now that we've had these missions to kind of look at asteroids close up and look at comments close out, we're kind of learning more about how like there isn't asteroids and comets, there's more like kind of attractors in, in the space where there's, there's things that we would constantly call asteroids and things we would constantly call comments, but also a lot of things kind of in between.

Speaker 1:          32:24          Yeah. Um, so, so what did we learn from these missions that kind of helps us understand that continuum a little better?

Speaker 2:          32:28          So I think we've, we've learned that for me, I think what I've learned is that almost doesn't matter the, okay, so we have objects that said at either end of this continuum, but if we want to study also the system, it really doesn't matter which ones we studied too much. And the ones in the middle of probably the most fascinating because they contain the primitive materials. So the ones that contain a lot of carbon, um, and a lot of organic matter and the ice is not, you know, is important. But actually understanding the dust that came from this beginning of the solar system is great and the organic matter. And so the next few missions that are going to study these objects are both going to asteroids. So we've got, uh, Cyrus racks, which is a NASA mission and there's a Japanese mission could high booster too.

Speaker 2:          33:06          They did Hibu so one already and that reflected some, some sample and brought that back. Um, and so we've had, it didn't go completely successfully, so they're taking another try. I'm going to do it perfectly this time. But these two missions have arrived at their asteroids and they're both basically primitive asteroids. So they're almost, they're not, they're not comment too, like there's still asteroids, but they have a lot of primitive material in, so we can try and understand these kinds of beginnings of the solar system. So they're both going to be bringing samples back. I've forgotten right now what dates we're talking about, but it's kind of within five years. I think, or something like that. We'll be returning materials. So they've started their mapping phase of these objects and they're going to be looking where they're going to put their lenders down and sampling. But it's proper science fiction stuff. I love it. It's just fascinating that they can do this.

Speaker 1:          33:50          We're going to the solar system and like going to visit comets and asteroids where they live in like bringing stuff back there. Yeah, that's, that's really amazing stuff. Um, so, uh, so we talked a little about, uh, you know, how they're going to kill us all and uh, um, and uh, and what we would do about it. So you talked about kind of like spray painting in a asteroids and things like that. Um, one of the techniques I had not heard about before before reading your book was a gravity tugs, which is another interesting way of diverting asteroids or, or, or comments off their, uh, uh, path. And it's nice because it works with unconsolidated things as well. I want to explain how gravity,

Speaker 2:          34:26          okay, so some of these objects, even the asteroids, like I said, the comments were not very well consolidate and not very well held together because this is a scoop of cloud kind of thing. Um, and some of the asteroids on the other hand, also a unconsolidated, they might be made of rocky material, but imagine just getting like a load of big pebbles and cause kind of sticking together and they sort of held there because it was a bit of gravity and there's nothing really act on them in space that would mean that they wouldn't just all fall apart, but they, so they're sort of loosely bound together. Um, these objects are particularly dangerous because they're hard to move. If you want to hit them with something, they'd probably just going to break up. So we have to be very gentle with them. If we know one of these objects is heading towards us, um, it's hard to know how they're going to behave when they come through the atmosphere.

Speaker 2:          35:08          Um, so the gravity tractor thing is almost just taking a spacecraft up and, and using thrusters on one site to sort of gently nudge and, and basically it's the attraction between that rubble pile and that spacecraft, which isn't very much, but if you've got enough advance warning, you start doing that little playing game and like nudging it back and forth early enough, then it will change it's orbit. So essentially you just kind of want to nudge it very gently and it's just that gravitational attraction between the two objects, which obviously happens even if they're small. Um, there is still something there. So that would be very useful if it were a rubble pile style asteroid. I could work with other ones, but I think that's probably the safest way to move one of those maybe. Yeah. This, yeah.

Speaker 1:          35:51          More research needed, right? Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Um, and, and that's not, that's something we haven't done before. We actually have fired a, uh, a bullet basically deep place one. Right. Fired a bullet into, into the side of a comment. We haven't tried these other techniques at all.

Speaker 2:          36:03          Yeah. Deeds all kind of theoretical. It a mission called deep impact, which don't made a deep impact. And that was confusing my bit, cause my editor was like, you've got a mission called him fat was there's also Hollywood musical director impacts. And I was like, yeah, that's complicated. Um, so I think I ended up taking out all the references, the movie version called Armageddon. Yes. That would be good. Is it? Right. So yeah, this mission actually, um, basically pushed a boulder, I fired a boulder into the side of this comment to see wow. Basically to see what would happen because it's fun. Um, but also to excavate a hole, um, so that we could see inside the comment. Um, it was kind of what I'm a little bit wrong because they created so much dust from this area, you know, impacts that the spacecraft couldn't see anything cause it was just so much dust everywhere.

Speaker 2:          36:47          But like I actually, the stardust mission and when it carried on, when it's had to call it samples and some of those back, the status next mission had carried on. Um, and it, it was managed to image, um, that whole in that crater that was created. So we got to see processes happening and again, they saw changes happening over time in that crater they created. So you see, we've got this kind of active comic thing again, um, which is, which is really cool. So yes, it's kind of one space mission did it. And then we came back and had another look, so. Right, right.

Speaker 1:          37:12          Um, so, uh, we're just about 40 minutes here and probably about time to start kind of mixing it, some audience questions. Um, while we're kind of finding the first victim and giving them the mic. Um, one of the, one of the major, another major topic in your book was about mining asteroids and comets. Um, uh, so that the, so they actually contain material that would be useful to us on earth. Um, it's not just organics but, but also Nicole and uh, uh, platinum and things like that. Um, you want to talk a little bit about kind of mining techniques and kind of what the state of the art there is. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          37:42          So, of course, again, it sounds like science fiction, it's like, do we really need to mine in space? But you know, those companies, a lot of them, you know, a lot of stuff going on in California where we want to, you know, that's how she companies investing in this. Trying to think, right? Can we go my niece objects, we could mind the moon. There's lots of um, materials on the moon that would be useful. Um, but equally it might be easier to mine asteroids, they can be easier to get to. Um, they don't have gravity, so easy to get back from if we want to launch her image it back and they contain a lot of precious metals. So we all love our smartphones and everything. Computers, obviously we're in Google, so we like, um, all these materials that require precious metals. And if we're going to continue creating new technologies in the future, we need to know we've got a reliable source of things like palladium, platinum, all these things that are used in and, um, technology.

Speaker 2:          38:28          We weren't be able to develop new technologies if we don't know. We've got a continued source of this stuff and on earth things like platinum. While that's expensive, because not much of it, we find it very hard to mine. It's very dispersed throughout the crust of the earth and it's expensive to mine and often not very good for the environment to get out. If we go to an asteroid, well there's tons of it actually, there's probably more platinum and some single asteroids that we've ever mined on the whole of the planet, so we run into economical issues. If we were to mine it and bring it back to Earth where we'd crash the market and obviously then it will probably be not worth having done the whole mining thing. Maybe we store it like we did with diamonds and we really sit gradually and control the market anyway.

Speaker 2:          39:03          I'm not an economist, but there are issues to doing that. It may cost trillions of dollars, literally trillions of dollars to actually launch the admissions and go and mine these objects. But the chances you could actually, you know, there could be worth way more than that. Um, so there is, I guess if you have a lot of money and you think it would be fun to go mine asteroids, there is the potential you could make a lot of money. Um, of course we need reusable rockets because it's just too expensive other ways we need to so that obviously a lot of companies are working on that right now. Being able to cheapen, getting stuff into space cause it's just massively expensive. But if we can find ways around this and I think progress is definitely being made at the moment. Um, we can get to space cheaply and we can start to mine new subjects, but we don't have to bring all that stuff back to worth.

Speaker 2:          39:46          It could be useful in space. And we want to go to Mars, we want to venture out further into our solar system. But we need, first of all, fuel. It's very expensive to bring fuel from Earth. If we want to go out into the solar system, fine, we have enough fuel for a little while, but then if we want to land somewhere and go and visit somewhere else, we need fuel. And if we launch it from Earth, it's just very, very expensive. The more fuel you take, the more fuel you need to take that fuel. And there's an exponential relationship and it just gets crazy. So if we can find the fuel in space and sure enough we have water. If we can split water needs, get it into hydrogen oxygen, we can create rocket fuel in space. So again, it sounds like science fiction, but we can then also use these objects to make materials in space three d print.

Speaker 2:          40:27          What we require, instead of taking a lot of tools from earth, which we currently do, if we go to the international space station or stick everything with us and we have to launch missions just to, you know, resupply it. What we wouldn't need to do that. We could just actually go to three d print. So they're actually tested three d printer on the international space station. And it sounds crazy, but yeah, that is something we could do. We just mind the asteroid, get the materials we need and make the tools we require in to space. So yeah, it's, it's happening. It seems like, I think the first steps in as an asteroid mining are probably going to happen within the next few decades. The very tentative steps of like getting their prospecting recently, seeing what these objects contain and then figuring out what kind of missions we required to maybe tug them into an orbit where they're sort of safe and they're going to sit there quite happily so that we can then launch a mission to, to mind them in some way, whether we need humans.

Speaker 2:          41:16          It's unknown at the moment. Um, this is why people talk about needing a moon base for a lunar base for humans to live and that they could then mine from the moon kind of thing. So it's a lot of unknowns at the moment, but there's definitely progress being made. And there are, you know, there's like the u s has created laws about now about mining in space and who owns the, the materials they've mine. So any US citizen, theoretically if they mind something in space, they can own that stuff, which is kind of crazy. And I don't know what the rest of the world thinks about this at the moment. I think Luxembourg are following very similar laws. I don't know if they've passed them yet, but again, Luxembourg is tiny. I don't know if you've been, but there's not many people that live there. So I'm not sure how many people are in Luxembourg citizens. Um, but yeah, is that fair? I kind of think, well, okay, I'm not year since then. I want to go and mind space, but I wouldn't be allowed at the moment to own the space that I, so yeah, a lot of issues, um, and a lot of global

Speaker 1:          42:08          issues. I think that we need to simply, they're worth working out because there's so much, there's so much potential, so much wealth there. Uh, and, and it's not just, you know, wealth in terms of making you rich, but wealth in terms of, as you said, things like resources to make smartphones and stuff like that that play it. You know, I'd never, I'd never really thought about this before, but uh, asteroids like have all these resources that we need and whole lot of fuel that we can use to help further explore the solar system. Asteroids are basically the convenience stores.

Speaker 2:          42:31          Thanks. Yeah, I kind of said like that the gas station's right. Yeah, yeah, right. Kinda pop there and get what you need and then carry on. Of course it's not as simple but right. Yeah, I kind of liked that idea that it might happen in the future.

Speaker 1:          42:43          Okay. So I think we have an audience question. Where did it ready to go?

Speaker 3:          42:45          Yeah, I was going to ask about asteroid mining. Oh, okay. Okay, good. I've ruined your question. I'm sorry Brian. I actually have a question. Have you ever seen the movie Melancholia? No, I never heard of it. Check it out. Basically the premise of that movie is that a large planet sized bodies is heading towards earth. Um, about the size of Jupiter. It's huge. Oh my goodness. Huge, ginormous. The thing is that the scientific community, uh, sees it well in advance, like several years. They're planning it and they're, they're releasing all this information. I don't want to give away too much of the movie, but the premise is that it basically slingshots around the earth and they think it's going to pass. But the slight tug of gravity from the earth is just enough where it reaches its apex that it turns around and comes straight back out. So my question would be like, um, you're kind of doing the theoretical science around how we would deflect or move something that is smaller than earth. Is there any science or theoretical physics and science going on about how we would move something that could be much, much larger?

Speaker 2:          43:51          Well, I think is almost 0% chance of anything larger than the earth hitting earth because the solar system is settled down now. So like I mean, 4.5 billion years ago, earth was hit by a Mars size body, we think. And that's why she formed the moon. So it collided with the earth and we're not sure what the details of that, whether it was a direct impact or as a kind of a side shot, a bit. It probably almost certainly vaporize the earth. And then from that we formed, we formed our earth again but also our moon. So that's the kind of thing that would happen. You know, it would just be completely obliterated if anything larger than Mazda to hit us. But at this stage the solar system settled and I mean, I think it just couldn't happen, but I mean you'd have to know.

Speaker 1:          44:29          I'm sure it makes for a good movie. All the, have you seen this Mike,

Speaker 2:          44:32          by the way? This is really cool. You just toss it around. I did wonder what it was when it was hot up here.

Speaker 4:          44:35          Yeah. Uh, so I was fascinated to hear about the inner and outer asteroid belt. Um, and it sounds like they're materially different. So, I mean the outer one has a bit more ice would maybe you'd expect is farther from the sun, but uh, other than that or these different populations and so what segregates them?

Speaker 2:          44:55          So it's just probably more like based on density. Um, so the, the inner objects are denser and formed under hotter conditions, so they're more consolidated, their rocky then metally the ones on that outer edge, uh, probably they're probably form what the comment is falling and when knocked into there. So they are a lot less than say, probably have a lot of poor space. So actually when we got to the risotto comment, I'm 67 P we, we weren't able to measure its density. Um, which is really cool because although it's made of rock and it's made of ice, it's actually has a really low density, um, because it's, it's got lots of holes in it, so they're not, because it's not like gaping big holes in the side of it and like cavities, but it's very porous. Every fine scale, but very poorest. Like it's got a lot of gaps in it. So it's just not very well pushed together. Whereas the objects on the inner asteroid belt, a very kind of, no, probably no ball space whatsoever. Um, so that basically controls it. So these as you move on out, you've just probably got a transition gradually from the inner to outer.

Speaker 5:          45:54          Gotcha. Thank you. Okay. In College I did something, uh, where we had, um, we had designed these transmitters to put on near Earth objects. Um, that there was a lot of concern that the smaller objects that were harder to detect, um, could be the thing that does us in instead of the larger objects that are easier to detect. Yeah. Um, and it was just a, is a design class. We didn't actually deploy it, but is there any like movement and trying to do anything to look at near Earth objects. Okay. So

Speaker 2:          46:30          yeah, we are currently tracking, uh, basically all the narrow objects that we can possibly see. Um, the ones that are caught sort of a normal orbits. I say those ones because there could be some random objects that are at the moment far out that are going to become near Earth objects. But we don't know they're coming here because they're very small. But, so those are kind of the unknown. The unknown. Unknown's I guess. Um, but the ones that we can see and we are tracing the orbits of all the time, so we're constantly updating where we think they're going and how that spinning because it's very important to understand how they heat it up. I said earlier about deflect to them. If he paint one side a different color, it will spin differently. Well, there's two effects that happen in space. Your pen, your cops get effects and that and they, that determines how these things spin and how it affects that all bit basically as they heated up by the sun.

Speaker 2:          47:16          So it's, we sort of know most of them are going to hit us, but we need to just define those two phenomena very clearly and then we can know exactly where they're going to go. So some of these objects are on sort of a hazardous less, but we just need to better define where they're going and then they can be removed from that list. But yeah, when we're talking about the size of these things, it's funny because even if it was just a couple of hundred meters across, it could still cause a lot of damage depending on what it was made of. If it's a pure piece of metal, yeah, sure enough it's, it's going to probably get through the atmosphere quite easily and wherever that hits okay. It might not cause global devastation like we saw with the dinosaurs being killed off, but you know, it could cause quite a lot of issues and we've had impacts in the past, which haven't been massive, but they can create things like, yeah, nuclear winters essentially, you can have it as a near like a, when you get a massive volcanic eruption, like it's the same kind of thing.

Speaker 2:          48:04          You can change the climate of the planet for a considerable time. And I would suggest that humans are fairly kind of, um, a vulnerable species. We want clean water, we require movement around the planet quite a lot. And I think if anything like that happened, we could be quite vulnerable species. So, even if it was a smallish impacts, um, it could just cause quite a lot of issues. Obviously the larger impacts, if we're talking kilometer sized bodies are larger, they're going to be a bigger problem. So understanding those kinds of small ones, there's still quite large is really important area, kind of 400 meters across and so is they're pretty dangerous. Um, and they're hard to see. So we need to understand those, especially if they're dog, if they're proper lake, dark carbonaceous asteroids, they're very hard to see because they don't give off much light. So that's what astronomers rely on, these things giving off light and that's why comments are easier to see. They shine. Whereas asteroids can be a bit sneaky. So we have to be careful.

Speaker 6:          48:58          I have a question about the interstellar dust stuff gets collected. Um, it might be outside the scope of this conversation, but I was wondering if it gives us any kind of, um, understanding of the original big bang and maybe supporting the, the theory of the Big Bang. Um, or is it really more like stuff that's 4.6 million years old and it's very localized dust.

Speaker 2:          49:23          So I'm going to have to say, I don't know to what some of the actually, cause I've not kept up with that interstellar stuff very well, but I know that it's basically allow us to look into our local galaxy. Um, and I don't exactly know when that dust was formed. Um, but what they've been able to do is actually measure, like the eyes are tapes of the elements of that material. Um, and that allows us to understand a lot about our local environment, like what our solar system formed from and have a seat. We expect that different galaxies are going to be different compositions, um, because they formed at different times maybe, I mean the were still don't really understand all of that. So because we haven't able to sample it or, you know, look at it very clearly because these things are so far away. So it's kind of understanding a little bit further back in our history, um, what is in there. But yeah, I'd have to say I'm not too sure. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          50:11          So recently there was big news about this, uh, asteroid from outside the solar system that blitzed through. Oh, I'm so glad you mentioned this. I haven't mentioned it yet, so yeah. Yeah. Okay, great. Um, is that something that uh, was a one in a hundred year event or was that a question of

Speaker 2:          50:28          our sensors are getting better and we can expect to see more of them? The more we play the latter. So we think, so I'll just backtrack a little bit. Say this, I'm objects that came through our solar system. We actually think now it was probably a comment, but we're not a hundred percent sure. We weren't able to measure it very well cause we didn't know it was coming, but so it wasn't on the normal or bear that all the other comments and asteroids and planets are on. It just literally came zipping through our solar system. It was so fast that it didn't even get caught into the gravity of our sun. It just zip by and it came from some other star system. We have no idea where. And it's probably been some like interstellar traveler for forever. Who knows? When it formed, it came from very far away.

Speaker 2:          51:05          Um, so it's been going for at least billions of years. Um, and it just zipped through. So we don't know a lot about it. We just know that it's, I think it's called Moo. Is it called Miramar? Like I think it's Hawaiian for Muah. Muah. I think. Um, and I think it's Hawaiian for something like a distant traveler or something like this. Um, I probably pronounced it wrong. I didn't know Hawaiian. Um, but basically we, if we knew one of these was coming, we could launch a mission again to go and sample it because this will be fascinating. We'd learn about that star system that it came from, which could be completely different to what we're seeing here. Probably would be, um, it could be the same, who knows, but we know it came from somewhere else and we just haven't seen one of these before.

Speaker 2:          51:43          I think probably other objects like that have gone through the solar system, but we haven't spotted them. They get very fast. I think it was just chance that it was seen as well. Um, but it is fascinating and I would love to have some sample of that comment. There would be so cool to analyze. But um, yeah, I'm hoping, you know, in the future as we get better at seeing these things coming again, it wasn't very big. It was also really weirdly shaped. It was like a cigar shape and really long and kind of like, you know, maybe it's some alien spaceship, who knows.

Speaker 1:          52:11          Basically you're saying we're being visited by cigars.

Speaker 2:          52:13          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          52:15          it would be so happy. Um, uh, so, uh, we just have a couple minutes left and I, I wanted to ask you, um, if a European space agency or NASA or somebody came to you and said, hey, we'd like you to be the principal investigator, that is the top science person for the next space mission, it's going to go and maybe explore one of these objects. What would you want it to be? What would you do it? What would you do with that mission?

Speaker 2:          52:34          Oh, I wouldn't be able to cheese. I mean, so at the moment we've got these missions, Osiris Rex, I'll give you two, just one. So I, I would want to go and explore the cope about better get samples of it. I'd want to explore more of the comments but equally some of them really exciting scientific things happening right now and sell it to us and you've opened up, this isn't comets and asteroids but this is potentially finding a life in our solar system. Um, these are moons of Jupiter and Saturn and they have liquid oceans beneath an icy crust and there's a really high potential that they could have life. Probably not intelligent life, but there could be life then for me at the moment. I'm just fascinated by that and I, we are going to one it again to your right per, so hopefully my wife was working in Europe only.

Speaker 2:          53:15          Okay. So that's going to be seen and we will hopefully go there. The Europa Clipper mission, um, Enceladus, unfortunately we found the Ansel or just had this liquidation as after they'd already planned the sessions she wrote. But, but it might actually be a better place to look for life. It might, it doesn't have quite the same horrible radiation environment that you ripped pat. So I fuck on shoes and actually cotton choose Pluto is also fascinating. It would, we've flown by it. We've learned a lot by just flying by it, but it's an, it's a copa object. It's basically a large comment and um, but there's probably other really fascinating objects in the Kuiper belt that we need to look at. So we just haven't explored it enough. We need and it's just too far away. So yeah, I need to kind of speed up, time, time travel and then come back and get some samples. But yeah, I didn't know.

Speaker 1:          54:00          It's, it's wonderful to have so many good choices. Yeah, that's true. Um, doctor Starkey thi this has been a terrific conversation. Thank you so much. Um, keep having the book. Absolutely. Our pleasure. Uh, the book is catching stardust, comets, asteroids in the birth of the solar system and all this stuff we talked about and so much more as in it. I encourage you to read it. Um, please join me in thanking our guest today, Dr Natalie's.
