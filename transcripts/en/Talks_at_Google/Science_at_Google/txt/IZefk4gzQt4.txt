Speaker 1:          00:00:05       Please put your hands together for Daniel Dennett

Speaker 1:          00:00:14       can, can I ask how slice to be put up a, I'm not an actor. I'm a professor. I liked it. I liked to see the students' eyes. I like to see the audience reactions. I feel very uncomfortable if I can't do that. Okay. So my new book is called from bacteria to Bach and back. And let's see, oh yeah, turn it on. All his helps. That's a bacterium and that's buck. And I'm going to say a little bit about them, but mainly today I'm going to talk about back cause that's what you folks come in. Yes, Google actually is uh, not just mentioned in the book but uh, discussed a little bit in the last chapter. So we'll get to that. But first I have to give a sort of swift review of how I got there. So here's the great tree of life. This is my favorite diagram.

Speaker 1:          00:01:13       I just realized there's all these screens. I can't use my, my laser pointer. So I have to use the, um, cursor here. Aha. Here we are. So if you, this is the present out here at the outer edge and this is the origin of life here. So time goes this way. Everything that's alive on the planet today, there's somewhere out there on that fringe and you can see how it started with the archaea and the bacteria. And then you had this amazing event. This was the, you carry Arctic Revolution, the endosymbiosis, the creative that you carry. Odic sell the first great technology transfer to independent simple cells, bumped into each other and instead of one eating the other, they joined forces and it just happened to work. And thus was the eukaryotic cell born and everything that's alive that's big enough to see with the naked eye is a, you carry out where are you carry outs.

Speaker 1:          00:02:17       So were pine trees and whales and birds and everything else. Everything else except for bacteria and some other protests. So this huge colorful fan out all the sequel to chance event that happened, uh, several billion years ago. And then here is another familiar feature. You may have heard of the Cambrian explosion over a relatively short period of time, a few million years, relatively short by evolutionary biology, biology standards. You had a tremendous creative burst of new designs, novelty, and of course along with the creativity when a lot of destruction, mass extinctions along with the, it wasn't a tremendous arms race. I'll have more to say about that later. And so then over way over here somewhere we have the mammals and let's just a look a little bit larger at the mammals and let's look at even a little bit larger. And if we look, see that little y there right there, that's about 6 million years each leg. So that could be the chimps and Bonobos on one leg, enough on the other. That's how recent hominids are us and and modern homosapiens of course, it's much more recent still. So there we are, just that just a tiny little twig on the tree of life. So there's the tree of life.

Speaker 1:          00:03:55       And I like that particular diagram because it helps us to visualize the history of life on the planet as a history of r and d of a research and development. Um, it's a design process that exploits information in the environment to create, maintain, and improve the design of things. I do not shrink from talking about design by evolution. I think it's a mistake of evolutionary biologist say we're not going to talk about design because that gives aid and comfort to the ID intelligent design crowd. No, the, the, the brilliant designs of evolution, if that isn't designed nothing is because it outstrips human design often by, by many degrees. Uh, let's agree. It's designed without an intelligent designer. That's Darwin's idea. I have more to say about that. Well, R and d takes time and energy as you know. And there were two main varieties. There's evolution by natural selection and then there's human intelligent design, low lower case. I lower case d.

Speaker 1:          00:05:17       Ours are intelligence designers. The rum is full of them. You were intelligent designers and you're not alone. And there had been intelligent designers for quite a while, but not for millions of views there. I've only been intelligent designers for a hundred thousand years, which is just barely visible on the map of the tree of life. We're a very, very, very recent development and if we read back features of our own intelligent design into nature at our peril, there are very important lessons to learn about that effort to reverse engineer nature. And I, I indulge in it throughout the book, but there are things you have to be careful about because the process is different. Fundamental ways. Evolution of course is purposeless. Foresight lists extremely costly, trillions and trillions and quadrillions of poor organisms die childless.

Speaker 2:          00:06:24       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:06:24       Oh, 99% of everything that's ever lived, died, childless, an awful lot of waste. And of course it's slow. It takes billions of years. Contrast that with intelligent design, which is purposeful goal directed. It's somewhat four sided. Why does foresighted is it often thinks it is and of course it's governed by cost considerations as you all know. Well,

Speaker 2:          00:06:56       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:06:56       And it's usually relatively fast. Even though, as you also know, particularly in the world of software, projects always take longer than you expect, even when you expect them to take longer than you expect. So evolution may be slow and costly, but it is brilliant.

Speaker 1:          00:07:24       Uh, the late great Sir Francis Crick once made a joke about it, a teasing in a way his colleague Leslie or goal by calling it [inaudible] second rule evolution. That's clever. And you are, and what he meant is not he, nobody on earth would ever be less likely to be a supporter of ID, intelligent design. Then Francis Crick, that was not his point. His point is that the process of natural selection though mindless, purposeless without imagination. Nevertheless, it produces designs that are more cunning, more devious, and more efficient than most human beings can imagine. That's what he meant. So intelligent design now exists, as I say, the room is this where we are sitting in a, in a veritable castle of intelligent design and it's becoming ever more intelligent. And a lot of you can take some credit for that too. And this has some surprising implications.

Speaker 2:          00:08:38       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:08:39       Here's an interesting comparison.

Speaker 2:          00:08:41       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:08:43       On the left, you see an Australian termite castle on the right you see Goudis, famous Barcelona church Sagrada Familia. They're remarkably similar in overall shape and structure and material. And even the interior design. There are many features and com it says sort of breathtakingly interesting comparison. So the end product is dry. They're strikingly similar. But the processes by which these products have been made are hugely different. These are my exemplars of a point. I want a contrast. I want to stress the termite castle is made by termites, millions of them. And in a word they're clueless. They don't know what they're doing, they don't know why they're doing it. There's no boss termites, there's no architect, termites, there's no, uh, subcontractors and contractors. They all just doing their little local mindless jobs. And amazingly the termite castle with many outstanding design features like air conditioning, uh, emerges from, they're very competent but clueless behavior Goudy.

Speaker 1:          00:10:08       On the other hand, it was just perfect for my purposes cause he's the archetypal charismatic, mad genius Eero, the top down king of design who had blueprints and manifestos and proof of concept and and it was all planned out in advance and he lord it over his assistance who Lord it over their assistance, who lorded over their assistance, who lorded it over the brick layers and stone cutters and others who built. So we have Goudy as an exemplar of cop down design and the termites as an exemplar of bottom up design. I think that's pretty clear. Now here's a puzzle. We have bottom up design and we have top down design. I'm just giving you some examples. Now a termite colony might be as many as say 70 million clueless termites, a brain latest count, 86 billion, even more clueless neurons. Your brain is much more like a termite colony. The new might like to think there's no boss, there's no boss Neuron, there's no head architect, there's no lieutenants and captains and generals. Just 86 billion, a little mindless neurons and doing their thing and having even less knowhow and versatility in many ways. Then then the termites.

Speaker 2:          00:11:50       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:11:51       so now here's the question. How do you get a gouty type mind out of a termite colony? Brands? I think it's obvious to everybody that a termite colony, wonderful though they are. They're never going to write any poems. They're not going to have a new form of government. They're not going to build ships. They're not going to do any of a kazillion things that we've done, and yet the whole column me, how's it structure, which is not all that different from the structure of our brains. The neurons are semi autonomous, quite independent. They live their own little lives and they grow up around in their local spaces, not unlike termites. So there's the puzzle. Now, what's the answer? Well, the short answer, which is nicely been put by a former student of mine, bulldog album, you can't do much carpentry with your bare hands and you can't do much thinking with your bare brain. You're bear brand is like a termite colony. It can't too much thinking. It's very competent at some things, but it can't do much thinking and it can't because it doesn't have the thinking tools. A termite colony is a bear brain. Intelligent designers have well equipped brains equipped with thinking tools. Where did they get their tools?

Speaker 1:          00:13:21       Well, the wrong answer, this from Freeman Dyson technology is a gift of God after the gift of life. It is perhaps the greatest of God's gifts. Who is the mother of civilizations of Arts and sciences? The Freeman is a sweet man. The passengers I'm quoting, the first sentence is false and the rest of that, I think that's true. So we have to replace that first sentence with something more plausible, something more naturalistic. So if that's the wrong answer, here's the long answer. Cultural Evolution, cultural evolution, the process of natural selection of cultural items, design thinking tools that imposing novel structures on our brains. What happened over not billions of years, but only over thousands of years. It was cultural evolution is very fast, is that virtual machines we're evolved that could travel and spread and be installed on different brains giving those brands powers they otherwise didn't have. Or as I like to put it, there are apps that we download into our neck tops and I mean that almost literally our basic mammalian brains or like a computer without even an operating system or with only a rudimentary operating system. And then we pile in the apps and many apps depending on other apps, which depending on other apps, and in the end you have a multi competent

Speaker 1:          00:15:20       entity that can do things that the bear brain can't do by itself.

Speaker 3:          00:15:27       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:15:28       And that's the power, the source of our power and versatility. Well that's the long answer, but very shortly put, I want to know spell it out in a little more detail because I want to highlight a few of the important features of this idea, which many people find shocking and repugnant. And I want to acknowledge that and expose it so we can move on from that. So we have to go back to my favorite passage from a critic of Darwin's who talked about Darwin. Strange inversion of reasoning. I read this over the years. Many times. I still love to read it because it expresses the outrage so perfectly. And I'm going to attempt to do it in a sort of Oxbridge accent accent because the author who was originally a anonymous, uh, in the book in which he said this, he's listed, uh, in the, uh, on the title page is simply a graduate of Cambridge University. So here is what you've said in the theory with which we'd have to do absolute ignorance, AI absolute ignorance is the art Visser so that we may not see it as the fundamental principle of the whole system, that in order to make a perfect and beautiful machine, it is not requisite to know how to make it.

Speaker 1:          00:16:58       The caps are in, the original proposition will be filed on Koval examination to express and condensed form, you know, central poor port of the theory and to express in a few words all Mr Darwin's meaning who by a strange inversion of reasoning seems like absolute ignorance, fully qualified to take the place of absolute wisdom in all the two points of creatives skill. Exactly. He's nailed it. That's what Darwin did. And it was a strange inversion of reasoning. Why do we send our children to university? So did they get the wisdom so that they can then do achievements of creative skill? Here's Darwin saying it's the other way around. Now we can, we can get brilliant design out of absolute ignorance. Well, the idea was appealing to many people, but it really needed another great Brit too. Oh, show in detail how this might work. And that's my second hero, Alan Turing. And here's Turing strange and version of reasoning. First of all, remember, here's Darwin's strange version in order to make it perfect and beautiful machine that's not requisite for know how to make it. Here's touring's in order to be a perfect and beautiful computing machine, it is not requisite to know what arithmetic is.

Speaker 1:          00:18:38       What Turing had figured out was that the computers of his day, who were people, many of them wearing dresses, women who would read mathematics in university, that their jobs could be replaced by a machine from which all the comprehension we're sort of laundered out. And that was the dawn of the computer age. So Darwin and touring together have a common theme, which, uh, is expressed in my, I suppose this is my bumper sticker. Now these days, competence without comprehension, competence without comprehension. The upshot of this is very alarming to many people. That means that mind consciousness, understanding, intentionality, it's the effects, not the cause. The traditional view with God, the intelligent designer providing all the meaning and purpose and it sort of trickling down to the creations. Throw that away. It's not a mind first universe. It's a matter first universe. Mine is a very recent development on this planet.

Speaker 1:          00:20:02       Termites are not intelligent designers. Beavers are not very intelligent designers. We are the first intelligent designers and the tree of life. And we come along very recently, but what a difference we've made. I want to talk about the McCready explosion. I mentioned the Cambrian explosion. I want to talk about an even more dramatic explosion, which I call the McCreaty explosion. Paul MacCready, how many of you know who he is? He's a late great green engineer. The gossamer Albatross, the pedal power of the human powered plane that flew across the English Channel. That's one of Paul is brilliant creations, uh, of a real visionary man, a wonderful stuff. And he wrote a paper not so many years ago where he calculated that 10,000 years ago, a twinkling in evolutionary time, the human population plus their livestock. This is as agriculture was just getting going 10,000 years ago. If you took the human population at the time plus all their livestock and pets, it was probably in the order of a 10th of a percent by weight of the terrestrial vertebrate biomass of the animals. We're leaving out all the insects in the worms and the fish in the sea, terrestrial vertebrate biomass a fraction of 1% 10,000 years ago. The percent today is rather hire. Would anybody hazard a guess?

Speaker 1:          00:21:47       95% no, that's low. It's 98.

Speaker 2:          00:21:52       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:21:54       we have in golf the planet, most of that is cattle. But this is probably the biggest, fastest biological change on the planet ever. And this happened in 10,000 years. And genes don't explain it.

Speaker 1:          00:22:20       Technology explains it. And Technology is not transmitted through the genes did, it was in fact the result of another great technology transfer. I already described the eukaryotic revolution where to to produce cells to prokaryotic cells, each with a billion year lineage of r and d to give them the talents that they had joined forces. And suddenly you had this multitalented new things that you carry odic cell that was a fee can happy event if ever there was one. The next one is the invasion of human brains by symbiotic thinking tools means a term of course is from Richard Dawkins the selfish, I don't know if you've read the selfish gene, how have you haven't, we'll put it on your list. It is. It is one of the great science books of the 20th century. And uh, uh, it is often denigrated and dissed by people who's scared of it. It is still to this day was published in [inaudible] 76 probably the single best, clearest and most exciting a survey of what we know about evolution but it's been written.

Speaker 1:          00:23:51       And in that book, the selfish gene, he also wrote about a new kind of replicator, which you call it a meme, a selfish meme, which are like jeans are like viruses, they are cultural replicators and like viruses. A virus travels like it doesn't carry its own replication machinery with it. It has to invade a cell and commandeer the copy machine in that cell to make copies of it rather than the, the, the uh, DNA that the cell was supposed to copy. And he suggested that culture was composed of entities that were similarly capable of provoking their own replication by invading brains we don't inherit means via our genes. We learn them from our parents, from our peers, from our friends, from television. We are constantly bombarded with ideas. Some of them stick, some of them go in one ear out. The other, the ones that stick take up residence in our brain and then they have to compete for life support with all the others that are trying to get in there.

Speaker 1:          00:25:15       And every time you think it, you make an offspring. Every time you say a word, you make another copy. Every time you think a word, you make another copy and words of the best examples of mutes. I'll get to that. I'm getting a little bit of edit myself. The main point though for our purposes here is that we don't have to design them ourselves. We are the beneficiaries of thousands of years of cultural evolution. We don't, we don't have to design alphabetizing lists are long division or, or, uh, plain geometry or calculus or, uh, uh, how to write music or the, uh, uh, well tempered scale or a perspective or I could go on forever. Of course, these are all highly developed ways of doing things

Speaker 2:          00:26:21       that

Speaker 1:          00:26:22       or not instincts, instincts are ways of doing things that are passed through the germline, through the, through the DNA. Memes are just like instincts, their ways of doing things, but they're not passed through the germline. They are, they are picked up perceptually, uh, socially. Many in most cases, we don't have to design them ourselves. In fact, nobody has to design them.

Speaker 3:          00:26:52       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:26:53       So the McCready explosion isn't an explosive amplification of competence, which eventually it started off being competence without comprehension. I think it's very important to realize that our early ancestors, the first at the first hominids infected with memes were still pretty clueless. They didn't know what they were doing. They didn't think of it as cultural. They didn't think of it as anything. They just had all these new habits that were infectious, that got them doing things that they hadn't done before. And it turned out that these built and built and built and built, and pretty soon they had language and then they had epic poetry and then they had, uh, architecture and boat building off to the races. We go and be evolved into competence with comprehension. So finally we get to comprehension the dark. So it's the Darwinian strange inversion reinvented. We get a move, a trend away from bottom up competence without comprehension to the evolution of a different kind of designing, which is competence with comprehension. To understand this, we have to understand free floating rationales.

Speaker 1:          00:28:13       Trees do things. I know some people don't like that term. I'm sort of sorry I coined it when I did, but it's sticking and, and I can't go back and change it now and in a way it's sort of evocative because what I mean by a free floating rationale is a reason, a real objective reason why something is the way it is. That was never anybody's reason until some clever person analyze the thing and figure it out retrospectively what it was good for trees to do, things for reasons that trees don't know them, that they aren't reasons that the trees have and consider, but they do lots of things for reasons fun. G Do things for reason. Bacteria do things for reasons. The biotic world is saturated with reasons from the molecular scale on it. There are reasons why the parts inside the bacterium have the shapes they do and have the powers they do and fit together the way they do.

Speaker 1:          00:29:10       And we can reverse engineer these. Don't think that those reasons were the reasons represented in the head of any intelligent designer ever. They just were uncovered and exploited by natural selection. And now we clever reasoners that we are can sometimes go back and reverse engineer them and uncover the reasons that then become represented for the very first time. When we write about it, talk about it, argue about whether this is the reason for that is a reason, something is the way it is. And we do things for a reason. We shiver, we vomit, we blink and we don't have to know why we do it, but there are reasons and there are good reasons. And then there's the things that we do where we choose and decide and we act for reasons. Sometimes we do that without even appreciating that we're doing that

Speaker 1:          00:30:05       retrospectively, we may figure out, oh, it was a good reason for that. And of course sometimes we confabulating sometimes on purpose. How many of you have ever made a move in a chess game, which only later you realized it was a brilliant move. And did you admit it? I, there was a very good reason for them. I didn't think about it at the time, but it slowly dawned on me that phenomenon I am arguing is much, much more frequent than we think because we tend to uh, advertise all of our successes with retrospective accounts of the reasoning that led up to them. And it may be in some sense be accurate. We're actually reverse engineering how we got there. But that doesn't mean we thought of it at the time. It doesn't mean we had the reasons in mind cause you don't need a mind to act for reasons. That's one of the lessons. So the problem that culture solves is it is the question, how do you get a buck tight mine out of a termite colony brain? How do we get intelligent design with representation of reasons out of 86 billion mindless neurons?

Speaker 3:          00:31:27       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:31:27       And that was the second great endosymbiotic revolution,

Speaker 3:          00:31:31       Huh?

Speaker 1:          00:31:32       We are apes with infected brains. Our brains have been colonized by all of these viral like things. A virus has an alive, but it evolves. Some people think viruses are alive. You can argue about that, but viroids at least. All right, what are they? A virus is a string of nuclear cas who'd with attitude. It just happens to have a shape that gives it the competence to provoke its own replication. Uh, under many circumstances. Meme similarly are things made out of information with attitude. They provoke their own replication

Speaker 1:          00:32:21       and they don't have to understand this. This is just the secret of their success. We're now ready to look at cultural evolution and, uh, nobody in this room I think will be intimidated by such a simple diagram, but I find that for many audiences have to sort of lead them through this. This is one of Peter Godfrey Smith's Darwinian spaces. Uh, uh, we can't easily imagine four dimensions or more. So w we, well if we want to imagine changes in evolution, not only in things evolving but in the very process of evolution itself, we can take various features of the evolutionary phenomena and map them on three dimensions in a, in a three space and then put things on the, on the, on the Cuban various places. So in this case we're going to put a down at zero zero zero. We're going to put very Darwinian evolution. That is to say this is um, uh, no competent, no comprehension at all. Mindless trial and error, a random search, uh, bottom up. So if you like it sort of Termite Castle type R and d. Okay. Up in the upper right hand corner, your far right hand corner. I put intelligent design, which is high and comprehension involves top down methods and involve directed search,

Speaker 1:          00:34:03       purposefully directed search. So now the question is how do we get from the lower left hand corner to the upper right hand corner in a hundred thousand years? And what I want to argue is that evolution itself evolved as cultural evolution got under way the products of cultural evolution change the very terms of of selection so that the process of evolution was sped up and sped up and made more efficient. The searches became less blind and trial and error. The organization of the searches became more top down, who comprehension level gradually goes up and we ended up not at the pinnacle but close to it.

Speaker 3:          00:35:03       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:35:05       I put Picasso, I put the termite castle down in the lower left and I'm putting Picasso up in the upper right hand corner. Not because he was the most intelligent designer ever will because he said he was. He once said, [inaudible] the truth, I don't search, I find I just get it without any grubby trial and error. No way ratios, no false starts. I just leap with my God like genius to the Mount Everest peak in the fitness landscape and Bingo, I created another masterpiece. Well, [inaudible] partial truth. My answer is married,

Speaker 2:          00:36:03       not true.

Speaker 1:          00:36:05       It's an ideal of creative intelligence that even Picasso could not meet. And in fact, if you look at his work, you see that he made, sometimes it doesn't, sometimes even hundreds of variations on a drawing or a painting. Uh, uh, before he stopped working on that, his part of his genius layer and the fact that unlike a lot of other artists, he signed those and sold them. Imagine if you could do that with software.

Speaker 2:          00:36:35       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:36:36       So I'm going to replace Picasso with Barak, who really is an exemplary in was an exemplary intelligent designer. Deep comprehension of what he was doing. It was highly constrained trial and error methods. He was a very fast composer, cantata a week for years. Amazing. And it was constrained by knowledge, by comprehension, by foresight. He really knew what he was doing and he had purpose and foresight. He was magnificently equipped with thinking tools. He couldn't have existed before the, the system for writing music out and instruments like the Oregon. And in fact, he wasn't just an organist. He was more famous in his day as an organist and as a composer. He was in Oregon repair man. He understood Oregon's from an engineering perspective. So he really does make an exemplary intelligent designer. He had music theory, he had the history of music, vast knowledge, this, these are the thinking tools he used. Now we're ready to look at a comparison.

Speaker 2:          00:37:57       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:37:59       I thank Matt Ridley for this slide. Wonderful writer about evolution. On the left you see an national and hand axe. They were made by our ancestors for about a million years without any change. It's one of the strangest artifacts ever. A million years without any change

Speaker 2:          00:38:20       on the right you'd see a mouse,

Speaker 1:          00:38:25       nobody invented the Ashmolean hand axe. Douglas Engelbart invented the mouse. The was invented

Speaker 2:          00:38:36       when back in the 70s maybe late sixties so almost extinct. It may soon be extinct.

Speaker 1:          00:38:47       That's the difference in speed of cultural evolution measured on the big scale of the tree of life. So here's our diagram again. First thing I want to acknowledge us that we're not the only species that has some cultural evolution. Chimpanzees have a several traditions of, of not cracking and have a termite fishing or aunt fishing that are passed on non genetically. And there's different traditions in different, in different troops. And that's where it stops. It never goes cumulative. It never goes recursive had never piles up there. They're not a one trick pony, but there are about a three trick pony. But now I want to talk about our cultural evolution and all the things that are made of information. These are some of the most important things in our lives. You are very familiar. You are living in this world of things made of information. They have to have a physical embodiment. This is dualism. But what matters in every case, there's something that you can send from a to B in a bit string if you want to. You can't send a bowl of soup

Speaker 2:          00:40:07       that way.

Speaker 1:          00:40:11       So now let's look at the key elements of cultural influence, uh, cultural evolution in our species. And I think words are the key elements. And I want to suggest that the first words that existed were what we might call sin anthropic words. Now ascending, sending thropic species is a species which is not domesticated, but has evolved by natural selection to thrive and human company. Mice, rats, squirrels, barn swallows, bedbugs, cockroaches, and many, many more. Those are sending thropic species. The first words were like that. Nobody owned them. Nobody. People didn't even hardly notice that they were using them. They use, we're just habits that they developed. I go into this from a lot more detail in the book. Next we get domesticated words and as Darwin tells us that the key feature of domestication is you control the reproduction of

Speaker 2:          00:41:23       yeah, animal. So

Speaker 1:          00:41:27       do you have a vocabulary? Those are your words. You have your vocabulary, 50 60 70 80,000 words, and if you ever catch yourself about to say one word and then replacing it with another word, reframing what you say before you blurt it out. Most are domesticated words. You're controlling their replication, not perfectly, but you're playing a strong role in which words get replicated when, and a lot of this is beneath notice, but nevertheless, this leads to differential replication. And the words are not all was wonderful. I like to tell my students that there are, um, it's quite possible for there to be a, a word or an expression which is of no utility, whatever, but which catches on and which has because it has its own fitness. It doesn't have to boost your fitness. It just has to be able to survive. And one day a student said, uh, can you give me an example? I said, well, it's like if you are, I'm like talking about some subject like, and uh, like it occurs to you that like maybe there would be a word in the sentence that like he didn't have to use all.

Speaker 1:          00:42:58       And he said, I get the point. I want an example.

Speaker 1:          00:43:07       It's very important that memes can evolve without human notice. Even though they involve the utilization of human perception, the pronunciation of a trim or the meaning of a term, who gradually shift over your lifetime or over a couple of generations or over a few years. And suddenly you may notice, oh my gosh, this used to mean something else. Now it means something different. Happens all the time. That's mimetic evolution after domesticated words. We get coined words. The word meme is a good example, deliberately coined sort of like GM food, intelligently designed terms, you can design them all day, but whether they catch on depends whether they replicate is that's the hard part. So even though they are given a boost by human intelligence, they still have to survive by differential replication in the society. Most coined words don't. Then we get to technical terms, which are very deliberately created, designed and, and their reproduction is fostered by careful training and and examination and sort of group pressure.

Speaker 1:          00:44:31       You to get everybody on the same page here. Now phenotype genotype, if you don't understand that you fail a class. So we, those are sort of hyper domesticated words where we're very, we expand a lot of energy and time to make sure they replicate and that they record replicate accurately. And then we get to internet means, and a lot of people would say the Internet means or sort of a reductio ad absurdum of Dawkins' concept of memes. And I used to think that myself about, I think that's too bad. This wonderful term is being hijacked and used in this dumb way. And then I realized, and the reason I thought it was too bad because an intelligently designed meme is a contradiction in terms. You might think it's supposed to be an evolutionarily designed, bottom up designed cultural item. But my gosh, they have contests to see who can design the most viral Internet meme. That's manifestly, these are, this is an attempted intelligent design. But is this a reductio ad? Absurdum no. Is this a contradiction in terms? Well, in a way, yes. But so what a splittable ass who Adam is also a contradiction in terms, but nobody goes around saying there's no such thing as an atom.

Speaker 1:          00:46:02       So what we have to recognize, and one of the main points of my book is to show that darkens concept of memes does just fine as long as we allow for the fact that the evolutionary process that enables cultural evolution changes, that evolution itself evolves into a process, which is evermore like what tradition tells us cultural evolution is namely intelligently designed treasures that are understood, bequeath to the young, uh, et Cetera, et cetera. So that traditional views of culture are sort of limiting cases of cultural evolution. And in between we have every combination and degree of 70 insightful tinkering. One of my favorite examples is the Polynesian canoe. I'm not going. Uh, and this is where I got the quote that I'm going to read, but it turns out that the philosopher who who was writing it was not writing about Polynesian canoes, but about French fishing boats. Every boat is copied from another boat. Let's reason was follows in the manner of Darwin, it's clear that a very badly made boat will end up on the bottom after one or two voyages and us never be copied. One could say then with complete rigor that it is to see herself who fashions the boats, choosing those which function and destroying the others. That's natural selection. If comes back, copy it.

Speaker 1:          00:47:32       If it floats, copy it and notice it. This, that's the tradition that you're working under. You don't have to know why it's a good boat. You might be all wrong about why it's a good boat if you're just conservative. I don't know why they do it this way, but grandpa did it this way. I'm going to do it this way. And by and large, if it ain't broke, don't fix it. And gradually the design will stabilize and uneven, improve all without any comprehension required. In fact, comprehension can stand in the way. You can have a brilliant idea, which turns out to be just wrong. Mother Nature punishes you for that. So in this diagram, the traditional model of culture as well, and the upper upper reaches up near the ceiling. It's the economic model of culture where we think of culture as treasures, you know, high culture, opera, museums, technology science, the declaration of independence, all that wonderful stuff which we appreciate, preserve honor, make sure that our children and grandchildren, uh, take control of them and appreciate the value of, of keeping them alive and sober. The preservation of our culture. And that's a very real phenomenon. But what we have to realize is that that's the icing on the cake. In addition to all the treasures of culture. There's all the trash of culture, all the junk, all the graffiti, all this stuff that's just fad and fancy aid comes along for the ride.

Speaker 3:          00:49:09       Okay?

Speaker 1:          00:49:09       Because it can,

Speaker 1:          00:49:12       that's it. It has its own fitness independently of what we think of it. Some of it we'd love to eradicate and if only we could, but we can't. So now we're living in the age of intelligent design and cultural evolution is to become every more top down, evermore comprehending and self comprehending, evermore refined in its search methods. And of course the same thing has been true genetic evolution because we now have GM food and we have Craig vendor, et Cetera, et Cetera, et cetera. So we seem to be entering a new, wonderful world with Google leading the way. But I want to suggest that what we're doing is we're entering the age of post intelligent design.

Speaker 3:          00:49:55       Okay?

Speaker 1:          00:49:55       Why? Because in many fields, intelligent designers are exploiting the truth of Oracle. Second rule that evolution is cleverer than you are. Genetic Algorithms, deep learning, evolutionary architecture, nanotechnology, uh, breeding nanotechnology by making a novel proteins in a, in a evolutionary setting, machine learning.

Speaker 3:          00:50:24       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:50:25       These are technologies which wonderful epistomological competences without comprehension.

Speaker 3:          00:50:35       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:50:36       Watson Beats Ken Jennings in jeopardy. Google translate, lovely example of competence without comprehension and many, many others. And in fact, in science itself, we're now getting black box science where you got a box designed by some wonderful technocrats. You'd put the data in, you push the button, you get an answer, which you can prove is highly reliable, better than you could do using the old fashioned methods. Do you understand how it does it? No. Do you have to know? So we're moving away from the ideal of comprehension

Speaker 3:          00:51:21       that

Speaker 1:          00:51:22       created intelligent design in the first place. One little bit. And then I'll close on this. Uh, Noam Chomsky is famous for distinguishing between what do he cause problems versus mysteries. I'm 90 call some puzzles, problems we can solve like evolution and quantum mechanics and plate tectonics and meteorology and the big bang. And then there's mysteries which are beyond human. Ken Now and forever.

Speaker 1:          00:51:58       I find that, uh, I really dislike that idea because it's so defeatist. Basically says, give up. Don't even try. But he's inspired some people, some philosophers in particular to become what has become known as Mysterians who make a point. I, I think they should wear bags over their head for saying things like this. Make a point of declaring. We will never understand it. Well, speak for yourself. The rest of us are going to go on and try it if you don't mind. So I used to have a very, very dim view of this whole approach and I still do, but Tom's, he's recently changed his tune. I want to draw your attention to this. In 2014 he said the following things, you know, I think this was on the podcast, while there's a conceptual distinction between problems and Mr EDC says, we accept the best explanation as science can give us, even when we can't imagine how they work. It doesn't matter what we can conceive anymore. We've given up on that. Well, there's comprehension matter. Do we want post comprehension science?

Speaker 3:          00:53:15       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:53:15       do we want to technological competence without comprehension.

Speaker 1:          00:53:21       Darpa has gotten into the act with a new initiative for so explainable AI, which seems to be directed precisely this issue. It's going to make ais that can explain their results to us. Poor adults who are using the systems. Is that a good idea? I think it depends on how it's done. Should we try to make persons out of these explaining ais? I think no. On the pro pro side it seems, well that's great. They can explain their reasoning to us so then they can develop their own imaginative curiosity and epistemic goals. We sure we want to do that. I think we shouldn't because it's going to blur the lines of moral responsibility

Speaker 1:          00:54:09       because they don't have skin in the game and we want the people who make the decisions that really matter to take moral responsibility for them. And we can do this with some legal innovations. We could license users of these new, the epistemological black boxes and they would have to prove that they understood the limitations and the boundaries of any system that they used. And as it were made money using, they would be morally responsible for any misuse of anything that came out of the box that they use. And they would not be able to declare whether who didn't understand, because you'd have a strict liability law was it doesn't matter whether you understand you want to use this tool you have to take as it were, the risk of being held liable for something if it goes wrong. That's a bracing test, but it's a good one. It keeps people

Speaker 1:          00:55:14       very honest, keeps, gives them a real sense of due diligence and keeps them from just taking the manufacturer's word for it and running off into the sunset. Makers should have the responsibility and we have the incentive to advertise all the flaws, gaps and weaknesses of their systems. Advertising even you might even have, I think it would be a good thing, have sort of tutorial programs built into them. You can't use this system until you can spot the flaws. Now this is going to take you 10 or 20 hours depending on how clever you are to really get to understand what's real and what's facade in this system. I think that would be a very good idea. Many years ago we at Tufts, my colleague Jordan Smith and I created the software studio, the curricular software studio, and the idea was to use computers to, to enhance human imagination.

Speaker 1:          00:56:14       We called them imagination prostheses and what one of our metaphors was, there's two kinds of empowerment. There's the bulldozer and the Nautilus machine way, the bulldozer where you can move a mountain, but you're still a 98 pound weakling. The Nautilus machine is a technology that which actually enhances your strength, your personal strength. And we want to do the same thing for imagination. We want to make imagination enhancers, systems that help people become better thinkers independently of the system they're using. I think we want to make AI's that are nautilus machines for the mind, not bulldozers, tools, not colleagues. Thank you for your attention.

Speaker 2:          00:57:03       [inaudible] there's microphones. Anybody that has up questions should step up to the microphone.

Speaker 4:          00:57:16       All right, your friends for coming. Thank you. I'm very interested to read your book and I was just going through the index and I see you mentioned, um, Kaufman and Deacon Terrence Deacon Deacon a few times and I was wondering, trying to get the scaffolding right in my mind when you refer to Deakin and, uh, the book, can you kind of put that in perspective against what you're saying that there's purposelessness in the lower forms of life because it Kinda more my reading of him would be the, I can incomplete nature like heirs to Tilian final cause starts to emerge spontaneously. It rather lower levels of order.

Speaker 1:          00:57:55       Well, in fact, I think Terry and I agree, uh, although we'll put it in slightly different ways. Um, Louisa, I did a long and really favorable review of, of, of deacons book. It's on my website. Um, and uh, deacon changed my mind about something that I think is really important and that's what I discuss in this book.

Speaker 2:          00:58:22       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:58:22       He argues that brilliant though touring and Newell Newell, Simon Mccarthy, Minsky and, uh, Shannon, let's say, are the brilliant as the simplifications that they created, which made the computer age possible. There's an important regard in which they've let us into the wrong set of architectures because all the architectures that are made possible by their simplifications involve a separation of energy and information. You don't have to worry. A computer doesn't have to worry about words, where it's going to get, it's, it's, it's voltage from it's computers, parasitic

Speaker 2:          00:59:22       on us. And he says, life isn't like that. The thing that is most important about say, a brain who is that those individual neurons are semi autonomous. And you have to remember they are, the way I put it in the book, there are the direct descendants of free floating you carry out that fended for themselves in a difficult ocean environment for millions of years before they ever became parts of multicellular organisms. What are they doing in there? They're trying to stay alive. This is deacons point. You make me an architecture of basic parts which are trying to stay alive. What you're looking for work that's going to be a really different computer architecture room. Anything that we see coming out of the sort of fun, Wyman tradition, even programs which have some of the flavor. Um, well

Speaker 1:          01:00:30       production systems and, and uh, many architectures of good old fashioned AI had this nice sort of competitive feelings, but they, they're not, it's not fundamental enough. So I think, I think Deakin's book hard as it is a very good read for the reasons that I described in the book. Uh, but I don't think that he says, and if he does, this will be a point of disagreement with him that teleology in any sort of very strong sense comes in. Well, I agree that it comes in with the, with the, with the origin of life. I've got a whole section of what happened before bacteria. That's to me one of my favorite sections in the book, talking about how life could ever get started. And what I argued there is the teleology comes in gradually as we move, as I put it from how come to what? For two different why questions I to teach my students this. I have a pair of examples.

Speaker 2:          01:01:40       MMM.

Speaker 1:          01:01:41       Why are planets spiritual? Why are ball bearings spherical? There's a reason. There's a what for, for the ball bearings, whatnot. For the planets. Why aren't asteroids spherical? Why aren't dice satirical? It was a how come for the asteroids and what for, for the dice. What Darwin's brilliant permitted was to how we move from a universe of planet where there's only, how come there's no teleology to a world in which there's what, four where things have purposes and functions and that is itself a gradual process.

Speaker 3:          01:02:36       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:02:37       And I think he agrees with that.

Speaker 3:          01:02:41       Oh, um,

Speaker 5:          01:02:43       hi. Uh, I'm a, I'm a fan of yours. I'm also a fan of David Chalmers and I, I sort of have a question for you. Maybe you've kind of answered this already. Um, which like I, I'm curious as to like when, uh, when something sort of becomes like a moral agent, we're like, when you're not an agent but rather like a patient, like when,

Speaker 1:          01:03:08       when does something, when does it have interests that matter? Well, that do

Speaker 5:          01:03:15       well, right. So, but I wonder though that like if I'm a moral patient and I have like a nerve which causes pain and I'm trying to avoid that, uh, how's that different from like a computer that I'm programming, which has like a cable on which, you know, a signal is transmitted, which might be the pain signal of some sort of mind that we don't comprehend yet.

Speaker 1:          01:03:43       Well, you know, um, we addressed that very issue. Um, in Rod Brooks lab when we were building cog, what, 15 years ago, the humanoid robot, um, and Carl had these motors that stuck out of its elbows and they were a little bit fragile and we didn't want cognitive be able to move at times so that it would, uh, uh, damaged them. So we sort of gave it a, I gave her the funny bone so that if it ever did anything bumped, it's these murders, it sent an effect of pain signal. It was an awesome, do that again. So yeah, we can have a functional, this was of course a top down designed the system to give Kog the humanoid robot, a quiz. I equate I pain system because it had some of the functions of a paint system. And if we'd continued with that and expanded it by many orders of magnitude, the project made some wonderful progress, but you know, not 1% of what you'd have to do. Um, then eventually we would have had a robot that would have interests and where it would be wrong to thwart, thwart those interests. It would be capable of something like suffering. But we never got that far.

Speaker 3:          01:05:25       Okay. Thanks.

Speaker 1:          01:05:26       But I don't think there's, you mentioned traumas. I don't think there's a sort of extra Zoe ingredient quality or something which the living things have and the things made of silicon don't have, I think that's, uh, just a bad idea. Well, I,

Speaker 5:          01:05:45       I think Tom, I'm not saying Chalmers is right, but I think he would go towards the direction of, even silicon has that like your pen psychos him or something like that.

Speaker 1:          01:05:54       But next, next, yeah. Panpsychism is the view that everything is everything. Everything is conscious.

Speaker 3:          01:06:03       And I think,

Speaker 1:          01:06:05       I almost agree with it, but I, I just got to change the view a little bit. I call my view Pan Nifty Islam, everything is nifty. Have we, Adam is nifty. Every electrons nifty. Now the question is, is there any difference between Panpsychism Pan, nifty Islam? They both explained the same things, namely nothing.

Speaker 3:          01:06:27       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:06:30       If you can tell me how panpsychism is an improvement over Penn nifty ism, I'd be very interested to learn. Well, it's because conscious things are made out of conscious things. Oh really? That's it. Colored things aren't made out of colored things.

Speaker 3:          01:06:52       No.

Speaker 5:          01:06:55       Yeah. Thanks for coming. Uh, honored that. Sure. A year. I'm also a big fan. Uh, you mentioned skin in the game and uh, the idea of building into, into, I dunno, into economics or into legal systems, uh, the incentives for makers and users of tools to, to have, to deal with the implications of the tools of using those tools. But I was wondering, and I guess that's more a question of politics or economics, how realistic that is. I am thinking particularly of, uh, of, uh, I don't know, fake news, alternative facts. The use of media and social media to, to spread viral means intentionally to, to provoke a human action. To one direction or the other. And uh, that is, I, I feel that that is its own incentive. The possibility of doing that is so powerful that it's very hard at this stage to build limitations to do that for simple things like, like Internet means misuse, Internet meme, slat alone, uh, uh, AI tools or whatever like that. So, well,

Speaker 1:          01:08:03       I hear you. I think this is, I think we underestimate how serious these problems are. I don't share your pessimism, but I agree it's almost too late and we ought to be thinking a lot harder and a lot faster and we ought to be acting more to try to fend off the trends that we can see happening. I think that really it is the response and boy, if there's any audience in the world, I want to spread this message to a Psu folks think very hard about what the unintended consequences of some of the innovations are and whether there are ways of steering them down more socially benign directions. I think there are, and I think the time is short, but I think we should get cracking on it now.

Speaker 5:          01:09:01       Okay. So there's, uh, just to follow up shortly on that, uh, it's there, there's a, there's such a thing as a personal interest in such a thing as group interest in such a thing as like [inaudible] interests, however defined society. So is there's a bit of, uh, uh, is there a bit of a conflict there and how so you say we should do this, but of course for all of these situations there's this personal interest by a certain group. So I, I, I, you're doing your part by spreading the right meme site, I think. And, uh,

Speaker 1:          01:09:38       well thank you. Um, uh, I'm certainly trying. Um, I think that actually one of the, one of the most heartening changes that I see on the, uh, in the recent development is that now that silicon valley is reducing all these, um, young plutocrats young billionaires and a lot of them are really taking seriously the idea of putting, putting that vast economic power they have to socially benign, uh, projects and they're taking seriously good intentions aren't enough. They've got to figure out what you can really mess things up by squandering a fortune with good intentions on a bad idea. And I think that this ideal of having, taking it as a personal responsibility to use this incredible economic power for good and the fact you, you help each other do it better. This is one of the best developments I've seen and we're not quite at the point where we can start seriously shaming those who don't treat their wealth that way. And I don't think we're going to have to, it shaming doesn't usually work anyway, but if we can make them feel like they're sort of second class, then this would be a stepped forward. Thank you.

Speaker 1:          01:11:21       Yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:11:21       Hi. I want to ask you about, uh, I guess language and kind of the, the limits there of it and try to get a little bit at a tension that I think came up in your talk. So this is a little bit about, uh, the Chomsky criticism that you give and a little bit about sort of the, the tension between Anglo American analytic philosophy and the European continental tradition. So it sounds like on the one hand, um, your, your um, your challenging Chomsky and saying that, uh, that you know, reason in language kind of has a mapping to the real world that we can explain and that there's, there isn't, there isn't really a limit to language, right? These mysteries don't exist. They're not beyond human thought. They're not beyond perception or methods of expressing them. But then at the end of your talk when you started talking about, uh, the dangers, at least what I perceive as you've mentioned and the dangers of AI about competence without comprehension, it sounds to me like the, the fear there actually is very much that it's encroaching on the head Germany of language, right?

Speaker 5:          01:12:20       That we, what we don't want to happen is to have meaning or something extra, you know, act like outside of the scope of meaning. Um, that that kind of messes up our whole calculus, right? Morality stops making sense. Epistemology stops making sense. Ontology like the, that these concepts and things that we say are so had demonic and really do have this very concrete mapping to physical things starts to go away. And so I'm curious, you know, kind of sounds like you're saying both things that on the one hand there's a danger to like meaning escaping us. And then on the other hand, we actually have had Germany over this.

Speaker 1:          01:12:54       That's good. I hadn't thought of tying it to the different between no continental and the Anglo phone analytic philosophy, uh, aside from thinking that with a few exceptions, the anglophone philosophers are not postmodernists and don't, and it's still have a proper respect for truth facts. And I think that the damage done by postmodernist to the very ideal of objectivity and truth is that's vandalism. And one thing I said, which I maybe didn't stress enough at this time, let's look at science. Do you have competition out who can make the cheapest, fastest gene sequencer? And it's getting really cheap and fast and you just push the buttons and it's like, it's like a TV. You just, you know, put it in the microwave and push the button and out it comes. Uh, it's amazing how much of that process, which, which took genius.

Speaker 2:          01:14:25       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:14:26       Which took brilliant drudgery by, by Nobel laureate scientist to do within my adult lifetime. And now you just push a button and you get it. Uh, but look at, so there's competition among different makers of gene sequencing machinery and w w what's the benchmark? Why do you buy unit a rather than unity? Cause you know, well maybe cause it's cheaper, but not if it's not as accurate.

Speaker 2:          01:15:01       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:15:01       Truth really matters. It's, it is a, it is a design in the same way that,

Speaker 2:          01:15:11       hmm. Uh,

Speaker 1:          01:15:14       fuel efficiency or safety or design requirements for cars. So getting it right is taken for granted as a, as a requirement for the scientific black boxes or, you know, getting it right with a high, a high degree of reliability of the probability now.

Speaker 2:          01:15:37       Mm.

Speaker 1:          01:15:38       I can't yet. I don't know of any black boxes

Speaker 2:          01:15:47       that are

Speaker 1:          01:15:49       trying to avoid that and are just trying to make memes. It'll spread truth be damned, a utility be down. But maybe there are, in which case that's a very ominous

Speaker 2:          01:16:07       development. Well,

Speaker 1:          01:16:13       on that apolitical, no thank you.

Speaker 2:          01:16:20       [inaudible].
