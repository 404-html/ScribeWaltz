Speaker 1:          00:13          Well. Hello Google. Thank you so much for having me. It's brilliant to see you all here. I'm only slightly disappointed that there's no dogs in the audience because that would have been completely awesome, but maybe next time we have a burger you can all bring your dogs in. That would be amazing. Um, so yeah, I'm here to talk about my book, bring back the king, the new science of de Extinction, which is all about as kit said, the ability of scientists to bring extinct animals back to life. And it's a science and that's very much in development. It's not quite with us now, but I think it will be with us reasonably. See, uh, and this is, you can see is the book here is my dog Higgs. He's modeling the book, therefore you, just to give you an idea of sample copies, he's called, he's called Higgs, the dog particle, which is a joke that you guys at Google gap, which I can leave you love cause people would normally look at me and stare blankly at that point.

Speaker 1:          01:07          So that is Higgs before he read the book. And that is Higgs. Afterwards, I think he found it quite satisfying, quite exhausting. Uh, so he's my promo dog, which is good. So, um, the book asks, which animal would you like to bring back? And I'm doing an event at new scientists this weekend, and we put out a thing on Twitter just to gauge people's reaction to this. We said, what animals from the past would you like to resurrect? Just to get a feeling of where people were with this topic? And sample answers included the great org. Good example, a smiler dawn, which is a saber tooth cat. Interesting. And somebody said, I'd like a pet velociraptor, please. Which kind of intrigued me. So I tweeted them back and I said, why a pet velociraptor? And the guy said, because I fancy a pet with retractable claws, which is kind of interesting. So I tweeted him back and I said, how about a cat? And he tweeted me back and said, I'm not a cat person.

Speaker 1:          02:18          So there we are. And you'll notice also, I've, uh, anonymized these tweets. Clearly I'm not just followed by people that have Guinea pig avatars. I've just, so there we are, um, uh, other sample answers just quickly before I moved on include can they make a half man half woolly mammoth, which is interesting cause I think I've been living with that particular thing for about the last 10 years. He's called a man off to see what I've done that um, somebody else said, Margaret Thatcher clones, thousands of them, millions, an army slightly disconcerting. That's not what the extinction is about. And then somebody hit the nail on the head almost when they said Dojo. Then I farmed them and start a fast food chain. Dodos Kf d Dodo cottage, which was a good joke, but was topped when somebody else tweeted Nando days. Genius. Absolute genius. Okay. So let me tell you about the extinction.

Speaker 1:          03:23          I want to start by telling you a story and it's a story about a goat, but this wasn't any usual kind of goat. Uh, this was a goat that lived in the Pyrenees thousands of years ago and these were amazing animals. They were big, stocky beasts. They weighed about as much as a washing machine, but they were much more agile. And have these enormous, great big curved horns. And what they used to do is they used to spring around on the mountain sides casting impressive horn silhouettes against the clear blue sky cloudless sky. And they did that brilliantly familiar with thousands of years until we came along at the end of the 19th century. And we looked at them and we looked at their horns and we looked at our empty living room walls, and you'll have to remember this within a time before Ikea. So there was no to go to buy reasonably priced pictures or frames.

Speaker 1:          04:23          So our walls were empty at that point in time. So they looked at it be Kardos horns. They looked at that empty living room walls and they thought, do you know what that would look really good there, which is a shame. So we started hunting them and their numbers plummeted. So then if you fast forward to the year, 1999 there was only one left, one bucardo and that was an elderly adult female called Celia. And scientists knew that her time was running out. They knew they had to do something. So they went up on the mountain side and they caught Celia and they put a radio tracking collar around her neck and then they let her go and they kept an eye on her to see what she was up to. And then the next year, the radio tracking collar let out an ominous beep, beep beep. And it was the signal they had been dreading.

Speaker 1:          05:17          They rushed up the mountain to find her, only to discover that Celia had been crushed by a falling tree. Can have an office, Celia, thank you. So they'd be Cardo was no more, it had three east to be, it was an extinct Bucardo and that was it. And that should be it. That's, that's what happens when animals go extinct. That should be the end of it, except that increasingly that doesn't have to be the case anymore. So actually if you rewind a bit to the point when they put the tracking collar around her neck, they did something else. The scientists, they actually took a couple of biopsy samples from the animal and they carted them away and they froze down herselves in liquid nitrogen. And then a couple of years after she died, they thought these cells and they did the kind of experiment with them that a few years earlier had been used to make Dolly the sheep.

Speaker 1:          06:15          Now are you guys familiar with Dolly the sheep? I'm guessing you are. So here she is. I just want to side track and talk about Dolly for a second. So Dolly the sheep was of course the thirst mammal to be cloned from an adult's out and she showed that you can take the DNA from an adult, so add it into an egg that's had its own DNA removed and then use that to create life. And that was the nominal. So jolly became this huge media sensation. The pepper APTC literally followed her every move. So here she is on the front cover of Nature magazine. Shortly after she was born, then he or she is a few years later on the front cover of Hello magazine. Uh, and then a few years after that, sadly on the cover of Waitrose food illustrated with a little rosemary and garlic, no where she's ended up, she stuffed and she is in a museum in Scotland.

Speaker 1:          07:27          That's our final resting place. God rest her little fleecy soul. So that was the experiment that inspired the Bucardo scientists. Okay. So they did the same kind of experiment and then in 2003 after hundreds and hundreds of attempts, something incredible happened. And this is the actual moment when it happened. So they created a little baby be Comado Celia's identical clone. So this is the moment that de extinction actually first happened. And this was actually over 10 years ago, which most people don't realize. So it was a phenomenal achievement. Phenomenal. And she was beautiful. This little clone, she was gorgeous. She had towels, all the brown stair and wonky legs and toffee colored eyes. But unfortunately she developed breathing problems. And then she died just a couple of minutes after she was born. So they'd be Cardo isn't just the first animal to become extinct. It's also the first animal ever to go extinct twice, which is a bit of a shame.

Speaker 1:          08:38          But I spoke to the scientists who were involved in this particular piece of work and they absolutely assure me that with time and with funding, those are the two limiting factors. They are completely convinced they will be able to bring the Bucardo back, not just one, but many healthy be Kardos that they'd like to see released into their former range. So I don't know how that makes you feel, but that story leaves me with mixed emotions. I feel pretty sad that we treated that Bicharto so badly, but I feel really excited for what might be possible. And I want to show you my favorite photograph of me ever. So this is me on the beach at charm earth as Kipp mentioned, and I'm a little dude on the right hand side in the Austin Red Wellie boots. And I'm about two years old and we used to go down there, fossil hunting and the Rock, there are 198 million years old.

Speaker 1:          09:32          They were formed at a time when there were huge, great big reptilian sea monsters in the sea, pterosaurs in the sky and dinosaurs on the land. And it made me dream about bringing back a dinosaur. So when you think about the extinction, you think about what might be possible. And I began to wonder, could you bring back a dinosaur? And if you did bring back a dinosaur, to my mind, there's only one contender and it's this t rex. It has to be a t rex, right once described as the absolute warlord of the jungle. It's teeth have in the scientific literature, quite humorously been described as lethal bananas. So if ever, there's two words that don't go together. I think it's lethal and banana or possibly Trump and white house, also quite bad. So I was really interested, can you bring a dinosaur back? So I spoke to the scientists and they tell me, it boils down to one rule, magic ingredient, which is this DNA.

Speaker 1:          10:36          And here is some that I knitted earlier. So DNA is a very beautiful molecule, but it's very flimsy. It's very fragile. And after we die, it begins to breakdown. And in exceptional circumstances it can be preserved for a long time. But the oldest thing we have ever extracted DNA from meaningful amounts of DNA from is less than a million years old. So dinosaurs died out 65 million years ago. So no DNA, no dinosaurs, sorry. So we're not going to see a dinosaur. The closest thing we will ever get to a living, breathing dinosaur is this, which is my dog in a dinosaur onesie. Shortly before he called the Irs Pca. So now it's dinosaurs. The other question I get from people is, how about these, how about Joe dies? And I have to see these beautiful illustrations, which are in the book or the work of a guy called Matt Dawson who is fantastic.

Speaker 1:          11:33          And so this is his Dodo. Could you bring a Dodo back? Now they died much more recently. So in theory it might be a bit more possible. However, where they lived in malicious was very hot and the soil where they fell when they died was very acidic. So that DNA is not preserved. So no DNA, no dodos. Sorry about that, but he got this idea going in my head when I was thinking about the book and I thought, so he can't do dinosaurs. You can't do dodos. You need something from much more recent history. How far could you take this technology? Where could you go with it? And I began wondering about this man, Elvis Presley. Amanda deemed so sexy by the TV stations of the fifties that they refuse to show him from the waist down. He was too damn sexy. And I began to wonder, could you, I don't think it's a good idea.

Speaker 1:          12:27          I am not saying that we should do this, but as a thought experiment with the technology we have, could this be possible? And then I came across this website, genuine, genuine website, Americans for cloning. Elvis founded by a guy called Bob Mayer, who I spoke to you for the book, alarmingly banned on Facebook and they have a petition you can sign if you think cloning is a good plenty. Elvis is a good idea. And quite a lot of people have signed it. How serious they are. I don't know. Anyway, the good thing about this website is it gives you a couple of ideas of starting places for Elvis is DNA. Cause if you want to bring back Elvis, you need a source of his DNA. So the first possible source of Dna they recommend is this.

Speaker 1:          13:18          These are toenails. So there's a lady called Joanie Mae and she runs a museum in America and she was going through gracelands shortly after Elvis Presley died and she went through his man cave room is man Dan and had a carpet like this but dark green shag pile carpet. And she kind of got down to her knees at one point and started just feeling around the carpet, maybe a bit odd but hey and I think a snagged on something and she picked it up thinking it was like a way would seek Quinn or something and it was dark. So she popped it in her pocket and when she got outside she discovered it was a toenail. Now toenails are good sources of DNA. They preserve it really, really well. But you guys are probably ahead of me. This isn't an obvious choice for bringing back Elvis because what if it didn't belong to Elvis? What if it belonged to some American Doris wearing open toed sandals? It's an awful lot of trouble to go to. So we scratched that off the list, but they have another source of DNA. And this is Joanie maybes prize possession in her Elvis Museum.

Speaker 1:          14:22          It's the Elvis wart. So in that little test tube, there is a test tube of formaldehyde and it has a wart. Now Elvis Presley used to have a water on the back of his hand and before he went into the military service, the water was removed. And his doctor had the foresight to say that this is in the days before a bay. So it was quite forward thinking. And then it was purchased by the lady from the museum. And I thought, well, maybe we could get DNA from this and we could get DNA from this, but warts are caused by viruses. So this DNA is going to be a mix of human and viral DNA. So we don't want to go that either. So I kind of ground to a halt. And then I thought, well hang on a minute. How about this? How about Elvis Presley's famous iconic quiff, right?

Speaker 1:          15:11          Hey, it's a really, really good source of DNA. What would happen if we did that? And I went onto ebay out of curiosity and I put in the phrase celebrity hair cause I was intrigued to see what would come up. And it's really interesting if you do that. If you put in the phrase celebrity hair, you can buy locks of hair that belonged to all sorts of people, including Abraham Lincoln, Princess Diana and Michael Jackson, presumably from before the Pepsi Commercial. Don't know if you remember that. You can buy hair from Elvis Presley. And I'd just like to read you if you'll humor me, a small excerpt from my book of what happened when I actually bought a sample of Elvis Presley's hair on Ebay.

Speaker 1:          15:56          So this is chapter six, the king of rock and roll. It goes like this. When it finally arrived, I was more than a little disappointed sometime earlier I had bought some of Elvis Presley's hair on Ebay and like a child waiting for Christmas had then had to endure weeks of over excitement and speculation. While I waited for my purchase to turn up, I was expecting something as iconic as the king himself. The package I told myself would at the very least be made of gold army and studied in rhinestones. It would arrive with great ceremony serenaded on by its own backing band, well done by the friends he'd scream of female fans. He would camp outside my house and faint when the parcel arrived, but when the postman finally delivered my precious cargo, it was without fanfare. He didn't even ring the bell. He just popped the plain, that brown envelope through the letterbox and walked away.

Speaker 1:          16:57          I picked up the drab and elvisy anticlimax and turned it over in my hands. Save for the Memphis postmark smudged across the top right hand corner. There was little hint as to the imports, legendary contents, perhaps things would be more promising on the inside. I told myself brimming with nervous energy, all shook up even. Do you see what I've done? I carefully open the envelope and teased out the contents, but the luxuriant quiff of my dreams was nowhere to be seen. Instead, I found myself staring at an a four sized certificate of authenticity. You are now the proud owner of a genuine strand of Elvis Presley's hair. The certificate crowed, but where was the hair? Perhaps they had forgotten to include it or maybe it was being sent. Sent, sent separately and armed guard from Graceland. I scoured the shoddily photocopied piece of paper for a claim and it was only then that I noticed a blob of dried glue at the bottom of the page.

Speaker 1:          17:59          Inside it like an insect trapped in amber was a short strand of hair. I stared at it, unable to believe what my eyes were seeing, incapable of processing what I held in my hands. Words actually failed me. Not only was the strand miniscule smaller even than a single eyelash from my face, it was also, and I can't bring myself to say this, Ginger Elvis Presley. If the certificate was to be believed with strawberry blonde as the penny dropped, I felt so lonesome I could cry. I had spent $14 90 and enjoy the longer wait than the kings fans had for his comeback tour only to receive what appeared to be Ronald Mcdonald's nasal clippings. So we did the only thing I could think of, I seals the certificate back up in its original envelope, found a thick black marker pen and wrote upon it, returned to sender, adding that the address was unknown. The irony I was sure would be lost on them, but it put a smile back on my face. Then bright and early the next morning I sent my letter back.

Speaker 1:          19:18          Oh, one person. Thank you very much. So listen, Elvis Presley, I was so intrigued with this idea. I phoned up a scientist, he works in de extinction and I said to him, can you do extinct Elvis Presley? Tell me. And he thought about it for a while and then he said, yes, people have been cloning pop stars for decades. And I said, you know what? You're right. Obviously, because Simon cow, he produced one direction, didn't he? And the scientists said yes. And that is the reason that human cloning must never be allowed. So it must never be allowed for all sorts of genuine ethical, moral health and safety reasons. And also because it leads to the production of songs like you don't know you're beautiful. So with that I put the Elvis idea to bed. Okay. De Extinction is not about bringing back dinosaurs. It is not about bringing back the king of rock and roll.

Speaker 1:          20:23          That was just my whim, my folly. And then I started exploring de extinction more deeply. And that's what I want to talk to you about now. So there are genuinely about half a dozen de extinction projects that are ongoing around the globe now trying to bring back different endangered species of animals. This is one of them. This is an animal called gastric brooding frog. And what you've got here is a big frog with a little frog in its mouth. Now the big frog isn't eating the little frog, it's actually giving birth to it. So this is a frog that was discovered in 1973 in the babbling Brooks of Queensland, Australia. And what would happen is the female, we'd like her acts and then the mail would come along and fertilize them. Then the female would eat them, she'd swallowed them, they pass into her stomach, which we would, she would convert into a makeshift womb and then the x would hatch, turn into tadpoles, turned into frog legs.

Speaker 1:          21:26          She could have about 20 in her belly at any one time. And when the time was right, she would literally button them up literally. And this is the subject of a de extinction project in Australia under the guidance of a guy called Mike Archer. And the guy who kept these animals in his lab in the 70s before they went extinct, had the foresight to save some body parts in the freezer and they're using those for cloning. So that's one project. This is another project that you're all probably a bit more familiar with. There are the wonderful wooly, mammoth, the iconic species from the last ice age. Now the woolly mammoth is a good candidate for the extinction. Maybe because we have plentiful sources of its DNA, it's quite commonplace to find tusks and teeth and bones in the melting permafrost of Siberia. And sometimes sometimes scientists come across stuff like this.

Speaker 1:          22:22          Okay, so this might not look like much, but this is actually pretty much the entire torso of a woolly mammoth that was found in a remote Siberian island in 2012 and when they looked at it at autopsy, they realize that not only did it have fur and hair, it had skin and flesh and muscle, and when they cut into it, I spoke to one of the scientists who was at the autopsy. It said it looked like it had fresh meat. It looked like it was a fresh beef steak. So well preserved was it? This animal was frozen continuously for the last 40,000 years. And there are three different groups of scientist trying to bring back the wooly mammoth and the first two hoping to use carcasses like this, get cells from them and use the DNA inside those cells for cloning. Right. And that's an amazing thing to try.

Speaker 1:          23:19          However, as an XL biologist myself, I'm slightly skeptical because these mammas had been frozen for a very long time with no kind of protective chemicals to protect the cells like we would do if we were freezing cells in a lab. So the cell shatter the DNA leaks away. It's quite a tall order. But fortunately there is a third group who were trying to bring back the wooly mammoth. And if I have to put my faith in one particular group, it's this group and it's led by a guy called George Church. He works at Harvard. And my faith in George Church is based on two particular reasons. The thirsty is that he is a remarkably intelligent guy. He has a brain the size of the planet, he is so innovative. He has this amazing genetics lab kitted out with all the latest stuff and an army of people working for him who are equally as brilliant.

Speaker 1:          24:15          And the secondary reason is that he has this enormous gray, bushy beard. So he looks a lot like God. So if I'm gonna put my faith in one group, it's going to be the one led by the guy that looks like he would belong on the roof of the Sistine Chapel. And he's not trying to clone a mammoth. He's trying to do something different. So what he's doing is he's getting elephant cells and then he's editing mammoth genes into elephant cells. And he's using this technique of the moment that's everyone's buzzing about called CRISPR cas nine which enables scientists to edit genomes with pinpoint precision. So he's taking the genes that made the mammoth mammoth like in different to elephants genes that control the growth of their, for their big thick rolls of subcutaneous fat. And they're special hemoglobin that's steroid oxygen round at low temperatures and they're putting them in to elephant cells and they're going to use those to create life.

Speaker 1:          25:16          And I wish him well. And a third project is, this is centered around this bird, the passenger pigeon. Now this is a bird that's really well known in America where it used to live before it went extinct. It went extinct at the beginning of the 20th century. But before that for tens of thousands of years, the passenger pigeon existed in fast mind boggling numbers. It was a beautiful athletic bird and a flock could contain billions of birds, I thought could be a hundred miles long and a mile wide. It could take days to pass overhead. And when it did, it blotted out the sun. They were like an avian eclipse and then one day they were gone.

Speaker 1:          25:59          Pardon me? And the scientist he's trying to bring them back is using this same gene editing technology to try and do that and some very clever cell biology. So there's three of the projects that are ongoing. But of course the most important question is this, why? Why are scientists trying to do this? What is the point, right? And that is a really, it's the most important question to ask. And there are lots of reasons why personally I think de extinction might be worth a shot. The first is this, if you think about the animals we've just mentioned, think about the causes of their extinction. The gastric brooding frog went extinct because it's suffered from something called the caterer had fungus. And in fact, in fact, amphibians all around the globe are being affected by this fungus and there's a massive amphibian die off going on and we're spreading that fungus around the globe through the commercial transport and trade in Amphibians.

Speaker 1:          26:57          Humans were implicated in the demise of the woolly mammoth. It may not have been exclusively our fault, but we were implicated and the passenger pigeon, we shot every single last one of them out of the sky. So you could argue that where we've played a role in the downfall of a species and where we have the technology to do something about it, maybe we have a moral obligation. And I think that's an interesting argument. I think it's good, but I don't think it's enough. So when you think about extinctions, people tend to think about things from the distant past. I think about Dodos and dinosaurs, but actually of course extinction is happening all around us today. We live in a time of mass extinction where extinction rates are spiking in the time we've been in this room together and no other species has gone. And extinction rates are a thousand times higher than during prehuman times.

Speaker 1:          27:52          So this is our fault and why it's important is because all living things are part of an ecosystem. And I think of ecosystems as games have giant Jenga. You know the game where you stack the bricks and you have to take them away. What does he take the bricks away? Or you take the species away for a while, everything's kind of fine, but then it gets wobbly and then it crumbles. But because we're in a mass extinction, a period of mass extinction, it's not just like playing a game of giant Jenga. It's like playing a game of giant Jenga with a toddler. It's all going to come crashing down.

Speaker 1:          28:35          So it's important. Think about what we might learn along the way. If we could work out how the gastric brooding frog changed its stomach into a wound, we might be able to work out new therapies for stomach ulcers, people recovering from stomach surgery. And if you go for animals that are unique, genetically unique, like the gastric brooding frog, you don't just put a twig back on the tree of life. You replenished an entire branch. So I think for me de extinction is about restoring lost biodiversity. That's the key. It's about putting animals to extinction is not about making lonely is Eric's habits. It's about making healthy genetically diverse populations of animals that could be returned to the wild where they could interact with their ecosystem in a positive and meaningful way. And that is a tall, tall order. We need to think about what we do very, very carefully.

Speaker 1:          29:36          But in my last five minutes I just like to mention something else. So I have to extinction is about increasing biodiversity there. Maybe it's a form of conservation maybe. And I put a cup of Chamomile tea here cause when I make this point, sometimes I get shouty tweets from conservationists, he'd get very angry with me and they say well the extinction and conservation that completely distinct, you can't lump them together. You can't because conservation is about helping the living and the extinction is about the debt. And I think that is a reasonable point. I don't have a problem with that. But there are two points that I make it that the first is this.

Speaker 1:          30:18          If we can get DNA from museum specimens like this, surprise looking cat, right, or from mammoth teeth or from a pickled Tasmanian Tiger in a jar and we can get DNA from all these things. If we can take DNA from sales that came from endangered species that have been frozen away, if we can get DNA from that and we can use that DNA to create life, then maybe some types of creatures aren't quite as extinct as others. Maybe there are different degrees of extinct tennis. And I think that's a really, really interesting concept. So dinosaurs are well and truly extinct. They're never coming back, but we've suddenly got this blurry spectrum between life and death that didn't exist before. And that fascinates me. And the other point is this, apart from my dog, this is probably my favorite animal on the planet. This is a northern white rhino and there were just three of these animals left three and I live in a wildlife reserve in Kenya and as a grandfather and mother and a daughter, but they are too old to l and two related to breed naturally.

Speaker 1:          31:38          So basically they are functionally extinct. Here are animals that are alive but that are the walking dead that ghosts. So if we do nothing, they're extinct already. So I would argue that attempts to bring back the northern white rhino count as the extinction is a form of conservation and there was a guy who works out of Berlin called Thomas Hildebrandt. He was doing some amazing work trying to save the northern white rhino using some of these new high tech techniques. And I'd like to leave you with one final thought. If we're prepared to think about the extinction, if we're prepared to at least consider in the future that it might be a positive force, I think why stop there? How about if we accept us, we must, that the world is changing, that it's warming, that habitats are changing. How about for example, we use these gene editing techniques that we have to improve the fate of the endangered species on our planet.

Speaker 1:          32:41          What about if when scientists bring back the gastric brooding frog, they add in some genes to make it resistant to the catch with fungus that would kill it if we released it into the wild today. Maybe that's worth thinking about. Maybe we could engineer fish to be able to survive rising temperatures. And this is another very cute animal. This is the black footed ferret. These animals currently all living black footed ferrets today are descended from seven founder members. They're very, very inbred and there the subjects at a massive captive breeding project. But when they're released into the wild, they die because that's a disease out there that's not billing them. Cool sylvatic plague. So plans are afoot to edit genetic diversity back into the black footed ferret and plans are afoot to edit in genes that confer resistance to the disease that is killing it.

Speaker 1:          33:39          And the black footed ferret could possibly become the very first genetically altered wild animal. It's something that the FDA in America, uh, sorry. Not the FDA, the American authorities are considering. So there we are de extinction. I don't want you to go away with a message, but it's about to happen tomorrow. It's not. But the science is moving at a very, very quick pace. And I believe this is possible and de Extinction won't stop with the birth of the first healthy deer extinct animal. That will be the beginning of a long process that we'll see these animals nurtured in captivity for a short while. There'll be able to grow up check to make sure they're healthy, check to see that they can breed naturally. And then, and this is the most difficult parts of all, probably released into the wild under the guidance of the colleges where you would hope they would flourish and interact with the environment in a positive way. So we have at our fingertips these incredible processes, gene editing, stem cell biology, assisted reproduction that cannot only bring back extinct species. They can also sculpt the future of life on our planet. And I'd like to finish with a quote, which I think is particularly relevant at this point. I think it was Spiderman's uncle who wants said with great power comes great responsibility. So I think we need to consider our next move very, very carefully. Thank you very much for listening.

Speaker 2:          35:21          Okay,

Speaker 3:          35:24          so we have some time for questions and I'll take the money. If you could speak into my phone, it would be great. Okay. You say that a human cloning has understandably been outlawed. Um, where

Speaker 4:          35:38          does the boundary lie? Would we be allowed to be a DX stinked neanderthals off, strip it if it gets the amendment and other such Hobo?

Speaker 1:          35:49          That's really interesting actually. So there's a chapter in the book about them that you just mentioned. Uh, that includes me under tiles. And it's very interesting because of course, human cloning, human reproductive cloning is widely band, not in every country, but in most developed countries and rightly so. But actually when those laws were being drawn up and nobody was even thinking about pre humans and they're all currently, as I understand it, no laws forbidding cloning on the Undertale because it's not a homo. Now, I think by extension as we learn more and more about towels, we're learning that these weren't some primitive savages. These were very sophisticated people for their time. They'd been around much longer than us and we're capable of doing some amazing things. They were very, very human for want of a better word. And I don't think cloning a neanderthal is a good idea at all. But what's interesting is that we find the technology in theory is there to make it happen and currently there's no legislation in place to stop it from happening, but no scientist in their right mind is considering it. It's I am pleased to say, and I don't think anybody ever should.

Speaker 4:          37:06          Thanks. Do you think we should have any concerns about a number of hybrid species being produced as a results of gene editing?

Speaker 1:          37:14          Wow, I think that's an interesting question. If we start putting genes in twin day and to the species first, don't, we're not necessarily talking about putting genes from another species. We're not necessarily talking about crossing genes between species. It could be that we find some frogs out there that already immune to cut trade and we might be able to use that genetic sequence. But in fact that was kind of a moot point. This idea of, of using gene editing to kind of enhance wildlife is actually a very logical extinction to something that happens in the natural world and in conservation already. So in the natural world, hybridization does occur between species, not often, but it does certainly within the bird world it's really quite common. There was a study recently where they analyze the DNA of a pile of birds and found suspicious genes that came from other species.

Speaker 1:          38:05          Um, and then the other thing is that conservationists are very conservative so I could name and they tend not to like things that are terribly new. But one conservation practice that has been going on for a long time is that when populations of animals dwindled down to very, very low numbers, what they will do is introduce animals from a separate population to introduce genetic diversity. And sometimes that occurs not necessarily within species, but within the subspecies. So the Florida Panther is kind of a famous example where the Florida panther was seriously depleted in numbers getting desperately. And Brad and then this is a while ago, people imported the Texas Panther and they integrate and things got better as a result. So this might seem kind of new and unfamiliar, but I would argue actually this is something that happens naturally and something that one of the scientist said to me, look, a conservation biologist, he said, look, for years and years people have been solving this problem by moving the animals. I'm suggesting we move the jeans. The end result is probably the same, although maybe if we did it our way, we've got a little bit more control over it.

Speaker 1:          39:19          I have a question. Is anyone looking at bringing back plant life or other fauna or flora rather instead of just foreigner? I didn't particularly look at plants in the book, but um, what we have of course are these amazing seed banks, these repositories of seeds where they're the, they're trying to harvest as many seeds as they can before plants go extinct. And of course if you've got the seeds, it's relatively straight forward. Um, so I don't know about d extincting plant life, but going to the other end of the spectrum where we're thinking about gene editing, of course GM is commonplace in the Arab world now, but the first genetically modified trees, the American chestnut and that had a gene from wheat paste it into the gene of the chestnut tree because it was suffering from a particular type of blight that was completely hammering this type of tree. Um, I'm there now at the stage in the states now where they're considering they've got test plots and they're considering about how they might possibly return the street to the wild.

Speaker 4:          40:17          Do you need DNA from both genders and also be able to bring those pieces back and how many individuals Dna do you need in order to have enough diversity?

Speaker 1:          40:32          Do you need a male and a female? Yes. So, you know, this depends on us having som Paul's in museums of mixed genders. And if we don't, maybe we think about hybridizing say a northern white rhino with its living cousin, the southern White Rhino. So you might not make a pure northern white rhino, but you at least save it's jeans and then over time you can breed a pure animal as time goes on. And in terms of a founding population size, we don't know. Basically, it depends on all sorts of things like the generation time of the animal. So the black footed ferret was presumed extinct in the 1980s they thought it had been wiped out by this place that was killing it and they went out and call every single last animal they could find from the plains in Wyoming, they brought 18 animals into captivity.

Speaker 1:          41:21          This was 1989 and it was seen as this amazing conservation thing. Nobody had ever gone out there and captured all the members of species in the wild and put them in captivity. It was really radical for his. The problem was that from these 18 found a members only seven survived and 9,000 ferrets later through this captive breeding project that they have ongoing that beginning to show signs of inbreeding, but they have cells from some of the original animals that were caught but that for whatever reason didn't manage to breed and they figure that if they manage to create new animals from two of those original animals, they increased the size of the founding population from seven to nine and they think that will give them a decent chance of enough genetic diversity. But it's a question that varies from species to species and genetic diversity is quite a stochastic random process. So it has a lot to do with a random shuffling of the genes. When creatures reproduce, you might be lucky and get away with a very small founding number or in some cases it might take a larger one.

Speaker 5:          42:34          Okay, a nice talk. Thank you very much. Thank you. I have a question. So you're talking about a lot, there's a lot of technology to create a, to recreate animals that are extinct. Do we have debt amount of technology to like predicting pact of this animal in the Eh, in the environment. Because if we bring back the memos and we put him somewhere, whatever, somewhere that would be nice for him. What can we expect from in destroying everything else because there is an imbalance there. Or like the Pgo like if that, cause we have pigeon problem, right? There's lots of pigeon. If we put a new page on there, what can happen? You can, we, we have technology tools to think about it, to understand what might happen with this, this dead end road coming back and just want to think, do you think that if someone finds like is a very big piece of dinosaur, like the fans from the move, maybe they can come back. That would be awesome. Like barn. Okay.

Speaker 1:          43:32          All right. Well, so the first question, um, what day extinction but extinction at the moment. Is it a process in development? It's kind of at the cell biology state and at the create an animal stage. And what's missing, in my opinion, is this kind of long term thinking where we start thinking about what happens when these animals are released. And that's not to say that the thinking's not going on, but that's a discussion that's really just starting now. And we need to cologists brought on in these discussions from a really early point. And not only that, we need Paleo ecologist, so we need people that have studied these animals the first time around. They've looked at their remains, they've learned from what happened when this animal was around the first time around. And certainly with the passenger pigeon, that's something that's happening. The Guy who's leading the passenger pigeon project is a guy called Ben Novak, and he's passionate about the project and he's gone through all the historical records and he has a very, very clear idea of how passenger pigeons, when they were alive, interacted with their environment.

Speaker 1:          44:27          So they were like this swarm of feathered locus. These birds would land and devastate the deciduous woodland where they landed, which doesn't sound great, right? But bear with me. So they would land on my ass, they would topple trees, they would cover the forest floor in Guano. But from that apparent devastation came life. So we're stagnant. Closed canopy woodland turned into one that was sunlit and the Guano fertilize the ground and it paved the way for the growth of, uh, all sorts of different plants, which brought in insects and small mammals and amphibians, which brought in big Grazers, which brought in predators. And he's modeled this whole thing very, very carefully. And he is pretty confident that because the passenger patrion was such a key stone species, it's actions had these repercussions across the entire landscape that if you introduced it back into that environment, it would drive this recycling of the unknown.

Speaker 1:          45:25          The eastern North American forest that has been absent since it's been gone. But that's something we need to think about really carefully. You know, ultimately we don't know. And ultimately we need to build that in to the release of these animals. We also need to think about our get out plan for these animals. You know, the world is, is read riddled with invasive species that are causing their responsible for most of the extinctions that are happening. Certainly on islands there are big, big problem. You don't want anything that you go to all this trouble of creating to be considered a pest. You don't have to kill it again. So these are things that we need to think about really carefully. And I hope that answers the first question. And the second question is with dinosaurs. There's a lady called Mary Schweitzer in America who is, um, she studies dinosaur bones and she seen these really tantalizing glimpses of biological molecules inside dinosaur bones.

Speaker 1:          46:22          So I wouldn't call them proteins, but she sees signs of proteins, she sees signs of sounds and our results are pretty controversial and yet they're beginning to be backed up by some other groups. There was a group at UCL last year who found something similar. People haven't really looked in dinosaur bones for these kinds of biological molecules because we've been taught at school that they are in a, it's a mineral, that they're inorganic. But that dogma is potentially beginning to change now. And she went even further. Cause for her, of course the natural progression is to say could DNA be in there? And she ran some tests on some quite ancient dinosaur bones and sees signs of DNA. So I'm not saying there's DNA there, but she saw a signature of DNA. However, it's one thing for DNA maybe to be there in fossils, which is questionable fossils of that age. It's quite another for it to be in any usable form. And I don't think we will ever get DNA in a usable form from dinosaur bones. You have to be able to reconstruct the genetic sequence, the genome to give you that set of instructions to create life. And would you like a pet dinosaur? Me Too. But sadly we're going to have to fell for dogs and bring them into be back. We're getting dogs to work and dinosaurs that could get messy.

Speaker 6:          47:46          Alright. Thanks a lot for your time. Thank you for thinking of engaging. Uh, I have one question. It seems like the biggest problem is having a source of DNA, again from dangerous features, dishes. Are we doing anything to treat? I sort of bank for the future because if it's not today, it's might be 100 years. This techniques will be finalized on work. So are we thinking about building this instead of relying on single museums than might have one species DNA or something like that? Are we doing something more global?

Speaker 1:          48:13          Yeah, so we've got this massive repository of DNA in museums, but it's much better to have frozen cells because then you've got something that is alive that you can start with. It's far easier to start with DNA inside a living cell than DNA inside a stuffed museum specimen. So the museum specimens are kind of like a, a source of last recourse if you like. What is really important are the viable cells that are frozen and thoughts of liquid nitrogen. And there are multiple initiatives all around the world are doing exactly what you're thinking of. The biggest one is at the San Diego Zoo in America where they have something called the frozen zoo and three of those either but also three, many other zoos and wildlife collections around the world. They send body parts to San Diego Zoo and they culture these cells and they freeze them.

Speaker 1:          49:04          And I heard the guy who leads this is a guy called Oliver Ryder and I heard him speak last year and he says he's always getting interesting things in the post. So partly there was some Orca at seaworld or somewhere that had just given birth and they grabbed the umbilical cord and they packed it into her eyes and they sent it to him when they called yourself from that and they froze them down. So yes, and that's the interesting thing that if we have these frozen cells in liquid nitrogen, you have a species maybe in Stacey's not quite alive, not quite dead. I mean clearly heard his dad, but it's not as dead as some other things. So yes, people are trying to collect as much biodiversity as they possibly can and squirrel it away for a rainy day. And it's not just, they're actually, I should say the main points of these things is not really there for bringing animals, but to lock it.

Speaker 1:          49:51          The main reason for the cells being collected is to use them as a source of learning. They used in research papers all around the world, but by studying DNA from endangered species, you get an idea of the health of these endangered species. You can see if they're going through a genetic bottleneck, it can give you some idea of how to manage your captive breeding programs so the cells that are being frozen away are being used for all sorts of excellent purposes and de extinction is maybe just a glint in the eye somewhere off to the side of that, but it could be used for that in the future.

Speaker 7:          50:30          Hey, we got the same on the same line. It's just a, is it just going to be edited?

Speaker 1:          50:40          It's going to be a muffin or an Lmr. No, you're quite right. It won't be. If Georgia church has his way, he's not easy not calling it a mammoth. He's saying he's making a cold adapted elephant. He's making an elephant, his, his creature. And I should also say none of these creatures that get to extincted if and when that happens, we'll be the same as the original. It's been many, many reasons, many reasons. One of the reasons is their genetic makeup. So George Church is an extreme example where he will end up, if he succeeds in his quest with an animal that is genetically, overwhelmingly elephant with a little sprinkling of mammoth DNA. But he says, well, Hey, I'm completely fine with that. So long as this animal acts like a wooly mammoth and can perform the same ecological role as a woolly mammoth when we put it back.

Speaker 1:          51:26          So in to Siberia. And I don't have a problem with that and that's the way the day extinction community feels. It's not about creating an absolute replica. It's about something that will fulfill a lost ecological niche out. A really quick question about the, uh, the pregnancy or the surrogacy rather, um, say for example, with the, with the Baccato was, how do you select the animal to, to kind of carry the Dakota go to time? Is it something, is it a seminar, mountain goat with you know that she has a lot of the DNA or also for the woolly mammoth, would that potentially be an elephant or how, how does that process, yeah, what you need to do is you need to find the closest living relative. So, you know, I said it's great if you can bring back an animal that is genetically distinct, but of course the, the, the problem there is that if it is genetically distinct and unique, what do you use as a surrogate?

Speaker 1:          52:14          Which is where something like a frog is great because you don't need a surrogate. You know, you could if you don't need a you and you've removed a whole lot of problems. Now with the big Cardo, they used obviously an existing type of goat. They had to create a particular hybrid because they'd be Kardos closest living relative ended up being really flirty and difficult to look after in captivity. And it literally climbed the walls and were so neurotic. I couldn't work with that. So they created a hybrid guy where they bred it's closest living relative with a domestic goat. And found that that worked really well as a surrogate. So I mean, when I, when I give these talks, you only get, you don't get a flavor of the huge amount of research and effort that goes into what happens. So just choosing the right surrogate and getting it to work was massive for the Bucardo team.

Speaker 1:          53:00          And yet with a wooly mammoth, my big problem with a wooly mammoth is that it involves using elephant eggs, which are in really, really short supply and elephants as surrogates. Now, there is one potential way around getting hold of elephant eggs. Scientists are now in this position where they can take skin cells, we program them into stem cells and use them to generate and sperm, right? So that potentially is a very exciting tool we have at our fingertips. It's been demonstrated in mice at the whole process, hasn't been shown, particularly for endangered species, but people are working on that. So maybe we can get hold of a load of elephant eggs, perform these techniques on, but then you still need a surrogate. And I don't feel good about that. You know, elephants are seriously in danger. They're not experimental animals. And George Church, who was amazing, we'll say to you, come on. Think bigger. Think bigger. Think, think artificial womb.

Speaker 2:          53:59          Okay?

Speaker 1:          54:00          Until we get to that point, or until the elephants out of it, you know what? I'm never going to be comfortable with using an elephant as a surrogate. For me, that is a massive stumbling block with a wooly mammoth. And we need to think about the repercussions of every, we can't sacrifice one endangered species to bring back another from the dead. So will all of these questions need to be thought about really deeply with that. Please join me in a massive unopposed
