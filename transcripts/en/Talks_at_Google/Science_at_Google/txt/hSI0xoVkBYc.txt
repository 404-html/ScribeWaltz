Speaker 1:          00:06          Thanks a lot. I got to talk for just a couple of minutes and Alan will talk for a couple of minutes and then we will entertain your questions and, and a have discussion. Uh, it's a thrill for us to, to be here talking to you guys about, um, this, uh, this book chasing New Horizons and the, uh, the mission and the effort that led up to the mission, uh, that finally after a long journey, much of which was spent on earth. Um, we, uh, finally made it to Pluto. Um, and of course Google is a part of this story in, in various ways. In fact, um, one of the really cool things that happened after, uh, the, uh, finally, uh, the, the, uh, success of the, um, of the mission with achieved and, and our new horizons made it to Pluto was that, um, that there was a Google doodle, um, about the new horizons mission are really, really cool.

Speaker 1:          01:05          One of the next day was one of that, you know, part of the global outpouring of, uh, of interest that reflected back on the team that had, that had achieved this. And of course the, um, the conductivity of the world that, that your company has been been so much a part of is also an interesting part of the story because unlike other first planetary flybys historically, um, that happened in the, in the late 20th century, the flyby of Pluto happened in an age where it could instantly be shared and collectively experienced around the world. And it really made the experience different for those of us who happened to be there at the applied physics laboratory in Laurel, Maryland, where the team was, um, controlling the spacecraft in getting the data down. First. It made the experience different there because there was this reaching out to the world and feedback coming back.

Speaker 1:          01:59          And of course it made the experience different for, for people around the world. It was truly the first 21st century, um, uh, experience of exploration that was like that. So, so this book chasing New Horizons, um, is, uh, the story of, um, how Pluto was explored in a lot of, it's really the backstory, the, they, um, the aspects of planetary exploration and have this adventure that's very human adventure that most people don't know. Everybody knows we made it to Pluto. And, and like you said, you know, in a way it's like, you know, spoiler over on the cover of the book, there's a beautiful picture of Pluto. So a lot of this is the drama of will they make it w you know, against all odds. And then of course, you know how the story ends, but it's like, you know, a lot of good historical movies and novels and stories, even though you know how it came out, uh, you can still be on the edge of your seat with the drama and all the close calls.

Speaker 1:          02:59          And that's the kind of story we tell here. Um, I, I've been in love with the story for a long time. Way before there was a new horizons mission. There was a small group, Alan and uh, some of his colleagues who were quite young when they started just out of Grad school and their 20s and 30s, who got this idea that after voyager made it to, to Neptune, which was the last of the sort of previous era of planetary exploration after that in 1989, you know, what was next? We had had our first vibe eyes of all the classically known planets except for Pluto. And these guys said, let's keep going. And at first, uh, you know, they had a lot of doors slammed in their faces and a lot of doubters and naysayers. And then as they started going, there were a lot of, I'm sort of near calamities and a lot of um, seeming dead ends.

Speaker 1:          03:50          But, uh, it's really a story of overcoming obstacles and a team that just got fixated on an idea and didn't give up and eventually gathered more and more people to realize it was a good idea, rallied the scientific community behind it. And there's a whole story there of how the skepticism gave way to widespread endorsement. And then there are a lot of political intrigues and it was canceled by two successive political administrations 26 years from when Alan started working on this to, uh, you know, started, got the idea and started rallying people together to the actual flyby of Pluto. Um, so, you know, you hear like it took nine years to cross a solver system and that is an impressive time and it's longer than, you know, most of our missions and did require a lot of technical innovation to, uh, succeed at that. And yet that's like, you know, only a small part of the long struggle to make this happen.

Speaker 1:          04:46          So, so I was excited to tell that story and excited to work with Allen, um, who you know, who lived it and, and work together to combine our voices and really try to narrate what is essentially an adventure story, sort of a Techie, nerdy, very human adventure story. Um, and um, it's not just Allen want to make sure and point out, uh, you know, he was obviously the leader of the mission, but there were a lot of people involved. As Alan says, it's a team sport. And um, so we included the voices of a lot of other people. Um, uh, members of the science team, engineers, um, some NASA officials at different people that were involved in this history and in this mission. So in the book, in addition to our narrative, you'll see a lot of, um, a lot of Alan's voice in the first person sort of set aside, um, relating his experience, but also a lot of other voices kind of we weaving in and you'll get to know some of the characters.

Speaker 1:          05:41          So, um, anyways, I've, I've loved this story for a long time when, when I got the opportunity to actually work with Alan on this a book, it was a dream come true for me because I, I lived to tell stories of planetary exploration and in my view, there's no better story in our time of exploration. Uh, and then of course, Pluto itself turned out to be just tremendous, uh, scientifically. Aesthetically it's beautiful. It's mysterious. It's so much more active and dynamic than anybody expected. And that has taught us a lot that we didn't know about planetary science. And that feeds back on just our awareness of, of what kinds of planets there can be in the universe in general. So it was a huge payoff. And, um, the, uh, you know, the only person who knows what needed to be known to tell the story really in full is Alan Stern. And it was a privilege for me to get to work with Allen to combine our voices to tell the story. And with that, I want to introduce Alan to come up and, and, uh, say a few words. It's your

Speaker 2:          06:46          [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          06:51          that's great to be here. Um, thank you David. Um, I dunno how many of you know this? David is the best writer in our field as a planetary scientist. No one has written a better books from Venus revealed about the radar missions that uncovered the geology of Venus to Earth in human hands. His most recent work before, before chasing and, uh, and quite a number of others. And it's been a privilege for me. We've known each other a long time in a lot of different modes over the years. Uh, since we met, he lived in boulder for a long time. And then in Denver where I'm based, the used to be my boss too. There's that too. That's true. Um, so, um, this is a really interesting story. I hope you get a chance to read it and I hope people watching on video get a chance to read it.

Speaker 3:          07:43          Um, when I was a boy, I was swept off my feet by the early planetary explorations. All I ever wanted to do was grow up and get through. You know, I'm 11 years old and just the idea of going to college is like the light year in the future and wanted to go to college and then I found out, oh, you have to go to graduate school. Then I went to graduate school for different times. Um, but um, at the time I emerged in 1989 with my phd. Um, voyager was finishing and all the planets from mercury to Neptune had been explored at least first reconnaissance. Pluto was kind of unfinished, unfinished business and scientifically fascinating. We knew that it had an atmosphere and a giant satellite that made it a double planet. We'd never been to anything like that. We knew that it's surface composition was really exotic.

Speaker 3:          08:39          We knew a number of really enticing, very basic facts, but I think you could put them all on a three by five card. Um, but to be a planetary scientist at the beginning of the age of space exploration, the most prized mission is to be on, we're always the first missions. Only the best got to be on the first missions to Mars or Venus or Jupiter or mercury or on down the line. And those are the missions were scientifically, you can say the result is like taking candy from a baby, right? Everything. Every image is, is just big news. Every spectrum, every data type. And for me and for my generation, Pluto is the last train to Clarksville. That's like, that's the only one. When do we get a chance to be on something that momentous and voyager was just finishing and we thought, well of NASA is in the exploration business.

Speaker 3:          09:38          This will be a cinch. This will be a 15 minute conversation. Who wouldn't want to make the first mission to the last planet? Right? And 14 years later we finally achieve funding after crazy experiences, which you'll read about you. This book is really, you know, if you picture like DNA double helix picture like heck to helix or something, because the book is the political story of how this all came to be. And it's the scientific story of why it was important to do and how it was transformed by the discovery of the Kuiper belt into being the first mission to the third zone of the solar system and then these fantastic results. But it's also an under the hood. Look at how you build. What we had to do was we had a big, basically rebuild voyager much lighter and much faster and you'll appreciate this.

Speaker 3:          10:30          I think that some of the projects you do, we had to do it in half the time. And one fifth the cost. So we had to make a lot of innovations, took 2,500 men and women. I realize that Google, that's a hobby shop project, but a lot of people worked on this and they worked very hard, um, under the gun with what some folks thought were impossible. Boundary conditions. I know when we want it, we want it against the Goliath of planetary exploration. Our team wanted against JPL, the jet propulsion lab at Caltech who had been first to every plant, the solar system. We wrote the better proposal. We marketed it better. We did have the better team. And Nasa I think made the right choice because I do think, um, it's uncertain to me whether they, the guys could have pulled it off given all the constraints.

Speaker 3:          11:22          They were really old school and we were new school, but they were talented group and I had many friends on those competing teams. And nonetheless, we got it. And when we want it, um, and I can't tell you how many phone calls I got from friends that were colleagues and said, you won, but you lost. And that story's in the book. David wrote the book because they'd say, you know, great, you've won. You're now in charge of the mission to Pluto that we'll never get launched because you will either, you'll fail on schedule, it won't be your fault. It will be some vendor somewhere, you know, some critical part you need. Or you won't get nuclear launch approval because no one's done it ever in four years or even close, you know, that's 42 state and federal agencies, you know, if you, you guys use the phrase we use about her hurting cats.

Speaker 3:          12:07          Yeah, this is different. This is cats hurting themselves. It's a whole nother lives, like three dimensional chess. So, uh, uh, and then people would say, well, what do you mean a 20% of the two dimes on the dollar in? You're never going to figure that out and get it done in one of these traps will bite you. You might get through some of these hoops, but you'll never get through all of them. And fortunately, our team was very dedicated, dedicated to nights and weekends. Uh, uh, the, the primary players were southwest research institute where I work, the applied physics lab, Apl at Johns Hopkins, uh, and Lockheed Martin for the launch vehicle, the Department of energy for the nuclear power supply. Um, by the way, because Google is a restaurant, we used to call APL always a pizza lunch cause the only thing they would ever serve pizza like I, the number of pizzas I ate or in scientific notation.

Speaker 3:          13:11          Anyway, this, this book tells all those stories and it's, the stories are woven together. The science, the politics, the how you build this, how you fly an interplanetary mission across the solar system. Some of the technologies we invented like spacecraft, hibernation, the navigation requirements that were super stringent, um, hit a 40 by 60 kilometer window from 3 billion miles away. And Oh, by the way, and do that while arriving within nine months, minutes of the time you aim for when you launched nine years before and do all that. Um, and you only get one shot. There's no voyager two here. There's no new horizons to, to back it up. There's no making a uturn. We're going 14 kilometers a second, get it right or go home. Um, and it all worked out. Although we had a near death experience, which the book begins with July 4th, 2015 a day meant for other kinds of fireworks.

Speaker 3:          14:01          And my cell phone rings and I pick it up for even picking it up. I saw it was the guy, it's our project manager and he's not calling me on the 4th of July because he's having a great barbecue before he ever got the sentence through his mouth. You know, I could tell from the gravity of his voice, he said, Alan, we've lost contact with the spacecraft. That just doesn't happen. It's not like when your computer reboots, right. It'll be fine in five minutes. Um, so, um, it, it's a really interesting read and I don't think there's any book that's like it. Um, we were on the John Bachelor show in Manhattan this weekend and he kept saying, you wrote a movie and we hope we wrote a movie because it's a really interesting story and it's not just for tech heads, but it's also a story of drama and persistence.

Speaker 3:          14:52          Uh, by people with a dream that actually managed despite a lot of issues along the way to pull off what they didn't know how to do when we started. And I'd be happy to answer questions if you have some, uh, and, and talk about this, but I want to tell one story before I stopped. Um, I've never told this story before. Um, but, um, uh, I worked at NASA for a time and when I left, this is NASA headquarters. I ran the science program and, uh, and that's a big enterprise. It's about five and a half billion dollars a year and not big by Google standards, but I hadn't left about 10 days and Eric Schmidt invited me to come out to Palo Alto for, offer me a job and I said no, which may have made the difference between whether we explored the Pluto system or not. I mean, in the end. Thank you, Eric watching. Um, that was a really enticing job. Um, but you know, I'll be back on the market after we finished exploring the corporate belt anyway, so I thought I'd just tell that little anecdote. Um, and then Dave wants to come back up here and, uh, I don't know if I was just books been out less than a week, so probably no one in the room has read it. But if you have any questions about planetary exploration, certainly astrobiology uh, or uh, Pluto, the Kuiper belt or new horizons have at it.

Speaker 1:          16:18          You know, I just have to say, one of the great things about working with Alan on this book is that, uh, he got a lot of great stories and we, uh, the first step of us writing this book together was we talked to every Saturday really for a year and a half. And he just told me stories and I asked him questions and we figured out the structure of the book and uh, um, but I never heard that story before. That's a new, there are a lot of stories. Yeah. Anyways, we can put in a thousand page book and know, do you guys want to know? Yeah, so obviously there was a ton of build up to actually launching, but once it actually launched, what was that? Nearly a decade waiting like every day. You have to check in and make adjustments or is it manages itself and you just stress for nine years. Explain what that's like.

Speaker 3:          17:06          Um, the most succinct answer would be yes to all those things. Um, it was intimidating to think about nine and a half years when we first launched it. That just seemed to me like forever. I mean on my 12 year is going to be 21, I can't even picture Jordan 21. Uh, that kind of thing. And I think all of us felt that way. Um, one thing people don't know and the book does describe it is that, um, while people think that, you know, Oh, a lot of people know the spacecraft was hibernating so they think we were hibernating. We had nothing to do. But let me put this in context. When voyager flew across the solar system, they had a staff of 450 people run the spacecraft to do the science team or the management to do everything. My team was large when we were building it, but within a month of launching it, we let everybody go.

Speaker 3:          18:02          We didn't need a launch vehicle team anymore. We didn't need the department of energy anymore. We don't need a big engineering kid is nothing off to build. We just put a lot of spares and controlled inventory and we had already done all the documentation and we just kept some engineering leads. And so we were 50 people. That's like the number of people in this room to do every part of it. From the flight controllers to the engineers, to the science team, to the management team, to the public affairs, all that. And uh, we were incredibly busy. There's a chapter, it's one of my couple of favorites in the whole book called Battle Plan Pluto where we tell the story of how you actually plan. I'm a fly by like this where the spacecraft is operating completely burned, no control, all the software and all the support files have to be completely tested in every way you can think of.

Speaker 3:          18:52          And how we had to plan for fly bys because we were worried we would find hazards, debris that can strike the spacecraft on approach. So we picked different aim points and we could choose among them, but the point at which you would choose was so close to the moment of fly by that you had to have the software on the shelf. There was no, oh now we'll write a different plan. Each plan takes like a year to develop and test, so we had to do this four times and on top of it we had, we put intelligent software up on the bird that could detect 160 something faults. The fuel was leaking at the computers, getting bad messages for this or that. We lost comm, whatever, and then we'd run down a checklist. It could even as it ran down the checklist decision in branch based upon data.

Speaker 3:          19:36          So it would act as if you had a crew member on board. We had to write and test all that stuff. We conducted mission simulations in which we fake the clocks out on the, on the bird in flight in the middle of nowhere between Uranus and Neptune. It thinks it's 2015 it's doing nine days of every pointing. We ship all that data back and makes sure every star field is exactly the one you intended, right? Um, every instrument was operating at the right voltage, every little thing. Um, we had 40 mission simulations, the bottom line, all this, and I'm only telling you part of the story is, um, we worked our butts off for nine years. Um, Alice Bowman, who's the woman who runs up my mission control, um, you know, many times came to me and said, this is too much work for this team. We have to take content out. We've got a separate icing from cake. And, and she called it a nine and a half year sprint. Right? It was tough and the spacecraft was hibernating a lot, but this little team, um, it was, it was incessant and all of a sudden Pluto was there and a lot of people were coming and saying, wait a minute, can we put the brakes on? You know, I actually don't want, want to save her this. It's coming too fast. So thanks. That's a great question. By the way. They, the hibernation, um,

Speaker 1:          20:48          that Allen mentioned was itself a really, uh, innovative part of this mission. That was a brilliant solution to how do you have a spacecraft traveling for nine and a half years and not be worn out when you get there. And also have the human resources to do all that planning and simulating that Allen was talking about with a really small team. It was part of how they answered this question, how do we do something on a tiny fraction of voyagers budget? And that allowed them to have a smaller ground him cause they weren't running the spacecraft the whole time, but it was, it was something they had to learn how to do that. And we talk about that in the book. They practice hibernation at first they put it to sleep for, you know, a couple of days and then a week and then a month to make sure that it works. And that innovation and, and a lot of the other ones they came up with are now part of space exploration and other missions are using them.

Speaker 3:          21:34          Uh, just say one thing and then I'll call on this gentleman, but you got to ask me before the, you all came in the room about how long it took to get the data to the ground. You know, the dirty little secret is we did that to save money is we have, we intentionally chose that. If you could take nine years to reach Pluto, you could spend one more year to get all the data back. Voyager was seventies technology at Neptune almost as far as Pluto head anytime right there behind you, a little two meter addition, Tenet, small. We, we had one 10th the data rate of voyager intentionally because we realize what an enormous cost savings it was. You say, well, how much cheaper can a smaller antenna beat? It's not the antenna. He said, well, how much cheaper can you know? Lower powered transmitter speed.

Speaker 3:          22:18          They save you millions, but millions is small in an 800 and something million dollar project. What it really was, was that if we had lower power transmitters, I could graduate down from to like voyager to one nuclear power supply and those babies cost 80 million a piece. So by, by accepting lower data rates, we made this very intelligent compromise that we would take a whole year and a little more to get the data back in exchange for the, you know, that's almost a hundred million dollars right there. So there were a bunch of those and we talk about them. Sorry for the detour. Yes.

Speaker 4:          22:54          Um, in your opinion, what was the scientific knowledge we gained about Pluto or of having these kind of,

Speaker 3:          23:07          Oh God, which 1:00 AM I right

Speaker 4:          23:08          children because thought is okay, so we got, doesn't have what doesn't have a core, that's all interesting piece of information but not as shocking, but you know what, fuck this. Appreciate it.

Speaker 3:          23:27          Yeah. Um, I don't think there's an answer to that actually. You know, different people would say different things. And there's a third thing too, and actually the book ends, the last two and a half pages is a Coda to the book that actually talks about the biggest impact and the greatest discovery was how much it affected people. Just people just inspired people to stem careers and was, you know, a moonshot for a new generation of, uh, of, uh, millennials basically and how it affected them. So, but all those things are good. We don't have to choose between them. We've got all the scientific knowledge, all the breakthroughs and how you do low cost space flight to the planets. We got all the engineering advances and we got all the inspiration. So there's no reason to rank them there. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          24:15          And you never have one without the other because without the motivation for the exploration, you're not going to have a mission with all that technical innovation. But without all the technical innovation, you're not going to have a mission and get the science. But, but you know, it wasn't just odd has a core or something. It actually was fundamental what we've learned there and, and changed our paradigms and will truly, it sounds like a cliche, but we truly require textbooks to be rewritten because we did not expect a small planet on the fringes of the solar system to be so geologically active and diverse and vibrant and, and parts of it to be quite young and still currently forming. And that was something we had to, you know, go back to the drawing boards and now, um, have some provisional explanations. But that, you know, that's how that's really what drives science, uh, is this exploration that then leads to results that, uh, you know, that shows us that our prediction and our previous knowledge was wrong and requires us to really a re reinvent our theories of planetary evolution. And New Horizons has done that.

Speaker 3:          25:18          You might say, you know, you might imagine this, but as a science team, everybody want to make predictions. And we actually had a poll and we, we had a meeting a couple months before the fly by and one of my postdocs, Amanda's and gory, ran the pole. There were like 30 questions and you know, we had a little little team that put together the questions, everybody answered them and we put the results in the computer of course, and we're plotting the distribution of the histogram of how many satellites do you think we will find or how many people think that we'll find evidence for active volcanism on the surface or whatever the questions were. And so, uh, and then we showed that to everybody. And then a couple of months after the flyby when we had enough data to sort of understand the lay of the land, um, I scored that against the real Pluto and it was pitiful. And so like I gave the team, I literally passed out report cards. Yes. And they gave all A's for exploration and F's for scientific predictive ability. Yes. Yeah. Firstly, thank you for the monkeys reference.

Speaker 1:          26:16          Is the, your subtitle optimistic about first mission or do you know of upcoming missions?

Speaker 3:          26:23          Oh, both. Both. Both. And we actually almost, we had a debate about whether, I mean, there's only been one mission, so I would just say first, right. It's just the epic mission to Pluto. Isn't that enough? Um, uh, but first it's one of those words that it's like an Seo thing, right? It's got to get people to look at it. Um, but we do expect that there will be more missions because I, and we originally thought that this was, that we could go in with 21st century instrumentation and accomplish and we did about the equivalent of the first 20 years of Mars exploration in one fell swoop. Uh, and we did, but we learned many things that are, make my head hurt. And so w we're working very hard to see an orbiter fly there and follow up and I think there'll be now other missions to small planets in the Kuiper belt because we want to sample the diversity of this new population. I think if Pluto was that interesting and some of the things we know from ground based and the huddle soon we'll know from James Webb. Um, I think that will also want to look at, at some of the others for comparison. So I expect there'll be a lot more of this. Yes.

Speaker 4:          27:32          The risk of being a little bit to weigh in on the merits of manned space exploration versus for Monica space exploration. And I, I asked this one is because we living in a positive in front of the country as citizens get to me in on where we put our dollars. Do you think, do you think the public's perception of this is aligned with your perception of this?

Speaker 3:          27:55          Oh, well that's a different question, but I will weigh in and I was, so you said weigh in on the merits of robotic space flight versus human space flight. Right. So I might translate that question to an equivalent question. Would you please weigh in for me on the merits of a knife and fork and a spoon at the table? Um, my point is they're all different tools for different purposes and at the table you really need all three. It's really hard to do your soup with a fork and it's, it's really hard to cut your steak with just the spoon or the fork. And so human space flight and robotic space flight are really very different tools. I don't know anybody in this time that would say you need human space flight to do weather satellites, communication satellites and a lot of the applications, but it's still the case that humans make much better, um, field analysis teams then the rovers that we have now, Apollo teams would cover about as much ground scientifically in a three day expedition as a rover mission can't in five years.

Speaker 3:          29:03          Uh, and they can make on the spot discoveries that robots can. Um, so I think we need both all the tools and the, you know, we're not going to be sending people to Pluto anytime soon. Um, but on the other hand, at places like the moon and Mars and maybe series and smaller asteroids, the humans can really push the pedal to the metal and the humans do something. Even though new horizons was a good example of being inspirational, it's hard for the 23rd mission to Mars for that, that particular robot to really light people's fire. Whereas when we send men and women, it, it will be unbelievable in terms of the worldwide response. And that's what fuels the tech economy in a space as the gateway drug to engineering and science careers. Well dinosaurs too, but the dinosaurs always lose. Right? So it's really space. Who else? Yes.

Speaker 4:          29:58          How long did it take after march for you read the paper or see a tech report and wish that was something you had had

Speaker 3:          30:07          on board? Yes. So we've talked about that too. And, and so the two ways to look at that and the only realistic way to look at it is given the, the boundary conditions on money and schedule and the, and the Arrow that we built it between 2001 and five, what would you do differently? That means a zero sum game. You have to find the money, the mass, the resources by taking something else off. And, uh, there's no instrument or capability on New Horizons that we wish we would trade, that we would lose in order to do something else. Now with the orbiter, which will be a much more capable spacecraft in a much, um, uh, a wider variety of payloads on board instruments will do lots of things we couldn't do with a simple fly by, but I wouldn't trade anything if I really could just, you know, have my wish it would have been that we had enough money to fly to because the far side of Pluto and its satellites is, you know, we can only see them for millions of kilometers away as we were screaming up and then they turned away. And it's frustrating. You look at the other side of Pluto and it looks completely different and fascinating. And what does that have to teach us, you know, and, uh, I'm really betting on life extension so that I can be Pii. That next mission. Yeah. Right here

Speaker 4:          31:31          it was a publicly funded, at a timeless, not clear what the future holds for that. Um, what do you think is likely to happen? What do you think should happen in terms of public versus private funding for this thing?

Speaker 3:          31:42          Well, fortunately, and everybody here probably knows this, this is that, um, uh, commercial spaces coming on very strong. And I admit I am a very highly biased and also happened to be the board chair of the commercial spaceflight federation, which is the industry of Federation that blue origin and, and space x and everybody else's in 80 corporations from small mom and pop almost shops, you know, all the way up to space x and blue origin. Uh, uh, but I think again, it's not a choice between one and the other. Um, this is a huge solar system with dozens of worlds. And you know, I, I don't, I don't know how we would, we would do all the things that we do on the season in the air if it was all done by just the air force and the navy. Right. And besides, if it's one organization, you can't possibly have the level of innovation that you get through competition.

Speaker 3:          32:45          And so I think all that's going on at places like blue origin and SpaceX and all the others is it's finally the 21st century where we don't just have one space program but lots of them. And now we're starting to have, uh, the asteroid miners and the moon miners and lots more applications being talked about. And I think the 20s are going to be just spectacular, but also what NASA is going to be doing in the 20s, which you would not see. Um, uh, uh, commercial enterprise is exploring Europa for scientific knowledge, but you might see commercial enterprises sending payloads to Mars, uh, because they can, uh, they can find customers that want to fly those now. So sort of the vanguard, the leading edge I think is always going to be the government in most respects. Um, but, uh, private industries, what comes in and, and really turns it into part of the economy and what we do. And we need both.

Speaker 1:          33:45          And nobody at NASA that I know, we both know a lot of people at NASA. I know nobody. There is a, you know, bummed out that, oh, now that we have these competitors from frappe from private industry, they're like, oh great, you know, we don't have to be the trucking service up to orbit or the bus service, you know, we can focus on other things that only NASA can do. And um, so the private public partnership is really being sought by both sides in that equation and is shaping up to really accelerate space space exploration in the in this century.

Speaker 3:          34:16          Yeah. And Jim Bryden Stein, who the new NASA administrator really gets it with public private partnerships. I think he's going to be great. I'm left handed, so I've been biasing to this side of the room. Is there any question over here? Yes. Um, so this is not the only recent, uh, exploratory mission to an IFI body in the solar system because we also had the Rosetta probe, uh, to the comment. I was wondering if there was anything, especially in the astrobiology factor, maybe that stood out like that was surprisingly different or suppressing the same between Pluto and the comic. His name, I forgot. Well, can I just say Jeremy Knauff gear? Reza Minka

Speaker 1:          34:58          very nicely done. Well, I was on the Rosetta mission. Yeah. 22 years. Yeah. So we do call it CG. It was too much. So, so Alan can, I can probably comment, you know, more in a more sophisticated way about the comments since he's on that mission. But I will say from an astrobiology perspective, one of the amazing things about new horizons and Pluto is the, uh, evidence that there is an ocean of liquid water beneath the icy crust of Pluto. Uh, it seems like there, there's circumstantial evidence that, you know, there are features of the planet that are easiest to explain if there is a liquid water ocean. And one of the things that would definitely to do with this orbiter Alan's talking about if we go back, is map the, the gravity field and do other things to really make sure we understand that that's true. But it seeming like there is an ocean of liquid water, which is amazing from an astrobiology perspective because any place where there's an ocean of water is a candidate for extra terrestrial life. So, just as you've heard about Europa and Enceladus as possible homes for life underneath the ice, we really have to add, plead out to that list now.

Speaker 3:          36:06          Yeah. And you know, keep in mind, so I was Pi of the ultraviolet spectrometer and Rosetta. Okay. So we won that project in the beginning of 1996 and flight mission and in 2016 and actually the data analysis part of the project is still ongoing. Um, but you know, the comments CG, the one with all the syllables is about the size of Cambridge mass and Pluto is the surface area, the United States. So it's a different scale and the kind of science you're doing is very different. What else?

Speaker 4:          36:38          Yup. What, what's like the biggest, um, what was the most frustrating mistake that you look back on of like, oh, we didn't do this right if I need to go back and change one thing. What was the biggest takeaway?

Speaker 3:          36:52          Wow, that's a good question. Um, I honestly, the way, the thing that nearly killed the spacecraft 10 days out, but it, sure it brought a lot of viewership the last minute. And all of a sudden it's life or death. What,

Speaker 1:          37:08          there were some other mistakes that, that, that, uh, we described in the book, but, you know, fortunately none of them were fatal because we have a success story. Right? So, but I mean, but they're illustrative. There was that, uh, you know, I mean, one thing you learn in this book is how carefully everything was checked by independent teams and you know, like just a lot of amazing troubleshooting and very little slip through. But there was one spreadsheet where, um, one, a thruster had the wrong specs and was built and flown with the wrong specs so that it was going to fire too many times, uh, and exhausted lifetime before they got to put out. And they discovered this when they were in flight and they were able to, uh, to make some work arounds. But that was a, that was sort of almost the exception that proves the rule because there were, so, it was almost nothing like that, but it was really illustrative of why it was so important that they do all the ridiculous amount of checking and double checking, uh, console. So little slip through, but that, that was, you know, it made me not the worst mistake, but it's an illustrative mistake. Yeah, yeah,

Speaker 3:          38:09          yeah. Um, I'm really, I'm sorry, I really don't have a good answer because most of the things that I think I did wrong or we did wrong actually in the end worked out better. So for example, if I could do it again, some of the things I was doing in the 90s to lead the effort to get a mission to Pluto, I think now with more experience, I could've made it happen, but, but then I would've just been a bit player on that mission instead of been to lead the whole thing. So I don't want to make that happen. So it was a lot more fun. Yeah. You Go,

Speaker 4:          38:42          I have a question with regards again and lot of the story here in force around politics and political struggle. And I was wondering the fact that Pluto at some point was demoted or was it part of a political game? How can you explain?

Speaker 3:          38:58          I don't think it was a political game. Um, there, there are really two things that were going on. One is I think appreciated by a lot of people, which is I think especially here you have this fixation, no astronomers, not planetary scientists, different expertise. When I give a public talk, you know, I say neurologists and podiatrist's don't go to one for problem with the other, right, different expertise. But people in the public, including my own mother, confuses that all astronomers must know everything about everything in space. They were really trying to cope with large numbers of planet discoveries and thinking in a 20th century way. I would say that the number of planets should be small so children can remember their names, right? Um, um, they should have, I wish that they'd just been consistent and not gone on for an head motions. They'd voted on other things they don't know about and just gone ahead and legislate it.

Speaker 3:          39:50          We're only also going to have eight elements in eight states now, but, but they didn't. So the press picked up on it and the press is also naively took it as expertise, you know, and, and sort of made it a feta complete when people like David and myself and others in planetary science and joining profession of a different expertise, never said that and don't buy it and don't even by the idea of voting in science because it's sort of an illegitimate process, right? We could all vote that, um, three of evolution is wrong. It doesn't matter how many Nobel laureates vote for it. That doesn't mean that the data doesn't support the theory. Okay. Um, the other thing that was going on, and it's very rarely discussed, but it's the fact is that in 1980 on astronomer named Brian Marsden, who was very accomplished, had a very public tiff with the man who discovered Pluto named Clyde Tombow. And he, he actually said at a meeting in front of a lot of people, you're older than me, and when you're gone, I will erase your legacy. And Marsden is the person that led the IAU that week to pass that resolution,

Speaker 3:          41:03          uh, which took Pluto off the strong hummers list. And so

Speaker 1:          41:09          there's a lot of bad blood. And if you look at the specific technical description in, in the IAU Aaus attempt to at redefining planet, uh, just from a of scientific quantitative perspective, it doesn't make any sense. It they did a sloppy job. Well for one thing, they set a planet has to orbit the Sun. They ignored all the exoplanets is ridiculous. But also, even within our own solar system, they have this criteria that a planet must, a supposedly they said it must clear it zone. So they define the planet in terms of what orbits around it and not its own intrinsic properties. And that leads to some very silly, absurd conclusions like that earth was not a planet for its first 500 million years because it was orbiting in a swarm of material left over from the formation of the sun. And if you took earth today and move to somewhere else, say out in the asteroid belt or something, it would not be a planet.

Speaker 1:          42:05          Um, so there, there are a lot of just sort of unsatisfying aspects of the definition. So it certainly made sense to, um, to talk about classifying Pluto and other small planets like it as a different subclass of planets dwarf planets that that's fine. But then they sort of added this and a dwarf planet is not a planet and it was kind of vindictive and nonsensical. And, uh, so in planetary science at our meetings, you'll hear us referring to Pluto as a planet. Um, and you know, we almost kind of don't really even want to want to talk about this except for, I mean, it is worth talking about because people are confused in and they want to know and so we have to try to clarify it. He said, we don't want to talk about it, but yesterday in the Washington Post, two of us had an op Ed. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          42:47          How many plants are there on your list? Oh, I'm comfortable. So yeah, that's really the answer. No. So I'll known it's in the mid twenties in our solar system, in our solar system. But of course there are thousands of known planets around other stars, but you know, who cares? You know, there's countless mountains and rivers and stars and asteroids and galaxies and all those things, you know, spaces all about Oh, astronomical numbers. So we really need to get over the notion, the notion that there were small number of planets, I think is equivalent to like some, somebody who grew up on a desert island where they were accountable number of palm trees. And you think that's it for the world because you don't see any other islands. So you know, they're all over the rise and then you develop the technology for ocean travel, right? And you can now go to other places and you discover that all those trees, you gave them names, right? There's so many. You can't name them all. So you decide those aren't actually palm trees for whatever reason, just to keep it small. So it's kind of crazy. Okay. I guess we're going to say thank you for that.
