Speaker 1:          00:06          Welcome to all of you. Welcome to the math circle which is extremely peculiar because we never teach anyone anything. It's a school without lectures, without textbooks, without grades, without tests, without homework. What does it have left math and the beauty of it and collegial conversation. Never competitive people. A very small group of people. Always 10 is about our maximum with a leader. All the leader does is put accessible mystery in front of them and accessible mystery something which really leads behind the appearances to the underlying structure. Our book, the art of the infinite has 10 of those mysteries in it. Hidden structure which it takes a lot of imagination, goodwill conversation with one another to uncover, to come to grips with and still have doubts at the end but informed doubts. Our motto, well, one of them is learning to speak our loss native language, but another is tell me that I forget asked me and I discover and not only do the students in the master goal to teach one another and the what that hidden structure is in their discoveries, but they come to admire one another and have self, their own self esteem increased because they're not being told things, they're discovering them.

Speaker 1:          01:56          But look, what am I doing? I'm telling you things because this is wrong. You should be discovering for yourself with a math circle is. So let's give you a demonstration. Let's guys, here's the question. I'm going to draw a, a grid of five by five grid. By grid I mean kind of a chess board. Um, five lines. We'll have five spaces for squares. You don't want me for, this is weird. I need six lines to get five horizontal spaces. So I guess I'm going to need six.

Speaker 2:          02:46          Yes.

Speaker 1:          02:49          Vertical lines to get, how many squares do I have? Are you sure? Yes. Okay. No, I'll take your word for it. One, two, three, four, five. That might be. I was counting I, I didn't hear him. He say one.

Speaker 3:          03:16          You're sure you have a very orderly mind. Okay.

Speaker 1:          03:22          One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10 1112 1314 51617181920

Speaker 3:          03:33          oh, I forgot. Sorry. I'll take your word for it. They're 25 wonderful idea. Okay. I'm gonna learn a lot from you guys.

Speaker 1:          03:48          If you were to start in the upper left and square, do I have that right? Okay. Thank you. If you were to start there and draw a line that's going to go through all the squares each square once and only once, and never take your chore off the Board or your pen off the paper even when to go up and down and left and right. Okay. Is it possible to do that starting from here or probably not possible? Yes. I think. What do, what do you think? You think it's possible? I don't think so. Yep. Come on, Joey.

Speaker 1:          04:30          Oh, fantastic. Okay. I'm convinced. Thank you. That's, that's great idea. Thank you. Do you agree that's the only way you can do that? That's terrific. Samuel, you, it could come and Shelby. Okay. All Yours Samuel. Oh, oh, that's neat. And I forget if we can get to the, Oh, you've got to the middle of one. Terrific. Terrific. Thank you very much. So there are two ways of doing it. Yes. Petra, come on. Really? You're saying there's a third way? Yes. Oh, you're doing it kind of in the rotated way. It's [inaudible] kind of rotated 90 degrees. Beautiful. There are three there. Wait a minute. Daniel. Daniel, how many ways are there going to be over a hundred over a hundred. Nathan, did you calculate this or no? I'm sorry. I should've said can't go diagonally. Only up and down and left and right. It was a brilliant idea. I liked diagonal lines as a lot of, you know, but not here.

Speaker 3:          05:59          And we've asked this one and then covered that and then cover that and then do it like that. Show me Daniel without the dad. She'd go diagonally down. You stops here and then you and then you go up and then when my dad and then you can do that with the out using a diagonal with an up and down motion down all the way up, all the way you want. You want to connect that back up there. Oh, that's nice. You've got to kind of a revelation of a castle. One, two, three, four, five. I think. One, two, three, four, five, one, two, three, four, five. You were right. This is an extra box of mine.

Speaker 3:          07:23          Okay. Then go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead. Wait, wait. You had a good question. They have to have to conduct definitely one continuous line. I think this is really nice. Daniel does his work as a hundred you say forever, which is more or less forever a deal. Fantastic. Hold onto it. Okay, Daniel, this is great. Thanks a lot. I remember where you were ever getting news. How about usher? Petra. Petra? I'm not sure it's the question. It's, it's one of the questions that that I thought of and you've got to come up with fantastic

Speaker 1:          08:56          answers. One, two no, three no four, no, 100, no one infinite number. Oh, sure. And then while I'm doing this thing for yourself, decide the question of how many ways are there, we know there were at least three or four and there might be a hundred. There might be an infant room. Yeah, there's not an infinite number. Why not? Because like eventually you're going to actually, you have to have an infinite number of boxes to have an infinite number of what a great idea. Okay.

Speaker 2:          09:34          Okay.

Speaker 1:          09:37          One, two, three, four, five, one, two, three, four, five. Okay.

Speaker 1:          09:51          Oh, this is like Danielle's. Oh Yup. Patrol is telling him something. I don't think the chocolates make lesions. Oh, that's great. Oh, sure did. Was to combine previous ideas. That's doing math. That's taking previous, I promise I'll come to you later immediately. Uh, taking, building on these ideas together. You're working collegially it's just super with uh, kind of top of a castle. You see those Tufts up a castle and then some of the straight line right down the middle. Could it have been elsewhere and then zip over and do the zigzag backward. It's really nice. By the way, your your letter, he is hiding in here. Okay. Um, Leah, different from all these, okay. Come on up. Maybe there really are an infinite number. Think about another question. Besides how many ways, sorry. When do you accidentally going to copy one of the ones that you are such a good question. Is anyone keeping track of whether we're going to be doing something again that we did before or you rememory so good. Mine isn't that. You'll remember all the previous ones. Very good point. Um, or are you worried that yours might be an old one?

Speaker 1:          11:28          Okay. If you're pretty sure not, that means it must be a different, a different basic idea. I'm actually kind of surprised nobody did it. Okay. It shows that although we all have mines and they're all terrific, our minds work differently.

Speaker 3:          11:58          Oh, oh, stop for a second. Does anybody worried? Yeah. You're worried. Yeah. You're worried. Okay. Step aside for a second. Don't, don't say why you're worried, but you're both worried. Anybody else worried? You're worried? Go ahead. Oh,

Speaker 2:          12:27          I actually,

Speaker 3:          12:32          oh, you're really seeing things. You're seeing things that don't work. Which kind of tells you what does work. Go ahead. Oh, excellent. You avoided the problem of having two directions. You had to go in and you could want to go in one. Beautiful. I do think that's new, isn't it? Yeah. Okay. That is super. You guys are amazing. You idea having other ones. Okay. Come on up. Can I leave this and give you a pink shawl? Okay.

Speaker 3:          13:16          Oh, that's a nice, that's really nice. Looking at this, looking at the pink one at pink one, can you automatically see another one that hasn't been done automatically? Great. Leah? I think I do. Don't come up and tell me. Looking at the pink mine, do you automatically, let me, let me recite the pink line. Start here. Go right all the way. Go down all the way. Go across all the way. Go up part of the way up to the fourth square and then start wiggling down and stop there. Yes, Nathan minds, but I think you'll have to.

Speaker 3:          14:11          Okay. Yes. So you took part of what you did and changed it. Nice idea. Wait, actually, no, we shouldn't be there. I know. Losing track of whether repeating anything's we had. One of the things we had before. That's, that's terrific. You guys have an enormous amount of imagination because math is done with one's imagination. Let me ask you a question before you pick up your, you're basically running this class, not me, but I have, I've got a question. I'm going to take one of the paths. I know it was done. If fact, the very first one, I want you to tell me something.

Speaker 1:          14:53          Here's that first path.

Speaker 2:          15:06          I forget where the

Speaker 1:          15:11          like that. Am I right? Yeah. Okay. Without doing anything, without asking me to do anything more. Tell me a second path that's there. Yes. Yes.

Speaker 4:          15:26          It's the same phone

Speaker 1:          15:30          start to finish. Is it a star finish? Every time you draw one path you get one more for free. That means whether the number is 200 or infinite. It's going to have to be even because for every path you draw there's the path with the end of the beginning of reversed. So weird. Well that's, there are at least two paths. There are at least four. I mean there are at least six. I mean, what do I mean there are at least a hundred there might be 99 yes,

Speaker 4:          16:11          we had five and then it gets the point you made Talton yeah. Yup. Good. Myself,

Speaker 1:          16:27          I got a different sort of a question. This is work so well and we haven't even began to finally settle on how many times you can do it. Starting here is there, this is a weird question. Is there any other place you could have started that would have worked at all or as well? Leah.

Speaker 4:          16:48          Okay,

Speaker 1:          16:51          star here. How do you know about is going to work?

Speaker 4:          16:55          Well, you can just go the opposite way.

Speaker 1:          16:59          Terrific possible start possible start. Petra

Speaker 4:          17:03          starts in the sector.

Speaker 1:          17:07          Hey, that's wonderful. We had a path that ended in the setter. Therefore there has to be a path that starts from the center. Asher,

Speaker 4:          17:14          so ending up what she said. All right. That you could start on the top right corner. You could actually get old ones we've currently done. You could just turn them right,

Speaker 1:          17:25          rotate the board instead of rotating our drawing deal. What were you gonna say?

Speaker 4:          17:34          Any part on the boy would be a possible solution, but you just have to alter the wrong.

Speaker 1:          17:39          Fantastic. You could start in any square so far. We know you can start then this one and this one

Speaker 3:          17:50          and this one and this one and in the center or in this one? This one. In this one and this one or there. I'm just doing the, taking the endings and going back to the beginnings. I seem to have gotten the same thing. There are at least five places you can start from and your suggestion is we could start absolutely anywhere and just be careful. Okay. I want to take what you suggested. Dhea, you feel pretty much in charge of this question right now? Yeah, Nathan, so I was wondering, can I show? Yeah, yeah. Come on up.

Speaker 3:          18:30          Okay. What an interesting idea. Okay. Could you go like you lifted your truck, you lifted your truck, you can't lift your truck. Nevertheless, you can do what you wanted I think without lifting your truck here, let me, let me just, I mean you could, I was just wondering if you could use to start going and push it off two ways. Your question is, can you for, I could do it without lifting. Go ahead. Oh, watch out for this guy. Okay. I'll be much more precise. You're asking me to be more precise in my language without lifting your chalk and without going over the same line the second time.

Speaker 3:          19:40          Only once. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. I've just drawn that line. 7,981 times, haven't I? They're all next to one another. I think Nathan, you could still get your pattern. Do it. Oh yeah, right to question. If you could go two ways. Gotcha. That's a really nice other question which we should explore. Nathan's brought up completely new question. Take a five by five grid or, or of four, two by two grid aren't. They're twofold. Double paths that'll work and if so, how many? In other words instead of going like that. Could you go like that and then like that where something like that. Interesting question. Yes. Daniel. Or if you have two arms, cause you have to have two hands for the piece of, if you're an octopus you can do eight, right?

Speaker 4:          20:50          You can also program a robot to like three or nine.

Speaker 1:          20:54          Very good. I want to get back to something to do. You're raised going back to our original, um, whoops. Our original five by five. Do you said, tell me if I'm, if I'm quoting you correctly, do they really, you can start from any square as long as you're careful. Right.

Speaker 4:          21:15          But any place that's like next to the corner, you can't start there.

Speaker 1:          21:27          A fascinating idea. Let's see. Let's see, one, two, three, four, five. I'll, I'll try to be really careful in drawing this. You were saying starting in a place next to a corner, where would you like me to start from? By the way? Somebody suggested at the very beginning that we do something which would make talking about this sport.

Speaker 3:          21:53          Remember what it was,

Speaker 1:          21:55          what I was counting the squares where I was counting all 25 of them and I was counting this way and that we'll say it again. Yes. What should go in rows. There was something besides my finger that somebody suggested I do.

Speaker 4:          22:15          You played mark every square. You've already, she wouldn't double count, but you could still do that.

Speaker 1:          22:22          What do you want to market with? What do you want to market with? I was thinking how sure of your question about is this all going to be geometry? It could be something else.

Speaker 4:          22:37          Well, it's not geometry, but like, I mean I met like, Hey,

Speaker 1:          22:46          what do you mean equation math? Go on. What do we equations involve numbers. What if I mark these scores with numbers? Somebody said at the beginning, why don't you just number the squares?

Speaker 4:          22:58          I like it takes longer, but you could actually, I was thinking when I said that more about speed and not really. I know, I know, but I think you can count by fives. You can count by fives.

Speaker 1:          23:14          I'm good at it. Last time. What I did was I counted in this way, but I could really be very regular and count like this if I put these numbers in just to make it easier to talk about when Dhea suggested I start in a square next to a square in the corner. I guess she meant square number two. Oh, thanks for filling this in. 21222320420

Speaker 3:          23:46          five okay. Couldn't stay there because this way is this going to work? I can show you how you can do. That's great to hear. Thank you. Except when you go here you go. Go like this. Well actually no, not that this is wrong. Things to use Roy, that you can't start from square number two Asher and then Daniel. Oh, you all got your hands up at once then Daniel, then Samuel. Yes. You could watch that actually on the board. It's looking at what is going on with the problem that Diaz raised. Takes it over here. She can't make it easier by cause he doesn't have to go like that. He can do it here. Let's see. So are you saying two, one, six, seven, eight three, four, five, ten nine. So far so good. 14 1520 and then you go to 20,025 I don't draw that. And blue, go ahead.

Speaker 3:          25:46          This is going to work. She's retracing the previous path, but when she gets to 20, she goes down to 25 across to 24 after 20 91823221716 and skipped 13. Yes. Wait, Atlanta, another way that's going to work starting with two. Great. And Samuel, you've had your hand up for a long time starting. Maybe you could go now what? You've left out 15. Oh, right, yes. Can you put the same line and two squares? What do you mean? Like if there was one square, could you put two lines in there? Oh, no, nope. Absolutely not. Um, what the mind is a straight, steady line and it never goes back in the square in a square. It's been in, uh, what does it mean? How AQAP during down a deer could just spiral. Let's try a spiral. Go on. Go ahead. Go ahead.

Speaker 3:          27:33          Oh, yeah. Yeah. We ended 19. Yep. Stuck again. Is this something wrong with our imaginations or with the problem? Uh, Leah. Terrific. At Dia you think you have one? How about Dhea than Leah asked herself what is going on? It was so successful starting from corner with lots and lots of an even number of paths and we can't even get one starting from square two started. Well we can get it started but he can't go on one, two, three, four, five, one, two, three, four, five and we're starting to, this is going to be responsible.

Speaker 3:          28:51          It was beautiful up to there. What is wrong? Why can't we do this? You guys are so good. Yes. It's kind of wedged in between two pieces. Pieces wedged in between two pieces. Is that what you mean? Well except one piece hasn't got you your idea. Come on. This is great. This is really fascinating. Trouble we're having. I don't quite understand why we're having so much trouble with it. I mean you guys now all that you're really good at this. You're good at imagining counting. You're actually better I think at than I am and yet just saying, can we start in the second square from the quarter?

Speaker 3:          30:00          Well, prior to tribe. So far so good. Oh, thank you. Oh wait a sec. One, two, three, four, five. It's that stops here. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Stop for a second. Is it okay so far? Any trouble? Do you see any trouble in the future? You see trouble, Samuel? Where do you see trouble? Ah Ha. Okay, go ahead. So far she's avoiding that. The look what's happened. Look what's happened. You have a choice. If they've then, if Nathan's idea that we could go in two directions at once, we'd be done, but we don't have that. We can only go in one direction at once and you can either go up and you certainly are welcome to go up, but then you leave that out. You can go left and he felt that way.

Speaker 3:          31:16          Why is it so difficult? Why doesn't it work? What's the trouble with us? Yes. Fantastic. Come on up. Okay. That, that the old top of the castle. Wait, wait, wait. This just six. Sarah and Sarah. I'll just, I'll just get rid of, uh, that much. Okay. You mean there's already trouble? It's too late already. Leah, what do you think? Too late already then. I think your idea was great. Yes. Let's see what's happened here. Oh, this is okay. In other words, you've missed that square. How did I know that there was going to be a problem that's called induction. Gone Away. Oh dear. Why don't you all say the minute you see a problem coming up?

Speaker 3:          32:55          We start here. Anybody see a problem coming up? Okay. Okay. So far. Okay. Okay, so far. Why is it okay so far? Yeah, to say an idea. Okay. We know what she's the one who got one choice when she's here, she has to go this way and you choose to go all the way across everything. Okay. So far it's meant to be five by five by five. Oh, okay. Keep that idea in mind. Yes. Sasha. Wait, wait, wait, let go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead with what you've got ups, you got in the square twice.

Speaker 3:          34:22          Uh, you can't, you went and squares twice again. You want to because you want to get to that square and that's the only way you can do it and you're stuck. You're just one square off finishing it. It's interesting. And one, two, three, four, five, one, two years is five by five and you've done that. You should. We number her steps. This is one, two, three, four, five, six. I'm sorry. We don't we, well that's because I started with a number two in the corner. There still is five squares. I'm numbering now the steps instead of the roads. Uh, seven, eight, nine, 01112131415 1516 1718 61718192021 to 23. I'm not sure we're ever going to get to that. Where would a second one, two, three, four, five, one, two, three, four. Oh, sorry. My board seems to have one, two, three, four, five. Yeah, six. It's six wide. That's interesting. When it was 66 wide, it's broken by one. Oh, right. You are right. You are one, two, three, four, five. That line going through is that, it's to the point that one square, how's this worked? I might take, take a look at d as paper.

Speaker 3:          36:31          So far so good by the way. One, two, three, four, five by one, two, three, four. One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four. Wait a sec. Oh, oh, I see. Those are two. One, two, three, four, five. One, two, three, four, five. Okay, so you go down the left hand side and across the bottom. Up the right. Oh, you've gone into this square twice with this line and with that line. Oh, it was so beautiful off to there. Oh, 10 minutes left. How can this be? Can we do this for another two hours please? There we asked you what? Yes. Daniel says yes. 10 more door hours. Okay. Is it going to work when you start from the second square? Hi Nathan. What?

Speaker 4:          37:33          I can I show you some? Oh wait, I might do it on the board. Yep, please join. Racist words I think are awesome. It's basic. It's kind of the same as this, but I think our phones out we been going across. It does. Well,

Speaker 3:          37:59          I didn't, I didn't realize so I was just estimating that that might be the problem because I like to estimate some things, but why luxury estimate of a hundred is a while ago, by the way, after you asked a long time ago, is this going to be geometry? This might be arithmetic instead of geometry. I don't know. Asher and then Petra, I don't think this really counts though. So like, oh, ah, yeah.

Speaker 1:          38:37          So far that is backward. If something that I think dia did now zigzagging, stop. You'll, you'll never get into the list.

Speaker 3:          38:55          Oh yeah, yeah, exactly. Great.

Speaker 1:          39:05          I've got it for us. Funny question to ask him for Petra and Leah, how big is this board? I squares by five squares. Namely how many squares? Right squared? Five squared. True. What is five squared is 25 it's 25 what kind of a number is 25 it's a square number on the smaller number. It's an odd number. Squared. It's an odd number. Can I go back to Nathan's to buy to board to board to was what? What's two times two? This is very difficult. I know, but more or less for, I mean you estimate so it's kind of four and Alec to by two board a board with four squares. Can we start from here? Will it work? Can we start it from here? Here, here? Yes. Uh Huh.

Speaker 4:          40:06          The two by two works is that there's no square in the middle of the two corner pieces or a credit piece.

Speaker 1:          40:14          Wow. What a three by three so a three by three would or wouldn't work. Three lines. Three there is that Middle Square.

Speaker 3:          40:27          Oh,

Speaker 1:          40:35          three by three is trouble. Five by five is trouble. What's 729 by 729 trouble or easy? Actually, I got it.

Speaker 3:          40:45          I did it from, Oh actually, no I didn't. I did it because I sent him the frame here. Oh,

Speaker 1:          40:56          you started from the first square? No. Yes. Oh, he's worth from the second squared. This, this piece of Jack got, oh wait, actually no. Yep. Right. Starting from the second square. Hold on. Odd Number Board does it not work is trouble. Why Petra?

Speaker 4:          41:17          There probably is a way to do it twice. It's hard to find.

Speaker 1:          41:22          That's great. It, there's probably a way to do it, but it's hard to find that after you were saying, there's just no way to fight it no matter how you try five whole minutes. Oh, say it Osher. So I'm just gonna draw

Speaker 4:          41:34          a three by three. Okay, good. So if you start from here, you can't really do anything about it because there's, uh, there's always going to be this extra corner and if you try to eliminate that corner, I don't know, middle pieces is not going to work. See, so here you won't work because you have to, once you get to like when you to the point where it's either a corner or the center, you're always going to get there. You have to, you have to only go to one. It's going to leave the center out or one of the corners. Okay.

Speaker 1:          42:15          Is a 6.6 board go to work or not? It will because it's a seven by seven. No dear. That's terrific.

Speaker 4:          42:25          Any even number by even number, then it's going to work because like the reason sales where there's no

Speaker 1:          42:37          middle, Middle Square,

Speaker 4:          42:40          it won't cross that one odd square. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          42:44          that one. What? Square square? That one odd square on a 25 square board. Five by five. How many odd number squares are there and how many even number of squares?

Speaker 4:          42:59          Yes, I'd prefer square since it starts with an odd number, there's going to be one more.

Speaker 1:          43:06          There's always one more odd number square then even on an odd number of board and on an even number board.

Speaker 4:          43:15          Okay. Yes, Leah? Five by five. It's not, it's kind of weird but,

Speaker 1:          43:25          but I think, I think you're onto the hidden deep structure of this problem. There's always an extra odd number square on an odd number board and if you going to cover every square, you better start for them. Odd One. We are not going to cover them all because there's an extra odd one somewhere in the center or in a corner or something like that.

Speaker 4:          43:51          The number on an odd number of squares.

Speaker 1:          43:55          Fantastic guys. Leo, what do you want to say?

Speaker 4:          43:58          At the end of this, are we able to ask him a bunch of questions?

Speaker 1:          44:01          Please do. I'm not going to have any answers, but go ahead and ask.

Speaker 4:          44:08          Okay.

Speaker 1:          44:08          Oh, those are the books that Ellen and I wrote. The first one out of the labyrinth is about this approach, the mass circle approach, where we do math in the real way. If you guys doing the thinking so you own it, it's yours. This is the way we invented with no textbooks, no tests, no quizzes, no being told, but asked and people working together the way you all did fantastically to come to the deep, hidden, underlying structure of the world. The other book, the art of the infant, which is mathematics because mathematics is almost always about the infinite, the infinite number of possibilities. It has 10 different problems in it like this one which is lead you from confusion and chaos on the surface to deep structure. That makes sense. That gives meaning to a whole thing.

Speaker 4:          45:09          These are the people to afford. We have 20 minutes.

Speaker 1:          45:13          Fuck. Question. Answer. Okay. How about parents? Parents Bedroom.

Speaker 4:          45:18          If you end on square, you can do it backwards and it will be the same lines.

Speaker 1:          45:25          Absolutely. Absolutely. That's right. Start on one end on 25 in one of our patterns store on 25 and on one in the paired pattern. Asher.

Speaker 4:          45:37          Hi. Actually, I like what the art basically by my name. Matt. Hi. Actually, I'm pretty sure infinity is not a number.

Speaker 1:          45:50          You're right. It's like big and small. Infinity is not a number, but it is an idea we have. About how many, oh actually I'm sorry, how many counting numbers are there?

Speaker 4:          46:01          MMM,

Speaker 1:          46:02          well I thought there were 10,981 counting numbers. I thought they ended up, I thought the last one was 10,981

Speaker 4:          46:11          908

Speaker 1:          46:14          so anytime I name accounting number you can say, well there's one more and that must suggest there are not a finite, not an ended number of them. So the infinite is hiding behind this. How many boards those this problem work on for any possible starting place and infinite number, all the even number boards. And there are an infinite number of even numbers. Any questions along the Sterns? Yes. Yeah. How are we going to do something like this again? Oh, you mean in the master circle? Yeah, like a maybe something since you've already seen this. Only beyond this. Yeah. Maybe. Maybe. Maybe

Speaker 5:          47:02          I have a question. Oh yes, yes. Go ahead. In this setting, the beginning was just a, you know, drawing, so everybody started on the same page. What happens when you need to use more mathematical notation or machinery? The people in the class may have different levels of comfort with coming in to the circle.

Speaker 1:          47:21          The kid should invent the notation and the symbols themselves. Why use the inherited old fashioned clouded symbols? Make your own all the daf to them. The world will adapt to them. If you don't like writing fractions this way. Right? Some that way or that way or any way you choose as long as you explain what you mean. You mean that many of those kinds of things, that many of those kinds of things. 11 of the seventeens. Whereas this would mean 17 of the 11 kind of things. The numerator, it tells you the number. The denominator tells you what the denomination, the name. So I have a question. Um hmm.

Speaker 6:          48:19          One of the things that eventually happened was we switched from can you be a challenge of many of us in the audience heard, can you start from the second square as being, are you clever enough to come up with a way to start from the second square and you know, the process led to finally having to ask, can you be, can anyone, is it possible? I'm curious whether that is having done this many times. Do you, do you see that that is often a crux that these things turn on and it was

Speaker 1:          49:08          a crux on which the math circle turns a fulcrum, a widget balances, self confidence and lack of it. One comes in as a human enter this world and after just a little bit of experience loses one's nerve. And so if it cannot be done this because I can't do it until you begin to say, well, maybe, maybe nobody can do it. A great British biologist, WBS Haldane in the 1930 he said, it may not be that the universe is stranger than we think. It may be that it's stranger than we can think. Well, what if this problem? What if it turned out we hadn't come up with a solution and we came to the conclusion that, well, we've hit the boundaries of human ability. We hit the limit of our ability as you gain and self confidence, you say, listen, the world's my oyster. I control this.

Speaker 1:          50:03          Mathematics is made by humans for humans. If we can come off with a problem, we can answer it. Now, for those of you who know some history of mathematics, you know that what I've just said is a complete lie because in 1915 good, all of Austrian logician proved that there are questions you can state and state very clearly and very well, which you will never be able to answer, which is devastating. Now, the answer to good will is not. Oh yeah. But with mathematics as it's presently understood with set theory as it's presently understood, that is a limitation. But maybe the trouble is with set theory, maybe the trouble is with the way we're posing the problem, maybe we just don't have our understanding of those relations deep enough. Imagined enough yet. Why shouldn't anything be our oyster? There was a mathematician in the 17th century and Italian than Vhr who said, Nola gone problem. I saw Solaray there is no problem that can't be solved. And so Sinai, let me leave you all with a problem. This is not the end of the conversation, but let me just leave you with this problem, all of you and email me when you have some ideas. How many corners does a 10 dimensional cube have?

Speaker 1:          51:36          Think about that. Send me an answer. Three part question. Good. Ah,

Speaker 7:          51:43          first part is, are you thoroughly convinced that, uh, the problem of starting the path on the second square is impossible for all odd by odd squares and possible for all, even by even squares. Are you asking if I'm convinced I math, I might be asking the, the uh, rest of the class.

Speaker 1:          52:06          But um, they shouldn't be because we did in 40, 50, 50 minutes. What's deep complex problem. And we haven't talked about induction if that's what's on your mind. Yeah, pretty much. Exactly. Once, and this brings up an answer to a question someone else asked when I guess it a tall, when the symbolism, when the concepts become deeper, when we come to grips with induction, which we could do in 20 minutes, we can re ask that question, can you generalize even dimensional boards and how can you know that a 10,984 by 10,984 board and you can start from anywhere on, I mean it'd be really nice to say, listen, piece of cake, Yo meal.

Speaker 8:          52:58          This is just a pretty practical question, a very interesting question, but I was curious as to why you decided to start with a five by five grid instead of this three by three grid. Uh, cause it seems like maybe some of the conclusions that kids would have come up to might've been a little bit faster given the time constraints. So I was wondering if there's a creativity saying or like an exercise or I guess what led to that decision?

Speaker 1:          53:20          Really good question. I started with something which I knew was going to be beautiful, easy a piece of cake and we'd all be tremendously confident, confident enough to look at a hard aspect of it that hadn't been thought of. Stuart will it one by one and they would have run out of the room saying, what are you doing? And we of course you start in the middle of a one by one and end with, yeah, okay. Or if I'd said 10 million by 10 million, they were, I can't think in those terms. Five by five sounds comfortable. It turns out that the springs in that armchair or broken and you have to, you feel uneasy and you get more and more uneasy in it until it turns out, oh, I know how to repair those springs. I understand how it works, but you need an accessible mystery.

Speaker 1:          54:12          It's got to be appealing. It's thought to be mysterious. We were asked to do a math circle in a prison and we said, Oh, love to do that. We'll, we'll do it next year. And they said, no, do it next week. And he it. Well, we're very busy next, but you're doing it Wednesdays. All right, so Ellen and I went home and thought on God, what are we going to do? Well, we'll make sure our wills are in order. And we were worked out a routine having the prison. It was a high security prison. If you've ever been inside or visiting, it's very frightening. The guards are much more frightening than the prisoners. All your belongings are taken away from. You would put in a drawer and there's barbed wire on top of the walls. Anyway, we were put in a room and our guides left and the room was small and the people were big.

Speaker 1:          55:00          They spend their time bodybuilding. There were a 17 I counted of them and there were two of us up against the blackboard. They fill the floor. They were sitting on the floor and we said, this is the routine we'd worked out. I said, math, it's awful, isn't it? Right on. They said, Ellen said, yeah, you know, they ask you stupid questions like what's one plus two? We fell silent, somebody says three, what do you take us for? It's all of course it's three. And then that day I said your, they ask them what's one plus two plus three and voice over there six and then came words, which I will not repeat it from the audience. And while I'm saying this, Ellen has writing on the board, one plus two plus three plus four all the way up to 20 and I said, and then they asked you a question like, well what's all that out of two?

Speaker 1:          55:52          And a guy got up and said, that's why I hate about this bath thing. They ask you a town full question that nobody could ask her and get right. And even if they did, what would they come out with? Some stupid number. And we said right on, is that ever right? Yeah. And then Ellen said, if only there were a, a a nice way of doing it, a beautiful way of doing it. They said, I'll be out big fat chance. I said, yeah, if it's just some, you know, different way of counting it, voice over there, you could do 10 bonds. That's what water 10 bonds told about new terminology. So you know, one plus nine is 10 and and three plus eight is 10 no, you idiot says this guy to pesetas 10 so we get 10 bonds. Yeah, we've gotten several, well four or five 10 bonds, then we've run out of 10 bonds.

Speaker 1:          56:52          So it was that we would make 20 bonds, you know, one plus 19 said, no, we've already used the one and the 10 votes. It's hopeless. And they're getting, they're getting a physically quite restless and we're sweating. And then a little guy at the back of the room who hadn't said a word after that point said, I know this is wrong, but which is always the preface to the insight. He said, I know this is wrong, but one plus 20 is 21 and so as two plus 19 and as a sheer luck, he said, no another voice. I said, no, it's not sure a lot. They're all 20 ones. Why? What do you mean they're all 20 ones? They're all, they're all, all of them are 20 ones. Oh, what if someone says all those numbers, all those 20 numbers are 21 no, says a voiceover here.

Speaker 1:          57:41          All those thingies are our 21 what do you mean thingies? The thingies? Someone says pairs. All the pairs are 21 and I said, how many pairs are there? Someone says, they're a tet 210 high fives all around the room. Can we do another? I said, yeah, what's was Ellen said, what's The sun from one to a hundred it's a 5,050 give us another, we did this for awhile. At the end they said, what do you call this? And we said math, start with something which is below, beneath the audience's dignity, and then hit them with the mystery, which turns out to be accessible, and they are slaves to math for life.

Speaker 2:          58:41          [inaudible].
