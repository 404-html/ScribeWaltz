Speaker 1:          00:05          So I'm, I'm really pleased to introduce Dr John Barge. He's a professor of psychology at Yale University. He's been doing research in this field for over 25 years, much longer than that. Even with a focus on the unconscious. He's distilled key findings from his research in the field in general into the book that he's here to talk about today. Before you know it, the unconscious reasons we do what we do, please join me in giving him, giving him a warm welcome.

Speaker 2:          00:32          [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          00:36          thank you David. Thank you all for coming. I know you have an option during your lunch. Don't shower, don't have to be here. So I appreciate it. Um, so the book is not about the Freudian unconscious. It's a about the last 30 or 40 years of actual systematic scientific research on average normal people randomly assigned to conditions, uh, not, uh, uh, case studies of mentally ill people, uh, from which a Freud generate and generated a, it's an entire theory. Uh, it's also, um, we'll see the talk is sort of structured this way, but it's only a 30 minutes. And I'm actually, if you'd like, I'll try to speed it up and make it shorter than that. Uh, it's also not a, um, uh, what we found is that logically you probably would figure this out. It's not a separate mind. Unconscious is not some kind of separate part of the, of the brain with its own rules and with its own operating system on, on, uh, and it's locked away and you can't see it.

Speaker 3:          01:32          You probably, you remember that movie inside out with the little emotions running a control room, that animation movie, one of the little emotions did something wrong. It got thrown into this unconscious cave and the door was locked. He never saw them again. I never heard from them again. And that's not what we're talking about. It's a, it's a very different kind of thing. It's, it's one, uh, brain, uh, the research showing a affects of increasing or decreasing incentives during tasks. This is out of university college. London, uh, shows at the same brain. Regions are, are, are used, uh, become active. In either case when a motivational state as a, a conscious one or it's an unconscious one, it's the same brain region and that's pretty much true of everything. Whatever the kind of a thing you're looking at, emotion, motivation, a language, behavior. It's the same part of the brain that's operating and whether it's in conscious or unconscious mode, but it's a single unified brain.

Speaker 3:          02:23          It's basically I help the unconscious. Unconscious influences are generally helpful. They survived natural selection, they survived evolution. They're not some kind of destructive, evil, evil twin lurking inside your skull. So that's the difference between what a lot of people here and the word unconscious. And that's what they, they think of. Of course. Well, there's a disconnect though and this is why, uh, I'm organizing, uh, organize the book but also organize this talk today in terms of the past, present, and future, because we're focused almost always on the present. We're focused on what's around, what's going on in front of us, what we are aware of, right? What else could we be aware of, but what we're aware of. And so we understand the reasons for how we feel. And our decisions and and so forth based on what's available to us right now in front of us, the mind is on all three times zones at the same time.

Speaker 3:          03:08          You could influence this from the evolutionary past, very strong ones. You've got influences from your early childhood. You have no memory for any more from your first three or four years of life that carry over the rest of your life. Influences of your recent past, which just happened. The carryover, like for my case for a long time, my work life would just segue right into my home life and carry over to my understanding of what was going on at home, which was wrong. Uh, but also your future, your motivations, your goals, your aspirations, things you're trying to attain, whether it's a longterm life goal, have a family, have a successful career, be happy, uh, that kind of thing. Or even just, I got to get something done tomorrow. Your mind is often in the future. Uh, and, and your goals and motives influenced how you see the present.

Speaker 3:          03:48          In other words, what's good for your goal? It's what's good for you. And you like and dislike things as a function of whether they're good for your current goal, which can be a disconnect from your longterm values and your longterm beliefs. And I'll show you some examples of that. So that's how it's organized and we'll jump right in, um, to the distant past of evolutionary past and these basic needs, uh, these, these very important, uh, needs that we have and motivations that we have. So basic to be safe, to survive, not to die, to avoid disease, to avoid germs, protect ourselves against disease. Uh, and of course, reproduction and mating, sex, uh, and cooperation. And these are, these are the basic ones, but they're, you know, they're the basic physical motivations that we have. And yet, as you'll see, they're influencing a lot more than that.

Speaker 3:          04:39          So for example, this is topical because this is October. It seems like every October we're told to get out, you know, go out and get a flu shot. There's this horrible new strain of flu virus out there. Uh, that's a killer and, and very dangerous. Can't read this very well. I'll tell you the, the study though, there's a metaphor is being used in our country and it's actually a metaphor that's been used in the past by arch conservative leaders in the past that is tapping into this very strong motivation that we have without realizing it. That immigrants into a country are like viruses into a body like germs into a physical body or bacteria into a body. And we need to protect ourselves and be safe from these germs and bacteria. We have to expel them and get rid of them if they're in our body already.

Speaker 3:          05:23          We have to build walls or build structures to keep them out, protect ourselves from the invasion of these germs and bacteria into our Bobby. And so if you think about, uh, uh, immigrant immigration that way, there's a, you can see there's a strong connection between the metaphor or analogy of immigration into a country and germs or bacteria or viruses into a body. Not said explicitly, although people, arch conservative leaders in the past have said that explicitly about despised minority groups in their society. Uh, and it, it was an excuse or justification for eradication of those groups. Well, what do we do this time of year? A few years ago, we reminded the people in our study of the flu virus and the threat of the flu. And then we had them complete a attitude survey about immigration attitudes towards immigration. After that, we asked them after they'd already completed that survey, whether they'd had a flu shot or not.

Speaker 3:          06:22          So the people who we raised this threat but already knew they had a flu shot, felt safe because here's the threat. But they've already taken steps to protect themselves against it. They should feel safe from the flu virus. It turns out they had more positive than average attitudes towards immigration because we raised the fruit, the flu threat. But for the people we raised the flu threat too, but had not had the flu shot. Their attitudes towards immigration became significantly more negative. They were more against immigration compared to a control group. So we're moving around their attitudes towards immigration by raising and lowering the threat of the flu virus, which is that connection I'm talking about. And there's more, there's a longstanding lot of research, uh, showing that, um, conservative, uh, uh, people with conservative ideologies are conservative attitudes are generally more concerned with physical threat and physical safety.

Speaker 3:          07:15          Then other people are a lot of research on that. For example, the size of the human, the Amygdala, which is the part of the brain that reacts to fear and, and strong emotions. It's actually larger and conservatives than in liberals. Brain imaging studies have shown that four year olds who are more fearful tend to have more conservative attitudes at age 23 as a study out of Berkeley. So there's lots of studies on this and in general, given this, there's been a easy trick that a political psychologist have used in the past that you can turn a liberal into a conservative basically by threatening them, making them feel afraid. They then have more conservative attitudes. And remember Franklin Delano Roosevelt saying, we have nothing to fear but fear itself. And former president Obama talks a lot these days about against the politics of fear because fear makes people more conservative.

Speaker 3:          08:08          Well, people have always turned, have been very successful at turning liberals and the conservatives, but no one has ever turn a conservative into a liberal. And so we did that by, as you probably could figure out how having him feel physically safe. We had them imagine that they were given a super power by a genie and they was a rich imagination exercise. And they really are trying to really imagine this happening in the control condition. The super power they were given was to be able to fly. That's actually the most popular superpower people want of all the ones that are possible. That's a control condition. The others were, uh, given the superpower of being invulnerable from FIS to physical harm, like superman bullets would bounce off you if you fell. Nothing would happen. Nothing would cut you. Those kinds of things. And they imagined that.

Speaker 3:          08:55          And then we looked at their attitudes on standard social issues that classically define and divide conservatives and liberals, like same sex marriage, marijuana, legalization and so forth. The ones that are the standard ones where you got the difference and you see on the left the flying condition, you get the standard difference. Conservatives are more conservative than liberal, but the fly thing didn't matter at all as a superpower, but the people who were made to feel and vulnerable to harm, the Conservatives move much more, much more close to liberal attitudes as a result of feeling physically safe temporarily. Another study on the actual defining quality of being conservative, which is resistance to social change. That's what the, that's what FDR was talking about in that speech about fear and fear itself was talking about the new deal that wasn't about World War II. That was 1933 his first state of the Union address during the depression on that issue, you actually cause conservatives in the roads to be identical.

Speaker 3:          09:52          If anything, then you've taken conservatives and turned them into liberals by at least temporarily making them feel totally physically safe. Just like you can take liberals, make them more conservative in their attitudes by making them feel afraid. So these deep underlying evolved needs bubble up to influence, you know, abstract social attitudes and political attitudes that you think are just the product of reasoning and some reason position. But you can raise or lower those conservative liberal attitudes on the top of the boiling water bite. Uh, the underlying flame underneath of feeling physically safe or feeling physically afraid.

Speaker 3:          10:26          Another one has been a lot of research on this one. Physical warmth and coldness over the last 10 years or so. We did a study 10 years ago in science published in science where essentially we gave everybody the same at uh, at Yale and other places, the same description of a person to read. And they formed an impression of whether they liked the person or not. We gave everybody the same one, but for some of them while they were coming into the experiment, actually in the, in the elevator coming up to lab, we had a lot of papers, like the question they were, they were supposed to fill out and we had in our hand, oh here we even have one, uh, a couple of either ice coffee or, or, or hot coffee, iced coffee or warm coffee. This is the ice coffee condition.

Speaker 4:          11:06          Okay.

Speaker 3:          11:07          We said, could you hold that for me for a second, you know, so I can get your papers for you. And they hold it and open it, throws the papers and he took it right back. So it was a matter of two or three seconds. They might've held but warm or the hot or the ice coffee. If they held a warm coffee, they formed a significantly more positive impression of the person they read about. If they had held the ice coffee significantly more negative impression of the person they read about number. Everybody read the about the same person. So feeling physically warm or cold actually changed it or feeling of a person being socially warm or socially cold. And since then, last 10 years, it's been a lot of neuroscience on this, mainly at Ucla where they show the same little part of the human insula, which is a walnut shaped part of the brain and the middle of the brain.

Speaker 3:          11:51          The same little part becomes when you hold something warm and when you're texting your family and friends and when you're thinking about the people close to you. And also the same little part becomes active when you hold something cold and when you're thinking about people who had betrayed you, who are, who are your enemies? They're connected, they're wired together. There's a channel between feeling physical warmth and feeling trust and, and the positive things towards other people. And the same kind of channel conversely with, with feeling of physically cold, get back to that in a second. Much more other research has been showing that a person's actual body temperature goes up and down along with their feelings of how closely feel to their family and friends. So people are in the hospital, their temperatures taken oral temperature every six, every hour for six hours. And they also asked them how closely feel to the close ones in their life. And it tracks their body temperature, raises and lowers when people are rejected in some way and a little game when people don't throw the ball to you anymore and some computer game, the avatars are tossing the ball around, but they stopped throwing it to you. You feel a little rejected. Your, your body temperature actually decreases about 0.4 Fahrenheit of a degree. You're actually feeling physical. Your body is actually physically colder after socially cold experience.

Speaker 3:          13:08          There was another kind of past, maybe even more opaque to us because the things that happened to us in the first three, four years of life, we don't have much memory for. A lot of things happened to us back then as as infants. This is my daughter who's a now 11, but when she was, uh, one, two, three years old, she was a huge fan of the movie cars and she loved lightning McQueen and she drove around the house, a little lightening cars that in a lightning chair had a lightning blanket. And we watched that movie together 50 or 60 times, at least 50 or 60 times. She was obsessed with lightening McQueen thought lightening, lightening McQueen live nearby in Durham, Connecticut cause she's a red corvette and you know, in that town, Nixon next door we lived. Well then she became five and a one night she wanted to watch a movie.

Speaker 3:          13:56          And I said, okay, Whoa, Whoa, why don't we watch cars? We haven't seen that for a while, several years, you know, and, and uh, that was, you know, you love that movie. It was your favorite movie. And she looked at me like I was nuts. Like, no, I've never heard of that movie. I'd never seen it before. And she really had no memory of ever seeing it before. And she's telling me this, sitting in that same lightning McQueen chair that she's never heard of this movie. And we watched it and she really was like, she was watching it for the first time. It was like a surprise at all. The plot twist. She was laughing at the right places. But as this, she'd never seen the movie before and she thought I was crazy cause I had said that she has just no memory at all of those years of her life.

Speaker 3:          14:33          Well, why is that important? Because there's a lot of things that do happen early in our life that do matter to the rest of our life and we have no idea that they're influencing us. And for one thing, a research out of Minnesota has tracked these people who are now in their twenties. But, uh, when they were one year old, they came into the lab with their mother and they, uh, took what's called the strange test. The strange test is a way to measure how it taps the child is to the, to the parent. And usually back in the day it was always the mother. But now it's both parents

Speaker 3:          15:04          and their kids, you know who are attached. Mother leaves the room and they're like not bothered because they know if there's any problem other we'll be right back. They can count on that mother has their back, but others they don't know that. And so when the mother leaves our are a mess, their cry there, there's sterically because they know the mother may not be coming back very soon or may not come in if they're yelling and crying for them. So they can't trust that. So it was a matter of bonding and trust. Is it there at age one or not? Then they look at these people age six, seven in elementary school, high school, then in their twenties, if they're securely attached to, they have more friends in grade school, they have, uh, they're happier and do better grades in high school and they have relationships that do not break up very often in their twenties. The opposite is true of the people who have insecure relationships at age one with their mother. So something is happening early in your life. It's affecting your relationships with people. Can you trust people? Do you break up with them easily or not the rest of your life? And they're tracking these people now they will continue to track them as they go through their life. But that's totally opaque to you because you have no memory of any of that.

Speaker 5:          16:07          Yeah.

Speaker 3:          16:08          There's things that happened in the present to go beyond what's really out there. Uh, for example, we really think we know people from their face. We really think that their faces, diagnostics, somehow we really know that person. No grumpy cat, right? It's a cat. It's a cat hats. Really Grumpy, right? I mean, it's not grumpy. It looks grumpy. You think it's grumpy now it's a cat. It's that really grumpy boy. It looks grumpy, right? And that's old man Marley from home alone. You know, probably before your time, but this is the 1990s movie, right? Old Man. Marlene was like an ax murderer and the base bodies in the basement next door according to the kids in the neighborhood, but turned out to be the sweet old guy. There's that scene at the end of the Christmas and he reunites with his granddaughter and it's all wonderful, but he's a sweet guy.

Speaker 3:          16:49          He is, looks like, you know, some ax murderer. But we really feel so sure of ourselves when we see a person's face. Like we really know the personality. Turns out that's not diagnostic. People are, uh, elected, uh, uh, as, as senators and governors who have the most trustworthy pace, people rate those faces not knowing who they are. And it turns out the one that was rated Morse trustworthy and competent tends to win these elections 70% of the time. So certainly the people voting are thinking, they know this person's competent are trustworthy, and the face by itself is not diagnostic. What is diagnostic is the person in action. If you see a person, even for 15 seconds, 30 seconds interacting with other people, that does predict very well. Um, their outcomes. Are they good therapists? Are they good teacher? Are they a good whatever, but not photographs? And not just seeing a person for the first time without any kind of interaction or seeing them in action at all.

Speaker 5:          17:42          Yeah.

Speaker 3:          17:42          Here's another way we go beyond that. We have

Speaker 3:          17:46          hurts of antelopes schools of fish, Fox of bird, all doing the same thing. Same time. You know, Fred bird is not looking around seeing Susie bird go one way and say, I think I'll do the same thing. It's not, it's not a matter of making decisions here. It's just an automatic kind of response to do the same thing as the conspecifics around you. Um, and cats, I'm not so sure. I mean, this needs to be replicated. Um, but we do, people do, people definitely do this. Little kids really imitate, especially around age two, age three, they're learning what it is right to do. They don't know. And so they're really watching everybody to see and they'll do what you're doing and they'll do it over and over and over again.

Speaker 2:          18:23          Okay.

Speaker 3:          18:24          So we studied this and show them that effecting the lab with college students, a physical behaviors like holding your ear, protecting your ear or, or shaking your foot, that kind of thing. You're more likely to do it when you're with a person doing the same thing and you've switched people and you do with, so it's like a chameleon changing the spots to match the environment, the social environment they're in. Okay. But this has consequences. This is a Dutch field study showing that anti social behavior, mild littering graffiti, uh, taking a shopping cart three blocks to your car instead of not leaving it in the parking lot. Those kinds of mild anti social behaviors are contagious in that in an area that has no graffiti, these leaflets that are put on the handlebars of the bike by rubber bands are not littered as much as they are on the right.

Speaker 3:          19:08          They put these on and if there's graffiti in that kind of thing, there's much more littering throwing them on the ground instead of throwing them away. Uh, and the various demonstrations, this paper came out in science about 10 years ago. Their social network analysis, uh, Nick Christakis and Jim Fowler, uh, looking at, uh, social networks like alumni associations or, or work groups, um, uh, credit union members, this kind of thing. And in that network, who knows who things like obesity, depression, cooperation, happiness and other things spread so that if there's a person, two or three people removed from you, but, and you don't even know them, but they know somebody you know, and that kind of thing, you're much more likely to have the same characteristics as they are. So things like that spread behavior spreads, mood spread, a behavior types like cooperation spread,

Speaker 2:          19:57          that's contagion.

Speaker 3:          19:59          The [inaudible] probably heard of this one, the, the Facebook study from 2014 we're 700,000 users have their newsfeed deliberately manipulate it as an experiment to be 20% more positive or 20% more negative than usual. And then they look to see that that user's own posts three up to three or four days later to see if they were also more positive or more negative. And they were so the manipulate the newsfeed, it actually caused the person themselves to have more positive or more negative mood in their posts.

Speaker 3:          20:30          That's another kind of, obviously social network could get this kind of spread. What you see is what you do. Uh, unfortunately is used by advertisers. This is a epidemiological study coming out of northeastern university, just published last year about 1000, uh, underage drinkers, 13 to 19 years. The more alcohol ads they watched on TV, the more they drank. You see these a lot, parents, uh, often, uh, watch NFL football games or other sporting events. You see beer ads, you see a captain Morgan, you see alcohol adds a lot. The more of these ads the kids were exposed to, the more of they drank. And this goes from an average of 10 drinks a month to 30 drinks a month for those who watched a lot of ads. This is a direct effect of the ad content. We've done studies just looking at five minute comedy clips, uh, the old, uh, show whose line is it anyway with drew Carey, we have a, a food add in there in the, in the break or a non food add in there.

Speaker 3:          21:22          In the break, we have a bowl of goldfish crackers next to him and the people who saw the food ad, it wasn't even about that kind of food. Eight 45% more of the goldfish crackers. The food ads are trying to get you to eat at home when you're watching TV so that you'll eat more than and have to buy more the next day at the store. They're trying to get you to consume more here. They're trying to get you to drink more or at least that is the outcome. Whether or not they are deliberately trying to do that. And the effect happens to teenage drinkers too. Nice thing about this mimicry is that it actually causes bonding, liking and a feeling of the interaction went more smoothly. Um, you know, we have these things where people do the same thing at the same time. And in our culture, religious rituals where you stand, you kneel, you sing hymns, you all do it at the same time.

Speaker 3:          22:05          Military, you w you march in step, you say things together in unison. This actually does produce greater bonding and liking for the group. And the group effort. These are fields studies. This is Dutch, a restaurant and the waitress, all the, all the waitress or waiter did in this study was to repeat back. The customer's order is right afterwards. So I like a hamburger, a milkshake and some fries. Uh, please. And then the waitress would say like a hamburger, milkshake and fries. Just repeat back the order or not. If she repeated back the order, the tips are on the right. They're significantly more tips at the end, uh, than otherwise. This is a French department store. Uh, uh, electronics department, part of the French department store, large French department store and MP, three players here. The same thing. They repeated back with the customer said when they, I'd like, uh, uh, look at an MP, three player for my grandson.

Speaker 3:          22:55          He's turning 13 next week. Oh, you're like an MP, three player for your grandson. He's turning 13 next week or not. Right. Or just, okay, here's the MP. Three players. Sales went from 63 to 87% in the a mimicry condition and customer satisfaction with the store. And the clerk was markedly higher. They went out to the parking lot and ask those kinds of questions afterwards. So real, real life consequences. Now the other thing about the president is the context changes. You, you can be a different person at home, uh, as, as a, as you are at work. Um, my, my, my sister was actually at the talk I gave in San Francisco the other day. Uh, and we're looking at a show like this is not our mother isn't who, yeah, it is. This is our mother. Um, so you can be a different person in different places.

Speaker 3:          23:43          Right? Well, Ernst Fehr, who's a professor of economics at the University of Zurich, has actually been tipped to win a Nobel prize in economics one day soon. You might hear his name again, has done studies looking at investment bankers. Big thing in Zurich, right? So investment bankers might be a different people at work than they are at home. What he did was to get them at home on a weekend and he had them play a coin toss game where every heads that they tossed, they'd get 20 Swiss francs. So I think there were 20 coin flips so you can win up to 400 if you get magically all, all 20 heads. You were the one who reported what you got, so no one would know you're at home. You can say you've got 20 if you know that no one would know the difference. Right. But you know by on average you're going to get 10 out of 20 heads on the average.

Speaker 3:          24:32          Uh, what he did in this study was to get them at home, but for some of them he had them describe their workplace with their office was like, so we got them thinking about their office right before this a game and the other condition, they did not do that. It's the same people randomly assigned to be the office or the home condition and you probably can't see this, but on the left, these are the home people. They were not asked to think about their office. And you get pretty much the binomial distribution, which means this is what you'd expect by chance. You get some people on the low end, you get some people on the high end. But most people are right there, you know, four or five or six in the middle or whatever it is. The, the, at the average, the people on the right are the people who thought about their workplace.

Speaker 3:          25:10          It's shifted significantly to the right. You can get this guy saying, oh yeah, you know, I got like all heads are, you know, again, you've got a lot of heads over there. Um, and you know, they're greedier, they're less moral, they're less honest. The same people randomly assigned if they just thought about their office in this mundane kind of way, uh, before the task. And he's talking about situated identities that you might be a different person at home, a different values and different behaviors than you are at, uh, at your workplace. Unfortunately, this hack, this actually affects kids. This is a study that at the time was shocking, came out of Harvard about 2004 or five Asian American girls. Uh, and, uh, they had them color in a color of a cartoon, uh, with crayons that either emphasize their Asian identity or they're female, they're girl identity with Asian themes or with, uh, girls playing with dolls.

Speaker 3:          26:08          Now the stereotype of the culture is Asian Americans are better at math and science then everybody else, uh, than the average person. But girls are not. Girls are worse at math and science then everybody else. So if they had colored in the Asian American of the Asian themes, the there, then they took a math test there, mat test was significantly higher than the average of the group. If they had just colored in the girl ones, their average was significantly lower than average of the group. Now remember, they're randomly assigned. These are the same kids randomly assigned to be in the Asian or the girl condition. The stereotypes of a culture about the qualities or the capabilities of groups has already gotten into their head at age five. Um, and influencing their actual performance on a math test. They are different person depending on which aspect of their identity has been made presently salient.

Speaker 3:          27:00          So the future to, to wrap up, um, the future, your goals change what you think are good or bad things, the health risks, you're willing to take, who you consider to be your best friends, uh, and so forth and so on. There's lots of stuff. I mean, for me, uh, you know, th th the feeling of the goal and the motive is strong when I'm playing these dumb game apps on my phone and I candy crush and I'm like trying to beat this level for weeks and I can't, I almost, I'm just almost there. And you know, the in APP purchase, right? These games are free, but the, in that purchase, right then that purse, oh, for union $5, you can get five extra moves like, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So you, you beat this level, Yay. And you move on. And then of course you get the bill.

Speaker 3:          27:43          You know, apple I do at every, you know, five 99 Dah. As I go, my God, it's like, well, we'll see the stupid game of Mifa. Who Cares? No one's going know is no trophy given out. And recognition of winning candy crush me, what am I? But at the time the goal is so close and you almost are there and the feeling is very strong if you really are into this game and are trying to beat all the levels, that kind of thing. So your goal changes what you think is as good or bad thing to do. Uh, in a more important way. Um, these are, uh, again, a Dutch grocery store reminded at the beginning if with a recipe flyer with words related to healthy eating or dieting and these are obese shoppers or not, it'd be shoppers. So now it'll be shoppers. This PR, these primes and the recipe fliers do not make any difference on their purchases.

Speaker 3:          28:27          But if the people who presumably more likely to have a a dieting goal and on eating healthy goal, these words and recipe fliers actually change how much unhealthy snack food they buy from B four and 20 euros to one and 80 euros. And they have no memory of the recipe flyer, what was in it and have any idea that that influenced, influenced them at all. What they did was activate the goal. They had four diet and healthy eating and actually change their, their purchases when they looked at the, uh, receipts at the end. Same thing. This is a university of Minnesota study, uh, with um, uh, undergraduate women who say they don't think diet pills and tanning salons were a good idea, the health risks and they're dangerous. Uh, but if they just looked in Tinder and other kinds of dating sites and were asked to rate the attractiveness of both men and women on the site activating, uh, like we want to call it a main goal or the idea of finding a mate and partner or sex, whatever you want to call it. Now they do these ratings and then suddenly they're fine with tanning salons and diet pills and don't think they're risky at all. It didn't think they'd hurt them at all. And so the same people are changed by the fact that they've got this goal being attractive as good for that goal. It may not be good for you and it may not reflect your chronic or long term values, but temporarily you think it's a good idea.

Speaker 3:          29:46          So what's changed you as I said, these things operate in the background. They can work on problems that you have and you maybe you've even forgot about, uh, what, what it was you're trying to remember something, you know, you know it but you can't remember it and you see here, try, try, try, uh, to remember it. And later on you're doing something completely different three or four hours later and the answer pops into your head out of the blue. But it was because unconsciously you were still trying to solve that problem in the background. You have a goal to solve it. You really want to solve it and you trying to figure out that answer and you get it later when you're thinking about something else. Sherlock Holmes did this all the time. I've read the, all the novels and the complete short stories over and over again.

Speaker 3:          30:26          When, when Sherlock Holmes comes to a, um, a impasse and can't make progress on some crime or something he's trying to solve, he takes a break. It plays the violin, he takes cocaine, you did something else and he comes back his pine trees freshed and he has insights and he has breakthroughs, right? He thinks he's, he's refreshed his mind. What's really going on is while he's, his conscious mind has been elsewhere, uh, unconscious processes continue to work on that problem and sometimes can do a better job than we can do consciously for reasons explained in the book, but reasons for unconscious kinds of processes being bettered, a processing information in parallel and better for complex decisions and complex problems sometimes and then more limited focus, uh, conscious thinking. Sometimes they come to you and when you're doing something else like Eureka in the, in the bathtub running naked, this is a g rated version, but he actually was naked according to historians at the time, ran naked through the streets of Syracuse after discovering the principle that he was working on in a public bath.

Speaker 3:          31:25          And there were, there have been dreams. The benzene ring, a ring theory calculate, came up with a benzene ring theory and a dream of snake eating each other's tails and a fiery kind of circle. Uh, I had my own alligator dream this described, uh, in the book, but it's the same kind of experience where it's just, you know, the answer. You've been working on something for five or 10 years and it comes to you in this kind of dream work, which is actually another way of this problem is being worked on, uh, when you're not actually consciously thinking about it. If it's a very important problem as it was to, um, both, uh, calculate and, uh, and myself. So people have worried about these things, uh, in terms of, um, mine control and, uh, whether you can use these kinds of influences on, on people to get them to do things that they maybe didn't want to do on their own. Um, and so, uh, you know, we do need to think about and talk about that because it is something that, um, that, uh, is it legitimate to worry about.

Speaker 3:          32:29          But just briefly and that's, that's where I'm going to wrap up. Um, you know, economist magazine, uh, worries about mind control, uh, has issues about that. In the past, there been books like communism hypnotism and the Beatles. This is actually a book that came out in 19 seven years old that the Beatles were trying to hypnotize us and make us communists through their evil beat. You can get these on Ebay aluminum foil, the Fucker beanies that prevent, uh, aliens from outer space, from sending rays that influenced your mind. Uh, and of course the sex and the ice cube stuff. There's still books on their subliminal seduction that had this kind of worry that that's what's going on in these kinds of ads. And this is actually a subliminal ad that was played on widely during the Bush Gore campaign in 2000. This is an actual ad from the Bush campaign that it was discovered actually subliminally put the word rats right before the word Democrats appeared in September of 2000 trying to emphasize the rats part of Democrats.

Speaker 3:          33:27          Uh, and they denied it. They meant to do this and this kind of stuff. And George W. Bush 43, uh, kept denying this for weeks afterwards saying they don't engage in this subliminal advertising over and over again, but they were. So, you know, those things you don't really have to worry about. These on the left are really true. They really are influencing us outside of our awareness and our influences that if we know about them, we can do something about them and we, we can actually use them to our advantage. We can turn them around and, and have them help us to, to get done what we want and help us do the right thing that we want to do and that kind of thing once we know all about them. But you know, some people are insisting that they're the captain of their soul and the captain of their ship and none of those things ever, you know, everything I influences me, I'm aware of an eye in town and nothing else really influences me.

Speaker 3:          34:11          But the really good ship captains are the ones who take the current and the wind into account. They don't just aim their ship at the port and say that's all that matters. The current and the wins don't matter at all because if they do that, this happens, you get crashed in the rocks are carried out to sea, you can play golf. That way you can aim right at the hole and fat for Goodwin doesn't matter and whatever. And this is what happens to you then. Uh, so you know, it's your choice. Everyone has the ability to make that choice on their own. But really the point is you actually do have, we all have control over these things because they're really not secret anymore. And once you know about them, you know, it's up to you what you want to do with them. But, uh, I want to thank you all for coming and I'm for listening today.

Speaker 2:          34:54          [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          34:58          how could we apply some of these techniques if I'm trying to lose weight, how can we apply some of these techniques to that? For example, so this is really recent stuff. The last five or six years, it's not my area, but I read the research and every a researcher now a five, six, seven of the major researchers in the area of self control and self regulation, right, are saying the people who are effective self regulators who score high on those scales, they people who are good self control, people on self regulators make more money than anybody. The rest of us, they are happier, they have a better relationships, they're healthier. All those good things. It comes with these who are high in this uh, ability to self regulate and self control. How did they do it? Well, the old model is acts of will they have such a strong will and the rest of us are just weak willed little wimps and we can't do the things they can do with her strong will.

Speaker 3:          35:49          It's actually the opposite of that. They don't use willpower. Willpower is hard to do and it's always a struggle. What they do is they set up their world to make it easy for them to do the things they wanna do. They set up their environment in a way that they don't have the tempting things that they could eat or drink at home. They don't bio's things in the first place. They set up the good things they want to do. They make good habits out of them and make routines out of them. They start by saying, okay, I want to exercise. I want to go running. They come home, they get out of their work clothes and they immediately put on their running shorts and running shoes because what else are you going to do after you put on your running shoes and you're running stuff but go run and they make that so that they do it without even thinking.

Speaker 3:          36:25          They come home, they change, they put that on and without having to use any willpower at all. So the effective self control and self regulator, people are making use of the unconscious kinds of influences of habit and routine and setting up their world. If they want to be a kinder and helpful, they'll put up a photograph of the people they want to be kind and help to in their life. Like their grandmother. They always are kind and helpful to their grandmother if they might have a picture of her on their desk as a reminder without thinking about it to be that way or whatever it is, you know, high achievement, whatever it is. You make your world to have those cues come in from the outside that trigger these tendencies that you want to support and build your, your world so that the outside world supports it instead of terrorists, those things down and that's what they do.

Speaker 3:          37:10          So that that would apply to a losing weight. It would apply to exercising. It would apply to pretty much anything you want to do. Thanks for the talk. So shallow, shallow or final goal. Be really too on [inaudible] and decipher unconsciousness as much as we can so that you can cope with unconsciousness better. Or is there some level in which having some level of unconsciousness, it's actually a healthy thing and you should just let let it be Indian? Yeah. This is the hardest chapter of this book to write for me was a chapter called when can you trust your gut? Because in the past we've had books like blink, right? Best sellers that say trust your gut and other books like thinking fast and slow, they say don't trust your gut and they're both sitting there and paper back in the storage right next to each other, right?

Speaker 3:          37:53          They say the opposite thing. So it's a little more nuanced than that. It's a little more difficult question than that. Uh, you pretty much can trust your gut and you can trust unconscious influences, uh, in, in certain situations and not in others. Uh, one rule is if it's your preference and kinds of things you like or dislike, your first kind of reactions usually are the best. And you can overthink your, your feelings and get something different because of that and not be as happy with that choice. If you overthink it, you can trust your gut about other people that you're meeting as long as you see them in action. If you see that just the face or you know their characteristics like skin color or age and so forth, then you can be very wrong. But if you see them in action, usually we're pretty good about that.

Speaker 3:          38:33          So I, the one thing that the rule for other people is to always give people a chance. Don't judge them just on what the way they look or what you think. Cause it's very powerful. Studies in, in courtrooms, for example, have found that baby faced individuals have more of a childlike face, get lower sentences or less likely to be found guilty for the same crimes as people who aren't baby faced. And unfortunately, people of color, the darker the color, the longer the sentence they get for the same crime. And this is going on right now. This isn't something in the past. So these things really matter to real outcomes. And unfortunately people like judges and people in legal system deny this stuff happens. They don't know that that's not an influence. I just tell my jury not to, not to be influenced by those things.

Speaker 3:          39:15          Really. That's what, that's what actual trial judges say to people who point out this kind of evidence. So they just said, you know, so when can you trust unconscious? I'll tell you one thing. Uh, I heard from somebody. Um, uh, well anyway, other people say the same kind of thing. I was on the channel five a morning show this morning and somebody in the audience said the same thing that I'm going to say now. Um, I would give myself assignments. Basically when I'd finished, I broke this book basically last year in six months. I wouldn't try to ride it for four years, but it finally clicked and I finally was able, amazing day one, almost a chapter a week and it just was coming out of me and what was going on after I'd finished a chapter. You Think, oh good, I finished a chapter, you know, relax, have fun for a while and then start the next one tomorrow.

Speaker 3:          39:58          But before I would do that, I always get the next chapter in my head. I'd always take the next day stuff and start looking at it and get it all up here and then go have fun and then go relax, be with my daughter, you know, go shopping, do the chores, whatever I needed to do. But I'd always get the next thing in my head first. So it would be, I'd be working on it without, you know, unconsciously basically. And boy was, it was great. You come back the next day and I'd have ideas about how to organize and put it all together and get going right away. Much better than if you leave it and start cold the next morning. So those are the things you kind of use. One other thing I just, this is my favorite little tip like life hat kind of thing out of this is this thing about bonding and imitation.

Speaker 3:          40:35          You can use that. It's so easy because we naturally imitate and mimic each other without trying to, you don't want to try to, all you need to do is look at the other person. So if you're meeting somebody in new colleague and new work, somebody, a new neighbor just moved in, you know, a new friend, you know, anything like that. Just look at them while you were interacting for the first time. You will naturally because you're just looking at them, imitate what they do that will naturally cause them to bond and like with you more than if you hadn't done that. And the, the, the, the, the tech, the trick is just to look at them and turns out that on, on empathy scales, people who have a personality is higher empathic than other people. They also are the people who look more and perceive more at the other person while they're interacting. And it's a real easy thing to do and it has all these potentially good benefits and you're just letting this sort of unconscious mechanism operate on its own naturally. When you say that things like cooperation and obesity

Speaker 6:          41:34          can have effects two or three degrees from your social network, how do you know what's cause and what's effect? They're like, how do you know it's not the case? Dad say obese people tend to be more friends with each other than otherwise.

Speaker 3:          41:49          Oh, you can't. These are correlational studies that the social network analysis and sociology is correlational. Uh, the Facebook study was, was a actual experimental because they manipulated the news feed and showed, but even the earlier Facebook study showing a contagion were correlational. That's why Kramer did this second study. The first one showed the contagion, but say, well, you know, the, the objection was just what you said and then say, okay, you experimentally manipulate it. It was very controversial because you know, you're playing around with people's Moods, right? And it's the end of the user, the end of the agreement, what do you call those things? It's like on page 5,004 that year it was okay to do that and no one ever reads those, right? So, uh, they said it was okay because of the people using Facebook agreed to this because it's in the agreement. Um, but then they did the experimental version and showed the same effect. So you're absolutely right in the sociological, a social network. The reason I put that up there, it's a, it's a, it's a new method that shows it actually happening. It does not give a conclusive answer about the cause. The other studies like ours, when we manipulate what people do and show the same effect that, that, that helps, uh, make you feel better about the causal nature of it. You have to do both though. You have to do both kinds of studies

Speaker 7:          43:00          says the mimicry, why everyone likes parents as a, as a pet bird. I got a good pair of joke at my, uh, my real question is that, so at Google we have a, well, we have a lot of training programs around trying to tackle unconscious biases and uh, in fact in the promotion committee processes we have, everyone's required to go through the unconscious bias training prior to actually serving on a promotion committee. I was just wondering, um, in the broader, um, uh, industry with, through uh, in other corporations, other, um, other organizations settings, have you looked into research around a unconscious bias training and trying to steer the effects of these, uh, biases have them,

Speaker 3:          43:49          that is a cottage industry that's outside of academia basically. I remember there was a, I look at Tumblr sometimes and I may have a little dumb, you know, nature picture thing on tumbler with three followers. And since I'm on there like a few Fridays ago, maybe three or four Fridays ago, it was an open question and answer on unconscious bias. And those people who are answering the questions, I don't know any of them and I haven't heard, but they're all in the private sector or the, they're an industry. Uh, so I don't really know what the kind of training, I know that they do talk about the Harvard implicit IAT kinds of tests that you can take to detect the fact that you might have some unconscious bias. Um, it's a little, uh, it's a, it's a much simpler version than what I'm talking about in the book because the unconscious bias they measure is just good or bad.

Speaker 3:          44:29          It's just you have a, or a negative association with these groups and that that can be mis attributed. So the idea of this is, this would fall into the present section of the book, that you have a negative feeling towards a member of a different social group and that negative feeling, you don't know the real source of it because it says unconscious kind of source. And then you use the attributed to something that makes plausible sense. Oh, they didn't have such good letters of recommendation or they didn't come from a very good school or you know, you somehow explain it in some, in terms of something that may be plausible. So that's a real danger is that even well, meaning well intentioned people, Egalitarian people fall prey to this misattribution effect because they have the negative feeling not knowing what the source is and then apply it to something that is plausible that they can say, oh, I didn't like this or that.

Speaker 3:          45:14          And makes you know, sense it's not, their skin color is not their gender, you know? But there's so many demonstrations. I mean, in the book, talk about this new Italian study, which is horrible. This is a 11,000 job applications, actual jobs postings in Italy. And what they did was they made up a, an identical set of resumes, identical, uh, qualifications, education. Everything is identical. They either made it a male or a female applicant by the name, and they put either an attractive or an unattractive photograph along with the application. And they sent all four to all the 11,000 jobs in Italy. And these were actual jobs they wanted to see who got called back for an interview among the women, 57% of the attractive woman got called in for an interview. 7% of the unattractive women got called in for an interview. Now you may say, well, they're just intentionally trying to hire the attractive women and you talk to the people and no, that's not what we're trying to do.

Speaker 3:          46:08          And that would be illegal. They don't want to do that. They say they don't. And yet they have this bias called the beauty premium. That's huge. I mean, 57 to 70 for men, it's 47 to 25. I mean, it's bad for men too, but for women, it's gigantic. And these are people who are not given the same economic opportunities because of these kinds of biases. So in real life right now, you know, not back in the past, these things really are a problem. Uh, and they have to do with biases that people aren't aware of. But now we should know more about these biases. And we should be able to take steps to stop them. You know, like not having photographs on applications for one thing. Right? And I know an orchestra's, uh, the tryouts are behind a curtain. You don't know the age, you don't know the gender, you don't know the race, the ethnicity, whatever you want to call it, of the person behind the curtain.

Speaker 3:          46:55          You can only hear the music. If we could do that. And that's easy to do for orchestras, right? It's not yet easy to do in other areas, but removing those kinds of cues that the culture gives us, it says this group can do this, this group can't do that. You know, we get from the culture and soaks into all of us. Even if we are well meaning and well intentioned and egalitarian people, it's still in our heads. We'd get rid of those cues. We'd be a lot better off. We can do a lot more now. I don't know if that's what they do. See, I don't know the training and, and what they're about. But that would be my answer or my solution or, but I would suggest based on the research now what we

Speaker 7:          47:29          do here is, uh, it, it depends on if you're taking the online version of the training or if you're doing the, um, the, the in person training sessions. But the in person training sessions tried to really focus on, um, trying to incite these biases, trigger these biases that someone might not realize that they have and say, then you can reflect on, on having, on realizing that you had that bias that you didn't

Speaker 3:          47:52          it because I, I have so strongly, I mean, this is why I went into my field partly, and I teach this about Yale undergraduates and everything. And I do get some students walking out of the room talking about these kinds of things about privilege and stuff like that. Uh, but here's what I would say, because I've got your right now and I'm gonna say this, the last chapter of the book, and I'll give it to you for free right now. What I'm saying. It's not my own research, but just a way to combat these things that actually works. They're called implementation intentions and not my race. My colleague Peter Goldwood Cert Nyu. The idea is this, when I see a person of color, I will be fair and what you're doing is you're specifying the trigger out there that will cause the idea of fairness immediately to happen.

Speaker 3:          48:32          You, you link your intention to the, into the future state of affairs. When I see a person of color, which is going to happen, I will be fair and you, you really have to commit yourself to that. It's not a magic trick that if you don't really, I don't really care about, I'll say it. You know, magic magic. It's not a, it's not a magic spell. You have to be really committed in the first place, but you want to do that. You can say that and actually it works and that works for lots of things. You know, when x happens in a reliable future event, that always happens. I will do y when x happens, I will do y and that kind of thing helps. The elderly, take medications when they got five different kinds of pills at different times of day with food or without food.

Speaker 3:          49:09          All this kind of complicated stuff. It helps them do that. It helps health psychology is we use this political, uh, people have used this to increase voter turnout in primary elections because they say at 10 o'clock on Tuesday morning, I will take a break from work, I will drive to the polling place. And I, you specify the when, where and how of you're going to take a carry out your intention instead of I'm just going to vote. You make a concrete plan when, where, and how I'm going to do it. And that really helps. So if there can be a, when the feisty of encounter a person of color, I will be fair, that simple kind of thing. And they've actually done studies showing that actually does make people more fair and treatment. So maybe that'll work.

Speaker 8:          49:47          So I've been told, I have the honor of asking the last question. And My, uh, so you, earlier you mentioned the experiment where if people were exposed to warm a warm environment, there were more prone to social warm and if they were exposed to colder than the opposite, uh, do you know if that is a function of people using the exact same word, warm to refer to these two very different things or versus like social warmth then acts, physical warmth as, so, thank you for asking. Asking

Speaker 3:          50:13          that. Uh, it's the reason why we use the word warm for both and there's lots of George Lake off right at Berkeley has written all about metaphors we live by and all these different metaphors. We tend to appropriate a physical language terms to talk about our relationship with people. It's almost like there's no psychology separate language. It's all physical. So we talk about a distant father or a close relationship or high status.

Speaker 3:          50:38          These are all physical direction, you know, uh, kinds of terms. A warm friend, a cold friend, a cold boss, you know, something like that. So why are we using all these physical terms? Because it turns out these are researchers who look at child language development. It turns out these are the first experiences that children have and their direct experiences. They're the first concept infants forum and kids, toddlers, former, these warm called high, low, you know, close and far kinds of terms, rough, smooth, and so our then we develop understandings of people. We tend to use that vocabulary and so we talk about a hard negotiator or soft on crime.

Speaker 2:          51:19          Okay.

Speaker 3:          51:20          Which means when we're yielding, you know, it's the physical term all the time and we just, we all know what each other means to, we can communicate using these terms. The thing about the warm, I just want to say no, how many of you are parents are going to be parents, but this channel of warmth, a physical warm signaling to the infant that you can trust that the infant can trust. Whoever they're with is gigantic. It's, it's, it's been there since time in memorial and it's a way that, you know, now my wife used to work in a hospital. They say, she says now that they have the father opened the shirt and put the baby on on the fathers, just not just the mother breastfeeding because I want the father to also bond with the child and they say this is the skin on skin contact, Eh, eh, it may not be the skin on skin as much as the warmth because to the baby who doesn't know anything, the feeling of warmth is an ancient of sign that you can be trusted and is this channel that works all the way through our life.

Speaker 3:          52:13          It's still there as adults, but it's hugely important for the infant who doesn't know who to trust is totally helpless, is dependent on everybody around them to keep them fed and warm and, and uh, have something to drink and shelter protected from predators. And it's that channel. So I knew this going in with my daughter. I hugged and hugged and hugged and hugged and hugged to make sure she was as securely attached by age one at least as possible. I was basically a single parent raising this little girl and knowing that it would affect her the rest of her life, it would affect her friendships and great school. How long her relationships lasted in her twenties and if I could just invest, even though it's so exhausting, you know, with little, little, little babies and toddlers is invest as much as my time to do that for her. Early on, it would pay off her her forever and we can all do that. But that channel is there and it can be used. It seems irrational. It seems silly. Why would warm, you know, but the little, no, nothing baby. It matters. It matters everything. Thank you very much. Thanks for the question.
