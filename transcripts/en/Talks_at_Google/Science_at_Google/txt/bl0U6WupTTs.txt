Speaker 1:          00:05          Right.

Speaker 2:          00:06          I'm pleased to welcome Leonard David to our toxic Google program today. Lennar David is an award winning space journalist who has been reporting on space activities for over 50 years. He frequently contribute to the website space.com as their space inside columnist and as the coauthor of Buzz Aldrin Mission to Mars in 2015 he became the first recipient of the American astronautical societies Ordway award for sustained excellence and space flight history and the category of journalism. And in 2010 he received the National Space Club press award. Mars. Our Future on the Red Planet considers the eminent settlement of humans on Mars backed by extensive research. The book says the book is part of a Major National Geographic Mars initiative this fall, including the documentary in partnership with Ron Howard. Please join me in welcoming Lennar David to Google today.

Speaker 3:          01:03          Right.

Speaker 1:          01:06          Well thanks so much for coming in on your lunch break to, there will be pictures of tomatoes grown on Mars, so I help you who, who doesn't have lunch will be more hunger hungry. Uh, I thought I'd start out with something. I went to a book review from somebody else and they were clever and reading in their own words, you know, cause you write these and it's pretty that first paragraph, you know, when you get the assignment to do one of these books, that first one is a killer. And in the 2030s, a peculiar shadows slips across the Reddish Vista. That is Mars. The historic arrival of the first expeditionary crew from Earth to the Red Planet, balances on an impulsive mix of rocket propulsion, determine will and hard earned luck, outstretch landing legs of the craft near the planet. A powered and safe descent by humans onto Mars is a literal trial by fire.

Speaker 1:          02:09          So I got done with that and played piano for a couple of hours and let me take you on this trip. I'm not going to be easy. I think what I'm trying to get across, it's going to be difficult and we liked challenges and this is full of those challenges. Um, I think one of the things that I'm proud about this book is I tried to integrate not just technical aspects. I didn't want to shove a bunch of people and habitats and give him a porthole the lookout in a space suit and run around out there and plant a flag salute, grab rocks, come back home. That's not what this is about. And this is a kind of a really important time frame and exploration of space. Um, the book is sort of divided into these chapters.

Speaker 4:          03:05          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          03:06          And this is a concept. I, I went through a lot of editors and I, I tried Mars land. When I got done with this book, I kept thinking people kept sending me emails. Every picture they've seen from Mars that looks like someplace we been, either it's Utah, southwest, maybe Iceland's, some people have been in Iceland. Um, it's a mixture of all that. And I felt there was Myers land that I wanted to project in this book. And when I got the call to write this book, I was actually at a meeting at the Lunar Planetary Institute and Houston, Texas. They brought in hundreds of scientists to start looking at potential landing zones for humans. The first meeting of this type and about 50 different sites. On Mars became explorations zones. I'll explain a little bit more about what that is, but these are the early preliminary, uh, sites that had been selected as potential areas where a habitats can be first put down on Mars.

Speaker 4:          04:14          Okay.

Speaker 1:          04:14          The key to this is exploration zones. What does it mean? It means that the humans can go to different places within a certain, uh, say a hundred mile circle and find all kinds of either resources, scientific benefit to go there. Um, and also problems, you know, cause there's going to be really a lot of mystery with Mars as much as we think we know about it. My guess is we got some Aha moments coming. Um, you're sort of the artist's concepts of first foot fall on Mars. You know, what kind of crew makeup will that be? How many will be there? Six or seven. Somebody is a laggard and they're waiting for him to, or she didn't get out of there. I be the commander. They can, sure. They don't fall through the, the dust or anything.

Speaker 4:          05:08          Okay.

Speaker 1:          05:08          Um, one of the things about this particular assignment for me doing the book was it's part of a, on a companion book to a six part series that national geographic has just on the edge of releasing. The first one shows up on TV on National Geographic Channel on November 14th. Uh, it's a docu drama and it has a crew and you'll think be very much entertained and, uh, excited and also a nervous about what happens on this, this particular expedition and has some surprise endings. Uh, but it, it reflects a lot of what the book tries to get to, which is a global vision. How many countries are really going to go to Mars? You'd be surprised how many countries have already gone to Mars through robotic means. Right now, India has an orbit around Mars. Uh, Europe has a new webinar that just started, uh, operations, uh, that Nasa us have several.

Speaker 1:          06:12          Uh, China is going to be launching a, a rover to Mars in 2020. Uh, other countries have definitely picked up the pace about the exploration of Mars. So I did write a lot of our global vision. Um, again, the Indians, uh, Chinese right now as we speak, we've got to Chinese astronauts up in their space lab. Um, you know, to me in my, my little world of space journalism, uh, China's the story to watch. They're very aggressive and it's going to be very fascinating to watch them grow in the next few years. Lots of components of the Chinese space program coming together pretty quickly. European Space Agency is a key player. Uh, in the book I try to get to something that's a bifurcation of exploration objectives and goals. One of them is the Europeans are very interested in creating a moon village. They're trying to bring together all the countries that are a part of the European Space Agency and perhaps put a, uh, a mini settlement on, on the moon.

Speaker 1:          07:21          And there was a lot of this debate discussion should be go to the moon, back to the moon first. Should we use the moon for fuel somehow to make the Mars mission happen? Um, I'm not going to go into all the details of it, but it's pretty well laid out in the book. It has definitely, uh, uh, a discussion point coming up about where other countries may go in the next decade or so. Also, this is a picture that just happened a few days ago where the Europeans, a crashed landed there, a lander and nobody was on this. This is a robotic craft, but this is, gets to the point that everybody says that all the engineers, and I know a lot of you are engineers, Myers is hard and you know, it's really hard when you slam into it at 200 miles an hour.

Speaker 1:          08:12          But they lost this arbitrary. And just even today, this morning, one of the, one of the orbiters around Mars has actually got some new images in a definitely a splattered software failure apparently. And a story I can't write yet, but I think it's there. I tar problems. You know, people in the United States have problems even talking about a Europe, about software, how many Ihr people are here? Is there anybody who really gets into the ITR? I think this is what's going to come out of this story. Um, on a wildcard in all this is Elon Musk. I mean, he's got this space, acts, Tesla, solar cities in Mexico a few, several weeks ago now. He unleashed his vision of where he believes Mars exploration is going to go. He's got an interplanetary transport system he wants to build. He definitely is. Um, I'm getting old. I'm about 70. To me, he was like the Walt Disney, a guy up there because when I was watching tomorrow land on black and white TV and the 50s, while Disney, you used to come out and parade out his visions with Vern avant Braun and some of these other people about space travel on Mars was the objective.

Speaker 1:          09:30          And so I, I felt like Alon touch my nerve again because I remember Walt Disney.

Speaker 4:          09:38          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          09:38          This is one of his concepts.

Speaker 4:          09:44          Okay.

Speaker 1:          09:44          The thing to watch with Alon is the use of the dragon capsule that is now in use, uh, for uh, hauling up cargo and eventually humans to the international space station. So a line's got a pretty gutsy plan about trying to land these robotic, uh, craft this red dragon on Mars. The key to this is you see all that stuff coming down. It's called supersonic retropropulsion. And it's like the old days in science fiction. I mean, we, that's the way we used to do it. And Psi Phi, you don't need the big parachute. He can just land and, um, alon is already done. And as a space x rocket, you know, those drone ships he has out in the water and then he's got land a land, he lands on land. Those are going to supersonic retropropulsion maneuvers. NASA is very interested in this technology for getting larger and larger and larger payloads on Mars. So Alon is already a cutting metal on a lot of good ideas. Uh, the other thing in the book, we got into his home base. Um, I was surprised how many analog sites around the planet, people are going into little habitats. This is in Hawaii practicing Mars missions. You see them all over the place. There's, um, these are the, the Mars want to be astronauts, but, but what they're learning things that are thinking very practical. One of them is this, the sociological implications of five or six people, uh, sharing food and wondering who stole the m and m's. Uh,

Speaker 1:          11:34          uh, the one aspect that I did highlight in the book is that we're going to start pretty small. Uh, these logistics flights to Mars. You get a small lander, uh, with, uh, um, these habitats kind of structured this way, kind of small. Um, but that's the beginning and this is, this is all doable in my mind. And, and we've already got robotic craft on Mars that weigh a ton now, but we got to learn how to get bigger and bigger payloads down on the surface. You know, here's another expansion idea for habitats.

Speaker 4:          12:13          Okay.

Speaker 1:          12:13          Uh, one big, uh, discussions coming up is should we stay in Mars' orbit and you as teller robotics to actually glue the habitats together before astronauts humans get there. Um, it's an interesting development and telepresence and tell a robotics and that's moving along in a separate wavelength. And we'll see. I think it's going to be a major player no matter what. But there is a lot of discussion about having an orbiter with people in it around Mars actually assemble, uh, the site that eventually humans will go to before they get there. So the raw robots will be sort of be waving to the astronauts as they climb off. So we'll have a pretty good review ahead of time through robotic eyes are what the habitat looks like, uh, before even humans set foot on Mars. Here's tomato pictures. So those are you still hungry? This is a big issue. You know, we are beyond Tang. It's the 21st century. So uh, things are happening in some, uh, biology labs and how a bad crop growth. Uh, how much, uh, came over your lie on crops grown on Mars. How do we grow, what happens to them? Um, what nutrients are needed. Again, this is short about a conceptual module with the whole greenhouse jammed in there. I got a feeling people are going to be on Mars, are going to be very thin.

Speaker 1:          13:47          I wish I was there some days. But anyway, one of the best thing is it's going on now. Some very creative three d printing construction concepts and this is where it's going to go this way. We're not going to have tin cans with people hunker down in there. I think we're going to start using the local resources of Mars to actually use construction, uh, materials and actually build new kind of structures on Mars. Uh, that makes it nicer. There's living rooms, there's, you know, all kinds of, there's a TV room over to the right side maybe, but also Mars has got a lot of water and a lot of ice under the surface. And one other, the new architectural concepts is this ice, um, ice house on bars. So who's to say, all I know is people are really looking at right now that's from inside the ice house.

Speaker 4:          14:44          Okay.

Speaker 1:          14:44          Also caves on Mars. We're looking for caves. Should we go back to cave living? That wasn't it. I didn't get down to that, but that's, that's a circle there for a writer. It's kind of fun to think about it. We came out of the cave and we're going back into the caves and Mars. But the, uh, the idea here is that you're much more protected in these caves from ultra violets and, uh, and uh, my guess is mission control would have a hard time letting people go and caves. But we'll see. Um, they're definitely there on Mars. So how are we going to use them? Uh, a big issue is mobility on Mars. I mean, once you've got your explorations zone started, what kind of equipment are really going to have to use to move around and get to places on Mars? And how much time are they going to have outside?

Speaker 1:          15:36          Uh, how far should they go away from the habitat in case the, the, uh, rover kind of breaks down and the people got to trudge back to the habitat for safety. Uh, these are all early things that the Apollo program ran into as well because they didn't let the astronauts drive off into the sunset and then have a, a wheel fall off and tried to get back to the lunar module. So there's some operational problems here about mobility on Mars. One way around that is having, uh, the astronauts have the ability to actually launch balloons.

Speaker 4:          16:14          Okay.

Speaker 1:          16:14          Make use of little robot hoppers. There's this design of a Mars airplane, kind of a remote pilot vehicle from ours and all controlled by the people on Mars so they can extend that zone a of exploration. So I, that's the other shoe that's going to dropping now is how are we going to get the blending of humans and the robotic tools they need to really do an investigative, uh, multi expeditionary look at Mars tumbleweed using the winds of Mars instrumented tumbleweeds science payloads. Some of these could be unleashed across the polar caps.

Speaker 4:          17:03          Okay.

Speaker 1:          17:03          But then, okay, we get past the kind of cool technical thing. You start talking to someone, a psychologist and some of the people who have done reports on submarines and Antarctic and in any of the polar bases and you start seeing some trouble signs here. Um, here's a trouble sign. These guys went on strike in Skylab. Uh, there was a moment there. They had so much coming in from mission control. They said, we're outta here. We're cutting off calm. We're going to enjoy this. You got that. You got too much, uh, operational paperwork. We got to go through. And they s there was an actual strike by astronauts on board the sky lab so they had some time to fool around.

Speaker 4:          17:59          Okay.

Speaker 1:          17:59          Uh, the thing that's happening now is the, certainly the international space station and the key thing, it's international, you know, multiple, multiple countries have participated in this huge engineering feat. Um, early on we all thought, well, you know, is this the white elephant and space I was, I'm probably guilty like everybody, why, how much money is this thing going to cost? Uh, it's turning out to be what promise to be, which is a test bed for a lot of hardware, a lot of ideas and also understand the physiological, sociological, cultural impacts that happen in micro gravity. And it is becoming a testbed for moving on to Mars. We're getting a lot of interesting, provocative signals out of the space station program. Just a kind of a beauty shot of the earth and the person.

Speaker 4:          18:50          Okay.

Speaker 1:          18:50          They have, I keep talking to the astronauts. This is the, this is a calm moment because a lot of I'm trying to cram in there and it's hard to see out the window when he got six or seven heads in there haircuts in space. That's a big issue.

Speaker 4:          19:09          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          19:09          Again, what are we learning about, you know, life far away, even though it's only 300 miles up.

Speaker 4:          19:18          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          19:20          Music is a big thing. That's another big issue of trying to be responsive to your own timeframe and you can have fun. Uh, I've seen some pretty interesting sports that have shown up with m and m's again and, and they, they take duct tape and make balls out of him and try to lob it between the modules and see who hits a target. So I think just again, it's going to be an early signature of what Mars exploration. We'll be alive with people having to have downtime and not be so under pressure.

Speaker 4:          19:54          Okay.

Speaker 1:          19:54          A very interesting experiment. Just a, um, a while back with mark and Scott Kelly. There were twins. Um, here's, he, he stayed up on the space station for a year and his brother went through all these medical tasks and as a control, a person for a, for a whole new look at what happens to genetics and space. And, uh, uh, he came up with all kinds of interesting comments about his, his trip. And, uh, I, I, NASA hasn't even put it all together yet, but there's definitely a, some, again, a lot of really positive things and some things we got to watch. But that was a year long mission, uh, by Scott Kelly and, uh, came back on a saw, use a capsule and landed in Russia. And, uh, obviously the biggest question mark and, uh, in exploration of Mars is, you know, whereas the life is that there and if it's there, should we be worried about us contaminating it or it contaminate us? We don't know. And, uh, we see things, evidence of surface water. These are probably the worst kind of name you could ever give. Something that's kind of exciting. These are called recurring slope linear. Yay. This is, I go to conferences and I the recurring slope, NEA, that paper we found new ones.

Speaker 1:          21:29          Okay. Um, there's something happening, seeping of water. There was some speculation that some of these things are fed by huge aquifers underneath the surface. My guess is that's probably true. Um, and where there's water is their life. So Mars still is hauntingly

Speaker 4:          21:52          okay.

Speaker 1:          21:52          Touching her nerves about finding life on Mars. And is it a second genesis of life? Is it, is it life that somehow came from earth and landed on Mars or vice versa? One of the things that people talk about and I wrote about in the book is, is it possible that Mars, uh, had microbial life really early in the formation of the planets and it was impacted in microbial life on Mars came to Earth. So we are the marshes and the irony is that we're going to go back the home planet.

Speaker 4:          22:30          Okay.

Speaker 1:          22:31          Um, the life question is one that is a, also an ethical ones and I've spent a lot of time and energy on that. And one of the chapters about terraforming Mars, can we make an earth to, you know, are there ways that we can transform Mars and make it more suitable to you? Human kind. Uh, Tara farming, we do it all the time here in the book. We talk about global climate change. That's terraforming. We just don't have the levers right to control it. And we are trying to make certain rules and regulations to control climate change. But can you bring that to that planet and alter it, particularly when our life force has been on that planet and as, as hunkered down there and then what happens, uh, to the life on that planet. So we, what is the ethical boundaries of exploration and using Mars to kind of do the Mars makeover.

Speaker 4:          23:30          Okay.

Speaker 1:          23:31          The best thing is going on for people in the morning. You get up for a rye imagery coming from Mars is actual pictures from curiosity. Landed on Mars in August of 2012. Uh, it's a one ton nuclear powered rover, still cranking. Does great work. Very slow from August, 2012 to just a few days ago. It has driven I nine miles, nine miles. Okay. You get some geologists down there and they're going to kick that thing out of the way and keep going, you know, so, um, it's a slow process, but you got to multibillion dollar kind of investment. You gotta be careful about how you run it. And it's, it's really a very fascinating piece of hardware. A, these are the kinds of real, this is real imagery from curiosity rover. This is the kind of things that sees. And every morning I get up and look at the next set of raw imagery and it's pretty, it really is cool. How many people think you've been there? I mean, is it, is, does it look familiar? Am I wrong? I had been somewhere like that and I've seen that,

Speaker 4:          24:53          okay,

Speaker 1:          24:53          this is a danger. This is one of those I could see me walking by and that thing falling in on me. Um, so that's, and that is one of the points of the book. There's some danger here. This is not going to be a slam dunk kind of mission. And, um, so we've gotta be very careful how we pulled this off the giant leap. Um, one of the things, again, I'm trying to pull together, when you go back and look at exploration on the earth, we've really, you can go anywhere. You can go into the top of mountains, you can go under sea, you can go to deserts, you can go to Arctic regions. Um, you can do all that. And one of the things that always happen as a humans create the technology that the suits, the whatever, you know, to conquer whatever environment they're in. And it's the same way with Mars. We got new kinds of suits people are looking at. Uh, the key with this issue is a mobility on the planet. These people can't just, you know, kind of, um, just walk around, they're going to have to do a lot of work and if something breaks down, they're going to have to repair. So there all kinds of new mobility devices on suits to give them more flexibility. Um, this is the biggest element.

Speaker 4:          26:15          Okay.

Speaker 1:          26:16          I don't know where all this is going to go. I all I know is that people are working very, very hard about getting people to Mars. And it's not just the U S it's multiple countries. Uh, the political will and leadership of any nation that undertakes this kind of event. Uh, even if it's a global event, there has to be some kind of leadership role to sort of coordinate everything. A bomb has been interesting. He's made some talks just about going to Mars. We're going, uh, then we have an administration change and I, I'm getting old, but I lived in Washington DC for 30 years and every time one of these people get in, they look at NASA and I shift things around and try to, it's just, it's another issue they got to deal with the last go around. They totally trashed the, uh, one, uh, really a synergistic and exploration driven space program and put in the, the shuttle got shutdown and, and money got moved to this or that.

Speaker 1:          27:17          So it's hard to keep this momentum going. Uh, so this is going to be very, this is a key thing. Where's that going to come from? What countries you actually going to take that role? Uh, I call it, uh, I'm trying this on you because I can't figure out what it is. But at the end of the book, when I got done, I got, I pushed the send button on the last chapter and I kept thinking, you know, back in the old exploration days and exploration of the oceans in particular, it's, it's a ship going off the edge of the earth. They were worried the sea serpents whirlpools scurvy. I mean, they went through all these things and I think we're sort of doing the same thing to ourselves. Cosmic Rays, Michael gravity radiation.

Speaker 4:          28:16          Okay.

Speaker 1:          28:17          There's less gravity on Mars. What does it do to you? Psychology? I think micro gravity, maybe the scurvy up today for space travelers. It's the kind of thing we'll defeat somehow. There'll be some new ideas. They'll be new ways to do that. And for the first time, everybody in this room, uh, w you know, the people going to Mars are going to be interactive. I mean, this is going to be, we're all going to go. Uh, I don't, I, I'm sure there'll be something else other than Gopro, but did it, will be on their helmets and will virtually be there with them for the first time in exploration history. Will, we're all going to be able to partake in this kind of unique travel to another world. And I call it now history. It's something totally now never been done before. And in fact, I hate to bother you guys up, but I couldn't have written this book without Google. It just, you know, for a research person and trying to understand all the different parameters of exploration of Mars, uh, the Internet, uh, how powerful it is and you can see where it's going to go. You guys are leading the charge on Google earth, Google, Mars. Um, it's definitely going to be interactive exploration like nothing we've ever had before.

Speaker 1:          29:37          So, Mars, we need you and I hope you'll contribute to the figuring out how best to solve some of these tough problems I've kind of outlined here. Um, there's the book, I hope you get the book, I think. How many seconds do I go? I gotta go, I gotta do this. I got something declassified. How many here have a security clearance? Okay, well nevermind. Uh, this is Leonard David in the kind of late in the 60s. I went to Mars with my project epic experimental, prolonged isolation jammer. I and my mom called it the die a death trap.

Speaker 1:          30:24          So here I am in my Mars Habitat. I built this out of plywood and some of the most advanced technologies I had available to me at the home depot. We had reversed vacuum cleaners to exchange the air. We had a life support equipment, uh, you know, toilets. We had it all in there. And uh, there's some elaborate a circuitry that was a, I borrow from the ninth grade and then electronic class 10 can, I don't even know what that was. Uh, this was, you know, recycling. Here's my friend. Jerry was about as crazy as I was and so I stayed in it for 12 hours. Jerry stayed in there for 24. He would, he broke the record.

Speaker 1:          31:21          This is me inside this thing. I had my little control panel cleverly. You have a note thing. So I can take notes. It's cold in here. Most of us were sent to NASA by the way, and I take that picked up in a couple of points. Again, some of the advanced circuitry that you learned or you can take notes and dark. We had an air lock so we can pass food. It would have had that tech a lot of time. Didn't make sure that this is light, no light getting in. No light. That was hard. Anyway, that was my trip back in the late sixties. I appreciate your time here and uh, I hope, uh, we have little time for questions and again, thank you for sharing your lunch hour with me. Anything, Eh, I guess you're supposed to use a microphone if that's the procedure.

Speaker 5:          32:24          Um, so you talked about the telepresence mission with humans in Mars' orbit, controlling robots below to, uh, assemble the habitats. Um, as you probably know, the uh, mission design that I find very intriguing anyway is send humans to Mars but never land them. You send humans to Mars, but they stay in orbit or maybe on Phobos or Damos our tele or our tele. Tell operating robots on the planet below so you get rid of the light time delays that you have with current robotic exploration. Right. Um, but you never have to fight more as gravity. Well, Dave, opinions about that

Speaker 1:          32:59          mission design, you know, I, it's, I'm just excited we can debate it, you know. Oh, should we go down to the surface? There's no our bet. Okay, that's great. Let's just get there now. We'll figure it out. But I do think the tele robotics is going to play a role no matter what. If you've got humans on Mars, they're going to be doing a lot of tele robotic things. The idea about the teller robotics, the first guy that I, Fred singer actually had a, what he called the Phd Program, which is Phobos and Deimos program. He made that point. He said, this life on Mars, is that an issue? And maybe we should just have sterilized robots running around down there. Um, I don't know which way it's going to go in. My guess is it's going to be shoot the Indians and ask questions later. You know, I'm afraid of that. Uh, Robert Zubrin or the Mars society is very big on, don't worry about it. And I think there's enough people in planetary protection and is saying, let's worry about it now. And we, in fact, we probably have already fouled up and asked a little bit here and there. So it's a good point. I don't know which way it's going to go, but I hope that discussion happens and that we were just arguing between, oh, well, you know, let's stay in orbit or go down. Let's get to that point.

Speaker 1:          34:18          My question is, uh, what do you see as Google's role or potential role in the colonization of Mars? Well, I, that's why I said I, I do think you have, uh, a seminal role here. And really, I mean it's, I think the whole team, I know you guys are what, 20, I don't know how many offices are all over the place, but yeah, how do we increase the public participation, citizen science? I mean, people want to be involved and I think the more we can do, everybody can take ownership in this. Everybody can be a pioneer at the same time. Never been done before on that scale of exploration and I, so whatever, you know, feedback loops or whatever it's going to be in the future. I just see this as an opportunity for everybody and the more people realize that they are actually going to learn by being involved in this and letting people do whatever they're going to do on the surface. And you know, again, I, it'd be beyond Gopro cameras, but there's a cool thing coming up on the Mars 2020 rover from Nasa for the first time. They have hearing devices on there. We'll actually hear Mars. So synthesizing the feel of Mars and hearing what's on Mars. I'm not sure if we're going to hear barking dogs. Maybe you never know. Uh, but the of wins of Mars and that being another human capability on that planet I think is that to me is exciting.

Speaker 6:          35:46          I was wondering if you could comment a little bit on some of the timelines and I dunno if you want to say anything about the plan I read about recently for 100,000 colonists.

Speaker 1:          35:57          Yeah, that's Alon. Alon Musk is a driven, driven the dream machine. You know, he's, he's got a pretty interesting concept and, you know, he's the guy that's put his money where his mouth is. I mean, he's building rockets, he's exploding rockets. He's learning. Uh, we've got a ways to go for, I see you didn't have planetary transports, but I mean he's got the master plan Kinda from ours in his mind of how it could, could work. Um, you know, I think what I liked about his talk and Mexico was that he, he, he made it sound like this is happening. This is where we're, I'm going, come along, you know. And so I think that's all helpful. Uh, every engineer I talked to after his talk you to have more detail, we're going to have a lot more detail on that one. So I think alliance got his work cut out for him to actually explain some of the, a, in fact there's some, uh, some early essays that are being written now about and criticizing some of its parts of his mission. But anyway, it's fine. To me, it's, that's part of the deal. That lawn, he's got to make rockets go up and come down. He's got that down. He's, you have this explosion with a space x rocket the other, a couple months ago or whatever it was. So, you know, he's not out of the woods about success. So we'll see. I think it's great. That's about all I can say about it. Let's make it happen. Anything else there?

Speaker 6:          37:29          Um, I want to ask, um, I know it was that Mohs or it's kind of like [inaudible] and other people are thinking about colonize a moon and a Venice. Others fear 50 miles can system the human balloon. Compare all of this, uh, a cons plying which fine, you've seen cases

Speaker 1:          37:49          or at least take or cost benefit. Yeah. Here's the problem. This is why I'm old and crotchety now because I signed up for looking at space and reporting about space long time ago, and the visionaries at the time, you know, we're blowing up rockets, but next to you on overhead dogs barking in space, uh, and the timelines that were suggested, go to the moon, go to Mars. We're going to Alpha Centauri interstellar flight. And I go, okay, that sounds good. Sounds like a checklist thing. Let's do all those. So I'm, I'm, I'm advocating having a strong space program that has all those elements in it. I this idea that somehow we get to Mars and it's all over is not part of my dream. Um, I've written about interstellar travel and there's lots of things you can see coming in the physics journals. We're going to be, the solar system's going to shrink where there's the speed levels were going at an hour.

Speaker 1:          38:49          Not going to be the way we're doing this. I flew out here from New York last night and I, I, if I was in a Conestoga wagon, I'd still becoming, let's say I'm not going to make it. Um, so transportation is going to change. We're going to get around the solar system much faster. So going to the moon, going to El Point's going to Mars. I, that should be some kind of integrated plan. If one country wants to pull the lunar village together, NASA is very keen on not spending money on the moon again, but going to a Mars, even buzz when I worked on the book with Buzz, I mean he doesn't want us tax dollars going back to the moon. He wants to spend the money on Mars. But we'll see. I, like I said, there's this European view of setting up a lunar village that you could take the resources there on the moon and make fuel, send them up to a position in space and that's the fuel you might want to use for your Mars transport system.

Speaker 1:          39:46          So, you know, whatever happens. It's cool as long as we don't discontinue everything because other countries are moving out. I think it's clear to me if he, if he have leadership, you had political, do you have a technological drive? Uh, in a country? I think the space program, uh, makes that happen. They can, it can do those kinds of things. It'd be a lot of spin offs and those kinds of things. I'm not a big spinoff person. I glad it happens, but I'm into into it for the exploration of it. I just think that's, this is what humans do. And Meyers is a metaphor for exploration. It's a metaphor for scientific discovery and also danger that that was a great elements for a drama.

Speaker 1:          40:33          Anything else? Second question. So what is it about Mars that excites more interest in exploration than say, Venus? Yeah, I like Venus too. It's hot. So hot. Uh, there's a lot of talk about life's in the clouds of Venus. I Dunno, there's some new books come in and will be very interesting. Uh, again, I don't really, I try not to, you know, in my lifetime I lost a planet. Pluto got demoted. I mean, I, as a kid, I had to learn all those plants and then you get one tossed off and I then I, then all of a sudden we have exoplanets discovered everywhere. I've gained several thousand or a thousand, whatever the number is today. Maybe they'd discovered something last night. Um, I'm sorry, what was the question?

Speaker 1:          41:31          Venus and Mars, I don't know Venus going to be there. There are some new spacecraft they're going to go to. Venus will understand it more the greenhouse effect on Venus. Is it something, a precursor to the way the earth is going to go under you? You hear all that, you know the classic line hint. It's so hot. It melts lad. Okay, well prove it. I don't know. Um, I, uh, I, I think Venus is, is interesting in its own right. They're all interesting. I mean, there's a lot of people want to go to Europa. We have a mission that's being prescriptive for your rope and landing on an icy moon. And that these moons are turning out to be interesting because of the potential for oceans underneath the ice. What's, you know, you've got people look trying to put a little detectors for whale sounds or something.

Speaker 1:          42:21          I don't know what they're going to be looking for. Anyway. I think all those are a player because we're starting to learn about our own backyard and this transportation thing of moving around much faster and, uh, is going to happen. So I think everything's going to be accessible. We can do a lot more. And the biggest thing is coming in here, a planetary exploration is a cube sats. You're going to start seeing these things as a small sats. I mean, I go do articles about people that worked. I've worked on the Galileo program. It took me 15 years of my life, you know, and, and uh, now you can put these things in a lab and a couple months, test them out. You get them on a rocket. They're going to be some cubes. Ads launched a lob to the moon here in a few years. So interplanetary and small sats are kind of coming together. So things like Venus and launching little balloons, they can travel around Venus. I'm up for it all. They're all, all, all planners are good.

Speaker 4:          43:25          Okay.

Speaker 1:          43:26          Anything else? Okay. I really appreciate your time. It's been okay. Oh, can you? Okay. Yep. I'd be remiss because the book is to companion piece to the trailer on a starch to November 14th at. This gives you an idea of where they're going in a docker drama. Yeah.

Speaker 7:          43:52          Place where you feel safest place, where you belong. Six months ago we left that place. We shut the confirm our warms the planet across the void, even though we might not do it, is our mission to make this place home. Mars a global event series coming this fall to the national geographic channel.

Speaker 1:          44:21          I didn't give you much. There is a surprise ending. Let me, let me finish with one thing that I, I long time ago I met Ray, anybody or Ray Bradbury Fan, ray Bradbury, I just, I was putting a conference together at jet propulsion lab and Ray Bradbury was the speaker and I got a chance to talk to him and I said, I really admire your writing and you know, how, how do you do it all? And he's like, he looked for the metaphor, look for the letter for it. Took me a while to figure that out. But I am I a the I but I ended the book with Ray Bradbury. Uh, he in 1976, Bradbury rejoiced in the touchdowns of the Viking one and two robot robotic landers on Mars sang today we have touched Mars, there is life on Mars and it is us extensions of our eyes in all directions. Extensions of our mind, extensions of our heart and soul. I've touched Mars today. That's the message she'll look for there. We are on Mars. We are the Martians, so thanks again. Appreciate it.

Speaker 3:          45:35          [inaudible].
