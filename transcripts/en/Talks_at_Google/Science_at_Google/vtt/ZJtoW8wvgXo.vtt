1
00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:12.660
Hey everyone.
Thank you for joining us today.
Um,
I'm [inaudible],

2
00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.330
I work on Google translate today.

3
00:00:15.331 --> 00:00:19.110
We have a very special guest Dr. Douglas Fields.

4
00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.710
He is a neuroscientist and an international authority on brain development,

5
00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.490
Neuroglia interactions and the cellular mechanisms of memory.

6
00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:34.800
He is currently chief of nervous system development and plasticity section at

7
00:00:34.801 --> 00:00:36.750
the National Institutes of health.

8
00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.440
And she is the author of many magazine articles and books including why we snap,

9
00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.930
which you can grab in the back if you haven't yet.

10
00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:50.990
And like we're were going to have a quick book signing and his other book is the

11
00:00:52.351 --> 00:00:56.210
other brain.
Please give a warm welcome to Dr [inaudible].

12
00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.710
<v 1>[inaudible].</v>

13
00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.400
<v 0>Thank you very much.
Thank you all for coming.
It's a delight to be here.
Um,</v>

14
00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:10.470
so I've been given the rare opportunity to talk about two books in one hour.

15
00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:14.310
Um,
normally either one of these subjects would take a whole hour.

16
00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:16.110
So I apologize.

17
00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.750
I'm going to go really quick and I'm going to only be able to hit the high

18
00:01:18.751 --> 00:01:23.670
points.
Um,
but,
uh,
you know,
I realize here at Google,

19
00:01:23.671 --> 00:01:27.830
you're,
you're a CPS or over clocked and you'll be able to do this,
but,
um,

20
00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:32.710
we'll get through it.
And the first talk is,
uh,
related to,
uh,

21
00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.190
the subject of snapping.
Um,

22
00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.490
so this is a very interesting topic that I think touches everyone.

23
00:01:40.621 --> 00:01:44.370
And one way or another,
um,
many people want to admit it,

24
00:01:44.371 --> 00:01:46.920
but everyone admits they know somebody else who has issues.

25
00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:52.730
And snapping is bewildering because it's this unconscious aggressive impulse

26
00:01:52.741 --> 00:01:55.920
that's triggered by something in the environment.
And it's not conscious.

27
00:01:55.921 --> 00:01:59.370
It's not deliberate.
Why break a dish?
Why smash a tennis racket?

28
00:01:59.371 --> 00:02:02.930
Why get into v vehicular jousting on the freeway and,

29
00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:06.000
and wreck your car or worse,
it doesn't make any sense.

30
00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:07.710
So that's what snapping is this,
this,

31
00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:10.680
and that's what's disturbing about it is that it's not conscious.

32
00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:15.600
It's rapid triggered by something in the environment and the behavior is

33
00:02:15.601 --> 00:02:19.640
incorrect.
Right?
Um,
it's followed by regret.
Uh,

34
00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.460
so it's kind of embarrassing.
It,
if it's appropriate behavior,
we call it,

35
00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.420
we don't call it snapping,
we call it quick thinking or something like that.
Um,

36
00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:32.510
so it is interesting because this covers an unconscious part of the brain that

37
00:02:34.501 --> 00:02:37.440
we're talking about.
Um,
and it seems to me that,
um,

38
00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:42.420
this is a new subject but a very important and overlook subject.

39
00:02:42.421 --> 00:02:43.980
When I read the newspapers every day,

40
00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:48.300
we read about the violence and domestic disputes,
barroom brawls,

41
00:02:48.301 --> 00:02:50.160
all these kinds of things.
And you know,

42
00:02:50.161 --> 00:02:53.040
it's not mentally ill people mental illness,

43
00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.520
people with mental illness do not commit violent acts anymore than anyone else.

44
00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:57.923
Um,

45
00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:03.470
and so we do understand how drugs can interfere with judgment,

46
00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.230
but I think we're overlooking the big issues.
The majority of,
uh,

47
00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:13.510
what we call snapping or violence that we read about every day is so called

48
00:03:13.511 --> 00:03:18.320
normal people.
Um,
and I'd like to understand how,
how that works.
Um,

49
00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:22.990
but it's actually broader than snapping when you get into the subject.

50
00:03:22.991 --> 00:03:25.780
The book has more than that because it's talking about,

51
00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:31.170
it involves the neurocircuitry of unconscious behaviors and threat detection.

52
00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:34.960
What's different about this approach in the book is it's not a psychological

53
00:03:34.961 --> 00:03:37.930
approach that you may be familiar with.
It's a neuroscience approach,

54
00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:41.200
which we look at snapping as a behavior.

55
00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:42.970
All behaviors are controlled by the brain.

56
00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:46.150
Let's go into the brain and see what circuits mediate this behavior.

57
00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:50.770
It's only been possible with new methods of neuroscience.
So that's,

58
00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:53.930
that's the,
uh,
the new approach.
Um,

59
00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:59.650
and also,
uh,
unconscious operation of the brain,
but also fear and whatnot.

60
00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:02.530
So the point is we're all wired for violence.

61
00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:05.720
We don't have to be taught violence.
Um,

62
00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:10.180
all animals need to have this aggressive behavior in order to protect
themselves,

63
00:04:10.181 --> 00:04:11.560
to protect their offspring.

64
00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:15.880
Carnivals need to have aggressive behavior in order to,
uh,
capture food.

65
00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:17.350
Um,

66
00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:22.350
it's the circuits that carry this out or not in the conscious part of the brain.

67
00:04:22.541 --> 00:04:25.900
They're in the unconscious part of the brain called the hypothalamus and other

68
00:04:25.901 --> 00:04:26.734
circuitry.

69
00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:32.080
And that's what I'd like to talk about is the circuitry of snapping.
So,

70
00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:35.380
um,
and aggressive behavior.
We're all wired for violence.

71
00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:40.650
And in order to give you an idea of what made me realize that I want to read a

72
00:04:41.741 --> 00:04:46.741
snippet out of my book because this is what inspired me to try to understand,

73
00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:52.080
uh,
it was an instance where I snapped and,
uh,

74
00:04:52.081 --> 00:04:57.081
I wanted to realize if I could risk my life or limb in an incident and in

75
00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:00.070
response to something in my environment.

76
00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:04.840
I want to know how that works and not be consciously aware of it.

77
00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:06.970
Okay.
So,
um,

78
00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:11.350
after Paris we traveled to Barcelona for my next lecture at an international

79
00:05:11.351 --> 00:05:14.620
meeting of neuroscientists.
The morning before the meeting began,

80
00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:18.820
we made a quick visit to the Audi Cathedral is sending the steps out of the

81
00:05:18.821 --> 00:05:21.910
dingy subway station smelling of concrete dust and sweat.

82
00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:24.340
We emerged in the brilliant Barcelona son,

83
00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:28.210
a crowd of passengers pressed upon us and a gray blurred.

84
00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:32.590
So I was traveling to a neuroscience meeting and I brought my 17 year old

85
00:05:32.591 --> 00:05:35.140
daughter with me.
That's very unusual.
Usually I travel alone,

86
00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:38.320
so we thought we'd go see the Gaudi Cathedral before I give my lecture.

87
00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:40.900
So we're coming up out of the subway system.

88
00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:46.030
Suddenly I felt a sharp tug at my pant leg as if swatting a mosquito.

89
00:05:46.031 --> 00:05:50.500
I slapped a zipper pocket,
but my left me Lee knee to my wallet was gone.

90
00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:55.900
My left arm shot back blindly in a flash.

91
00:05:55.901 --> 00:05:59.720
I closed line the robber as he pivoted to hand my wa while it off to his partner

92
00:05:59.721 --> 00:06:02.780
and flea down the steps as if swinging a sledgehammer.

93
00:06:02.781 --> 00:06:06.290
I hurled him by his neck over my left hip and slammed and belly first under the

94
00:06:06.291 --> 00:06:09.410
pavement where I flattened into the ground and apply to headlock.

95
00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:14.330
Displaying playing my legs for hip control like a wrestler pending an opponent I

96
00:06:14.331 --> 00:06:18.200
yelled for help.
Right.
56 years old,
130 pounds.

97
00:06:18.201 --> 00:06:22.100
Wire rimmed glasses gray here.
Um,
I have no martial arts training.

98
00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:26.330
I have no military experience,
no background in street fighting,

99
00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:29.420
drawing on junior high school wrestling moves.

100
00:06:29.421 --> 00:06:32.680
40 years ago I found myself applying an illegal chokehold.

101
00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:36.650
The streets smarts hoodlum struggling in my arms was in his late twenties,

102
00:06:36.651 --> 00:06:41.090
early thirties.
Police.
I shouted.
Call the police.
I've got him.

103
00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:45.770
Well,
there was no reply,
no gasps of shock from the dense crowd.

104
00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:50.240
No one was coming to my aid.
Instead.
From my perspective on the ground,

105
00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:53.870
all I saw were men's feet closing it around me in a tight circle.

106
00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:58.520
They were all part of the gang oblivious to being hunted as pray.

107
00:06:58.521 --> 00:07:02.810
We assumed that the crowd was the normal throng of passengers bumping a Jocelyn

108
00:07:02.811 --> 00:07:04.190
through the Barcelona metro system.

109
00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:08.600
The muscle man beneath me struggle to break my grip with his neck in the crook

110
00:07:08.601 --> 00:07:09.434
of my left arm.

111
00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:13.400
I synched with all the forests my biceps could produce cutting the blood off to

112
00:07:13.401 --> 00:07:16.310
his brain and air into his lungs,
bending his head back.

113
00:07:16.311 --> 00:07:19.940
I took his spine backward,
painfully tipping his face skyward,

114
00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:21.260
his eyes and mouth open,

115
00:07:21.261 --> 00:07:25.400
wide in shock pain and fear the wallet pop free as he tossed it toward his

116
00:07:25.401 --> 00:07:29.660
accomplice and grass furiously at my arm to break my strength.
That's my wallet.

117
00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:33.770
I yelled,
I woman's hand shot between the thicket of legs.

118
00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:35.780
Instantly I recognized it is my daughter's.

119
00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:39.350
She had been cut off by the gang that had encircled and trapped us and circling

120
00:07:39.351 --> 00:07:41.420
me silently like a pack of wolves,

121
00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:44.750
captain of the ultimate football Frisbee team.

122
00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:49.670
Kelly dove through the air in an arc as if to deflect the disc inches from an

123
00:07:49.671 --> 00:07:52.910
opponent's grasp in a full on layout on a solid concrete.

124
00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:56.840
She intercepted the past and miss mid air and tip the wallet into the palm of my

125
00:07:56.841 --> 00:08:01.040
outstretched right hand,
reading the eyes on accomplice,

126
00:08:01.070 --> 00:08:03.230
fixating on my blackberry,
spinning on the pavement.

127
00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:05.930
She lunged again and beat him to the prize.

128
00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:09.470
With my wallet retrieved and realized that I was horribly outnumbered.

129
00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:14.240
I released the thief and bounced to the balls of my feet as he scurried

130
00:08:14.241 --> 00:08:18.320
backwards on his butt like an injured crab escaping crazy man.

131
00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:23.320
He gasped looking into the eyes of the half dozen muscular thug surrounding me.

132
00:08:23.331 --> 00:08:27.410
I tried to discern if he choked out those partly words to deflect suspicion or

133
00:08:27.411 --> 00:08:28.490
if he meant it as a threat.

134
00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:33.950
Now what a massive surge of adrenaline fueled my twitching muscles and nerves to

135
00:08:33.951 --> 00:08:36.230
levels of raw power I had never felt before.

136
00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:40.970
I was now struggling not to pick up the next hoodlum squaring off with me,

137
00:08:40.971 --> 00:08:43.550
hoist him over my head and hurling into the accomplices,

138
00:08:43.551 --> 00:08:47.230
knocking them all down steps to the metro station like bowling pins.
Now,

139
00:08:47.231 --> 00:08:50.000
it wasn't a question of whether I could execute the superhuman feat.

140
00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:54.410
I had no doubt that I could do it.
It was charged with adrenaline.
Rather,

141
00:08:54.411 --> 00:08:57.810
I was trying not to do it simply because this might not be my mass move,

142
00:08:57.811 --> 00:09:01.530
at least not yet.
Suddenly in middle age,
well dressed,
Spaniard,

143
00:09:01.531 --> 00:09:05.520
stuck casually between me and the attackers and with flicking shoeing motions of

144
00:09:05.521 --> 00:09:08.280
his fingers.
He said he know crazy.

145
00:09:08.430 --> 00:09:13.380
Go now without breaking stride.
He descended the steps into the metro station.

146
00:09:13.770 --> 00:09:15.450
As he passed me,
he smiled and said,

147
00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:19.260
why no good go now in passing,

148
00:09:19.261 --> 00:09:22.170
he had deflected the situation to its best possible outcome.
Uh,

149
00:09:22.171 --> 00:09:27.120
draw the band of robbers scattered into the metro station like rats down a
sewer,

150
00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:31.110
leaving my daughter and me standing there stunned my wallet clenched in a death

151
00:09:31.111 --> 00:09:35.040
grip and my right hand.
Unfortunately that was not the end of it.

152
00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:39.390
The gang pursued Kelly and me throughout the city for the next two hours.

153
00:09:40.180 --> 00:09:41.970
There were not after my wallet anymore.

154
00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:46.560
I had humiliated and beaten up a member of their gang.
They wanted revenge.

155
00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:50.610
I tried every trick to elude them fleeing into tourist shops and through noisy

156
00:09:50.611 --> 00:09:52.470
restaurants,
cutting through back alleys,

157
00:09:52.471 --> 00:09:56.250
abruptly crossing streets to reverse course changing clothing and when they got

158
00:09:56.251 --> 00:09:59.640
too close,
leaving the sidewalk and running down the center of the boulevard,

159
00:09:59.641 --> 00:10:01.230
weaving through oncoming cars.

160
00:10:01.470 --> 00:10:04.950
At one point we stopped traffic to jump into a taxi in the middle of a three

161
00:10:04.951 --> 00:10:05.784
lane boulevard,

162
00:10:05.970 --> 00:10:10.530
but they had cell phones and everywhere we went they sent increasingly menacing,

163
00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:14.250
tattooed thugs with steroid bloated biceps to intercept us.

164
00:10:14.910 --> 00:10:16.380
As we dodged the gang of robbers,

165
00:10:16.381 --> 00:10:19.170
we witnessed them casually pick wallets from two more tourists.

166
00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:21.840
I even snapped photographs of them doing it.

167
00:10:21.940 --> 00:10:25.440
The stupid mistake is it turned out because the lookout on my side of the street

168
00:10:25.441 --> 00:10:26.274
caught me doing it.

169
00:10:26.910 --> 00:10:30.660
The unshaven goon came running up the sidewalk jabbering Russian into a cell

170
00:10:30.661 --> 00:10:34.590
phone and extending a video camera and an unconvincing attempt to as a tourist.

171
00:10:35.250 --> 00:10:38.340
We fled down the side street.
And as they closed in on us,

172
00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:41.280
we are forced to jump into a taxi and escape to a small town,

173
00:10:41.281 --> 00:10:43.350
an hour away in the cab.

174
00:10:43.351 --> 00:10:46.680
My daughter asked in a tone filled with shock and disbelief,

175
00:10:47.070 --> 00:10:48.420
where did you learn to do that?

176
00:10:48.780 --> 00:10:51.360
I looked over and saw you swinging some guy around by the neck.

177
00:10:51.390 --> 00:10:55.380
I couldn't figure out what was happening.
I laughed.
A nurse,
nervous relief,

178
00:10:55.810 --> 00:11:00.000
170 euro cab fare.
Later we were broke but safe.

179
00:11:00.390 --> 00:11:03.960
And now my daughter is convinced that my job at the National Institutes of

180
00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:08.400
health is just a cover for my real job as a spy.
All right?

181
00:11:08.401 --> 00:11:13.401
So I realized there I was on the ground and suddenly this thought bubbles up to

182
00:11:13.681 --> 00:11:18.420
my head.
What the heck are you doing?
So the point is,

183
00:11:18.421 --> 00:11:22.830
the neural circuitry involved in that behavior didn't involve my cerebral
cortex.

184
00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:27.210
And that's because when you're faced with a sudden a threatening situation,

185
00:11:27.630 --> 00:11:32.520
conscious deliberation is too slow.
Your conscious brain can't hold her,
um,

186
00:11:32.580 --> 00:11:35.640
and it can hold enough information and operates too slowly.

187
00:11:36.030 --> 00:11:39.930
So the brain's threat detection mechanism is subcortical unconscious.

188
00:11:40.530 --> 00:11:45.270
Um,
and the wiring for this is,
uh,
in,
in,

189
00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:49.680
uh,
the Amygdala and in,
uh,
in the hypothalamus.

190
00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:54.340
So as I was a wandering around with my daughter,

191
00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:56.560
consciously engaged in where we're going to go,

192
00:11:57.100 --> 00:12:00.430
my threatened the Pec detection mechanism was looking at threats.

193
00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:03.050
And that's happening with all of you.
You're constantly happier,

194
00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:07.060
huge part of your brain devoted to threat detection and on the lookout for

195
00:12:07.090 --> 00:12:07.481
threats.

196
00:12:07.481 --> 00:12:11.650
So all the sensory information before it goes to your cerebral cortex vision

197
00:12:11.651 --> 00:12:15.850
sound goes to the center of your threat detection mechanism in the Amygdala.

198
00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:19.750
That's why you can dodge a basket ball,
get it out of the way.
And then you go,

199
00:12:19.751 --> 00:12:23.110
what was that?
That was visual information going to your Amygdala.

200
00:12:23.770 --> 00:12:28.360
And then later it goes to your cerebral cortex,
but you've already acted.
So,

201
00:12:28.390 --> 00:12:32.620
um,
um,
in the early twenties,
Walter Hess,

202
00:12:33.230 --> 00:12:37.750
a stuck electrodes into a cat brain and stimulate a different parts of the
brain.

203
00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:41.350
And he found one part in the hypothalamus.
When he stimulated this,

204
00:12:41.351 --> 00:12:46.120
the cat launched into an attack and would kill another animal in its cage.

205
00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:50.860
So this area is called the hypothalamic attack area.
And uh,

206
00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:54.080
this is true and other animals and humans have it as well.
So this,

207
00:12:54.130 --> 00:12:59.130
the question is what feeds into this attack area to cause this violent response.

208
00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:02.740
Um,

209
00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:07.740
and the new information is showing that very discrete circuits feed into this

210
00:13:08.231 --> 00:13:10.480
area in response to different threats.

211
00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:13.270
Aggressive behavior is highly regulated.

212
00:13:13.271 --> 00:13:17.770
You're not going to engage in aggression for anything but very except very

213
00:13:17.771 --> 00:13:20.740
specific reasons because you're risking your life and limb.

214
00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:22.870
So it's highly regulated now,

215
00:13:22.871 --> 00:13:26.830
although it seems that anything could trigger aggression when you read the
paper.

216
00:13:27.010 --> 00:13:31.240
In fact,
very few things can only nine different things.

217
00:13:31.390 --> 00:13:34.210
And these evolved different circuits.
So,
um,

218
00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:39.400
this has scientists have been able to do in recent years is used new methods up

219
00:13:39.761 --> 00:13:42.850
to genetics and uh,
to genetic engineering.

220
00:13:42.850 --> 00:13:47.850
So you can engineer neurons to release flashes of light when they fire stick a

221
00:13:48.821 --> 00:13:51.730
fiber optic camera into a experimental animal,

222
00:13:51.850 --> 00:13:55.390
haven't engaged in aggression and see which neurons light up.
And now you know,

223
00:13:55.391 --> 00:13:56.224
the circuitry,

224
00:13:56.650 --> 00:14:01.650
you can activate and inactivate specific neurons by shining a laser into the

225
00:14:02.201 --> 00:14:02.980
brain.

226
00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:07.330
And neurons that are genetically encoded to respond to that light by firing or

227
00:14:07.390 --> 00:14:11.830
inhibiting.
So now you can turn on behaviors,
different aggressive behaviors.

228
00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:16.120
What this line of research has shown is that very specific behaviors like

229
00:14:16.121 --> 00:14:19.210
maternal aggression here familiar with Ralph,
familiar with maternal aggression.

230
00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:23.950
If you threatened them,
others,
uh,
young,
then the mother will attack.

231
00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:28.690
Um,
using these methods I've talked about,
you could see that circuitry,

232
00:14:29.170 --> 00:14:34.030
you can activate those circuits with a laser and activate the mother to,
uh,

233
00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:37.300
exhibit aggressive behavior against an intruder.

234
00:14:37.630 --> 00:14:42.370
You can inactivate that and the mother will no longer protect her pups.
However,

235
00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:46.810
she still will have aggressive responses to different kinds of threats.

236
00:14:47.110 --> 00:14:50.650
So this has led to realizing that our threat detection mechanism,

237
00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:54.020
unlike old idea of the lizard brain,
the primitive part of the brain,

238
00:14:54.021 --> 00:14:58.640
cause you do Beasley things.
No,
we have very elaborate,
exquisite,

239
00:14:58.730 --> 00:15:00.140
um,
uh,

240
00:15:00.650 --> 00:15:05.210
neural circuitry to release aggression in response to specific triggers.

241
00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:08.720
So,
um,
let me

242
00:15:10.220 --> 00:15:14.830
tell you about the triggers.
And again,
these are based on neurocircuitry,

243
00:15:14.990 --> 00:15:18.110
not on some classification.
And if you read the neuroscience,

244
00:15:18.111 --> 00:15:20.660
behavioral physiologist and psychologist,

245
00:15:20.661 --> 00:15:24.590
they all have different terminology.
For aggression,

246
00:15:24.620 --> 00:15:28.760
different kinds of aggression.
I've dispensed with that.
And for two reasons,

247
00:15:29.180 --> 00:15:32.870
I thought that would be helpful to understand the mechanisms to have in the

248
00:15:32.871 --> 00:15:35.900
monic so that you could remember these nine circuits that will trigger

249
00:15:35.901 --> 00:15:38.030
aggression.
And secondly,

250
00:15:38.570 --> 00:15:42.350
this will also allow you to control the circuitry because in fact,

251
00:15:42.380 --> 00:15:46.830
we have these circuits because we need them.
You don't want to prevent,
uh,

252
00:15:47.030 --> 00:15:51.050
this response in the right circumstance.
You just want to prevent the misfires.

253
00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:55.910
So if you can suddenly feel the sense of rage on the highway,

254
00:15:55.911 --> 00:15:57.250
let's say,
um,

255
00:15:58.010 --> 00:16:01.010
and understand which of these life more it's triggered,

256
00:16:01.490 --> 00:16:03.620
the mnemonic I created was life marts,

257
00:16:04.370 --> 00:16:09.370
then you can control the rage response because you'll realize it's a misfire and

258
00:16:09.711 --> 00:16:11.300
the rage will subside.

259
00:16:11.810 --> 00:16:14.750
So there's not gonna be time to go through all these triggers.
Um,

260
00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:19.960
but I'll just quickly talk about some Elf for life and limb.

261
00:16:20.180 --> 00:16:23.630
We've already talked about,
um,
you know,
uh,
defensive aggression.

262
00:16:23.660 --> 00:16:28.220
If you're attacked,
you will fight back any animal will.
Um,

263
00:16:29.450 --> 00:16:34.130
we also mentioned a maternal aggression.
That's the F in life.

264
00:16:34.131 --> 00:16:35.960
Morts.
Um,

265
00:16:37.790 --> 00:16:40.310
the trigger is environment.

266
00:16:41.750 --> 00:16:43.730
Many animals are territorial.

267
00:16:43.820 --> 00:16:48.820
And they will defend their territory aggressively and market fiercely defend

268
00:16:49.191 --> 00:16:53.900
intrusion,
intruders,
uh,
primates and humans are,
are fiercely territorial.

269
00:16:54.110 --> 00:16:55.880
Uh,
intruders will be shot.

270
00:16:56.090 --> 00:16:59.750
Somebody enters your house on announced it's going to trigger an aggressive

271
00:16:59.751 --> 00:17:03.400
response.
So that's the,
uh,
the trigger.

272
00:17:04.270 --> 00:17:06.860
I'm just going to give you another example.
I can't go through them all.

273
00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:08.360
T is for tribe.

274
00:17:08.810 --> 00:17:13.460
Social animals use aggression to protect their group.

275
00:17:13.670 --> 00:17:15.710
Many animals will have this.
Um,

276
00:17:15.770 --> 00:17:19.130
and certainly human beings have this capability as well.
I mean,

277
00:17:19.131 --> 00:17:23.420
the selective service system proves that we all have the capability for violence

278
00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:28.250
and destruction to protect our country,
for example.
Um,

279
00:17:28.430 --> 00:17:30.800
so that's the t for tried programming.

280
00:17:30.890 --> 00:17:34.220
We need to realize that's also the key to our success.

281
00:17:34.580 --> 00:17:39.580
That we can go shirts and skins and play at the maximum physical metal

282
00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:42.200
capability of the human being on a basketball court.

283
00:17:42.410 --> 00:17:46.850
Just arbitrarily divide into two teams.
This is what got us to the moon.

284
00:17:46.851 --> 00:17:49.040
We compete with another country.
Um,

285
00:17:49.050 --> 00:17:53.220
so this is really the key to our success as a species,

286
00:17:53.221 --> 00:17:58.100
but it also leads to racism,
leads to wars.
It leads to gang violence.
Uh,

287
00:17:58.110 --> 00:18:02.070
so those are two of the triggers that I want to mention.
Um,

288
00:18:02.370 --> 00:18:04.980
and I just don't have time to go through them all,
but I want to give one,

289
00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:06.480
make one more point.

290
00:18:06.660 --> 00:18:10.080
We have these circuits and better than our brain because we have the same brain

291
00:18:10.081 --> 00:18:14.070
we had a hundred thousand years ago when we lived in the plains of Africa and we

292
00:18:14.071 --> 00:18:18.930
are fighting tooth and nail for fight,
for survival.
Same brain,

293
00:18:19.290 --> 00:18:20.910
but we're now operating in an environment.

294
00:18:20.911 --> 00:18:24.600
Our brain was never evolved to operate in completely different world.

295
00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:29.250
So what happens is you get misfires triggered by situations in the modern world

296
00:18:29.251 --> 00:18:34.020
that never existed.
Driving is a great example.
It hits almost all these triggers.

297
00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:36.900
So I'll just give you one and it's the trigger.

298
00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:39.960
So you're out on one oh one you're driving on the freeway,

299
00:18:40.140 --> 00:18:41.280
somebody cuts in front of you.

300
00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:44.370
Suddenly you're feeling enraged and some people will,
you know,

301
00:18:45.060 --> 00:18:48.360
and in a gun battle or,
or a rack.
But we all,

302
00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:53.400
many people will feel the sudden rage when somebody does that.
Why,
why,

303
00:18:53.401 --> 00:18:54.510
why do we feel anger?

304
00:18:54.511 --> 00:18:58.860
Why don't we feel some other emotion that's a misfire.

305
00:18:59.100 --> 00:19:02.370
We perceive the area around our cars,
our territory.

306
00:19:02.550 --> 00:19:06.060
Somebody intruded into our territory trip.

307
00:19:06.061 --> 00:19:10.350
This trigger for us to defend it for the purpose of the activity.

308
00:19:10.351 --> 00:19:12.000
We're involved in transportation.

309
00:19:12.030 --> 00:19:15.150
It doesn't matter if the guy's on your front bumper,
your bat bumper.

310
00:19:15.151 --> 00:19:16.920
It's a matter of a couple of seconds difference.

311
00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:20.550
But it's this illusion that we're traveling with territory.

312
00:19:20.790 --> 00:19:23.760
If you're running and having a foot race over the ground,
that never happens.

313
00:19:23.761 --> 00:19:25.200
People are free to run ahead of you.

314
00:19:25.380 --> 00:19:27.840
Somebody cuts in front of you and there's faster.
You might laugh,

315
00:19:27.841 --> 00:19:32.370
you wouldn't get angry.
So,
um,
that's an example of,

316
00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:33.270
of a misfire.

317
00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:38.100
So the point is we have these circuits because we need them.

318
00:19:38.580 --> 00:19:42.840
They exist because they're important to our survival.

319
00:19:43.350 --> 00:19:46.390
Um,
and it's,
it's not,
uh,
you know,

320
00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:50.200
it's not necessarily a disorder,
but a,

321
00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:53.490
but a misfiring.
And I want to give an example again,

322
00:19:53.491 --> 00:19:55.450
read a snippet out of the book.
Uh,

323
00:19:55.460 --> 00:19:59.970
the demonstrates why we have these triggers.
Um,

324
00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:04.800
it just say that many cases,
uh,
the same thing happens when you have a hero.

325
00:20:04.830 --> 00:20:06.450
Will come to the aid of somebody and they say,
well,

326
00:20:06.451 --> 00:20:08.220
what were you thinking when you did that?
And they say,

327
00:20:08.221 --> 00:20:11.430
I didn't think I just reacted.
And afterwards they're shaking,
but they,

328
00:20:11.790 --> 00:20:15.900
they were heroic.
So here's an example,
a snippet from the book.

329
00:20:17.700 --> 00:20:21.450
Lucky.
What are you doing?
Get your butt up here.
Let's go.
Heather.

330
00:20:21.451 --> 00:20:26.190
Lucky Penny was 26 year old DC Air National Guard lieutenant stationed at

331
00:20:26.191 --> 00:20:30.160
Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland.
Jolted by or just see she aborted.

332
00:20:30.210 --> 00:20:32.070
The methodical checklist climbed in,

333
00:20:32.071 --> 00:20:37.071
ignited the engines and scream for ground crew to pull the wheel chocks within

334
00:20:37.171 --> 00:20:37.501
minutes.

335
00:20:37.501 --> 00:20:40.980
The petite blonde was piloting the [inaudible] fighter jet screeching at top

336
00:20:40.981 --> 00:20:43.260
speed through the crystal blue sky with your commander.

337
00:20:43.380 --> 00:20:46.470
Colonel Mark Says Seville piloting his own jet on our wing.

338
00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:52.260
The date was September 11 2001 both the twin towers and the Pentagon had just

339
00:20:54.371 --> 00:20:55.204
been hit.

340
00:20:56.170 --> 00:20:59.560
There was a fourth passenger jet commandeered by Islamic terrorists targeting

341
00:20:59.561 --> 00:21:01.600
the United States capitol and the White House.

342
00:21:02.350 --> 00:21:05.740
Obviously Heather knew there was no chance that any of the men,

343
00:21:06.070 --> 00:21:09.790
women and children on board United Airlines seven 57 passenger jet,

344
00:21:09.791 --> 00:21:14.770
she was intent on their septic would survive and an improbable twist of fate.

345
00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:18.940
There was a good chance that Heather penny's own father could be the captain on

346
00:21:18.941 --> 00:21:22.840
the United Flight 93 which she was disturbed,
determined to destroy.

347
00:21:23.910 --> 00:21:27.130
It sounds cold hearted.
I mean that was my daddy.

348
00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:30.670
Penny said in an interview afterwards,

349
00:21:31.870 --> 00:21:36.430
I couldn't think about it.
I had a job to do.
She said later to her mom,

350
00:21:37.330 --> 00:21:40.390
we don't train to bring down airliners.
Colonel Sasa.
Bill said,

351
00:21:40.450 --> 00:21:42.850
describing the gut wrenching,
unthinkable act.

352
00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:47.320
He and Heather Penny we're about to commit training would have been useless in

353
00:21:47.321 --> 00:21:50.020
any case.
Neither of their jets was armed.

354
00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:54.430
No one had anticipated the need to have fully armed fighter jets at the ready to

355
00:21:54.431 --> 00:21:58.630
protect against an aerial attack originating from within the United States.

356
00:22:00.460 --> 00:22:05.350
I'm going to go for the cockpit.
Sasa Bill said,
I'll take the tail.
Penny replied,

357
00:22:05.351 --> 00:22:06.340
without hesitation.

358
00:22:07.150 --> 00:22:10.930
I genuinely believe that this was going to be the last time I took off.
She said,

359
00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:13.090
now a single mom with two girls.

360
00:22:13.810 --> 00:22:17.110
I had already given myself up knowing what my duty was.

361
00:22:18.250 --> 00:22:21.670
She was fully committed to ramming or jet into the passenger plane to bring it

362
00:22:21.671 --> 00:22:25.960
down.
As fate would have it,
her father,
Colonel John Penny,

363
00:22:25.961 --> 00:22:28.810
was not piloting United 93 that morning.

364
00:22:29.050 --> 00:22:32.560
It was as good friend Jason Doll with Jason on the plane.

365
00:22:32.561 --> 00:22:35.680
It would have been an additional level of grief.
Jon Penny said later,

366
00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:41.410
but lieutenant penny and Colonel Sas Advil never had to execute their kamikaze

367
00:22:41.411 --> 00:22:46.120
mission.
Let's roll.
Said 32 year old Todd Beamer,

368
00:22:46.330 --> 00:22:48.670
a passenger on the hijacked fat flight.

369
00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:53.260
Those were the last words of the soon to be father ending his conversation with

370
00:22:53.261 --> 00:22:56.440
telephone,
switchboard operator,
Lisa Jefferson,

371
00:22:56.800 --> 00:22:59.980
whom he had been relaying information to for the last 13 minutes of the

372
00:22:59.981 --> 00:23:00.814
hijacking.

373
00:23:01.930 --> 00:23:06.730
They had just finished reciting the Lord's Prayer and Psalms 23 together though

374
00:23:06.731 --> 00:23:09.970
I walk through the Valley of the shadow of death,
I fear no evil,

375
00:23:10.060 --> 00:23:14.050
evil for thou art with me,
thy Rod and thy staff,

376
00:23:14.410 --> 00:23:19.210
they comfort me.
Beamer and the other passengers stormed the hijackers.

377
00:23:19.270 --> 00:23:23.680
Jeremy Glick is a six foot judo champion.
Mark Bingham was a rugby player.

378
00:23:23.980 --> 00:23:28.670
Tom Burnett had been a college quarterback.
Louis Knack was a weight lifter.

379
00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:31.120
William Cashman,
a former paratrooper.

380
00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:35.230
The cockpit recorder captures the sound of food carts ramming the cockpit door

381
00:23:35.231 --> 00:23:38.410
and the cries of terrorist screaming at one another to hold the door closed.

382
00:23:39.070 --> 00:23:42.340
The door burst open.
Let's get them is heard on the recording.

383
00:23:42.370 --> 00:23:46.970
As passengers overwhelmed the terrorists,
they were the true heroes.

384
00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:51.680
Heather Penny says these were average everyday Americans who gave their lives to

385
00:23:51.681 --> 00:23:52.940
save countless more.

386
00:23:53.500 --> 00:23:56.930
The selflessness reminds us that we're a part of something greater than

387
00:23:56.931 --> 00:24:00.620
ourselves,
that there are things in this world more important than ourselves.

388
00:24:02.090 --> 00:24:05.390
Today there's a memorial and the green pastures in southwestern Pennsylvania and

389
00:24:05.391 --> 00:24:09.020
the White House in the United States.
Capitol stands spared from the destruction.

390
00:24:09.770 --> 00:24:14.750
This is the power of the tribe,
trigger to life risking violence,
gangs,
wars,

391
00:24:14.751 --> 00:24:17.030
racism,
or it's ugly,
dark side.

392
00:24:17.450 --> 00:24:20.930
But this bit of neural circuitry is very much a part of what makes us human.

393
00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:25.190
They can unleash the best in human nature,
set the sacrifice for others.

394
00:24:25.910 --> 00:24:27.260
It is the trigger of heroism.

395
00:24:27.710 --> 00:24:30.950
And as the monument now standing in the fields of Pennsylvania reminds us,

396
00:24:31.310 --> 00:24:33.500
it's a vital part of every one of us.

397
00:24:35.630 --> 00:24:39.890
So we have these circuits for reason.
I can't,

398
00:24:40.310 --> 00:24:44.060
in the interest of time,
I have to come to a close.
Um,
I,
uh,

399
00:24:44.170 --> 00:24:48.110
other important points that I would like to make is that stress is important.

400
00:24:48.260 --> 00:24:51.410
Knowing the circuits as important because you can control it,

401
00:24:51.530 --> 00:24:53.960
but understanding that stress changes the threshold.

402
00:24:54.170 --> 00:24:56.180
If you're in a stressful environment,
um,

403
00:24:56.360 --> 00:25:00.440
you're more likely to have these trip same as the military putting its defense

404
00:25:00.441 --> 00:25:02.330
mechanism,
not on high alert.

405
00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:06.350
If you grow up in a bad part of Palo Alto or Baltimore,

406
00:25:06.440 --> 00:25:10.820
you're going to wire the brain so that you have a hair trigger because you can't

407
00:25:10.821 --> 00:25:14.690
afford to be victimized.
Um,
and

408
00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:20.170
I don't want to give away the book,
but I will.
Um,

409
00:25:20.450 --> 00:25:24.260
I reacted that way in Barcelona because we were under intense stress.

410
00:25:24.350 --> 00:25:29.120
That was the second time we were robbed and my Amygdala had learned that and

411
00:25:29.121 --> 00:25:31.700
didn't talk to my cortex about it,
but it wasn't going to happen again.

412
00:25:32.580 --> 00:25:36.140
The second point I'd like to make is that this mechanism threat detection

413
00:25:36.141 --> 00:25:38.540
mechanism is controlled by the cerebral cortex.

414
00:25:38.840 --> 00:25:42.740
And there are people who are completely nonviolent.
I interviewed them.
Um,
James,

415
00:25:42.741 --> 00:25:46.970
for example,
who will kill nothing and,
uh,

416
00:25:47.030 --> 00:25:49.390
no living animal.
And um,

417
00:25:50.150 --> 00:25:53.750
so it is possible to have cortical control over this,
this circuitry.

418
00:25:54.140 --> 00:25:58.100
I spoke to a teal,
a seal team,

419
00:25:58.101 --> 00:26:01.160
six member told him what I did in Barcelona.
He said,
yeah,

420
00:26:01.161 --> 00:26:02.460
I never would have done that.
You know,

421
00:26:02.510 --> 00:26:05.460
here's the guy who could take out a pickpocket with judo chop,
you know,

422
00:26:05.530 --> 00:26:09.500
doing a selfie and he wouldn't have done it.
And they train so that they,

423
00:26:09.590 --> 00:26:10.650
that they,
um,

424
00:26:12.080 --> 00:26:16.130
that they can control with cortical control,
these defensive behaviors.

425
00:26:16.690 --> 00:26:19.940
Um,
and the other thing I wish I had time to talk about is gender.

426
00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:24.920
The most important factor in aggression as gender.
94% of all,

427
00:26:25.130 --> 00:26:27.260
um,
uh,

428
00:26:27.500 --> 00:26:31.310
criminals and prison for violent crime are male.

429
00:26:32.570 --> 00:26:33.403
Um,

430
00:26:34.310 --> 00:26:38.660
but 94% of the people who have been given awards for heroism by the Carnegie

431
00:26:38.660 --> 00:26:39.493
Foundation,
our mail,

432
00:26:40.250 --> 00:26:44.460
a quarter of those died instantly giving their life often for a stranger to come

433
00:26:44.461 --> 00:26:48.360
to their aid.
Um,
so gender is very important.

434
00:26:48.361 --> 00:26:50.730
The neurosurgeon science of that is very interesting.

435
00:26:51.330 --> 00:26:54.720
Men and women face different threats.
Their threat detection wiring is different.

436
00:26:54.750 --> 00:26:55.950
I wish I could go into that.

437
00:26:56.420 --> 00:26:57.253
<v 1>MMM.</v>

438
00:26:59.390 --> 00:27:00.580
<v 0>Let's see.
Um,</v>

439
00:27:02.590 --> 00:27:03.350
<v 1>yeah,</v>

440
00:27:03.350 --> 00:27:08.350
<v 0>I'll just end on one thing that it has been known for some time that stimulating</v>

441
00:27:10.251 --> 00:27:15.251
the hypothalamic attack region in animals and do in addition to inducing

442
00:27:16.041 --> 00:27:20.630
aggression can induce copulation.
So,
you know,

443
00:27:20.631 --> 00:27:22.760
through his,
through literature and psychology,

444
00:27:22.761 --> 00:27:25.370
there's always this connection between sex and violence.
Now,

445
00:27:25.371 --> 00:27:28.460
what we never knew is that if you stimulate this hypothalamic region,

446
00:27:28.850 --> 00:27:32.660
are you stimulating nerve fibers that are just passing by your electrode in the

447
00:27:32.661 --> 00:27:34.910
neurons or somewhere else in the brain?
Well,

448
00:27:34.911 --> 00:27:38.750
it turns out recent work by David Anderson,
his colleagues at Caltech,

449
00:27:39.170 --> 00:27:43.460
I'm using the new methods off to genetics that they found that they stimulate

450
00:27:43.461 --> 00:27:45.230
neurons in the hypothalamic region,

451
00:27:45.231 --> 00:27:49.100
the same neurons control copulation and aggression.

452
00:27:49.490 --> 00:27:51.380
And they use a,
uh,

453
00:27:51.740 --> 00:27:55.910
a laser fiber optic laser to stimulate these neurons and they can switch the

454
00:27:55.920 --> 00:28:00.530
flip of a switch,
make this mouse go from meeting to fighting.

455
00:28:01.160 --> 00:28:05.510
Um,
so that's interesting.
So in conclusion,
I want to say that,
um,

456
00:28:06.230 --> 00:28:08.870
you know,
understanding is the first step in controlling anything.

457
00:28:08.900 --> 00:28:12.030
So I hope that people can understand,
um,

458
00:28:12.110 --> 00:28:16.340
that we all have the circuitry how it works,
that it's amazingly,
uh,

459
00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:18.230
intricate and elaborate circuit.

460
00:28:18.470 --> 00:28:23.470
I hope that people can benefit from understanding how it can misfire and that we

461
00:28:24.201 --> 00:28:27.670
do need better ways to,
to control aggression.
Uh,

462
00:28:27.770 --> 00:28:32.330
and particularly these days when we have so much aggression,
that is,
you know,

463
00:28:32.331 --> 00:28:33.740
the police are always looking for a motive.

464
00:28:33.741 --> 00:28:37.040
I understand what they say when looking for a motive,
but there is no motive.

465
00:28:37.041 --> 00:28:40.970
It's a rage induced,
uh,
violence.

466
00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:44.690
And that's what I hope that we can begin to understand by getting a neuroscience

467
00:28:44.691 --> 00:28:49.490
perspective to go along with the perspective of psychology and behavior.

468
00:28:49.910 --> 00:28:53.540
So that's it for why we snap.
Thank you.

469
00:28:54.670 --> 00:28:56.720
Now for something completely different,

470
00:29:02.120 --> 00:29:04.040
I have to go to my second talk.

471
00:29:10.070 --> 00:29:12.950
I'll tell you that either of these talks is over an hour and the Q and a is the

472
00:29:12.951 --> 00:29:17.390
best part,
but we just don't have time.
So let's talk about the other brain.

473
00:29:18.050 --> 00:29:21.560
Um,
throughout my career I've studied how neurons are wired together and

474
00:29:21.561 --> 00:29:22.394
development,

475
00:29:22.430 --> 00:29:25.760
how these change the strength of their synaptic connections through experience

476
00:29:25.761 --> 00:29:27.050
and how we store memories.

477
00:29:27.410 --> 00:29:30.590
But did you know that only 15% of the cells in your brain are neurons?

478
00:29:32.030 --> 00:29:36.560
What are the other 85%?
Well,
they're called Gloria.
The word means glue.

479
00:29:37.040 --> 00:29:39.590
And that's how they've been regarded as just packing material.

480
00:29:40.130 --> 00:29:43.600
Gallia do fire electrical impulses.

481
00:29:44.330 --> 00:29:47.200
And so they're considered the cellular domestic servants of neurons.

482
00:29:47.290 --> 00:29:51.100
They clean up after neurons or he moved neurotransmitters and maintain the ionic

483
00:29:51.101 --> 00:29:55.240
balance.
They certainly respond to injury and disease.
But in recent years,

484
00:29:55.241 --> 00:30:00.241
neuroscientists have come to realize that these cells do far more than anyone

485
00:30:00.251 --> 00:30:02.710
expected.
Excuse me,
I'm trying to stay on time.

486
00:30:03.990 --> 00:30:07.720
These cells do far more than anyone ever expected.
In fact,
they're involved.

487
00:30:07.721 --> 00:30:11.290
Glee are involved in every aspect of brain function in health and disease.

488
00:30:11.980 --> 00:30:15.760
And they're overturning our central assumption about how the brain works.

489
00:30:16.420 --> 00:30:19.450
So this is what I call the other brain.
It's an exciting new frontier.

490
00:30:19.810 --> 00:30:21.970
It was science.
It's only now being explored.

491
00:30:21.971 --> 00:30:25.870
So I want to describe to you the major kinds of glial cells tell you some of the

492
00:30:25.871 --> 00:30:29.860
things they do.
I'm going to have to skip a lot of things.
They do,
um,

493
00:30:30.490 --> 00:30:34.520
hit the high points and,
um,
some of this works from my lab,
uh,

494
00:30:34.540 --> 00:30:37.960
but most of it comes from discoveries from around the world.
And,
uh,

495
00:30:37.961 --> 00:30:42.130
I'm speaking here today in a personal capacity and not representing in an

496
00:30:42.131 --> 00:30:44.410
official way the NIH at all.
Uh,

497
00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:48.340
but first let's trace back to the roots and the story and try to understand how

498
00:30:48.341 --> 00:30:52.240
we could have overlooked half the brain,
especially brain scientists.

499
00:30:53.080 --> 00:30:56.920
So this is the object of our fascination.
You know,
all our thoughts,

500
00:30:56.921 --> 00:31:01.540
our intellect or emotions,
our compassion,
hate reasoning,
perceptions,
creativity,

501
00:31:01.541 --> 00:31:05.170
music,
art,
everything comes out of this bodily organ,

502
00:31:05.740 --> 00:31:09.880
our unconscious automatic responses or respiration control,
temperature,

503
00:31:10.090 --> 00:31:13.840
temperature control,
um,
kinds of things.

504
00:31:13.841 --> 00:31:15.990
I was just talking about threat detection,

505
00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:20.620
our personality and our identity.
Um,
our,

506
00:31:20.890 --> 00:31:22.630
our memories,
our cycles of sleep,

507
00:31:22.810 --> 00:31:27.810
all of this comes from two and a half pounds of flesh that can think you have to

508
00:31:28.871 --> 00:31:31.570
look at it.
We don't have an idea how it does any of those things.

509
00:31:34.060 --> 00:31:35.410
And the reason is,

510
00:31:35.411 --> 00:31:38.800
is that the working parts of the brain are so concentrated and you my new,

511
00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:41.200
they're invisible to the human eye.

512
00:31:41.680 --> 00:31:45.400
Yet our fundamental idea about how the brain works,

513
00:31:45.401 --> 00:31:46.960
it hasn't changed in a hundred years.

514
00:31:47.770 --> 00:31:51.820
We're so accustomed to this analogy of the brain working as electronic circuit

515
00:31:51.900 --> 00:31:55.210
that is difficult for us to think that it might operate in any other way.

516
00:31:55.240 --> 00:31:56.073
But it could.

517
00:31:56.560 --> 00:31:59.440
And it's hard for us to realize that when this electric circuit analogy was

518
00:31:59.441 --> 00:32:02.080
proposed,
it was seen as revolutionary and controversial.

519
00:32:02.470 --> 00:32:06.130
So our understanding of how the brain works is based on the Italian

520
00:32:06.131 --> 00:32:06.964
neuroscientist,

521
00:32:06.970 --> 00:32:11.590
a Golgi who developed a staining method allowed us for the first time to see

522
00:32:11.591 --> 00:32:14.800
neurons.
And you imagine their excitement when they look these exquisite cells,

523
00:32:14.801 --> 00:32:19.270
unlike anything else in the body.
Ramonica hall looking at the same tissue,

524
00:32:19.271 --> 00:32:23.440
using the same method method,
saw something entirely different goals.

525
00:32:23.440 --> 00:32:26.470
You saw that neurons are connected into a hydraulic network.

526
00:32:26.530 --> 00:32:28.600
Hydraulics was the most advanced science of the day.

527
00:32:28.630 --> 00:32:31.930
That's why probably we think of the brain working like in computer today cause

528
00:32:31.931 --> 00:32:35.470
that's the most advanced science.
But he saw it is hydraulics.

529
00:32:35.500 --> 00:32:40.190
All of these pathways are hooked together.
But,
um,
[inaudible] was,

530
00:32:40.280 --> 00:32:44.220
was an artist before he was a scientist and he had an ability to deter,

531
00:32:44.270 --> 00:32:48.070
to determine function from form and um,

532
00:32:48.290 --> 00:32:49.910
looking at the same material.

533
00:32:50.810 --> 00:32:53.940
He had a sudden insight that,
um,

534
00:32:55.070 --> 00:32:58.370
neurons,
we're not connected together,
that they,

535
00:32:58.371 --> 00:33:03.110
each one was separate and each neuron was separated by golf,
a separation,

536
00:33:03.111 --> 00:33:07.400
which he called the synapse.
Andy saw logic.
That's what these arrows are.

537
00:33:07.940 --> 00:33:09.930
He realized that the neurons are polarized.

538
00:33:09.931 --> 00:33:12.500
That information passes one way through neurons in,

539
00:33:12.501 --> 00:33:14.240
through the dendrites and out through the axons.

540
00:33:15.470 --> 00:33:19.400
So all of our ideas about how the brain work is based on this idea,

541
00:33:19.420 --> 00:33:23.810
the neuron doctrine.
And that is that,
um,

542
00:33:23.840 --> 00:33:27.500
communication and information processing in the brain takes place by electrical

543
00:33:27.501 --> 00:33:30.620
signals flowing through neuron's,
communicating across synapses.

544
00:33:31.130 --> 00:33:32.390
But in the last few years,

545
00:33:33.500 --> 00:33:36.890
scientists become started to realize that this assumption is not entirely

546
00:33:36.891 --> 00:33:39.600
correct.
Now,

547
00:33:39.690 --> 00:33:43.020
the hall made these insightful discoveries with the simple tools.

548
00:33:43.021 --> 00:33:47.100
Razorblades simple microscopes here he has working in this kitchen.
Uh,

549
00:33:47.160 --> 00:33:47.821
so it's amazing.

550
00:33:47.821 --> 00:33:51.030
You can't even see a synapse with a light microscope is smaller than you can see

551
00:33:51.510 --> 00:33:55.620
today.
We use the most advanced electron microscopy.
Hi super computers.

552
00:33:55.621 --> 00:33:58.650
This is from Mark Ellis,
mens lab and UC San Diego.

553
00:33:58.830 --> 00:34:03.420
In order to study to understand her own structure,
here's the front,

554
00:34:03.421 --> 00:34:08.400
his lab one neuron,
one neuron can have up to a hundred thousand synapses.

555
00:34:08.401 --> 00:34:11.160
That's what these little spines are on these dendrites.

556
00:34:11.340 --> 00:34:14.750
Your brain and spinal cord are comprised of a hundred billion neurons.

557
00:34:14.751 --> 00:34:18.540
I'll have to be connected.
Correct.
Um,
but you know,

558
00:34:18.900 --> 00:34:23.220
this is not a vacuum about our space over here except in our thinking.

559
00:34:23.880 --> 00:34:26.490
So let's look at what the tissue really looks like.
Again,

560
00:34:26.520 --> 00:34:27.750
from Mark Ellis Mens lab.

561
00:34:30.830 --> 00:34:33.020
What we're doing now is going into the brain of a rat,

562
00:34:33.220 --> 00:34:36.230
a electron microscope level,
peeling away a layer at a time.

563
00:34:36.231 --> 00:34:38.630
Here's a blood vessel.
There was a nucleus.

564
00:34:38.990 --> 00:34:43.730
Here are the axons going by the point is only 15% of what you're seeing are

565
00:34:43.731 --> 00:34:47.540
neurons.
And at this magnification you can't even see synapses.

566
00:34:47.780 --> 00:34:50.970
There's gotta be enormous communication going on that were uh,

567
00:34:51.200 --> 00:34:55.600
among these cells that is non snap Dick and non Ronel.
Uh,

568
00:34:55.670 --> 00:34:58.130
and look at the intricate circuitry and you're talking about,

569
00:34:58.131 --> 00:35:02.030
and I think you can appreciate but Kahala achieved.
Now as you zoomed back,

570
00:35:02.031 --> 00:35:04.790
you see that this is only a thin section.

571
00:35:04.791 --> 00:35:07.370
There's only six layers thick of this mouse brain.

572
00:35:15.930 --> 00:35:19.170
So neurons are great.
They have these elaborate cell bodies,

573
00:35:19.171 --> 00:35:20.130
they form these networks.

574
00:35:20.131 --> 00:35:24.690
But so to glean as you go up the evolutionary tree from lower animals to higher,

575
00:35:24.691 --> 00:35:26.280
you get more glioma per neuron.

576
00:35:26.340 --> 00:35:28.710
The higher you go up on their level of evolutionary tree,

577
00:35:28.920 --> 00:35:31.290
if you raise that animal and they're enriched environment,

578
00:35:31.500 --> 00:35:33.300
you will get more glare.

579
00:35:33.480 --> 00:35:36.110
The brain gets thicker is because you're getting more Gloria.

580
00:35:36.570 --> 00:35:38.570
And if that interest you,
uh,

581
00:35:38.610 --> 00:35:43.590
when Marian diamond here at UC Berkeley looked at the brain of Al Albert

582
00:35:43.590 --> 00:35:45.630
Einstein to try and understand why he was so intelligent,

583
00:35:45.900 --> 00:35:50.280
she couldn't find any difference in his neurons.
But what she found is,
is that,

584
00:35:50.310 --> 00:35:53.920
um,
he had more Glam,
more Glio,
uh,

585
00:35:54.070 --> 00:35:57.010
in the parts of the brain of all the imagination.
So that's just an observation.

586
00:35:57.011 --> 00:35:57.841
It doesn't prove anything,

587
00:35:57.841 --> 00:36:02.310
but it really intrigued people that Gallia might be doing more than we think.

588
00:36:03.090 --> 00:36:06.030
So physiologists,
how did,
how did we miss half the brain?

589
00:36:06.031 --> 00:36:10.160
What we use the wrong tools.
Physiologists,
um,
um,

590
00:36:10.770 --> 00:36:12.960
use tools to study electrical signals,

591
00:36:12.961 --> 00:36:15.480
but Glio don't communicate using electricity.

592
00:36:15.870 --> 00:36:19.560
So let me invite you into my lab and I'll show you how physiologists study the

593
00:36:19.561 --> 00:36:23.010
brain.
The first thing we do is we just checked out the part we want.

594
00:36:23.011 --> 00:36:26.340
This is the HIPPA campus of a rat.
Then we slice it very thin,

595
00:36:26.860 --> 00:36:31.300
<v 3>400 microns thick in this case so that we can keep this tissue alive.</v>

596
00:36:31.910 --> 00:36:32.340
Then we,
we

597
00:36:32.340 --> 00:36:35.670
<v 0>put this brain slice into uh,
uh,</v>

598
00:36:36.540 --> 00:36:41.160
the Faraday cage cause we have to exclude all the electrical interference in our

599
00:36:41.161 --> 00:36:41.971
modern environment.

600
00:36:41.971 --> 00:36:46.680
We use amplifiers and stimulators so that we can record the weak signals and

601
00:36:46.681 --> 00:36:48.120
neurons and synapses.

602
00:36:48.121 --> 00:36:51.630
Here I'm studying something called LTP where the synapse gets strengthened

603
00:36:51.780 --> 00:36:55.770
during a memory.
Um,
the tissue is kept alive and artificial,

604
00:36:55.771 --> 00:36:59.010
cerebral spinal fluid,
warmed auctioneer oxygenated.

605
00:37:00.660 --> 00:37:05.660
And then we use these electrodes to stimulate and record the electrical

606
00:37:06.511 --> 00:37:06.931
activity.

607
00:37:06.931 --> 00:37:11.730
The point is all of this is useless because Gloria don't communicate with

608
00:37:11.731 --> 00:37:15.690
electricity.
So what broke it open?

609
00:37:16.080 --> 00:37:17.580
What broken open.

610
00:37:17.820 --> 00:37:22.820
The other brain was kids playing video games because playing video games drove

611
00:37:24.151 --> 00:37:28.890
the development of faster computers,
color monitors,
better video cameras.

612
00:37:28.891 --> 00:37:32.970
So scientists graft or all that technology under the microscope.
In the past,

613
00:37:32.971 --> 00:37:36.720
we just use formaldehyde.
Dick's,
the tissue,
stained it and looked at dead tissue.

614
00:37:37.020 --> 00:37:39.300
But now with a video camera on the microscope,

615
00:37:39.301 --> 00:37:44.250
we could look at living tissue and new dyes were developed that work like this,

616
00:37:44.251 --> 00:37:49.050
a glow stick where when two compounds get next to create light,

617
00:37:50.190 --> 00:37:52.080
this led to something called calcium imaging.

618
00:37:52.140 --> 00:37:56.910
We're dyes were developed that calcium,
when calcium was added glowed.

619
00:37:57.330 --> 00:37:59.070
Why was that important?

620
00:37:59.280 --> 00:38:02.910
Because when neurons fire calcium ions come in.

621
00:38:03.630 --> 00:38:07.890
So this would allow us to put a dye in brain tissue and watch neurons fire

622
00:38:07.920 --> 00:38:09.470
electrical activity,
uh,

623
00:38:10.020 --> 00:38:13.290
and use a microscope instead of using a electrical recording.

624
00:38:13.320 --> 00:38:16.620
And it was so exciting when we first did this to see neurons firing,

625
00:38:17.310 --> 00:38:21.810
but it exposed the other brains.
So here is,
um,
the textbook view of the,

626
00:38:21.811 --> 00:38:25.340
of the Neuron synapses always leaves out this part.
Um,

627
00:38:25.410 --> 00:38:27.840
it's really the park comprised of astrocytes.

628
00:38:28.140 --> 00:38:32.280
We can find out what these cells are doing by using calcium imaging.
Um,

629
00:38:32.320 --> 00:38:36.310
and as I'll show you here,
we put a calcium dye in with astrocytes.

630
00:38:36.720 --> 00:38:41.350
Pseudo color sold more calcium is bright red.
Watch what's happening.

631
00:38:43.770 --> 00:38:48.650
These cells are communicating
and they're not using electricity.

632
00:38:48.860 --> 00:38:52.430
They're communicating with waves of calcium.
And watch this.

633
00:38:52.431 --> 00:38:55.190
When I stimulate the neurons here,
it'll look like lightning bolts.

634
00:38:58.280 --> 00:39:00.740
They're the astrocytes responded.

635
00:39:01.490 --> 00:39:05.030
So now we have nonelectric communication going through brain cells,

636
00:39:05.180 --> 00:39:08.900
not neurons responding to electrical activity in neurons.

637
00:39:08.960 --> 00:39:13.550
No synapses all outside the neuron doctrine.
Why are they doing this?

638
00:39:13.580 --> 00:39:16.320
How are they doing this?
So,
um,

639
00:39:16.490 --> 00:39:20.330
quickly discovered how they're doing this and you can participate in the same

640
00:39:20.331 --> 00:39:22.430
way.
Cause the Peter Guthrie along me,

641
00:39:22.431 --> 00:39:27.431
this image of which was this experiment in which they did an experiment to test

642
00:39:27.861 --> 00:39:31.880
one ideas.
Calcium might just go through the cell membrane through gap junctions,

643
00:39:31.881 --> 00:39:34.130
which are kinds of channels between cells.

644
00:39:34.370 --> 00:39:36.320
And that's how calcium waves go through tissue.

645
00:39:36.590 --> 00:39:39.380
So to prove that they made a firebreak,

646
00:39:39.440 --> 00:39:43.010
so they just scratched off the cells here and culture started a calcium wave

647
00:39:43.011 --> 00:39:44.990
here.
And if this is the way it worked,

648
00:39:45.260 --> 00:39:48.380
then the signaling should stop at the firebreak.

649
00:39:48.770 --> 00:39:51.950
So now you can see the same way they did the first time they did their

650
00:39:51.951 --> 00:39:53.030
experiment.
What happened?

651
00:39:57.440 --> 00:39:57.860
<v 1>Okay.</v>

652
00:39:57.860 --> 00:40:02.420
<v 0>Glial cells communicate by broadcasting signals.
They don't have to be touching.</v>

653
00:40:02.630 --> 00:40:07.280
Those signals are neurotransmitters.
That quickly,
it turned out that glial cells,

654
00:40:07.281 --> 00:40:10.550
astrocytes have the same neurotransmitter receptors that neurons have to

655
00:40:10.551 --> 00:40:14.030
communicate it,
synapsis and the releasing the same neural transmitters.

656
00:40:14.420 --> 00:40:18.600
That means that they can communicate,
but they can also interact with signaling.

657
00:40:18.820 --> 00:40:23.300
Uh,
that's caring going on with neurons and synapsis.
So,

658
00:40:23.390 --> 00:40:23.930
uh,

659
00:40:23.930 --> 00:40:28.130
we understand that neuronal communication via the neuron doctrine takes place by

660
00:40:28.140 --> 00:40:31.580
neurotransmitter's going from presynaptic to the post synaptic membrane.

661
00:40:31.790 --> 00:40:34.400
Of course,
there's never anything else shown,
but let's take a look at here at,

662
00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:37.550
and these are actual glial cells.
Astrocytes,

663
00:40:37.820 --> 00:40:41.750
when the neurotransmitter is released,
it definitely signals to the other cell,

664
00:40:41.751 --> 00:40:43.700
but it's also picked up by the astrocytes,

665
00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:48.020
the astrocyte and turn releases neurotransmitters that can regulate it can

666
00:40:48.021 --> 00:40:51.500
augment or,
or inhibit synaptic transmission.

667
00:40:51.501 --> 00:40:55.820
So astrocytes can control the strength of the synapse and because they can

668
00:40:55.821 --> 00:40:59.450
signal among each other without electricity,

669
00:40:59.480 --> 00:41:03.890
they can send that signal to a different part of the brain releases a signaling

670
00:41:03.891 --> 00:41:07.490
compounds and neurotransmitters to control a synapse at a different part of the

671
00:41:07.491 --> 00:41:12.410
brain that's not wired to this part through a nonelectric mechanism of

672
00:41:12.411 --> 00:41:15.680
communication through non neurons.
That's what I call the other brain.

673
00:41:16.220 --> 00:41:19.400
And so this I think is so fascinating.
Here's another picture.

674
00:41:19.401 --> 00:41:21.260
I just love watching these cells communicating.

675
00:41:22.260 --> 00:41:22.980
<v 1>Okay,</v>

676
00:41:22.980 --> 00:41:27.240
<v 0>so we're a hundred years behind understanding Gallia again from Mark Ellis mens</v>

677
00:41:27.241 --> 00:41:29.790
lab.
We don't know the basic things about their morphology,

678
00:41:29.791 --> 00:41:30.930
their really complicated.

679
00:41:31.050 --> 00:41:34.520
They fill all the space between and interact with the synapsis.

680
00:41:34.670 --> 00:41:35.900
And what was recently discovered,

681
00:41:35.901 --> 00:41:39.830
a big surprise is that they've formed non overlapping domains.

682
00:41:39.950 --> 00:41:44.300
So they divide up the cerebral cortex and to separate domains.
We don't know why,

683
00:41:44.301 --> 00:41:49.160
but it seems that astrocytes may impose a higher level of structure on

684
00:41:49.190 --> 00:41:52.340
information processing in the brain.
Um,

685
00:41:52.580 --> 00:41:56.700
you can look at a neuron from a rat and it's identical to a neuron in,

686
00:41:56.850 --> 00:42:00.590
in a human,
not true for astrocytes.
Human astrocytes are unique.

687
00:42:00.591 --> 00:42:03.500
They're even different from primate.
Astrocytes,
they're huge.

688
00:42:03.770 --> 00:42:08.390
One human astrocyte can encompass 2 million synapses and an interesting

689
00:42:08.450 --> 00:42:11.030
experiment by Nedergaard and Goldman.

690
00:42:11.090 --> 00:42:15.440
They transplanted human astrocytes and the mice and it made these mice
brilliant.

691
00:42:15.530 --> 00:42:18.060
They ran,
they ran,
um,

692
00:42:18.480 --> 00:42:23.030
mazes quicker and the synapses,
uh,
and much easier.

693
00:42:23.720 --> 00:42:26.000
Um,
moving on to other things.
Astrocytes do.

694
00:42:26.001 --> 00:42:28.250
Astrocytes are associated with blood vessels.

695
00:42:28.251 --> 00:42:32.050
I told you they take neurotransmitter's,
they'd dump the waste from,

696
00:42:32.720 --> 00:42:34.850
from synapses and neurons into the bloodstream.

697
00:42:34.851 --> 00:42:38.030
They also take the nutrients out of the bloodstream and deliver them to the

698
00:42:38.031 --> 00:42:39.470
neurons.
Look at this intricate structure.

699
00:42:39.471 --> 00:42:41.690
If you could see they're interacting with synopsis,

700
00:42:41.930 --> 00:42:46.670
but this also involves astrocytes and all kinds of vascular disorders.

701
00:42:48.680 --> 00:42:51.860
Astrocytes also control blood flow.
This is from Eric Newman's lab.

702
00:42:51.861 --> 00:42:54.800
Here's a blood vessel in the retina.
Here's an astrocyte.

703
00:42:55.040 --> 00:42:58.130
And he stimulated the neurons to fire by shining a light.

704
00:42:58.131 --> 00:42:59.870
You'll see that here with the yellow dot.

705
00:43:00.080 --> 00:43:02.300
And look what happens to the blood vessel.

706
00:43:05.580 --> 00:43:06.413
<v 1>Okay.</v>

707
00:43:07.190 --> 00:43:10.880
<v 0>Astrocytes control the local swelling and constriction of blood vessels in the</v>

708
00:43:10.881 --> 00:43:14.270
brain.
So in response to neural activity,

709
00:43:15.110 --> 00:43:17.870
you may be familiar with Fmr Rye,

710
00:43:18.260 --> 00:43:22.160
which is used to image activity in the brain that's based on local blood flow.

711
00:43:22.280 --> 00:43:24.620
It doesn't sense neural activity directly.

712
00:43:25.010 --> 00:43:30.010
It's sensing oxygenated hemoglobin and the astrocytes are controlling that lug,

713
00:43:30.350 --> 00:43:31.470
local blood flow.

714
00:43:33.180 --> 00:43:36.350
Neuro degenerative diseases overlooked Glioma.

715
00:43:36.440 --> 00:43:40.460
And now we know they're involved in all kinds of disorders.
Als,
Parkinson's,

716
00:43:40.610 --> 00:43:42.590
epilepsy at the time to go into it.

717
00:43:43.130 --> 00:43:46.220
Brain cancer has almost nothing to do with neurons cause neurons don't divide.

718
00:43:46.970 --> 00:43:51.890
But,
uh,
and counselors,
runaway cell division,
but,
um,
new,

719
00:43:51.940 --> 00:43:54.680
um,
research,
uh,
directing,
uh,

720
00:43:54.681 --> 00:43:58.790
developing new drugs that can target these brain cells is leading to new

721
00:43:58.791 --> 00:44:01.400
therapies to treat brain cancer.
Here.

722
00:44:01.460 --> 00:44:05.130
This one's coming right in on the cancer better than surgery.
Um,

723
00:44:05.150 --> 00:44:09.890
this was a surprise.
Astrocytes and glial involved a psychiatric illnesses.

724
00:44:10.610 --> 00:44:11.900
Schizophrenia,
bipolar,

725
00:44:11.901 --> 00:44:15.820
depression are all associated with changes in astrocytes and other Gleevec.

726
00:44:17.330 --> 00:44:21.110
We understand these are all disorders of synaptic transmission and we treat them

727
00:44:21.111 --> 00:44:24.530
with SSRS and other drugs to control synaptic transmission.
Well,

728
00:44:24.531 --> 00:44:27.710
what's the cell that does this?
And the brain.
Normally astrocytes.

729
00:44:28.330 --> 00:44:30.240
So astrocytes can be the cause or,

730
00:44:30.410 --> 00:44:34.530
or be involved in number of psychiatric conditions because they stabilize the

731
00:44:34.531 --> 00:44:37.500
environment.
They release neurotransmitters and growth factors and whatnot.

732
00:44:38.230 --> 00:44:41.550
In fact,
you know,
um,

733
00:44:42.780 --> 00:44:47.780
the discoveries are often made and then forgotten the electroshock therapy

734
00:44:47.911 --> 00:44:49.350
that's used for treating depression.

735
00:44:49.370 --> 00:44:52.500
Still the most effective treatment for depression that can't be treated in other

736
00:44:52.501 --> 00:44:54.630
ways.
Where did that crazy idea come from?

737
00:44:54.631 --> 00:44:59.130
Of shocking a person's brain and curing them of schizophrenia or depression came

738
00:44:59.131 --> 00:45:02.000
from a lot of slough.
Medina,
who,
uh,

739
00:45:02.010 --> 00:45:06.390
in the 1930s was a pathologist and he noticed people who died of schizophrenia

740
00:45:06.750 --> 00:45:10.440
and depression had fewer astrocytes in their brain and people who died of

741
00:45:10.441 --> 00:45:13.200
epilepsy had too many.
So he just said,
oh,

742
00:45:13.201 --> 00:45:16.770
these disorders are caused by an imbalance of epilepsy and bounce of astrocytes.

743
00:45:16.920 --> 00:45:21.920
So he induced to seizure to try to make more astrocytes and cure schizophrenia

744
00:45:22.111 --> 00:45:24.690
and depression.
And,
and we don't know that that's how it works,

745
00:45:24.691 --> 00:45:28.380
but considering all of the growth factors and functions that ashtrays carry out

746
00:45:28.470 --> 00:45:32.370
there certainly likely to be part of it.
And New drugs can be treated to that.

747
00:45:32.600 --> 00:45:35.730
There are four kinds of glass so far I've only talked about astrocytes.

748
00:45:36.990 --> 00:45:40.950
The brain has its own immune cell isolated from the bloodstream by the blood

749
00:45:40.951 --> 00:45:42.750
brain barrier and these are called Microglia.

750
00:45:43.050 --> 00:45:45.770
And in these experiments by the gun lab,
um,

751
00:45:45.870 --> 00:45:49.710
engineered a mouse genetically so that the Microglia fluoresce green.

752
00:45:50.100 --> 00:45:52.710
Then you put a window in the cranium and stuck the mouse's head under the

753
00:45:52.711 --> 00:45:56.580
microscope and looked into the brain and then could see what these microglia are

754
00:45:56.581 --> 00:46:00.500
doing.
Um,
and then he,
in addition,

755
00:46:00.510 --> 00:46:03.420
he created an injury with a laser beam.
And here's what they found.

756
00:46:03.900 --> 00:46:08.190
These cells were dynamic.
They were moving.
Um,
and when you create an injury,

757
00:46:08.220 --> 00:46:09.930
they were like marines descending on this.

758
00:46:09.931 --> 00:46:13.740
It could be a bacteria or a virus or an injury to,
uh,
deal with this.

759
00:46:13.741 --> 00:46:15.120
So this is going on in your brain right now.

760
00:46:15.121 --> 00:46:18.360
Those little fingers are going around to checking your synapsis for damage and

761
00:46:18.361 --> 00:46:22.950
whatnot.
Um,
glee are involved in infectious disease.
Good examples.

762
00:46:22.951 --> 00:46:27.660
HIV doesn't even affect neurons yet.
There's a dementia in HIV.

763
00:46:27.870 --> 00:46:32.730
Um,
but it does affect a astrocytes in Alzheimer's.
Um,

764
00:46:33.150 --> 00:46:37.170
ever since Alzheimer's described the disorder,

765
00:46:37.171 --> 00:46:41.040
he noticed microglia involved.
And also these plaques,
well,

766
00:46:41.041 --> 00:46:43.740
these amyloid plaques are surrounded by Microglia,

767
00:46:43.890 --> 00:46:45.660
but we now can see that they're eating.

768
00:46:45.810 --> 00:46:49.740
The amyloid is involved in Alzheimer's and this was thought to be just a

769
00:46:49.741 --> 00:46:51.930
reaction to pathology,
but now you realize,
well,

770
00:46:51.931 --> 00:46:55.380
what if they don't carry out this function normally throughout life that could

771
00:46:55.381 --> 00:46:56.940
cause Alzheimer's.
In fact,

772
00:46:57.150 --> 00:47:01.320
new research is showing that microglia becomes senescent ahead of the neuronal

773
00:47:01.860 --> 00:47:05.080
dysfunction in the brain.
It considering,

774
00:47:05.190 --> 00:47:08.790
indicating in a role of Microglia and initiating Alzheimer's.

775
00:47:09.120 --> 00:47:14.120
Chronic pain is also involves and morphing addiction also involves microglia.

776
00:47:15.400 --> 00:47:19.710
Um,
you know,
chronic pain is the pain that won't go away after your injury heals.

777
00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:22.260
Um,
you have an injury to the peripheral nerve.

778
00:47:22.330 --> 00:47:26.520
Turns out that that the microglia inside the spinal cord become reactive.

779
00:47:26.521 --> 00:47:29.340
They change,
they start to release,
uh,

780
00:47:29.390 --> 00:47:31.560
substances like cytokines and uh,

781
00:47:31.860 --> 00:47:34.810
and other factors that make neurons excitable.

782
00:47:34.900 --> 00:47:39.770
So you're paying neurons are firing because the microglia stimulating them that,

783
00:47:39.880 --> 00:47:40.880
um,
and here,
uh,

784
00:47:41.050 --> 00:47:46.050
you can see the microglia releasing these vesicles full of all of these kinds

785
00:47:46.961 --> 00:47:50.350
of,
uh,
substances that excite neurons cause pain.

786
00:47:50.560 --> 00:47:54.460
This is also important and opiate addiction because opiates decreased neural

787
00:47:54.461 --> 00:47:58.900
activity turns out microglia release substances to bring it back to normal and

788
00:47:58.901 --> 00:48:01.450
you ratchet up so that you now need more and more and more.
And Morphine,

789
00:48:01.480 --> 00:48:05.890
morphine.
And if you block the morphine,
then you have this terrible rebound.

790
00:48:06.130 --> 00:48:09.370
So microglia are involved in that.
They're also an,
uh,

791
00:48:09.371 --> 00:48:13.510
another interesting aspect of Microglia is that many people will take marijuana

792
00:48:13.511 --> 00:48:17.740
to control pain and inflammation.
Uh,
they don't want the cognitive side effects.

793
00:48:18.180 --> 00:48:23.180
It turns out that the receptor that is an important in inflammation and pain is

794
00:48:23.471 --> 00:48:24.304
on Microglia,

795
00:48:24.310 --> 00:48:28.390
not under Ron's is called a CB two receptor and this is leading to new drugs

796
00:48:28.540 --> 00:48:32.140
that can treat pain and not evolve and not have the cognitive effects.

797
00:48:33.890 --> 00:48:37.430
Now I want to end with Mylan forming cells.

798
00:48:37.431 --> 00:48:39.800
These cells form electrical installation on the axons.

799
00:48:39.801 --> 00:48:43.400
We've cut an Axon here and half nerve fiber and it's wrapped around this

800
00:48:43.430 --> 00:48:46.640
membrane of installation like electrical tape,
Schwann cells,

801
00:48:46.700 --> 00:48:49.580
spindle shaped cells do that and your arms and trunk,

802
00:48:49.581 --> 00:48:51.780
the peripheral nervous system and these octopus,

803
00:48:51.840 --> 00:48:54.830
she sales do this in the central nervous system,

804
00:48:54.831 --> 00:48:58.850
a very different sell and I want to show you the experiment that got me into

805
00:48:58.851 --> 00:49:02.240
Neuroglia interactions and this looks a little old because this is an old

806
00:49:02.241 --> 00:49:06.080
technology,
but I put dear Jean neurons,
which are sensory neurons,

807
00:49:06.081 --> 00:49:09.530
the ones that sense pain and those and touch in culture.

808
00:49:09.950 --> 00:49:13.340
There's big round circles here.
And then I had in Schwann cells,

809
00:49:13.430 --> 00:49:15.290
I stimulated the neurons to fire.

810
00:49:15.380 --> 00:49:19.520
I used that calcium die and certainly the neurons responded.

811
00:49:20.850 --> 00:49:22.320
But then to my surprise,

812
00:49:23.070 --> 00:49:27.480
the Schwann cells did no synapsis again.
Why is this happening?

813
00:49:27.690 --> 00:49:31.410
How does it happen?
What are the consequences?
That's what got me interested.

814
00:49:31.770 --> 00:49:36.120
Then I moved into the central nervous system because oligodendrocytes or the

815
00:49:36.210 --> 00:49:39.690
Myelin forming cells in the central nervous system cells,

816
00:49:39.691 --> 00:49:41.130
unlike any other cell in the body,

817
00:49:41.131 --> 00:49:45.660
can ramp up to a hundred layers of membrane around an axon through 50 different

818
00:49:45.960 --> 00:49:50.160
processes simultaneously.
Could they be involved in cognitive function?

819
00:49:50.850 --> 00:49:55.230
So myelinating glio changed the way impulses are transmitted.

820
00:49:55.470 --> 00:50:00.470
They accelerate the speed of transmission by constraining impulses to be

821
00:50:01.261 --> 00:50:05.340
generated only at these bears patches every millimeter or so along the Axon.

822
00:50:05.520 --> 00:50:06.780
So they act like repeaters.

823
00:50:07.080 --> 00:50:11.340
So vertebrates are the only animals that have myelin and the conduction velocity

824
00:50:11.341 --> 00:50:12.630
is 50 times faster.

825
00:50:14.440 --> 00:50:16.900
Half the brain is composed of white matter.

826
00:50:17.590 --> 00:50:18.940
The gray matter is what you hear about.

827
00:50:18.941 --> 00:50:20.530
That's where the neurons aren't dendright.

828
00:50:20.800 --> 00:50:23.680
But the white matter is all bundles of these axons.

829
00:50:23.710 --> 00:50:26.710
And by and large people ignored white matter.
Um,

830
00:50:26.740 --> 00:50:28.770
because the interesting stuff was going on up here,

831
00:50:28.820 --> 00:50:31.400
according to the Neuron doctrine,
the human brain,

832
00:50:31.401 --> 00:50:35.690
half of it is white matter more than any other animal,
mouse brains,

833
00:50:35.691 --> 00:50:38.450
only 10%,
because we have so many connections.
Um,

834
00:50:38.660 --> 00:50:42.410
and we can see these here with imaging DTI.
Um,

835
00:50:42.440 --> 00:50:44.900
so I'm going to show you here what white matter it looks like.

836
00:50:44.901 --> 00:50:48.300
I showed you a similar images of gray matter.
Uh,

837
00:50:48.330 --> 00:50:50.690
this is again serial electron microscopy.

838
00:50:51.560 --> 00:50:55.430
I need to make the point that the structure of Myelin is sub microscopic.

839
00:50:55.610 --> 00:50:58.940
You can't see it with light microscope.
See and need electron microscopy.

840
00:50:59.180 --> 00:51:02.150
So we go through,
we look,
this is happens to be optic nerve.

841
00:51:02.210 --> 00:51:05.870
Here's the capillary axons.
When we find a note of Ron VA,

842
00:51:06.320 --> 00:51:08.540
we can trace it,
but that in the computer,

843
00:51:08.870 --> 00:51:13.430
this is only one half a micron distance.
Um,

844
00:51:13.790 --> 00:51:17.270
and then we can reconstruct the structure of the note of Ron Va.

845
00:51:19.220 --> 00:51:22.460
This is understood that Myelin is important and d myelinating disorders like

846
00:51:22.461 --> 00:51:26.660
multiple sclerosis.
Cause if you have a conduction block conduction failure,

847
00:51:26.661 --> 00:51:28.010
you're going to have a functional failure.

848
00:51:28.280 --> 00:51:32.780
But I wondered could Myelin be involved in learning?
And here's the evidence.

849
00:51:33.170 --> 00:51:34.070
Here's what intrigued me,

850
00:51:34.430 --> 00:51:38.780
that imaging began to show that all kinds of neurological diseases had changes

851
00:51:38.781 --> 00:51:41.870
in white matter.
This is just brain imaging,

852
00:51:42.770 --> 00:51:46.820
things like dyslexia,
autism,
Stuttering,
psychiatric disorders,

853
00:51:46.880 --> 00:51:51.880
associated with changes in white matter is these are synaptic disorders and

854
00:51:52.520 --> 00:51:56.000
differences in cognitive ability associated with white matter differences.

855
00:51:56.001 --> 00:51:59.720
If you're good at music or bad at music,
if you're good at arithmetic or bad,

856
00:51:59.750 --> 00:52:02.030
there were differences in white matter structure can.

857
00:52:02.030 --> 00:52:03.950
Now we're not talking about dysfunction,

858
00:52:03.951 --> 00:52:06.200
we're talking about normal ranges of function.

859
00:52:06.590 --> 00:52:11.450
So another important thing to know about white matter and then Myelin is that

860
00:52:11.451 --> 00:52:15.810
it's not done at birth.
It takes place throughout life.
Uh,

861
00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:20.240
and the show here creasing colors of blue and the human brain from the back of

862
00:52:20.241 --> 00:52:21.380
the Cortex to the front.

863
00:52:21.530 --> 00:52:24.920
Prefrontal cortex is not myelinated until you're early twenties.

864
00:52:25.250 --> 00:52:29.200
That's also why the prefrontal cortex judgment,
um,

865
00:52:29.300 --> 00:52:34.300
higher exempt level executive function can't really take place until the early

866
00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:38.270
twenties.
That's when we get legal responsibility.
But the question is why,

867
00:52:38.271 --> 00:52:40.970
if it was just installation,
why wasn't that done?
When you were born,

868
00:52:41.090 --> 00:52:45.140
why do we see Myelin taking place over childhood and adolescence where we

869
00:52:45.141 --> 00:52:50.141
understand experience sculpts and guides the connections in the brain.

870
00:52:50.690 --> 00:52:55.160
So this led to a theory that a Mylan could be plastic and involved in learning.

871
00:52:55.220 --> 00:52:56.540
And I think,
um,

872
00:52:57.080 --> 00:53:02.080
this was a head scratcher but he'd probably be really obvious to you working in

873
00:53:02.391 --> 00:53:06.530
the Internet.
Um,
and this is what we're calling activity dependent Myelin.

874
00:53:08.030 --> 00:53:12.980
Myelin is function is to regulate conduction velocity,
speed,
impulse conduction.

875
00:53:13.730 --> 00:53:16.700
We'd like to think of the human brain is the most complicated network in the

876
00:53:16.701 --> 00:53:19.880
universe.
And to do any kind of cognitive function,

877
00:53:19.881 --> 00:53:23.000
you need to send information from one relay point to another to another,

878
00:53:23.120 --> 00:53:27.930
you know,
in order to carry out this,
I don't know about the Internet,

879
00:53:27.931 --> 00:53:29.310
but I know transportation,

880
00:53:29.340 --> 00:53:32.730
the most important thing is when I get to my relay point,
you know,

881
00:53:32.731 --> 00:53:34.230
if I'm flying to San Francisco,

882
00:53:34.290 --> 00:53:39.270
I need to get my connection in Chicago simultaneously with my connecting flight.

883
00:53:39.300 --> 00:53:43.650
If I get there too late,
it doesn't work.
If I get there five hours early,

884
00:53:43.651 --> 00:53:45.840
that's not optimal.
Has a lot of disadvantages.

885
00:53:46.290 --> 00:53:50.730
We know that the conduction speed through all of these pathways in the brain

886
00:53:50.790 --> 00:53:55.790
varies from a slow walk pace of a slow walk to the pace of a Ferrari.

887
00:53:56.670 --> 00:53:59.370
How did all those speeds get set?
If they're not set right,

888
00:53:59.640 --> 00:54:01.240
then you'll have dysfunction.
Um,

889
00:54:01.560 --> 00:54:05.760
and so it seemed to me likely that maybe functional feedback experience could

890
00:54:05.761 --> 00:54:10.761
change the myelination and then therefore promotes synchrony the spike time

891
00:54:11.341 --> 00:54:14.310
arrival.
So that's how Mylan could be involved.
Uh,

892
00:54:14.311 --> 00:54:17.200
studies and other labs have shown that after learning,
um,

893
00:54:17.300 --> 00:54:19.280
there are changes in white matter.
Here's juggling.

894
00:54:19.281 --> 00:54:22.110
It has been done with classroom learning,
video game learning,

895
00:54:22.111 --> 00:54:23.580
every kind of learning you can think of.

896
00:54:24.600 --> 00:54:28.650
But now we're completely unchartered waters and we've always been thinking of

897
00:54:28.651 --> 00:54:29.484
the synapse.

898
00:54:29.940 --> 00:54:34.050
But now if we're going to involve Myelin in learning,

899
00:54:34.200 --> 00:54:38.610
there's so many questions.
This has to be,
uh,
not synaptic communication,

900
00:54:38.611 --> 00:54:43.080
but action potentials.
How to myelinating glial sense activity in axons.

901
00:54:43.081 --> 00:54:45.480
There are no synapsis.
How would it modify my Ireland?

902
00:54:45.960 --> 00:54:49.530
Would it be important in information processing and learning and just how

903
00:54:49.531 --> 00:54:51.780
plastic is mine?
Then people think of it as static.

904
00:54:52.050 --> 00:54:55.680
So in my lab we do our studies in cell culture.
We have electrodes,

905
00:54:55.830 --> 00:54:57.570
we put in sensory neurons here.

906
00:54:57.750 --> 00:55:01.020
Then we put on a myelinated Glio oligodendrocytes.

907
00:55:01.021 --> 00:55:05.280
We stimulate them and culture anyway we want and we can study the effects of

908
00:55:05.281 --> 00:55:06.840
neural activity on myelination.

909
00:55:07.050 --> 00:55:11.760
We can do gene analysis on the glial cells and see how they respond to

910
00:55:11.761 --> 00:55:12.630
electrical firing.

911
00:55:12.900 --> 00:55:15.720
We can block signals were like neurotransmitters and understand how this

912
00:55:15.721 --> 00:55:18.540
communication is taking place.
We can do calcium imaging.

913
00:55:18.541 --> 00:55:23.010
Here's an all ago on axons that are red.
And when I stimulate the axons,

914
00:55:23.160 --> 00:55:27.180
the oligodendrocytes response,
no synapsis,
not neuron doctrine.

915
00:55:27.300 --> 00:55:29.520
And if I put in botulinum toxin,

916
00:55:29.550 --> 00:55:32.550
which blocks vesicle release and stimulate the neurons,

917
00:55:32.850 --> 00:55:34.500
the oligodendrocytes still responded.

918
00:55:34.560 --> 00:55:39.030
That tells us that in addition to vesicles releasing neurotransmitters,

919
00:55:39.540 --> 00:55:40.051
they're not.

920
00:55:40.051 --> 00:55:42.600
The secular means like channels that are releasing neurotransmitters,

921
00:55:42.780 --> 00:55:44.610
all kinds of mechanism of communication,

922
00:55:44.611 --> 00:55:47.970
activity dependent that we've ignored because we're so focused on the synapse,

923
00:55:48.630 --> 00:55:52.980
our work has shown that electrical activity promotes the initiation of

924
00:55:52.981 --> 00:55:53.760
myelination.

925
00:55:53.760 --> 00:55:57.390
This means that electrically active axons are preferentially myelinate.

926
00:55:57.420 --> 00:55:59.040
So as you're learning to play the piano,

927
00:55:59.610 --> 00:56:02.580
those pathways become preferentially myelinated.

928
00:56:03.510 --> 00:56:07.830
We've identified a number of the cellular mechanisms of signals involved,
uh,

929
00:56:07.860 --> 00:56:11.700
over the years.
This is from our lab and other labs or finding new signals.

930
00:56:11.701 --> 00:56:16.260
The whole point is that we're likely to find as many mechanisms of Myelin

931
00:56:16.261 --> 00:56:20.490
plasticity is there are for synaptic plasticity has just that who are just

932
00:56:20.491 --> 00:56:23.570
getting started.
And most recent work has,
uh,

933
00:56:23.980 --> 00:56:28.000
Richardson's lab used a mouse genetically modified so that it couldn't form new

934
00:56:28.001 --> 00:56:31.090
Myelin and trained it to run on this wheel missing rungs.

935
00:56:31.120 --> 00:56:35.620
And it learned more slowly.
So myelin facilitated learning in this case.

936
00:56:35.860 --> 00:56:39.730
So here's what the neuron doctrine left out.
Astrocytes look at tenders,
sites,

937
00:56:39.731 --> 00:56:41.320
Schwann cells,
Microglia,

938
00:56:41.440 --> 00:56:45.400
and all this communication rich communication going on among these cells.

939
00:56:46.060 --> 00:56:48.520
All types of glio sense and respond to neural activity.

940
00:56:48.670 --> 00:56:51.100
Glio communicate with each other.
And with neurons,

941
00:56:51.340 --> 00:56:53.050
they regulate the neuronal brain.

942
00:56:53.200 --> 00:56:57.310
They're central to psychiatric neurological disorders and Myelin speeds.

943
00:56:57.320 --> 00:57:01.750
Impulse conduction may be very important as a new center of mechanism,

944
00:57:01.751 --> 00:57:05.500
but learning to promote synchrony and optimal flow of information through

945
00:57:05.501 --> 00:57:09.730
complex networks.
Um,
but it's important that,
um,

946
00:57:11.710 --> 00:57:16.030
hm.
Okay.
I had some other things and I'm not sure why there is that,
um,
you know,

947
00:57:16.031 --> 00:57:17.650
the neuron doctrine doesn't work without Glioma.

948
00:57:17.651 --> 00:57:21.780
I don't think that the uglier work in different ways.
They work on a,

949
00:57:21.870 --> 00:57:26.090
they broadcast signals and neurons communicate serially the communicate slowly.

950
00:57:26.190 --> 00:57:30.700
Every movie I showed you was sped up,
but you know,
if glee,
I did the same thing,

951
00:57:30.730 --> 00:57:32.680
there's neurons,
why would we have them?

952
00:57:32.830 --> 00:57:35.390
So we have to look at gleaned through a different Lens.
Um,

953
00:57:35.500 --> 00:57:40.120
and this offers new possibilities for new drugs and alternative treatments that

954
00:57:40.121 --> 00:57:43.510
were directed towards school.
Yeah.
Um,

955
00:57:43.570 --> 00:57:45.190
and if you want to know more,

956
00:57:45.220 --> 00:57:49.690
this is the book and the I try to capture in this book was the excitement of

957
00:57:49.691 --> 00:57:54.691
neuroscientists on the cusp of a new vision of the brain that completely

958
00:57:55.541 --> 00:58:00.220
overturned a previous thinking.
And I wanted to capture that moment.

959
00:58:00.221 --> 00:58:02.350
This happens in science all the time and every field.

960
00:58:02.590 --> 00:58:04.600
And this is what's happening right now in brain science.

961
00:58:04.840 --> 00:58:06.640
So I'd like to thank you very much for your attention.

962
00:58:08.370 --> 00:58:10.540
<v 1>We're going to take some questions,
we'll keep it going up</v>

963
00:58:12.860 --> 00:58:17.300
<v 2>and as questions.
Meanwhile,
I'm going to ask a question.</v>

964
00:58:17.660 --> 00:58:20.260
So if I understood correctly,
um,
uh,

965
00:58:20.870 --> 00:58:24.920
glial cells regulate functioning of the neuron parts of the brain.

966
00:58:24.921 --> 00:58:28.940
Like for example,
when we see activity in the Fmi,
ry,
uh,

967
00:58:28.941 --> 00:58:33.941
that's sort of the Leah or astrocyte specifically regulating like what parts get

968
00:58:34.310 --> 00:58:37.580
activated,
is that correct?
That's correct.

969
00:58:37.680 --> 00:58:42.150
<v 0>So there is a glare or sensing neural activity and the responding to it and</v>

970
00:58:42.151 --> 00:58:46.740
they're modulating neural activity and they're modulating a also local blood

971
00:58:46.741 --> 00:58:49.290
flow.
So,
you know,
Ephemera is interesting,
you know,

972
00:58:49.291 --> 00:58:51.750
we take it for granted that you can look at you,
you can put,

973
00:58:51.840 --> 00:58:55.200
give someone a cognitive task and look in the brain and see what part of the

974
00:58:55.201 --> 00:58:56.910
brain,
what circuitries involved.

975
00:58:57.300 --> 00:58:59.040
But you realize we're doing that by looking at blood,

976
00:58:59.070 --> 00:59:01.680
local blood flow and astrocytes are controlling that.

977
00:59:01.800 --> 00:59:04.800
But that raises the bigger question.
What if that didn't happen?

978
00:59:05.160 --> 00:59:06.160
So right now I've,

979
00:59:06.180 --> 00:59:10.020
we're talking different parts of our brain are being activated and that means

980
00:59:10.021 --> 00:59:13.260
that astrocytes are controlling local blood flow.
If that didn't happen,

981
00:59:13.380 --> 00:59:14.490
what would happen to cognition?

982
00:59:14.790 --> 00:59:18.540
The neurons wouldn't get enough glucose and uh,

983
00:59:18.720 --> 00:59:21.980
they would build up too much potassium.
So,
uh,
you know,

984
00:59:22.310 --> 00:59:24.530
beyond this importance and in imaging,

985
00:59:24.610 --> 00:59:27.580
and it raises a really fundamental question that I think is really not explored

986
00:59:27.590 --> 00:59:28.430
this,
you know,

987
00:59:28.431 --> 00:59:32.270
how Glio and blood flow is actually controlling our cognition or allowing it to

988
00:59:32.271 --> 00:59:33.760
take place.
Uh,

989
00:59:33.890 --> 00:59:38.890
are we anywhere close to like learning how to regulate Leah?

990
00:59:40.180 --> 00:59:43.770
So like how to regulate the regulation if we wanted to do that.

991
00:59:43.830 --> 00:59:46.700
We are the three kinds of focus and learning and things like.
Exactly.

992
00:59:46.701 --> 00:59:49.920
So we have to get new tools.
This is very hard.
Uh,
and uh,

993
00:59:49.970 --> 00:59:51.410
there are new tools being developed.

994
00:59:51.560 --> 00:59:56.560
I also have to say part of the reason we overlooked half of the brain is the

995
00:59:56.601 --> 01:00:01.520
nature of how science works,
right?
If you worked on unimportant cells and,
uh,

996
01:00:02.450 --> 01:00:04.370
you weren't likely to get grants,

997
01:00:04.430 --> 01:00:07.460
your papers didn't get published in big journals.
Nobody heard about it.

998
01:00:08.060 --> 01:00:13.060
People's careers were really stifled because they work on glial cells and now we

999
01:00:13.671 --> 01:00:15.650
have that problem.
We understand that Gloria are important,

1000
01:00:15.651 --> 01:00:20.420
but if you work on snap Dick Transmission,
um,

1001
01:00:21.770 --> 01:00:23.060
as a neuro physiologist,

1002
01:00:23.210 --> 01:00:26.630
you're not necessarily eager to have that picture complicated,

1003
01:00:26.840 --> 01:00:29.630
bring in another cell,
whole other kind of technique.

1004
01:00:29.840 --> 01:00:34.840
And so the field is struggling right now to make advances to get new techniques

1005
01:00:35.541 --> 01:00:39.230
that everyone will accept.
Um,
and there is this enormous,

1006
01:00:40.100 --> 01:00:41.600
almost a conflict of interest,
right?

1007
01:00:41.630 --> 01:00:44.510
Because if you're studying snapped at transmission,
you don't want to understand,

1008
01:00:44.540 --> 01:00:46.460
you don't want to have to start studying my on Friday,

1009
01:00:47.120 --> 01:00:50.330
but a new tools need to be developed and people are working very hard to make

1010
01:00:50.331 --> 01:00:52.800
them.
Thank you.
Yeah.

1011
01:00:53.460 --> 01:00:55.290
<v 4>I see.
Uh,
it's very interesting.</v>

1012
01:00:55.300 --> 01:01:00.300
Talk about in the snap you said the seals actually to get trained not to react

1013
01:01:01.050 --> 01:01:04.920
like that,
make those snaps.
What,

1014
01:01:05.040 --> 01:01:08.040
so what kind of training they receive?
I'm very curious.

1015
01:01:08.340 --> 01:01:10.980
<v 0>Well,
the navy works on these and he described some of the,</v>

1016
01:01:11.350 --> 01:01:16.350
they had the exercise is to teach them to control these,
uh,

1017
01:01:16.500 --> 01:01:20.070
this aggressive responses.
So they have very specific programs.
I mean,
one was,

1018
01:01:20.071 --> 01:01:23.460
they called the,
uh,
who did,
they put a hood on them.

1019
01:01:23.461 --> 01:01:27.220
And then they take off the hood and there's all kinds of threats around them.
Um,

1020
01:01:27.420 --> 01:01:30.660
there might be a hostage situation or something and they have to analyze very

1021
01:01:30.661 --> 01:01:34.110
systematically what are the threats,
prioritize them.
In other words,

1022
01:01:34.111 --> 01:01:39.111
they rely on cognitive function to break down and the threats and respond not

1023
01:01:39.991 --> 01:01:41.670
just on a gut level.

1024
01:01:41.850 --> 01:01:44.640
At the same time you talk to these guys and also interviewed a lot of

1025
01:01:44.641 --> 01:01:47.880
fascinating people.
We have secret service,
but also sports figures.

1026
01:01:48.540 --> 01:01:50.310
They also rely on their gut.
I mean,

1027
01:01:50.311 --> 01:01:54.090
they'll walk into a building and Afghanistan and say,
you know,

1028
01:01:54.091 --> 01:01:58.170
this just doesn't feel right and they all leave and find out that there's,

1029
01:01:58.190 --> 01:02:00.450
you know,
and it blows up when they walk out the door.

1030
01:02:00.780 --> 01:02:03.750
And that's because your threat detection mechanism is fast.

1031
01:02:03.780 --> 01:02:06.330
I told you that's one reason and it's fast,

1032
01:02:06.480 --> 01:02:11.430
but it's also much more capable of handling norms,
amounts of information,
right?

1033
01:02:11.490 --> 01:02:13.980
We can hold eight digits in her mind at once.

1034
01:02:14.040 --> 01:02:17.730
That's pathetic in our consciousness.
Right?
That's why we can't do long division.

1035
01:02:17.731 --> 01:02:18.930
We can't,
it's not difficult,

1036
01:02:18.931 --> 01:02:21.930
but can't hold that intermediate answer long enough to do the next step.

1037
01:02:22.560 --> 01:02:27.540
Your unconscious brain is constantly crunching an enormous amount of data about

1038
01:02:27.541 --> 01:02:29.400
your internal state,
your external state.

1039
01:02:29.430 --> 01:02:31.200
That's how I was able to do that in Barcelona.

1040
01:02:31.201 --> 01:02:36.201
So what amazed me is that we all have this ability to constantly survey for

1041
01:02:36.271 --> 01:02:37.104
dangerous.

1042
01:02:37.140 --> 01:02:41.730
And so people do learn who worked at high levels,

1043
01:02:41.820 --> 01:02:46.410
uh,
performance do learn to trust their gut and how to develop that as well.

1044
01:02:46.411 --> 01:02:48.630
So it takes both athletes do the same thing.

1045
01:02:48.631 --> 01:02:52.320
I have some stories about athletes and avalanches and skiers and things where

1046
01:02:52.321 --> 01:02:53.310
they rely on the gut.

1047
01:02:53.520 --> 01:02:56.460
But think about the most complicated decisions we make in life.

1048
01:02:56.461 --> 01:02:59.910
We don't do rationally,
right?
Who to marry.
You know where to live.

1049
01:02:59.911 --> 01:03:04.260
You can't make a spreadsheet and come up to you,
rely on your gut.

1050
01:03:04.350 --> 01:03:07.350
And that's because there's too much information.
Too many unknowns.

1051
01:03:11.020 --> 01:03:11.853
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1052
01:03:13.120 --> 01:03:18.120
<v 5>Operating processes like images and a experience is differently from the way we</v>

1053
01:03:18.761 --> 01:03:22.060
process logical information or math.
Computer Science for example.

1054
01:03:22.570 --> 01:03:24.310
And I've notice a lot,
some Asian,

1055
01:03:24.311 --> 01:03:29.140
our readers can basically deliver a speech for hours without looking for any

1056
01:03:29.141 --> 01:03:34.141
note and also like a very genius like at Tesla and uh,

1057
01:03:34.690 --> 01:03:38.530
and Davinci rightly see that invention for example,

1058
01:03:38.531 --> 01:03:40.660
Tesla was able to see,
lay led,

1059
01:03:40.990 --> 01:03:45.990
the deed her a picture of DC generator before he actually did any detailed work.

1060
01:03:48.100 --> 01:03:48.990
And uh,
in the,

1061
01:03:48.991 --> 01:03:53.320
in the past few years I've been trying to kind of combine this can kind of

1062
01:03:53.321 --> 01:03:57.490
techniques and a charter pilot that in computer science for example,

1063
01:03:57.491 --> 01:04:01.000
why in our Das Jack to that unit in the architecture stuff,

1064
01:04:01.240 --> 01:04:05.800
I try to map that to a nursery information.
Like why walk through this?

1065
01:04:05.801 --> 01:04:09.820
I get a lot inspiration that we'd arrange of flowers and the trees,
everything.

1066
01:04:09.910 --> 01:04:12.000
Right?
So my question to four years,

1067
01:04:12.880 --> 01:04:16.490
how can you shed some light on how our brain works?
Uh,

1068
01:04:16.710 --> 01:04:19.120
in terms I'll re recording experience.
For example,

1069
01:04:19.121 --> 01:04:21.850
your experience with Barcelona is so Vivian,
right?

1070
01:04:21.870 --> 01:04:26.870
Jumped his GED car into the taxi costs you 176 euros to your faith from facts.

1071
01:04:27.090 --> 01:04:30.690
Right.
Is,
is so vivid.
It's so you were now forget about that,
right?

1072
01:04:30.760 --> 01:04:34.210
Versus some math formula or some computer science data structure,

1073
01:04:34.660 --> 01:04:38.080
it will be far more difficult to recall.
So how do you,

1074
01:04:38.110 --> 01:04:41.950
if we combined these two parts of bringing on work work together and what,

1075
01:04:41.951 --> 01:04:44.710
can you shed some light on?
Analyze scientific mechanisms?

1076
01:04:44.970 --> 01:04:47.550
<v 0>It's a good question as you've combined a couple of questions.
So first,</v>

1077
01:04:47.551 --> 01:04:52.380
in terms of what goes into memory memory is not about recording the past.
I mean,

1078
01:04:52.400 --> 01:04:55.320
do you want to remember that great parking place you had at target three years

1079
01:04:55.321 --> 01:04:59.880
ago?
I mean,
most of what we experienced during the day,
we forget.
Um,

1080
01:05:00.090 --> 01:05:01.470
and uh,
so what,

1081
01:05:01.680 --> 01:05:05.610
what you remember our experiences and they're likely to have significance for

1082
01:05:05.611 --> 01:05:09.060
the future survival value.
And so as you go to sleep at night,

1083
01:05:09.210 --> 01:05:12.800
you relive your experiences of the day.
And that's when,
uh,

1084
01:05:13.080 --> 01:05:15.780
short term memories get converted to longterm memories.

1085
01:05:15.840 --> 01:05:19.010
My labs done research on this as well.
Um,

1086
01:05:19.060 --> 01:05:23.500
and so things that are novel are likely to be important for the future.

1087
01:05:24.120 --> 01:05:28.390
Um,
you know,
if you,
if you have bad food at a restaurant,
you know,

1088
01:05:28.600 --> 01:05:31.630
you don't need to do it twice,
you're not going to eat that again.

1089
01:05:31.930 --> 01:05:35.680
So there's so emotion and we understand very much about the physiology,

1090
01:05:35.681 --> 01:05:37.540
about how that works.
Emotion is one of the things.

1091
01:05:37.570 --> 01:05:41.290
Novelty is one of the things that converts short term memory to long term
memory.

1092
01:05:41.440 --> 01:05:43.000
Your second question was about vision.

1093
01:05:43.300 --> 01:05:47.900
Human Being's vision is extremely important sense for human beings.
Um,

1094
01:05:48.010 --> 01:05:52.900
not true for nice and other animals.
Um,
and we have an amazing capacity.

1095
01:05:52.901 --> 01:05:54.510
You're right.
I mean,
I,
there,

1096
01:05:55.030 --> 01:05:57.370
there have been studies and I don't wanna give the wrong answer,

1097
01:05:57.371 --> 01:06:02.371
but you can look through a magazine that you've looked through a couple of years

1098
01:06:02.770 --> 01:06:07.300
ago and identify every picture.
Yeah,
I've seen that picture.
We don't,
you know,

1099
01:06:07.420 --> 01:06:10.870
and that's normal.
We have amazing capacity for visual memory.

1100
01:06:11.200 --> 01:06:15.160
That is because a third of our cerebral cortex is devoted.

1101
01:06:15.170 --> 01:06:17.860
Division is such an important process for us.

1102
01:06:18.100 --> 01:06:22.000
I interviewed somebody in the book who was a blind person who's congenitally

1103
01:06:22.060 --> 01:06:26.320
blind and she doesn't have pigment in her,
in her retina.

1104
01:06:26.860 --> 01:06:31.540
And so,
you know,
there's no question about it being,
um,
being,

1105
01:06:31.780 --> 01:06:32.560
uh,
you know,

1106
01:06:32.560 --> 01:06:35.800
malingering or something that put her in that we did put her in that from our

1107
01:06:35.810 --> 01:06:40.810
ion.
She can't see.
But a third of our cortex is sitting there with nothing to do.

1108
01:06:41.110 --> 01:06:45.550
So what happens is other senses get wired to the CORTEX.
She can,
um,

1109
01:06:46.090 --> 01:06:51.040
see pictures by putting her fingers over at page and she's probably picking up

1110
01:06:51.041 --> 01:06:53.890
on little thermal diff distance differences.
We could do this.

1111
01:06:53.891 --> 01:06:57.730
Maybe if we practice,
I mean,
we could all play the violin,
I suppose,

1112
01:06:59.140 --> 01:07:00.640
in theory,
but,
um,

1113
01:07:01.630 --> 01:07:06.630
she's using this enormous brainpower that has nothing to do normally devoted to

1114
01:07:06.760 --> 01:07:10.060
vision.
She can,
uh,
echolocate walking around.

1115
01:07:10.090 --> 01:07:15.040
She has tremendous synesthesia because there's the census get mixed.
She can,

1116
01:07:15.130 --> 01:07:16.550
uh,
here,
uh,

1117
01:07:16.930 --> 01:07:21.930
she can read five times faster than anyone else than a sighted person.

1118
01:07:22.330 --> 01:07:22.840
Uh,

1119
01:07:22.840 --> 01:07:27.250
and he just turns up to speed until it sounds like gibberish and it's no problem

1120
01:07:27.251 --> 01:07:30.790
for her to decode it because the brain power is devoted to it.
So it's true.

1121
01:07:31.060 --> 01:07:33.280
Vision is very important.
And we,
and,

1122
01:07:33.281 --> 01:07:37.180
and people who do have these remarkable abilities for memory,
one of the tricks,

1123
01:07:37.181 --> 01:07:38.860
they always use it to make an image,
you know,

1124
01:07:38.861 --> 01:07:41.050
and they make some concoct some image of it,
you know,

1125
01:07:41.140 --> 01:07:43.510
monkey sitting on a chair that reminds them of something else.

1126
01:07:43.511 --> 01:07:47.590
They create this big scene and then they just described the scene yet.

1127
01:07:48.760 --> 01:07:50.320
<v 6>Uh,
so I just had a quick question then.</v>

1128
01:07:50.530 --> 01:07:54.840
So what advances I guess or in imaging technology are going to be needed to kind

1129
01:07:54.841 --> 01:07:59.500
of really like continue to progress the study of glial cells?

1130
01:07:59.680 --> 01:08:00.513
<v 0>Yeah.
Um,</v>

1131
01:08:00.580 --> 01:08:04.300
well I'm working on some of my labs that allow me to look at Meyerland structure

1132
01:08:04.690 --> 01:08:09.310
in a living mouse without any dyes or genetic engineering.

1133
01:08:09.730 --> 01:08:12.650
I'm using new spectrum,
uh,

1134
01:08:13.030 --> 01:08:16.520
spectroscopy methods adapted to imaging.
Um,

1135
01:08:16.910 --> 01:08:18.740
I think there's a lot of development and imaging.

1136
01:08:18.830 --> 01:08:22.010
The two photon and the confocal imaging have been great help.

1137
01:08:22.011 --> 01:08:26.160
Fiber optic cameras have been a great help.
Really building cameras,
uh,

1138
01:08:26.570 --> 01:08:30.530
building microscopes that are miniature microscopes that can be put on the skull

1139
01:08:31.130 --> 01:08:35.330
and uh,
with connecting with a fiber optic lens into the brain.

1140
01:08:35.420 --> 01:08:38.630
And then we could see neurons firing.
So there's,
that's one area.

1141
01:08:38.870 --> 01:08:43.730
There's a lot of area because optogenetic stimulates neurons with light of being

1142
01:08:43.731 --> 01:08:47.830
able to direct laser beams so that you can not just stimulate,
you know,

1143
01:08:47.840 --> 01:08:50.690
a whole bunch of tissue,
but you can target individual cells.

1144
01:08:50.691 --> 01:08:52.960
Imagine that and,

1145
01:08:53.020 --> 01:08:56.870
and begin to decode this network because you can activate specific cells in any

1146
01:08:56.871 --> 01:09:01.550
sequence and you can record the responses with the camera to all of these,

1147
01:09:01.551 --> 01:09:04.850
this whole population,
things you could never do with an electrode or will not,

1148
01:09:04.851 --> 01:09:08.450
never,
never say never,
but very hard to do with electrodes.

1149
01:09:09.450 --> 01:09:14.430
<v 2>Thank you.
Okay.
I wish we could have more time,
but they're going to wrap up.</v>

1150
01:09:14.970 --> 01:09:18.910
Thank you all so much for coming and thanks to look,
they're legless fields.

1151
01:09:19.240 --> 01:09:22.290
This was really fascinating.
Thank you very much.
