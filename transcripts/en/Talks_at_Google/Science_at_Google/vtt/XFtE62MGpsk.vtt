00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.370
All right.
Hello everyone and thank you for coming today.

2
00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:11.890
Am pleased that you've joined us for a Dr. Alexander Todorov.

3
00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:15.750
Discussion of his new book face value,
the irresistible influence.
Uh,

4
00:00:15.751 --> 00:00:16.830
first impressions.

5
00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.700
The book discusses Dr [inaudible] Research at the social perception lab at

6
00:00:20.701 --> 00:00:24.450
Princeton as well as others in his field into how our minds recognize and

7
00:00:24.451 --> 00:00:26.010
interpret faces,
uh,

8
00:00:26.011 --> 00:00:29.130
in extremely short periods of time and how those interpretations color our

9
00:00:29.131 --> 00:00:32.820
behavior often an inefficient,
inaccurate,
and somewhat disturbing ways.

10
00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:35.700
Please join me in welcoming to the stage Dr. Alexander Todorov.

11
00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.420
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

12
00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:46.610
<v 0>well first,
thank you all for coming.
Thank you Tim.
With too,</v>

13
00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:52.210
I want to start first with the history of physionomy and this is the pseudo

14
00:00:52.581 --> 00:00:56.300
science of reading character from faces.
Uh,

15
00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:02.630
[inaudible] has a very long history with the first documents dating back

16
00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:05.960
tourists totals time,
but it really,

17
00:01:05.961 --> 00:01:09.530
it really got extremely popular dance of the 18th century.

18
00:01:09.531 --> 00:01:13.640
And what you see here is probably the cover of the first Swiss best seller.

19
00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:18.590
It was threatened by Johan Casper lovetre.
It was a four volume work on,
uh,

20
00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:23.270
physionomy and was extremely,
extremely popular in Europe.

21
00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:26.840
And none other than God to help him edit the first volume.

22
00:01:26.841 --> 00:01:31.010
Some of the best two illustrators of the day worked on the book and it was

23
00:01:31.011 --> 00:01:33.590
really phenomenally successful.
Um,

24
00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:38.950
one interesting anecdote is that Darwin almost missed his chance to take the

25
00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:42.080
bigger we ash.
And this is the west,

26
00:01:42.081 --> 00:01:47.081
which enabled him to make his observational in the base of his evolutionary

27
00:01:47.301 --> 00:01:52.301
theory and the count of his nose because the captain of the ship then sell to a

28
00:01:53.631 --> 00:01:57.170
big fan of flava her.
And he didn't believe that person would,

29
00:01:57.171 --> 00:02:02.171
such a nose would possess efficient energy and determination for the we ash.

30
00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:06.590
Luckily for science,
Darwin made it,
uh,

31
00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.350
and he nodded and his autobiography,

32
00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:14.380
but I think he was afterwards well satisfied that my nose had spoken falsely.

33
00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:21.110
Uh,
and this is what the gentleman's magazine was a very popular publication,

34
00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.060
uh,
in London.

35
00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:28.070
And this is part of the obituary of flood water in Switzerland,

36
00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:30.860
in Germany,
in France,
even in Great Britain,

37
00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:34.940
all the world became passionate admirers of the physio conomical sense of

38
00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.170
flutter and the obituary goal song to compare his,

39
00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.800
the popular care of his books with the popularity of the Bible.

40
00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:47.240
Perhaps a bit of an exaggeration,
but it gives you an idea of how

41
00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:50.480
influential these ideas.

42
00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.620
So we may poke fun at physionomy lists,

43
00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.850
but it sounds sense we are all knife is your honor.

44
00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:05.340
We do form instantaneously impressions and react.

45
00:03:05.341 --> 00:03:08.980
And this impressions,
let me start with a few demonstrations.

46
00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:13.930
He imagine that you're walking into a party and this are the first two people.

47
00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:17.890
You see how many people would approach the person on the left.

48
00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.580
<v 1>Okay.</v>

49
00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:24.090
<v 0>I don't even need to ask how many people were project a person on the right.</v>

50
00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:29.330
So it's the clear majority.
Actually this faces were not generated by an artist,

51
00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.770
but I buy brought empirical forest.

52
00:03:31.771 --> 00:03:36.771
This is actually a mathematical model and I'll tell her later how we construct

53
00:03:37.111 --> 00:03:37.441
those,

54
00:03:37.441 --> 00:03:42.300
which captures the consensus in impressions of extroversion and introversion.

55
00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.740
So the,

56
00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:48.240
the phase that most of you are willing to approach is the prototypical

57
00:03:48.241 --> 00:03:53.010
extroverted face.
Here's another demonstration with real images.

58
00:03:53.011 --> 00:03:54.720
Imagine the decent twins,

59
00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:59.370
the evil one and the good one who is more likely to be the evil one.

60
00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:03.350
It's another easy one.
Uh,
the face on the right.
Why?

61
00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:06.840
Because it can actually generate a model of criminal appearance,

62
00:04:06.841 --> 00:04:09.930
what people think a typical criminal looks like.

63
00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:14.220
And in this case you apply the model to the face and southern and the face

64
00:04:14.221 --> 00:04:17.820
becomes a little bit more masculine and people are more willing to pass this

65
00:04:17.821 --> 00:04:21.000
kind of judgements based just on appearance.

66
00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:26.250
Notice that you do have to think to form this impression.

67
00:04:26.251 --> 00:04:28.650
So you didn't pawn the,
well,
let me see.

68
00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:31.530
Should I go with the person the right should I go with the person that left?

69
00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:34.710
It's something that the moment you see the images,

70
00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:39.020
you know what seems like the right response.
Um,

71
00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:44.440
and we can actually test how quickly this impressions of form we've done,
uh,

72
00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:48.600
uh,
many stories and many other labs could followed by.

73
00:04:48.601 --> 00:04:53.601
You can present a face for extremely brief amount of time and then you put

74
00:04:54.961 --> 00:04:56.880
something which we called perceptual mass,

75
00:04:56.881 --> 00:04:59.610
kind of to raise it from your consciousness.

76
00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:05.010
And then we look at what is the minimal exposure you need to see a face to form

77
00:05:05.011 --> 00:05:05.850
an impressions.

78
00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:10.680
And in fact even about 15 milliseconds gives you enough time to make up your

79
00:05:10.681 --> 00:05:13.520
mind and essentially,
or judge Munson,

80
00:05:13.521 --> 00:05:18.150
no different whatsoever from your judgments when you have fun,
limited time.

81
00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:22.830
If you have seen the face for about hundred 10 6,070 milliseconds.

82
00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:28.370
So literally this is a single glance impressions because I movement takes about

83
00:05:29.221 --> 00:05:33.990
200,
250 milliseconds.
So as long as you can see the face,

84
00:05:33.991 --> 00:05:38.980
it's not some kind of a gigantic face,
you make up your mind fairly rapidly.

85
00:05:38.981 --> 00:05:42.630
Yeah.
This impression.
So not only,

86
00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:44.573
<v 1>okay,</v>

87
00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:47.540
<v 0>immediate and compelling,
they also consequential.</v>

88
00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:52.350
It's actually the very first study that made me interested in studying first

89
00:05:52.351 --> 00:05:52.951
impressions.

90
00:05:52.951 --> 00:05:57.951
We are looking at where the snap judgments of running for the u s Senate in this

91
00:05:59.871 --> 00:06:04.580
particular case.
Uh,
what predict the electoral success.

92
00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:09.260
And it turns out that if you aggregate across a relatively small sample of

93
00:06:09.261 --> 00:06:13.910
participants about 40,
who have no idea who they are judging,

94
00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:18.380
we can pick up about 70% of,
uh,
the outcomes of the election.

95
00:06:18.381 --> 00:06:22.790
So if you imagine about a hundred Senate races,
we can predict about 70.

96
00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:26.360
And again,
you need very little time.
He is a demo.

97
00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:31.580
This was probably about 250 millisecond presentation.

98
00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:32.660
You can see it again,

99
00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:37.640
if you're a participant in our lab studies,
and again,

100
00:06:37.641 --> 00:06:41.450
we can predict,
uh,
even after very brief,
uh,
presentation,

101
00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:43.850
these judgments do justice well.
In fact,

102
00:06:43.851 --> 00:06:48.740
the only conditions in which we don't do very well if you tell participants,

103
00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:51.560
think carefully and make a good judgment.

104
00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:56.510
And what this does is essentially introduces noise in their judgments.

105
00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:02.450
Um,
there's been a lots of international replications.
This is one,

106
00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:06.860
uh,
that we did in my home country,
Bulgaria,

107
00:07:06.861 --> 00:07:09.920
where I grew up and where we were.
And it's,

108
00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:12.230
this is the last presidential elections.

109
00:07:12.231 --> 00:07:17.060
And they're kind of interesting because there's a low bar to get into the

110
00:07:17.061 --> 00:07:18.890
elections.
And in this particular case,

111
00:07:18.891 --> 00:07:22.580
we have Americans judging Bulgarian candidates for president.

112
00:07:22.581 --> 00:07:24.620
So clearly they have no idea who they are.

113
00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:29.390
And you can see there's a very nice linear relationship between how competent

114
00:07:29.391 --> 00:07:33.440
they look to Americans and the margin of victory.
Sadly,

115
00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:38.560
the bearded men in the lower left corner was one of my professor at South

116
00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:41.750
University.
So he can see he didn't do well.

117
00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:44.540
This many,

118
00:07:44.541 --> 00:07:49.430
many other demonstrations about the effects of first impressions.

119
00:07:49.850 --> 00:07:53.450
And I cover many of them in the book.
For example,

120
00:07:53.451 --> 00:07:56.480
in terms of economic transactions,
you can,
uh,

121
00:07:56.570 --> 00:08:01.570
create a careful experiments where you think you're interacting with three old

122
00:08:01.721 --> 00:08:02.554
people.

123
00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:07.220
But in fact you interact a king with faces that the manipulator to appear more

124
00:08:07.221 --> 00:08:08.450
or less trustworthy.

125
00:08:08.810 --> 00:08:12.530
And even when you have good information about their past behavior,

126
00:08:12.770 --> 00:08:17.720
people are more willing to invest in so called trustworthy looking people.

127
00:08:19.850 --> 00:08:23.270
What is going on here?
Well,
when we make decisions,

128
00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:26.540
especially when we are busy and we're busy,

129
00:08:26.541 --> 00:08:30.980
most of the time we rely on heuristics.
We rely on hunches.

130
00:08:31.370 --> 00:08:34.280
And in fact,
when it comes to strangers,

131
00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:38.780
the easiest heuristics is sour.
First impression,
you might be wondering,

132
00:08:38.781 --> 00:08:42.550
for example,
to get back to the politicians example.

133
00:08:42.551 --> 00:08:45.950
So who are those voters who were really,
I mean,
first of all,

134
00:08:45.951 --> 00:08:50.951
we collect judgments from students who are certainly not representative of the

135
00:08:51.051 --> 00:08:55.580
people who end up voting.
And in fact follow up with,
uh,

136
00:08:56.030 --> 00:09:00.270
by political scientists has shown that it's a particular group of voters who

137
00:09:00.271 --> 00:09:02.040
gets to be influenced by appearance.

138
00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:05.970
These are the people who know next to nothing about politics.

139
00:09:06.090 --> 00:09:09.690
So if you divide them by their political knowledge,
the more you know,

140
00:09:09.691 --> 00:09:10.860
the less of an effect.

141
00:09:10.890 --> 00:09:14.940
And the people who know most this zero effect of appearance and their decisions.

142
00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:17.070
But the people who know very little,

143
00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:21.000
and I'm talking about people who cannot name the vice president,

144
00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:25.350
they influence and their particular influence if they watch a lot of TV.

145
00:09:25.770 --> 00:09:29.760
So obviously need to be exposed to the candidate to form an impressions.

146
00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:35.130
So what they're doing,
they're looking for the right information,
competence,

147
00:09:35.490 --> 00:09:39.600
but in the wrong place appearance because it is easy.

148
00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:41.410
<v 3>Okay,</v>

149
00:09:41.410 --> 00:09:44.200
<v 0>so physiology and Miss God,
a few things,
right?</v>

150
00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:45.790
<v 3>Okay.</v>

151
00:09:45.790 --> 00:09:49.870
<v 0>One faceless immediately capture our attention.
In fact,</v>

152
00:09:49.871 --> 00:09:52.750
even if you look at a scene and there's faces,
even if I tell her,

153
00:09:52.751 --> 00:09:55.840
don't look at the face,
he can't help it.
In fact,

154
00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:59.560
faces attract our attention.
There's snow,

155
00:09:59.570 --> 00:10:04.240
the object that the trucks our attention so rapidly.
Moreover,

156
00:10:04.270 --> 00:10:09.040
this attention is a company by all kinds of attributions of flux and dislikes.

157
00:10:09.070 --> 00:10:11.410
And you might be completely wrong about it,
uh,

158
00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:16.520
for emotional and mental states and have character attributions and essay just

159
00:10:18.690 --> 00:10:23.320
showed you this.
Attributions are not,
are not inconsequential,
they do matter.

160
00:10:25.390 --> 00:10:25.880
<v 3>Okay?</v>

161
00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:26.900
<v 0>And so we,</v>

162
00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:30.860
we actually have known about the consequences of first impressions in psychology

163
00:10:30.861 --> 00:10:34.160
for a few decades now.
But the question is,
well,

164
00:10:34.161 --> 00:10:37.190
what gives rise to this particular impressions?

165
00:10:37.191 --> 00:10:41.480
And that's what I've been studying for the last seven or eight years.

166
00:10:42.740 --> 00:10:43.000
<v 3>Okay.</v>

167
00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:44.290
<v 0>And the question that is,</v>

168
00:10:44.410 --> 00:10:48.970
what is it in the face that makes me think that the face of truss work here or

169
00:10:48.971 --> 00:10:51.490
dominant or competent or whatever.

170
00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:57.240
And one way to try to figure this out is the standard way where you can start

171
00:10:57.371 --> 00:11:00.940
manipulating facial features and say,
well let me,

172
00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:04.090
I can have faces that had a smile or they don't smile.

173
00:11:04.091 --> 00:11:08.110
And then I can see to what extent the presence of a smile affects the,

174
00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:09.850
your impression.

175
00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:14.020
This is actually in when it comes to visual perceptions,

176
00:11:14.021 --> 00:11:18.150
typically artists of the first who have started these kinds of questions do or

177
00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:19.930
not with the same kinds of methods,

178
00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:25.320
but this is an illustration from a 19th century book by Alexander Cuisines,

179
00:11:25.450 --> 00:11:29.260
a British painter.
And he has uh,
uh,
had the book on the,

180
00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:33.610
what is the ideal beauty and he was trying to discount the ideal beauty and he

181
00:11:33.611 --> 00:11:37.060
dealt with the slight alterations of some of the facial features.

182
00:11:37.330 --> 00:11:42.330
You can have 12 character beauties and then so he will manipulate different

183
00:11:43.270 --> 00:11:46.940
kinds of eyebrows,
noses,
mouth and so on.

184
00:11:47.410 --> 00:11:51.010
And in many ways it's not very different than what he was doing as an

185
00:11:51.011 --> 00:11:52.540
experimental psychologist.

186
00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:59.010
The problem with this approach is that you run very quickly out of steam because

187
00:12:01.181 --> 00:12:05.440
the space of possible hypothesis infinity,
a large,

188
00:12:06.010 --> 00:12:09.570
just 10 binary features give you over thousand combinations.

189
00:12:09.571 --> 00:12:14.571
So you need to construct an experiment in which you have lots of lots of,

190
00:12:14.891 --> 00:12:18.580
uh,
combinations just to be more specific.

191
00:12:18.610 --> 00:12:23.020
If cousins were proper experimental psychologist,

192
00:12:23.830 --> 00:12:28.240
he noticed that he's working with very simple drawings,

193
00:12:28.570 --> 00:12:33.130
right?
He is working with profile drawings and he's uh,
uh,

194
00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:37.300
working with relatively few variations for different kinds of foreheads,

195
00:12:37.330 --> 00:12:39.550
12 different kinds of noses.
Now,

196
00:12:39.551 --> 00:12:42.970
if he were to be a real experimental scientists,

197
00:12:43.330 --> 00:12:47.350
he should have combined all of these combinations and then he would have had

198
00:12:47.950 --> 00:12:52.950
about 300,000 drawings just to figure out what matters in terms of what people

199
00:12:54.251 --> 00:12:55.980
find beautiful.
So it is,
uh,

200
00:12:56.540 --> 00:13:01.540
a task that is not easy and there are lots of complex interactions.

201
00:13:02.350 --> 00:13:06.250
Uh,
typically when we describe face perception,

202
00:13:06.251 --> 00:13:07.840
we describe it this holistic,

203
00:13:08.650 --> 00:13:11.440
which means that the meaning of a single feature,

204
00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:15.310
what you see can change in the context of father futures.

205
00:13:15.311 --> 00:13:18.760
And there are lots of interesting demonstrations in the book.

206
00:13:19.090 --> 00:13:23.590
This is there isn't there about 160 illustrations because it's much easier to

207
00:13:23.591 --> 00:13:28.390
explain this kind of phenomena by showing you an image than to describe it

208
00:13:28.391 --> 00:13:33.100
verbally.
But take a look at this two faces,
it should be easy.

209
00:13:33.101 --> 00:13:35.770
Can you see how the face on the left is smiling?

210
00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:42.460
But it is an illusion.
The ice actually completely identical.

211
00:13:42.910 --> 00:13:46.570
The difference is that in the image on the left,

212
00:13:46.660 --> 00:13:51.660
there's this smile that is inserted and the smile in the face makes you see the

213
00:13:52.571 --> 00:13:53.590
eyes are smiling.

214
00:13:53.980 --> 00:13:58.750
So there are lots of fascinating demonstrations of a perceptual illusions with

215
00:13:58.751 --> 00:14:03.740
faces.
So how do we go about,
uh,
figuring cow?

216
00:14:04.420 --> 00:14:07.780
What is the basis of different stereotypes?

217
00:14:07.781 --> 00:14:11.500
Impression stereotypes without manipulating features.

218
00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:17.170
Here's one way.
Uh,
we can simply take the same face.

219
00:14:17.171 --> 00:14:21.430
In this particular case,
it's actually the same face in the upper two images.

220
00:14:21.810 --> 00:14:26.290
You only differences with you.
It kind of impose different kinds of visual noise.

221
00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:30.010
Okay?
It's a technique that comes from psychophysics.

222
00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:34.030
Now imagine that if your subject in this kind of study,

223
00:14:34.670 --> 00:14:38.350
you will see a few hundred trials in which you have two faces and you have to

224
00:14:38.351 --> 00:14:40.270
say,
well,
which one looks more trustworthy?

225
00:14:40.810 --> 00:14:43.360
And maybe we go to the one on the left or to the right.

226
00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:46.240
If you do this few hundred times

227
00:14:47.860 --> 00:14:52.010
and then I average all of the trials in which you say,
this face looks

228
00:14:52.130 --> 00:14:53.630
more trustworthy to me,

229
00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:58.610
then I actually extract what's in your mind,
what,
what,

230
00:14:58.970 --> 00:15:01.460
what is it that you see in your mind?
This trustworthy,

231
00:15:01.970 --> 00:15:05.990
not as the dis construct it entirely from visual noise really.

232
00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:08.960
And from your response bias,
here's the noise,

233
00:15:08.961 --> 00:15:13.961
slightly distorts the image and then we can capture systematic biases if you do

234
00:15:14.481 --> 00:15:18.410
it sufficient number of times.
And this is what it looks like.

235
00:15:18.411 --> 00:15:20.360
This is the untrustworthy face.

236
00:15:20.810 --> 00:15:23.630
It can see it looks kind of angry and threatening.

237
00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:28.820
This is the trustworthy face with a slight smile and much,
much more feminine.

238
00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:30.393
Uh,

239
00:15:30.530 --> 00:15:34.970
this is the dominant face and this is the submissive face.

240
00:15:34.971 --> 00:15:39.080
And you can do this with any kinds of category where there's some kind of

241
00:15:39.081 --> 00:15:43.190
agreement.
Obviously,
if I show this to a different group of participants,

242
00:15:43.191 --> 00:15:46.440
they agree with this initial categorizations,

243
00:15:47.870 --> 00:15:52.370
we can actually even do better by building models of first impressions.

244
00:15:52.790 --> 00:15:56.270
And you already saw some examples in the beginning of the talk.

245
00:15:57.050 --> 00:16:02.050
And for to do this all we need to do a statistical model in which each face is

246
00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:07.730
just a set of numbers and you don't need to know the details,

247
00:16:07.731 --> 00:16:11.030
but it starts from a laser scanning of real people,

248
00:16:11.031 --> 00:16:15.110
their face in three d and then you should do different kinds of statistical

249
00:16:15.111 --> 00:16:19.910
technique.
You can extract uh,
uh,
some numerical representation of faces.

250
00:16:19.940 --> 00:16:24.940
And the Nice thing is now that I can generate as many faces as they want and

251
00:16:25.071 --> 00:16:27.560
each face is completely determined in this pace.

252
00:16:28.010 --> 00:16:33.010
Now this is super convenient because now if I have participants form impressions

253
00:16:34.371 --> 00:16:37.160
of the faces,
I have one set of numbers,

254
00:16:37.161 --> 00:16:41.670
the impressions and the set of numbers that describe where the faces send this

255
00:16:41.671 --> 00:16:46.280
statistical space.
And it's kind of foremost trivial now to visualize,

256
00:16:46.281 --> 00:16:51.281
to build a model of the things that change in the face and drive a particular

257
00:16:51.321 --> 00:16:54.080
impression.
That is if people agree.

258
00:16:54.770 --> 00:16:58.700
And the one difference that I've noticed between computer scientists,

259
00:16:58.701 --> 00:17:01.520
and I bet they're many computer scientists,
can psychologist,

260
00:17:02.270 --> 00:17:05.840
he's a computer scientist.
You can immediately take the data and built a model.

261
00:17:05.841 --> 00:17:07.310
But if you're a psychologist,

262
00:17:07.311 --> 00:17:12.050
the first thing you want to find out is that people agree because if they don't,

263
00:17:12.290 --> 00:17:16.130
he essentially fitting nice 80 need to make sure that there's some kind of

264
00:17:16.131 --> 00:17:19.820
consensus.
So again,

265
00:17:19.821 --> 00:17:22.090
if you're a participant in this study,
as you can see,

266
00:17:22.370 --> 00:17:25.640
one of these synthetic faces,
you can rate it on a scale.

267
00:17:25.641 --> 00:17:27.920
Let's say one to nine how trustworthy are,

268
00:17:27.921 --> 00:17:31.400
how dominant it appears to you to have another one.

269
00:17:31.850 --> 00:17:34.550
And the only medical ratings might be different.

270
00:17:34.551 --> 00:17:36.440
But they bet that for most people,

271
00:17:36.441 --> 00:17:40.910
the second phase and the lower right corner will appear more dominant and less

272
00:17:40.911 --> 00:17:44.870
trustworthy than the first phase.
And here's your trustworthiness model.

273
00:17:46.550 --> 00:17:50.010
This is the running classwork in a scoring standard units.

274
00:17:54.250 --> 00:17:55.083
<v 1>Okay?</v>

275
00:17:55.590 --> 00:18:00.030
<v 0>So this is some tally notice that we don't manipulate anything APRIORI.</v>

276
00:18:00.031 --> 00:18:05.031
What we'll do is to randomly generate faces where the future's a very randomly.

277
00:18:05.430 --> 00:18:09.150
We ask subjects to make judgments.
And to the extent that they agree,

278
00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:11.880
the model captures this kind of agreement.

279
00:18:12.330 --> 00:18:16.110
And what has what has happening cleared,
zoom in on some of the changes.

280
00:18:16.111 --> 00:18:20.100
Now we are just keeping the texture of the face,

281
00:18:20.670 --> 00:18:23.970
the skin surface and everything constant and we are changing the shape.

282
00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:26.670
Well what happens,
many things happen.

283
00:18:26.671 --> 00:18:31.671
But one of the things that certainly pops out is emergence of emotional

284
00:18:31.831 --> 00:18:36.270
expressions.
Although we didn't manipulate emotional expressions at all.

285
00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:38.100
So this tells you,

286
00:18:38.101 --> 00:18:42.180
well one of the inputs to this kind of impression says your emotional

287
00:18:43.230 --> 00:18:46.920
expression,
and it doesn't have to be explicit.
It could be very subtle,

288
00:18:46.980 --> 00:18:48.570
but people will pick up on this.

289
00:18:49.020 --> 00:18:51.690
We can do the same on the negative fant and again,

290
00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:54.960
you have emotional expressions,
but they're kind of negative.

291
00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:59.010
The face looks much more disgruntled.
Uh,

292
00:18:59.350 --> 00:19:03.780
we can do this money modeling not only the shape but also the reflectance in the

293
00:19:03.781 --> 00:19:04.740
movie too.
You're right,

294
00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:08.700
the surface texture of the face and you can see that the face becomes much more

295
00:19:08.701 --> 00:19:13.701
feminine and now much more masculine when it turns into so called caught on,

296
00:19:14.641 --> 00:19:18.170
caught on word,
you're looking face again.

297
00:19:18.250 --> 00:19:22.530
It can zoom in and
as you can see,

298
00:19:22.531 --> 00:19:26.550
the face becomes much more feminine.
She had the shape of the face is identical,

299
00:19:26.850 --> 00:19:30.000
but the only thing that we are manipulating kids,
the surface texture.

300
00:19:30.570 --> 00:19:32.620
And similarly if a,
uh,

301
00:19:32.670 --> 00:19:37.670
increase the face is in the directions of untrustworthiness,

302
00:19:37.890 --> 00:19:40.830
you get a much more masculine face.
And He,

303
00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:44.820
I can create a caricature because I can exaggerate this as much as I want.

304
00:19:44.821 --> 00:19:49.230
And here's your caricatures son untrustworthy.
And I transferred to looking face,

305
00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:51.990
so trustworthy to looking face.
It's kind of a woman,

306
00:19:51.991 --> 00:19:53.670
which Chris seems to be saying.

307
00:19:53.680 --> 00:19:57.990
I'm so happy to see you and the untrustworthy faces,
this kind of disgruntled,

308
00:19:58.430 --> 00:20:03.120
uh,
strong looking guy.
We can do this for any other judgment.

309
00:20:03.121 --> 00:20:06.810
He is dominance.
Dominance is really about extreme masculinity.

310
00:20:09.620 --> 00:20:12.690
And now we can see on the other side of the face becomes solid,

311
00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:16.960
acquires this baby faced features very large for her plow choice,

312
00:20:17.570 --> 00:20:18.201
things that,

313
00:20:18.201 --> 00:20:22.760
so now we can draw inferences about the things that go into this sorts of

314
00:20:22.761 --> 00:20:26.660
impressions.
And again,

315
00:20:26.661 --> 00:20:30.040
here's your caricatures of a extremely dominant Anna.

316
00:20:30.170 --> 00:20:34.640
Extremely submissive phase.
So as you can see they all have faced for leader.

317
00:20:34.870 --> 00:20:37.190
You can use different kinds of morphing methods.

318
00:20:37.191 --> 00:20:41.750
This was done in the UK where they started with a few thousand pictures of

319
00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:44.990
people from the Internet and you can create,

320
00:20:45.470 --> 00:20:49.260
isolate the faces at the perceived this list truss work you're most trusts.

321
00:20:49.261 --> 00:20:52.720
Work can create a morphing continuum and just like in our studies,

322
00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:56.860
gender changes,
expression changes.
Something that we didn't see.

323
00:20:56.861 --> 00:21:01.861
H is obviously also important and you can do the same thing for dominance in any

324
00:21:02.741 --> 00:21:04.630
other.
You might be

325
00:21:07.210 --> 00:21:11.010
wondering quiet this particular too they mentioned,

326
00:21:11.020 --> 00:21:12.910
so suppose to many others.

327
00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:16.300
It turns out that most social impressions,

328
00:21:16.301 --> 00:21:18.840
most social judgements are highly correlated.
10.

329
00:21:18.841 --> 00:21:22.390
You can really summarize most of them with this tool judgements.

330
00:21:22.391 --> 00:21:26.050
One is trustworthiness,
which is really about positivity and negativity.

331
00:21:26.490 --> 00:21:31.490
Can Ya'll days dominance and you can think of trustworthiness is sort of your

332
00:21:31.541 --> 00:21:33.910
impression of trustworthiness is indicating.

333
00:21:33.911 --> 00:21:38.650
Trying to figure out whether the person has good or bad intentions here and now

334
00:21:39.430 --> 00:21:44.430
and of dominance says whether the person is capable of fucking on this,

335
00:21:44.980 --> 00:21:49.960
uh,
impressions.
But in general we can do this for any kinds of impressions.

336
00:21:49.961 --> 00:21:53.260
We've done it for dozens of them and the many distractions of the book.

337
00:21:53.261 --> 00:21:56.720
He is my favorite extroversion,
which you already saw demonstrations.

338
00:22:05.260 --> 00:22:06.093
<v 1>Okay.</v>

339
00:22:11.650 --> 00:22:14.650
<v 0>However,
I'm before I moved to the third part and again,</v>

340
00:22:14.651 --> 00:22:16.930
I don't have time to go over this.
Then many,

341
00:22:16.931 --> 00:22:21.931
many other determinants of Im impressions that are not simply reducible to

342
00:22:21.971 --> 00:22:23.960
facial features.
Uh,

343
00:22:24.070 --> 00:22:27.160
you can think of all of this is what's this in the eye of the beholder?

344
00:22:27.550 --> 00:22:32.080
What do you see as the typical phase is very important and that naturally varies

345
00:22:32.110 --> 00:22:36.130
depending on in what kind of culture you have grown up or where you live.

346
00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:40.930
We tend to like a typical phases and dislike atypical faces.

347
00:22:41.550 --> 00:22:43.360
Face the resemblance is important.

348
00:22:43.361 --> 00:22:47.740
We tend to like people who resemble people whom we already like,

349
00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:50.560
self resemble a slot.
So price is important.

350
00:22:50.561 --> 00:22:55.390
We tend to like people who look like us and this all idiosyncratic

351
00:22:55.391 --> 00:22:58.240
contributions,
uh,
to first impressions.

352
00:22:58.510 --> 00:23:01.180
Let me just give you an example of a study.
Looking at this car,

353
00:23:01.181 --> 00:23:02.670
we can create this in the lab.

354
00:23:03.450 --> 00:23:08.380
You can be presented with faces and you see a statement like he made an obscene

355
00:23:08.381 --> 00:23:11.560
gesture at an old lady and obviously you're thinking,

356
00:23:11.561 --> 00:23:13.690
well you're not even thinking kid immediately.

357
00:23:13.691 --> 00:23:17.350
Just s intuitively think this is not a nice guy.

358
00:23:18.610 --> 00:23:23.610
And so we can create this very rapidly to make people form associations between

359
00:23:23.861 --> 00:23:28.861
particular facial image and particular kinds of positive for negative behavior.

360
00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:33.190
And then you evaluate tech novel people like this guys here.

361
00:23:33.220 --> 00:23:38.220
But what is the key that all of them have about 30% of the so called bad guy.

362
00:23:39.970 --> 00:23:44.970
And in fact faces that the morphed with faces you already learned to dislike

363
00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:48.620
because of their past behavior you tend to dislike.

364
00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:52.280
And the other way around if they were to be more fit positive faces.

365
00:23:54.950 --> 00:23:59.810
So one thing we can say is that in the absence of good information about other

366
00:23:59.811 --> 00:24:01.220
people,
first impressions,

367
00:24:01.230 --> 00:24:06.230
our best attempt to figure out the intentions here now and from all of this

368
00:24:07.011 --> 00:24:08.700
work,
we can say that,

369
00:24:08.701 --> 00:24:13.701
that construct it from things that typically have a meaningful QC in the social

370
00:24:14.121 --> 00:24:16.040
world,
masculinity,
femininity,

371
00:24:16.041 --> 00:24:20.510
and all of our agenda expectation that comes with it.
Facial maturity,

372
00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:23.750
emotional expressions,
cultural typicality,

373
00:24:23.751 --> 00:24:26.360
resemblance to familiar others and so on.

374
00:24:27.860 --> 00:24:30.440
But the big question after all of this as well,

375
00:24:30.590 --> 00:24:34.400
are those first impressions really accurate?
In fact,
if they were accurate,

376
00:24:34.401 --> 00:24:38.570
it's not a big deal that they influence important social decisions.

377
00:24:39.140 --> 00:24:44.140
But what is really the evidence that this first impressions are accurate

378
00:24:46.460 --> 00:24:48.950
in some very interesting way.

379
00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:51.470
And this is still a large extent,

380
00:24:51.471 --> 00:24:56.471
what prompted me to write the book is there has been a revival of physionomy say

381
00:24:56.631 --> 00:24:59.860
ds in modern days.
I mean he is a,
uh,

382
00:24:59.870 --> 00:25:04.280
this was from the front page of the New York Times,
uh,

383
00:25:05.180 --> 00:25:06.110
the,
in this case,

384
00:25:06.111 --> 00:25:10.880
this was Milwaukee Bucks of basketball team when they had this face reader to

385
00:25:10.881 --> 00:25:13.460
tell them who would be a good prospect or not.

386
00:25:14.330 --> 00:25:16.010
And it's much worse than that face.

387
00:25:16.011 --> 00:25:20.900
Ception is a facial personality profiling technology company.

388
00:25:21.800 --> 00:25:23.390
It's an Israeli startup,

389
00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:27.890
which is actually doing physionomy all staff is generic machine learning
methods.

390
00:25:28.370 --> 00:25:33.290
This a paper that came out a few months ago by two computer scientists in China,

391
00:25:33.810 --> 00:25:34.520
uh,

392
00:25:34.520 --> 00:25:39.520
where they claim that you can predict with 90% accuracy whether a person is

393
00:25:42.141 --> 00:25:43.010
claiming or not.

394
00:25:43.070 --> 00:25:48.070
This actually prompted a blesser Guayaki Arcas if you guys know him,

395
00:25:48.411 --> 00:25:50.980
he hits your vision group,
can Saulteaux.
Uh,

396
00:25:51.080 --> 00:25:56.040
I caught a paper with him and Mech Richard's,
uh,
uh,
which we,
uh,

397
00:25:56.090 --> 00:25:58.800
published on medium.com,
which was a kind of a,

398
00:25:58.810 --> 00:26:02.570
our view of all of the things that go wrong with this kind of research and why

399
00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:05.930
he should be really skeptical about this kinds of results.

400
00:26:06.650 --> 00:26:09.620
But before I get into the issues and accuracy,

401
00:26:10.700 --> 00:26:12.800
let me introduce the,
uh,
again,

402
00:26:12.801 --> 00:26:17.801
the story with the little bit of history because history is extremely relevant

403
00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:21.700
and the same blunders that have been committed,
you know,

404
00:26:21.710 --> 00:26:24.320
150 years ago of being committed today.

405
00:26:25.550 --> 00:26:30.380
So 19th century was to hey their physionomy,
uh,

406
00:26:30.650 --> 00:26:34.980
to Zara,
Alon Brazo,
uh,
is,
uh,

407
00:26:35.630 --> 00:26:39.070
wrote a lots of books,
case kind of founder of criminal anthropologists.

408
00:26:39.071 --> 00:26:41.840
So he wrote lots of books.
The criminal man,

409
00:26:41.841 --> 00:26:46.050
the criminal woman and his theories were very popular in Europe.
In fact,

410
00:26:46.051 --> 00:26:49.470
it wasn't just like populate in the sense of they're popular,

411
00:26:49.471 --> 00:26:52.950
but they were sent [inaudible] congress is all over Europe that were attended by

412
00:26:54.110 --> 00:26:58.620
a governmental bureaucrats,
lawyers,
scientists,
and so on and so on.

413
00:26:59.070 --> 00:27:03.910
And had a specific Gary that criminals for this kind of sub humans.
And Moreover,

414
00:27:03.990 --> 00:27:06.990
you can read this up,
humanist from their appearance.

415
00:27:07.260 --> 00:27:11.790
Francis Galton who is a fascinating character and I have Roy write extensively

416
00:27:11.791 --> 00:27:15.960
about him in the first chapter in,
in subsequent chapter,
uh,

417
00:27:16.170 --> 00:27:20.910
he would have been celebrated this one of the greatest scientists of 19th

418
00:27:20.911 --> 00:27:23.940
century if it were not his obsession with eugenics.

419
00:27:23.970 --> 00:27:28.850
Heredity energetics is the father,
the father of eugenics.
And uh,

420
00:27:29.190 --> 00:27:31.530
he invented the composite photography,

421
00:27:31.531 --> 00:27:36.531
which was a method of essentially morphing but pre digital era morphing where

422
00:27:37.011 --> 00:27:41.040
you would super impose negatives of different photographs to find the average

423
00:27:41.041 --> 00:27:41.874
and image.

424
00:27:41.970 --> 00:27:46.470
And his first objective was to discover the criminal type or the criminal type

425
00:27:46.471 --> 00:27:51.360
looks like,
uh,
and have a look [inaudible] who was a progressive,

426
00:27:51.580 --> 00:27:54.360
uh,
intellectual in the UK.

427
00:27:54.361 --> 00:27:57.930
He compare to the influence of Lombroso to the influence of Darwin.

428
00:27:58.500 --> 00:28:02.640
It was a big deal.
This is like a,
an the aunt of 19th century.

429
00:28:03.130 --> 00:28:06.060
So he sake and 90,
far five book,

430
00:28:06.090 --> 00:28:10.800
the Criminal Ellis included drawings of criminal faces,
Julius threat,

431
00:28:10.801 --> 00:28:15.660
how they,
how atypical there.
Okay.
This was like,

432
00:28:15.780 --> 00:28:19.710
here's the illustration of proof that loan process,
right?
And in fact,

433
00:28:19.711 --> 00:28:23.700
if you look at the faces,
they do look very weird,
right?

434
00:28:25.050 --> 00:28:30.030
But images,
whether they're drawn or photographs can be deeply misleading.

435
00:28:30.630 --> 00:28:34.380
I mean it's like Pawling New York City to find out whether the Trump will be the

436
00:28:34.381 --> 00:28:39.060
next president.
Obviously we'll get it very wrong,
right?

437
00:28:39.061 --> 00:28:44.030
So this is your,
how you sample images is extremely important.
Uh,

438
00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:48.420
a bias sample of individuals will lead to biased inferences.

439
00:28:49.110 --> 00:28:54.110
And there was a very interesting book in the beginning of a 20th century by

440
00:28:55.260 --> 00:28:57.600
Charles goring who started about,
uh,

441
00:28:57.750 --> 00:29:01.500
6,000 convicted prisoners in the UK.

442
00:29:01.501 --> 00:29:05.970
And then it all kinds of statistics to Tessalon Brazos theory if he found zero

443
00:29:05.971 --> 00:29:08.520
evidence in favor of process theory.

444
00:29:08.850 --> 00:29:12.420
But he opens this book with this two images,
the image on your left,

445
00:29:12.750 --> 00:29:17.370
he just drew a random sample of 30 prisoners and then super impose them to

446
00:29:17.371 --> 00:29:19.050
create the average image.
And Yeah,

447
00:29:19.051 --> 00:29:23.730
that was essentially the superimposed images have the restrictions from Harwell

448
00:29:23.730 --> 00:29:28.410
Kelleys and in fact,
this face looks weird as a goring.
Put it.

449
00:29:28.650 --> 00:29:31.110
On examination of this contrast,
it outlines,

450
00:29:31.111 --> 00:29:35.310
shows most strikingly the difference between criminal types.

451
00:29:35.820 --> 00:29:40.260
It's registered by the mechanical precision of a camera and Svu by the

452
00:29:40.261 --> 00:29:43.720
imagination of fun,
enthusiastic.
But then critical observer,

453
00:29:44.120 --> 00:29:46.750
she put it really nicely.
Um,

454
00:29:47.470 --> 00:29:51.820
there's even a bigger problem and this is something that many of us,

455
00:29:51.821 --> 00:29:56.821
including many people who study face perceptions don't think much about it.

456
00:29:57.370 --> 00:29:58.390
A bias sample.

457
00:29:58.391 --> 00:30:02.170
A few images of the same person will results in biased impressions.

458
00:30:02.560 --> 00:30:07.210
Different images of the same person often result in very different impressions.

459
00:30:08.500 --> 00:30:09.820
We can do this.
For example,

460
00:30:09.821 --> 00:30:14.230
we can use some of our methods and applied to a real face just to share in this

461
00:30:14.290 --> 00:30:14.981
example,

462
00:30:14.981 --> 00:30:19.981
make the face more or less extroverted and they can simply use the

463
00:30:20.110 --> 00:30:22.600
psychophysical technique that I described earlier.

464
00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:27.310
Take the same image and make it look more or less trust 40 more or less dominant

465
00:30:27.311 --> 00:30:31.690
depending what kind of parts of the image the highlighted.
This is again,

466
00:30:32.020 --> 00:30:37.020
all derived empirically or you can do something that a newspaper editors have

467
00:30:38.261 --> 00:30:43.030
been doing for many years and many people doing it.
You can use different images.

468
00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:46.840
So if I ask you,
who do you like more on the top two faces?

469
00:30:47.170 --> 00:30:49.240
Most people go with the face on the left.

470
00:30:50.170 --> 00:30:53.410
If I ask you who do like more in the lower two faces?

471
00:30:53.411 --> 00:30:55.300
Most people go with the face on the right,

472
00:30:56.590 --> 00:31:00.850
but did you notice that on the right is the same person and in the leftist

473
00:31:00.851 --> 00:31:03.160
another person it's the same person.

474
00:31:03.700 --> 00:31:08.700
If it's somebody that you knew that would be trivial and the image activates all

475
00:31:09.251 --> 00:31:10.084
of this knowledge,

476
00:31:10.540 --> 00:31:15.540
but actually we are not very good when it comes to processing a fun familiar

477
00:31:16.931 --> 00:31:20.230
faces.
When the face is unfamiliar we have no idea.

478
00:31:20.231 --> 00:31:23.890
So you can generate.
So here's the same people,

479
00:31:23.891 --> 00:31:25.300
but in the one pair of images,

480
00:31:25.301 --> 00:31:29.050
one looks more attractive for more trustworthy and in the other,
the other one,

481
00:31:29.410 --> 00:31:34.000
this obviously works only with unfamiliar people but First Impressions by

482
00:31:34.001 --> 00:31:36.640
definitions about unfamiliar people.

483
00:31:36.850 --> 00:31:41.850
So random image variation has tremendous effects and both first impressions and

484
00:31:43.301 --> 00:31:47.290
person recognition when these images of unfamiliar people.

485
00:31:48.400 --> 00:31:53.080
Now if I ask you to guess how many people are here,

486
00:31:54.010 --> 00:31:58.030
you might be hard pressed.
I mean just kind of

487
00:31:59.890 --> 00:32:02.230
because you don't know them.
They actually only tool.

488
00:32:03.580 --> 00:32:07.420
I'll show relate to demonstrations with the highly familiar face and you have no

489
00:32:07.421 --> 00:32:11.930
problem.
But here,
whether they shaved,
whether then shaved difference in nature,

490
00:32:11.950 --> 00:32:14.050
very different and you'll be looking,

491
00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:18.070
you'll be forming very different impressions.
One of these people,

492
00:32:18.071 --> 00:32:22.090
if you look at the,
uh,
I don't have a pointer here,
but and the top row,

493
00:32:22.091 --> 00:32:23.740
the fourth from the left to the right,

494
00:32:23.741 --> 00:32:27.610
he kind of looks like a skinhead and below to the right.

495
00:32:27.610 --> 00:32:29.110
She looks like this very sweet guy.

496
00:32:29.111 --> 00:32:33.400
He's actually a that social psychologist who works in the UK.

497
00:32:34.210 --> 00:32:37.150
But the point is that you will form very different impressions.

498
00:32:37.151 --> 00:32:41.630
If I feed you a different images of these people and you wouldn't even know that

499
00:32:41.631 --> 00:32:44.420
this guys did this adjust to different people.

500
00:32:45.800 --> 00:32:49.220
There's no perfect correspondence between image and a person,

501
00:32:50.390 --> 00:32:53.240
especially when we are not familiar with the person.

502
00:32:53.690 --> 00:32:56.540
Contrast this with knowledge of familiar individuals.

503
00:32:57.140 --> 00:33:01.980
There's just as much variation in this image is a in the other images,
long hair,

504
00:33:01.981 --> 00:33:04.520
short hair,
beard,
no beard,

505
00:33:04.940 --> 00:33:09.800
but you have no problem immediately recognizing Brad Pitt and Leonardo Dicaprio

506
00:33:10.010 --> 00:33:12.260
and it doesn't matter.
This is kind of trivial.

507
00:33:13.010 --> 00:33:17.360
This is important because it tells us something.

508
00:33:18.350 --> 00:33:23.350
Images do not provide a magic Patrick character in some way they do for familiar

509
00:33:24.261 --> 00:33:27.170
people.
Because the moment you recognize a familiar face,

510
00:33:27.710 --> 00:33:30.230
this recognition comes with a lot of knowledge,

511
00:33:31.340 --> 00:33:35.370
everything or most of what you know about the person,
how you feel about them.

512
00:33:35.590 --> 00:33:38.660
The soul is part of your act of recognition.

513
00:33:39.980 --> 00:33:43.740
There's nothing like that that happens with unfamiliar people because there's

514
00:33:43.760 --> 00:33:45.230
nothing in to retrieve.

515
00:33:45.800 --> 00:33:50.800
And the problem is that with our experience with familiar faces where we think

516
00:33:51.471 --> 00:33:53.540
that any image,
whatever the image is,

517
00:33:53.541 --> 00:33:56.300
a familiar person unlocks our knowledge of them.

518
00:33:56.750 --> 00:34:01.340
We expect something similar to happen with unfamiliar people,
but it doesn't,

519
00:34:02.540 --> 00:34:06.160
there are many other serious problems.
Uh,

520
00:34:06.980 --> 00:34:08.020
let me just,
uh,

521
00:34:08.710 --> 00:34:13.580
we'll wrap up with a couple of other issues on the accuracy.
This is a quad by,

522
00:34:13.581 --> 00:34:17.660
uh,
your crystal fleet timber,
who is an absolutely fascinating character.

523
00:34:18.110 --> 00:34:21.020
And I write about him a lot also in the bookie.

524
00:34:21.050 --> 00:34:25.300
He was the first chair of experimental physics in Germany.
Um,

525
00:34:26.510 --> 00:34:31.070
he's credited tests introducing the aphorism in the German literature influence

526
00:34:31.071 --> 00:34:35.600
philosophers like Vidcon Stein.
It's just shop and Hauer a really brilliant man.

527
00:34:36.230 --> 00:34:38.480
Uh,
but the reason why he was important to me,

528
00:34:38.481 --> 00:34:43.481
he was the one who saw behind the writing stuff Lavato that there was nothing

529
00:34:43.731 --> 00:34:44.060
there.

530
00:34:44.060 --> 00:34:49.060
So he wrote this very critical say that kind of unravel the so called science

531
00:34:49.540 --> 00:34:53.800
physionomically Sansa flutter and Ascii put it here.

532
00:34:53.820 --> 00:34:58.460
The physionomy so horrendously mistaken in wanting to judge people whom they do

533
00:34:58.461 --> 00:35:01.550
not know from sealers or porters,
that if one,

534
00:35:01.551 --> 00:35:05.210
so day hits compared with their misses,

535
00:35:05.211 --> 00:35:07.610
the chance nature of the game would be immediately evident.

536
00:35:08.540 --> 00:35:13.160
He actually wasn't quite accurate about this.
And in the last 10 years,

537
00:35:13.430 --> 00:35:18.410
many psychologists have been counting the hits and misses.
That is,

538
00:35:18.740 --> 00:35:21.650
if I show her face a image of a person,

539
00:35:22.280 --> 00:35:25.160
and then you have to guess their political orientation,

540
00:35:25.161 --> 00:35:29.900
sexual orientation lately,
social class,
you name it,
there's a study about this.

541
00:35:30.320 --> 00:35:35.030
Where'd you get it?
Better than chance.
And the surprising finding kiss.
Yeah.

542
00:35:35.180 --> 00:35:39.240
People get it better than chance.
Not by much,
but better than chance.

543
00:35:39.810 --> 00:35:41.670
So in this particular case,

544
00:35:41.671 --> 00:35:45.180
if you have to guess whether a person is Democrat to Republican,
on average,

545
00:35:45.181 --> 00:35:50.181
people get it 56% not much better than chance where chances 50 but still better

546
00:35:50.851 --> 00:35:53.910
than chance.
And this has been a big deal in the literature.

547
00:35:53.911 --> 00:35:57.240
We see people can do this.
So we accurate after all.

548
00:35:58.110 --> 00:36:01.450
Well with one of my former students,
cursorily Vala,

549
00:36:01.470 --> 00:36:04.320
who's now professor at Carnegie Mellon,

550
00:36:04.321 --> 00:36:09.321
we constructed Super Dump Algorithms that use generic knowledge.

551
00:36:09.990 --> 00:36:14.520
So this is called the algorithm works.
In this case,

552
00:36:14.521 --> 00:36:18.870
in our task with this person sees two images and have to decide,
you know,

553
00:36:18.871 --> 00:36:21.450
man or a in Democrat to Republican,

554
00:36:22.680 --> 00:36:26.100
how algorithms they see the two images and they do the following.

555
00:36:26.130 --> 00:36:31.050
Is it the man against a woman?
If it's a woman,
but against a man,

556
00:36:31.051 --> 00:36:33.540
we guessed it.
The woman,
he said Democrat.

557
00:36:34.620 --> 00:36:38.850
Is it the minority person against a majority person?
If Soviet gas,

558
00:36:38.851 --> 00:36:43.740
the minority is a democrat?
Well,
let's look at the difference in age.

559
00:36:43.741 --> 00:36:44.970
If it's much younger guests,

560
00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:49.590
the much younger person is the Democrat and if it all fails,
we flip.

561
00:36:49.590 --> 00:36:52.410
A coin obviously is not going to do very well,

562
00:36:53.310 --> 00:36:58.310
but how well do they do better than humans that have all of this information,

563
00:36:58.471 --> 00:37:01.860
these generic knowledge plus something in the phase that tells them the

564
00:37:01.861 --> 00:37:06.861
political orientation of the person so better than chances are really feeble

565
00:37:06.931 --> 00:37:11.130
criterion of judging performance.
You need to look at benchmarks.

566
00:37:11.280 --> 00:37:13.950
How would you do if you just use your general knowledge,

567
00:37:14.280 --> 00:37:17.370
what is like the most likely to happen in the population?

568
00:37:17.371 --> 00:37:18.870
Not even look in the face.

569
00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:23.310
And under many of these cases you do much better if you completely ignore the

570
00:37:23.311 --> 00:37:26.940
face.
Uh,
in fact,

571
00:37:26.941 --> 00:37:31.290
in many situation we will be better off if you ignore the faces completely.

572
00:37:31.950 --> 00:37:35.850
Now,
don't get me wrong,

573
00:37:35.880 --> 00:37:40.860
I'm not saying that the face doesn't carry useful information and I'm not saying

574
00:37:40.861 --> 00:37:44.610
that first impression,
so always completely useless.
On the contrary.

575
00:37:45.390 --> 00:37:47.400
They might be useful here now,

576
00:37:47.820 --> 00:37:52.200
but they're very lousy guide to character if you're trying to figure what the

577
00:37:52.201 --> 00:37:55.500
person is like across Thompson's times in situations,

578
00:37:55.890 --> 00:38:00.000
but they do have functional value and the face is carry a lot of useful

579
00:38:00.001 --> 00:38:01.830
information.
Uh,

580
00:38:01.920 --> 00:38:06.920
most of the time it's about temporary states and intentions be a generally good

581
00:38:07.381 --> 00:38:10.440
and picking up the emotional states of the others,

582
00:38:10.500 --> 00:38:15.450
particular given the help of the context
and many other things.

583
00:38:15.451 --> 00:38:19.650
Here's an example.
People have factually done controlled studies.

584
00:38:20.100 --> 00:38:24.580
You have people have a normal night's sleep and then,
uh,

585
00:38:24.630 --> 00:38:28.590
you take a picture of them or we let them be awake for 30 hours.

586
00:38:28.650 --> 00:38:31.560
And then you take a picture under the same standard dice conditions.

587
00:38:32.160 --> 00:38:34.710
And the difference is obvious,
right?

588
00:38:34.860 --> 00:38:38.770
You can immediately figure out who's the sleep deprived version of the person.

589
00:38:39.340 --> 00:38:44.260
Now she showed this to,
uh,
pictures,
two different groups of people.
Guess what?

590
00:38:44.261 --> 00:38:47.710
The people who see the sleep deprive a version say,
well,

591
00:38:47.711 --> 00:38:52.120
this guy's not very smart.
He's also probably somewhat depressed.

592
00:38:52.750 --> 00:38:56.440
You know,
the,
the skin,
the skin is paler there.
Lots of things that haven't.

593
00:38:56.480 --> 00:38:59.530
By the way,
all of this,
you can see this illustrations in the book.

594
00:39:00.160 --> 00:39:04.000
What's happening here?
You're probably right here.
Now if you're sleep deprived,

595
00:39:04.001 --> 00:39:08.860
you're not gonna do well if I ask you to do some kind of a cognitively demanding

596
00:39:08.890 --> 00:39:12.010
task,
but that's not right about the person.

597
00:39:12.011 --> 00:39:15.160
It's the same person and there are the effects,

598
00:39:16.360 --> 00:39:19.360
which at first sites seems very surprising.

599
00:39:19.960 --> 00:39:23.770
There was a very interesting gone to tutoring or study with followed twins,

600
00:39:24.010 --> 00:39:27.520
thousands of twins in Denmark and uh,

601
00:39:27.550 --> 00:39:30.400
looked at Dell and GVT Dennis out.

602
00:39:30.430 --> 00:39:35.080
They took pictures when they were 70 or sold.
Not Surprising kid,

603
00:39:35.081 --> 00:39:38.710
the best predictor,
how long you're going to lift this,
your biological age.

604
00:39:39.190 --> 00:39:43.870
There's nothing that matches it,
but surprisingly 10 sounded the second best.

605
00:39:43.871 --> 00:39:45.130
And in this study,
in fact,

606
00:39:45.131 --> 00:39:50.131
as good as the first one is how old you look relative to your biological age.

607
00:39:50.740 --> 00:39:52.050
So this,
some morphs of that.

608
00:39:52.051 --> 00:39:56.770
A twin who looks younger and the twin who looks older and in fact seven,

609
00:39:57.010 --> 00:39:59.200
eight,
10 years down the line,

610
00:39:59.590 --> 00:40:02.620
the person who looks young is much more likely to leave.
And you say,
well,

611
00:40:02.621 --> 00:40:06.280
what's going on?
Well,
faith is apart of our bodies.

612
00:40:06.281 --> 00:40:10.630
What makes you look younger?
Having a better socioeconomic status,

613
00:40:10.631 --> 00:40:13.210
which comes through 12th and better access to healthcare,

614
00:40:13.930 --> 00:40:16.410
not having a chronic conditions,
uh,

615
00:40:17.110 --> 00:40:20.440
not being chronically exposed to sun,
not some of occasions,

616
00:40:20.441 --> 00:40:25.270
but being a fisherman or a bank of Pharma,
not being a smoker.
This,

617
00:40:25.271 --> 00:40:28.180
all of the things that the bad for your health and they also bet for your

618
00:40:28.181 --> 00:40:29.014
appearance.

619
00:40:29.320 --> 00:40:34.320
So it's not surprising that different life circumstances eventually get

620
00:40:34.321 --> 00:40:38.110
imprinted on your face over time.
There's nothing surprising there,

621
00:40:38.320 --> 00:40:41.920
but is it about character or is it about life circumstances?

622
00:40:42.820 --> 00:40:45.280
Life does leave traces and our faces,

623
00:40:45.281 --> 00:40:49.920
but they need them be about character and it takes a long time to get there.
Uh,

624
00:40:51.580 --> 00:40:52.720
so let me finish up.

625
00:40:52.950 --> 00:40:56.500
And fortunately physionomy will not disappear from our lives.

626
00:40:57.550 --> 00:41:01.780
We imbue faces with meaning.
There's just no emotion and neutral face.

627
00:41:02.170 --> 00:41:06.130
We kind of like to look at faces and we always see something can faces,

628
00:41:06.160 --> 00:41:07.900
even if there's nothing there.

629
00:41:08.020 --> 00:41:12.430
And the actual examples of the book where is not thinking the face that suggests

630
00:41:12.760 --> 00:41:17.040
what kind of emotion the person is feeling.
But we tend to see it,
uh,

631
00:41:17.260 --> 00:41:20.050
the and Burka call it that called the phase,

632
00:41:20.051 --> 00:41:23.320
the most entertaining map in the world.
Um,

633
00:41:24.280 --> 00:41:28.120
first impression,
impression,
surf,
important psychological functions.

634
00:41:28.121 --> 00:41:31.860
We tried to infer the immediate intentions,
uh,

635
00:41:32.080 --> 00:41:35.690
of the others in the situation here and now.

636
00:41:36.680 --> 00:41:40.820
And in many ways,
first impression gives us the illusion that too is kind of,

637
00:41:41.260 --> 00:41:44.660
uh,
can reduce the uncertainty of living quit strangers.

638
00:41:44.661 --> 00:41:47.180
Something that appeared only in the last,

639
00:41:47.181 --> 00:41:51.380
if you imagine human evolution compressed within 24 hours who haven't been

640
00:41:51.381 --> 00:41:54.110
living with strangers only in the last five minutes of the day.

641
00:41:54.320 --> 00:41:58.430
And this is exactly when physio on and we kind of horizons and becomes extremely

642
00:41:58.431 --> 00:42:01.520
popular when you have big industrial migration.

643
00:42:01.670 --> 00:42:04.520
When suddenly places like New York City,

644
00:42:05.270 --> 00:42:08.750
we have to interact with strangers on an everyday basis all the time.

645
00:42:09.800 --> 00:42:10.760
So in conclusion,

646
00:42:10.761 --> 00:42:14.360
we should remember the wisdom of Lichtenberg a first impression,

647
00:42:14.361 --> 00:42:18.920
slammed the smallest possible knowledge,
the greatest possible appearance of it,

648
00:42:19.850 --> 00:42:24.850
and consider someone Weiss walks wisely and do not be misled by irregularities

649
00:42:25.221 --> 00:42:26.720
on the surface.
Thank you.

650
00:42:35.670 --> 00:42:40.450
<v 4>I have two questions since it seems like these impressions and tend not to be</v>

651
00:42:40.451 --> 00:42:42.370
very reliable or accurate,

652
00:42:43.570 --> 00:42:47.130
what can we do to stop people from relying on the roof?

653
00:42:48.760 --> 00:42:53.440
<v 0>Well,
I mean,
so there's couple of things.
You're absolutely right.
Then in fact,</v>

654
00:42:53.740 --> 00:42:57.310
I had a four chapters of the book of Medicare on the question of doctorate sin.

655
00:42:57.470 --> 00:42:59.980
They're not reliable when it comes to reading character.

656
00:43:00.490 --> 00:43:04.270
Now I think that the bad news is that you can stop DePaul forming first

657
00:43:04.271 --> 00:43:06.570
impressions.
There's just a lot of my work is that,

658
00:43:06.580 --> 00:43:09.850
and this is the reason I started getting into it,
what is behind it?

659
00:43:09.851 --> 00:43:12.940
So it can just tell people don't do this and people say,
sure,

660
00:43:12.941 --> 00:43:13.780
I'm not going to do it.

661
00:43:13.781 --> 00:43:17.530
But it's not something that you consciously make yourself,
not do it or do it.

662
00:43:17.890 --> 00:43:19.360
So it's a fairly automatic.

663
00:43:19.780 --> 00:43:24.070
The good news is that in fact if you have reliable information about people,

664
00:43:24.071 --> 00:43:28.780
we change our minds.
So you meet somebody if you like a chill teammates,

665
00:43:28.781 --> 00:43:32.320
I mean maybe you didn't like them in the beginning but eventually get to rely on

666
00:43:32.321 --> 00:43:35.980
them because you see what they really are and you get,
and this is fine.

667
00:43:36.130 --> 00:43:39.790
The problem is when you have situations where it's almost like the first

668
00:43:39.791 --> 00:43:41.980
expression of the gatekeepers,
right?

669
00:43:41.981 --> 00:43:45.790
When you don't have a possibility for interactions and that kind of can preclude

670
00:43:46.060 --> 00:43:49.750
a particularly good interaction or a relationship from occurring,

671
00:43:50.320 --> 00:43:54.580
but generally in how it can quickly override this as long as I give you a good

672
00:43:54.581 --> 00:43:57.100
information about what people have done in the past.

673
00:43:58.330 --> 00:44:02.990
<v 5>Um,
and then my other question is how much do the kind of feature of people</v>

674
00:44:02.991 --> 00:44:04.850
interpreted as say,
trustworthy or untrustworthy?

675
00:44:04.851 --> 00:44:07.160
How does that vary across cultures?
Do we have,

676
00:44:07.430 --> 00:44:11.870
<v 0>it's a very good question.
So there's not enough cross cultural work.
I mean,</v>

677
00:44:11.871 --> 00:44:14.780
and then again,
uh,
oh,

678
00:44:15.890 --> 00:44:19.360
so it depends what it is is like cross cross off on like cross cultural council.

679
00:44:19.361 --> 00:44:21.770
If you go to Asia in or you go to Japan,

680
00:44:21.771 --> 00:44:25.010
you know and do a study and in China and then in the United saying that's cross

681
00:44:25.011 --> 00:44:28.730
cultural,
but it's not that really a cross cultural,

682
00:44:28.731 --> 00:44:30.830
you need to go to a small scale,

683
00:44:31.480 --> 00:44:34.860
lone industrialized societies and look at this kinds of effects.

684
00:44:35.220 --> 00:44:38.640
What do we know from some of the work we have done is that cultural typicality

685
00:44:38.641 --> 00:44:39.360
matters.

686
00:44:39.360 --> 00:44:43.530
But you can think this is and in addition to this kind of facial futures,

687
00:44:44.340 --> 00:44:44.671
you know,

688
00:44:44.671 --> 00:44:49.020
convey emotional meaning can even even like the emotions might vary in different

689
00:44:49.021 --> 00:44:49.441
cultures.

690
00:44:49.441 --> 00:44:54.441
For example in the United States and many European countries,

691
00:44:54.451 --> 00:44:58.080
the smallest kind of a way of you can approach me,

692
00:44:58.650 --> 00:45:03.150
but in many Asian culture is kind of a sign of submissiveness.

693
00:45:03.540 --> 00:45:08.540
And the people who have a lower social status are more likely to smile and

694
00:45:08.641 --> 00:45:12.500
communicate different things.
And this apparently correlates with,
you know,

695
00:45:12.570 --> 00:45:15.200
how heterogeneous the societies,
because you know,

696
00:45:15.210 --> 00:45:18.270
in the United States a culture where it's basically a culture,

697
00:45:18.271 --> 00:45:20.370
FEMA grants and there's a way to communicate.

698
00:45:20.371 --> 00:45:22.650
So even this can change from culture to culture.

699
00:45:22.651 --> 00:45:25.830
So culture is extremely important.
Thanks.

700
00:45:29.090 --> 00:45:32.220
<v 6>Hi.
Thanks for coming in today.
Sure.
You write your book.
Um,</v>

701
00:45:32.540 --> 00:45:35.480
I noticed you talked a lot about what people's first impressions are,

702
00:45:35.481 --> 00:45:39.160
but not a lot of like why they're feeling that way.
Um,
you know,

703
00:45:39.170 --> 00:45:43.600
if it's evolutionary or if it's a learned behavior or,
you know,

704
00:45:43.640 --> 00:45:46.160
why are women viewed as more trustworthy,
things like that.

705
00:45:46.610 --> 00:45:50.180
<v 0>Yeah,
I mean,
it's a,
it's a,
it's a very good question.
I have a,</v>

706
00:45:50.630 --> 00:45:52.550
I have a whole chapter called devolution.

707
00:45:52.551 --> 00:45:55.370
That restore is where I look at what's the bad and quote.
In fact,

708
00:45:56.100 --> 00:46:00.860
some of this evolutionary theories can explain some of the data.

709
00:46:00.861 --> 00:46:04.670
And,
uh,
my reading is not really,
I mean,

710
00:46:04.671 --> 00:46:08.810
a lot of this has to do well.
The men tend to be physically stronger to,

711
00:46:08.870 --> 00:46:11.540
and dominance is about physical strengths for sure.

712
00:46:11.541 --> 00:46:13.760
So there's some kind of biological underpinning,

713
00:46:14.180 --> 00:46:18.290
but you don't need to even see it in the face.
It's actually in the body.

714
00:46:18.350 --> 00:46:19.430
So for example,

715
00:46:19.431 --> 00:46:23.750
there's been a really lousy measure in psychology that people have used 10 use,

716
00:46:23.751 --> 00:46:28.010
10 use.
It's called the width to height ratio,
the width to height ratio,

717
00:46:28.011 --> 00:46:31.800
essentially the ratio of the width of your face to your heightened they days,

718
00:46:31.820 --> 00:46:35.840
the high disc ratio,
the more physically strong care,
but not only that,

719
00:46:35.841 --> 00:46:38.600
but you're more aggressive with the saunas and this kind of stuff.

720
00:46:39.260 --> 00:46:41.740
And it was interesting [inaudible] uh,

721
00:46:41.820 --> 00:46:45.290
the original interpretation that you'd sexually dimorphic various.

722
00:46:45.800 --> 00:46:49.730
It's only matters for men and men have a higher ratio than women.

723
00:46:50.270 --> 00:46:51.103
In fact,

724
00:46:51.260 --> 00:46:56.120
some people look at Carlson thousand and thousands of participants and it turns

725
00:46:56.121 --> 00:47:01.121
out that in fact the correlations between gender and this ratio is 0.05,

726
00:47:02.030 --> 00:47:05.030
so it's practically zero.
So the whole evolutionary Jerry,

727
00:47:05.031 --> 00:47:10.031
you have to Troy and discard it straight from the now and in real interactions.

728
00:47:10.131 --> 00:47:14.990
And the other hand you feel a body and uh,
you know,
body weight,
body hide,

729
00:47:14.991 --> 00:47:19.340
the correlations tend to be between point 30 point 60 and the correlation with

730
00:47:19.341 --> 00:47:22.070
top of body strength and gender,
it's about point 80.

731
00:47:22.460 --> 00:47:25.970
So this accused that easily available.
You don't need to look at the face.

732
00:47:26.180 --> 00:47:30.330
People can tell from the face your weight,
but guess what?
Larger bodies,

733
00:47:30.340 --> 00:47:31.780
comic launch of faces.

734
00:47:32.080 --> 00:47:35.620
So I mean when it comes to the appearance from the face,

735
00:47:35.621 --> 00:47:37.120
I don't see there's much bearing.

736
00:47:37.200 --> 00:47:40.870
That doesn't mean that evolution didn't play a role.
Um,

737
00:47:41.710 --> 00:47:46.210
have you had the only hairless primates that actually makes the detection of

738
00:47:46.211 --> 00:47:48.610
emotion and changes in the skin?
Very easy.

739
00:47:48.611 --> 00:47:53.440
We also only Momma Steph trichromatic vision seeing Keno in the three basic

740
00:47:53.441 --> 00:47:55.450
colors and not all mammals have it.

741
00:47:55.840 --> 00:48:00.100
And this would couple with our best skin face makes it very easy to detect the

742
00:48:00.110 --> 00:48:02.540
blushing and other kinds of things that uh,

743
00:48:02.620 --> 00:48:04.990
sickness and other things that are important.

744
00:48:05.350 --> 00:48:09.640
We also are the only prime met with,
uh,
whites of the eye,

745
00:48:10.120 --> 00:48:13.680
which makes the detection of Phi gay stupid easy.
Uh,

746
00:48:13.730 --> 00:48:18.250
we have the most delegated,
uh,
ice to begin with.

747
00:48:18.251 --> 00:48:21.270
But that generally is true for all primary school if on the ground because

748
00:48:21.350 --> 00:48:21.941
evolutionary,

749
00:48:21.941 --> 00:48:26.520
it's more efficient to scan the environment rather than turning my whole body on

750
00:48:26.521 --> 00:48:31.240
my head just to scan with my ice and I need to scan horizontally and
interesting,

751
00:48:31.241 --> 00:48:34.780
clear from all of the prime.
It started to add your new one with the whites,

752
00:48:34.810 --> 00:48:37.390
which makes detection of Phi Gates very easy.

753
00:48:37.780 --> 00:48:40.690
And I guess it's important because I can attract your attention.

754
00:48:40.691 --> 00:48:42.310
We can communicate from a distance.

755
00:48:42.311 --> 00:48:47.020
So there are lots of things to be said about the importance of communicating cow

756
00:48:47.021 --> 00:48:52.021
emotional and mental states that the link to comparative changes in facial

757
00:48:52.181 --> 00:48:53.014
appearance.

758
00:48:53.290 --> 00:48:57.310
But I don't see much that could be say that in fact your face is sort of a

759
00:48:58.420 --> 00:49:03.040
imprint of your character from evolutionary point of view and any other point of

760
00:49:03.041 --> 00:49:07.660
view.
And a lot of this is learning can emotions.
Like obviously we'll be,

761
00:49:07.900 --> 00:49:10.900
we'll have a relatively constrained meanings of this.

762
00:49:10.901 --> 00:49:14.470
The things that you will learn and they will be important and they would be fine

763
00:49:14.471 --> 00:49:16.390
here and now my argument is,

764
00:49:16.391 --> 00:49:19.480
but don't take this as this is what the person is like.

765
00:49:20.240 --> 00:49:23.580
<v 7>I was just curious if the mechanisms that we use to I guess,</v>

766
00:49:23.610 --> 00:49:27.780
judge character based on face incorrectly or they actually very useful for some

767
00:49:27.781 --> 00:49:30.890
other tasks and we're just misusing them by,
uh,

768
00:49:31.650 --> 00:49:33.030
by judging character with them?

769
00:49:33.031 --> 00:49:36.680
Or is it just a standalone thing that we shouldn't be using it?

770
00:49:37.430 --> 00:49:41.780
<v 0>Well,
I think that I'm in perception is amazing.
Come in,
we are right.
You know,</v>

771
00:49:41.810 --> 00:49:43.610
if you look at the prime,
my brain,

772
00:49:44.330 --> 00:49:47.000
more than half of our brain is dedicated to vision.

773
00:49:47.001 --> 00:49:49.910
So we extremely visual creatures and we make very quick,

774
00:49:49.940 --> 00:49:52.410
very quick rapid judgements.
So we usually,
I mean we,
um,

775
00:49:52.550 --> 00:49:55.970
I mean it's funny because in face recognition until five,

776
00:49:55.971 --> 00:49:58.850
six years ago we'll say,
you know,
the,

777
00:49:58.910 --> 00:50:01.820
they're small computer algorithm that can do better than us.

778
00:50:01.821 --> 00:50:06.410
Unfortunately that's a history now.
But this kind of pattern matching task,

779
00:50:06.411 --> 00:50:09.830
we are incredibly good and,
and he can't say,
don't do this.

780
00:50:09.831 --> 00:50:11.670
I mean it's probably useful and essay.

781
00:50:12.200 --> 00:50:14.270
I'm trying to make the argument that in fact,

782
00:50:14.271 --> 00:50:17.540
even first impressions might be useful trying to figure out,
well,

783
00:50:17.541 --> 00:50:20.270
are you kind of now,
you know,
sort of a relaxed mode.

784
00:50:20.271 --> 00:50:22.730
Should they approach you or you kind of disgruntled?

785
00:50:22.730 --> 00:50:26.900
Maybe I should get out of the way and that's okay.
I'm just saying it,

786
00:50:27.230 --> 00:50:30.800
go from there and make a big inferential leap and say,
well,

787
00:50:30.801 --> 00:50:34.520
this guy is just just because they are having a bad day to day.

788
00:50:34.521 --> 00:50:39.200
That's how they are in general in life.
And there's lots of,
in social psychology,

789
00:50:39.201 --> 00:50:41.780
there's something called the fundamental attribution error.

790
00:50:42.780 --> 00:50:46.640
Just discover a teen or a few decades ago in the fundamental attribution error

791
00:50:46.641 --> 00:50:48.830
is that whatever I observing your behavior,

792
00:50:49.190 --> 00:50:51.230
I tend to attribute to 10 your character.

793
00:50:51.890 --> 00:50:55.670
But of course you might just hear the bad day at work in my head.
Uh,
you know,

794
00:50:55.671 --> 00:51:00.170
argument with your roommate or a partner or whatever.
None of this.
I see.

795
00:51:00.350 --> 00:51:04.100
I see your behavior here now and it's kind of a,

796
00:51:04.101 --> 00:51:08.390
especially in western cultures,
the natural inclination is to say,
well,
hold on.

797
00:51:08.391 --> 00:51:12.620
I've seen you in home in this single slice of behavior that this behavior is

798
00:51:12.630 --> 00:51:14.660
representative a few as a person.

799
00:51:15.050 --> 00:51:18.710
And most of the time it's not because they're multiple causes of behavior.

800
00:51:19.180 --> 00:51:24.180
<v 8>Do we apply these same types of judgment to other types of primates and then</v>

801
00:51:24.761 --> 00:51:27.430
also to other animals,
um,
that we run across.

802
00:51:27.431 --> 00:51:31.690
So is it possible for me to make the ultimate judgment about what a good dog is?

803
00:51:31.780 --> 00:51:32.600
One,
first of all right.

804
00:51:32.600 --> 00:51:36.230
<v 0>Interesting.
I mean it's actually new to ascension this and a lot of the work on,</v>

805
00:51:36.260 --> 00:51:39.450
I showed you how in the model some dominance,
like the opposite,

806
00:51:39.470 --> 00:51:43.760
just kind of baby faced appearance and has this great a toll just Congo

807
00:51:43.761 --> 00:51:48.200
chlorines and you might have seen him and he's famous for his docs because the

808
00:51:48.201 --> 00:51:51.350
documents kept this instinct.
The first thing they see moving,

809
00:51:51.351 --> 00:51:53.580
they're kind of follow it because they assume it's their mother.

810
00:51:53.581 --> 00:51:55.820
So they will follow him everywhere.

811
00:51:56.120 --> 00:51:59.990
But Lauren's had this interesting paper showing that um,

812
00:52:00.650 --> 00:52:05.120
a lot of mammals,
they're babies have particular coronial futures,

813
00:52:05.121 --> 00:52:06.410
puppies,
kittens,

814
00:52:06.420 --> 00:52:10.310
humans bulging foreheads in all small chins.

815
00:52:10.790 --> 00:52:13.940
And he argued,
and it's not clear that it's actually true,

816
00:52:13.941 --> 00:52:17.600
but he argued that most of the time this automatically triggers this nurture on

817
00:52:17.601 --> 00:52:22.280
Chris Ponds in,
in,
in adults.
And in fact,

818
00:52:22.281 --> 00:52:27.080
a lot of the work in social psychology in this kinds of impressions started from

819
00:52:27.081 --> 00:52:31.750
there.
And uh,
in fact,
um,
uh,
Jay,

820
00:52:31.860 --> 00:52:33.590
Stephen Jay Gould had an interesting,

821
00:52:33.950 --> 00:52:38.390
they sent the evolution cultural evolution of Mickey Mouse,
Mickey Mouse.

822
00:52:38.391 --> 00:52:42.920
If you look over the years she pesky become more and more popular character.

823
00:52:42.921 --> 00:52:47.030
He started to become much more baby faced features and he kind of tracks and

824
00:52:47.031 --> 00:52:51.050
there has been research Lakey in fact people have this stereotypes and say well

825
00:52:51.051 --> 00:52:54.890
this is this doc or is more baby face.
So it's more submissive.

826
00:52:55.430 --> 00:52:59.060
And you had this soul side thinking of on David four lines,
but I'm not sure.

827
00:52:59.061 --> 00:53:03.880
So the stereotypes are there whether they're in fact map into reality this side

828
00:53:03.900 --> 00:53:06.230
or no,
there was nothing in the paper,

829
00:53:06.231 --> 00:53:11.231
but certainly there's is stereotypes that you apply to other nonhuman animals.

830
00:53:12.790 --> 00:53:13.320
Okay.

831
00:53:13.320 --> 00:53:15.210
<v 6>You mentioned that,
uh,</v>

832
00:53:15.211 --> 00:53:19.770
in some of the studies there was a prefacing statement like,
you know,

833
00:53:19.800 --> 00:53:23.250
think about making a good judgment before you answer.

834
00:53:23.580 --> 00:53:28.050
Are there other sort of de statements that we can use in our daily lives,

835
00:53:28.800 --> 00:53:33.800
especially in situations where maybe we're evaluating somebody for it or things

836
00:53:33.811 --> 00:53:34.630
like that.
This is

837
00:53:34.630 --> 00:53:39.490
<v 0>a good point.
I mean actually,
uh,
yeah,</v>

838
00:53:39.491 --> 00:53:39.731
this,

839
00:53:39.731 --> 00:53:43.240
we did it in just one study and most of our studies we just say there are no

840
00:53:43.241 --> 00:53:46.510
right or wrong cancer.
We want you to just use your gut response.

841
00:53:46.930 --> 00:53:51.490
But I mean I think that the best way,
if it's an important decision,

842
00:53:51.970 --> 00:53:56.620
it's important to structure the interaction in such a way that whether it's an

843
00:53:56.630 --> 00:54:00.370
interviewer to some structure or anything comes again,
toll of this information.

844
00:54:00.371 --> 00:54:02.830
A great example is,
and I give this in the book,

845
00:54:03.250 --> 00:54:08.030
is a large symphony orchestra until day to see if you look at the symphony,

846
00:54:08.031 --> 00:54:10.390
York's it's mainly guys,
men,

847
00:54:10.480 --> 00:54:14.230
very few women and suddenly have much more women.

848
00:54:14.231 --> 00:54:18.040
What happens suddenly people became less gender prejudice and they said,

849
00:54:18.041 --> 00:54:22.210
let's give it a goal.
No blind traditions.

850
00:54:22.330 --> 00:54:24.750
That's what happened.
They introduce blind tradition.

851
00:54:24.770 --> 00:54:29.260
So if you're the committee and I'm the candidate or whoever in your than the

852
00:54:29.261 --> 00:54:33.310
other candidate,
they don't see us all day.
Here's how we play.

853
00:54:33.370 --> 00:54:37.750
And suddenly you have a good diagnostic input and you have much more women

854
00:54:38.200 --> 00:54:41.020
represented in symphony orchestra.
But this is like,

855
00:54:41.021 --> 00:54:43.270
it's just the thing could,

856
00:54:43.271 --> 00:54:46.080
psychological bias gets sloughed that most people are bigots.

857
00:54:46.090 --> 00:54:50.680
Most people want to do the right thing.
Most people,
not everybody.

858
00:54:52.210 --> 00:54:55.930
But what happens is that the mice are very subtle and often what you're

859
00:54:55.931 --> 00:54:59.650
observing,
the world disparity,
ambiguous.
It's not clear cut.

860
00:54:59.651 --> 00:55:04.330
I mean everybody who comes to a great symphony orchestra to audition,

861
00:55:04.331 --> 00:55:06.520
they all great musicians to begin with.

862
00:55:06.880 --> 00:55:09.640
So it's very hard to say all this guy's really good.

863
00:55:09.641 --> 00:55:14.320
And I mean it's all a take a pool of candidates to put his to say,
oh this,

864
00:55:14.500 --> 00:55:18.870
this is the pallof reject easier,
right?
But then you suddenly have a third way.

865
00:55:18.970 --> 00:55:20.740
Everybody's pretty good.

866
00:55:21.100 --> 00:55:25.270
And then this is where biases come in.
You know,
if you just,

867
00:55:25.430 --> 00:55:27.670
they can shape who not you one way or another,

868
00:55:27.671 --> 00:55:29.590
and then you ended up with a particular decision.

869
00:55:30.220 --> 00:55:34.960
And if people don't think they're doing something wrong as far as the thinking

870
00:55:34.961 --> 00:55:36.880
they're doing the right thing,
they're doing their best.

871
00:55:36.881 --> 00:55:41.881
But often we are not aware of these biases and particularly in first impressions

872
00:55:42.461 --> 00:55:45.550
because you can talk about trace,
you can talk about gender,

873
00:55:45.551 --> 00:55:47.410
you can talk about sexual orientation.

874
00:55:47.411 --> 00:55:52.150
These are things that we've been talking for many decades.
Doesn't mean that uh,

875
00:55:52.210 --> 00:55:54.550
we've gotten much better in handling kid.

876
00:55:54.551 --> 00:55:58.390
But at least there's some kind of explicit awareness for things that you don't

877
00:55:58.391 --> 00:56:01.900
even talk.
It's just happens.
And if you don't,
um,

878
00:56:02.680 --> 00:56:05.230
take big cautionary measures is going to influence you.

879
00:56:06.250 --> 00:56:11.250
So I mean it's just very much depends when length of your graduate students,

880
00:56:12.540 --> 00:56:17.500
I hate interviews cause unstructured interviews kept zero utility weld and then

881
00:56:17.510 --> 00:56:22.510
they do the correlations between future success is point then that is basically

882
00:56:23.290 --> 00:56:26.530
percent of the variance.
Why do we interview people?

883
00:56:26.531 --> 00:56:31.130
I mean it's like it should know where they want this person based.

884
00:56:31.160 --> 00:56:31.991
In this particular case,

885
00:56:31.991 --> 00:56:36.280
you have lots of evidence for past performance and that should be enough to make

886
00:56:36.281 --> 00:56:40.870
up your decision.
Now issue,
we just put too much faith.
We all,

887
00:56:40.871 --> 00:56:44.500
the way these impressions,
we overweight in interviews or not even,

888
00:56:44.950 --> 00:56:48.550
it's not just the sink an image.
You interact with a person for 30 minutes,

889
00:56:48.850 --> 00:56:52.990
30 minutes is still a very little time.
And you know,
like if you're shy,

890
00:56:52.991 --> 00:56:56.290
maybe wouldn't do so well because the anxiety provoking situation.

891
00:56:56.890 --> 00:57:00.250
So it's just,
but it's very hard to get rid of this.

892
00:57:00.251 --> 00:57:04.480
We as people think they know it,
they saw it.
I mean the kind of,
it feels fright.

893
00:57:04.960 --> 00:57:09.190
But if you look closely at the evidence,
well,
interviews are not very good.

894
00:57:09.640 --> 00:57:14.080
I mean,
take letters of reference.
They're much better,
not perfect.
Why?

895
00:57:14.081 --> 00:57:17.590
Because they summarize samples of observations over a longer time.

896
00:57:17.770 --> 00:57:22.330
It's not my impression.
A few within 30 minutes of informal discussion.
Right?

897
00:57:22.870 --> 00:57:25.570
So it's,
if it's an important decision,

898
00:57:25.571 --> 00:57:28.180
you should just try to look for good,

899
00:57:28.390 --> 00:57:32.650
reliable evidence that is indicative of whatever you're trying to achieve in the

900
00:57:32.651 --> 00:57:33.940
particular situation.

901
00:57:35.680 --> 00:57:39.010
