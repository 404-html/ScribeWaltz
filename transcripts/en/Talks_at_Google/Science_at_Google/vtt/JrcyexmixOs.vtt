1
00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:11.480
Hello,
thank you all for coming.

2
00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:17.010
This is going to be a talk by my friend,
the journalist and science writer.
Uh,

3
00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.893
Neil,

4
00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:23.170
please silence your phones and on Google we can have some copies of the book for

5
00:00:25.311 --> 00:00:29.210
you to take home if you're interested by what he has to say.

6
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.330
Neil and I worked together as software engineers more than 20 years ago in

7
00:00:35.331 --> 00:00:39.470
Berkeley.
And,
uh,
we've been in touch but not nearly enough.

8
00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:45.220
And he has had such a exciting career that went to the edge of physics,

9
00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:51.800
one of his other books.
And uh,
yes,
please,

10
00:00:51.801 --> 00:00:56.480
uh,
welcome,
uh,
Neil for his,
uh,
presenting his latest book.
It's just out.

11
00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.320
<v 1>[inaudible].</v>

12
00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:07.890
<v 2>Yeah.
So thank you.
I know.
Oh,
for that introduction.
I know,</v>

13
00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:09.630
and I go back a long way.
Um,

14
00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.640
I was a software engineer before I became a journalist and uh,
I,

15
00:01:13.641 --> 00:01:16.370
it's really a pleasure to be speaking here at Google.

16
00:01:16.371 --> 00:01:20.930
The last couple of times I came to speak where if I,
my previous two books,

17
00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:21.740
uh,

18
00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:26.740
which I really enjoyed the talks and the first one was called the edge of

19
00:01:26.841 --> 00:01:30.170
physics and the second one was called the man who wasn't there.

20
00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:35.740
And both of those books I was able to sort of tell stories about people and

21
00:01:36.231 --> 00:01:39.590
places that I visited.
This book is somewhat different.

22
00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:42.950
The protagonist of this book,
he's a single experiment.

23
00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:48.200
It's an experiment with a 200 year old history.
Um,
and uh,

24
00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:52.880
this book is really the story of quantum mechanics told through the lens of one

25
00:01:52.881 --> 00:01:56.270
experiment and it's modern variations.
Um,

26
00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:58.640
so it's a,

27
00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:03.030
it's a slightly different kind of work in the sense that it's hard to tell a

28
00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:06.320
stories in the way that I could have done with the previous two books.

29
00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:11.590
So what I thought I'd do is I'll start by just reading a few pages,

30
00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:16.220
uh,
uh,
just four or five pages from the book,
the opening four or five pages,

31
00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:21.580
just to give you an idea of how a writer might want to think about opening a

32
00:02:21.621 --> 00:02:22.310
book,

33
00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.690
which is actually quite nerdy at some fundamental level because it really just

34
00:02:26.691 --> 00:02:31.520
gets into the details of this one experiment,
but you still want to,
uh,

35
00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:35.150
write it in a way that's appealing to almost anybody who wants to pick it up.

36
00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:41.300
And then I have a,
a set of slides that I would like to,
uh,

37
00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.960
go through just to,
just to tell you what this experiment is.

38
00:02:44.961 --> 00:02:47.690
Most of you would be very familiar with this experiment.

39
00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.010
It's called the double slit experiment.
Um,

40
00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:53.420
but it's amazing how,
um,

41
00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:56.420
how much this particular experiment pervades quantum mechanics.

42
00:02:56.421 --> 00:03:00.620
So I want to run you through a few slides just to talk a little bit about,
uh,

43
00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:04.710
what it tells us about the big conceptual issues in quantum mechanics.
Uh,

44
00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.250
and then we can have a short Q and a.
So,
uh,

45
00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:13.720
so if you don't mind,
I'm going to start reading from the book.

46
00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.700
So this is the prologue,
the story of nature taunting us.

47
00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:27.580
The office is simply the most uncluttered of any physicist office I've ever
seen.

48
00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:32.530
There's a chair alongside a small table with nothing on it,
no books,
no papers,

49
00:03:32.531 --> 00:03:36.580
no lamp,
no computer,
nothing.
A Sofa graces the office,

50
00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:42.070
large windows overlook a small lake and the trees around which are bare except

51
00:03:42.071 --> 00:03:45.820
for a few stragglers that were holding onto their fall foliage defying the

52
00:03:45.821 --> 00:03:47.860
approaching winter in this part of Ontario,

53
00:03:47.861 --> 00:03:52.861
Canada using hardy puts his laptop on the table pointing out that he does most

54
00:03:53.441 --> 00:03:57.260
of his work in cafes and figures that all he needs in his office is a cafe like

55
00:03:57.261 --> 00:03:59.290
small table to sit down his laptop.

56
00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:03.880
There is the obligatorily blackboard taking up most of one wall of his office.

57
00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:07.660
It doesn't take long for hardy to spring up and start chalking it up with

58
00:04:07.661 --> 00:04:09.100
diagrams and equations.

59
00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:13.390
Something that most of the quantum physicists I meet seem inclined to do.

60
00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.860
We start talking about some esoteric aspect of quantum physics.
When he says,

61
00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:23.260
when he stops and says,
I started off the wrong way to reset our discussion.

62
00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:28.240
He says,
imagine you're a factory and they make bombs.
He has my attention.

63
00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:32.440
He writes two names on the blackboard elixir and Weidman.

64
00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:37.860
He's talking about something called the elixir vitamin bomb puzzle named after

65
00:04:37.961 --> 00:04:38.970
two Israeli physicists.

66
00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:43.120
The puzzle exemplifies the counter intuitive nature of the quantum world in ways

67
00:04:43.121 --> 00:04:48.010
that non physicists can appreciate it confounds physicists to in no small

68
00:04:48.011 --> 00:04:50.860
measure,
the problem goes something like this.

69
00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:54.130
There's a factory that makes bombs equipped the triggers.

70
00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:58.720
The triggers are so sensitive that a single particle,
any particle,

71
00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:01.570
even a particle of light,
can set them off.

72
00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:06.220
There's a big dilemma how the factory's Assembly nine is faulty.

73
00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:11.260
It's churning out both good bombs with triggers and bad bombs without triggers.

74
00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:15.580
Hardy rights hardly writes them as quote,
good and bad,

75
00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.830
and quips about the quotation marks.

76
00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:20.650
Obviously you may have a different moral perspective on it.

77
00:05:20.651 --> 00:05:24.070
He says the task is to identify the good bones.

78
00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:27.670
This means having to check whether the bombs have triggers,

79
00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:32.110
but examining each bomb isn't the correct strategy because in order to do so,

80
00:05:32.111 --> 00:05:36.460
you would need to shine light on it however faint and that would cause a good

81
00:05:36.461 --> 00:05:40.390
bomb to explode.
The only ones unexploded would be the duds without triggers.

82
00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:45.220
So how does one solve the problem?
If it helps,
we are allowed one concession.

83
00:05:45.221 --> 00:05:49.180
We can detonate some bombs as long as we are left with some good on detonated

84
00:05:49.181 --> 00:05:52.930
bombs from our everyday experience of how the world works.

85
00:05:52.931 --> 00:05:56.920
This is an impossible problem to solve,
but the quantum world,

86
00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:01.490
the world of very small things like molecules and atoms and electrons and

87
00:06:01.491 --> 00:06:04.580
protons and photons behaves in bizarre ways.

88
00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:08.330
The physics that governs the behavior of this microscopic world is called

89
00:06:08.331 --> 00:06:10.070
quantum physics or quantum mechanics.

90
00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:13.850
And we can use quantum physics to find good bombs without setting them off.

91
00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:15.500
He went with a simple setup.

92
00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:20.090
It's possible to salvage about half the good bombs hit involves using a modern

93
00:06:20.091 --> 00:06:24.560
variation of a 200 year old experiment called the double slit experiment.

94
00:06:24.561 --> 00:06:28.700
It was first done in the early 18 hundreds to challenge Isaac Newton's ideas

95
00:06:28.701 --> 00:06:29.870
about the nature of light.

96
00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:33.660
The experiment took center stage again in the early 20th century.

97
00:06:33.661 --> 00:06:35.660
You went two of the founders of quantum physics,

98
00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:39.350
Albert Einstein and Niels Bohr grappled with this revelations about the nature

99
00:06:39.351 --> 00:06:44.300
of reality.
In the 1960s Richard Fineman extol his virtues,

100
00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:47.480
saying that the double slit experiment contain all of the mysteries of the

101
00:06:47.481 --> 00:06:48.314
quantum world.

102
00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:52.850
A simpler and more elegant experience will be a simpler and more elegant

103
00:06:52.851 --> 00:06:54.830
experiment would be hard to find.

104
00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:59.900
The workings of which a high school student can grasp yet profound enough in its

105
00:06:59.901 --> 00:07:03.710
implications to rebuild their brains like Einstein's and boards or confusion

106
00:07:03.711 --> 00:07:04.940
that continues to this day.

107
00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:09.050
This is the story of quantum mechanics from the perspective of one classic

108
00:07:09.051 --> 00:07:14.000
experiment and it's subtle sophisticated variations including one that has,

109
00:07:14.001 --> 00:07:16.880
we'll see Saul fell.
It's revisement bomb puzzle.

110
00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:20.560
Whether these variations are carried out as thought experiments by luminous

111
00:07:20.561 --> 00:07:24.290
minds or painstakingly performed in the basement lab.
So physics departments,

112
00:07:24.730 --> 00:07:27.920
it's the story of nature taunting us.
Catch me if you can.

113
00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:34.090
So I will read a couple of more pages from the opening chapter.

114
00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:38.840
And this chapter actually begins by talking about a lecture that Richard Fineman

115
00:07:38.841 --> 00:07:41.690
gave,
which is one of the most extraordinary lectures you can see.

116
00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:43.550
It was given in 1964

117
00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:51.110
and it became a very nice way to actually open the chapter just to talk about

118
00:07:51.111 --> 00:07:55.550
what he was saying.
So chapter one,
the case of the experiment with two holes,

119
00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:57.740
Richard Fineman explains to the central mystery.

120
00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:03.260
Richard Fineman was still a year away from winning his Nobel prize and two

121
00:08:03.261 --> 00:08:06.590
decades away from publishing and endearing autobiographical book that introduced

122
00:08:06.591 --> 00:08:10.820
him to novices as a straight talking scientists interested in everything from

123
00:08:10.850 --> 00:08:15.080
cracking saves to playing drums.
But in November,

124
00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:17.780
1964 two students at Cornell University in Ithaca,
New York,

125
00:08:17.781 --> 00:08:20.120
he was already a star and they received him.
As such,

126
00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:24.680
Fineman came to deliver a series of lectures.
Strains are far about Cayuga's.

127
00:08:24.681 --> 00:08:26.690
Waters rang out from the Cornell chimes,

128
00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:32.060
the provost introduce Fineman as an instructor and physicist par excellence,

129
00:08:32.570 --> 00:08:35.120
but also of course has an accomplished Bongo drummer.

130
00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:39.320
Fineman strode onto the stage to the kind of applause reserved for performing

131
00:08:39.321 --> 00:08:44.090
artists and opened his lecture.
With this observation.
It's odd,

132
00:08:44.091 --> 00:08:47.660
but in the infrequent occasions when I have been called upon in a formal place

133
00:08:47.661 --> 00:08:50.990
to play the Bongo drums,
the introducer never finds,

134
00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:54.740
never seems to find it necessary to mention that I also do theoretical,

135
00:08:56.460 --> 00:08:59.520
but his sixth lecture,
Fineman dispense with any preamble,

136
00:08:59.521 --> 00:09:03.180
even a talk on hello to the clapping students and jump straight into our

137
00:09:03.181 --> 00:09:07.290
intuition and jumped straight into how our intuition,

138
00:09:07.291 --> 00:09:10.650
which is suited to dealing with everyday things that we can see and hear in

139
00:09:10.651 --> 00:09:15.651
touch fails when it comes to understanding nature at very small scales and often

140
00:09:16.141 --> 00:09:19.110
he said it's experiments that challenge our intuitive view of the world.

141
00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:21.130
Then we see unexpected things.

142
00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:25.470
So at Fineman we see things that are very far from what most.

143
00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:29.610
We see things that are very far from what we could have imagined and so our

144
00:09:29.611 --> 00:09:31.290
imagination is stretched to the utmost,

145
00:09:31.291 --> 00:09:34.680
you said not as in fiction to imagine things which aren't really there,

146
00:09:35.130 --> 00:09:38.520
but our imagination stretched to the utmost just to comprehend those things

147
00:09:38.521 --> 00:09:42.510
which are there and it's this kind of situation that I want to talk about.

148
00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:45.330
He said the lecture was about quantum mechanics,

149
00:09:45.331 --> 00:09:47.640
the physics of a very small things in particular,

150
00:09:47.641 --> 00:09:51.720
it was about the nature of light and Subatomic bits of matter such as electrons.

151
00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:53.011
In other words,

152
00:09:53.011 --> 00:09:56.760
it was about the nature of reality to light and electrons show wave like

153
00:09:56.761 --> 00:10:01.080
behavior like water does or do they act like particles like grains of sand do

154
00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:05.160
turns out that saying yes or no it would be both correct and incorrect.

155
00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:09.840
Any attempt to visualize the behavior of the microscopic Subatomic entities make

156
00:10:09.841 --> 00:10:14.670
some mockery offering tuition.
They behave in their own inimitable way,

157
00:10:15.270 --> 00:10:18.810
said Feinman which technically could be called the quantum mechanical way.

158
00:10:19.380 --> 00:10:22.380
They behave in a way that is nothing like you've ever seen before.

159
00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:25.590
Your experience with things that you have seen before is inadequate,

160
00:10:25.591 --> 00:10:30.090
is incomplete.
The behavior of things on a very tiny scale is simply different.

161
00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:33.030
He said they do not behave just like particles.

162
00:10:33.031 --> 00:10:34.710
They do not behave just like waves,

163
00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:38.310
but at least light and electrons behave in exactly the same way.

164
00:10:38.311 --> 00:10:40.290
So I'd find men that is their both screwy.

165
00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:44.400
Fineman caution the audience that the lecture was going to be difficult because

166
00:10:44.401 --> 00:10:47.880
it will challenge their wildly had views about how nature works.

167
00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:50.580
But the difficulty really is psychological.

168
00:10:50.610 --> 00:10:52.880
He said an exist in the perpetual torment.

169
00:10:52.890 --> 00:10:56.280
The results from you're saying to yourself,
but how can it be like that,

170
00:10:56.670 --> 00:10:58.890
which really is a reflection of an uncontrolled,

171
00:10:58.891 --> 00:11:01.050
but I say utterly vein desire to see it.

172
00:11:01.050 --> 00:11:03.330
In terms of some analogy with something familiar,

173
00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:07.740
I will not describe it in terms of analogy,
analogy with something familiar.

174
00:11:07.741 --> 00:11:09.180
He said,
I'll simply describe it.

175
00:11:09.450 --> 00:11:13.230
And so to make his point over the course of an hour of spellbinding oratory,

176
00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:18.150
Fineman focused on the one experiment which has been designed to contain all of

177
00:11:18.151 --> 00:11:22.260
the mystery of quantum mechanics to put you up against the paradoxes and

178
00:11:22.261 --> 00:11:26.550
mysteries and peculiarities of nature.
It was the double slit experiment.

179
00:11:27.810 --> 00:11:31.920
It's difficult to imagine a simpler experiment or as we'll discover over the

180
00:11:31.921 --> 00:11:34.380
course of this book,
one more confounding.

181
00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:39.510
We start with a source of light place in front of the source or sheet of opaque

182
00:11:39.511 --> 00:11:42.810
material with two narrow closely spaced slits or openings.

183
00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:45.420
This creates two parts for the light to go through.

184
00:11:45.930 --> 00:11:48.570
On the other side of this opaque sheet is a screen,

185
00:11:49.020 --> 00:11:50.940
what would you expect to see on the screen?

186
00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:56.620
So that's how the book begins.
And I think for the rest of the top,

187
00:11:56.621 --> 00:12:01.280
I just want to run through the experiment and point out some of the big uh,

188
00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:05.350
conceptual issues in quantum mechanics that this one simple experiment
addresses.

189
00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:10.300
So this is the experiment that was first done 200 years ago.

190
00:12:12.010 --> 00:12:16.930
There's a source of light is shining at an opaque sheet with two slits cut into

191
00:12:16.931 --> 00:12:20.740
it and you're asked the question,
what would you expect to see on the other side?

192
00:12:21.580 --> 00:12:23.560
Your infusion pretty much says,
oh,

193
00:12:23.561 --> 00:12:25.690
I shouldn't just see two strips of light on the other side.

194
00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:29.650
Actually the answer really depends on what you think is the nature of light.

195
00:12:30.490 --> 00:12:35.490
And in the 17th century,
uh,
thanks to eyesight,
Newton,

196
00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:37.810
our ideas about the nature of light,

197
00:12:38.350 --> 00:12:41.590
we're really due to his corpuscular theory of light.

198
00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:45.490
Newton said the light is made of corporate salts or particles.
So if,

199
00:12:45.670 --> 00:12:49.890
if light is made of particles and if you're streaming,
uh,
you know,

200
00:12:49.891 --> 00:12:51.640
a beam of particles,
at least two slits,

201
00:12:52.030 --> 00:12:55.540
then that you expect a certain result to come out of this experiment.

202
00:12:56.110 --> 00:12:59.860
So an intro,
thinking about light,
let's just for a moment,

203
00:13:00.070 --> 00:13:03.130
just think about say particles that we understand.

204
00:13:03.131 --> 00:13:04.540
Particles of sand for instance.

205
00:13:04.541 --> 00:13:09.130
So this might be a sandblaster just blasting sand at these two slits.

206
00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:13.730
So if,
uh,
say the right's leader's closed,
right?
What do you expect?

207
00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:18.390
You expect to see the sign go through?
The left slid and hit the screen,
Eh,

208
00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:21.520
you know,
it's right behind the open slit.
The same thing.

209
00:13:21.521 --> 00:13:22.810
If the left third disclosed,

210
00:13:23.020 --> 00:13:28.020
you expect to see the sign goes through the other slate not.
And you know,
uh,

211
00:13:28.570 --> 00:13:30.890
the closed left slurred is obstructing the sign.

212
00:13:30.891 --> 00:13:35.020
So basically you're seeing the particles hit the screen right behind the open

213
00:13:35.021 --> 00:13:38.260
slit.
And if you were to now open boats,
slit,

214
00:13:38.350 --> 00:13:41.650
our intuition tells us that this is what should happen,
right?
You should,

215
00:13:41.710 --> 00:13:44.650
you should basically c two strips of,
uh,

216
00:13:44.890 --> 00:13:48.580
particles hitting the screen on the back of the opaque screen.

217
00:13:49.870 --> 00:13:54.870
This is not what happened when the experiment was first done in the early 18

218
00:13:54.911 --> 00:13:58.780
hundreds by an English physicist called Thomas Young.
Uh,

219
00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:03.070
he saw something completely different.
He saw this,
he saw

220
00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:09.010
bands of light and dark appearing on the other side of the two slits.

221
00:14:09.550 --> 00:14:13.210
So here,
think of the screen as a photographic plate.

222
00:14:13.211 --> 00:14:15.640
So the dark bands are where most of the light is hitting.

223
00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:18.250
And so it's a negative.

224
00:14:18.730 --> 00:14:23.350
So the dark bands are where the light is hitting and you can see that there are

225
00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:26.140
alternating dark and light bands.
So there's light,
there's no light,

226
00:14:26.141 --> 00:14:27.360
there's light,
no light,
right?

227
00:14:27.670 --> 00:14:31.450
This can only be explained if you think of light behaving like a wave.

228
00:14:31.930 --> 00:14:35.980
So the wave hits the two slits and then from each slit to new sets of waves

229
00:14:36.010 --> 00:14:40.480
start coming out.
This spread,
eventually they will interfere with each other.

230
00:14:40.870 --> 00:14:44.680
And the places where these two sets of ways interfere constructively,

231
00:14:44.860 --> 00:14:48.880
meaning the crests of a one way line up with the crest of the other.

232
00:14:48.881 --> 00:14:53.240
You get constructive interference.
And when the,
and the trough a lineup,

233
00:14:53.330 --> 00:14:54.860
you get destructive interference.

234
00:14:54.861 --> 00:14:57.440
So essentially you get this interference pattern.

235
00:14:57.500 --> 00:15:01.900
This is absolutely characteristic of waves.
You can see this,
uh,
you know,

236
00:15:01.910 --> 00:15:04.940
anywhere you see waves,
for instance,
uh,
you know,

237
00:15:04.970 --> 00:15:07.220
walk with water waves on a lake or in the ocean.

238
00:15:07.970 --> 00:15:12.970
Now this idea that light behaves like a wave kind of held through pretty much

239
00:15:14.811 --> 00:15:17.330
through the 19 hundreds,
uh,
sorry,
the 18 hundreds.

240
00:15:17.331 --> 00:15:19.070
And then along came quantum mechanics.

241
00:15:19.580 --> 00:15:23.480
Early 1900 Einstein was the first to point out that light.

242
00:15:23.750 --> 00:15:27.320
There are certain situations in certain phenomena in nature,

243
00:15:27.321 --> 00:15:28.910
particularly the photoelectric effect,

244
00:15:28.911 --> 00:15:30.740
which is what he was talking about at the time,

245
00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:35.960
can only be explained if you think of light as being made of particles.

246
00:15:36.530 --> 00:15:37.520
So,
uh,

247
00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:41.180
quantum mechanics is that all energy is quantize light as a form of energy.

248
00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:45.920
And so light is made of individual in the indivisible Quanta,

249
00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:49.700
uh,
of,
you know,
and these contact can be called particles of light.

250
00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:55.000
Now this same experiment becomes incredibly,
uh,

251
00:15:55.190 --> 00:15:56.900
confounding.
So if you go back to this,

252
00:15:57.680 --> 00:16:01.970
now imagine that your source here is beaming,
say,

253
00:16:01.971 --> 00:16:04.850
red laser light.
So light of one frequency.

254
00:16:05.510 --> 00:16:09.710
And we now know from quantum mechanics that light,

255
00:16:10.230 --> 00:16:14.760
uh,
is made of particles.
So,
so this is beaming out,
uh,

256
00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:16.220
individual particles.

257
00:16:16.250 --> 00:16:19.910
Now imagine also that you can turn down the intensity of this laser light to the

258
00:16:19.911 --> 00:16:23.720
point that only one particle of light is coming out at a time.

259
00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:28.010
Just one at a time,
maybe one every five seconds,
one every 10 seconds.

260
00:16:28.011 --> 00:16:28.820
It doesn't matter.

261
00:16:28.820 --> 00:16:32.540
But just one particle is going through that piraters at any given time.

262
00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:34.940
And now what do you expect?

263
00:16:34.941 --> 00:16:38.930
Now your intuition pretty much says that it should behave like particles of sand

264
00:16:38.931 --> 00:16:39.740
because you know,

265
00:16:39.740 --> 00:16:42.770
classically you're thinking it should go through one slit or the other and it

266
00:16:42.771 --> 00:16:47.771
should end up on the photographic plate right behind the open slits and any

267
00:16:48.861 --> 00:16:51.850
guess as to what happens.
This is quantum mechanics.

268
00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:54.310
Obviously that's not going to happen.
Uh,

269
00:16:55.400 --> 00:16:59.540
you get exactly the same result except that this is what starts building up.

270
00:16:59.570 --> 00:17:04.570
If there is a photographic plate on the other side of the slits and if you're

271
00:17:04.911 --> 00:17:05.661
sending one,

272
00:17:05.661 --> 00:17:09.560
particularly at a time in the beginning it seems like the particles are randomly

273
00:17:09.561 --> 00:17:13.850
going to,
you know,
uh,
look at certain locations on the,
on the plate.

274
00:17:14.180 --> 00:17:16.430
But over time as the pattern develops,

275
00:17:16.431 --> 00:17:19.250
you see that the same interference pattern develops.
Right?

276
00:17:19.460 --> 00:17:24.460
This is again indicative of some interference that's going on except,

277
00:17:24.950 --> 00:17:27.610
and this is something really important to appreciate.

278
00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:32.510
You're creating a particle and you're detecting a single particle

279
00:17:34.070 --> 00:17:36.210
and nothing,
you know,

280
00:17:36.450 --> 00:17:39.710
even a single particle is going through the double set apart as he does not

281
00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:41.360
interacting with any other particle.

282
00:17:41.361 --> 00:17:43.970
There's just one particle in their pirate as at any given time.

283
00:17:44.420 --> 00:17:47.570
So yet an interference pattern is emerging.

284
00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:50.100
So what is interfering with what?
Right?

285
00:17:50.430 --> 00:17:54.720
So this becomes a really important question to ask and,

286
00:17:54.900 --> 00:17:57.660
and ends up being the central question in trying to understand some of the

287
00:17:57.661 --> 00:18:01.130
conceptual issues with quantum mechanics.
So if,

288
00:18:01.170 --> 00:18:05.790
if you are now shooting,
uh,
you know,
individual photons of say,
red light,

289
00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:09.600
uh,
of a given frequency at this particular double slit,

290
00:18:09.930 --> 00:18:11.670
then you get this interference pattern of the back,

291
00:18:11.671 --> 00:18:15.300
which is exactly the same that you saw when there was lots of light going

292
00:18:15.301 --> 00:18:19.380
through,
uh,
going through the double slit.
So the question is,

293
00:18:19.381 --> 00:18:24.060
what is it that is interfering?
So mathematically there is an explanation.

294
00:18:24.330 --> 00:18:26.380
So mathematically,
uh,

295
00:18:26.580 --> 00:18:30.900
each photon or each particle of light is represented by what is,

296
00:18:30.980 --> 00:18:34.080
is called away function.
It's a mathematical abstraction.

297
00:18:34.830 --> 00:18:38.970
This way function is,
is,
is a function.

298
00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:42.720
It's a function which tells you what it's value is at some point in space and

299
00:18:42.721 --> 00:18:44.590
time and this function

300
00:18:46.230 --> 00:18:49.020
evolves according to something called the Schrodinger equation.

301
00:18:49.050 --> 00:18:52.620
So there is an equation that tells you how this way function changes with time

302
00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:54.300
and mathematically.

303
00:18:54.301 --> 00:18:59.130
The way you model this system is you let this way function propagate,

304
00:18:59.131 --> 00:19:01.770
propagate towards the two slits.
It hits the two slots,

305
00:19:01.771 --> 00:19:06.030
it acts exactly like a wave.
It goes through both slits on the other side.

306
00:19:06.031 --> 00:19:10.800
You have two sets of waves coming out and they interfere and you get an

307
00:19:10.801 --> 00:19:12.090
interference pattern,
but you're,

308
00:19:12.150 --> 00:19:16.170
you're getting it in turf interference pattern of a mathematical abstraction,

309
00:19:16.530 --> 00:19:18.630
right?
What is this way function?

310
00:19:19.350 --> 00:19:23.220
What has his way function got to do with a single particle and that is really

311
00:19:23.221 --> 00:19:27.930
the central issue that this particular experiment starts addressing.

312
00:19:28.110 --> 00:19:31.830
So we can start asking what is it that's interfering?
There is,

313
00:19:31.890 --> 00:19:36.750
there is a wave function that's going through the two slits and interfering and

314
00:19:36.751 --> 00:19:38.940
creating a interference pattern on the other side.

315
00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:41.100
But the wave function is a mathematical abstraction.

316
00:19:41.130 --> 00:19:46.130
It for any system of more than two particles this way function doesn't even

317
00:19:46.411 --> 00:19:48.750
exist in normal three dimensional space.

318
00:19:48.751 --> 00:19:52.440
It exists in a mathematical space called configuration space.

319
00:19:52.441 --> 00:19:56.640
It can have a large number of dimensions depending upon what your number of

320
00:19:56.641 --> 00:19:57.474
particles are.

321
00:19:57.600 --> 00:20:02.550
So what is actually going through the two slits and it's very,

322
00:20:02.551 --> 00:20:05.730
very unclear as to what what is happening here.

323
00:20:06.090 --> 00:20:09.900
So the wave function goes through the two slits,
a mathematical abstraction.

324
00:20:09.900 --> 00:20:12.870
You can calculate what the interference pattern is on the other side,

325
00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:17.290
and then the interference pattern tells you basically the value of the way

326
00:20:17.291 --> 00:20:19.560
function at various points in space.

327
00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:24.360
And you can then ask what is the value representing?

328
00:20:24.450 --> 00:20:27.780
It turns out it's not really telling you where the Photon is aware of the

329
00:20:27.781 --> 00:20:32.400
particle of light is the value of the wave function at any point in space is

330
00:20:32.401 --> 00:20:35.880
only giving you the probability of being able to find the photon there if you

331
00:20:35.881 --> 00:20:36.714
look for it.

332
00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:40.170
So it turns out that the interference pattern created by the way functions,

333
00:20:41.820 --> 00:20:42.331
there are many,

334
00:20:42.331 --> 00:20:46.020
many regions where there is a nonzero probability for the photon to end up in.

335
00:20:46.770 --> 00:20:50.170
So you have a single photon that is going through the two slits.

336
00:20:51.130 --> 00:20:53.080
It's being represented by a wave function,

337
00:20:53.081 --> 00:20:56.560
which essentially goes through two slits,
interferes on the other side.

338
00:20:56.590 --> 00:21:00.130
And on the other side you have these various regions of constructive

339
00:21:00.131 --> 00:21:00.964
interference,
which are,

340
00:21:01.090 --> 00:21:05.560
which all have nonzero probability for the elect for the photon to end up in for

341
00:21:05.561 --> 00:21:08.500
any given photon.
When you send it through the two slits,

342
00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:13.250
there is no way to tell exactly where it will end up.
So it's non-deterministic,

343
00:21:13.750 --> 00:21:15.610
right?
You've created a single photon.

344
00:21:16.210 --> 00:21:18.910
It's somehow has gone through the two slits on,
on the other side,

345
00:21:18.911 --> 00:21:23.860
it's going to end up in one of many locations which have a nonzero probability.

346
00:21:24.310 --> 00:21:28.930
So this wave function is essentially a way to calculate what is the probability

347
00:21:29.290 --> 00:21:33.830
of finding a photon in some location on the other side.
And it turns out that,
uh,

348
00:21:34.750 --> 00:21:36.670
when you do a measurement,
in this case,

349
00:21:36.671 --> 00:21:39.580
the photon interacting with your photographic plate is the measurement.

350
00:21:39.970 --> 00:21:42.820
That measurement somehow collapses that wave function,

351
00:21:42.821 --> 00:21:45.760
which until the measurement happened,
uh,

352
00:21:46.180 --> 00:21:49.270
give you probabilities of the photon has possibly being in.

353
00:21:49.560 --> 00:21:53.500
You know that off gave you probabilities of finding the photon in many different

354
00:21:53.501 --> 00:21:57.870
places.
But the moment you do a measurement,
when the photon interacts,

355
00:21:57.910 --> 00:22:00.370
when the wave function interacts with the photographic plate,

356
00:22:00.730 --> 00:22:01.930
the way function collapses.

357
00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:05.230
The photon is found in one place and not in any of the other places that it

358
00:22:05.231 --> 00:22:06.064
could have been.

359
00:22:06.220 --> 00:22:11.220
So this act of measurement kind of collapsing the wave function is a huge issue

360
00:22:11.561 --> 00:22:14.740
in,
in quantum mechanics because quantum mechanics basically says that it's the

361
00:22:14.741 --> 00:22:17.860
measurement that is causing the collapse of the wave function,

362
00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:21.010
but it doesn't actually define what a measurement is.

363
00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:26.640
A standard quantum mechanics just divides up the world into quantum systems that

364
00:22:26.771 --> 00:22:30.100
are being measured and imperatives is that are measuring,
doing the measuring.

365
00:22:30.310 --> 00:22:34.150
But there is no distinction mathematically speaking as to what constitutes a

366
00:22:34.151 --> 00:22:37.720
quantum system and what constitutes a measuring classical or priorities.

367
00:22:38.470 --> 00:22:41.560
There's also another mystery that this experiment highlights.

368
00:22:41.561 --> 00:22:45.670
Now if you try to figure out which slit the photon is going through,

369
00:22:45.910 --> 00:22:48.760
like your intuition is telling you,
not commander,
it's a single photon,

370
00:22:48.970 --> 00:22:53.920
it has to go through one slit or the other and say you set up a system where you

371
00:22:53.921 --> 00:22:57.850
can tell which slid the photon is going through without destroying the Futon,

372
00:22:58.380 --> 00:23:00.100
then the interference problem disappears.

373
00:23:00.340 --> 00:23:05.050
So if you try to look to see which slid the photon went through,

374
00:23:05.190 --> 00:23:07.810
the interference pattern disappears.
If you don't look,

375
00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:09.670
there's an interference pattern,
right?

376
00:23:10.270 --> 00:23:14.830
So all of these things start meeting to questions about what is really happening

377
00:23:14.860 --> 00:23:16.990
at that very,
very basic level of reality.

378
00:23:16.991 --> 00:23:20.890
It's very clear intuitively that the photon can't possibly be going through both

379
00:23:20.891 --> 00:23:24.160
slits at once,
right?
I mean you've created a single photon,

380
00:23:24.161 --> 00:23:25.510
you've detected a single photon.

381
00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:29.230
All your classical intuition is telling you it's surely it's not going through

382
00:23:29.231 --> 00:23:30.100
both slits at once,

383
00:23:30.370 --> 00:23:33.220
but something is going through both slits at once because you are getting an

384
00:23:33.221 --> 00:23:35.310
interference pattern.
So,

385
00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:37.810
so the is the way function going through both slits at once.

386
00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:39.340
But then what is the way function?

387
00:23:39.370 --> 00:23:43.300
The wave function is a mathematical abstraction.
We have no idea what that is.

388
00:23:43.690 --> 00:23:48.690
It exists in some abstract configuration space and interferes.

389
00:23:49.460 --> 00:23:54.260
But that's just mathematics.
We don't know if that is real.
So if that's not real,

390
00:23:54.470 --> 00:23:57.410
then again,
the question comes back then what is going through both slits?

391
00:23:57.411 --> 00:23:59.180
So this circular argument keeps going,

392
00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:03.440
this idea of the wave function being real or not real,

393
00:24:03.470 --> 00:24:08.210
whether it is actually representing something that is happening in reality in

394
00:24:08.211 --> 00:24:09.044
the sense that it,

395
00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:14.120
it represents something actual about reality is it's part of the ontology of the

396
00:24:14.121 --> 00:24:16.530
world,
or is it just,
it,

397
00:24:16.550 --> 00:24:19.490
does it just represent our knowledge about what's happening?

398
00:24:19.491 --> 00:24:22.670
So it's the wave function,
authentic or ontological,

399
00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:27.380
or is it epistemic?
These questions are yet undecided in quantum mechanics.

400
00:24:27.380 --> 00:24:32.210
We really don't know the status of the wave function as to what that really is,

401
00:24:32.270 --> 00:24:36.800
right?
So these kinds of that you can see there,
just this one simple experiment.

402
00:24:37.610 --> 00:24:41.530
The moment you tried to understand what's happening,
it completely,
uh,

403
00:24:41.990 --> 00:24:45.560
explored this whole business of what actually is the nature of reality.

404
00:24:46.910 --> 00:24:51.240
I just want to run you through one very,
uh,

405
00:24:51.380 --> 00:24:54.260
simple version,
a modern version of this double slit experiment.

406
00:24:54.261 --> 00:24:56.090
It's called [inaudible] Zender interferometer.

407
00:24:56.630 --> 00:24:59.840
And this will lead us to trying to answer the question about how do you detect

408
00:25:00.350 --> 00:25:01.850
that bomb,
uh,

409
00:25:02.330 --> 00:25:07.280
which had life triggers versus a bomb that had duds,
right?
So this is

410
00:25:08.870 --> 00:25:13.070
the beginning of what's called a maximum under interferometer of photon or light

411
00:25:13.071 --> 00:25:15.290
hits this thing called a beam splitter.

412
00:25:15.380 --> 00:25:17.630
A beam splitter is simply a half silvered mirror.

413
00:25:18.020 --> 00:25:22.280
Any window pane actually works like you can see if you look at the window pane,

414
00:25:22.281 --> 00:25:25.550
some of the light is getting transmitted in,
some of it is getting reflected.

415
00:25:26.090 --> 00:25:29.150
So if you imagine a laboratory grade beam splitter,

416
00:25:29.151 --> 00:25:34.010
it's reflecting exactly half the and transmitting exactly half the late a half.

417
00:25:34.020 --> 00:25:37.820
The energy of the light that's incident on this beam splitter goes one way.

418
00:25:37.850 --> 00:25:39.500
Half of it goes the other way.

419
00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:42.710
And that kind of works when you're thinking about a lot of light.

420
00:25:42.711 --> 00:25:44.190
If you just take a,
you know,
a,

421
00:25:44.230 --> 00:25:47.810
a flashlight and shine it at the beam splitter in PAF is reflected,

422
00:25:47.811 --> 00:25:52.400
half is transmitted.
That makes sense.
But now remember it's quantum mechanics.

423
00:25:52.401 --> 00:25:54.860
So you're allowed to talk about single particles of light.

424
00:25:54.861 --> 00:25:59.030
So now what happens if a single particle of light is incident on this beam

425
00:25:59.031 --> 00:25:59.864
splitter?

426
00:26:00.410 --> 00:26:04.940
Now we know from quantum mechanics that the single particle of light cannot be

427
00:26:04.941 --> 00:26:07.370
divided any further.
It is the quantum of energy.

428
00:26:07.371 --> 00:26:09.170
It is the smallest quantum of energy.

429
00:26:09.530 --> 00:26:14.530
So it turns out quantum mechanics is that the photon in this case will be

430
00:26:15.020 --> 00:26:20.020
reflected with 50% probability and transmitted with 50% probability when it hits

431
00:26:20.601 --> 00:26:21.200
a beam splitter.

432
00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:25.610
So basically it's either going to be reflected or transmitted and for any given

433
00:26:25.611 --> 00:26:27.470
for 20,
you can't tell what it will do.

434
00:26:27.620 --> 00:26:31.310
But if you send thousands and thousands on average halfway you go one way,
half,

435
00:26:31.311 --> 00:26:32.450
we'll go the other way,
right?

436
00:26:32.690 --> 00:26:36.920
So we can now put detectors at the end of these paths and these detectors are

437
00:26:36.921 --> 00:26:40.340
going to click half the time for,
uh,

438
00:26:40.460 --> 00:26:43.970
the photon being reflected half the time for the photons transmitted,
right?

439
00:26:44.430 --> 00:26:49.430
So we can now sort of make this a configuration a little bit bigger.

440
00:26:52.140 --> 00:26:52.491
All.

441
00:26:52.491 --> 00:26:55.950
All that this figure has done is it has turned the paths of the two beams are

442
00:26:55.951 --> 00:26:57.870
dry tangles.
It's still the same.

443
00:26:58.080 --> 00:27:02.870
A photon goes into the first beam splitter and then ends up either in Detector d

444
00:27:02.871 --> 00:27:07.871
one or ends up in detector d two so if you were to send 10,000 photons into this

445
00:27:08.941 --> 00:27:13.890
beam splitter,
one by one by one on average,
5,000 are going to be reflected.

446
00:27:14.010 --> 00:27:15.870
5,000 are going to be transmitted.

447
00:27:16.350 --> 00:27:19.230
It's five and a half the time the one we'll click half the time,

448
00:27:19.231 --> 00:27:23.430
d two will click right?
This is a very,
you can do this in the lab.

449
00:27:23.460 --> 00:27:24.690
This will happen all the time.

450
00:27:25.140 --> 00:27:29.670
Here's what happens when you complete the marks and the interferometer.

451
00:27:29.671 --> 00:27:31.350
Something very,
very intriguing happens.

452
00:27:31.351 --> 00:27:35.460
If you put another bean splitter exactly at the place where the two beams cross

453
00:27:35.940 --> 00:27:39.990
right now,
if,
if Dee one clicks,
right,

454
00:27:40.290 --> 00:27:43.710
if you look at the previous figure it right,

455
00:27:44.100 --> 00:27:46.800
if dyn clicks here,
if the detector Dijuan clicks,

456
00:27:46.801 --> 00:27:50.700
it's very clear that the photon took the reflected,
but if d two clicks,

457
00:27:50.701 --> 00:27:53.120
it's very clear that the photon took the transmitted path.

458
00:27:53.850 --> 00:27:56.640
But in the full interferometer.
Now

459
00:27:58.170 --> 00:28:01.740
the photon is reflected by refracted or transmitted by the first beam splitter,

460
00:28:01.770 --> 00:28:05.580
and it also reflected and transmitted by the second beam splitter.
Now,

461
00:28:05.581 --> 00:28:09.900
so if now d one clicks,
can you tell which path it took?

462
00:28:13.380 --> 00:28:14.213
<v 1>Any thoughts?</v>

463
00:28:17.430 --> 00:28:21.430
<v 2>So there's no way to tell,
right?
I mean,
if Devin,
if Devin clicks the Photon,</v>

464
00:28:21.450 --> 00:28:24.750
could I've been reflected first and transmitted next or it could have been

465
00:28:24.751 --> 00:28:29.500
transmitted first in reflected next,
right?
And now,
uh,

466
00:28:29.670 --> 00:28:34.380
if you send say 5,000 photons into this one by one,
what do you expect?

467
00:28:34.830 --> 00:28:39.730
If you do the numbers
previously,
remember we said half?
We'll,

468
00:28:39.731 --> 00:28:44.200
if we send 5,000 into it,
2,500,
we'll go to d one,
2,500,

469
00:28:44.201 --> 00:28:48.790
we'll go to d two on average.
Uh,
we can't tell what any single photon will do,

470
00:28:48.791 --> 00:28:50.620
but on average now,
what about this?
Now?

471
00:28:52.720 --> 00:28:53.553
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

472
00:28:55.340 --> 00:28:58.340
<v 2>where else would they go?
Right.
Your class.
But this is quantum mechanics.</v>

473
00:28:58.341 --> 00:29:00.410
This is a loaded question already,
right?
Uh,

474
00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:06.200
so who said all of it will go to don?
Yes.
So this is the weird part.

475
00:29:06.470 --> 00:29:11.240
All of them will go to [inaudible]
and this very,

476
00:29:11.241 --> 00:29:15.170
very simple device illustrates just how funky quantum mechanics is,
right?

477
00:29:15.410 --> 00:29:16.700
What's happening here.
If you,

478
00:29:16.701 --> 00:29:19.550
if you try to model mathematically what's happening here,

479
00:29:19.551 --> 00:29:22.730
the wave function of the photon.
Remember some mathematical abstraction,

480
00:29:22.731 --> 00:29:27.020
which we don't know whether it's real or not enters the first bring sweeter it.

481
00:29:27.021 --> 00:29:29.210
Now part of it is going to be transmitted,

482
00:29:29.390 --> 00:29:33.080
part of it is going to be reflected and it's going to continue on those two

483
00:29:33.081 --> 00:29:36.470
parts.
And then at the second being sweeter,
each component,

484
00:29:36.650 --> 00:29:39.830
the reflected component is again going to be reflected and transmitted.

485
00:29:40.190 --> 00:29:43.370
The transmitted component is going to be again,
reflected and transmitted,
right?

486
00:29:43.870 --> 00:29:48.870
So if you now look at d one d one is going to be the the combination in terms of

487
00:29:50.201 --> 00:29:53.290
the way function.
We're not thinking of the 400 right now,
but we have to explain.

488
00:29:53.380 --> 00:29:56.440
So if you did this experimentally,
if you just did this in the lab,

489
00:29:57.070 --> 00:29:59.590
all of the photons are going to go to [inaudible] none.

490
00:29:59.591 --> 00:30:04.060
We'll go to d two as long as the path between the two beam splitters is exactly

491
00:30:04.061 --> 00:30:06.760
the same,
all of them will go to dyn.
None.

492
00:30:06.761 --> 00:30:09.850
We go to d two and that's a really counter intuitive result that you need to

493
00:30:09.851 --> 00:30:12.040
explain the mathematics explains it,
right?

494
00:30:12.041 --> 00:30:14.830
So basically now you have to think in terms of the way function,

495
00:30:14.831 --> 00:30:18.850
the way function has split into two the first beam splitter and then split into

496
00:30:18.851 --> 00:30:21.190
two.
Again,
each component splits into two again.

497
00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:26.110
And then on the way to d one there are two components of the wave function that

498
00:30:26.111 --> 00:30:29.740
are recombining and on the way to d to the two components of recombining.

499
00:30:30.310 --> 00:30:35.310
But it turns out that when you're going towards d one the two components of the

500
00:30:35.561 --> 00:30:36.101
wave function,

501
00:30:36.101 --> 00:30:39.370
one which has been reflected and then transmit it and the other which has been

502
00:30:39.371 --> 00:30:42.730
transmitted and then reflected,
remember we're talking a waves,

503
00:30:43.240 --> 00:30:47.590
even though when in mathematical space these waves are in phase because they

504
00:30:47.591 --> 00:30:50.650
haven't,
they have endured the same amount of reflection and transmission.

505
00:30:50.651 --> 00:30:54.990
So they're actually in phase.
So these two waves mathematically are,

506
00:30:55.810 --> 00:30:58.660
you know,
they are in phase and they constructively interfere.

507
00:30:58.960 --> 00:31:02.650
Whereas the waves that are going towards d two uh,

508
00:31:02.770 --> 00:31:05.350
has endured to reflections in two transmissions.

509
00:31:06.010 --> 00:31:10.360
So one component is lagging the other in face by one 80 decrees,

510
00:31:10.390 --> 00:31:12.670
the crests of one way or lining up with the trough.

511
00:31:12.970 --> 00:31:16.870
That's destructive interference.
So in that mathematical configuration space,

512
00:31:16.871 --> 00:31:21.871
the way functions have interfered so that all of the stuff is going to d one and

513
00:31:23.231 --> 00:31:27.370
none is going to d two but remember this is happening in abstract mathematical

514
00:31:27.371 --> 00:31:29.710
space,
but this is representing the photon.

515
00:31:29.830 --> 00:31:32.710
So the photon always goes to d one none.

516
00:31:32.711 --> 00:31:36.130
We'll go to d two and you can mess with these numbers by changing the lens of

517
00:31:36.131 --> 00:31:38.350
the paths between the two beans leaders.
But for now,

518
00:31:38.351 --> 00:31:39.640
if you think of them as equal,

519
00:31:40.150 --> 00:31:43.810
then d one represents constructive interference d to represent destructive

520
00:31:43.811 --> 00:31:47.230
interference.
No photon would go to d two right?

521
00:31:47.650 --> 00:31:52.090
This does not make classical logical sense,
but it,

522
00:31:52.300 --> 00:31:53.860
that's how the quantum world works.

523
00:31:53.890 --> 00:31:57.310
And you can only explain this if you're thinking in terms of the way function

524
00:31:57.610 --> 00:32:01.720
and what's happening to the wave function.
Right?
Uh,
but the question remained,

525
00:32:01.721 --> 00:32:06.520
what is the status of the wave function?
Is it real?
Right?
So if you,

526
00:32:06.521 --> 00:32:09.850
for instance now put a block in one of these arms,

527
00:32:10.360 --> 00:32:11.890
what do you think will happen now?

528
00:32:11.891 --> 00:32:16.030
Let's say we send 5,004 tons into the first beam splitter,

529
00:32:16.300 --> 00:32:18.730
but there's a block in one of them,
one of the arms,

530
00:32:19.060 --> 00:32:20.020
what do you think might happen?

531
00:32:21.730 --> 00:32:22.563
<v 1>Sorry,</v>

532
00:32:24.140 --> 00:32:27.890
<v 2>half and half.
But what happens to the numbers?
So you sent 5,000 into the,</v>

533
00:32:30.990 --> 00:32:35.940
so it turns out that the block will cut down the number of photons by half,

534
00:32:36.900 --> 00:32:40.040
but now w the function that is,

535
00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:43.790
so it's cutting down the wave function component that's going along one path.

536
00:32:44.300 --> 00:32:46.850
So nothing is going to progress along that path.

537
00:32:47.510 --> 00:32:51.200
The way function that goes on the other path is now hitting the second beam

538
00:32:51.201 --> 00:32:51.950
splitter.

539
00:32:51.950 --> 00:32:54.830
But now if there's no interference because nothing coming from the other side.

540
00:32:55.100 --> 00:32:57.770
So now it's just acting like before it,
half of it goes one way.

541
00:32:57.771 --> 00:33:00.520
Half of it goes the other way.
So if you send 5,000 euros,

542
00:33:00.560 --> 00:33:05.560
half will go to d one half of you go to d two but half of two 5,000 so 2,500 are

543
00:33:06.741 --> 00:33:07.574
blocked.

544
00:33:07.610 --> 00:33:11.810
The other 2,500 we'll hit the second gleaned sputter and then go half on one

545
00:33:11.811 --> 00:33:15.230
half of the way.
This is now showing you that there's no interference.

546
00:33:15.620 --> 00:33:17.690
Putting that block is very,

547
00:33:17.830 --> 00:33:20.570
is analogous to trying to see which way the photon is going.

548
00:33:21.030 --> 00:33:23.780
Right in the double slit.
If you blocked one of the slits,

549
00:33:24.500 --> 00:33:28.040
this is analogous to that.
You're basically saying I'm blocking one of the slits.

550
00:33:28.670 --> 00:33:31.670
I know now that the photon has to go through the other slate.
Well,
it,
yeah,

551
00:33:31.671 --> 00:33:33.830
it does go through the other slip and there's no interference.

552
00:33:34.280 --> 00:33:38.420
In this case it becomes a very clear demonstration of the lack of interference.

553
00:33:38.421 --> 00:33:40.700
When you block one slip,
you open word slits.

554
00:33:41.240 --> 00:33:44.420
Certainly all the photons will go to Dee Dee one.
None of them will go to d two.

555
00:33:45.050 --> 00:33:50.040
Right?
So this is showing you interference or what other,

556
00:33:50.070 --> 00:33:52.310
this is showing you the photons particle like behavior.

557
00:33:52.340 --> 00:33:54.380
It's acting like a particle.
There's no interference.

558
00:33:54.620 --> 00:33:56.540
But the moment you remove that block moment,

559
00:33:56.541 --> 00:33:59.390
you don't try to see which part the photon is taking.

560
00:34:00.260 --> 00:34:02.810
The system seems to behave like a wave and you get interference.

561
00:34:03.500 --> 00:34:08.500
So now I want to sort of talk about how this simple thing can help you solve the

562
00:34:08.961 --> 00:34:13.580
elixir vitamin bomb puzzle.
So to,
to,
uh,

563
00:34:13.790 --> 00:34:16.730
let me just tell you about the bomb puzzle again.
What was the question?

564
00:34:16.731 --> 00:34:20.550
The question is there's a factory that's making bombs,
uh,

565
00:34:20.570 --> 00:34:23.180
and these bombs are triggered through extremely sensitive,

566
00:34:23.660 --> 00:34:27.590
so sensitive that even a single particle of light falling on it will detonate

567
00:34:27.591 --> 00:34:28.424
the bomb.

568
00:34:28.610 --> 00:34:33.470
The problem is that the factory is also producing duds bombs without triggers,

569
00:34:33.920 --> 00:34:34.580
right?

570
00:34:34.580 --> 00:34:39.580
So your task is to figure out which bombs have sensitive functioning triggers

571
00:34:40.281 --> 00:34:44.720
and which are the duds.
Now,
in our classical way of thinking about this problem,

572
00:34:44.721 --> 00:34:48.200
if you were to look at the bom to see if it has a trigger,
it'll explode.

573
00:34:48.201 --> 00:34:51.740
Because looking in walls,
shining light or something,

574
00:34:52.010 --> 00:34:55.830
you'll have to use some energy to look at it.
And so,
you know,

575
00:34:55.880 --> 00:34:58.130
even a single photon will detonate the bomb.

576
00:34:58.131 --> 00:35:01.880
So there's no way classically in our classical way of thinking,

577
00:35:02.090 --> 00:35:06.650
no way to solve this problem.
But you can solve this problem.
You can find out,

578
00:35:07.130 --> 00:35:11.660
you can distinguish the dots from the live bombs using this Marcus,

579
00:35:11.680 --> 00:35:15.830
under interferometer,
you're allowed to detonate some bombs.
So can you now,

580
00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:19.730
so what happened?
Now say I have placed this bomb.

581
00:35:19.860 --> 00:35:22.970
There's assume that all of this is being done in a dark room with robots and

582
00:35:23.180 --> 00:35:26.900
you're not worried about blowing up the bombs because of handling them.

583
00:35:27.260 --> 00:35:31.880
So let's assume that we can place the one right next to one path and this one

584
00:35:31.881 --> 00:35:34.850
doesn't have a trigger.
And now you start sending in photons to this,

585
00:35:35.030 --> 00:35:38.640
through this.
Apart as to this interferometer,
what do you expect?

586
00:35:40.020 --> 00:35:43.650
So 10,000 photons are going in,
or do you expect

587
00:35:45.160 --> 00:35:46.490
where,
where would the photons go?

588
00:35:50.170 --> 00:35:51.003
<v 1>Okay.</v>

589
00:35:51.480 --> 00:35:54.030
<v 2>There's no difference between the previous,
you know,</v>

590
00:35:54.031 --> 00:35:58.380
there's no difference between this and this because the bomb was just sitting

591
00:35:58.381 --> 00:36:01.830
there and the it has no trigger.
There's no obstruction,
right?

592
00:36:01.950 --> 00:36:05.100
So this should just behave like a regular marks under interferometer.

593
00:36:05.310 --> 00:36:09.570
All of the photon should end up at d one non non should go to d two.
Right?

594
00:36:09.930 --> 00:36:13.590
So you really can't tell anything at this point.
Uh,

595
00:36:13.920 --> 00:36:16.170
so let's say you did,
you know,
you're,

596
00:36:16.171 --> 00:36:19.380
you're trying to do this within a statistical sense.
You say,

597
00:36:19.530 --> 00:36:22.890
I'm going to send a million photons into this,
which you can do in labs.
These,

598
00:36:22.891 --> 00:36:26.820
this very quickly,
all of them will go to d one.
None.
We'll go to d two.

599
00:36:26.850 --> 00:36:31.090
That's a very,
very good indication that you haven't done next to interferometer.

600
00:36:31.740 --> 00:36:36.600
Now,
if you have a live bomb,
right?
Life meaning a trigger that will actually,

601
00:36:36.750 --> 00:36:39.840
it's plays to sorta little obstructs the photon path.

602
00:36:40.710 --> 00:36:44.280
Now what happens now you start sending in one 41 at a time.

603
00:36:48.590 --> 00:36:53.270
Yeah.
So this,
this trigger now his,
like the block that we put earlier,

604
00:36:53.780 --> 00:36:55.790
right?
Remember there was,
uh,
we,
we had,
uh,

605
00:36:56.390 --> 00:36:58.940
we had this set up where if we put a block,

606
00:36:59.300 --> 00:37:01.400
that block is going to obstruct half the photons.

607
00:37:02.180 --> 00:37:04.970
So this trigger now is like that block.

608
00:37:05.510 --> 00:37:10.510
Half the time the photons are going to hit this block and half the time the bomb

609
00:37:11.601 --> 00:37:15.800
is going to detonate.
So it'll blow up,
blow the bomb,
the bomb will blow up.

610
00:37:15.801 --> 00:37:19.050
So will the Max under interferometer,
you'd have to rebuild it.
A zoom.

611
00:37:19.051 --> 00:37:23.150
We can do all that.
This is a thought experiment so you can do all this.
Okay.

612
00:37:23.210 --> 00:37:27.080
So half the time the whole setup will blow up the other half of the time.

613
00:37:27.081 --> 00:37:27.920
It's interesting part,

614
00:37:28.520 --> 00:37:31.370
the other half of the time the wave function is going through the other side,

615
00:37:32.150 --> 00:37:34.560
right?
It's,
it's going through the other side.

616
00:37:34.561 --> 00:37:37.670
He hits the second beam splitter and then what happens?

617
00:37:41.950 --> 00:37:45.790
Yes.
So in this case,
half the photons will end up in d two,
right?

618
00:37:46.120 --> 00:37:51.120
So if you send 5,004 tons in 2,500 of them on average will blow up the whole

619
00:37:51.161 --> 00:37:51.640
thing.

620
00:37:51.640 --> 00:37:56.590
The other 2,500 will get split up at the second half of them will go to d two

621
00:37:56.591 --> 00:38:00.520
and half of them will go to d one if they go to d one it's kind of inconclusive

622
00:38:00.521 --> 00:38:03.160
because you know the one was happening previously also.

623
00:38:03.400 --> 00:38:08.400
But if any photon ends up in d two that's a sign that there's a live bomb in the

624
00:38:09.221 --> 00:38:11.800
other path.
But here's the interesting thing.

625
00:38:11.860 --> 00:38:15.130
You haven't interacted with the light bulb because if you had interacted with

626
00:38:15.131 --> 00:38:19.900
the light bomb,
it would have blown up.
No,
but if,
if,

627
00:38:19.901 --> 00:38:22.630
if it goes to d two you know there's a live bomb,

628
00:38:22.631 --> 00:38:25.360
you can just pick that up and say,
okay,
this is what we're going to ship now.

629
00:38:25.730 --> 00:38:29.890
Right?
Building half the bonds and quarter of them are short.
Yeah,

630
00:38:29.891 --> 00:38:32.860
you can work out the probability.
So this is the bare minimum and you can,

631
00:38:32.861 --> 00:38:35.890
you can fine tune this experiment to improve that.
Right.

632
00:38:36.250 --> 00:38:37.840
But the idea here is something very,

633
00:38:37.841 --> 00:38:42.370
very profound that quantum mechanics has allowed you to detect the presence of

634
00:38:42.371 --> 00:38:43.900
something without interacting with it.

635
00:38:44.080 --> 00:38:45.850
These are called interaction free measurements.

636
00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:48.400
It does not happen in classical physics.

637
00:38:48.401 --> 00:38:51.850
You cannot measure something without interacting with it.

638
00:38:52.270 --> 00:38:56.230
Here we have physically interact with physically is a different truck.

639
00:38:56.590 --> 00:38:59.140
Some interaction,
something has interacted with the bomb.

640
00:39:00.220 --> 00:39:03.340
The photon hasn't because otherwise the bomb would have exploded.
Right?

641
00:39:04.030 --> 00:39:08.200
But something interacted with the bomb and we got information about the one

642
00:39:08.201 --> 00:39:11.980
without actually blowing it up.
So this is an interaction free measurement.

643
00:39:11.981 --> 00:39:12.371
This is,

644
00:39:12.371 --> 00:39:16.210
this makes the case for the reality of the wave function as if the wave function

645
00:39:16.211 --> 00:39:18.490
is the probably the way function that is sensing

646
00:39:19.040 --> 00:39:20.330
<v 3>the bomb.
Right?</v>

647
00:39:21.590 --> 00:39:23.900
<v 2>This argument can go round and round and round.</v>

648
00:39:24.290 --> 00:39:28.310
<v 3>Yeah.
That makes me think of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle,
right?</v>

649
00:39:33.590 --> 00:39:36.950
<v 2>Heisenberg uncertainty principle.
Very much.
We will come back to questions.</v>

650
00:39:37.040 --> 00:39:39.170
So why don't we just wait for the queen.

651
00:39:39.200 --> 00:39:40.970
I'll just finish up and then we'll come back.
I,
in fact,

652
00:39:40.971 --> 00:39:43.560
I just talk about that principle,
so,

653
00:39:44.840 --> 00:39:45.400
<v 3>okay.</v>

654
00:39:45.400 --> 00:39:48.820
<v 2>Yeah.
Um,
I mean this is,
this is an example of how this,
you know,</v>

655
00:39:49.270 --> 00:39:52.030
this is a very special case of the double slit experiment.

656
00:39:52.031 --> 00:39:55.480
This is the experiment that is done in labs on optical benchers.
It's very,

657
00:39:55.481 --> 00:39:58.850
very easy to configure and work with.
And much of,

658
00:39:59.080 --> 00:40:02.200
when physicists say that they're doing a double slit experiment these days,

659
00:40:02.440 --> 00:40:05.320
they're more often than not building a magazine,

660
00:40:05.330 --> 00:40:07.180
the interferometer and working with it.

661
00:40:07.210 --> 00:40:10.970
And there are variations of this in many forms and,

662
00:40:11.190 --> 00:40:15.070
and it's amazing how this one simple experiment allows you to understand some of

663
00:40:15.071 --> 00:40:18.610
the very,
very basic issues in quantum mechanics.
Like superposition.

664
00:40:19.210 --> 00:40:21.760
Superposition is this idea that we just talked about,

665
00:40:21.761 --> 00:40:25.720
that the photon can end up being in two parts at once.
It doesn't make any sense.

666
00:40:25.721 --> 00:40:29.230
So it,
there's a mathematical,
uh,
is sort of,
you know,

667
00:40:29.260 --> 00:40:30.880
mathematical way of representing it.

668
00:40:31.060 --> 00:40:35.020
The way of talking about it is to say that the photon is in a superposition of

669
00:40:35.021 --> 00:40:37.540
taking both parts.
It's not the same as taking,

670
00:40:37.570 --> 00:40:40.450
it's not the same as saying the photon is actually taking both parts.

671
00:40:40.840 --> 00:40:45.640
It's just a way of saying that the quantum states are such that hit behaves as

672
00:40:45.641 --> 00:40:48.190
if it is taking both paths.
So it's,

673
00:40:48.250 --> 00:40:50.170
it's the way function that's taking both parts,

674
00:40:50.171 --> 00:40:53.400
but we don't know what the ontological status of the wave function is.

675
00:40:53.401 --> 00:40:56.050
So it's not the same as saying the photon is taking both paths.

676
00:40:56.410 --> 00:41:00.540
The uncertainty principle,
right?
This,
these experiments allow you to,
um,

677
00:41:00.850 --> 00:41:02.260
talk about the uncertainty principle,

678
00:41:02.261 --> 00:41:06.610
which is the simple idea that there are certain parameters in quantum mechanics

679
00:41:06.611 --> 00:41:09.280
in,
in particular the position and momentum of a particle.

680
00:41:09.550 --> 00:41:14.110
You cannot measure both,
uh,
sort of accurately.

681
00:41:14.111 --> 00:41:17.080
If you measure one very accurately the you mess up the other one.

682
00:41:17.350 --> 00:41:20.200
So the more precisely you measure the position of a particle,

683
00:41:20.620 --> 00:41:23.890
the more uncertain the momentum and vice versa.

684
00:41:23.920 --> 00:41:25.780
So that's the uncertainty principle.

685
00:41:25.781 --> 00:41:28.450
There's complementarity or wave particle duality.

686
00:41:28.480 --> 00:41:32.200
Complimentarity being the idea that nature has two phases,

687
00:41:32.230 --> 00:41:35.270
the wave nature and particle nature,
uh,

688
00:41:35.271 --> 00:41:37.520
and you can only absorb one or the other.

689
00:41:37.521 --> 00:41:40.400
And what you observed depends on the parameters that you've built.

690
00:41:40.580 --> 00:41:43.700
So we saw that there were different configurations of that interferometer that

691
00:41:43.701 --> 00:41:47.030
you can build,
which will either show you the particle nature or the wave nature,

692
00:41:47.270 --> 00:41:51.830
but you can't see both at the same time.
Determinism versus non-determinism,
we,

693
00:41:52.030 --> 00:41:55.340
uh,
classical physics is deterministic.
So,
you know,

694
00:41:55.341 --> 00:41:58.850
if you throw a ball and you know all the forces that are acting on it,
uh,

695
00:41:58.851 --> 00:42:03.230
you can predict exactly where it will go and uh,
and the trajectory of the ball.

696
00:42:03.620 --> 00:42:07.910
Whereas here,
when you're talking of a photon going through the double slit,

697
00:42:08.420 --> 00:42:10.340
you can only talk in terms of probably it is,

698
00:42:10.341 --> 00:42:12.950
you can only assign probabilities to where it'll end up.

699
00:42:13.400 --> 00:42:17.970
There is no clear trajectory that you can map out that the photon takes and,

700
00:42:18.740 --> 00:42:19.340
and you,

701
00:42:19.340 --> 00:42:23.150
and basically this whole system is non deterministic and you can talk about

702
00:42:23.151 --> 00:42:26.750
determinism versus non-determinism in the context of the double slit experiment.

703
00:42:27.230 --> 00:42:30.230
The biggest problem really is this thing called the collapse of the wave

704
00:42:30.231 --> 00:42:30.650
function.

705
00:42:30.650 --> 00:42:34.580
Remember the way function goes through both slits interferes and on the other

706
00:42:34.581 --> 00:42:36.560
side you get this way.

707
00:42:36.561 --> 00:42:40.520
We think that tells you mathematically what are the chances of finding the

708
00:42:40.521 --> 00:42:43.850
photon here versus here versus here.
So,
and if you did a measurement,

709
00:42:43.851 --> 00:42:46.790
it'll end up in one of those places until you did a measurement.

710
00:42:47.270 --> 00:42:51.020
The probabilities existed in this,
uh,
in this wave function.

711
00:42:51.021 --> 00:42:52.460
But the moment you do the measurement,

712
00:42:52.640 --> 00:42:55.100
the wave function collapses and peaks at one point.

713
00:42:55.250 --> 00:42:57.260
The problem with these go to zero everywhere and become,

714
00:42:57.290 --> 00:43:01.700
it becomes one at the point where it's measured,
uh,
or where it's found.

715
00:43:02.030 --> 00:43:06.410
So,
and there is nothing in quantum mechanics that tells you what this collapse

716
00:43:06.411 --> 00:43:08.870
really is.
It's just,
it's a postulate.

717
00:43:08.930 --> 00:43:12.440
It's a postulate is an axiom in quantum mechanics that says when you do a

718
00:43:12.441 --> 00:43:16.510
measurement,
the wave function collapses.
We don't know the,
you know,

719
00:43:16.780 --> 00:43:19.430
what the wave function really is in terms of its reality.

720
00:43:19.640 --> 00:43:24.200
We don't know what the actual process of collapses and this thing is called the

721
00:43:24.201 --> 00:43:24.981
measurement problem.

722
00:43:24.981 --> 00:43:29.870
The idea that measurement causes collapse without being able to define what a

723
00:43:29.871 --> 00:43:32.780
measurement really is is the cause of many,

724
00:43:32.781 --> 00:43:34.880
many conceptual problems within quantum mechanics.

725
00:43:34.881 --> 00:43:38.930
And a lot of the alternatives to standard quantum mechanics that you hear about

726
00:43:39.620 --> 00:43:43.580
are alternatives that are trying to solve the measurement problem.
Uh,

727
00:43:43.610 --> 00:43:47.570
there's realism versus non realism realism being this idea that there is an

728
00:43:47.571 --> 00:43:52.310
objective reality that exists independent of observation that you don't need to

729
00:43:52.311 --> 00:43:56.150
be observing in order to know that there is a reality out there.

730
00:43:56.480 --> 00:43:57.470
Quantum mechanics,

731
00:43:57.500 --> 00:44:01.430
at least the standard way of thinking about quantum mechanics questions that the

732
00:44:01.431 --> 00:44:06.431
photon in this case doesn't have a reality until you observe it because there is

733
00:44:07.701 --> 00:44:11.510
nothing in the mathematics that captures the trajectory of the photon from the

734
00:44:11.511 --> 00:44:14.900
source to the detector.
That is,
you know,
you cannot,

735
00:44:14.930 --> 00:44:17.210
you cannot calculate the trajectory.
He could end up,

736
00:44:17.220 --> 00:44:20.120
we could have five different trajectories or any number of trajectories that

737
00:44:20.121 --> 00:44:20.960
there's no way to tell.

738
00:44:21.500 --> 00:44:25.280
The only reality ascribed to the photon is at the point of creation handed the

739
00:44:25.281 --> 00:44:26.800
point of observation.
Right?

740
00:44:27.020 --> 00:44:30.020
So in one way of thinking of our standard quantum mechanics,

741
00:44:30.021 --> 00:44:33.690
it actually denies reality until observation.

742
00:44:33.691 --> 00:44:37.860
So it is an observer dependent,
a theoretical framework.

743
00:44:37.920 --> 00:44:41.940
I mean there are lots of
issues with this.

744
00:44:41.941 --> 00:44:45.300
People debate this endlessly over and over again as to as that word is really

745
00:44:45.301 --> 00:44:48.690
saying.
But one way of interpreting standard quantum mechanics is to say there is

746
00:44:48.691 --> 00:44:51.930
anterior list.
Um,
then the questions about the wave function,

747
00:44:51.931 --> 00:44:53.400
which I just told you about.

748
00:44:53.460 --> 00:44:57.450
Is it really something that exists or is it representative of something that

749
00:44:57.451 --> 00:45:00.030
actually exists or is it just our knowledge,

750
00:45:00.270 --> 00:45:02.370
half-baked knowledge about what's happening,
right?

751
00:45:02.400 --> 00:45:03.870
Is it epistemic or is it on tape?

752
00:45:04.350 --> 00:45:07.020
I haven't even touched upon the other big issue in quantum mechanics,

753
00:45:07.021 --> 00:45:09.930
but the double slit experiment allows you to talk about that also,

754
00:45:10.170 --> 00:45:12.600
which has to do with entanglement or nonlocality.

755
00:45:12.630 --> 00:45:16.290
The idea that if there are two quantum systems that are,
uh,

756
00:45:16.350 --> 00:45:20.160
that have somehow interacted at some point,
once they've interacted,

757
00:45:20.161 --> 00:45:23.040
they are now represented by the same way function.

758
00:45:23.041 --> 00:45:24.600
And this way function starts spreading,

759
00:45:25.110 --> 00:45:29.400
which means that maybe the particles are going apart and if you do a measurement

760
00:45:29.401 --> 00:45:30.181
on one particle,

761
00:45:30.181 --> 00:45:33.390
you can instantly influence the state of the other particle even if these things

762
00:45:33.391 --> 00:45:37.590
are kilometers apart.
And that cuts against,
uh,

763
00:45:37.950 --> 00:45:41.190
the idea of locality,
which is the bedrock of relativity,

764
00:45:41.191 --> 00:45:45.150
which is the idea that what you do in one region of spacetime cannot influence

765
00:45:45.151 --> 00:45:46.450
something else,
uh,

766
00:45:46.500 --> 00:45:49.560
in another region of space time any faster than the speed of light.

767
00:45:50.130 --> 00:45:52.710
Quantum mechanics apparently,
uh,

768
00:45:52.770 --> 00:45:55.830
suggest that there is instantaneous influence.

769
00:45:56.580 --> 00:46:00.550
Action in one region can instantly influenced the state of some other system,
uh,

770
00:46:01.140 --> 00:46:03.840
and faster than the speed of light.
So again,

771
00:46:03.841 --> 00:46:06.090
there are debates about whether that's really what it's saying,

772
00:46:06.091 --> 00:46:10.350
but there's enough proof that that the underlying quantum reality is indeed

773
00:46:10.351 --> 00:46:15.000
nonlocal.
Okay.
And the double seat and its variations.
I just showed you one,

774
00:46:15.030 --> 00:46:17.340
the magazine,
the interferometer,
there are many,

775
00:46:17.341 --> 00:46:20.250
many experiments that have been done that play on this principle.

776
00:46:20.490 --> 00:46:22.410
There's the wheelers delayed choice experiment.

777
00:46:22.411 --> 00:46:25.920
I don't think we have time to go through any,
I just named them.

778
00:46:25.950 --> 00:46:29.580
And when you see them,
you'll realize when you see them in literature elsewhere,

779
00:46:29.581 --> 00:46:32.740
you realize that these are all variations of the double set,

780
00:46:32.760 --> 00:46:35.120
the quantum razor experiment,
delay,
choice quantum.

781
00:46:35.121 --> 00:46:37.560
It is the interaction free measurements we just talked about.

782
00:46:38.150 --> 00:46:41.340
There are experiments that have actually tried to measure particle trajectories.

783
00:46:41.370 --> 00:46:45.360
I actually told you just now that you can't talk about trajectories in Spenard

784
00:46:45.361 --> 00:46:48.540
quantum mechanics,
but there are other interpretations,

785
00:46:48.541 --> 00:46:52.080
other quantum formalisms that allow you to talk of trajectories and there are

786
00:46:52.081 --> 00:46:55.530
ways in which you can measure them and they're very controversial.

787
00:46:55.531 --> 00:46:58.230
But nonetheless you can do double slit experiments where you can map these

788
00:46:58.231 --> 00:47:01.770
trajectories,
you can probe the divide between the quantum and the classical.

789
00:47:01.980 --> 00:47:06.210
Is is the world of quantum all the way through or is there some divide where the

790
00:47:06.211 --> 00:47:08.280
quantum world gives away to the classical world?

791
00:47:08.310 --> 00:47:09.690
We don't know the answer to that yet.

792
00:47:10.320 --> 00:47:13.890
And there are a whole range of other things you can do that probe sort of

793
00:47:13.891 --> 00:47:18.000
conceptual issues in quantum mechanics all using the double slit experiment.
And,

794
00:47:18.180 --> 00:47:22.290
and my entire book is basically an exploration of how this double slit

795
00:47:22.300 --> 00:47:26.710
experiment has been used for all these purposes.
And I talk about,
uh,

796
00:47:27.390 --> 00:47:30.340
five particular five interpretations,
the Copenhagen Interpretation,

797
00:47:30.341 --> 00:47:35.110
which is a standard quantum mechanics interpreted in by the people who started

798
00:47:35.111 --> 00:47:36.650
in Copenhagen,
Niels Bohr and

799
00:47:38.320 --> 00:47:42.330
Heisenberg and uh,
and a whole bunch of other people who've kind of polio.

800
00:47:42.331 --> 00:47:45.070
All these people were involved in,
uh,
an interpretation,

801
00:47:45.071 --> 00:47:47.260
which is now called the Copenhagen interpretation.

802
00:47:47.350 --> 00:47:49.390
There's the de Broglie Bohm interpretation,

803
00:47:49.391 --> 00:47:52.300
which is a very different view of the quantum world,

804
00:47:52.301 --> 00:47:55.600
which basically says the quantum world is both a wave and the particle,

805
00:47:55.840 --> 00:47:59.440
I don't think we have time to go into the details.
There are collapsed series.

806
00:47:59.620 --> 00:48:03.880
So I talked about how the collapse happens because of measurement and it puts

807
00:48:03.881 --> 00:48:06.160
observers at the center of everything.

808
00:48:06.580 --> 00:48:08.620
But there are theories which removed the observer.

809
00:48:08.621 --> 00:48:11.890
They basically cause collapse stochastically and then lead to the same

810
00:48:11.891 --> 00:48:12.724
predictions.

811
00:48:13.030 --> 00:48:15.970
And then there are people who take the wave function really seriously.

812
00:48:15.971 --> 00:48:19.120
They basically say that the wave function splits and never collapses.

813
00:48:19.121 --> 00:48:22.720
And each splitting wave function is,
has given rise to a different world.

814
00:48:23.110 --> 00:48:27.010
So essentially every time a photon go through a beam splitter and goes left and

815
00:48:27.011 --> 00:48:29.020
goes right,
you have created two universities,

816
00:48:29.021 --> 00:48:30.880
one universe in which the four don went left,

817
00:48:31.180 --> 00:48:35.830
one photon in which it at one universe in which it went right and so on.
So,

818
00:48:36.070 --> 00:48:37.960
and then there's something about quantum Bayesianism,

819
00:48:37.961 --> 00:48:41.530
which is actually quite a complicated one to discuss here,
you know,
easily.

820
00:48:41.590 --> 00:48:45.310
But anyway,
these are the interpretations are dealing with in the book.
Um,

821
00:48:45.610 --> 00:48:50.350
so yeah,
I think I'll stop here and take questions.
I hope that was informative.

822
00:48:51.150 --> 00:48:51.983
<v 1>Thank you.</v>

823
00:49:00.450 --> 00:49:04.470
<v 2>Much of what you spoke about.
I think,
uh,
the,</v>

824
00:49:05.040 --> 00:49:08.940
the kind of questions that were raised with poverty,

825
00:49:09.330 --> 00:49:12.960
I don't even probably say back in the fifties or sixties.
Yeah,
yeah.

826
00:49:13.680 --> 00:49:17.100
What has happened since then?
A good question.
Um,

827
00:49:17.550 --> 00:49:22.080
so since the mid thirties,
you know,
19,
late,

828
00:49:22.140 --> 00:49:24.000
late 19,
20 [inaudible] and early 1930,

829
00:49:24.010 --> 00:49:27.160
it was when the standard formulation of quantum mechanics,
uh,

830
00:49:27.200 --> 00:49:31.560
well I got formulated.
So,
uh,
people like mainly due to,
uh,

831
00:49:31.670 --> 00:49:34.570
one Ironman,
uh,
Paul Dirac and others,
you know,

832
00:49:34.571 --> 00:49:39.540
so the standard quantum mechanics that exists is basically due to them that by

833
00:49:39.541 --> 00:49:43.650
mid thirties was pretty much custom stone.
And then,
but you know,

834
00:49:43.651 --> 00:49:46.230
these conceptual issues,
like you say,
have been around,
I mean,

835
00:49:46.231 --> 00:49:47.850
they were around even before 1950s.

836
00:49:47.851 --> 00:49:52.170
Einstein was arguing against these things throughout his career in quantum

837
00:49:52.171 --> 00:49:54.330
mechanics.
Remember,
he's one of the founders of quantum mechanics,

838
00:49:54.660 --> 00:49:56.310
even though people don't,
you know,

839
00:49:56.370 --> 00:50:01.370
people ascribe to him his greatest achievements are usually thought of as,

840
00:50:01.860 --> 00:50:03.480
you know,
the theories of relativity.

841
00:50:03.680 --> 00:50:05.400
He is one of the founders of quantum mechanics.

842
00:50:05.401 --> 00:50:10.401
And he had serious issues with these sort of questions that were raised just

843
00:50:10.591 --> 00:50:14.520
now.
They haven't been solved.
So they issues remain.
The,

844
00:50:14.521 --> 00:50:18.210
the amazing thing about standard quantum mechanics is it is extremely
successful.

845
00:50:18.270 --> 00:50:19.970
These probabilistic predictions,
this,

846
00:50:20.140 --> 00:50:22.580
this mathematical framework that is used to make problems,

847
00:50:22.581 --> 00:50:27.550
he prediction is the most,
uh,
successful physical theory.
We,
I mean,

848
00:50:27.860 --> 00:50:29.350
everything,
like,
you know,

849
00:50:29.600 --> 00:50:32.300
all of the stuff that is happening right now with the electronics is happening

850
00:50:32.301 --> 00:50:36.200
because that theory works right.
Uh,
but nonetheless,

851
00:50:36.201 --> 00:50:39.650
he raises fundamental questions about the nature of reality.
We don't know.

852
00:50:39.710 --> 00:50:44.450
And so 1950 was the beginning of,
uh,
you know,
David booms ideas.

853
00:50:44.510 --> 00:50:48.380
1951 was when he came up with this,
uh,
Boomi and mechanics,

854
00:50:48.530 --> 00:50:52.010
but that has a precursor,
it goes back to de Broglie in 1927.

855
00:50:52.310 --> 00:50:57.310
So the theory now is called de Broglie Bohm where you have a particle which has

856
00:50:57.591 --> 00:51:01.670
got been guided by a wave.
And the way it is real in,
in Bermuda mechanics,

857
00:51:01.700 --> 00:51:04.310
except that again,
it doesn't move in three d space.

858
00:51:04.311 --> 00:51:08.300
It moves in this mathematical configuration space.
But in Bowman and mechanics,

859
00:51:08.301 --> 00:51:12.850
it is ascribed reality.
It is part of the ontology of the universe,
right?
And,

860
00:51:13.640 --> 00:51:18.410
and some,
somewhere in the 1980s collapsed theories came about.
So this idea that,

861
00:51:18.890 --> 00:51:19.221
you know,

862
00:51:19.221 --> 00:51:24.200
the way function can collapse spontaneously stochastically without observers,

863
00:51:24.201 --> 00:51:28.100
without measurement.
And so the,
and then there's Penrose,
Roger Penrose,
his ideas,

864
00:51:28.101 --> 00:51:32.060
which I didn't touch it touch upon.
Um,
it's not really mainstream,

865
00:51:32.061 --> 00:51:36.110
but he has some very interesting ideas about why gravity needs to be brought

866
00:51:36.111 --> 00:51:36.860
into the mix.

867
00:51:36.860 --> 00:51:40.820
So when you have two masters in super position of being here and here,

868
00:51:40.970 --> 00:51:45.620
his argument is that these two masses will curve spacetime differently.

869
00:51:45.680 --> 00:51:47.540
And then the two curvature of space time,

870
00:51:47.541 --> 00:51:50.650
we'll also be in super position of being in,
you know,

871
00:51:50.660 --> 00:51:53.810
in two different curvatures and that's unstable.
And He created,

872
00:51:53.820 --> 00:51:56.090
he figures out a reason,
you know,
uh,
sort of,
uh,

873
00:51:56.360 --> 00:51:58.970
he admitted himself that it's kind of rough calculations,

874
00:51:58.971 --> 00:52:03.050
but this instability of the two configurations of Space Time will lead to a

875
00:52:03.051 --> 00:52:05.750
spontaneous collapse,
right?
And of course,

876
00:52:05.900 --> 00:52:09.290
small particles will take forever to collapse,
but as something larger,

877
00:52:09.500 --> 00:52:14.210
like a cat will collapse immediately to either one or the other.
Um,
then,

878
00:52:14.270 --> 00:52:18.590
um,
then there's quantum Bayesianism,
which is very recent,
last 10,
15 years.

879
00:52:19.160 --> 00:52:20.960
So yeah,
so it's happening.

880
00:52:21.260 --> 00:52:25.460
The point is that these issues are not resolved because all of these

881
00:52:25.850 --> 00:52:29.720
formulations or interpretations make exactly the same predictions.

882
00:52:29.990 --> 00:52:33.080
They have to make the same predictions in order to Talley with experiments.

883
00:52:33.500 --> 00:52:35.180
Right?
So right now,
experimentally,

884
00:52:35.181 --> 00:52:38.180
you cannot distinguish between these formulations.

885
00:52:38.480 --> 00:52:41.270
So Boomi and mechanics and standard quantum mechanics make exactly the same

886
00:52:41.271 --> 00:52:45.320
predictions,
but they have very different view of what the underlying reality is.

887
00:52:49.900 --> 00:52:50.733
<v 1>Anyone else,</v>

888
00:52:55.950 --> 00:53:00.950
<v 2>I guess I'm following up on that or any of these interpretations like testable</v>

889
00:53:02.100 --> 00:53:04.650
or are they,
are they always just going to be pure guesses?

890
00:53:04.710 --> 00:53:07.980
Like I mean at this point,
uh,

891
00:53:08.320 --> 00:53:12.620
one our guesses right there,
they are a mathematical fit there.

892
00:53:12.650 --> 00:53:17.430
They're trying to so balmy and mechanics for instance,
uh,

893
00:53:18.150 --> 00:53:22.680
the underlying reality is considered to be particles that are being guided by

894
00:53:22.681 --> 00:53:23.220
waves.

895
00:53:23.220 --> 00:53:28.100
These waves are considered real except the waves move in configuration space and

896
00:53:28.101 --> 00:53:31.920
uh,
and uh,
it's,
it's kind of,

897
00:53:32.010 --> 00:53:35.310
it's forming the mathematics is formulated to make exactly the same predictions

898
00:53:35.311 --> 00:53:38.790
that standard quantum mechanics because otherwise it wouldn't be a valid theory.

899
00:53:39.090 --> 00:53:42.600
So right now there's no way to distinguish between standard quantum mechanics

900
00:53:42.601 --> 00:53:43.530
and Boomi and mechanics.

901
00:53:44.370 --> 00:53:48.360
Standard quantum mechanics has the other advantage that it has actually been,
um,

902
00:53:48.420 --> 00:53:49.990
you know,
pushed along if,
you know,

903
00:53:50.190 --> 00:53:53.550
it has been combined with special relativity to become quantum field theory and

904
00:53:53.551 --> 00:53:56.820
so on.
It's much,
it's pulling much harder to do that with Boomi and mechanics.

905
00:53:56.970 --> 00:54:01.200
So there are other issues that happen with these different interpretations that

906
00:54:01.201 --> 00:54:05.400
can lead to people believing in them or not believing in them.

907
00:54:05.410 --> 00:54:09.420
But right now,
uh,
I don't want to call it a matter of faith.

908
00:54:09.520 --> 00:54:13.080
I mean it is the,
it is solid mathematics and all of these things,

909
00:54:13.470 --> 00:54:17.280
but they're not in particularly distinguishable.
Excellent for collapse.
Series.

910
00:54:17.550 --> 00:54:21.080
Collapse is do make a prediction.
They,
they,
they,

911
00:54:21.081 --> 00:54:24.570
they predict where the quantum classical divide lies.

912
00:54:25.380 --> 00:54:30.380
So the collapse series basically point out that if the mass of the system that

913
00:54:30.871 --> 00:54:33.540
you're looking at gets beyond a certain point,

914
00:54:33.690 --> 00:54:36.270
it will spontaneously collapse within a certain timeframe.

915
00:54:37.140 --> 00:54:40.530
And so now you can imagine doing the double slit experiment with larger and

916
00:54:40.531 --> 00:54:44.790
larger entities.
So starting with electrons,

917
00:54:44.791 --> 00:54:46.080
you can then go to atoms,

918
00:54:46.081 --> 00:54:50.010
molecules to see if you get the interference pattern right.

919
00:54:50.520 --> 00:54:53.250
And the moment the interference pattern disappears,

920
00:54:53.310 --> 00:54:57.870
it means that the quantum object that you're sending through the double slit has

921
00:54:57.871 --> 00:55:01.350
collapsed to in such a way that is only going through one or the other.

922
00:55:01.410 --> 00:55:05.070
And it's not interfering anymore.
So those experiments are being done.

923
00:55:05.100 --> 00:55:08.760
They have actually managed to send see 60 molecules,

924
00:55:08.761 --> 00:55:12.430
60 carbon atoms through this double slit.
He didn't a few years.

925
00:55:12.450 --> 00:55:17.430
The largest a molecule that has been sent so far through a double slit has I

926
00:55:17.431 --> 00:55:20.370
think 800 items or 10,000 atomic mass units.

927
00:55:20.400 --> 00:55:24.300
These are massive molecules and they will go to the double slit and interfere.

928
00:55:24.301 --> 00:55:25.890
They behave as if they were going through both.

929
00:55:26.310 --> 00:55:29.640
So the quantum classical boundary has not yet been seen,

930
00:55:30.450 --> 00:55:35.450
but collapse series do make predictions that are not quite within reach of

931
00:55:35.491 --> 00:55:37.560
experiments,
but maybe another five,
10 years.

<v 1>Thank you.</v>

933
00:55:42.900 --> 00:55:47.130
<v 0>We should take further questions after giving people a chance to leave.</v>

934
00:55:47.190 --> 00:55:51.240
There are copies of the book available if you would like to pick one up on the

935
00:55:51.241 --> 00:55:52.074
way out.

936
00:55:53.820 --> 00:55:55.650
<v 2>No,
thank you very much.
Thank you.</v>
