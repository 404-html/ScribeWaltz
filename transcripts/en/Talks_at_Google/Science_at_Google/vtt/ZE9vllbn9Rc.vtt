00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.060
Hi everyone.
Welcome to told her cubicle.

2
00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.010
I'm delighted to introduce today's speaker.
Doctor,
how are you Barry?

3
00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:20.170
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

4
00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:22.490
<v 1>hey,
did everybody,
um,</v>

5
00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:25.960
great turnout and hopefully now you get something out of this today.

6
00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:29.230
Why don't I go to talk about today is the difference between the anxiety and

7
00:00:29.231 --> 00:00:32.230
panic and wine.
Does anxieties become a problem in our lives?

8
00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:34.450
A modern view of anxiety and panic?

9
00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:39.070
The role of our stress system or a logic and emotion brands.
Uh,

10
00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:41.290
key players and anxiety and panic.

11
00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.250
And then we're going to go straight into what a panic attacks.

12
00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.750
How'd you deal with him?
Hoss?
General anxiety.
How to deal with it.

13
00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.730
What social anxiety.
How to deal with phobias.
That's a prayer of it,

14
00:00:51.731 --> 00:00:55.690
isn't it?
I'm going to move,
I gotta move along at speed.
Is that okay?

15
00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:58.900
So here's the question for everybody present.

16
00:00:58.901 --> 00:01:00.400
How many of you suffer from anxiety?

17
00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:04.950
You are a very good growth because at least a few.

18
00:01:04.951 --> 00:01:09.220
You were brave enough to put up your hands.
Okay,
here's the test for everybody.

19
00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.000
Yep.
Sorry.
Eh,
here's,
I did a test for everybody.

20
00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.620
I want you to close your eyes and for 30 seconds take of the most embarrassing

21
00:01:17.621 --> 00:01:21.010
thing that ever happened to you,
the most shameful,
the most off.

22
00:01:21.011 --> 00:01:24.490
The thing you don't want anybody else in the room to note is that,
okay,

23
00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.860
why don't you pick this?
I ain't going to walk up and down

24
00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:32.740
and I'm going to ask you.

25
00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:35.470
You've got to pick somebody out and you're going to have to stand up.

26
00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:38.410
Is that okay?
You're going to have to tell everybody in the audience.

27
00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:41.080
That's most embarrassing thing.
Is that okay?
We always had,

28
00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:46.060
this is always wonderful because people aren't tying to look away or look up,

29
00:01:46.061 --> 00:01:50.110
look down because everybody is going to feel ashamed and embarrassed.

30
00:01:50.111 --> 00:01:52.360
Isn't that right?
Okay,

31
00:01:52.361 --> 00:01:55.170
so I'm going to pick somebody I think from over here we're like,
well,

32
00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.840
maybe I'll go over here
anyway.
Good year.
As far as,

33
00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.710
I'm not going to ask you a tour today,
the most embarrassing thing in your life,

34
00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:08.140
but hands up.
Anybody who taught who got anxious that I might come on.

35
00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:14.050
Okay.
No,
I think that's very important because we all get anxious,
don't fee.

36
00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:17.330
And the first big message of today is that anxiety as normal.

37
00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.380
But how did you feel physically?
Did you all feel,

38
00:02:20.381 --> 00:02:23.920
notice your heart going back quicker,
stomach more or better?
Not God,

39
00:02:23.921 --> 00:02:24.850
I hope it doesn't take me.

40
00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:27.940
The reason for that is because as human beings we hit to be embarrassed,

41
00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.870
but that's how you feel when you're anxious.

42
00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:36.010
So I think it's important that anxiety is a normal human emotion that relates to

43
00:02:36.011 --> 00:02:38.260
very much worrying about what's going to happen in the future.

44
00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:39.550
Whilst I going to ask her,

45
00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:44.290
fear is very much about the acute sense of the here and no sense of dread in

46
00:02:44.291 --> 00:02:46.990
here and know somebody of you were probably panicking a little bit there,

47
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.270
then I might ask you.
But I think,
well,

48
00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:52.960
both of these emotions are quite healthy and appropriate.
For example,

49
00:02:52.961 --> 00:02:56.190
if I'm afraid I'm gonna lose my job,
I'm going to be doing a lot of worrying.

50
00:02:56.191 --> 00:02:59.800
So I'm going to be very anxious.
If I meet a mugger,
I'm going be very panicky.

51
00:02:59.801 --> 00:03:00.910
So I'm going to be very fearful.

52
00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:06.270
So I think these become a problem in our lives though.
The plan to become co,

53
00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:09.570
you know,
really chronic and pervasive,
uh,
and fun.

54
00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:13.930
There's no real danger and they're often accompanied by this serious of physical

55
00:03:13.931 --> 00:03:14.381
symptoms.

56
00:03:14.381 --> 00:03:18.370
And if there's one big message I want to get across today is the physical nature

57
00:03:18.371 --> 00:03:22.900
of anxiety and they think what's important was when we get anxious is we all try

58
00:03:22.901 --> 00:03:27.901
to avoid like you've all looked away and that was your natural instinct because

59
00:03:28.211 --> 00:03:32.060
you didn't want to be picked on.
So our natural behavior is safety,

60
00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:35.410
behavior avoidance behavior,
and they take,
in modern Ireland,

61
00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:39.700
we're seeing the huge increase in boarding zygosity and panic and a game changer

62
00:03:39.701 --> 00:03:40.660
for result,
to be honest,

63
00:03:40.661 --> 00:03:45.490
has been the smart phone and social media that has massively increased the

64
00:03:45.491 --> 00:03:49.570
national sense of anxiety and panic.
And I think it's not,

65
00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:53.200
it's not unfair to say that we're all living and some of us unfortunately are

66
00:03:53.201 --> 00:03:56.680
dying in the world of continuous rating,

67
00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:59.320
which goes on as a result of social media.

68
00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:05.820
I think the modern approach to understanding anxiety and panic is that all of

69
00:04:06.881 --> 00:04:10.000
us,
through a combination of genes,
upbringings,

70
00:04:10.001 --> 00:04:12.730
and general life occurrences end up with becoming,

71
00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:14.830
having these pathways in our brain,

72
00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:18.940
which become fairly fixed as we're growing and developing and our mind and our

73
00:04:18.941 --> 00:04:21.640
brand partners get interwoven each feeding on the other.

74
00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:24.180
As we'll see later,

75
00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:28.420
therapy's all about trying to change those pathways and we call this capacity of

76
00:04:28.421 --> 00:04:31.990
the brain to change neuroplasticity,
the ability to change.

77
00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:37.180
So what's quite extraordinary is the capacity of each person here to change your

78
00:04:37.181 --> 00:04:41.680
brain pathways to positive ones.
And the mind itself,

79
00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:42.543
believe it or not,

80
00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:46.960
is the generator that we use to change those patterns.

81
00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:51.820
So this really opens up the very exciting possibility that we can use our mind

82
00:04:51.821 --> 00:04:56.150
to reshape the very brand pathways which are causing the problems for us in.

83
00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:59.200
So we're no longer slaves of the past,

84
00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:02.800
but we can learn how to modify these brain pathways,

85
00:05:02.801 --> 00:05:05.830
which caused so much difficulties with panic attacks,
general anxiety,

86
00:05:05.831 --> 00:05:09.310
social anxiety and phobias.
And this is best done with CVT.

87
00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:14.470
Would you like to do a first bit of neuroscience?
Okay.

88
00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:17.290
This is for neuroscience with for dummies.
Is that okay?

89
00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:19.000
We're going to do it in a cup to seconds.

90
00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:22.670
So we're going to do a bit of quick neuroscience or mood.

91
00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:27.250
A mood system in the brain is basically control composed of four parts.

92
00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:31.420
The frontal we'll fee component of which is our prefrontal cortex or our logical

93
00:05:31.421 --> 00:05:33.410
brain or limbic mood department,

94
00:05:33.411 --> 00:05:37.270
which is our emotional brain or adrenal stress land and Duka Cortisol,

95
00:05:37.271 --> 00:05:41.590
our stress hormone,
which all make up the word flag.
So believe it or not,

96
00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:45.810
that's what your brand looks like.
Pretty,
pretty.
Pretty York isn't just,
uh,

97
00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:49.180
but at the front of your brain is about a tardy or brand is called the

98
00:05:49.181 --> 00:05:52.720
prefrontal cortex.
And there's some key areas here.

99
00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:57.660
The logic box is what you use a lot here in Google,
a lot of rationality,
uh,

100
00:05:57.670 --> 00:06:01.220
and also,
uh,
attention bucks as the party is.

101
00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:03.740
And today when you're looking at me,
um,

102
00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:07.190
the emotional control box and social control boxes is very much about how we

103
00:06:07.191 --> 00:06:10.790
manage our emotions and control our social behavior.

104
00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:14.480
But our prefrontal Cortex,
our logical brain,

105
00:06:14.481 --> 00:06:18.380
just think of it as your logical brain.
It's in charge of reasoning,
logic,

106
00:06:18.381 --> 00:06:21.570
analysis,
planning and creativity.
It's how we can treat,

107
00:06:21.571 --> 00:06:25.490
create and control and mood is very important in how he controlled behavior,

108
00:06:25.491 --> 00:06:29.180
particularly impulsive self destructive behaviors such as self harm or suicide

109
00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:32.230
and very,
very important in how we uh,

110
00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:35.630
we live in our social world and very important for empathy.

111
00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:38.750
That's what your emotion,

112
00:06:38.751 --> 00:06:41.240
that's what your emotional brain looks like is called your limbic system.

113
00:06:41.241 --> 00:06:42.740
It's in the middle of your brain,

114
00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:47.480
a very old part of the brand and as you can see there are a couple of key areas

115
00:06:47.481 --> 00:06:47.840
there.

116
00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:52.700
The memory box is called your hippocampus dust where you actually organize all

117
00:06:52.701 --> 00:06:56.810
your memories.
The islands and area called the insula distress box.

118
00:06:56.811 --> 00:06:57.920
We'd be talking a lot about today.

119
00:06:57.921 --> 00:07:02.240
It's called the Amygdala and the pleasure box is called the nucleus accumbens.

120
00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:07.070
But basically your emotional brain is controlling your stress system is how we

121
00:07:07.071 --> 00:07:11.180
process our emotions.
Negative emotions like fear,
sadness,
anger,

122
00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:15.620
how we store it and retrieve memories and how we enjoy food,

123
00:07:15.621 --> 00:07:20.180
sex and alcohol or this is the really the more important part of the slide,

124
00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:24.650
which is the bigger arrow.
It's the one going for our emotion.

125
00:07:24.651 --> 00:07:26.330
Brand is a to our logical brain,

126
00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:30.640
and this is really important because for years it was taught that are irrational

127
00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:33.650
brain or logical brain,
our prefrontal cortex as much more powerful,

128
00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:37.550
but we now realize there's far more connections going from emotional brain to

129
00:07:37.551 --> 00:07:40.640
our logical brain and in reverse.
Now,
this is critical for mental health.

130
00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:42.830
I would probably say after it was a single slide,

131
00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:47.000
I was asked to shoulder to actually explain mental health.
This is it.

132
00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:51.710
That one slide there,
very simple slide,
but actually that's the key.

133
00:07:51.711 --> 00:07:55.340
That very simple slide there because when we're well,

134
00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:58.940
our emotions and our logic are in harmony.
For example,

135
00:07:59.390 --> 00:08:04.390
a promo going by our favorite Chinese restaurant or Italian restaurant,

136
00:08:05.331 --> 00:08:09.140
and we're three or four stone of weight and are a rational brand,

137
00:08:09.141 --> 00:08:10.220
says for God's sake,

138
00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:14.270
we not going to here you'd have to die more richer emotional brand smells the

139
00:08:14.271 --> 00:08:19.271
food which wins of course your emotional wreck or it's three in the morning and

140
00:08:19.371 --> 00:08:23.380
you're referred your girlfriend or your boyfriend flogging ran,
freeze and cold,

141
00:08:23.390 --> 00:08:24.410
and your rational brain says,

142
00:08:24.411 --> 00:08:26.540
for God's sake when you get out of here for getting pneumonia,

143
00:08:26.930 --> 00:08:31.250
but your emotional brain would say Lemoore.
Okay,
I hope

144
00:08:34.110 --> 00:08:34.943
we'd be worried.

145
00:08:35.420 --> 00:08:38.660
So I think what's really important is that every decision we make during the day

146
00:08:38.661 --> 00:08:42.140
is a k in the dance of life is a kind of a combination of emotion and logic.

147
00:08:42.590 --> 00:08:46.460
But when we unfortunately get into difficulties with anxiety,
depression,

148
00:08:47.450 --> 00:08:48.283
self harm,

149
00:08:48.770 --> 00:08:53.210
what actually happened is that our emotional brain turns negative on us and when

150
00:08:53.211 --> 00:08:55.230
it turns negative,
it's swamps her logical brand.

151
00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:56.730
And that's when all the fun begins.

152
00:08:57.990 --> 00:09:00.600
So very quickly we're going to have a look at the stress system.

153
00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:05.700
Very important distress system is critical for anxiety and the stress system's

154
00:09:05.701 --> 00:09:07.410
job is to look for danger,

155
00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:12.570
any kind of immediate danger or perceived trash and basically pick up on that

156
00:09:12.571 --> 00:09:17.571
danger and physically prepare the body to fire to get ready for that danger.

157
00:09:18.150 --> 00:09:21.900
And it's crazy can function is to protect us and not harmless.

158
00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:24.360
And if you can understand this simple idea,

159
00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:26.760
we don't understand almost everything to do with anxiety.

160
00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:31.890
This is a very simple slide for it simply shows distress boxes of literary

161
00:09:31.891 --> 00:09:35.060
called the Mega,
which we'll be talking about in a minute.
Uh,

162
00:09:35.310 --> 00:09:39.300
basically supposed to be calm under acute stress.
I your boss's college,

163
00:09:39.330 --> 00:09:42.450
you mentioned you're not sure what the hell they've done wrong and suddenly you

164
00:09:42.451 --> 00:09:44.640
find that you're pumping out adrenaline.

165
00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:47.530
Noradrenaline would be if you're going to get aggressive with them,

166
00:09:47.531 --> 00:09:51.210
which is very unlikely,
Adrenalin is going to be,
uh,
if you're,

167
00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:55.650
if you're feeling a bit fearful about the interview and what happens is

168
00:09:55.651 --> 00:09:58.380
adrenaline needs our fear of harm when we talk about that in a minute.

169
00:09:58.710 --> 00:10:02.640
But so both were under some chronic or persistent stress.
Well.
Then we start,

170
00:10:02.641 --> 00:10:05.090
which is a chronic stress home,
which is took a cortisol.

171
00:10:05.490 --> 00:10:08.490
And this is the guide that leads to so many difficulties in our lives.

172
00:10:10.050 --> 00:10:13.010
So I'm going to talk about these and foster distress system.

173
00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:15.870
It's called the Amygdala.
And this is an order,

174
00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:18.470
this is a great friend of mine because uh,
uh,

175
00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:21.930
I had a great conversation verbatim and great discussions with people about him.

176
00:10:22.370 --> 00:10:25.950
Now it's a very ancient Oregon buried in your emotional brand and it's hard to

177
00:10:25.951 --> 00:10:28.350
believe that this guy was round in Italian,
the dinosaur.

178
00:10:28.830 --> 00:10:32.580
So before man came into being at all the Amygdala,
it was firing.

179
00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:38.160
So it senses danger,
it fires,
and it activates the rest of your stress system.

180
00:10:38.550 --> 00:10:39.680
And it activates that.

181
00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:44.720
It releases adrenaline and mainly so adrenaline is our fear.

182
00:10:44.731 --> 00:10:48.150
Harmon.
So I think you'll find from,
we go to panic attacks,
how important this is.

183
00:10:48.690 --> 00:10:53.130
So our fear hormones very much involved in a,
I'm going to give you a,
a story.

184
00:10:53.131 --> 00:10:54.570
When I was in Africa matter leopard,

185
00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:59.370
and I'm not joking at three in the morning there,
they didn't believe you.

186
00:10:59.371 --> 00:11:02.490
But the shot from the following day.
So when I met the leopard,

187
00:11:02.491 --> 00:11:07.440
what saved my life was the Amygdala there,
saw the leopard before I did.
I froze.

188
00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:12.390
And suddenly my heart is pounding.
I was shaking,
I was sweating,
I couldn't breed,

189
00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:17.490
uh,
at my musters role tense.
My mouth was dry and a disturbed sense of dread.

190
00:11:18.270 --> 00:11:22.080
In fact,
what do make it Lou was doing was getting me ready to do a runner.

191
00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:25.440
So if my heart went faster,
I would run quicker.

192
00:11:25.441 --> 00:11:29.070
If my stomach was in knots and the blood was taken notes and send to my muscles,

193
00:11:29.071 --> 00:11:30.660
they'd run faster and motorists,

194
00:11:30.661 --> 00:11:34.380
dre or the bloods or subtotal in Bozeman central and muscles and run faster.

195
00:11:34.710 --> 00:11:38.340
And we can all identify with those symptoms when we get acutely stressed.

196
00:11:38.790 --> 00:11:42.870
But if the dangerous end scene is more chronic,
uh,
we ended up succeeding more,

197
00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:46.380
of course,
which is our retirement,
where it hormone,
which we'll talk about it.

198
00:11:46.890 --> 00:11:50.940
So there's some lovely facts about the Amygdala and you'll see why these are

199
00:11:50.941 --> 00:11:52.050
very important.
They wrong.

200
00:11:52.380 --> 00:11:56.350
First thing about is I call them the gunslinger because he's trend from the time

201
00:11:56.351 --> 00:12:00.370
of the day and is hard to draw and fire instantly.
So He's razor sharp.

202
00:12:00.620 --> 00:12:03.490
He's a gunslinger second that he's ticket the wall.

203
00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:07.450
And actually once you understand that if you make tick as the wall,

204
00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:11.140
you can get rid of panic attacks very quickly.
Once you get it,

205
00:12:11.141 --> 00:12:13.830
you understand this guys take it away.
I didn't get rid of a lot of phobias,

206
00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:18.130
so I think he doesn't do talk to her,
but he's not particularly interested.

207
00:12:18.131 --> 00:12:19.090
You can't have a chart for him.

208
00:12:19.091 --> 00:12:21.010
He didn't have a chat with me when I'm at a leopard and say,

209
00:12:21.011 --> 00:12:21.970
what do you think we should do?

210
00:12:22.390 --> 00:12:27.310
He just fired his along memory for fear or danger.
That's the big problem.

211
00:12:27.550 --> 00:12:28.900
Once he remembers the danger,

212
00:12:28.901 --> 00:12:31.990
he'd remember it the next time and the next times it gets stronger and stronger.

213
00:12:32.650 --> 00:12:36.490
He's also counterintuitive in that you can't listen.
You can't talk to them.

214
00:12:36.491 --> 00:12:38.140
Do using all of northern techniques.

215
00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.010
So just to finish with the neuroscience,

216
00:12:42.011 --> 00:12:47.011
but our prefrontal cortex is very important in this regulates our stress system

217
00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:50.590
and really important that when we're anxious,

218
00:12:50.950 --> 00:12:52.780
the rate side of our brain,

219
00:12:52.870 --> 00:12:56.020
the prefrontal cortex is where we catastrophize what's going to happen.

220
00:12:56.410 --> 00:12:57.880
And the left side is the warrior.

221
00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:02.470
And really important is that the right side has a straight link to the

222
00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:05.200
gunslinger.
So the more we could testify about something,

223
00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:09.070
the more we've immortal fires.
So let's,

224
00:13:09.071 --> 00:13:11.830
let's go on a dare the key players and anxiety,

225
00:13:11.831 --> 00:13:15.730
then the Amygdala in the center.
When you're acutely anxious,

226
00:13:15.731 --> 00:13:19.060
you'd treats the adrenaline as release Adrenalin when you're chronically
anxious,

227
00:13:19.061 --> 00:13:21.910
who released the took of course.
So when you're worrying all the time,

228
00:13:22.060 --> 00:13:24.920
you're using the left side of your brand and when you're catastrophizing,

229
00:13:24.950 --> 00:13:26.240
you're using the right side of the brain.

230
00:13:27.430 --> 00:13:31.570
So these are the anxiety disorders that we're going to deal with very quickly.

231
00:13:31.660 --> 00:13:35.530
Panic attacks for his social anxiety and a bit of general anxiety.

232
00:13:36.430 --> 00:13:40.890
So imagine John Sitting at home reading the paper when he suddenly feels his

233
00:13:40.900 --> 00:13:45.010
horse pony shaking.
Sweating is breathing faster,

234
00:13:45.370 --> 00:13:46.031
is terrible.

235
00:13:46.031 --> 00:13:50.640
Things that dread his weakness is truck closing in and he thinks it's all over.

236
00:13:51.370 --> 00:13:54.580
It's never happened to him before and he served is going today.

237
00:13:55.330 --> 00:13:59.860
So welcome John to the word of panic attacks.
And this is really,
really come.

238
00:14:00.420 --> 00:14:02.890
I had one man,
he was actually watching a cartoon show.

239
00:14:03.310 --> 00:14:06.640
He would laugh in a way and two minutes later even the middle of a panic attack

240
00:14:06.790 --> 00:14:11.020
full blown.
So these are very common,

241
00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:14.260
up to 8% of the population will have at least one in their lifetime,

242
00:14:14.290 --> 00:14:17.140
but 5% of the population would have recurrent homes.

243
00:14:17.830 --> 00:14:21.760
I think what's important that they can be associated with general anxiety,

244
00:14:21.761 --> 00:14:24.270
depression and addiction,
but frequently occur in the role.

245
00:14:24.970 --> 00:14:28.300
They can occur in any situation at any time.
And that's what the problem lies.

246
00:14:28.750 --> 00:14:31.750
So the fear of getting them,
which we call panic disorder,

247
00:14:31.990 --> 00:14:34.030
is actually the biggest single problem.

248
00:14:34.210 --> 00:14:37.750
So we not only have to worry about the panic attack,
but we worry about will.

249
00:14:37.751 --> 00:14:41.440
I would have happened in front of my workmates when it happened,
when emotional,

250
00:14:41.470 --> 00:14:43.450
the party would,
it happened in front of my friends.

251
00:14:43.451 --> 00:14:47.230
But it happened in the shopping center.
So people begin to dread these symptoms.

252
00:14:48.190 --> 00:14:51.380
So these are typically kind of symptoms which you've already gone through,

253
00:14:51.650 --> 00:14:54.080
but a really important point that far the person,

254
00:14:54.110 --> 00:14:57.530
there's no obvious trigger so they can see what started to panic attack.

255
00:14:57.830 --> 00:15:02.450
The guy was watching a comedy,
some cartoons,
so what and Garth name triggered it.

256
00:15:04.130 --> 00:15:08.390
But the good news is that they're actually caused by the gunslinger firing back

257
00:15:08.391 --> 00:15:11.450
to my friend.
You make to it because it senses a danger,

258
00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:16.880
releases adrenaline from the adrenal gland which pours into your,
into your body,

259
00:15:16.881 --> 00:15:21.380
giving you all of these extreme,
the horrible,
comfortable physical symptoms.

260
00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:22.610
So they,

261
00:15:22.610 --> 00:15:27.290
the secret really is that the trigger is the first physical symptom that we feel

262
00:15:28.430 --> 00:15:32.270
and what happens then is our catastrophizing mine stars and maybe individualize

263
00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:33.860
it as something terrible is going to happen.

264
00:15:34.550 --> 00:15:38.720
And the things that people most often,
it's unbelievably how constant is it?

265
00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.130
Because I have dealt with,
I would here to tell you,

266
00:15:41.131 --> 00:15:44.090
you know how many people have dealt with and these days they will always come

267
00:15:44.091 --> 00:15:46.550
back to these dangers.
Here,
I'm going to have a heart attack,

268
00:15:46.551 --> 00:15:48.970
stroke collapse or day and go to,

269
00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:53.870
I'm going to completely lose control and run amok and going to call mad or

270
00:15:53.871 --> 00:15:57.860
people who seen me.
So these are the dangers that the person has.

271
00:15:58.190 --> 00:16:02.500
So they interpret their for these initial symptoms as dangerous demand their

272
00:16:02.501 --> 00:16:05.660
stuff.
And of course the more that you demand this stuff,
the worst to get.

273
00:16:06.290 --> 00:16:09.560
And then port causes all the trouble is our safety behavior because what do

274
00:16:09.561 --> 00:16:13.580
people do at panic attack to head off to the [inaudible],
to leave the area,

275
00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:17.480
to take tranquilizers,
to try breathing exercises there,
trade,

276
00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:19.730
most of all to stop the physical symptoms.

277
00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:22.790
And of course the board are used and the more they trade his behavior,

278
00:16:22.910 --> 00:16:27.290
the worse it gets.
So I think what's causing it,

279
00:16:27.291 --> 00:16:31.820
what's really important is that the physical symptoms of anxiety that you

280
00:16:31.821 --> 00:16:34.940
experienced during a panic attack or uncomfortable but not dangerous,

281
00:16:35.090 --> 00:16:40.040
that's the key to them to are best treated with CBT.
A one,

282
00:16:40.090 --> 00:16:44.270
a request to have his daughter's tranquilizers because if he was tranquilized

283
00:16:44.271 --> 00:16:44.691
your stuff,

284
00:16:44.691 --> 00:16:48.700
do you Megla from changing its memory does a much simpler way to get rid of the

285
00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:49.070
void.

286
00:16:49.070 --> 00:16:52.460
Antidepressants cause people are proud of 90 presses all the time for this and

287
00:16:52.461 --> 00:16:54.540
as a total waste of time,
uh,

288
00:16:55.850 --> 00:16:59.210
never try and stop a panic attack.
That's what everybody goes wrong.

289
00:16:59.540 --> 00:17:03.800
They tried to stop the attack and the visualization I give to people is imagine

290
00:17:03.801 --> 00:17:06.290
you could go into the sea,
put up your hand and try and stop to tight.

291
00:17:06.890 --> 00:17:10.550
That's what it's like to trap botanic tag because when you get to when the

292
00:17:10.580 --> 00:17:13.970
gunslinger fires and adrenaline rush is going to happen with the election or
not.

293
00:17:14.780 --> 00:17:17.630
So we known all that.
If you do nothing in the past,
in 10 minutes,

294
00:17:17.631 --> 00:17:19.370
if he tracks stuff,
it'll take up to an hour.

295
00:17:21.170 --> 00:17:26.060
So the modern neuroscience has shown us that if we use a concept called flooding

296
00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:31.670
that had actually clears and flooding as this extraordinary concept where we

297
00:17:31.671 --> 00:17:35.340
actually visually get the person to visualize that are stuck to the chair at the

298
00:17:35.341 --> 00:17:37.700
CAC,
go into Europe.
And a panic attack strokes.

299
00:17:37.970 --> 00:17:42.230
They're not allowed to do anything but to have to visualize that the panic

300
00:17:42.231 --> 00:17:46.340
attack weaves these horrible physical symptoms flood over them.

301
00:17:47.780 --> 00:17:50.100
And actually what happened is,
but they don't try to stop them.

302
00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:54.390
And what happens is the gunslinger changes as memory at that moment in time.

303
00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:57.930
One stick guns thing,
a realizes that you're not as saying your danger,

304
00:17:58.580 --> 00:17:59.520
he actually changes.

305
00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:03.420
And actually from Dan on the next time it happens as much lesser and the

306
00:18:03.421 --> 00:18:04.680
negative ended after that.
Scott.

307
00:18:05.850 --> 00:18:09.330
So what we actually do is we get people to understand that these symptoms are

308
00:18:09.331 --> 00:18:13.320
not dangerous.
There are simply a normal bodily adrenaline rush.

309
00:18:13.660 --> 00:18:15.120
There are uncomfortable about Dante.

310
00:18:15.140 --> 00:18:18.510
And so you give the person the choice of fears and to discomforted using

311
00:18:18.511 --> 00:18:21.120
flooding or running from panic attacks for the rest of your life.

312
00:18:21.590 --> 00:18:24.090
And this is so successful that we would hear,

313
00:18:24.330 --> 00:18:28.240
I'd say 95% of panic attacks in one session,
maybe Max two sections.

314
00:18:28.540 --> 00:18:32.420
And that's something that's not,
that's not an age of step.
And no,

315
00:18:32.450 --> 00:18:33.690
we are genuinely cleared.

316
00:18:33.990 --> 00:18:38.100
We've had people with panic attacks up to 30 years and cheered them and maybe

317
00:18:38.101 --> 00:18:42.270
one or two sessions.
Okay.
Happy with that.

318
00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:47.850
General anxiety,
uh,
is where we get,
these are where people,

319
00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:53.240
mainly women are more warriors and they've constant in bursts of intense anxiety

320
00:18:54.031 --> 00:18:55.140
and worry about health,

321
00:18:55.141 --> 00:18:58.890
family jobs and the key to us that you have a constant sense for board and

322
00:18:58.891 --> 00:19:02.820
they're both some impending disaster,
your daughter,
what the hell it is but it,

323
00:19:02.830 --> 00:19:06.600
but it's there all the time and just constant catastrophizing for what might

324
00:19:06.601 --> 00:19:10.090
happen.
And the Tinder causes the real problem or role the,

325
00:19:10.430 --> 00:19:14.010
the physical symptoms because you get mental and physical symptoms.

326
00:19:14.330 --> 00:19:17.400
You've got things like urge of above.
These are kind of constant ones.

327
00:19:17.401 --> 00:19:20.670
Pro Concentration and memory,
sleep difficulties,

328
00:19:20.671 --> 00:19:25.080
nightmares in decisiveness,
difficulty coping,
uh,

329
00:19:25.290 --> 00:19:28.500
avoiding everyday task because you want to have them done perfectly.

330
00:19:28.770 --> 00:19:32.280
Muscle tension,
teak ranging.
Uh,
very funny,

331
00:19:32.281 --> 00:19:37.281
I deleted her recently and I was going through the thing of the symptoms about

332
00:19:37.891 --> 00:19:40.050
any teeth grinding and she started to laugh because she had,

333
00:19:40.140 --> 00:19:44.340
she had the garden place from the dentist.
So really common,

334
00:19:44.910 --> 00:19:48.950
uh,
and increase risk of panic attacks.
And I think,
uh,

335
00:19:49.050 --> 00:19:50.940
I think what's important is about two or three,

336
00:19:51.030 --> 00:19:53.310
we'll have at least one episode of depression and are like,

337
00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:56.550
but what's really important for women,
this matters for women particularly,

338
00:19:56.910 --> 00:19:57.541
is that many,

339
00:19:57.541 --> 00:20:01.410
many people use alcohol to try and corporate us because the order you get,

340
00:20:01.530 --> 00:20:05.400
the worse it gets.
And if you don't deal with it properly,

341
00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:09.210
you started to use things like garlic and lots of women news way.

342
00:20:09.590 --> 00:20:14.100
I'd say the number one treatment for general anxiety monster,
which is why,

343
00:20:14.340 --> 00:20:17.670
and therefore lots of women become increasingly hooked on wine.

344
00:20:18.090 --> 00:20:20.670
So it's a really important to stay.
In the old days,

345
00:20:20.671 --> 00:20:22.410
lots of people got hooked on tranquilizers.

346
00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:24.240
Thankfully that's not as much any longer.

347
00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:27.330
And they think it's important that we get,

348
00:20:27.331 --> 00:20:31.980
we get anxious because of these genetic and earned very much environmental

349
00:20:32.610 --> 00:20:35.820
partners that are set down,
uh,
when we're growing and developing.

350
00:20:37.780 --> 00:20:41.360
And I think the key physical thing in the in,

351
00:20:41.361 --> 00:20:45.180
in general anxiety is that the right side of your brain and his catastrophizing

352
00:20:45.181 --> 00:20:48.970
and the left side is worry and Baltar into a lot of cortisol being released.

353
00:20:48.971 --> 00:20:49.920
Took a course on Duke.

354
00:20:49.921 --> 00:20:54.370
A car is the guy just giving you the tired but wired feeling the teeth grinding

355
00:20:54.371 --> 00:20:56.020
and all of these physical symptoms at night.

356
00:20:58.180 --> 00:21:02.130
I did treatment is holistic exercise,
nutrition,
Yoga,
Oliver,
Oliver,

357
00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:06.130
all of a role,
I think CBT is really good.
Trey,

358
00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:09.580
if you can't avoid use of antidepressants because in general they're not

359
00:21:09.581 --> 00:21:14.380
necessary and the vast majority of cases they actually really worse than the

360
00:21:14.381 --> 00:21:18.910
issue.
CBT.
I do it at the end.

361
00:21:19.030 --> 00:21:23.170
Is that a CBT?
CBT,
cognitive behavior therapy.
Okay.

362
00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:27.130
I give you an exact believe or not.
When I went through the panic attacks,

363
00:21:27.131 --> 00:21:30.670
which are,
I was actually giving you a cognitive behavioral therapy exercises.

364
00:21:30.950 --> 00:21:34.120
I'm not interesting.
You've already had some.
Okay.

365
00:21:36.430 --> 00:21:39.010
Okay,
so what are we doing in CBT,

366
00:21:39.011 --> 00:21:43.840
which is that we try to reshape the person's tinkering under behavior.
So,

367
00:21:43.841 --> 00:21:48.760
in other words,
the thinking behind general anxiety is a demand for control.

368
00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:52.840
So if there's one word that describes general anxiety is the person who wants to

369
00:21:52.841 --> 00:21:56.650
be in control.
The person who wants to get everything done perfectly,
everything,

370
00:21:56.651 --> 00:21:59.890
all of us on time,
one to control every facet of their life.

371
00:22:00.250 --> 00:22:04.540
So while we had to do is challenge that whole demand for control and they also

372
00:22:04.541 --> 00:22:07.210
have a great tendency to catastrophize.
So we have to teach them skills,

373
00:22:07.211 --> 00:22:08.044
how to do that.

374
00:22:08.500 --> 00:22:12.040
But particularly we have to go after it or behavior because a lot of people end

375
00:22:12.041 --> 00:22:13.750
up spending avoidant behavior.

376
00:22:13.870 --> 00:22:17.830
So the typical example would be you have a job to do and you want it done

377
00:22:17.831 --> 00:22:20.860
perfectly and you're so anxious about doing it that you keep delaying putting it

378
00:22:20.861 --> 00:22:24.100
off and then it gets closer and closer to the time and has to get done.

379
00:22:24.190 --> 00:22:25.690
But you're getting more and more anxious.

380
00:22:25.810 --> 00:22:29.800
So actually it ends up and you incredibly anxious doing it at the last minute,

381
00:22:30.220 --> 00:22:33.910
uh,
and,
and feeling more anxious then this,
you haven't done a property.

382
00:22:34.090 --> 00:22:35.410
So it kind of builds on itself.

383
00:22:36.110 --> 00:22:38.470
I always use the example of where I get into trouble with the girls.

384
00:22:38.471 --> 00:22:42.940
Can I do this of imagining having the [inaudible] branch or maybe I'll do it,

385
00:22:43.040 --> 00:22:45.410
maybe I'll do it tomorrow and then tomorrow comes along and says,

386
00:22:45.460 --> 00:22:48.460
maybe I limited it to tomorrow and suddenly you have a pile of our own and go on

387
00:22:48.461 --> 00:22:51.070
and you wonder how in Gallon home hell am I ever going to start and stuff.

388
00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:54.550
So you know it.
That's just the kind of world live person,
maternal anxiety,

389
00:22:55.570 --> 00:22:59.770
social anxiety is another common,
really disabling the condition.

390
00:23:00.100 --> 00:23:04.330
This is for a person suffers from constant social anxiety in social situations

391
00:23:04.710 --> 00:23:06.310
there for a period of greater than six months.

392
00:23:06.550 --> 00:23:08.320
The secret here is that her experience,

393
00:23:08.321 --> 00:23:13.030
a sense of being judged and being judged harshly by yachters and feeling

394
00:23:13.031 --> 00:23:15.940
embarrassed by their own actions and social situations.

395
00:23:17.470 --> 00:23:20.260
And I think what's important that they're are also accompanied by a lot of

396
00:23:20.261 --> 00:23:23.980
physical symptoms like blushing,
sweating your mind,
going blank,

397
00:23:23.981 --> 00:23:27.730
stammering and unlike ball sort of phobias,

398
00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:31.450
continuous exposure to people doesn't make it any better.

399
00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:34.840
And they think the critical thing is that most people end up avoiding social

400
00:23:34.841 --> 00:23:38.950
situations.
And I,
I've had lots of young people who for example,

401
00:23:38.951 --> 00:23:41.560
is struggling to go into relationships and the reason they're struggling with,

402
00:23:41.570 --> 00:23:44.530
into relationships because when they go into a social situation and are so

403
00:23:44.620 --> 00:23:47.330
anxious and so embarrassed that they don't know what to do.

404
00:23:47.900 --> 00:23:51.350
The lovely thing is that within four or five sessions we can get people back to

405
00:23:51.351 --> 00:23:52.820
normal tobacco socialize.

406
00:23:53.390 --> 00:23:57.410
My Day was made one day when this lovely young man had done about four sessions

407
00:23:58.000 --> 00:23:59.270
and he came in and shook my hand and he said,

408
00:23:59.450 --> 00:24:03.230
cause he had struggled even to even to talk to a girl.
He said,

409
00:24:03.260 --> 00:24:08.150
I know and I have a debt.
Good.
I said we had done it.
Okay.

410
00:24:09.560 --> 00:24:13.790
Okay,
so there are two kinds of social anxiety performance situations.

411
00:24:13.940 --> 00:24:17.510
This is where like somebody like myself doing this,

412
00:24:17.690 --> 00:24:21.500
becoming credibly anxious because I'm acutely aware of what you'd think of me,

413
00:24:21.860 --> 00:24:26.810
which I am of course social interaction situations for we want to be out

414
00:24:26.811 --> 00:24:29.300
involved say in meeting people at a party and things like that.

415
00:24:29.570 --> 00:24:31.420
So these are typical social interactions,

416
00:24:31.421 --> 00:24:35.420
situations where you might have to initiate a conversation,
meet some strangers,

417
00:24:35.690 --> 00:24:37.850
go to parties,
meet people over for dinner.

418
00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:41.450
Meeting friends in the pub is a nightmare for a person with social anxiety

419
00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:43.460
that's been ours beforehand.
Preparing,

420
00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:48.590
expressing a personal opinions are being assertive or talking to people in

421
00:24:48.591 --> 00:24:53.180
authority and these are typical performance situations.
Public speaking,

422
00:24:53.210 --> 00:24:56.690
speaking in front of a class as eating,
drinking,

423
00:24:57.020 --> 00:24:58.830
believe or not being in the restroom.

424
00:24:58.831 --> 00:25:01.700
Some people would get incredibly anxious that people would get zero observing

425
00:25:01.701 --> 00:25:05.570
them in the restaurant,
which is very scary.
King sports in front of voters.

426
00:25:05.660 --> 00:25:08.030
I had a lovely example of a lad who is brought to me,

427
00:25:08.090 --> 00:25:12.500
very good tennis player and everybody taught that he was not performing because

428
00:25:12.501 --> 00:25:15.800
he was so anxious that he would,
he would do it perfectly,

429
00:25:16.010 --> 00:25:18.020
but it wasn't fun and got everybody out of the room.

430
00:25:18.260 --> 00:25:23.260
His problem was that he was so upset that people would see him sweating on the

431
00:25:23.421 --> 00:25:27.050
court,
that he couldn't perform,
not interesting to nothing.

432
00:25:27.051 --> 00:25:29.950
So when we clear that that was the end of that,
um,

433
00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:32.900
being caught out or making mistakes and the presence of others.

434
00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:36.290
So typically taught in the social situation might be,

435
00:25:36.291 --> 00:25:38.750
I have nothing interesting to say and people would think I'm boring.

436
00:25:38.780 --> 00:25:40.880
That's the great word and I hope nobody,

437
00:25:40.881 --> 00:25:44.040
you've see me blushing or sweating cause that's what everybody is afraid of.

438
00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:45.080
What an extraordinary set.

439
00:25:45.081 --> 00:25:50.030
And they'll see that an anxious in my eyes or my face and I hope nobody can see

440
00:25:50.031 --> 00:25:52.790
how anxious are young because if they do,
they'll think I'm weak and dust.

441
00:25:52.790 --> 00:25:55.610
The key to social anxiety,
people think that we're weak

442
00:25:57.290 --> 00:25:59.120
and these are kind of typical behaviors.

443
00:25:59.380 --> 00:26:02.300
Would you like me to go to what happens to a person to go to a party?

444
00:26:03.350 --> 00:26:04.580
Cause this is a classic example.

445
00:26:04.581 --> 00:26:07.370
It's so it starts maybe a couple of hours beforehand and this art,

446
00:26:07.371 --> 00:26:10.610
the rehearsing,
they check themselves in the mirror.
How do I look too?

447
00:26:10.611 --> 00:26:14.590
I look anxious to am I blushing,
am I sweating?
And then they start rehearsing.

448
00:26:14.690 --> 00:26:17.000
What am I going to say?
And what would people,

449
00:26:17.090 --> 00:26:20.540
what would be a good thing that are kind of topic if I were to bring it up at a

450
00:26:20.541 --> 00:26:25.210
social situation and then they get down to the parity or to the local club if

451
00:26:25.300 --> 00:26:28.070
the guy is more so than we go straight for the,
for the,
for the birds,

452
00:26:28.410 --> 00:26:31.810
it's thread thread for a pint.
Uh,

453
00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:35.930
most of the girls would go to the restroom and check on my blushing and
sweating.

454
00:26:37.190 --> 00:26:41.360
And then,
uh,
from that people were then stare at the,

455
00:26:41.490 --> 00:26:43.870
at the bare basic to the exit.

456
00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:48.570
People will spend a little bit of time maybe trying to stay away from the center

457
00:26:48.571 --> 00:26:53.130
of the crowd.
Really try not to initiate conversations.

458
00:26:53.740 --> 00:26:56.760
And if they do,
try and rehearse what to go,
going to say before to say it,

459
00:26:57.360 --> 00:27:00.070
and then go home to go home to do a post mortem.
She's upon a nightmare,

460
00:27:00.830 --> 00:27:03.990
not a nightmare.
And that's only just going down to the local pub.

461
00:27:04.110 --> 00:27:06.510
And that happens every solitary social situation.

462
00:27:06.840 --> 00:27:10.080
So the great thing about this is to be completely clear very,
very quickly.

463
00:27:11.250 --> 00:27:12.900
So it's caused by,
believe it or not,

464
00:27:12.901 --> 00:27:16.530
the same old gunslinger as the cause of death.
He's a reload character,
this guy.

465
00:27:17.010 --> 00:27:21.300
And basically what he's doing,
he has learned to misread faces.

466
00:27:21.870 --> 00:27:24.960
And it happens usually as a result of something that happens in our childhood

467
00:27:25.530 --> 00:27:30.450
where we say we're mid of fool of or marked in some way in some public
situation,

468
00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:34.680
either in a family situation,
very often at school or in some public situation.

469
00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:38.310
So our amygdala begins to misfire and misread faces.

470
00:27:40.410 --> 00:27:43.680
And the key again is the old cbts cause again.
And the good news,

471
00:27:43.681 --> 00:27:48.090
we can challenge the irrational belief and an unhealthy behaviors very quickly

472
00:27:48.170 --> 00:27:49.740
with in social anxiety.

473
00:27:50.040 --> 00:27:52.560
So the key for the danger for the socially anxious person,

474
00:27:52.590 --> 00:27:56.780
this is what we're worried about,
is that people will see it or anxious.
Uh,

475
00:27:57.150 --> 00:27:58.570
and if it's public speaking,
let's see,

476
00:27:58.600 --> 00:28:03.120
they're anxious and clam up and lose track of earlier and then everybody would

477
00:28:03.121 --> 00:28:07.050
judge him as weak and there's a failure and they weren't 100% certainty that

478
00:28:07.051 --> 00:28:09.000
everything Moscow well,
uh,

479
00:28:09.001 --> 00:28:11.160
and that nothing can go wrong and they can never come up.

480
00:28:11.820 --> 00:28:15.600
So the first thing I get them to,
to,
to understand is that we all came up,

481
00:28:15.900 --> 00:28:18.720
we all do is track for giving talks.
It was the norm.

482
00:28:18.890 --> 00:28:21.330
So we challenged our safe to be here,
which is always to check,

483
00:28:21.331 --> 00:28:22.230
check and double check.

484
00:28:23.940 --> 00:28:27.690
But the socially anxious person had social situations is what they're worried

485
00:28:27.691 --> 00:28:31.050
about.
The people will see all these physical symptoms of anxiety.

486
00:28:31.230 --> 00:28:33.120
They will see them blushing,
sweating,
believe or not.

487
00:28:33.121 --> 00:28:37.440
Some people would wear an extra jacket on even though it's very warm in the,
uh,

488
00:28:37.730 --> 00:28:39.900
in the pub.
Rather than see people,

489
00:28:40.780 --> 00:28:44.640
people's might see this sweat and their constant checking with the blushing and

490
00:28:44.641 --> 00:28:47.250
sweating.
So to me in a note to the restroom to check for that,

491
00:28:47.550 --> 00:28:50.900
but they have as an exaggerated picture of how bad any of these are.

492
00:28:51.390 --> 00:28:54.780
And they struggle often with conversation exercises.
This is a key thing.

493
00:28:55.110 --> 00:28:58.920
One of the things I teach people this conversation exercises to try and have

494
00:28:58.921 --> 00:29:00.080
them overcome things.

495
00:29:01.070 --> 00:29:04.200
So what we have to do is challenged our thinking and our behavior.

496
00:29:04.380 --> 00:29:05.041
And we have these,

497
00:29:05.041 --> 00:29:06.960
I'm not going to tell you what they are cause they're a secret.

498
00:29:07.350 --> 00:29:12.240
We call them embarrassment exercises and they're just fantastic.
I am not joking.

499
00:29:12.241 --> 00:29:16.380
I have seen grown men wilt and say I can't do that.

500
00:29:17.160 --> 00:29:20.190
I just counted up and this was like this if you want to get better than when I

501
00:29:20.191 --> 00:29:22.080
was two.
So actually these,

502
00:29:22.170 --> 00:29:26.220
these wonderful embarrassment exercise are incredibly powerful at actually

503
00:29:26.340 --> 00:29:27.390
getting rid of social anxiety.

504
00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:32.300
And we can clear it in a couple of sessions very quick.
And uh,
the,

505
00:29:32.330 --> 00:29:36.640
the lovely thing about them is that by the end I get rid of person.

506
00:29:36.660 --> 00:29:39.870
Social anxieties is a better way and kind of have them understanding one

507
00:29:39.871 --> 00:29:43.140
important thing.
That word,
none of us are to some partners.
We take pair

508
00:29:44.840 --> 00:29:48.760
that interesting.
So once I get them to realize we're nice,
important,

509
00:29:48.790 --> 00:29:52.110
we think we are an approach to this has been a sense of humor is their home and

510
00:29:52.111 --> 00:29:57.060
drag.
Okay.
Have you already had enough where they do four years pretty quickly?

511
00:29:57.780 --> 00:30:01.410
I we short to two minutes.
Okay.
Right.

512
00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:03.770
Phobias as two very quick.
A phobia.

513
00:30:03.790 --> 00:30:07.960
Simply an excessive fear of being exposed to a situation or a to toy.

514
00:30:07.961 --> 00:30:10.890
You think you're going to get incredibly anxious.
So these are typical ones.

515
00:30:10.891 --> 00:30:14.060
We all know the animals and insects ones.
Uh,

516
00:30:14.160 --> 00:30:17.190
what lots of people probably are also aware that when you're exposed to

517
00:30:17.191 --> 00:30:20.390
situation in that confined space is crowds open spaces,

518
00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:24.900
mortar where's for example are a huge issue,
lifts,
plans,
blood,
et cetera.

519
00:30:25.140 --> 00:30:29.150
So people got all these phobias about these things and they literally will not

520
00:30:29.151 --> 00:30:32.190
go on the motorway.
They walk with hospitals because of blood.

521
00:30:32.191 --> 00:30:36.300
The Walk to end two lifts at the fuse to go into churches and shopping centers

522
00:30:36.301 --> 00:30:39.690
and all the rest of it.
I grew up phobias where,
uh,

523
00:30:39.990 --> 00:30:42.530
we've become a fear of open spaces.
Uh,

524
00:30:42.650 --> 00:30:47.650
and it comes from the Greek word meaning I Gora which means open spaces.

525
00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:53.520
So I think their treatment is really to be on the CVT is the best way to treat

526
00:30:53.521 --> 00:30:54.900
them.
And now it's,
it doesn't work.

527
00:30:56.310 --> 00:31:00.310
And the media part thing about a phobia phobia is a red herring.
Is that,

528
00:31:00.360 --> 00:31:04.080
do you know what a red herring,
it's a red herring.
It's like a false trail.

529
00:31:04.980 --> 00:31:09.330
And the real problem is that people think that the plane is the phobia or

530
00:31:09.331 --> 00:31:12.480
they've lifted the phobia or the shopping Sandra to port.
It's not,

531
00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:15.750
it's walked up,
I think is going to happen when I'm exposed to it.

532
00:31:16.020 --> 00:31:19.260
And that's to see for me,
I,
it's actually,
I think it's going to happen,

533
00:31:19.410 --> 00:31:23.490
isn't going to get incredibly anxious when you teach people how to deal with

534
00:31:23.491 --> 00:31:26.460
that because it's exactly the same as having a panic attack.

535
00:31:26.461 --> 00:31:29.760
But even at very similar response to,
again,

536
00:31:29.761 --> 00:31:31.830
the guns are firing in exactly the same way.

537
00:31:32.070 --> 00:31:35.630
So when you teach people how to deal with that and exposed them to the forming,

538
00:31:35.730 --> 00:31:37.830
you've turned up very quickly.
So I would come,

539
00:31:37.831 --> 00:31:40.500
any of people who come to me with two or three,
four years.

540
00:31:40.501 --> 00:31:43.380
But the good news for you is if you can learn how to deal with one phobia,

541
00:31:43.740 --> 00:31:46.700
you deal with them all cause the same process truth.

542
00:31:49.090 --> 00:31:52.740
I think that's basically all that I am going to talk with [inaudible] I was in

543
00:31:52.750 --> 00:31:54.170
Qa now,
uh,

544
00:31:55.080 --> 00:31:58.200
I think just for your own interest if flagging is actually a panic is probably

545
00:31:58.201 --> 00:32:01.530
sit available in some shops around in the past I've seen there's a KFC here and

546
00:32:01.531 --> 00:32:06.000
there and we are doing another reprint.
And uh,
it w it will be very available.

547
00:32:06.210 --> 00:32:09.890
There's all to four year,
two videos,
which have been,
uh,

548
00:32:10.470 --> 00:32:13.290
very much watched by many,
many people which go along with the book.

549
00:32:13.740 --> 00:32:16.320
And it's very interesting.
One that I've also did with panic away,

550
00:32:16.321 --> 00:32:21.320
which has been seen by something like 330,000 papers or something like that at

551
00:32:21.321 --> 00:32:23.820
to stage on panic attacks.
I'm not interesting around the world.

552
00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:28.050
So really important.
Okay.
All right,

553
00:32:32.960 --> 00:32:37.040
<v 0>great.
Thank you very much.</v>

554
00:32:37.430 --> 00:32:40.030
Thanks for your attention.
I was going to

555
00:32:40.030 --> 00:32:40.701
<v 4>detail talk,</v>

556
00:32:40.701 --> 00:32:44.730
I think you actually answered a lot of my questions is shuffling them letter my

557
00:32:44.731 --> 00:32:47.640
seat there and trying to think of so,
so new ones.
Um,

558
00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:51.020
something that you and I have spoken about in the past,

559
00:32:51.021 --> 00:32:56.021
which I'd love you to explain to our audience a bit more is the science behind

560
00:32:56.900 --> 00:32:59.620
why people might wake up feeling anxious.

561
00:32:59.690 --> 00:33:02.030
<v 1>So this is very,
very interesting.
One and many,</v>

562
00:33:02.031 --> 00:33:05.670
many people come to me with general anxiety.
And the first thing they say to me,

563
00:33:05.890 --> 00:33:06.420
there's,

564
00:33:06.420 --> 00:33:10.160
I could open the morning and I wake up in the morning and before I can even

565
00:33:10.161 --> 00:33:15.140
start taking about today,
I find my stomach is nuts.
I'm feeling very tense,

566
00:33:15.141 --> 00:33:18.990
my muscles are tense,
my heart baby going bit quicker and I feel loved.

567
00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:21.470
MNEMONIC can I kind of work out what's actually happening?

568
00:33:21.890 --> 00:33:23.780
So it was actually very separate when you experienced them.

569
00:33:24.110 --> 00:33:26.270
So what's actually happening is when we're asleep,

570
00:33:26.780 --> 00:33:29.000
we dream for the last four hours,

571
00:33:29.030 --> 00:33:32.630
particularly of the theater or a cycle that's we do most of our dreaming.

572
00:33:33.050 --> 00:33:36.140
And as for the close,
we get to waking up the more dreaming we do,

573
00:33:36.230 --> 00:33:37.580
we call this rem sleep,

574
00:33:37.970 --> 00:33:40.440
which is rapid eye movement sleep because that's what happens when you're,

575
00:33:40.660 --> 00:33:42.070
so all that's happening in,
in,

576
00:33:42.071 --> 00:33:47.071
in rem sleep is that we're reorganizing our memories for her to date of the date

577
00:33:47.210 --> 00:33:48.230
of the previous day.

578
00:33:48.650 --> 00:33:52.280
So what happens is the two key players in that are the hippocampus,

579
00:33:52.281 --> 00:33:55.100
which is your memory box and the Amygdala,
which as you've gone slimmer,

580
00:33:55.490 --> 00:33:57.050
so what actually is happening in the brain,

581
00:33:57.200 --> 00:34:00.410
the brain is actually creating almost a literal story.

582
00:34:00.500 --> 00:34:03.320
As all of these memories I've been bounced back,
back and forth,

583
00:34:03.350 --> 00:34:06.390
all of everything that happened during the day,
uh,

584
00:34:06.410 --> 00:34:08.810
creating almost like a little story for it.
So you for example,

585
00:34:08.840 --> 00:34:11.870
[inaudible] had been shared through the first or something like that in your,

586
00:34:11.871 --> 00:34:13.610
in your mind,
but you don't remember any of this.

587
00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:18.650
But what actually happens is the gunslinger is firing full blast just as if you

588
00:34:18.651 --> 00:34:20.690
were awake during those periods.

589
00:34:21.230 --> 00:34:23.180
So actually what actually happens is you wake up,

590
00:34:23.390 --> 00:34:28.040
you have no memory of the actual dream but the gunslinger is affects the

591
00:34:28.041 --> 00:34:32.300
Adrenalin effects are still going on.
Well actually we started to do dentists.

592
00:34:32.301 --> 00:34:35.240
We started to,
Oh God,
it must be something terrible's going to happen today.

593
00:34:35.300 --> 00:34:35.651
So no,

594
00:34:35.651 --> 00:34:38.620
I started to visualize what's going to have to do and then I really make myself

595
00:34:38.621 --> 00:34:39.860
access ivory.

596
00:34:41.030 --> 00:34:44.450
And the reason by the way had the guns thing or is so active in general anxiety

597
00:34:44.451 --> 00:34:47.000
it's cause it's active during the day cause we're constantly worrying all the

598
00:34:47.001 --> 00:34:50.270
time.
So it's more a worry in the data and the more you're going to worry at

599
00:34:50.271 --> 00:34:52.580
nighttime.
But the trouble is,
I don't remembers,

600
00:34:54.020 --> 00:34:59.020
<v 4>I know you also mentioned that sometimes there's filing of the anxieties that</v>

601
00:35:00.171 --> 00:35:04.280
we've had throughout the day can sometimes reawakened a memory or an experience

602
00:35:04.281 --> 00:35:05.114
in the past.

603
00:35:05.520 --> 00:35:08.060
<v 1>Yes.
Yes,
exactly.
Like I for example,</v>

604
00:35:08.120 --> 00:35:11.870
if I do have a memory of something negative that happened to be from my dream

605
00:35:11.871 --> 00:35:16.070
during the night,
it new re re re re establish the order pattern again.

606
00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:20.930
But I think the,
the important part is that the gunslinger is,
it's a secret.

607
00:35:20.960 --> 00:35:24.500
If you can learn to understand the physical nature of anxiety,

608
00:35:25.070 --> 00:35:28.310
you'll never worry about anxiety again because that's actually what really

609
00:35:28.311 --> 00:35:32.210
causes the problem.
It's the,
it's the physical side.
And we don't understand.

610
00:35:32.510 --> 00:35:35.690
People don't understand the worrying,
they understand the catastrophize,

611
00:35:35.930 --> 00:35:38.680
but they just don't get that it's a physical condition.

612
00:35:38.920 --> 00:35:41.230
But the wonderful thing about that is that the Amygdala,

613
00:35:41.260 --> 00:35:44.620
his as the wall results completely manageable.

614
00:35:44.950 --> 00:35:47.440
You can put manners on them very quickly if you know what to do.

615
00:35:47.920 --> 00:35:50.230
It's when you don't understand them that you have a problem.

616
00:35:51.760 --> 00:35:54.950
<v 0>That's the one way.
Maybe I'm putting some manners on an errand.</v>

617
00:35:55.220 --> 00:36:00.090
And do you have any,
uh,
everybody analogy in your book holds spilled milk?

618
00:36:00.280 --> 00:36:02.660
<v 1>Both spoke.
Yes.
Yeah.
Tell us about that.
Yeah.</v>

619
00:36:02.670 --> 00:36:05.820
So if I ask you about what do you visualize when you visualize Belzberg,

620
00:36:05.920 --> 00:36:08.440
can somebody tell me what your baseline is when your peers racialized?

621
00:36:10.170 --> 00:36:14.640
<v 0>Anybody want to share?
I heard a man mess.
Smell,</v>

622
00:36:14.860 --> 00:36:18.910
<v 1>smell horrible.
You can see it in the car first and the mass and the MOCHA.
Okay.</v>

623
00:36:19.230 --> 00:36:21.040
So what I actually say to a person as well,

624
00:36:21.070 --> 00:36:25.000
suppose I took the tiniest drop of milk and put it on the table.

625
00:36:25.330 --> 00:36:28.080
Would that also be his best book?
Of course.

626
00:36:28.900 --> 00:36:32.560
But while we do instinctively is via visualize the drop as the pudding.

627
00:36:33.340 --> 00:36:35.620
So it's a wonderful technique and CBT,

628
00:36:36.040 --> 00:36:38.230
which is that if you're catastrophizing about something,

629
00:36:38.340 --> 00:36:42.430
you go to Japan and paper and you have to prove on paper that you're

630
00:36:42.431 --> 00:36:43.690
catastrophizing is true.

631
00:36:44.680 --> 00:36:48.040
And why that's so important is to remember that I was showing you that the area

632
00:36:48.041 --> 00:36:50.830
of the brain called the logic bucks.
Do you know what I been purchase your,

633
00:36:51.070 --> 00:36:55.040
you're the,
the rational part.
It's the,
it's the executive brand at the,

634
00:36:55.110 --> 00:36:58.900
it's called the dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex.
But this guy has the job,

635
00:36:59.140 --> 00:37:03.790
I'll put manners on everything else in the brand.
So when you write things down,

636
00:37:03.850 --> 00:37:08.590
it gets involved and you know,
have to rationally explain to him,

637
00:37:08.740 --> 00:37:11.290
imagine your expand to your boss.
Do you know what I mean?

638
00:37:11.440 --> 00:37:13.810
That all this catastrophizing,
it's true.
And of course you can't.

639
00:37:14.600 --> 00:37:16.100
So the minute that happens with them,

640
00:37:16.150 --> 00:37:19.570
you drop as Pittsburgh and actually it's a great way of teaching years have

641
00:37:19.990 --> 00:37:20.560
actually done,

642
00:37:20.560 --> 00:37:25.030
is it a real problem or is it just a visualized problem and 90% of the time or

643
00:37:25.031 --> 00:37:26.180
the way it's a visual as well.

644
00:37:26.920 --> 00:37:27.753
<v 0>That's right.
Yeah.</v>

645
00:37:29.020 --> 00:37:30.000
<v 4>Don't ask him.
Uh,</v>

646
00:37:30.100 --> 00:37:34.000
just one more question before I open up to some audience questions.
Um,

647
00:37:34.480 --> 00:37:35.313
there's been,

648
00:37:35.530 --> 00:37:39.550
it's been a pretty big sea change in Ireland over the last number of years

649
00:37:39.551 --> 00:37:43.250
regarding this topic amongst the general public.
Well,
so,
uh,

650
00:37:43.310 --> 00:37:46.270
you've mentioned to me there's been some changes to the GP trainees.

651
00:37:46.560 --> 00:37:49.620
<v 1>Yeah.
I think what's happening is most of the older gps,</v>

652
00:37:50.170 --> 00:37:52.860
almost a grandfather dies or the state,
uh,

653
00:37:52.890 --> 00:37:56.420
but most of the order gps would not have had the benefit of,
um,

654
00:37:56.550 --> 00:37:59.330
mental health techniques.
Do you know what I mean?
But no,
the,
the,

655
00:37:59.500 --> 00:38:01.880
the assessment trainees or the dealer,

656
00:38:01.881 --> 00:38:06.690
the trainee gps who are being trained to be general practitioners are a tank for

657
00:38:06.691 --> 00:38:10.500
the being exposed to what the cause is,
CBT concepts and techniques.

658
00:38:10.890 --> 00:38:12.660
So it doesn't necessarily mean that they will,

659
00:38:12.720 --> 00:38:16.020
all of us have the time or the energy or the space to,
to use to,

660
00:38:16.021 --> 00:38:18.190
but at least they have a much better understanding of them.

661
00:38:18.191 --> 00:38:20.310
Do you know what I mean?
Which is I think a way of the food.

662
00:38:20.480 --> 00:38:24.510
But one of my big things is I actually believe that there's a big problem

663
00:38:24.511 --> 00:38:26.820
nowadays that we all believe we need an expert.

664
00:38:27.420 --> 00:38:29.040
We do any fear to go to the toilet.

665
00:38:29.041 --> 00:38:32.910
We nearly need to have an expert who tend to get us to the titles.
In reality,

666
00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:36.810
we all have a wonderful in the personal resilience skills,

667
00:38:37.140 --> 00:38:40.800
but what we need is information and knowledge and techniques.

668
00:38:41.250 --> 00:38:45.270
So what I would really appeal to,
everybody has read,
read books like this.

669
00:38:45.290 --> 00:38:48.350
Do you know what I mean?
Develop these techniques in yourself and they can,

670
00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:51.060
you can be enormously helpful to other people in order to be in.

671
00:38:51.061 --> 00:38:56.010
If you have these,
uh,
tactics herself,
uh,
and people in your family.

672
00:38:56.830 --> 00:38:59.700
Really important to me that we need to be resilient.
You know,

673
00:39:00.080 --> 00:39:02.970
and what I I'd love to do is I'd have to do a rating thing.

674
00:39:02.971 --> 00:39:07.020
Could I do a reading thing?
Can I do,
would you like data rate and game?
Right?

675
00:39:07.100 --> 00:39:07.510
Okay.

676
00:39:07.510 --> 00:39:10.650
I want you to visualize if you have a piece of paper you can do it or otherwise

677
00:39:10.651 --> 00:39:14.070
visualize in your head,
um,
uh,

678
00:39:14.100 --> 00:39:17.910
align straightline with one at one and a 100 or the other end.
Is that okay?

679
00:39:18.390 --> 00:39:21.090
Can you visualize that?
Okay.

680
00:39:21.240 --> 00:39:26.160
Now I want you to give yourself one is your crap and a hundred days you're the

681
00:39:26.161 --> 00:39:27.720
bee's knees.
Is that okay?

682
00:39:28.210 --> 00:39:30.720
So I want you to give yourself a rating between one and a hundred.

683
00:39:33.260 --> 00:39:38.090
<v 3>You don't,
okay?
At global rating.</v>

684
00:39:39.180 --> 00:39:43.950
<v 1>No.
I want you to visualize for other people,
rich,
this is your chance.</v>

685
00:39:45.150 --> 00:39:49.050
They really think I'm the bee's knees.
Okay?
We'll be all done that.

686
00:39:50.820 --> 00:39:51.653
<v 3>Okay?</v>

687
00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:53.830
<v 1>Now I'm going to give you a few situations.</v>

688
00:39:54.370 --> 00:39:58.370
You're diagnosed with depression and you put on antidepressants and word cause I

689
00:39:58.380 --> 00:40:01.270
told your friends and colleagues,
where do you register at a time?

690
00:40:03.560 --> 00:40:06.150
I'm where do,
where do you visualize other people who were rich?

691
00:40:07.590 --> 00:40:08.423
<v 3>Okay,</v>

692
00:40:10.120 --> 00:40:12.010
<v 1>let's take another situation.
You're,</v>

693
00:40:12.011 --> 00:40:17.011
you're a real high flyer out to job and then you're fired and suddenly your uh,

694
00:40:18.430 --> 00:40:21.880
financial situation,
it takes a nose dive and your mortgage is not in trouble,

695
00:40:22.180 --> 00:40:25.380
you know,
fighting with your partner.
Would you rate up then

696
00:40:28.300 --> 00:40:29.260
I remember with dozers,
Reggie.

697
00:40:32.160 --> 00:40:32.993
<v 3>Okay.</v>

698
00:40:33.900 --> 00:40:35.000
<v 1>But some people I do.</v>

699
00:40:35.270 --> 00:40:40.270
Your social media is actually a trans people take care of.

700
00:40:40.761 --> 00:40:43.400
Just yuck.
Where would you rate yourself then?

701
00:40:45.750 --> 00:40:50.720
Where do you think others would rate you?
Interesting.
There's game isn't it?
Now?

702
00:40:50.730 --> 00:40:53.400
Hands up.
Anybody who did,
who you didn't change the rating

703
00:40:55.400 --> 00:40:58.290
when you are not as group.
Is that okay?
Cause we all played this game.

704
00:40:58.320 --> 00:40:59.800
We called it to raise again,
don't treat it.

705
00:41:00.450 --> 00:41:04.860
We spent our lives raising each other and raising ourselves and this is what

706
00:41:04.861 --> 00:41:08.970
causes so much problems and mental health because one of the big problems and

707
00:41:08.971 --> 00:41:10.760
anxiety is that we're spending all our time reading.

708
00:41:10.761 --> 00:41:14.280
I said so can be Retros House.
Is it possible to raise ourselves?

709
00:41:15.570 --> 00:41:19.620
Can we raise the sense,
can we read to give a d?
No,
it's actually,

710
00:41:19.621 --> 00:41:24.210
it's actually a trick because in real life is there any skill that we can

711
00:41:24.211 --> 00:41:28.970
actually use that can rate ourselves the rest of children.

712
00:41:30.200 --> 00:41:33.210
So in reality,
uh,
we,
we,

713
00:41:33.320 --> 00:41:37.360
I asked her to join the Ragga dog club and raggy dog club is,
is,

714
00:41:37.490 --> 00:41:40.220
is a wonderful case of which I am chief bottle washer.

715
00:41:40.220 --> 00:41:43.510
So I'm very comfortable here.
But to be a member of the get on top,
he Mitchell,

716
00:41:43.550 --> 00:41:47.630
you have to mess it up.
Is that okay?
So I'm very,
I'm very happy there is that.

717
00:41:47.631 --> 00:41:49.580
Okay.
But there are tree roots.

718
00:41:50.240 --> 00:41:52.490
The first word is you're not allowed waitress half as a person.

719
00:41:53.810 --> 00:41:57.500
Second road is you're not allowed to accept anybody else's rating of you as a

720
00:41:57.501 --> 00:42:02.040
person.
But the third one is you are allowed to Rachel behavior but not true.

721
00:42:02.410 --> 00:42:06.770
Andrew scares but not yourself.
What a wonderful case to be.
Now the wreck,

722
00:42:06.800 --> 00:42:09.520
it comes from a cartoon series in the 80s Rod,
is it a,
does it?

723
00:42:09.521 --> 00:42:11.750
We've been there as a working perfect of a trend to me,
Jack,

724
00:42:11.751 --> 00:42:13.130
then it's like a tired,

725
00:42:13.131 --> 00:42:17.520
we called the rejects from so as high tech by my,

726
00:42:17.950 --> 00:42:19.730
uh,
for mental health.
Is that,
okay?

727
00:42:20.060 --> 00:42:22.100
So I have hundreds of cars at carry ragged on tobacco.

728
00:42:23.010 --> 00:42:28.010
The guys won't carry ragged [inaudible] you know what I mean?
Is that okay?

729
00:42:28.011 --> 00:42:30.890
But what it does,
it,
it kind of as a way of believe or not,

730
00:42:31.160 --> 00:42:34.070
I never have a problem with a person with depression who comes into me and raced

731
00:42:34.071 --> 00:42:36.850
themselves a team.
They had grabbed a rag down.

732
00:42:36.860 --> 00:42:39.860
Basically my problems are the high achievers,

733
00:42:40.550 --> 00:42:44.870
the people that come in and read and have some 95 or 97 and then dropped to 90

734
00:42:44.871 --> 00:42:48.770
and the can't handles.
I remember one protector guy said to me,

735
00:42:49.370 --> 00:42:52.970
what do you mean I can't,
I can't bathe myself.
I live for my rating.

736
00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:57.320
That's all I live for.
I said,
well why here?
In other words,

737
00:42:57.740 --> 00:43:00.440
if you were,
if you're winning after written,
why have you come to see me?

738
00:43:00.800 --> 00:43:03.630
Because we actually don't win a race and we just put us out in this fashion.

739
00:43:04.780 --> 00:43:08.320
<v 0>Interesting.
That's really insightful.</v>

740
00:43:08.590 --> 00:43:11.110
I think we probably have time for maybe two questions.

741
00:43:13.890 --> 00:43:16.210
Nope.
Okay,
great.

742
00:43:20.100 --> 00:43:21.210
Thank you.
Um,

743
00:43:21.500 --> 00:43:26.500
[inaudible] like I have a collection of off something that I think I read

744
00:43:27.551 --> 00:43:28.121
correctly.

745
00:43:28.121 --> 00:43:33.121
It will say that suicide is driven by the logic side of brain and nope,

746
00:43:34.450 --> 00:43:35.650
what happens in suicide.

747
00:43:35.680 --> 00:43:39.680
It could be wants to do what happens to the stereotype is that a part of rain or

748
00:43:39.690 --> 00:43:44.650
is completely negative and we start to have this room and if we call and those

749
00:43:44.651 --> 00:43:46.820
women they agree to talks about that.
I,
I,

750
00:43:47.320 --> 00:43:51.050
<v 1>uh,
a fair number one,
but the one that kills people,</v>

751
00:43:51.051 --> 00:43:56.000
the one that really distressed as people is that they begin to believe that this

752
00:43:56.001 --> 00:44:01.001
incredible distress that they're feeding will never end and that they're the

753
00:44:01.251 --> 00:44:02.960
failure for letting it happen.

754
00:44:03.740 --> 00:44:06.590
So the only way they can get rid of this incredible distress,

755
00:44:06.591 --> 00:44:09.170
which is by the way,
the ruminations are going on in our head,

756
00:44:09.920 --> 00:44:11.130
is actually to take the wrong knife.

757
00:44:12.050 --> 00:44:15.500
And that's incredibly constant from survivors.
Do you know what I mean?

758
00:44:15.920 --> 00:44:18.840
They can over there today,
and it doesn't matter whether you,
uh,

759
00:44:18.980 --> 00:44:23.030
you are thinking of taking your own life because of depression or because of

760
00:44:23.031 --> 00:44:23.810
shame,

761
00:44:23.810 --> 00:44:27.480
because of something terrible has happened to you and you've been phoned out,
uh,

762
00:44:27.500 --> 00:44:29.270
or whether his financial problems,

763
00:44:29.690 --> 00:44:34.210
it's that you get so that you believe that the problem is in solvable by any

764
00:44:34.211 --> 00:44:35.044
other means.

765
00:44:35.440 --> 00:44:39.520
And it's going on night and day in your head and it caused a terrible distress.

766
00:44:39.521 --> 00:44:43.140
Won't go where you get to the point where I can put up into distress any longer.

767
00:44:43.240 --> 00:44:47.890
It's not that you want today is you want to stop to distress,
distress,

768
00:44:49.650 --> 00:44:51.820
distress is your emotional mind.
Do you know what I mean?

769
00:44:51.821 --> 00:44:54.240
That's your emotional mind.
Now,
that's coming from an emotional,

770
00:44:54.610 --> 00:44:56.050
but what actually happens is the,

771
00:44:56.530 --> 00:45:00.420
normally there's a kind of a check balance coming from the logical mind.

772
00:45:00.510 --> 00:45:01.640
Do you know what I mean?
Eh.

773
00:45:02.070 --> 00:45:05.740
So your logical mind normally keeps your emotion mind in check,

774
00:45:06.250 --> 00:45:07.720
but once it turns negative,

775
00:45:07.870 --> 00:45:11.220
it swamps the logical brain and the logic brain just can't get a look at.

776
00:45:11.670 --> 00:45:15.810
And that's what happens.
And when the person makes and attempt and surveys,

777
00:45:16.780 --> 00:45:21.010
very often they're on the snapped back to kind of a situation where their

778
00:45:21.011 --> 00:45:24.080
logical brain and maybe has a better chance of being reengaged to do,

779
00:45:24.170 --> 00:45:27.400
particularly if the get some help.
But if they don't get,

780
00:45:27.401 --> 00:45:31.660
have to revert back to where they were.
You know what I mean?
It's a very,

781
00:45:31.661 --> 00:45:32.494
very good question.

782
00:45:34.120 --> 00:45:35.140
<v 4>Final question.</v>

783
00:45:43.930 --> 00:45:44.763
What's

784
00:45:49.530 --> 00:45:54.430
really interesting talk you were talking about social anxiety gets how you can

785
00:45:54.431 --> 00:45:57.790
deal with it yourself.
My question is more relationship,

786
00:45:57.791 --> 00:46:02.130
how you deal with people that are arranging with social anxiety and I think your

787
00:46:02.140 --> 00:46:06.040
first urge is to want to push them into these types of situations.

788
00:46:06.550 --> 00:46:11.120
I'm just wondering like doing nice.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It won't work.
It,

789
00:46:11.290 --> 00:46:11.940
it's a bit like

790
00:46:11.940 --> 00:46:14.570
<v 1>if,
for example,
you have a person with a motorway and phobia,</v>

791
00:46:15.810 --> 00:46:17.160
you can get them onto the motorway of,

792
00:46:17.161 --> 00:46:20.510
unless you understand what's happened to them and what's going to happen and how

793
00:46:20.511 --> 00:46:21.344
would you deal with it,

794
00:46:21.770 --> 00:46:25.080
they're never going to be confident they're going to meet today and the next

795
00:46:25.081 --> 00:46:26.690
time next manager turned around and going to become,

796
00:46:26.970 --> 00:46:30.300
if you force the press where it's social anxiety into social situations to get

797
00:46:30.301 --> 00:46:33.360
worse because they need the help,
the need to techniques.

798
00:46:34.110 --> 00:46:38.700
But the good news is that once they understand what's going on and do some of my

799
00:46:38.970 --> 00:46:41.850
famous embarrassment exercise very quickly,

800
00:46:41.851 --> 00:46:45.810
they grab what's actually happening to him in social situations and you just

801
00:46:45.811 --> 00:46:49.120
give them a few little techniques and skills and the drive.

802
00:46:49.150 --> 00:46:52.450
Do you know what I mean?
So I think that they,
they,
they really,
uh,

803
00:46:52.520 --> 00:46:56.670
north lot of people will benefit from say reading the book,

804
00:46:56.730 --> 00:46:59.910
looking at the videos and if necessary,
going for a little bit of how it,

805
00:46:59.911 --> 00:47:03.510
because to be honest with you,
it,
if you get to the right person,

806
00:47:03.511 --> 00:47:07.520
this can be sorted out really,
really fast.
Do you know what I mean?
And uh,

807
00:47:07.740 --> 00:47:11.340
but never push it person social anxiety because it won't be all dirty work.

808
00:47:12.480 --> 00:47:16.560
<v 4>Thank you for that.
Do you have,
has a question.
Hey,
you're our last one.</v>

809
00:47:18.630 --> 00:47:20.070
Thank you for that.
Um,
just a quick,

810
00:47:20.670 --> 00:47:25.590
why is it so quick to actually retrain the brain in a couple of sessions and,

811
00:47:25.990 --> 00:47:29.940
<v 1>well,
I suppose by the time a person,
usually you say w would come to see me,</v>

812
00:47:29.941 --> 00:47:31.350
they are really anxious.

813
00:47:31.380 --> 00:47:35.430
If you want a person like that to actually need to do something about it.
Um,

814
00:47:35.790 --> 00:47:39.750
I think what,
when we say it's,
it's not so much that it's quick,

815
00:47:40.380 --> 00:47:43.230
but if they did that,
when I give them exercises,

816
00:47:43.231 --> 00:47:45.930
they have to keep repeating those exercise over and over again.

817
00:47:45.931 --> 00:47:48.420
Do you know what I mean?
And the thing about the brain is the brand,

818
00:47:48.421 --> 00:47:51.180
the first time doesn't get it or gets it a little bit.

819
00:47:51.181 --> 00:47:52.530
The second time it gets a little bit.

820
00:47:52.531 --> 00:47:56.160
The third time it's getting it more for time is getting it more by the time you

821
00:47:56.161 --> 00:47:59.340
had done a 10 times as we need.
Got It.
So that's the way the brain works.

822
00:47:59.341 --> 00:48:01.980
If you think about it,
if you are trying to learn the skill,
for example,

823
00:48:02.010 --> 00:48:04.500
learning how to drive a car,
you don't cringe at the car,

824
00:48:04.710 --> 00:48:06.510
get some techniques and go and drive the car.

825
00:48:06.720 --> 00:48:09.190
You practice and you make mistakes and you're practicing to make mistakes.

826
00:48:09.630 --> 00:48:12.600
But gradually you find you're getting happier and happier and suddenly becomes

827
00:48:12.601 --> 00:48:14.640
instinctive.
And that's what happens in your brain.

828
00:48:14.820 --> 00:48:19.820
We call that neuroplasticity the ability to change your brain pathways and the

829
00:48:20.371 --> 00:48:24.390
good news is that something like do you make of the changes almost instantly,

830
00:48:24.510 --> 00:48:27.510
you know really quickly so you can turn him around quite quickly.

831
00:48:27.870 --> 00:48:30.990
But social things I used because it's involving tracks between your,

832
00:48:31.260 --> 00:48:33.900
your emotions and your logical brain takes a little bit longer.

833
00:48:34.020 --> 00:48:35.460
Do you know what I mean?
You have to do a bit more work,

834
00:48:35.580 --> 00:48:40.500
but I'm going be twice so quick because he's a very,
he's a,
he's a tech Oregon.

835
00:48:40.501 --> 00:48:45.060
He's very basic kid.
He doesn't get it,
you know,
so he,
he,
he,
he,
his job,

836
00:48:45.120 --> 00:48:48.450
if you can imagine the guy is talking to the love is somewhere with headphones

837
00:48:48.451 --> 00:48:52.080
on and somebody shows danger when he does pass fire.
Do you know what I mean?

838
00:48:52.081 --> 00:48:55.290
So somebody says don't the dangerous.
So he does a danger,
you know,
he,

839
00:48:55.350 --> 00:48:57.990
he doesn't really think it out,
but he actually,

840
00:48:58.020 --> 00:48:59.790
he actually don't play us very quickly.

841
00:48:59.960 --> 00:49:03.000
And it's really interesting to see this in practice by the way.

842
00:49:03.001 --> 00:49:05.490
The thing or is really important in depression as well.

843
00:49:05.500 --> 00:49:09.300
He's probably the major cause of depression because for example,
the colleague,

844
00:49:09.390 --> 00:49:12.780
a friend of mine from [inaudible] remarks verge,
she,
for example,

845
00:49:12.781 --> 00:49:15.840
they just fascinating experiment where she took all of these people with

846
00:49:15.841 --> 00:49:20.500
depression and scanned or a link to this responses to something negative doing

847
00:49:20.530 --> 00:49:21.540
twin negative fifth.

848
00:49:22.200 --> 00:49:26.310
And actually what was really interesting was that a bit by bit,

849
00:49:26.980 --> 00:49:28.340
or when she was doing our scanning,

850
00:49:28.370 --> 00:49:31.580
she knows that every salary person there and make it as overactive,

851
00:49:32.220 --> 00:49:36.980
every solitary one when they got some treatment for a week even.

852
00:49:36.981 --> 00:49:39.900
Do you know what I mean?
That even,
even though their depression was lifted,

853
00:49:40.650 --> 00:49:42.510
she could actually tell the ones that we're going to improve.

854
00:49:42.511 --> 00:49:44.310
The ones that are working on improved cause they're making it went back to

855
00:49:44.311 --> 00:49:48.940
normal.
So not fascinating.
This protector take Oregon,
unfortunately,

856
00:49:48.960 --> 00:49:52.570
is pretty important in our life and it causes most of the difficulties there.

857
00:49:52.590 --> 00:49:54.960
They're nice,
but he is very,
very transparent.

858
00:49:55.360 --> 00:49:59.800
<v 0>That's ramping here.
Talk Safari.
Unfortunately,
we're out of time.</v>

859
00:49:59.810 --> 00:50:03.770
I know it's more effective for you as I'm sure our audience,
Debo.
Dan,

860
00:50:03.800 --> 00:50:04.760
thank you very much.

861
00:50:05.100 --> 00:50:10.100
<v 3>[inaudible].</v>
