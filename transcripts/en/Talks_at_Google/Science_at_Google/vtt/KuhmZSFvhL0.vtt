1
00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:10.570
[inaudible].

2
00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:14.180
<v 0>Thank you,
David.
Thanks very much.
Can everybody hear me in the back?</v>

3
00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:19.520
So I get to talk about my trips,
but you don't,
it doesn't,
it doesn't seem fair.

4
00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:23.570
Um,
so I'm going to just talk for about 10 minutes and just tell you a little bit

5
00:00:23.571 --> 00:00:27.570
about what this book's about and then I'd love to take your questions,
um,
uh,
and,

6
00:00:27.571 --> 00:00:31.790
and let your interest,
uh,
dictate the path that we take this afternoon.

7
00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:36.740
Uh,
first,
thanks.
Thank you very much for coming.
This book,
uh,

8
00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:38.750
is a real departure for me.
Um,

9
00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:41.540
those of you who know me as someone who writes about food might think it's a

10
00:00:41.541 --> 00:00:45.680
little weird that,
um,
turning to secondary clicks,
but in my head there's a,

11
00:00:45.681 --> 00:00:48.020
there is some continuity as well as change.

12
00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:53.050
And the continuity is that I see my writing about food as part of a larger

13
00:00:53.751 --> 00:00:57.080
interest in writing about nature.
And you know,

14
00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:01.010
the way we eat affects nature dramatically more than anything else we do

15
00:01:01.011 --> 00:01:03.970
actually,
in terms of changing the landscape of,
of,

16
00:01:03.971 --> 00:01:07.940
of the planet and the atmosphere.
And I mean it's,
it's one of the,

17
00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:10.310
it's your most powerful engagement with the natural world.

18
00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.940
And I've always been interested in that engagement.
And,
um,

19
00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:18.110
we use nature and plants,
especially for,
for many things.

20
00:01:18.111 --> 00:01:21.830
Food is an obvious one.
Um,
beauty is another,

21
00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:27.040
but something we almost all use plants for that I've always been kind of curious

22
00:01:27.741 --> 00:01:30.140
about is to change consciousness.

23
00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:35.090
Most of us today probably use the plan to change the contents of your mind or at

24
00:01:35.091 --> 00:01:38.510
least the feeling tone in your mind.
Uh,
you know,

25
00:01:38.511 --> 00:01:43.511
whether it was coffee or tea or a or a cigarette or a cannabis or whatever it

26
00:01:43.581 --> 00:01:47.180
is.
I mean,
this is something we do and every culture on earth does it,
uh,

27
00:01:47.181 --> 00:01:50.280
with the,
with the one exception that proves the rule,

28
00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.670
the [inaudible] do not have any plant drugs,

29
00:01:52.671 --> 00:01:56.060
but it's only because none of them grow where they live as soon as they go

30
00:01:56.061 --> 00:01:59.160
somewhere else they get with the program.
Uh,

31
00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.690
so it's been a long standing interest and,
and to me,

32
00:02:02.691 --> 00:02:04.970
it's all part of that story about this,

33
00:02:04.971 --> 00:02:08.990
this fascinating engagement we have with other species,
uh,
that defines us.

34
00:02:08.991 --> 00:02:12.350
And reveals a lot about us.
Um,
so I,
so that,

35
00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.190
and I wrote a little bit about cannabis in botany of desire and,
uh,

36
00:02:16.191 --> 00:02:20.480
and I wrote a long piece about growing opium and my garden,
uh,

37
00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:24.890
back in the 90s,
and I've written about medical marijuana.
So I had this interest.

38
00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:30.140
And then along comes this new research which I began reading about.
Um,

39
00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:35.170
in 2010 I read about a really interesting odd study where researchers at Nyu and

40
00:02:39.141 --> 00:02:43.580
Johns Hopkins,
we're giving Psilocybin,
this is the ingredient in magic mushrooms.

41
00:02:43.581 --> 00:02:47.780
There were synthesizing it,
um,
to people who had cancer diagnoses,
people,

42
00:02:47.781 --> 00:02:51.950
very sick,
many of them terminal in the hopes that they would have a,

43
00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.150
what they call the mystical experience,

44
00:02:54.151 --> 00:02:58.430
a powerful spiritual experience that would change their attitude toward their

45
00:02:58.431 --> 00:03:03.100
death and help them essentially to die with more peace.
Um,

46
00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:06.620
they were,
these were all patients who are struggling with depression,

47
00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:10.780
anxiety and fear,
profound fear and the stories I,

48
00:03:10.781 --> 00:03:14.410
so I started writing about that because it seemed like the last thing I would

49
00:03:14.411 --> 00:03:19.210
want to do is trip when I was facing a terminal diagnosis to lose control.

50
00:03:19.211 --> 00:03:24.100
Like that.
And uh,
you would,
you would presumably have a very dark experience.

51
00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:29.020
Um,
so I started interviewing these people for a piece I did in the New Yorker in

52
00:03:29.021 --> 00:03:34.000
2015 and,
um,
just to give you one example,
to give you the flavor of it,

53
00:03:34.001 --> 00:03:37.260
I remember talking to this woman,
she was a,
um,

54
00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:42.250
a figure skating instructor and in New York,
in Manhattan,
she was about 60.

55
00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:43.610
She was not a psycho naut,

56
00:03:43.611 --> 00:03:48.611
she'd never used psychedelics before and she had ovarian cancer and her cancer

57
00:03:49.511 --> 00:03:53.950
had been treated successfully,
but she was paralyzed by the fear of recurrence.

58
00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:58.570
She just couldn't function cause she thought any day now this could be back.
Um,

59
00:03:58.571 --> 00:04:03.310
so she entered into this trial at Nyu and had a,

60
00:04:03.311 --> 00:04:07.120
um,
a high dose psilocybin experience.

61
00:04:07.121 --> 00:04:09.670
And I should explain how this is done because the image you may have in your

62
00:04:09.671 --> 00:04:12.610
head of taking second,
Alex,
uh,
you know,

63
00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:15.070
taking a handful of mushrooms and going to a concert or something.

64
00:04:15.071 --> 00:04:17.380
This is not how it is used in a clinical setting.

65
00:04:17.381 --> 00:04:21.780
It's a very controlled experience.
It's guided.
Um,
so you,

66
00:04:21.781 --> 00:04:24.850
you work with two guides,
a man and a woman,

67
00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:30.070
they prepare you over a course of several sessions as to what to expect.

68
00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:33.430
Um,
so they'll talk to you what to do if,
if,
if,

69
00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:36.950
if the experience becomes frightening,
which it often does.
A,

70
00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:40.030
and how to navigate that.
They call it the flight instructions and their,

71
00:04:40.031 --> 00:04:43.680
and their main advice is,
you know,
if you see a staircase go up.
It,

72
00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:48.160
if you see a door open it,
if you,
um,
if you see a monster,
don't run away,

73
00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:51.280
just step right up to and say,
what are you doing in my head?

74
00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:56.050
What do you have to teach me?
Um,
in other words,
surrender to the experience.

75
00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:00.250
Um,
uh,
trust,
relax.
They quote John Lennon,
uh,

76
00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:03.640
relax the mind and float downstream.
Um,

77
00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:05.500
and that's very important advice.

78
00:05:05.501 --> 00:05:08.620
And it's often the difference between a good trip and a bad trip.
Uh,

79
00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:12.460
a bad trip is essentially a panic reaction against what's happening in your
head,

80
00:05:12.461 --> 00:05:13.900
which is very heavy.
I mean,
you're,

81
00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:19.110
you're experiencing your ego dissolving in fact,
in front of you.
Um,

82
00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:23.650
and then they sit with you for the whole experience and they give you a helping

83
00:05:23.651 --> 00:05:25.710
hand if you're getting upset,
uh,

84
00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:28.660
are struggling and they take you to the bathroom and give you a glass of water.

85
00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:29.190
Uh,

86
00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:33.490
and then afterwards is a really key moment called the integration session where

87
00:05:33.491 --> 00:05:35.950
they,
um,
uh,
sit with you.

88
00:05:35.951 --> 00:05:39.340
You tell the story of your trip and it usually is this narrative.

89
00:05:39.341 --> 00:05:43.330
It's almost like this interest psychic movie where you go different places and

90
00:05:43.331 --> 00:05:46.660
you try to make sense of it and apply the lessons to your life.

91
00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:51.550
So in the case of this woman,
her name is Dina Baser,

92
00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:56.620
she,
um,
uh,
she had this trip and there are many elements I won't go into.
It was,

93
00:05:56.621 --> 00:05:58.460
it was like six hours.
Um,

94
00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:03.520
and she went into her body imaginatively and she saw this black mass under her

95
00:06:04.311 --> 00:06:06.500
rib cage.
And that was her fear.

96
00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:08.840
It wasn't her cancer cause that wasn't in the right place,

97
00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:14.170
but she saw what she realized was her fear and she screamed at her fear and you

98
00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:17.150
have to see this woman.
She's very timid,
small woman.
And she said,

99
00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:22.130
get the fuck out of my body.
And it did.
It disappeared.

100
00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:27.170
The black mask was gone.
And afterwards she said,

101
00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:31.850
I realized during that experience that I can't control my cancer,

102
00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:36.500
but I can control my fear.
And that distinction meant everything to her.

103
00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:41.660
And one of the hallmarks of the psychedelic experience is that whatever insights

104
00:06:41.661 --> 00:06:46.430
you have during it,
have a force.
The likes of which you've never experienced.

105
00:06:46.431 --> 00:06:49.790
These are not just opinions or insights,
they're revealed truths.

106
00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:51.320
This is something William James,

107
00:06:51.321 --> 00:06:55.760
a long time ago writing about the a mystical experience called the noetic since

108
00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:57.470
it's a very uncanny thing.

109
00:06:57.471 --> 00:07:01.340
And it's what allows people to change that if they,

110
00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:03.110
if they think,

111
00:07:03.111 --> 00:07:07.280
say they're trying to quit smoking and they have some epiphany that,
gee,

112
00:07:07.281 --> 00:07:10.640
my breadth is really precious,
I should not ruin it by smoking.

113
00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:14.420
Suddenly that'll be so strongly held as a belief that they can actually stop

114
00:07:14.421 --> 00:07:15.820
smoking.
So anyways,

115
00:07:15.821 --> 00:07:20.030
so that's the kind of experience that I was learning about and I became

116
00:07:20.031 --> 00:07:22.880
fascinated to understand the neuroscience behind it,

117
00:07:22.881 --> 00:07:26.600
what's going on in the brain when people are taking one of these trips.

118
00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:29.750
And we now know some interesting things about that.
If you're interested,

119
00:07:29.751 --> 00:07:32.030
I can talk about that.
And also the history of it.

120
00:07:32.031 --> 00:07:35.270
Like what happened the second deluxe in the 60s,

121
00:07:35.271 --> 00:07:39.830
that they became so stigmatized that,
um,

122
00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:41.030
research stopped.

123
00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:46.010
There had been a very productive period of research all through the 50s that was

124
00:07:46.011 --> 00:07:50.160
yielding really promising results in the treatment of alcoholism,
in,

125
00:07:50.210 --> 00:07:54.620
in dealing with people who are dying,
depression,
anxiety,
obsession.

126
00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:59.810
And then after this moral panic that hits the culture around 1965,

127
00:08:00.350 --> 00:08:04.520
um,
nobody studies it anymore.
Uh,
the funding dries up.

128
00:08:04.521 --> 00:08:07.460
Scientists are a little embarrassed by it.
And,
uh,

129
00:08:07.461 --> 00:08:12.461
and we had an unprecedented situation where a promising line of scientific

130
00:08:12.591 --> 00:08:16.880
investigation,
uh,
was stopped.
Um,
that never happens.

131
00:08:16.881 --> 00:08:20.540
And we lost 30,
35 years of research into psychedelics.

132
00:08:21.590 --> 00:08:24.680
Thankfully it's resuming.
And my book is very much about the renaissance.

133
00:08:24.681 --> 00:08:27.220
Even though I go back and look at the history and,
uh,

134
00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:30.710
figure out why we had this panic reaction about them,
uh,

135
00:08:31.190 --> 00:08:34.940
and try to look at them in a very matter of fact,
way as interesting tools,

136
00:08:35.030 --> 00:08:38.810
interesting tools for understanding the mind and for healing the mind.

137
00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:43.640
Now we haven't proven all this.
Um,
there's still more research to be done.
Um,

138
00:08:43.670 --> 00:08:47.630
we're kind of in phase two and there's face,
there are three phases to FDA,

139
00:08:47.631 --> 00:08:52.430
drug approval.
Um,
but so far the results have been remarkably encouraging.

140
00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:57.080
Um,
it is one of the most powerful psychiatric interventions that the researchers

141
00:08:57.090 --> 00:09:00.910
they've ever seen.
And we're in a situation where,
um,

142
00:09:00.990 --> 00:09:03.960
mental health care is so broken in this country.

143
00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:08.250
It's failing to reach half the people who need it.
Um,

144
00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:10.070
the last major innovation where the,

145
00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:13.620
where the SSRI antidepressants in the late eighties,

146
00:09:13.621 --> 00:09:17.370
there really hasn't been anything since then.
Um,
and,
uh,

147
00:09:17.371 --> 00:09:19.730
so we need some new ways of thinking.
And,

148
00:09:19.750 --> 00:09:24.540
and along comes this powerful old but new innovation and,
um,

149
00:09:25.110 --> 00:09:30.030
and the research is,
um,
you know,
it's being privately funded for the most part.

150
00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:31.620
Big Pharma is not interested in this.

151
00:09:31.621 --> 00:09:36.600
There's no intellectual property that you can control.
Um,
but a lot of,

152
00:09:36.930 --> 00:09:38.450
uh,
donors,

153
00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:41.910
many in the tech community actually have stepped up and are funding this

154
00:09:41.911 --> 00:09:45.480
research.
Uh,
and I was just at a fundraiser where,
you know,

155
00:09:45.630 --> 00:09:50.310
the last $7 million was raised and,
uh,
and so we will find out,

156
00:09:50.311 --> 00:09:53.110
we'll get the real test,
the scientific test of what,

157
00:09:53.130 --> 00:09:56.490
what are these drugs good for?
And then there's the question of what are they,

158
00:09:56.520 --> 00:09:59.540
what value might they have for the rest of us?
Um,

159
00:09:59.610 --> 00:10:03.450
because they help people who have serious problems.

160
00:10:03.451 --> 00:10:05.130
But as one researcher put it to me,

161
00:10:05.310 --> 00:10:09.810
they're very important for the betterment of well people.
Um,
and,
uh,

162
00:10:09.811 --> 00:10:12.390
and I can talk a little bit about that too.
So as part of this,

163
00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:16.110
because it's sort of my brand to do emersion journalism.
You know,

164
00:10:16.111 --> 00:10:20.490
when I wrote about the cattle industry,
I bought a steer when I,
um,

165
00:10:20.850 --> 00:10:24.060
uh,
when I wanted to learn about architecture,
I built a house.

166
00:10:24.061 --> 00:10:28.610
So of course I had to experiment and,
um,
and I,

167
00:10:28.611 --> 00:10:33.611
I found some guides underground and there is a thriving community of underground

168
00:10:33.751 --> 00:10:38.751
guides in America who could give me an experience very much like the ones at Nyu

169
00:10:39.630 --> 00:10:43.950
and Hopkins and,
and they were,
you know,
transformative experiences,
some of them,

170
00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:46.290
um,
some of the most meaningful experiences,

171
00:10:46.291 --> 00:10:50.700
my live life and the idea that a molecule could occasion that is,
um,

172
00:10:50.790 --> 00:10:52.260
to me still kind mind blowing.

173
00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:56.150
So I'm going to though I've given you lots of leads and things you might want to

174
00:10:56.160 --> 00:11:00.450
follow up on and uh,
I'm happy to talk about anything.
Um,

175
00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:03.510
I advise you not to talk about your own experiences.
Um,

176
00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:07.530
I want to welcome the Google microdosing club to today's event.

177
00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:14.640
Um,
anyway,
so yeah.
Question.

178
00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:21.420
<v 2>All right.
So,
uh,
I don't want to be the devil's advocate here,</v>

179
00:11:21.421 --> 00:11:25.290
but it's
this idea that we're going to,

180
00:11:25.350 --> 00:11:26.550
we're going to give somebody this drug,

181
00:11:26.551 --> 00:11:28.080
they're going to have this transformative experience.

182
00:11:28.081 --> 00:11:32.760
And then it's going to change them.
I understand how that makes sense to me,

183
00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:37.070
but the idea that that change would necessarily be for the better.
Yeah.

184
00:11:37.470 --> 00:11:40.830
That like person comes back from a trip and decides they're going to quit

185
00:11:40.831 --> 00:11:41.940
smoking.
That's great.

186
00:11:41.941 --> 00:11:45.420
But like why doesn't a person come back from a trip and decide they need to like

187
00:11:45.421 --> 00:11:50.010
killed her neighbor?
Like right.
What we're,
how do we break the cemetery there,

188
00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:51.730
set and set it.
So

189
00:11:52.630 --> 00:11:53.710
<v 0>one of the,
the,</v>

190
00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:59.070
one of the important features of second Elyx is how little the experiences for

191
00:11:59.841 --> 00:12:02.170
ordained are dictated by the drug itself.

192
00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:05.140
The drug is like an unspecific mental amplifier.

193
00:12:05.650 --> 00:12:10.330
And so your expectation and intention is very important to what happens.

194
00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:13.870
And one of the things that happens in the preparation is that the guide is

195
00:12:13.871 --> 00:12:16.780
helping you set an intention.
Like,
I want to quit smoking,

196
00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:19.660
I want to confront my mortality.
Um,

197
00:12:19.750 --> 00:12:24.100
and you will usually have an experience in that realm.

198
00:12:24.490 --> 00:12:28.270
Um,
because that's what you've been primed to have.
Um,

199
00:12:28.300 --> 00:12:31.720
could the drugs be used for evil?
Um,

200
00:12:32.350 --> 00:12:36.610
well we have the case of Charles Manson Manson.
Apparently.

201
00:12:36.611 --> 00:12:40.960
We don't know that all the details,
but used LSD on his little posse of,

202
00:12:41.410 --> 00:12:45.400
of,
uh,
what would become murderers,
um,
and they are,

203
00:12:45.430 --> 00:12:50.430
the drugs are incredibly suggestible and that you could imagine a charismatic

204
00:12:50.501 --> 00:12:51.670
figure using them that way.

205
00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:54.760
Then now that the CIA sought to use in that way to the CIA,

206
00:12:54.761 --> 00:12:57.340
had a very active research program in the 50s.

207
00:12:57.490 --> 00:13:01.030
The same time all this university work was going on in the 50s to help people.

208
00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:05.290
The CIA was trying to weaponize,
uh,
LSD and Psilocybin,

209
00:13:05.900 --> 00:13:10.330
and they thought they went through a series of different paradigms.
One was,
um,

210
00:13:10.990 --> 00:13:13.840
uh,
you would use it as a truth serum.
People would,
couldn't,

211
00:13:14.170 --> 00:13:17.410
could tell you the truth if you gave it to them in interrogation.

212
00:13:17.950 --> 00:13:21.820
People said crazy shit,
you know,
and it didn't work.
Uh,

213
00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:26.170
there was no truth in that.
And,
um,
uh,

214
00:13:26.171 --> 00:13:29.710
and then they thought,
well,
we could use it to,
uh,
have foreign leaders.

215
00:13:29.711 --> 00:13:32.860
We can dose them and they would do embarrassing things that might work,

216
00:13:32.890 --> 00:13:35.170
I don't know.
And we don't know how far they got with it.

217
00:13:35.171 --> 00:13:37.540
And then the other one was his mind control,
right?

218
00:13:37.660 --> 00:13:42.520
That you could use this drug to control people's minds.
As far as we know,

219
00:13:42.521 --> 00:13:46.390
that didn't work either,
but we don't know for sure.
Um,
uh,

220
00:13:46.391 --> 00:13:48.280
and we shouldn't put too much by them.

221
00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:53.110
So I think it all depends on your therapist and how the,

222
00:13:53.140 --> 00:13:54.850
how the situation is.

223
00:13:55.060 --> 00:14:00.060
People don't generally go have violent episodes after psychedelics in general.

224
00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:06.370
The experience tends to be one where you discover that love is the most

225
00:14:06.371 --> 00:14:10.750
important thing in the universe and this hallmark card platitudes suddenly

226
00:14:10.751 --> 00:14:15.640
becomes this profundity and,
um,
and it is a profundity,

227
00:14:15.641 --> 00:14:19.420
but we've heard it so many times that it's been now there's an interesting line

228
00:14:19.421 --> 00:14:23.770
between the Banal and the profound and psychedelics definitely works on that

229
00:14:23.771 --> 00:14:25.720
line.
So,
um,

230
00:14:26.470 --> 00:14:30.610
I think we should be mindful of that possibility.
But I,
I don't think,

231
00:14:30.670 --> 00:14:32.320
we certainly haven't seen anything like that.

232
00:14:32.321 --> 00:14:36.550
There've been a thousand dosings of volunteers since this next,

233
00:14:36.551 --> 00:14:40.630
this new wave of research and there has not been a single adverse event.
Uh,

234
00:14:40.631 --> 00:14:45.430
no psychotic breaks,
uh,
no jumping out of windows.
Um,
but there,

235
00:14:45.790 --> 00:14:49.060
there's no question that people can do stupid things on psychedelics as they can

236
00:14:49.061 --> 00:14:52.840
on alcohol and,
and any number of drugs.
So thanks very much.
You.

237
00:14:56.130 --> 00:14:56.963
<v 3>Woo.</v>

238
00:14:57.440 --> 00:15:02.390
<v 0>Do you have any theories of why our brains are wired to react to things from</v>

239
00:15:02.391 --> 00:15:03.590
plants and some guy?

240
00:15:03.620 --> 00:15:08.300
And are there any things when the animal came to that do the same thing?
Well,

241
00:15:08.301 --> 00:15:13.130
animals do,
uh,
like plant drugs also.
I mean,
we,
we have many cases of,
I mean,

242
00:15:13.131 --> 00:15:16.190
if you've had a cat and never given them cat nap,
um,
no,
no,

243
00:15:16.191 --> 00:15:20.970
I meant like any venoms that,
uh,
oh yeah.
One of the second Alex I,
I,

244
00:15:20.971 --> 00:15:24.650
I'm experimented with is something called five Meo DMT.

245
00:15:24.970 --> 00:15:29.650
This is a pretty obscure Psychedelic,
I see a couple nods in the crowd,
um,
that,

246
00:15:32.100 --> 00:15:34.810
um,
that,
uh,

247
00:15:34.820 --> 00:15:38.240
is the smoked venom of the Sonoran desert toad.

248
00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:44.180
Somebody figured that out,
right?
I mean,
what a species.
Huh?
Um,

249
00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:48.130
uh,
so,
um,
but you're the,

250
00:15:48.190 --> 00:15:50.840
but why are we wired for,
this is a really interesting question.

251
00:15:50.841 --> 00:15:55.280
So the way the drugs appear to work in the mind,
um,

252
00:15:55.490 --> 00:15:57.120
is that they,
they,

253
00:15:57.121 --> 00:16:01.430
they bind to your serotonin at one particular serotonin receptor that's very

254
00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:05.090
common in the cortex and they start a cascade of effects.

255
00:16:05.090 --> 00:16:06.020
That's what neuroscience is.

256
00:16:06.090 --> 00:16:10.910
And they really don't know what's happening for a while.
And,
um,
um,
but that,

257
00:16:10.911 --> 00:16:15.911
that in turn eventually downregulate something called the default mode network

258
00:16:16.820 --> 00:16:20.780
when they,
I'll tell you what that is cause it's very important actually.
And um,

259
00:16:20.781 --> 00:16:21.950
and it explains a lot.

260
00:16:22.100 --> 00:16:26.540
So when they first started doing fmri imaging of people's brains on

261
00:16:26.541 --> 00:16:27.201
psychedelics,

262
00:16:27.201 --> 00:16:30.710
they would basically inject you with psilocybin and slide you into the MRI

263
00:16:30.711 --> 00:16:35.210
machine and you'd have what could be a very scary experience.
And um,

264
00:16:35.900 --> 00:16:39.170
and then they took these pictures and they expected to see lots of extra

265
00:16:39.171 --> 00:16:43.270
activity because there's such fireworks in the experience.
Um,
but they,

266
00:16:43.271 --> 00:16:45.440
they were very surprised to find that in fact,

267
00:16:45.441 --> 00:16:48.110
this particular network went quiet.

268
00:16:48.620 --> 00:16:52.670
And this is a network that's very active when you're not on task.
Okay.

269
00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:56.300
It's in a CSR relationship with the attentional networks when you're like

270
00:16:56.301 --> 00:16:57.650
working or something like that.

271
00:16:58.070 --> 00:17:01.550
But when you're asked to just lie back in an MRI machine and they're trying to

272
00:17:01.551 --> 00:17:05.960
get a baseline,
this lights up and they were like,
why is that?
What is it doing?

273
00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:09.890
Well,
this appears to be the part of your brain that is active.

274
00:17:09.891 --> 00:17:11.450
When you're mind wandering,

275
00:17:11.900 --> 00:17:16.130
when you're ruminating or worrying or reflecting on yourself,

276
00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:20.150
it's a center of self reflection.
It's also involved in time travel,

277
00:17:20.151 --> 00:17:23.510
the ability to think about the future or the past.

278
00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:27.040
And it's involved in theory of mind.
This is the,
uh,

279
00:17:27.080 --> 00:17:31.310
this is the term for the ability to think about the mental states of other

280
00:17:31.311 --> 00:17:35.510
people,
central to compassionate and imagination and things like that.
And lastly,

281
00:17:35.511 --> 00:17:38.810
it's involved in something called the,
um,
uh,

282
00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:41.360
the narrative self or experiential self.

283
00:17:41.361 --> 00:17:45.400
And this is kind of where you knit together what happens to you,
uh,

284
00:17:45.410 --> 00:17:50.100
at any given moment with the story of who you are,
uh,

285
00:17:50.130 --> 00:17:52.410
based on who you've been and who you want to be.

286
00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:57.800
And it's kind of where we sustain that story that our sense of self depends on,

287
00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:02.810
um,
and so this network,
um,

288
00:18:02.850 --> 00:18:06.860
so if the ego has an address,
it's in the default mode network.
This is,

289
00:18:06.930 --> 00:18:08.730
this is what the research shows.

290
00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:13.380
It's really interesting that this is what gets down regulated,
uh,

291
00:18:13.381 --> 00:18:14.970
during the experience and,
and it,

292
00:18:15.020 --> 00:18:18.180
and it chimes with the experience of ego dissolution.

293
00:18:18.181 --> 00:18:20.370
People report on a high dose experience.

294
00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:25.700
I had an experience on a guided silicide been trip where I felt my sense of self

295
00:18:26.041 --> 00:18:27.330
scattered to the wind,

296
00:18:27.331 --> 00:18:31.560
like a blizzard of post its and then I looked out and I don't know what,

297
00:18:31.561 --> 00:18:33.150
who's the eye he was looking out at this.

298
00:18:33.151 --> 00:18:38.151
I mean there was a split in consciousness where I could watch myself then get

299
00:18:38.850 --> 00:18:43.470
spread over the landscape,
like a coat of paint out there and I was fine with it.

300
00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:45.380
This other self was fine with it.
Um,

301
00:18:45.450 --> 00:18:50.160
and it was this kind of very unperturbed double consciousness that could be hold

302
00:18:50.161 --> 00:18:50.671
this thing.

303
00:18:50.671 --> 00:18:55.350
And I realized I'm not identical to my ego and what was going.

304
00:18:55.351 --> 00:18:59.970
And that's a very important insight,
um,
to acquire I think,
and very useful.
Um,

305
00:19:00.210 --> 00:19:04.680
but what was going on in my brain was the default mode network was going offline

306
00:19:04.681 --> 00:19:05.760
for a period of time.

307
00:19:06.150 --> 00:19:09.840
The sense of self dissolves and then something else happens,

308
00:19:09.841 --> 00:19:11.730
which is other networks in the brain,

309
00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:14.670
which normally would only communicate through this hub,

310
00:19:15.180 --> 00:19:16.770
start talking directly to each other.

311
00:19:16.771 --> 00:19:20.730
And there's a map in the book of the brain on us on a placebo and the brain on

312
00:19:20.731 --> 00:19:25.000
psilocybin.
And one looks like the route map of American Airlines and the other,

313
00:19:25.001 --> 00:19:28.230
it looks like the route map of some like little commuter line that you know,

314
00:19:28.231 --> 00:19:32.640
and it goes to 10 places.
And um,
uh,
so new connections form.

315
00:19:32.820 --> 00:19:37.160
And what are those new connections?
I mean,
that's the interesting question,
uh,

316
00:19:37.230 --> 00:19:38.880
is that your,
uh,

317
00:19:38.910 --> 00:19:42.570
say your hippocampus talking to your visual cortex and so you start having

318
00:19:42.571 --> 00:19:47.080
images of things that you,
that you fear or desire.
Um,

319
00:19:47.210 --> 00:19:51.860
is it the basis of hallucination or is it perhaps the basis of a new metaphor or

320
00:19:51.870 --> 00:19:54.630
new insight or new meme?
Um,
we don't know yet.

321
00:19:54.631 --> 00:19:57.890
That's the next step is to really understand that.
So,
um,

322
00:19:57.990 --> 00:19:59.970
these are temporary changes in the brain.

323
00:19:59.971 --> 00:20:03.480
Eventually your ego kind of reconsolidate.
Um,

324
00:20:03.510 --> 00:20:08.510
but having had a glimpse of that other way to the whole experience is very

325
00:20:09.541 --> 00:20:14.160
powerful.
Uh,
and in my integration session,
I said to Mary,
who is my guide?
I said,

326
00:20:14.161 --> 00:20:18.000
well,
okay,
I've had this amazing experience of ego dissolution.

327
00:20:18.030 --> 00:20:22.110
And I realized I'm not identical to my ego.
I can have a little distance on it.

328
00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:27.780
But I said,
my ego is back in uniform and on patrol.
What?
So what good is that?

329
00:20:27.781 --> 00:20:31.310
And she said,
well,
basically you've had a taste of another way to react to,

330
00:20:31.380 --> 00:20:35.160
to life.
A little less defensive,
a little less trigger happy,

331
00:20:35.161 --> 00:20:37.470
and you can cultivate that.
And I said,
how?

332
00:20:37.471 --> 00:20:41.610
And she said through meditation and Meditation is kind of how you keep alive,

333
00:20:41.611 --> 00:20:45.030
the psychedelic experience.
It makes you a very good meditator.
Um,

334
00:20:45.090 --> 00:20:47.590
although I know you're not supposed to say good or bad meditator,

335
00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:54.010
but,
um,
being trapped in that language.
Um,
so that's,

336
00:20:54.011 --> 00:20:55.240
that's kind of a,
you know,

337
00:20:55.250 --> 00:20:59.350
real shorthand of what we understand about the neuroscience.
The,
the,
the,

338
00:20:59.380 --> 00:21:03.340
the neuroscientific investigation of this phenomena is absolutely fascinating.

339
00:21:03.341 --> 00:21:07.330
And for me,
that chapter of the book was,
um,
you know,
the,
the most challenging,

340
00:21:07.331 --> 00:21:08.650
right?
Well,
not the most challenging,

341
00:21:08.651 --> 00:21:11.350
but one of the most challenging and fascinating to learn about.

342
00:21:11.740 --> 00:21:13.210
So thanks for your question.
Thank you.

343
00:21:15.930 --> 00:21:20.370
<v 4>Hi.
Um,
I,
so I have heard,
uh,
reverse that amongst,</v>

344
00:21:20.371 --> 00:21:25.230
have been able to achieve if somewhere thing to a psychedelic trip.

345
00:21:25.710 --> 00:21:30.480
Um,
do you know anything about what that entails or if it's like,

346
00:21:30.481 --> 00:21:31.860
if there's any research that

347
00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:35.840
<v 0>yes,
to it being a strong,
or it's,
I mean,</v>

348
00:21:35.841 --> 00:21:40.340
there's anecdotal research is really interesting.
So one very relevant fact.

349
00:21:40.790 --> 00:21:41.750
At the same time,

350
00:21:41.751 --> 00:21:45.500
we were doing this imaging work on Psilocybin in the human brain and there was

351
00:21:45.501 --> 00:21:48.040
another researcher at Yale,
uh,

352
00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:50.990
imaging the brains of very experienced meditators,

353
00:21:50.991 --> 00:21:55.400
people who attend thousand hours of meditation experience and they would go into

354
00:21:55.401 --> 00:21:59.780
the Fmr Ri and meditate and their brains looked identical.

355
00:22:00.350 --> 00:22:04.010
They also had this suppression of the default mode network.

356
00:22:04.460 --> 00:22:08.840
And of course that is the state of kind of selflessness that people report

357
00:22:09.470 --> 00:22:13.130
coming out of meditation.
In terms of the monks.
Um,

358
00:22:13.160 --> 00:22:16.280
these are people with really long experience meditation,

359
00:22:16.330 --> 00:22:18.590
a meditation and that they can almost,

360
00:22:18.591 --> 00:22:23.420
it will probably quiet the default mode network.
There's a famous story about,
um,

361
00:22:23.660 --> 00:22:26.900
Ron Doss,
Richard Alpert,
who was Timothy Leary's,

362
00:22:27.190 --> 00:22:31.610
a collaborator and went during the Harvard psilocybin project in the early

363
00:22:31.610 --> 00:22:35.280
sixties.
He,
this guy went on to become,
uh,

364
00:22:35.530 --> 00:22:37.820
a guru basically,
and he's still alive.

365
00:22:37.821 --> 00:22:42.740
He's in Hawaii and he was very interested in psychedelics and then found Hindu

366
00:22:42.741 --> 00:22:47.741
religion and he went to India and he told his guru about lsds and his,

367
00:22:47.820 --> 00:22:50.570
and his guru said,
um,
I want to try it.

368
00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:53.180
I want to see what happens cause you're telling me you're reaching this

369
00:22:53.181 --> 00:22:57.170
spiritual plane on this drug.
And that's my,
that's my territory.

370
00:22:57.560 --> 00:23:00.290
And um,
so,
uh,

371
00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:03.860
Ron doss apparently gave him 600 micrograms of Lsd,

372
00:23:03.861 --> 00:23:06.680
which is a beyond heroic dose.

373
00:23:07.850 --> 00:23:12.720
And that's what the guy wanted.
He said,
give me as much as you have.
And,
and the,

374
00:23:12.890 --> 00:23:17.570
the monk or whatever he is,
he's a guru.
I guess takes it and nothing happened.

375
00:23:20.270 --> 00:23:22.310
Is this true?
I mean it's,
you know,

376
00:23:22.340 --> 00:23:25.670
Ron does tells the story in and swears that it's true,
but,
um,

377
00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:30.710
but it goes to your point,
there are other ways to achieve the same effect.

378
00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:35.630
Um,
psychedelics are probably a shortcut to becoming a really good meditator,

379
00:23:35.631 --> 00:23:40.130
but my guess is we will find at some point that all the disciplines,

380
00:23:40.131 --> 00:23:44.750
the spiritual disciplines that share this sense of,
uh,

381
00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:48.110
of transcending the ego,
um,

382
00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:52.550
are doing the same thing in the brain.
Um,
that that is where that's happening.

383
00:23:52.820 --> 00:23:56.600
And I'm thinking of sensory deprivation.
You know,
if you get into these tanks,

384
00:23:56.630 --> 00:23:58.700
sensory deprivation tanks,
they're sort of coming back.

385
00:23:58.701 --> 00:24:01.460
There were a thing in the 60s,
um,
uh,

386
00:24:01.490 --> 00:24:06.040
or fasting or prayer or the right kind of music and,

387
00:24:06.041 --> 00:24:10.700
and breathing exercises.
One of the psychedelic trips I had involved,
no drugs,

388
00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:13.480
something called holotropic breathwork.
It's,

389
00:24:13.550 --> 00:24:18.050
it's based on a yogic breathing exercise where you essentially hyperventilate

390
00:24:18.070 --> 00:24:21.020
you,
you breathe really fast,
you exhale more than,

391
00:24:21.021 --> 00:24:25.190
than you inhale and you enter a trance state.
It's,

392
00:24:25.191 --> 00:24:27.200
it's the most uncanny thing.

393
00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:32.060
And my guess is that hyperventilation is starving the default mode network of

394
00:24:32.061 --> 00:24:35.750
oxygen,
um,
and reducing the activity there.

395
00:24:35.751 --> 00:24:38.810
So this is all areas to be explored.

396
00:24:38.811 --> 00:24:41.830
We may find other ways to achieve the same thing.
Um,

397
00:24:41.870 --> 00:24:42.920
but I think it's all connected.

398
00:24:43.590 --> 00:24:47.400
<v 2>Thank you so much.
Thank you.
Hi.
Hi.</v>

399
00:24:47.700 --> 00:24:51.600
One of the interesting trends that I've read about blogs and whatnot is the rise

400
00:24:51.601 --> 00:24:53.890
of microdosing time.
For those who don't know,

401
00:24:53.900 --> 00:24:57.510
a microdosing is taking small doses of psychedelics,

402
00:24:57.570 --> 00:24:59.670
a somewhat regular basis,
a smoke,

403
00:24:59.700 --> 00:25:04.250
far too small to actually caused any sort of trip and proponents of microdosing

404
00:25:04.260 --> 00:25:08.100
claim that it can help with things such as depression and anxiety,
improved mood,

405
00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:09.450
improved creativity.

406
00:25:09.780 --> 00:25:12.930
I'm wondering if you got a chance to investigate microdosing at all in your book

407
00:25:12.990 --> 00:25:17.190
and if you get a sense that some of the renewed research interest for high dose

408
00:25:17.191 --> 00:25:21.060
experience might carry over into researching whether microdosing is clinically

409
00:25:21.061 --> 00:25:22.110
significant or not.

410
00:25:22.330 --> 00:25:23.700
<v 0>Excellent question.
Um,</v>

411
00:25:24.040 --> 00:25:28.510
so microdosing is a very interesting phenomenon.
As the questioner said,

412
00:25:28.511 --> 00:25:33.250
it's taking a sub perceptual dose with often with LSD about 10 micrograms every

413
00:25:33.251 --> 00:25:34.330
third or fourth day.

414
00:25:34.840 --> 00:25:37.660
And the reason you don't take it every day is because it would lose its effect.

415
00:25:37.750 --> 00:25:42.040
Um,
the drugs kind of cancel themselves out at a certain point.
Um,

416
00:25:42.580 --> 00:25:46.090
many people anecdotally report a success with this,

417
00:25:46.091 --> 00:25:48.970
that it's kind of a brain tonic and it,
and it does help with depression.

418
00:25:48.971 --> 00:25:52.480
There's a wonderful book written about it if you want to follow up by Ayelet

419
00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:57.130
Waldman called a really good day and she's someone who struggled with depression

420
00:25:57.160 --> 00:26:00.280
and uh,
for many years and found more relief on,

421
00:26:00.310 --> 00:26:02.140
on this regime of microdosing then,

422
00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:05.830
and she's been through the whole Pharmacopeia,
I'm sure.
Um,

423
00:26:06.850 --> 00:26:10.630
the reason I don't spend a lot of time on it and the book is that there isn't

424
00:26:10.631 --> 00:26:15.040
yet anything beyond the anecdotal reports.
They're interesting.

425
00:26:15.041 --> 00:26:19.630
They're really provocative,
uh,
and they're being systematically connected.

426
00:26:19.631 --> 00:26:20.381
If you go online,

427
00:26:20.381 --> 00:26:23.680
there's a guy named James Fadiman who was one of the first generation

428
00:26:23.681 --> 00:26:28.460
researchers whose advising people on the protocol and soliciting reports and

429
00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:31.060
getting this interesting data set,

430
00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:34.420
but it has not been trialed the way these,

431
00:26:34.450 --> 00:26:39.160
the large dose silicide Manhasset.
I hear that these trials are about to happen.

432
00:26:39.161 --> 00:26:43.180
And so we may get some really solid information on whether microdosing works.

433
00:26:43.830 --> 00:26:48.450
The fact is though there is such a strong placebo effect with psychedelics,

434
00:26:48.540 --> 00:26:53.340
um,
there's so suggestible then it's very easy to see how it would work.

435
00:26:53.450 --> 00:26:53.790
Um,

436
00:26:53.790 --> 00:26:58.080
just the very idea that you're taking a small dose of Lsd probably would have an

437
00:26:58.081 --> 00:27:02.580
effect.
Um,
but is it a pharmacological effect or a placebo effect?

438
00:27:02.610 --> 00:27:06.870
That's what we remains to be learned.
Um,
so,
you know,
I'm,

439
00:27:06.910 --> 00:27:08.880
I'm skeptical about it.
Uh,
I,

440
00:27:08.881 --> 00:27:13.860
I do want the research to happen and this interest in,
in macro dosing,

441
00:27:13.861 --> 00:27:17.550
if you will,
is has stimulated people to fund some research,

442
00:27:17.790 --> 00:27:21.030
some of which will be underground,
some of which will be above ground.

443
00:27:21.420 --> 00:27:24.810
So I'm very excited to see what they come up with.
Thanks.
Thank you.

444
00:27:27.420 --> 00:27:28.320
Thanks for being here.
Today.

445
00:27:29.220 --> 00:27:33.180
Wasn't pretty famously said that LSD was one of the things that differentiated

446
00:27:33.181 --> 00:27:37.020
apple from Microsoft and Johnson that too.
Yeah.

447
00:27:37.060 --> 00:27:41.880
And at this organization,
uh,
we selected,
oh,
apocryphally Eric Schmidt,
the CEO,

448
00:27:41.881 --> 00:27:46.410
because he was,
the candidate had been to burning man as an external observer.

449
00:27:46.411 --> 00:27:47.040
I'm curious,

450
00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:50.340
what are your observations about the intersection between psychedelics and,

451
00:27:50.341 --> 00:27:52.620
and the technology or the tech industry?

452
00:27:53.230 --> 00:27:57.720
It's a really interesting relationship.
Um,
so Steve jobs famously said too,

453
00:27:57.721 --> 00:28:00.210
it had been formative to his intellectual development and,

454
00:28:00.211 --> 00:28:01.050
and I thought it was him,

455
00:28:01.051 --> 00:28:04.500
but maybe it was Wazniak who said that a windows would have been a much better

456
00:28:04.501 --> 00:28:09.210
product,
had gates,
uh,
ever taken LSD.
It was like a really mean thing to say.

457
00:28:09.211 --> 00:28:12.770
I think the gates and gates immediately said,
but I did,
but I did,

458
00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:18.540
but it didn't work.
It must not have been enough.
Um,
so,
um,

459
00:28:19.080 --> 00:28:23.400
and I thought this was the beginning of the tech community's interest in these

460
00:28:23.401 --> 00:28:27.270
drugs.
And because it's very current,
I mean,
you know better than I,
but I mean,

461
00:28:27.271 --> 00:28:30.450
I've talked to lots of people in Silicon Valley and it's a big part of the

462
00:28:30.451 --> 00:28:34.110
culture right now.
Microdosing macro dosing.
There's,
I mean,

463
00:28:34.111 --> 00:28:38.610
I know one prominent tech company that uses it and their management training,

464
00:28:38.730 --> 00:28:43.200
um,
you know,
LSD.
Um,
so it's,
there's a lot of,

465
00:28:43.320 --> 00:28:48.000
you know,
a lot of interest there.
And,
and,
and it is the tech community,

466
00:28:48.001 --> 00:28:50.940
as I said,
this funding a lot of this research.
Um,

467
00:28:51.450 --> 00:28:53.650
but it turns out that,
um,

468
00:28:54.180 --> 00:28:59.180
engineers had been interested in Lsd back in the fifties and that there's this

469
00:29:00.001 --> 00:29:04.650
very interesting episode before Timothy leary and the whole 60 psychedelic story

470
00:29:04.651 --> 00:29:09.630
that we think we know so well.
There was this research period and,
um,

471
00:29:09.690 --> 00:29:13.200
there was this very interesting character who's kind of a counterpart to leary

472
00:29:13.210 --> 00:29:16.830
named Al Hubbard.
And I tell his story in the book,
he's very mysterious figure.

473
00:29:16.831 --> 00:29:21.180
He's got,
he's involved with the oss,
which became the CIA.

474
00:29:21.181 --> 00:29:24.390
He's playing both sides of many worlds.
Um,

475
00:29:24.450 --> 00:29:29.450
but he had a vision in 1951 that told him he could be involved in a major

476
00:29:31.261 --> 00:29:36.200
civilization change.
He realized it was LSD.
He went to Sandoz were,

477
00:29:36.210 --> 00:29:38.100
uh,
which own the patent on it.

478
00:29:38.130 --> 00:29:42.280
It was a Swiss pharmaceutical company persuaded them to give him something like

479
00:29:42.310 --> 00:29:44.470
a liter bottle of LSD,

480
00:29:44.920 --> 00:29:49.920
which probably is enough to trip a third of the population of earth at that

481
00:29:50.741 --> 00:29:52.900
point.
Uh,
I mean,
just an incredible amount,

482
00:29:53.290 --> 00:29:56.590
which he keeps buried in death valley at his place.
And anyway,

483
00:29:56.591 --> 00:30:00.130
he's a great character.
He's so much more interesting than Larry.
So He's,

484
00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:04.450
he becomes the Johnny Appleseed of LSD and,
but he's got a different theory.

485
00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:08.560
He said he was at kind of a conservative guy.
He wanted to turn on the elite,

486
00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:13.150
so he was going to do captains of industry,
uh,
you know,

487
00:30:13.151 --> 00:30:17.830
engineers,
artists,
um,
and people in the church,
the Catholic Church.

488
00:30:18.220 --> 00:30:21.250
And he would go around with a Satchel tripping people,
members,
legal.

489
00:30:21.251 --> 00:30:24.910
It was legal then.
And,
and he became,
and it became a very gifted guide,

490
00:30:25.300 --> 00:30:30.300
so he has his eye on the tech world as one of the places where you could have

491
00:30:31.181 --> 00:30:32.320
this multiplier effect.

492
00:30:32.620 --> 00:30:37.620
So he turns on a couple engineers who are working at a company called Ampax,

493
00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:42.040
which is actually one of the first silicon valley companies in the 50s.

494
00:30:42.220 --> 00:30:45.040
They make magnetic tape on,
which as you know,

495
00:30:45.041 --> 00:30:48.460
all computer information was stored,
but also video and sound recording.

496
00:30:49.330 --> 00:30:54.160
He had 40,000 people in the valley before it was called Silicon Valley.
And,
um,

497
00:30:55.060 --> 00:30:58.110
and the head of strategic planning,
he turned on and another guy,

498
00:30:58.111 --> 00:31:01.780
and actually Ampex for awhile was going to be the world's first psychedelic

499
00:31:01.781 --> 00:31:04.600
company.
And,
um,
but the,
uh,

500
00:31:04.601 --> 00:31:08.350
the president was Jewish and Al Hubbard was Catholic and he kept bringing in

501
00:31:08.351 --> 00:31:13.090
crucifixes and things and the,
and the president said,
go ahead.
And,

502
00:31:13.120 --> 00:31:14.970
uh,
so,
but anyway,

503
00:31:14.971 --> 00:31:19.971
so these engineers though were so taken with this experience that they left the

504
00:31:20.381 --> 00:31:25.000
company,
a group of three or four engineers and started a big research,
uh,

505
00:31:25.030 --> 00:31:29.500
something called the International Foundation for advanced research.

506
00:31:29.890 --> 00:31:33.430
And they were doing a lot of psychedelic research.

507
00:31:33.431 --> 00:31:37.120
And I've always been interested in as to why engineers in particular had such a

508
00:31:37.121 --> 00:31:40.150
strong reaction to this drug.
And I talked to,

509
00:31:40.510 --> 00:31:42.300
I talked to a couple of engineers about it and Wa,

510
00:31:42.370 --> 00:31:46.690
and you can tell me if this chimes with your sense of things,
but this guy,

511
00:31:46.720 --> 00:31:49.390
this one guy in particular told me that,
um,
oh,

512
00:31:49.391 --> 00:31:53.410
and the are some of the early chip designers.
We're into lst.

513
00:31:53.440 --> 00:31:56.440
It's very hard to design a chip without a computer.
But of course,

514
00:31:56.500 --> 00:31:57.490
at the beginning you had to,

515
00:31:57.940 --> 00:32:01.580
and you could hold this complex three d structure in your head,
uh,

516
00:32:01.640 --> 00:32:06.190
with the help of,
uh,
the drug.
And this guy said,
oh,

517
00:32:06.191 --> 00:32:07.180
and one of the,
sorry,

518
00:32:07.181 --> 00:32:10.450
one of the early people at the International Foundation for advanced study who

519
00:32:10.451 --> 00:32:13.690
was tripped was someone you probably know if you know your history of your

520
00:32:13.691 --> 00:32:18.280
industry,
but a Doug Angle,
Bart,
right?
Who invented,

521
00:32:18.310 --> 00:32:22.900
you know,
the mouse and the interface and email.
And like everything,
right?

522
00:32:22.901 --> 00:32:24.850
There was this mother of all demos.
Well,

523
00:32:24.851 --> 00:32:29.851
that guy got LSD from those Ampex guise and under the influence they were doing

524
00:32:31.411 --> 00:32:35.860
on creativity study,
he invented something.
Then it wasn't that profound.

525
00:32:35.861 --> 00:32:40.670
It was something he called a tingle toy to teat to toilet train boys and was

526
00:32:40.671 --> 00:32:43.720
something you could like aim a stream of urine and it would make sure things

527
00:32:43.721 --> 00:32:47.920
happen.
Okay.
It's not quite the,
you know,

528
00:32:49.270 --> 00:32:54.120
the mouse,
but it was pretty cool.
But prime the pump,
you know.
Uh,

529
00:32:54.700 --> 00:32:58.470
so anyway,
where was I?
So,
um,
this,

530
00:32:58.471 --> 00:33:00.030
this engineer I was talking to said,
well,

531
00:33:00.031 --> 00:33:03.180
the problem if you're an engineer as opposed to a scientist,
scientists can,

532
00:33:03.210 --> 00:33:07.530
like their goal is to reduce problems to the simplest terms.

533
00:33:07.800 --> 00:33:12.570
But engineers are faced with an irreducible complexity and number of variables.

534
00:33:12.750 --> 00:33:14.280
So the challenge is different.

535
00:33:14.281 --> 00:33:18.900
The challenge becomes finding pattern and psychedelics,

536
00:33:18.901 --> 00:33:22.200
one of the things that happens is you find pattern where you didn't see it

537
00:33:22.201 --> 00:33:23.670
before.
Um,

538
00:33:23.700 --> 00:33:28.700
and that he thought was why so many engineers found this a useful tool.

539
00:33:29.340 --> 00:33:31.740
I think that's fascinating.
I think there's John Mark,

540
00:33:31.741 --> 00:33:36.741
I'm wrote an interesting history about silicon valley and the 60s,

541
00:33:36.871 --> 00:33:38.410
and he,
and there's some very good stuff on,

542
00:33:38.870 --> 00:33:43.200
on drugs and he interviewed jobs about his experience.
But um,

543
00:33:43.770 --> 00:33:48.000
uh,
yeah,
it's part of the tradition.
You're your end.
Thank you.

544
00:33:48.330 --> 00:33:49.163
You're welcome.

545
00:33:50.580 --> 00:33:51.810
<v 4>Hi.
Hi.
Um,</v>

546
00:33:51.811 --> 00:33:55.470
so you talked a little bit about how like every culture in the world has

547
00:33:55.471 --> 00:33:58.560
experienced this to some degree or is integrated into their,
their culture.

548
00:33:58.561 --> 00:34:01.650
And I'm curious from a sort of anthropological perspective,

549
00:34:01.651 --> 00:34:06.060
cause I imagine there's a huge range and the way that,
that these drugs are,

550
00:34:06.090 --> 00:34:07.200
are applied,
right?

551
00:34:07.201 --> 00:34:11.010
It's a select few or it's open to everyone or it's ritualistic or it's ordinary

552
00:34:11.011 --> 00:34:15.400
or whatever.
Are there other sort of cultural patterns that can be yeah,

553
00:34:15.660 --> 00:34:18.750
to do store associated and um,
you know,
from,

554
00:34:18.780 --> 00:34:21.640
from the drug use within those coffees?
Good question.
I actually,
yeah,
we

555
00:34:21.660 --> 00:34:24.780
<v 0>think we have a lot to learn from the traditional use of these drugs.</v>

556
00:34:24.900 --> 00:34:27.840
So we're going to stay on psychedelics.
And um,

557
00:34:28.230 --> 00:34:31.140
there are lots of plant drugs that are not that controversial like caffeine,

558
00:34:31.170 --> 00:34:35.400
although in some cultures they might be.
Um,
but psychedelics have been used for,

559
00:34:35.460 --> 00:34:40.020
it looks like several thousand years.
It appears that the ancient Greeks,

560
00:34:40.100 --> 00:34:40.933
um,

561
00:34:40.950 --> 00:34:45.570
all the writers you've heard of participating in an annual ritual that involved,

562
00:34:45.980 --> 00:34:49.740
uh,
what,
what seems to be a psychedelic,
it's called,
it was called the Kiki on a,

563
00:34:49.741 --> 00:34:54.660
it was an annual,
right,
uh,
in honor of diameter harvest related.
Uh,

564
00:34:54.661 --> 00:34:59.340
it was called the the l e l e l e,
U s Eleusinian mysteries.

565
00:34:59.760 --> 00:35:01.740
And everybody was sworn to secrecy about this.

566
00:35:01.741 --> 00:35:03.150
So we don't know that much about it.

567
00:35:03.151 --> 00:35:07.320
But everybody took this potion and went to the underworld,

568
00:35:07.350 --> 00:35:10.590
had experiences of a beyond and it was very profound.
And,

569
00:35:10.860 --> 00:35:13.890
and it was the only time you were ever allowed to take this drug.

570
00:35:13.891 --> 00:35:16.590
We don't know what the drug was.
Um,
and in fact,

571
00:35:16.650 --> 00:35:21.420
one person was caught using the drug at like a party and you know,
it was,

572
00:35:21.470 --> 00:35:25.890
you know,
imprisoned or killed or something.
And it was,
it was a big crime.
Um,

573
00:35:27.180 --> 00:35:27.901
the lesson,

574
00:35:27.901 --> 00:35:32.310
I think the takeaway from lots of traditional cultures use is that they

575
00:35:32.311 --> 00:35:36.300
recognize that these were very powerful medicines,

576
00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:38.850
not to treated casually,

577
00:35:39.420 --> 00:35:43.500
and that they all surrounded the use of their plant medicine,

578
00:35:43.501 --> 00:35:47.250
as they often call it with ritual ceremony,

579
00:35:47.460 --> 00:35:51.780
elders in attendance.
Um,
it was never careless.

580
00:35:51.840 --> 00:35:56.310
It was never casual.
It was never a recreational.
It was a profound experience.

581
00:35:56.730 --> 00:36:01.410
And I think when the drugs hit the west beginning and the 50,

582
00:36:01.411 --> 00:36:06.360
late fifties,
early sixties,
we didn't have any container for them.
You know,

583
00:36:06.361 --> 00:36:07.740
we didn't have rituals.

584
00:36:07.740 --> 00:36:11.760
We just kind of like took a handful of mushrooms and went to a concert or we

585
00:36:11.761 --> 00:36:15.810
drank LSD from the punchbowl.
Uh,
and um,

586
00:36:15.840 --> 00:36:18.960
and I think that's why some people really got in trouble.
Um,

587
00:36:19.410 --> 00:36:22.410
and so that the lesson that we failed to learn was that yes,

588
00:36:22.411 --> 00:36:26.010
these drugs have an ancient lineage,
but look how they were used.

589
00:36:26.011 --> 00:36:30.750
Look at what those cultures learn by trial and error,
um,
of,
you know,

590
00:36:30.751 --> 00:36:35.050
and now we see it in shamanic ceremonies in South America.
Um,

591
00:36:35.220 --> 00:36:38.370
there were mushroom cults in Mexico that went back.
We don't know how long,

592
00:36:38.371 --> 00:36:43.020
but at least a thousand years.
Um,
but they were always taken in a group,

593
00:36:43.400 --> 00:36:48.380
uh,
with guidance with someone who wasn't taking the drugs.
Um,
and,
uh,

594
00:36:48.390 --> 00:36:50.310
with enormous care.

595
00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:54.060
And I think that's what we lost and we need to now invent that container for

596
00:36:54.061 --> 00:36:58.230
ourselves.
Maybe it's this therapeutic protocol I'm describing.
I'm not sure,

597
00:36:58.530 --> 00:37:00.540
but that's the cultural work that needs to be done.

598
00:37:01.040 --> 00:37:05.480
<v 2>So thank you.
Sure.
Hi.</v>

599
00:37:06.630 --> 00:37:11.630
I was wondering whether in your research you'd come across the video of a debate

600
00:37:14.250 --> 00:37:18.870
from 1967 between Timothy leary and Jerome.

601
00:37:18.880 --> 00:37:21.000
Left at Mit?
No.

602
00:37:21.030 --> 00:37:25.590
Jerome Let Ben [inaudible] for those who don't know who that recognize the name.

603
00:37:25.650 --> 00:37:28.890
Jerome weapon was one of the pioneers of neuroscience.

604
00:37:29.220 --> 00:37:34.220
It was one of the four authors of one of the first papers on the physiology of

605
00:37:36.451 --> 00:37:40.320
perception title,
what the frogs I tells the frog's brain.

606
00:37:41.250 --> 00:37:42.270
And uh,

607
00:37:42.450 --> 00:37:47.450
he was also one of the most charismatic professors at MIT in the 1960s and they

608
00:37:47.641 --> 00:37:49.620
held this debate,
uh,

609
00:37:49.650 --> 00:37:54.650
sometime in 1967 and leary went first and he had the whole audience loled and to

610
00:37:58.741 --> 00:38:02.070
going along,
he was very charismatic and uh,

611
00:38:02.160 --> 00:38:04.470
let them got up and said bullshit.

612
00:38:04.770 --> 00:38:08.790
I think it may have been the first time bullshit was allowed to be set on

613
00:38:08.791 --> 00:38:12.630
broadcast television.
Um,
anyway,

614
00:38:12.730 --> 00:38:13.800
uh,

615
00:38:13.830 --> 00:38:18.830
let funds may biggest argument against taking LSD was the phenomenon of

616
00:38:21.121 --> 00:38:25.320
uncontrolled flashbacks and how that could get people in trouble.

617
00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:30.330
But,
uh,
as I was standing in line here,
I looked it up and it's on youtube.

618
00:38:30.660 --> 00:38:34.530
Uh,
the,
the whole thing actually ran about two hours.

619
00:38:34.810 --> 00:38:35.890
Wgbh,

620
00:38:35.891 --> 00:38:40.891
public TV station recorded and broadcasted it at one hour edited version.

621
00:38:42.461 --> 00:38:46.780
But I led an l e t.
V.
I.
N?
Yes.
Okay.
Maybe,
maybe two,

622
00:38:47.320 --> 00:38:52.030
one or two teeth.
Well,
this is a good occasion to talk about risk.
Um,
so let me,

623
00:38:52.420 --> 00:38:57.020
unless you want to frame the question,
but I'd love to,
I just have a,

624
00:38:57.040 --> 00:39:00.700
I'll let you talk about it,
but I just wanted to ask one more question.

625
00:39:01.210 --> 00:39:06.130
When you talk about food,
you almost always bring a bag of groceries.

626
00:39:06.590 --> 00:39:07.423
<v 0>Oh yes.</v>

627
00:39:12.890 --> 00:39:14.960
Let me tell you a little tutorial on the law.

628
00:39:18.050 --> 00:39:19.790
So,
um,
I,
you know,

629
00:39:19.791 --> 00:39:23.090
I was a very nervous Nelly doing these experiences.

630
00:39:23.091 --> 00:39:27.200
I didn't have a lot of experience with psychedelics in college and,
um,

631
00:39:27.620 --> 00:39:30.110
and even after I was really too afraid to take these drugs,

632
00:39:30.111 --> 00:39:33.230
I didn't think I was psychologically sturdy enough at that point in my life.

633
00:39:33.680 --> 00:39:37.460
And so,
before I dove in for this project,

634
00:39:37.461 --> 00:39:42.290
I did a lot of research,
um,
as I'm want to do as a journalist to figure out,

635
00:39:42.291 --> 00:39:44.200
well,
how,
what are the dangers?
Because there,

636
00:39:44.420 --> 00:39:46.550
there are lots of stories you heard in the 60s,
you know,

637
00:39:46.551 --> 00:39:49.910
people staring at the sun to live and go blind.
That was one story,

638
00:39:50.240 --> 00:39:52.790
a scrambling of your chromosomes.

639
00:39:52.820 --> 00:39:55.610
Both those stories by the way were one was made up,

640
00:39:55.611 --> 00:39:59.150
the first was made up and that's been proven and the chromosome story was

641
00:39:59.151 --> 00:40:03.620
withdrawn within months.
It was just really bad research.
Um,

642
00:40:03.680 --> 00:40:06.110
psychotic breaks.
Um,
and that did happen.

643
00:40:06.111 --> 00:40:08.740
Sometimes there are people at risk for schizophrenia that,

644
00:40:08.741 --> 00:40:12.800
that an acid trip was what tripped them off.
Um,

645
00:40:13.040 --> 00:40:15.980
but a lot of what was,
well let me divide it into two.

646
00:40:15.981 --> 00:40:19.160
There's physiological risk and there's psychological risks.
Okay.

647
00:40:19.880 --> 00:40:23.570
I'm the physiological side.
It's stunning how,

648
00:40:25.220 --> 00:40:27.840
I don't want to overstate this,
but that how,
uh,

649
00:40:27.860 --> 00:40:31.400
compared to other drugs that we take routinely,
how nontoxic,

650
00:40:31.910 --> 00:40:36.470
relatively nontoxic classic psychedelics are.
Um,
and I'm talking about LSD,

651
00:40:36.471 --> 00:40:40.900
psilocybin DMT,
um,
Mescalin.
Um,
they are,

652
00:40:40.901 --> 00:40:42.950
there is no known lethal dose,

653
00:40:43.460 --> 00:40:48.460
which you can't say about over the counter drugs you take for a cold or from

654
00:40:48.651 --> 00:40:52.670
pain.
Um,
uh,
there are very few molecules in your brain.

655
00:40:52.671 --> 00:40:57.350
They're washed out really quickly and they don't seem to affect the,
um,
you know,

656
00:40:57.380 --> 00:41:00.060
they affect your brain and they don't affect other parts of,

657
00:41:00.070 --> 00:41:02.120
if you have a panic attack,
your blood pressure's going to go up.

658
00:41:02.120 --> 00:41:06.110
But they don't directly affect other systems.
That's one thing.

659
00:41:06.140 --> 00:41:08.960
And they're also non addictive.
Um,
they're,

660
00:41:08.961 --> 00:41:12.560
the first thought you have upon finishing a psychedelic trip is like,

661
00:41:12.590 --> 00:41:16.370
when can I do that again?
It's actually,
do I ever have to do that again?
Um,

662
00:41:16.670 --> 00:41:20.540
and because it's really intense and they're so,
they're not habit forming.

663
00:41:20.541 --> 00:41:22.630
If you give the rat set,
you know,
with the,

664
00:41:22.631 --> 00:41:26.870
in that experiment with the rat has two levers and one's cocaine and one's food,

665
00:41:26.871 --> 00:41:28.310
and if you press it,
deliver,

666
00:41:28.490 --> 00:41:32.090
he gets a dose of cocaine and they'll press until they die over and over and

667
00:41:32.091 --> 00:41:35.410
over again.
Um,
you put LSD in that contraption,

668
00:41:35.411 --> 00:41:39.140
we'll press it once and never again.
Um,
I mean,

669
00:41:39.141 --> 00:41:43.640
imagine being a rat on Lsd.
So,

670
00:41:43.730 --> 00:41:47.330
so from a,
from your,
from the physiological point of view,

671
00:41:47.390 --> 00:41:51.260
they're safer than a lot of drugs we take routinely.
Um,

672
00:41:52.040 --> 00:41:56.030
and I was surprised to learn that frankly,
um,
psychologically,
you know,

673
00:41:56.031 --> 00:42:00.530
it's very hard to sort through the stories,
the flashback phenomenon,
which,

674
00:42:00.560 --> 00:42:03.110
which I've heard reported.
Um,

675
00:42:03.130 --> 00:42:06.470
I have never found any really good research on it.
Um,

676
00:42:06.740 --> 00:42:09.530
and I'm still looking for it.
If anybody has a good paper on that,

677
00:42:09.531 --> 00:42:13.760
I'd love to see it.
Um,
there are,
you know,
I've had,

678
00:42:13.761 --> 00:42:17.870
I've kind of flashed on things that happened in my experience because they're

679
00:42:17.871 --> 00:42:22.420
part of my store of psychic,
powerful psychic memories.
Um,

680
00:42:22.430 --> 00:42:26.630
is that a flashback?
I don't think so cause I can get it out of my head.
Um,

681
00:42:26.660 --> 00:42:30.980
but there are people who have these unbidden uh,

682
00:42:31.010 --> 00:42:33.680
moments of consciousness that are,
that you know,

683
00:42:33.681 --> 00:42:36.440
may be connected to what happened to them.
Um,

684
00:42:36.470 --> 00:42:41.470
I haven't heard that they interfere with people's life or mental health.

685
00:42:41.750 --> 00:42:44.870
Um,
but it's,
it's a,
it's a question mark.
Um,

686
00:42:45.200 --> 00:42:49.220
the great danger is the danger you have drinking too much also,

687
00:42:49.221 --> 00:42:53.810
which is doing stupid things,
uh,
walking into traffic falling.
Um,

688
00:42:53.870 --> 00:42:57.660
all that happens on psychedelics as it happens with any powerful drug and they,

689
00:42:57.661 --> 00:42:59.750
they,
it,
that's why a guide is really important.

690
00:42:59.751 --> 00:43:03.800
So I'm going to look out for your body in the con in the studies that have gone

691
00:43:03.801 --> 00:43:04.131
on,

692
00:43:04.131 --> 00:43:08.960
there have now been a thousand dosings of people who have been screened for

693
00:43:08.961 --> 00:43:11.660
mental health problems and things like that.
Um,

694
00:43:11.690 --> 00:43:15.920
and there has not been a single serious adverse event.
Um,

695
00:43:15.950 --> 00:43:20.030
so are there adverse events when people use the drugs?
Recreational?
Yes.

696
00:43:20.031 --> 00:43:23.210
We all know people who've had really bad trips and they usually stop using it at

697
00:43:23.211 --> 00:43:28.130
that point.
Um,
felt trapped,
had panic reactions,
but often,

698
00:43:28.220 --> 00:43:30.140
um,
psychiatrists would,

699
00:43:30.320 --> 00:43:35.320
who didn't know this territory would misinterpret a panic reaction as a

700
00:43:36.051 --> 00:43:39.440
psychotic break because it sure looks like that you're having delusions,

701
00:43:39.441 --> 00:43:43.520
you're hearing voices,
you know,
I mean,
to an average psychiatrist,

702
00:43:43.580 --> 00:43:46.610
this would say psychosis,
but often it was a panic attack.

703
00:43:46.940 --> 00:43:50.900
I interviewed Andrew Weil,
Dr Andrew Weil about this.
Um,

704
00:43:50.990 --> 00:43:53.480
and he was very interested in psychedelics in the 60s.

705
00:43:53.481 --> 00:43:56.050
He was at Harvard and leary was there.
And,
uh,

706
00:43:56.060 --> 00:43:58.790
when he graduated from medical school in 1968,
he,

707
00:43:58.791 --> 00:44:03.050
he went out to San Francisco and volunteered at the Haight Ashbury free clinic.

708
00:44:03.530 --> 00:44:08.480
Uh,
and they were seeing lots of LSD casualties,
as they call it.
People coming in,

709
00:44:08.481 --> 00:44:11.570
having bad trips,
thinking they're losing their mind or they're dying.

710
00:44:12.140 --> 00:44:15.950
And he knew the territory really well,
having used a lot of psychedelics.

711
00:44:15.951 --> 00:44:18.770
And he would come into the little cubicle was somebody who was completely

712
00:44:18.771 --> 00:44:20.810
freaking out.
And,
uh,

713
00:44:20.811 --> 00:44:23.810
he had on his white coat and stethoscope and his clipboard,

714
00:44:23.811 --> 00:44:27.140
and he'd ask a few questions and then he'd say,
the person,
we,
excuse me,

715
00:44:27.141 --> 00:44:30.620
there's someone in the next room is really in trouble.
And he lead.

716
00:44:30.680 --> 00:44:33.090
And they were like,
wow,
someone's more fucked up than I am.

717
00:44:33.690 --> 00:44:38.410
And they would suddenly feel fine.
It was just completely subsided.

718
00:44:38.850 --> 00:44:43.620
So suggestibility is a very big part of the experience.

719
00:44:44.120 --> 00:44:44.953
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

721
