1
00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:10.870
I am very excited to introduce you to Simone.
Yatch.

2
00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.220
Her name's spelled differently,
but that's how you pronounce it.

3
00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:19.740
A Simone is Sweden born and a descendant of Erickson founder Lars Magnus

4
00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:20.641
Ericsson.
Oh,
cool.

5
00:00:20.641 --> 00:00:24.180
Is that someone describes herself as the queen of shitty robots,

6
00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.470
breaker of transistors,
mistress of malfunction,
mother.

7
00:00:28.471 --> 00:00:30.030
I'm terrible interventions.
However,

8
00:00:30.031 --> 00:00:34.500
I really prefer inventor tainer coined by Rediker supposedly.

9
00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:35.100
Uh,

10
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.600
she explored engineering physics in college before finding her true calling on

11
00:00:39.601 --> 00:00:44.160
youtube.
I'm not sure why,
but her family calls her pim.
Uh,

12
00:00:44.161 --> 00:00:48.660
you can check out someones terribly brilliant creations on her youtube channel

13
00:00:48.661 --> 00:00:50.520
Googlers.
Please welcome Simone to Google.

14
00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.940
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

15
00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:00.970
<v 0>yeah,
I think that this is the first time that I've heard that youtube is my true</v>

16
00:01:00.971 --> 00:01:05.740
calling.
All it is.
At least for now,
it's legitimate,

17
00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:10.720
but I'm just like,
have I said that
I know?
Yeah,
sure.

18
00:01:10.721 --> 00:01:15.370
Yeah.
Youtube is my true calling the youtube team.
Yeah.
Clapping while,
uh,

19
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.920
crimes,
all emotional.

20
00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:20.680
<v 2>So for four before talking about shitty robots,</v>

21
00:01:20.681 --> 00:01:25.681
I'm completely jealous about your recent vomit comet trip that you a clue it on

22
00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.200
youtube channel is party verace.
Dot Training.
Uh,

23
00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.140
describe how it works and what I'm most interested in is what it's like that

24
00:01:32.141 --> 00:01:34.720
moment you become weightless.

25
00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:37.480
<v 0>So a little bit of background story.</v>

26
00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:41.440
I took a month long break from shimmy robots because I really want to go to

27
00:01:41.441 --> 00:01:46.060
space.
I'm a wonder a hundred 100% serious about it.
And uh,

28
00:01:46.061 --> 00:01:49.180
I actually got funding from Google to do it from Google's making and science

29
00:01:49.181 --> 00:01:50.080
team.
So thanks for that.

30
00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:54.520
But I got to go on the vomit comet zero g flight on the,

31
00:01:54.521 --> 00:01:56.910
on the last episode.
So basically it's this airplane,

32
00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.220
the Dus parabolas so it goes up and down really fast so you get to experience

33
00:02:00.221 --> 00:02:04.300
what it's like to be weightless.
And it was,
I was,

34
00:02:04.301 --> 00:02:06.850
so first of all I had to pee really badly,

35
00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.650
which like took cause you're like both worried about vomiting and about peeing

36
00:02:11.651 --> 00:02:15.460
at the same time.
So it was a lot of body fluids to keep on track.
You know,

37
00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.070
I feel like 25% of my brain power went to that.

38
00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:21.580
But it was the craziest feeling cause you're,

39
00:02:21.581 --> 00:02:26.080
you're laying down on the floor and first you experienced an increased amount of

40
00:02:26.081 --> 00:02:30.040
g forces because you're accelerating and then you just get lighter and lighter

41
00:02:30.041 --> 00:02:34.270
and it feels exactly as if you pictured like meditating,

42
00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:38.440
you'd start levitating cause you just like very slowly float up.

43
00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:43.920
And it actually made me really sad because while it felt like the wildest and

44
00:02:45.821 --> 00:02:49.690
weirdest thing I'd ever experienced,
it also felt so natural.

45
00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:53.020
Cause I was like,
yeah,
of course this is something that humans do.

46
00:02:53.021 --> 00:02:54.430
And I think like,
I mean everybody,

47
00:02:54.431 --> 00:02:58.240
every human being dreams about flying and what it's like to be flying.

48
00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:01.480
And it was like,
yeah,
this is,
yeah,
this is what I'm made for.

49
00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:03.970
And then you get back to gravity and you were like,
no,

50
00:03:03.971 --> 00:03:07.520
I'm like bound to this big like dirt ball gravity.

51
00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:10.960
Any gravity is the biggest Downer on planet earth.

52
00:03:10.961 --> 00:03:12.940
The Yard I've used such as before.
Yeah,

53
00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:15.230
<v 2>we got to work on no growth and no gravity team.</v>

54
00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.330
It's gotta be one on Google somewhere.
Uh,

55
00:03:17.331 --> 00:03:22.130
so you talked your way into a job as a professional maker for a startup in the

56
00:03:22.131 --> 00:03:22.910
bay area.

57
00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:27.680
How hard was it to Waco walk away from basically a real job and find your way to

58
00:03:27.681 --> 00:03:30.530
make a living on your own where you constantly convincing your friends and

59
00:03:30.531 --> 00:03:32.600
family that it wasn't a huge mistake.

60
00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:35.310
<v 0>So who was it that was not the way it happened?</v>

61
00:03:35.311 --> 00:03:38.580
It was more because I did have a great job.
So I started learning.
I didn't,

62
00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:41.550
I dropped out of college after a year,
so I started studying physics,

63
00:03:41.551 --> 00:03:45.600
but I dropped out because I just felt it was a little bit too dry.
And um,

64
00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:49.260
I really wanted to learn about electronics because I saw all these like

65
00:03:49.261 --> 00:03:51.600
different DIY projects that people were building and I thought that they were

66
00:03:51.601 --> 00:03:53.850
super cool and I remember being like,

67
00:03:53.851 --> 00:03:57.180
should I go back to school for it or should I try and learn by my own?

68
00:03:57.181 --> 00:03:59.010
And what I decided on was like,
no,

69
00:03:59.011 --> 00:04:02.730
I should try and get a job in the field so I can get paid to learn about it.

70
00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:03.930
So I got a job at,

71
00:04:03.931 --> 00:04:08.220
as a maker in residence at a company that makes a microcontroller or an Arduino

72
00:04:08.221 --> 00:04:12.840
board called the light blue bean and they were here in the bay area and it was

73
00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:15.480
really great.
Like the job was super fun,

74
00:04:15.481 --> 00:04:19.020
but I just wasn't very enthusiastic about it.

75
00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:24.230
And I decided to quit because I realized that I'd like,

76
00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:25.980
I've tried a lot of different things,

77
00:04:25.981 --> 00:04:28.440
I've had a lot of different jobs and it was like,

78
00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:32.300
it's like trying on different pairs of pants and you're like,
ah,

79
00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:33.690
these pants kind of work.

80
00:04:33.691 --> 00:04:36.510
But they are like crawling up my buddle it a bit or these ones are a little bit

81
00:04:36.511 --> 00:04:40.900
too sure.
And you're just like trying on all these different jobs and work,
uh,

82
00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:43.350
to see what fits you.
And that was like,
yeah,
it's like right,

83
00:04:43.351 --> 00:04:46.230
I love what I'm doing,
but it's like the setting of it doesn't really work.

84
00:04:46.231 --> 00:04:50.340
So it was actually that I quit my job not knowing what I was going to do and I

85
00:04:50.341 --> 00:04:54.180
decided to move back to Sweden and to like cut back on all of my costs.

86
00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:58.770
So I moved back with my mom.
I lived on like half a gigabyte of data every month,

87
00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:02.580
you know?
Yeah,
it was rough.
But all of those just,

88
00:05:02.581 --> 00:05:06.750
and I try to work as little as I had just to make a living just so I could free

89
00:05:06.751 --> 00:05:10.560
up a lot of time spending to spend on whatever I wanted and to pursue,

90
00:05:10.561 --> 00:05:15.561
like what I was enthusiastic about and from that platform or from that time that

91
00:05:16.621 --> 00:05:20.820
I freed up was where I started building these shitty robots.
So it wasn't,
I mean,

92
00:05:20.821 --> 00:05:22.410
yeah,
maybe it was the way you said it,

93
00:05:22.411 --> 00:05:25.770
but my parents have always been very supportive and were like,
yeah,

94
00:05:25.771 --> 00:05:28.770
do whatever you want.
It'll be fine.
Um,

95
00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:31.500
I think it's more been my brother and my brother was like,

96
00:05:31.501 --> 00:05:33.270
I remember him at some point being like,
Simone,

97
00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:38.580
he calls me the walking life crisis.
He's like,

98
00:05:38.581 --> 00:05:40.260
Simone,
if you're ever going to do something great,

99
00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:43.860
you have to like settle down on like what you're going to do or like choose a

100
00:05:43.861 --> 00:05:48.360
field and like go for it and spend more than a year on it.
Um,

101
00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:51.690
but I think it was,
yeah,
actually it wasn't that hard of a decision.

102
00:05:51.691 --> 00:05:54.520
It would have been harder to stay.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.

103
00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:56.090
<v 2>So you mentioned you don't have an engineering degree,</v>

104
00:05:56.091 --> 00:05:59.060
but you've got creative experiment and build stuff,

105
00:05:59.061 --> 00:06:02.630
which sounds like engineering to me and probably a lot of people in the room.
Uh,

106
00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:04.370
a maker for sure.

107
00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:09.140
Do you see yourself in any way as a role model and stereotype buster for girls

108
00:06:09.141 --> 00:06:09.630
interested in

109
00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:13.160
<v 0>tech?
No,
I struggle with that one.
Uh,</v>

110
00:06:13.161 --> 00:06:18.161
in part I often get the question if I see myself as a role model for girls and

111
00:06:19.111 --> 00:06:21.740
in some way like what I hear is,
and think,

112
00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:26.770
I think there's like something inherently wrong with it because it's like people

113
00:06:26.911 --> 00:06:31.911
have this perspective that as a woman you can only be a role model for girls.

114
00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:34.920
And people are always like,
you're such a great role model for girls.

115
00:06:34.921 --> 00:06:39.360
And I think actually it's just as important for men to have female role models

116
00:06:39.361 --> 00:06:42.180
as for girls to have female role models.
So,
I mean,

117
00:06:42.181 --> 00:06:46.470
and I mean that's aside from me probably not being a great role model in many

118
00:06:46.471 --> 00:06:47.304
ways,

119
00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:51.650
but I'm like telling myself that people can cherry pick the good parts and

120
00:06:51.651 --> 00:06:56.190
you're like exclude the bad parts.
Um,
but I mean I hope,
I mean to me it was also,

121
00:06:56.191 --> 00:06:58.620
I mean it was,
it was really important to see other,

122
00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:03.000
it does get like stronger when you see another woman or somebody and you can

123
00:07:03.001 --> 00:07:05.820
identify a little bit more with doing the thing that you want to do.

124
00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:09.330
And it wasn't until I saw a woman giving a talk on hardware hacking that I was

125
00:07:09.331 --> 00:07:13.740
like,
oh boy,
like if she can do it,
I can do it too.
Because you realize,

126
00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:16.740
because I was always interested in building things and making things,

127
00:07:16.741 --> 00:07:19.770
but I never saw myself as somebody being interested in technology and

128
00:07:19.771 --> 00:07:21.720
electronics.
And I think that's just like,

129
00:07:21.721 --> 00:07:24.210
because you've been brought up with the stereotype of like,
oh,

130
00:07:24.211 --> 00:07:27.810
this is the type of person that wouldn't be interested in it.
And,
uh,

131
00:07:27.811 --> 00:07:31.950
it takes seeing somebody who you can identify yourself with to be like,
wait,

132
00:07:31.951 --> 00:07:35.070
this,
like this is all just bullshit.
It doesn't make sense.
Yeah.

133
00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:38.910
<v 2>So what's the first,
a lot of people go down an engineering or make her path.</v>

134
00:07:38.911 --> 00:07:41.280
They've taken something apart that they probably weren't supposed to or they

135
00:07:41.281 --> 00:07:43.590
built something.
So what's the first thing you took apart?

136
00:07:43.591 --> 00:07:45.270
What's the first thing you built?
Do you remember?

137
00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:52.900
<v 0>I just about to take this mic apart.
Um,
I,</v>

138
00:07:53.530 --> 00:07:58.120
the first thing I remember and it kind of cool project,
we had this like old,

139
00:07:58.210 --> 00:08:03.130
um,
what's it called in English like this,
uh,
like,
uh,
well,

140
00:08:03.131 --> 00:08:05.960
you know,
when you're getting television,
you know,
television,

141
00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:10.840
satellite dish,
like the big like parabola.

142
00:08:10.870 --> 00:08:13.400
They were like the big thing you had on your house,
those white.
Yeah.

143
00:08:13.401 --> 00:08:16.120
So we had one of those in that we were going to throw away and I was like,

144
00:08:16.190 --> 00:08:20.110
I looks cool.
And I turned it into a chair when I was like nine.

145
00:08:20.170 --> 00:08:22.960
So I like built up,
it was the most uncomfortable chair.

146
00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:27.850
You kind of like you can,
you kind of like slid out of it?

147
00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:30.610
Cause it's like very like just around.

148
00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:34.900
So I bought like a little podium undergrad.
Um,
I think that was the first,

149
00:08:34.901 --> 00:08:35.501
but I did also,

150
00:08:35.501 --> 00:08:40.300
I remember I attempted to build a robot when I was like seven or eight and I had

151
00:08:40.301 --> 00:08:43.840
this grand idea of what this robot would be,
but all I got to wise,

152
00:08:43.841 --> 00:08:48.110
I got a block of wood and I drilled a hole through the wood and I put a stick

153
00:08:48.111 --> 00:08:51.940
through the hall and it was a robot because of your wiggled one end of the
stick,

154
00:08:51.941 --> 00:08:54.610
the other end would move too.
And I was like,
yeah,
I just felt a robot.

155
00:08:54.611 --> 00:08:56.940
It wasn't that,
what are we talking about?
Like whatever.

156
00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:03.570
<v 2>So you know,
um,
yeah.
What's been the response been to toy hauler,</v>

157
00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:07.910
toy hackers,
this partnership,
you have a golden locks.
And how'd that come about?

158
00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:11.810
<v 0>Um,
so I,
to me it's like a constant,</v>

159
00:09:12.230 --> 00:09:16.490
a lot of people think that I'm doing like kids content because like if you just

160
00:09:16.491 --> 00:09:20.480
see the,
the,
the little videos of,
of,
of my projects,
it looks like,

161
00:09:20.481 --> 00:09:23.020
I mean it looks like it's something for kids,
but then

162
00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:27.700
I'm just not very kid friendly and my sense of humor.

163
00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:30.190
So I've been trying and I like constantly hub.

164
00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:35.080
I'm surrounded by disappointed parents all the time cause they're like,

165
00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:37.330
I just really want to be able to show this to my son,

166
00:09:37.331 --> 00:09:41.930
but I can't cause you keep dropping the f bomb and the bomb and the bomb and the

167
00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:46.510
all the bombs.
No,
I did not say that.
Oh my God.
Well pretty much,

168
00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:51.550
yeah.
Pretty much.
Yeah.
No.
Yeah.
Um,
but yeah,

169
00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:53.920
so I'm trying to find ways in which I can like,

170
00:09:55.730 --> 00:09:56.260
<v 3>okay.</v>

171
00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:59.320
<v 0>Give kids good content to watch her watch my videos.
So I've been,</v>

172
00:09:59.350 --> 00:10:00.810
I've been collaborating with Goldieblox,

173
00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:03.340
which is this toy company that has like a female heroine.

174
00:10:03.660 --> 00:10:05.380
This is really cool inventor.

175
00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:09.820
And we did a Tory hacker series and they're also going to roll out,
um,

176
00:10:09.850 --> 00:10:13.630
censored versions of my videos.
So like kid friendly versions.

177
00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:18.250
So yeah,
which I'm really excited about.
So there would be kid friendly versions,

178
00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:21.250
uh,
living on their channel so I can just be like,
hey,
parents,

179
00:10:21.251 --> 00:10:26.150
don't be upset with me.
I've done,
I've done my part of it.
Um,
but yeah,
no,
it's,

180
00:10:26.180 --> 00:10:29.170
it's actually really nice because as much as like my content isn't that kid

181
00:10:29.171 --> 00:10:34.060
friendly,
it's when you have like 10 year olds,
right.
You and be like,
Hey,

182
00:10:34.061 --> 00:10:38.620
I built this thing inspired by this thing.
You Dad that like,
you're like,

183
00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:41.820
I'm so good.
I just see it.

184
00:10:42.550 --> 00:10:46.300
So you just get emotional from feeling so great about yourself.

185
00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:51.130
<v 2>So,
um,
you kind of mentioned this with your brother.</v>

186
00:10:51.131 --> 00:10:55.360
I'm not sure how you could plan for the success you've found online is having a

187
00:10:55.361 --> 00:11:00.130
master pan plan for your life or even the weekend coming up.
Totally overrated.

188
00:11:01.250 --> 00:11:03.890
<v 0>I mean,
it really depends.
So when I was younger,</v>

189
00:11:03.891 --> 00:11:08.010
I always had like five year plans.
I was like the Russian economy.
Like,

190
00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:11.960
this is what I'm going to do in the next five years.
And then it never happens.

191
00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:15.380
Um,
so now I'm more,

192
00:11:15.410 --> 00:11:19.820
I mean I think it's like I tried to not have a plan so I've been doing this for

193
00:11:19.821 --> 00:11:22.190
one and a half years.
It's been happening in pretty quickly.

194
00:11:22.191 --> 00:11:25.280
It was one and a half years ago since I published my first shitty robot.

195
00:11:25.790 --> 00:11:30.790
And I realized that like when you kind of get dragged into to to this like high

196
00:11:33.141 --> 00:11:34.910
paced thing,

197
00:11:34.940 --> 00:11:38.450
it's like hard because everybody wants you to have a plan and I'm trying to,

198
00:11:38.451 --> 00:11:40.820
cause it really started with something that I did just because I was

199
00:11:40.821 --> 00:11:44.510
enthusiastic about it and I'm trying not to have a plan because I feel that as

200
00:11:44.511 --> 00:11:46.670
soon as I have that and I'm like,
I'm going to do this,

201
00:11:46.671 --> 00:11:48.230
this is like the true trajectory.

202
00:11:48.740 --> 00:11:51.530
I feel like I'm going to kill my enthusiasm and that's just going to kill it

203
00:11:51.531 --> 00:11:53.740
itself.
But I do,
it's,

204
00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:58.670
I mean I have longterm goals like going into space and I also want to go into

205
00:11:58.690 --> 00:12:03.250
deep sea submarine that's covering like the whole spectrum.
Yeah.
That's coming.

206
00:12:03.251 --> 00:12:07.780
Yeah.
So it's like really low and really high and um,
yeah,

207
00:12:07.781 --> 00:12:11.770
but I try not to like limit myself to it,
but I mean it all depends on what you,

208
00:12:12.010 --> 00:12:13.100
I mean I,
I,

209
00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:17.620
I freak out whenever I feel that I'm like coroner it into something.

210
00:12:17.621 --> 00:12:19.210
So I think if I were like,

211
00:12:19.211 --> 00:12:21.370
this is what I'm going to do and I'm going to walk myself into it.

212
00:12:21.371 --> 00:12:25.150
I mean I've been really like trying to not lock myself into any contracts or

213
00:12:25.151 --> 00:12:28.120
anything like that because I just want to keep on reminding myself that like if

214
00:12:28.121 --> 00:12:32.290
I wake up tomorrow being like,
I never want to put out another video,
that's okay.

215
00:12:32.670 --> 00:12:33.870
<v 2>I think you should have youtube channels,</v>

216
00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:37.770
involuntary space travel where you just take random people and you put them up

217
00:12:37.771 --> 00:12:40.500
in their face and see what happens.
Anyway.
All right.

218
00:12:40.501 --> 00:12:44.080
So like I'm just popped into my head.
Uh,

219
00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:47.970
so like many youtube creators is a blur between your personal life and your,

220
00:12:47.971 --> 00:12:49.410
your youtube persona.

221
00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:54.780
I'm thinking in particular of your hilarious battle with the septic system of

222
00:12:54.781 --> 00:12:59.530
your houseboat,
which is so funny.
You know,
I've seen it if you want to see true.

223
00:13:03.950 --> 00:13:07.590
Um,
how do you protect your privacy?
Are you totally given up?

224
00:13:08.650 --> 00:13:10.810
<v 0>I think it's,
I mean,
for one it's like</v>

225
00:13:12.850 --> 00:13:17.140
I just try to remind people that like in real life,
as much as I feel,

226
00:13:17.141 --> 00:13:20.560
I mean I'm not like acting like somebody else on my youtube channel,

227
00:13:20.561 --> 00:13:24.220
but you're like a watered down version of the youtube because like when you're,

228
00:13:24.221 --> 00:13:26.170
when you're doing a video,
you're basically like,

229
00:13:26.171 --> 00:13:28.900
you have like 45 minutes of footage and you like,

230
00:13:29.170 --> 00:13:33.250
you just like cut it out and like Polish like this little diamond and turn it

231
00:13:33.251 --> 00:13:34.480
into like a four minute video.

232
00:13:34.780 --> 00:13:38.890
So in real life you're just like more boring version of that,
you know?

233
00:13:39.370 --> 00:13:42.520
Um,
but I think it's,
I mean it's hard cause it's like,

234
00:13:42.850 --> 00:13:44.860
it's definitely a different type of,

235
00:13:44.861 --> 00:13:49.090
my mom's a TV host and back in Sweden where I'm from and she's been a TV host

236
00:13:49.091 --> 00:13:54.091
for last 20 years and it's like a very different type of celebrity,

237
00:13:54.630 --> 00:13:59.020
uh,
because people,
it's like when you,
when you're on the Internet,

238
00:13:59.021 --> 00:14:03.910
people know you more personally.
And in a more informal setting and not,

239
00:14:04.150 --> 00:14:09.010
they don't really know like the professional you.
Um,
so definitely makes it,

240
00:14:09.011 --> 00:14:12.400
I mean it's,
it's definitely a much more blurred,
but I try to,
I mean,
I,

241
00:14:13.690 --> 00:14:14.120
<v 3>okay.</v>

242
00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:19.010
<v 0>I'm also like an information,
just open book.
Like I can't,</v>

243
00:14:19.011 --> 00:14:23.270
I don't have any secrets.
I share everything.
Like it's,
it's compulsive.

244
00:14:23.271 --> 00:14:27.000
Like I'm a compulsive overshare in many ways.
So I thought and prayed and I'm,

245
00:14:27.001 --> 00:14:31.430
I'm fine with like stories about me making a fool out of myself and sharing
that.

246
00:14:31.431 --> 00:14:35.810
But I am like really reluctant to show footage of my family or the people around

247
00:14:35.811 --> 00:14:39.410
me cause I can,
like,
I can take people being mean to me in the comments,

248
00:14:39.411 --> 00:14:42.950
but if I would have like my sister in a video and they'd be mean to her,

249
00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:47.300
I just like stab my computer screen,
I think.
Yeah.

250
00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:50.980
<v 2>So,
uh,
I was interviewing a friend of yours utuber Diana cower and,</v>

251
00:14:51.410 --> 00:14:55.910
and she said she has to block a words like kitchen and ears from comments.

252
00:14:55.911 --> 00:14:59.030
Don't why?
It's basically people are evil.
Um,
yeah,

253
00:14:59.130 --> 00:15:03.090
<v 0>she does get a lot of Collins without her ears.
Oh,
weird.
It's fair.</v>

254
00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:05.880
I don't think I've ever gotten in Commons about my uterus.
And I'm like,

255
00:15:05.910 --> 00:15:07.250
are they feeling boring areas?

256
00:15:08.670 --> 00:15:13.670
<v 2>So how do you deal with trolls or have you been blessfully not even to deal with</v>

257
00:15:14.071 --> 00:15:14.500
that?

258
00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:18.870
<v 0>So I've only put up one filter on my channel and I made the,
the,</v>

259
00:15:18.871 --> 00:15:21.340
the mistake of telling people that I put out a filter.

260
00:15:21.341 --> 00:15:23.890
So I've seen so many creative spellings of Dildo.

261
00:15:28.330 --> 00:15:32.170
Um,
but I think that's,
yeah,
that's probably the only one.

262
00:15:32.171 --> 00:15:36.610
I mean it is like as I just hit half a million subscribers yesterday.

263
00:15:36.670 --> 00:15:37.503
Yay.

264
00:15:37.910 --> 00:15:42.530
<v 4>Uh,
number happened to lead in the room anywhere maybe?
No.
Yeah,</v>

265
00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:45.550
there you go.
Yeah.

266
00:15:45.980 --> 00:15:50.750
<v 0>Oh,
thank you.
Oh,
that's great.
Um,
cool.
I,
yeah.</v>

267
00:15:50.810 --> 00:15:52.640
Um,
so as,
I mean,

268
00:15:52.641 --> 00:15:56.680
I definitely notice it like as you grow a,

269
00:15:56.750 --> 00:16:00.710
people get progressively meaner and meaner cause like when it's small,

270
00:16:00.711 --> 00:16:04.310
it's just the people who sought you out and he really like it.
But as you grow,

271
00:16:04.311 --> 00:16:07.880
there's like people who didn't really often and they get very upset about you

272
00:16:07.881 --> 00:16:12.440
showing up in their feed or like when the worst is like one a video trends on

273
00:16:12.441 --> 00:16:13.040
youtube.

274
00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:17.300
So I locked myself in my bathroom for 48 hours and that one trended on Youtube.

275
00:16:17.870 --> 00:16:20.300
And when it does that,
it like,

276
00:16:20.780 --> 00:16:24.710
it's like you just like have like this little,
what do you call,

277
00:16:24.711 --> 00:16:29.030
like when you're fishing and you just open up in that and you just get all the

278
00:16:29.031 --> 00:16:33.840
weird sea creatures,
like you get all of it,
all of it.
Um,

279
00:16:33.890 --> 00:16:35.720
but I have actually,

280
00:16:35.721 --> 00:16:38.270
I'm like scared to talk about it cause I don't want to jinx it.

281
00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:41.720
But I've been weirdly spared from a lot of hate.
Um,

282
00:16:41.820 --> 00:16:45.440
and especially being a woman on the Internet,
which tends to be worse.
And like,

283
00:16:46.010 --> 00:16:47.900
I mean,
it's definitely different on different youtube channels.

284
00:16:47.901 --> 00:16:49.220
Like on the test and youtube channel,

285
00:16:49.221 --> 00:16:50.810
I worked for another youtube channel called test at,

286
00:16:50.811 --> 00:16:55.130
it's like refer or just more like focus on my appearance and my sexual

287
00:16:55.140 --> 00:16:58.250
preferences,
very relevant to the videos.
Um,

288
00:16:58.340 --> 00:17:02.180
but on my youtube channel is actually been really nice.
And,
um,

289
00:17:02.780 --> 00:17:06.890
I didn't really know what I've done or haven't done to deserve that.
But it's,

290
00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:08.600
yeah,
it's,
it's been surprisingly nice.

291
00:17:08.780 --> 00:17:10.460
<v 2>So maybe you,
the,
on the,
on the positive side,</v>

292
00:17:10.461 --> 00:17:12.440
you mentioned that a 10 year old might say,
Hey,

293
00:17:12.460 --> 00:17:14.720
I was inspired to build something.
So what's the sweetest,

294
00:17:14.721 --> 00:17:18.020
most memorable thing a fan has done that makes everything you're doing worth it?

295
00:17:19.350 --> 00:17:22.830
<v 0>I mean,
it's,
it's,
it's a lot I think.
Um,</v>

296
00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:27.390
I mean now I'm starting to get like messages from people who have gotten into

297
00:17:27.391 --> 00:17:29.040
engineering school,
um,

298
00:17:29.100 --> 00:17:32.580
because because they sought it out after like seeing my videos,

299
00:17:32.581 --> 00:17:35.970
which feels really weird because you're like,
I am can,

300
00:17:35.971 --> 00:17:38.970
you can like put people on a different life trajectory so that,

301
00:17:38.971 --> 00:17:41.790
that feels really like an honor to be able to do that.

302
00:17:42.030 --> 00:17:46.380
But I think it was like I'm a sucker for getting packages and people send me

303
00:17:46.381 --> 00:17:50.520
such nice things and projects that they built a actually had a people who

304
00:17:50.521 --> 00:17:55.521
fabricated or a guy named Stuart who fabricated this whole robot arm,

305
00:17:56.320 --> 00:18:00.090
uh,
for me.
And he like made it out of like custom aluminum.

306
00:18:00.091 --> 00:18:01.410
Everything was really polished.

307
00:18:01.411 --> 00:18:04.830
He like put like in video footage of him building it.
I mean it was,

308
00:18:04.831 --> 00:18:08.790
must have been like kicking him a week to make it and just the fact that

309
00:18:08.820 --> 00:18:12.660
somebody would spend that much time just to make you happy is,
is pretty wild.

310
00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:14.000
Yeah.

311
00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:15.650
<v 2>Well someone in the eye as mentioned pantry on,</v>

312
00:18:15.660 --> 00:18:20.330
so you ran into a bit of sponsored trouble that you talked about and what's been

313
00:18:20.331 --> 00:18:24.530
your experience with crowdsourcing?
Financial support is another vehicle.

314
00:18:24.830 --> 00:18:28.040
What would you have offered for other creators that want to go that path?

315
00:18:28.150 --> 00:18:31.580
<v 0>So if you don't know,
there is a platform called Patrion and there,</v>

316
00:18:31.590 --> 00:18:35.350
there are multiple platforms I'm on Patrion but where people can give monthly

317
00:18:35.351 --> 00:18:38.650
donations to different independent creators.
And I think it's a really,

318
00:18:38.950 --> 00:18:42.610
it's such a beautiful thing because it's really a democratization.

319
00:18:42.910 --> 00:18:46.990
Did I pronounce that right?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay.
Um,
of,

320
00:18:47.050 --> 00:18:51.270
of content creation because otherwise,
I mean it just makes it a lot.
You,

321
00:18:51.310 --> 00:18:56.110
there's something really sad I find about being an internet person because what

322
00:18:56.111 --> 00:19:00.190
it's all about is like increasing your value as a billboard for brands.

323
00:19:00.460 --> 00:19:03.190
So you're,
and you kind of saw your,

324
00:19:03.370 --> 00:19:06.280
your audience's attention and the trust that they have for you.

325
00:19:06.281 --> 00:19:08.560
And it's just something about that it feels really dirty.

326
00:19:09.130 --> 00:19:13.780
So having alternatives like Patrion is really beautiful and people can go and

327
00:19:13.781 --> 00:19:16.450
support you directly.
It's also really scary.

328
00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:20.290
Like I was pretty reluctant to start a patrion because otherwise I can just be

329
00:19:20.291 --> 00:19:24.940
like,
I don't,
I don't owe people anything.
I feel like,

330
00:19:24.941 --> 00:19:26.890
I mean I don't,
I don't,
I don't know anything,

331
00:19:26.891 --> 00:19:28.270
but I flew him for my patrion supporters.

332
00:19:28.271 --> 00:19:31.290
I really feel that I'm owing them a lot and it's,

333
00:19:31.300 --> 00:19:33.940
it's like a scary thing and many,
cause I'm just like,

334
00:19:33.941 --> 00:19:37.270
the worst thing would be if people were disappointed in you because it'd be like

335
00:19:37.271 --> 00:19:41.530
having 2000 parents who were just like,
Simone,
we just expected more of you.

336
00:19:43.390 --> 00:19:45.430
<v 2>That's right.
Um,</v>

337
00:19:45.460 --> 00:19:48.940
so I think there's some really cool stuff in our world right now that if you go

338
00:19:48.941 --> 00:19:50.320
back in time would blow people away.

339
00:19:50.321 --> 00:19:52.090
And I think one of those is a three d printer.

340
00:19:52.120 --> 00:19:55.720
So if you could go back in time when the three d printer,
what would,

341
00:19:55.721 --> 00:19:57.040
what's a crazy thing you would build?

342
00:19:57.041 --> 00:19:59.200
Or maybe what have you built with a three d printer that you think would blow

343
00:19:59.201 --> 00:20:00.034
people away?

344
00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:04.520
<v 0>I actually may loose thing.
This might be my best contribution to the world.</v>

345
00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:07.640
Do you guys know Neti pots?

346
00:20:09.590 --> 00:20:10.423
<v 2>No.</v>

347
00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:14.840
<v 0>50%.
Yeah.
Can't believe I'm talking about this.</v>

348
00:20:14.900 --> 00:20:19.490
Neti pots.
It's like this weird,
my dad is like an old hippie Yogi,

349
00:20:19.530 --> 00:20:22.580
Dan.
And he always had these many pods.

350
00:20:22.850 --> 00:20:26.390
So basic like it's like with a little pot and you like pour water through your

351
00:20:26.391 --> 00:20:29.540
nose when you have a cold.
It's really nasty,

352
00:20:30.140 --> 00:20:34.550
but it's very effective.
Yeah.
If you're sick.
So I did.
I was,

353
00:20:34.551 --> 00:20:39.200
I had a call then I was like,
I don't have a Neti pot.
What do I do?

354
00:20:39.230 --> 00:20:41.690
I have a three d printer,
so I,

355
00:20:41.740 --> 00:20:45.960
I may like a little nutty Putin awful that goes on just like a regular bottle.

356
00:20:47.350 --> 00:20:49.900
It's the best thing I've ever made.
Like I'm like,

357
00:20:49.930 --> 00:20:53.260
it's a legit thing and that's what I bring to people in Medieval Times.

358
00:20:56.050 --> 00:20:58.320
<v 4>And they'd be like,
we have no bottles.
I'm like,
Oh shit.</v>

359
00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:03.400
<v 2>The hell of the plank.
95,
75.
Um,</v>

360
00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:09.080
so what is your worst robot failure that was so bad that it didn't even rate

361
00:21:09.081 --> 00:21:09.914
being shitty?

362
00:21:12.470 --> 00:21:14.780
<v 0>That's tricky.
I mean,
I feel like it's,
it's,</v>

363
00:21:15.670 --> 00:21:20.270
it's tricky to say like when people ask me like what my shittiest invention is,

364
00:21:20.570 --> 00:21:23.930
it's like,
are my most useless.
It's hard because I've skewed to me,

365
00:21:23.931 --> 00:21:27.770
I'd like skewed what shitty means because to me is shitty robot would be that

366
00:21:27.771 --> 00:21:31.970
worked really well or that worked poorly,
but did it in a very uninteresting way.

367
00:21:31.971 --> 00:21:36.050
I mean,
the shittiest robot is the one that doesn't start,
but that's like,
I mean,

368
00:21:36.051 --> 00:21:40.620
yeah.
Um,
I think my shittiest invention,
I think,
I mean,
I,

369
00:21:40.621 --> 00:21:44.750
I passed on a lot of ideas,
so I start building them and then I'm just like,
no,

370
00:21:44.751 --> 00:21:48.140
this isn't going to,
it happens fairly rarely.
But,
um,

371
00:21:48.380 --> 00:21:50.780
I think I've started building stuff and then I'm like,
I can't,

372
00:21:50.781 --> 00:21:52.100
I can't go through with us.

373
00:21:52.950 --> 00:21:56.110
<v 2>What kind of causes that you started and you stop,
which we do all the time here.</v>

374
00:21:56.130 --> 00:21:57.660
You know,
things you just decided it's not going to work

375
00:21:57.860 --> 00:21:59.210
<v 0>either.
That it's too complicated.</v>

376
00:21:59.211 --> 00:22:03.080
I can't do it in a timeframe that's worth doing it.

377
00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:06.170
Um,
but I think,

378
00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:08.930
or just that I don't think it's fun or relevant anymore,

379
00:22:08.990 --> 00:22:11.570
but I think probably the shittiest machine I've ever made,

380
00:22:12.180 --> 00:22:13.013
<v 3>it's a pun,</v>

381
00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:20.680
<v 0>is a the ass wiping robot probably pretty shitty.
Yeah.</v>

382
00:22:21.110 --> 00:22:25.280
We actually filmed another video on it for tested and I don't think we've

383
00:22:25.281 --> 00:22:27.730
published it.
I don't think we're going to publish it because I didn't,

384
00:22:27.740 --> 00:22:30.860
a lot of people were disappointed that I didn't.
So I did a by wiping real loud,

385
00:22:30.861 --> 00:22:33.950
it's like a toilet paper roll on a drill.
And it just like,

386
00:22:36.410 --> 00:22:39.560
and people were so upset in the comments,
they're like,
Simone,

387
00:22:39.561 --> 00:22:41.560
you couldn't even have like put some Nutella.

388
00:22:41.630 --> 00:22:43.430
They're like this is not believable.

389
00:22:44.610 --> 00:22:47.870
And we like foam to tested video.
We're like,
okay,

390
00:22:47.871 --> 00:22:50.360
we need to like put something that looks like poop in there.

391
00:22:50.750 --> 00:22:54.480
And then like halfway through when you're holding this like mannequin,
man,

392
00:22:57.520 --> 00:23:00.220
<v 4>I don't want this to be on the Internet.</v>

393
00:23:01.390 --> 00:23:03.010
How do we end up here?

394
00:23:05.710 --> 00:23:09.160
<v 2>Yeah.
And I think America is the only thing that would take that robot cause that</v>

395
00:23:09.190 --> 00:23:10.310
looked like it could be a torture.

396
00:23:10.570 --> 00:23:13.950
<v 0>Yeah.
There's no way I'm putting my own bud in their new yeah.
And that's,</v>

397
00:23:14.050 --> 00:23:15.880
I mean I've had that idea for a long time,

398
00:23:15.881 --> 00:23:19.450
but I didn't know how to do it cause I was like I can't do it with anyone's
real.

399
00:23:19.451 --> 00:23:22.930
But,
and I was like,
I'll just buy a setting mannequin.
Yeah.

400
00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:28.500
<v 2>I had a chance to interview Adam Savage several years ago and was struck by how</v>

401
00:23:28.501 --> 00:23:31.830
down to earth he is.
I like to call them an accidental celebrity.

402
00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:35.100
I really enjoyed your back and forth with Adam on the show tested that you

403
00:23:35.101 --> 00:23:38.670
mentioned trying to work out the popcorn machine.
Uh,

404
00:23:38.671 --> 00:23:40.020
walk me through creating that video,

405
00:23:40.021 --> 00:23:45.021
especially the feeling you had when Adam's vacuum form hands that he created as

406
00:23:45.981 --> 00:23:48.890
part of this project in gear arrived and you had to turn it into a robot.

407
00:23:48.891 --> 00:23:52.460
I will feel like,
oh,
this is from Adam Savage.
ICON pressure.

408
00:23:52.870 --> 00:23:56.650
<v 0>Yeah.
Uh,
it was,
it was really intimidating because he's like,</v>

409
00:23:57.100 --> 00:24:01.690
I have no idea what I'm doing and he really knows what he's doing even though he

410
00:24:01.691 --> 00:24:03.700
wouldn't say so.
I think,
um,

411
00:24:03.701 --> 00:24:07.690
so we started working together about a year ago now,
a little bit more.

412
00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:11.290
And the other first project that we bought was a popcorn helmet.

413
00:24:11.291 --> 00:24:12.550
So it was like beer helmet,

414
00:24:12.551 --> 00:24:14.910
but instead it was two popcorn containers and two hands.

415
00:24:15.990 --> 00:24:20.340
So you don't have to use your own hands.
Um,
and yeah,
we,

416
00:24:20.341 --> 00:24:24.610
we collaborated on it and he did like the hand mechanism and I got the package.

417
00:24:24.611 --> 00:24:26.590
I remember the first thing I did,
I have told him this.

418
00:24:26.830 --> 00:24:28.840
First thing I did was I looked at the box and I was like,

419
00:24:29.080 --> 00:24:33.750
did he like give a signature anywhere?
Like could I get his autograph from here?

420
00:24:33.770 --> 00:24:38.170
Just like cut it out.
I'm like,
um,
but it was,

421
00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:43.240
I mean I still like whenever you,
I mean now it's a lot chiller with tested,

422
00:24:43.241 --> 00:24:47.710
but in the beginning I had the worst imposter syndrome and especially building

423
00:24:47.711 --> 00:24:50.650
stuff with him.
And before having met him,

424
00:24:50.651 --> 00:24:55.420
it was really scary cause I was like just sweating being like I have,
I can't,

425
00:24:55.510 --> 00:24:57.970
what if I don't get it together or are they going to like fire me?

426
00:24:58.420 --> 00:25:00.580
But once you get to know him,

427
00:25:00.581 --> 00:25:03.760
he's like the most devoted teacher and mentor.

428
00:25:04.030 --> 00:25:06.640
So whenever you like don't know how to do something,

429
00:25:06.641 --> 00:25:09.470
it almost feels like it makes him happy and he's like,
Ooh,

430
00:25:09.550 --> 00:25:11.490
I can like explain those things.
So it,

431
00:25:11.491 --> 00:25:15.530
and that just like completely takes the edge of often my fear.
So yeah,
he's,

432
00:25:15.531 --> 00:25:19.030
he's been great,
but if he'd be any,
I mean,
yeah,

433
00:25:19.060 --> 00:25:22.720
I think it's all due to him just being very kind,
very kind.

434
00:25:22.900 --> 00:25:26.710
<v 2>Cool.
That's just what he seems like an a on the other side of the glass.</v>

435
00:25:26.711 --> 00:25:31.530
So you had a terrific segment also on Stephen Colbert show recently?
Yes.
Um,

436
00:25:31.660 --> 00:25:34.690
what happened behind the scenes because you only get six minutes on television,

437
00:25:34.691 --> 00:25:35.524
but you would actually,

438
00:25:36.070 --> 00:25:39.340
well here if you're in product group you'll be terrified of any sort of live

439
00:25:39.341 --> 00:25:40.750
demo.
It's the scariest thing you do.

440
00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:43.150
You had multiple live demos that you brought with you.

441
00:25:43.151 --> 00:25:46.120
What was it like leading up to that six minutes that you can't do anything but

442
00:25:46.121 --> 00:25:47.350
do that six minutes and you're done?

443
00:25:47.590 --> 00:25:48.423
<v 0>Um,</v>

444
00:25:48.560 --> 00:25:53.320
it was a lot of death thoughts,

445
00:25:53.410 --> 00:25:57.400
thoughts about that?
No,
it was,
it was,

446
00:25:57.460 --> 00:26:00.160
I mean the circumstances were pretty special cause so I had,

447
00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:02.200
I was just about to move to San Francisco,

448
00:26:02.201 --> 00:26:05.770
so I had everything packed with me and I'd been to La for Youtube Event and then

449
00:26:05.771 --> 00:26:09.130
I've been to Vancouver to pick out my us visa.
And then I went,

450
00:26:09.160 --> 00:26:12.940
I did the Redeye from Vancouver to New York and I came there and I was on set

451
00:26:13.180 --> 00:26:14.500
for 10 hours,

452
00:26:14.501 --> 00:26:18.790
like from early in the morning cause they like switched around the schedule.
Uh,

453
00:26:18.791 --> 00:26:23.410
so I had 10 hours of having slept for three hours and just being super tired and

454
00:26:23.411 --> 00:26:26.940
really nervous.
So it was actually pretty,
uh,

455
00:26:26.941 --> 00:26:29.800
I mean it is always like painful,
but I feel like that always,

456
00:26:29.801 --> 00:26:32.590
I give a lot of talks and always before I go on stage I'm like,

457
00:26:33.310 --> 00:26:36.190
why do I do this for myself?
It's,
it's always like,

458
00:26:36.970 --> 00:26:41.560
I always think that this is the time when everything is going to go wrong.
Um,

459
00:26:41.590 --> 00:26:44.490
but they were,
so of what I'm trying to always,

460
00:26:44.491 --> 00:26:47.070
when I do stuff like that is like I'm trying,

461
00:26:47.071 --> 00:26:49.500
I mean especially with somebody like Stephen Colbert,

462
00:26:49.501 --> 00:26:54.240
you tried to remind yourself that this is like he's one of the best in the world

463
00:26:54.310 --> 00:26:59.310
and doing what he's doing and we share the responsibility of making it fun and

464
00:27:00.361 --> 00:27:01.110
interesting.

465
00:27:01.110 --> 00:27:05.190
So you're like in really good hands is what I'm trying to remind you my cell

466
00:27:05.191 --> 00:27:05.550
phone.

467
00:27:05.550 --> 00:27:10.550
But it's really scary because I brought four machines and just making sure that

468
00:27:11.431 --> 00:27:14.060
all of them,
I mean,
you know,
yeah,
it was like why have demos?

469
00:27:14.070 --> 00:27:18.690
Like they never work and just making sure that all of them would work reliably

470
00:27:18.870 --> 00:27:19.920
was,
was really,

471
00:27:19.921 --> 00:27:24.630
I was more worried about that then like what I was going to say or do.
Um,

472
00:27:25.260 --> 00:27:28.740
and yeah,
but all the machines worked and I always like,
I've thought,

473
00:27:28.741 --> 00:27:30.780
because I've had times when the machine doesn't start.

474
00:27:30.781 --> 00:27:32.410
I did like a backend Sweden,

475
00:27:32.430 --> 00:27:36.750
I did a live kids show and like five minutes before we go on stage,

476
00:27:36.780 --> 00:27:39.330
the robot arm that I used for the breakfast machine just broke down.

477
00:27:40.290 --> 00:27:43.500
And it's like,
you're like,
what are you supposed to do?

478
00:27:43.501 --> 00:27:47.670
And that's like your responsibility.
Um,
but I've just thought that like,

479
00:27:47.671 --> 00:27:50.820
whenever it doesn't start,
I'll just be like shitty.
Right.

480
00:27:52.690 --> 00:27:53.820
And then it's okay.

481
00:27:54.590 --> 00:27:59.210
<v 2>So,
uh,
it's sorta ties into,
you were went through Canada to,
um,</v>

482
00:27:59.240 --> 00:28:00.680
to come to the states are getting visa.

483
00:28:00.681 --> 00:28:05.420
So Sweden makes these top countries to live in the world's less frequently.

484
00:28:05.421 --> 00:28:08.330
So what attracts you?
The United States and specifically San Francisco.

485
00:28:09.230 --> 00:28:09.801
<v 0>I mean,
I,</v>

486
00:28:09.801 --> 00:28:12.770
so I lived in San Francisco two years ago when I had that maker in residence
job.

487
00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:17.030
I just think it's a really fun place to live and having a kind of weird job in

488
00:28:17.031 --> 00:28:21.170
San Francisco.
I don't feel weird.
And Stockholm my fear feel a little bit weird.

489
00:28:21.550 --> 00:28:23.930
Uh,
but here it's like everybody's a unicorn.

490
00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:26.480
And I think that was really heartwarming.

491
00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:29.390
And also I just love paying a lot in rent.

492
00:28:29.420 --> 00:28:33.200
It's this weird thing I get a kick out of,
you know?
Yeah.

493
00:28:33.660 --> 00:28:37.620
<v 2>So,
uh,
got,
ask a question about Ikea because Sweden,</v>

494
00:28:37.830 --> 00:28:42.830
so if you can go into Ikea and get a debit card paid for by someone else,

495
00:28:43.051 --> 00:28:46.680
you can buy anything you want,
including the meatballs,
first of all,

496
00:28:46.681 --> 00:28:48.390
what you want to do that.
And second of all,
would you,

497
00:28:48.391 --> 00:28:50.640
what would you build with anything you can buy at Ikea?

498
00:28:51.170 --> 00:28:55.650
<v 0>I like very rarely buy stuff at Ikea,
but I have gotten away.</v>

499
00:28:57.830 --> 00:29:02.120
Yeah.
Uh,
I have gotten away with a lot of times I trick people that,
uh,

500
00:29:02.150 --> 00:29:04.940
if you're a Swedish and you lose your passport,

501
00:29:05.180 --> 00:29:09.760
you can go to Ikea and it works as the Swedish embassy.
You can get a new one.

502
00:29:11.700 --> 00:29:16.640
Um,
but what would I build?
I mean,

503
00:29:16.641 --> 00:29:20.590
I've been wanting to projects that I wanted to build and that can buy,

504
00:29:20.650 --> 00:29:25.650
build out of Ikea cars is I want to have a couch so you can lay down on,

505
00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:30.260
and then you have a seat belt that comes from the back and you can like plug

506
00:29:30.261 --> 00:29:34.610
yourself into the couch so you're like seated down and then you can just drive

507
00:29:34.611 --> 00:29:36.350
to the fridge.
Uh,

508
00:29:38.720 --> 00:29:42.070
probably do that.
Yeah.
For the lazy person.

509
00:29:42.180 --> 00:29:44.680
<v 2>And what,
what Swedish name would you give to that?
Cause all these,
I don't know,</v>

510
00:29:44.710 --> 00:29:46.620
these Ikea Real Swedish words.
Is it just a,

511
00:29:46.680 --> 00:29:51.510
<v 0>it's real Swedish words.
Uh,
I'd probably call it,
um,
let,</v>

512
00:29:51.511 --> 00:29:55.660
yeah,
let,
yeah,
Let,
yeah,
laziness.
Oh yeah.

513
00:29:56.690 --> 00:30:00.800
<v 2>Okay.
So one more question from me and then the audience gets to take over.
So,
uh,</v>

514
00:30:00.801 --> 00:30:04.190
if you could have a cameo in one of the following,

515
00:30:04.191 --> 00:30:08.690
which would you choose and why?
So Star Trek,
Lord of the Rings,

516
00:30:09.380 --> 00:30:11.840
Star Wars,
which are recent convert to,

517
00:30:11.841 --> 00:30:13.820
or at least recent viewer moving around so much,

518
00:30:14.090 --> 00:30:17.110
or Shark Nedo Lord

519
00:30:17.110 --> 00:30:19.500
<v 0>of the Rings,
hands down.
Or that was it.</v>

520
00:30:19.580 --> 00:30:20.800
<v 2>Die Wise.
Loadings when</v>

521
00:30:20.850 --> 00:30:23.220
<v 0>I was a huge Lord of the rings fan when I was younger,</v>

522
00:30:23.221 --> 00:30:26.470
I went through an elvish phase.
Yeah.

523
00:30:29.960 --> 00:30:34.380
Uh,
and I had a huge crush on every Orlando Bloom.
Yeah.

524
00:30:34.410 --> 00:30:38.940
So I do it just to make 14 year olds.
Simone's proud.

525
00:30:39.330 --> 00:30:40.163
All right.
Laurie

526
00:30:40.230 --> 00:30:44.360
<v 2>is if you're going to do an episode,
a seven,
not the Hobbit,
then here you go.
Yes.</v>

527
00:30:44.420 --> 00:30:47.490
Alright.
So I'm gonna grab my computer so we can do,
uh,
some dory questions,

528
00:30:47.491 --> 00:30:49.290
which is our online question answer tool.

529
00:30:49.291 --> 00:30:53.640
And then Somara from the Google loose team's going to help out with Mike phones.

530
00:30:54.020 --> 00:30:57.440
<v 0>Oh Gosh.
Yeah.
I was a,
I mean,
I wouldn't do a cameo.</v>

531
00:30:57.470 --> 00:31:02.470
I wanted to do a voiceover or like I love to do a voiceover for adventure time.

532
00:31:04.010 --> 00:31:07.640
Oh,
one of my favorite TV shows and as soon as I put it out there,

533
00:31:07.730 --> 00:31:10.550
I realized that they're about to discontinue the show and they've already be

534
00:31:10.551 --> 00:31:14.720
recorded.
The last episode,
it made me so sad.
Oh yeah.

535
00:31:15.360 --> 00:31:17.130
<v 2>All right.
So first question out here.</v>

536
00:31:17.870 --> 00:31:22.640
<v 5>Okay.
Uh,
you spoke briefly about the relationship between advertisers and content</v>

537
00:31:22.641 --> 00:31:24.680
creators as it relates to the quality of the work.

538
00:31:24.980 --> 00:31:27.650
And I wanted to just hear a little bit more about your thoughts about that,

539
00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:32.350
<v 0>uh,
how it relates to the call quality of the work that you put out as a creator.</v>

540
00:31:32.760 --> 00:31:36.270
<v 5>Yeah.
And,
and how,
you know,
creatures can survive.
Well,
you know,</v>

541
00:31:36.271 --> 00:31:37.850
in this relationship and what that does.

542
00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:40.910
<v 0>Yeah.
I think,
I mean it's,
it's definitely,</v>

543
00:31:41.180 --> 00:31:46.180
you just need to find sponsors who are fully okay with what you're doing and who

544
00:31:46.191 --> 00:31:46.820
don't.

545
00:31:46.820 --> 00:31:50.270
I think it is as soon as you have companies come in and tell you what you can

546
00:31:50.271 --> 00:31:55.010
and can't do creatively.
I,
I mean maybe some people are better at handling that,

547
00:31:55.011 --> 00:31:57.170
but I,
cause you're such a,

548
00:31:57.200 --> 00:32:01.850
like as as a youtuber specially,
I mean offer you're your own producer,

549
00:32:01.851 --> 00:32:04.280
you're your own writer,
you're the on camera talent,

550
00:32:04.330 --> 00:32:08.780
the camera person and having somebody be like,
oh,
you can't say that.
Um,

551
00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:10.970
is,
is just really weird.

552
00:32:11.270 --> 00:32:16.270
And I think also like what a lot of companies that aren't very customed to the

553
00:32:16.821 --> 00:32:18.500
field,
they're working with online talent.

554
00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:22.340
What they don't understand is like the audience is completely accustomed to this

555
00:32:22.341 --> 00:32:25.070
person being the way that they've always been.

556
00:32:25.280 --> 00:32:29.600
And as soon as you start altering that,
that's immediately going to be like,

557
00:32:29.601 --> 00:32:32.210
people are like,
it's like when your,

558
00:32:32.250 --> 00:32:36.380
your parents like snuck in medicine and you're drinking,
you're like slick,

559
00:32:36.381 --> 00:32:40.790
something weird about this.
Like you're trying to get something down me.
So,
um,

560
00:32:40.940 --> 00:32:43.760
I think it's a lot of that,
like I think the most successful companies,

561
00:32:43.761 --> 00:32:48.120
I mean something like audible does or where they're just like,
yeah,
you,

562
00:32:48.121 --> 00:32:51.860
you do whatever we like.
We don't,
we don't really judge what,
what you do or like,

563
00:32:52.250 --> 00:32:55.340
I mean within a range.
But,
um,
yeah,

564
00:32:55.341 --> 00:32:58.520
I think that's the way to do it because as soon as you get the legal team

565
00:32:58.521 --> 00:33:01.700
involved,
they're like,
we can't do this.
We can't do this,
we can't do this,

566
00:33:01.701 --> 00:33:02.361
you can't do this.

567
00:33:02.361 --> 00:33:05.930
So I think it's just being conscientious of what companies do you choose to work

568
00:33:05.931 --> 00:33:10.310
with and making sure that they are very well understanding about the type of

569
00:33:10.311 --> 00:33:11.144
content you make.

570
00:33:11.600 --> 00:33:14.150
<v 2>Pool.
So we can take one from the dory and then we'll go back in the room,</v>

571
00:33:15.190 --> 00:33:18.340
<v 0>but like put a delta on it and know what,
stop asking.</v>

572
00:33:19.090 --> 00:33:20.200
Come on.

573
00:33:20.300 --> 00:33:22.730
<v 2>So this is actually a Google that's watching from Google,
Boston.</v>

574
00:33:22.790 --> 00:33:24.770
Hello Google Boston.
Um,

575
00:33:24.830 --> 00:33:28.970
before working here I was a ta teaching assistant for a robotics class.

576
00:33:28.971 --> 00:33:32.450
Your video definitely helped motivate me to build stuff in the job,

577
00:33:32.451 --> 00:33:34.340
which in turn helped me get into Google.
So thank you.

578
00:33:34.370 --> 00:33:35.690
Well that's not really a question.

579
00:33:37.560 --> 00:33:38.940
<v 0>Oh,
that's good to hear.</v>

580
00:33:39.820 --> 00:33:43.900
<v 6>Question for the room.
Hey.
Oh,
there we go.</v>

581
00:33:44.890 --> 00:33:46.470
So thanks for talking.
Um,

582
00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:51.340
I just wanted to know how you find inspiration for your ideas and what to do

583
00:33:51.341 --> 00:33:52.174
next.

584
00:33:52.490 --> 00:33:54.770
<v 0>So thanks for listening.
Um,</v>

585
00:33:55.220 --> 00:33:57.530
I find inspiration.

586
00:33:57.531 --> 00:34:00.500
I mean a lot of it spurs from everyday problems I have and just being,

587
00:34:00.770 --> 00:34:03.680
I mean I'm just a very ambitious,
lazy person.

588
00:34:03.681 --> 00:34:06.370
I think I go through lengths to,

589
00:34:06.371 --> 00:34:10.130
to help myself with the everyday problems that I have.
It's a lot that,

590
00:34:10.131 --> 00:34:13.850
but I mean more recently I find like there's just so much shit going on in our

591
00:34:13.851 --> 00:34:18.260
world and that I feel needs shitty robots solutions.
Like the,

592
00:34:18.261 --> 00:34:21.590
I did a pussy grabs back machine,
which was this arm,

593
00:34:21.591 --> 00:34:24.710
this plastic arm that went out for your crotch and it was a mouse trap and I was

594
00:34:24.711 --> 00:34:26.390
like,
Dang,
puts the grass back.

595
00:34:26.750 --> 00:34:30.230
And I think that like now I find a lot of inspiration,

596
00:34:30.231 --> 00:34:32.300
just things that are happening in society.

597
00:34:32.570 --> 00:34:35.180
But I mean this summit is also just like body maintenance,

598
00:34:35.780 --> 00:34:40.340
like maintaining your body in different ways and like,
yeah,
getting,

599
00:34:40.341 --> 00:34:44.540
I mean most recently I did a manicure robot to help me paint my nails and yeah.

600
00:34:44.820 --> 00:34:48.380
<v 2>The Shampoo robot where you learn what it feels like to have your hair pulled by</v>

601
00:34:48.381 --> 00:34:49.214
a robot.

602
00:34:49.260 --> 00:34:52.310
<v 0>Yeah,
the wake of machine.
I think that my</v>

603
00:34:53.870 --> 00:34:57.810
got tangled up and yeah,
it was very humiliating and painful.

604
00:34:58.160 --> 00:35:02.250
<v 6>Alright.
Yup.
Yup.
My,
my kids and I are big fans of your channels and uh,</v>

605
00:35:02.280 --> 00:35:07.260
also Peter on supporters,
um,
have to ask,
you're in San Francisco now,
uh,

606
00:35:07.320 --> 00:35:11.730
again and burning man.
Have you been,
are you going,
uh,

607
00:35:11.990 --> 00:35:12.823
seemed like a natural,

608
00:35:12.990 --> 00:35:17.340
<v 0>I was there two years ago.
Yeah,
it was.</v>

609
00:35:20.660 --> 00:35:22.550
Oh Gosh,
I'm doing that thing.

610
00:35:22.610 --> 00:35:25.190
I'm doing that thing that people who have been to burning man,
they were,

611
00:35:25.200 --> 00:35:30.170
it's like you can't really describe it.
It was,

612
00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:33.920
it was a no,
I really,
I liked it a lot.
It was very weird.

613
00:35:33.921 --> 00:35:37.320
It was such a mind fuck cause you were like with normal Simone do this or not

614
00:35:37.350 --> 00:35:39.210
like how,
um,

615
00:35:39.620 --> 00:35:43.290
but also I am just like not that much of a party person.

616
00:35:43.291 --> 00:35:48.140
I get very tired and I need to sleep a lot and it's a long time and it was

617
00:35:48.150 --> 00:35:50.580
really,
this is like a tricky thing but I'm not,

618
00:35:50.581 --> 00:35:52.860
I'm not going this year but I might go in future years.

619
00:35:52.861 --> 00:35:56.910
It would be fun and I feel like I could,
I'd want to build something big.
Yeah.

620
00:35:57.820 --> 00:36:01.350
<v 6>Cool.
Have any of your robots turn out to be not so shitty?</v>

621
00:36:01.351 --> 00:36:03.870
Kind of too useful to be funny?
Um,

622
00:36:04.380 --> 00:36:08.040
because we all love when they go wrong,
but I see him sometimes.

623
00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:09.510
<v 0>Uh,
I actually got,</v>

624
00:36:09.550 --> 00:36:12.840
the thing is people get very upset with me if they're not shitty enough.

625
00:36:12.841 --> 00:36:17.430
So for example,
when Scott and I did the bureau by um,

626
00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:20.280
one of the cakes,
it kind of,
so it was a robot,

627
00:36:20.470 --> 00:36:24.300
like put down the cup and then pour it a beer and like handed me the beer.

628
00:36:24.630 --> 00:36:25.950
It was one of the takes where it was like,

629
00:36:25.951 --> 00:36:29.250
it was still like spraying me with beer,
but people who are like,

630
00:36:29.850 --> 00:36:34.050
smell this is a shitty enough was like,
what have you because,

631
00:36:35.220 --> 00:36:39.510
and they were like really disappointed in me that it worked too well.
So,

632
00:36:40.020 --> 00:36:43.790
um,
but yeah,
usually,
I mean they just like most of them just really sucks.

633
00:36:43.791 --> 00:36:45.720
So yeah,
they're,
they're good at it.

634
00:36:45.770 --> 00:36:48.080
<v 6>Liz,
almost something like you,
if you get more budget,</v>

635
00:36:48.081 --> 00:36:51.040
I hope you keep it to yourself cause you shouldn't invest,
invested,

636
00:36:51.700 --> 00:36:54.890
I mean robots that would totally kill it.
So I mean,

637
00:36:55.340 --> 00:36:59.650
I don't want to invest in like stronger and bigger motors.
Yeah.
Okay.
Yeah.

638
00:37:00.300 --> 00:37:03.430
But just the scale of the shittiness would go out,
but not the cool.
Yeah,

639
00:37:03.790 --> 00:37:06.820
<v 0>no.
All right.
No,
but I realize I have the only,</v>

640
00:37:07.420 --> 00:37:11.300
probably one of the few jobs where the,
the,

641
00:37:11.301 --> 00:37:14.200
the sentence that was really shitty,

642
00:37:14.230 --> 00:37:18.430
great job actually makes sense and isn't just passive aggressive.

643
00:37:18.850 --> 00:37:19.683
Yeah.

644
00:37:20.690 --> 00:37:23.370
<v 6>We'll take a few more questions.
So we've got one back there.
Yeah.</v>

645
00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:24.950
<v 7>So Simone,
ah,</v>

646
00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:28.590
you've told about how you have done a lot of different things and I,

647
00:37:28.660 --> 00:37:32.010
I guess you'll continue to do a lot of different things and it's really

648
00:37:32.011 --> 00:37:36.770
inspiring,
but at the same time it's,
it must've been pretty scary.
So I'm,

649
00:37:36.771 --> 00:37:41.771
my question is how did you practically go about finding out and doing the right

650
00:37:42.001 --> 00:37:43.710
research to become successful?

651
00:37:43.711 --> 00:37:46.390
And now all of these different things that you did because,
uh,

652
00:37:46.560 --> 00:37:51.270
when you start doing something new,
uh,
you might not have all the information.

653
00:37:51.271 --> 00:37:55.860
So did you just like go on Google and type in how can I be an astronaut?

654
00:37:57.280 --> 00:38:01.600
<v 0>I think it's,
I mean,
I'm definitely not been successful at everything I've done.</v>

655
00:38:01.720 --> 00:38:04.570
I've been pretty terrible.
I have a lot of stuff.
Like,
I mean,

656
00:38:04.571 --> 00:38:08.200
I worked as an MMA reporter,
I was a pretty bad umihmmmi reporter.

657
00:38:10.070 --> 00:38:14.770
Um,
so I,
but like I think the key thing too,

658
00:38:14.850 --> 00:38:17.680
and I understand like it's,
it's,
it's been a huge privilege,

659
00:38:17.681 --> 00:38:22.150
like having supportive parents and growing up as a middle class person in the

660
00:38:22.151 --> 00:38:25.180
country like Sweden because I've had the opportunity to try out a lot of

661
00:38:25.181 --> 00:38:27.910
different things.
And,
um,

662
00:38:28.660 --> 00:38:33.660
I think mostly like what I realize is because I had this like feeling that I was

663
00:38:34.090 --> 00:38:37.960
very duty and I had this feeling that like for it to be important,

664
00:38:38.050 --> 00:38:41.350
it has to be hard.
Like it has to be a struggle and you have to be,

665
00:38:41.410 --> 00:38:44.680
have to push yourself really hard.
And then like in my early twenties,

666
00:38:44.681 --> 00:38:45.580
I realized like,
wait,

667
00:38:45.581 --> 00:38:49.000
but I'm like a lot better at the things that I'm enthusiastic about and that I

668
00:38:49.001 --> 00:38:51.430
actually like in the don't really feel like work.

669
00:38:51.670 --> 00:38:55.000
So I think it was just that shift in perspective and trying to pursue the things

670
00:38:55.001 --> 00:38:59.860
that I feel that I'm good at and that I really enjoy doing and that somehow feel

671
00:38:59.861 --> 00:39:03.880
a little bit guilty to be spending time on to,
to just do more of that.

672
00:39:03.910 --> 00:39:07.510
Because that's like,
you're,
you're obviously going to be better at that.
Yeah.

673
00:39:07.540 --> 00:39:09.370
And to me it's just building things.
Don't work

674
00:39:10.780 --> 00:39:14.690
<v 6>over here.
Thanks.
Uh,
I'm not sure how much you'd like to predict the future,</v>

675
00:39:14.990 --> 00:39:19.520
but I am very curious to know what you think the role of robotics will be in

676
00:39:19.550 --> 00:39:23.180
like theatrical performances and musical performances.

677
00:39:23.370 --> 00:39:28.310
<v 0>Oh,
that's interesting.
Um,
I don't,
I don't actually know it's,</v>

678
00:39:28.320 --> 00:39:32.040
it's an interesting thing cause like I'm,
I'm basically,
I mean I'm a hobbyist.

679
00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:37.320
The happened to gain a following and often I get like interview questions about

680
00:39:38.311 --> 00:39:41.430
like what does the future of artificial intelligence?
And I'm like,

681
00:39:41.460 --> 00:39:44.550
I'm not an authority in this field,
but I think it,
I mean,

682
00:39:44.580 --> 00:39:46.470
I think that definitely,
I mean,

683
00:39:46.830 --> 00:39:50.970
people have this urge to create everything that we have around us into comedy.

684
00:39:51.240 --> 00:39:54.450
And I think that as we are more,
more surrounded by technology,

685
00:39:54.451 --> 00:39:58.170
that definitely gets integrated into the arts more.
So.
I mean,

686
00:39:58.920 --> 00:40:02.570
I'll do a shitty robotic show.
I might even sing a little bit

687
00:40:02.650 --> 00:40:07.520
<v 6>so
fair in the bay area.
I have.
Yeah.</v>

688
00:40:07.521 --> 00:40:11.960
But I'm going to miss it this year.
Maker fairs still go,
but the next time.

689
00:40:12.170 --> 00:40:15.590
All right,
let's take one more good,
one more audience question right back here.

690
00:40:15.990 --> 00:40:20.450
Um,
I want you to ask you if one of your creations where to gain Saint Anne's,

691
00:40:20.690 --> 00:40:25.690
which one would you be most afraid off and which one were you the happiest of?

692
00:40:26.151 --> 00:40:29.390
Of having them become the drone hair cutter?
That would be my nightmare

693
00:40:29.640 --> 00:40:33.530
<v 0>drone.
Haircutter thou would be a good way.
Yeah.</v>

694
00:40:34.770 --> 00:40:38.960
But I think probably so megabots made a,

695
00:40:38.970 --> 00:40:43.200
they have these huge fighting robots and they made a chopping machine extension

696
00:40:43.201 --> 00:40:45.630
for their robots.
So it's like eight foot long knives.

697
00:40:45.870 --> 00:40:49.410
I feel like having that one run after me would probably be peering terrifying.

698
00:40:49.440 --> 00:40:53.530
I chopped up an oven with it.
Uh,
I,

699
00:40:53.550 --> 00:40:58.550
I think that one and the one I most want to have sen probably the applause

700
00:40:58.621 --> 00:41:01.950
machine because if it knew by itself,

701
00:41:01.951 --> 00:41:04.530
like when it needed to clap and not,
that would be great.

702
00:41:04.590 --> 00:41:06.430
It'd be like the perfect audience.
Yeah,

703
00:41:07.410 --> 00:41:11.880
I did swap all of you out for the applause.
You're all going to be,
yeah,

704
00:41:12.420 --> 00:41:15.840
you're all going to be replaced.
So how many takes it takes for me to get it.

705
00:41:15.841 --> 00:41:18.780
So usually,
I mean I've like transitioned a little bit from that,

706
00:41:18.781 --> 00:41:20.680
but usually what I did start,

707
00:41:20.910 --> 00:41:24.660
I did it only for the Gif and that's like the whole filming the video is that I

708
00:41:24.661 --> 00:41:26.880
can get a little Gif of this project working.

709
00:41:27.300 --> 00:41:29.760
And I think like the wakeup machine,
I mean I do,

710
00:41:29.761 --> 00:41:33.770
I mean sometimes I do like 20 takes and the wake of machine was really,

711
00:41:33.980 --> 00:41:36.620
now it's nicer because they have Scott who is sitting over there who,

712
00:41:36.680 --> 00:41:37.910
who helps me and can be like,

713
00:41:37.911 --> 00:41:40.310
okay that was good or that wasn't bad cause otherwise it's just me and I'm like

714
00:41:40.430 --> 00:41:44.270
running back and checking that everything was in frame.
And um,
but yeah,

715
00:41:44.271 --> 00:41:45.380
it does take a fair amount of takes.

716
00:41:45.381 --> 00:41:47.810
I think the worst mode is actually the lipstick robot.

717
00:41:47.900 --> 00:41:52.400
So it had a robot arm put lipstick on me and I think I did just like five to 10

718
00:41:52.401 --> 00:41:53.234
takes on that one.

719
00:41:53.630 --> 00:41:57.770
But in between each take I was like covered in lipstick and I had to like wipe

720
00:41:57.771 --> 00:42:01.640
it off and like try and cover it up with more,
uh,
with more makeup.

721
00:42:01.790 --> 00:42:05.600
And at the end of it I had like the worst rash in my face because I just like

722
00:42:05.601 --> 00:42:08.720
had like layers and layers of lipstick and you just had to like scrape it off.

723
00:42:09.020 --> 00:42:12.620
But I think that was actually the most painful one.
And yeah,

724
00:42:12.720 --> 00:42:15.990
<v 6>so the coverup machine to go along with the lipstick meetings,
that would start,</v>

725
00:42:15.991 --> 00:42:18.480
that would actually be useful.
It works

726
00:42:18.850 --> 00:42:23.710
<v 0>well.
So I was like,
this is like way off brand.
I can show this.
No.
Yeah.</v>

727
00:42:23.711 --> 00:42:24.820
But that would have been something.

728
00:42:25.360 --> 00:42:27.250
<v 6>It just,
again,
it sounds too useful.</v>

729
00:42:27.290 --> 00:42:32.110
<v 0>So sounds to useful.
They're not a lot of people.
I mean,
yeah,</v>

730
00:42:32.111 --> 00:42:36.460
a lot of people do useless,
useful things.
I can't compete with that.

731
00:42:36.461 --> 00:42:40.810
Like I can't,
but I not,
I mean it's just like,
it's all about finding a field,

732
00:42:40.811 --> 00:42:42.880
the small enough so you can be at the top of it.

733
00:42:43.180 --> 00:42:48.140
<v 6>You have cornered,
you've cornered the useless market.
You're so smart.</v>

734
00:42:49.590 --> 00:42:53.090
<v 0>It's going to find,
it's like narrow enough so you're like,
okay,</v>

735
00:42:53.091 --> 00:42:57.880
I can actually like climb to the top of this thing.
I'm useless enterprises.

736
00:42:59.060 --> 00:43:03.130
Oh,
I mean there is a,
I can't say that I'm the number one.
Uh,
no,
there,

737
00:43:03.380 --> 00:43:06.080
there is a few people who do stuff like that.
There's a new,

738
00:43:06.200 --> 00:43:11.180
a guy who's like really doing well,
his name is William and he does,

739
00:43:11.210 --> 00:43:15.680
um,
he mainly does like laser cutting stuff,
but he does like really weird stuff.

740
00:43:15.681 --> 00:43:20.360
Like he did a ham,
ham and cheese sandwich than diesel.

741
00:43:20.690 --> 00:43:22.760
That was like laser cut layers of just ham.

742
00:43:22.761 --> 00:43:25.700
So he's just like laser cut a bunch of Buckingham and it turns into this like

743
00:43:25.701 --> 00:43:29.540
vin diesel model.
Um,
I think that there's also a company,

744
00:43:29.541 --> 00:43:33.310
a Canadian guy runs to use like useless duck company.

745
00:43:33.311 --> 00:43:35.380
So he did,
he might have seen it.

746
00:43:35.381 --> 00:43:39.140
It was like a baby feeding machine where there's like an APP connected and

747
00:43:39.141 --> 00:43:42.170
there's like a little bottle that goes up to a crib and the baby's like
standing.

748
00:43:42.171 --> 00:43:45.800
It's a little doll and the bottle just like punches the baby in the face and it

749
00:43:45.801 --> 00:43:46.634
falls over.

750
00:43:47.170 --> 00:43:47.411
<v 6>Well,</v>

751
00:43:47.411 --> 00:43:51.820
I want to thank you for checking down to the Googleplex today and sharing your

752
00:43:51.821 --> 00:43:55.620
stories and for everyone who turned out online and virtual in Boston.
Um,

753
00:43:55.660 --> 00:43:57.820
so thank you very much.
It was great.
How many here?

754
00:43:57.880 --> 00:43:59.840
<v 0>Thanks for letting me come.
Thanks for showing up.</v>

755
00:44:00.250 --> 00:44:05.250
