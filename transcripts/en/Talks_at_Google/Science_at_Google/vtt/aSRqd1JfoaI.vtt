1
00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:09.450
And it's my pleasure to be here today with doctor Mark Ketta.
Koski.

2
00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:11.570
It was a brief introduction.

3
00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:15.890
Mark is president of the longevity company forever labs and it was the first to

4
00:00:15.891 --> 00:00:20.450
demonstrate that micro RNA functions as a communication molecule between brain

5
00:00:20.451 --> 00:00:21.290
tumor cells.

6
00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:25.820
He has a medical physicist with extensive experience developing stem cell

7
00:00:25.821 --> 00:00:28.640
therapies for neurological disease and injury.

8
00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:32.510
He's come to Google today to talk about rejuvenating bone marrow and it's

9
00:00:32.511 --> 00:00:35.210
significant opportunity to combat aging.

10
00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:40.190
He also just might live forever.
A Dr Mark Ketta.
Koski everyone

11
00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.110
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

12
00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:50.620
<v 0>thanks John.
Thanks for coming today.
Um,
so yeah,
my name's mark.</v>

13
00:00:50.621 --> 00:00:53.140
Had a Koski.
That's,
that's my first birthday there.
Um,

14
00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.660
and I'm the president of forever labs.
Uh,
we're a longevity company as John said,

15
00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.610
and we're based in Ann Arbor,
Michigan.

16
00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:02.730
I'm currently are out here in mountain view though cause we're in the summer

17
00:01:02.731 --> 00:01:06.690
class of,
of y Combinator.
And so we've been,

18
00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.430
but we've been operational for about a year and a half.
Uh,
we started,
um,
my aunt.

19
00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:13.440
Yeah,
I bank.
And so what we do is we,

20
00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.420
we bank adult stem cells and then cryo preserve them for future therapy.

21
00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.960
And we also are working on developing some of these therapies,
uh,

22
00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.540
for which to use these cells in.
And so I'm going to,

23
00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.440
I'm going to kind of talk about what we're doing and why we think it's a good

24
00:01:28.441 --> 00:01:31.710
time to do it and why we've,
we've made decided to,
uh,

25
00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.970
disrupt our lives and,
and make this happen.
Um,
and also,

26
00:01:35.971 --> 00:01:38.760
but I'm going to talk about kind of the greater context that we're doing with
it.

27
00:01:38.761 --> 00:01:39.930
And I think,
uh,

28
00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.010
I powerfully believe that there is a change coming in in healthcare and how we

29
00:01:44.011 --> 00:01:48.690
provide medical services.
And I'm going to talk about what I see happening,

30
00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.360
what's happened,
what's happening now,
and where things are going

31
00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.240
in addition to that.
So I've kind of structured this talk,
uh,
as,

32
00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:57.510
as kind of like the arc of my,

33
00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:02.280
my own scientific career for the last 15 years because what I've been doing

34
00:02:02.281 --> 00:02:07.080
largely reflects,
uh,
my thoughts on what should be done and,
and,

35
00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.490
uh,
so I'm gonna talk about that.
And so that's kind of like the the,

36
00:02:11.491 --> 00:02:14.910
and then at the end I just wanna kind of white wax philosophical about,
uh,

37
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.610
about the space in general and what it means to,

38
00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:21.510
to actually have long been a longevity company.
So first,

39
00:02:21.511 --> 00:02:25.560
first I want to talk about is uh,
an issue we don't like to think about too much.

40
00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:31.170
So how do we die
after?

41
00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.460
So after about Middle Age,
in middle age we start to die of,
of,

42
00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:40.200
of causes that are quite similarly related.
They're called age related diseases.

43
00:02:40.201 --> 00:02:43.650
And so that's heart disease and the number one killer in cancer,

44
00:02:43.651 --> 00:02:46.200
which is a number two,
if you put them all together and stroke and,

45
00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:49.900
and lung disease,
dementia and a,

46
00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.650
all these there age related diseases and all of these diseases,

47
00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:57.210
what they have in common is they are caused by a dysfunction at the cellular

48
00:02:57.211 --> 00:02:59.860
level,
which leads to dysfunction at the tissue level,

49
00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:04.090
which leads to systemic failure.
And so you,
you know,

50
00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:07.750
you have some like a blood clot that goes to the brain and it builds up a blood

51
00:03:07.751 --> 00:03:10.420
clot,
goes the brain and you have this,
the stroke.
That's a,
the atria,

52
00:03:10.421 --> 00:03:13.570
the disease or in cancer you have cellular to some lunch and that leads to

53
00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:16.720
tumorigenesis and then you get a develop this cancer.

54
00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:19.180
And we've actually,

55
00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:22.600
so when I was putting this data together though,

56
00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:26.390
I noticed something interesting that traffic accidents,
can I surprise me?

57
00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:29.420
15 to 24,
25 to 35.
Um,

58
00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:32.230
traffic accidents are really leading cause of death in the youth.

59
00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:36.630
And I think that if we can get cars that drive better than we do a,

60
00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:39.820
then we're going to have some serious improvements in health care for youth.

61
00:03:39.821 --> 00:03:42.930
So somebody should work on that.
Um,

62
00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:46.870
but so we die by age related disease.

63
00:03:46.871 --> 00:03:49.810
Now we have the privilege to do that because I'm going to move to some,

64
00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:53.590
so this is,
this is cancer incidents in the United States.

65
00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:56.320
And you can see as you get older,

66
00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:01.400
your chances of getting cancer go up dramatically.
And we know why that is.

67
00:04:01.401 --> 00:04:05.520
That's because when you get older,
you've accumulated more,
uh,
just mute,

68
00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:07.550
more mutations,
more damage in your cells,

69
00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:11.240
and they start to build up and you get a cascading effect.

70
00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:15.950
And what also happens at this time in life is that you start to have a decline

71
00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:17.770
in your immune function.
Your,

72
00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:21.230
your immune system does not survey for cancer,

73
00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:26.000
for a tumor jet for two third pre cancerous tissue.
And as well as it used to.

74
00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:29.270
And the immune system plays a very important role in preventing camp tumor,

75
00:04:29.271 --> 00:04:32.150
genesis and cancer.
And interestingly,

76
00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:35.570
so in the last hundred or so years,

77
00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:38.850
or if you go back more than a hundred years ago,
rather,
um,
cancer,

78
00:04:38.851 --> 00:04:41.660
it wasn't something many people got the chance to experience because we would

79
00:04:41.661 --> 00:04:45.830
die of infection or we would die in childbirth.

80
00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:51.890
And cancer is a fairly new disease in the sense that we have through antibiotics

81
00:04:51.891 --> 00:04:55.420
and,
and,
and better,
um,
early healthcare.
Uh,

82
00:04:55.460 --> 00:05:00.460
we've been able to live to this point where we start to fall apart and we

83
00:05:00.561 --> 00:05:04.760
develop cancer so we fall apart.

84
00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:06.680
<v 1>Okay.</v>

85
00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:10.760
<v 0>And that's age related disease.
So what are we doing about it?</v>

86
00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:15.440
What are we doing about it right now?
Well.
So what,

87
00:05:15.441 --> 00:05:18.110
what does health care right now,
if you look,

88
00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:22.330
I looked in the Oxford English dictionary and health care was first used.

89
00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:25.310
It's pretty new term.
It was used by the US government,

90
00:05:25.311 --> 00:05:28.960
a pamphlet called a health care for children and about 1940 and,

91
00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:32.990
and then the deer definition that I found in the Webster Merriam Webster

92
00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:37.250
Dictionary was the maintenance and improvement of physical and mental health,

93
00:05:37.251 --> 00:05:39.920
especially through the provision of medical services.

94
00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:45.140
So the maintenance,
improvement of physical health,
mental health.

95
00:05:45.141 --> 00:05:46.820
So I take issue with that.

96
00:05:46.821 --> 00:05:50.150
I don't think that's a very good definition for healthcare,

97
00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:53.120
at least as we practice it.
So,

98
00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:56.450
and I'll tell you why we spend in the United States,

99
00:05:56.451 --> 00:06:01.451
90% of our healthcare funding goes towards the treatment of age related disease.

100
00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:07.250
So not any percent goes towards this point where we have a dysfunction and it's

101
00:06:07.251 --> 00:06:10.340
actually,
I would argue,
we spend our money on the restoration of health,

102
00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:12.530
medicare spending in United States.

103
00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:15.200
And to illustrate that Medicare spending in the United States,

104
00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:20.420
30% of Medicare spending goes to just 5% of the business beneficiaries that are

105
00:06:20.421 --> 00:06:23.270
going to die this year,
um,
in any given year.

106
00:06:23.271 --> 00:06:26.270
So 30% goes to the 5% that is dying in that year.
And,

107
00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:31.540
and of that 30% of the Medicare for spending a third of that actually goes to

108
00:06:31.731 --> 00:06:34.820
those,
those,
those people in those patients in the last month of life.

109
00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:39.920
And so what I think what more accurately describes what health care's today is

110
00:06:39.921 --> 00:06:43.580
an attempt to restore health that's been lost and not a very rational attempt

111
00:06:43.581 --> 00:06:46.130
because the more desperate the fight gets more desperate,
the battle,

112
00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:49.400
the more money,
the more resources we plow into it.
And it,

113
00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:53.180
especially in the last month of life,
when,
when a problem's almost retractable,

114
00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:58.250
that's when we put the most resources into,
into this.
And that,

115
00:06:58.460 --> 00:06:59.750
I think is what healthcare is today.

116
00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:03.800
I think this definition actually better defines what healthcare is going to be

117
00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:04.753
in the future.

118
00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:10.910
I say that because we are developing technologies that are enabling us to work

119
00:07:10.911 --> 00:07:15.620
with our biology in very subtle ways to actually do maintenance and improvement

120
00:07:15.621 --> 00:07:18.200
on a cellular level.
And by doing so,

121
00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:21.350
we're able to prevent the dysfunction of cells.
Um,

122
00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:26.150
and we're also able to actually sometimes undo some dysfunction in cells and

123
00:07:26.151 --> 00:07:29.450
restore the health on the cellular level.
And if you can do that,

124
00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:30.590
if you can do that,

125
00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:34.910
well then you don't have system failure or you can prevent systems failure and

126
00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:39.940
you have an economic incentive to put money up front where you can do a lot of,

127
00:07:41.521 --> 00:07:42.650
of good with little money.

128
00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:46.820
And the Axon economics are absolutely gonna just drive this transition from,

129
00:07:46.970 --> 00:07:48.590
from this disease treatment,

130
00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:52.430
a type of healthcare that we have now to a maintenance of health type of

131
00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:55.260
healthcare that we're going to have.
And so,
like I said,

132
00:07:55.261 --> 00:07:58.550
I'm going to talk about my experience and how I've come to this,

133
00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:01.250
how I've come to the,
you know,
where I'm at in federal lab.

134
00:08:01.251 --> 00:08:04.340
It's why we're providing the service we are.
And,
and,
and,
uh,

135
00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:07.730
with my own scientific,
you know,
kind of story.

136
00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:13.520
So it starts 15 years ago in 2001,
I had just graduated,

137
00:08:13.521 --> 00:08:18.521
I got my bachelor's in physics and I was a little burned out protocoling fortran

138
00:08:19.010 --> 00:08:22.880
and I wanted to get my hands dirty and I want to do some science where I love to

139
00:08:22.881 --> 00:08:25.430
work with my hands.
I'm going to do some science where I could,
I could,
you know,

140
00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:29.250
do some more experimental stuff.
And at that time I was introduced to a,

141
00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:33.380
a scientist,
he was a professor of physics actually that turned biologist,

142
00:08:33.590 --> 00:08:37.690
but he's also,
I was a,
is a very prim preeminent stroke researcher.
His name's uh,

143
00:08:37.730 --> 00:08:39.920
Michael Chop and you know that lab,

144
00:08:39.950 --> 00:08:43.730
he was the vice chair of neurology and Henry Ford,
Henry Ford Hospital,

145
00:08:43.731 --> 00:08:47.540
Michigan and Detroit.
And I sat down with him.

146
00:08:47.541 --> 00:08:51.590
He was looking at bringing on graduate students and he told me what they were

147
00:08:51.591 --> 00:08:53.990
doing,
their lab is,

148
00:08:54.170 --> 00:08:58.920
they were working on new treatments to first stroke,
new therapies for stroke.

149
00:08:59.490 --> 00:09:01.410
And you're gonna have to bear with me cause I'm talking a bit about stroke here

150
00:09:01.411 --> 00:09:02.244
because,

151
00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:07.310
but stroke I think as as is an age related disease a lot do I say do stroke is

152
00:09:07.771 --> 00:09:08.790
like how we use to treat it,

153
00:09:08.791 --> 00:09:11.440
how we're trying to treat it now and how we can treat in the future.
Um,

154
00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:15.750
applies to other age related diseases.
This is my own personal experience.

155
00:09:15.751 --> 00:09:19.080
This is how I got to where I'm at today.
And so,
uh,
Michael,

156
00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:23.010
he described me the current state of stroke treatment and that was there was one

157
00:09:23.011 --> 00:09:25.410
drug,
one FDA approved treatment for the stroke.

158
00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:29.250
It was a pro approved a five years prior to that.
It's called TPA.

159
00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:32.250
And it's simply just is an enzyme.
It's tissue.

160
00:09:32.251 --> 00:09:34.830
Plasminogen activator is simply the enzyme that dissolves the clot.

161
00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:35.940
When you have a stroke,

162
00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:40.830
87% of strokes are ischemic and you need dissolve this clot because the clot

163
00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:42.450
blocks blood flow to the brain.

164
00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:45.900
The brain needs a lot of energy and a lot of oxygen and dies very quickly.

165
00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:50.310
And so tpa simply says it dissolves the clot.
Um,
and,
and,

166
00:09:50.311 --> 00:09:51.270
and to save the brain.

167
00:09:51.271 --> 00:09:55.980
But TPA has a very serious too serious limitations.
One,

168
00:09:56.250 --> 00:10:01.250
you've got to get it quick because you're spraying dies quickly and to tpa

169
00:10:01.411 --> 00:10:04.730
because of its mechanism,
action can turn a ischemic,

170
00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:07.860
a blood clot stroke into what we call hemorrhagic stroke where you get a brain

171
00:10:07.861 --> 00:10:09.510
bleed and you've just exacerbated the problem.

172
00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:14.640
And at that time in 2001 about 5% of patients are eligible actually be who

173
00:10:14.641 --> 00:10:15.900
helped by this drug.
We're getting it.

174
00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:20.010
And so this is the third leading cause of death.
And you know,

175
00:10:20.370 --> 00:10:24.870
we had,
we could maybe help 5% of people that were having this.

176
00:10:25.930 --> 00:10:28.290
Um,
and so what Michael was working on,

177
00:10:28.890 --> 00:10:33.810
he told me is they were working on could they treat stroke after this phase.

178
00:10:34.470 --> 00:10:39.450
We knew at the time we,
we know that that after he brings has injury,

179
00:10:39.451 --> 00:10:42.630
it does heal itself to an extent.
There is a production of new neurons,

180
00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:46.440
there is new blood vessel growth,
there is induction of neuroplasticity,

181
00:10:46.441 --> 00:10:48.780
which means you're the neurons that do exist.

182
00:10:48.780 --> 00:10:51.330
They start to make new connections and try to compensate for the loss.

183
00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:53.730
And Michael said,
well,
if we can,
if we can improve that,

184
00:10:53.970 --> 00:10:57.600
if we can improve that natural ability for the brand to heal itself,

185
00:10:57.660 --> 00:11:00.630
then we have something that we could at least treat everybody that survives a

186
00:11:00.631 --> 00:11:03.660
stroke.
And,
and the way they did that,

187
00:11:03.661 --> 00:11:05.700
the way they were looking and starting at that time was they were looking at

188
00:11:05.701 --> 00:11:09.150
stem cells.
And I'm sure everybody's heard of what a stem cell is,

189
00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:12.810
but the definition of what stem cells,
it's just,

190
00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:14.880
it's a cell that can do two things,
two important things,

191
00:11:14.881 --> 00:11:19.560
one divide almost indefinitely.
I don't know if you've heard of,
uh,
of telomeres,

192
00:11:19.561 --> 00:11:22.800
but at the end of your DNA,
after the salad vision,

193
00:11:22.801 --> 00:11:25.860
your DNA will get shorter and shorter and shorter and a normal cell until the

194
00:11:25.861 --> 00:11:30.360
cell malfunctions and dies.
But stem cells express an enzyme called telomerase,

195
00:11:30.361 --> 00:11:33.510
which will extend the telomeres on the cells and they can divide almost

196
00:11:33.511 --> 00:11:35.040
indefinitely.
And the other,

197
00:11:35.130 --> 00:11:37.650
the other important thing that stem cells can do is they can define multiple

198
00:11:37.651 --> 00:11:40.530
tissue types.
Um,
and I'm the one going to talk about,

199
00:11:40.531 --> 00:11:43.890
I'm gonna talk about one stem cell quite a bit is the Mesenchymal stem cell of

200
00:11:43.891 --> 00:11:45.950
the bone marrow and the Mesenchymal stem cell can,

201
00:11:46.060 --> 00:11:50.160
can differentiate into bone and cartilage and muscle.
And um,

202
00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:54.280
and so that's what makes it a stem cell there.

203
00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:57.970
But there's a third characteristic that doesn't define stem cells but something

204
00:11:57.971 --> 00:12:02.740
they generally have and that is that they have a powerful influence on the

205
00:12:02.741 --> 00:12:06.010
tissue around them.
Um,
typically what that means,

206
00:12:06.011 --> 00:12:09.670
especially in this context of injury,
it means they can,
they can promote healing,

207
00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:14.590
they can regulate inflammation so it's appropriate and they can also,

208
00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:18.090
they can recruit,
you know,
new blood vessel growth.
Um,

209
00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:22.030
and so that's why they were looking at stem cells to improve the healing after

210
00:12:22.031 --> 00:12:25.630
stroke and assigned cell stem cell they were looking at was this Mesenchymal

211
00:12:25.631 --> 00:12:27.550
stem cell.
And actually I'll say we are looking at,

212
00:12:27.551 --> 00:12:31.120
because that's what I decided to join the lab and get to work with this and a

213
00:12:31.121 --> 00:12:35.980
Mesenchymal stem cell was,
we chose that for two reasons.

214
00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:39.820
One,
you have a lot of them.
The adult body has a lot of Mesenchymal stem cells.

215
00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:41.680
They're in your bone marrow.
Three easy to collect.

216
00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:45.550
They're very easy to expand to large numbers,
therapeutic numbers.
But two,

217
00:12:46.090 --> 00:12:49.150
they have a very powerful influence upon tissue around them.

218
00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:51.720
Mesenchymal stem cells make copious amounts of,

219
00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:55.600
of soluble factors that will decrease inflammation and promote regeneration.

220
00:12:56.230 --> 00:12:59.290
And so that's why we were looking at can we use these cells to treat stroke

221
00:13:00.460 --> 00:13:01.293
after it happened?

222
00:13:02.050 --> 00:13:05.750
And we started and we did these experiments where we found we could grow,

223
00:13:05.770 --> 00:13:10.030
hasn't came old,
hasn't kind stem cells and treat mice or rats with them.

224
00:13:11.230 --> 00:13:14.890
And we got what we thought were pretty amazing results.

225
00:13:14.891 --> 00:13:18.880
So we treated these animals just intravenously,

226
00:13:18.910 --> 00:13:23.080
just injecting the Mesenchymal stem cells into the bloodstream after the stroke

227
00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:26.980
and those animals that are treated.
Uh,
so after they had the stroke,

228
00:13:26.981 --> 00:13:28.570
they have this,
you know,
motor deficits,

229
00:13:28.571 --> 00:13:30.910
they would lose function and they would also have cognitive deficits that we

230
00:13:30.911 --> 00:13:33.100
could measure through a battery of tests.
And these cells,

231
00:13:33.220 --> 00:13:34.480
these animals that are treated with the cells,

232
00:13:34.750 --> 00:13:39.240
they would recover much more readily and they will recover,
uh,
much.
Uh,

233
00:13:39.490 --> 00:13:43.570
to a greater extent.
Then those animals that weren't treated in,
in,
in,
in,

234
00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:46.780
in coincident with that we would look in the brain and we would see an increase

235
00:13:46.781 --> 00:13:49.140
in new neurons.
Um,
after the treatment,
um,

236
00:13:49.450 --> 00:13:53.470
we would see a increase in synaptic plasticity even far away and the

237
00:13:53.471 --> 00:13:56.750
contralateral part of the brain,
this Mesenchymal stem cell treatment,
um,

238
00:13:56.830 --> 00:14:01.420
improve the plasticity and learning of the injured rat and we'd see a blood

239
00:14:01.421 --> 00:14:06.280
vessel growth,
smaller scar in the brain.
So this was,
this was exciting.

240
00:14:06.490 --> 00:14:07.580
We had this,
um,

241
00:14:07.990 --> 00:14:10.470
we developed this thing that maybe we could treat more and more people with and

242
00:14:10.510 --> 00:14:14.740
other labs took interest and started to do this and actually repeat our results

243
00:14:14.741 --> 00:14:19.090
and,
and um,
and things move from there.
Okay.

244
00:14:19.091 --> 00:14:22.900
So thanks for bearing with me on stroke because I'm almost out of it.

245
00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:24.713
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

246
00:14:24.730 --> 00:14:25.750
<v 0>15 years later now.</v>

247
00:14:25.751 --> 00:14:30.400
So this is 15 years later and at last count there's 14 registered clinical

248
00:14:30.401 --> 00:14:34.030
trials using mesenchymal stem cell therapy for the treatment of stroke in
humans.

249
00:14:34.750 --> 00:14:37.390
And I highlighted too,
that I think are particularly interesting.

250
00:14:38.050 --> 00:14:42.340
One is this top one,
it's going on at Stanford or this doctor Gary Steinberg.

251
00:14:42.700 --> 00:14:45.370
He's taking the cells and his objective directly into the brain around the

252
00:14:45.371 --> 00:14:50.320
damage issue area and he's,
there's two things interesting with the trial.
One,

253
00:14:52.090 --> 00:14:52.520
there's a,

254
00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:56.560
there's people in this trial that got the treatment and they had hemi paralysis,

255
00:14:56.561 --> 00:14:59.890
they had loss of limb function and they actually were gaining limb function.

256
00:15:00.550 --> 00:15:03.520
The thing that makes it very interesting that to me is that he was treating

257
00:15:03.521 --> 00:15:06.940
these people sometimes six to 12 months out after the stroke happened and
that's,

258
00:15:06.970 --> 00:15:10.360
that's really chronic and often it's thought,
you know,
you can do,

259
00:15:10.570 --> 00:15:13.870
you can do some physical therapy and speech therapy and whatnot to try to

260
00:15:13.871 --> 00:15:15.220
recover,
but 12 months out,

261
00:15:15.580 --> 00:15:18.580
what you have then is often thought to be what you're going to get back and to

262
00:15:18.581 --> 00:15:20.620
be able to affect a change to that point is it's pretty stunning.

263
00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:23.520
And so they're moving on to the next phase.
And then this third,
this,

264
00:15:23.540 --> 00:15:26.500
there's other trial here is going on in South Korea and I highlighted it for two

265
00:15:26.501 --> 00:15:29.320
reasons.
One,
it's phase three,
so it's pretty far along.
Um,

266
00:15:29.980 --> 00:15:34.570
but the other is that,
uh,
they're doing something interesting with the cells,

267
00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:37.450
which kind of illustrates what can be done.

268
00:15:37.810 --> 00:15:40.270
So one thing we found early on in our,

269
00:15:40.330 --> 00:15:45.130
in our work is that we found if you prep the,
uh,
Mesenchymal stem cell,

270
00:15:45.131 --> 00:15:47.710
if we,
if we introduced the Mesenchymal stem cell to an injury area,

271
00:15:47.890 --> 00:15:49.060
it changes its behavior.

272
00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:52.980
And it upregulates is production of a lot of these factors that,

273
00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:56.830
that have pro healing.
And they are actually in there in a human trial.

274
00:15:56.890 --> 00:15:59.680
What they're doing is they're taking the cells and they're treating them,

275
00:15:59.890 --> 00:16:01.510
they're growing them out,
but at the same time,

276
00:16:01.511 --> 00:16:04.330
they're exposing them to the plasma of the stroke patient that they took them

277
00:16:04.331 --> 00:16:08.350
from and to prep this Alison kind of advance them and get them ready for the

278
00:16:08.351 --> 00:16:11.300
treatment.
So I thought that was pretty cool.
Um,
and,

279
00:16:11.350 --> 00:16:14.650
and this is actually not just stroke.

280
00:16:14.950 --> 00:16:18.940
A lot of labs recognize the therapeutic potential of Mesenchymal stem cells and

281
00:16:18.941 --> 00:16:20.080
been using them for the treatment of

282
00:16:21.820 --> 00:16:24.480
age related diseases like heart disease and bone and cartilage,

283
00:16:24.510 --> 00:16:26.980
neurological disease.
Um,
even other,

284
00:16:27.490 --> 00:16:29.790
I mean other neurological diseases like Alzheimer's,
um,

285
00:16:30.430 --> 00:16:33.400
we use it for traumatic brain injury too.
It's pretty good effect.

286
00:16:33.401 --> 00:16:35.960
There's a trial in Houston doing that.
Um,

287
00:16:36.430 --> 00:16:40.050
and so that's to say Mesenchymal stem cell therapy has really advanced and it's,

288
00:16:40.051 --> 00:16:42.430
it's really given options where there were a few

289
00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:45.393
<v 1>well</v>

290
00:16:45.970 --> 00:16:47.140
<v 0>but there's a problem.
Okay.</v>

291
00:16:47.230 --> 00:16:51.220
So and it's some problem we recognized pretty early and others did too.

292
00:16:51.221 --> 00:16:54.610
So we have these cells,
they've got this therapeutic potential but

293
00:16:56.110 --> 00:16:58.810
your stem cell numbers and function decline as you get older.

294
00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:02.920
So 10 years from now you're going to have less themselves and you have,

295
00:17:03.100 --> 00:17:07.400
and you've now and the ones that you do have are have less therapeutic potential

296
00:17:07.401 --> 00:17:09.340
whether it's going to have a decrease in function.

297
00:17:12.070 --> 00:17:14.980
The graph here on the left demonstrates this one study was looking at just

298
00:17:14.981 --> 00:17:18.820
counting the number of circulating blood progenitor cells and this vasculature

299
00:17:18.850 --> 00:17:22.720
vascular progeneter cells in,
in,
in the blood and just counting the number.

300
00:17:22.721 --> 00:17:24.040
And that decreases with donor age.

301
00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:27.130
There's an interesting study that's kind of related.

302
00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:31.570
The University of Messina and in Italy they took 80 year olds and they just

303
00:17:31.571 --> 00:17:35.230
counted the circulating stem cells in their blood and just kind of them.

304
00:17:35.231 --> 00:17:38.650
And then they revisited those individuals seven years later and they actually

305
00:17:38.651 --> 00:17:40.420
found that the number of stem cells,

306
00:17:40.421 --> 00:17:43.180
the concentration circulating in the blood was predictive of whether or not that

307
00:17:43.181 --> 00:17:44.860
individual is going to be alive seven years later.

308
00:17:45.130 --> 00:17:48.840
And they said that that might be an interesting predict biomarker for.

309
00:17:50.230 --> 00:17:52.590
Um,
the graph on the right here,

310
00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:55.410
we've got mesenchymal stem cells and we're just looking at the bone building

311
00:17:55.650 --> 00:17:57.930
potential to sell.
As I said,
they can build bone,

312
00:17:58.380 --> 00:17:59.740
they can become bone building cells and,

313
00:17:59.940 --> 00:18:02.640
and that decreases that potential decreases with age.

314
00:18:05.460 --> 00:18:10.080
Here's another showing Mesenchymal stem cell,
um,
decline with age.

315
00:18:10.081 --> 00:18:13.230
This is just looking at perforation of the cells.
Uh,
this top line,

316
00:18:13.231 --> 00:18:14.820
this graph is just using,
growing.

317
00:18:14.821 --> 00:18:16.590
This is just growing them in culture and seeing how fast,

318
00:18:16.591 --> 00:18:17.610
how readily they cliff rate.

319
00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:22.200
And you've got two to 12 year old child cells and they grow quite readily to

320
00:18:22.201 --> 00:18:24.810
great numbers and you can expand the [inaudible].
They're exponential growth.

321
00:18:24.811 --> 00:18:28.380
You can get a lots and lots of cells,
like really you can,

322
00:18:28.410 --> 00:18:32.970
I mean a pound of cells from,
from that so many.
Um,
and,

323
00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:37.380
but if you look down at the bottom line,
uh,
that's those older donors,

324
00:18:37.410 --> 00:18:41.970
that's a 60 to 70 year old donors and they don't grow as quick and they don't

325
00:18:41.971 --> 00:18:43.770
grow as much.
And you can see after like nine passages,

326
00:18:43.771 --> 00:18:48.490
they just stop and we call that senescence.
Um,
you know,
if,

327
00:18:48.491 --> 00:18:52.680
if somebody gives me,
whether it's a mouse or a rat or a monkey or whatever,

328
00:18:52.681 --> 00:18:54.420
human cell,
Mesenchymal stem cell,

329
00:18:54.421 --> 00:18:56.370
and they've given me two different ones and they say they're for different ages.

330
00:18:56.370 --> 00:18:58.050
I can tell them really quick which one's which,

331
00:18:58.051 --> 00:19:02.040
because it's pretty stark striking the difference between the cells,
uh,

332
00:19:02.220 --> 00:19:06.450
functionality.
And so that's bad.
But this,
this,

333
00:19:06.451 --> 00:19:09.630
this turns to Senescence here,
this,
these were these old one stop.

334
00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:13.380
It's actually thought to be supposed to be beneficial thing too,

335
00:19:13.410 --> 00:19:17.760
because these cells have become damaged over time and a stem cell,

336
00:19:17.761 --> 00:19:21.690
because of its ability to divide infinitely and to influence the tissue around

337
00:19:21.691 --> 00:19:24.950
it,
it can be a risk factor for cancer.

338
00:19:24.970 --> 00:19:27.240
A lot of cancers are caused by stem cells gone awry.

339
00:19:27.540 --> 00:19:28.770
And so it's thought that this is an essence.

340
00:19:28.771 --> 00:19:31.200
What these cells will do is it'll slow down and they'll turn themselves off,

341
00:19:31.470 --> 00:19:32.700
often will just commit suicide.

342
00:19:33.870 --> 00:19:36.420
But often that actually they'll just kind of hang out too.

343
00:19:36.630 --> 00:19:39.780
And because they're just kind of given VAD and they go be like bad vibes,

344
00:19:39.790 --> 00:19:44.550
the tissue around it.
And actually,
um,
it's a,
it's a,
it's a problem.
Um,
so,

345
00:19:44.860 --> 00:19:48.210
all right,
so I was,
I was working in this stroke lab.

346
00:19:48.211 --> 00:19:51.810
We had this great therapy and it was,
you know,
maybe it's moving the clinic,

347
00:19:53.190 --> 00:19:56.240
but there's this problem,
the stem cells that we're using are,

348
00:19:56.490 --> 00:19:58.680
are declining and more than you're more likely to have a stroke.

349
00:19:58.710 --> 00:20:02.640
You all at your stem cells have,
have gone downhill.
And so,
uh,

350
00:20:02.641 --> 00:20:05.280
my buddy that was a colleague of mine and he's our chief science officer,

351
00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:08.400
Dr Ben Bowler and I,
we'd often talk about this stuff and we said,
well,

352
00:20:08.790 --> 00:20:10.940
we should do something about that.
That's,
you know,

353
00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:12.510
and there's something that you do really easy.

354
00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:14.790
You just like take them and send them forward in time.

355
00:20:14.791 --> 00:20:19.040
You just take young cells and you send them to your future self and,
and,

356
00:20:19.100 --> 00:20:22.590
and use them when you're old and that's easy and you don't even need Deloreans.

357
00:20:22.620 --> 00:20:26.580
You just do what we call is a Hetero chronic transplant.

358
00:20:26.581 --> 00:20:27.670
Don't mention medical oriented.

359
00:20:29.950 --> 00:20:34.050
So we do as a,
it's called a Hetero chronic transplantation.

360
00:20:34.170 --> 00:20:37.230
And so he just private preserve the cells.
We've been doing that for a long time.

361
00:20:37.231 --> 00:20:39.800
It's a matter of course in the lab.
Um,

362
00:20:39.930 --> 00:20:42.780
I've grown cells that are more than 40 years old.
Um,

363
00:20:43.650 --> 00:20:47.010
once at liquid nitrogen,
the cells are biologically inert as,

364
00:20:47.170 --> 00:20:49.450
as you freeze them carefully and as long as you of them carefully,

365
00:20:49.470 --> 00:20:51.790
the time in between,
it doesn't matter so much.
He actually,

366
00:20:51.791 --> 00:20:54.430
you start to think about background radiation if you want to keep them for a

367
00:20:54.431 --> 00:20:58.390
long time.
Um,
and there's been successful bone marrow transplants,

368
00:20:58.391 --> 00:21:01.510
one of the oldest stem cell therapies there is with cells that were frozen for

369
00:21:01.511 --> 00:21:04.120
more than 20 years.
So okay,
we can,

370
00:21:04.150 --> 00:21:07.800
we could take ourselves our young cells and freeze them for old herself.
Um,

371
00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:09.200
I want to talk to people about this one thing.

372
00:21:09.220 --> 00:21:12.790
The question that always get so is,
well,
why not allergenic?

373
00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:16.900
Why can't you just take someone else's young cells and just treat yourself?

374
00:21:17.290 --> 00:21:21.700
You don't have to even worry about that then.
Well,

375
00:21:21.730 --> 00:21:24.730
the answer to this,
this is immunity is crazy.
And the,
the,

376
00:21:24.750 --> 00:21:27.640
the complete answer to this is that if it's very complicated,
but,

377
00:21:27.790 --> 00:21:32.790
but a general answer to this is that your immunity is a unique and you have to

378
00:21:33.101 --> 00:21:37.930
overcome obstacles to,
to do this allergenic transfer.
Now there's a,

379
00:21:38.140 --> 00:21:39.180
on your six chromosome,

380
00:21:39.190 --> 00:21:44.190
there's this big cluster of about 250 genes that is called the Hla or the major

381
00:21:44.981 --> 00:21:49.690
histocompatibility complex.
And what it does is it says,
this is me.

382
00:21:49.810 --> 00:21:51.280
And if another cell expresses different,

383
00:21:51.281 --> 00:21:55.870
it says it's not me and your body tries to kill it.
If you want to regrow,

384
00:21:57.010 --> 00:22:01.240
regenerate tissue,
if you want to incorporate tissue longterm in your body,
um,

385
00:22:01.540 --> 00:22:04.840
you typically need your own cells or you need to modulate the immune response.

386
00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:08.770
And often that means immunosuppressants.
Well,

387
00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:10.600
so if you've heard in bone marrow donation,

388
00:22:10.601 --> 00:22:13.330
what they're doing is they're donating these hemopoietic stem cells that are in

389
00:22:13.331 --> 00:22:15.100
the bone marrow.
And there what you'll do is,

390
00:22:15.101 --> 00:22:18.280
and those actually are cells that give rise to immune system and what they'll do

391
00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:21.100
is for the recipient has to actually get the immune system wiped out.

392
00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:24.490
And then they will put in a new one and from the donor and they tried to get a

393
00:22:24.491 --> 00:22:27.370
perfect match,
but even then it runs a very high risk.
Um,

394
00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:31.090
and it's very dangerous because that immune system that comes in might recognize

395
00:22:31.091 --> 00:22:32.920
the recipient as the foreign body.

396
00:22:33.010 --> 00:22:35.770
And then you get this thing called graft versus host disease where the,

397
00:22:35.771 --> 00:22:39.430
the donors marrow attacks the recipient.
Um,
and it's,
it's very deadly.

398
00:22:39.730 --> 00:22:42.520
And so we'll take immune suppressants to prevent that same thing in Oregon

399
00:22:42.521 --> 00:22:43.990
donation.
Um,

400
00:22:44.290 --> 00:22:47.620
they people take immune suppressants and like I said,

401
00:22:47.650 --> 00:22:50.980
the immune system is very important for the prevention of cancer.

402
00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:55.150
And those people that have received our recipients of organ donation,

403
00:22:55.151 --> 00:22:58.780
they have a much higher incidence of cancer.
Uh,
you might remember those,

404
00:22:58.781 --> 00:23:00.520
like in France about five years ago,

405
00:23:00.521 --> 00:23:03.760
there was a first successful face transplant,
well that,
that woman actually,

406
00:23:03.761 --> 00:23:05.680
she died just recently of multiple cancers.

407
00:23:05.830 --> 00:23:10.510
She was on very high on powerful immune suppressant.
Um,
so,

408
00:23:10.540 --> 00:23:13.930
so it's not an ideal situation,
but to be honest,

409
00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:17.620
there's some ways you can get around it.
And there's some ways that we sometimes,

410
00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:21.700
so the Ma and I'll talk about the Mesenchymal stem cell because there are about

411
00:23:21.701 --> 00:23:25.420
one third of trials using mesenchymal stem cells are allergenic like this.

412
00:23:26.500 --> 00:23:28.960
And the reason was thinking the thinking was,
well,

413
00:23:28.961 --> 00:23:32.770
they don't express what this major histocompatibility complex number two,

414
00:23:32.771 --> 00:23:35.950
and they don't really tell the the recipient's body,
hey,

415
00:23:35.951 --> 00:23:40.130
the where we are foreign and so you can get this therapeutic effect.
Um,

416
00:23:40.900 --> 00:23:44.800
but what we've was more come to light and recently is that they actually,

417
00:23:44.801 --> 00:23:47.210
when you put them in the body,
they do start to express this,
this thing.

418
00:23:47.211 --> 00:23:49.460
And they get to us.
They don't realistic,
a big immune reaction,

419
00:23:49.461 --> 00:23:53.030
but they do get wiped out.
They do say disappear and um,

420
00:23:53.570 --> 00:23:58.500
kind of evidence of this.
So the,
the second,
the,
the trial at Sanford,
uh,

421
00:23:58.620 --> 00:23:59.241
that I mentioned,

422
00:23:59.241 --> 00:24:02.660
they're actually using allogenic cells and put it directly in the brain and they

423
00:24:02.661 --> 00:24:05.350
look two months later in the cells were gone.
Um,

424
00:24:05.351 --> 00:24:08.360
I'm not sure if they were the patient's own cells,
if they'd still be there.

425
00:24:08.361 --> 00:24:12.060
That would have to be tested,
but they were gone.
And it's,

426
00:24:12.380 --> 00:24:15.650
it begs a question where they have a more persistent,
um,

427
00:24:15.651 --> 00:24:17.840
could they have even got more if they,
if they use cells of the,

428
00:24:17.841 --> 00:24:21.230
of the patient's arm,
you just me.
Um,

429
00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:25.010
but definitely if you want to replace tissue,

430
00:24:25.310 --> 00:24:28.340
if you want to get new tissue,
you need your,

431
00:24:28.341 --> 00:24:30.500
your own cells are by far the best.

432
00:24:30.980 --> 00:24:34.450
And it's not so simple as just deleting this piece of,
of DNA.
Uh,

433
00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:37.630
there's a lot of non coding genes in there that are regulating things and it's,

434
00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:39.440
there's,
there's actually jeans in here.
They're important for,

435
00:24:39.620 --> 00:24:44.510
for infection and other,
other functions.
So nothing is generally that simple.

436
00:24:44.511 --> 00:24:49.200
So that's why not allergenic.
All right?

437
00:24:49.201 --> 00:24:50.034
So,

438
00:24:50.260 --> 00:24:51.093
<v 1>hmm,</v>

439
00:24:51.730 --> 00:24:54.610
<v 0>we talked about this and you could save your young cells,
but</v>

440
00:24:56.600 --> 00:25:01.230
you're a trained is age related disease,
right?
And you say a young cells and,
um,

441
00:25:02.130 --> 00:25:04.530
to treat something catastrophic happens later in life.

442
00:25:05.250 --> 00:25:09.450
But you know,
I've been to start a point that maybe this,

443
00:25:09.660 --> 00:25:11.460
maybe this stroke,
you know,
we know this,

444
00:25:11.461 --> 00:25:14.910
maybe the stroke isn't just because it doesn't,
we can,
we can attack it earlier.

445
00:25:14.911 --> 00:25:16.970
Like,
so when I was actually,
when I was talking to our CEO,

446
00:25:16.980 --> 00:25:19.650
when I was putting this slide together and talking about tpa,
now we still have,

447
00:25:19.651 --> 00:25:22.450
tpa is still the only one FDA approved drug for treat,

448
00:25:22.680 --> 00:25:25.050
for treatment stroking United States.
So this is 21 years later,

449
00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:28.170
and it's not for a lack of trying.
The,

450
00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:31.050
the n I n d s budget was a national institute.

451
00:25:31.080 --> 00:25:35.340
Neural disorder instruct budget last year was 1.7 billion.
Uh,
it's,
it's,

452
00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:39.660
um,
but he said yes.
He was like,
well,
what do we do?
And I said,

453
00:25:39.661 --> 00:25:43.200
just don't have a stroke.
It's a,
that's what you do.
And honestly,

454
00:25:43.201 --> 00:25:45.060
I think that that's what a bed and I,

455
00:25:45.120 --> 00:25:49.690
my colleague and I were starting to think like,
can we prevent this?
Can you get,

456
00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:50.593
get ahead of it.

457
00:25:52.510 --> 00:25:57.510
And there's a lot of similarities in age related disease and age related disease

458
00:25:59.081 --> 00:26:03.970
is not a fact of all life.
I think a lot of people just think life,
death,

459
00:26:04.540 --> 00:26:06.790
you know,
this is just part of the natural process,

460
00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:10.660
but they aren't two sides of the same coin.

461
00:26:12.500 --> 00:26:16.630
Amoeba is another singular cellular organisms.
They don't necessarily age.

462
00:26:17.080 --> 00:26:21.310
So an Amoeba,
when a device,
you don't have a young Amoeba and an old Amoeba,

463
00:26:21.670 --> 00:26:23.890
you have to have me.
But as they're the same age,

464
00:26:24.100 --> 00:26:27.320
they just maybe just get around the problem by just fixing damage faster.

465
00:26:27.321 --> 00:26:31.720
It happens.
They can fix the wear and tear of life faster than it occurs.
Um,

466
00:26:32.380 --> 00:26:34.720
and so let me,
it was really just like an ageless organism.

467
00:26:36.030 --> 00:26:39.790
Hydras um,
are also,
they're interesting.
They're a multicellular organism.

468
00:26:40.030 --> 00:26:43.860
And there's no increase in mortality,
uh,
with a hydro as,

469
00:26:43.861 --> 00:26:45.630
as time goes by and they're actually interesting.

470
00:26:45.630 --> 00:26:49.020
There is just chalk full of stem cells are almost like stem cell trees.
Um,

471
00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:52.500
and so there are these creatures that,
that don't experience aging,

472
00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:56.610
but multicellular organisms,
they tend to,

473
00:26:57.290 --> 00:26:58.350
but it does beg the question.

474
00:26:58.890 --> 00:27:00.850
And this is something that we were often talking about.
Do,

475
00:27:00.870 --> 00:27:04.140
what does this have to happen?
This is a client happen to happen.
If we could,

476
00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:09.050
if we could do like the Amoeba and we can do maintenance on a lowest,

477
00:27:09.110 --> 00:27:10.560
they'll sell you a level and it could,

478
00:27:10.561 --> 00:27:14.130
we prevent the aging process in humans.

479
00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:18.450
We do this in our cars.
I mean classic cars not far from our office in Anarbor.

480
00:27:18.451 --> 00:27:20.160
I can go to Henry Ford Museum and I can,

481
00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:23.850
I can take a ride in a model t that was built more than a hundred years ago.
Um,

482
00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:28.500
so anyway,
we're kicking around this problem.
We knew the cells that had to be,

483
00:27:28.740 --> 00:27:32.700
had to be saved for later because they were losing this important properties.

484
00:27:33.540 --> 00:27:37.110
Um,
and then,
uh,
this is 2012.

485
00:27:38.310 --> 00:27:43.110
We got this call,
we have this call for grants from the NIH.
This is grant,

486
00:27:43.111 --> 00:27:47.220
this call for applications.
And um,
when you're a researcher,

487
00:27:47.221 --> 00:27:51.450
you write a lot of light,
a lot of grants,
um,
that's your life.
And,

488
00:27:52.110 --> 00:27:56.190
and um,
it's a brutal process.
Uh,
when you writing grants,

489
00:27:56.191 --> 00:28:00.960
because half of the grants used submit aren't even discussed.
They're not even,

490
00:28:00.961 --> 00:28:04.230
they don't,
they get to the,
uh,
this,
you get it back and says,

491
00:28:04.231 --> 00:28:06.060
not discussed and so you're going to get feedback.

492
00:28:06.061 --> 00:28:08.160
You don't even know what was bad or it was good.
They just don't even,

493
00:28:08.280 --> 00:28:10.680
and so it's almost like you spend a month writing the grant,
doing research,

494
00:28:10.710 --> 00:28:13.520
and then you just pick it up and drop it in the waste Bin and they move forward.

495
00:28:13.610 --> 00:28:16.020
That's what the feeling.
Um,
so anyway,

496
00:28:16.170 --> 00:28:17.810
so we got this grant and this grant was funny.
It was,

497
00:28:17.820 --> 00:28:21.390
had give us your craziest idea.
You don't have to write a big,
a big proposal,

498
00:28:21.391 --> 00:28:24.540
just a short one or two pages.
It was like just your craziest idea.

499
00:28:24.541 --> 00:28:27.060
You're thinking of something that you wouldn't write a proposal on.

500
00:28:27.061 --> 00:28:31.500
Otherwise we want something that's,
you know,
kind of all bang.
And,

501
00:28:31.830 --> 00:28:36.120
and what we also saw,
Ben and I,
we often laughed at acronyms that scientists use.

502
00:28:36.350 --> 00:28:38.160
Um,
because we'll often,

503
00:28:38.161 --> 00:28:42.540
like you'll give acronyms to genes or proteins to explain like the first thing

504
00:28:42.541 --> 00:28:46.170
that we saw it too.
And then everybody finds other things that it does.

505
00:28:46.171 --> 00:28:48.150
And it confuses everybody because they,
they,
you know,

506
00:28:48.151 --> 00:28:51.810
they named it after something,
some functionality.
Anyway,

507
00:28:51.811 --> 00:28:54.950
this grand was called Eureka and that's actually an acronym.
It was,
um,

508
00:28:55.650 --> 00:28:59.520
it was extraordinary.
Um,
oh Geez,

509
00:28:59.530 --> 00:29:03.750
ex ex extraordinary,
um,
unconventional research,

510
00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:08.760
enabling knowledge acceleration.
And,
and we laughed at it.

511
00:29:08.820 --> 00:29:10.740
One thing,
there's,
it's not even grammatically correct.

512
00:29:10.741 --> 00:29:12.060
Like you can't accelerate knowledge.

513
00:29:12.061 --> 00:29:13.470
You can accelerate the acquisition of knowledge,

514
00:29:13.471 --> 00:29:15.320
but like that's like throwing a book,
you know,
it just like,

515
00:29:15.480 --> 00:29:19.680
it doesn't make sense.
So,
so,
so we were like,
well,
that's great.

516
00:29:19.681 --> 00:29:24.340
Let's do this idea.
Let's,
let's use young cells and we'll try to trade.

517
00:29:24.350 --> 00:29:25.260
He aging itself,

518
00:29:25.261 --> 00:29:28.320
like we know that there's a decline in the cellular niche and the,

519
00:29:28.321 --> 00:29:31.590
and the bone marrow niche.
And So said the stem cell niche.
And so we said,

520
00:29:31.591 --> 00:29:34.770
what if we just simply take these young mscs and we take genetically mine

521
00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:36.180
genetically match mice,
which you can do.

522
00:29:36.181 --> 00:29:38.790
And we take young ones and we come to old ones and will they,

523
00:29:39.030 --> 00:29:41.740
will they have increased health span?
Um,
if we,

524
00:29:41.830 --> 00:29:44.740
if we prevent the decline of the Niche,
William increased lifespan.

525
00:29:45.010 --> 00:29:49.030
And so we submitted this proposal to this Eureka grant and probably you probably

526
00:29:49.031 --> 00:29:49.660
not the best idea.

527
00:29:49.660 --> 00:29:52.960
We decide to come up with a worst acronym and we called it battery.

528
00:29:52.961 --> 00:29:56.830
We call it bone marrow,
autologous transplantation,
helping the old regain youth.

529
00:29:57.220 --> 00:30:01.780
And if you're a student of history,
a lady bathroom was a homicidal,

530
00:30:01.781 --> 00:30:05.830
a Hungarian Nobel woman that when bathed in the blood of a young victims this
to,

531
00:30:05.831 --> 00:30:07.390
to live forever.
So,
so

532
00:30:10.030 --> 00:30:14.050
you can tell her starting to get burned out at this point in my career.
Um,
so,

533
00:30:14.380 --> 00:30:18.210
so whether by our,
our,
we did actually,
we didn't actually get,
um,

534
00:30:18.250 --> 00:30:22.210
and it was discussed,
let's do it.
Um,
and so,
but we didn't get the grant,

535
00:30:22.211 --> 00:30:24.400
we didn't get the grant,
and maybe that was her sense of humor that prevented it.

536
00:30:24.630 --> 00:30:26.860
Um,
but interesting.
Yeah.
One of the things too,

537
00:30:27.210 --> 00:30:29.680
I'll never forget the review of that grant because one of the,

538
00:30:29.710 --> 00:30:33.700
one of the reviewers said that our,
our idea didn't use enough technology.

539
00:30:34.360 --> 00:30:35.350
And I thought,
you know,

540
00:30:35.351 --> 00:30:38.980
what does that even mean if you take something that you have,

541
00:30:38.981 --> 00:30:41.440
if you take everything you have and you use it in a new way,

542
00:30:41.441 --> 00:30:44.830
that's the definition of innovation.
But they weren't interested in it.

543
00:30:45.010 --> 00:30:49.280
I guess we have to shut up for lasers on it.
Um,

544
00:30:49.630 --> 00:30:52.420
so in researching this grant though,

545
00:30:52.660 --> 00:30:54.670
we came across something and that was really interesting to me.

546
00:30:55.090 --> 00:30:56.720
So at the University of Texas,
in Arlington,

547
00:30:56.721 --> 00:30:59.590
there was a group and they asked a very similar question.

548
00:30:59.620 --> 00:31:01.540
They were looking at bone,
but they said,

549
00:31:01.541 --> 00:31:05.150
what if we use young bone marrow cell mesenchymal stem cells and we transplant

550
00:31:05.151 --> 00:31:09.640
to these two,
told her mice,
um,
how would they fare?
Would they have,

551
00:31:09.670 --> 00:31:12.430
because they're looking to osteoporosis,
the loss of bone density over time.

552
00:31:12.730 --> 00:31:15.880
And they said,
would this prevent the onset of osteoporosis or slow it down?

553
00:31:16.060 --> 00:31:18.550
And they found indeed it did slow it down.
Um,
when they,

554
00:31:18.580 --> 00:31:20.240
when they did this and these are genetically matched mine,

555
00:31:20.250 --> 00:31:24.440
so it's kind of like a twin kind of transplant and um,
but it's,

556
00:31:24.560 --> 00:31:27.070
there's a surprise serendipitously.
They also found that the mice,

557
00:31:27.071 --> 00:31:31.840
that they transplant them to live longer and they did an age match,

558
00:31:32.050 --> 00:31:33.250
um,
transplant as well.

559
00:31:33.251 --> 00:31:37.000
They took old mscs and give him the old mice and they didn't live longer.

560
00:31:37.001 --> 00:31:40.000
And so that said,
the youthfulness of the cells was,
was it was important to this,

561
00:31:40.150 --> 00:31:44.110
to this effect and that really started to,
to eat,
eat,
chew away at me.
I was like,

562
00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:48.820
this is something that,
um,
you know,
we should be pursuing.

563
00:31:48.821 --> 00:31:50.830
This is something that's worth looking into more.

564
00:31:51.520 --> 00:31:54.400
And then a year after we got the grant rejected,

565
00:31:54.401 --> 00:31:57.310
there was another group that just said whole bone marrow,
young,

566
00:31:57.311 --> 00:32:00.490
whole bone marrow and transplanting it to older genetically match mice and those

567
00:32:00.491 --> 00:32:04.210
mice,
they reported live longer.
And,
and that was about it.
I was,

568
00:32:04.450 --> 00:32:08.560
I was on a phone call with,
um,
some business minded friends,

569
00:32:08.561 --> 00:32:12.520
our CEO Steve here.
And,
um,
I said,
you know,
I'm,

570
00:32:12.980 --> 00:32:15.730
I'm not mad.
I didn't get the grant,
I'm not mad,
I ain't get the first paper,

571
00:32:15.731 --> 00:32:19.650
but I'm turning 40 this year.
Um,
I want to store myself.

572
00:32:19.651 --> 00:32:22.570
It's like I want to put myself aside.
And he said,
well,

573
00:32:22.571 --> 00:32:24.160
that something I'd like to do too.

574
00:32:24.520 --> 00:32:28.450
And we started to talk about it and one thing led to another and we,

575
00:32:28.590 --> 00:32:31.040
so we met with an orthopedic surgeon,
um,

576
00:32:31.060 --> 00:32:35.440
who's now our chief medical officer award,
ween orthopedic surgeon.
And he said,

577
00:32:35.441 --> 00:32:39.130
you know what,
I'm already taking bone marrow.
He's like already doing pulmonary.

578
00:32:39.620 --> 00:32:41.930
But they do is they'll take it out and we'll concentrate it and then we'll

579
00:32:41.931 --> 00:32:45.710
inject it at the site of injury or after our surgery to promote healing.

580
00:32:46.310 --> 00:32:50.990
And so we realized there was an on ramp for this idea.
And now,

581
00:32:50.991 --> 00:32:53.510
so what we're doing,
here's Steve.
He's,
he was the third person to bank.

582
00:32:54.490 --> 00:32:57.440
That was number two and number one was our CSO cause he's hockey player.

583
00:32:58.520 --> 00:33:02.360
And here's Steve.
He's like,
just,
yeah,
I had it done.
Um,
it's really,

584
00:33:02.450 --> 00:33:06.840
really pretty minor.
And so our,
our,
what we do now is we credential,
um,

585
00:33:07.130 --> 00:33:11.510
orthopedic surgeons,
sports medicine and plastic surgeons generally.

586
00:33:11.780 --> 00:33:14.270
And the do this,
this bone marrow aspiration and collection is,
it's,

587
00:33:14.271 --> 00:33:14.931
it's pretty simple.

588
00:33:14.931 --> 00:33:17.780
It's outpatient in and out in 15 minutes and you got your stem cells.

589
00:33:17.781 --> 00:33:22.610
But we keep those.
But,
um,
and so we,
we,
we did this,

590
00:33:22.611 --> 00:33:25.760
we went operational and we're 15 months ago and now we're in,

591
00:33:25.820 --> 00:33:27.710
we're in seven states.
Um,

592
00:33:29.900 --> 00:33:34.310
and so there's more to it though.
So we're not just collecting,

593
00:33:34.700 --> 00:33:36.410
we're actually doing the experiment we wanted to do.

594
00:33:36.710 --> 00:33:38.440
We're running that right now.
Um,

595
00:33:38.630 --> 00:33:41.420
we're doing the heterokaryon lung transplantation of,
of old,

596
00:33:41.570 --> 00:33:45.470
of young mscs to older mice and we're going to see if it improves their health

597
00:33:45.471 --> 00:33:47.650
span because we're neurologist.
Um,

598
00:33:47.750 --> 00:33:51.230
we're looking at also their cognitive health as well and we're going to see if

599
00:33:51.231 --> 00:33:56.210
we can slow the onset of cognitive decline.
Um,
and so it's really,
I'm,

600
00:33:56.211 --> 00:33:59.750
I'm,
I'm excited to find out whether we can make this work and if we can make it

601
00:33:59.751 --> 00:34:01.580
work,
can we improve upon it?

602
00:34:03.770 --> 00:34:05.870
One of the issues when you're dealing with,
with,

603
00:34:05.930 --> 00:34:09.560
with therapy is you always have dose and delivery.

604
00:34:10.220 --> 00:34:13.070
You need the therapy to go where it needs to work,

605
00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:15.410
not where it doesn't and you need it to go there.

606
00:34:15.411 --> 00:34:19.400
And a therapeutically effective dose.
And I mentioned,
you know,

607
00:34:19.401 --> 00:34:23.090
there's a number of really interesting technologies or working on rejuvenating

608
00:34:23.091 --> 00:34:24.830
cellular cells and the cellular level.

609
00:34:25.400 --> 00:34:28.700
And when we had the cells outside the body,

610
00:34:28.910 --> 00:34:31.640
we have an opportunity to work on them,
which are much higher fidelity.

611
00:34:31.850 --> 00:34:35.000
And we're also pursuing this that we can not only just take out the cells,

612
00:34:35.150 --> 00:34:36.530
young cells and giving you a older,

613
00:34:36.620 --> 00:34:39.660
but in the intermediate we might be able to improve upon them,
um,

614
00:34:39.760 --> 00:34:42.980
incorrect damage.
Um,
so that's,
that's where we're doing.

615
00:34:42.981 --> 00:34:47.510
That's where we're headed.
Um,
and so on a personal level,

616
00:34:48.590 --> 00:34:50.210
I made the transition,
you know,

617
00:34:50.690 --> 00:34:55.280
about a year or so ago from a lab grant funded scientists to,
to,
you know,

618
00:34:55.281 --> 00:35:00.020
somebody starting a longevity startup and,
and you know,

619
00:35:00.021 --> 00:35:02.810
it was brought on by what I was seeing happening and,
and,
and,

620
00:35:02.811 --> 00:35:06.620
but it was also brought on by something that's very,
I feel very powerful.

621
00:35:07.070 --> 00:35:09.020
This is,
this is a problem.
I,

622
00:35:09.210 --> 00:35:13.280
we share a problem that we don't talk about even though it's like,

623
00:35:14.120 --> 00:35:18.140
it really defines so much of our culture and that problem.

624
00:35:18.200 --> 00:35:21.830
The way I see it is that we have what it feels like in a mortal consciousness.

625
00:35:22.040 --> 00:35:24.710
But we have a mortal body.
We feel like we should live forever,

626
00:35:24.711 --> 00:35:26.830
but our bodies don't.
And

627
00:35:28.340 --> 00:35:31.880
my grandmother in three days,
she's going to turn 92.
I've got one left,

628
00:35:31.881 --> 00:35:36.590
his grandparents and um,
she said to me like a year ago,
she said,

629
00:35:36.930 --> 00:35:40.820
mark,
I feel like the same person I was when I was 18.
I feel like that the,

630
00:35:40.960 --> 00:35:44.280
and she said,
where'd the time go?
She said,
you know,
what happened?

631
00:35:44.820 --> 00:35:45.990
And to be honest,

632
00:35:45.991 --> 00:35:50.220
this is the first year that she couldn't come to our family cottage.
Um,

633
00:35:51.210 --> 00:35:54.810
and she's,
she's not because she doesn't want to.
It's,
it's,

634
00:35:54.840 --> 00:35:57.000
it's because of the Kleiner health.
She wasn't able to go,

635
00:35:57.090 --> 00:36:00.870
she wasn't able to make the trip and there's been no decline in her desire to

636
00:36:00.871 --> 00:36:01.860
spend time with their loved ones.

637
00:36:01.861 --> 00:36:05.820
There was no decline in her desire to enjoy the life that you had.

638
00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:11.190
And so I'm personally moved by this problem.
We all are.
I think,
I think we,
we've,

639
00:36:11.460 --> 00:36:14.760
especially as we've as a culture of experience,
age related disease more,

640
00:36:15.660 --> 00:36:18.750
I think what we've done is we've told ourselves stories to,
to,

641
00:36:18.751 --> 00:36:21.810
to come to deal with it.
We kind of have to,
it's a,
you know,

642
00:36:21.811 --> 00:36:26.460
these are therapies to deal with this,
this thing is facing us.
Um,
and we can,

643
00:36:26.461 --> 00:36:30.900
sometimes we conflate,
I think the wisdom of age,
uh,
with,
with the,
what,

644
00:36:30.920 --> 00:36:32.710
what age looks like and,
and,

645
00:36:32.711 --> 00:36:37.530
and the experience of like the pigs and pains of age.
And I,
I,
you know,

646
00:36:37.980 --> 00:36:41.400
if age,
we call it the golden years,
but if aging was a product,

647
00:36:41.401 --> 00:36:44.970
nobody would buy it.
Like if you are,

648
00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:47.160
if you're given the option in any given year,
and someone said,
hey,

649
00:36:47.220 --> 00:36:50.010
how about you can either agency or a little more or you don't have to,

650
00:36:50.040 --> 00:36:53.050
you'd be like,
I don't have to,
I won't,
I won't,
I won't use this here.
Um,

651
00:36:53.310 --> 00:36:57.870
if you take it year to year.
And,
um,
interestingly,

652
00:36:57.871 --> 00:36:59.540
so we're out here.
I mean we're,
we're,

653
00:36:59.541 --> 00:37:01.980
we're very various in Michigan and we have operations like in North Carolina and

654
00:37:01.981 --> 00:37:05.580
stuff and we're out in the valley where we talk about what we're doing and this

655
00:37:05.581 --> 00:37:08.970
problem that we see and we get a lot of like,
cool,
awesome.
Yeah,
knock it out.

656
00:37:08.971 --> 00:37:12.510
Like,
um,
and put in Michigan and some of the places in their lives,

657
00:37:12.540 --> 00:37:15.550
we often get like,
people like,
you know,
different looks,
people said,
well,
hey,

658
00:37:15.680 --> 00:37:18.120
you're there checking.
And so there has to be,

659
00:37:18.121 --> 00:37:21.510
there's going to be a shift that has to occur culturally too as this happened.

660
00:37:22.300 --> 00:37:26.610
Um,
but I don't want to,
I don't want to be unrealistic.
It's a hard,

661
00:37:26.611 --> 00:37:31.350
it's a difficult problem.
And as a physicist,
you know,
turn biologists,

662
00:37:31.740 --> 00:37:33.720
I see it as like through thermodynamics.

663
00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:38.790
You can't take a system and really turn that system and its and its surroundings

664
00:37:38.791 --> 00:37:40.890
to its initial state.
You got entropy to deal with.

665
00:37:41.370 --> 00:37:45.780
And so there's disorder whenever you're trying to create order DNA repaired kind

666
00:37:45.781 --> 00:37:50.640
of easy clean repair or not so easy.
Um,
and,
and what you have to deal with,

667
00:37:50.910 --> 00:37:55.470
if you're,
if you're trying to revert a system so complex to an earlier state,

668
00:37:55.980 --> 00:38:00.870
you have to deal with,
um,
what,
what you've created in that process.

669
00:38:01.050 --> 00:38:03.910
You have to,
all of the complicated click has complexities and,

670
00:38:03.911 --> 00:38:06.150
and then really like almost the exhaust of the,

671
00:38:06.550 --> 00:38:11.550
the process and that that is going to create Bob skulls on his path.

672
00:38:14.370 --> 00:38:17.430
And you know,
um,
for instance,

673
00:38:17.490 --> 00:38:21.210
so CRISPR is a technology that many people are aware with this new gene editing

674
00:38:21.211 --> 00:38:25.200
technology.
Well,
we just are starting to uncover that CRISPR,

675
00:38:25.201 --> 00:38:26.760
when you use it in an organism,

676
00:38:26.761 --> 00:38:30.560
there might be some other interactions and leading to some,
um,

677
00:38:30.580 --> 00:38:33.330
it might be not just editing the gene you wanted to edit.

678
00:38:33.331 --> 00:38:35.410
You might be editing a bunch of other genes.
Uh,

679
00:38:35.500 --> 00:38:37.360
mother nature is extremely efficient.

680
00:38:37.840 --> 00:38:41.810
She doesn't use the same,
the one thing for only one,

681
00:38:41.811 --> 00:38:46.330
a one purpose in biology is generally a lot of different,
uh,
s loops,

682
00:38:46.470 --> 00:38:49.690
um,
and insured mechanisms and,
uh,
and that,

683
00:38:49.691 --> 00:38:53.980
that makes this a difficult problem to address.
I,

684
00:38:53.981 --> 00:38:57.370
we're good at what we're gonna do first is we're going to slow the aging process

685
00:38:57.371 --> 00:38:59.250
before we're going to start to turn it backwards.
Um,

686
00:38:59.410 --> 00:39:03.520
for that reason I strongly believe,
but at least to to great extent.

687
00:39:04.510 --> 00:39:07.860
Um,
but so we've delivered,
we've,
we've developed this,
what was,
you know,

688
00:39:07.861 --> 00:39:11.170
it was like kind of a hack,
right?
Not enough technology.
Um,
we're,

689
00:39:11.171 --> 00:39:15.940
we're freezing youth.
Um,
so we can have a leg up.
I,
you know,
worst case scenario,

690
00:39:15.941 --> 00:39:18.790
you've got a young cells to treat age related disease,
but,

691
00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:21.340
but what we really want to do is his first attack,

692
00:39:21.341 --> 00:39:25.300
the decline in the stem cell niche.
And then from there,
you know,

693
00:39:25.301 --> 00:39:26.770
having this youthful biology of this,

694
00:39:27.550 --> 00:39:29.830
we can apply some of these new technologies.

695
00:39:29.860 --> 00:39:34.860
So I have my 40 year old cells banked and I'm 42.

696
00:39:35.830 --> 00:39:39.220
And,
um,
it would be very difficult for me to get 40 year old cells,

697
00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:43.810
my own 40 year old cells now unless they were not in Franklin,
Massachusetts.

698
00:39:44.320 --> 00:39:48.920
Um,
and,
and,
and,
and so by doing that,
we kind of create this,
uh,

699
00:39:49.480 --> 00:39:51.970
asset that we can work upon and we can,
we can draw upon.

700
00:39:51.970 --> 00:39:54.880
And so I think we'll be able to accelerate the end,
the,

701
00:39:55.360 --> 00:39:58.540
the application of some of these technologies that are in the pipeline by doing

702
00:39:58.541 --> 00:40:03.490
what we're doing.
That's part of it also,
to be honest,
I think that by,

703
00:40:04.870 --> 00:40:09.400
by finding people that are interested in,
in,
in taking action now,
um,

704
00:40:09.401 --> 00:40:11.320
about their future health,
it kind of reminded that way.

705
00:40:11.321 --> 00:40:16.270
They're there for leaning.
That we also create a kind of a cultural,

706
00:40:16.630 --> 00:40:17.860
you know,
a chef.

707
00:40:17.861 --> 00:40:20.920
We get a community of people that are just thinking about themselves in their

708
00:40:20.921 --> 00:40:21.940
health a little bit differently.

709
00:40:21.941 --> 00:40:24.910
And I think that's going to be important because we have a big transition

710
00:40:24.940 --> 00:40:29.230
culturally,
if for that's going to come with this technological transition.

711
00:40:32.130 --> 00:40:37.090
So what's going to happen is we're going to move to health maintenance and we a

712
00:40:37.091 --> 00:40:39.360
fermilabs.
That's our job.
That's our goal,
is to like precipitate this,

713
00:40:39.380 --> 00:40:42.750
make this happen faster,
do what we can.
Um,

714
00:40:43.590 --> 00:40:47.370
and what's going to come with it is a change in the way we think about ourselves

715
00:40:47.520 --> 00:40:48.990
and the way we think about aging.

716
00:40:49.770 --> 00:40:52.140
I think in a couple of generations you're gonna have kids and they're,

717
00:40:52.141 --> 00:40:53.490
you look at this picture and they'll say,

718
00:40:53.491 --> 00:40:55.920
why does everybody decided have white hair?

719
00:40:56.220 --> 00:41:00.630
And why are they and why are they sitting in chairs with wheels?
Um,
and,

720
00:41:00.720 --> 00:41:03.390
and you know,
it's,
it's,
it's,

721
00:41:03.391 --> 00:41:07.320
it's truly going to change who we are.
Um,
and I think,

722
00:41:07.321 --> 00:41:11.220
I think for the better because this is not great.
Um,

723
00:41:11.730 --> 00:41:13.770
so thank you very much for coming.
I appreciate it.

724
00:41:16.810 --> 00:41:19.560
<v 1>Do
you have a question?</v>

725
00:41:24.130 --> 00:41:27.360
<v 0>Thanks so much,
mark.
We had a few questions submitted ahead of time on the dory,</v>

726
00:41:27.370 --> 00:41:29.830
but if there are live questions,
we also have microphones here.

727
00:41:34.700 --> 00:41:36.970
Go ahead and ask them.
I have a knife right here.
Okay.
Okay.

728
00:41:39.590 --> 00:41:40.423
All right.
Go.

729
00:41:40.520 --> 00:41:44.930
<v 3>18 years ago I wrote a screenplay based on multiple sources,</v>

730
00:41:44.931 --> 00:41:49.120
saying that people like Henry Kissinger,
uh,

731
00:41:49.150 --> 00:41:50.730
we're um,
uh,

732
00:41:50.750 --> 00:41:54.980
purchasing fetal tissue from multiple sources where it's available.

733
00:41:55.010 --> 00:41:59.620
As we've seen with planned parenthood,
there's multiple places and um,

734
00:41:59.690 --> 00:42:01.550
intravenously ingesting it.

735
00:42:01.551 --> 00:42:05.030
So basically you have a cannibalism of the young.

736
00:42:05.450 --> 00:42:08.560
What keeps this going in that direction?
Well,

737
00:42:08.561 --> 00:42:10.030
hopefully it is the difference in immunity.

738
00:42:10.180 --> 00:42:14.240
I'll slow it down and distill this down to you.

739
00:42:14.241 --> 00:42:16.610
Notice how he never ages.
He's just kissing her.

740
00:42:17.680 --> 00:42:22.250
So I don't know what his,
his,
his story is,
but he's amazing.
Yeah,
he's,

741
00:42:22.251 --> 00:42:23.870
they always looks the same for you.

742
00:42:23.871 --> 00:42:26.570
Go back to those old pictures and compare to the new pictures.
It's like,
wow,

743
00:42:26.700 --> 00:42:27.533
that's guy.

744
00:42:28.620 --> 00:42:33.600
<v 0>Was that guy that comp did Saint Germain?
Maybe he's at two.
He is.
Um,
so yeah,
I,
I,</v>

745
00:42:33.900 --> 00:42:35.970
I,
I think if we

746
00:42:38.100 --> 00:42:42.870
step one step one is,
is,
is I,
I believe is this,

747
00:42:42.871 --> 00:42:47.850
that,
that we can draw on her own biology and,
and there are ways,
you know,

748
00:42:48.150 --> 00:42:52.950
you might've heard of,
you know,
the,
the young blood effect.
Um,
there's a couple,

749
00:42:53.100 --> 00:42:53.551
there's actually,

750
00:42:53.551 --> 00:42:56.880
there's a trial called the Ambrosia trial where they're taking young plasma from

751
00:42:56.881 --> 00:42:57.331
patients,

752
00:42:57.331 --> 00:43:02.331
donors and people are treating themselves to see if they can have an effect upon

753
00:43:02.400 --> 00:43:07.170
their,
their aging biomarkers,
say their biology and rejuvenate it.
And,
um,

754
00:43:07.230 --> 00:43:08.850
interestingly,
so the bone marrow,

755
00:43:08.880 --> 00:43:10.680
especially the Mesenchymal stem cell they was talking about,

756
00:43:11.010 --> 00:43:15.420
it releases a lot of soluble factors into the blood that affect the,

757
00:43:15.500 --> 00:43:17.190
the state of the body.

758
00:43:17.580 --> 00:43:21.690
And we're actually pretty confident that part of the younger blood effect that

759
00:43:21.691 --> 00:43:22.740
you see.
Then this happens.

760
00:43:22.780 --> 00:43:24.990
Like what they'll do is they'll take an old mouse and I like the young mouse.

761
00:43:24.991 --> 00:43:28.920
It's really grizzly.
They'll,
they'll put their vascular there,

762
00:43:28.980 --> 00:43:31.330
their circulatory systems together and um,

763
00:43:31.350 --> 00:43:34.140
but they'll see rejuvenation and the old mouse,
um,
from this,

764
00:43:34.260 --> 00:43:36.810
this young blood donation.
And,
uh,

765
00:43:38.340 --> 00:43:41.820
the bone marrow gives birth the most of what's in the blood.
Um,

766
00:43:41.910 --> 00:43:44.700
and we do think that if you can re re juvenate the bone marrow,

767
00:43:44.701 --> 00:43:48.570
you're going to get kind of an autologous Youngblood effect.
Um,
so yeah,

768
00:43:48.600 --> 00:43:52.290
I guess that's a,
that is a tough question.
What's gonna stop us from,
well,

769
00:43:52.710 --> 00:43:55.170
I think I hopefully a lot of things to stop us from doing other things like
that.

770
00:43:57.480 --> 00:44:02.310
The young glide,
oh,
oh gosh.
I don't know.

771
00:44:02.311 --> 00:44:06.000
I have spoken to some people that I think there's some people that have done

772
00:44:06.001 --> 00:44:08.700
some kind of crazy stuff I don't know about against being Henry Kissinger.

773
00:44:11.070 --> 00:44:12.150
Yeah.
So I mean,

774
00:44:13.800 --> 00:44:17.310
I'll say this young cells I've done in the lab,

775
00:44:17.520 --> 00:44:21.060
I've taken the soluble factors from young cells and treated old cells with them

776
00:44:21.510 --> 00:44:23.880
and you do see some kind of rejuvenate effect.
There's,

777
00:44:24.160 --> 00:44:27.480
there's a way that that young biology can,

778
00:44:27.630 --> 00:44:31.580
can kind of encourage all biology to,
to act a little more young,
but can't.
Yeah.

779
00:44:31.620 --> 00:44:33.650
Specifically.
So I've got it.
Okay.

780
00:44:34.750 --> 00:44:36.400
<v 3>Uh,
yeah,
I was just wondering if,</v>

781
00:44:36.410 --> 00:44:40.580
if you could comment on how you think basic human habits,

782
00:44:40.581 --> 00:44:44.090
like what we eat,
exercise,

783
00:44:44.360 --> 00:44:49.020
sex even I've heard,
I've heard it's like having orgasms,
uh,

784
00:44:49.370 --> 00:44:53.470
having many orgasms like makes you live shorter.
I've heard that.
Ah,
I duNno.

785
00:44:53.510 --> 00:44:54.343
I've seen,

786
00:44:54.470 --> 00:44:59.120
could you just comment on this and just give advice and what you should and

787
00:44:59.121 --> 00:45:03.710
should not do live longer.
Did you also grow up Catholic?

788
00:45:06.670 --> 00:45:10.140
<v 0>I kid,
I kid.
Um,
no.
So,
um,</v>

789
00:45:10.870 --> 00:45:12.490
I think there are some,

790
00:45:13.060 --> 00:45:16.450
there's evidence for Keller restriction and a lot of animals even up to a rhesus

791
00:45:16.451 --> 00:45:18.460
monkeys,
there's pretty good evidence.
Um,

792
00:45:18.790 --> 00:45:23.560
it's difficult in humans to see longevity.
That takes a long time.
Um,

793
00:45:23.730 --> 00:45:26.710
there was some evidence though that low calorie restriction,

794
00:45:26.740 --> 00:45:30.730
so just not over eating and keeping you too,
you know,

795
00:45:31.540 --> 00:45:35.620
I'm not a nutritionist,
but a lot of those,
a moving target,

796
00:45:35.650 --> 00:45:40.070
nutritional guidance and um,
there is evidence from,
you know,

797
00:45:40.090 --> 00:45:43.090
flatworms all the way up to the rhesus monkey that if you keep your calorie

798
00:45:43.091 --> 00:45:46.720
restriction at about two thirds of what normally people they would normally eat

799
00:45:46.721 --> 00:45:51.430
if they're just able to get food.
Um,
and that seems to have some benefit.
Um,

800
00:45:52.330 --> 00:45:53.440
and that was actually something that I,

801
00:45:53.441 --> 00:45:57.760
I keep my calories down on diet and exercise.
That's,
yeah.
Um,

802
00:45:57.910 --> 00:46:01.120
and there's actually been a lot of studies using mice and exercising them and

803
00:46:01.121 --> 00:46:02.890
looking at,
at,
at,
at that effect upon their,

804
00:46:03.220 --> 00:46:05.170
their health span is generally when you affect better,

805
00:46:05.410 --> 00:46:08.980
not overall lifespan is much,
but health span,
it seems that once you get to the,

806
00:46:09.250 --> 00:46:12.400
to the,
um,
you know,

807
00:46:12.430 --> 00:46:16.330
a hundred and so your point genetics really starts to take over into determine

808
00:46:16.331 --> 00:46:20.490
who's going to be around,
who's not.
Um,
I,
I,
yeah,

809
00:46:20.630 --> 00:46:23.890
I think it's interesting.
I think it's a very interesting question.

810
00:46:24.250 --> 00:46:27.790
I didn't mention this,
but,
so this is something we use mice,
right?

811
00:46:27.791 --> 00:46:30.520
And rats and we,
because their biology so similar,

812
00:46:31.300 --> 00:46:34.150
but a mouse or rat lives two years if their biology so similar,

813
00:46:34.151 --> 00:46:38.140
why do they live two years?
Um,
and that begs the question is,

814
00:46:38.410 --> 00:46:43.300
is this decline,
uh,
partially programmatic.
Um,
and can we play with that?

815
00:46:43.600 --> 00:46:45.330
I have a five year old daughter,
uh,

816
00:46:45.340 --> 00:46:49.730
she seems to be growing up rather than old right now.
Um,

817
00:46:49.870 --> 00:46:53.650
and she's got a biology very similar to mine.
What is that?
When is,
you know,
and,

818
00:46:53.651 --> 00:46:55.420
and,
and is there some kind of,

819
00:46:55.780 --> 00:46:59.410
are these mechanisms that we can play with at that switching point?
So,
yeah,

820
00:46:59.411 --> 00:47:01.820
I guess I went hope younger freshman.
So,
um,

821
00:47:02.390 --> 00:47:04.310
<v 3>my question is fundamentally what is aging?</v>

822
00:47:04.311 --> 00:47:07.100
Is there some sort of counter in the cell that just accumulates in number of

823
00:47:07.101 --> 00:47:10.580
cell divisions?
Or is there like a,
a number of cell divisions?

824
00:47:10.581 --> 00:47:14.400
Each cell has which case he gets tied into,
cleaned up by the immune system.
Like,

825
00:47:14.690 --> 00:47:18.990
<v 0>yeah,
I think that question is not answered.
It settled.
But,
um,</v>

826
00:47:19.040 --> 00:47:23.840
there are things that,
you know,
divisions in the cell,
every division,
you know,

827
00:47:24.080 --> 00:47:28.880
we'll risk some kind of error so that you can begin to build up an error.
Um,

828
00:47:29.170 --> 00:47:31.210
we have certain things that our cells do,

829
00:47:31.420 --> 00:47:36.420
they generate garbage and then they will throw the garbage out and incinerated,

830
00:47:37.090 --> 00:47:40.720
but sometimes some garbage is sticky and it builds up.
Um,

831
00:47:40.780 --> 00:47:45.190
so sometimes it,
and it correlates all the time,
but you know,

832
00:47:45.191 --> 00:47:48.790
our journey or journeys around the sun,
but like it's,
it's,

833
00:47:49.600 --> 00:47:51.930
it's not driven by that.
Um,

834
00:47:51.970 --> 00:47:56.830
it just relates to it and there's ways you can play with the biology and you

835
00:47:56.831 --> 00:48:00.580
can,
um,
get it to relate less to time.
Um,

836
00:48:01.390 --> 00:48:05.410
so yeah,
there's an interesting,
so there's a thing called the Hayflick limit,

837
00:48:05.740 --> 00:48:09.030
which is,
you know,
um,
in cell culture,
it,

838
00:48:09.160 --> 00:48:13.100
it was kind of a thought that you,

839
00:48:13.200 --> 00:48:15.670
after about 60 division cells will just cease to define culture.

840
00:48:15.670 --> 00:48:19.870
But that's not always the case.
So our hemopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow,

841
00:48:19.871 --> 00:48:22.720
they actually divide way more than how you flick limit throughout her lifetime.

842
00:48:23.030 --> 00:48:23.790
Um,
and,

843
00:48:23.790 --> 00:48:26.980
and Mesenchymal stem cells are pretty sensitive to this culture conditions.

844
00:48:26.981 --> 00:48:29.110
We're already finding culture conditions,
which you can,

845
00:48:29.350 --> 00:48:32.170
you can divide them in and they can go further upon date.

846
00:48:32.260 --> 00:48:33.550
So it's really a matter of like

847
00:48:35.650 --> 00:48:40.470
not the time but how much the cell is,
is working to keep itself.
You've,

848
00:48:40.560 --> 00:48:42.210
you know,
retain it and keep yourself.

849
00:48:42.220 --> 00:48:45.130
You were full and there is a really interesting question of why,
how,

850
00:48:45.131 --> 00:48:48.910
what is that?
Are these trigger points?
Can we,
can we tweak them?
Yeah.

851
00:48:49.750 --> 00:48:51.520
<v 4>All right.
Question from the Dory.
Sure.</v>

852
00:48:52.330 --> 00:48:55.780
What core scientific breakthroughs need to meet needs to be made for your

853
00:48:55.781 --> 00:48:58.530
technology to actually work?
What are the downside?

854
00:48:59.450 --> 00:49:01.910
<v 0>Well,
ideally</v>

855
00:49:03.410 --> 00:49:04.760
we can do what happened in the mice.

856
00:49:05.330 --> 00:49:10.330
Ideally we can take our young bone marrow stem cells and we can just give them

857
00:49:11.391 --> 00:49:14.060
ivy like they did to ourselves.
And actually a lot of the,
when you do this,

858
00:49:14.061 --> 00:49:18.080
a lot of the [inaudible] holding back to the button incorporate and ideally that

859
00:49:18.081 --> 00:49:21.710
will provide or juvenile of effect and that will,
I will consider that working.

860
00:49:21.711 --> 00:49:24.260
If we get increased health span,
I'll consider that working.

861
00:49:24.261 --> 00:49:27.230
If we can get an increase in lifespan like that.
I like myself,

862
00:49:27.231 --> 00:49:32.090
you've got this incredible,
but there are things that,
that,
um,
we could do.

863
00:49:32.091 --> 00:49:34.670
So I mentioned those senescent cells,

864
00:49:35.030 --> 00:49:39.740
the cells that that turn off and they kind of,
you know,
uh,

865
00:49:39.920 --> 00:49:44.670
negatively impact the tissue around them.
Well,
there's,
there's,
uh,
some,
um,

866
00:49:45.230 --> 00:49:50.230
work and there's actually a couple of companies here in this area that are

867
00:49:50.241 --> 00:49:51.620
working on clearing out those cells.

868
00:49:52.100 --> 00:49:56.900
And there's reason to believe that if we could maybe a couple of clearing that

869
00:49:56.901 --> 00:49:59.960
with the rejuvenation at the same time,
we might amp it up.
So it's,

870
00:49:59.961 --> 00:50:02.420
a lot of this is gonna be stepwise.
I think that there's,

871
00:50:02.480 --> 00:50:04.310
there's no great wall that we need to,

872
00:50:04.460 --> 00:50:06.590
we need to get over it because I think it's many,
many,

873
00:50:06.591 --> 00:50:10.160
many different hurdles and we're going to knock him down.
And,
um,
you know,

874
00:50:10.190 --> 00:50:13.640
I often people will talk about the escape velocity.
So if you can,

875
00:50:14.120 --> 00:50:17.790
if you can teach yourself fast when you age,
you know,
then you made it.
Um,

876
00:50:18.200 --> 00:50:23.090
and so I don't think there's one,
one big thing blocking us,
but countless.

877
00:50:24.500 --> 00:50:24.660
<v 4>Hi.</v>

878
00:50:24.660 --> 00:50:29.660
So there's kind of a classic bioethics of how you account for racial and

879
00:50:29.871 --> 00:50:33.170
economic disparity when you're developing technologies like this and how do you

880
00:50:33.171 --> 00:50:37.940
continue to work without leaving poor people behind?
Should rich people,
sorry,

881
00:50:37.941 --> 00:50:38.671
should living longer.

882
00:50:38.671 --> 00:50:41.750
It'd be something that only the rich can afford to do and have.

883
00:50:42.050 --> 00:50:44.180
And how do you balance that as you develop your own company?

884
00:50:44.270 --> 00:50:48.200
<v 0>Definitely.
Um,
yeah.
So,
uh,</v>

885
00:50:49.220 --> 00:50:53.510
I came,
I,
I,
you know,
I came from a middle class family and like we had,
you know,

886
00:50:54.370 --> 00:50:59.210
middle class health care,
I think.
So it depends.
A lot of these tech,

887
00:50:59.360 --> 00:51:01.850
a lot of technologies are available so people can pay for him first,
right?

888
00:51:01.851 --> 00:51:06.350
Even cell phones or whatnot.
Um,
and that's going to be the case here.
Uh,

889
00:51:08.120 --> 00:51:09.260
the,
the,
the,
the,

890
00:51:09.261 --> 00:51:13.310
the funding is not set up like I spared the healthcare system's not set up to

891
00:51:13.311 --> 00:51:16.760
deliver these technologies aggressively to the greater population.

892
00:51:16.761 --> 00:51:18.740
They need to be proven and in order to be proven,

893
00:51:18.950 --> 00:51:21.770
and you people were willing to take a risk and it's going to be a private
sector,

894
00:51:22.190 --> 00:51:26.960
um,
but they better funnel down.
They have to funnel down.
I mean,
that's the point.

895
00:51:27.260 --> 00:51:31.700
Um,
I,
I think that,
you know,

896
00:51:32.710 --> 00:51:35.450
and,
and I just,
this year,
I,
I'm just philosophical thing.

897
00:51:35.450 --> 00:51:37.490
I think everything should funnel it on.
Otherwise you've disrupted,

898
00:51:37.491 --> 00:51:38.750
you're gonna have,
you're gonna you're,
you're,

899
00:51:38.751 --> 00:51:42.150
you're going to create a situation that's some title,
um,
everybody,
you know,

900
00:51:42.210 --> 00:51:47.180
should have access.
[inaudible] and,
um,
but,
but the,
it's going to be the people,

901
00:51:47.181 --> 00:51:50.970
the,
the people that are willing to take the risk on this art can be private,

902
00:51:50.971 --> 00:51:55.490
you know,
our private.
Um,
but,
but yeah,
I think it's interesting though,

903
00:51:55.760 --> 00:51:58.340
so once you increase the lifespan of people,

904
00:51:58.341 --> 00:52:03.170
you drastically decreased the number of children they have.
And,
and,

905
00:52:03.280 --> 00:52:06.800
and as,
as in developing countries,
it changes the economics pretty drastically,

906
00:52:06.801 --> 00:52:11.070
that once the economic situation is such that,
um,

907
00:52:12.110 --> 00:52:16.430
that,
that they,
that they're doing better than that,

908
00:52:16.520 --> 00:52:17.570
then you tend to have less children.

909
00:52:17.571 --> 00:52:20.420
And I think it'll be interesting to see if that's what happens.
If we,

910
00:52:21.920 --> 00:52:24.620
I think one thing that's interesting about this is if we're living longer,

911
00:52:24.621 --> 00:52:29.000
we're going to think longer term and something maybe like global

912
00:52:31.670 --> 00:52:34.930
warming is an issue that,
you know,
if you're going to be there,

913
00:52:35.490 --> 00:52:37.520
going to think about it,
um,
you're going to,

914
00:52:37.521 --> 00:52:39.590
you're thinking about the different way.
I'm fine.
Yeah,

915
00:52:39.591 --> 00:52:41.640
I think it remains to be seen,
but I do think it's,

916
00:52:41.930 --> 00:52:46.010
<v 1>pardon?
Right.
Another question from the door?</v>

917
00:52:47.870 --> 00:52:52.580
Nope.
Have one question back here.

918
00:52:54.420 --> 00:52:56.650
<v 4>Okay.
Actually I have two quick questions.</v>

919
00:52:56.950 --> 00:53:01.950
So the first is for those of us considering to a bank stem cells with you guys,

920
00:53:02.860 --> 00:53:07.600
um,
you know,
a lot of us would want to keep them around for 30,
40,
50 years.

921
00:53:07.930 --> 00:53:11.270
And since you guys are a startup,
how do we,
how do we know that still there,

922
00:53:11.290 --> 00:53:12.050
right question.

923
00:53:12.050 --> 00:53:15.410
<v 0>Yeah.
Um,
yeah,
so we are,</v>

924
00:53:15.680 --> 00:53:20.030
we've actually had been searching for an insurance company that will basically

925
00:53:20.031 --> 00:53:22.160
take us like,
so if we go out of business while we get a premium,

926
00:53:22.161 --> 00:53:25.320
they don't cover the costs with rest of life,
but we actually charge like a,

927
00:53:25.321 --> 00:53:26.190
so what we do is we've,

928
00:53:26.520 --> 00:53:30.600
the way we're working on right now as there as an annual storage fee and,

929
00:53:30.840 --> 00:53:35.410
and we've hit parity now that what the,

930
00:53:35.560 --> 00:53:39.450
our clients are paying the fee covers the cost.
And so,
um,

931
00:53:39.510 --> 00:53:42.090
we're looking to create a mechanism where we'll spin it off.

932
00:53:42.091 --> 00:53:44.880
So if for some reason we crashed and burned as,
you know,
as a startup,

933
00:53:45.090 --> 00:53:46.080
we would still have this,

934
00:53:46.290 --> 00:53:49.410
this entity that everybody paid into and they have their cells going in there.

935
00:53:49.770 --> 00:53:52.690
Uh,
that still,
I mean,
still the storage,
they're stored there.
Um,

936
00:53:52.740 --> 00:53:53.431
my cells are in there,

937
00:53:53.431 --> 00:53:56.130
my wife sells her in there and it's important to us that we're going to keep

938
00:53:56.131 --> 00:54:00.660
doing this to keep them there.
Um,
but it's a good question.
I'm trying to,

939
00:54:00.661 --> 00:54:03.990
if anybody knows,
a,
an insurance company wants to write us a new kind of premium,

940
00:54:04.050 --> 00:54:06.990
let me know a new kind of plan.
Um,
but,

941
00:54:08.310 --> 00:54:10.710
but yeah,
it's,
it's,
it's,
it's,
it's,
uh,

942
00:54:11.440 --> 00:54:14.030
it's something that we absolutely are trying to cover and that's,

943
00:54:14.090 --> 00:54:16.650
that's how we're doing it approaching right now.
Um,

944
00:54:18.570 --> 00:54:20.840
we've had people ask if they're all,
they're all Massachusetts,
there's,

945
00:54:20.890 --> 00:54:24.630
or there's an FDA group,
like I'm compliant by repository,

946
00:54:24.840 --> 00:54:27.030
but a lot of people said,
well,
I want my cell phone actually both coasts.

947
00:54:27.300 --> 00:54:29.310
Like I just want them in Massachusetts.

948
00:54:30.150 --> 00:54:31.600
<v 4>Great.
So quick question was,
um,</v>

949
00:54:32.130 --> 00:54:33.660
I know you guys have all been doing this for about a year,

950
00:54:33.661 --> 00:54:38.661
but have you been able to successfully free someone's stem cells and then thaw

951
00:54:39.151 --> 00:54:40.920
them and then actually put them to use?

952
00:54:41.240 --> 00:54:46.040
<v 0>Well,
not put them to use?
Um,
yeah.
So to put them into use and the F in the US,</v>

953
00:54:46.041 --> 00:54:50.120
we have to be part of a FDA registered clinical trial.
Um,
but yeah,
we've,

954
00:54:50.210 --> 00:54:54.560
we've grown them in,
we freeze them,
we started them.
Um,
I,
I've,

955
00:54:54.650 --> 00:54:57.640
I've grown my own,
um,
to,
I,

956
00:54:57.800 --> 00:54:59.910
I have more outside me then inside of me just,
you know,

957
00:54:59.990 --> 00:55:03.990
as a matter of experiment.
But um,
but yeah,
we,
yeah,
yeah.

958
00:55:04.060 --> 00:55:05.200
It's actually the,

959
00:55:05.290 --> 00:55:08.030
the technology like that reviewer said it doesn't use enough technology.

960
00:55:08.031 --> 00:55:09.110
It's pretty simple.
It's tough.

961
00:55:13.280 --> 00:55:17.430
<v 4>A recent experiment extended the lifespan of older mice by 10 to 15%,</v>

962
00:55:17.460 --> 00:55:22.460
but implementing implanting neural stem cells into the hypothalamus can be MSC

963
00:55:23.390 --> 00:55:25.860
is be induced to differentiate into neural stem cells.

964
00:55:26.090 --> 00:55:30.470
<v 0>Great Question Dan.
So,
um,
yeah,
so</v>

965
00:55:32.300 --> 00:55:35.150
some people will tell you yes,
we tried it a lot.

966
00:55:35.180 --> 00:55:39.650
A lot of people tried it and they,
we we didn't um,
uh,

967
00:55:41.030 --> 00:55:44.480
you're trying to get to a,
a different germ layer of cells,

968
00:55:44.481 --> 00:55:48.320
but um,
we've seen them express neural proteins,

969
00:55:48.321 --> 00:55:51.290
we've seen them fuse with normal cells but not actually become functional neuro

970
00:55:51.291 --> 00:55:54.320
cells.
However,
that there was a study recently,

971
00:55:54.500 --> 00:55:57.380
just last week I think about the hypothalamus and this was really interesting.

972
00:55:57.381 --> 00:56:01.340
Yeah.
So they,
they found that my clearing the stem cells in the hypothalamus,

973
00:56:01.910 --> 00:56:06.710
they make the animals age more quickly by by re buy re,
re,

974
00:56:06.740 --> 00:56:11.030
uh,
juvenate and those cells,
they could actually expand the lifespan of the mice.

975
00:56:11.350 --> 00:56:15.590
And that's the hypothalamus is fascinating.
Um,
I,
one thing I am interested,

976
00:56:15.591 --> 00:56:19.790
so the,
the Mesenchymal stem cell has a power effect,

977
00:56:19.791 --> 00:56:23.000
powerful effect on these inflammatory cells in the brain called the Microglia.

978
00:56:23.710 --> 00:56:26.650
And it's one reason why we were interested in them and stroke and traumatic

979
00:56:26.651 --> 00:56:29.800
brain injury because you get microglia these inflammatory,

980
00:56:29.910 --> 00:56:33.310
these macrophage cells and they actually will start to call his death of neural

981
00:56:33.311 --> 00:56:35.760
stem cells.
And so,
um,

982
00:56:36.550 --> 00:56:39.660
we're interested in whether or not young MSC is.

983
00:56:39.820 --> 00:56:42.700
So one of the reasons that the hypothalamus degrades over time as you get this

984
00:56:42.701 --> 00:56:45.940
burden of micro glial cells in the hypothalamus.
So we're interested,

985
00:56:46.240 --> 00:56:48.310
can these cells be used to actually reduce that burden?

986
00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:51.700
<v 1>So yeah,
that's a good question.</v>

987
00:56:53.020 --> 00:56:55.810
<v 4>So,
um,
if you increase the lifespan of many,
many people,</v>

988
00:56:55.811 --> 00:56:57.660
if this becomes successful and widespread,

989
00:56:57.850 --> 00:57:02.080
then a problem for overpopulation is going to get a lot of us.

990
00:57:02.360 --> 00:57:04.540
Do you have any thoughts on how are we going to deal with this?

991
00:57:07.540 --> 00:57:09.710
<v 0>Yeah,
me personally,
no,</v>

992
00:57:10.880 --> 00:57:15.710
but I wonder,
I do wonder at that where we have fewer children,
um,
or not.

993
00:57:15.800 --> 00:57:20.300
And um,
but that's a lot.
There's a lot in that,
you know,

994
00:57:20.510 --> 00:57:25.280
I don't know.
I don't know.
I mean,
Mars.
Yeah.
I mean maybe we'll,
um,

995
00:57:25.970 --> 00:57:30.470
I mean the trip won't be such a big deal.
Right.
Um,
and,
and I don't know.

996
00:57:31.190 --> 00:57:34.190
I mean,
the thing is I think what we need to think about,

997
00:57:34.340 --> 00:57:37.900
cause this is gonna Happen,
um,
like,

998
00:57:38.240 --> 00:57:42.800
and I think we have to think about is not whether or not we should do it
because,

999
00:57:43.630 --> 00:57:44.180
uh,

1000
00:57:44.180 --> 00:57:47.030
I don't think we're going to reach consensus on whether or not we should do it.

1001
00:57:47.360 --> 00:57:49.490
I think what we can do is we can talk about,
well,
when it happens,

1002
00:57:49.491 --> 00:57:53.440
how do we deal with it?
And we've talked about that.
Um,
and,
and,

1003
00:57:53.460 --> 00:57:54.920
and so we have the best outcomes.
Yeah.

1004
00:57:58.610 --> 00:58:02.180
<v 4>Oh,
we have time for two more questions.
Okay.</v>

1005
00:58:02.190 --> 00:58:05.800
So thanks for answering my hackathon question.
As a follow up,

1006
00:58:06.550 --> 00:58:10.280
how feasible would it be to extract a neural stem cells?

1007
00:58:10.670 --> 00:58:14.080
<v 0>Ha.
Um,
yeah,
it's difficult.
Um,</v>

1008
00:58:15.420 --> 00:58:18.630
we are not credentialing urologists at the time.
Um,

1009
00:58:18.930 --> 00:58:23.630
and that procedure is a lot more invasive.
Um,
do you want to say,

1010
00:58:23.850 --> 00:58:25.260
so this guy has got this tee shirt here,

1011
00:58:25.261 --> 00:58:30.100
which there's only one way you can get this tee shirt.
I asked him.

1012
00:58:30.101 --> 00:58:34.750
It's okay.
Let me say it for the camera.
I asked him beforehand.

1013
00:58:34.770 --> 00:58:37.290
Otherwise that's a HIPAA violation.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1014
00:58:37.710 --> 00:58:39.020
There's only one way to get that tee shirt.
Um,

1015
00:58:39.270 --> 00:58:43.890
you want your neural stem cells out?
We,
we'll talk.
Yeah,
yeah,

1016
00:58:44.070 --> 00:58:48.550
yeah.
Um,
yeah,
that's,
that's it's,

1017
00:58:49.020 --> 00:58:49.710
so there are,

1018
00:58:49.710 --> 00:58:54.210
there's a thing called induced pluripotency and where you can take us,

1019
00:58:54.560 --> 00:58:57.270
I'm not as stem cell.
Even sometimes when you can,

1020
00:58:57.390 --> 00:59:00.840
you can express some jeans and you can get it to have a stem like state.
Um,

1021
00:59:00.860 --> 00:59:03.480
and then you can take that and make it a neural stem cell.
However,

1022
00:59:03.481 --> 00:59:04.830
right now we're not very good at it.

1023
00:59:05.070 --> 00:59:07.930
The way that we express the genes is not very subtle.
Um,

1024
00:59:08.070 --> 00:59:11.530
and those more often than not self Drusen,

1025
00:59:11.540 --> 00:59:13.860
that way we'll turn into what we call a teratoma kind of uncontrolled.

1026
00:59:13.920 --> 00:59:17.160
They don't behave unlike stem cells when they should be unlike some and,

1027
00:59:17.330 --> 00:59:22.190
but the the,
but that is one of the technologies we're getting better at.
So,
um,

1028
00:59:22.490 --> 00:59:26.860
when we do get to that point,
I'm having youthful cells that are on damage.
Um,

1029
00:59:26.890 --> 00:59:29.750
especially if they're multipotent you don't have to go as far to get them there.

1030
00:59:29.751 --> 00:59:32.930
So that's one way that might be addressed rather than going into your brain.

1031
00:59:35.830 --> 00:59:38.890
<v 3>Right.
So a height,
so I have the two questions,
a short one,
long,</v>

1032
00:59:38.891 --> 00:59:42.900
one short one first.
Um,
when you extract stem cells,
uh,

1033
00:59:43.030 --> 00:59:46.180
women that have an effect on the organism,
much like you keep them in,

1034
00:59:46.181 --> 00:59:50.440
then it helps you afterwards when we actually hoped you dry them.
So yeah,
we take

1035
00:59:50.550 --> 00:59:52.860
<v 0>very little.
So for a bone marrow transplant,</v>

1036
00:59:52.861 --> 00:59:55.790
if you do it by the methods that which we are going aspiration,
they're talking,

1037
00:59:55.840 --> 01:00:00.630
they'll take,
it's about 800 milliliter cc's of bone marrow.
We take about 60 CCS.

1038
01:00:00.660 --> 01:00:02.220
So that's,
you know,
just take 10%.

1039
01:00:02.221 --> 01:00:05.190
It's about 2% of your overall bone marrow blood making bone marrow.

1040
01:00:05.310 --> 01:00:08.850
So very few of your cells actually have to divide replacements,
most laws.
Um,

1041
01:00:09.030 --> 01:00:11.850
and it's kind of like donating blood.
It's often considered advanced blood drawn.

1042
01:00:11.910 --> 01:00:12.743
It's not okay.

1043
01:00:12.960 --> 01:00:16.090
<v 1>Um,
yeah.
Um,
and so no.</v>

1044
01:00:16.660 --> 01:00:19.840
<v 3>Okay.
And the long one is a short,
you've heard of Aubrey de grey,</v>

1045
01:00:19.960 --> 01:00:24.040
the guy with the longevity escape velocity and all that and his latest idea to

1046
01:00:24.041 --> 01:00:26.560
cure cancer is to,
uh,

1047
01:00:26.700 --> 01:00:29.950
re removed telomerase from the genome essentially.

1048
01:00:29.951 --> 01:00:34.930
Like you cannot make long race and make stem cells that have it.
Yeah.
I love,

1049
01:00:35.020 --> 01:00:39.990
and then just get a shot of those through every so often.
Right,
right.
I mean,

1050
01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:40.720
think of the idea.

1051
01:00:40.720 --> 01:00:43.120
I think it's one of the things through delivery is going to be tough.

1052
01:00:43.150 --> 01:00:44.860
I really think the,

1053
01:00:45.260 --> 01:00:48.110
<v 0>you know,
thinking about things in that way,
it's really cool.</v>

1054
01:00:48.111 --> 01:00:50.750
You use this completely counterintuitive approach.
Um,

1055
01:00:51.590 --> 01:00:54.580
but I do think it's complicated by getting the cells to the right place and,

1056
01:00:54.860 --> 01:00:59.670
and then,
gosh,
that's,
you're going to come back,
come back,
come back.
Also,
um,

1057
01:01:00.470 --> 01:01:05.060
the,
the telomeres themselves and their rate of change of the telomeres,

1058
01:01:05.240 --> 01:01:09.380
it actually is,
is a signal for other expression of other genes in the cells.

1059
01:01:09.590 --> 01:01:14.060
And so I think that if you did that,
if you were just turning until the race off,

1060
01:01:14.270 --> 01:01:16.730
that you might have these effects,

1061
01:01:16.760 --> 01:01:20.870
you might induce effects at that based on regulatory mechanisms that are looking

1062
01:01:20.871 --> 01:01:24.830
at them and look into the rate of change.
Um,
that's,
that's one of those things.

1063
01:01:24.831 --> 01:01:28.310
It's,
it's,
you know,
whenever you're,
uh,

1064
01:01:28.670 --> 01:01:31.910
dealing with biology as they,
you want to do one thing,

1065
01:01:31.911 --> 01:01:35.660
you want to effect one thing and then you find out it was a stool.
It was,

1066
01:01:35.661 --> 01:01:38.130
I'd like to know if it was another stool they didn't,
weren't aware of.
And,

1067
01:01:38.660 --> 01:01:41.840
and um,
yeah.
So I think that,
but I think it's a very,
you know,

1068
01:01:42.080 --> 01:01:45.110
it's a cool approach and I,
yeah,
but actually I had to talk him about it.

1069
01:01:45.340 --> 01:01:46.173
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1070
01:01:47.130 --> 01:01:48.390
<v 3>Well,
thanks so much.</v>

1071
01:01:48.900 --> 01:01:52.110
Thanks so much everyone for joining us and thanks mark for talking to Google.
