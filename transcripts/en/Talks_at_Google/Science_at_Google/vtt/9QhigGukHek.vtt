1
00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:12.700
For Ken.
[inaudible].

2
00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.710
<v 0>Thanks so much,
Ken.
All right,
I am so excited to,</v>

3
00:00:17.711 --> 00:00:20.640
to be here,
um,
with our guests today.

4
00:00:20.641 --> 00:00:23.610
So my name is Malique do card and uh,

5
00:00:23.611 --> 00:00:28.230
I head up the global family and learning team for a youtube and,

6
00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:33.180
and it's my great honor and pleasure to introduce,
uh,
the man,
the legend,

7
00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:34.670
uh,
Bill.
Nice.
So let's

8
00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.320
<v 2>round of applause
now</v>

9
00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:43.560
<v 0>around an hour.
And you know,</v>

10
00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:48.030
I could probably spend the whole hour introducing you,
but I'm,
I'll,

11
00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:52.750
I'll,
I'll spend the whole hour doing that.
Uh,
now how,
oh,

12
00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.460
a kickoff with a little bit of intro.

13
00:00:54.461 --> 00:00:59.110
So Bill Nye has been the public face of science for more than 20 years

14
00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:05.320
in his latest book that we'll talk a lot about today.
Everything all at once.

15
00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:07.360
How to unleash your inner nerd,

16
00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:12.540
tap into radical curiosity and solve any problem from Rodale books,

17
00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:15.340
night issues,

18
00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:20.080
a call to arms meant to encourage readers to really become the change they want

19
00:01:20.081 --> 00:01:23.710
to see in the world.
Whether addressing global warming,
social change,

20
00:01:23.711 --> 00:01:28.090
or personal success,
there are certain strategies that always gets results.

21
00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:30.760
Looking at the world with radical curiosity,

22
00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:35.170
being driven by a desire for a better future and being willing to take the

23
00:01:35.171 --> 00:01:38.230
actions needed to make change a reality.

24
00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:43.740
Best known as the host of Emmy Award winning PBS Discovery Channel Show Bill Nye

25
00:01:43.871 --> 00:01:44.704
the Science Scott

26
00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:48.700
<v 2>and the current home</v>

27
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.790
<v 0>Netflix show Bill Nye saves the world.</v>

28
00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:53.043
<v 2>Well that</v>

29
00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.040
<v 0>bill is a science educator,</v>

30
00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.450
mechanical engineer in New York Times bestselling author.

31
00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:05.460
He's also the CEO of the Planetary Society that we'll talk about and holds a bs

32
00:02:05.461 --> 00:02:10.190
in mechanical engineering from Cornell and has several doctorate degrees.
So,
uh,

33
00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:12.660
let's talk,
get a warm introduction or welcome to.

34
00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:16.160
<v 2>Thank you.
Thank you.</v>

35
00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:19.470
Is there any time where that's right.

36
00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:24.620
<v 0>All right.
So I had the opportunity to,
to read your book,</v>

37
00:02:24.621 --> 00:02:28.640
everything all at once and loved it and I appreciate that.
You know,

38
00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.510
a lot of times you get interviewed and they haven't read the book.
That's nice.

39
00:02:32.511 --> 00:02:36.110
Thank you.
Read it,
cover to cover.
And these are your people here.

40
00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:39.890
These are my people,
my,
my kids and why they are not in school today.

41
00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:45.110
What's your why?
I guess so.
Can you tell us what,

42
00:02:45.111 --> 00:02:46.760
what does everything all at once mean?

43
00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:52.370
So we have a great many problems facing humankind.
We have,

44
00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:57.500
when I was
in grade school,

45
00:02:57.501 --> 00:02:59.680
there were 3 billion people.
The world,

46
00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.990
<v 3>now they're almost 7.4 billion by 2050.
There certainly will be nine,</v>

47
00:03:04.991 --> 00:03:09.250
but there may be 10 billion people and they're all going to want access to

48
00:03:09.251 --> 00:03:13.300
Google.
They're all gonna want to live the way we live in the developed world.

49
00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:17.680
So this means we've got to provide clean water.
We're not reliable.

50
00:03:17.681 --> 00:03:21.490
Renewably produced electricity and access to the Internet to everybody.

51
00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:26.770
And that's a big job.
So we got to do everything all at once.

52
00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:31.810
And so along this line,
I,
um,

53
00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:35.740
I just tell her I'm not much for multitasking.

54
00:03:35.741 --> 00:03:38.680
I think the really much as I love all the young people,

55
00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:42.160
I think there really isn't any such thing.
Instead,

56
00:03:42.161 --> 00:03:46.990
you've got to keep in mind everything that has to be done as you accomplish each

57
00:03:46.991 --> 00:03:51.940
task.
Is that yeah,
that,
that,
that's catchy title.

58
00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:55.750
That's catchy.
I'm caught

59
00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:02.710
in reading this book.
It almost seemed like it was,

60
00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:05.640
um,
a manifesto.
Yes.
Uh,

61
00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:09.430
the nerd manifesto manifesto.
That's right.

62
00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:11.620
And do it this way.

63
00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:16.030
It's an activist's book that where's that come from?

64
00:04:16.031 --> 00:04:20.860
And what are you acting on?
Uh,
you want to leave?
There's two things.

65
00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:23.770
Everybody's responsible for his or her own actions.

66
00:04:23.771 --> 00:04:25.240
This is something my dad would say.

67
00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:29.020
And then you want to leave the world better than you found it if you can.

68
00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:34.630
And if we don't hustle,
we going to leave the world a lot worse than we found it.

69
00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:38.260
And so we got to get to work.
So that's why I'm activist.
I mean,

70
00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:42.700
I guess when it comes to things like scientific literacy,

71
00:04:42.701 --> 00:04:47.701
that seems like an obvious thing to be in favor of because it enables companies

72
00:04:48.101 --> 00:04:51.490
like that,
like this to change the world.
Uh,

73
00:04:51.491 --> 00:04:56.290
and it also enables a country like the United States to remain competitive

74
00:04:56.291 --> 00:05:00.460
economically because a innovation,
which is what you guys are all about.

75
00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:06.120
But then you would think that climate change would not be anything to argue

76
00:05:08.171 --> 00:05:10.980
about.
It would be something to get to work on.
Yet.
Uh,

77
00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:16.080
we have this amazing contingent or segment of our society that's in denial about

78
00:05:16.961 --> 00:05:21.961
climate change because of the success of the climate deniers.

79
00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:25.660
They had been so influential.
Three.
It's really amazing.
Yeah.

80
00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:30.110
So that's why I wrote this book.
Let's go.
That's right.

81
00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:32.600
When did we down at one o'clock you guys will be,

82
00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:36.950
you'll have it all set up by one 30.
We'll have all the order too.
It'll be done.

83
00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:41.390
And what,
why do you think that there are so many deniers?

84
00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:45.080
Because the fossil fuel industry,
yeah.
I mean,
that's not rocket surgery,
you guys,

85
00:05:45.081 --> 00:05:50.081
that fossil fuel industry is just really throwing money at the problem and

86
00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:55.050
influence their congressmen representatives,
not just tactically and,
uh,

87
00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:59.870
by sending specious materials and stuff to the congressional step,

88
00:05:59.871 --> 00:06:04.850
but strategically working statewide or Commonwealth wide and Kentucky,

89
00:06:04.851 --> 00:06:08.450
Tennessee and so on,
to the point where you don't,

90
00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:10.370
it's no trouble at all to meet people go,

91
00:06:10.371 --> 00:06:14.330
I don't know if climate change really happening.
Yeah,
it really is.
Yeah.

92
00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:19.730
So a,
it's a big problem and it's,
it's almost unique to United States.

93
00:06:19.731 --> 00:06:22.750
There's very few climate deniers and other,
and you,
UK,

94
00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:23.930
there's quite a few I guess,

95
00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:28.640
but at a recent summit of the 20 largest economies,

96
00:06:28.641 --> 00:06:31.220
the United States was isolated,
you know,

97
00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:34.300
doesn't want to participate in the Paris agreement and so on.

98
00:06:34.301 --> 00:06:37.100
It's just one word for it would be silly,

99
00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:41.570
but another one would be deeply concerning.
That's two words,
but it's like,

100
00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:45.500
it's like,
uh,
no.
And what would he,
what do you think that the path is?
You know,

101
00:06:45.501 --> 00:06:48.080
there's,
there's the science behind the reality,

102
00:06:48.081 --> 00:06:51.590
but then there's also the reality of politics.

103
00:06:51.591 --> 00:06:54.650
The social engineering that maybe needs to be factored in.

104
00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:58.370
How do we get to the place that we need to be?
Well,

105
00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:01.070
climate deniers in this one case,

106
00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:04.520
not so much anti-vaxxers uh,

107
00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:08.030
a number of climate deniers are almost universally old.

108
00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:13.250
They're almost all older people over 50 years old,

109
00:07:13.251 --> 00:07:18.110
67 years old.
People who control a lot of the money.
And,

110
00:07:18.111 --> 00:07:22.940
uh,
uh,
when those people age out,
as the saying goes,

111
00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:26.870
the,
uh,
the,
the other expression for that as die.

112
00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:32.380
Then the young people,
if you've ever seen the map,
maybe you guys generate it,

113
00:07:32.381 --> 00:07:33.320
it was survey monkey.

114
00:07:33.321 --> 00:07:37.400
There's a map of the electoral college have only millennials had voted,

115
00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:42.200
and it's overwhelming overwhelmingly the other way on social issues,

116
00:07:42.910 --> 00:07:44.540
especially climate change.

117
00:07:44.541 --> 00:07:49.541
So I think climate change deniers who are affiliated with conservative parties,

118
00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:53.990
uh,
are very much aware of that.
And so there's,

119
00:07:53.991 --> 00:07:58.991
there's a big hustle to get a very conservative judges put in place in the

120
00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:02.450
Supreme Court.
And to maintain this denial as long as possible,

121
00:08:02.451 --> 00:08:06.080
to get as many regulations turned over as possible,
as quickly as possible.

122
00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:11.440
But when you guys get to be the majority of the voting of the electorate,

123
00:08:12.750 --> 00:08:15.860
this will all have to be reversed and it will happen.

124
00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:19.520
But for people like me,
uh,

125
00:08:19.850 --> 00:08:23.810
my life will suck a little bit near the end.
But you guys,

126
00:08:23.811 --> 00:08:28.070
your lives will really star because once,

127
00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:33.050
once the,
the carbon dioxide methane stuff are in the atmosphere,

128
00:08:33.060 --> 00:08:36.410
they just don't get 'em out.
You know,
carbon dioxide last couple hundred years,

129
00:08:36.411 --> 00:08:38.360
it's,
it's cycle is about five years,

130
00:08:39.170 --> 00:08:42.200
but it gets replaced by another carbon dioxide molecule.

131
00:08:42.201 --> 00:08:45.410
And that it's going to go on for a couple of hundred years.
The analogy is a,

132
00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:49.640
you have a roast in the oven or a Turkey in the oven or wood.
I know.
Okay.

133
00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:52.790
This is use your imagination and vegans.
Just imagine

134
00:08:55.830 --> 00:08:57.120
after you take it out of the oven,

135
00:08:57.121 --> 00:09:01.350
the heat still working its way into the middle for a long time and that's what's

136
00:09:01.351 --> 00:09:02.670
going to happen to the earth.

137
00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:05.820
So we want to get to work on climate change as fast as we can.

138
00:09:05.850 --> 00:09:08.280
How much time do we have?
Well,
everybody argues about that.

139
00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:12.000
There are people will be around indefinitely.
You can't kill humans.

140
00:09:12.001 --> 00:09:12.834
They're crazy.

141
00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:18.150
You want to have the highest quality of life for as many people as possible.

142
00:09:18.990 --> 00:09:22.680
You know you don't want Santa Monica beach is cool.
Why Barry?

143
00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:24.870
Why put it underwater?
Right?
Come on.

144
00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:30.160
<v 0>Can I read a passage from your book?
What if I said no?</v>

145
00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:35.020
We'll go to the next question.
The whole thing?
Yeah.
Try it out loud.
Come on.

146
00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:40.040
unbelief.com didn't let him marry outside the roof off to dump blasted.

147
00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:44.080
So you write a lot of people.

148
00:09:44.110 --> 00:09:46.840
A lot of what I've done over the past four decades,

149
00:09:47.050 --> 00:09:50.980
including writing the book that you're reading now was inspired by the need to

150
00:09:50.981 --> 00:09:54.790
help people understand what it means to be a global species.

151
00:09:55.390 --> 00:09:58.570
The challenge is taking responsibility for our actions,

152
00:09:58.810 --> 00:10:02.620
assuming deliberate control of the change.
We're all in this together.

153
00:10:02.890 --> 00:10:05.920
Nerds don't give up when there's a problem to be solved,

154
00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:08.620
and so I've kept working on my climate message.

155
00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:13.230
We doubling my efforts to try everything all at once.
Yes.

156
00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:18.460
What have you been doing?
It is,
it is.
And thank you for that.
And what,

157
00:10:18.461 --> 00:10:21.570
what,
what have you been doing all at once?
Like this has really been your,

158
00:10:21.571 --> 00:10:23.080
your life?
Well,
I come here,

159
00:10:23.270 --> 00:10:27.110
<v 3>I wrote another book,
which takes time.
I don't know if you've tried it</v>

160
00:10:29.090 --> 00:10:32.960
and I go to college campuses,
I speak,
I go to the US Congress,

161
00:10:33.610 --> 00:10:37.910
I go to the astronautical congress,
which is a huge party of rocket people.

162
00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:43.600
And we talk about climate change and bill bill's big three clean water,

163
00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:48.110
renewable electricity and access to the Internet.
And for example,

164
00:10:48.111 --> 00:10:51.710
at the astronautical Congress to provide access to the Internet.

165
00:10:51.711 --> 00:10:56.711
In the developing world will almost certainly involve what we call space assets,

166
00:10:57.260 --> 00:11:02.260
what other people call satellites and they're going to have to be in low earth

167
00:11:02.271 --> 00:11:02.811
orbit,
you know,

168
00:11:02.811 --> 00:11:07.811
a constellation of a few hundred of them and they'll hand off the Internet a

169
00:11:08.630 --> 00:11:12.740
service from one to the other.
Uh,
the way we do with mobile phone calls,

170
00:11:13.330 --> 00:11:15.740
and this is all seems to be doable,

171
00:11:15.741 --> 00:11:18.950
but doing it at a reasonable cost and who's going to pay for it and who benefits

172
00:11:18.951 --> 00:11:19.850
and so on and so on.

173
00:11:20.510 --> 00:11:24.380
So these are issues that we can solve that you guys,

174
00:11:24.381 --> 00:11:27.970
especially with the efficiency of the Internet,
are going to be a huge part of,

175
00:11:27.990 --> 00:11:32.620
and I appreciate it,
man.
Woman.
Yeah.
So Kim,

176
00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:37.010
can you let,
let's switch gears a little bit.
Um,
to switch gears.
Older reference,

177
00:11:37.310 --> 00:11:38.050
electronic

<v 0>go off with,
many of you may have bicycle</v>

21 speed.

181
00:11:51.850 --> 00:11:54.430
<v 0>You talk a lot about the nerd mindset</v>

182
00:11:54.670 --> 00:11:58.950
<v 3>and really I know nothing about it and embracing it.
Yes.</v>

183
00:11:58.990 --> 00:12:03.700
He sought a fixie.
It's,
you know,
it's a 17 speed 21 sweet.
Yeah.
Sorry,
I'm sorry.

184
00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:07.300
So what is the nerd mindset?

185
00:12:07.330 --> 00:12:12.250
How do you show everybody's passionate about something,
right?

186
00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:14.110
You guys had Google especially,

187
00:12:14.111 --> 00:12:16.510
there's some thing that when you're in the business,
right,

188
00:12:16.540 --> 00:12:20.140
there's something that you think is cool and you're passionate about.

189
00:12:20.141 --> 00:12:25.030
We want to get everybody to harness that passion,
to accomplish great things,

190
00:12:25.031 --> 00:12:28.780
to save the world for humans.
You know,

191
00:12:28.781 --> 00:12:31.750
I remind her of what the Earth's going to be here.
No matter what we do,

192
00:12:32.290 --> 00:12:35.320
I want to save it for me,
the human,

193
00:12:36.490 --> 00:12:39.790
we're in the sixth extinction,
you know,
this is all very serious biz.

194
00:12:40.690 --> 00:12:44.950
We are now not just the ancient dinosaurs who were killed by the asteroid.

195
00:12:44.951 --> 00:12:48.730
We are also the asteroid or on both ends of this thing.

196
00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:51.250
So we can,
we can change,

197
00:12:51.251 --> 00:12:55.240
we have freewill or nominally we have free will certainly have the ability to

198
00:12:55.241 --> 00:12:58.330
reason.
So,
uh,

199
00:12:58.420 --> 00:13:02.560
I want everybody to harness their nerdiness and make the world better.

200
00:13:02.561 --> 00:13:06.370
And my claim for your evaluation is it,

201
00:13:06.371 --> 00:13:10.150
the people who wrote the u s constitution were nerds.

202
00:13:10.750 --> 00:13:12.220
They thought it was cool.

203
00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:16.690
We're going to have a brand new government without a king or queen,

204
00:13:16.930 --> 00:13:19.600
what yes,
going to be cool.
And uh,

205
00:13:20.350 --> 00:13:24.640
it'll be like Athens only on a whole continent size scale.

206
00:13:25.450 --> 00:13:28.150
And yes,
to be sure there were some issues,

207
00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:31.780
some issues of people of your ancestry.
Okay.
Uh,

208
00:13:31.810 --> 00:13:33.780
but they were doing the best they could at the time.

209
00:13:33.820 --> 00:13:37.210
I think at the time doing the best they could,
but they were nerves.

210
00:13:37.211 --> 00:13:41.900
They looked at this at running a government,
uh,
with a,
um,

211
00:13:42.820 --> 00:13:47.740
with an analytic or a critical thinking perspective,
you know,
Article One,

212
00:13:47.741 --> 00:13:52.741
section eight U s constitution or first to the progress of science and useful

213
00:13:52.961 --> 00:13:57.190
arts.
That's US people.
Useful arts,

214
00:13:57.191 --> 00:14:01.710
I think in a 18th century speak was engineering,
you know,

215
00:14:02.030 --> 00:14:06.010
making buildings and sewer systems and stuff like that,
the useful arts.

216
00:14:06.730 --> 00:14:07.563
And uh,

217
00:14:09.430 --> 00:14:13.990
now they are you guys,
people have said to Molech and we'll get back to work,

218
00:14:13.991 --> 00:14:17.470
but people have said,
hey,
Bill Nye,

219
00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:19.660
what's the most important invention ever?

220
00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:23.010
And you can tell they want me to say the Google phone,
you know?

221
00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:29.590
But to me the most important invention humans comes up is a sewer.
Absolutely.

222
00:14:30.250 --> 00:14:34.420
You could not have any city like this without a sewer system.
And it takes,

223
00:14:34.530 --> 00:14:35.770
you've got to be thoughtful.

224
00:14:36.370 --> 00:14:39.790
I mean you got to plan on a city size scale.

225
00:14:40.390 --> 00:14:43.300
So Viva La Sueur,

226
00:14:45.460 --> 00:14:47.790
now you talk about the,
the,

227
00:14:47.791 --> 00:14:52.791
the nerd mindset and how it should really be applied to big problems.

228
00:14:52.940 --> 00:14:54.870
And,
and you make a distinction between the,

229
00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:59.120
the big problems in the trivial problems.
Can you talk,
what's a trivial problem?

230
00:14:59.810 --> 00:15:03.050
Like your shoe laces?
See

231
00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:06.350
he has to double knot as

232
00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:10.070
she and the guy next to her

233
00:15:13.810 --> 00:15:17.940
mommy.
Same.
Not the stays here all day.
Doesn't come on.

234
00:15:18.030 --> 00:15:20.990
You'd have to double knockers they'd come and tied,
right?
But they do,

235
00:15:20.991 --> 00:15:23.540
they have the word breaks my heart.

236
00:15:23.541 --> 00:15:27.650
The phrase breaks my heart does not do enough I think just crushes me.

237
00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:31.760
So every day I look out and see the miss tied shoes

238
00:15:33.650 --> 00:15:38.630
and I realized my life's kind of been a waste
now.

239
00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:43.220
Now here's the thing
that's going to close up.
If we can.
Well,

240
00:15:43.221 --> 00:15:47.630
it's just that these are shoe laces or bow tie ins.

241
00:15:48.140 --> 00:15:52.520
Everybody's familiar with this expression and overhead.
Not you won one,

242
00:15:53.030 --> 00:15:56.000
not one.
A wrap around the other string.

243
00:15:56.870 --> 00:16:00.560
If I were to do this,
oh,
it's hard to do.

244
00:16:00.561 --> 00:16:05.561
It's so troubling where you're not goes up and down your shoe like this as yours

245
00:16:05.571 --> 00:16:06.860
does.
When you start,
right,

246
00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:10.690
there's the loads on this nod or uneven there.

247
00:16:10.700 --> 00:16:15.410
Unsymmetrical so this not comes untied readily.
Yes.

248
00:16:15.411 --> 00:16:17.240
It's heartbreaking.
Yes,
it sucks.

249
00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:23.840
But what you want is for the not to be square,
symmetrical.
No.

250
00:16:23.841 --> 00:16:28.220
Notice if I pull these a breath or other way,
Bill.
Dude,

251
00:16:29.620 --> 00:16:31.940
if you pull them this way,
you end up with a square.

252
00:16:31.941 --> 00:16:35.090
Not a beautiful symmetrical square.
Not for any sailors here.

253
00:16:35.091 --> 00:16:38.090
This is also called a reef,
not for reefing.

254
00:16:38.091 --> 00:16:43.010
The sales for making the sale smaller and strong.
When I,
it's a real thing.

255
00:16:43.060 --> 00:16:46.260
Reefing is sales a real thing?
We do have a close.
I see.
Yeah.
Yeah.

256
00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:51.860
So this is what you want in your bow is a square bow.

257
00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:57.380
So you're saying that's trivial.
All the shoes walking around the earth.

258
00:16:58.200 --> 00:17:02.580
Miss tide.
Just thinking

259
00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:09.620
I'm okay.
Yes,
lead on Malique,

260
00:17:10.370 --> 00:17:11.150
but by the way,

261
00:17:11.150 --> 00:17:15.470
I think you just created the well will be the number one how to video on
youtube.

262
00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:18.130
This,
this little bump here.

263
00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:23.690
Please get a close up.

264
00:17:26.220 --> 00:17:28.260
We'll wait till you're an up and close.

265
00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:34.340
Maybe they're probably not listening.
That's there are.
There we go.
We got it.

266
00:17:34.341 --> 00:17:36.980
We got it.
It's an overhand knot,
right?

267
00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:42.050
That's an overhand overhand knot or whatever you want to call it.

268
00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:43.820
One string around the other.

269
00:17:44.540 --> 00:17:48.170
Then you got to make a loop on your shoe can.
We can't really,

270
00:17:48.171 --> 00:17:50.830
we can't do this too fast on your,

271
00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:58.170
you make a loop.
Now whether you do it this way or make bunny ears,

272
00:17:58.171 --> 00:17:59.070
it works the same,

273
00:18:00.450 --> 00:18:03.630
but you go around the loop with the other one and then you got to poke that

274
00:18:03.631 --> 00:18:08.610
through to create the other half of the bow.
This is not,
you know,

275
00:18:08.611 --> 00:18:12.600
controversial.
So here,

276
00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:18.190
don't worry about that.
Here you got to make it a loop.

277
00:18:18.230 --> 00:18:22.320
Same idea and then by tradition,
the way I was brought up,

278
00:18:22.321 --> 00:18:26.490
you have this one go over the top that way.
Gravity is helps.
Yeah.

279
00:18:26.491 --> 00:18:31.470
So what if you're in zero gravity?
I seldom
can always hope.

280
00:18:32.780 --> 00:18:35.850
So the key to what you guys,
you have to preserve a place.

281
00:18:35.851 --> 00:18:39.120
So when this is wrapped around your finger,
there's still space there.

282
00:18:39.930 --> 00:18:44.640
And then you push this through,
you know as we do,

283
00:18:45.030 --> 00:18:48.510
there we go.
And so then you have to with any not,

284
00:18:48.690 --> 00:18:52.620
you have to dress the not you have to snug and tight.
It's not magic.

285
00:18:53.610 --> 00:18:54.930
It's not rocket surgery.

286
00:18:54.990 --> 00:18:59.990
You just have to tighten it evenly and then you have it a boat.

287
00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:01.753
And

288
00:19:03.010 --> 00:19:05.830
<v 2>thank you bill Nye tied,
tied his own.</v>

289
00:19:08.170 --> 00:19:13.090
<v 3>So then when you have a bow tie,
I don't see a lot of ties here at Google,</v>

290
00:19:13.091 --> 00:19:17.980
but when you lean over,
it doesn't slip into the soup.

291
00:19:17.981 --> 00:19:21.850
It does not flip and flop into your flask.
And so,
uh,

292
00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:26.350
this is the why you wear a bow tie and you watched the Oscars or whatever.

293
00:19:26.351 --> 00:19:30.700
And the guys are all in Tuxedos.
They wear a bow tie once in a while.

294
00:19:30.701 --> 00:19:33.550
A golf show up with a single button cause he's so cool.

295
00:19:34.060 --> 00:19:37.990
Or a black tie on a black shirt with a black,
okay.
Whatever.

296
00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:41.770
When you're dressed up,
you wear black tie and white shirt.
That's,

297
00:19:41.771 --> 00:19:46.771
you don't wear a blue shirt when you're dressed up at a Tuxedo in a Tuxedo and a

298
00:19:47.221 --> 00:19:49.980
[inaudible] everybody,
this is us.
When you're dressed up,
you wear a bow tie.

299
00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:52.870
People that's awesome.
Saying,
uh,

300
00:19:53.410 --> 00:19:57.070
cannot be t dubs as the kids say.

301
00:19:57.520 --> 00:20:01.120
Just this morning Bill Nye saves the world was nominated for two Emmy.

302
00:20:01.121 --> 00:20:01.954
So it's cool.

303
00:20:03.310 --> 00:20:05.980
<v 2>Don't come running to me.
I'll go.</v>

304
00:20:07.410 --> 00:20:09.180
<v 3>Although I am one of the writers,</v>

305
00:20:09.210 --> 00:20:13.350
you're only allowed to give to put five names on it.
So we,
I,

306
00:20:13.530 --> 00:20:15.840
we have five names of the,
some of the other writers.

307
00:20:15.841 --> 00:20:19.960
Prashanth Vencat CC pleasance,
Mike Drucker,
uh,

308
00:20:20.860 --> 00:20:24.270
uh,
sand and Totten.
And um,
did I mention CC?

309
00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:29.010
I did and I mentioned Mike.
Uh,
I'm fine.
Michael Naidus is not,

310
00:20:29.011 --> 00:20:33.290
nor am I.
We're not on it.
So,
uh,
it's gonna be,
it's gonna be,
you know,

311
00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:36.360
you don't get,
you don't win the first time,
but it's always cool to be there.

312
00:20:36.570 --> 00:20:41.190
And I'll wear a Tux and I also wear sweaters.
I wear pants,

313
00:20:41.410 --> 00:20:44.370
civics,
everybody there wears pants.

314
00:20:44.371 --> 00:20:47.010
All the guys working ladies don't though.

315
00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:52.240
So we'd love to go on too fast.
Oh,
this is,
this is excellent.

316
00:20:52.950 --> 00:20:55.270
I would love to talk about,
um,

317
00:20:55.640 --> 00:20:57.850
<v 0>when,
when you grew up,
grew up growing up.</v>

318
00:20:57.851 --> 00:21:01.360
You tell us so many great stories about,
um,
uh,

319
00:21:01.420 --> 00:21:06.220
we're wearing a bow tie and a,
your parents,
your,
your dad,

320
00:21:06.221 --> 00:21:06.630
your,
yeah,

321
00:21:06.630 --> 00:21:10.580
<v 3>my dad showed me how to tie a bow tie around my leg.
Try it.</v>

322
00:21:10.650 --> 00:21:15.020
This is about the same diameter is your neck,
so you can practice a,

323
00:21:15.090 --> 00:21:18.940
around your leg during one of your Netflix weekends

324
00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:25.240
<v 0>and,
and your,
your mom was a and an innovator.
She out of college,</v>

325
00:21:25.241 --> 00:21:30.010
I think it was,
um,
went into the military to crack codes.

326
00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:32.310
<v 3>Yeah.
Well she was recruited.
She was recruited.</v>

327
00:21:32.311 --> 00:21:37.311
So my dad was a couple of years older than my mother was very traditional and he

328
00:21:38.311 --> 00:21:42.900
wanted to build up the nest egg for them in her father would not let them get

329
00:21:42.901 --> 00:21:47.730
married until she was graduated from college.
I mean,
this is in,

330
00:21:48.570 --> 00:21:53.220
my dad went to Johns Hopkins in Baltimore and my mom went to Goucher College,

331
00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:57.840
which used to be the sister school to Hopkins Women Only.

332
00:21:57.841 --> 00:22:02.830
But now they let boys and my mom would say,
you know,
it's gone to help.
But
uh,

333
00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:07.020
she was all women and the,
uh,
she'll,
she was,

334
00:22:07.260 --> 00:22:12.260
my dad went before the u s navy had the CBS before that existed,

335
00:22:14.430 --> 00:22:16.470
they hired,
uh,
contractors,

336
00:22:16.471 --> 00:22:19.530
construction firms to do heavy lifting.

337
00:22:20.130 --> 00:22:25.130
So my dad got a job at a construction company on wake island and a,

338
00:22:25.321 --> 00:22:28.590
if you've ever heard of it,
you go to Hawaii and then you go that far again,

339
00:22:28.591 --> 00:22:31.350
another 5,000 nautical miles out in the middle of nowhere.

340
00:22:31.350 --> 00:22:36.090
There's an a toll that's tactically important.
You can refuel a ship there.

341
00:22:36.091 --> 00:22:40.590
And this word,
they used to refuel the flying boats,
the Boeing clipper airplane.

342
00:22:41.730 --> 00:22:45.870
And uh,
anyway,
they were bombed on December 8th,
1941,

343
00:22:45.871 --> 00:22:48.030
which was December 7th in Pearl Harbor.

344
00:22:48.031 --> 00:22:51.510
It's the same day because of the international dateline WIC.

345
00:22:51.511 --> 00:22:55.320
WIC is a beyond the international dateline wind flowing east to west.
And,
um,

346
00:22:56.070 --> 00:22:58.260
so he was a prisoner of war for four years.

347
00:22:58.380 --> 00:23:02.010
If you get a chance to be a prisoner of war,
don't

348
00:23:03.690 --> 00:23:04.523
suck.

349
00:23:05.070 --> 00:23:09.210
But my mom was graduated in 1942 that spring,

350
00:23:09.660 --> 00:23:14.280
her boyfriend and disappeared,
uh,
there,
there were bombed,

351
00:23:14.281 --> 00:23:17.040
the radio was destroyed.
They had no communication.

352
00:23:17.041 --> 00:23:21.880
They didn't have Facebook or youtube or Twitter.
Right.

353
00:23:22.070 --> 00:23:25.710
I know.
Yeah.
What did they do all day?
I don't know.
They did something.
Yeah.

354
00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:32.220
Uh,
and so,
so,
uh,

355
00:23:32.250 --> 00:23:33.740
the head of gout collared,

356
00:23:33.850 --> 00:23:37.950
the dean of students had voucher was Dorothy Stimson who was the first cousin of

357
00:23:37.951 --> 00:23:42.840
Henry Stimson who was the secretary of war.
And this is back in the day,

358
00:23:42.841 --> 00:23:44.820
everybody,
he apparently said to her,

359
00:23:44.821 --> 00:23:48.110
do you any ladies that can come work on this thing?
I can't tell you what it is.

360
00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:50.870
So my mom worked on the enigma code,

361
00:23:50.900 --> 00:23:54.560
which there's notorious thing and World War II and my whole life people would

362
00:23:54.561 --> 00:23:57.770
ask her,
what did you do during the war?
Can't talk about it.

363
00:23:58.120 --> 00:24:01.730
I can't talk about it.
And they had a big party.

364
00:24:01.731 --> 00:24:06.731
They were declassified in 1992 50 freaking years after they were recruited.

365
00:24:08.871 --> 00:24:13.110
And they still wouldn't,
my nephew tried to do a report and they still would,

366
00:24:13.111 --> 00:24:15.290
none of them.
There were seven ladies there at that point.

367
00:24:15.291 --> 00:24:20.240
They would not talk about it.
It was,
uh,
it was the thing.
It was a fang.
Wow.

368
00:24:20.300 --> 00:24:24.850
Wow.
Wow,
wow.
And then incredible.
Groundbreaker um,
your,

369
00:24:24.851 --> 00:24:29.160
your mom can,
can you talk about her influence on you and say,
Oh yeah.

370
00:24:29.161 --> 00:24:32.090
So my mom,
you know this expression,
teach a man to fish.

371
00:24:32.810 --> 00:24:37.370
My mom was big on teacher,
won't give a woman officially today teach,

372
00:24:37.371 --> 00:24:41.600
teach a woman officially the rest of your life.
I can,
so I can cook,

373
00:24:41.630 --> 00:24:43.790
I can do the dishes.
I have some,
I can vacuum.

374
00:24:44.300 --> 00:24:48.140
I have some competency because she made us learn to do those things.

375
00:24:48.590 --> 00:24:50.960
I still have two sewing machines.
It's more,
but you know,

376
00:24:50.990 --> 00:24:54.260
one of them is really good for zigzag.
I don't have to tell you,

377
00:24:55.130 --> 00:24:57.490
<v 2>but,
uh,
uh,</v>

378
00:24:57.790 --> 00:24:58.571
<v 3>my ladies,</v>

379
00:24:58.571 --> 00:25:03.571
my mom marched in the equal rights amendment parade in 1973.

380
00:25:04.500 --> 00:25:06.190
<v 2>Thank you.
Yes,
I didn't do it.</v>

381
00:25:07.970 --> 00:25:11.810
<v 3>And she tells,
I mean,
she said she threw her bra and the fire.</v>

382
00:25:12.020 --> 00:25:14.810
I don't know if she really did,
but that's what she said she did.

383
00:25:15.230 --> 00:25:18.530
I was not in a position to verify that

384
00:25:21.500 --> 00:25:24.410
this is before the woman's march.
This is 1973,

385
00:25:24.411 --> 00:25:27.890
and that the legacy of those days is with us now.
I mean,
look,

386
00:25:27.891 --> 00:25:32.690
half the employees at Google,
here are women in my parents time.

387
00:25:32.691 --> 00:25:37.550
That was not the case.
You know?
Uh,
there were very,
very,
very few women engineers.

388
00:25:37.620 --> 00:25:42.530
Nobody's,
no women computer coders back then.
Very,
very few.
So,

389
00:25:42.531 --> 00:25:46.760
uh,
she was part of that vanguard and,
and then,

390
00:25:47.540 --> 00:25:50.990
uh,
I get it.
I mean,
I say all the time,
half the humans are women and girls.

391
00:25:50.991 --> 00:25:55.130
So it's half,
half the engineers and scientists,
women what,
what,

392
00:25:55.610 --> 00:26:00.140
<v 2>you're twice as many brands,
right?
It will be good or braids.</v>

393
00:26:00.141 --> 00:26:01.190
Women are better at everything.

394
00:26:01.250 --> 00:26:05.810
<v 3>Okay.
All right.
And we sell it.
We planned the hand.
I was dealt with here.</v>

395
00:26:05.811 --> 00:26:10.550
I'm a guy.
All right.
We still have more work to do.
You know,

396
00:26:10.551 --> 00:26:13.010
where I guess we're not,

397
00:26:14.060 --> 00:26:16.490
how do we encourage more diversity?

398
00:26:16.491 --> 00:26:21.140
More women and girls to get into diversity.
I mean Malique I'm checking you out.

399
00:26:21.170 --> 00:26:24.610
I think you've probably been through some things that I can't even imagine,
uh,

400
00:26:24.720 --> 00:26:26.600
on account of your ancestry.
Right.

401
00:26:27.350 --> 00:26:31.370
Nobody just pulls me over driving while Dorky white guy.

402
00:26:33.770 --> 00:26:38.720
So,
uh,
uh,
anyway,
uh,
we subprocess everybody.

403
00:26:38.721 --> 00:26:41.990
We just gotta stick with it.
You can have high expectations,

404
00:26:41.991 --> 00:26:46.991
but I encourage everybody not to let your fury you get in the way of getting

405
00:26:47.191 --> 00:26:50.820
things done.
You know,
we're all ticked off about something,
not me.

406
00:26:50.970 --> 00:26:52.800
Of course I'm the smooth.

407
00:26:54.780 --> 00:26:56.130
So it's a long journey,

408
00:26:56.160 --> 00:27:01.160
but I guess you support people shouldn't base on merit rather than ancestry or

409
00:27:01.980 --> 00:27:04.770
gender.
That's right.
Well thanks bill.

410
00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:07.950
<v 2>Yeah,
thanks.
Obvious.</v>

411
00:27:08.170 --> 00:27:10.930
Avi as the kids say Avi.

412
00:27:12.220 --> 00:27:13.660
So Bill Nye

413
00:27:13.750 --> 00:27:17.350
<v 3>the science guy and then there's Bill Nye the comedy guy.</v>

414
00:27:17.980 --> 00:27:22.750
One in the same.
Sure.
And it's not only on my funny,
I'm what?

415
00:27:22.820 --> 00:27:25.050
Bill leak.
That's right.
Funny.
Yes.

416
00:27:28.450 --> 00:27:29.850
<v 2>And I thought it was so</v>

417
00:27:30.370 --> 00:27:32.560
<v 3>interesting,
the comedy.</v>

418
00:27:32.561 --> 00:27:36.100
So can you tell us about your experience in standup comedy?

419
00:27:36.101 --> 00:27:41.101
And so what happened was a guy I would have been freshman roommate with in

420
00:27:43.151 --> 00:27:46.900
college,
I went into mechanical engineering.
He went into material science,

421
00:27:46.930 --> 00:27:51.560
Dave lax and,
but we still stayed in touch.
We've just,
uh,

422
00:27:51.580 --> 00:27:55.540
would go to school and buildings next to each other on the engineering

423
00:27:55.541 --> 00:27:56.890
quadrangle at Cornell.

424
00:27:56.891 --> 00:28:01.660
And one afternoon he comes hurrying to my house.

425
00:28:01.661 --> 00:28:05.920
We live near each other,
uh,
in Ithaca,
New York in this area called college town.

426
00:28:06.790 --> 00:28:11.100
And um,
he came her and you got to see this,
you won't believe this.

427
00:28:11.101 --> 00:28:14.230
You got to come see this.
So he had this crazy new thing.

428
00:28:14.950 --> 00:28:18.070
In 1977,
he had cable television.

429
00:28:18.970 --> 00:28:20.140
Whoa dude.

430
00:28:20.770 --> 00:28:25.770
And so they had on there was running in the rotation was Steve Martin at the

431
00:28:25.841 --> 00:28:29.160
boarding house,
which was a nightclub in San Francis still there.

432
00:28:29.190 --> 00:28:32.890
The boarding house is still a revered,
nice,
like whiskey or Gogo kind of thing.

433
00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:35.850
Been there for years and years.
And uh,

434
00:28:35.860 --> 00:28:39.280
so it was Steve Martin and I went and looked at it and the guy,
he's Dave said,

435
00:28:39.281 --> 00:28:41.950
look,
this guy is just like,
you look at this.
He's just like,

436
00:28:41.951 --> 00:28:46.650
he was sensibility is just like you who showed the slide two,
slide two.

437
00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:49.073
<v 2>So</v>

438
00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:53.620
<v 3>there are just,
they're distinguishable.</v>

439
00:28:53.840 --> 00:28:54.673
<v 2>No.</v>

440
00:28:56.150 --> 00:28:58.220
<v 3>So then a year later,</v>

441
00:28:58.221 --> 00:29:02.150
Warner brothers records sponsored a Steve Martin lookalike contest.

442
00:29:02.930 --> 00:29:06.890
And by then I'd been recruited by Boeing.
I was living in Seattle,

443
00:29:07.280 --> 00:29:11.980
working in Everett,
Washington for you zip code buffs,
Everett Washington,

444
00:29:11.990 --> 00:29:16.990
right on world's largest volume building where they build at that time,

445
00:29:17.901 --> 00:29:21.740
seven 47.
Now they built seven,
seven,
seven,
seven 87.

446
00:29:22.580 --> 00:29:27.290
Uh,
and uh,
so I entered that and I won.
I mean,

447
00:29:27.291 --> 00:29:29.960
I want,
it was,
I claim,

448
00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:35.060
as I told Steve when I met him once,
I haven't met him.

449
00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:36.673
Uh,

450
00:29:36.890 --> 00:29:40.880
I strongly believe that I got what he was driving at in a way that the

451
00:29:41.140 --> 00:29:44.500
contestants did this absurdist view of the world.

452
00:29:44.980 --> 00:29:46.810
I did not win the national one.

453
00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:51.880
That guy was from Nashville.
He could play the Banjo for crying out loud.

454
00:29:51.910 --> 00:29:55.150
Steve Martin,
if you know,
he's well known,
he's won grammys for his banjo playing.

455
00:29:56.170 --> 00:30:00.880
Uh,
but he also kind of looked like him,
which was a step I didn't really take.

456
00:30:00.940 --> 00:30:05.710
So,
uh,
anyway,
after you get laughs,
you know,
it's very,

457
00:30:05.711 --> 00:30:09.550
uh,
inspiring.
It's addicting.
You want to get laughs all the time.

458
00:30:09.730 --> 00:30:14.170
So I started doing standup comedy and then I met some people,

459
00:30:14.171 --> 00:30:19.171
some guys who were being groomed or recruited by the Seattle,

460
00:30:20.681 --> 00:30:24.640
a NBC affiliate station,
k I n.
G.

461
00:30:25.450 --> 00:30:29.770
Um,
Seattle's in King County,
Washington.

462
00:30:30.280 --> 00:30:31.001
And by the way,

463
00:30:31.001 --> 00:30:35.290
it's been retroactively named King County on account of Martin Luther King.

464
00:30:35.450 --> 00:30:39.880
Oh Wow.
Who was was not around in the 1850s,
but a,

465
00:30:39.881 --> 00:30:42.190
it's charming.
Anyway,

466
00:30:42.580 --> 00:30:47.470
they wanted to have a comedy show and so they asked me to be in a couple bits

467
00:30:47.471 --> 00:30:49.210
and it was funny or funny enough.

468
00:30:49.870 --> 00:30:53.610
And then I eventually quit my job after awhile,

469
00:30:53.620 --> 00:30:57.080
October 3rd,
1986 roughly.
And,
um,

470
00:31:00.460 --> 00:31:02.500
and because I,
at that time,

471
00:31:02.501 --> 00:31:06.720
you guys computerated design and a career as a manufacturer,

472
00:31:06.730 --> 00:31:09.970
commuter and machining,
we're just coming on.
It was like this new thing.

473
00:31:10.630 --> 00:31:13.300
Do you guys,
you compete with Katia or do you own them?

474
00:31:14.550 --> 00:31:19.240
You probably own them anyway.
It was new technology and I felt that if I,

475
00:31:19.280 --> 00:31:23.350
uh,
dropped out of engineering,
even for six months,

476
00:31:23.420 --> 00:31:27.600
I wouldn't be able to,
uh,
rejoined,
get back in the,
you know,

477
00:31:27.730 --> 00:31:32.500
Seattle was not silicon valley,
but sort of,
and I worked at Boeing and then,

478
00:31:32.501 --> 00:31:33.140
um,

479
00:31:33.140 --> 00:31:38.140
the company called Sun Strand would makes all the black boxes for airplanes and

480
00:31:39.170 --> 00:31:44.170
which is now Honeywell.
They got bought out.
But,
uh,
uh,

481
00:31:44.171 --> 00:31:47.230
I just,
I've took a chance and it worked out.

482
00:31:47.231 --> 00:31:51.370
It just kept making a living and then eventually I,
uh,

483
00:31:51.550 --> 00:31:53.050
I was so I would work part time.

484
00:31:53.051 --> 00:31:57.190
I was one of the last guys as loose as far as I knew on the last guys or work on

485
00:31:57.191 --> 00:31:58.920
a drawing board,
you know,
with uh,

486
00:31:59.740 --> 00:32:04.690
with the led holders or we don't call them pencils.
Oh No.
And um,

487
00:32:04.940 --> 00:32:06.070
electric eraser,

488
00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:11.080
a little racing shield to lay out these big things like this big sheets of paper

489
00:32:11.560 --> 00:32:15.610
to make these tiny instruments.
Sorry.

490
00:32:16.790 --> 00:32:20.260
No,
you'd lay it out 10 to one,
sometimes a hundred to one to make things,

491
00:32:20.261 --> 00:32:22.180
you know,
that are as big as a watch.

492
00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:26.410
You know how the accelerometer in a competitive product can tell you which way

493
00:32:26.411 --> 00:32:29.740
the phone's oriented.
It was the early days of that stuff.

494
00:32:30.250 --> 00:32:33.460
Lithography and very small scale.
So,
uh,
anyway,

495
00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:35.530
it took a long time.

496
00:32:35.790 --> 00:32:39.530
I quit my job in 86 and they started doing the science guy show and we did a

497
00:32:39.531 --> 00:32:44.180
pilot in 1992.
Wow.
Wow.
So six years of,
you know,
dinking around.

498
00:32:44.300 --> 00:32:48.350
Yeah.
Trying to,
um,
we did the landmark and important video,

499
00:32:48.351 --> 00:32:53.351
fabulous wetlands about how great wetlands are and that was sort of served as a

500
00:32:54.441 --> 00:32:57.500
template for the show with Jim Mckenna and Aaron Gotlieb.

501
00:32:57.530 --> 00:32:59.420
These other producers I fell in with.

502
00:33:00.200 --> 00:33:04.550
Does that answer your question or did you want to take up the whole hour talking

503
00:33:04.551 --> 00:33:06.800
about these details?
This one of your people?

504
00:33:08.280 --> 00:33:13.030
<v 0>I guess the guy's like six feet tall housing.
Not yet,
but getting there,</v>

505
00:33:13.060 --> 00:33:17.690
he's like five,
10 isn't freezing all lookout,
dad,
look out.

506
00:33:19.130 --> 00:33:24.100
Um,
so you know,
you're,
you're probably one of the only people who have,
uh,

507
00:33:24.160 --> 00:33:28.870
who,
who's gotten advice from both Jerry Seinfeld and Carl Sagan.
Yes,

508
00:33:28.900 --> 00:33:32.970
of course.
I roll with both.
You Roll an interesting circles.

509
00:33:33.960 --> 00:33:36.880
What was the advice that you got from Jerry Seiner?

510
00:33:37.220 --> 00:33:40.880
<v 3>Oh,
so you guys on his way up sign,</v>

511
00:33:40.940 --> 00:33:44.030
Jerry Seinfeld would come through Seattle on the circuit.
You know,
he'd go,

512
00:33:44.031 --> 00:33:48.410
Portland,
Oregon,
Seattle,
Vancouver,
British Columbia,
San Francisco,
New York,

513
00:33:48.411 --> 00:33:51.460
Chicago.
You know,
uh,
comedians,

514
00:33:51.490 --> 00:33:55.460
comedians still do it anyway,
when he was Nco,
you could,

515
00:33:56.030 --> 00:34:00.620
you could go have brunch with him on Sunday morning at this place,
either at,

516
00:34:00.920 --> 00:34:05.270
there's two Starbucks stores in Seattle that both claimed to be the first one,

517
00:34:06.500 --> 00:34:07.333
uh,

518
00:34:07.450 --> 00:34:11.600
at one of the first Starbucks is you could go there and have coffee with them on

519
00:34:11.601 --> 00:34:12.830
Sunday morning especially.

520
00:34:12.831 --> 00:34:17.690
And he said he liked to dress better than the audience.
That was his advice.

521
00:34:18.380 --> 00:34:20.600
And uh,
you know,
that's,

522
00:34:20.990 --> 00:34:24.170
if you watched the Seinfeld episodes in the beginning,

523
00:34:24.171 --> 00:34:28.570
we had a little standup thing.
He's in a sport coat and tie and a shirt.
Uh,

524
00:34:28.820 --> 00:34:33.530
but,
uh,
you look at Louis C K doesn't adhere to that rule at all,

525
00:34:33.560 --> 00:34:37.570
but I know,
I mean,
he doesn't,
he's a different deal and he's brilliant.
Uh,

526
00:34:37.730 --> 00:34:42.710
so I embrace that.
Then the other thing he said is,
when you're there,

527
00:34:43.070 --> 00:34:46.040
be there.
It's a real,

528
00:34:46.700 --> 00:34:50.120
when you start doing standup comedy,
you're nervous.

529
00:34:50.121 --> 00:34:54.110
You're a afraid that the audience will hate you,
which is very likely.

530
00:34:54.800 --> 00:34:56.360
And so you lose your focus.

531
00:34:56.361 --> 00:34:59.450
You get worried about what they're thinking of you rather than you're hilarious

532
00:34:59.451 --> 00:35:02.930
comedy jokes.
And so that was good advice.

533
00:35:02.931 --> 00:35:06.950
Those two little scraps of advice I have,
Helen,
I attributed to Mr Seinfeld.

534
00:35:06.980 --> 00:35:11.090
He was very nice to us,
to all of us.
Uh,
you know,

535
00:35:11.091 --> 00:35:13.910
it'd be young guys that he's 10 years older than I am kind of thing,

536
00:35:14.600 --> 00:35:18.770
and maybe he's less than that.
Well,
and he's a huge success,
you.

537
00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:21.060
And so,
uh,

538
00:35:21.680 --> 00:35:24.620
but those are two really good pieces of advice.

539
00:35:25.210 --> 00:35:29.240
<v 0>Let let,
let's,
I would love to talk about space and space.
Huge fans.</v>

540
00:35:29.540 --> 00:35:33.680
How many people are members?
The plan chairside?
Anybody?
Oh,
I suck.

541
00:35:34.970 --> 00:35:38.700
Thank you.
Yes.
So considered check us out of planetary.org.

542
00:35:38.730 --> 00:35:43.130
<v 3>Right,
right.
Dancing,
space science and exploration.
That's right.
That's right.
So,</v>

543
00:35:43.230 --> 00:35:44.920
so that's your day job,
so,
right.

544
00:35:45.120 --> 00:35:50.120
Can you talk about your day job is CEO of the Planetary Society.

545
00:35:50.161 --> 00:35:52.470
So you guys,
I,
you know,

546
00:35:52.471 --> 00:35:57.471
I worked for a lot of people and I make lots of jokes about my old boss.

547
00:35:57.930 --> 00:36:00.180
None of the jokes are flattering,

548
00:36:00.930 --> 00:36:05.190
but my old boss and what an idiot he was.
But there is no one old boss.

549
00:36:05.191 --> 00:36:06.240
It's an amalgam.

550
00:36:07.110 --> 00:36:10.530
You all work for fabulous bosses and you're always happy and no,

551
00:36:10.531 --> 00:36:14.970
there's no conflict here at Google news new.
Yes.
Uh,

552
00:36:15.390 --> 00:36:18.690
but now I'm in charge of,
you know,
a couple of few dozen people,

553
00:36:18.691 --> 00:36:23.420
30 people and I've learned a lot.
You,
uh,

554
00:36:23.490 --> 00:36:27.750
you want to work with people who are sharing the objective so that you're all

555
00:36:27.751 --> 00:36:32.530
trying to do the same thing and you want to work people that are competent but a

556
00:36:32.580 --> 00:36:36.270
competency is not all that difficult to come by.

557
00:36:36.270 --> 00:36:39.600
It's getting the chemistry,
getting the people together that can produce.

558
00:36:39.660 --> 00:36:42.540
And so I've learned a lot doing that.

559
00:36:42.541 --> 00:36:47.541
But what we want to do and at the planetary society is advance space science and

560
00:36:48.241 --> 00:36:50.250
exploration.
I submit to you,

561
00:36:51.080 --> 00:36:55.620
we are living at a time when we made discover life on another world.

562
00:36:56.490 --> 00:36:58.410
And if we were to find life on another world,

563
00:36:58.411 --> 00:36:59.940
it would change the course of human history.

564
00:36:59.970 --> 00:37:04.970
It would be like Copernicus showing the earth goes around the sun instead of the

565
00:37:05.071 --> 00:37:07.680
other way around.
Or Galileo,
you know the,

566
00:37:07.770 --> 00:37:11.220
I know the moon looks like a perfect circle,
but if you take this telescope,

567
00:37:11.221 --> 00:37:15.120
you can see it's full of bumps.
Well,
we're going to have to imprison you.
I know,

568
00:37:16.010 --> 00:37:18.810
but it's still full of bumps.
I'm sorry man.

569
00:37:20.340 --> 00:37:24.570
And uh,
you have to stay home the rest of your life.
Okay?
Whatever.

570
00:37:24.880 --> 00:37:29.880
Still bumps.
And so if we found life on Mars,

571
00:37:29.881 --> 00:37:32.520
for example,
or stranger still on Europa,

572
00:37:32.521 --> 00:37:37.380
the moon of Jupiter with twice as much seawater is the earth and would change

573
00:37:37.381 --> 00:37:38.910
everything.
I mean,
I'm not saying,

574
00:37:38.911 --> 00:37:43.410
I said [inaudible] not saying we'd suddenly drive on the left in the u s are not

575
00:37:43.411 --> 00:37:44.760
going to change everything,

576
00:37:45.510 --> 00:37:49.710
but it would change the way everybody feels about being alive in the cosmos.

577
00:37:49.740 --> 00:37:51.990
And so that's what the planetary society does.

578
00:37:51.991 --> 00:37:54.690
I was just at the planetary protection meeting.

579
00:37:55.770 --> 00:37:57.600
So it's the prime directive,
you know,

580
00:37:57.601 --> 00:38:02.100
you don't want to take human germs to Mars and contaminated so that you can't

581
00:38:02.101 --> 00:38:06.720
tell if there ever were any marsh and germs before you got there.
And it's a big,

582
00:38:06.750 --> 00:38:08.580
it's a nontrivial issue,
you know,

583
00:38:08.581 --> 00:38:13.380
getting spacecrafts sterile enough to do that and to get it with instruments

584
00:38:13.381 --> 00:38:17.550
that will detect something alive.
You know.
How do you know if it's alive or was,

585
00:38:17.551 --> 00:38:22.500
is it a fossilized Matt of ancient Mars crow bacteria things or what have you

586
00:38:23.430 --> 00:38:25.770
and who's going to pay for it?
That's our business.

587
00:38:25.771 --> 00:38:30.270
I go to the U S Congress a couple of times a year and hey this would be great

588
00:38:30.271 --> 00:38:35.260
man.
I say I paraphrase uh,
Mr Congressman.

589
00:38:35.290 --> 00:38:36.790
I think so.

590
00:38:37.240 --> 00:38:40.810
The other thing about space exploration that's really charming and wonderful.

591
00:38:40.840 --> 00:38:44.560
It brings out the best in us.
It really does.
You guys know Adam Schiff is,

592
00:38:44.920 --> 00:38:47.650
he's on the news all the time right now cause he's the head of the intelligence

593
00:38:47.651 --> 00:38:51.670
committee.
Some issue with Russia and some people,
some things,

594
00:38:52.420 --> 00:38:57.420
but he's also a huge supporter of exploring Europa because he's a big supporter

595
00:38:58.451 --> 00:39:00.340
of the jet propulsion lab in Pasadena.

596
00:39:01.240 --> 00:39:06.240
And then there's John Culberson from the Houston area who explained to me that

597
00:39:06.251 --> 00:39:11.251
really the safest place bill and probably in the country is the Texas State

598
00:39:11.261 --> 00:39:13.090
House.
And build what you do,

599
00:39:13.091 --> 00:39:17.320
get your concealed weapons permit and get in the concealed weapons line.

600
00:39:17.321 --> 00:39:20.560
Shortest line bill,
much fast.
You get,
everybody's got a weapon,

601
00:39:20.561 --> 00:39:24.370
nothing's going to happen there,
you know,
give him Mr Culberson.
Yes.
Anyway,

602
00:39:24.371 --> 00:39:29.371
he and Adam Schiff disagree about almost everything except the exploration of

603
00:39:29.921 --> 00:39:30.754
Europa.

604
00:39:31.180 --> 00:39:35.290
And they work to fund it all the time to go up what's so called flagship mission

605
00:39:35.320 --> 00:39:38.230
over a billion dollar mission,
$4 billion mission.

606
00:39:38.530 --> 00:39:42.880
Our mission is a space talk for rocket ship thing,

607
00:39:43.990 --> 00:39:48.190
mission.
It's a mission.
It's what it is.
You mean it's a satellite?
Yeah,
yeah.

608
00:39:48.191 --> 00:39:52.720
Whatever.
Uh,
but the mission involves all the people on the ground and so on.

609
00:39:52.721 --> 00:39:56.350
But they agree on this.
And I say to everybody,

610
00:39:56.351 --> 00:39:59.660
in the case of us where we are right now,
uh,

611
00:40:00.170 --> 00:40:04.720
NASA is the best brand.
The United States has theirs.

612
00:40:04.810 --> 00:40:08.320
You can meet people in other parts of world and hate the u s they hate me,

613
00:40:08.321 --> 00:40:11.140
that hate everything,
but they respect NASA.

614
00:40:11.860 --> 00:40:15.490
And so that alone is a worthy investment of our intellect and treasure.

615
00:40:15.491 --> 00:40:19.550
So I encourage you all to check out the planetary society.

616
00:40:19.551 --> 00:40:23.710
Is My briefcase over there.
Susan.
Susan's from Rodale.

617
00:40:23.711 --> 00:40:28.360
Press the company that printed the books.
Thank you,
Susan.
Yes,
hang on.

618
00:40:28.570 --> 00:40:29.420
This will be worth it.

619
00:40:32.530 --> 00:40:36.760
I injured my leg.
I'm a mess.
Hey,
my microphone works way over here.

620
00:40:37.330 --> 00:40:40.930
Thanks electronics.
So,
uh,

621
00:40:41.350 --> 00:40:44.980
this is a thing we want you to check out for the eclipse.
So that's my phone.

622
00:40:44.981 --> 00:40:49.510
Is that good to throw them on the floor?
Uh,
there's the planetary study logo.
Wow.

623
00:40:49.511 --> 00:40:50.350
Thanks bill.

624
00:40:51.160 --> 00:40:55.840
Is it a ringed planet or is it the letter P for planetary?
Wait,

625
00:40:55.841 --> 00:40:56.680
it's both.

626
00:40:59.050 --> 00:41:03.580
So these are eclipse glasses.
So,

627
00:41:03.581 --> 00:41:04.414
uh,

628
00:41:04.630 --> 00:41:08.890
you can't see a thing when you look right at the light.

629
00:41:08.900 --> 00:41:13.810
You see anything,
right?
Adam?
No.
Huh?
Uh,
nothing that ECL to anyway,

630
00:41:13.811 --> 00:41:16.570
so these are for sale checkout.
I like you.

631
00:41:16.600 --> 00:41:19.510
There's a woman owned business I've done business with for many years.

632
00:41:19.511 --> 00:41:22.450
Teacher source.com.
Uh,

633
00:41:22.600 --> 00:41:26.100
and the company's called education innovations and the market.

634
00:41:26.101 --> 00:41:27.460
And if for those of you,

635
00:41:27.461 --> 00:41:30.280
is there anybody here who does not have a bill Nye bobblehead

636
00:41:32.350 --> 00:41:35.750
wow.
It's so weird.
Anyway,
you also get those

637
00:41:37.490 --> 00:41:40.970
education innovations.
And so August 21st,

638
00:41:41.570 --> 00:41:46.190
there will be a clips going right across the world's third most populous
country.

639
00:41:46.191 --> 00:41:49.010
And I encourage all of you to get out there and get under it.

640
00:41:49.011 --> 00:41:51.830
If you've never seen a total eclipse,
it really is crazy.

641
00:41:52.460 --> 00:41:55.550
It's an amazing experience.
And uh,
it probably,

642
00:41:55.551 --> 00:41:57.170
it's very reasonable for most of us.

643
00:41:57.171 --> 00:42:02.171
It'll be a once in a lifetime thing because although there are two eclipses

644
00:42:02.631 --> 00:42:04.820
every two years due to the,

645
00:42:05.840 --> 00:42:09.320
of the planets and Sun except theirs,
it's in space.
There's no sound.
So,

646
00:42:11.120 --> 00:42:15.410
uh,
most of them are not over accessible land.

647
00:42:15.411 --> 00:42:19.790
That's easy for people in the u s to get to.
So a really encourage you,

648
00:42:19.791 --> 00:42:24.791
you drive somewhere and get under it and then you can make it a day trip.

649
00:42:26.360 --> 00:42:29.600
You know,
you can fly to Omaha,

650
00:42:30.110 --> 00:42:33.860
drive out under the eclipse and then go back to the airport and come back.

651
00:42:33.860 --> 00:42:36.980
I mean,
you don't have to rent a cabin in the woods for two years.

652
00:42:36.981 --> 00:42:40.760
I mean just go out there or if you're in the Atlanta area and just get an in

653
00:42:40.761 --> 00:42:44.540
Portland,
Oregon.
But I recommend you get east of the mountains.

654
00:42:44.541 --> 00:42:48.210
If you know your way around the northwest because west of the mountain,

655
00:42:48.211 --> 00:42:52.070
there's a good chance you'll get weathered out.
As we say.
If it's cloudy,

656
00:42:52.071 --> 00:42:56.450
you don't see anything and it really is amazing.
The Sky goes dark,

657
00:42:56.451 --> 00:43:00.920
you can see stars.
I'm hoping this one's going to be real and you're,
you're,

658
00:43:00.921 --> 00:43:02.870
you're going to get the ring around the sun.

659
00:43:02.871 --> 00:43:05.480
We're hoping to see these interference bands,
you know,

660
00:43:05.990 --> 00:43:10.990
the wavelengths of light make these gray bands go sweeping across the landscape

661
00:43:11.481 --> 00:43:15.020
is crazy.
Really is some I've seen one.
Yeah,
good one.

662
00:43:15.070 --> 00:43:18.890
When I was in South Africa for a meeting and it's really something,

663
00:43:19.160 --> 00:43:20.600
I've been near a couple of them,

664
00:43:20.601 --> 00:43:24.950
but really being under it this cool August 21st,

665
00:43:24.980 --> 00:43:28.410
August 21st.
Don't miss it if you can.
And uh,

666
00:43:28.560 --> 00:43:31.790
if you don't want to spend all that money on the plastic ones,

667
00:43:31.791 --> 00:43:35.460
there's paper and they're okay.
Uh,

668
00:43:35.470 --> 00:43:40.430
and they're also branded for Bill Nye and uh,
oh yeah.
You can see dimly.
Yeah.

669
00:43:40.431 --> 00:43:44.180
You can see the LEDs,
right?
Yeah,
exactly.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So a little bit,

670
00:43:44.540 --> 00:43:47.990
these modern lights,
uh,
are,
uh,

671
00:43:48.050 --> 00:43:51.560
they're no longer a single filament or a carbon arc and anything,
go ahead.

672
00:43:51.561 --> 00:43:55.370
There's a mixture of a little dots,
right?
Is this,

673
00:43:55.550 --> 00:44:00.380
is this your son here?
One of these people and we have one of them come up.
Yeah.

674
00:44:02.650 --> 00:44:07.310
What's her name?
Do you know?
John Henry.
So try those on.
Oh,

675
00:44:07.311 --> 00:44:11.620
look at you and look at the lights.
Do you see the mini colored dots?
Yeah,

676
00:44:11.830 --> 00:44:16.060
I have eye witness.
Yes.
All right.

677
00:44:16.130 --> 00:44:19.100
Nicely done.
Can I hold onto those?
I only got one.

678
00:44:21.860 --> 00:44:24.800
All right.
So we're,
we're,
we're gonna.
That's awesome.

679
00:44:24.801 --> 00:44:29.000
And we're going to go take questions from the audience and if we can go to slide

680
00:44:29.001 --> 00:44:32.220
six slide as we go to

681
00:44:32.580 --> 00:44:36.150
<v 0>audience questions,
I've got a question for the audience.</v>

682
00:44:36.780 --> 00:44:38.790
What do Bill Nye,
Rihanna,

683
00:44:38.791 --> 00:44:42.240
Jennifer Lawrence and Elon Musk have in common

684
00:44:44.370 --> 00:44:47.020
<v 2>that week?
Somebody said money.</v>

685
00:44:49.190 --> 00:44:51.710
Sorry.
So not yet.

686
00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:56.460
After we sell a few dozen of these plastic glasses,

687
00:44:59.460 --> 00:44:59.880
<v 0>you,</v>

688
00:44:59.880 --> 00:45:04.880
you are listed as one of the top celebrities along with the other three in the

689
00:45:05.191 --> 00:45:09.930
plural generation who are the generation of 13 to 20.

690
00:45:10.180 --> 00:45:11.940
Um,
uh,
some things,

691
00:45:12.050 --> 00:45:14.700
<v 3>uh,
yes.
Uh,
you're,
you're,
you're up there with those three.</v>

692
00:45:14.701 --> 00:45:18.870
So I'm considered a celebrity among people that age.

693
00:45:19.120 --> 00:45:19.953
<v 2>That's smell</v>

694
00:45:25.040 --> 00:45:28.970
<v 3>found as a celebrity among people of that age.
If you go,</v>

695
00:45:28.971 --> 00:45:33.971
if I go to a Starbucks in order a vanilla latte,

696
00:45:34.970 --> 00:45:38.900
it's $4.
Without that,
it's $4.

697
00:45:39.570 --> 00:45:41.500
<v 2>I tastic thing.</v>

698
00:45:46.070 --> 00:45:47.600
<v 3>All right,
questions from the audience.</v>

699
00:45:48.160 --> 00:45:51.080
I'm going to throw you this thing if you want to ask questions.
Um,

700
00:45:51.170 --> 00:45:55.060
because it has a microphone in it and it's a thing.
The blue thing.
Yeah,

701
00:45:55.790 --> 00:46:00.470
we can throw it.
It won't hurt you.
It's foamy.
Oh,
it's in her,
the ball cube.

702
00:46:00.620 --> 00:46:05.600
Yes.
So you roll it on the floor and see who picks it up.
Let's just try that.

703
00:46:06.740 --> 00:46:10.910
Not so fast.
Yeah,
he was making story real quick before I throw this at people.

704
00:46:10.940 --> 00:46:13.770
Uh,
we do have a bookseller right up side.

705
00:46:14.060 --> 00:46:16.430
We have subsidized copies of the book you've been hearing about.

706
00:46:16.880 --> 00:46:21.860
So please buy one if you want to read it.
Who has a question?
And I signed them,

707
00:46:21.861 --> 00:46:23.880
right?
Those are the ones that we did yesterday.
Yeah,

708
00:46:23.960 --> 00:46:26.780
I signed 550 of them yesterday.
Awesome.

709
00:46:26.840 --> 00:46:30.080
Took a few minutes and we can move off this slide with the fountain pen.

710
00:46:31.250 --> 00:46:35.770
If you're buying a book.
I love you man.
Showing some respect.
Yes.

711
00:46:35.780 --> 00:46:38.660
So we have a question.
Hi,
I'm Julian.

712
00:46:38.930 --> 00:46:43.190
Why are you raise your hand wave or their yard?
The blue thing?
Yes.
Um,

713
00:46:43.340 --> 00:46:47.830
what do you think that the government's role in science should be and what do

714
00:46:47.831 --> 00:46:52.190
you think it has been historically?
Well,
historically the government,

715
00:46:52.280 --> 00:46:55.820
our government anyway,
as supported science,
basic research,

716
00:46:56.270 --> 00:46:59.370
mostly at universities.
And then it trickles down.

717
00:46:59.371 --> 00:47:04.371
And then we have a whole thing or we used to call the Department of Education

718
00:47:05.400 --> 00:47:06.233
Studies,

719
00:47:06.660 --> 00:47:11.660
which studies how people learn and support schools,
public schools,

720
00:47:12.170 --> 00:47:16.230
which I attended.
Uh,
so,
uh,

721
00:47:16.250 --> 00:47:20.510
we reason we invest in science is to stay competitive,

722
00:47:20.960 --> 00:47:25.130
to innovate competitive and two ways economically on the world stage.

723
00:47:25.740 --> 00:47:29.080
Uh,
you know,
when people made fun of him.

724
00:47:29.081 --> 00:47:34.081
But when you build interstate highways that enabled people to come to work at

725
00:47:34.151 --> 00:47:34.984
Google,

726
00:47:35.380 --> 00:47:40.300
that is support as a form of supporting science.
Uh,
and then,

727
00:47:40.301 --> 00:47:43.450
uh,
the other thing is in national defense,

728
00:47:43.930 --> 00:47:47.520
weapons are almost all continually being innovated,

729
00:47:47.530 --> 00:47:51.310
being a modified and improved and made more effective.

730
00:47:51.850 --> 00:47:54.610
And the big thing,
nominally until recently,

731
00:47:54.611 --> 00:47:58.780
the big thing was to have cool weapons,
not used them.
And that was the big idea.

732
00:47:59.500 --> 00:48:03.280
But
it's getting weird peoples,

733
00:48:04.270 --> 00:48:08.560
it's getting weird.
So,
uh,
uh,

734
00:48:08.950 --> 00:48:10.630
government in my opinion,

735
00:48:10.631 --> 00:48:14.470
should invest in science and that's what keeps everybody competitive.

736
00:48:14.471 --> 00:48:15.041
There's a whole thing,

737
00:48:15.041 --> 00:48:19.920
you know where I was on the TV the other day with the uh,

738
00:48:20.410 --> 00:48:24.850
Grover Norquist guy who says he wants to shrink the government and drowned in a

739
00:48:24.880 --> 00:48:29.320
bathtub.
I don't think that's what you really want.
Like,
um,

740
00:48:29.620 --> 00:48:33.400
after that we just drive on either side of the street.
Is that okay?

741
00:48:34.120 --> 00:48:38.440
And no stop lights.
Cool.
Really Fun.
No fire departments.

742
00:48:38.441 --> 00:48:41.680
You sure about that?
So what happens with those guys in general?

743
00:48:41.681 --> 00:48:45.430
They've talked a good game until push comes to shove until the sewer backs up,

744
00:48:45.460 --> 00:48:48.700
until the military's not funded,
then they freak out.

745
00:48:49.270 --> 00:48:51.040
So uh,

746
00:48:51.070 --> 00:48:55.060
supporting basic research is very important and whatever innovations you all can

747
00:48:55.061 --> 00:48:58.480
do,
uh,
to help everybody,

748
00:48:58.481 --> 00:49:03.220
all the internet or information technology people around the world.
Thank you.

749
00:49:04.510 --> 00:49:06.990
Does that answer your question?
Yeah,
but thank you so much.

750
00:49:07.120 --> 00:49:10.840
Saying something like that and doing it is doing things.
Let's throw the mic.

751
00:49:10.900 --> 00:49:13.630
I think we've got a question over here and I want to see it through it.
Cause it,

752
00:49:13.860 --> 00:49:18.720
yes,
there you go.
You could have played pro ball.

753
00:49:18.720 --> 00:49:22.110
Yeah.
So since we know you're an advocate of the non useful arts,

754
00:49:22.111 --> 00:49:26.280
what would be your advice to those who pursue those as a Christian non useful

755
00:49:26.281 --> 00:49:26.911
art?
Well,

756
00:49:26.911 --> 00:49:30.060
you were making that joke that the founding fathers were referring to useful

757
00:49:30.061 --> 00:49:34.580
arts as engineering and science and but at nighttime century or the 18th
century,

758
00:49:34.581 --> 00:49:36.710
I mean I don't think they had the word engineering.

759
00:49:36.711 --> 00:49:40.670
It wasn't used the way we use it today.
Well,
I guess then just to clarify,

760
00:49:40.671 --> 00:49:43.970
the question would be what would be your advice for those who are pursuing like

761
00:49:44.030 --> 00:49:48.740
comedy or music production arts,
uh,
in a,
in a world where that's,

762
00:49:48.830 --> 00:49:53.330
that's more predominantly focused on math,
science,
engineering,
like you know,

763
00:49:53.540 --> 00:49:53.841
as,

764
00:49:53.841 --> 00:49:58.190
as our government's clearly are winnowing and sifting towards that direction for

765
00:49:58.191 --> 00:50:01.730
people who are in the creative fields.
What would be your advice I guess is my,

766
00:50:02.010 --> 00:50:06.150
is do it,
that's my,
just get started.
That's my advice.

767
00:50:06.530 --> 00:50:09.110
And do you feel like they are just as important as those other fields?

768
00:50:09.170 --> 00:50:11.960
You can't have a world without art.
Okay.

769
00:50:11.961 --> 00:50:14.590
Everybody are improves your life.

770
00:50:16.740 --> 00:50:21.680
We are in this architecture did space that the brings out emotions make you feel

771
00:50:21.681 --> 00:50:26.540
a certain way.
Yes.
You got to have art.
So what's going on?
So,
okay.

772
00:50:27.160 --> 00:50:28.160
All right.
Everything's fine.

773
00:50:30.140 --> 00:50:34.220
I grew up with the space program.
People my age had the space program.

774
00:50:34.221 --> 00:50:38.750
So science was imbued,
was embedded in society.

775
00:50:38.751 --> 00:50:43.220
It was just part of what went on every day along with this crazy optimism that

776
00:50:43.221 --> 00:50:46.010
science scientists and engineers could solve any problem.

777
00:50:46.011 --> 00:50:48.380
We're going to go to the moon.
We're going to do this.

778
00:50:49.070 --> 00:50:52.790
The Apollo program was 4% of the federal budget.

779
00:50:52.820 --> 00:50:55.640
NASA's budget now is 0.4%.

780
00:50:56.330 --> 00:51:00.140
It was literally 10 times as big.
So science was just in,

781
00:51:00.141 --> 00:51:04.910
I was just around all the time.
Cars had fins on them,
like rockets,

782
00:51:05.450 --> 00:51:09.560
not for any utilitarian purpose,
just to remind us all of our cool rockets were.

783
00:51:10.760 --> 00:51:13.970
And uh,
and then so that effort was,

784
00:51:13.971 --> 00:51:17.690
that was really a informal form of warfare.
When that was resolved,

785
00:51:18.170 --> 00:51:22.280
this sorta went away.
So now there's been this emphasis on stem,
stem,
stem,
stem,

786
00:51:22.290 --> 00:51:26.060
science,
technology,
engineering and math,
stem,
stem,
stem,
stem school,
stem wing,

787
00:51:26.061 --> 00:51:31.010
stem teachers.
Stem using video manager and then people quite reasonable.

788
00:51:31.011 --> 00:51:35.960
He said,
well,
what about art?
So now their steam,
right?
Science,
technology,

789
00:51:35.961 --> 00:51:40.370
engineering,
art and math.
Then I've come from time to time.
I meet steam,

790
00:51:41.420 --> 00:51:44.450
science,
technology,
engineering,
art,
math and design.
Okay.

791
00:51:44.480 --> 00:51:46.640
Pretty soon we're going to call it school.

792
00:51:49.700 --> 00:51:51.730
<v 2>It's
just</v>

793
00:51:52.640 --> 00:51:56.030
<v 3>the pendulum's going to swing.
You do not want a world without art,</v>

794
00:51:56.031 --> 00:52:00.170
for crying out loud,
but you do not want a world without science.
So,

795
00:52:00.990 --> 00:52:04.880
all right.
That's what happened.
My interpretation,
which as you know is correct.

796
00:52:06.470 --> 00:52:11.470
Questions in the back,
really his interpreter?
Yes.
Yes.
Bill eyes,
correct?
Yes.

797
00:52:14.180 --> 00:52:18.710
Hello,
Eric,
you're ready to go?
Perfect.
I love Wine Cube,
Mike.

798
00:52:19.730 --> 00:52:24.010
So my question is around engaging climate deniers.
Uh,

799
00:52:24.230 --> 00:52:26.960
in this crowd you are largely preaching to the choir.
Uh,

800
00:52:27.140 --> 00:52:29.630
most of us have friends where we're preaching to the choir.

801
00:52:30.020 --> 00:52:33.800
What can you suggest for us to engage people to make a difference instead of

802
00:52:33.801 --> 00:52:37.430
just talking to people who agree with us?
Well,
so I sell a time,

803
00:52:37.431 --> 00:52:42.431
talk about it and ask people why they don't believe the world's climate is

804
00:52:42.531 --> 00:52:46.160
changing.
And most people you meet really are nervous about it.

805
00:52:46.520 --> 00:52:48.760
That's my experience.
Climate deniers are nervous about it.

806
00:52:49.460 --> 00:52:53.870
I was on the radio this morning in Miami,
Florida,
and there are just,

807
00:52:53.871 --> 00:52:58.010
everybody's talking about it.
The tides are higher every year.
Every full moon,

808
00:52:58.040 --> 00:53:01.670
the tides are higher,
but the called King tides and when the,

809
00:53:02.420 --> 00:53:04.070
when there's a low pressure system,

810
00:53:04.210 --> 00:53:08.570
it shows up in Florida on the sort of the nine o'clock side of a

811
00:53:08.600 --> 00:53:13.580
counterclockwise weather system.
Then the tides are even higher,

812
00:53:13.581 --> 00:53:17.570
you know,
so called a storm surge and they're all talking about it.
Norfolk,

813
00:53:17.571 --> 00:53:20.060
Virginia,
Galveston,
Texas.
They're all talking about it,

814
00:53:20.061 --> 00:53:24.260
so if you keep talking about it,
eventually things will change.

815
00:53:25.080 --> 00:53:30.080
I don't think the u s government will be able to keep most stay in denial.

816
00:53:31.140 --> 00:53:34.200
I just think it all,
they'll run out of steam,
the steam,

817
00:53:34.760 --> 00:53:39.760
the professionals that the environmental protection agency and us geologic

818
00:53:40.291 --> 00:53:43.770
survey and the weather service or just not going to put up with us.

819
00:53:43.771 --> 00:53:44.700
Eventually they'll,

820
00:53:45.720 --> 00:53:48.840
things will turn around just who we want it to be as fast as possible.

821
00:53:52.320 --> 00:53:56.790
Right.
My wishfully thinking.
Yeah,
Scott Pruitt.
Really,

822
00:53:58.200 --> 00:54:02.130
the head of the EPA is the guy who wanted to shut down the EPA.
Really?

823
00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:07.920
Rick Scott,
the governor of Wisconsin won't see the word evolution.

824
00:54:08.600 --> 00:54:12.000
I'm Scott Walker won't say evolution.
Rick Scott,
the governor of Florida,

825
00:54:12.030 --> 00:54:17.030
forbidden tried to forbid anybody from using the phrase climate change in

826
00:54:17.100 --> 00:54:20.090
meetings of legislators.
Oh,
that'll do it.
Yeah.

827
00:54:20.160 --> 00:54:23.660
That's all you gotta do is just not talk about it.
She was,

828
00:54:24.090 --> 00:54:27.900
these are real people running a real country.
It's amazing.

829
00:54:29.060 --> 00:54:30.180
Let's get the cube.

830
00:54:31.830 --> 00:54:36.630
<v 4>Let's take out one or two more questions.
Yes.
Oh,
please.
Yeah,</v>

831
00:54:36.720 --> 00:54:41.250
sorry.
Um,
first of all,
I loved your show as I was growing up as a kid.

832
00:54:41.340 --> 00:54:45.660
I love it.
Thank you,
man.
This is awesome.

833
00:54:45.661 --> 00:54:50.550
I just wanted to know,
uh,
besides science,
if you were involved with the,

834
00:54:50.551 --> 00:54:55.190
uh,
the making of your theme song that so iconic though,
Bill,
Bill,

835
00:54:55.191 --> 00:54:58.280
Bill Bread.
Sorry.

836
00:54:59.520 --> 00:55:03.860
<v 3>I mean,
I did the voice,
uh,
science as a property of matter.
I mean,
I,
yeah,</v>

837
00:55:03.870 --> 00:55:07.470
I did the lip sync.
I mean,
but I was involved.
But the guy did was named uh,

838
00:55:08.070 --> 00:55:11.650
Jim Green and he has a company called 38 fresh.

839
00:55:11.651 --> 00:55:14.610
He was a producer here in Los Angeles.
He's a good guy.

840
00:55:14.690 --> 00:55:17.870
<v 4>Were there any different versions that you had to choose from for the show when</v>

841
00:55:17.871 --> 00:55:18.704
you had

842
00:55:19.340 --> 00:55:21.860
<v 3>it's there?
Were you guys who was 23 years ago?</v>

843
00:55:23.390 --> 00:55:26.270
I don't remember any.
I mean,
if there were different versions,

844
00:55:26.271 --> 00:55:30.560
they might be some scratch tracks that were sort of the same thing that a

845
00:55:30.561 --> 00:55:34.310
different beats per minute,
but it's just no,

846
00:55:36.800 --> 00:55:37.790
and then,
you know,
Tyler,

847
00:55:37.791 --> 00:55:42.410
the Creator did the song for a Bill Nye saves or saved the wound.

848
00:55:42.890 --> 00:55:45.520
He's a good guy that hung out with him one morning and he's,

849
00:55:45.530 --> 00:55:48.440
he's funny guy and a,
we're going to have him on the new show.

850
00:55:48.441 --> 00:55:53.060
We start shooting again on Tuesday.
Yes,
sorry.
12 more shows.

851
00:55:54.470 --> 00:55:58.130
So he tried to make it or he did make a derivative of the old song.

852
00:55:59.270 --> 00:56:03.980
But I don't sing the songs.
Everybody know that.
You hire that out.

853
00:56:06.020 --> 00:56:09.890
The example I give you all,
even if you're a not of an age,

854
00:56:09.980 --> 00:56:13.530
Gilligan's island,
Gilligan doesn't sing the song.

855
00:56:15.050 --> 00:56:17.870
So Bill Nye doesn't sing the song of his own show.

856
00:56:17.871 --> 00:56:22.790
There's one exception by Brian Broadcast History,
Fraser,

857
00:56:23.310 --> 00:56:27.440
uh,
uh,
Kelsey Grammer saying the phrase or song,

858
00:56:27.450 --> 00:56:29.080
not the scrambled eggs.
Yeah,
I know.

859
00:56:31.290 --> 00:56:33.100
Let's do one more question.

860
00:56:33.101 --> 00:56:36.310
I thought was Fraser was a derivative bit from cheers.
Okay.

861
00:56:37.480 --> 00:56:40.060
Jimmy burrows.
Yes.

862
00:56:40.330 --> 00:56:44.800
It's more you need the boom Mike,
the house of blue mix.

863
00:56:44.930 --> 00:56:46.660
<v 4>Yeah.
I guess I have the,</v>

864
00:56:46.661 --> 00:56:51.370
so I just kind of wanted to follow up a little more on the question.
Um,

865
00:56:51.400 --> 00:56:56.400
the gentleman with the beard asked before about essentially like

866
00:56:58.360 --> 00:57:02.350
when you,
I guess like I think it's uncontroversial,
but like you're,

867
00:57:02.351 --> 00:57:06.790
you're not really like a stranger to debates,
debates that are controversial.
Um,

868
00:57:06.850 --> 00:57:09.310
and I guess I find that like,
I don't know,

869
00:57:09.311 --> 00:57:13.590
sometimes I'll argue as people who I sort of like radically disagree with,
um,

870
00:57:13.750 --> 00:57:16.630
and it kind of quickly becomes clear that like,

871
00:57:16.840 --> 00:57:20.910
in no way is it going to be fruitful.
Um,
for example,
you know,
like I,

872
00:57:20.911 --> 00:57:22.240
I know all these people who are like,

873
00:57:22.241 --> 00:57:25.570
right wing populist extremists from like my hometown in Tennessee.

874
00:57:25.840 --> 00:57:28.990
And like you like talk to them about immigration and you're like,
well,

875
00:57:28.991 --> 00:57:31.990
what about the human cost of that ridiculous policy are proposing?

876
00:57:31.991 --> 00:57:32.950
And they're like,
oh yeah.

877
00:57:32.951 --> 00:57:35.800
Well what about the human cost of what Hillary Clinton did it Libya?

878
00:57:36.790 --> 00:57:38.320
And I'm just kinda curious like,

879
00:57:38.740 --> 00:57:42.100
to what extent do you think it's worth like engaging with people with whom you

880
00:57:42.101 --> 00:57:43.210
like radically disagree?

881
00:57:43.510 --> 00:57:46.520
<v 3>Oh,
I think it's worth engaging.
What happens?
You know,</v>

882
00:57:47.300 --> 00:57:51.140
it's wherever the cities are big enough to have people cross paths.

883
00:57:51.740 --> 00:57:55.070
They get over this immigration thing.
Uh,
it's,

884
00:57:55.910 --> 00:57:59.630
I think that'll shake itself out.
Just these are smaller,

885
00:57:59.631 --> 00:58:03.050
like Saint Louis is an interior city.
It's not a coastal city.

886
00:58:03.350 --> 00:58:05.450
Minneapolis is not a coastal city.

887
00:58:06.110 --> 00:58:09.650
But you'll find that the people have lawsuits of the state legislature,

888
00:58:09.651 --> 00:58:14.480
the state attorney generals have lawsuits against this policy because they,

889
00:58:14.481 --> 00:58:18.620
the big cities have diversity and you do business with your neighbors and you

890
00:58:18.621 --> 00:58:21.020
just kind of,
my understanding is you get over it.

891
00:58:21.680 --> 00:58:25.750
So just challenge your friends to travel.
Uh,

892
00:58:26.130 --> 00:58:28.370
you go to New York,
it's a real place.

893
00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:33.020
There are fewer murders per day in New York than any major metropolitan city

894
00:58:33.021 --> 00:58:37.190
because the city kind of freaked out after nine 11.

895
00:58:37.191 --> 00:58:41.540
There's a cop on every corner and you never get lost in New York cause you can

896
00:58:41.541 --> 00:58:46.220
ask directions of all the cops on the corner.
It's fabulous.
Uh,
and uh,

897
00:58:46.280 --> 00:58:50.720
encourage them to go to Paris and see what people are like,
wow.
People eat food.

898
00:58:50.721 --> 00:58:55.280
Cool.
Did Not know that.
And,
uh,
you,

899
00:58:55.460 --> 00:58:58.230
I think it's just we got to get along.

900
00:58:58.231 --> 00:59:03.231
And when you all do at Google is democratize the Internet,

901
00:59:03.590 --> 00:59:08.030
you know,
democratize,
uh,
interactions,
social interactions.
So that's,

902
00:59:08.060 --> 00:59:09.440
it's a long process,

903
00:59:09.830 --> 00:59:14.810
but I encourage you to engage people about anything like that.
And uh,

904
00:59:14.870 --> 00:59:16.910
as far as immigration policies,
it is

905
00:59:19.430 --> 00:59:22.190
okay.
No answer.
Uncles,

906
00:59:22.191 --> 00:59:26.000
no grandparents can really have you thought this through.

907
00:59:26.450 --> 00:59:27.740
So we'll see what happens.

908
00:59:28.130 --> 00:59:33.130
I don't think that policy will last because the court system I think is robust

909
00:59:33.321 --> 00:59:37.610
enough,
but we'll see what happens.
You know,
I tell everybody,

910
00:59:37.611 --> 00:59:39.740
I remember when Nixon resigned,

911
00:59:39.950 --> 00:59:44.950
I'm that old and it took a year and a half for all of that stuff to catch up

912
00:59:45.141 --> 00:59:48.530
with them.
So we'll see what happens in the coming months.

913
00:59:52.280 --> 00:59:55.610
<v 2>Well,
maybe nothing will happen.</v>

914
00:59:57.270 --> 01:00:01.890
<v 3>My idea,
can you talk quite quickly about your,
your um,
national service idea?</v>

915
01:00:01.980 --> 01:00:05.520
Oh yeah.
My national service,
I,
this is great.
So bill,

916
01:00:05.521 --> 01:00:09.780
you chose not to join the military and you've got an opinion.
Yeah,

917
01:00:10.830 --> 01:00:13.200
so people my age,

918
01:00:13.201 --> 01:00:18.201
the reason I did not go to Vietnam was because basically I'm six months too

919
01:00:18.871 --> 01:00:23.740
young.
I missed getting drafted by six months.
I,

920
01:00:23.910 --> 01:00:28.860
I had to register for the draft and your height and weight and everything and

921
01:00:28.861 --> 01:00:31.290
you get ready to be enlisted and stuff.

922
01:00:31.291 --> 01:00:36.291
But then the draft was abolished right before I was born in November.

923
01:00:36.841 --> 01:00:38.430
I went to kindergarten when I was four,

924
01:00:38.431 --> 01:00:43.431
so I didn't turn 18 until my senior year in high school.

925
01:00:44.160 --> 01:00:46.320
So I missed the draft by a few months.

926
01:00:46.321 --> 01:00:51.240
But my older brother's friends were deeply affected by the Vietnam war in a bad

927
01:00:51.241 --> 01:00:55.710
way.
But nevertheless,
because of my parents' experience with the military,

928
01:00:56.460 --> 01:00:58.470
my dad was like many years later,

929
01:00:58.471 --> 01:01:02.730
was declared a veteran because they had served with marines and prison of war

930
01:01:02.731 --> 01:01:04.260
camp.
Uh,

931
01:01:04.950 --> 01:01:09.950
I looked into air force ROTC and I wanted to fly jets.

932
01:01:09.961 --> 01:01:11.220
I thought that would be cool.

933
01:01:11.910 --> 01:01:16.910
I went to get my physical and there were a bunch of pilots sitting there and in

934
01:01:16.980 --> 01:01:19.920
the air force base in Rome,
New York for you,

935
01:01:19.921 --> 01:01:24.630
a rural New York buffs.
And I said,

936
01:01:24.631 --> 01:01:28.650
how often do you guys fly?
Oh,
every six weeks.
Sometimes every two months.

937
01:01:30.190 --> 01:01:33.090
What do you do the rest of the time?
Oh,
we memorize procedures.

938
01:01:33.390 --> 01:01:35.460
Uh Wow.

939
01:01:36.920 --> 01:01:40.800
It doesn't sound like much fun.
So I did not join the military,

940
01:01:42.330 --> 01:01:44.670
but if I had been required to,
I certainly would have.

941
01:01:44.671 --> 01:01:49.671
So my proposal is that we have a national service or akin to the Americorps,

942
01:01:50.580 --> 01:01:54.120
akin to the peace corps,
or everybody had to join.

943
01:01:54.121 --> 01:01:57.630
So in my parent's day,
everybody,
my parents age,

944
01:01:57.631 --> 01:01:59.880
when they would meet at any situation,

945
01:01:59.881 --> 01:02:04.881
waiting in line at the grocery store when they would go out dancing,

946
01:02:05.021 --> 01:02:08.990
when they go out to dinner.
At a restaurant when they'd,
um,
uh,

947
01:02:09.030 --> 01:02:10.170
pick up kids at school.

948
01:02:10.171 --> 01:02:14.010
What they all talked about was what they did during the War World War II because

949
01:02:14.011 --> 01:02:18.210
this thing was such a big deal.
It bound everybody together,

950
01:02:18.420 --> 01:02:23.160
people of faiths,
of all a ancestry.
We're all in this thing together.

951
01:02:23.161 --> 01:02:28.161
So my proposal is that we have a national service that you have to complete

952
01:02:28.681 --> 01:02:33.610
before you turn 26.
And then we would all be involved in the,

953
01:02:33.611 --> 01:02:36.900
if you join the military,
that would count of course for your national service.

954
01:02:37.320 --> 01:02:40.860
It would be involved here domestically or maybe overseas,

955
01:02:40.861 --> 01:02:45.120
all in this thing together.
And yes,
yes,
crazy uncle bill.

956
01:02:45.121 --> 01:02:49.360
It would have to be paid for it tax dollars.
Ah,
ah,

957
01:02:50.050 --> 01:02:52.480
but we would get infrastructure built,

958
01:02:52.481 --> 01:02:55.810
we would get schools connected to the Internet for example,

959
01:02:56.440 --> 01:02:58.300
and everybody would be required to do it.

960
01:02:58.301 --> 01:03:00.700
And we'd all take it for granted that we had to do it.

961
01:03:00.820 --> 01:03:05.820
And I think it would bind us together and ultimately save money.

962
01:03:06.521 --> 01:03:08.950
And we wouldn't have this red state,
blue state,

963
01:03:09.220 --> 01:03:13.690
horrible division that we're nurturing or,
uh,
or end up with right now.

964
01:03:14.110 --> 01:03:17.380
And it's a crazy idea,
but the idea is you could,
if you wanted to,

965
01:03:18.190 --> 01:03:22.540
you could finish college undergraduate before you did your national service.

966
01:03:23.080 --> 01:03:27.520
If you like.
My Dad didn't think law school,
it sounded like all that much fun.

967
01:03:27.970 --> 01:03:30.040
You would do your national service right after that.

968
01:03:30.041 --> 01:03:32.740
If you are obsessed and crazy,
like a few of you are crazy,

969
01:03:32.870 --> 01:03:37.870
just very interested in your academic success and you wanted to get your phd,

970
01:03:39.460 --> 01:03:42.670
you would take your national service after you got your master's degree,

971
01:03:42.671 --> 01:03:47.140
before you went back for your phd.
That's my proposal bill.
That'll never fly.

972
01:03:47.141 --> 01:03:50.260
Everybody hates each other.
We don't want to spend any more tax dollars.
I know.

973
01:03:50.260 --> 01:03:51.093
Okay,

974
01:03:51.160 --> 01:03:55.930
so what if each state had a state service in California?

975
01:03:55.931 --> 01:03:59.710
State service would kind of put pressure on Nevada to have a Nevada state

976
01:03:59.711 --> 01:04:01.690
service and an Arizona state service.

977
01:04:01.930 --> 01:04:06.340
Oregon would sure as heck put pressure on Washington devastate service and then

978
01:04:06.341 --> 01:04:09.820
maybe this could become a national service.
It's a proposal.

979
01:04:10.990 --> 01:04:13.930
It's a little crazy.
I'm glad you asked about it,

980
01:04:14.710 --> 01:04:18.280
but the idea is that we'd all have a common purpose so we wouldn't have,

981
01:04:18.310 --> 01:04:18.581
you know,

982
01:04:18.581 --> 01:04:23.581
there was 15 minutes after nine 11 where everybody was raw,

983
01:04:23.591 --> 01:04:28.480
raw us in a constructive way,
uh,
as horrible as that was.

984
01:04:28.990 --> 01:04:33.100
And so the national services,
just one of my cookie little ideas.
Great.

985
01:04:33.340 --> 01:04:36.490
That's great.
It could be.
We're going to wrap with,
um,

986
01:04:36.491 --> 01:04:39.040
some quick rapid fire question.
Oh yes.
Lightening Round.

987
01:04:39.830 --> 01:04:44.500
Naming your favorite teacher.
Uh,
Mr. Lang.

988
01:04:44.501 --> 01:04:47.890
Physics 11th grade.
Uh,
they don't get me,
I mean,

989
01:04:47.891 --> 01:04:51.680
not that I didn't like Mr. Morrison and this rush.
Okay.
One of your feet.
Yeah.

990
01:04:51.681 --> 01:04:55.240
Yeah,
Mr. Lawrence and sixth grade freaking changed my life.

991
01:04:56.200 --> 01:05:00.730
One of your favorite characters from fiction.
Look,
slow.
Captain Kirk,

992
01:05:00.880 --> 01:05:05.850
Captain Kirk,
Captain Kirk.
You can be an animal for a day.
Well,

993
01:05:06.030 --> 01:05:06.880
I am an animal,

994
01:05:09.950 --> 01:05:14.120
you know,
successful Pelican or something.

995
01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.920
Don't want to get eaten.
Know you want to be the tour.

996
01:05:20.390 --> 01:05:23.320
You've worked with a lot of great educational youtube burrs.

997
01:05:24.010 --> 01:05:27.010
One one that you really enjoyed working with.

998
01:05:28.300 --> 01:05:32.770
Physics Girl Diane.
Oh yeah,
she's great.
Great [inaudible] calendar alleys.
Great.

999
01:05:32.771 --> 01:05:37.390
And Derek Mauer ver very tazia.
He's really great.

1000
01:05:37.540 --> 01:05:41.470
He's a good guy.
Fantastic self driving car or human powered bike.

1001
01:05:42.940 --> 01:05:46.150
Well human powered bike.
If the distances are suitable,

1002
01:05:47.310 --> 01:05:51.250
I mean it's self driving car.
If I live in studio city,

1003
01:05:51.251 --> 01:05:55.930
it's 2123 miles to get here.
I mean,
yeah,
you could do it,

1004
01:05:56.020 --> 01:05:58.090
but then I got to go to San Diego this afternoon.

1005
01:05:58.880 --> 01:06:01.240
You have to be a heck of an athlete.
I'm sure I could do it.

1006
01:06:02.800 --> 01:06:04.360
And the self driving car,
you guys,

1007
01:06:04.420 --> 01:06:09.420
I think about my grandfather went into world war one on a horse.

1008
01:06:11.290 --> 01:06:15.280
Nobody went into World War Two on a horse.
Nobody was serious about it.

1009
01:06:15.520 --> 01:06:16.930
I mean it would want,
wanted to live through it.

1010
01:06:16.960 --> 01:06:20.590
So everything changed in 25 years.

1011
01:06:20.710 --> 01:06:25.480
Everything changed.
So why you don't I learn,
I can drive a stick shift.

1012
01:06:25.810 --> 01:06:29.640
Great.
That end four bucks will get you the Latte,
you know what I mean?

1013
01:06:29.650 --> 01:06:33.310
It's just a skill you don't need anymore.
And then the last one for the win,

1014
01:06:33.550 --> 01:06:35.620
potential energy or kinetic energy.

1015
01:06:40.510 --> 01:06:41.000
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1016
01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.430
<v 3>There.
You know,
you exchange one for the other.</v>

1017
01:06:44.330 --> 01:06:49.100
I want to be in motion if you can.
There we met up.
Let's all give it up.

1018
01:06:49.270 --> 01:06:51.610
<v 2>Bill Nye.
Thank you so much.</v>

1019
01:06:51.750 --> 01:06:55.300
[inaudible] somebody can hold up the book.

1020
01:06:55.510 --> 01:06:58.360
Let's get a close up of the book.
You got to check out the book.

1021
01:06:58.361 --> 01:06:59.194
Please buy the book.

1022
01:06:59.580 --> 01:07:01.320
