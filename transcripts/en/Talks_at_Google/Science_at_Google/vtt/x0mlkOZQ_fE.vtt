00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:09.550
Hello everyone.
This was pleasure.
I introduce Dr. Lawrence Krauss.

2
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.750
Dr Crosses the foundation professor of the school of Earth and space exploration

3
00:00:13.751 --> 00:00:15.310
at Arizona State University.

4
00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:19.420
He has made significant contributions in cosmology where he was one of the first

5
00:00:19.421 --> 00:00:21.850
physicists to suggest the existence of dark energy,

6
00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:24.790
a substance which may be responsible for 63 sorry,

7
00:00:24.791 --> 00:00:29.290
68.3% of all the total energy in the observable universe.

8
00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:33.670
Dr Krauss is also a tireless advocate for public understanding of science.

9
00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:37.510
He served on the Science Policy Committee for Barack Obama's 2008 presidential

10
00:00:37.511 --> 00:00:39.940
campaign,
contributed articles to the Atlantic,

11
00:00:39.941 --> 00:00:43.570
The New Yorker and Newsweek and written several New York Times bestselling books

12
00:00:43.571 --> 00:00:45.550
on science including his previous book,

13
00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:47.920
the well noted and well regarded universe from nothing.

14
00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:51.880
My first exposure to Dr crosses were came with one of his early books,

15
00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:54.580
the physics of Star Trek,
which I found enthralling for.

16
00:00:54.581 --> 00:00:57.250
It's thorough and altogether serious.
Look at the physics,

17
00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:01.060
plausible and otherwise of one of my favorite series.
It was a brief aside,

18
00:01:01.061 --> 00:01:04.120
Dr Krauss.
I feel like there was a a missed opportunity.

19
00:01:04.121 --> 00:01:07.210
You wrote a followup called beyond star trek and I feel it should have been

20
00:01:07.211 --> 00:01:09.970
named the physics of Star Trek two,
the wrath of crowds.

21
00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.490
You taking that out of my,
I put that in my appendix.
Oh,
you did.
Oh,
you did.
Now,

22
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.780
uh,
today Dr Krauss is here to talk about his latest book,

23
00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:21.820
documenting our current understanding of nature,

24
00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.670
the history of one of humanities,
greatest scientific achievements,

25
00:01:24.671 --> 00:01:28.630
the standard model of particle physics and its implications for our existence

26
00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.020
and what promises to be the greatest story ever told so far.

27
00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:33.940
Join me in giving a warm welcome to Dr [inaudible].

28
00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:39.260
<v 1>[inaudible].</v>

29
00:01:41.351 --> 00:01:41.520
Thanks.

30
00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.470
<v 0>Well,
it's a pleasure to be here and</v>

31
00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.440
see all of you and I,
I'm understand it's lunchtime,
so I shouldn't go over time.

32
00:01:49.441 --> 00:01:52.290
So I'll make a shorter version than normal because I know you have really

33
00:01:52.291 --> 00:01:55.810
important work to do.
So,
um,
in any case,
uh,
the,

34
00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:00.020
the quote that I had here along with the music,
um,
comes from,
uh,
uh,

35
00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:03.870
a book that actually a friend friend of mine who is a filmmaker named Werner

36
00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:08.850
Herzog,
recommended to me.
And,
um,
and,
uh,
and he,
you know,
you've met,

37
00:02:08.851 --> 00:02:11.070
he's seen his most recent,
well not most recent,

38
00:02:11.071 --> 00:02:14.520
really big second most recent movie.
Lo and behold,
which is about the Internet,

39
00:02:14.521 --> 00:02:17.320
which is nice when there's another one that just came out,
um,

40
00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.860
which is a fiction called salt and fire that I'm also in as a,
as a villain,
but,

41
00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:27.030
uh,
it's a weirder movie.
But anyway,
this,
this,
um,
the move,
this book,

42
00:02:27.031 --> 00:02:30.570
which is called the peregrine,
is about a peregrine.
And,
um,

43
00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.240
but it is a wonderful naturalist book if you ever want to read it.

44
00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:34.980
But the quote is what's particular important,

45
00:02:34.981 --> 00:02:37.290
which is the hardest thing of all to see is what is really there.

46
00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:41.550
And that's really the,
the thrust of,
of,
uh,

47
00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:46.410
of the content of my book,
which is that the,
the world we live in is an illusion.

48
00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.660
And,
uh,
it's an,
uh,
been amazing story for particle physics and,
and,
and,
oh,

49
00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:56.130
look at that.
Okay.
Is there a reason that went off auto power,

50
00:02:56.131 --> 00:02:59.380
off engaged power,
auto power off was engaged.

51
00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.580
So waiting for projectors to start.
Good.

52
00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.070
Very impressed with the technology.
Um,
the,
uh,

53
00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:11.770
so anyway,
uh,

54
00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.980
the standard model of particle physics and in fact Parco physics in general has

55
00:03:14.981 --> 00:03:17.360
been about trying to understand the,
uh,

56
00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.990
the fundamental structure of matter and energy.

57
00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:24.250
And it is really an amazing story of how different the universe is,

58
00:03:24.251 --> 00:03:26.800
that fundamental skills in the skill we see.

59
00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:30.840
And one of the real implications.

60
00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:34.030
And then one of the reasons the subtitle of the book is called why are we here,

61
00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:39.450
is that the universe that we exist in is an accident in a world defined way,

62
00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:44.230
which I will,
we'll,
I'll talk about until until the,
uh,

63
00:03:44.231 --> 00:03:48.130
until the projector gets,
gets to there.
I'll get,
I'll be,
oh,
that,

64
00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:51.280
let me just get to the slide I want to do.
So when we get,

65
00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:56.130
when the projector actually turns on,
which is certainly not now,
um,
oh,

66
00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:00.430
oh,
the light just came on.
That's good.
Uh,
we can get to the image I want to show,

67
00:04:00.431 --> 00:04:05.260
which is of a,
of a window in the wintertime with ice crystals on it.

68
00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:08.380
I was actually just in Phoenix where I teach and I show,

69
00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:11.830
I gave a lecture on this and I had to explain to people those were ice crystals.

70
00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:15.430
But,
uh,
here we go.
Um,
and so these are beautiful,

71
00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:18.820
but what I want you to do is think for a second of what it would be like if you

72
00:04:18.821 --> 00:04:23.390
lived on one of them.
Uh,
so I'd say this one.
Okay.
If you evolved on,
on,

73
00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:28.360
and we can still use that word in the u s um,
uh,
if you evolved on that crystal,

74
00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:32.170
uh,
what would,
what would happen while the physicists,

75
00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:36.250
I don't know where it is in that one anyway.
It's,
let's say with this one.
Oh No,

76
00:04:36.251 --> 00:04:37.510
there it is.
Um,

77
00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:41.770
the physicists working in this world would say,
well,
okay,

78
00:04:41.771 --> 00:04:42.880
I can work out the forces.

79
00:04:42.881 --> 00:04:46.480
The forces along the spine of the crystal are very different than the forces

80
00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:48.550
perpendicular.
So they'd come up with laws of physics,

81
00:04:48.551 --> 00:04:51.460
which would explain and predict how things moved,

82
00:04:51.461 --> 00:04:54.880
and they'd be one set of forces in this direction and will forces in the other

83
00:04:54.881 --> 00:04:58.150
direction.
And that would seem natural.
There'd be theologians who'd say,
well,

84
00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:03.180
explain why God ordained that direction to be the proper direction for life.

85
00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:04.781
And there'd be,

86
00:05:04.781 --> 00:05:07.960
and there'd be wars fought over whether that was the right direction or that was

87
00:05:07.961 --> 00:05:11.800
the right direction to pray to.
And um,
uh,

88
00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:15.910
all of that would have significance,
which of course is completely illusory,

89
00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:20.800
that it is just an accident and crystal can point in any given direction.

90
00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:25.030
And uh,
but it wouldn't seem that way if you lived on that crystal.

91
00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:27.880
And that's essentially the world we live in.

92
00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:31.480
All of the facets of the world that looked like make it look like the universe

93
00:05:31.481 --> 00:05:35.920
is designed for our existence,
our pure accidents in a fundamental way,

94
00:05:35.921 --> 00:05:39.550
which I'll try and describe.
And,
uh,
and we,

95
00:05:39.551 --> 00:05:43.600
of course the world looks like it's designed for us,
but at a fundamental level,

96
00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:47.200
it's actually antithetical to our existence.
As I'll describe to you now,

97
00:05:47.201 --> 00:05:48.610
the story is long and winding.

98
00:05:48.611 --> 00:05:51.640
And obviously I said I want to give an abridged version so you can get back to

99
00:05:51.641 --> 00:05:56.290
work.
But,
um,
so I want,
I'll start fairly late into this.
Uh,

100
00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:00.210
but the story actually begins 2000 years ago with Plato and then works work

101
00:06:00.211 --> 00:06:04.280
through Maxwell and Einstein talking about the major revolutions that have

102
00:06:04.281 --> 00:06:08.120
changed our pers perspective of our place in the universe.

103
00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:13.040
And one of the things that describes pretty well the progress of science

104
00:06:13.041 --> 00:06:17.130
certainly in physics in any case,
is when we know made,

105
00:06:17.131 --> 00:06:21.770
made progress when two things that seem very different on the surface are seem

106
00:06:21.771 --> 00:06:23.330
to be different reflections of the same thing.

107
00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:26.940
And then we know we've made progress and that pretty well characterized as

108
00:06:26.941 --> 00:06:30.350
almost all the progress in physics over the ages from,
for example,

109
00:06:30.351 --> 00:06:33.050
in recent times the recognition that electricity and magnetism,

110
00:06:33.051 --> 00:06:35.750
which seems so different are really exactly the same thing.

111
00:06:35.751 --> 00:06:38.690
And one person's electricity is another person's magnetism.

112
00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:41.120
That led to the realization that space and time,

113
00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:44.600
which seemed different are really the same thing and what one person sees a

114
00:06:44.601 --> 00:06:46.460
space and other personal measure as time.

115
00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:49.100
We live in a four dimensional university,
not a three dimensional universe.

116
00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:53.510
And those kind of developments of progressively told us that the university we

117
00:06:53.511 --> 00:06:58.250
see is kind of my opening because we perceive these three dimensional slices of

118
00:06:58.251 --> 00:06:59.540
a four dimensional universe,

119
00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:02.690
which is why it seems so not intuitive to us that the universe is four

120
00:07:02.691 --> 00:07:05.000
dimensional.
And when I'm running with respect to you,

121
00:07:05.001 --> 00:07:07.790
I'm seeing a different three dimensional slice of a four dimensional universe,

122
00:07:07.791 --> 00:07:11.530
which is why things seem strange and relativity does what it does since.

123
00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:13.640
And I talk about those things at great length in the book.

124
00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:17.360
So though up after that point we had,

125
00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:19.730
we developed a theory of electromagnetism and a theory of,

126
00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:24.860
of gravity and all seemed well until we got to a later stage.

127
00:07:24.861 --> 00:07:27.590
And I want to begin the later stage with this guy who all of,
you know,

128
00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:30.830
I assume it's Richard Fineman and uh,

129
00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:34.470
who was probably what,

130
00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:37.640
what was one of the greatest physicists of the second half of the 20th century.

131
00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:39.800
And uh,

132
00:07:40.310 --> 00:07:44.330
what he won the Nobel prize for him with others was the recognition that of

133
00:07:44.331 --> 00:07:47.180
course,
at the fundamental level,
the world is quantum mechanical.

134
00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:50.000
And if we want to have a theory of electromagnetism,

135
00:07:50.001 --> 00:07:52.520
we need to put in a quarter of the quantum mechanics.

136
00:07:52.521 --> 00:07:55.760
And the theory they develop called Quantum electrodynamics is a theory that

137
00:07:55.761 --> 00:07:57.770
merges electromagnetism and quantum mechanics.

138
00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:02.540
And he presented a way of,
of thinking about this,

139
00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:05.660
to understand the electric force between two charges,

140
00:08:05.661 --> 00:08:09.830
which had been understood by Faraday and Maxwell in a slightly different way.

141
00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.100
A way we,
we talk a by five and diagrams as we call them,

142
00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:16.520
but it's particularly interesting.

143
00:08:16.521 --> 00:08:20.660
So this is an electron and it repels another electron and it does.
So

144
00:08:22.550 --> 00:08:24.650
by the exchange of a particle,
a Photon,

145
00:08:24.651 --> 00:08:27.950
the quantum of the electromagnetic field of electromagnetic waves come and

146
00:08:27.951 --> 00:08:31.670
particles and photons are the individual Quanta.
Now,

147
00:08:32.570 --> 00:08:36.620
what Fiman used in developing this is a key aspect of quantum mechanics,

148
00:08:37.370 --> 00:08:38.960
which is central to quantum mechanics,

149
00:08:38.961 --> 00:08:43.961
which is really the same thing that's used in Washington and corporate America,

150
00:08:44.390 --> 00:08:47.360
which are now the same thing.
If,

151
00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:52.550
if you can't see it,
anything goes,
okay,
that's basically it.

152
00:08:52.551 --> 00:08:55.070
And we'll learn more about that with investigations over the next.

153
00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:57.450
I certainly hope,
but uh,

154
00:08:58.770 --> 00:09:03.690
but so the idea is that this electron emits this particle,
this photon of light.

155
00:09:03.691 --> 00:09:06.270
But that's impossible.
It's not allowed.

156
00:09:06.930 --> 00:09:08.760
The electronic just sitting there cannot admit it.

157
00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:11.550
Admit a particle of light because where did the energy come from?

158
00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:14.340
If the photon carries energy,
where did the energy come from?

159
00:09:14.341 --> 00:09:16.860
The electronics still there.
If it's an isolated electron,

160
00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:21.750
it can't emit a photon cause that doesn't conserve energy,
but that's okay.

161
00:09:21.751 --> 00:09:24.900
That's allowed by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle,

162
00:09:24.901 --> 00:09:28.890
which is responsible for that Washington rule I gave you the Heisenberg

163
00:09:28.891 --> 00:09:32.340
uncertainty principle says if I measure a system for a short time,

164
00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:36.840
then I can't know it's energy.
Exactly.
There's some uncertainty in the energy.

165
00:09:37.350 --> 00:09:41.790
So if I admit this photon and it violates energy conservation,

166
00:09:41.791 --> 00:09:43.520
that's allowed in,
in,
in quantum mechanics,

167
00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:47.550
as long as the photon disappears in such a short time that I can't measure it,

168
00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:51.690
it's just exactly like embezzlement.
Okay.
I'm,

169
00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:56.160
I'm sure Google does this every day is some level because if you get the money

170
00:09:56.161 --> 00:09:59.550
and as long as you put it back before anyone notices,
it's free.

171
00:09:59.550 --> 00:10:02.120
You can do whatever you want with it.
Right?
And that's that.
You know,

172
00:10:02.130 --> 00:10:05.700
there's a lot of trading that goes into,
in that regard.
So it's exactly the same.

173
00:10:05.701 --> 00:10:08.760
So the photon can take,
it can violate energy conservation here,

174
00:10:08.761 --> 00:10:11.640
as long as it disappears before you can measure it,
you're fine.

175
00:10:11.641 --> 00:10:14.100
And so the photon is exchange and it produces that repulsion.

176
00:10:14.370 --> 00:10:17.160
Now the key point is the photon has zero mass.

177
00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:19.920
It's massless and that's essential to the,

178
00:10:21.610 --> 00:10:23.880
to make electromagnetism along range force.

179
00:10:24.110 --> 00:10:27.450
An Electron here repels an electron and Alpha Centaury okay.

180
00:10:27.630 --> 00:10:32.160
Or anywhere in another galaxy.
And the reason is because the photon is massless.

181
00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:37.200
It can carry an arbitrarily small amount of energy and if it can carry an

182
00:10:37.201 --> 00:10:41.010
arbitrarily small amount of energy that it can exist for an arbitrarily long

183
00:10:41.011 --> 00:10:44.610
time before it has to disappear without violating the Heisenberg uncertainty

184
00:10:44.611 --> 00:10:47.190
principle.
And if it can exist for an arbitrary long time,

185
00:10:47.191 --> 00:10:50.460
it can travel from here to Alpha centaury before it's absorbed.

186
00:10:51.060 --> 00:10:55.260
So the fact that electromagnetism is a long range force is uniquely,

187
00:10:55.590 --> 00:10:59.670
uh,
related to the fact that the photon is massless in this picture.
Okay.

188
00:10:59.730 --> 00:11:01.620
And this photon because you can't see it.

189
00:11:01.621 --> 00:11:05.630
It's called the virtual photon cause it doesn't really exist.
It just it,

190
00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:10.410
you can't ever measure it.
If you look forward,
it's not there.
Okay.
And Ah,
great.

191
00:11:10.411 --> 00:11:11.340
And so this picture,

192
00:11:11.341 --> 00:11:14.520
this is a complete picture of the quantum theory of electromagnetism.

193
00:11:14.730 --> 00:11:19.140
You absorb an emit these virtual photons that can do anything they want as long

194
00:11:19.141 --> 00:11:23.700
as you can't see them.
And this theory is the best theory and science.

195
00:11:24.180 --> 00:11:27.930
It's the best area in any area of science.
So you can,
based on this theory,

196
00:11:27.931 --> 00:11:32.460
you can make predictions and compare them with observations to 14 decimal
places,

197
00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:35.790
which you can't do in any other areas of science where fundamental predictions

198
00:11:35.791 --> 00:11:38.850
compared to observations.
So this is as good as it gets in science.

199
00:11:39.090 --> 00:11:42.450
And in the 1940s when this was developed,
this was great.

200
00:11:42.451 --> 00:11:45.660
We now have a complete theory called quantum electrodynamics,
which,

201
00:11:45.990 --> 00:11:49.890
which explains and predicts perfectly every measurement you can make an Adams

202
00:11:49.891 --> 00:11:54.490
and other things where electric fields are.
So that's great.

203
00:11:54.850 --> 00:11:59.530
Okay.
And now,
and that look great for nature,
but then nature intervened.
Okay.

204
00:11:59.770 --> 00:12:02.830
Nature v intervened with by the fact that the neutron is radioactive.

205
00:12:02.831 --> 00:12:06.670
Now this should disturb you.
Okay?
Because,
uh,

206
00:12:06.820 --> 00:12:09.010
I remember I first learned about it when I was in high school from a guy named

207
00:12:09.011 --> 00:12:12.430
Tommy gold who was a wonderful astronomer.
But,
but,
uh,

208
00:12:13.570 --> 00:12:16.600
you should disturb you because most of the particles in your body are neutrons,

209
00:12:16.870 --> 00:12:20.690
neutrons,
and protons,
makeup atomic nuclei.
And for heavy nuclei,

210
00:12:20.691 --> 00:12:23.530
I certainly there an average more neutrons in there,
our protons.

211
00:12:23.770 --> 00:12:27.820
So the number one dominant particle in your body is a neutron.
Okay?

212
00:12:28.270 --> 00:12:32.410
If I take a neutron here and hold it up,
it will decay in 10 minutes.

213
00:12:33.310 --> 00:12:33.970
Okay?

214
00:12:33.970 --> 00:12:37.420
And you will notice maybe to your chagrin that you've been here for more than 10

215
00:12:37.421 --> 00:12:38.680
minutes and they're still here.

216
00:12:39.050 --> 00:12:42.400
You maybe pray praying for your neutrons to decay,

217
00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:47.770
but,
but they're not.
And why is that an accident of our existence?

218
00:12:47.771 --> 00:12:49.670
So how does new,
what's neutron decay?

219
00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:53.170
While a neutron decays into three particles,
the proton,

220
00:12:53.410 --> 00:12:57.180
that's just a fancier of writing electron,
a proton electron in a Neutrino,

221
00:12:57.230 --> 00:13:01.720
another particle.
The key point,
however,
is that the neutron and Proton way,

222
00:13:01.721 --> 00:13:06.250
almost exactly the same amount,
the difference between these two masses is,

223
00:13:06.430 --> 00:13:08.080
is one part in a thousand.

224
00:13:09.610 --> 00:13:12.220
And so the neutron is barely enough energy to decay.
K if it,

225
00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:16.600
if it's mass was less than the sum of these three masses,
it couldn't decay.

226
00:13:16.930 --> 00:13:18.640
Again,
it would violate energy conservation.

227
00:13:18.790 --> 00:13:21.370
So it's just barely more than the mass of these three particles,

228
00:13:21.490 --> 00:13:25.690
which is why it lasts a long because 10 minutes is a hell of a long time in

229
00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:30.250
particle physics units.
Okay.
I mean,
so it's,
so it seems like an eternity.

230
00:13:30.251 --> 00:13:33.730
So this is a very long lived particle,
but short lived by our standards.

231
00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:38.420
So how come you're still here,
which you may be asking yourself?
Um,

232
00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:42.900
uh,
so the,
it's an accident.
Okay.
What happens when I drop?

233
00:13:42.910 --> 00:13:46.000
Put a new neutron in the nucleus?
Well,

234
00:13:46.001 --> 00:13:49.630
it falls the nucleus and it gets bound.
What does it mean to be bound?
Well,

235
00:13:49.750 --> 00:13:53.740
some of you know,
but otherwise it means that you,
it takes energy to get out.

236
00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:58.210
You lose energy when you get bound.
And so the new tread falls,

237
00:13:58.211 --> 00:14:01.030
the nucleus loses energy but equals MC squared.

238
00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:05.890
So the neutron gets lighter and when the neutrons gets in a nucleus,

239
00:14:05.891 --> 00:14:09.790
it's no longer has its mass is too small to decay into these particles.

240
00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:14.470
So the neutrons are only stable in new glide by that accident.

241
00:14:14.471 --> 00:14:19.000
That the fact that the new Trump proton mass difference is so small that when it

242
00:14:19.001 --> 00:14:22.180
falls into a nucleus,
it no longer has enough energy to,

243
00:14:22.690 --> 00:14:26.170
to a decay and that's why you're here.
That's why they're heavy elements.

244
00:14:26.171 --> 00:14:30.550
If it weren't for that carbon,
nitrogen,
oxygen and all the things that,
that uh,

245
00:14:30.551 --> 00:14:34.780
on which our lives are based would not exist just because of that fortuitous

246
00:14:34.781 --> 00:14:38.650
fact that these particles have almost the same mess.
Okay.
That's interesting.

247
00:14:38.950 --> 00:14:40.960
But more interesting for physicists was,

248
00:14:41.290 --> 00:14:44.680
well this was a little disconcerting because suddenly this implied there was a

249
00:14:44.681 --> 00:14:47.770
new force in nature.
The neutron was discovered in 1932.
Okay.

250
00:14:48.610 --> 00:14:53.540
Suddenly a new force had to because electromagnetism can't cause this decay and

251
00:14:53.541 --> 00:14:55.070
gravity can't cause us to case.

252
00:14:55.071 --> 00:14:58.520
So there had to be some new force in nature that would cause that to gay.

253
00:14:58.520 --> 00:15:01.580
And of course the question is what kind of forces says is it and how we can,

254
00:15:01.610 --> 00:15:05.240
can we understand it?
The first person to write down a theory for that,

255
00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:08.510
any kind of theory was one of my favorite physicist from the 20th century,

256
00:15:08.511 --> 00:15:09.344
Enrico Fermi,

257
00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:14.860
who was the last particle slash nuclear physicist who was equally good at,

258
00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:16.280
at,
at theory and experiment.

259
00:15:16.490 --> 00:15:21.380
The two fields have become sufficiently complicated that you can't do both now.

260
00:15:21.530 --> 00:15:25.100
Okay.
He was the last one who was able to do both really well.
He was very,
uh,

261
00:15:25.101 --> 00:15:29.930
he also historically in the Manhattan project was the one who was assigned the

262
00:15:29.931 --> 00:15:34.010
task of building the first nuclear reactor,
the first sustained chain reaction.

263
00:15:34.370 --> 00:15:37.670
And so he built it,
they built it in the University of Chicago,
um,

264
00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:39.020
underneath the football field,

265
00:15:39.530 --> 00:15:42.680
which I've always viewed as an inspired choice because if anything went wrong,

266
00:15:42.681 --> 00:15:47.570
you just killed football players and there's no loss.
And,
and um,
so fair me,

267
00:15:47.820 --> 00:15:49.360
uh,
built that successfully.

268
00:15:49.370 --> 00:15:52.940
But he also wrote down this first model this and he submitted it to the journal

269
00:15:52.941 --> 00:15:54.740
Nature and got rejected,

270
00:15:55.220 --> 00:15:59.910
which hardens many of us who submit to nature and get rejected.
Um,

271
00:16:00.380 --> 00:16:04.400
and uh,
but he didn't take it well and he,
uh,
in fact,
he said,

272
00:16:04.401 --> 00:16:07.550
I'm not going to do theory.
Now I'm going to just go do experiments,

273
00:16:07.790 --> 00:16:08.750
which was good for him.

274
00:16:08.751 --> 00:16:11.540
It turned out because the next experiment he did won him the Nobel Prize in

275
00:16:11.541 --> 00:16:14.060
physics.
So worked for him.
But uh,

276
00:16:14.061 --> 00:16:18.500
but as his theory was built upon a by others,

277
00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:20.720
now the really important thing,

278
00:16:20.721 --> 00:16:23.750
there are many important aspects of science that I want to try and emphasize and

279
00:16:23.751 --> 00:16:25.940
I try and emphasize in the book because they have relevance.

280
00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:28.100
Well beyond the esoteric physics,

281
00:16:28.101 --> 00:16:31.890
I'm talking about relevance as I'll describe in some sense to the quagmire where

282
00:16:31.891 --> 00:16:33.350
I find ourselves living in right now.

283
00:16:34.370 --> 00:16:37.460
But the one thing that's really important about science is that it's like

284
00:16:37.461 --> 00:16:42.230
Hollywood and maybe like Google actually probably in that regard,
if it works,

285
00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:46.850
copy it.
Okay.
And keep copying it until it doesn't work anymore.

286
00:16:46.851 --> 00:16:47.690
It's like Halloween,

287
00:16:47.691 --> 00:16:50.870
56 or whatever it's going to is as long as you can sell tickets,

288
00:16:50.900 --> 00:16:54.950
keep propping it.
And so if we have a theory that works,
copy it.

289
00:16:54.951 --> 00:16:59.720
So here's the best theory in nature.
So the idea was if you have a new,

290
00:16:59.750 --> 00:17:01.990
if you have a new forest,
let's make it look like this for us.

291
00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.200
So we could draw a picture.
If [inaudible] argument,

292
00:17:04.230 --> 00:17:08.660
it looks the same sort of a neutron to of proteins made of quarks,

293
00:17:08.661 --> 00:17:11.420
but that's a little look added.
Complication doesn't really matter.

294
00:17:11.630 --> 00:17:13.580
And then an electron neutrino come out.

295
00:17:13.850 --> 00:17:16.280
And if this works by the exchange of particle,
then why not?

296
00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:18.590
Imagine this force works by the exchange of a particle,

297
00:17:18.830 --> 00:17:20.810
but this force is very different than this force.

298
00:17:21.860 --> 00:17:25.460
This forks works across the universe.
This force,

299
00:17:25.461 --> 00:17:27.860
the weak force operates only on the scale of nuclei.

300
00:17:28.620 --> 00:17:30.390
That's why we don't see it on human scales.

301
00:17:30.470 --> 00:17:33.860
It's only works for on the scale of nuclear.
So it's very short range.

302
00:17:33.861 --> 00:17:36.320
This is very long range.
So weak,
this is strong.

303
00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:39.980
How can you relate those two things?
Well,

304
00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:42.800
if you make this particle massive,

305
00:17:43.730 --> 00:17:46.040
then what happens if this is very,
very massive,

306
00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:50.840
then it always carried then emitting it always produces a lot of energy because

307
00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.070
equals MC squared.
So if it's massive,

308
00:17:53.220 --> 00:17:56.790
you can't help but have a lot of energy produced here and that means you violate

309
00:17:56.791 --> 00:17:58.920
energy conservation by huge amount,

310
00:17:58.980 --> 00:18:03.300
which means the particle has to disappear very quickly by the Heisenberg

311
00:18:03.301 --> 00:18:07.260
uncertainty principle because otherwise that huge amount of energy and be

312
00:18:07.261 --> 00:18:11.430
noticed.
So if you emit a particle that's very,
very massive,

313
00:18:11.490 --> 00:18:15.990
it can travel only a very short time and therefore only a very short distance

314
00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:19.320
before it has to disappear.
I like the masters case.

315
00:18:19.321 --> 00:18:21.080
So you want a short range force,

316
00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:24.900
just exchange of massive particle Longreach ports,
a mass as particle,

317
00:18:24.901 --> 00:18:25.740
everything works fine,

318
00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:31.170
but it doesn't because this theory gives the best predictions in nature.

319
00:18:31.650 --> 00:18:34.950
This theory gives nonsense because when you do the mathematics,

320
00:18:34.951 --> 00:18:35.910
you get infinities.

321
00:18:37.170 --> 00:18:40.170
Physicists don't like infinities computer scientists don't like infinities.

322
00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:44.970
Mathematicians love infinities but so,
but we don't.
So,

323
00:18:44.971 --> 00:18:47.280
so the,
the idea is how to get around them.

324
00:18:47.490 --> 00:18:52.020
And this was a fascinating and severe problem is so severe that actually in the

325
00:18:52.021 --> 00:18:54.330
1960s,
when it was kind of first recognized,

326
00:18:54.780 --> 00:18:57.270
many physicists were willing to give up the pretty picture.

327
00:18:58.110 --> 00:19:01.440
They said maybe this unification of relativity and quantum mechanics just

328
00:19:01.441 --> 00:19:03.750
doesn't work on the scale of nuclei.

329
00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:09.270
And it was kind of amazing how easily they were willing to give up this picture.

330
00:19:09.271 --> 00:19:12.120
And one of the things about the book is as,

331
00:19:12.330 --> 00:19:14.760
which is one of the reasons is the greatest story.

332
00:19:14.761 --> 00:19:16.440
It wasn't easy in particularly,

333
00:19:16.441 --> 00:19:21.060
there are lots of red herrings and dead ends and physicists are people,

334
00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:25.500
and that means they're pigheaded and prejudice and biased.

335
00:19:25.950 --> 00:19:29.520
And they often want to go in a direction even when that direction is futile.

336
00:19:30.050 --> 00:19:30.390
Okay.

337
00:19:30.390 --> 00:19:34.650
But the great thing about science is it drags the physicists are the scientists

338
00:19:34.651 --> 00:19:36.570
kicking and screaming in the right direction.

339
00:19:36.571 --> 00:19:39.240
So the individual scientists may be prejudice,
but,
uh,

340
00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:42.360
eventually because of nature,
they're forced in the right direction.

341
00:19:42.630 --> 00:19:44.550
And this case,
these people,
you know,

342
00:19:44.551 --> 00:19:46.260
and especially actually it was interesting in Berkeley,

343
00:19:46.261 --> 00:19:48.210
was the main place where people want to give this up.

344
00:19:48.211 --> 00:19:50.670
And they created a kind of Zen version of physics,

345
00:19:50.671 --> 00:19:52.490
which is appropriate for Berkeley in the 60s.

346
00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:56.250
And it was the sound of one particle clapping basically.
Um,

347
00:19:57.480 --> 00:19:58.860
but it was actually,

348
00:19:58.861 --> 00:20:02.190
it was the basis of string theory got generated there as a way,

349
00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:06.960
an alternative to this picture.
And it failed miserably there too.
But,
but uh,

350
00:20:06.961 --> 00:20:08.820
that's a different book.
Uh,

351
00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:13.290
the point is that these people were looking at the problem and you want to shake

352
00:20:13.291 --> 00:20:15.210
them because in fact,
they had,

353
00:20:15.211 --> 00:20:18.450
the answer was the answer was right there for people if they hadn't been looking

354
00:20:18.451 --> 00:20:19.290
in the wrong direction.

355
00:20:19.410 --> 00:20:23.670
With hindsight is so much easier to see things to see that the answer was right

356
00:20:23.671 --> 00:20:27.390
there.
And the answer came from very different area of physics superconductivity.

357
00:20:28.230 --> 00:20:32.760
So 1911 cameras [inaudible] discovered a Dutch physicists discovered that if he

358
00:20:32.850 --> 00:20:37.260
did,
if he called mercury down to four degrees above absolute zero,

359
00:20:38.340 --> 00:20:43.290
then the resistance went to zero.
Didn't just it come small,
it went to zero.

360
00:20:43.860 --> 00:20:47.140
And that means if I have a mercury wire and I hook it up to a battery and I

361
00:20:47.141 --> 00:20:50.920
started current going and then I cooled to four degrees,
I take away the battery,

362
00:20:51.250 --> 00:20:55.630
then the current continues to flow and it doesn't just flow for an hour or a
day.

363
00:20:55.660 --> 00:20:56.560
It flows forever.

364
00:20:56.980 --> 00:21:01.210
It never ever stops cause resistance is priced precisely zero.

365
00:21:01.570 --> 00:21:04.180
It seems like it shouldn't be possible,
but it is.

366
00:21:04.660 --> 00:21:08.890
It's a remarkable phenomena that he named superconductivity and it's so weird

367
00:21:08.891 --> 00:21:12.970
that it took maybe 50 years to be able to have a theory of this and it has to

368
00:21:12.971 --> 00:21:17.110
with a rather complicated interactions of electrons in materials,
which is nice.

369
00:21:17.111 --> 00:21:20.320
Okay,
so what's this got to do with what I just discussed?

370
00:21:20.321 --> 00:21:23.710
Well nowadays we have high temperature superconductors so we can do need

371
00:21:23.711 --> 00:21:27.660
experiments and high school physics classes cause we can put a superconductor

372
00:21:27.730 --> 00:21:31.660
now in dry ice and there's some materials that becomes superconducting at those

373
00:21:31.661 --> 00:21:35.200
temperatures.
And then we can play with them in high school classes.

374
00:21:35.201 --> 00:21:35.980
And for example,

375
00:21:35.980 --> 00:21:38.680
if you have a superconductor and dry ice and you put a magnet above it,

376
00:21:38.830 --> 00:21:42.280
the magnet will levitate.
Why?

377
00:21:42.370 --> 00:21:46.870
Because it turns out magnetic fields cannot pierce the superconductor.

378
00:21:46.900 --> 00:21:49.630
They die off the surfaces superconductors,
so to electric fields.

379
00:21:49.780 --> 00:21:52.990
But that means the magnetic field lines basically get repelled by the

380
00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:56.830
superconductor,
and that's enough to levitate the the magnet.

381
00:21:56.831 --> 00:22:01.330
It's a fun little game to play in class.
Okay?
Again,

382
00:22:01.420 --> 00:22:03.550
what's this got to do with anything?
Well,

383
00:22:03.551 --> 00:22:06.190
now I want you to imagine that you live in this super conductor

384
00:22:08.380 --> 00:22:11.680
and now you,
I asked you what are the laws of physics not superconductor?
Well,

385
00:22:11.681 --> 00:22:13.690
for you,
if you live in that superconductor,

386
00:22:14.110 --> 00:22:18.970
electromagnetism is a short range force because electric fields and magnetic

387
00:22:18.971 --> 00:22:22.870
fields,
when they answer the superconductor die off exponentially fast.

388
00:22:22.870 --> 00:22:25.810
It turns out.
So if you have a quantum theory,

389
00:22:25.811 --> 00:22:27.940
if you develop quantum mechanics and that superconductor,

390
00:22:28.150 --> 00:22:30.920
you'll describe electromagnetism is a short range force,

391
00:22:30.940 --> 00:22:33.880
and that will mean that the particle that's exchanged is massive.

392
00:22:34.990 --> 00:22:39.160
And indeed in a superconductor,
photons are massive.

393
00:22:40.390 --> 00:22:42.730
They have mass.
They have their master's out here.

394
00:22:42.850 --> 00:22:45.490
They traveled the speed of light and a superconductor.
They're massive.

395
00:22:45.491 --> 00:22:49.420
They travel much slower.
It's just the way it is.
Now,
again,

396
00:22:49.421 --> 00:22:52.420
this should start bells ringing in your head,

397
00:22:52.630 --> 00:22:56.560
but it didn't for the physicist at the time until finally,

398
00:22:56.590 --> 00:22:58.450
someone began to think about,
well,
what if,

399
00:22:58.900 --> 00:23:03.340
what if we live in a cosmic superconductor?
And what if it's like,

400
00:23:03.370 --> 00:23:07.390
like swimming in water?
Okay,
you swim in water,
you feel you're really fast.

401
00:23:07.391 --> 00:23:11.200
And maybe Google has a pool here.
Probably does.
I don't know.
And um,

402
00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:14.910
and but what if you fill it up with molasses?
Oops,
sorry.
What if you,

403
00:23:14.980 --> 00:23:18.100
what if you fill it up with molasses instead of water?
Well,

404
00:23:18.101 --> 00:23:21.400
then you won't want to go swimming first of all,
but,
but if you did go swimming,

405
00:23:21.580 --> 00:23:24.370
you'd swim a lot slower.
It'd be a lot harder.
You'd feel a lot more massive.

406
00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:28.150
So what if we live in a cosmic superconductor and everywhere through space,

407
00:23:28.540 --> 00:23:33.360
I can't resist this everywhere through space.
There's an invisible field,
um,

408
00:23:33.820 --> 00:23:34.450
uh,

409
00:23:34.450 --> 00:23:39.450
permeating all of space and some particles interact with that field and get

410
00:23:43.301 --> 00:23:47.600
resistance and appear as if they're massive and other particles don't.

411
00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:51.830
What if that were the case?
Well then you could draw these pictures.

412
00:23:51.831 --> 00:23:54.800
He's finding dogs.
This is the one I showed you before,
but turns sideways.

413
00:23:55.190 --> 00:23:58.030
And these are the ones for the,
for the weak force,
the one that has a,

414
00:23:58.031 --> 00:24:01.970
produces that electron neutrino in terms of the three particles involved.

415
00:24:01.970 --> 00:24:02.810
But that doesn't matter.

416
00:24:03.320 --> 00:24:07.340
But now what if these particles are massless just like the Photon,

417
00:24:07.850 --> 00:24:12.050
but they interact with this invisible background field that's everywhere and

418
00:24:12.051 --> 00:24:15.590
they act like they're massive in our superconducting world.

419
00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:20.060
And that means that the force they mediate looks like it's short range.

420
00:24:21.470 --> 00:24:22.890
Well,
that would explain how it can be short.

421
00:24:22.970 --> 00:24:26.390
But the neat thing is if they're massless,
then the mathematics of,

422
00:24:26.540 --> 00:24:30.770
of the calculations evolved by the exchange of these massless particles is the

423
00:24:30.771 --> 00:24:32.960
same as that for a photon.
And in fact,

424
00:24:32.961 --> 00:24:37.900
instead of producing infinities it producers correct results.
Moreover,
in fact,

425
00:24:37.910 --> 00:24:42.260
the mathematics is identical.
So not only do these forces appear similar,

426
00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:44.720
in fact they could be the same force.

427
00:24:45.500 --> 00:24:48.830
And nowadays the picture is that these two forces,

428
00:24:48.831 --> 00:24:50.900
which are so different in the world in which we live,

429
00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:53.420
each of which is responsible for our existence,

430
00:24:54.050 --> 00:24:55.870
the electric electromagnetic interactions,

431
00:24:55.880 --> 00:24:58.460
responsible for all the interactions in the biology of your body.

432
00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:02.930
The weak force is actually responsible for the processes that power of the Sun

433
00:25:03.350 --> 00:25:05.120
as well as the existence of heavy nuclei.

434
00:25:05.660 --> 00:25:08.840
And both of them are essential for existence.
But

435
00:25:10.520 --> 00:25:14.360
although they're very different,
they're really the same at a fundamental level.

436
00:25:14.361 --> 00:25:15.380
And at a fundamental level,

437
00:25:15.381 --> 00:25:19.010
they wouldn't look at all like the forces we see in the world in which we live.

438
00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:21.020
This increase,

439
00:25:21.020 --> 00:25:26.020
we were dragged to this picture unwillingly as I say,

440
00:25:26.130 --> 00:25:28.670
and and for a long time,
a lot of people went in other directions.

441
00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:33.110
And it's amazing to think that we were willing to picture a universe that is so

442
00:25:34.730 --> 00:25:38.150
distinct from the university in which we live so uninhabitable if you wish.

443
00:25:38.270 --> 00:25:41.090
So foreign and so alien.
It's one of the wonders,

444
00:25:41.270 --> 00:25:45.590
one of the great aspects of science and art and music and literature,

445
00:25:45.860 --> 00:25:50.240
is it forces us to view our own perspective of our place in the cosmos

446
00:25:50.241 --> 00:25:52.820
differently in a way that may not be the way we wanted.

447
00:25:53.540 --> 00:25:57.230
So it's an amazing intellectual triumph to propose that.
And it apparently works.

448
00:25:57.231 --> 00:26:01.310
But at this point it's kind of religious,
right?

449
00:26:01.311 --> 00:26:02.480
It just think of what I just said.

450
00:26:02.780 --> 00:26:06.810
Imagine there's an invisible blackground field everywhere throughout nature that

451
00:26:07.220 --> 00:26:09.680
that,
uh,
determines why you exist.
Okay.

452
00:26:09.681 --> 00:26:14.180
It sounds a lot like things you would have heard the Bible or star wars or

453
00:26:14.181 --> 00:26:17.480
something like that.
So,
and it wouldn't be,

454
00:26:17.481 --> 00:26:20.710
it would be just an extraordinary claim without evidence,
which is you,

455
00:26:20.750 --> 00:26:25.610
which is religion and it isn't though.
Cause it's physics.

456
00:26:26.300 --> 00:26:28.940
And what does that mean?
That means we have,
if it's there,
we have to find it.

457
00:26:29.450 --> 00:26:32.030
So if this invisible background fields,
it's weird,

458
00:26:32.060 --> 00:26:35.150
ridiculous picture is true and it is a ridiculous picture.

459
00:26:35.330 --> 00:26:38.540
It's one we should be highly skeptical of.
If it's true,
we better find it.

460
00:26:38.690 --> 00:26:39.530
How do you find it?

461
00:26:40.730 --> 00:26:44.490
Cosmic sadomasochism we spank the vacuum.

462
00:26:45.060 --> 00:26:48.510
You spank it hard?
What do I mean?
Well,

463
00:26:48.511 --> 00:26:51.840
all fields in quantum physics,

464
00:26:51.841 --> 00:26:53.760
all fields are related to particles.

465
00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:57.210
So if I dump enough energy at a single point in space,

466
00:26:57.420 --> 00:26:59.130
and let's call this field the Higgs field,

467
00:26:59.850 --> 00:27:01.830
if I dump enough energy and a single point in space,

468
00:27:01.831 --> 00:27:05.010
maybe I'll kick out real particles associate with that Higgs field or column

469
00:27:05.011 --> 00:27:08.190
Higgs particles.
How can you do that?

470
00:27:08.370 --> 00:27:11.130
Will you build the most complicated machines humans have ever built?

471
00:27:11.160 --> 00:27:14.370
In this case,
the large Hadron collider in Geneva,
Switzerland,

472
00:27:15.090 --> 00:27:18.900
which is a particle accelerator.
It's located in Geneva,
and in fact,

473
00:27:18.901 --> 00:27:21.960
if you go to the airport,
and I'm Google probably has an off officers there.

474
00:27:22.230 --> 00:27:26.160
If you go there and you'll see the lake and then the little water spout there,

475
00:27:26.370 --> 00:27:28.710
but underneath the farmland right outside the airport,

476
00:27:28.711 --> 00:27:30.480
which is beautiful pastoral farmland,

477
00:27:30.780 --> 00:27:35.780
a hundred meters below the surface is a tunnel that's 26 kilometers around.

478
00:27:37.380 --> 00:27:42.330
And what we do is we accelerate protons at 99.999999,

479
00:27:42.331 --> 00:27:44.940
nine,
nine,
nine,
8% the speed of light in one direction,

480
00:27:45.540 --> 00:27:49.230
and then protons at 99.99999,
nine,
nine,
nine,

481
00:27:49.231 --> 00:27:50.940
8% the speed of light in the other direction.

482
00:27:51.300 --> 00:27:53.250
And we try and collide them in a certain points,

483
00:27:53.670 --> 00:27:55.650
three different points in the data.
In this circle,

484
00:27:55.800 --> 00:27:59.880
they will run thousands of times every second.
Here's the French Swiss border,

485
00:28:00.060 --> 00:28:02.640
by the way.
So they crossed the border without passports and all that,

486
00:28:03.660 --> 00:28:08.100
thousands of times each second,
which Trump would want to change,
no doubt,
but,

487
00:28:08.580 --> 00:28:10.170
but uh,
we end,

488
00:28:10.171 --> 00:28:14.880
this machine was built to be able to see if we could kick particles out of empty

489
00:28:14.881 --> 00:28:17.640
space and kick kicks and producing six particles.

490
00:28:17.641 --> 00:28:22.250
Do this ridiculous picture actually worked.
Now in this country,
we have an uh,

491
00:28:22.500 --> 00:28:25.680
sort of,
uh,
an acronystic day we celebrate called July 4th,

492
00:28:25.681 --> 00:28:29.460
which doesn't mean anything to anyone else,
but now it has a cosmic significance.

493
00:28:29.460 --> 00:28:34.350
Cause on July 4th,
2012,
we reported 50 events

494
00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:40.080
produced in the large Hadron collider that looked like Higgs is that walked like

495
00:28:40.081 --> 00:28:43.350
Higgs.
Is that cracked?
Like Higgs is and we thought we're Higgs is okay.

496
00:28:43.530 --> 00:28:46.170
And in the intro,
any five years now,
almost five years,

497
00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:51.660
all of the experiments of fine tuned those results and they have exactly the

498
00:28:51.661 --> 00:28:56.220
properties that were predicted of the Higgs particle.
Exactly.

499
00:28:56.310 --> 00:29:00.610
This is an amazing triumph because it means that this ridiculous picture we,

500
00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:04.440
which,
which we are pushed to is real.

501
00:29:05.430 --> 00:29:08.160
It means we really live inside of a cosmic superconductor.

502
00:29:09.540 --> 00:29:13.050
And it means that we were driven not just to propose that picture,

503
00:29:13.230 --> 00:29:16.920
but to build this remarkably complex machine to do it.

504
00:29:17.100 --> 00:29:19.660
And to me this is humanity at its best.
This,

505
00:29:19.810 --> 00:29:22.470
their willingness to go where nature takes us first of all,

506
00:29:22.680 --> 00:29:24.750
independent of whether it's or whether we want to go,

507
00:29:25.260 --> 00:29:29.700
but then to amass the resources to look at,

508
00:29:30.390 --> 00:29:34.720
to build this machine just to determine why we're here.
And,

509
00:29:35.250 --> 00:29:39.450
and of course one of the benefits of science,
which many people,

510
00:29:39.451 --> 00:29:42.910
Harold and is responsible for all your jobs is technology,

511
00:29:44.110 --> 00:29:45.340
which is great,
but you know,

512
00:29:45.341 --> 00:29:48.990
it's a little bit unfortunate too because that means when,

513
00:29:49.050 --> 00:29:52.020
when you have science and people always say to me,
well what good is it?
What,

514
00:29:52.030 --> 00:29:54.490
what does it,
does it make a better toaster?
Doesn't make a faster computer.

515
00:29:54.491 --> 00:29:56.620
What is it?
And if it doesn't do those things,
it's,

516
00:29:56.621 --> 00:29:58.210
it looks like it has no utility.

517
00:29:58.480 --> 00:30:03.480
But of course we don't ask those things about a Mozart Concerto or a Picasso

518
00:30:03.971 --> 00:30:05.080
painting or,
or,

519
00:30:05.140 --> 00:30:09.580
or a Shakespeare play or you pick your favorite whenever an Eric Clapton Song,

520
00:30:09.581 --> 00:30:13.540
whatever.
And Science is exactly the same.

521
00:30:13.541 --> 00:30:16.630
The real virtue of science is exactly what I said earlier,

522
00:30:16.810 --> 00:30:21.130
not the technology it produces,
which is nice,
but its cultural significance,

523
00:30:21.340 --> 00:30:23.600
which is the fact that it forces us to cheat,

524
00:30:24.190 --> 00:30:28.540
to get out of my myopic picture of ourselves,
just like art,
music and literature.

525
00:30:28.630 --> 00:30:30.250
To see ourselves in a broader sense,

526
00:30:30.251 --> 00:30:32.920
to get a better perspective of our place in the cosmos in this case,

527
00:30:32.921 --> 00:30:37.020
to be willing to build these amazing machines.
I call the large Hadron Collider,

528
00:30:37.021 --> 00:30:39.220
that Gothic Cathedral of the 21st century.

529
00:30:39.930 --> 00:30:44.140
The gothic cathedrals were beautiful things built over centuries by thousands of

530
00:30:44.141 --> 00:30:48.100
artisans using the highest technology at the time.

531
00:30:48.101 --> 00:30:50.560
They didn't know how to make these ceilings so they wouldn't fall in for a long

532
00:30:50.561 --> 00:30:53.710
time.
All working together.
Well,

533
00:30:53.711 --> 00:30:58.711
the large Hadron collider was built by 10,000 phd physicists and and then many

534
00:30:59.201 --> 00:31:03.520
more engineers in fact from over a hundred different countries.

535
00:31:03.700 --> 00:31:05.560
Speaking does is different languages,

536
00:31:05.561 --> 00:31:09.310
many different religions all working together for a single purpose,

537
00:31:09.311 --> 00:31:12.550
which is what science can do.
It can unify people from all cultures.

538
00:31:12.551 --> 00:31:13.420
It's what Google does here.

539
00:31:13.421 --> 00:31:16.690
Look at all the people from different cultures working for a common purpose.

540
00:31:16.691 --> 00:31:19.900
That's what science does.
That's humanity at its best.

541
00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:23.860
And the machines are unbelievably interesting.
Complicated.

542
00:31:23.861 --> 00:31:26.830
This is one of the smaller detect,
well one of the larger detectors,
sorry,

543
00:31:27.010 --> 00:31:29.860
it's not the machine,
it's just a detector in the machine.

544
00:31:29.861 --> 00:31:33.670
The smaller detector have here is this called a compact mew on solar annoyed,

545
00:31:33.940 --> 00:31:35.320
which is not so compact.

546
00:31:35.800 --> 00:31:39.460
It has this same amount of iron as the Eiffel Tower for example.

547
00:31:39.790 --> 00:31:43.120
It's hard to see it.
I have a better picture of it cause I'm there.
Um,

548
00:31:43.150 --> 00:31:46.750
but it's really you when you go there and if you do go to and when the machine's

549
00:31:46.751 --> 00:31:50.950
down,
you can ever know and then go down and just amazing to see the scale of

550
00:31:50.951 --> 00:31:55.900
everything compared to the scale we exist that,
but the machine,
you can't,

551
00:31:55.920 --> 00:31:57.540
it's,
you can't have almost enough hyperbole.

552
00:31:57.541 --> 00:32:00.100
I have a whole chapter in the book about,
in,
for example,

553
00:32:00.250 --> 00:32:01.780
every second of the large Hadron Collider,

554
00:32:01.781 --> 00:32:05.620
enough data is generated to more than 1,001 terabyte hard drives.
Okay.

555
00:32:05.621 --> 00:32:07.720
Which is relevant to all of you.
And it's every second.

556
00:32:07.900 --> 00:32:09.970
We have to process that much information,
a thousand,

557
00:32:10.300 --> 00:32:13.900
a thousand terabytes of information in that experiment.

558
00:32:14.290 --> 00:32:17.440
And that means as you can imagine,
that you have to filter that information and,

559
00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:21.580
and it's incredibly complicated but interesting from a computer science point of

560
00:32:21.581 --> 00:32:25.570
view.
But it more than just that for example,
the,

561
00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:27.130
the tunnel that it's in,

562
00:32:27.160 --> 00:32:30.820
it has to be evacuated that 26 kilometer long tunnel has to be evacuated.

563
00:32:30.821 --> 00:32:34.120
So it's vacuum is sparser than the vacuum outside the international space

564
00:32:34.121 --> 00:32:37.930
station.
Every aspect of the machine is remarkable.

565
00:32:38.380 --> 00:32:40.070
And the fact that we're willing to do this,

566
00:32:40.280 --> 00:32:45.220
to just address this question of why we're here,
it seems to me to be,
uh,
the,

567
00:32:45.260 --> 00:32:48.890
the bravery of the people who devoted their lives to building this and the

568
00:32:48.891 --> 00:32:51.270
people who have devoted their lives to coming up with a theory is,
is,

569
00:32:51.580 --> 00:32:52.413
is one thing.

570
00:32:52.490 --> 00:32:56.060
But the thing part of my book that maybe that part of the title that's the best

571
00:32:56.270 --> 00:32:57.350
is the so far apart,

572
00:32:58.280 --> 00:33:01.550
the greatest story ever told so far because the story gets better.

573
00:33:01.551 --> 00:33:03.770
Unlike that other story called the greatest story ever told,

574
00:33:03.980 --> 00:33:07.850
which is written down by Iron Age peasants who didn't know the earth orbiting

575
00:33:07.851 --> 00:33:11.870
the sun is still the same,
just as boring and untrue.

576
00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:16.910
This one changes and it doesn't change US cause cause we like it.

577
00:33:16.911 --> 00:33:20.480
It changes because every time we open a new window on the universe,

578
00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:25.700
we're surprised and we're forced out of our comfort zone.
And,
and I,
you know,

579
00:33:25.701 --> 00:33:28.380
so I think of this,
I happen to like impressionist art and,

580
00:33:28.381 --> 00:33:29.690
and I like art in general,

581
00:33:29.960 --> 00:33:34.190
but why we like I'm an impression to start is that it's beautiful from a

582
00:33:34.191 --> 00:33:38.480
distance,
but when you get close up it's really crappy.
Okay.
And that's,

583
00:33:38.720 --> 00:33:41.600
that's science because great.

584
00:33:41.601 --> 00:33:44.690
We've developed this incredible model called the standard model that explains

585
00:33:44.900 --> 00:33:48.770
every experiment we can ever have ever been able to perform in particle physics.

586
00:33:48.980 --> 00:33:51.860
But then the minute you make that discovery,
there are always new questions.

587
00:33:52.190 --> 00:33:56.180
Why did this Higgs field form in the early universe,
why did it freeze in place?

588
00:33:56.181 --> 00:33:59.930
Why did freeze the way it did?
So that we,
it resulting in our existence,

589
00:34:00.110 --> 00:34:01.310
all of these new questions,

590
00:34:01.430 --> 00:34:05.420
and the point is this story will get better because the next January people,

591
00:34:05.421 --> 00:34:09.260
as long as we continue to ask questions and have the courage to be able to look

592
00:34:09.261 --> 00:34:12.620
out and try and find the answers,
the story's going to get better.

593
00:34:13.910 --> 00:34:18.910
And a story will get better and more interesting and produce a universe that may

594
00:34:20.481 --> 00:34:22.610
seem more strange.
And,

595
00:34:23.150 --> 00:34:26.750
and that story that we've developed and that we've now validated,
as I say,

596
00:34:26.751 --> 00:34:27.680
is a story which,

597
00:34:29.570 --> 00:34:34.220
which is terrifying at the same time as it's awesome.

598
00:34:34.610 --> 00:34:37.070
And the consequences are ones we may or may not.
Like.

599
00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:38.990
One of the first consequences,
as they said,

600
00:34:38.991 --> 00:34:42.410
is that our existence is a cosmic accident in a real sense.

601
00:34:42.740 --> 00:34:45.470
Just the same as that,
that uh,
on that window sill,

602
00:34:46.330 --> 00:34:49.130
I mean those people who live there,
okay,

603
00:34:49.131 --> 00:34:53.030
that that direction is very special and it means a lot to that civilization just

604
00:34:53.031 --> 00:34:57.040
as all of the facets of our universe that looked like it make the universe is

605
00:34:57.050 --> 00:35:01.610
designed for us to therefore make it seem special,
are accidents.

606
00:35:01.910 --> 00:35:05.280
The underlying universe is not only not designed for us,
but as I said,

607
00:35:05.281 --> 00:35:06.770
to antithetical to our existence.

608
00:35:06.920 --> 00:35:09.680
Because if theW and z particles and all of the particles in nature where

609
00:35:09.700 --> 00:35:12.260
massless as they are at a fundamental level,

610
00:35:12.261 --> 00:35:15.020
if it weren't for this field frozen in the universe,

611
00:35:15.380 --> 00:35:18.290
then we wouldn't exist because no,
no bound objects could exist.

612
00:35:18.291 --> 00:35:20.690
There wouldn't be any people,
any stars and the galaxies,

613
00:35:20.691 --> 00:35:23.750
anything that we could see and these,

614
00:35:23.930 --> 00:35:26.150
these fas physicists on this window,

615
00:35:26.240 --> 00:35:28.730
on this crystal might eventually discover that,
you know what?

616
00:35:28.970 --> 00:35:33.110
This is just an accident of our existence.
Said crystals in different directions,

617
00:35:33.111 --> 00:35:35.120
conform it.
There's nothing special about that direction.

618
00:35:35.660 --> 00:35:38.040
And maybe they'll just cover that at like in the morning one day,

619
00:35:38.520 --> 00:35:42.950
but then at six in the morning,
the sun will rise in Seattle that you may not.

620
00:35:42.990 --> 00:35:47.050
There's this thing called Sun and and and it,
and,

621
00:35:47.100 --> 00:35:49.080
and melt all these crystals.
Okay.

622
00:35:49.081 --> 00:35:51.660
Then there's symmetry restored it to be no preferred direction.

623
00:35:51.960 --> 00:35:54.210
But the unfortunate thing is these people wouldn't exist anymore.

624
00:35:54.840 --> 00:35:56.340
And the interesting thing,

625
00:35:56.760 --> 00:36:00.570
and maybe terrifying thing is that if you actually look at the Higgs field and

626
00:36:00.571 --> 00:36:04.830
look at the value it has,
then it's just teetering on the edge of melting.

627
00:36:06.140 --> 00:36:09.300
Okay.
It just,
the Higgs particle happens,
have a mass.

628
00:36:09.301 --> 00:36:12.270
It's very close to the mass where if you look at the model,

629
00:36:13.020 --> 00:36:16.770
the field could be unstable and melt.
And if that were to happen in our universe,

630
00:36:17.010 --> 00:36:21.390
then then of course everything we see disappears.
Okay.

631
00:36:21.660 --> 00:36:25.870
Now don't be,
don't be worried.
There's still time to buy books and stuff.
But,

632
00:36:26.100 --> 00:36:30.480
but more than that,
if you actually do the calculations,
it's probably stable.

633
00:36:30.481 --> 00:36:31.590
But even if it's unstable,

634
00:36:31.890 --> 00:36:34.320
if you work out the time frame over which it might decay,

635
00:36:34.321 --> 00:36:36.510
it's not a million years.
Not Billionaires are not a trillion years,

636
00:36:36.511 --> 00:36:38.600
not even a trillion,
trillion year.
So it's,
it's,

637
00:36:38.850 --> 00:36:41.040
this is a long process if it's going to end,

638
00:36:41.041 --> 00:36:45.840
but if it does the universal revert to this symmetric beautiful form,
but it,
but,

639
00:36:46.020 --> 00:36:48.740
but then there'll be no life.
So even this beautiful university,

640
00:36:48.741 --> 00:36:52.210
it looks like it's designed for us will disappear and,
and will,

641
00:36:52.211 --> 00:36:53.880
there's certainly be no life like we see.

642
00:36:54.240 --> 00:36:57.310
And that I want to just end with,

643
00:36:57.311 --> 00:37:01.080
with some notes about how this picture relates to this sort of history of

644
00:37:01.081 --> 00:37:04.680
science in a,
in a,
in a,
in a,
in a real way.
Because

645
00:37:06.240 --> 00:37:10.890
we are,
we're evolutionarily evolved to look for design.

646
00:37:11.640 --> 00:37:15.240
We always look for designs.
We were on eyes pick it up very well.

647
00:37:15.241 --> 00:37:17.430
And many of you are our talented looking for design,

648
00:37:17.431 --> 00:37:21.300
which is probably why you're where you're here.
Okay.
But,

649
00:37:21.720 --> 00:37:25.920
but that design may not really be there.
And we have to second guess ourselves.

650
00:37:25.921 --> 00:37:27.360
One of the things that Fiman really said,

651
00:37:27.361 --> 00:37:31.500
which is quite important is the easiest person to fool is yourself because you

652
00:37:31.501 --> 00:37:35.080
like something or you want it to be that case.
And we all want design.
We,

653
00:37:35.081 --> 00:37:35.341
you know,

654
00:37:35.341 --> 00:37:38.400
you can think of human things that are developed like Christmas ornaments.

655
00:37:38.670 --> 00:37:41.630
They're clearly designed,
but of course those aren't Christmas ornaments.

656
00:37:41.650 --> 00:37:45.510
Those are snowflakes that you just give me a polar molecule and laws of

657
00:37:45.511 --> 00:37:49.200
chemistry and physics and our produce,
these beautiful things without any design.

658
00:37:49.740 --> 00:37:54.700
But you might say,
well what about human structures like the Google plex or,
or,

659
00:37:54.710 --> 00:37:59.040
or this building or are my favorite is Buckminster fuller domes.

660
00:37:59.041 --> 00:38:00.120
Cause when I was growing up,

661
00:38:00.150 --> 00:38:04.500
every hippie had one and lived in them and didn't eat things in them.

662
00:38:04.920 --> 00:38:08.880
And uh,
and,
and,
but there are evidence of,
of an very interesting intellect,

663
00:38:08.881 --> 00:38:13.710
Buckminster fuller,
who was a really interesting guy.
Crazy but interesting.
Well,

664
00:38:13.740 --> 00:38:16.740
just take sought bar.
Take Soda.
If you take,

665
00:38:17.020 --> 00:38:21.240
you'll find out in the sorta part of our molecules called carbon 60 we now call

666
00:38:21.241 --> 00:38:24.390
Buckminster fuller marine,
which are beautiful geodesic domes.

667
00:38:24.660 --> 00:38:26.610
And there's nothing less designed that soot.

668
00:38:27.450 --> 00:38:30.660
So we have to be careful when we look for design in nature.

669
00:38:30.840 --> 00:38:33.420
The first real example of this was from one,
of course,

670
00:38:33.620 --> 00:38:37.680
the greatest scientists of all time.
Charles Darwin and,

671
00:38:37.730 --> 00:38:40.150
and if you haven't read the origin of the species,

672
00:38:40.151 --> 00:38:42.370
the last paragraph of it is really beautiful.

673
00:38:42.371 --> 00:38:45.550
One of the most beautiful lines in any science book,
any everywhere.

674
00:38:45.880 --> 00:38:49.000
There's grand jury in this view of life with its several powers having been

675
00:38:49.180 --> 00:38:53.440
originally breathed into a few forms or into one and that whilst this planet has

676
00:38:53.441 --> 00:38:57.060
gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity from so simple,

677
00:38:57.061 --> 00:38:58.660
a beginning,
endless forms,

678
00:38:58.661 --> 00:39:03.220
most beautiful and most wonderful have been and are being evolved now.

679
00:39:03.220 --> 00:39:06.460
This was a beautiful discussion of how the complexity and diversity of life on

680
00:39:06.461 --> 00:39:07.030
earth,

681
00:39:07.030 --> 00:39:11.770
which appears to be designed could arise naturally from a simple beginnings by

682
00:39:11.771 --> 00:39:13.150
natural selection and evolution.

683
00:39:13.420 --> 00:39:18.070
And that design like the fact that bees could find flowers was not designed,

684
00:39:18.100 --> 00:39:20.700
it was a,
if they couldn't see the colors of flowers,
they wouldn't reproduce.

685
00:39:20.960 --> 00:39:24.190
And it could be understood from much more simple principles and you could get

686
00:39:24.370 --> 00:39:26.710
incredible complexity from simplicity.

687
00:39:27.220 --> 00:39:31.720
This same paragraph could be used to describe the university we physicists are

688
00:39:31.721 --> 00:39:35.080
talking about from so simple beginnings with the forces of nature may have been

689
00:39:35.081 --> 00:39:36.430
unified in a simple way.

690
00:39:36.760 --> 00:39:41.440
We as the universe evolve produce through structures like all the stars and

691
00:39:41.441 --> 00:39:46.441
galaxies and people and all of the structures we see today by a simple process.

692
00:39:46.840 --> 00:39:50.560
And,
and that universe is no more designed for us.

693
00:39:50.770 --> 00:39:55.720
Then life is that we're carrying on that Darwinian process,
which is,

694
00:39:55.990 --> 00:40:00.010
which for many people is disturbing because they want the universe to be

695
00:40:00.011 --> 00:40:02.680
designed for them.
It's comforting,
okay?

696
00:40:02.681 --> 00:40:06.970
But the universe doesn't give a damn what we want.
And we have to learn that,

697
00:40:07.480 --> 00:40:12.040
you know,
the universities make terrifying,
but it's also incredibly awesome.

698
00:40:12.580 --> 00:40:15.160
Not a university isn't designed for us,
can actually be more interesting.

699
00:40:16.540 --> 00:40:20.620
It can be one in which our lives are more precious.

700
00:40:20.621 --> 00:40:23.950
Cause the only purpose we make [inaudible] only personally have as a purpose we

701
00:40:23.951 --> 00:40:26.340
make.
But you know,
scientists,
as I said,

702
00:40:26.360 --> 00:40:30.040
individual scientists are products of their time.
So in a letter,
Joseph Hooker,

703
00:40:30.041 --> 00:40:33.520
he said it's mere rubbish.
Thinking at present of the origin of life.

704
00:40:33.521 --> 00:40:37.690
One might as well think of the origin of matter and in [inaudible] 63 it was

705
00:40:37.691 --> 00:40:41.710
rubbish to think of the origin of the matter,
but now I get paid to do it.
Okay.

706
00:40:41.711 --> 00:40:43.390
Because the story has gotten better,

707
00:40:44.020 --> 00:40:48.460
the story has gotten better because we continue to push the boundaries in our

708
00:40:48.461 --> 00:40:51.730
thinking,
but more equally important in our looking out,

709
00:40:52.390 --> 00:40:56.650
we continue to be willing to build experiments and look out and be willing to

710
00:40:56.651 --> 00:41:00.490
change our perspective even if it takes us in a direction we don't want to go

711
00:41:01.100 --> 00:41:01.590
and,

712
00:41:01.590 --> 00:41:05.830
and I want to end by in some sense by saying I'm worried about this future in

713
00:41:05.831 --> 00:41:09.970
the,
at the present,
in the current budget,
for example,

714
00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:13.990
proposed by the president,
the entire field,
I talked about particle physics.

715
00:41:14.350 --> 00:41:17.950
The support for that has being reduced by 20% $900 million,

716
00:41:18.190 --> 00:41:20.380
but more importantly the agency that supports it,

717
00:41:20.381 --> 00:41:24.790
which is the Department of Energy which most people don't realize is the chief

718
00:41:24.791 --> 00:41:28.990
funder of all physical science in our country.
Not just energy research,

719
00:41:28.991 --> 00:41:32.260
but all physical science in our country is being caught by 20%.

720
00:41:33.410 --> 00:41:34.161
At the same time.

721
00:41:34.161 --> 00:41:36.680
The National Endowment for the humanities is being caught completely.

722
00:41:36.681 --> 00:41:40.210
The National Endowment for the arts cut completely.
The national,
um,

723
00:41:40.280 --> 00:41:44.630
the corporation for public broadcasting cut completely the institute of Museums

724
00:41:44.631 --> 00:41:45.381
and libraries,

725
00:41:45.381 --> 00:41:48.470
which supports museums and libraries around the country cut completely.

726
00:41:49.460 --> 00:41:54.420
You add all that up and you get 1.8 $2 billion savings in our budget.
Okay.

727
00:41:54.800 --> 00:41:58.130
In the same budget for host a $2 billion line item,

728
00:41:58.310 --> 00:42:02.210
which is the first installment of a,
of a wall with Mexico.
Okay,

729
00:42:02.390 --> 00:42:06.050
so you got this wall that's going to protect us from hordes that are unknown at

730
00:42:06.051 --> 00:42:10.640
the same time killing all of the sport for culture and largely this port for

731
00:42:10.641 --> 00:42:11.620
science and,
and,

732
00:42:11.640 --> 00:42:15.710
and the way to picture that was actually to me express best by Robert Wilson,

733
00:42:15.711 --> 00:42:18.800
who was the first director of the Fermi national accelerator laboratory.

734
00:42:18.830 --> 00:42:20.930
The first big,
no,
not the first big,

735
00:42:20.931 --> 00:42:24.410
but the biggest accelerator in the world until February until the large Hadron

736
00:42:24.411 --> 00:42:25.244
collider was built.

737
00:42:25.600 --> 00:42:30.270
And in 1960s he was called before Congress and asked the question,
well,

738
00:42:30.271 --> 00:42:34.400
an aid in the defense of the nation and here was his response.
No Sir,

739
00:42:34.401 --> 00:42:35.240
I don't believe so.

740
00:42:35.450 --> 00:42:38.410
It only has to do with the respect with which you regard one another.
DV,

741
00:42:38.490 --> 00:42:42.350
the dignity of men,
our love of culture.
It has to do with are we good painters,

742
00:42:42.351 --> 00:42:43.850
good sculptors,
great poets.

743
00:42:44.180 --> 00:42:47.900
I mean all the things we really venerated in our country and our patriotic
about.

744
00:42:48.200 --> 00:42:52.790
It has nothing to do directly with defending our country except to make it worth

745
00:42:52.791 --> 00:42:53.624
defending.

746
00:42:54.200 --> 00:42:59.200
And that is a beautiful statement and and is particularly poignant today because

747
00:42:59.301 --> 00:43:04.190
we risk getting rid of everything that makes this funky worth defending in an

748
00:43:04.191 --> 00:43:06.130
effort to apparently defend it.

749
00:43:07.940 --> 00:43:12.940
What wakes America great if at anything does is the contributions that will make

750
00:43:13.641 --> 00:43:17.480
and the people in it will make to the legacy,
the future of our children,

751
00:43:18.020 --> 00:43:22.460
the perspectives of the world are understanding the new ideas we develop.

752
00:43:22.760 --> 00:43:24.530
That's why people,
as you can see from here,

753
00:43:24.531 --> 00:43:28.250
that's why people come here from around the world because there's some benefit

754
00:43:28.430 --> 00:43:30.350
because the contributions we make for the future,

755
00:43:30.440 --> 00:43:32.960
if we get rid of all that infrastructure just to defend ourselves,

756
00:43:33.080 --> 00:43:36.920
the greatest story ever told will not continue being great,
at least not here.

757
00:43:37.460 --> 00:43:40.850
And,
and so I want to end with two quotes.
One from the beginning of my book,

758
00:43:40.851 --> 00:43:43.190
which is a famous quote from Virgil.

759
00:43:43.880 --> 00:43:47.630
These are the tiers of things and the stuff of our mortality cuts to the heart.

760
00:43:47.631 --> 00:43:48.820
It's from the beginning.
I needed,

761
00:43:48.840 --> 00:43:53.570
I remember learning that in Latin because I grew up in Canada and I was
educated.

762
00:43:53.990 --> 00:43:58.520
But,
uh,
uh,
the next line,
which is not so well known,

763
00:43:58.810 --> 00:44:02.900
uh,
but I pointed out at the end of the book is release your fear.

764
00:44:03.260 --> 00:44:04.160
And that's the point.

765
00:44:04.910 --> 00:44:09.910
Only if we release our fear of the unknown of others of a universe that may or

766
00:44:10.101 --> 00:44:13.490
may not be the university we like,
only if we're willing to go into the unknown.

767
00:44:13.910 --> 00:44:16.010
Will this greatest story continued to get better?

768
00:44:16.400 --> 00:44:19.640
And we may live in a universe that apparently has no purpose,

769
00:44:19.790 --> 00:44:23.450
apparently isn't designed for us and apparently maybe miserable in the future.

770
00:44:23.960 --> 00:44:26.870
But that's okay because we are fortunate,

771
00:44:27.290 --> 00:44:31.800
more fortunate to have a evolve this consciousness that allows us to ask these

772
00:44:31.801 --> 00:44:34.530
questions for the short time we're here.

773
00:44:34.531 --> 00:44:37.290
And so we should enjoy our brief moment in the sun.
Thank you.

774
00:44:38.360 --> 00:44:43.360
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

775
00:44:47.710 --> 00:44:51.780
<v 2>uh,
so you made an analogy with the arts.
I think the,
the,</v>

776
00:44:51.781 --> 00:44:55.180
the obvious rebuttal there is that it's easy for people,

777
00:44:55.181 --> 00:44:59.080
anybody to see the value in the arts to be,
you know,
it's,

778
00:44:59.081 --> 00:45:02.350
it's sort of directly titillating the senses.
You don't have to be,

779
00:45:02.770 --> 00:45:05.710
you don't have to go on through a music school to appreciate the buck.

780
00:45:06.420 --> 00:45:09.450
<v 0>I don't have to be a scientist to look at the Hubble space telescope picture and</v>

781
00:45:09.451 --> 00:45:12.990
see,
it's amazing.
I mean,
I,
the point is that,
you know what,

782
00:45:13.110 --> 00:45:15.630
if you do go to music school,
you'll appreciate Bach a lot more,

783
00:45:16.290 --> 00:45:18.150
but you can appreciate boxes by listening to it.

784
00:45:18.570 --> 00:45:22.740
But the wonders of the universe are easily appreciated by everyone,

785
00:45:22.741 --> 00:45:27.600
especially children.
We beat it out of them.
Yeah.
The Higgs,

786
00:45:27.601 --> 00:45:31.420
the Higgs Particle for instance.
That's a lot of explaining to get to that.
Yeah,

787
00:45:31.510 --> 00:45:35.860
that's why I wrote a book.
Yeah,
but the point is,
you know,

788
00:45:36.090 --> 00:45:37.770
not everyone has to understand the Higgs particle,

789
00:45:37.771 --> 00:45:39.870
but it's there for those want to get there.

790
00:45:39.871 --> 00:45:42.480
Just like it's there for those who want to pick up a guitar and learn how to

791
00:45:42.481 --> 00:45:45.960
play it.
But you don't have to understand the Higgs park of what you knew.

792
00:45:45.990 --> 00:45:47.220
What really need is you can,

793
00:45:47.910 --> 00:45:51.000
anyone can understand that the basic world around them,

794
00:45:51.001 --> 00:45:53.700
if we provide them the opportunity and more interestingly,

795
00:45:54.210 --> 00:45:57.930
and this is really important if we teach science as it's supposed to be taught,

796
00:45:58.920 --> 00:46:00.330
which is not a bunch of facts.

797
00:46:00.390 --> 00:46:03.810
That's why we live in this world of alternative facts because people in school

798
00:46:03.960 --> 00:46:06.900
are taught that,
you know,
almost all subjects or just a bunch of facts.

799
00:46:07.110 --> 00:46:11.730
Science is a process for discovering facts and that's the process that anyone

800
00:46:11.731 --> 00:46:15.000
can learn it and we and we damn well better start teaching it because,

801
00:46:15.270 --> 00:46:18.300
because of Google in particular when I was growing up,

802
00:46:18.301 --> 00:46:20.700
that was the place to get information.
But because of Google,

803
00:46:20.730 --> 00:46:24.990
I can get more information from this,
but I can get also more in misinformation.

804
00:46:25.860 --> 00:46:30.860
And the only way I can tell the difference is science is skeptical inquiry,

805
00:46:31.710 --> 00:46:35.490
reliance on empirical evidence,
testing my ideas,
checking many sources.

806
00:46:35.700 --> 00:46:40.700
And so that's the thing that really is the greatest legacy of science is that

807
00:46:41.191 --> 00:46:43.650
process.
And that's the thing we need most,

808
00:46:43.860 --> 00:46:48.060
not just for the enjoyment of looking out at a Hubble space telescope picture

809
00:46:48.061 --> 00:46:49.770
and getting a kick out of it.
I mean,

810
00:46:49.771 --> 00:46:54.120
everyone has had Aha experiences when I used to work at science museums when I

811
00:46:54.121 --> 00:46:57.030
was young.
You're like orgasmic.
We call them Aha experience.

812
00:46:57.150 --> 00:47:00.120
When you suddenly see something a new way and it happens to everyone and there's

813
00:47:00.300 --> 00:47:03.120
lots of science that we can do.
But more importantly,

814
00:47:03.300 --> 00:47:05.140
those tools are necessary if you want to,

815
00:47:05.540 --> 00:47:09.720
if we want to have an informed electorate who can actually distinguish policies

816
00:47:09.721 --> 00:47:13.350
that are related to empirical reality from policies that aren't.
So it's,

817
00:47:13.410 --> 00:47:16.590
there's actually a,
an imperative as well as a joy.

818
00:47:16.830 --> 00:47:20.380
But I agree with you that that the,

819
00:47:20.400 --> 00:47:23.280
at least the perception among the public is that you can enjoy music,

820
00:47:23.550 --> 00:47:26.620
art literature with a much lower impedance barriers.

821
00:47:26.640 --> 00:47:30.070
We call it in physics much lower wall.
It seems take a little bit more.

822
00:47:30.460 --> 00:47:33.030
But I do think that's a product of our school systems.
Yeah,

823
00:47:33.130 --> 00:47:36.970
it's definitely worth it.
Trying to,
yeah,
but I mean,
I think if we teach kids,

824
00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:39.220
not answers,
but questions,
how to ask questions,

825
00:47:39.730 --> 00:47:44.560
we're all Hawaii or to want to discover the answers and it's okay to not,
I mean,

826
00:47:44.561 --> 00:47:46.750
the information is irrelevant in the school.

827
00:47:46.870 --> 00:47:50.200
Most of what you learn high schools or you lose sure.
Reading,
writing,
arithmetic.

828
00:47:50.201 --> 00:47:53.020
But beyond that,
most of what you learned as an adult,

829
00:47:53.021 --> 00:47:54.640
it's going to be way beyond what you learned in school.

830
00:47:55.390 --> 00:47:59.350
Most of the physics I do as a scientist,
I learned after my phd.

831
00:48:00.160 --> 00:48:02.890
And so those tools are important,

832
00:48:02.891 --> 00:48:06.550
but the joy is there for everyone at different levels.
And I think we,

833
00:48:06.970 --> 00:48:09.670
what we don't do well enough is tell people,
you know,

834
00:48:10.180 --> 00:48:13.540
it's just amazing how you can enjoy music without being a musician and joy.

835
00:48:13.640 --> 00:48:14.473
You don't have to.

836
00:48:14.500 --> 00:48:18.430
But the common sense view is you cannot enjoy science unless you're a technical

837
00:48:18.431 --> 00:48:20.860
person.
And we have to get over that in my opinion.

838
00:48:21.340 --> 00:48:24.010
I had a small question about your own discussion of Berkeley earlier.

839
00:48:24.880 --> 00:48:28.180
I was wondering what you think about scientists,
um,

840
00:48:28.720 --> 00:48:32.670
kind of believing in the theories they're working on,
uh,
without proof to,

841
00:48:32.680 --> 00:48:35.770
to drive it forward.
They have to,
it's,
I mean,
it,
you know,

842
00:48:36.650 --> 00:48:39.030
science isn't based on faith,
but if you're going to spend 20 years,

843
00:48:39.040 --> 00:48:41.850
your life working on something,
you've got to have a,

844
00:48:43.240 --> 00:48:45.850
I wouldn't call it a belief,
but you'd have to say to yourself that you,

845
00:48:45.910 --> 00:48:49.630
there's some thing tells you it's strongly likely to be true and you can be

846
00:48:49.631 --> 00:48:53.470
completely wrong.
But the great thing that differentiates that from religion,

847
00:48:53.471 --> 00:48:57.910
let's say,
is that if you're a scientist in the end,
if it's shown to be wrong,

848
00:48:58.360 --> 00:49:00.010
you throw it out like yesterday's newspaper.

849
00:49:00.011 --> 00:49:02.890
Even if you spent 20 years your life on it.
That's the difference.

850
00:49:02.891 --> 00:49:07.600
But certainly you cannot work the,
the,
the,
the builders,

851
00:49:07.601 --> 00:49:09.070
the large hadron collider or the developers,

852
00:49:09.071 --> 00:49:11.290
the standard model couldn't have done what they'd done or even the string

853
00:49:11.291 --> 00:49:13.380
theorist.
Now the people that my colleagues are,

854
00:49:13.400 --> 00:49:16.330
do I have students of mine who are well known string theorists,
you know,

855
00:49:16.331 --> 00:49:21.140
so I just wouldn't want my daughter to marry one but,
but um,
but uh,

856
00:49:21.430 --> 00:49:25.510
uh,
but they,
they're,
they have a good reason for doing what they're doing.

857
00:49:25.511 --> 00:49:28.390
And the hope is that the,
somehow the theory will make contact with reality,

858
00:49:28.690 --> 00:49:32.470
but if it won't,
you can be darn sure.
And it's already happening.
In some sense.

859
00:49:32.950 --> 00:49:36.310
You saw when the Higgs was discovered that lots of string theorist went and

860
00:49:37.360 --> 00:49:41.890
jumped ship because suddenly there was new particle physics to look at.
So yeah,

861
00:49:41.910 --> 00:49:44.740
that we all have to have that kind of faith.

862
00:49:44.741 --> 00:49:49.741
But the differences that the faith is not in science is eminently shakable.

863
00:49:50.230 --> 00:49:54.130
The wonderful thing is that it is not iron clad.
And,

864
00:49:54.200 --> 00:49:57.130
and that's supposed to be the great virtue of faith is that you don't give it
up.

865
00:49:57.160 --> 00:50:00.040
But in science,
the great virtue of faith is that it has no,

866
00:50:00.250 --> 00:50:04.690
no utility beyond its utility.
Okay.
Okay.

867
00:50:05.020 --> 00:50:06.850
Good.
Okay.
I guess I'll,
thank you.
