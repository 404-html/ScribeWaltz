00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:07.490
Please welcome.
Dr Rob Silverman

2
00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:16.820
was
better than a,
the one last night,
do you think?

3
00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:21.020
Oh yeah.
Without question.
Genuine.
Yeah.
Much more genuine.
That was good.

4
00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:23.100
That was good.
You know,
I'm happy my mom wrote that for it.

5
00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:28.730
So why don't we just start off,
tell me about why did you get into this field?

6
00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:30.740
You know,
uh,

7
00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:34.220
it's such a great question because there's always a story why some of them

8
00:00:34.221 --> 00:00:38.270
became a doctor.
It's,
it's definitely not for money.
It's,
it's to affect people.

9
00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:39.500
So,
um,

10
00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:44.090
I have congenital torticollis so there's an asymmetry to my head.

11
00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.720
You may notice that.
And,
uh,
I grew up in the Bronx,
so that wasn't fun.

12
00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:52.610
That was,
it was a tough growing up with that.
Um,

13
00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:56.720
and the medical model just didn't have anything to offer me and I'm not so sure

14
00:00:56.721 --> 00:01:01.160
they,
they do at this point either.
And I went to a chiropractor when I was 21.

15
00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:05.000
I had suffered a back injury.
And,
um,
I'll tell you,

16
00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:07.700
the mark twain quote comes to mind every time.

17
00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:10.490
The two most important days of your life are the day you're born.

18
00:01:10.491 --> 00:01:14.180
And the day you knew why he moved my metrics so much,
you know,

19
00:01:14.181 --> 00:01:18.170
and I got up and I knew I wanted to help people,
the way he helped me.

20
00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.950
And concurrently in school,
I had a business degree.
I mean,

21
00:01:21.951 --> 00:01:25.340
like I think we're all wanting to be a chiropractor,
functional nutrition major.

22
00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:29.690
And I was taking nutrition at the time and I was going through diet and it was
a,

23
00:01:29.691 --> 00:01:33.440
it was an elective.
And in that nutrition diet,
a class,

24
00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:36.890
I learned so much about the Diet and I saw such a change going to the gym and

25
00:01:36.891 --> 00:01:41.060
performing in school and even performing on a basketball court that I said,

26
00:01:41.061 --> 00:01:44.720
you know,
there's something here.
So when I graduated college,
uh,

27
00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:46.280
I took all the prerequisites and man,

28
00:01:46.281 --> 00:01:49.760
I went to Cairo school and I've been going forward ever since.
Uh,

29
00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:50.770
just in this room.

30
00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:54.250
Has anyone here raise your hand if you actually have been to a chiropractor?

31
00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:58.270
Okay.
Pretty large amount.
I would say that,
you know,

32
00:01:58.271 --> 00:02:00.460
going to the chiropractor the first time people are like,

33
00:02:00.461 --> 00:02:03.700
what the heck am I getting into?
You must have had that thought yourself.
Oh,

34
00:02:03.701 --> 00:02:07.550
I never heard that one before.
No,
I'm just kidding.
I hear that all the time.
Um,

35
00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:09.740
and chiropractic has grown so much.

36
00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:14.330
It's grown out of the confines and a context of just,
just spinal work.

37
00:02:14.331 --> 00:02:17.840
But we're well beyond that.
I mean,
and I'm living proof of that right here,

38
00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:22.790
that we look at everything from a holistic approach.
And to coin a cute phrase,

39
00:02:22.791 --> 00:02:25.310
we look at the body from the inside out.

40
00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:29.190
So that leads me to my next question because many people might say,

41
00:02:29.191 --> 00:02:32.610
why does it a back doctor here to talk about nutrition and health?

42
00:02:32.611 --> 00:02:36.510
But you actually have a full approach and tell us about that.
Yeah,
I look,

43
00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.770
I look at the body again from the inside out and it was really funny because I

44
00:02:39.771 --> 00:02:41.390
knew nutrition was a key component.

45
00:02:41.391 --> 00:02:46.391
So I'm a believer in manual rehab plus functional nutrition leading to optimum

46
00:02:46.971 --> 00:02:50.720
health.
And I had a really going through chiropractic school,

47
00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:55.010
I had always thought about how do I fix the body from the inside out?

48
00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:59.890
And nutrition was one thing that always resonated as I said with me.

49
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.100
So about 10 years into practice,
I had all these nutrition degrees and um,

50
00:03:04.101 --> 00:03:07.060
I was having some trouble with some patients getting them better and it bothered

51
00:03:07.061 --> 00:03:11.050
me.
So I'm sitting with my six year old niece from Singapore and we're trying to

52
00:03:11.051 --> 00:03:14.290
have an adult conversation.
And of course she's the only adult in the room.

53
00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:15.633
And um,

54
00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:19.990
I basically complaining to her that I can't help somebody and she looks at me

55
00:03:19.991 --> 00:03:24.790
and she says,
you're a doctor,
you're supposed to know.
So I'm like,
and uh,

56
00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:26.950
as opposed to taking it in stride,

57
00:03:26.951 --> 00:03:30.580
I got defensive and I started to make excuses and she just moves a little book

58
00:03:30.581 --> 00:03:34.150
or way.
And she says to me,
you know,
Mommy says,
if you're not good at your job,

59
00:03:34.151 --> 00:03:38.830
get a new one.
So it was a knockout punch.

60
00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:40.660
And then I knew functional nutrition,

61
00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:45.750
looking at the systems are there are only 14 systems in your body.

62
00:03:45.791 --> 00:03:49.150
That's it.
There's thousands of symptoms.

63
00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:54.010
So you had to get to the intrinsic system to really help people.

64
00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:57.070
And that's part of the problem that we have in our healthcare system now.

65
00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:02.080
They're myopic.
And just looking at the symptom.
Why'd you read the book?

66
00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:06.190
You know,
I wrote the book.
Here's,
when I first went to chiropractic school,

67
00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:09.610
I wanted to be,
uh,
help people the way I was helped.
I mean,

68
00:04:09.611 --> 00:04:11.290
that man moved my metrics.

69
00:04:11.291 --> 00:04:13.840
He changed my life and I wanted to change people's lives.

70
00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:18.460
So I became a doctor to do it one on one.
After about 10 years,
I said to myself,

71
00:04:18.461 --> 00:04:18.731
you know,

72
00:04:18.731 --> 00:04:22.420
I want to start lecturing and lecturing to doctors to exponentially reach the

73
00:04:22.421 --> 00:04:26.620
population and that ultimately I wanted to write a book so everybody could

74
00:04:26.621 --> 00:04:31.420
benefit and I could hope to help everybody get good health because health is

75
00:04:31.421 --> 00:04:34.690
wealth.
Well said.
Um,

76
00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:39.460
talk about a little bit more about the issue with the current medical system.

77
00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:43.810
Yeah.
As a referred to,
it's very myopic.
We,
we don't live in a healthcare system.

78
00:04:43.811 --> 00:04:46.960
We live in a sick care system right now,
chronic disease,

79
00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:52.020
which is basically one of the biggest costs on our healthcare system is defined

80
00:04:52.631 --> 00:04:55.780
as something that you have three months or longer that can't be cured by a

81
00:04:55.781 --> 00:04:59.470
vaccine or helped with a drug.
Is that amazing?

82
00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:04.300
So chronic disease refers to cardiovascular disease,
stroke,
arthritis,

83
00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:05.463
depression,

84
00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:10.620
and that's because we're since 1985 we have been led down this road by

85
00:05:10.751 --> 00:05:11.980
pharmaceutical companies.

86
00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:17.010
I call 1985 farm or get in the United States because the US government allowed

87
00:05:17.081 --> 00:05:21.130
pharmaceutical companies to actually advertise to the consumer.

88
00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:24.130
In [inaudible] 97 they said you don't have to list all the side effects.

89
00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:27.400
So that was a very symptom ology move.

90
00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:32.400
We're 4.4% of the population in the world and we use 50% of the forum

91
00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:38.410
pharmaceuticals in 80% of the pain meds.
So there,

92
00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:42.040
you know unfortunately my colleagues look a lot at the symptom and not at the

93
00:05:42.041 --> 00:05:46.570
system and when we start looking at the system and not the symptom,

94
00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:50.620
we are going to start to help people get healthy because chronic disease is

95
00:05:50.621 --> 00:05:53.800
based on symptom system failure.

96
00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:58.720
So the first chapter in your book is something that I think for me it was

97
00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:01.070
something that I had not thought about my gut.

98
00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:06.140
And you focus a lot about the gut being the source of many things.
First of all,

99
00:06:06.141 --> 00:06:10.220
just tell me about what is the gut when we're referring to that,
you know,
um,
it,

100
00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:13.580
it's a great takeaway and that's why I put it in chapter one because do you have

101
00:06:13.581 --> 00:06:16.460
the guts to be healthy?
What have you done for your guts lately?

102
00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:19.880
Did you ever hear the expression gut feeling?
I mean,
we've always known about it,

103
00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:23.240
but we haven't jumped on it.
Our Gut right here,

104
00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:27.890
it protects the inside of the body from the outside of the body.

105
00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:32.690
It's 70% of our immune system is housed in our gut.

106
00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:36.440
It's also where nutrient absorption occurs.

107
00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:41.390
So we have to keep this intrinsic Finn Layer intact.

108
00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:46.690
Otherwise we have all these faulty systems going and we have inflammation auto

109
00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:52.040
immune.
And guess what?
Nobody's really healthy and think of this.

110
00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.440
All the drugs adversely hurt our gut health.

111
00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:00.380
So define the gut for me.
Sure.

112
00:07:00.381 --> 00:07:04.190
Talking about with our gut is basically the surface.

113
00:07:04.191 --> 00:07:08.060
Every few we to unravel it of a tennis court with the thickness of that piece of

114
00:07:08.061 --> 00:07:09.650
paper you have in your hand right there.

115
00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:12.950
If I were to take everybody's guts thickness right now,

116
00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:15.560
I mean it wouldn't literally do it,
but if I were to take it,

117
00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:17.900
it would be the size of the head of a pin.

118
00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:22.840
So the gut actually in when it's in pristine working mortar actually protects it

119
00:07:22.841 --> 00:07:27.200
and absorbs nutrients.
So it's what we call permeable.
However,

120
00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:30.800
through stress,
through food,
through non-steroid anti-inflammatories,

121
00:07:30.801 --> 00:07:35.801
which are like Aleve and Advil and other bad pollutants outside our gut now

122
00:07:38.451 --> 00:07:42.890
becomes permeable.
And these food particles which are supposed to be absorbed,

123
00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:43.783
absorbed,

124
00:07:44.210 --> 00:07:49.210
get exposed to the blood system and all our immune system goes on override and

125
00:07:49.581 --> 00:07:53.270
attacks and we start getting autoimmune.
It raises our level of inflammation.

126
00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:56.420
So the first source,
if you could take anything for Monday,

127
00:07:56.421 --> 00:08:00.650
and I'm a big proponent,
when I lecture Monday morning tomorrow application,

128
00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:04.850
start taking care of your guts.
You talk about a phrase for that.

129
00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:08.330
What is it called?
Uh,
all disease begins in the gut.

130
00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:10.460
Poverty's it's pretty smart guy.

131
00:08:10.610 --> 00:08:14.570
And a leaky gut syndrome is something I had never heard before.
Yeah,

132
00:08:14.571 --> 00:08:17.390
leaky gut is kind of like what I was talking about before.
The Gut.

133
00:08:17.391 --> 00:08:20.150
Should be in a perfect position.
So fiber,
to use an example,

134
00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:23.360
think about your kitchen floor.
I think of all the tiles there in the grout,

135
00:08:23.630 --> 00:08:26.650
so your gut should be in that pristine condition.
In this way,

136
00:08:26.651 --> 00:08:30.620
it can absorb all the nutrients it protects yourself.
Unfortunately through,

137
00:08:30.890 --> 00:08:35.450
once again,
nonsteroidal anti inflammatories Aleve and Advil and bad bacteria.

138
00:08:35.690 --> 00:08:40.400
What happens is the grout gets taken out,
it opens up and things pass through.

139
00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:43.100
So a very important thing is we've got a lot of bugs down here.

140
00:08:43.101 --> 00:08:45.110
We call the bacteria.
There's good and bad bugs.

141
00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:49.010
Most Americans have too many bad bugs and not enough good bucks.

142
00:08:49.190 --> 00:08:53.930
So that's why we always recommend a good probiotic.
Probiotic,
pro life,

143
00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:58.110
good bacteria,
good.
By the way,
don't get nervous about bacteria.

144
00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:02.520
It out.
Numbers you tend to want the guy talking to in the street probably wasn't

145
00:09:02.521 --> 00:09:03.020
talking to you.

146
00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:05.640
It was probably talking to his bacteria because it's live and that's his best

147
00:09:05.641 --> 00:09:10.080
friend right now.
Tell me about inflammation.
What is it?
It's a phrase.

148
00:09:10.081 --> 00:09:13.110
It's a term thrown around all the time.
It happens when I bumped my knee.

149
00:09:13.170 --> 00:09:15.990
It happens when I drink too much.
What is inflammation?

150
00:09:16.350 --> 00:09:19.530
Inflammation is the body's response to a foreign object coming in.

151
00:09:19.531 --> 00:09:24.531
So when you've got sir leaky and certain digested or undigested particles come

152
00:09:24.601 --> 00:09:27.090
through,
your immune system goes on overdrive.

153
00:09:27.091 --> 00:09:29.160
So inflammation means to be set a fire.

154
00:09:29.310 --> 00:09:32.130
The biggest problem that we have is please don't be upset,

155
00:09:32.131 --> 00:09:33.990
but everybody in this room is probably inflamed.

156
00:09:35.530 --> 00:09:40.230
So inflammation is the body's response to something that shouldn't be there.

157
00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:44.970
And it leads us down the road for CVD,
obesity,
arthritis,

158
00:09:45.030 --> 00:09:47.220
and for such a young crowd,
early agent.

159
00:09:48.030 --> 00:09:53.030
So typically we treat inflammation with certain drugs and we'll get to that in a

160
00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:58.360
minute.
But,
um,
you have a different approach.
Absolutely.
I mean,
uh,

161
00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:01.490
you know,
the drugs that I like to pick on,
if you will,
if I may are,

162
00:10:02.010 --> 00:10:06.270
as I said earlier,
nonsteroidal anti inflammatories,
uh,
they are Aleve,
Advil,

163
00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:10.860
Ibuprofen,
nonsteroidal antiinflammatories do decrease pain,

164
00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:15.780
but they impair healing.
Nutriceuticals decreased pain,

165
00:10:15.781 --> 00:10:18.270
but promote healing.
Which do you want?

166
00:10:18.570 --> 00:10:23.280
Nonsteroidal antiinflammatories don't allow for muscles to heal,
part ledge,

167
00:10:23.281 --> 00:10:27.450
to heal bone to heal.
And they also cause leaky gut.

168
00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:29.670
And you know how easy it is to get one of those.
I mean,

169
00:10:29.671 --> 00:10:33.870
I travel all the time and when I come to a hotel,
10 11 o'clock at night,

170
00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:37.590
and if I were to say,
if I had a headache,
guess what they offer me?

171
00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:42.660
It's a feeling question.
Tell me what do you think they offer me and sets.

172
00:10:43.170 --> 00:10:46.680
No one offers me a probiotic.
Nobody offers me a fish oil.

173
00:10:47.370 --> 00:10:50.190
Nobody offers me up.
Delight,
delicious,
green drink,
you know,

174
00:10:50.191 --> 00:10:52.650
fiber or no fiber in it.
So the problem,

175
00:10:52.830 --> 00:10:57.780
do they work as well or as quick?
We don't,
they don't work quite as quick,

176
00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:00.270
but they work well without any side effects.

177
00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:03.540
And that's why the American module wants these insights because it's fast,

178
00:11:03.541 --> 00:11:04.890
it's quick and they don't understand.

179
00:11:04.891 --> 00:11:08.760
So if I were to quiz everybody here or survey them,
they would not realize that.

180
00:11:08.761 --> 00:11:12.900
And sats provide no healing.
And so that's referring to Tylenol or Advil,

181
00:11:12.901 --> 00:11:16.410
Ibuprofen and things like that.
Yeah,
absolutely.
So,
uh,

182
00:11:16.710 --> 00:11:20.280
do you have any examples of maybe a patient or something with this inflammation

183
00:11:20.281 --> 00:11:24.480
if issue that you were able to kind of successfully treat?
Yeah,
I'm have many,

184
00:11:24.481 --> 00:11:29.010
but one really comes to mind.
We'll call her Gail.
And uh,
in her teenage years,

185
00:11:29.011 --> 00:11:31.680
she got,
um,
a Lyme disease.

186
00:11:31.710 --> 00:11:36.060
So she got a plethora of antibiotics.
He was gouged with them.

187
00:11:36.061 --> 00:11:39.630
She also did not realize at the time she also had a gluten problem,

188
00:11:39.690 --> 00:11:44.010
gluten being got a glue sticking to the intestinal track.

189
00:11:44.310 --> 00:11:47.910
And then she had multiple other conditions into more antibiotics.

190
00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:52.590
So her gut became compromised so much.
So she had a failed marriage.

191
00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:56.590
She had to quit a job because she had to go to the laboratory too many times and

192
00:11:56.591 --> 00:11:58.960
was embarrassed.
And she basically,

193
00:11:58.961 --> 00:12:02.770
when she came in and early third is beautiful young girl was in a really bad
way.

194
00:12:02.950 --> 00:12:06.010
So we put it through a specific gut restoration program,

195
00:12:06.190 --> 00:12:10.450
took her off gluten and within six weeks she lost the needed wait.

196
00:12:10.570 --> 00:12:15.570
She felt better and she had a job afterwards so it can be done naturally.

197
00:12:16.780 --> 00:12:18.190
And I proport to everybody here,

198
00:12:18.191 --> 00:12:22.660
start considering that the doctor of the 21st century looks for nonsurgical,

199
00:12:22.661 --> 00:12:27.100
non drug approaches.
Um,
little off topic,
but you mentioned gluten.

200
00:12:27.101 --> 00:12:29.170
Is it the enemy that we all see it?

201
00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:32.590
It is absolutely anime literature came out just last week,

202
00:12:32.591 --> 00:12:36.010
so obviously it wasn't able to get it in a book that whether you have celiac

203
00:12:36.011 --> 00:12:39.760
disease are not 100% of people have issues with gluten.

204
00:12:39.820 --> 00:12:43.690
It means glue in Latin.
It sticks.
It's a piece,
the residue.

205
00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:47.260
But it's so good.
I know,
but you know what Jacqueline said about it.

206
00:12:47.261 --> 00:12:51.400
If man makes it,
I won't eat it.
So it can't be good if God gives a go for it.

207
00:12:52.060 --> 00:12:53.100
You say that,
uh,

208
00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:58.180
you also have said to me if it's in a package or the can try to stay away from

209
00:12:58.421 --> 00:13:00.610
it is that,
you know,
it goes back a,
again,

210
00:13:00.611 --> 00:13:03.790
I get to work with a lot of patients and I have my patient come in and says,

211
00:13:03.791 --> 00:13:06.680
you know what?
If it has a food label,
it just forget it.
And,

212
00:13:06.681 --> 00:13:10.660
and the person's right because it's man made.
So the labels can be very,

213
00:13:10.661 --> 00:13:14.710
very misleading.
So let's buy foods without labels.
Let's buy whole foods.

214
00:13:14.711 --> 00:13:18.880
Let's buy real foods.
Let's buy organic foods.
I'm in this room,
show hands.

215
00:13:18.881 --> 00:13:23.170
Anybody that's tried to dye it in the last six months.
Okay.
Uh,

216
00:13:23.710 --> 00:13:24.640
you're not a fan.

217
00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:29.920
Diets don't work as evidenced by the fact that 40% of males in America are

218
00:13:29.921 --> 00:13:32.110
obese.
35% of women are obese.

219
00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:37.320
15% of men worldwide are obese and only 11% of women worldwide or will be,

220
00:13:37.351 --> 00:13:41.740
so we're too heavy.
Diets don't work.
They're a jail term.
It doesn't work.

221
00:13:41.741 --> 00:13:44.770
Therapeutic lifestyle where you adhere to healthy food,

222
00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:49.720
exercise and proper supplementation is the way to go for long lasting weight

223
00:13:49.721 --> 00:13:52.300
loss.
Body composition in overall health.

224
00:13:52.330 --> 00:13:56.650
So we look at a diet generally is a short term thing.

225
00:13:56.680 --> 00:13:59.860
You're saying you should just change your overall lifestyle.

226
00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:04.690
Lifestyle without question.
Uh,
you know,
we,
this is very common.

227
00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:08.020
You go on vacation,
you come back,
what do you,
diet starts on Monday,
you know,

228
00:14:08.021 --> 00:14:10.150
and then you,
you do the cleanse or whatever.

229
00:14:10.151 --> 00:14:14.470
You have said detox and cleanses are very different.
Um,

230
00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:19.210
can you just tell me briefly the importance of detoxing?
Well,

231
00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:21.940
detox is not a cleanse in a cleanse is not a detox.

232
00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.730
Basically a cleanse is something you can go up the road and they give you

233
00:14:24.731 --> 00:14:27.310
something and you go to the bathroom real quick.
It's not working.

234
00:14:28.090 --> 00:14:32.560
Detox is something that's intrinsic in that you're trying to detox your liver,

235
00:14:32.590 --> 00:14:33.610
which is in Oregon.

236
00:14:34.090 --> 00:14:38.410
Work through specific hormones were full of toxins.
Every one of us,

237
00:14:38.411 --> 00:14:42.430
this is New York City,
am I correct?
We all walk to get in here,

238
00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:44.770
so we will all expose to secondary smoke.

239
00:14:44.771 --> 00:14:48.610
We were exposed to smoke from the chimneys were exposed to pollution in the air,

240
00:14:48.611 --> 00:14:52.790
was sitting in a a room where they used lead in,
in the paint.

241
00:14:53.540 --> 00:14:56.180
Anybody use any health care products today?
I use nine.

242
00:14:56.390 --> 00:14:59.000
I was the average American,
the average American news,

243
00:14:59.001 --> 00:15:02.810
nine healthcare products that exposed me to 123 chemicals,

244
00:15:03.050 --> 00:15:06.800
which got absorbed in my bloodstream within 26 seconds.
But having,

245
00:15:06.801 --> 00:15:08.720
they've been tested really?

246
00:15:11.350 --> 00:15:13.400
I got a bridge.
It's not too far down the road.

247
00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:16.370
And now what's your thought on that?
Well,
for me,
you know,

248
00:15:16.371 --> 00:15:20.150
one of the things I would do is I would definitely use organic chemical free

249
00:15:20.660 --> 00:15:25.250
products.
I would reduce the ability to be exposed and I would detox.

250
00:15:25.340 --> 00:15:27.560
So I'm a big proponent of a 10 day detox.

251
00:15:27.830 --> 00:15:32.360
Any kind of medical food that has specific nutrients that is enabling your liver

252
00:15:32.361 --> 00:15:35.690
to break down toxins and pass them out through the body.

253
00:15:35.810 --> 00:15:37.700
That's a key component to overall health.

254
00:15:37.701 --> 00:15:40.220
Anybody know anybody that's got rings under their eyes?

255
00:15:40.490 --> 00:15:44.660
Anybody know anybody who's tired,
little upset about their hair,
he need to detox.

256
00:15:44.690 --> 00:15:48.710
It's toxic overload.
You can't be a clean fish and the dirty ball,

257
00:15:49.670 --> 00:15:52.250
uh,
you explain quite welcomed me the other day,

258
00:15:52.251 --> 00:15:56.300
the what's happening in your liver and that sometimes you know,
you're,
you're,

259
00:15:56.330 --> 00:15:57.920
there's two parts.
There's what goes in,

260
00:15:57.921 --> 00:16:02.000
there's what goes out and it needs to keep us a solid flow.

261
00:16:02.001 --> 00:16:03.770
Can you tell me about that?
Absolutely.

262
00:16:03.771 --> 00:16:08.450
So I guess you guys are ready for me to get a little technical.
You guys ready?

263
00:16:08.890 --> 00:16:10.930
And if,
yeah,
you please feel free to raise question your,

264
00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:13.940
raise your hands and ask questions.
Absolute take some questions at the end too.

265
00:16:13.941 --> 00:16:18.140
But,
so I'm going to get just a little technical.
Toxins are fat soluble.

266
00:16:18.470 --> 00:16:22.280
They need to get broken down in the liver to what we call water soluble toxins.

267
00:16:22.310 --> 00:16:25.310
The problem in most America is since the liver split in half,

268
00:16:25.311 --> 00:16:29.780
it's called two phases.
Phase one is too quick and phase two is too slow.

269
00:16:30.020 --> 00:16:33.020
Phase one a spot up by people who drink coffee.
By the way,

270
00:16:33.021 --> 00:16:37.670
if you want to talk about a toxin,
let's talk about some coffee here.

271
00:16:38.060 --> 00:16:40.070
Anybody go to Starbucks?
You've got your own.
I noticed that,

272
00:16:40.071 --> 00:16:41.840
but it was with a cure.
I don't tell any of us.

273
00:16:42.140 --> 00:16:47.140
I know coffee is the most drunk consumed beverage in America and it's the third

274
00:16:48.111 --> 00:16:50.720
most sprayed crop,
so you need organic coffee.

275
00:16:50.721 --> 00:16:54.890
Coffee speeds up the first part of the liver to make it move too quick so you're

276
00:16:54.891 --> 00:16:59.891
not able to break down these toxins to begin the get dispensed with to leave,

277
00:16:59.961 --> 00:17:03.260
deliver,
and go to the kidney and go get pooped out.
By the way,

278
00:17:03.470 --> 00:17:08.470
do you know one of the major pathways of the liver is to detox estrogen?

279
00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:10.760
Ladies,
if I may,

280
00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:15.020
the number one toxin that women are exposed to our tampons,

281
00:17:16.430 --> 00:17:20.570
they made a cotton,
the number one sprayed item.
Did I just lose the crowd?

282
00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:24.620
Everybody's looking at it wasn't me.
Don't kill the Messenger.

283
00:17:24.830 --> 00:17:27.950
The number one sprayed item is cotton,

284
00:17:28.150 --> 00:17:32.270
94% of tampons or cotton and they had the applicator.
It's toxic.

285
00:17:32.690 --> 00:17:36.020
So
first of all,
you mentioned coffee.

286
00:17:36.021 --> 00:17:40.430
I mean that's something we all drink.
Organic coffee is relatively okay,

287
00:17:40.431 --> 00:17:42.140
I'm in organic coffee.
But again,

288
00:17:42.141 --> 00:17:45.500
you don't want it in a cure act cause if it's in the Kurek it's got the plastic

289
00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:50.680
because anything with plastic has BPA and bps to decrease testosterone in men.

290
00:17:51.721 --> 00:17:55.500
BPA is also shown to have preterm births in women.

291
00:17:55.650 --> 00:17:57.600
BPA is poison and by the way,

292
00:17:58.680 --> 00:18:01.170
our currency or dollars have BPA in it.

293
00:18:01.530 --> 00:18:06.390
And so do our cash registers receipts.
So we are always exposed.

294
00:18:06.450 --> 00:18:10.260
We own almost need a detox both the spring and fall cleaning.

295
00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:14.250
So I don't want to dive too much into detoxing,
but I,
you know,

296
00:18:14.251 --> 00:18:16.920
I think it's incredibly important and if you guys pick up the book,

297
00:18:16.921 --> 00:18:19.460
there is quite a few examples of,

298
00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:24.450
of solid ways to really pun intended,
to really detox yourself.
Right?

299
00:18:24.540 --> 00:18:28.740
Um,
so I want to kind of skip a little bit more forward.
Um,

300
00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:34.500
you talk about,
uh,
a sprained ankle being one of the most common injuries.

301
00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:39.450
Um,
what are we doing wrong in the way that we treat our musculoskeletal system?

302
00:18:39.750 --> 00:18:43.140
Well,
here's your takeaway in your musculoskeletal system.
Number one,

303
00:18:43.290 --> 00:18:46.380
how many of you people have injured your musculoskeletal system and waited to

304
00:18:46.381 --> 00:18:50.800
see if it would go away and heal?
How did it work?
Not so hot,
right?

305
00:18:50.820 --> 00:18:51.750
Cause if it worked,

306
00:18:51.990 --> 00:18:55.560
older people in Caveman would have stood straighter and musculoskeletal system,

307
00:18:55.650 --> 00:19:00.510
which attaches and affects every other system in a body is a unique system in

308
00:19:00.511 --> 00:19:04.800
that it needs some stuff sort of stimuli.
Our bodies,
a beautiful organism.

309
00:19:04.980 --> 00:19:07.380
It has the ability to heal itself.

310
00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:11.640
The problem is it just needs a little help and it needs certain nutrients and

311
00:19:11.641 --> 00:19:15.720
certain exercises.
So typically I have a patient comment after an injury,

312
00:19:15.721 --> 00:19:18.660
like three or four weeks,
and I say,
uh,
why'd you wait so long?
Well,

313
00:19:18.661 --> 00:19:21.420
I want to see if it went away.
Where did it go?
North,
south,
east or west?

314
00:19:21.450 --> 00:19:24.420
Where's it going?
Does it didn't have a passport?
I mean,
where is it going?

315
00:19:24.870 --> 00:19:28.980
And the fact is you all have to know that a musculoskeletal injury does not heal

316
00:19:28.981 --> 00:19:33.570
on its own.
And you have to tend to it with exercise,
nutrition and diet.

317
00:19:33.571 --> 00:19:38.571
Because in injured tissue needs specific nutrients to enable itself to heal.

318
00:19:39.420 --> 00:19:41.010
To speak to the sprained ankle,

319
00:19:41.130 --> 00:19:45.000
it is the most recurrent injury that we have in sports.

320
00:19:45.001 --> 00:19:49.470
80% Reoccurrence.
It's not just a sprained ankle because,
oh,
it's just a sprain.

321
00:19:49.471 --> 00:19:54.270
Tape it up.
But it's not because the current mantra is price pressure,

322
00:19:54.271 --> 00:19:57.990
rice,
ice,
compression,
elevation.
But if that were to be working,

323
00:19:58.020 --> 00:20:00.030
it wouldn't be the most recurrent injury.

324
00:20:00.180 --> 00:20:03.990
So you have to understand that the body's all interconnected.

325
00:20:04.290 --> 00:20:07.500
It's as great working organism.
It's so exciting,

326
00:20:07.740 --> 00:20:11.190
but the bodies and continue connected.
So if you sprained a ligament,

327
00:20:11.220 --> 00:20:13.920
that's what a sprained ankle is.
You've also injured a muscle.

328
00:20:13.950 --> 00:20:18.930
You've injured other structures up above the area of the ankle.

329
00:20:19.170 --> 00:20:23.640
Get it checked.
So when you go to the doctor today,

330
00:20:23.790 --> 00:20:27.780
take some Advil,
stay off it.
Is this,
did you say that?

331
00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:31.480
Did he just say Advil guys?
I mean,
what do you,
what do you do?

332
00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:35.580
What's the better way?
Oh,
well for me simply of course,
seek somebody out.

333
00:20:35.581 --> 00:20:38.460
I'm not going to tell you just to see a chiropractic on a taxi chiropractor.

334
00:20:38.850 --> 00:20:40.130
Nevertheless,
um,

335
00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:44.070
what you want to do is you want to get an immediate treatment protocols.

336
00:20:44.071 --> 00:20:46.110
Some of the things you want to look at are proteolytic.

337
00:20:46.111 --> 00:20:49.750
Enzymes are a much better choice than the end PSATs.
Proteolytic enzymes,

338
00:20:49.810 --> 00:20:52.330
bromelain,
trypsin and Chymotrypsin.

339
00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:55.690
They've natural support to decrease swelling.

340
00:20:55.840 --> 00:20:57.460
There's other items like tumor,

341
00:20:57.520 --> 00:21:00.760
everybody's heard of that curcumin is in tumeric not to get it again,

342
00:21:00.761 --> 00:21:01.451
too technical.

343
00:21:01.451 --> 00:21:06.451
These natural herbs that have been shown to help heal the body at a cellular

344
00:21:06.671 --> 00:21:10.630
level without the side effects,
these end sides do.
And of course,

345
00:21:10.870 --> 00:21:15.160
get your treatment,
get active treatment.
It doesn't go away.

346
00:21:16.150 --> 00:21:21.150
So you actually mentioned in the book that you got to kind of move around a

347
00:21:22.181 --> 00:21:23.770
little bit on it,
right?
You have to,

348
00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:28.330
because otherwise it'll get used to the wrong kind of set,
right?

349
00:21:28.331 --> 00:21:32.380
It's altered motor control and basically your brain is your big chip.
Hey,

350
00:21:32.381 --> 00:21:34.780
we're here at Google,
right?
So you all know how computers work.

351
00:21:34.781 --> 00:21:38.020
The brain is the chip.
So when you're spraying your ankle,
you walked funny,
right?

352
00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:43.030
So when it heals the walk better or did your body feel your brain take a new

353
00:21:43.031 --> 00:21:44.530
motion in movement?

354
00:21:45.310 --> 00:21:48.600
So you have to do something called proprioception and rebalance your nervous

355
00:21:48.601 --> 00:21:51.850
system with your muscular system.
So standing on one leg,

356
00:21:52.210 --> 00:21:54.130
standing on a little unstable surface,

357
00:21:54.340 --> 00:21:58.300
and that will give you a panacea of outcomes that you'll love.

358
00:21:58.570 --> 00:22:01.750
Movement is a great thing that you brought up.
I mean,
by the way,

359
00:22:01.751 --> 00:22:05.590
everybody here is sitting,
sitting is the new smoking.
Sorry about that.

360
00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:08.590
So Reebok did a study.
I'm allowed to say that here.
Well,

361
00:22:08.591 --> 00:22:13.591
Reebok did a study that we live about 26,000 days and in that we exercise 0.7%

362
00:22:15.431 --> 00:22:19.150
of our time.
Yes.
Sit almost 30 and you play with technology.

363
00:22:19.210 --> 00:22:22.540
This may not be news to you 41% of the time.

364
00:22:22.750 --> 00:22:25.270
So do me a favor before I leave,

365
00:22:25.300 --> 00:22:28.450
everybody's going to stand up because at least I know you'll be healthier.

366
00:22:28.451 --> 00:22:30.040
And then you got something from this talk.

367
00:22:30.280 --> 00:22:35.050
So fitbit is a minimum generally of your 10,000 steps,

368
00:22:35.051 --> 00:22:38.230
right?
Does that,
well,
I like the 10,000 step,

369
00:22:38.231 --> 00:22:41.560
but the fitbit just got shown not to work because the people who use the fitbit

370
00:22:41.561 --> 00:22:43.960
didn't work out as hard,
interestingly enough.

371
00:22:43.990 --> 00:22:48.700
So don't use the fitbit but get moving.
If I could tell you anything,
exercise,

372
00:22:48.701 --> 00:22:50.260
move 10,000 steps.
Mike,

373
00:22:50.470 --> 00:22:54.910
what a great start to the day standing desks.
Is it something that helps?

374
00:22:54.911 --> 00:22:56.590
Standing desks are a great choice.

375
00:22:56.591 --> 00:22:59.590
Standing desks as something that I purport to have a habit in my office.

376
00:22:59.591 --> 00:23:02.390
If you ever guys go to my youtube,
my social media thing,

377
00:23:02.420 --> 00:23:05.860
you'll see that I'm standing,
I'm standing all the time.
You know,

378
00:23:05.861 --> 00:23:10.580
I look great for 95.
Right.
So,
uh,

379
00:23:10.750 --> 00:23:14.680
switching gears a little bit,
um,
we have a whole chapter about lasers.
Okay.

380
00:23:14.681 --> 00:23:17.620
So I would have to say that many skeptics,

381
00:23:17.621 --> 00:23:19.390
including myself before even reading this,

382
00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:23.080
I always see lasers as like a quick cheap fix.
You know,

383
00:23:23.081 --> 00:23:25.510
it's going to grow your hair back and do all these crazy things.

384
00:23:25.511 --> 00:23:29.380
But you actually advocate for laser therapy.
Is this correct?
I do.

385
00:23:29.381 --> 00:23:33.490
I'm a big promoter.
It's not just a laser like in the movie,

386
00:23:33.491 --> 00:23:37.450
Austin Powers Laser is actually based on Einstein's Laura physics.

387
00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:42.250
So when you really understand it,
it's basically working at a cellular level.

388
00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:47.280
It's got a light that penetrates the skin and the cell membrane to stimulate

389
00:23:47.601 --> 00:23:50.540
healing at a cell level.
And if we don't think that light is healing,

390
00:23:50.541 --> 00:23:53.840
did anybody ever see a child that was born with Billy Reuben?
You know,
yellow?

391
00:23:54.080 --> 00:23:57.770
What does everybody do?
They put it into the window and the light.

392
00:23:58.010 --> 00:24:02.780
So this is mimicking the sunlight to allow for healing from a guest.
What?

393
00:24:03.020 --> 00:24:06.440
From the inside out.
So,
um,

394
00:24:07.980 --> 00:24:11.780
a couple of quick things now.
Uh,
switching from lasers,

395
00:24:12.260 --> 00:24:15.620
concussions,
the same thing that you actually write about also in the book.

396
00:24:15.650 --> 00:24:19.160
That's,
you know,
I think kind of interesting.
It's certainly on the rise.

397
00:24:19.161 --> 00:24:21.080
Tell me about the epidemic anyway.

398
00:24:21.290 --> 00:24:25.940
Concussion is probably the most topical conversation we can have,
but you know,

399
00:24:25.941 --> 00:24:26.774
it's interesting.

400
00:24:26.840 --> 00:24:31.280
I'm going to ask the crowd what sport has the most concussions?

401
00:24:32.030 --> 00:24:35.810
Soccer.
It's number three.
Good guests.
Football number two.

402
00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:41.310
Number one,
cycling.
Now cycling's number one.
Wow.

403
00:24:41.550 --> 00:24:46.370
Football's number two.
What do they both wear?
Helmets,

404
00:24:46.490 --> 00:24:48.350
right?
So what does that tell you?

405
00:24:48.590 --> 00:24:50.720
The helmet is there so they don't crack their skull.

406
00:24:50.900 --> 00:24:55.400
So let's understand what's going on because it's rampid concussions it.

407
00:24:55.430 --> 00:24:58.790
Your brain is three pounds.
It's small.

408
00:24:59.150 --> 00:25:02.300
It's three pounds of jelly hold by one septum.

409
00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:06.680
So it's not the initial impact you.
So if I go like this,
it's not the impact.

410
00:25:06.890 --> 00:25:10.010
It's the whip.
And when you whip your head,

411
00:25:10.280 --> 00:25:12.380
you stretch your brain tissue.

412
00:25:12.590 --> 00:25:17.360
They're showing that people are stretching this gelatin the substance up to 50%

413
00:25:17.510 --> 00:25:21.140
so if you may remember the Jello your mom gave you spread it apart,

414
00:25:21.141 --> 00:25:26.141
50% that's where that brain injury occurs in the problem that we have is that

415
00:25:27.261 --> 00:25:30.440
90% of people have a concussion,
do not lose consciousness.

416
00:25:30.890 --> 00:25:34.250
So people don't think they have a concussion.
Concussion is running rapid.

417
00:25:34.251 --> 00:25:38.030
It's on the rise.
Most common,
believe it or not in females.

418
00:25:38.270 --> 00:25:41.690
And the reason real simply is women have a tendency to report injury quicker.

419
00:25:42.110 --> 00:25:45.830
Number two,
women's next aren't as strong as men.
And they whipped her head back.

420
00:25:45.860 --> 00:25:49.550
And number three,
they have something called the withdrawal hypotheses.

421
00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:53.090
Women have estrogen and then progesterone during their normal cycle.

422
00:25:53.300 --> 00:25:57.230
So progesterone in the last two weeks is typically high.
It has a calming,

423
00:25:57.350 --> 00:26:01.610
healing effect on the brain.
The moment the woman gets hit,

424
00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:04.520
the pituitary gland struts to purchase,
thrown off.

425
00:26:04.670 --> 00:26:09.670
They have no hormonal response and they are more susceptible to concussions than

426
00:26:09.681 --> 00:26:10.514
men.

427
00:26:11.090 --> 00:26:14.720
So you advocate for a different type,

428
00:26:14.840 --> 00:26:19.430
a different approach to treating concussion.
Absolutely.
So what you know,

429
00:26:19.431 --> 00:26:21.850
there's a lot of people out there saying that the cure and concussions,

430
00:26:21.851 --> 00:26:23.600
so here's what I would recommend.
Number one,

431
00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:27.980
low level laser has shown to be efficacious to help with traumatic brain injury,

432
00:26:27.981 --> 00:26:31.910
which is a concussion.
Seek somebody out who's got a six 35 not or Meta laser.

433
00:26:31.911 --> 00:26:35.570
It's great.
Nutrition.
Nutrition is fabulous.

434
00:26:35.571 --> 00:26:38.240
So let's talk about a few nutrients you would like eat some protein.

435
00:26:38.540 --> 00:26:42.680
Protein gives an immediate response creating it gives immediate energy to the

436
00:26:42.681 --> 00:26:46.020
brain.
I would do would you alpha lipoic acid,

437
00:26:46.021 --> 00:26:50.580
which is a great anti oxen and Coleen Vitamin D,
zinc.

438
00:26:50.670 --> 00:26:52.710
And here's the big takeaway.
Glutathione.

439
00:26:52.980 --> 00:26:57.600
Glutathione is the body's biggest intracellular antioxidant.
Two years ago,

440
00:26:57.870 --> 00:26:59.550
sports illustrated did a study.

441
00:26:59.551 --> 00:27:02.550
They had a graduate assistant who take the skull off mice,
by the way,

442
00:27:02.551 --> 00:27:05.040
do me a favor,
whether you like to talk or not,

443
00:27:05.220 --> 00:27:08.640
don't ever vote for me to come back as a Ronan cause they beat the bejesus out

444
00:27:08.641 --> 00:27:09.960
of these guys in labs.

445
00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:14.400
So they took the skull off and they found out that this guy was giving everybody

446
00:27:14.401 --> 00:27:15.120
a concussion.

447
00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:19.650
They went over to him that the mice that is and they put in glutathione and it

448
00:27:19.651 --> 00:27:24.651
decreased brain tissue damage by 70% so there's a lot of nutrition and nutrients

449
00:27:26.730 --> 00:27:30.450
to help brain tissue.
He'll get on that.

450
00:27:30.451 --> 00:27:32.370
And here's the biggest takeaway,
Mike.

451
00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:36.420
When you injure your brain injury,
your gut,

452
00:27:36.870 --> 00:27:40.680
it takes six hours after a concussion to have damage to brain.

453
00:27:41.280 --> 00:27:45.270
Your gut becomes leaky.
Six hours.
So remember,

454
00:27:45.450 --> 00:27:50.340
brain on fire means gut on fire.
Gut on fire means brain on fire.

455
00:27:50.520 --> 00:27:54.090
They're intertwined.
So remember when I said before,
if you had leaky gut,

456
00:27:54.300 --> 00:27:57.270
you're more susceptible to a brain injury.
If you damage your brain,

457
00:27:57.271 --> 00:27:59.100
you're more susceptible to a leaky gut.

458
00:27:59.310 --> 00:28:02.160
So it's not just a concussion and it's not just resting,

459
00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:06.450
it's fixing the systems and the body from the inside out and nothing shows it

460
00:28:06.451 --> 00:28:07.590
better than concussion.

461
00:28:08.310 --> 00:28:12.360
So I want to start encouraging people to think if they have any questions to you

462
00:28:12.361 --> 00:28:15.150
know,
come forward.
We'll have some time for that.

463
00:28:15.151 --> 00:28:19.140
But I want to talk now back to the gut.
Um,
bloating.

464
00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:22.400
We talked about it about a little earlier.
Inflammation.
Uh,

465
00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:24.480
you have the six R's.

466
00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:28.650
That was like really interesting if you could kind of walk.
Sure.

467
00:28:28.770 --> 00:28:30.570
So what Michael's referring to,

468
00:28:30.571 --> 00:28:35.571
we spoken before about bloating is the gut has no pain fibers.

469
00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:38.580
So you can't tell if something like gluten is bothering you.

470
00:28:39.420 --> 00:28:43.010
So do you get gas and bloating when you eat?
Jenny are friends,
gay,

471
00:28:43.011 --> 00:28:46.380
gas and bloating.
You have a gut compromise.
If you get a brain fog afterwards,

472
00:28:46.710 --> 00:28:50.520
it means that your brain membranes are compromised.
Think about that.

473
00:28:50.521 --> 00:28:52.770
It's not after lunch,
which you guys haven't eaten yet,

474
00:28:53.640 --> 00:28:56.940
that it's shipped to feign or anything like that.
If you're like lagging,

475
00:28:57.720 --> 00:28:59.190
there's something wrong with the membrane.

476
00:28:59.340 --> 00:29:03.450
The six our program is a program that I designed to enable ourselves to fix the

477
00:29:03.451 --> 00:29:08.100
gut and fix the brain.
Basically the RSR,
an acronym for we have to remove.

478
00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:09.210
So what are we going to remove?

479
00:29:09.211 --> 00:29:11.610
Are you going to take all the things that you're eating that cause a problem

480
00:29:11.611 --> 00:29:13.770
like gluten and things of that nature?

481
00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:17.370
You're also going to use specific nutrients to remove the bacteria.

482
00:29:17.550 --> 00:29:21.120
So when you eat gluten,
it's like your body's on fire.

483
00:29:21.660 --> 00:29:25.980
So if you stop,
all you did was called a fireman.
They'll houses down,

484
00:29:25.981 --> 00:29:27.090
but there's no more fire.

485
00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:30.710
So now you need to start to rebuild it and call the contract.

486
00:29:30.711 --> 00:29:32.550
You don't call the firemen the next day.

487
00:29:32.790 --> 00:29:36.420
So what you want to do is you want to replace with digestive enzymes and

488
00:29:36.421 --> 00:29:39.030
pancreatic enzymes.
You want to reinoculate.

489
00:29:39.031 --> 00:29:41.590
That's the third are with pro probiotics.

490
00:29:41.740 --> 00:29:45.730
You want to repair and regenerate the gut lining with specific nutrients,

491
00:29:45.850 --> 00:29:50.380
and then the doctors should retest you to make sure you've reached clinical

492
00:29:50.381 --> 00:29:54.260
outcome.
And if you have,
great,
let's retain your health.
Because what,

493
00:29:54.310 --> 00:29:56.560
like I said before,
health is wealth.

494
00:29:57.100 --> 00:30:01.960
All disease begins in the gut.
So probiotics,

495
00:30:01.961 --> 00:30:06.820
all these things are great.
New Supplements,
uh,
men and women are very different.

496
00:30:06.970 --> 00:30:11.740
Right?
So,
uh,
you just noticed that.
Yeah,
that's what I would talk later about.

497
00:30:13.300 --> 00:30:15.700
Uh,
tell me.
So,
um,

498
00:30:15.701 --> 00:30:19.670
especially when it comes to bone density and things like that,
what,

499
00:30:19.720 --> 00:30:24.670
what should maybe women be doing differently than men?
Well,

500
00:30:24.980 --> 00:30:26.860
in reference to the bones with women,

501
00:30:26.890 --> 00:30:30.580
I don't think we speak to are 52% of the population.

502
00:30:30.610 --> 00:30:33.340
My counterpart enough.
And what they don't realize,

503
00:30:33.341 --> 00:30:37.180
women are partaking in athletics all the time.
Now.
I mean,
when I went to school,

504
00:30:37.181 --> 00:30:40.270
there was something called,
I think it was title nine women are playing sports.

505
00:30:40.420 --> 00:30:45.420
So what happens is if women get anything that revolves around a eating disorder

506
00:30:47.020 --> 00:30:50.230
or not eating enough food,
they get something called Amen area.

507
00:30:50.260 --> 00:30:51.910
It's a loss of a menstrual cycle.

508
00:30:51.940 --> 00:30:55.120
Lots of a menstrual cycle for three months or longer and not getting one.

509
00:30:55.300 --> 00:30:57.730
This amen.
Aria enables women,

510
00:30:57.790 --> 00:31:01.210
unfortunately to get osteoporosis about a decade earlier.

511
00:31:01.330 --> 00:31:05.110
So women should supplement and eat a good diet and consider calcium.

512
00:31:05.290 --> 00:31:07.870
The best form of calcium,
if anybody's interested,

513
00:31:08.110 --> 00:31:12.100
is microcrystalline hydroxyapatite concentrate.
Don't make me say it again.

514
00:31:12.730 --> 00:31:17.560
MCHC so you want a good form of calcium with a good diet to make sure your bones

515
00:31:17.561 --> 00:31:21.580
are not susceptible to osteoporosis.
By the way,
men at 40,

516
00:31:21.910 --> 00:31:25.840
we overtake women.
We lose 2% of our bone density verse 1% of them.

517
00:31:26.110 --> 00:31:27.430
So we always have to eat well.

518
00:31:27.431 --> 00:31:30.880
We always have to consider supplements and we always have to exercise.

519
00:31:30.881 --> 00:31:32.560
And you have to get a doctor,

520
00:31:32.740 --> 00:31:36.880
you have to get a doctor that's individualizing the treatment for your needs.

521
00:31:36.881 --> 00:31:40.900
You're not a number,
you're a person.
So,
um,

522
00:31:41.590 --> 00:31:46.030
what would you say some of the real key takeaways that you want people to take

523
00:31:46.031 --> 00:31:49.120
away from this book when they read it?
So for me that it's,

524
00:31:49.150 --> 00:31:52.510
it's a few fold if when you guys read it,
and thank you for having me here.

525
00:31:52.510 --> 00:31:56.170
I greatly appreciate that one.
Therapeutic lifestyle is the way to go.

526
00:31:56.200 --> 00:31:59.440
Change your life.
Um,
number two,

527
00:31:59.450 --> 00:32:02.510
what's most interesting is I always,
as I said earlier,

528
00:32:02.511 --> 00:32:05.770
I like people to implement.
So knowledge plus power,

529
00:32:06.580 --> 00:32:11.380
knowledge plus action equals power.
The power is in getting you healthy.

530
00:32:11.650 --> 00:32:14.620
You know the Times that I start to think and I get excited,

531
00:32:14.621 --> 00:32:15.760
I have to stand for this.

532
00:32:16.840 --> 00:32:20.680
I start to think about Norman cousins and he had one of the greatest

533
00:32:20.681 --> 00:32:22.840
motivational lines I have ever heard.

534
00:32:23.260 --> 00:32:26.320
He said the tragedy of life is not death,

535
00:32:26.530 --> 00:32:29.140
but what we let die inside of us.
Why we live.

536
00:32:29.260 --> 00:32:31.900
So do not let your zest for health die.

537
00:32:31.901 --> 00:32:35.020
Do not let your friends asked for health die.
Never.

538
00:32:35.170 --> 00:32:40.130
Health is one of the most important things.
If by any chance you guys are,

539
00:32:40.220 --> 00:32:43.130
you know,
faltering on that are not getting energy.
Trust me,

540
00:32:43.131 --> 00:32:46.230
I am the energizer bunny rabbit.
If you didn't notice that I am it out.

541
00:32:46.300 --> 00:32:48.380
They've gotten me medicated to stay calm.

542
00:32:48.980 --> 00:32:53.000
My Wick Burns three 65 24 seven.

543
00:32:53.060 --> 00:32:56.420
So if you ever need anybody to pump you up,
you come to me.

544
00:32:56.421 --> 00:32:59.840
Cause my Wilco light everybody else's in the room and we'll get outside and

545
00:32:59.841 --> 00:33:01.160
start changing healthcare.

546
00:33:01.310 --> 00:33:05.840
So if you will just remember you can change and you can change tomorrow.

547
00:33:07.100 --> 00:33:10.760
Well said.
Thank you.
Uh,
does anyone have any questions?

548
00:33:12.590 --> 00:33:15.650
<v 3>Thank you for coming here today.
Um,</v>

549
00:33:16.940 --> 00:33:19.010
I would like to have,

550
00:33:19.460 --> 00:33:24.460
I mean I got your take on gluten but I'm still like not convinced really.

551
00:33:26.810 --> 00:33:29.990
Why really do you think it's bad for you?

552
00:33:30.050 --> 00:33:34.190
And do you have like studies or anything that really shows it?

553
00:33:34.470 --> 00:33:35.101
<v 0>Absolutely.</v>

554
00:33:35.101 --> 00:33:39.840
Gluten is broken up into two different proteins and those proteins have shown

555
00:33:39.841 --> 00:33:43.470
through,
Oh my goodness.
A lot of different studies to cause.
Um,

556
00:33:43.920 --> 00:33:48.300
deleterious affects bad effects on people's health if they damage the god.

557
00:33:48.760 --> 00:33:53.690
One of the proteins is the one that I referred to a gliadins and in that protein

558
00:33:54.140 --> 00:33:57.510
in 100% of people studied damage to the gut.
Listen,

559
00:33:57.511 --> 00:34:01.170
I understand that you may like bread.
It does taste pretty good.

560
00:34:01.380 --> 00:34:04.910
Unfortunately man makes it.
And what's happened is,
you know,

561
00:34:04.920 --> 00:34:07.170
it's not the same bread that we had 40 or 50 years ago.

562
00:34:07.500 --> 00:34:09.240
I mean you have to understand where it's coming from.

563
00:34:09.510 --> 00:34:12.060
You have to understand where that weeds coming from our soil.

564
00:34:12.210 --> 00:34:15.510
But to speak to gluten,
there is a ton.

565
00:34:15.511 --> 00:34:17.310
I mean I can give you a ton of studies later.

566
00:34:17.311 --> 00:34:21.030
I mean probably 300 if you really want to stay up all night and you can see that

567
00:34:21.031 --> 00:34:24.660
gluten is very deleterious.
What's most interesting about gluten,

568
00:34:24.750 --> 00:34:26.910
and I'm happy you brought that up,
it's a great question,

569
00:34:27.450 --> 00:34:32.430
is that Celiac disease is the height of having new gluten issue by one in a

570
00:34:32.430 --> 00:34:37.430
hundred people have celiac disease and 30% of Americans now are doing a gluten

571
00:34:37.561 --> 00:34:41.070
free diet with no change in a number of celiac disease.
And that's why that six,

572
00:34:41.071 --> 00:34:44.700
our program is so critical cause he got to fix the damage at the Grande does.

573
00:34:47.030 --> 00:34:50.510
Thank you.
Thanks Pete.
Thanks.
That was great.
Any other questions?

574
00:34:50.570 --> 00:34:54.950
We'll have a sandwich later man.
Yeah,
so I have a question.
So,
um,

575
00:34:55.640 --> 00:34:58.820
weight loss diet,
we talked about that.
But,
um,

576
00:34:59.240 --> 00:35:02.820
you have a couple of good bullet points,
you know,
for uh,

577
00:35:04.010 --> 00:35:07.130
you know,
we're always concerned about calories and counting calories.

578
00:35:07.770 --> 00:35:09.710
Your take is a little different,
right?

579
00:35:09.711 --> 00:35:13.610
I'm not a big proponent of counting calories,
calories,
it just units of energy.

580
00:35:13.700 --> 00:35:16.840
I want everybody in here to start counting chemicals.
I want everybody to hear,

581
00:35:16.860 --> 00:35:19.970
start counting nutritional value versus calories.

582
00:35:20.210 --> 00:35:23.660
I want everybody to start thinking about if it's made in a plant,
I won't eat it.

583
00:35:23.661 --> 00:35:27.230
But if it comes from a plant,
I'll consume it.
So that's the concept.

584
00:35:27.231 --> 00:35:30.200
Calories or just a basic unit of energy,
but not all the carers.

585
00:35:30.201 --> 00:35:32.660
And the same because when you think about it,

586
00:35:32.661 --> 00:35:36.050
if I took you down the road and you've got a Frappaccino for a thousand
calories,

587
00:35:36.080 --> 00:35:38.610
is that the same if I gave you a fist full of Broccoli?

588
00:35:39.570 --> 00:35:43.530
Not all calories are equal.
So A,

589
00:35:43.531 --> 00:35:44.790
we're on the run a lot.

590
00:35:44.910 --> 00:35:49.380
We don't have time to buy fresh vegetables,

591
00:35:49.381 --> 00:35:52.080
sliced him up,
make a Greek salad every day.
You know,

592
00:35:52.081 --> 00:35:56.820
what are you recommending for people who have a very fast paced job with an

593
00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:59.270
incredibly small amount of time to even eat?
I mean,

594
00:35:59.510 --> 00:36:01.170
I would say most people in this room,
including myself,

595
00:36:01.171 --> 00:36:04.970
we did our our desk if we're working,
you know,
absolutely.
But food,
you know,

596
00:36:04.980 --> 00:36:07.620
food is a potentiator for inflammation and food is life.

597
00:36:07.800 --> 00:36:10.560
So this is the one thing I'm going to say,
plan for it.
I mean,

598
00:36:10.650 --> 00:36:11.610
I lay my clothes out the night,

599
00:36:11.640 --> 00:36:14.760
the day before planned for it and make good choices.

600
00:36:14.790 --> 00:36:18.030
You're fortunate here on Google,
I saw the options you had to have.
Fantastic.

601
00:36:18.360 --> 00:36:21.960
So for the people out there that are watching make better choices.

602
00:36:22.020 --> 00:36:25.090
So for instance,
if you're going to get something on a run,
get it baked,
steamed,

603
00:36:25.110 --> 00:36:28.350
broiled,
don't get it fried.
Make those changes.

604
00:36:28.380 --> 00:36:32.130
Make sure that you eat from the color rainbow.
Eat a lot of Greens.

605
00:36:32.280 --> 00:36:37.280
Start Understanding that your best bet is Greens and protein and avoid sugar.

606
00:36:38.460 --> 00:36:40.410
Sugar is a toxin.

607
00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:46.890
Sugar is a toxin.
Avoid sugar.
If you just cut sugar out,

608
00:36:47.070 --> 00:36:49.020
you wouldn't be impressed.
In nine days.

609
00:36:49.021 --> 00:36:51.600
There've been studies that have shown if people decrease sugar,

610
00:36:51.810 --> 00:36:54.210
they decreased their heart markers,

611
00:36:54.330 --> 00:36:58.650
adverse hard markers by 50% I have a lot of friends,

612
00:36:58.651 --> 00:36:59.431
myself included,

613
00:36:59.431 --> 00:37:04.431
who can justify eating bad food if I just go to the gym enough or you know,

614
00:37:04.951 --> 00:37:09.420
I mean,
is there a,
can there be a balance?
I mean,
well,
you cannot run a bad diet.

615
00:37:09.421 --> 00:37:13.710
So that's what you should tell them.
Elaborate on that.
Well,
you know,

616
00:37:13.711 --> 00:37:18.240
exercise is great and exercise.
It is his life movement is life.

617
00:37:18.270 --> 00:37:19.920
But when you really think about it,

618
00:37:20.190 --> 00:37:24.900
if you're consuming a lot of garbage and things that are full of calories and

619
00:37:24.901 --> 00:37:28.770
things that are full of chemicals and it out of not true nutrient value,

620
00:37:29.010 --> 00:37:33.030
what's going to happen is you can't outrun it.
You can't overtake it.

621
00:37:33.150 --> 00:37:36.810
So it's that equation of exercise plus Diag,

622
00:37:36.900 --> 00:37:40.380
decreasing stress and enjoying life.
No one,
you know,

623
00:37:40.410 --> 00:37:42.390
the biggest problem that people have when they come,

624
00:37:42.570 --> 00:37:46.440
they think a healthy diet refers to the idea that it won't taste good.

625
00:37:46.770 --> 00:37:51.240
And that's not true.
If anything,
once you try it,
you're gonna love it.

626
00:37:52.230 --> 00:37:53.063
Hi there.

627
00:37:53.570 --> 00:37:56.690
<v 4>I'm Taylor.
Thanks for coming today.
Taylor.
Just a quick question.</v>

628
00:37:56.691 --> 00:38:01.250
So I'm hearing no sugar,
no gluten,
no leave,
no this,
no that.

629
00:38:01.360 --> 00:38:01.790
Um,

630
00:38:01.790 --> 00:38:06.110
what about the everything in moderation policy or what can we do to sort of live

631
00:38:06.111 --> 00:38:10.010
in the world that we exist in and in a city where we're surrounded by food all

632
00:38:10.070 --> 00:38:14.930
the time.
Um,
that's still like mindful of uh,
you know,

633
00:38:15.050 --> 00:38:16.370
the best health practices.

634
00:38:16.590 --> 00:38:19.950
<v 0>Well don't make sure you don't eat anything with added sugar.</v>

635
00:38:20.100 --> 00:38:22.770
So we have a problem.
And so for instance,

636
00:38:22.771 --> 00:38:27.771
if you were to look at that food label now since 2014 the food labels talk about

637
00:38:27.991 --> 00:38:32.070
fructose,
but it's not really fructose,
which is fruit sugar.

638
00:38:32.250 --> 00:38:35.280
It's high fructose corn syrup.
So things are mislabeled.

639
00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:39.370
My theory is as long as you can see what you're getting,
you can eat it.

640
00:38:39.970 --> 00:38:42.250
Obviously the leaving the Abil,
you know how I feel about that.

641
00:38:42.251 --> 00:38:44.770
Use some natural supplements.
Try not to eat,
you know,

642
00:38:44.771 --> 00:38:47.740
limit the amount of sugar that you do.
And I mean,

643
00:38:47.741 --> 00:38:51.940
gluten is just basically at this point a true no go.
I mean,

644
00:38:52.390 --> 00:38:54.160
don't shoot the Messenger.
Just be happy.

645
00:38:54.161 --> 00:38:58.180
I'm going to give you the message and it'll be fine.
Life will go on.
Do you know,

646
00:38:58.360 --> 00:39:01.120
again,
any restaurant has a gluten free menu.
Now

647
00:39:03.630 --> 00:39:07.980
what about like,
um,
snacking,
um,
almonds?
You know,

648
00:39:07.981 --> 00:39:12.480
can you give us a list of like some great things that are safe to eat and easy

649
00:39:12.481 --> 00:39:16.620
to get?
Great,
great choice.
Ahmed's are a great choice.
Please have them raw.
Um,

650
00:39:16.621 --> 00:39:19.410
what they'll try and do is they'll try and cook them with like a peanut oil,

651
00:39:19.500 --> 00:39:23.030
which is unhealthy for your soap.
Run nuts are a great choice.
Avocado.

652
00:39:23.040 --> 00:39:26.980
So what do I travel with?
I put hard boiled eggs in their eggs are fabulous.

653
00:39:26.981 --> 00:39:30.450
Some nice cage free eggs.
I carry that around.
I carry some almonds,

654
00:39:30.570 --> 00:39:33.780
I carry some Avocados and leave and carry around some berries.

655
00:39:34.020 --> 00:39:36.000
These are all great choices.

656
00:39:36.270 --> 00:39:41.270
Just it's easy as this eating nonprocessed food diet is your best option.

657
00:39:42.480 --> 00:39:47.460
Eat from the color rainbow.
Enjoy.
No one's asking you to stop,
man.
Makes it.

658
00:39:48.060 --> 00:39:51.840
Jack Lane was right.
Don't eat it.
Did you have a follow up?

659
00:39:52.200 --> 00:39:55.810
<v 3>Yeah.
You mentioned the meantime getting your protein,
right,
right.</v>

660
00:39:55.830 --> 00:40:00.720
So is there like a Patina should favor or not in particular?

661
00:40:01.310 --> 00:40:02.143
Um,

662
00:40:02.190 --> 00:40:07.190
let's say animal animal protein versus plant plant based protein?

663
00:40:08.350 --> 00:40:09.400
<v 0>Well that's a great question.</v>

664
00:40:09.401 --> 00:40:11.800
That's one of the biggest arguments in the field plant.

665
00:40:11.801 --> 00:40:15.640
So plant based protein on ball for if you're going to do an animal based,

666
00:40:15.641 --> 00:40:19.540
which I like and I do consume,
you want grass fed beef,

667
00:40:20.020 --> 00:40:24.250
you want grass fed organic beef,
grass fed beef is great at tying Omega threes,

668
00:40:24.251 --> 00:40:28.810
which are healthy fatty acids,
whereas most animals that were exposed to,

669
00:40:28.811 --> 00:40:32.020
if you're going to eat that or make a six very unhealthy for you.

670
00:40:32.021 --> 00:40:36.190
So grass fed beef plant,
great choices for protein,
chicken,

671
00:40:36.550 --> 00:40:39.370
Turkey and the live poultry is great.
Bison.

672
00:40:41.280 --> 00:40:42.113
<v 2>MMM.</v>

673
00:40:43.440 --> 00:40:48.230
<v 3>But uh,
I mean I heard that um,
for the,</v>

674
00:40:48.360 --> 00:40:52.320
the number one death because in the u s is a corny

675
00:40:53.200 --> 00:40:54.170
<v 0>heart disease</v>

676
00:40:54.840 --> 00:40:57.570
<v 3>and you know,
um,</v>

677
00:40:57.630 --> 00:41:01.570
it's really important not to consume like much fat to Ah,

678
00:41:01.980 --> 00:41:02.813
not get it.

679
00:41:02.880 --> 00:41:06.270
<v 0>Aww.
I love that.
Thank you so much.
You get a free lunch later for that.</v>

680
00:41:08.040 --> 00:41:12.150
I love that.
It's actually not fat that cause coronary heart disease.

681
00:41:12.630 --> 00:41:17.630
There was a study that came out and it's proven that sugar causes coronary heart

682
00:41:19.081 --> 00:41:23.550
disease,
sugar clauses,
the plaquing,
it's not fat in the problem that we had,

683
00:41:23.551 --> 00:41:24.780
and I hate to say it here,

684
00:41:25.020 --> 00:41:30.020
it just came out two weeks ago that Harvard researchers were paid to say it was

685
00:41:30.630 --> 00:41:35.030
fat that increased saturated fat,
that increased heart attack and not sugar.

686
00:41:35.031 --> 00:41:38.840
They were paid by the sugar industry.
We all know that it just came out.

687
00:41:38.841 --> 00:41:40.760
So you know,
it's not a conspiracy theory.

688
00:41:40.940 --> 00:41:43.040
And if you look at the biochemical pathways,

689
00:41:43.160 --> 00:41:47.240
sugar causes plaquing and coronary heart disease,
fats don't,

690
00:41:47.780 --> 00:41:50.780
fat is your friend.
It is not your foe anymore.

691
00:41:51.050 --> 00:41:54.440
We were not told we were misinformed.

692
00:41:54.500 --> 00:41:57.260
So that's an interesting point about the proteins too.

693
00:41:57.261 --> 00:41:59.510
Just knowing that some of these things are safe and hopefully tailor,

694
00:41:59.511 --> 00:42:01.640
that'll make you feel better too because I definitely made me feel a little

695
00:42:01.641 --> 00:42:03.720
better knowing that I could have some chicken and stuff in.

696
00:42:03.810 --> 00:42:07.820
There is plenty there to choose from,
I promise you.
Um,
did you have a question?

697
00:42:08.710 --> 00:42:11.850
<v 5>Yeah.
So you said sugar is bad,
but what about uh,</v>

698
00:42:11.950 --> 00:42:16.950
honey that gets shown to be at least some studies show that it's,

699
00:42:17.440 --> 00:42:19.840
it can be very beneficial to the buddy.

700
00:42:20.160 --> 00:42:22.010
<v 0>Well,
you know,
uh,</v>

701
00:42:22.080 --> 00:42:25.320
my functional medicine docs are definitely gonna kill me cause I'm going to say

702
00:42:25.321 --> 00:42:29.250
if it's pure honey,
it has some medicinal effects.
So I would go for that.

703
00:42:29.251 --> 00:42:31.440
But again,
you're,
if you're talking like an a Gaba,

704
00:42:31.470 --> 00:42:32.970
the way they take it out of the Cactus,

705
00:42:33.150 --> 00:42:36.690
that poses an issue because that functions in a body like high fructose corn

706
00:42:36.691 --> 00:42:40.490
syrup.
So I will tell you that if someone said they want to add a little honey to

707
00:42:40.491 --> 00:42:42.570
something,
I'm not adverse to it.

708
00:42:42.600 --> 00:42:45.480
As long as they're not adding honey to a plate of pasta.

709
00:42:45.481 --> 00:42:49.140
I know that doesn't mix or some other carbohydrate.
I'm not a very good cook.

710
00:42:49.141 --> 00:42:52.080
Everybody.
I cook funny wife once.
Yeah,

711
00:42:52.140 --> 00:42:56.040
I'll lay off the pasta honey on a Bagel.
Then I can just say that.
Uh,

712
00:42:56.160 --> 00:42:57.870
I don't cook much,
but the honey,

713
00:42:58.280 --> 00:43:03.280
if it's a little bit and it's real honey and not manufactured or anything like

714
00:43:03.421 --> 00:43:07.830
that,
I'm going to let you go with that.
How about pure maple syrup?
No,

715
00:43:08.640 --> 00:43:11.870
no dice,
no dice that's out there.
Uh,

716
00:43:12.120 --> 00:43:16.400
my dad has been experimenting last two years with intermittent fasting since

717
00:43:16.440 --> 00:43:19.410
like the greatest thing ever.
And I'm not convinced.

718
00:43:19.411 --> 00:43:22.170
Just wondering what your thoughts are.
I know you talked about like a detox,

719
00:43:22.171 --> 00:43:23.910
I don't know if that plays into it at all,

720
00:43:23.911 --> 00:43:27.030
but just your thoughts on intermittent fasting,
intermittent fasting.

721
00:43:27.031 --> 00:43:27.880
It's not in the book.

722
00:43:28.100 --> 00:43:32.340
Intermittent fasting is very different than what I purport to that a diet
should,

723
00:43:32.430 --> 00:43:37.170
uh,
adhere to.
There's not a lot of literature on it.
People like it.
Um,

724
00:43:37.380 --> 00:43:39.060
I,
for me,

725
00:43:39.061 --> 00:43:42.300
I always tell people to have like an eight or two 12 hour window between that

726
00:43:42.301 --> 00:43:45.390
last meal on that first meal that's not in a minute fasting.

727
00:43:45.391 --> 00:43:47.430
So the literature is really small on that.

728
00:43:47.480 --> 00:43:49.980
And at this point I would avoid the innovated fasting.

729
00:43:50.220 --> 00:43:53.450
Clearly the detox is different and I suggest everybody in this room started

730
00:43:53.480 --> 00:43:58.260
detox program.
Does that answer your question?
Yeah,
it does.
It shock the body,

731
00:43:58.290 --> 00:44:00.450
the metabolism and all of that.
This fast thing,

732
00:44:01.110 --> 00:44:03.030
I just think what they're doing is they're shocking.

733
00:44:03.031 --> 00:44:07.710
The body that cutting their calories and um,
they're just not eating enough.

734
00:44:07.740 --> 00:44:09.630
You know,
it was very funny.
We do need to eat,

735
00:44:09.631 --> 00:44:13.440
we need to consume our calories to have enzymatic reactions.

736
00:44:13.860 --> 00:44:18.240
So eating is good.
It's just,
again,
not the calories we eat.
Is it the chemicals,

737
00:44:18.540 --> 00:44:20.670
what's the nutritional value?
Is their satiety?

738
00:44:20.690 --> 00:44:24.210
Is there a sensation of fullness when you eat?
You know,
when you eat sugar,

739
00:44:24.211 --> 00:44:28.560
your blood,
your blood sugar goes up,
it drops down and then you want to eat more.

740
00:44:29.040 --> 00:44:34.020
And that just has that vicious cycle and blows up from that.
Hi.
Oh,

741
00:44:34.290 --> 00:44:36.360
sorry.
I thought you were standing there first.
Sorry.

742
00:44:36.950 --> 00:44:38.420
<v 3>Thanks for coming and sharing your knowledge.</v>

743
00:44:38.421 --> 00:44:41.090
I'm shifting the conversation a little bit away from food,

744
00:44:41.091 --> 00:44:44.030
but I wondered if you had any thoughts about um,

745
00:44:44.060 --> 00:44:47.810
people who like cracked her knuckles or their bones pop and how that might

746
00:44:47.811 --> 00:44:49.910
impact how else in your body?

747
00:44:50.090 --> 00:44:54.290
<v 0>Um,
you mean like why that's actually that?
Yeah.
Um,
if I do it,</v>

748
00:44:54.291 --> 00:44:57.440
it's probably gonna be different than if,
uh,
the layman person does it.

749
00:44:57.650 --> 00:44:59.540
If it goes naturally,
I'm okay with it.

750
00:44:59.541 --> 00:45:02.540
I know when I grew up they said if you do this,
you're going to get arthritis in.

751
00:45:02.541 --> 00:45:05.990
That hasn't been proven.
That's just a little sound in your fingers.

752
00:45:05.991 --> 00:45:10.991
But my opinion would be have a professional do it because you get a better

753
00:45:11.241 --> 00:45:15.110
clinical outcome with that.
But um,
if it goes on its own,

754
00:45:15.230 --> 00:45:16.490
I mean you may be leading to that.

755
00:45:16.491 --> 00:45:20.630
Like if you move around to hear some crackling,
if you will,
that's not bad.

756
00:45:21.920 --> 00:45:24.470
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Thanks.
Hi.

757
00:45:25.050 --> 00:45:28.150
<v 3>Hi.
Um,
so you talked about the obvious,
you know,</v>

758
00:45:28.180 --> 00:45:30.520
just work out and eat a good diet.

759
00:45:30.820 --> 00:45:34.930
But you mentioned supplementation and I've experimented with supplements in the

760
00:45:34.931 --> 00:45:36.370
past because I'm vegetarian.

761
00:45:36.371 --> 00:45:40.930
So what would you say is the best regimen for someone who doesn't eat as much

762
00:45:40.931 --> 00:45:43.990
meat or fish or dairy or like you know,
obviously you can't have fish oil,

763
00:45:43.991 --> 00:45:46.360
but fish oil is a number one thing that's good for you.

764
00:45:46.361 --> 00:45:49.270
And what's the best regimen for someone like that?
Okay,

765
00:45:49.390 --> 00:45:50.830
<v 0>well in reference to the fish oils,</v>

766
00:45:50.831 --> 00:45:53.230
what you could do is you could use in algae based fish oil,

767
00:45:53.231 --> 00:45:55.630
so that would adhere with your vegetarian lifestyle.

768
00:45:55.810 --> 00:45:58.900
So why would it be a big proponent of one?
You want to get some protein in it.

769
00:45:58.930 --> 00:46:02.770
A lot of companies now I'll make a peanut rice protein pea and a rice protein

770
00:46:02.771 --> 00:46:04.300
with added amino acids.

771
00:46:04.301 --> 00:46:07.180
Branch chain amino acids has shown to be as effective as way.

772
00:46:07.330 --> 00:46:09.370
So it's a great supplement.
Um,

773
00:46:09.660 --> 00:46:12.010
with other supplements I would recommend for everybody here.

774
00:46:12.100 --> 00:46:16.330
I'll multivitamin multimineral phytonutrient excellent choices do you make a

775
00:46:16.331 --> 00:46:19.420
three is great.
Call Vitamin D,
Hormone d,

776
00:46:19.720 --> 00:46:22.090
outstanding choice probiotics.

777
00:46:22.300 --> 00:46:25.840
Just bathe your intestinal tracks and good bacteria.

778
00:46:25.870 --> 00:46:29.110
Let yourself have plenty of good bugs and make sure you're eating a lot of

779
00:46:29.111 --> 00:46:31.900
fruits and vegetables or a fruit and vegetable mix.

780
00:46:32.050 --> 00:46:36.370
Those would be the standard supplemental recommendations I would recommend for

781
00:46:36.371 --> 00:46:40.810
everybody in here and everybody out there listening,
supplemental to lifestyle,

782
00:46:40.990 --> 00:46:45.940
Diet and uh,
what are some good probiotic foods that people can have?

783
00:46:45.940 --> 00:46:49.840
Vegetarian only or is there no some good foods?
You know,

784
00:46:49.841 --> 00:46:51.320
of course yogurt comes to my beat,

785
00:46:51.350 --> 00:46:55.480
yoginis dairy and people think there's enough probiotics and yard right there.

786
00:46:55.481 --> 00:47:00.460
Millions of bugs,
bacteria,
I call them bugs.
In yogurt,

787
00:47:00.610 --> 00:47:03.850
you need billions.
So you really need,

788
00:47:03.880 --> 00:47:06.640
I hate to say we do need to supplement a,

789
00:47:06.641 --> 00:47:10.320
we're more at pulling out the bacteria.
You know,
interestingly enough,

790
00:47:10.380 --> 00:47:14.110
you had asked me a question about the issue with the medical model and I have a

791
00:47:14.111 --> 00:47:17.140
lot of respect for the medical doctors.
They're fabulous and they're brilliant,

792
00:47:17.290 --> 00:47:20.470
but they spent the 20th century taking bacteria out of our stomach with

793
00:47:20.471 --> 00:47:24.040
antibiotics and now we're spending the 21st century trying to repopulate it.

794
00:47:24.280 --> 00:47:28.030
So you really probably going to have to repopulate with a probiotic.

795
00:47:28.210 --> 00:47:28.851
But a good day,

796
00:47:28.851 --> 00:47:32.980
it's great start and good foods with a have a lot of fiber will feed the

797
00:47:32.981 --> 00:47:33.640
probiotics.

798
00:47:33.640 --> 00:47:38.110
We call those prebiotics in those prebiotics or resistance starches,

799
00:47:38.350 --> 00:47:42.340
they're actually carbohydrates that are cooked,
cooled,
and cooked again,

800
00:47:42.520 --> 00:47:43.840
and then a new thing out there.

801
00:47:43.841 --> 00:47:46.690
And I think the resistance starch is going to be your choice to consume

802
00:47:46.691 --> 00:47:48.910
carbohydrates.
So,
um,

803
00:47:49.180 --> 00:47:53.380
supplements is really the only way we can meet our probiotic,
uh,

804
00:47:53.650 --> 00:47:57.580
needs now,
isn't it?
I mean,
for what we need and where we are.

805
00:47:57.610 --> 00:48:01.390
The only way I've seen it as,
I recommend a lot of probiotics.
Yes,
I do.

806
00:48:01.480 --> 00:48:06.400
But Diet is,
remember the word supplement,
supplemental to what?
Diet,
lifestyle,

807
00:48:06.790 --> 00:48:11.080
et cetera.
Any other questions?
I think that's our time.

808
00:48:11.710 --> 00:48:15.820
Um,
Dr Rob,
this was fantastic.
I really appreciate it.

809
00:48:15.821 --> 00:48:19.720
Thank you to Google for having us.
And,
uh,
we were,

810
00:48:19.721 --> 00:48:22.690
this was wonderful.
The book is inside out health,

811
00:48:22.691 --> 00:48:26.440
but it's up there and thank you so much,
Dr. Tick.
Thank thanks for having me.
