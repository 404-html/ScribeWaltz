00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:11.130
Welcome to this talks at Google and our Seattle office.
Uh,

2
00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.450
today we have Dr Brett Finlay joining us

3
00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:21.670
since about 200 years ago when humanity first discovered microorganisms.

4
00:00:21.671 --> 00:00:26.470
We've pretty much tried our best to get rid of them and while the number of

5
00:00:26.471 --> 00:00:29.890
cholera infested wells has gone down,

6
00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:33.490
the risk for other diseases like asthma has actually gone up.

7
00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:39.310
And recent science has shown us something that we've kind of started feeling in

8
00:00:39.311 --> 00:00:42.340
our guts,
pun intended,
um,

9
00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:44.980
that are over sanitized world.

10
00:00:44.981 --> 00:00:48.970
And our attention to hyper cleanliness is actually affecting our children's

11
00:00:48.971 --> 00:00:51.010
health in a not so good way.

12
00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:56.000
So doctor Brett Findlay is an,
uh,

13
00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:00.370
professor of microbiology and immunology at the University of British Columbia

14
00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:05.140
where he is published just under 500 papers.

15
00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.420
<v 1>Okay.</v>

16
00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:11.520
<v 0>Um,
I think we're like what,
four short of 500 we talked about.
Yeah.
Um,</v>

17
00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:14.470
and has enjoyed international recognition for his work.

18
00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:20.790
He led the team that sequence the SARS genome and then develop the vaccine for

19
00:01:21.431 --> 00:01:22.264
it.

20
00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.960
<v 1>Okay.</v>

21
00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.290
<v 0>He plays a jazz saxophone.
He's,</v>

22
00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:30.590
he's got more awards than I know how to pronounce,

23
00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:35.480
but he is most notably an officer of the order of Canada,

24
00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:39.410
which is Canada's highest civilian recognition.
It's kind of like being an,

25
00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.160
the knighted,
um,
and his,
his book,

26
00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:48.140
let them eat dirt is now being translated into 11 languages.

27
00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:51.110
So let us welcome Dr Brent Finlay.

28
00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.570
<v 1>[inaudible].</v>

29
00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:59.330
<v 2>Thank you Maria.
Thank you all for coming and giving.</v>

30
00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:03.440
She's already got half the talk done,
so it's perfect.
So yeah,

31
00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:06.560
that's kind of the concept I want to discuss today about,
um,

32
00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:10.030
we will talk about kids,
but I'm also going to talk about microbes affected,

33
00:02:10.031 --> 00:02:13.010
not just kids affecting people of,
of other ages,

34
00:02:13.011 --> 00:02:17.000
including the elderly and other ages.
So my career,

35
00:02:17.001 --> 00:02:20.960
I've worked a lot on diarrhea,
Salmonella,
e coli.
So I warn you,

36
00:02:20.961 --> 00:02:22.250
I have a perverse sense of humor.

37
00:02:22.251 --> 00:02:26.900
That's why we're restricted for fecal content here.
So,
you know,
let,

38
00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:28.550
let's start,
when you think about,
you know,

39
00:02:28.551 --> 00:02:30.860
what's important to this world and you know,

40
00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:35.390
I hope you're all sort of starting to think,
you know,
yacht island place,

41
00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.580
you know,
diamond ring,
whatever.
But you know,

42
00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:39.980
really when it comes right down to it in terms of society,

43
00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:45.230
the important things our kids,
cause they're really our future.
So picture of Kid,

44
00:02:45.231 --> 00:02:50.000
right?
And um,
nice,
cute baby.
By the time I have this talk,

45
00:02:50.001 --> 00:02:53.270
I want you to think of kids more like this coded in microbes.

46
00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:58.230
So as very sad that um,

47
00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:01.960
we've known there's microbes in and on us for a long,
long time.

48
00:03:01.961 --> 00:03:05.200
So Andy van leaving hook was in the Netherlands and he was,

49
00:03:05.201 --> 00:03:08.950
he made these textiles but he was a passionate lens grinder.

50
00:03:08.951 --> 00:03:12.190
He's like making magnifying glasses and we could look at his fabrics and dies.

51
00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:14.350
And he got so good at polishing these lenses.

52
00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:17.980
He basically built microscopes and like any good scientist,
you know,

53
00:03:17.981 --> 00:03:19.960
what do you do when you build the mic?
So you'll be looking at things,
right?

54
00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:23.980
So we started looking in rainwater and they did a fascinating experiment where

55
00:03:23.981 --> 00:03:27.820
we actually swapped out his mouth in his teeth and that held up the microscope.

56
00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:31.600
And you saw all these animalcules,
all these little Wrigley things in there.

57
00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:36.910
And basically he made the stunning observation that there's more microbes than

58
00:03:36.911 --> 00:03:39.760
he could see in his mouth.
Then all the people living in Holland,

59
00:03:39.761 --> 00:03:44.761
which is where he lived and this is 330 odd years ago and don't believe them,

60
00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:47.800
all the crazy Dutchman.
But over time they've,
you know,

61
00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:51.070
they kept writing all these letters to the British academy and they just throw

62
00:03:51.071 --> 00:03:53.950
them out.
And finally they sent someone to actually look and holy smokes,

63
00:03:53.951 --> 00:03:58.300
he was right.
And that's when microbiology was discovered.
So in order for a long,

64
00:03:58.301 --> 00:03:58.931
long time,

65
00:03:58.931 --> 00:04:03.880
that microbes play a big part in this world and we just go,
you can't see him.

66
00:04:03.881 --> 00:04:07.090
Doesn't mean they're important.
I mean,
they basically were here long before us.

67
00:04:07.091 --> 00:04:09.320
They built the oxygen that we breathe.
It's worth,

68
00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:13.930
didn't have any optional that came online.
And we only think about the big ones,

69
00:04:13.931 --> 00:04:17.190
the plants and animals,
which are actually just a tiny portion of,

70
00:04:17.191 --> 00:04:21.010
of the tree of life that we see here.
And they were here long before us.

71
00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:23.410
They're gonna be here long after us.
There's a lot of microbes,

72
00:04:23.411 --> 00:04:26.260
have a lot of different kinds in this world.
Okay.

73
00:04:26.261 --> 00:04:29.320
They discover these things straight a 30 years ago they had no idea what these

74
00:04:29.321 --> 00:04:31.000
microbes do.
It was a neat novelty.

75
00:04:31.001 --> 00:04:33.580
You can find these Wrigley things all over our bodies and things.

76
00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:37.660
Then these two guys came along,
Louis pasture and Robert Coq,

77
00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:41.440
one German run freshmen.
So they hate each other,
right?

78
00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:45.970
They're competitors and but what these two guys did and their teams and other

79
00:04:45.971 --> 00:04:46.990
people in the world is,

80
00:04:46.991 --> 00:04:51.130
they basically showed that microbes actually cause infectious diseases and that

81
00:04:51.131 --> 00:04:54.850
was a big finding because up until then they had no idea what caused.

82
00:04:54.851 --> 00:04:58.720
There was all these,
you know,
thoughts of maybe it's bad air,
swamp gas.

83
00:04:58.721 --> 00:05:00.670
No one knew how infections work.

84
00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:05.230
So these guys showed that things like Yo call Rick cause disease and anthrax and

85
00:05:05.231 --> 00:05:09.370
tuberculosis.
Then Louis Pasture also showed if he cook these things,

86
00:05:09.371 --> 00:05:11.860
you killed them.
Pasteurization.
That's where it comes from.

87
00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:14.020
You couldn't transmit the disease anymore.

88
00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:16.990
So this is 125 years ago and this was cool.

89
00:05:16.991 --> 00:05:20.680
This beads that if we kill these microbes,
we wouldn't have disease,
right?

90
00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:26.100
So society went on this huge kick to basically get rid of microbes and um,

91
00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:30.580
you know,
this is World War II.
The antibiotics were invented.

92
00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:34.630
These things were amazing.
You could actually save lives by these antibiotics,

93
00:05:34.631 --> 00:05:35.740
Adam,
to bacteria,

94
00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:38.980
and they would actually then start to lyse bacteria and actually kill these

95
00:05:38.981 --> 00:05:42.430
things.
We brought in sanitation,
we started getting rid of the rats,

96
00:05:42.431 --> 00:05:45.220
we had garbage collection and you know,

97
00:05:45.221 --> 00:05:49.210
we went on this bandwagon that let's get rid of these microbes because they're

98
00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:52.390
causing these diseases.
And you know,

99
00:05:52.391 --> 00:05:55.000
we've got to this extent now that you know,

100
00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:59.300
this kills 99.9% of bacteria.
Yay,
right?

101
00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:01.910
We can get rid of these things with these antibacterial things.

102
00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:07.370
And it worked beautifully in the 1914 to 20 era.

103
00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:11.510
30% of kids less than one year of age died of infections.

104
00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:15.950
Now less than 0.1% do.
So it worked cleanest.
Great.

105
00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:20.090
And um,
you can look at it pretty much any infectious diseases you want.

106
00:06:20.091 --> 00:06:21.380
There's a bunch of listed here.

107
00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:26.180
This is 50 years of of humanity and these infections,
these goes down.

108
00:06:26.181 --> 00:06:29.210
We have vaccines,
we have antibiotics,
we've cleaned up our world.

109
00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:32.870
And so as I told you,
I worked on infectious diseases,
right?

110
00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.780
I look at this one curve.
This is not a growth industry,
right?

111
00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:38.390
I'm in trouble here.
Got to find something to help us to do.

112
00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:41.120
So this is actually only the first half of the curve.

113
00:06:41.121 --> 00:06:45.890
It's the second half that I think is so telling about society.
So again,

114
00:06:45.891 --> 00:06:49.850
the same 50 years,
look around the world.
What do people have now?

115
00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:52.580
They've got asthma,
they've got diabetes,
they've got obesity,

116
00:06:52.581 --> 00:06:55.040
they've got inflammatory bowel disease,

117
00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:57.950
the western society kind of diseases.

118
00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:00.830
What has happened at 50 years,

119
00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:03.500
because that's what two genetic generations are humans.

120
00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:07.250
It takes a hundred generations to really get genetic changes in the population.

121
00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:11.030
So we've evolved in 50 years,
we've done something to our world.

122
00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:16.190
And so the concept I'm going to try and get across is we've actually gotten to

123
00:07:16.191 --> 00:07:16.850
clean.

124
00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:20.540
And actually you will start to see these microbes are actually influencing the

125
00:07:20.541 --> 00:07:23.240
diseases that affect us on a daily basis.

126
00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:28.580
So back to microbes,
you're more microbes than you are.

127
00:07:28.581 --> 00:07:30.980
Human students are pissed off when I tell them that.

128
00:07:30.981 --> 00:07:35.030
But the number of microbes in and on you outnumbers the number of human cells,

129
00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:36.040
there's more microbes on,

130
00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:40.730
they contain 15 times more DNA then homo sapiens in you.

131
00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:43.520
So these microbes have a big influence on us.

132
00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:49.190
And the reason we start to know this and start to understand this is new

133
00:07:49.191 --> 00:07:53.240
sequencing technologies of loudest to characterize these microbes without having

134
00:07:53.241 --> 00:07:56.540
district them on a plate and then grow.
So you know,

135
00:07:56.541 --> 00:07:59.660
the mid two thousands the human genome project came online and that was a

136
00:07:59.661 --> 00:08:04.520
massive sequencing project to sequence the human genome and they daisy chained

137
00:08:04.521 --> 00:08:06.830
all these sequencers together and the world got together,

138
00:08:06.831 --> 00:08:10.520
we actually sequenced the human genome.
That was a huge milestone.
It's science.

139
00:08:10.521 --> 00:08:13.940
We can now know what the genetic coding of humans are.

140
00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:17.900
But the problem is they spent all this money sending up all these sequencers and

141
00:08:17.901 --> 00:08:21.280
training all these people.
And once his guys finished the human genome,

142
00:08:21.281 --> 00:08:23.450
they sort of looked at each other.
What are we going to do now guys?
You know,

143
00:08:23.451 --> 00:08:25.970
we've got to find something and someone said,
let's sequence microbes.

144
00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:28.550
There's lots of,
it will be six think forever and we'll keep our jobs.

145
00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:32.870
So that turned into what's now known as the human microbiome project,

146
00:08:32.871 --> 00:08:35.660
which is to sequence basically all the microbes in an honest,

147
00:08:36.710 --> 00:08:39.600
and it's been a stunning generation of data.

148
00:08:39.610 --> 00:08:42.650
It was just generates phenomenal amounts of data,
of sequencing,

149
00:08:42.651 --> 00:08:47.240
all these different microbes
and we're learning all sorts of things about them.

150
00:08:48.050 --> 00:08:49.430
There's a heck of a lot in them.

151
00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:52.760
There's a hundred trillion microbes in your body on your body,

152
00:08:53.690 --> 00:08:57.690
10 trillion in the gut.
To put that in perspective,
tip your little finger,

153
00:08:57.780 --> 00:09:00.390
cut that off.
That's about one gram.
Let's pretend it's feces.

154
00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:01.650
I told you I'm going to be gross here.

155
00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:06.000
One gram of feces contains more microbes that all the people in the world,

156
00:09:06.510 --> 00:09:09.250
so you can marvel at that tomorrow morning and go to the camp.
Um,

157
00:09:09.450 --> 00:09:13.860
there's a lot of microbes there.
And W you know,
we,

158
00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:15.570
we really started to realize this.

159
00:09:15.630 --> 00:09:19.730
I was bored one night and so I basically say,
no,
I went,

160
00:09:19.770 --> 00:09:22.920
I brushed my teeth really well.
Then they swab the cheek cell.

161
00:09:23.010 --> 00:09:26.610
It's like leaving hooked in,
and then I put on a microscope and they stained it.

162
00:09:27.270 --> 00:09:30.540
And what do you see?
See this gorgeous,
beautiful cell.
That's me,
right?

163
00:09:30.541 --> 00:09:34.080
Nice nucleus and selling everything,
but look at all the microbes stuck to it.

164
00:09:34.410 --> 00:09:37.440
That's just normal mouth.
And any of you can do this experiment.
You're,

165
00:09:37.441 --> 00:09:39.270
your mouths are full.
These microbes,

166
00:09:39.710 --> 00:09:41.610
they're sort of all different sizes and shapes.

167
00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:44.840
So we're all these critters.

168
00:09:45.450 --> 00:09:48.990
They're basically wherever your body is exposed to the environment,

169
00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:54.600
so they're on your skin,
you know they're in the oral cavity.
For example,

170
00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:58.290
the gastrointestinal track,
they basically increase the numbers as you go down.

171
00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:02.190
And by far the highest numbers of microbes is in the lower bowel and lower

172
00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:05.850
intestine,
and there's no air there.
It's Anaerobic,
and that's where they live.

173
00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:08.430
Urogenital tract,
there's microbes there.

174
00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:12.270
And each of these places is a different environment.

175
00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:15.600
So each of these places have different microbes.
The microbes on your arm pit,

176
00:10:15.601 --> 00:10:18.780
or even a very different,
which is wet than than your scalp,
which is dry.

177
00:10:19.380 --> 00:10:22.500
So each of these places in the body has these different microbes.

178
00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:27.480
But what we're learning is that actually everyone has a unique composition of

179
00:10:27.481 --> 00:10:31.380
microbes.
Genetically,
we're 99.9% the same.

180
00:10:31.381 --> 00:10:34.650
We're very well in the chromosome for male and females were very,
very similar,

181
00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:36.840
but we're not at,

182
00:10:36.841 --> 00:10:40.740
there is no single microbe is found in all people around the world and each

183
00:10:40.741 --> 00:10:44.100
person is at best,
50% of the same as someone else.

184
00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:46.800
So each of you has your own unique microbes.

185
00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:49.440
And so when we talk about things like personalized medicine,

186
00:10:49.710 --> 00:10:52.080
I argued we should talking about the micros because that's what's really

187
00:10:52.081 --> 00:10:53.190
different between people.

188
00:10:56.130 --> 00:11:01.130
So one of these things do over life while at that first magnificent moment when

189
00:11:02.281 --> 00:11:05.370
you're born,
your mother gives you your very first birthday present,

190
00:11:05.371 --> 00:11:08.910
which is a big bolus of fecal vaginal microbes.
Gross.

191
00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:10.620
But it's actually really important.

192
00:11:10.890 --> 00:11:13.320
That's when you kickstart your body for these microbes.

193
00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:15.720
Then as a kid and hills and eats these things,

194
00:11:15.721 --> 00:11:19.050
you increase the number of microbes in there and then it sort of bounces around

195
00:11:19.051 --> 00:11:23.580
in early life and then it sort of hits a kid microbiome and that stays pretty

196
00:11:23.581 --> 00:11:26.220
constant until you go through puberty.

197
00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:28.770
And the hormonal changes give you an adult microbiome,

198
00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:33.930
your microbiome from pretty much from since you hit finished puberty till really

199
00:11:33.931 --> 00:11:36.180
65 or so,
it was pretty constant.

200
00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:41.130
Unless you do something like move to another country,
become a vegetarian,

201
00:11:41.190 --> 00:11:44.260
I don't know,
swear off alcohol.
Um,
it,
it,

202
00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:47.430
it changes if you change your environment.
But if you live the same,

203
00:11:47.610 --> 00:11:51.540
your microbes stay the same.
And at the other end of the book,
end of life,

204
00:11:51.660 --> 00:11:54.340
post 65,
your microbes fall off a cliff.

205
00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:57.550
And we're just starting to realize that actually there's a lot of interference,

206
00:11:57.560 --> 00:12:00.610
these microbes in terms of aging and there's some hope that we can actually

207
00:12:00.611 --> 00:12:04.090
influence aging because if we can improve the microbes as you age,

208
00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:08.710
maybe we'll do,
okay.
So we're full of micros.

209
00:12:08.711 --> 00:12:13.540
Big Deal.
Do we need this to live?
Yes you do.
Microbes are essential for life.

210
00:12:14.820 --> 00:12:19.510
So the experiment's been done in both people and animals that let's start with

211
00:12:19.530 --> 00:12:21.130
um,
this guy named David veteran.

212
00:12:21.131 --> 00:12:25.060
He was a kid many years ago in California before he was born.

213
00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:27.670
They knew he would not have an immune system,
he didn't have it,

214
00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:30.520
and we're not immune system.
You Die.
Pretty simple.

215
00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:33.510
So what they did is it birth devices,
Arion section.

216
00:12:33.550 --> 00:12:37.300
So you can actually sterly take the kid out and then put it in a sterile

217
00:12:37.301 --> 00:12:39.670
container.
You only feed them sterile food and water.

218
00:12:40.210 --> 00:12:43.390
Now he would die except that they then fed them essential vitamins,

219
00:12:43.391 --> 00:12:47.110
cause that's microbes make these things and he can sort of live.

220
00:12:47.620 --> 00:12:52.570
And he basically spent 12 years of his life inside this bubble became known as

221
00:12:52.571 --> 00:12:55.510
the bubble boy.
He then died at 12 and infection.

222
00:12:56.650 --> 00:12:59.500
But so they're able to keep them alive by giving these key things.

223
00:13:00.010 --> 00:13:03.550
But the experiments we do in animals who are very similar,
we do the same things.

224
00:13:03.551 --> 00:13:07.420
We call these things germ free animals.
That's just code for microbe free.

225
00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:09.430
And studying these things.

226
00:13:09.431 --> 00:13:12.430
We're learning that these microbes affect how the brain develops,

227
00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:15.340
how the gut develops,
how the immune system develops.

228
00:13:15.970 --> 00:13:20.970
These are normal pieces of us that we need to develop normally and these germ

229
00:13:21.011 --> 00:13:23.590
free animals,
they're really strange in terms of,
you know,

230
00:13:23.591 --> 00:13:26.890
how they actually develop,
okay,

231
00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:30.670
we need him to live.
Do they have any effect on disease?

232
00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:34.660
This is where it gets really interesting that take a look at this list of

233
00:13:34.661 --> 00:13:38.080
diseases here,
you know all that sort of some of the western society diseases,

234
00:13:38.770 --> 00:13:40.300
all those diseases lifted there,

235
00:13:40.301 --> 00:13:43.900
the microbes in the disease patients are different than the healthy ones.

236
00:13:44.650 --> 00:13:46.600
That doesn't prove it's causing the disease.

237
00:13:46.630 --> 00:13:49.650
But there's this association and in some cases I'll tell you about,

238
00:13:49.660 --> 00:13:54.400
there actually are seem to be contributing significant to the CS.
Okay?

239
00:13:54.450 --> 00:13:58.420
They're somehow involved in these diseases.
Can we use that therapeutically?

240
00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:04.030
The answer is actually yes,
you can do a fecal transfer.

241
00:14:06.130 --> 00:14:10.630
I tried calling the number but it didn't answer.
Excuse me.

242
00:14:10.810 --> 00:14:14.380
So there's this infection called clustered,
I mean difficile,

243
00:14:14.381 --> 00:14:17.620
you cared called C diff.
So let's pretend you're old.

244
00:14:17.621 --> 00:14:20.500
You're going to the hospital and you're going to have,
say a hip transplant.

245
00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:24.730
The surgeon's fill you up with antibiotics.
What do antibiotics do?

246
00:14:24.910 --> 00:14:28.290
They carpet bomb the microbes.
The idea is to get rid of the microbes.

247
00:14:28.291 --> 00:14:30.730
So if the surgeon actually slips with a knife or whatever,

248
00:14:30.731 --> 00:14:33.130
you don't get infections.
So it's to block the infections.

249
00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:36.310
The problem is you're killing the good ones with the bat.

250
00:14:36.940 --> 00:14:40.510
And what that does is it creates a niche for this c difficile to crawl in.

251
00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:44.710
So if it's competitive in the gut,
which it is,
it's very competitive.

252
00:14:44.711 --> 00:14:46.240
It's hard for microbes to come in.

253
00:14:46.750 --> 00:14:49.300
But if you get rid of all these cause any bugs,
it crawls in,

254
00:14:49.330 --> 00:14:52.160
and this has been a big cause of death.
Many,
many people,

255
00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:55.100
they go to the hospital for an operation,
they died due to this.

256
00:14:56.270 --> 00:14:59.660
So this is a disease caused by antibiotics.
So how do you treat it?

257
00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:03.950
The give antibiotics,
while that treats maybe 20% of this,

258
00:15:03.951 --> 00:15:07.850
basically what can be a fatal disease.
So then someone reason,

259
00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:11.960
well if we could somehow replenish the feces in the gut where these microbes

260
00:15:11.961 --> 00:15:15.800
live,
we might be able to boot it out and it couldn't then cause disease.

261
00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:19.640
So they actually did fecal transfers.
You can do this two ways.

262
00:15:19.641 --> 00:15:23.000
You can nasal gastric tube down here or anima from the other end.

263
00:15:23.810 --> 00:15:26.360
There's even youtube out there.
How to DIY.

264
00:15:26.630 --> 00:15:29.930
Do not do this yourself because you perforate your bowel,
you will die.

265
00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:33.890
But all it takes is a blender according to these videos.
Uh,

266
00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:39.020
so but the neat thing is at least with this disease,

267
00:15:39.050 --> 00:15:44.030
it cured 94% of these people by simply putting healthy feces from a different

268
00:15:44.031 --> 00:15:46.550
person.
It was these Persian.
That's fantastic.

269
00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:50.090
That means we can actually start to think about treating diseases by changing

270
00:15:50.091 --> 00:15:50.924
the microbes.

271
00:15:53.090 --> 00:15:56.750
So let's spend a little bit of time more time talking about kids because this is

272
00:15:56.751 --> 00:15:58.940
where the microbes seem to have a major influence.

273
00:15:59.450 --> 00:16:01.670
And I've already said as a kid is born,
they bounced.

274
00:16:01.671 --> 00:16:04.510
The microbes kind of bounce around the first two,
three years of life.
Then what,

275
00:16:04.511 --> 00:16:08.870
about three years or so?
The micro is a pretty stable for,
for their childhood.

276
00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:15.260
Well I've already alluded to this that one of the key roles of these microbes

277
00:16:15.620 --> 00:16:18.710
early in life is to help our immune systems developed.

278
00:16:18.711 --> 00:16:22.400
Normally germ free animals,
their immune systems are really whacked.

279
00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:25.370
And what we realize there's several studies now coming out.

280
00:16:25.371 --> 00:16:29.990
They really help the immune system develop a balance so it knows which way to go

281
00:16:29.991 --> 00:16:33.920
cause it goes too far go allergic for example or autoimmune disease type things.

282
00:16:34.460 --> 00:16:37.730
And so they're really key for how this develops.

283
00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:42.770
So I'll tell you a story that that came out of our lab and that's dealing with

284
00:16:42.771 --> 00:16:47.030
asthma.
When I was a kid,
nobody had asthma.

285
00:16:47.031 --> 00:16:50.290
We had one kid in the school that had asthma.
So they must've immune,
right?

286
00:16:50.300 --> 00:16:52.470
Cause they had a puffer and you know when kids are weird they got to hit

287
00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:56.660
Newton's kind of thing.
And yet now you know you go to the playground,

288
00:16:56.661 --> 00:17:00.200
kids take a puff out of the puffer and passes to a friend and then path classes

289
00:17:00.201 --> 00:17:04.370
down the line of slide,
right?
Yeah.
20% of kids have asthma.

290
00:17:04.730 --> 00:17:07.400
And that's just a short two generation time period.

291
00:17:09.230 --> 00:17:11.330
So when you look at as a worldwide,

292
00:17:11.870 --> 00:17:14.780
what you see is it's what we call a developing country disease.

293
00:17:14.810 --> 00:17:19.250
We see it in Canada,
in the US,
we see it in the UK,
we see it in Australia.

294
00:17:19.580 --> 00:17:23.690
These are the,
you know,
the,
the,
the hyper developed countries.
Um,

295
00:17:23.870 --> 00:17:28.790
so it's,
it's associated with something changes in the world.

296
00:17:29.780 --> 00:17:34.220
So there's all sorts of hypothesis.
What is triggering as well,
what's this doing?

297
00:17:34.221 --> 00:17:37.250
This is a due to air pollution,
exposure to certain things.

298
00:17:37.251 --> 00:17:39.440
And there's obviously a lot of work and interest in this area,

299
00:17:39.770 --> 00:17:42.530
but we certainly know it's gone way up in a few years.

300
00:17:44.270 --> 00:17:49.270
So here's a few things that basically will affect your outcome of asthma.

301
00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:54.840
If you live on a farm,
you have a 20% less chance of getting asthma.

302
00:17:55.170 --> 00:17:57.510
And I love this picture.
Can you imagine writing a chicken?
I mean,

303
00:17:57.511 --> 00:18:00.630
this kid's got to have a Greek grin on their face.
Okay,

304
00:18:00.631 --> 00:18:05.631
so living on a form decreases asthma if you born by [inaudible] section.

305
00:18:06.300 --> 00:18:10.920
The simple fact of how you come into this world gives you a 20% difference.

306
00:18:11.130 --> 00:18:13.710
You 20% more risk than if you're born vaginally.

307
00:18:14.490 --> 00:18:17.820
Asthma doesn't kick in until five years later.
How on earth does,

308
00:18:17.821 --> 00:18:21.660
how you come into this world affect how you actually are going to come out.

309
00:18:22.350 --> 00:18:26.430
But we know the microbes in csection kids are different than the microbes

310
00:18:26.670 --> 00:18:30.900
vaginally.
The ones that vaginally,
they have the mother's vaginal microbiome,

311
00:18:30.930 --> 00:18:32.820
which is important for breaking down breast milk.

312
00:18:33.270 --> 00:18:37.380
The csection kids or kid the microbes as much like the mother's skin cause

313
00:18:37.381 --> 00:18:40.620
that's what the kid is exposed to breastfeeding and other skin contact there.

314
00:18:41.220 --> 00:18:42.330
Okay.
There's the APP.

315
00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:46.440
If you have antibiotics in the first year of life,

316
00:18:46.470 --> 00:18:49.380
you again have a much higher rate of asthma and this would be not really well

317
00:18:49.381 --> 00:18:53.850
documented.
What do antibiotics do?
Affect microbes.
And finally,

318
00:18:53.851 --> 00:18:57.030
if you're breastfeeding a child,
you again have a reduced rate of asthma.

319
00:18:58.350 --> 00:19:03.270
So what all of these have in common?
Obviously my hypothesis is microbes,

320
00:19:03.271 --> 00:19:06.470
right?
So the way I got into this is,
um,

321
00:19:06.750 --> 00:19:11.100
we had been using antibiotics to affect diarrheal outcomes in our most models of

322
00:19:11.101 --> 00:19:14.310
diarrhea.
And I came home one night,
I was talking to my wife Jane,

323
00:19:14.311 --> 00:19:17.850
she's a pediatrician.
Infectious Diseases doc cause it,
Hey Jane,
you know,

324
00:19:17.851 --> 00:19:19.620
if we treat these mice with antibiotics,
swing,

325
00:19:19.621 --> 00:19:23.340
shift the microbes and affect their diarrhea.
And she sort of looked at me.

326
00:19:23.341 --> 00:19:23.801
So you know,
Brett,

327
00:19:23.801 --> 00:19:27.300
that's interesting that because there's these neat studies coming out on the use

328
00:19:27.301 --> 00:19:29.550
of antibiotics or any life effecting asthma,

329
00:19:30.210 --> 00:19:32.610
and for whatever reason that comment stuck with me and you know,

330
00:19:32.940 --> 00:19:35.670
being the good husband,
you know,
you don't believe the wife,
right?

331
00:19:35.671 --> 00:19:38.760
So you're going to look it up.
And guys,
we all know wives are right?

332
00:19:38.761 --> 00:19:39.780
Of course she was right.

333
00:19:40.350 --> 00:19:45.330
But I could find the experiment that basically proved that microbes were causing

334
00:19:45.331 --> 00:19:48.480
this album.
There's all these correlations,
but are they proving or not?

335
00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:52.530
So I'll being a scientist,
what do you do?
We do the experiment,
right?

336
00:19:53.100 --> 00:19:56.010
So I had this bright young Grad student,
Shannon Russell was her name,

337
00:19:56.370 --> 00:19:59.820
and she comes bounding into my office and we're going to start of plan a
project.

338
00:19:59.821 --> 00:20:01.160
I'm sure Shannon is thinking,
yeah,

339
00:20:01.161 --> 00:20:04.530
we're going to work in e coli or Salmonella and diarrhea.
I said,
Hey Shannon,

340
00:20:04.740 --> 00:20:09.240
let's work on asthma.
You know,
it was a new graduate.
Students say,
okay,
sure.

341
00:20:09.241 --> 00:20:13.980
And um,
so bless her heart,
she bit the bit the dare.
And away we went.

342
00:20:14.850 --> 00:20:18.930
So we started off with just doing some very simple experiments were in treating

343
00:20:18.931 --> 00:20:20.100
mice with antibiotics.

344
00:20:20.130 --> 00:20:24.240
There's a most asthma model they all use and we're going to see can we affect

345
00:20:24.241 --> 00:20:26.340
the outcome of asthma in an experimental model.

346
00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:31.320
What we did is we took my very early in life or adult mice and just treat with

347
00:20:31.321 --> 00:20:33.030
antibiotics and then induce asthma.

348
00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:37.860
And what we found is that in the early ones,
and these are mice are really young,

349
00:20:37.861 --> 00:20:41.700
they're still,
I'm breastfeeding.
If you shift their microbes with antibodies,

350
00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:45.710
they had profound rates of asthma.
The Guy I worked with,
the asthma,

351
00:20:45.890 --> 00:20:49.750
he'd never seen rates like this yet.
If we did it to adult most,

352
00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:53.260
we didn't see any effect.
So you know,

353
00:20:53.261 --> 00:20:56.650
okay what p we cured most asthma,
this is a,
you know,
a major worldwide problem,

354
00:20:56.651 --> 00:20:59.470
blah blah blah.
So we said,
well let's do it in kids.

355
00:20:59.740 --> 00:21:04.180
So what we did is he grabbed a cohort of kids and we did some experiments in

356
00:21:04.181 --> 00:21:09.181
these kids and so there was this cohort of 2,500 Canadian cans and they'd been

357
00:21:09.461 --> 00:21:13.990
looking at roles of asthma and say if there's a smoker in the house or a dog in

358
00:21:13.991 --> 00:21:16.030
the house kind of thing,
look these risk factors.

359
00:21:16.450 --> 00:21:20.590
And I called these guys up and say,
hey guys,
collect the feces.
And they say,

360
00:21:20.591 --> 00:21:23.230
Oh God,
there's Finley fancies again kind of thing.

361
00:21:23.230 --> 00:21:27.940
You know how really really collect the feces.
So for whatever reason,

362
00:21:27.941 --> 00:21:30.970
I don't know why they listened to me and they started collecting the feces of

363
00:21:30.971 --> 00:21:33.100
three months old and one year old kids.

364
00:21:33.130 --> 00:21:35.020
Cause when we translate the most timelines,

365
00:21:35.021 --> 00:21:36.970
that's what we were thinking of be early time period.

366
00:21:37.780 --> 00:21:41.320
Then we looked at the feces in these and these kids at three months and one year

367
00:21:41.321 --> 00:21:44.620
of age and what we've found is the feces of a three month old,

368
00:21:44.621 --> 00:21:48.370
so that's a really itty bitty little baby for microbes.

369
00:21:48.430 --> 00:21:51.700
If that kid had those microbes,
that kid,
we're not going to get asthma.

370
00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:54.460
If that kid did not have those microbes,

371
00:21:54.580 --> 00:21:58.930
that kid was at really high risk for asthma.
By the time they got to one year,

372
00:21:59.350 --> 00:22:00.640
it didn't have any effect.

373
00:22:01.570 --> 00:22:06.340
And so we did the really fun experiment where basically we took a germ free

374
00:22:06.341 --> 00:22:10.510
animal so no microbes in it whatsoever and we took the feces from a three month

375
00:22:10.511 --> 00:22:13.990
old kid that we knew actually went on to get asked but didn't have those four

376
00:22:13.991 --> 00:22:18.220
bugs and we basically put that in this germ free animal or we took that same

377
00:22:18.221 --> 00:22:22.180
thesis and spike in those four bugs and the put in that animal and we put those

378
00:22:22.181 --> 00:22:26.860
four microbes into the human feces into this most you could actually then block

379
00:22:26.890 --> 00:22:27.723
most asthma.

380
00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:31.120
So that's as close as we are now to actually showing that these things are

381
00:22:31.121 --> 00:22:33.760
actually playing a role.
But you could see where this can go.

382
00:22:33.761 --> 00:22:35.320
You could actually think about it can't,

383
00:22:35.321 --> 00:22:38.950
you could test her microbes and if they're,
if they don't have these four,

384
00:22:38.951 --> 00:22:43.300
you could think about sort of a probiotic type intervention.
We're not there yet,

385
00:22:43.301 --> 00:22:44.350
but that's where we're heading to.

386
00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:49.630
So what about some of these other weed problems talked about obesity.

387
00:22:49.690 --> 00:22:53.980
We know obesity is a major problem in our society.
What we're seeing is,

388
00:22:54.130 --> 00:22:57.820
I actually changed this and put a Canadian map there cause I had an American map

389
00:22:57.821 --> 00:23:01.540
but it looked too much like a political map of um,
you know,
so I think,
wow,

390
00:23:01.570 --> 00:23:05.710
we will stick with Gannett and be safe here.
It actually does.

391
00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:09.490
It's an uncanny when you look at obesity rates and political allegiances,

392
00:23:10.210 --> 00:23:13.300
the,
I shouldn't say that.
Um,
anyway,
so,

393
00:23:13.301 --> 00:23:16.900
so obesity is being a problem for a while where it's a real problem now is

394
00:23:16.901 --> 00:23:20.140
pediatric obesity,
childhood obesity is just gone through the roof.

395
00:23:20.141 --> 00:23:22.630
You're seeing these three,
four year olds are actually obese.

396
00:23:24.520 --> 00:23:27.430
What do microbes have to do with this?
The answers everything.

397
00:23:28.150 --> 00:23:30.790
So several years ago,
and I guy named Jeff Gordon,

398
00:23:30.791 --> 00:23:32.020
did some really neat experiments.

399
00:23:32.021 --> 00:23:35.260
We took a fat mouse and it a fecal transfer into thin bowls,

400
00:23:35.410 --> 00:23:37.660
the thin most got fat.
He took a thin,

401
00:23:37.661 --> 00:23:40.480
most did a fecal transfer of fat mouse that most got thin.

402
00:23:41.020 --> 00:23:44.040
He took that people's feces put in thin,
my steak on fad,

403
00:23:44.920 --> 00:23:48.740
the microbes CTB controlling this whole thing that actually makes sense because

404
00:23:48.741 --> 00:23:53.310
the microbes break down a lot of what you eat.
And we know that in the obese,
um,

405
00:23:53.450 --> 00:23:56.840
animals and people,
the microbes in there are really,

406
00:23:56.841 --> 00:24:01.370
really good at generating extra energy for per unit of food coming in.

407
00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:04.150
They're really good at it.
And,
um,

408
00:24:04.250 --> 00:24:06.710
the microbes from the thin people are actually kind of woozy APP.

409
00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:12.530
So that's a really neat stuff coming out in how microbes influence in this whole

410
00:24:12.531 --> 00:24:16.840
thing.
Um,
there's this,
um,
uh,

411
00:24:16.850 --> 00:24:20.600
Israeli friend of mine that,
that started this company.
It's called day two.

412
00:24:20.601 --> 00:24:24.020
What he did is he made a bunch of Israelis were these glucose monitors around

413
00:24:24.440 --> 00:24:29.060
and monitored all of microbes they had.
And all the food they're reading.
Now,

414
00:24:29.090 --> 00:24:33.260
if you get a glucose spike that basically excess glucose spikes lead to obesity,

415
00:24:33.261 --> 00:24:36.800
which then leads to type two diabetes so you don't want glucose spikes with your

416
00:24:36.801 --> 00:24:40.970
food,
so he mapped all these microbes and all these food types based on that.

417
00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:46.000
He can now analyze your feces for $300 and he will say you have these microbes

418
00:24:46.101 --> 00:24:49.100
and based on that you should eat these foods and you have those microbes.

419
00:24:49.100 --> 00:24:51.040
So based on that,
you can eat these.
And ironically,

420
00:24:51.050 --> 00:24:53.960
some people can eat as much ice cream as they want,
they don't get glucose bites.

421
00:24:53.990 --> 00:24:54.321
Others,

422
00:24:54.321 --> 00:24:57.830
it just goes through and each person is different because they have different

423
00:24:57.831 --> 00:24:58.664
microbes.

424
00:24:59.270 --> 00:25:03.620
The really fun stuff is that when you then compare that head to head with the

425
00:25:03.621 --> 00:25:07.640
standard diets,
Atkins,
weight watchers,
et Cetera,
it works great.

426
00:25:07.670 --> 00:25:11.210
It just blows the others away.
So I think we're going to see the next few years,

427
00:25:11.211 --> 00:25:15.050
this whole personalized diet kind of thing based on what your microbes are and

428
00:25:15.051 --> 00:25:15.884
how they do

429
00:25:19.340 --> 00:25:23.270
another major disease.
We're seeing a lot of his inflammatory bowel disease.

430
00:25:23.330 --> 00:25:25.130
This is basically inflammation of the gut.

431
00:25:25.340 --> 00:25:27.140
This is Crohn's and ulcerative colitis.

432
00:25:27.170 --> 00:25:30.230
Basically your gut is on fire and it's a really tough disease.

433
00:25:31.100 --> 00:25:32.150
But because it's the gut,

434
00:25:32.151 --> 00:25:37.040
you can imagine there's microbes associated with this and they're really

435
00:25:37.041 --> 00:25:38.420
starting to make some progress in here.

436
00:25:38.420 --> 00:25:41.390
And they've actually been starting to do a lot of fecal transfer experiments.

437
00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:45.620
And interestingly,
sometimes it works,
sometimes it doesn't.

438
00:25:46.740 --> 00:25:50.930
Well it actually makes sense because we don't know what the perfect donor is
yet.

439
00:25:51.380 --> 00:25:53.210
And so when a donor gives it,

440
00:25:53.211 --> 00:25:57.380
you're asking these bugs to come in to put the fire out,
you know,
got on fire,

441
00:25:57.730 --> 00:26:01.790
route out all the other bad bugs,
settle the inflammation down and take hold.

442
00:26:02.030 --> 00:26:05.160
And that's a big ask.
So I think the whole thing with,

443
00:26:05.180 --> 00:26:08.930
with IBD right now is we have to figure it out,
figure out who's stool has the,

444
00:26:08.950 --> 00:26:13.010
the magic juice in terms of the bugs that could actually then do this.

445
00:26:13.980 --> 00:26:18.980
One thing I will say about IBD is the only adverse effect so far correlated with

446
00:26:19.221 --> 00:26:24.221
a fecal transfer is a thin woman who had IBD and she had no beast,

447
00:26:25.311 --> 00:26:27.170
healthy sister.
So bees,

448
00:26:27.171 --> 00:26:31.250
healthy sister donated her thesis to thin woman is her sister.
She got better,

449
00:26:31.340 --> 00:26:36.000
Yay.
Chef's got obese bad.
So now the sister is suing the other sister for this.

450
00:26:36.210 --> 00:26:39.680
So
that's the only fecals issue.

451
00:26:39.681 --> 00:26:43.560
So an area I know would love that,
um,

452
00:26:43.940 --> 00:26:47.550
that that we spent a lot of time on is diarrhea and microbes.

453
00:26:47.551 --> 00:26:50.160
And we've already talked a little bit about c diff and the microbes and we've

454
00:26:50.161 --> 00:26:54.090
done a lot of experiments in both Salmonella Nikolai showing the microbes were

455
00:26:54.091 --> 00:26:56.490
really influenced the outcome of disease.

456
00:26:56.491 --> 00:27:00.380
And so we're working at this in terms of preventing diarrhea in area.

457
00:27:01.590 --> 00:27:06.590
Probably the most profound area I think that this is seeing a lot of interest in

458
00:27:06.660 --> 00:27:07.560
is in the brain.

459
00:27:08.580 --> 00:27:12.720
I told you that microbes and germ free animals that are germ free,

460
00:27:12.900 --> 00:27:17.190
their brains don't develop normally and there's lots of studies coming out how

461
00:27:17.191 --> 00:27:21.600
microbes,
you can take a depressed mouse stressed most or an anxious,

462
00:27:21.601 --> 00:27:25.140
most put it into a normal mouse.
It will become stressed,

463
00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:29.120
anxious or depressed simply by transferring the microbes.
Um,

464
00:27:29.250 --> 00:27:33.690
there's lots of studies coming out indicating at this,
um,
autism.

465
00:27:33.780 --> 00:27:37.590
There's,
which is obviously a,
you know,
a very contentious area right now.
There's,

466
00:27:37.620 --> 00:27:40.680
there's hints hands-up microbes in it.
They definitely have different microbes,

467
00:27:40.681 --> 00:27:43.830
but autistic kids might be eating differently.
There's an argument there.

468
00:27:44.580 --> 00:27:48.510
There's a few one offs of fecal transfers were an autistic kid got to fecal

469
00:27:48.511 --> 00:27:52.030
transfer seem to behavior became better.
So,
but it's,

470
00:27:52.031 --> 00:27:54.080
and there's actually a study out last week or where they,

471
00:27:54.110 --> 00:27:58.050
they did fecal transfers on 18 kids and saw a major improvement at eight weeks

472
00:27:58.051 --> 00:28:00.930
in these 18 autistic kids.
So again,

473
00:28:00.931 --> 00:28:03.630
there's hope that microbes might actually be influencing the brain.

474
00:28:04.350 --> 00:28:09.240
So there really are influencing many,
many of these childhood diseases.
Okay,

475
00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:12.270
well I think it's only one kid in the audience.
So,

476
00:28:12.271 --> 00:28:13.660
or maybe they've even gone by now one bay,

477
00:28:13.661 --> 00:28:16.230
but I want to talk about other aspects of life too,

478
00:28:16.260 --> 00:28:19.530
because this is not just about babies.
It affects all of us.

479
00:28:21.270 --> 00:28:24.820
Here's the top 10 reasons why you're going to die.
They get out of the CDC said,

480
00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:26.730
yeah,
I know it's a great more of it slide,
but whatever.

481
00:28:27.810 --> 00:28:32.490
When you look at this list,
how many of these are infectious?
One,

482
00:28:32.491 --> 00:28:36.060
right?
Influenza pneumonia.
So that's,
that's flu.
You know,
he'd get pneumonia,

483
00:28:36.061 --> 00:28:39.360
that that's infectious.
How many of these

484
00:28:41.070 --> 00:28:43.290
are actually linked to microbes?

485
00:28:44.230 --> 00:28:47.760
Turns out nine in these 10 diseases.
Now have a microbial link,

486
00:28:49.140 --> 00:28:52.950
heart disease,
cancer,
lung diseases,
all of these things here,

487
00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:55.020
you may think I'm crazy,

488
00:28:55.021 --> 00:28:58.410
but actually they're starting to be some really nice data coming out.

489
00:28:59.520 --> 00:29:04.500
Let's take a look at cardiovascular disease.
So that's basically,
if you blow a,

490
00:29:04.530 --> 00:29:08.700
um,
uh,
an artery in the brain,
you have a stroke.
If it's in the body,

491
00:29:08.760 --> 00:29:12.510
you have a heart attack.
So that's basically heart attacks and strokes combined.

492
00:29:13.110 --> 00:29:16.590
And for a long time now we've known it's been associated with red meat and

493
00:29:16.591 --> 00:29:21.150
things like that.
Well,
what is now being shown is that when you eat red,
neat,

494
00:29:21.870 --> 00:29:24.430
the microbes take something called fossil.
Coleen,

495
00:29:24.431 --> 00:29:27.540
it could put a red meat converted into a molecule.
So if they called Tma,

496
00:29:28.110 --> 00:29:29.520
and that's the first step,

497
00:29:29.521 --> 00:29:32.610
and then your body takes that molecule in liver and oxidize it to something

498
00:29:32.611 --> 00:29:35.610
called Tma.
Oh,
this is what causes atherosclerosis.

499
00:29:36.300 --> 00:29:38.850
So if you take a germ free mouse that has no microbes,

500
00:29:38.851 --> 00:29:42.010
you see it as much red meat as one,
it doesn't get atherosclerosis.

501
00:29:42.970 --> 00:29:46.160
Vegans and vegetarians have very low rates of this,
you know,

502
00:29:46.161 --> 00:29:47.530
because they're not eating the red meat.

503
00:29:48.430 --> 00:29:53.380
I think the most exciting study was when they actually made enzymes,
the block,

504
00:29:53.381 --> 00:29:57.850
the microbial enzymes that do that first step and then test it lives in a most

505
00:29:57.851 --> 00:29:58.420
model.

506
00:29:58.420 --> 00:30:02.950
You could actually block it by drugging the bugs they'd been trying to drug the

507
00:30:02.951 --> 00:30:04.990
second half,
which is a Christian,
your liver.

508
00:30:05.140 --> 00:30:07.510
But all the drugs have been talks and how many are able to do it.

509
00:30:08.380 --> 00:30:11.890
So here's a neat way for two major diseases where there's obviously my critical

510
00:30:11.891 --> 00:30:15.610
component,
probably the funnest experiment I saw these guys do,

511
00:30:15.850 --> 00:30:19.330
is they convinced a Vegan who had never eaten a steak in their life to eat a

512
00:30:19.331 --> 00:30:23.050
steak.
I don't know how they did that.
But anyway,

513
00:30:23.051 --> 00:30:27.430
so Vegan eats a steak.
They measure what happens.
What do you think would happen?

514
00:30:28.030 --> 00:30:30.460
It turns out that because this person never had steaks,

515
00:30:30.461 --> 00:30:33.400
they don't have the microbes to actually do that.
So nothing happened.

516
00:30:33.790 --> 00:30:35.560
The Vega didn't make the products,

517
00:30:35.561 --> 00:30:38.380
especially with atherosclerosis because they didn't have the bugs in the first

518
00:30:38.381 --> 00:30:41.500
place to do it.
So,

519
00:30:43.300 --> 00:30:45.070
you know,
we've talked a little bit of this already,

520
00:30:45.071 --> 00:30:49.270
but stress and anxiety and depression,
this whole mind thing is that we,

521
00:30:49.271 --> 00:30:50.800
I should say the only one on the list,

522
00:30:50.801 --> 00:30:53.140
I couldn't attribute to microbes for accidents.

523
00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:56.240
So he can't say the microbes made me do it.
Honest.
Um,

524
00:30:56.980 --> 00:31:01.510
there's a big study just came out of the UK correlating antibiotic use with,

525
00:31:01.660 --> 00:31:03.310
with basically anxiety and depression.

526
00:31:03.311 --> 00:31:05.410
And bottom line is more courses of antibiotics.

527
00:31:05.470 --> 00:31:07.210
The more anxious than depressed you'll be.

528
00:31:07.750 --> 00:31:12.650
Antifungals and antivirals had no effect.
So that's,
you know,
again,

529
00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:15.440
sort of pointing to is we talked about autism,

530
00:31:15.460 --> 00:31:19.930
Adhd jetlag.
I just came back from Europe.
It's sucks.

531
00:31:19.931 --> 00:31:21.820
We all know jet lag.
It hurts,
right?

532
00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:26.740
The same Israeli guy that did the um,
obese died,
this guy's crazy.

533
00:31:26.950 --> 00:31:30.670
He basically convinces Grad students to go to all these meetings around the

534
00:31:30.671 --> 00:31:33.670
world,
collect their feces,
be jet lagged and come back.
Right.

535
00:31:34.390 --> 00:31:37.090
And the way he did it,
this is great.
He flew in business class.
So,
um,

536
00:31:37.300 --> 00:31:39.910
what grads dude is going to say no to a quick flight too,
you know,

537
00:31:39.911 --> 00:31:41.290
Israel to London and back,
right?

538
00:31:41.950 --> 00:31:44.020
And then you just collect the poop and what happens?

539
00:31:44.230 --> 00:31:48.130
It turns out microbes actually have a big influence on circadian rhythm,

540
00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:50.080
which is what jet lag is.

541
00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:53.410
And they're actually a starting to show that by affecting these microbial

542
00:31:53.411 --> 00:31:57.340
composition,
you can actually affect circadian rhythm.
So I'm dying for the day.

543
00:31:57.341 --> 00:31:59.890
When you actually take a probiotic before to Europe,
you know,
and you,

544
00:31:59.930 --> 00:32:04.330
you actually feel normal.
So again,
you know,
this whole gut brain access,

545
00:32:04.331 --> 00:32:05.500
these microbes are doing it.

546
00:32:05.501 --> 00:32:08.200
They're talking to the brain and the brain's talking to the microbes

547
00:32:10.420 --> 00:32:12.900
while we're on the brain.
And you know,
major issues are,
um,

548
00:32:13.150 --> 00:32:16.660
degenerative brain diseases.
So this is Alzheimer's and Parkinson's.

549
00:32:16.810 --> 00:32:20.290
These are very scary diseases.
But as our population ages,

550
00:32:20.291 --> 00:32:21.700
they're becoming more and more prevalent.

551
00:32:22.940 --> 00:32:25.990
Turns out there are actually things you can do that microbial link that actually

552
00:32:25.991 --> 00:32:28.630
can influence your,
your rate of outcome of these things.

553
00:32:29.320 --> 00:32:31.120
There's this diet called the mind diet,

554
00:32:31.150 --> 00:32:34.300
which is basically a modified Mediterranean diet.
It's not actually that hard.

555
00:32:34.301 --> 00:32:37.270
It's glass of red wine,
you know,
and eating the fruits,
vegetables,

556
00:32:37.271 --> 00:32:39.950
legumes and nuts,
your,
your mother tells you to eat kind of thing.

557
00:32:40.700 --> 00:32:44.510
The stylish to had spectacular results.
If you ate this kind of a diet,

558
00:32:44.540 --> 00:32:47.450
you could decrease your risk for Alzheimer's by 50%.

559
00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:52.130
I mean that is really profound.
If you didn't stick to it even perfectly,

560
00:32:52.131 --> 00:32:57.080
but you did stick to it,
you can basically decrease it by about 25 to 30%.

561
00:32:57.710 --> 00:33:01.640
So that's his diet plays a big role in,
in,
in,
in dementia and Alzheimer's.

562
00:33:02.570 --> 00:33:07.010
And I said these are western diseases and it turns out the,
um,
the loss rates of,

563
00:33:07.040 --> 00:33:10.730
of,
um,
dementia and Alzheimer's are actually a rural India,

564
00:33:11.030 --> 00:33:13.850
which obviously has a higher microbial right there.

565
00:33:15.530 --> 00:33:18.800
Here's a fun little study I found.
If you remember anything from this talk,

566
00:33:18.890 --> 00:33:22.640
just brush your teeth.
If you brush your teeth three times a day,

567
00:33:22.670 --> 00:33:26.600
you could see the numbers here that you can drop it by 22 to 65% of getting

568
00:33:26.990 --> 00:33:30.590
dementia.
They didn't say anything with dental floss,
so I can't help you there.

569
00:33:31.150 --> 00:33:31.850
Um,

570
00:33:31.850 --> 00:33:35.210
and then they also had this really nice twin study where one twin had good oral

571
00:33:35.211 --> 00:33:38.690
health and the other had poor oral health and the one with the poor oral health

572
00:33:38.720 --> 00:33:43.580
had much,
much higher rates of,
of,
of dementia.
So what does it happen?

573
00:33:43.710 --> 00:33:46.100
Why,
why is good oral health?
Well,

574
00:33:46.101 --> 00:33:50.540
turns out the biggest problem with aging is what we call inflammation.

575
00:33:50.541 --> 00:33:54.560
This low grade inflammation in our body.
And so if you have poor oral health,

576
00:33:54.561 --> 00:33:57.980
all these microbes are seeping through your gums and your body is then getting

577
00:33:57.981 --> 00:34:01.550
inflamed.
And this basically contributes to many of the effects of aging,

578
00:34:01.580 --> 00:34:04.300
especially dementia and Alzheimer's.

579
00:34:05.010 --> 00:34:09.080
So more of the stories brush your teeth can't hurt.
Right.
And,
um,

580
00:34:09.210 --> 00:34:13.370
what studies say it actually might do something.
Okay,

581
00:34:13.371 --> 00:34:16.760
let's finish up with a bit more practical stuff that those who do have kids and

582
00:34:16.790 --> 00:34:20.540
you know,
talk about what we might do.
Okay.
If micros important,
how do we fix it?

583
00:34:20.541 --> 00:34:23.000
What can we do about it?
You know,
to do this.

584
00:34:23.750 --> 00:34:26.480
So I think that the trick is to think of a balance.

585
00:34:26.990 --> 00:34:31.370
So obviously we've come a long ways of preventing kids a dieting infections.

586
00:34:31.400 --> 00:34:32.030
That's great.

587
00:34:32.030 --> 00:34:35.810
The hygiene actually works and that's been important and it's done really well,

588
00:34:36.110 --> 00:34:36.861
but we realized,

589
00:34:36.861 --> 00:34:39.830
I think we've tipped the scales too far and we now have to basically bring it

590
00:34:39.831 --> 00:34:44.090
back to these kids to have to be exposed to the microbes that they're used to

591
00:34:44.091 --> 00:34:44.811
getting exposed to.

592
00:34:44.811 --> 00:34:48.290
We've evolved with these things and allow this healthy exposure.

593
00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:51.620
Okay,
when does it start?

594
00:34:52.040 --> 00:34:56.900
It starts when the mother's pregnant and there's all sorts of neat things coming

595
00:34:56.901 --> 00:35:00.140
out showing that these microbes in the mother are actually effecting how the

596
00:35:00.141 --> 00:35:04.430
fetus develops is inside the mother.
For example,

597
00:35:04.431 --> 00:35:08.750
if you're a thin mother in third trimester,
so and you say,
oh,
I'm pregnant,

598
00:35:08.751 --> 00:35:11.780
I can gain 500 pounds for once in my life.
They don't have to die,
you know,

599
00:35:11.781 --> 00:35:16.190
and all this,
and you gain more weight than you should.
Third Trimester mothers,

600
00:35:16.340 --> 00:35:20.270
they're microbes are already going towards obese because it gives me more energy

601
00:35:20.271 --> 00:35:22.430
to drive the fetus.
Remember intelligent than me,
more energy.

602
00:35:23.240 --> 00:35:27.020
If you really overeat,
you really drive your kids to your,
your microbes.

603
00:35:27.021 --> 00:35:31.100
To obesity when the kid is born,
that kid inherits mother's microbes.

604
00:35:31.340 --> 00:35:35.300
That kid stands a much higher chance of being obese even though the mother was

605
00:35:35.301 --> 00:35:37.920
thin to begin with just by mother's microbes.

606
00:35:39.360 --> 00:35:40.470
We've talked a lot about the,

607
00:35:40.471 --> 00:35:42.840
the first birthday present of the big gulp on the way out.

608
00:35:43.050 --> 00:35:46.320
This is really important because the microbes the kid acquires these are the

609
00:35:46.321 --> 00:35:48.770
ones and actually breakdown breast milk.
Um,

610
00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:53.190
these are the ones that feed the kid and um,
and the vaginal microbes through,

611
00:35:53.191 --> 00:35:55.320
they're beneficial.
They're like probiotic bugs.

612
00:35:55.680 --> 00:35:57.660
So it's really important to get acquired to this.

613
00:35:57.661 --> 00:36:01.800
And we're working with a company now that is becoming rather popular in some

614
00:36:01.801 --> 00:36:05.910
circles too.
If you have to have a c section,
you do a vaginal swab,

615
00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:08.010
which is just like,
it sounds,
just swallow the vagina,

616
00:36:08.011 --> 00:36:10.950
kid is born and then your smear the microbes all over the mice and things like

617
00:36:10.951 --> 00:36:14.790
this to try to knock,
leave that kid with.
Um,
with this,

618
00:36:14.850 --> 00:36:18.100
the studies are not long enough yet to know whether it works or not,
but um,

619
00:36:18.390 --> 00:36:20.730
it's underway in natural pass routinely doing this.

620
00:36:22.760 --> 00:36:23.110
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

621
00:36:23.110 --> 00:36:26.290
<v 2>Breastfeeding,
I've already told you,
we all,
we know breastfeeding is better.</v>

622
00:36:26.470 --> 00:36:30.100
We've always thought because it had mother's antibodies in there.
For example,

623
00:36:30.640 --> 00:36:33.480
while we now know that in breast milk,
most of breastmilk,

624
00:36:33.790 --> 00:36:36.610
our bodies can't break down.
We don't have the enzyme to do it.

625
00:36:36.820 --> 00:36:40.360
We rely on those microbes of the kid acquired upon birth to actually break down

626
00:36:40.361 --> 00:36:44.980
the breast mound.
And more recently there's a bunch of studies now showing that,

627
00:36:45.010 --> 00:36:48.520
um,
that there's actually microbes in breast milk.

628
00:36:48.700 --> 00:36:51.730
They're actually involved in colonizing in the kit and doing it.

629
00:36:52.330 --> 00:36:55.110
So interestingly,
it's got all the formula companies scrambling.
Now,
you know,

630
00:36:55.120 --> 00:36:59.170
how can we,
you know,
improve formula to,
to put these kinds of things in here.

631
00:37:01.170 --> 00:37:04.830
Okay.
Kids starting to grow up where they do,
um,

632
00:37:05.460 --> 00:37:07.860
one of the left Pinky soother.
What do you want to call?

633
00:37:07.950 --> 00:37:10.140
Parents use this all the time.
Pacifier,
right?

634
00:37:10.170 --> 00:37:14.040
You're putting the kids most with the kids do spit it out.
Right?
Put it back in.

635
00:37:14.041 --> 00:37:16.440
Real Fun game you,
I'll spit it out.
You know,
it goes in the floor.

636
00:37:16.980 --> 00:37:18.270
Here's a shopping center.
What do you do?

637
00:37:18.960 --> 00:37:22.140
Well that fell at a study that they basically,
these parents have two choices.

638
00:37:22.141 --> 00:37:25.140
You can go into the washroom and wash it off and put it back in the kid.

639
00:37:25.320 --> 00:37:27.420
We just putting your own mouth and shovel back in the kid.

640
00:37:27.990 --> 00:37:30.480
If you put in your own mouth and shovel and the kid's face,

641
00:37:30.690 --> 00:37:34.110
those kids have much less asthma,
obesity and allergies.

642
00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:37.860
Then if you run to the washroom and wash it up so it saves a trip guys,

643
00:37:37.861 --> 00:37:41.240
you know you can,
and especially for guys because we're lazy,
you know,

644
00:37:41.270 --> 00:37:43.530
just shut up.
Good.
You know kind of thing.

645
00:37:44.300 --> 00:37:45.133
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

646
00:37:45.910 --> 00:37:48.790
<v 2>I love that picture there.
He's a better picture here.
Here we go.</v>

647
00:37:49.030 --> 00:37:52.150
It's understand advanced kills the most germs.

648
00:37:52.440 --> 00:37:55.960
It kills more than 99.9% of germs leaves the hands feeling soft.

649
00:37:56.500 --> 00:37:59.710
Chuckit this is poison.
You guys should not be using this.

650
00:38:01.960 --> 00:38:06.760
All the studies show it doesn't work and the FDA has actually try chlorella and

651
00:38:06.761 --> 00:38:09.520
is the active ingredient is actually is just bandit because there's no studies

652
00:38:09.521 --> 00:38:12.010
to show this actually works.
So,
you know,
playground,

653
00:38:12.040 --> 00:38:15.260
every diaper bag has got one of these hanging off of it,
right?
I mean,
this,

654
00:38:15.820 --> 00:38:18.250
you don't need to do this.
Soap of water is all you need.

655
00:38:18.520 --> 00:38:20.260
And also when you use this on your hands,

656
00:38:20.470 --> 00:38:23.770
you're actually killing off all the good microbes and increasing the chance of

657
00:38:23.771 --> 00:38:25.800
bad one coming in and being able to call them ice.

658
00:38:25.801 --> 00:38:28.240
So you've gotten rid of the competitors that were good in the first place.

659
00:38:28.690 --> 00:38:30.760
So throw all the hand sanitizer,
all gonna make your life easy.

660
00:38:30.761 --> 00:38:33.880
You don't even have to do that.
Just maybe wash the kids' hands before dinner.

661
00:38:33.881 --> 00:38:36.760
But that's it.
Kids,

662
00:38:37.330 --> 00:38:41.170
why do kids do they get dirty,
right?
I mean,
you know,
Hoover in kids,

663
00:38:41.171 --> 00:38:43.510
they just love to eat dirt and play in the dirt and everything.

664
00:38:44.290 --> 00:38:47.200
So if dirty exposure was so bad,

665
00:38:47.350 --> 00:38:52.030
don't you think as a species we would evolve not to get dirty all the time.

666
00:38:52.280 --> 00:38:55.720
And what does a kid do?
Puts everything in the possible in the mouth,
right?

667
00:38:56.020 --> 00:38:58.450
You know,
they just Hoover everything.
Why?

668
00:38:58.780 --> 00:39:01.120
My argument is they're trying to get some of the microbes from the world and

669
00:39:01.121 --> 00:39:02.920
we're trying,
no,
no,
don't put that in your mouth,
please.
No,

670
00:39:02.921 --> 00:39:06.170
don't you in that stick kind of thing.
So you know,
maybe,

671
00:39:06.220 --> 00:39:10.600
maybe there's a recent to it.
Okay,
here's one I really like.

672
00:39:11.230 --> 00:39:14.830
Get a dog.
What a dog's do.
They do two things.

673
00:39:15.130 --> 00:39:16.360
They roll around in the dirt,

674
00:39:16.361 --> 00:39:19.540
especially thinking finds a feces and everything else and they get really dirty,

675
00:39:19.541 --> 00:39:20.170
right?

676
00:39:20.170 --> 00:39:22.810
Then they come bounding into the house and they roll over the kid and like the

677
00:39:22.811 --> 00:39:23.860
kid and everything.
Right.

678
00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:28.060
It turns out that if you get a dog and you have a young kid in the house,

679
00:39:28.150 --> 00:39:31.630
you would decrease that kid's chance of getting asthma by 20% and you also

680
00:39:31.631 --> 00:39:33.310
decrease the chances of obesity.
That kid,

681
00:39:33.610 --> 00:39:38.410
just by the simple fact of having this dog,
cat lovers,
what do you think?

682
00:39:38.590 --> 00:39:42.220
Sorry guys.
Cast.
Just sit in the car and they go like this.
You know,

683
00:39:42.221 --> 00:39:44.560
and they're not liking the kid.
There's no dad at either way.

684
00:39:44.561 --> 00:39:45.970
Cats don't improve or just proof.

685
00:39:45.971 --> 00:39:48.160
That's because they don't think they interface with the kids as much.

686
00:39:48.880 --> 00:39:51.250
So you know that anyway.

687
00:39:51.430 --> 00:39:55.270
I don't mean to install a cat lovers not getting in trouble here.
I know.
So,

688
00:39:57.010 --> 00:40:00.790
okay.
How do you change your microbes?
The easiest way is what you eat.

689
00:40:01.060 --> 00:40:02.650
You know the expression is you are what you eat.

690
00:40:02.680 --> 00:40:04.630
I argue you microbes are what you eat.

691
00:40:05.290 --> 00:40:08.200
So we eat a lot of white flour and white sugar now,
right?

692
00:40:08.530 --> 00:40:09.850
These are processed foods.

693
00:40:09.880 --> 00:40:13.750
They're actually absorbed by the body really quickly in the upper end test.

694
00:40:13.751 --> 00:40:16.300
I'm in small and test time because you don't have to break these things down.

695
00:40:16.900 --> 00:40:19.600
She gave this great McNeil and Mcdonald's or whatever and it's going there.

696
00:40:19.601 --> 00:40:23.380
Most of it is absorbed long before it ever gets to where the microbes are,

697
00:40:23.500 --> 00:40:27.700
which is way down in the gut.
So ironically,

698
00:40:27.790 --> 00:40:31.420
you know your mother was right eat your vegetables and nuts and legumes and high

699
00:40:31.421 --> 00:40:33.730
fiber,
not so much for the nutrients,

700
00:40:33.731 --> 00:40:37.330
but if you're actually feeding the microbes and all the studies show that this

701
00:40:37.331 --> 00:40:38.770
more of a healthy diet and you know,

702
00:40:38.771 --> 00:40:42.700
decreased red meat and things is actually feeding the microbes to actually allow

703
00:40:42.701 --> 00:40:46.420
them to do their thing.
So

704
00:40:47.950 --> 00:40:50.790
this is an experiment we did lab and each of those colors,

705
00:40:50.791 --> 00:40:53.920
the different microbes in untreated and then different mice treated of two

706
00:40:53.921 --> 00:40:58.270
different antibiotics.
Antibiotics drastically impact on the microbes.

707
00:40:58.780 --> 00:41:02.800
The average kid in the U s gets 10 to 12 courses of antibiotics by the time they

708
00:41:02.801 --> 00:41:06.130
get to school.
The reason that's a problem is early in life,

709
00:41:06.131 --> 00:41:09.370
these microbes are bouncing around and if you have an antibiotic is shift that

710
00:41:09.371 --> 00:41:13.060
kids,
microbes,
they come back a bit but not the same.
Then he hit him again.

711
00:41:13.090 --> 00:41:17.170
It goes for like this and by 10 12 courses,
these microbes are over here,

712
00:41:18.010 --> 00:41:21.430
antibiotics,
we all know about the causing resistance to use them,

713
00:41:21.640 --> 00:41:24.010
but we now know is they're actually not harmless.

714
00:41:24.520 --> 00:41:26.790
And so you have to balance them.
You know,
if the kid is dying,

715
00:41:26.810 --> 00:41:29.170
bacterial infection,
of course you use antibiotics.

716
00:41:29.440 --> 00:41:33.250
But if the kid has a viral infection,
antibiotics don't work against viruses.

717
00:41:33.650 --> 00:41:35.630
Wait 24
hours and see what's happening.

718
00:41:36.620 --> 00:41:39.140
The biggest crime in antibiotics and u s and Canada,

719
00:41:39.200 --> 00:41:44.200
80% of her antibiotic use is used in agriculture because that gives you a 15%

720
00:41:44.330 --> 00:41:48.050
increase in growth weight.
They banned it in Europe.
And,

721
00:41:48.290 --> 00:41:52.940
but the problem is that gives a 50% increase in growth in any animal pigs,

722
00:41:52.941 --> 00:41:55.610
sheep,
fish,
what are the cow is you name it.

723
00:41:56.360 --> 00:41:58.160
And the studies show humans.

724
00:41:58.850 --> 00:42:01.820
So you'll maybe the success of antibiotic use in our world is actually

725
00:42:01.821 --> 00:42:04.220
influenced the major obesity epidemic we're seeing.

726
00:42:05.630 --> 00:42:08.090
So if you follow me so far and you're starting to buy in,
yeah,

727
00:42:08.091 --> 00:42:10.790
maybe these microbes important.
Here's an interesting concept.

728
00:42:11.990 --> 00:42:14.660
Every generation,
our society gets cleaner.

729
00:42:14.930 --> 00:42:17.990
Every generation we have less and less diverse microbes to choose from.

730
00:42:18.320 --> 00:42:20.810
You cannot go back to the how the microbes,
your great,

731
00:42:20.811 --> 00:42:22.370
great grandfather or grandmother had,

732
00:42:22.580 --> 00:42:25.970
he can't get them unless they're alive and hey,
give me sound kind of thing.
But,

733
00:42:26.240 --> 00:42:29.240
um,
you know,
and you know,
every generation.

734
00:42:29.241 --> 00:42:33.080
So maybe we need to rethink these guys.
These are actually endangered species.

735
00:42:33.081 --> 00:42:35.870
We've evolved with these microbes.
Yeah,
we're bonding.

736
00:42:35.871 --> 00:42:40.400
I'm like crazy know we can't go back.
We don't have the answer.
But you know,

737
00:42:40.401 --> 00:42:43.370
maybe we've got to rethink this about,
cause we evolved with these things.

738
00:42:43.371 --> 00:42:47.870
They're designed for us and we know we have these things.
And so,
um,
you know,

739
00:42:48.170 --> 00:42:51.800
interesting thoughts.
Finally I have to put a plug in for vaccines.

740
00:42:51.801 --> 00:42:56.320
There's been an awful lot of misinformation and mal information on this and to

741
00:42:56.660 --> 00:42:58.700
all the data vaccines worked.
You know,

742
00:42:58.760 --> 00:43:02.180
the whole autism was fraudulent and it's been completely just proven and

743
00:43:02.181 --> 00:43:07.070
everything.
And if you do have kids do the vaccines,
it's really,
um,
I mean,

744
00:43:07.160 --> 00:43:08.900
you know,
there's been a recent political appointments.

745
00:43:08.901 --> 00:43:12.440
I would reevaluate vaccines in the states by vaccine denier that is going to

746
00:43:12.441 --> 00:43:13.880
cost a lot of kids' lives.

747
00:43:14.150 --> 00:43:17.240
The first Bush did the experiment when they banned the whooping cough vaccine.

748
00:43:17.540 --> 00:43:20.060
Lots of kids died because it just came roaring back.

749
00:43:20.360 --> 00:43:24.410
And so I think we've got to remember that vaccines are really wonderful tool for

750
00:43:24.470 --> 00:43:25.370
many of these diseases.

751
00:43:26.420 --> 00:43:29.970
So this is a book that I've written with a coauthor,

752
00:43:29.971 --> 00:43:34.971
a postdoc mind clear Arietta and this is a book that's for sale back there that

753
00:43:35.031 --> 00:43:39.260
really takes us through all this.
It's designed for,
the science is behind it,

754
00:43:39.261 --> 00:43:42.170
but it's designed that anyone can read.
It's not technical,

755
00:43:42.350 --> 00:43:43.580
it's made for the person.

756
00:43:43.910 --> 00:43:46.280
And the Nice thing I think about this book as we seem to have got the balance

757
00:43:46.281 --> 00:43:49.490
right,
the pediatricians agree with it and even the naturopathic degree with it.

758
00:43:49.700 --> 00:43:53.270
So the whole balance thing,
and it's full of helpful hints on how to do the kid.

759
00:43:53.271 --> 00:43:54.470
There's chapters and asthma,

760
00:43:54.471 --> 00:43:58.610
obesity and diabetes and many other diseases affect all of us in our life.

761
00:43:59.290 --> 00:44:03.020
Um,
and I'll refer you to the website and let them eat dirt.com.

762
00:44:03.140 --> 00:44:06.020
We put up a bunch of information there if you're interested in this.

763
00:44:06.260 --> 00:44:08.030
And if you're going to ask him about probiotics,

764
00:44:08.031 --> 00:44:10.940
there's a really nice blank just clicking the probiotics and we'll take you to

765
00:44:10.941 --> 00:44:14.540
the clinical studies that show which probiotics work for what disease.

766
00:44:14.541 --> 00:44:16.310
There's a few,
they work,
but most of them they don't.

767
00:44:17.150 --> 00:44:20.630
So I will stand around afterwards and maybe we'll sell a few books and sign

768
00:44:20.631 --> 00:44:24.290
these things.
And so finally,
I guess I want to leave you with a message.

769
00:44:24.620 --> 00:44:26.540
This is Seattle.
It's like Vancouver rains a lot.

770
00:44:26.541 --> 00:44:28.130
I thought there was an appropriate picture here.

771
00:44:28.370 --> 00:44:32.160
We need to let kids be kids experience the world because they have to do that to

772
00:44:32.161 --> 00:44:35.130
pick up their microbes then be healthy.
Thanks a lot.

773
00:44:38.670 --> 00:44:40.770
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

774
00:44:42.760 --> 00:44:47.020
<v 3>so thank you Dr. Finley.
Uh,
we have a few minutes for questions.</v>

775
00:44:47.530 --> 00:44:49.390
Thanks.
This is really interesting.
Um,

776
00:44:49.720 --> 00:44:52.360
so are there any circumstances where you would recommend,
uh,

777
00:44:52.540 --> 00:44:55.480
like an alcohol based sanitizer?
Like if I'm camping or something,

778
00:44:55.481 --> 00:44:59.520
I have no running water.
You know,
maybe I'm,
I'm digging cat holes and stuff.
Yeah.

779
00:44:59.800 --> 00:45:04.320
<v 2>Um,
yeah,
that,
that's the whole hygiene question that if you are,
you know,</v>

780
00:45:04.350 --> 00:45:05.920
a daycare and everyone's squirting,

781
00:45:05.921 --> 00:45:08.470
everybody got diarrhea and things definitely watched the hand.
So,

782
00:45:08.480 --> 00:45:11.950
so this works for,
for the,
the hygiene kind of concept of it.

783
00:45:12.220 --> 00:45:16.750
But just for daily maintenance,
the answer is no,
it doesn't do a tall,
so use it,

784
00:45:16.960 --> 00:45:19.150
you know,
if you're in a hospital setting for example,

785
00:45:19.180 --> 00:45:21.040
there was a reason that they use hand sanitizer there,

786
00:45:21.041 --> 00:45:23.860
but we honestly don't need it here.
Really.
Yeah.

787
00:45:24.080 --> 00:45:28.550
<v 4>Great.
Thank you.
Great question.
Do you foresee the development of a,</v>

788
00:45:28.960 --> 00:45:32.210
uh,
ideal series of,
of um,

789
00:45:32.990 --> 00:45:37.160
biome cocktails or,
or,
or,
uh,
um,

790
00:45:37.760 --> 00:45:41.990
uh,
that are,
that are designed so that a,
you give this,
uh,

791
00:45:42.070 --> 00:45:45.440
within 24 hours of birth,
you give that one was x number of weeks.

792
00:45:45.441 --> 00:45:49.070
You have that one with him x number of months so that um,
uh,

793
00:45:49.200 --> 00:45:53.510
kids will have a,
a idealized,
a biome in the gut.

794
00:45:54.610 --> 00:45:57.760
<v 2>Yeah,
absolutely.
I mean,
I'm going to call it probiotics 2.0 kind of thing.</v>

795
00:45:57.761 --> 00:46:00.460
I cofounded a company in Boston is doing exactly that.

796
00:46:00.461 --> 00:46:03.760
They're doing the vaginal recolonization.
They're thinking about screening.

797
00:46:03.761 --> 00:46:06.700
If you've got risk for asthma or not,
you could then repopulate these things.

798
00:46:07.060 --> 00:46:10.430
The thing about probiotics is that,
that they're,

799
00:46:10.480 --> 00:46:12.850
they're often from the vagina and you're putting them in the gut.

800
00:46:12.880 --> 00:46:13.660
They don't stick.

801
00:46:13.660 --> 00:46:16.420
There's a reason they say you have to take 10 billing and things a date because

802
00:46:16.421 --> 00:46:17.560
they just flushed through you.

803
00:46:17.920 --> 00:46:20.350
So I think in the future it'll be a pill that contains,
you know,

804
00:46:20.351 --> 00:46:22.810
20 different microbes from the gut for the God.

805
00:46:23.110 --> 00:46:25.510
And we know these microbes have this particular benefit.

806
00:46:25.511 --> 00:46:29.860
So we repopulate the whole ecological system with these microbes.
So yeah,

807
00:46:29.861 --> 00:46:30.311
I think,

808
00:46:30.311 --> 00:46:34.540
I think probiotics the future are very exciting and we're still early days on

809
00:46:34.541 --> 00:46:38.050
identifying which microbes are going to give us this particular benefit.
Um,

810
00:46:38.060 --> 00:46:41.790
this field is only really about seven to 10 years old.
So it's,
it's really,
um,

811
00:46:41.980 --> 00:46:42.813
gearing up.

812
00:46:42.910 --> 00:46:45.880
But I think we're going to see major changes in this area and it's a lot easier

813
00:46:45.881 --> 00:46:49.000
to give a probiotic then.
Well,
we can't do gene therapy now,
for example.

814
00:46:49.001 --> 00:46:50.920
So I think we're going to see a lot of that.
Yeah.

815
00:46:51.460 --> 00:46:52.540
<v 3>So my question is,</v>

816
00:46:52.541 --> 00:46:55.900
do you have any advice for adults with some of the conditions you mentioned?

817
00:46:57.980 --> 00:47:02.090
<v 2>Yeah,
I mean a lot of the similar concepts apply.
So diet is a major thing.
Um,</v>

818
00:47:02.180 --> 00:47:05.030
and um,
I think things like asthma,

819
00:47:05.031 --> 00:47:07.250
that's because it's early life immune system either.

820
00:47:07.310 --> 00:47:11.510
I haven't seen any data that later in life he effect you could affect asthma.
Um,

821
00:47:11.780 --> 00:47:14.750
but things like IBD for example,
obesity,
diabetes,

822
00:47:14.751 --> 00:47:18.500
there's some neat stuff coming out.
Even things like cancer,
chemotherapy,

823
00:47:18.501 --> 00:47:21.770
there's some beautiful studies coming out now that they can tell whether you

824
00:47:21.771 --> 00:47:24.920
respond to chemo or not depending on what microbes you have and they actually

825
00:47:24.921 --> 00:47:28.010
predict with these things.
So see,
I'm toyed with writing a book,
you know,

826
00:47:28.020 --> 00:47:30.850
the other end of life as age and I've been studying this a lot,

827
00:47:30.851 --> 00:47:35.230
but there are certainly,
um,
you know,
probiotics not going to hurt.

828
00:47:35.500 --> 00:47:37.750
You can take those kinds of things.
I think,
you know,

829
00:47:37.870 --> 00:47:40.750
Diet and exercise is a major component cause both of those influences in

830
00:47:40.751 --> 00:47:44.010
microbes and depends on certain conditions,
you know,

831
00:47:44.380 --> 00:47:46.810
and pay attention the literature because it's coming fast.

832
00:47:46.811 --> 00:47:49.390
There's a lot of stuff coming out,
but you got to filter it and look at,

833
00:47:49.391 --> 00:47:51.960
there's a lot of quackery out there too and do that but,

834
00:47:51.961 --> 00:47:55.060
but it does certainly coming.
Yeah.
Cool.
Thanks.
Yup.

835
00:47:55.950 --> 00:48:00.470
<v 4>Is there any interesting data around a,
like when kids are in daycare,</v>

836
00:48:00.510 --> 00:48:04.760
buses home more versus in growing up in a village with a city?

837
00:48:04.900 --> 00:48:06.310
<v 2>Yeah,
there's certainly is.
Um,</v>

838
00:48:06.380 --> 00:48:09.250
it's interesting that this whole hygiene hypothesis,

839
00:48:09.251 --> 00:48:10.330
the idea where to clean early,

840
00:48:10.331 --> 00:48:15.130
that was discovered by realizing that the younger siblings have less diseases

841
00:48:15.131 --> 00:48:16.900
and stuff when the older ones,
because the older kids,

842
00:48:16.901 --> 00:48:18.280
I brought all this stuff home too.

843
00:48:18.790 --> 00:48:22.270
So there's no data to say that getting infections and kids is good for kids.

844
00:48:22.271 --> 00:48:25.960
Like you don't,
you don't have to get an infection,
but there's no doubt that,

845
00:48:25.961 --> 00:48:28.540
you know,
when a kid hits daycare for then use had done that.
You know,

846
00:48:28.541 --> 00:48:31.590
immediately you're going to have a year of colds and you and your kids are going

847
00:48:31.591 --> 00:48:36.050
to suffer need,
you know,
um,
but yes,
you can see shifts in their microbes.
Um,

848
00:48:36.370 --> 00:48:37.780
the question I'm wondering is,
okay,

849
00:48:37.781 --> 00:48:41.710
so you're a mother and you have a kid by c section and you have mastitis,

850
00:48:41.711 --> 00:48:44.830
she can't breastfeed and you live on the 22nd floor of a condo in an urban

851
00:48:44.831 --> 00:48:49.570
setting and you have no pets and your daycare's down the door,
I'm down the hall,

852
00:48:49.720 --> 00:48:51.910
you know,
I wonder how are these kids going to get,
you know,

853
00:48:51.911 --> 00:48:52.960
sort of normal things.

854
00:48:53.260 --> 00:48:57.190
So Dennis speaking daycare is a good way of mixing up the microbes except when

855
00:48:57.191 --> 00:48:59.430
the infections come.
And that's,
you know,
that's when,
you know,

856
00:48:59.500 --> 00:49:01.630
they just ripped through the daycare.
So yeah,

857
00:49:01.631 --> 00:49:05.020
you and you can certainly tell microbes are real read on the environment.

858
00:49:05.021 --> 00:49:07.930
Like we can tell in the feces whether the family has a dog or not.

859
00:49:08.200 --> 00:49:10.120
Cause you have dog microbes in there.
That's easy to see.

860
00:49:10.121 --> 00:49:13.570
And we can tell what kind of dog it is based on the microbial composition and

861
00:49:13.780 --> 00:49:18.520
that they need to.
But,
um,
so,
so the environment really does influence.
And so,

862
00:49:18.610 --> 00:49:21.470
um,
there,
there's,
there's a lot of studies coming out to daycare,

863
00:49:21.530 --> 00:49:25.060
sort of enhances this whole community exposure to microbes cause you do get

864
00:49:25.150 --> 00:49:27.770
different microbes and if you're just solely staying at home and never seen

865
00:49:27.771 --> 00:49:30.310
other kid.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Neat question.

866
00:49:30.580 --> 00:49:32.440
<v 4>So you didn't show the map but you kind of,</v>

867
00:49:32.530 --> 00:49:35.170
I'm sorry you didn't show the map and you alluded to the fact that there is a

868
00:49:35.171 --> 00:49:39.880
correlation between say obesity rates and demographics and possibly political

869
00:49:40.180 --> 00:49:42.430
inclinations.
I don't like going there.
Maybe,
maybe not,

870
00:49:42.431 --> 00:49:46.960
but I'm kind of curious why that actually is.
Is it because you know,

871
00:49:47.440 --> 00:49:50.530
people in certain parts of the country wash their hands more use hand sanitizer

872
00:49:50.531 --> 00:49:52.300
or is it nutrition or do we not know

873
00:49:52.660 --> 00:49:57.660
<v 2>since your diet and exercise is what the epidemiologists attributed to and um,</v>

874
00:49:58.240 --> 00:50:01.780
major high fat diet and lack of exercise in the southern areas of the states for

875
00:50:01.781 --> 00:50:05.860
example.
And um,
yeah,
that's,
that's what they claim.

876
00:50:06.910 --> 00:50:09.250
I have not seen a hand sander to like,
you know,
just,
you know,

877
00:50:09.251 --> 00:50:11.790
southern US use more or less hand sanitizer in the north.

878
00:50:11.830 --> 00:50:13.750
I don't know about that.
I don't think it's that,

879
00:50:13.751 --> 00:50:17.650
I think it's just the whole environment these people are living in.
Yeah.

880
00:50:18.450 --> 00:50:22.410
<v 4>Thanks very much for your talk.
Um,
I'm uh,
a weight loss surgery,</v>

881
00:50:22.700 --> 00:50:27.700
a patient and I'm very interested to know your opinion on that particular Spec

882
00:50:28.011 --> 00:50:32.840
perspective.
I've had to switch myself to probiotics,
right.
Um,

883
00:50:32.990 --> 00:50:37.590
but you know,
rather,
really any discussion before going into the surgery that um,

884
00:50:37.640 --> 00:50:41.540
you're going to be changing your microbial levels and stuff.

885
00:50:41.541 --> 00:50:42.950
And so I'm very interested enough,

886
00:50:42.951 --> 00:50:45.060
there's like studies out there on that or anything like that.

887
00:50:45.640 --> 00:50:48.360
<v 2>They're just coming on.
I've seen several now raise then,
you know,
from very,</v>

888
00:50:48.361 --> 00:50:51.090
I'd surgery really does affect the microbes cause you're really taking a piece

889
00:50:51.091 --> 00:50:53.310
of the intestine in that sense.
Um,

890
00:50:53.760 --> 00:50:56.610
what that means in terms of health complications down the line.

891
00:50:56.640 --> 00:50:59.280
I have not seen the,
I think it's still early days in that sense,

892
00:50:59.490 --> 00:51:02.500
but there's no doubt you do shift the microbes anytime you do something to the

893
00:51:02.501 --> 00:51:06.420
and test time and,
and you're right.
A lot of the probiotics,
as I say,

894
00:51:06.421 --> 00:51:09.240
they can't hurt.
They seem to help digestion and things.
And there's your,

895
00:51:09.270 --> 00:51:10.770
you know,
punk Titus for example.

896
00:51:10.771 --> 00:51:13.290
There's some nice data that probiotic seem to actually decrease that,

897
00:51:13.291 --> 00:51:16.950
for example.
So,
yeah.
Yeah.
Okay.
Yeah.
Thanks.

898
00:51:17.390 --> 00:51:19.550
<v 4>I'm wondering about probiotics,</v>

899
00:51:19.551 --> 00:51:23.000
including a small number of identified microbes versus broad spectrum,

900
00:51:23.001 --> 00:51:26.780
natural exposure.
How many different microbes do we have?

901
00:51:26.781 --> 00:51:30.650
How many different microbes does someone who's living in natural conditions and

902
00:51:30.651 --> 00:51:31.610
the Amazon have?

903
00:51:31.880 --> 00:51:36.880
And what are the chances that we can identify the microbes that matter so that,

904
00:51:37.150 --> 00:51:38.580
<v 2>oh,
where the research is right now,</v>

905
00:51:38.581 --> 00:51:42.270
there's about a thousand generally split a thousand species of microbes in your

906
00:51:42.271 --> 00:51:44.760
gut.
And each person I said is different.
There's about three,

907
00:51:44.761 --> 00:51:48.540
300 or so in your mouth that are different.
The skin,

908
00:51:48.541 --> 00:51:52.320
there's probably about a hundred or so different ones.
Um,

909
00:51:52.650 --> 00:51:54.060
with respect to the Amazon and things,

910
00:51:54.061 --> 00:51:57.420
there's been some various who studies dunning on the microbes of these people

911
00:51:57.421 --> 00:52:01.300
have had very little exposure to the outside world.
And um,

912
00:52:01.530 --> 00:52:04.440
their microbes are very different,
but they're dying is very different to,

913
00:52:04.730 --> 00:52:06.960
and actually one anthropologist was so convinced he did it.

914
00:52:06.961 --> 00:52:09.750
He gave himself a fecal transfer with this primitive,

915
00:52:09.751 --> 00:52:11.580
if you want to call it that theses.

916
00:52:11.581 --> 00:52:15.270
And he just got severe diarrhea and he got into real trouble in that sense.

917
00:52:15.271 --> 00:52:18.330
So that experiment didn't work.
Um,
but you're right.

918
00:52:18.331 --> 00:52:22.560
So the idea is Kenyan biobank really,
you know,
can we save the good ones?
Okay,

919
00:52:22.561 --> 00:52:23.251
these ones are good.

920
00:52:23.251 --> 00:52:25.920
We need these things and bio and there's groups that are certainly working at

921
00:52:25.921 --> 00:52:30.010
that.
And that's really where the research is right now to,
you know,
you know,

922
00:52:30.600 --> 00:52:33.270
biobank has this diversity of these microbes,
you know,

923
00:52:33.271 --> 00:52:35.610
and try and figure which ones are important.
Yeah,

924
00:52:36.900 --> 00:52:39.100
<v 5>thanks for the talk.
It was very enjoyable.
Thanks.</v>

925
00:52:39.600 --> 00:52:44.490
So my first question is how literally should we take the title of your book in

926
00:52:44.491 --> 00:52:45.324
the following sense?

927
00:52:45.600 --> 00:52:49.890
So my spouse was a big proponent of home vegetable gardens from my daughter when

928
00:52:49.891 --> 00:52:53.280
she was very young and she seems to be doing very well now and good.
Um,

929
00:52:53.670 --> 00:52:56.820
so like is there a benefit to actually eating fruits,

930
00:52:56.821 --> 00:53:00.120
vegetables that are like semi unwashed and so forth.
Um,

931
00:53:00.240 --> 00:53:03.780
and my second question was related to one of the maps you showed about asthma.

932
00:53:03.781 --> 00:53:06.930
I look like globally.
It was a western world problem except for Brazil.

933
00:53:07.180 --> 00:53:11.470
<v 2>Oh,
well we'll do that.
Brazil is a great story.
Yeah.
Okay.
So title,
I mean,</v>

934
00:53:12.400 --> 00:53:16.000
let kids see the microbes that are found within the third sometimes to help

935
00:53:16.001 --> 00:53:18.970
replenish.
And we'll never make a title right.
So it's a bit tongue in cheek,

936
00:53:19.140 --> 00:53:22.970
you know,
Hillary,
a best seller to that.
So it's a bit tongue and cheek.
Um,

937
00:53:23.390 --> 00:53:25.060
I think we can safely say that,
you know,
if,

938
00:53:25.061 --> 00:53:26.760
if a kid picks up a handful of dirt today,

939
00:53:26.820 --> 00:53:29.760
it's much safer than a handful of dirt.
A hundred years ago he had cholera,

940
00:53:29.761 --> 00:53:34.110
smallpox,
you know,
all these,
um,
other nasty things.
So it's safer in that sense.

941
00:53:34.410 --> 00:53:39.080
And,
um,
but it,
you know,
I,
a lot of that is starting to show that,
you know,

942
00:53:39.200 --> 00:53:42.390
you know,
I had as a kid,
you pull carrots,
old scrape the dirt off,
most of it,

943
00:53:42.391 --> 00:53:44.340
they just chew on it,
right.
And you can taste the dirt and things.

944
00:53:44.341 --> 00:53:47.250
You're getting good microbial exposure there.
That's probably good for them.

945
00:53:47.530 --> 00:53:50.280
You know,
say if a kid's,
you know,
let the good play in the sandbox,

946
00:53:50.310 --> 00:53:53.250
unless there's cat feces there and then don't cause that has parasites in it for

947
00:53:53.251 --> 00:53:56.650
example,
or like the Floria House,
that's okay,
but not the subway station.

948
00:53:56.651 --> 00:54:00.090
That's probably not okay kind of thing.
So,
so it's a balance.
Um,

949
00:54:00.750 --> 00:54:03.750
I've not seen any studies have actually ramming dirt down a kid's mouth and

950
00:54:03.751 --> 00:54:06.930
saying,
you know,
this isn't good for you or not.
I mean,

951
00:54:06.960 --> 00:54:10.860
more the unwashed carrot variety.
Right?
Yeah.
I think that's really good.
And that,

952
00:54:10.920 --> 00:54:14.400
that's another way of microbial exposure.
The Brazil story.
So you picked it up.

953
00:54:14.430 --> 00:54:17.250
There's um,
um,
Brazil was bright red for asthma to,

954
00:54:17.251 --> 00:54:18.440
and the question is why cause it,

955
00:54:18.510 --> 00:54:20.840
you don't associate with being a fully developed country gap.

956
00:54:21.400 --> 00:54:24.600
Turns out in Brazil,
c-sections are a range.

957
00:54:24.630 --> 00:54:29.630
So about 80% of people in Brazil gets c-sections and about 95% of the women in

958
00:54:29.701 --> 00:54:33.360
Rio de Janeiro and get c-sections.
Part of that is it's trendy.

959
00:54:33.361 --> 00:54:35.910
It's like cool to have your little bikini scar kind of thing.

960
00:54:36.150 --> 00:54:40.110
But also the other part is the obstetricians are unionized and they're union

961
00:54:40.111 --> 00:54:42.750
says you don't do night call.
So if you want to deliver a kid,

962
00:54:42.751 --> 00:54:44.010
you've got to do it during daylight hours.

963
00:54:44.011 --> 00:54:45.990
So I don't have to get up at nine deliver this thing.

964
00:54:46.350 --> 00:54:49.890
So it's really going to various who follow what happens to all of these kids

965
00:54:49.891 --> 00:54:52.790
that are born by c section.
You know,
cause we're going to see it,
see the cohort,

966
00:54:52.791 --> 00:54:53.610
some of them.

967
00:54:53.610 --> 00:54:56.420
And so there's a big movement now to try and convince these obstetrician then

968
00:54:56.430 --> 00:54:57.220
maybe kids,

969
00:54:57.220 --> 00:55:00.030
maybe you do have to get up in the night and do a normal vaginal delivery

970
00:55:00.031 --> 00:55:01.740
sometimes for the health of these kids.

971
00:55:02.340 --> 00:55:05.230
I don't know if that's why Brazil is so high.
Um,
but that,

972
00:55:05.250 --> 00:55:07.650
I mean we know that CSX has really increased asthma rates.

973
00:55:07.651 --> 00:55:10.860
I'm sure that contributes to it.
Yeah.
Thanks.
Okay,
thanks a lot.

974
00:55:11.390 --> 00:55:15.890
<v 6>Hi.
You talked a lot about,
um,
health and eating and,
um,</v>

975
00:55:15.891 --> 00:55:19.730
that you can eat healthy,
you to,
uh,
improve,
uh,

976
00:55:20.210 --> 00:55:21.710
I dunno the outcomes and so forth,

977
00:55:22.040 --> 00:55:27.040
but are there specific foods that are linked to healthy microbes that you should

978
00:55:27.621 --> 00:55:29.580
eat more of other than just hello?

979
00:55:29.950 --> 00:55:33.850
<v 2>Yes,
and the answer,
it's all the ones that grow on the picture.
It is the plants.</v>

980
00:55:33.851 --> 00:55:38.650
It's the legumes,
the nuts,
the,
um,
just the highly complex,

981
00:55:38.740 --> 00:55:43.450
unprocessed foods,
as I was saying,
you know,
white sugar,
white,
white,
white flour,

982
00:55:43.720 --> 00:55:44.560
processed meats.

983
00:55:44.561 --> 00:55:47.830
These are at the other end of the spectrum in terms of driving obesity type

984
00:55:47.831 --> 00:55:51.670
microbes.
Um,
and like I say,

985
00:55:51.671 --> 00:55:54.430
the stuff that's being done with day to go personalized diets showing which

986
00:55:54.431 --> 00:55:58.330
foods are good and bad for it,
for each person.
Um,
Delis speaking,

987
00:55:58.930 --> 00:56:02.470
the moral of the story is,
you know,
it's,
it's,
it's,
it's an old story,

988
00:56:02.471 --> 00:56:04.720
but now we know it's the microbes,
not just because he used to be,

989
00:56:04.721 --> 00:56:07.390
you'd get your lettuce because it gives you fight amens and things.
Now,
no.

990
00:56:07.420 --> 00:56:10.900
Now we also show that actually twists your microbes in a much more beneficial

991
00:56:10.901 --> 00:56:13.900
way.
So I think the whole western diet is,

992
00:56:13.901 --> 00:56:16.990
is the worst site we can have for microbes when you actually look at it.

993
00:56:17.320 --> 00:56:19.630
And the better diets are the,
you know,

994
00:56:19.631 --> 00:56:24.520
the more plant and legume based type things.
People did a lot.
Um,
um,
you know,

995
00:56:24.521 --> 00:56:27.670
beans and things like this.
There's a book called the blue zones,

996
00:56:27.671 --> 00:56:30.010
which is areas in the world where people live forever.

997
00:56:30.011 --> 00:56:33.370
Like since centurions a hundred years,
2% turns 105 years.

998
00:56:33.730 --> 00:56:37.450
And what these people have in common is they have social contacts.

999
00:56:37.451 --> 00:56:39.580
Their 80 year old daughter looks after their hundred year old parent.

1000
00:56:39.581 --> 00:56:42.790
They have families or they,
um,
they also have exercise.

1001
00:56:42.791 --> 00:56:46.030
They've walked down to the town center to play cards with their buddies or

1002
00:56:46.031 --> 00:56:49.780
whatever all the time and they don't eat very much red meat and need a lot of

1003
00:56:49.781 --> 00:56:50.890
legumes and things.

1004
00:56:50.920 --> 00:56:53.560
And they know they have a pig roast once a year for new year's.
That's okay,

1005
00:56:53.561 --> 00:56:55.810
but you don't have to eat as much meat type thing.

1006
00:56:56.200 --> 00:56:58.270
And that is a trend of the seven areas around the world.

1007
00:56:58.271 --> 00:56:59.320
That's what they all have in common.

1008
00:57:00.040 --> 00:57:02.950
So I think Diane's going to see a major resurgence as we realize,
you know,

1009
00:57:03.010 --> 00:57:06.370
some of the other reasons why you actually need to think about what you eat,

1010
00:57:06.940 --> 00:57:08.260
but for sure,
um,

1011
00:57:08.470 --> 00:57:11.740
what you think of a healthy eating that's actually gives you a healthy microbes.

1012
00:57:11.860 --> 00:57:13.840
The data shows that.
Yeah.
Thank you.

1013
00:57:14.590 --> 00:57:15.190
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

1014
00:57:15.190 --> 00:57:18.470
<v 5>a very interesting talk.
Thank you very much for coming today.
Uh,</v>

1015
00:57:18.590 --> 00:57:23.140
I have a 13 month old,
so that's why I love it.
Mainly focused on this right now.

1016
00:57:23.530 --> 00:57:27.460
Um,
the one quick comment I heard,
uh,

1017
00:57:27.490 --> 00:57:30.210
no mention of one of the things that was highlighted when we were sort of

1018
00:57:30.220 --> 00:57:33.200
preparing for her arrival,
which was a new focus,

1019
00:57:33.220 --> 00:57:38.080
relatively new focus on early skin to skin contact with the mother.
Um,

1020
00:57:38.110 --> 00:57:40.510
you mentioned that sort of vaginal swabs,
but I didn't,

1021
00:57:40.511 --> 00:57:41.980
I was a little surprised not to hear that mentioned.

1022
00:57:42.720 --> 00:57:45.100
<v 2>Well,
most of the benefits,
there's some on the skin,</v>

1023
00:57:45.101 --> 00:57:47.350
but not as many as one of the giant of,
for example.

1024
00:57:47.351 --> 00:57:50.350
So the studies are unclear right now.
So far,
you know,

1025
00:57:50.351 --> 00:57:53.590
should you immediate latch on the breast for microbial exposure kind of thing.

1026
00:57:53.890 --> 00:57:57.940
Um,
a lot of people are starting to think that,
but the dad is not strong yet.

1027
00:57:58.330 --> 00:58:01.720
<v 5>Okay.
Yeah.
Um,
what I really wanted to ask is,
uh,</v>

1028
00:58:01.721 --> 00:58:04.150
I had a parent recently tell me,
uh,

1029
00:58:04.210 --> 00:58:08.170
that the eating the same thing with the child was a negative for the child in

1030
00:58:08.171 --> 00:58:11.920
terms of tooth decay because our floor was so different.
And like,
uh,

1031
00:58:12.020 --> 00:58:16.200
if I took a bite of something that she was taking,
then a bite of,
uh,

1032
00:58:16.280 --> 00:58:19.300
like really surprised me and I was hoping you would

1033
00:58:22.190 --> 00:58:23.760
get first shower shower.
Yeah.

1034
00:58:28.050 --> 00:58:30.450
So no evidence you've heard of ever just support that.

1035
00:58:30.720 --> 00:58:35.520
And one of the other things I've wondered is,
uh,
is there a point at which,
uh,

1036
00:58:35.640 --> 00:58:39.420
it becomes less important to have this sort of,
you know,
to let them eat dirt?

1037
00:58:39.870 --> 00:58:42.260
<v 2>Yeah.
At least five years of age is kind of,</v>

1038
00:58:42.310 --> 00:58:46.470
then it obviously influences all of us at all ages,
but really the,

1039
00:58:46.540 --> 00:58:50.110
I call the book ends of life zero five and the 65 plus.

1040
00:58:50.140 --> 00:58:53.500
That's when the microbes seem to have an even more,
um,
then middle life,

1041
00:58:53.501 --> 00:58:57.160
it's things like diabetes and obesity,
and then that's just standard.
Um,
uh,

1042
00:58:57.490 --> 00:59:00.100
well physical being type things that they seem to play a role,

1043
00:59:00.310 --> 00:59:02.770
but the early life because you're setting up and the later life,

1044
00:59:02.771 --> 00:59:05.380
I think immune system goes wonky in the bunk,
go wonky.
So

1045
00:59:06.110 --> 00:59:08.510
<v 5>awesome.
So I've still got some time with her then.
Yeah,
absolutely.
Yeah,</v>

1046
00:59:08.511 --> 00:59:10.250
there's still hope.
Thanks.

1047
00:59:11.280 --> 00:59:12.113
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1048
00:59:12.970 --> 00:59:14.640
<v 5>All right.
So thank you very much again.</v>

1049
00:59:16.020 --> 00:59:16.531
<v 1>Thank you very much.</v>

1050
00:59:16.531 --> 00:59:21.480
[inaudible].
