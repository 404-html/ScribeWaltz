00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:12.560
So hello and welcome and a special welcome to our guest today,

2
00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:14.630
Helen Scales and Aaron John Gregory.

3
00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.040
Helen Scales is a British marine biologist,

4
00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:23.090
a broadcaster and writer professor scale swam all the way over here from

5
00:00:23.091 --> 00:00:27.860
Cambridge University where she teaches marine biology in science writing serves

6
00:00:27.861 --> 00:00:32.000
as a scientific advisor to the marine conservation charity.
See Changers.

7
00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:37.780
You may know her from her BBC radio programs such as inside science,

8
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.730
shared planet outlook and weekend.

9
00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:44.750
Her previous books include spirals in time,

10
00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:49.810
the secret life and curious afterlife of seashells and Poseidon Steed,

11
00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.320
the story of sea horses from myth to reality.
Her new book

12
00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:00.770
I have the shoal is an attempt to unhitch fish from their reputation as slimy

13
00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.910
simple minded creatures and reveal their mesmerizing and complex lives.

14
00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.530
The illustrator of the book is Aaron John Gregory.
In addition to this book,

15
00:01:09.531 --> 00:01:12.010
Aron's illustration work includes God,

16
00:01:12.011 --> 00:01:15.770
Zillow range across time or IDW comics,

17
00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:17.270
furry logic,

18
00:01:17.271 --> 00:01:21.650
the physics of animal life and the book for the Smithsonian called Narwhal

19
00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:26.680
revealing and Arctic legend which accompanied the reason exhibit in DC and Erin

20
00:01:26.951 --> 00:01:29.560
also with the illustrator for one of Alan's previous books.

21
00:01:29.561 --> 00:01:31.840
So trying to liberty you.
Thank you.
That

22
00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:34.340
<v 2>very much.
Thank you so much for that lovely introduction.</v>

23
00:01:34.341 --> 00:01:37.940
And thank you all for coming along this afternoon.
Of anyone who's listening,
uh,

24
00:01:37.941 --> 00:01:42.880
online.
Um,
my name is Hernan Scales and yeah,
I'm a marine biologist.
Uh,

25
00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.050
and just,
just to clear things up right from the start,

26
00:01:45.051 --> 00:01:49.850
I often do get asked about my name,
uh,
and just,

27
00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.760
just make sure it is my real name.
Um,

28
00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:54.200
but I'm not the only marine biologists with a cool name.

29
00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:56.840
I have a couple of other favorites.
There's teddy girl.

30
00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:01.240
He was at an American at theologist,
uh,
about a hundred years ago.
Um,

31
00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:02.180
this guy's still around.

32
00:02:02.181 --> 00:02:07.181
Stephen Paddock actually is nearby where we are now in Monterey Bay Aquarium

33
00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:10.190
Research Institute.
He studies jellyfish as you can see on his t shirt.

34
00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:15.410
And this is,
uh,
one of my absolute favorite and marine biologists,
marine fish.

35
00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:17.810
And we're going to come back to her later.
Um,

36
00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.920
it's a real pleasure to be here today.
Um,
especially because,
um,

37
00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:25.610
this is the first opportunity I've had to appear alongside,
um,
Aaron,

38
00:02:25.611 --> 00:02:28.250
John Gregory,
who was become a dear friend.

39
00:02:28.251 --> 00:02:30.680
But basically we've been working together for a couple of years now.

40
00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:32.320
I'm on my books.
Um,

41
00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.940
he's been bringing to life these wonderful creatures that I write about.

42
00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.240
So today's the first opportunity we've had to actually appear together and to

43
00:02:38.241 --> 00:02:42.410
talk about our different sides of the,
of,
of this,
um,
collaboration.

44
00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.230
Um,
so what we're gonna do is I'm going to introduce the book,

45
00:02:45.231 --> 00:02:47.780
tell you a little bit about what I've written about,
um,

46
00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:50.090
go into a few of the stories I tell,

47
00:02:50.091 --> 00:02:55.091
and then we're going to hear from a about what he does to produce beautiful

48
00:02:55.131 --> 00:02:57.590
artwork.
I should go back to that first slide actually.

49
00:02:57.591 --> 00:03:01.480
Cause this is an image that sadly we were going to have on the front and the

50
00:03:01.481 --> 00:03:03.250
back cover of the book.
This is the front cover.

51
00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:05.440
This is going to be the back cover,
which is very beautiful hills,

52
00:03:05.441 --> 00:03:07.210
has a t shirt with.
Um,

53
00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:11.200
but my publisher's insisted on putting words on the back of my book instead of

54
00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:16.120
beautiful pictures.
So this is what it should looked like.
Um,
so here we go.

55
00:03:16.121 --> 00:03:19.960
So yeah,
I have the shoal.
Um,
the fish watch this guide to life,

56
00:03:19.961 --> 00:03:20.860
the oceans and everything.

57
00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:25.120
The idea behind the book really is to bring to life this group of animals that I

58
00:03:25.121 --> 00:03:28.980
think kind of get a bit of a raw deal.
They,
um,

59
00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:32.260
they inhabit the oceans,
which is the biggest living space on the planet.

60
00:03:32.261 --> 00:03:36.160
It's something like 90% of the available biosphere,

61
00:03:36.161 --> 00:03:39.040
the living place for creatures to occupy,

62
00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:44.290
90% of the space on our planet is ocean.
And I would argue that the,

63
00:03:44.291 --> 00:03:47.560
oh,
the fish really reign supreme in this enormous round,

64
00:03:47.561 --> 00:03:50.080
certainly amongst the vertebrates.
So,
um,

65
00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:53.080
there are about 30,000 species official life today,

66
00:03:53.081 --> 00:03:55.720
which is the same number as all of the other vertebrates put together.

67
00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:00.820
So 30,000 fish,
but also 30,000 mammals,
amphibians,

68
00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:03.280
birds,
reptiles,
all put together.

69
00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:07.390
So there's an awful lot of fish and they get up to some incredible things down

70
00:04:07.391 --> 00:04:08.051
beneath the waves.

71
00:04:08.051 --> 00:04:12.280
They come in all sorts of shapes and sizes and they do some pretty awesome
stuff.

72
00:04:12.281 --> 00:04:14.870
So just to give you an idea,
some of my favorites,

73
00:04:14.871 --> 00:04:16.390
a little run down of some of my favorite fish.

74
00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:21.460
We have the Greenland shock a recently discovered that this guy lives for 500

75
00:04:21.461 --> 00:04:25.930
years or can do a longest lived vertebra.
It on the planets putting incredible,

76
00:04:25.931 --> 00:04:29.980
they live under the Arctic ice.
Uh,
they hunt polar bears.
Um,
they,

77
00:04:29.981 --> 00:04:33.870
the hearts beat five times a minute.
It's pretty crazy things.
Um,

78
00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:37.100
and they're huge.
They're about I think,
eight meters long.
So pretty huge things.

79
00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:41.770
Here's the words,
world's smallest fish.
Uh,
it doesn't even have a common name.

80
00:04:41.771 --> 00:04:45.730
It's called Peter crypsis pro genetic.
Uh,
this is at full grown.
Uh,

81
00:04:45.731 --> 00:04:48.070
they live in the peat swamps of Borneo.

82
00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:50.530
So fish can be very small and that can be huge.
And the for ages,

83
00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:55.000
I think these guys probably only live for a couple of weeks.
Um,
and yeah,

84
00:04:55.001 --> 00:04:57.760
and fish do some extraordinary things,

85
00:04:57.761 --> 00:05:01.150
which we're just really beginning to learn about through technologies that are

86
00:05:01.151 --> 00:05:04.930
helping us to see into the depths and to track their,
their lives.

87
00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:08.290
And one example I love to give is the Bluefin tuna.

88
00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:11.920
The here in California has quite a good example to give because it was kind of

89
00:05:11.921 --> 00:05:14.830
local,
at least for part of its life.
So the Bluefin tuna,

90
00:05:14.831 --> 00:05:18.220
this particular species from the North Pacific is born off the coast of Japan

91
00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:21.040
and they feed off the coast of California.
Did they come over here?

92
00:05:21.041 --> 00:05:25.750
And they make this incredible journey.
And we know about this because of the,

93
00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:27.670
we have satellite tracking technology,

94
00:05:27.671 --> 00:05:31.690
which can now be small enough to stick a tag onto a fish and track where it
goes.

95
00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:36.280
And,
and here's just one example of one particular tuner that underwent,

96
00:05:36.281 --> 00:05:40.000
this was born in Japan under one to this migration,
uh,
to California.

97
00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:42.760
If then went back to Japan to spawn itself.

98
00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:46.120
And then the tag kept going and it came all the way back to California.

99
00:05:46.121 --> 00:05:49.870
So over the course of just 20 months,
it's migrated 40,000 kilometers,

100
00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:53.800
which is the equivalent of the entire circumference of the planets,

101
00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:54.700
which is amazing.

102
00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:59.180
So fish aren't just wandering around randomly through the oceans.
They are,

103
00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:04.010
they are undergoing journeys to find places they need to be for different

104
00:06:04.011 --> 00:06:07.310
resources,
um,
and navigating in very smart ways,

105
00:06:07.311 --> 00:06:10.670
which was still only just learning about how they make these great journeys and

106
00:06:10.671 --> 00:06:13.850
know where they're going.
Um,
so we extraordinary things,

107
00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:18.140
but fish don't all swim huge distances.
Um,

108
00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:22.520
some of them tend to stay put.
Now I'm gonna show you a little video clip that I,

109
00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:26.900
um,
I shot a couple of years ago.
Hopefully it's going to work in Fiji.

110
00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:27.973
Let's try again,

111
00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:33.140
<v 3>just a really simple little underwater camera.
My photography skills.
Great.</v>

112
00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:34.890
I was interested in this fish here,

113
00:06:34.891 --> 00:06:39.780
which is a trigger fish and there was just lots of colorful fish from you around

114
00:06:39.781 --> 00:06:40.710
and I thought,
well this is awesome.

115
00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:42.740
<v 2>Lovely.
Um,</v>

116
00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:45.800
and it did take me a little while to realize there's another fish in this

117
00:06:45.801 --> 00:06:48.770
picture.
Um,
but she can't have first seen.

118
00:06:48.771 --> 00:06:52.100
It's really not too clear in this picture anyway,
but just to give you a hint,

119
00:06:52.101 --> 00:06:56.510
it's down here.
Um,
and it's a stone fish and again,

120
00:06:56.511 --> 00:06:59.630
you kind of ICAK closer and took some more shots of it.
Um,

121
00:06:59.631 --> 00:07:01.430
it is a bit clearer on the monitor then on the screen,

122
00:07:01.431 --> 00:07:04.290
but just to give you a clue,
there's an eye here and there was a mouse.

123
00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:10.280
These are incredibly well camouflaged fish.
Um,
it's one of those,

124
00:07:10.281 --> 00:07:14.240
I mean I've,
I call the book the fish watchers guide to life,

125
00:07:14.241 --> 00:07:15.021
the oceans and everything.

126
00:07:15.021 --> 00:07:17.810
Cause one thing I want to do is encourage people to go and watch fish and see

127
00:07:17.811 --> 00:07:19.310
them and appreciate them in the wild.

128
00:07:19.311 --> 00:07:22.700
And you get like super high points for spotting one of these guys because

129
00:07:22.701 --> 00:07:26.080
they're so hard to pick out when you do.
You're like,
yeah.
Um,

130
00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:30.810
I've seen that the impossible to see fish.
Um,
Ada,
you've,

131
00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:33.970
you've had some up close encounters with these guys.
Yeah.
Yeah.

132
00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:37.480
<v 4>Um,
so years ago I used to own a tropical fish store,</v>

133
00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:40.240
so Fisher kind of been a part of my life.
Um,

134
00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:43.660
which is interesting that Helen didn't notice it at first,

135
00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:47.140
which is a little dangerous because some of you might know this is actually one

136
00:07:47.141 --> 00:07:50.230
of those lethal venomous fish on the planet.

137
00:07:50.890 --> 00:07:54.410
And if she were to say kind of rest your,

138
00:07:54.411 --> 00:07:58.330
you put your hand down on that rock,
these guys can kill you.
And like five,

139
00:07:58.331 --> 00:08:02.020
10 minutes,
there's no,
there's no like antivenom.
There's no like,
hey,

140
00:08:02.021 --> 00:08:07.021
let's get to the hospital or anything compared to Scorpion fish and lion fish,

141
00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:11.970
which would ruin your day if you had like an allergic reaction to them can

142
00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:15.250
really ruin your day.
These guys would would take you out.

143
00:08:15.310 --> 00:08:19.330
And so when I want a tropical fish door,
surprising you could buy these,

144
00:08:19.690 --> 00:08:20.530
it doesn't pet.

145
00:08:21.340 --> 00:08:25.930
And so I had one on the front counter of the store and the tank about Yay big,

146
00:08:26.050 --> 00:08:27.370
a cylinder kind of hexagon,

147
00:08:27.970 --> 00:08:31.780
just enough space for a couple of inches of gravel around him and he would just

148
00:08:31.781 --> 00:08:33.280
bury himself in the gravel.

149
00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:37.480
And so customers would come up and he'd see this empty tube and you know what's

150
00:08:37.481 --> 00:08:41.490
in that tank?
When I owned the tropical fish store,
I was pretty young.
Disclaimer,

151
00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:44.590
will the 23 so I thought stuff like this was super cool,

152
00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:48.130
I want to get well and I grab a feeder goldfish and I throw it in the tube and

153
00:08:48.610 --> 00:08:53.610
the gravel would just erupt and these things would attack and hit their food in

154
00:08:54.941 --> 00:08:59.250
a of like milliseconds.
It's gun gunshot quick and you know,

155
00:08:59.310 --> 00:09:01.830
goldfish or disappear.
There'd be some scales,
you know,

156
00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:04.410
floating about and then people will be blown away.

157
00:09:04.590 --> 00:09:06.240
And then I go ahead and tell him like,
and by the way,

158
00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:09.820
if you were to put your hand,
in fact they would kill you.
It was just always,

159
00:09:09.970 --> 00:09:14.660
you know,
blow people's minds.
But yeah,
he's,
he's a pretty,
pretty cool fish.

160
00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:15.733
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

161
00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:19.120
There's this really cool that you say that they hide and then basically want to

162
00:09:19.121 --> 00:09:20.950
just grab the food that comes close to them,

163
00:09:20.951 --> 00:09:24.070
whether it's a gold fish in a tank or one of those fish swimming around.
Um,

164
00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:26.080
so a completely different strategy to those tuna,

165
00:09:26.081 --> 00:09:28.450
which are swimming miles and miles and miles to find that food.

166
00:09:28.510 --> 00:09:30.550
These guys just sit and wait.
Um,

167
00:09:30.551 --> 00:09:34.840
so I guess my point is that fish just have very different strategies to survive

168
00:09:34.841 --> 00:09:39.000
and thrive and the oceans to find their food and,
and get the stuff they need.
Um,

169
00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:43.060
and they did some pretty pretty wacky stuff.
So,
wait.
So the one,

170
00:09:43.090 --> 00:09:47.320
a couple of things that I'm trying to do in the book,
um,
his boss,
some of the,

171
00:09:47.430 --> 00:09:49.870
the really ingrained myths that we have about fish,

172
00:09:50.020 --> 00:09:53.710
which I do think puts a barrier between us and them in times of understanding

173
00:09:53.711 --> 00:09:57.790
them as wildlife.
I want people to appreciate these things as,
as beautiful,

174
00:09:57.820 --> 00:10:02.680
fascinating creatures and not just as food or as dcs,
slimy,
smelly,
boring things.

175
00:10:03.430 --> 00:10:06.970
And I think this is one reason why we do kind of have this distance with fish

176
00:10:07.060 --> 00:10:10.240
compared to other vertebrates with birds and mammals is this idea that they have

177
00:10:10.241 --> 00:10:12.910
really terrible memories.
Like the three second memory thing,

178
00:10:12.911 --> 00:10:15.820
I don't know if you've come across this and when Ms. Seven seconds for Goldfish,

179
00:10:15.850 --> 00:10:18.670
like,
you know,
swimming around his bowl and oh,
it's okay.

180
00:10:18.671 --> 00:10:21.750
I don't remember what happened last time round.
Um,

181
00:10:21.820 --> 00:10:23.440
and this is really deeply ingrained,

182
00:10:23.470 --> 00:10:26.920
not just doing the kind of public consciousness,
but within science as well.
Like,

183
00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:31.030
um,
it's taken scientists a long time to figure actually even the fish,

184
00:10:31.031 --> 00:10:34.480
I've got reasonably small brains to their body size.

185
00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:38.620
That doesn't rule out them actually having signs of,

186
00:10:38.621 --> 00:10:41.980
of what we might consider it to be higher intelligence and the ability to solve

187
00:10:41.981 --> 00:10:44.650
problems,
to memorize things and,
and uh,

188
00:10:44.651 --> 00:10:47.350
and do stuff that maybe at first we wouldn't expect.

189
00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:51.610
So I've got a couple of examples of fish that I think helped to bust this myth

190
00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:56.260
myth about them being kind of small minded,
kind of dumb creatures.
Um,

191
00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:59.230
one of them is this guy,
the frill fin Gobi.

192
00:10:59.231 --> 00:11:02.920
These guys live in the Gulf of Mexico on the,
um,
on the rocky shore.

193
00:11:03.190 --> 00:11:06.520
They hot then habits,
um,
kind of shallow into tidal pools.

194
00:11:07.210 --> 00:11:10.030
And what these guys do is when the tide is high,
they will swim around there.

195
00:11:10.050 --> 00:11:11.650
Any little fish probably about Yay big.

196
00:11:11.950 --> 00:11:15.970
They'll swim around and look at the environment around them and basically

197
00:11:15.971 --> 00:11:19.090
memorize the shape of the seabed and they're working out.

198
00:11:19.091 --> 00:11:21.970
But when the sea level drops,
when the tide goes out,

199
00:11:22.270 --> 00:11:24.220
they'll know where the pockets of water will remain,

200
00:11:24.221 --> 00:11:27.460
where the pools are going to form a,
and this could save their life.

201
00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:29.500
And I'm going to explain this with some,

202
00:11:29.501 --> 00:11:32.020
some really high tech illustrations that I did,

203
00:11:32.021 --> 00:11:34.810
unfortunately didn't get a tech to do these ones.
Um,

204
00:11:34.811 --> 00:11:39.490
so no expense has been set at all with this illustration I made of the leaping

205
00:11:39.491 --> 00:11:42.790
gobies.
So,
um,
here we go.
So the c level is coming down.

206
00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:47.080
We've got our goby in the blue fish here and our Predator is this lovely

207
00:11:47.390 --> 00:11:48.820
activists.
Um,

208
00:11:48.890 --> 00:11:52.710
the times coming down and what he doesn't want to do is end up in a pool,
uh,

209
00:11:52.750 --> 00:11:56.770
stuck a predator.
So what does he do?
So he can jump to safety,

210
00:11:57.040 --> 00:12:00.700
but he needs to know which way to jump isn't want to jump out on land.

211
00:12:00.730 --> 00:12:04.810
That would be pretty bad for him.
But basically they have,

212
00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:07.570
because they've memorized the shape of their environment,

213
00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:10.630
they know exactly the right direction and the distance to jump and they will do

214
00:12:10.631 --> 00:12:14.740
that,
um,
when they need to and they will get away to safety.
Um,

215
00:12:14.770 --> 00:12:18.180
which is pretty cool.
And even more cool is the fact that,
um,

216
00:12:18.250 --> 00:12:20.350
the scientists who studied this then thought,
well,

217
00:12:20.351 --> 00:12:22.360
we'll take them away for a bit and see what happens.

218
00:12:22.690 --> 00:12:24.730
So they've collected these fish up,

219
00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:28.000
kept them in a kind of blank aquarium tank for a couple of weeks,

220
00:12:28.001 --> 00:12:32.290
I think maybe up to a month,
putting them back into their natural environments.

221
00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:34.360
And low and behold they still remember what to do.

222
00:12:34.361 --> 00:12:36.550
And as soon as they get stuck in the wrong pool where the Predator,

223
00:12:36.551 --> 00:12:40.060
they know where to go and how to jump to get this kind of exit route,
uh,

224
00:12:40.061 --> 00:12:44.290
to save their skin.
So,
you know,
these guys definitely are not just,

225
00:12:44.350 --> 00:12:46.930
they're definitely have longer than the three second memory and they have this

226
00:12:46.931 --> 00:12:49.960
spatial mapping,
their heads of,
of what's going on.
And,

227
00:12:50.350 --> 00:12:54.070
and you can see how this has evolved too as if survival strategy so that they

228
00:12:54.071 --> 00:12:56.200
don't end up getting big octopus food.

229
00:12:57.490 --> 00:13:01.870
Now another of my favorite examples of a fish that really shows us,

230
00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:05.500
it's got more smarts than you might imagine are the cleaner wrasse not,

231
00:13:05.501 --> 00:13:07.690
these aren't particularly good pictures is in my focus.
Again,

232
00:13:07.691 --> 00:13:09.550
I'm not a very good photographer yet,

233
00:13:09.790 --> 00:13:12.520
but it's basically this stripey little thing,

234
00:13:12.550 --> 00:13:16.150
a short guy in the front on the left hand side,
black and white.

235
00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:19.360
And then this scan of the left,
the right hand side,

236
00:13:19.570 --> 00:13:23.650
I was taking a picture of this big white fish with black stripes and didn't even

237
00:13:23.651 --> 00:13:27.520
realize that behind,
um,
uh,
was another fish being clean.

238
00:13:27.521 --> 00:13:31.300
So the cleaner ras you find on coral reefs and they play really important role

239
00:13:31.301 --> 00:13:35.950
in the ecosystem because they pick off parasites and dead skin from other fish.

240
00:13:36.430 --> 00:13:36.881
And in fact,

241
00:13:36.881 --> 00:13:40.890
we've shown that if you take cleaner wrasse away from an area of coral reef,
uh,

242
00:13:40.950 --> 00:13:42.710
the official basically get pretty sick,
you know,

243
00:13:42.750 --> 00:13:45.260
they suffer from more diseases and they start getting pretty six.

244
00:13:45.261 --> 00:13:49.210
They need this service to have all these nasty bits and pieces taken off of
them.

245
00:13:49.510 --> 00:13:52.330
Um,
it doesn't just fish the get clean though.

246
00:13:52.331 --> 00:13:54.360
I'm going to show you a little video of these guys are just kind of

247
00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:56.950
<v 3>program to clean</v>

248
00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:03.670
whatever comes along.
Um,
so you can have your teeth done if you want.

249
00:14:07.210 --> 00:14:10.720
Hopefully they're not finding any parasites in them.
But I'm not sure about that.

250
00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:12.960
So yes,
Russell just

251
00:14:14.150 --> 00:14:17.060
<v 2>they will just come in whenever they come across and that are after mainly are</v>

252
00:14:17.061 --> 00:14:20.150
these things couldn't have fired.
I supports the kind of like texts of the sea.

253
00:14:20.151 --> 00:14:23.030
They latch onto fish,
suck their blood for a couple of hours and then drop off.

254
00:14:23.430 --> 00:14:27.590
Fish would much rather have them picked off by a cleaner wrasse.
Um,

255
00:14:27.620 --> 00:14:30.980
but the rest,
I mean,
they will eat thousands of these things a day.

256
00:14:31.050 --> 00:14:33.770
They are constantly,
constantly feeding the fish,

257
00:14:33.771 --> 00:14:37.070
coming to their cleaning stations,
hundreds of them each day.
Um,

258
00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:41.730
and they are stuffing themselves with ice supports with these parasites and for

259
00:14:41.731 --> 00:14:44.390
essentially what they would rather do if they can get away with it,

260
00:14:44.420 --> 00:14:49.040
is not eat the ice pods,
but take a nice bite of skin,

261
00:14:49.041 --> 00:14:53.300
maybe the flesh and the mucus on the outside of a,
especially in on coral reefs,

262
00:14:53.330 --> 00:14:56.210
the slime that Fisher covered it in,
it's actually full of Sunscreen,

263
00:14:56.780 --> 00:14:58.300
which helped stop them from getting sunburned.

264
00:14:58.310 --> 00:15:01.760
It's a pretty important in this sunny environment.
Um,

265
00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:03.260
they don't make that sunscreen themselves.

266
00:15:03.261 --> 00:15:06.380
They have to get it in their food from bacteria and their food or you can lick

267
00:15:06.381 --> 00:15:07.960
it off another fish.
Um,

268
00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.210
but the cleaner Ras know that there's only certain times when they can get away

269
00:15:11.211 --> 00:15:15.260
with cheating basically.
Cause a fish would rather not have to make,
you know,

270
00:15:15.261 --> 00:15:18.630
he'll,
he'll,
it'll bite that it's been,
it's got from this cleaner asset,

271
00:15:18.650 --> 00:15:22.550
really just wants a good service if it's having as parasites removed.
Um,

272
00:15:22.670 --> 00:15:26.480
but this is where we really start to see the smarts of these little fish coming

273
00:15:26.481 --> 00:15:28.130
out.
And it's coming.

274
00:15:28.131 --> 00:15:32.060
It's through scientists who've been studying these things for the last 10 years

275
00:15:32.061 --> 00:15:32.810
or so,

276
00:15:32.810 --> 00:15:37.640
and spending hours and hours and hours watching cleaner ass in the wild and also

277
00:15:37.641 --> 00:15:38.550
in the board at trees.

278
00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:43.660
And they've showing that these guys have got a really smart way of,
uh,

279
00:15:43.700 --> 00:15:45.350
figuring out how they should behave.

280
00:15:45.740 --> 00:15:49.160
And they will memorize all of the clients that come to their,

281
00:15:49.220 --> 00:15:51.650
to this cleaning station and know exactly which ones,

282
00:15:51.651 --> 00:15:55.010
which they will be able to distinguish between different species.

283
00:15:55.011 --> 00:15:56.260
So simplistically,

284
00:15:56.280 --> 00:15:59.150
one of the first things they will figure out as well as it a herbivore or a

285
00:15:59.151 --> 00:16:00.440
predator.
Um,

286
00:16:00.441 --> 00:16:04.520
if it's a fairly harmless herbivore like this surgeon fish on the lefthand side,

287
00:16:04.890 --> 00:16:05.240
um,

288
00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:08.240
then it can occasionally get away with a bit of cheating because there's not too

289
00:16:08.241 --> 00:16:11.270
much harm done.
But,
uh,

290
00:16:11.271 --> 00:16:14.660
if it is a Predator like this moray eel on the right hand side,

291
00:16:14.900 --> 00:16:17.440
you better behave pretty good because,
um,

292
00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:20.360
it's pretty extraordinary that this fish could climb into the mouth of a

293
00:16:20.361 --> 00:16:21.860
Predator or not just get eaten.

294
00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:25.820
There's this truth that has struck in a clean the cleaning station that only

295
00:16:25.821 --> 00:16:28.280
happens in this very special place anywhere else on the reef.

296
00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:32.280
And that more at your,
we'll just eat that Ras straight up.
But somehow they,

297
00:16:32.281 --> 00:16:35.540
they maintain this,
this kind of agreement that that's not going to happen.

298
00:16:35.810 --> 00:16:40.070
And it partly happens because the Ras behaves really well.
It doesn't cheat.
Um,

299
00:16:40.130 --> 00:16:43.740
and it also knows that it can own basically kind of manipulate that,
uh,

300
00:16:43.770 --> 00:16:48.590
other fish by giving it a massage essentially.
So they will,
um,

301
00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:52.520
they will rub themselves,
their fins over the body of,
of the,
uh,
the bigger fish.

302
00:16:52.850 --> 00:16:57.200
And studies have shown that the fish actually enjoy this so well they certainly,

303
00:16:57.201 --> 00:17:00.890
their stress hormones drop and they seem to relax.
Um,
but you know,

304
00:17:00.891 --> 00:17:02.810
you can interpret that as enjoyment if you like.

305
00:17:03.230 --> 00:17:06.440
It's possible even that some of these fish come to get clean so often and

306
00:17:06.441 --> 00:17:10.640
they'll come like many,
many times a day,
uh,
because it feels nice,
you know,

307
00:17:10.641 --> 00:17:12.020
and they do seem to have this kind of,

308
00:17:12.021 --> 00:17:15.200
they shiver and they stop and they will just sort of be in this trance as this

309
00:17:15.201 --> 00:17:17.630
little fish flix over its body rubbing and massaging.

310
00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.900
And that's also what the rattle do if they cheat.

311
00:17:20.990 --> 00:17:24.080
So we kind of know that it is almost apologizing.
So,

312
00:17:24.290 --> 00:17:29.290
so say it's cleaning a herbivore which isn't going to eat it and also it will

313
00:17:29.481 --> 00:17:30.590
look and see who else is around.

314
00:17:30.591 --> 00:17:33.080
So if there's a big long queue of other fish waiting,

315
00:17:33.110 --> 00:17:36.170
they tend to be pretty well behaved because they don't want to because they know

316
00:17:36.171 --> 00:17:39.500
that there's other fish could just swim off.
And go get clean someplace else.

317
00:17:39.830 --> 00:17:40.641
And they rely on that.

318
00:17:40.641 --> 00:17:44.200
They do rely on fish coming to be who to be clean for their food.
It's,

319
00:17:44.330 --> 00:17:46.700
but if the queue is kind of short and not too many people,

320
00:17:46.701 --> 00:17:49.590
what other fish waiting and if it's her before then,
yeah,

321
00:17:49.710 --> 00:17:52.170
I'll try and cheat and take some,
take some slime.

322
00:17:52.410 --> 00:17:56.100
But they will apologize and they will immediately kind of rob and smoothed over

323
00:17:56.101 --> 00:17:58.650
the fish and sort of say he don't,
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Don't swim off.

324
00:17:58.651 --> 00:18:00.510
Please don't swim off.
And you know,

325
00:18:00.511 --> 00:18:04.950
and usually it works and they kind of settle down and there a case.
So,
so yes.

326
00:18:04.951 --> 00:18:07.580
So the clean air act and there's lots of other aspects of their lives that

327
00:18:07.590 --> 00:18:11.670
really surprising.
Um,
they often operate in pairs.

328
00:18:11.671 --> 00:18:14.020
So a men and a female will were clean together.
Uh,

329
00:18:14.220 --> 00:18:18.600
and the male has the female totally kind of controlled because,
um,

330
00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:22.110
she must never cheat because if she cheats and eats too much mucus and grows too

331
00:18:22.111 --> 00:18:26.260
big,
she could change sex,
turn into a male and steal his territory.
Um,

332
00:18:26.310 --> 00:18:29.180
cause he's the one of the sex changing species of fish that we have.
Um,

333
00:18:29.190 --> 00:18:32.160
and he really doesn't want his partner to end up and kind of grabbing his

334
00:18:32.161 --> 00:18:36.240
territory.
So if he sees her cheating,
he is mean to her.

335
00:18:36.241 --> 00:18:39.360
And we'll basically kind of chase her and bite her because he knows this,

336
00:18:39.361 --> 00:18:42.960
it's really bad.
So the female has to sort of,
if she's with him,

337
00:18:42.961 --> 00:18:46.110
she has to behave.
So there's loads of crazy things going on in their lives.

338
00:18:46.111 --> 00:18:50.790
And so basically the cleaner Ras is showing us that despite their small size and

339
00:18:50.791 --> 00:18:51.660
a small brains,

340
00:18:51.690 --> 00:18:56.160
they have evolved and the need to have quite complex social lives to be able to

341
00:18:56.161 --> 00:19:00.760
communicate,
uh,
to understand the,
that there's different types of fish and to,

342
00:19:00.761 --> 00:19:05.490
to change and tailor their services according to what's going on around them.

343
00:19:05.700 --> 00:19:08.670
And those are all things that maybe we wouldn't have expected not so long ago

344
00:19:08.671 --> 00:19:11.970
that fish could leave such,
such kind of nuanced lives and not just,

345
00:19:11.971 --> 00:19:16.210
it's not just a hardwired behavior.
This is responding and solving problems and,

346
00:19:16.211 --> 00:19:21.180
and really kind of smart ways so that there's the keener us.
Okay.

347
00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:23.120
I'm going to move on to,
um,

348
00:19:23.490 --> 00:19:26.520
another myth that we get in the fish world and I'm going to come back to my

349
00:19:26.521 --> 00:19:29.340
favorites.
Uh,
lady Marie Fish.
Um,

350
00:19:29.341 --> 00:19:32.730
so another idea that has kind of been around for a long time is that fish are

351
00:19:32.731 --> 00:19:36.810
silent and that they don't make any sounds.
Um,
I remember as a kid,

352
00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:40.980
uh,
reading books and if there were lots of animals and the books I could do,

353
00:19:41.190 --> 00:19:44.610
I could do the noises,
I can do the cows and the sheep and the darks.

354
00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:48.560
But whenever there was a fish in the picture,
I was kind of stumped,
you know,

355
00:19:48.630 --> 00:19:51.940
what noise does the fish make?
It's pretty tricky.
Um,
and,

356
00:19:52.030 --> 00:19:55.050
and we kind of assume that they don't make any sense,
but they,
they actually do.

357
00:19:55.051 --> 00:19:58.200
And this lady got involved in understanding more about the sounds of fish and it

358
00:19:58.201 --> 00:20:02.100
was after the Second World War and the US Navy,

359
00:20:02.130 --> 00:20:06.990
we're actually the ones who were interested in knowing about fish sounds.
Uh,

360
00:20:07.020 --> 00:20:07.801
because,
uh,

361
00:20:07.801 --> 00:20:10.620
the war effort had been conducted quite a lot of it had been conducted

362
00:20:10.630 --> 00:20:12.840
underwater.
There were submarines for the first time.

363
00:20:12.930 --> 00:20:16.680
Hydrophones had been invented to listen for enemy Warcraft.

364
00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:20.820
Only half the time all they could hear was just sounds of animals underwater and

365
00:20:20.821 --> 00:20:23.010
it was really getting in the way.
So,
um,

366
00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:25.420
for the next 20 years after the Second World War,
um,

367
00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:28.920
marine fish at the University of Rhode Island was funded by the u s navy to

368
00:20:28.921 --> 00:20:32.730
basically go out and record the voices of fish to figure out when are they
noisy,

369
00:20:32.731 --> 00:20:34.320
what species make these sounds,

370
00:20:34.321 --> 00:20:38.190
where are they just try and kind of listened through this cacophony of sounds

371
00:20:38.191 --> 00:20:41.460
they were making.
So,
and that's what she did.
Um,

372
00:20:41.550 --> 00:20:45.570
she was apparently given a Chevrolet Wagoner's her kind of fish listening

373
00:20:45.690 --> 00:20:46.111
station.

374
00:20:46.111 --> 00:20:49.240
She would drive around the coast of Maine and New England and this was packed

375
00:20:49.241 --> 00:20:53.950
out with the equipment,
the latest hydrophones miles of cables,
walkie talkies,

376
00:20:54.130 --> 00:20:57.400
all sorts of really cool stuff.
I don't have a picture of what that looked like,

377
00:20:57.401 --> 00:21:00.820
but I kind of imagined it looked a bit like this.
I'm only,

378
00:21:00.821 --> 00:21:03.340
she wasn't looking for to bust the ghosts.

379
00:21:03.341 --> 00:21:06.520
She was trying to find fish to record their voices and she did.

380
00:21:06.521 --> 00:21:08.470
She recorded hundreds of different fish voices.

381
00:21:08.830 --> 00:21:12.070
And I'm just going to play a couple of years for you now cause these are

382
00:21:12.071 --> 00:21:14.910
available on archives online.
Um,

383
00:21:14.970 --> 00:21:17.590
just to give you an idea of these are the sorts of thousand fish,

384
00:21:17.591 --> 00:21:21.010
make 'em no prizes for guessing help.
This one got its name.

385
00:21:22.940 --> 00:21:24.980
<v 3>This is the grunt.
Quite loud.
Sorry.</v>

386
00:21:30.370 --> 00:21:33.790
<v 2>Yep.
So there we go.
A grunting fish.
Um,
there was this guy again,</v>

387
00:21:33.791 --> 00:21:35.800
no prizes for guessing the new name.

388
00:21:39.340 --> 00:21:40.173
<v 5>Oh,</v>

389
00:21:44.820 --> 00:21:48.210
<v 2>it's nice.
Hang on a second.
Segments good or become that.</v>

390
00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:52.320
That's an amazing sound.
That's a male Croker talking to a female and I can see,

391
00:21:52.860 --> 00:21:53.590
I can see him

392
00:21:53.590 --> 00:21:56.260
<v 3>how they respond to that.
You've got to see Robin as well.</v>

393
00:21:57.480 --> 00:21:59.980
Kind of sounds like it's balling thing.
Amazing sounds.

394
00:22:04.170 --> 00:22:04.291
<v 2>Okay.</v>

395
00:22:04.291 --> 00:22:07.260
So first make loads of sounds and there's hundreds of fish that she recorded and

396
00:22:07.940 --> 00:22:10.800
analyzed their different sounds like we're making.
And um,

397
00:22:10.801 --> 00:22:13.500
and we now know that fish makes sounds for all sorts of different reasons.

398
00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:17.520
This is a Damsel,
fish and other fish from a coral reef.
They are very angry,

399
00:22:17.700 --> 00:22:20.090
a territorial fish.
And if you come close today,

400
00:22:20.091 --> 00:22:23.460
they farm seaweed on the reef and if you come close to that little territory,

401
00:22:23.461 --> 00:22:24.390
they will try and scare you off,

402
00:22:24.391 --> 00:22:27.810
even if you're a human scuba diver and they will chat to their teeth together

403
00:22:27.811 --> 00:22:30.390
and make this drumming sound and you can hear it in the water and I'll swim at

404
00:22:30.391 --> 00:22:35.370
you and try and scare you off.
Um,
uh,
other fish will make sounds,

405
00:22:35.460 --> 00:22:40.180
uh,
to,
to court each other to make,
uh,
to sort of attract,
uh,
partners,
um,

406
00:22:40.230 --> 00:22:43.600
during fights.
So Piranhas,
how about these three different calls?
We think that,

407
00:22:43.601 --> 00:22:43.980
uh,

408
00:22:43.980 --> 00:22:46.560
that they use at different points of their fights when it's the beginning of a

409
00:22:46.561 --> 00:22:49.650
fight and they're just kind of checking each other out in the middle of a fight,

410
00:22:49.651 --> 00:22:52.890
there'll be a different sound.
And then the victor has a kind of victory,

411
00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:57.710
a kind of chant that it shouts out and says like,
I win,
you lose to come back.

412
00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:02.760
Um,
they make the sounds and various different ways.
So,
uh,
the grunt is grinding.

413
00:23:02.761 --> 00:23:05.640
It's second set of teeth together.
A lot of fish.
I have a second,

414
00:23:05.890 --> 00:23:08.970
a set of teeth at the back of their throats called the pharyngeal teeth.

415
00:23:09.330 --> 00:23:11.430
He's a three d printed version of these guys,

416
00:23:11.431 --> 00:23:15.240
I think a brilliant use of three d printing and they grind their teeth together

417
00:23:15.270 --> 00:23:16.800
to make those kind of grunting sounds.

418
00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:20.820
The other thing fish do is user an organ in their body called the swim bladder,

419
00:23:20.970 --> 00:23:22.650
which we actually think of old from lungs.

420
00:23:22.651 --> 00:23:26.400
That fish did evolve lungs quite early on and then secondarily evolved this

421
00:23:26.401 --> 00:23:29.100
organ which they use primarily as a flotation device,

422
00:23:29.101 --> 00:23:33.660
does sorting from sinking under water but also to make sounds.
So,
um,

423
00:23:33.690 --> 00:23:35.910
they do this and lots and lots of different ways.

424
00:23:35.911 --> 00:23:38.310
I'm going to show you one more video clip of a noisy fishes,

425
00:23:38.340 --> 00:23:40.890
a toad fish making some sounds.

426
00:23:44.030 --> 00:23:45.210
She's pretty dramatic

427
00:23:48.650 --> 00:23:50.310
and well that fish is doing is uh,

428
00:23:50.311 --> 00:23:52.940
it has a muscle on the outside of it's from [inaudible] and it's by bracing that

429
00:23:52.941 --> 00:23:56.120
balloon,
uh,
to make their sounds trigger fish,

430
00:23:56.121 --> 00:23:57.530
which we showed in that video earlier.

431
00:23:57.531 --> 00:23:59.710
They will drum their fins against this from Datto.

432
00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:02.540
So kind of use it as a drum skin,
which is,
which is pretty cool.

433
00:24:03.020 --> 00:24:05.720
And then I always have to give this example,
especially when I'm talking to kids.

434
00:24:05.750 --> 00:24:06.583
So,
uh,

435
00:24:06.620 --> 00:24:11.150
there's just the herring which allow let little bubbles of gas out of their swim

436
00:24:11.151 --> 00:24:13.340
bladders,
they fill us from Bella's up from their mouths,

437
00:24:13.490 --> 00:24:16.370
the steroid connection through to that,
uh,
from the air.

438
00:24:16.371 --> 00:24:19.550
But they let out these bubbles at night time to kind of coordinate their

439
00:24:19.551 --> 00:24:23.510
shoulders so they know what they are and the shoal and it's dark and they let

440
00:24:23.511 --> 00:24:27.110
small bubbles out,
which will make a little sound,
but it comes out of their bums.

441
00:24:27.170 --> 00:24:30.560
And the scientists who discovered this called it the fast repetitive tick.

442
00:24:30.590 --> 00:24:34.980
And I'm not kidding his,
the science paper that it came from,
uh,

443
00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:39.590
what's quite fun.
So fish,
it makes sense for all sorts of reasons.

444
00:24:39.591 --> 00:24:42.200
They are much more sonic than we ever thought they were.

445
00:24:42.201 --> 00:24:45.560
And we're still understanding how this kind of fits into their ecology and how

446
00:24:45.561 --> 00:24:50.090
they're using sound.
Um,
uh,
to,
to yeah,
to as a,

447
00:24:50.091 --> 00:24:52.080
as an important resource that they have available to,

448
00:24:52.100 --> 00:24:55.310
to communicate with each other.
Okay.
So we've had sound,

449
00:24:55.311 --> 00:24:58.850
we've had a fish smarts and brains,
uh,

450
00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:02.720
which are things that we sort of don't necessarily think much of in the fish

451
00:25:02.721 --> 00:25:05.660
world.
The book also,
um,

452
00:25:05.780 --> 00:25:10.070
I try to address and look at some of the aspects of fish lives that are unique

453
00:25:10.340 --> 00:25:12.890
to the fish and the things that they do that you really don't see in other

454
00:25:12.891 --> 00:25:16.130
groups of animals,
certainly in other groups of vertebrates.

455
00:25:16.850 --> 00:25:18.860
And there are some things that fish just really,

456
00:25:18.861 --> 00:25:23.861
really good at and have extraordinary abilities that nothing else really has.

457
00:25:24.050 --> 00:25:28.580
And one of those things is bioluminescence the ability to make light.

458
00:25:29.010 --> 00:25:31.910
Um,
there are 1500 species of fish that have,

459
00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:34.970
that we know of at the moment that have this ability to make light.
Um,

460
00:25:35.330 --> 00:25:38.750
and this things like the flashlight fish here,
which has,
um,
uh,

461
00:25:38.780 --> 00:25:42.890
basically has like headlights on the front of it to see through the dark.
Um,

462
00:25:42.920 --> 00:25:47.390
there's the angler fish.
If any of you seen that lolly documentary finding Nemo,

463
00:25:47.391 --> 00:25:50.480
I think you should be familiar with Angler fish and the fact that they have
this,

464
00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:54.230
um,
this layer at the front of their heads which dangles down and then it tracks

465
00:25:54.231 --> 00:25:55.280
food into their big mouth.

466
00:25:55.610 --> 00:25:59.720
This picture actually comes from just recently taken from a piece of footage off

467
00:25:59.721 --> 00:26:04.280
the coast of the Azores in the middle of the Pacific islands down of about 800

468
00:26:04.281 --> 00:26:09.050
meters.
And I believe it's one of the first pieces of footage showing live.

469
00:26:09.350 --> 00:26:13.190
Um,
female angler fish,
which are the big ones that you can see,

470
00:26:13.220 --> 00:26:15.410
but with a male trailing along behind her.

471
00:26:15.411 --> 00:26:16.970
And I should think you can just make out here,

472
00:26:16.971 --> 00:26:21.110
there's a spike in them sticking down from her is the degenerative tiny male who

473
00:26:21.111 --> 00:26:25.160
basically is a parasite and kind of grabs onto her and his skin will fuse with

474
00:26:25.161 --> 00:26:29.480
hers and he'll just drag around with her and then he,
she will use him when,

475
00:26:29.720 --> 00:26:33.230
when she needs to.
Uh,
so,
so that's pretty cool.

476
00:26:33.240 --> 00:26:34.910
So that's the first time we've seen that.
And also,

477
00:26:34.911 --> 00:26:38.510
I think hopefully you can just make out,
they've got this kind of net of feelers,

478
00:26:38.511 --> 00:26:40.110
like tentacles coming out,
um,

479
00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:43.870
which may also be bioluminescent the kind of hard to see in the picture.
Um,
it's,

480
00:26:43.871 --> 00:26:46.050
we're not sure,
but they seem to have maybe,

481
00:26:46.140 --> 00:26:48.610
maybe they work a bit like cat's whiskers.
They're sensing things in the,

482
00:26:48.710 --> 00:26:52.260
in the water around them.
Um,
so yeah,
so fish are very bioluminescent.

483
00:26:52.261 --> 00:26:56.410
Here's a diagram of the fish family tree and,
um,

484
00:26:56.610 --> 00:26:59.830
1500 species,
but they're dotted all through the evolutionary tree.

485
00:26:59.831 --> 00:27:04.290
We think maybe on 30 separate occasions,
fish have evolved to glow in the dark.

486
00:27:04.291 --> 00:27:06.990
This is something that just keeps happening.
Um,

487
00:27:07.020 --> 00:27:09.180
and it's an example I think of showing that fish,

488
00:27:09.181 --> 00:27:13.260
these 30,000 species are really this wonderful experiments and evolution and in

489
00:27:13.261 --> 00:27:14.970
life.
And we can see,

490
00:27:14.990 --> 00:27:18.420
you can understand more about bigger questions of evolution and the natural

491
00:27:18.421 --> 00:27:23.100
world through the fish,
um,
and things like this.
So it's the fact that it's,
um,

492
00:27:23.650 --> 00:27:25.200
it's so common to evolve.

493
00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:29.790
Bioluminescence and fishes is not a big difficult question to answer.

494
00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:30.990
It's really dark down there.

495
00:27:30.991 --> 00:27:34.440
We're talking about fish that live mostly down in what we call the midnight
zone,

496
00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:38.750
beyond a thousand meters down,
3000 feet.
We're no sunlight riches.
Um,

497
00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:41.240
so it makes sense that if there's no light around,

498
00:27:41.250 --> 00:27:45.000
then making your own light is super useful for seeing through the dark

499
00:27:45.001 --> 00:27:49.680
protracting food for attracting mates and all those kinds of things.
So you know,

500
00:27:49.681 --> 00:27:53.840
this is something the fish have returned to again and again.
Um,

501
00:27:54.300 --> 00:27:56.730
they aren't all in the midnight zone,
I should say.

502
00:27:56.760 --> 00:27:59.700
There are some that live a little bit higher up in what we call the twilight

503
00:27:59.701 --> 00:28:03.150
zone.
So this is between about 200 meters,

504
00:28:03.151 --> 00:28:05.490
so 600 feet down into the midnight zone.

505
00:28:05.491 --> 00:28:08.190
And this is where we get just mostly really dark blue light.

506
00:28:08.340 --> 00:28:11.560
All the other wavelengths of light had been absorbed by water,
um,

507
00:28:11.730 --> 00:28:14.240
leaving the short wave length,
blue light.
Uhm,

508
00:28:14.770 --> 00:28:17.760
especially why the oceans are blue because that's the light that penetrates the

509
00:28:17.761 --> 00:28:21.480
deepest.
And one of the creatures that live down there is the sky,

510
00:28:21.510 --> 00:28:22.980
the velvet belly lantern shark,

511
00:28:22.981 --> 00:28:25.320
a fully going shop that you could hold in the palm of your hand,

512
00:28:25.620 --> 00:28:29.820
which is pretty cool and it has blue bioluminescence all across its belly.

513
00:28:30.210 --> 00:28:33.510
And the reason it does that is so that it can hide in this area,

514
00:28:33.511 --> 00:28:34.350
the twilight zone.

515
00:28:35.070 --> 00:28:38.490
Because imagine if you're down there basically looking up towards the surface,

516
00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:41.400
you would see this deep,
beautiful,
deep blue light.

517
00:28:41.960 --> 00:28:45.630
I'm similar to if you stepped out at twilight out on land and you'd look up and

518
00:28:45.631 --> 00:28:49.800
you see this dark blue sky,
and then if a a bat or a bird flew overhead,

519
00:28:49.801 --> 00:28:53.190
you'd see it's dark silhouette,
and if you were a predator,
you'd think a,
Ha,

520
00:28:53.370 --> 00:28:56.850
there's my food.
Same thing happens in the deep ocean,
in the twilight zone.

521
00:28:56.880 --> 00:28:59.940
If a bunch of fish swim by and the Predator sees those shadows,

522
00:28:59.941 --> 00:29:01.320
they know where to aim for.

523
00:29:01.830 --> 00:29:05.490
But of course bio luminescence helps to get around that and it helps these fish

524
00:29:05.491 --> 00:29:08.340
to hide in plain sight.
Now lots of fish do this.

525
00:29:08.341 --> 00:29:12.270
They have maybe lines of bioluminescence down their bellies to kind of break up

526
00:29:12.271 --> 00:29:14.190
their silhouettes.
They don't look so much like fish.

527
00:29:14.520 --> 00:29:17.040
We get something like the velvet very lantern shark,

528
00:29:17.041 --> 00:29:20.330
which just match entire the whole co,
um,

529
00:29:20.370 --> 00:29:24.360
the cover their entire bellies with blue lights that matches the light around

530
00:29:24.361 --> 00:29:27.660
them and they can adjust the intensity of that like depending on where they are

531
00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:30.240
in the water column.
So it's like a cloak of invisibility,

532
00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:33.990
which is really quite awesome.
Um,
just a quick one,

533
00:29:33.991 --> 00:29:38.160
if you're interested to know how bioluminescence actually works.
Um,
uh,

534
00:29:38.190 --> 00:29:41.620
half of the fish basically have chemicals that they have genes that produce

535
00:29:41.621 --> 00:29:44.490
chemicals in their bodies that produced that's light.
Um,

536
00:29:44.500 --> 00:29:47.740
we generically call one of the molecules Lucifer suffering.

537
00:29:47.770 --> 00:29:49.990
It's actually a whole bunch of different things.
It can be,
but that's,

538
00:29:50.020 --> 00:29:53.530
that's the name it's come up with.
And an enzyme called luciferase.
Again,

539
00:29:53.531 --> 00:29:56.780
it could be different things,
but basically it's an oxygenation reaction.

540
00:29:56.860 --> 00:30:00.710
It speeds up a Salissa phrase.
It speeds up the reaction in the Lucifer,

541
00:30:00.711 --> 00:30:04.510
even with oxygen.
And the outcome is a,
is photons of light.

542
00:30:05.560 --> 00:30:08.200
So about half the fish have these deans and that's what happens.

543
00:30:08.650 --> 00:30:13.180
And half of them have bacteria that are bioluminescent and they have organs in

544
00:30:13.181 --> 00:30:17.830
their body where they kind of nurture those bacteria and,
and make like that way.

545
00:30:18.240 --> 00:30:21.560
Um,
and this I think has to be the most ingenious,
um,

546
00:30:21.880 --> 00:30:25.980
example of a bioluminescent fish that illuminated net devil,
uh,

547
00:30:26.020 --> 00:30:29.980
because it does both.
It has both in its lurid sticking up from its head.

548
00:30:30.010 --> 00:30:34.870
She has bacteria and that's kind of a bulb at the end and she's got this

549
00:30:34.871 --> 00:30:38.650
beautiful beard down at the bottom,
um,
which is a chemical reaction.

550
00:30:38.651 --> 00:30:41.800
So she's evolved bioluminescence twice within the same fish,

551
00:30:41.830 --> 00:30:45.970
which is just extraordinary and wonderful.
Um,
so there we go.

552
00:30:45.970 --> 00:30:49.440
So bioluminescence doesn't happen in any other vertebrates.
Um,

553
00:30:49.480 --> 00:30:51.970
fish are the only ones that do it and my goodness,
they do it.

554
00:30:52.330 --> 00:30:56.170
And it's just one example I think of some of the stuff that fish do that's quite

555
00:30:56.171 --> 00:31:00.250
surprising.
Um,
but it suits them perfectly to this,
this extraordinary world.

556
00:31:00.251 --> 00:31:02.110
They live in this deep,
dark ocean,

557
00:31:02.111 --> 00:31:06.280
deep blue ocean that's so different from us and the world that we know out on

558
00:31:06.281 --> 00:31:10.390
land.
So that's about all I'm going to talk about.
And it gives me,

559
00:31:10.391 --> 00:31:15.220
brings me to a brilliant points where I can hand over to Aaj,
uh,

560
00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:17.750
cause I want to introduce you to some of the beautiful artwork that he's done.

561
00:31:17.770 --> 00:31:20.830
So not only have we got the front cover,
but for each chapter,

562
00:31:21.630 --> 00:31:26.630
Ada has produced us full page illustration to go with the subject matter of the

563
00:31:26.940 --> 00:31:30.190
chapter.
And,
um,
from my perspective,

564
00:31:30.220 --> 00:31:35.220
the process of how this happens and how this artwork came to be was,

565
00:31:35.580 --> 00:31:37.910
was quite a simple one.
I would write my chapter,
um,

566
00:31:37.960 --> 00:31:39.940
I would decide what the chapter was about.

567
00:31:39.941 --> 00:31:43.600
I would gather ideas of the key characters in that chapter.

568
00:31:43.601 --> 00:31:46.990
So this is the chapter about bio luminescence and the sorts of awesome deep sea

569
00:31:46.991 --> 00:31:51.000
fish.
Um,
and then I would send a list of fish names,
Brian,

570
00:31:51.010 --> 00:31:55.440
an email from Cambridge in Britain and ping them over the ocean,
uh,

571
00:31:55.450 --> 00:31:58.090
to California.
And then some time later,

572
00:31:58.091 --> 00:32:00.100
some beautiful artwork appears in my inbox.

573
00:32:00.430 --> 00:32:02.320
And that's about all I know about the whole price.

574
00:32:02.950 --> 00:32:07.950
So I would love to hand over to Aja to maybe tell us a bit more about the

575
00:32:08.261 --> 00:32:09.420
process from your point of view.

576
00:32:09.421 --> 00:32:12.860
Cause I said Madison it's a little bit more involved than the magic box that you

577
00:32:12.861 --> 00:32:15.340
seem to be from my point of view a little bit more.

578
00:32:18.050 --> 00:32:21.160
<v 4>Where's your clicker?
Oh sorry,
I left it inside there.
Okay.</v>

579
00:32:21.980 --> 00:32:26.690
So this is one I think both of our,
one of our favorite drawings in the book.
Um,

580
00:32:26.930 --> 00:32:31.310
I love deep sea fish so I tore into this one with a lot of enthusiasm.

581
00:32:31.700 --> 00:32:36.230
Um,
but yeah,
the process for this would basically be held on with,

582
00:32:36.231 --> 00:32:40.610
send me an email with a list of species this and you know,

583
00:32:40.670 --> 00:32:44.450
I think I'd like to have all of these in the drawing and then I've got to come

584
00:32:44.451 --> 00:32:47.270
up with a way to make that look,
you know,

585
00:32:47.990 --> 00:32:50.150
natural but kind of not so natural.

586
00:32:50.151 --> 00:32:54.530
Cause obviously this isn't necessarily what the deep sea ocean looks like.
Um,

587
00:32:55.040 --> 00:32:57.950
this is kind of a party going on.
Um,

588
00:32:58.640 --> 00:33:02.570
and I think in this particular one it was pretty challenging because you want it

589
00:33:02.571 --> 00:33:06.210
to show the boat,
the ties in with the researcher,

590
00:33:06.230 --> 00:33:10.340
the original researcher who discovered a lot of these species and I think late

591
00:33:10.341 --> 00:33:14.340
18 hundreds or you okay.
Yeah.
So I had to draw,
you know,

592
00:33:14.900 --> 00:33:18.470
my little version of a period boat from that time.
Um,
and then you,

593
00:33:18.510 --> 00:33:21.700
you had the idea of one in a rope to come down and said,

594
00:33:21.701 --> 00:33:23.470
we're kind of looking up,
we're seeing the boat,

595
00:33:23.471 --> 00:33:26.750
we're seeing the rope and all these different species and that's quite something

596
00:33:26.751 --> 00:33:30.560
to wrap my head around as a designer and illustrator.
Um,

597
00:33:31.340 --> 00:33:35.600
plus you had,
you had your mile long list.
I even added some to this.
Um,

598
00:33:36.050 --> 00:33:40.460
but so usually what I do is I start out with just some really basic kind of

599
00:33:40.461 --> 00:33:44.780
rough thumbs like this and I started feeling it out.
Um,

600
00:33:44.840 --> 00:33:48.650
actually this is where I start.
So really simple,

601
00:33:48.651 --> 00:33:50.750
just sketching in real quick.

602
00:33:51.440 --> 00:33:55.190
But with this drawing I pretty much had it from the very get go.

603
00:33:55.490 --> 00:33:58.160
The idea like how this could go down is in my head,

604
00:33:58.820 --> 00:34:01.280
refined it a bit here.
Um,

605
00:34:01.281 --> 00:34:05.450
I think I moved the Lantern Shark over and kind of puzzled,
you know,

606
00:34:05.690 --> 00:34:10.340
the sharks in there.
Um,
and then I would send,

607
00:34:10.341 --> 00:34:13.790
so I wouldn't show him that because any illustrator will tell you,

608
00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:17.790
never show him your thumbnails because the editors and the,
and the authors,

609
00:34:17.820 --> 00:34:22.220
anyone else,
we started freaking out like,
oh boy,
you know,
I dunno dude,

610
00:34:22.221 --> 00:34:24.320
if you were cut out for the job,
um,

611
00:34:24.920 --> 00:34:29.920
and every pro illustrator will draw that sloppy in the first stages.

612
00:34:30.720 --> 00:34:35.310
Um,
so you don't want to show that,
but this,
this,
you know,
tightened up a bit.
Uh,

613
00:34:35.350 --> 00:34:38.930
so this is the rough I would send over and everybody would,
you know,
you'd,

614
00:34:38.950 --> 00:34:41.230
you'd have your critiques and whatnot.
Um,

615
00:34:41.300 --> 00:34:46.300
I managed to get the boat in there and showed the rope and the kind of illusion

616
00:34:46.611 --> 00:34:51.020
of maybe we're looking at a trail of animals going up to the,
to the boat,
um,

617
00:34:51.050 --> 00:34:53.540
even through some mountains in there to show the kind of,

618
00:34:54.230 --> 00:34:57.200
cause a lot of this was done pretty far up north.
Right.
And the research,

619
00:34:58.570 --> 00:35:00.150
<v 2>oh,
it's like this global journey.</v>

620
00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:02.880
But I do love the fact you have the mountains and cause I think there's a lot of

621
00:35:02.881 --> 00:35:06.890
classic images of the time of like,
yeah,
here's the boat and the sort of scenery.

622
00:35:06.950 --> 00:35:10.110
Like they would never have seen it live face.
But I feel like that topic,

623
00:35:10.470 --> 00:35:11.670
<v 4>I think I must've been channeling,</v>

624
00:35:11.671 --> 00:35:13.860
I don't know if he knew if you've watched the show,
the terror,

625
00:35:14.100 --> 00:35:15.600
but I had ride read that book and a want to go,

626
00:35:15.601 --> 00:35:19.080
but it's basically a British expedition.
We'd go up to the Arctic,
you know?

627
00:35:19.530 --> 00:35:22.260
And so I was thinking it was that same time period.
So I'm like,
Oh,

628
00:35:22.261 --> 00:35:25.830
well you've got to have the Arctic and there's this some kind of mountains.

629
00:35:25.831 --> 00:35:27.810
But anyways,
um,

630
00:35:28.230 --> 00:35:32.450
everything he or she wanted except for this one,
um,

631
00:35:32.490 --> 00:35:36.090
this is a Ninja Lantern Shark.
Let's see if it gets to the real thing.

632
00:35:37.230 --> 00:35:39.780
And that's a really cool species.
Maybe you guys have heard of it.

633
00:35:39.781 --> 00:35:42.840
It was actually,
it was all over the Internet last year.
Um,

634
00:35:42.930 --> 00:35:46.440
my friend Vicky Vasquez,
who's a local shark researcher,

635
00:35:46.920 --> 00:35:50.820
discovered it and her young nephew,

636
00:35:50.821 --> 00:35:54.450
I believe helped her name it,
hence the Ninja Lantern Shark.

637
00:35:54.810 --> 00:35:58.800
It's an all black shark and it's bioluminescent all the way down.
Um,

638
00:35:59.410 --> 00:36:01.470
something like God,
we got include that.
That's super cool.

639
00:36:01.500 --> 00:36:05.280
And then we got a cookie cutter,
which is the super weird scary shark.

640
00:36:05.281 --> 00:36:09.150
They will latch on to Wales and kind of twist and carve out a perfect,

641
00:36:09.540 --> 00:36:14.540
like a cookie cutter chunk of flesh.
Um,
whales,
dolphins,
even other sharks there.

642
00:36:14.570 --> 00:36:17.640
They're pretty nasty,
but only about this big,
but they had teeth.

643
00:36:17.641 --> 00:36:22.440
It's like something out of a horror movie.
Really wild.
Um,
fight for fish,

644
00:36:22.441 --> 00:36:23.250
dragon fish.

645
00:36:23.250 --> 00:36:27.480
This is called loose jaw cause this whole bottom job just completely comes out

646
00:36:27.750 --> 00:36:28.920
and you can see right through it.

647
00:36:29.010 --> 00:36:33.270
And it's just like an appendage blind with super little needle teeth.

648
00:36:33.930 --> 00:36:34.763
Um,

649
00:36:35.220 --> 00:36:39.180
this is one of my favorite and strangest fish and he was kind of making the

650
00:36:39.181 --> 00:36:41.520
rounds on the Internet,
I'd say about three or four years ago.

651
00:36:43.280 --> 00:36:45.840
That was Monterey Bay.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Actually,

652
00:36:45.841 --> 00:36:48.450
I think it was Ambari we're going to go talk to next week.

653
00:36:48.810 --> 00:36:52.980
I'm the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institution Institute.

654
00:36:54.780 --> 00:36:57.000
This fish has developed the ability,

655
00:36:57.390 --> 00:37:01.590
so these two little slits here are it's actual eyelids to develop,

656
00:37:01.591 --> 00:37:06.330
the ability to pop its eyes back out from his eyelids and look straight up

657
00:37:06.331 --> 00:37:07.920
through it's translucent skull.

658
00:37:08.340 --> 00:37:12.300
That way you can see prey and or predators coming at it from above.

659
00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:15.900
So this whole top dome is just clear.

660
00:37:16.220 --> 00:37:19.020
So it's like the creepiest thing ever.
Um,

661
00:37:19.110 --> 00:37:21.840
and I got to kind of figure out how to draw that in a black and white ink

662
00:37:21.841 --> 00:37:26.340
drawing.
But yeah,
so this was one of our favorites.
Um,
composition lean,

663
00:37:27.180 --> 00:37:29.930
you know,
as an artist you,
you try to just fit everything in with,

664
00:37:29.980 --> 00:37:34.140
with the fluid motion.
I like to add some natural interact,
you know,

665
00:37:34.170 --> 00:37:37.410
interactive elements.
This guy's obviously chasing these guys.

666
00:37:38.070 --> 00:37:41.400
This dude is just trying to be part of the party,
which like personality wise,

667
00:37:41.401 --> 00:37:44.820
I also try to kind of capture their personality.
So,
um,

668
00:37:46.140 --> 00:37:49.820
so the Angler fish is just like here,
it goes over given me and then the,

669
00:37:49.821 --> 00:37:52.810
you know,
the sharks are kind of the rock stars.
They're up top.
Um,

670
00:37:53.310 --> 00:37:56.430
I forget the species name of this little dude,

671
00:37:58.260 --> 00:38:02.280
not the lantern,
but it's the most prolific,
like one of those prolific.
Yeah,

672
00:38:03.090 --> 00:38:07.080
I think so.
I can find out.
I'll quiz you on that.
Um,
oops,
that's you.

673
00:38:08.580 --> 00:38:10.740
So that was a lot of fun.
Um,

674
00:38:11.190 --> 00:38:16.190
and then one of the ways that we have found each other is I own a tee shirt

675
00:38:16.441 --> 00:38:18.210
company called cotton crustacean,

676
00:38:18.990 --> 00:38:23.670
which originally I started with the focus on prehistoric marine animals.

677
00:38:24.290 --> 00:38:27.390
Um,
long story super short,

678
00:38:27.720 --> 00:38:29.700
did a Kickstarter to launch the thing.

679
00:38:29.730 --> 00:38:32.730
One of the rewards was if you pay x amount of money,

680
00:38:32.731 --> 00:38:36.610
you get to pick the animal as long as it's aquatic or prehistoric.

681
00:38:36.910 --> 00:38:39.790
That way I could maybe get some cold dinosaurs in there.
If somebody picked it,

682
00:38:40.690 --> 00:38:41.920
I would draw that animal,

683
00:38:42.270 --> 00:38:45.880
I would include in the tee shirt line and you'd get the original art.
Um,

684
00:38:46.420 --> 00:38:49.420
this one guy went down to an aquarium with his son.

685
00:38:49.510 --> 00:38:53.080
He was a fan of what I was doing before.
So he knew of me,

686
00:38:53.900 --> 00:38:57.820
really wants to support and we've done an aquarium with his son to go see the

687
00:38:57.821 --> 00:39:01.990
Argonaute octopus that was washing up kinda down,
not the long beach aquarium,

688
00:39:01.991 --> 00:39:03.220
but there's another little aquarium down there,

689
00:39:03.221 --> 00:39:05.950
I think it's called the [inaudible] aquarium.
Um,

690
00:39:06.940 --> 00:39:11.650
and so he went down there and he did the Kickstarter reward.
And you know,

691
00:39:11.840 --> 00:39:14.620
again,
like when I came up with that idea,
I was hoping people to be like,
yeah,

692
00:39:14.621 --> 00:39:18.160
Mazda,
soar and Chronos source and I'll really cool big,
you know,

693
00:39:18.560 --> 00:39:23.560
TV toothy things.
And he says,
well I want an organized,
which is about at,

694
00:39:23.620 --> 00:39:26.830
at the largest,
maybe this big.
Usually they're really small.

695
00:39:27.010 --> 00:39:30.700
They're also called paper.
Nautilus is,
um,
cause what it is,

696
00:39:30.701 --> 00:39:33.970
it's the only octopus that makes a shell alive today.

697
00:39:34.330 --> 00:39:38.170
The female does it excretes it from the palms of your hands and it's like super

698
00:39:38.171 --> 00:39:41.590
paper thin.
It was like an eggshell,
that's all.
Like,
oh,
all right.

699
00:39:41.591 --> 00:39:44.740
So I got to do that and ended up doing the drawing.

700
00:39:45.430 --> 00:39:48.460
It's become my most popular shirt.
I cannot keep them in stock.

701
00:39:49.450 --> 00:39:52.750
And if you Google the Argonaute octopus,

702
00:39:53.440 --> 00:39:57.520
it is like the third or fourth image in the top row,
even with just other,

703
00:39:57.540 --> 00:39:59.230
you know,
photographs and whatnot.
Um,

704
00:39:59.290 --> 00:40:01.810
it's definitely the first illustration you'll find online.

705
00:40:02.440 --> 00:40:04.690
And so when she was writing spirals and time,

706
00:40:04.691 --> 00:40:07.780
which she talks about the Oregon at octopus in,
she was,

707
00:40:07.840 --> 00:40:11.350
I think you were googling literally,
uh,
images are going out.

708
00:40:11.351 --> 00:40:13.480
Octopuses came across my drawing,

709
00:40:13.570 --> 00:40:16.420
track me down through whatever websites hit me up.

710
00:40:16.810 --> 00:40:19.070
And here we are now on our second book.
Um,

711
00:40:19.660 --> 00:40:23.950
but originally my whole focus was giant monsters,
fish like this.

712
00:40:24.220 --> 00:40:28.540
And so when she said,
I have a chapter with all these guys in there,
I was stoked.

713
00:40:28.750 --> 00:40:33.580
And then she sent me the list of species.
It was this long.
So again,

714
00:40:33.581 --> 00:40:35.500
I have to sit there and think,
well,

715
00:40:35.501 --> 00:40:38.710
how do we add all these guys in there and make it kind of fun and not have it

716
00:40:38.711 --> 00:40:41.080
just so overwhelming.
Um,

717
00:40:41.530 --> 00:40:44.710
and the other main thing here with prehistoric animals,

718
00:40:44.830 --> 00:40:47.830
which is usually the case when people talk about dinosaurs,

719
00:40:47.831 --> 00:40:50.260
they show like TRX and stegosaurs hanging out.

720
00:40:50.770 --> 00:40:55.030
But those two animals are 70 million years apart.
They never knew each other.

721
00:40:55.600 --> 00:41:00.490
The same with the prehistoric fish and you know,
invert and whatnot,

722
00:41:01.630 --> 00:41:05.230
250,
almost 300 million years of these guys before dinosaurs.

723
00:41:05.920 --> 00:41:09.490
So when we're talking about species like a peer,
this is the both real epis,

724
00:41:09.491 --> 00:41:12.670
that bony guy way up there,
the Gogo fish,

725
00:41:13.090 --> 00:41:16.530
this little guy found on the Google reef in Australia.
Um,

726
00:41:17.140 --> 00:41:22.120
they're from the Devonian era,
so we're talking 350 ish,
almost 400,

727
00:41:22.270 --> 00:41:24.850
400 million years ago around there.
Um,

728
00:41:24.880 --> 00:41:27.760
part of a family of fish that are long gone,

729
00:41:27.761 --> 00:41:31.330
but they were called plaque of derms and they were usually armored and the first

730
00:41:31.331 --> 00:41:35.000
half,
like a little tank and then their soft bodies would be out,
you know,

731
00:41:35.001 --> 00:41:39.440
behind them.
These dudes were all any range,

732
00:41:39.480 --> 00:41:44.480
maybe at the biggest about this big fresh and salt water would eat scum and

733
00:41:44.511 --> 00:41:45.344
stuff on the bottom,

734
00:41:46.010 --> 00:41:49.130
but they had the rock star because in which is the Dunkleosteus,

735
00:41:49.190 --> 00:41:51.860
which is now becoming more and more popular and you know,

736
00:41:52.220 --> 00:41:53.990
movies and books and video games and whatnot.

737
00:41:54.800 --> 00:41:58.100
Basically the size of a school bus with a head,
like a snapping turtle.

738
00:41:59.180 --> 00:42:02.660
So we had to have them in there.
I think you had the idea of them fighting.

739
00:42:03.200 --> 00:42:06.800
So I got this guy doing the cheap shot and biting him.

740
00:42:07.280 --> 00:42:09.760
<v 2>I like to say that is because we found evidence that they did fight.</v>

741
00:42:09.860 --> 00:42:13.300
I think that's like fossils with like clearly like injuries that could only have

742
00:42:13.301 --> 00:42:17.950
been inflicted by another done class.
Right.
So like
a good og,

743
00:42:18.100 --> 00:42:19.930
I could kind of listen for doing that.

744
00:42:20.600 --> 00:42:22.670
<v 4>Imagine the skulls.
We find it,</v>

745
00:42:22.671 --> 00:42:27.020
these guys are about this wide and there's not even necessarily teeth.
It's like,

746
00:42:27.021 --> 00:42:30.650
uh,
they're,
they're armored kind of bone.

747
00:42:30.920 --> 00:42:34.940
Exos skull formed into the wedges of,
you know,
the,

748
00:42:34.980 --> 00:42:39.710
the plates I can like a turtle would be almost like a bird beak.
Um,
you know,

749
00:42:39.740 --> 00:42:42.560
God knows how heavy about the size of a bus.

750
00:42:42.980 --> 00:42:46.730
So I saw a lot of shirts with these guys on as you can imagine,

751
00:42:46.731 --> 00:42:51.560
kids love this kind of stuff.
But then on your list you had something,

752
00:42:51.561 --> 00:42:55.210
I can't even really pronounce it the moment we were trying to figure how to say

753
00:42:55.211 --> 00:42:59.240
it last night,
I could have a Carpool foma got her.
I think I got a second.

754
00:42:59.700 --> 00:43:02.590
<v 2>A little tip.
I also make sure the back of the book,
there's this,
uh,</v>

755
00:43:02.650 --> 00:43:05.160
there's a key so we know what they were though cause this is very potent to me.

756
00:43:05.161 --> 00:43:09.580
It is a Harpo.
Hang on.
Whoa paygo to Tor.

757
00:43:09.880 --> 00:43:12.780
Yes.
How Pega for two times,
that little dude with the,
yeah.

758
00:43:12.880 --> 00:43:16.390
<v 4>And so of course I'd never heard of that and I go online to look it up and</v>

759
00:43:16.391 --> 00:43:21.310
there's like maybe three sketches of one drawn.

760
00:43:21.790 --> 00:43:24.850
Um,
and like the worst fossil print you can,
you know,

761
00:43:24.920 --> 00:43:26.710
you would never be able to tell that it looked like this.

762
00:43:27.310 --> 00:43:28.900
And so as a scientific illustrator,
when you,

763
00:43:28.960 --> 00:43:33.580
when you come across that you kind of have to base your stuff both off of

764
00:43:33.581 --> 00:43:36.930
whatever published drawings or are out there and findings.
Um,

765
00:43:37.270 --> 00:43:40.210
I think one or even two of those three drawings weren't even professional.

766
00:43:40.360 --> 00:43:43.030
So there was like one true professional scientific illustration of it.

767
00:43:43.420 --> 00:43:48.070
So I knew the layout,
the fins,
he's just these little tiny dudes.

768
00:43:48.190 --> 00:43:49.900
Um,
and obviously when you draw it that small,

769
00:43:49.901 --> 00:43:51.270
I'm not going to get that detailed anyways.

770
00:43:51.580 --> 00:43:53.320
He ends up kind of looking like little marsh and guy.

771
00:43:53.890 --> 00:43:58.180
<v 2>I'm amazed that you didn't just say no,
no,
I think I'll do that.
But it's cool.</v>

772
00:43:58.340 --> 00:44:00.010
<v 4>Disliked his name so much.
I want to include them,</v>

773
00:44:00.580 --> 00:44:04.450
but then these guys are all kind of rock star prehistoric sharks.

774
00:44:04.750 --> 00:44:08.200
This is the step that campus and while he,
while he's known as,

775
00:44:08.201 --> 00:44:12.940
cause he has his kind of radar dish,
weird dorsal fin that has spikes on it.
Um,

776
00:44:13.540 --> 00:44:17.420
pretty small,
sharp,
but the size is like a grey reef shark.
Um,

777
00:44:18.460 --> 00:44:23.350
this is the Dustin gigantic.
Yes.
And he's from the carboniferous period.

778
00:44:23.590 --> 00:44:28.030
So when the planet was kind of overrun with insects,
super lush forests,

779
00:44:28.510 --> 00:44:31.640
um,
pretty much nothing else really cruising around.
It was like the,

780
00:44:31.770 --> 00:44:33.990
the time of the insects,
the ocean.

781
00:44:33.991 --> 00:44:38.910
We had these dudes and they had a single row of teeth and their upper and lower

782
00:44:38.911 --> 00:44:43.290
jaw,
it would come down like scissors.
And they were bigger than an average,

783
00:44:43.291 --> 00:44:47.700
modern,
great white shark,
about 25 feet long.
So,
you know,

784
00:44:48.510 --> 00:44:50.820
almost the length of,
not the length of this room going this way.

785
00:44:51.930 --> 00:44:53.010
So He's super cool.

786
00:44:54.060 --> 00:44:56.940
But all we have in the fossil record of these guys are here just,

787
00:44:57.060 --> 00:44:59.550
just the actual job moons.
So with sharks,

788
00:44:59.551 --> 00:45:02.820
because they're not an actual skeletal fish,
they're on a bony fish,

789
00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:06.570
skeletons made of cartilage,
doesn't fossilize hardly at all.

790
00:45:06.600 --> 00:45:10.500
And so we have to kind of guesstimate,
you know,

791
00:45:10.590 --> 00:45:15.390
and base them off of more prehistoric sharks are live today that we know have

792
00:45:15.391 --> 00:45:18.210
been around because we've found their teeth and we're not in the fossil record.

793
00:45:18.540 --> 00:45:22.620
So in the bay we have seven gill sharks to super prehistoric shark because we've

794
00:45:22.640 --> 00:45:26.940
found fossils of the exact teeth from 200 million years ago.
Um,

795
00:45:27.600 --> 00:45:30.450
and then this dude who doesn't necessarily get the limelight,

796
00:45:30.451 --> 00:45:34.950
like his other buddies here has become one of the biggest rock stars called the

797
00:45:34.960 --> 00:45:39.870
helicoprian.
And his bottom jaw was basically like,

798
00:45:40.110 --> 00:45:44.460
well,
this is what we would find to tooth world.
It's just a row,

799
00:45:44.461 --> 00:45:46.530
a single row of teeth,
like a saw blade.

800
00:45:47.220 --> 00:45:52.220
And for a hundred plus years if theologists and paleontologists,

801
00:45:52.891 --> 00:45:55.440
we tried to figure out where that tooth world would go.

802
00:45:55.920 --> 00:46:00.720
And so there's all these amazing ancient if theology drawings of that tooth

803
00:46:00.721 --> 00:46:03.930
world on his head,
on his butt,

804
00:46:03.960 --> 00:46:08.760
on his tail as a dorsal fin,
like side Sob fins,
you know,

805
00:46:08.761 --> 00:46:13.740
sideways,
all sorts of crazy stuff.
And it's really only,
um,

806
00:46:14.190 --> 00:46:19.190
much to my disappointment when I started my tee shirt company in the last five

807
00:46:20.221 --> 00:46:24.360
years,
we've,
we've Kinda got it nailed down that it's stuck in the lower jaw.

808
00:46:24.720 --> 00:46:28.080
It would actually have molars and the top and the saw would come up and there's

809
00:46:28.081 --> 00:46:33.030
just enough kind of cheek bones left in,
I forget what museum had it,

810
00:46:33.360 --> 00:46:38.340
but they did a 3-d Lino recreation of it and it all fit together like a puzzle

811
00:46:38.341 --> 00:46:41.740
piece.
The reason why I say as my disappointment is cause when I started a

812
00:46:41.750 --> 00:46:45.600
conversation,
I drew the healer cooperating with the old school way,

813
00:46:45.601 --> 00:46:50.310
which is almost like the bottom job was like a whip that came around and twirled

814
00:46:50.311 --> 00:46:54.360
around like that.
And it's so,
it's such a common way to depict that,

815
00:46:54.361 --> 00:46:58.860
that it's like in Jurassic Park video games and,
and other stuff.

816
00:47:00.180 --> 00:47:02.820
So I start my teacher comfy,
do the Kickstarter,

817
00:47:03.270 --> 00:47:06.360
I make 120 helicoprian shirts with the kind of whip jaw.

818
00:47:06.840 --> 00:47:10.500
Three months later the latest findings come out and they're like,
hey,
by the way,

819
00:47:11.040 --> 00:47:14.910
it's a buzz saw in the job and it's not even this like giant monsters,

820
00:47:14.911 --> 00:47:18.300
great white look and thing.
It's the kind of a giant rat fish,

821
00:47:18.690 --> 00:47:21.290
which is a relative of the sharks.
It's cartilage dentist.

822
00:47:21.990 --> 00:47:24.390
They're also called ghost sharks.
Um,

823
00:47:24.940 --> 00:47:29.940
kind of like a Dumbo looking elephant of have a little mini shark,

824
00:47:30.700 --> 00:47:35.050
but I like the drum still a little more panache.

825
00:47:35.350 --> 00:47:38.350
Um,
this is the lead seek theories from saying that,
right.

826
00:47:38.860 --> 00:47:42.550
Like the biggest bony fish ever,
um,

827
00:47:42.910 --> 00:47:47.080
bigger than a school bus sent me just 45,
I think maybe 50 feet around there.

828
00:47:47.550 --> 00:47:51.940
Um,
filter feeder,
just super slow,
would cruise around in packs.

829
00:47:52.450 --> 00:47:55.060
Um,
and he was more around in the Mesozoic.

830
00:47:55.160 --> 00:47:58.270
So if I'm remembering right,
uh,

831
00:47:58.300 --> 00:48:01.250
late Triassic maybe around there.
Yeah.

832
00:48:03.220 --> 00:48:07.970
Luckily there's no paleontologists in the crowd.
Like,
well,
yeah.
So,

833
00:48:08.210 --> 00:48:11.800
um,
and the,
you know,
the same,
same deal.
Here's how I figured all that out.

834
00:48:12.160 --> 00:48:13.750
Just working out the different things,

835
00:48:13.900 --> 00:48:17.320
figuring out who I wanted to have the focus on.
Um,

836
00:48:17.740 --> 00:48:19.630
this is the first sketch here.

837
00:48:20.420 --> 00:48:23.080
I was trying to have the big Ol Dunkleosteus in there,

838
00:48:23.081 --> 00:48:26.770
but it got a little crowded,
got more of a figure ass.

839
00:48:26.860 --> 00:48:30.370
And with any composition when I'm trying to do is I'm also trying to guide the

840
00:48:30.371 --> 00:48:35.110
eye through the piece.
Um,
so with these roughs,

841
00:48:35.111 --> 00:48:39.430
you know,
I had pretty much nailed that and figure that out.
Um,
but yeah,

842
00:48:40.690 --> 00:48:45.300
so there's that and I'll show you one more.
This was also a favorite of ours.
Um,

843
00:48:45.370 --> 00:48:48.040
so there's the final of this one.
What's the name of this chapter

844
00:48:50.050 --> 00:48:50.883
from the deep?

845
00:48:51.090 --> 00:48:55.360
So Helen gave me a list of fish,

846
00:48:56.800 --> 00:49:00.420
again,
a mile long,
most of them fresh water,

847
00:49:00.640 --> 00:49:02.110
but from all over the world.

848
00:49:02.170 --> 00:49:05.770
And then one salt water being an aquarium guy,

849
00:49:05.771 --> 00:49:08.050
having owned a fish store and whatnot.

850
00:49:08.530 --> 00:49:12.400
We get really particular about mixing fish from different parts of the world

851
00:49:12.610 --> 00:49:13.390
because if you're doing that,

852
00:49:13.390 --> 00:49:15.920
you're just doing it just to have a fancy looking fish tank.

853
00:49:15.921 --> 00:49:18.880
You're not actually trying to create a bio tope and accurate and your

854
00:49:18.881 --> 00:49:21.640
representation.
So we have Amazon tanks,

855
00:49:21.641 --> 00:49:24.160
we have a Asian river tanks,

856
00:49:24.161 --> 00:49:27.950
we have African Riffe Lake sichlid tanks.
Um,

857
00:49:28.750 --> 00:49:32.350
so she gave me this list of all these different species.
And first it's like,
oh,

858
00:49:32.351 --> 00:49:36.820
we can't do that.
He just,
uh,
you kidding me.
But I gave in.

859
00:49:37.120 --> 00:49:40.810
And so,
um,
originally this was a had fish,
believe it or not,

860
00:49:40.840 --> 00:49:45.840
this thing is not a branch that is a pretty disgusting fish called the Hagfish,

861
00:49:46.780 --> 00:49:49.570
which is slimy and kind of brainless and you know,

862
00:49:50.050 --> 00:49:54.350
maybe a deserves that reputation that you're trying to break with fish.
Um,

863
00:49:54.880 --> 00:49:57.310
there was an image going around on the Internet,
I believe.

864
00:49:57.311 --> 00:50:01.600
Was it this guy where the car was carrying like a,

865
00:50:02.500 --> 00:50:07.240
a slew of these in a big Ben and it's back and then I think the car got in an

866
00:50:07.241 --> 00:50:08.890
accident or the thing tipped over.

867
00:50:08.891 --> 00:50:13.891
And what these guys do is they secrete this totally nasty slime kind of

868
00:50:14.050 --> 00:50:19.050
substance and you can take one and put it in a bucket and it would fill the

869
00:50:19.841 --> 00:50:21.550
bucket with that.

870
00:50:21.550 --> 00:50:26.070
Simon could generate that much kind of the Sliwa like ectoplasm looking,

871
00:50:26.140 --> 00:50:30.550
you know,
Ghostbusters,
um,
kind of,
you know,
substance.
Anyways,
so those,

872
00:50:30.560 --> 00:50:31.191
his car,

873
00:50:31.191 --> 00:50:35.240
it's carrying a whole giant like plastic band probably had like 300 of them.

874
00:50:35.570 --> 00:50:37.670
And the slime completely just took over the car.

875
00:50:37.900 --> 00:50:40.820
It exploded all over is all over the street.
It was all over the cars.

876
00:50:41.240 --> 00:50:43.290
It had looked like something out of Ghostbusters.

877
00:50:43.370 --> 00:50:47.690
Like there's something that just came in and slammed it.
Um,
problem is,
you know,

878
00:50:47.691 --> 00:50:49.040
I liked having him in there.

879
00:50:49.340 --> 00:50:53.410
He's a saltwater and that's all mixed fish from different parts of the Robo and

880
00:50:53.420 --> 00:50:56.930
won't mix the salt water fish with the fresh water fish because my reputation's

881
00:50:56.931 --> 00:51:01.200
on the line here.
So hagfish got taken out.
Um,

882
00:51:01.250 --> 00:51:05.600
but what we have is some really big super strange freshwater fish.

883
00:51:06.020 --> 00:51:09.260
Um,
have you been to cal academy and Golden Gate Park?

884
00:51:09.350 --> 00:51:11.210
There's a big tank full of the alligator Gar.

885
00:51:11.270 --> 00:51:15.930
It's one of my favorite and they get ginormous 10,
12 feet.
Um,

886
00:51:16.040 --> 00:51:20.930
you would find them in actually rather shallow rivers and whatnot and like say

887
00:51:20.931 --> 00:51:24.200
Texas,
um,
we'll find them the Mississippi.

888
00:51:24.201 --> 00:51:28.550
But they're definitely the really common in Texas,
a super slow moving.

889
00:51:29.120 --> 00:51:34.120
They're becoming almost endangered because obviously in Texas this,

890
00:51:34.190 --> 00:51:37.580
this would be a thing.
People like to go hunting with bows and arrows.

891
00:51:38.090 --> 00:51:40.010
So these big guys come up,
you know,

892
00:51:40.020 --> 00:51:41.690
without a care in the world up to the surface.

893
00:51:42.110 --> 00:51:46.100
And dudes come out on boats and yeah,
they pluck them.
So it's,
it's,
yeah,

894
00:51:46.490 --> 00:51:50.210
and it actually has a rope on the arrows of their fishing with the actual arrow.

895
00:51:50.660 --> 00:51:55.340
Um,
so populations are being depleted pretty quick,
which is a tragedy.

896
00:51:56.330 --> 00:51:59.450
Um,
but they're not quite on the endangered list yet,
I don't think.

897
00:52:00.140 --> 00:52:04.430
But I love those guys.
You can see him at the California Academy of Sciences.
Um,

898
00:52:04.520 --> 00:52:08.600
big white sturgeon.
We would get these right here in the bay.
Um,

899
00:52:08.720 --> 00:52:10.190
I grew up in Sacramento.
You would,

900
00:52:10.220 --> 00:52:14.900
you would get these in the delta and Sacramento River.
Um,
they're Nadia missed,

901
00:52:14.930 --> 00:52:18.050
right?
It's the right word to say.
Then a freshwater and salt.

902
00:52:18.110 --> 00:52:20.420
It can kind of go back and forth.
Um,

903
00:52:21.020 --> 00:52:25.970
also would get huge for a long time in Lake Tahoe,
there was rumor of a,

904
00:52:26.210 --> 00:52:30.440
you know,
Taco zone,
sea monster.
They called it a Tessie,
I believe.
And then,

905
00:52:30.460 --> 00:52:33.590
you know,
eventually somebody caught like a 15 foot one of these.

906
00:52:33.700 --> 00:52:38.100
It was just an absolute monster
caviar,
you know,

907
00:52:38.210 --> 00:52:40.370
I guess they're probably pretty good eating there.
They're definitely,

908
00:52:40.371 --> 00:52:43.340
there's a fishery forum,
um,
a good place to see these.

909
00:52:43.341 --> 00:52:46.610
If you go to aquarium in the bay down by pier 39,

910
00:52:46.611 --> 00:52:48.830
which I know is like a pier 39,

911
00:52:49.310 --> 00:52:51.860
but there is a legitimate little aquarium there call aquarium of the bay where I

912
00:52:51.861 --> 00:52:56.450
used to work as a scuba diver and we have a huge population of these and the big

913
00:52:56.451 --> 00:52:57.770
tunnel tanks and they're pretty impressive.

914
00:52:57.860 --> 00:53:02.860
They're like very prehistoric animal right around since the dinosaurs.

915
00:53:03.290 --> 00:53:05.150
Um,
and then these guys,

916
00:53:05.151 --> 00:53:10.151
the paddle fish you'd find like in Missouri based in the northern states,

917
00:53:10.671 --> 00:53:11.810
out in the rivers and lakes,

918
00:53:12.530 --> 00:53:14.930
there's a couple of different quarries that have been populated with and the

919
00:53:14.931 --> 00:53:18.530
divers will go just to see them.
Um,
it's a very strange,

920
00:53:18.590 --> 00:53:21.170
fairly large fish,
um,

921
00:53:21.171 --> 00:53:24.830
kind of built like a shark in a way even though it is totally a freshwater,

922
00:53:24.831 --> 00:53:26.220
bony fish.
Um,

923
00:53:26.240 --> 00:53:30.090
and then it has this really large weird paddle knows that comes out.

924
00:53:30.480 --> 00:53:35.070
They I do think are on the endangered list.
Um,
yeah,
which sucks.

925
00:53:35.100 --> 00:53:39.840
Their habitats are getting wiped out by pollution and damming of the rivers and

926
00:53:39.841 --> 00:53:44.520
whatnot.
Um,
and then we have these guys,

927
00:53:44.580 --> 00:53:45.270
the snakehead,

928
00:53:45.270 --> 00:53:48.690
which you may have heard of because they are super invasive and are getting into

929
00:53:48.691 --> 00:53:53.190
lakes and rivers everywhere and they eat everything.
And there,
Yay big.

930
00:53:53.220 --> 00:53:54.540
If you've watched river monsters,

931
00:53:54.541 --> 00:53:58.040
there's a great episode where that guy goes in and tries to find him a,

932
00:53:58.050 --> 00:54:01.300
he gets bit by one and they're hyper aggressive.
Um,

933
00:54:02.160 --> 00:54:04.340
and they were just kind of taken over,
uh,

934
00:54:04.380 --> 00:54:06.840
don't know why they were introduced or how they got into,

935
00:54:06.841 --> 00:54:10.620
especially up here in North America.
Um,
this is,

936
00:54:10.621 --> 00:54:15.220
we were laughing at this fish cause I call it a biker and Bashir.

937
00:54:15.320 --> 00:54:20.040
Yeah.
Um,
in the,
at least in the California aquarium trade,
we call them bikers.

938
00:54:20.480 --> 00:54:23.640
Um,
and,
uh,
it's an African fish.
Right.

939
00:54:24.450 --> 00:54:28.140
And my cool story about that is when you'd go,

940
00:54:28.410 --> 00:54:31.350
so when I had my fish store,
I'd go to these tropical fish wholesalers,

941
00:54:31.680 --> 00:54:35.520
which are big damn kind of dank warehouses,

942
00:54:35.521 --> 00:54:37.290
but just rows and rows and rows of aquariums.

943
00:54:37.620 --> 00:54:40.530
And that's where the fish doors would go to buyer fish and take it back to the

944
00:54:40.531 --> 00:54:42.650
fish store.
And some of you guys,
um,

945
00:54:42.660 --> 00:54:47.250
a lot of these places have drainage canals that the tanks could just easily be

946
00:54:47.370 --> 00:54:50.130
overflow.
Nobody would,
would worry about water damage or anything.

947
00:54:50.370 --> 00:54:54.060
Concrete floors,
drainage canals where the openings in them.

948
00:54:54.450 --> 00:54:57.750
And what,
what happened a lot is these guys would get out of the tanks,

949
00:54:58.110 --> 00:55:02.640
get into the drainage canals,
not go wash,
get washed out.
They would hang around,

950
00:55:03.210 --> 00:55:05.550
eat whatever else comes down there and get really big.

951
00:55:06.150 --> 00:55:09.660
And so sometimes you'd be at the wholesaler picking up your fish and you'd see

952
00:55:09.661 --> 00:55:12.510
something go down these,
these pipelines,
you know,

953
00:55:12.630 --> 00:55:17.110
with the open where it was open and it was these bikers that are just like

954
00:55:17.160 --> 00:55:21.450
loving life living in this Super Mario tube world.
Um,

955
00:55:22.230 --> 00:55:24.420
so they're cool.
Yeah,
very popular aquarium fish.

956
00:55:24.630 --> 00:55:26.700
And then this guy is the land prey,

957
00:55:26.850 --> 00:55:31.200
which is probably one of the most disgusting parasites,

958
00:55:31.890 --> 00:55:35.750
parasites,
also fresh and salt water back and forth.
Uh,

959
00:55:35.760 --> 00:55:38.780
you'd find them in the American river and the Delta,
um,

960
00:55:39.090 --> 00:55:43.080
other freshwater rivers obviously.
Um,
but also out in the ocean.

961
00:55:43.380 --> 00:55:47.310
And they liked the latch on with this crazy circular mouth.

962
00:55:47.311 --> 00:55:52.140
It's just lined with teeth and kind of like the cookie cutter shark suck a chunk

963
00:55:52.141 --> 00:55:55.530
out or at least just kind of draw blood and protein from the animal until they

964
00:55:55.531 --> 00:55:58.680
could shake them.
Uh,
when salmon are coming up,

965
00:55:58.681 --> 00:56:03.360
the stream to breed lamper is a jumping on those guys and hitching a ride.
Um,

966
00:56:03.930 --> 00:56:08.010
and then last but not least,
these guys are so,
you know,

967
00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:13.140
Texas,
Sacramento,
Missouri,
Africa,

968
00:56:13.230 --> 00:56:17.850
everywhere,
everywhere.
And then she wanted African cyclics,

969
00:56:18.540 --> 00:56:23.240
which are little super colorful fish that live in the rift,
um,

970
00:56:23.530 --> 00:56:28.530
lakes of Africa and also their stick lives in the western rivers of Africa.

971
00:56:28.600 --> 00:56:29.780
But,
um,

972
00:56:30.160 --> 00:56:33.700
there are certain lakes like Lake Malawi where the water's pretty clear and

973
00:56:33.701 --> 00:56:38.701
there are millions and millions of these almost tropical color like saltwater

974
00:56:38.800 --> 00:56:42.130
fish,
um,
little guys called African secludes,

975
00:56:42.310 --> 00:56:45.190
all sorts of from color types,
stripes and spots,

976
00:56:45.550 --> 00:56:49.810
super neon blues and reds and Greens.
Someone was beautiful,

977
00:56:49.811 --> 00:56:54.500
fresh water fish in the world.
I'm just swimming around in the rocky reefs.
Um,

978
00:56:54.760 --> 00:56:56.350
it would make for amazing scuba diving,

979
00:56:56.351 --> 00:57:01.330
but there's also hippos and crocodiles and God knows what else.

980
00:57:01.480 --> 00:57:03.760
So,
um,
African Tiger fish,

981
00:57:03.761 --> 00:57:07.010
I mean all sorts of things that would just ruin your day.
But as a kid,

982
00:57:07.050 --> 00:57:10.120
the reason why these are my favorite and very popular aquarium fish,

983
00:57:10.480 --> 00:57:12.340
if you get into keeping fresh water tanks,

984
00:57:12.610 --> 00:57:16.330
often you would kind of cut your teeth on these guys on because they are so

985
00:57:16.331 --> 00:57:20.290
colorful and they breed and whatnot.
So when I was a kid getting into aquariums,

986
00:57:20.291 --> 00:57:22.990
it'd be like nine years old,
get on my BMX bike,

987
00:57:23.200 --> 00:57:26.980
go down to the local fish store with like a jar of like dimes and nickels and I

988
00:57:26.981 --> 00:57:30.820
would buy one of these fish,
bring it home.

989
00:57:31.690 --> 00:57:34.900
They're hyper aggressive.
So I throw it,
not really knowing that yet,

990
00:57:34.901 --> 00:57:36.460
learning about all this stuff,

991
00:57:36.760 --> 00:57:40.060
throw it in my tank of Tetra is another kind of angel fish and watch it just

992
00:57:40.720 --> 00:57:41.980
massacre everybody.

993
00:57:42.370 --> 00:57:46.720
So I ended up with just one fish that would just dominate and then I go,
okay,

994
00:57:46.721 --> 00:57:50.380
well I guess I'm going to keep African cichlids now it's like go get more.

995
00:57:50.381 --> 00:57:53.370
And you know,
with every bag of chance I could scratch together.
Um,

996
00:57:53.410 --> 00:57:57.220
but super cool,
completely out of place.
In this lineup of fish,

997
00:57:57.540 --> 00:58:01.060
but for Helen,
I would do it.
Yeah.
So,

998
00:58:01.090 --> 00:58:03.160
and that's kind of how we would come up with the drawings.

999
00:58:03.161 --> 00:58:06.830
There's eight or nine other ones in there.
Um,
and the book,

1000
00:58:06.831 --> 00:58:11.050
she also tells really cool,
like folktales the fish from around the world.

1001
00:58:11.051 --> 00:58:13.870
And I would add a small kind of spirals,
Trish in each one.

1002
00:58:14.210 --> 00:58:18.850
And those are a lot of fun to read.
Um,
but yeah.
Cool.
And that's pretty much,

1003
00:58:18.880 --> 00:58:21.250
that's how it all comes about three,
it's late nights,

1004
00:58:21.290 --> 00:58:25.030
a lot of coffee and sitting there and you know,
hoping she likes it.

1005
00:58:25.340 --> 00:58:30.230
<v 2>I do.
I really do.
Yeah,
so much.
Thank you so much.
That's awesome.
Yeah.</v>

1006
00:58:31.010 --> 00:58:35.000
Cool.
Okay,
well I will say thank you to all of you for coming.

1007
00:58:35.001 --> 00:58:39.110
Thank you so much to Aja for being here and sharing insights that no one else

1008
00:58:39.111 --> 00:58:43.440
has had before.
I think that was exclusive,
well,
the odd of Ivus whole.
So,

1009
00:58:43.720 --> 00:58:48.080
um,
thank you.
Yeah.
Thank you so much for coming into enjoying off fish.
Wild.

1010
00:58:48.320 --> 00:58:50.910
Thanks.
Yeah.

1011
00:58:54.130 --> 00:58:58.300
<v 1>Any questions?
Anyone in the room?
Q and a?</v>

1012
00:58:58.950 --> 00:59:02.540
Anyone?
No worries.
No questions on the dory.
Yeah,

1013
00:59:02.750 --> 00:59:04.080
I'll read one of the questions from the door.

1014
00:59:04.090 --> 00:59:06.510
So we have online questions from the live stream.

1015
00:59:06.930 --> 00:59:10.690
I am interested to know how fishes pick their partners in the wild.

1016
00:59:11.180 --> 00:59:14.530
Are they generally monogamous?
And also what is your favorite fish?

1017
00:59:14.720 --> 00:59:17.550
<v 2>Oh,
the favorite fish question.
I love,
do you?
Uh,</v>

1018
00:59:17.570 --> 00:59:20.840
I've had it like four times now from kids and adults alike and it's really hard

1019
00:59:20.841 --> 00:59:24.480
to,
because there's 30,000 species to choose from.
Uh,

1020
00:59:24.500 --> 00:59:28.070
so I kind of have a daily favorite.
Um,
uh,

1021
00:59:28.071 --> 00:59:31.270
the moment I think my favorite is I think all the mandarin fish,
which is,
uh,

1022
00:59:31.670 --> 00:59:35.730
the only one of two animals in the world that have the blue pigment in them.
Uh,

1023
00:59:35.990 --> 00:59:38.510
every other blue was a structural color.
So Butterfly Wings,

1024
00:59:38.511 --> 00:59:41.420
it's the same reason that the sky is blue and that rainbows or blue,

1025
00:59:41.421 --> 00:59:44.360
it's the way they sort of physical interaction with the structure of the

1026
00:59:44.361 --> 00:59:45.680
material,
not a pigment.

1027
00:59:46.010 --> 00:59:49.670
And the only blue pigments I've been found in these beautiful fish,
which also,

1028
00:59:49.720 --> 00:59:52.610
uh,
um,
oh,
I think they are not monogamous,

1029
00:59:52.611 --> 00:59:54.530
but the males dance each night for the females.

1030
00:59:54.531 --> 00:59:57.170
And they have this wonderful kind of display.
Uh,

1031
00:59:57.171 --> 01:00:01.460
so the female will choose the male,
um,
based on his,
you know,

1032
01:00:01.461 --> 01:00:03.620
colors and dancing abilities.

1033
01:00:03.650 --> 01:00:07.010
So often it is the males in the fish that are having to show off to the females,

1034
01:00:07.340 --> 01:00:10.520
um,
and the females will choose.
And in fact,

1035
01:00:10.521 --> 01:00:13.430
there's a whole bunch of stuff in the chapter I write about color,

1036
01:00:13.760 --> 01:00:18.760
I'm talking about guppies and how they have evolved to be incredibly colorful,

1037
01:00:18.861 --> 01:00:21.710
but it's a real trade off between sex and danger.

1038
01:00:22.040 --> 01:00:25.630
And in their native habitats in Trinidad,
in the Caribbean,

1039
01:00:25.640 --> 01:00:28.470
they live in these little pools that have different levels of danger.

1040
01:00:28.471 --> 01:00:30.800
Some of them have loads of predators and some of them don't.

1041
01:00:31.040 --> 01:00:34.340
And in the pools with scientists basically realized that the pools with

1042
01:00:34.341 --> 01:00:38.270
predators had less colorful fish and then the ones that were safe and don't,

1043
01:00:38.300 --> 01:00:42.290
and then experiments show that it only takes about 18 months in captive

1044
01:00:42.291 --> 01:00:44.840
conditions and controlled conditions to change their colors.

1045
01:00:44.840 --> 01:00:48.680
So you take away the predators and the evil and the congeners patients become

1046
01:00:48.681 --> 01:00:52.760
more colorful because you don't want to be bright and sort of stand out if

1047
01:00:52.761 --> 01:00:53.750
there's things are going to eat you,

1048
01:00:54.020 --> 01:00:57.410
but you want to be colorful enough for a female to come and meet with you.

1049
01:00:57.411 --> 01:01:01.100
So this is sort of trade off between the two and some fish are monogamous,

1050
01:01:01.101 --> 01:01:04.400
aren't they?
I mean I'm seahorses,
I think parent for life and various others.

1051
01:01:04.401 --> 01:01:04.981
I think some of the sick,

1052
01:01:04.981 --> 01:01:08.690
let's do as well that can be quite quite good at staying in their partners,

1053
01:01:09.200 --> 01:01:11.240
sort of partnerships,
male females and some,

1054
01:01:11.241 --> 01:01:14.450
one of my favorites actually is a thing called the talk bass,
I believe.

1055
01:01:14.451 --> 01:01:16.110
And they're hermaphrodites um,

1056
01:01:16.160 --> 01:01:19.670
but they pair up for life and then about 20 times a day just flip between the

1057
01:01:19.671 --> 01:01:23.840
genders and that kind of swap over male,
female,
male,
female.
So it's pretty,

1058
01:01:23.841 --> 01:01:24.674
pretty cool.

1059
01:01:30.460 --> 01:01:33.730
<v 6>So,
uh,
thanks for sharing insight into these animals.</v>

1060
01:01:33.790 --> 01:01:36.130
A love than we would never get to see otherwise.
Uh,

1061
01:01:36.220 --> 01:01:38.860
but actually seeing them in person is really super cool.

1062
01:01:38.861 --> 01:01:42.760
And I'm assuming based on your photography that you've done some diving and I,

1063
01:01:42.820 --> 01:01:45.640
I think you mentioned that you're diving is,

1064
01:01:45.880 --> 01:01:49.930
is there like a favorite place you've dove or a like a dream location that you

1065
01:01:49.931 --> 01:01:52.900
would want to dive or someplace you'd recommend that people check out?

1066
01:01:53.950 --> 01:01:57.540
<v 2>I don't sent me do,
I don't know if you do.
I do.
You go for it.
Um,</v>

1067
01:01:58.180 --> 01:02:01.720
so yeah,
I do dive in.
It's really how I got into all of this in the first place.

1068
01:02:01.721 --> 01:02:04.310
I learned to drive and I was a teenager in England,
um,

1069
01:02:04.480 --> 01:02:08.290
which definitely wasn't clear and beautiful and full of lots of fish,

1070
01:02:08.291 --> 01:02:12.340
but it got me into it anyway.
And um,
but since then I've worked in,

1071
01:02:12.341 --> 01:02:14.620
researched and dived all around the world,
which has been a wonderful,

1072
01:02:14.950 --> 01:02:16.240
but actually when I was writing the book,

1073
01:02:16.241 --> 01:02:18.340
I had chance to go on a big long trip around the world.

1074
01:02:18.370 --> 01:02:22.380
I was actually first port call was here in California and Aja and I met a couple

1075
01:02:22.380 --> 01:02:23.490
of years ago for the first time,
which was great.

1076
01:02:23.910 --> 01:02:26.400
And then we carried on my husband and I carried on traveling around the world

1077
01:02:26.640 --> 01:02:30.180
and as much diving as we could and watching fish and kind of getting ideas for

1078
01:02:30.181 --> 01:02:30.930
this book.

1079
01:02:30.930 --> 01:02:34.770
And the final place we dived is a place I've wanted to go for two for a really

1080
01:02:34.771 --> 01:02:39.270
long time,
which is the island of Palau in the Pacific,
which is a sort of,

1081
01:02:39.300 --> 01:02:41.880
if you flew from here to Guam and then you carry on another one,

1082
01:02:41.881 --> 01:02:42.960
it's sort of out that way.

1083
01:02:43.590 --> 01:02:48.210
And I'd always heard about Palau is being like the divers scuba divers heaven.

1084
01:02:48.390 --> 01:02:52.020
It's now very strongly protected from over fishing that we've summit to be

1085
01:02:52.021 --> 01:02:54.420
beautiful.
And I had huge,

1086
01:02:54.660 --> 01:02:57.870
hugely high expectations for it and was kind of nervous that it would,

1087
01:02:57.930 --> 01:02:59.580
whether it would fulfill that.
There's also,

1088
01:02:59.581 --> 01:03:02.790
this was 2016 when there was a big heat wave that was coral bleaching going on

1089
01:03:02.791 --> 01:03:07.500
all over the world.
Plow had been hit by drought.
Um,
but,

1090
01:03:08.010 --> 01:03:12.550
uh,
it was fantastic.
It was absolutely blew me out of the water.

1091
01:03:12.551 --> 01:03:17.430
It just big old beautiful fish,
um,
that I hadn't seen for years.
Um,

1092
01:03:17.490 --> 01:03:21.750
or really ever in that kind of density of fish.
I studied for my phd,

1093
01:03:21.751 --> 01:03:25.590
which in the location I studied at in Malaysia and not being fished out and

1094
01:03:25.591 --> 01:03:27.400
they'd all gone,
but I saw them in Palau,

1095
01:03:27.401 --> 01:03:29.400
have these things called Hump headdress and huge numbers.

1096
01:03:29.820 --> 01:03:33.960
The risa beautiful and just extraordinary place for just like,
yeah,

1097
01:03:34.170 --> 01:03:38.420
sort of heaven,
not under,
under the sea really.
So yeah,
definitely go there,
right?

1098
01:03:38.750 --> 01:03:39.430
Yeah.

1099
01:03:39.430 --> 01:03:41.560
<v 4>Yeah.
So I mentioned I dove with the aquarium,</v>

1100
01:03:41.680 --> 01:03:45.460
Kramer the bay for a couple of years as a professional diver.

1101
01:03:45.461 --> 01:03:48.310
Then I dove at Cal Academy and go and get park and all this tanks.

1102
01:03:48.730 --> 01:03:53.290
I even dove at the rain forest cafe as a job for a short minute,

1103
01:03:53.620 --> 01:03:58.600
um,
which was pretty miserable,
but uh,
you know,
it paid the bills for a while.
Um,

1104
01:03:59.350 --> 01:04:00.970
and I got certified,
I was 16,

1105
01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:05.590
and growing up in Sacramento I was so obviously fish obsessed,

1106
01:04:05.770 --> 01:04:09.430
obsessed with the ocean that I would dive in the American river,

1107
01:04:09.940 --> 01:04:14.800
which ran through my suburban neighborhood of kind of Carmichael.
Um,

1108
01:04:15.040 --> 01:04:19.480
and you can imagine it was dreary and super cold and high current.

1109
01:04:19.481 --> 01:04:23.920
And I wouldn't be able to see you,
you know,
I a five or six feet visibility,

1110
01:04:24.340 --> 01:04:26.640
but we would get,
um,

1111
01:04:27.130 --> 01:04:31.600
we'd get striped bass of him from the ocean and we'd get shad.

1112
01:04:31.720 --> 01:04:35.740
And if I was super lucky,
had maybe see a surgeon,
but there a couple of times I,

1113
01:04:35.860 --> 01:04:39.490
I thought I saw like the big tail of one,
but I had startled as I came up on it,

1114
01:04:39.491 --> 01:04:42.640
you know,
which also started meetings anytime when you're dark,

1115
01:04:42.700 --> 01:04:47.020
murky water and something big comes at you,
there's always a moment.
Um,

1116
01:04:47.590 --> 01:04:51.940
so in some ways those kind of crummy dive spots where I'm like going through

1117
01:04:51.941 --> 01:04:56.050
like shopping carts and like I beams of the old bridge that I'm diving

1118
01:04:56.051 --> 01:04:58.630
underneath and all that kind of stuff are actually really nostalgic.

1119
01:04:58.631 --> 01:04:59.141
And you know,

1120
01:04:59.141 --> 01:05:03.850
kind of part of my favorite spots of all the spots I've dove from the

1121
01:05:03.851 --> 01:05:07.780
Philippines to Monterrey and Mexico,
like cozy metal stuff.
Um,

1122
01:05:08.260 --> 01:05:10.510
my all time favorite is Catalina island.

1123
01:05:10.990 --> 01:05:15.990
So an hour boat ride out of long beach and there's literally like an oceanic

1124
01:05:16.331 --> 01:05:20.230
paradise.
Um,
for me,
the best California diving,

1125
01:05:20.680 --> 01:05:24.340
it's warm enough that you don't feel like you're going to die after half an hour

1126
01:05:24.341 --> 01:05:29.200
of being underwater.
Um,
but because it's still temperate waters,

1127
01:05:29.201 --> 01:05:33.640
you know,
it's mid sixties,
you get a lot of the cool cold water species.

1128
01:05:33.930 --> 01:05:34.330
Um,

1129
01:05:34.330 --> 01:05:37.990
and you also get kelp force and live in the visibility there as much better than

1130
01:05:37.991 --> 01:05:41.890
Monterey,
which generally is on the best day,
10 or 15 feet.

1131
01:05:42.250 --> 01:05:44.470
Catalina it could be as much as 40 or 50.

1132
01:05:44.950 --> 01:05:49.950
Super blue and I cathedrals of giant Kelp coming up and over a giant Black Sea

1133
01:05:50.501 --> 01:05:52.590
bass decides the car's almost.
At least they,

1134
01:05:52.640 --> 01:05:54.130
they look like it when they come up on Ya.

1135
01:05:54.550 --> 01:05:57.580
Leopard Sharks Breeding and cruising around and the kelp,

1136
01:05:58.330 --> 01:06:02.500
occasionally a blue sharks and soup fin sharks,
smooth hound,

1137
01:06:02.930 --> 01:06:06.460
um,
giant balls of anchovies that are the size of a house.

1138
01:06:06.490 --> 01:06:08.310
They just block out the sun.
Um,

1139
01:06:08.770 --> 01:06:11.890
so that's my all time favorite spot,

1140
01:06:12.220 --> 01:06:16.930
but I haven't been as many spots that she has.
We'll see.

Cute.
Cool.

1143
01:06:30.090 --> 01:06:30.923
