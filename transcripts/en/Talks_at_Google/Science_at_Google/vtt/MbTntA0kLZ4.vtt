1
00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.090
All right.
Thanks for coming folks.
I'm really pleased to be here.
Um,

2
00:00:15.091 --> 00:00:16.440
so I'm going to give you a,

3
00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.130
a whistle stop tour of a lot of the themes and stories that are in the book.
Um,

4
00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.180
and this will go on for about half an hour and then we can have some questions

5
00:00:24.181 --> 00:00:25.290
later.
Okay.

6
00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.380
So I'm going to start by taking it back in time to 1675 to 350 years ago and to

7
00:00:33.061 --> 00:00:38.061
Delft air town in the Netherlands where a man named Anthony Van Leuven hoke is

8
00:00:38.311 --> 00:00:42.930
about to change the world.
Uh,
this man is not a scholar.

9
00:00:42.931 --> 00:00:46.230
He has no scientific training at all,
but he does have two qualities,

10
00:00:46.231 --> 00:00:47.340
are incredibly important.

11
00:00:47.341 --> 00:00:52.341
He has an insatiable curiosity about the world around him and he has the world's

12
00:00:52.831 --> 00:00:56.010
most powerful microscopes.
He makes them himself.

13
00:00:56.011 --> 00:01:00.430
He grinds these impossibly perfect spherical lenses.
Um,

14
00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.920
and he sandwiches them between two brass plates to create this object that looks

15
00:01:04.921 --> 00:01:06.840
a little bit like a glorified door hinge,

16
00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.730
but it does in fact magnify objects 10 times better than anything else that

17
00:01:11.731 --> 00:01:12.870
exist at the time.

18
00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:17.940
And 11 hope turns them on to everything he can find at the time onto bits of

19
00:01:17.941 --> 00:01:21.300
animals and bitter plants onto water that he,

20
00:01:21.301 --> 00:01:26.301
that has collected in an urn outside his house into water from canals and lakes

21
00:01:26.521 --> 00:01:29.130
in Delft and everywhere he looks,

22
00:01:29.131 --> 00:01:32.550
he sees tiny little organisms,

23
00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:37.410
microscopic creatures that none till then no one knew existed.

24
00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:42.060
He was the first person in all of history to see,
um,
to,

25
00:01:42.061 --> 00:01:46.470
to see bacteria with his own eyes and to know that they exist.

26
00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:51.320
And that must've been a truly momentous point of time,
um,
in,

27
00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:52.550
in science,
in our,

28
00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.180
the history of the world to know that these creatures that are everywhere we're

29
00:01:57.181 --> 00:01:58.110
actually around.

30
00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.380
He realizes that there are more organisms living in a drop of water or in the

31
00:02:03.691 --> 00:02:05.700
dental plaque that collects in his teeth.

32
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.980
Then there are people in the entirety of the Netherlands.
Now,

33
00:02:10.981 --> 00:02:15.030
was he disgusted by this?
Was He revolted by it?
Actually,
no,

34
00:02:15.031 --> 00:02:19.380
he was really excited to learn that his body was full of all these other living

35
00:02:19.381 --> 00:02:20.214
things.

36
00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:25.280
The idea that microbes are synonymous with disease and dirt is actually a more

37
00:02:27.751 --> 00:02:29.190
recent one.
Um,

38
00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:34.250
it came a few centuries after live hope when scientists discovered in very quick

39
00:02:34.561 --> 00:02:37.680
succession that many of the most infamous plagues of humanity,

40
00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:42.360
things like actual plague,
leprosy,
gonorrhea,
syphilis,
cholera,

41
00:02:42.361 --> 00:02:46.650
tuberculosis,
all of these diseases were caused by bacteria.

42
00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.540
And so they forever became known as germs.
They became costs as villains,

43
00:02:51.541 --> 00:02:55.980
as antagonists,
that we needed to destroy less.
They destroy us first.

44
00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.680
Well,
at this point of view is deeply wrong.

45
00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:04.030
It's unfair because only a few hundred kinds of microbes are known to cause

46
00:03:04.031 --> 00:03:08.320
disease.
The vast majority are either benign or beneficial to us,

47
00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:10.750
and in fact,
they are the lords of the planet.

48
00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:15.040
They have been around for much longer than we have and they run the show.

49
00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:20.640
So for we consider the length of this desk to be representative of the entire

50
00:03:21.281 --> 00:03:22.330
history of the planet.

51
00:03:22.331 --> 00:03:26.800
So the earth was created here and that we are now here.

52
00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:30.700
Then humans evolved here.

53
00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:33.010
Uh,

54
00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:38.010
the dinosaurs ruled around here all the multicellular life that,

55
00:03:39.191 --> 00:03:39.701
you know,

56
00:03:39.701 --> 00:03:44.590
the animals and plants and so on revolved around here and microbes,

57
00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:48.430
the first living things,
bacteria evolved to here.

58
00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:53.290
So for the vast majority of life on earth,
it was entirely microscopic.

59
00:03:53.291 --> 00:03:55.630
You were not as being able to see it with your naked eyes,

60
00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:58.780
which would have been fine because eyes only evolved here.

61
00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:06.100
Okay?
So we are all just the icing on this grand microbial cake.

62
00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:10.390
Um,
animals evolved in a world that was already full of and dominated by microbes

63
00:04:10.391 --> 00:04:12.040
and we came to live with them.

64
00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:17.280
We evolved to exploit them and we evolved to crucially depend upon them.

65
00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:20.350
Uh,
every human today,

66
00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:25.620
all of us contain around 39 trillion microbial cells in our bodies,

67
00:04:26.171 --> 00:04:29.080
roughly one for each of our actual human cells.

68
00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:33.580
So we are all merely half the people we think we are.
Um,

69
00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:38.320
this is a sponge among the simplest of animals.

70
00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:42.160
It's just a couple of cell layers.
Sandwiching a bit of Jelly,

71
00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:45.220
but it too is home to a thriving microbiome,

72
00:04:45.221 --> 00:04:50.050
a community of bacteria and other microbes.
Every ENT,

73
00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:54.580
even though it lives in a colony of millions,
is in fact a colony in itself.

74
00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:57.790
A polar bear that walked solo through the Arctic.

75
00:04:57.791 --> 00:05:02.791
Tundra is in fact completely surrounded bar headed geese fly microbes.

76
00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:05.140
To the top of the Himalayas.
Sperm whales,

77
00:05:05.141 --> 00:05:09.610
dive them down into the deepest oceans and when these people set foot on the

78
00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:12.910
moon,
they were also taking a giant step for microbe kind.

79
00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:17.830
These little organisms are not just stowaways,

80
00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:19.630
they're not just hitchhikers and our bodies,

81
00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:23.710
they also confer incredible abilities to their hosts.

82
00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:27.430
This adorable creature is the Hawaiian bobtail squid.

83
00:05:27.431 --> 00:05:29.440
It could fit in the palm of my hand.

84
00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:34.540
It has glowing bacteria in its undersides that shine light below the squid and

85
00:05:34.541 --> 00:05:38.800
that like perfectly matches the moonlight welling down on top of the animal so

86
00:05:38.801 --> 00:05:42.490
that any Predator looking at the squid from below cannot make out its
silhouette.

87
00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:47.730
This squared has an invisibility cloak created by bacteria light more

88
00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:49.001
sinisterly.

89
00:05:49.001 --> 00:05:54.001
These little white worms kill insects by vomiting toxic bacteria into their

90
00:05:54.551 --> 00:05:56.710
bodies.
This bird,

91
00:05:56.711 --> 00:06:01.711
the hippo paints its eggs in antibiotic producing bacteria that stopped the

92
00:06:01.941 --> 00:06:04.130
chicks within the eggs from catching disease.

93
00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:09.140
The spotted Hyena writes an autobiography in bacterial pastes.

94
00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:11.990
It has microbes in scent glands in its backside.

95
00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:16.790
Those product produce odors that match the hyenas sex age,

96
00:06:16.791 --> 00:06:18.680
species,
and social status.

97
00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:22.100
And this long worm called Perico 10 Ula.

98
00:06:22.101 --> 00:06:27.101
A flatworm can regenerate almost its entire body as long as it has some of those

99
00:06:28.101 --> 00:06:30.230
dark colored microbes within it.

100
00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:36.440
Humans to rely on our microbiome for all sorts of things.

101
00:06:36.441 --> 00:06:41.330
They help us to digest our food.
They help to build and shape our organs.

102
00:06:41.331 --> 00:06:44.120
They helped to train and calibrate our immune systems.

103
00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:47.810
They might even help to cha affect our behavior.

104
00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:52.430
So I've been writing about this topic for about 10 years and there are a few

105
00:06:52.431 --> 00:06:57.260
areas of biology that fascinate me more because it totally subverts our

106
00:06:57.261 --> 00:06:59.270
understanding of the life around us.

107
00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:02.950
I have been fascinated by natural history since I was a kid.
Um,

108
00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:07.680
I went to zoos a lot.
This is a picture of me with a kid on my back.
Um,

109
00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:12.880
and I watched David Attenborough documentaries and I read wildlife books and I

110
00:07:12.951 --> 00:07:16.700
came to realize through writing this book and through Reese port reporting on

111
00:07:16.701 --> 00:07:20.510
this topic,
that when I go to a zoo,
every visitor and resident,

112
00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:22.490
there is a zoo in their own right.

113
00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:26.150
When I look at the world around me at all the animals and plants,

114
00:07:26.151 --> 00:07:30.050
I see all of that is profoundly influenced by things I cannot see.

115
00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:33.860
And that without knowing them,
without understanding the microbes around us,

116
00:07:33.861 --> 00:07:37.670
we cannot really understand ourselves and indeed without,

117
00:07:37.671 --> 00:07:39.680
when we look at the microbial world,

118
00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:44.660
very familiar and everyday parts of our lives take on this unfamiliar and newly

119
00:07:44.661 --> 00:07:48.440
wondrous,
uh,
quality.
So for example,

120
00:07:48.770 --> 00:07:53.120
breastfeeding seems like a way of nourishing a baby and it is,

121
00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:54.680
but not entirely.
So,

122
00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:59.120
because some 10% of breast milk consist of these sugars called human milk

123
00:07:59.121 --> 00:08:04.040
oligosaccharides or just hrms,
which babies cannot digest.

124
00:08:04.310 --> 00:08:08.420
Those sugars are there to nourish microbes in the baby's gut and particularly

125
00:08:08.421 --> 00:08:11.300
strains like that one at the bottom be infantis,

126
00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:16.160
which has evolved to specifically digest those sugars with incredible
efficiency.

127
00:08:16.910 --> 00:08:19.970
And when it does that in nourishes the baby's gut cells,

128
00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:23.630
it seals up the lining of the gut and it reduces inflammation.

129
00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:28.840
So a breastfeeding mother is not just nourishing infants,
but in fantasy too.

130
00:08:28.841 --> 00:08:32.780
She is building an entire world inside her baby's body.

131
00:08:32.781 --> 00:08:37.781
She is creating an ecosystem and that ecosystem helps to create us in turn,

132
00:08:39.950 --> 00:08:40.970
so every animal,

133
00:08:41.540 --> 00:08:45.710
whether a hawk or a hummingbird or a human develops from a single fertilized egg

134
00:08:45.770 --> 00:08:47.330
into a full adult body,

135
00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:51.740
and that process doesn't just unfold under our own steam,

136
00:08:51.741 --> 00:08:54.860
under instructions encoded within our own genes.

137
00:08:55.170 --> 00:08:59.910
It also depends on conversations and negotiations with the microbes that live

138
00:08:59.911 --> 00:09:00.744
within us.

139
00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:06.330
Here is an example of an animal that utterly depends on microbes to complete its

140
00:09:06.331 --> 00:09:09.600
life cycle.
These little tubes are very tiny,

141
00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:14.630
but they can get so dense that they clog the propellers of ships and underwater

142
00:09:14.731 --> 00:09:18.570
surfaces.
They're created by a small marine worm.

143
00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:23.220
That one can only make the tubes if it becomes an adult and it can only become

144
00:09:23.221 --> 00:09:27.030
an adult if it encounters the right bacteria in its environment.

145
00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:30.900
If for some reason all the microbes in the ocean were to suddenly disappear,

146
00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:34.410
this one would be all of these ones would die within a generation.

147
00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:37.740
They would never be able to complete their lives.

148
00:09:38.670 --> 00:09:42.540
More familiar creatures like mice or fish or humans or flies.

149
00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:47.700
Also rely on microbes throughout their entire lives to build and shape their

150
00:09:47.701 --> 00:09:48.534
bodies.

151
00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:52.500
And we know this because of rodents like this one that I am sort of holding.

152
00:09:52.770 --> 00:09:54.630
This is a germ free mouse.

153
00:09:54.690 --> 00:09:58.380
It has been raised in this sterile plastic bubble for its entire life.

154
00:09:58.770 --> 00:10:03.330
And it has one of the few creatures in the world that has no microbiome of its

155
00:10:03.331 --> 00:10:05.340
own.
It does not contain multitudes.

156
00:10:05.370 --> 00:10:09.900
It is like a silhouette that hasn't been filled in.
And because of that,

157
00:10:10.350 --> 00:10:15.120
it's body has all kinds of problems.
It's bones don't develop properly.

158
00:10:15.121 --> 00:10:17.580
It's blood vessels,
it's gut,
it's brain.

159
00:10:17.610 --> 00:10:22.610
All of these things are improperly formed because it lacks that connection to

160
00:10:23.161 --> 00:10:24.180
the microbial world.

161
00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:25.740
<v 2>Okay?</v>

162
00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:28.440
<v 0>So microbes shape and sculpt our bodies,</v>

163
00:10:28.470 --> 00:10:33.160
but they also help to keep those bodies safe and healthy.
Um,

164
00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:38.280
the immune system we traditionally think of as this militaristic force that

165
00:10:38.281 --> 00:10:41.220
defends us against the microbial world,
that census,

166
00:10:41.221 --> 00:10:45.420
anything that is other or nonself and that six and destroys it.

167
00:10:46.290 --> 00:10:47.700
But that metaphor is,

168
00:10:47.701 --> 00:10:52.530
is very wrong because we know that actually microbes help to build parts of the

169
00:10:52.531 --> 00:10:53.364
immune system.

170
00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:58.260
They stimulate the growth of different types of immune cells and they calibrate

171
00:10:58.261 --> 00:11:02.850
the immune system so that it reacts to infectious threats and keeps us healthy.

172
00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:06.560
But it also doesn't overreact to harmless things in the world.

173
00:11:06.561 --> 00:11:11.100
US roundness to dust and pollen and allergens and our food.

174
00:11:11.950 --> 00:11:16.920
Um,
and it turns out that the immune system doesn't just indiscriminately kill

175
00:11:16.921 --> 00:11:21.600
microbes.
It actually tolerated the ones that live in our bodies and help us.

176
00:11:21.890 --> 00:11:23.730
Um,
it selects for them.

177
00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:27.270
It decides which species get to live with us and where they get to live.

178
00:11:27.690 --> 00:11:30.420
So forget the militaristic analogies I like to think of.

179
00:11:30.421 --> 00:11:34.530
The immune system is more as a set of ranges in a national park that are trying

180
00:11:34.531 --> 00:11:36.150
to care for the species in the park,

181
00:11:36.151 --> 00:11:40.590
but decide what their population size should be that chuck out invaders.

182
00:11:43.350 --> 00:11:46.530
And finally,
microbes also shape our behavior.

183
00:11:47.130 --> 00:11:50.550
There've been many studies in mice in some of those germ free rodents I showed

184
00:11:50.551 --> 00:11:51.061
you before,

185
00:11:51.061 --> 00:11:55.630
showing that the microbes that live in our can affect the way we think.

186
00:11:55.870 --> 00:11:59.410
They're our resilience to stress,
our susceptibility to anxiety,

187
00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:02.170
aspects of our mood and our personality.

188
00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:06.640
Whether that applies to humans or not is still being checked out,

189
00:12:06.940 --> 00:12:08.380
but it's entirely plausible,

190
00:12:08.381 --> 00:12:12.310
almost probable because all of these aspects of our lives,

191
00:12:12.311 --> 00:12:15.610
all of these corners of our biology that we think of as the province of

192
00:12:15.611 --> 00:12:20.170
individuals,
digestion,
development,
immunity,
health,
thought.

193
00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:22.930
All of these things happen in conversation.

194
00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:27.490
They happen in partnerships with the things that share our lives and over an

195
00:12:27.491 --> 00:12:30.490
individual lifespan.
Those partnerships certainly matter,

196
00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:34.300
but they also matter over much longer timescales,

197
00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:38.110
over evolutionary time spans time and again,

198
00:12:38.230 --> 00:12:43.230
we have seen that microbes can influence the evolutionary potential of different

199
00:12:43.721 --> 00:12:44.470
animal groups,

200
00:12:44.470 --> 00:12:49.210
allowing them to take up opportunities that would be otherwise denied to them to

201
00:12:49.211 --> 00:12:52.600
succeed in lifestyles that they would otherwise fail at.

202
00:12:53.980 --> 00:12:57.940
These are good examples.
These three insects,
aphids,
Cicada,

203
00:12:58.030 --> 00:13:03.030
leafhopper are all part of a group of SAP sucking bugs that drink the fluids

204
00:13:03.281 --> 00:13:04.180
from plants.

205
00:13:04.570 --> 00:13:08.950
And they can only do that because they have bacteria living inside their cells

206
00:13:09.220 --> 00:13:13.090
that provide them with nutrients that are missing from that diet of plants,

207
00:13:13.100 --> 00:13:16.720
apps that act as living dietary supplements.

208
00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:18.400
Without those microbes,

209
00:13:18.430 --> 00:13:22.810
these insects would be totally unable to eat the foods that they eat because it

210
00:13:22.811 --> 00:13:26.740
will be too impoverished for them.
They would all die.
And these groups,

211
00:13:26.750 --> 00:13:30.700
this group of insects is radiated,
uh,
to some 85,000 species.

212
00:13:30.701 --> 00:13:35.701
An extraordinary example of success or founded on that bacterial assistance in

213
00:13:37.601 --> 00:13:41.020
the deep oceans that are other animals that take that concept to an even greater

214
00:13:41.021 --> 00:13:45.250
degree.
These are giant tube worms similar to the ones I showed you before,

215
00:13:45.251 --> 00:13:46.720
but meters in length.

216
00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:50.440
And with these beautiful red gills that look like a tube of lipstick that's been

217
00:13:50.441 --> 00:13:54.760
pushed out or the way they live in areas in parts of the world,

218
00:13:54.820 --> 00:13:59.680
like hydrothermal vents where there is no food or at least meager amount of it.

219
00:13:59.710 --> 00:14:03.850
And yet they flourish in huge numbers and they do that because they have

220
00:14:03.851 --> 00:14:08.560
bacteria in their bodies that use minerals from the vent environment,

221
00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:13.920
break them down and use them to make any news and to make food for the worms.

222
00:14:14.380 --> 00:14:18.970
Those bacteria provide this animal with all of its sustenance to the extent that

223
00:14:18.971 --> 00:14:23.290
it has lost its mouth.
It's gut.
It's entire digestive system.

224
00:14:23.590 --> 00:14:26.950
This thing doesn't need to eat because it has bacteria to provide it with all

225
00:14:26.951 --> 00:14:27.940
the energy it has.

226
00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:33.240
It needs most animals have kept their guts is a good example is he's a

227
00:14:33.701 --> 00:14:38.220
Willdabeast in the African Savanna.
They like other grazing mammals like cows.

228
00:14:38.221 --> 00:14:38.590
Sheep,

229
00:14:38.590 --> 00:14:43.270
goats rely on microbes to break down the complex carbohydrates in the plants,

230
00:14:43.271 --> 00:14:48.100
or they eat substances that they lack the ability to digest on their own,

231
00:14:48.700 --> 00:14:52.340
the bacteria in their bodies,
which how in their guts,

232
00:14:52.341 --> 00:14:55.580
which have been enlarged into these gigantic fermentation chambers,

233
00:14:55.910 --> 00:15:00.470
and those microbes provide them with something like 70% of their energy budget.

234
00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:03.980
Again,
if you somehow destroyed all the microbes in the world,

235
00:15:04.310 --> 00:15:08.990
all of these Hodes would just die.
Okay,

236
00:15:08.991 --> 00:15:13.400
so microbes provide animals with incredible evolutionary opportunities and they

237
00:15:13.401 --> 00:15:17.540
allow them to succeed at things that they would otherwise be unable to cope
with.

238
00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:22.100
They also accelerate the pace of animal evolution.

239
00:15:23.090 --> 00:15:26.930
So if an animal finds a challenge,
it's an in its environment.

240
00:15:26.931 --> 00:15:31.310
The traditional way of dealing with that is to adapt very slowly to accumulate

241
00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:36.260
small changes in its genome and to become good more and more suited to its

242
00:15:36.261 --> 00:15:37.094
environment.

243
00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:41.600
But you can do that very quickly by recruiting microbes that already have those

244
00:15:41.601 --> 00:15:44.630
adaptations that have already met those challenges themselves.

245
00:15:44.930 --> 00:15:49.430
It's a bit like having a skills gap in an organization and rather than training

246
00:15:49.431 --> 00:15:51.740
your existing employees to have those skills,

247
00:15:51.860 --> 00:15:54.260
you just recruit people that already know how to do the job.

248
00:15:55.340 --> 00:15:57.320
This Japanese been bug does that.

249
00:15:57.321 --> 00:16:00.680
It's a major passed in Japan and it's controlled with insecticides,

250
00:16:00.950 --> 00:16:04.520
but it can become instantly resistant to insecticides.

251
00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:09.290
If it swallows the right bacteria in the soil which detoxify those chemicals,

252
00:16:10.250 --> 00:16:12.410
this desert would rat,
can do the same.

253
00:16:12.650 --> 00:16:16.280
It can eat the most common plant in it's desert environment.

254
00:16:16.490 --> 00:16:20.420
If it's all those microbes that can break down the heavy poisons within that

255
00:16:20.421 --> 00:16:21.254
plant.

256
00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:26.540
And these aphids can become resistant to parasitic wasps that would otherwise

257
00:16:26.690 --> 00:16:30.030
lay eggs in their bodies and take over.
Uh,

258
00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:32.550
and they can do that by pop,
by,
uh,

259
00:16:32.570 --> 00:16:37.550
taking up a beneficial microbe from their peers via sex,

260
00:16:37.670 --> 00:16:41.660
which makes this one of the rare cases of a desirable venereal infection.

261
00:16:43.730 --> 00:16:48.730
Humans can benefit from the sorts of transfers to this is a type of seaweed that

262
00:16:50.091 --> 00:16:53.780
has been harvested from Japan for hundreds of years and used is used to make

263
00:16:53.781 --> 00:16:58.130
Nori the stuff that wraps your Sushi,
uh,
nor is now cooked,

264
00:16:58.160 --> 00:16:59.390
but it used to be eaten raw.

265
00:16:59.780 --> 00:17:03.140
And because it used to be it in rural people who swallowed it also swallowed

266
00:17:03.170 --> 00:17:05.870
marine microbes that lived on the seaweed.

267
00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:10.610
And we're exceptionally good at breaking down the unique blends of nutrients and

268
00:17:10.611 --> 00:17:11.750
carbohydrates within.

269
00:17:12.770 --> 00:17:17.330
When those marine microbes entered the guts of people hundreds of years ago,

270
00:17:17.331 --> 00:17:22.310
they met gut microbes and they did a thing that bacteria do all the time.

271
00:17:22.311 --> 00:17:25.790
But that is extraordinary to us.
They swapped genes.

272
00:17:26.360 --> 00:17:27.920
So you and I can only try,

273
00:17:27.970 --> 00:17:31.850
it's pass our genetic material down from parent to child.

274
00:17:32.300 --> 00:17:36.650
But bacteria can do this between individuals horizontally rather than
vertically.

275
00:17:36.651 --> 00:17:41.060
They can cite it a lot to each other and exchange DNA as easily as you or I

276
00:17:41.180 --> 00:17:45.650
might exchange phone numbers or gifts or ideas.
And that's what they did.

277
00:17:45.651 --> 00:17:50.610
So the marine microbe passed on genes were breaking down carbohydrates to the

278
00:17:50.611 --> 00:17:54.030
gut microbes and those passed down from person to person,

279
00:17:54.031 --> 00:17:58.470
which is why to the state Japanese people have got microbiomes that are uniquely

280
00:17:58.471 --> 00:18:02.010
qualified to digest the carbohydrates found in Sushi.

281
00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:09.280
Okay,
so,
uh,
microbes are cool.
Microbes are important.
Um,

282
00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:10.740
I hope I've convinced you of that.
Now,

283
00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:15.540
one important thing I need to say is that microbes are not our friends.

284
00:18:15.870 --> 00:18:19.620
Even the one that even the ones that live within us and that have beneficial

285
00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:23.130
sides to them are not necessarily our allies.

286
00:18:23.670 --> 00:18:28.670
And there is the story about friendly bacteria and good microbes that runs

287
00:18:28.951 --> 00:18:32.400
counter to the idea of microbes,
germs,
and his villains.

288
00:18:32.700 --> 00:18:36.600
But I think both of these ideas are equally wrong.
In fact,

289
00:18:36.601 --> 00:18:40.860
we are just another habitat to them,
just like soil or water.

290
00:18:40.890 --> 00:18:45.890
We are just another ecosystem in which they live and while we do benefit from

291
00:18:46.051 --> 00:18:46.950
their presence,

292
00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:51.060
those relationships like any in nature can be tenuous.

293
00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:55.290
So the microbes that live in our gut,
for example,
help to break down our food,

294
00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:57.480
help to train our immune system,
so on.

295
00:18:58.230 --> 00:19:01.290
But if they cross the lining of the gut and enter our blood stream,

296
00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:03.930
they can cause inflammation and sepsis.

297
00:19:03.931 --> 00:19:07.590
They can cause disease for the want of a millimeter.

298
00:19:07.770 --> 00:19:09.900
Our allies can turn into our enemies.

299
00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:13.950
And so there is no such thing as a good microbe or a bad microbe.

300
00:19:14.130 --> 00:19:16.860
In fact to these relationships take work.

301
00:19:16.890 --> 00:19:19.380
We need ways of containing our multitudes.

302
00:19:19.830 --> 00:19:23.190
We have physical barriers to keep them in specific places,

303
00:19:23.191 --> 00:19:25.740
to keep them from crossing the lining of the gut.
For example,

304
00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:28.320
we have the immune system to keep them in line.

305
00:19:28.350 --> 00:19:32.220
We feed them with the right foods so that we nourish species that are going to

306
00:19:32.221 --> 00:19:36.720
be useful to us,
like those sugars in breastmilk nourish be and Vantis.

307
00:19:37.590 --> 00:19:40.560
And when those control measures breakdown as they often do,

308
00:19:40.830 --> 00:19:44.370
our relationships with the microbes that live within us can turn sour.

309
00:19:45.450 --> 00:19:48.960
You can see some of those dynamics at work in coral reefs.

310
00:19:49.380 --> 00:19:53.160
So corals are look like bits of rock,
but they are in fact animals too.

311
00:19:53.310 --> 00:19:58.310
And they also have thriving microbiomes and many of the things that kill corals

312
00:19:58.620 --> 00:20:03.540
around.
Um,
so corals also have competitors things called turf algae,

313
00:20:03.541 --> 00:20:08.370
this kind of scummy seaweed stuff that competes with them for space to coral

314
00:20:08.371 --> 00:20:09.204
versus [inaudible].

315
00:20:09.540 --> 00:20:13.260
A lot of the things that kill corals tip the balance of that war,

316
00:20:13.410 --> 00:20:15.150
giving the Alga and advantage.

317
00:20:15.390 --> 00:20:20.390
And when they start overgrowing they release dissolved sugars into the water,

318
00:20:20.460 --> 00:20:25.460
essentially junk food and that nourishes microbes are live on the corals

319
00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:30.510
allowing species that are more likely to cause disease to bloom in large
numbers.

320
00:20:30.930 --> 00:20:34.770
So the algae effective return,
the corals microbiome against them.

321
00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:38.760
And this is a very different view of disease than we're used to.

322
00:20:38.850 --> 00:20:41.190
It's not something like tuberculosis,

323
00:20:41.191 --> 00:20:45.590
which has caused by one bacterium or play,
which is caused by one bacterium.

324
00:20:45.990 --> 00:20:50.830
This is a case where entire community of microbes has shifted from a normal

325
00:20:50.831 --> 00:20:55.000
healthy state into one that is likely to cause disease and there's a term for

326
00:20:55.001 --> 00:20:56.920
that.
It's called dysbiosis.

327
00:20:57.160 --> 00:21:02.160
It's an imbalance in the microbial communities that live within us as term is

328
00:21:02.711 --> 00:21:07.711
relevant to human health too because a ridiculous list of the human disorders

329
00:21:08.681 --> 00:21:13.630
and diseases have been linked to changes in the microbiome a list so long that

330
00:21:13.631 --> 00:21:15.460
it invites parody.

331
00:21:16.870 --> 00:21:21.640
Now for most of these conditions it is still unclear if changes in the

332
00:21:21.641 --> 00:21:25.300
microbiome lead to disease.
If it is the other way round,

333
00:21:25.301 --> 00:21:26.920
if it is a consequence of that,

334
00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:32.440
if it is both or neither and yet those links remain and so there are experiments

335
00:21:33.911 --> 00:21:38.530
which suggests that there is a sort of causal effect and those have all those

336
00:21:38.531 --> 00:21:41.110
involve the germ free mice that I showed you before.

337
00:21:41.550 --> 00:21:45.490
There have been many studies where you take a rodent that has some problems,

338
00:21:45.491 --> 00:21:49.840
say a obesity,
diabetes,
heart disease,
colorectal cancer,

339
00:21:50.110 --> 00:21:54.400
you take their gut microbiomes and you put them into one of these animals and

340
00:21:54.401 --> 00:21:58.240
often some of those symptoms of those conditions move across as well.

341
00:21:58.570 --> 00:22:02.350
So if you load that mouse with the microbiome from an obese mouse,

342
00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:03.970
it will start to put on weight.

343
00:22:05.070 --> 00:22:10.000
Now would that suggests that the microbes are to an extent,

344
00:22:10.030 --> 00:22:12.760
grabbing the wheel rather than just going along for the ride.

345
00:22:13.540 --> 00:22:16.330
What that means for human health,

346
00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:20.950
the extent to which microbes influence all these conditions that affect us and

347
00:22:20.951 --> 00:22:25.240
many of which have become more common in the last half century that is still

348
00:22:25.241 --> 00:22:26.380
being worked out.

349
00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:31.240
Scientists are also trying to look at what's changing our microbiome,

350
00:22:31.241 --> 00:22:35.560
what affects the communities that live within us and how that might affect our

351
00:22:35.561 --> 00:22:40.090
health.
And there are many possible things that do that.

352
00:22:40.091 --> 00:22:45.091
So humans have moved away from muddy countrysides and soil in contact with

353
00:22:45.551 --> 00:22:49.750
animals and lived.
We live in these urban jungles and are more style.

354
00:22:50.230 --> 00:22:55.230
We have waged a very successful war against the microbial world and have taken

355
00:22:55.481 --> 00:23:00.100
the sound principles of hygiene perhaps to an excerpt degree where we sterilize

356
00:23:00.130 --> 00:23:05.130
absolutely everything and have antibacterial or at all sorts of antibacterial

357
00:23:05.741 --> 00:23:08.800
goods.
We use antibiotics.

358
00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:13.000
These drugs have done a tremendous amount of good for us.

359
00:23:13.001 --> 00:23:16.090
They have saved countless lives for infectious diseases,

360
00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:19.000
but they are also unsubtle weapons.

361
00:23:19.150 --> 00:23:23.530
They kill the bacteria that we depend upon as well as the ones that causes harm.

362
00:23:23.830 --> 00:23:27.430
And we use them to an absurd degree,
not just when we need them,

363
00:23:27.580 --> 00:23:28.630
but when we don't.

364
00:23:28.660 --> 00:23:32.470
And for conditions like viral diseases for which antibiotics are completely ill

365
00:23:32.471 --> 00:23:37.290
suited to.
And finally our food has changed.
We are eat,

366
00:23:37.300 --> 00:23:41.650
we're eating much less plant foods,
much lower amounts of fiber.

367
00:23:42.040 --> 00:23:46.190
Fiber is important because it nourishes are wide range of microbes within us.

368
00:23:46.430 --> 00:23:51.350
Fiber consists of a large number of complex carbohydrates and no single species

369
00:23:51.351 --> 00:23:55.730
of microbes has the cutlery set.
It needs to eat all of them.
So you eat fiber,

370
00:23:55.731 --> 00:23:59.990
you nourish a very diverse community.
Okay,

371
00:24:00.110 --> 00:24:04.190
so what can we do about any of this?
If anything,

372
00:24:04.191 --> 00:24:08.540
if we are disconnecting ourselves from the microbial world and if those changes

373
00:24:08.541 --> 00:24:12.350
are,
as some scientists suggest leading to disease,

374
00:24:12.351 --> 00:24:16.430
what can we do about that?
Well,
theoretically a lot,

375
00:24:16.550 --> 00:24:20.060
as I've shown you,
microbiomes can change in positive ways very quickly.

376
00:24:20.690 --> 00:24:22.730
They can also change in negative ways very quickly,

377
00:24:22.731 --> 00:24:26.720
which means that they should be able to change in deliberate ways that we
choose.

378
00:24:27.110 --> 00:24:28.490
Unlike say our genomes,

379
00:24:28.491 --> 00:24:32.210
which are the same throughout our entire lives and which required very complex

380
00:24:32.211 --> 00:24:36.980
techniques in order to manipulate the microbiome is supposedly more flexible,

381
00:24:37.010 --> 00:24:40.700
more mutable,
at least it is in theory,

382
00:24:40.730 --> 00:24:44.480
in practice changing the world inside us is very complex.

383
00:24:44.750 --> 00:24:49.060
To take something like probiotics.
These are products like yogurt sachets,

384
00:24:49.070 --> 00:24:53.060
capsules,
what have you,
that supposedly contained beneficial microbes,

385
00:24:53.810 --> 00:24:58.580
but even though they are very good for certain things like infectious diarrhea,

386
00:24:58.610 --> 00:25:02.990
they are also medically underwhelming for a lot of other things.

387
00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:06.890
They have a lot of health claims that have been linked to them and by the large

388
00:25:06.950 --> 00:25:08.140
they don't meet up.

389
00:25:08.180 --> 00:25:12.920
They don't meet the expectations that have been latched onto them and that's

390
00:25:12.921 --> 00:25:17.750
probably because they consist of strains and species that have been chosen for

391
00:25:17.751 --> 00:25:22.160
historical reasons because they're easy to manufacture and grow and package not

392
00:25:22.161 --> 00:25:25.940
because they are the a listers of the gut that are good at colonizing our
bodies.

393
00:25:26.390 --> 00:25:29.030
Those species of them present in very small amounts.

394
00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:31.250
They are sometimes heavily industrialized,

395
00:25:31.251 --> 00:25:35.210
so they've been grown in industrialized cultures where a long period of time and

396
00:25:35.211 --> 00:25:38.270
are essentially domesticated microbes.

397
00:25:38.870 --> 00:25:41.030
So you swallow these products,
they go in,

398
00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:43.400
they don't do very much and they leave again.

399
00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:45.950
They certainly don't establish themselves in your body.

400
00:25:46.010 --> 00:25:50.510
I compare them to a breeze that blows between two open windows and that maybe

401
00:25:50.540 --> 00:25:52.430
rattle some objects along the way,

402
00:25:52.580 --> 00:25:57.580
but that doesn't have any lasting impact perhaps then it makes more sense to

403
00:25:58.670 --> 00:26:03.550
give people large communities of microbes that are well suited to life in the

404
00:26:03.551 --> 00:26:04.384
gut.

405
00:26:05.030 --> 00:26:09.140
And that is certainly the principle behind a very unorthodox and a little

406
00:26:09.141 --> 00:26:12.980
disturbing.
Uh,
her treatment call to the fecal transplant,

407
00:26:13.610 --> 00:26:16.030
which is exactly what it sounds like.
Um,

408
00:26:16.100 --> 00:26:20.090
it is very difficult to find an acceptable photo of a fecal transplant.

409
00:26:20.091 --> 00:26:24.320
So I've prepared this very technical slide to show you how it works.

410
00:26:24.890 --> 00:26:29.890
So you have a sick person and you give them store from a healthy person and then

411
00:26:30.471 --> 00:26:35.390
they're better.
It's a bit like an ecosystem transplant.

412
00:26:35.391 --> 00:26:37.900
I compare it to say Rita thing alone,

413
00:26:37.910 --> 00:26:42.140
that's been overrun with dandelions creating this bloke lovely green fresh

414
00:26:42.141 --> 00:26:43.290
pasture.
Um,

415
00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:48.920
and it works at least for one specific condition called clostridium difficile,

416
00:26:50.130 --> 00:26:55.130
a very weedy and invasive bacterium that can cause severe and intractable and

417
00:26:55.411 --> 00:26:59.010
often fatal or cases of diarrhea.
Um,

418
00:26:59.670 --> 00:27:04.280
see def,
uh,
there's been a trial or fecal transplantation force,

419
00:27:04.290 --> 00:27:07.080
clostridium difficile,
uh,
in that trial,

420
00:27:07.110 --> 00:27:09.910
people with the condition who were given standard antibiotics,

421
00:27:09.911 --> 00:27:12.900
some 27% of them were cured,

422
00:27:13.170 --> 00:27:18.150
whereas fecal transplants cured 94% of the people who took them.

423
00:27:18.990 --> 00:27:20.670
And time and again,
in many studies,

424
00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:25.080
this really weird and very gross procedure has worked wonders for this

425
00:27:25.081 --> 00:27:26.700
particular thing.
Now,

426
00:27:26.701 --> 00:27:30.030
it has therefore been tried on a lot of other conditions that the microbiome has

427
00:27:30.031 --> 00:27:33.300
been implicated in inflammatory bowel disease or irritable bowel syndrome,

428
00:27:33.301 --> 00:27:34.134
that sort of thing.

429
00:27:34.350 --> 00:27:39.300
And they're the re the results are more inconsistent and less,
uh,

430
00:27:39.450 --> 00:27:40.500
a bit less promising.

431
00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:44.760
And that's probably because c diff is a very unusual situation.

432
00:27:44.760 --> 00:27:47.840
It really is a bit like a monoculture of weeds.
Um,

433
00:27:47.910 --> 00:27:51.750
it may be a ecosystem that is easier to reset,

434
00:27:51.990 --> 00:27:55.350
whereas something like the gut of someone with inflammatory bowel disease may be

435
00:27:55.351 --> 00:27:58.830
much more complicated.
And the truth is we just don't know.

436
00:27:58.860 --> 00:28:03.030
We still don't really fully understand why these transplants work.

437
00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:05.970
Uh,
and that's big,

438
00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:08.910
that's abundantly clear when scientists tried to duplicate them.

439
00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:12.180
So several companies have tried to create,
um,

440
00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:17.040
essentially fecal trends of fake fecal transplant capsules that contain the

441
00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:21.540
bacteria that are meant to path that the meant to be beneficial,

442
00:28:21.750 --> 00:28:25.680
but without the it factor of actual feces.
Uh,

443
00:28:25.681 --> 00:28:29.070
and the most promising one of these pills,
uh,

444
00:28:29.071 --> 00:28:33.300
went into phase two clinical trials recently and performed really badly.

445
00:28:33.301 --> 00:28:35.490
They flunked out.
Uh,
which is a big shame,

446
00:28:35.491 --> 00:28:39.270
but it did allow me to write probably my best headline of the last year.

447
00:28:42.060 --> 00:28:47.060
I think all of this goes to show that it is very hard to change the ecosystems

448
00:28:47.401 --> 00:28:51.150
that live within us.
It is not a simple case of say,

449
00:28:51.330 --> 00:28:54.500
finding someone with a vitamin deficiency,
giving them some support,

450
00:28:54.501 --> 00:28:57.990
some supplements,
or like an orange and have them be better.

451
00:28:58.440 --> 00:29:00.450
These are complex worlds.

452
00:29:00.470 --> 00:29:04.140
They are the equivalent of jungles are coral reefs or grasslands.

453
00:29:04.500 --> 00:29:08.820
And changing them is as hard as it sounds.
Um,

454
00:29:08.830 --> 00:29:13.710
and we are still at the very early stages of understanding the microbiome and

455
00:29:13.711 --> 00:29:17.040
how it affects our health.
We still don't know,
for example,

456
00:29:17.160 --> 00:29:20.640
the full list of bacteria and other microbes that live within us.

457
00:29:20.940 --> 00:29:25.620
We don't understand why the microbiome change varies from person to person.

458
00:29:25.860 --> 00:29:30.450
It's certainly does,
all of our microbiomes are different to each other.
But,

459
00:29:30.830 --> 00:29:33.630
um,
if you take into account dire to medicines,

460
00:29:33.660 --> 00:29:36.660
all the various things that scientists think affect this world,

461
00:29:37.410 --> 00:29:41.500
we can only explain maybe about 10% of the variation across the population.

462
00:29:41.620 --> 00:29:46.510
The rest is a mystery.
This,
uh,
this world is also a very dynamic one.

463
00:29:46.540 --> 00:29:50.740
It changes with our,
with every one of our meals with um,
the,

464
00:29:50.741 --> 00:29:54.040
the rise and fall of the sun,
uh,
with our,

465
00:29:54.370 --> 00:29:58.300
with the diseases and the illnesses we get and the medicines we take to make

466
00:29:58.301 --> 00:30:03.190
ourselves better.
So we're still at this very early stage.
Um,

467
00:30:03.370 --> 00:30:08.110
and if we look at the wider world and backtrack a bit,

468
00:30:08.111 --> 00:30:09.400
so we are at this very early stage,

469
00:30:09.401 --> 00:30:13.390
but in terms of using the microbiome for medical purposes,

470
00:30:13.391 --> 00:30:16.750
I think there are a couple of things that we might be able to win at more

471
00:30:16.751 --> 00:30:21.751
quickly than things then actually trying to change the consortium of species

472
00:30:21.851 --> 00:30:26.050
that live within us.
And one might be to use the microbiome to,

473
00:30:26.550 --> 00:30:30.220
um,
to target our drugs and our medicines more effectively.

474
00:30:30.970 --> 00:30:35.970
So many types of medications from digoxin or heart drove to the latest

475
00:30:36.761 --> 00:30:41.761
blockbuster cancer therapies to everyday things like paracetamol work better in

476
00:30:42.101 --> 00:30:47.101
some people than in others depending on the microbes that they carry for various

477
00:30:47.381 --> 00:30:50.470
reasons.
In some cases the bacteria break down the drugs.

478
00:30:50.471 --> 00:30:54.400
In some cases they turn the drugs into some other chemicals that have toxic side

479
00:30:54.401 --> 00:30:55.234
effects.

480
00:30:55.450 --> 00:30:59.080
But we might be able to in the future to look at someone's microbiome and think,

481
00:30:59.260 --> 00:31:03.130
okay,
you should get this drug,
it will work in you.
You should not get this one.

482
00:31:03.131 --> 00:31:04.720
It's going to make you even worse.

483
00:31:05.950 --> 00:31:09.760
Another thing we might be able to do is actually drug the microbiome to actually

484
00:31:09.820 --> 00:31:13.390
change the way the bacteria inside his work without killing them,

485
00:31:13.420 --> 00:31:17.620
without resorting to antibiotics.
So here's one particular example,

486
00:31:18.070 --> 00:31:22.750
Coleen and carnitine and nutrients that are found in food that we eat and when

487
00:31:22.751 --> 00:31:27.340
we eat them,
they get transformed into this,
into TMA and Tmao.

488
00:31:28.690 --> 00:31:33.160
Tmao is bad news because it slows the breakdown of cholesterol and in our bodies

489
00:31:33.161 --> 00:31:37.510
and increases the deposit deposition of fat in our arteries leading to heart

490
00:31:37.511 --> 00:31:41.140
disease.
Okay,
what can we do about this?
Well,

491
00:31:41.560 --> 00:31:43.370
we could target a,

492
00:31:43.371 --> 00:31:47.140
an enzyme that we make ourselves that's encoded within our own genome,

493
00:31:47.141 --> 00:31:48.580
that code that,
uh,

494
00:31:49.180 --> 00:31:53.120
that is responsible for that conversion from Tma Tmao.

495
00:31:54.020 --> 00:31:58.030
Uh,
there are actually drugs that can do that and that can shut down that part of

496
00:31:58.031 --> 00:31:58.810
the pathway,

497
00:31:58.810 --> 00:32:03.810
which is great news except TMA smells of rotting fish so it's not really

498
00:32:03.971 --> 00:32:06.640
something you want building up in your body.

499
00:32:08.350 --> 00:32:09.820
So let's forget about that.

500
00:32:10.180 --> 00:32:15.180
That's we can try and target that bit the conversion from Coleen to TMA in the

501
00:32:15.251 --> 00:32:19.960
first place and that is done by bacterial enzymes rather than human ones.

502
00:32:20.440 --> 00:32:25.210
And there are drugs like one called DMV that can knock those enzymes out and

503
00:32:25.211 --> 00:32:26.560
therefore shut that pathway down.

504
00:32:27.640 --> 00:32:31.330
Now you'll probably have heard of statens statens are drugs that are given to

505
00:32:31.331 --> 00:32:32.910
people who have high cholesterol.

506
00:32:32.911 --> 00:32:37.090
We have a high risk of heart disease and statens work by targeting the human bit

507
00:32:37.091 --> 00:32:37.924
of us.

508
00:32:38.050 --> 00:32:42.790
Maybe in the future you go to a doctor with a and you have high cholesterol,

509
00:32:42.820 --> 00:32:44.420
you have a high risk of heart disease.

510
00:32:44.570 --> 00:32:49.070
Your doctor prescribes you to drugs a Staten to control the human bit of you and

511
00:32:49.071 --> 00:32:51.980
something like Dmv to control the bacterial better view.

512
00:32:54.140 --> 00:32:57.560
Okay.
As I've tried to say,

513
00:32:58.100 --> 00:33:00.650
all of this is still in a very early stage.

514
00:33:01.410 --> 00:33:06.050
We are only beginning our exploration of the microbial world,

515
00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:09.770
even though it's been 350 years since leaving hope first saw those little

516
00:33:09.771 --> 00:33:14.630
organisms under his incredibly powerful lenses.
If we go into the wider world,

517
00:33:14.660 --> 00:33:19.430
our ignorance becomes clearer and there are apps even more daunting.

518
00:33:19.910 --> 00:33:21.620
This picture is a tree of life.

519
00:33:21.710 --> 00:33:24.950
This represents everything that exists.

520
00:33:25.240 --> 00:33:28.190
It is a master family tree of life on earth.
Now,

521
00:33:28.191 --> 00:33:31.730
if I zoom in to this bit here,

522
00:33:33.410 --> 00:33:35.150
that's you.
Uh,

523
00:33:35.180 --> 00:33:40.180
this tiny little twig on this glow green feather are all the animals and plants

524
00:33:40.821 --> 00:33:43.370
are all the humans.
All the things that you are familiar with.

525
00:33:43.371 --> 00:33:46.220
The rest of this tree is microbial.

526
00:33:47.450 --> 00:33:52.340
And if you look at the red dots that are everywhere,

527
00:33:53.030 --> 00:33:58.030
those represent groups that have never been seen and never been isolated.

528
00:33:58.370 --> 00:34:02.990
We only know that they exist because someone has sequenced their DNA from some

529
00:34:02.991 --> 00:34:07.340
bits of the world around us,
from soil,
from water,
from our own bodies.

530
00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:12.860
And that purple spray on the right that was discovered,

531
00:34:12.920 --> 00:34:16.580
I think a few months ago,
possibly know more than a year.

532
00:34:16.940 --> 00:34:20.480
That is a vast amount of bacterial diversity.

533
00:34:20.660 --> 00:34:24.500
Most of which was found in a single river in Colorado.

534
00:34:25.310 --> 00:34:30.310
So think about how much we still have yet to discover about the world around us

535
00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:33.770
as microbiologists.
Jonathan Eisen,
right?

536
00:34:34.100 --> 00:34:38.930
We basically know nothing about the total diversity of the tree of life.

537
00:34:40.460 --> 00:34:44.960
And I think that this diversity is worth exploring.
We can't see these things.

538
00:34:44.961 --> 00:34:48.890
We don't know what they are.
They seem insignificant to us.

539
00:34:49.430 --> 00:34:54.430
And yet the exploration of the microbial world can lead to massive and

540
00:34:54.980 --> 00:34:56.570
unexpected benefits for us.

541
00:34:56.630 --> 00:34:59.810
And that is the theme of the final story that I am going to tell you.

542
00:35:01.010 --> 00:35:02.810
It involves this guy,

543
00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:08.200
a scientist called simion Burt wall back in 1924 he and a colleague named

544
00:35:08.271 --> 00:35:13.271
Marshall Hertig discovered a new type of bacterium inside the cells of an insect

545
00:35:14.300 --> 00:35:16.670
and they didn't know what it was.
They didn't know whether it was common,

546
00:35:16.671 --> 00:35:17.504
what it did.

547
00:35:17.970 --> 00:35:21.800
It took them 12 years for hurting to actually give the thing a name.

548
00:35:21.860 --> 00:35:26.750
And he named it after his friend and called it war back here or back here.

549
00:35:26.751 --> 00:35:30.920
Lives in the cells of insects and it lives in the cells of a lot of insects.

550
00:35:31.400 --> 00:35:33.590
A decade after these two found it,

551
00:35:33.650 --> 00:35:36.740
loads of scientists who were studying bacteria in intake probably suddenly

552
00:35:36.741 --> 00:35:39.480
realized that they were all studying the same thing,
which was this thing.

553
00:35:40.110 --> 00:35:44.640
This is found in something like 40% of species of insects and other arthropods,

554
00:35:44.641 --> 00:35:49.140
and given that those are already the most diverse and rich and abundant

555
00:35:49.380 --> 00:35:50.670
organisms on the planet,

556
00:35:50.970 --> 00:35:54.780
this is almost certainly one of the most successful bacteria in the world.

557
00:35:55.770 --> 00:35:58.560
And what it does varies from host host.

558
00:35:58.830 --> 00:36:02.070
Well back here is a bit of a misaddressed.

559
00:36:02.100 --> 00:36:07.100
It doesn't like males because it only passes down the female line from mother to

560
00:36:07.651 --> 00:36:09.660
daughter.
Sons are a dead end to it,

561
00:36:10.170 --> 00:36:13.830
and it deals with that in many different ways.
In this animal,

562
00:36:13.831 --> 00:36:15.240
the Blue Moon Butterfly,

563
00:36:15.570 --> 00:36:20.570
it just kills male embryos outright so that some populations have a hundred

564
00:36:21.331 --> 00:36:24.240
females to every one male,
uh,

565
00:36:24.270 --> 00:36:29.270
in some wood lice wall back here transforms males into females in some wasps.

566
00:36:29.910 --> 00:36:34.380
It allows the females to reproduce by cloning themselves asexually so that they

567
00:36:34.381 --> 00:36:38.160
have no need for males at all in other insects.

568
00:36:38.161 --> 00:36:41.700
Well back here is some people are smiling on their own.
Why can we get this?

569
00:36:42.040 --> 00:36:44.050
I'm sorry we're back.
It doesn't.

570
00:36:44.070 --> 00:36:49.070
In fact people there are in some cases it is an ally is beneficial in this

571
00:36:52.381 --> 00:36:53.850
animal.
Them bedbug.

572
00:36:54.150 --> 00:36:58.380
It provides B vitamins that are missing from the animal's blood meals.

573
00:36:59.250 --> 00:37:02.970
This leaf has a little green bit and the corner.

574
00:37:03.030 --> 00:37:08.030
This is the work of a caterpillar that uses wall back here to stop the leaf from

575
00:37:08.521 --> 00:37:09.390
turning yellow,

576
00:37:09.660 --> 00:37:13.410
creating this little green island in which the insect can continue to feed.

577
00:37:14.460 --> 00:37:18.090
But the thing will back here does that is most interesting to us in vols and

578
00:37:18.091 --> 00:37:21.210
insect that doesn't naturally curry it nuts.

579
00:37:21.211 --> 00:37:24.630
This the tiger mosquito eighties a tie,

580
00:37:24.660 --> 00:37:28.710
this thing spreads yellow fever,
dengue fever,
Zika,
Chikungunya,

581
00:37:28.950 --> 00:37:31.740
all kinds of nasty tropical diseases.

582
00:37:32.280 --> 00:37:36.900
And for 25 years Australian scientists have been trying to put wall back here.

583
00:37:37.220 --> 00:37:38.490
Insiders,
mosquito.

584
00:37:38.550 --> 00:37:42.600
And they finally succeeded a while back and they've spent so much time doing

585
00:37:42.601 --> 00:37:45.870
this because when the tiger mosquito carries wall back here,

586
00:37:46.110 --> 00:37:50.490
it cannot spread the viruses that cause all those diseases I talked about.

587
00:37:50.790 --> 00:37:55.440
It transforms from a vector into a dead end for human disease.

588
00:37:56.910 --> 00:38:00.150
The other thing that's great about this is that wall back here is amazing.

589
00:38:00.151 --> 00:38:05.040
It's spreading through populations because it changes the reproductive biology

590
00:38:05.041 --> 00:38:05.874
of its host.

591
00:38:05.970 --> 00:38:10.970
If you release infected mosquitoes into the wild within a few generations,

592
00:38:12.060 --> 00:38:17.010
all the insects and the local area should carry this muskie to this bacterium

593
00:38:17.130 --> 00:38:20.640
and thus be unable to spread the diseases that cause us harm.

594
00:38:21.390 --> 00:38:23.670
And this approach has been tried in a few places.

595
00:38:23.700 --> 00:38:28.440
This is an experiment in 2011 that in a suburb in Australia that went from

596
00:38:28.441 --> 00:38:30.210
January to May,

597
00:38:30.570 --> 00:38:35.040
these gray bars represent the release of war Bacchae infected mosquitoes in that

598
00:38:35.050 --> 00:38:35.710
suburb.

599
00:38:35.710 --> 00:38:39.640
And the Green Line shows the proportion of the wild insects that carry the

600
00:38:39.641 --> 00:38:44.641
bacterium that went from zero to a hundred by this point,

601
00:38:46.180 --> 00:38:50.480
all the insects buzzing over that suburb can't spread.
Things like danglies,

602
00:38:50.481 --> 00:38:51.460
Eaker and the like.

603
00:38:52.580 --> 00:38:56.200
And this approach is now being tested in larger parts of the world in places

604
00:38:56.201 --> 00:38:58.030
like Brazil,
Colombia,
Indonesia,

605
00:38:58.031 --> 00:39:02.650
and Vietnam in mega cities that have huge problems with these diseases.

606
00:39:03.550 --> 00:39:07.130
It's got many advantages to it.
Uh,

607
00:39:07.210 --> 00:39:12.130
unlike insecticides,
which need to be re sprayed constantly and which are toxic.

608
00:39:12.160 --> 00:39:16.000
Well back here is not all back here,
doesn't infect humans.

609
00:39:16.001 --> 00:39:18.880
It doesn't infect other animals that might eat mosquitoes.

610
00:39:19.270 --> 00:39:23.320
It doesn't kill the insects.
So it doesn't have any ecological consequences.

611
00:39:23.321 --> 00:39:25.530
We're not going to look at,
uh,
at,
uh,

612
00:39:25.660 --> 00:39:28.300
domino effects from a world without mosquitoes.

613
00:39:28.900 --> 00:39:32.860
And it doesn't involve any Jersey multiplication.
Uh,

614
00:39:32.890 --> 00:39:36.460
so for people who have a problem with that and might be,
uh,

615
00:39:36.670 --> 00:39:40.750
might be against using this approach,
well back here is fine.
It doesn't,

616
00:39:40.780 --> 00:39:42.850
it doesn't count.
Now,

617
00:39:44.080 --> 00:39:47.680
could marshal and heartache have predicted any of this?

618
00:39:47.680 --> 00:39:51.760
Could they have seen in 1924 when they're discovered this thing that it might be

619
00:39:51.761 --> 00:39:55.100
a solution to some of these diseases that infect,

620
00:39:55.180 --> 00:39:59.770
that affect millions of people?
I highly doubt it.
In fact,

621
00:39:59.920 --> 00:40:04.920
walback died in 19 in the 1950s way before anyone realized how common wall back

622
00:40:05.891 --> 00:40:07.840
his way before he,
he,

623
00:40:07.841 --> 00:40:11.920
before anyone realized that his name had been grafted onto one of the greatest

624
00:40:11.921 --> 00:40:16.780
pandemics in the history of life and the solution to many of our health

625
00:40:16.781 --> 00:40:17.710
problems.

626
00:40:18.340 --> 00:40:23.340
And I think the story of Wall back here is the story of animal associated

627
00:40:23.561 --> 00:40:28.030
microbes in a nutshell.
For the longest time we ignore these things,

628
00:40:28.031 --> 00:40:30.130
we neglected them and then we fed them.

629
00:40:30.520 --> 00:40:35.520
And now I think it is time to appreciate them because they are crucial parts of

630
00:40:35.891 --> 00:40:38.620
the world around us.
They might be important for us,

631
00:40:38.770 --> 00:40:40.990
not just for changing the way we live,

632
00:40:41.140 --> 00:40:44.590
but the way we think about ourselves and our place in the world.

633
00:40:44.950 --> 00:40:48.640
And I think all of that begins with basic curiosity.
It was that,

634
00:40:48.641 --> 00:40:51.120
that drove those two people to look at that,
uh,

635
00:40:51.230 --> 00:40:53.980
to find wall back here in the first place.
It was that that drove low,

636
00:40:53.981 --> 00:40:58.270
even hope to look at water and see the microbial world for the first time.

637
00:40:58.750 --> 00:41:00.790
And it's that sense of curiosity and wonder though.

638
00:41:00.791 --> 00:41:04.540
I would like to instill in people through the book.
Thank you very much.

639
00:41:04.850 --> 00:41:05.683
<v 3>Sure.</v>

640
00:41:11.170 --> 00:41:14.380
<v 0>Thank you very much.
I think we have to run five minutes for questions.</v>

641
00:41:20.610 --> 00:41:21.443
<v 3>Great.</v>

642
00:41:22.230 --> 00:41:26.730
<v 0>So I think a lot of media about gene therapy and oh,</v>

643
00:41:26.731 --> 00:41:29.850
we found a new gene that does this and what x and y and so forth.

644
00:41:30.060 --> 00:41:34.520
Do you think the,
a lot of research has been placed into genes and DNA

645
00:41:34.550 --> 00:41:35.061
<v 4>and so forth,</v>

646
00:41:35.061 --> 00:41:39.290
where as perhaps it should have been placed into a study of bacteria and micro

647
00:41:39.590 --> 00:41:39.900
bio?

648
00:41:39.900 --> 00:41:43.160
<v 0>Well,
I wouldn't like to,
I don't feel it's a zero sum game.</v>

649
00:41:43.220 --> 00:41:45.380
I mean it kind of is because there's funding is limited,

650
00:41:45.410 --> 00:41:49.850
but like we need to understand all of these aspects of ourselves.
I think,
um,

651
00:41:50.330 --> 00:41:53.870
uh,
understanding the human genome,
um,
and,

652
00:41:53.900 --> 00:41:56.950
and using it to improve our health.
Um,
I think we'll,

653
00:41:56.951 --> 00:41:59.630
we'll pay off in the long run.
Um,
but the,

654
00:41:59.631 --> 00:42:03.740
the microbiome has been an underappreciated side of our biology and I think it's

655
00:42:03.741 --> 00:42:07.910
getting it's share of the limelight now.
I think the comparison is that because,

656
00:42:07.911 --> 00:42:12.800
um,
when the human genome came out about 12 years ago,
it wasn't now,

657
00:42:13.100 --> 00:42:17.120
um,
they were grandiose claims made about it,
understanding,
um,

658
00:42:17.360 --> 00:42:21.800
all of our DNA would give us solutions to all of these problems like

659
00:42:21.801 --> 00:42:25.190
schizophrenia,
cancer or all of these things.
Um,

660
00:42:25.250 --> 00:42:30.250
and that's been slow to turn up because biology is always more complicated than

661
00:42:31.251 --> 00:42:34.940
we think it is.
And then 10 years on there was backlash.
People were saying,
Oh,

662
00:42:34.941 --> 00:42:38.030
where is all the stuff that came out of the human genome that you promised?

663
00:42:38.450 --> 00:42:41.750
I think the microbiome is going through exactly the same kind of hype cycle.
Now.

664
00:42:41.840 --> 00:42:42.560
You know,
we,
I've,

665
00:42:42.560 --> 00:42:45.770
I've been to conferences where people talk about the microbes within us as if

666
00:42:45.771 --> 00:42:48.560
they were going to be this panacea for all of our health problems.

667
00:42:48.980 --> 00:42:52.100
And I think they might explain a lot of things,

668
00:42:52.101 --> 00:42:57.101
but we're still so far away from turning into an application into a practical or

669
00:42:58.071 --> 00:43:02.570
even a predictive science.
I can't look at your microbiome now and tell you like,

670
00:43:02.810 --> 00:43:06.590
what,
like what you have,
what you're at risk of.
Um,
we're just,

671
00:43:06.591 --> 00:43:07.700
we're just not that stage yet.

672
00:43:08.540 --> 00:43:09.373
<v 3>Cool.</v>

673
00:43:11.930 --> 00:43:15.480
<v 4>Hey,
um,
I have a bit of a tangential question.
Okay.
Uh,</v>

674
00:43:15.520 --> 00:43:20.360
so you mentioned the gut microbes in Japan doing the DNA swab thing.

675
00:43:21.350 --> 00:43:24.500
How does that actually get inherited to children?

676
00:43:24.501 --> 00:43:27.440
Is it through breastfeeding or similar or,
yeah,
it's a good question.

677
00:43:27.470 --> 00:43:29.060
<v 0>So we,
um,</v>

678
00:43:29.090 --> 00:43:33.650
we do pass on some of our microbes to our kids,

679
00:43:34.020 --> 00:43:38.930
um,
and that's probably just through social contact.

680
00:43:39.350 --> 00:43:40.183
Um,

681
00:43:41.030 --> 00:43:46.030
anyone who has ever watched a birth one know that it's a messy process and bits

682
00:43:47.691 --> 00:43:52.400
from all sorts of organ systems end up in all sorts of places.
So yeah,

683
00:43:52.401 --> 00:43:55.200
you do get,
you do get stuff passed along.
Um,

684
00:43:55.201 --> 00:43:59.150
and that probably explains why it transfers that happen in one individual could

685
00:43:59.151 --> 00:44:01.280
then cascade down the generations.

686
00:44:02.330 --> 00:44:02.810
<v 3>Okay,</v>

687
00:44:02.810 --> 00:44:07.370
<v 0>thanks.
You said that,
um,
there's no,
uh,
evidence that</v>

688
00:44:08.870 --> 00:44:12.950
microbes are involved in the,
in human development.
I mean,

689
00:44:12.951 --> 00:44:17.090
the classic story was that the sort of inside the placenta was sterile.
Is,

690
00:44:17.330 --> 00:44:21.620
is there now much evidence to show that the are actually microbes inside?
Right.

691
00:44:21.870 --> 00:44:25.950
That's a good question.
I more meant after babies are born.

692
00:44:25.951 --> 00:44:29.790
So as we grow up,
um,
they help to shape the development of,
you know,

693
00:44:29.850 --> 00:44:34.330
various organs,
uh,
even in a continual way.
They help too.
They effect influence,

694
00:44:34.331 --> 00:44:36.870
say the regeneration of the cells that line the gut.

695
00:44:36.930 --> 00:44:41.010
So it's more of a continuous process that starts off to birth,

696
00:44:41.040 --> 00:44:43.350
at least for for us.
Um,

697
00:44:43.410 --> 00:44:48.410
it certainly used to be thought of and still largely is thought that the womb is

698
00:44:49.141 --> 00:44:50.220
a sterile environment.

699
00:44:50.490 --> 00:44:55.490
There have been a few studies suggesting that I've claimed to have found signs

700
00:44:55.771 --> 00:44:59.940
of bacterial DNA in the womb and then these other tissues like the amniotic sac

701
00:44:59.941 --> 00:45:04.290
and the umbilical cord.
I'm doubtful of that.
Um,
I'm,

702
00:45:04.350 --> 00:45:06.660
I'm very,
very skeptical about it and it,

703
00:45:06.900 --> 00:45:09.600
I've asked a lot of scientists who work in this field and there are also very

704
00:45:09.601 --> 00:45:14.460
skeptical,
but um,
so the,
the sterile womb paradigms still holds.

705
00:45:14.461 --> 00:45:17.190
I think it's,
it might be overturned the future,
but it's not yet.

706
00:45:19.660 --> 00:45:20.720
Any more questions?

707
00:45:22.740 --> 00:45:23.573
<v 3>Yup.</v>

708
00:45:25.040 --> 00:45:27.380
<v 0>What do you use instead of shampoo?</v>

709
00:45:29.490 --> 00:45:33.620
I use shampoo.
I,
um,
I feel that the,

710
00:45:34.160 --> 00:45:34.993
the thing,

711
00:45:35.570 --> 00:45:36.070
<v 3>okay,</v>

712
00:45:36.070 --> 00:45:38.890
<v 0>the way to think about hygiene is just in terms of common sense.
You know,</v>

713
00:45:38.891 --> 00:45:43.420
I don't think any of us want to go back to a time when people were sanitation

714
00:45:43.421 --> 00:45:44.820
wasn't a thing.
And we were,
you know,

715
00:45:45.160 --> 00:45:48.400
having a drinking like sewage contaminated water.
Uh,

716
00:45:48.430 --> 00:45:52.450
I certainly think that my friends and family would be much happier if I actually

717
00:45:52.451 --> 00:45:56.890
showered a lot.
Um,
but I think we go too far with it,
you know,
so I,

718
00:45:56.950 --> 00:45:57.700
um,

719
00:45:57.700 --> 00:46:02.460
I'm not one to say use like hand sanitizers all the time and um,

720
00:46:02.980 --> 00:46:06.160
uh,
and I think that we,

721
00:46:06.760 --> 00:46:11.560
we take the concert to hygiene,
we take the concert to cleanliness like,
uh,
to,

722
00:46:11.620 --> 00:46:14.650
to an absurd degree.
And I think there's kind of balance.

723
00:46:14.651 --> 00:46:18.690
There is moderation to be happy.
One more question.

724
00:46:22.380 --> 00:46:23.213
<v 3>Thank you Brian.</v>

725
00:46:25.930 --> 00:46:29.110
<v 0>So I am the conversation around over use of antibiotics.</v>

726
00:46:29.111 --> 00:46:31.650
Do you address that in the book?
Can,
do you think that conversation is him?

727
00:46:31.651 --> 00:46:34.740
You said,
be gathering some momentum at the moment?
Uh,

728
00:46:34.790 --> 00:46:39.490
although I recently read that they'd found a new strain and I'll knows,
Oh,

729
00:46:39.550 --> 00:46:42.880
H I'm not sure how it got picked up by the popular press or I mean,

730
00:46:43.300 --> 00:46:45.760
are we screwed?
Is,
are we aware of using antibiotics,

731
00:46:45.761 --> 00:46:49.150
but is it competition moving in the right way to reduce that use?
Yeah,

732
00:46:49.151 --> 00:46:53.530
I feel that it is.
Um,
maybe,
uh,
so,
okay.

733
00:46:53.590 --> 00:46:57.630
So we are running out of antibiotics.
We have,
um,

734
00:46:57.940 --> 00:47:02.730
we have discovered no new classes in several decades and the bacteria are

735
00:47:02.731 --> 00:47:06.730
becoming increasingly resistant to the ones that we do have.
So yeah,

736
00:47:06.731 --> 00:47:11.470
we're kind of screwed.
Um,
and we're,
we're in a,
we're in really bad shape with it.

737
00:47:11.540 --> 00:47:14.650
Uh,
I'm not going to lie.
It is kind of terrifying.
Um,

738
00:47:16.120 --> 00:47:21.120
in in many ways reducing the use of antibiotics has two wins attached to it.

739
00:47:23.050 --> 00:47:25.460
It reduces the,
uh,

740
00:47:25.490 --> 00:47:30.130
it's slows down the evolution of a drug microbes,

741
00:47:30.630 --> 00:47:31.720
the ones that causes harm.

742
00:47:31.780 --> 00:47:36.430
And it also spares the ones that live in our bodies and do good for us.

743
00:47:36.431 --> 00:47:39.130
So it,
it's a win win thing and we should,

744
00:47:39.520 --> 00:47:42.070
we should be more judicious about our use of antibiotics.

745
00:47:42.071 --> 00:47:45.850
People get so many courses of treatment that they have that they really do not

746
00:47:45.851 --> 00:47:49.930
need.
Um,
and even if you go beyond the human world,
um,

747
00:47:50.140 --> 00:47:52.480
antibiotics in agriculture is,
uh,
is,
uh,

748
00:47:52.570 --> 00:47:57.570
used incredibly heavily and that should be cut back on to a are we,

749
00:48:00.551 --> 00:48:05.440
it is there hope?
Well,
sort of.
Um,
there,

750
00:48:05.470 --> 00:48:10.000
there was that paper about a new antibiotic found in the nose.
Um,
we,
uh,

751
00:48:10.001 --> 00:48:11.980
I actually wrote about that at the Atlantic.

752
00:48:12.520 --> 00:48:15.910
The human microbiome seems like a really good potential source of new

753
00:48:15.911 --> 00:48:20.170
antibiotics.
The reason why they looked in the nose is that,
um,

754
00:48:20.950 --> 00:48:23.770
the mouth and the gut are places full of microbes,

755
00:48:23.830 --> 00:48:27.010
but they are also full of nutrients.
We eat stuff all the time.

756
00:48:27.011 --> 00:48:31.090
So we feed that the things that live there.
The nose has no resources.

757
00:48:31.091 --> 00:48:33.730
So unless you're eating in a really strange way,

758
00:48:34.300 --> 00:48:36.970
the bacteria in your nose have little to go on.

759
00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:39.280
And so they are incredibly competitive.

760
00:48:39.310 --> 00:48:42.510
They need to fight for everything that's there.
Um,

761
00:48:42.790 --> 00:48:47.790
and antibiotics are bacterial weapons or the things that we use to treat

762
00:48:47.830 --> 00:48:52.630
ourselves are derived from molecules that bacteria use to wage war on each

763
00:48:52.631 --> 00:48:57.160
other.
So if you're looking in places in the body where microbes will probably be

764
00:48:57.161 --> 00:48:59.230
experiencing the greatest amount of competition,

765
00:48:59.231 --> 00:49:02.890
we might be able to more easily find new drugs,

766
00:49:02.891 --> 00:49:06.520
or at least that was the reason behind looking in the nose.
Um,

767
00:49:06.580 --> 00:49:08.670
but these things take,
you know,

768
00:49:08.680 --> 00:49:12.670
to go from finding a new drug in a laboratory study to actually having a

769
00:49:12.671 --> 00:49:16.980
marketable antibiotic takes a lot of work and one of the problems at the moment

770
00:49:16.981 --> 00:49:20.960
does that.
And then there's basically no incentive for doing that.
Um,

771
00:49:21.040 --> 00:49:23.470
they're like,
if you're a pharmaceutical company,

772
00:49:23.710 --> 00:49:27.970
your business model is to find a new drug,
release it into the,
into the market,

773
00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:31.930
have it be a cohort or blockbuster dominates the market for a few years before

774
00:49:31.931 --> 00:49:34.690
your patent runs out.
So you make as much money as possible.

775
00:49:34.930 --> 00:49:38.770
Problem with antibiotics is that what everyone tells you to do with antibiotics

776
00:49:38.771 --> 00:49:41.680
is to hold back on them until you really need them.

777
00:49:41.950 --> 00:49:45.760
So a business model where you're producing a new drug and then people tell you

778
00:49:45.761 --> 00:49:50.350
not to use it for a very long time is a crap one,

779
00:49:50.410 --> 00:49:52.990
which is why there's been so much disinvestment here.

780
00:49:53.500 --> 00:49:58.500
So I think it's not just a case of finding new drugs or like slowing down our

781
00:49:58.661 --> 00:50:02.260
use of the current ones.
We also need to change the economics of it.

782
00:50:02.290 --> 00:50:05.760
And there have been suggestions of creating these like,
um,
uh,

783
00:50:06.010 --> 00:50:09.340
like entry reward schemes where you pay,

784
00:50:09.550 --> 00:50:13.270
you pay companies for the process of research and development,
um,

785
00:50:13.330 --> 00:50:17.470
and you do that through like public funds that will probably be need,

786
00:50:17.980 --> 00:50:22.040
probably need to be gathered through large international parts.
Thank you.

787
00:50:23.970 --> 00:50:26.440
Thank you very much.
We are running out of [inaudible] so thank you again.

788
00:50:27.690 --> 00:50:32.390
[inaudible].
