00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:07.920
Please put your hands together.
Welcome to the stage Peter Godfrey Smith.

2
00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:12.431
Okay.

3
00:00:12.431 --> 00:00:17.431
This talk will be a fast underwater to of animal evolution.

4
00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:20.740
Uh,
and in particular the evolution of the mind.

5
00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:26.170
The first fact here I think is the fact that the mind evolved in the sea.

6
00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:30.280
This idea has,
uh,
several sides to it.
Firstly,

7
00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:33.310
just the fact that for all the early stages,

8
00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.360
that first and crucial period until about 400 million years ago,

9
00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.550
just about all life and all animal life was in the sea.

10
00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:46.660
That was the context.
And in that period before life on land,

11
00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:51.280
most of the essentials were laid down.
So the evolution of animals themselves,

12
00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:54.490
the evolution of nervous systems and then brains,

13
00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:57.820
the evolution of complex sensors such as eyes.

14
00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:03.150
And if bodies that can act in complex ways and to some extent all the rest is

15
00:01:04.241 --> 00:01:06.550
fine tuning.
Now,

16
00:01:06.551 --> 00:01:11.350
I'm not saying that everything was in place before we came up on land.

17
00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.770
Mammals certainly have special features as to humans,

18
00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:16.810
but the basics are in place.

19
00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:22.000
And the question then arises is whether what was in place included those aspects

20
00:01:22.001 --> 00:01:25.780
of the mind that philosophers have found most mysterious,

21
00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:29.170
subjective experience and consciousness.

22
00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:31.690
Now this is a famously difficult question,

23
00:01:31.691 --> 00:01:34.360
but I think we can work towards answering it.

24
00:01:34.361 --> 00:01:37.120
And I think the answer to the question is yes.

25
00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:43.330
Now one more aspect to the idea that the mind evolved in the sea,
uh,

26
00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.040
is related to that last point.

27
00:01:45.041 --> 00:01:50.041
So when you think about how it's even possible for a physical system to have

28
00:01:50.411 --> 00:01:53.530
mental states,
especially experiences,

29
00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:56.320
part of what makes this problem seems so hard,

30
00:01:56.321 --> 00:02:00.700
I think so hard that people despair of it is the fact that people have a

31
00:02:00.701 --> 00:02:03.290
particular picture of the physical,
uh,

32
00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.370
in their heads when they think about this aspect of the problem.

33
00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.640
They have a kind of dry land macroscopic,

34
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.000
a picture of the physical and how physical things interact or perhaps they have

35
00:02:15.821 --> 00:02:19.690
in mind the particular kinds of interaction you find within present day

36
00:02:19.691 --> 00:02:23.020
computers with a processor or many processes,

37
00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:27.910
various kinds of memory and a cascade of read and write operations.
Now,

38
00:02:27.911 --> 00:02:31.630
I think this is part of what is steered people the wrong way,

39
00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:36.900
not so much the computational electronic picture of the material.

40
00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:41.800
And I think that's an interesting topic to think about here at Google,
but the,

41
00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:46.480
the more general picture of the physical and the earlier mechanistic conception,

42
00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:51.160
uh,
I think has been a significant source of trouble here.
Instead,

43
00:02:51.161 --> 00:02:54.730
we should think about the distinctive properties of cellular life,

44
00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:58.420
the particular kinds of going on goings on within cells.

45
00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:02.740
That's an aqueous environment and a Nano scale environment.

46
00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:04.630
Everything is in water,
in solution.

47
00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:09.790
This continual spontaneous activity and the way things get done within a shell

48
00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:14.770
is by means of essentially a multitude of biased random walks.

49
00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:19.420
So the physical itself is different in the sea and in cells.
Now,

50
00:03:19.421 --> 00:03:22.420
I'm not saying that's itself enough to remove or mystery,

51
00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:25.480
but I think it's important to think the right way,

52
00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:30.280
thinking the right way about the biological basis of the mind as we think about

53
00:03:30.281 --> 00:03:34.870
this problem.
And when animals moved up on land,

54
00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:38.830
this is an animal has not yet moved up on land.
They took all this with them.

55
00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:44.020
They hold up in this cells,
the chemistry of the sea,
where they came from.

56
00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:48.090
Now,
as the title of my book suggests,

57
00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:52.510
we are working towards the special role in this story of octopuses and other

58
00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:55.310
cephalopods,
but we're not there yet.
Uh,

59
00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:00.520
the next thing to think about is the overall shape of the history of animal

60
00:04:00.521 --> 00:04:05.200
life.
Now lies in general forms the shape of a tree,

61
00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:09.970
roughly speaking.
So from a single route,
a series of branching events,

62
00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:14.590
usually with no rejoining extend to the present day,

63
00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:16.930
there are branchings and then divergence.

64
00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:22.090
This process began with single celled life.
We don't know the original forms,

65
00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:25.360
but based on what we know about single celled organisms.

66
00:04:25.361 --> 00:04:29.920
Now the picture to have in your mind is not little cells that are self
contained,

67
00:04:29.921 --> 00:04:34.060
little islands,
but uh,
systems that are open to the world,

68
00:04:34.061 --> 00:04:37.090
sensing and responding,
uh,
exhibiting behavior,

69
00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:41.920
including even social behavior on a tiny scale.
Now,

70
00:04:41.921 --> 00:04:45.190
animals are one branch of multicellular life.

71
00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:50.670
And the first way to think about animals who say I one pretty big branch of the

72
00:04:51.461 --> 00:04:52.390
tree of life,

73
00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:57.570
a branch that comes off around 900 million years ago or so perhaps.

74
00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:02.110
And in that transition to multicellular life,

75
00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:06.580
the sensing and signaling that cells had been doing his whole organisms in the

76
00:05:06.581 --> 00:05:11.581
unicellular state is now used to coordinate activities of cells within the new

77
00:05:12.251 --> 00:05:17.251
collective entities that had arisen making possible coordinated and coherent

78
00:05:18.011 --> 00:05:18.844
action.

79
00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:23.880
So the social behavior of cells becomes the means for all animal action.

80
00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:30.970
Now there's no fossil record of the very earliest stages,

81
00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.500
the first stages of the history of animal life that we do have a fossil record

82
00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:38.770
of,
uh,
from the Edm ackeren period.
Uh,

83
00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:43.150
roughly 635 to 540 million years ago.

84
00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:46.060
This is a photo of a fossil,

85
00:05:46.061 --> 00:05:50.680
of a tip of a typical Ediacaran fossil in the South Australian museum.

86
00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:52.090
And the,

87
00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:56.110
it's the sort of round thing that is the likely animal fossil,

88
00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:59.720
something that looks a little bit like a bathmat.
Um,

89
00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:03.290
so life was very different back then.
Everything,

90
00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:08.120
all animals with soft bodied and life also seems to have been fairly quiet.

91
00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:12.920
This is a,
I think a gorgeous reconstruction of Ed ackeren life,
uh,

92
00:06:12.921 --> 00:06:15.140
by the English artists,
John Civic.

93
00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:18.920
And one of the distinctive things that this sort of illustration captures is the

94
00:06:18.921 --> 00:06:20.840
fact that animals,
uh,
well,

95
00:06:20.841 --> 00:06:23.840
it's not even clear which of these living things were animals,

96
00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:27.890
but animals in particular don't seem to have had too much to do with each other.

97
00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:32.300
Many of them probably didn't move around at all.
So that's the first stage.

98
00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:37.250
And now I want to start to place all this into a larger historical context.

99
00:06:37.251 --> 00:06:41.480
Also looking forward.
So there is a summary picture of part of the,

100
00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:46.160
uh,
animal branch of the tree of life.
This is from the book.

101
00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:48.350
So with all of these are tree pictures,

102
00:06:48.351 --> 00:06:52.990
you should think of time as running up the screen and the first,
uh,

103
00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:58.040
so we have a series of branchings giving rise to at the top various different

104
00:06:58.041 --> 00:06:59.810
present day kinds of organisms.

105
00:06:59.811 --> 00:07:03.560
Vertebrates there on the left mollusks including cephalopods,

106
00:07:03.561 --> 00:07:07.670
which I'll talk about shortly,
arthropods,
including insects.

107
00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:12.110
Then you get things like Jelly fish and sponges.
Um,

108
00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:13.310
and the first,

109
00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:16.940
well the next thing to note is that many of the deep branchings in animal

110
00:07:16.941 --> 00:07:21.110
evolution took place in the EDL ackeren period.

111
00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:25.850
That's when the sort of separations occurred.
Now here's another picture,

112
00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:29.300
not from the book,
uh,
from another paper of mine.

113
00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:33.350
What the orange band there represents is the fact that the deep historical

114
00:07:33.351 --> 00:07:36.140
branchings giving rise to various present day groups,

115
00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:41.380
those branchings took place in the EDL occurring at this time of very limited

116
00:07:41.601 --> 00:07:42.434
interaction.

117
00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:47.270
A particularly important animal living at that time might have looked something

118
00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:51.410
like this.
This is a sort of little worm like creature.

119
00:07:51.411 --> 00:07:52.670
There's no fossil record of it.

120
00:07:52.671 --> 00:07:56.060
This is very much a sort of tentative reconstruction.
Uh,

121
00:07:56.061 --> 00:08:01.061
but it was something like the first animal that had left right symmetry as part

122
00:08:01.311 --> 00:08:05.420
of its body plan.
It had a left and right as well as a top and bottom.

123
00:08:06.470 --> 00:08:10.880
And,
um,
this body plan evolved in the EDL ackeren.

124
00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:14.390
Most of the animals that we're familiar with,

125
00:08:14.420 --> 00:08:17.720
our bilateria animals,
they have that kind of left,

126
00:08:17.721 --> 00:08:20.960
right plan was originally laid down in something like this.

127
00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:25.280
This was probably a very small animal.
Um,
quite simple.

128
00:08:25.281 --> 00:08:27.830
It did have a nervous system almost certainly,

129
00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:32.600
but a simple nervous system most likely.
Um,

130
00:08:32.810 --> 00:08:33.920
so on a slide like that,

131
00:08:33.921 --> 00:08:38.480
we have that animal placed at its particular moment in the tree and everything

132
00:08:38.481 --> 00:08:40.340
down stream,
uh,

133
00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:45.260
sort of on each branch is a bilaterally symmetrical organism including ourselves

134
00:08:45.261 --> 00:08:48.170
and animals,
animals like octopuses.

135
00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:51.950
So the branchings occurred early before,

136
00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:53.900
what's known as the Cambrin explosion.

137
00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:59.070
Then in the Cambrian life changed dramatically rather than soft body animals

138
00:08:59.071 --> 00:09:01.920
would look a bit like macaroons or bath mats.

139
00:09:02.070 --> 00:09:06.330
You have animals that looked something like this.
You have hard parts,

140
00:09:06.331 --> 00:09:10.650
spines clause.
You have complex sensory mechanisms,

141
00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:12.750
especially complex eyes.

142
00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:17.340
And it is very likely that this is when animals began to have much more to do

143
00:09:17.341 --> 00:09:22.260
with each other,
especially as predators and prey.
From there,

144
00:09:22.261 --> 00:09:26.280
you get lots of downstream evolution and this takes us through something that

145
00:09:26.281 --> 00:09:29.580
can be roughly summarized with a picture like this.

146
00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:36.360
Lots of animals come from this early bilateria and uh,

147
00:09:36.450 --> 00:09:38.670
this early bilaterial lineage.

148
00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:43.680
And in a few groups you have the evolution of lodge Brian's and complex

149
00:09:43.681 --> 00:09:44.514
behavior.

150
00:09:45.210 --> 00:09:48.840
You have firstly the evolution of large brains and complex behavior.

151
00:09:48.870 --> 00:09:52.530
In our group,
in the vertebrates,
many vertebrates are like this,

152
00:09:52.531 --> 00:09:57.240
especially in mammals and birds and in what we informally refer to as

153
00:09:57.241 --> 00:09:58.890
invertebrates.
All the others,

154
00:09:59.130 --> 00:10:03.990
you mostly have animals that have small nervous systems and relatively simple

155
00:10:03.991 --> 00:10:06.660
behavior.
But with one big exception,

156
00:10:07.380 --> 00:10:11.670
the cephalopods a group of mollusks.
Um,

157
00:10:12.690 --> 00:10:17.670
here we have a lodge near the system,
one in the vertebrate brain,
sorry,

158
00:10:17.671 --> 00:10:19.260
in the Vertebra Range,

159
00:10:19.590 --> 00:10:24.590
roughly 500 million neurons in the case of an octopus and the most recent common

160
00:10:26.161 --> 00:10:31.161
ancestor of you on one side and an octopus on the other with it's very large

161
00:10:31.651 --> 00:10:33.990
[inaudible] system was that very simple,

162
00:10:33.991 --> 00:10:38.340
warm light preacher living in the EDF 600 million years ago.

163
00:10:38.730 --> 00:10:43.200
So what we really have is independent evolution from that point down,

164
00:10:43.201 --> 00:10:48.201
two sides and something we can think of as two independent experiments,

165
00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:52.920
evolutionary experiments in the,
in the,
uh,

166
00:10:53.130 --> 00:10:57.090
origin of large nervous systems and complex brains.

167
00:10:57.420 --> 00:11:02.420
So I cephalopod is what we were looking at the results of the one experiment

168
00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:07.350
outside our line in the evolution of a large,

169
00:11:07.410 --> 00:11:08.970
really large nervous system.

170
00:11:09.210 --> 00:11:12.780
And I think of this consequently as the closest we'll ever come to meeting an

171
00:11:12.781 --> 00:11:16.710
intelligent alien.
When I say that,
I mean the following.

172
00:11:16.711 --> 00:11:19.020
If you think about what it would be like to meet an alien,

173
00:11:19.170 --> 00:11:23.850
the big fact about an alien is that it's an intelligent form of life that has no

174
00:11:23.851 --> 00:11:25.860
common ancestor with us at all.

175
00:11:25.861 --> 00:11:30.150
Something from a totally separate evolutionary lineage,
an octopus,

176
00:11:30.151 --> 00:11:31.860
you're certainly not like that,

177
00:11:32.190 --> 00:11:36.240
but the common ancestor is so far away and probably quite simple.

178
00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:37.560
And as a result,

179
00:11:37.590 --> 00:11:42.360
most of what we see arose independently in the roughly 600 million years ago

180
00:11:42.450 --> 00:11:44.070
since that common ancestor.

181
00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:49.870
So what did we get on the other side?
Uh,
and why did we get it?
Well,

182
00:11:49.900 --> 00:11:53.470
we get a mixture of similarities and differences from,
uh,

183
00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:55.000
things like ourselves.

184
00:11:55.450 --> 00:11:59.920
The most conspicuous similarity between a cephalopod and uh,

185
00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:04.940
a vertebrate is the eye cephalopods independently evolved a camera eye.

186
00:12:05.170 --> 00:12:08.740
So this is a giant cuddle fish,
which is the same kind of I as an octopus,

187
00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:13.000
a camera I with a lens that focuses an image on a retina.

188
00:12:13.630 --> 00:12:17.530
You also have various sophisticated kinds of learning.

189
00:12:18.310 --> 00:12:19.121
And lastly,

190
00:12:19.121 --> 00:12:23.320
something that was really the beginning of my own fascination with these
animals.

191
00:12:23.590 --> 00:12:25.750
There's a kind of engagement,
uh,

192
00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:28.630
that these animals display when you interact with them.

193
00:12:28.900 --> 00:12:32.830
The first ones I came across myself would not octopuses but giant cuddle fish.

194
00:12:32.830 --> 00:12:36.570
Like uh,
this guy here,
this animal was probably,
uh,

195
00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:39.790
sort of between two and three feet long.
They're not small.

196
00:12:40.210 --> 00:12:44.650
I was snorkeling near Sydney and saw under alleged something moving around,

197
00:12:44.890 --> 00:12:48.820
went down and had a look at it.
And as I thought from the surface,

198
00:12:48.821 --> 00:12:53.110
it was a large animal and something very active.
And the two striking,

199
00:12:53.111 --> 00:12:57.400
the two most striking things about it were firstly the astounding array of

200
00:12:57.401 --> 00:13:00.310
college changes that it was producing.
As I watched it,

201
00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:04.990
these animals can change the entire color of their skin in much less than a

202
00:13:04.991 --> 00:13:06.850
second.
And secondly,

203
00:13:06.851 --> 00:13:11.290
the fact that this animal seem about as interested in me as I was in it,

204
00:13:11.470 --> 00:13:14.710
there's a kind of a feeling of meeting you can have with these animals,

205
00:13:14.950 --> 00:13:18.040
which is I take it unique when animal,
when a,

206
00:13:18.050 --> 00:13:20.440
when a person meets another invertebrate.

207
00:13:20.620 --> 00:13:23.590
And quite rare when we made any animal,

208
00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:27.850
just to give you a sense of the capacity for college change,

209
00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:31.210
these two photographs were taken a four seconds apart.

210
00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:36.130
So a giant cuddle fish can completely transform it,

211
00:13:36.131 --> 00:13:38.710
skin to that yellow in less than a second,

212
00:13:38.950 --> 00:13:43.390
and then take it back to that reddish pattern,
uh,
a few seconds later.

213
00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:47.920
And this image also gives you a sense of the fact that it's not just whole

214
00:13:47.921 --> 00:13:52.420
colors that they can produce,
but very complex stripes and bands,
uh,

215
00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:55.090
dynamic as well as static patterns as well.

216
00:13:57.400 --> 00:14:02.080
So how did they come to be animals that could do these things?

217
00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:06.370
Let's talk a little bit about the cephalopod brain and the kind of being that

218
00:14:06.371 --> 00:14:08.710
these animals are.
So as I said,

219
00:14:08.730 --> 00:14:12.160
there are roughly 500 million neurons in an octopus.

220
00:14:12.310 --> 00:14:14.230
The number is not really known for cuddle fish,

221
00:14:14.231 --> 00:14:19.231
but they may have even a slightly higher ratio of our brain weight to body

222
00:14:19.281 --> 00:14:19.601
weight.

223
00:14:19.601 --> 00:14:24.601
Then octopuses have the big difference between them and us is the fact that more

224
00:14:25.870 --> 00:14:29.680
than half of the neurons in an octopus are not where you'd expect to find them

225
00:14:29.681 --> 00:14:33.910
in the head,
but spread through the body,
especially within the arms themselves.

226
00:14:34.210 --> 00:14:39.210
And each of the arms appears to have some degree of autonomy as a kind of quasi

227
00:14:41.020 --> 00:14:44.800
agent.
Now how did this come to happen?

228
00:14:45.190 --> 00:14:48.250
We can put some of it into context by looking at the,

229
00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:50.890
the lies that will leave and history of this particular,

230
00:14:51.650 --> 00:14:56.510
so here's a reconstruction of what,
uh,
an ancestor,
an early,

231
00:14:56.990 --> 00:15:01.100
early nish ancestor of present day.
CEPHALOPODS might've looked like,
uh,

232
00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:03.980
back in the palliate back in the Paleozoic.

233
00:15:04.250 --> 00:15:07.160
This is a lodge shelled predator.

234
00:15:07.910 --> 00:15:10.730
At some point in that it animal evolution,

235
00:15:10.731 --> 00:15:15.731
the shells were abandoned and what you're left with was a body with a kind of

236
00:15:15.890 --> 00:15:17.540
immense flexibility.

237
00:15:18.410 --> 00:15:22.040
You should think by the way about an octopus arms or a cuddle fishes arms,

238
00:15:22.250 --> 00:15:27.250
not so much his arms but really as kind of eight or 10 enormous lips and those

239
00:15:28.910 --> 00:15:32.240
enormous multi shaped lips,
uh,

240
00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:35.630
extremely useful things if you can control them.

241
00:15:35.900 --> 00:15:39.110
But they are extremely difficult things to control.

242
00:15:39.350 --> 00:15:43.250
Now in us when we move our joints,
give our movements guidance,

243
00:15:43.251 --> 00:15:48.251
you don't have to tell your arm every detail about where to go in an octopus

244
00:15:48.621 --> 00:15:51.140
with no joints and no hard parts at all.

245
00:15:51.290 --> 00:15:53.960
The arm can be essentially any shape and length.

246
00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:57.750
So you would either have to specify exactly,
uh,

247
00:15:57.830 --> 00:16:02.150
the fine details of all its motions or gives the arm a little bit of freedom to

248
00:16:02.151 --> 00:16:04.760
work out the details if it's motions itself.

249
00:16:05.150 --> 00:16:10.100
And it does seem that there has been a sort of partial delegation of control,

250
00:16:10.380 --> 00:16:13.310
uh,
to the arms of an octopus by evolution.

251
00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:17.210
Each of them has a many senses.
Whenever an octopus touches you,

252
00:16:17.300 --> 00:16:21.650
it's tasting you as well as feeling you'll shite.
And they seem to do,

253
00:16:21.651 --> 00:16:23.180
at least they seem interested,

254
00:16:23.181 --> 00:16:26.690
have determined that at least the details of many of their emotions themselves

255
00:16:27.020 --> 00:16:30.890
and also engage in a kind of exploration on their own.

256
00:16:31.250 --> 00:16:34.400
So here are a couple of photos that give you a sense of the contrast here.

257
00:16:34.790 --> 00:16:38.120
So firstly we have uh,
two,
uh,

258
00:16:38.150 --> 00:16:42.320
screenshots from the video in which this octopus is reaching aggressively for

259
00:16:42.321 --> 00:16:45.080
another one.
And in a shot like this,

260
00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:49.970
the arm seems very much like a sort of tool directed by the animal as a whole.

261
00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:54.170
It's reaching with one arm for this guy.
Uh,

262
00:16:54.171 --> 00:16:58.640
and in this case,
uh,
successfully,
uh,
successfully seizing it.

263
00:16:59.780 --> 00:17:03.380
This kind of picture gives the opposite impression.
I don't have a video of this,

264
00:17:03.430 --> 00:17:06.800
uh,
sequence,
unfortunately just a,
just an image,

265
00:17:06.890 --> 00:17:09.530
but you're not the person that's sitting there doing nothing in particular.

266
00:17:09.890 --> 00:17:11.060
And one of the arms,

267
00:17:11.090 --> 00:17:15.410
the red area there indicates the extent of it has just kind of wandered off in a

268
00:17:15.411 --> 00:17:20.000
way that looked to me as if it was apparently more or less self directed.

269
00:17:20.060 --> 00:17:23.390
A kind of exploratory behavior by the arm on its own.

270
00:17:24.950 --> 00:17:29.950
Now given all this and natural question to ask next is what might it be like to

271
00:17:30.771 --> 00:17:32.330
be an octopus?

272
00:17:33.140 --> 00:17:37.370
Is it like anything to be an octopus?
Um,
look,

273
00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:41.360
I think these questions are,
of course very hard to answer.
I think the answer,

274
00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:44.570
does it feel like something to be an octopus is yes.

275
00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:48.900
The harder question is how to address rigorously,
um,

276
00:17:48.950 --> 00:17:52.080
a problem of that kind.
Now the first thing to note,

277
00:17:52.110 --> 00:17:57.110
I think is that a reasonable view has it that a certain kind of experience in

278
00:17:57.961 --> 00:18:02.961
animals just comes with a certain degree of complexity in sensing and responding

279
00:18:03.180 --> 00:18:07.410
and acting upon the world that runs deep in animal evolution.

280
00:18:07.411 --> 00:18:10.740
Octopuses are exemplars of that kind of capacity.

281
00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:16.520
Another more specific thing I think it's worth looking for is evidence of,

282
00:18:17.010 --> 00:18:18.810
uh,
things like pain.

283
00:18:19.020 --> 00:18:24.020
So lots of what might look superficially like pain related behaviors in various

284
00:18:25.141 --> 00:18:30.120
animals,
especially invertebrates are probably,
or possibly quite misleading.

285
00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:35.480
They may not be good indicators of felt pain of a kind of interior sensation of

286
00:18:36.121 --> 00:18:40.800
the salt,
uh,
that comprises pain in us.
Um,
one.

287
00:18:40.850 --> 00:18:41.790
So then the question arises,

288
00:18:41.810 --> 00:18:44.970
how can you look for behavior that shows something non reflexive,

289
00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:47.010
something that's indicative or suggestive,

290
00:18:47.011 --> 00:18:51.180
at least that feels like something to be an animal of a certain kind in pain.

291
00:18:51.660 --> 00:18:54.660
And one good example that's being looked at in several groups recently,

292
00:18:54.661 --> 00:18:57.060
his wound tending,
you can ask the question,

293
00:18:57.210 --> 00:19:02.210
which animals will tend to damage pot protect it from being touched by other

294
00:19:02.341 --> 00:19:06.330
objects and stimuli.
Uh,
as,
as as time goes on,

295
00:19:06.570 --> 00:19:10.470
we got an interesting series of shots of an octopus,
uh,

296
00:19:10.490 --> 00:19:13.740
exhibiting pain related behavior.
This is a,

297
00:19:13.860 --> 00:19:18.030
in some ways the sort of comical shot,
uh,
not so much to the octopus.

298
00:19:18.031 --> 00:19:22.230
I think this was a large aggressive octopus who was trying to dominate a

299
00:19:22.231 --> 00:19:24.630
particular site I'll talk about shortly.

300
00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:29.160
And one of the things he did in his attempts to dominate was raise his rear end,

301
00:19:29.161 --> 00:19:32.700
very high above his body in these sort of size displays.

302
00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:36.540
And in one particular occasion where he raised his rear end very high,
uh,

303
00:19:36.541 --> 00:19:38.820
fish came in and beat him really hard,

304
00:19:38.821 --> 00:19:41.550
right on the end of his body there.

305
00:19:41.550 --> 00:19:45.930
And you can see the fish biting these fish by the way,
are very unpleasant,

306
00:19:46.050 --> 00:19:50.230
uh,
to buy.
Even if you're a person.
I've been bitten by them and it's,
uh,

307
00:19:50.270 --> 00:19:52.100
it's not nice.
Uh,

308
00:19:52.110 --> 00:19:56.880
the octopus behaved exactly like a person sort of with this very Staffold leap,

309
00:19:56.881 --> 00:20:01.080
an arms carrying everywhere.
I was curious whether he would tend the wound.

310
00:20:01.081 --> 00:20:03.440
He did not.
Instead he went,
uh,

311
00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:06.480
back to beating up other octopus's.

312
00:20:08.370 --> 00:20:12.540
So an octopus has sort of reasonably good evidence I think of various kinds of

313
00:20:12.541 --> 00:20:13.740
subjective experience.

314
00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:17.760
The special element and the question I think that's particularly intriguing
here,

315
00:20:17.761 --> 00:20:22.761
concerns what kind of sense of self there might be in an animal of this kind and

316
00:20:23.341 --> 00:20:27.930
how different that would be in an octopus ended in a more centralized neurally

317
00:20:27.931 --> 00:20:30.060
centralized animal like ourselves.

318
00:20:30.390 --> 00:20:35.050
So we can ask which activities and octopus engages in,
uh,
uh,

319
00:20:35.100 --> 00:20:37.230
experienced as,
uh,

320
00:20:37.250 --> 00:20:42.250
as my actions as offered by the individual as opposed to things that just happen

321
00:20:43.380 --> 00:20:46.770
and are observed by the central animal,
uh,

322
00:20:46.870 --> 00:20:51.870
by means of those semi agent like arms in a talk I gave last week.

323
00:20:52.540 --> 00:20:57.070
I'm a Grad student at University of Pennsylvania,
uh,

324
00:20:58.150 --> 00:20:59.950
made a suggestion instead of obvious in retrospect,

325
00:20:59.951 --> 00:21:02.980
but I hadn't thought about it much before,
which is that,
well,

326
00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:04.900
they need not be a single answer to this question.

327
00:21:04.901 --> 00:21:08.800
It might be that when an octopus is doing is already sort of focused intentional

328
00:21:08.801 --> 00:21:10.480
behavior like that reach.
And if I do,

329
00:21:10.481 --> 00:21:15.481
I had there then as a kind of single agent like subject to the experience,

330
00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:20.560
but that might sort of lapse or fall away and be replaced by a more distributed,

331
00:21:20.561 --> 00:21:25.561
less self-like entity when you're seeing individual exploration by the arms.

332
00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:31.630
So these are some of the questions that we'd like to ask.
A sort of mixture of,

333
00:21:31.690 --> 00:21:36.070
uh,
philosophical and scientific questions about these animals and work is

334
00:21:36.071 --> 00:21:39.550
continuing on this.
Um,
in the last part of this talk,

335
00:21:39.551 --> 00:21:44.470
what I'll do is just show us some shots and some videos from a particular site.

336
00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:47.860
A were,
a lot of these photos were taken and octopus site,
uh,

337
00:21:47.890 --> 00:21:52.630
that we call AUC topless,
which is a written about in some detail in the book.

338
00:21:52.690 --> 00:21:56.950
This is a site on the east coast of Australia.
Okay.

339
00:21:56.951 --> 00:21:59.410
Here's the first video.
Oh,
here we go.

340
00:21:59.980 --> 00:22:03.940
This just gives you a sense of what this site is like in on a sort of typical

341
00:22:03.940 --> 00:22:04.210
day.

342
00:22:04.210 --> 00:22:09.210
You've got a large number of shells on a shale bed and various octopuses who,

343
00:22:09.790 --> 00:22:10.623
uh,

344
00:22:10.630 --> 00:22:15.630
in residents and what's believed about octopuses in general is they're not very

345
00:22:15.851 --> 00:22:16.930
social animals.

346
00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:21.220
It's unusual for them to have to interact with each other in decent numbers.

347
00:22:21.310 --> 00:22:25.840
But at this particular site in Australia that we study that essentially had to,

348
00:22:25.900 --> 00:22:27.760
had to learn to get along.

349
00:22:28.450 --> 00:22:33.450
The view we have is that it's a site where there's an abundance of food,

350
00:22:34.120 --> 00:22:34.690
uh,

351
00:22:34.690 --> 00:22:39.690
but a great scarcity of decent den sites and one particular area,

352
00:22:40.060 --> 00:22:40.570
an area,

353
00:22:40.570 --> 00:22:45.250
but there was perhaps seeded by a single human left object of unknown origin,

354
00:22:45.490 --> 00:22:50.080
provided a kind of seed around which a crystal like growth occurred,

355
00:22:50.140 --> 00:22:52.870
whereby octopus's came to live in large numbers.

356
00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:57.580
And a lot of the time they engage in sort of mild controlled aggression.

357
00:22:58.060 --> 00:23:01.720
Occasionally they engage in more intense aggression.

358
00:23:02.140 --> 00:23:06.460
So this animal on the left here is in fact the octopus who is bitten on the rear

359
00:23:06.461 --> 00:23:08.830
end by uh,
the fish we saw earlier.

360
00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:13.420
And this is a sort of typical dice of him engaging in a series of fights where

361
00:23:13.421 --> 00:23:17.170
he attempts to control access to this pretty large side,

362
00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:20.320
the side about aside about the size of this stage.

363
00:23:20.770 --> 00:23:25.510
And he's appeared to be able to far as we could tell to determine with some

364
00:23:25.511 --> 00:23:28.930
reliability the sexes of individuals coming on and off the site.

365
00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:34.320
And I tried to exclude other males so we engaged in a series of fights and um,

366
00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:40.920
and much of the time did succeed in excluding them a feature that's also unique

367
00:23:41.651 --> 00:23:43.750
it,
this slide is a kind of signaling,

368
00:23:43.900 --> 00:23:46.730
this is the kind of display or talked about briefly earlier,

369
00:23:47.060 --> 00:23:51.350
we're animals who are aggressive will go up very large and dark,

370
00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:54.050
maximizing that darkness and size.

371
00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:58.160
And if you look closely at the animal who is about to chase,

372
00:23:58.430 --> 00:24:02.150
you'll see this animal has gone Pale.
But more specifically,

373
00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:06.890
you'll see that it has done a color change such that half of its body,

374
00:24:07.190 --> 00:24:12.190
the half facing the attacking octopus is a kind of high contrast models sort of

375
00:24:12.351 --> 00:24:13.160
color.

376
00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:18.160
And the other half of its body facing away is a kind of simple camouflage.

377
00:24:18.620 --> 00:24:21.200
Now we're not sure exactly why that is.
The,

378
00:24:21.201 --> 00:24:25.940
the sort of high contrast pattern on the side facing,
uh,

379
00:24:25.970 --> 00:24:30.920
has a role in various cephalopod,
uh,
behaviors as a kind of,

380
00:24:31.210 --> 00:24:34.550
uh,
w w 400 called a d mathic display.

381
00:24:34.551 --> 00:24:37.760
The idea is you show this to a Predator and it might start all the predator.

382
00:24:38.060 --> 00:24:42.520
It's possible as being sort of pressed into service as an attempt to,
uh,

383
00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:47.030
in a few tile way startled this oncoming octopus.
However,

384
00:24:47.031 --> 00:24:52.031
many individuals produce fifth display when they're not trying to run away,

385
00:24:52.491 --> 00:24:56.390
but trying to kind of,
uh,
um,

386
00:24:56.900 --> 00:25:01.520
creep onto the slide under the guise of another animal in a nonaggressive
manner.

387
00:25:01.700 --> 00:25:06.410
So we suspect that it may have been pressed into service as a kind of indicator

388
00:25:06.411 --> 00:25:10.010
of non aggressive tendencies,
uh,
in these animals.

389
00:25:10.220 --> 00:25:14.300
And then the question arises,
is this something that isn't a widespread,

390
00:25:14.301 --> 00:25:19.250
but here the two unseen feature of this behavior across the species?

391
00:25:19.430 --> 00:25:23.570
Or is it something that just developed in the particular peculiar social media

392
00:25:23.780 --> 00:25:24.830
of this site?

393
00:25:25.730 --> 00:25:29.960
Another thing that's an unusual feature of this site is what we've come to call

394
00:25:29.961 --> 00:25:33.480
a kind of high five behavior.
So this octopus,
uh,

395
00:25:33.490 --> 00:25:37.040
on the right there is moving across towards the others.
And as it goes,

396
00:25:37.041 --> 00:25:40.520
they'll often be a kind of,
I originally called this boxing,

397
00:25:40.521 --> 00:25:44.210
but now I realize I was being too pugilistic in my metaphors.

398
00:25:44.660 --> 00:25:49.660
And it might be a kind of slap of recognition or something like indication of

399
00:25:49.671 --> 00:25:53.330
roles on the site that animals do by a sort of just sort of jabbing at each

400
00:25:53.331 --> 00:25:54.750
other with the ums.

401
00:25:56.240 --> 00:25:59.210
This is a picture of me at the site,
uh,

402
00:25:59.270 --> 00:26:02.180
try to fix a camera while a whole bunch of stuff goes on around me,

403
00:26:02.210 --> 00:26:04.430
none of which I'm able to see going on.

404
00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:09.740
So we only sometimes successfully look at them.
Uh,

405
00:26:09.770 --> 00:26:13.310
they often quite successfully,
uh,
observe us.

406
00:26:13.340 --> 00:26:17.090
This is a octopus inspecting one of our go pro cameras.
Uh,

407
00:26:17.150 --> 00:26:20.180
possibly as a preliminary to taking it apart.

408
00:26:21.290 --> 00:26:24.050
So I'll stop there.
Happy to take a few questions.
Uh,

409
00:26:24.051 --> 00:26:28.220
I think you'll agree these are truly a fascinating and stunning animals.

410
00:26:34.020 --> 00:26:34.853
<v 3>Okay.</v>

411
00:26:36.810 --> 00:26:40.590
<v 1>Thanks for the talk.
It was very,
very cool to see that.
Um,</v>

412
00:26:40.980 --> 00:26:44.400
so probably the most remarkable thing about the chameleon

413
00:26:44.850 --> 00:26:49.240
<v 4>experiment with intelligence,
I would say is our incredible memories.
Um,</v>

414
00:26:49.590 --> 00:26:53.380
it's hard,
difficult to imagine what my sense of self would be like without,
um,

415
00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:56.670
that,
that kind of memory.
What kind of memory to the cephalopods have,

416
00:26:57.500 --> 00:27:01.490
<v 1>there's some interesting new work on this in cuddle fish,
which is interesting,</v>

417
00:27:01.491 --> 00:27:06.320
particularly in a continuity's between the human and this case.

418
00:27:06.410 --> 00:27:08.930
Uh,
so in,
in the case of humans,

419
00:27:08.931 --> 00:27:13.130
this sort of a standard distinction between forms of memory,
um,

420
00:27:13.780 --> 00:27:16.640
the sort of memory of how to do things,
procedural memory,

421
00:27:16.700 --> 00:27:19.160
what's called semantic memory,
memory of facts.
You know,

422
00:27:19.161 --> 00:27:23.810
the fact that Paris is the capital of France and episodic memory is memory of

423
00:27:23.811 --> 00:27:27.470
what happened to you of experiences and the kind of memory that you were

424
00:27:27.471 --> 00:27:32.180
describing is very sort of distinctive to human experiences.
Is that kind?

425
00:27:32.480 --> 00:27:36.440
So a good question is which animals might have something like episodic memory

426
00:27:36.470 --> 00:27:40.370
memory,
not just of facts,
you know,
where things are,

427
00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:44.270
but of what experiences I had when I was in that place.

428
00:27:44.660 --> 00:27:48.970
And recently some work that's been used to study episodic memory or rather

429
00:27:49.280 --> 00:27:54.280
episodic like memory in birds has been also applied to cuddle fish.

430
00:27:55.190 --> 00:27:59.000
Uh,
and when I went describe all the details of the experimental design,

431
00:27:59.001 --> 00:28:01.070
which was very clever and subtle,

432
00:28:01.370 --> 00:28:06.370
but the upshot of it was that it appears that cuddle fish do have the ability to

433
00:28:06.621 --> 00:28:10.400
remember,
not just facts,
like,
you know,
this food can be found there,

434
00:28:10.670 --> 00:28:11.930
but facts of the form.

435
00:28:12.290 --> 00:28:16.730
I was at this location and hour ago and eight or I was at this other location

436
00:28:16.731 --> 00:28:20.630
two hours ago and didn't eat.
So a sense of,

437
00:28:20.680 --> 00:28:25.070
I kind of,
uh,
not just sort of facts about the world,

438
00:28:25.071 --> 00:28:29.890
but facts about what I have done in way I have been.
So,
I mean,

439
00:28:29.960 --> 00:28:33.620
this I find,
especially in Thai thing,

440
00:28:33.621 --> 00:28:35.330
because things like this,

441
00:28:35.331 --> 00:28:38.780
there's just no chance that was present in the common ancestor of us in these

442
00:28:38.781 --> 00:28:39.850
animals.
Uh,

443
00:28:39.980 --> 00:28:44.980
so independently the same kind of sense of a self behaving in time appears to

444
00:28:45.741 --> 00:28:48.750
have arisen in several different lines.
Great.
Thank you.

445
00:28:52.470 --> 00:28:55.590
<v 4>What do we know about the visual processing in these animals?</v>

446
00:28:55.720 --> 00:28:59.460
You said that the IRS and the IRS quite similar to the human eye.
Yea,
it does.

447
00:28:59.461 --> 00:29:04.140
It does the animal have a similar organ stimulating,
organized visual Cortex?

448
00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:08.940
<v 1>Not Similarly in general.
Once you get past the eye,</v>

449
00:29:09.120 --> 00:29:11.940
everything becomes different in these,
in these animals.

450
00:29:12.390 --> 00:29:17.390
I'm not that knowledgeable about the neuro physiology of a vision in octopuses.

451
00:29:18.450 --> 00:29:21.330
I can certainly tell you where to look.
The,
the lab,

452
00:29:21.470 --> 00:29:26.470
one of the labs that specializes in this is Benny Harkness lab at Hebrew

453
00:29:28.440 --> 00:29:32.520
University in Jerusalem.
Uh,
they,
they're probably the leading lab,
uh,

454
00:29:32.580 --> 00:29:35.910
with respect to the project of trying to work out.
You know,

455
00:29:35.940 --> 00:29:40.570
how different the organizational properties are of an octopus,

456
00:29:40.571 --> 00:29:41.800
his brain,
ours.

457
00:29:42.190 --> 00:29:47.190
And one thing that they're looking at and have sort of made some claims about is

458
00:29:48.461 --> 00:29:49.900
the idea that with within our mat,

459
00:29:49.990 --> 00:29:54.040
within our brains you have quite a number of instead of map like structures

460
00:29:54.310 --> 00:29:55.350
where the,

461
00:29:55.490 --> 00:29:59.610
the sort of sensory array on the body maps to sort of adjacent or you know,

462
00:29:59.650 --> 00:30:04.650
neighbor related neurons in the brain and that seems to be absent in octopuses

463
00:30:05.170 --> 00:30:10.060
and you might think are right.
That has some link to the idea that uh,

464
00:30:10.090 --> 00:30:12.640
there's too many degrees of freedom to control centrally.

465
00:30:12.641 --> 00:30:16.330
So you leave that stuff to the oms or it might have some other explanation.

466
00:30:16.331 --> 00:30:19.000
I don't know.
But he's pipe is,
we'd be the ones to look at.

467
00:30:19.620 --> 00:30:24.570
<v 4>Thank you.
It's really nice to see an actively researching scientist,</v>

468
00:30:24.571 --> 00:30:28.570
not deflationists about subjective experience.
It's pretty refreshing.

469
00:30:28.571 --> 00:30:33.130
But I just wanted to say,
um,
you were getting at you know,

470
00:30:33.160 --> 00:30:37.180
are very linear view on what conscious experiences like as potentially clouding

471
00:30:37.181 --> 00:30:41.340
our view on like what it can be and how to fit it into a scientific world

472
00:30:41.341 --> 00:30:43.180
worldview.
But you didn't really flesh out,

473
00:30:43.181 --> 00:30:47.140
like what sort of future research program you had in mind for the types of like

474
00:30:47.141 --> 00:30:51.150
different organizations of say,
like see like cells,
um,

475
00:30:51.250 --> 00:30:56.250
for the future of fitting subjective experience into the scientific kind of

476
00:30:56.440 --> 00:30:57.800
Canon.
So what,

477
00:30:57.801 --> 00:31:02.290
what sort of research program for solving the Chaunra style hard problem do you

478
00:31:02.291 --> 00:31:03.124
envision?

479
00:31:05.850 --> 00:31:09.000
<v 1>Okay,
that's a very big question indeed.
Uh,</v>

480
00:31:09.001 --> 00:31:12.640
and my answer would be sort of so many pronged.

481
00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:17.610
It's sort of hard to organize it in a brief,
a reply.

482
00:31:17.611 --> 00:31:19.590
But let me say a couple of things is very quickly.

483
00:31:19.591 --> 00:31:23.940
One is I think that with respect to the sorts of challenges that people like

484
00:31:23.941 --> 00:31:25.380
Charmaz,
uh,

485
00:31:25.500 --> 00:31:30.420
make some of that should be treated in a more critical way.
And we say,
no,
this,

486
00:31:30.421 --> 00:31:32.940
you know,
this,
this kind of barrier is not real.

487
00:31:32.941 --> 00:31:35.910
Or this problem for a materialist view is not real.

488
00:31:36.210 --> 00:31:41.160
So I think a first move that one should make is to reorient our thinking about

489
00:31:41.161 --> 00:31:45.920
the problem in a way that makes,
that's more critical about the,

490
00:31:46.280 --> 00:31:50.460
the sort of unimaginable separability of the mental and the physical,
uh,

491
00:31:50.700 --> 00:31:53.760
the basis for the arguments a of Charmaz and others.

492
00:31:54.090 --> 00:31:57.480
So criticized that then choose the right thing to explain.

493
00:31:57.540 --> 00:32:00.690
And I think the right thing to explain,
uh,

494
00:32:01.320 --> 00:32:05.820
is not sort of consciousness as the sort of first target or what philosophy is

495
00:32:05.821 --> 00:32:09.840
often referred to as Qualia.
The kind of rule feel of experience.

496
00:32:10.320 --> 00:32:13.920
But uh,
subjectivity,
that's the right target.
You know,

497
00:32:14.040 --> 00:32:18.750
how is it that some physical systems can comprise subjects that have a point of

498
00:32:18.751 --> 00:32:22.260
view?
Once you understand that and where they came from,

499
00:32:22.560 --> 00:32:26.760
I think it will be possible to explain subjective experience as something that

500
00:32:26.761 --> 00:32:29.040
happens to subjects.
Now.

501
00:32:29.041 --> 00:32:34.041
How can we give a scientific rode into the understanding of subjectivity in a

502
00:32:34.681 --> 00:32:39.530
sense that's relevant,
uh,
to that,
uh,
question.
Um,

503
00:32:40.580 --> 00:32:43.970
uh,
you know,
here I think there are lots of things,

504
00:32:44.630 --> 00:32:47.060
lots of things to think about.
I mean,
giving a talk at Google,

505
00:32:47.061 --> 00:32:51.020
it's very tempting to say something about attempts to come up with artificial

506
00:32:51.021 --> 00:32:54.800
systems that are relevant.
And,
um,

507
00:32:54.830 --> 00:32:59.830
I think what evolution had to do that was a big deal in this area was tight,

508
00:33:00.210 --> 00:33:00.460
you know,

509
00:33:00.460 --> 00:33:04.850
clausy autonomous selves that consents and signal and interact in certain ways

510
00:33:05.150 --> 00:33:10.150
and have a kind of subject like status in a very minimal sense on their own and

511
00:33:10.581 --> 00:33:13.160
coordinate them such that the subject,

512
00:33:13.190 --> 00:33:17.060
the sort of protos subjectivity of those parts becomes sort of,

513
00:33:18.210 --> 00:33:20.210
subsumed might not be quite the right word,

514
00:33:20.211 --> 00:33:22.790
but it'll do for now into the subjectivity,

515
00:33:22.850 --> 00:33:27.320
into the subjectivity of the collective that results.
Um,

516
00:33:27.500 --> 00:33:32.500
I think classical AI did not think about the problem like that at all.

517
00:33:33.050 --> 00:33:37.300
And even contemporary robotics tends to start from a more sort of straight

518
00:33:37.301 --> 00:33:39.560
forwardly centralized organization.

519
00:33:40.220 --> 00:33:44.000
And I certainly think it will be intriguing to sort of think about the problem

520
00:33:44.660 --> 00:33:49.460
via the same path by which evolution thought about the problem,
which is,
uh,

521
00:33:49.880 --> 00:33:54.530
uh,
unity in call activity with respect to systems of that con,

522
00:33:57.820 --> 00:34:02.450
I think.
Thanks.
Great Talk.
Um,
so yeah.
Oh,
sorry.

523
00:34:02.810 --> 00:34:04.650
That's fine.
Please go ahead.
Okay,
well good.

524
00:34:05.170 --> 00:34:07.340
<v 4>Yeah,
sure.
Um,
I,
uh,</v>

525
00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:12.760
a lot of what I've been reading about intelligent from sort of a neuroscience

526
00:34:12.761 --> 00:34:17.761
point of view seems to me to lead into direction of saying that,

527
00:34:18.100 --> 00:34:22.000
uh,
intelligence as we understand it is,
is sort of irreducibly social.

528
00:34:22.420 --> 00:34:26.850
I mean the,
I think the signaling and,
and,
uh,
uh,

529
00:34:27.180 --> 00:34:28.740
the signaling aspect and this,

530
00:34:28.750 --> 00:34:33.750
the idea of a sense of self coming out of a model of,

531
00:34:34.490 --> 00:34:36.820
of,
of others.
Uh,
and,
uh,

532
00:34:36.821 --> 00:34:41.320
so I'm intrigued because it seems that that these animals are capable of,

533
00:34:41.321 --> 00:34:45.430
of very,
very complex signaling,
but also you said they're not very social.

534
00:34:45.431 --> 00:34:46.810
So I wonder what,

535
00:34:47.080 --> 00:34:52.080
how much do you think their intelligence is social is engaged in signaling and,

536
00:34:53.170 --> 00:34:57.250
and,
and sensing the other other animals?

537
00:34:58.100 --> 00:34:59.390
<v 1>I think for the most part,</v>

538
00:34:59.391 --> 00:35:04.391
cephalopods are a lesson pushing against those highly socialized conceptions of

539
00:35:05.301 --> 00:35:08.080
intelligence that are very popular in many,
uh,

540
00:35:08.240 --> 00:35:13.070
many theoretical domains at the moment.
Um,
so if,
you know,

541
00:35:13.071 --> 00:35:16.520
if you,
I mean as a,
as a philosopher,

542
00:35:16.530 --> 00:35:20.660
much of the time there are some philosophers who emphasize the sort of to and

543
00:35:20.661 --> 00:35:25.610
fro and sociality and there are some philosophers who emphasize the richness of

544
00:35:25.611 --> 00:35:29.780
the individual's experience and of particularity and cephalopods are sort of

545
00:35:29.781 --> 00:35:32.750
with the,
with the second group there with William James,

546
00:35:32.850 --> 00:35:37.800
a sort of individualistic style.
Um,
and um,

547
00:35:37.890 --> 00:35:41.140
I think that's just something we learned from them.
We learned that,
um,

548
00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:46.400
by means some kind of combination of the challenges of living the lives they

549
00:35:46.531 --> 00:35:47.364
live,
uh,

550
00:35:47.460 --> 00:35:51.870
where they're soft bodied there pray for anything of a decent size in the sea.

551
00:35:52.260 --> 00:35:54.510
They're also predators.
They have to get around,

552
00:35:54.511 --> 00:35:59.160
they have to be continually exploring and looking for food.
Um,

553
00:35:59.310 --> 00:36:03.390
and with the bodies that are both so rich with possibility but so hard to

554
00:36:03.391 --> 00:36:04.224
control.

555
00:36:04.320 --> 00:36:07.860
I think we learned that that's enough just to build a very big and complex

556
00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:12.330
nervous system.
Once you have that big and complex nervous system,

557
00:36:13.320 --> 00:36:16.950
it appears that if you put a bunch of them together in an unusually high density

558
00:36:16.951 --> 00:36:19.140
setting,
they'll,
you know,

559
00:36:19.950 --> 00:36:22.860
here on going beyond what I can back up scientifically.

560
00:36:22.861 --> 00:36:24.930
So I'm being very speculative.

561
00:36:25.230 --> 00:36:28.830
I think a lot of the signaling behaviors that we see at AWC topless,

562
00:36:28.831 --> 00:36:33.780
the site in Australia,
uh,
are a kind of improvised sociality.

563
00:36:33.781 --> 00:36:37.680
I think the animal sort of work out a way with their general cleverness to

564
00:36:37.681 --> 00:36:41.700
interact in ways that are not to sort of destructive and chaotic.

565
00:36:42.270 --> 00:36:45.840
So I think they,
I think there are sort of a case on that side,

566
00:36:46.050 --> 00:36:50.610
just what we're talking about,
the ways in which they push against the familiar.

567
00:36:50.610 --> 00:36:55.610
Why is it talking about or thinking about the advantages in evolutionary terms

568
00:36:55.741 --> 00:36:58.170
of having a large brain and high intelligence.

569
00:36:58.680 --> 00:37:02.700
The other weird thing about these animals is their lives are so short and

570
00:37:02.701 --> 00:37:07.410
octopus is dead usually within two years.
Uh,
which is astounding.
Uh,

571
00:37:07.950 --> 00:37:12.950
so in two years they kind of rush through the early stages and acquire quite a

572
00:37:13.321 --> 00:37:17.370
large body in many cases.
Even the giant Pacific Octopus,
which is,
you know,

573
00:37:17.371 --> 00:37:20.700
several hundred pounds of octopus.
Um,

574
00:37:21.240 --> 00:37:23.940
they can live off into about four years.
But that's about it.

575
00:37:23.941 --> 00:37:26.160
And that's the biggest octopus species known.

576
00:37:26.850 --> 00:37:31.290
No one knows the lifespan of a giant squid,
you know,
the really colossal squid,

577
00:37:31.291 --> 00:37:34.350
but it's thought to be of the same kind of order of five years or so.

578
00:37:35.100 --> 00:37:39.300
So they rush through their lives and that would normally be thought to be

579
00:37:39.301 --> 00:37:43.740
something that tells against the advantage of developing a large Brian and all

580
00:37:43.741 --> 00:37:46.380
that learning.
And you've got no time to put it to any use.

581
00:37:46.980 --> 00:37:50.160
So it just compounds the,
it compounds the puzzle in many ways.

582
00:37:50.700 --> 00:37:55.390
<v 4>Great.
Thanks.
Yes,
thank you for this very interesting talk.</v>

583
00:37:55.391 --> 00:38:00.391
So what do you think about the correlation between parenting and intelligence?

584
00:38:01.600 --> 00:38:05.110
That's because Octopi,
do you have kind of parenting,

585
00:38:05.750 --> 00:38:08.240
<v 1>not,
not as the sot that should help</v>

586
00:38:10.160 --> 00:38:13.730
<v 4>parenting.
We do care about where young</v>

587
00:38:14.760 --> 00:38:16.320
<v 1>bought the eggs.
Yeah.</v>

588
00:38:16.330 --> 00:38:21.330
So once this is exactly the right sort of next puzzle to sort of mention after

589
00:38:21.401 --> 00:38:26.050
the previous gentleman's questions.
So in many animals sort of smart,

590
00:38:26.080 --> 00:38:28.720
you have significant parental care.

591
00:38:28.721 --> 00:38:33.721
And the guidance of the next generation along the first steps with octopus's in

592
00:38:34.631 --> 00:38:39.130
general mentioned an exception in a moment or a couple of exceptions in a
moment.

593
00:38:39.400 --> 00:38:43.030
The general pattern is for the the female octopus,
um,

594
00:38:43.090 --> 00:38:48.090
lay some eggs and she tends and broods them and fans them to get exactly the

595
00:38:49.391 --> 00:38:54.100
right level of oxygen in the water that they're interacting with and the eggs

596
00:38:54.101 --> 00:38:58.240
hatch and the larvae float away as plankton and that's it.

597
00:38:58.420 --> 00:39:02.920
And she never sees them again.
So there's care in a sense of,
you know,

598
00:39:02.921 --> 00:39:05.980
the eggs are not abandoned.
Cuddle fish eggs by the way are abandoned.

599
00:39:06.010 --> 00:39:10.800
So the female cuddle fish lays eggs often on a ledge on the,

600
00:39:10.801 --> 00:39:15.070
on the underside of the ledge and then just goes off.
And those eggs will hatch.

601
00:39:15.071 --> 00:39:15.904
They're much more,

602
00:39:16.240 --> 00:39:20.260
they're larger and better provision than octopus eggs and then a bit more
robust.

603
00:39:20.620 --> 00:39:25.600
But when they hatch,
you know,
the,
the,
the parents are long gone,
uh,
dead in fact.

604
00:39:26.080 --> 00:39:30.460
And with octopus's is a bit more care but not care that you would think would

605
00:39:31.210 --> 00:39:33.820
help with the sort of intellectual side of life very much.

606
00:39:33.821 --> 00:39:38.410
Because once the eggs hatch,
they,
the larvae just become plankton.

607
00:39:38.620 --> 00:39:43.620
Now there are a few exceptions where the larvae may at least settle locally.

608
00:39:45.611 --> 00:39:48.940
They,
the,
the,
the larvae are larger when they,
uh,

609
00:39:49.030 --> 00:39:52.180
when the eggs hatch and don't just float away and become plankton.

610
00:39:52.420 --> 00:39:56.020
Not very much is known about them.
There are a few sort of larger egg,
Dr Purses.

611
00:39:56.830 --> 00:39:57.663
But even in that,

612
00:39:57.790 --> 00:40:02.790
I think in general the picture is if you're an octopus from the day that your

613
00:40:03.160 --> 00:40:07.390
hatching from the egg,
you're pretty much on your own and your days are numbered.

614
00:40:12.040 --> 00:40:12.873
<v 2>Yup.</v>

615
00:40:13.110 --> 00:40:16.860
<v 5>So you mentioned the three structure of life lineage and you mentioned that in</v>

616
00:40:16.861 --> 00:40:20.160
some cases there are junctions.
I wonder if you could mention an example of this,

617
00:40:21.060 --> 00:40:25.980
<v 1>right?
So once you get to animals,
genuine junctions,</v>

618
00:40:25.981 --> 00:40:29.340
10 10,
not to occur,
but in single celled life.

619
00:40:29.341 --> 00:40:33.540
So in bacteria you have a quite different shape.
I mean the tree,

620
00:40:33.720 --> 00:40:34.730
the tree metaphor,

621
00:40:34.740 --> 00:40:39.180
the tree model doesn't apply particularly well to bacteria,

622
00:40:39.690 --> 00:40:40.470
um,

623
00:40:40.470 --> 00:40:45.180
that continually exchanging bits and pieces of DNA in a kind of freeway.

624
00:40:45.720 --> 00:40:46.170
Uh,

625
00:40:46.170 --> 00:40:51.170
the eukaryotic cells that make up our bodies are the products of an event where

626
00:40:51.451 --> 00:40:54.250
one,
I'm old,
you know,

627
00:40:54.280 --> 00:40:58.230
ancient prokaryotic cell essentially swallowed and other,

628
00:40:58.470 --> 00:41:01.770
and the two of them came to live as a unit.
So that,

629
00:41:01.920 --> 00:41:05.340
that's a kind of merging in the tree where you know,

630
00:41:05.341 --> 00:41:09.420
all the cells in your body are descended from emerging event that took place

631
00:41:09.450 --> 00:41:13.590
probably perhaps something like 1.8 billion years or so ago.

632
00:41:14.550 --> 00:41:17.880
Uh,
so do you think about the tree of life in a more exact way?

633
00:41:18.120 --> 00:41:20.550
You should think that it's a,
it's a network.

634
00:41:21.270 --> 00:41:26.270
The network in its old and unicellular domains or regions has a sort of somewhat

635
00:41:29.051 --> 00:41:32.790
haphazard,
not really tree like that more complex.

636
00:41:33.830 --> 00:41:36.260
And in some groups,
especially animals,

637
00:41:36.440 --> 00:41:41.150
the thing sort of resolves into a more definite tree where you have to weigh

638
00:41:41.151 --> 00:41:45.560
branchings and,
and as few or no,

639
00:41:46.130 --> 00:41:48.650
not none,
but fewer,
no rejoining.

640
00:41:49.230 --> 00:41:52.850
So the the full pictures is,
it's not quite a tree,

641
00:41:53.300 --> 00:41:56.180
but we animals,
we form a pretty good tree.

642
00:42:00.110 --> 00:42:02.960
Okay.
It's time for one more.
If anyone would like to

643
00:42:04.170 --> 00:42:05.003
<v 3>hip hop.</v>

644
00:42:12.640 --> 00:42:17.640
<v 6>So you had an illustration of the common ancestor of the octopus and mammals?</v>

645
00:42:19.540 --> 00:42:24.230
Yeah.
From my perspective,

646
00:42:24.231 --> 00:42:25.430
when I look at an octopus,

647
00:42:25.431 --> 00:42:30.431
it seems to have a lot of similarities with mammals just in terms of the level

648
00:42:31.041 --> 00:42:35.150
of advancement and complexity and some things like the,

649
00:42:35.450 --> 00:42:38.990
you mentioned the design of the eye are quite similar.
Yup.

650
00:42:39.020 --> 00:42:44.020
How much of that do you think was like latent in the DNA versus how much of that

651
00:42:46.670 --> 00:42:51.670
was truly independent because it was required in the same way,

652
00:42:52.700 --> 00:42:53.300
you know?

653
00:42:53.300 --> 00:42:58.070
Do you think that there were independent mutations in the DNA that were

654
00:42:58.100 --> 00:42:59.680
independently selected for,
or

655
00:43:00.520 --> 00:43:03.100
<v 1>it's a very good question and the words you used Leighton,</v>

656
00:43:03.130 --> 00:43:07.030
I think is exactly the right that's,
that's the right way to ask the question.

657
00:43:07.120 --> 00:43:11.260
So you have some similarities of design in the present,

658
00:43:11.410 --> 00:43:16.410
coming from something that looks very different in the past and there's a school

659
00:43:16.541 --> 00:43:20.590
of thought in biology that I think would answer your question with a kind of

660
00:43:20.591 --> 00:43:23.410
emphatic kiss then say,
oh yeah,
right.
They look very different.

661
00:43:23.650 --> 00:43:28.650
But there was a kind of architecture that was kind of lightened in a way in the

662
00:43:28.871 --> 00:43:33.871
first bilaterally symmetrical animals with a certain kind of head to tail axis,

663
00:43:35.470 --> 00:43:37.150
a certain organization of nerve,

664
00:43:37.180 --> 00:43:42.130
the relationship between nervous system and the rest.
And you know,

665
00:43:42.131 --> 00:43:47.131
you should think of the subsequent unfolding down the two lines as just a kind

666
00:43:47.681 --> 00:43:50.500
of,
you know,
the variations on a theme in a way.

667
00:43:50.950 --> 00:43:53.530
And a theme that was set down early.

668
00:43:53.560 --> 00:43:57.130
That's one kind of school of thought I'm describing as a bit metaphorically I

669
00:43:57.131 --> 00:44:01.480
think.
I think it's clear in this case then as another and in some ways more

670
00:44:01.481 --> 00:44:04.450
traditional school of thought that says,
look,
evolution can do anything.

671
00:44:04.451 --> 00:44:08.950
It pretty much once with with with bodies and you started with something very

672
00:44:08.951 --> 00:44:11.500
simple and um,

673
00:44:11.530 --> 00:44:15.310
the fact that you have certain similarities here and here means that natural

674
00:44:15.311 --> 00:44:17.380
selection,
just five and similar things.

675
00:44:17.381 --> 00:44:21.910
And there were mutations occurring quite independently,
quite different,
uh,

676
00:44:21.940 --> 00:44:25.000
in character that built a similar structure.

677
00:44:25.420 --> 00:44:28.900
Now in the case of having an eye with a lens,

678
00:44:29.170 --> 00:44:30.790
the second view is certainly right.

679
00:44:30.791 --> 00:44:35.430
So there's no sense in which the eye lens was latent in,
uh,

680
00:44:35.431 --> 00:44:40.350
in the common ancestor and octopus lenses and vertebrate lenses are built from

681
00:44:40.351 --> 00:44:44.190
different staff.
They have a different role.
So,
um,

682
00:44:44.790 --> 00:44:49.440
one distorts and one moves.
So camera lenses don't distort.
They move.

683
00:44:49.850 --> 00:44:52.650
Uh,
some animal lenses distort the,
you know,

684
00:44:52.651 --> 00:44:56.070
the change shape and some of them move.
Um,

685
00:44:56.430 --> 00:45:01.430
but the presence of an eye at all in the animal forget the lens and the

686
00:45:01.831 --> 00:45:05.700
particular structure.
But just whether you have light sensitive things,

687
00:45:05.701 --> 00:45:08.940
roughly where they are.
Plenty of biologists think I,

688
00:45:09.120 --> 00:45:11.650
that was probably laid down,
you know,
and,

689
00:45:11.720 --> 00:45:15.360
and it's not something that was independently invented.

690
00:45:15.361 --> 00:45:18.930
It's something that was laid down one time.
So,
I mean,
I,

691
00:45:19.680 --> 00:45:22.260
my expertise such as it is,

692
00:45:22.860 --> 00:45:26.700
is I can't give us a richer answer the question than that because the,
this,

693
00:45:27.240 --> 00:45:29.940
what's you're putting your finger on there is a part of biology which is

694
00:45:29.941 --> 00:45:34.590
intensely and actively debated and there are different reasonable positions.

695
00:45:39.030 --> 00:45:43.050
Okay.
It's about five to natural to wrap up right about now.

696
00:45:45.040 --> 00:45:45.850
Okay.
Thanks.
