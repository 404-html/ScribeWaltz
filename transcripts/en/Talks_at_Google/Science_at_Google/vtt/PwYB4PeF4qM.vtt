WEBVTT

1
00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:12.540
At.
So it's a great pleasure to be here,

2
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:17.520
particularly talking about a subject which unfortunately is now even more

3
00:00:17.521 --> 00:00:21.300
important given the changing politics of the glow.

4
00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:24.990
I'm going to talk about three major aspects.
The first,

5
00:00:24.991 --> 00:00:28.500
I'm going to talk about climate change when I'm also going to talk about

6
00:00:28.501 --> 00:00:32.280
population and development because as I'm going to explain,

7
00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:36.570
I don't think you can do with climate change on its own.

8
00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:40.230
Now this is a radical thoughts cause climate scientist only think about climate.

9
00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.830
However,
I want you to think about all the aspects.

10
00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:49.040
And so therefore I think there are four major challenges in the world apart from

11
00:00:49.441 --> 00:00:51.430
Trump.
Okay?
Um,

12
00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:57.510
so I promised myself I wouldn't,
I,
I lost it about 32 seconds.
Okay.

13
00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.670
This is terrible,
right?
So climate change,
of course,
passionate about that.

14
00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.010
But we also have to deal with global poverty.

15
00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.150
We have to deal with environmental degradation because not everything is due to

16
00:01:09.151 --> 00:01:12.090
climate change.
And of course global security.

17
00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.720
So why are these important?

18
00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:21.540
So less be serious development is essential because at the moment,

19
00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:28.190
7 million children die needlessly every single year or preventable diseases and

20
00:01:29.611 --> 00:01:33.180
starvation.
That's the population of Greater London.

21
00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.930
700 million people go to bed feeling hungry every night and 1 billion people,

22
00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.390
one in seven still do not have access to clean drinking water.

23
00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:49.830
Okay?
So this is why we have to deal with all of these problems together.

24
00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.823
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

25
00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:56.380
<v 0>So why is this the perfect storm?
And I'd love to say yes,
I invented this term,</v>

26
00:01:56.381 --> 00:01:59.500
I didn't,
John Bevington the previous uh,

27
00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:04.490
chief science advisor to the UK government because what he noticed was that

28
00:02:04.491 --> 00:02:07.360
according to the International Energy Authority,

29
00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:12.810
energy demand is going to increase in the next 14 years by about 50% food is

30
00:02:13.871 --> 00:02:18.871
also going to increase by about 50% and to feed that water has to increase by

31
00:02:19.811 --> 00:02:24.280
30% because you need a lot of waters to create energy and food.

32
00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:25.160
Right?

33
00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:29.350
In the middle of this you have climate change and then you also have to external

34
00:02:29.351 --> 00:02:33.100
pressures,
which is of course rapid development and population growth.

35
00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:37.240
So let's start off with climate change.
Okay.

36
00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.690
This is what I do,
a deep sigh.

37
00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:45.790
There is nothing complicated about climate change.

38
00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:49.900
It is just simple physics.
So I can do the whole Brian Cox thing.

39
00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:55.180
It's physics.
Okay,
so
now you've got it.

40
00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:59.740
The reason being is all that happens is the sun produces huge amounts of energy

41
00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:00.700
through fusion,

42
00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:05.290
basically burning hydrogen to make helium releases lots of energy and that

43
00:03:05.291 --> 00:03:07.150
energy hits,
well,

44
00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:11.590
sometimes the sunlight and sometimes it's this murky gray stuff we get in
London,

45
00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:16.210
but we get most of the energy as sunlight.
Okay?

46
00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:17.560
In the visible spectrum.

47
00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:23.370
Now about one third of that bounces straight off into space of because of white

48
00:03:25.511 --> 00:03:29.770
clouds and because of ice,
because of the Albedo,
it reflects it.

49
00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:34.240
You will know that because I'm hopefully Google sent you or skiing through bonds

50
00:03:34.241 --> 00:03:37.360
and to actually make yourself feel better about yourself so you can program

51
00:03:37.361 --> 00:03:42.070
better.
Yes,
please tell me if it's true now.
Okay.

52
00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:47.020
You all have to wear sunglasses because of the reflection of the sunlight off

53
00:03:47.021 --> 00:03:51.820
the ice.
Okay,
so the Albedo of the earth means lots of sunlight is reflected.

54
00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:57.370
Now the interesting thing is a little bit is absorbed by the atmosphere.

55
00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:02.670
Luckily by ozone to ozone catches a little bit of the ultraviolet radiation and

56
00:04:03.311 --> 00:04:08.311
stops you getting skin cancer and has allowed evolution to occur without too

57
00:04:08.801 --> 00:04:10.150
much DNA damage.

58
00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:15.280
But the rest of it passes through the atmospheres if it's not there.
Now,

59
00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:18.640
if you imagine being on that tropical islands,
okay,

60
00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.690
and you're lying out there and that sunlight is hitting you,

61
00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:27.220
the visible light hits you and makes you feel hot.

62
00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:31.090
Cause as it hits you,
it converts to heat.
And the same happens to the earth.

63
00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:34.690
Earth warms up and radiates that heat out.

64
00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:38.940
Now we know the earth radiates the heat out because it's imbalanced.

65
00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:40.360
Otherwise the earth,

66
00:04:40.361 --> 00:04:43.330
we're just continually continue to heat up and heat up and then burn up.

67
00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:48.520
So it's imbalance.
However,
what we have here of the greenhouse gases,

68
00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:51.880
which absorb a little bit of that heat and just keep it warm.

69
00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:57.420
So jokingly early on about sort of doing some sort of communications,

70
00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:02.970
I did a communications with a 13 year olds in a various high score comprehensive

71
00:05:04.991 --> 00:05:08.570
score in west London.
And one of the kids after I was doing this lecture,

72
00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:13.210
when it's like a Dubai,
I'm getting somewhere.

73
00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:15.940
What do you mean?
He's like,
you do that?
Well,
the greenhouse gasses,

74
00:05:15.941 --> 00:05:19.860
they're keeping me warm.
I went,
yes,
I'm getting somewhere.
And I said,

75
00:05:19.861 --> 00:05:24.790
so what's climate change where it's like your mother?
Oh,

76
00:05:24.791 --> 00:05:28.450
I'm not sure where it going here.
This could be problematic.
And went,
okay,

77
00:05:28.451 --> 00:05:30.160
what do you mean are willing winter?

78
00:05:30.161 --> 00:05:34.410
She comes in and puts a blank extra blanket on you and like you.
I said,
well,

79
00:05:34.411 --> 00:05:37.150
does that do?
Oh yeah.
Well it makes me sweat.

80
00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:41.500
Perfect analogy to what we're doing.
So at the greenhouse gases,

81
00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:43.650
we're all obsessed by CO2,

82
00:05:43.651 --> 00:05:47.380
but the major greenhouse gas in the atmosphere is water vapor.
Okay.

83
00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:52.270
Followed by carbon dioxide,
methane,
nitrous oxide and CFCs.

84
00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:57.990
This is the monologue observatory that shows CO2 wise every single year since

85
00:05:59.481 --> 00:06:04.481
1958 when keeling started to measure it and we have now passed in 2016 the 400

86
00:06:08.571 --> 00:06:11.060
parts per million by volume.

87
00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:14.810
Now you're going to say really hurtful.
Does that mean,

88
00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:18.050
so let's have a look at the past.
So this is ice cores.

89
00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:23.150
This is 800,000 years ago,
so nearly a million years ago.
And as you can see,

90
00:06:23.151 --> 00:06:26.990
this is me saying this is CO2.
These are the ice ages,

91
00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:31.580
these are the warm periods.
This is poor person that works at minus five.

92
00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:36.590
Aren't you glad you work at Google?
But this,
this is why it's so exciting.

93
00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:41.740
You get these beautiful slice of ice from the ice cores from Antarctica and

94
00:06:42.321 --> 00:06:44.630
Greenland that actually have bubbles.

95
00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:49.430
These are ancient air trapped.
So as long as you can extract the air,

96
00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:53.510
you have real air to say that's what it was like 200,000 years ago.

97
00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:54.531
And as you can see,

98
00:06:54.531 --> 00:06:59.531
it goes up and down from 200 parts per million to about two 80 parts per

99
00:06:59.811 --> 00:07:04.280
million.
And yeah,
that's what we've done in the last hundred years.
Oops.

100
00:07:04.281 --> 00:07:08.810
So we've uh,
increased CO2 by 40% and doubled methane.
Okay.

101
00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:10.700
We're really trying hard here.
Okay.

102
00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:16.330
So the intergovernmental panel on climate change is mandated by the UN to every

103
00:07:18.051 --> 00:07:21.140
five to six years.
Summarize the science.

104
00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:23.450
I'm say I have all the chapters summarizing site.

105
00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:28.780
Most interesting thing for you is that there is a summary for policy makers that

106
00:07:30.890 --> 00:07:35.890
is a political document because all 192 countries in the UN have agreed to the

107
00:07:38.691 --> 00:07:42.920
wording.
Okay,
lots of politics,
lots of movement,
et Cetera.

108
00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:44.810
So the interesting thing is

109
00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:50.180
all the countries have signed up to the actual summary for policy.

110
00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:51.950
So what does this report say?

111
00:07:53.090 --> 00:07:56.240
It basically says there's this huge weight of evidence for climate change.

112
00:07:56.480 --> 00:08:00.620
This is the temperature curve for the whole planet measured for that last

113
00:08:00.621 --> 00:08:05.480
hundred and 50 years.
Now,
if anybody shows you one curve,
disbelieve them,

114
00:08:05.481 --> 00:08:08.600
because of course it's about weight of evidence.

115
00:08:08.601 --> 00:08:12.860
So this is all these groups,
which is the Met Office.
It's Noah,

116
00:08:12.861 --> 00:08:16.760
it's NASA have put all these together in different ways.

117
00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:17.990
And as you can see,

118
00:08:18.050 --> 00:08:23.050
strong warming of about one degree over the last hundred and 50 years.

119
00:08:23.810 --> 00:08:28.550
Okay?
2016 I had to change this slide because hey,

120
00:08:28.551 --> 00:08:31.490
what's 2015 was the warmest year on record.
Now it's 2016.

121
00:08:31.610 --> 00:08:35.110
There is a pattern occurring over the last 10 years of my slides.
Um,

122
00:08:35.210 --> 00:08:37.790
it's always last year,
which was the warmest,

123
00:08:38.150 --> 00:08:41.330
this is the summary geographically or fat as you can see,

124
00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:44.730
intense warming over the Amazonia,
uh,

125
00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:49.780
North Africa and in the High Arctic of more than two degrees,

126
00:08:51.470 --> 00:08:52.430
but that's just temperature.

127
00:08:53.110 --> 00:08:55.890
Are there any other things that are going to tell us that this really happening?

128
00:08:55.950 --> 00:09:00.540
Well,
you know,
I mentioned skiing and off.
See all like skiing.

129
00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:01.621
Yeah.
Okay.

130
00:09:01.621 --> 00:09:05.910
So northern hemisphere snow cover since 1980 has been dropping markedly.

131
00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:08.650
Oops.
A CIS ice,

132
00:09:08.770 --> 00:09:12.300
which of course the BBC love because Richard have a bun.

133
00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:16.500
Loves to go up there and go,
look,
it's melting.
It's like,
yet it's summer.
Um,

134
00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:19.830
they were okay.
Any excuse to get up to the Arctic.

135
00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:22.080
And this is the most worrying one.

136
00:09:22.770 --> 00:09:25.140
This is the heat content of the ocean.

137
00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:28.470
Unlike the atmosphere that warms up and cools down very rapidly.

138
00:09:28.650 --> 00:09:33.650
The ocean has a huge heat inertia and that's literally just going up and sea

139
00:09:34.621 --> 00:09:37.230
level wise as you can see,
steadily increasing.

140
00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:42.860
And the only good thing about sea level rise is that it is on the order of three

141
00:09:43.291 --> 00:09:47.730
to four millimeters per year.
So it's not suddenly going to catch us out,

142
00:09:48.090 --> 00:09:52.740
but we do need to plan.
If it starts to accelerate,

143
00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:56.580
it might go up to nine millimeters per year.
That may not sound a lot,

144
00:09:56.581 --> 00:10:00.600
but over a decade that makes a big difference to flood defenses and things like

145
00:10:00.601 --> 00:10:03.300
that.
So that's great.

146
00:10:03.301 --> 00:10:07.680
So the past seems to say we are having climate change and we know from lab

147
00:10:07.681 --> 00:10:11.880
experiments and atmosphere experiments that greenhouse gases do absorb heat.

148
00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:16.740
So how do we predict the future?
I mean this is the ridiculous stage.

149
00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:21.740
We've got two whereby we expect scientists such as myself to be able to go in

150
00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:26.460
the future.
I see.
So these are the models.

151
00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:32.030
These are the models that basically gritted system has air atmosphere as the

152
00:10:32.701 --> 00:10:37.620
ocean has land and they all interact with thermodynamics.
Okay.

153
00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:42.570
We know all the equations or movement and motion.
We can do it quite well.

154
00:10:43.170 --> 00:10:48.170
And the reason why you are here at Google is because of this huge increase in

155
00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:51.870
computer power.
So this is the first assessment reports,

156
00:10:51.871 --> 00:10:56.550
which was back in 1990 and yes,
Britain really was part of Europe.

157
00:10:57.060 --> 00:11:00.840
Okay.
Physically.
Okay.
Second one 95,

158
00:11:00.841 --> 00:11:04.040
got a better improvement.
We then got to sort of,
uh,

159
00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:06.060
the third one and the fourth one.

160
00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:08.760
And as you can see now we're down to the fifth one.

161
00:11:08.761 --> 00:11:12.930
We were about a hundred kilometer square for the resolution of these models.

162
00:11:14.250 --> 00:11:18.510
That's because of the huge increase in computer power that we can now access.

163
00:11:19.170 --> 00:11:23.610
The really scary thing though is actually,
um,
yeah,
the results haven't changed.

164
00:11:24.210 --> 00:11:26.220
We've been,
we've put more things in,

165
00:11:26.250 --> 00:11:30.720
we've added more subsections of the climate system and it still tells us the

166
00:11:30.721 --> 00:11:34.770
same thing,
right?
So what does that tell us?
So

167
00:11:36.510 --> 00:11:38.730
the problem is to predict the future,

168
00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.930
you have to predict you locked by you Lord,
not just you.

169
00:11:42.990 --> 00:11:47.850
I mean the whole world.
Okay.
So just people in general,
which is not that easy.

170
00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:51.660
So what scientists do is they get to gray it,

171
00:11:51.661 --> 00:11:55.150
gather a group of the great and the good economists because they know what

172
00:11:55.151 --> 00:11:58.240
happens in the future and social scientists.
And then save white,

173
00:11:58.330 --> 00:12:01.240
tell us stories or sorry,

174
00:12:01.241 --> 00:12:05.770
technically scenarios for what the future would look like.
So this one here,

175
00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:10.020
this is the business as usual.
Okay.
Uh,

176
00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:12.910
I used to call that the George Bush model and now we're going to have to call it

177
00:12:12.911 --> 00:12:14.700
the Trump model.
Okay.
Um,

178
00:12:14.830 --> 00:12:18.910
which is we keep burning fossil fuels at the same rate as we're doing now and we

179
00:12:18.911 --> 00:12:22.450
get to about four to six degrees by the end of the century.

180
00:12:22.870 --> 00:12:26.140
Now this one is the most interesting one.
This blue one.

181
00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:30.340
So this blue one is political.

182
00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:35.880
So the complete failure of the negotiations in Copenhagen in 2009,

183
00:12:36.970 --> 00:12:39.250
the politicians went away with one thing,

184
00:12:39.251 --> 00:12:43.180
which was at least we agreed a two degree target.
It was like,

185
00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:48.250
yeah,
why not 2.1,
why not nine point a 1.9?

186
00:12:49.090 --> 00:12:49.331
Yeah.

187
00:12:49.331 --> 00:12:52.900
Cause it sounded nice around and there was some sort of science underneath it.

188
00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:54.910
Okay.
Yeah.
Not much.
Okay.

189
00:12:55.030 --> 00:12:57.970
Particularly if you happen to be a low lying island state,

190
00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:02.620
two degrees means your country will be flooded.
Okay.
But they agreed to degree.

191
00:13:02.621 --> 00:13:04.240
So let's say to the scientist,
right?
Okay guys,

192
00:13:04.450 --> 00:13:09.450
we need you to have a two degree scenario.

193
00:13:09.730 --> 00:13:14.560
Show us what we need to do to make the world better.
Okay?

194
00:13:14.950 --> 00:13:18.550
So this is this blue one,
I guess what the models if fed the whites,

195
00:13:18.570 --> 00:13:21.250
a scenario guests,
what we keep it to two degrees.

196
00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:25.300
Now I'm going to reveal to you what that means.

197
00:13:25.870 --> 00:13:29.590
So the wonderful quote is limiting carbon emissions.

198
00:13:29.591 --> 00:13:34.591
We've acquired substained and substantial effort that 2015 Paris agreement shows

199
00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:39.580
you have to do this.
So that's your business as usual.

200
00:13:40.750 --> 00:13:44.710
This is the emissions if we're going to actually keep it.

201
00:13:44.740 --> 00:13:49.740
Now there are two major problems without the first one is by 2020 which I

202
00:13:50.411 --> 00:13:52.000
believe he's only in three years time.

203
00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:57.120
We have to start to cut global emissions by 3% per year,

204
00:13:59.020 --> 00:14:01.090
which is more than we've been growing it.
Okay?

205
00:14:01.450 --> 00:14:05.560
So we have to completely reverse the all tanker.
Good analogy.

206
00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:10.570
And by 2017 and this is something that scientists don't tell you.
Yeah.

207
00:14:10.571 --> 00:14:15.390
By 2017 we are have to have negative emissions.
Okay,
so let,

208
00:14:15.391 --> 00:14:16.510
let's,
let's proceed that.

209
00:14:16.511 --> 00:14:20.680
So that means the whole world does not emit any carbon or if it does,

210
00:14:20.710 --> 00:14:24.280
it sneakily sucks it back in to their country somehow.

211
00:14:24.580 --> 00:14:27.910
And then on top of that to make sure we hit the two degree target,

212
00:14:28.060 --> 00:14:32.320
we have to suck out even more.
Okay.
Hmm.
So,

213
00:14:32.950 --> 00:14:37.690
so that's the Paris to clean.
That is what all countries have signed up for.
Okay.

214
00:14:37.691 --> 00:14:42.340
And I'll show you a bit later why even Obama didn't know how to actually do this

215
00:14:42.341 --> 00:14:44.410
for the u s okay.
Right?

216
00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:50.680
So why is climate change so insidious and problematic?

217
00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:52.630
Because again,
less best thing about it,

218
00:14:53.190 --> 00:14:55.580
if it gets about two degrees warmer than average in London,

219
00:14:55.630 --> 00:14:59.180
are we really going to complain if gets about three or four degrees warmer than

220
00:14:59.181 --> 00:15:01.760
the south coast of England,
that'd be quite good.
You know,

221
00:15:02.150 --> 00:15:06.890
we could have the English river ever actually being like from southern France,

222
00:15:07.130 --> 00:15:10.700
we can grow beautiful wine,
et Cetera.
Well,

223
00:15:10.701 --> 00:15:14.450
the problem is that if you have climate change,

224
00:15:14.451 --> 00:15:16.580
and by the way you have to squint a bit,
okay.

225
00:15:16.581 --> 00:15:20.300
Or have lots of caffeine like I've had,
um,
there is climate change in there.

226
00:15:20.301 --> 00:15:24.050
So I put the average up.
So this could be,

227
00:15:24.051 --> 00:15:26.690
this could be rainfall,
this could be heat.

228
00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:29.120
It doesn't matter whichever one you want,
you can pick.

229
00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:34.600
Now the interesting thing is that every society has a coping range.

230
00:15:35.390 --> 00:15:38.120
Okay.
I'll give you an example of London.

231
00:15:38.510 --> 00:15:43.510
London's temperature coping range is zero degrees below zero.

232
00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:49.850
It starts to fail.
And if there's that sort of our come in,
what is called,

233
00:15:49.851 --> 00:15:54.650
it's white and fluffy.
Oh yeah,
snow.
Uh,

234
00:15:55.430 --> 00:15:59.670
if you have snow,
the Tube trains refused to come out of this.
I'm not coming.

235
00:15:59.671 --> 00:16:01.460
You know,
there's white stuff out there.
Okay.

236
00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:07.600
Compare that with Toronto where,
yeah,
two meters.
Yeah.
Now we're having a,

237
00:16:07.610 --> 00:16:10.850
a bit tough.
Okay.
And that's just in autumn.
Okay.
So again,

238
00:16:10.851 --> 00:16:15.851
different coping range and the upper range people start dying of heat related

239
00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:23.440
illnesses in London at 26 and a half degrees,

240
00:16:23.990 --> 00:16:28.430
that's a cold sauna.
Okay.
26 and a half.
Now in Athens,

241
00:16:29.270 --> 00:16:33.770
it's 28 and a half degrees.
Okay.
So there are these built in things.

242
00:16:34.010 --> 00:16:36.440
So if you don't change that,

243
00:16:38.090 --> 00:16:40.640
this is what happens.
So again,

244
00:16:41.810 --> 00:16:45.980
occasionally you have a flood or heat wave that goes beyond your coping range.

245
00:16:46.490 --> 00:16:47.360
Okay?
That will happen.

246
00:16:47.690 --> 00:16:50.630
But if you don't move the coping range or the infrastructure,

247
00:16:50.930 --> 00:16:52.340
you get more of these events.

248
00:16:53.060 --> 00:16:57.920
So just cause I thought I'll stick with your hometown.
So they are,

249
00:16:58.100 --> 00:17:00.460
uh,
you're the big yellow dot.
Okay.
That's Google.
Um,

250
00:17:00.461 --> 00:17:02.600
I couldn't make any smaller ones here.
Okay.
So they are,

251
00:17:02.601 --> 00:17:05.630
Google has taken over most of candle.
Um,

252
00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:11.560
so this is the picture of the temperature nominally at night in the heat wave in

253
00:17:13.371 --> 00:17:16.400
2003.
Okay.
Uh,

254
00:17:16.430 --> 00:17:19.790
this is why all the rich people live in Richmond.
Oh,
upon Thames.
Okay.

255
00:17:20.090 --> 00:17:22.910
Including my CEO.
Right.
So

256
00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:29.630
if we have a look,
the temperatures peaked both in July.

257
00:17:29.990 --> 00:17:30.590
Uh,

258
00:17:30.590 --> 00:17:35.590
then an early August we had the first recorded hundred degree Fahrenheit

259
00:17:36.711 --> 00:17:41.540
temperature in England.
Yes.
So my texts and friends said,
oh,
spring,

260
00:17:42.350 --> 00:17:46.290
my African friends went most of the year.
And why?

261
00:17:46.820 --> 00:17:50.010
So why is this special?
But if look at the blue,

262
00:17:50.430 --> 00:17:52.590
this blue dotted line is the death rate.

263
00:17:53.100 --> 00:17:55.770
This is the increase in death rate.

264
00:17:56.520 --> 00:18:00.000
The estimation is that through northern Europe,

265
00:18:00.570 --> 00:18:05.570
35 to 70,000 people died of heat related complications due to the,

266
00:18:07.531 --> 00:18:10.200
his heatwave.
Okay.
Now,

267
00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:14.580
and I love the medics cause it's not,
you know,
it's not children.

268
00:18:14.581 --> 00:18:17.520
It's not young people that are most vulnerable.
It's old people.

269
00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:21.000
And not during the day is when they go to sleep.

270
00:18:21.660 --> 00:18:25.260
They can't air rate themselves,
they can't hydrate themselves.

271
00:18:25.410 --> 00:18:27.240
And that's when the complications kick it.

272
00:18:27.630 --> 00:18:30.600
So what does the medics call this harvesting?

273
00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:34.910
Because these poor people were going to die sometime near the future,
you know,

274
00:18:35.010 --> 00:18:39.360
maybe five,
10,
15 years and they're just being taken a bit early due to the heat.

275
00:18:39.990 --> 00:18:40.201
Now,

276
00:18:40.201 --> 00:18:45.060
why doesn't this happen in let's say Texas every single summer?

277
00:18:45.780 --> 00:18:48.540
Well,
cause they all have air conditioning.
Now.

278
00:18:48.570 --> 00:18:50.650
We don't have air conditioning in most,
uh,

279
00:18:50.700 --> 00:18:54.780
or people's homes and we certainly don't have it in people,
old people's homes.

280
00:18:54.781 --> 00:18:59.100
Okay.
So again,
it's an adaptation and just to really,

281
00:18:59.630 --> 00:19:00.120
uh,

282
00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:03.900
make you pleased that you're in a nice air conditioned office here and you might

283
00:19:03.901 --> 00:19:05.640
want to have a look at your home.
Um,

284
00:19:05.790 --> 00:19:10.290
so this is the anomaly for 2003.

285
00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:14.460
These are the model to temperatures for a northern Europe.

286
00:19:14.970 --> 00:19:19.970
And so by 2014 that summer will be the average temperature for London.

287
00:19:22.830 --> 00:19:24.240
So we better adapt.

288
00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:29.300
And of course you still have extreme events of up to four degrees above that

289
00:19:29.401 --> 00:19:30.360
baseline.
Okay.

290
00:19:30.361 --> 00:19:33.420
Just because you've moved to baseline doesn't mean you don't get extreme events.

291
00:19:33.780 --> 00:19:38.070
So we need to move out infrastructure.
So

292
00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:42.540
Ooh,
sorry I had to do that.
Right.
Um,

293
00:19:42.541 --> 00:19:44.730
so what are the main effects of climate change?

294
00:19:44.731 --> 00:19:49.410
Cause I'm then going to go onto a bit of population and a bit of development.

295
00:19:49.650 --> 00:19:52.290
So the first thing is more extreme floods,

296
00:19:52.410 --> 00:19:57.410
droughts and heat waves and storms also in places that they haven't previously

297
00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:00.353
been.

298
00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:04.620
Cause when you heat up the planet you're actually expanding the climate zones.

299
00:20:04.770 --> 00:20:09.770
So therefore you're moving climate zones into new areas that haven't previously

300
00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:11.790
got these events

301
00:20:13.650 --> 00:20:16.010
may lead to food and water insecurity.

302
00:20:16.020 --> 00:20:20.070
One of the things about the Lancet report that we found was when we sat down

303
00:20:20.071 --> 00:20:22.800
over two years with the great and the good at Ucl,

304
00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:26.310
we realized that it wasn't doctors,
it wasn't the hospitals.

305
00:20:26.580 --> 00:20:31.530
Actually the greatest threat to human health in the future is just access to

306
00:20:31.531 --> 00:20:34.770
water.
And food.
Okay.
Once you've got that,

307
00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:36.570
you can then build everything else onto him.

308
00:20:38.340 --> 00:20:42.780
And the last one in which everybody talks about may lead to migration and

309
00:20:42.781 --> 00:20:47.350
conflict.
I will flag up here that people do not like to move.
Okay?

310
00:20:47.710 --> 00:20:51.610
People do not move unless they have to.
And with conflict,

311
00:20:51.940 --> 00:20:56.940
the UN did a review of all the water dispute international water disputes in,

312
00:20:57.500 --> 00:20:58.030
uh,

313
00:20:58.030 --> 00:21:03.030
the world and they found that nearly 85% of those ended with a negotiated

314
00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:06.850
treaty.
And we're peaceful.

315
00:21:07.750 --> 00:21:12.130
Only 15% of those ended up in some sort of conflict.
And the UN's,

316
00:21:12.460 --> 00:21:16.480
uh,
summary of this is the climate change doesn't cause conflict,

317
00:21:16.810 --> 00:21:19.750
but if you want to really good excuse to having a conflict,

318
00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:24.040
then water resources and things like that are very good excuse.
Okay?

319
00:21:24.670 --> 00:21:25.503
So

320
00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:29.950
it's this all because we've just got too many people on the planet.

321
00:21:29.951 --> 00:21:34.570
Please do not take this advice.
And as I always point out,
um,
please less,

322
00:21:34.571 --> 00:21:37.240
less not go back to the fashion.
Okay?
Okay.

323
00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:41.380
So is it just because we've got too many people?
I mean,
I read the Daily Mail,

324
00:21:41.470 --> 00:21:44.380
it tells me that there were loads of poor people out in the rest of the world.

325
00:21:44.500 --> 00:21:48.910
Uh,
just making it worse for us.
Okay.
So how does population work?

326
00:21:49.750 --> 00:21:53.170
So we have what's called the demographic transition.

327
00:21:53.860 --> 00:21:58.150
So we start off with a traditional,
uh,
uh,

328
00:21:58.330 --> 00:22:02.980
societies where you have high mortality rate.

329
00:22:02.981 --> 00:22:07.120
So a large number of babies and mothers die,
um,

330
00:22:07.180 --> 00:22:11.950
and therefore you have high fertility to match that out.
Okay?

331
00:22:11.951 --> 00:22:16.951
So you may have eight babies per mother and two of them make it to adulthood.

332
00:22:18.100 --> 00:22:19.480
Okay?
Now,
interestingly,

333
00:22:19.481 --> 00:22:23.980
you need to point to in a society to have replacement,
okay?

334
00:22:24.250 --> 00:22:26.380
So make sure that you keep the population stable.

335
00:22:26.620 --> 00:22:30.430
So you have very low population growth in the fifties,

336
00:22:31.370 --> 00:22:36.370
due to the huge acceleration of society and capitalism,

337
00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:40.300
we then had huge changes in medicine.

338
00:22:40.690 --> 00:22:45.610
Most of the major diseases were vaccinated against or preventable.
Okay?

339
00:22:45.910 --> 00:22:49.570
Amazing.
So what happened is mortality rate crashed.
Okay?

340
00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:51.550
So therefore low mortality,

341
00:22:52.030 --> 00:22:56.410
but society still had high fertility,
huge population.

342
00:22:57.130 --> 00:22:59.890
You then have women's education and empowerment.

343
00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:04.360
Forget anybody that tells you it's about,
uh,
contraception.

344
00:23:04.570 --> 00:23:09.130
We in this country and northern Europe went through the demographic transition

345
00:23:09.310 --> 00:23:13.480
during the Victorian period with no pill and trust me,

346
00:23:13.630 --> 00:23:16.780
you really wouldn't want the condoms of those days because there are only for

347
00:23:16.781 --> 00:23:20.590
the rich and they're made out of,
I believe it was sheeps.
Bladder.
Okay.

348
00:23:21.700 --> 00:23:25.870
Right?
So we can do this and what the key is,

349
00:23:26.050 --> 00:23:30.850
women's education up to secondary school level.
Okay?
Now I,

350
00:23:30.851 --> 00:23:32.560
when I teach this to my students,

351
00:23:32.561 --> 00:23:35.320
I have to look at the guys and apologize to them because they all think they're

352
00:23:35.321 --> 00:23:38.680
in control,
okay?
They think they think they're in control.

353
00:23:38.681 --> 00:23:42.610
Lots of things off their fertility.
How many children getting,
yeah,
no.

354
00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:44.020
You know how to tell you this.

355
00:23:44.021 --> 00:23:49.021
It is women who are in control once they understand their fertility.

356
00:23:49.910 --> 00:23:50.450
Okay?

357
00:23:50.450 --> 00:23:55.450
So all of this went horribly wrong in the 1960s and we had 2% growth in

358
00:23:57.231 --> 00:23:59.060
population during that period of time.

359
00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:04.520
We are now below 1% and we're going to drop by the end of the century to a

360
00:24:05.511 --> 00:24:07.880
negative.
We're going to have some shrinkage.

361
00:24:09.260 --> 00:24:14.260
So the world population is expected to hit about nine and a bit billion by the

362
00:24:16.790 --> 00:24:20.450
middle of the century.
Okay.
We're at 7.4 now.
Okay.

363
00:24:20.690 --> 00:24:25.690
So that is still an extra 2 billion people that we have to figure into our

364
00:24:27.021 --> 00:24:31.490
society and how to actually feed them.
Now,

365
00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:34.520
big problem here is that

366
00:24:36.620 --> 00:24:40.940
up to very recently,
family planning was not on the international agenda.

367
00:24:41.870 --> 00:24:46.870
Then Obama came in and the first thing he did was remove the gag law form all US

368
00:24:49.191 --> 00:24:53.660
funding.
So that UN funding could be for family planning.

369
00:24:54.740 --> 00:24:57.620
Trump,
I think it was day two.
Okay.

370
00:24:58.220 --> 00:25:02.030
I think he was mucking up the CIA on the day one,
but day two,

371
00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:06.350
first thing he did was put the gag law back and now it's even tougher,

372
00:25:06.351 --> 00:25:11.351
which is any agency in the UN who even mentions family planning because family

373
00:25:13.131 --> 00:25:17.690
planning in their eyes means abortion.
Um,
unfortunately won't get any US funding.

374
00:25:17.930 --> 00:25:19.850
Okay.
So we're now back.

375
00:25:20.690 --> 00:25:25.690
But the key thing is family planning is not about abortion sterilization or

376
00:25:26.071 --> 00:25:26.870
contraception.

377
00:25:26.870 --> 00:25:31.280
It is mainly about women's empowerment and women's education.

378
00:25:32.150 --> 00:25:35.450
So now I've cheered you up.
Sorry.
Um,
so,
okay,

379
00:25:35.451 --> 00:25:38.330
so we're going to have 10 billion people by the middle of the century.
Uh,

380
00:25:38.331 --> 00:25:42.290
we've got rapid development and we could have temperature changes of over four

381
00:25:42.291 --> 00:25:45.530
degrees,
but still haven't answered the question.

382
00:25:45.770 --> 00:25:47.720
Is it because we all have those poor people,
you know,

383
00:25:47.721 --> 00:25:49.310
those countries that aren't developed,

384
00:25:49.580 --> 00:25:54.260
it's cause they're all those people causing all this pollution?
No,

385
00:25:54.980 --> 00:25:57.290
it is because of consumption.
Okay.

386
00:25:57.291 --> 00:26:02.291
So this is the total per capita emissions for different countries.

387
00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:07.820
So we see,
hear us if we happen to be in Google in California,
yeah,

388
00:26:07.821 --> 00:26:12.470
we will be.
Yeah.
Each of us 19 tons of carbon per person per year.

389
00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:15.170
Okay.
Uh,
just by moving to London,

390
00:26:15.350 --> 00:26:20.350
actually you only pollute by eight tons of carbon per person per year.

391
00:26:20.780 --> 00:26:21.613
Okay.

392
00:26:21.890 --> 00:26:25.790
And of course these are the protections for 2030,

393
00:26:25.791 --> 00:26:30.791
so America is coming down Europe with all the strict regulation is coming down,

394
00:26:31.671 --> 00:26:36.080
but of course UK may be leaving.
So that will go up again.
Uh,
China,
Brazil,

395
00:26:36.081 --> 00:26:40.070
and India,
you know,
that two degree target I showed you.

396
00:26:40.071 --> 00:26:44.010
And that wonderful curve to do that fairly

397
00:26:45.540 --> 00:26:47.310
all countries have to be on the red line,

398
00:26:47.311 --> 00:26:51.120
which is two tons of carbon per person per year.

399
00:26:51.570 --> 00:26:56.570
Now just imagine you are a bomber with 19 tons per person per year and you're

400
00:26:57.841 --> 00:27:00.180
looking at climate change as one of the serious things.

401
00:27:01.590 --> 00:27:06.590
You now know how difficult it is to actually deal with climate change in a

402
00:27:07.621 --> 00:27:11.040
political sense.
Okay.
So let's get political.

403
00:27:11.940 --> 00:27:14.690
Perhaps it's just lack of money.
Okay.
You know,

404
00:27:14.700 --> 00:27:18.180
perhaps we're just too poor to deal with this.
Okay.
Yeah,
I guess.
Well,

405
00:27:19.620 --> 00:27:22.760
yeah,
that's GDP growth,
uh,
for the world.
Admittedly,

406
00:27:22.770 --> 00:27:25.980
I did start it in the 16th and 17th century,
but you know,

407
00:27:26.310 --> 00:27:29.520
it just literally is a straight up line.
And as you're here,

408
00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:31.950
I thought I'd tell you.
So you,
UK,

409
00:27:31.980 --> 00:27:36.980
d a GDP growth was two point $9 trillion last year.

410
00:27:40.110 --> 00:27:43.680
That's how much money we made last year as a country.

411
00:27:44.730 --> 00:27:46.770
So why do we have poor people?
Okay,

412
00:27:48.030 --> 00:27:52.020
so I'm a geographer,
so therefore,
I'm sorry,
you could have a map.

413
00:27:52.050 --> 00:27:55.410
So this is,
uh,
this is where the people are.

414
00:27:57.120 --> 00:27:57.953
This is the money,

415
00:27:58.740 --> 00:28:03.740
this is the people money know really even I can't get a correlation between

416
00:28:04.411 --> 00:28:08.820
those two and I fudged a lot of things in my time.
Okay.
Right?
So this is,

417
00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:12.650
I love this.
This is from Oxfam.
So the first thing is,
uh,

418
00:28:12.660 --> 00:28:17.660
academic research has shown that the richest 1% of adults in 2014 owned 48% of

419
00:28:21.181 --> 00:28:24.210
the world resources.
By 2015,

420
00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:29.240
it was 50% bottom half owns less than 1% and

421
00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:38.010
in 2010,
that was the same as 388 billionaires.

422
00:28:38.011 --> 00:28:43.011
So 380 billionaires own the same as the bottom three and a half billion people.

423
00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:48.600
It drops,
it drops and drops.
And in 2015,
shockingly,

424
00:28:48.930 --> 00:28:53.370
it was 62 billionaires.
You had to get into a room about this site actually.
Yeah,

425
00:28:53.371 --> 00:28:56.190
that's about,
yeah,
about that.
But this size,

426
00:28:56.520 --> 00:29:01.520
those people own the same amount of wealth as 3.5 billion people.

427
00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:09.800
So they redo the calculation this year and now it's down to eight people.

428
00:29:10.920 --> 00:29:15.690
Okay.
Eight people own the wealth of the bottom half.

429
00:29:16.080 --> 00:29:19.380
And You wonder why we have problems dealing with issues.
Right?

430
00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:24.800
So not to leave you depressed and miserable going back to your work going,

431
00:29:26.611 --> 00:29:31.560
Oh,
why did we bother?
Okay.
Cause I feel that would be really mean.

432
00:29:31.620 --> 00:29:36.030
Okay.
Um,
have to deal with students.
Undergraduates,
they're very sensitive people.

433
00:29:36.180 --> 00:29:40.920
So solutions,
all the solutions exist.
Okay.

434
00:29:40.930 --> 00:29:44.770
This is the ridiculous thing about climate change.
It is just pollution.
Okay?

435
00:29:45.070 --> 00:29:47.380
All solutions exist.
We can deal with it.

436
00:29:47.410 --> 00:29:52.410
So 50% of all the energy requirements for the world have yet to be built.

437
00:29:54.040 --> 00:29:58.650
Okay?
Huge opportunity.
And therefore,
yeah.
Wind wave.

438
00:29:58.660 --> 00:30:03.610
Solar.
Yeah.
Fusion.
Hm.
Well,
if we actually invested in it properly,

439
00:30:03.611 --> 00:30:07.000
it might work,
but there are a couple of things stopping us.

440
00:30:07.980 --> 00:30:12.820
So renewables are competitive against fossil fuels.
Okay?

441
00:30:12.970 --> 00:30:15.460
Don't allow any economist to tell you they're not.

442
00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:20.410
The reason they're not is because of the global subsidies.

443
00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:23.140
So the International Monetary Fund,
you know,

444
00:30:23.141 --> 00:30:25.870
that well known left wing think tank,
um,

445
00:30:26.070 --> 00:30:31.070
suggest that the subsidies are about five point $3 trillion.

446
00:30:32.110 --> 00:30:36.040
Okay?
So that's twice the GDP of the United Kingdom.

447
00:30:36.190 --> 00:30:37.960
The fifth largest economy in the world,

448
00:30:38.410 --> 00:30:42.310
still just so why?

449
00:30:43.350 --> 00:30:47.470
But people think that fossil fuel companies are in the private sector.

450
00:30:47.870 --> 00:30:51.040
It not true the big 25,

451
00:30:51.041 --> 00:30:52.960
she was take the big 25 companies,

452
00:30:53.290 --> 00:30:58.290
19 of them are either part or fully state owned.

453
00:30:59.370 --> 00:31:01.240
Okay.
And therefore,

454
00:31:01.750 --> 00:31:05.310
if you have a company that's producing huge amounts of,
uh,

455
00:31:05.410 --> 00:31:08.510
petro dollars for your country,
you're going to get here.

456
00:31:09.100 --> 00:31:12.550
So tax some tax back.
Yeah,
of course you can do that.
Yeah.

457
00:31:12.551 --> 00:31:16.720
I'm not going to charge you anything.
Okay.
Again,
think about it.

458
00:31:16.840 --> 00:31:21.460
I love the fact that Norway wants to go carbon neutral in the future except to

459
00:31:21.461 --> 00:31:23.860
call stat oil,
which is owned by the Norwegian government,

460
00:31:24.040 --> 00:31:29.040
means that they have the largest sovereign wealth fund of any country in the

461
00:31:29.111 --> 00:31:33.160
world,
which is now about $250 billion.
Okay.

462
00:31:33.370 --> 00:31:38.020
I have no idea how to spend that on the 7 million people in their country.
Okay.

463
00:31:38.830 --> 00:31:40.690
So,
however,

464
00:31:40.691 --> 00:31:44.980
one of the big problems in developing a developed countries,
I apologize,

465
00:31:45.070 --> 00:31:48.790
is not for fossil fuels and it is transport.

466
00:31:48.910 --> 00:31:52.660
So in the UK building,
um,

467
00:31:53.500 --> 00:31:55.120
sort of,
uh,
energy,

468
00:31:55.210 --> 00:32:00.090
all of those are coming down slowly ratcheting down.
And I had to say,
look,

469
00:32:01.270 --> 00:32:06.040
really,
really do you Joe,
I really going to buy that car.
I'm sorry.
You know,

470
00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:11.160
so I'm here to say you don't have to push the whole global call.

471
00:32:11.651 --> 00:32:15.760
Okay.
Because look,
these are to supercars.
Okay.
So that,

472
00:32:15.761 --> 00:32:19.900
that's the for petrol.
Petrolheads starts the Porsche and that's the Mclaren's.

473
00:32:20.170 --> 00:32:21.003
Uh,

474
00:32:21.010 --> 00:32:26.010
they both suggests they can do not to 60 in 2.6 seconds than the Mclaren is 2.7

475
00:32:27.611 --> 00:32:30.010
seconds.
But we won't say that.
Okay,

476
00:32:30.360 --> 00:32:32.650
well German technology won't say anything about,

477
00:32:33.130 --> 00:32:36.370
but how do they do that with an electric engine?

478
00:32:36.700 --> 00:32:38.920
So these are hybrids,

479
00:32:39.050 --> 00:32:42.560
seven electric engine that basically generates huge amount of talk,

480
00:32:42.740 --> 00:32:45.020
takes them up to about 60 or 70 miles now.

481
00:32:45.260 --> 00:32:49.880
And then after that they go petrol,
which then takes you up to 200 plus.
Okay.

482
00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:54.560
So Tesla,
so again,

483
00:32:54.740 --> 00:32:57.530
the future is electric.
Okay.

484
00:32:57.531 --> 00:33:01.670
Because you can then generate all the electricity through green means and then

485
00:33:01.671 --> 00:33:06.380
feed.
So hopefully in the next 20 years,
every single car you'll see outside here,

486
00:33:06.560 --> 00:33:10.790
we'll have to be electric.
Okay?
By the way,
if you don't believe me,

487
00:33:11.060 --> 00:33:15.890
look at the warfare that goes on for parking spaces outside Harvey Nicks.

488
00:33:15.891 --> 00:33:16.400
Okay?

489
00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:21.400
You have expensive Teslas and smart cars fighting for parking spaces because

490
00:33:21.561 --> 00:33:24.160
electric cars get free parking spaces.

491
00:33:24.810 --> 00:33:29.750
It's all about manipulating little wars and society.
So I want to give you,

492
00:33:30.490 --> 00:33:34.310
Ooh,
oh,
that's okay.
There is a,

493
00:33:34.730 --> 00:33:39.350
there was a map here.
It's gone.
Never mind.
Um,
then you see that.
So

494
00:33:40.970 --> 00:33:45.970
the classic thing is that America is where we will win and lose the whole

495
00:33:46.731 --> 00:33:48.560
climate change agenda.
Okay?

496
00:33:48.800 --> 00:33:53.800
The reason being is because it produces second most Ma'am Sio two in the world

497
00:33:54.710 --> 00:33:57.020
and where America goes,
everybody else follows.

498
00:33:57.380 --> 00:34:00.290
So this is about high speed trains.
So at the moment,

499
00:34:00.680 --> 00:34:05.030
China is building 11,000 miles of high speed trains.

500
00:34:05.210 --> 00:34:10.210
Germany already has over a thousand miles and the u s has 456.

501
00:34:12.620 --> 00:34:17.620
So this is a beautiful study by America 2050,

502
00:34:17.990 --> 00:34:21.770
because you can get rid of almost all flights in the u s okay.
Overnight,

503
00:34:21.980 --> 00:34:23.930
if you build a high speed railways.

504
00:34:24.650 --> 00:34:29.150
And the thing is people assume that all the flights are from east to west and

505
00:34:29.151 --> 00:34:30.620
west to east.
Absolute rubbish.

506
00:34:30.980 --> 00:34:35.980
Most flights are within the small corridors up and down the coast to Chicago or

507
00:34:37.311 --> 00:34:40.250
up and down bits of California or the northwest.
Okay.

508
00:34:40.700 --> 00:34:43.490
Small hot flights that you don't need.
So again,

509
00:34:44.660 --> 00:34:49.660
you can build railways 360 miles per hour and you could quite happily

510
00:34:52.250 --> 00:34:56.120
remove 90% of all flights in the US.
Okay,

511
00:34:57.410 --> 00:35:02.180
brilliant solution.
Hey,
and guess what?
It will produce jobs.

512
00:35:03.010 --> 00:35:07.580
You would have to actually get the steel American steel companies up and running

513
00:35:07.581 --> 00:35:09.470
to produce all the railway lines,
et cetera.

514
00:35:09.770 --> 00:35:14.300
It's so beautifully ticks all the buttons except for Cole because they're not

515
00:35:14.301 --> 00:35:16.340
steam powered trains.
Right?

516
00:35:16.880 --> 00:35:19.760
So there are also market solutions.

517
00:35:19.761 --> 00:35:23.150
You don't have to just hope this happens.
So again,

518
00:35:23.180 --> 00:35:25.370
market solutions have been tried and tested.

519
00:35:26.900 --> 00:35:30.260
So for Co two,
there are a number of ways you can do it.

520
00:35:30.650 --> 00:35:33.090
The first one is that you,
uh,

521
00:35:33.620 --> 00:35:37.560
tax the actual polluter.
Oh,

522
00:35:37.680 --> 00:35:40.410
you give out permits.
So in Europe,

523
00:35:40.440 --> 00:35:45.330
what's interesting is there is the emissions trading scheme whereby companies

524
00:35:45.390 --> 00:35:46.710
have to trade permits.

525
00:35:47.190 --> 00:35:51.510
And this trading scheme was incredibly successful in the u s when they were

526
00:35:51.511 --> 00:35:54.450
trying to get rid of software,
dark side from power stations.

527
00:35:54.690 --> 00:35:56.550
And it was the clean air act.

528
00:35:57.150 --> 00:36:02.150
There were huge Christ that this was going to cost $8 billion to enact by

529
00:36:03.001 --> 00:36:03.990
trading.
Uh,

530
00:36:03.991 --> 00:36:07.920
meaning that the people that could clean up quickest and fastest and most

531
00:36:07.921 --> 00:36:12.600
efficient the deed first and customer billion dollars to clean up all of their

532
00:36:12.601 --> 00:36:15.120
power stations and stop acid rain.

533
00:36:16.170 --> 00:36:19.890
You can embed the cost in the actual item.

534
00:36:20.370 --> 00:36:22.620
So if you have a high carbon,
uh,
item,

535
00:36:22.770 --> 00:36:25.470
then it has an extra whack of dosh in there.

536
00:36:25.920 --> 00:36:30.210
And what you should do is then you pull all of that money back into the treasury

537
00:36:30.420 --> 00:36:35.420
and you give it back out to schemes that reduce CEO to simple economics.

538
00:36:37.320 --> 00:36:38.153
Okay?

539
00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:42.870
It means that you punish the people and the items that you don't want.

540
00:36:42.990 --> 00:36:47.460
You drive innovation because people suddenly find out a way to do it.
Oh,

541
00:36:47.461 --> 00:36:52.350
by the way,
if you want to make your fortune not just here at Google,

542
00:36:52.351 --> 00:36:53.820
okay?
He wants to make your fortune.

543
00:36:54.420 --> 00:36:58.290
If you can invent an additive for concrete,
okay?

544
00:36:58.500 --> 00:36:59.940
So at the moment concrete,

545
00:37:00.120 --> 00:37:05.070
you take all the bits and pieces and you put it into gas burners and you have to

546
00:37:05.071 --> 00:37:08.730
heat it up to 1,400 degrees Celsius,
okay?

547
00:37:09.030 --> 00:37:10.980
Which then makes an aggregate,
which makes concrete,

548
00:37:10.981 --> 00:37:13.440
which built almost a single building in the world.

549
00:37:14.610 --> 00:37:19.080
If you can get it down to heating it up only to 900 degrees with a magic

550
00:37:19.081 --> 00:37:21.600
ingredient,
guess what?
We can then use electricity.

551
00:37:21.990 --> 00:37:26.280
We can use heaters and therefore you wouldn't need all those gas burners.

552
00:37:26.740 --> 00:37:29.960
So Co because concrete is one of the biggest,
uh,

553
00:37:29.980 --> 00:37:34.860
CO2 emitters both by production and by,
uh,

554
00:37:34.870 --> 00:37:37.560
a movement around the country.
Okay?

555
00:37:37.890 --> 00:37:42.390
So if you have a great clan and you can sprinkle some magic dust in there,

556
00:37:42.450 --> 00:37:43.020
that's,

557
00:37:43.020 --> 00:37:47.490
so those are the sort of innovations we need to really draw the actual system

558
00:37:47.491 --> 00:37:52.440
down now.
So how do you embed this in?

559
00:37:52.441 --> 00:37:56.910
So of course there's these whole move now to progressive,
inclusive capitalism.

560
00:37:57.090 --> 00:38:01.530
Whether it was last year,
I'm not sure about this year.
So,
but the,

561
00:38:01.700 --> 00:38:06.150
the idea you have the triple bottom line.
So you have the economics.

562
00:38:06.180 --> 00:38:11.180
So you have to actually have companies which are a healthy initative that grow,

563
00:38:12.330 --> 00:38:15.510
employ more people.
But at the same time you,

564
00:38:15.570 --> 00:38:19.320
you and governments have to understand that you have to deal with the social to

565
00:38:19.321 --> 00:38:23.910
make sure that there are a supports for everybody and you then have to deal with

566
00:38:23.911 --> 00:38:27.630
the environment and make sure you actually can put all those together.

567
00:38:28.140 --> 00:38:31.770
Now the ridiculous thing is that if you look at post Second World War,

568
00:38:32.460 --> 00:38:37.000
it was realized by governments that markets work cause of the failure between

569
00:38:37.001 --> 00:38:37.834
the wars.

570
00:38:38.140 --> 00:38:43.140
So all governments interfered with the economics and international economics to

571
00:38:43.780 --> 00:38:48.780
help set exchange rates until the ATS where then that was removed through near

572
00:38:49.391 --> 00:38:50.224
liberalism.

573
00:38:50.440 --> 00:38:54.070
And the interesting thing is they call it progressive inclusive capitalism.

574
00:38:54.940 --> 00:38:58.450
Bizarrely enough as far as I can tell,
it's just social democracy.
Okay.

575
00:38:59.570 --> 00:39:01.330
Name a name for a new century.

576
00:39:02.290 --> 00:39:06.640
So I'm going to leave you with a couple of thoughts.

577
00:39:07.140 --> 00:39:12.140
It's a climate change is one of the major four issues of this century.

578
00:39:13.030 --> 00:39:18.030
But you cannot deal with climate change without dealing with the other four,

579
00:39:18.520 --> 00:39:23.320
the other three.
Okay.
You need to be able to win win solutions for all of it.

580
00:39:23.380 --> 00:39:25.490
Okay.
Well,

581
00:39:25.500 --> 00:39:30.500
so this is a wonderful cartoon by Joe Pat that came out in us today in 2009

582
00:39:32.860 --> 00:39:37.600
because this was just the great Copenhagen sort of a a conference.

583
00:39:37.600 --> 00:39:40.750
We're all going to love each other.
It was all going to be so much better.

584
00:39:41.020 --> 00:39:46.020
And actually interestingly a Bama mocked it up and the reason why he mucked it

585
00:39:46.271 --> 00:39:51.271
up was because the NSA was listening in and actually accessing everybody

586
00:39:52.211 --> 00:39:56.540
Dropbox.
So don't use Dropbox.
Um,
cause the NSA is listening and they basically,

587
00:39:56.541 --> 00:40:00.700
you took everybody's negotiation notes and the US knew exactly what everybody

588
00:40:00.701 --> 00:40:03.250
else was doing at Copenhagen.
Okay.

589
00:40:03.910 --> 00:40:07.240
Colleagues of mine spend our time with developing countries,

590
00:40:07.241 --> 00:40:11.140
telling them not to use Dropbox and certain other things and how to actually

591
00:40:11.141 --> 00:40:15.190
encrypt and make sure that they keep their negotiation stance a little bit more

592
00:40:15.191 --> 00:40:18.820
secret than Copenhagen.
But that's by the,
by.
Well,
I'm sorry,

593
00:40:18.830 --> 00:40:23.740
I just think we could,
if we deal with climate change happen,

594
00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:27.790
energy independence,
why should we be beholden on Russian gas,

595
00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:32.980
preserve the main foyer,
sustainability,
green jobs,
livable cities,
renewables,

596
00:40:33.190 --> 00:40:35.830
clean Walter air,
healthy children,
et cetera.

597
00:40:36.190 --> 00:40:38.260
And ass somebody says,

598
00:40:38.261 --> 00:40:43.261
what if it's a big hoax and we've created a better world for nothing.

599
00:40:44.080 --> 00:40:44.913
Thank you.

600
00:40:46.360 --> 00:40:49.210
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

601
00:40:52.870 --> 00:40:55.300
<v 2>thank you very much.
So we do have time for questions.</v>

602
00:40:55.930 --> 00:40:57.760
Please wait for the microphone.
Yup.

603
00:41:00.660 --> 00:41:03.920
<v 0>Um,
by the way,
feel free to ask any questions about climate change.</v>

604
00:41:03.921 --> 00:41:05.750
There are no stupid questions in climate change.

605
00:41:05.990 --> 00:41:10.880
<v 2>Yeah.
So I read the very interesting book.
It's called results.
What air probably,</v>

606
00:41:10.881 --> 00:41:11.121
you know,

607
00:41:11.121 --> 00:41:16.121
read by David McKay and basically make some calculations about what we actually

608
00:41:16.791 --> 00:41:20.660
need to do to say my Britain hundred percent renewables.

609
00:41:21.180 --> 00:41:24.170
And the short answer is very hard and you know,

610
00:41:25.520 --> 00:41:27.050
so I run,

611
00:41:27.051 --> 00:41:30.680
the one thing you didn't mention is nuclear energy.

612
00:41:30.681 --> 00:41:34.550
So what's your position on that?
Okay,
so

613
00:41:35.360 --> 00:41:36.470
<v 0>two questions in there.</v>

614
00:41:36.920 --> 00:41:41.750
Is it really hard to turn the whole of the UK into a Newell's?
Yes,
it is.

615
00:41:41.751 --> 00:41:46.520
Because you need 20% baseline that you can rely on.

616
00:41:46.610 --> 00:41:51.320
Okay.
So you can have 80% which is wind or solar,
which comes and goes,

617
00:41:51.321 --> 00:41:55.220
et cetera.
Hence why people are interested in title titles.

618
00:41:55.280 --> 00:41:58.370
Research is about 20 years behind wind.
Okay.

619
00:41:58.580 --> 00:42:01.520
So the problem is that it's not very well developed.

620
00:42:02.060 --> 00:42:04.500
You need that 20% because,
uh,

621
00:42:04.520 --> 00:42:08.960
when you lot are watching and the one I have to say,
um,
uh,
yeah,

622
00:42:08.990 --> 00:42:12.530
more like this one.
So I always,
for the students,
I always say,

623
00:42:12.531 --> 00:42:16.490
just think it's the World Cup final England are playing Germany.

624
00:42:16.760 --> 00:42:19.330
It's a fantasy,
but we're playing,
okay.
Uh,

625
00:42:19.670 --> 00:42:23.090
England one kneel down at half time on what do you do?

626
00:42:23.120 --> 00:42:24.860
Everybody goes and switches the catalog.

627
00:42:25.400 --> 00:42:30.400
So the national grid literally watches TV and has the radio times in front of

628
00:42:30.741 --> 00:42:35.741
them for when they had to switch on that base load to be able to cope with your

629
00:42:36.531 --> 00:42:41.510
huge demand when you need your beer,
cup of tea,
et Cetera,
at half time.

630
00:42:41.530 --> 00:42:46.510
Okay.
Or interesting enough,
as soon as strictly finishes.
Okay.

631
00:42:46.720 --> 00:42:50.420
That there are some major peaks in there.
So that's how they do.
So yes,

632
00:42:50.450 --> 00:42:54.680
it is difficult.
But at the moment we have a mixture,

633
00:42:54.681 --> 00:42:59.681
which means that from anything from about 15 up to 25% every day is already

634
00:43:00.891 --> 00:43:05.060
renewables.
Okay.
So we're starting to do that.
The nuclear question,

635
00:43:05.240 --> 00:43:07.130
the new question is problematic.

636
00:43:07.490 --> 00:43:12.490
So I always take a nice sidestep and say if you live in a democracy,

637
00:43:14.030 --> 00:43:18.800
then your democracy has to decide whether the risks are worth taking.

638
00:43:19.190 --> 00:43:22.340
Okay.
There are two things to remember about nuclear.

639
00:43:22.550 --> 00:43:26.270
It is relatively carbon free when it's producing,

640
00:43:27.140 --> 00:43:31.250
but remember it is one of the largest balls of concrete ever constructed.

641
00:43:31.790 --> 00:43:35.570
You also have to ship the uranium unless you have a fast breeder and then you

642
00:43:35.571 --> 00:43:38.420
even more worried,
um,
from other countries.

643
00:43:38.630 --> 00:43:43.630
And also we have no idea what the carbon footprint of storing the material for

644
00:43:44.301 --> 00:43:46.130
the next 10,000 years.
Okay.

645
00:43:46.370 --> 00:43:49.160
So you can play with your carbon footprint or nuclear,

646
00:43:49.161 --> 00:43:51.890
however you like to make it nice or not nice.

647
00:43:52.340 --> 00:43:55.820
But my answer is usually it's democracies that decide.

648
00:43:55.821 --> 00:43:59.390
So in Germany they had decided that that is not the route they want to go down.

649
00:44:00.080 --> 00:44:01.560
Whereas in France they went,
yeah.

650
00:44:03.080 --> 00:44:07.370
And basically they have a major problem which is they have to now work out how

651
00:44:07.371 --> 00:44:12.371
to afford new nuclear power plants because about 80% of their fuel comes,

652
00:44:13.100 --> 00:44:17.420
uh,
energy comes from nuclear.
That was a wonderful getter.
Next question.

653
00:44:19.340 --> 00:44:20.173
<v 3>Yup.</v>

654
00:44:24.770 --> 00:44:28.640
<v 4>So I read an article some days ago about CEO not veen CO2,
sorry,
uh,</v>

655
00:44:28.730 --> 00:44:32.160
not being the real measure of we impact um,

656
00:44:32.210 --> 00:44:34.410
<v 5>uh,
global warming and you said something about it.</v>

657
00:44:34.411 --> 00:44:38.710
So is there any other variable that we can somehow measure and see,
um,

658
00:44:39.300 --> 00:44:41.410
that is causing global warming?
That is not CEO too.

659
00:44:41.930 --> 00:44:46.230
<v 0>Right.
Okay.
So you will see that there are different measures.</v>

660
00:44:46.650 --> 00:44:49.110
So there is how much chu is in the atmosphere,

661
00:44:49.320 --> 00:44:52.890
which is actually a pretty good measure cause it is the major greenhouse gas.

662
00:44:53.130 --> 00:44:56.220
Okay.
In the models when you see that there is,

663
00:44:56.280 --> 00:44:59.160
let's say there's four degrees warming the models,

664
00:44:59.161 --> 00:45:03.600
we're all agreed that only half of that is direct warming form CO2,

665
00:45:03.601 --> 00:45:07.440
methane and the other pollutant greenhouse gases.

666
00:45:07.710 --> 00:45:12.660
The other half is form water vapor because there's a positive feedback about

667
00:45:12.660 --> 00:45:16.110
half the warming we get in all the models is because as we heat up the planet,

668
00:45:16.420 --> 00:45:18.330
more moisture in the atmosphere that heats up.

669
00:45:18.360 --> 00:45:22.800
So those are the little wonderful models within models that we run.

670
00:45:23.040 --> 00:45:23.873
So that's,

671
00:45:24.450 --> 00:45:28.950
that's that bit second bay is there are other ways of actually putting all the

672
00:45:28.951 --> 00:45:33.390
greenhouse gases together,
but not water vapor called CO2 equivalent.

673
00:45:34.260 --> 00:45:38.400
And so what they do is they take methane CFCs,

674
00:45:38.430 --> 00:45:41.460
nitrous oxides,
and they work out the warming potential.

675
00:45:41.820 --> 00:45:46.820
So every methane is 21 times more powerful than CO2 at holding heat.

676
00:45:48.600 --> 00:45:49.980
Luckily it's only in the billions,

677
00:45:49.981 --> 00:45:53.190
whereas [inaudible] is in the millions and then you add them all up and that

678
00:45:53.191 --> 00:45:57.120
gives you a total greenhouse loading.
That helps.

679
00:45:57.390 --> 00:46:00.540
So the problem is there,
Nicole scientists don't tell that to people.

680
00:46:00.541 --> 00:46:04.740
So whether you're talking about CO2 or co two equivalents and the other one

681
00:46:04.741 --> 00:46:09.060
that's also naughty as people caught talk about carbon tonic,

682
00:46:09.900 --> 00:46:14.730
which of course the amount of carbon in the atmosphere in tons is different from

683
00:46:14.731 --> 00:46:17.760
the amount of Sia too.
Because of course you've got two oxygens.
Okay.

684
00:46:17.761 --> 00:46:19.200
So there are lots of different measures,

685
00:46:19.201 --> 00:46:21.980
but you can quite happily move between them.
Um,

686
00:46:22.140 --> 00:46:25.300
and actually the end of the day it's all going up and it's all going to hell.

687
00:46:26.350 --> 00:46:28.170
So no,
it was different.

688
00:46:29.690 --> 00:46:32.720
<v 5>And so I have a question.
Um,
so,
uh,</v>

689
00:46:32.810 --> 00:46:37.810
so the unfortunately still people who think that climate change is either not

690
00:46:38.211 --> 00:46:42.860
influenced by humans at all or,
uh,
a complete fabrication.

691
00:46:43.620 --> 00:46:46.520
Uh,
do you talk to these people and some of them might even policy makers.

692
00:46:46.521 --> 00:46:49.820
So you talked to these people and how do you talk to me?

693
00:46:50.520 --> 00:46:54.270
<v 0>So,
um,
there is a group of skeptics.</v>

694
00:46:54.420 --> 00:46:57.810
They're becoming much older and shrinking in number.
Um,

695
00:46:57.811 --> 00:47:02.070
so the first book that I wrote,
so the,
the version you have,

696
00:47:02.071 --> 00:47:05.700
the red one a is actually a edition three.

697
00:47:06.140 --> 00:47:09.120
And the weird thing is I've had to rewrite the book because so much changes in

698
00:47:09.121 --> 00:47:09.661
climate change.

699
00:47:09.661 --> 00:47:14.520
So the first one came out in 2004 and it was written because there was so many

700
00:47:14.521 --> 00:47:18.810
questions that normal people had about climate change and things about the

701
00:47:18.811 --> 00:47:21.540
history of it,
of how the politics.
So I put that all together.

702
00:47:22.680 --> 00:47:27.180
A lot of us engage constantly with the public,
the media.

703
00:47:27.360 --> 00:47:29.650
And there is a,
I would say there was a,

704
00:47:30.150 --> 00:47:35.150
a small cabal of about 20 scientists in the UK that regularly engaged to try to

705
00:47:36.610 --> 00:47:41.500
block or counter,
uh,
ridiculous statements from the skeptics.

706
00:47:41.560 --> 00:47:45.640
Um,
uh,
again,
I perhaps I shouldn't say this on camera,
but you know,

707
00:47:45.730 --> 00:47:48.010
I'm on Twitter and occasionally when I'm bored,

708
00:47:48.011 --> 00:47:49.870
when my daughter is having a swimming lesson,

709
00:47:49.871 --> 00:47:54.280
I will just basically pick a fight with a skeptic on Twitter.
I'm bored.

710
00:47:54.370 --> 00:47:59.020
Climate change is real.
Ha ha ha.
No,
it was something that,
so we all do,

711
00:47:59.290 --> 00:48:00.820
we have different approaches.

712
00:48:01.150 --> 00:48:05.800
So Richard Bets at the Met Office is incredibly polite and conciliatory and

713
00:48:05.801 --> 00:48:08.560
we'll basically invite them over for dinner and things like that.

714
00:48:08.800 --> 00:48:12.370
They still don't change their mind.
I'm slightly less friendly,

715
00:48:13.360 --> 00:48:17.800
so yeah,
but we do it.
There's a huge amount.
It's actually easier here.

716
00:48:18.490 --> 00:48:19.510
I gain,

717
00:48:19.570 --> 00:48:23.710
I have utmost respect for my colleagues in the U s who deal with it in the US

718
00:48:23.711 --> 00:48:26.110
because it is vicious.

719
00:48:33.640 --> 00:48:38.640
What would you recommend as a cause of action for us as individuals who sort of

720
00:48:40.211 --> 00:48:43.060
believe in this course?
Right?

721
00:48:44.050 --> 00:48:49.050
So the individual actions are problematic.

722
00:48:49.450 --> 00:48:51.160
The reason being is because,

723
00:48:51.370 --> 00:48:56.170
not because I don't think that you should try to be aware of your own carbon

724
00:48:56.171 --> 00:48:58.540
footprint and influence the people around you.

725
00:48:58.840 --> 00:49:03.840
But the big problem is that if we all went and lived in Wales in a commune

726
00:49:04.560 --> 00:49:07.960
intense with a link to Google,
um,

727
00:49:08.080 --> 00:49:12.130
the problem then is our carbon footprint.
We don't need drop by half.

728
00:49:12.940 --> 00:49:17.940
The reason being is half the pollution that we emit every year is done by the

729
00:49:17.951 --> 00:49:22.210
government on our behalf.
Hospitals where welds,
uh,

730
00:49:22.780 --> 00:49:24.250
all of that.
Okay.

731
00:49:24.490 --> 00:49:29.490
So the key thing is actually being able to live as good as we can.

732
00:49:31.780 --> 00:49:32.980
So again,

733
00:49:33.130 --> 00:49:36.850
move towards a more vegetarian diet is usually a very good one for your health

734
00:49:37.240 --> 00:49:41.910
and for sort of how the environment at try to cut down on your,
uh,

735
00:49:42.140 --> 00:49:45.310
uh,
flights.
If you can and try to do that,

736
00:49:45.850 --> 00:49:48.700
have a better house or if that's great,

737
00:49:49.060 --> 00:49:54.060
but actually the most important thing you can do is work through the democratic

738
00:49:54.071 --> 00:49:58.540
system and make sure you have policy makers in place that are going to make a

739
00:49:58.541 --> 00:49:59.374
difference.

740
00:49:59.410 --> 00:50:04.410
Now the interesting thing is for a good 15 years when we had Tony Blair and

741
00:50:06.310 --> 00:50:07.143
Gordon Brown,

742
00:50:08.200 --> 00:50:11.800
they were obsessed with climate change and it went into every single layer of

743
00:50:11.801 --> 00:50:15.920
government.
And even after two,
uh,

744
00:50:16.060 --> 00:50:17.050
other governments,

745
00:50:17.230 --> 00:50:21.790
they're still all that regulation that they're still trying to unpick.
So again,

746
00:50:22.300 --> 00:50:25.420
actually policymaking is where it is.
So again,

747
00:50:25.600 --> 00:50:30.600
I'd say it's actually being a voter or making sure your local MP knows that you

748
00:50:31.341 --> 00:50:32.600
care about this passionately.

749
00:50:36.440 --> 00:50:38.800
Yeah,
you pretty much answered my question.
Um,

750
00:50:38.810 --> 00:50:43.810
I want us to talk about factory farming and how much influence that has in your

751
00:50:44.271 --> 00:50:45.890
opinion.
Right.

752
00:50:45.980 --> 00:50:50.840
So farming is a double edge sword.
Okay.
It's a nightmare.

753
00:50:50.841 --> 00:50:55.190
So I'll give you as much as I can.
Firstly,
uh,

754
00:50:55.370 --> 00:51:00.230
industrialized farming,
like factory farming is highly,

755
00:51:00.620 --> 00:51:05.090
uh,
fossil fuel intensive.
Again,
heating,

756
00:51:05.091 --> 00:51:08.660
lighting,
et Cetera,
et cetera.
And also interestingly,

757
00:51:08.780 --> 00:51:13.580
cows under that system produce a lot of methane from both ends.

758
00:51:13.581 --> 00:51:17.300
My daughter loves this that they make the more from the front than the back.

759
00:51:17.301 --> 00:51:21.230
Ashley.
Um,
so huge carbon footprint,

760
00:51:21.620 --> 00:51:26.620
but catch 22 is that we're going to have an extra 2 billion people in the world.

761
00:51:28.220 --> 00:51:33.220
And actually the green revolution that happened in South America and Asia are

762
00:51:33.590 --> 00:51:38.390
great,
didn't happen in Africa so much that we need to actually deal with that.

763
00:51:38.690 --> 00:51:42.860
The poor miss.
If we're going to produce enough food in the future,

764
00:51:43.070 --> 00:51:46.370
we need to help them industrialized air farming,

765
00:51:46.880 --> 00:51:50.810
which is going to produce more CEO to a more methane.

766
00:51:50.960 --> 00:51:53.630
So it's that catch 22.
Yes,

767
00:51:53.780 --> 00:51:58.780
in this country we could do farming in a much Greenaway and produce less co two

768
00:51:59.750 --> 00:52:01.550
brilliant and we'll still produce the same amount of food,

769
00:52:01.880 --> 00:52:06.770
but we're also then going to have to try and help other countries
industrialized.

770
00:52:06.771 --> 00:52:09.860
They're farming in perhaps the greenest way they can.

771
00:52:10.550 --> 00:52:13.970
So does that answer your question?
It is a problem.

772
00:52:14.240 --> 00:52:16.580
It is a nice one that we need to actually deal with.

773
00:52:16.880 --> 00:52:21.880
But actually the solution is also complicated by there being a growth in

774
00:52:22.341 --> 00:52:27.290
population time for one more question,
two more questions

775
00:52:30.290 --> 00:52:31.460
<v 6>just to follow on from that,</v>

776
00:52:31.461 --> 00:52:33.470
but maybe to ask a question that's a little closer to home.

777
00:52:33.471 --> 00:52:36.050
How do you view the growth of the IT sector?

778
00:52:36.590 --> 00:52:38.660
Is that a problem or is that a solution?

779
00:52:39.250 --> 00:52:41.470
<v 0>So well,
interesting thing.
So I,</v>

780
00:52:41.530 --> 00:52:46.330
I am on a corporate social responsibility board for big it company,

781
00:52:46.690 --> 00:52:50.200
uh,
set for Australia in French.
Um,

782
00:52:50.230 --> 00:52:53.620
but mainly Europe and India.
And so again,

783
00:52:53.621 --> 00:52:58.621
the interesting thing is that it has a really interesting intersection.

784
00:53:00.250 --> 00:53:05.250
One because firstly you do produce a lot of carbon basically cause you have

785
00:53:06.161 --> 00:53:07.960
server farms,
et Cetera,
et cetera.

786
00:53:08.200 --> 00:53:13.060
And it's interesting that lots of companies like Amazon are actually making sure

787
00:53:13.061 --> 00:53:15.580
that those have as low footprint as possible.
Williams.

788
00:53:15.970 --> 00:53:20.140
Second thing is what we found and I've got a,
I was telling,
um,

789
00:53:20.170 --> 00:53:25.170
yeah and I have a spinout company set out and Harwell because companies want to

790
00:53:25.321 --> 00:53:27.000
be green.
Okay.
That's the first thing.

791
00:53:27.240 --> 00:53:29.610
They want to manage them environmental resources.

792
00:53:29.880 --> 00:53:33.600
But they are because they know that also it makes financial sense.

793
00:53:33.601 --> 00:53:35.280
It saves them money as well as everything else.

794
00:53:35.640 --> 00:53:40.140
The problem they have in this day and age is lack of knowledge because there's

795
00:53:40.141 --> 00:53:44.490
so much data.
So it companies absolutely essential because again,

796
00:53:44.670 --> 00:53:48.330
if you want to measure your CEO to footprint of your company,

797
00:53:48.900 --> 00:53:53.070
most companies go,
I make widgets,
how am I going to do that?

798
00:53:53.071 --> 00:53:57.000
And that's when it comes in and actually be able to automate knowledge and data

799
00:53:57.001 --> 00:54:00.000
and how you produce it.
So,
um,
interestingly enough,

800
00:54:00.090 --> 00:54:04.890
I think it is right at the heart of this because if you have data and you start

801
00:54:04.891 --> 00:54:07.500
measuring things,
things get better.

802
00:54:07.720 --> 00:54:10.830
We found that with the Millennium Development Goals Globally,

803
00:54:11.340 --> 00:54:16.080
if people start measuring something,
people then start focusing on it and go,

804
00:54:16.530 --> 00:54:20.880
Ooh,
now that's bad.
Right?
Okay,
we can move it on.
So yeah,
right at the heart

805
00:54:23.280 --> 00:54:24.750
and know that it wasn't,
because I'm at Google,

806
00:54:26.070 --> 00:54:28.590
we have server farms and we try and keep

807
00:54:30.370 --> 00:54:34.110
a quick question.
Do you think we all manage to stay at a two degree world?

808
00:54:36.110 --> 00:54:40.680
Oh,
thank you.
So just,
just put me on the spot here.
Um,
honestly,

809
00:54:40.681 --> 00:54:45.681
the conversations that scientists have is highly unlikely we are going to stay

810
00:54:45.961 --> 00:54:47.010
to a two degree world.

811
00:54:47.370 --> 00:54:51.870
The most obvious thing was that four years ago,
uh,

812
00:54:51.900 --> 00:54:56.900
Oxford organized a conference called living in a four degree world.

813
00:54:57.630 --> 00:55:02.520
Okay.
And the problem there is that this wasn't mentally before Paris.

814
00:55:02.790 --> 00:55:04.860
So Paris has given us some hope.
I mean,

815
00:55:04.861 --> 00:55:09.060
Paris even talks about having a one and a half degree target.
Okay.
I mean,

816
00:55:09.061 --> 00:55:12.930
I can barely work out how to get to a two degree target.
And that's myth.

817
00:55:13.080 --> 00:55:16.980
Me being world dictator.
Okay.
Um,
no idea how to get to one and a half.

818
00:55:17.850 --> 00:55:22.410
We're unlikely to hit the two degree target.
However,

819
00:55:23.370 --> 00:55:28.370
my view is how close we can come to that and be as far away from four degrees or

820
00:55:31.171 --> 00:55:35.760
six degrees as possible.
The better.
So as a target,
brilliant.

821
00:55:35.910 --> 00:55:40.140
If we miss it by a small amount or even half a degree,
um,
I'm,

822
00:55:40.320 --> 00:55:43.440
I will be happy.
Okay.
But no,

823
00:55:43.500 --> 00:55:48.360
we're not ever going to make the two degree target.
Thank you very much.

824
