1
00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:10.221
All right.
So look,

2
00:00:10.221 --> 00:00:15.221
I don't want to have one of these talks where I just drone on for some very long

3
00:00:15.741 --> 00:00:17.690
period of time and then there's a question period afterwards.

4
00:00:17.691 --> 00:00:22.100
So please feel free to ask questions,
you know,
during the,
during the talk.

5
00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.791
However,

6
00:00:22.791 --> 00:00:27.791
if the question seems to me to be one that's going to involve a long detailed

7
00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:30.620
kind of thing,
I will suggest putting it off till the end.

8
00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:32.750
So I normally talk for an hour,

9
00:00:32.751 --> 00:00:35.990
but I guess an hour is really more or less the time of the whole thing here.

10
00:00:35.991 --> 00:00:38.570
So I'll have to cut stuff out.

11
00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:43.160
Maybe it will be easier to do as I move along.
Um,
okay,

12
00:00:43.161 --> 00:00:44.270
so let me start with this.

13
00:00:44.271 --> 00:00:48.900
So called hard problem of consciousness and that,
uh,

14
00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:54.190
is the problem of why the brain basis of a given experience is the brain basis

15
00:00:55.581 --> 00:01:00.581
of that experience as opposed to another experience or none.

16
00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:06.800
Here's an example.
So,
um,
this is,
uh,

17
00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:08.210
a brain.
The,

18
00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:13.460
all the arrows are pointing to the back of the brain where the early visual

19
00:01:13.461 --> 00:01:15.420
cortex is.
Um,

20
00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:20.750
so there's this area empty and maybe if some surrounding areas like MST that are

21
00:01:20.751 --> 00:01:25.580
known to be the basis of our experience of a certain kind of motion of a optic

22
00:01:25.581 --> 00:01:29.210
flow.
Um,
if you knock that out,

23
00:01:29.211 --> 00:01:34.040
people have a what's called Aiken,
a top CEO where they don't see motion.

24
00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:39.290
Um,
and then nothing gets activated whenever people see,
um,
uh,

25
00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.740
when people do see motion,
even if it's after images of motion,

26
00:01:42.741 --> 00:01:46.220
like a waterfall illusion.
Um,
okay.

27
00:01:46.221 --> 00:01:49.160
So we know that as at least a large part of our,

28
00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.010
of the neural basis of our experience of motion.

29
00:01:52.011 --> 00:01:57.011
But why is it the neuro basis of that experience of motion rather than say the

30
00:01:58.041 --> 00:02:02.420
experience of a face or something else entirely?
Okay.

31
00:02:02.421 --> 00:02:04.460
So nobody,
it's not just a,

32
00:02:04.461 --> 00:02:07.730
nobody has a clue how to answer that is nobody has even come up with a

33
00:02:07.731 --> 00:02:12.440
hypothetical,
a answer to it.
That is that it all,

34
00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:14.870
is it all satisfactory?
That's why it's the hard problem.

35
00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:19.310
And that's distinguished from,
uh,
the easy problems.

36
00:02:19.311 --> 00:02:23.630
These are my terms,
uh,
produced by my colleague David Chalmers.

37
00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:25.140
Um,

38
00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:30.080
and the easy problems or problems about the function of conscious experience,

39
00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.770
um,

40
00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:35.390
how it interacts with a sensory inputs with other mental states like beliefs or

41
00:02:35.391 --> 00:02:40.140
thoughts and how it affects,
um,
um,
uh,
uh,
uh,

42
00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:45.170
behavioral outputs.
Um,
so those are the so called easy problems.
Now,

43
00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:48.590
um,
a common distinction made,
um,
is uh,

44
00:02:48.591 --> 00:02:51.050
between phenomenal consciousness.

45
00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:56.450
That's what the hard problem is about.
Um,
what it's like just smell a rose,

46
00:02:56.451 --> 00:03:00.820
see the sky,
feel a pain and access consciousness,

47
00:03:00.821 --> 00:03:05.821
which is perhaps can be defined as global availability of the information in an

48
00:03:06.071 --> 00:03:07.990
experience.
Um,

49
00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:12.520
so access consciousness is the domain of the easy problems.

50
00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:17.140
Phenomenal consciousness is the domain of the hard problem.

51
00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.660
Now there is,
um,

52
00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:23.200
it is commonly felt and I think that that's,

53
00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:27.530
that that's the feeling I'm talking about.
It is probably present,
uh,

54
00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:32.820
in this room among people who have a kind of engineering way of looking at

55
00:03:33.821 --> 00:03:35.220
things.
Um,

56
00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:39.900
that there really isn't any serious difference between the phenomenal conscious

57
00:03:39.901 --> 00:03:42.010
to an access conscious.
Maybe no difference at all.

58
00:03:42.011 --> 00:03:46.990
Maybe all phenomenal conscious could ever come to is access consciousness or

59
00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:50.440
another thought that is related to that is maybe,

60
00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:52.870
maybe there's a difference in some conceptual way,

61
00:03:52.871 --> 00:03:57.400
but it's not something we could ever find out about because all you know about

62
00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:01.720
anything is how it functions,
how it affects other things.

63
00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:04.600
And we've already said that's the domain of access conscious.

64
00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:08.710
So how could we ever find out about this stuff?
Um,

65
00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:10.061
I used to teach,

66
00:04:10.061 --> 00:04:14.440
I taught at Mit for 25 years and I found that that point of view was a,

67
00:04:14.441 --> 00:04:17.050
was very common among my,
among my students.

68
00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:21.030
It's better for me to do it for me here.
Second.

69
00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:25.510
Um,
okay.
So,
um,

70
00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:29.620
what I'm going to argue,
well,
I'm not really going to argue this,

71
00:04:29.621 --> 00:04:32.560
but I will be saying that,
um,

72
00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:37.180
phenomenal consciousness seems to be better approached through biological

73
00:04:37.181 --> 00:04:41.430
approaches rather than computer approaches.
Computational approaches are,

74
00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:45.300
are better fitted to access consciousness.
Um,

75
00:04:45.301 --> 00:04:46.690
I'm not gonna argue about that explicit,

76
00:04:46.691 --> 00:04:51.430
but what I am going to talk about is how we know these things are different and

77
00:04:51.431 --> 00:04:54.700
I'll give you some actual evidence that they are different.

78
00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:58.120
And say a little bit about how they're different.
Um,

79
00:04:58.121 --> 00:05:03.121
so the issue I'm going to be talking about is our conscious perception and

80
00:05:03.431 --> 00:05:06.670
cognitive access to perception.
That is access consciousness,

81
00:05:06.671 --> 00:05:10.420
fundamentally different talks going to have three parts.

82
00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:16.110
I'll talk about a controversy about sparse versus rich perception about

83
00:05:17.021 --> 00:05:18.510
concepts.
And then I'll,
I'll,

84
00:05:18.511 --> 00:05:23.350
I'll end with these methodological breakthroughs that I think have something to

85
00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:27.280
say about how to approach the issue experimentally.

86
00:05:27.281 --> 00:05:31.510
And I should say by the way that the experimental approach to this subject

87
00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:35.500
really is only about 20 years old.
Before that,
you know,

88
00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:37.690
consciousness research was,
uh,

89
00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:41.800
not a serious thing was regarded as a,
um,

90
00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:44.470
a tenure killer among scientists.

91
00:05:44.471 --> 00:05:49.300
That is if you study it for get tenure.
Um,
okay,

92
00:05:49.301 --> 00:05:54.100
so,
um,
sparse versus rich first.
So there is a debate,

93
00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:57.160
uh,
between,
um,
uh,

94
00:05:57.170 --> 00:06:01.610
the view that a conscious perception is sparse and that conscious perception is

95
00:06:01.611 --> 00:06:06.330
rich.
I myself think that the resolution of the debate,
um,

96
00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:10.370
is that it's cognition that's actually sparse,
that sport reasoning,

97
00:06:10.371 --> 00:06:14.870
problem solving,
um,
and that actual conscious perception is rich.

98
00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:18.380
And that shows that conscious perception must be,

99
00:06:18.381 --> 00:06:20.810
at least in part distinct from cognition.

100
00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:26.570
What suggests that conscious perception is rich here is an experimental

101
00:06:26.571 --> 00:06:30.220
paradigm.
Um,
um,

102
00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:34.850
due to George Sperling,
uh,
so first you have,

103
00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:39.170
I guess I can use this thing.
Can you see that pointer?
Okay,

104
00:06:39.171 --> 00:06:42.940
so you first you have an array of Alpha numeric.
Yup.

105
00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:50.220
Are so rich in your terminology is the machine learning version of it,

106
00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:55.100
which a lot of,
oh here probably,
I'm sure it's different.
Uh,

107
00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:57.410
you will see that,
uh,

108
00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:02.450
it's going to be defined in fact by um,
some experiments I'm going to show you.

109
00:07:02.451 --> 00:07:06.320
But the idea is that cognition,
um,

110
00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:11.270
for certain kinds of materials only holds about four items.

111
00:07:11.730 --> 00:07:15.020
Um,
that is quirky.
It's really what's called working memory.
If you want to,

112
00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:20.300
if you're interested in how people think there is a mental scratch pad known as

113
00:07:20.301 --> 00:07:25.280
working memory.
If you want to,
for example,
go from p and if p then Q two Q,

114
00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:30.490
you've got a store p and if p then Q in your working memory and that holds about

115
00:07:32.091 --> 00:07:35.330
four items.
Now there's a controversy about what exactly an item is.

116
00:07:35.331 --> 00:07:38.600
And there are many controversies about it.
But that's the basic idea.

117
00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:43.500
And it's common to not only,
um,
um,
um,
uh,

118
00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:46.790
mammals,
but also birds,
lizards.

119
00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:49.790
And there's even some evidence that this is rough.

120
00:07:49.791 --> 00:07:52.940
Something like this is the limit even in insects.

121
00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:57.830
So it is a ubiquitous feature of,
um,
um,

122
00:07:57.860 --> 00:08:02.120
of,
you know,
um,
information processing in animals,

123
00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:07.040
uh,
however the number,
so that's sparse.
Okay.

124
00:08:07.250 --> 00:08:11.880
Rich is what's in phenomenal consciousness.
Um,

125
00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:14.960
so that holds many more things.
And that's what I'm gonna Argue.

126
00:08:15.530 --> 00:08:19.610
So it's a way of getting at the fact that they are different.
Okay.

127
00:08:19.611 --> 00:08:22.970
So here is the idea of the,
this experiment.

128
00:08:24.050 --> 00:08:27.980
You show people a,
uh,
an array for a very brief time.

129
00:08:28.810 --> 00:08:32.240
Um,
uh,
and then after the raise bone off,

130
00:08:32.241 --> 00:08:34.460
you ask them what they saw.

131
00:08:34.790 --> 00:08:39.770
People can report that they saw an array of Alpha numeric characters.

132
00:08:40.110 --> 00:08:43.340
Um,
but if you ask them for specific characters,

133
00:08:43.341 --> 00:08:45.860
they can usually report three or four.
Okay?

134
00:08:45.890 --> 00:08:50.740
So there's the limit of three or four.
Um,
so this Guy George Sperling's,

135
00:08:50.741 --> 00:08:54.540
it was in his phd thesis at Nyu,
uh,

136
00:08:55.530 --> 00:08:56.363
um,

137
00:08:56.610 --> 00:09:01.610
tried to explore the idea that people felt that they saw all or almost all of

138
00:09:01.651 --> 00:09:05.970
those items.
And that's,
you know,
it's easy to be a subject in this.

139
00:09:05.971 --> 00:09:09.960
You can do it yourself and you'll have that sense that you saw all or almost
all.

140
00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:14.130
Um,
so what he did was how many new about this,
I'm just curious.

141
00:09:15.570 --> 00:09:15.901
Okay.

142
00:09:15.901 --> 00:09:20.901
No one here has ever taken an intro psych course with my guess.

143
00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:24.210
Um,
okay.
So here's what he did.

144
00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:28.860
He in this blank period before you have to answer,

145
00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:32.220
he used a high tone from the top row,

146
00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:37.580
a medium tones for the middle row and a low tone for the bottom row.

147
00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:43.340
And what he found was they could report three or four from any given row,

148
00:09:45.870 --> 00:09:50.640
even though they could also report only three or four if not given a cue.

149
00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:55.080
And this is called partial report superiority.

150
00:09:55.081 --> 00:10:00.081
And the idea is that your phenomenal awareness ha has a capacity of three times

151
00:10:02.971 --> 00:10:07.350
three and a half,
whereas you can only report three or four.
Okay.

152
00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:12.660
So that is an index of richness.
And here's the spurling,
um,
um,

153
00:10:12.990 --> 00:10:14.690
saying,
um,
uh,

154
00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:18.930
that people insist that they've seen more than they can report afterwards.
Okay.

155
00:10:18.931 --> 00:10:21.870
So that's the kind of thing that suggests rich.

156
00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:26.760
What about what suggests sparse?
So here's a,
a,

157
00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:31.080
undoubtedly everybody's seen one of these things.
You have a picture,
a blank,

158
00:10:31.650 --> 00:10:34.200
another picture that's different from the first one,
a blank,

159
00:10:34.201 --> 00:10:36.780
and then you start over.
Uh,

160
00:10:36.781 --> 00:10:40.760
this is a paradigm developed by these guys are Reagan Rensin consignments.

161
00:10:40.770 --> 00:10:41.940
And here's an example.

162
00:10:46.170 --> 00:10:50.880
How many see what's changing?
Okay.

163
00:10:50.910 --> 00:10:55.320
I am going to show you what's changing and I hope you'll be surprised.

164
00:10:56.250 --> 00:11:01.020
There it is.
See,
okay.
How many are surprised?

165
00:11:02.930 --> 00:11:07.730
Why are you surprised?
You're surprised because it's a big change,

166
00:11:07.820 --> 00:11:10.580
so,
right.
You know,
it's not exactly in the middle,
but it's a kind of,

167
00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:13.370
it's a big change.
You feel like you saw the whole thing,

168
00:11:13.371 --> 00:11:18.020
but if you did see the whole thing,
why didn't you see the difference?

169
00:11:18.620 --> 00:11:21.980
Um,
I'll show you a couple more here.
Uh,

170
00:11:23.690 --> 00:11:24.523
here's another one.

171
00:11:29.150 --> 00:11:29.540
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

172
00:11:29.540 --> 00:11:33.220
<v 0>How many?
See what's changing?
Oh,</v>

173
00:11:33.221 --> 00:11:37.150
it's a little easier this time.
Uh,
okay.
How many,

174
00:11:37.230 --> 00:11:41.920
I mean it's just how many don't see what's changing.
Okay,
good.

175
00:11:42.430 --> 00:11:45.670
Okay.
I'm going to move this pointer to it.
There it is there.

176
00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:51.530
Okay.
I'll do one more just because they're fun.

177
00:11:55.130 --> 00:11:59.720
Okay.
What's changing?
Is this the,
Ooh,
not doing very well here.

178
00:12:00.050 --> 00:12:03.320
Something's the matter with it.
Uh,
I'm sorry,
somebody was only that.
Okay.

179
00:12:03.321 --> 00:12:08.090
So here is a very pathetic one that I'm going to use this.
You'll see why.

180
00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:13.190
Uh,
so this one is very,
so this was originally made for a PC.

181
00:12:13.191 --> 00:12:16.040
I'm using it on a Mac and I,
you know,

182
00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:18.200
I'm not skilled enough to get it to go faster,

183
00:12:18.201 --> 00:12:21.980
but something is actually changing.
How many see what's changing.

184
00:12:23.210 --> 00:12:26.000
Okay.
I'll tell you what it is.
It's the bar in the back.
See.

185
00:12:29.630 --> 00:12:30.110
Okay.

186
00:12:30.110 --> 00:12:34.460
The reason I'm using that is because I happen to have an eye tracker trace of it

187
00:12:35.150 --> 00:12:38.720
and this gives you a little,
a recipe for making these things.

188
00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:44.080
So the trace only involves one hit on the bar.

189
00:12:45.710 --> 00:12:50.360
Um,
and that is an index of the fact that people are not,

190
00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:53.180
by and large not attending to the bar.

191
00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:56.890
And that tells you what you can change in these pictures.
Um,

192
00:12:56.980 --> 00:12:59.180
and this is a culture relative thing.

193
00:12:59.181 --> 00:13:02.180
It's different cultures will attend and different genders will attend to

194
00:13:02.181 --> 00:13:03.560
different things.
Um,

195
00:13:04.100 --> 00:13:09.100
but if you change something that people tend not to attend to,

196
00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:13.100
then people will not notice the difference.

197
00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:18.500
And that is one of many items of evidence that this is an attentional

198
00:13:18.501 --> 00:13:19.160
phenomenon.

199
00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:24.160
But there are two different accounts of what kind of an attentional phenomenon

200
00:13:26.750 --> 00:13:31.250
is.
One account is this,
uh,
inattentional blindness account,

201
00:13:31.790 --> 00:13:36.790
which is you don't consciously see the features that change.

202
00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:38.440
<v 1>Okay?</v>

203
00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:39.700
<v 0>That's the sparse view.</v>

204
00:13:40.630 --> 00:13:45.110
The other view is the inattentional in accessibility.

205
00:13:45.570 --> 00:13:49.030
Um,
or sorry,
lack of access,
not inaccessibility,

206
00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:53.200
lack of actual access.
You do see the features that change,

207
00:13:53.410 --> 00:13:58.410
but you don't conceptualize them at a level that would allow you to notice the

208
00:13:59.351 --> 00:14:03.310
change.
And that difference is going to figure in this whole talk.

209
00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:08.880
The difference between not actually seen it on the one hand a sports view.

210
00:14:09.370 --> 00:14:11.080
And on the other hand,
the rich view,

211
00:14:11.410 --> 00:14:14.860
you see it but you don't conceptualize it at a level.

212
00:14:14.861 --> 00:14:19.240
And here's a little diagram of the difference between the two views and I'm

213
00:14:19.241 --> 00:14:20.260
going to be contrasting.

214
00:14:20.980 --> 00:14:25.980
So this is the top one is my view that you have rich conscious perception.

215
00:14:28.540 --> 00:14:31.990
There's an attentional bottleneck and then you have sparse cognition.

216
00:14:32.020 --> 00:14:33.520
My opponents view,

217
00:14:33.970 --> 00:14:38.970
because they have to explain partial report superiority just as I do their view

218
00:14:40.810 --> 00:14:45.810
is that the bottleneck is between unconscious perception and conscious

219
00:14:46.301 --> 00:14:49.480
perception.
Conscious perception is sparse and cognition is sparse.

220
00:14:50.170 --> 00:14:55.170
So I'm now going to show you a few pieces of anecdotal evidence for my view.

221
00:14:56.570 --> 00:14:57.403
Okay?

222
00:14:57.480 --> 00:14:58.910
<v 2>Yup.
Quickly,</v>

223
00:14:59.090 --> 00:15:02.180
how would you describe the differences between conscious and unconscious

224
00:15:02.181 --> 00:15:03.670
perception?
Yeah.

225
00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:07.640
Is it an awareness to the information or is it more than that?

226
00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:11.570
<v 0>Well,
remember I started with the idea of phenomenal conscience.</v>

227
00:15:11.571 --> 00:15:16.380
It's what it's like to smell a rose,
you know,
to hear,
uh,
you know,
um,

228
00:15:16.470 --> 00:15:20.430
of a musical note in conscious perception,

229
00:15:20.431 --> 00:15:24.540
you're having that and an unconscious perception,
you're not having it.

230
00:15:25.170 --> 00:15:30.170
So it's a commonly noted a thing in the literature on consciousness that no one

231
00:15:31.861 --> 00:15:35.820
has a definition of phenomenal consciousness.

232
00:15:35.821 --> 00:15:40.821
It's something you can only point to by using phrases like my colleague Thomas

233
00:15:41.780 --> 00:15:46.290
Nagel phrase,
what it's like to experience experience,
you know,

234
00:15:46.291 --> 00:15:48.990
the redness of red or um,

235
00:15:49.530 --> 00:15:54.530
and of course this not surprisingly has given rise to the idea that when people

236
00:15:54.721 --> 00:15:58.380
set talk this way they don't know what they're talking about and that there

237
00:15:58.381 --> 00:16:03.000
isn't any really any difference between accessing information and having an

238
00:16:03.001 --> 00:16:07.620
experience of the redness of red.
Furthermore,
a lot of people see,
oh,

239
00:16:08.610 --> 00:16:12.870
maybe there is such a thing,
but I don't like it.
So I've encountered that.

240
00:16:12.980 --> 00:16:15.400
You know,
I've gone around and giving talks on this for some time.

241
00:16:15.630 --> 00:16:18.420
I've been cutting a lot and I'm sure there are probably people in this room,

242
00:16:18.421 --> 00:16:22.230
many half the people in this room who don't like phenomenal consciousness.

243
00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:27.210
Why would anybody pay any attention to that?
Um,
but I'll tell you,

244
00:16:27.211 --> 00:16:32.211
I think that it is unwise for people certainly in my business,

245
00:16:32.431 --> 00:16:37.431
but also in yours to ignore such a salient feature of our mental lives because

246
00:16:40.801 --> 00:16:45.090
it may turn out to be really crucial to things you actually do care about.

247
00:16:45.510 --> 00:16:46.710
So I think,

248
00:16:47.130 --> 00:16:52.130
I think people really should keep an open mind about there being phenomenal

249
00:16:52.921 --> 00:16:53.521
consciousness,

250
00:16:53.521 --> 00:16:58.521
what its role is and people should not adopt the view that a lot of people do,

251
00:16:58.531 --> 00:17:03.060
which is that we can approach issues for example in artificial intelligence is

252
00:17:03.061 --> 00:17:07.840
just ignoring this because if it turns out that um,

253
00:17:07.950 --> 00:17:12.950
a lot of our important mental processes are done via um,

254
00:17:14.180 --> 00:17:17.730
um,
uh,
phenomenal consciousness,
then it may be that we,

255
00:17:17.790 --> 00:17:19.840
if we trying to make machine learning,
you know,

256
00:17:19.890 --> 00:17:24.600
machines do significant cognitive things that we're going to have to in some way

257
00:17:24.990 --> 00:17:29.940
give them that or some substitute for it that does the same job or something.

258
00:17:29.940 --> 00:17:34.940
But we'd better know about it before we figure out figure that we don't have to

259
00:17:35.191 --> 00:17:36.024
pay any attention yet

260
00:17:37.430 --> 00:17:38.840
<v 2>describing it's nice to do,</v>

261
00:17:38.850 --> 00:17:42.700
aren't going to a meeting like the rope memory and was hearing for example like

262
00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:47.060
[inaudible] since it's the same information processing and memories.

263
00:17:48.980 --> 00:17:50.220
All right.
Yep.
Yeah,
I have,
I was

264
00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:53.940
<v 0>the one who in that's,
that's kind of something that is okay.</v>

265
00:17:53.941 --> 00:17:55.950
I think you could have consciousness without memory.

266
00:17:56.640 --> 00:18:01.140
The reason I'm talking about memory is because it's involved in a lot of

267
00:18:01.141 --> 00:18:02.070
experiments.

268
00:18:02.550 --> 00:18:06.780
So I think it is possible to think about consciousness in the absence of,

269
00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:10.380
without thinking about memory at all.
But um,
you know,

270
00:18:10.410 --> 00:18:15.410
you have to have some experimental approach to consciousness to be thinking

271
00:18:15.571 --> 00:18:20.160
about it in an objective way.
So memory turns out to be really important.

272
00:18:20.161 --> 00:18:22.800
And I'm really contrasting two kinds of memory,

273
00:18:23.310 --> 00:18:27.720
what is sometimes called iconic memory that has some kind of phenomenology to
it,

274
00:18:28.170 --> 00:18:32.520
um,
and working memory,
which is,
uh,
the,
the,
our cognitive workspace.
So,

275
00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:37.920
but that's not because I think memory is crucial to consciousness is because

276
00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:38.940
it's a,

277
00:18:38.940 --> 00:18:43.940
it's a way of getting x or way of approaching the subject that where we know

278
00:18:44.971 --> 00:18:49.820
something about how to do experiments on.
So here is,
so I'm going to,

279
00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:52.110
so just to remind you of what's about to happen,

280
00:18:52.740 --> 00:18:57.740
I'm going to show you two phenomena that I think give a kind of anecdotal

281
00:19:00.031 --> 00:19:04.350
support for my view.
Okay.
So here's the first one.

282
00:19:04.590 --> 00:19:07.720
How many have seen this?
Anybody seen this?
Okay,

283
00:19:08.010 --> 00:19:12.020
this is a slow change.
Uh,

284
00:19:12.210 --> 00:19:17.210
so what you were looking at on the screen is changing right now and your job is

285
00:19:17.821 --> 00:19:20.310
to try to figure out what is changing.

286
00:19:23.970 --> 00:19:24.760
<v 1>Okay.</v>

287
00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:29.050
<v 0>Don't say,
okay,
let's,
let's just look at it.
Okay,</v>

288
00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:32.890
let's try to figure out what's changing.
Don't say what's changing.
If you know,

289
00:19:34.130 --> 00:19:37.870
is this a question about this as a vet to say when it's not changing?
Oh No,

290
00:19:37.871 --> 00:19:38.704
don't say that.

291
00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:51.140
How many soul,
what was changing.
Okay.

292
00:19:51.230 --> 00:19:54.740
I'm now going to show you and I think most of you will be surprised.
Okay.

293
00:19:54.950 --> 00:19:59.720
I'm just going to click on this thing here.
See it?
Everybody see,
okay.

294
00:19:59.721 --> 00:20:03.980
So here's the thing.
Okay,

295
00:20:03.981 --> 00:20:08.981
so here is the intuitive force of this.

296
00:20:09.950 --> 00:20:13.610
I think this argue strongly for my side.
Why do I think that?

297
00:20:13.611 --> 00:20:16.730
Because look at that base.

298
00:20:16.790 --> 00:20:19.370
It's a huge part of the picture.

299
00:20:19.970 --> 00:20:24.710
You were staring at that thing looking around,
moving your eyes around.

300
00:20:25.150 --> 00:20:29.090
You know,
it was on the screen for almost a minute.
And I think,
um,

301
00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:34.310
you must have looked at that thing a few times.
But here's the thing,

302
00:20:35.150 --> 00:20:36.470
why didn't you notice the change?

303
00:20:36.500 --> 00:20:41.500
It's because you didn't conceptualize the color.

304
00:20:41.511 --> 00:20:46.250
You didn't say to yourself at the beginning read.
And at the end purple,

305
00:20:46.460 --> 00:20:49.510
you didn't say the words red or purple.

306
00:20:49.511 --> 00:20:54.370
If you had conceptualized them,
applied your cognition to it,

307
00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:56.650
then you would have been able to notice it.

308
00:20:56.650 --> 00:21:00.880
But it's hard to notice something that you don't conceptualize.

309
00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:05.830
So I think that this suggests that.
Okay,

310
00:21:05.831 --> 00:21:08.440
so this is thing I haven't introduced the global workspace,

311
00:21:08.441 --> 00:21:12.430
so I'll mention that in a minute.
Um,
but,
um,
uh,

312
00:21:12.460 --> 00:21:17.410
the global workspaces and oppose theory of consciousness a opposed to mine.

313
00:21:17.860 --> 00:21:22.020
Um,
and,
uh,
I think,
um,
uh,
uh,
I'll,

314
00:21:22.100 --> 00:21:26.260
I'll explain this in a minute,
but I think why I think the,
um,
uh,

315
00:21:26.620 --> 00:21:30.460
the reason that something isn't broadcast global workspaces,

316
00:21:30.461 --> 00:21:33.400
it's not conceptualized.
Now I'm going to show you another one.

317
00:21:33.700 --> 00:21:38.650
How many have seen this?
Oh,
good.
Um,
this is,
well,

318
00:21:38.651 --> 00:21:43.060
I'm not even to tell you what it is,
but just watch and listen to the sound here

319
00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:53.500
<v 3>precisely for this.
After know</v>

320
00:21:57.490 --> 00:22:00.250
each of you to tell me your whereabouts.

321
00:22:00.860 --> 00:22:04.330
I see the time that they started,
the Dean took place

322
00:22:07.080 --> 00:22:08.630
in the master bedroom.

323
00:22:13.750 --> 00:22:16.900
I was plugging my

324
00:22:19.260 --> 00:22:20.093
arrest

325
00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:28.000
in two years until may is apt to take her away.

326
00:22:29.010 --> 00:22:30.840
<v 0>Okay.
So now what you're going to see,</v>

327
00:22:31.470 --> 00:22:35.790
you're going to see the whole thing over again from a different camera that

328
00:22:35.791 --> 00:22:36.690
shows you more.

329
00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:48.990
<v 3>Somebody in this room don't smile at precisely 30,</v>

330
00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:52.060
34 this afternoon was Ruthie.

331
00:22:55.570 --> 00:22:57.370
Tell me your warehouse.

332
00:22:58.320 --> 00:23:03.320
I see the time that it starts in the feet.

333
00:23:19.550 --> 00:23:24.420
<v 0>Okay.
So here,
this,
by the way,
this,
this is a BB c,</v>

334
00:23:24.820 --> 00:23:26.140
um,
uh,

335
00:23:26.580 --> 00:23:31.580
bicycle safety ad and it's this kind of work that,

336
00:23:32.210 --> 00:23:34.040
uh,
for example,
uh,

337
00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:39.080
made people realize that it's really a bad idea to talk on a cell phone while

338
00:23:39.121 --> 00:23:40.760
driving.
Um,

339
00:23:41.310 --> 00:23:44.130
and there's a lot of experimental work that backs that idea up.

340
00:23:44.131 --> 00:23:49.131
And the reason is this is an an attentional problem.

341
00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:54.650
Now my opponents like to think of this as inattentional blindness,

342
00:23:55.580 --> 00:23:58.880
but I think this case argues for my view,

343
00:23:58.881 --> 00:24:03.530
which is intentional lack of access to the difference.

344
00:24:03.740 --> 00:24:07.580
So,
and my reason for thinking that is,
I mean,
look,
for example,
at the,

345
00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:12.620
the guy who speaking you looked right at him.
It really,

346
00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:17.780
uh,
you really must have registered his coat,
for example.

347
00:24:18.110 --> 00:24:21.440
It was one color at the beginning and other color at the end and likewise for

348
00:24:21.450 --> 00:24:25.520
many other things.
So why didn't you notice the difference?
Well,

349
00:24:25.521 --> 00:24:29.900
I think you didn't notice the difference because you didn't conceptualize that

350
00:24:29.901 --> 00:24:30.734
color.

351
00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:35.830
So noticing is a lot easier if you conceptualize,

352
00:24:35.831 --> 00:24:40.831
and I keep using this word concept now I feel like I've used up about half of my

353
00:24:41.781 --> 00:24:45.620
time and I'm really nowhere near done.
Uh,

354
00:24:46.070 --> 00:24:51.020
so this is over it like roughly two.
Is that the idea?
Okay.
Well,
okay,
so look,

355
00:24:51.060 --> 00:24:53.660
I'll have to kind of skip around.
By the way,

356
00:24:53.661 --> 00:24:55.130
if you raise your hand and I don't see you,

357
00:24:55.131 --> 00:24:58.640
it's because the lights are kind of in my eyes,
so you might just wave your hand.

358
00:24:59.420 --> 00:25:03.620
Um,
so,
um,
okay.
So,

359
00:25:04.370 --> 00:25:08.810
um,
well maybe I should start skipping around.

360
00:25:11.350 --> 00:25:15.870
Well,
let me just mention one other experiment.
So this is,
uh,

361
00:25:15.930 --> 00:25:20.000
this is a sort of of spurling like experiment,
uh,

362
00:25:20.030 --> 00:25:24.640
done by a group in Amsterdam.
Um,
and um,

363
00:25:24.980 --> 00:25:28.200
the idea is that you have at the start,
you have,
uh,

364
00:25:28.520 --> 00:25:31.370
a a circle of rectangles,
eight rectangles,

365
00:25:31.730 --> 00:25:36.290
and then there's a blank period.
And then there's another circle of rectangles.

366
00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:39.800
And uh,
at some point there's a pointer at points,

367
00:25:39.801 --> 00:25:42.020
at a rectangle and the job of the subject.

368
00:25:42.021 --> 00:25:45.670
And the experiment is to say whether the new,
whether the,

369
00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:49.370
the rectangle pointed to is a different orientation from the first one.

370
00:25:49.550 --> 00:25:52.880
Everybody get that?
Okay?
So the answer in all these is yes,

371
00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:57.950
the point or can come at the end or it can come at the beginning or can come in

372
00:25:57.951 --> 00:26:00.920
the middle.
If it comes.
Um,
uh,

373
00:26:00.921 --> 00:26:03.770
at the beginning people can get almost all eight.

374
00:26:04.700 --> 00:26:08.180
If it comes at the end,
they can get four.

375
00:26:08.181 --> 00:26:11.210
And the idea here is that's the capacity of working memory,

376
00:26:11.211 --> 00:26:16.040
which we talked about before,
the new,
um,
uh,
array at the end,

377
00:26:16.370 --> 00:26:20.660
a wipes out your,
your,
your,
uh,
uh,
a phenomenal memory of,
uh,

378
00:26:20.661 --> 00:26:22.460
of the array.
Um,

379
00:26:22.880 --> 00:26:26.270
the interesting one is in the middle and here you can get somewhere between

380
00:26:26.271 --> 00:26:27.104
seven and eight.

381
00:26:27.500 --> 00:26:32.500
So the four at the end is an index of your cognitive access or access

382
00:26:33.501 --> 00:26:37.430
consciousness capacity.
The one in the middle is an,
uh,

383
00:26:37.431 --> 00:26:41.090
an index of your,
the,
your phenomenal memory.

384
00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:45.780
So it's these two kinds of memory that are an issue here.
Now,

385
00:26:46.770 --> 00:26:50.430
of course,
my opponents think,
oh,

386
00:26:50.431 --> 00:26:54.660
how do we know that that memory is a conscious memory?

387
00:26:54.661 --> 00:26:58.930
Maybe these things are actually unconscious.
And so,
um,

388
00:26:58.950 --> 00:27:02.400
and then when you get the cue,
there's something has summoned up from,

389
00:27:02.580 --> 00:27:05.100
from unconsciousness.
Um,

390
00:27:05.640 --> 00:27:10.240
so what is clear though is that more items can be held in the,
um,

391
00:27:10.350 --> 00:27:14.010
um,
non-conceptual.
So what I think is that these,

392
00:27:14.370 --> 00:27:17.850
that this memory is,
and what's really crucial to these experiments,

393
00:27:17.851 --> 00:27:22.740
it's a non conceptual memory.
Now,
I think that these non-conceptual,
uh,

394
00:27:22.890 --> 00:27:25.440
representations or are conscious,
but,
uh,

395
00:27:25.441 --> 00:27:29.490
I'll have to wait to get to the evidence for that.
So he,
just to remind you,

396
00:27:29.491 --> 00:27:31.010
here are the,
uh,
um,

397
00:27:31.390 --> 00:27:35.970
of the two views and the put in terms of weather,
uh,
um,
uh,

398
00:27:36.210 --> 00:27:40.260
attention.
Um,
it promotes conceptualization is I think,

399
00:27:40.380 --> 00:27:45.090
or whether it is needed for consciousness.
And I should say,
by the way,
um,

400
00:27:46.110 --> 00:27:47.590
which probably people,

401
00:27:47.591 --> 00:27:50.930
something probably people here aren't aware of is which is that,
um,

402
00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:52.080
in recent years,

403
00:27:52.081 --> 00:27:57.081
philosophers have become very tied in with a lot of discussions in um,

404
00:27:58.690 --> 00:28:02.190
uh,
psychology,
neuroscience,
AI.
Um,

405
00:28:02.250 --> 00:28:05.900
and so these people are the disagreements here,

406
00:28:05.901 --> 00:28:09.270
eve equally split between a philosophers and scientists.

407
00:28:09.300 --> 00:28:13.110
Now I've been using this word a concept.

408
00:28:13.830 --> 00:28:18.760
The word concept is actually an ambiguous between,
um,
a sense in which,
um,

409
00:28:18.780 --> 00:28:21.780
it means something that can be shared among many people.

410
00:28:21.781 --> 00:28:24.870
Something kind of abstract that's at the top.
So may meaning like,

411
00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:29.610
or this mental representation sense that was used by the,
for example,

412
00:28:29.611 --> 00:28:33.450
the British in Paris.
So I'm going with the mental representation sense.

413
00:28:33.451 --> 00:28:36.870
It's just a,
I'm just telling you about terminology.
Now,

414
00:28:36.900 --> 00:28:40.620
this notion of a concept is,
um,
often,
um,
uh,

415
00:28:41.250 --> 00:28:45.840
puzzles people.
There's a famous case that helps to illustrate what are,

416
00:28:46.380 --> 00:28:49.490
um,
uh,
on the notion of a concept business.
Uh,
uh,

417
00:28:49.530 --> 00:28:53.160
French philosopher named Bruno Latour who says said that,
um,

418
00:28:53.190 --> 00:28:56.970
Aransas the second could not have died of tuberculosis cause it wasn't

419
00:28:56.971 --> 00:29:01.250
discovered then.
And this is an actual quote before cock,

420
00:29:01.260 --> 00:29:05.160
the Bacillus had no real existence to say that Ramses the second died of

421
00:29:05.161 --> 00:29:09.510
tuberculosis is absurd as saying that he died of machine gun fire.

422
00:29:10.070 --> 00:29:14.490
Um,
and so I quote this part it cause it's kind of funny.
Um,

423
00:29:14.810 --> 00:29:18.810
uh,
but the idea here is that,
um,
it's the,

424
00:29:19.020 --> 00:29:24.020
he's confusing the concept in my sense with what it's a concept of.

425
00:29:25.760 --> 00:29:30.760
And so that helps to illustrate the idea of some of my things aren't displaying

426
00:29:31.411 --> 00:29:35.820
properly,
but what can I do?
So what I think is that the,

427
00:29:36.180 --> 00:29:37.350
um,
that the,

428
00:29:37.351 --> 00:29:42.351
that conscious experience is non-conceptual here is one of many experiments that

429
00:29:42.611 --> 00:29:47.611
suggests that this is an experiment done on a 12 month old babies.

430
00:29:48.280 --> 00:29:49.390
And so there's a screen,

431
00:29:49.391 --> 00:29:52.060
they're looking at the screen and object comes out one side,

432
00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:54.730
a different colored object comes out the other side,

433
00:29:55.030 --> 00:29:57.460
then the screen goes down and the,

434
00:29:57.760 --> 00:30:02.260
the babies do not expect two things.
Okay?

435
00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:05.170
So they don't register color.

436
00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:10.660
It's an interesting thing about color and babies,
but,
um,
uh,
their,
their,

437
00:30:10.661 --> 00:30:14.070
their color vision is fine at four to six months.
They can,
um,
uh,

438
00:30:14.350 --> 00:30:17.680
they have all the basic color discriminations.
If anybody's interested in,

439
00:30:17.681 --> 00:30:22.660
I can explain honey,
tell that.
Um,
but,
um,
uh,
uh,
uh,

440
00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:27.710
they do not use color in reasoning,
uh,

441
00:30:27.730 --> 00:30:32.730
between about four to six months and it's starting maybe like 12 to 18 months.

442
00:30:33.101 --> 00:30:37.120
They start using color and reasoning.
So they're non there.

443
00:30:37.140 --> 00:30:41.740
Their appreciation of color is non-conceptual.
Um,

444
00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:44.800
so yeah,
this is what I just said.
Okay.

445
00:30:44.830 --> 00:30:49.610
I am going to have to get,
okay,
so here is a,

446
00:30:49.611 --> 00:30:54.611
a little kind of brain illustration of some of the ideas that are at issue here.

447
00:30:55.690 --> 00:30:58.600
Um,
so,
um,

448
00:30:58.990 --> 00:31:03.040
this is the back of the head where vision starts,
you know,

449
00:31:03.370 --> 00:31:07.660
the light comes in your eyes.
It um,
um,
uh,

450
00:31:07.750 --> 00:31:12.040
is uh,
the signals are sent through threat retina to the,

451
00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:14.650
something in the middle of your brain,
the lateral geniculate nucleus,

452
00:31:14.651 --> 00:31:18.940
and they go to the first cortical visual areas in the back of your head.

453
00:31:19.690 --> 00:31:24.550
Um,
and uh,
the,
my,
my opponents,

454
00:31:24.790 --> 00:31:25.870
so sorry,

455
00:31:26.140 --> 00:31:29.830
these arrows are indicate attention.

456
00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:34.780
This means that the person is attending to the stimulus,

457
00:31:35.560 --> 00:31:39.340
the Arrow pointing to the back of the head where vision starts his attention to

458
00:31:39.341 --> 00:31:43.750
the stimulus.
So this is a,
um,
um,

459
00:31:43.810 --> 00:31:46.240
an a,
a diagram of a brain.

460
00:31:46.241 --> 00:31:49.990
When somebody is uncontroversially conscious of a stimulus,

461
00:31:50.350 --> 00:31:54.960
the person is attending to it.
There are all these,
um,
uh,
um,

462
00:31:55.170 --> 00:31:57.610
uh,
reciprocal connections,

463
00:31:58.270 --> 00:32:01.600
reciprocal activations going into frontal cortex.

464
00:32:02.020 --> 00:32:05.440
The key here is frontal cortex.
That's where fought reasoning,

465
00:32:05.441 --> 00:32:07.900
decision making live in the brain.

466
00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:13.390
And my opponents think the people who think all consciousness is access

467
00:32:13.391 --> 00:32:17.950
consciousness,
that it's the,
it's that triggering the activation.

468
00:32:17.951 --> 00:32:21.950
It's called ignition that makes the in,
uh,
um,

469
00:32:21.970 --> 00:32:23.830
and that creates these,

470
00:32:24.130 --> 00:32:29.130
these neural correlations with frontal cortex that are the key to a

471
00:32:29.800 --> 00:32:31.410
consciousness.
Um,

472
00:32:32.550 --> 00:32:36.760
here is a undeniably unconscious perception.
No,

473
00:32:36.820 --> 00:32:41.630
there's something called priming.
If you get stimulus,
it affects your later,

474
00:32:41.810 --> 00:32:45.690
uh,
recognition.
So for example,
um,
if I get,

475
00:32:45.770 --> 00:32:49.070
if I have an unconscious,
subliminal presentation of the word doctor,

476
00:32:49.400 --> 00:32:54.170
I'll be quicker to recognize the word nurse as a word.
Um,

477
00:32:54.440 --> 00:32:59.410
if,
uh,
if I've seen it here is the controversial case,
which my opponent,

478
00:32:59.411 --> 00:33:03.350
Stanislaus,
to hone calls preconscious.

479
00:33:03.920 --> 00:33:07.610
And that is where you have attention away from the stimulus.

480
00:33:07.611 --> 00:33:10.070
You get strong loops in the back of the head,

481
00:33:10.071 --> 00:33:13.430
but no reportability unless attention shifts.

482
00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:17.180
So he thinks that's,
um,
uh,
not conscious.

483
00:33:17.181 --> 00:33:19.580
I say that it's probably conscious.

484
00:33:20.030 --> 00:33:22.820
So I'm now going to move to,

485
00:33:23.390 --> 00:33:27.830
maybe I should just quickly explain the global workspace.
Okay.

486
00:33:27.980 --> 00:33:32.810
So this is a diagram from,
um,
uh,
status lost the home,

487
00:33:33.350 --> 00:33:37.430
um,
who is a French cognitive neuroscientist.

488
00:33:37.730 --> 00:33:41.540
And the idea is that these,
the outer circle is the periphery of your body.

489
00:33:42.470 --> 00:33:47.370
These,
uh,
uh,
uh,
nodes are our neural systems.
The links are,

490
00:33:47.730 --> 00:33:52.190
uh,
sis are links between neuro systems.
The field didn't ones are active.

491
00:33:52.460 --> 00:33:57.110
Um,
so here's his idea.
The idea is that you have a,
um,

492
00:33:57.930 --> 00:34:02.800
uh,
you have the sensory surface produces a lot of activations there.

493
00:34:02.810 --> 00:34:07.280
It's a competition among them.
Some of them form active coalitions,

494
00:34:07.460 --> 00:34:12.010
and then they trigger ignition into the frontal lobes.
Um,
when the,

495
00:34:12.080 --> 00:34:16.850
when the,
when the ignition in the frontal lobes makes the,
um,
uh,

496
00:34:16.910 --> 00:34:19.130
the STIMULII conceptualize.

497
00:34:19.131 --> 00:34:22.910
So I've been talking to a lot about the difference between an conceptualists and

498
00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:26.340
conceptualize.
This is a,
uh,
a,
um,
um,
um,

499
00:34:26.420 --> 00:34:31.310
of a theory of what it is to be conceptualized.
Um,
okay,
so here's the,

500
00:34:31.400 --> 00:34:34.790
I'm just going to quickly get to the methodological breakthroughs and I think

501
00:34:34.791 --> 00:34:37.820
I'll only probably be able to do one of them.

502
00:34:39.020 --> 00:34:44.020
So my two hypothesis here are that conceptualize the stimulus requires global

503
00:34:44.121 --> 00:34:47.450
brigade broadcasting.
This is called global broadcasting.

504
00:34:47.490 --> 00:34:52.310
When these active coalitions trigger representations in the front,
um,

505
00:34:52.550 --> 00:34:57.550
hypothesis two is that non-conceptual conscious percepts do not require a global

506
00:34:57.920 --> 00:34:58.753
broadcasting.

507
00:34:59.300 --> 00:35:03.770
So now a method here that I could use,

508
00:35:05.330 --> 00:35:06.770
okay,
maybe I will do this.

509
00:35:08.120 --> 00:35:11.900
So this requires reddened gleen green glasses,
which I happen to walk with me.

510
00:35:12.860 --> 00:35:15.740
Actually,
there's no time to pass it out.
You know,

511
00:35:15.741 --> 00:35:19.850
I'm going to pass these out anyway and then I can come back to it.
Uh,

512
00:35:20.660 --> 00:35:24.770
so yeah.
Yeah.
So please don't touch the red and the green.

513
00:35:26.030 --> 00:35:28.970
Um,
and then I'd like to have those back at the end.

514
00:35:29.270 --> 00:35:32.060
So until those are all passed out,
which is going to be a while,

515
00:35:32.061 --> 00:35:33.500
I'm just going to,
I'm going to go on.

516
00:35:33.650 --> 00:35:36.830
So if you look at this through red and green glasses,
what years,
what you get,

517
00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:41.070
you get first to face then a house,
then a face,

518
00:35:41.160 --> 00:35:46.150
it fills your whole visual field.
Okay.
It's called binocular rivalry.
Those,
uh,

519
00:35:46.310 --> 00:35:49.880
uh,
you have incompatible representations and,
and the,

520
00:35:49.910 --> 00:35:54.880
the processing streams involved in both the two eyes,
Duke it out.
Um,

521
00:35:55.410 --> 00:35:58.520
and interestingly you can,
um,

522
00:35:58.890 --> 00:36:03.090
this is a terrific thing for studying consciousness because you have an

523
00:36:03.120 --> 00:36:07.500
unchanging input with changing conscious percept.

524
00:36:08.430 --> 00:36:10.800
Um,
so,
uh,

525
00:36:10.860 --> 00:36:15.480
and that's a lot of people to identify some areas that are more active when

526
00:36:15.481 --> 00:36:19.830
you're conscious like the fusiform face area of a face and other is that are

527
00:36:19.831 --> 00:36:23.160
active,
more active.
When you're conscious of sale a house,

528
00:36:23.970 --> 00:36:26.790
these things have,
um,
um,

529
00:36:26.940 --> 00:36:30.090
if you ask people to report whether they see a face or a house,

530
00:36:30.450 --> 00:36:35.450
what you get is frontal and parietal links being the key thing here.

531
00:36:35.461 --> 00:36:40.380
And that that has been taken to support the global workspace idea.
Um,

532
00:36:41.250 --> 00:36:43.500
however,
mmm

533
00:36:45.240 --> 00:36:50.240
eye movements can be validated as a measure of consciousness.

534
00:36:51.330 --> 00:36:56.280
So the key here,
this is what's called a,
uh,
no report method.

535
00:36:56.310 --> 00:36:57.720
So here's the problem.

536
00:36:57.960 --> 00:37:02.790
Reports are an index of phenomenal consciousness.

537
00:37:02.890 --> 00:37:04.710
You know,
if you say you saw it,
probably you did see it,

538
00:37:05.010 --> 00:37:07.140
they're also in an exit access consciousness.

539
00:37:07.200 --> 00:37:10.270
How can you use reports to distinguish between phenomenal couch,

540
00:37:10.290 --> 00:37:13.380
an access conscious?
It seems impossible.
People have said it's impossible.

541
00:37:13.620 --> 00:37:16.470
However,
whenever people say something's impossible,

542
00:37:17.160 --> 00:37:21.780
it's a dangerous thing because clever experimenters can find a way to make it

543
00:37:21.781 --> 00:37:23.550
possible.
And that's happened here.

544
00:37:24.840 --> 00:37:29.820
So in an article,
um,
from um,
uh,
Volk Kang,

545
00:37:29.880 --> 00:37:32.730
I now as a group in 2014,
by the way,

546
00:37:32.910 --> 00:37:35.860
I should say that the experiments to the extended,

547
00:37:35.890 --> 00:37:39.150
I'm going to get a chance to go through these experiments are all,

548
00:37:39.550 --> 00:37:41.100
are very recent experiments.

549
00:37:41.101 --> 00:37:46.101
This is an area that is exploding in what people are finding out.

550
00:37:47.160 --> 00:37:51.150
And my approach to the hard problem is,
um,
you know,

551
00:37:51.151 --> 00:37:54.160
nobody can think of an answer to the hard problem.
Um,

552
00:37:54.300 --> 00:37:58.950
but that may be because of the failure of imagination and the way to sort of,

553
00:37:59.280 --> 00:38:00.870
you know,
um,

554
00:38:00.990 --> 00:38:05.730
a juice up your imagination is to figure out how the easy problem works,

555
00:38:06.150 --> 00:38:09.240
how these states affect other states.

556
00:38:09.570 --> 00:38:13.170
And maybe by doing that we'll be able to solve the hard problem anyway.

557
00:38:13.171 --> 00:38:18.010
So when I knows there's lab,
um,
found was that if,
oh,

558
00:38:18.070 --> 00:38:22.470
so does everybody have the uh,
the Renton glasses?
Oh,

559
00:38:22.500 --> 00:38:27.000
whatever happened to them.
Oh,

560
00:38:27.990 --> 00:38:32.310
oh,
I'm sorry.
What,
what?
They're all distributed.
Oh,

561
00:38:32.370 --> 00:38:36.160
I'm sorry.
Well,
okay,
so look,
just going to show you this.
Those

562
00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:39.370
<v 1>of you have them,
I just want to make sure people see</v>

563
00:38:44.030 --> 00:38:46.600
<v 0>I'm,
it takes a little while.
So you may,</v>

564
00:38:47.440 --> 00:38:52.440
what you should be seeing if this is working properly is alternating house face

565
00:38:53.351 --> 00:38:56.710
house faced,
unless you have a very,
very dominant eye.

566
00:38:58.110 --> 00:39:02.940
How many are seeing that?
Raise your hand if you're seeing the alternation.

567
00:39:02.970 --> 00:39:05.310
Okay.
Oh good.
Okay.

568
00:39:07.170 --> 00:39:11.830
I'm sorry I didn't bring enough.
Okay,

569
00:39:11.831 --> 00:39:16.270
so I'm going to go back to this thing.
Okay.
So,

570
00:39:16.840 --> 00:39:17.261
all right.

571
00:39:17.261 --> 00:39:22.261
So if you do the binocular rivalry with a grid moving one way and one eye and a

572
00:39:23.351 --> 00:39:24.640
grid move in the other way,

573
00:39:24.641 --> 00:39:29.641
the other one turns out there's a nice index of what you are conscious of.

574
00:39:31.721 --> 00:39:35.860
And that index is called opto kinetic Nystagmus.

575
00:39:35.861 --> 00:39:37.240
And this is what the eye does.

576
00:39:39.640 --> 00:39:44.640
The eye movements indicate which thing you are conscious of and it can be shown

577
00:39:47.771 --> 00:39:51.610
using people's reports that they correlate pretty well.

578
00:39:52.060 --> 00:39:55.770
But now there's this cool thing.
You've got a re,
uh,

579
00:39:56.020 --> 00:40:01.020
an index of what people are experiencing and know you can show them the original

580
00:40:02.501 --> 00:40:05.980
stimuli and don't ask them to report.
Okay,

581
00:40:06.730 --> 00:40:11.290
no report paradigm.
Okay,
so here's what is found out.

582
00:40:13.020 --> 00:40:13.853
<v 1>MMM.</v>

583
00:40:14.840 --> 00:40:17.180
<v 0>So here's a quotation from the article.
Importantly,</v>

584
00:40:17.181 --> 00:40:21.950
when observers passively experienced rivalry without reporting perceptual

585
00:40:21.951 --> 00:40:22.784
originations,

586
00:40:23.170 --> 00:40:26.690
a different picture that it's a different picture from the global workspace idea

587
00:40:27.230 --> 00:40:28.980
emerged.
Um,

588
00:40:29.480 --> 00:40:33.290
differential neural activity in frontal areas was absent.

589
00:40:33.291 --> 00:40:37.820
Whereas activation in the back of the head and the middle of the head
persistent,

590
00:40:38.180 --> 00:40:43.180
we conclude that frontal areas are associated with active report and

591
00:40:43.371 --> 00:40:45.740
introspection.
Okay?

592
00:40:45.741 --> 00:40:48.380
So contradicting some of these earlier things.

593
00:40:48.770 --> 00:40:53.700
Now I have a lot more on this experiment,
which I'm not going to go into.
Um,

594
00:40:53.750 --> 00:40:54.770
but uh,
you know,

595
00:40:54.771 --> 00:40:58.970
I was very pleased to see this because of course it backs up my view.

596
00:41:00.020 --> 00:41:02.960
What I'm,
as you know,
Eric and I talked to her lunch.

597
00:41:03.300 --> 00:41:07.390
I of course I'm very most,
what I'm most interested in is finding,
you know,
is,

598
00:41:07.530 --> 00:41:10.670
is getting,
uh,
uh,
uh,
uh,
a leg up on the truth,

599
00:41:10.880 --> 00:41:15.080
but have an independent interest in seeing my own views confirmed.

600
00:41:15.450 --> 00:41:17.280
And this did it.
Um,

601
00:41:17.450 --> 00:41:22.450
and quite a lot of these experiments have actually confirmed,

602
00:41:22.910 --> 00:41:24.830
confirm,
uh,
my picture of this,

603
00:41:24.840 --> 00:41:27.980
which I had been pushing for a really long time.

604
00:41:28.430 --> 00:41:33.140
So let me quickly switch to a different one.
So I'm,

605
00:41:33.350 --> 00:41:38.350
there's this longer talk involves three different techniques for avoiding the

606
00:41:38.481 --> 00:41:41.120
probe.
But let me just explain.
The problem I'm trying to avoid,

607
00:41:41.330 --> 00:41:45.440
the problem is both views me,
this is mine,

608
00:41:45.470 --> 00:41:49.460
this is my opponents.
Both of them end up with sparse cognition.

609
00:41:50.150 --> 00:41:55.150
So it seems that the basis of theorizing in reports is going to be the same in

610
00:41:57.561 --> 00:42:00.740
either case.
So that's the puzzle.

611
00:42:01.160 --> 00:42:05.120
And then the one I just showed you is a way around it.
It's called no report.

612
00:42:05.121 --> 00:42:09.140
But of course reports we've got to be in there somewhere in the case.

613
00:42:09.141 --> 00:42:12.620
I just showed you the reports come before the experiment.

614
00:42:13.520 --> 00:42:14.600
The one I'm going to show you now,

615
00:42:14.601 --> 00:42:19.601
the reports come after the experiment and I'll just do this very briefly.

616
00:42:21.220 --> 00:42:26.210
Um,
this uses,
um,
um,
somebody called event related potential,

617
00:42:26.211 --> 00:42:30.230
which is a,
um,
a form of EEG.

618
00:42:30.620 --> 00:42:32.810
And then the idea here is this is my,

619
00:42:32.840 --> 00:42:36.500
my opponent Stanislaus to hon one of my photos.

620
00:42:37.670 --> 00:42:39.710
I'll just,
I won't explain this whole diagram,

621
00:42:39.711 --> 00:42:44.660
but the idea here is this looks at the differences between seen things and

622
00:42:44.720 --> 00:42:49.220
unseen things.
He means consciously scene and not consciously scene.

623
00:42:49.550 --> 00:42:54.550
And you only start to get a separation at about 270 milliseconds to 300

624
00:42:54.711 --> 00:42:55.550
milliseconds.

625
00:42:56.000 --> 00:43:00.890
So you can use temporal differences to get at whether it's a conscious

626
00:43:00.891 --> 00:43:05.600
perception or not on the global workspace point of view.
So here's the technique.

627
00:43:05.601 --> 00:43:08.960
This is work done by Michael Pitts,
um,

628
00:43:09.710 --> 00:43:13.970
at Reed College.
Um,
so the paradigm is this.

629
00:43:13.971 --> 00:43:18.080
You have a ring,
uh,
with these discs in it,

630
00:43:18.081 --> 00:43:22.790
and the task is to detect a disk,
be dimming.

631
00:43:23.540 --> 00:43:28.460
Okay.
And,
and that focuses your attention on the periphery of the screen,

632
00:43:29.450 --> 00:43:32.210
right?
Because it's a very difficult task.
He'd,

633
00:43:32.270 --> 00:43:35.540
he calibrates it to be extremely difficult.
Um,

634
00:43:36.050 --> 00:43:39.860
in the meanwhile,
while the that's going on,

635
00:43:39.950 --> 00:43:44.810
there's constantly changing lines in the middle.
Um,
uh,

636
00:43:45.020 --> 00:43:49.250
so here's a,
an example of a square that occurs in the middle.

637
00:43:50.150 --> 00:43:54.320
Um,
and he's,
he set this up so that only about half the subjects notice it.

638
00:43:55.250 --> 00:43:59.450
So what he does here is the first stage,

639
00:43:59.451 --> 00:44:01.490
which is probably the most significant one,

640
00:44:02.060 --> 00:44:07.060
is he does 240 trials of this dimming detecting thing.

641
00:44:08.450 --> 00:44:12.920
Um,
and then ask people afterwards whether they saw a figure.

642
00:44:13.720 --> 00:44:18.150
Um,
and what he finds is that if they,
the,

643
00:44:18.590 --> 00:44:20.510
the heat has a long detailed questionnaire.

644
00:44:20.511 --> 00:44:24.530
He shows him various possible examples of what the figure might've been.

645
00:44:24.800 --> 00:44:29.000
And so he's,
he's trying really hard to rule out guessing and other things.

646
00:44:29.420 --> 00:44:30.253
Um,

647
00:44:30.350 --> 00:44:35.350
so what he finds is that conscious experience correlates with,

648
00:44:36.790 --> 00:44:37.623
uh,
um,

649
00:44:37.860 --> 00:44:42.860
activations earlier than the global workspace at about maybe 200 to 250

650
00:44:43.861 --> 00:44:47.070
milliseconds.
So it's this temporal difference.
So again,

651
00:44:47.071 --> 00:44:50.680
this supports my view and I'll,
I'll just,
uh,
um,
uh,

652
00:44:51.150 --> 00:44:56.070
quote some of the what,
what he says here.
I won't show you the whole experiment.

653
00:44:56.780 --> 00:44:58.950
Um,
but here's what he says.
He says,

654
00:44:58.951 --> 00:45:03.020
the pattern results suggest that the neural events reflected in,

655
00:45:03.030 --> 00:45:07.460
and this is this n d one and d two is this stuff right here.
Um,

656
00:45:08.100 --> 00:45:11.250
maybe adequate in themselves to produce visual awareness,

657
00:45:11.251 --> 00:45:16.110
whereas more widespread activity indexed and these things which occurs at 400 to

658
00:45:16.111 --> 00:45:17.310
600 milliseconds,

659
00:45:17.700 --> 00:45:21.300
might be required only when the stimulation need to be processed further to

660
00:45:21.301 --> 00:45:23.100
fulfill the goals of the task at hand.

661
00:45:23.310 --> 00:45:26.550
This dissension parallels that made by previous theorists between phenomenal

662
00:45:26.551 --> 00:45:30.120
consciousness,
an access consciousness.
So this is the first of,

663
00:45:30.121 --> 00:45:32.940
is of many experiments that supports this point of view.

664
00:45:33.240 --> 00:45:36.760
And I won't go into all the details,
but he,
he,
what he shows in the,

665
00:45:36.761 --> 00:45:40.320
in this work is that,
um,
it's reporting,

666
00:45:40.560 --> 00:45:43.560
it's the cognitive processes underlying we porting and,

667
00:45:43.860 --> 00:45:48.780
and conceptualizing that lead to global workspace activation.

668
00:45:49.530 --> 00:45:53.400
And,
uh,
okay.
Um,

669
00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:55.290
so,
um,

670
00:45:55.830 --> 00:46:00.540
so according to this is a 2014 book by one of my opponents,

671
00:46:00.541 --> 00:46:04.920
then it's lost to Hahn who says when the prefrontal cortex does not gain access

672
00:46:04.921 --> 00:46:08.680
to the messenger,
cannot be broadly shared and therefore remains unconscious.

673
00:46:08.730 --> 00:46:13.140
What I think is that that's an conceptualized,
but in many cases conscious.

674
00:46:13.500 --> 00:46:16.500
So just to sum up,
um,

675
00:46:17.430 --> 00:46:21.390
the evidence for rich conscious perception,
um,
uh,

676
00:46:21.900 --> 00:46:26.190
stems from these delayed indicators from eye movements.

677
00:46:26.490 --> 00:46:29.670
And I didn't get a chance to do the ones about just judgments.

678
00:46:30.030 --> 00:46:34.920
And so the idea is that,
uh,
um,
the,
um,

679
00:46:35.280 --> 00:46:39.630
well I haven't really justified this,
but anyway,
do the thought is that,
um,

680
00:46:40.110 --> 00:46:41.070
um,
uh,

681
00:46:41.280 --> 00:46:46.280
phenomenal consciousness probably is not as informational kind of thing as a

682
00:46:48.300 --> 00:46:50.540
access consciousness.
And,
uh,

683
00:46:50.541 --> 00:46:55.541
so I think it's likely to resist a computer approaches and I'm just going to

684
00:46:55.930 --> 00:46:56.763
stop

685
00:46:59.340 --> 00:47:01.820
<v 1>[inaudible].</v>

686
00:47:03.310 --> 00:47:06.280
<v 0>So questions.
And they would like you to use the microphone.</v>

687
00:47:06.970 --> 00:47:08.770
Maybe somebody can hand the microphone around.

688
00:47:12.340 --> 00:47:15.790
Sorry.
There was a little quick kind of run through some of the,
some stuff.

689
00:47:19.250 --> 00:47:20.083
<v 1>Hmm.</v>

690
00:47:20.820 --> 00:47:25.200
<v 3>Okay.
Thanks.
Um,
I have a question with,
um,
with the trials that you had mentioned.</v>

691
00:47:25.450 --> 00:47:25.730
Um,

692
00:47:25.730 --> 00:47:30.730
I wonder if you see differences or how do I ask this so that the trial seems to

693
00:47:31.251 --> 00:47:33.910
assume that people are always the same,
but like some,

694
00:47:33.911 --> 00:47:36.090
like I'm kinda tired right now,
like it's Monday.

695
00:47:36.100 --> 00:47:41.100
So maybe the way that I would perform with a given trial now if I'm hungry,

696
00:47:41.891 --> 00:47:43.960
if I'm not hungry.
Like how,
how does that,

697
00:47:43.961 --> 00:47:48.961
like the reality of like the body and outside forces influence or not influence

698
00:47:50.031 --> 00:47:51.400
the consciousness trials.
Yeah.

699
00:47:51.840 --> 00:47:54.930
<v 0>Okay.
So it all experiments,
that's a problem.</v>

700
00:47:55.170 --> 00:47:58.230
There's going to be a lot of variance,
you know,
just treat it as noise really.

701
00:47:58.590 --> 00:48:02.900
It's ways in which the,
you will not get uniformity of response,
uh,

702
00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:07.640
because of variation and all kinds of things to do with people.
Um,
and,
uh,

703
00:48:07.650 --> 00:48:11.940
there's,
you know,
you just have to deal with the noise in the data,
but it is a,

704
00:48:11.941 --> 00:48:13.230
it is a persistent problem.

705
00:48:16.140 --> 00:48:19.840
<v 3>Hi.
Um,
I wonder back to the title,
uh,</v>

706
00:48:20.120 --> 00:48:24.780
so I wonder y two k summarize why the artificial intelligence approach won't

707
00:48:25.350 --> 00:48:28.040
work for the expansion of consciousness and why.

708
00:48:28.520 --> 00:48:31.970
<v 0>Yeah.
The thought,
well,
I didn't really get into this.
Uh,
um,
uh,</v>

709
00:48:32.030 --> 00:48:35.150
but the thought behind it is that,
um,
that are,

710
00:48:35.151 --> 00:48:38.120
the artificial intelligence approaches are probably better for access

711
00:48:38.121 --> 00:48:40.460
consciousness then phenomenal consciousness.

712
00:48:40.461 --> 00:48:44.930
This idea of global broadcasting and um,
seems more,

713
00:48:44.960 --> 00:48:48.830
um,
amenable.
You know,
it's information flow basically.
Where's,

714
00:48:48.831 --> 00:48:52.550
what's going on in phenomenal consciousness seems somewhat different from

715
00:48:52.551 --> 00:48:55.850
information flow.
It seems maybe to involve,
you know,

716
00:48:55.851 --> 00:48:58.460
biochemical mechanisms in the brain.
I mean,

717
00:48:58.461 --> 00:49:01.080
we don't know what the nature of fa normal consciousness is.

718
00:49:01.090 --> 00:49:06.090
So I guess maybe what I should really say is there is a possibility that,

719
00:49:07.220 --> 00:49:07.491
um,

720
00:49:07.491 --> 00:49:11.420
information methods based on the flow of information we'll work for phenomenal

721
00:49:11.421 --> 00:49:12.254
consciousness.

722
00:49:12.770 --> 00:49:17.770
It is certainly true that advances to do with phenomenal culture to seem to be

723
00:49:18.531 --> 00:49:23.210
coming from neuroscience rather than from computer science or artificial

724
00:49:23.211 --> 00:49:27.080
intelligence.
You know,
one of the hopes,
I mean,

725
00:49:27.081 --> 00:49:30.620
one of the points that people have made about the global workspace viewpoint,

726
00:49:30.680 --> 00:49:34.970
the one I've been arguing against is that it's in principle implementable on a

727
00:49:34.971 --> 00:49:35.804
machine.

728
00:49:36.110 --> 00:49:40.130
So people who are interested in machine consciousness had been very happy with

729
00:49:40.131 --> 00:49:41.360
the global workspace idea.

730
00:49:41.361 --> 00:49:45.080
So to the extent that I am arguing against the global workspace idea,

731
00:49:45.650 --> 00:49:47.240
I'm arguing against the,

732
00:49:47.241 --> 00:49:50.450
at least the standard kind of computer approach to consciousness.

733
00:49:52.190 --> 00:49:57.170
<v 3>Your mind,
can we imagine or is a DVD that machines can get consciousness?</v>

734
00:49:57.890 --> 00:50:02.180
<v 0>Yeah,
I think,
look,
I think we're conscious machines.
So I'm,
you know,</v>

735
00:50:02.300 --> 00:50:03.950
we're meeting machines.
I,
I'm,

736
00:50:04.010 --> 00:50:08.660
I'm not only kind of a dual list or anything like that,
um,
but I think that,

737
00:50:09.290 --> 00:50:10.123
um,

738
00:50:10.190 --> 00:50:15.190
the most obvious application of theoretical approaches to consciousness from a

739
00:50:18.891 --> 00:50:22.530
machine point of view haven't panned out.
Um,

740
00:50:22.760 --> 00:50:26.750
I haven't mentioned really there's a lot of other more machine friendly

741
00:50:27.200 --> 00:50:31.630
approaches.
So,
um,
you know,
some of them may look,

742
00:50:31.640 --> 00:50:33.680
depends what kind of machine,
when we're talking about I,

743
00:50:33.710 --> 00:50:38.510
my feeling is that we may need some kind of analog processes to deal with

744
00:50:38.511 --> 00:50:43.130
consciousness,
but you know,
this is initial stages of a approach to it.

745
00:50:44.050 --> 00:50:44.820
<v 1>Okay.</v>

746
00:50:44.820 --> 00:50:47.520
<v 4>So I'm not entirely sure I'd ask this question and it's a very recommend you
buy.</v>

747
00:50:47.730 --> 00:50:51.030
It seemed like a lot of the things you were examining in terms of what

748
00:50:51.031 --> 00:50:54.510
constituted conscious awareness of information or conceptualization of

749
00:50:54.511 --> 00:50:56.340
information in or uh,
you know,

750
00:50:56.341 --> 00:50:59.070
unconscious or preconscious conceptual visionary attraction,

751
00:50:59.100 --> 00:51:03.860
your recognition of information all kind of had to do with a sense that there's

752
00:51:03.870 --> 00:51:07.950
sort of like,
like one place,
like where consciousness is happening,

753
00:51:07.951 --> 00:51:11.670
like catches is all kind of one singular like sort of Cartesian process.

754
00:51:12.210 --> 00:51:14.130
And like if that's not true,

755
00:51:14.131 --> 00:51:17.250
what implication would that have for these questions?
You know,

756
00:51:17.251 --> 00:51:20.070
is it possible that these might all be irrelevant questions to consciousness or

757
00:51:20.080 --> 00:51:20.581
overall?

758
00:51:20.581 --> 00:51:22.800
And I'm really a question of where information and happens to be in the brain at

759
00:51:22.801 --> 00:51:23.634
any given point.

760
00:51:24.180 --> 00:51:28.330
<v 0>Yeah.
So,
I definitely do not think there is a place in the brain month.</v>

761
00:51:28.410 --> 00:51:30.000
One of my opponents,

762
00:51:30.001 --> 00:51:33.720
Daniel Dennett has used that to caricature my position.

763
00:51:33.721 --> 00:51:37.110
He calls it the Cartesian theater.
Um,

764
00:51:37.350 --> 00:51:41.120
so I think that our best guests about you,

765
00:51:41.200 --> 00:51:46.200
like where are the brain consciousness happens is that every conscious content

766
00:51:46.770 --> 00:51:50.970
is processed by the area that processes that kind of information.

767
00:51:51.570 --> 00:51:54.750
So for example,
um,
conscious,
um,
uh,

768
00:51:54.751 --> 00:51:59.751
contents of motion have to do with uh,

769
00:51:59.920 --> 00:52:04.800
activations in that area empty probably they involve um,

770
00:52:04.860 --> 00:52:09.810
um,
a reciprocal connections to lower visual areas,
conscious,

771
00:52:09.900 --> 00:52:10.740
um,
uh,

772
00:52:10.741 --> 00:52:14.520
appreciation of faces probably has to do with activation and this thing called

773
00:52:14.521 --> 00:52:17.400
the fusiform face area at the bottom of your right temporal lobe.

774
00:52:17.820 --> 00:52:20.850
So I don't think there's any place where they come together.

775
00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:25.620
The closest thing to a place I like to distinguish between what makes a content,

776
00:52:26.580 --> 00:52:27.413
um,
uh,

777
00:52:27.870 --> 00:52:32.100
between the difference between different conscious contents like face and and

778
00:52:32.130 --> 00:52:32.963
motion.

779
00:52:33.570 --> 00:52:37.830
I like to distinguish that question from what makes those contents conscious a

780
00:52:37.831 --> 00:52:41.760
matter.
That has been explored by studying,
for example,
anesthesia.

781
00:52:42.570 --> 00:52:45.200
And it looks like there's some kind of general conductivity,

782
00:52:45.210 --> 00:52:49.500
especially going back to this thing in the middle of the brain called the fellow

783
00:52:49.501 --> 00:52:53.580
amiss.
People used to speak of a thalamic switch.

784
00:52:53.940 --> 00:52:58.320
So the closest thing to like a place where it all happens might be that.

785
00:52:58.321 --> 00:53:00.770
But I don't think that's what explains the difference.

786
00:53:00.960 --> 00:53:04.710
Difference between conscious of a face and consciousness of motion.

787
00:53:05.010 --> 00:53:09.660
It's more like a a,
and you know,
something in the direction of an on off switch.

788
00:53:10.690 --> 00:53:15.230
<v 1>Thank you.
Hey,</v>

789
00:53:16.020 --> 00:53:17.340
<v 0>maybe a silly question,</v>

790
00:53:17.341 --> 00:53:21.240
but I noticed all of your example is in this we're done with people.
Yeah.

791
00:53:21.360 --> 00:53:24.330
What about animals?
Like,
yeah.
Okay.

792
00:53:24.331 --> 00:53:29.331
So there a big revolution in the study of consciousness in the mid 1990s when,

793
00:53:30.600 --> 00:53:32.000
um,
uh,

794
00:53:32.040 --> 00:53:37.040
Francis Crick the Nobel Prize winning biologist and Christof Koch realized you

795
00:53:37.741 --> 00:53:40.590
could approach consciousness through studying animals.

796
00:53:40.950 --> 00:53:45.900
And a lot of the work is with animals.
Uh,
you know,
it happened that,
uh,

797
00:53:46.290 --> 00:53:49.850
uh,
actually I skipped something that was about needing meant val subjects were

798
00:53:49.860 --> 00:53:54.090
monkeys.
But a lot of the work is in animals.
And,
uh,

799
00:53:54.091 --> 00:53:58.570
I think there's every reason to believe that our primate cousins,
um,

800
00:53:58.710 --> 00:54:02.340
are just as conscious as we are.
Um,
uh,
you know,

801
00:54:02.341 --> 00:54:06.360
it used to be before about 20 years ago that people thought of consciousness in

802
00:54:06.361 --> 00:54:07.710
terms of language.

803
00:54:08.370 --> 00:54:13.110
And I think that access consciousness was,
you know,
what they had in mind.

804
00:54:13.410 --> 00:54:16.440
And I think one of the things that's happened in the last 20 years is people

805
00:54:16.441 --> 00:54:20.730
have realized that language really doesn't have much to do with it.
So yeah,

806
00:54:20.731 --> 00:54:23.000
there's a lot of work on conscious with animals.

807
00:54:23.020 --> 00:54:25.770
Course it's easier to get reports from people.
So,
um,

808
00:54:25.980 --> 00:54:30.930
but there's been really some surprising work with animals where you can really

809
00:54:30.931 --> 00:54:34.550
get at what they,
uh,
um,
uh,
you know,
what,

810
00:54:34.640 --> 00:54:39.420
what they're experiencing through nonverbal methods.
Okay.
Thank you.

811
00:54:40.010 --> 00:54:40.540
Hi.

812
00:54:40.540 --> 00:54:40.850
<v 2>I mean,</v>

813
00:54:40.850 --> 00:54:45.810
if you suppose we had a synapse level simulation at the full human brain,

814
00:54:46.330 --> 00:54:49.910
which I'd argue we might just be 15 years away from her.
So,
um,

815
00:54:50.100 --> 00:54:53.040
with this simulation and exhibit phenomenal consciousness,

816
00:54:53.250 --> 00:54:57.030
<v 0>uh,
well that's something that people have argued about.</v>

817
00:54:57.031 --> 00:55:02.031
So one common point is that a simulation of a rainstorm isn't wet.

818
00:55:04.020 --> 00:55:07.620
And maybe a simulation of a conscious being isn't conscious either.

819
00:55:08.130 --> 00:55:11.040
So this all goes back to the issue,
which we don't know about,

820
00:55:11.041 --> 00:55:13.320
but which could be true.

821
00:55:13.560 --> 00:55:18.030
That consciousness essentially involves something to do with the neural

822
00:55:18.031 --> 00:55:22.770
processes that are going on brains,
some kind of analog thing.
Um,

823
00:55:22.771 --> 00:55:26.790
and that,
uh,
without an analog devices that sort,

824
00:55:27.030 --> 00:55:30.360
you're not going to get conscious sore example.
Um,
uh,

825
00:55:30.420 --> 00:55:32.100
signals in neurons are electrical,

826
00:55:32.101 --> 00:55:37.101
but the neurons communicate via chemicals that go across the synapse.

827
00:55:37.890 --> 00:55:40.170
Maybe that's part of what's needed for consciousness.

828
00:55:40.200 --> 00:55:44.510
Maybe if you don't have you,
maybe you could make an artificial synapse.
Well,

829
00:55:44.550 --> 00:55:46.200
the people have made artificial synapses,

830
00:55:46.201 --> 00:55:50.100
but you maybe you'd have to use a neurotransmitter's for it to really have

831
00:55:50.101 --> 00:55:52.170
genuine consciousness.
This is the thing,

832
00:55:52.500 --> 00:55:56.880
we don't really know what its most basic level consciousness is.

833
00:55:56.881 --> 00:55:58.320
So we don't know the answer to that

834
00:56:02.440 --> 00:56:03.180
follow up,

835
00:56:03.180 --> 00:56:07.410
<v 2>uh,
to that,
to not knowing what consciousness is.
Um,</v>

836
00:56:07.440 --> 00:56:11.400
what attempts have been made to attack this question from the point of,

837
00:56:11.490 --> 00:56:13.530
instead of asking what is consciousness asking,

838
00:56:13.710 --> 00:56:18.200
why is consciousness speculating why it evolved even?

839
00:56:18.520 --> 00:56:23.500
<v 0>Yeah.
Okay.
Well,
a lot of people have,
have PR have tried to,
you know,</v>

840
00:56:23.720 --> 00:56:28.030
to answer that,
of course it's a little hard to know,
you know,
look,
evolution,

841
00:56:28.480 --> 00:56:31.350
evolutionary reasoning,
you know,
there's,
it's famous for the so called,
you know,

842
00:56:31.360 --> 00:56:35.310
just so stories,
uh,
and to use,
uh,

843
00:56:35.380 --> 00:56:39.260
Stephen Jay Gould phrase.
Um,
but there,

844
00:56:39.430 --> 00:56:43.840
there are all sorts of hypotheses,
um,
about,
you know,
why we have consciousness.

845
00:56:44.080 --> 00:56:48.940
It's obviously doing something for us,
you know,
um,
whether,

846
00:56:49.130 --> 00:56:54.040
you know,
here are some possibilities,
maybe it's motivational.
So,

847
00:56:54.160 --> 00:56:57.550
you know,
positive consciousness,
pleasure,
pain.

848
00:56:58.090 --> 00:57:00.350
Maybe it is some,

849
00:57:00.370 --> 00:57:05.370
it's a way of organizing attention or has something to do with interactions with

850
00:57:06.311 --> 00:57:10.660
attention.
Um,
so they're all,
there's no shortage of speculations,

851
00:57:10.661 --> 00:57:13.390
but you know,
it's,
I don't think anybody knows.

852
00:57:16.940 --> 00:57:19.620
<v 2>Can you describe again the Dra?
I was a bit confused.</v>

853
00:57:19.621 --> 00:57:24.621
The difference between a kind of conscious perception and conscious perception

854
00:57:25.351 --> 00:57:28.440
that is not quite centralized,
which is basically the thing where,

855
00:57:28.740 --> 00:57:33.030
and also once you do that,
discuss a bit kind of the consequences.
Like what,

856
00:57:33.120 --> 00:57:37.740
what would that mean if one theory is towards the,
yeah.
Okay.
So a good,

857
00:57:37.830 --> 00:57:40.680
um,
uh,
index.
So this is the

858
00:57:41.910 --> 00:57:44.790
<v 0>babies perception of color.
Okay?</v>

859
00:57:44.791 --> 00:57:47.160
So you've got this six month old baby.

860
00:57:47.670 --> 00:57:52.440
It's color discriminations are almost at the level of,
uh,

861
00:57:52.520 --> 00:57:56.700
uh,
of an adult.
Um,
and the way you can tell that for example,

862
00:57:56.760 --> 00:58:00.660
is if you have a,
a,
um,

863
00:58:00.780 --> 00:58:05.760
a colored background and a different color disk,

864
00:58:06.660 --> 00:58:07.870
a baby looking at that or,

865
00:58:07.890 --> 00:58:11.160
and an adult looking at that will tend to move their eyes to the disk if they

866
00:58:11.161 --> 00:58:13.680
can see the difference.
So that isn't,

867
00:58:13.710 --> 00:58:17.040
gives you an as one method is a number of methods of finding this out.

868
00:58:17.280 --> 00:58:21.150
That's one method that tells you that baby's distinguished between colors pretty

869
00:58:21.151 --> 00:58:25.920
much the way we do,
uh,
after about six,
four to six months,
however,

870
00:58:25.950 --> 00:58:29.340
they cannot use colors in reasoning.

871
00:58:29.880 --> 00:58:32.860
So here's an example experiment.
Um,

872
00:58:34.410 --> 00:58:39.350
if babies are very interested in movement and noise,
if you,
um,

873
00:58:39.420 --> 00:58:43.710
um,
uh,
and you can,
uh,
uh,
they can,
so you a display,

874
00:58:43.711 --> 00:58:48.480
this is a done by genre.
Me Hawkman you have a display where I,
wonderful,

875
00:58:48.481 --> 00:58:51.150
noisy puppet thing.
The twirls around.

876
00:58:51.151 --> 00:58:53.100
We'll either occur on the left or the right.

877
00:58:53.940 --> 00:58:56.430
If you see two identical shapes,

878
00:58:57.120 --> 00:59:02.120
then you can set it up so that it's on the left and the baby will notice that

879
00:59:02.671 --> 00:59:07.530
regularity and to unethical shapes look at the left because there's gonna be

880
00:59:07.531 --> 00:59:11.730
something great there.
What about two identical colors on the left?

881
00:59:12.060 --> 00:59:14.310
I can't do it.
They can't,

882
00:59:14.520 --> 00:59:19.520
they don't register colors in a way that allows them to use them in reasoning.

883
00:59:22.220 --> 00:59:23.930
That's what concepts are about.

884
00:59:23.960 --> 00:59:28.730
They're about reasoning and thinking and decision making and evaluating.

885
00:59:29.150 --> 00:59:33.410
They just can't do it.
So,
um,
and in fact,

886
00:59:33.411 --> 00:59:38.060
babies don't even learn the four basic color words until they're three years,

887
00:59:38.061 --> 00:59:41.810
three months old.
Um,
an experiment done by Michael,

888
00:59:41.840 --> 00:59:46.340
but by Mabel rice in the 1980s took kids who did not know that it's between red

889
00:59:46.341 --> 00:59:48.400
and green,
sorry,

890
00:59:48.410 --> 00:59:51.590
do not know the words for red and green and tried to teach them the words red

891
00:59:51.591 --> 00:59:54.380
and green is the three year olds.

892
00:59:55.370 --> 01:00:00.340
She had to go through a thousand trials to get kids to,
to um,

893
01:00:00.470 --> 01:00:03.590
uh,
learn the red green contracts.

894
01:00:03.591 --> 01:00:07.190
The typical thing is once they learn one color word,
they learned them all.

895
01:00:07.670 --> 01:00:12.230
Because you know,
there's,
there's been a lot of experiment to work on this,

896
01:00:12.231 --> 01:00:14.810
but basically what we're dealing with is a creature,

897
01:00:14.890 --> 01:00:19.890
namely the human baby that does not register color in a way that allows them to

898
01:00:22.431 --> 01:00:26.570
conceptualize it.
It's non consumption.
I think all perception is like that.

899
01:00:26.990 --> 01:00:31.980
It's that it's most fundamental level.
It's non-conceptual it,
it,

900
01:00:32.320 --> 01:00:32.650
it,

901
01:00:32.650 --> 01:00:36.620
it sometimes they're automatically conceptualism and it gets into our conceptual

902
01:00:36.621 --> 01:00:39.830
system.
But would you have to realize is the perceptual and the,

903
01:00:39.950 --> 01:00:43.190
and the cognitive or just different in the human brain.

904
01:00:43.820 --> 01:00:48.560
Now maybe that doesn't have to be true in the machine brain,
but you know,

905
01:00:48.830 --> 01:00:53.830
we would be wise to give a thought to how people work when we're thinking about

906
01:00:54.981 --> 01:00:59.570
how to get machines to work.
So that's the,
that's the reason it's relevant

907
01:01:00.340 --> 01:01:05.340
<v 2>one way or one thing that comes to mind here is maybe another terminology</v>

908
01:01:06.340 --> 01:01:09.490
difference between these two things that might be useful is um,

909
01:01:09.790 --> 01:01:13.300
conceptual is sort of like symbolic reasoning,
symbolic processing,

910
01:01:13.450 --> 01:01:16.360
processing like you would do and like logical formula or something.
Yeah.

911
01:01:16.780 --> 01:01:21.310
Whereas like the other type of processing that you're considering is more like

912
01:01:21.550 --> 01:01:26.110
say it digital signal processor that translates audio data to digital data.

913
01:01:26.270 --> 01:01:28.570
It's not doing symbolic reasoning there.

914
01:01:28.571 --> 01:01:33.160
It's applying just some kind of fixed transformations that seems to be the site

915
01:01:33.190 --> 01:01:35.600
of phenomenal character and your view.
Yeah.

916
01:01:35.620 --> 01:01:40.590
But then gets brought up into this sort of symbolic central unit.
Yeah.
I,

917
01:01:40.850 --> 01:01:42.160
I accept that.
Yeah.

918
01:01:42.330 --> 01:01:43.163
<v 1>Good.</v>

919
01:01:52.560 --> 01:01:54.940
<v 0>Are any of these points,
do all of this off?</v>

920
01:01:54.960 --> 01:01:59.400
This makes sense still if you are a dual list.
Ah,

921
01:01:59.550 --> 01:02:01.920
okay.
Yeah.
Um,

922
01:02:02.880 --> 01:02:07.560
I think everything I've said could be accepted by a dualist.
Um,
maybe,

923
01:02:07.620 --> 01:02:12.480
uh,
well,
maybe not.
You know,
I did say some things,
it sounded like,

924
01:02:12.481 --> 01:02:13.980
I think there's a neural basis,

925
01:02:14.370 --> 01:02:18.540
but even doulas can accept a neural basis for conscious experience.

926
01:02:18.660 --> 01:02:20.040
So I think everything I said it could

927
01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:23.340
<v 1>be,
it could be thought of,
could be accepted by a dualist.</v>

928
01:02:24.360 --> 01:02:27.960
So the question is whether that neural basis is really all there is to it or
not.

929
01:02:30.780 --> 01:02:32.070
Okay.
Thank you.

930
01:02:44.610 --> 01:02:47.640
That's,
uh,
that's it for questions and let's thank that again.
