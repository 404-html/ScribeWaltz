1
00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:11.870
Good afternoon everyone.
Uh,
I am Cait Brant.

2
00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:16.790
I lead Google's global sustainability program and it's my honor to be here with

3
00:00:16.791 --> 00:00:17.660
you today.

4
00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:22.130
I'd like to introduce our very special panel that we have to talk about the new

5
00:00:22.131 --> 00:00:25.700
film.
So we have Joe Hansen from,

6
00:00:25.701 --> 00:00:27.230
it's okay to be smart.

7
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.920
<v 2>We have guests come on out,
Joe,</v>

8
00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.970
<v 3>and we have the directors of the film,
Bonnie Cohen and John Shank</v>

9
00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:54.880
and of course the star of the film,
former Vice President Al Gore.

10
00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:03.423
<v 2>Thank you.</v>

11
00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:18.340
<v 3>All right.
Thank you guys so much for being here with us this afternoon.</v>

12
00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.880
Thank you.
Great to be here.
Thank you.
All right,

13
00:01:21.881 --> 00:01:25.690
so I want to just start us off with you for Vice President Gore.
You know,

14
00:01:25.691 --> 00:01:29.980
I know it's been a little over a decade since the original film was released.

15
00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:31.600
Tell us a little bit about why now.

16
00:01:31.601 --> 00:01:33.940
Why did you want to make the sequel at this time?

17
00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.660
<v 1>Well,
first of all,</v>

18
00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:40.010
thank you for having us here and great to be with so many Googlers.
Uh,

19
00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.820
thank you for watching the film.

20
00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:47.510
We thought that the 10 year anniversary would be a a good time to ask the

21
00:01:48.391 --> 00:01:52.200
audience for permission to come back and say what's new?

22
00:01:52.201 --> 00:01:57.201
And it turns out there are a couple of really big new things.

23
00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:59.011
Number one,

24
00:01:59.011 --> 00:02:03.420
the climate related extreme weather events are a lot more numerous and

25
00:02:03.421 --> 00:02:08.130
unfortunately more destructive.
But secondly,
we've got the solutions.
Now,

26
00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.610
solar and wind electricity have come down incredibly fast and price.

27
00:02:14.311 --> 00:02:19.080
So an electric cars are becoming available.
Uh,
the new,

28
00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.200
the new consumer version of Tesla's about to come out.

29
00:02:22.201 --> 00:02:25.620
All of the major manufacturers are about to introduce,

30
00:02:25.621 --> 00:02:27.330
some batteries are coming down.

31
00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.440
So we have the ability to solve this now.

32
00:02:31.441 --> 00:02:34.590
And I think it's important to convey that message.

33
00:02:34.591 --> 00:02:39.591
And it's one of the reasons why people come away from watching the Bonnie and

34
00:02:39.901 --> 00:02:42.120
John's film feeling hopeful,

35
00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.420
but also feeling an increased sense of urgency.

36
00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.420
<v 3>Absolutely.
And,
and Bonnie and giant,
you know,</v>

37
00:02:48.421 --> 00:02:52.530
I know you took up the mantle from Davis Guggenheim who directed the first film.

38
00:02:52.531 --> 00:02:54.630
I'd love to hear you just talk a little bit about,

39
00:02:54.631 --> 00:02:58.710
did that influence your process at all or was there anything that really changed

40
00:02:58.711 --> 00:03:01.810
in the,
that you took to the film looking at it,
you know,
a decade on?

41
00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:04.280
<v 4>Um,</v>

42
00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:09.280
well we stand Bonnie and I and making this film really stand on the shoulders of

43
00:03:09.681 --> 00:03:13.370
an inconvenient truth.
It was a monumental moment in environmental history.

44
00:03:13.371 --> 00:03:15.230
It really,
um,
you know,

45
00:03:15.231 --> 00:03:19.670
gave us the language that many of us use to talk about the climate change,

46
00:03:19.671 --> 00:03:24.620
the climate crisis.
Um,
so,
um,
we were a little intimidated when we,

47
00:03:24.621 --> 00:03:28.190
when we got the call to get involved with an inconvenient sequel,

48
00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:33.530
but we were quite excited for the reasons that,
that Al just mentioned,
um,
to,

49
00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:38.210
to try to have a whack at,
uh,
telling,
telling a new kind of story.

50
00:03:38.211 --> 00:03:40.460
And Bonnie and I have,
um,
uh,

51
00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.270
a history of doing observational documentary is really doing kind of fly on the

52
00:03:44.271 --> 00:03:47.330
wall cinema verite approach to our films.

53
00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:51.370
And as soon as we met owl and,
and got the,
the,
the,

54
00:03:51.371 --> 00:03:54.830
the briefing about what he just described in terms of the climate crisis.

55
00:03:54.831 --> 00:03:55.521
And the solutions,

56
00:03:55.521 --> 00:03:59.360
we felt like we could really make a new type of story where we followed him

57
00:03:59.361 --> 00:04:03.890
around and saw the world through his eyes and experience the day to day drama

58
00:04:03.891 --> 00:04:08.210
that hit that hit that he,
um,
goes through in order to try to bring solutions.

59
00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:12.660
<v 3>Yeah.
And Bonnie,
how much did you guys know about climate going into the film?</v>

60
00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:15.101
<v 5>Well,
you know,</v>

61
00:04:15.101 --> 00:04:19.420
we made a film in back in 2012 called the island president,

62
00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:23.440
which was a film about the former,
uh,
first Democrat,

63
00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:25.690
democratically elected president of the Maldives,

64
00:04:25.691 --> 00:04:30.460
which if you know anything about the Maldives is the lowest lying island country

65
00:04:30.461 --> 00:04:35.070
in the world.
Um,
they're probably the most vulnerable,
um,

66
00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:39.640
amongst the low lying island nations to climate change.
And,
uh,

67
00:04:39.641 --> 00:04:41.650
so in the making of that film,

68
00:04:41.651 --> 00:04:46.060
we got quite an education about adapting to climate change,

69
00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:50.200
uh,
and,
and what,
what's at stake really.
Uh,
so,

70
00:04:50.201 --> 00:04:53.350
and I actually think the making of that film was one of the main reasons

71
00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:56.540
participants sought us out.
It's,
um,
they,

72
00:04:56.541 --> 00:05:00.460
they wanted to work with a directing team that knew something about this and

73
00:05:00.461 --> 00:05:05.170
already had a passion for it.
So,
um,
we had a bit of a leg up in that regard.

74
00:05:05.171 --> 00:05:06.250
But boy,

75
00:05:06.251 --> 00:05:10.420
what we didn't know really became clear as soon as we headed down to Nashville

76
00:05:10.421 --> 00:05:13.000
to here that 10 hour version of El slideshow.

77
00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:18.300
<v 6>So,
speaking of the slide show,
showing that light.</v>

78
00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:22.290
<v 3>So speaking of the slide show,
you know,</v>

79
00:05:22.291 --> 00:05:25.840
I know that they didn't really truly plays a starring whirl in,

80
00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:29.100
in both films as to your climate,
climate leadership trainings.

81
00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:32.430
About how many times at this point have you given that climate leadership

82
00:05:32.431 --> 00:05:33.264
training?

83
00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:38.000
<v 4>Oh,
of about,
let's see,
37 times.
Yeah.
Um,</v>

84
00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:41.900
and I've given the slide show countless thousands of times.

85
00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:45.230
<v 3>Yeah.
And I love to hear you talk a little bit about,
you know,</v>

86
00:05:45.231 --> 00:05:47.750
I know a lot of people have gone through that training now.

87
00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:51.890
What are a couple of examples of really inspiring actions that you've seen

88
00:05:51.891 --> 00:05:54.350
people take following participating in the training?

89
00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:57.940
<v 4>The first thing that spring,
well,
there's so many.
Uh,</v>

90
00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:02.700
<v 1>the,
the woman who headed the Paris negotiation,</v>

91
00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:04.700
Christiana Figueres went through the,

92
00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:08.720
the first large trying to a climate training program.
I had,

93
00:06:08.721 --> 00:06:12.190
the first one was in my barn at the farm.
Uh,

94
00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:14.690
but the first big one was in Nashville.

95
00:06:14.691 --> 00:06:18.980
And Christiana went through that and later on became the head of the whole

96
00:06:18.981 --> 00:06:23.150
negotiation.
Um,
at the other end of,
uh,
of that spectrum,

97
00:06:23.151 --> 00:06:24.900
I think of,
uh,

98
00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:30.460
an 11 year old girl who went through the Denver training several months ago.

99
00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:36.200
And I almost thought she was too young to go through the training.

100
00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:41.540
But two weeks later,
uh,
clicked on a video,
uh,

101
00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:45.050
on,
uh,
Youtube,
uh,
and,
uh,

102
00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:48.680
it had gone viral and she had,

103
00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:53.860
she went to a town hall meeting of her Republican member of Congress and got the

104
00:06:54.891 --> 00:06:56.880
mic and she had her,
uh,

105
00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:59.780
questions on the iPad and she was just giving him the business

106
00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:04.150
<v 7>climate and a,
I was so,</v>

107
00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:11.850
<v 1>and she ended by inviting him to come to her science class the following week</v>

108
00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:15.930
where she was going to present the entire slide show.
But he was busy that day.

109
00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:19.520
<v 3>Wow.
Wow.
So Joe,
I want to get you in here.</v>

110
00:07:19.521 --> 00:07:23.480
So I know you of course also do a lot of communicating about climate through

111
00:07:23.481 --> 00:07:24.314
your work.

112
00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:28.760
Can you talk a little bit about how you like to approach educating people about

113
00:07:28.761 --> 00:07:30.860
climate who really aren't familiar with the issue?

114
00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:33.770
<v 8>So as,
as an edu creator,</v>

115
00:07:33.771 --> 00:07:38.030
it's an interesting place to be on the front lines because uh,
you know,

116
00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:42.110
very few of us are climate scientists.
I'm a biologist,

117
00:07:42.111 --> 00:07:45.440
but as a scientist and an educator at that,
that that combination,

118
00:07:45.441 --> 00:07:49.490
that experience is a really interesting responsibility and challenge,

119
00:07:49.890 --> 00:07:53.210
uh,
in all of my videos,
whether it's climate or otherwise,

120
00:07:53.211 --> 00:07:57.230
that the most important lesson that I try to get across the message is that it's

121
00:07:57.231 --> 00:07:58.610
okay that you don't know this.

122
00:07:58.670 --> 00:08:01.310
I think that that is such an important part for people.

123
00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:06.520
They feel intimidated by the weight and the history of climate science and they

124
00:08:06.951 --> 00:08:10.460
feel afraid to maybe even take the first steps to understand it.

125
00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:15.350
And that's what makes it so easy to kind of just maybe do what are our favorite

126
00:08:15.351 --> 00:08:17.750
political leader does or the way that we voted last.

127
00:08:17.751 --> 00:08:19.370
Or maybe just not even pay attention at all.

128
00:08:19.371 --> 00:08:22.910
So that's the most important thing is to help people build that confidence,

129
00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:25.880
to give them a kind of a positive education experience.

130
00:08:26.090 --> 00:08:27.050
If you can get through that,

131
00:08:27.230 --> 00:08:30.590
I think that's the biggest hurdle to kind of getting people to do the next

132
00:08:30.591 --> 00:08:34.670
things which are act and enact solutions and our own life and,
you know,

133
00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:38.180
get on the phone and write emails and all of the truth to power things that we

134
00:08:38.181 --> 00:08:39.014
need to do.

135
00:08:39.070 --> 00:08:43.840
<v 3>Absolutely.
Yeah.
And speaking of action,
you know,
what John,
for you,</v>

136
00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:45.280
obviously,
you know,

137
00:08:45.281 --> 00:08:49.690
one of the roles of impact film is to really inspire people to take action.

138
00:08:49.691 --> 00:08:49.871
You know,

139
00:08:49.871 --> 00:08:54.190
how do you guys think about how you ensure that this fell really drives people

140
00:08:54.191 --> 00:08:55.470
to,
to act on climate?

141
00:08:57.320 --> 00:09:00.520
<v 4>Well,
um,
you know,
Bonnie and I again are,
are,</v>

142
00:09:00.521 --> 00:09:03.650
are big believers in that films are,
you know,

143
00:09:05.030 --> 00:09:09.280
really at their core emotional vehicles that,
that they,
they,

144
00:09:09.281 --> 00:09:12.620
they really can wake people up and,
and uh,

145
00:09:13.490 --> 00:09:14.690
through the power of story,

146
00:09:14.691 --> 00:09:18.500
which by the way a participant media which produced the film,
that's,

147
00:09:18.530 --> 00:09:21.660
that's really kind of their basic reason for being is a,

148
00:09:21.661 --> 00:09:24.890
Jeff Skole is a big believer that the power of story,

149
00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:28.820
especially combined with a social cause is just a magical combination and

150
00:09:28.821 --> 00:09:32.600
obviously an inconvenient truth,
uh,
prove that many times over.

151
00:09:32.601 --> 00:09:36.200
And we're hoping that our film can follow in the footsteps of that.

152
00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:40.610
We really feel like,
as,
as Al says,
at the end of the film,

153
00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:43.970
something's happened with the climate crisis and the solutions to it,
which is,

154
00:09:43.971 --> 00:09:48.030
it's,
it's flipped over from being a,
um,
kind of,
uh,

155
00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:52.550
a partisan debate and kind of with this kind of tribalism and something's

156
00:09:52.551 --> 00:09:56.170
happening now where it's now become more of a social issue in,
in the,
in the,

157
00:09:56.180 --> 00:10:00.480
in really more like the civil rights issue or the suffrage issue or,

158
00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:02.870
or recently the,
the gay rights movement.

159
00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:07.130
And people know because they've lived with the information for,

160
00:10:07.131 --> 00:10:11.300
for long enough now they know what the right thing is and they're starting to

161
00:10:11.301 --> 00:10:14.690
make decisions at the local level and their companies.
I mean,
look at Google,

162
00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:19.940
you know,
yourselves,
you're doing amazing work in the sustainable energy.
Um,
uh,

163
00:10:19.941 --> 00:10:22.040
and,
and,
and young people know this and they're,

164
00:10:22.041 --> 00:10:25.430
and they're starting to get on board from a grassroots level and we tell that

165
00:10:25.431 --> 00:10:27.950
story in the film.
We,
we,
it's evident in,

166
00:10:27.951 --> 00:10:32.210
in through owls' eyes as he goes around the world and talks to people and tries

167
00:10:32.211 --> 00:10:36.830
to,
to move the needle on,
on this debate.
You see the energy as it's growing.

168
00:10:37.170 --> 00:10:41.880
<v 3>Yeah,
absolutely.
And,
and,
and for you from our Vice President Gore,
you know,</v>

169
00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:44.880
when you,
when you're talking to individuals,
what do you,

170
00:10:44.881 --> 00:10:48.510
what do you think is the most important thing that people can be doing in their

171
00:10:48.511 --> 00:10:51.060
everyday lives to be taking an action on climate?

172
00:10:51.061 --> 00:10:53.400
How do you empower them to really take it on?

173
00:10:54.090 --> 00:10:56.700
<v 1>I encourage people first to learn it,
learn about it.</v>

174
00:10:56.940 --> 00:10:59.340
And this movie is a good way to learn about it.

175
00:10:59.370 --> 00:11:03.570
There's a book of the same title out today as well.

176
00:11:03.610 --> 00:11:08.520
Go to the website,
inconvenient sequel.com.
Did I mention the website?

177
00:11:08.670 --> 00:11:13.260
<v 4>convenience.com,
and you can buy advance tickets.
They're also,</v>

178
00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:17.490
um,
movie is opening today

179
00:11:20.340 --> 00:11:23.670
<v 7>in La,
in La,
in</v>

180
00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:27.990
<v 1>New York,
and then,
uh,
in all other cities a week from today.</v>

181
00:11:28.430 --> 00:11:29.760
Um,
but you know,

182
00:11:29.761 --> 00:11:34.761
knowledge is power and knowledge can make you confident in your way of

183
00:11:34.771 --> 00:11:36.960
communicating.
So that's a first step.

184
00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:41.490
And then use your voice when the conversations on climate.

185
00:11:41.491 --> 00:11:45.120
You don't have to be mean or aggressive or hostile or anything,

186
00:11:45.121 --> 00:11:49.410
but be persistent.
I saw this happen in the,

187
00:11:49.470 --> 00:11:53.500
in the civil rights movement when it was gaining momentum in the south or I was

188
00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:55.990
growing up and it was,

189
00:11:56.020 --> 00:12:00.840
that caused was one in conversations,
millions of them,
uh,

190
00:12:00.850 --> 00:12:05.760
before the laws changed.
Uh,
secondly,
use your phone,
uh,

191
00:12:05.950 --> 00:12:08.080
and not just your vote,

192
00:12:08.081 --> 00:12:13.081
but all of the tools you have available to as a citizen in our democracy.

193
00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:18.700
It's true that big money plays a toxic role in our politics now,

194
00:12:18.701 --> 00:12:23.701
but we can still clear the bar for convincing elected officials that they've got

195
00:12:25.771 --> 00:12:26.950
to do what the people want.

196
00:12:26.950 --> 00:12:31.950
If enough people are willing to communicate forcefully and tell candidates that

197
00:12:33.761 --> 00:12:38.170
this is important to you.
And then third,
use your choices in life.

198
00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:43.900
If you go into the marketplace and insist upon a more climate friendly

199
00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:49.330
alternative,
yes,
that will help you reduce your personal impact.

200
00:12:49.690 --> 00:12:54.340
But it also sends a powerful signal to,
to business.
Uh,

201
00:12:54.341 --> 00:12:59.341
and it's not an accident that businesses in almost every market sector are now

202
00:13:00.340 --> 00:13:04.060
advertising that they're greener than their competition because they're hearing

203
00:13:04.061 --> 00:13:09.061
from enough people now that they realize that it's important and can be the

204
00:13:09.671 --> 00:13:11.380
difference between profit and loss.

205
00:13:11.750 --> 00:13:13.970
<v 5>Yeah,
absolutely.
And Bonnie,</v>

206
00:13:13.971 --> 00:13:17.600
I know we were talking a little bit backstage about another form of action that

207
00:13:17.601 --> 00:13:18.141
people are taking,

208
00:13:18.141 --> 00:13:21.800
which is user generated content and that that played an important role for you

209
00:13:21.801 --> 00:13:25.010
guys in making the film.
Can you talk a little bit more about that?
Yeah,

210
00:13:25.011 --> 00:13:25.821
absolutely.
I mean,

211
00:13:25.821 --> 00:13:30.590
it's also true of El slide show as compared to 2006,

212
00:13:30.591 --> 00:13:34.400
you know,
where it was mostly stills and graphs.
Now the,

213
00:13:34.730 --> 00:13:38.590
the slideshow is filled with examples of,
uh,
that,
that,

214
00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:43.920
that were collected potentially off of youtube and other places around or sent

215
00:13:44.691 --> 00:13:49.691
in from just ordinary citizens around the world who are experiencing climate

216
00:13:50.031 --> 00:13:54.920
related extreme weather events.
And they're unbelievable.
I mean,

217
00:13:54.940 --> 00:13:58.000
for,
from a visual perspective,
um,

218
00:13:58.340 --> 00:14:02.870
it looks like computer graphically generated,
um,
visual material.

219
00:14:03.140 --> 00:14:04.140
So,
um,

220
00:14:04.250 --> 00:14:08.060
in the film we have a number of these examples both inside the slideshow and

221
00:14:08.061 --> 00:14:10.800
outside.
The best example I think,
uh,

222
00:14:10.820 --> 00:14:15.820
came from a helicopter pilot in Greenland who was just flying his helicopter and

223
00:14:17.301 --> 00:14:22.010
as he was flying over the Yacob Sharvin glacier,
he's,
he noted a,
it was,

224
00:14:22.011 --> 00:14:23.300
this was the middle of April,

225
00:14:23.330 --> 00:14:28.330
which is quite early that not only was it extremely hotter than normal,

226
00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:32.570
but the glaciers were exploding and just,
you know,

227
00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:37.410
kind of falling down and all of these different places as he cascade or was,

228
00:14:37.411 --> 00:14:39.680
he pulled out his iPhone.
He's like,
this is incredible.

229
00:14:39.681 --> 00:14:42.620
I've been flying this for years.
I've never seen this.

230
00:14:42.860 --> 00:14:44.840
And he just recorded it at the window.

231
00:14:45.110 --> 00:14:49.310
And you'll see it in the film when you all go tonight to the movies.
Um,

232
00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:52.130
it's it like

233
00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:53.120
<v 3>something out of it.</v>

234
00:14:53.370 --> 00:14:57.630
<v 8>The most beautifully directed,
composed Scifi film you've ever seen.</v>

235
00:14:57.631 --> 00:14:58.950
And it's our world.

236
00:15:01.710 --> 00:15:04.040
<v 3>And Joe,
you know,
I know in the work that you do,
you know,</v>

237
00:15:04.041 --> 00:15:06.710
you're thinking about how do we break these issues down for people?

238
00:15:06.711 --> 00:15:08.360
How do we make them relatable?

239
00:15:08.361 --> 00:15:12.050
So I'd love to hear you talk a little bit about how do you make climate feel

240
00:15:12.051 --> 00:15:14.180
relevant for people in their daily lives?

241
00:15:14.181 --> 00:15:16.790
And what are some examples that you've used that you feel like it really worked

242
00:15:16.791 --> 00:15:17.690
for your viewers?

243
00:15:18.930 --> 00:15:19.201
<v 8>Well,</v>

244
00:15:19.201 --> 00:15:23.120
one thing that we're able to do on youtube and other creators know this is that,

245
00:15:23.190 --> 00:15:25.670
I mean,
we look right at the camera.
We're,

246
00:15:25.671 --> 00:15:28.770
we're already starting a conversation with the people who are watching our

247
00:15:28.771 --> 00:15:30.780
videos.
It's,
it's not a fly on the wall.

248
00:15:30.810 --> 00:15:34.860
I'm talking to them and I want them to talk back,
you know,
in the comments and,

249
00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:39.600
you know,
hopefully be friendly.
But,
uh,
beyond that,
you know,
again,
climate,

250
00:15:39.630 --> 00:15:42.540
climate science,
climate change,
the are all the issues that,

251
00:15:42.541 --> 00:15:44.340
that connect with this.
They are so heavy,

252
00:15:44.370 --> 00:15:46.590
it is carrying around this big heavy thing.

253
00:15:46.860 --> 00:15:50.520
And if we just tie that to one string and say that's science,

254
00:15:50.530 --> 00:15:52.650
we're just going to stay at the science.
The science is science.

255
00:15:53.010 --> 00:15:57.180
It's very hard to hold that.
But if we can tie that to a bunch of other things,

256
00:15:57.181 --> 00:16:01.390
so I'll,
I'll tie that to uh,
to biology and to nature to there.
Uh,

257
00:16:01.740 --> 00:16:05.480
if you're a fan of geology or history or paleontology or,
uh,

258
00:16:05.650 --> 00:16:08.970
even psychology about how people think about climate change,
we've,

259
00:16:08.971 --> 00:16:12.570
we've kind of approached the subject from all these different ways that helps us

260
00:16:12.571 --> 00:16:16.950
tie these other strings to,
to make it more resonant with people,

261
00:16:16.980 --> 00:16:19.590
but give them another way to carry that and make it more,
uh,

262
00:16:19.650 --> 00:16:23.730
more valuable to them.
So it doesn't feel just so heavy based on that one.
Maybe.

263
00:16:23.731 --> 00:16:27.690
Maybe science just isn't quite enough for everybody there.
Yeah.

264
00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:28.461
<v 3>And,
and John,</v>

265
00:16:28.461 --> 00:16:32.030
you were talking a little bit before about how this has really become a social

266
00:16:32.031 --> 00:16:34.460
justice issue for people.
This become more personal.

267
00:16:34.461 --> 00:16:39.200
And one thing I think you guys did really well in the film was draw that

268
00:16:39.201 --> 00:16:42.800
connection of what is the impact that climate is really having on people's
lives.

269
00:16:42.801 --> 00:16:43.011
You know,

270
00:16:43.011 --> 00:16:46.850
that really powerful footage about Super Typhoon Haiyan and how that impacted

271
00:16:46.851 --> 00:16:49.910
people,
how Zika is impacting women and their families.

272
00:16:50.270 --> 00:16:53.390
Can you just talk a little bit more about how you think about that people planet

273
00:16:53.391 --> 00:16:56.660
connection and what role that played for you guys and how you wanted to tell the

274
00:16:56.661 --> 00:16:57.494
story.

275
00:16:58.000 --> 00:16:58.691
<v 4>Yeah,
absolutely.</v>

276
00:16:58.691 --> 00:17:02.090
And I think it dovetails with the discussion we're talking about,
um,

277
00:17:02.110 --> 00:17:06.740
in terms of user generated video and um,
the Internet and the,

278
00:17:06.940 --> 00:17:11.080
the,
the,
the clarity that,
um,

279
00:17:11.110 --> 00:17:16.110
that we see the world with now because of the ability for people to broadcast

280
00:17:16.511 --> 00:17:20.460
from,
you know,
from their phones.
And um,
it's really incredible.
It's,

281
00:17:20.470 --> 00:17:22.930
it's amplifying,
uh,

282
00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:27.160
people's voices and it's allowing people to,
I think,

283
00:17:27.161 --> 00:17:31.900
feel more closely connected to places that aren't necessarily right in their

284
00:17:31.901 --> 00:17:35.830
field of view.
In,
in their home.
And because of that,
um,

285
00:17:36.970 --> 00:17:41.050
the fact that Mother Nature is screaming so loud is becoming more evident.

286
00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:41.771
You know,
the,
the,

287
00:17:41.771 --> 00:17:46.150
the climate crisis has grown worse and the evidence of it is clear.

288
00:17:46.151 --> 00:17:50.340
And when it gets uploaded to youtube,
it's hard.
It's harder and harder to deny.

289
00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:55.020
It's,
um,
you know,
the evil witch has been perpetrated on,
on our,

290
00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:59.550
on particularly on American political system with the money from fossil fuel

291
00:17:59.580 --> 00:18:04.580
companies trying to confuse this issue is I'm up against this giant truth out

292
00:18:04.651 --> 00:18:08.970
there,
which is that people are noticing that the climate is changing.
And,
um,

293
00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:12.330
so I think,
uh,
you know,

294
00:18:12.331 --> 00:18:17.220
that gets into the very quickly gets into this realm where people,
uh,

295
00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:20.550
you know,
are looking at,
at,
at their day to day lives.

296
00:18:20.630 --> 00:18:24.420
I'm either on their computer or in their actual lives and they're seeing,

297
00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:29.490
they're seeing evidence of something that they're being told a doesn't exist.

298
00:18:29.491 --> 00:18:32.370
And so the two things aren't jiving.
And so I think that,
um,

299
00:18:32.580 --> 00:18:35.160
it's becoming clearer and clearer to people,

300
00:18:35.161 --> 00:18:37.920
especially as we live with the information over over decades,

301
00:18:37.921 --> 00:18:39.990
that it is time to act.

302
00:18:39.991 --> 00:18:43.500
Especially since the solutions are here and it's so easy to,
to act.

303
00:18:43.980 --> 00:18:47.610
<v 3>Absolutely.
And,
and for our Vice President Corey know you talk in,</v>

304
00:18:47.611 --> 00:18:49.390
in both films about the,

305
00:18:49.391 --> 00:18:52.830
the Blue Planet image and that that's been an important one for you.

306
00:18:52.831 --> 00:18:56.460
That's how you started the slide show for many years.
I loved her.

307
00:18:56.461 --> 00:19:01.260
We talk a little bit more about that power of being able to see the planet,

308
00:19:01.430 --> 00:19:05.370
um,
as well as tools enable us to actually see the impacts of climate change over

309
00:19:05.371 --> 00:19:06.960
time.
Like Google earth engine.

310
00:19:07.650 --> 00:19:11.730
<v 1>Yeah.
And Google earth engine,
uh,
plays such an important role,</v>

311
00:19:12.420 --> 00:19:17.420
but one of the challenges in dealing with the climate crisis is it scale its

312
00:19:17.851 --> 00:19:21.030
magnitude,
the timeframes involved.

313
00:19:21.031 --> 00:19:24.150
And so seeing the earth,
uh,

314
00:19:24.390 --> 00:19:26.920
as beautiful as it is floating in the,

315
00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:32.000
in the void of space helps people I think to shift their perspective away from

316
00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:39.440
the narrow short term focus that most of us spend time dwelling on naturally.

317
00:19:41.850 --> 00:19:42.420
And,

318
00:19:42.420 --> 00:19:47.420
and just a shift to think about what's at stake here.

319
00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:51.930
When that image was first seen back in,

320
00:19:52.610 --> 00:19:57.610
well the first one was in December of 1968 and then the blue marble in December

321
00:19:57.691 --> 00:20:02.010
of 1972.
It had a really profound impact.

322
00:20:02.011 --> 00:20:04.410
Many of you are too young to,

323
00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:07.920
to remember what it was like back then.

324
00:20:07.921 --> 00:20:12.921
Nobody had ever seen an image like that before and it really had a big effect.

325
00:20:14.580 --> 00:20:15.600
Within 18 months,

326
00:20:15.601 --> 00:20:20.601
the first Earth Day was organized and major environmental legislation was passed

327
00:20:20.881 --> 00:20:25.230
the clean air act,
which actually now serves as the legislative basis for,

328
00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:27.950
for the clean power plan,
uh,

329
00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:32.100
that states at least are implementing California's moving forward.

330
00:20:32.610 --> 00:20:33.443
Um,

331
00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:38.900
so I just think that realizing we all share the same home it is now at,

332
00:20:43.411 --> 00:20:48.010
at risk,
or at least the conditions conducive to the flourishing of

333
00:20:48.010 --> 00:20:50.200
<v 5>humanity are at risk.</v>

334
00:20:50.620 --> 00:20:54.460
And having that perspective I think is invaluable.
Yeah,

335
00:20:54.610 --> 00:20:56.440
<v 3>absolutely.
And,
and funny,</v>

336
00:20:56.441 --> 00:21:00.280
we were talking a little bit before about how you guys actually used youtube a

337
00:21:00.281 --> 00:21:03.010
bit in the making of the film.
Can you tell us a little bit more about that?

338
00:21:03.130 --> 00:21:03.611
<v 5>Well,
yeah,</v>

339
00:21:03.611 --> 00:21:08.140
just getting back to the user generated videos that you'll see throughout the

340
00:21:08.141 --> 00:21:09.400
film.
Um,

341
00:21:09.700 --> 00:21:14.290
we knew that we were going certain places with Al our,
you know,
we,

342
00:21:14.291 --> 00:21:18.370
we looked at his schedule for the year and we thought we would go to certain

343
00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:20.460
places with him where we thought either Trent,

344
00:21:20.470 --> 00:21:23.980
where we knew other trainings were happening or there were other reasons to go.

345
00:21:23.981 --> 00:21:26.290
A Greenland obviously where,
um,

346
00:21:26.340 --> 00:21:29.740
science he was going to be meeting with scientists and learning so much from

347
00:21:29.741 --> 00:21:34.210
these glaciologists about the state of the ice and,
and such.
Um,

348
00:21:34.270 --> 00:21:37.540
we did quite a bit of research on Youtube,

349
00:21:37.570 --> 00:21:42.160
youtube about what kinds of user generated material might be available in those

350
00:21:42.161 --> 00:21:45.580
locations.
We knew we were going to be going to the Philippines,
for example,

351
00:21:45.581 --> 00:21:48.430
to talk with survivors of Typhoon Haiyan.

352
00:21:48.580 --> 00:21:53.020
So we went on to youtube to see what kinds of things we could find,
um,

353
00:21:53.080 --> 00:21:58.080
from the moment that the storm started taken by people who had survived it.

354
00:21:58.300 --> 00:22:02.600
And it was incredible what was,
what we were able to find.
And,
um,

355
00:22:02.860 --> 00:22:06.070
the emotion that is packed into those,
um,

356
00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:11.100
really completely pure experiences when you see them in the film unadulterated

357
00:22:12.521 --> 00:22:16.840
by the directors or by Al Gore or anybody else.

358
00:22:16.841 --> 00:22:20.650
Um,
you know,
the,
the authenticity of that is,
is unmatched.

359
00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:25.430
<v 3>Yeah.
And in Joe's curious,
you know,
I know,
um,
you make,</v>

360
00:22:26.090 --> 00:22:30.650
you make stories about climate change but also on other scientific issues.

361
00:22:30.860 --> 00:22:33.710
You know,
as a youtube creator,
obviously you get comments,
right.

362
00:22:33.711 --> 00:22:35.240
I would love to hear you talk a little bit about,

363
00:22:35.241 --> 00:22:38.900
have you noticed anything that's different about the kind of comments that you

364
00:22:38.901 --> 00:22:42.590
get when you're creating content around climate versus on other topics?

365
00:22:42.690 --> 00:22:44.090
No Way.

366
00:22:45.010 --> 00:22:47.110
<v 8>There's certainly a lot more of them.
Uh,
you know,</v>

367
00:22:47.111 --> 00:22:51.060
I think second place is probably any video about evolution,
but,
um,

368
00:22:51.850 --> 00:22:56.260
it really,
you can tell you're striking a chord with people and that is,
uh,

369
00:22:56.310 --> 00:23:00.040
that is an,
that shows us that something's happening there.
Uh,
you know,
when,
when,

370
00:23:00.100 --> 00:23:03.280
when a thought is held in your brain and it's tricky and it hurts a little bit.

371
00:23:03.281 --> 00:23:05.200
I mean,
that's,
that can be a really good thing.

372
00:23:05.230 --> 00:23:09.370
It means you're spending some time and,
and challenge and challenging that,

373
00:23:09.460 --> 00:23:13.510
that whoever that viewer is,
I mean,
that's a really important moment.
Um,

374
00:23:13.690 --> 00:23:17.050
we certainly get comments when I can tell people are helicoptering in who

375
00:23:17.051 --> 00:23:20.380
haven't really watched the video and just want to copy and paste something in

376
00:23:20.381 --> 00:23:22.200
there.
But,
um,
we,

377
00:23:22.201 --> 00:23:26.350
we allow people to come in and do that and to have that experience and have that

378
00:23:26.351 --> 00:23:30.500
challenging experience.
Um,
we don't,
we don't,
we don't,
uh,

379
00:23:30.850 --> 00:23:35.230
re kind of lean back on the science where we're not,
we,
we put it out there.

380
00:23:35.231 --> 00:23:38.080
We were very clear and confident about what we know,

381
00:23:38.470 --> 00:23:40.970
but we let people have that conversation,
um,

382
00:23:41.230 --> 00:23:44.770
amongst themselves because I don't think we can ever really hit them over the

383
00:23:44.771 --> 00:23:46.190
head with it.
We're going to let them

384
00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:48.260
<v 1>have to take that journey for themselves.</v>

385
00:23:48.290 --> 00:23:51.500
Hopefully we create a good place to do that.
And,
uh,
you know,

386
00:23:51.501 --> 00:23:53.090
with something educational up top.

387
00:23:53.310 --> 00:23:57.670
<v 3>Yeah,
yeah,
absolutely.
So for Vice President Gore,
I love to turn to the topic of,</v>

388
00:23:57.671 --> 00:24:00.190
of technology for a moment.
You know,

389
00:24:00.191 --> 00:24:04.840
and I think we have some of these emerging technologies,
cloud computing,

390
00:24:04.841 --> 00:24:06.880
block chain,
machine learning.

391
00:24:07.090 --> 00:24:10.390
What are your thoughts on what impacts any of those technologies or other

392
00:24:10.391 --> 00:24:13.420
emerging technologies could have on the fight against climate change?

393
00:24:16.420 --> 00:24:20.680
<v 1>If you look at the,
the astonishing costs down curves,</v>

394
00:24:20.681 --> 00:24:23.620
cost reduction,
curves for solar and wind,

395
00:24:24.490 --> 00:24:29.490
you now see a similar pattern with the cost reduction for,

396
00:24:29.620 --> 00:24:31.450
for batteries.
Very,

397
00:24:31.451 --> 00:24:36.451
very exciting electric vehicles and hundreds of exciting new efficiency

398
00:24:39.790 --> 00:24:43.540
technologies that don't have the sex appeal,
if you will.

399
00:24:43.541 --> 00:24:46.870
And the recognition but taken together are really huge.

400
00:24:47.710 --> 00:24:52.660
I have now come to the conclusion and others have as well,

401
00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:58.200
that we are in the early stages of a global sustainability revolution,

402
00:24:59.530 --> 00:25:03.880
which has the magnitude of the industrial revolution,

403
00:25:04.630 --> 00:25:06.790
but the speed of the digital revolution.

404
00:25:07.540 --> 00:25:11.290
And instead of starting in a little corner of England in a world of one and a

405
00:25:11.291 --> 00:25:15.010
half a billion people and slowly spreading outward,

406
00:25:15.460 --> 00:25:20.350
this a sustainability revolution as being jumped started in rich and poor

407
00:25:20.351 --> 00:25:23.170
countries alike and every part of the world.

408
00:25:23.171 --> 00:25:28.150
And it's empowered by a lot of the new digital tools that enhance our

409
00:25:28.900 --> 00:25:30.550
productivity and our ability.

410
00:25:30.580 --> 00:25:35.300
The Internet of things is beginning to play a huge role.
Uh,

411
00:25:35.410 --> 00:25:38.060
we're gaining the ability to,

412
00:25:38.130 --> 00:25:42.940
to deal with molecules and atoms that matches our ability to deal with bits of

413
00:25:42.941 --> 00:25:45.400
information.
And as a result,

414
00:25:45.401 --> 00:25:50.401
we're seeing incredible improvements in efficiency of all kinds.

415
00:25:51.280 --> 00:25:56.280
Global emissions of global warming pollution have actually stabilized and begun

416
00:25:57.431 --> 00:26:02.110
to come down a little bit over the last three years.
They're coming down in,

417
00:26:02.170 --> 00:26:05.410
in the U S uh,
in Europe,
in China,

418
00:26:06.370 --> 00:26:08.980
and in India.

419
00:26:09.820 --> 00:26:13.800
They've done a uturn since the Paris agreement.
Uh,

420
00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:17.380
they're using low cost credit now to vastly expand solar.

421
00:26:17.381 --> 00:26:22.381
They're closing lots of coal burning plants and they just announced that within

422
00:26:23.141 --> 00:26:24.490
only 13 years,

423
00:26:24.820 --> 00:26:29.820
100% of all the cars and trucks sold in India are going to have to be electric

424
00:26:30.581 --> 00:26:33.460
vehicles.
We ought to make a commitment like that here.

425
00:26:40.220 --> 00:26:41.660
<v 3>So John,
you know,</v>

426
00:26:41.661 --> 00:26:45.420
I know one of the really iconic images that I know I was left with,

427
00:26:45.421 --> 00:26:48.490
many of us were left with from an inconvenient truth was the,

428
00:26:48.500 --> 00:26:51.810
the hockey stick chart of growing carbon emissions.

429
00:26:52.290 --> 00:26:56.370
Did you guys think at all about trying to have sort of an analogous image for

430
00:26:56.371 --> 00:27:00.630
this film?
You know,
what do you really want us to be left with?
Yeah.
All right,

431
00:27:00.690 --> 00:27:03.500
well that please talk about it.
Talking about Chile.
Yup.
Yeah.

432
00:27:04.030 --> 00:27:07.380
<v 1>Well I think,
oh,
you should do the honors.
What were saying please sleep.
Uh,</v>

433
00:27:07.420 --> 00:27:09.640
it doesn't,
it doesn't feature a,
a,

434
00:27:09.641 --> 00:27:12.650
a forklift or a man lift as they call it in the,

435
00:27:12.660 --> 00:27:17.660
in the first two lines going away up on the right hand side.

436
00:27:18.250 --> 00:27:19.071
But,
uh,

437
00:27:19.071 --> 00:27:24.071
there's an image that illustrates how quickly the developing country,

438
00:27:24.521 --> 00:27:27.010
it's kind of an advanced developing country.
Chile,

439
00:27:27.011 --> 00:27:32.011
they have great policy but a lot of poverty and they have started deploying

440
00:27:33.370 --> 00:27:37.720
solar.
Michelle bashful,
a,
the president is,
does a terrific job.

441
00:27:38.020 --> 00:27:43.000
I worked with her and her first tour of duty as president of Chile years ago and

442
00:27:43.001 --> 00:27:46.110
she came in this time.
And so it,

443
00:27:46.111 --> 00:27:49.870
it does the bar graphs with like,
I can't remember the exact numbers,

444
00:27:49.871 --> 00:27:53.740
but like 15 megawatts and then 400 megawatts,

445
00:27:53.741 --> 00:27:56.560
850 megawatts.
And then the,

446
00:27:56.561 --> 00:28:00.910
then the movie goes to here's what they have under construction and approve or

447
00:28:00.911 --> 00:28:05.410
construction now.
And the image goes up and up and up and up and up.

448
00:28:05.411 --> 00:28:07.900
Just like that image in the first movie,

449
00:28:08.320 --> 00:28:13.070
13.3 gigawatts.
And it just completely dwarfs the,

450
00:28:13.340 --> 00:28:15.870
the bar graphs that preceded.
And,

451
00:28:15.880 --> 00:28:20.590
and what it illustrates is that they had,

452
00:28:20.620 --> 00:28:22.090
they started slowly,

453
00:28:22.360 --> 00:28:26.650
but they realize they were saving money and cleaning the air at the same time.

454
00:28:27.010 --> 00:28:30.520
Awareness of the climate crisis in Chile is huge.
They've had these,

455
00:28:30.910 --> 00:28:34.390
they had a million acres destroyed by fire.
Uh,
this year.

456
00:28:34.391 --> 00:28:35.710
They've had these record floods.

457
00:28:35.711 --> 00:28:40.360
One of them is in the movie and both of those images are in the,
in the movie.
Um,

458
00:28:40.450 --> 00:28:45.130
and they just decided to get their policy right and they have unleashed this

459
00:28:45.131 --> 00:28:47.110
incredible revolution.

460
00:28:47.530 --> 00:28:52.180
There was an economist of the late great Rudi Dornbusch show once said,

461
00:28:53.350 --> 00:28:56.380
things take longer to happen than you think they will.

462
00:28:56.650 --> 00:29:00.070
But then they happen much faster than you thought they could.

463
00:29:00.790 --> 00:29:05.790
And that is what is illustrated in that image in the movie takes.

464
00:29:06.470 --> 00:29:08.700
And if you look at global deployments of,

465
00:29:08.701 --> 00:29:13.690
of solar it 10 years ago with the first movie we were,

466
00:29:14.020 --> 00:29:18.700
we had this long flat line and it was just beginning to go up.

467
00:29:18.910 --> 00:29:22.090
And now in this movie it goes shoot.
Just like that.

468
00:29:22.360 --> 00:29:24.040
And that's true of wind.

469
00:29:24.041 --> 00:29:28.330
It's true of all these sustainability technologies.
And,
and it's,

470
00:29:28.510 --> 00:29:32.200
it's very exciting.
We can solve this,
we're going to solve it.

471
00:29:32.650 --> 00:29:37.480
The remaining question is how quickly we will solve it because more damage is

472
00:29:37.481 --> 00:29:40.930
being done every day as the movie also.

473
00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:46.600
So it's a race against time and we need to solve it,

474
00:29:46.910 --> 00:29:47.320
uh,

475
00:29:47.320 --> 00:29:52.320
before we cross some of these tipping points that are dangerous and that are out

476
00:29:52.361 --> 00:29:57.310
there.
Uh,
and we need to minimize the damage that we hand off to,

477
00:29:57.760 --> 00:30:00.550
to the next generation.
To many of you guys,

478
00:30:00.930 --> 00:30:03.450
<v 4>you know,
in the WWE as another piece of,
uh,</v>

479
00:30:03.451 --> 00:30:08.280
of evidence about this question that you asked about where we are and the

480
00:30:08.281 --> 00:30:10.830
technology of,
of the solutions.

481
00:30:11.160 --> 00:30:14.190
This amazing thing happened in the movie that we actually didn't anticipate,

482
00:30:14.191 --> 00:30:19.191
which is that we go to Paris with al and then we're behind the scenes as the,

483
00:30:19.650 --> 00:30:22.890
the deal is,
is underway.
And it's not.
No.

484
00:30:22.940 --> 00:30:27.940
And it's actually unsure whether there's going to be success in Paris during the

485
00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:30.660
couple of weeks that that world leaders and environmental ministers from all

486
00:30:30.661 --> 00:30:35.190
over the world that we're in Paris negotiating the steel and,
um,

487
00:30:35.250 --> 00:30:40.250
one of the kind of debates it's been going on at international levels when it

488
00:30:40.531 --> 00:30:45.030
comes to solving climate changes,
who's going to pay for it?
Developing countries?

489
00:30:45.390 --> 00:30:48.270
Basic stance has been for decades.
Look,

490
00:30:48.271 --> 00:30:52.960
we didn't cause the problem you caused the problem in the West,
the u s uh,

491
00:30:53.040 --> 00:30:57.390
Europe,
you should pay for it.
Um,
in one thing you see in the movie,

492
00:30:57.391 --> 00:31:00.860
you see owl kind of talking to the Indian,
um,

493
00:31:00.930 --> 00:31:04.500
environmental minister and the energy and administer about these very things in

494
00:31:04.530 --> 00:31:07.820
the debate gets very heated because people are entrenched and they,
they,

495
00:31:07.880 --> 00:31:10.890
they believe that they're in the right and that the other side should,

496
00:31:10.891 --> 00:31:12.750
should have responsibility of dealing with it.

497
00:31:13.380 --> 00:31:17.490
But evidence that things are changing and changing very fast is the fact that

498
00:31:17.491 --> 00:31:21.150
the Indians actually did end up getting,
um,
in,
uh,

499
00:31:21.180 --> 00:31:24.720
signing onto the Paris deal.
And like I mentioned before,

500
00:31:24.721 --> 00:31:26.220
and they have made this,

501
00:31:26.221 --> 00:31:31.221
you turn and in the context of international negotiations on this issue,

502
00:31:31.471 --> 00:31:34.530
which has been going on for decades,
it is incredibly dramatic.

503
00:31:34.710 --> 00:31:38.070
And we have this wonderful material in the film where you actually see it
happen,

504
00:31:38.130 --> 00:31:39.950
<v 1>Ben,
in real time.
Yeah.</v>

505
00:31:40.680 --> 00:31:45.000
<v 3>So in closing for vice rising for,
I just wanted to ask you,
you know,</v>

506
00:31:45.001 --> 00:31:47.310
speaking of this,
this pace of change,
you know,

507
00:31:47.311 --> 00:31:50.040
when you think of a decade from now,
you know,
let's say we're,

508
00:31:50.041 --> 00:31:53.130
we're back here in 20,
27.
Where do you think will be?

509
00:31:54.090 --> 00:31:58.410
<v 1>Well,
I hope we'll be able to look back on the preceding decade,</v>

510
00:31:58.411 --> 00:32:03.411
the one just to come as we are here as the time when we really did cross the

511
00:32:04.441 --> 00:32:09.270
tipping point.
Uh,
I'm in awe of the talented Pawnee and John,
uh,

512
00:32:09.820 --> 00:32:12.060
uh,
brought to the making of this movie.

513
00:32:12.061 --> 00:32:15.450
I think it tells you everything you need to know about the crisis and the

514
00:32:15.451 --> 00:32:19.380
solutions and what you can do to be a part of the solutions.

515
00:32:19.950 --> 00:32:24.950
And the movie places this climate movement in the context of the other great

516
00:32:27.150 --> 00:32:31.140
moral challenges that humanity has overcome.

517
00:32:31.141 --> 00:32:35.610
And they were mentioned earlier the,
the abolition movement a long time ago,

518
00:32:35.611 --> 00:32:40.010
but the women's suffrage movement,
the civil rights movement,
uh,

519
00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:41.030
growing up in the south,

520
00:32:41.031 --> 00:32:45.170
I can tell you the resistance to the civil rights revolution was at least as

521
00:32:45.171 --> 00:32:49.850
ferocious as the resistance to the climate movement.
Now,
um,

522
00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:52.310
the,
the,
uh,
anti apartheid movement,

523
00:32:52.340 --> 00:32:56.390
Nelson Mandela said it's always impossible until it's done.

524
00:32:56.930 --> 00:32:58.970
The gay rights movement.
Um,

525
00:32:59.060 --> 00:33:03.350
if somebody had told me five years ago,
uh,

526
00:33:03.380 --> 00:33:08.300
in the year 2017 gay marriage will be legal in all 50 states in the u s and will

527
00:33:08.301 --> 00:33:12.110
be accepted,
honored and celebrated by two thirds of the American people.

528
00:33:12.111 --> 00:33:14.900
I would have said,
well,
I sure hope so,
but what are you smoking?

529
00:33:15.290 --> 00:33:19.100
That seems completely unrealistic,
but it,

530
00:33:19.120 --> 00:33:24.120
it happened because once the underbrush is cleared away and the straw man or

531
00:33:24.981 --> 00:33:29.981
dealt with and the focus is clearly on the central choice between what's right

532
00:33:30.651 --> 00:33:31.730
and what's wrong,

533
00:33:32.090 --> 00:33:37.090
then the outcome becomes four ordained because of who we are as human beings.

534
00:33:38.900 --> 00:33:43.310
And I think the climate movement is right at that tipping point.

535
00:33:43.730 --> 00:33:47.900
And I feel pretty confident that a decade from now we will have crossed that

536
00:33:47.901 --> 00:33:48.940
point.
Uh,

537
00:33:48.950 --> 00:33:53.930
the climate denial will be sorta like the people who argue that the earth is

538
00:33:53.931 --> 00:33:54.980
flat or there,

539
00:33:54.981 --> 00:33:59.930
there's still a bunch of those ever done and that the moon landing,

540
00:33:59.931 --> 00:34:02.960
what was,
was faked on a movie lot and that kind of thing.

541
00:34:03.350 --> 00:34:07.670
But it will be a really marginal,
a point of view.

542
00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:11.030
And I think we're getting there,
but not to put the focus on them,

543
00:34:11.240 --> 00:34:15.680
but rather to put the focus on all of us who take it into our hearts,

544
00:34:15.681 --> 00:34:18.390
realize it's the right thing to do,
uh,

545
00:34:18.410 --> 00:34:21.410
and successfully resolving this is the key to,

546
00:34:21.860 --> 00:34:24.080
to redeeming our destiny as,

547
00:34:24.081 --> 00:34:27.980
as human beings and saying to the generations that follow,
we did,

548
00:34:27.981 --> 00:34:30.830
we did the right thing.
Yes.
Well,
thank,

549
00:34:30.831 --> 00:34:32.690
thank you all so much for being here with us.

550
00:34:32.691 --> 00:34:36.020
It's been truly an honor and congratulations on the film.
Thank you.

551
00:34:36.330 --> 00:34:37.980
<v 7>Thank you very much.
Thank you all for coming.</v>
