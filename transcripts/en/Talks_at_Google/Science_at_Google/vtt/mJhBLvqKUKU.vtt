1
00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:08.950
Welcome to toxic Kirkland's.
Uh,
I'd like to welcome Brian deer.

2
00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:12.490
He's the author of the book,
the friendly Orange Glow.
And the book was the first.

3
00:00:12.491 --> 00:00:15.580
It is the first to tell the story of the Pluto system and its relation to the

4
00:00:15.581 --> 00:00:18.920
dawn of cyber culture,
uh,
before becoming an author.
Uh,

5
00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:21.760
Mr deer was the founder and the chairman of eventful incorporated.

6
00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:25.810
The makers of had been full.com the world's largest event search engine.

7
00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:29.110
He was also the founding director of Ebay design labs at Ebay.

8
00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:33.790
And he's also been in,
been in management at Easel,
mp3.com flat works,

9
00:00:33.791 --> 00:00:35.860
real networks and coconut computing.

10
00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:38.320
And he actually owns the domain coconut.com I found out.

11
00:00:38.321 --> 00:00:40.570
So let's welcome Mr Brian deer.

12
00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:41.980
<v 2>So thanks for coming.</v>

13
00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.520
<v 1>So,
if this is the first historical work,
uh,</v>

14
00:00:47.521 --> 00:00:49.770
I'm assuming that a lot of people don't even know what Plato is.

15
00:00:49.771 --> 00:00:51.930
So do you mind giving us a overview?
Sure,

16
00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:54.630
<v 0>yeah.
I mean,
it,</v>

17
00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.420
it is remarkable that it is so largely unknown.
I mean,

18
00:00:58.421 --> 00:01:02.530
it was a pretty major government project that was funded by the same agencies

19
00:01:02.531 --> 00:01:07.530
that funded Arpanet.
Anything,
any takers,
Arpanet,
Arpanet,
um,
uh,

20
00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.950
Arpa and NSF or the major backers of Plato.
Um,

21
00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:16.980
the p l a t o stands for programmed logic for automatic teaching operations,

22
00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:20.140
a real tongue twister.
Um,
uh,

23
00:01:20.141 --> 00:01:25.141
the project started in 1960 and at the University of Illinois at Urbana

24
00:01:25.631 --> 00:01:29.320
Champagne.
And the idea was to,
um,

25
00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:33.280
you have to understand that this,
this was right after,
uh,
let's see,

26
00:01:33.281 --> 00:01:34.780
it would've been three years,

27
00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:39.810
basically two and a half years after Sputnik got launched by the Soviet Union.

28
00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:43.840
And that kind of freaked out the u s government and it freaked out the media and

29
00:01:43.841 --> 00:01:46.400
it freaked out a lot of politicians,
um,

30
00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:51.510
that the u s was weak in science and math and engineering education because

31
00:01:52.631 --> 00:01:55.930
clearly the Soviets beat us to launch a rocket into space.

32
00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:58.000
And so what were we going to do about this?

33
00:01:58.001 --> 00:02:03.001
And suddenly there was this massive flow of funding out of the congress starting

34
00:02:03.011 --> 00:02:08.011
at 1958 at the same time NASA was started and Arpa was started.

35
00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:13.540
And tons of fun funding started flowing into universities and companies to do

36
00:02:13.541 --> 00:02:17.970
something about improving what we would call stem education today.
Um,

37
00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.640
and the University of Illinois had a lab that had been set up during the Korean

38
00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:26.680
War called the coordinated science lab.

39
00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:28.930
Actually at the time it was called the control systems lab.

40
00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:34.260
They renamed it coordinated science lab keeping the CSL so the US government

41
00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:39.070
would have no trouble continuing to write checks,
you know,
um,
but,

42
00:02:39.071 --> 00:02:39.790
uh,

43
00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:44.020
they were trying to move away from being a military classified lab doing mainly

44
00:02:44.021 --> 00:02:48.550
research on our radar systems and air traffic control.

45
00:02:48.551 --> 00:02:50.710
Very similar to the,
uh,

46
00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:55.360
radiation lab at Mit that some of you may have heard of from World War II.

47
00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:58.540
Um,
there's lots of books on the history of that.
So anyway,

48
00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:01.630
Plato emerged with the idea,
like,

49
00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:05.810
could we do a civilian project,
uh,

50
00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:11.040
to apply a computer to be a teacher and instruct students who sit down in front

51
00:03:13.211 --> 00:03:15.400
of it on any academic subject.

52
00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.990
And it's pretty remarkable that they were doing this in 1960 only a few years

53
00:03:19.991 --> 00:03:22.360
after a psychologist,

54
00:03:22.361 --> 00:03:27.100
BF Skinner at Harvard was kicking around ideas with teaching machines.

55
00:03:27.101 --> 00:03:31.930
And the first chapter of my book is all about what he was up to and how his

56
00:03:31.931 --> 00:03:34.360
timing was really good because when Sputnik arrived,

57
00:03:34.361 --> 00:03:39.250
suddenly everyone looked at teaching machines and what was called programmed

58
00:03:39.251 --> 00:03:43.620
instruction as maybe a new way to really help,
uh,

59
00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:48.250
educate a lot more people because there weren't enough teachers and that kind of

60
00:03:48.251 --> 00:03:48.730
thing.

61
00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:53.730
So Plato started as a pure educational project to turn a computer,

62
00:03:55.571 --> 00:03:57.280
which at the time was the Iliac,

63
00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:02.280
which is one of the big old vacuum tube,
you know,
uh,

64
00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:03.730
monoliths from,

65
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.620
from the fifties when they were only a handful of computers in the world.
And,

66
00:04:08.621 --> 00:04:12.610
you know,
it would,
it would fit in this room,
but you know,
uh,
it,

67
00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:16.660
it was all vacuum,
thousands of vacuum tubes that failed,
you know,

68
00:04:16.661 --> 00:04:20.410
in a week or something like that each.
Um,
so we were constantly replacing it.

69
00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:25.150
But yeah,
so that's what Plato originally was.
What makes the story interesting?

70
00:04:25.151 --> 00:04:27.870
Is that what it became later.
Um,

71
00:04:27.871 --> 00:04:32.470
and I argue it kind of became a precursor to much of what we take for granted

72
00:04:32.471 --> 00:04:37.471
today on the net a lot before people realize was possible.

73
00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:42.360
Right.
Yeah.
So my next question was about the first that Plato wrote about,
uh,

74
00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:43.570
reading through the first part of your book.

75
00:04:43.571 --> 00:04:46.120
You talk about a lot of technological Ferris with the touch screens in the

76
00:04:46.121 --> 00:04:47.290
plasma displays and such,

77
00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:52.450
and then you move into a social and human interaction changes in the first where

78
00:04:52.451 --> 00:04:55.270
you get into the cyber culture and the social networks and things that evolved.

79
00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:55.750
Uh,

80
00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:58.300
maybe we'll start at the beginning with the technological changes and just what

81
00:04:58.301 --> 00:05:01.360
was the things that Plato with on the cutting edge and then defining adjuncts?

82
00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:06.250
Well,
it was way beyond before cutting edge.
It was like bleeding edge,
you know,

83
00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:09.200
rough,
blunt edge.
It was,
um,

84
00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:14.220
I mean they had to basically build and construct everything from scratch,

85
00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:16.360
both software and hardware.

86
00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:20.680
They had an Iliac box the size of this room.
Um,

87
00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:24.040
they didn't have any terminals.
They didn't have any graphics that they,

88
00:05:24.041 --> 00:05:28.870
they didn't have any memory.
They had no telecom capability,
noon,
no networking,

89
00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:33.850
uh,
they had no software.
Everything was machine code,
really,

90
00:05:33.851 --> 00:05:38.410
really primitive.
Just maybe one notch up from Zeros and ones,

91
00:05:38.411 --> 00:05:41.100
but it wasn't even assembly language.
And,
um,

92
00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:45.210
that's what you programmed the ILIAC can.
And so that was where they started.

93
00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:47.980
And one of the things they realized right away was,
you know,

94
00:05:47.981 --> 00:05:50.710
if you're going to teach students,
you need to have a graphical display.

95
00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:54.730
They understood that they had been exposed to projects like sage,

96
00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:58.820
which was a gigantic military,
uh,
that,
uh,

97
00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:02.900
that involved real graphical displays and had been built for billions of
dollars.

98
00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:06.050
Um,
so the technology was known.

99
00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:09.020
It was just insanely expensive and not practical.

100
00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:13.790
And just to give you guys an idea of,
of the cost compared to,

101
00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:14.690
you know,

102
00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:19.690
we now have even one person holding a smartphone in this room has more memory

103
00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:25.190
than all computers combined in the world,
probably until the 70s,
I'm guessing.
Um,

104
00:06:25.191 --> 00:06:28.520
you know,
with a few gay 16 Gig,
right?
Um,

105
00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:32.870
in the Plato,
when Plato started,
uh,

106
00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:38.180
one idea was for d the display,
they would use video ram and a CRT.

107
00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:41.660
And so they went off and bought a,
uh,
uh,

108
00:06:41.661 --> 00:06:45.920
they found a used $10 television set that the tuner was broken,

109
00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:49.760
but hey,
it had,
it was a CRT and it works.
So that's all they needed.

110
00:06:49.761 --> 00:06:53.720
They didn't need the tuner.
Um,
and,
uh,
then they were,

111
00:06:53.721 --> 00:06:57.950
we're trying to figure out how to do memory and ram in 1960,

112
00:06:57.951 --> 00:07:01.970
61 62 was $2 per bit.

113
00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:07.790
So do the math on your 16 gig phone,
right?
Or 64,

114
00:07:07.791 --> 00:07:12.290
one 28 gig phone.
Um,
we're talking a couple hundred million dollars.

115
00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:16.850
Um,
so even then to have a five,
12 by five,

116
00:07:16.851 --> 00:07:20.210
12 pixel display,
which is what the idea was,

117
00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:24.030
it was going to cost hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars.
And just,

118
00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:26.870
you know,
for students in schools that,
you know,

119
00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:30.080
when teachers can't even afford chalk to put on the blackboard,

120
00:07:30.081 --> 00:07:32.690
it just was not going to be economics weren't there.

121
00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:34.220
So they had to come up with something else.

122
00:07:34.221 --> 00:07:37.550
And what they came up with was an idea that actually had been kicked around for

123
00:07:37.551 --> 00:07:41.520
quite a while.
It turned out of using,
uh,
uh,

124
00:07:41.570 --> 00:07:44.390
gaseous discharge,
um,
uh,

125
00:07:44.391 --> 00:07:46.730
gas plasma discharge in an,

126
00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:49.490
if you built an array of conductors,

127
00:07:49.491 --> 00:07:53.290
one going vertically when going horizontally and you,
uh,

128
00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:57.350
ran electricity through any intersection of it,
of the,

129
00:07:57.351 --> 00:07:59.810
the conductors in theory,

130
00:07:59.811 --> 00:08:04.811
you could basically light up one little cell that had neon gas or some other

131
00:08:05.871 --> 00:08:07.670
kind of gas in it.
And the,

132
00:08:07.671 --> 00:08:12.671
the holy grail was can you make that a gaseous cell,

133
00:08:12.921 --> 00:08:17.090
have memory and have essentially you could send a,

134
00:08:17.091 --> 00:08:21.500
set it in such a state that it would stay lit.
And if you could do that,

135
00:08:21.501 --> 00:08:24.000
then you basically have a memory cell and,
and,

136
00:08:24.010 --> 00:08:26.480
and it would be a lot cheaper than ram and stuff like that.

137
00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:31.040
So they worked on that for years and they tried everything they could do.
They,

138
00:08:31.041 --> 00:08:35.180
they,
uh,
they wound up,
um,
uh,

139
00:08:35.181 --> 00:08:39.690
with a breakthrough in 1964.
And I talk about that in the book where they,

140
00:08:39.710 --> 00:08:42.470
they finally,
uh,
uh,

141
00:08:43.430 --> 00:08:48.230
build a single pixel,
a display.
That's all they had.

142
00:08:48.231 --> 00:08:50.840
They were using.
If,
if,
as a kid,

143
00:08:50.841 --> 00:08:54.650
you remember if you ever played with a microscope and you know the little square

144
00:08:54.651 --> 00:08:59.040
pieces of glass that you put on top of a slide and a microscope.

145
00:08:59.041 --> 00:09:01.320
And then you look at some parameciums or something,

146
00:09:01.890 --> 00:09:05.580
those little tiny thin wafer wafers of glass,

147
00:09:06.270 --> 00:09:10.260
they create a sandwich of them.
And the one,
so there were three sheets of glass.

148
00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:15.600
The one inside had a little dot drilled through it.
And that was the pixel.

149
00:09:15.601 --> 00:09:19.950
And they,
and they managed to get neon gas into it.
And,
uh,

150
00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:24.930
normally neon gas glows orange a just click a campfire,

151
00:09:25.170 --> 00:09:30.060
but some nitrogen from just normal air had leaked into the tube and it glowed

152
00:09:30.061 --> 00:09:33.150
blue.
But that was their breakthrough.
And it actually,

153
00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:38.900
if you send a certain amount of electricity through a spike and the signal and

154
00:09:39.151 --> 00:09:44.151
then you send a smaller sustaining voltage through the pixel stay lit and that

155
00:09:45.331 --> 00:09:50.331
is literally a one and you can send an then a drop in the voltage and the pixel

156
00:09:50.731 --> 00:09:53.640
go off and that's zero.
And um,

157
00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:58.290
but they had achieved memory and a display.
So,
you know,

158
00:09:58.590 --> 00:10:01.050
by 1972,
they had five,
12 by five,

159
00:10:01.051 --> 00:10:04.620
12 versions of these with orange pixels.

160
00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:09.240
And literally when you're sitting down at,
at one of these screens,

161
00:10:09.241 --> 00:10:13.710
you are viewing the memory.
There is no ram that it's,
you know,

162
00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:16.720
refreshing constantly like 60 hertz or something.
It's,

163
00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:20.670
you're looking at the memory.
So it was a pretty ingenious invention.

164
00:10:21.090 --> 00:10:22.620
And they also realized,
you know,

165
00:10:22.621 --> 00:10:27.621
if we had three pixels per pixel and we use different color phosphorous,

166
00:10:28.261 --> 00:10:31.230
we could have RGB and we could have color,
you know,

167
00:10:31.231 --> 00:10:34.050
and so they actually put that in the patent.
Um,

168
00:10:34.140 --> 00:10:37.470
so they invented plasma televisions and this and,

169
00:10:37.471 --> 00:10:40.790
and it turned out to be a really lucrative patent that,
uh,

170
00:10:41.370 --> 00:10:45.360
poured millions of dollars into University of Illinois and help fund Plato for

171
00:10:45.361 --> 00:10:49.680
many,
many years.
Uh,
lots of companies,
Fujitsu,
IBM,

172
00:10:50.010 --> 00:10:54.780
NCR,
all kinds of companies would license that patent.
Um,

173
00:10:55.290 --> 00:10:56.071
and you know,

174
00:10:56.071 --> 00:11:00.360
plasma displays wound up in everything from a checkout counters at the grocery

175
00:11:00.361 --> 00:11:02.750
store to,
uh,
you know,

176
00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:07.440
airline ticket counters and banks and nuclear submarines wanted flat panel

177
00:11:07.441 --> 00:11:11.790
displays cause the CRTs took up too much room.
So it wound up everywhere.

178
00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:16.020
So awesome.
And so the books differently,
orange glow did the,

179
00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:21.120
when did Plato switchover to the RGV display and never know because it was just

180
00:11:22.231 --> 00:11:26.010
too expensive.
And in fact,
I mean there were prototypes.

181
00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:30.180
They had colored,
uh,
uh,
displays in the lab.

182
00:11:30.210 --> 00:11:34.740
I remember seeing one in the 80s.
Um,
IBM built one,
they built like a 10,

183
00:11:34.741 --> 00:11:39.590
24 by 10,
24,
I think it was plasma color display,
but you know what,

184
00:11:39.591 --> 00:11:43.980
it would've cost $100,000 or something.
So it wasn't practical.
Um,

185
00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:48.510
it was only one Fujitsu came out with the 42 inch plasma vision,

186
00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:50.370
like in the mid nineties or something.

187
00:11:50.371 --> 00:11:54.760
That was the first plasma television that you could buy and hang on the wall.

188
00:11:54.761 --> 00:11:58.200
It would only set you back about 15 grand,
you know?
Um,
so they,

189
00:11:58.201 --> 00:12:01.990
they became dirt cheap over time,
but um,
you know,
amazing.

190
00:12:02.270 --> 00:12:06.330
So technologically it's like you said,
bleeding edge,
but then,
uh,

191
00:12:06.340 --> 00:12:09.850
it started as a teaching system and then you stayed at evolve to something else.

192
00:12:09.850 --> 00:12:12.550
It's more of a network system.
So let's talk a little bit,
I mean,

193
00:12:12.551 --> 00:12:15.400
they always had this dream of scaling the system up.
I mean,

194
00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:18.130
it's kind of funny when you look back at project,
I mean,

195
00:12:18.131 --> 00:12:21.280
you hear about scale in any startup today,
right?
I mean,

196
00:12:21.281 --> 00:12:22.930
the whole dream is you build a product,

197
00:12:22.931 --> 00:12:26.700
we build a service and you got to scale it up and you're,
you're,
you know,
you,

198
00:12:26.701 --> 00:12:28.840
you throw it into the cloud,
some cloud service,

199
00:12:29.230 --> 00:12:32.560
and you have virtual servers and it's all,
you know,
um,

200
00:12:34.060 --> 00:12:38.680
people nowadays don't realize how good they have it compared to what they were

201
00:12:38.681 --> 00:12:41.850
dealing with.
And Plato,
I mean,
one of the jokes in the Plato era,

202
00:12:41.851 --> 00:12:44.980
I heard this from people all the time when I interviewed them was,
you know,

203
00:12:45.250 --> 00:12:49.330
every bit is sacred.
And you know,
when you were coding,

204
00:12:49.690 --> 00:12:53.530
um,
you know,
a,
a program on a Plato,
you might get,
you know,

205
00:12:53.531 --> 00:12:55.060
about a thousand words of memory.

206
00:12:55.570 --> 00:12:59.430
And so you literally had to worry about allocating in,

207
00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:04.310
assigning real meaning to a single bit rather than,
you know,
oh,

208
00:13:04.311 --> 00:13:09.040
we'll just to a long two to a binary value or something.
You know,
you just,

209
00:13:09.070 --> 00:13:13.000
you did not have that luxury.
Um,
it's kind of funny.

210
00:13:13.001 --> 00:13:17.830
I think Microsoft word probably exceeded the entire cyber,

211
00:13:18.190 --> 00:13:22.330
uh,
s all of Plato,
all of its programs,

212
00:13:22.331 --> 00:13:26.980
all of its data and everything in,
in,
you know,
in footprint,
in terms of data.

213
00:13:27.270 --> 00:13:29.470
Uh,
probably years ago,
you know,

214
00:13:29.510 --> 00:13:34.510
any big APP nowadays is kind of bloated compared to what the Plato people were

215
00:13:34.541 --> 00:13:39.370
facing.
Everything was scarce and every single aspect of the system,

216
00:13:39.430 --> 00:13:43.300
uh,
you,
you really had to think carefully because it just wasn't,

217
00:13:43.750 --> 00:13:48.340
there wasn't the luxury of like,
of resources we have now.
And he said cyber,

218
00:13:48.341 --> 00:13:52.790
cyber is the operating system that ran under,
well,
yeah,
no,
what happened was,
um,

219
00:13:52.810 --> 00:13:56.740
in,
uh,
so played off,
started with the ILIAC computer,

220
00:13:57.160 --> 00:14:01.030
which was completely inadequate and all the other professors and researchers on

221
00:14:01.031 --> 00:14:04.960
campus,
we're also using that thing,
which means you had to sign up for time.

222
00:14:05.380 --> 00:14:09.760
It wasn't a timesharing system.
Um,
so you know,
you basically,

223
00:14:09.761 --> 00:14:11.770
you might get 2:00 AM or something like that.

224
00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:16.870
And the way you programmed the Iliac is that you worked on paper for days or

225
00:14:16.871 --> 00:14:18.580
maybe even weeks beforehand,

226
00:14:18.970 --> 00:14:23.970
and your time on the Iliac was actually trying to compile that program and it

227
00:14:24.431 --> 00:14:27.610
better work because if it didn't you,
you,

228
00:14:27.670 --> 00:14:30.100
you would probably blown the hour that you had.

229
00:14:30.310 --> 00:14:34.090
And so you'd have to go back through,
you know,
the equivalent of core dumps,

230
00:14:34.091 --> 00:14:37.750
I guess,
and try to figure out how to,
you know,
uh,

231
00:14:37.751 --> 00:14:41.050
where there was a bug and then the next time,

232
00:14:41.051 --> 00:14:44.110
maybe a week later or something like that,

233
00:14:44.111 --> 00:14:48.340
you might get another 2:00 AM session to run it again.
So it was insanely,

234
00:14:48.570 --> 00:14:52.330
and I add an inadequate as a development environment.
So,
uh,

235
00:14:52.350 --> 00:14:54.710
the CSL,
uh,

236
00:14:54.740 --> 00:14:59.740
put out bids for a better computer and IBM and control data both came in with

237
00:15:00.471 --> 00:15:03.360
offer,
you know,
with RFPs or whatever.
Uh,

238
00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:06.740
control data came in with a $995,000,

239
00:15:07.190 --> 00:15:11.930
a CDC 1604,
which at the time was like a pretty fast machine.

240
00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:16.340
Uh,
IBM came in with big iron machines,
uh,

241
00:15:16.460 --> 00:15:20.180
for about a million dollars.
When they saw that CDC was like five bucks less.

242
00:15:20.810 --> 00:15:22.010
They said,
oh,
well,
okay,

243
00:15:22.011 --> 00:15:26.210
we'll sell it to you for $500,000 a control data came back and told the

244
00:15:26.211 --> 00:15:27.044
university,

245
00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:32.500
ours is nine 95 from a so IBM came back and said,

246
00:15:32.660 --> 00:15:37.520
we'll sell it to you for $250,000 and control database came back and said,
no,

247
00:15:37.521 --> 00:15:42.500
ours is still $995,000.
Uh,
long story short,
the University of Illinois,

248
00:15:42.501 --> 00:15:46.340
I bought the control data machine for $995,000.

249
00:15:46.670 --> 00:15:51.080
Ibm was furious,
sued and did all the typical stuff that companies do.

250
00:15:51.380 --> 00:15:55.610
Wound up in a huge battle in the state legislature.
Um,

251
00:15:56.140 --> 00:15:58.850
you know,
when all the dust settled,
IBM was,

252
00:15:58.930 --> 00:16:03.650
it went off very upset and control data got the deal and that kind of changed

253
00:16:03.651 --> 00:16:06.650
the whole history of Plato from then on because,
um,

254
00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:11.680
the first thing they did was build an Iliac emulator in the 1604.

255
00:16:13.220 --> 00:16:16.430
So there were back to running iliac again,

256
00:16:16.460 --> 00:16:20.480
but it was all emulate it and it was much faster and they had time and then they

257
00:16:20.481 --> 00:16:24.320
started knowing all the professors around campus yet again because Plato was

258
00:16:24.321 --> 00:16:28.520
starting to consume way too much of its time.
And uh,
so,
uh,

259
00:16:28.521 --> 00:16:32.870
in a couple of years they got a,
uh,
a second 1604 for a dollar.

260
00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:38.440
And that really sealed the fate of Plato because from then on they basically had

261
00:16:39.561 --> 00:16:44.030
a relationship with control data that was the architecture for the rest of time.

262
00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:46.700
And by the early seventies,
they were,

263
00:16:46.730 --> 00:16:50.690
they had always had this dream of scale to get up to thousands of simultaneous

264
00:16:50.691 --> 00:16:55.600
users.
Um,
by then,
CDC had a real supercomputer,
um,
the,

265
00:16:55.610 --> 00:16:59.840
the,
the cyber,
uh,
6,400 6,600 series,

266
00:17:00.620 --> 00:17:04.190
massive mainframes,
very multimillion dollar machines.

267
00:17:04.580 --> 00:17:07.400
And they bought one for Plato.
And that's what,
uh,

268
00:17:07.790 --> 00:17:10.940
Plato started running on around 71 72.

269
00:17:12.020 --> 00:17:15.720
And that's when things got weird because,
um,

270
00:17:15.830 --> 00:17:19.730
by then the,
uh,
the lab,

271
00:17:19.731 --> 00:17:24.560
it got much bigger.
Um,
there was a huge influx of people and this,

272
00:17:24.561 --> 00:17:27.750
this lab was very unusual and I don't think they were,

273
00:17:27.980 --> 00:17:31.730
I'm not aware of another lab in the 70s,

274
00:17:31.790 --> 00:17:35.930
a computer lab on a university campus in the United States that would have been

275
00:17:35.931 --> 00:17:40.790
similar to this.
Um,
every other one I've heard of,
MIT,

276
00:17:40.850 --> 00:17:45.200
Stanford,
whatever,
they were pretty locked down places and you'd have,

277
00:17:45.230 --> 00:17:46.910
you had to have access to get in.

278
00:17:47.330 --> 00:17:51.360
And so they were limited and you didn't have a bunch of kids come ring the local

279
00:17:51.361 --> 00:17:55.470
high schools wandering into the building.
Um,
if you tried to do that,

280
00:17:55.471 --> 00:17:58.350
you'd probably get kicked out and your parents would probably get called,

281
00:17:58.351 --> 00:18:02.430
you know,
that kind of thing.
But at the University of Illinois,
at the Plato Lab,

282
00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:03.090
um,

283
00:18:03.090 --> 00:18:07.440
they encourage people to wander in and there just happened to be a high school

284
00:18:07.441 --> 00:18:09.330
across the street.
And sure enough,

285
00:18:09.331 --> 00:18:14.331
all the geeks from that school just wandered into Plato saw these incredibly

286
00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:17.040
amazing,
you know,
five,
12 by five,

287
00:18:17.041 --> 00:18:21.960
12 graphics displays had built in touch screens on them and people were doing

288
00:18:21.961 --> 00:18:24.120
amazing things with graphics.
You know,

289
00:18:24.121 --> 00:18:27.960
in 72 and 73 and they were not getting kicked out.
In fact,

290
00:18:27.961 --> 00:18:30.000
they were encouraged to sit down and start programming.

291
00:18:30.450 --> 00:18:33.820
So a lot of them learn how to code.
And uh,

292
00:18:33.870 --> 00:18:35.550
starting around 1973,

293
00:18:35.551 --> 00:18:40.551
there was this amazing 12 month period where the whole Plato system really

294
00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:45.780
completely changed in nature.
It had been all about education.

295
00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:47.760
The kids,
ironically,

296
00:18:47.761 --> 00:18:52.230
the recipients of the education that they were supposed to get out of playdough

297
00:18:52.710 --> 00:18:57.390
took one look at it and saw that the development environment and realize,

298
00:18:57.450 --> 00:19:02.400
you know,
we could do other kinds of things with this,
including,
you know,

299
00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:06.600
inter-terminal kinds of things,
including interpersonal kinds of things.

300
00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:11.700
So chat rooms started up,
um,
there was an app called Talkomatic,

301
00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:16.800
um,
instant messaging,
uh,
fired up in,
in December of [inaudible] 73,

302
00:19:17.130 --> 00:19:20.190
um,
email and,
uh,
what were called notes files,

303
00:19:20.191 --> 00:19:23.490
which are the equivalent of message board or it's a message forums,

304
00:19:23.491 --> 00:19:27.040
use net and that kind of thing.
All those things started.
Uh,

305
00:19:27.190 --> 00:19:32.190
there was an online newspaper and then there was a whole raft of a nonstop games

306
00:19:33.510 --> 00:19:37.050
being built.
And these were all multiplayer multiuser games,

307
00:19:37.380 --> 00:19:41.510
muds and Dungeon Games.
They were all graphical.
Um,

308
00:19:42.150 --> 00:19:47.150
and all this started by the teenagers from the high schools and an undergrads.

309
00:19:47.460 --> 00:19:51.300
It was never part of the National Science Foundation Mission to,
you know,

310
00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:55.980
build off this recreational social stuff.
But you know,

311
00:19:56.730 --> 00:20:01.140
what struck me,
and it only struck me after I finished writing the book was that,

312
00:20:01.141 --> 00:20:01.351
you know,

313
00:20:01.351 --> 00:20:06.351
if you look at this history that's laid out of this project and you see what

314
00:20:07.771 --> 00:20:11.720
they built so early,
um,
you realize that the,
you know,
I,

315
00:20:11.721 --> 00:20:13.840
I kind of describe it as,
um,

316
00:20:14.070 --> 00:20:19.050
the interpersonal computer revolution.
Um,

317
00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:24.020
uh,
started before the personal computer revolution ever started.
You know,

318
00:20:24.030 --> 00:20:28.380
before apple was incorporated before,
uh,
the Altair was out,

319
00:20:28.381 --> 00:20:33.360
I think certainly before Microsoft was incorporated.
Um,
I'll put it another way.

320
00:20:33.361 --> 00:20:37.430
While Larry and Sergey were still in diapers,
um,
uh,

321
00:20:37.590 --> 00:20:40.570
Plato was booming with this online culture,
um,

322
00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:45.270
that had all the kind of apps that got people addicted.
And they were,
you know,

323
00:20:45.510 --> 00:20:46.090
they're,
they,

324
00:20:46.090 --> 00:20:51.090
they were having the rush in 1973 that we hear talked about today with social

325
00:20:51.701 --> 00:20:52.534
networks.

326
00:20:52.780 --> 00:20:57.310
And Twitter and Facebook and a Google plus,
you know,

327
00:20:57.620 --> 00:21:02.350
um,
uh,
but,
uh,
yeah,

328
00:21:02.370 --> 00:21:03.203
it,

329
00:21:03.210 --> 00:21:07.630
it's just a remarkable because there's no computer history book.

330
00:21:07.870 --> 00:21:12.160
There's no museum that has a timeline that shows that,
you know,

331
00:21:12.161 --> 00:21:17.161
all this advanced stuff was going on really early then it kind of,

332
00:21:17.530 --> 00:21:20.170
you know,
and it didn't really even die off.

333
00:21:20.171 --> 00:21:22.390
It just was a parallel universe almost.

334
00:21:22.810 --> 00:21:27.220
That very strangely got ignored.
And,
um,

335
00:21:27.460 --> 00:21:28.360
you know,
uh,

336
00:21:28.990 --> 00:21:33.730
how many of you show of hands have ever heard of the book hackers heroes of the

337
00:21:33.731 --> 00:21:37.370
computer revolution by Steve Leavey?
Good.
Well,
the,

338
00:21:37.371 --> 00:21:41.200
those who haven't get it,
it's worth it.
It's a,
it's a great book.

339
00:21:41.230 --> 00:21:45.030
It's a great story.
Came out in 1984.
It's still in print.
Um,

340
00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:46.900
I think Riley has a printout now.

341
00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:50.590
It's what inspired me to do this book cause I always felt,
you know,

342
00:21:50.591 --> 00:21:54.550
the first thing I did when I bought that was I rushed to open the index and look

343
00:21:54.551 --> 00:21:59.500
under p for Plato,
Nada.
And there has,

344
00:21:59.530 --> 00:22:02.310
and that's the way it's been ever since.
Um,

345
00:22:02.740 --> 00:22:05.950
even Walter Isaacson's recent book,

346
00:22:05.951 --> 00:22:09.130
the innovators doesn't have a single mention of Plato in it,

347
00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:13.330
which is absolutely remarkable.
Um,
but then at the sea,

348
00:22:13.350 --> 00:22:17.770
so on the one hand I'm kind of frustrated and I want to like,
you know,

349
00:22:17.771 --> 00:22:20.650
rant at them for like,
why didn't you,
you know,
blah,
blah,
blah.

350
00:22:20.980 --> 00:22:23.200
But on the other hand,
what we're,

351
00:22:23.201 --> 00:22:27.220
what resources did they have to even know about Plato?
If you,

352
00:22:27.550 --> 00:22:31.960
if you didn't know someone or if you didn't use it yourself,
it really was a,

353
00:22:31.961 --> 00:22:36.340
you had to be there kind of thing,
which is really unfortunate.
I mean,
you know,

354
00:22:36.390 --> 00:22:40.960
uh,
probably me,
I'm assuming none of us here were at Xerox Park,

355
00:22:41.260 --> 00:22:46.150
but we probably mostly know about that history.
It's been well documented.

356
00:22:46.151 --> 00:22:48.640
It's been great books about it,
and it,
you know,

357
00:22:48.641 --> 00:22:52.050
it profoundly influenced the industry.
You know,
the,

358
00:22:52.051 --> 00:22:56.740
the Lisa and the Macintosh and windows and all that stuff.
Um,
and they're,

359
00:22:56.741 --> 00:22:58.180
you know,
there's been great books about that,

360
00:22:58.181 --> 00:22:59.590
but there's never been a book about Plato.

361
00:22:59.591 --> 00:23:03.970
So I always felt that it was desperately needed so that we can get Plato into

362
00:23:03.971 --> 00:23:06.150
the conversation.
And,
uh,

363
00:23:06.250 --> 00:23:09.730
no longer live in a world that's kind of ignorant of it because it's pretty

364
00:23:09.731 --> 00:23:13.690
remarkable.
So you have a passion for it and an interest in it,

365
00:23:13.691 --> 00:23:16.570
and there's no books about it.
So you had to discover it somewhere.
So what,
what,

366
00:23:17.350 --> 00:23:21.730
how did you meet Plato,
I guess?
Um,
well,
I,
I,

367
00:23:21.860 --> 00:23:26.680
I come from five generations of newspaper publishers and editors.
Um,

368
00:23:27.070 --> 00:23:30.940
uh,
my father's father,
his father's father,

369
00:23:30.941 --> 00:23:33.550
his father's felt going back to like 1850.

370
00:23:33.970 --> 00:23:36.280
They owned The Jersey City Journal,

371
00:23:36.700 --> 00:23:41.560
which was the second largest paper in the New York Metro area.
You know,

372
00:23:42.010 --> 00:23:44.590
um,
I think it's still around,
but anyway,
um,

373
00:23:44.900 --> 00:23:48.260
so I grew up in a household of like 10 daily newspapers.

374
00:23:48.261 --> 00:23:52.100
My hands were always black from the ink.
You know,
I loved reading newspapers.

375
00:23:52.101 --> 00:23:56.780
I was a Watergate junkie as a kid.
Um,
and,
uh,

376
00:23:57.140 --> 00:24:01.070
so I entered the University of Delaware as a freshman in 1979 with the idea,

377
00:24:01.160 --> 00:24:05.330
I guess I'll be English slash journalism and maybe,
you know,

378
00:24:05.630 --> 00:24:09.330
go work in a newspaper,
you know,
that was the family business.
And,
um,

379
00:24:09.770 --> 00:24:13.710
I was wandering around campus literally the first week I was there of walking

380
00:24:13.730 --> 00:24:17.120
through the music building.
And there was a room that I just,

381
00:24:17.180 --> 00:24:21.810
you know how in a lot of university,
uh,
uh,

382
00:24:21.890 --> 00:24:25.100
classrooms,
there'll be a door to the classroom entrance,

383
00:24:25.310 --> 00:24:26.780
but then there's like a glass window,

384
00:24:26.781 --> 00:24:28.850
Florida ceiling and you can kind of look in,
right?

385
00:24:29.450 --> 00:24:32.150
Well the lights were off in this room,
but I saw that the,

386
00:24:32.151 --> 00:24:36.560
all these faces were in there sitting down and terminals with their headphones

387
00:24:36.561 --> 00:24:40.040
on and they were all like reaching out and touching the screen like that.

388
00:24:40.580 --> 00:24:45.580
And I'm looking at it and there's very crisp high resolution graphics depiction

389
00:24:46.371 --> 00:24:49.670
of musical notation.
And then there's a keyboard,

390
00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:52.820
like a piano keyboard at the bottom of the screen and they're all like

391
00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:55.550
interacting.
They're clearly listening to the music they're playing.

392
00:24:55.950 --> 00:24:59.510
And I was pretty impressed cause I mean,
I thought,
you know,

393
00:24:59.570 --> 00:25:04.550
seventies computing was like scrolling Ascii or VT 100 if you're lucky,

394
00:25:04.551 --> 00:25:09.530
you know.
Um,
so I went in and they didn't kick me out.
Um,

395
00:25:10.670 --> 00:25:13.850
I checked it out.
There was a big poster on the wall saying,
welcome to Plato.

396
00:25:14.060 --> 00:25:18.890
I had no idea what it was.
And um,
I found out real fast.
I mean I felt,
you know,

397
00:25:18.891 --> 00:25:22.710
I sat down and within a few minutes I hear there's,
you know,

398
00:25:22.850 --> 00:25:26.930
someone's cracking up laughing at another terminal and you know,

399
00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:31.960
I wasn't used to the idea that people would laugh at something on a computer and

400
00:25:32.450 --> 00:25:35.660
they were chatting with somebody and then someone that was someone else was

401
00:25:35.661 --> 00:25:40.310
reading a hilarious message that someone had posted and one of the notes files.

402
00:25:40.690 --> 00:25:42.020
And there were,
and,
and,
and then I,

403
00:25:42.050 --> 00:25:44.810
it dawned on me that they weren't all their learning.

404
00:25:44.811 --> 00:25:48.650
They were a lot of more interacting with people on the other side of the screen

405
00:25:48.860 --> 00:25:52.610
somewhere else on the campus.
Or I didn't,
I didn't know how far this extended,

406
00:25:53.030 --> 00:25:54.040
you know,
they,

407
00:25:54.230 --> 00:25:58.760
there were other people out there using terminals two and then it dawned on me

408
00:25:58.761 --> 00:26:02.030
that University of Delaware was kind of like this remote island.

409
00:26:02.031 --> 00:26:04.430
It wasn't the cool place that,
you know,

410
00:26:04.431 --> 00:26:07.130
the cool place was the University of Illinois,

411
00:26:07.460 --> 00:26:09.470
which was where Plato had started.

412
00:26:09.890 --> 00:26:14.890
And then I discovered that the Delaware Plato system was connected kind of like

413
00:26:15.661 --> 00:26:17.750
an a poor man's internet.

414
00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:22.960
It had a dedicated link to a control data Plato system in Minneapolis,

415
00:26:23.301 --> 00:26:24.950
which connected to Illinois.

416
00:26:25.340 --> 00:26:29.810
And then there were other systems around the world and Canada and Europe,
uh,

417
00:26:29.811 --> 00:26:31.730
all the way down in South Africa.

418
00:26:32.180 --> 00:26:36.480
And most of them were interconnected and you could send email to anybody and,

419
00:26:36.580 --> 00:26:40.720
and that just kind of blew me away.
Um,
so yeah,
the,
the,

420
00:26:40.730 --> 00:26:45.360
the degree in English slash journalism lasted about a week and then it was

421
00:26:45.361 --> 00:26:48.570
pretty much a degree in,
played out since then,
so.
Awesome.

422
00:26:49.170 --> 00:26:50.490
And so at the,

423
00:26:50.491 --> 00:26:53.220
at the time when you met Plato were first started using player then it was

424
00:26:53.221 --> 00:26:55.820
already a worldwide network.
Oh,
yeah.
Yeah.
I mean,
I,

425
00:26:55.821 --> 00:26:59.670
I had nothing to do with building the system or anything.
I was just a user and,

426
00:26:59.690 --> 00:27:04.080
um,
I just couldn't believe that this thing was so cool and,
you know,
uh,

427
00:27:04.330 --> 00:27:05.970
and it would,

428
00:27:05.971 --> 00:27:10.950
it also did was completely spoil me from the microcomputer revolution,

429
00:27:10.951 --> 00:27:14.910
which was raging at the time that I,
apple two was out of the Commodore Peck.

430
00:27:15.300 --> 00:27:17.550
Pat had come out,
um,

431
00:27:18.210 --> 00:27:21.930
I guess the TRS 80 or whatever was called from radio shack.

432
00:27:21.931 --> 00:27:26.250
And then the IBM PC came out in 81,
you know,
the Lisa came out,
um,

433
00:27:26.430 --> 00:27:29.850
and a few years later,
and then the Mac and,
you know,

434
00:27:29.851 --> 00:27:31.350
I looked at all this stuff and it's like,

435
00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:36.030
why would anyone want to sit down at a lonely,
disconnected,
you know,

436
00:27:36.060 --> 00:27:38.580
kind of toy computer.

437
00:27:39.030 --> 00:27:41.220
There's no people in that box.

438
00:27:41.520 --> 00:27:45.600
There's no way to chat and interconnect with them.
The,
you know,
there's,

439
00:27:45.601 --> 00:27:47.640
there's nothing,
there's nothing addictive about it.

440
00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:52.770
And yet they were all addicted to pcs.
And I'm like,
but look at this.
This is,

441
00:27:52.771 --> 00:27:57.000
Plato is much more interesting.
This is the future that's like,
Eh,
you know,

442
00:27:57.150 --> 00:28:00.980
future people.
The people is the killer APP.
You know,
I think Plato,

443
00:28:00.990 --> 00:28:05.820
people understood that from day one.
Um,
and,
uh,

444
00:28:05.821 --> 00:28:08.880
I arrived late on the scene,
but,
you know,

445
00:28:08.881 --> 00:28:11.250
I immediately picked up on it and I saw it.
This,

446
00:28:11.251 --> 00:28:15.900
this was clearly going to be the future or our doom or both.

447
00:28:15.930 --> 00:28:20.670
You know,
and I,
I think we're,
I think we can agree.
It's both.
You know,
so,

448
00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:25.440
oops,
oops.
Now I just,
uh,
but,
uh,

449
00:28:26.310 --> 00:28:30.660
so,
yeah,
no problem.
So,
uh,
whereas Plato now,

450
00:28:30.690 --> 00:28:33.780
like is it still operable?
Uh,
well,
you know,
it's,

451
00:28:33.781 --> 00:28:37.800
it's like any of these vintage kinds of things.
Um,
it's,

452
00:28:37.830 --> 00:28:42.440
it's still running,
um,
as an emulated environment.
Uh,

453
00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:44.580
on some Intel box somewhere,

454
00:28:44.910 --> 00:28:49.470
there is a website you can all go to cyber one.org.

455
00:28:49.471 --> 00:28:54.000
That's CYB are then the number one.
Dot.
Orgi um,

456
00:28:54.060 --> 00:28:54.801
and,
uh,

457
00:28:54.801 --> 00:28:59.801
a bunch of a former Plato engineers have kept all the software around.

458
00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:00.480
Um,

459
00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:04.350
they got permission from the University of Illinois to take the entire catalog

460
00:29:04.351 --> 00:29:09.351
of many thousands of hours of educational lessons and stuff and the games and

461
00:29:09.940 --> 00:29:12.660
all the,
all the famous games,
um,

462
00:29:13.500 --> 00:29:16.120
which we probably audit to spend a moment about because,
uh,
the,

463
00:29:16.190 --> 00:29:18.840
the games themselves are remarkable.

464
00:29:18.920 --> 00:29:23.220
They're so many of them are the precursors to things that would come later that

465
00:29:23.221 --> 00:29:26.790
would be hugely famous.
And you name it,
the type of game,

466
00:29:26.820 --> 00:29:31.360
the certain design aspects of games,
you know,
uh,
the,

467
00:29:31.370 --> 00:29:34.830
the first graphical d and d games.
We're clearly on Plato.

468
00:29:35.100 --> 00:29:38.220
There was a game called d and d that was out in like 75.

469
00:29:38.550 --> 00:29:41.500
Moria came out and around 75,
76,

470
00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:46.300
which I played all the time.
It's,
it's still an incredible game.
It's on cyber.

471
00:29:46.301 --> 00:29:51.301
One avatar came out and I have a whole chapter about all the dungeon games

472
00:29:51.521 --> 00:29:53.600
called into the dungeon.
Um,

473
00:29:53.620 --> 00:29:57.700
which is avatar was remarkable because,
um,

474
00:29:58.930 --> 00:30:02.710
it was incredibly sophisticated.
And what you started seeing,

475
00:30:02.740 --> 00:30:05.230
and this is also kind of interesting,
you know,

476
00:30:05.231 --> 00:30:08.500
in the startup world today or the APP culture as it were,
you know,

477
00:30:08.890 --> 00:30:10.420
everybody has an idea.

478
00:30:10.450 --> 00:30:14.680
You go quickly develop an APP for a smartphone and you maybe get some VC money

479
00:30:14.681 --> 00:30:17.650
and you know,
have your role at the dice.

480
00:30:17.651 --> 00:30:21.100
Maybe you'll get lucky and get rich or whatever.
Um,

481
00:30:21.370 --> 00:30:25.540
so many apps today are built as reactions to,
I would argue,

482
00:30:26.260 --> 00:30:29.200
similar apps that have that predated and that you,

483
00:30:29.210 --> 00:30:34.000
you have an idea for smarter,
faster,
better,
whatever your thing is.

484
00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:36.150
That's,
you know,
er,
um,

485
00:30:36.550 --> 00:30:39.010
that's going to improve upon what was built before.

486
00:30:39.011 --> 00:30:44.011
And I would argue Google is a reaction to infoseek lycos and all the inadequate

487
00:30:45.671 --> 00:30:48.110
search engines of the 90s.
Right.
Um,

488
00:30:48.130 --> 00:30:53.130
page rank was the big breakthrough and Facebook is clearly reaction to my space,

489
00:30:53.141 --> 00:30:55.340
which was a reaction to Friendster.

490
00:30:55.420 --> 00:30:59.800
And you just keep going back to like a six degrees.com or something if anybody

491
00:30:59.801 --> 00:31:03.940
was remit remembers that thing.
But,
um,
uh,

492
00:31:04.180 --> 00:31:07.810
so you know,
that that's often the way it was.
And the same thing was happening.

493
00:31:07.811 --> 00:31:11.140
That pattern was happening on Plato.
You know,

494
00:31:11.141 --> 00:31:14.950
some kid would develop a game the next weekend,

495
00:31:14.951 --> 00:31:17.350
some other kid would have said,
oh,
I have a better idea.

496
00:31:17.351 --> 00:31:19.840
We'll change this and that,
and they'd come out with a game.

497
00:31:20.140 --> 00:31:21.460
And so it was kind of like the

498
00:31:22.990 --> 00:31:27.670
billboard top 40 of hit apps as it were,
you know,
um,

499
00:31:28.090 --> 00:31:28.330
uh,

500
00:31:28.330 --> 00:31:33.330
every week or even every day there'd be something new that was building upon and

501
00:31:33.581 --> 00:31:37.300
improving upon some previous game or whatever.

502
00:31:37.690 --> 00:31:41.200
And by the mid to late seventies,
um,

503
00:31:41.710 --> 00:31:46.710
some of these high school kids were spending four years coding the game before

504
00:31:47.621 --> 00:31:48.371
they were release it.

505
00:31:48.371 --> 00:31:52.390
Avatar didn't release until about [inaudible] 79 they started working on it and

506
00:31:52.391 --> 00:31:53.290
like 75,

507
00:31:53.291 --> 00:31:58.291
76 when they were 13 years old and they wrote this entire operating system.

508
00:31:59.180 --> 00:31:59.531
In fact,

509
00:31:59.531 --> 00:32:04.531
they literally had operators who were to manage the data and all kinds of things

510
00:32:05.591 --> 00:32:08.470
that were going on behind the scenes to manage the game cause it was so

511
00:32:08.471 --> 00:32:11.530
complicated.
And um,
you know,

512
00:32:11.560 --> 00:32:16.360
that had been built upon all the designs and thinkings of all the games that

513
00:32:16.600 --> 00:32:20.630
came before it.
And,
um,
it was just remarkable.
And,

514
00:32:20.631 --> 00:32:22.030
and then it would be years later,

515
00:32:22.031 --> 00:32:27.031
we would start seeing the same pattern emerge with the web and with mobile apps

516
00:32:27.851 --> 00:32:31.660
today until I think actually we're going to open it up for questions from the

517
00:32:31.661 --> 00:32:36.040
audience too.
I,
if anybody has a question,
please go over to the mic and ask away.

518
00:32:36.490 --> 00:32:40.010
Otherwise I have similar so that,
yeah,
please.
Thank you so much for

519
00:32:40.010 --> 00:32:44.630
<v 1>the talk and thank you so much for your time.
Um,
my question is,
so if you,</v>

520
00:32:44.660 --> 00:32:48.080
so what you're suggesting is things like,
let's say AOL instant messenger,

521
00:32:48.081 --> 00:32:49.230
rhetorics,
maintenance messaging,

522
00:32:49.540 --> 00:32:54.170
a ubiquitous was basically available 30 years for that,
right?

523
00:32:54.740 --> 00:32:59.600
That to me suggests like a conspiracy somewhere that basically suppressed the

524
00:32:59.601 --> 00:33:04.100
ideas that came out of Plato.
So then start recognize today as mainstream ideas.

525
00:33:04.460 --> 00:33:05.990
So is that true or is it,

526
00:33:06.050 --> 00:33:09.940
<v 0>well,
a couple of comments.
One,
um,
uh,</v>

527
00:33:10.070 --> 00:33:13.970
if you've ever heard of the phrase patent troll,
um,

528
00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:19.000
what's interesting about Plato is that it is the motherload of prior art.

529
00:33:19.910 --> 00:33:22.520
So,
um,
in fact,
I've,

530
00:33:22.521 --> 00:33:27.500
I've a couple of times been retained by attorneys for gigantic companies,

531
00:33:27.501 --> 00:33:31.460
including Google that were sued by trolls.
I just realized,
yeah,

532
00:33:31.461 --> 00:33:34.430
Google was one of the defendants in this giant,

533
00:33:34.431 --> 00:33:39.320
ridiculous case of some crazy patent that no one had ever built the thing.

534
00:33:39.321 --> 00:33:41.270
And they'd been selling it,
selling it,
selling it,

535
00:33:41.271 --> 00:33:45.350
and then somebody owned it and they tried to troll all the big companies.

536
00:33:45.860 --> 00:33:48.800
Um,
and oftentimes the attorneys would go like,

537
00:33:49.460 --> 00:33:51.350
this is a job for Plato,
you know,

538
00:33:51.560 --> 00:33:56.210
because they knew that like somebody did it back.
Some kid did this very thing,

539
00:33:56.660 --> 00:34:01.430
you know,
in like 1973 and sure enough,
um,
in that one case,

540
00:34:01.431 --> 00:34:05.090
I remember I was involved in,
we were literally two days away.

541
00:34:05.090 --> 00:34:10.040
We are making all the arrangements to truck a vintage,
uh,

542
00:34:10.370 --> 00:34:14.420
terminal.
Probably one of the ones that the living computer museum here in town,

543
00:34:14.840 --> 00:34:19.130
uh,
down to East Marshall,
Texas or wherever,

544
00:34:19.131 --> 00:34:23.030
that infamous courthouses that does all the patent troll cases,

545
00:34:23.031 --> 00:34:26.810
the United States.
Um,
Hi Marshall.
Um,
but,
uh,

546
00:34:27.920 --> 00:34:30.860
apparently,
uh,
when they heard that,
you know,

547
00:34:30.861 --> 00:34:35.420
I was going to give testimony and a demo of Plato and that I had been this

548
00:34:35.421 --> 00:34:39.680
author of this book that was coming out and,
you know,
um,
that cost a settlement,

549
00:34:39.681 --> 00:34:42.410
like,
like that,
you know,
so,
um,

550
00:34:42.440 --> 00:34:45.470
it was unfortunate because that was really looking forward to demoing Plato to a

551
00:34:45.471 --> 00:34:50.010
jury in Texas.
It would have been cool.
But,
um,
yeah,
so that,

552
00:34:50.011 --> 00:34:54.470
that happened a lot.
So there's a lot of cases where,
um,
uh,

553
00:34:55.730 --> 00:34:57.690
there's,
there are,
you know,

554
00:34:57.830 --> 00:35:02.580
predecessors on Plato for things that would become commercial later.
Um,

555
00:35:02.630 --> 00:35:06.140
and there are many cases that,
one of the things,
uh,

556
00:35:06.820 --> 00:35:09.230
it's important understand that when Plato was,

557
00:35:10.310 --> 00:35:13.910
the community was doing all this stuff in the early,
mid,
late seventies,

558
00:35:14.270 --> 00:35:17.450
that was a time before there were software patents.

559
00:35:17.930 --> 00:35:22.220
There was no method patent or,
or anything like that for software.

560
00:35:22.221 --> 00:35:26.300
You could patent hardware and physical things,
but they hadn't yet.

561
00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:31.100
I not,
I can't remember what year the software patents kicked in,
but,

562
00:35:31.130 --> 00:35:35.270
um,
so that mindset didn't really exist.
And there was also,

563
00:35:35.720 --> 00:35:39.090
since this was all on a university campus,
um,

564
00:35:39.091 --> 00:35:42.300
it was all an educational and not for profit kind of thing.

565
00:35:42.690 --> 00:35:47.610
So the motivation for all these kids that developed all these cool things was,

566
00:35:47.640 --> 00:35:50.430
you know,
fame and glory online.
I mean,

567
00:35:50.431 --> 00:35:54.180
that was what they lived for and they got it in droves.
You know,
they,
they,

568
00:35:54.330 --> 00:35:58.110
some of these people were like literally net dot celebrities before that term

569
00:35:58.410 --> 00:36:00.860
existed,
you know.
Um,
and,

570
00:36:00.900 --> 00:36:05.780
and just to give you a sense of how strange it was that,
you know,

571
00:36:05.970 --> 00:36:09.840
Plato in a way I,
I sometimes liken it to the Galapagos.

572
00:36:10.260 --> 00:36:14.730
It was a protected ecosystem that developed on its own.

573
00:36:15.300 --> 00:36:20.280
Much of the rest of the world completely paid at zero tension and yet,

574
00:36:20.310 --> 00:36:24.130
and so it didn't have any predators as it were.
And it was also a,
uh,

575
00:36:24.150 --> 00:36:28.740
I guess you'd say from a network perspective,
uh,
uh,
uh,

576
00:36:28.770 --> 00:36:30.990
homogenous network.
Um,

577
00:36:31.020 --> 00:36:34.320
they were just Plato terminals connected over the network so they didn't have to

578
00:36:34.321 --> 00:36:38.820
worry about interoperability.
Um,
one quick anecdote that,

579
00:36:38.850 --> 00:36:43.440
that again,
will shed light on how obscure Plato became.
Um,

580
00:36:43.470 --> 00:36:48.420
for years I was poking around looking through the RFC documents,

581
00:36:48.421 --> 00:36:50.820
if you're familiar with them,
the request for comments,

582
00:36:50.821 --> 00:36:54.720
there's thousands of them that formed the basis for all the specking that was

583
00:36:54.721 --> 00:36:55.950
done to build the Internet.

584
00:36:56.550 --> 00:37:01.550
And RFC 600 was always missing from every single repository.

585
00:37:02.370 --> 00:37:04.680
And literally as of the early two thousands,

586
00:37:05.960 --> 00:37:09.540
there were probably 50 RFC repositories on the line by then.

587
00:37:10.020 --> 00:37:12.480
And every single one was missing number 600.

588
00:37:13.110 --> 00:37:17.490
By then there were several thousand RFCs and I could never find RFC 600.

589
00:37:17.670 --> 00:37:20.190
And the reason I was looking for it cause it had to do with Plato.

590
00:37:20.880 --> 00:37:24.420
And so someone finally said,
Oh,

591
00:37:24.421 --> 00:37:27.320
you need to talk to this guy who wrote it.
He's at,

592
00:37:27.330 --> 00:37:30.030
he's in Santa Barbara somewhere.
He's probably retired.

593
00:37:30.360 --> 00:37:35.130
So I tracked him down and he had a nice big long chuckle and he told me,
yeah,

594
00:37:35.131 --> 00:37:37.560
the RFC 600,
uh,

595
00:37:37.561 --> 00:37:42.561
was a proposal to connect what they called an Illinois plasma terminal to the

596
00:37:42.751 --> 00:37:46.290
Arpanet.
And so I asked the guy,
why would you want to do that?

597
00:37:46.680 --> 00:37:51.540
And he said to play the Games,
which I just thought that was a perfect response.

598
00:37:51.540 --> 00:37:52.920
You know,
it was like,
you know,

599
00:37:52.921 --> 00:37:57.270
they were bored doing this stuff on the arpanet that they could get access to

600
00:37:57.271 --> 00:37:59.430
and they were probably tell netting and do long all the rest.

601
00:37:59.850 --> 00:38:04.530
But they heard word that all the cool stuff was on Plato.
And,
uh,

602
00:38:04.531 --> 00:38:08.560
unfortunately,
you know,
the packet network architecture of,
of,

603
00:38:08.630 --> 00:38:13.620
of Arpanet and internet later was anathema to Plato's,

604
00:38:13.680 --> 00:38:18.680
uh,
uh,
communications protocol,
which was designed again,
every bit as sacred.

605
00:38:18.840 --> 00:38:22.440
The notion of a packet would be so wasteful.
All that overhead,

606
00:38:22.441 --> 00:38:23.790
all those bits that,

607
00:38:23.810 --> 00:38:28.020
or it could be used for data and they're just used for a dressing.
It's like,

608
00:38:28.200 --> 00:38:32.530
are you nuts?
You know?
So again,
it's,
you know,
um,

609
00:38:32.670 --> 00:38:37.670
everything was designed for speed on Plato 1200 bit per second serial or modem

610
00:38:39.041 --> 00:38:43.730
connections and uh,
you know,
so it was a very different thing.
So,
you know,

611
00:38:44.020 --> 00:38:47.740
I think they,
they,
they got it somewhat working,
but with packets and everything,

612
00:38:47.741 --> 00:38:52.060
it would be like one character,
next character,
next character plotting of text.

613
00:38:52.060 --> 00:38:53.320
It was,
it was unusable.

614
00:38:53.890 --> 00:38:58.890
So do you have any theories on why some forward thinking things like potato

615
00:39:00.610 --> 00:39:04.660
never had much of an effect on an industry while others like as you mentioned,

616
00:39:04.661 --> 00:39:07.750
zero park had a lot of influence?
Um,

617
00:39:07.780 --> 00:39:10.100
well that's an interesting question because I'm,

618
00:39:10.120 --> 00:39:14.980
in fact a lot of the thinking on Plato did influence the industry and is still

619
00:39:14.981 --> 00:39:19.080
influencing an industry.
There are,
there are Plato folks,
uh,
that worked at the,

620
00:39:19.260 --> 00:39:22.780
at University of Illinois as student programmers and stuff that are,

621
00:39:22.810 --> 00:39:26.500
that are still working at Google.
Um,
I know one guys is one of the,

622
00:39:26.620 --> 00:39:30.730
I don't know if he's a director level or high level manager,
uh,

623
00:39:30.731 --> 00:39:33.790
working on the data centers and stuff like that and the build out of all that.

624
00:39:34.150 --> 00:39:37.300
Um,
so they're out there.
I mean,
uh,

625
00:39:37.301 --> 00:39:41.500
I just saw a guy yesterday down in Silicon Valley,
um,

626
00:39:41.530 --> 00:39:45.070
who worked at apple for like 20 years and you know,
uh,

627
00:39:45.110 --> 00:39:49.360
a whole bunch of people came out from Illinois and went to apple and the,

628
00:39:49.600 --> 00:39:52.150
you know,
first they did a tare,
then,

629
00:39:52.151 --> 00:39:55.210
then they moved to apple and they did their 20 years at apple,

630
00:39:55.211 --> 00:39:59.740
which when you think about it,
you know,
it must've been remarkable.
Um,
you know,

631
00:39:59.770 --> 00:40:04.210
Steve Then,
no,
Steve,
then Steve Back,
you know,
that kind of history.
Right.

632
00:40:04.600 --> 00:40:08.410
Um,
and uh,
but yeah,
there,
there are,

633
00:40:08.470 --> 00:40:13.470
there probably the most famous case of a technology that inspired something that

634
00:40:13.721 --> 00:40:18.721
became a multibillion dollar hit in the PC and internet world is lotus notes.

635
00:40:20.110 --> 00:40:23.140
Lotus notes is named after Plato notes.

636
00:40:23.440 --> 00:40:28.440
Plato nodes was written by a 17 year old kid named Dave wooly in 1973.

637
00:40:29.600 --> 00:40:30.250
Um,

638
00:40:30.250 --> 00:40:34.630
he was literally one of those kids at wandered in from across the street from

639
00:40:34.631 --> 00:40:39.610
his local high school.
And,
um,
you know,
they wouldn't go away.
They,

640
00:40:39.640 --> 00:40:44.150
they wouldn't be turned away.
They,
and he just was so curious about the system.

641
00:40:44.151 --> 00:40:46.000
He learned how to program.
And they said,
well,

642
00:40:46.001 --> 00:40:49.470
we really need some kind of conferencing or message board system.
You know,

643
00:40:49.630 --> 00:40:54.420
everything people need to be communicating 24,
seven asynchronously.

644
00:40:54.640 --> 00:40:57.120
Like I don't know how to solve this problem.
So,
and it's,

645
00:40:57.290 --> 00:41:01.090
it's two in the morning right now.
Maybe someone can answer this tomorrow,

646
00:41:01.330 --> 00:41:05.930
let me post a note somewhere.
And so he went off and wrote Plato notes and uh,

647
00:41:05.980 --> 00:41:08.350
shipped in it in August of two,

648
00:41:08.360 --> 00:41:13.360
the of 1973 and a completely transformed everything on Plato.

649
00:41:13.730 --> 00:41:18.490
It started the whole era of collaboration online with teams and everything.

650
00:41:18.491 --> 00:41:20.130
And then of course,
they realize,
well,

651
00:41:20.140 --> 00:41:22.510
we don't have to just talk about work subjects.

652
00:41:22.511 --> 00:41:27.430
We could also talk about sports and music and movies and politics and all the

653
00:41:27.431 --> 00:41:31.900
rest.
So sure enough,
all that stuff started to,
and uh,
you know,

654
00:41:31.930 --> 00:41:35.380
all hell broke loose when that all started.
And,
um,

655
00:41:35.900 --> 00:41:39.110
years later,
um,
well actually in the 80s,

656
00:41:39.170 --> 00:41:44.170
a when a couple of friends who had worked all as student programmers at the uni,

657
00:41:44.670 --> 00:41:46.280
uh,
they went off to,
uh,

658
00:41:46.640 --> 00:41:51.640
various companies and they decided to form a startup company in 1984 called iris

659
00:41:51.921 --> 00:41:56.720
associates.
And that's,
that was where Lotus notes came from.

660
00:41:56.721 --> 00:41:59.980
That's Ray Ozzie,
uh,
Tim Halverson and lend k.
Well,

661
00:41:59.981 --> 00:42:04.430
Lynn Lynn lives right here in town somewhere.
Um,
he has a little startup,

662
00:42:04.431 --> 00:42:06.710
I think right in Kirkland actually,
but,
um,

663
00:42:06.980 --> 00:42:11.660
so they went off and did that and they,
they had funding and support from Lotus,

664
00:42:11.690 --> 00:42:14.900
which was famous for one,
two,
three.
Um,

665
00:42:14.930 --> 00:42:18.590
but not forever because Microsoft came out with excel.

666
00:42:18.710 --> 00:42:22.190
Lotus needed something new.
They went with notes.

667
00:42:22.570 --> 00:42:26.680
They shipped it as a $64,000 products.
Um,

668
00:42:26.840 --> 00:42:31.160
and I think it was 1988 or 89.
It was a massive hit.

669
00:42:31.161 --> 00:42:35.600
And enterprises,
um,
it wound up having about 110 million users.

670
00:42:35.990 --> 00:42:40.480
It was sold.
Uh,
uh,
basically what's the last big product that load had?

671
00:42:40.520 --> 00:42:45.350
And Lotus was sold to IBM for about three and a half billion dollars in about

672
00:42:45.351 --> 00:42:47.780
95,
96 because of Lotus notes.

673
00:42:48.200 --> 00:42:51.590
And if you look at the feature set of Lotus notes,
you know,

674
00:42:51.680 --> 00:42:54.980
a lot of people would cringe day because we have open web and stuff,

675
00:42:55.010 --> 00:42:58.040
Google docs and stuff like that.
But they didn't have that back then.

676
00:42:58.041 --> 00:43:01.010
This was a stepping stone once again,

677
00:43:01.011 --> 00:43:04.550
a reaction to what had gone before.
You know,
they,

678
00:43:04.551 --> 00:43:07.970
they saw this great collaboration capability on Plato,

679
00:43:08.600 --> 00:43:13.600
but now that could we bring all that to a local area network environment in an

680
00:43:14.571 --> 00:43:17.150
enterprise.
And that's exactly what Lotus notes was.

681
00:43:17.450 --> 00:43:22.130
It had very many of the same features as had been on Plato that had been written

682
00:43:22.131 --> 00:43:26.120
by the kids back.
So a lot of technology made its way out.

683
00:43:26.270 --> 00:43:29.000
A lot of games did too.
Um,
you know,

684
00:43:29.001 --> 00:43:33.890
there were a bunch of Plato game authors that made the leap to apple to an IBM

685
00:43:33.891 --> 00:43:36.910
PC.
Um,
and uh,

686
00:43:37.040 --> 00:43:39.620
some of them became multimillionaires.
And in fact,

687
00:43:39.621 --> 00:43:44.621
I have a whole chapter on one guy with an incredible life story.

688
00:43:45.140 --> 00:43:50.030
Um,
I urge you to read it.
Uh,
this guy,
uh,
wrote,
uh,
one of the,

689
00:43:50.031 --> 00:43:54.080
probably the most beautiful game on Plato called Mahjong,
and it was the tile,

690
00:43:54.081 --> 00:43:57.620
the Chinese tile game,
a gorgeous graphics.

691
00:43:58.160 --> 00:44:03.160
And I interviewed him in 1997 and I had seen him online in the 80s when I was on

692
00:44:04.491 --> 00:44:07.340
Plato.
And I remembered he was very active in everything.

693
00:44:07.700 --> 00:44:12.650
And halfway during the interview,
um,
I asked him a question or whatever,

694
00:44:12.651 --> 00:44:17.360
and he mentioned,
oh,
by the way,
I'm in a wheelchair and I'm a quadriplegic.

695
00:44:17.750 --> 00:44:20.930
And I programmed Mahjong with a mouth stick.

696
00:44:21.500 --> 00:44:24.920
That's literally the only input he had.
And he had designed,

697
00:44:24.921 --> 00:44:29.870
I have a full of really probably the best photo color photo in the book is the

698
00:44:29.871 --> 00:44:34.290
screenshot of Mahjong.
It is staggering that he did that with a mouth stick.

699
00:44:34.620 --> 00:44:35.940
He wrote all the code.

700
00:44:36.210 --> 00:44:41.210
Then he bought a Macintosh in 1985 and he poured it all of the game to a,

701
00:44:43.410 --> 00:44:47.580
I guess see language environment on the Mac.
Uh,
all the graphics and everything.

702
00:44:47.610 --> 00:44:50.190
Again,
just using,
you know,
uh,

703
00:44:50.220 --> 00:44:55.220
input devices for disabled people and an absolute miracle.

704
00:44:55.500 --> 00:44:59.340
Um,
uh,
Activision licensed it,
published it,

705
00:44:59.341 --> 00:45:03.120
and they sold 10 million copies and he now lives in Hawaii.

706
00:45:03.180 --> 00:45:06.960
And I went out and visited him a couple of years ago and it was just absolutely

707
00:45:06.961 --> 00:45:10.750
remarkable.
He's doing great.
Um,
you know,
and,
uh,
he's had it,

708
00:45:10.770 --> 00:45:13.510
he's made a whole life or for himself.
Um,

709
00:45:14.010 --> 00:45:17.520
and he tells me it was all because of Plato.
Plato saved his life.
He had,

710
00:45:17.670 --> 00:45:19.430
he had a wrestling,
uh,
sorry,
uh,

711
00:45:19.470 --> 00:45:23.310
gymnastics at accident at Stanford when he was an Undergrad.

712
00:45:23.311 --> 00:45:28.311
He was on the Varsity gym team and he was in the gymnastics,

713
00:45:28.800 --> 00:45:33.800
a gymnasium and was in the middle of doing a flip or something in practice one

714
00:45:33.961 --> 00:45:38.820
day and landed in what was called the crash pit,
which is foam stuff.

715
00:45:38.821 --> 00:45:43.050
There just wasn't enough foam and he broke his neck and he should have died

716
00:45:43.051 --> 00:45:44.040
right on the spot.

717
00:45:44.400 --> 00:45:49.400
And there was a whole cascade of coincidences and miracles that happened,

718
00:45:50.630 --> 00:45:53.310
um,
that day and in subsequent days.

719
00:45:53.311 --> 00:45:55.740
And I'll urge you to read the chapter to find out more.

720
00:45:56.040 --> 00:45:57.240
So how's that for a teaser?

721
00:45:58.800 --> 00:46:00.410
<v 3>Thank you again for being here today.
Uh,</v>

722
00:46:00.420 --> 00:46:03.540
the topics of particular interest to me because I started college a year after

723
00:46:03.541 --> 00:46:07.870
you did and the second programming job I ever had was writing courseware

724
00:46:07.910 --> 00:46:08.743
unapplied us.

725
00:46:09.080 --> 00:46:13.360
<v 0>Cool.
Cool.
I was wondering if anybody here,
you know,
uh,</v>

726
00:46:13.730 --> 00:46:15.560
had been been there and done that,
you know.

727
00:46:16.060 --> 00:46:19.540
<v 3>Yeah.
I didn't do it for a long time,
but um,
I was wondering,
um,</v>

728
00:46:20.470 --> 00:46:23.740
if you could elaborate a bit more as you,
somebody asked about,
you know,

729
00:46:23.741 --> 00:46:24.610
what happened to it,

730
00:46:24.620 --> 00:46:29.170
you talked about how it's still lose on like an emulator or annex CD six now,

731
00:46:29.171 --> 00:46:31.810
but what from the,

732
00:46:31.840 --> 00:46:36.330
like I was working on it like 81,
82,
something like that.
Um,

733
00:46:36.580 --> 00:46:39.190
could you elaborate like what happened through the 80s and you just kind of die

734
00:46:39.191 --> 00:46:40.480
a slow death or,

735
00:46:40.760 --> 00:46:45.620
<v 0>um,
it was,
uh,
kind of similar to what happened to digital equipment corporation.</v>

736
00:46:45.930 --> 00:46:48.290
Um,
if you remember,
you know,
they made faxes,

737
00:46:48.291 --> 00:46:52.910
they were kind of important and a lot of people use them.
Now,

738
00:46:53.030 --> 00:46:55.990
you know,
deck is this ancient history thing.
Um,

739
00:46:56.000 --> 00:47:00.830
control data corporation was a major player in the computer industry and they

740
00:47:00.831 --> 00:47:04.700
were based in Minneapolis,
Bloomington area.
And,
um,

741
00:47:05.600 --> 00:47:10.460
uh,
you know,
their whole history was they sold mainframes,
they sold big iron,

742
00:47:10.790 --> 00:47:12.170
and that was their whole mindset.

743
00:47:12.171 --> 00:47:15.530
That was the whole salesforce was oriented to selling,
you know,

744
00:47:15.800 --> 00:47:20.510
getting a customer to write a check for like five,
$10 million per box,

745
00:47:20.540 --> 00:47:24.230
you know,
um,
they used to have a saying,
um,
you know,

746
00:47:24.260 --> 00:47:28.100
if you can plug it into the wall,
it's too small.
You know,

747
00:47:28.101 --> 00:47:33.101
you needed a dedicated channel from the electric company to power one of their

748
00:47:33.851 --> 00:47:38.600
things.
And,
um,
so,
you know,
Plato,
uh,

749
00:47:38.650 --> 00:47:40.810
for a while fit in that model.

750
00:47:40.811 --> 00:47:45.460
They could sell big mainframe systems with gazillions of terminals to go with
it.

751
00:47:45.670 --> 00:47:49.660
So universities,
and they did that all over the world.
Um,
there,
there,
there were,

752
00:47:49.661 --> 00:47:54.220
played out a system set up,
you know,
University of Alberta,
University of Quebec,

753
00:47:54.700 --> 00:47:55.810
probably,
you know,

754
00:47:55.960 --> 00:47:59.740
maybe a dozen or more in the United States at various universities like
Delaware,

755
00:48:00.220 --> 00:48:04.720
um,
uh,
uh,
all over the place.
And,
um,

756
00:48:04.930 --> 00:48:09.910
so they really tried really hard to commercialize it,
but their timing,

757
00:48:09.911 --> 00:48:13.570
once again,
you know,
timing is either good or bad and you know,

758
00:48:13.600 --> 00:48:18.010
in the era where the microcomputer is just raging and it's like a free,

759
00:48:18.011 --> 00:48:19.300
it's not only a freight train,

760
00:48:19.301 --> 00:48:23.890
it's a freight train carrying freight trains of the future at you.
Right.

761
00:48:24.250 --> 00:48:28.750
Um,
that was what was,
they were faced every single day.
So,

762
00:48:28.751 --> 00:48:29.560
you know,

763
00:48:29.560 --> 00:48:34.560
they might try to sell to university or to a gigantic school district and they'd

764
00:48:34.691 --> 00:48:35.530
say like,
you know,

765
00:48:35.531 --> 00:48:40.531
why should we spend $10 million on this system and then another maybe $10

766
00:48:40.840 --> 00:48:45.460
million on telecommunication costs thanks to mob bell at the time.
Um,
you know,

767
00:48:45.520 --> 00:48:46.210
uh,

768
00:48:46.210 --> 00:48:49.900
people didn't realize that the phone lines often we're more expensive than the

769
00:48:49.901 --> 00:48:53.950
hardware.
And I've already described how crazy expensive the hardware was.

770
00:48:54.160 --> 00:48:55.750
Phone lines were even worse than that,

771
00:48:55.960 --> 00:48:58.690
thousands per month and that kind of thing.
Um,

772
00:49:00.430 --> 00:49:04.720
why should we buy all that stuff when there's like this apple to that Apple's

773
00:49:04.750 --> 00:49:05.980
practically giving away.

774
00:49:06.280 --> 00:49:10.990
We could buy a whole room full of them and still afford chalk,
you know,

775
00:49:10.991 --> 00:49:15.580
for the classroom or whatever.
So it became a real problem.
And,

776
00:49:15.581 --> 00:49:17.560
and uh,
uh,

777
00:49:17.590 --> 00:49:21.760
so the company control data really struggled.
Um,

778
00:49:21.790 --> 00:49:25.540
meanwhile the University of Illinois there,
you know,
that was the home of Plato.

779
00:49:25.541 --> 00:49:29.590
That's where the lab was.
They were entrepreneurial too.

780
00:49:29.591 --> 00:49:31.780
And they decided,
you know,

781
00:49:31.960 --> 00:49:34.780
we're going to have to part ways with CDC and we're going to try to

782
00:49:34.781 --> 00:49:37.480
commercialize it ourselves.
We tried with CDC,

783
00:49:37.481 --> 00:49:41.140
it doesn't look like it's going to go and we still think we could do this.

784
00:49:41.200 --> 00:49:44.230
And um,
so,
uh,
Don Bitzer,

785
00:49:44.231 --> 00:49:48.850
who was the founder and the leader of the Plato Project,
had a vision still,

786
00:49:48.870 --> 00:49:52.030
you know,
in the early eighties that he could get hundreds of thousands,

787
00:49:52.031 --> 00:49:56.380
maybe millions of terminals connected all over the world on a network,
uh,

788
00:49:56.381 --> 00:49:59.620
of servers essentially.
I mean,

789
00:49:59.621 --> 00:50:03.400
what he was kind of envisioning was very similar to,
you know,

790
00:50:03.670 --> 00:50:07.960
what Google has or any major net company now with data centers all over the

791
00:50:07.961 --> 00:50:11.080
place,
you know,
fail safe,
redundant hardware.

792
00:50:11.330 --> 00:50:15.700
Any server goes down,
you know,
the user never even notices,

793
00:50:15.701 --> 00:50:17.650
it just flips to another server world.

794
00:50:17.670 --> 00:50:21.340
That data is still there and it's all instantaneous and everybody's happy.
Um,

795
00:50:21.341 --> 00:50:25.960
so they were thinking about those kinds of things even in the 80s.
And,
uh,

796
00:50:26.020 --> 00:50:29.930
so Illinois,
uh,
spun off another project called Nova Net,

797
00:50:30.290 --> 00:50:33.650
which was a commercial venture to commercialize Plato.

798
00:50:34.070 --> 00:50:37.490
And that actually did well.
That actually did commercially well.

799
00:50:37.820 --> 00:50:41.570
And it survived until just a couple of years ago.
In fact,

800
00:50:41.571 --> 00:50:46.571
the epilogue of the book is the final night when,

801
00:50:46.910 --> 00:50:49.730
when no vanette shuts down.
And,
and uh,

802
00:50:49.790 --> 00:50:54.790
I reluctantly stayed up late that night waiting for this thing to shut down.

803
00:50:54.801 --> 00:50:56.060
And of course,
you know,
the,

804
00:50:56.090 --> 00:50:59.030
whoever was supposed to shut it down at like two in the morning was the late.

805
00:50:59.570 --> 00:51:03.860
So there were like 22 people.
These die hard Plato folks,

806
00:51:04.320 --> 00:51:06.260
um,
hanging around,

807
00:51:06.290 --> 00:51:09.890
chatting in the notes files and in turn talking stuff for a couple of hours.

808
00:51:09.891 --> 00:51:13.940
Watch waiting just for the thing to shut down an issue.
The,
you know,

809
00:51:14.060 --> 00:51:17.570
Nova Net will be shutting down in 60 seconds.
Dot Dot.
Dot.
Nova Nova.

810
00:51:17.571 --> 00:51:21.080
We'll be shutting down in 30 seconds.
Dot.
Dot,
dot.
You know,
10 seconds then,

811
00:51:21.650 --> 00:51:26.210
you know,
Nova is gone.
And that was it.
It's,
it's,
it,
they've by,

812
00:51:26.250 --> 00:51:30.930
uh,
the early two thousands,
I believe it was,
um,

813
00:51:31.670 --> 00:51:35.420
Nova that had been acquired by a whole chain of companies,

814
00:51:35.750 --> 00:51:39.500
like one fish eating another fish,
bigger fish,
ate that fish.

815
00:51:39.830 --> 00:51:41.570
And it was now owned by Pearson,

816
00:51:41.660 --> 00:51:46.660
the gigantic global conglomerate that ironically had gobbled up a bunch of

817
00:51:47.841 --> 00:51:52.790
plaintiffs competitors from the,
from the eighties and nineties as well.
And,

818
00:51:52.791 --> 00:51:57.720
um,
but they had decided it was time to go web and use different technology and

819
00:51:57.770 --> 00:52:02.360
different product lines.
So Nova net was finally,
you know,
quietly shut down.

820
00:52:02.390 --> 00:52:07.370
But what's important to get back to your question is that,
um,
you know,
uh,

821
00:52:08.360 --> 00:52:11.350
no vanette found on a market and,

822
00:52:11.380 --> 00:52:15.380
and it wasn't one that was sexy or you know,

823
00:52:15.381 --> 00:52:20.210
cool and wasn't going to be written about and wired.
Um,
it was basically,
um,

824
00:52:20.600 --> 00:52:25.070
remedial education and,
um,
you know,
uh,
uh,

825
00:52:25.730 --> 00:52:29.180
the,
the last chance for high school kids for example,

826
00:52:29.181 --> 00:52:32.060
who are struggling and we're going to be kicked out of school permanently

827
00:52:32.270 --> 00:52:35.390
because they just didn't have the learning skills or they had learning

828
00:52:35.391 --> 00:52:40.250
difficulties.
Um,
one thing that was discovered early on Plato's that,

829
00:52:40.280 --> 00:52:41.113
um,

830
00:52:41.540 --> 00:52:45.870
students who have those kinds of difficulties do really well interacting with

831
00:52:45.871 --> 00:52:50.871
the computer because none of the social peer pressures of performing well in

832
00:52:50.961 --> 00:52:55.190
front of all these other kids in their class.
Um,
none of that existed.

833
00:52:55.220 --> 00:53:00.110
You could have a one on one interaction with the computer teacher and,

834
00:53:00.140 --> 00:53:04.640
um,
if you made a mistake and the screen said no try again,

835
00:53:04.910 --> 00:53:07.010
you wouldn't get laughed at in the classroom.

836
00:53:07.520 --> 00:53:12.520
And they also discovered that Plato at a gigantic market in prison education.

837
00:53:14.061 --> 00:53:15.410
So in,
uh,

838
00:53:15.740 --> 00:53:20.360
prisons all over the United States in the seventies and eighties,

839
00:53:20.810 --> 00:53:23.130
Plato was used to,
uh,
uh,

840
00:53:23.150 --> 00:53:28.150
provide GED training and things like that job training so that,

841
00:53:28.320 --> 00:53:28.681
you know,

842
00:53:28.681 --> 00:53:32.940
some inmate could get out and get a job and have skills and even get a degree.

843
00:53:33.300 --> 00:53:36.980
And it turned out to be incredibly successful.
And,
and that was one of the,

844
00:53:37.330 --> 00:53:41.260
the markets that really worked,
which was,
you know,
who knew,
you know.

845
00:53:42.120 --> 00:53:45.630
<v 1>All right.
So we're close to the end of the hour.
A couple of things there.</v>

846
00:53:45.631 --> 00:53:46.920
I think only two of us in the room,

847
00:53:46.921 --> 00:53:49.560
and I'm not one of them who have actually seen a news to Plato system,

848
00:53:49.561 --> 00:53:52.590
but that can be different Saturday,
uh,
because,
uh,

849
00:53:52.591 --> 00:53:55.500
at one o'clock at the living computer museum,
uh,

850
00:53:55.800 --> 00:53:57.990
Brian is going to go and he's going to give a talk about his book,

851
00:53:57.991 --> 00:54:00.300
and then they're going to have a two hour session after they're actually two

852
