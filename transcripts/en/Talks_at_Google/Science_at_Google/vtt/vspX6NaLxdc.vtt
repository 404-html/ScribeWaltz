WEBVTT

1
00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:11.380
Thank you very much everyone for coming along.

2
00:00:11.381 --> 00:00:15.760
It's a great pleasure to have the opportunity to talk to Google and it's a great

3
00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:19.720
opportunity to have a chance to,
to share some ideas and to get your feedback.

4
00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:23.470
So I'm going to attempt to encapsulate my talk fairly briefly.

5
00:00:23.471 --> 00:00:28.390
I will try to be concise enough that you have lots of,
uh,
lots of opportunity to,

6
00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:32.740
uh,
to,
to ask questions.
And also if you feel you want to object,
uh,

7
00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.530
you've sense of outrage halfway through and you want to reject as I'm going

8
00:00:35.531 --> 00:00:38.000
along,
that's absolutely fine.
Um,
it's the,
there,

9
00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.930
let's make it interactive and so the mind is flat.

10
00:00:40.931 --> 00:00:45.400
That sounds like a very radical claim and it is.
Uh,
but what is it,

11
00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:49.750
what is this claim?
And the,
the intuition will become clearer as we go along.

12
00:00:49.751 --> 00:00:53.450
But the thing I want to,
uh,
to,
to kick against is,

13
00:00:53.451 --> 00:00:56.140
is essentially in the subtitle,
the illusion of mental.

14
00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:00.790
That's so the idea I think a lot of us have is that there's this flow of

15
00:01:00.791 --> 00:01:01.624
thoughts,

16
00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:05.110
conscious experience that that your a and I'm experiencing now that you're

17
00:01:05.111 --> 00:01:06.010
experiencing now.

18
00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:11.290
And that is just one tiny flicker on the surface of a great stream or maybe a

19
00:01:11.291 --> 00:01:15.400
vast river of thoughts,
most of which are hidden mysteriously,

20
00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.470
but nonetheless flowing out to the sea.

21
00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:23.070
And this idea that what we consciously experience is just a tiny fraction of the

22
00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.630
all the other stuff that our brain is doing,

23
00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:30.580
which is also mysteriously a hidden thought is a very,
very powerful,

24
00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:33.640
a powerful intuition.
Now,
it's a recent intuition.

25
00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.990
So if you went back a hundred years or well,
that's 150 years preferred.

26
00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:39.790
Nobody really had this intuition.

27
00:01:39.791 --> 00:01:44.020
The idea then was the mind is that thing which you can experience to the idea

28
00:01:44.021 --> 00:01:46.660
that there could be thoughts that somehow you can't experience with CBE

29
00:01:46.661 --> 00:01:49.890
inherently a bit crazy.
But since,
uh,

30
00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:53.320
since Freud and indeed since I've,
we've understood the brain a lot better,

31
00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:55.660
it becomes much more natural to think,
well,
hang on,

32
00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:59.230
the brain's all doing all kinds of complicated things.
Um,

33
00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:00.740
perhaps my explain have,

34
00:02:00.741 --> 00:02:04.930
you can be explained by all sorts of mysterious machinery is mysterious mental

35
00:02:04.931 --> 00:02:07.780
activity that I'm not aware of now.

36
00:02:07.781 --> 00:02:10.930
I think of course the brain is doing lots of things and I'm not aware of but

37
00:02:10.931 --> 00:02:13.120
they're not faults.
There's something very special,

38
00:02:13.121 --> 00:02:17.050
very particular about the stream of thoughts which makes them very different

39
00:02:17.051 --> 00:02:19.540
from uh,
other things that our brains are doing.

40
00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.860
And I want to suggest to you that you're in your natural pre theoretic thought

41
00:02:23.861 --> 00:02:26.380
that no,
actually my mind is this flow,

42
00:02:26.381 --> 00:02:29.380
this stream of conscious experience that is in fact correct.

43
00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.870
Now if that's right and we will see a lot more cause he is,

44
00:02:33.871 --> 00:02:34.900
you'll see some reasons to believe this.

45
00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.090
It's not just a hazard of coming completely out of nowhere.

46
00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:38.920
I got go see some reasons why you might want to believe this.

47
00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:42.220
If it's right that in fact you can only think one thought at a time and that's

48
00:02:42.221 --> 00:02:45.070
the story one at once no more.

49
00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:50.970
Then we somehow seem to give a good impression that our thoughts are highly

50
00:02:52.481 --> 00:02:53.830
coherent and integrated.

51
00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.960
So it's not the case that I just spew out random sense design.

52
00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:00.730
Here's another one in,
here's another in a way that seems totally uncoordinated.

53
00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:04.360
It's almost as if there was a plan behind new sentences.

54
00:03:04.361 --> 00:03:08.440
It's almost as if underneath there's some sort of theory or sort of grand set of

55
00:03:08.441 --> 00:03:09.880
principles,
which I'm drawing on which,

56
00:03:09.881 --> 00:03:14.150
or from which these are these little individual snippets are issuing week.

57
00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:19.210
But what I think that is telling us is we're remarkably good improvisors there's

58
00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.891
not the case,
in fact,

59
00:03:20.891 --> 00:03:24.420
that there's a script inside me or a set of principles which generating the

60
00:03:24.421 --> 00:03:27.460
script,
which I'm just playing out.
In fact,

61
00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:32.660
I'm improvising now in telling you my thesis.
Just justice,

62
00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:35.800
your always improvising whenever you're having a conversation with anybody or

63
00:03:35.801 --> 00:03:40.120
doing any social interaction.
And yet of course we are very,

64
00:03:40.121 --> 00:03:44.050
very consummate,
very good.
Improvisors so my imagine for example,
the,

65
00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.210
the case of improvisational acting.

66
00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:51.630
You're told now play the role of somebody in their particular situation and

67
00:03:51.801 --> 00:03:55.940
picked her age.
So off you go and you start to think,
well,
yeah,

68
00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:59.020
I think to be saying this,
I seem to be saying that,
oh,
someone's responded.

69
00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:02.260
This is the kind of thing we all do in,
in,
in drama classes.

70
00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:05.800
There's a little interchange occurs.
A story might start to emerge.

71
00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:11.440
Obviously in that case we know that the story did not preexist the character

72
00:04:11.441 --> 00:04:13.360
we're now creating did not preexist either.

73
00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:18.040
The suggestion I have for you is that's what you're doing all the time.

74
00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:21.850
There's not the case that your different from your,

75
00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:25.810
when you're behaving normally to what you're doing when you're doing Improv,

76
00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:29.410
improvisational acting except the part you're playing as your own part

77
00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:33.360
still.
We'll leave those thoughts aside though.
Let's look at some,
uh,

78
00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:36.910
some examples and some illustrations and then we'll come back to the big
picture.

79
00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:39.460
Here is a funny illustration,

80
00:04:39.461 --> 00:04:42.010
which is fun irrespective of anything else I'm going to say,

81
00:04:42.011 --> 00:04:45.070
if you take nothing else away,
this is just a wonderful,
wonderful,

82
00:04:45.071 --> 00:04:47.740
strange illusion.
This is the 12 dot's illusion.

83
00:04:47.741 --> 00:04:52.690
This is invented by a French vision.
Scientists Jack knew and uh,

84
00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:55.630
you'll know they won't notice them.
Were $12 12,
like dots on the screen.

85
00:04:55.631 --> 00:04:57.610
Can you see the wall?
See,
they're all nice and clear.

86
00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:01.050
They're perfectly large enough to see.
I don't,

87
00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:03.310
if any of you are having trouble seeing all of them at once,

88
00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:06.370
say center come and go there.
They,
there's no trickery.

89
00:05:06.371 --> 00:05:09.790
This is the PowerPoint of the normal kind,
that dots,
uh,

90
00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:14.680
a role visible,
perfectly large enough to see if I don't agree it away.

91
00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:17.500
You'd see 12 dots plain as the nose on your face.

92
00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:21.400
And when I put that grade in that location,
if I move the grid to the side,

93
00:05:21.401 --> 00:05:24.850
the troph dots would pop out again.
Um,
if they're in that location though,

94
00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:29.800
strangely they keep popping in and out of existence.
So I find,
for example,

95
00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:34.690
I'm seeing a row of four,
oh no,
no.
Now a different row of,
for,
um,

96
00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:39.160
now I can see too.
Uh,
oh,
hang on.
Yet the Labasa modes appeared.

97
00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:41.410
It was just three for a minute,
and now a fourth one's appeared.

98
00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:46.570
It's all very odd.
What's going on?
Well,
the first thing that's going on is this.

99
00:05:46.571 --> 00:05:51.040
This should give you a sense of the constructive nature of perception.

100
00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:56.380
If you have a secret belief that your perceptual experience is just a reflection

101
00:05:56.381 --> 00:05:57.214
of the world,

102
00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:00.410
then this should make you doubt that because the world is stable here,

103
00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:03.620
but your perception is not stable.
Also,

104
00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:06.260
think about the chunks you're seeing.

105
00:06:06.261 --> 00:06:09.740
Sometimes you see just one dot sometimes to live.
Then there'll be a row.

106
00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:14.330
They're not just picking it,
popping up at random.
You're finding cohesive units.

107
00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:20.270
Things like rose,
things like pears,
things like single dots.
What?

108
00:06:20.271 --> 00:06:23.330
You're not finding his,
oh,
I saw one dot on the top right and Oh,

109
00:06:23.331 --> 00:06:24.740
another one at the bottom left.

110
00:06:24.741 --> 00:06:29.741
Now you don't see that these are organized and only one organization at once.

111
00:06:30.651 --> 00:06:34.530
So what you will not find is,
uh,
your set.
You're fine.

112
00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:36.590
You not find yourself thinking,
oh,

113
00:06:36.591 --> 00:06:41.390
I see a diagonal bar and a,

114
00:06:41.391 --> 00:06:45.500
and a horizontal bar at once.
You can't see that.
You see one bar,

115
00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:48.290
the other stuff is just gone.
You can't see anything else.

116
00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:51.620
But I'm not sure I can see a diagonal.
Oh,
hang halon.
I got,

117
00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:54.620
I got six and one's the,
I got a little um,
Domino's shape chunk.

118
00:06:54.621 --> 00:06:57.980
I don't know if you did.
And You keep looking,
you keep getting different stuff,

119
00:06:58.100 --> 00:06:59.540
but it's always organized.

120
00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:04.250
So what that's implying is that what your personal perception,

121
00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:09.350
your conscious experiences tracking is the organizations you were imposing on

122
00:07:09.351 --> 00:07:12.200
the world is not just the raw stimulus.
It's the organizations.

123
00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:18.470
And we can only impose one organization at once and the brain is continually

124
00:07:18.471 --> 00:07:21.980
fine looking for organizations,
grabbing them and then say,

125
00:07:21.981 --> 00:07:24.590
I've got that one now I throw it away.
Let me find a new one.

126
00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:26.360
I throw that one away.
I find a new one.

127
00:07:26.690 --> 00:07:31.690
If your brain is continually re processing the same material and reorganizing

128
00:07:32.091 --> 00:07:35.120
it.
So as I look at you now,
I'm doing the same thing,

129
00:07:35.121 --> 00:07:38.010
but it's not so obvious to me.
So I can't,
I,

130
00:07:38.011 --> 00:07:42.230
I have a sense of a sea of faces before me.
I have a sense that there are many,

131
00:07:42.231 --> 00:07:45.650
many people in your all visible,
in perfect detail,
in perfect color,

132
00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:47.870
but that can't be right can it?

133
00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:52.370
Because you all know from elementary school biology that I actually,

134
00:07:52.371 --> 00:07:55.070
almost all of your color vision is just in a tiny,

135
00:07:55.071 --> 00:07:59.180
tiny little window about this big.
As I looked through the world,

136
00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:01.400
that's where almost all the color is in the back of my retina.

137
00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:04.130
There's a little bit of color outside,
but not much.

138
00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:07.450
And in fact we know that because there are different cells for picking up color

139
00:08:07.451 --> 00:08:10.310
as I'm sure you will know.
Then there are four,
for example,

140
00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:13.460
detecting change in detecting just a black and white image,

141
00:08:13.461 --> 00:08:14.690
intensity differences and so on.

142
00:08:15.250 --> 00:08:20.240
So most of the color that you can see is in this little window and yet the world

143
00:08:20.241 --> 00:08:23.330
looks colorful also,
as you know perfectly well,

144
00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:26.810
you can only see detail on the fovea,
the,
this,

145
00:08:26.830 --> 00:08:30.320
this little area where you're looking.
Exactly.
So as I look around the world,

146
00:08:30.321 --> 00:08:34.850
through my little,
uh,
little done as it were,
telescope,
um,

147
00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:38.690
where I'm looking is it is in real detail,
but everywhere else isn't.

148
00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:43.370
But that's odd because I seem to see all of you in full color and in full detail

149
00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:44.990
all the time.
And that is an illusion.

150
00:08:45.530 --> 00:08:50.480
What's actually going on is very much what you see here is I'm finding one face.

151
00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:52.310
Then if I another face,
then another face,

152
00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:54.470
but I can't recognize two phases at once.

153
00:08:54.890 --> 00:08:57.730
And in fact there are lovely experiments,
which I'm not going to show you,

154
00:08:57.731 --> 00:08:59.570
but the relevant experiments where you,
um,

155
00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:02.690
you look at where someone's pointing their eye.
But we'll do it.

156
00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:04.860
We'll look at a case with reading in a minute,
not faces.

157
00:09:05.070 --> 00:09:08.610
You look at some where someone's pointing their eye in a crowd of faces and

158
00:09:08.611 --> 00:09:10.200
wherever they're looking,
there's a face,

159
00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:12.930
all the other faces or somehow scrambled.

160
00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:17.340
Just this just mean mashed up by some sort of image processing.

161
00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.950
You don't see anything strange.
You just think,
oh yeah,

162
00:09:20.070 --> 00:09:23.460
everyone's there perfectly as normal as you scan what might be a school

163
00:09:23.461 --> 00:09:27.360
photograph.
Everything is scrambled faces except the one you're looking at.

164
00:09:27.990 --> 00:09:30.660
That's fine.
You don't notice anything.
So I have the feeling,

165
00:09:30.661 --> 00:09:34.170
I'm seeing you all in perfect detail and I'm recognizing all these faces and I

166
00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:36.980
recognize it.
See the people who are looking interest in it,

167
00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:40.260
a little less skeptical,
but no,
that's not true at all.

168
00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:44.580
Here's something else which is giving you the sense,
strong sense.

169
00:09:44.581 --> 00:09:47.040
I think that the brain is much more cereal,

170
00:09:47.041 --> 00:09:49.530
much more one step at a time than you might think.

171
00:09:49.770 --> 00:09:53.300
You find one organization in the world,
you,
um,

172
00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:56.910
you impose it organization,
and then you move to the next one,

173
00:09:56.911 --> 00:09:59.700
then you move to the next one.
But you don't do them all at once.

174
00:09:59.820 --> 00:10:02.640
You have the sense that you could,
you're doing them all at once,

175
00:10:02.820 --> 00:10:03.720
but that's an illusion.

176
00:10:04.530 --> 00:10:09.530
So this is a lovely piece of experimental work done by two psychologists of

177
00:10:09.811 --> 00:10:14.070
attention.
Um,
crying and passionate.
They've done lots of great stuff from,

178
00:10:14.071 --> 00:10:15.180
this is just one example.

179
00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:20.280
That big thing is that you can only see one color at a time.

180
00:10:21.030 --> 00:10:24.330
Now you might think,
hang on.
That's just gotta be crazy.
I mean,
look,

181
00:10:24.331 --> 00:10:26.940
here are some grades.
I mean,
I can see more than one color.

182
00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:32.260
I can tell you I z look red and green and yellow and blue.
Conchae uh,

183
00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:34.950
what at first,
before we did the talking to talk through this little,

184
00:10:34.951 --> 00:10:38.580
I'm stimulus in the way they talked about it.
Just note the following.

185
00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:41.340
If I asked you how many colors are there on that screen?

186
00:10:42.630 --> 00:10:46.500
It's quite a hard question.
Four is the answer,
but you have to count.

187
00:10:46.770 --> 00:10:49.740
You don't just see say immediately,
oh yeah,

188
00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:51.990
for if I had four dots on the screen,

189
00:10:51.991 --> 00:10:56.070
you could straight away tell me four dots because you're able to process dots in

190
00:10:56.071 --> 00:11:00.600
parallel.
So four dots for elephants.
For Fish,

191
00:11:00.990 --> 00:11:05.070
you can say straight away,
four actually five you can't.
Five,
six,
seven.

192
00:11:05.071 --> 00:11:07.980
You do start to have to count.
But one,
two,
three or four.

193
00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:12.030
You can process them in parallel.
But colors are not like that.

194
00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:16.320
When you stay a collar,
you've got to think,
okay,
the blue got blue now red,

195
00:11:16.340 --> 00:11:19.920
oh yes.
Uh,
and now are yellow and you've got to count them one after the other.

196
00:11:20.090 --> 00:11:21.960
And it looks like according to their theory,

197
00:11:21.961 --> 00:11:25.950
what you're doing is when you're focusing on red,
yellow has gone,

198
00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:29.460
green has gone.
There's a general sense of colored stuff.

199
00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:31.350
Everything else is colored and varied,

200
00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:35.280
but the only actual color you're seeing is red or yellow or green.
Now,

201
00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:40.520
let me try and convince you that that a bit more persuasively by taking you

202
00:11:40.561 --> 00:11:45.270
through one of the demonstrations.
So here we have these little grids,

203
00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:50.500
and you'll notice that in this grade,
the s,

204
00:11:50.580 --> 00:11:53.290
the grids in fact matching,
they're the same grid.

205
00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:55.690
Notice how an obvious that is.

206
00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:59.680
That is really not obvious that you have to just go through and think,
Oh,

207
00:11:59.950 --> 00:12:03.340
two green squares,
two squares,
oh two green squares to red squares.

208
00:12:03.550 --> 00:12:06.880
You just have to go through step by step and check.

209
00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:12.130
Here's something neat.
Why don't you just think about the reds and check those?

210
00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:16.160
Oh,
you can do that,
can't you?
You can suddenly see,
oh,
we have reds,

211
00:12:16.210 --> 00:12:20.110
this funny shape here.
Look,
there it is.
Yeah,
the reds are the same.
Okay,

212
00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:22.450
and now what about the eyes?
Oh yeah,
the yellows are the same.

213
00:12:22.630 --> 00:12:23.650
And what about the blues?
Oh yeah,

214
00:12:23.651 --> 00:12:26.170
the blues are the same because every time I give you a color,

215
00:12:26.171 --> 00:12:29.980
you can suddenly see a pattern in that color and you can compare.

216
00:12:29.981 --> 00:12:31.930
You can see that pan all at once.
You can see all the green,

217
00:12:32.170 --> 00:12:33.010
you can see all the arrows,

218
00:12:33.011 --> 00:12:35.620
you can see all the blues and you can see they are the same,

219
00:12:36.460 --> 00:12:40.740
but you can't see more than one color.
So if I say,
okay,
what's the,

220
00:12:40.770 --> 00:12:44.320
what shape is created by the Greens?
Easy.

221
00:12:45.250 --> 00:12:49.570
The Greens of this shape,
the yellows are that shape.
But if I say,
oh,

222
00:12:49.571 --> 00:12:54.160
just what shape would be created by the Greens and yellows put together,

223
00:12:54.850 --> 00:12:59.140
no idea possible
one color at a time.

224
00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:03.580
So he,
so the thought here is that when you get to people to do this task,

225
00:13:03.940 --> 00:13:08.940
the best way to do it and the only way they can do it quickly is just to look at

226
00:13:09.191 --> 00:13:13.570
each color,
one after the other.
Similarly with symmetry,
same trick of course.

227
00:13:13.660 --> 00:13:17.650
Similarly with men can rotation.
So let's just do symmetry.
So here we're saying,

228
00:13:17.651 --> 00:13:20.890
oh,
these two things the same.
You can't process color in parallel,

229
00:13:20.891 --> 00:13:23.380
so you don't know.
But what you can do is think,
well,

230
00:13:23.381 --> 00:13:25.330
the yellows are the same and the blues are the same.
And,

231
00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:29.110
and doing it as I say it and say it and the red yet that'll say,
Oh yes,

232
00:13:29.111 --> 00:13:32.710
the Greens are the same or they've had merit mirrors,
I can do that,

233
00:13:33.220 --> 00:13:37.420
but I can't do them all at once.
So

234
00:13:39.130 --> 00:13:41.060
let's have another look at something.
Uh,

235
00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:44.200
back to back to something we were talking about a moment ago.

236
00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:48.880
I mentioned that,
um,
this is going back to the seriality your vision,

237
00:13:49.450 --> 00:13:50.410
not color anymore.

238
00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:54.070
I mentioned that you can have an experiment where we look at say a school

239
00:13:54.071 --> 00:13:57.190
photograph and we mash all the phases except the one you're looking at.

240
00:13:57.370 --> 00:13:58.720
And you notice nothing unusual.

241
00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:01.930
This is the original demonstration of that type of phenomenon,

242
00:14:01.931 --> 00:14:05.080
which was done actually in the mid seventies by Keith Rainer,

243
00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:07.330
very famous psychologist of reading.

244
00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:10.750
And this is an experiment became possible because it was,

245
00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:13.420
it became possible to track people's eyes and create,

246
00:14:13.421 --> 00:14:17.410
change the computer display instantly as they are quite instantly,

247
00:14:17.411 --> 00:14:20.620
but instantly enough as they move their eyes across the screen.

248
00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:23.870
So this is the v the reading version of um,

249
00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:27.580
a fun experiment I mentioned with faces.
So what we have is a sentence,

250
00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:32.590
which in this case is,
it's remarkable how little we actually see at any instant,

251
00:14:32.620 --> 00:14:33.453
even though,

252
00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:37.810
and here's your eye and when they are your eyes,

253
00:14:37.811 --> 00:14:42.260
here we create,
create a little window of 15 letters,
10,

254
00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:46.600
10,
roughly,
um,
to the right five to the left.

255
00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:49.300
If you're reading a language like Hebrew,
which goes the other way,

256
00:14:49.301 --> 00:14:51.680
then you'd have the,
uh,
you,

257
00:14:51.681 --> 00:14:56.090
you'd have the window larger in the other direction towards the left because the

258
00:14:56.091 --> 00:14:58.970
brain is slightly more interested in previewing and looking backwards.

259
00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:03.770
So what you do is you just change all the other letters,
two axes,

260
00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.730
and you just allow a little window of lucidity here.

261
00:15:08.300 --> 00:15:10.310
Now as soon as you move your eyes to here,

262
00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:12.350
suddenly the window of lucidity has moved.

263
00:15:12.590 --> 00:15:14.420
And again and again and again and again.

264
00:15:14.810 --> 00:15:18.020
And you can read the sentence quite happily.
You don't realize anything funny.

265
00:15:18.290 --> 00:15:21.050
If you look over the shoulder of the person reading the sentence,
you think,

266
00:15:21.230 --> 00:15:23.690
what's going on?
There's x is everywhere.
Why don't they see it?

267
00:15:24.170 --> 00:15:27.560
But of course they don't see it because exactly where they're looking.

268
00:15:27.940 --> 00:15:32.330
There were proper letters.
It's a very,
very strange,
very,

269
00:15:32.331 --> 00:15:34.250
very strange illusion to be inside.

270
00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:37.040
Another thing you might be interested in as you might think,
yeah,

271
00:15:37.041 --> 00:15:39.320
but Paul is going on when you're moving your eyes.
I mean,

272
00:15:39.321 --> 00:15:43.320
all of these letters are changing and they're changing from letters to exes and

273
00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:47.080
back.
It's a bit odd.
Why didn't I notice that when I moved my eye?
I will ask,

274
00:15:47.081 --> 00:15:50.540
because when you're moving your eye,
you're blind.
You simply can't see anything.

275
00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:52.100
Um,
it's really,
again,

276
00:15:52.101 --> 00:15:56.240
the consciousness falls as completely as I look around the room.
I think,
oh no,

277
00:15:56.510 --> 00:16:00.950
it's all a smooth,
continuous,
continuous perception.
Now I see this.

278
00:16:00.951 --> 00:16:04.160
Now I see that it's flowing effortlessly from one thing to the next.

279
00:16:04.161 --> 00:16:08.390
It's not just to Carto,
but in fact I'm seeing a scrap of information,

280
00:16:08.630 --> 00:16:11.150
then blindness,
then scrapping information,

281
00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:13.100
then blind miss another scrap of information.

282
00:16:13.310 --> 00:16:17.810
And I'm putting all these together to,
to give an extensive of a rich,

283
00:16:17.811 --> 00:16:19.910
continuous conscious experience.
But it's an illusion.

284
00:16:22.490 --> 00:16:27.490
Now I want to switch gears slightly to think about a different way in which,

285
00:16:28.430 --> 00:16:33.150
uh,
our thoughts,
our work very differently from the way we imagine.

286
00:16:33.950 --> 00:16:37.220
So we improvise our way to create a niqab,
the visual world.

287
00:16:37.940 --> 00:16:38.960
We scrambled the other,

288
00:16:38.961 --> 00:16:42.710
a sense of the richness of the vision through these tiny snippets.
And we,

289
00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:45.170
the illusion is so convincing me we think it's real.

290
00:16:46.430 --> 00:16:49.040
But let's now look at something more abstract.

291
00:16:49.060 --> 00:16:51.500
Let's look at a of of emotion.

292
00:16:52.190 --> 00:16:55.410
So here is a famous example by lev cooler chauffeur,

293
00:16:55.420 --> 00:16:59.000
a Russian film director known as the coolest off effect,
much,
um,

294
00:16:59.060 --> 00:17:03.470
talked about by Alfred Hitchcock and very well known in,
in the cinema world.

295
00:17:04.010 --> 00:17:07.420
So this is done with stills,
but in fact it's better done with,
uh,

296
00:17:07.430 --> 00:17:11.730
with moving pictures.
So here is,
um,
I think it's Isaac,
Missouri Kean who's uh,
uh,

297
00:17:11.840 --> 00:17:13.640
one of 'em Cuellar shots.
The actors,

298
00:17:13.641 --> 00:17:17.060
this is going back to the early days of cinema in Russia.

299
00:17:17.990 --> 00:17:22.610
And here he is paired with a,
a,
a sad scene at a,

300
00:17:22.630 --> 00:17:27.410
a child lying in a coffin.
And if you look at this on,
on its own is power.

301
00:17:27.620 --> 00:17:31.580
You think he's looking in a very subtle and kind of a nuanced way,

302
00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:35.390
looking utterly grief stricken.
On the other hand,

303
00:17:35.510 --> 00:17:39.350
if you put in an extra bowl of soup,
he starts to look hungry.
Uh,

304
00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:41.750
and so of course you don't see the effect quite as strongly here because I put

305
00:17:41.751 --> 00:17:45.320
them all together.
Um,
but if you block out the others and just focused on this,

306
00:17:45.321 --> 00:17:47.300
you'll find he's now looking,
he's looking,

307
00:17:47.301 --> 00:17:50.630
kind of interested in this suit cause he's slightly hungry,
but it's very subtle.

308
00:17:50.631 --> 00:17:52.200
Act Two,
he's very,
very,
very,

309
00:17:52.201 --> 00:17:56.280
very understated and Harry is looking somewhat lustful as he looks at this,

310
00:17:56.281 --> 00:17:59.970
this young woman here.
So now you see again,
he's at such a marvelous,

311
00:17:59.971 --> 00:18:02.770
marvelous actor because of his incredible understatement.
Um,

312
00:18:02.790 --> 00:18:07.380
but of course you will have guessed this is the same picture and indeed I think

313
00:18:07.381 --> 00:18:12.000
this is the acute or chefs great insight is that when we're interpreting a face,

314
00:18:12.390 --> 00:18:16.020
we interpreter a lot of the emotion in that face based on the context.

315
00:18:16.950 --> 00:18:18.300
So in fact,
a lot of the secrets,

316
00:18:18.310 --> 00:18:22.410
it at least I think in his view of good acting is not to not to be too

317
00:18:22.411 --> 00:18:27.411
expressive because you want the viewer to impose the appropriate meaning onto

318
00:18:27.721 --> 00:18:30.330
your face.
And if you were to express,
if they can't do that,

319
00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:32.640
you're kind of forcing me or forcing the issue.

320
00:18:34.590 --> 00:18:37.530
But that's interesting because this gives them,
again,
another illusion.

321
00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:41.460
You think when you look around the world that faces,
you think the,

322
00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:43.170
all the activities in the face,

323
00:18:43.530 --> 00:18:48.530
the face just has the look of lawfulness or hunger or our sadness.

324
00:18:49.170 --> 00:18:51.870
But in fact your imposing that you're imposing that because of your wider

325
00:18:51.871 --> 00:18:56.390
understanding of the,
of the situation.
So we're improvising,
not just our,
um,

326
00:18:56.730 --> 00:19:00.510
constructing the world from snippets in a way that fools us.

327
00:19:00.750 --> 00:19:05.190
We're also imposing meaning on snippets here,
faces in a way that forms us.

328
00:19:05.191 --> 00:19:07.650
We think that the meaning is in the face,

329
00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:10.500
but in fact the mania is being imposed from outside.

330
00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:13.560
Here's another similar example.

331
00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:16.860
This is a US senator running for election.

332
00:19:17.100 --> 00:19:21.900
Now if you take this face here and blow it up and cut out everybody else,

333
00:19:22.140 --> 00:19:25.860
this payload looks really very angry.
He does not look happy.

334
00:19:26.460 --> 00:19:31.360
On the other hand,
this is a web.
Jim Webb is Maleah.
Uh,

335
00:19:31.380 --> 00:19:35.610
in the actual election rally,
he's looking triumphant.
Now how odd,

336
00:19:35.910 --> 00:19:40.260
this is the same picture,
but in the context you realize,
yeah,

337
00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:45.450
look off triumphal triumphant delight.
Victory is going to be hours,

338
00:19:45.750 --> 00:19:50.750
whereas here is looking extremely unhappy indeed and frustrated things are

339
00:19:50.761 --> 00:19:51.594
desperate.

340
00:19:52.980 --> 00:19:57.060
Now that's interesting because that's a,

341
00:19:57.061 --> 00:20:02.061
that same insight applies to our interpretation of our own emotions.

342
00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:06.780
So you might think,
well,
if I'm looking at somebody else,

343
00:20:06.900 --> 00:20:10.050
maybe that face is a bit of a cipher and maybe I do have to use other

344
00:20:10.051 --> 00:20:13.680
information to quite work out whether they're angry or they're delighted or

345
00:20:13.681 --> 00:20:17.460
whatever it may be.
Maybe the,
I have to impose extra information,

346
00:20:17.580 --> 00:20:21.690
but of course for myself,
I just know what I'm thinking don't die.

347
00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:26.340
And I think that's a really fundamental illusion because actually this

348
00:20:26.341 --> 00:20:30.000
physiological signals we get from our own bodies are extremely sparse.

349
00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:34.590
And roughly speaking,
and this is two,
two crew.
But not much to crude.

350
00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:36.750
Roughly speaking,
we have two types of signal.

351
00:20:36.751 --> 00:20:40.960
One is saying what's my arousal level?
So saying you know,

352
00:20:41.100 --> 00:20:45.900
I'm really sleepy and bored or I'm kind of excited and the other one is saying

353
00:20:45.990 --> 00:20:50.990
I'm interested and want to approach and engage with this object or personal

354
00:20:51.611 --> 00:20:55.240
thing or of the opposite.
I want to remove myself.

355
00:20:56.050 --> 00:20:59.200
But that's about it,
right?
That's about all you have to go on.

356
00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:02.530
So then you have to take that very minimal physiological signal,

357
00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:07.030
which is like a very,
very uh,
unexpressed your face,
but an internal one.

358
00:21:07.450 --> 00:21:11.710
And you have to think what's going on in the world.
And the,
Oh,
I guess this,

359
00:21:11.711 --> 00:21:15.670
this physiological signal must be telling me I'm angry or it must be telling me

360
00:21:15.671 --> 00:21:17.800
I'm immune to,
it must be telling me something else.

361
00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:22.340
So for physiologically your own physiology is like a really,
really unexpressed,

362
00:21:22.341 --> 00:21:27.341
your face is like the what the example it left cuter shelf gives and to actually

363
00:21:28.211 --> 00:21:30.640
make sense of your own emotions you have to interpret.

364
00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:33.880
So there are lots of lovely experiments are not going to talk about them now,

365
00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:39.000
but there are lots of love to experiments where you can show that people in the

366
00:21:39.041 --> 00:21:44.041
very same physiological state will interpret that state as anger or um,

367
00:21:44.350 --> 00:21:48.160
delight or amusement just based on contextual shifts.

368
00:21:48.910 --> 00:21:52.930
So the idea that the emotions well up from within you is really an illusion.

369
00:21:53.710 --> 00:21:54.371
In fact,

370
00:21:54.371 --> 00:21:59.371
you've got a very thin signal and you're interpreting what an earth must I be

371
00:21:59.531 --> 00:22:02.680
feeling now?
Oh,
I bet it's this telling a story,

372
00:22:02.860 --> 00:22:05.740
improvising your own own emotional thoughts.

373
00:22:06.550 --> 00:22:10.600
Let me give you an example of the improvised nature of choice.

374
00:22:10.601 --> 00:22:15.040
Now this is the famous experiment done by laws hall and Patio Hanson.

375
00:22:15.041 --> 00:22:16.720
So Petta was a postdoc of mine years ago,

376
00:22:16.900 --> 00:22:20.710
but did this experiment before he ever joined my lab and have I have no,

377
00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:24.550
I can take no credit for it,
sadly.
I wish I could.
It's very clever experiment.

378
00:22:25.090 --> 00:22:26.590
So the experiment works like this.

379
00:22:27.190 --> 00:22:30.460
You give people two options and if the task can be anything,

380
00:22:30.461 --> 00:22:34.360
but the most famous original task is which of these faces do you prefer?

381
00:22:34.390 --> 00:22:36.430
So it's done with faces,
but it doesn't,
it doesn't have to be,

382
00:22:37.030 --> 00:22:40.210
I might say about a bit about some of the other options in a moment.

383
00:22:40.810 --> 00:22:44.140
So we sent you say to somebody,
which of these spaces do you prefer?
And they say,

384
00:22:44.141 --> 00:22:46.030
Oh,
I know,
yeah,
it's kind of difficult,

385
00:22:46.031 --> 00:22:50.020
but maybe I sort of slightly prefer that one.
So that's,
that's a slow phase.

386
00:22:50.110 --> 00:22:52.900
So this is step one,
look at his faces.
Step two,

387
00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:57.070
that's my favorite step three.
Oh well have a closer look at that one then.

388
00:22:57.430 --> 00:23:01.360
But step four,
Craig,
I'm given you the wrong one.
Okay.

389
00:23:01.830 --> 00:23:06.040
Did you do this task a lot?
And you only do a trick occasionally.
So in fact,

390
00:23:06.041 --> 00:23:10.120
I subsidy like 32 trials with three tricks.
And if you're wondering,
oh,

391
00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:13.360
I want to do they notice the trick a,
when you asked them,

392
00:23:13.361 --> 00:23:17.120
they don't seem to have noticed the trick,
but be much more cleverly.
Um,

393
00:23:17.660 --> 00:23:21.130
Petta asked People Petron Lars ask people,
uh,

394
00:23:21.190 --> 00:23:24.890
well they say in,
in experiment we just did,
um,

395
00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:26.590
half the half the subjects.

396
00:23:26.620 --> 00:23:29.230
We did some tricks on them and for half we didn't know tricks.

397
00:23:29.470 --> 00:23:32.740
Which one were you?
So this gives them the chance to say,
wow,

398
00:23:32.741 --> 00:23:36.250
I did feel a bit funny about some of them.
I bet you tricked me.
But they don't.

399
00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:40.330
Most people data where about 80% of people don't think there've been trached 20%

400
00:23:40.331 --> 00:23:42.870
deet.
So what's,

401
00:23:42.980 --> 00:23:46.850
what's interesting about the people who've been tricked is that they are now

402
00:23:46.851 --> 00:23:50.930
asked to explain their choice and they do very happily,

403
00:23:51.290 --> 00:23:53.630
they will give an explanation for the thing they did not choose.

404
00:23:53.631 --> 00:23:57.260
And it's a perfectly lucid explanation is just as long as just a fluid is just

405
00:23:57.261 --> 00:24:00.100
like all the other explanations they give.
But it can't be the right,

406
00:24:00.101 --> 00:24:02.450
it can't be anything other than a rationalization.

407
00:24:02.451 --> 00:24:07.310
They can't be doing anything other than improvising because it's the wrong
thing.

408
00:24:08.150 --> 00:24:10.580
So the thought here is that you're an improviser,

409
00:24:10.820 --> 00:24:14.570
you're improvising the visual world,
you're improvising facial expressions,

410
00:24:14.810 --> 00:24:17.990
you're improvising explanations for your choices,
you're rationalizing,

411
00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:20.660
we all sorts of aware that we do a bit of rationalization.

412
00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:24.020
The illusion is thinking.
Yeah,
but sometimes I don't.

413
00:24:24.350 --> 00:24:28.670
Sometimes I just look deep inside to do the actual causes of my own thoughts and

414
00:24:28.671 --> 00:24:31.760
think,
ah,
I know what I really was doing now because I've gone back into,

415
00:24:31.761 --> 00:24:35.810
as it were,
into my own mental history and picked out the real reasons.

416
00:24:35.930 --> 00:24:39.530
But you can't do that.
All you've got is this flow of experience.

417
00:24:39.531 --> 00:24:43.310
All you've got is the sensory experience of the world.

418
00:24:43.311 --> 00:24:47.710
And you've got your own voice and your own sub vocalizations that will

419
00:24:47.810 --> 00:24:50.240
linguistic stuff flowing through your mind.

420
00:24:50.390 --> 00:24:54.080
And you've got some physiological signals that it's,
it you have not got access.

421
00:24:54.081 --> 00:24:56.480
You want to know,
cause I'm privileged key into your own memory.

422
00:24:58.610 --> 00:25:02.870
Here's a lovely experiment,
um,
from 1974 of the ancient experiment,

423
00:25:02.930 --> 00:25:07.010
but a very nice one.
There are many more sense,
but this is the classic,
um,

424
00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:11.540
which gives you a sense of how powerful these effects are.
So this is uh,

425
00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:14.660
an experiment we started with was done on the um,

426
00:25:14.780 --> 00:25:18.560
the campus of the University of British Columbia and on that campus apparently,

427
00:25:18.770 --> 00:25:20.000
and not being on the being to this,

428
00:25:20.001 --> 00:25:22.460
but apparently there was a very high and wobbly bridge like this one.

429
00:25:23.270 --> 00:25:25.370
There's also a low non wobbly bridge.

430
00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:30.260
What you do to in this experiment is you station experiments as attractive

431
00:25:30.261 --> 00:25:35.261
female experimenters at one end of the two bridges may bridge crosses cross now

432
00:25:37.450 --> 00:25:42.300
that interviewed on some fairly pointless questionnaire survey type of study,
uh,

433
00:25:42.350 --> 00:25:47.090
by the,
by the female experiments as then the experimenter says,

434
00:25:47.180 --> 00:25:50.990
oh,
of radical reasons.
If there are any issues raised by this survey,

435
00:25:50.991 --> 00:25:53.060
which there certainly won't be,
um,
you,

436
00:25:53.070 --> 00:25:55.520
you can contact me if you have any problems.
Here's my phone number.

437
00:25:56.450 --> 00:25:57.231
The question is,

438
00:25:57.231 --> 00:26:02.231
does the do the bridge crosses call now the first thing is yes,

439
00:26:02.421 --> 00:26:03.950
they suspiciously do call quite a lot,

440
00:26:03.951 --> 00:26:07.040
which is a bit weird because there's just no issues raised by this survey.

441
00:26:07.490 --> 00:26:09.920
But excitingly,
and this was the prediction,

442
00:26:10.340 --> 00:26:14.390
the bridge crosses who've gone over the High Wobbly Bridge Corp about twice as

443
00:26:14.391 --> 00:26:17.660
often.
Now.
Why is that?
Why is that?

444
00:26:17.661 --> 00:26:22.150
Why is it that a day later or two days later,
they pluck up the courage ne?

445
00:26:22.310 --> 00:26:27.020
They phoned that,
that experiment with some on some pretext.

446
00:26:27.230 --> 00:26:30.860
Why are they doing that?
Just because they walked across a Highbridge bridge.

447
00:26:31.020 --> 00:26:31.690
While the the,

448
00:26:31.690 --> 00:26:35.300
the answer is at least this is the prediction and the explanation in the study.

449
00:26:35.660 --> 00:26:38.690
The answer is when you've just walked across a Highbridge,

450
00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:41.600
you're really full of adrenaline is kind of a scary experience.

451
00:26:42.710 --> 00:26:46.710
Then you meet someone and you're full of adrenaline.
You think,
wow,
you know why?

452
00:26:46.750 --> 00:26:49.590
What's with the adrenaline?
Well,
obviously this person must be just like,

453
00:26:49.591 --> 00:26:53.870
fantastic.
I must say it's totally,
totally did I just totally,
for me,
they did.

454
00:26:54.120 --> 00:26:55.890
There's just this amazing sense of chemistry.

455
00:26:56.040 --> 00:26:58.650
What there is is a huge mass of adrenaline flowing around,

456
00:26:58.651 --> 00:27:02.820
but that's just cause your water costs are being the high bridge.
You,
however,

457
00:27:02.850 --> 00:27:06.060
make the,
the,
as,
as the psychologist called the attribution error,

458
00:27:06.270 --> 00:27:09.810
you don't realize,
oh,
it's the bridges and that of course you think,

459
00:27:09.811 --> 00:27:14.040
well it must be the person and therefore you form this belief that they're

460
00:27:14.041 --> 00:27:16.770
somehow very,
very attractive to you and you really must give them a call.

461
00:27:18.220 --> 00:27:21.060
And I know that as you say,
there are many,
many such such experiments.

462
00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:26.100
But the thought there again is that we have this idea that we have mental dapps

463
00:27:26.101 --> 00:27:29.910
from which things kind of mysteriously appear.
So if you think,
oh,
well,

464
00:27:29.911 --> 00:27:33.540
who am I trying to do?
Well,
as I tried,
I said,
very hard question.
That is,
it's,

465
00:27:33.541 --> 00:27:33.990
you know,

466
00:27:33.990 --> 00:27:37.350
there's all kinds of deep subterranean forces determining this and they just,

467
00:27:37.470 --> 00:27:40.370
but as far as mysteriously,
um,
I just,
you know,

468
00:27:40.380 --> 00:27:43.070
have these strong stable preferences.
They just come from nowhere.

469
00:27:43.071 --> 00:27:44.190
I don't know what they are,
where they come from,

470
00:27:44.430 --> 00:27:47.650
but actually that's a bit of an illusion.
In fact,
a,

471
00:27:47.700 --> 00:27:50.790
you're trying to interpret your own experience as you're going through the
world.

472
00:27:51.280 --> 00:27:54.990
If we tranq you just thought that experience,
then you interpret it wrongly.

473
00:27:57.300 --> 00:28:01.920
Okay.
Now,
why are people not feeble,

474
00:28:02.180 --> 00:28:04.680
um,
highly unstable creatures,

475
00:28:04.681 --> 00:28:09.060
just flitting from one random improvise thoughts for the next,

476
00:28:09.061 --> 00:28:12.090
why are we able to be so high,
highly integrated,

477
00:28:12.091 --> 00:28:16.080
stable characters who are able to lead sort of organized lives?

478
00:28:16.950 --> 00:28:20.310
Well the answer I wanted to give to that is that you should think of your mind

479
00:28:20.311 --> 00:28:23.610
is a bit like a tradition.
So the,
the,

480
00:28:23.620 --> 00:28:26.100
the thought here is that you can only think one thought at a time,

481
00:28:26.280 --> 00:28:30.000
but every thought is shaping the next door and is shaped by the previous
thought.

482
00:28:31.080 --> 00:28:34.260
So you're a bit like a drop of water running down a landscape.

483
00:28:35.130 --> 00:28:37.620
The way that drop of water falls when it rains,

484
00:28:37.621 --> 00:28:41.490
where those droplets fall is determined and when and where they flow is

485
00:28:41.491 --> 00:28:43.980
determined by the landscape that is already there.

486
00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:48.060
But that landscape is itself created by all those previous droplets.

487
00:28:48.570 --> 00:28:49.850
And of course each new droplet.

488
00:28:49.860 --> 00:28:54.860
It just makes a tiny change to the landscape and will therefore affect future

489
00:28:54.871 --> 00:28:57.420
droplets.
So you're a liker,
uh,

490
00:28:57.460 --> 00:29:01.560
you're sort of like landscape created by sort of endless flow of a flow of
water.

491
00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:06.690
Whereas what there isn't in the landscape is a sculptor.
You might think.
Yeah,

492
00:29:06.700 --> 00:29:07.411
but I mean,
you know,

493
00:29:07.411 --> 00:29:10.790
how do these Haniya how do these rocks have such interesting shapes or how,

494
00:29:10.791 --> 00:29:12.240
how has it,
how come the shape to so,

495
00:29:12.450 --> 00:29:16.410
so stable or how come the different kinds of hills have ourselves similar?
Look,

496
00:29:17.220 --> 00:29:21.570
the answer is not that they were created or designed or hair.
There's any,
uh,

497
00:29:21.710 --> 00:29:26.640
as any agency behind them.
They are the process of a long period of one.

498
00:29:26.700 --> 00:29:27.810
Each force,

499
00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:31.620
each little tiny change changing the next change in the next change in the next.

500
00:29:31.621 --> 00:29:34.800
And I think our minds are very similar now and not,

501
00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:38.760
but I also want to give you the sense that the way in which we are change

502
00:29:38.780 --> 00:29:42.460
changed by our experience is incredibly and creative.
So,

503
00:29:42.461 --> 00:29:44.890
so far you might think this is a bit of a negative story.

504
00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:47.020
I thought I could see this whole world.

505
00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:49.660
I thought I could interpret people's faces.
I thought I understood where my,

506
00:29:49.661 --> 00:29:52.300
where my feelings are coming from.
And you're telling me,
I don't,

507
00:29:52.540 --> 00:29:55.600
this sounds while the bad,
but it actually,
I think it's sort of the opposite.

508
00:29:56.110 --> 00:29:59.890
I think in reality we were astonishingly powerful creative machines.

509
00:30:00.370 --> 00:30:02.380
We're able to make sense of the world around us.

510
00:30:02.381 --> 00:30:05.290
We were able to make sense of his facial expressions,
um,

511
00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:10.120
experiences in a way that is extraordinarily labor creative,

512
00:30:10.150 --> 00:30:13.720
inventive.
So I want to give you just a hint of that and cause the,

513
00:30:13.721 --> 00:30:15.370
and then of course we create traditions.

514
00:30:15.510 --> 00:30:18.800
Those traditions are not as some sort of blind copying their,

515
00:30:18.810 --> 00:30:20.950
the traditions that we create in culture,

516
00:30:21.190 --> 00:30:25.420
the arts language that the extraordinarily and indeed science,

517
00:30:25.610 --> 00:30:27.010
the extraordinarily complex,

518
00:30:27.011 --> 00:30:32.011
rich things we can create are all created by gradual incremental,

519
00:30:32.081 --> 00:30:35.920
one fourth of the time growth on this sort of great landscape.

520
00:30:36.550 --> 00:30:39.710
So here's something a bit more about focusing on our,
our creativity.

521
00:30:39.711 --> 00:30:43.690
I'll pull it up from a positive standpoint to here.
Here in this example,

522
00:30:43.691 --> 00:30:48.140
we have the wonderful creativity of perception.
So anyone who thinks,
uh,

523
00:30:48.270 --> 00:30:51.610
in a negative mood or like my,
uh,
some people in my family,

524
00:30:51.611 --> 00:30:54.820
he keeps saying things like this.
Well,
I'm just not,
I'm just not creative.
I just,

525
00:30:54.821 --> 00:30:57.610
yeah,
my brain just doesn't work that way.
Think again,

526
00:30:57.820 --> 00:30:59.800
when you look at this amazing image here,

527
00:30:59.890 --> 00:31:03.640
this is a image invented by a Japanese vision scientists,

528
00:31:03.750 --> 00:31:05.770
it Asawa and uh,

529
00:31:05.771 --> 00:31:09.640
of course you can see that it is a sphere,

530
00:31:10.270 --> 00:31:13.750
sort of like a sneaker ball or valuable white Billy Ball type of thing.

531
00:31:14.290 --> 00:31:15.280
Pretty three dimensional.

532
00:31:15.850 --> 00:31:18.100
And you can probably have a sense of though it's an illusion,

533
00:31:18.101 --> 00:31:19.420
but you happen to get the sense that the,

534
00:31:19.620 --> 00:31:24.190
the white and the ball ball area here is just a little brighter than the

535
00:31:24.191 --> 00:31:26.590
surrounding wine.
Of course,
that's not actually true.

536
00:31:27.340 --> 00:31:30.850
What's happening here is that you are taking these pieces,

537
00:31:30.851 --> 00:31:34.330
these exact pieces and turning them into a three dimensional object,

538
00:31:35.680 --> 00:31:40.620
a spiky sphere,
and that is an amazing thing.
So those exact spikes,
those,

539
00:31:40.621 --> 00:31:43.300
those fragments,
when they're organized in a special way,

540
00:31:43.510 --> 00:31:46.060
your brain immediately thinks,
oh,
I didn't see,

541
00:31:46.061 --> 00:31:48.910
I can see a clever way of organizing these.
It's like a puzzle,

542
00:31:48.911 --> 00:31:50.710
but the brain can easily,
easily see the answer.

543
00:31:51.070 --> 00:31:55.270
You can explain why those shapes are the way they are by thinking,
oh yeah,

544
00:31:55.360 --> 00:31:58.150
they're all about the same length spikes,
that clones,

545
00:31:58.151 --> 00:32:03.130
that lack there on a white sphere.
There's all kinds of um,
issues with,

546
00:32:03.410 --> 00:32:05.950
uh,
bits of bits being cut off by the background.

547
00:32:05.951 --> 00:32:07.390
So you can see this spike as well,
the short,

548
00:32:07.391 --> 00:32:10.940
but of course it is because it's pointing away from us and it's occluded by the

549
00:32:10.941 --> 00:32:14.290
billet bit of billiard ball.
And then this one for example,
is coming towards me.

550
00:32:14.380 --> 00:32:18.940
So all of this is perfectly explained by this amazing insight,

551
00:32:19.150 --> 00:32:22.750
but that amazing insight.
It's something your brain just creates in a flash.

552
00:32:23.560 --> 00:32:28.400
So it's not that you all brought your kind of porn or a kind of simple,
uh,

553
00:32:28.430 --> 00:32:31.240
queen show,
which is just being pulled or pushed around by your environment,

554
00:32:31.420 --> 00:32:34.360
your incredibly powerful organizing machine.
And that's,

555
00:32:34.361 --> 00:32:36.280
I think the reason you can only do one thing at a time.

556
00:32:37.150 --> 00:32:41.630
When you're deploying your concentration attention on a particular object you're

557
00:32:41.750 --> 00:32:46.330
able to bring to bear all the other stuff,
you know,
all experience you have of,

558
00:32:46.340 --> 00:32:47.480
um,
in this case,

559
00:32:47.630 --> 00:32:50.840
three dimensional objects can be brought to bear to make sense of this thing.

560
00:32:51.190 --> 00:32:54.710
That's a really hard thing to do and that's why you can only do one at a time.

561
00:32:54.711 --> 00:32:58.400
But don't underestimate the spectacular inventiveness required to do it.

562
00:32:58.401 --> 00:33:02.410
This is the possible number of objects that could under underpin this.
Um,

563
00:33:03.050 --> 00:33:06.620
this,
this,
this,
this set of markings on the page is vast,

564
00:33:06.830 --> 00:33:09.920
but your brain immediately thinks,
oh,
white sphere spikes.

565
00:33:12.050 --> 00:33:17.000
Another illustration is,
uh,
faces.
So here are some found faces,

566
00:33:17.270 --> 00:33:20.850
faces.
It just happened to be in new world and now they'll have these faces.
Um,

567
00:33:20.900 --> 00:33:22.760
I think one of the things that's nice about it is first of all,

568
00:33:22.761 --> 00:33:25.730
we immediately see them and they are nothing like faces.
Are they?
I mean,

569
00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:27.800
nothing like the faces that we see every day.

570
00:33:28.100 --> 00:33:30.950
The really have to take a massive creative leap to think,

571
00:33:31.130 --> 00:33:34.190
well you could sort of thing that's sort of a little like an iron that's a

572
00:33:34.191 --> 00:33:35.650
little like an iron as a little like a nose.

573
00:33:35.651 --> 00:33:38.360
And I suppose this is a kind of like a mouth,
not very much.

574
00:33:38.570 --> 00:33:43.570
You have to make an enormous metaphorical jump to get from [inaudible] faces of

575
00:33:44.181 --> 00:33:46.250
actual people to these.
However,

576
00:33:46.730 --> 00:33:50.180
your brain's really good and making creative metaphorical jumps and it does.

577
00:33:50.480 --> 00:33:54.260
The other thing I want to stress here is just how emotional these faces are.

578
00:33:55.430 --> 00:34:00.230
Just as emotional as any lane with with emotion has any um,
real human face.

579
00:34:00.620 --> 00:34:01.453
For example,

580
00:34:01.490 --> 00:34:06.470
there's a kind of anger to this face but also a slight kind of cross eyed sort

581
00:34:06.471 --> 00:34:10.280
of loopiness and you're not quite sure whether to be afraid of this face or,

582
00:34:10.520 --> 00:34:12.050
or to think is slightly ridiculous.

583
00:34:12.230 --> 00:34:16.670
This is an eager to please face it really wants you to like it.

584
00:34:16.850 --> 00:34:19.490
It's trying to look kind of happy,
but it's not.

585
00:34:19.530 --> 00:34:23.300
It feels like I'm trying to hold things together,
but I'm not quite sure I can.

586
00:34:23.690 --> 00:34:28.460
You said cheese grater,
but nonetheless,
that's how it seems.
What about this,

587
00:34:28.461 --> 00:34:32.450
this fellow here that he's kind of a benign face,
little meant drunken,

588
00:34:32.750 --> 00:34:34.970
not it wouldn't want to ask them a difficult question,

589
00:34:35.300 --> 00:34:39.560
is lucky a little bit like he's a little lost,
but nonetheless,
um,
it's,

590
00:34:39.750 --> 00:34:42.620
it's a friendly face.
This poor fellow,

591
00:34:43.160 --> 00:34:46.440
this face here is very,
very concerned.
There's a,

592
00:34:46.441 --> 00:34:49.880
there's a definite sense of fear and confusion.
It doesn't know what's going on,

593
00:34:49.881 --> 00:34:52.670
but it's not good.
Now,
how is that possible?

594
00:34:52.680 --> 00:34:55.010
How is it that we not only see that these are phases,

595
00:34:55.011 --> 00:34:57.270
but we impose such richness on him?
He's the amazing,

596
00:34:57.480 --> 00:35:00.530
of course these faces don't really have it in our life,

597
00:35:00.770 --> 00:35:04.220
but we impose in alive repose,
interpretation on everything,

598
00:35:04.820 --> 00:35:09.530
including each other,
including ourselves.
To finish,

599
00:35:09.531 --> 00:35:13.220
I want to finish with an analogy.
Going back to the,
the metaphor.

600
00:35:13.221 --> 00:35:15.230
The mind is flat and the idea of mental death.

601
00:35:16.730 --> 00:35:21.590
And I want to do that by pointing out some lovely fingers by a,

602
00:35:21.650 --> 00:35:22.610
uh,

603
00:35:23.060 --> 00:35:27.530
an artist in earlier in the middle of the 20th century,

604
00:35:27.650 --> 00:35:30.770
Oscar Reuters filed and a,

605
00:35:30.771 --> 00:35:34.210
he produced what many of you will think of as Asher,
like,
um,

606
00:35:34.240 --> 00:35:35.530
the stimulus if you know,
you know,

607
00:35:35.540 --> 00:35:39.570
and many of you will know Escher but around was around the same time in some

608
00:35:39.571 --> 00:35:44.180
cases before Asher and never all the beautiful in here.
Awesome stamps.

609
00:35:44.210 --> 00:35:48.650
He's a Swede and the Swedish postal service use some of these figures on a

610
00:35:48.651 --> 00:35:51.890
famous set of steps.
Now the nice thing about all of these,

611
00:35:51.891 --> 00:35:55.340
if they are impossible figures,
so if you look at them casually,

612
00:35:55.341 --> 00:35:58.280
you think there's just some blocky three dimensional objects.

613
00:35:58.700 --> 00:36:01.700
If you look more closely,
you start to think,
hmm,
which,

614
00:36:01.701 --> 00:36:05.360
where's the front of my is the back of this thing and the offer further pop

615
00:36:05.361 --> 00:36:05.901
contemplation,

616
00:36:05.901 --> 00:36:08.750
you start to realize these figures actually don't make any sense at all.

617
00:36:09.350 --> 00:36:10.670
So if you look at this one,
for example,

618
00:36:10.671 --> 00:36:14.090
this is a essentially the Penrose triangle as the voice of odd invented the

619
00:36:14.091 --> 00:36:16.560
Penrose triangle around the same time,
um,

620
00:36:17.420 --> 00:36:22.370
as Penrose at Penrose is a original paper completely independently.
Um,

621
00:36:22.880 --> 00:36:27.120
and this one,
so that's that.
So it looks like,
um,

622
00:36:27.310 --> 00:36:31.310
for starting here,
say it looks like we're going back,
that we go back,

623
00:36:31.311 --> 00:36:33.200
we're going space further and further away.

624
00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:37.010
Now let's go down here and we're going back further the further we go.

625
00:36:37.340 --> 00:36:40.130
And then we've gone back and gone back into steps.

626
00:36:40.131 --> 00:36:43.940
We've gone back further into debt and now we're just going vertically as level

627
00:36:43.941 --> 00:36:46.760
in depth and yet we end up where we started.
That's a bit weird.

628
00:36:47.060 --> 00:36:49.340
So it's like I started here,
I went back a bit,

629
00:36:49.400 --> 00:36:53.240
then it went back a bit more and then it went up and I ended up where I start.

630
00:36:53.820 --> 00:36:56.430
That can't be right,
can it?
Um,
and indeed it can't be right.

631
00:36:56.460 --> 00:37:00.990
This is not a possible three dimensional objects.
Uh,
what about this one?

632
00:37:00.991 --> 00:37:02.100
Same sort of thing.

633
00:37:02.970 --> 00:37:07.970
Just trace trace rounds here and you'll find something very old happens as soon

634
00:37:08.261 --> 00:37:10.800
as you start to loop back to where you started with just this.

635
00:37:10.801 --> 00:37:13.620
This just makes no sense.
Similarly,
this one too,

636
00:37:15.870 --> 00:37:18.030
these are very interesting in themselves.

637
00:37:18.450 --> 00:37:19.860
When you think about what they mean for vision,

638
00:37:20.100 --> 00:37:23.760
because that's telling us that we're only able to organize one part of the

639
00:37:23.761 --> 00:37:26.790
stimulus at once.
If we get to organize the whole stimulus,

640
00:37:27.150 --> 00:37:29.280
these are very simple compared to the world around us.

641
00:37:29.281 --> 00:37:32.790
We should immediately say these are impossible.
The light should be,

642
00:37:32.791 --> 00:37:36.780
the alarm bells should be going off because if we could try to integrate this

643
00:37:36.781 --> 00:37:38.460
entire stimulus in one go,

644
00:37:38.670 --> 00:37:42.180
we'd fail because it doesn't have any an interpretation and we think,
oh,

645
00:37:42.181 --> 00:37:43.200
impossible objects,

646
00:37:43.650 --> 00:37:47.610
but in fact we only realize it's an impossible object by going slowly.
We think,

647
00:37:47.611 --> 00:37:51.240
well that'd be,
it makes sense that it makes sense that it makes sense.
Oh,

648
00:37:51.241 --> 00:37:53.430
but hang on.
I'm trying to piece them together.
Oh,

649
00:37:53.610 --> 00:37:57.210
they don't fit together and that it's an effort for slow,
difficult thing.

650
00:37:58.740 --> 00:38:01.830
But so that's interesting in itself because it's an illustration of the

651
00:38:01.831 --> 00:38:04.260
sequential local aspect of vision.
You can't,

652
00:38:04.410 --> 00:38:09.410
you feel you can in some sense see the whole object and you can see that it's

653
00:38:09.571 --> 00:38:10.141
three dimensional.

654
00:38:10.141 --> 00:38:12.540
But that must be an illusion because if you could really see it,

655
00:38:12.541 --> 00:38:15.330
you'd realize it wasn't three dimensional,
but it's an,

656
00:38:15.331 --> 00:38:17.100
it's an interesting illustration in another way.

657
00:38:17.940 --> 00:38:21.180
These are stimulated that look locally lighten.
I have depth.

658
00:38:21.510 --> 00:38:24.780
You look at any piece of them,
perfectly reasonable depth like object.

659
00:38:24.781 --> 00:38:28.470
You try and put the different pieces together.
They do not fit together.

660
00:38:29.100 --> 00:38:32.400
And that is a very interesting analogy for the mind.
In general.

661
00:38:33.020 --> 00:38:36.910
It's if I ask you to explain your actions or justify your beliefs,

662
00:38:37.050 --> 00:38:41.110
you all tell me a story of why did you come up to commute to work.
Oh,

663
00:38:41.111 --> 00:38:44.860
I have a story for that.
Um,
you know,
why did you,
you maybe you take,

664
00:38:44.861 --> 00:38:46.780
take the tube that's a which tube.

665
00:38:46.780 --> 00:38:49.360
Well you have a story for that and I asked you more questions.

666
00:38:49.361 --> 00:38:52.210
That will be more stories.
And more and more and more.

667
00:38:52.240 --> 00:38:55.550
And they all sound very convincing.
I just like eat punch of the image,

668
00:38:55.551 --> 00:38:56.470
which looks three dimensional.

669
00:38:57.340 --> 00:39:01.090
But if I try and get you to put those stories together,
they will not make sense.

670
00:39:01.660 --> 00:39:04.590
And this is the thing that people realize in artificial intelligence in the 70s

671
00:39:04.800 --> 00:39:08.830
and before when they started to try to get knowledge out of experts.

672
00:39:09.190 --> 00:39:12.820
So you'd think the experts now how they do things.
So he just asked them,
well,

673
00:39:12.850 --> 00:39:17.020
you're an expert chess player,
so what did you do in this position and why?

674
00:39:17.320 --> 00:39:20.470
You tell me and expert just less of,
well,
this is obviously the right move.

675
00:39:20.471 --> 00:39:24.830
And um,
uh,
well here's the story.
But then you do it again and again and again.

676
00:39:24.850 --> 00:39:27.310
The story is do not make any sense.
They are not going to hear it.

677
00:39:27.490 --> 00:39:28.690
He didn't story sounds fine,

678
00:39:28.810 --> 00:39:32.050
but they do not fit together because they are rationalizing.

679
00:39:32.260 --> 00:39:34.930
They're not really going in and saying,
Oh yeah,
actually I have this,
um,

680
00:39:35.310 --> 00:39:38.170
and have this deep insight into my mind.
I can just look into,

681
00:39:38.250 --> 00:39:40.930
look at these inner thoughts.
No,
they can't do that.

682
00:39:41.890 --> 00:39:44.620
What they're doing is they're rationalizing and a rationalizing in a very

683
00:39:44.621 --> 00:39:48.520
convincing way.
But all the different bits of rationalization don't fit together.

684
00:39:49.330 --> 00:39:54.250
So I think in fact,
there's a bind,
just flat cover,
uh,
has,
uh,
uh,

685
00:39:54.251 --> 00:39:57.790
exactly this quality,
uh,
has,
uh,
has the look of a three dimensional object.

686
00:39:57.791 --> 00:39:58.624
But it isn't.

687
00:39:58.720 --> 00:40:02.710
And this is to illustrate the idea that actually your mind itself as you

688
00:40:02.711 --> 00:40:05.890
traditionally conceive it as we traditionally conceive ourselves is itself an

689
00:40:05.891 --> 00:40:06.820
impossible object.

690
00:40:07.360 --> 00:40:10.710
We imagine that I don't just have one or two beliefs that I've just thought of

691
00:40:10.711 --> 00:40:15.620
at the moment.
Uh,
each,
each belief is justified by huge networker bleed.

692
00:40:15.640 --> 00:40:20.590
It just goes on forever.
And my motives,
I can think of one or two,

693
00:40:20.591 --> 00:40:22.000
but there must be many,
many of them.

694
00:40:22.150 --> 00:40:25.600
And they themselves were all carefully into linkedin and intertwined.

695
00:40:26.200 --> 00:40:28.180
But in fact,
as you students,
you start to explore that.

696
00:40:28.181 --> 00:40:29.080
And that's quite a big theme of it.

697
00:40:29.081 --> 00:40:30.640
But which I haven't really talked about today.

698
00:40:31.010 --> 00:40:34.920
If you soon as you try to articulate and explore the connections between all

699
00:40:34.940 --> 00:40:38.200
those different snippets of information,
snippets of beliefs,

700
00:40:38.201 --> 00:40:40.780
snippets and motivation,
if they do not fit together,

701
00:40:41.050 --> 00:40:46.050
in fact your mind is impossible object and just the same sense as a rotor,

702
00:40:46.861 --> 00:40:51.730
Vod or ashes,
strange,
impossible objects.
So I think the,

703
00:40:51.750 --> 00:40:56.750
the take home message is that we are amazingly any creative stupendously free,

704
00:40:58.950 --> 00:41:02.700
uh,
improvisers and each improvisation has done at the,

705
00:41:02.720 --> 00:41:07.510
on the basis of the last improvisation and were so convincing that we think

706
00:41:07.511 --> 00:41:12.160
there's a script he said like improvising improvisational actors who are so
good.

707
00:41:12.161 --> 00:41:14.200
You Think,
oh,
you need to learn that haven't you?

708
00:41:14.350 --> 00:41:16.940
Somebody wrote that script for your,
you're reading it,
but there is no skip.

709
00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:21.160
They are improvising and were so fluent,
were so good that we don't realize.

710
00:41:21.161 --> 00:41:24.910
In fact,
we're making it up as we go along.
Thank you very much.

00:41:36.500 --> 00:41:40.460
So I don't really know how this is different from exactly what fried said.

714
00:41:41.030 --> 00:41:45.460
I mean there we have a set of illusions,
um,

715
00:41:45.870 --> 00:41:48.020
you know,
slips of the tongue and whatever that had,

716
00:41:48.170 --> 00:41:52.080
that are created by the dynamics of improvisation.
You've,

717
00:41:52.130 --> 00:41:54.650
you created this kind of strange thing called descript.

718
00:41:54.740 --> 00:41:56.870
Everybody knows it's not a script actually.

719
00:41:56.871 --> 00:42:01.690
There's some internal generative processes which produce,
um,

720
00:42:02.060 --> 00:42:06.920
uh,
perceptions and these can be more or less integrated a different people.

721
00:42:06.921 --> 00:42:11.390
So I just want to know exactly,
you know,
it seems as if Freud was here,
uh,

722
00:42:11.391 --> 00:42:14.600
if Freud was,
he wouldn't have any problem with anything you were saying.

723
00:42:14.601 --> 00:42:18.680
So I can you just deal with the deathly blowed the whole thing?

724
00:42:18.720 --> 00:42:21.300
<v 0>Yeah.
Yeah.
I,
I,
I'd like to think Floyd words.</v>

725
00:42:21.510 --> 00:42:23.760
I'd be delighted if we turned out to agree,

726
00:42:23.880 --> 00:42:27.150
but I think he wouldn't because for Freud's,
the,

727
00:42:27.480 --> 00:42:31.980
the conscious is only a tiny fragments of thought.

728
00:42:32.190 --> 00:42:34.560
So too,
I would agree that there's a lot of stuff.

729
00:42:34.620 --> 00:42:37.410
The brain's doing a lot of stuff we're not conscious of.
In fact,
everything.

730
00:42:37.411 --> 00:42:37.891
Pretty much.

731
00:42:37.891 --> 00:42:41.460
The only thing is we are conscious of and are essentially a sensory experiences.

732
00:42:41.490 --> 00:42:46.140
And I would include in that
imagery and also language.

733
00:42:46.440 --> 00:42:49.050
But essentially we're only conscious of very narrow sensory experiences.

734
00:42:49.051 --> 00:42:53.910
That's it.
But I think for Freud he'd say,
no,
no,
that's right.

735
00:42:53.911 --> 00:42:57.300
You're,
you're hungry.
The,
the,
those are the thoughts you're conscious of.

736
00:42:57.480 --> 00:43:00.000
But there are other things which are a bit like that.
They're just hidden.

737
00:43:00.690 --> 00:43:04.110
So there's something else,
which is,
it'd be,
like Freud would say,

738
00:43:04.350 --> 00:43:07.560
I think there's an iceberg and you can,
there's a tip of the iceberg,

739
00:43:08.070 --> 00:43:09.990
which is the conscious thoughts.
And then below that,

740
00:43:09.991 --> 00:43:14.010
there are all kinds of other con unconscious processes.
Now I want to say,
no,

741
00:43:14.011 --> 00:43:17.630
that's an iceberg metaphor is,
is a mistake.
There's the,
the,
the,

742
00:43:17.631 --> 00:43:18.780
the things that as it were,

743
00:43:18.781 --> 00:43:21.960
a visible or nothing like the things that are invisible.
And so what,

744
00:43:21.970 --> 00:43:26.970
what's invisible is essentially the vast tradition of vast history of previous

745
00:43:27.180 --> 00:43:30.780
thoughts you've had and what you're doing when you're coping with the current

746
00:43:30.781 --> 00:43:35.760
situation is your drawing on all those past experiences of previous situations.

747
00:43:35.910 --> 00:43:39.840
You're in all actually there's no,
as it were,
underlying generative mechanism.

748
00:43:39.841 --> 00:43:43.200
You can,
you can,
uh,
refer to all you've got is as it were,

749
00:43:43.201 --> 00:43:46.640
lateral connections between,
between,
uh,
one thought and the next.

750
00:43:47.100 --> 00:43:49.280
<v 3>So it's a disagreement about the content of that,</v>

751
00:43:49.450 --> 00:43:51.270
the nature of the things underneath.

752
00:43:51.570 --> 00:43:53.910
Because I suppose when you're describing those illusions to us,

753
00:43:53.911 --> 00:43:56.700
what you're doing is equivalent to a kind of therapy in,
in,
in,

754
00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:01.350
in making conscious,
into thoughts,
the processes that resulted in that illusion.

755
00:44:02.470 --> 00:44:04.800
<v 0>Yes.
Although I,
that's absolutely right.</v>

756
00:44:05.010 --> 00:44:09.690
But the way I would think of it is that we think of it as a process where

757
00:44:09.691 --> 00:44:12.450
something that was previous to unconscious is now con conscious.

758
00:44:12.810 --> 00:44:16.530
But I think that's,
it sounds by mistake.
I think the,

759
00:44:16.830 --> 00:44:18.780
it's not that there was a fault,

760
00:44:18.840 --> 00:44:21.540
which I wasn't aware of and now I am aware of it.

761
00:44:21.870 --> 00:44:25.820
It's empty that the mechanisms are completely and utterly,
utterly different.
Um,

762
00:44:26.220 --> 00:44:29.700
so for example,
if you think about the patterns in language forever,
they're very,

763
00:44:29.701 --> 00:44:33.780
very complicated.
We learn,
it appears in a very exemplar based way.

764
00:44:33.930 --> 00:44:36.870
So I hear different phrases,
I generalize from those phrases.

765
00:44:37.140 --> 00:44:39.450
I grabbed the assembler language as a child.

766
00:44:39.660 --> 00:44:41.580
And that language has all kinds of complicated patterns.

767
00:44:41.760 --> 00:44:43.830
And as a linguist you might say,
Oh look,
you,

768
00:44:43.900 --> 00:44:47.370
you didn't know about this complicated rule or pattern,
did you?
Um,

769
00:44:47.670 --> 00:44:49.140
and the answer is absolutely not.

770
00:44:50.100 --> 00:44:53.760
The explicit task of finding patterns in language is a total mystery to me,

771
00:44:54.330 --> 00:44:57.960
but I think what's going on there is not that you're making it explicit to be

772
00:44:57.961 --> 00:44:59.130
something that I sort of knew.

773
00:44:59.460 --> 00:45:02.700
It's just that I've learned all these fragments and these fragments create this

774
00:45:02.701 --> 00:45:04.920
pattern and I never do nothing about the pattern.

775
00:45:04.921 --> 00:45:06.360
Only only knew about the fragments,

776
00:45:06.630 --> 00:45:11.570
the things I know about or things that are always either that conscious now will

777
00:45:11.571 --> 00:45:14.430
they were so yes,
it's a deal.
It's a disagreement about it as it were,

778
00:45:14.431 --> 00:45:18.340
what the substrate is.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.

779
00:45:18.360 --> 00:45:21.610
This is an important question.
That's too bad.

780
00:45:21.740 --> 00:45:26.160
Especially when you argue with Saquon list,
would would tread say,
yeah,

781
00:45:26.161 --> 00:45:30.120
I agree completely with their landscape image,
except that the landscape,

782
00:45:30.420 --> 00:45:34.680
he's moving by itself.
Your is changing.
We had the drops.
Yes.

783
00:45:34.681 --> 00:45:39.570
I think that's probably right actually.
So I'm very much hostile to the idea,

784
00:45:39.760 --> 00:45:42.420
which I think there's not much experimental evidence that the landscape is

785
00:45:42.421 --> 00:45:46.710
moving by itself.
Um,
I mean,
in fact the brain,

786
00:45:46.750 --> 00:45:48.480
when you're focusing on a particular task,

787
00:45:48.481 --> 00:45:50.880
your entire brain witness is too extreme,

788
00:45:50.881 --> 00:45:54.480
but large areas of your brain are really focused on whatever that task is.

789
00:45:54.690 --> 00:45:57.870
So if you're,
you're reading word,
you're listening to a piece of music.

790
00:45:57.990 --> 00:46:00.210
If you're locked on to that stimulus,

791
00:46:00.510 --> 00:46:02.730
we've vast tracks of your brain will be active in,

792
00:46:02.731 --> 00:46:03.870
in locking on to that stimulus.

793
00:46:04.050 --> 00:46:06.570
Now of course there's lots of autonomous stuff going on.

794
00:46:06.570 --> 00:46:08.550
You're still breathing is not falling over.

795
00:46:08.730 --> 00:46:12.180
There's all kinds of things which are actually relatively separable from,

796
00:46:12.181 --> 00:46:15.330
from general cognition,
but high level cognition,

797
00:46:15.331 --> 00:46:18.250
the ability to freely,
um,

798
00:46:18.680 --> 00:46:22.110
it's our 10 to one thing and then the next seems to be roughly sequential and

799
00:46:22.111 --> 00:46:26.220
whatever it's locking onto it that at any given moment is roughly obliterating

800
00:46:26.250 --> 00:46:29.880
the possibility of locking onto anything else.
So I think that's exactly right.

801
00:46:29.881 --> 00:46:34.370
I think the,
uh,
the,
um,
the uh,
at least,
uh,

802
00:46:34.380 --> 00:46:38.430
port Pirie illusion we have is that as well as the conscious processing that's

803
00:46:38.431 --> 00:46:41.640
going on my brain just doing all kinds of secret posting in the background.

804
00:46:41.641 --> 00:46:44.490
Just thinking about the kinds of things I normally think about,

805
00:46:44.580 --> 00:46:46.170
but thinking about him in the background.

806
00:46:46.440 --> 00:46:48.270
Whereas I think the brain is thinking about lots of other things,

807
00:46:48.271 --> 00:46:51.210
but they're things like not falling over.
They're very different in character

808
00:46:53.340 --> 00:46:55.640
and different sorts of question.
Um,

809
00:46:56.310 --> 00:47:00.240
one characteristic of many autistic people is that they find it difficult to

810
00:47:00.241 --> 00:47:02.100
infer emotional from faces.

811
00:47:02.680 --> 00:47:07.590
What is your theory to say about that?
That is a very interesting question.

812
00:47:07.720 --> 00:47:10.140
I mean,
I don't have any specialized knowledge here,

813
00:47:10.141 --> 00:47:14.640
but I do think it's possible at least it's interesting to imagine that perhaps

814
00:47:14.670 --> 00:47:19.260
the big problem is the contextual,
uh,
integration of context,

815
00:47:19.470 --> 00:47:20.880
which I think,
I know some theories of,

816
00:47:21.180 --> 00:47:26.180
of autism do focus on the idea that I'm generally trying to create her holds out

817
00:47:26.611 --> 00:47:31.510
of many individual parts is quite difficult and there's a tendency to focus if

818
00:47:31.511 --> 00:47:32.530
you have autism on,

819
00:47:32.600 --> 00:47:36.340
on parts and analyze those parts very in detail rather than be able to
integrate.

820
00:47:36.760 --> 00:47:41.440
So it could be at least one part of the story could be that I'm trying to

821
00:47:41.441 --> 00:47:45.100
interpret faces requires this Wharton,
this integration,

822
00:47:45.101 --> 00:47:46.540
not just the view of the visual stimulus,

823
00:47:46.541 --> 00:47:49.270
but actually all of this surrounding surrounding stimulus,

824
00:47:49.271 --> 00:47:50.350
which may be difficult to do.

825
00:47:53.730 --> 00:47:56.670
<v 4>Your,
some of your definitions seem a bit too otologist.</v>

826
00:47:56.671 --> 00:48:01.470
So you say you can only,
there's only conscious thoughts,

827
00:48:01.471 --> 00:48:05.460
but you define thoughts as things which are conscious and you say you can only

828
00:48:05.461 --> 00:48:06.600
do one thing at once.

829
00:48:06.601 --> 00:48:09.990
But say my hobby is dancing and while dancing with a partner,

830
00:48:09.991 --> 00:48:14.250
I can hold a conversation with her and you would say,
oh you only,

831
00:48:14.400 --> 00:48:18.540
the only thing you're actually doing is the conversation and the dancing doesn't

832
00:48:18.560 --> 00:48:23.000
counters a thing because you're doing it at the same time.
So it feels a bit,

833
00:48:23.080 --> 00:48:26.500
<v 0>yeah,
no,
you let me,
let me,
let me just make that a bit more precise.
So,
so the,</v>

834
00:48:26.680 --> 00:48:29.590
the thing that the right,
the more correct story,

835
00:48:29.591 --> 00:48:34.060
but a bit more complicated story would be to say any bit of brain I would argue

836
00:48:34.061 --> 00:48:35.230
can only do one thing at a time.

837
00:48:35.231 --> 00:48:38.620
So you've got complicated set of networks in your brain.
If those,

838
00:48:38.621 --> 00:48:41.320
if those network though each network and only do one thing at a time.

839
00:48:41.560 --> 00:48:45.610
Now if it's the case that you can take on two tasks,
which as it happens,

840
00:48:46.150 --> 00:48:48.460
do not use overlapping networks,
then you're fine.

841
00:48:49.300 --> 00:48:50.880
Now if you're beginning dancing,

842
00:48:50.920 --> 00:48:54.010
this is not the case because there's so much top down control,

843
00:48:54.370 --> 00:48:57.280
which was required to keep me,
keep me doing the right moves in right order.

844
00:48:57.460 --> 00:48:58.980
Then there's a lot of overlap between this,

845
00:48:59.060 --> 00:49:03.710
the same top down mechanisms that you need to run a conversation but but so for,

846
00:49:03.770 --> 00:49:04.060
for,

847
00:49:04.060 --> 00:49:07.510
for too complicated tasks you're done for but for things that you've done a lot,

848
00:49:07.511 --> 00:49:11.260
some,
some tasks are,
are um,
are,
are possible to,
to run in parallel.

849
00:49:11.610 --> 00:49:14.200
Now an example I talked about in the book is very,

850
00:49:14.201 --> 00:49:17.800
very nice example of touch typing and sight reading.

851
00:49:17.980 --> 00:49:22.810
So you get 'em so you get,
is that right?
Yeah,
no sight,
sight,
reading,

852
00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:28.000
sight reading and shadowing.
That's the one I want to focus on.

853
00:49:28.150 --> 00:49:31.120
So here you are as a very experienced pianist,

854
00:49:31.330 --> 00:49:35.290
your site or any piece of music and also you're hearing in your ear a voice and

855
00:49:35.291 --> 00:49:39.700
you just have to say what the voice is saying and wonderfully you can do that.

856
00:49:39.870 --> 00:49:42.040
I not,
if you're not a very good pianist you're totally fail.

857
00:49:42.041 --> 00:49:45.850
But if you're a good pianist,
the sight reading is relatively autonomous process.

858
00:49:46.240 --> 00:49:47.500
This,
the re re re,

859
00:49:47.501 --> 00:49:50.680
re generating what you're hearing is relative to autonomous process.

860
00:49:50.830 --> 00:49:53.140
It wouldn't be if it was in that language you weren't very familiar with,

861
00:49:53.141 --> 00:49:56.310
that will become a very hard process.
So it has to be strong.

862
00:49:56.311 --> 00:49:58.600
You automated processes and,
and so yes,

863
00:49:58.601 --> 00:50:03.070
there are a few examples where you can really cleanly see that the brain

864
00:50:03.071 --> 00:50:05.260
networks are not overlapping and then we're fine.

865
00:50:05.560 --> 00:50:07.940
But that's really the exception.
But they're very important exception.

866
00:50:07.941 --> 00:50:11.110
Very interesting assumptions are,
for example,
I should say,

867
00:50:11.230 --> 00:50:13.180
driving is actually not one of these exceptions.

868
00:50:13.181 --> 00:50:17.190
So if you happen to think as I'm driving along,
um,
I could have a chat on my,
my,

869
00:50:17.230 --> 00:50:19.480
my,
my hands free phone with no interference.

870
00:50:19.481 --> 00:50:22.480
You'd be absolutely wrongness lovely experiments showing it.
Um,

871
00:50:22.870 --> 00:50:25.930
even if you have to do the most trivial auditory task,

872
00:50:25.960 --> 00:50:29.420
monitor some auditory signal that really screws up your ability to break,

873
00:50:29.421 --> 00:50:30.050
for example.

874
00:50:30.050 --> 00:50:34.190
So that our intuitions about what we can automate and what we can do separately

875
00:50:34.520 --> 00:50:35.990
is not very,
not very good.

876
00:50:36.080 --> 00:50:39.110
Often we're actually swapping from task to task very quickly.

877
00:50:41.300 --> 00:50:44.960
My understanding is that sleep is used for the organization and memories.

878
00:50:45.320 --> 00:50:48.020
So how does that fit until theory?
Yeah.

879
00:50:48.021 --> 00:50:52.790
So I think it's not under,
it's not very well understood how sleep plays a role,

880
00:50:52.791 --> 00:50:54.350
but it does seem to play an important role.

881
00:50:54.740 --> 00:50:59.740
And I suppose this account can deal with that to the extent that that process is

882
00:51:00.861 --> 00:51:03.870
mediated by dreaming,
dreaming,
dreaming.

883
00:51:04.050 --> 00:51:06.710
You are just replaying and this is the whole replay theory.

884
00:51:06.711 --> 00:51:07.880
You get a lot in neuroscience.

885
00:51:08.030 --> 00:51:11.560
So the idea is that you're doing something a bit like being awake,
um,

886
00:51:11.750 --> 00:51:16.730
and your doing more flip preconscious flow of experience and that is allowing

887
00:51:16.731 --> 00:51:20.220
you to reprogram the system.
The,
if it's the case since.
So what,

888
00:51:20.300 --> 00:51:23.120
what does this approach rules out is the idea.

889
00:51:23.121 --> 00:51:27.500
There's some other process which is not going through the processes essentially

890
00:51:27.501 --> 00:51:30.800
of conscious experience,
which may be too strong.
I mean,
I'm not,

891
00:51:30.950 --> 00:51:32.960
this is a particularly strong view.
I think it's roughly right.

892
00:51:33.140 --> 00:51:36.640
There might be some,
some processes which,
uh,
which are,

893
00:51:36.660 --> 00:51:39.020
which are going on in a completely nonconscious level that,

894
00:51:39.350 --> 00:51:40.700
but I'm willing to keep going.

895
00:51:40.701 --> 00:51:45.400
We going with the strongest possible stolons until absolutely forced not to,
but,

896
00:51:45.460 --> 00:51:48.320
but I think that's,
I think as broadly,
right.
For example,

897
00:51:48.321 --> 00:51:52.430
if you give people problems to solve and you've,
they sleep on them,
yes,

898
00:51:52.431 --> 00:51:55.540
they're slightly quicker than if they hadn't slept on them to solve them when

899
00:51:55.541 --> 00:51:56.374
need to ask them again,

900
00:51:56.540 --> 00:51:59.270
and that seems to be pretty much entirely explained by the fact that they've

901
00:51:59.390 --> 00:52:03.050
forgotten the era four ways they started,
tried to solve them the first time.

902
00:52:03.380 --> 00:52:06.610
So I give you a problem.
You Think,
Oh,
is it?
Let this you're wrong.
If you,

903
00:52:06.620 --> 00:52:09.610
if you're right,
you solve it,
but if you do,
if you're wrong,
you get it,
you,
you,

904
00:52:09.611 --> 00:52:09.920
you,

905
00:52:09.920 --> 00:52:14.090
you come draw up the wrong mental set the wrong interpretation of the problem.

906
00:52:14.180 --> 00:52:17.750
You get stuck.
Then you go to sleep.
You've forgotten now and you're quick,

907
00:52:17.870 --> 00:52:21.080
but there's seems to be no evidence that you were solving the problem in your

908
00:52:21.081 --> 00:52:21.460
sleep.

909
00:52:21.460 --> 00:52:25.160
It's a really active reprocessing and though we intuitively feel we're doing

910
00:52:25.161 --> 00:52:28.370
that from time to time is almost certainly an illusion.

911
00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:33.180
<v 3>I can remember that about this.
I just wanted to make a remark.</v>

912
00:52:33.600 --> 00:52:34.590
Remember that Michelle is Uva.

913
00:52:34.620 --> 00:52:39.620
I think the discover of rim sleeping cats w suggested that you make of the dream

914
00:52:41.970 --> 00:52:45.510
as you re recall it in fact,
you don't recall the dreams.
You just make it happen.

915
00:52:45.870 --> 00:52:49.410
So that kind of goes in your,
uh,
we'd let you were saying,

916
00:52:49.411 --> 00:52:53.910
but my question was about thought with that language and Musky like

917
00:52:53.911 --> 00:52:54.661
mathematicians,

918
00:52:54.661 --> 00:52:59.661
like at [inaudible] and how they solve a problem by claiming a train.

919
00:53:01.670 --> 00:53:02.550
What you make of that.

920
00:53:03.120 --> 00:53:04.740
<v 0>Yeah,
I mean I think that's very,
very interesting.</v>

921
00:53:04.741 --> 00:53:08.230
So one person had discussed in the book is Pine Care,
right?
Who is,
yeah,

922
00:53:08.231 --> 00:53:13.231
this phenomenal geometric genius who was able to vote by in according to his own

923
00:53:15.060 --> 00:53:19.020
description in a very geometrical way to solve very deep problems and then sort

924
00:53:19.021 --> 00:53:21.550
of write down the symbols later.
And I think the,

925
00:53:21.551 --> 00:53:26.160
the fact that he was experiencing this imagistic Lee is not a tall,
um,

926
00:53:26.720 --> 00:53:28.920
and that's what he's conscious of that we were always conscious of is the,

927
00:53:29.130 --> 00:53:32.640
is the,
is a visual traces of the thoughts.
Um,

928
00:53:32.670 --> 00:53:35.040
but all you're ever conscious I think is the,
is the,

929
00:53:35.041 --> 00:53:37.890
is the sensory now clearly it must be that these,

930
00:53:37.891 --> 00:53:41.730
these thoughts as he's generating them and that being,

931
00:53:41.731 --> 00:53:45.430
I think created one by one in the moment is not the reading off from something

932
00:53:45.440 --> 00:53:47.240
that in a mathematical textbook.
Um,

933
00:53:47.580 --> 00:53:49.740
but he's creating these thoughts one in the moment,

934
00:53:49.920 --> 00:53:54.920
but all he's actually able to consciously report about is these kinds of images

935
00:53:55.201 --> 00:53:56.070
stick traces.

936
00:53:57.010 --> 00:54:00.120
They said [inaudible] all you're conscious of it is the surface of your
thoughts.

937
00:54:00.121 --> 00:54:01.590
Not Nothing,
nothing beyond that.

938
00:54:01.830 --> 00:54:04.650
But I do think the fact that people have a very strong sense of imagery being

939
00:54:04.651 --> 00:54:09.210
important in mathematics is absolutely very important.
Anything that's,
uh,
that's,

940
00:54:09.211 --> 00:54:12.090
uh,
epar phenomenon,
I think it's really,
well,
probably rather crucial.

941
00:54:19.020 --> 00:54:19.490
<v 2>Okay.</v>

942
00:54:19.490 --> 00:54:22.550
<v 0>Not necessarily.
I am,
however,</v>

943
00:54:22.730 --> 00:54:26.420
a great believer in the utility of the idea of free will.
So this is not,

944
00:54:26.650 --> 00:54:27.483
it's not an,
it's not,

945
00:54:27.590 --> 00:54:31.580
I completely believe in a deterministic world or we're just having to stick up

946
00:54:31.581 --> 00:54:33.940
to quantum mechanical effects.
But some,

947
00:54:34.910 --> 00:54:39.910
I think the intuition we have of having of our sales being free is that we have

948
00:54:39.950 --> 00:54:43.000
the ability to create,
um,
the,
ah,

949
00:54:43.050 --> 00:54:46.610
the interpretation of the presence and interpretation of what we should do in

950
00:54:46.640 --> 00:54:49.130
freshly in the moment.
And I think that's absolutely right.

951
00:54:49.520 --> 00:54:51.740
So you could have a story which says,
well,
you're,

952
00:54:51.741 --> 00:54:54.920
you're kind of in a behaviorist,
a nightmare.
You've,
you've,

953
00:54:54.950 --> 00:54:59.100
you've laid down various associations and a stimulus comes along and he just

954
00:54:59.360 --> 00:55:04.360
find yourself on a unavoidably charging towards the fridge and eating cheese or

955
00:55:04.911 --> 00:55:07.610
whatever because of that bell and it's no stopping it.

956
00:55:07.730 --> 00:55:11.660
That would be a very different story.
I think we're extraordinarily clever,

957
00:55:11.661 --> 00:55:12.494
creative,

958
00:55:12.590 --> 00:55:15.980
sort of metaphorical creatures who are able to be very flexible in our behavior.

959
00:55:16.190 --> 00:55:21.080
Now you might say,
well,
but at base it's all determined.
It isn't it really.
Um,

960
00:55:21.200 --> 00:55:23.480
and I think the answer to that is,
is it an answer?

961
00:55:23.481 --> 00:55:25.630
Quine I think probably goes back beer for four that said,

962
00:55:25.631 --> 00:55:28.340
the philosopher Queen has this nice comment that that says,

963
00:55:28.680 --> 00:55:32.990
well of course free will's about being free to do as you will.

964
00:55:33.410 --> 00:55:36.680
It's not about being,
it's one about being free to will as you will.

965
00:55:37.100 --> 00:55:40.730
So there's something kind of in here any bonkers about that idea.
So these,

966
00:55:40.731 --> 00:55:45.290
those big free is to have the ability to,
to think flexibly,

967
00:55:45.470 --> 00:55:47.300
decide what you want to do and to do it.

968
00:55:47.600 --> 00:55:52.600
Not being free is being controlled by impulses that continually takeover and

969
00:55:52.761 --> 00:55:54.500
force you down channels you didn't want to go down.

970
00:55:54.880 --> 00:55:59.330
So that's a sort of soft science.
He not deep philosophical,
deep a solution,

971
00:55:59.331 --> 00:56:02.630
but I,
yeah,
I like the idea of free will.
Um,
I think,

972
00:56:02.631 --> 00:56:05.630
I think it's actually a deep and meaningful intuition about this and I think it

973
00:56:05.780 --> 00:56:08.170
distinguishes from lots of other,
um,
other

974
00:56:08.370 --> 00:56:09.203
<v 2>inches.</v>

975
00:56:11.550 --> 00:56:14.810
<v 0>It seems common to get insights that appear fairly fully formed.</v>

976
00:56:14.880 --> 00:56:17.950
Say when all showing or some discounts the blue,

977
00:56:18.440 --> 00:56:21.780
how might that kind of thing like be explained?
Yeah.
Well,

978
00:56:21.781 --> 00:56:25.690
I think there's quite a lot of work on this in the world of problem solving

979
00:56:25.691 --> 00:56:29.200
research and what seems to be going on is that your,

980
00:56:30.190 --> 00:56:34.720
you've got a lot of prior thinking then you have a clue that you hadn't thought

981
00:56:34.721 --> 00:56:37.420
of before or a little insights you think,
ah,

982
00:56:37.450 --> 00:56:40.660
maybe maybe this'll work and mostly it doesn't.

983
00:56:40.870 --> 00:56:44.410
So that the illusion is that when,
when it does work you think,
oh yeah,

984
00:56:44.411 --> 00:56:47.740
the whole thing is clear to me now because now I see roughly how it's going to

985
00:56:47.741 --> 00:56:50.080
go and look.
Oh I'm putting the pieces in.
Oh no,
they all fit.

986
00:56:50.230 --> 00:56:54.490
I sort of saw that all along.
I think that's a sort of retrospective Craig,

987
00:56:54.790 --> 00:56:56.770
because we all equally and I said you have this a lot.

988
00:56:56.770 --> 00:57:00.220
You probably all do you have a problem,
you think,
Oh I think this is it.
Um,

989
00:57:00.610 --> 00:57:03.520
and in fact it isn't.
Now you try to put the pieces together.
Nope,

990
00:57:03.580 --> 00:57:06.730
no that doesn't work.
Okay,
let's do it again and wait.

991
00:57:06.760 --> 00:57:10.240
But when it does work you have the feeling that Oh yeah,

992
00:57:10.260 --> 00:57:15.220
why I did see there correctly all the pieces fitting together.
Cause they it.
Um,

993
00:57:15.250 --> 00:57:17.740
but I think actually that's,
that's a,
that's a bit of a bit of an illusion.

994
00:57:18.850 --> 00:57:22.570
So there's an awful lots of a lot of artists and scientists have the,

995
00:57:23.470 --> 00:57:26.590
the um,
uh,
the story about saying,
Oh,

996
00:57:27.120 --> 00:57:31.420
and in a single moment I suddenly vividly completely saw the entire score of my

997
00:57:31.421 --> 00:57:32.254
Sonata.

998
00:57:32.710 --> 00:57:35.620
But when on press being pressed is how well he did actually take me like two

999
00:57:35.621 --> 00:57:38.590
weeks to write it.
You know,
a lot of hard thinking of,

1000
00:57:38.600 --> 00:57:41.560
I sort of saw how it was generally going and I think that sense of,

1001
00:57:41.561 --> 00:57:45.450
I sort of see the whole eight all clear to me now is something that is a,

1002
00:57:45.451 --> 00:57:48.580
there's a slight selection bias there.
Um,
however,

1003
00:57:48.581 --> 00:57:52.960
of course it's still true that sometimes you do have organizing thoughts which

1004
00:57:52.961 --> 00:57:54.880
allow you to see something in a more abstract way,

1005
00:57:54.881 --> 00:57:58.300
which it does actually give you the structure which will help everything fit

1006
00:57:58.301 --> 00:58:01.600
together.
But there you're thinking it'd be like seeing a phage and thinking,

1007
00:58:01.720 --> 00:58:02.920
I'm not just seeing the face.

1008
00:58:03.040 --> 00:58:07.210
I'm also seeing the eyes and the eyelids and the pupils and you're not right.

1009
00:58:07.260 --> 00:58:10.150
When you're seeing the face,
you're seeing the face,
you look at the eye,

1010
00:58:10.151 --> 00:58:13.830
you're not seeing the face it.
So we have the illusion.
When you see it,

1011
00:58:13.831 --> 00:58:15.220
or as you're looking at a whole body,

1012
00:58:15.400 --> 00:58:17.770
you really aren't in a very real sense seeing the face anymore.

1013
00:58:18.190 --> 00:58:19.180
But we have the illusion.

1014
00:58:19.181 --> 00:58:22.990
If I have an abstract high level thought and kind of seeing,

1015
00:58:23.290 --> 00:58:26.680
grasping all the internal structure,
that's a bit of a fiction.

1016
00:58:28.690 --> 00:58:31.960
We are out of time.
I'm just passionately,
so thank you again.

1017
00:58:32.990 --> 00:58:37.970
