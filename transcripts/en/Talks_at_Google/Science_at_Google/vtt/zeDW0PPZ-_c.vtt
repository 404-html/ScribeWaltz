00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:09.900
All right.
Hello everybody.

2
00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.920
Thanks for being here today and welcome to everybody who's watching on the live

3
00:00:13.921 --> 00:00:15.960
stream from our other offices.
Um,

4
00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.160
my name's Alex Id and we're really excited today to welcome Alexander Rose to

5
00:00:20.161 --> 00:00:20.800
Google.

6
00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.900
I'm Alexandra is the executive director of the long now foundation based right

7
00:00:24.901 --> 00:00:25.770
here in San Francisco.

8
00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.460
And some of you may be familiar with their work around the Rosetta Project,

9
00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:31.710
long bets initiative,
some other things,

10
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:35.520
but surely they're best known for the 10,000 year clock,
uh,

11
00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.030
which is a project that Alexander's been working on for the last couple of

12
00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.570
decades.
So very excited to have him here to talk about that.

13
00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:45.990
And without further ado,
I'll let him take it away.
Thank you.

14
00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.823
<v 0>Hello.</v>

15
00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:53.213
<v 2>The,</v>

16
00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.840
<v 1>this project really started with a story and it was,
um,</v>

17
00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:03.670
it was started by a group of people,
um,

18
00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:07.870
who were largely part of the first wave of Silicon Valley people,
uh,

19
00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:12.440
like Stewart brand and Esther Dyson.
And,
uh,

20
00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.250
there was the story about these beams at the new college,
Oxford.

21
00:01:16.251 --> 00:01:20.060
And there's these beams that went over the main,
uh,
the main dining hall.

22
00:01:20.061 --> 00:01:23.990
And they were,
when this was college was built,
it was in the 12 hundreds.

23
00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:28.640
It was the new college of,
of the day.
Um,
and it was these huge oak beams.

24
00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.420
But 500 years later,
uh,
in the 18 hundreds,

25
00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:34.970
these had become rotted and infested with beetles.

26
00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:39.560
And the problem was you couldn't really just by timber like this in Europe

27
00:01:39.561 --> 00:01:41.360
anymore,
mostly been harvested.

28
00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:46.400
And it wasn't until they spoke to the school forester who said,
oh,

29
00:01:46.401 --> 00:01:48.110
we have the grove of books that you planted.

30
00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:53.350
It turned out that they had the practice of the time was you planted groves to

31
00:01:53.991 --> 00:01:58.340
be harvested hundreds of years later to replace these kind of beams.
Uh,

32
00:01:58.341 --> 00:02:03.341
and so it was this simple story that when Stewart brand who had founded the

33
00:02:04.011 --> 00:02:06.650
whole earth catalog,
uh,
told it to Danny Hillis,

34
00:02:06.651 --> 00:02:10.190
who had been designing some of the fastest supercomputers computers during the

35
00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:14.290
80s with think his company thinking machines that have MIT were Denny realized

36
00:02:14.291 --> 00:02:16.520
that,
you know,
we aren't really thinking like this anymore.

37
00:02:16.521 --> 00:02:20.090
We aren't using these simple leverages over very long periods of time.

38
00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:23.520
And in fact,
by not thinking over these kinds of timescales,

39
00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.670
there's some problems that we've taken totally off the table.

40
00:02:25.671 --> 00:02:28.190
So you could imagine,
you know,
climate change is somebody said,

41
00:02:28.191 --> 00:02:31.160
you need to solve it in four years.
You're like,
I can't do that.

42
00:02:31.161 --> 00:02:35.300
But if someone said 400 years,
you can imagine how you might start that project.

43
00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:36.261
And we basically,

44
00:02:36.261 --> 00:02:39.950
by not giving ourselves these kind of timeframes to work on things,

45
00:02:39.951 --> 00:02:43.340
we're basically just taken these,
these types of problems off the table.

46
00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:46.160
And so the idea was to,
uh,

47
00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:49.730
to create a kind of an example of longterm thinking.

48
00:02:49.731 --> 00:02:53.120
And as I mentioned with Danny Hillis,
uh,
was,

49
00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.390
was inspired very early on and he had been building a very,

50
00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:00.160
very fast computers and he had this idea of building not the fastest computer,

51
00:03:00.161 --> 00:03:03.640
but actually the slowest computer in the world,
uh,
computer effectively.

52
00:03:03.641 --> 00:03:07.600
That was a clock that was calculating the heavens and the,

53
00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:10.390
and the date over 10,000 years,

54
00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:15.340
this kind of timeframe of human civilization and steward who had been talking

55
00:03:15.341 --> 00:03:18.490
with them about this,
he had started the whole earth catalog as I mentioned.

56
00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:19.940
And you thought,
well,
that's,

57
00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:23.950
that's great if we get people's attention around a longterm thinking,

58
00:03:23.951 --> 00:03:27.220
this kind of monuments scale,
all mechanical thing that,

59
00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:30.610
that gets people talking in a different way about longterm projects.

60
00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.800
But what do we do with that?

61
00:03:32.801 --> 00:03:36.010
And he wanted to create a kind of a library of information service that would

62
00:03:36.011 --> 00:03:39.990
last over the same kind of timescale.
And then Brian,
you know,
who,
uh,

63
00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:43.630
was one of the other people that started to be pulled into this conversation,

64
00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:48.720
a musician and artist.
He had this idea of the long now,
which,
uh,

65
00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:50.260
when he,
uh,

66
00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:54.610
he had grown up in England and when he first moved to New York in the 70s,

67
00:03:55.570 --> 00:04:00.130
he went to a friend's house and,
uh,
and it was in a really horrible neighborhood.

68
00:04:00.131 --> 00:04:02.320
He was like stepping over homeless people to get into it.

69
00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:06.940
And when he asked if she liked living there,
she said,
yes,
I love it here.

70
00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:12.450
And he realized that the here for her was right between those walls and in New

71
00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:12.791
York.

72
00:04:12.791 --> 00:04:16.240
They also meant when they said now they meant the kind of five minutes that they

73
00:04:16.241 --> 00:04:19.180
were in,
not the larger time that they were in.

74
00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:23.800
And so he kind of started contrasting the long now and the big here with what

75
00:04:23.801 --> 00:04:27.040
people were understanding in New York versus Europe.
Um,

76
00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:31.570
and so we kind of used that term to really stretch it out as to the larger human

77
00:04:31.571 --> 00:04:35.120
moment.
And then this other set of people who,
uh,
as I mentioned earlier,

78
00:04:35.121 --> 00:04:38.650
we're very much part of the early a wave here in silicon valley.

79
00:04:38.651 --> 00:04:43.090
And I think they were really seeing some of the speeding up of culture that

80
00:04:43.091 --> 00:04:47.950
we're definitely now deep,
you know,
kind of hip deepen now,
uh,
back then.
And they,

81
00:04:47.951 --> 00:04:48.520
they were,

82
00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:51.670
they were realizing that there needed to be some kind of counteractive to that.

83
00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:55.990
And that was why they all got together and started the long now foundation.

84
00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:00.940
And I was hired,
uh,
in the,
uh,

85
00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:02.740
late nineties,

86
00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:08.700
mid 1997 to start working with Danny Hillis on building this clock.

87
00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:13.360
And I'm going to talk about some of the lessons that we've learned about how to

88
00:05:13.361 --> 00:05:17.380
build things over that can last over a thousand years and a,

89
00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:19.000
some of the lessons we have from antiquity.

90
00:05:19.001 --> 00:05:22.600
And then I'm also going to dive into some of the,

91
00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:25.240
the exact details of the project right now.
And in fact,

92
00:05:25.241 --> 00:05:28.000
some of the pictures that had been taken from the site,

93
00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:32.260
that's where we're building the monument scale version in west Texas.
Uh,

94
00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:36.430
we'll be,
um,
that I just took a few weeks ago were like,

95
00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:41.440
so this idea of 10,000 years,
um,
really came first from this,
uh,

96
00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:44.080
conversation about,
you know,
what is,

97
00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:46.510
what is the right timescale for us to be working in?

98
00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:50.410
And if you want to stretch people's imagination around time,

99
00:05:50.411 --> 00:05:53.680
but if you start working with the kind of galactic timescale,

100
00:05:53.681 --> 00:05:54.910
these kind of billions of years,

101
00:05:54.911 --> 00:05:58.700
the whole human experience becomes totally dwarfed.
So that's not what we wanted.

102
00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:02.920
And even if you start looking at millions of years on this geologic timescale,

103
00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:04.550
it's still a dwarfing experience.

104
00:06:04.551 --> 00:06:06.680
It's very difficult to feel as though you have an effect in it.

105
00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:13.090
But this idea of the last and the next 10,000 years where it's kind of the last

106
00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:18.230
ice age retreated,
we had,
uh,
some of the first,
uh,
agriculture and cities,

107
00:06:18.231 --> 00:06:21.470
this,
this was really what we wanted to capture as the human moment.

108
00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:24.770
And I think the most important part of this is,

109
00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:29.860
is not really thinking about ourselves as the kind of end of a 10,000 year story

110
00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:34.220
but more in the middle of at least a 20,000 year story of modern humanity.

111
00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:37.280
And if you start thinking about yourself that way and the projects that you're

112
00:06:37.281 --> 00:06:39.740
working on,
uh,
how would you act differently?

113
00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:44.060
And one of the very first kind of diagrams that we,

114
00:06:44.061 --> 00:06:45.670
that came out of a conversation,
uh,

115
00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:49.310
with Brian Eno and Stewart brand was this one of this kind of layers of human

116
00:06:49.311 --> 00:06:49.641
time,

117
00:06:49.641 --> 00:06:54.641
this pace layering where you have the fastest time and most chaotic elements out

118
00:06:55.971 --> 00:06:57.310
here.
And I would even put some of the,
you know,

119
00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:01.080
modern communication technology is up here on this kind of fashion layer now.
Um,

120
00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:03.770
and then it goes down into commerce and infrastructure and governance,

121
00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:07.970
culture and nature moving the absolute slowest.
And the idea was like,
you know,

122
00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:10.970
how do we know when people are,
are,
are not acting in a,

123
00:07:10.971 --> 00:07:14.480
in a good way around longterm thinking.
And you can imagine,
you know,
when,

124
00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:19.540
when Pacific lumber got bought out by Maxim Corporation and they owned the

125
00:07:19.881 --> 00:07:23.450
largest swats of,
of,
of old growth redwoods and the Pacific northwest,

126
00:07:23.451 --> 00:07:26.450
this was all done in this commercial layer and maximum corporations,

127
00:07:26.451 --> 00:07:29.360
their main goal with all companies was to buy them and sell them for their

128
00:07:29.361 --> 00:07:33.170
assets.
And that's one thing when that's the assets are some buildings and some

129
00:07:33.171 --> 00:07:37.280
machinery.
But in this case,
specific lumber assets were old growth redwoods,

130
00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:38.690
which are down here.

131
00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:43.610
And they basically skipped all this and we're trying to sell off these millions

132
00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:46.880
of dollars of assets in a single generation where they couldn't be replaced.

133
00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:50.530
And then I'll,
you know,
all kind of hell broke loose politically and,
and that,

134
00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:51.710
you know,
they partially,

135
00:07:51.711 --> 00:07:54.200
we're able to sell them off when they partially ended up getting saved and

136
00:07:54.201 --> 00:07:55.940
bought up by,
by other interests.

137
00:07:55.941 --> 00:07:59.720
But it's these kinds of moments where you skip a bunch of these layers that you

138
00:07:59.721 --> 00:08:02.360
realize you're,
you're probably not doing longterm thinking.
Right.

139
00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:09.470
And so
I'm going to talk,
as I mentioned,
uh,

140
00:08:09.471 --> 00:08:12.020
about some of the things that have lasted in antiquity,
some,

141
00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:14.570
some of the reasons why they have lasted.
Um,

142
00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:19.220
but you'll kind of see an a along with that last example that I gave is that for

143
00:08:19.221 --> 00:08:24.050
the most part,
one of the things that we have really realized about,

144
00:08:24.290 --> 00:08:25.123
um,

145
00:08:25.550 --> 00:08:30.440
trying to think about the future in a positive way is that when you're making

146
00:08:30.441 --> 00:08:35.150
decisions that give the future more options,
you're probably doing it right.

147
00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:39.150
You know,
the future will always have more information than we have.
Um,

148
00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:42.170
and we will always have less information in the future,

149
00:08:42.171 --> 00:08:45.350
has so many choices now are often made.
You know,

150
00:08:45.351 --> 00:08:47.570
if you look at let's say something like the,
uh,

151
00:08:47.610 --> 00:08:52.340
the bill of rights where it's 10 things about a sentence and a half each,

152
00:08:52.370 --> 00:08:57.370
they were all very principle based notions that are intended to be reinterpreted

153
00:08:57.391 --> 00:09:02.100
every single generation.
Whereas a modern law is 1200 pages long.

154
00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:03.630
No one's ever actually read it all.

155
00:09:03.870 --> 00:09:08.460
But it's very much intended to have no room for different interpretation by the

156
00:09:08.461 --> 00:09:09.990
future.
Um,

157
00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:14.160
and you can see which ones of those seem to have better sticking power,
um,

158
00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:18.000
the bill of rights or some of these modern laws that,
that really don't even,
uh,

159
00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:21.270
a lot of people don't even know what's in all of them.
Um,

160
00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:25.290
so I'm gonna move over to the kind of mechanical side of what I do.

161
00:09:25.291 --> 00:09:29.370
My background is in industrial design and as we have been designing this clock,

162
00:09:29.371 --> 00:09:31.790
I've been collecting various examples of,

163
00:09:32.110 --> 00:09:34.500
of ways that things have lasted.

164
00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:38.710
And one of the most amazing examples is this one,
which is the,

165
00:09:38.711 --> 00:09:40.340
and ticket their device,
which was,
uh,

166
00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:45.620
a very small piece of a kind of corroded bronze that was found off the coast of

167
00:09:46.981 --> 00:09:48.240
Antarctica,
Thera Greece.

168
00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:53.610
And for a long time people realize it was special that it had gearing and,

169
00:09:53.730 --> 00:09:57.810
and these markings,
but it wasn't until they started doing x-rays and,
uh,

170
00:09:57.850 --> 00:10:01.440
other types of scans and then we're able to reconstruct it that they realize

171
00:10:01.441 --> 00:10:05.220
there's actually an astronomical clock.
It was,
it set back the date of,

172
00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:10.020
of a lot of gearing and astronomical knowledge,
uh,
by almost 1500 years.

173
00:10:10.021 --> 00:10:13.050
Once it was really understood what it was,
it's pretty amazing in that sense.

174
00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:15.600
And no one's ever found anything quite like it.

175
00:10:16.230 --> 00:10:20.490
But the really interesting thing to me is that,
um,
because it was mechanical,

176
00:10:20.491 --> 00:10:24.650
if this was let's say an electronic clock that had been on the sea floor for

177
00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:29.480
2000 years,
um,
it would not have been,
uh,
there's,

178
00:10:29.481 --> 00:10:31.980
it would be no way to reconstruct it.
So you know,
why is,

179
00:10:32.130 --> 00:10:35.670
why is the clock that we're building electronic or mechanical instead of

180
00:10:35.671 --> 00:10:37.230
electronic?
It's because it gets,

181
00:10:37.231 --> 00:10:40.680
it has this kind of self documenting feature even with,
uh,
you know,

182
00:10:40.681 --> 00:10:43.110
something is corroded as some of those pieces I showed you,

183
00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:44.490
they were still able to figure it out.

184
00:10:45.390 --> 00:10:49.590
So you want to be able to design something not only to work,
uh,
in,
in,

185
00:10:50.330 --> 00:10:52.560
you know,
it's kind of designed operation state,

186
00:10:52.561 --> 00:10:55.800
but also in it's failing operation state so that people can reconstruct it.

187
00:10:57.570 --> 00:11:01.430
Another interesting thing that happens is this idea of sacrifice.
And we,
we,

188
00:11:01.790 --> 00:11:05.970
we often see this in nature was something like a lizard that can lose its tail

189
00:11:05.971 --> 00:11:09.270
and still go on to live.
But in antiquity,

190
00:11:09.271 --> 00:11:12.690
we also see it where something like the Pyramids,
uh,
you know,
they,

191
00:11:12.870 --> 00:11:17.040
the tombs were lost.
The outer casing stones were eventually stripped off.

192
00:11:17.670 --> 00:11:19.230
But if the intent of the,

193
00:11:19.290 --> 00:11:23.880
of the original builders was to keep pyramids around for 5,000 years there that

194
00:11:23.881 --> 00:11:25.530
would have this,
this would've worked.

195
00:11:25.530 --> 00:11:29.730
And when people took off of these outer outer parts and stole the value from the

196
00:11:29.731 --> 00:11:33.240
inside,
they kind of felt as though they'd extracted all the value from this.
Um,

197
00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:37.280
and for probably the builders they did.
But if we imagine that the ability,

198
00:11:37.281 --> 00:11:41.930
his intent was just to keep pyramids around for 5,000 years,
then that,

199
00:11:41.931 --> 00:11:42.930
that would have been success.

200
00:11:42.931 --> 00:11:46.670
And you also see this in something like the Taj Mahal where,
uh,

201
00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:50.220
the whole insides of it work in crusted with all kinds of jewels.

202
00:11:50.550 --> 00:11:53.650
And when it was finally sacked by the British for the time,

203
00:11:53.830 --> 00:11:58.090
they spent a long time prying all these jewels out of the walls and we still

204
00:11:58.091 --> 00:12:02.230
have this amazing architectural artifact that wasn't destroyed because they felt

205
00:12:02.231 --> 00:12:05.770
as though they had extracted the value with that they felt was just the gems.

206
00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:11.150
The other strategy is to make something remote.
And this,

207
00:12:11.151 --> 00:12:16.120
this kind of has two elements to it.
One is that there's also a kind of a,

208
00:12:17.270 --> 00:12:20.600
a mystery that people are getting intrigued by when things are remote.

209
00:12:20.601 --> 00:12:23.420
This is a picture of the seed vault in Svalbard.
Uh,

210
00:12:23.421 --> 00:12:25.800
I was there a few winters ago.
Uh,

211
00:12:25.970 --> 00:12:29.740
this is what it looks like when you're flying into the airport there.
That's the,

212
00:12:30.170 --> 00:12:34.070
the airstrip and it's,
it's extremely remote.
It's the most northern,

213
00:12:34.430 --> 00:12:37.640
most permanently uninhabited place on the planet.
Uh,

214
00:12:37.641 --> 00:12:42.641
and the seed vault is meant to store a copy of crop seeds from seed banks from

215
00:12:43.341 --> 00:12:45.140
around the world,
uh,
which it does.

216
00:12:45.141 --> 00:12:47.450
And what was amazing to me after traveling all the way,

217
00:12:47.451 --> 00:12:49.430
there was this signing into this guest book.

218
00:12:49.650 --> 00:12:54.200
I was signing him behind banky moon and Jimmy Carter.
And in people,

219
00:12:54.230 --> 00:12:56.210
there's something about these remote sites that,

220
00:12:56.510 --> 00:13:00.650
that people really find a really compelling and kind of becomes part of this

221
00:13:00.651 --> 00:13:05.180
myth in our case,
hopefully of longterm thinking that we want to promote.

222
00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:10.470
The other interesting tactic is to just take a really long time building

223
00:13:10.471 --> 00:13:13.900
something.
Um,
the,
the cathedrals of Europe are,
uh,

224
00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:19.080
are definitely in this van.
So this is the cathedral at Cologne.
It was,
uh,

225
00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:22.620
it took 600 years to build a start in the 12 hundreds and finished in the,

226
00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:27.760
in the 18 hundreds,
and it's actually still kind of under construction.
Um,

227
00:13:27.870 --> 00:13:31.360
but it helps pass this,
uh,
this point.
And,
and,

228
00:13:31.430 --> 00:13:35.280
and another cathedral that's a great example is La Familia.
And,

229
00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:40.740
uh,
in Barcelona,
the Sagrada Familia,
I'm sorry.
Um,

230
00:13:40.860 --> 00:13:45.450
and it,
you know,
it was,
it's now on its fourth or fifth architect,
most famous,

231
00:13:45.451 --> 00:13:48.060
one being Goudy.
It's 125 years into building.

232
00:13:48.061 --> 00:13:50.310
It probably has another hundred and 25 years ago,

233
00:13:50.670 --> 00:13:52.920
but it's already a UNESCO world heritage site,

234
00:13:52.950 --> 00:13:55.530
even though it's a construction site.
Uh,
so it's,

235
00:13:55.531 --> 00:13:59.370
it's kind of passed this very critical time that all of these things do.

236
00:13:59.371 --> 00:14:02.730
And we didn't even see it here in San Francisco of look kind of one generation

237
00:14:02.731 --> 00:14:06.390
after some things built as the most dangerous time for anything to last because

238
00:14:06.391 --> 00:14:09.500
it's kind of your parents thing.
It's not cool anymore.
Uh,

239
00:14:09.690 --> 00:14:13.740
but once it passes that generation and then it's kind of this antique and then

240
00:14:13.741 --> 00:14:16.850
people want to keep it.
And so grad familiar went through this very much.

241
00:14:16.860 --> 00:14:21.090
It was an unworked on for a whole generation until somebody else picked it back

242
00:14:21.091 --> 00:14:21.924
up again.

243
00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:23.093
<v 3>Okay.</v>

244
00:14:25.220 --> 00:14:29.600
<v 1>And
in Japan we see another strategy,</v>

245
00:14:29.601 --> 00:14:32.590
which is that they're just really good at maintaining things.
So,

246
00:14:32.591 --> 00:14:35.250
so these are two of the oldest continuously standing,
uh,

247
00:14:35.300 --> 00:14:37.840
wooden structures in the world.
Um,

248
00:14:37.910 --> 00:14:41.820
and they've just been meticulously maintained in a very wet environment.
Uh,

249
00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:45.440
but they're kept the roof on.
They've replaced things as they've gotten rotten.

250
00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:49.640
Um,
but there are over 1400 years old and they're made of wood.

251
00:14:49.850 --> 00:14:54.800
So even some of the most materials can last for thousands of years if,
uh,

252
00:14:54.890 --> 00:14:59.260
if done right.
In fact,
there's a even more ephemeral material,
uh,
temple site,

253
00:14:59.270 --> 00:15:00.320
that Shinto shrine that's,

254
00:15:00.350 --> 00:15:05.350
that's close to this one where they rebuild the site every 20 years in an exact

255
00:15:05.871 --> 00:15:10.280
replica and they've been doing that for over 1600 years and that's just that and

256
00:15:10.281 --> 00:15:14.980
would so it's a,
it's another way of this kind of renewal of a,
of a design.

257
00:15:14.990 --> 00:15:19.970
It also keeps once a generation people actually teach the master of teaching and

258
00:15:19.971 --> 00:15:23.990
apprentice and going on a generation after generation.

259
00:15:26.090 --> 00:15:30.950
And um,
another interesting problem that I've noticed is,
is that,

260
00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:33.530
you know,
as,
as you look around the world,

261
00:15:33.531 --> 00:15:37.040
most things that are designed to last for several thousand years are being put

262
00:15:37.060 --> 00:15:41.720
underground.
But one of the big problems that happens there is that,

263
00:15:41.810 --> 00:15:45.560
uh,
that people always think they can keep the water out.
Uh,

264
00:15:45.561 --> 00:15:49.090
what I've learned is that you can divert water.
You can't stop water.
Um,

265
00:15:49.250 --> 00:15:51.640
so you can choose where water wants to go.
Ah,

266
00:15:51.710 --> 00:15:54.620
this was the last picture they let me take before going into the Mormon

267
00:15:54.650 --> 00:15:57.640
genealogical archives outside of Salt Lake City.
Um,

268
00:15:57.650 --> 00:16:01.260
I did find some pictures from inside there.
Amazingly,
but the Mormon,
uh,

269
00:16:01.490 --> 00:16:04.180
archives with the built in this bunker,
um,

270
00:16:04.490 --> 00:16:07.970
and the goal was to keep the water out.
And,
uh,

271
00:16:07.971 --> 00:16:12.230
the all of those,
all of those drawers that were in that last slide,

272
00:16:12.590 --> 00:16:13.880
the whole,
all the bottom ones,

273
00:16:13.881 --> 00:16:17.870
they don't keep filled because it's already flooded like five times in the 40

274
00:16:17.871 --> 00:16:22.640
years it's been around.
Um,
and the,
uh,

275
00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:25.670
they,
they,
they basically can't keep the water out.

276
00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:30.260
So all they do is they've dug trenches under the vault doors to let the water

277
00:16:30.261 --> 00:16:34.760
through the site.
And this is actually a picture of the pumps at the,

278
00:16:34.790 --> 00:16:38.930
that they had to install at the seed vault in Svalbard.
And,
uh,

279
00:16:38.931 --> 00:16:42.380
the other underground sites like the nuclear waste sites,
um,

280
00:16:42.890 --> 00:16:45.530
are also already having these problems even before nuclear wastes,

281
00:16:45.531 --> 00:16:47.820
it gets put in them.
So it's a,
it's,

282
00:16:47.850 --> 00:16:50.600
it's an interesting thing that many of these sites have chosen to be
underground,

283
00:16:50.601 --> 00:16:54.170
but they have a,
unfortunately thought that they can stop the water.

284
00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:57.620
And the last one that I'll mention is this idea of ideology.

285
00:16:57.621 --> 00:17:02.000
This is a picture before and after pictures of the Buddha's at Balmy on in

286
00:17:02.001 --> 00:17:06.410
Afghanistan.
This is a person to give you an idea of scale there.
They're massive.

287
00:17:06.710 --> 00:17:09.890
But the Taliban spent,
uh,
weeks,
uh,

288
00:17:10.190 --> 00:17:13.910
dynamiting those Buddhas out of that cliff face,
um,

289
00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:18.770
for an ideology as kind of innocuous as Buddhism.
That's pretty impressive.
And,

290
00:17:18.771 --> 00:17:23.580
and you know,
lung now does have an audiologist ideology of longterm thinking.
Um,

291
00:17:23.590 --> 00:17:24.770
and I think this is one of the most,

292
00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:27.800
the largest dangers and trying to create something that's gonna last for a very

293
00:17:27.801 --> 00:17:28.920
long time is,
uh,

294
00:17:29.100 --> 00:17:33.380
you never know who's going to choose to take that on as a,
uh,

295
00:17:33.710 --> 00:17:38.300
as an enemy.
Uh,
as I mentioned before,
I get into the clock.

296
00:17:39.020 --> 00:17:42.560
Stewart brand had talked about,
uh,

297
00:17:42.620 --> 00:17:45.860
this idea of a very longterm library and,
um,

298
00:17:45.970 --> 00:17:49.890
and Alex mentioned our Rosetta Project,
so I just did just want to touch on it.

299
00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:52.440
Uh,
early on in,
in this,

300
00:17:52.441 --> 00:17:56.430
we realized we needed something that could also record culture over the kind of

301
00:17:56.431 --> 00:18:00.090
timescale that we're talking about.
Not just inspire people to think long term.

302
00:18:00.091 --> 00:18:03.150
And we looked at this,
you know,
the Rosetta stone itself,

303
00:18:03.151 --> 00:18:06.120
which had a two languages and three different scripts.

304
00:18:06.121 --> 00:18:10.800
And it was kind of the key to deciphering hieroglyphics.
But that even with that,

305
00:18:10.801 --> 00:18:14.310
it took 50 years of,
of effort to decode hieroglyphics.

306
00:18:14.670 --> 00:18:19.670
That's also another good example of how pretty much how bad really a

307
00:18:20.190 --> 00:18:22.800
pictographic languages are.
And we often think like,
oh,

308
00:18:22.801 --> 00:18:24.060
if you're going to want to last something,

309
00:18:24.180 --> 00:18:25.560
if you want something to last for a really long time,

310
00:18:25.561 --> 00:18:27.130
just draw pictures and everyone to understand.

311
00:18:27.180 --> 00:18:29.940
But it turns out pictures are super ladened with culture.

312
00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:31.890
They're the most difficult things to understand.

313
00:18:31.891 --> 00:18:36.891
It's way easier to decode something like an alphabet that's phonetic like ours.

314
00:18:38.430 --> 00:18:42.780
And so we thought we wanted to make a modern version of this.
And so what we did,

315
00:18:42.781 --> 00:18:45.120
we spent about a decade collecting,
uh,

316
00:18:45.210 --> 00:18:49.680
parallel languages and 10 different elements of languages.
The parallel text,

317
00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:50.360
uh,

318
00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:54.930
a map of where it's found a basic description of it and then instead of etching

319
00:18:54.931 --> 00:18:58.830
it into stone,
we could take these thousands of pages and use a galley.

320
00:18:58.840 --> 00:19:03.030
My on being the same technology that's used for micro circuits and just write

321
00:19:03.031 --> 00:19:07.890
the actual text into silicon and then plate on top of that,
uh,

322
00:19:07.891 --> 00:19:10.620
metals that can last for a long time,
like nickel or Rhodium.

323
00:19:11.070 --> 00:19:15.660
And so we put a 13 and a half thousand pages of language documentation on this

324
00:19:15.661 --> 00:19:16.460
disk,
uh,

325
00:19:16.460 --> 00:19:19.710
one of which was launched on the European Space Agency's Rosetta mission.

326
00:19:20.370 --> 00:19:23.130
If you remember,
just a few years ago,
uh,

327
00:19:23.190 --> 00:19:26.820
the spacecraft landed on this comment.

328
00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:30.550
And so it's now our piece of,
uh,

329
00:19:30.630 --> 00:19:34.470
language documentation that's going to continue to orbit the sun in perpetuity.

330
00:19:36.690 --> 00:19:38.750
So the clock,
this is the project that,
uh,

331
00:19:38.751 --> 00:19:42.540
I have been working on for 21 plus years now.

332
00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:47.530
We started with a prototype that we finished it in 1999,
uh,

333
00:19:47.550 --> 00:19:52.260
that one's now at the Science Museum in London.
And then in 2005,

334
00:19:52.261 --> 00:19:53.160
Jeff Bezos,

335
00:19:53.700 --> 00:19:57.360
founder of Amazon came on to fund the full scale version that we're,

336
00:19:57.390 --> 00:19:59.880
that we're now building.
And,
uh,

337
00:19:59.881 --> 00:20:03.780
so I'm going to talk about just kind of a couple of the design problems that

338
00:20:03.781 --> 00:20:06.450
we've solved in working on the clock.
And,
uh,

339
00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:10.830
this is a picture of the sun at noon throughout the course of the year.

340
00:20:10.831 --> 00:20:15.360
This is what's called the Anna Lemma.
And this is a,

341
00:20:15.361 --> 00:20:18.360
it's a summer solstice is the top when you're still at the bottom,
the equinox.

342
00:20:18.780 --> 00:20:21.240
And the reason I'm showing this is that the clock that we wanted to build,

343
00:20:21.241 --> 00:20:23.550
we wanted to have a way for it to not drift.

344
00:20:23.980 --> 00:20:27.060
It's timing over the course of 10,000 years.

345
00:20:27.061 --> 00:20:30.900
So we wanted a way to synchronize it and candidly to the sun on a nice sunny
day.

346
00:20:31.290 --> 00:20:34.650
But we also wanted it to be able to keep time between those sunny days with a

347
00:20:34.651 --> 00:20:37.200
pendulum that's keeping what's called absolute time.

348
00:20:37.710 --> 00:20:42.710
So the difference between solar time and absolute time is this kind of plus or

349
00:20:42.931 --> 00:20:44.730
minus 15 minute difference here.

350
00:20:45.300 --> 00:20:47.200
And then it varies throughout the course of the year.

351
00:20:48.310 --> 00:20:52.630
So normally if you wanted to have a pendulum keeping absolute time synchronizing

352
00:20:52.631 --> 00:20:55.420
to the son,
all you'd have to do is make it a cam.

353
00:20:55.421 --> 00:20:57.640
That kind of corrects for this one and dilemma.

354
00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:00.310
But the problem is if you're trying to build a 10,000 year clock,

355
00:21:00.340 --> 00:21:05.140
the earth is also processing on its poles every 26,000 years and it's slowing.

356
00:21:05.141 --> 00:21:07.720
It's rotational rate by about a second century.

357
00:21:08.890 --> 00:21:12.940
So all of that had to go into a shape that is,

358
00:21:12.970 --> 00:21:14.770
that turns around once per year,

359
00:21:15.190 --> 00:21:20.190
but as read over the course of over 10,000 years to give us that plus or minus

360
00:21:21.491 --> 00:21:25.720
15 minutes difference as it evolves for 10,000 years.
So this is kind of a,

361
00:21:25.721 --> 00:21:30.010
this one shape is that equation of time as it changes.
Uh,
we left,

362
00:21:30.011 --> 00:21:31.470
we've made this a 12,000 year camps.

363
00:21:31.490 --> 00:21:34.330
You had a thousand years in the beginning of a thousand years in the end to make

364
00:21:34.331 --> 00:21:38.940
a new camp.
The,
uh,

365
00:21:39.030 --> 00:21:42.270
the site that we're building at now,
uh,
is in west Texas.

366
00:21:42.271 --> 00:21:47.130
The very first site that we actually purchased a site in eastern Nevada.
Uh,

367
00:21:47.131 --> 00:21:51.540
that was in the great basin national park that's covered in some of the oldest

368
00:21:51.541 --> 00:21:53.670
trees in the world.
Bristle cones,
which was an amazing sight,

369
00:21:53.671 --> 00:21:57.640
but also became very difficult.
Permitting was,
and,
uh,
Jeff Bezos,

370
00:21:57.641 --> 00:22:00.250
when he came on with the funding for this project,
uh,

371
00:22:00.300 --> 00:22:04.050
he was also buying some of these ranch properties in west Texas for his blue

372
00:22:04.051 --> 00:22:06.480
origin launch facility.
And,
uh,

373
00:22:06.570 --> 00:22:09.330
we found this amazing site that's karst limestone,

374
00:22:09.331 --> 00:22:11.880
something that we can carve and underground.
Um,

375
00:22:11.940 --> 00:22:13.650
it's also very close to Carlsbad caverns.

376
00:22:13.651 --> 00:22:17.640
We knew that it could support underground structures and that case for 60

377
00:22:17.640 --> 00:22:19.620
million years.
Uh,
and so in our case,

378
00:22:19.621 --> 00:22:24.621
we just needed the 10,000 and in 2010 we started

379
00:22:27.630 --> 00:22:31.950
the underground work.
So we were going to,
the goal was to build,
uh,

380
00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:35.640
an underground structure that started,

381
00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:38.350
<v 3>oh,
sorry,</v>

382
00:22:40.990 --> 00:22:44.950
<v 1>that started looking like this kind of rough old mining entrance.</v>

383
00:22:45.490 --> 00:22:47.560
And then,
uh,

384
00:22:48.490 --> 00:22:52.240
as you move through it by the end and seeing the whole clock,

385
00:22:52.570 --> 00:22:57.340
it would then look like this,
uh,
very,

386
00:22:57.370 --> 00:23:00.980
uh,
very manmade.
Uh,
totally,
uh,

387
00:23:01.030 --> 00:23:05.860
smooth hewn project.
And as a,

388
00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:08.670
as you saw before,
you know,
there's,
there's one type of,

389
00:23:08.671 --> 00:23:11.260
of underground work that's the kind of the earliest way,

390
00:23:11.261 --> 00:23:14.950
which is using explosives to um,
to work.
And that's,

391
00:23:14.951 --> 00:23:16.270
that makes it very rough surfaces.

392
00:23:16.271 --> 00:23:17.980
So that worked for the beginning of our project,

393
00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:21.520
but then we have this design where we wanted to have this kind of like forced

394
00:23:21.521 --> 00:23:23.620
perspective,
spiral staircase,

395
00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:27.760
underground space where we're working basically carving very smooth surfaces

396
00:23:27.761 --> 00:23:32.260
underground.
Uh,
and we found in Carrara,
Italy,
they do this but just to do,

397
00:23:32.300 --> 00:23:35.440
to work effectively in the positive,
just to cut big blocks of,

398
00:23:35.880 --> 00:23:37.810
of stone out from under the ground.

399
00:23:38.410 --> 00:23:43.300
And so we borrowed one of the s these nine foot diamond chainsaws from them and

400
00:23:43.301 --> 00:23:46.490
we built a 36,000 pound diamond chain,
saw a robot

401
00:23:47.990 --> 00:23:50.990
that has been working well.

402
00:23:50.991 --> 00:23:55.850
Now it's done now it spent two years cutting plate by plate,

403
00:23:56.730 --> 00:23:58.310
uh,
out from underground.

404
00:23:58.311 --> 00:24:02.030
And then once you break out the plates between those cuts,

405
00:24:03.280 --> 00:24:03.780
<v 3>yeah,</v>

406
00:24:03.780 --> 00:24:07.740
<v 1>we were left with what we wanted,
which was both that kind of a hall space.</v>

407
00:24:08.310 --> 00:24:09.610
And,
um,

408
00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:15.120
350 feet vertical feet of diamond cut stairs.

409
00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:21.030
And that just finished up about a year ago.

410
00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:23.660
<v 3>Okay.</v>

411
00:24:23.660 --> 00:24:26.090
<v 1>And that's before the railing got installed.
It's gonna have a nervous time.</v>

412
00:24:26.091 --> 00:24:29.710
It's a 500 vertical foot a whole.
So,
uh,

413
00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:33.460
working there as a little bit tense.
The um,

414
00:24:33.590 --> 00:24:37.730
the other parts of the clock and we're not done with the clock.
Um,

415
00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:42.660
but a lot of it is,
is getting very close to being done.
Um,

416
00:24:42.670 --> 00:24:46.790
I'm going to show you a little bit about the chime generator and the power

417
00:24:46.791 --> 00:24:50.300
system,
the power system,
uh,
and I'll be able to show you some images.

418
00:24:50.330 --> 00:24:54.680
In fact of the power system which we just installed on site in West Texas.

419
00:24:55.070 --> 00:24:59.530
The uh,
the chime generator that we built,
uh,

420
00:24:59.540 --> 00:25:03.950
this was the very first prototype of it where it can ring a series of 10 bells

421
00:25:04.010 --> 00:25:06.560
in a different sequence each day for 10,000 years.

422
00:25:06.561 --> 00:25:10.550
So when I mentioned that Danny wanted to build effectively the slowest computer

423
00:25:10.551 --> 00:25:13.670
in the world,
this is kind of one of those,
it's a,

424
00:25:14.180 --> 00:25:17.990
it can do 10 factorial,
which if you do that math,

425
00:25:17.991 --> 00:25:22.991
it does come out about 70,000 days short of a once per day for the entire 10,000

426
00:25:24.891 --> 00:25:25.710
years.
But the bell,

427
00:25:25.710 --> 00:25:28.460
the bell is only ring on the days that people are there to wind the clock.

428
00:25:28.461 --> 00:25:31.340
So we assume there'll be a few miss days.
Um,

429
00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:34.160
but then we needed to scale that design up to this kind of thing that's in the

430
00:25:34.161 --> 00:25:36.350
spiral staircase that,
uh,

431
00:25:36.351 --> 00:25:39.560
that people would experience on this kind of architectural scale.

432
00:25:40.490 --> 00:25:42.290
And that's what we've been building,
uh,

433
00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:47.150
largely out of parts that are machined up in Seattle.
But then this is our shop,

434
00:25:47.170 --> 00:25:50.820
uh,
right up here in San Rafael.
Each one of these,
uh,

435
00:25:50.870 --> 00:25:55.400
module layers rings a bell and there'll be bells hung between them and there's

436
00:25:55.401 --> 00:25:58.010
10 of them and it,
it'll be 80 feet tall.

437
00:25:58.011 --> 00:26:00.200
And that's the next thing that we installed at the site.

438
00:26:00.201 --> 00:26:05.201
It's a 60,000 pounds a bell ringing device that we're going to be lowering in in

439
00:26:05.211 --> 00:26:06.080
the next few months.

440
00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:11.050
And the power system was an interesting problem with the roof.

441
00:26:11.190 --> 00:26:13.010
With the first prototype of the clock that we built,

442
00:26:13.011 --> 00:26:17.200
we realized that there wasn't really a way for people to interact with the clock

443
00:26:17.201 --> 00:26:18.620
and we,
um,

444
00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:23.180
without someone being able to kind of own the moment that they have with it.

445
00:26:23.181 --> 00:26:25.490
It didn't really have the effect that we were after.

446
00:26:25.910 --> 00:26:28.730
And so we realized that we did want people to wind the clock,

447
00:26:28.731 --> 00:26:32.030
but we also didn't want it to lose time when people weren't there to wind it.

448
00:26:32.540 --> 00:26:35.300
And so what we ended up with was as a kind of a two part system where the,

449
00:26:35.460 --> 00:26:39.440
the clock is the part of the clock that keeps the time is wound by the

450
00:26:39.441 --> 00:26:40.910
temperature difference from day tonight,

451
00:26:40.940 --> 00:26:42.740
there's at the very top of this mountain,

452
00:26:42.741 --> 00:26:47.640
there's a tank of air that expands when it gets warm and a metal bellows expands

453
00:26:47.641 --> 00:26:51.460
and we get just enough energy basically to keep the pendulum ticking and to know

454
00:26:51.461 --> 00:26:53.040
where the now point is.

455
00:26:53.430 --> 00:26:56.820
But to show you that now point and for all the chimes to ring that use all the

456
00:26:56.821 --> 00:27:00.720
energy for those bells.
Uh,
we,
uh,
we require that people wind it.

457
00:27:00.721 --> 00:27:01.650
So when people come,

458
00:27:01.651 --> 00:27:04.620
they wind the clock all the way up in the rewarded with the bells ringing in the

459
00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:06.510
all the different dials updating.

460
00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:11.130
And so once you get into this kind of level of human interaction with big

461
00:27:11.280 --> 00:27:13.190
mechanical things,
um,

462
00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:17.310
we had to build some of these very large gears and also really where we're doing

463
00:27:17.311 --> 00:27:21.570
effectively experience design.
We're kind of designing a ride,
uh,
that are,

464
00:27:21.571 --> 00:27:24.570
we're trying to change the way people think from the beginning to the end of

465
00:27:24.571 --> 00:27:25.800
that ride.
Uh,

466
00:27:25.801 --> 00:27:30.180
and work with a very large machine that's effectively storing 15,000 pounds of

467
00:27:30.181 --> 00:27:33.870
weight that can fall over a hundred feet.
And one of the,

468
00:27:33.930 --> 00:27:37.970
the most difficult problems that we had early on in this project was bearings.

469
00:27:38.140 --> 00:27:40.160
Uh,
if you're trying to make,
uh,

470
00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:43.800
something that rolls over something else that lasts for thousands of years out

471
00:27:43.801 --> 00:27:48.210
of metal,
it's very,
very difficult.
Uh,
and when I started on this project,

472
00:27:48.660 --> 00:27:49.740
the,
um,

473
00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:55.080
I found the right solution and it was a bearing was developed for satellites and

474
00:27:55.081 --> 00:27:59.160
does these ceramic bearings that are kind of engineered diamond hard ceramics

475
00:27:59.250 --> 00:28:03.540
and they don't rust.
They don't weld to themselves,
they don't need lubrication.

476
00:28:03.541 --> 00:28:05.160
They're designed to work in the space,

477
00:28:05.370 --> 00:28:09.950
but they cost about $60,000 each 22 years ago.
Um,

478
00:28:09.990 --> 00:28:14.780
but now they're in fidget spinners and roller blades and the cost $5.
So,
um,

479
00:28:14.910 --> 00:28:18.420
it was one of those very happy accidents of technology that uh,

480
00:28:18.450 --> 00:28:23.100
that allows us to basically every single moving part in this clock is using

481
00:28:23.340 --> 00:28:25.410
ceramic bearings of some kind,

482
00:28:25.411 --> 00:28:29.490
either with metal races for some of the very large ones or ceramic on ceramic

483
00:28:29.491 --> 00:28:34.110
bearings.
And,
uh,
this is the power system as it was being tested,
assembled,

484
00:28:34.550 --> 00:28:35.880
uh,
at the shop.

485
00:28:35.881 --> 00:28:40.540
And this is us putting it in literally just a few weeks ago at the site.

486
00:28:59.710 --> 00:29:00.543
<v 0>Yes.</v>

487
00:29:04.350 --> 00:29:07.840
<v 4>So for each one of these builds,
we have to build a temporary work deck,</v>

488
00:29:07.841 --> 00:29:11.410
which we're working on there.
It's 150 foot fall from where we're working.

489
00:29:11.411 --> 00:29:11.891
Otherwise.

490
00:29:11.891 --> 00:29:16.660
But even so we're all working on tethers and everything comes from the surface,

491
00:29:17.110 --> 00:29:18.010
partially assemble

492
00:29:22.170 --> 00:29:25.300
and in some cases is assemble with thermo fitting with towards,

493
00:29:29.140 --> 00:29:32.140
that's the temporary deck getting installed for the next level.

494
00:29:35.710 --> 00:29:37.670
And that's the 15,000 pound weight [inaudible]

495
00:29:37.770 --> 00:29:42.400
<v 1>that store is energy for the clock over,
uh,
over time.</v>

496
00:29:42.401 --> 00:29:47.350
And the,
um,
basically it can,
you can even run for over a century,
uh,

497
00:29:47.351 --> 00:29:50.620
without being wound by people just just from that itself.

498
00:29:52.540 --> 00:29:57.280
And this is our amazing crew of,
of engineers who've been working on this.
Um,

499
00:29:59.030 --> 00:30:02.840
so I'm just going to show you some of these last few slides of that.
I,

500
00:30:02.900 --> 00:30:07.600
that I took,
um,
well doing these last installs.
Um,

501
00:30:07.670 --> 00:30:10.430
just to give you an idea of the scale.
Um,

502
00:30:10.490 --> 00:30:14.870
the next thing as I mentioned is going to be the chime generator and then the

503
00:30:14.871 --> 00:30:17.500
dials and then the parts that go at the top that uh,

504
00:30:17.540 --> 00:30:22.280
do the self winding and the solar synchronizing.
Um,
we were just there.

505
00:30:23.650 --> 00:30:24.483
<v 0>Okay.</v>

506
00:30:24.940 --> 00:30:28.190
<v 1>The very last thing that we did was hook up the winder and uh,</v>

507
00:30:28.191 --> 00:30:31.910
so these guys are winding the clock for the first time.
And that,

508
00:30:32.220 --> 00:30:33.900
that big kind of thing.

509
00:30:33.901 --> 00:30:37.320
In the middle there is a rack gear that's being wound up with the weight on it

510
00:30:37.620 --> 00:30:40.650
and you can tell it moves very,
very slowly.
It would take probably,
uh,

511
00:30:40.760 --> 00:30:43.230
a whole day winding to bring it up to the top.

512
00:30:44.310 --> 00:30:47.700
And just a couple other local things that I'll mention since you guys are here

513
00:30:47.701 --> 00:30:52.470
in San Francisco.
Um,
some of you may have been to Fort Mason.
Uh,

514
00:30:52.530 --> 00:30:55.950
our headquarters are,
uh,
are right there next to green's restaurant.

515
00:30:55.951 --> 00:30:58.780
We actually have a bar and cafe called the interval,
um,

516
00:30:59.100 --> 00:31:03.090
that we operate downstairs of our office.
And we also do a lecture series.

517
00:31:03.091 --> 00:31:07.140
They're on long term thinking and then Stewart brand hosts a series mostly at SF

518
00:31:07.141 --> 00:31:12.060
jazz on longterm thinking.
Um,
last night at the interval we had Brian Behlendorf,

519
00:31:12.061 --> 00:31:17.061
one of the early founders of open source movement and Linux and a on Monday at

520
00:31:19.231 --> 00:31:22.160
SF jazz we have one Bennett,
uh,

521
00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:24.900
talking about longterm info structure,
uh,

522
00:31:24.930 --> 00:31:29.730
using blockchain technology for a file sharing and

523
00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:32.910
without,
I can take questions.

524
00:31:41.720 --> 00:31:43.050
<v 5>Can you talk a bit about maintainability?</v>

525
00:31:43.051 --> 00:31:46.040
There's all these like really large gears that you machine.

526
00:31:46.050 --> 00:31:47.790
Then the ceramic ball bearings.

527
00:31:47.791 --> 00:31:52.650
Like how do you expect people in 5,000 years to be able to replace parts if they

528
00:31:52.651 --> 00:31:53.484
need to or anything like?

529
00:31:54.580 --> 00:31:58.240
<v 1>Well,
um,
the tolerances that we operate on are actually very,</v>

530
00:31:58.241 --> 00:32:03.241
very sloppy con in its comparison to modern machining techniques.

531
00:32:03.761 --> 00:32:06.280
We are using modern machining techniques,
but um,

532
00:32:06.460 --> 00:32:10.240
but actually you could cast these same parts out of bronze and still do it,

533
00:32:10.241 --> 00:32:14.500
which would be kind of 5,000 years ago.
Technology.
Um,
we have made,

534
00:32:14.790 --> 00:32:15.370
um,

535
00:32:15.370 --> 00:32:19.690
we have made as much of the clock as possible disassemblable and carry outable.

536
00:32:19.930 --> 00:32:20.410
Um,

537
00:32:20.410 --> 00:32:24.580
but we also are trying to balance that against people stealing parts of it over

538
00:32:24.581 --> 00:32:28.960
time.
Um,
so you can,
um,
the parts that you need to get to,
you can,

539
00:32:28.961 --> 00:32:31.000
without taking the entire clock apart,

540
00:32:31.001 --> 00:32:32.860
like to replace a bearing or something like that,

541
00:32:33.190 --> 00:32:35.650
you could replace any of the bearings that we are putting in the clock with

542
00:32:35.980 --> 00:32:40.670
stainless steel bearings or some future material that is maybe better than even

543
00:32:40.671 --> 00:32:44.030
than ceramics as well.
Our goal was that we,
you know,

544
00:32:44.031 --> 00:32:49.031
we tested all of the cycles to the number that they need to do and beyond,

545
00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:51.230
uh,
in making the clock.

546
00:32:51.320 --> 00:32:55.280
But that's not to say that something won't happen that causes that maintenance

547
00:32:55.281 --> 00:32:57.380
to be needed,
but our hope is that,
uh,

548
00:32:57.530 --> 00:33:00.290
at least kind of very large scale maintenance does not have to happen.

549
00:33:02.880 --> 00:33:06.480
<v 6>Yeah.
Hi.
I'm just want to make sure you can hear me.
Uh,
so two questions.</v>

550
00:33:06.481 --> 00:33:09.450
First is when do you expect the construction on the clock to be completely

551
00:33:09.451 --> 00:33:12.590
finished and open to the public?
And then the second,
um,

552
00:33:12.690 --> 00:33:16.140
I don't know if you necessarily answered this,
but you know,
why a clock,

553
00:33:16.141 --> 00:33:19.020
if you want to inspire people to think long term,
you know,

554
00:33:19.021 --> 00:33:23.420
you brought up the concept of library.
You were certainly,
um,
you know,

555
00:33:23.460 --> 00:33:27.410
quick to bring up like Silverado Familia and some of the other like,
you know,

556
00:33:27.420 --> 00:33:30.090
why is it that it was a clock that was finally decided upon?

557
00:33:31.580 --> 00:33:35.920
<v 1>Um,
yeah,
so I'll take the last one first.
The,
um,</v>

558
00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:41.940
I mean I think it really could have been anything.

559
00:33:41.941 --> 00:33:44.910
And I think there's also the question and you know,
why of monuments scale clock,

560
00:33:44.911 --> 00:33:48.810
right.
And,
um,
the,
the goal was to,

561
00:33:49.350 --> 00:33:51.240
to create a kind of a,
you know,
in a way,

562
00:33:51.241 --> 00:33:54.840
a theatrical experience that changes the way people think about time.

563
00:33:54.841 --> 00:33:59.670
And if we're going to,
um,
if we're going to do that on this human scale,
I mean,

564
00:33:59.671 --> 00:34:03.090
you could pick a,
there's all kinds of ways to build a 10,000 year clock.

565
00:34:03.091 --> 00:34:05.340
You could plant forests every,
you know,

566
00:34:05.370 --> 00:34:09.210
kind of pie shape of forest every hundred years or something like that.

567
00:34:09.211 --> 00:34:11.790
So there's a,
there's many ways to do it.
But,
um,

568
00:34:11.840 --> 00:34:13.830
we were looking for something that would create,

569
00:34:13.831 --> 00:34:18.030
that would hold an image in people's minds that they would want to travel to,

570
00:34:18.031 --> 00:34:19.350
or even if they never traveled to,

571
00:34:19.351 --> 00:34:23.370
they would still kind of be able to hold a reference in their lives as a,
as a,

572
00:34:23.730 --> 00:34:28.350
as a object that was made by people that was designed to last for that long.

573
00:34:28.650 --> 00:34:32.520
Um,
and since it's about time clock just seems to make sense in that,

574
00:34:32.700 --> 00:34:37.510
in that scale.
Um,
yeah.
So I think,

575
00:34:37.570 --> 00:34:39.550
um,
there's,
there's all kinds of ways to do it.

576
00:34:39.551 --> 00:34:41.440
This is one of the ways that we chose.
We also,
as I mentioned,

577
00:34:41.441 --> 00:34:44.840
we have many other projects.
Um,
we also have a project on,
you know,

578
00:34:44.930 --> 00:34:48.940
betting on longterm things of scientific and social consequence.

579
00:34:49.240 --> 00:34:53.890
Um,
we have that there was that a project and lectures,
but I think,

580
00:34:53.891 --> 00:34:55.390
you know,
if you're,
if you were,

581
00:34:55.990 --> 00:34:59.590
we could have just released a white paper on longterm thinking,
but,
um,
you know,

582
00:34:59.591 --> 00:35:03.550
how effective is that in terms of actually making new stories and new myths,

583
00:35:03.551 --> 00:35:07.720
a new cultural memes,
probably not very effective.
Um,

584
00:35:08.170 --> 00:35:12.100
so we wanted something that people would actually tell stories about.
And,
um,

585
00:35:12.340 --> 00:35:14.980
we've been lucky that there's already been even,
we're not done with the clock.

586
00:35:14.981 --> 00:35:18.420
We had,
you know,
Neal Stephenson wrote a book called Nfm,
uh,
who's,

587
00:35:18.560 --> 00:35:21.850
it was in New York Times bestselling science fiction book that was about a world

588
00:35:21.851 --> 00:35:23.760
with 10,000 year clocks in it.
So,
you know,

589
00:35:23.790 --> 00:35:26.740
we're starting to get the right new stories told.
Uh,

590
00:35:26.770 --> 00:35:31.360
hopefully there will be more than you had another question.
Oh,

591
00:35:31.710 --> 00:35:33.910
when it'll be done.
Yeah.
Um,
we don't have an end date.

592
00:35:33.940 --> 00:35:36.370
We've never worked towards an end date or with an end date.

593
00:35:36.630 --> 00:35:41.030
We're very to have a patron that allows that.
Um,
and um,

594
00:35:41.580 --> 00:35:46.080
the goal has always been to just do it right.
And,
uh,
but I would say,
you know,

595
00:35:46.081 --> 00:35:48.000
we're,
as you can see,

596
00:35:48.001 --> 00:35:52.960
we're vastly more far along than we were two decades ago.
And,
um,

597
00:35:52.980 --> 00:35:57.300
we're now at the point where working pretty quickly is required just kind of

598
00:35:57.301 --> 00:36:02.301
from an efficiency standpoint where ever we have everybody that's designed it

599
00:36:02.640 --> 00:36:03.750
still on the team,

600
00:36:04.020 --> 00:36:06.750
they all go there for the installation and we don't want to lose those people,

601
00:36:06.970 --> 00:36:11.220
uh,
to other projects as we,
as we finish this.
So we're trying to work pretty,
uh,

602
00:36:11.250 --> 00:36:14.220
pretty effectively.
So it's feeling like years,
not decades at this point.

603
00:36:14.660 --> 00:36:15.493
<v 0>Yes.</v>

604
00:36:20.020 --> 00:36:23.710
<v 1>We will see it will be open to the public,
but yes.</v>

605
00:36:24.750 --> 00:36:25.583
Not yet.

606
00:36:25.620 --> 00:36:26.453
<v 0>No.</v>

607
00:36:27.160 --> 00:36:29.970
<v 2>If we could do one question from the door,
either online questions,
uh,</v>

608
00:36:30.030 --> 00:36:34.730
someone actually asked about the novel Nfm that you mentioned.
Um,
and,
uh,

609
00:36:34.770 --> 00:36:37.170
specifically as to the events described in the novel,

610
00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:39.870
in turn inspire any changes in the 10,000 year clock

611
00:36:39.980 --> 00:36:44.210
<v 1>work that's ongoing?
Um,
that's an interesting question.
I think,
I mean,</v>

612
00:36:44.211 --> 00:36:48.770
we refer to that novel and so just to catch everybody up,

613
00:36:48.771 --> 00:36:53.090
I won't without giving any spoilers.
It was,
uh,
it was,
uh,
a world not this world.

614
00:36:53.420 --> 00:36:53.870
Um,

615
00:36:53.870 --> 00:36:58.870
but I'm kind of in a parallel universe that I'm the only academic people in the

616
00:36:59.631 --> 00:37:02.180
world lived in these kind of cathedral,

617
00:37:02.181 --> 00:37:06.470
like things that had these either a century clock or a thousand year clock or a

618
00:37:06.471 --> 00:37:09.470
10,000 year clock.
And,
uh,

619
00:37:09.560 --> 00:37:13.460
the rest of the entire world was basically kind of like mall culture.
Um,

620
00:37:13.520 --> 00:37:18.230
and so all of the academic thinking in longterm thinking happened,
uh,
in these,

621
00:37:18.320 --> 00:37:22.730
uh,
in these cathedrals.
Um,
and we're,

622
00:37:22.731 --> 00:37:25.340
and so it was kind of like monks,
but they weren't a religion.

623
00:37:25.341 --> 00:37:30.200
They were a religion of longterm thinking in a way.
And,
um,
so,
uh,

624
00:37:31.100 --> 00:37:35.330
I think we have often referred to the book in the sense of like,

625
00:37:35.331 --> 00:37:38.810
who is going to be that?
The people who,
um,

626
00:37:39.020 --> 00:37:44.020
help either maintain or are they kind of docents have this experience,

627
00:37:44.260 --> 00:37:45.980
uh,
or just protect it.
Um,

628
00:37:46.040 --> 00:37:48.800
and so that I think has been informed by that a little bit.

629
00:37:50.160 --> 00:37:50.993
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

630
00:37:55.630 --> 00:37:56.660
<v 2>Uh,
thank you.
Uh,</v>

631
00:37:56.720 --> 00:38:01.670
do you have any thoughts about what Google can do to influence London thinking?

632
00:38:03.730 --> 00:38:05.610
<v 1>Uh,
yeah.
What can Google do?
I mean,</v>

633
00:38:05.611 --> 00:38:09.480
I think one of the problems that we started working on in one of the reasons

634
00:38:09.510 --> 00:38:11.640
that Rosetta project came up,
um,

635
00:38:11.880 --> 00:38:16.880
and we did it in this extremely analog method of something that you can put

636
00:38:18.091 --> 00:38:23.091
under a microscope and read rather than on floppy disks or hard disks or

637
00:38:23.431 --> 00:38:26.780
whatever,
uh,
was because we realized we're were,

638
00:38:26.781 --> 00:38:30.620
we're effectively archiving the world's culture at this point,
uh,

639
00:38:30.630 --> 00:38:35.100
as born digital information,
um,
or retroactively scanning it in.

640
00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:37.150
Um,
and you know,

641
00:38:37.151 --> 00:38:42.151
a thousand years ago we wrote things down on rocks and you can still read the

642
00:38:42.251 --> 00:38:44.530
rocks.
And a hundred years ago we wrote things down on books.

643
00:38:44.531 --> 00:38:45.670
And you can still read the books.

644
00:38:46.180 --> 00:38:49.780
20 years ago we wrote things down with some of the early databases,

645
00:38:49.781 --> 00:38:53.580
which are all totally lost,
right?
And,
um,

646
00:38:55.240 --> 00:38:57.970
we have definitely have some of some great advantages.

647
00:38:57.970 --> 00:39:00.940
Now two things are much more connected and things are in a way more

648
00:39:00.941 --> 00:39:02.800
interoperable because of the Internet,

649
00:39:03.490 --> 00:39:08.290
but we are not archiving things the way that,

650
00:39:08.410 --> 00:39:12.850
uh,
that can be necessarily read in thousands of years.

651
00:39:13.270 --> 00:39:14.380
And,
um,

652
00:39:14.410 --> 00:39:19.410
so as I think that Google is in a a unique position obviously of having so much

653
00:39:20.681 --> 00:39:23.740
data,
so much,
so much writing material.
I mean,
if,

654
00:39:23.770 --> 00:39:26.710
if the modern William Shakespeare was writing now,

655
00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:31.660
would you be able to read that content 500 years from now is an interesting kind

656
00:39:31.661 --> 00:39:35.530
of question to ask yourself.
And uh,
you know,
the,

657
00:39:35.950 --> 00:39:39.280
the design principle that we use on the clock is if we burrowed into the

658
00:39:39.281 --> 00:39:42.970
mountain and we found the clock already there,
what do we wish we had found?

659
00:39:43.630 --> 00:39:48.190
And so I might ask you to think about the ways that information is being created

660
00:39:48.191 --> 00:39:51.730
and stored,
that if you found it a thousand years from now,

661
00:39:51.731 --> 00:39:56.140
what do you wish you had done to make sure that that data was saved?

662
00:39:58.460 --> 00:40:00.930
Uh,
which alternate with the Dory?
Um,

663
00:40:01.300 --> 00:40:04.060
someone asks about the sky map at the Hoover dam.

664
00:40:04.140 --> 00:40:08.490
Are you familiar with that area?
And you have any,
any comments?
Add A,
yeah,

665
00:40:08.491 --> 00:40:12.020
so there's a,
there's a very interesting site,
um,
that is,
uh,

666
00:40:12.060 --> 00:40:15.910
very poorly documented.
And if you have ever visited the Hoover dam,

667
00:40:15.911 --> 00:40:19.160
you probably have visited it and not known it,
but as you,
um,

668
00:40:19.570 --> 00:40:22.690
as you come down onto the damage now I guess you can walk on,

669
00:40:22.691 --> 00:40:25.720
but you can't drive vehicles on.
They have a new overpass.
Um,

670
00:40:25.750 --> 00:40:30.750
there's a inlaid floor that was done by an artist named last name of Hansen,

671
00:40:31.090 --> 00:40:33.010
I believe.
Uh,
and it's,

672
00:40:33.310 --> 00:40:38.310
and then there's just too beautiful statues next to it.

673
00:40:38.501 --> 00:40:42.850
And what he did was he used the procession of the equinoxes that I mentioned

674
00:40:42.851 --> 00:40:47.770
that are Kim references to,
um,
to make an image of the,

675
00:40:47.830 --> 00:40:51.940
of the night sky.
And the major planets and stars.

676
00:40:52.420 --> 00:40:56.020
Um,
the day that the Hoover dam was,
was,
uh,

677
00:40:56.890 --> 00:41:01.420
commissioned effectively.
And so setting in in time,

678
00:41:01.690 --> 00:41:05.770
the date of when the Hoover dam was built in this floor,

679
00:41:05.860 --> 00:41:08.230
a terrazzo floor that has absolutely,

680
00:41:08.231 --> 00:41:11.870
it's super beautiful and it's super well thought out and super well done.
Um,

681
00:41:11.950 --> 00:41:14.500
unfortunately that whole site is run by the Bureau of land reclamation,

682
00:41:14.501 --> 00:41:18.940
which is not the most future thinking a site or one that cares as much about

683
00:41:18.941 --> 00:41:20.980
this.
So they have almost no information about it.

684
00:41:20.981 --> 00:41:25.981
I was able to talk them out of sending me the blueprints for it and uh,

685
00:41:26.360 --> 00:41:29.500
I scan those and put them up on the Internet archive and did a whole blog piece

686
00:41:29.501 --> 00:41:32.080
on the lung.
Now blog,
if you're for people who are interested,

687
00:41:32.290 --> 00:41:37.280
I think it's probably most documentation that that site has.
Um,
and it's,
uh,

688
00:41:37.550 --> 00:41:39.920
it's a really cool one and if you're ever at the Hoover Dam,

689
00:41:39.921 --> 00:41:41.420
you can impress your friends by pointing it out.

690
00:41:47.680 --> 00:41:50.610
<v 7>So it's two questions.
So they probably,
you know,</v>

691
00:41:50.650 --> 00:41:54.370
first one you probably answered like say the cloak is ready on the next day.

692
00:41:54.371 --> 00:41:57.970
Something like the rapture acquirers,
I neighbor,
every human being disappears.

693
00:41:58.320 --> 00:42:02.440
You expect the clock to work actually 10,000 years with no one actually looking

694
00:42:02.441 --> 00:42:05.680
at it.
Um,
the second actually has to do with the,

695
00:42:06.070 --> 00:42:09.880
they're like the Japanese approach or the temple approach under the Japanese
one.

696
00:42:10.240 --> 00:42:11.530
Like there's two ways to do it.

697
00:42:11.531 --> 00:42:15.550
Like the statical thing that is meant to work or someone called an evolutionary

698
00:42:15.551 --> 00:42:20.551
thing that you will depend on some kind of mission that actually holds itself to

699
00:42:21.011 --> 00:42:23.460
advance.
Right?
Because in his 5,000 years,

700
00:42:23.461 --> 00:42:27.730
they every kind of language reference to English the United States.
Yeah.

701
00:42:28.420 --> 00:42:31.580
Or human like gold,
you're disappears.
Uh,

702
00:42:32.030 --> 00:42:36.550
are we able to get some kind of other culture to understand what they see is

703
00:42:36.850 --> 00:42:40.750
like,
is it self documentary enough over?
Because if you have like this kind of,

704
00:42:41.440 --> 00:42:42.530
um,
I dunno,

705
00:42:42.550 --> 00:42:46.450
mission that actually can keep going on regeneration to generation.

706
00:42:46.960 --> 00:42:48.730
Which one do you think is more reliable?

707
00:42:49.590 --> 00:42:52.500
<v 1>Both wrists,
right?
Um,
yeah,
I mean,</v>

708
00:42:52.501 --> 00:42:55.680
I think the probably the largest risks to the clock is people,

709
00:42:55.681 --> 00:42:58.530
but the reason we're building it is for people.
So,
you know,

710
00:42:58.531 --> 00:43:03.240
we designed it very much for people and to work with people.
But,
um,
you know,

711
00:43:03.390 --> 00:43:06.530
we,
we did,
we have done it.

712
00:43:06.531 --> 00:43:09.860
We have made best efforts to make sure that everything will work for 10,000

713
00:43:09.861 --> 00:43:14.010
years all by itself.
The dials wouldn't update,
but it would still,
no one now is,

714
00:43:14.011 --> 00:43:16.220
and if someone showed up at the end of that 10,000 years,

715
00:43:16.730 --> 00:43:21.650
they could wind it and get there.
Um,
the question of,
um,

716
00:43:23.330 --> 00:43:28.160
if the,
uh,
sorry,
the last question was about,
um,

717
00:43:28.850 --> 00:43:31.730
kind of approaches that you can take like this problem of Oh,

718
00:43:31.731 --> 00:43:36.230
the incremental approach.
Yeah.
So,
uh,
again,
the goal here was to get,

719
00:43:36.350 --> 00:43:39.320
make something that people would tell stories about.
And I think,
um,
you know,

720
00:43:39.321 --> 00:43:42.520
people do tell stories about some of these other things like the,
um,
the,

721
00:43:42.710 --> 00:43:45.260
the Shinto shrine at Esa.
Um,

722
00:43:45.320 --> 00:43:49.550
and certainly hope there's whole belief systems that,
um,
that that's central to.

723
00:43:49.940 --> 00:43:52.940
And so that's a totally reasonable one.
Um,

724
00:43:53.150 --> 00:43:57.620
this was just kind of the one that we chose to give a try.
Uh,
and so the,

725
00:43:57.621 --> 00:44:01.810
the documentation part of it,
we,
that Rosetta disk that I mentioned,
um,

726
00:44:02.030 --> 00:44:05.810
we did put all the plans of the clock on that desk,
uh,

727
00:44:05.811 --> 00:44:08.990
and have continued to update them as some of the new versions of that desk has

728
00:44:08.991 --> 00:44:13.310
come out and,
uh,
gives us a way to document over very long periods of time.

729
00:44:15.350 --> 00:44:18.030
<v 2>Was there anybody,
let me take one more.
Sure.
Um,
so there's,
uh,</v>

730
00:44:18.050 --> 00:44:21.740
there's a bunch of questions online about sort of the,
you know,

731
00:44:21.741 --> 00:44:25.040
the longterm resistance of the clock.
The Earth is in motion,
complex system,

732
00:44:25.041 --> 00:44:29.900
all that stuff.
Um,
so maybe just a couple of those.
Um,
someone asked,

733
00:44:29.930 --> 00:44:32.400
uh,
what happen the event of an earthquake

734
00:44:32.430 --> 00:44:35.410
<v 1>if it's resistant.
And there's another question about,
um,</v>

735
00:44:35.760 --> 00:44:39.420
how much change can be tolerated in the temperature difference that actually

736
00:44:39.421 --> 00:44:44.340
powers the clock.
Uh,
good questions.
Yeah,
so I'm the earthquake thing.
We,
you know,

737
00:44:44.341 --> 00:44:46.050
we're building in West Texas,
which is,

738
00:44:46.440 --> 00:44:49.440
it's not the most stable tectonic place on the earth.

739
00:44:49.441 --> 00:44:54.240
Something like Australia probably would be.
Um,
but it's pretty stable.
And,

740
00:44:54.241 --> 00:44:57.860
um,
we started with a geologic report that basically said,
um,

741
00:44:58.230 --> 00:45:01.260
that we're up to a 6.0 may happen.

742
00:45:01.410 --> 00:45:05.280
It's a one in 10,000 chance that a 6.0 will happen in 10,000 over the course of

743
00:45:05.281 --> 00:45:07.770
10,000 years.
So we,
uh,

744
00:45:07.800 --> 00:45:12.800
we went with 6.0 as our Richter scale design and even did some simulations of

745
00:45:13.351 --> 00:45:17.340
that big weight that was hanging to see if it would swing and weird ways and

746
00:45:17.341 --> 00:45:22.280
rack into things,
um,
and uh,
and made a few modifications to,

747
00:45:22.400 --> 00:45:24.900
to deal with those kinds of waves that might come through the site.

748
00:45:24.900 --> 00:45:28.530
Because of that.
Um,
as I mentioned,
we're in,

749
00:45:28.531 --> 00:45:32.910
we're very close to Carlsbad caverns and those caverns are built in the exact

750
00:45:32.911 --> 00:45:34.020
site or built where they were.

751
00:45:34.320 --> 00:45:38.550
They were formed in the same limestone and have lasted between two and 60

752
00:45:38.550 --> 00:45:42.240
million years.
So the underground space is pretty darn,
um,

753
00:45:42.480 --> 00:45:45.090
I think resilient on the kind of timescale that we're talking about.

754
00:45:46.410 --> 00:45:49.050
And uh,
what was the last one?

755
00:45:50.370 --> 00:45:53.520
A temperature difference.
How much could be different?
Could be tolerated.
Um,
yeah.

756
00:45:53.521 --> 00:45:55.180
So the temperature,
the thing that,

757
00:45:55.240 --> 00:45:59.330
that synchronizes the clock to the sun as well as the thing that,
uh,

758
00:45:59.700 --> 00:46:02.460
pulls energy is a differential engine.

759
00:46:02.461 --> 00:46:07.330
It is not a absolute engine.
Um,
and so,
uh,
there's,
uh,

760
00:46:07.520 --> 00:46:10.800
the air system is kind of,
it's the,
the seals on it,

761
00:46:10.830 --> 00:46:14.190
our ceramic and,
uh,
the Piston is graphite.

762
00:46:14.220 --> 00:46:16.820
And so it's not like sealed with rubber.
Uh,

763
00:46:16.890 --> 00:46:19.420
we didn't think there's any kind of seals like that that would last anyway,

764
00:46:19.440 --> 00:46:22.440
but they basically let a little bit of error by,
so,
um,

765
00:46:22.470 --> 00:46:27.470
they're always finding a kind of the design was to find a about a week long

766
00:46:27.841 --> 00:46:32.730
equilibrium of what average temperature was to then have a tank that that's

767
00:46:32.731 --> 00:46:35.250
getting heated by the sun to give you a difference.

768
00:46:35.490 --> 00:46:39.510
And so even some of the places like Antarctica,
um,
have,
uh,

769
00:46:39.511 --> 00:46:41.400
or some of the hottest deserts in the world,

770
00:46:41.401 --> 00:46:44.460
they still have huge differences between day and night temperature,

771
00:46:44.461 --> 00:46:48.030
even though they're at their absolutes are much more extreme than we are now.

772
00:46:48.031 --> 00:46:53.010
So should work.
We'll see.
Thank you everybody.

773
00:46:54.120 --> 00:46:58.340
