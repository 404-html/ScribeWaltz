1
00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:12.540
Thanks Bjorn n done.
I've really been looking forward to coming today.

2
00:00:12.541 --> 00:00:17.010
I actually grew up just a stone's throw away in Stuyvesant town and my dad owned

3
00:00:17.011 --> 00:00:20.940
a toy store right across the street from there.
So it's always fun to come home.

4
00:00:20.941 --> 00:00:25.941
But also because a lot of my work recently in the last decade or so has been on

5
00:00:26.401 --> 00:00:31.401
the history of science and I actually use Google tools all the time when I'm

6
00:00:31.801 --> 00:00:34.470
doing that work and they're extraordinarily helpful.
So it,

7
00:00:34.471 --> 00:00:37.740
so it's a pleasure to have a chance to talk with you today.

8
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.950
So I'm going to start with a question.

9
00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:45.900
I suppose that you could build the perfect dog.

10
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.910
What would be the key ingredients in your recipe?

11
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.030
Well,
you definitely want cute,

12
00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:59.450
maybe something with floppy ears and a curly tail that wags and anticipation

13
00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.930
whenever you're around,
you'd want smart,

14
00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.300
you'd want loyal,
and you definitely want unconditional love.

15
00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.290
The thing is that you do not need to build this animal because for the last 60

16
00:01:17.131 --> 00:01:17.964
years,

17
00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.240
a dedicated team of Russian geneticists in Siberia have been building it for

18
00:01:24.541 --> 00:01:27.300
you.
The perfect dog,

19
00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:33.120
except as you might guess from the title of today's talk,
it's not a dog at all.

20
00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.800
It's a Fox,
a domesticated Fox.

21
00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:43.160
They built this in the minus 40 degree winters of Siberia,

22
00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.240
but more importantly,

23
00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:50.100
they built it in the blink of an eye in terms of evolutionary time,

24
00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:55.430
a hundredth of the time that I took our ancestors to domesticate wolves into

25
00:01:57.061 --> 00:01:57.894
dogs.

26
00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:03.380
This is my friend and colleague and coauthor,
Lewd Mila

27
00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:06.330
would.

28
00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:11.340
Mila recently turned 85 years old and every day,

29
00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.080
including today for the last 60 years,

30
00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:21.530
she has led what's come to be known as the Silver Fox domestication experiment.

31
00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:27.090
And for the last 10 years or so,

32
00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:32.120
I've had the honor of working with her as a historian of science to tell the

33
00:02:32.671 --> 00:02:37.671
story of what they have done to as many people as we possibly can.

34
00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.640
So today I am going to tell you about domesticated foxes that will melt your

35
00:02:45.061 --> 00:02:48.810
hearts and lick your ears just like this guy did.

36
00:02:48.811 --> 00:02:53.811
Five seconds after they put them into my arms in Siberia.

37
00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:55.471
More than that though.

38
00:02:55.471 --> 00:03:00.471
I'm going to tell you about cutting edge work on this process of domestication,

39
00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:05.910
which is not something only of interest to biologists because if you think about

40
00:03:06.611 --> 00:03:07.444
it,

41
00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:11.890
when our ancestors began domesticating plants and animals,

42
00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:16.990
we dramatically changed our own evolutionary history.
We would be very,

43
00:03:16.991 --> 00:03:19.570
very different if we had not done that.

44
00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:23.830
And this experiment that we're going to talk about is the gold standard for

45
00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:28.420
understanding how domestication comes about.

46
00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:33.850
So I'm going to try and give you an overview of what they've been doing and why

47
00:03:33.851 --> 00:03:36.940
it's important.
60 years.

48
00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:42.760
The experiment starts with this fellow Dimitri Goliath.

49
00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:48.720
In the late 1930s Goliath was an undergraduate student at a place called the Eva

50
00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:55.810
Nova Agricultural Academy outside of Moscow.
And while he was there,

51
00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:00.310
he studied genetics and because it was an agricultural academy,

52
00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:05.430
he had all sorts of interactions with domesticated species when he graduated,

53
00:04:08.201 --> 00:04:12.340
even Nova,
like every Soviet male of that era,

54
00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:16.180
he went and fought in World War II for four years.

55
00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:18.070
After that,

56
00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:23.640
he came back and landed a position as a research scientist at a place called the

57
00:04:24.311 --> 00:04:26.080
central research laboratory.

58
00:04:26.081 --> 00:04:31.081
For for breeding animals also in Moscow and it was there that belie of came up

59
00:04:31.811 --> 00:04:36.811
with the idea that would eventually become this silver Fox domestication

60
00:04:37.181 --> 00:04:39.370
experiment.
And it started like this.

61
00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:45.510
He knew from his interaction with domesticated species and also from reading

62
00:04:47.591 --> 00:04:50.890
Darwin's famous book about domestication.

63
00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:55.600
He knew that many domesticated animals share a house suite of characteristics,

64
00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:59.980
so they tend to have things like floppy ears and curly tails.

65
00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:02.680
They also tend to have sort of juvenile lies,

66
00:05:02.681 --> 00:05:07.060
body and facial features compared to their wild ancestors.

67
00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:10.270
They tend to have low stress hormone levels.

68
00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:14.380
They tend to have all sorts of variation in their coat color,

69
00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:19.660
and they also typically have much longer reproductive seasons.

70
00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:22.420
Then their wild ancestors,

71
00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:26.950
not every domesticated animal has every one of those characteristics,

72
00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:31.210
but most have many of those characteristics.

73
00:05:31.211 --> 00:05:35.500
So much so that that whole thing,
the floppy ears,
the curly tail tails,

74
00:05:35.501 --> 00:05:36.460
the low stress on moments,

75
00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:40.750
all that is referred to today as the domestication syndrome

76
00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:44.050
and belay have thought about this and he thought,
you know,

77
00:05:44.051 --> 00:05:49.051
this is really weird because our ancestors domesticated species for all sorts of

78
00:05:51.191 --> 00:05:55.210
different reasons.
Sunlight,
horses.
We domesticated for transportation.

79
00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:59.360
Others we domesticated as food sources and yet others like dogs.

80
00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:04.630
We domesticated for some combination of protection and companionship.

81
00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:08.360
Yet regardless of what we domesticate them for,

82
00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:13.930
they tend to have many of the characteristics in the domestication syndrome.

83
00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:19.430
Why
and the layoffs hypothesis went like this.

84
00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:25.300
The one thing that our ancestors always needed in whatever species they were

85
00:06:25.701 --> 00:06:30.530
trying to domesticate was an animal that would not try and bite their heads off.

86
00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:36.700
And so he hypothesized that the earliest stages of all animal domestication

87
00:06:37.011 --> 00:06:40.430
events involved our ancestors choosing the calmest,

88
00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:44.720
tamest friendliest towards human animals.

89
00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:50.000
He further hypothesize that somehow,
and he really didn't know how,

90
00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:54.590
but somehow all of those other characteristics and the domestication syndrome,

91
00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:57.530
longer reproductive periods,
juvenile eyes,
facial features,

92
00:06:57.531 --> 00:07:02.531
all of that with somehow genetically connected to choosing animals based on how

93
00:07:03.081 --> 00:07:06.110
friendly they were towards humans,

94
00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:12.310
and he decided he would test these ideas in real time using the foxes that he

95
00:07:14.181 --> 00:07:18.920
became very familiar with at the laboratory for,
for breeding animals.

96
00:07:18.921 --> 00:07:20.240
Because at that laboratory,

97
00:07:20.241 --> 00:07:25.241
the two key species they worked with were foxes and mink because there was so

98
00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.230
much money associated with Fox for and mink fur,

99
00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:36.130
so he decided he would test these ideas in foxes and the experiment he envision

100
00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:39.320
was very basic.
At its core,

101
00:07:39.890 --> 00:07:44.890
he imagined testing hundreds of foxes and choosing the calmest ones,

102
00:07:46.131 --> 00:07:50.240
the ones that are most friendly towards humans preferentially breeding them.

103
00:07:51.530 --> 00:07:55.760
Then when they're pups grow up,
test them,

104
00:07:56.660 --> 00:08:00.560
preferentially choose the ones that are friendliest towards humans do this

105
00:08:00.561 --> 00:08:04.670
generation after generation after generation foxes breed once a year,

106
00:08:04.671 --> 00:08:06.830
so essentially one year equals one generation.

107
00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:13.150
He would do this every generation and he would see first of all was he in fact

108
00:08:13.851 --> 00:08:16.040
getting inherently calmer,

109
00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:21.100
friendlier to human animals and it's strictly choosing them based on how

110
00:08:22.701 --> 00:08:23.481
friendly they were.

111
00:08:23.481 --> 00:08:28.481
Did he also begin to see the emergence of other traits in the domestication

112
00:08:29.151 --> 00:08:30.420
syndrome?
Right?

113
00:08:30.770 --> 00:08:33.980
Did they start showing lower stress hormone or hormone levels or other

114
00:08:33.981 --> 00:08:36.230
characteristics of domestication syndrome?

115
00:08:38.570 --> 00:08:43.570
This is a classic experiment in evolution and genetics.

116
00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:50.500
But belay have had a problem and it was a big problem because as he came up with

117
00:08:54.261 --> 00:08:59.261
this idea in mid 1940s it was a time when he was illegal to do modern genetics

118
00:09:03.450 --> 00:09:05.130
in the Soviet Union.

119
00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:10.830
And the reason that it was illegal was because of this person right here.

120
00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:14.970
Trophism Lysenko Lysenko was a fraud.

121
00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:20.300
A Charlatan is pseudo scientists who had risen up both in the scientific and

122
00:09:21.391 --> 00:09:24.060
political ranks of the Soviet Union.

123
00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:29.960
And what Lysenko said was that modern genetics was Bougie.

124
00:09:33.890 --> 00:09:38.890
Are Science being promulgated by wreckers and spies from the West?

125
00:09:41.070 --> 00:09:46.070
That instead he argued a long disproven idea known as Lamarckian inheritance was

126
00:09:48.811 --> 00:09:51.690
in fact not only correct,

127
00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:56.610
but more in line with Soviet philosophy.

128
00:09:57.210 --> 00:10:02.210
He then went and made up a bunch of studies that he never did to suggest that he

129
00:10:02.611 --> 00:10:06.120
was in fact,
right.
And by doing this,

130
00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:11.420
he rose up to become not only one of the most powerful scientists in the Soviet

131
00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:13.860
Union,

132
00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:18.660
but Stalin's right hand man on science.

133
00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:23.850
So this picture comes from a conference where Lysenko was giving one of these

134
00:10:23.851 --> 00:10:28.770
fire spinning talks,
calling Western geneticists saboteurs and wreckers.

135
00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:33.150
And when he finish,
Stalin's stood up and yelled out,

136
00:10:33.180 --> 00:10:37.860
Bravo Comrade Lysenko because of Lysenko,

137
00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:42.030
thousands of Soviet geneticists lost their jobs.

138
00:10:42.930 --> 00:10:45.420
Hundreds,
we're thrown into prison.

139
00:10:46.350 --> 00:10:51.350
And about 20 were actually murdered by Lysenko Sankoh's thugs for doing the

140
00:10:51.601 --> 00:10:54.960
crime of modern western genetics.

141
00:10:55.680 --> 00:11:00.680
This is the environment in which belay of is conceiving an experiment in

142
00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:02.520
genetics.

143
00:11:04.290 --> 00:11:09.290
Nobody knows better how dangerous this is because one of those 20 people who was

144
00:11:11.011 --> 00:11:15.660
murdered by Lysenko was ballet [inaudible] older brother,
20 years older,

145
00:11:15.690 --> 00:11:20.690
who had been an up and coming star in the field of genetics,

146
00:11:21.690 --> 00:11:26.690
but lay of decided this was too important and he was going to do it.

147
00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:30.390
So he initiated a tiny little pilot study.

148
00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:36.200
He has a friend who runs a Fox farm in Estonia and there are hundreds of these

149
00:11:37.591 --> 00:11:41.580
Fox farms around the Soviet Union and their satellites because again,

150
00:11:41.581 --> 00:11:45.660
there's so much money selling Fox firs to the west.

151
00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:49.800
So he talks to one of his colleagues in Estonia who runs one of these smaller

152
00:11:49.801 --> 00:11:52.530
farms and he says,
here's what I want to do.

153
00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:56.200
I want to even experiment where I select the calmest Hamus ones.

154
00:11:56.830 --> 00:11:58.360
And it's a small pilot experiment,

155
00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:01.900
involves testing a couple of dozen foxes every year,

156
00:12:02.590 --> 00:12:05.110
test them on how friendly or not they are towards humans.

157
00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:10.920
Breathe the ones that are friendliest and he and his colleagues do this for four

158
00:12:11.141 --> 00:12:15.010
or five years and the results are promising.
Even in that short amount of time,

159
00:12:15.310 --> 00:12:20.310
they began to see animals that were inherently a little friendlier towards

160
00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:23.830
humans,
then believes,

161
00:12:23.831 --> 00:12:28.831
get belief gets his big chance to start a full blown experiment in 1958 what

162
00:12:31.601 --> 00:12:36.601
happens is he is offered a position as vice director at a new institute of

163
00:12:39.011 --> 00:12:43.750
biology in Siberia in a place called Novosibirsk.

164
00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:51.600
And this institute is part of a place that still exists today called Academic

165
00:12:54.190 --> 00:12:56.350
Gora doc or the academic village.

166
00:12:56.830 --> 00:13:00.280
Basically what happened was in the mid to late 1950s,

167
00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:02.980
the Soviet Soviet,
uh,

168
00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:07.030
political leaders and scientists work together and what they did was they

169
00:13:07.031 --> 00:13:12.031
cleared out a large chunk of Siberian forest near Novosibirsk and they built two

170
00:13:13.331 --> 00:13:18.160
dozen worldclass institutes associated with science.

171
00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:22.270
So there was the institute that [inaudible] was involved in as vice director in

172
00:13:22.271 --> 00:13:25.930
biology.
There was,
there were institutes in chemistry,
physics,

173
00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:27.910
early computer science and so on and so on.

174
00:13:28.150 --> 00:13:33.130
They literally brought in tens of thousands of scientists and associated people

175
00:13:33.131 --> 00:13:35.410
to build this academic village.

176
00:13:36.370 --> 00:13:41.370
So ballet if knows now that as vice director of this new institute of biology

177
00:13:42.131 --> 00:13:46.750
there that he's going to have the power and the money to start a full blown

178
00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:49.120
silver Fox domestication experiment.

179
00:13:49.210 --> 00:13:53.470
But because of all the administrative stuff he's going to have to do as vice

180
00:13:53.471 --> 00:13:54.070
director,

181
00:13:54.070 --> 00:13:58.810
what he's not going to have is the time to be the person to lead the experiment

182
00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:00.310
on a day to day basis.

183
00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:04.720
So right before he moves to academic or dock,

184
00:14:04.721 --> 00:14:05.740
while he's still in Moscow,

185
00:14:05.741 --> 00:14:10.741
he goes on a hunt for the perfect young scientists to lead this experiment.

186
00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:15.040
And he does this by going to Moscow State University,

187
00:14:15.070 --> 00:14:17.260
which is not only one of the best,

188
00:14:17.261 --> 00:14:19.480
but one of the most beautiful universities in the world.

189
00:14:19.481 --> 00:14:23.950
And he talks to some colleagues he has there and he lays out the ideas and says

190
00:14:23.951 --> 00:14:25.270
he's looking for a young scientist.

191
00:14:25.510 --> 00:14:30.510
So one of the people who comes in to interview for the job is 25 year old Lewd

192
00:14:30.621 --> 00:14:35.500
Mila.
The interview happened in 1958 when you talk to her today,

193
00:14:35.501 --> 00:14:38.560
it seems as if it happened just yesterday.

194
00:14:38.710 --> 00:14:43.710
The first thing that struck her was that belay if immediately treated her like

195
00:14:44.501 --> 00:14:49.450
an equal.
So in 1958 Soviet science was very patriarchal,

196
00:14:50.050 --> 00:14:54.680
but here was a vice director of an institute talking to a newly mentored

197
00:14:54.740 --> 00:14:59.090
undergraduate and treating them like an equal.
And that mattered.

198
00:15:00.170 --> 00:15:03.860
So believe lays out the idea we're going to test hundreds of Fox is every year

199
00:15:04.310 --> 00:15:08.720
we're going to choose the calmest,
most friendly towards human foxes,
breed them.

200
00:15:08.900 --> 00:15:10.760
We're going to do this generation after generation c,

201
00:15:10.790 --> 00:15:15.110
do we get more calmer and calmer animals and do we begin to see floppy ears and

202
00:15:15.111 --> 00:15:17.570
curly towels?
And all this stuff in the domestication syndrome.

203
00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:20.120
And Luke Neil loves the idea.

204
00:15:20.121 --> 00:15:23.660
She thinks it's a brilliant experiment and she also likes the idea of moving to

205
00:15:23.661 --> 00:15:27.860
this new scientific oasis in the middle of Siberia.

206
00:15:28.220 --> 00:15:32.030
But before she gets too excited,
belay f stops her and says,
look,

207
00:15:32.780 --> 00:15:35.720
you need to know a couple of things.
First of all,

208
00:15:36.620 --> 00:15:39.650
even though Lysenko is not as powerful as it used to be,

209
00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:42.710
if he decided to make an example of us,

210
00:15:42.711 --> 00:15:47.360
he could still throw us into prison Ludimil and knew that anyone who studied

211
00:15:47.361 --> 00:15:51.410
biology knew that,
but it meant something that the lay of stopped her and said,

212
00:15:51.411 --> 00:15:53.540
think about this.
And the other thing you said was,

213
00:15:53.541 --> 00:15:56.120
I've run this little pilot experiment.
It's promising,

214
00:15:56.210 --> 00:15:59.190
but this is an experiment in evolution,
right?

215
00:15:59.540 --> 00:16:03.860
It could take 10 years before we find anything interesting.
Could take 20 years.

216
00:16:04.010 --> 00:16:08.390
She remembers the lay of saying to her,
it could take your whole life.

217
00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:12.740
But she was hooked.
He liked what he saw.
He offered her the position.

218
00:16:12.860 --> 00:16:14.510
Six months later,
Luke,
Mila,

219
00:16:14.930 --> 00:16:18.380
her husband and their two year old daughter hop on a train from Moscow to

220
00:16:18.381 --> 00:16:19.071
Siberia,

221
00:16:19.071 --> 00:16:24.071
which is no easy train ride to begin the full blown experiment from day one.

222
00:16:25.351 --> 00:16:30.351
Would Mila will tell you that her motto comes directly from Wonderful Children's

223
00:16:32.031 --> 00:16:36.920
book,
the Little Prince where the Fox tells the little prince that you become

224
00:16:36.921 --> 00:16:39.980
responsible forever for what you have tamed.

225
00:16:41.530 --> 00:16:46.490
So look,
Neela gets there and Blake has money and power,

226
00:16:46.491 --> 00:16:51.491
but he still hasn't been able to procure a very large area to build a Fox farm.

227
00:16:52.850 --> 00:16:53.271
Right.

228
00:16:53.271 --> 00:16:58.250
An academic or dock where they could do the experiment he's working on that.

229
00:16:58.700 --> 00:17:02.180
He's planning to do it.
But at the start there is no such place yet.

230
00:17:02.450 --> 00:17:04.670
So for the first year or so live,

231
00:17:04.671 --> 00:17:07.790
Neela travels around the Soviet Union to all of the,

232
00:17:07.791 --> 00:17:09.950
you know too many of these Fox farms I've told you about.

233
00:17:09.980 --> 00:17:12.650
All of them are owned by the government of course.

234
00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:16.640
And she's trying to find the perfect place to start the experiment until they

235
00:17:16.641 --> 00:17:18.800
have someplace at academic Gora doc to move it to.

236
00:17:19.610 --> 00:17:24.470
And eventually she settles on one place known as the less,
no,
I fox farm,

237
00:17:24.770 --> 00:17:26.030
it's about,
it's an overnight,

238
00:17:26.031 --> 00:17:29.200
about 12 hour train ride from academic or a doc and leave meal.

239
00:17:29.210 --> 00:17:32.300
His plan is that she'll go down there four times a year.

240
00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:34.460
Some days will be for a couple of weeks.

241
00:17:34.490 --> 00:17:38.540
Other visits will be for a couple of months to start the full blown experiment.

242
00:17:38.930 --> 00:17:41.660
So this place,
less noise is gigantic.

243
00:17:41.690 --> 00:17:44.930
It's a cash cow for the Soviet government.

244
00:17:45.110 --> 00:17:50.110
At any given time there could be 10,000 foxes at less noise or being bred for

245
00:17:53.670 --> 00:17:56.540
pretty firm.
And when Luke meal,

246
00:17:56.541 --> 00:18:00.060
the first talked to the director there and said what she wanted to do,

247
00:18:00.510 --> 00:18:02.970
he looked at her like she was nuts.

248
00:18:03.210 --> 00:18:08.210
Why would anyone want to waste their time trying to build a friendlier Fox when

249
00:18:09.361 --> 00:18:13.130
there's so much money to be made for the government?
Infer but led.

250
00:18:13.140 --> 00:18:16.730
Mila said that [inaudible] sent me and belay his name now carried enough weight

251
00:18:16.731 --> 00:18:20.460
that the director said,
fine,
test 500 foxes,
it's not going to bother me.

252
00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:21.660
Go ahead and do it.

253
00:18:22.290 --> 00:18:26.520
So she begins the experiment and it works like this everyday at six o'clock in

254
00:18:26.521 --> 00:18:29.640
the morning she begins and she works methodically from cage to cage.

255
00:18:29.641 --> 00:18:34.320
Each fox is in its own cage and she's going to score them on how friendly or not

256
00:18:34.321 --> 00:18:35.550
they are towards her

257
00:18:37.110 --> 00:18:41.490
and she's going to score every fox twice,
once when it's a pup,

258
00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:45.870
and then once again when it's an adult and she's going to score them first as

259
00:18:46.430 --> 00:18:49.020
the,
as she approaches the cage,

260
00:18:49.590 --> 00:18:52.830
she'll note whether they are friendly or not towards her.

261
00:18:53.790 --> 00:18:56.160
Then as she stands by their clothes cage,

262
00:18:56.310 --> 00:19:01.310
then as she opens up the cage door and then as she puts something typically a

263
00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:05.340
stick or her hand in a very,

264
00:19:05.341 --> 00:19:10.341
very thick glove into the cage and she is going to score them on a scale of one

265
00:19:11.521 --> 00:19:16.521
to four where four means relatively calm and friendly and one means relatively

266
00:19:17.401 --> 00:19:21.270
not so either aggressive or running away and hiding.

267
00:19:22.620 --> 00:19:27.600
So she scores everyone of around four or 500 foxes twice,

268
00:19:27.601 --> 00:19:29.940
once when they're a pup,
once when they're an adult.

269
00:19:30.540 --> 00:19:35.540
And then she takes the 10% that had the 10% of the males and then the 10% of the

270
00:19:36.151 --> 00:19:39.150
females who had the highest aggregate score,

271
00:19:39.420 --> 00:19:44.080
the friendliest of the foxes,
the top 10% of the friend,
uh,

272
00:19:44.300 --> 00:19:48.390
10% friendliest foxes.
And she does this every year.

273
00:19:48.570 --> 00:19:51.630
Generation after generation

274
00:19:53.220 --> 00:19:57.810
initially would,
Mila describes these animals as fire breathing dragons.

275
00:19:57.990 --> 00:20:01.620
They're not technically wild foxes,
but they're pretty close to it.

276
00:20:01.621 --> 00:20:06.621
And most of them acted the way that you might expect foxes to act,

277
00:20:06.990 --> 00:20:08.370
especially if they are in a cage.

278
00:20:09.300 --> 00:20:14.300
But even after just two or three generations of selecting the calmest,

279
00:20:16.350 --> 00:20:18.060
[inaudible],
friendliest animals,

280
00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:22.140
there were a few and just a few foxes like Laska and Kesa.

281
00:20:22.230 --> 00:20:25.860
So you're looking at Lumea law holding Laska,
which means gentle.

282
00:20:26.490 --> 00:20:31.230
These animals were calm enough that Loomio could hold them in her arms.

283
00:20:31.260 --> 00:20:35.490
And so she held hope that if the experiment goes on long enough,

284
00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:39.360
they really will be able to find out some fundamental things about this process

285
00:20:39.361 --> 00:20:44.190
of domestication.
So she goes back year after year after year,

286
00:20:44.191 --> 00:20:45.210
four times a year,

287
00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:50.740
and does the same thing in 1965 she comes up with this classification system.

288
00:20:51.430 --> 00:20:54.820
She has what she calls class three foxes and these are animals that are either

289
00:20:54.821 --> 00:20:59.821
aggressive towards or are runaway and they never make the top 10% then there are

290
00:21:00.130 --> 00:21:04.780
Fox is like Laska and Kesa that are what she calls class two foxes.

291
00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:08.860
These animals can be held but they don't show any emotional response towards

292
00:21:08.861 --> 00:21:13.861
Lewd Mila and then there are class one foxes and these cannot only be held but

293
00:21:16.091 --> 00:21:18.100
they display friendly behavior.

294
00:21:18.250 --> 00:21:23.250
They wag their tails as lewd meal approaches and they wine and whimper when she

295
00:21:25.631 --> 00:21:30.130
leaves.
No training,
no teaching.
This is what they do.

296
00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:34.600
In 1965 class one fox is made up,

297
00:21:34.601 --> 00:21:38.860
maybe 2% of the Fox is today.
They make up 80% of the foxes.

298
00:21:39.010 --> 00:21:41.140
So all of that 10% that are being selected,

299
00:21:41.141 --> 00:21:46.141
they're all coming from class one and class two a year later with Mila has to

300
00:21:46.330 --> 00:21:51.330
expand this classification system to what she calls the class one e or the elite

301
00:21:51.550 --> 00:21:52.900
domesticated foxes.

302
00:21:53.020 --> 00:21:58.000
So here is a description of those foxes in lieu his own words.

303
00:21:58.690 --> 00:22:03.690
In the sixth generation there appeared pups who that eagerly sought out contact

304
00:22:04.631 --> 00:22:07.510
with humans not only tail wagging,
but wining,

305
00:22:07.511 --> 00:22:12.511
whimpering and licking our hands in a dog like manner.

306
00:22:15.550 --> 00:22:16.390
In addition,

307
00:22:17.050 --> 00:22:22.050
some of those elite domesticated foxes were not only wagging their tails,

308
00:22:23.740 --> 00:22:27.160
they were wagging their curly tales.

309
00:22:27.820 --> 00:22:29.740
Wild foxes don't have curly tails,

310
00:22:29.980 --> 00:22:34.810
but curly tells are a classic part of the Domestication Syndrome.

311
00:22:35.050 --> 00:22:39.310
It's the first of the domestication syndrome traits to appear in the foxes.

312
00:22:39.940 --> 00:22:44.200
Always keeping in mind that the only thing they use to determine who's going to

313
00:22:44.201 --> 00:22:47.170
breed is how friendly are they are towards humans.

314
00:22:47.380 --> 00:22:48.790
Whether you have a curly tail or not,

315
00:22:48.791 --> 00:22:53.470
does not affect whether you're a selected to breed only behavior and yet still

316
00:22:53.530 --> 00:22:57.670
here's the first of the domestication syndrome traits to appear.

317
00:22:57.910 --> 00:23:02.860
So a couple of years go by.
1967 now Lysenko was gone.
He's no longer a threat.

318
00:23:02.980 --> 00:23:07.690
Plus this is an important year because this is the year that the Fox farm and

319
00:23:07.691 --> 00:23:11.200
academic or doc is up and operating.

320
00:23:11.380 --> 00:23:16.190
This is what it looks like on a nice day in the Siberian winter.
Um,

321
00:23:16.210 --> 00:23:21.100
each one of these sheds holds maybe 50 foxes and at any given time there could

322
00:23:21.101 --> 00:23:25.420
be,
you know,
700 to a thousand foxes on the Fox farm.

323
00:23:25.810 --> 00:23:29.530
And this was a watershed moment because it changed the dynamics of the

324
00:23:29.531 --> 00:23:31.990
experiment in a couple of ways.
First of all,

325
00:23:31.991 --> 00:23:36.991
it meant that Lewd Mila and a team now could work with the foxes everyday,

326
00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:39.400
not just four times a year,

327
00:23:39.401 --> 00:23:42.610
even if it is a couple of weeks or a couple of months every day.

328
00:23:43.900 --> 00:23:47.390
The other thing that was really to look Mila was that when she was working down

329
00:23:47.391 --> 00:23:51.050
in less,
knew I was too busy to come visit very often,

330
00:23:51.051 --> 00:23:52.640
maybe once or twice a year.

331
00:23:52.641 --> 00:23:57.641
But now he's just 20 minutes away at the institute and he can come in,

332
00:23:59.031 --> 00:24:03.920
interact with the foxes anytime he wants and just as important if something

333
00:24:03.921 --> 00:24:05.300
major happens.

334
00:24:06.510 --> 00:24:06.770
<v 1>Okay.</v>

335
00:24:06.770 --> 00:24:11.690
<v 0>She can immediately get lay of over to see what's going on.</v>

336
00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:14.330
And one of those,
something important.

337
00:24:14.390 --> 00:24:18.680
One of those major things with this little guy right here,

338
00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:24.120
Macta or dream dream was the first of the domesticated foxes to have droopy

339
00:24:26.991 --> 00:24:28.550
floppy ears.

340
00:24:28.610 --> 00:24:33.610
So here's the deal about foxes and their ears in the Wild Fox

341
00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:35.341
is,

342
00:24:35.341 --> 00:24:39.700
do you have floppy ears still at about six weeks old and then they're your shoot

343
00:24:39.701 --> 00:24:43.330
ramrod straight the way that you might imagine a fox in the wild.
Well,

344
00:24:43.331 --> 00:24:46.900
at six weeks,
dreams ears were still floppy.
Two months they were still floppy.

345
00:24:47.020 --> 00:24:50.680
Three months they were still floppy.
Four months they were still floppy.
Lewd,

346
00:24:50.681 --> 00:24:54.700
Mila calls,
belief out there and believe,

347
00:24:54.880 --> 00:24:57.850
looks at dream,
turns around and asks Lewd Mila,

348
00:24:58.060 --> 00:25:03.060
what kind of wonder is this now they were seeing yet another trait in a

349
00:25:03.791 --> 00:25:07.570
domestication syndrome,
not only curly towels,
but floppy ears,

350
00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:12.070
all as the result of selection on behavior and behavior alone.
Ballet.

351
00:25:12.071 --> 00:25:15.400
I've used to take a slide of Maca to talks

352
00:25:17.290 --> 00:25:20.140
and when he would come back from these talks,
by this time,

353
00:25:20.141 --> 00:25:22.450
they were not only in the Soviet Union,
but all around the world.

354
00:25:23.380 --> 00:25:26.080
When he would come back,
he would tell the kneel on that.

355
00:25:26.080 --> 00:25:31.080
His colleagues would come up to him after the talk and accused him of trying to

356
00:25:31.481 --> 00:25:36.481
stick a picture of a dog puppy up on the screen to convince them that the Fox

357
00:25:36.671 --> 00:25:40.780
experiment was working.
That so much math to look like a dog.
Okay.

358
00:25:40.781 --> 00:25:44.330
So the experiment goes on year after year after year.
Right.

359
00:25:45.010 --> 00:25:48.070
And one of the things that live meal in a team have always been doing along the

360
00:25:48.071 --> 00:25:52.390
way is taking blood samples so that they can look for changes at the hormonal

361
00:25:52.391 --> 00:25:53.224
level.

362
00:25:53.320 --> 00:25:57.670
So by 1974 so about 15 generations into the experiment,

363
00:25:58.090 --> 00:26:03.090
what they're finding is that they're domesticated foxes have about a 50% lower

364
00:26:04.721 --> 00:26:08.920
level of stress hormones,
corticosteroids,
then wild foxes.

365
00:26:09.820 --> 00:26:13.780
What's more by this point,
they have started a control line in the experiment.

366
00:26:15.010 --> 00:26:18.250
So when the control line,
they test the Fox is exactly the same.

367
00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:19.300
But who gets to me,

368
00:26:19.301 --> 00:26:22.450
it has nothing to do with how friendly they are towards humans or aggressive.

369
00:26:22.451 --> 00:26:23.284
They are towards humans.

370
00:26:23.380 --> 00:26:27.490
So it's a nice control when they compare the domesticated foxes to the control.

371
00:26:27.491 --> 00:26:32.491
They also find that the domesticated Fox has had about 50% lower stress hormone

372
00:26:33.580 --> 00:26:34.413
levels,

373
00:26:34.690 --> 00:26:38.350
and they were also beginning to see all sorts of other things appear in their

374
00:26:38.351 --> 00:26:39.820
foxes.
By this time,

375
00:26:41.470 --> 00:26:46.470
domesticated pups by the mid seventies open their eyes on average a day earlier

376
00:26:48.150 --> 00:26:51.480
than the control foxes or wild foxes.

377
00:26:51.840 --> 00:26:56.840
Domesticated pups respond to sounds two days earlier than typical foxes.

378
00:26:59.910 --> 00:27:04.910
Females have a slightly extended reproductive season.

379
00:27:05.760 --> 00:27:09.900
Typically Wild Fox is breed for about 10 days in late January,

380
00:27:09.901 --> 00:27:13.420
early February.
Domesticated Fox's,

381
00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:18.180
particularly the elite domesticated Fox's were in breeding state for about 14

382
00:27:18.181 --> 00:27:20.970
days.
So a real difference,
not dramatic,

383
00:27:20.971 --> 00:27:25.020
but real difference yet another one of the traits and the domestication
syndrome.

384
00:27:25.021 --> 00:27:28.560
It's typical for domesticated species to have longer reproductive periods,

385
00:27:28.860 --> 00:27:33.150
then their wild ancestors.
And even you also see in domesticated species,

386
00:27:33.740 --> 00:27:37.170
um,
cases where wild,
the wild ancestor breeds once.

387
00:27:37.171 --> 00:27:40.380
But the domestic domesticated version breeds multiple times.

388
00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:44.100
Now they're beginning to see a slightly longer reproductive season.

389
00:27:44.310 --> 00:27:46.620
In the domesticated females.

390
00:27:46.830 --> 00:27:49.900
They were also beginning to see all sorts of strange things in their code

391
00:27:49.901 --> 00:27:54.720
coloration.
Another trait in a domestication syndrome in particular,

392
00:27:55.110 --> 00:28:00.110
there was this strange white star shaped pattern that was becoming more common

393
00:28:00.330 --> 00:28:04.080
on the foreheads of the elite domesticated foxes.

394
00:28:04.290 --> 00:28:06.600
And if any of you are horse fanatics,

395
00:28:06.601 --> 00:28:09.210
you know that there are breeds of horses where you see the same thing.

396
00:28:09.210 --> 00:28:10.440
And this is not uncommon,

397
00:28:10.441 --> 00:28:13.920
this strange star shaped white pattern on the far ahead.

398
00:28:13.921 --> 00:28:15.840
It's not uncommon and domesticated species.

399
00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:20.970
Now it's in the domesticated foxes and so on.

400
00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:24.030
Many,
many more changes by this time.

401
00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:29.460
So at this point they decide that they're going to expand the experiment even

402
00:28:29.461 --> 00:28:31.560
further.
So they've got this line,

403
00:28:31.590 --> 00:28:34.770
the domesticated align where they choose the 10% that are friendliest.

404
00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:38.730
They have a control line where they choose them regardless of how they behave

405
00:28:38.731 --> 00:28:39.300
towards humans.

406
00:28:39.300 --> 00:28:44.300
Now what they're going to do is have a third line where they choose the 10% that

407
00:28:45.181 --> 00:28:49.110
are most aggressive towards humans.

408
00:28:49.620 --> 00:28:52.500
Not because they're interested in aggression per se,

409
00:28:52.770 --> 00:28:56.430
but because they think that having this new part of the experiment,

410
00:28:56.431 --> 00:29:01.350
we'll let them understand their domesticated foxes better.
And He,

411
00:29:01.351 --> 00:29:03.510
and that can happen in lots of ways.
So for example,

412
00:29:03.511 --> 00:29:08.511
you could breed the foxes from the domesticated line with those from the

413
00:29:08.881 --> 00:29:13.770
aggressive line and when you study their pups you can get some hints about

414
00:29:13.771 --> 00:29:15.390
underlying genetic change.

415
00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:18.360
But I want to focus on another reason that they did this

416
00:29:19.860 --> 00:29:23.550
and that is that this whole experiment that we've been talking about,

417
00:29:23.790 --> 00:29:26.940
it's an experiment in behavior and it's an experiment in genetics.

418
00:29:27.450 --> 00:29:32.450
It's an experiment in behavioral genetics and anytime you do an experiment in

419
00:29:33.841 --> 00:29:37.080
behavioral genetics where what you're selecting on his behavior,

420
00:29:37.260 --> 00:29:40.110
you're always worried about something.
And that is,

421
00:29:40.230 --> 00:29:44.680
that may be non genetic factors are influencing your results.

422
00:29:44.830 --> 00:29:47.980
So over these 15 years we talked about all the things they've been finding in

423
00:29:47.981 --> 00:29:51.520
the foxes in their underlying assumption has been all of these things are due to

424
00:29:51.850 --> 00:29:56.050
changes at the genetic level but maybe non genetic factors are playing a role.

425
00:29:56.770 --> 00:30:01.770
Classic non genetic factors might be something like pups learn whether it be

426
00:30:01.990 --> 00:30:05.080
friendlier,
aggressive by watching their parents or other adults.

427
00:30:05.380 --> 00:30:07.270
Another classic non genetic factor.

428
00:30:07.271 --> 00:30:12.130
It would be the hormones that you're exposed to during development might

429
00:30:12.131 --> 00:30:15.460
influence whether or not you turn out to be aggressive or calm.

430
00:30:16.090 --> 00:30:21.090
And the only way to know whether these non genetic factors play a role is to

431
00:30:21.131 --> 00:30:22.330
design an experiment.

432
00:30:22.840 --> 00:30:26.410
This is often referred to as a transplant experiment,

433
00:30:26.710 --> 00:30:30.700
sometimes referred to as a common garden experiment except what we're going to

434
00:30:30.701 --> 00:30:31.211
be looking at.

435
00:30:31.211 --> 00:30:35.830
It's a common garden experiment where the garden is the uterus of a pregnant

436
00:30:35.950 --> 00:30:38.560
Fox.
So here's what Lewd Mila did.

437
00:30:40.270 --> 00:30:43.810
She had five or six pairs of females.

438
00:30:44.710 --> 00:30:49.710
Each pair was made up of an aggressive female and a tame domesticated female and

439
00:30:51.670 --> 00:30:54.310
both females were pregnant.

440
00:30:54.700 --> 00:30:58.540
And the transplant that's going to happen happens when there are about one week

441
00:30:58.541 --> 00:31:02.650
pregnant,
even though no one had ever tried this in an animal,
this big Neil,

442
00:31:02.700 --> 00:31:07.700
the learned the detailed surgical procedure so that she could swap developing

443
00:31:09.911 --> 00:31:13.840
embryos from one uterus to another.
So here's the developing,

444
00:31:13.870 --> 00:31:17.620
here's what the uterine Horn of a Fox looks like when they're pregnant and he,

445
00:31:17.621 --> 00:31:22.120
and you can see that they're caring about five,
six or seven developing embryos.

446
00:31:22.390 --> 00:31:26.680
What lewd meal the did was she took half of the developing embryos,

447
00:31:26.681 --> 00:31:31.681
one week old from the aggressive Fox and move them over to the uterus of the

448
00:31:32.111 --> 00:31:37.060
Tame Fox and took half of developing embryos from the team Fox and put them over

449
00:31:37.360 --> 00:31:40.390
in the aggressive Fox.

450
00:31:40.600 --> 00:31:45.600
This is the classic experiment you do to determine whether what you're seeing is

451
00:31:45.971 --> 00:31:48.250
due to genetic factors and non genetic factors.

452
00:31:48.280 --> 00:31:52.870
Because what you do is you wait about eight weeks in this case til the females

453
00:31:52.871 --> 00:31:55.870
give birth.
Then when the pups are up and moving around,

454
00:31:56.410 --> 00:32:01.410
what you do is you immediately see how they behave towards humans and you look

455
00:32:03.581 --> 00:32:08.581
to see do they behave like they're genetic mother regardless of what uterus they

456
00:32:10.421 --> 00:32:14.080
happen to be raised in.
If they do,

457
00:32:14.560 --> 00:32:18.010
that tells you that the changes you're looking at are genetic.

458
00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:21.010
If they behave like their foster mother,

459
00:32:21.310 --> 00:32:23.590
then that suggests non genetic factors might be a plate.

460
00:32:25.750 --> 00:32:28.930
So the Mila sets this up,
she's waiting,

461
00:32:29.080 --> 00:32:33.910
but of course she has a little bit of a problem and the problem is when she

462
00:32:33.911 --> 00:32:38.410
moves than one week old developing embryos from one uterus to another,

463
00:32:38.530 --> 00:32:39.650
she knows who's who.

464
00:32:40.550 --> 00:32:45.550
How is she going to know who is who when the females give birth?

465
00:32:46.010 --> 00:32:50.330
Fortunately she thought she thought about this and recognize this problem before

466
00:32:50.510 --> 00:32:51.560
she did the transplant.

467
00:32:52.430 --> 00:32:57.430
The foxes can provide you the answer to that question because Fox coat color is

468
00:32:59.871 --> 00:33:01.880
a very well understood genetic trait.

469
00:33:02.120 --> 00:33:05.960
That means that Luke Neela could color code the parents.

470
00:33:06.560 --> 00:33:11.270
So in some treatments the the domesticated female and male had like cut for a

471
00:33:11.271 --> 00:33:15.830
color and the aggressive pair had dark for a color in and others vice versa.

472
00:33:16.070 --> 00:33:21.070
And she then knew by the coat color of the pups who their genetic parents were.

473
00:33:22.040 --> 00:33:24.350
Okay.
So she's waiting and she's waiting.

474
00:33:24.950 --> 00:33:29.270
And at this point I just want to take a t tell you quickly about another group

475
00:33:29.271 --> 00:33:31.490
of people involved in this experiment.
The people that live,

476
00:33:31.491 --> 00:33:35.180
Mila and all the scientists referred to nicely as the workers.

477
00:33:35.420 --> 00:33:39.290
So anytime you have 700 foxes on a farm,
someone's got to feed them,

478
00:33:39.560 --> 00:33:41.690
change their cages,
make sure they're okay.

479
00:33:41.810 --> 00:33:43.340
These are the workers and they tend to,

480
00:33:43.400 --> 00:33:46.010
they tend to be poor women from local villages.

481
00:33:48.290 --> 00:33:51.680
They don't understand the details of this experiment,

482
00:33:51.890 --> 00:33:56.890
but they know that what's going on here is really important science.

483
00:33:56.901 --> 00:34:01.901
And they often go way above the call of duty to work with,

484
00:34:02.291 --> 00:34:02.930
with Mila.

485
00:34:02.930 --> 00:34:07.930
And it was the workers who first discovered the females giving birth.

486
00:34:08.210 --> 00:34:10.030
They ran two lewd meal,

487
00:34:10.031 --> 00:34:15.031
his office with cake and wine and had a giant party to celebrate it.

488
00:34:18.410 --> 00:34:19.960
So what did they find?

489
00:34:20.720 --> 00:34:25.720
I'm going to show you the results from one aggressive female who gave birth to a

490
00:34:26.571 --> 00:34:28.220
bunch of pups.
Okay.

491
00:34:29.240 --> 00:34:31.670
The results are very similar costs all females,

492
00:34:31.671 --> 00:34:34.160
but I'm going to let loose meal in her own words.
Tell you what she found.

493
00:34:36.710 --> 00:34:38.600
So the male says it was fascinating.

494
00:34:39.140 --> 00:34:43.160
The aggressive mother had both foster offspring and her genetic offspring.

495
00:34:43.161 --> 00:34:45.770
Of course,
that is exactly the way Lou Mila set up the experiment.

496
00:34:47.270 --> 00:34:51.170
Her foster team offspring were barely walking,

497
00:34:51.950 --> 00:34:53.690
but if there was a human standing by,

498
00:34:53.691 --> 00:34:58.691
they were already rushing to the cage doors wagging their tails and also licking

499
00:34:58.970 --> 00:35:02.780
her hands in Libya.
Biola continues.
She,

500
00:35:02.781 --> 00:35:07.670
the mother was punishing her foster tame offspring for such,

501
00:35:07.671 --> 00:35:11.480
I love this phrase,
improper behavior.
She growled at them,

502
00:35:12.230 --> 00:35:16.580
grab their necks,
threw them back into the corner of the cage,

503
00:35:16.700 --> 00:35:19.280
and what did those little pups do?
But get up,

504
00:35:19.700 --> 00:35:23.900
walk back over to the cage and start licking lewd meal.

505
00:35:23.901 --> 00:35:25.430
His hand again,

506
00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:30.860
they behaved exactly like their genetic mother,
not like their foster mother.

507
00:35:31.460 --> 00:35:34.580
Okay,
so the Medulla continues.

508
00:35:34.910 --> 00:35:39.180
Now she's going to look at the genetic offspring of the aggressive mother.

509
00:35:39.270 --> 00:35:43.710
What did they do?
And again,
I adore the ways that she describes this.

510
00:35:44.190 --> 00:35:46.770
They retain their dignity Groundling,

511
00:35:46.771 --> 00:35:51.450
aggressively the same as their mother and running to their nests.

512
00:35:51.600 --> 00:35:53.370
They behave like they're genetic mother.

513
00:35:54.060 --> 00:35:57.330
This was common for all the pups born true aggressive females.

514
00:35:57.360 --> 00:36:00.690
And it was also common to all the pups born to domesticate females.

515
00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:05.370
The pups behave like their genetic mother.
Okay,

516
00:36:05.460 --> 00:36:07.750
so the experiments going on and,
and,
and,

517
00:36:07.760 --> 00:36:10.190
and what's happening is happening even faster than Luke.

518
00:36:10.191 --> 00:36:13.590
Mila and Blake have dreamed it would.
So at this point,

519
00:36:13.860 --> 00:36:17.310
Lewd Mila goes to believe with an audacious idea.

520
00:36:18.660 --> 00:36:23.660
She says there's this tiny little house on the experimental Fox farm that's 700

521
00:36:23.821 --> 00:36:24.690
square feet or something.

522
00:36:25.140 --> 00:36:30.140
I want to move in there with one of the elite domesticated females and live with

523
00:36:32.190 --> 00:36:37.190
that individual 24 seven the way that we live with our dogs.

524
00:36:38.940 --> 00:36:43.830
More importantly,
the way that our ancestors lived with pro dogs.

525
00:36:44.880 --> 00:36:48.510
And I'm going to take notes on everything that happens and we can really see

526
00:36:48.511 --> 00:36:52.440
just how far down the path of domestication,
the Sox's of com.
Yes,

527
00:36:52.441 --> 00:36:54.060
it's only a sample size of one.

528
00:36:54.061 --> 00:36:58.470
It's an anecdote but maybe it'll teach us something important.

529
00:36:59.760 --> 00:37:04.530
So ballet of says I love it and Luke Mila has the perfect fox in mind.

530
00:37:04.830 --> 00:37:08.940
The Fox,
his name is pushing into which means tiny ball of fluff.

531
00:37:09.690 --> 00:37:14.130
And from the time that pushing go was three weeks old and walking around,

532
00:37:14.131 --> 00:37:18.510
she was the friendliest of all the elite domesticated foxes in the history of

533
00:37:18.511 --> 00:37:19.171
the experiment.

534
00:37:19.171 --> 00:37:24.171
And Lewd Mila knew she was the one but the meal decided she's gonna wait a year

535
00:37:24.690 --> 00:37:29.690
until push Inca is ready to breed at one year old and she breeds push Inca with

536
00:37:31.440 --> 00:37:32.880
a elite male.

537
00:37:33.300 --> 00:37:37.740
And now the idea is that she's going to move in with Pachinko right before

538
00:37:37.741 --> 00:37:41.190
pushing cause ready to give birth so she can take notes,

539
00:37:41.191 --> 00:37:44.670
not just on what push Inca does,
but what pups,

540
00:37:44.940 --> 00:37:48.300
who from the moment they're born are interacting with humans.

541
00:37:48.301 --> 00:37:51.240
The way that we interact with dog pups,
how they act.

542
00:37:53.220 --> 00:37:58.220
This is the only known picture we have of pushing ballet of petting her.

543
00:38:01.020 --> 00:38:03.870
This is what the experimental house looks like today.

544
00:38:04.680 --> 00:38:09.160
It still stands even though this experiment is in the mid 1970 [inaudible].

545
00:38:09.161 --> 00:38:12.180
But if you look inside today,
it's pure rubble.

546
00:38:13.380 --> 00:38:18.090
And the reason that I'm showing you two are rubble is that the first time that I

547
00:38:18.091 --> 00:38:23.091
visited in January of 2012 it was about minus 35 the snow was about up to here,

548
00:38:27.210 --> 00:38:31.140
[inaudible] about up to here.
And nevertheless,

549
00:38:31.200 --> 00:38:32.280
at 80 years old,

550
00:38:32.281 --> 00:38:37.281
she insisted upon taking me out to the house and giving me a room by room tour

551
00:38:38.050 --> 00:38:42.580
telling me this is where push Inca used to lie on the edge of my bed at night.

552
00:38:42.760 --> 00:38:46.300
This is where the pups used to play ball and so on and so on.

553
00:38:46.660 --> 00:38:51.660
So they moved in and on April six push Inca gave birth to her six pups,

554
00:38:53.470 --> 00:38:55.120
including this little guy Prue shock,

555
00:38:55.121 --> 00:38:57.880
which is the male version of tiny ball of fluff.

556
00:38:58.150 --> 00:39:00.430
And she took notes on everything that they did.

557
00:39:01.080 --> 00:39:04.270
And so this was April and they had been living together for about three months.

558
00:39:04.271 --> 00:39:07.720
So it's now July.
Now.
This picture comes from when I was there in the winter,

559
00:39:07.721 --> 00:39:11.110
but in the summer,
in July,
it's really hot in Siberia.

560
00:39:11.111 --> 00:39:12.520
You can get to be 90 degrees at night.

561
00:39:13.480 --> 00:39:16.360
And so what [inaudible] would do every evening is there on the other side of

562
00:39:16.361 --> 00:39:17.650
this house,
there's a little bench.

563
00:39:18.130 --> 00:39:22.480
And she would sit out there reading a book and like you might with your dog poo,

564
00:39:22.481 --> 00:39:25.110
Shingo would be lying by your side and we'd be able to it.

565
00:39:25.120 --> 00:39:27.160
We'd be reading and petting push income.

566
00:39:27.400 --> 00:39:30.160
And every evening around 7:00 PM or so,

567
00:39:30.490 --> 00:39:34.150
there was a guard that would come around the Fox farm just to make sure

568
00:39:34.151 --> 00:39:38.020
everything was okay.
And they had hired a new guard that nobody knew.

569
00:39:39.280 --> 00:39:44.090
And this guard on the night of July 15th was approaching with Mila and push

570
00:39:44.091 --> 00:39:47.710
Shanka and it sort of brisk way that maybe you might interpret as slightly

571
00:39:47.770 --> 00:39:48.603
aggressive.

572
00:39:49.570 --> 00:39:52.390
And Little Mila looked down at push Inca and she could not believe what was

573
00:39:52.391 --> 00:39:56.500
happening.
Push Inca had bolted up,

574
00:39:57.100 --> 00:40:02.100
charged towards the nightwatch person and began barking at them exactly the way

575
00:40:04.391 --> 00:40:09.391
that a guard dog wood and exactly like no Fox and the history of the experiment

576
00:40:09.431 --> 00:40:12.850
had ever barked
and would Neil,

577
00:40:12.851 --> 00:40:15.790
his first thought was pushing because protecting me.

578
00:40:16.600 --> 00:40:18.490
But then she stopped and said,
wait a minute,

579
00:40:19.240 --> 00:40:22.960
I know better than most how dangerous it is to fall into that trap to think that

580
00:40:23.020 --> 00:40:26.590
animals are behaving the way we would in that situation.

581
00:40:26.620 --> 00:40:27.880
But then something else happened,

582
00:40:28.750 --> 00:40:33.340
which was that Lumelleau low went over to the watch person and began talking to

583
00:40:33.341 --> 00:40:36.370
them in a very calm,
serene way.
And when push,

584
00:40:36.371 --> 00:40:40.060
because saw that she stopped barking,
walked back over to the bench,

585
00:40:40.780 --> 00:40:45.780
lay down and weighting weighted for Lewd Mila to come back and start reading.

586
00:40:47.590 --> 00:40:50.830
Is it possible push Inca wasn't protecting,
would Mila?

587
00:40:51.190 --> 00:40:52.600
Of course it's possible.

588
00:40:53.590 --> 00:40:57.700
But would Mila wanted to know with just how down far down the path of

589
00:40:57.701 --> 00:41:01.030
domestication these animals had come in?
Push Inca told her that.

590
00:41:01.330 --> 00:41:05.940
And because you are become responsible forever for what you have teamed.
Lewd.

591
00:41:05.950 --> 00:41:08.260
Mila will tell you from that night forward,

592
00:41:08.261 --> 00:41:12.010
she knew she would never leave the experiment and she never has.

593
00:41:12.280 --> 00:41:14.810
So let me just take five more minutes to quickly run you through some of the

594
00:41:14.811 --> 00:41:17.470
other incredible things that have gone on in this experiment.

595
00:41:17.650 --> 00:41:22.650
I mentioned before that in the 70s the reproductive season of the leaf

596
00:41:23.350 --> 00:41:26.230
domesticated animals had was slightly longer and other traits in the

597
00:41:26.231 --> 00:41:30.310
domestication syndrome in the early eighties something remarkable happened in

598
00:41:30.311 --> 00:41:33.530
about 84
a handful,

599
00:41:33.531 --> 00:41:38.531
maybe four or five of the elite domesticated foxes were ready to breed twice in

600
00:41:40.641 --> 00:41:45.050
a year.
Not only in the typical January,

601
00:41:45.051 --> 00:41:47.720
February time,
but a second time in September.

602
00:41:47.870 --> 00:41:51.590
Absolutely unheard of ever in foxes,

603
00:41:51.740 --> 00:41:56.150
but typical for domesticated animals,
Lewd Neil,
a bread,

604
00:41:56.370 --> 00:42:00.920
those handful of a lead females with a handful of elite males who would breed

605
00:42:00.921 --> 00:42:04.190
with them.
They produced a second clutch of pups.

606
00:42:04.520 --> 00:42:08.690
Think about how radical the change has to be a reproductive system to be able to

607
00:42:08.691 --> 00:42:10.640
go from breeding just once a year to twice a year,

608
00:42:10.910 --> 00:42:14.540
all as the result of selection on behavior and only behavior.

609
00:42:17.030 --> 00:42:19.970
By the eighties and nineties Luke Mila was working with people who have very

610
00:42:19.971 --> 00:42:24.320
sophisticated equipment that allowed her to measure the faces and bodies of the

611
00:42:24.321 --> 00:42:29.000
atom,
of her,
of her domesticated foxes.
And what she found was a couple of things.

612
00:42:29.001 --> 00:42:33.200
First of all,
the domesticated foxes have a rounder,

613
00:42:33.380 --> 00:42:37.820
shorter,
more doglike stout.
If you think of a fox in the wild,

614
00:42:37.821 --> 00:42:41.550
you think of this long pronounced now domesticated foxes more doglike,

615
00:42:41.560 --> 00:42:45.360
round short.
Another thing you might think of a domesticated foxes.

616
00:42:45.810 --> 00:42:47.780
Another thing you might think of of Wild Fox is,

617
00:42:48.080 --> 00:42:52.160
is they have these grass Cya Lynn's that they're running around on the

618
00:42:52.161 --> 00:42:57.161
domesticated foxes are chunkier and lower to the ground than wild foxes are.

619
00:43:00.290 --> 00:43:03.980
So as the experiment progresses and we get into the era of molecular genetics,

620
00:43:05.780 --> 00:43:07.040
they begin looking at these questions.

621
00:43:07.041 --> 00:43:10.430
And what happened was there was a geneticist by the name of Anna Kournikova,

622
00:43:10.900 --> 00:43:14.830
a Russian geneticists who had worked with dogs.
And she approached me,
Mila,

623
00:43:14.870 --> 00:43:19.070
because now that the tools for studying genetics and dogs are easily adaptable

624
00:43:19.071 --> 00:43:20.060
to foxes,
and she says,

625
00:43:20.480 --> 00:43:23.540
do you want to do some work trying to understand the underlying molecular

626
00:43:23.541 --> 00:43:26.810
genetic changes and what on a learned,

627
00:43:26.811 --> 00:43:29.690
which is what everybody learns when they work with leukemia,

628
00:43:29.691 --> 00:43:34.120
which is that if she thinks that you can help her better understand her

629
00:43:34.130 --> 00:43:36.620
domesticated Fox is she will not only work with you,

630
00:43:36.830 --> 00:43:39.980
she will work with you in a way that will make your head spin.

631
00:43:40.190 --> 00:43:43.940
And before she knew it,
Ana had hundreds of blood samples.

632
00:43:43.941 --> 00:43:48.740
It allowed them to start doing an analysis of the underlying molecular genetic

633
00:43:48.741 --> 00:43:52.220
changes that have occurred in their foxes.
And they've done this in many,

634
00:43:52.221 --> 00:43:56.960
many different ways.
I'm just going to show you one.
Okay.
An early study.

635
00:43:57.440 --> 00:43:59.540
So one of the first questions they asked was this.

636
00:44:01.270 --> 00:44:04.160
There were all these changes that have happened with a domesticated Fox is not

637
00:44:04.161 --> 00:44:07.850
only they're calmer,
but all the behave,
all the morphological changes.

638
00:44:07.851 --> 00:44:12.500
We talked about the floppy ears,
the cro hotels and so on.
The first question was,

639
00:44:12.501 --> 00:44:17.360
and a molecular genetic level,
are the genetic changes associated with that?

640
00:44:17.390 --> 00:44:22.040
Are they kind of spread all over the genome of the foxes or are they localized

641
00:44:22.041 --> 00:44:27.041
in sort of hotspots of genetic change associated with the domestication?

642
00:44:28.670 --> 00:44:31.200
What they found was many,
not all,

643
00:44:31.201 --> 00:44:36.201
but many of the changes in their domesticated foxes could be localized to one

644
00:44:36.751 --> 00:44:41.370
chromosome.
Fox chromosome number 12 that sort of interesting,
right?

645
00:44:41.371 --> 00:44:43.170
It's not spread all over the genome.

646
00:44:43.200 --> 00:44:47.040
It's in a hotspot or in one of a couple of hot spots.

647
00:44:47.310 --> 00:44:51.270
More interesting was that at the same time they were asking that question.

648
00:44:51.450 --> 00:44:54.960
A group of people were asking the same exact question and dogs,

649
00:44:58.500 --> 00:45:02.290
so dogs have more chromosomes than foxes,

650
00:45:02.340 --> 00:45:06.810
but Fox chromosome number 12 is essentially spread across bits of it are spread

651
00:45:06.811 --> 00:45:09.720
across three dog chromosomes.
For anyone who is a biologist.

652
00:45:09.721 --> 00:45:11.100
These are homologous chromosomes,

653
00:45:11.400 --> 00:45:16.400
but basically Fox chromosomes 12 is divided up into bits of it on to three dog

654
00:45:16.860 --> 00:45:18.810
chromosomes.
Lo and behold,

655
00:45:19.320 --> 00:45:22.440
one of those three dog chromosomes again,

656
00:45:22.560 --> 00:45:26.280
is a hotspot for domestication changes associated with domestication.

657
00:45:26.340 --> 00:45:28.920
So even deep down at the molecular genetic level,

658
00:45:29.550 --> 00:45:34.170
it looks like they're mimicking the process that happened with wills to dogs.

659
00:45:34.410 --> 00:45:36.730
Okay,
last gamble.

660
00:45:37.520 --> 00:45:42.520
I'm going to tell you about one trait that they have only found in the last 15

661
00:45:43.531 --> 00:45:43.891
years,

662
00:45:43.891 --> 00:45:48.000
and this may be my favorite of all the traits that the domesticated foxes have,

663
00:45:48.090 --> 00:45:51.030
but before I tell you what it is,
when I tell you why it's my favorite,

664
00:45:51.820 --> 00:45:53.580
it's a couple of reasons.
First of all,

665
00:45:53.820 --> 00:45:56.520
this trait did not appear until about 15 years ago,

666
00:45:56.760 --> 00:46:01.760
so that means the experiment was going on 45 years before this trade emerge,

667
00:46:02.910 --> 00:46:07.910
making it the poster child for why long term experiments are important.

668
00:46:09.870 --> 00:46:14.400
If any one of us had worked 30 years on a given biological system,

669
00:46:14.401 --> 00:46:18.000
we would sit back and start getting lifetime achievement awards and you would

670
00:46:18.001 --> 00:46:21.960
not have worked nearly long enough.
In a system for something like this.

671
00:46:22.440 --> 00:46:27.440
The second reason I love this trait is it's hard to imagine a more perfect trait

672
00:46:27.601 --> 00:46:32.310
for a domesticated pet like species to have than this.
So here's the story.

673
00:46:33.690 --> 00:46:38.010
In about two s the early two thousands woman by the name is fit Lana Gogal Lova

674
00:46:38.011 --> 00:46:42.930
approach leave me alone and Svetlana Studies,
animal communication.
And she said,

675
00:46:42.960 --> 00:46:44.930
I want to come there and I just,
I want to study the,

676
00:46:45.120 --> 00:46:48.750
the sounds that you're fox is make and I want to study it in the domesticated

677
00:46:48.751 --> 00:46:52.730
Fox is to control foxes and the aggressive foxes.
See what we might find lewd.

678
00:46:52.740 --> 00:46:56.580
Mila said,
great,
honest,
Svetlana started coming year after year,

679
00:46:56.581 --> 00:46:59.850
ended up with 2000 hours of tapes of the sounds,

680
00:46:59.851 --> 00:47:04.440
these Fox Smith and what she found was across all the foxes domesticated control

681
00:47:04.490 --> 00:47:08.580
and,
and and aggressive.
There are about eight different unique sounds they make.

682
00:47:09.300 --> 00:47:13.830
Most of those sounds are made by foxes in all the groups domesticated,

683
00:47:14.160 --> 00:47:17.010
control and aggressive.
But there were two,

684
00:47:17.011 --> 00:47:19.830
and I'm going to focus on one here that is only,

685
00:47:19.831 --> 00:47:23.190
that are only made by the domesticated foxes.

686
00:47:24.390 --> 00:47:26.400
And the one that we're going to hear in a second.

687
00:47:26.430 --> 00:47:29.200
This is only made by domesticated Fox.

688
00:47:29.620 --> 00:47:33.910
It's made by almost all of them,
and it's made from the their time,

689
00:47:33.911 --> 00:47:36.970
from the time that they start walking around.

690
00:47:37.240 --> 00:47:39.190
And this is what it sounds like,

691
00:47:44.750 --> 00:47:45.583
<v 2>right?</v>

692
00:47:49.160 --> 00:47:53.750
<v 0>There is no nonhuman sound that's closer to human laughter then that sound,</v>

693
00:47:53.960 --> 00:47:57.170
if you put it on a spectrogram and look at it and compare it to him and
laughter,

694
00:47:57.980 --> 00:48:00.800
there's no use,
there's no sound.
It's closer to human laughter and it's,

695
00:48:00.860 --> 00:48:03.080
it's almost too perfect,
right?
I mean,

696
00:48:03.170 --> 00:48:08.170
now you have an animal that is not only incredibly friendly and incredibly cute,

697
00:48:09.770 --> 00:48:13.760
but you have an animal that's going to laugh with you when you're laughing and

698
00:48:13.761 --> 00:48:16.820
it's going to laugh with you when you're angry and it's going to laugh with you

699
00:48:16.821 --> 00:48:20.210
when you're crying cause it doesn't care about any of that.
But nonetheless,

700
00:48:20.211 --> 00:48:22.700
it's making this perfect sound right?

701
00:48:22.940 --> 00:48:26.930
It's just what you'd want to have in a domesticated species.

702
00:48:28.370 --> 00:48:28.521
Okay.

703
00:48:28.521 --> 00:48:33.521
So if you talk to Mila 60 years after she began and continues to work on this

704
00:48:34.431 --> 00:48:37.490
experiment and you ask her about our hopes and the dreams for the future,

705
00:48:39.380 --> 00:48:42.350
what you'll get is you'll get a six hour answer,

706
00:48:42.351 --> 00:48:45.290
but I'll give you the quick version.
The first thing she'll tell you is,

707
00:48:45.291 --> 00:48:47.900
I hope it's possible to register them as a new pet species.

708
00:48:48.230 --> 00:48:52.010
So technically they are considered an exotic species.

709
00:48:52.400 --> 00:48:56.420
There are in fact a couple of dozen in people's houses across the United States

710
00:48:56.421 --> 00:48:57.170
in Europe,

711
00:48:57.170 --> 00:49:00.770
but because they're in and they're very expensive and all the money goes to the

712
00:49:00.771 --> 00:49:04.040
experiment,
but because they were an exotic species,

713
00:49:04.370 --> 00:49:07.490
the rules about whether you can have one of these very,

714
00:49:07.491 --> 00:49:10.760
not just from country to country and from state to state,

715
00:49:11.090 --> 00:49:13.850
but from city to city in subdivision to subdivision.

716
00:49:14.240 --> 00:49:18.160
Now there is an international panel that can,
um,

717
00:49:18.410 --> 00:49:19.940
assess whether an animal,

718
00:49:19.990 --> 00:49:24.110
it should be considered a house pet and they're working to get that

719
00:49:24.111 --> 00:49:27.620
classification.
Once they do,
then the Fox is,

720
00:49:27.621 --> 00:49:29.660
could go into any houses anywhere.

721
00:49:30.950 --> 00:49:35.540
And what Lunula envisions is they have plenty of foxes to keep the experiment

722
00:49:35.541 --> 00:49:39.800
going and also to put a few hundred into people's houses every year.

723
00:49:41.540 --> 00:49:43.430
The other thing that Luke,
Mila,

724
00:49:43.520 --> 00:49:48.520
we'll tell you about her hopes is one day I'll be gone,

725
00:49:49.490 --> 00:49:53.510
but I want my foxes and the experiment to live forever.

726
00:49:54.170 --> 00:49:55.003
I do.

727
00:49:55.190 --> 00:49:58.820
I hope you do and I appreciate you guys taking your lunch to hear this talk.

728
00:49:58.821 --> 00:49:59.690
Thanks very much.

729
00:50:06.070 --> 00:50:06.990
<v 2>Okay.</v>

730
00:50:11.430 --> 00:50:15.890
<v 0>In the anthropology classes,
you hear about this like nonstop,
so I'm curious.</v>

731
00:50:15.980 --> 00:50:19.310
Oh really?
You hear about this experiment?
Oh yeah.
Oh good.
That's good to know.

732
00:50:19.610 --> 00:50:23.960
That's part of the curriculum.
I'm wondering when you first heard about it all.

733
00:50:25.020 --> 00:50:28.580
Well,
you know,
because my own degree,
an evolutionary biology,

734
00:50:28.940 --> 00:50:31.070
I don't remember exactly when,

735
00:50:31.071 --> 00:50:34.760
but it must have been in one of my graduate classes because it is a very famous

736
00:50:34.761 --> 00:50:39.240
experiment.
Um,
I got involved in it.
Um,
you know,
uh,

737
00:50:39.320 --> 00:50:43.130
seriously about 10 years ago when I was looking for a,

738
00:50:43.160 --> 00:50:45.670
for a new history of science project,
um,

739
00:50:46.040 --> 00:50:50.420
I had done some work on Russian evolutionary biology.

740
00:50:50.421 --> 00:50:53.900
So I knew not only about some of the basics things they found.

741
00:50:53.901 --> 00:50:57.560
See the thing is a lot of people know a little bit about this experiment because

742
00:50:57.561 --> 00:51:01.400
95% of it is published in Russian.
So people know about floppy ears and stuff,

743
00:51:01.401 --> 00:51:04.040
but not a lot.
So I knew a little bit about the science and I thought,

744
00:51:04.041 --> 00:51:05.330
I know this is important science,

745
00:51:05.331 --> 00:51:09.770
but I also had a sense that Lysenko was involved.

746
00:51:09.771 --> 00:51:14.510
I had a sense that there were some really interesting human animal bonding

747
00:51:14.511 --> 00:51:17.830
stories and all of that.
So I approached with Neil about it and,
and,

748
00:51:17.890 --> 00:51:19.910
and she was keen on,
on doing something.

749
00:51:19.911 --> 00:51:22.640
So I'd say 10 years ago and it's been great.
I mean,

750
00:51:22.970 --> 00:51:26.720
we've meal and that whole group in Novosibirsk have become like family.
I mean,

751
00:51:26.780 --> 00:51:30.530
um,
and she,
you know,
I just emailed with her the other day and she's,

752
00:51:30.531 --> 00:51:33.080
she's doing four lane and she's still leading the experiment.

753
00:51:34.180 --> 00:51:37.690
<v 3>Yeah,
sure.
Thanks for the talk.
The foxes are adorable.
Um,</v>

754
00:51:37.691 --> 00:51:42.691
I'm curious if they try to control for researcher's bias,

755
00:51:44.700 --> 00:51:48.790
Mila favor animals that have the domestication.

756
00:51:49.060 --> 00:51:52.780
<v 0>Yup.
It's a great question.
Right?
And so,
um,</v>

757
00:51:52.781 --> 00:51:57.400
this is an inherent problem in this kind of experiment where you're going to

758
00:51:57.401 --> 00:51:58.630
gauge behavior.

759
00:51:59.170 --> 00:52:02.620
So I think that over the course of the experiment,

760
00:52:03.250 --> 00:52:06.250
they've gotten much better and tighter about this.
Initially.

761
00:52:06.280 --> 00:52:08.560
Like when I talked about that place less new I,

762
00:52:08.561 --> 00:52:11.260
it was really allude Mila and Lewd Mila alone.

763
00:52:11.920 --> 00:52:16.920
But once the experiment moved in 1967 to the experimental farm and there was a

764
00:52:17.171 --> 00:52:18.070
whole team of people,

765
00:52:18.280 --> 00:52:23.280
they began to do other things that really controlled as much as possible for

766
00:52:23.411 --> 00:52:25.570
what you're talking about.
Okay.
So first of all,

767
00:52:25.800 --> 00:52:29.050
the key thing they do is they've adopted techniques that come from psychology

768
00:52:29.051 --> 00:52:31.420
because psychologists have this problem all the time.

769
00:52:31.600 --> 00:52:34.660
You're measuring behavior and how do you know you're only using the,

770
00:52:34.690 --> 00:52:37.450
what you think you are maybe are being affected by other things.

771
00:52:37.690 --> 00:52:42.690
The classic way to do this is to have multiple different people independently

772
00:52:42.940 --> 00:52:45.670
assess whatever is being looked at.

773
00:52:45.671 --> 00:52:50.290
And then look for tight correlations across people in terms of who says the

774
00:52:50.291 --> 00:52:53.140
animals friendly and who isn't.
And that's what they do.

775
00:52:53.200 --> 00:52:57.460
Now the other thing that they do is that there's many,

776
00:52:57.461 --> 00:53:00.010
many components of behavior that they're looking for,

777
00:53:00.011 --> 00:53:04.060
not just the four things that Lewd Mila talked about early on.

778
00:53:04.270 --> 00:53:08.980
That's still the core of it is they're still looking for attributes of

779
00:53:08.981 --> 00:53:10.180
friendliness towards humans,

780
00:53:10.181 --> 00:53:13.870
but they sub divided that into dozens of different things.

781
00:53:13.871 --> 00:53:18.871
So that plus the multiple observers is the classic way to handle this problem.

782
00:53:19.601 --> 00:53:22.030
And they do the best they can with it.

783
00:53:22.740 --> 00:53:25.950
<v 3>Yeah.
Just a question.</v>

784
00:53:26.310 --> 00:53:27.600
<v 0>Okay.
Same question.
Okay.</v>

785
00:53:30.880 --> 00:53:34.360
<v 4>First of all,
thanks for the talk yet.
I was wondering in your words,</v>

786
00:53:34.361 --> 00:53:37.270
you said that this happened sort of like in the blink of an eye on an

787
00:53:37.330 --> 00:53:38.410
evolutionary scale,

788
00:53:38.650 --> 00:53:42.250
cause that's something inherent to foxes are like how quickly they reproduce or

789
00:53:42.550 --> 00:53:45.040
to some larger classification of animals.
And like if you,

790
00:53:45.090 --> 00:53:47.440
if you selected something from like a totally different,

791
00:53:48.310 --> 00:53:51.460
not related at all to foxes are wolves,
what would happen?

792
00:53:51.630 --> 00:53:55.720
<v 0>Yeah,
it's a great question.
Um,
and,
um,
we,</v>

793
00:53:55.770 --> 00:54:00.770
we know the answer to some extent because on the other side of the farm where

794
00:54:01.951 --> 00:54:05.670
the Fox is,
are,
are hundreds and hundreds of mink.

795
00:54:06.090 --> 00:54:07.830
And for the last 40 years,

796
00:54:08.190 --> 00:54:13.190
another person has been running the exact same protocol on mink and finding very

797
00:54:16.891 --> 00:54:20.360
parallel results.
So there's smaller animals,
so,
so the,
the,

798
00:54:20.490 --> 00:54:23.800
they're not quite as dramatic and sexy is what happens in the factors.

799
00:54:23.820 --> 00:54:26.580
But if you choose on behavior and behavior alone,

800
00:54:26.581 --> 00:54:30.630
and they'd done that both domesticated and aggressive,
like with the foxes,

801
00:54:30.930 --> 00:54:34.860
you not only get behavioral changes,
but you get changes in code,
coloration,

802
00:54:35.040 --> 00:54:39.990
hormone levels,
juvenile eyes,
facial patterns,
all of that same sort of stuff.

803
00:54:40.710 --> 00:54:41.543
I will tell you

804
00:54:43.350 --> 00:54:46.950
that as scary as the aggressive,

805
00:54:47.340 --> 00:54:51.100
the foxes that have been bred for aggression are the foxes that the,

806
00:54:51.120 --> 00:54:53.870
the minks that have been bred for aggression.
I,

807
00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:57.780
I still have nightmares walking by those cages.
I mean,
they're,
they're demonic.

808
00:54:57.810 --> 00:54:58.643
But,
um,

809
00:54:58.720 --> 00:55:03.720
and there's a third experiment that started with their group but then migrated

810
00:55:03.961 --> 00:55:07.740
to one of the Max Planck institutes in Germany where they're doing essentially

811
00:55:07.741 --> 00:55:10.230
the exact same thing in rats.
And again,

812
00:55:10.440 --> 00:55:12.870
smaller animals,

813
00:55:12.900 --> 00:55:16.950
so not as dramatic but seem basic results,
select on behavior you get,

814
00:55:16.951 --> 00:55:20.640
not just changes in the behavior but the morphological at atomical hormonal

815
00:55:20.641 --> 00:55:21.474
change

816
00:55:21.840 --> 00:55:26.310
<v 4>like uh,
the number of generations.
Was it sort of like a similar timeline?</v>

817
00:55:27.280 --> 00:55:31.360
<v 0>Yeah,
I mean,
so the mink to breed once a year,
uh,
and I,</v>

818
00:55:31.361 --> 00:55:35.740
I think they are beginning to see serious changes within a couple of dozen

819
00:55:35.741 --> 00:55:39.610
generations,
like the foxes.
Now you have to remember also that this is,

820
00:55:40.440 --> 00:55:44.470
I mean it,
it's hard to say anything about sort of the,
um,

821
00:55:44.560 --> 00:55:48.610
the absolute amount of time and how important that is in the domestication

822
00:55:48.611 --> 00:55:53.611
process in the wild only because this is really super intense selection.

823
00:55:54.110 --> 00:55:58.000
You know,
you're just choosing the top 10%,
you know,
in evolutionary history,

824
00:55:58.001 --> 00:56:00.820
our ancestors would not have been doing that kind of thing.

825
00:56:00.850 --> 00:56:04.750
And initially it would have been non con unconscious selection,
you know,

826
00:56:04.751 --> 00:56:08.320
just sort of the ones that can closest we're the ones that were friendliest and

827
00:56:08.321 --> 00:56:10.030
so on.
And then when they started doing consciously,

828
00:56:10.031 --> 00:56:14.140
it would not have been to the intensity that we're talking about here.
Sure.

829
00:56:16.470 --> 00:56:21.470
<v 4>So one thing that you kept bringing up in this presentation is stop the specific</v>

830
00:56:21.631 --> 00:56:24.700
domesticated behaviors of foxes,
uh,

831
00:56:24.850 --> 00:56:28.130
acquire our dog like behaviors.

832
00:56:28.410 --> 00:56:33.220
And I know that there is some relationship,
I'm not sure how close it is,

833
00:56:33.250 --> 00:56:38.250
but are there differences between the two that's still persist in?

834
00:56:39.101 --> 00:56:40.060
Is there,

835
00:56:40.450 --> 00:56:45.340
how close are they really after domestication in this form?

836
00:56:45.950 --> 00:56:49.280
<v 0>Well,
I guess I can answer that in a couple of different levels.</v>

837
00:56:49.281 --> 00:56:52.990
First there they're both canines,
right?
So they haven't ever loot.

838
00:56:52.991 --> 00:56:55.370
They have a shared evolutionary history,
but they,
their,

839
00:56:55.371 --> 00:56:58.730
their most recent common ancestor was on the order of 12 million years ago.

840
00:56:58.731 --> 00:57:00.020
But they're,
but they're all canines.

841
00:57:00.920 --> 00:57:05.090
I use the language of their behavior is very dog,
like as a,

842
00:57:05.091 --> 00:57:08.900
as a way to sort of put it in context,
meaning they lick hands,

843
00:57:08.901 --> 00:57:11.810
they wag towels and so on.
Um,

844
00:57:11.811 --> 00:57:16.420
in that sense they are very doglike,
but um,

845
00:57:16.430 --> 00:57:18.650
in many,
many other ways,
they are not.

846
00:57:18.651 --> 00:57:23.630
So they are not animals that are inherently gregarious.
They don't necessarily,

847
00:57:23.690 --> 00:57:27.560
you know,
they're,
they're not animals that like to live in groups.
There are many,

848
00:57:27.561 --> 00:57:31.970
many differences between the domesticated foxes and dogs,

849
00:57:31.971 --> 00:57:35.690
but there are a tremendous number of similarities that seem to be due to

850
00:57:35.780 --> 00:57:40.460
choosing for this,
this prosocial behavior.
I mean,

851
00:57:40.520 --> 00:57:43.000
um,
you know,
at the genetic level,
you,
uh,

852
00:57:43.280 --> 00:57:47.360
although the underlying changes like we talked about have been similar that,

853
00:57:47.420 --> 00:57:49.580
you know,
you couldn't breed them or anything like that.
Right?

854
00:57:50.110 --> 00:57:53.560
<v 4>Yeah.
I guess I don't want to hold up,</v>

855
00:57:53.710 --> 00:57:57.850
but I would have also asked how far away are we from speciation?

856
00:57:58.050 --> 00:58:03.030
<v 0>Yeah,
that's a good question.
And the answer is very far.
I think there's no,</v>

857
00:58:03.031 --> 00:58:03.811
so the,
the,

858
00:58:03.811 --> 00:58:08.280
the aggressive foxes and the domesticated foxes can breed perfectly well.

859
00:58:08.281 --> 00:58:10.740
They do it all the time to understand the underlying genetics.

860
00:58:11.130 --> 00:58:15.930
They've never attempted anything with Wild Fox is because they're terrified of

861
00:58:15.931 --> 00:58:18.030
introducing rabies and all this sort of thing.

862
00:58:18.031 --> 00:58:20.910
But there's no reason in the world to think that they wouldn't read perfectly

863
00:58:20.911 --> 00:58:25.070
well with Wild Fox is so,
so,
so far.
Um,

864
00:58:25.180 --> 00:58:29.970
there's not reproductive barriers,
but again,
this is 60 years,
which is nothing.

865
00:58:30.180 --> 00:58:34.770
If they ran the experiment for another 500 years,
would there be differences?

866
00:58:34.800 --> 00:58:38.220
Maybe even that's a small amount of evolutionary time,
but,
but you know,

867
00:58:38.280 --> 00:58:40.380
we don't know.
Right.
Thank you.
You're welcome.

868
00:58:43.070 --> 00:58:44.040
<v 4>Hi.
Um,</v>

869
00:58:44.360 --> 00:58:48.020
I was wondering what the lifespan of the foxes are and if it changed when they

870
00:58:48.021 --> 00:58:48.920
were domesticated.

871
00:58:49.430 --> 00:58:51.410
<v 0>Another good question.
So believe it or not,</v>

872
00:58:51.411 --> 00:58:56.411
we don't know a tremendous amount about the lifespan of wild foxes.

873
00:58:58.060 --> 00:59:01.040
Um,
people estimated at maybe,
you know,

874
00:59:01.041 --> 00:59:04.330
on average two or three years,
uh,
the,

875
00:59:04.520 --> 00:59:08.600
all the foxes on the Fox farm can live six,

876
00:59:08.601 --> 00:59:12.710
seven years now.
But in terms of differences,

877
00:59:13.280 --> 00:59:17.920
there are no differences between the domesticated animals and the,
uh,

878
00:59:17.990 --> 00:59:21.710
the domesticated line,
the aggressive line and control.

879
00:59:21.711 --> 00:59:26.450
And so one of the changes has not been longer lifespan.

880
00:59:26.660 --> 00:59:28.760
They have slightly more offspring,
but,

881
00:59:28.761 --> 00:59:31.820
but not longer lifespan per se.

882
00:59:33.790 --> 00:59:35.610
<v 4>Yes.
Hi.
Hi.
Um,</v>

883
00:59:36.490 --> 00:59:40.900
of course this experiments has never run for,
uh,
humans.
Oh,

884
00:59:40.901 --> 00:59:44.350
I'm glad you're going to ask what you're going to ask.
Go ahead.
I mean,

885
00:59:44.351 --> 00:59:46.090
once you dedicate your whole life,

886
00:59:46.091 --> 00:59:49.330
I'm sure she had some great observations on humans.

887
00:59:49.480 --> 00:59:54.460
I wonder if she ever exchange any stories with you or any observations.

888
00:59:54.461 --> 00:59:55.670
So we,
we,
we do

889
00:59:55.920 --> 00:59:59.310
<v 0>about this a little bit in the book I went,
so here's the short version.</v>

890
01:00:01.480 --> 01:00:05.400
Um,
in the late seventies,

891
01:00:05.401 --> 01:00:08.040
belaying her mentor and the person who basically,
you know,

892
01:00:08.041 --> 01:00:11.700
was her goto person on this,
on this experiment,

893
01:00:12.130 --> 01:00:17.130
Belay IV hypothesize that human evolution was an example of self domestication.

894
01:00:19.920 --> 01:00:22.410
And the self domestication idea is this

895
01:00:24.270 --> 01:00:29.270
instead of some external force choosing the animals that are friendliest or

896
01:00:31.201 --> 01:00:35.580
comest in self domestication that happens by mate choice.

897
01:00:35.610 --> 01:00:38.280
So the idea was in evolutionary history,

898
01:00:38.520 --> 01:00:42.330
both males and females would have been more likely to choose calmer,

899
01:00:42.331 --> 01:00:46.680
more cooperative mates,
right?
For all sorts of reasons.
First of all,

900
01:00:47.190 --> 01:00:51.870
interpersonal aggression would be minimized and also things that require

901
01:00:51.871 --> 01:00:54.540
cooperation would have been maximized.

902
01:00:54.990 --> 01:00:58.940
And the argument then is that by doing that,
by selecting the calmest,

903
01:00:58.941 --> 01:01:00.900
friendliest animal,
uh,
mates,

904
01:01:01.050 --> 01:01:04.020
you are in fact mimicking the process of domestication.

905
01:01:04.021 --> 01:01:05.580
It's just self domestication.

906
01:01:05.820 --> 01:01:09.030
This was an idea that ballet I've had in the late seventies didn't really do a

907
01:01:09.031 --> 01:01:12.960
lot with it.
Just in the last three months.

908
01:01:13.770 --> 01:01:14.700
Richard Wrangham,

909
01:01:15.060 --> 01:01:19.920
a colleague of mine at Harvard has an entire book out on human self

910
01:01:19.921 --> 01:01:24.921
domestication and now there's evidence from all different fields to suggest that

911
01:01:26.190 --> 01:01:30.600
we may very well be the product of domestic self domestication.

912
01:01:30.601 --> 01:01:33.570
And the evidence comes in lots of different forms,

913
01:01:33.630 --> 01:01:37.260
one of which is that if you compare,

914
01:01:39.300 --> 01:01:42.750
if you compare it to wrap up please.
I got it.
Okay.

915
01:01:44.610 --> 01:01:48.000
I'm ready to stop anytime you guys are.
I use a,
you have to tell me when to stop.

916
01:01:48.060 --> 01:01:50.180
Um,
uh,
um,
uh,

917
01:01:50.730 --> 01:01:55.730
so one of the forums is that if you compare us to our closest living relatives,

918
01:01:56.970 --> 01:01:58.410
meaning chimpanzees,

919
01:01:59.100 --> 01:02:04.100
we tend to show traits that are more in the domestication syndrome than

920
01:02:04.381 --> 01:02:09.060
chimpanzees do,
right?
We show we have longer reproductive periods,

921
01:02:09.061 --> 01:02:10.740
we have lower stress hormone levels,

922
01:02:10.920 --> 01:02:15.920
we have many juvenile ISED feature is compared to chimpanzees there.

923
01:02:16.441 --> 01:02:20.310
And there are many other forms of evidence that to that we have self

924
01:02:20.311 --> 01:02:23.430
domesticated ourselves.
Um,
I would suggest if you're interested,

925
01:02:23.730 --> 01:02:28.560
the book Richard's book is called the goodness paradox,

926
01:02:28.860 --> 01:02:31.140
and it just came out.
It's getting a lot of attention on,

927
01:02:31.141 --> 01:02:34.830
you can easily find it on Amazon when you search for my book.
So there you go.

928
01:02:35.730 --> 01:02:36.450
Thank you very much.
