1
00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:10.650
Very delighted to have the writer and director of the film screenagers uh,

2
00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:12.650
Dr. Delaney Ruston.
So let's welcome her

3
00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:21.050
Delaney.
Tell us about just the,
what the film was about and uh,

4
00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:22.190
where you got this idea from.

5
00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.880
<v 2>Sure.
We'll screenagers,
uh,</v>

6
00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:30.030
is a film that looks at my personal story and stories of all different age

7
00:00:30.311 --> 00:00:35.080
groups about the impact of all this screen time on kids.

8
00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:40.420
And you know,
really as a physician,
I was interested in this,

9
00:00:40.421 --> 00:00:45.421
but most importantly as a mom with two young teenagers who wanted more and more

10
00:00:45.641 --> 00:00:49.960
screen time,
I was really figuring out like,
oh,
what do I do?

11
00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:55.290
Feeling really out of control and often is the case when I feel this way is I

12
00:00:55.661 --> 00:01:00.661
started filming and now here we are with screenagers out for almost a year now.

13
00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:08.860
And it is just creating a huge movement and I'm really excited about that and

14
00:01:08.861 --> 00:01:10.140
excited to be here at Google talking.
Yeah.

15
00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.440
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

16
00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.190
What has been the response from parents and even from some kids are teenagers as

17
00:01:14.191 --> 00:01:15.024
you've shown this to?

18
00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.921
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

19
00:01:15.921 --> 00:01:20.921
I mean parents really want solutions and so I really made sure that the film was

20
00:01:21.951 --> 00:01:22.401
about that.

21
00:01:22.401 --> 00:01:26.150
And what I really wanted to do is get people talking because it was interesting.

22
00:01:26.151 --> 00:01:29.990
I had been doing films on mental health issues and I did one for example on

23
00:01:29.991 --> 00:01:31.100
global mental health.

24
00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:35.360
Trying to find people in China and India to talk about mental illness is not

25
00:01:35.361 --> 00:01:36.194
easy.

26
00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:41.290
I came back here trying to find parents to talk about struggles in their home

27
00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:46.390
was so much harder and I realized how private parenting is and so I wanted the

28
00:01:47.571 --> 00:01:52.040
film to be shown in communities and get kids,

29
00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:53.750
parents,
teachers,

30
00:01:53.751 --> 00:01:57.110
all of us talking about how are we going to manage this for our kids,

31
00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:00.950
how are we going to get them to manage it?
And the response has been,

32
00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:05.550
that's great.
I brought my kid,
we had a great talk.
We're still talking.
Um,

33
00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:09.530
educators are talking now with their kids about these issues more.

34
00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:14.330
So that's been great.
Kids really like the science,
which has been fun.

35
00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.440
Sometimes they're defensive and then it's a great conversation to have with
them.

36
00:02:18.441 --> 00:02:20.210
You know,
what did this bring up with you?
You know,

37
00:02:20.211 --> 00:02:24.380
what our appropriate screen time limits.
So it's been across the board,

38
00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:29.390
critical in making discussions happen and that's really what my goal was.

39
00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:33.710
<v 0>Well it's a phenomenal film.
And seeing it and seeing it,
it's very funny.</v>

40
00:02:33.711 --> 00:02:37.600
We were laughing at the,
I came in a group is laughing a few times during the,

41
00:02:37.601 --> 00:02:42.030
the,
the screening.
I was laughing.
Uh,
what was so interesting was,
Whoa,

42
00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.400
I guess what were some of the surprises that you've found is that I've gone to

43
00:02:44.401 --> 00:02:47.210
last present myself just from listening to be like,
Oh wow,
okay.
That's,

44
00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:48.140
that hits the nail on the head.

45
00:02:48.141 --> 00:02:50.300
But what were some of the surprises that you found that you may not have known

46
00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:51.081
before?

47
00:02:51.081 --> 00:02:54.770
Just outside of your own child that your own experience with your own child that

48
00:02:54.771 --> 00:02:55.660
other parents were expecting?

49
00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:57.710
<v 2>Okay.
Well.
Um,
you know,</v>

50
00:02:57.711 --> 00:03:01.500
first I have to say when my daughter saw the film for the first time,
um,

51
00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:06.310
he's in the film here I was,
I had been making it for you know,
a couple of years.

52
00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:10.540
And the first reaction was I don't realize other kids were dealing with all

53
00:03:10.541 --> 00:03:15.280
these issues around rules or not.
I'm like,
Tessa,
what did we get?
Oh yes.

54
00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:17.920
The only one who he was.
And you know,

55
00:03:17.921 --> 00:03:21.950
I think parents often feel that way too and we don't,

56
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.910
it's particularly interesting that parents feel self conscious about talking

57
00:03:24.911 --> 00:03:27.880
about solutions.
You know,
you do hear parents saying I'm struggling,

58
00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:32.590
but in terms of kind of saying what kind of rules they've tried and haven't

59
00:03:32.591 --> 00:03:36.640
tried,
you feel really judged.
And that's kind of the con,

60
00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:38.650
that's what I really wanted to say.
We got to get out there.

61
00:03:38.651 --> 00:03:43.651
We've got to be talking about how do we decide when tech should be put away and

62
00:03:44.291 --> 00:03:45.430
in what spaces.

63
00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:50.790
And that's not necessarily easy to do when it is so dopamine rich.

64
00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:55.720
And to answer your question in terms of we know surprises that I found looking

65
00:03:55.721 --> 00:03:58.830
at the science was first and foremost that there,

66
00:03:58.831 --> 00:04:03.831
there's no other age in our life then our teenage years when our pleasure center

67
00:04:05.081 --> 00:04:10.000
is physically the biggest that you have the most dopamine there at any time.

68
00:04:10.001 --> 00:04:13.780
So it wasn't that it was our first time kiss that it was so great.

69
00:04:13.781 --> 00:04:16.720
It was actually that we were like pumping dopamine at that time.

70
00:04:16.721 --> 00:04:21.721
And so what the kids' experiences are and their vulnerability to that intense

71
00:04:23.201 --> 00:04:27.580
dopamine rushes from some of the most fascinating video games and all sorts of

72
00:04:27.581 --> 00:04:29.290
things.
You know,

73
00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:33.700
that's what we really have to be aware of and be responsible about,
you know,

74
00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:38.260
stepping up to the challenge that we can create balance around this.

75
00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:41.600
<v 0>Well,
what,
what is it,
how'd you do it with your daughter when you look at,
I mean,</v>

76
00:04:41.601 --> 00:04:45.230
you can't with this contract and that was really funny or you made baseless four

77
00:04:45.231 --> 00:04:49.470
or five page contracts for her.
And so,
but what does that balance when you have,

78
00:04:49.471 --> 00:04:53.120
because it was interesting what you asked your daughter was,
um,
you know,

79
00:04:53.121 --> 00:04:55.910
why do you want a phone?
Convince me why you need this smartphone,

80
00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:57.200
why you need this iPhone or whatever.

81
00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:02.060
And she has all my friends have it and everyone has it.
So I mean,

82
00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:07.070
as a parent,
how do you say no to a kid when everyone else is doing it?
You know,

83
00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:08.150
because at that age is just,

84
00:05:08.151 --> 00:05:11.240
it doesn't matter what their parents say just matters.
Everyone else is doing it.

85
00:05:11.241 --> 00:05:11.960
So I should be like,

86
00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:14.330
<v 2>yeah,
I,
you know,
it's interesting,</v>

87
00:05:14.331 --> 00:05:18.170
one of the movements that we've started with a film is called Tech Talk Tuesday.

88
00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:23.770
And it's exactly about having these kinds of conversations that are easy to not

89
00:05:24.351 --> 00:05:28.850
have to do because you're just busy and you just have a reactive answer,

90
00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:32.360
you know?
Well,
I don't care if everyone is doing right.
So tech talk Tuesday,

91
00:05:32.361 --> 00:05:36.020
every week we give discussion prompts to as part of the solution,

92
00:05:36.021 --> 00:05:40.490
how to have these conversations.
And actually today's tech talk Tuesday,

93
00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:45.080
um,
on the screenagers movie website is exactly that age.
Well,

94
00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:49.600
that question of what age is appropriate to get a kid at a mobile device,

95
00:05:49.601 --> 00:05:54.590
a smartphone.
And,
um,
there's a,
there's a lot of discussion about it.

96
00:05:54.591 --> 00:05:59.000
What I've seen over making this film is of course kids at and younger ages are

97
00:05:59.001 --> 00:06:02.390
getting smartphones.
One recent survey,

98
00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:06.200
7% of four year olds on their own smart phone,

99
00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:09.830
75% of four year olds own their own mobile device.

100
00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:14.420
A lot of those or some sort of like a iPad.
So,
you know,

101
00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:19.010
if we don't stop and have these discussions about what do we do,
you know,

102
00:06:19.011 --> 00:06:19.371
there's a,

103
00:06:19.371 --> 00:06:23.150
there's a big trend that we all see happening and I don't know if we're always

104
00:06:23.151 --> 00:06:24.560
going to get this right.
You know,

105
00:06:24.561 --> 00:06:28.610
when your kid asked this and ask that and you're kind of coming up with what you

106
00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:30.710
feel.
I think there's two things.

107
00:06:30.711 --> 00:06:34.100
I think we have a lot more data now in the past 10 years,

108
00:06:34.101 --> 00:06:38.750
so we need to be data driven,
you know,
definitely this is emotional.

109
00:06:38.751 --> 00:06:41.690
So it's,
you know,
emotionally fueled.
It's our kids,

110
00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:46.990
but it should be data driven and I think that when we do that we're going to

111
00:06:47.831 --> 00:06:52.831
parent with integrity and that's what we'll look back and feel good about rather

112
00:06:53.781 --> 00:06:58.250
than it's too late.
Nothing I can do.
It's actually not too late.

113
00:06:58.251 --> 00:07:03.251
If you have a teenager and there have devices in their bedroom and you look at

114
00:07:04.101 --> 00:07:09.101
the study that shows much more convincingly how poor sleep affects emotional

115
00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:15.260
development,
academic development,
you might say,
Hey,

116
00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:17.540
I know you've been pretty good.
You've had your phone there.

117
00:07:17.541 --> 00:07:19.700
I know you put it on the other side of the room or it's silent,

118
00:07:19.701 --> 00:07:23.720
but I'm just going to feel better because self control goes down when we're

119
00:07:23.721 --> 00:07:26.810
tired.
All these things,
let's talk about the science,

120
00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:30.320
but I think we need to all have our devices out of the bedroom.

121
00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:35.420
That's an example of having these kinds of conversations,
doing them commonly,

122
00:07:35.421 --> 00:07:40.010
weekly Tech Talk Tuesday and kids actually really respect that.

123
00:07:40.011 --> 00:07:44.180
You're modeling to them that you're going to do this with integrity and there

124
00:07:44.290 --> 00:07:45.800
might be frustrated in the beginning,

125
00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:50.720
but actually they'll feel the difference and they'll be happy that you did that.

126
00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:53.270
Is your son getting off a little bit easier than your daughter?

127
00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:55.710
Cause she's kind of taking the brunt of it,
right?
Cause she,
yeah,

128
00:07:55.900 --> 00:07:59.120
13 I guess when you did this whole contract,
it's interesting that you say that.

129
00:07:59.121 --> 00:07:59.470
So my,

130
00:07:59.470 --> 00:08:04.470
my son's a senior now in high school and I really was kind of thinking this

131
00:08:04.701 --> 00:08:08.000
issue of,
oh he's an older teenager,
you know,
what can I do now?
It's his,

132
00:08:08.001 --> 00:08:10.580
and I notice he just was,
when we were in the kitchen,

133
00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:14.720
kind of as he was moving around,
just a lot more on his phone.
And I said,

134
00:08:14.721 --> 00:08:17.930
and it was just snuck up on us and I said,
you know what's going on?

135
00:08:17.931 --> 00:08:22.040
It seems like you're really kind of always on.
And he said,
he's said,
wow,

136
00:08:22.041 --> 00:08:22.874
you know,
you're right.

137
00:08:22.910 --> 00:08:26.990
And he went off his phone for a week just to kind of see how that felt.

138
00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:30.830
There was some frustrating times where he couldn't get directions or you know,

139
00:08:30.831 --> 00:08:34.310
some things and we had to talk about,
okay,
how are you going to preempt that?

140
00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:37.370
And he said it's helped him to reset.

141
00:08:37.670 --> 00:08:41.630
So it was a good reminder to me that all of us kind of need the,

142
00:08:41.690 --> 00:08:43.940
sometimes just a little poke and a little thing.

143
00:08:43.941 --> 00:08:48.860
And it's ultimately the goal though is really to get our kids to have that

144
00:08:48.861 --> 00:08:53.861
mindfulness that they can experiment with this because it truly is just a daily

145
00:08:55.140 --> 00:09:00.140
experiment about how do we live to our fullest when we have lots of things that

146
00:09:01.741 --> 00:09:03.960
we want to do online and offline.
Yeah.

147
00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:07.230
<v 3>Um,
all right,
so gonna open up the ions questions.
Uh,</v>

148
00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:10.970
so one thing I've heard about anecdotally is a teenager's having a lot more

149
00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:14.000
ergonomic problems like in the wrist and neck.
And they used to,

150
00:09:14.210 --> 00:09:17.600
I was curious if you ran across any of that in your investigations.

151
00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:22.280
<v 2>Yeah,
I mean that absolutely posture and other,
um,
uh,</v>

152
00:09:22.281 --> 00:09:27.080
some tendinitis things are,
you know,
happening more.
It's,
it's not,

153
00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:31.400
um,
also near sightedness is a discussion.
We don't have the definitive,

154
00:09:31.401 --> 00:09:35.270
but absolutely anybody can be prone and get,
it's not,
you know,

155
00:09:35.271 --> 00:09:37.910
how much increased risk that is per person.

156
00:09:38.780 --> 00:09:42.530
It's hard to say because there's so many genetic and other factors going in.

157
00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:45.440
But with the different game devices in particular,

158
00:09:45.470 --> 00:09:50.470
you have some kids who were playing games six hours a day and some of them are

159
00:09:50.631 --> 00:09:53.810
prone to having pain in those regions.

160
00:09:54.790 --> 00:09:58.660
<v 4>Obviously the movie focused on teenagers,
but I'm wondering,
you know,</v>

161
00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:03.370
younger kids are just as much into technology and they don't have the ability to

162
00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:08.590
be rational,
you know,
to sort of understand datadriven um,

163
00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:12.880
you know,
uh,
explanation.
So what advice do you have on younger kids?

164
00:10:12.881 --> 00:10:14.860
I have a four year old nephew who,
you know,

165
00:10:14.861 --> 00:10:18.400
had a temper tantrum when the iPad was taken away.
So what can you,
you know,

166
00:10:18.430 --> 00:10:21.420
we as parents do to deal with the younger kids and technology [inaudible]

167
00:10:22.590 --> 00:10:23.430
<v 2>um,
you know,</v>

168
00:10:23.431 --> 00:10:28.431
I think there's a lot of discussion about how we set parameters and have kids'

169
00:10:28.621 --> 00:10:31.770
involvement.
And I think even at a young age,

170
00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:34.590
that is reasonable and a great approach.

171
00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:37.560
And so even in that setting,
you know,

172
00:10:37.710 --> 00:10:42.300
would it be more helpful if I gave you 10 minutes or five minute warning before

173
00:10:42.301 --> 00:10:46.410
your screen time is over?
And that will go a long way.

174
00:10:46.411 --> 00:10:48.660
And that made them feel like they're involved.

175
00:10:48.870 --> 00:10:53.670
But absolutely they might cry and say,
no rule ever work here.

176
00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:56.070
And it's a question of,
you know,

177
00:10:56.130 --> 00:11:00.360
doing that kind of work now versus paying a lot more later.

178
00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:06.150
And I'll give you an example or the same study I mentioned earlier with young

179
00:11:06.151 --> 00:11:06.631
kids.

180
00:11:06.631 --> 00:11:11.631
It turns out that 25% of those parents are using devices for kids to go to bed

181
00:11:12.541 --> 00:11:17.541
width and over half of them are using devices when they are shopping or want to

182
00:11:18.691 --> 00:11:19.950
get things done right.

183
00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:24.090
Particularly also obviously when a kid is upset.

184
00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:28.380
So one concern is that are we training them when they're uncomfortable,

185
00:11:28.381 --> 00:11:33.381
when they're upset to go to a screen as opposed to self soothe,

186
00:11:34.100 --> 00:11:37.170
talk to a friend,
exercise,
other things,
you know,

187
00:11:37.171 --> 00:11:41.430
we're really giving that dopamine quick screen right away.

188
00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:46.760
And what I mean by pay later is that as it gets stronger and bigger and if

189
00:11:46.861 --> 00:11:51.210
they're really prone to this affinity,

190
00:11:51.690 --> 00:11:54.160
it can be a lot bigger later on.

191
00:11:54.730 --> 00:11:59.290
So we do have a lot on screenagers movie.com about addressing the different
ages.

192
00:11:59.590 --> 00:12:00.730
And I'd say,
you know,
I'm just,

193
00:12:00.790 --> 00:12:04.630
I'm so fascinated as a physician and all of us as individuals here,

194
00:12:04.631 --> 00:12:09.220
we know that certain people have strong reactions to um,

195
00:12:09.550 --> 00:12:14.410
pleasurable stimuli.
It's just a known thing.
I do not like wine wine at all,

196
00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:19.420
but I know a lot of you must really like wine,
right?
I love sugar to the,

197
00:12:19.630 --> 00:12:20.463
like,

198
00:12:21.070 --> 00:12:25.840
I can't even put words my husband sugar could totally live without it.

199
00:12:25.841 --> 00:12:27.100
Right.
And I,
and it's really,

200
00:12:27.101 --> 00:12:31.000
there's a same thing going on for a lot of people with,
with screens,

201
00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:35.290
with video games,
whatever the different things are prone to.
And as a parent,

202
00:12:35.291 --> 00:12:39.190
I would just say to have a real wake up call in terms of if there's a pattern

203
00:12:39.191 --> 00:12:43.390
where they're having really extreme withdrawal feelings and fighting and

204
00:12:43.391 --> 00:12:47.230
aggression around screen time being turned off,

205
00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:49.870
it's a good time to say,
okay,
you know,

206
00:12:49.871 --> 00:12:53.770
I need to get really mindful about this and how are we going to manage this?

207
00:12:53.771 --> 00:12:55.690
I need to read about this,

208
00:12:55.691 --> 00:12:59.410
I need to talk to others and it's going to go a long way.

209
00:13:00.020 --> 00:13:03.460
<v 0>We see that in the film with a single mother who has a child and she was a</v>

210
00:13:03.461 --> 00:13:04.294
single,

211
00:13:04.490 --> 00:13:06.170
<v 2>yeah,
grandmother,
right?</v>

212
00:13:06.470 --> 00:13:09.410
<v 0>Yeah.
Who had the kid who she just like,
he just loves his video games,</v>

213
00:13:09.411 --> 00:13:10.730
particularly where he punched the wall,

214
00:13:10.731 --> 00:13:13.510
kicks the law and stuff like that and just like,
no,
and Helen,

215
00:13:13.610 --> 00:13:14.730
it's interesting kind of thing.

216
00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:19.530
<v 2>One of my favorite parts in the movie is when she goes to see that super cool</v>

217
00:13:19.590 --> 00:13:24.120
social worker counselor.
Because again,
as a physician that,
you know,

218
00:13:24.150 --> 00:13:27.210
I work with a ton of counselors because you know,

219
00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:31.320
the way that we may frame and the outside help is so critical that I really

220
00:13:31.321 --> 00:13:33.310
wanted to put that in there.
And I don't think,
you know,

221
00:13:33.340 --> 00:13:37.300
I think we really need a movement.
Uh,
Lisa and I,
my,
um,

222
00:13:37.310 --> 00:13:41.020
coproducer is here with me today.
I'm so happy about that.
Um,
we're,

223
00:13:41.021 --> 00:13:44.520
we're talking about today,
we really need a crisis line.
Um,
you know,

224
00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:48.420
restart where you saw that deals with kids who really do have addiction issues

225
00:13:48.421 --> 00:13:51.000
around screen time.
They get flooded with calls,

226
00:13:51.450 --> 00:13:55.560
but it doesn't even have to be that high a level.
But I,

227
00:13:55.620 --> 00:13:59.280
I have people now call me a lot and I do kind of,
you know,

228
00:13:59.490 --> 00:14:02.340
impromptu ongoing counseling for them,

229
00:14:02.341 --> 00:14:07.050
brainstorming and helping them to get new ways of thinking and approaching this

230
00:14:07.051 --> 00:14:09.600
because it's intensive,
you know,

231
00:14:09.601 --> 00:14:14.601
30% of families in America report that they are struggling daily about screen

232
00:14:15.961 --> 00:14:20.130
time with their kids.
It's happened.
It's also you don't an opportunity.
Yeah.

233
00:14:20.220 --> 00:14:25.080
It's like if we can use us that opportunity of how we're going to have

234
00:14:25.650 --> 00:14:27.390
resolution of conflicts,

235
00:14:27.930 --> 00:14:32.250
that's going to go a long way to teach them in their work,

236
00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:33.660
in the relationships.

237
00:14:33.870 --> 00:14:38.280
It's the number one thing that predicts for relationships is not how many cool

238
00:14:38.281 --> 00:14:41.160
things you guys do together or mountain biking and Moran,

239
00:14:41.610 --> 00:14:43.440
but how you resolve conflicts.

240
00:14:43.950 --> 00:14:48.950
And so learning how to do that with small frequent conversations with really I

241
00:14:51.470 --> 00:14:56.470
take really pinning yourself down what are a few times that we don't think that

242
00:14:57.020 --> 00:15:01.070
tech should be used so that our relationships can be stronger.

243
00:15:02.060 --> 00:15:07.060
Why is it that 70% of parents allow kids to use devices in the car when that can

244
00:15:08.601 --> 00:15:11.210
be really valuable time.

245
00:15:11.510 --> 00:15:16.340
Like let's wake up and say sorry,
it's not safe.
It's not great.

246
00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:19.190
Let's,
let's listen to music together.
Let's be together.

247
00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:23.320
There are these kinds of discussions we're having about rethinking how are we

248
00:15:23.330 --> 00:15:25.370
going to create these cherished moments.

249
00:15:25.830 --> 00:15:28.080
<v 0>Interesting too.
Cause like it's,
I'm trying to,</v>

250
00:15:28.470 --> 00:15:31.450
it's seeing the kids be so attached to their screens and,

251
00:15:31.451 --> 00:15:34.380
and go right to the video game and try to be immersed in these worlds using,

252
00:15:34.410 --> 00:15:35.243
cause when I was a kid,

253
00:15:35.430 --> 00:15:39.450
when we were kids we would go play and the forest and we would have to pretend

254
00:15:39.451 --> 00:15:42.270
like we were the Ninja turtles or we were the power rangers or whatever,

255
00:15:42.271 --> 00:15:44.670
you know,
and like how do you,

256
00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:47.850
how would you suggest a parent going after that or going about that with their

257
00:15:47.851 --> 00:15:49.260
child saying,
you know,

258
00:15:49.380 --> 00:15:52.630
there is a world out there and just in your head and you can actually pretend in

259
00:15:52.631 --> 00:15:55.790
play out there versus just having to immerse yourself into world

260
00:15:55.900 --> 00:15:57.990
<v 2>or craft or Minecraft or this,
you know,</v>

261
00:15:58.210 --> 00:16:03.040
I think that it gets you a bigger question of why do we care that kids not just

262
00:16:03.041 --> 00:16:07.460
beyond screens all the time.
And you know,
as a parent,
as we're,

263
00:16:07.540 --> 00:16:10.690
I think that's really important that we think about where our kids are at more

264
00:16:10.691 --> 00:16:14.850
as a mentor teacher and where we want to make sure that they get to,

265
00:16:14.851 --> 00:16:19.540
to offline experiences.
And I break it down into three main things.

266
00:16:19.660 --> 00:16:24.010
Creativity,
communication and competency.

267
00:16:24.850 --> 00:16:28.330
And what's really interesting about what you're saying about creativity,

268
00:16:28.331 --> 00:16:33.310
like create with your mind and be out there in the world is it turns out when

269
00:16:33.311 --> 00:16:36.490
they survey what kids are doing on screens,

270
00:16:36.730 --> 00:16:40.210
only 3% of the time is content creation.

271
00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:44.350
It's pretty amazing.
You know,
when they're,
you,
you can make videos,

272
00:16:44.351 --> 00:16:46.420
you can make music,
you can write blogs.

273
00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:50.710
And frankly,
um,
you know,

274
00:16:50.711 --> 00:16:54.880
the reason is to create and to,

275
00:16:54.940 --> 00:16:58.600
to work,
uh,
is much harder than to play and to watch.

276
00:16:58.900 --> 00:17:03.340
And so our brain often will default.
Even though doing that work,

277
00:17:03.341 --> 00:17:07.120
you actually feel better afterwards and longer and you gain,
you know,

278
00:17:07.121 --> 00:17:09.490
self confidence from what we do.

279
00:17:10.360 --> 00:17:15.100
So I think that if your kid is not spending a fair amount of time doing mental

280
00:17:15.101 --> 00:17:19.400
creation or other creation as one of those things,
creation,
communication,
and,

281
00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:23.560
and a competency,
I think that's a great starting point to say,
Hey,

282
00:17:23.561 --> 00:17:27.180
I want to make sure you're also creating offline.
You know,

283
00:17:27.190 --> 00:17:30.130
and having time to think with your brain and write it down.

284
00:17:30.460 --> 00:17:34.360
And also let's relook at what you're doing online.
You're in this game,

285
00:17:34.361 --> 00:17:38.230
that fabulous.
Hey,
there's this program by which you could develop a game.

286
00:17:39.130 --> 00:17:43.270
So I think having that,
that mindset can really be effective.

287
00:17:44.070 --> 00:17:47.540
<v 0>So thank you very much.
That was really amazing.</v>

288
00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:50.130
I guess probably a wake up call

289
00:17:50.130 --> 00:17:54.690
<v 5>for many people.
Um,
so I have two questions.</v>

290
00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:59.520
First question.
Um,
it seems that you also touched on the,

291
00:17:59.580 --> 00:18:04.380
uh,
digital identity part and how we believe in how we help kids.

292
00:18:04.910 --> 00:18:08.470
Uh,
personally I found really brave that you put your family,

293
00:18:08.660 --> 00:18:13.020
your own family in that movie and I would like to discuss that.
How did you,

294
00:18:13.380 --> 00:18:17.850
what was the process of deciding how many of those scenes and how much of your

295
00:18:17.851 --> 00:18:22.590
family you should expose to the world?
And I assume this movie goes really,

296
00:18:22.591 --> 00:18:25.850
really well,
which I really hope and a wish,
eh,

297
00:18:26.370 --> 00:18:30.300
your kids will probably become celebrities through this movie.
So how,

298
00:18:30.301 --> 00:18:35.301
how do you weigh these thing of doing something for the world that is really

299
00:18:36.961 --> 00:18:41.840
meaningful?
Vestors uh,
introducing risks to your own family.
You will,
man.

300
00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:43.490
<v 2>Well,
you know,
I have to say,</v>

301
00:18:43.491 --> 00:18:47.960
I wasn't at all intending to put my family into this film.
I thought it was,

302
00:18:47.961 --> 00:18:48.351
you know,

303
00:18:48.351 --> 00:18:52.580
just looking at video games and social media and I didn't think it called for

304
00:18:52.581 --> 00:18:52.761
that,

305
00:18:52.761 --> 00:18:56.840
but it actually was because it was hard for me to find families who would let me

306
00:18:56.841 --> 00:19:01.100
in in real time.
Again,
I think that we create,

307
00:19:01.190 --> 00:19:06.020
we totally crazy eve,
um,
true real moments,
you know,
we,

308
00:19:06.021 --> 00:19:10.880
and even reality TV is so we now we see it as so doctored.
So,

309
00:19:10.940 --> 00:19:11.773
um,

310
00:19:11.930 --> 00:19:16.930
that's ultimately my kids had been used to my filming in the home for so long

311
00:19:17.420 --> 00:19:20.300
and we didn't know what the film would be calm.
They didn't know.

312
00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:23.120
Fortunately since mainly it's my daughter,

313
00:19:23.121 --> 00:19:28.121
she has been okay and happy with the film and she does a lot of the Q and A's

314
00:19:28.251 --> 00:19:33.170
with me.
Um,
she has moments when she sees the parts in there and she's like,
oh.

315
00:19:33.171 --> 00:19:37.520
And recently this last week I tried to film her on some emotional stuff that's

316
00:19:37.521 --> 00:19:40.940
happening and she's 15 and she said,
I don't know.

317
00:19:40.970 --> 00:19:44.300
I don't know if I want to be filmed their mom.
I'm,
I'm happy now.

318
00:19:44.301 --> 00:19:48.570
It's great about screenagers.
I'm just not sure.
So it'll be interesting to,

319
00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:53.420
to see.
Um,
I think though getting,
you know,
it'd be,

320
00:19:53.450 --> 00:19:55.040
it would be great if everyone did this.

321
00:19:55.041 --> 00:19:59.510
Have your kids film you about what do you think you were struggling with,

322
00:19:59.540 --> 00:20:02.840
with balance and screen time and film them?
I mean,
there's a,

323
00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:04.880
there's an incredible,
um,

324
00:20:04.910 --> 00:20:08.180
we use it a lot of medicine to see how we communicate as physicians,
right?

325
00:20:08.181 --> 00:20:12.920
We filmed the medical students and then we evaluate that and everyone can be

326
00:20:12.921 --> 00:20:15.440
creating and have that self reflection again,

327
00:20:15.441 --> 00:20:18.560
anything that we can do to make our kids more mindful,

328
00:20:18.830 --> 00:20:23.830
more curious about all of this as opposed to just immediately pulled in.

329
00:20:24.290 --> 00:20:26.750
We're doing half our battle.
It really are.

330
00:20:27.050 --> 00:20:31.940
<v 5>How can we make the most out of this treasure?
And whether it means,
first of all,</v>

331
00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:35.270
I would hope is that it will not become a,

332
00:20:35.271 --> 00:20:37.790
like a compulsory screening.

333
00:20:37.791 --> 00:20:42.791
But at least through this movement we go far away and like 60,

334
00:20:43.071 --> 00:20:48.040
70,
90% of students,
teenagers,
students,
the u s will,

335
00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:52.720
uh,
be able to watch it with our parents.
Uh,
hopefully,

336
00:20:52.721 --> 00:20:55.450
perhaps the regulators also,
we'll have a chance,

337
00:20:55.451 --> 00:21:00.080
I don't know if we can have a screening at the congress or something,
but,
uh,

338
00:21:00.420 --> 00:21:02.000
uh,
so if you could,

339
00:21:02.050 --> 00:21:05.740
if you could talk a little bit more how we could take this movement and move it

340
00:21:05.741 --> 00:21:08.250
along.
And also one more for rob,

341
00:21:08.980 --> 00:21:13.980
if you could have a follow up to that movement to see how actually having seen

342
00:21:15.161 --> 00:21:20.030
the movement has affected the families and uh,
the,
uh,
you know,

343
00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:21.033
I witness,

344
00:21:21.180 --> 00:21:23.850
<v 2>so to answer your first question about how to build this movement,</v>

345
00:21:23.851 --> 00:21:28.410
how do we get all families and kids to see this movie because it's a one hour of

346
00:21:28.411 --> 00:21:33.411
their life and yet screentime is somewhere around seven hours a day for kids and

347
00:21:35.281 --> 00:21:38.160
adults,
not including school work.
And not including work,
you know,

348
00:21:38.161 --> 00:21:41.160
it's an incredible,
so with this one hour to get us to think,

349
00:21:41.161 --> 00:21:43.740
what do we agree with?
What do we don't,
what does the science,

350
00:21:43.741 --> 00:21:47.490
what science do we need?
We are all for it.
We have,

351
00:21:47.491 --> 00:21:50.970
I'm now almost 2000 screenings that are scheduled,
you know,

352
00:21:50.971 --> 00:21:55.830
that had been booked around the country and in about 20 different countries.
Um,

353
00:21:55.860 --> 00:22:00.480
and we're working with many different companies who have brought it,
you know,

354
00:22:00.550 --> 00:22:01.110
um,

355
00:22:01.110 --> 00:22:05.610
Pixar and Lucas films and a lot of tech companies and all over.

356
00:22:06.420 --> 00:22:11.130
And we really,
but we really believe that it is about bringing people together.

357
00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:15.360
And so@screenagersmovie.com anyone can bring it to their church,

358
00:22:15.361 --> 00:22:18.600
to their afterschool activity program.
So please,
you know,

359
00:22:18.601 --> 00:22:22.680
I think that all of you help us and getting the word out to bring it to schools

360
00:22:22.710 --> 00:22:27.120
and whatnot.
And the other thing that everyone can do today is that tech talk.

361
00:22:27.121 --> 00:22:31.050
Tuesday,
we're next week will be our 50th week of doing it.

362
00:22:31.350 --> 00:22:34.560
If you take a pledge to do one of them on our website,
it's,

363
00:22:34.580 --> 00:22:36.600
it's basically saying to your kids,
Hey,

364
00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:41.710
I want to take a pledge to not be reactive.
I,
he,

365
00:22:41.730 --> 00:22:44.880
what I always do is I do the grab and stab.

366
00:22:44.910 --> 00:22:48.930
I like grab my daughter's phone and then I kind of like staring her in the eyes,

367
00:22:48.931 --> 00:22:53.010
like I told you not to be on it.
Then.
And through doing these tech talk,
Tuesdays,

368
00:22:53.011 --> 00:22:54.030
calm conversations,

369
00:22:54.031 --> 00:22:59.031
I really become less reactive and more curious and an able to deal with that.

370
00:22:59.041 --> 00:23:02.550
So I hope people will do the tech talk Tuesday pledge.
Um,

371
00:23:02.551 --> 00:23:06.730
in terms of a followup movie,
you know,
something just a couple of weeks ago,
um,

372
00:23:06.930 --> 00:23:11.930
the today show had a group of teenagers that they showed the film to and then

373
00:23:12.571 --> 00:23:17.571
they had them give up their phone and technology for a week and they saw what

374
00:23:18.361 --> 00:23:23.290
happened.
So it's at our website and it's fun to watch,
but that,
so we'll,

375
00:23:23.291 --> 00:23:27.330
we'll see what the next film full feature film will be.
Yeah.

376
00:23:27.690 --> 00:23:28.470
<v 6>Um,</v>

377
00:23:28.470 --> 00:23:33.420
so this is a really funny like timing in terms of the screening because actually

378
00:23:33.750 --> 00:23:37.260
I'm a very recent like teenager myself and I also,
uh,

379
00:23:37.261 --> 00:23:41.940
for the past month I've given up like social media just to basically disconnect,

380
00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:45.440
uh,
what was mentioned in a movie.
Like we are hooked and addicted,

381
00:23:45.441 --> 00:23:50.441
but a lot of us have that yearning to not be an and to not be like I'm

382
00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:55.000
controlled by what we feel like is,
I'm very addicting.
Uh,

383
00:23:55.070 --> 00:23:58.880
so I just want to say first of all,
this is such a great film and uh,

384
00:23:58.881 --> 00:24:01.700
really touched upon a lot of very relatable experiences.

385
00:24:01.701 --> 00:24:05.750
I'm already like being on social media,
I'm so much more productive at work.

386
00:24:06.710 --> 00:24:11.510
I'm actually doing things that I enjoy outside of just like mindlessly
scrolling.

387
00:24:11.950 --> 00:24:14.690
Um,
I think when like,

388
00:24:15.290 --> 00:24:18.170
I don't know if you've thought about this or have the answer,

389
00:24:18.171 --> 00:24:21.070
but something I'm just thinking about is the term,

390
00:24:21.140 --> 00:24:23.240
the condition of the screen.

391
00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:28.240
So like obviously if we have screens it's very distracting and something we can

392
00:24:28.251 --> 00:24:32.120
look at.
And you know,
wherever you go,
the cafe,
the bus,
like everywhere,

393
00:24:32.121 --> 00:24:33.740
everyone is just looking down on the screens.

394
00:24:34.190 --> 00:24:37.880
But more and more people now are saying that the future of tech is a very

395
00:24:37.881 --> 00:24:42.710
quickly becoming screamed less.
Um,
and the Google home,
you know,
Alexa,

396
00:24:42.711 --> 00:24:46.370
like all those things,
um,
the watch and,
or I guess the wash is a screen,

397
00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:48.190
but you go to,
I mean,
right.
Um,

398
00:24:48.380 --> 00:24:53.380
so do you think that the problem lies in the screen itself or is there something

399
00:24:54.350 --> 00:24:58.100
just about technology?
Um,
that is the real challenge?

400
00:24:58.210 --> 00:24:58.630
<v 2>Well,
you know,</v>

401
00:24:58.630 --> 00:25:02.860
I think you've really hit on something that is key is what you did is you

402
00:25:02.861 --> 00:25:04.570
replaced it right?

403
00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:08.110
And as a physician that it works in primary care,

404
00:25:08.380 --> 00:25:11.890
half of what I do is behavior change.
And it's not okay,

405
00:25:11.891 --> 00:25:13.660
you gotta Stop Smoking cigarettes.

406
00:25:14.190 --> 00:25:17.920
It's what are we going to do in place of that urge when you have it right.

407
00:25:17.980 --> 00:25:20.260
It never works to replace with a vacuum.

408
00:25:20.261 --> 00:25:24.940
So fantastic that you are doing other things that you're excited about.

409
00:25:25.240 --> 00:25:25.630
Um,

410
00:25:25.630 --> 00:25:29.200
I would say that the other thing that I'm excited that you're talking about is

411
00:25:29.201 --> 00:25:30.370
that you're modeling,
right?

412
00:25:30.371 --> 00:25:34.660
You are here in the cafe and you're probably having a better conversation or

413
00:25:34.661 --> 00:25:38.020
you're just being breathing.
I know you do a lot of mindfulness stuff.

414
00:25:38.021 --> 00:25:43.021
You're taking that moment to kind of refresh your brain and that modeling is a

415
00:25:43.110 --> 00:25:44.520
key.
It turns out that,
uh,

416
00:25:44.521 --> 00:25:48.280
I just learned that 80% of parents think they actually are good models.

417
00:25:48.700 --> 00:25:51.970
If you are highly educated,
you were more likely to think that.

418
00:25:52.390 --> 00:25:56.380
And I think it's in part because we justify I have to do it for work,
you know,

419
00:25:56.381 --> 00:25:57.640
and kids,
well,
it's different.

420
00:25:58.180 --> 00:26:03.070
We need to figure out how to model in terms of change.
Like one behavior.
Like,

421
00:26:03.071 --> 00:26:04.900
you know what?
I'm going to work,
I'm going to say to my kids,

422
00:26:04.901 --> 00:26:08.230
I really am checking too much during dinner and I'm going to say to them,

423
00:26:08.231 --> 00:26:12.970
I'm going to work on this guys.
Help me.
You know,
because to change behavior,

424
00:26:12.971 --> 00:26:17.650
it takes a lot of different issues.
Again on the screenagers movie site.

425
00:26:17.651 --> 00:26:20.800
I spent a lot of time on that because you made it seem easy,

426
00:26:20.801 --> 00:26:23.140
but it's often not so easy.

427
00:26:23.950 --> 00:26:27.910
Your real question though is in terms of screen time,
is it the screen?

428
00:26:27.911 --> 00:26:28.744
What is it?

429
00:26:29.020 --> 00:26:33.160
I think a big thing that we have to know is that our brain does not like to be

430
00:26:33.161 --> 00:26:34.930
bored.
Right.

431
00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:38.500
And I don't know if you just saw the study that came out in science magazine

432
00:26:38.501 --> 00:26:42.160
when they put people into a room with nothing to do for 15 minutes,

433
00:26:42.940 --> 00:26:46.240
over a quarter of them had the um,

434
00:26:46.380 --> 00:26:49.950
chose to give themselves an electric shock rather than just sit there.

435
00:26:49.980 --> 00:26:54.000
Even though prior they had paid experimental money to not be shocked.

436
00:26:54.150 --> 00:26:55.260
They didn't like the shock.

437
00:26:55.290 --> 00:26:59.070
It was just being bored and sitting there was nerve wracking.

438
00:26:59.250 --> 00:27:03.660
And when we give kids now these devices in the car,

439
00:27:04.110 --> 00:27:07.080
the car has so much cool things driving by.

440
00:27:07.140 --> 00:27:11.250
If that's not kind of like cool to be like thinking and daydreaming,

441
00:27:11.251 --> 00:27:12.660
have the music,
whatever.

442
00:27:13.140 --> 00:27:17.220
We're really setting them up to be more and comfortable having those moments

443
00:27:17.490 --> 00:27:21.930
where there's boredom and then our brain,
ideally we'll find new ideas to go to.

444
00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:25.560
Right.
Cause I'm bored and brilliant as a whole concept that look,

445
00:27:25.590 --> 00:27:28.200
a lot of creativity comes from those moments,

446
00:27:28.530 --> 00:27:32.910
but in the moment and the immediacy,
we get scared of those moments.
Well,

447
00:27:32.970 --> 00:27:34.680
thank you so much for being here,
doctor of the lane.
