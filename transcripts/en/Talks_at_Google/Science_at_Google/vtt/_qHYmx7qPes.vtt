1
00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:12.130
Awesome.
Hey everyone,
thank you all for coming through.

2
00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:17.410
Really appreciate it.
Um,
my name's Jordan Tibideau.
I'm here hosting God's side.

3
00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:22.300
There's Toklas brought to you by top Topia go slash talk topia.

4
00:00:22.301 --> 00:00:25.930
I have a lot of great talks on there,
Tim Ferriss,
Ryan holiday and whatnot.
Um,

5
00:00:25.931 --> 00:00:28.300
so if you don't wanna miss out a great event,
go ahead and subscribe.

6
00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:31.870
So God's side is someone who doesn't really need an introduction,

7
00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:33.370
but I'm going to do it anyways.

8
00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:38.400
So He's a professor of marketing and at Concordia University in a research chair

9
00:00:38.651 --> 00:00:43.240
in evolutionary behavioral sciences and Darwin,
Darwinian consumption.

10
00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:47.590
Um,
he also has a amazing youtube channel,
which is called the quit the Godfather.

11
00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:52.600
The sad,
sorry,
the sad people call his nickname is the gospel yet the sad truth.

12
00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:54.520
So anyways,
uh,

13
00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:58.740
thank you all for coming through and let's give a round of applause to Dr God's

14
00:00:58.741 --> 00:00:59.574
side.

15
00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.720
<v 0>[inaudible]</v>

16
00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:07.610
<v 2>thank you very much,
Jordan.
It's a true pleasure and honor for me to be here.
Uh,</v>

17
00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.370
I guess my life has gone full circle because my doctorate,
uh,

18
00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:17.000
which I defended 23 years ago was actually in a,

19
00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:18.380
an issue of search,

20
00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:22.010
which should be relevant to the top search company in the world.
Of course,

21
00:01:22.011 --> 00:01:23.580
you'd do more than that.
Uh,

22
00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.680
my doctoral dissertation was on a very specific problem,

23
00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:31.820
specifically something called stoppings behavior.

24
00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:36.530
When is it that we've acquired enough information to stop acquiring additional

25
00:01:36.531 --> 00:01:40.250
information and commit to a choice,
which is a fundamental search problem,
right?

26
00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.030
When you're choosing a mate to marry.
Of course,

27
00:01:44.031 --> 00:01:47.720
there are many more people to sample from in the world,

28
00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:51.460
yet we don't regrettably,
uh,

29
00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.930
when,

30
00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:57.620
when at the applies to which political candidate we choose which car we buy,

31
00:01:57.621 --> 00:01:58.910
which person to hire.

32
00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.410
We don't look at all of the available and relevant information.
Instead,

33
00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:07.160
we look at enough information until the point when we say,

34
00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:10.520
I'm ready to choose Toyota.
I'm ready to marry this person.

35
00:02:10.521 --> 00:02:13.210
I'm ready to hire this guy.
So this was the topic that,

36
00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:16.370
the cognitive processes of how we stop information search.

37
00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.870
That was my doctoral dissertation at Cornell.
Then I went off.

38
00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:25.370
Uh,
well actually,

39
00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:26.810
so let me tell you how it all started.

40
00:02:26.811 --> 00:02:31.410
The evolutionary part of my research career.
When I went to Cornell,

41
00:02:31.411 --> 00:02:35.270
it was really to study consumer choice as a mathematical modeler.

42
00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:39.890
And then I hooked up with a,
the guy who became my doctoral supervisor,

43
00:02:39.891 --> 00:02:41.840
who was a mathematical and cognitive psychologist,

44
00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:47.170
and he suggested that I go into the behavioral sciences first semester at

45
00:02:48.201 --> 00:02:52.550
Cornell.
I had taken a course with this.
Oh,
what did I do?

46
00:02:52.551 --> 00:02:56.780
What did I do?
Okay.
I had taken a course with this gentlemen,

47
00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:59.950
Professor Dennis Regan.
It was an advanced social course,

48
00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.890
and about halfway through the course he assigned,

49
00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:07.810
this is in fall 1990 my first semester at Cornell,
he assigned this book.

50
00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:10.000
Has Anybody heard of this book?
Has Anybody read it?

51
00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:12.193
<v 0>Sorry.</v>

52
00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:17.350
<v 2>Looks cheap.
Cheery,
cheery.
Yes,
exactly.
Uh,</v>

53
00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:22.220
homicide is a book written by two pioneers of evolutionary psychology,
uh,

54
00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:27.420
Martin Bailey and Margo Wilson where they offer evolutionary explanations for

55
00:03:29.021 --> 00:03:32.890
patterns of criminality to the extent that there are certain types of crimes

56
00:03:32.891 --> 00:03:37.891
that happen in roughly the same way across time across cultures.

57
00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:43.120
There might be some underlying universal processes that explain these crimes.

58
00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:48.450
And when I saw the explanatory power of evolutionary psychology and explaining

59
00:03:48.521 --> 00:03:51.370
criminality,
I had my Eureka moment.

60
00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:56.350
I knew that I would use that framework to study consumer behavior.

61
00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:58.480
Now either find consumer behavior very broadly.

62
00:03:58.481 --> 00:04:03.010
It's not just consuming coca cola and Starbucks,
but we consume religion,

63
00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:07.930
we consume friendships.
Uh,
you know,
pretty much anything you can think of,

64
00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:10.900
I could fit it under a conservatory umbrella.

65
00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:16.410
And so this is how I started looking at how I could apply biology and

66
00:04:17.021 --> 00:04:20.350
evolutionary psychology in particular.
The study are consuming nature.

67
00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:23.680
And so what I'll do for today's lecture is offer you,

68
00:04:23.681 --> 00:04:28.090
hopefully by the end of today's lecture you'll get a good sense of how we could

69
00:04:28.091 --> 00:04:31.840
use Darwinian thinking and studying consumption.

70
00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:38.720
Now,
as you might imagine in the social sciences,

71
00:04:38.721 --> 00:04:42.140
I really straddled both the natural sciences and the social sciences has given

72
00:04:42.141 --> 00:04:46.520
the work that I do amongst my natural science colleagues.
Of course,

73
00:04:46.521 --> 00:04:51.380
they all say yes,
of course biology matters.
Amongst my social science colleagues,

74
00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:56.680
the story's a bit more complicated because most social scientists in a sense,

75
00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:02.290
the fine their belongingness to the social sciences club by their abdication of

76
00:05:02.691 --> 00:05:04.880
biology,
right?
According to them,

77
00:05:04.881 --> 00:05:09.500
what makes us humans is that we transcend our biology and so as you might

78
00:05:09.501 --> 00:05:13.160
imagine,
I've had quite a bit of a rough ride.

79
00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:16.220
Now the reality is that science is an auto corrective process,

80
00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:18.230
so without being too gleeful,

81
00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:22.310
the better idea is eventually went out and I think most people now are starting

82
00:05:22.311 --> 00:05:22.911
to come around.

83
00:05:22.911 --> 00:05:27.911
It's becoming less tenable to say openly that you don't think biology,

84
00:05:28.161 --> 00:05:30.680
math is when it comes to human affairs,
but there are still some,

85
00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:35.270
you know all the remnants who refuse to admit that biology matters.

86
00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:36.410
Some of the key

87
00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:40.340
is that you're typically here some of the key objections.

88
00:05:40.341 --> 00:05:42.050
There are many more of these.
I discussed this by the way,

89
00:05:42.051 --> 00:05:46.820
the book that's a Jordan kindly got for you guys,
the consuming instinct.

90
00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:49.760
I discussed many of these,
the tractors,

91
00:05:49.761 --> 00:05:51.470
but let me just mention a few very briefly.

92
00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:53.960
So here's one typical argument you hear.

93
00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:56.990
Well biology is great.

94
00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:59.930
Explain the behavior of the mosquito and the Zebra and the dog,

95
00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:03.950
like surely you can't use biology to explain human behavior,
right?

96
00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:06.800
This is called the human reticence effect,
right?

97
00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:10.940
The exact same evolutionary principle might apply to every possible species

98
00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.200
except humans,
right?

99
00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:17.230
Evolution stops right here somehow are our brains come through a magical process

100
00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:22.610
that's outside of evolution,
which of course is ridiculous.

101
00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:25.130
Here's the second one.

102
00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:31.540
You often hear that evolutionary psychology is dangerous because if quilt

103
00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:36.500
justifies and condones reprehensible behavior,
so for example,

104
00:06:36.501 --> 00:06:41.501
if you explain wild child abuse might happen or why rape happens or why men and

105
00:06:42.141 --> 00:06:46.130
women cheat on one another in an otherwise monogamous union,

106
00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:50.750
then somebody will come along in a very irate manner and say you're using

107
00:06:50.751 --> 00:06:54.470
science to condone and justify these behaviors.
Of course,
you're not doing that,

108
00:06:54.471 --> 00:06:59.330
right?
The oncologist was studies pancreatic cancer is not for cancer,

109
00:06:59.331 --> 00:07:01.820
right?
He's not justifying cancer.

110
00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:05.660
He's studying honestly cancer.

111
00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:11.080
And so if you study child abuse and rape and marital and fidelity,

112
00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:13.700
that doesn't mean that you're for it,

113
00:07:13.701 --> 00:07:16.380
but it doesn't mean that you're trying to come up with an umbrella to justify.

114
00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:19.340
It means that you're trying to honestly understand these very reprehensible

115
00:07:19.341 --> 00:07:22.520
behaviors.
Here's another one that comes up often.

116
00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:28.100
This is what I call the,
uh,
but men are not taller than women because Tom,

117
00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:32.930
not Tom Jones,
uh,
what's his name?
What's the actor's name?
Tom Cruise.

118
00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:37.050
Tom Jones.
I'm showing my age.
Thumb Johns was a,
was a,

119
00:07:37.051 --> 00:07:39.680
a sex symbol in the 70s.
Uh,

120
00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:45.000
so Tom cruise or shorter than Katie Holmes,
it was his fault.
His ex wife.

121
00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:49.360
Therefore,
Aha.
It's not true that men are taller than women.
The,

122
00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:54.880
the cognitive bias there is that people take a single data thatum to falsify a

123
00:07:56.541 --> 00:08:01.100
statement that holds true at the population level.
So if you explain on average,

124
00:08:01.101 --> 00:08:05.630
men prefer to meet with Noubar fertile women,
more so than postmenopausal women,

125
00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:07.260
someone will put up their hand and say,

126
00:08:07.261 --> 00:08:11.240
but that's not true because my uncle Joe is dating an older woman named Linda.

127
00:08:11.470 --> 00:08:14.510
Oh Gee,
Darwin is dead.
We're back to the drawing boards,
right?

128
00:08:14.750 --> 00:08:16.820
Of course that's not true,
but again,

129
00:08:16.821 --> 00:08:18.980
that's the cognitive bias that people succumb to.

130
00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:24.000
And this one is the one that irritates me the most because it is the one that

131
00:08:24.291 --> 00:08:27.830
typically is levied by otherwise sophisticated academics.

132
00:08:28.250 --> 00:08:31.640
They say that evolutionary psychology is just a bunch of fancy,

133
00:08:31.641 --> 00:08:35.360
full post hoc stories that you come up with after the fact.

134
00:08:35.810 --> 00:08:39.280
Nothing could be further from the truth as I will show you,
uh,

135
00:08:39.410 --> 00:08:42.110
in a few slides coming up,

136
00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:49.130
this is going to be a bit of the technical part of the presentation and then

137
00:08:49.131 --> 00:08:52.760
later I'll give you some sort of sexy practical examples.

138
00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:57.360
So the epidemiology of evolutionary psychology or [inaudible] for short,

139
00:08:57.361 --> 00:08:59.070
I'll just call it GP.
So the,
the,

140
00:08:59.071 --> 00:09:02.880
the method of EDP is really comprised of three components.

141
00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:08.100
When you're doing evolutionary research,
you really are doing these three things.

142
00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:12.240
You first have to differentiae and I'll explain each each of these.
In turn,

143
00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:15.330
you have to differentiate between what are called proximate and ultimate

144
00:09:15.331 --> 00:09:19.740
scientific explanations.
That's a fundamentally important distinction.

145
00:09:20.250 --> 00:09:21.390
And I'll talk about this in a second.

146
00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:26.280
You build what are called neurological networks of cumulative evidence.
Very,

147
00:09:26.281 --> 00:09:27.150
very important.
Again,

148
00:09:27.151 --> 00:09:30.600
I'll expand this and then you'll also build what are called consilience trees of

149
00:09:30.601 --> 00:09:34.500
knowledge.
Consilience basically means unity of knowledge.

150
00:09:34.770 --> 00:09:37.680
Physics is more conciliatory than sociology,

151
00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:40.260
not because physicists are smarter than sociologists,

152
00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:45.390
but because physics has organized its knowledge base in a way where there are

153
00:09:45.391 --> 00:09:48.990
these organized coherent trees of knowledge.
Sociology hasn't,

154
00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:51.840
we can't agree in sociology whether there are,

155
00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:55.350
there is such a thing as innate sex differences or not.
Okay,

156
00:09:55.950 --> 00:09:58.950
so I'll explain each of these in turn.

157
00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:04.770
So let's begin with this first one.
So here I'm going to discuss this one.

158
00:10:07.050 --> 00:10:10.020
The difference between proximate and ultimate explanations.

159
00:10:11.430 --> 00:10:14.430
Much of science operates at the approximate level.

160
00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:19.320
Most Nobel prizes that have ever been won have been one at the approximate
level.

161
00:10:19.321 --> 00:10:20.370
What that's proximate means,

162
00:10:20.850 --> 00:10:25.470
proximate means you're trying to understand the how and what other phenomenon.

163
00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:27.570
How does diabetes work?

164
00:10:27.810 --> 00:10:31.470
What are some factors that increase the severity of the symptoms of diabetes?

165
00:10:31.650 --> 00:10:35.820
These questions,
the how and what,
which is where much of science operates.

166
00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:40.680
Those are proximate questions,
ultimate questions.
And by the way,
here,

167
00:10:40.681 --> 00:10:44.760
people think ultimate means superior.
It's the ultimate.
That's not what it means.

168
00:10:45.150 --> 00:10:48.990
Ultimate means the ultimate Darwinian.
Why?

169
00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:53.220
Why would the mechanism have evolved to be of that form?

170
00:10:53.970 --> 00:10:58.970
So it's not that ultimate explanations are superior to approximate ones is that

171
00:10:59.131 --> 00:11:03.450
you need both levels of explanations to fully understand a phenomenon.

172
00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:09.090
So again,
you will only studied these types of explanations.

173
00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:11.850
If you come with an evolutionary lens.
Now you might say,
okay,

174
00:11:11.851 --> 00:11:13.380
I'm not really quite following what this says.

175
00:11:13.710 --> 00:11:18.300
So let me give you a very concrete example.
Take for example,
pregnancy sickness.

176
00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:23.840
This is a universal phenomenon that happens throughout time and across cultures.

177
00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:26.400
Women at a very predictable point,

178
00:11:26.670 --> 00:11:29.310
and they're just station will experience pregnancy.

179
00:11:29.311 --> 00:11:32.100
So the reason why we call it pregnancy sickness rather than the morning sickness

180
00:11:32.430 --> 00:11:35.130
is because it doesn't only manifest itself in the morning,

181
00:11:35.370 --> 00:11:40.050
although typically it does.
So we call it more generally pregnancy sickness.
Well,

182
00:11:40.051 --> 00:11:43.140
what would be a proximate story to,

183
00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:46.170
to tackle when it comes to pregnancy sickness?
Well,

184
00:11:46.350 --> 00:11:51.350
how do the hormonal fluctuations of a woman affect the severity of her symptoms?

185
00:11:52.650 --> 00:11:54.130
That's approximate question.

186
00:11:55.360 --> 00:12:00.360
The ultimate question is why have women evolved this physiological response?

187
00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:06.960
Why is it that women at a very specific point and their gestation actually

188
00:12:07.841 --> 00:12:11.980
experience these very,
very ugly and unpleasant symptoms?

189
00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:16.720
And the answer from an adaptive evolutionary perspective is that this is the

190
00:12:16.721 --> 00:12:21.721
mechanism to protect the fetus in utero from exposure to pathogens at a very

191
00:12:25.241 --> 00:12:29.530
specific point in the gestation called organogenesis during the first trimester,

192
00:12:30.070 --> 00:12:33.220
if the fetus is exposed typically through food pathogens,

193
00:12:33.340 --> 00:12:38.340
things that the woman will and ingest consume that could wreck havoc with the

194
00:12:39.910 --> 00:12:42.130
development of the organs.
Therefore,

195
00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:47.560
evolution has yielded a very elegant adaptive solution.

196
00:12:47.770 --> 00:12:52.770
Women tend to be repelled from foods or other other sources that have high

197
00:12:54.701 --> 00:12:55.900
teratogen values.

198
00:12:56.260 --> 00:13:01.260
Will there'll be attracted to other foods that serve antimicrobial properties?

199
00:13:02.140 --> 00:13:02.920
Pickling right?

200
00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:07.000
The typical stereotype of a woman of a pregnant woman wanting pickles,
well,

201
00:13:07.001 --> 00:13:10.300
pickling has an antimicrobial property,
right?

202
00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:15.700
Women who experience more pregnancy sickness are less likely to have

203
00:13:15.701 --> 00:13:16.600
miscarriages.

204
00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:22.200
The outcome of the child is greater if the woman experienced his pregnancy

205
00:13:22.781 --> 00:13:23.350
sickness.

206
00:13:23.350 --> 00:13:28.350
So when a woman goes to her ob Gyn and he or she will give her a pill to

207
00:13:29.441 --> 00:13:32.320
attenuate those symptoms from an evolutionary perspective,

208
00:13:32.321 --> 00:13:34.030
you're doing the exactly incorrect thing.

209
00:13:34.210 --> 00:13:37.960
Now you might need it because you might have to give a talk that they at Google

210
00:13:37.961 --> 00:13:41.380
and you can't run every three seconds to throw up.
So from that perspective,

211
00:13:41.381 --> 00:13:43.570
from that proximate perspective,
it makes sense.

212
00:13:43.780 --> 00:13:45.650
But from an evolutionary perspective,
it doesn't.

213
00:13:45.670 --> 00:13:50.470
So here you see the difference between a proximate perspective and an ultimate

214
00:13:50.471 --> 00:13:55.090
one.
Sorry,

215
00:13:55.091 --> 00:13:58.940
the the,
the,
you might not be able to read this very clearly,
but let me this,

216
00:13:58.950 --> 00:14:02.710
this,
this now goes to the second point here.

217
00:14:02.711 --> 00:14:06.250
I'm going to talk about how you build these normal logical networks of chemo.

218
00:14:06.251 --> 00:14:10.420
The evidence,
how do you build evolutionary explanations?

219
00:14:10.780 --> 00:14:15.280
And it was exactly the opposite of this idea that we just sit there with smoking

220
00:14:15.281 --> 00:14:20.050
a pipe,
coming up with fanciful stories.
It's the exact opposite of that.

221
00:14:20.590 --> 00:14:21.423
So here we go.

222
00:14:26.340 --> 00:14:30.900
So here I'm looking at the biological roots of toy preferences.

223
00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:34.920
Are Toy preferences innate biological,

224
00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:37.260
or is it as social scientists?

225
00:14:37.261 --> 00:14:42.261
Tell us the means by which little boys and little girls learn about their

226
00:14:42.630 --> 00:14:46.350
sexist,
arbitrary,
arbitrary stereotypes.
Right?

227
00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:48.180
From the social scientist perspective,

228
00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:50.550
biology has nothing to do with toy preferences.

229
00:14:51.170 --> 00:14:54.530
The evidence points very much against that position.

230
00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:59.240
So what I've done here is I've built a normal logical network.

231
00:14:59.241 --> 00:15:03.650
What's the normal logical network?
It's evidence stemming from many,

232
00:15:03.651 --> 00:15:05.930
many different lines of,
of,

233
00:15:06.110 --> 00:15:11.110
of well evidence that makes it unassailable that there is an inherent biological

234
00:15:13.041 --> 00:15:15.320
route to toy preferences.
Yeah.

235
00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:19.940
So I took a lot of effort to actually build this neurological networks.
So let's,

236
00:15:19.941 --> 00:15:22.880
let's go through it very quickly.
So you could take,

237
00:15:22.881 --> 00:15:24.590
this is from developmental psychology.

238
00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:29.690
You could take children who are too young to be socialized.
In other words,

239
00:15:29.691 --> 00:15:30.560
by definition,

240
00:15:30.890 --> 00:15:35.000
they haven't yet reached the cognitive stage where they could be taught by mommy

241
00:15:35.001 --> 00:15:37.850
and daddy to play with trucks and dolls.
And guess what?

242
00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:43.310
They already exhibit those sex specific preferences.
Now you might say,

243
00:15:43.311 --> 00:15:45.620
how did,
how do you,
how do you elicit those preferences?

244
00:15:45.950 --> 00:15:49.730
It's either usually when they reach to one of the toys or the other or through

245
00:15:49.731 --> 00:15:50.600
gay studies.

246
00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:55.340
So little boys do look at trucks much more than little girls and little girls

247
00:15:55.341 --> 00:15:57.560
will look at dogs and so on.

248
00:15:57.680 --> 00:16:02.680
So already just that one line of evidence is casting doubt on the idea that

249
00:16:03.861 --> 00:16:08.450
there is no innate preference involved with toys.
But let's go on.

250
00:16:09.350 --> 00:16:10.160
Look at this one.

251
00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:15.160
Cross species studies done with vervet monkeys would rhesus monkeys and with

252
00:16:16.041 --> 00:16:19.970
chimps shows the same sex specificity of toy preferences.

253
00:16:20.090 --> 00:16:24.560
That's not looking like it's all due to arbitrary sexist stereotypes from the

254
00:16:24.561 --> 00:16:26.570
patriarchy that's go on.

255
00:16:28.010 --> 00:16:29.660
Clinical endocrinology,

256
00:16:29.690 --> 00:16:32.780
girls who are afflicted with congenital adrenal hyperplasia,

257
00:16:33.050 --> 00:16:38.000
this is an endocrinological disorder that masculinizing morphological features

258
00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:40.160
that masculinized his behaviors.

259
00:16:40.340 --> 00:16:44.930
So little girls who suffer from congenital adrenal hyperplasia,

260
00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:46.670
what do you think happens to their top preferences?

261
00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:48.800
They become a lot more similar to boys.

262
00:16:49.220 --> 00:16:53.030
It's not looking like it's all due to random socialization.
Does it?

263
00:16:53.390 --> 00:16:54.800
Let's keep going.
If you're not convinced.

264
00:16:56.660 --> 00:17:01.490
Cross cultural study.
Sweden,
by the way,
are there any Swedes here?

265
00:17:02.180 --> 00:17:06.920
No.
Okay,
so then I'll bash on Sweden without
uh,

266
00:17:07.490 --> 00:17:09.500
Sweden.
There's,
there's something called the hops.

267
00:17:09.501 --> 00:17:14.150
That score half said was a cross cultural psychologist who scored countries

268
00:17:14.180 --> 00:17:18.400
along different cultural values,
suite of all countries in the world.

269
00:17:18.610 --> 00:17:21.020
Sweden's scores the highest on femininity.

270
00:17:21.290 --> 00:17:26.290
So if there is a natural experiment where you could see whether toy preferences

271
00:17:27.710 --> 00:17:32.710
in a feminized society would somehow flip Sweden would be the case.

272
00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:35.330
So this person,
inventor,

273
00:17:35.390 --> 00:17:40.390
inventor read 40,000 toys in actual bedrooms of little boys and little girls in

274
00:17:42.861 --> 00:17:44.600
Sweden.
And guess what?

275
00:17:45.020 --> 00:17:50.020
They had the exact same toy preferences as everywhere else in the world already.

276
00:17:51.060 --> 00:17:54.300
We've reached enough evidence but let's keep hammering it.

277
00:17:54.301 --> 00:17:55.620
So becomes unassailable.

278
00:17:56.310 --> 00:18:00.900
You could do cross cultural studies would non western samples because you might

279
00:18:00.901 --> 00:18:03.360
say,
oh about Sweden is still a westernized country.

280
00:18:03.630 --> 00:18:08.630
So you could go to two cultures in Sahara and the North African region that have

281
00:18:09.331 --> 00:18:14.331
absolutely no venn diagram interactions on many of these cultural values.

282
00:18:15.180 --> 00:18:19.020
And yet the sec specificity of toys is exactly the same.

283
00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:23.370
Let's keep going.
You could look at classics,

284
00:18:23.610 --> 00:18:27.080
meaning ancient Greece and you look at at,
you could look at funerals,

285
00:18:27.150 --> 00:18:31.530
funerary art and tombstones.
What is the art that's depicted?

286
00:18:31.770 --> 00:18:36.150
Little boys are depicted with the typical sex specific toys and little girls

287
00:18:36.151 --> 00:18:37.740
with a typical sex specific toys.

288
00:18:38.220 --> 00:18:40.860
It's not looking like it's due to the patriarchy,
is it

289
00:18:42.990 --> 00:18:44.910
pediatric endocrinology?

290
00:18:45.210 --> 00:18:49.620
You could take urine samples from little boys and little girls starting at age

291
00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:52.320
seven days until six months,

292
00:18:52.590 --> 00:18:55.170
and you show that the more testosterone you have,

293
00:18:55.860 --> 00:18:59.010
that will affect your toy preferences.
I won't go through all of it.
I mean,

294
00:18:59.011 --> 00:19:00.000
I guess I missed one or two,

295
00:19:00.150 --> 00:19:03.570
but you get the general idea by building these normal logical networks of

296
00:19:03.571 --> 00:19:07.140
cumulative evidence stemming from completely different fields,

297
00:19:07.830 --> 00:19:12.580
you then build an evolutionary argument.
This doesn't look like it's just random.

298
00:19:13.130 --> 00:19:17.760
Just so storytelling does it.
Let's keep going.
Here's another example.

299
00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:21.540
This one is a bit more controversial because we're talking about mating

300
00:19:21.541 --> 00:19:22.374
preferences.

301
00:19:23.430 --> 00:19:27.810
Men haven't evolved preference for the hourglass figure in women.
My goodness,

302
00:19:27.811 --> 00:19:31.920
that's very,
that's very sexist to say.
No,
it's not.
Women,
by the way,

303
00:19:31.921 --> 00:19:36.510
have very clear morphological preferences and the types of men they prefer.

304
00:19:37.050 --> 00:19:39.210
For a sexually reproducing species.

305
00:19:39.420 --> 00:19:44.420
You would expect that the two sexes would have evolved preferences.

306
00:19:44.970 --> 00:19:46.710
It's called sexual selection.

307
00:19:46.950 --> 00:19:49.950
The fundamental one of the fundamental mechanisms of evolution.

308
00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:55.940
So let's see whether we can build an adaptive evolutionary argument to explain

309
00:19:56.910 --> 00:20:00.840
this reality.
All right,
well,

310
00:20:00.900 --> 00:20:04.380
it turns out that the hourglass figure medically has been shown to be a reliable

311
00:20:04.381 --> 00:20:05.700
queue of fertility and health.

312
00:20:05.701 --> 00:20:08.790
So we're not just building these evolutionary arguments,
uh,
you know,

313
00:20:08.791 --> 00:20:10.740
while taking acid,
right?

314
00:20:11.550 --> 00:20:16.200
There's actually epidemiological studies that demonstrate that if you have an

315
00:20:16.201 --> 00:20:20.400
hourglass figure,
you're more likely to be fertile,

316
00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:21.780
you're more likely to be healthy.

317
00:20:22.110 --> 00:20:25.230
And so it doesn't take much of an evolutionist understand why they'd be

318
00:20:25.231 --> 00:20:29.910
selection pressures for men to prefer women who have the body shape of Beyonce

319
00:20:29.940 --> 00:20:33.870
more so than a male Olympic swimmer.
Okay,

320
00:20:34.260 --> 00:20:38.340
let's keep going.
This actually one of the sites that studies comes from me,

321
00:20:38.341 --> 00:20:41.910
let me tell you the background to it.
A few years ago,

322
00:20:41.911 --> 00:20:45.270
one of my undergraduate students had finished his course with me and then came

323
00:20:45.271 --> 00:20:47.110
to me at the end of the course and said,
hey,

324
00:20:47.111 --> 00:20:48.940
I'd like to hang out with you professor side,

325
00:20:48.941 --> 00:20:53.560
and maybe serve as a research assistant on some project.
I said to at the time,

326
00:20:53.561 --> 00:20:56.200
I didn't have any research funds.
I didn't have my chaired professorship yet.

327
00:20:56.620 --> 00:20:59.410
I said,
well,
I don't have any immediate money to give you.
So he goes,
well,

328
00:20:59.411 --> 00:21:01.600
it doesn't matter.
I'll do it pro bono work.
Just give me a project.

329
00:21:01.601 --> 00:21:03.220
I just want to hang out and learn from you.

330
00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:07.540
So I thought about what project to give him and I contacted and I said,

331
00:21:07.890 --> 00:21:09.070
all right,
I think I've got a project for you.

332
00:21:09.250 --> 00:21:12.340
How would you like to surf porn sites for a couple of weeks?

333
00:21:12.790 --> 00:21:15.370
To which he answered,
I love you.
Professor said,

334
00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:20.530
what did I ask him to do?
I wanted to see.

335
00:21:22.030 --> 00:21:23.380
Speaking of search engines,

336
00:21:23.770 --> 00:21:28.690
the Internet allows us to really get access to cross cultural data very quickly.

337
00:21:29.260 --> 00:21:29.740
I said,

338
00:21:29.740 --> 00:21:34.740
go to as many sites as you can find online where they advertise online escorts,

339
00:21:36.731 --> 00:21:40.540
feet,
women advertising.
There's sexual services.
My name is Linda.

340
00:21:40.541 --> 00:21:42.400
Here's my height,
here's my age.

341
00:21:42.790 --> 00:21:44.800
And usually they always give you their measurements.

342
00:21:45.190 --> 00:21:48.400
Now of course it doesn't matter whether their measurements are true or not,

343
00:21:48.401 --> 00:21:51.880
right?
Because sometimes people say,
oh,
but what if she's lying?
Who Cares?

344
00:21:51.881 --> 00:21:55.060
That's not the point.
The point is what is she advertising?

345
00:21:55.061 --> 00:21:59.320
Because what she's advertising is what's catering to men's evolve preferences.

346
00:21:59.560 --> 00:22:03.790
And so I simply asked him to code the waist and the hip,

347
00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:05.680
and by the way,

348
00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:09.550
it gets you want to know later if you want to take the measurements,
uh,
women,

349
00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:14.650
the preferred a waist to hip on a woman is 0.7 on a man.
In other words,

350
00:22:14.651 --> 00:22:17.440
what women like in a man,
it's a 0.9.
Okay,

351
00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:22.920
so 0.7 is that marker while the average across 48 countries that couldn't be any

352
00:22:24.551 --> 00:22:28.480
more different than one another was point 72 exactly within what you would

353
00:22:28.481 --> 00:22:30.040
expect.
Okay,
let's keep going.

354
00:22:31.570 --> 00:22:36.570
Here is the hourglass across 286 Egyptian,

355
00:22:37.750 --> 00:22:42.750
African Greek or Roman and Indian sculptures spanning several thousand years and

356
00:22:43.691 --> 00:22:46.990
also looking at Joe Mont figurines,

357
00:22:47.320 --> 00:22:51.190
155 prehistoric figurines.
Guess what?

358
00:22:51.490 --> 00:22:53.980
The hourglass figure comes out across all those cultures.

359
00:22:54.250 --> 00:22:58.960
It doesn't seem like it's due to the pervasive patriarchy as shown in

360
00:22:58.961 --> 00:23:01.960
Cosmopolitan magazine.
Let's keep going.

361
00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:04.060
I won't go through all of these because you'll get the point.

362
00:23:04.061 --> 00:23:05.230
This one is the real killer.

363
00:23:05.231 --> 00:23:09.100
You ready for this congenitally blind men,

364
00:23:09.850 --> 00:23:14.850
men who've never had the gift of sight exhibit the hour glass figure preference.

365
00:23:16.630 --> 00:23:19.300
Now you might say,
well,
how do they elicit those preferences?

366
00:23:19.540 --> 00:23:22.870
They do it haptically.
They give different mannequins,

367
00:23:23.260 --> 00:23:25.960
the congenitally blind men,
you know,

368
00:23:26.500 --> 00:23:29.320
check them out and then they choose the one that's the hourglass.

369
00:23:29.980 --> 00:23:32.920
That doesn't suggest that it's due to media images.

370
00:23:33.010 --> 00:23:36.220
Those guys have never seen media images.
So again,

371
00:23:36.250 --> 00:23:37.240
I won't go through all of these,

372
00:23:37.241 --> 00:23:41.800
but systematically by coming up with data sources from completely different

373
00:23:41.801 --> 00:23:46.370
fields,
you end up building an unassailable,
by the way,

374
00:23:46.430 --> 00:23:50.990
none other than the Great Charles Darwin himself had precisely than that.

375
00:23:51.260 --> 00:23:54.230
Now he didn't call it normal logical networks of cumulative evidence.

376
00:23:54.770 --> 00:23:57.140
This is a term that came in later.
For those of you are interested,

377
00:23:57.141 --> 00:24:01.310
you can check out a paper by Schmidt and pilcher that have that have done this,

378
00:24:01.910 --> 00:24:05.240
but when he,
when he did origin of speech,
when he wrote origin of species,
the,

379
00:24:05.300 --> 00:24:08.990
the book that introduces the idea of natural selection,

380
00:24:09.530 --> 00:24:10.820
that's exactly what he did.

381
00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:16.460
He came up with years of observations coming from many,

382
00:24:16.490 --> 00:24:20.450
many different fields.
Which one put together,

383
00:24:20.660 --> 00:24:24.800
makes his natural selection idea seem on a salable.

384
00:24:25.550 --> 00:24:29.120
So contrary to what most people who don't understand evolutionary psychology

385
00:24:29.180 --> 00:24:31.790
argue,
which is all we just come up with fanciful stories.

386
00:24:32.030 --> 00:24:33.350
It's the exact opposite.

387
00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:37.970
The evidentiary threshold that we set before we decide that something is an

388
00:24:37.971 --> 00:24:42.020
adaptation is actually much higher than the rest of the sciences.

389
00:24:42.980 --> 00:24:43.910
All right,
let's keep going.

390
00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:50.550
So this is exactly what this curve is showing.
Here's,

391
00:24:51.420 --> 00:24:56.420
here's the threshold that you'd like to reach and support of your hypothesis.

392
00:24:56.880 --> 00:25:01.880
Here's the threshold that you'd like to reach to refute your hypothesis.

393
00:25:02.940 --> 00:25:07.500
And basically each of those squares that I showed you earlier is systematically

394
00:25:07.530 --> 00:25:09.780
leading us up to that threshold.

395
00:25:10.540 --> 00:25:13.620
<v 0>Okay?
All right,</v>

396
00:25:15.110 --> 00:25:17.990
<v 2>so now that that was sort of the more technical part of the chat,</v>

397
00:25:18.020 --> 00:25:21.350
now that's kind of give,
uh,
give you some breathing room.

398
00:25:21.980 --> 00:25:26.930
Our consumers born or made you often will hear this,
is it nature or nurture?

399
00:25:27.140 --> 00:25:29.120
That's actually a false dichotomy.

400
00:25:29.450 --> 00:25:33.770
And the example I like to use as the cake metaphor,
if you look here,

401
00:25:34.040 --> 00:25:39.040
each of these are ingredients that constitute elements of baking a cake.

402
00:25:40.460 --> 00:25:45.020
Then I bake the cake.
If I now tell you here,
please point to the sugar,

403
00:25:45.050 --> 00:25:48.920
please point to the eggs.
You can't.
It's an inextricable mix of all of it.

404
00:25:49.160 --> 00:25:52.760
That's what humans are for most relevant phenomena.

405
00:25:52.970 --> 00:25:56.180
We are an inextricable makes of our nature and our nurture.

406
00:25:56.450 --> 00:25:58.130
That's called the interaction as viewpoint.

407
00:25:58.340 --> 00:26:00.500
Our genes interact with the environment.

408
00:26:00.680 --> 00:26:03.890
So it's not only the environment as many social scientists,

409
00:26:03.891 --> 00:26:08.810
things and no serious evolutionist thinks that the environment doesn't matter.

410
00:26:09.500 --> 00:26:14.000
But what we do say as you have to take biology into account.

411
00:26:14.870 --> 00:26:15.890
Now of course in my work,

412
00:26:15.891 --> 00:26:19.490
what I do is I introduced biology to the business school,
right?

413
00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:21.530
If anybody here has an MBA,

414
00:26:21.531 --> 00:26:26.110
you undoubtedly have tangible Mba without ever hearing the word biology

415
00:26:26.140 --> 00:26:28.700
mentioned.
That's crazy because the,

416
00:26:29.060 --> 00:26:33.680
our hormones affect the investment decisions that we make if we're situationally

417
00:26:33.681 --> 00:26:37.880
hungry or not,
we decide to make the decision a or B,
right?

418
00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:42.560
So all sorts of very basic physiological realities affect the decisions that we

419
00:26:42.561 --> 00:26:45.480
make,
whether we're employers,
employees,
consumers,
managers.

420
00:26:45.810 --> 00:26:49.710
And so what I try to do is systematically introduce evolutionary theory into the

421
00:26:49.711 --> 00:26:54.600
business school.
Uh,
I'll,
I'll skip this part because it might take a bit to,

422
00:26:54.601 --> 00:26:55.434
to,
to cover.

423
00:27:00.790 --> 00:27:04.900
Evolutionary psychology is not only about looking at human universals things

424
00:27:04.901 --> 00:27:07.390
that are the same across cultures evolutions I called.

425
00:27:07.391 --> 00:27:11.350
You can also be used to explain why cultural differences exist.

426
00:27:12.060 --> 00:27:16.630
So for example,
some cultures have very spicy foods,

427
00:27:17.230 --> 00:27:21.610
other cultures have very non spicy foods.
If I were a cultural psychologist,

428
00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:24.550
I would simply stop at that fact.

429
00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:27.610
I would simply point the Malaysians have spicy food.

430
00:27:27.940 --> 00:27:32.110
The Swedish folks don't have spicy foods.
Good night everyone.
And ends there.

431
00:27:32.980 --> 00:27:35.260
An evolutionist says no.

432
00:27:35.620 --> 00:27:40.620
Why do culinary traditions evolve to take different trajectories?

433
00:27:41.530 --> 00:27:46.530
Is there a fundamental reason that could help us understand why some culinary

434
00:27:47.681 --> 00:27:50.680
traditions are spicier than others?
In this case,
here's it.

435
00:27:50.740 --> 00:27:55.740
Very spicy Mexican soup and here's the very non spicy classic Swedish meatball

436
00:27:56.891 --> 00:27:59.470
plates.
And there turns out to be a very good answer.

437
00:28:00.250 --> 00:28:05.250
If you map the spiciness of a cuisine against pathogenic density across

438
00:28:07.961 --> 00:28:12.730
different environments,
it's the data couldn't be more perfect.
Why?

439
00:28:13.030 --> 00:28:17.440
Because in hot climates where there is a greater proliferation of food

440
00:28:17.441 --> 00:28:18.274
pathogens,

441
00:28:18.970 --> 00:28:23.970
cultures evolve to come up with a solution to a biological problem.

442
00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:28.360
Therefore spices pay,
curling,
smoking.

443
00:28:28.510 --> 00:28:33.510
Salting are all cultural adaptations to a basic biological problem.

444
00:28:34.060 --> 00:28:37.720
So culture doesn't exist outside the boundaries of biology.

445
00:28:37.930 --> 00:28:42.310
Cultures exist because of biology.
Nothing is outside of biology.

446
00:28:42.980 --> 00:28:43.813
<v 0>Okay,</v>

447
00:28:46.330 --> 00:28:51.330
<v 2>here's a cool example to explain something known as the Var variety effects or</v>

448
00:28:51.501 --> 00:28:54.430
the variety effect is the idea that when you go to a buffet,

449
00:28:55.450 --> 00:28:59.210
most of us will tend to overeat.
Some of us more than others,
uh,

450
00:28:59.350 --> 00:29:04.330
because it triggers our pension for variety seeking.
When it comes to foods.

451
00:29:04.630 --> 00:29:08.470
Now for some animals,
they have a very high metabolic rate,
right?

452
00:29:08.471 --> 00:29:09.670
So if you are a hummingbird,

453
00:29:10.120 --> 00:29:15.120
you have to eat roughly three times your body weight in a typical day just to

454
00:29:16.421 --> 00:29:20.860
survive till tomorrow.
If you did that as a 200 pound individual,

455
00:29:21.010 --> 00:29:24.400
you'd have to eat 600 pounds.
Well,
of course we don't have that metabolic rate,

456
00:29:24.700 --> 00:29:29.470
but yet we still have this penchant to eat many different foods.

457
00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:32.680
Which results,
for example,
if you go to an all inclusive vacation,

458
00:29:32.830 --> 00:29:36.820
has anybody been been to club med?
Anybody?
On average,

459
00:29:36.821 --> 00:29:40.810
it's I think five pounds a week.
So if you go for two weeks,

460
00:29:42.370 --> 00:29:46.330
you coming,
I don't care how much exercise you do while you're there,

461
00:29:46.360 --> 00:29:50.920
you're putting on roughly about 10 pounds because at an all inclusive resort,

462
00:29:51.410 --> 00:29:52.000
uh,

463
00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:56.470
it's almost impossible for you to not succumb to the pool of sampling way more

464
00:29:56.471 --> 00:30:00.970
foods than you otherwise would.
And so it was very too cool examples.

465
00:30:01.240 --> 00:30:04.360
Here's a,
I mean it's,
these are such simple studies,

466
00:30:04.361 --> 00:30:06.340
but yet they explained something so profound.

467
00:30:06.700 --> 00:30:09.580
Take m and m's that are one color or a multicolored.

468
00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:12.550
The colorant is tasteless,
odorless,

469
00:30:12.551 --> 00:30:17.080
and otherwise it doesn't affect in any way objectively what happens.

470
00:30:17.320 --> 00:30:21.040
But which of these two do you think people eat more of this one.

471
00:30:22.050 --> 00:30:22.570
Okay.

472
00:30:22.570 --> 00:30:27.570
Because it's the visual system is being tricked into sampling more because of

473
00:30:28.151 --> 00:30:31.240
the variety of colors.
Exact same study,

474
00:30:31.270 --> 00:30:35.950
but using shapes in this case here is one shaped,
uh,
pasta.

475
00:30:36.100 --> 00:30:39.130
Multi shaped does otherwise the past does exactly the same.

476
00:30:39.490 --> 00:30:41.920
I eat a lot more of this one.
Okay.

477
00:30:45.280 --> 00:30:49.510
Now this is actually a study.
This is one of the studies that perhaps,
uh,

478
00:30:49.960 --> 00:30:52.150
I mean I'm fortunate enough that my work,

479
00:30:52.151 --> 00:30:55.000
not only I received this tension amongst scientists,

480
00:30:55.001 --> 00:30:58.000
but because of the type of work I do,
often the media comes calling.

481
00:30:58.300 --> 00:31:01.960
This is one of those studies where the media came calling a lot and you'll see

482
00:31:01.961 --> 00:31:06.310
in a second why.
So I took here at principal from animal behavior,

483
00:31:06.580 --> 00:31:08.740
literally called peacocking,
right?

484
00:31:08.741 --> 00:31:12.100
Where in this case you've got the male peacock.
Here's the hen.

485
00:31:13.180 --> 00:31:17.900
And he's basically,
he starts exhibiting this type of signaling,
uh,
to,

486
00:31:18.010 --> 00:31:22.060
to show the iridescence coloring the size of the patterns,

487
00:31:22.150 --> 00:31:27.010
the size of the tail.
All of this is what's known in biology as a,

488
00:31:27.220 --> 00:31:29.590
as a handicap principle.
Why?

489
00:31:30.010 --> 00:31:34.960
Because for this animal to have evolved such a burdensome Pale,
right?

490
00:31:35.110 --> 00:31:40.110
This tail actually goes against its survival and actually reduces the likelihood

491
00:31:41.141 --> 00:31:43.840
of him taking flight and avoiding predators.

492
00:31:44.050 --> 00:31:47.860
It actually increases the likelihood of a Predator seeing him.

493
00:31:48.220 --> 00:31:52.240
So how could it evolve through natural selection?
It's certainly couldn't evolve.

494
00:31:52.390 --> 00:31:57.390
It evolves through sexual selection because it is actually an honest signal of

495
00:31:59.680 --> 00:32:02.200
his phenotypic quality.
He is saying,
look,

496
00:32:02.950 --> 00:32:07.330
this spite the costs I am carrying for having this stale,

497
00:32:07.450 --> 00:32:09.850
here I am,
I'm the real deal.
Pick me.

498
00:32:10.330 --> 00:32:15.330
So I take this idea and then I apply it to human consumer behavior.

499
00:32:16.450 --> 00:32:21.450
And therefore for all of you rich Google types that are buying the Maserati,

500
00:32:23.140 --> 00:32:27.040
you're just lowly peacocks.
I got your,

501
00:32:27.250 --> 00:32:31.090
I got you pegged from day one,
right?
What are you doing?
You're basically saying,

502
00:32:31.420 --> 00:32:33.730
look,
your little pretend that are males.

503
00:32:34.690 --> 00:32:39.690
You can't compete with me because it requires for you to play at a higher level

504
00:32:40.130 --> 00:32:43.700
to reach my signal.
By the way,
the upper uppers,

505
00:32:44.390 --> 00:32:49.390
the highest echelon actually drive very non fancy cars.

506
00:32:49.520 --> 00:32:54.440
Why anybody?
Any ideas?
Yes.

507
00:32:57.190 --> 00:32:58.023
<v 0>Okay,</v>

508
00:32:58.360 --> 00:33:00.190
<v 2>good.
Good answer.
No,
it's yes.</v>

509
00:33:01.680 --> 00:33:02.513
<v 0>Okay.</v>

510
00:33:02.950 --> 00:33:03.910
<v 2>It's almost that.</v>

511
00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:06.273
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

512
00:33:06.460 --> 00:33:11.400
<v 2>exactly.
Well,
especially within their social class,
right?
So let me,
let me say it.</v>

513
00:33:11.401 --> 00:33:16.401
So if I am a billionaire driving a Ferrari amongst my billionaire circle is not

514
00:33:20.921 --> 00:33:24.820
really a barrier to entry for their signaling as they could match that as well.

515
00:33:25.060 --> 00:33:25.541
Therefore,

516
00:33:25.541 --> 00:33:30.541
it is an irrelevant cue to use to demonstrate my honest status.

517
00:33:31.330 --> 00:33:32.710
The way that I would do that,

518
00:33:32.830 --> 00:33:37.830
as I will buy a painting that a three year old could have painted and pay $100

519
00:33:39.490 --> 00:33:43.720
million for it.
Now that's an honest signal.
It has to be wasteful.

520
00:33:43.900 --> 00:33:46.510
Just like the Peacock's tail has to be wasteful.

521
00:33:46.810 --> 00:33:49.840
Throwing away a $100 million on something that a three year old,

522
00:33:49.841 --> 00:33:54.730
the gender it could do now.
That's impressive.
I'm mixing it up for you.

523
00:33:54.731 --> 00:33:57.510
You guys are too politically correct.
Let's bump it up again.

524
00:33:59.410 --> 00:34:03.130
Okay.
All right.
So therefore what I did in this study,

525
00:34:05.710 --> 00:34:09.370
not a three year old agenda,
a prospective three-year-old,
the generative,

526
00:34:09.560 --> 00:34:12.550
because at three years old,
he is trajectory hasn't been set yet.

527
00:34:13.660 --> 00:34:18.580
So what we did here is we took this idea and we actually,
and I say we,

528
00:34:18.581 --> 00:34:20.980
this is what my former graduate student,
John Fungus,

529
00:34:22.300 --> 00:34:27.300
we actually got a a Porsche and a beaten up car at this wasn't imagine you're

530
00:34:29.531 --> 00:34:32.800
driving a Porsche.
We actually rented a portion.
I always tell people,

531
00:34:32.980 --> 00:34:37.980
try to get a granting agency to give you money because you right,

532
00:34:38.560 --> 00:34:42.610
oh,
we're going to rent a Porsche for the weekend for scientific purposes.

533
00:34:43.300 --> 00:34:48.300
While we did and what we did for this study is after they drove these two cars,

534
00:34:49.270 --> 00:34:54.270
we took salivary assays to measure what do you think testosterone and what do

535
00:34:57.341 --> 00:34:58.121
you think happens?

536
00:34:58.121 --> 00:35:03.121
You put a young male in this car and has endocrinological system explodes right

537
00:35:04.330 --> 00:35:08.230
now.
In retrospect,
you all say,
yeah,
of course that makes sense,
but guess what?

538
00:35:08.560 --> 00:35:10.840
Nobody in the business school is looking at things like that.

539
00:35:11.380 --> 00:35:16.380
Somehow hormones magically ceased to be relevant when you enter the business

540
00:35:17.081 --> 00:35:21.310
world.
It doesn't.
It's an indelible part of who we are.
Let's go on.

541
00:35:21.880 --> 00:35:25.090
This is not my study.
This is from some British psychologist,

542
00:35:25.840 --> 00:35:30.490
but along the same lines in terms of the status of a car,

543
00:35:30.670 --> 00:35:35.140
you think the exact same car,
a guy you put him in a Ford Fiesta or in a Bentley,

544
00:35:35.440 --> 00:35:39.000
you think the same girl,
you do the same and you do opposite sex rating.
So for,

545
00:35:39.150 --> 00:35:43.560
for this guy you ask women to rate just how attractive he is.

546
00:35:43.561 --> 00:35:46.530
It's not how attractive as a mate,
which is a multi attribute,

547
00:35:46.710 --> 00:35:47.600
just how physically,
well,

548
00:35:47.601 --> 00:35:51.990
obviously his physical looks don't magically change if he's in a Bentley or not.

549
00:35:52.410 --> 00:35:56.670
Apparently they do.
If you're a woman,
this guy is gorgeous.

550
00:35:57.480 --> 00:35:58.590
This guy's of the generative.

551
00:36:00.790 --> 00:36:05.130
But for men is that didn't matter.
In other words,

552
00:36:05.340 --> 00:36:10.340
men that not evaluate the physical attractiveness of a woman as a function of

553
00:36:10.651 --> 00:36:12.990
which status symbol she was associated with.

554
00:36:13.320 --> 00:36:18.320
Now I could guarantee you that I could run the study and 50 countries of your

555
00:36:18.571 --> 00:36:21.510
choosing and we will exactly replicate this finding.

556
00:36:21.990 --> 00:36:26.100
We will replicate exactly this finding because the underlying phenomenon behind

557
00:36:26.101 --> 00:36:28.860
this finding is rooted in evolutionary psychology.

558
00:36:29.100 --> 00:36:34.050
It's not as though in Bolivia and in Nigeria and in Japan,

559
00:36:34.230 --> 00:36:35.610
this finding would be different.

560
00:36:36.320 --> 00:36:37.153
<v 0>All right.</v>

561
00:36:39.740 --> 00:36:43.550
<v 2>Same.
Same,
same thing done with uh,</v>

562
00:36:43.880 --> 00:36:48.880
a guy being shown next to a shady apartment or a fancy apartment and a woman.

563
00:36:49.610 --> 00:36:53.690
Same thing.
This guy is gorgeous.
This guy is not,
men.

564
00:36:53.691 --> 00:36:56.480
Couldn't give a damn where the girl was shown.

565
00:36:57.710 --> 00:37:00.560
So you could do this with a million different products and you'll get the exact

566
00:37:00.561 --> 00:37:01.394
same phenomenon.

567
00:37:03.670 --> 00:37:04.260
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

568
00:37:04.260 --> 00:37:05.910
<v 2>This is a study that we're currently,</v>

569
00:37:05.940 --> 00:37:09.030
this is a myself with one of my former doctoral students,
strip out gale.

570
00:37:09.420 --> 00:37:11.000
We've collected more data sense.

571
00:37:11.001 --> 00:37:15.090
So this could be probably updated to 2015 maybe a,

572
00:37:15.091 --> 00:37:16.050
here's what we do here.

573
00:37:17.610 --> 00:37:21.840
We created ostensibly an online dating profile.

574
00:37:22.050 --> 00:37:26.970
Here's the guy,
here's stuff about me.
Here's my favorite possession.

575
00:37:27.240 --> 00:37:30.960
The only thing we changed is his favorite possession.
He either has a red Kia,

576
00:37:31.290 --> 00:37:35.460
no disrespect to any Kia Kia owners or he's got the sport.

577
00:37:35.970 --> 00:37:39.990
And then we asked people to rate to rate this guy.

578
00:37:40.440 --> 00:37:43.860
Now let me give you the background to how I got the idea to,
to run this study.

579
00:37:44.220 --> 00:37:47.190
There was a famous study than a psychology,
uh,

580
00:37:47.191 --> 00:37:52.191
where they brought a guy into a room and introduced him by ascribing different

581
00:37:53.851 --> 00:37:58.320
academic statuses to him.
Uh,
here is,
uh,
Joe Smith.

582
00:37:58.321 --> 00:38:03.180
He's a lecturer.
Here's Joe Smith.
He's a associate purveyors,
Joe Smith,

583
00:38:03.181 --> 00:38:05.340
right?
And then when he left,

584
00:38:05.940 --> 00:38:10.860
they would ask the people to tell their perception of his height.

585
00:38:11.520 --> 00:38:15.600
Well,
it turns out that with academic status,
you grow taller.

586
00:38:15.690 --> 00:38:18.420
That's why I told my wife,
don't worry,
you're not married to a short guy.

587
00:38:18.421 --> 00:38:19.980
You married to an NBA star

588
00:38:22.170 --> 00:38:27.170
because the reality is that your perceptual system gets tricked by this status

589
00:38:31.260 --> 00:38:33.090
queue.
And so what happened here,

590
00:38:34.020 --> 00:38:39.020
this guy was judged as taller.

591
00:38:39.670 --> 00:38:44.230
There was what we called a status allegation effect.
He became taller,

592
00:38:44.410 --> 00:38:47.770
but only in the eyes of whom?
Women.

593
00:38:48.400 --> 00:38:51.760
What do you think men rated the guy shorter,

594
00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:57.400
which again speaks to the psychology of intrasexual rivalry,
right?

595
00:38:57.520 --> 00:38:59.740
Both men and women.
Derek Gates,

596
00:38:59.770 --> 00:39:03.490
same sex partners in a way that is perfectly consistent with evolutionary

597
00:39:03.491 --> 00:39:04.660
principles.
In this case,

598
00:39:05.110 --> 00:39:08.380
I am threatened by a guy who may have higher status than me.

599
00:39:08.590 --> 00:39:11.210
So I then agreed them,
how would I then,
oh,
well,
he's driving a Porsche.

600
00:39:11.211 --> 00:39:13.930
You must be a little short rent.
Right?
And so again,

601
00:39:13.931 --> 00:39:18.931
you see how all of this psychology is playing into these basic evolutionary

602
00:39:20.021 --> 00:39:22.990
principles very,
very quickly.

603
00:39:23.500 --> 00:39:25.900
Let me do a few more of these car studies.

604
00:39:26.260 --> 00:39:29.230
This is a study that was done a long time ago.
It's,
it might seem dated,

605
00:39:29.231 --> 00:39:31.720
but it's actually a very powerful,
especially in California where,

606
00:39:32.200 --> 00:39:35.350
especially in a place like the bay area here where a lot of people drive fancy

607
00:39:35.351 --> 00:39:38.380
cars.
So the,
here's what they did in this study at a red light.

608
00:39:38.381 --> 00:39:40.300
This was a field experiment at a red light.

609
00:39:41.260 --> 00:39:45.490
They actually put this as the experimenters either.
It wasn't these cars,

610
00:39:45.520 --> 00:39:48.310
this was then 60 in 1968 so I just put,

611
00:39:48.970 --> 00:39:51.400
I just chose a fancy car versus a non fancy car.

612
00:39:51.940 --> 00:39:56.610
And they simply looked at how long it took a person who was,
wait,

613
00:39:56.640 --> 00:39:58.920
this person doesn't know that they're going to be in an experiment.

614
00:39:59.310 --> 00:40:00.143
How long did it,

615
00:40:00.180 --> 00:40:04.560
how many seconds when the light turns from red to green?

616
00:40:05.320 --> 00:40:09.550
Do you exhibit cues of impatience?
Maybe you'll flick the lights,

617
00:40:09.580 --> 00:40:10.630
maybe you honk.

618
00:40:11.140 --> 00:40:15.340
Of course people were a lot more impatient when the car that was blocking them

619
00:40:15.370 --> 00:40:16.360
was lower stockists.

620
00:40:16.630 --> 00:40:21.630
That again speaks to certain submissive dynamics that happen within social

621
00:40:21.941 --> 00:40:23.380
species.
In this case,

622
00:40:23.381 --> 00:40:27.460
it's happening in a very modern context and the way that we respond,
uh,

623
00:40:27.520 --> 00:40:28.353
on the road,

624
00:40:31.970 --> 00:40:36.230
in this case,
another study,
you know,
more than 30 almost 30 years later,

625
00:40:36.740 --> 00:40:41.740
they kept the status of the car constant that's blocking and then they looked at

626
00:40:42.380 --> 00:40:47.000
whether the car that's being blocked with exhibit greater in patients as a

627
00:40:47.001 --> 00:40:50.330
function of which car was driving.
If I am in a fancy car,

628
00:40:50.550 --> 00:40:54.080
it'll take me less time to be irritated.
And again,

629
00:40:54.230 --> 00:40:56.540
you could see these types of dominance,

630
00:40:56.541 --> 00:40:59.840
submission and interactions across many social species.

631
00:41:02.030 --> 00:41:05.810
Let's move on.
Now.
So far,
a lot of the stuff that I've been talking about,

632
00:41:05.840 --> 00:41:10.070
it seems as though I'm looking at based sexual signaling,

633
00:41:10.490 --> 00:41:12.800
but of course that's not true.
Women,

634
00:41:13.220 --> 00:41:16.910
I mean the human context and not just human contexts across across animals,

635
00:41:17.240 --> 00:41:19.040
women of course,
or females.

636
00:41:19.310 --> 00:41:23.630
And the greater context we'll engage in sexual signaling.
So in this case,

637
00:41:23.780 --> 00:41:27.050
this is a female
chimp,

638
00:41:27.770 --> 00:41:32.770
she will exhibit estrus that she isn't a sexually receptive state by sending

639
00:41:32.811 --> 00:41:35.630
sorts all factory signals that are very attractive to the males.

640
00:41:35.900 --> 00:41:39.590
Her Genitalia will become and gorge will become enlarged.

641
00:41:39.860 --> 00:41:42.410
And this is basically saying that she is sexually receptive.

642
00:41:42.860 --> 00:41:44.480
So I took this idea and I thought,

643
00:41:44.481 --> 00:41:48.320
well how could we apply this principle which manifests itself across many,

644
00:41:48.321 --> 00:41:53.321
many species to the human context and specifically to the consumer context.

645
00:41:53.900 --> 00:41:58.900
And the idea was to look at how women dress as a function of where they are and

646
00:42:00.771 --> 00:42:01.970
their ovulatory cycle.

647
00:42:03.020 --> 00:42:06.220
And what do you think we found when women are in the maximum,

648
00:42:06.221 --> 00:42:10.160
the furthest stage of their menstrual cycle,
when they're ovulating,

649
00:42:10.460 --> 00:42:13.490
they dress more sexily,
they beautify more.

650
00:42:13.880 --> 00:42:17.930
Now that doesn't mean by the way that they look at an oblation show and say,

651
00:42:17.931 --> 00:42:21.410
oh Geez,
did okay,
there's our relation.
Let me dress with shorts or skirt.
It's an,

652
00:42:21.530 --> 00:42:25.820
it's a subconscious mechanism.
I feel more sexy,

653
00:42:25.821 --> 00:42:29.900
I feel less bloated,
I feel more desirable,
my self esteem is higher.

654
00:42:30.290 --> 00:42:35.290
And so all of these mechanisms ensure that a woman is more likely to advertise

655
00:42:36.771 --> 00:42:39.800
herself and the mating market when evolutionarily speaking,

656
00:42:39.801 --> 00:42:41.330
it makes more sense to do so.

657
00:42:42.650 --> 00:42:46.580
Now these studies are unassailable because they're looking at very basic

658
00:42:46.940 --> 00:42:49.940
physiological,
hormonal,
biological facts.

659
00:42:50.210 --> 00:42:54.890
That's why I very carefully selected to do these studies because it makes it a

660
00:42:54.891 --> 00:42:58.370
lot more difficult,
difficult for my social science colleagues to say,
Oh yeah,

661
00:42:58.371 --> 00:42:59.750
but this is just due to learning.

662
00:42:59.900 --> 00:43:04.900
This is just due to culture because they're so basic in their physiological

663
00:43:05.900 --> 00:43:09.620
genesis.
Let's keep going.

664
00:43:13.100 --> 00:43:14.060
Switching gears.

665
00:43:15.440 --> 00:43:19.930
I mean at the end of a successful meeting encounter you,

666
00:43:20.120 --> 00:43:23.030
you might have a child.
And so this is kind of the segue to this.

667
00:43:23.240 --> 00:43:28.240
Here's a study that was done in Mexico and the Yucatan region where when a baby

668
00:43:30.170 --> 00:43:34.310
was born,
people would say,
oh my God,

669
00:43:34.311 --> 00:43:36.530
he looks so much like the father.

670
00:43:37.700 --> 00:43:41.930
Even though objectively that's absolutely untrue,

671
00:43:42.380 --> 00:43:43.191
that's absolutely untrue.

672
00:43:43.191 --> 00:43:48.191
And that the morphological feature of a newborn haven't yet sufficiently formed

673
00:43:49.280 --> 00:43:53.180
for you to be able to objectively say he looks more like the dad or he looks

674
00:43:53.181 --> 00:43:56.810
like more like the mom.
So something's going on.

675
00:43:57.530 --> 00:44:01.100
Not only the people say,
my God,

676
00:44:01.101 --> 00:44:03.380
he looks so much like his father,

677
00:44:04.340 --> 00:44:08.090
but which side of the family is more likely to say it?

678
00:44:08.690 --> 00:44:09.830
The mother's side,

679
00:44:10.670 --> 00:44:15.080
because the mother's side from an evolutionary perspective wants to send a very

680
00:44:15.081 --> 00:44:19.550
clear signal to the father that don't worry,
this is your child.

681
00:44:19.850 --> 00:44:23.110
So before we had the Naa paternity tests and we,

682
00:44:23.150 --> 00:44:28.150
before we had the Maury Povich show where every second episode is exactly that,

683
00:44:29.480 --> 00:44:34.480
we had to come up with a cultural mechanism to assure paternity certainty.

684
00:44:35.221 --> 00:44:40.080
And the way we do that is by fakely stating,
my God,
he looks exactly like you.

685
00:44:42.070 --> 00:44:46.840
And by the way,
if you're wondering why these two gorgeous,

686
00:44:46.900 --> 00:44:50.830
stunning kids are so gorgeous,
that's because those are my children.

687
00:44:52.690 --> 00:44:55.760
This has Luna when she was very young.
And this is Leo [inaudible].

688
00:44:55.960 --> 00:44:56.950
They're now a bit older.

689
00:44:57.670 --> 00:44:59.950
They're in southern California waiting for me to go to the beach.

690
00:44:59.980 --> 00:45:02.380
I came from the beach to come to Google and speak.

691
00:45:04.630 --> 00:45:07.660
Uh,
now I want to tell you a little fun story.
I've,
I've,

692
00:45:07.720 --> 00:45:09.010
I've mentioned this story before,

693
00:45:09.011 --> 00:45:14.011
but I always love repeating it because it demonstrates the power of evolutionary

694
00:45:14.381 --> 00:45:16.900
thinking and understanding our daily lives.

695
00:45:19.660 --> 00:45:20.160
<v 0>Okay.</v>

696
00:45:20.160 --> 00:45:23.910
<v 2>This is the actual,
these are the actual images,</v>

697
00:45:25.140 --> 00:45:30.000
the first images of Luna in Utero.

698
00:45:30.540 --> 00:45:34.870
So for those of you who are parents,
you know that when you,
when you,
when,

699
00:45:35.420 --> 00:45:40.110
uh,
the mother goes to the first time to the Ob Gyn,
usually you get those images.

700
00:45:40.320 --> 00:45:42.900
Most people are very happy and proud.
They celebrate this.

701
00:45:43.110 --> 00:45:46.050
They'll put it up on the fridge.
We were no different.

702
00:45:46.051 --> 00:45:51.051
We put up this image and one day my mother in law comes over to our house,

703
00:45:52.050 --> 00:45:52.883
looks at,

704
00:45:52.990 --> 00:45:55.080
so some people are laughing because they know where I'm going with this.

705
00:45:55.800 --> 00:45:59.850
She looks at you,
Oh my God,
God,
the baby looks exactly like you.

706
00:46:02.880 --> 00:46:07.880
So I made my daughter famous because this was the first case in science where

707
00:46:08.160 --> 00:46:13.160
the maternal side of the family was trying to assure a father of paternity

708
00:46:13.471 --> 00:46:17.010
certainty in utero.
So I said,

709
00:46:17.190 --> 00:46:20.190
should I be worried that you're trying so hard to convince me?
That's that.

710
00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:24.630
That's your daughter didn't go behind the bushes on me,

711
00:46:24.930 --> 00:46:27.690
so I think she looked at me,
she goes,
oh,
enough with your bullshit science stuff.

712
00:46:27.691 --> 00:46:31.740
Shoot,
look at that.
And so it looks like she looks exactly like you.
Oh,

713
00:46:31.750 --> 00:46:34.340
actually we shouldn't know she because we didn't know what sex it was.
It,

714
00:46:34.370 --> 00:46:35.530
it looks exactly like it.

715
00:46:39.080 --> 00:46:42.860
Here's a study that was actually just accepted for publication.

716
00:46:43.190 --> 00:46:47.420
This is Galtee Farah.
This is myself and two other young folks who help us out.

717
00:46:47.750 --> 00:46:51.920
This was,
this is actually the photo of my parents when they got married in 1950.

718
00:46:52.600 --> 00:46:57.590
There's still both alive.
Uh,
this was a study where we looked at,

719
00:46:57.650 --> 00:47:00.500
this is going to speak about paternity certainty.
So you might say,

720
00:47:00.501 --> 00:47:02.840
how do you apply this and Consumer Behavior Watch,

721
00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:10.000
this is the data here is from Israeli weddings where this author along with

722
00:47:11.990 --> 00:47:13.360
these guys.
Then they asked me to,

723
00:47:13.400 --> 00:47:17.030
they asked me to come in on the paper too to help with the evolutionary story.

724
00:47:17.031 --> 00:47:19.850
In this paper,
by the way,
is the longest,

725
00:47:19.851 --> 00:47:24.180
most circuitry newest paper that I've ever had in my scientific career before it

726
00:47:24.181 --> 00:47:25.700
had been accepted for publication.

727
00:47:25.910 --> 00:47:28.730
We've worked on this paper I think for more than five years.

728
00:47:29.260 --> 00:47:31.450
Asked her through the peer review process.

729
00:47:31.750 --> 00:47:36.010
That's how long it took to get this paper through for reasons related to

730
00:47:36.250 --> 00:47:39.310
people's antipathy towards biological based thinking.

731
00:47:39.760 --> 00:47:41.440
So let me explain to you what we did in this paper.

732
00:47:42.460 --> 00:47:45.640
We had data from 30 actual Israeli weddings,

733
00:47:46.330 --> 00:47:51.330
excel sheets where every person who attended the wedding we had how much money

734
00:47:51.731 --> 00:47:54.040
they gave.
So in other words and the Israeli context,

735
00:47:54.100 --> 00:47:58.750
you know you don't give toasters and whatever other appliances you just give

736
00:47:58.751 --> 00:48:03.550
money.
So uncle Mordecai the high $180 a antenna,

737
00:48:04.120 --> 00:48:09.040
$200 and so we had all this data and so we test the two things.

738
00:48:09.430 --> 00:48:12.910
One of them is pretty obvious for you to guess.
The other one is not so obvious.

739
00:48:13.480 --> 00:48:18.480
The first thing we looked at is the size of the wedding gift as a function of

740
00:48:18.731 --> 00:48:23.560
the genetic relatedness between the giver and the bride and groom,

741
00:48:23.650 --> 00:48:26.800
and what'd you think happens?
The greater genetic relatedness,

742
00:48:27.130 --> 00:48:29.800
the larger the gift.
In other words,

743
00:48:29.801 --> 00:48:34.801
people modulate their investment and others as a function of the the strength,

744
00:48:36.030 --> 00:48:39.280
the genetic lineage.
Now you might say,
well,

745
00:48:39.281 --> 00:48:42.610
I could have probably predicted this without being a fancy evolutionary

746
00:48:42.611 --> 00:48:46.600
scientists.
The second hypothesis you couldn't hear it goes.
If you take,

747
00:48:46.601 --> 00:48:50.620
for example,
your four grandparents,
on average,

748
00:48:50.621 --> 00:48:54.490
they share each of them a quarter of their genes with you.
In other words,

749
00:48:54.491 --> 00:48:58.450
the genetic relatedness is 25% if you stop the story there,

750
00:48:58.870 --> 00:49:02.830
they're all equally vested in you,
but there's a second element to the story.

751
00:49:03.220 --> 00:49:07.570
It's not just genetic relatedness,
it's genetic assuredness.

752
00:49:07.960 --> 00:49:11.320
How assured are you over genetic lineage?
Well,

753
00:49:12.040 --> 00:49:15.640
your maternal grandmother is assured of her lineage.

754
00:49:15.850 --> 00:49:18.790
There is no such thing as maternity uncertainty.

755
00:49:19.810 --> 00:49:24.810
Your paternal grandfather has two generations of paternity uncertainty.

756
00:49:25.870 --> 00:49:29.080
Therefore,
we expect the maternal grandmother to invest the most,

757
00:49:29.410 --> 00:49:33.070
the paternal grandfather to invest the least and the two other grandparents in

758
00:49:33.071 --> 00:49:37.780
the middle.
So we took this.
What's the fancy term is differential solicitude.

759
00:49:37.990 --> 00:49:40.840
We took this idea and applied it in the falling away.

760
00:49:42.250 --> 00:49:47.250
Does the matrilineal side of the bride and groom give larger gifts than that

761
00:49:47.291 --> 00:49:51.370
patrilineal side?
And the answer is yes.
This is the one for matrilineal.

762
00:49:51.640 --> 00:49:56.470
This is the one for patrilineal.
So holding genetic relatedness constant.

763
00:49:56.770 --> 00:49:58.390
When you come from the mother's side,

764
00:49:58.540 --> 00:50:01.480
you give greater gifts and when you do from the father's side,

765
00:50:01.960 --> 00:50:04.210
no one would have generated this hypothesis.

766
00:50:04.450 --> 00:50:06.520
If you weren't coming from an evolutionary Lens,

767
00:50:06.550 --> 00:50:09.130
you couldn't have even positive that hypothesis.

768
00:50:12.940 --> 00:50:14.470
I don't want to spend much time on this,

769
00:50:14.471 --> 00:50:17.770
but remember earlier I talked about concilium tree of knowledge.

770
00:50:17.980 --> 00:50:20.200
This is exactly an example of a concilium tree.

771
00:50:20.590 --> 00:50:21.780
When it comes to evolutionary theory,

772
00:50:21.781 --> 00:50:26.290
you start with some general evolutionary principles that are now unassailable.

773
00:50:26.291 --> 00:50:28.280
They've been tested over 150 years.

774
00:50:28.640 --> 00:50:31.700
These lead to what are called middle level theories.

775
00:50:32.090 --> 00:50:36.770
Kin Selection is the mechanism that explains why people or animals invest in

776
00:50:36.771 --> 00:50:41.540
their kin more so than in random strangers.
Based on kin selection.

777
00:50:41.600 --> 00:50:45.710
I could generate hypotheses about genetic relatedness and genetic assuredness.

778
00:50:45.950 --> 00:50:49.670
And then based on that,
I just told you the study that I mentioned.
Okay.

779
00:50:49.940 --> 00:50:50.720
Therefore,

780
00:50:50.720 --> 00:50:55.720
what evolutionary theory does is it provides you with these elegant organized

781
00:50:55.731 --> 00:50:56.780
trees of knowledge,

782
00:50:56.810 --> 00:50:59.990
very much like you would expect in physics and chemistry and biology.

783
00:51:00.380 --> 00:51:03.700
And so one of the arguments that I make and some of my evolutionary minded

784
00:51:03.710 --> 00:51:06.560
colleagues make is that the social sciences,

785
00:51:06.830 --> 00:51:11.150
we'll eventually have to go through the same revolution that biology did too.

786
00:51:11.280 --> 00:51:16.280
They know working biologists says that evolutionary theory is maybe right,

787
00:51:16.551 --> 00:51:17.384
maybe wrong.

788
00:51:17.990 --> 00:51:22.990
There is no chemist chemistry professor who is for the periodic table and some

789
00:51:23.781 --> 00:51:28.400
who are anti periodic table.
The same thing has to happen in the social sciences.

790
00:51:28.550 --> 00:51:31.370
For us to have the same impact and same influence,

791
00:51:31.610 --> 00:51:35.420
we have to agree that there is a set of core knowledge that after a while

792
00:51:35.421 --> 00:51:36.380
becomes unassailable,

793
00:51:36.410 --> 00:51:40.130
and the way you do that is by building these coherent trees of knowledge.

794
00:51:41.040 --> 00:51:45.650
All right,
we're almost done.
Let me just read you a few quotes that are very,

795
00:51:45.651 --> 00:51:49.910
very powerful to really drive the point home of the importance of biology to

796
00:51:49.911 --> 00:51:53.300
everything that we do.
This is an exchange that took place on Charlie rose.

797
00:51:53.301 --> 00:51:55.790
If any of you watch it,
it's usually late at night on PBS.

798
00:51:56.060 --> 00:51:59.750
He brings all sorts of guests and they get into a really fun conversation.

799
00:51:59.780 --> 00:52:04.100
This is Eo Wilson,
who's a very famous Harvard entomologist,

800
00:52:04.160 --> 00:52:07.040
still alive,
one of the biggest scientists of the 20th century.

801
00:52:07.250 --> 00:52:09.260
This is James Watson,

802
00:52:09.590 --> 00:52:14.480
the code discover of the Helix structure of DNA,
double helix,
structure of DNA,

803
00:52:14.750 --> 00:52:17.090
Nobel Prize winner,
and they're talking to each other.

804
00:52:17.600 --> 00:52:19.150
So let me just read it for your psychologist.

805
00:52:19.151 --> 00:52:22.160
Most of the practicing psychologists and theoretical psychologist and the vast

806
00:52:22.161 --> 00:52:25.370
majority of social sciences were really determined in a lot of the intellect.

807
00:52:25.371 --> 00:52:27.560
That wasn't our policy is,
you know,
in our philosophies,

808
00:52:27.800 --> 00:52:31.580
our philosophies have no collection at all to their true nature of humanity or

809
00:52:31.581 --> 00:52:34.520
what human nature is at a biological level.

810
00:52:34.790 --> 00:52:38.570
This is still a huge gap and I believe that we will start to fill that in a way,

811
00:52:39.340 --> 00:52:41.480
uh,
that will be useful in years.
Immediately head.

812
00:52:42.290 --> 00:52:45.410
I see the coming the past century was the coming together of chemistry and

813
00:52:45.411 --> 00:52:49.490
biology.
The century will be the coming together of psychology and biology.

814
00:52:49.660 --> 00:52:54.050
And this is exactly what I do in my work.
I marry psychology and biology.

815
00:52:54.590 --> 00:52:55.820
Now interestingly,

816
00:52:56.210 --> 00:52:59.330
this might interest some of the folks here who are more practitioner oriented

817
00:52:59.810 --> 00:53:04.610
practitioners of business are typically a lot less,
uh,

818
00:53:04.730 --> 00:53:08.330
they exhibit a lot less animus that these ideas then academics,

819
00:53:08.600 --> 00:53:12.050
because academics are typically vested within their paradigms.

820
00:53:12.290 --> 00:53:16.190
And therefore if you come along on your biology horse and if they feel

821
00:53:16.191 --> 00:53:19.100
threatened,
then they will put up resistance while the practitioner,

822
00:53:19.101 --> 00:53:22.340
it doesn't care.
The practitioner simply cares about what works.

823
00:53:22.550 --> 00:53:26.490
So if you're an advertising executive and my theories can help you develop

824
00:53:26.520 --> 00:53:28.830
better advertising appeals,
go for it.

825
00:53:29.220 --> 00:53:33.870
And so here's an example from way back in 1964 this could have been written by

826
00:53:33.871 --> 00:53:36.060
an evolutionary psychologist.
Let me just read it for you.

827
00:53:36.390 --> 00:53:41.100
Because advertising effective advertising is an appeal to human fundamental

828
00:53:41.101 --> 00:53:44.970
needs,
desires,
and motivations as an appeal to basic human nature.

829
00:53:45.180 --> 00:53:48.720
People the world over have the same basic need for food,
clothing,
and shelter,

830
00:53:48.721 --> 00:53:52.070
the same ambitions,
the same egotism and the same temptations.

831
00:53:52.090 --> 00:53:54.690
The setting changes the climate,
the culture,
the idiom.

832
00:53:54.900 --> 00:53:57.000
But the basic human nature is the same.

833
00:53:57.720 --> 00:53:59.460
This is basically evolutionary psychology.

834
00:53:59.461 --> 00:54:03.240
It's looking at these human universals.
And then this one is also say,
this is,
uh,

835
00:54:03.570 --> 00:54:06.300
uh,
the founder of one of the biggest advertising firms of the 20th century.

836
00:54:06.480 --> 00:54:09.000
He's basically saying,
if you want to understand how to communicate,

837
00:54:09.210 --> 00:54:11.040
you have to understand human nature.
Again,

838
00:54:11.041 --> 00:54:15.570
this is very much of a evolutionary argument,
almost done

839
00:54:18.480 --> 00:54:21.820
before I put up before.
Let me just,

840
00:54:23.040 --> 00:54:26.190
sometimes I get people who say,
well,
okay,
but give me some very clear,

841
00:54:26.191 --> 00:54:30.480
practical applications of,
you know,
the fancy scientific work you do.
Well,

842
00:54:30.481 --> 00:54:34.290
here's one which will be the next slide.
If good marketers,

843
00:54:34.530 --> 00:54:37.920
whether they know it or not,
understand human nature well,

844
00:54:38.370 --> 00:54:43.370
if you develop products that are contrary to some basic principles from human

845
00:54:44.251 --> 00:54:48.180
nature,
the product will fail.
Right?
So for example,

846
00:54:48.630 --> 00:54:50.280
Mcdonald works,
well,

847
00:54:51.150 --> 00:54:55.170
not so much because it gets celebrity endorsers to support it,

848
00:54:55.410 --> 00:54:59.010
but it's because it offers you a product that might evolve the gustatory

849
00:54:59.011 --> 00:55:03.300
preferences expect give me fatty,
tasty foods.
Well,

850
00:55:03.301 --> 00:55:07.530
it's not difficult to teach most children around the world to like that product

851
00:55:07.740 --> 00:55:08.760
because again,
as I said,

852
00:55:08.761 --> 00:55:13.350
our taste buds have evolved too to like that because of the environment of

853
00:55:13.351 --> 00:55:15.840
caloric scarcity and caloric uncertainty that we've involved in.

854
00:55:16.350 --> 00:55:20.070
So here's an example that speaks to this idea of romance.

855
00:55:20.071 --> 00:55:24.870
Novels are almost exclusively read around the world,

856
00:55:25.050 --> 00:55:29.160
only by women.
There is no culture.
And if you could find that culture,

857
00:55:29.161 --> 00:55:30.780
send me an email,
I'll make you famous.

858
00:55:31.230 --> 00:55:32.940
You won't find it because it doesn't exist.

859
00:55:33.150 --> 00:55:38.070
There is no culture where men are the predominant consumers of romance novels.

860
00:55:38.430 --> 00:55:40.650
Now you might say,
okay,
so what?
Well,

861
00:55:40.651 --> 00:55:45.651
if you want to understand female sexuality study the archetype of the male hero

862
00:55:48.510 --> 00:55:52.920
and romance novels,
it does the exact same guy.
It's a cut and paste job,

863
00:55:53.610 --> 00:55:56.850
irrespective of which country.
This at very different countries.

864
00:55:56.851 --> 00:56:01.800
It can be Pakistan.
It could be Lebanon,
it could be Bolivia,
it could be Japan,

865
00:56:02.520 --> 00:56:05.490
the male heroes,
the exact same guy.
He's tall,

866
00:56:05.850 --> 00:56:09.270
he's a prince and a neurosurgeon.
He,
he,

867
00:56:09.510 --> 00:56:13.920
he wrangles alligators on his six pack.

868
00:56:14.340 --> 00:56:17.430
He,
he's reckless in his risk taking,

869
00:56:17.610 --> 00:56:21.480
but he could only be tamed by the love of this one.
Good woman.
Boom.

870
00:56:21.510 --> 00:56:24.310
I just read for you every single romance novel.

871
00:56:25.690 --> 00:56:28.960
Not surprisingly,
every single cover,

872
00:56:30.940 --> 00:56:32.770
the guy looks exactly the same.

873
00:56:32.890 --> 00:56:37.240
He never looks like this guy who is this?

874
00:56:37.570 --> 00:56:38.980
Is this some VP at Google?

875
00:56:41.050 --> 00:56:44.560
I shall never be invited again here.
Okay.
Right,

876
00:56:44.590 --> 00:56:49.590
so this is not because there is a conspiracy to promulgate unrealistic images of

877
00:56:52.121 --> 00:56:53.050
masculinity.

878
00:56:53.890 --> 00:56:58.890
It's because marketers understand what in this case appeals to women's evolved

879
00:56:59.590 --> 00:57:02.950
fantasies and they provide a product that is consistent with that.

880
00:57:03.160 --> 00:57:05.230
There was a company,
I don't remember what it was called,

881
00:57:05.440 --> 00:57:07.240
that tried to move away from that.

882
00:57:07.420 --> 00:57:12.420
They wanted to create a loo and new line of Romance novels that broke the

883
00:57:12.761 --> 00:57:17.650
shackles of this.
Guess what happened to that company?
It died.

884
00:57:18.430 --> 00:57:23.430
It died because it had a erroneous view of human nature.

885
00:57:23.530 --> 00:57:27.670
It thought that human nature is infinitely malleable when human nature is

886
00:57:27.671 --> 00:57:30.700
constrained
by biology.

887
00:57:32.770 --> 00:57:37.300
So I'm almost done.
I think maybe two more slides.
This quote right here,

888
00:57:38.860 --> 00:57:42.280
I've always joked that if I ever wrote an autobiography of my scientific life,

889
00:57:42.340 --> 00:57:45.910
it would consist of one page.
Basically this quote.
Why?

890
00:57:46.090 --> 00:57:50.860
Because this quote perfectly captures what I have faced in my scientific career.

891
00:57:50.861 --> 00:57:55.861
This is JBS Haldane who was a very famous evolutionary geneticist and also a guy

892
00:57:56.080 --> 00:57:59.980
kind of like Mark Twain.
He had this beautiful,
uh,
ability with words,

893
00:58:00.370 --> 00:58:01.810
great quips.
He said,

894
00:58:01.811 --> 00:58:05.770
when scientists go through a new radical scientific idea,

895
00:58:06.100 --> 00:58:10.570
they go through four stages of acceptance.
When they first hear about it,

896
00:58:10.600 --> 00:58:13.540
this is worthless nonsense.
This is garbage.
And my case,

897
00:58:14.050 --> 00:58:16.870
you're applying biology to consumer behavior.
What kind of heritage are you?

898
00:58:16.871 --> 00:58:21.400
You're a moron.
Okay,
stage two,
as the evidence starts coming in,

899
00:58:21.970 --> 00:58:26.350
well,
this is interesting,
but it's a perverse point of view,
right?

900
00:58:26.800 --> 00:58:31.060
Stage three,
this is true,
but who cares?
Quite unimportant.

901
00:58:31.390 --> 00:58:35.590
Stage four,
when the paradigmatic wall breaks,
oh,
I always said so.

902
00:58:35.591 --> 00:58:38.020
I've always loved your work doctor.
Sad,
right?

903
00:58:38.500 --> 00:58:42.370
I still have emails and I say this with all due modesty,

904
00:58:43.510 --> 00:58:48.510
I still have emails from guys who had written to me when they were at stage one,

905
00:58:49.540 --> 00:58:51.880
but they don't know that I've kept that email.

906
00:58:51.881 --> 00:58:55.360
Now they're writing to me at stage four.
Will you do us the honor?

907
00:58:55.540 --> 00:58:59.350
But I thought I was a bullshitter who applied biology,
right?
Well,

908
00:58:59.351 --> 00:59:02.950
because that's how science works.
It's an auto corrective process.

909
00:59:03.070 --> 00:59:07.810
Hopefully the good ideas eventually went out
and we're almost done.

910
00:59:08.320 --> 00:59:13.090
Last slide.
Very famous [inaudible] famously stated,

911
00:59:13.480 --> 00:59:16.420
nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution.

912
00:59:16.780 --> 00:59:19.480
And if you walk away with nothing other than this one quote,

913
00:59:19.570 --> 00:59:23.470
I slightly tweak this and say nothing and consumer behavior or in business makes

914
00:59:23.471 --> 00:59:26.690
sense except in the light of evolution.
Here are some of my books.

915
00:59:26.900 --> 00:59:28.130
Thank you very much for your patients.

916
00:59:33.870 --> 00:59:34.530
<v 0>Thank you</v>

917
00:59:34.530 --> 00:59:37.050
<v 1>very much for your time.
Uh,
we're going to go through some questions.</v>

918
00:59:38.580 --> 00:59:40.800
If anyone has any questions for the doctor,

919
00:59:40.920 --> 00:59:43.470
please head over to the mic right there.
If not,

920
00:59:43.471 --> 00:59:46.200
I'm going to jump on the dory and we're going to go from there.

921
00:59:51.620 --> 00:59:53.870
<v 2>That's either really good news or really bad news.</v>

922
00:59:57.400 --> 00:59:59.880
<v 1>Oh,
I got one for you.
Can you talk about,
um,</v>

923
01:00:00.190 --> 01:00:05.190
what male lions and step parents have in common when it comes to children?

924
01:00:05.900 --> 01:00:09.710
<v 2>Oh,
very good.
Yes.
I guess you saw my latest Joe Rogan appearance.</v>

925
01:00:10.230 --> 01:00:12.530
Is that what you're saying?
Meal Pal yet found the bug?
Yeah.

926
01:00:13.010 --> 01:00:17.050
So what Jordan is talking about,
it's a fun idea.
Uh,

927
01:00:17.210 --> 01:00:21.410
when you have a pride of lions,
usually there is one,
two,

928
01:00:21.411 --> 01:00:25.430
three dominant males that's really ruled the pride.

929
01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:31.000
And there'll be these bands of young males who are now looking to have their own

930
01:00:32.391 --> 01:00:36.500
pride,
who will consistently test these dominant males.

931
01:00:36.740 --> 01:00:40.310
Usually they will lose until one day.
Nature catches up to the older guys,

932
01:00:40.540 --> 01:00:44.210
and excuse me,
they're either killed or they're ostracized.

933
01:00:44.540 --> 01:00:49.280
The new males come in,
take over the pride.
What's the first thing they do?

934
01:00:51.090 --> 01:00:52.080
They kill all the cubs.

935
01:00:52.590 --> 01:00:57.590
They kill all the cubs because for a species that is going through engage and

936
01:00:57.720 --> 01:01:00.870
substantial parental investment,
none more so by the way,

937
01:01:00.871 --> 01:01:04.920
the human males across animals from a male perspective,

938
01:01:05.250 --> 01:01:09.930
it makes no sense for me to invest in the genetic package of other males.

939
01:01:10.110 --> 01:01:15.110
Therefore I killed him and that will lead females into coming into estrus.

940
01:01:16.050 --> 01:01:20.520
Now I've joked that that's how you get a female lion into the mood.

941
01:01:20.521 --> 01:01:23.190
You kill her cubs and the way that we,
in the human case,

942
01:01:23.191 --> 01:01:25.680
we play by Barry White music,

943
01:01:26.160 --> 01:01:29.850
some idiot on on on my comments wrote,
that's not how it works.

944
01:01:29.851 --> 01:01:34.830
That's he actually literally took my words as literally true that that's how

945
01:01:34.831 --> 01:01:38.070
you,
of course,
that's not the mechanism,
right?
The mechanism is different,

946
01:01:38.190 --> 01:01:43.170
but it is really what happens.
You'll kill her cubs.
She comes into estrus.
Now,

947
01:01:43.171 --> 01:01:45.120
how do you link that to the human context?

948
01:01:45.540 --> 01:01:48.630
Remember the first book that I mentioned at the start of the talk homicide,

949
01:01:49.140 --> 01:01:52.350
the book that sort of led me on my epiphany to apply evolutionary psychologist

950
01:01:52.370 --> 01:01:53.160
consumer behavior.

951
01:01:53.160 --> 01:01:58.160
While in that book they talk about how the number one predictor of having child

952
01:01:59.581 --> 01:02:04.581
abuse in the home by a factor of a hundred times greater than anything else is

953
01:02:06.391 --> 01:02:08.250
if there's a step parent in the house,

954
01:02:08.910 --> 01:02:13.320
and this has not become known colloquially in science as the Cinderella effect

955
01:02:13.680 --> 01:02:14.910
because Cinderella,

956
01:02:14.911 --> 01:02:19.911
the story of Cinderella is there is the evil stepmother who loves her children

957
01:02:20.850 --> 01:02:25.590
but as differentially nasty through her stepdaughter.
And so again,

958
01:02:25.591 --> 01:02:25.951
here,

959
01:02:25.951 --> 01:02:28.860
this is an example where people get upset because then somebody will raise their

960
01:02:28.861 --> 01:02:32.850
hand,
well,
this is bullshit.
I was raised by his stepfather and he's lovely,

961
01:02:33.020 --> 01:02:36.780
but nobody cares about your personal example.
It's,
it's at the aggregate,
right?

962
01:02:37.110 --> 01:02:39.900
Okay,
they're smoking causes cancer,

963
01:02:39.930 --> 01:02:43.800
but your uncle Joe smoked and he lived to be a hundred it doesn't matter.
Right.

964
01:02:44.070 --> 01:02:46.560
But again,
people have this visceral response against it,

965
01:02:47.040 --> 01:02:52.040
but that's an example of how you apply at behavior and Lyon context to the human

966
01:02:53.071 --> 01:02:56.500
context.
What Tim,
his seat over here,
I'll make sure I've a live question

967
01:02:58.830 --> 01:03:03.600
with the example of the Porsche.
Yeah,
like it's an expensive item and it's,

968
01:03:03.660 --> 01:03:07.560
it sounds really cool.
I think that's kind of like a,
I guess more of a complex,

969
01:03:07.670 --> 01:03:12.310
like there's like a cultural or some sort of higher level,
um,

970
01:03:12.540 --> 01:03:17.070
recognition there.
So like,
but it evokes like a primitive kind of response.

971
01:03:17.071 --> 01:03:17.401
So like,

972
01:03:17.401 --> 01:03:20.850
is there any research into that or anything you'd like you've heard about that?

973
01:03:21.750 --> 01:03:26.190
Because I'm not sure I follow the question.
Can you rephrase it?
Like a Porsche,

974
01:03:26.191 --> 01:03:30.840
like we,
we know a Porsche is inexpensive,
like kind of like sexy,

975
01:03:31.350 --> 01:03:34.650
like object and having one increases status,

976
01:03:35.250 --> 01:03:40.250
but like the recognition that a Porsche is expensive and it sounds really cool

977
01:03:41.671 --> 01:03:46.080
and stuff like that that's like requires,
there's a higher level processing.

978
01:03:46.081 --> 01:03:47.610
So like,

979
01:03:48.770 --> 01:03:51.300
like how does our biological writes things?

980
01:03:51.540 --> 01:03:56.340
So the underlying mechanism is,
of course not the Porsche related,
right?

981
01:03:56.610 --> 01:03:57.390
In other words,

982
01:03:57.390 --> 01:04:02.390
it's in the current cultural context that status has become associated with the

983
01:04:02.761 --> 01:04:07.590
Porsche,
that,
that that's what we get in other cultures.
That might be the number,

984
01:04:07.770 --> 01:04:09.690
the number of cattle head that I own.

985
01:04:10.050 --> 01:04:14.440
And another culture it might be whether I'm a faint famous painter,
right.
Uh,

986
01:04:14.580 --> 01:04:19.170
because Saul was a profoundly unattractive mail by any measure.

987
01:04:19.470 --> 01:04:21.840
He was short,
he was bald,
he was overweight.

988
01:04:21.841 --> 01:04:25.800
He was not particularly attractive in any way yet he had the extremely long

989
01:04:25.801 --> 01:04:28.650
lineup of women who are more than happy to meet with him.

990
01:04:28.800 --> 01:04:33.180
Very beautiful women because he was Picasso.
So the underlying phenomenon is not,

991
01:04:33.210 --> 01:04:36.600
it's not as though we have jeans for Porsche's.
Right.

992
01:04:37.020 --> 01:04:39.540
And the more that we have genes for pornography,

993
01:04:39.960 --> 01:04:43.770
it's that these modern day products,

994
01:04:45.090 --> 01:04:48.720
evolutionary principles that exist for us.
Does that make sense?

995
01:04:49.650 --> 01:04:54.420
We'll do the next live question.
Yup.
So as an,
as an individual and consumer,

996
01:04:54.450 --> 01:04:59.040
uh,
you know,
how does one use this knowledge to,
you know,
protect oneself from,

997
01:04:59.060 --> 01:05:01.770
you know,
stepmothers and advertisers and you know,

998
01:05:01.800 --> 01:05:04.740
mother-in-law's and things like that?
Well,
I mean it's a broad question.

999
01:05:04.741 --> 01:05:08.130
I think to,
to use a cliche knowledge is power.

1000
01:05:08.460 --> 01:05:13.290
So to the extent that each of us has a key,
in this case,

1001
01:05:13.291 --> 01:05:16.440
evolutionary psychology to help us understand human behavior,

1002
01:05:16.800 --> 01:05:21.640
then it's a very powerful thing to have.
I will get students who took my course,

1003
01:05:21.700 --> 01:05:26.500
you know,
10 years earlier,
whole right to me and say,
hi,
professor.
Sad.

1004
01:05:26.540 --> 01:05:29.620
Uh,
I remember the lecture where you're talked about,
uh,

1005
01:05:30.100 --> 01:05:34.920
the evolutionary roots of romantic jealousy and I'm currently having such and

1006
01:05:34.921 --> 01:05:36.850
such fight with my wife because of such that,

1007
01:05:37.060 --> 01:05:39.820
and it perfectly matches what you were.
So in other words,

1008
01:05:40.690 --> 01:05:44.320
it's not as though there is a prescription for every syllable that I author to a

1009
01:05:44.321 --> 01:05:45.790
specific practical application.

1010
01:05:45.791 --> 01:05:49.720
But rather having that knowledge allows us to better understand everything.

1011
01:05:49.721 --> 01:05:54.580
It allows us to understand group dynamics of Google and why I'm going to fight

1012
01:05:54.581 --> 01:05:59.110
for the corner office because it serves as a status symbol.
So in other words,

1013
01:05:59.350 --> 01:06:03.310
I'm giving you a universal key for understanding human nature.
Thanks.
Cheers.

1014
01:06:05.460 --> 01:06:07.900
<v 3>Well,
first of all,
thank you so much for giving this talk.</v>

1015
01:06:07.930 --> 01:06:09.180
It was very interesting.
Thank you.

1016
01:06:09.290 --> 01:06:12.450
I'm going to ask you about one of the studies that you talked about the wedding

1017
01:06:12.451 --> 01:06:14.880
gifts.
Yes.
My question is how do you,

1018
01:06:14.881 --> 01:06:17.130
how do you come from the data that you collected?

1019
01:06:17.131 --> 01:06:21.150
How do you come to a certain conclusion?
For example,
in Lebanon,
I grew up there.

1020
01:06:21.560 --> 01:06:25.800
Um,
you know,
if,
if my granddaughter were to get married,
I would,
you know,

1021
01:06:25.920 --> 01:06:27.840
my granddaughter is more valuable to the family.

1022
01:06:27.841 --> 01:06:32.400
So typically families give more gifts to the female that's getting married then

1023
01:06:32.860 --> 01:06:35.580
and the guy that might be a reason.
There might be like other reasons.

1024
01:06:35.610 --> 01:06:39.990
How do you come to the conclusion that it's an evolutionary thing,
right?
Not,

1025
01:06:40.020 --> 01:06:40.980
not something else.

1026
01:06:41.780 --> 01:06:46.400
<v 2>So several ways to answer that.
One is that as a,
as is the case in all science,</v>

1027
01:06:46.401 --> 01:06:49.280
you have to rule out alternative explanations.

1028
01:06:49.400 --> 01:06:51.770
If you can't rule out an alternate explanation,

1029
01:06:51.771 --> 01:06:54.860
then your data is not as convincing as it otherwise could be.

1030
01:06:55.310 --> 01:06:58.040
But I also showed you how we build these neurological networks,

1031
01:06:58.310 --> 01:07:00.560
these neurological networks,
not,

1032
01:07:00.800 --> 01:07:03.500
not one of the boxes is enough to convince you.

1033
01:07:03.530 --> 01:07:05.900
But once I show you the eight boxes,

1034
01:07:06.140 --> 01:07:08.630
it becomes difficult for you to argue against my position.

1035
01:07:08.870 --> 01:07:11.090
So that's how you do it.
In evolutionary theory,
you,

1036
01:07:11.360 --> 01:07:15.200
you accumulate evidence stemming from many,
many different regions,

1037
01:07:15.860 --> 01:07:19.340
many different lines of evidence that it makes it impossible for you to generate

1038
01:07:19.490 --> 01:07:21.950
an alternative explanation to explain the phenomenon.

1039
01:07:23.340 --> 01:07:24.173
<v 0>Thank you.</v>

1040
01:07:26.430 --> 01:07:28.190
<v 4>Thank you so much for coming today.
It's like,
yeah,</v>

1041
01:07:28.320 --> 01:07:31.070
but amazing to hear your presentation live and not just on podcasts.

1042
01:07:32.030 --> 01:07:35.670
The second my question is through the lens of evolutionary biology.

1043
01:07:35.671 --> 01:07:40.080
How or what is your perspective on people that choose to use a plural pronoun

1044
01:07:40.081 --> 01:07:43.920
such as they are them?
Um,
since evolutionary speaking?
Sure.

1045
01:07:43.921 --> 01:07:45.330
They're born female or male,

1046
01:07:45.470 --> 01:07:48.180
<v 2>right?
So I recently gave a,
uh,</v>

1047
01:07:48.800 --> 01:07:51.440
for those of you who are not familiar with the question that was just Paul is

1048
01:07:51.770 --> 01:07:55.560
this is really sort of a big issue in Canada right now because uh,

1049
01:07:55.650 --> 01:08:00.230
there's a bill that was just tabled and pass called bill sees 16,

1050
01:08:00.800 --> 01:08:05.800
which incorporates gender identity and gender expression as part of the rubric

1051
01:08:05.901 --> 01:08:07.250
of hate crime.
So in other words,

1052
01:08:07.251 --> 01:08:12.251
if you do or say or not say or not do something that could be construed as

1053
01:08:12.711 --> 01:08:17.390
hateful towards say the transgender,
then you could be liable for,

1054
01:08:17.391 --> 01:08:19.960
to a hate crime.
And to the context,
uh,

1055
01:08:20.210 --> 01:08:22.010
for your specific question of gender pronouns.

1056
01:08:23.090 --> 01:08:27.320
A good friend of mine and a colleague by the name of Jordan Peterson got into a

1057
01:08:27.321 --> 01:08:31.640
lot of hot waters because he said he,
and he's a,

1058
01:08:31.730 --> 01:08:35.720
he's a very accomplished scientist who is a tenured professor at the University

1059
01:08:35.720 --> 01:08:38.660
of Toronto in psychology.
He said,
you cannot force me.

1060
01:08:38.990 --> 01:08:40.550
The government can't force me,

1061
01:08:40.880 --> 01:08:45.770
cannot compel me to use specific pronouns,
like [inaudible] say.
And so on.

1062
01:08:46.270 --> 01:08:49.370
Uh,
my Osi appeared in front of the Canadian Center.

1063
01:08:49.371 --> 01:08:53.480
Then I testified regarding that issue.
My position is,

1064
01:08:54.460 --> 01:08:54.860
<v 5>okay,</v>

1065
01:08:54.860 --> 01:08:59.570
<v 2>there's a huge panel plea of personhoods transgendered people exist.</v>

1066
01:08:59.630 --> 01:09:01.970
The non-gendered exists.
The nonbinary exist.

1067
01:09:02.360 --> 01:09:04.820
We should honor everyone.

1068
01:09:05.240 --> 01:09:07.400
We should treat everybody equal under the law.

1069
01:09:07.640 --> 01:09:12.140
That doesn't mean though that I have to celebrate your personhood by you

1070
01:09:12.141 --> 01:09:16.130
compelling me to come up with pronouns that are nonsensical.

1071
01:09:16.131 --> 01:09:21.110
So my personal position is that we're threading on dangerous waters with this

1072
01:09:21.111 --> 01:09:24.020
bill.
My point that during the Senate hearing,
by the way,

1073
01:09:24.021 --> 01:09:29.021
it was every single word that I uttered in today's lecture could be construed as

1074
01:09:30.201 --> 01:09:33.260
a transgression of bill.
See 16.
Because when I'm talking,

1075
01:09:33.261 --> 01:09:35.270
for example about an eight sex differences,

1076
01:09:35.660 --> 01:09:37.220
someone could raise their hand and say,

1077
01:09:37.550 --> 01:09:42.550
never in your course did you mention the transgendered or the non non gendered

1078
01:09:42.621 --> 01:09:45.230
or the Non Binary.
And that marginalizes me.

1079
01:09:45.380 --> 01:09:49.940
So literally evolutionary biology and evolutionary psychology could become

1080
01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:54.710
transgressive of this bill.
So while I respect everyone's personhood,

1081
01:09:55.160 --> 01:10:00.080
that doesn't mean that it should be anti-science.
Okay,
thank you.

1082
01:10:01.250 --> 01:10:05.460
Um,
you have a CV.
It's hard for me to sell on this.
I feel as though like it's,

1083
01:10:06.080 --> 01:10:09.430
I've got this,
you've got nothing.
No,
it's not.

1084
01:10:09.440 --> 01:10:13.650
It's forever on Google then you got to guess I'm sucking in accuracy.
So,
um,

1085
01:10:14.070 --> 01:10:18.920
your book is critical of religion and what are the positive psychological

1086
01:10:18.921 --> 01:10:23.000
aspects of religion?
Yes.
Great question.
Uh,
so in one of,

1087
01:10:23.001 --> 01:10:25.390
in chapter eight of my book,
for those of you who,

1088
01:10:25.420 --> 01:10:30.080
who took a copy that the book is that the chapter is titled Marketing Hope by

1089
01:10:30.081 --> 01:10:32.480
selling lies.
So that might tell you,

1090
01:10:32.600 --> 01:10:36.470
give you a general summary of what I think of religion.
Uh,

1091
01:10:37.730 --> 01:10:41.660
it's very hard to eradicate religion because ultimately we are the only,
uh,

1092
01:10:42.740 --> 01:10:46.220
being that we're aware of that is aware of its mortality.

1093
01:10:46.490 --> 01:10:50.120
And to the extent that we suffer from this existential angst,

1094
01:10:50.420 --> 01:10:55.420
our only solution to it is a subscribe to some religious narrative because all

1095
01:10:56.960 --> 01:11:01.550
religious narratives ultimately offer you a solution to this problem.

1096
01:11:02.480 --> 01:11:04.580
But here I'm torn because on the one hand,

1097
01:11:04.610 --> 01:11:08.450
I appreciate the fact that religion has some functional benefits,

1098
01:11:08.930 --> 01:11:13.620
but on the other hand,
if you truly wish to pursue truth,
uh,

1099
01:11:13.770 --> 01:11:18.060
then maybe believing in wrong ideas,
even though they feel good,

1100
01:11:18.480 --> 01:11:20.840
might not be the a good thing to do.
So.

1101
01:11:22.490 --> 01:11:27.490
So I guess my thinking is few people have the testicular fortitude to be

1102
01:11:29.290 --> 01:11:32.430
nonbelievers because it's a lot easier to be a believer.

1103
01:11:34.590 --> 01:11:38.070
<v 1>What's the most exciting frontier of evolutionary psychology for you?</v>

1104
01:11:38.580 --> 01:11:39.420
<v 2>Oh,
great question.</v>

1105
01:11:40.500 --> 01:11:45.060
I think it is to apply the principles of evolutionary psychology and practical

1106
01:11:45.061 --> 01:11:49.320
fields.
So for example,
in my case,
I apply it and consumer behavior in business.

1107
01:11:49.740 --> 01:11:50.190
Uh,

1108
01:11:50.190 --> 01:11:55.080
now there is the application of evolutionary theory in medicine.

1109
01:11:55.081 --> 01:11:57.510
Now you might think,
oh,
but it hasn't that been done already.
Know,

1110
01:11:58.050 --> 01:12:03.050
most physicians will never hear the word evolution ever uttered because they

1111
01:12:03.871 --> 01:12:07.110
work at the approximate level.
My good colleague who was,
by the way,

1112
01:12:07.111 --> 01:12:09.220
a guest on my show,
Randy Nesay,

1113
01:12:09.270 --> 01:12:13.680
one of the pioneers of evolution of medicine is now trying to make it part of

1114
01:12:13.681 --> 01:12:17.100
the curriculum of medical school that physicians,

1115
01:12:17.101 --> 01:12:20.010
future physicians be trained in evolutionary theory because there are insights

1116
01:12:20.011 --> 01:12:24.180
that come from evolutionary principles that you would typically not have access

1117
01:12:24.181 --> 01:12:26.070
to if you didn't have that Lens.
Uh,

1118
01:12:26.071 --> 01:12:30.990
there's a field now called evolutionary law where you apply principles from

1119
01:12:31.020 --> 01:12:35.640
evolutionary theory to understand whether legal codes are consistent with human

1120
01:12:35.641 --> 01:12:36.474
nature or not.

1121
01:12:36.480 --> 01:12:41.480
So I think the next frontier is to move beyond the study of mating behavior and

1122
01:12:41.551 --> 01:12:46.551
so on is to take the key of evolutionary psychology and use it to unlock

1123
01:12:47.341 --> 01:12:48.480
different practical fields.

1124
01:12:49.550 --> 01:12:51.560
<v 1>Um,
going back to your comment in the car,</v>

1125
01:12:51.620 --> 01:12:55.370
I had to reflect my own personal antidote.
So,
um,
I,

1126
01:12:55.400 --> 01:13:00.080
my first car when I got when I was 18 years old was a 1987,

1127
01:13:00.380 --> 01:13:04.130
uh,
for,
uh,
no,
it was a Volkswagen Fox.

1128
01:13:04.330 --> 01:13:06.260
It had about 200,000 miles on it.

1129
01:13:06.380 --> 01:13:09.470
Went around the sun multiple times I guess or something.
Um,

1130
01:13:09.530 --> 01:13:13.610
the engine was so loud that I could literally have like George Clooney and

1131
01:13:13.611 --> 01:13:17.540
Angelina Jolie in my car with a pile of cash and I couldn't get anyone to come

1132
01:13:17.541 --> 01:13:19.990
inside because the car looks so terrible.
Um,

1133
01:13:20.150 --> 01:13:23.090
but when I would drive to de Anza for Community College,

1134
01:13:23.720 --> 01:13:27.140
I got stopped multiple times for the car I was driving cause it looked like a

1135
01:13:27.141 --> 01:13:27.974
good stop.

1136
01:13:28.250 --> 01:13:33.230
But then once I upgrade my car to like a Ford Focus and put my Santa Clara

1137
01:13:33.230 --> 01:13:34.820
University like alumni plaque on that,

1138
01:13:34.880 --> 01:13:37.700
I haven't been stopped for like 10 years almost.

1139
01:13:38.120 --> 01:13:40.150
So it's really interesting because your book,

1140
01:13:40.151 --> 01:13:42.010
you talked about if you're driving a high end car,

1141
01:13:42.020 --> 01:13:45.530
people are more or less likely to honk when you were a late at a red light

1142
01:13:45.710 --> 01:13:47.150
compared to if you drive a cheap car,

1143
01:13:47.151 --> 01:13:50.780
people will honk right away because it's like,
who is this person?
Um,

1144
01:13:51.110 --> 01:13:52.670
but I wanted to ask you,

1145
01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:57.410
you had a point about how birth order affects our psychology,
right?
And families.

1146
01:13:57.411 --> 01:13:58.580
Can you talk a little about that?
Sure.

1147
01:14:00.020 --> 01:14:04.100
<v 2>So there's this gentleman by the name of Frank Soloway who is a historian of</v>

1148
01:14:04.101 --> 01:14:09.101
science and a Darwinist who came up with an incredible idea to explain birth

1149
01:14:09.171 --> 01:14:11.800
order affects.
Typically when you talk about birth order,

1150
01:14:12.340 --> 01:14:16.200
<v 1>the,
sorry,
should I be looking at you or is it okay to look at everyone?
Yeah,</v>

1151
01:14:16.870 --> 01:14:18.400
I'm just two hands on my,

1152
01:14:19.990 --> 01:14:23.350
<v 2>uh,
typically when you study birth order affects,</v>

1153
01:14:23.530 --> 01:14:28.530
it has studied from the perspective of how parents treat children of different

1154
01:14:29.200 --> 01:14:30.580
orders differently.

1155
01:14:30.730 --> 01:14:33.970
So they might treat the first born differently than the last born.

1156
01:14:34.150 --> 01:14:37.390
And that's at the genesis of birth order phenomenon.

1157
01:14:38.380 --> 01:14:42.940
Frank Salloway flip that whole script upside down.
He argued that?
No,

1158
01:14:43.240 --> 01:14:47.740
actually what drives birth order effects are the children themselves.

1159
01:14:47.741 --> 01:14:49.150
And let me just explain it very quickly.

1160
01:14:49.151 --> 01:14:50.920
It's actually an interesting marketing problem.

1161
01:14:51.280 --> 01:14:55.480
This is the fancy term is called Darwinian niche partitioning hypothesis.

1162
01:14:55.481 --> 01:14:58.300
So it basically works as follows.
When a child is born,

1163
01:14:58.930 --> 01:15:03.930
one of the ways that it has to secure maximal parental investment is to convince

1164
01:15:04.871 --> 01:15:09.160
the parents that it is uniquely different from all the other children.
Okay.

1165
01:15:09.400 --> 01:15:12.970
So there are many different niches I could occupy as a child.

1166
01:15:13.840 --> 01:15:17.080
I could be the good boy,
I could be the rebellious boy,
right?
So when I,

1167
01:15:17.081 --> 01:15:21.790
if I'm the first born,
all of the niches are unoccupied.
Correct.
Therefore,

1168
01:15:21.791 --> 01:15:25.750
I could pick any of them.
If I'm the second born,
I have n minus one niches.

1169
01:15:25.990 --> 01:15:27.520
As I go down the sip ship,

1170
01:15:27.730 --> 01:15:31.660
there are fewer and fewer niches for from which I can,

1171
01:15:32.020 --> 01:15:32.853
I could fill.

1172
01:15:33.250 --> 01:15:38.250
And he argued that that adaptive problem causes later borns to score higher on

1173
01:15:42.340 --> 01:15:43.930
openness to experiences,

1174
01:15:43.960 --> 01:15:48.960
to be greater thinkers outside the box because of this original problem that

1175
01:15:49.181 --> 01:15:50.020
they have to solve,

1176
01:15:50.021 --> 01:15:54.790
which is how could I be maximally different from all my other siblings?

1177
01:15:55.150 --> 01:15:56.650
And whenever I lecture about this,

1178
01:15:56.651 --> 01:16:01.450
I always end with the following and we guess what professor sides,
birth orders,

1179
01:16:03.310 --> 01:16:07.630
boom.
I was destined for greatness cause I'm last porn.

1180
01:16:09.300 --> 01:16:12.520
Uh,
I'm the,
I'm the last of four.
So that's

1181
01:16:12.800 --> 01:16:14.570
<v 1>the explanation for the birth order effect.</v>

1182
01:16:15.030 --> 01:16:18.170
They're still caught my eye cause my brother is like six,

1183
01:16:18.171 --> 01:16:20.480
three amazing athletes and whatnot.

1184
01:16:20.930 --> 01:16:23.600
It was getting recruited for college when he was playing for Bellarmine for

1185
01:16:23.601 --> 01:16:28.370
football.
And I was always known as Gabriel's little brother and I was like,

1186
01:16:28.371 --> 01:16:31.400
crap,
well I'm five,
seven nothing and I weigh nothing.

1187
01:16:31.401 --> 01:16:35.420
So I guess I'll be the one who either makes people laugh or is either like

1188
01:16:35.421 --> 01:16:37.760
studying really hard or whatnot.
The Guy Google here.
Right.

1189
01:16:37.761 --> 01:16:40.010
So it's funny how that plays out.
Um,

1190
01:16:40.910 --> 01:16:44.770
can you talk about the mobility,
mobility and friendship issue in the US?

1191
01:16:44.900 --> 01:16:48.440
How we're constantly relocating,
whatnot.
All right,
how can we overcome that?

1192
01:16:49.330 --> 01:16:54.230
<v 2>So and so that part I was talking about cross cultural differences and</v>

1193
01:16:54.231 --> 01:16:58.160
friendship friendships.
And one of the arguments that I've often heard,

1194
01:16:58.161 --> 01:16:59.690
so for example,
when I was in graduate school,

1195
01:16:59.930 --> 01:17:03.530
most of the graduate students who are not American would always say the same

1196
01:17:03.531 --> 01:17:06.950
thing.
That you could make friends very easily with an American.

1197
01:17:07.490 --> 01:17:11.480
But the friendships seem to be shallower.
They're,

1198
01:17:11.481 --> 01:17:15.380
they're sort of more ephemeral.
And so I was just thinking of,
well,
why is that?

1199
01:17:15.410 --> 01:17:18.350
I mean,
it can't be because Americans are,
you know,
more shallow folks.

1200
01:17:18.351 --> 01:17:19.340
That certainly can be it.

1201
01:17:19.760 --> 01:17:24.760
And so the argument that has been proposed is that the greater geographic and

1202
01:17:26.751 --> 01:17:31.670
physic and socio economic mobility in the United States today,

1203
01:17:31.671 --> 01:17:34.100
I'm an Atlanta,
tomorrow I'm in mountain view.

1204
01:17:34.430 --> 01:17:39.260
Today I am a lower level,
lower economic status.

1205
01:17:39.320 --> 01:17:41.180
Now I'm a DOTCOM billionaire.

1206
01:17:41.960 --> 01:17:46.760
That mobility causes people to have a different outlook on friendships.

1207
01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:51.830
Whereas when you come from the old country,
meaning any Lebanon,
Italy,

1208
01:17:51.831 --> 01:17:56.210
Greece,
India,
typically the place where you're born,

1209
01:17:56.211 --> 01:18:00.620
that little village where you were born is where you're going to typically die.

1210
01:18:00.950 --> 01:18:04.700
And therefore that's closer to the evolutionary environment in which we've

1211
01:18:04.701 --> 01:18:08.660
evolved,
right?
The,
the,
the networks are much tighter there.

1212
01:18:09.040 --> 01:18:11.510
They mimic much more the environment in which we evolved.

1213
01:18:11.690 --> 01:18:14.240
Whereas the environments that we see in our modern environment,

1214
01:18:14.241 --> 01:18:18.140
that they are not the ones that we've evolved in.
That's why in California,

1215
01:18:18.470 --> 01:18:22.520
for every single of the most banal exchanges,

1216
01:18:22.760 --> 01:18:27.290
you have a 600 page legal disclaimer form.
Right?
I remember when we moved from,

1217
01:18:27.490 --> 01:18:30.470
when we moved from Montreal to,
I was a professor at Uc Irvine.

1218
01:18:30.950 --> 01:18:35.720
The first place that we rented a townhouse,

1219
01:18:36.230 --> 01:18:40.430
the rental agreement was probably three times the size of the camp.

1220
01:18:40.431 --> 01:18:43.370
David accords between uh,
Egypt,

1221
01:18:43.520 --> 01:18:48.520
Lebanon and the United States in 1953 we pass the certain fumigation.

1222
01:18:49.100 --> 01:18:53.630
You can't sue us if in 17 generations one of your kids develops cancer.

1223
01:18:53.870 --> 01:18:55.400
You're reading through this,
you're saying,
I mean,

1224
01:18:55.420 --> 01:18:59.300
am I renting an apartment or is this like a nuclear reactors and what's going
on?

1225
01:18:59.870 --> 01:19:04.870
While the reason for that is because of the anonymity of the current environment

1226
01:19:05.751 --> 01:19:10.550
that we live in,
the social interactions have to be mandated by these contracts.

1227
01:19:10.880 --> 01:19:15.410
If you're back in Lebanon,
well,
I just have to shake your hand.

1228
01:19:15.560 --> 01:19:18.920
And that's enough.
Now that's not because the Lebanese are more honorable.

1229
01:19:19.460 --> 01:19:21.470
That's because if I cheat you once,

1230
01:19:21.860 --> 01:19:25.220
that's the last time I'm ever going to cheat you because I'm going to be in that

1231
01:19:25.221 --> 01:19:25.940
environment.

1232
01:19:25.940 --> 01:19:30.940
So you don't need the 7,000 page contract to mandate relationships.

1233
01:19:31.131 --> 01:19:35.810
So I argue that that's what drives the cross cultural differences and the depth

1234
01:19:35.811 --> 01:19:39.310
of friendships.
And for the last question,
um,

1235
01:19:40.100 --> 01:19:43.270
there seems to be a push against ascension in academia.
Um,

1236
01:19:43.430 --> 01:19:44.263
can you talk about that?

1237
01:19:44.270 --> 01:19:47.620
Is this a recent development of what was the first place?

1238
01:19:47.780 --> 01:19:52.370
There seems to be a push against ascension and I guess is this a recent

1239
01:19:52.371 --> 01:19:56.640
development or is this something that's been going on since the beginning of the

1240
01:19:56.680 --> 01:20:01.250
university system?
While it's certainly gotten worse over the past 30,

1241
01:20:01.251 --> 01:20:05.480
40 years?
Uh,
and so for those of you who follow my work,
I mean,

1242
01:20:05.481 --> 01:20:08.930
I really have two hats.
I both have the hat of,
you know,

1243
01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:11.430
an academic who publishes in journals and so on.

1244
01:20:11.820 --> 01:20:16.110
But I also weight in on many of these issues,
the political correctness,

1245
01:20:16.111 --> 01:20:17.340
the trigger warnings,

1246
01:20:17.341 --> 01:20:21.990
the microaggressions and so on that are taking place at the university that that

1247
01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:26.400
is making it very difficult to have interesting debates about controversial

1248
01:20:26.401 --> 01:20:29.490
topics because everybody is afraid that they might offend somebody.

1249
01:20:30.090 --> 01:20:32.790
I and actually the,
the topic of my next book,

1250
01:20:32.850 --> 01:20:36.510
which I'm currently working on is the tentative title is death of the West by a

1251
01:20:36.511 --> 01:20:41.190
thousand cuts.
I go into what has led us down this quagmire.

1252
01:20:41.580 --> 01:20:43.200
So no,
I don't think it's a recent thing.

1253
01:20:43.201 --> 01:20:46.770
I think it's taken about 40 years of horrifying,

1254
01:20:46.771 --> 01:20:51.120
full intellectual wisdom to lead us to the place where we are at and some of

1255
01:20:51.121 --> 01:20:54.900
these movements in case some of you want to know postmodernism,

1256
01:20:55.410 --> 01:20:57.690
everything is relative.
There are no objective truths,

1257
01:20:58.020 --> 01:21:02.670
cultural and moral relativism,
identity politics and intersectionality,

1258
01:21:02.671 --> 01:21:07.440
radical feminism.
Each of these movements are perfect.

1259
01:21:07.460 --> 01:21:12.090
Anti Science,
anti reason positions put them all together.

1260
01:21:12.120 --> 01:21:16.200
You get a cocktail,
you get a launch of utter nonsense.

1261
01:21:16.201 --> 01:21:17.340
That has led us to where we are.

1262
01:21:17.700 --> 01:21:22.700
So I'd like to think that there's a few of us now that are working to fight

1263
01:21:23.041 --> 01:21:24.480
against this.
Uh,

1264
01:21:25.080 --> 01:21:30.080
the news is still not good because I will often receive emails from professors,

1265
01:21:31.860 --> 01:21:35.070
tons of them who will write to me,
you know,

1266
01:21:35.840 --> 01:21:38.130
you were so inspired by you,
thank you for your courage,

1267
01:21:38.400 --> 01:21:43.050
but they'll never say it publicly.
As if supporting freedom of speech,

1268
01:21:43.380 --> 01:21:47.490
freedom of intellectual diversity is a controversial topic,
right?

1269
01:21:48.030 --> 01:21:50.610
They support freedom of speech,

1270
01:21:50.940 --> 01:21:54.450
but they're afraid to state so openly.
So we're in a,

1271
01:21:54.510 --> 01:21:56.890
we're in a difficult position,
but a few of us are,

1272
01:21:56.970 --> 01:22:01.260
are fighting very hard to try to reverse the trend.
Well,

1273
01:22:01.290 --> 01:22:03.450
thank you very much for coming here and speaking.

1274
01:22:04.260 --> 01:22:07.530
You flew across the country to make it here and short notice.

1275
01:22:07.531 --> 01:22:09.330
So if you can give him a round of applause.
