1
00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:10.380
We're going to get started with doctor Sharon Homan,
uh,

2
00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:13.980
who is the president of Sinai Urban Health Institute,

3
00:00:13.981 --> 00:00:18.570
who's going to share with us about why we needed data from the beginning.

4
00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:21.720
Great.
And I want to introduce our colleague Pam Brush,

5
00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.130
an epidemiologist at Sinai Urban Health Institute who leads our,

6
00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.360
what's called our here strategy health equity and assessment research strategy.

7
00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.480
So we're super thrilled to be here at Google with all of you.

8
00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.750
And I just want to express our team's great gratitude to all of our friends and

9
00:00:38.851 --> 00:00:40.380
colleagues,
your family,
Miriam,

10
00:00:40.381 --> 00:00:43.620
who truly has supported us for these hundred years.

11
00:00:43.621 --> 00:00:46.800
And we look forward to another hundred years.

12
00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:50.790
So before we talk a little bit about our two sister institutes,

13
00:00:50.791 --> 00:00:53.700
Sinai community and students,
Sinai Urban Health Institute.

14
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.810
I want to tell you a little bit about what we want to do today,

15
00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.160
but before I do that,
just really want to ground in our mission.

16
00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.570
Everything that we do in our two institutes revolves around our mission and our

17
00:01:06.571 --> 00:01:09.180
mission and vision is so straight forward.

18
00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:12.690
It said our patients and communities thrive and health.

19
00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.760
And just as Marion mentioned,

20
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.420
the neighborhoods that we've served for a hundred years are the stories of

21
00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:21.900
immigrant neighborhoods in the south at Holy Cross hospital,

22
00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.010
Lithuanian Catholic families in the Mount Sinai community,

23
00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.480
Lithuanian and Eastern European Jews.
And over these hundred years,

24
00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.980
lots of different groups have moved in.
One thing that they shared in common,

25
00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.230
our experiences of being socially religious,
politically marginalized,

26
00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:43.710
that histories of racial segregation,
red lining,

27
00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.890
economic hardship and and just appreciating that is so important to understand

28
00:01:49.921 --> 00:01:53.760
what we want to share today,
which is our,
our research strategy,

29
00:01:53.761 --> 00:01:58.740
the paradigm of translating data into action that improves health.

30
00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.510
Because if we're going to carry out that mission and we're a safety net hospital

31
00:02:03.511 --> 00:02:06.360
system with very little financial margin,

32
00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:11.100
it takes a lot just to be treating those trauma victims that we just heard about

33
00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.890
and taking care of people who are under insured.

34
00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.150
But for us to really be about promoting the health of the community,

35
00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.570
we want to do it in ways that are measurable,

36
00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.660
that are meaningful and that are sustainable.

37
00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.370
And we believe the only way to do that is to do it with the communities,

38
00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.640
but doing it with communities that for generations have experienced the kind of

39
00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.830
feelings of being something less than a full participants in society.

40
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.000
It means that the first thing in our research paradigm is building a certain

41
00:02:46.351 --> 00:02:47.340
kind of trust.

42
00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.420
So many of you at Google think about bringing products to market and maybe

43
00:02:51.421 --> 00:02:56.400
you've used knowledge management strategies where you think about at each level

44
00:02:56.401 --> 00:03:01.210
engaging your end users and your consumers and trying to build a useful product

45
00:03:01.211 --> 00:03:05.410
that could go to market and you think about it the lowest level you have the

46
00:03:05.411 --> 00:03:10.411
data and creating data lakes and then you take that through analytic techniques

47
00:03:11.351 --> 00:03:16.351
and began to develop useful information that Kelp and farm you about bringing a

48
00:03:16.601 --> 00:03:21.430
product to market and then that useful information is converted to actionable

49
00:03:21.431 --> 00:03:25.750
knowledge when you tie it in with a knowledge of the food and of the field and

50
00:03:25.751 --> 00:03:28.780
trends.
Similarly,
it's Sui,

51
00:03:28.781 --> 00:03:31.360
we have a knowledge management strategy,

52
00:03:31.361 --> 00:03:36.361
but really we call it a knowledge ecology because at every step it's a very

53
00:03:36.701 --> 00:03:40.360
relational process from the type of data that we collect,

54
00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:41.920
how we collect that data,

55
00:03:41.921 --> 00:03:46.921
how we use in prayer ties our learnings to what action steps that we take to

56
00:03:47.111 --> 00:03:49.750
work with our communities to improve health.

57
00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:54.260
So what we're going to be talking about today is translating data into action

58
00:03:54.261 --> 00:03:57.070
that improves health,
that's built in this paradigm,

59
00:03:57.071 --> 00:04:01.030
this Knology collegey paradigm.
But before we get started on that,

60
00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:04.810
a little bit more about her institutes and Debra,
all yours.

61
00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:08.270
<v 1>Well thank you.
So,
um,</v>

62
00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:12.140
I want to start by saying on this day

63
00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:17.150
at approximately 12 new on a Tuesday,

64
00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:20.810
I was born at Mount Sinai hospital

65
00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:25.340
and I want to say that I'm a proud babies boomer.

66
00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:31.010
So I'm not telling you what year it is,
but I'm a grunt.
I'm a baby boomer.

67
00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:36.380
But,
um,
and I also want to say,

68
00:04:36.381 --> 00:04:41.381
you know that Mount Sinai was there to bring me into this world when I would

69
00:04:46.481 --> 00:04:50.780
have been considered a high risk birth because I was a breech birth.

70
00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:55.580
And there were in that time,
I probably wouldn't be sitting here,

71
00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:01.160
but had it not been the fact that they had physicians that were prepared for any

72
00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:04.600
kind of condition.
I am here today.

73
00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:07.910
I also want to say that,
um,

74
00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:14.950
my parents migrated north from Louisiana and many of my neighbors who,

75
00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:22.610
uh,
and we lived in north Lawndale and,
um,

76
00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:28.300
my parents left Louisiana as those who live next to me for a better life.

77
00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:35.630
And I would say as w Miriam that folks who,

78
00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:38.360
who helped create,
uh,

79
00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:43.390
Mount Sinai hospital and the Jewish community came to Chicago and to North

80
00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:49.520
Lawndale for a better life,
no different.
Um,

81
00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:50.630
I,

82
00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:55.630
my memories of North Lawndale was where we could go outside and play.

83
00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:57.710
Uh,

84
00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:02.710
we talk about the Douglas Park where you could go and sleep at night and,

85
00:06:03.501 --> 00:06:08.060
and um,
in the schools I remembered the red light,

86
00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:11.840
green light game,
uh,
where we,
we came out.

87
00:06:11.841 --> 00:06:15.350
It was no question about our education,
all of those kinds of things.

88
00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:20.600
So I have great memories of growing up in North Lawndale.

89
00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:26.150
Um,
fast forward.
We're here today.

90
00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:31.010
Um,
and let me just say this,

91
00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:36.610
when coming up in north Lawndale and being raised by parents who wanted a better

92
00:06:37.101 --> 00:06:37.850
life,

93
00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:42.200
there were certain things that were non negotiable from my parents.

94
00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:44.960
Education was non negotiable.

95
00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:49.370
We had to get our education during summer.

96
00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:54.920
We had to do two things.
We had two options.
Either go to school or work.

97
00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:59.300
Bottom line,
we didn't play.
We had to get our education.

98
00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:04.460
So I decided I was going to get my education.
There was no,

99
00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:07.370
there was,
it was not acceptable to come to,
uh,

100
00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:12.020
to bring a report card home with a average,
you know,

101
00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:14.810
unless he,
my dad was saying,
did you do your best?

102
00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:19.700
And if my best was a c,
that was good.
But if I could,

103
00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:24.440
if I could look inside of myself and I couldn't say that,
that wasn't my best,

104
00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:26.330
then we had to have a conversation.

105
00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:31.430
And that was the same for many of my neighbors in my community.

106
00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:36.160
Mount Sinai hospital represented,
uh,

107
00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:40.790
a safety net years ago for our community.

108
00:07:40.791 --> 00:07:45.791
It was a place where we knew we could get well if we needed to be well when I

109
00:07:47.541 --> 00:07:50.480
left,
um,
when I left the,
the,

110
00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:52.640
the west side and came back,

111
00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:57.820
I remember driving back and forth,
driving back and forth.
And,

112
00:07:57.860 --> 00:08:00.350
and this is after the,
the,
um,

113
00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:05.380
the riots and things that changed in the community and in the eighties and

114
00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:07.520
nineties,

115
00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:11.240
the biggest issue in our community was the fact that our babies were dying.

116
00:08:12.110 --> 00:08:15.590
That infant mortality was a big issue in our community.

117
00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:17.210
And I don't know about you,

118
00:08:17.630 --> 00:08:22.630
but one of the things that is totally unacceptable is to see a he 11 or 12 or 13

119
00:08:24.291 --> 00:08:26.960
year old,
uh,
give birth to a child.

120
00:08:28.370 --> 00:08:32.480
Because while we can,
from a a clinical point of view,

121
00:08:32.481 --> 00:08:35.750
we're going to make sure that that baby is as healthy as possible.

122
00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:41.200
But the big question that is why I love Mt.

123
00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:45.260
Sinai is,
we always said,
what's going to happen to that baby when he,

124
00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:46.790
when he or she goes home,

125
00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:50.930
it is not acceptable just to give,

126
00:08:50.931 --> 00:08:55.740
to give birth to the child.
Um,
and say,
okay mom,

127
00:08:55.741 --> 00:08:59.250
okay dad,
have a good life.
No,

128
00:08:59.750 --> 00:09:01.770
we got to find out what's that life's going to look like.

129
00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:03.870
We've got to figure out what that picture is going to.

130
00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:05.520
How are we going to paint that picture?

131
00:09:05.970 --> 00:09:10.970
And being a part of a part of Mount Sinai and the kind of board that we have,

132
00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:14.820
um,
they allowed me to say,

133
00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:19.440
and I've been at Mount Sinai for 32 years.
Okay.
That's a long time.

134
00:09:20.130 --> 00:09:24.120
And they allowed me to say,
how are we,

135
00:09:24.121 --> 00:09:28.530
in addition to being able to be the grade to,
to provide great medical care?

136
00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:32.670
How can we assure that beyond the medical care,

137
00:09:32.671 --> 00:09:34.710
how can we create an um,

138
00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:39.920
a way in which we have a strong bridge between the community and the medical

139
00:09:40.441 --> 00:09:43.020
campus?
So 25 years ago,

140
00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:46.420
Sinai community institute was created and,

141
00:09:46.610 --> 00:09:49.950
and for 25 years,
this past June,

142
00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:52.560
we've been doing that faithfully,

143
00:09:53.250 --> 00:09:58.250
is creating programs and resources for the community to make sure that every

144
00:09:58.861 --> 00:10:02.340
baby that's born has a safety net,

145
00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:07.580
that every senior that come this in our community that is protected every child,

146
00:10:08.450 --> 00:10:13.350
um,
that's hungry,
that we know of is no longer hungry.

147
00:10:13.710 --> 00:10:18.330
All the resources that need to be that be that,
that we know we can provide,

148
00:10:18.331 --> 00:10:21.780
that we're providing it,
that partnerships that we create there,

149
00:10:21.781 --> 00:10:25.530
we're creating it.
That's our job,
that's our responsibility.

150
00:10:25.770 --> 00:10:30.770
And that's the beauty of being associated with an institution like Mt.

151
00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:33.180
Sinai hospital,
like Sinai health system.

152
00:10:33.540 --> 00:10:37.720
And so that's my story and I'm going to keep telling it.

153
00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:44.920
<v 0>So needs continued to grow and I think the economic conditions worsened in our</v>

154
00:10:47.511 --> 00:10:48.344
communities.

155
00:10:48.410 --> 00:10:52.850
It became clear that not just in addition to needing these kind of supportive

156
00:10:52.851 --> 00:10:56.330
services,
but that we had to drive structural change,

157
00:10:56.331 --> 00:11:00.710
systemic change and that to do that we really had to document to be able to

158
00:11:00.890 --> 00:11:05.330
share the story of health disparities.
And I think that's when my predecessor,

159
00:11:05.570 --> 00:11:08.450
Dr Steve Whitman,
came about.

160
00:11:08.451 --> 00:11:12.070
Maybe you could share a little bit about what Steve's vision is.
Well,

161
00:11:12.190 --> 00:11:16.360
<v 1>Steve came at the right time because wild,
uh,
Sinai health system in Mt.</v>

162
00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:21.190
Sinai hospital had been providing the types of services over throughout the

163
00:11:21.190 --> 00:11:23.290
years to really change the lives and,

164
00:11:23.291 --> 00:11:28.291
and to help heal our community in a variety of ways.

165
00:11:28.990 --> 00:11:33.310
One of the things that we weren't doing and we needed to do is to be able to

166
00:11:33.370 --> 00:11:37.810
measure our outcomes,
to really be able to say how we're doing it,

167
00:11:37.990 --> 00:11:40.210
to tell our story in a different way.

168
00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:43.420
And so by having Steve who's very,

169
00:11:43.421 --> 00:11:47.290
very passionate about what we're calling health disparity issues,

170
00:11:47.291 --> 00:11:50.050
to really bring it to the forefront,
he,

171
00:11:50.170 --> 00:11:54.020
he really put a different angle on

172
00:11:54.020 --> 00:11:56.650
<v 0>it.
Things that we really did think about.</v>

173
00:11:56.651 --> 00:12:01.651
And so he really helped us understand how place and race really absolutely

174
00:12:01.991 --> 00:12:06.700
matter in the equation.
And I think it's,
it's his legacy that helped us,

175
00:12:06.910 --> 00:12:11.200
uh,
be the institute we are today.
And,
uh,
when we look at our team today,

176
00:12:11.201 --> 00:12:14.500
we have this incredibly diverse group of scientists,

177
00:12:14.501 --> 00:12:19.120
trained from some of the best institutions,
Notre Dame,
Duke,
University of Iowa,

178
00:12:19.121 --> 00:12:20.380
University of Minnesota.

179
00:12:20.381 --> 00:12:25.381
So we had this rock solid group of research scientists and health educators,

180
00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:30.250
program developers,
effective communication people and what we're not,

181
00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:32.110
we're not a back shop operation.

182
00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:37.260
We're definitely in the forefront in the community working as leaders to develop

183
00:12:38.051 --> 00:12:42.700
and implement and evaluate,
come up with new innovative solutions,

184
00:12:42.701 --> 00:12:44.530
high tech,
high touch,

185
00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:49.680
high community solutions that we hope can bring about greater equity and improve

186
00:12:50.681 --> 00:12:53.260
health.
But to understand what we're doing,

187
00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:58.090
we really have to understand this idea of health equity.
So,

188
00:12:58.340 --> 00:12:58.750
um,

189
00:12:58.750 --> 00:13:03.750
one of the things that we like to tell is if you just go from where we are here

190
00:13:04.631 --> 00:13:08.290
in the West loop and you think about just going five miles west,

191
00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:13.500
that we experience a decrease in life expectancy of 16 years and that's age

192
00:13:13.901 --> 00:13:16.450
adjusted rates,
adjusted life expectancy.

193
00:13:16.660 --> 00:13:19.360
So we say that we have this huge gap.

194
00:13:19.540 --> 00:13:22.810
What are those underlying issues?
Uh,

195
00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:27.520
economic depression,
race,
gender,
immigration status,

196
00:13:27.850 --> 00:13:31.120
all of these characteristics.
Um,

197
00:13:31.210 --> 00:13:36.210
cause our communities to experience less health and those health disparities do

198
00:13:36.911 --> 00:13:39.490
more than just add burden of,

199
00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:43.130
of difficult situations in homes.
Uh,

200
00:13:43.131 --> 00:13:46.360
kids with unmanaged asthma,
uncontrolled diabetes.

201
00:13:46.510 --> 00:13:49.960
But it really erodes the trust in our community that,

202
00:13:50.020 --> 00:13:53.170
that the rest of the city of Chicago cares about them.

203
00:13:53.470 --> 00:13:57.670
And to churn this around,
we really believe that we have to do it.

204
00:13:57.671 --> 00:13:59.200
Think systematically.

205
00:13:59.410 --> 00:14:04.270
And part of that systematic change is getting at these underlying health

206
00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:06.350
inequities and making those right.

207
00:14:06.351 --> 00:14:09.800
And Pam's going to share a little bit about the language that we use.

208
00:14:09.801 --> 00:14:11.650
Your mouth equity and disparity,

209
00:14:12.350 --> 00:14:13.760
<v 2>right?
So at its heart,</v>

210
00:14:13.761 --> 00:14:18.761
suis mission is to achieve health equity across communities.

211
00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:21.710
So what we mean by health equity is that all people,

212
00:14:21.711 --> 00:14:25.670
all communities have access and opportunity to reach their full potential of

213
00:14:25.671 --> 00:14:28.400
health.
And in,
in terminology wise,

214
00:14:28.401 --> 00:14:32.150
we call health inequities are these created barriers?
So structural,

215
00:14:32.151 --> 00:14:36.620
systematic barriers,
things like community disinvestment,
um,

216
00:14:36.740 --> 00:14:37.820
food insecurity,

217
00:14:37.821 --> 00:14:42.821
discrimination that lead to one group persistently having worse health outcomes

218
00:14:43.281 --> 00:14:48.080
than another group.
And then we measure those in what we call health disparities.

219
00:14:48.081 --> 00:14:51.530
So for an example of a disparity we know of,
um,

220
00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:55.100
African American women who are diagnosed with breast cancer are more likely to

221
00:14:55.101 --> 00:14:59.890
die then non Hispanic white woman.
And that is not a genetic predisposition.

222
00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:02.240
That is because of these inequities that exist.

223
00:15:02.450 --> 00:15:06.980
And Sue he's mission is really to use data in innovative solutions to try to

224
00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:09.440
bridge that gap and solve some of these inequities.
Yeah.

225
00:15:09.450 --> 00:15:12.270
<v 0>Is that we see,
I love the work of my predecessor,</v>

226
00:15:12.271 --> 00:15:17.271
Dr Steve Whitman did because he really helped us understand this idea of health

227
00:15:17.491 --> 00:15:19.980
disparities.
But to take action,

228
00:15:19.981 --> 00:15:23.190
we need to think of tangible health inequities,

229
00:15:23.370 --> 00:15:27.270
those things that get in the way that we can remove those barriers.

230
00:15:27.271 --> 00:15:29.970
We can improve the transit system at Mount Sinai.

231
00:15:30.090 --> 00:15:33.390
So not only patients can get on the bus and make it to Sinai,

232
00:15:33.570 --> 00:15:35.130
they can actually get home.
Again,

233
00:15:35.340 --> 00:15:40.340
we can find ways to get grocery stores built in our community or other sorts of,

234
00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:44.220
uh,
Amazon,
Google solutions to the issues of food security.

235
00:15:44.550 --> 00:15:48.930
But basically when we talk about removing these health equity barriers,

236
00:15:49.020 --> 00:15:53.580
we need to think about three concepts.
And these are the concepts of space,

237
00:15:53.581 --> 00:15:56.670
power and authority.
Of course space.

238
00:15:56.850 --> 00:16:00.690
We need conditions where people can live,
work and learn.

239
00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:04.770
We need green space.
We need grocery stores,
good transportation,

240
00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:07.230
effective policing,
safe streets.

241
00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:12.270
So that space that makes a lot of sense.
Power makes a lot of sense.

242
00:16:12.450 --> 00:16:16.980
We need partners,
business partners,
commercial partners,
civic partners,

243
00:16:17.130 --> 00:16:21.570
ways that we can move the needle on improving the health conditions and

244
00:16:21.571 --> 00:16:24.960
eliminating some of these health barriers,
these inequities.

245
00:16:25.230 --> 00:16:30.180
But most important,
we need authority.
And that's not authority over.

246
00:16:30.450 --> 00:16:35.450
It's the opportunity for individuals and communities to be the author of their

247
00:16:35.701 --> 00:16:37.200
own life and story.

248
00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:41.040
And this is really yet what's root of our research model.

249
00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:44.130
This idea that we create this platform of trust.

250
00:16:44.310 --> 00:16:46.200
And when we have trusting relationships,

251
00:16:46.350 --> 00:16:51.240
we can effectively engage our community members and community organizations and

252
00:16:51.390 --> 00:16:56.180
partners and beginning to look at the data,
make sense of it,
prayer ties,

253
00:16:56.190 --> 00:16:57.180
what we're going to work on,

254
00:16:57.360 --> 00:17:02.360
find solutions that can be really adapt it to the particular community and their

255
00:17:03.271 --> 00:17:04.104
needs.

256
00:17:04.860 --> 00:17:06.380
<v 2>So that leads into,
uh,</v>

257
00:17:06.420 --> 00:17:09.690
one example of how we were really doing this on the ground today.

258
00:17:09.691 --> 00:17:14.691
And this is our Sinai survey 2.0 and so this is actually a follow up survey to

259
00:17:14.731 --> 00:17:18.210
survey we did in 2002.
Uh,
and like that survey,

260
00:17:18.211 --> 00:17:22.380
it really focuses on the social factors that influence people's health,

261
00:17:22.410 --> 00:17:24.060
where they live,
work and play.

262
00:17:24.810 --> 00:17:29.520
So this survey was conducted in nine community areas across Chicago.
Uh,

263
00:17:29.521 --> 00:17:32.190
and many of these areas are served by Sinai health system,

264
00:17:32.191 --> 00:17:36.720
but we actually added some other areas to get up our sample size to do some

265
00:17:36.721 --> 00:17:39.120
racial and ethnic differences analyses,

266
00:17:39.121 --> 00:17:43.380
particularly in Mexican and Puerto Rican populations.

267
00:17:43.950 --> 00:17:48.630
Now key to engaging the community in this process was our community advisory

268
00:17:48.631 --> 00:17:51.900
committee.
So they saw us through every step of the survey.

269
00:17:51.901 --> 00:17:55.680
They literally oversaw the design of the survey,
uh,

270
00:17:55.710 --> 00:17:58.440
the administration of it and its dissemination.

271
00:17:58.740 --> 00:18:02.130
It was comprised of at least two individuals from each of the surveyed

272
00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:05.250
communities and just an example of of what they did.

273
00:18:05.460 --> 00:18:09.630
So we came to them with a list of 700 questions related to health and they

274
00:18:09.631 --> 00:18:11.700
brought us down to 500 questions,

275
00:18:11.701 --> 00:18:14.690
really tweaking them to be culturally appropriate,
uh,

276
00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:19.080
and also to be the most relevant questions for their communities.
In addition,

277
00:18:19.081 --> 00:18:22.740
we had them add questions so we weren't going to ask about intimate partner

278
00:18:22.741 --> 00:18:26.040
violence and they insisted we ask about intimate partner violence.

279
00:18:26.250 --> 00:18:29.970
They wanted us to ask about school closings in the area and they also wanted us

280
00:18:29.971 --> 00:18:33.780
to ask extensively about discrimination in,

281
00:18:33.990 --> 00:18:38.220
in their communities.
Now as an epidemiologist,

282
00:18:38.550 --> 00:18:40.560
in addition to the community play piece,

283
00:18:40.561 --> 00:18:43.230
we also tried to make sure it was a very rigorous survey.

284
00:18:43.231 --> 00:18:47.850
So we did partner with the University of Illinois Survey Research Laboratory to

285
00:18:47.851 --> 00:18:52.230
build a multistage sampling approach so that we could statistically estimate,

286
00:18:52.530 --> 00:18:57.000
uh,
health outcomes and factors by community area.
And lastly,

287
00:18:57.001 --> 00:19:01.440
we did the survey face to face in people's homes,
in Spanish and in English.

288
00:19:01.620 --> 00:19:05.890
And that was done very pointedly.
It's because we know that typical survey form,

289
00:19:05.891 --> 00:19:10.890
so online telephone paper tend to miss some of the most marginalized

290
00:19:10.891 --> 00:19:14.070
communities,
low income people and communities of color.

291
00:19:14.250 --> 00:19:17.490
And it was an incredibly important that the survey reached those groups that are

292
00:19:17.491 --> 00:19:19.800
oftentimes missed in other survey forms

293
00:19:20.020 --> 00:19:23.290
<v 0>as well as building the trust in the community.
Right?
Yes.
Right.</v>

294
00:19:24.910 --> 00:19:25.151
Great.

295
00:19:25.151 --> 00:19:28.780
So Pam is going to share a few of the key results and we're going to focus on

296
00:19:28.781 --> 00:19:31.600
three topics.
Uh,
posttraumatic stress disorder,

297
00:19:31.601 --> 00:19:33.700
food insecurity in neighborhood safety.

298
00:19:34.150 --> 00:19:37.570
And just want to point out is Pam described some methods,

299
00:19:37.750 --> 00:19:39.910
both of the analysis and the findings,

300
00:19:39.911 --> 00:19:43.030
but also how we're going to disseminate those research products.

301
00:19:43.031 --> 00:19:45.310
Everything that we try to do,

302
00:19:45.311 --> 00:19:48.850
the prioritization of what we are sharing with you,
even today,

303
00:19:49.130 --> 00:19:52.420
air ways in which we're trying to build the trust and motivation of our

304
00:19:52.421 --> 00:19:54.640
communities and get their buy in.

305
00:19:54.641 --> 00:19:59.330
So the one to use these findings and results to help push forward for a change

306
00:19:59.331 --> 00:20:03.610
in,
um,
motivation to change.
And I,
I know Deborah,

307
00:20:03.611 --> 00:20:05.230
just the past couple of weeks,

308
00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:09.400
your group in North Lawndale has been using these surveys to do just that and

309
00:20:09.401 --> 00:20:10.750
some of our tools.

310
00:20:11.110 --> 00:20:14.190
<v 1>Yes,
yes.
Um,
one to the,
um,</v>

311
00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:16.650
it's an organization called the north Lawndale triple c,

312
00:20:16.651 --> 00:20:21.030
which is a community collaborative collaborative that has been actually using is

313
00:20:21.050 --> 00:20:22.080
a bottom up approach.

314
00:20:22.081 --> 00:20:27.081
It's a organization that was formed by the community where they wanted to come

315
00:20:27.211 --> 00:20:32.211
up with a plan for what North Lawndale looks like 50 years from now because none

316
00:20:32.971 --> 00:20:33.810
had been done.

317
00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:38.160
And so they asked me if I would serve as the chair of the health and wellness

318
00:20:38.161 --> 00:20:42.570
committee committee.
So what I felt was important is,

319
00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:45.380
well,
let's find out what the,
the,

320
00:20:45.390 --> 00:20:50.390
the condition of community is around health status.

321
00:20:50.591 --> 00:20:55.591
So what we did is we took the data that came out of this study and we shared it

322
00:20:56.741 --> 00:21:01.741
with the committee and the committee is made up of community stakeholders.

323
00:21:02.020 --> 00:21:07.020
And from that we were able to come up with a plan that is reflective of the data

324
00:21:08.171 --> 00:21:12.370
that was shared from,
um,
from the,
um,
the study.

325
00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:17.320
So it was really a wonderful plan that actually will be unveiled by the,

326
00:21:17.860 --> 00:21:19.600
by the committee in November.

327
00:21:20.140 --> 00:21:23.680
And we're going to see that some of those findings are quite startling.
Yeah.

328
00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:24.480
Right.

329
00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:29.480
<v 2>So one of the things that we found and was quite striking to us was the immense</v>

330
00:21:30.601 --> 00:21:34.560
mental health burden in the communities and particularly in relation to PTSD.

331
00:21:34.980 --> 00:21:39.810
And so we asked respondents if a health care provider or doctor had ever told

332
00:21:39.811 --> 00:21:44.520
them that they have PTSD.
And here you can see the results of of diagnosed PTSD.

333
00:21:44.521 --> 00:21:48.630
So they were actually quite high and we see in three communities we're

334
00:21:48.631 --> 00:21:52.410
approaching about one in 10 adults having been diagnosed with PTSD.

335
00:21:52.620 --> 00:21:54.930
And mind you there were,

336
00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:58.890
it was basically an entirely civilian population that we were surveying.

337
00:21:59.670 --> 00:22:03.360
The important thing we know also is that these communities have a lot of

338
00:22:03.361 --> 00:22:07.530
barriers to healthcare,
particularly mental health care services.

339
00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:12.800
So we asked a series of questions to about current PTSD symptoms in the past

340
00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:17.070
month and here we see the results of that assessment.

341
00:22:17.580 --> 00:22:22.580
And so we find that the burden was quite higher if we asked about it in terms of

342
00:22:23.821 --> 00:22:28.650
current PTSD symptoms rather than requiring someone to go to a doctor to report

343
00:22:28.651 --> 00:22:30.510
that they've been diagnosed with PTSD.

344
00:22:30.930 --> 00:22:33.570
And here you see men on the left and women on the right.

345
00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:37.950
And in two of our communities we had about one out of four adults reporting

346
00:22:37.951 --> 00:22:41.190
current PTSD symptoms and just in the past month.

347
00:22:41.610 --> 00:22:43.710
So this is quite surprising to us,

348
00:22:43.711 --> 00:22:46.500
but I know an and some dissemination activities,

349
00:22:46.501 --> 00:22:49.620
it wasn't actually surprising to our communities.
And Deborah,

350
00:22:49.621 --> 00:22:51.720
I know it wasn't necessarily surprising to you,

351
00:22:51.721 --> 00:22:54.690
so it might be good to share some of your thoughts on these phones.

352
00:22:55.030 --> 00:22:56.260
<v 1>It's still a stigma,</v>

353
00:22:56.261 --> 00:23:01.261
particularly in the minority communities around seeking out care around the

354
00:23:01.301 --> 00:23:04.230
mental health issues.
And so,
um,

355
00:23:04.540 --> 00:23:08.440
that's something that our committee,
we are addressing.
As a matter of fact,

356
00:23:08.710 --> 00:23:10.210
we just did,
um,

357
00:23:10.570 --> 00:23:14.830
at a conference in two of our elementary schools,

358
00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:19.420
um,
two weeks ago,
uh,
focused on,
uh,

359
00:23:19.450 --> 00:23:22.270
with our own trauma informed care with our youth.

360
00:23:22.271 --> 00:23:27.271
And it was phenomenal because we figured we need to start early to deal with the

361
00:23:27.730 --> 00:23:32.730
how trauma is affecting our children and the and working with our youth as early

362
00:23:34.091 --> 00:23:34.924
as possible.

363
00:23:35.320 --> 00:23:39.940
We are walking around with a lot of pain and we need to figure out how do we

364
00:23:39.941 --> 00:23:40.960
address that pain.

365
00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:44.260
<v 2>So in addition to the outcomes,</v>

366
00:23:44.261 --> 00:23:48.710
we also asked a bunch of questions related to factors that might influence

367
00:23:48.711 --> 00:23:51.680
health,
health and particularly social factors.

368
00:23:51.681 --> 00:23:56.000
So we ask things about police encounters,
discrimination,
religion,

369
00:23:56.001 --> 00:23:59.330
social support,
neighborhood safety,
and the list goes on.

370
00:23:59.570 --> 00:24:03.440
But one of the things I want to cover that was particularly poignant in these

371
00:24:03.441 --> 00:24:05.030
communities is food insecurity.

372
00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:08.360
And so for those of you unfamiliar with Food Insecurity,

373
00:24:08.361 --> 00:24:12.830
it's a measure of access to not only affordable food but healthy,

374
00:24:12.831 --> 00:24:13.850
nutritious food.

375
00:24:14.210 --> 00:24:18.440
And we used the U S DA's validated scales so that we could compare it to other

376
00:24:18.441 --> 00:24:19.850
surveys across the country.

377
00:24:20.090 --> 00:24:22.880
And here you see some of the questions and what they really get at.

378
00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:25.100
And in our communities,

379
00:24:25.310 --> 00:24:29.870
we saw that all but one were well above the u s rate for household food

380
00:24:29.871 --> 00:24:32.480
insecurity in the past year.
In fact,

381
00:24:32.481 --> 00:24:36.110
in three of our communities we were approaching one and two households being

382
00:24:36.111 --> 00:24:40.760
food insecure.
In addition,
looking at this by race and ethnicity,

383
00:24:40.761 --> 00:24:45.080
we found that our non Hispanic black households were three times as likely and

384
00:24:45.081 --> 00:24:48.890
are Puerto Rican and Mexican households about two times as likely to be food

385
00:24:48.891 --> 00:24:51.020
insecure as white households.

386
00:24:51.410 --> 00:24:55.070
So this is incredibly important as a health care provider to see what our

387
00:24:55.071 --> 00:24:57.830
patients were facing it at home.
You know,

388
00:24:57.831 --> 00:25:01.190
a lot of our providers are trying to get people to stay on to complex medical

389
00:25:01.191 --> 00:25:06.080
schedules,
get them onto prescriptions for their different health needs.

390
00:25:06.350 --> 00:25:09.770
But it's important to remember that if you can't get food on the table,

391
00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:12.470
it's oftentimes hard to meet those clinical guidelines.

392
00:25:12.550 --> 00:25:16.090
<v 0>Yeah,
you,
you look at,
in our community,
north Lawndale,</v>

393
00:25:16.150 --> 00:25:18.970
largely African American community where Mount Sinai sits,

394
00:25:19.270 --> 00:25:21.130
and as we see from the statistics,

395
00:25:21.370 --> 00:25:26.020
about half of the African American families in those communities are food

396
00:25:26.021 --> 00:25:28.270
insecure.
And you remember back to what that meant,

397
00:25:28.300 --> 00:25:31.450
that Pam shared with us from the,
from the FDA instrument,

398
00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:34.510
this means they go days without any food.

399
00:25:34.750 --> 00:25:39.220
And then I just wanted to run that by at Mount Sinai are the folks that are in

400
00:25:39.221 --> 00:25:41.710
nutrition and dietetics.
And I asked,
well,

401
00:25:41.740 --> 00:25:46.120
what's the situation particularly for our patients that have complex medical

402
00:25:46.300 --> 00:25:51.070
conditions are have come in for an emergency episode related to their diabetes.

403
00:25:51.340 --> 00:25:53.020
So what is it like?
And she said,
well,

404
00:25:53.140 --> 00:25:58.140
and they said that almost three fourths of our patients leave and they leave

405
00:25:59.710 --> 00:26:04.210
with a nutritional issue.
They're undernourished or malnourished.

406
00:26:04.211 --> 00:26:07.300
They'd been in the hospital,
they've lost weight,

407
00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:11.470
and they go back and they don't have a ready access to food.

408
00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:15.130
There are no solutions in the community,
there aren't grocery stores.

409
00:26:15.131 --> 00:26:17.260
This is a huge issue.
And I know Debra,

410
00:26:17.261 --> 00:26:21.640
it's something you're looking as part of the quality of life plan and in North

411
00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:22.473
Lawndale,

412
00:26:23.030 --> 00:26:27.380
<v 2>right?
So this data was incredibly important to guide our practice,</v>

413
00:26:27.381 --> 00:26:28.670
to guide our interventions.

414
00:26:28.970 --> 00:26:33.970
But one of the key pieces of the survey was that we involve the community along

415
00:26:34.761 --> 00:26:38.420
the way.
And one of the key ways we did this was in our dissemination.

416
00:26:38.421 --> 00:26:43.421
So one of our primary dissemination methods were to coast community with topics

417
00:26:44.791 --> 00:26:49.140
that were selected by our community advisory committee and get residents

418
00:26:49.170 --> 00:26:51.420
feedback on the context around these numbers.

419
00:26:51.421 --> 00:26:56.220
So these were round tabor table discussions in English and in Spanish.

420
00:26:56.340 --> 00:26:59.940
We kind of did a data training at the beginning where we communicated to

421
00:26:59.941 --> 00:27:02.280
individuals how to,
how to understand the data,

422
00:27:02.580 --> 00:27:05.580
and then we asked does this resonate?
What's the context?

423
00:27:05.940 --> 00:27:10.410
And these were incredibly important to us understanding the different narratives

424
00:27:10.411 --> 00:27:14.190
across our communities.
So I'll give one example here.
Uh,

425
00:27:14.191 --> 00:27:17.100
so this is the story of North Lawndale and West Englewood.

426
00:27:17.310 --> 00:27:20.550
So these are two communities on the west and south sides of Chicago,

427
00:27:20.551 --> 00:27:24.510
about eight miles apart.
Uh,
and they look pretty similar.

428
00:27:24.511 --> 00:27:29.160
Demographically they're about the same size and they're both predominantly non

429
00:27:29.161 --> 00:27:30.900
Hispanic black populations.

430
00:27:31.770 --> 00:27:36.570
They also have quite low median incomes.
Compare it to the city as a whole.

431
00:27:37.260 --> 00:27:42.210
And their clinical access is pretty much the same.
So beyond these statistics,

432
00:27:42.510 --> 00:27:46.080
um,
you know,
they were getting access to screenings at appropriate times,

433
00:27:46.081 --> 00:27:46.914
et cetera.

434
00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:51.150
So your thought might be that all of their other outcomes might be pretty

435
00:27:51.151 --> 00:27:54.630
similar or,
or you know like everything probably looks about the same.

436
00:27:55.050 --> 00:27:58.380
But we also asked about these social factors and one of the things we asked

437
00:27:58.381 --> 00:27:59.430
about with safety,

438
00:27:59.790 --> 00:28:03.840
and we found that in north Lawndale about 16% of adults felt unsafe walking

439
00:28:03.841 --> 00:28:07.020
alone in their house,
in their neighborhood during the day.

440
00:28:07.260 --> 00:28:11.730
But that in west Englewood it was one in three.
So as the data people we are,

441
00:28:11.731 --> 00:28:15.600
we dug into it and we were thinking that it probably was related to crime,

442
00:28:16.170 --> 00:28:20.250
but we actually found that north Lawndale had higher rates of violent crime than

443
00:28:20.251 --> 00:28:21.150
West Englewood.

444
00:28:21.300 --> 00:28:24.660
So we weren't quite sure what was going on with the numbers and we didn't have

445
00:28:24.661 --> 00:28:27.780
additional numbers to help answer these questions.

446
00:28:28.170 --> 00:28:33.170
And so we discussed this at our forums and overwhelmingly this is what we heard

447
00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:36.480
at our west Englewood forum.
So things like,

448
00:28:36.510 --> 00:28:41.510
it feels like Inglewood is a target to just report the bad stuff and the media

449
00:28:41.581 --> 00:28:44.670
has constant images of violence,
but people don't see that.

450
00:28:44.910 --> 00:28:48.150
If we're constantly slammed with this image will be looking over our shoulders

451
00:28:48.180 --> 00:28:49.860
rather than reaching out to each other.

452
00:28:50.250 --> 00:28:53.940
And so working in health promotion and capacity building in this neighborhood,

453
00:28:53.941 --> 00:28:57.900
it was incredibly important to hear this message because we don't oftentimes

454
00:28:57.901 --> 00:29:02.280
think about the media and its influence on the factors that influence health.

455
00:29:02.760 --> 00:29:04.680
And so in our programming,

456
00:29:04.681 --> 00:29:08.850
we're trying to incorporate means and levers to push back on this negative

457
00:29:08.851 --> 00:29:13.830
portrayal,
not only for the outsiders,
but also for community members themselves.

458
00:29:13.860 --> 00:29:18.180
So they really understand the assets that are there because only by building up

459
00:29:18.181 --> 00:29:21.660
that capacity and that power and that belief in these communities,

460
00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:25.650
will they be able to really take control of their own future and health.

461
00:29:25.710 --> 00:29:27.480
This ties back to what we said at the beginning,

462
00:29:27.690 --> 00:29:31.260
that most important principle that we do this kind of research.

463
00:29:31.261 --> 00:29:34.890
So it gives an authorship the ability of the community,

464
00:29:34.891 --> 00:29:39.891
be able to tell their own story and not having the media tell their story and to

465
00:29:39.901 --> 00:29:40.980
empower communities,

466
00:29:41.170 --> 00:29:46.170
they have real data and qualitatively and quantitatively to tell the story.

467
00:29:47.500 --> 00:29:51.810
Right.
So very true.
And I'll give one more example of kind of how,

468
00:29:51.860 --> 00:29:52.930
how we're doing that.

469
00:29:52.931 --> 00:29:56.950
So this is a slightly different story of North Lawndale and little village,

470
00:29:56.951 --> 00:30:00.640
which is also referred to a South Lawndale,
just not to confuse anyone.

471
00:30:01.540 --> 00:30:04.660
And these two communities are served by Mount Sinai hospital and they're ones

472
00:30:04.661 --> 00:30:08.410
directly north on Ogden avenue in one's directly south on Ogden Avenue.

473
00:30:08.411 --> 00:30:09.820
So right next to each other.

474
00:30:10.750 --> 00:30:14.240
They do look strikingly different demographically though.
Um,

475
00:30:14.270 --> 00:30:16.420
so north Lawndale is predominantly non Hispanic,

476
00:30:16.421 --> 00:30:20.620
black and little village is actually much denser population wise.

477
00:30:20.890 --> 00:30:23.890
And then also predominantly people of Mexican descent.

478
00:30:24.100 --> 00:30:26.290
It has a very large immigrant community.

479
00:30:26.980 --> 00:30:31.980
Now both of these communities do not fare well in terms of income and hence both

480
00:30:32.111 --> 00:30:35.920
do not fare well in terms of food insecurity.
So they're quite high levels.

481
00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:40.630
And so Mount Sinai doing a lot of work in the community may have the thought of,

482
00:30:40.840 --> 00:30:43.660
we could just do the same approach in both of these communities.

483
00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:48.460
And some of the things we heard at the forums would suggest that the pathways to

484
00:30:48.461 --> 00:30:51.520
food insecurity where the same before between these two communities.

485
00:30:51.520 --> 00:30:54.100
So minimum wage issues,

486
00:30:54.580 --> 00:30:58.130
lack of beneficial employment,
um,

487
00:30:58.210 --> 00:31:01.000
really expensive healthy food costs.

488
00:31:01.420 --> 00:31:04.030
But as we continued to discuss with community members,

489
00:31:04.031 --> 00:31:07.810
we really found the narratives and the pathways were quite different.

490
00:31:08.260 --> 00:31:12.730
And so in North Lawndale people talked about how it was a physical food desert.

491
00:31:12.731 --> 00:31:14.200
There were grocery stores,

492
00:31:14.470 --> 00:31:18.970
people had to go on two or three buses or get additional gas money to get to

493
00:31:18.971 --> 00:31:22.730
food.
And we actually,
after hearing this,
pulled up some numbers to,

494
00:31:22.840 --> 00:31:26.020
to go with these statements in it.
And it's true.

495
00:31:26.710 --> 00:31:30.550
And then in little village we found a little different story going on.

496
00:31:30.580 --> 00:31:32.770
So as I mentioned,
it was,

497
00:31:32.771 --> 00:31:37.120
it's a large immigrant community and what we heard overwhelmingly there was that

498
00:31:37.121 --> 00:31:41.170
there's resources here,
but a lot of people are fearful of accessing them,

499
00:31:41.440 --> 00:31:44.080
particularly in the current political environment.

500
00:31:44.380 --> 00:31:47.890
And so people were saying regardless of citizenship status,

501
00:31:48.430 --> 00:31:50.800
if a pantry was asking for an ID,

502
00:31:50.830 --> 00:31:54.640
they would not go there for fear of where their name would be listed going

503
00:31:54.641 --> 00:31:56.320
forward.
In addition,

504
00:31:56.321 --> 00:31:59.680
there was a lot of confusion about accessibility of food stamps.

505
00:32:00.310 --> 00:32:03.490
And this really helped us because we actually have some numbers from the survey

506
00:32:03.520 --> 00:32:07.450
on food stamps and on,
um,
emergency food access.

507
00:32:07.660 --> 00:32:11.800
And it really helped us see the why these inconsistencies and our numbers were

508
00:32:11.801 --> 00:32:16.330
happening.
And so this happened time and again that we heard different,

509
00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:20.560
we saw similar data but we heard different pathways at our community forums.

510
00:32:21.250 --> 00:32:21.910
Okay.

511
00:32:21.910 --> 00:32:26.910
So we've showed the story of some of our results and we want to get those

512
00:32:27.221 --> 00:32:31.090
results into the hands of different stakeholders,
policy makers,

513
00:32:31.091 --> 00:32:34.300
community members,
community organizations like Deborah's.

514
00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:38.410
And so we developed this really cool dissemination strategy that Pam's going to

515
00:32:38.411 --> 00:32:42.970
walk us through.
Um,
yes.
So to hit all of our different stakeholders,

516
00:32:43.250 --> 00:32:47.540
uh,
we first came out with a very large report on 16,

517
00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:49.100
16 different health topics.

518
00:32:49.160 --> 00:32:52.930
It was perfect for a media release and getting it out early to all the press,

519
00:32:52.940 --> 00:32:56.180
like very formal and professional.
You all would,

520
00:32:56.240 --> 00:33:00.740
as data minded people might find this the most interesting of the things that we

521
00:33:00.741 --> 00:33:05.480
released.
Um,
and then the second thing we did with go back to the community.

522
00:33:05.481 --> 00:33:09.810
So these were info graphics that had one piece of data on them.
Uh,

523
00:33:09.840 --> 00:33:13.580
and what they really tried to do was bring attention to a particular issue in

524
00:33:13.581 --> 00:33:14.840
the communities themselves.

525
00:33:14.870 --> 00:33:17.800
And our community advisory committee helped us decide which,

526
00:33:18.020 --> 00:33:22.750
what topics will be discussed.
And then lastly,
really for policymakers,

527
00:33:22.790 --> 00:33:25.250
Alderman funders,
people interested in the areas.

528
00:33:25.460 --> 00:33:27.620
We released these series of profiles.

529
00:33:27.770 --> 00:33:30.770
So all of this is available on our website along with videos.

530
00:33:30.771 --> 00:33:34.940
We didn't want to Belabor all 500 questions we asked here today.
Um,

531
00:33:35.030 --> 00:33:37.820
but you can find information on a lot of them on our website.

532
00:33:39.240 --> 00:33:39.930
<v 0>Great.</v>

533
00:33:39.930 --> 00:33:44.930
So this gets us to moving from usable information to actionable knowledge.

534
00:33:46.470 --> 00:33:51.470
So having a trusted a set of data and tools that can be leveraged to a support

535
00:33:53.161 --> 00:33:55.770
community efforts.
What are we going to do with it?
We heard some things,

536
00:33:55.950 --> 00:33:57.090
Debbie already shared with us,

537
00:33:57.091 --> 00:33:58.950
things that we're doing with Northland dope collaborative,

538
00:33:59.130 --> 00:34:02.190
but then we found a really cool thing that people want to do with it.

539
00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:07.400
Another initiative of Sinai health side of Sinai health system that Karen

540
00:34:08.880 --> 00:34:12.060
Teitelbaum initiated is the Chicago gun violence research collaborator.

541
00:34:12.360 --> 00:34:15.570
And Deborah and I had been very active in this collaborative and we did a lot of

542
00:34:15.571 --> 00:34:17.760
community listening sessions.
So what,

543
00:34:17.850 --> 00:34:21.870
how does the community want us to help them really address this problem of

544
00:34:21.871 --> 00:34:24.840
violence?
And here's one of the surprising things we heard.

545
00:34:25.050 --> 00:34:28.530
It was help our youth stay,

546
00:34:28.531 --> 00:34:32.760
help our youth get engaged and we want our youth to know that they can have

547
00:34:32.761 --> 00:34:37.350
research and data at their fingertips,
teach him to be research activist.

548
00:34:37.590 --> 00:34:41.250
And so one of the things you were going to be doing is bringing in a cohort of

549
00:34:41.251 --> 00:34:46.251
youth this summer and the learn things about advocacy and media and use of data

550
00:34:47.071 --> 00:34:50.050
and Info graphics and we'll begin to uh,

551
00:34:50.170 --> 00:34:54.870
build the next generation of Google researchers.
So for you go glare,
sewer,

552
00:34:54.871 --> 00:34:58.290
thinking about how could you use some of the things that we've shared,

553
00:34:58.410 --> 00:35:01.110
we say involve the communities,
particularly the youth.

554
00:35:01.230 --> 00:35:02.580
If you're not doing that already.

555
00:35:02.581 --> 00:35:07.080
And think about how you can enhance your own research and bringing new products

556
00:35:07.081 --> 00:35:10.050
to market by really this direct community involvement,

557
00:35:10.051 --> 00:35:14.700
particularly being attentive to some of the more disenfranchised communities.

558
00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:18.480
And then of course,
sign up for information and learn more about us.

559
00:35:19.680 --> 00:35:20.530
And,
uh,
Debra.

560
00:35:21.020 --> 00:35:24.940
<v 1>Yeah.
And I guess the last nugget I would recommend,
um,</v>

561
00:35:25.430 --> 00:35:29.690
as you go into the community,
always take a step back and say,

562
00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:34.820
whose Lens Am I?
Am I really seeing this information through?

563
00:35:35.090 --> 00:35:39.420
Because that's real important just to reflective of that.
Um,

564
00:35:39.450 --> 00:35:43.710
because we each bring our own experience to the table.

565
00:35:44.070 --> 00:35:48.540
And so we want to understand what experience we're bringing to the table and how

566
00:35:48.541 --> 00:35:53.400
we're interpreting that information because,
um,
the community is,

567
00:35:53.580 --> 00:35:57.570
you know,
very smart people and they've,
uh,

568
00:35:57.600 --> 00:36:01.230
we don't need to empower them because they are very much empowered these days.

569
00:36:01.500 --> 00:36:06.480
So when we want to do is work hand in hand with the community and just make sure

570
00:36:06.481 --> 00:36:11.481
that we understand the lens by which we're seeing them and they're seeing us so

571
00:36:12.690 --> 00:36:16.350
great.
So he got a perfect summary.
Forest,
Pam,
you know,
to us,

572
00:36:17.280 --> 00:36:21.090
<v 2>we're hoping to leave you today with the idea that place does matter,</v>

573
00:36:21.420 --> 00:36:25.890
that the methods we use to understand those places matter and that ultimately in

574
00:36:25.891 --> 00:36:30.660
the end,
our communities matter no matter where they're from,
who lives there.

575
00:36:30.870 --> 00:36:35.820
Um,
that we all have the right to justice and to health.
Thank you.

576
00:36:37.140 --> 00:36:42.140
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

577
00:36:42.990 --> 00:36:47.760
<v 2>as Google we have a lot of power to disseminate information.
Um,</v>

578
00:36:48.030 --> 00:36:51.630
what are some things that tech companies like us can do to help spread the word

579
00:36:54.090 --> 00:36:58.530
share with Nick's face?
Why don't you go ahead and go?
I know it's in a week

580
00:37:00.110 --> 00:37:02.360
<v 1>dreams.
So we'd done this sort of in three phases,</v>

581
00:37:02.361 --> 00:37:05.750
the traditional kind of research and then thinking about creative ways we could

582
00:37:05.751 --> 00:37:09.920
disseminate but about as creative as we got were things like these infographics.

583
00:37:09.921 --> 00:37:12.230
And then we've also created a little,

584
00:37:12.300 --> 00:37:15.670
a little podcast and Info live infographics,

585
00:37:15.830 --> 00:37:18.290
but we don't know how to get it to the next level.

586
00:37:18.380 --> 00:37:22.970
How to get it out and just be common parlance and people using it in the social

587
00:37:22.971 --> 00:37:26.150
media and thinking about these issues and discussing them.

588
00:37:26.151 --> 00:37:28.220
So how could you help us with that?

589
00:37:28.650 --> 00:37:30.700
<v 2>Yeah,
I mean,
I think the first thing is that we'll,</v>

590
00:37:30.710 --> 00:37:34.530
we'll post this talk on youtube and I encourage you all to share it and post it

591
00:37:34.531 --> 00:37:38.970
to your circles.
Um,
um,
yeah,

592
00:37:38.971 --> 00:37:41.820
but I think that's something that we as Google or should think about is that

593
00:37:41.821 --> 00:37:44.340
there's,
you know,
the people don't have resources,

594
00:37:44.341 --> 00:37:46.470
but also institutions like sign,

595
00:37:46.471 --> 00:37:49.680
I don't have resources like we have Google and how can we get their message out?

596
00:37:50.580 --> 00:37:54.150
<v 1>Yeah.
That's the only thing included along the lines of a drug abuse or opioids,</v>

597
00:37:54.151 --> 00:37:56.310
which is a very public thing right now.

598
00:37:56.320 --> 00:37:59.730
And did you look into that and research and factor in as well?

599
00:38:00.260 --> 00:38:02.420
<v 2>Yeah,
so we did.
So our first survey,</v>

600
00:38:02.421 --> 00:38:05.330
we actually didn't ask about drug use and substance use,

601
00:38:05.600 --> 00:38:10.250
but our community advisory committee insisted this time that we do.
Um,
they were,

602
00:38:10.340 --> 00:38:12.140
everyone was very insistent about it.

603
00:38:12.440 --> 00:38:17.270
So we did ask about them and about substance use and drug use.

604
00:38:17.840 --> 00:38:21.650
We have not released though that data just yet.

605
00:38:21.651 --> 00:38:24.950
We're in the process of putting it together because while we want to be

606
00:38:25.010 --> 00:38:26.120
responsible about it,

607
00:38:26.121 --> 00:38:29.780
we need to make sure we build a context around it so that we're not reinforcing

608
00:38:29.781 --> 00:38:33.440
a lot of stereotypes in our communities.
Um,
and for the groups that we serve.

609
00:38:33.650 --> 00:38:37.840
But yes,
we did ask about it,
even some of our colleagues.
So in addition,

610
00:38:38.200 --> 00:38:41.340
the other dissemination form is we're writing lots of papers in peer reviewed

611
00:38:41.341 --> 00:38:43.870
journals that I'm sure everyone in the world wants to read.
Um,

612
00:38:43.930 --> 00:38:46.560
but we are doing some research using some of that data.

613
00:38:46.670 --> 00:38:47.530
<v 0>Yeah,
I can leave.</v>

614
00:38:48.110 --> 00:38:51.830
We hope to get into the world of informing policy makers and have had some

615
00:38:52.100 --> 00:38:56.930
initial conversations with Kennedy Forum and others to think about ways that,

616
00:38:57.170 --> 00:39:00.440
that are so critical,
like understanding the opioid epidemic,

617
00:39:00.441 --> 00:39:05.441
what it means to our communities and begin to use our data to inform policy

618
00:39:06.081 --> 00:39:06.920
solutions.

619
00:39:07.420 --> 00:39:11.410
<v 4>I'm curious just to hear more about what the response has been from policy</v>

620
00:39:11.411 --> 00:39:14.200
makers and how,
how they're using the data.

621
00:39:14.230 --> 00:39:17.990
Are they denying it or are they excited about it?
Um,
and,

622
00:39:18.340 --> 00:39:22.270
and then my second question is there is already so many nonprofits and other

623
00:39:22.271 --> 00:39:25.990
organizations on the ground that are doing a lot of work and many of them

624
00:39:26.380 --> 00:39:29.200
measured their success in their own way.

625
00:39:29.590 --> 00:39:33.490
And so I'm curious how organizations that are already on the ground take

626
00:39:33.491 --> 00:39:37.650
information like this and do they embrace it or have you noticed that there are

627
00:39:37.680 --> 00:39:39.060
maybe a bit apprehensive to it?

628
00:39:39.530 --> 00:39:41.270
<v 2>So the policymaker piece,</v>

629
00:39:41.450 --> 00:39:43.760
I do an in Sharon or Deborah might be able to speak better.

630
00:39:43.761 --> 00:39:47.310
I has been very well received generally.

631
00:39:47.311 --> 00:39:49.580
I mean we have a couple of policymakers that we work with all the,

632
00:39:49.581 --> 00:39:54.581
all the time we have been trying to get more into the policy work and advocacy

633
00:39:55.100 --> 00:39:59.780
space.
Uh,
and that's a little bit slower.
It's not in our usual.

634
00:39:59.781 --> 00:40:02.720
We also are working with a couple of local organizations on that,

635
00:40:02.721 --> 00:40:07.100
so more to come on how that continues to move forward.
Um,

636
00:40:07.670 --> 00:40:11.180
and then the second piece is actually one of the things that Sinai does

637
00:40:11.181 --> 00:40:13.250
incredibly well.
Sci does well,

638
00:40:13.370 --> 00:40:17.630
Sui does well is we have really great partnerships with the community based

639
00:40:17.631 --> 00:40:19.520
organizations in the communities that we serve.

640
00:40:19.910 --> 00:40:22.490
And so they really enjoyed having this data.

641
00:40:22.520 --> 00:40:26.750
It's incredibly important for them to pursue funding to really highlight the

642
00:40:26.751 --> 00:40:28.550
needs in their areas.
Um,

643
00:40:28.570 --> 00:40:31.780
and oftentimes the numbers they're collecting are specific to their programs.

644
00:40:31.781 --> 00:40:36.380
So these provide much broader population level estimates that they really don't

645
00:40:36.381 --> 00:40:40.340
have the resources to get on their own in order to either say how things

646
00:40:40.341 --> 00:40:44.120
might've changed over time,
but also to pursue additional funding and say,

647
00:40:44.121 --> 00:40:46.370
you know,
we need more here to make more change.

648
00:40:47.010 --> 00:40:47.550
<v 4>Hey everyone,</v>

649
00:40:47.550 --> 00:40:51.600
I want to say thank you so much for the incredible work for someone who grew up

650
00:40:51.601 --> 00:40:53.910
in a little village.
It was interesting to see the numbers.

651
00:40:54.210 --> 00:40:57.510
I was really astonished at the similarities between North and south Lawndale.

652
00:40:57.990 --> 00:41:02.370
But then it's really interesting that taking the qualitative approach you took

653
00:41:02.700 --> 00:41:05.160
to inform the data driven results,
right.

654
00:41:05.161 --> 00:41:07.770
Help us get a better sense of understanding.

655
00:41:07.771 --> 00:41:10.210
Something that we constantly think about is,
you know,

656
00:41:10.230 --> 00:41:13.220
data scientists or analysts is that the numbers don't lie,

657
00:41:13.230 --> 00:41:16.680
but we do miss part of the story if we don't take that other approach.

658
00:41:16.681 --> 00:41:19.240
So I really appreciate that look because you know,

659
00:41:19.450 --> 00:41:20.700
there's growing up a little village,

660
00:41:20.701 --> 00:41:24.940
there's just stuff to buy it at every corner from every little place but and and

661
00:41:25.130 --> 00:41:27.640
across Hogben and it's a whole different story.
Um,

662
00:41:27.690 --> 00:41:31.560
but you have the same levels of insecurity,
which was really,
really astonishing.

663
00:41:31.980 --> 00:41:36.770
I just wanted to actually a couple of resources.
Uh,
the state,
uh,
Stacy,

664
00:41:36.771 --> 00:41:40.850
Linda over at University of Chicago did a similar project on resources in the

665
00:41:40.851 --> 00:41:44.540
neighborhood on women's health issues and was able to get a group of teens to,

666
00:41:44.660 --> 00:41:48.680
uh,
run a program called [inaudible] Corp and they actually did a great job.

667
00:41:50.800 --> 00:41:53.450
We're recruiting from them for that cohort next summer.

668
00:41:53.690 --> 00:41:56.960
They're going to be the second generation of interesting thing that happened

669
00:41:56.961 --> 00:42:01.730
there is Dave formed a better map of Woodlawn then we had at Google.

670
00:42:02.080 --> 00:42:05.140
Right.
Um,
by a large percentage.
Right.

671
00:42:05.210 --> 00:42:09.290
And that's where we fail and we kind of wake up luchadors to say we're missing

672
00:42:09.291 --> 00:42:10.820
some of these communities where,
you know,

673
00:42:10.900 --> 00:42:13.920
we might not spend enough time at are not everybody has access to phones and et

674
00:42:13.921 --> 00:42:17.630
Cetera.
So it helps us inform our tactics,
what we might be missing,

675
00:42:17.730 --> 00:42:20.990
missing things as well.
Uh,
and then the other one is for the pelvic Googlers.

676
00:42:20.991 --> 00:42:23.840
Here is any amount of time that we want to volunteer or spend.

677
00:42:23.850 --> 00:42:28.070
Don't forget to log your Google give ours because whether you spend an hour

678
00:42:28.080 --> 00:42:31.510
helping flush out a report or share data and social,
uh,

679
00:42:31.580 --> 00:42:35.390
social media or actually summer.
Yes.

680
00:42:35.630 --> 00:42:38.330
And we'd love to host them in the summer as well.
Uh,
we've,

681
00:42:38.331 --> 00:42:41.150
we've done that with different projects.
So,
uh,
thank you.

682
00:42:41.250 --> 00:42:44.520
<v 2>Definitely go online to see that and just no report,</v>

683
00:42:44.550 --> 00:42:45.900
especially growing up in little village,

684
00:42:45.930 --> 00:42:48.180
there is a lot more information available.

685
00:42:48.290 --> 00:42:49.270
<v 5>I just wanted to ask you to,</v>

686
00:42:49.271 --> 00:42:52.430
I haven't gone through the whole process and being able to see what comes out at

687
00:42:52.431 --> 00:42:56.120
the end.
If you could go back to the beginning and cheat,
you know,
what would you,

688
00:42:56.180 --> 00:42:59.990
what's one thing you think you could do differently to get a more fruitful

689
00:42:59.991 --> 00:43:00.824
outcome there?

690
00:43:01.420 --> 00:43:06.280
<v 2>Ultimately we did run into some recruitment issues and so I am not an expert in</v>

691
00:43:06.281 --> 00:43:10.750
survey design or recruitment really,
but I do know several of my colleagues,
um,

692
00:43:10.840 --> 00:43:14.290
just little tweaks we could have made a little bit earlier on in terms of

693
00:43:14.410 --> 00:43:18.970
getting our numbers up even higher than they were,
um,
I think would have been a,

694
00:43:19.710 --> 00:43:21.220
a key elegant pieces.

695
00:43:21.221 --> 00:43:25.710
I think we use traditional sample survey methods when we worked with you.
I see.

696
00:43:25.870 --> 00:43:30.580
And that the unit,
the,
the household was the,
the sampling unit and I don't,

697
00:43:30.850 --> 00:43:34.110
and this,
and it made it really difficult in some of the gated communities is it

698
00:43:34.120 --> 00:43:36.400
particularly,
uh,
men or control communities?

699
00:43:36.640 --> 00:43:40.990
But I don't think that the household is the best sampling unit.

700
00:43:40.991 --> 00:43:43.720
And I think we'd want to think differently about that.

701
00:43:44.440 --> 00:43:46.270
It's the whole of the balancing of all that,
you know,

702
00:43:46.271 --> 00:43:48.850
the positive and negatives of each of each of the approaches.

703
00:43:48.851 --> 00:43:51.940
I just some combination of those issues.

704
00:43:51.941 --> 00:43:55.180
So I think we were really proud and happy with our community engagement,

705
00:43:55.181 --> 00:43:58.560
but it was,
it's more of those technical issues that,
you know,

706
00:43:58.570 --> 00:44:00.160
everyone who does a survey has,
so,

707
00:44:00.680 --> 00:44:04.490
<v 1>and I might be off base,
but what I was hearing,</v>

708
00:44:04.491 --> 00:44:07.520
particularly with the gun violence collaborative piece of it,

709
00:44:07.521 --> 00:44:09.380
when he did the listening tours,

710
00:44:09.770 --> 00:44:13.430
more and more communities want to B to B.

711
00:44:13.490 --> 00:44:15.740
They want to be a part of the research.

712
00:44:16.070 --> 00:44:19.790
So it's not where they want outsiders coming in it.

713
00:44:19.791 --> 00:44:21.320
There's the whole trust factor.

714
00:44:21.830 --> 00:44:25.460
And so if we could be do what we're planning to do,

715
00:44:25.461 --> 00:44:30.170
which is to train more individuals from the community to be able to do their own

716
00:44:30.171 --> 00:44:32.430
research,
then I think it,

717
00:44:32.520 --> 00:44:35.650
I think that'll just change the,
the,

718
00:44:35.651 --> 00:44:39.600
the narrative on that because I think that's where some of the,

719
00:44:39.990 --> 00:44:44.430
cause I know there was a point in north Lawndale where the numbers weren't going

720
00:44:44.431 --> 00:44:49.170
where it needed to be here with 10 callbacks.
We were struggling,
struggling.

721
00:44:49.171 --> 00:44:51.150
And I think part of it was,
is that folks,

722
00:44:51.151 --> 00:44:56.151
like I am tired of folks coming in here asking me information and,

723
00:44:56.560 --> 00:45:01.230
and not giving anything back.
No more.
And so we have,

724
00:45:01.231 --> 00:45:05.570
you know,
that was what I was hearing and I'm not a researcher.
And so I,

725
00:45:05.640 --> 00:45:08.730
the good thing is that under Sharon's leadership,

726
00:45:09.390 --> 00:45:12.690
folks listening and honoring what the community's saying.

727
00:45:13.510 --> 00:45:17.740
<v 3>Okay,
well thank you so much to our friends from Sinai Health Institute and Sinai</v>

728
00:45:17.741 --> 00:45:22.500
health system,
my birthday now you'll pay

729
00:45:25.200 --> 00:45:27.040
everyone for coming.
Thank you.
