00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:09.070
Hi everyone.
Um,

2
00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:13.120
I'm Rachel and welcome to the latest installation of talks at Google.

3
00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:17.830
I'm happy to announce my personal friend and colleague,
Peter Benjamin.

4
00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:20.260
I met Peter about four years ago.

5
00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:24.070
He was recommended to me by someone who's built an acrobat and a Thai massage

6
00:00:24.071 --> 00:00:26.560
practitioner.
And her words were,

7
00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:30.670
if you're serious about fixing that hamstring,
here's the person to go to.

8
00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:35.560
And I looked up this guy,
Peter Benjamin,
two first names,
what's up,
right?

9
00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:38.230
He was a long way away from me.

10
00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:42.850
It took me about an hour of taking a really inconvenient and bus and then walk

11
00:00:42.851 --> 00:00:46.660
in halfway across Watertown to get to see this crazy person.
And I was like,

12
00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:49.690
this person better be a wizard or else I have never taken this trip again.

13
00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:53.380
And one hour later I said,
I'll be back next Tuesday.

14
00:00:53.381 --> 00:00:55.240
And the one after that and the one after that,

15
00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:58.960
because he had not only figured out what was wrong with my hamstring,

16
00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:03.820
but the reason why I kept injuring it over and over again.
No,

17
00:01:03.821 --> 00:01:05.770
I have my rights.
Let's again.
So thank you Peter,

18
00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.050
and I am very pleased to welcome you to Google.

19
00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:10.860
<v 1>[inaudible].</v>

20
00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:14.370
<v 0>Thank you Rachel and thank you for bringing me here.</v>

21
00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.510
So I want to,
there's a lot that I want to get to today.

22
00:01:18.511 --> 00:01:20.790
Talk a little bit about injuries,

23
00:01:20.791 --> 00:01:24.700
pain healing and some of the things that get in the way of that.
Um,

24
00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:25.681
but before I do that,

25
00:01:25.681 --> 00:01:29.610
I'm just going to tell you a little bit about me and how I got to where I am.

26
00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.120
And to do that,
we need to go back a generation.
So,
um,

27
00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.890
when my father was 13 years old,

28
00:01:34.891 --> 00:01:39.891
he was training to be a professional dancer and he got a serious low back injury

29
00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:41.460
and um,

30
00:01:41.461 --> 00:01:46.461
his mother took him to the physician and they recommended surgery and she said,

31
00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.440
what's wrong with him?
And they said,
well,
we don't know,

32
00:01:49.441 --> 00:01:52.830
but we'll figure it out once we get in there.
Uh,
needless to say,

33
00:01:52.831 --> 00:01:54.720
they did not go through with the surgery,

34
00:01:55.410 --> 00:02:00.410
but that started him out on a lifelong journey of treating and learning about

35
00:02:00.541 --> 00:02:01.560
and treating injuries.

36
00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.740
And he went on to get a phd in sports medicine when I was 13 years old.

37
00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:08.910
I loved playing soccer.

38
00:02:08.911 --> 00:02:13.911
It was a super intense soccer player and I got a really serious low back injury

39
00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.280
and also ankle injuries and neck injury.

40
00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.260
And that was the genesis of my fascination with this work.

41
00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.790
And so I began getting interested in exercise and then nutrition.

42
00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.660
And when I was 19 I asked my dad what was that injury stuff that he did?

43
00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.070
And I was just hooked once I got in.

44
00:02:38.071 --> 00:02:43.071
And I've spent the last 10 years of my life completely focused on learning about

45
00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:46.980
how to deal with injuries and pain.
And I've learned,

46
00:02:46.981 --> 00:02:50.730
I had the opportunity to really learn through the old world schooling of

47
00:02:50.731 --> 00:02:54.600
apprenticeship through my father and through some other amazing people in my

48
00:02:54.601 --> 00:02:58.870
field.
And that's really allowed me to move,
you know,

49
00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:02.710
so far through getting this,
these amazing opportunities for apprenticeship.

50
00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:08.710
So who here has had some injury or pain in the last year?

51
00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:13.180
Wow,
okay.
I think that's just about everyone.
Yeah.

52
00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:17.380
So yeah.

53
00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:23.890
So first of all,
let's define some terms.
So what's an injury?

54
00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:25.391
An injury.

55
00:03:25.391 --> 00:03:29.980
I had defined it very simply as damaged tissue that's causing pain.

56
00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:35.770
So let's talk a little bit about that.
So what gets injured?
Well,

57
00:03:35.771 --> 00:03:38.770
there's lots of different things that get injured and we're going to focus today

58
00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:43.900
mostly on ligaments,
tendons,
and muscles,
a little bit on joints.

59
00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:47.860
And so just to define those terms,

60
00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:51.850
ligaments are,
it's very strong fibers,

61
00:03:51.851 --> 00:03:54.940
tissue that holds your bones together.
So you've got them in your ankles,

62
00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.430
you've got them,
a lots of them in your low back,

63
00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:00.370
all the way up your spine and your neck,
anywhere where two bones meet.

64
00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:04.810
So if you go out and reach around to your back and just sort of strum along any

65
00:04:04.811 --> 00:04:05.980
of these spa,

66
00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:09.910
these spines that these are called spinus processes,

67
00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:12.220
then you'll be able to sort of pluck across and field,

68
00:04:12.221 --> 00:04:15.010
those are ligaments that you've got them all over your body.

69
00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:20.850
And if you bend your elbow and you sort of pluck,
there's going to be a,

70
00:04:20.851 --> 00:04:25.600
a,
a sort of stringy fiber there.
That's your bicep tendon,
right?

71
00:04:25.601 --> 00:04:28.330
So tendons hold muscles to bones,

72
00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:32.800
but you've also got one behind your knee,
right?
If you pull your heel,

73
00:04:32.801 --> 00:04:34.690
turn your body,
you can feel them stick out.

74
00:04:34.691 --> 00:04:39.691
So tendons and ligaments tend to sustain injury for a lot longer than muscles

75
00:04:41.261 --> 00:04:43.540
because they have less blood flow to them.

76
00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:47.070
So that's,
that's,

77
00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:50.470
those are the different types of structures that we'll talk about that get

78
00:04:50.471 --> 00:04:55.150
injuries and they cause a lot of different pain and problems.
So let's,

79
00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:57.460
let's call this a ligament or a tendon.

80
00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:01.030
So there's a couple of qualities about this that I want you to keep in mind.

81
00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:05.860
Really important.
So first is their longitudinal,
right?

82
00:05:05.861 --> 00:05:09.280
So these are actually lollipop sticks,
but there's,

83
00:05:09.281 --> 00:05:10.450
and there's about a hundred of them.

84
00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:14.230
So all these fibers are longitudinal that makes them,

85
00:05:14.231 --> 00:05:18.820
it's very important because it makes them extremely powerful when we do have a

86
00:05:18.821 --> 00:05:21.220
demand on them,
it's very,
very strong.

87
00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:26.200
Second Quality I want you to keep in mind is,
is mobile,
right?

88
00:05:26.201 --> 00:05:30.220
They move against each other.
So we're not weird dynamic human beings.

89
00:05:30.221 --> 00:05:35.200
We move in lots of different ways and so that demand is going to change and

90
00:05:35.201 --> 00:05:39.610
shift the demand on the ligament or the tendon.
So,

91
00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:43.580
and let's,
we're going to say that this is so in any given ligament or tendon,

92
00:05:43.581 --> 00:05:46.390
and it could have,
let's say a million fibers,
right?

93
00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:50.740
So let's say you get an injury.
What's an injury?
Damage.
Tissue,
right?

94
00:05:50.741 --> 00:05:53.380
Damage tissue that causes pain.
So you get an injury.

95
00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:57.560
Some of the fibers get torn.
Now in this case,

96
00:05:57.561 --> 00:06:02.510
in most cases it's just a few hundred or maybe a thousand fibers out of a

97
00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:05.000
million.
It's not,
we're not talking torn in half,
right?

98
00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:07.430
Injuries happen all the time.
In fact,

99
00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:09.860
there's normal and natural and also heal all the time.

100
00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:14.210
So let's talk about what happens when it doesn't feel so great.

101
00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:19.510
So you get that terror and the body seeks to be connected to itself always.

102
00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:24.740
So there's a brick as just like if any of you were like,
oh my God,
I broken,

103
00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:29.300
my access to the Internet is like broken.
I like someone,
please pass this up.

104
00:06:29.301 --> 00:06:32.570
Someone please fix this.
The body does the same thing.

105
00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:35.000
So it sends,
it,

106
00:06:35.001 --> 00:06:38.000
sends the immune system and in the immune system goes in and it lays down

107
00:06:38.001 --> 00:06:41.960
something called scar tissue.
Now,
you may have heard different names for this.
Um,

108
00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:44.780
scar tissue adhesions,
adhesive scar tissue,

109
00:06:44.781 --> 00:06:48.860
there's a lot of different names for it and scar tissue goes down and it seeks

110
00:06:48.861 --> 00:06:53.780
to patch it up.
Now it's a lot.
So lizards,

111
00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:54.141
right?

112
00:06:54.141 --> 00:06:58.910
They like grow back tales were much more like the duck tape and glue system.

113
00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:02.710
Like we're much more like as good enough.
Uh,

114
00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:05.990
and so scar tissue is much more like glue.
It's very sticky.

115
00:07:05.991 --> 00:07:09.440
And if you look at it microscopically,
it actually looks like spiderwebs.

116
00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:14.900
And so if you get a tear,
small tear,
micro tear,

117
00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:19.190
all of a sudden those little spider webs get laid down,
thousands of them.

118
00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:23.780
So what's happened to our two qualities that we,
that I spoke about earlier,

119
00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:29.450
they've been compromised,
right?
So all of a sudden they're not all longitudinal.

120
00:07:29.451 --> 00:07:34.370
They're going every which way.
And now that whole area is stuck together.

121
00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:39.740
So now we're,
we're set up to be in a cycle of chronic pain.

122
00:07:39.741 --> 00:07:43.240
So with soft tissue injuries,
the,

123
00:07:43.690 --> 00:07:47.870
the tendency is you get a little bit better and then a little bit worse and then

124
00:07:47.871 --> 00:07:49.460
better.
And then worse than than much worse.

125
00:07:49.461 --> 00:07:51.800
And then a little bit better than a lot better.
And then worse,

126
00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:54.620
that's the cycle of the soft tissue injuries,
right?

127
00:07:54.621 --> 00:07:57.320
So what's happening is you lay down the scar tissue,

128
00:07:57.620 --> 00:08:01.250
then you do a little bit too much.
It breaks again,
more scar tissue goes down,

129
00:08:01.251 --> 00:08:05.120
more pain than it starts to get a little bit better.

130
00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:09.170
Then you tear it again and you're in that chronic cycle.
So

131
00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:11.840
what do you do about that?

132
00:08:12.770 --> 00:08:16.790
Now there's a lot of different ways to address scar tissue.

133
00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:20.420
What are the ways that I use is I go in and then you have to be able to find it.

134
00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:21.823
Um,

135
00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:26.860
but I go in and use manual techniques to simply go ahead and break up that scar

136
00:08:27.261 --> 00:08:31.850
tissue.
So going in and introducing manual movement to break up that scar tissue.

137
00:08:32.030 --> 00:08:36.560
I also use a machine.
There's some people use special tools or other machines.

138
00:08:36.561 --> 00:08:39.650
There's lots of ways.
And however,

139
00:08:40.970 --> 00:08:43.610
two minutes after someone walks out the door of my office,

140
00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:47.420
that scar tissue is going to lay down again.
It's going to start laying down,

141
00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:52.880
but it's new scar tissue.
And we have a new opportunity,
right?

142
00:08:52.881 --> 00:08:56.880
So scar tissue actually remodels,
right?

143
00:08:56.970 --> 00:08:59.430
It learns.
So if just as,

144
00:08:59.431 --> 00:09:04.431
if you were to have a bonsai tree and you wanted to mold that bonsai tree into a

145
00:09:04.561 --> 00:09:09.230
specific shape,
what would you do?
You wouldn't just push on at one time.
No.

146
00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:11.430
Would you sort of tap it whenever you thought about it?

147
00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:13.200
Now you'd build a structure,
right?

148
00:09:13.201 --> 00:09:16.830
You to build a structure to show it the shape that you wanted it to grow in.

149
00:09:18.030 --> 00:09:23.030
So exercise movement is needed for ligaments,

150
00:09:23.311 --> 00:09:24.480
tendons and muscles.

151
00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:29.250
Movement is hugely important to teach that new scar tissue that's laying down

152
00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:30.630
how you want it to form.

153
00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:35.190
So most recent studies say that scar tissue can remodel for up to nine months.

154
00:09:35.430 --> 00:09:39.660
Now it happens more intensively for quite a few weeks directly after an injury.

155
00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:44.070
So,
um,
have with rehabilitative movement,

156
00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:48.810
we want it to be specific,
targeted and measurable.

157
00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:54.570
So if you go in and you do way too much,
you're going to get more tearing.

158
00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:59.190
If you do way too little,
it's not going to get the information that it needs,

159
00:09:59.191 --> 00:10:01.830
right?
So the language of the body is movement,

160
00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:06.120
specifically tension and lack of tension.

161
00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:10.590
So if you don't,
if you're having too much tension,

162
00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:12.390
you're going to have returning.
If you don't have enough,

163
00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:16.290
it's not getting the information that needs.
Does that make sense?
Cool.

164
00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:22.760
So there's a lot of,
oh yeah.

165
00:10:22.761 --> 00:10:26.400
And so over time it's going to regrow and his gain back then integrity.

166
00:10:26.970 --> 00:10:31.350
Now there's a lot of things that tend to cause a lot of confusion around

167
00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:35.970
identifying causes of pain.
So let's talk a little bit about that.

168
00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:40.380
So there's the direct cause of pain,
which we've talked about,

169
00:10:40.381 --> 00:10:44.160
which is going to mean damaged tissue,
inflammation,
swelling.

170
00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:47.220
All those problems are over here now.

171
00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:52.640
Then there's the indirect causes and there's infinite number of indirect causes.

172
00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:56.970
We'll talk about a few of them.
So one of them is posture,
right?

173
00:10:56.971 --> 00:11:00.690
So posture is how you're holding yourself,
right?

174
00:11:00.691 --> 00:11:04.770
So if if I,
next time you guys get up and walk around,
you can try this.

175
00:11:04.771 --> 00:11:08.520
If I drop my right ankle and down towards the ground,

176
00:11:08.521 --> 00:11:12.180
all of a sudden I can already feel pressure on the inside of my knee.

177
00:11:12.350 --> 00:11:16.050
And the inside of my ankle on the outside of my hip.
So for me,

178
00:11:16.051 --> 00:11:17.790
if I were to walk like this for five minutes,

179
00:11:17.791 --> 00:11:21.630
I might be pretty uncomfortable for other people.
They walk around this way,

180
00:11:21.631 --> 00:11:25.560
their whole life never had a pain in their life.
So it's depends.

181
00:11:25.650 --> 00:11:29.640
It's really gonna depend on what,
who is doing it,
right?

182
00:11:29.641 --> 00:11:33.810
So it's indirect.
So that posture and movement patterns,
right?
So again,
Rsi.

183
00:11:33.811 --> 00:11:38.190
So if I take two of you and put you on the computer for the same amount of time

184
00:11:38.191 --> 00:11:39.690
each day for a certain period of time,

185
00:11:39.990 --> 00:11:44.100
one of you might get repetitive strain injury and the other might not.
Right?

186
00:11:44.101 --> 00:11:48.840
So it's indirect.
It can contribute to an eventual damage of tissue,

187
00:11:49.170 --> 00:11:53.650
but it's not necessarily going to contribute to it.
Another one is nutrition,

188
00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:57.670
right?
So our bodies are made of materials,
right?

189
00:11:57.671 --> 00:12:02.530
So the quality of materials that we give it to rebuild has an impact on the

190
00:12:02.531 --> 00:12:06.880
integrity of those tissues.
So if you have low quality ingredients,

191
00:12:07.450 --> 00:12:12.310
more likely to get an injury,
it's indirect.
Some people eat terribly,
they don't,

192
00:12:12.340 --> 00:12:17.140
they don't eat in a very healthy way.
Never have,
hardly ever have pain.
Right?

193
00:12:17.141 --> 00:12:20.170
And other people it really well and they have a lot of pain.
So again,

194
00:12:20.171 --> 00:12:24.790
it's indirect.
So that makes sense.

195
00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:28.300
Great.
So there's another thing,

196
00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:32.770
there's another thing that can cause pain.
It's not necessarily an indirect cost,

197
00:12:32.771 --> 00:12:36.790
which is disease.
And so this is why I always,
always,

198
00:12:36.791 --> 00:12:39.820
always send people to go see a doctor.

199
00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:43.150
Now some people would totally find going to seeing a doctor,

200
00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:48.160
other people there since for different reasons they might be resistant.

201
00:12:48.221 --> 00:12:51.640
So I want to make the case for you that if you have something going on,

202
00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.330
even if you think it's relatively mundane,
if it's new,

203
00:12:56.500 --> 00:13:01.180
great idea to go get it checked out by a doctor.
Give you a few examples.

204
00:13:01.270 --> 00:13:06.270
So I have a friend who knows someone who got a terrible headache,

205
00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:10.620
went to the er,
um,

206
00:13:10.780 --> 00:13:15.070
got triaged and put in the waiting room and we're sitting in the waiting room

207
00:13:15.071 --> 00:13:18.430
and five hours later he died.
He had a brain hemorrhage.

208
00:13:19.830 --> 00:13:20.530
Um,

209
00:13:20.530 --> 00:13:25.270
another example is if you have pain when you were raising your arm

210
00:13:26.950 --> 00:13:29.890
in your shoulder,
that could be a lot of different things.

211
00:13:29.891 --> 00:13:32.890
It can also be lung cancer can also be lung cancer.

212
00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:38.530
And I'll leave you with one more if you have pain in both of your heels at the

213
00:13:38.531 --> 00:13:41.260
same time.
Now it could be a lot of things.

214
00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:44.470
It could be Achilles tendonitis,

215
00:13:44.620 --> 00:13:48.910
it could be plantar fasciitis,
it's also a symptom of gonorrhea.

216
00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:51.250
So it's always,
always,

217
00:13:51.251 --> 00:13:55.090
always a good idea to go get these things checked out by a doctor because

218
00:13:55.091 --> 00:13:58.240
there's lots of things that you or I would never know about that you can get

219
00:13:58.241 --> 00:14:00.250
cleared by going to a doctor.

220
00:14:03.010 --> 00:14:07.450
So let's talk about another thing that really trips people up and that's

221
00:14:07.451 --> 00:14:12.451
referred pain to referred pain is when you have damaged tissue in one location

222
00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.090
and pain and another.
So this,

223
00:14:16.210 --> 00:14:20.190
this happens mostly in the trunk,
right?
So if,

224
00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:23.530
if I have pain in the ligaments of my low back,

225
00:14:23.531 --> 00:14:27.550
so we talked about the ligaments,
right?
They connect bones together.

226
00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:29.920
So you'll see there's lots of bones here in the low back.

227
00:14:30.730 --> 00:14:32.590
And so there's lots of ligaments,

228
00:14:32.620 --> 00:14:37.620
no ligaments here in the low back can send a pain down the whole leg into the

229
00:14:38.591 --> 00:14:40.900
foot or even just partially down into the leg.

230
00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:42.850
You can send it into the outside of the hip,

231
00:14:43.030 --> 00:14:44.290
make you think you have a hip injury.

232
00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:47.950
You can send it into the inner thigh or the Groin area.

233
00:14:48.940 --> 00:14:52.820
So that's a lot of different places.
Another one is the shoulder,

234
00:14:52.850 --> 00:14:57.850
so shoulder and the shoulder you have quite a few different muscles and tendon

235
00:14:57.921 --> 00:15:01.610
attachment.
So the rotator cuff is,
um,

236
00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:05.060
is actually four different tendons attaching on the head of the Humerus,

237
00:15:05.061 --> 00:15:09.710
which is this upper arm bone here.
And um,
it can,
those,

238
00:15:09.711 --> 00:15:13.820
any injuries to any of those tendons can actually send a pain into this part of

239
00:15:13.821 --> 00:15:14.331
the arm here,

240
00:15:14.331 --> 00:15:19.331
which is on the muscle called the deltoid or even all the way down to the wrist

241
00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.760
in the shoulder.
It won't refer any farther than the rest.

242
00:15:23.420 --> 00:15:25.760
So as you can imagine,

243
00:15:26.210 --> 00:15:28.730
if you've got a pain into your deltoid here,

244
00:15:29.020 --> 00:15:34.020
a lot of practitioners will go in and mash on the deltoids for a long time

245
00:15:34.041 --> 00:15:35.210
trying to treat the injury.

246
00:15:35.750 --> 00:15:40.750
Now I've treated thousands of people and in my career I've only seen three

247
00:15:43.401 --> 00:15:48.401
deltoid injuries and all three of them were either circus acrobats or acrobatic

248
00:15:49.701 --> 00:15:52.190
dancers who were holding a person on their arm.

249
00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:57.950
The deltoid is a wonderfully efficient,
is a wonderfully efficient muscle.

250
00:15:57.950 --> 00:16:02.150
It hardly ever gets injured.
The rotator cuff muscles,
four of them,

251
00:16:02.510 --> 00:16:04.910
on the other hand,
they're weak,
they're stabilizers.

252
00:16:04.911 --> 00:16:08.870
Often they get over a tax and they get injured pretty easily and it really

253
00:16:08.871 --> 00:16:13.270
confuses people.
So another one,
uh,

254
00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:17.180
that's a really big deal is the neck.

255
00:16:17.930 --> 00:16:21.980
Now injuries to the front on the ligaments on the front of the neck.
So,

256
00:16:21.981 --> 00:16:25.760
and also a lot of people think if I have referred pain,
I have a nervous issue.

257
00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:30.890
That's sometimes true.
But ligaments and tendons can also refer pain.

258
00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:32.840
It's common misconception.

259
00:16:34.130 --> 00:16:38.150
So if I have injuries to the front of my neck here,

260
00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:41.510
that can send a pain to the front of the chest,

261
00:16:41.511 --> 00:16:42.800
which is pretty uncommon actually.

262
00:16:43.190 --> 00:16:47.960
But what's not uncommon is injuries to the ligaments and the lower back portion,

263
00:16:48.290 --> 00:16:51.650
which gives you a pain right in here,

264
00:16:52.850 --> 00:16:55.580
who here has had a pain in between their shoulder blades.

265
00:16:57.170 --> 00:16:58.850
It's a pretty common pain.

266
00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:04.910
And so I see a lot of people going in and getting different kinds of treatments

267
00:17:05.030 --> 00:17:07.580
in between their spine and their shoulder blade.
Right?

268
00:17:07.820 --> 00:17:11.750
And often it helps for an hour or two or maybe even a week,

269
00:17:11.930 --> 00:17:12.950
but then it comes back.

270
00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:18.700
So the reason for that is that they're not actually getting at the actual damage

271
00:17:18.801 --> 00:17:21.680
site.
Right?
So that pain is actually coming from a different location.

272
00:17:22.220 --> 00:17:23.890
So when the pain goes there,

273
00:17:23.891 --> 00:17:27.680
the muscles tighten up and it feels good to get massage or whatever it is,

274
00:17:28.070 --> 00:17:31.640
but it's often,
often,
often going to come back.

275
00:17:33.170 --> 00:17:34.003
Does that make sense?

276
00:17:35.630 --> 00:17:39.590
And the last one is,
uh,

277
00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:42.230
well actually let's go a few more.
So knowing,

278
00:17:42.231 --> 00:17:47.030
being able to find where the damage scar tissue is is hugely important.
Right?

279
00:17:47.330 --> 00:17:52.110
So in the rotator cuff,
you've got four muscles for 10 and attachments.

280
00:17:52.350 --> 00:17:55.890
Now,
um,
people say,
you know,
people come in and sometimes say,
well,

281
00:17:55.891 --> 00:17:58.170
I've have a rotator cuff and tree.
Well,

282
00:17:59.310 --> 00:18:02.640
they probably did it went to someone who doesn't quite know what they have,

283
00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:05.310
right?
Because they might have a rotator cuff injury,

284
00:18:05.311 --> 00:18:06.870
but they might have something different.

285
00:18:06.871 --> 00:18:08.910
And if they do have a rotating harder at cuff injury,

286
00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:12.180
each one of those tendons does a different thing.
Is treated differently,

287
00:18:12.930 --> 00:18:17.280
is rehab differently.
So I'll give you an example.

288
00:18:17.610 --> 00:18:19.500
You've got,
um,
can I borrow you?

289
00:18:21.540 --> 00:18:26.100
So you have a muscle called the superspinatus know it pushes the arm away from

290
00:18:26.101 --> 00:18:29.940
the body like this,
but not very far.
The deltoids takeover about here.

291
00:18:30.990 --> 00:18:35.190
So it runs along the shoulder here and then dives under this bone here,

292
00:18:35.191 --> 00:18:37.980
which is called your acromion and then attaches up onto the humerus,

293
00:18:37.981 --> 00:18:42.950
which is this upper arm bone.
Now it's under the bone.
This is a very commonly,

294
00:18:43.110 --> 00:18:47.640
uh,
injured tendon.
Now if I'm trying to work on her like this,

295
00:18:47.641 --> 00:18:49.470
I'm never going to impact it.
Right?

296
00:18:49.471 --> 00:18:54.090
So having the knowledge of being able to access it is hugely important.

297
00:18:54.091 --> 00:18:56.250
So for this one,
it's right under the bone here.

298
00:18:56.251 --> 00:18:57.960
I'd have to take the bone off to touch it,

299
00:18:58.350 --> 00:19:02.490
but if I rotate her arm and put it behind her,

300
00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:07.620
it rolls to the front and then I can find it and I can pop in it,

301
00:19:07.621 --> 00:19:11.340
which basically means touch
and,

302
00:19:11.790 --> 00:19:14.790
and so and then I'm able to treat it.
Does that make sense?

303
00:19:15.470 --> 00:19:16.303
<v 1>Thank you.</v>

304
00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:21.313
So

305
00:19:23.490 --> 00:19:27.000
<v 0>injuries to the neck can do another thing,</v>

306
00:19:27.001 --> 00:19:30.510
which is that they can actually send a pain on the upper portion.

307
00:19:30.511 --> 00:19:34.530
They can send a pain up into the head and that can,

308
00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:35.910
you can have head pain.

309
00:19:36.420 --> 00:19:39.600
And this is another thing that really confuses people is headaches.

310
00:19:39.750 --> 00:19:43.230
So you can have head pain,
but you can also have um,

311
00:19:43.590 --> 00:19:46.680
a neck injury that's referring pet pain into the head.

312
00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:49.140
And then it can trigger a headache or a Migraine,

313
00:19:49.141 --> 00:19:54.120
which is another thing that I do a lot of work with.
All right.

314
00:19:54.540 --> 00:19:57.630
So we've talked about scar tissue,

315
00:19:58.050 --> 00:20:01.470
we've talked about injuries,
we've talked about referred pain,

316
00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:03.520
direct and indirect causes a pain,

317
00:20:03.810 --> 00:20:06.570
we'll take a few minutes to take a few questions.

318
00:20:07.650 --> 00:20:12.270
<v 2>So I pretty much budget to do physical therapy once a year for like kind of a</v>

319
00:20:12.271 --> 00:20:16.610
rotating cast of injuries
and um,

320
00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:18.480
and so,
um,

321
00:20:18.510 --> 00:20:23.510
one that often comes into play is like I have recurring like bicep tendinitis

322
00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:28.530
and it gets worse sometimes and then ice gets better.

323
00:20:28.531 --> 00:20:31.570
And I've been told that it's just like everything swells up and gets angry in

324
00:20:31.580 --> 00:20:33.360
green.
That's why it doesn't get better.

325
00:20:33.361 --> 00:20:36.330
So can you talk about the interaction between,
um,

326
00:20:37.080 --> 00:20:39.750
angry tendons and um,

327
00:20:39.900 --> 00:20:43.200
swelling and other types of badness that would cause it to stay bad?

328
00:20:43.750 --> 00:20:46.960
<v 0>Totally.
Yeah.
So again,</v>

329
00:20:47.530 --> 00:20:52.360
when you have a tendon that is,
this actually comes back to some of,

330
00:20:52.450 --> 00:20:56.470
I think someone over here had the question.
Um,
so if,

331
00:20:56.920 --> 00:21:01.480
if you get an injury to the tendon,
then you're going to have,
uh,
you would,

332
00:21:01.481 --> 00:21:05.110
that means is you've got a tear somewhere.
Not,
not huge,
not in half,

333
00:21:05.140 --> 00:21:09.460
but micro tear.
And if you,
let's say you goose,

334
00:21:09.490 --> 00:21:13.990
do some physical therapy,
um,
you can remodel some of that scar tissue,

335
00:21:14.140 --> 00:21:14.680
but if it,

336
00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:18.100
if you don't build the strength back up in the integrity of that structure,

337
00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:20.050
backup to what it was before,

338
00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:23.650
then what's going to happen is if you do a little too,

339
00:21:23.660 --> 00:21:26.110
too much at the wrong angle a little bit later,

340
00:21:26.380 --> 00:21:27.760
that scar tissue is going to tear again.

341
00:21:28.210 --> 00:21:30.940
And when you've got the tearing with WWE,
even in tendons and ligaments,

342
00:21:30.941 --> 00:21:31.491
when you get 10,

343
00:21:31.491 --> 00:21:35.740
you get a little bit of blood that comes out and then you'll get the swelling

344
00:21:35.741 --> 00:21:39.670
and the inflammation.
And depending on,
um,
the state,

345
00:21:39.700 --> 00:21:41.020
we'll talk about this a little bit more later.

346
00:21:41.021 --> 00:21:42.670
The state of your immune system and function,

347
00:21:42.671 --> 00:21:45.800
you're going to have more swelling or more inflammation or less.

348
00:21:46.630 --> 00:21:51.630
But often it's that cycle of this scar tissue not completely returning to its

349
00:21:52.091 --> 00:21:56.350
original integrity.
You can,
you get about 80% integrity with injuries.

350
00:21:56.490 --> 00:21:59.590
We've militating them.
Does that answer your question?

351
00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:02.913
<v 1>Okay.</v>

352
00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:04.170
<v 0>Let's take one more question.</v>

353
00:22:05.420 --> 00:22:08.330
<v 3>How do you diagnose when something is referred?</v>

354
00:22:08.331 --> 00:22:13.331
Pain versus like pain in the locale or injury in the location where the pain is

355
00:22:13.911 --> 00:22:14.530
felt.

356
00:22:14.530 --> 00:22:17.560
<v 0>So I don't ever diagnose because I don't have a medical degree,</v>

357
00:22:18.190 --> 00:22:21.040
but ISS w with referred pain,
it's pretty,

358
00:22:21.041 --> 00:22:23.230
there's some simple guidelines.

359
00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:26.290
So there are parts of the body that referring parts of the body that doubt.

360
00:22:26.620 --> 00:22:31.030
So the neck,
shoulders,
spine,
sacrum,

361
00:22:31.470 --> 00:22:36.010
she is here.
And hips,
I'll refer pain,
the elbows,

362
00:22:36.340 --> 00:22:40.570
uh,
the wrists,
the hands,
the knees,
the feet,
they don't.

363
00:22:41.590 --> 00:22:46.090
So if someone has a pain here and they're telling me they have a shoulder

364
00:22:46.091 --> 00:22:50.440
injury,
chances are that they have a neck injury.

365
00:22:50.870 --> 00:22:53.860
I work with,
I work with doctors to check all of these things out also.

366
00:22:53.861 --> 00:22:58.861
So I have people go and get properly diagnosed.

367
00:22:59.470 --> 00:23:03.190
Does that make sense?
But as far as referred,
pain goes.
You know,
it's,

368
00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:04.061
I've had people,

369
00:23:04.061 --> 00:23:06.930
I had a circus performer come to meetings and I have this terrible shoulder pain

370
00:23:07.930 --> 00:23:12.220
any,
but I can't figure it out.
Right?
So I was like,
well,

371
00:23:12.370 --> 00:23:13.660
I don't think you have a shoulder pain.
He's like,
no,

372
00:23:13.661 --> 00:23:16.510
I'm sure I have a shoulder pain.
And I was like,
go ahead and turn your neck.

373
00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:18.520
And he's like,
oh,
that hurts my shoulder.
Weirds

374
00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:24.010
so it's not like it's not rocket scientist if you know about it,

375
00:23:24.011 --> 00:23:27.310
it's not that difficult to figure out.
Does that make sense?
Yeah.
Yeah.

376
00:23:29.080 --> 00:23:31.990
<v 3>When you say that only those areas of referral happened,</v>

377
00:23:31.991 --> 00:23:36.880
you mean tendon ligament referral as opposed to nerf referral?
Right.
Okay.

378
00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:37.953
Thank you.
I just want to,

379
00:23:38.190 --> 00:23:41.010
<v 0>yeah,
if you have,
if you have a nerve this damage at any point,</v>

380
00:23:41.011 --> 00:23:45.060
then that's going to,
you're going to feel that downstream.
Yeah.
All right,

381
00:23:45.500 --> 00:23:49.070
so let's say,
so this will speak more to your question.

382
00:23:49.310 --> 00:23:52.040
Let's say you,
you've had some injuries,

383
00:23:52.041 --> 00:23:56.090
you've gotten some treatment that's not really working,
right?

384
00:23:56.390 --> 00:23:59.180
What's happening?
So

385
00:24:00.890 --> 00:24:04.040
to be super clear,
I don't heal anybody,
right?

386
00:24:04.220 --> 00:24:07.550
The work that I do get things out of the way,
it helps align things.

387
00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:08.810
They don't actually do the healing.

388
00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:11.810
What does the healing in your body is your immune system?

389
00:24:12.170 --> 00:24:17.150
The immune system does the healing.
So if someone's not healing,

390
00:24:17.390 --> 00:24:22.310
then I start taking a look at what are the things that are affecting your main

391
00:24:22.311 --> 00:24:22.611
system.

392
00:24:22.611 --> 00:24:27.260
Now there's five different things that we're going to talk about that you have

393
00:24:27.261 --> 00:24:31.610
control over that effect,
that impact your immune system,

394
00:24:32.180 --> 00:24:36.230
which does the healing right to div varying degrees of success.

395
00:24:37.580 --> 00:24:42.200
So the first thing,
and we touched on earlier,
is nutrition.

396
00:24:43.430 --> 00:24:46.940
If you imagine that your body is a house,
right?

397
00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:50.960
The materials you use to build it in the body is constantly rebuilding itself.

398
00:24:51.620 --> 00:24:55.880
The materials that you use to rebuild it is going to have a huge impact,
right?

399
00:24:55.881 --> 00:24:57.500
So if you're building it out of Balsa Wood,

400
00:24:57.730 --> 00:25:00.230
you're going to have a lot of problems.
If you just bump into the wall,

401
00:25:00.410 --> 00:25:02.390
that wall's going to have a dent in it,
right?

402
00:25:02.570 --> 00:25:04.970
There's some people where all they have to do is,
you know,

403
00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:07.430
they did get injuries all the time.
They don't know how that happens.

404
00:25:09.170 --> 00:25:12.260
So a few things that you can pay attention to.

405
00:25:12.261 --> 00:25:17.261
The question around nutrition is multiple joint inflammation,

406
00:25:18.890 --> 00:25:23.750
right?
The beginnings of arthritis often shows up in the fingers and the toes.

407
00:25:23.751 --> 00:25:25.700
And the wrists,
even the hips.

408
00:25:26.690 --> 00:25:29.210
So that's a like low hanging fruit.

409
00:25:29.210 --> 00:25:31.490
Like there is something going on with the nutrition.

410
00:25:31.491 --> 00:25:33.170
And now there's two components to nutrition.

411
00:25:33.740 --> 00:25:37.190
There's intake and there's absorption,
right?

412
00:25:37.310 --> 00:25:41.450
So there's what you put into your mouth and then there's what your body takes in

413
00:25:41.510 --> 00:25:43.310
into itself.
Does that make sense?

414
00:25:44.450 --> 00:25:49.100
So we'll talk about a few things in nutrition that pertain to injuries.

415
00:25:49.670 --> 00:25:54.560
First one,
guess what?
Your muscles,
tendons,
ligaments,

416
00:25:54.590 --> 00:25:57.680
joints,
guess what they're made out of protein.

417
00:25:58.550 --> 00:26:02.630
So if you are either not taking in enough protein or you're not absorbing enough

418
00:26:02.631 --> 00:26:04.850
protein,
that's going to be a problem.

419
00:26:04.851 --> 00:26:07.490
Your body that can have a much harder time repairing itself,

420
00:26:07.610 --> 00:26:10.610
getting back to full integrity.
And so again,

421
00:26:10.700 --> 00:26:14.510
you're going to have injuries much more likely for them to recur.

422
00:26:16.970 --> 00:26:20.540
Secondly,
sugar.

423
00:26:21.350 --> 00:26:26.350
So sugar is very well documented at this point that sugar has some negative

424
00:26:27.501 --> 00:26:30.710
impacts on your immune system's ability to function.

425
00:26:31.940 --> 00:26:33.950
This goes also for fake sugars.

426
00:26:34.190 --> 00:26:37.760
So I had a housemate who she liked to eat healthy,

427
00:26:37.761 --> 00:26:42.761
but she loved diet soda and she was complaining of some pretty bad arthritic

428
00:26:44.431 --> 00:26:49.230
knee pain.
And I wasn't treating her at all,
but I just mentioned this to her.

429
00:26:49.231 --> 00:26:52.080
I was like,
oh,
well arthritic sugar,

430
00:26:52.170 --> 00:26:56.610
fake sugars especially can really impact your joints.
And so she was like,

431
00:26:56.640 --> 00:26:59.640
all right,
I'm going to like not have diet soda for months.
And she was like,

432
00:26:59.641 --> 00:27:04.641
went for it in two weeks her knee pain was completely gone and it has been for

433
00:27:06.391 --> 00:27:11.220
years.
It hasn't come back.
And neither is the Diet Soda.
So it's,

434
00:27:11.250 --> 00:27:16.140
it's not subtle.
It's not subtle at all.
Diet has a huge impact.

435
00:27:16.590 --> 00:27:19.230
Um,
the,

436
00:27:20.100 --> 00:27:24.150
so if you're having problems with absorption,
there's a few other signs,

437
00:27:24.870 --> 00:27:29.400
right?
So if you're having indigestion,
stomach aches,
heartburn,

438
00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:31.500
bloating,
gas,

439
00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:35.160
chances are there's something going or even bad breath.

440
00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:39.300
These are all indications that you've got something going on with your

441
00:27:39.301 --> 00:27:43.650
absorption of,
of food and your ability to take in nutrients.

442
00:27:43.980 --> 00:27:47.610
And so that's a really good time too,
in this wonderful,

443
00:27:47.611 --> 00:27:51.450
what modern world of medicine you can go and get that checked out.

444
00:27:51.451 --> 00:27:54.750
Now I work with a company that does these very sophisticated blood tests.

445
00:27:55.110 --> 00:27:59.520
The value analysis that allow you to look at are you,

446
00:27:59.610 --> 00:28:03.000
are you intaking protein properly?
Carbohydrates,
fats,

447
00:28:03.001 --> 00:28:07.350
are you digesting those things and be allow you to make adjustments or to take

448
00:28:07.351 --> 00:28:09.600
supplements that can get you back on track.

449
00:28:09.930 --> 00:28:14.640
And things like that can be hugely impactful.
And we'll get to more of why.

450
00:28:14.641 --> 00:28:19.490
Like everyone has bad digestion a little bit later.
So,
um,

451
00:28:20.820 --> 00:28:23.700
number two,
hydration.

452
00:28:24.090 --> 00:28:27.600
So hydration has three components,
water intake,

453
00:28:27.810 --> 00:28:30.270
electrolyte balance and salt intake.

454
00:28:31.710 --> 00:28:36.710
So the general recommendation for water intake is about half your body weight in

455
00:28:39.091 --> 00:28:42.960
ounces,
not half your body,
bodyweight,
half your body weight in ounces.

456
00:28:43.290 --> 00:28:48.210
Now if you are hugely athletic and doing a lot of movement,

457
00:28:48.510 --> 00:28:52.440
that's going to go up.
And if you're intaking coffee or tea,
which are diuretics,

458
00:28:52.450 --> 00:28:55.890
means you urinate free water,
right water that you would have otherwise absorbed.

459
00:28:56.460 --> 00:29:00.780
And so that ups the intake that you would need daily of water.

460
00:29:02.190 --> 00:29:06.030
So electrolytes a little bit more complicated.

461
00:29:06.031 --> 00:29:10.980
So your body is a battery,
right?
Body has an electrical charge to it.

462
00:29:11.310 --> 00:29:16.140
Now you have um,
a charge differential right there,

463
00:29:16.141 --> 00:29:18.940
positive and negative charge that um,

464
00:29:19.020 --> 00:29:22.470
that drives the of the,
uh,

465
00:29:22.500 --> 00:29:25.440
processes have a lot of cellular processes within your body.

466
00:29:25.800 --> 00:29:29.580
So there's inside yourselves is called the intracellular matrix and outside

467
00:29:29.581 --> 00:29:34.290
yourselves is called the extra extra cellular matrix.
So having a powered,
uh,

468
00:29:34.590 --> 00:29:36.900
negative positive charge differential between them,

469
00:29:37.080 --> 00:29:41.070
hugely important for nutrition delivery,

470
00:29:41.410 --> 00:29:46.210
waste removal as Moses,
all kinds of hugely important things.

471
00:29:46.390 --> 00:29:48.370
If your body battery is low,

472
00:29:48.790 --> 00:29:52.810
your ability for your body to function on many,
many,
many levels,

473
00:29:53.410 --> 00:29:55.750
especially healing,
it's going to be compromised.

474
00:29:57.460 --> 00:29:59.600
And I,
I keep,

475
00:29:59.860 --> 00:30:03.190
I bring medical grade electrolytes with me always.

476
00:30:03.670 --> 00:30:05.890
And um,
so it's,

477
00:30:05.950 --> 00:30:09.670
it's something that has a really big impact and can really improve your health

478
00:30:09.671 --> 00:30:12.430
through having a really healthy electrolyte intake.

479
00:30:13.660 --> 00:30:18.640
Now the last piece is salt.
Now I'm not talking about regular table salt,
right?

480
00:30:18.641 --> 00:30:22.450
So if you've got table salt that is white and crystalline and dry,

481
00:30:22.810 --> 00:30:25.170
that's not the salt I'm talking about.
So best,

482
00:30:25.180 --> 00:30:28.630
all I know about is Celtic Sea salt,
which natural?
It's gray,

483
00:30:28.631 --> 00:30:32.770
it's slightly moist and it has about 85% sodium chloride.

484
00:30:32.771 --> 00:30:35.560
And 15% other minerals.

485
00:30:36.160 --> 00:30:40.990
So electrolytes are mainly about six different salts and minerals in different

486
00:30:40.991 --> 00:30:43.210
balances inside your body.

487
00:30:43.690 --> 00:30:47.140
So it's another thing that you can look to and have control over if you're

488
00:30:47.141 --> 00:30:50.020
having troubles healing from pain or injury.

489
00:30:52.480 --> 00:30:57.100
So the next one is exercise,

490
00:30:57.790 --> 00:31:01.810
right?
So movement,
movement,
like we said,

491
00:31:01.811 --> 00:31:05.650
movement is the language of the body,
right?
It's a use it or lose it.
System.

492
00:31:05.651 --> 00:31:07.270
We were made to move.

493
00:31:07.450 --> 00:31:11.680
These bodies are designed the same way roughly that they were a hundred thousand

494
00:31:11.680 --> 00:31:12.513
years ago.

495
00:31:12.910 --> 00:31:17.910
So whereas rehabilitative exercise we talked about as being specific,

496
00:31:18.011 --> 00:31:19.270
targeted and measurable

497
00:31:20.830 --> 00:31:24.250
Movement for Health is more dynamic,
integrative,

498
00:31:24.280 --> 00:31:26.500
and I would say fun,
right?

499
00:31:27.040 --> 00:31:31.810
The the best exercise that you can do,
the best exercise for you,

500
00:31:32.320 --> 00:31:34.420
period,
is the one that you do.

501
00:31:35.710 --> 00:31:38.980
If you know all kinds of great exercises and you're not doing them in a regular

502
00:31:38.981 --> 00:31:43.090
and consistent way,
they're not doing you any good.
If you like to walk,
walk.

503
00:31:43.091 --> 00:31:47.290
If you like to run,
run,
swim,
rock,
climb,
do circus arts,

504
00:31:47.470 --> 00:31:51.310
like whatever it is,
being able to integrate movement,

505
00:31:51.940 --> 00:31:55.900
movement of any kind.
And if the more varied and dynamic,
the better.

506
00:31:56.110 --> 00:31:57.220
That's hugely important.

507
00:31:58.480 --> 00:32:03.480
So there's six different movements that are essential to all macro human

508
00:32:04.121 --> 00:32:08.050
movement,
right?
So pushing,
pulling,
twisting,

509
00:32:08.740 --> 00:32:12.730
bending,
squatting and lunging,

510
00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:16.570
which is an exaggerated form of running or walking,
right?

511
00:32:16.571 --> 00:32:21.400
So having a mixture of all of those movements in your movement vocabulary,

512
00:32:21.550 --> 00:32:23.110
it's going to be hugely beneficial,
right?

513
00:32:23.111 --> 00:32:27.460
Cause when we talked about how tissues are dynamic,
right?

514
00:32:27.461 --> 00:32:28.600
So that movement,

515
00:32:29.170 --> 00:32:32.470
using that movement keeps that movement at its best.

516
00:32:34.750 --> 00:32:35.590
Lastly,

517
00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:41.060
we'll talk about sleep now when you're asleep,

518
00:32:42.440 --> 00:32:45.560
seven hearing some chuckles.
So when you're,
when you're asleep,

519
00:32:46.190 --> 00:32:50.420
your body does a large portion of the physical healing.

520
00:32:51.110 --> 00:32:54.820
It's like throughout that 24 hour cycle of a day,
a lot of your healing,

521
00:32:54.890 --> 00:32:59.210
physical healing is happening when you're asleep.
Now there's lots of,
you know,

522
00:32:59.310 --> 00:33:01.700
different studies about sleep and you know,

523
00:33:01.701 --> 00:33:04.730
I think the general consensus is 77 to eight hours.

524
00:33:04.760 --> 00:33:07.790
Now there's another way of looking at this.

525
00:33:09.140 --> 00:33:11.990
Who here regularly wakes up and feels rested?

526
00:33:14.660 --> 00:33:16.970
Okay,
a few of you but not many.

527
00:33:17.450 --> 00:33:21.470
So this may be an indication that you're not.

528
00:33:21.650 --> 00:33:25.220
There's two co at the end.
There's two components here to sleep.

529
00:33:25.490 --> 00:33:29.630
There's quality and quantity,
right?
So some people need eight hours,

530
00:33:29.631 --> 00:33:34.100
some people need five.
But the general marker is when you wake up,

531
00:33:34.130 --> 00:33:38.850
you aren't like ready to go.
Right?
So sweet.

532
00:33:38.870 --> 00:33:41.930
And so again,
if you're not,
if you're not sleeping perfectly or not going to die,

533
00:33:41.931 --> 00:33:45.260
you're not going to fall apart.
But it's one of the things to look at,
right?

534
00:33:45.680 --> 00:33:50.630
And if you have like two or more of these things really out of whack,
I wouldn't,

535
00:33:50.631 --> 00:33:54.470
I'm not,
I'm not surprised when I see someone who's got quite a few injuries.

536
00:33:55.970 --> 00:34:00.530
So,
uh,
that's sleep.
Sleep is really important.

537
00:34:01.850 --> 00:34:05.840
Now there's another system that interfaces with your immune system and that's

538
00:34:05.841 --> 00:34:10.130
your nervous system,
right?
So again,
our,
this body is the same.

539
00:34:10.131 --> 00:34:15.040
It was a hundred thousand years ago and we're wired for a different life,

540
00:34:15.041 --> 00:34:16.550
right?
So back then,

541
00:34:17.450 --> 00:34:22.450
stress looked like there's a tiger and my system goes into,

542
00:34:23.870 --> 00:34:25.730
if you guys know about the autonomic nervous system,

543
00:34:25.731 --> 00:34:29.150
you've got fight or flight and restaurant giant.
Just so I see a tiger,

544
00:34:29.450 --> 00:34:30.980
I go into fight or flight,
right?

545
00:34:30.980 --> 00:34:35.150
So I'm either going to fight until one of us has gone or I'm going to run like

546
00:34:35.151 --> 00:34:35.984
hell.

547
00:34:37.250 --> 00:34:40.370
And then so let's say fight it and I killed the tiger,

548
00:34:41.180 --> 00:34:45.900
then I get to relax,
rest maybe eat right?
And,

549
00:34:45.901 --> 00:34:50.450
and the system comes down.
Now when,

550
00:34:50.600 --> 00:34:55.010
when I go into that fight or flight state survival of my,

551
00:34:55.040 --> 00:34:56.690
like it goes to number one.

552
00:34:56.691 --> 00:35:01.040
So what that means is by blood and energy of my body goes to the big moving

553
00:35:01.041 --> 00:35:03.440
muscles of my body and to my brain,

554
00:35:03.441 --> 00:35:07.910
specifically the ones concerned with sight,
smell,
sound,

555
00:35:07.940 --> 00:35:12.290
touch,
right?
And guess what gets turned down?

556
00:35:13.700 --> 00:35:17.300
Immune system.
Digestion,
right?

557
00:35:17.480 --> 00:35:20.190
They go down in their function,
right?

558
00:35:20.191 --> 00:35:22.730
It doesn't matter how well I'm digesting something if I'm getting mauled by a

559
00:35:22.731 --> 00:35:26.060
tiger.
So,

560
00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:31.010
so we live in a world of paper tigers,
right?

561
00:35:31.040 --> 00:35:35.180
It's not so cut and dry,
you know,
the things that,
um,

562
00:35:35.420 --> 00:35:39.880
threatened our existence,
our safety,
they're different.
It's,

563
00:35:39.900 --> 00:35:44.030
it's bills,
it's debt,
it's,
you know,
bosses,
it's deadlines,
you know,
it's,

564
00:35:44.031 --> 00:35:49.020
it's much more hard to pin down things.
And there's not a clear beginning,

565
00:35:49.021 --> 00:35:51.720
middle and end.
So you know,

566
00:35:51.721 --> 00:35:54.800
for a lot of you who are living in that state of stress,
right?
Your,

567
00:35:54.900 --> 00:35:58.200
your system is ready looking for the threat,
right?

568
00:35:58.680 --> 00:36:02.160
And so you know,
so many people in the world today,

569
00:36:02.190 --> 00:36:06.720
I've meats like most people I meet I would guess have some kind of digestive

570
00:36:06.721 --> 00:36:08.430
thing going on,
right?
Because our,

571
00:36:08.490 --> 00:36:12.060
our system is not putting as much energy as it could to that.

572
00:36:12.570 --> 00:36:15.300
So what helps us with our immune system,

573
00:36:15.570 --> 00:36:19.110
with our nervous system rather well,
one of them is rest,

574
00:36:19.140 --> 00:36:22.380
not sleep but rest downtime,
wait space.

575
00:36:23.020 --> 00:36:25.920
Another time is spending time with people that we love,

576
00:36:25.921 --> 00:36:30.921
people who nourish us and this like allows our system to tune down to rest,

577
00:36:32.850 --> 00:36:37.850
to start relaxing in that allows the energy of the body to concern itself more

578
00:36:39.660 --> 00:36:44.460
with digestion and healing.
So hugely important to,
you know,

579
00:36:44.820 --> 00:36:48.150
spend time with the people that you love to give yourself white space,

580
00:36:48.180 --> 00:36:51.270
schedule it out and defendant,
defendant,

581
00:36:51.271 --> 00:36:54.330
like your most important meaning cause really important.

582
00:36:56.820 --> 00:36:59.460
So if you concern yourself with all of those things,

583
00:36:59.461 --> 00:37:03.540
this is not going to just mean less injury and pain.

584
00:37:04.020 --> 00:37:07.350
It's also in most cases going to mean longer life,

585
00:37:07.830 --> 00:37:12.360
more clarity of your mind.
Right?
So there's um,

586
00:37:12.900 --> 00:37:14.460
you know,
it's in service of being out of pain,

587
00:37:14.461 --> 00:37:17.190
but it's also in service of living a really good life.

588
00:37:20.240 --> 00:37:21.180
<v 1>So thank you.</v>

589
00:37:30.040 --> 00:37:33.100
<v 0>So let's take,
let's take some questions.</v>

590
00:37:34.790 --> 00:37:36.980
<v 2>What of these factors,
which ones are,</v>

591
00:37:37.240 --> 00:37:39.740
or I guess what are some practical tips for developing children?

592
00:37:39.741 --> 00:37:42.230
So it seems like with many developmental things,

593
00:37:42.380 --> 00:37:45.740
there's certain critical windows where you really want to get certain things,

594
00:37:45.741 --> 00:37:48.740
right?
So what if you were talking to parents or to teachers,

595
00:37:48.980 --> 00:37:52.430
what are the most important things to focus on in childhood so that you're less

596
00:37:52.431 --> 00:37:53.660
injury prone as an adult?

597
00:37:55.640 --> 00:38:00.640
<v 0>So the number one to me would be nutrition,</v>

598
00:38:01.190 --> 00:38:01.431
right?

599
00:38:01.431 --> 00:38:06.140
So when I was a kid I didn't eat very well and I pushed my body really hard.

600
00:38:06.141 --> 00:38:09.410
And by the time I was 13,
I bought,
he was a wreck.

601
00:38:09.830 --> 00:38:13.970
Now I was in rough streets for like six years before I started getting really

602
00:38:13.971 --> 00:38:18.770
regular treatment.
And changing my,
how I eat.
So,
and especially,

603
00:38:18.800 --> 00:38:20.420
you know,
you're as a child,

604
00:38:20.421 --> 00:38:23.000
you're building the foundation for the rest of your life.

605
00:38:23.001 --> 00:38:27.140
So the food that you're putting in is actually turning it on off.

606
00:38:27.141 --> 00:38:31.220
I've just different genes and epigenetics that are going to sort of set the

607
00:38:31.221 --> 00:38:32.810
stage for you moving forward.

608
00:38:33.240 --> 00:38:36.520
<v 2>Oh,
I was wondering if you can,
what inflammation</v>

609
00:38:36.520 --> 00:38:41.470
<v 0>is and why does like Ibuprofen help heal it?
So,
okay.</v>

610
00:38:41.500 --> 00:38:46.360
Yes.
Inflammation is,
um,
a swelling.

611
00:38:46.361 --> 00:38:49.360
So it means that there's fluid,
right?

612
00:38:49.361 --> 00:38:53.980
There's fluid that's sort of protecting things that gets happens in the body.

613
00:38:53.981 --> 00:38:57.910
So,
um,
we can talk about it in the case of joints,
right?

614
00:38:57.911 --> 00:39:02.911
So if you have an injury to two or more tendons in the shoulder or one or more

615
00:39:05.891 --> 00:39:07.900
ligaments in the knee,
um,

616
00:39:08.500 --> 00:39:13.500
that joint is going to as a protect or even if you're just having an impact and

617
00:39:13.811 --> 00:39:17.920
then you can have an arthritis.
Arthritis just means inflammation of the joint,

618
00:39:18.220 --> 00:39:22.600
right?
So,
and inflammation essentially swelling,
heat and those,

619
00:39:22.690 --> 00:39:27.100
those two components.
So when you have that,
um,

620
00:39:28.090 --> 00:39:32.980
that,
um,
it's,
so you're have usually like in the knee,

621
00:39:32.981 --> 00:39:37.030
you'll have like a teaspoon's amount of fluid and when you get it inflamed,

622
00:39:37.150 --> 00:39:40.090
you can have several tablespoons worth of fluid.

623
00:39:40.090 --> 00:39:43.420
So you're going to have swelling and it's going to have pain,
limited mobility.

624
00:39:44.170 --> 00:39:47.620
And so,
um,
that is going to have,
you know,
again,

625
00:39:47.650 --> 00:39:51.820
it's going to start changing your gait and your posture.
Um,
and then there's,

626
00:39:52.450 --> 00:39:56.590
there's a lot of different ways in,
right?
So I don't know specifically,

627
00:39:57.110 --> 00:39:57.943
um,

628
00:39:58.150 --> 00:40:02.920
about like systemic drugs like Ibuprofen and how that works chemically,

629
00:40:02.921 --> 00:40:05.530
but I can talk to,
um,
antiinflammatories.

630
00:40:06.360 --> 00:40:09.970
So the antiinflammatories like if you had an antiinflammatory injection,

631
00:40:10.540 --> 00:40:12.970
so you can imagine that.
Um,

632
00:40:13.480 --> 00:40:17.260
so imagine like the a street of Boston that's really under construction,
right?

633
00:40:17.261 --> 00:40:18.340
So there's holes in the road,

634
00:40:18.341 --> 00:40:22.690
there's piles of gravel and there's a lot of machines and there's a lot of

635
00:40:22.691 --> 00:40:23.740
construction workers.

636
00:40:24.100 --> 00:40:28.690
So that anti-inflammatory comes in is essentially some guy who comes in and
says,

637
00:40:28.691 --> 00:40:30.010
everybody clear out.

638
00:40:30.430 --> 00:40:34.240
And so they take their trucks and all the people and they clear out.

639
00:40:34.480 --> 00:40:39.430
But what's gets left behind is the holes in the politic Raffle,
right?

640
00:40:39.431 --> 00:40:44.350
So the inflammation is one step in the healing process,
right?
The heat.

641
00:40:44.351 --> 00:40:45.530
And that brings that,

642
00:40:45.531 --> 00:40:48.730
it brings the immune system and it starts rebuilding things.

643
00:40:49.450 --> 00:40:51.450
And so when,
um,

644
00:40:51.550 --> 00:40:55.450
in the case of like a mild trauma to a joint or something,
you,

645
00:40:55.480 --> 00:40:56.710
it's in that case,

646
00:40:56.711 --> 00:41:00.940
it's mostly just like machines and trucks in this analogy and you clear those

647
00:41:00.941 --> 00:41:03.610
out and then you don't have much of a problem.
Right.

648
00:41:03.611 --> 00:41:04.750
And it's just get rid of that.

649
00:41:05.440 --> 00:41:09.580
In the case of when you have like a lot of damage to the tissue and then you

650
00:41:09.880 --> 00:41:14.320
clear that out,
you've just sort of got,
you know,
hopefully it's,
you know,

651
00:41:14.321 --> 00:41:14.711
it's gone,

652
00:41:14.711 --> 00:41:17.800
but often you've got this damaged tissue that sort of unfinished that's being

653
00:41:17.801 --> 00:41:18.634
left behind.

654
00:41:18.940 --> 00:41:23.500
And so it makes it pretty easy for to get re injured.

655
00:41:23.920 --> 00:41:28.920
And so you hear about these football players who get a bicep tendon injury and

656
00:41:29.351 --> 00:41:33.040
they go and get an antiinflammatory injection and then they injure it again,

657
00:41:33.110 --> 00:41:33.291
right?

658
00:41:33.291 --> 00:41:36.290
Cause they see there's still damaged tissue there and they'll go to a different

659
00:41:36.291 --> 00:41:38.840
doctrine.
Bulic I haven't had one yet.
I need another injection.

660
00:41:39.530 --> 00:41:41.840
And then they'll entertain it again and I'll go to a third one and be like,

661
00:41:41.841 --> 00:41:43.850
I need another injection.
And then,
um,

662
00:41:44.090 --> 00:41:49.090
they'll go and they'll do too much and it can actually pop off and roll up into

663
00:41:49.311 --> 00:41:53.690
the shoulder or down,
which is pretty gross.
But,
but so that's,

664
00:41:53.900 --> 00:41:55.610
that's how antiinflammatories work.
Again,

665
00:41:55.611 --> 00:41:57.950
I'm sorry I can't speak specifically to Ibuprofen,

666
00:41:57.951 --> 00:42:01.820
but in general with antiinflammatories,
that's how it,
that's how it works.

667
00:42:02.660 --> 00:42:05.150
Um,
did that answer your question more or less?
Okay.

668
00:42:06.710 --> 00:42:10.840
<v 4>Uh,
so you spoke a little earlier about when a muscle is injured,</v>

669
00:42:10.841 --> 00:42:13.810
you want to rehabilitate it and work it in the right way.

670
00:42:14.080 --> 00:42:17.610
Can you be more specific about what makes,
uh,

671
00:42:17.770 --> 00:42:21.790
a rehabilitation exercise the right way for that type of injury?

672
00:42:22.080 --> 00:42:26.730
<v 0>Sure.
So you want to,
so it's specific and targeted,
right?</v>

673
00:42:26.731 --> 00:42:31.140
So that means that you're actually putting tension through that tissue that's

674
00:42:31.141 --> 00:42:32.520
injured,
right.

675
00:42:32.700 --> 00:42:37.230
If I am doing a rehabilitative exercise to get my trap stronger when I have a,

676
00:42:37.650 --> 00:42:41.820
you know,
or my rhomboids.
So true.
These muscles in the back here when I've got,

677
00:42:42.030 --> 00:42:44.700
you know,
one of the rotator cuff injury muscle is injured,

678
00:42:44.880 --> 00:42:46.710
it's not going to do much for me.
Right?

679
00:42:46.711 --> 00:42:51.300
So you want a specific and then you also want it measure it.
So,
um,

680
00:42:51.360 --> 00:42:55.590
I always have people do it with weights rather than bance.

681
00:42:55.920 --> 00:42:59.850
The reason being that it's not,
it's not measurable,
right?
So if I've got a band,

682
00:43:00.510 --> 00:43:03.510
bands are great if you're just like for health,
right?

683
00:43:03.720 --> 00:43:05.610
But if you're trying to rehabilitate an injury,

684
00:43:05.611 --> 00:43:06.900
you want to be able to measure it.

685
00:43:07.140 --> 00:43:10.710
So I start people out at one pound typically and,

686
00:43:11.280 --> 00:43:13.290
and see how that is right.
With a band,

687
00:43:13.470 --> 00:43:16.140
it has a certain amount of strength here at different amount of strength here in

688
00:43:16.141 --> 00:43:19.970
a different amount of strength here and it degrades over time.
So it's gonna,

689
00:43:19.990 --> 00:43:23.010
it's,
it's,
it's more difficult to measure.

690
00:43:23.540 --> 00:43:27.140
<v 4>So it sounds like what you're saying is it's specifically about isolating the</v>

691
00:43:27.141 --> 00:43:30.860
muscle that was injured and making sure that that is what is being activated.

692
00:43:31.090 --> 00:43:34.090
<v 0>Yes.
And then again,
we're talking about addressing the direct costs.</v>

693
00:43:34.091 --> 00:43:37.600
So there's lots of practitioners who work with indirect causes,
right?

694
00:43:37.601 --> 00:43:42.100
Working with muscle balance and that kind of thing.
It's more in the PT Realm.
Um,

695
00:43:42.160 --> 00:43:42.730
and that's,

696
00:43:42.730 --> 00:43:45.640
that's not what I do like that can help again with the indirect things,

697
00:43:45.760 --> 00:43:48.220
if we get posture and alignment happening,
then off,

698
00:43:48.640 --> 00:43:53.230
sometimes that injury will just stop getting exacerbated and it will heal up.

699
00:43:53.500 --> 00:43:54.221
In other cases,

700
00:43:54.221 --> 00:43:58.090
you actually need to address this specific injury itself and treat it directly.

701
00:43:58.091 --> 00:44:02.440
Otherwise,
you know,
if I like,
you know,
terror,
you know,

702
00:44:02.441 --> 00:44:03.610
something pretty badly,

703
00:44:03.730 --> 00:44:05.980
but I get my alignment really good that Terry is still there.

704
00:44:06.160 --> 00:44:09.460
Like I still need to address that.
Does that make sense?
Yeah.
Thank you.
Great.

705
00:44:11.780 --> 00:44:14.300
<v 2>I just had a brief followup question about nutrition.
Um,</v>

706
00:44:14.330 --> 00:44:16.730
lots of people have all sorts of health advice.
Um,

707
00:44:16.980 --> 00:44:18.650
so this means a lot of things to different people.

708
00:44:18.651 --> 00:44:23.420
So I'm curious if you could just very briefly talk about what you mean.

709
00:44:23.570 --> 00:44:26.930
Why are like the key things that you're saying?
Like say I sugars whenever,

710
00:44:26.931 --> 00:44:29.700
but key things you mean by good nutrition?
So,

711
00:44:29.860 --> 00:44:34.050
<v 0>right.
Um,
that's one thing I did leave out a little bit.</v>

712
00:44:34.051 --> 00:44:35.760
So when I,

713
00:44:36.180 --> 00:44:39.420
we could have a big debate right about like nutrition and what's the right food

714
00:44:39.421 --> 00:44:40.830
to eat and what's the wrong food to eat.

715
00:44:40.831 --> 00:44:44.520
And basically there's some data on pretty much any food being bad.

716
00:44:46.800 --> 00:44:48.270
So I don't want to get into that discussion.

717
00:44:48.271 --> 00:44:51.030
But what I will say is that if you're eating organic food,

718
00:44:51.031 --> 00:44:52.890
and I know they have a lot of that available here,

719
00:44:53.040 --> 00:44:57.740
that's much better than inorganic food,
right?
So if you're having,
um,

720
00:44:57.890 --> 00:45:02.550
it means less pesticides and usually it means more micro nutrients,
right?

721
00:45:02.551 --> 00:45:06.870
So a lot of agriculture net today is,
is fertilized with NPK,
right?

722
00:45:06.871 --> 00:45:09.060
So nitrogen,
potassium and phosphorus,

723
00:45:09.061 --> 00:45:11.790
which is not all of the nutrients we need to survive.

724
00:45:12.540 --> 00:45:17.340
And we have less and less nutrients in the soil these days.

725
00:45:17.670 --> 00:45:21.090
So that because of topsoil loss,
it's a whole other conversation.

726
00:45:21.420 --> 00:45:23.610
So that's one piece is like eating organic food.

727
00:45:23.611 --> 00:45:25.830
The other thing is eating at home,
right?

728
00:45:26.070 --> 00:45:29.670
So the basic factors when you eat out in a restaurant,

729
00:45:29.671 --> 00:45:32.070
unless it's explicitly stated otherwise,

730
00:45:32.220 --> 00:45:36.000
restaurants tend to carry lower quality food.
That's just how it is.

731
00:45:37.890 --> 00:45:38.550
And again,
some,

732
00:45:38.550 --> 00:45:42.060
some places have like grass fed meat and organic food and like that's a

733
00:45:42.061 --> 00:45:45.570
different story and that's wonderful when you encounter that.
Um,

734
00:45:46.350 --> 00:45:50.490
and you know,
again,
like 10,
like local,
right?

735
00:45:50.491 --> 00:45:54.780
So as foods that are fresher foods that are,
um,
you know,

736
00:45:54.781 --> 00:45:57.120
and having a balance of fats,

737
00:45:57.121 --> 00:46:01.620
carbohydrates and protein is also really,

738
00:46:01.621 --> 00:46:02.850
really important.
Right?

739
00:46:02.851 --> 00:46:06.990
There's always someone out there like ready to like demonize,
you know,

740
00:46:06.991 --> 00:46:10.080
some aspect of food.
But,
you know,

741
00:46:10.081 --> 00:46:14.170
really on the most basic level having like your body is made up of protein,

742
00:46:14.200 --> 00:46:15.150
carbohydrates and fats.

743
00:46:15.151 --> 00:46:20.070
Like you need those things and in good quantities and in and,
um,
good quality.

744
00:46:20.760 --> 00:46:22.740
Does that answer your question?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay.

745
00:46:23.090 --> 00:46:26.660
<v 2>Um,
I a followup question on the inflammation.
Um,</v>

746
00:46:27.260 --> 00:46:28.520
so would,

747
00:46:29.600 --> 00:46:34.600
so I'm going to PT for a number of injuries and a lot of time and they're all

748
00:46:35.001 --> 00:46:39.650
tendon injuries.
Um,
and most of the time they'll,
they'll say,
you know,

749
00:46:39.710 --> 00:46:42.110
ice afterward,
um,

750
00:46:42.620 --> 00:46:45.860
maybe even every day or like every night.
Um,

751
00:46:46.910 --> 00:46:50.770
is that suppressing that,
um,

752
00:46:51.530 --> 00:46:56.530
inflammatory response that would help heal or is that different than like

753
00:46:56.931 --> 00:46:58.040
cortisone injections?

754
00:46:58.250 --> 00:47:01.230
<v 0>So it's dead.
It's different than cortisone injections.
Cold courage,</v>

755
00:47:01.240 --> 00:47:05.130
really in a kind of a controversy.
Um,
I,

756
00:47:05.560 --> 00:47:06.860
I don't have anything against it.

757
00:47:06.861 --> 00:47:11.780
I often have people use heat or cold after doing their exercises and I really go

758
00:47:11.781 --> 00:47:16.160
with what people,
um,
what people prefer both.

759
00:47:16.220 --> 00:47:20.180
So a cold is Aveo a visa,
a constructor,

760
00:47:20.181 --> 00:47:23.780
and heat is a phase of dilator,
which basically means it makes your,

761
00:47:23.990 --> 00:47:27.980
your blood vessels smaller in the case of ice and bigger in the case of he now

762
00:47:27.981 --> 00:47:30.940
my preference is to them do both.
Right?

763
00:47:30.941 --> 00:47:33.310
So doing a minute and if he'd,

764
00:47:33.320 --> 00:47:35.810
and then 30 seconds of cold and then it made it if he,

765
00:47:35.811 --> 00:47:39.250
because what you create in that scenario is a pump rate,

766
00:47:39.430 --> 00:47:41.830
dilation and then construction and then dilation.

767
00:47:41.831 --> 00:47:45.460
And then construction blood is the bringer of nutrients is to take her away of

768
00:47:45.461 --> 00:47:49.900
waste.
And it's the deliver of the immune system.
So blood flow really good.

769
00:47:50.950 --> 00:47:52.150
Does that make sense?
Yeah.
Yeah.

770
00:47:52.850 --> 00:47:54.660
<v 3>All right.
So this is sort of a,</v>

771
00:47:54.960 --> 00:47:59.730
probably a very basic like embarrassingly lack of body awareness question,

772
00:47:59.731 --> 00:48:04.410
but like how do you tell the difference between injuries and like sort of

773
00:48:04.680 --> 00:48:09.120
regular,
you know,
muscle soreness from having been active all the time and like,

774
00:48:10.560 --> 00:48:13.020
cause I feel like,
you know,
being an active person,

775
00:48:13.021 --> 00:48:16.440
I have a lot of aches and pains all over the place,

776
00:48:16.441 --> 00:48:19.140
but like I never know whether it's like something is broken or whether this is

777
00:48:19.141 --> 00:48:24.090
just normal for having done things or,
yeah.

778
00:48:24.340 --> 00:48:28.510
<v 0>Got It.
Okay.
So there's a few things you can consider it.
One of them is,</v>

779
00:48:29.170 --> 00:48:30.220
again,
it's totally like,

780
00:48:30.221 --> 00:48:33.130
it's totally normal and natural to feel sore after exercise.

781
00:48:34.270 --> 00:48:37.750
What you're going to find is that most often that has is occurring in the muscle

782
00:48:37.751 --> 00:48:40.540
belly.
So if you feel it in the middle of the muscle,

783
00:48:41.200 --> 00:48:45.160
then it's probably normal soreness.
If you feel it on the tendon,

784
00:48:46.060 --> 00:48:50.980
like right on that stringy bit,
that's usually has a bit less sensation.
Um,

785
00:48:51.520 --> 00:48:55.510
then I'm starting to have a different conversation.

786
00:48:55.511 --> 00:48:58.270
The other thing is consistency.
Is it lasting long?
Wait,

787
00:48:58.271 --> 00:49:00.740
if it only lasts three or four days,
um,

788
00:49:00.930 --> 00:49:04.990
we had a maximum then it was probably muscle soreness or it,
you know,

789
00:49:04.991 --> 00:49:07.750
it's case there are a lot of injuries.
I mean,
injuries happen all the time.

790
00:49:07.900 --> 00:49:11.170
They're totally normal and natural for us to get injured.
But what's awesome,

791
00:49:11.171 --> 00:49:14.620
normally the nationalist Freston heal and most of the time that we get injured,

792
00:49:15.130 --> 00:49:18.360
we heal.
And so if,

793
00:49:18.380 --> 00:49:20.680
if you've got something and two weeks in,

794
00:49:20.830 --> 00:49:23.950
it's the same thing and it's bothering you in the same way,
well,
it's time to,

795
00:49:23.951 --> 00:49:27.610
you know,
it's time to go and get something checked out.
Does that make sense?

796
00:49:27.640 --> 00:49:31.510
Yeah.
Um,
also it's going to be super tender,
right?
Can you just like touch it?

797
00:49:31.850 --> 00:49:34.570
And if I like exercise and I just sit down in my hamstrings,

798
00:49:34.571 --> 00:49:37.600
like sitting on the chairs and that was,
I'm like,
whoa.
Um,

799
00:49:37.930 --> 00:49:41.220
and the last thing is specific,
um,

800
00:49:42.250 --> 00:49:44.920
specific movement being painful,
right?
If you're like,

801
00:49:45.100 --> 00:49:49.660
I have pain here every time I do this right?
That's really pretty clearly.
Like,

802
00:49:49.661 --> 00:49:52.360
oh,
that did something wrong.
Does that make sense?
Yeah.
Yes.
Okay.

803
00:49:53.970 --> 00:49:55.540
I've got time for one more question.

804
00:49:57.730 --> 00:50:01.780
<v 5>I'll try and make it a good one.
Yeah.
Um,
so when I have,
uh,
an injury,</v>

805
00:50:01.810 --> 00:50:04.570
it's sort of in the acute stage where I'm like,
ah,
so I mean he's pop,

806
00:50:04.571 --> 00:50:07.060
like I definitely just pulled something,
would I,

807
00:50:07.120 --> 00:50:09.070
what I'm wondering is I know that,
okay,

808
00:50:09.071 --> 00:50:11.890
so the immediate thing is going to happen is like scar tissue is going to start

809
00:50:11.891 --> 00:50:15.280
forming or you'd be working with that and like making sure that,
you know,

810
00:50:15.290 --> 00:50:18.610
it's not like solidifying and,
and you know,

811
00:50:18.611 --> 00:50:22.150
we're working through it and making sure it's healing well.
But I also feel like,

812
00:50:22.180 --> 00:50:25.360
oh,
maybe I should rest for like a couple of days or a week,

813
00:50:25.630 --> 00:50:27.070
like right after it's happened.

814
00:50:27.080 --> 00:50:31.040
And so do you have any advice on like how long should you be resting and injury

815
00:50:31.041 --> 00:50:31.431
when you know,

816
00:50:31.431 --> 00:50:34.640
what's just happened versus how long could you be jumping right in and like

817
00:50:34.670 --> 00:50:36.230
trying to rehab it?
Totally.

818
00:50:36.500 --> 00:50:41.270
<v 0>So first thing is if you hear like a pop like that,
like,
like,</v>

819
00:50:42.020 --> 00:50:45.710
especially if it swells up within five minutes,
doctor,

820
00:50:45.920 --> 00:50:49.850
like you want to go to a doctor and make sure it's not torn in half are hanging

821
00:50:49.851 --> 00:50:51.920
on by a thread,
excuse me.
Um,

822
00:50:52.640 --> 00:50:54.860
that means that you would want it to get like,

823
00:50:54.861 --> 00:50:57.140
repaired repairative surgery pretty quick.

824
00:50:57.230 --> 00:51:01.850
Most of the time that's not what's happening,
right.
In that case it's,

825
00:51:01.900 --> 00:51:06.050
it's good to go see someone fairly quickly.
Um,

826
00:51:06.890 --> 00:51:11.390
again,
if you have like huge swelling,
take some time,
go to a doctor.

827
00:51:12.740 --> 00:51:16.610
Um,
and then what was the other part of your question?

828
00:51:17.330 --> 00:51:18.530
Like how long to wait?

829
00:51:18.640 --> 00:51:21.730
<v 5>Yeah,
like I,
I'm not,
I'm not clear on how long I shouldn't,
you know,</v>

830
00:51:21.790 --> 00:51:25.600
ref like rest,
ice,
compression,
elevation,
like at versus how long should I start?

831
00:51:25.601 --> 00:51:29.530
Like,
when should I start stretching and rolling and,
you know,
maybe trying to,

832
00:51:29.600 --> 00:51:31.540
you know,
work the muscle.

833
00:51:31.750 --> 00:51:36.300
<v 0>So if you have an injury like that,
you wouldn't,
I,
you could wait,</v>

834
00:51:36.910 --> 00:51:40.480
you know,
at by about a week,
but you wouldn't want to do anything that hurts,

835
00:51:40.481 --> 00:51:43.000
right?
If you're like,
oh,
I gotta stretch it.
Like you know,

836
00:51:43.020 --> 00:51:45.820
I'm really go in and you wouldn't want to do that.
Right.

837
00:51:45.821 --> 00:51:48.610
So you would want to do something for a gentle,
um,

838
00:51:49.420 --> 00:51:53.630
but I would wait at the maximum of a week if you're really clear like,
oh,

839
00:51:53.631 --> 00:51:54.730
I've entered myself.

840
00:51:54.970 --> 00:51:59.710
Like go see someone if you're not sure and something sticks around for two

841
00:51:59.711 --> 00:52:04.330
weeks,
go see someone to answer your question.
Great.

842
00:52:04.720 --> 00:52:07.930
I think we have time for one more if I've got it.

843
00:52:09.810 --> 00:52:13.770
<v 5>Yeah.
I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about um,</v>

844
00:52:13.890 --> 00:52:17.300
nerve pain and like nerve inflammation and like,
yeah.

845
00:52:17.570 --> 00:52:21.200
<v 0>Or feeling process.
Sure.</v>

846
00:52:21.201 --> 00:52:24.530
So nerves is not,
not necessarily my wheelhouse,

847
00:52:24.560 --> 00:52:28.790
but there's certain hallmarks of a nerve pain.

848
00:52:30.110 --> 00:52:34.370
So typically you're going to have three out of these,

849
00:52:34.490 --> 00:52:36.410
two or three out of these symptoms I'm about to list.

850
00:52:36.411 --> 00:52:41.030
So we would probably have constant pain,
right?
Hip pain all the time.

851
00:52:41.690 --> 00:52:46.100
Numbness or tingling all the time.
A change in reflexes,

852
00:52:46.550 --> 00:52:49.730
right.
One side of change and reflects if it happened only on one side,

853
00:52:49.970 --> 00:52:54.650
you're going to have extreme weakness.
Right.
And you're going to have,
um,

854
00:52:55.630 --> 00:52:57.650
but the weakness is going to be asymmetrical,
right?

855
00:52:57.651 --> 00:52:59.780
If someone's really weak over here and they're really weak over here,

856
00:53:00.110 --> 00:53:03.440
they're probably just really weak.
And it's going to be one sided,
typically,

857
00:53:03.620 --> 00:53:05.540
if it's in the case of a disk.

858
00:53:06.820 --> 00:53:09.200
And so if you have two or more of those,
like,

859
00:53:09.770 --> 00:53:13.370
chances are that you've got that you've got a nerf thing and you always want to

860
00:53:13.371 --> 00:53:17.060
go and,
you know,
get imaging and get those things confirmed with the doctor.

861
00:53:17.150 --> 00:53:21.290
Does that answer your question?
Yeah.
And then as far as,
you know,

862
00:53:21.410 --> 00:53:25.710
healing nerve pain,
I've heard that it's,

863
00:53:25.920 --> 00:53:28.320
it's something like if you've had a damaged nerve that it,

864
00:53:28.321 --> 00:53:31.830
he'll sit about an inch a month.
I can.
This is,
that's not my wheelhouse,

865
00:53:31.860 --> 00:53:35.700
but that's about the rate.
Again,
not if it's totally severed.
You know,

866
00:53:35.701 --> 00:53:38.700
that's a different story.
All right.
