1
00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:09.150
I am very pleased to have John Brownstein,

2
00:00:09.151 --> 00:00:12.570
chief innovation officer at Boston Children's speak here today.
I'm Paul Vargas.

3
00:00:12.571 --> 00:00:16.680
I'm the clinical lead for a health informatics for verily.
And um,

4
00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.110
I'm going to give you a brief introduction to the doctor Brownstein.
Uh,

5
00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:23.550
he's a computational epidemiologist trained at Yale University and he's also a

6
00:00:23.551 --> 00:00:26.400
professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School.
Uh,

7
00:00:26.401 --> 00:00:28.650
author of over 200 scientific articles.

8
00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.240
And in 2015 he became the chief innovation officer at Boston Children's hospital

9
00:00:33.241 --> 00:00:37.740
where he leads a team of 40 clinicians,
software engineers,
product managers,

10
00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:38.593
et Cetera,

11
00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.500
where they actually push the envelope on how technology is used in healthcare.

12
00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:49.130
I first met John when I was a biomedical informatics fellow at Harvard Medical

13
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.890
School and uh,
we invited him to give us a talk that we still speak about today.

14
00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:54.540
And that's because these were the,

15
00:00:54.541 --> 00:00:58.830
some of the topics and terms that John talked to us about his research.

16
00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:00.030
So yes,

17
00:01:00.031 --> 00:01:05.031
he talked about using geostationary satellites to use image recognition to

18
00:01:05.131 --> 00:01:07.590
evaluate how well Ebola corn genes were done.

19
00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.150
He also talked about investigating crowdsourcing of black market drug prices

20
00:01:12.151 --> 00:01:13.110
using dark web.

21
00:01:13.111 --> 00:01:17.610
And Silk Road and it included what I feel is the single best combination of

22
00:01:17.611 --> 00:01:21.270
strange abbreviations,
the World Health Organization who,

23
00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:26.620
Dea Drug Enforcement Agency,
FDA food and Drug Administration.

24
00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.690
I my personal favorite Fml,
which I am not going to explain it,

25
00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:32.220
but uh,

26
00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.390
John has been a colleague and mentor of mine and we were so impressed with his

27
00:01:36.391 --> 00:01:37.770
work as fellows.

28
00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:41.460
We were not the only ones who were interested in talking to John.
Uh,

29
00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.950
this is an article about John from CNBC.

30
00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:47.490
When big tech companies want to get in health,
they call this Harvard researcher.

31
00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:51.060
And so,
um,
Google did to,

32
00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:54.460
that's his back in 2015 and when Google flu trends,
uh,

33
00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.880
needed to be handed over to somebody who could extend the work,

34
00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:02.070
that's John and his team.
Um,
Uber is working with John.

35
00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.570
He'll talk a little bit about his work.
We had non emergent medical transport,

36
00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.360
but uh,
maybe John can tell us a little bit about how this happened.

37
00:02:09.361 --> 00:02:12.700
I heard it will involve the text to Uber,
um,

38
00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.830
about suggesting they get into healthcare.
Uh,

39
00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.260
John is also known as one of the people,
uh,

40
00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.350
who has popularized the notion of the digital phenotype.
Uh,

41
00:02:22.351 --> 00:02:25.200
with the ubiquity of technology in our lives today,

42
00:02:25.201 --> 00:02:29.730
we can leave a lot of clues about our health state in the interactions that we

43
00:02:29.731 --> 00:02:32.760
have.
We had the internet,
social media,
et Cetera,

44
00:02:32.761 --> 00:02:35.970
and John has been on the forefront of how we can harness what we consider

45
00:02:35.971 --> 00:02:38.980
nontraditional healthcare information to get a better understanding of the

46
00:02:38.981 --> 00:02:40.860
patient's state of health or disease.

47
00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.880
John is always really good at predicting where the puck's going to be and I can

48
00:02:44.881 --> 00:02:47.820
say that because he's from Montreal,
so he,
uh,
knows hockey.

49
00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:52.310
John is on the forefront of how do we use other forms of technology to advance

50
00:02:52.311 --> 00:02:52.771
health care.

51
00:02:52.771 --> 00:02:57.771
And that includes voice activation of applications in health and uh,

52
00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:00.100
that's the buildup.
John Stock,

53
00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:02.870
<v 2>which is digital phenotyping in the future of healthcare.</v>

54
00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:04.120
Please welcome John Brownstein.

55
00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:11.890
All right,
great.
Thanks Paul.
Very nice introduction.
Really appreciate it.

56
00:03:11.891 --> 00:03:13.180
It's great to be here.
Um,

57
00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:17.830
in many ways a Google's like been a sort of a connection and collaborator since

58
00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:19.810
I started in research.
Um,

59
00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:24.240
and the Boston area about 15 years ago been actually intersecting with Google

60
00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:25.750
sort of all parts actually.

61
00:03:25.751 --> 00:03:28.870
And I'll be giving you a bunch of examples of how we've worked together.

62
00:03:28.871 --> 00:03:30.340
And so many of the concepts,

63
00:03:30.341 --> 00:03:34.330
they're not super foreign to this group because much of it is drawn from sort of

64
00:03:34.331 --> 00:03:37.330
insights that you've been collecting throughout the years and ideas that have

65
00:03:37.331 --> 00:03:40.960
been driven through the understanding of how consumer tech is changing the

66
00:03:40.961 --> 00:03:42.070
landscape of healthcare.

67
00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:45.400
And that's been really the thesis of the work that I've been involved in is
like,

68
00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:47.650
well,
what is changing on the consumer landscape?

69
00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:51.010
How do we start to bring some of that technology to understand the health of

70
00:03:51.011 --> 00:03:51.844
populations,

71
00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.710
improve access to care and understand a disease outcomes in this concept of the

72
00:03:56.711 --> 00:03:57.550
digital phenotype,

73
00:03:57.551 --> 00:04:01.420
which is this idea that all the data that we generate in our day to day lives

74
00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:05.680
actually can provide meaningful information about us and collectively about

75
00:04:05.681 --> 00:04:09.180
populations.
Um,
and so I'll give you a sort of,
um,

76
00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:13.510
a level setting of why we started looking at nontraditional datasets.
So this is,

77
00:04:13.511 --> 00:04:15.820
um,
a graph of myocardial infarctions,

78
00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:19.810
heart attacks across the partners healthcare system.
That's actually not a count,

79
00:04:19.811 --> 00:04:24.550
it's a communal cumulative sum.
But,
um,
what we noticed over a,

80
00:04:24.551 --> 00:04:28.580
over a 10 year period as we saw this massive increase in heart attacks and

81
00:04:28.581 --> 00:04:33.040
merging in the early two thousands.
And what's interesting,

82
00:04:33.041 --> 00:04:36.100
and you know,
it doesn't prove causality necessarily,

83
00:04:36.101 --> 00:04:39.220
but we had the introduction of Vioxx right around that time that we started

84
00:04:39.221 --> 00:04:43.720
seeing that increase,
that increased,
went away with the withdrawal of that drug.

85
00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:45.430
And we,

86
00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:50.200
we did much validation off of this through my medical records and showed that

87
00:04:50.201 --> 00:04:52.060
there was really a connectivity between,

88
00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:57.220
through the increase of expected heart attacks across the partner system and the

89
00:04:57.221 --> 00:05:01.300
prescription of,
of this medication.
And we weren't looking at this prospectively,

90
00:05:01.301 --> 00:05:04.090
this was all retrospective data,
but it tells us that,
you know,

91
00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:07.330
there's all this mass amount of healthcare data that's being collected that

92
00:05:07.331 --> 00:05:10.570
we're not using any real appropriate weight inform our decisions.

93
00:05:10.571 --> 00:05:12.670
And there's a lot of reasons for that.

94
00:05:12.671 --> 00:05:15.280
And mostly because data siloed people own it.

95
00:05:15.281 --> 00:05:20.281
They don't sort of shared in ways to sort of optimize the care of their health

96
00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:24.460
of their populations and more broadly in public health.
At the same time,

97
00:05:24.461 --> 00:05:28.360
we know that we're generating huge amounts of data across all sorts of aspects

98
00:05:28.361 --> 00:05:31.600
of,
of the patient,
whether it's their phenotype data,

99
00:05:31.601 --> 00:05:34.960
their genotype data across their interactions with health systems.

100
00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:38.920
There's all this information that's being generated by not really used in any

101
00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:43.240
way that is valuable for the patient or at least not optimized for that patient.

102
00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:48.490
We often turn to geographic information systems.
I mean obviously the,
uh,

103
00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:49.750
the veterans of the Google map,

104
00:05:49.751 --> 00:05:53.620
of course there's a deep understanding of the fact that data layers,
um,

105
00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:56.710
are a connected by their latitude and longitude and we create a very

106
00:05:56.711 --> 00:06:01.711
comprehensive of a physical area based on that in interaction between a Latin

107
00:06:02.841 --> 00:06:06.920
lung.
Similarly,
you know,
and this is what we're trying to do at uh,

108
00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:10.280
at Harvard and many groups are doing across the world now is thinking about

109
00:06:10.281 --> 00:06:15.281
trying to organize patient data across sort of that identify or to get all that,

110
00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:19.700
those layers of information to get the most insight we can and of course do that

111
00:06:19.701 --> 00:06:24.000
across populations to get new insights.
So that's really the,

112
00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:26.030
the ideal state of the world.

113
00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:30.440
But of course it's really challenging again because of these siloed sets of data

114
00:06:30.441 --> 00:06:33.600
that exists.
And again,
many of the groups here are thinking about how,

115
00:06:33.601 --> 00:06:37.970
how to unlock the potential of these datasets at the same time.
And,

116
00:06:37.971 --> 00:06:41.870
and Paul mentioned that I took over as chief innovation officer at Boston

117
00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:41.871
Children's.

118
00:06:41.871 --> 00:06:45.350
We're really thinking about how to better use the data that we have about

119
00:06:45.351 --> 00:06:49.190
patients to help make better informed decisions.
And you know,

120
00:06:49.191 --> 00:06:52.520
it's always funny to talk to an audience like this that understands the idea of

121
00:06:52.521 --> 00:06:54.830
using data to drive decisions.

122
00:06:54.831 --> 00:06:58.160
We do this and you do this across all the products that you have and news and

123
00:06:58.161 --> 00:06:59.420
entertainment and travel.

124
00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:02.930
But that just doesn't exist in healthcare because of the reasons,

125
00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:07.110
because of lack of data,
because of lack of,
of,
of an ecosystem.
That's,

126
00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:10.400
it's leveraging that information to help around decisions then,
and again,

127
00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:14.390
that has changed.
But if you look at other industries and um,

128
00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:15.920
it's funny again to bring this up to you,

129
00:07:15.921 --> 00:07:19.880
but of course the industries that have now been displaced by new companies of

130
00:07:19.881 --> 00:07:23.000
course are the ones that are thinking about how to better use data about

131
00:07:23.001 --> 00:07:27.440
individuals and collectively make better assessments to then provide better

132
00:07:27.441 --> 00:07:31.280
feedback and better decisions.
So super clear to you in this room,

133
00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:33.490
not necessarily super obvious to healthcare.

134
00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:37.070
And it's been really beating this drum for many years to understand how to,

135
00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:39.080
how to make this work in a healthcare setting.

136
00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:43.280
So one clear example of I can go onto my,
uh,

137
00:07:43.290 --> 00:07:45.350
my app on my phone and see the current temperature,

138
00:07:45.351 --> 00:07:48.710
see what the forecast looks like.
And that's done because you know,

139
00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:53.210
very clearly there are massive datasets being made available by organizations

140
00:07:53.211 --> 00:07:57.800
like Noaa,
uh,
that make large datasets available in real time via Api.

141
00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:01.400
If you start to think about,
you know,
why this doesn't exist in healthcare,

142
00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:03.630
it's super clear.
There is no underlying dataset.

143
00:08:03.710 --> 00:08:07.610
There's no API and there's no therefore no ecosystem of applications that lets

144
00:08:07.611 --> 00:08:11.480
you understand what's happening at the individual level or across populations.

145
00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:15.710
So we've been trying to solve for this issue for a number of years and in fact

146
00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:18.920
had been working with Google for many years to think about how to solve for
that.

147
00:08:19.370 --> 00:08:23.300
The first project that we did in this space with actually started well over 10

148
00:08:23.301 --> 00:08:26.350
years ago called health map.
And we had this idea that,
you know,

149
00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:27.900
just as Google mashups were,

150
00:08:27.910 --> 00:08:30.560
were becoming something that people were going turning to,

151
00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:34.370
why couldn't you go to a map and understand what was happening with the health

152
00:08:34.371 --> 00:08:37.490
of populations?
And specifically my background is in infectious disease.

153
00:08:37.491 --> 00:08:39.920
So why couldn't you go and see what outbreaks are happening,

154
00:08:39.921 --> 00:08:42.590
where the risks to populations who goes around the world.

155
00:08:43.070 --> 00:08:45.710
And in fact actually wrote an email to the,

156
00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:48.770
what was google.org at the time and said like,
listen,

157
00:08:48.950 --> 00:08:53.870
you can start to scrape the web and get insights just by mining news and social

158
00:08:53.871 --> 00:08:55.130
media and blogs and chat.

159
00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:58.710
All of a sudden now you can paint a picture in real time of what's happening

160
00:08:58.711 --> 00:09:02.610
around the world in ways that you couldn't.
If you just went to the WHO website,

161
00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:04.150
which may be posts,
you know,

162
00:09:05.250 --> 00:09:07.950
couple of dozen outbreaks a year on their website.

163
00:09:07.951 --> 00:09:12.450
It doesn't give you this comprehensive view of every disease event that a an

164
00:09:12.451 --> 00:09:16.290
individual might be worried about or a clinician should know about in in the

165
00:09:16.291 --> 00:09:19.530
care of a patient or actually a ministry of Health to understand what's

166
00:09:19.531 --> 00:09:23.820
happening even in their own country or maybe in adjacent bordering countries.

167
00:09:23.821 --> 00:09:28.170
So my first grant actually ever was actually out of google.org where we started

168
00:09:28.171 --> 00:09:32.730
building this technology to the point where now this is not only sort of an add

169
00:09:32.731 --> 00:09:34.440
on or something I think people think about,

170
00:09:34.441 --> 00:09:37.620
but it's core data now that's feeding many organizations,

171
00:09:37.621 --> 00:09:42.550
intelligence gathering operations ranging from CDC to who now we're in the non

172
00:09:42.551 --> 00:09:43.410
traditional data sets.

173
00:09:43.410 --> 00:09:47.490
Like how could you think about news or social media as being valuable healthcare

174
00:09:47.590 --> 00:09:48.480
Dataset?
Well,

175
00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:52.740
the first signs of h one n one if you guys remember swine flu didn't come from a

176
00:09:52.741 --> 00:09:55.560
report coming out of the Ministry of health or from CDC.

177
00:09:55.770 --> 00:09:59.190
It came out of a news site talking about a mysterious illness and Vera Cruz,

178
00:09:59.191 --> 00:10:03.150
Mexico about an a a town that had over 50% illness,

179
00:10:03.151 --> 00:10:07.560
a flu like symptoms.
That was the first sign of h one n one but more importantly,

180
00:10:07.561 --> 00:10:11.130
this idea that you could start mining the web for all these breadcrumbs of data.

181
00:10:11.470 --> 00:10:11.880
Um,

182
00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:15.330
both at the population and individual level meant that you could actually track

183
00:10:15.331 --> 00:10:17.880
a virus as it moved around the world in real time.

184
00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:20.160
And that's not something that ever been done before.

185
00:10:20.161 --> 00:10:24.840
Just based on the fact that you could just mind all this existing free data.

186
00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:28.170
Um,
this wasn't information that was held on by any particular government.

187
00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:32.190
This was data that was out there but just hadn't been processed,

188
00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:34.440
hadn't been tagged,
had,
you know,

189
00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:38.490
there was no NLP or machine learning tools to organize that content.

190
00:10:38.670 --> 00:10:41.520
Once you could do that and then all of a sudden now you have insights that were

191
00:10:41.521 --> 00:10:45.750
never made available for if you fast forward now just for instance the emergence

192
00:10:45.751 --> 00:10:47.910
of Ebola that happened in a few years ago.

193
00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:50.640
We have this idea now that there's actually,
you know,

194
00:10:50.641 --> 00:10:55.470
you could start mining even in resource poor settings from sources of physicians

195
00:10:55.471 --> 00:10:58.710
on the ground and are other organizations in a way that you could start to

196
00:10:58.711 --> 00:11:03.240
actually build realtime view at a local level of what was taking place with this

197
00:11:03.241 --> 00:11:05.760
really,
um,
you know,
massively important outbreak.

198
00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:09.990
But beyond that you can start to integrate other data sources.
So for instance,

199
00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:14.190
transportation network data.
So I want to layer in the movements of,
of,

200
00:11:14.310 --> 00:11:16.770
of individuals via passenger itinerary data.

201
00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:20.340
All of a sudden now you can look at the risk of introduction of,
of,
of,

202
00:11:20.341 --> 00:11:23.850
of this virus Ebola virus,
uh,
just by integrating that Dataset.

203
00:11:24.990 --> 00:11:26.760
Similarly with the emergence of Zika,

204
00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:29.930
people are familiar with that and seek emerged,
um,

205
00:11:30.090 --> 00:11:32.850
also across a huge geography.

206
00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:37.470
You can never tie any particular governments data to understanding that vast

207
00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:40.830
movement.
This is from the mining of all this underlying data,

208
00:11:40.831 --> 00:11:44.370
data from Twitter and other sources where people were confirming cases as they

209
00:11:44.371 --> 00:11:49.350
emerged.
So this concept of,
of mining and the mining,

210
00:11:49.351 --> 00:11:50.540
all this information is,
uh,

211
00:11:50.580 --> 00:11:55.060
has of course evolved over in initially started with this idea that you could

212
00:11:55.061 --> 00:11:57.610
just start a scrape the web and news and blog,

213
00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.990
but it became much more individual as sort of the advent of social media

214
00:12:01.991 --> 00:12:05.800
occurred.
The idea that what one likes on Facebook or what,

215
00:12:05.801 --> 00:12:09.120
when somebody tweets about,
uh,
someone searches about,
you know,

216
00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:13.660
that becomes much more valuable information than just say someone posting a news

217
00:12:13.661 --> 00:12:14.494
article.

218
00:12:14.620 --> 00:12:17.800
And so our view of this idea of this sort of digital exhaust was that if you

219
00:12:17.801 --> 00:12:22.510
could start to build algorithms that identified health related topics in these

220
00:12:22.511 --> 00:12:26.980
sites and then started doing that across multiple individuals of a sudden now

221
00:12:26.981 --> 00:12:30.370
you have not just,
you know,
mentions of events in a population,

222
00:12:30.580 --> 00:12:35.410
but you have actually insights to people's phenotypes as they interact with,

223
00:12:35.650 --> 00:12:39.970
with the web.
And I'll give you some examples from that.
Google flu trends,

224
00:12:39.971 --> 00:12:42.550
Paul Paul Mention Google flu trends.
We are,

225
00:12:42.580 --> 00:12:47.570
I was actually actively involved the initial concept and so there's,
you know,

226
00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:51.400
controversy around the,
the platform itself.

227
00:12:51.730 --> 00:12:54.100
But the reality is it was really transformational.

228
00:12:54.101 --> 00:12:56.380
It really opened people's eyes to the concept of,

229
00:12:56.620 --> 00:13:00.460
of a search query being something and a reflection of someone's health status.

230
00:13:00.790 --> 00:13:01.301
And yes,

231
00:13:01.301 --> 00:13:06.010
it had challenges because the models weren't being reevaluated over time as

232
00:13:06.011 --> 00:13:09.790
people search behaviors change.
But the concept is still incredibly valuable.

233
00:13:09.791 --> 00:13:14.050
And in fact it really created a whole new field of study in the use of search

234
00:13:14.051 --> 00:13:17.050
query data for purposes of health.
And there are many,

235
00:13:17.051 --> 00:13:20.080
many examples of how query data has,
has had an impact.

236
00:13:20.081 --> 00:13:23.230
And we're still working with Google right now.
This is work with Google dot.

237
00:13:23.380 --> 00:13:27.340
Google acts on some work around food borne illness post hurricane Harvey where

238
00:13:27.341 --> 00:13:31.210
we're using specific search terms around gastrointestinal disease to track where

239
00:13:31.211 --> 00:13:35.410
we might see the emergence of of outbreaks.
Of course following the hurricane,

240
00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:39.610
Google of course not being the only place where you can get digital phenotype

241
00:13:39.611 --> 00:13:40.480
data,
Yelp,

242
00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:44.740
you probably didn't know 10% of all Yelp reviews or food poisoning related.
Um,

243
00:13:44.741 --> 00:13:47.920
so we can start to scrape every Yelp review and start to get really interesting

244
00:13:47.921 --> 00:13:48.281
insights.

245
00:13:48.281 --> 00:13:52.270
This is from a particular area around San Francisco where we actually identified

246
00:13:52.271 --> 00:13:53.270
particular restaurants and,

247
00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:57.940
and in fact I'd started to identify ingredients that people were reflecting in

248
00:13:57.941 --> 00:14:00.880
their illness.
And we did this on a national scale of course.

249
00:14:00.881 --> 00:14:05.350
And then what we found was whereas people might think that consumer isn't smart

250
00:14:05.351 --> 00:14:09.220
enough to understand what's,
what's sort of driving their illness.
In fact,

251
00:14:09.330 --> 00:14:12.700
the ways in which in consumers talk about the ingredients actually reflects

252
00:14:12.701 --> 00:14:17.350
almost perfectly well with what CDC reflects in their sort of the source of

253
00:14:17.351 --> 00:14:18.730
every foodborne outbreak as well.

254
00:14:18.731 --> 00:14:22.450
So a lot of really incredible valuable information to the point where we

255
00:14:22.451 --> 00:14:23.860
actually worked with Twitter,
um,

256
00:14:24.070 --> 00:14:27.650
to start to mind anytime someone mentions diarrhea.
Um,

257
00:14:27.660 --> 00:14:30.940
and you might be surprised that millions of people tweet about their own

258
00:14:30.941 --> 00:14:35.560
diarrhea on Twitter every year.
And so we said,
okay,
well if that's,

259
00:14:35.590 --> 00:14:37.780
that's a source of data will will grab it.

260
00:14:37.781 --> 00:14:42.640
And so what we ended up doing was creating an auto sort of essentially a mining

261
00:14:42.641 --> 00:14:46.520
of anytime mentioned of a certain set of symptoms and then we have an auto

262
00:14:46.521 --> 00:14:48.310
response that allows,

263
00:14:48.370 --> 00:14:52.400
say a public health department to respond back to a consumer and then and get a

264
00:14:52.401 --> 00:14:56.380
customized survey to collect much more data.
And you know,

265
00:14:56.390 --> 00:15:00.560
our view of this is public health should be just similar to like United
Airlines.

266
00:15:00.561 --> 00:15:03.140
We're reflecting back,
someone has a complaint,

267
00:15:03.141 --> 00:15:05.000
public health can be reverted to respond to it.

268
00:15:05.001 --> 00:15:08.300
And so we've been building these tools for public health agencies to really get

269
00:15:08.301 --> 00:15:11.390
back in the game and we say putting the public back in public health,

270
00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:15.410
there are many other areas that you can start to think about.

271
00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:17.930
It's not just about infectious disease.
Um,
you know,

272
00:15:17.931 --> 00:15:22.760
Paul again mentioned the idea of the FDA.
Um,
and absolutely,
you know,

273
00:15:22.761 --> 00:15:27.320
when we think about the events that the FDA sees in terms of adverse drug
events,

274
00:15:27.590 --> 00:15:32.230
it's a very small window into what's actually going on with individuals with,
um,

275
00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:34.970
veteran experiencing issues with the medications that they're taking.

276
00:15:35.270 --> 00:15:38.240
We get a very,
very biased sample.
Of course,
these,

277
00:15:38.241 --> 00:15:41.600
most of it all comes from Pharma and life science companies,

278
00:15:41.900 --> 00:15:45.650
but we know that there's a much bigger opportunity understanding what's actually

279
00:15:45.651 --> 00:15:47.060
happening in the real world.

280
00:15:47.510 --> 00:15:51.080
And we also know that patients aren't obviously that super active.

281
00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:54.020
And even if they knew that their experiencing an adverse event,

282
00:15:54.230 --> 00:15:57.170
they don't remember or they don't think to report that to the physician and the

283
00:15:57.171 --> 00:16:01.220
physician knows about it,
they don't usually report it to the FDA.
So our view is,

284
00:16:01.221 --> 00:16:01.341
well,

285
00:16:01.341 --> 00:16:04.790
why not just go to where patients are already talking about these issues and

286
00:16:04.791 --> 00:16:06.710
think about how to amplify the voices.

287
00:16:06.711 --> 00:16:09.470
And so we built a VFD social media mining tool.

288
00:16:09.471 --> 00:16:13.040
This idea that we could start just going to,
to the patient voice directly,

289
00:16:13.310 --> 00:16:18.310
get insights about adverse drug events and start to provide important signals to

290
00:16:18.351 --> 00:16:22.250
both the FDA and to,
to Pharma companies.
So again,

291
00:16:22.280 --> 00:16:24.740
this is this idea of like how do you take a,

292
00:16:24.770 --> 00:16:28.160
the way people talk about their interactions with medications and make it

293
00:16:28.161 --> 00:16:31.280
valuable from an FDA and a regulatory perspective.

294
00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:35.840
So you have to identify a drug,
a reporter,
uh,
you know,
a patient,

295
00:16:36.220 --> 00:16:37.100
a,
a,

296
00:16:37.101 --> 00:16:40.760
an outcome and all of these things are actually identifiable even from something

297
00:16:40.761 --> 00:16:43.670
as short as a tweet or a Facebook post.
Um,

298
00:16:43.671 --> 00:16:47.420
and so all of that work can be done through the most challenging one of course,

299
00:16:47.421 --> 00:16:50.090
is how do you identify people's outcomes?
Uh,

300
00:16:50.091 --> 00:16:53.030
when there are many ways when people talk about the outcomes they experience

301
00:16:53.031 --> 00:16:55.460
online.
And there's a whole effort,

302
00:16:55.461 --> 00:16:59.450
and this is painstaking for years and years of work on the and human tagging

303
00:16:59.451 --> 00:17:03.410
side.
And we could debate whether this needs to be supervised,
cost,

304
00:17:03.411 --> 00:17:07.130
vacation or unsupervised.
We believe supervise does a much better job in the end,

305
00:17:07.131 --> 00:17:08.420
even though it's a huge amount of work.

306
00:17:08.660 --> 00:17:10.940
There's all sorts of things that we have to solve for typos,

307
00:17:10.941 --> 00:17:12.320
which are kind of obvious.

308
00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:16.400
But then the implied phrases like these are not things that are super obvious

309
00:17:16.430 --> 00:17:19.620
when you were starting to mine this,
but these have to be tagged.
Um,

310
00:17:19.820 --> 00:17:23.180
and then invented words and hashtags and all these other ways in which people

311
00:17:23.181 --> 00:17:26.480
talk on the Internet are not things that you would ever see in an electronic

312
00:17:26.481 --> 00:17:29.510
medical record.
So requires a whole new set of,

313
00:17:29.530 --> 00:17:33.800
of analysis and of course spelling variations and Canadians.
So we use the U.

314
00:17:34.190 --> 00:17:36.020
Um,
but you know,
again,

315
00:17:36.050 --> 00:17:40.160
the idea is that we start to organize all these mentions and then we started to

316
00:17:40.220 --> 00:17:44.210
combine them with more traditional classifications like snow,
Med and Metra.

317
00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:47.660
Now all of a sudden when we're processing things like social media posts,

318
00:17:47.661 --> 00:17:51.840
we have an ability to tag outcome and start to aggregate this across large

319
00:17:51.841 --> 00:17:52.674
categories.

320
00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:56.150
There are many other ways in which we can start to use these datasets,

321
00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:58.110
this digital phenotype data.
Um,

322
00:17:58.350 --> 00:18:01.680
we've done this a lot in the chronic disease space.
Um,

323
00:18:01.770 --> 00:18:05.460
sleep deprivation being one,
a big topic.
Um,

324
00:18:05.490 --> 00:18:07.530
when you go to your physician on an annual basis,

325
00:18:07.620 --> 00:18:09.600
they may ask you how you slew asleep.

326
00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:13.110
You're going to think about the past night and if you slept okay,

327
00:18:13.111 --> 00:18:15.060
then you just won't really talk about an issue.

328
00:18:15.270 --> 00:18:17.010
People won't really do a lot of sleep tracking,

329
00:18:17.011 --> 00:18:21.480
although there's some interesting products now on a,
out there on the market.

330
00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:23.820
But we thought to ourselves,
well,
why not just mine?

331
00:18:23.821 --> 00:18:25.950
When people talking about sleep issues online,

332
00:18:25.951 --> 00:18:27.720
and there's actually a huge amount of data,

333
00:18:27.721 --> 00:18:31.260
people just disclosing the fact that they've had a bad sleep or they can't
sleep.

334
00:18:31.770 --> 00:18:34.830
And what's amazing is you can start to track those individuals over time.

335
00:18:34.831 --> 00:18:36.450
So you know,
their online activity.

336
00:18:36.451 --> 00:18:40.800
You know how often they're on Twitter or on various social media sites.

337
00:18:40.801 --> 00:18:44.640
So you actually know the time points between interactions on social media.

338
00:18:44.641 --> 00:18:46.710
So you actually know if they got a good sleep or not.

339
00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:48.120
And then we can start to look,

340
00:18:48.121 --> 00:18:51.330
do case control studies where we look at individuals that are complaining about

341
00:18:51.331 --> 00:18:54.300
sleep matched to people that have,
have not mentioned sleep.

342
00:18:54.420 --> 00:18:57.450
And there's some really interesting findings that you start to get.
For instance,

343
00:18:57.451 --> 00:19:00.660
people that tend to complain about sleep,
have less followers,

344
00:19:00.661 --> 00:19:03.570
have much more negative mentions online.

345
00:19:03.571 --> 00:19:05.670
So all the psychosocial sort of attributes.

346
00:19:05.671 --> 00:19:09.210
Do you think about sleep deprivation all play out in the digital realm?
So again,

347
00:19:09.211 --> 00:19:11.460
this idea of the digital phenotype,

348
00:19:11.610 --> 00:19:16.250
sort of relating back to to what's people people are actually experiencing in

349
00:19:16.260 --> 00:19:17.093
the real world.

350
00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:22.020
We're spending a lot of time thinking about crowdsourcing and ways in which we

351
00:19:22.021 --> 00:19:23.690
directly engage people.
Um,

352
00:19:24.180 --> 00:19:28.140
there's advantages to thinking about how to sort of create participatory

353
00:19:28.141 --> 00:19:28.980
surveillance systems.

354
00:19:28.981 --> 00:19:32.550
So it's not this idea of just scraping people's underlying data,

355
00:19:32.580 --> 00:19:36.600
but how do you actively engage people directly in,
in surveillance projects?

356
00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:40.230
And I know there's been some really exciting work with fairly and the baseline

357
00:19:40.231 --> 00:19:43.710
project.
And so this is maybe a more of a surveillance effort,

358
00:19:43.711 --> 00:19:47.850
but it's similar in the sense of if you could start to build an incredible sort

359
00:19:47.851 --> 00:19:49.920
of cohort of individuals reporting information,

360
00:19:49.921 --> 00:19:52.860
you can get insights that would be very challenging otherwise.

361
00:19:52.861 --> 00:19:57.861
And so this was actually also a initially funded out of Google flu near you.

362
00:19:58.110 --> 00:19:59.490
This idea that um,

363
00:19:59.550 --> 00:20:03.000
we could start asking directly people how they're feeling and if we can get

364
00:20:03.030 --> 00:20:04.980
insights about sentence people are experiencing,

365
00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:08.730
we can combine those symptoms to understand flew in the population because

366
00:20:08.731 --> 00:20:11.370
there's a specific definition a for flu.

367
00:20:11.550 --> 00:20:14.670
And so what's amazing is just building a system like this,

368
00:20:14.671 --> 00:20:18.750
you can get 100,000 people just reporting on a weekly basis telling us how

369
00:20:18.751 --> 00:20:21.060
they're feeling,
how their family members are feeling.

370
00:20:21.061 --> 00:20:23.040
And there are also their vaccination status.

371
00:20:23.490 --> 00:20:26.580
And so at that point you get some really interesting insights.

372
00:20:26.610 --> 00:20:29.580
You can understand flew in the population or at the national scale,

373
00:20:29.850 --> 00:20:32.380
which is all well and good,
but you can get other data sets,

374
00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:36.900
you can understand sort of the demographic and age distributions and she very

375
00:20:36.930 --> 00:20:40.980
granular geographic data.
And more importantly you can get vaccination status.

376
00:20:40.981 --> 00:20:44.790
So you have an understanding of efficacy of the vaccine very early on in the

377
00:20:44.790 --> 00:20:47.560
season.
And running a system like this really is,

378
00:20:47.620 --> 00:20:52.210
is fractional compared to what it takes to run a true surveillance system at the

379
00:20:52.211 --> 00:20:56.440
CDC where you're engaging with physician offices and laboratory facilities.

380
00:20:56.770 --> 00:20:57.603
This is all,
you know,

381
00:20:57.610 --> 00:21:01.000
very inexpensive and the amount of data you get is pretty incredible.

382
00:21:01.001 --> 00:21:04.720
And the other side of it is that the individuals are being educated about the

383
00:21:04.721 --> 00:21:05.950
importance of immunization.

384
00:21:06.010 --> 00:21:09.520
And so you sort of have also the secondary benefit of tools like this,

385
00:21:09.521 --> 00:21:11.650
which they represented public health education.

386
00:21:13.370 --> 00:21:15.980
So we're thinking about how do you start to extend that because it's very hard

387
00:21:15.981 --> 00:21:20.981
to get people engaged in a crowdsourcing tool to get PT people engage on a

388
00:21:21.651 --> 00:21:24.500
weekly basis,
even if only takes a few seconds.

389
00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:27.710
So we've been building tools at a of Boston children's to think about,

390
00:21:27.711 --> 00:21:31.010
well what do people really want?
Well,
when I,
uh,
you know,

391
00:21:31.100 --> 00:21:35.750
have a one or 3.4,
I don't really know what that means.
I have a set of symptoms.

392
00:21:36.020 --> 00:21:38.970
What should I do?
Should I,
you know,
race into urgent care?
Should I go to the Ed?

393
00:21:38.971 --> 00:21:41.960
Should I self treat?
But we have all these guidelines,

394
00:21:41.961 --> 00:21:45.740
but they're in binders across the hospital and people when they come to the Ed,

395
00:21:45.741 --> 00:21:47.240
there's some guidelines that exist,

396
00:21:47.241 --> 00:21:50.690
but people don't have those guidelines easily available to them on the web.

397
00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:54.260
They may go to web MD where there's no sort of decision support that's

398
00:21:54.261 --> 00:21:56.030
customized to you as an individual.

399
00:21:56.180 --> 00:21:59.630
There's very sort of generalized guidelines that probably all end up in cancer

400
00:21:59.631 --> 00:22:02.110
anyways.
And so you want to think about,
you know,

401
00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:05.390
where there'd be opportunities to customize this kind of information.

402
00:22:05.391 --> 00:22:08.930
We built this tool that allows parents and,
and,
and,

403
00:22:09.270 --> 00:22:13.130
and individuals to understand what to do next,
what dosing they need to do.

404
00:22:13.460 --> 00:22:16.410
But again,
in the and the backend,
we're collecting all this incredible,

405
00:22:16.411 --> 00:22:19.970
get granular geographic data about health status that can help feed our

406
00:22:19.971 --> 00:22:24.550
surveillance of,
of influenza
by extension.

407
00:22:24.551 --> 00:22:26.680
Then we have these decision support tools.

408
00:22:26.681 --> 00:22:31.681
These can then connect via API to a whole new sort of ecosystem of technologies

409
00:22:31.841 --> 00:22:35.100
that are out there in the connected device space.
And you know,
my biases,

410
00:22:35.410 --> 00:22:37.090
the influenza and infectious disease wrong.

411
00:22:37.091 --> 00:22:40.420
But you can think about this in many other domains and connected devices where

412
00:22:40.750 --> 00:22:45.130
you have a fitbit or any other device that you get some form of metric out of.

413
00:22:45.131 --> 00:22:49.450
But there's not a lot of context to what that means in a clinical setting.

414
00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:53.370
And so with a connected thermometer,
what we've done,
and this is one,
uh,

415
00:22:53.410 --> 00:22:58.330
out of weddings,
um,
that essentially are now a Nokia,
I think.

416
00:22:58.450 --> 00:23:01.920
Um,
but the idea is that you,
you take,
uh,
uh,
uh,

417
00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:05.950
temperature and then that feeds you into their app that is connected via Api to

418
00:23:05.980 --> 00:23:07.270
Thermia,
which is our tool.

419
00:23:07.450 --> 00:23:10.510
And then you go through decision support that then tells a parent what to do

420
00:23:10.511 --> 00:23:13.270
with their child,
with the certain set of conditions that they have.

421
00:23:13.271 --> 00:23:17.110
So all of a sudden now it's a much more sort of personalized view to back to

422
00:23:17.111 --> 00:23:21.640
that individual.
And we've been doing this across the whole sort of,
uh,
you know,

423
00:23:21.641 --> 00:23:24.880
plot form of,
of applications and temperature sensing,

424
00:23:24.910 --> 00:23:26.110
one off temperature sensing,

425
00:23:26.111 --> 00:23:29.410
continuous temperature sensing tools that all of a sudden becomes incredible

426
00:23:29.411 --> 00:23:31.510
data back into the system.
But again,

427
00:23:31.511 --> 00:23:36.140
provides better information back to the individual.
And you know,

428
00:23:36.170 --> 00:23:38.210
there's no,
you know,
it's always on one hand,

429
00:23:38.211 --> 00:23:40.970
good to talk to this audience about sort of next generation technologies.

430
00:23:40.971 --> 00:23:42.490
On the other hand,
you know,
I,

431
00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:46.490
I need to be careful cause you I'm sure know a lot more than I do in this space,

432
00:23:46.820 --> 00:23:49.550
but we've been thinking about all the new technologies and uh,
and,

433
00:23:49.730 --> 00:23:52.130
and tools that are going to be out there for the consumer going forward.

434
00:23:52.131 --> 00:23:56.660
And it's important for us to stay on top of it as a healthcare system and trying

435
00:23:56.661 --> 00:23:59.060
to understand better ways to interact with patients,

436
00:23:59.061 --> 00:24:02.390
better ways to collect data about outcomes.
And so of course,

437
00:24:02.450 --> 00:24:06.380
all the new conversational interfaces that are emerging are ones that we think

438
00:24:06.381 --> 00:24:10.670
are going to be playing incredible roles in interaction with patients.

439
00:24:10.700 --> 00:24:13.970
It could be of course,
uh,
in ways in which it's more administrative.

440
00:24:13.971 --> 00:24:17.040
Like how do I book an appointment,
uh,
with,
uh,

441
00:24:17.570 --> 00:24:21.170
with my health care provider?
Or it could be much more educational.

442
00:24:21.171 --> 00:24:23.990
Like I'm experiencing these set of things,
what do I do next?

443
00:24:24.380 --> 00:24:27.500
And so we've been thinking about it and we've built some tools in house.

444
00:24:27.501 --> 00:24:28.370
We've also partnered,

445
00:24:28.371 --> 00:24:32.000
this is a company that spun out actually a out of Harvard medical school and

446
00:24:32.001 --> 00:24:33.440
that I personally have been part of,

447
00:24:33.441 --> 00:24:35.820
but also children's as a part of this is buoy.

448
00:24:35.830 --> 00:24:37.630
There's several other companies in this space and this,

449
00:24:37.631 --> 00:24:42.250
this idea of taking underlying medical knowledge,
pulling it together in a,

450
00:24:42.251 --> 00:24:46.640
in a way that you have now a conversational interface that were the questions,

451
00:24:46.690 --> 00:24:50.870
uh,
that come are not predetermined there based on your previous responses.

452
00:24:50.871 --> 00:24:55.280
And the idea is that you get some sort of response back as an individual what to

453
00:24:55.281 --> 00:24:58.430
do next.
So you're not interacting with an individual,

454
00:24:58.431 --> 00:25:00.350
it's just purely a chat bot online.

455
00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:04.600
But what we've seen when we've started to do this at children's is that there's

456
00:25:04.610 --> 00:25:08.210
incredible value to be gained from it already in very early stages.

457
00:25:08.210 --> 00:25:12.080
These algorithms show incredible diagnostic and triage,
accuracy,
triage,

458
00:25:12.081 --> 00:25:14.690
accuracy being the most important for us.

459
00:25:14.691 --> 00:25:19.550
We get inundated in the emergency department with acute conditions that probably

460
00:25:19.551 --> 00:25:20.840
could have been cheated at home.

461
00:25:20.841 --> 00:25:25.640
And so these AI based tools at the frontline can be incredibly valuable and

462
00:25:25.641 --> 00:25:30.050
helping divert people to the,
to the right care,
whether it's stay at home,

463
00:25:30.051 --> 00:25:34.500
go to urgent care or ed,
wait to call your physician again.
Now we have these,

464
00:25:34.501 --> 00:25:38.000
these sort of first level tools that can help especially,
you know,

465
00:25:38.150 --> 00:25:41.060
in in locations with a w that are resource poor.

466
00:25:41.450 --> 00:25:43.910
Paul mentioned a voice and yes,
you know,

467
00:25:44.030 --> 00:25:48.260
there's probably diverging opinions here about is it,
is it a gimmick?

468
00:25:48.290 --> 00:25:50.990
Is that really going to be transformational?

469
00:25:51.170 --> 00:25:54.800
At least at Boston children's we've been really thinking that voice is going to

470
00:25:54.801 --> 00:25:57.440
be sort of the next wave of the Internet.
Whereas you know,

471
00:25:57.441 --> 00:26:01.040
patient portals where 20 years ago and we're thinking mobile apps,
you know,

472
00:26:01.041 --> 00:26:03.290
we've been developing those for for a number of years.

473
00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:06.860
The idea that VoiceBase tools are going to play an important role in healthcare

474
00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:09.170
is one that we're spending a lot of time thinking about.

475
00:26:09.530 --> 00:26:13.940
There's all the data that's out there about how voice searches are going to be

476
00:26:13.941 --> 00:26:17.810
ubiquitous.
That's a smart speakers are really already out there.
I mean,

477
00:26:17.811 --> 00:26:22.190
we're not talking 10 years out,
you know,
many,
many households now,

478
00:26:22.250 --> 00:26:25.340
a huge proportion of them have these listening devices in the home.

479
00:26:25.341 --> 00:26:27.470
And so our perspective has been,
well,

480
00:26:27.650 --> 00:26:30.830
if you have a device that's continuously listening and I know there's going to

481
00:26:30.831 --> 00:26:34.310
be varying opinions about how valuable these things are,

482
00:26:34.550 --> 00:26:36.800
it should be armed with the medical knowledge.

483
00:26:36.801 --> 00:26:41.000
There's no reason why you can't ask questions that relate to your health care

484
00:26:41.001 --> 00:26:42.920
personally or in general questions.

485
00:26:43.380 --> 00:26:47.310
And so we've been experimenting with this pretty broadly at the hospital,

486
00:26:47.311 --> 00:26:51.240
thinking about the applications in the home applications within the hospital and

487
00:26:51.241 --> 00:26:54.780
then of course in the outpatient setting and just give you a few examples.

488
00:26:55.530 --> 00:26:58.770
The idea is that of course in the home there's all ways that you can ask about,

489
00:26:58.800 --> 00:26:59.670
you know,
we,
we,

490
00:26:59.730 --> 00:27:02.520
we've been thinking about how to ask about symptoms and other things,

491
00:27:02.730 --> 00:27:06.360
but why not access your medical records or other types of information are,

492
00:27:06.361 --> 00:27:06.631
of course,

493
00:27:06.631 --> 00:27:09.570
people were thinking about this in terms of medication reminders and other types

494
00:27:09.571 --> 00:27:13.800
of,
of tracking tools.
Um,
in the inpatient setting,
of course,

495
00:27:13.801 --> 00:27:16.620
there's all sorts of ways in which we're actually already experimenting with

496
00:27:16.621 --> 00:27:20.120
this and the hospital.
So the idea that a physician who needs to be hands free,

497
00:27:20.121 --> 00:27:22.440
you can access all the medical knowledge of protocols,

498
00:27:22.441 --> 00:27:25.440
the ability to page people,
huge amount of,

499
00:27:25.550 --> 00:27:29.310
of things that need to be done in a fast paced environment that were voices have

500
00:27:29.311 --> 00:27:32.070
we prime for and then the outpatient setting.

501
00:27:32.100 --> 00:27:35.430
And this is one I think we're probably as the most conversation that's taking

502
00:27:35.431 --> 00:27:40.410
place.
Why not have sort of a digital enabled listening device as part of the

503
00:27:40.411 --> 00:27:43.950
interaction that a physician has with their patient that brings all that

504
00:27:43.951 --> 00:27:44.940
conversation together,

505
00:27:45.150 --> 00:27:48.810
codes it up and then of course brings it into the electronic medical record,

506
00:27:49.110 --> 00:27:51.810
improves the interaction with the physician and the patient,

507
00:27:51.990 --> 00:27:53.400
but at the same time,
you know,

508
00:27:53.401 --> 00:27:56.460
is able to reduce a huge amount of the workload that our physicians are

509
00:27:56.461 --> 00:28:00.510
experiencing,
which is pretty unbelievable at this point.
And you know,

510
00:28:00.540 --> 00:28:02.820
we're not the only ones thinking about it.
We've actually been,

511
00:28:02.870 --> 00:28:06.370
we just published a paper thinking about all the broad landscape of VoiceBase

512
00:28:06.371 --> 00:28:10.080
tools.
Um,
there is an incredible array of technologies,

513
00:28:10.081 --> 00:28:12.090
people thinking about this in the aging space.

514
00:28:12.091 --> 00:28:14.910
People thinking about this in the dictation space,
many,

515
00:28:14.911 --> 00:28:16.680
many different different domains.

516
00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:20.370
We're actually running a whole voice healthcare summit in October.

517
00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:22.140
If people want to come join that.

518
00:28:22.410 --> 00:28:25.790
We have been working with Amazon now for several years.
Uh,

519
00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:30.180
we built the first healthcare skill for Amazon Alexa called kids MD.
Um,

520
00:28:30.210 --> 00:28:32.910
and essentially that's about just collectively putting together all the

521
00:28:32.911 --> 00:28:36.480
questions that parents have to ask about their kids.
It's very early days,

522
00:28:36.510 --> 00:28:37.830
it's improving over time,

523
00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:41.610
but it was this sort of this use case like how do you start to use Alexa and the

524
00:28:41.611 --> 00:28:45.510
way that it can arm it with information that's valuable to parents,
it's pretty,

525
00:28:45.570 --> 00:28:48.240
pretty straightforward in the sense that how the skill works and how it

526
00:28:48.241 --> 00:28:50.970
interfaces back with our,
uh,
underlying system.

527
00:28:50.971 --> 00:28:54.930
We have a number of different tools around fever and asthma and,
and other,
uh,

528
00:28:54.931 --> 00:28:57.810
other products.
I think the holy Grail,

529
00:28:57.840 --> 00:29:00.930
and this is where I don't have a lot of data,
is more just a lot of interests.

530
00:29:00.930 --> 00:29:03.870
So throwing this out there in case anybody wants to work on this project,

531
00:29:03.970 --> 00:29:06.930
there is a huge amount of opportunity I think in the biomarker space.

532
00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:11.940
I think that,
um,
if we can get over the concerns around what this means is,

533
00:29:11.970 --> 00:29:14.700
uh,
you know,
from a privacy perspective,
um,

534
00:29:14.730 --> 00:29:18.750
the idea that your volume and rhythm and on tone and all these various features

535
00:29:18.751 --> 00:29:21.780
of your interaction with the smart speaker,
if that can be collected,

536
00:29:21.781 --> 00:29:24.360
those have really important insights that can be gained.

537
00:29:24.361 --> 00:29:28.230
Just sort of how search query data was incredibly revolutionary and still now

538
00:29:28.231 --> 00:29:30.210
paying dividends in terms of research.

539
00:29:30.211 --> 00:29:34.410
And I think the same goes for voice in the sense that there are many,

540
00:29:34.411 --> 00:29:37.950
and this is already published data.
This is not just my,
uh,
my,

541
00:29:37.990 --> 00:29:39.280
my prediction there.

542
00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:42.760
There've been published studies and all of these different domains where voice

543
00:29:42.761 --> 00:29:46.840
is actually contributing some insight and early detection to many different

544
00:29:46.900 --> 00:29:49.780
diseases in many different domains.
So anyway,

545
00:29:49.810 --> 00:29:52.060
just throwing that out there in case anybody's interested in collaboration.

546
00:29:52.990 --> 00:29:55.590
The last thing I'll talk about is on the healthcare delivery side and,
and,

547
00:29:55.670 --> 00:29:59.710
and sort of the last phase of where I think consumer technology plays a role.

548
00:29:59.980 --> 00:30:02.440
We actually launched a product called health.
The health map.

549
00:30:02.441 --> 00:30:05.810
Vaccine Finder are just maybe a couple of years after the,

550
00:30:05.820 --> 00:30:08.170
the swine flu outbreak.
And in fact,

551
00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:10.630
this is another example of us taking a product from Google.

552
00:30:10.631 --> 00:30:13.120
I think now that it's happened three times.
Um,

553
00:30:13.270 --> 00:30:16.870
so Google launched a product which is a vaccine finder tool to help people

554
00:30:16.871 --> 00:30:20.590
identify what vaccines to get and specifically where they can get the h one n

555
00:30:20.591 --> 00:30:22.180
one flu shot.
After the pandemic.

556
00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:25.780
We ended up taking over the product and expanding it across a range of different

557
00:30:25.781 --> 00:30:30.781
vaccines and built a tool that essentially has now every Walgreens and cvs and

558
00:30:31.990 --> 00:30:36.820
Walmart and,
and mom and pop pharmacy where we have their supply information,

559
00:30:36.821 --> 00:30:38.350
their pricing location,

560
00:30:38.351 --> 00:30:42.310
all the data that an individual needs to make a decision on what vaccine to get

561
00:30:42.311 --> 00:30:46.230
and where despite that being super,
um,

562
00:30:46.540 --> 00:30:49.410
we think convenient.
You can't walk a block without getting,
um,

563
00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:52.630
sort of an ad for a free flu shot,
it's still challenging.

564
00:30:52.631 --> 00:30:54.250
So then we thought to ourselves,
well,

565
00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:58.630
consumers are experiencing all this incredible value out of the on demand world,

566
00:30:58.850 --> 00:31:02.680
um,
with Uber and Lyft and like,
why aren't patients seeing the same thing?

567
00:31:02.681 --> 00:31:04.180
And so the,
our view of it,
I was like,
okay,

568
00:31:04.181 --> 00:31:07.240
well why not start to think about flipping the script and getting these things

569
00:31:07.241 --> 00:31:08.320
to the individual?
And yes,

570
00:31:08.530 --> 00:31:12.070
now everybody talks about reification of health care and there are a lot of good

571
00:31:12.071 --> 00:31:15.910
examples of that.
Um,
at the time I couldn't get Uber's attention on this,

572
00:31:15.911 --> 00:31:18.130
but I actually wrote a complaint,
uh,

573
00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:20.650
well I wrote in the box where you complain about your ride,

574
00:31:20.830 --> 00:31:23.620
but instead of a complaint,
it was like,
ride was fine,

575
00:31:23.621 --> 00:31:25.870
but maybe you should think about health care.
Um,

576
00:31:25.900 --> 00:31:28.390
and somehow someone on the other end red,
they're like,
okay.

577
00:31:28.390 --> 00:31:33.250
And then they came to visit us and we pushed them on this idea of flu shots.
Um,

578
00:31:33.280 --> 00:31:35.620
and we got,
we convinced them.
And you know,

579
00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:39.250
I know you people here understand how typical legal is.

580
00:31:39.251 --> 00:31:42.470
So just think about maybe even worse,
I don't know.
But anyways,

581
00:31:42.490 --> 00:31:44.260
just getting legal to,

582
00:31:44.280 --> 00:31:48.400
to agree to putting a button on the Uber App though was about bringing needles

583
00:31:48.401 --> 00:31:52.150
to people.
Um,
wasn't like necessarily the easiest thing to convince them to do.

584
00:31:52.151 --> 00:31:54.190
But we did.
And we've done this for several years now.

585
00:31:54.191 --> 00:31:56.910
We're putting nurses nuber vehicles and essentially you,

586
00:31:56.980 --> 00:31:59.410
you request a vaccine on demand.

587
00:32:00.100 --> 00:32:03.100
And it was pretty cool cause we were able to collect a lot of survey data and

588
00:32:03.101 --> 00:32:07.300
show that people's decision to get a vaccine was heavily influenced by the fact

589
00:32:07.301 --> 00:32:11.500
that it was on demand.
Uh,
that on demand was in a part of their decision.

590
00:32:11.650 --> 00:32:14.680
And in fact,
many people never got a flu shot before,

591
00:32:14.681 --> 00:32:18.310
but because it was that convenient,
they did it.
And so of course,
you know,

592
00:32:18.311 --> 00:32:20.320
we're thinking about this broadly now.
Uh,

593
00:32:20.350 --> 00:32:22.270
now it's been several years since we did this.

594
00:32:22.300 --> 00:32:26.680
There are many companies that are thinking about logistics in health care.
Um,

595
00:32:26.770 --> 00:32:29.940
you know,
of course it got mentioned Amazon and space to,
um,

596
00:32:29.980 --> 00:32:33.040
we actually built a company out of children's as well called circulation,

597
00:32:33.041 --> 00:32:37.270
which essentially sat sits between Lyft and Uber and health systems to help

598
00:32:37.271 --> 00:32:41.960
manage logistics.
So the,
is that it's essentially an exchange platform where,

599
00:32:42.530 --> 00:32:44.140
you know,
our view is that patients can,

600
00:32:44.150 --> 00:32:48.200
should experience the same level of benefit as consumers do and round on demand.

601
00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:51.500
But the current status quo for patients who can't afford transportation,

602
00:32:51.501 --> 00:32:52.520
as they wait hours,

603
00:32:52.730 --> 00:32:55.160
they have really inefficient ways of getting to their appointments.

604
00:32:55.160 --> 00:32:58.940
This is all covered by Medicaid and they're insurers.
So we essentially took,

605
00:32:58.941 --> 00:33:02.400
brought on demand and broad into the patient patient realm.

606
00:33:02.401 --> 00:33:06.080
And what we've seen is really incredible in that there is,
um,

607
00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:09.320
real huge amount of uptake and um,
health systems.

608
00:33:09.321 --> 00:33:13.190
We're dying for a better way to help move their patients to their appointments,

609
00:33:13.191 --> 00:33:16.000
but also how healthcare systems move there.

610
00:33:16.270 --> 00:33:20.030
They're caregivers out to patients help her on product logistics or many other

611
00:33:20.031 --> 00:33:23.810
ways in which sort of odd,
there are inefficiencies in the health system.

612
00:33:23.811 --> 00:33:27.740
And so in our view,
there's this whole,
if you start to pull it all together,
um,

613
00:33:27.770 --> 00:33:29.150
you know,
if you have this,

614
00:33:29.151 --> 00:33:32.420
these constant listening devices in the home that interact with you and then

615
00:33:32.421 --> 00:33:36.150
provide you guidance that all you know is great and that's your interface with

616
00:33:36.151 --> 00:33:39.440
the health system and all of a sudden you bring in the logistics side and now

617
00:33:39.441 --> 00:33:41.010
you've got the full,
complete circle.

618
00:33:41.040 --> 00:33:43.820
Not only can you complete a visit and get insight,

619
00:33:43.850 --> 00:33:46.640
but now you can get your prescription delivered to you and get even your home

620
00:33:46.641 --> 00:33:50.270
care.
So there's a whole new world that's emerging just from the existing,

621
00:33:50.600 --> 00:33:52.220
you know,
nothing incredibly innovative,

622
00:33:52.221 --> 00:33:56.720
just existing tools that are out there right now.
Lots of challenges.
I mean,

623
00:33:56.870 --> 00:34:00.200
we can talk about this as part of this discussion.
Uh,
you know,

624
00:34:00.201 --> 00:34:02.570
we still struggle with this.
I mean,
I'm,

625
00:34:02.660 --> 00:34:06.260
I've benefited by having a great collaboration with Google and others over the

626
00:34:06.260 --> 00:34:10.000
years,
but of course that is highly variable for health systems.
Um,
it,
Bill,

627
00:34:10.250 --> 00:34:12.950
I think there's Google cloud people here,
you know,
the storage ideas,
you know,

628
00:34:12.951 --> 00:34:15.230
that still represents a real challenge.

629
00:34:15.530 --> 00:34:18.710
And this is again is like a very sort of new field of study,

630
00:34:18.950 --> 00:34:21.200
the digital phenotype.
How do you start to process that data?

631
00:34:21.201 --> 00:34:25.100
How do you start to integrate that information with other sets of data?

632
00:34:25.370 --> 00:34:27.710
It's all super early.
So we're having a lot of fun.

633
00:34:27.711 --> 00:34:31.460
There were kids in a ketchup because there's so much in amazing data insights to

634
00:34:31.461 --> 00:34:33.110
be gained.
Um,
but again,

635
00:34:33.111 --> 00:34:36.200
how do you start taking all that insight and data and making it valuable from

636
00:34:36.201 --> 00:34:39.980
the perspective of clinical care is still,
I think a little bit of a road ahead.

637
00:34:39.981 --> 00:34:43.730
So I'll leave it there and maybe we'll have some discussion.
Thank you so much.

638
00:34:50.160 --> 00:34:51.600
<v 1>But John,
that was great.
Uh,</v>

639
00:34:51.601 --> 00:34:54.780
so encourage people to come up to the microphones to ask questions,

640
00:34:54.781 --> 00:34:58.680
but I'll start off with one.
Um,
I think when you're very,
very close to this,

641
00:34:58.681 --> 00:35:02.310
you can see the tremendous power of being able to gather this kind of

642
00:35:02.311 --> 00:35:05.820
information that is outside the traditional sphere.
I mean,

643
00:35:05.821 --> 00:35:09.300
we knew that most people don't spend their lives going to hospitals and clinics,

644
00:35:09.330 --> 00:35:13.800
right?
So how can we understand what's happening,
uh,
in their normal life?

645
00:35:14.310 --> 00:35:18.240
But when I have these conversations with people who aren't as close with,

646
00:35:18.450 --> 00:35:22.260
they legitimately come back with like,
wow,
that sounds super creepy,
Paul.
Um,

647
00:35:22.950 --> 00:35:27.840
any thoughts on how we sort of address this notion of there's some benefit that

648
00:35:27.841 --> 00:35:31.740
this can be deeply unnerving and second in your own experience when Boston

649
00:35:31.741 --> 00:35:32.470
children's,

650
00:35:32.470 --> 00:35:35.820
like have you guys thought about how you sort of bring that information?

651
00:35:35.821 --> 00:35:39.870
Then we often think about information or personalized medicine being really

652
00:35:39.871 --> 00:35:42.420
about genetic information or epigenetic information,

653
00:35:42.810 --> 00:35:44.970
but this is a different type of personalized information.

654
00:35:44.971 --> 00:35:49.140
Where is there a mechanism that I could contribute,
you know,

655
00:35:49.320 --> 00:35:52.380
information about my behavior or my social media activity,

656
00:35:52.381 --> 00:35:57.240
may my physical activity back to my healthcare provider fascinated.

657
00:35:57.270 --> 00:36:00.210
Since you're on the vanguard of this,
if you have any thoughts.
Yeah,

658
00:36:00.370 --> 00:36:02.530
<v 2>these are all questions that we get a lot of,
you know,</v>

659
00:36:02.531 --> 00:36:05.880
in terms of the acceptance of people that is,
you know,

660
00:36:06.220 --> 00:36:07.470
when you've talked to the company,

661
00:36:07.490 --> 00:36:09.730
is there maybe a high level people are thinking that's going to be,

662
00:36:09.731 --> 00:36:12.820
you're getting a huge amount of pushback generally.
You know,

663
00:36:12.821 --> 00:36:17.080
we've done huge amounts of surveys and capture data and generally people are

664
00:36:17.230 --> 00:36:21.160
very excited if the data's being used for their own personal good or to be maybe

665
00:36:21.640 --> 00:36:22.473
for social good.

666
00:36:22.630 --> 00:36:26.770
We've had a lot of success and and almost actually I can't remember an instance

667
00:36:26.771 --> 00:36:28.600
of any amount of pushback.

668
00:36:28.930 --> 00:36:33.730
Of course the best policy is around patient consent.
So it sort of,

669
00:36:33.731 --> 00:36:36.880
to answer your second question,
there's a lot of thirst around contributing my,

670
00:36:36.930 --> 00:36:41.470
my activity data back into my system and that very easily comes with a

671
00:36:41.471 --> 00:36:44.410
consenting or the data we're gonna collect via Alexa.

672
00:36:44.410 --> 00:36:47.830
That again would be a consent issue.
Right?
So I think we can already solve,

673
00:36:47.890 --> 00:36:52.120
even if there wasn't a concern to begin with,
we can start to solve it with,

674
00:36:52.340 --> 00:36:56.740
with education and really explain to people,
you know,
what they're contributing.

675
00:36:56.741 --> 00:37:01.150
And they have the opportunity opt out of these,
uh,
of these kind of assessments.

676
00:37:01.480 --> 00:37:04.300
We're definitely spending a lot of time thinking about how to bring that data

677
00:37:04.301 --> 00:37:08.110
into the Emr because again,
you know,
these data are siloed.

678
00:37:08.470 --> 00:37:12.210
It's still a challenge like frankly getting the EMR vendors to,

679
00:37:12.240 --> 00:37:14.740
to think about this data.
It's always sort of part of the roadmap,

680
00:37:14.860 --> 00:37:19.150
but it's not sort of clearly,
um,
you know,
a big priority.

681
00:37:19.151 --> 00:37:21.520
So we're having to build our own applications.
We,
you know,

682
00:37:21.521 --> 00:37:24.730
of course I've been working with you for many years about using new data

683
00:37:24.731 --> 00:37:27.820
standards to ingest information and build new visualization tools,

684
00:37:28.090 --> 00:37:30.040
but it's still kind of clunky and not,

685
00:37:30.060 --> 00:37:34.690
not optimize for real clinical use just yet.
Yeah.

686
00:37:35.550 --> 00:37:39.730
<v 5>Can you describe the fact that consumers have generally responded?</v>

687
00:37:39.731 --> 00:37:41.860
The question you're saying,
if this is useful to me,

688
00:37:41.861 --> 00:37:45.130
I'm okay with sharing certain amounts of misinformation.
Um,

689
00:37:45.520 --> 00:37:48.190
our sense from the part of the business that we work in with health care

690
00:37:48.191 --> 00:37:52.000
providers is that many times the providers are so conservative,

691
00:37:52.001 --> 00:37:54.940
they are afraid to experiment in this area.

692
00:37:55.090 --> 00:37:58.510
How do you help them develop a sense of urgency around that?
We,

693
00:37:58.580 --> 00:38:02.460
<v 2>we definitely have a huge variation in our,
um,</v>

694
00:38:02.790 --> 00:38:05.970
physician pool around these technologies and datasets.
I mean,

695
00:38:06.660 --> 00:38:11.190
when they're incredibly valuable and they create efficiencies,
um,
that's great.

696
00:38:11.191 --> 00:38:11.491
Right?
Like,

697
00:38:11.491 --> 00:38:16.350
so some of these datasets mean that that can reduce the number of physical

698
00:38:16.380 --> 00:38:18.540
visits they needed to have with a patient,
right?

699
00:38:18.541 --> 00:38:21.920
So it reduces the amount of effort over time.
That clearly is a,
when,

700
00:38:21.930 --> 00:38:25.680
I mean we're spending,
and this is not exactly like the digital phenotype data,

701
00:38:25.710 --> 00:38:26.071
but you know,

702
00:38:26.071 --> 00:38:29.550
we're spending a lot of time implementing things like online virtual visits.

703
00:38:29.551 --> 00:38:33.450
The idea that you can do like a of a virtual interaction with your physician

704
00:38:33.451 --> 00:38:38.170
that cuts costs,
cuts time,
there's more efficiency when physicians see that it's,

705
00:38:38.230 --> 00:38:42.760
it's a no brainer and I think that starts to outweigh the concerns of,
you know,

706
00:38:42.770 --> 00:38:47.260
how,
how valuable that interaction was versus an in person.
Um,
you know,

707
00:38:47.261 --> 00:38:48.790
that's sort of what we do.
But I think we have,

708
00:38:48.850 --> 00:38:51.310
we definitely have a huge variation in an excepted.

709
00:38:51.440 --> 00:38:51.840
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

710
00:38:51.840 --> 00:38:56.840
So follow up on that one then of what you talked about was clinically oriented.

711
00:38:57.080 --> 00:38:57.390
Yeah,

712
00:38:57.390 --> 00:39:00.480
I think there are enormous opportunities from a business perspective in terms of

713
00:39:00.481 --> 00:39:03.660
how data is used and measured and analyzed.

714
00:39:03.900 --> 00:39:05.490
Do you get involved at all?

715
00:39:05.670 --> 00:39:09.540
Do you and your team get involved more on the or at all of the business side

716
00:39:09.600 --> 00:39:13.040
around things like a appointment scheduling,
uh,
uh,

717
00:39:13.530 --> 00:39:14.790
telemedicine and things like that.

718
00:39:14.850 --> 00:39:19.020
<v 2>So our team is,
um,
focus a digital across the institution.</v>

719
00:39:19.050 --> 00:39:21.660
So those could be things like right clinical,

720
00:39:21.690 --> 00:39:24.480
like say building a precision medicine service for the hospital,

721
00:39:24.660 --> 00:39:28.260
but it could be just as easily like building virtual visit,
um,

722
00:39:28.680 --> 00:39:33.300
or online second opinion program or building our patient portal.
Um,

723
00:39:33.330 --> 00:39:37.620
so all that sort of in more admitted or appointment scheduling,
Doctor Finding,

724
00:39:37.621 --> 00:39:38.730
you know,
all those things are,

725
00:39:38.731 --> 00:39:41.280
are sort of part of the mandate of our innovation group.

726
00:39:41.630 --> 00:39:44.930
<v 5>Okay.
Last one.
Are you running a business in the children's hospital,</v>

727
00:39:44.960 --> 00:39:46.580
would you say and are you,

728
00:39:46.760 --> 00:39:51.760
how do you think about contributing to the business success of BCH in

729
00:39:52.281 --> 00:39:52.900
particular?

730
00:39:52.900 --> 00:39:56.120
<v 2>Yeah,
absolutely.
I mean,
there's been significant investment.
Um,</v>

731
00:39:56.140 --> 00:39:59.740
obviously I've got all my research,
I'd research grant funding,

732
00:39:59.741 --> 00:40:01.270
but on the business side of the hospital,

733
00:40:01.271 --> 00:40:06.220
absolutely there's a recognition that digital is going to bring costs down.

734
00:40:06.250 --> 00:40:06.881
Right?
So,

735
00:40:06.881 --> 00:40:10.690
and then there's also recognition that it's a must do from a patient experience

736
00:40:10.691 --> 00:40:13.990
perspective.
Uh,
but then there's also a business side as well.

737
00:40:14.020 --> 00:40:17.980
The Ip that we're generating and working together with companies has potential

738
00:40:17.981 --> 00:40:18.980
value.
Uh,

739
00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:22.540
we also run an accelerator where we're actually spinning off companies from the

740
00:40:22.541 --> 00:40:25.570
come from researchers and clinicians identifying really important,

741
00:40:25.720 --> 00:40:27.310
and I didn't have time to go into this in the talk.

742
00:40:27.311 --> 00:40:30.370
There's a whole other version of this talk that is really about the accelerator

743
00:40:30.371 --> 00:40:33.010
and all the various companies that were forming out of the hospital.

744
00:40:33.011 --> 00:40:36.370
And that's a whole,
you know,
there's a business as well as mission case,
uh,

745
00:40:36.371 --> 00:40:37.150
to doing that.

746
00:40:37.150 --> 00:40:41.830
We have incredible data assets that also represents a business opportunity as

747
00:40:41.831 --> 00:40:45.160
well.
So,
you know,
both in terms of us,
you know,

748
00:40:45.220 --> 00:40:48.160
identifying opportunities to build things as well as partnering with outside

749
00:40:48.161 --> 00:40:52.750
organizations to help sort of create some sort of funding back to support these

750
00:40:52.751 --> 00:40:53.584
efforts.

751
00:40:53.930 --> 00:40:58.490
<v 6>You offered up a bunch of amazing examples of kind of infectious disease and</v>

752
00:40:58.491 --> 00:40:59.390
using big data.

753
00:41:00.830 --> 00:41:03.860
I'm wondering if you can talk a little bit about heart disease,

754
00:41:03.950 --> 00:41:08.950
which continues to be the number one killer in anything that you're working with

755
00:41:09.981 --> 00:41:12.110
around heart disease and indicators.

756
00:41:12.111 --> 00:41:15.590
It's particularly fresh in my mind is we just launched Google fit,

757
00:41:16.520 --> 00:41:19.280
which is tracking steps as well as this new,

758
00:41:19.310 --> 00:41:24.310
I think it's called heart points metric around and accelerated heartbeats et

759
00:41:24.620 --> 00:41:27.050
cetera.
I'm so interested in kind of what you're,

760
00:41:27.110 --> 00:41:31.170
<v 2>there's a project in the space that,
I actually can't talk about it now,
but um,</v>

761
00:41:31.250 --> 00:41:34.730
generally I would say that hasn't a top top priority for us cause I'm in a

762
00:41:34.731 --> 00:41:35.960
pediatric hospital.

763
00:41:36.110 --> 00:41:40.610
Heart disease isn't always the right cause we're talking about lifestyle
factors,

764
00:41:40.940 --> 00:41:42.200
but I think more generally,

765
00:41:42.201 --> 00:41:45.010
I mean the idea that we can start to bring in tools that are,

766
00:41:45.070 --> 00:41:48.760
are tracking sort of levels of activity and logging of,

767
00:41:48.800 --> 00:41:50.840
I mean those things all relate,
right?

768
00:41:50.841 --> 00:41:54.740
So we're building tools within our patient population that are sort of allowing

769
00:41:54.741 --> 00:41:58.790
us to,
to,
to sort of catalog,
you know,
food and,
and other things.

770
00:41:58.940 --> 00:42:02.240
I mean they're slightly differences,
of course it wouldn't,

771
00:42:02.241 --> 00:42:06.680
things you want to track with with the child,
but they overlap as well.

772
00:42:06.950 --> 00:42:08.960
Um,
but,
um,
yeah,
I'm trying to think.

773
00:42:08.961 --> 00:42:12.680
I mean it's very different than an infectious disease disclosure.
I mean,

774
00:42:12.681 --> 00:42:16.580
we've done things around social media where we've looked at heart attacks

775
00:42:16.640 --> 00:42:20.660
related to people's disclosures of particular drugs that they've taken.

776
00:42:20.661 --> 00:42:23.480
Like that was a big one for us.
We've done this in,
in,

777
00:42:23.490 --> 00:42:26.970
in Twitter as an example where we looked at people's,
uh,
uh,

778
00:42:27.110 --> 00:42:30.980
medication use and then we looked at outcomes where people reported having heart

779
00:42:30.981 --> 00:42:34.460
attacks and we looked at associations and we've done this both in social media

780
00:42:34.461 --> 00:42:39.380
data and clinical data sets where there's huge opportunities.
But,
um,
yeah,

781
00:42:39.830 --> 00:42:43.310
I think,
but I'll have a study very soon to talk about it in this space as well.

782
00:42:43.390 --> 00:42:44.223
Thanks.
Thanks,

783
00:42:45.750 --> 00:42:47.940
<v 6>John.
Thank you for your talk.
It was really great.
Uh,</v>

784
00:42:47.941 --> 00:42:51.210
you touched on this a couple times about the workload that doctors undergo.
Yeah.

785
00:42:51.240 --> 00:42:53.730
Um,
I know that doctor burnout has been on the rise,

786
00:42:53.731 --> 00:42:57.840
I think 45% to 55% last that I saw.
How do you,

787
00:42:57.870 --> 00:43:01.170
does your team look at like the workload of data collection the doctors have to

788
00:43:01.171 --> 00:43:02.210
do,
sitting there typing,

789
00:43:02.230 --> 00:43:05.520
filling out medical records where you see the future of that?

790
00:43:05.700 --> 00:43:06.001
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

791
00:43:06.001 --> 00:43:09.260
I mean I think there's some really interesting companies start startups in this

792
00:43:09.261 --> 00:43:10.260
space.
Um,

793
00:43:10.350 --> 00:43:13.740
obviously I'm sure that there's some groups here that are working on that and

794
00:43:13.741 --> 00:43:15.300
we've catalog this and we,
you know,

795
00:43:15.301 --> 00:43:19.530
we do shadowing to understand sort of where the inefficiencies are and that data

796
00:43:19.590 --> 00:43:21.530
side of it is really,
um,

797
00:43:21.630 --> 00:43:25.230
becoming such a big part of the activities that a physician has to do,
which,

798
00:43:25.520 --> 00:43:29.010
you know,
so again,
like we see it,
it's the number one complaint.

799
00:43:29.310 --> 00:43:31.110
Burnout is the biggest topic.

800
00:43:31.111 --> 00:43:35.340
It's one of our top priorities and the digital group now to solve.
Um,
you know,

801
00:43:35.910 --> 00:43:39.810
I spoke about voice at the end and I think that again is where I do believe that

802
00:43:39.811 --> 00:43:44.100
there's some real opportunity in the capturing of that interaction and,

803
00:43:44.130 --> 00:43:45.990
and parsing of that.
Um,

804
00:43:46.350 --> 00:43:49.800
I think obviously the tools have to get a lot better.
I mean,

805
00:43:49.860 --> 00:43:54.160
nuance an example of a company.
So we implemented dragon.
If you're improving,

806
00:43:54.161 --> 00:43:56.400
know if that software is just,
you know,
dictation tool,

807
00:43:56.910 --> 00:43:58.860
we've seen tremendous uptake of that.

808
00:43:58.861 --> 00:44:01.980
There's so much excitement about it and it has reduced workload.

809
00:44:02.220 --> 00:44:03.750
And so now the next step is,
okay,

810
00:44:03.751 --> 00:44:07.080
well what do we do with technology that can be sort of listening to the full

811
00:44:07.081 --> 00:44:08.900
interaction that sort of,
you know,

812
00:44:08.940 --> 00:44:12.540
go from a digital scribe to fully automated way of capturing.

813
00:44:12.570 --> 00:44:16.170
I think that in my mind is,
is where there's a lot of excitement.

814
00:44:16.800 --> 00:44:21.030
The other part of it is just purely around the Emr.
And I mean again,

815
00:44:21.031 --> 00:44:23.460
I think this is where Google is super well positioned.

816
00:44:23.461 --> 00:44:26.100
If you wanted to take that leap,
I don't know if that's ever going to happen,

817
00:44:26.101 --> 00:44:28.370
but to build actually an Emr,
um,

818
00:44:28.500 --> 00:44:31.950
the current ways in which the Emr is built is obviously on billing.

819
00:44:32.340 --> 00:44:33.510
I'm not focused,

820
00:44:33.570 --> 00:44:38.460
not really any Ui sensibility and I think that really is a big frustration.

821
00:44:38.461 --> 00:44:39.540
So there's voice,

822
00:44:39.541 --> 00:44:43.410
but I think just generally thinking about the user interface at that physicians

823
00:44:43.411 --> 00:44:46.680
work with and where we actually have a project right now with verily that is

824
00:44:46.681 --> 00:44:50.310
trying to focus on trying to extract information and reduce the amount of work

825
00:44:50.311 --> 00:44:53.850
that a physician has to do to think about this sort of hit and medical history

826
00:44:53.851 --> 00:44:56.930
of the,
of an individual.
So hopefully we'll get to present that at some point.

827
00:44:57.660 --> 00:45:01.260
<v 7>Thank you.
Thanks.
I had a question about the digital phenotyping.</v>

828
00:45:01.261 --> 00:45:03.120
I thought that was just a really interesting,

829
00:45:03.121 --> 00:45:08.121
in terms of its applicability to understanding how to motivate patients,

830
00:45:08.910 --> 00:45:11.850
particularly motivating children and teenagers.
I think that's,

831
00:45:11.880 --> 00:45:13.200
that's particularly challenging.

832
00:45:13.201 --> 00:45:16.800
So to what degree do you think you have insights on the phenotyping side into

833
00:45:16.801 --> 00:45:20.520
how we deliver our care in a way that engages those pages?

834
00:45:20.550 --> 00:45:23.670
And as a sub question to that also,

835
00:45:24.150 --> 00:45:25.830
particularly I Linda mental health space,

836
00:45:25.940 --> 00:45:26.571
<v 2>right?
No,</v>

837
00:45:26.571 --> 00:45:29.990
I mean I think that there is been a lot of work really interesting startups in

838
00:45:29.991 --> 00:45:32.210
the space and have thought about how to take,

839
00:45:32.211 --> 00:45:36.360
collect that data on the backend and understand important changes.
Right.

840
00:45:36.361 --> 00:45:40.070
It changes in sentiment and changes in the ways that people are interacting with

841
00:45:40.071 --> 00:45:43.850
technology to create some form of learning.
And I do think,
um,

842
00:45:43.910 --> 00:45:45.560
well we haven't done that ourselves.

843
00:45:45.561 --> 00:45:49.550
There's some great opportunities around automatic feedback loops that they go

844
00:45:49.551 --> 00:45:53.360
back to patients around sort of,
you know,
questions.
So you,

845
00:45:53.810 --> 00:45:57.200
the algorithm detects a real change in behavior and that goes back to the

846
00:45:57.201 --> 00:46:00.950
individual and,
and sort of as a series of questions to get a little bit deeper.

847
00:46:01.370 --> 00:46:04.340
Um,
and I do think that there's opportunities to do this off of the existing

848
00:46:04.341 --> 00:46:06.230
platform.
So you mentioned teenagers.

849
00:46:06.231 --> 00:46:10.910
I mean this is where working with existing platforms becomes where I've focused

850
00:46:10.911 --> 00:46:15.110
a lot of my attention rather than I'm trying to build your own new social media

851
00:46:15.111 --> 00:46:19.100
tool for teens with mental health issues,
which really has challenges.
I mean,

852
00:46:19.101 --> 00:46:20.390
people have tried these things,

853
00:46:20.780 --> 00:46:23.750
but that's where like I think there's an opportunity for working with a company

854
00:46:23.760 --> 00:46:27.590
like snapchat as an example.
Like why couldn't we have some form of,

855
00:46:27.950 --> 00:46:31.220
of mechanism within those companies to work?
And then that becomes challenging,

856
00:46:31.221 --> 00:46:35.660
right?
Like how,
like I've never as a researcher had an ability to do reach back.

857
00:46:35.661 --> 00:46:39.260
Like I've been able to collect a lot of raw data and get insights,
but that loop,

858
00:46:39.320 --> 00:46:42.440
I think that's where this group here is much more well positioned to try and

859
00:46:42.441 --> 00:46:46.250
experiment with things that,
you know,
the usual research or just doesn't have.

860
00:46:46.340 --> 00:46:50.180
Do you have any game of vacation experience?
Um,
not so much.
I mean,

861
00:46:50.360 --> 00:46:52.170
I'm sort of on the fence on the,

862
00:46:52.230 --> 00:46:55.020
and when we'd done a little bit with our flu project,
um,

863
00:46:55.120 --> 00:46:58.270
with trying to keep people in the system points for,
you know,

864
00:46:58.310 --> 00:47:00.740
the amount of reporting people getting flu badges and things.

865
00:47:00.741 --> 00:47:03.470
I think they worked to a certain extent,
but,
um,

866
00:47:03.650 --> 00:47:05.600
I haven't found them to be incredibly valuable.

867
00:47:05.601 --> 00:47:08.150
I think there's been sort of over gamification in some ways.

868
00:47:08.151 --> 00:47:12.140
We could have these tools,
but um,
we have,
we haven't spent a lot of time on that.

869
00:47:13.190 --> 00:47:14.780
<v 1>Well,
thank you so much,
John,
uh,</v>

870
00:47:14.960 --> 00:47:19.490
very much appreciate the sort of glimpse into the future and I'd like to thank

871
00:47:19.491 --> 00:47:22.060
John for coming in.
Great.
Thanks so much.

872
00:47:24.580 --> 00:47:24.880
<v 4>Okay.</v>
