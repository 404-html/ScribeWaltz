1
00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:10.980
Technology and jobs has been in the news recently.

2
00:00:10.981 --> 00:00:14.280
You may have noticed manufacturing jobs for instance,

3
00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:19.840
there's been a huge decline in manufacturing as a share of employment,

4
00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:24.210
uh,
technology in my view.

5
00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.750
And I think the view of most economists is the main factor for that.

6
00:00:27.751 --> 00:00:32.751
So this chart shows the decline in cotton textile manufacturing from 1940,

7
00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.510
uh,

8
00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:40.510
about over 70% of that is due to technology since 2000.

9
00:00:42.511 --> 00:00:46.200
It's true trade has played a much more dominant role,
uh,

10
00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.630
as terrorists,
terrorists and,

11
00:00:48.631 --> 00:00:52.560
and the restraints on trade have been relaxed.
Uh,

12
00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.870
but technology is the big story.

13
00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:01.060
We also have new technologies coming on that are going to accelerate this

14
00:01:01.061 --> 00:01:03.910
process.
Machine learning,
artificial intelligence technologies.

15
00:01:03.911 --> 00:01:08.911
One study a few years ago came out and said that 44 47% of the total us

16
00:01:09.611 --> 00:01:14.611
employment is potentially automateable over perhaps the next decade or two.

17
00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:21.010
My book goes back and looks at Tech Tech,
the technology of the past.

18
00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:22.330
Um,

19
00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:26.290
and some people are very dismissive about anything having to do with history and

20
00:01:26.291 --> 00:01:29.560
technology.
Uh,
I think I'll paraphrase canes,

21
00:01:29.561 --> 00:01:33.740
which says that people who ignore history,
uh,

22
00:01:33.741 --> 00:01:38.110
are slaves to a defunct economist.
Um,

23
00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:40.481
the aim of,

24
00:01:40.481 --> 00:01:45.340
of history here is not to dismiss the current challenges is not to say,
oh,

25
00:01:45.341 --> 00:01:48.250
it all worked out in the past.
It's going to work out just fine.
Don't you worry.

26
00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:52.510
No,
it's to understand them.
We can.
And the only way we can understand,
uh,
the,

27
00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.550
the nature of how technology impacts societies to see what it's done so far.

28
00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:59.980
Not that it's going to necessarily be the same,

29
00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:02.020
but that's how we know what questions to ask.

30
00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.770
<v 1>Okay.</v>

31
00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:08.000
<v 0>I'm going to in fact argue that the idea of the end of work in the near future,</v>

32
00:02:08.001 --> 00:02:11.000
the next 10 or 20 years isn't really the,
the main challenge.

33
00:02:11.001 --> 00:02:16.001
The main challenge is generating the skills to work with a new technology.

34
00:02:16.731 --> 00:02:21.410
I know on a social scale.
So it's,
it's scarce skills,
not scarce jobs.

35
00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.320
And this is important,
uh,

36
00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.720
because we have to understand what the real problem is that we're going to

37
00:02:26.721 --> 00:02:30.050
understand what kind of policies you want to put in place to fix it.
If we,

38
00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.300
we address the wrong problem.
If for instance,

39
00:02:32.301 --> 00:02:36.860
we raise tariffs because we think it's trade that has destroyed most of the

40
00:02:36.861 --> 00:02:38.390
jobs.
Uh,
we're not,

41
00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.270
we may make things worse and we're not going to solve the real problem.

42
00:02:41.271 --> 00:02:44.450
And I think the same thing is true with the end of work arguments.

43
00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:49.110
So let me start with,
with a bit of history.
Um,

44
00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:54.760
first I'm going to make a point from history that automation in fact can create

45
00:02:55.731 --> 00:03:00.310
jobs and often does,
uh,
automation is nothing new.

46
00:03:00.311 --> 00:03:03.400
So going back to those,
the textile industry,

47
00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:08.970
this is a picture of the we've room of a textile mill and fall river,

48
00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:10.361
fall river,

49
00:03:10.361 --> 00:03:14.950
Massachusetts from about 1910 over a hundred years ago.

50
00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:16.930
And if you look closely,

51
00:03:16.931 --> 00:03:21.670
you'll see that there are very many machines and very few workers already.

52
00:03:21.671 --> 00:03:22.690
Over a hundred years ago,

53
00:03:22.691 --> 00:03:26.870
we had a very high level of automation and this was nothing new.
I,

54
00:03:26.871 --> 00:03:31.510
the best mills at that time would have 24 looms per weaver.
Um,

55
00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:33.750
so,
and in fact,
if you look at,

56
00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:38.020
at the course of automation over the 19th century,

57
00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:41.560
uh,
compare,
uh,
what,
uh,

58
00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:46.570
somebody could do what a weaver could do in the B at the beginning of the

59
00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:50.110
century on a handloom,
excuse me,

60
00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:53.620
98% of the,
uh,

61
00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:57.280
of the work was automated by,
by 1910.

62
00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:01.580
Very few,
only some of the task,

63
00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:04.450
very few of the tests we remained for workers to do

64
00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:09.370
that.
In fact,
that didn't create massive unemployment.

65
00:04:09.371 --> 00:04:13.780
It didn't create 90 eliminate 98% of the jobs.
In fact,

66
00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:18.790
if I show you the full chart,
uh,
of the,
of the initial charge,

67
00:04:18.791 --> 00:04:19.624
you'll see that

68
00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:26.190
throughout the 19th century job's jobs rose rapidly in the cotton textile

69
00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:30.850
industry.
All the while this,
this heavy automation was going on.

70
00:04:30.851 --> 00:04:35.140
All the while machines were taking over work from humans,
but nevertheless,

71
00:04:35.141 --> 00:04:39.370
employment increased.
So there's a real,
there's a real question here.

72
00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:42.360
Why is it that sometimes,
uh,

73
00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:46.270
tech not automation can increase jobs and other times it eliminates them.

74
00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:52.630
Um,
I can clearly go both ways and,
and the answer is,
uh,

75
00:04:52.631 --> 00:04:56.150
it has to do with consumer demand.
So for first,

76
00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:00.730
first ignore the chart at the beginning of the 19th century that a typical

77
00:05:00.731 --> 00:05:05.440
person might have one set of clothes.
They had very little cloth,

78
00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:08.150
otherwise Clark was extremely expensive.
Uh,

79
00:05:08.151 --> 00:05:12.190
much of it was made at home in the household.
It was extremely tedious to do.

80
00:05:12.191 --> 00:05:15.460
It took a lot of time.
Uh,
so people had very little of it.

81
00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:20.760
When automation came in and started reducing the amount of labor required to

82
00:05:21.281 --> 00:05:22.650
produce a yard of cloth,

83
00:05:22.651 --> 00:05:25.930
it don't meant that the price went down because there's competition and when the

84
00:05:25.931 --> 00:05:26.591
price went down,

85
00:05:26.591 --> 00:05:31.090
people responded by buying quite a bit more cloth because now they could get a

86
00:05:31.091 --> 00:05:35.590
second pair of clothes.
And as,
as it became progressively cheaper,

87
00:05:35.591 --> 00:05:38.870
they could start using cloth and other things.
They could put up draperies and,

88
00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:40.770
and upholster furniture.
Um,

89
00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:44.170
but finally you get to the 20th century,

90
00:05:44.171 --> 00:05:49.171
the middle of the 20th century and cloth is cheap and a further price reduction

91
00:05:49.391 --> 00:05:52.750
just isn't going to provoke a lot of people to go out.

92
00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:54.660
And buy a whole lot more cloth.
You know,

93
00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:59.700
you have a very strong response to price changes in the early years when

94
00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:05.420
productivity is very low.
But when demand is largely saturated,

95
00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:08.840
you have a very small response.
And that's the difference because what,

96
00:06:08.841 --> 00:06:12.320
so what happens is in the early years,
demand increases.

97
00:06:12.321 --> 00:06:13.880
A lot of people buy a lot more cloth.

98
00:06:13.881 --> 00:06:17.840
They buy so much more that even though less labor is needed to produce a yard of

99
00:06:17.841 --> 00:06:21.250
cloth,
there are that many more yards of cloth produced that the,

100
00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:22.550
that the workforce goes up.

101
00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:27.370
But since 1920 or 1940,
uh,

102
00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:32.380
the reverse is true that when you drop the price of a cloth by making it more

103
00:06:34.281 --> 00:06:37.010
efficient to produce people buy a little bit more,

104
00:06:37.011 --> 00:06:40.940
but not enough to offset the job losses.
And that's why you see this,

105
00:06:40.941 --> 00:06:45.320
this inverted u pattern.
And that's why automation doesn't always,

106
00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:49.340
uh,
decrease employment.
It can increase it.

107
00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:55.430
What about today?
We're seeing lots of new technologies coming on.

108
00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:59.060
Are they increasing?
Are they decreasing work?
Well,
we can look at some examples.

109
00:06:59.061 --> 00:07:04.061
So we had barcode scanners come into grocery stores and retail outlets in the

110
00:07:04.281 --> 00:07:08.390
1980s and actually there were more cashiers employed even though it tucked cut

111
00:07:08.391 --> 00:07:09.320
down on their labor.

112
00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:14.360
We have ecommerce coming in so far it's meant more salespeople,
uh,

113
00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:17.810
electronic discovery of legal documents.
Uh,

114
00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:22.250
computers are doing a great job at,

115
00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:25.970
at sifting through massive amounts of legal documents,

116
00:07:25.971 --> 00:07:28.880
but in fact what's happened is demand is increased so that now there are that

117
00:07:28.881 --> 00:07:32.690
many more legal documents that are going undergoing discovery and we're seeing

118
00:07:32.691 --> 00:07:36.230
more paralegals being employed.
Uh,
my,

119
00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:39.830
one of my favorite examples is the ATM and the bank teller.
Uh,

120
00:07:39.831 --> 00:07:42.170
we had from 1995 to 2005,

121
00:07:42.171 --> 00:07:46.400
just a huge increase in the number of ATM is deployed by US banks.

122
00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:48.350
But in fact,

123
00:07:48.351 --> 00:07:52.370
the number of bank tellers went up and went up actually faster than the labor

124
00:07:52.371 --> 00:07:55.460
force in general.
What happened?
Well,

125
00:07:55.461 --> 00:07:59.600
they only needed 13 tellers operator branch instead of 21 and made it cheaper to

126
00:07:59.601 --> 00:08:02.360
operate a branch.
And so what is it the banks do?

127
00:08:02.361 --> 00:08:04.220
They opened up a lot more branches.

128
00:08:04.221 --> 00:08:07.640
They increased demand and so many more branches that in fact the number of

129
00:08:07.641 --> 00:08:09.790
tellers went up.
Uh,

130
00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:15.520
it's not uniformly true that every bit of come new computer technology,

131
00:08:16.671 --> 00:08:19.670
information technology increases jobs.

132
00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:23.920
If you look across sectors,
manufacturing,
uh,

133
00:08:23.930 --> 00:08:26.080
is associated with a decrease in,

134
00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:30.830
in jobs with information from an associated with information technology.

135
00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:34.100
Um,
that goes along with what we've seen.

136
00:08:34.101 --> 00:08:39.101
Early manufacturing has undergone 200 years of progressive automation and so

137
00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:41.660
demand is relatively saturated,

138
00:08:41.810 --> 00:08:46.710
but in lots of other areas we're seeing demands that haven't been touched.
We're,

139
00:08:46.711 --> 00:08:48.080
we're seeing,
uh,

140
00:08:48.140 --> 00:08:51.620
information technology being used for all sorts of new applications and things

141
00:08:51.621 --> 00:08:54.590
that haven't been done before.
Things that haven't been automated before.

142
00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:59.100
And so we were seeing a typically a more positive response.

143
00:08:59.101 --> 00:09:03.820
So that in fact that overall the story is that information technology is in

144
00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:07.800
industries or an occupations is associated with the job growth,

145
00:09:07.801 --> 00:09:09.090
not job declines.

146
00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:17.240
Saturated demand.
Yes.
It's not all a positive story though.

147
00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:19.640
So there are winners and losers.

148
00:09:20.850 --> 00:09:21.270
<v 1>Okay.</v>

149
00:09:21.270 --> 00:09:26.230
<v 0>Uh,
these are typesetters from the New York Times in 1940.
So,</v>

150
00:09:26.770 --> 00:09:30.880
uh,
publications back then were these,
these people sat there on these machines,

151
00:09:30.881 --> 00:09:33.850
which,
which spit out slugs have led with the,

152
00:09:33.910 --> 00:09:37.120
with the inverse of the,
uh,

153
00:09:37.450 --> 00:09:41.590
the type words of have a line of type those that they are called Lionel type

154
00:09:41.591 --> 00:09:46.420
machines.
Um,
and those little slug,
those metal slugs were assembled and,
and the,

155
00:09:46.421 --> 00:09:50.200
and that formed the basis for printing pages of a newspaper or a book.

156
00:09:51.190 --> 00:09:55.810
Uh,
we saw computers come along and desktop publishing,
electronic publishing,

157
00:09:56.020 --> 00:10:00.820
and the number of type setters just plummeted from 80,000 to 20,000 in a decade.

158
00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:03.440
<v 1>Okay.</v>

159
00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:07.250
<v 0>But lots of those jobs were essentially taken over by graphic designers or</v>

160
00:10:07.251 --> 00:10:10.670
desktop publishers,
people working at computers.
Now,
uh,

161
00:10:10.671 --> 00:10:13.130
we're doing that same work plus more.

162
00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:16.820
They could assemble the pages and redesign them and tweak them in various ways.

163
00:10:16.821 --> 00:10:21.500
So the,
the computer software made things much more powerful,

164
00:10:21.501 --> 00:10:24.620
much more flexible.
Uh,
it made it much easier to make revisions.

165
00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:27.590
So there was a substitution of one occupation for another,

166
00:10:27.770 --> 00:10:31.580
and what you have is a decline in the number of jobs for type setters,

167
00:10:31.850 --> 00:10:35.270
but an even greater increase in the number of jobs for graphic designers.

168
00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:39.230
So one,
one change offset another,

169
00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:43.880
the net change is still positive,
but they're definitely winners and losers.

170
00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:48.890
And if you happen to be someone who was in a blue collar type setting occupation

171
00:10:48.891 --> 00:10:50.540
and gone through an apprenticeship program,

172
00:10:51.110 --> 00:10:55.100
you have to get a new set of skills if you want to remain employed.

173
00:10:56.420 --> 00:11:00.830
And so that's really where the problem comes in.
We've,
let's go back again to,
to,

174
00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:04.490
to,
to the challenge of skills that came up in the past.
This is Lowell,

175
00:11:04.491 --> 00:11:07.310
Massachusetts on the Merrimack River.
Uh,

176
00:11:07.730 --> 00:11:12.260
the Merrimack river valley was sort of the silicon valley of the 19th century,

177
00:11:12.261 --> 00:11:17.210
early 19th century industrial revolution in the u s uh,
the mills.

178
00:11:17.211 --> 00:11:20.360
They're recruited a young farm,

179
00:11:20.361 --> 00:11:24.440
girls from all over northern New England to come in to live in boarding houses

180
00:11:24.441 --> 00:11:29.030
and work these new new fangled automated machines.

181
00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:34.910
Uh,
one girl who entered this is Lucy Larkin.
I'm a girl who,

182
00:11:34.911 --> 00:11:39.490
she has a girl at 12.
She entered the mills and uh,
1830,
18,

183
00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:42.680
40,
[inaudible],
early 1840s.
Um,

184
00:11:43.550 --> 00:11:48.350
while she was in the mill,
she studied German.

185
00:11:48.620 --> 00:11:50.120
She took classes in botany.

186
00:11:50.121 --> 00:11:54.550
She heard lectures by John Quincy Adams and Ralph Waldo Emerson,

187
00:11:54.790 --> 00:11:57.040
the mill girls put out of a magazine.

188
00:11:57.041 --> 00:12:00.780
There were multiple magazines they put out and she published poetry in,

189
00:12:00.870 --> 00:12:05.170
in one of them and became a known by two John Greenleaf Whittier,

190
00:12:05.171 --> 00:12:09.610
who became a mentor and friend.
She compared in her later life,

191
00:12:09.611 --> 00:12:13.970
she compare working in the mills in those days to going to college.
Uh,

192
00:12:14.050 --> 00:12:19.050
and it was very much designed by the mill owners to be a culturally and

193
00:12:19.241 --> 00:12:24.241
intellectually enriching experience in order to attract the most talented

194
00:12:24.731 --> 00:12:26.530
people.
Um,

195
00:12:27.370 --> 00:12:30.660
we tend to think of factory workers as being unskilled and,

196
00:12:30.661 --> 00:12:32.530
and that's not really right.
Uh,

197
00:12:32.531 --> 00:12:35.950
these people who were skilled but they didn't learn in a classroom,

198
00:12:35.951 --> 00:12:39.370
they learned on the job.
They experience learning by doing.

199
00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:43.030
So there were all these new things required of the new technology that people

200
00:12:43.031 --> 00:12:46.060
needed to know how to build it.
They needed it to know how to install it,

201
00:12:46.061 --> 00:12:49.240
to operate it,
how to maintain it,
how to organize production.

202
00:12:49.241 --> 00:12:53.230
Had a market all along the way for every job involve the war,

203
00:12:53.350 --> 00:12:56.770
a whole new set of things to be learned.
And for a number of reasons,

204
00:12:56.771 --> 00:13:01.490
they couldn't be learned in school.
They had to be learned on the job.
Uh,

205
00:13:01.510 --> 00:13:05.000
this shows what's called a learning curve.
Uh,

206
00:13:05.050 --> 00:13:08.920
the productivity of a group of weavers,

207
00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:11.140
the number of months they had worked on the job.

208
00:13:11.141 --> 00:13:13.780
And what'd you can see is that when they started working,

209
00:13:14.050 --> 00:13:17.680
they were not very productive and they doubled or tripled or quadrupled their

210
00:13:17.681 --> 00:13:22.330
productivity over the space of a year.
So people became more productive.

211
00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:26.740
That represents a very substantial investment in skills.

212
00:13:27.370 --> 00:13:30.730
And it was learning those skills on the job that was critical.

213
00:13:30.850 --> 00:13:34.660
And that was the reason in order to acquire people who,

214
00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:37.200
who could co who could learn those skills.
Well,
they,

215
00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:40.900
the mills sought to recruit the best and the brightest.

216
00:13:43.060 --> 00:13:44.950
On the other hand,
they learn new skills,

217
00:13:44.951 --> 00:13:48.770
but it took them a long time before they got better wages.
Uh,

218
00:13:48.910 --> 00:13:51.640
for many decades wages were stagnant.

219
00:13:52.030 --> 00:13:55.590
And one of the basic problems was,
you know,

220
00:13:55.710 --> 00:13:59.190
what the essential reason was that uh,

221
00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:03.730
the labor markets didn't reward the new skills?
Well either.
So we,
this is the,

222
00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:04.970
here's the problem of,

223
00:14:04.980 --> 00:14:09.850
of skills and new technology which created such a challenge in the 19th century.

224
00:14:10.330 --> 00:14:14.710
Two things about a major new technology.
One is it's not standardized.

225
00:14:14.711 --> 00:14:16.670
You have different versions of it.
Uh,

226
00:14:16.690 --> 00:14:21.400
those versions change frequently and overall the technology is rapidly changing.

227
00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:27.280
What that means is number one,
schools can keep up.
It's changing too quickly.

228
00:14:27.340 --> 00:14:28.720
It's not standardized.

229
00:14:28.930 --> 00:14:32.230
The people who have it are the labor market who have the skills and have the

230
00:14:32.231 --> 00:14:35.380
knowledge are at a premium.
They're going to earn a lot more doing it,

231
00:14:35.381 --> 00:14:37.720
then they are teaching it.
Second,

232
00:14:37.750 --> 00:14:41.080
labor markets have a difficult time recognizing those skills and rewarding

233
00:14:41.081 --> 00:14:43.130
people for having acquired them.
Uh,

234
00:14:43.230 --> 00:14:45.310
there are different versions of those skills acquired.

235
00:14:45.620 --> 00:14:50.620
So an employer who wants to hire somebody with the right skills has a hard time

236
00:14:51.531 --> 00:14:54.020
figuring out whether they really have the right skills and,
and,

237
00:14:54.021 --> 00:14:58.430
and a result of this,
you have wages that are stagnant for a long period of time.

238
00:14:58.431 --> 00:15:01.250
The average wages stagnant and you have rising inequality.

239
00:15:01.251 --> 00:15:05.570
Some people do prosper.
So current day context,

240
00:15:05.571 --> 00:15:09.680
again in 1976 in real dollar terms,

241
00:15:09.681 --> 00:15:12.860
those type setters made $19 and 30 cents an hour.

242
00:15:13.370 --> 00:15:14.810
In 2014,

243
00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:18.440
that graphic designer made $20 and 7 cents an hour,

244
00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:23.230
just a little bit more over a long period of time and,

245
00:15:23.470 --> 00:15:27.710
and performing a job that is now much more sophisticated and much more skilled

246
00:15:28.010 --> 00:15:31.280
than the typesetter job.
What's going on.

247
00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:36.140
The same problem you had initially type sitters and compositors who learned in

248
00:15:36.141 --> 00:15:37.250
an apprenticeship program.

249
00:15:37.700 --> 00:15:40.760
They were soon replaced by print designers and desktop publisher.

250
00:15:41.150 --> 00:15:45.770
But then along came the Internet and now we needed web designers and then mobile

251
00:15:45.771 --> 00:15:48.530
designers and now we have specialties,
information architects,

252
00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:51.050
user interaction specialists.
The,

253
00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:54.540
the skills of the trade are constantly changing.
Um,

254
00:15:55.190 --> 00:15:57.170
schools are struggling to keep graphic design.

255
00:15:57.171 --> 00:15:59.780
Schools are struggling to keep up a labor.

256
00:15:59.781 --> 00:16:03.470
Markets are having a hard time understanding who has the right skills.

257
00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:08.480
Standards are changing in 2012 flash was required for an awful lot of website

258
00:16:08.481 --> 00:16:13.370
design flashes pretty much obsolete today.
Html five became the,

259
00:16:13.610 --> 00:16:17.410
the reigning standard.
This sort of turnover makes things difficult.
So the,

260
00:16:17.411 --> 00:16:21.620
the average designer has a prince,
a print,

261
00:16:22.010 --> 00:16:23.630
a design background.

262
00:16:24.220 --> 00:16:28.510
The schools don't have difficulty teaching.
Uh,
the,

263
00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:32.900
the latest skills.
In fact,
they may rely on,
on some of the,
the moocs to,

264
00:16:33.470 --> 00:16:34.820
for people to get the skills.

265
00:16:35.270 --> 00:16:39.140
Labor markets have a hard time recognizing those skills.
The top people,

266
00:16:39.141 --> 00:16:41.690
the top designers can teach themselves.

267
00:16:41.691 --> 00:16:45.890
Every new thing is it comes along and they can develop reputations so that the

268
00:16:45.891 --> 00:16:48.020
labor market issues are less significant.

269
00:16:48.170 --> 00:16:51.890
But what you get is the average designer has stagnant pay.

270
00:16:52.460 --> 00:16:56.990
The top designers see,
see rising pay.
And so you see growing inequality.

271
00:16:57.810 --> 00:17:00.410
Um,
so for instance,
if you look,

272
00:17:00.460 --> 00:17:04.640
and this is true across occupations,
uh,
affected by computers.

273
00:17:04.940 --> 00:17:08.480
So com occupations on the,
on the right,
that,

274
00:17:08.481 --> 00:17:12.170
that have a lot of people use computers.

275
00:17:12.950 --> 00:17:17.900
You're seeing a rapidly growing gap between the 90th percentile wage and the

276
00:17:17.901 --> 00:17:21.850
50th percentile wage.
Other occupations,
there's not much change.

277
00:17:21.870 --> 00:17:26.650
There is growing inequality related to the use of computers.
And it's this,

278
00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:31.220
this gap between the median worker who can't acquire the skills or has it,

279
00:17:31.221 --> 00:17:34.900
has difficulty acquiring the skills are getting recognized for the skills and

280
00:17:34.940 --> 00:17:36.170
the top people who can.

281
00:17:39.530 --> 00:17:40.250
So this is,

282
00:17:40.250 --> 00:17:44.150
this is a very significant social challenge created by new technology.
It's,

283
00:17:44.151 --> 00:17:46.610
it's this sort of new digital divide.

284
00:17:47.250 --> 00:17:51.000
A wage inequality is growing within occupations.
Uh,

285
00:17:51.270 --> 00:17:56.220
also because access to,
uh,
to,
to the new technology is limited by people,

286
00:17:56.460 --> 00:18:00.780
by people skills.
You know,
whether they can get the job to,
to learn on the job.

287
00:18:02.390 --> 00:18:05.730
Jobs are shifting more to it using occupations.

288
00:18:05.910 --> 00:18:08.100
Wages are growing faster for it users.

289
00:18:08.690 --> 00:18:12.870
The limited access means that some people are going to benefit and some people

290
00:18:12.871 --> 00:18:14.970
are going to be left behind and there's rising inequality.

291
00:18:17.100 --> 00:18:18.660
So what does that say about policy?

292
00:18:18.690 --> 00:18:23.630
I'll just talk a few minutes more and wrap this up.
Um,

293
00:18:24.870 --> 00:18:29.850
how can we address the,
this digital divide problem with policy?

294
00:18:30.450 --> 00:18:33.270
Some ideas and I'll just talk very briefly.
Why don't you know.

295
00:18:33.271 --> 00:18:36.570
So here's this problem.
How do we deal with skills that are learned on the job?

296
00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:41.580
Well,
one thing is work study programs.
You're seeing manufacturers,
for instance,

297
00:18:41.581 --> 00:18:46.050
working with local community colleges to set up programs where people learn some

298
00:18:46.051 --> 00:18:49.350
skills in the classroom and some skills on the job.

299
00:18:50.310 --> 00:18:51.670
Some companies are experimenting,

300
00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:55.800
experimenting with apprenticeship type programs.
Uh,

301
00:18:55.830 --> 00:18:59.820
we're seeing a number of industries,
uh,
and it's certainly true in tech,

302
00:19:00.030 --> 00:19:03.510
but you know,
a number of more traditional industries,
uh,

303
00:19:03.540 --> 00:19:07.830
working with ways of certifying skills so that people who do learn on the job

304
00:19:08.100 --> 00:19:12.540
can get the certification so that labor markets can recognize those skills and

305
00:19:12.541 --> 00:19:16.530
reward them for what they've learned to get the incentives right.

306
00:19:17.910 --> 00:19:21.540
Uh,
another thing is standardization.
When s when,
uh,

307
00:19:21.690 --> 00:19:25.800
the new technology is highly fragmented across multiple standards,
uh,

308
00:19:25.860 --> 00:19:30.860
it becomes difficult to teach in a classroom to certify a,

309
00:19:31.471 --> 00:19:33.870
so one thing that is helpful as open standards.

310
00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:37.860
Another thing is knowledge sharing of various sorts.
In the book,

311
00:19:37.861 --> 00:19:40.200
I talk about how historically,
uh,

312
00:19:40.710 --> 00:19:43.440
government procurement was often played a key role in this.

313
00:19:43.441 --> 00:19:48.030
And so you people talk about the role of government in,
for instance,

314
00:19:48.031 --> 00:19:52.170
fostering the development of semiconductors or the computer or the Internet and

315
00:19:52.171 --> 00:19:55.020
an important way government played.

316
00:19:55.750 --> 00:20:00.240
One way government played an important role was in establishing norms of

317
00:20:00.241 --> 00:20:04.590
knowledge sharing and,
and unopened standards so that,
uh,

318
00:20:04.860 --> 00:20:09.360
there could be develop a cadre of skilled technical people who shared common

319
00:20:09.361 --> 00:20:13.560
knowledge and could then take what we're initially typically defense or,

320
00:20:13.710 --> 00:20:18.710
or NASA type applications and bring them to civilian applications.

321
00:20:19.940 --> 00:20:20.910
Civilian uses.

322
00:20:22.140 --> 00:20:24.990
A third thing that is important is employee mobility.

323
00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:28.260
Labor markets for new skills,
uh,

324
00:20:28.590 --> 00:20:32.430
depend on having employees who can switch jobs,

325
00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:35.610
possibly switch occupations easily.

326
00:20:36.660 --> 00:20:39.570
We've unfortunately seen a decline in employee mobility,

327
00:20:39.571 --> 00:20:43.650
a very substantial decline over the last 15 years or so.
Uh,

328
00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:48.220
things that may be contributing to that are a agreements,

329
00:20:48.910 --> 00:20:51.830
um,
occupational licensing,
uh,

330
00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:56.730
expansions of trade secret law and,
and,
and even patents.
Um,

331
00:20:57.040 --> 00:20:59.440
so tailoring those things so that they,

332
00:20:59.710 --> 00:21:04.300
they provide the important benefits where those benefits are needed but did not

333
00:21:04.870 --> 00:21:08.890
unnecessarily impede employee mobility,
I think are,
are important factors.

334
00:21:10.030 --> 00:21:14.590
So,
to conclude,
what about the next 10 or 20 years?

335
00:21:14.770 --> 00:21:17.560
And it was,
I mean,
I'm,
I'm now going beyond the book.
I,
I,

336
00:21:17.660 --> 00:21:19.240
I've been sort of riffing on the book,

337
00:21:19.660 --> 00:21:22.810
starting with things that are in the book and drawing on some,

338
00:21:22.870 --> 00:21:23.980
some more recent research,

339
00:21:23.981 --> 00:21:27.970
but my guess is that we're going to mostly see continued job growth and the

340
00:21:27.971 --> 00:21:28.601
impact.
In other words,

341
00:21:28.601 --> 00:21:33.490
the impact of information technology has largely been positive unemployment in

342
00:21:33.491 --> 00:21:35.680
the last 10 to 30 years.

343
00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:40.780
And I think that's going to largely continue for the next 10 or 20 years.

344
00:21:41.100 --> 00:21:44.560
Uh,
because whether,
you know,
the,
the economics say that,

345
00:21:44.561 --> 00:21:47.500
what's driving that is that the nature of demand,

346
00:21:47.501 --> 00:21:52.090
it's not the nature of technology.
In fact,
people say,
well,
okay,
Moore's law,

347
00:21:52.091 --> 00:21:55.510
we're going to have technology moved faster.
Uh,
what that says,

348
00:21:55.511 --> 00:21:59.780
for my understanding of the economics is,
well that just means,
uh,

349
00:22:00.010 --> 00:22:03.730
employment growth,
employee employment will grow fast,

350
00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:06.760
not that it will decline.
Uh,

351
00:22:06.790 --> 00:22:11.630
we may sooner reached the point where things start to decline.
You know,
we,

352
00:22:11.631 --> 00:22:13.960
we saw that the,
you know,
the,
the,

353
00:22:13.961 --> 00:22:18.850
the inverse you inverted u shape of textable or manufacturing employment

354
00:22:18.851 --> 00:22:22.570
generally.
Um,
but I think the immediate impact of technology,

355
00:22:22.571 --> 00:22:27.330
even accelerated technology,
uh,
will be two will be positive,

356
00:22:27.350 --> 00:22:31.120
will not be negative in terms of him in terms of the number of jobs.

357
00:22:31.420 --> 00:22:34.040
They're going to be.
Some important exceptions to that,
uh,

358
00:22:34.450 --> 00:22:39.450
where the technology is 100% autonomous self driving vehicles for instance.

359
00:22:40.570 --> 00:22:44.410
Um,
clearly the technology is going to be able to replace humans,
but that,

360
00:22:44.710 --> 00:22:47.620
you know,
if you look at what's being developed in,
in my view,

361
00:22:47.621 --> 00:22:52.400
at least in my understanding in it,
and I wish we had better data on this,
um,

362
00:22:53.140 --> 00:22:58.140
the most of the applications of AI are going through things that enhance human

363
00:22:58.781 --> 00:23:02.000
capabilities rather than replace them.
Um,

364
00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:04.610
we're also going to see saturated demand.

365
00:23:04.930 --> 00:23:07.690
So we see saturated demand in manufacturing industries.

366
00:23:07.990 --> 00:23:12.880
And gradually as,
uh,
automation progresses,

367
00:23:12.890 --> 00:23:17.180
we can expect more in,
in,
in other areas.
Uh,
but the,
the,

368
00:23:17.181 --> 00:23:18.720
the real challenge,
which I think will,

369
00:23:18.730 --> 00:23:22.120
will only intensify over the coming years is this digital divide.

370
00:23:22.121 --> 00:23:25.560
We're going to see greater,
a greater contribution of,
uh,

371
00:23:25.650 --> 00:23:29.650
technology to wage inequality.
And from the employer's point of view,

372
00:23:29.651 --> 00:23:32.130
we're going to see,
uh,
Eh,
you know,

373
00:23:32.140 --> 00:23:36.450
complete their co today complaints about a skills gap that people can hire,
uh,

374
00:23:36.730 --> 00:23:41.110
employees with the right skills.
I think that will probably worse than to,

375
00:23:41.111 --> 00:23:43.570
unless we can somehow reverse the,

376
00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:47.240
some of the policy directions that we,
we've seen so far.

377
00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:53.390
So to sum up,
uh,
the,
the problem we face today in my view is scarce skills,

378
00:23:53.391 --> 00:23:57.410
not scarce jobs.
Um,
thank you.

379
00:24:03.810 --> 00:24:05.950
That's a good question.
Um,
you know,

380
00:24:06.470 --> 00:24:11.040
I think undoubtedly geographic inequality is a major part of the inequality we

381
00:24:11.041 --> 00:24:15.090
see today.
That said,
I think you want to be a bit careful.

382
00:24:16.170 --> 00:24:19.550
Um,
part of the reason that's true is because things aren't working well.

383
00:24:19.590 --> 00:24:23.310
Labor markets aren't working well,
people aren't willing to relocate,
uh,

384
00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:28.490
as much as economists thing.
Um,
or,
or in other,

385
00:24:28.530 --> 00:24:32.870
or at least their,
their preferences,
preferences or not to relocate.
But it's,

386
00:24:32.940 --> 00:24:34.860
it's also important not to,
um,

387
00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:38.070
I think it's easy to be sort of coastal league,

388
00:24:38.830 --> 00:24:43.320
a little nearsighted.
Um,
that the,

389
00:24:43.430 --> 00:24:47.070
the skills to develop the very latest technology and really work at the cutting

390
00:24:47.071 --> 00:24:49.950
edge are one thing.
And those are going to be concentrated in clusters.

391
00:24:50.490 --> 00:24:53.790
But if we talk,
see,
let's talk about graphic designers graphic,
you know,

392
00:24:53.791 --> 00:24:56.940
they're graphic designers in every city in the,
in the nation.

393
00:24:57.240 --> 00:25:02.240
Now it turns out that the hot markets for graphic designer in New York and San

394
00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:05.750
Francisco,
you areas where there's a lot of advertising.
You,
you don't,

395
00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:07.950
I mean there's some geographic concentration there,

396
00:25:08.430 --> 00:25:10.990
but there's also a lot of graphic tee.

397
00:25:11.010 --> 00:25:13.620
I mean there were a lot of graphic designers throughout the country,

398
00:25:13.621 --> 00:25:17.900
the people designing Webs,
web websites all over the country.
Um,

399
00:25:19.430 --> 00:25:22.560
it may well be true that if I'm an Iowa,

400
00:25:22.561 --> 00:25:27.540
I may have a harder time getting access to a training unless I leave.

401
00:25:27.980 --> 00:25:31.440
Uh,
I may have a harder time getting learning on the job skills.

402
00:25:31.441 --> 00:25:34.140
I think that that may be that that's one of the critical things.
So another,

403
00:25:35.260 --> 00:25:39.030
this is what I'm,
I was trying to say is that because it,

404
00:25:39.031 --> 00:25:42.960
it depends on learning on the job.
You have to be where the key jobs are with it.

405
00:25:43.170 --> 00:25:44.990
With the advanced jobs are,
if,

406
00:25:45.030 --> 00:25:48.480
if we can get to the point where we can learn more in school,

407
00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:52.680
learn more in text books,
learn more online into,
you know,

408
00:25:52.681 --> 00:25:54.390
where the knowledge becomes more standardized,

409
00:25:54.570 --> 00:25:57.120
then it becomes that much more easier for somebody.

410
00:25:57.120 --> 00:26:00.330
And I want to acquire the skills without having to relocate.

411
00:26:01.410 --> 00:26:06.410
There are certainly some nice examples of companies doing things that are

412
00:26:06.601 --> 00:26:08.220
getting people certain skills.

413
00:26:08.221 --> 00:26:13.221
So some of these examples where companies have worked with a local community

414
00:26:13.681 --> 00:26:15.900
colleges for instance,
or Siemens has,

415
00:26:16.050 --> 00:26:18.420
is playing around with an interesting program where they,

416
00:26:18.760 --> 00:26:22.290
it's kind of an apprenticeship program where,
uh,
you know,

417
00:26:22.440 --> 00:26:24.990
skills skills are developed,
are getting developed.

418
00:26:25.640 --> 00:26:30.450
I think on a larger scale you can look at some industries where industry models

419
00:26:30.451 --> 00:26:34.410
are working well.
So,
particularly in health care,
uh,
you're seeing,

420
00:26:35.010 --> 00:26:39.040
however screwed up the US healthcare system is,
uh,

421
00:26:39.420 --> 00:26:41.110
there are some things that,
uh,

422
00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:43.950
some business models that are very encouraging in the book.

423
00:26:43.951 --> 00:26:48.180
I write about ambulatory care centers,
these outpatient clinics for that,

424
00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:52.740
a very specialized,
um,
and they,
they've been a big growth area.

425
00:26:53.250 --> 00:26:54.410
Uh,
they,

426
00:26:54.520 --> 00:26:59.140
they are able to deliver their though these specialized services at lower costs

427
00:26:59.160 --> 00:27:02.330
and greater quality,
greater performance.
Um,

428
00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:07.440
but it turns out that they were a great way for middle-skill healthcare workers

429
00:27:07.441 --> 00:27:12.300
to acquire skills learned on the job because their specialization be so when a

430
00:27:12.301 --> 00:27:17.301
nurse goes in and is seeing knee patients day after day after day after day,

431
00:27:18.361 --> 00:27:21.600
rather than working in a hospital where they're seeing every sort of different

432
00:27:21.601 --> 00:27:26.550
patient,
they're able to quickly learn,
uh,
you know,

433
00:27:26.551 --> 00:27:27.600
what matters,
what's,

434
00:27:27.630 --> 00:27:32.400
what problems are significant and need to come to the attention of the

435
00:27:32.401 --> 00:27:34.110
physicians,
the surgeons,
uh,

436
00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:38.730
which problems are not important or it can be handled with aspirin and bed rest

437
00:27:38.731 --> 00:27:40.180
or you know,
whatever.

438
00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:44.310
The entire healthcare system is being turned upside down in this way.

439
00:27:44.311 --> 00:27:46.240
Where before it was sort of the,

440
00:27:46.460 --> 00:27:50.400
the doctors on top giving orders to everyone and now it's sort of a triage

441
00:27:50.401 --> 00:27:50.731
system.

442
00:27:50.731 --> 00:27:55.731
You start with the lower level personnel who are going to screen you and because

443
00:27:56.161 --> 00:28:00.090
they have this knowledge now,
uh,
are playing a much more valuable at all.

444
00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:02.580
And so what we're seeing is employment going up for those jobs.

445
00:28:02.581 --> 00:28:05.850
We're seeing wages going up for those jobs and that's actually working rather

446
00:28:05.851 --> 00:28:06.684
well.

447
00:28:07.650 --> 00:28:12.400
The demand for people with with skills is going up.
Yes.
Um,

448
00:28:13.110 --> 00:28:16.320
I think basically this,
this is in a sense the challenge that,

449
00:28:16.350 --> 00:28:20.070
that I would put it in sort of in the reverse,
that if we can develop

450
00:28:22.020 --> 00:28:24.150
on a social scale,
if we can develop them,

451
00:28:24.180 --> 00:28:28.620
the institutions to two d to bring people up to speed on the new skills,

452
00:28:29.070 --> 00:28:33.060
we're going to be much better off in terms both in terms of,
uh,

453
00:28:33.390 --> 00:28:35.190
delivering,
uh,

454
00:28:35.220 --> 00:28:39.480
things that might otherwise require a turn towards automation.
But we're going,

455
00:28:39.750 --> 00:28:42.420
I think the technology can basically take two courses.

456
00:28:42.421 --> 00:28:46.620
We can focus on technology that enhances human capabilities or in technology

457
00:28:46.621 --> 00:28:51.000
that replaces it.
If we do a good job at,
uh,

458
00:28:51.480 --> 00:28:53.100
at,
at developing skills,

459
00:28:53.101 --> 00:28:56.900
we're going to make it much more economical to focus on the enhancement.
Um,

460
00:28:57.660 --> 00:29:02.520
now that's if we look 30,
50,
60 years out,
I don't know,

461
00:29:02.900 --> 00:29:06.730
uh,
we're,
we're gonna we are gonna going to face a significant,
uh,

462
00:29:06.930 --> 00:29:08.340
end of work type problem.

463
00:29:08.370 --> 00:29:13.080
We are going to face a situation where the technology may be very capable of

464
00:29:13.081 --> 00:29:17.820
replacing lots of jobs.
Uh,
but we're going to be much better prepared for that.

465
00:29:18.090 --> 00:29:21.240
Number one,
if we can delay that point,
which will happen,

466
00:29:21.241 --> 00:29:24.480
I think if we are developing skills better.
And number two,

467
00:29:25.620 --> 00:29:27.060
as we do this,
as we,

468
00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:31.320
as we work more gradually from an a mode where most of the technology is going

469
00:29:31.321 --> 00:29:34.500
to enhance rather than replace,
uh,
we,

470
00:29:34.810 --> 00:29:39.390
we can work more gradually and it gives us the time to develop the social

471
00:29:39.391 --> 00:29:43.870
institutions to deal with the problems that are going to resolve them and that

472
00:29:43.871 --> 00:29:47.920
sort of thing.
So the people,

473
00:29:48.220 --> 00:29:51.250
I don't think that tends to be so much technologically determined.

474
00:29:51.970 --> 00:29:56.770
So the factory worker for instance,
that most people would say,
well,

475
00:29:56.771 --> 00:29:58.750
factory work is one of those examples.
You come in and,

476
00:29:58.751 --> 00:30:03.550
and it's a fixed job and you know,
you're there and that's it.

477
00:30:03.580 --> 00:30:07.310
And you're being hired as an unskilled worker off the street.
Uh,

478
00:30:07.330 --> 00:30:10.690
you look at what actually happened in the 19th century factories and there's

479
00:30:10.691 --> 00:30:15.100
still a lot of that happening today in today's factories.
Um,
number,

480
00:30:15.101 --> 00:30:19.130
when people came in,
they did switch from job to job.
Uh,
so the,
the,

481
00:30:19.140 --> 00:30:22.060
the people who made it into weaving often started at a,

482
00:30:22.061 --> 00:30:25.230
at a lesser skilled job and graduated into,

483
00:30:25.231 --> 00:30:30.040
into weaving where they could make bigger bucks or even into a supervisory type

484
00:30:30.041 --> 00:30:34.180
roles.
So when you have,

485
00:30:34.890 --> 00:30:37.270
you know,
a very mature industry,

486
00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:42.670
an older workforce where people have been doing this stuff for a long time,

487
00:30:42.700 --> 00:30:46.820
they're gone.
There aren't going to be opportunities for much flexibility and,

488
00:30:47.030 --> 00:30:50.890
and,
and,
and you know,
that,
that may limit things.

489
00:30:50.891 --> 00:30:55.450
But when we're talking about new technologies,
even in older industries,

490
00:30:55.800 --> 00:30:58.050
um,
it seems to me there's,
there,

491
00:30:58.060 --> 00:31:02.200
there has to be room for a lot of different organizational approaches.
Right?

492
00:31:02.201 --> 00:31:04.950
So we,
we've experimented in the past,
uh,
you know,

493
00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:09.310
with programs particularly for trade related to displacement of jobs.

494
00:31:09.850 --> 00:31:11.950
These tough tended to be small term,

495
00:31:12.580 --> 00:31:16.450
small scale programs.
Um,

496
00:31:17.290 --> 00:31:19.960
it certainly makes sense that when people have,

497
00:31:19.990 --> 00:31:24.990
are being technologically displaced that we provide a combination of retraining

498
00:31:27.610 --> 00:31:31.690
and some sort of income support.
On the other hand,

499
00:31:31.691 --> 00:31:36.250
I think we need to be careful that we don't make the income support by itself,

500
00:31:36.550 --> 00:31:37.140
uh,
you know,

501
00:31:37.140 --> 00:31:41.830
a permanent feature or that that provides disincentives for people to move on

502
00:31:41.831 --> 00:31:45.370
and acquire the new skills.
Uh,
and that reflects my,

503
00:31:46.390 --> 00:31:51.390
at least my view that people are going to be better off if they are gainfully

504
00:31:52.091 --> 00:31:55.510
employed,
if they have valuable skills.
Um,

505
00:31:56.380 --> 00:31:58.390
not only from an economic point of view,

506
00:31:58.391 --> 00:32:02.650
which I think will be a more secure economically,

507
00:32:02.740 --> 00:32:05.090
it will be more secure politically.
Um,

508
00:32:05.320 --> 00:32:08.320
but also I think in terms of people's well wellbeing,

509
00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:13.720
I think for an awful lot of people having a gainful unemployment where they're

510
00:32:14.351 --> 00:32:16.090
doing something they feel is valuable,

511
00:32:16.310 --> 00:32:20.080
is important for their personal wellbeing.

512
00:32:21.130 --> 00:32:23.380
Yet or better yet combined.
I mean,

513
00:32:23.740 --> 00:32:27.790
I'm a big believer in some of these work study programs because it combines the

514
00:32:27.791 --> 00:32:30.970
best of both that that you have people who are motivated,

515
00:32:31.150 --> 00:32:35.230
they can see the practical relevance and at the same time they can get sort of

516
00:32:35.231 --> 00:32:38.560
the formal background.
So they have a deeper understanding than they might get.

517
00:32:38.561 --> 00:32:40.160
Just just learning on the job.

518
00:32:40.730 --> 00:32:45.050
I focus on that because that's the most prevalent form of work relationship.

519
00:32:45.490 --> 00:32:46.323
Um,

520
00:32:46.820 --> 00:32:51.820
so all of these things have their own advantages and disadvantages regarding

521
00:32:51.981 --> 00:32:54.860
skills development.
So it,
and I,

522
00:32:54.920 --> 00:32:59.750
this is a much longer discussion I think.
But,
uh,

523
00:33:00.110 --> 00:33:03.470
so one of the problems is when we have,

524
00:33:03.800 --> 00:33:07.160
when labor markets aren't functioning all that well,
uh,

525
00:33:07.760 --> 00:33:09.260
the incentives for the employers or,

526
00:33:09.261 --> 00:33:12.890
and the incentives for the employees aren't really what they need to be.

527
00:33:12.891 --> 00:33:17.891
And so you have sort of these catch 22 situations where an employer is trying to

528
00:33:18.800 --> 00:33:23.660
find people who have the skills but yet isn't willing to invest as much as they

529
00:33:23.661 --> 00:33:25.580
need to in training people.

530
00:33:25.790 --> 00:33:29.840
And at the same time you have employees who are looking for jobs and looking at

531
00:33:29.841 --> 00:33:32.840
what skills they might want to acquire themselves.

532
00:33:32.900 --> 00:33:35.360
They don't have the best incentives.
If we,

533
00:33:35.660 --> 00:33:40.660
if we replace the relationship with a Gig economy type relationship,

534
00:33:42.170 --> 00:33:45.650
it's not clear to me that that's going to necessarily improve things in might

535
00:33:45.651 --> 00:33:47.780
melt well,
make things worse.

536
00:33:49.070 --> 00:33:53.750
But I have to say it depends.
Um,
so let,
let,
let me leave it at that.

537
00:33:55.700 --> 00:34:00.700
I want to hire a graphic designer to do my website and we're going to have this

538
00:34:01.071 --> 00:34:03.920
kind of website using this type of technology,
blah,
blah,
blah.

539
00:34:04.730 --> 00:34:08.480
I go out and I asked for resumes and so I'm looking,

540
00:34:08.510 --> 00:34:11.840
I get experienced people have five years experience,
two years experience,

541
00:34:11.841 --> 00:34:16.760
10 years experience.
Is that experience the right kind of experience that I need?

542
00:34:17.470 --> 00:34:19.460
Uh,
it has to be the right kind of experience,

543
00:34:19.461 --> 00:34:22.520
not only for the particular tools that I'm using,

544
00:34:22.910 --> 00:34:27.600
but the kind of organization.
Uh,
so we have websites that are,
you know,

545
00:34:27.650 --> 00:34:32.650
large websites that require these complex organizational links with databases

546
00:34:33.231 --> 00:34:36.350
and people in different departments and all sorts of specialties.

547
00:34:36.500 --> 00:34:41.300
And working in that environment is itself a,
a learn skill.

548
00:34:41.750 --> 00:34:44.190
Um,
so it,

549
00:34:44.191 --> 00:34:47.900
it becomes very hard for me to know that if I'm looking at you as a job

550
00:34:47.901 --> 00:34:50.960
candidate,
do you really have those skills or not?

551
00:34:51.560 --> 00:34:55.430
I can find out who you work for and how long you worked.

552
00:34:55.850 --> 00:34:59.810
And I can maybe understand what skills you tell me you've got.

553
00:35:00.170 --> 00:35:01.580
But it's,
it's,
it's,

554
00:35:01.581 --> 00:35:05.540
it's very hard for me to make a judgment as opposed to a situation where

555
00:35:06.140 --> 00:35:11.140
somebody is a certified developer on such and such tool.

556
00:35:12.220 --> 00:35:16.940
Uh,
you know,
that that tells me,
uh,
you know,
they,
they've got the skill,

557
00:35:16.941 --> 00:35:20.400
I need a,
it's a standardized skill.
I'm going to,

558
00:35:21.110 --> 00:35:23.570
I can hire that person when you,

559
00:35:23.690 --> 00:35:28.690
now the problem is when you get that situation where employers have a hard time

560
00:35:29.031 --> 00:35:30.830
judging,
um,

561
00:35:33.260 --> 00:35:36.250
they may not be willing to pay as much as,

562
00:35:36.500 --> 00:35:41.340
as they should do to reward the skills.
Uh,
they,

563
00:35:41.960 --> 00:35:46.640
um,
they may not be or eh,

564
00:35:46.750 --> 00:35:50.400
as eager to hire,
uh,
as they should.
Uh,

565
00:35:50.401 --> 00:35:55.020
so you know,
the,
the labor market signals of,
of,

566
00:35:55.760 --> 00:35:59.490
um,
you know,
what your value is worth it.
Are,
you know,
once those are off,

567
00:35:59.491 --> 00:36:00.241
then both your,

568
00:36:00.241 --> 00:36:03.780
your incentives to acquire a skill are diminished because you acquire the skill

569
00:36:03.781 --> 00:36:08.480
and you can't prove it right.
And the employers,
you know,

570
00:36:08.660 --> 00:36:12.040
willingness to pay you for that skill is off,
uh,

571
00:36:12.360 --> 00:36:15.750
because they have a hard time telling.
And,
and the,
the,
those,

572
00:36:15.780 --> 00:36:19.140
those things are all exacerbated if the skills are constantly changing.

573
00:36:19.320 --> 00:36:22.510
If the standards are constantly changing or a fragmented,
uh,

574
00:36:22.820 --> 00:36:24.150
I'm probably the wrong person that has,

575
00:36:24.151 --> 00:36:28.950
you may have noticed this is not on the best seller list.
Um,

576
00:36:30.060 --> 00:36:30.893
I know,

577
00:36:31.500 --> 00:36:35.970
I know where I have gotten the greatest bang in,
in,

578
00:36:36.210 --> 00:36:38.640
in publication and that is,

579
00:36:39.570 --> 00:36:43.800
I guess this is the sort of thing that the public grasps on and it's still

580
00:36:43.801 --> 00:36:48.660
relatively sophisticated,
but it's my ATM example.
So I don't know,
I mean,

581
00:36:48.661 --> 00:36:50.070
there's been just a number,

582
00:36:51.450 --> 00:36:54.970
I'm ignorant of how this,
you know,

583
00:36:55.050 --> 00:36:57.930
this process works of,
of changing public opinion.

584
00:36:57.931 --> 00:37:02.100
But what I noticed is that there are certain like means or examples or things

585
00:37:02.101 --> 00:37:05.500
that just sort of take on a life of their own.
And this is one of them.
Um,

586
00:37:05.970 --> 00:37:07.380
everybody thought,

587
00:37:07.381 --> 00:37:11.620
including Obama to made the comments that,
you know,

588
00:37:11.790 --> 00:37:16.320
the ATM destroyed the bank teller and this just sort of challenges that wisdom

589
00:37:16.500 --> 00:37:20.130
and people can sort of
grasp that at,

590
00:37:20.131 --> 00:37:24.030
at a certain level without necessarily understanding why entirely.
But it,
it,

591
00:37:24.230 --> 00:37:29.230
it gives people some understanding that it's not simply a matter of automate,

592
00:37:30.750 --> 00:37:35.220
just because automation can take over certain skills doesn't mean it takes over

593
00:37:35.221 --> 00:37:39.170
jobs.
So that's a real serious problem.
And,
and,

594
00:37:39.680 --> 00:37:44.250
and I mean,
the,
the short answer is no,

595
00:37:44.251 --> 00:37:48.340
but I,
I,
it's,
it's,
uh,
there's a,

596
00:37:48.570 --> 00:37:52.570
a connection to this whole argument,
which is,
you know,
I,

597
00:37:52.580 --> 00:37:57.580
I'm a typesetter for 25 years and the newspaper eliminates type setting.

598
00:37:58.980 --> 00:37:59.813
Uh,

599
00:37:59.970 --> 00:38:04.890
do I go learn a new skill or what do I do or do I drop out?

600
00:38:05.130 --> 00:38:10.130
So I've got to either make an investment in a new skill or I can take a much

601
00:38:11.221 --> 00:38:13.570
lower paying job,
um,

602
00:38:14.910 --> 00:38:18.440
or I can drop out of the workforce.
And,
you know,
unfortunately,

603
00:38:18.750 --> 00:38:21.720
I think we're seeing a certain amount of the drop out of the workforce,

604
00:38:21.721 --> 00:38:26.480
particularly for people,
older people,
older workers.
Uh,
and,

605
00:38:26.481 --> 00:38:27.600
and it,
it makes sense that they,

606
00:38:27.610 --> 00:38:31.650
it just isn't necessarily when it's difficult to acquire the skills and may

607
00:38:31.651 --> 00:38:34.560
require a significant investment and even then,

608
00:38:34.570 --> 00:38:39.430
maybe may has have uncertain benefits because things aren't working as they

609
00:38:39.431 --> 00:38:41.170
should entirely.
Uh,

610
00:38:41.171 --> 00:38:45.010
unfortunately the decision than many people rationally make maybe to drop out of

611
00:38:45.011 --> 00:38:48.490
the labor force.
So it's really part of the same.

612
00:38:49.180 --> 00:38:51.930
The answer is the same as,
you know,

613
00:38:52.210 --> 00:38:54.550
it's just a different manifestation at the same problem.

614
00:38:55.210 --> 00:38:59.350
So complexities the heart has at the heart of the problem and the learning by

615
00:38:59.351 --> 00:39:01.360
doing it,
it's only because

616
00:39:03.070 --> 00:39:05.320
technologies are complex that you know,

617
00:39:05.321 --> 00:39:07.540
that there's so many things that have to be learned,

618
00:39:08.050 --> 00:39:10.940
that many of them are in the,
you know,

619
00:39:11.050 --> 00:39:14.500
the less frequent reaches that occur less,

620
00:39:14.590 --> 00:39:19.120
less often and so aren't standardized and,
and,
uh,
and,
uh,

621
00:39:20.590 --> 00:39:23.710
so that they can be presented in,
in a,
in a textbook way.

622
00:39:24.200 --> 00:39:27.880
And in that that was actually actually true of things like textile technology

623
00:39:27.881 --> 00:39:32.230
just as much as it is,
I think today or maybe even it's maybe even more so today.

624
00:39:32.350 --> 00:39:37.350
But the complexity was in fact the big challenge then if you look at how and

625
00:39:38.671 --> 00:39:43.140
what it took to transport those jobs overseas.
So,
uh,

626
00:39:44.950 --> 00:39:49.420
by 1910 when I showed that that weaving room,
uh,
in fall river,

627
00:39:50.080 --> 00:39:50.590
uh,

628
00:39:50.590 --> 00:39:55.300
the most advanced technical equipment was actually installed all over the world

629
00:39:55.720 --> 00:39:58.910
in Japan,
in China,
in Russia,
and India.
Uh,

630
00:39:58.930 --> 00:40:02.200
they had the same equipment and it's some cases they even imported,

631
00:40:02.201 --> 00:40:06.980
particularly British textile managers to run some of some of these mills.
Uh,

632
00:40:07.540 --> 00:40:09.270
but the mills,
uh,

633
00:40:09.370 --> 00:40:13.840
in those countries at that time were dramatically less productive.

634
00:40:14.170 --> 00:40:19.150
I like s one six that in other words,
the workers were paid much,
much less,

635
00:40:19.450 --> 00:40:21.610
but they were also much,
much less productive.

636
00:40:21.611 --> 00:40:25.780
So it was a difficult process to learn those skills.

637
00:40:26.710 --> 00:40:30.610
Uh,
gradually over time they figured out the way.
And,
and to some extent,

638
00:40:30.820 --> 00:40:32.290
both in Japan and in China,

639
00:40:32.291 --> 00:40:36.400
they followed the model of the sort of the Lowell mills.
Uh,

640
00:40:36.401 --> 00:40:41.401
initially having boarding houses where they brought in young women to work,

641
00:40:41.590 --> 00:40:46.300
you know,
to,
to work on the loons.
And I mean,
so you,

642
00:40:46.310 --> 00:40:50.900
you still in China have these,
these um,
um,
you know,

643
00:40:51.060 --> 00:40:52.930
dormitory type factories,

644
00:40:54.010 --> 00:40:57.430
which are essentially a very similar model.

645
00:40:58.660 --> 00:41:03.130
So they,
it,
it took time.
But I mean,
I,

646
00:41:03.131 --> 00:41:05.500
I wouldn't,
um,
there,
yes,

647
00:41:05.501 --> 00:41:08.260
there are certain skills that are very simple and can be learned and things
like,

648
00:41:08.650 --> 00:41:12.010
I think particularly now electronic assembly maybe,
maybe that's,

649
00:41:12.070 --> 00:41:13.880
that's more so the case,
but there,

650
00:41:13.890 --> 00:41:18.250
there are even there no more sophisticated skills that,
that have been learned.

651
00:41:18.400 --> 00:41:22.700
And you can see it takes time to set up the institutions to set up the,
the,

652
00:41:22.950 --> 00:41:26.180
the labor markets to get things working so that,
uh,

653
00:41:26.260 --> 00:41:29.950
things like technical skills can be learned and people can be compensated.

654
00:41:30.670 --> 00:41:32.860
So the challenge we face today,

655
00:41:33.890 --> 00:41:36.470
I think it probably is true that many of these technologies,

656
00:41:36.590 --> 00:41:39.240
they're much more obscure.
Uh,
I,

657
00:41:39.400 --> 00:41:42.800
I can explain what the complexity and textiles is.
It,
you know,
it's,

658
00:41:42.801 --> 00:41:45.740
it's something will happen,
but it will happen very rarely.

659
00:41:46.070 --> 00:41:50.240
And so somebody needs a lot of experience too to understand when it's going to

660
00:41:50.241 --> 00:41:53.480
happen and what it looks like and how to avoid it.
Uh,

661
00:41:53.720 --> 00:41:57.530
with some of these machine learning systems,
uh,
you know,

662
00:41:57.620 --> 00:42:02.620
the probabilities of some of the events happening are so remote that there isn't

663
00:42:04.771 --> 00:42:09.590
a,
it's not only a skill problem,
it's also a problem of,
um,
I mean I think,

664
00:42:09.591 --> 00:42:10.320
I think there's a,

665
00:42:10.320 --> 00:42:14.120
an essential quality problem in managing the technology that that's an interest.

666
00:42:14.121 --> 00:42:17.890
So,
you know,
think about self driving cars.
We're seeing,
you know,

667
00:42:17.990 --> 00:42:21.470
sort of these black swan events that we have to worry about.

668
00:42:21.890 --> 00:42:24.950
So Tesla has this car and there's,

669
00:42:25.670 --> 00:42:30.620
it thinks that a truck crossing the road is an overhead sign.
You know,

670
00:42:30.621 --> 00:42:33.980
it's a weird event that happens very rarely,

671
00:42:35.390 --> 00:42:40.250
neither the of the technology nor the human driver knows to be aware of that.

672
00:42:40.430 --> 00:42:44.470
They don't have that skill.
Right.
Um,
so we,
we,
we have to,

673
00:42:44.630 --> 00:42:46.490
I think with his technology generally,

674
00:42:46.491 --> 00:42:51.250
we have to understand how we're going to manage these sort of a long tail,
uh,

675
00:42:51.600 --> 00:42:52.950
events,
uh,

676
00:42:53.130 --> 00:42:57.140
that are both things that make skills difficult to acquire.

677
00:42:57.260 --> 00:43:02.150
And also make it difficult to maintain quality of the products.

678
00:43:02.660 --> 00:43:03.081
I buy this,

679
00:43:03.081 --> 00:43:06.800
you're talking where somebody comes on for a limited period of time and they see

680
00:43:06.801 --> 00:43:08.600
how they do.
Yeah.

681
00:43:08.601 --> 00:43:13.010
It's a way in that those things aren't necessary.
I mean,
it's,

682
00:43:13.020 --> 00:43:18.020
some of those things were used in the past as well.
Um,
it's a way of,

683
00:43:18.050 --> 00:43:22.490
of gaging and employees,
uh,
abilities when you,

684
00:43:22.640 --> 00:43:27.350
when the labor market signals aren't so clear.
Um,
but it's also,

685
00:43:27.740 --> 00:43:29.910
it's also difficult to,
to,
for to,

686
00:43:29.930 --> 00:43:32.390
it's difficult and expensive for it to work well.
Um,

687
00:43:32.810 --> 00:43:37.250
so it's very much the same sort of statistical problem we were just talking

688
00:43:37.251 --> 00:43:42.251
about that you don't necessarily see how well an employee does until they've

689
00:43:42.891 --> 00:43:46.430
really worked a long time because the random,
you know,
you know,
there's a Pr,

690
00:43:46.460 --> 00:43:50.400
a probabilistic element that makes the signal very noisy.
Um,

691
00:43:51.110 --> 00:43:55.100
so it's a way of dealing with the problem,
but it's,
it's not a solution.

692
00:43:55.550 --> 00:43:58.920
It's a way of ameliorating the problem.
In some cases it can,

693
00:43:59.180 --> 00:44:03.910
but it comes with costs.
Well,
thank you for having me.
