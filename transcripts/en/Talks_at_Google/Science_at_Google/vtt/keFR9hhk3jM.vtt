00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:09.080
Hi Everyone,
and thank you for coming.
Um,
today,

2
00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:13.640
Authors Jorge Cham and Daniel Watson will be telling us everything they do not

3
00:00:13.641 --> 00:00:17.250
know about their new book.
We have no idea.
Um,

4
00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:22.730
Jorge Cham is the creator of the popular online comic,
piled higher and deeper,

5
00:00:22.731 --> 00:00:26.870
also known as phd comics.
He earned his phd in robotics at Stanford.

6
00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:31.400
Daniel Watson is a professor of experimental particle physics at the University

7
00:00:31.401 --> 00:00:34.820
of California,
Irvine and a fellow of the American physical society.

8
00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:38.120
He conducts research using the large Hadron collider at cern.

9
00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:42.200
Please take a moment to silence your cell phones and anything else that will

10
00:00:42.201 --> 00:00:47.090
beat and then join me in welcoming Daniel and Jorge.

11
00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:51.973
<v 1>Okay.</v>

12
00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:01.640
<v 0>Hello.
How's it going?</v>

13
00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:07.670
Okay,
so it sounded very excited.
I'll try it.
Yeah.
All right.

14
00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:13.110
Not much better,
but,
uh,
we'll take what we can get.
Well,
first of all,

15
00:01:13.111 --> 00:01:16.040
thank you to Google for inviting us here today.
Um,

16
00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:19.800
we are very excited and I will tell you exactly how excited I am,

17
00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:23.550
but a Google probably already knows everything about me,

18
00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.360
so there's no reason to tell you.
Cool.
Well,
my name is Jorge Cham.
Uh,

19
00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:31.710
as mentioned in my cartoonists and does this professor Daniel Weitzman from the

20
00:01:31.711 --> 00:01:36.510
University of California at Irvine and I together with the coauthors of this

21
00:01:36.511 --> 00:01:36.961
book called,

22
00:01:36.961 --> 00:01:41.100
we have no idea which is about all the things we don't know about the universe.

23
00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.540
Uh,
now today I'm gonna talk to you a little bit about how our collaboration

24
00:01:45.541 --> 00:01:47.850
started,
how we got together and wrote this book.

25
00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:51.270
And then Daniel will take over and he'll talk to you actually about what's in

26
00:01:51.271 --> 00:01:54.690
the book.
Now I'm a cartoonist.

27
00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.970
And to me being a cartoon ace it cartoon is,

28
00:01:57.971 --> 00:02:00.870
it's about taking a blank page and filling it with an idea.

29
00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:05.190
And so the idea we want to draw out for all of you here today is this idea that

30
00:02:05.191 --> 00:02:09.690
there are still big gaps in our knowledge of the universe.
Now,

31
00:02:09.691 --> 00:02:13.650
in addition to being a cartoonist,
I also happened to have a phd in robotics.

32
00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:15.090
Now you might be wondering,

33
00:02:15.091 --> 00:02:19.050
but us having a phd in robotics have to do with being a cartoonist.
Well,

34
00:02:19.051 --> 00:02:24.051
I can tell you that my parents were also very concerned about that whole life

35
00:02:25.201 --> 00:02:29.580
plan.
Um,
but my,
I have a phd in robotics from Stanford.

36
00:02:29.581 --> 00:02:31.890
I actually just down the street and in fact my research,

37
00:02:31.891 --> 00:02:34.830
they're focused on making robots that could run,

38
00:02:34.831 --> 00:02:37.710
they could run and walk like animals can in nature.

39
00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.420
And in particular I focused on making robots.
I could run like cockroaches.

40
00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:48.090
Yeah.
So here's a quick movie of what these robots look like.

41
00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:54.423
<v 1>No.</v>

42
00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:17.620
<v 0>Yeah.
I like to show this movie at all my presentations for two reasons.</v>

43
00:03:17.621 --> 00:03:18.011
First of all,

44
00:03:18.011 --> 00:03:23.011
I feel like this movie really kind of represents what getting a phd feels like.

45
00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:29.980
Hey,
some of you might know the feeling,

46
00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.670
you feel like you're running frantically the whole time that you're not getting

47
00:03:33.671 --> 00:03:37.840
anywhere.
Meanwhile,
there's a more intelligent being stamping you down.

48
00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.790
I know,

49
00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:43.640
but I was like to show it because it's really kind of the only way that it's one

50
00:03:43.641 --> 00:03:46.840
of the only way that anyone will look at my research.

51
00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:48.143
<v 1>Thank you.</v>

52
00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:51.850
<v 0>Gotcha.
Okay.
Cause I,</v>

53
00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:55.120
it seemed a little bit more popular than the research I spend years working on

54
00:03:55.121 --> 00:03:56.560
as part of my actual career.

55
00:03:56.561 --> 00:03:59.770
A little bit more popular has been what I was doing when it should have been

56
00:03:59.771 --> 00:04:02.230
doing research when I was procrastinating,

57
00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:06.460
which were some make these comic strips called pile tire and deeper or phd

58
00:04:06.461 --> 00:04:10.100
comics.
And these are comics that I just started writing as a graduate student.

59
00:04:10.101 --> 00:04:12.300
It was my first year,
uh,
at Stanford and I just,

60
00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:16.930
I kind of wrote about what it was like to start in a phd program and find a

61
00:04:16.931 --> 00:04:21.700
place in a lab.
All the begging you have to do.

62
00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:26.590
I also kind of wrote about what it's like to be a teaching assistant,

63
00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:34.540
right?
Dealing with those annoying undergraduates.

64
00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:40.980
We don't have any here today.
Do we any interns snow?
Oh,

65
00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:48.460
I'm sure you're a cool show.
You are here.
You must be cool.
Uh,
let's see.

66
00:04:48.461 --> 00:04:51.760
The comics were also about learning about Grad student etiquette.

67
00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:02.390
Well,
you should never ask a Grad student how,
how's your research going go?

68
00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:05.550
So I just Kinda kept drawing these comics and then one day I decided to take my

69
00:05:05.551 --> 00:05:09.810
procrastination to the next level and I started posting these on a free web

70
00:05:09.811 --> 00:05:14.250
server on campus.
And as most things,
like there's like these happen,
uh,

71
00:05:14.251 --> 00:05:15.150
on the Internet,
you know,

72
00:05:15.151 --> 00:05:18.210
somebody read it on campus and liked it and then they told their friends and

73
00:05:18.211 --> 00:05:20.990
they knew in other universities about this website and then they,

74
00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:24.510
they told their friends and their lab mates and those people told other people

75
00:05:24.511 --> 00:05:27.720
in other universities.
Uh,
and so slowly over the years,

76
00:05:27.721 --> 00:05:31.710
these comics kind of spread out into the world,
kind of like a,

77
00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:35.090
like a virus,
uh,

78
00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:39.660
to the point where about six or 7 million people a year come through the phd

79
00:05:39.661 --> 00:05:42.450
comics website,
which is a,

80
00:05:42.451 --> 00:05:45.330
an incredibly small number.

81
00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:49.560
If you think about the fact that there are about 7 billion people on this
planet.

82
00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:53.880
So there's about a 0.1% chance that you've ever heard of me before I walked into

83
00:05:53.881 --> 00:05:57.050
this room.
Uh,
but it just so happened that one of those,
uh,

84
00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:00.790
millions of people who went to their website was a professor at the university,

85
00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:03.320
University of California at Irvine,

86
00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:07.130
who saw these comics and he decided to email me one day out of the blue.

87
00:06:07.131 --> 00:06:11.090
I just get this email in my inbox saying,
hey,
Jorge,
I senior comics online,

88
00:06:11.091 --> 00:06:14.150
I think they're pretty good.
Um,
can I commission you?

89
00:06:14.151 --> 00:06:17.840
Can I pay you to write some comics about the Higgs Boson?

90
00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:21.460
Now,
this was a few years ago.
Uh,
where would,

91
00:06:21.461 --> 00:06:24.830
there was a lot of attention in the media being paid to this discovery that

92
00:06:24.831 --> 00:06:27.650
people were searching for the Higgs Boson and Daniel,

93
00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:31.190
the professor didn't think that people are doing a good job of explaining what

94
00:06:31.191 --> 00:06:35.630
this interesting and complex phenomenon was and how people were looking for it.

95
00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:39.740
So he decided to contact me and offer to commission me to make a something that

96
00:06:39.741 --> 00:06:43.070
explained what it was.
And so I thought,
what

97
00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:48.560
you want to pay me?
What is that?

98
00:06:48.561 --> 00:06:52.570
I don't understand.
I just put things on the Internet for free.
Uh,

99
00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:53.870
so I said yes.

100
00:06:53.871 --> 00:06:57.680
And so I went down and I interviewed him and we had a conversation over lunch at

101
00:06:57.681 --> 00:06:59.600
the cafeteria and instead of taking notes,

102
00:06:59.601 --> 00:07:02.090
I kind of broaden my recorder and I recorded our conversation.

103
00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:04.900
And then when I went home to draw these commies,

104
00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:07.010
I decided to experiment a little bit.
Uh,

105
00:07:07.011 --> 00:07:10.820
and so I took the audio from the recordings and I recorded myself drawing the

106
00:07:10.821 --> 00:07:12.410
comics and it kind of put those things together.

107
00:07:12.411 --> 00:07:16.880
And we made a video in addition to the comics
and,
uh,

108
00:07:16.881 --> 00:07:20.570
we decided to take this video and we posted it on this website.

109
00:07:20.571 --> 00:07:25.440
You may have heard of it.
It's called uh,
Youtube.
Uh,

110
00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:29.570
and so now I'll just clay for you guys a one or two minutes,
a clip,

111
00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:31.580
one or two minute clip from this video,

112
00:07:31.581 --> 00:07:34.940
just so you kind of get a sense of how our collaboration started.
So here's a,

113
00:07:34.970 --> 00:07:36.410
here's a clip from the video.

114
00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:41.040
<v 3>One of the things people would predict is the Higgs Boson,</v>

115
00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:46.230
the Higgs Boson is the part of that is responsible for giving mass to the other

116
00:07:46.231 --> 00:07:47.910
part of this.
You think of,

117
00:07:47.911 --> 00:07:49.710
think of something happen then asked me to have stuff to it.

118
00:07:50.250 --> 00:07:53.520
It's not actually stuff.
Earlier I was saying electron has mass,

119
00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:55.290
it has no volume happened.
There'd be,

120
00:07:55.710 --> 00:07:59.820
it turns out the mass is probably just characteristic of a particle of the way

121
00:07:59.821 --> 00:08:03.750
like charges,
but some verticals have charged electrons,
some particles don't.

122
00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:06.930
It's just a different kind of chart so you can think of mass and sort of

123
00:08:06.931 --> 00:08:10.630
gravitational charge.
And when two things have both have mess,

124
00:08:10.631 --> 00:08:11.880
they a attract each other.

125
00:08:12.470 --> 00:08:15.750
You just in that you can't have negative mass or repulsive gravity

126
00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:19.110
press.
The collision happens.

127
00:08:19.570 --> 00:08:23.520
It lasts for like 10 to the negative 23 seconds and you get one measurement,

128
00:08:23.521 --> 00:08:28.170
right?
So if you say,
well,
I'm going to plot the mass,

129
00:08:28.171 --> 00:08:29.670
the total energy of this game,

130
00:08:29.671 --> 00:08:32.850
and add this guy and he's got together and had the total energy.
This is a,

131
00:08:32.851 --> 00:08:37.760
this one axis here is number of collisions.
You're individual experiment,

132
00:08:37.761 --> 00:08:41.750
you get one measurement right here.
Another one,
you get another measurement,

133
00:08:41.751 --> 00:08:42.584
you do another one.

134
00:08:42.830 --> 00:08:46.340
Eventually you build up your data and the data looks like this,
for example.

135
00:08:48.140 --> 00:08:51.410
And then you have two theories,
right?
The predictive data one says,
well,

136
00:08:51.411 --> 00:08:53.140
I'm going to predict there's no Higgs Boson,

137
00:08:53.150 --> 00:08:54.440
so the data should fall along this line.

138
00:08:54.750 --> 00:08:56.970
The other is I'm a pretty cat plus a Higgs Boson.

139
00:08:56.971 --> 00:09:00.210
And the problem is the difference between these two theories is very small.

140
00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:04.800
And so that it's very hard to distinguish these two with our data because the

141
00:09:04.801 --> 00:09:09.030
predicted effect is tiny,
right?
If the predicted effect were huge,

142
00:09:09.450 --> 00:09:13.590
it'd be very easy to tell the difference between with expose on or not with expo

143
00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:17.160
site,
but the predicted effect is tiny.
And so it's really hard to see.

144
00:09:17.161 --> 00:09:18.960
What you need is a huge amount of data.

145
00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:22.860
You need to take a bajillion collisions before you can see the difference.

146
00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:26.520
That's why we run this thing 40 million times a second all day,

147
00:09:26.610 --> 00:09:30.840
all year to get a lot of collisions to tell the small differences between

148
00:09:30.841 --> 00:09:34.170
theories.
It's like when you take a picture of the sky,
we just take a picture.

149
00:09:34.171 --> 00:09:35.004
You get a little bit of light.

150
00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:38.040
The longer you leave your telescope looking at the sky,

151
00:09:38.330 --> 00:09:40.410
the more you can see farther away things.

152
00:09:41.430 --> 00:09:43.770
<v 0>I get a call.
That was the video.</v>

153
00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:47.670
So we posted this online.
Um,

154
00:09:47.850 --> 00:09:50.580
and then it just so happened that a few months later they actually discovered

155
00:09:50.581 --> 00:09:51.414
the Higgs Boson.

156
00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:55.320
And so when they discovered that there was a huge amount of attention paid on

157
00:09:55.321 --> 00:10:00.321
this from the media and the popular press and this video set of went viral,

158
00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:01.950
millions of people watch this video.

159
00:10:01.951 --> 00:10:05.820
And a lot of people were pointing to this video as a clearest and easiest to

160
00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:09.960
understand explanation of what this kind of complex phenomenon was and how

161
00:10:09.961 --> 00:10:13.530
people were looking for it and,
and why,
especially why they were looking for it.

162
00:10:14.010 --> 00:10:15.860
So I thought that was pretty cool that,
you know,

163
00:10:15.870 --> 00:10:19.530
the clearest and easiest to understand explanation didn't come from the New York

164
00:10:19.531 --> 00:10:24.150
Times media department.
It didn't come from some,
uh,
you know,
some,
uh,

165
00:10:24.210 --> 00:10:26.550
professional,
uh,
company or animators.

166
00:10:26.790 --> 00:10:30.090
It came from actually one of the scientists who worked on the project,

167
00:10:30.091 --> 00:10:34.140
who decided to take the initiative and commissioned an artist and work with them

168
00:10:34.141 --> 00:10:36.630
to create something that explained this to the public.

169
00:10:36.780 --> 00:10:38.990
So I thought that was pretty cool.
Uh,

170
00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.150
so since then we've worked on a couple of other projects together,

171
00:10:42.151 --> 00:10:47.140
but our latest project is this book called we have to idea,
uh,

172
00:10:47.250 --> 00:10:51.870
now to talk to you about the ideas inside of,
we have no idea is Daniel Watson.

173
00:10:57.520 --> 00:11:01.660
<v 4>Hello everyone.
Uh,
and thanks Jorge.
So,
uh,
before I get started,</v>

174
00:11:01.661 --> 00:11:04.060
I have to correct Jorge's story a little bit.

175
00:11:04.061 --> 00:11:06.940
He's a overly modest when he tells that anecdote.
Um,

176
00:11:06.941 --> 00:11:08.810
if any of you have been in academia that you know,

177
00:11:08.811 --> 00:11:11.860
that Jorge's not just a cartoonist,
he's sort of a celebrity.
Um,

178
00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:16.420
I go around and visit lots of physics labs and the almost every single wall

179
00:11:16.421 --> 00:11:20.350
there is one of Jorge's cartoons cause he's really captured the suffering of the

180
00:11:20.351 --> 00:11:23.800
graduate students.
Um,
so he's really a super well known.

181
00:11:23.801 --> 00:11:27.940
And when I was thinking about how to explain physics using cartoons,
I thought,

182
00:11:28.030 --> 00:11:28.181
well,

183
00:11:28.181 --> 00:11:32.070
who could possibly have both the artistic skills and the technical understanding

184
00:11:32.090 --> 00:11:35.350
to communicate these difficult topics?
Right.
And so my wife,

185
00:11:35.351 --> 00:11:38.020
who is also a huge fan of a phd comics said,

186
00:11:38.140 --> 00:11:41.410
why don't you email Jorge Tom and ask him to do it?
And I thought,
sure.
Yeah.

187
00:11:41.411 --> 00:11:44.220
And then I'll eat,
write an email the Brad Pitt and ask him to do,

188
00:11:44.230 --> 00:11:48.310
make a movie about me also.
Right.
Like just as likely to be successful.
But a,

189
00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:51.080
Brad hasn't gotten back to me about the movie.
Um,

190
00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:54.410
but I had the great pleasure of working with Jorge on project.
Um,

191
00:11:54.710 --> 00:11:59.680
did you're Brad Pitt in this scenario?
I like it.
Yeah.
Um,
so our book is called,

192
00:11:59.681 --> 00:12:00.850
we have no idea.

193
00:12:01.150 --> 00:12:04.780
And instead of being another science book that explains what science has figured

194
00:12:04.781 --> 00:12:05.230
out,

195
00:12:05.230 --> 00:12:08.680
that focuses of this book is not about what we don't know all the things that we

196
00:12:08.681 --> 00:12:12.370
don't know about the universe.
So if you come to hear a talk from an author,

197
00:12:12.490 --> 00:12:15.130
you expect them to be an expert on the topic or I mean real authority.

198
00:12:15.250 --> 00:12:17.410
So you might be wondering,
well,
what's this guy's expertise?

199
00:12:17.411 --> 00:12:19.930
Like not having ideas or something,
you know?

200
00:12:19.930 --> 00:12:23.170
And so it doesn't sound so great to claim that I'm an expert in our level of

201
00:12:23.171 --> 00:12:27.220
cosmic ignorance,
but that's sort of the situation.
And you might wonder,
well,

202
00:12:27.221 --> 00:12:29.380
why write a book about the things we don't know?

203
00:12:29.381 --> 00:12:31.690
And it's not that I want to celebrate our ignorance.

204
00:12:31.691 --> 00:12:34.650
There's plenty of that going on already.
It's,

205
00:12:35.130 --> 00:12:39.370
it's that I want to convince you that in science,
ignorance is opportunity.

206
00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:43.120
It's an opportunity to make discoveries because when you know what you don't

207
00:12:43.121 --> 00:12:47.440
know,
then you know where to look and how to answer these questions.
Okay?

208
00:12:47.710 --> 00:12:48.760
And so what I wanted to do,

209
00:12:48.761 --> 00:12:53.350
and what we hope to do in this book is to introduce you to are staggering cosmic

210
00:12:53.351 --> 00:12:54.730
level of ignorance,

211
00:12:54.910 --> 00:12:59.380
to prepare you for all the awesome discoveries that we think are coming around

212
00:12:59.381 --> 00:13:02.920
the corner.
Okay?
Because it's when you can confront your ignorance,

213
00:13:03.250 --> 00:13:06.070
when you could,
then you know how to,
how to look for the answers,
you know,

214
00:13:06.071 --> 00:13:10.090
how to begin your exploration and the end.
It's really about the exploration.

215
00:13:10.570 --> 00:13:14.560
And when I was a kid,
I thought the age of exploration sounded like a lot of fun.

216
00:13:14.890 --> 00:13:18.490
I mean,
all you had to do discover something new back then was jumping the ship,

217
00:13:18.670 --> 00:13:21.460
sail across the ocean and land on a new beach.
Right?

218
00:13:21.580 --> 00:13:25.420
You can be the first person to ever walk on a beach or eat a new kind of fruit

219
00:13:25.421 --> 00:13:29.230
or something,
right?
These were amazing first in human history.
And I wanted one,

220
00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:34.030
you know,
imagine like the first person to ever see the Grand Canyon,
right?

221
00:13:34.270 --> 00:13:38.050
There was a first person they've got to do that or the first person to ever eat

222
00:13:38.051 --> 00:13:40.360
chocolate,
right?
That wasn't experience.
Well,

223
00:13:40.361 --> 00:13:43.240
the first person ever eat chocolate while looking at the Grand Canyon,
right?

224
00:13:43.420 --> 00:13:45.610
These are all important first in human history.

225
00:13:45.611 --> 00:13:49.000
And I wanted it to be the first person to know something or do something or see

226
00:13:49.001 --> 00:13:50.620
something,
right?
Um,

227
00:13:50.650 --> 00:13:54.010
but as you're reading about the age of exploration that's happened hundreds of

228
00:13:54.010 --> 00:13:56.170
years ago,
you know,
there aren't any more new content,

229
00:13:56.230 --> 00:14:01.150
continents to discover or a islands to land on a name after your poodle,
right?

230
00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:05.860
Um,
and thanks to,
you know,
Google Earth for example,
it's very difficult to,
uh,

231
00:14:05.890 --> 00:14:09.200
to say that there's anything left to explore.
And the more you look around you,

232
00:14:09.201 --> 00:14:10.570
you,
the more you get to feeling like,
well,

233
00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:13.240
not only have we explored and map the surface of the earth,

234
00:14:13.390 --> 00:14:16.990
we've also really started to master technical things and the way things work,

235
00:14:16.991 --> 00:14:19.240
right?
I mean we have amazing things,
uh,

236
00:14:19.270 --> 00:14:23.230
airplanes that could fly over oceans and download all of human knowledge into a

237
00:14:23.231 --> 00:14:26.260
little device that fits in your pocket.
Right?
You know,
a,

238
00:14:26.261 --> 00:14:29.920
you can make $1 billion off of a single idea.
I mean,
it's a,

239
00:14:29.921 --> 00:14:33.700
it's truly a crazy modern world we live in.
It's an age of wonders.
Okay.

240
00:14:33.701 --> 00:14:37.420
So you might get the sense that science has mostly figure things out that were

241
00:14:37.421 --> 00:14:37.601
just,

242
00:14:37.601 --> 00:14:41.120
have a few little details to wrap up and then we're basically done understanding

243
00:14:41.121 --> 00:14:42.220
of the universe.
Well,

244
00:14:42.221 --> 00:14:45.670
the point I want to make to you today and the point in our book is that exactly

245
00:14:45.671 --> 00:14:46.720
the opposite is true.

246
00:14:47.290 --> 00:14:51.000
That in fact we were at the beginning of a new age of exploration,
an ex,

247
00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:54.080
an era of exploration that I hope will reveal staggering,

248
00:14:54.081 --> 00:14:58.910
crazy ideas about the universe that currently we have no idea about.
Okay.

249
00:15:00.110 --> 00:15:02.550
So what do I mean age of exploration?
Like how can,

250
00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:04.950
how is it possible to explore things we've had?

251
00:15:04.970 --> 00:15:07.610
We've had such a deep understanding of the universe.
Well,

252
00:15:07.611 --> 00:15:10.760
the kind of exploration I'm talking about is the kind of where we ask big

253
00:15:10.761 --> 00:15:14.990
questions.
Okay?
Really big fat,
juicy,
basic,
ancient,

254
00:15:15.020 --> 00:15:19.070
deep questions.
The kind of questions that everybody wants to know the answer to,

255
00:15:19.071 --> 00:15:23.870
right?
The really big fat questions,
the questions,
which if you knew the answer,

256
00:15:23.990 --> 00:15:27.260
it would change the way you felt about your place in the universe and the human

257
00:15:27.261 --> 00:15:29.900
situation.
You know,
these kinds of big questions.
All right,

258
00:15:29.901 --> 00:15:33.320
so let's be concrete about it.
What kind of questions am I talking about?
Well,

259
00:15:33.321 --> 00:15:35.420
you went down the hallway and ask a random person,

260
00:15:35.530 --> 00:15:38.600
what are the most important questions in life?
They might say things like this,

261
00:15:38.601 --> 00:15:43.130
right?
Well,
why are we here?
That's a big one,
right?
Uh,
what happens after we die?

262
00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:46.010
Also an important question.
If I knew the answer to that question,

263
00:15:46.011 --> 00:15:48.440
am I changed the way I live my life or treat people?
Right?

264
00:15:48.441 --> 00:15:50.090
These kinds of really deep,
big questions.

265
00:15:50.490 --> 00:15:53.330
Another popular one is what is it like to be a bat,
right?

266
00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:56.930
This is a question people think about some times and the co the,

267
00:15:56.940 --> 00:15:59.840
the interesting thing about these questions is that while they are deep

268
00:15:59.841 --> 00:16:03.680
questions and important questions,
they're also philosophy questions,

269
00:16:03.890 --> 00:16:07.430
which means that you can spend a lot of time thinking about them and arguing

270
00:16:07.431 --> 00:16:10.010
about them and not necessarily make any progress.
Right?

271
00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:13.730
Even if you smoke banana peels for 20 years and go down to the philosophy

272
00:16:13.731 --> 00:16:16.400
department,
you might not figure it out and you might think this last one,

273
00:16:16.430 --> 00:16:18.530
what is it like to be a bat?
You might think that's just a joke.

274
00:16:18.860 --> 00:16:23.390
It's actually the title of the most widely cited philosophy paper of all time.

275
00:16:23.420 --> 00:16:24.020
Okay.

276
00:16:24.020 --> 00:16:27.160
People are still arguing about what it's like to be a bat and I think they're

277
00:16:27.161 --> 00:16:30.140
never going to figure it out and that's the problem with philosophy questions.

278
00:16:30.141 --> 00:16:32.810
They're important.
They're deep.
I don't mean to dismiss philosophy,

279
00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:35.300
but they don't have objective answers.
Okay.

280
00:16:35.570 --> 00:16:39.500
The cool thing to me is that there are other questions,
questions just as deep,

281
00:16:39.740 --> 00:16:43.610
just as ancient,
just as important,
but these are science questions.

282
00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:46.430
Great questions like this.
What is everything made out of?

283
00:16:46.820 --> 00:16:51.290
How did the universe begin?
Okay,
the universe has one true history.

284
00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:55.850
It began in a certain way and no other way,
and if you knew that story,

285
00:16:56.090 --> 00:16:58.430
here's how the universe began.
Here's what came before the big bang.

286
00:16:58.490 --> 00:17:00.470
Here's what caused the big bang.

287
00:17:01.010 --> 00:17:04.100
You would feel differently about though the about our lives and the way we live

288
00:17:04.101 --> 00:17:07.280
it in the future,
right?
These are important questions at the same level.

289
00:17:07.790 --> 00:17:10.550
The cool thing is these questions if answers right,

290
00:17:10.850 --> 00:17:14.870
there is a true factual answer to these questions and we can discover it.

291
00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:18.830
If we do the right experiment and put together the right pieces and the clues,

292
00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:22.460
we could actually learn the answer after which no matter how many banana peels

293
00:17:22.461 --> 00:17:26.330
you smoke,
no reasonable people can disagree anymore about the answers,
right?

294
00:17:26.630 --> 00:17:27.141
Unfortunately,

295
00:17:27.141 --> 00:17:30.670
we can include like the u s government and the list of reasonable people anymore

296
00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:33.410
because they don't listen to science.
But you know,

297
00:17:33.411 --> 00:17:37.280
people who will listen to science and accepted the objective truths can actually

298
00:17:37.281 --> 00:17:40.160
agree on the answers to big,
deep and ancient questions.

299
00:17:40.161 --> 00:17:43.310
To me that's incredible and that's the kind of exploration that I'm talking

300
00:17:43.311 --> 00:17:46.100
about.
Okay,
so let's zoom in on one of these questions.

301
00:17:46.460 --> 00:17:49.440
This one here is the one that I spend my professional life working on.

302
00:17:49.530 --> 00:17:51.210
What is the universe made out of?

303
00:17:51.450 --> 00:17:54.570
And this is really a basic and a reasonable question.
I mean,
if you wake up,

304
00:17:54.571 --> 00:17:58.020
it's like a conscious being in the world.
You look around you and you ask,

305
00:17:58.140 --> 00:18:00.060
what am I made out of?
What was he met out of?
What does,

306
00:18:00.061 --> 00:18:02.580
how does everything put together?
What are the rules?
Right?

307
00:18:02.820 --> 00:18:06.300
What is the most basic element of matter?
How is this whole thing work?

308
00:18:06.570 --> 00:18:09.720
It's an ancient question,
basic question.
And I think a reasonable one,

309
00:18:09.740 --> 00:18:10.950
2100 the answer to,

310
00:18:11.370 --> 00:18:15.120
I remember as a kid smashing rocks together and seeing them breaking the smaller

311
00:18:15.121 --> 00:18:17.760
rocks and wondering how long can you do this for?
Right?

312
00:18:17.761 --> 00:18:20.190
Can you just keep getting smaller and smaller rocks at some point?

313
00:18:20.191 --> 00:18:21.450
Is it no longer rock?

314
00:18:21.870 --> 00:18:24.270
And I imagine that people have been doing this for a long time.

315
00:18:24.271 --> 00:18:27.800
I don't think I'm the first person to ever smash rocks together.
Right.
Um,

316
00:18:28.020 --> 00:18:31.140
I think it's an old,
it's an old question.
It's a kind of question.

317
00:18:31.141 --> 00:18:34.170
People have been asking themselves since people have been asking questions.

318
00:18:34.171 --> 00:18:38.340
Right?
Um,
and if,
uh,
you know,
if particle physicists were superheroes,

319
00:18:38.341 --> 00:18:42.100
this would be their origin story,
right?
Something like this.
This is,
uh,

320
00:18:42.210 --> 00:18:46.710
the dawn of particle physics here.
Um,
okay.
And it's an important question,

321
00:18:46.740 --> 00:18:49.980
but it's a difficult question to tackle,
right?
What is everything made out of?

322
00:18:49.981 --> 00:18:53.010
It's a big question.
How do you approach that?
Well,
in science,

323
00:18:53.011 --> 00:18:57.360
our strategy when we are tackling something very big and very difficult is try

324
00:18:57.361 --> 00:19:00.900
the dumbest thing first.
Okay.
Just do the simplest,
most obvious thing first.

325
00:19:01.050 --> 00:19:01.883
That doesn't work.

326
00:19:01.890 --> 00:19:04.530
Try the second dumbest thing or extrapolate from it a little bit,
right?

327
00:19:04.890 --> 00:19:07.080
So what's the simplest approach to answering this question?

328
00:19:07.081 --> 00:19:10.500
What is everything made out of?
Well,
you might just try a list,
right?

329
00:19:10.530 --> 00:19:14.550
Look around you and literally say what's in the universe,
right?
Okay.

330
00:19:14.551 --> 00:19:18.180
So your list might look something like this,
right?
The university has me,

331
00:19:18.181 --> 00:19:19.890
it has you.
And as a,
you know,
this rock,

332
00:19:19.891 --> 00:19:23.010
the other rock that are the rock over there,
right?
Um,

333
00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:26.070
and this list,
this is a pro approach.

334
00:19:26.071 --> 00:19:27.990
Using a list is gonna have a lot of problems,
right?

335
00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:31.320
Problem number one is the universe has a lot of rocks in it.

336
00:19:31.470 --> 00:19:33.570
So your list is going to be super duper long,
right?

337
00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:35.820
And you guys like thinking about lists and organizations,

338
00:19:35.821 --> 00:19:39.690
you might also wonder like,
well,
it's the illest exclusive or inclusive,
you know,

339
00:19:39.691 --> 00:19:40.650
cause if it's inclusive,

340
00:19:40.651 --> 00:19:43.710
then I have to have all the things in the list also in this list on the list.

341
00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:46.810
You know,
there's lots of problems there.
Um,

342
00:19:46.890 --> 00:19:51.180
the other problem with a list approach is that the universe has more than just

343
00:19:51.181 --> 00:19:52.860
rocks in it,
right?
For example,

344
00:19:52.861 --> 00:19:55.650
as you look around you and you discover the universe is full of all sorts of

345
00:19:55.651 --> 00:19:57.090
crazy,
interesting things,
right?

346
00:19:57.270 --> 00:20:00.360
There's Ross with is also air and there's water in this fire and this

347
00:20:00.361 --> 00:20:03.450
blueberries and I iPhones,
right?
And the more you look around,

348
00:20:03.451 --> 00:20:07.260
the more you sort of impressed and staggered by the incredible complexity of the

349
00:20:07.261 --> 00:20:09.840
world we live in,
right?
Uh,
for example,
you know,

350
00:20:09.841 --> 00:20:14.160
there's puppies and bicycles and strangely muscular fellows to become governor

351
00:20:14.161 --> 00:20:17.070
of California,
right?
The world is really full of interesting stuff,

352
00:20:17.071 --> 00:20:19.650
and that's one of the things that makes it a nice word to live in,
right?

353
00:20:19.651 --> 00:20:23.750
You wouldn't want to live in the world.
That's just rocks,
right?
For example.
Um,

354
00:20:24.380 --> 00:20:28.380
and it also highlights,
uh,
what's the,
uh,
a problem with this approach,
right?

355
00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:30.750
Is that the list isn't really an answer.

356
00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:33.720
If you ask me what is the world made out of,
Daniel?

357
00:20:33.721 --> 00:20:37.260
And I literally gave you a list that had everything in the universe on it that

358
00:20:37.261 --> 00:20:39.030
wouldn't really feel like an answer to your question,
right?

359
00:20:39.031 --> 00:20:42.570
It's like asking a teenager,
where are you going?
And they say out,
okay,

360
00:20:42.571 --> 00:20:45.570
well it's an answer,
but it's not really an answer to the question,
right?

361
00:20:45.571 --> 00:20:50.020
It's not a satisfying answer.
So what kind of satisfying answer would you like?

362
00:20:50.021 --> 00:20:52.840
You'd like something that reveals something about the world.

363
00:20:52.850 --> 00:20:57.610
Something explains all this incredible complexity in terms of something simpler,

364
00:20:57.611 --> 00:20:58.120
right?

365
00:20:58.120 --> 00:21:02.170
You want to peel back a layer of reality and reveal the simpler set of building

366
00:21:02.171 --> 00:21:06.370
blocks to explain all of this complexity.
So how do we do that?
Well,

367
00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:09.760
we have this dumb list,
right?
So let's try the second most dumb approach,

368
00:21:09.761 --> 00:21:13.810
which is organize our list,
right?
So we categorize things and we say,
well,

369
00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:17.980
this stuff over here is all the rock like and this stuff over here is plant
like,

370
00:21:17.981 --> 00:21:21.610
and you can argue whether Arno belongs in the rock category or the living thing

371
00:21:21.611 --> 00:21:24.530
category,
right?
Everything belongs into category somewhere.

372
00:21:24.550 --> 00:21:29.000
We're scientists about it.
And you start to notice patterns.
So you organize,

373
00:21:29.020 --> 00:21:31.300
you make a list,
you organize it,
you notice patterns,

374
00:21:31.330 --> 00:21:35.770
you ask questions about those patterns because those patterns are your clues

375
00:21:35.950 --> 00:21:39.040
there.
The roadmaps that tell you what's going on underneath,

376
00:21:39.220 --> 00:21:42.340
why are there so many rock like things and why do these things all similar,

377
00:21:42.370 --> 00:21:44.560
right?
There must be some pattern there.
Okay,

378
00:21:44.561 --> 00:21:48.790
so we've done that and a fast forward a few hundred years or a few thousand

379
00:21:48.790 --> 00:21:51.220
years depending on whether you give the Greeks any credit for this kind of stuff

380
00:21:51.580 --> 00:21:55.180
and you get to the periodic table of the elements and you guys might be
thinking,

381
00:21:55.510 --> 00:21:57.520
we're smart people.
He's a particle physicist.

382
00:21:57.521 --> 00:22:00.210
Why are we talking about high school chemistry,
right?
Periodic tables,

383
00:22:00.250 --> 00:22:04.990
high school chemistry.
Well,
it is high school chemistry.
It's also,
in my view,

384
00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:09.160
one of the most staggering achievements in human intellectual history.
Why?

385
00:22:09.460 --> 00:22:14.200
Because it's taken us from an almost infinite complexity of stuff down to a

386
00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:16.780
hundred building blocks from those hundred building blocks.

387
00:22:16.781 --> 00:22:21.400
You can make anything that you've ever touched or tasted or driven over or

388
00:22:21.430 --> 00:22:25.120
anything,
right?
Anything any human has ever interacted with has been made.

389
00:22:25.121 --> 00:22:26.800
Out of these hundred building blocks.

390
00:22:27.490 --> 00:22:30.370
If our goal is to simplify the universal reveal,

391
00:22:30.371 --> 00:22:34.330
a simpler nature underneath this is a huge step forward already,
right?

392
00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:36.730
And this is hundreds of years ago.
So it's,

393
00:22:36.731 --> 00:22:39.730
it's sort of incredible and it makes you wonder like,
why is it even possible?

394
00:22:40.150 --> 00:22:41.770
Why is it possible that we live in it?

395
00:22:41.810 --> 00:22:46.150
Why do we live in a universe where it's possible to describe complexity in terms

396
00:22:46.151 --> 00:22:48.610
of simple stuff,
right?
It means something deep.

397
00:22:48.611 --> 00:22:51.580
It means that all the complexities and the arrangements,
right?

398
00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:55.330
Not In the objects themselves,
it's reminds me of something else,
right?

399
00:22:55.331 --> 00:22:58.180
It's like the universe is organized by the Lego principle.

400
00:22:58.240 --> 00:23:01.240
Write that out of a few basic building blocks.
You can build anything.

401
00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:04.630
You can use the same basic building blocks to build dinosaurs,
right?

402
00:23:04.631 --> 00:23:08.530
Or to build a pirates,
right?
Or like dinosaur pirates,
right?

403
00:23:08.740 --> 00:23:12.700
It's incredible that anything can be made out of these building blocks.
Um,

404
00:23:13.150 --> 00:23:16.360
and to me it's interesting because it seems like if you were caveman or

405
00:23:16.361 --> 00:23:19.510
cavewoman physicists,
right?
And you are asking this question for the first time,

406
00:23:19.810 --> 00:23:21.400
you might consider various options.

407
00:23:21.610 --> 00:23:24.160
Maybe the world is not made out of basic building blocks.

408
00:23:24.161 --> 00:23:27.490
Maybe it's infinitely divisible is smaller and smaller pieces using an

409
00:23:27.520 --> 00:23:29.680
infinitely sharp knife,
right?
Could have been,

410
00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:33.940
or maybe instead of having a simpler small set of building blocks,

411
00:23:33.970 --> 00:23:37.660
maybe the number of building blocks could have mirrored the number of things,

412
00:23:37.661 --> 00:23:39.790
right?
And you could have had,
for example,
you know,

413
00:23:39.791 --> 00:23:44.200
cats are made out of cat particles and cartoonists made out of cartoon particles

414
00:23:44.201 --> 00:23:47.210
and Lomb has made out little Lama Leno's or whatever you call those particles,

415
00:23:47.211 --> 00:23:49.160
right?
That's certainly could have been.

416
00:23:49.580 --> 00:23:51.290
And if you're the first person asked this question,

417
00:23:51.291 --> 00:23:54.770
you'd have to consider every possible idea cause you have no rules about how the

418
00:23:54.771 --> 00:23:55.790
universe works,
right?

419
00:23:56.840 --> 00:24:00.020
But nothing that you see around you is a basic building block of the universe,

420
00:24:00.021 --> 00:24:01.960
right?
And we don't look,

421
00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:04.910
we don't just list the periodic table of the elements and say,
we're done.

422
00:24:05.090 --> 00:24:07.190
All right,
we start,
we don't just list the elements.
Say we're done.

423
00:24:07.250 --> 00:24:10.820
We organize our knowledge,
right?
So we group it into the periodic table.

424
00:24:10.830 --> 00:24:12.740
The elements after all,
there are patterns here.

425
00:24:12.741 --> 00:24:15.840
That's why we call it the periodic table of the elements.
Okay.
All right.

426
00:24:15.890 --> 00:24:19.110
I could see the Jorge's getting boards cause he's playing tetris theory.
Um,

427
00:24:19.850 --> 00:24:21.080
but there are patterns here,
right?

428
00:24:21.081 --> 00:24:26.081
And if our goal is to reveal one more layer of truth to reveal the simpler

429
00:24:26.870 --> 00:24:29.210
structure that underlies it,
we have to look for patterns.

430
00:24:29.211 --> 00:24:32.420
And so I'm not a chemist,
but you know,
I know that in the periodic table,

431
00:24:32.570 --> 00:24:35.930
these guys over here on the right side are not very active.

432
00:24:35.931 --> 00:24:38.690
And there's these guys over here on the left are very active in the middle you

433
00:24:38.691 --> 00:24:41.210
have these metals,
right?
And and all sorts of stuff.

434
00:24:41.211 --> 00:24:44.930
And there are patterns in the periodic table and these patterns are in fact the

435
00:24:44.931 --> 00:24:48.170
clues,
right?
They tell us what's underneath the periodic table.

436
00:24:48.560 --> 00:24:51.080
And we know now of course,
because they're all taking a high school chemistry,

437
00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:55.280
that all the patterns and the periodic tables are just emergent phenomena from

438
00:24:55.281 --> 00:24:56.570
the structure of the atom,
right?

439
00:24:56.571 --> 00:24:59.910
They were in fact clues that points at his down to reveal what the,

440
00:24:59.911 --> 00:25:02.600
the nature of the atom was.
And you know,

441
00:25:02.660 --> 00:25:06.470
the reason that these guys are noble and these guys are not noble and the the

442
00:25:06.471 --> 00:25:09.050
metals are the way they are is because of this structure.

443
00:25:09.051 --> 00:25:13.220
It's because the electrons fill up their orbital shells and don't like to play

444
00:25:13.221 --> 00:25:14.120
games anymore,

445
00:25:14.300 --> 00:25:17.630
is because of the number of protons in the atom determines the element that you

446
00:25:17.631 --> 00:25:18.080
are.

447
00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:22.370
So all of the chemical properties are just clues that pointed to the structure

448
00:25:22.371 --> 00:25:23.570
of the atom itself,
right?

449
00:25:24.020 --> 00:25:28.680
And so we can look to those clues to tell us how to understand a deeper level of

450
00:25:28.700 --> 00:25:33.440
reality right down below the Hula Hoop level.
Okay.
But remember,

451
00:25:33.620 --> 00:25:35.150
as we're exploring the universe,

452
00:25:35.210 --> 00:25:38.420
that nothing that you know is a building block of the universe.

453
00:25:38.421 --> 00:25:39.770
Nothing you've played with the chairs,

454
00:25:39.771 --> 00:25:43.790
you're sitting on the Lama you wrote to work on or had the tornadoes.

455
00:25:43.940 --> 00:25:46.210
None of these things are basic building blocks of the university.

456
00:25:46.220 --> 00:25:47.690
University is built out of deeper,

457
00:25:47.780 --> 00:25:52.290
weird or strange things that have no analog in your life,
right?

458
00:25:52.310 --> 00:25:57.110
Not even strange combinations of things like Llama tornadoes can explain the way

459
00:25:57.111 --> 00:25:58.310
the universe works.
You know,

460
00:25:58.311 --> 00:26:02.060
we like to use intuitive ideas like particles which are little spinning balls or

461
00:26:02.210 --> 00:26:06.080
waves,
which we know about from things.
Or maybe light is a particle and a wave,

462
00:26:06.081 --> 00:26:07.070
right?
In reality,

463
00:26:07.071 --> 00:26:10.280
the basic building blocks of the universe are totally alien to us.

464
00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:13.560
We can try to understand them using these analogies,
but in the end they do.

465
00:26:13.590 --> 00:26:15.680
They don't really work.
Okay,

466
00:26:15.681 --> 00:26:18.680
so let's zoom in a little bit and understand the current state of knowledge.

467
00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:19.790
Or we had the atom,

468
00:26:19.791 --> 00:26:23.000
which has protons and neutrons and electrons whizzing around that of course,

469
00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:26.480
right?
And inside the Proton and neutron or corks.

470
00:26:26.510 --> 00:26:28.100
So the UPC cork and the down quark,

471
00:26:28.101 --> 00:26:32.120
you put two up corks in a down course together to make a proton to down corks

472
00:26:32.121 --> 00:26:34.220
and up core together to make a neutron.
Right?

473
00:26:34.490 --> 00:26:36.200
And that means something sort of astounding.

474
00:26:36.650 --> 00:26:38.660
It means with just these three particles,

475
00:26:38.990 --> 00:26:41.720
up corks and down quarks to make your protons and neutrons.

476
00:26:42.290 --> 00:26:45.990
And then to complete the Adam,
you can build any Adam,

477
00:26:46.560 --> 00:26:50.850
any item can be built at a three particles and those and anything can be built

478
00:26:50.851 --> 00:26:51.391
out of atoms,

479
00:26:51.391 --> 00:26:55.350
which means anything you've ever tasted or stepped on or interacted with can be

480
00:26:55.351 --> 00:26:59.610
made out of just three particles.
That's incredible simplification,
right?

481
00:27:00.090 --> 00:27:03.240
From infinite complexity down to three particles.

482
00:27:03.690 --> 00:27:07.500
It means the recipe for building literally anything is certain number of,

483
00:27:07.501 --> 00:27:11.160
of corks,
certain number of down quarks,
electrons mix,
right?

484
00:27:11.340 --> 00:27:14.280
That's literally the recipe for everything in terms of simplification.

485
00:27:14.281 --> 00:27:17.100
That's pretty impressive.
So you might be thinking,
wow,

486
00:27:17.250 --> 00:27:20.160
we went from infinity to a hundred to three.

487
00:27:20.220 --> 00:27:22.530
We're like on the verge of figuring this out,
right?

488
00:27:22.531 --> 00:27:23.910
The trajectory is pretty good.

489
00:27:24.210 --> 00:27:27.000
If these guys had come next week and they'd be showing us the one particle that

490
00:27:27.001 --> 00:27:30.570
rules them.
All right.
Um,
so we're not quite there.

491
00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:34.800
And the point of the book is to explain to you the wrinkles in this story cause

492
00:27:34.801 --> 00:27:38.460
the wrinkles are really interesting.
Okay.
So first of all,

493
00:27:38.461 --> 00:27:41.010
one wrinkle is we don't just have these three particles.

494
00:27:41.190 --> 00:27:44.460
We found these three particles,
but there are more particles.
Okay.

495
00:27:44.461 --> 00:27:47.700
The Up Cork and the down cork,
or two examples of corks,

496
00:27:47.790 --> 00:27:52.500
but there are other corks.
There's the charm cork,
this strange cork,

497
00:27:52.830 --> 00:27:56.940
the top cork and the bottom core.
Okay?
I'm not making these names up.
Okay.

498
00:27:57.060 --> 00:27:59.610
I wish somebody had asked me.
I would've come up with Steven sillier names.

499
00:28:00.210 --> 00:28:04.440
The Electron is an example of a part of what we call the left on and this six of

500
00:28:04.441 --> 00:28:08.760
those as well.
Okay?
So we have not just three particles that make up matter.

501
00:28:08.761 --> 00:28:12.750
We have these 12 particles that we've discovered.
So what do we do in science?

502
00:28:12.751 --> 00:28:15.300
When we were confused,
we didn't know what to do.
Well,
first we just make a list,

503
00:28:15.540 --> 00:28:16.860
then we organize it,
right?

504
00:28:17.130 --> 00:28:21.330
So now the current state of knowledge is this a new periodic table?

505
00:28:21.331 --> 00:28:24.180
It's a periodic table of the fundamental particles,
right?

506
00:28:24.540 --> 00:28:27.930
And what we try to do is place all of these particles in a table so we can

507
00:28:27.931 --> 00:28:30.930
understand how they fit together.
Maybe get some clues,

508
00:28:30.931 --> 00:28:34.870
which will lead us to ask questions that will reveal an even deeper layer of,

509
00:28:34.900 --> 00:28:38.820
of the universe.
So we have the UPC cork and the down Cork,
which,
you know,

510
00:28:39.450 --> 00:28:41.430
these make the protons and neutrons together with the,

511
00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:42.870
they explain everyday matter.

512
00:28:43.230 --> 00:28:46.470
But in this first column we also include this particle called the Neutrino.

513
00:28:46.830 --> 00:28:48.420
Neutrinos are really strange,

514
00:28:48.421 --> 00:28:52.830
mysterious particle sometimes called a subatomic particle that's not really

515
00:28:52.831 --> 00:28:56.980
accurate because it's not inside the atom.
Um,
but it's a mysterious particle,

516
00:28:56.981 --> 00:28:59.220
but it's also everywhere.
For example,

517
00:28:59.280 --> 00:29:04.280
there are 100 billion neutrinos passing through my fingernail every second 100

518
00:29:04.710 --> 00:29:06.210
million and your fingernails as well,
right?

519
00:29:06.600 --> 00:29:10.290
So why are we not like getting beaten down by all of these neutrinos is they

520
00:29:10.291 --> 00:29:12.900
pass right through it without even noticing.
We don't notice them.

521
00:29:13.050 --> 00:29:15.540
They don't notice us.
Right?
It's like that guy who lives down the hall from you.

522
00:29:15.540 --> 00:29:18.240
You don't even like make eye contact,
right?
Totally.

523
00:29:18.241 --> 00:29:22.020
Just pass right through each other.
Uh,
so neutrinos ignore us and we ignore them.

524
00:29:22.290 --> 00:29:26.010
Um,
there's so many neutrinos because there are being produced by the sun,

525
00:29:26.130 --> 00:29:29.730
but it's a clue that a lot of the things that are happening in the universe all

526
00:29:29.731 --> 00:29:33.630
around you,
you're not privy to,
you can't see.
You can immediately detect,
okay,

527
00:29:33.631 --> 00:29:36.540
the universe is different from the universe that you experience.

528
00:29:36.990 --> 00:29:38.910
So we put all of these four in the same column.

529
00:29:39.210 --> 00:29:44.210
And the interesting thing is about the 12 is that there seem to be copies of

530
00:29:44.771 --> 00:29:48.040
each other,
right?
So for example,
the charm cork and the top cork,

531
00:29:48.041 --> 00:29:52.180
we put them in the same row as the UPC cork because they are copies of the

532
00:29:52.200 --> 00:29:56.770
upwork,
the exact,
exactly the same properties,
the same chart,
that same charge,

533
00:29:56.950 --> 00:29:59.740
the same interactions,
the same spin.

534
00:29:59.770 --> 00:30:04.300
All of these things are the same except the charm and the top are heavier than

535
00:30:04.301 --> 00:30:06.700
the upwork.
Okay?
Why are they there?

536
00:30:06.701 --> 00:30:10.720
Why does the upwork cork had these like weird to secret heavy cousins,
right?

537
00:30:11.020 --> 00:30:14.740
Nobody knows the charm.
Quark is much heavier than the upwork.

538
00:30:14.890 --> 00:30:18.730
The top Cork is the heaviest fundamental particle we've ever discovered.

539
00:30:18.731 --> 00:30:21.520
It's thousands and thousands of times heavier than the upwork.

540
00:30:21.820 --> 00:30:24.130
It's like the upworks corks,
secret fat country cousin.

541
00:30:24.131 --> 00:30:27.430
The can't even leave the house,
right?
It's like shins snapping the fat.
This one,

542
00:30:27.970 --> 00:30:29.800
um,
it's also easily offended.

543
00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:34.510
So the fascinating thing is that not only are there two copies of the UPC cork,

544
00:30:34.511 --> 00:30:35.950
this two copies of the downtown core,

545
00:30:35.980 --> 00:30:38.200
the strange and the bottom had the same relationship.

546
00:30:38.440 --> 00:30:42.580
They're perfect copies of the down quark,
all the same properties except heavier,

547
00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:46.870
right?
The electron also has these copies,
does the [inaudible],

548
00:30:46.900 --> 00:30:49.450
which is just a heavy version of the electron.
And then the Tao,

549
00:30:49.451 --> 00:30:51.640
which is an even heavier version of the new on this,

550
00:30:51.641 --> 00:30:53.380
even three of these neutrinos,
right?

551
00:30:53.590 --> 00:30:56.290
So we have these really interesting patterns that form when you start to

552
00:30:56.291 --> 00:30:59.770
organize our knowledge of the periodic table of the fundamental particles.

553
00:30:59.890 --> 00:31:01.690
What does it mean?
Well,

554
00:31:01.691 --> 00:31:05.350
I hope that it means that there's something deeper going on.
Currently.

555
00:31:05.380 --> 00:31:08.350
We have no idea,
but we have some fun questions,
right?

556
00:31:08.620 --> 00:31:12.070
The patterns give us questions and we hope those questions will lead us to the

557
00:31:12.071 --> 00:31:15.760
answers.
Okay.
So what questions do we have?
Well.
Question number one,

558
00:31:15.910 --> 00:31:19.630
why do we have all these particles?
You only need three to make all of matter,

559
00:31:19.660 --> 00:31:23.410
right?
Why 12 are there in fact,
12 or they're 24,

560
00:31:23.560 --> 00:31:28.330
24 billion according to theorists,
there's no limit on the number of particles.

561
00:31:28.331 --> 00:31:31.330
And you could have in a fundamental theory,
right?
Um,

562
00:31:31.420 --> 00:31:35.170
how many particles are there?
Why did the particles each have two copies?
To me,

563
00:31:35.320 --> 00:31:38.500
this is a really interesting deep question because I like thinking about
numbers,

564
00:31:38.501 --> 00:31:39.334
right?

565
00:31:39.430 --> 00:31:42.730
One of the fundamental goals of physics is to explain the whole universe in a

566
00:31:42.731 --> 00:31:45.280
simple equation.
How do you know when that,
when you're done,

567
00:31:45.281 --> 00:31:46.840
when the equation is simple enough?
Well,

568
00:31:46.841 --> 00:31:50.080
the standard people often use is if it could fit on a tee shirt,
okay?

569
00:31:50.081 --> 00:31:52.510
If you can put all of physics on a single t shirt,
then you're done.

570
00:31:53.170 --> 00:31:56.790
Imagine we were there and you're looking at that equation and there's a numbered

571
00:31:56.860 --> 00:32:00.160
right?
Five.
That means that five is a deep,

572
00:32:00.190 --> 00:32:03.100
important number somehow in the universe,
right?
All right,

573
00:32:03.101 --> 00:32:05.680
so numbers are important.
Now we look at this table,

574
00:32:05.681 --> 00:32:09.700
we see there's three copies of every particle,
right?
Why three,
right?

575
00:32:10.030 --> 00:32:11.890
If you ask theorists and mathematicians,

576
00:32:12.220 --> 00:32:14.500
what kind of numbers do you expect in a fundamental theory?

577
00:32:14.680 --> 00:32:18.310
All they have strong opinions,
right?
Zero.
That's an okay.
Number one,

578
00:32:18.430 --> 00:32:22.560
you can have tie.
Shirt Pi's a good number,
right?
No,
but he says three,
right?

579
00:32:22.810 --> 00:32:24.310
Unless they're Catholic.
Also right

580
00:32:25.810 --> 00:32:29.650
through like why is three is the number three somehow important to the universe?

581
00:32:29.890 --> 00:32:32.590
It seems to me like either it is or it's a clue.
Right?

582
00:32:32.780 --> 00:32:35.920
Then in a thousand years or 100 years,
people are going to look back and say,

583
00:32:36.040 --> 00:32:38.770
that was such an obvious clue that blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.

584
00:32:38.771 --> 00:32:41.180
Whatever secret of the universe hasn't been revealed to us yet.
Right.

585
00:32:41.420 --> 00:32:43.640
Is staring them in the face.
If I had been a physicist,

586
00:32:43.641 --> 00:32:47.120
then I totally want to figured it out.
Right?
It's one of those screaming clues.

587
00:32:47.121 --> 00:32:50.270
That way we just don't know what it means right now.
We just know it's a clue.

588
00:32:50.420 --> 00:32:51.253
Right?

589
00:32:51.320 --> 00:32:54.890
Another big mystery about these particles is the relationship of the masses.

590
00:32:54.890 --> 00:32:58.880
We know that in general,
they tend to have more mass as you go this direction,

591
00:32:59.150 --> 00:33:01.850
but there's no pattern to the masses.
The Higgs Boson,

592
00:33:01.851 --> 00:33:05.120
if you know anything about it,
explains how the particles get mass,

593
00:33:05.270 --> 00:33:08.330
but it doesn't tell you why this one got a lot of mass and this one got almost

594
00:33:08.331 --> 00:33:13.160
none,
right?
There's no explanation for that at all.
And the ratios are crazy.

595
00:33:13.400 --> 00:33:16.550
The top quark is thousands of times heavier than any of the other particles.

596
00:33:16.551 --> 00:33:19.080
It's,
it's,
it's really strange.
Um,

597
00:33:19.100 --> 00:33:22.820
but one of my favorite ones is this one about the charges of the particles.

598
00:33:22.910 --> 00:33:26.450
So the electronic charge of minus one,
sort of by definition,
um,

599
00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:29.200
but the quirks of these really strange fractional charge,

600
00:33:29.201 --> 00:33:32.360
it's like two thirds minus one third,
right?
How's that even possible?

601
00:33:32.361 --> 00:33:35.600
A fractional charge.
Well that's just because of how you define that,

602
00:33:35.660 --> 00:33:39.320
the charge of the electron.
But the interesting thing is about the ratios.

603
00:33:39.560 --> 00:33:43.760
These guys add up two thirds,
two thirds,
one third to make plus one a proton,

604
00:33:43.790 --> 00:33:46.640
which perfectly balanced is the electron,
right?
Well,

605
00:33:46.641 --> 00:33:50.390
that's convenient because you need that exact balance to have neutral atoms.

606
00:33:50.630 --> 00:33:54.530
And to have physics and chemistry and biology and silly physics books and free

607
00:33:54.531 --> 00:33:58.910
lunch in the cafe or at all,
that stuff rests on this perfect balance.

608
00:33:59.360 --> 00:34:02.840
But in our theory,
that's a perfect coincidence.

609
00:34:03.170 --> 00:34:04.910
We have two knobs in the theory,

610
00:34:05.060 --> 00:34:07.100
the charge of the electron and the Charter of the corks.

611
00:34:07.260 --> 00:34:09.410
And if you're the control panel of the universe,

612
00:34:09.530 --> 00:34:12.590
you could set those things to be anything and you still get a valid theory of

613
00:34:12.591 --> 00:34:17.570
physics.
So why do they balance perfectly well either it's a huge monster,

614
00:34:17.571 --> 00:34:21.740
cosmic level coincidence and not an almost coincidence like the moon and the sun

615
00:34:21.741 --> 00:34:24.290
being the same size in the sky.
So you get an eclipse,

616
00:34:24.650 --> 00:34:29.630
but a perfect exact coincidence.
Okay,
that's strange,
right?
That's a clue.

617
00:34:29.930 --> 00:34:32.150
But our current theory,
we say no,
there's no relationship,

618
00:34:32.230 --> 00:34:34.670
right to arbitrary numbers.
To me,

619
00:34:34.671 --> 00:34:36.830
it's possible that there's a simpler explanation,
right?

620
00:34:36.831 --> 00:34:41.090
That these things are actually built out of the same smaller set of Lego blocks,

621
00:34:41.091 --> 00:34:44.960
which would explain why they have a perfect balance in their and their charges.

622
00:34:45.110 --> 00:34:49.430
But currently we have no idea what that explanation is and we don't.

623
00:34:49.431 --> 00:34:51.110
Just like thinking about how the particles,

624
00:34:51.111 --> 00:34:53.000
we also like thinking about how they talk to each other,
right?

625
00:34:53.150 --> 00:34:55.340
The forces they feel when they come into into play.

626
00:34:55.700 --> 00:34:59.950
And before Jorge was the favorite cartoonists for particle physicist,

627
00:34:59.951 --> 00:35:02.750
we had Richard Fineman who came up with a Fineman diagram,

628
00:35:02.751 --> 00:35:04.850
sort of a cartoony way of thinking about physics.

629
00:35:05.240 --> 00:35:08.780
And he thought about the way particles interact with each other by drawing these

630
00:35:08.781 --> 00:35:09.380
diagrams.

631
00:35:09.380 --> 00:35:12.710
And so the straight lines or particles moving and the wiggly lines are particles

632
00:35:12.711 --> 00:35:16.790
talking to each other and we can use his calculations and this strategy to

633
00:35:16.791 --> 00:35:18.440
predict the results of experiments.

634
00:35:18.650 --> 00:35:20.540
And you've ever worked in an experimental lab,

635
00:35:20.541 --> 00:35:23.240
you know that if you predict an experimental result and you get within like a

636
00:35:23.241 --> 00:35:27.260
factor of two,
you're like wow,
it all,
it works science.
Yeah,
it's amazing.
Well,

637
00:35:27.261 --> 00:35:30.590
we can predict the results of experiments and get the results to agree with the

638
00:35:30.591 --> 00:35:34.550
theory to 10 decimal places,
10 decimal places.

639
00:35:34.700 --> 00:35:35.990
It's incredible precision.

640
00:35:36.470 --> 00:35:39.690
So the theory we have about how the particles talked to each other works super

641
00:35:39.691 --> 00:35:40.680
duper well.
Right.

642
00:35:40.980 --> 00:35:44.310
It almost makes you think if you're a conspiracy theorist that like maybe we are

643
00:35:44.311 --> 00:35:47.820
living in a simulation and we've uncovered the source code of the universe.

644
00:35:47.821 --> 00:35:48.450
You know,

645
00:35:48.450 --> 00:35:52.170
maybe this is how the cow in the universe does the calculations to decide what

646
00:35:52.171 --> 00:35:53.670
an electron is supposed to do,
right?

647
00:35:54.060 --> 00:35:57.180
Because this doesn't happen by random that you get this level of agreement by

648
00:35:57.181 --> 00:35:57.901
random chance.

649
00:35:57.901 --> 00:36:01.110
It'd be like hitting a golf ball in New York and getting a hole in one in China.

650
00:36:01.140 --> 00:36:02.850
Okay.
It just doesn't happen by chance.

651
00:36:03.420 --> 00:36:07.260
But we don't measure our particle theory just by how well does it work?

652
00:36:07.261 --> 00:36:10.320
Like does it predict experiments?
Remember,
we want a really simple theory.

653
00:36:10.321 --> 00:36:11.670
We want to simplify the universe.

654
00:36:11.671 --> 00:36:15.480
So let me show you the current state of the art and thinking in particle
physics.

655
00:36:15.660 --> 00:36:18.750
This is the Lagrangian that describes the standard model of particle physics.

656
00:36:18.780 --> 00:36:23.370
Okay.
And you know,
in my estimation,
it doesn't quite yet fit on a tee shirt.

657
00:36:23.371 --> 00:36:26.930
In fact,
only half of the terms could fit on the screen.
Um,

658
00:36:27.210 --> 00:36:28.410
so we're not quite there yet.

659
00:36:28.411 --> 00:36:31.530
We have a lot of questions left about how these particles talk to each other.

660
00:36:33.030 --> 00:36:35.010
Um,
but that's not the end of the story.

661
00:36:35.010 --> 00:36:37.140
That's not even the biggest problem in particle physics,
right?

662
00:36:37.141 --> 00:36:40.200
So first I want you to go away with a feeling of like,
wow,
there are a deep,

663
00:36:40.201 --> 00:36:43.560
basic questions about how particles work that we don't know,
right?

664
00:36:43.770 --> 00:36:45.750
We're standing,
we've made a lot of progress,

665
00:36:45.751 --> 00:36:49.440
but we're staring into the abyss and we feel like in a thousand years people

666
00:36:49.441 --> 00:36:50.940
will look back and think,
wow,

667
00:36:50.941 --> 00:36:53.970
those things were really obvious or a wish they knew this,

668
00:36:53.971 --> 00:36:56.250
or how could they not have figured that out?
Right?
Well,

669
00:36:56.251 --> 00:37:00.150
it turns out all of those questions are a tiny fraction of the questions we have

670
00:37:00.151 --> 00:37:03.720
about the universe because the particles I've introduced you to in the everyday

671
00:37:03.721 --> 00:37:07.320
matter than you familiar with and everything that makes up me and you and

672
00:37:07.321 --> 00:37:12.321
hamsters and stars and dust and planets only accounts for a tiny fraction of the

673
00:37:12.571 --> 00:37:14.850
universe.
All of that effort,

674
00:37:14.851 --> 00:37:18.930
understanding matter only explains a little sliver of what the universe is

675
00:37:18.931 --> 00:37:22.710
actually made out of,
right?
So all that great progress then,
you know,

676
00:37:22.711 --> 00:37:23.670
divided by 20.

677
00:37:23.850 --> 00:37:28.320
So it turns out that only 5% of the universe is this kind of stuff,
right?

678
00:37:28.710 --> 00:37:33.120
So we've measured very precisely the fraction of stuff in the universe.

679
00:37:33.330 --> 00:37:37.590
That's our kind of stuff.
And that's 5%.
The rest of it is a big mystery,
right?

680
00:37:37.620 --> 00:37:38.820
The rest of the stuff in the universe,

681
00:37:38.821 --> 00:37:41.370
we don't really have any idea what this kind of stuff is.

682
00:37:41.940 --> 00:37:44.580
So it's an incredible moment in physics and moment.

683
00:37:44.581 --> 00:37:46.200
I call it precision ignorance,

684
00:37:46.440 --> 00:37:50.310
when we've measured very precisely that we don't know very much about the

685
00:37:50.311 --> 00:37:50.691
university.

686
00:37:50.691 --> 00:37:53.700
And that's exciting because it means we have a lot of things left to discover.

687
00:37:53.880 --> 00:37:57.540
So how is it possible that we could know that we know very little about the

688
00:37:57.541 --> 00:37:59.760
universe?
Right?
How does that exactly work?
Well,

689
00:37:59.761 --> 00:38:01.500
let me tell you a little bit about it.
Uh,

690
00:38:01.550 --> 00:38:04.470
the first part of the story begins with Galaxy Spinning.

691
00:38:05.130 --> 00:38:08.700
So somebody sent their Grad student out to look at galaxies and understand how

692
00:38:08.701 --> 00:38:11.260
they spin.
And if you want to think about galaxies,

693
00:38:11.290 --> 00:38:12.720
a good model is to think about,
um,

694
00:38:12.721 --> 00:38:15.090
a merry go round with a bunch of ping pong balls on it.

695
00:38:15.480 --> 00:38:17.520
What happens if you spin that merry go round?
Well,

696
00:38:17.521 --> 00:38:19.470
the ping pong balls are going to fly out,
right?

697
00:38:19.710 --> 00:38:22.260
Unless there's some force holding them in.

698
00:38:22.590 --> 00:38:27.000
So in the case of galaxies that forces gravity keeps all the stars from flying

699
00:38:27.001 --> 00:38:30.570
out of the edge of the,
of the,
of the galaxy.
So you can do something interesting,

700
00:38:30.571 --> 00:38:35.410
which is measure how fast the galaxy is spinning and then count up all the stars

701
00:38:35.411 --> 00:38:36.070
and ask,

702
00:38:36.070 --> 00:38:40.150
is there enough gravity to keep all the stars in based on how fast they're

703
00:38:40.151 --> 00:38:43.660
spinning?
So somebody sent their Grad student off,
make sure this works.
You know,

704
00:38:43.661 --> 00:38:45.280
make these two measurements.
Make sure they agree.

705
00:38:45.730 --> 00:38:48.940
And what they discovered is that the galaxies are spinning much,

706
00:38:48.970 --> 00:38:51.310
much faster than they should be able to.

707
00:38:51.850 --> 00:38:55.660
Galaxy spinning that fast should be throwing their stars out into inner space

708
00:38:55.661 --> 00:38:58.900
all the time because there isn't nearly enough gravity to hold them in when

709
00:38:58.901 --> 00:39:02.140
they're spinning that quickly.
This is a really perplexing results.

710
00:39:02.141 --> 00:39:04.840
For a long time people didn't understand it and they thought,
well,

711
00:39:04.841 --> 00:39:08.080
maybe you mismeasured how the galaxies are spinning or you miss counted the

712
00:39:08.081 --> 00:39:11.890
stars or something is crazy.
And then eventually people thought,
well,

713
00:39:11.980 --> 00:39:14.710
maybe there's something else in those galaxies.

714
00:39:14.920 --> 00:39:19.720
Maybe there's some sort of new invisible thing cause we don't see it that has a

715
00:39:19.721 --> 00:39:21.340
lot of gravity to it,
right?

716
00:39:21.341 --> 00:39:24.700
So you need something that's invisible and has gravity.
So they called it,

717
00:39:24.701 --> 00:39:27.100
they didn't know what it was,
but they call it dark matter.

718
00:39:27.550 --> 00:39:30.040
And literally dark matter is the name of the theory.

719
00:39:30.041 --> 00:39:32.230
It's also a summary of what we know about it,
right?

720
00:39:32.350 --> 00:39:36.010
It's dark and it has mattered.
And that's basically what we know.
Okay.

721
00:39:36.160 --> 00:39:40.000
That's the idea.
It's also what you know was the problem he was trying to solve.

722
00:39:40.001 --> 00:39:44.530
Like there must be some sort of dark matter restuff to explain all of this.
Um,

723
00:39:45.040 --> 00:39:47.260
so it was a big mystery for a long time.
But if you,

724
00:39:47.380 --> 00:39:50.890
if you postulate the existence of a huge amount of invisible matter in these

725
00:39:50.891 --> 00:39:53.770
galaxies,
it explains why they're spinning so fast.

726
00:39:54.190 --> 00:39:56.230
But to understand how dark matter is dark,

727
00:39:56.231 --> 00:39:59.200
we have to spend a moment thinking about how particles interact.

728
00:39:59.650 --> 00:40:02.740
So we say dark matter is dark because it doesn't give off light.

729
00:40:02.840 --> 00:40:05.440
It doesn't reflect light the way planets and stars do,
right?

730
00:40:05.620 --> 00:40:07.630
That means it doesn't feel electromagnetism,

731
00:40:07.631 --> 00:40:10.090
which is one of the four fundamental forces responsible.

732
00:40:10.090 --> 00:40:12.790
The one responsible for light.
This also gravity,

733
00:40:13.030 --> 00:40:16.060
which anything that has mass will feel,
gravity will attract itself.

734
00:40:16.510 --> 00:40:19.270
Then there's the weak nuclear force and the strong nuclear force which are

735
00:40:19.271 --> 00:40:22.660
responsible for holding the nucleus together and also radioactive decay.

736
00:40:23.260 --> 00:40:27.190
So when we talk about dark matter and we know the dark matter feels gravity,

737
00:40:27.340 --> 00:40:30.310
right?
Because that's how it was discovered.
It's basically,
uh,
you know,

738
00:40:30.340 --> 00:40:33.670
explains the extra gravity we need for the galaxies to rotate.

739
00:40:33.910 --> 00:40:37.210
We know it doesn't feel electromagnetism because if it did,

740
00:40:37.211 --> 00:40:38.320
then we would have seen it,
right?

741
00:40:38.750 --> 00:40:41.880
It doesn't feel the weak force and it doesn't feel as strong forest.

742
00:40:42.070 --> 00:40:45.940
And as far as we know,
dark matter doesn't feel any other kind of force at all.

743
00:40:46.210 --> 00:40:49.340
We've been trying to interact with dark matter in lots of ways.
Um,

744
00:40:49.360 --> 00:40:52.660
but it never seems to respond even to our Facebook requests,
right?

745
00:40:52.990 --> 00:40:55.150
All we know about dark matter is that it feels gravity.

746
00:40:55.151 --> 00:40:59.810
It sort of defined by to be the thing that gives the extra gravity.
Um,

747
00:41:00.640 --> 00:41:04.870
and so 5% of the universe is the stuff we know that we still have a lot of

748
00:41:04.871 --> 00:41:05.704
questions about.

749
00:41:05.830 --> 00:41:09.850
The fascinating thing about dark matter is that you need a lot of it to explain

750
00:41:09.851 --> 00:41:13.450
how the galaxies are spinning.
It's not like,
oh,
you need 1% or 2%.

751
00:41:13.451 --> 00:41:16.300
It's a little bit of a correction.
It's a mammoth correction.

752
00:41:16.630 --> 00:41:21.010
You have to multiply the amount of matter in all the stars by a factor of five

753
00:41:21.160 --> 00:41:24.610
to get enough gravity.
Explain how rapidly these galaxies are spinning.

754
00:41:24.880 --> 00:41:28.510
It's a crazy idea,
right?
When we think of a new physics theory,

755
00:41:28.511 --> 00:41:32.200
we like simplicity,
right?
Think of the simplest theory that explains your data.

756
00:41:32.560 --> 00:41:32.711
Well,

757
00:41:32.711 --> 00:41:36.980
if you're a theory requires an immense amount of invisible matter that permeates

758
00:41:36.981 --> 00:41:38.570
the universe of nobody's ever discovered before.

759
00:41:38.840 --> 00:41:41.780
Well maybe you go back and check your calculations right before you get that

760
00:41:41.781 --> 00:41:45.400
published.
And it took people a long time to accept the idea of dark matter.

761
00:41:45.980 --> 00:41:48.830
In fact,
it wasn't until people found other ways to see dark matter,

762
00:41:48.880 --> 00:41:52.250
they really became convinced it was a thing and not a mistake.
Uh,

763
00:41:52.270 --> 00:41:56.660
one really cool way to see dark matter is to see it acting as a lens in the sky.

764
00:41:57.020 --> 00:42:01.160
So dark matter is invisible,
which means light passes through it,
but it has mass.

765
00:42:01.161 --> 00:42:05.960
So it bends space and it can bend light as well.
Uh,
acting like a lens.

766
00:42:05.961 --> 00:42:10.910
So imagine there's a huge blob of invisible dark matter between you and some
far,

767
00:42:10.911 --> 00:42:14.570
far away galaxy.
What happens to photons leaving that galaxy?
Well,

768
00:42:14.810 --> 00:42:16.970
a photon zooming off in one direction,

769
00:42:17.120 --> 00:42:20.000
we'll get bent towards you by this blob of dark matter,
right?

770
00:42:20.330 --> 00:42:24.110
A photon zooming off in another direction also gets bent towards you.

771
00:42:24.560 --> 00:42:27.380
So what happens if you look out in the sky in two different directions?

772
00:42:27.500 --> 00:42:31.010
You see the same galaxy two places in the sky,
right?

773
00:42:31.550 --> 00:42:34.760
It looks just like a lens is acting somewhere in the sky.
In fact,

774
00:42:34.940 --> 00:42:37.400
it's more than just duplication and actually gets distorted.

775
00:42:37.560 --> 00:42:41.030
All sorts of interesting optical effects,
just like you would expect from a lens.

776
00:42:41.240 --> 00:42:43.250
You can Google image,
search it later.
It's pretty awesome.

777
00:42:43.251 --> 00:42:46.640
It's called gravitational lensing.
And when people saw this,
I thought,
well,

778
00:42:46.641 --> 00:42:49.100
there must be some invisible stuff out there.

779
00:42:49.190 --> 00:42:52.940
There really does have gravity to it.
It's pretty,
pretty spectacular discoveries.

780
00:42:54.020 --> 00:42:57.410
And the last bit came from a collision.
Now I'm a particle physicist,

781
00:42:57.440 --> 00:42:59.600
so when I want to solve a problem or understand something,

782
00:42:59.690 --> 00:43:02.720
I smashed stuff together.
Okay.
That's like my modus operandi,
right?

783
00:43:03.050 --> 00:43:05.900
Collide particles together and look to understand what's inside them.

784
00:43:06.290 --> 00:43:09.410
If you want to understand galaxies,
that approach,
it doesn't really work,
right?

785
00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:11.090
You can't say like go to the government and say,

786
00:43:11.180 --> 00:43:15.410
I want funding to be able to galaxy collider.
Okay.
Even these days,
uh,

787
00:43:15.530 --> 00:43:19.730
we don't have enough funding for science.
Um,
so we can't use all the signs,

788
00:43:19.731 --> 00:43:22.850
finance,
Galaxy,
collider.
So an astrophysicist has a different approach.

789
00:43:22.880 --> 00:43:24.290
Instead of building a collider,

790
00:43:24.380 --> 00:43:27.980
they just look out into space and hope to find this experiment already
happening.

791
00:43:28.270 --> 00:43:29.690
And fortunately they found one.

792
00:43:29.930 --> 00:43:34.930
So the bullet cluster is a mammoth cluster of two mammoth collision of two

793
00:43:35.031 --> 00:43:36.290
clusters of galaxies.

794
00:43:36.710 --> 00:43:40.550
So a cluster of galaxies has both normal matter and dark matter in it.

795
00:43:40.790 --> 00:43:44.540
So what happens when these two things slammed into each other?
Well,

796
00:43:44.720 --> 00:43:47.480
the normal matter smashed into itself just like you would expect when two

797
00:43:47.481 --> 00:43:51.290
planets collide in science fiction movies,
right?
Boom,
boom,
everybody runs away.

798
00:43:51.600 --> 00:43:55.190
Um,
but the dark matter passes right through the normal matter.
Okay?

799
00:43:55.191 --> 00:43:55.911
It's invisible.

800
00:43:55.911 --> 00:43:59.480
It's also untouchable the way neutrinos are and it passes through.

801
00:43:59.481 --> 00:44:02.270
The normal matter also passes through itself.

802
00:44:02.330 --> 00:44:04.430
So just pass through itself to the other side.

803
00:44:04.880 --> 00:44:07.520
So you get dark matter on either side and in the middle you have these big

804
00:44:07.521 --> 00:44:08.840
explosions from normal matter.

805
00:44:09.320 --> 00:44:12.410
That's really cool because it means that the normal matter was separated from

806
00:44:12.411 --> 00:44:13.244
the dark matter.

807
00:44:13.460 --> 00:44:17.030
And you can use gravitational lensing to see directly that the dark matter is

808
00:44:17.031 --> 00:44:19.970
there,
right?
And the normal matter is still in the center.

809
00:44:20.210 --> 00:44:21.820
So this is the way you can separate the two.

810
00:44:21.840 --> 00:44:24.320
You can see that dark matter really is its own thing.

811
00:44:24.650 --> 00:44:28.430
It's not just a weird miscalculation of gravity or new theory of gravity for

812
00:44:28.431 --> 00:44:32.550
normal matter.
It's its own new kind of invisible stuff.
All right,

813
00:44:32.551 --> 00:44:35.850
so the bullet cluster really was the nail in the coffin for all the other

814
00:44:35.851 --> 00:44:38.520
theories that tried to explain dark matter and get ms people.

815
00:44:38.521 --> 00:44:42.120
That dark matter really is a thing.
It's really out there.
Okay,

816
00:44:42.121 --> 00:44:46.590
so what is dark matter?
Right?
We know that it's dark,
right?

817
00:44:46.591 --> 00:44:48.690
We know that it's matter.
I mean it was a lot of it.

818
00:44:48.930 --> 00:44:52.290
That mostly sums up what we think,
you know,
we don't know what it is.

819
00:44:52.291 --> 00:44:54.510
We know that there's more of it than our kind of matter.

820
00:44:54.930 --> 00:44:58.170
Now we're particle physicists.
So our work is this.

821
00:44:58.171 --> 00:45:01.260
Our natural inclination is to explain the unknown in terms of the known.

822
00:45:01.680 --> 00:45:04.770
So for example,
one of the favorite theories about what is dark matter is,

823
00:45:04.920 --> 00:45:07.800
well maybe dark matter is made out of particles just like we are made out of

824
00:45:07.801 --> 00:45:08.634
particles,
right?

825
00:45:08.940 --> 00:45:13.560
And the favorite theory is called a weakly interacting massive particle,
right?

826
00:45:13.620 --> 00:45:16.920
Wimp.
And that's one of the favorite theories.
Another one is,
well,

827
00:45:16.921 --> 00:45:19.530
maybe it's this big blobs of matter out of the space.

828
00:45:19.531 --> 00:45:24.330
It's called a massive astrophysical compact halo object right now if there is

829
00:45:24.331 --> 00:45:28.530
called the Macho,
okay?
So even in science we have the wimps versus the machos,

830
00:45:28.531 --> 00:45:32.490
right?
These are two ideas,
but they're sort of extrapolations from what we know,

831
00:45:32.491 --> 00:45:33.324
right?
Um,

832
00:45:33.330 --> 00:45:37.200
and is dangerous to extrapolate to a quarter of the universe from a tiny,

833
00:45:37.201 --> 00:45:40.830
probably atypical sliver that you've been studying for hundreds of years,
right?

834
00:45:40.831 --> 00:45:42.600
So we should keep that in mind.
Um,

835
00:45:42.660 --> 00:45:46.020
and the other thing to remember is that dark matter isn't out there in the

836
00:45:46.021 --> 00:45:49.290
universe.
Dark matters everywhere.
Dark matters here in this room,
okay?

837
00:45:49.410 --> 00:45:52.790
I have dark matter in my hands right now.
It passes right through us.

838
00:45:52.800 --> 00:45:55.680
I can hold it or contain it,
but it's here with us.

839
00:45:55.680 --> 00:45:57.720
It's not like out there somewhere.
Um,

840
00:45:57.990 --> 00:46:00.540
maybe dark matter's a totally new kind of matter.

841
00:46:01.260 --> 00:46:03.000
Maybe it's not even made out of particles,
right?

842
00:46:03.270 --> 00:46:07.050
Or maybe it's made out of a whole new kind of particles the way we are,
right?

843
00:46:07.080 --> 00:46:11.010
Many different kinds of particles.
So maybe this complex,
dark matter,
physics,

844
00:46:11.230 --> 00:46:14.040
dark matter,
chemistry,
dark matter of biology,
right?

845
00:46:14.160 --> 00:46:17.730
For All we know there could be dark matter life right here in this room with us,

846
00:46:17.731 --> 00:46:19.830
right?
And if you were dark matter life,

847
00:46:20.100 --> 00:46:22.350
you wouldn't think of us as normal matter,
right?

848
00:46:22.351 --> 00:46:26.070
We're the little sliver 5% you could almost round away and your understanding of

849
00:46:26.071 --> 00:46:29.820
the universe in some dark matter of physics classes,
a professor saying,
yeah,

850
00:46:29.821 --> 00:46:33.810
we understand 96% of the universe except for this little weird sliver,
right?

851
00:46:34.550 --> 00:46:37.560
Um,
so maybe there are dark matter tourists,
right?

852
00:46:38.490 --> 00:46:41.910
So 5% of the universe is explained by the particles.

853
00:46:41.910 --> 00:46:46.170
We have some clue about 27% of the universe is dark matter,
right?

854
00:46:46.290 --> 00:46:49.590
We know it's there.
We don't know very much about it.
That's still is.

855
00:46:49.650 --> 00:46:54.090
Two thirds of the universe is budget a totally unaccounted for,
right?
Um,

856
00:46:54.170 --> 00:46:56.130
no accounting firm is going to accept that.

857
00:46:56.131 --> 00:46:59.970
So what is the rest of this pie while the rest of this pie is filled by

858
00:46:59.971 --> 00:47:02.370
something called dark energy?
Okay.

859
00:47:02.430 --> 00:47:06.120
But dark energy is really science code for we are totally clueless.
Okay.

860
00:47:06.121 --> 00:47:09.660
How about the rest of the universe?
Because the truth is,
and until 20 years ago,

861
00:47:09.661 --> 00:47:13.230
we didn't even know that we were clueless about this part.
Okay.

862
00:47:13.231 --> 00:47:14.340
And now don't be confused.

863
00:47:14.341 --> 00:47:17.970
Dark energy and dark matter have no relationship other than literally the word

864
00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:21.840
dark.
Okay?
That's the only connection between the two theories.
Okay?

865
00:47:21.841 --> 00:47:25.410
So how do people even figure out that dark energy was a thing?
Well,

866
00:47:25.411 --> 00:47:28.290
people were thinking,
thinking about the history of the universe.
Okay?

867
00:47:28.440 --> 00:47:29.800
So if you know of a physics,

868
00:47:29.890 --> 00:47:32.380
here's a brief summary of the history of the universe.
Okay.

869
00:47:32.381 --> 00:47:34.120
So first you had the big bang,
right?

870
00:47:34.870 --> 00:47:38.410
And all this stuff in the universe exploded out.
And then,
you know,

871
00:47:38.411 --> 00:47:41.920
interesting stuff happened and people were wondering what's going to come next?

872
00:47:41.950 --> 00:47:46.950
So is there enough gravity in the stuff in the universe for things to slow down,

873
00:47:47.360 --> 00:47:51.070
turn around,
and then come back into a big crunch?
Okay.

874
00:47:51.071 --> 00:47:54.580
That was one possible explanation for the history of the universe.
Uh,

875
00:47:54.581 --> 00:47:55.660
the future of the universe.

876
00:47:55.840 --> 00:47:59.380
Another possibility is that there wasn't enough stuff in the initial explosion,

877
00:47:59.500 --> 00:48:02.320
not enough gravity to,
to turn things around.
And it was just,

878
00:48:02.321 --> 00:48:05.050
just Griff drift out.
Gradually slowing down,

879
00:48:05.051 --> 00:48:09.030
cooling off till the universe cools off and spreads out into something that

880
00:48:09.031 --> 00:48:12.770
known affectionately as the heat death of the universe.
Okay.
And now,

881
00:48:12.820 --> 00:48:13.930
not a cozy time,

882
00:48:14.490 --> 00:48:17.230
but these were the two possible theories of people who are considering the big

883
00:48:17.231 --> 00:48:21.490
crunch or the heat death of the universe.
So they said,
well,
let's measure it.

884
00:48:21.491 --> 00:48:24.320
Let's go out and look,
see if things are speeding up or uh,

885
00:48:24.580 --> 00:48:26.290
see how much things are slowing down.

886
00:48:26.800 --> 00:48:30.130
So it turns out the universe preferred secret option C,

887
00:48:30.160 --> 00:48:32.050
which is neither of these ideas,
right?

888
00:48:32.170 --> 00:48:35.320
Which to me is like the best case in science when you discover something that

889
00:48:35.321 --> 00:48:37.150
nobody expected to be the answers,
right?

890
00:48:37.510 --> 00:48:40.390
So they went out and they measured it and they discovered that actually what's

891
00:48:40.391 --> 00:48:44.830
happening is that it's not slowing down at all.
It's expanding faster and faster.

892
00:48:44.831 --> 00:48:48.760
It's accelerating in its expansion.
Right.
That's crazy.

893
00:48:48.761 --> 00:48:53.620
Nobody even thought about that as an idea because to accelerate the size of the

894
00:48:53.621 --> 00:48:55.780
universe requires some sort of force,
right.

895
00:48:55.780 --> 00:48:58.540
Which requires some sort of energy and the amount of energy that would be

896
00:48:58.541 --> 00:49:02.140
required.
Well,
that'd be like two thirds of all the energy in the universe,
right?

897
00:49:02.260 --> 00:49:05.230
That would be totally crazy.
In fact,
that's what's happening.

898
00:49:05.440 --> 00:49:09.160
And we have no idea why.
Right?
We know that it's happening and we measured it.

899
00:49:09.161 --> 00:49:12.280
We see that the universe is expanding faster and faster every year.

900
00:49:12.460 --> 00:49:13.690
We just don't know why.
Right?

901
00:49:13.870 --> 00:49:18.130
What could possibly be responsible for accelerate for pushing galaxies,

902
00:49:18.131 --> 00:49:21.040
a boy from each other?
I mean,
galaxies are heavy,
right?

903
00:49:21.370 --> 00:49:24.850
Hundreds of billions of stars in them.
Stars are not tiny objects.

904
00:49:25.150 --> 00:49:28.090
What could be responsible for pushing all of these galaxies,
uh,

905
00:49:28.150 --> 00:49:30.610
apart from each other,
right?
We have no idea,

906
00:49:30.910 --> 00:49:34.270
which means that we have no idea whether it's going to turn around or whether

907
00:49:34.271 --> 00:49:36.640
it's going to continue or whether it's going to increase.
Right?

908
00:49:37.030 --> 00:49:39.130
But it is a fascinating and consequence to it.

909
00:49:40.030 --> 00:49:44.580
The space between us and other galaxies is growing at faster than light can

910
00:49:44.581 --> 00:49:47.740
traverse that space.
What does that mean?

911
00:49:48.040 --> 00:49:51.880
It means that these galaxies are gonna move out beyond our visible horizon.

912
00:49:52.180 --> 00:49:55.030
Right?
So every year that you look up at the night sky,

913
00:49:55.031 --> 00:49:57.130
it's going to get darker and darker and darker.

914
00:49:57.490 --> 00:50:01.180
So imagine doing astrophysics and 10 billion years,
right?

915
00:50:01.420 --> 00:50:03.910
If human civilization survives the next three years,
right?

916
00:50:04.390 --> 00:50:06.440
Or until the next election.
Um,

917
00:50:06.850 --> 00:50:09.850
so imagine in 10 billion years we're trying to rebuild human astrophysics,
right?

918
00:50:09.851 --> 00:50:12.730
And people are looking at it in the sky and wondering where does everything

919
00:50:12.731 --> 00:50:12.911
right?

920
00:50:12.911 --> 00:50:16.690
Or is there anything out there they can be looking up into a totally black sky,

921
00:50:17.170 --> 00:50:19.510
which case they would have no clue about how things work.

922
00:50:19.720 --> 00:50:22.990
All the critical information that we learned from looking at the stars,

923
00:50:23.320 --> 00:50:25.270
they would be totally ignorant of.
Now,

924
00:50:25.271 --> 00:50:28.370
before you feel like too great about the fact that we are are living,

925
00:50:28.371 --> 00:50:31.640
now we can use the stars to help us understand the universe.
Remember,

926
00:50:32.060 --> 00:50:35.660
we're 14 billion years into the history of the universe already.

927
00:50:36.140 --> 00:50:39.290
If we had evolved 10 billion years ago and looked up at the night sky,

928
00:50:39.291 --> 00:50:44.030
then what would it have revealed to us that's now totally gone and lost forever?

929
00:50:44.190 --> 00:50:48.680
Well,
we have no idea,
right?
So the future of the history,

930
00:50:48.710 --> 00:50:51.560
the future of the universe is something we don't understand,
right?

931
00:50:51.860 --> 00:50:54.560
It's not something we can predict because we have no understanding of the

932
00:50:54.561 --> 00:50:57.650
mechanism by which the universe is expanding.

933
00:50:57.920 --> 00:51:01.580
And it's only recently that we've even understood that it is expanding.
Right?

934
00:51:01.940 --> 00:51:04.490
So that's why I say where at a special moment in physics,

935
00:51:04.510 --> 00:51:08.840
who he's very recently figured out exactly how little we know about the
universe,

936
00:51:09.140 --> 00:51:12.890
which means that we have an opportunity to learn something about it.
Okay?

937
00:51:13.160 --> 00:51:16.490
So here's a pie chart to summarize our knowledge of the universe,
right?

938
00:51:16.790 --> 00:51:20.330
Most of the universe is something we just don't understand that.
All right?

939
00:51:20.331 --> 00:51:23.510
We labeled the dark energy so we can write grants about it.
The sound cool,

940
00:51:23.780 --> 00:51:27.260
but really we have no clue what this thing is.
There are some ideas.

941
00:51:27.590 --> 00:51:30.680
People come up with theoretical explanations for work.
Dark energy might be,

942
00:51:30.860 --> 00:51:34.520
and they do calculations and they compare those to what we see and they're off

943
00:51:34.521 --> 00:51:37.400
by 10 to the 100.
Okay?

944
00:51:37.640 --> 00:51:39.890
There's only like 10 to the 80 particles in the universe.

945
00:51:39.891 --> 00:51:43.970
So tend to the 100 is a huge,
um,
huge mistake.
Uh,

946
00:51:43.990 --> 00:51:48.110
27% of the universe is dark matter is something we know it's there.

947
00:51:48.111 --> 00:51:50.660
We know it's matter.
We don't have really anything else about it.

948
00:51:50.690 --> 00:51:53.810
Is it one particles had lots of particles.
Is it something else?
Totally weird.

949
00:51:53.810 --> 00:51:57.250
We don't know the rest of the universe,
this little corner,

950
00:51:57.270 --> 00:51:59.750
this 5% the et cetera part of the universe.

951
00:51:59.900 --> 00:52:03.690
That's me and you and ice cream and bicycles.
Okay.
We are really the,

952
00:52:03.850 --> 00:52:08.600
the little bits of the universe.
And so you might think,
well how,

953
00:52:08.630 --> 00:52:09.840
uh,
how are we in,

954
00:52:10.320 --> 00:52:13.370
in making progress in understanding this question about what is the universe

955
00:52:13.371 --> 00:52:16.700
where it's sort of like,
imagine somebody told you to understand elephants,

956
00:52:16.880 --> 00:52:19.730
then you spend 300 years only studying the tail,

957
00:52:19.820 --> 00:52:22.520
not even realizing there was more to the story.
Right?

958
00:52:22.820 --> 00:52:25.820
And then one day finally somebody walks around to the front like,
excuse me,

959
00:52:25.821 --> 00:52:28.610
maybe you want to like look at the rest of the elephant,
right?
Well,

960
00:52:28.611 --> 00:52:29.900
what are you going to do in that situation?

961
00:52:29.901 --> 00:52:32.540
How are you going to feel confident in understanding the rest of the elephant?

962
00:52:32.541 --> 00:52:35.360
Right?
Well,
what you're probably going to do is say,
well,

963
00:52:35.390 --> 00:52:38.450
maybe the rest of the elephant is made out of tails also.
Right?

964
00:52:38.451 --> 00:52:42.470
Or like I can describe the elephant as a linear combination of tales that I

965
00:52:42.471 --> 00:52:45.230
already understand,
right?
Because you're going to cling to the theories,
you know?

966
00:52:45.231 --> 00:52:48.290
Right.
Well,
you might think that's ridiculous and it's absurd.

967
00:52:48.291 --> 00:52:50.000
It's obviously a stupid thing to do.

968
00:52:50.390 --> 00:52:53.810
That's exactly the same argument I made 10 minutes ago about dark matter,
right?

969
00:52:54.200 --> 00:52:57.920
Maybe dark matters also made out of particles,
right?
Because that's all we know.

970
00:52:58.220 --> 00:53:01.100
So we should be careful and extrapolating our knowledge to the rest of the

971
00:53:01.101 --> 00:53:02.170
universe.
It's a,

972
00:53:02.180 --> 00:53:05.930
it's a great tendency and physics to extrapolate from the known into the
unknown,

973
00:53:05.931 --> 00:53:09.320
but it's also dangerous when you're extrapolating from an unrepresentative

974
00:53:09.340 --> 00:53:11.990
sliver.
So I don't mean to be depressing.

975
00:53:11.991 --> 00:53:16.730
What I mean to do is to encourage you and to think about the kinds of things we

976
00:53:16.731 --> 00:53:19.580
might be thinking about in the future.
Because this is a special moment.

977
00:53:19.580 --> 00:53:21.920
If physics,
when you realize that you don't know very little,

978
00:53:22.040 --> 00:53:25.320
it's a chance you have to reboot to throw away everything you thought you knew

979
00:53:25.321 --> 00:53:28.230
and think,
you know what?
Maybe we're looking at unrepresentative slice.

980
00:53:28.350 --> 00:53:30.930
We need to come up with some crazy new ideas,
right?

981
00:53:31.230 --> 00:53:33.450
It's those moments when you know,
you know very little.

982
00:53:33.510 --> 00:53:36.840
They give you the opportunity to totally like come up with something completely

983
00:53:36.841 --> 00:53:41.820
new that could blow your mind,
right?
And in 200 years or in 500 years,

984
00:53:42.150 --> 00:53:47.100
children's books about the universe will contain fax.
That to us are crazy.

985
00:53:47.340 --> 00:53:51.030
Then we wouldn't even believe,
right?
Imagine giving this talk to Isaac Newton,

986
00:53:51.060 --> 00:53:53.970
right?
Staggering genius in the history of human physics.

987
00:53:54.150 --> 00:53:57.060
He had no idea about any of this stuff and it would totally blow his mind.

988
00:53:57.330 --> 00:53:59.370
How can we take anything he said?
Seriously,
right?

989
00:53:59.490 --> 00:54:01.380
He had no clue about the cosmic situation.

990
00:54:01.980 --> 00:54:04.230
The way we think about primitive caveman.

991
00:54:04.231 --> 00:54:06.600
It's the way future scientists will think about us.

992
00:54:06.810 --> 00:54:10.230
At least we know that we don't know very much about the universe,
right?

993
00:54:10.560 --> 00:54:12.990
Which gives us a heads up or a way to get started.

994
00:54:13.950 --> 00:54:16.740
So we know that we don't know very much about the universe.
However,

995
00:54:16.741 --> 00:54:20.970
it is an exciting time because at the same time as we know that we're clueless,

996
00:54:21.150 --> 00:54:24.240
we're also building awesome new tools to help us solve these mysteries.

997
00:54:24.540 --> 00:54:28.590
So we have the large Hadron collider smashes particles together and try to see

998
00:54:28.591 --> 00:54:29.424
what's inside them.

999
00:54:29.760 --> 00:54:34.200
We have the gravitational wave observatory is that can see ripples in space and

1000
00:54:34.201 --> 00:54:37.770
time and black holes colliding billions of years ago,
which is pretty awesome.

1001
00:54:38.190 --> 00:54:42.030
We have space telescopes which would help us look back in the early moments of

1002
00:54:42.031 --> 00:54:44.880
the universe and figuring out these questions about how things got started or

1003
00:54:44.881 --> 00:54:47.180
what happened before the big bang.
And the,

1004
00:54:47.190 --> 00:54:50.820
hopefully in the future we will have even cooler technologies maybe given to us

1005
00:54:50.821 --> 00:54:53.980
by our alien friends.
So I,
um,

1006
00:54:54.090 --> 00:54:57.900
I like to think that this is an amazing period in physics that in the next five

1007
00:54:57.901 --> 00:54:59.610
years or 10 years or 15 years,

1008
00:54:59.730 --> 00:55:03.120
we will make some of these discoveries answered some of these questions and they

1009
00:55:03.121 --> 00:55:06.930
will really,
um,
maybe be a turning point in the history of physics.

1010
00:55:07.080 --> 00:55:09.870
I hope that in a hundred years people think back and think,
wow,

1011
00:55:09.871 --> 00:55:12.050
I wish I had been a physicist back in 2020.

1012
00:55:12.051 --> 00:55:14.520
And when they really figured out whatever it is we're about to figure out,

1013
00:55:14.550 --> 00:55:17.700
you know,
I like to think about the discovery of quantum mechanics,
right?

1014
00:55:17.940 --> 00:55:21.090
All those experiments people did over,
like of course,
of 10 years or so,

1015
00:55:21.300 --> 00:55:24.720
people just sat down and thought about it and figured it out and revealed what

1016
00:55:24.721 --> 00:55:26.370
the true nature of the universe was.

1017
00:55:26.370 --> 00:55:29.550
And I sometimes think if I had been around then I totally would've figured it

1018
00:55:29.551 --> 00:55:33.060
out.
Right?
But when you're standing at the forefront of human knowledge,
right?

1019
00:55:33.090 --> 00:55:35.160
Not knowing which direction to go,

1020
00:55:35.310 --> 00:55:37.530
any of these possible crazy ideas could be true.

1021
00:55:37.680 --> 00:55:40.020
It's not easy to know which direction is correct.
Right?

1022
00:55:40.320 --> 00:55:41.910
So in hindsight it might be obvious,

1023
00:55:41.911 --> 00:55:44.820
but here we are and not knowing much about the universe.

1024
00:55:45.420 --> 00:55:50.190
So to round out our tour a silly charts about the universe and to impress on you

1025
00:55:50.250 --> 00:55:54.720
how little we understand about the universe,
right?
This bit here is dark energy,

1026
00:55:54.721 --> 00:55:58.800
right?
Most of the universe is something totally not understandable to us,
right?

1027
00:55:58.890 --> 00:56:01.920
This bit here,
dark matter is something we're pretty sure it's matter,

1028
00:56:01.921 --> 00:56:05.400
but that's about all we know.
And this little bit is me,
you and dark chocolate.

1029
00:56:07.410 --> 00:56:10.080
And so in our book we talk about this one question,

1030
00:56:10.200 --> 00:56:11.670
what is the universe made enough?

1031
00:56:11.910 --> 00:56:15.510
Because it's one of these deep and ancient questions that we think can be

1032
00:56:15.511 --> 00:56:17.490
answered and will be answered.
And when it is,

1033
00:56:17.640 --> 00:56:19.410
we'll change the way we think about the universe.

1034
00:56:19.530 --> 00:56:22.380
But there are lots of these questions in science,
big,
deep,

1035
00:56:22.410 --> 00:56:24.880
ancient questions with answers,
right?

1036
00:56:24.881 --> 00:56:27.550
Questions like what happened before the Big Bang,
right?

1037
00:56:27.730 --> 00:56:29.410
Nobody knows the answer to that question.

1038
00:56:29.590 --> 00:56:33.190
Even the early moments of the big bang or is still a mystery or even more basic

1039
00:56:33.191 --> 00:56:36.970
questions like what is space?
You know,
you might think,
well,
that's obvious.

1040
00:56:36.971 --> 00:56:40.870
Space's emptiness,
right?
It's just the abstract backdrop on which things happen.

1041
00:56:41.170 --> 00:56:44.980
Well,
we know now that that's not true because we know the space can expand.

1042
00:56:45.210 --> 00:56:49.030
I mean,
those space can bend space can even ripple.
Okay.

1043
00:56:49.630 --> 00:56:52.270
Emptiness cannot ripple.
So space is not just engineers.

1044
00:56:52.300 --> 00:56:53.560
It's a thing that we live in.

1045
00:56:54.040 --> 00:56:57.790
It's like as if we were fish and we've been swimming and water for thousands of

1046
00:56:57.790 --> 00:57:00.160
years,
not even realizing the water was a thing.
We just thought it was,

1047
00:57:00.161 --> 00:57:03.520
you know the thing we were,
we're in,
right?
And then you discover,
oh,

1048
00:57:03.521 --> 00:57:06.790
it's a dynamical thing with properties,
right?
Space.
It's like that.

1049
00:57:06.791 --> 00:57:09.520
It might even have strange phases and we haven't even explored,

1050
00:57:09.970 --> 00:57:13.480
we don't know basic things about space,
like how many dimensions are there?
Well,

1051
00:57:13.481 --> 00:57:15.040
there's three that we're familiar with.

1052
00:57:15.370 --> 00:57:19.480
Robot string theory predicts 11 or 26 and there's lots of ways that it could be.

1053
00:57:19.481 --> 00:57:22.270
It could be extra little curled up loops of dimensions that were not even

1054
00:57:22.271 --> 00:57:24.430
familiar with.
So really basic,

1055
00:57:24.431 --> 00:57:27.490
ancient questions about the universe have not been answered,

1056
00:57:27.610 --> 00:57:30.670
but they have answers,
right?
These answers that can be revealed.

1057
00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:35.140
So we talk about all of those in the book and the point of our book and our

1058
00:57:35.141 --> 00:57:38.410
presentation today is not to convince you the science doesn't know anything.

1059
00:57:38.680 --> 00:57:42.340
It's just to show you the science will make great discoveries in the future and

1060
00:57:42.341 --> 00:57:46.570
to prepare you for those by introducing you to our cosmic level of ignorance.

1061
00:57:46.720 --> 00:57:48.250
So thanks very much for your attention.

1062
00:57:57.300 --> 00:58:00.050
<v 2>So we're right up at the end of our allotted time,</v>

1063
00:58:00.051 --> 00:58:02.780
but I think we can take a couple of questions if anyone has any.

1064
00:58:02.900 --> 00:58:03.890
And then afterwards,
uh,

1065
00:58:03.920 --> 00:58:08.570
Daniel and Jorge had been kind enough to do a book signing and stick around and

1066
00:58:08.571 --> 00:58:10.070
answer any other crazy questions you have.

1067
00:58:17.640 --> 00:58:18.473
<v 1>Uh,</v>

1068
00:58:20.950 --> 00:58:24.690
<v 2>no questions.
Oh,
here we go.
Here's some questions.
Just mine.</v>

1069
00:58:27.230 --> 00:58:28.970
Hi.
Thanks for giving us a great talk.
Thank you.

1070
00:58:28.971 --> 00:58:31.310
Are there any questions in the bus in this book that you would have liked to

1071
00:58:31.311 --> 00:58:34.430
explore but did not nice to fit in the book?
Yeah,

1072
00:58:34.500 --> 00:58:37.110
<v 4>there are a lot of questions that we don't have the answer to that.</v>

1073
00:58:37.111 --> 00:58:38.950
We also didn't talk about it in the book.
Um,

1074
00:58:39.390 --> 00:58:43.110
in the book we try to limit ourselves to questions that we thought people could

1075
00:58:43.111 --> 00:58:46.950
understand without any scientific background,
like simple,
deep questions.

1076
00:58:47.040 --> 00:58:48.840
For example,
a lot of people ask us,

1077
00:58:48.841 --> 00:58:52.170
why didn't you talk about the mysteries of Neutrino Oscillations in the book?

1078
00:58:52.500 --> 00:58:54.600
Holding the Trina is are interesting,
but it takes you to,
you know,

1079
00:58:54.601 --> 00:58:57.180
like it's like a 20 minute explanation for why they're interesting.

1080
00:58:57.660 --> 00:59:01.410
So we tried to focus on things that were very accessible.
Uh,
but you know,

1081
00:59:01.411 --> 00:59:04.020
there are other things like mysteries of quantum mechanics that would take a

1082
00:59:04.021 --> 00:59:04.854
whole other book.

1083
00:59:05.210 --> 00:59:09.350
<v 2>Um,
cool.
Thank you.
So stay tuned for our next book.</v>

1084
00:59:10.150 --> 00:59:14.630
I still have no idea.
Um,

1085
00:59:14.660 --> 00:59:17.000
which ones are your favorites individually?

1086
00:59:19.410 --> 00:59:22.520
<v 4>I think one of my favorites is the question of what is space because it's not a</v>

1087
00:59:22.521 --> 00:59:24.380
question you hear a lot of people even ask,

1088
00:59:25.100 --> 00:59:27.230
but I think it's really deep and important question.

1089
00:59:27.710 --> 00:59:30.800
I really liked writing that chapter because I like thinking about what space
was,

1090
00:59:30.980 --> 00:59:33.890
you know,
I first heard about like space expanding.
I was like,

1091
00:59:33.891 --> 00:59:37.550
what does that even mean?
It's like I understand each word individually,

1092
00:59:37.670 --> 00:59:41.780
but together it's like,
it doesn't make any sense.
Right?
Um,
so it's,

1093
00:59:41.781 --> 00:59:45.590
once you liberate yourself from the idea that space is an abstract idea and

1094
00:59:45.591 --> 00:59:48.830
discover there's a physical thing that you can think about how it changes and

1095
00:59:48.831 --> 00:59:51.200
moves,
it's a totally different way of thinking about the universe.

1096
00:59:51.350 --> 00:59:52.580
That was my fun.
My favorite one.

1097
00:59:53.280 --> 00:59:54.113
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1098
00:59:54.530 --> 00:59:58.780
<v 0>Uh,
my favorite,
uh,
a chapter 13,
you get the book,
it's a very special chapter.</v>

1099
00:59:59.750 --> 01:00:03.860
Uh,
but now there's also a chapter I really like called a bad cosmic race sign.

1100
01:00:03.900 --> 01:00:08.090
And I like it because it's a very,
very specific mystery.
Like we're,
uh,

1101
01:00:08.350 --> 01:00:12.160
like Dana mentioned,
we're being bombarded by particles all the time.
Uh,

1102
01:00:12.200 --> 01:00:15.100
and there are some,
especially there are interesting because they're super,

1103
01:00:15.101 --> 01:00:16.300
super high energy.
Like,

1104
01:00:16.301 --> 01:00:20.060
there's super duper high energy we're being shot at by these particles and

1105
01:00:20.080 --> 01:00:23.590
nobody really knows where they're coming from or what could be making them.

1106
01:00:24.010 --> 01:00:29.010
Like there's no process in nature or astrophysics or physics that scientists

1107
01:00:29.081 --> 01:00:33.430
know about or could even imagine could be producing these super high energy

1108
01:00:33.431 --> 01:00:36.670
particles.
And so the possibilities are like insane.

1109
01:00:36.671 --> 01:00:40.630
Like there could be some totally new thing in the years nobody has ever seen

1110
01:00:40.631 --> 01:00:45.540
before or it could be like aliens shooting at us.
Um,

1111
01:00:45.760 --> 01:00:48.580
uh,
so it's,
it's pretty,
it's a pretty cool,
uh,
mystery.

1112
01:00:59.280 --> 01:01:03.850
<v 4>Hi.
Thank you for the talk.
Wasn't there a theory that our universe,
uh,</v>

1113
01:01:03.990 --> 01:01:08.010
starts with a big band and crunches and then big button again and what happened

1114
01:01:08.011 --> 01:01:11.340
to that theory if we're expanding now?
Great question.
Yeah.

1115
01:01:11.580 --> 01:01:15.540
So there was a theory that sort of a cyclical universe,
big bang,
big crunch,

1116
01:01:15.541 --> 01:01:17.530
Big Bang,
big crunch,
right?
Um,

1117
01:01:17.970 --> 01:01:21.000
the theory is less popular now because of dark energy because we know that the

1118
01:01:21.001 --> 01:01:25.470
universe is expanding like crazy.
So it's,
but we don't know what dark energy,
uh,

1119
01:01:25.740 --> 01:01:27.900
holds for the future.
Dark energy,
for example,

1120
01:01:27.901 --> 01:01:30.150
only turned on about 5 billion years ago.

1121
01:01:30.630 --> 01:01:34.380
So for a long time that the university just sort of coasting and slowing down

1122
01:01:34.381 --> 01:01:36.440
and then it turned on what's going to happen in the future,

1123
01:01:36.450 --> 01:01:38.550
they might turn around and make a big crunch.

1124
01:01:38.670 --> 01:01:41.160
So big crunch is still a possibility.
In fact,

1125
01:01:41.161 --> 01:01:45.660
there's a theory of space time called loop quantum gravity that says that maybe

1126
01:01:45.661 --> 01:01:49.200
all the spaces pixelated and these tiny tiny scale and it's specifically

1127
01:01:49.201 --> 01:01:52.890
predicts a big crunch.
So short answer is big crunch might still happen,

1128
01:01:53.010 --> 01:01:54.390
but nowhere in the near future.

1129
01:01:54.391 --> 01:01:56.820
So don't worry about it and you still have to pay next year's taxes.

1130
01:01:59.190 --> 01:02:00.930
But we know it.
Dark energy is such a mystery.

1131
01:02:00.931 --> 01:02:03.630
We can't predict what's going to happen because we don't understand the

1132
01:02:03.631 --> 01:02:04.800
mechanism for it at all.

1133
01:02:09.970 --> 01:02:13.150
<v 5>Um,
yeah,
thanks for doing this talk.
This is awesome.
Uh,</v>

1134
01:02:13.330 --> 01:02:15.490
so I think it's super important to have entertaining,

1135
01:02:15.491 --> 01:02:17.410
accessible examples of science,

1136
01:02:17.411 --> 01:02:20.100
especially for like young people to get them in stem and things

1137
01:02:20.100 --> 01:02:20.800
<v 6>like that.</v>

1138
01:02:20.800 --> 01:02:22.940
<v 4>Are there other,
um,
resources or</v>

1139
01:02:22.990 --> 01:02:25.470
<v 6>organizations that you know of and that you support that you think</v>

1140
01:02:25.780 --> 01:02:30.460
<v 4>are really good,
uh,
to point to or to support monetarily?</v>

1141
01:02:30.490 --> 01:02:33.970
Otherwise it's things like that.
Well,
first buy 10 copies of the book,

1142
01:02:34.820 --> 01:02:39.790
you can get them to young kids
or teenagers.
Uh,
it's a,

1143
01:02:39.791 --> 01:02:41.290
it's a,
it's a good question.
Um,

1144
01:02:41.620 --> 01:02:46.390
I agree that science communication is important.
Um,
and um,

1145
01:02:46.690 --> 01:02:51.670
in fact it was a Google that partially inspired this because I was reading

1146
01:02:51.700 --> 01:02:53.710
Google put out at science comic,
uh,

1147
01:02:53.711 --> 01:02:56.410
technical comic about the development of the chrome browser.

1148
01:02:56.620 --> 01:02:59.650
Scott McCloud did it and you know,
like how to write a browser.

1149
01:02:59.651 --> 01:03:03.460
It's not like the going to be the top telling the top selling story on the New

1150
01:03:03.460 --> 01:03:06.130
York Times,
but it was a really compelling a comic.

1151
01:03:06.131 --> 01:03:09.050
It was really well done in terms of communicating something technical.
Um,

1152
01:03:09.250 --> 01:03:12.460
and so I'm seeing more and more of this like collaborations between scientists

1153
01:03:12.461 --> 01:03:16.960
and and uh,
and artists.
And I think not all scientists are good communicators,

1154
01:03:17.020 --> 01:03:18.940
which is fine.
You don't have to be good at everything.

1155
01:03:19.300 --> 01:03:22.120
But the important thing is to pair up with somebody who's a good communicator

1156
01:03:22.240 --> 01:03:23.440
and has artistic skills.

1157
01:03:23.441 --> 01:03:27.760
And I hope to see more of that in the future in terms of supporting those
causes.

1158
01:03:28.540 --> 01:03:29.373
That's a good question.

1159
01:03:30.900 --> 01:03:31.830
<v 0>Um,
yeah,</v>

1160
01:03:31.831 --> 01:03:35.810
there's a bunch of like in youtube channels that are really good and explaining

1161
01:03:35.930 --> 01:03:39.060
the science and things like that and just a lot of comic artists online doing
it.

1162
01:03:39.061 --> 01:03:41.880
Also,
I think they did what Daniel was saying.

1163
01:03:42.540 --> 01:03:45.210
Did I agree with a lot is the idea that uh,

1164
01:03:45.420 --> 01:03:48.960
I mean you guys are the ones kind of making this technology and pushing the

1165
01:03:48.961 --> 01:03:52.380
boundaries of science and engineering.
Um,

1166
01:03:52.740 --> 01:03:55.550
and so I really liked the idea of,
uh,

1167
01:03:55.620 --> 01:03:59.100
people in those positions kind of taking the initiative to not just do the

1168
01:03:59.101 --> 01:04:04.101
research but also think creatively and figure out new ways to communicate this

1169
01:04:04.231 --> 01:04:07.730
stuff out to people.
I mean,
there's a lot of these examples now,
but you know,

1170
01:04:07.740 --> 01:04:11.040
tomorrow somebody could come up with a totally different type of collaboration

1171
01:04:11.041 --> 01:04:12.930
or,
or a way to communicate

1172
01:04:13.010 --> 01:04:17.330
<v 4>the stuff.
I saw a Higgs Boson dance performance once.</v>

1173
01:04:19.340 --> 01:04:21.410
I'm not sure I learned much about science,
but it was entertaining.

1174
01:04:34.190 --> 01:04:36.550
<v 6>Hello.
Are there any questions,
uh,</v>

1175
01:04:36.551 --> 01:04:41.330
that you cannot conceive of a possible answer to?
So,
uh,
you know,

1176
01:04:41.331 --> 01:04:45.020
with dark energy you could start making up theories tomorrow and none of them

1177
01:04:45.021 --> 01:04:48.590
would be particularly well founded.
They'd likely be wrong.
But you know,
it,

1178
01:04:48.770 --> 01:04:53.770
it seems to me like you can conceive of what the answer might look like.

1179
01:04:54.380 --> 01:04:56.810
Um,
are there any questions where that's not true?
So for me,

1180
01:04:56.811 --> 01:04:58.820
one maybe is consciousness,

1181
01:05:00.830 --> 01:05:05.750
<v 4>right?
So that's a great question.
A lot of the times the um,
we can speculate,</v>

1182
01:05:06.050 --> 01:05:10.640
but our speculation exceeds the bounds of science.
So one example is,
you know,

1183
01:05:10.641 --> 01:05:12.510
what happened before the Big Bang?
Well,

1184
01:05:12.511 --> 01:05:15.260
it may be that all the information about what happened for the Big Bang was

1185
01:05:15.261 --> 01:05:19.320
destroyed in the big bang.
Right?
Um,
I will run,
never know.
Um,

1186
01:05:19.450 --> 01:05:22.890
one possible when one popular theory of the Big Bang,

1187
01:05:23.080 --> 01:05:26.380
the big bang was one of many and there's an infinite number of universes that

1188
01:05:26.381 --> 01:05:27.214
we're all created,

1189
01:05:27.280 --> 01:05:30.610
but then an hour now are separated from each other and moving away from each

1190
01:05:30.611 --> 01:05:32.830
other fast and the speed of light.
So we will never detect them.

1191
01:05:33.400 --> 01:05:34.630
That kind of theory is fun,

1192
01:05:34.840 --> 01:05:39.250
but it's basically philosophy because you can't ever test it.
So yeah,

1193
01:05:39.251 --> 01:05:41.980
there are a lot of questions like what happened before the Big Bang where we can

1194
01:05:41.981 --> 01:05:45.700
have ideas but it's not clear we'll ever be able to test them.
However,

1195
01:05:46.090 --> 01:05:50.020
science is always moving forward and things that used to be philosophy
questions,

1196
01:05:50.170 --> 01:05:50.830
right,

1197
01:05:50.830 --> 01:05:54.370
are now science questions because we develop new technologies and new ideas and

1198
01:05:54.371 --> 01:05:57.880
new clever ways to test these subtle theories.
Um,

1199
01:05:58.150 --> 01:05:59.380
that question you raised,

1200
01:05:59.381 --> 01:06:02.200
what is consciousness is sort of a favorite one of mine.

1201
01:06:02.470 --> 01:06:06.490
It's one that I think will actually never be testable by science,
um,

1202
01:06:07.240 --> 01:06:09.160
because science assumes consciousness.

1203
01:06:09.420 --> 01:06:11.470
So you can never step outside of it to probe that.

1204
01:06:12.280 --> 01:06:15.490
But that's a whole other topic.
Yeah,
that's a great question.

1205
01:06:20.160 --> 01:06:23.460
Hi,
thanks for the great talk.
I,
so I have a question about,
uh,

1206
01:06:23.700 --> 01:06:25.470
so how do you think,
um,

1207
01:06:25.680 --> 01:06:29.340
software engineers can contribute to perhaps answering some of these questions

1208
01:06:29.341 --> 01:06:33.750
and also how do you see machine learning company coming into the picture?
Wow,

1209
01:06:34.140 --> 01:06:34.973
great question.

1210
01:06:35.010 --> 01:06:38.460
We're doing a lot of machine learning these days and particle physics and in

1211
01:06:38.461 --> 01:06:42.810
astronomy because we have larger and larger datasets and more and more subtle

1212
01:06:42.811 --> 01:06:43.970
signals.
Uh,

1213
01:06:43.980 --> 01:06:46.980
so actually one of the things I personally research is how to use machine

1214
01:06:46.981 --> 01:06:50.880
learning tools to solve,
um,
particle physics problems.
Uh,

1215
01:06:50.881 --> 01:06:54.930
one thing you guys can do is hire more particle physicists.
I,
for example,

1216
01:06:55.080 --> 01:06:58.770
can discover here is one of my students and you now he works here at Google,
uh,

1217
01:06:58.960 --> 01:07:01.190
to,
you know,
make more connections between these two fields.

1218
01:07:01.191 --> 01:07:04.860
Cause you guys have a lot of awesome hammers and I'm always frustrated when I

1219
01:07:04.861 --> 01:07:08.000
see,
for example,
like,
oh,
Facebook spent,
you know,

1220
01:07:08.010 --> 01:07:12.750
$100 million on this tool to identify somebody's face in a picture.
You know,

1221
01:07:12.751 --> 01:07:16.140
it's like so much money is being spent on what seems to be like trivial problems

1222
01:07:16.141 --> 01:07:19.380
like a,
is there a cat in this Internet video?
You know,

1223
01:07:19.381 --> 01:07:22.290
so many Phd thesis has been written on that question,
right?

1224
01:07:22.530 --> 01:07:26.550
Which is like a great example of like a hard question,
but like,
who cares?
Right?

1225
01:07:27.120 --> 01:07:30.270
And we have hard questions where we actually care about the answer.
You know,

1226
01:07:30.570 --> 01:07:34.260
what is dark matter?
Is this a Higgs Boson?
Yes or no,
right?
Um,

1227
01:07:34.380 --> 01:07:36.570
so just like talk to scientists,

1228
01:07:36.750 --> 01:07:39.870
try to get them to explain their problem to you in terms of their language and

1229
01:07:40.170 --> 01:07:43.230
teach them your language.
And I think you'll find a lot of interesting overlap.

1230
01:07:43.740 --> 01:07:48.360
Um,
yeah.
On a cool project is can I tell them to have a cave crayfish?
Dreyfus.

1231
01:07:48.650 --> 01:07:50.400
Uh,
yeah.
So for example,

1232
01:07:50.401 --> 01:07:54.870
one project I'm working on is trying to understand these cosmic rays by turning,

1233
01:07:54.910 --> 01:07:58.350
um,
everybody's smartphone into a particle detector.

1234
01:07:58.830 --> 01:08:01.260
And then if you network all of these smartphones together,

1235
01:08:01.440 --> 01:08:03.750
you can build a global size telescope,

1236
01:08:04.380 --> 01:08:07.440
which could look out into space and see where maybe where these cosmic rays are

1237
01:08:07.441 --> 01:08:11.550
coming from.
It's called crayfish cosmic race found in smartphones.

1238
01:08:11.970 --> 01:08:15.440
I'm Haniya,
we certainly need a software help for that project.

1239
01:08:15.441 --> 01:08:17.480
So if you're really interested,
send me an email.

1240
01:08:21.520 --> 01:08:25.640
Do I think dark matter is more important than cats in videos?

1241
01:08:26.030 --> 01:08:30.580
<v 2>Dark matter is cats and videos.
I think cats know something about dark matter.</v>

1242
01:08:30.581 --> 01:08:31.420
They're not telling us.

1243
01:08:37.450 --> 01:08:41.900
It seems like every time we we get closer and closer and you can get an

1244
01:08:41.901 --> 01:08:44.350
announcer.
He was like,
oh no,
we have dark matter.

1245
01:08:44.351 --> 01:08:48.160
And then when we went down there,
oh now we have their guarantee.
Um,

1246
01:08:48.190 --> 01:08:50.860
cause now you have your pie chart of 5% is us.

1247
01:08:50.861 --> 01:08:53.260
But it wouldn't be surprised if 50 years from now,
oh no,

1248
01:08:53.261 --> 01:08:56.710
now we have an another dark thing.
So dark power or whatever.

1249
01:08:56.930 --> 01:09:01.300
Or now we know like darks.
Yeah.
So also 0.1% of the universe.

1250
01:09:01.630 --> 01:09:04.870
And so this is a question that I don't think has an answer,

1251
01:09:04.871 --> 01:09:07.210
but do you expect that to continue happening?

1252
01:09:07.211 --> 01:09:10.980
Especially also the other way around.
So now we have three particles,

1253
01:09:10.990 --> 01:09:13.920
but I wouldn't be surprised that then we have one and the womb,

1254
01:09:13.930 --> 01:09:17.530
I whole wrath of infant with new particles and we have a new,

1255
01:09:17.800 --> 01:09:19.720
a new table of fundamental,

1256
01:09:19.721 --> 01:09:22.830
fundamental fundamental particles and we'd go go like all the weight,

1257
01:09:22.840 --> 01:09:26.380
rabbit hole upwards and no one said,
Hey,
I love your question.

1258
01:09:26.560 --> 01:09:30.970
<v 4>Um,
we express this question specifically in the book.
Okay.
The question is like,</v>

1259
01:09:31.040 --> 01:09:34.630
we'll,
could there ever be a theory of everything like Cooley ever understand the

1260
01:09:34.631 --> 01:09:39.280
universe?
So,
um,
I hope not because I like asking questions.

1261
01:09:39.670 --> 01:09:41.230
Um,
but there,

1262
01:09:41.290 --> 01:09:46.210
there are some arguments that the university might have a smallest particle.

1263
01:09:46.390 --> 01:09:48.550
So one way to interpret your question might be,

1264
01:09:48.910 --> 01:09:52.680
could we ever drill down and discover the smallest particle or is it just going

1265
01:09:52.681 --> 01:09:55.660
to keep going forever?
Smaller,
smaller,
smaller particles,
right.
Well,

1266
01:09:55.661 --> 01:09:56.494
we don't know,

1267
01:09:56.710 --> 01:10:01.580
but there are some arguments that suggest that the universe has a small s,
uh,

1268
01:10:01.740 --> 01:10:05.800
uh,
a distance scale beyond which you cannot measure the university's pixelated.

1269
01:10:05.801 --> 01:10:09.700
It's some smallest level,
but there is an end to this.
Um,

1270
01:10:09.730 --> 01:10:12.100
the arguments are pretty weak.
They go like this.

1271
01:10:12.430 --> 01:10:15.370
If I take all of these numbers that I found about the universe,

1272
01:10:15.400 --> 01:10:19.120
the speed of light,
Planck's,
constant,
Newton's gravitational constant,

1273
01:10:19.270 --> 01:10:21.280
and I multiply them together in this creative way,

1274
01:10:21.340 --> 01:10:24.940
I get a number that has units of distance.
Okay.

1275
01:10:25.600 --> 01:10:28.380
That's called the Planck length.
What does that number?
Well,

1276
01:10:28.381 --> 01:10:32.430
it's 10 to the minus 35 meters.
Really,
really small.
Uh,

1277
01:10:32.440 --> 01:10:36.910
does that mean the universe is pixelated?
No.
Does it mean if the is pixelated?

1278
01:10:36.911 --> 01:10:38.950
It's pixelated at that size?
No.

1279
01:10:39.280 --> 01:10:41.140
But what do we do in science when we don't know what to do?

1280
01:10:41.141 --> 01:10:43.210
We do the dumbest thing first.
So that was the dumbest thing.

1281
01:10:43.690 --> 01:10:47.320
So it's sort of a hand waving argument that may be at that scale or somewhere

1282
01:10:47.321 --> 01:10:49.330
within a factor of a million of that scale.

1283
01:10:49.480 --> 01:10:51.700
The universe might be pixelated at the smallest level,

1284
01:10:52.180 --> 01:10:57.130
but that scale if 10 of the 15 smaller than what we can currently see.

1285
01:10:57.490 --> 01:11:00.150
So we're really far away from ever seeing that.

1286
01:11:00.151 --> 01:11:04.090
I mean you have to build like a solar system size particle collider to study

1287
01:11:04.091 --> 01:11:05.350
things at that small scale.

1288
01:11:05.770 --> 01:11:09.070
So I think it's likely that the universe is pixelated.

1289
01:11:09.370 --> 01:11:12.340
Though I don't have any hard evidence for it and that eventually we can figure

1290
01:11:12.341 --> 01:11:16.230
that out.
But it's a long way from now.
Thank you.

1291
01:11:16.950 --> 01:11:20.700
Great question though.
I mean even if we had the theory of everything,

1292
01:11:20.790 --> 01:11:22.680
the questions don't stop cause,
and you've got to ask like,

1293
01:11:22.800 --> 01:11:25.260
why is there three in that theory?
What does that mean?
Right?

1294
01:11:25.440 --> 01:11:30.110
Then philosophy takes over.
Hey,
thank you for the talk.
It was awesome.
Uh,

1295
01:11:31.020 --> 01:11:31.591
quick question.

1296
01:11:31.591 --> 01:11:35.790
Don't you think the first person see the Grand Canyon would have lived hundreds

1297
01:11:35.790 --> 01:11:39.490
of thousands of years ago?
Not a few hundred.
Yeah,
probably.
Um,

1298
01:11:39.680 --> 01:11:43.260
I mean 10 or 20 thousands of years ago,
it's a migration down from,

1299
01:11:43.980 --> 01:11:47.640
I have a science related question to what do you think,
uh,

1300
01:11:47.700 --> 01:11:51.810
we're going to figure out first dark matter and dark energy or a unifying model

1301
01:11:51.811 --> 01:11:55.860
of gravity and electromagnetism.
Do we need one for the other?

1302
01:11:56.520 --> 01:11:59.120
What do you think?
Well,
that's a great question.
Um,

1303
01:11:59.550 --> 01:12:03.750
we could figure out dark matter anytime in the next few years.
It's possible.

1304
01:12:03.990 --> 01:12:05.940
We're looking for dark matter very actively.

1305
01:12:06.120 --> 01:12:08.640
We're trying to create it in the lab by smashing particles together.

1306
01:12:08.880 --> 01:12:13.110
We're trying,
we have these big tanks of heavy water and just underground,
um,

1307
01:12:13.260 --> 01:12:16.980
that are looking for dark matter so we could discover it any moment,
right?

1308
01:12:17.100 --> 01:12:18.900
Or because keep looking for it and not find it.

1309
01:12:19.200 --> 01:12:22.920
So dark matter is the most likely thing to be discovered the next few years,

1310
01:12:23.130 --> 01:12:26.100
but also could be decades dark energy.

1311
01:12:26.490 --> 01:12:29.940
It's pretty exciting because it's such a big question.
Um,

1312
01:12:30.390 --> 01:12:33.660
and do we can make progress on that really unpredictably?
Uh,

1313
01:12:33.690 --> 01:12:34.680
it could be a long time,

1314
01:12:35.100 --> 01:12:38.970
a unifying theory of gravity and the other forces people that we're working on

1315
01:12:38.971 --> 01:12:42.270
that for decades and made very little progress.

1316
01:12:42.570 --> 01:12:46.650
So I don't expect that to be wrapped up anytime soon unless we could visit a

1317
01:12:46.651 --> 01:12:48.630
black hole and look inside of it.

1318
01:12:48.960 --> 01:12:53.460
Because inside a black hole is all the data we need to understand,
um,

1319
01:12:53.580 --> 01:12:55.830
why we don't have a grab a quantum theory of gravity.

1320
01:12:56.040 --> 01:12:59.250
If you've seen the movie interstellar,
that part of that movie was actually true.

1321
01:13:01.830 --> 01:13:06.810
The rest
we have no idea.
No idea.

1322
01:13:07.590 --> 01:13:09.150
Great question.
All right.

1323
01:13:09.151 --> 01:13:12.230
Well I think we're going to wrap up the Q and a now and then,
uh,

1324
01:13:12.350 --> 01:13:17.350
Daniel and Jorge will be signing books and answering any lingering questions for

1325
01:13:17.491 --> 01:13:21.830
the next while.
Thanks everybody.
Yeah,
thank you.
