1
00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.590
Thank you so much for the kind introduction and for being here today.

2
00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.610
Um,
I hope you saw the large stack of books and that you can grab one on your way

3
00:00:20.611 --> 00:00:23.580
out if you feel so inclined.
Um,

4
00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.340
so I'll be introducing with 20 minutes of history,
but is Eileen indicated,

5
00:00:29.341 --> 00:00:34.341
I think this will have significance for how we talk about autism and Asperger

6
00:00:34.781 --> 00:00:36.710
Syndrome today and it,

7
00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.740
this book has already gotten quite a bit of a conversation going with society's

8
00:00:40.741 --> 00:00:45.741
renaming themselves and conversation online with people who have self identified

9
00:00:46.111 --> 00:00:47.840
with Asperger's.
Um,

10
00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:51.600
so I hope we can get to bigger questions of neuro diversity through this.

11
00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.310
One of the things that we can all agree on is that um,

12
00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.970
Hans aspergers idea of autism took hold in the 1990s.

13
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.150
The diagnostic criteria were expanded,

14
00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:06.720
so for decades,
sorry about that.

15
00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.880
We in the United States went by the American Leo Kanner's definition of autism

16
00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.250
and his idea of autism,
which was much narrower than how we understand it today.

17
00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:21.630
Kanner was looking at children who were relatively similar to one another.

18
00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:24.960
They tended to have more severe cognitive impairments.

19
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.450
They were less verbal or nonverbal.

20
00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.510
And Asperger had a much broader idea of autism.

21
00:01:30.511 --> 00:01:33.450
And he included children with milder challenges,

22
00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:38.190
which is one of the reasons behind this increase in diagnosis.

23
00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.260
So Asperger to take you back to the turn of the century,

24
00:01:43.261 --> 00:01:47.520
was born in 1906 and how spring 50 miles outside of Vienna.

25
00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.980
He left home at age 19.

26
00:01:49.981 --> 00:01:54.981
Very precocious for medical studies at the University of Vienna in Vienna was a

27
00:01:55.681 --> 00:01:58.110
cultural capital of Europe at this time,

28
00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.560
but it also fell after World War One and to political and economic crises in

29
00:02:04.441 --> 00:02:07.860
street children flooded Vienna's institutions.

30
00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:12.270
There were a number of orphans from the war and just thousands of children

31
00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.250
destitute and the need of help.

32
00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:20.250
So you have a very progressive welfare system that gets developed in Vienna to

33
00:02:20.251 --> 00:02:21.240
help these children,

34
00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.560
including leak leading psycho analysis and psychiatrists who get involved.

35
00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:30.560
You can see Sigmund and Anna Freud there who do a lot of volunteer work at this

36
00:02:30.661 --> 00:02:31.494
time.

37
00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.570
So Asperger becomes part of the circle.
Um,

38
00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.900
he goes to work at the University of Vienna Children's Hospital in 1931 and he

39
00:02:43.861 --> 00:02:48.420
was one of the first hires by France hamburger and he was part of this effort to

40
00:02:48.421 --> 00:02:52.920
help v and V and these children in need.
France hamburger,

41
00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.100
however,
was on the far right of the political spectrum.

42
00:02:56.101 --> 00:03:01.101
He joined the Nazi party quite early and had his reputation as a real radical

43
00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:06.810
and Humberg or began purging the esteemed faculty of the University of Vienna

44
00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:09.280
Children's hospital.
Um,

45
00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:14.310
predominantly Jews and liberals and hiring people on the far right instead.

46
00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:16.900
And Asperger was one of hamburgers.

47
00:03:16.901 --> 00:03:21.040
First hires and Asperger had solid right,
um,

48
00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:26.080
credentials being members of anti liberal,
anti-socialist,

49
00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:29.350
anti modern and antisemitic organizations.

50
00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:34.030
And Hamburger promoted Asperger very quickly at a very young age.

51
00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:35.320
At Age 28,

52
00:03:35.321 --> 00:03:40.060
he was named the Head of the curative education clinic over the heads of

53
00:03:40.061 --> 00:03:42.790
longtime staffers who had worked there for decades.

54
00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:49.240
So please bear with me.
I love this chart,
although it's a lot to absorb,

55
00:03:49.241 --> 00:03:53.880
but let me just break it down.
You can see these thin lines.
This is a,

56
00:03:53.881 --> 00:03:58.881
a network graph and intellectual network graph of relationships between V and

57
00:03:59.011 --> 00:04:01.900
e's,
um,
psychiatrists and psychoanalysis.

58
00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:05.380
Vienna really was the cradle of psycho analysis at this time.

59
00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:09.600
And so you can see the people with big letters,
um,

60
00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:11.890
are the real nodes in this connection.

61
00:04:11.891 --> 00:04:16.891
And here you have the liberal Jewish psychoanalysis whose names you would know,

62
00:04:17.171 --> 00:04:20.380
right Anna,
Freud's,
Sigmund Freud and their associates.

63
00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:23.020
And then you have Asperger,
the young man,

64
00:04:23.021 --> 00:04:27.550
that picture there and hamburger who are really off on the periphery of

65
00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:30.130
mainstream psychoanalysis.

66
00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:35.200
And they were considered kind of crackpots by the people whose names we would

67
00:04:35.201 --> 00:04:38.830
most respect today.
And so what happened during the Third Reich,

68
00:04:38.831 --> 00:04:42.910
and what I'll be talking about is these guys are all forced out of their

69
00:04:42.911 --> 00:04:46.210
positions and they emigrate to the United States in the UK.

70
00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:51.450
And Asperger's branch of psychiatry comes to the fore because it has real Nazi

71
00:04:51.731 --> 00:04:52.660
resonances.

72
00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:59.010
And so what this slide also shows is this is happening in the thirties before

73
00:04:59.051 --> 00:05:00.820
the Nazis Annex Vienna.

74
00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:05.770
And so VN is political and social split in the sciences,

75
00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:10.800
predates the advent of Nazi ism and formal politics.

76
00:05:11.741 --> 00:05:16.000
In Vienna,
people are already doing this.
Okay.

77
00:05:16.001 --> 00:05:19.780
So what did aspergers branch of Psychiatry believe?

78
00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:25.630
The child psychiatrist he was hanging out with were diagnosing children who they

79
00:05:25.631 --> 00:05:27.820
said lacked social spirit,

80
00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:33.430
who they were unable to participate in group activities such as the Hitler
youth.

81
00:05:33.431 --> 00:05:37.420
And they would even consult for organizations like the Hitler youth or League of

82
00:05:37.421 --> 00:05:42.421
German girls trying to get these kids to be more social and feel I'm part of the

83
00:05:42.761 --> 00:05:44.890
collective over the individual.

84
00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:50.340
So Paul Schroeder on the upper left is really the father of Nazi psychiatry and

85
00:05:50.561 --> 00:05:53.890
he called this readiness to serve the community.

86
00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:58.340
And the word he used was [inaudible],
which is one German.
Um,

87
00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:01.940
the famously untranslatable words in German.
Um,

88
00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:06.740
but in the 18th century it meant something like soul.
Um,

89
00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:10.650
and then Nazi psychiatrist added the social dimension.

90
00:06:10.651 --> 00:06:14.510
So it's really kind of a metaphysical connection that I'm feeling with the

91
00:06:14.511 --> 00:06:17.510
audience right now.
We're sharing and some higher spirit.

92
00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:21.650
And so this was this idea of good moot and um,

93
00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:23.660
this was important in the Nazi state.

94
00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:29.440
The state really aimed for this purified homogenous folk that was not about

95
00:06:30.321 --> 00:06:34.970
conformity.
It was about fascist feeling.
It was about togetherness.

96
00:06:34.971 --> 00:06:39.740
It was about a shared purpose and grew moot,
would take you beyond conformity.

97
00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:42.080
So,
um,

98
00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:47.140
Hans Hind set worked with Schroeder Asperger in turned with both of them.

99
00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:52.600
Hans Hindsa would go on to become one of the top three individuals involved in

100
00:06:52.731 --> 00:06:54.860
the murder of disabled children and the right.

101
00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:58.890
And so very early on in 1934,
um,

102
00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:03.970
Asperger is working with these guys and being infused with their ideas.

103
00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:08.390
So the other people pictured here,
I won't go through them,
but just trust me.

104
00:07:08.391 --> 00:07:12.740
They all wrote about good mood and they started to diagnose children who lacked

105
00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:14.500
gumboot.
And um,

106
00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:18.680
they started publishing articles in the thirties long before Asperger every book

107
00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:23.120
ever published and they would diagnose children's percent of good moods and the

108
00:07:23.121 --> 00:07:24.600
heritability of gumboot.

109
00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:29.620
And they had a whole vocabulary around children's social spirit and even through

110
00:07:29.961 --> 00:07:32.510
around the word autism,
um,

111
00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:35.510
as meaning community averse and weak.

112
00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:40.460
And so my point here is really to say that the idea of autism predated

113
00:07:40.461 --> 00:07:45.140
Asperger's work.
It was already in the air of Nazi psychiatry.

114
00:07:47.770 --> 00:07:52.770
So now we're in March of 1938 in the Nazis roll in to Vienna on March 13th.

115
00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:59.440
And Asperger witnessed tremendous change immediately at the University of
Vienna,

116
00:07:59.890 --> 00:08:04.000
the medical school removed 78% of its faculty,

117
00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:06.580
predominantly Jews.
And remember,

118
00:08:06.581 --> 00:08:09.850
hamburger at the children's hospital had already purged all the Jews.

119
00:08:09.851 --> 00:08:12.780
So this is on top of what had been happening.
Um,

120
00:08:12.790 --> 00:08:17.500
including three Nobel prize winners,
Asperger and hamburgers.

121
00:08:17.590 --> 00:08:22.540
A clinic went through the purchase unscathed because they had already

122
00:08:22.541 --> 00:08:26.110
voluntarily purge.
They're liberals and they're Jews.
And in fact,

123
00:08:26.111 --> 00:08:30.340
as I showed you on the chart with this purge of 78% of the faculty at the

124
00:08:30.341 --> 00:08:33.190
University Get van,
now they had greater opportunities.

125
00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:37.490
Okay.
So I hate texts slides,
but,

126
00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:42.200
but bear with me cause I think this is important.
So for Asperger,

127
00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:43.200
<v 1>okay,</v>

128
00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:46.740
<v 0>creating a diagnosis was a new professional opportunity.</v>

129
00:08:47.190 --> 00:08:51.720
So 1937,
one year before the Nazi annexation,
he wrote,

130
00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:54.360
um,
he didn't believe in diagnosing children.

131
00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:57.960
There is approaches is there are different personalities.

132
00:08:57.990 --> 00:09:02.990
It is impossible to establish a rigid set of criteria for a diagnosis.

133
00:09:03.390 --> 00:09:06.540
So we need to appreciate the uniqueness of children,
right?

134
00:09:06.541 --> 00:09:07.650
We can't diagnose them.

135
00:09:09.140 --> 00:09:09.940
<v 1>Then</v>

136
00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:12.850
<v 0>just a few months after the Nazis roll into Vienna,</v>

137
00:09:13.090 --> 00:09:15.490
Asperger introduced his own diagnosis.

138
00:09:15.790 --> 00:09:19.420
This is a well characterized group of children,
right?

139
00:09:19.450 --> 00:09:23.770
Well characterized who we name autistic psychopaths because the confinement of

140
00:09:23.771 --> 00:09:27.550
the self has led to a narrowing of relations to their environment.

141
00:09:28.210 --> 00:09:32.350
So what's striking here is Asperger calls autism,
a psychopathy,

142
00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:33.340
um,

143
00:09:33.340 --> 00:09:38.340
which really carries connotations and German psychiatry of criminality and

144
00:09:38.921 --> 00:09:39.880
depravity.

145
00:09:40.210 --> 00:09:44.560
And you're going to grow up to like roam the streets and talk to yourself.
It's,

146
00:09:44.561 --> 00:09:49.120
it's something that you can't cure and you're,
um,
yeah,

147
00:09:49.121 --> 00:09:52.360
you're like,
uh,
uh,
yeah,
a social on the street.

148
00:09:52.361 --> 00:09:55.570
And so it has a bit of a different meaning than it does in English.

149
00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:58.090
And this is a well characterized group of children.

150
00:09:58.091 --> 00:10:02.260
So he's really changed his tone within a very short period of time.

151
00:10:03.130 --> 00:10:05.590
At the same time,
he's changing his tone.

152
00:10:05.591 --> 00:10:09.760
He joins a number of Nazi organizations in quick succession,

153
00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:14.050
and he also begins to consult for the juvenile justice system.

154
00:10:14.050 --> 00:10:17.680
You might imagine the Nazi justice system is not terribly lenient toward

155
00:10:17.681 --> 00:10:18.850
nonconformist children.

156
00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:22.360
And he also begins to work for the city's remedial schools.

157
00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:26.020
So Asperger did not join the Nazi party.

158
00:10:26.770 --> 00:10:30.310
And this is a reason why he has been,
as Aileen mentioned,

159
00:10:30.311 --> 00:10:34.750
lionized in the history as a resistor of Nazi-ism,
um,

160
00:10:34.810 --> 00:10:38.080
is I show in my book,
this was not a big deal.

161
00:10:38.110 --> 00:10:42.040
Only three and 10 physicians in Vienna joined the Nazi party.

162
00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:46.150
So a small minority joined the Nazi party.
Um,

163
00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:50.980
and he was closely affiliated with hamburger and other individuals that

164
00:10:51.070 --> 00:10:53.890
protected him politically.
He didn't need to join the Nazi party.

165
00:10:53.891 --> 00:10:56.260
He was a member of all these other organizations

166
00:10:57.790 --> 00:11:02.110
and he would soon begin to work at the eye of the storm of the euthanasia

167
00:11:02.111 --> 00:11:04.630
program.
Okay.

168
00:11:04.631 --> 00:11:07.600
So this is where the talk becomes difficult.

169
00:11:08.170 --> 00:11:12.120
Just trigger warnings I need to do with my work.
Um,

170
00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:16.330
but I'm now going to talk about the Nazi program of child euthanasia and that's

171
00:11:16.331 --> 00:11:19.870
their term.
Um,
which is really a misnomer.

172
00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:24.640
These children were neither terminally ill nor suffering,

173
00:11:25.330 --> 00:11:25.870
<v 1>okay?</v>

174
00:11:25.870 --> 00:11:29.020
<v 0>They were just deemed to have mental or physical defects.</v>

175
00:11:29.380 --> 00:11:32.860
And this was the Reich's first program of mass extermination.

176
00:11:32.861 --> 00:11:37.861
It predated the murder of Jews and Sinti and Roma and slobs and other groups.

177
00:11:38.380 --> 00:11:42.640
Um,
and it was designed to become a permanent part of the healthcare system.

178
00:11:43.390 --> 00:11:46.900
Unlike these other forms of mass extermination that were more war time

179
00:11:46.901 --> 00:11:50.080
operations.
This was a deliberative scientific process.

180
00:11:50.470 --> 00:11:52.110
And the idea was to rid the,

181
00:11:52.190 --> 00:11:57.190
the state of who would be a drain economically and a danger to its gene pool.

182
00:11:58.980 --> 00:12:02.230
Um,
so at least 5,000 children perished,

183
00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:07.560
which is a very small number compared to the indiscriminate killing killing of

184
00:12:07.931 --> 00:12:09.760
other groups.
But in my mind,

185
00:12:09.761 --> 00:12:13.810
this is even the smallness of the number is what makes it so scary because it's

186
00:12:13.811 --> 00:12:18.580
so deliberative.
Doctors were going through these case files in,
you know,

187
00:12:18.581 --> 00:12:23.230
excessive detail and passing them on.
And it was,
it was a scientific process.

188
00:12:23.230 --> 00:12:27.370
You were judging children as individually worthless,
worthless or worthy.

189
00:12:28.460 --> 00:12:33.130
There are around 37 children's wards dotted inside the right.

190
00:12:33.190 --> 00:12:35.830
This is not out somewhere in Poland or eastern Europe.

191
00:12:35.831 --> 00:12:40.270
This is inside communities.
And this is Spiegel grinned in Vienna,

192
00:12:40.520 --> 00:12:42.430
um,
which is right outside.

193
00:12:42.460 --> 00:12:46.800
You can take tram number 47 and still get there.
And um,

194
00:12:46.810 --> 00:12:50.260
it's one of the deadliest,
we're almost 800 children were killed.

195
00:12:51.700 --> 00:12:56.200
So in contrast to the,
our mechanized images of the Holocaust,

196
00:12:56.201 --> 00:12:57.790
I think euthanasia is,

197
00:12:58.330 --> 00:13:02.500
has been overlooked and it's important to understand its dimensions.

198
00:13:02.890 --> 00:13:07.630
It involved intimate killing by the doctors and nurses that saw these children

199
00:13:07.631 --> 00:13:10.030
every day.
They knew their names,
they fed them,

200
00:13:10.031 --> 00:13:12.550
they change their sheets and women,

201
00:13:13.060 --> 00:13:17.740
this is the only program of extermination that really relied on women killings

202
00:13:17.741 --> 00:13:18.221
were done.

203
00:13:18.221 --> 00:13:23.221
And the youth's own beds is staff would issue overdoses of barbiturates until

204
00:13:23.501 --> 00:13:26.830
the children grew ill and died,
usually have pneumonia.

205
00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:30.760
And a ton of people knew this was going on.

206
00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:35.180
There were protests outside of Spiegel grown.
They were rumors published,
um,

207
00:13:35.350 --> 00:13:38.500
that were being denied in the newspapers.
Um,

208
00:13:38.950 --> 00:13:40.480
but people had different opinions.

209
00:13:40.481 --> 00:13:44.020
Some parents would actually deliver their children to the killing center and

210
00:13:44.021 --> 00:13:47.480
request that their child be put to death.
Um,

211
00:13:47.950 --> 00:13:50.950
the doctors were sort of offended at this because this was supposed to be a

212
00:13:50.951 --> 00:13:54.640
scientific process and it was supposed to be the doctors that decided and so

213
00:13:54.641 --> 00:13:59.380
they would not on our parental wishes to put a child to death.
But um,

214
00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:02.950
yeah,
there you go.
Okay.

215
00:14:02.951 --> 00:14:06.070
So where has Asperger in this program?
Well,

216
00:14:06.071 --> 00:14:10.750
you've see me flash up hamburger who was a zealous,
um,
supporter of the program.

217
00:14:10.751 --> 00:14:14.980
He transferred numerous children to Schmiegel grunt is head of the children's

218
00:14:14.981 --> 00:14:15.814
hospital.

219
00:14:16.060 --> 00:14:21.060
This is Max Gundel who's the city counselor on the board of Spiegel grunt.

220
00:14:21.571 --> 00:14:25.840
He's the municipal director of Spiegel grunt.
This is air when you,
Kelly is,

221
00:14:25.841 --> 00:14:28.120
who's the head doctor of speak Okrent.

222
00:14:28.390 --> 00:14:33.390
And so Asperger co founded the Vienna Society for Curative Education With these

223
00:14:34.781 --> 00:14:38.970
three guys.
He worked very closely with them.
So close with you Kelly,

224
00:14:38.980 --> 00:14:39.880
if to the regime,

225
00:14:39.881 --> 00:14:44.881
I don't know if you can recognize this woman if she resembles eight off,

226
00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:49.120
that's his sister Paula Hitler.
Yeah.

227
00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:54.410
Hitler apparently disapproved of the match because he didn't want his daughter

228
00:14:54.411 --> 00:14:59.411
marrying a mass murder and had him arrested in a trip to Berlin by the Gestapo.

229
00:15:00.740 --> 00:15:02.990
And sent off to the eastern front,

230
00:15:03.590 --> 00:15:05.900
which is a handy way to get rid of a brother in law.

231
00:15:05.901 --> 00:15:09.200
You don't want the time of course.
So,

232
00:15:10.730 --> 00:15:11.563
um,

233
00:15:12.110 --> 00:15:17.110
Asperger publicly called for the transfer of children to speak old grunt.

234
00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:23.500
So this is a talk he gave that was re published in the Munich medical weekly it

235
00:15:23.651 --> 00:15:27.560
prestigious journal saying that quote for all difficult cases,

236
00:15:27.561 --> 00:15:30.710
only a long and continuous observation as proper,

237
00:15:30.950 --> 00:15:35.360
like those carried out in his own clinic or the reformatory Spico grunt.

238
00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:39.650
And he followed his own advice.
Uh,

239
00:15:39.710 --> 00:15:44.270
he were two girls who he transferred to speak old Grund two and a half year old

240
00:15:44.271 --> 00:15:47.270
heritage Kleiber.
She was the youngest of nine children,

241
00:15:47.570 --> 00:15:50.810
was severely disabled by meningitis and Diptheria.

242
00:15:51.140 --> 00:15:53.030
Asperger concluded the quote,

243
00:15:53.031 --> 00:15:58.031
her accommodation and Spiegel grunt is absolutely necessary here to his mother

244
00:15:58.731 --> 00:16:01.700
reportedly told the presiding Dr it Spiegel grunt.

245
00:16:02.030 --> 00:16:05.960
If the child could not be helped,
perhaps it would be better if she should die,

246
00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:08.920
as she would have nothing in this world anyway,

247
00:16:09.730 --> 00:16:13.810
hair to did die two months after aspergers transfer.
Um,

248
00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:17.780
and one wonders if the mother's wishes played a role in Asperger's.

249
00:16:17.781 --> 00:16:22.340
Thinking because theirs are numerous cases where if the mother's overburdened at

250
00:16:22.341 --> 00:16:25.460
home and has a disabled child and is unable to cope,

251
00:16:25.461 --> 00:16:29.780
he would follow the wishes and institutionalize the child.
Um,

252
00:16:29.810 --> 00:16:33.000
so five year old Elizabeth,
um,

253
00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:38.060
he transferred to speak of grunge.
She could speak only a single word Mama,

254
00:16:38.810 --> 00:16:42.290
the nurse,
it's Spiegel going wrote,
she has a friendly nature,

255
00:16:42.291 --> 00:16:46.910
is very affectionate and flattering with caregivers.
If she is treated strictly,

256
00:16:46.911 --> 00:16:48.920
she will cry and hug the nurse.

257
00:16:50.300 --> 00:16:53.080
She was killed four months after she was admitted to Spiegel.

258
00:16:53.081 --> 00:16:54.890
GRUND and her brain harvested,

259
00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:59.640
kept with the collection of over 400 children's brains in the cellar of speak.

260
00:16:59.641 --> 00:17:04.130
Speakable grunt.
So this is also context.

261
00:17:04.131 --> 00:17:08.840
Meanwhile aspergers working on autism.
Okay,

262
00:17:08.841 --> 00:17:12.590
so remember in 1937 he wrote,

263
00:17:12.591 --> 00:17:16.370
it's impossible to establish a diagnosis.
Then a year later,

264
00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:17.690
1938,

265
00:17:17.691 --> 00:17:21.920
he comes out with his own diagnosis and it uses neutral language.

266
00:17:21.921 --> 00:17:26.570
It says this is a confinement of the self,
a narrowing of relations.

267
00:17:26.571 --> 00:17:30.230
That's,
that's kind of neutral language,
although he does call them psychopaths.

268
00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:34.440
So as time passes,
he begins to adapt,
uh,

269
00:17:34.700 --> 00:17:36.680
assume more fascist language.

270
00:17:37.100 --> 00:17:42.100
So in 1940 he defines a group of abnormal children who we refer to as autistic

271
00:17:42.861 --> 00:17:46.730
psychopaths.
These loaner children fall out of every community.

272
00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:51.120
They live their own lives without emotional relationship to the environment.

273
00:17:51.121 --> 00:17:54.000
They also react abnormally to the needs of the environment.

274
00:17:54.300 --> 00:17:57.600
So basically his language has become more normative,
right?

275
00:17:57.601 --> 00:17:58.770
These are abnormal children.

276
00:17:58.771 --> 00:18:03.510
They're behaving abnormal and he's more concerned with social connectedness,

277
00:18:03.540 --> 00:18:07.530
right?
He calls them loners,
they don't have an emotional attachment.

278
00:18:08.340 --> 00:18:12.920
So he's shifted a bit.
Then in 1944,

279
00:18:12.921 --> 00:18:17.000
this is a seminal treatise that is cited today on autism.

280
00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:21.530
And this is his post doctoral thesis that he wrote for promotion.

281
00:18:22.190 --> 00:18:23.030
At this time,

282
00:18:23.031 --> 00:18:27.890
the children's hospital was really desperate to promote people because remember

283
00:18:27.891 --> 00:18:30.020
the purge of liberal and Jewish faculty.

284
00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:34.970
So he was sort of put up through the ranks even though his thesis was really a

285
00:18:34.971 --> 00:18:39.350
rush job.
And if you read it now,
it's,
it's remarkable that it passed for science.

286
00:18:39.950 --> 00:18:40.460
Um,

287
00:18:40.460 --> 00:18:45.460
but he wrote the artist is only himself and not an active member of the greater

288
00:18:45.921 --> 00:18:50.360
organism,
which he is influenced by in which he influences constantly.

289
00:18:51.050 --> 00:18:51.321
Okay.

290
00:18:51.321 --> 00:18:55.730
So here we have members and greater organisms and I mean this is fully fascist

291
00:18:55.731 --> 00:18:57.650
language,
right?
Um,

292
00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:02.420
and he becomes more and more concerned with aptitude for community here.

293
00:19:02.750 --> 00:19:06.960
And then later in the thesis he adopts Nazi Psychiatry's,
um,

294
00:19:07.010 --> 00:19:10.370
central tenant of gumboot.
He'd never written about Kahoot before,

295
00:19:10.371 --> 00:19:14.970
but now he's up for promotion.
There's good mood here.
We are in he,
um,

296
00:19:15.740 --> 00:19:20.740
so my argument is that basically autism was conceived as the psychological

297
00:19:21.051 --> 00:19:22.610
opposite of Nazi-ism,

298
00:19:23.420 --> 00:19:24.253
<v 1>right?</v>

299
00:19:24.860 --> 00:19:29.860
<v 0>That it's children who lack the capacity for fascism and Asperger who is fluent</v>

300
00:19:30.111 --> 00:19:34.610
in both Greek and Latin might have had this in mind as fast yo is the bundle or

301
00:19:34.611 --> 00:19:38.840
the group in autos is the self turned inward.

302
00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:45.970
So Asperger did prize,

303
00:19:45.971 --> 00:19:50.020
one of the reasons he has this reputation today is valuing children with

304
00:19:50.021 --> 00:19:53.800
disabilities is because he said some were superhuman,
right.

305
00:19:53.801 --> 00:19:56.080
And we kind of have this idea of,
you know,

306
00:19:56.081 --> 00:20:01.081
Asperger's today is people can press possess these savant powers and um,

307
00:20:01.151 --> 00:20:06.090
are really remarkable.
And Asperger did prize the special abilities,
um,

308
00:20:06.230 --> 00:20:10.690
in math and other technical subjects and said they were at the quote favorable.

309
00:20:10.691 --> 00:20:13.810
And if an autistic range,
um,

310
00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:18.040
he held a highly gendered view of this and declaring that the artistic

311
00:20:18.041 --> 00:20:21.700
personality is an extreme variant of male intelligence,

312
00:20:22.090 --> 00:20:24.460
of the male character.
Um,

313
00:20:24.520 --> 00:20:27.580
and this is echoing the gender stereotypes of the day,

314
00:20:27.581 --> 00:20:31.420
saying the boys had a gift for logical thinking for abstraction,

315
00:20:31.630 --> 00:20:34.600
whereas girls were more for the concrete and practical.

316
00:20:35.110 --> 00:20:37.780
And he said in over 200 cases of autism,

317
00:20:37.781 --> 00:20:42.580
he had never seen a case in girls ever.
This was a male characteristic.

318
00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:44.970
He did say after the war,
um,

319
00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:48.670
while there were no female cases in Austria and the United States,

320
00:20:48.671 --> 00:20:52.990
there were some cars,
girls had become more masculinized in the United States.

321
00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:56.510
<v 2>Yeah.
Um,</v>

322
00:20:56.950 --> 00:21:01.720
<v 0>so Asperger believe that many of the boys could be remediated if they received</v>

323
00:21:01.721 --> 00:21:03.250
intensive help and therapy.

324
00:21:03.251 --> 00:21:08.050
These were boys that were worth reclaiming for the national community and he was

325
00:21:08.051 --> 00:21:12.280
far more dismissive of girls who showed the same traits and they were sent to

326
00:21:12.281 --> 00:21:13.780
correctional facilities.

327
00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:19.060
So I went through some of the case files of these children have boys and girls

328
00:21:19.061 --> 00:21:24.040
who were described in the same terms and met opposite fates.
Um,

329
00:21:24.070 --> 00:21:27.070
so Fritz for example,
fell out of the community.

330
00:21:27.310 --> 00:21:29.740
It was impossible to get him to play in a group.

331
00:21:29.890 --> 00:21:34.240
His eye gaze one was mostly into state space.

332
00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:36.880
Horrow would never play with others.

333
00:21:37.150 --> 00:21:40.600
These were sort of a clinic notes written on these boys,

334
00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:44.560
but in his treatise,
and we know this from his case files,

335
00:21:44.740 --> 00:21:49.210
he treated these boys with genuine care and kindness and employed a lot of

336
00:21:49.211 --> 00:21:50.770
therapies we use today.

337
00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:54.220
This is also why aspergers considered very progressive.

338
00:21:54.221 --> 00:21:58.810
He gets his clinic engaged in play,
therapy's and drama and music.

339
00:21:59.260 --> 00:22:01.900
Um,
he believed in giving children,
um,

340
00:22:01.901 --> 00:22:06.160
special aids at school and special tutoring and you know,

341
00:22:06.161 --> 00:22:11.100
one on one.
Um,
kind of what we consider play play therapy,
um,

342
00:22:11.260 --> 00:22:13.870
for boys who were deemed to have potential.

343
00:22:14.940 --> 00:22:15.370
<v 2>Okay.</v>

344
00:22:15.370 --> 00:22:18.520
<v 0>Sit here.
Some files of girls that I found.
Um,</v>

345
00:22:18.550 --> 00:22:22.810
Christine Burka was quote,
difficult to influence from the outside.

346
00:22:23.050 --> 00:22:26.590
She was closed,
inhibited,
hard to reach.
Um,

347
00:22:26.620 --> 00:22:29.470
you can see her clinic note,
they're kind commute,

348
00:22:30.130 --> 00:22:32.270
<v 2>no good.
Um,</v>

349
00:22:34.390 --> 00:22:39.010
<v 0>and then you can see his official diagnosis of Christine is not as psych is not</v>

350
00:22:39.011 --> 00:22:43.030
a psychiatric diagnosis,
but it's a character variant.

351
00:22:43.090 --> 00:22:46.220
This is his handwriting.
He was born left handed,

352
00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:51.790
but then was forced to be right handed.
So it's terrible.
Um,
the poor historian,

353
00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:55.210
um,
he,
she was egocentric,
vulgar,

354
00:22:55.211 --> 00:22:59.800
oppositional and underhanded,
and she was sent to a correctional institution.

355
00:22:59.801 --> 00:23:02.440
She did not receive the kind of care of the boys.

356
00:23:02.441 --> 00:23:07.210
Did Al Frieda and Margarita faced even worse faiths,

357
00:23:07.630 --> 00:23:11.530
um,
again,
describing them in the same language as the is the boys,

358
00:23:11.531 --> 00:23:12.520
he called autistic.

359
00:23:12.521 --> 00:23:17.020
He said that Margarita did not participate at all in the community of children.

360
00:23:17.380 --> 00:23:20.110
Her facial expression was remarkably empty.

361
00:23:20.350 --> 00:23:22.930
She would stare and passively before her.
Again,

362
00:23:22.931 --> 00:23:27.400
I could just read all these quotes,
same characteristics given to Alfreda.

363
00:23:28.270 --> 00:23:32.710
So here's what happened to them.
Kelly is,

364
00:23:32.711 --> 00:23:37.711
remember Paula Hitler's fiance visited Asperger's clinic and she was transferred

365
00:23:38.171 --> 00:23:41.470
the same day.
Margarita was introduced to your Kelly's,
um,

366
00:23:41.580 --> 00:23:44.680
al Frieda was sent to obtain Thailand.
Dr Elink,

367
00:23:44.710 --> 00:23:48.350
that's the killing pavilion and speak old grunt.

368
00:23:48.740 --> 00:23:52.790
So those are the fates that El Frieda hands Margarita faced.

369
00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:54.860
Even though they manifested,
I mean,

370
00:23:54.861 --> 00:23:57.980
we can't say that these girls look like the boys,
right?
But he,

371
00:23:57.981 --> 00:24:02.210
they are marking similar symptoms and they're having opposite fates.

372
00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:09.410
So Asperger not only had a gendered view of autism,
um,

373
00:24:09.580 --> 00:24:13.510
he had an extremely eugenicist view in general.
Again,

374
00:24:13.540 --> 00:24:15.040
some people point to his,

375
00:24:15.041 --> 00:24:19.930
a few sets of language about the highly original genius of children on the most

376
00:24:19.931 --> 00:24:24.820
favorable and of the autistic range.
And they speculate that he used his,

377
00:24:24.940 --> 00:24:29.920
um,
the autism diagnosis is a way of protecting children from the killing saying

378
00:24:29.921 --> 00:24:33.850
they're so great that he was using the autism diagnosis,

379
00:24:33.851 --> 00:24:37.540
like a psychiatric Schindler's list.
Right.
Um,

380
00:24:38.050 --> 00:24:42.640
but this benevolent rhetoric was in keeping with Nazi psychiatry.

381
00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:46.510
All these guys were writing really great things about children that this was

382
00:24:46.511 --> 00:24:50.510
their rhetoric.
The children that they believed could be brought into the folk.

383
00:24:50.650 --> 00:24:54.250
It was the children that they believed were irredeemable,
um,

384
00:24:54.340 --> 00:24:55.900
that they exterminated.

385
00:24:55.930 --> 00:24:59.950
There was a real bifurcated idea of disability in Nazi Germany.

386
00:24:59.951 --> 00:25:01.870
It wasn't just that you were disabled,

387
00:25:01.871 --> 00:25:05.850
you could be remediated or you were worthless.
It was,
uh,

388
00:25:06.100 --> 00:25:09.070
there was a solid line there.
Um,
so those,

389
00:25:09.071 --> 00:25:13.720
this has Asberger's language who were on the unfavorable end of his rage would

390
00:25:13.721 --> 00:25:18.310
grow up to roam the streets as originals,
grotesque and dilapidated.

391
00:25:21.870 --> 00:25:24.600
Okay.
So how did we get to where we are today?

392
00:25:24.601 --> 00:25:27.870
Just briefly and then this'll be part of the extended conversation.

393
00:25:28.770 --> 00:25:32.970
What I think is most telling is Asperger never really wrote about autism again

394
00:25:33.480 --> 00:25:37.590
after the war.
He didn't disavow it.

395
00:25:37.591 --> 00:25:40.380
He just never conducted any more research on it.

396
00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:44.520
And he wrote a handful of very short papers for newsletters,

397
00:25:44.970 --> 00:25:46.800
but that's really about it.

398
00:25:46.830 --> 00:25:51.830
He was more interested in religious themes and social commentary and um,

399
00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:55.650
you know,
so to my mind,

400
00:25:55.651 --> 00:25:59.070
this really makes me question the extent to which he believed in the autism

401
00:25:59.071 --> 00:26:00.870
diagnosis to begin with.

402
00:26:00.871 --> 00:26:05.250
Or was this a strategic careerist moved during the Nazi period where he followed

403
00:26:05.251 --> 00:26:08.550
his senior colleagues for a short period of time.

404
00:26:08.551 --> 00:26:13.170
God has promotion and then revealed his true interests after the war.

405
00:26:14.510 --> 00:26:15.180
Um,

406
00:26:15.180 --> 00:26:19.800
so he probably would have been a footnote in the history of autism had it not

407
00:26:19.801 --> 00:26:21.720
been for Lorna wing.
Um,

408
00:26:21.750 --> 00:26:26.750
she was a leading British psychiatrist who'd IX conducted extensive research on

409
00:26:26.911 --> 00:26:27.660
youths.

410
00:26:27.660 --> 00:26:31.530
Her daughter Susie was on the spectrum and she was interested in children who

411
00:26:31.531 --> 00:26:35.130
she didn't think fit into canners diagnosis.
Um,

412
00:26:35.550 --> 00:26:39.300
but she did far more research than Asperger ever did.
Um,

413
00:26:39.450 --> 00:26:44.450
but she came across Asberger's thesis that her husband translated her and named

414
00:26:44.820 --> 00:26:45.690
her work,

415
00:26:45.691 --> 00:26:50.691
what she was seeing Asperger syndrome as a professional courtesy.

416
00:26:51.550 --> 00:26:55.890
Um,
she made a couple of fateful decisions with that

417
00:26:57.900 --> 00:27:02.310
article is that she decided not to call Asperger's syndrome a psychopathy.

418
00:27:02.670 --> 00:27:04.500
She wanted to use a neutral term.

419
00:27:04.980 --> 00:27:07.950
So when the idea of aspergers hit the English speaking world,

420
00:27:07.951 --> 00:27:11.130
it was Asperger's syndrome,
not Asperger's,
psychopathy.

421
00:27:11.580 --> 00:27:16.580
And then she also purged her article of the pejorative language that he'd used.

422
00:27:17.340 --> 00:27:21.810
So He'd been calling these kids sadistic and malicious and she purged all of

423
00:27:21.811 --> 00:27:23.400
that language.
Um,

424
00:27:23.430 --> 00:27:27.210
and so what we know today is Asperger's syndrome is really wings syndrome.

425
00:27:28.140 --> 00:27:31.080
Um,
I would,
I would argue,
um,

426
00:27:34.350 --> 00:27:39.090
and then once her work became published,
um,
in 1981,

427
00:27:39.091 --> 00:27:40.980
it's slowly grain to gain traction.

428
00:27:40.981 --> 00:27:44.430
And then in the 1990s is when it really exploded.

429
00:27:44.431 --> 00:27:47.850
And entered our diagnostic lexicon today.

430
00:27:48.630 --> 00:27:51.960
I personally believe we should stop using the term Asperger's.

431
00:27:51.961 --> 00:27:56.961
And I've written for scientific American and the New York Times and Time

432
00:27:57.181 --> 00:28:01.440
magazine saying that we should no longer use this and m um,

433
00:28:01.710 --> 00:28:03.870
and such.
The book's been published.

434
00:28:04.170 --> 00:28:08.160
This is just a few reviews that have also gone as far as to say we should

435
00:28:08.161 --> 00:28:11.920
discontinue the use of the term Asperger's and um,

436
00:28:11.940 --> 00:28:14.520
we can talk about that as well.

437
00:28:14.730 --> 00:28:18.840
I just want to point out the broader aim of my book is not to cause you know,

438
00:28:18.841 --> 00:28:22.020
a kerfluffle today,
but to really show is,

439
00:28:22.110 --> 00:28:26.880
is a warning to all of us how psychiatric diagnoses can be shaped by social and

440
00:28:26.881 --> 00:28:30.120
political forces we may not be aware of.
Um,

441
00:28:30.150 --> 00:28:34.740
and that they're shaped by forces beyond individual patients and doctors.

442
00:28:34.741 --> 00:28:39.150
And we really need to question what may be underlying them as they change over

443
00:28:39.151 --> 00:28:40.740
time.
So thank you.

444
00:28:44.910 --> 00:28:48.840
It's really quite a work of scholarship.

445
00:28:49.110 --> 00:28:52.140
I've dug into it over the weekend,
didn't get through the whole thing.

446
00:28:52.590 --> 00:28:56.530
So you spent quite a bit of time researching it.
Tell us why you pee.

447
00:28:57.300 --> 00:28:59.460
How did you come to this topic?

448
00:28:59.461 --> 00:29:04.140
Because you've written another book about how the Germans built the Iron
Curtain.

449
00:29:04.141 --> 00:29:08.460
So you clearly had an interest in Germany and the Nazi era,
but why this book?

450
00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:11.820
Sure.
I jumped from the Cold War to the Third Reich.
Um,

451
00:29:13.140 --> 00:29:17.610
so my son Eric was diagnosed with autism when he was 17 months old.

452
00:29:17.640 --> 00:29:19.500
And um,
you know,

453
00:29:19.501 --> 00:29:24.501
like any parent read everything I could about the diagnosis and in basically

454
00:29:25.021 --> 00:29:28.650
every parent manual,
it would go on about Leo Kanner,

455
00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:33.030
the American who came up with his diagnosis and the American who actually moved

456
00:29:33.031 --> 00:29:37.750
from Austria Derrida.
Dot.
Yeah,
thanks to your research.
I now know that.
Okay.

457
00:29:37.890 --> 00:29:42.190
Um,
and uh,
there'd always be a paragraph or two saying

458
00:29:42.340 --> 00:29:46.000
<v 3>there's this Hans Asperger who was working in Nazi dn and he was a really good</v>

459
00:29:46.001 --> 00:29:48.850
guy.
Um,
but not much is known about him.

460
00:29:49.480 --> 00:29:54.480
And I had a conference on my first book in Vienna and I decided to look into the

461
00:29:56.081 --> 00:29:59.830
story because I had heard this idea of autism was the psychiatric Schindler's

462
00:29:59.831 --> 00:30:03.940
list.
It was on his Wikipedia page.
It was in all these parent manuals.

463
00:30:04.390 --> 00:30:07.210
And,
um,
my very first day in the archives,

464
00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:12.400
the very first file I looked at was his Nazi district party file.

465
00:30:12.401 --> 00:30:17.110
And it had this extraordinary record of his reliability when it came to racial

466
00:30:17.111 --> 00:30:20.380
hygiene policy and his involvement.
It's remarkable.

467
00:30:20.381 --> 00:30:25.381
So among many of us know the statistics more than 6 million Jews murdered in the

468
00:30:27.011 --> 00:30:27.821
Nazi regime.

469
00:30:27.821 --> 00:30:32.821
But you quoted a figure that I was surprised with so low 200,000 people with

470
00:30:33.350 --> 00:30:37.570
disability and I would have expected a far greater number.

471
00:30:37.930 --> 00:30:38.763
Um,

472
00:30:39.190 --> 00:30:44.190
but there was a notion that there were individuals in society who were not going

473
00:30:45.221 --> 00:30:46.210
to contribute,

474
00:30:46.211 --> 00:30:51.211
either were physically fit to or somehow had a physical disability,

475
00:30:51.640 --> 00:30:56.470
intellectual disability,
missing mythic title.
That is a weird,
you know,

476
00:30:56.471 --> 00:31:01.471
that the sense of like a German spirit or the soul of the society.

477
00:31:03.580 --> 00:31:06.700
That's a very interesting and nuanced issue.

478
00:31:07.090 --> 00:31:12.090
So some children were saved by doctor s Burger and his team at the school was

479
00:31:13.360 --> 00:31:16.450
called again the,
Oh,
the cured of education,

480
00:31:16.500 --> 00:31:21.070
Curative Education Clinic and a number.
We're,

481
00:31:21.220 --> 00:31:24.910
uh,
we can't prove that,
but,
oh yeah.
I mean,

482
00:31:24.911 --> 00:31:26.710
I don't rule it out.
I,

483
00:31:27.520 --> 00:31:31.630
I don't think he went out of his way to save children necessarily,

484
00:31:31.631 --> 00:31:33.850
but I wouldn't rule it out.

485
00:31:33.851 --> 00:31:38.851
But we can conclusively say that dozens of children he transferred to the

486
00:31:39.041 --> 00:31:42.700
killing center died.
I want to pick up on a little bit of what you said.

487
00:31:42.700 --> 00:31:47.080
So the official statistics are about 200,000 people with disabilities.

488
00:31:48.040 --> 00:31:51.370
I think that's a vast understatement.
And a lot of historians do too,

489
00:31:51.371 --> 00:31:55.570
because they were simply starve.
Oh.
At these places like,

490
00:31:55.620 --> 00:32:00.490
so these hospitals and these asylums wouldn't be adequately,
um,
you know,

491
00:32:00.760 --> 00:32:02.580
rationed.
And,
um,

492
00:32:02.620 --> 00:32:07.620
we also know people would deliver the elderly in their households to old age

493
00:32:08.201 --> 00:32:09.820
homes.
Um,
you know,

494
00:32:09.821 --> 00:32:13.420
where life expectancy would probably be lower than if they'd received great

495
00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:16.630
achievements.
So it's hard to know it.
Yeah.

496
00:32:16.900 --> 00:32:21.790
And how do you research and what did you find in your research of this folk,

497
00:32:21.850 --> 00:32:25.460
this German folk who would,
um,

498
00:32:25.810 --> 00:32:30.810
turn over the infirm to an institutional solution and in,

499
00:32:33.681 --> 00:32:37.690
in fact,
even willingly.
And you and I,

500
00:32:37.780 --> 00:32:42.780
I also have a child with a form of autism and I'm well aware of the challenges

501
00:32:43.131 --> 00:32:45.860
but also some of the joys and raising these children.

502
00:32:46.400 --> 00:32:50.060
But I have seen parents who walk away as well.

503
00:32:50.350 --> 00:32:51.830
We do walk away from their kids.

504
00:32:53.100 --> 00:32:57.780
<v 0>Yeah.
And um,
yeah,
it's remarkable.</v>

505
00:32:57.781 --> 00:33:01.860
I mean I do want to say,
um,
you know,

506
00:33:01.861 --> 00:33:04.650
there was a wide range of parental responses.

507
00:33:04.860 --> 00:33:09.120
So I went through some of the letters that parents had sent to the director of

508
00:33:09.121 --> 00:33:13.020
Spiegel grand after the deaths of their children and some are really heart

509
00:33:13.021 --> 00:33:17.520
wrenching and tear stained and you know,
how could this possibly have happened.

510
00:33:18.020 --> 00:33:22.710
Um,
and then there are some thank you notes.
Um,

511
00:33:23.040 --> 00:33:24.330
so I think

512
00:33:25.340 --> 00:33:26.210
<v 3>you know,
what,</v>

513
00:33:26.270 --> 00:33:30.730
what comes permissible cam lit up our darkest impulses so far.

514
00:33:30.731 --> 00:33:35.731
Do you think in our own evolution awareness of the incidents of autism in

515
00:33:37.310 --> 00:33:38.001
society?

516
00:33:38.001 --> 00:33:43.001
Certainly California has been one of the states that has tracked the increased

517
00:33:43.100 --> 00:33:47.240
incidents probably most closely of any US state.

518
00:33:48.050 --> 00:33:53.050
Why was Dr Asper a till now given such a benign moniker?

519
00:33:54.740 --> 00:33:57.050
I always understood he was one,

520
00:33:57.330 --> 00:34:02.330
a doctor who actually classified in typified the range of,

521
00:34:02.550 --> 00:34:05.150
uh,
autism across this spectrum.

522
00:34:06.360 --> 00:34:10.200
<v 0>Sure.
So if you read his 1944 thesis,
um,</v>

523
00:34:10.710 --> 00:34:14.880
it reads extremely generously,
you know,
he focused on,

524
00:34:14.970 --> 00:34:19.200
he focuses on children who are in the higher end of his range.
Right.

525
00:34:19.201 --> 00:34:23.820
And he thought those boys were great and could be better than normal people.

526
00:34:24.090 --> 00:34:28.810
Right.
And so the eugenicist aspect of his work obscured how you genesis,

527
00:34:28.820 --> 00:34:30.570
he was being,
you know,

528
00:34:30.571 --> 00:34:33.480
he wasn't writing about the kids who he was deeming worthless.

529
00:34:33.810 --> 00:34:38.810
So there was a silence and that historical record and that hasn't come out until

530
00:34:39.121 --> 00:34:43.980
now.
Um,
and so if you take his word for it,

531
00:34:43.981 --> 00:34:48.090
he's very benevolent.
Yeah.
Right.
He was fighting the pearls.

532
00:34:48.280 --> 00:34:50.770
<v 3>Yeah.
Among,
among the population.</v>

533
00:34:51.220 --> 00:34:55.930
So you said earlier that Lauren and wings definition of Asperger's syndrome

534
00:34:55.960 --> 00:34:58.790
differed from his own,
and how so?

535
00:34:58.791 --> 00:35:01.360
And tell me a little bit more about her work,

536
00:35:01.361 --> 00:35:04.570
because this is the first I've ever heard of Laura.
Laura,
no,
wait.
Yeah,

537
00:35:04.700 --> 00:35:05.960
<v 0>sure.
Um,</v>

538
00:35:06.470 --> 00:35:11.180
so she was the person who coined the term autism spectrum.

539
00:35:12.350 --> 00:35:15.200
Asperger disagreed with her.
They met for tea,

540
00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:18.940
it Maudsley hospital in London.
And um,

541
00:35:19.010 --> 00:35:21.740
she believed that what Leo Kanner was describing,

542
00:35:21.741 --> 00:35:25.400
which what you know today is called classic autism.
Um,

543
00:35:25.430 --> 00:35:29.440
and what Asperger was describing were part of the same continuum.
Right.
Um,

544
00:35:29.720 --> 00:35:33.410
and this is the autism spectrum as we understand it today.
Um,

545
00:35:33.710 --> 00:35:38.220
Asperger really disagreed and what he published later in life,
you know,

546
00:35:38.221 --> 00:35:41.270
I said he didn't publish much,
but what he did,
uh,

547
00:35:41.340 --> 00:35:44.580
published was dedicated to showing that his form of autism was better.

548
00:35:45.030 --> 00:35:48.810
And so he was calling canners,
uh,
kids,
uh,

549
00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:53.130
psychotic and hopeless and irremediable,

550
00:35:53.131 --> 00:35:54.120
whereas his kids,

551
00:35:54.390 --> 00:35:59.340
he was even more hyperbolic about kids with Asperger's syndrome than he was

552
00:35:59.341 --> 00:36:00.960
during the war.
So again,

553
00:36:00.961 --> 00:36:04.740
the argument that he was stressing the special ability of kids to save them,

554
00:36:04.830 --> 00:36:08.220
I don't think holds true cause he was even more glowing about these kids in the

555
00:36:08.221 --> 00:36:12.470
postwar period when he was trying to separate himself from Canor.

556
00:36:12.990 --> 00:36:17.460
Um,
so Lorna wing really saw this as part of it,

557
00:36:17.461 --> 00:36:20.310
one continuum and Asperger disagreed with her on that.

558
00:36:20.340 --> 00:36:23.850
But that's the part of the spectrum that then we've picked up from Lorna wing.

559
00:36:24.600 --> 00:36:29.600
But at the end of her life in 2014 she said she ultimately regretted bringing

560
00:36:30.691 --> 00:36:35.691
aspergers name into this because she thought that it become too much of a

561
00:36:36.391 --> 00:36:39.480
concrete label.
Oh,
it is distinct from autism.

562
00:36:39.930 --> 00:36:42.960
And that that did a disservice to her idea of a spectrum.

563
00:36:43.460 --> 00:36:47.750
<v 3>That's fascinating because in um,
in autism circles,</v>

564
00:36:48.050 --> 00:36:51.740
you often want to say,
oh yeah,
asked for.
It's the good kind of autism.
Yeah.

565
00:36:51.770 --> 00:36:56.300
So it has even persisted.
You'll kid it'll be okay.
Yeah.
Subconsciously.

566
00:36:56.301 --> 00:36:57.230
It's very interesting.

567
00:36:57.590 --> 00:37:01.520
So what are the lessons you think we can draw from your book about how we treat

568
00:37:01.521 --> 00:37:06.521
people in today's atmosphere of hype and awareness and the desire to act and

569
00:37:07.341 --> 00:37:10.100
speak more inclusively?
We have a very active

570
00:37:11.990 --> 00:37:16.670
group at Google,
um,
called the disability network.

571
00:37:16.790 --> 00:37:21.020
Many of us,
our parents,
there's an autism group at Google.

572
00:37:21.021 --> 00:37:26.021
And so we do work very hard here to be supportive and to create environments

573
00:37:27.591 --> 00:37:31.510
where people on the spectrum can thrive because there's a,

574
00:37:31.520 --> 00:37:36.520
an enormous range of intellectual potential that can be tapped productively for

575
00:37:37.970 --> 00:37:39.500
a lot of the work we do here.

576
00:37:39.860 --> 00:37:44.860
So what lessons do you have or modern companies,

577
00:37:45.441 --> 00:37:48.890
modern societies,
schools around inclusivity?

578
00:37:50.070 --> 00:37:54.810
<v 0>Um,
I just think it's so important to look at people as individuals.
I mean,</v>

579
00:37:54.811 --> 00:37:58.140
labels can obscure far more than they can reveal.

580
00:37:58.141 --> 00:38:00.870
And I can just say from my experience with my son,

581
00:38:01.260 --> 00:38:05.610
people make assumptions about what he is like all the time to his core,

582
00:38:05.970 --> 00:38:09.450
you know,
um,
he's one of the most empathetic social kids I know.

583
00:38:09.780 --> 00:38:13.140
And if I happen to say he's on the spectrum or has Asperger's,

584
00:38:13.141 --> 00:38:15.600
then they make assumptions that he lacks commute.

585
00:38:16.200 --> 00:38:20.550
I would say that he's got my commute than anybody.
Yeah.
And I mean,

586
00:38:20.551 --> 00:38:25.260
I think a lot of our stereotypes about autism today involves commute,
frankly.

587
00:38:25.310 --> 00:38:27.840
Um,
we were told he lacked emotionality.

588
00:38:27.841 --> 00:38:31.950
He lack capacity for relationships when he was diagnosed.
It was terrifying.

589
00:38:31.951 --> 00:38:36.130
The kinds of things they were telling us about her son.
Um,

590
00:38:36.310 --> 00:38:40.300
and over the years he's become him.
And as a mother,

591
00:38:40.301 --> 00:38:44.090
it took me a couple of years to see beyond the label.
I,
you know,

592
00:38:44.170 --> 00:38:47.410
I was treating him like a therapist.
These doctors knew better than I did,

593
00:38:47.950 --> 00:38:52.180
and they were telling me things about my son,
you know,

594
00:38:52.510 --> 00:38:53.680
that I was believing.

595
00:38:53.681 --> 00:38:56.830
And it wasn't until after a few years of being at it that I got some more

596
00:38:56.831 --> 00:38:59.420
confidence and was like,
no,
I'm the expert in Eric.

597
00:38:59.890 --> 00:39:04.600
I might not be the expert on autism,
but I'm the expert on my son.
And so,
um,

598
00:39:04.630 --> 00:39:04.931
you know,

599
00:39:04.931 --> 00:39:09.520
I think the lesson is you just really need to see people as individuals.

600
00:39:10.170 --> 00:39:15.170
<v 3>So are you on a bit of a campaign to stamp out the use of Asperger's as a kind</v>

601
00:39:17.491 --> 00:39:19.630
of a definitional,
um,

602
00:39:20.070 --> 00:39:22.830
diagnostic in this autism spectrum?

603
00:39:23.360 --> 00:39:28.140
<v 0>Um,
okay.
I have a couple answers to that.
First is,
uh,</v>

604
00:39:28.220 --> 00:39:29.600
when it comes to medical ethics,

605
00:39:29.601 --> 00:39:32.720
I think the answer is clear that we should drop it.

606
00:39:32.721 --> 00:39:37.160
There've been a number of Nazi era diagnoses that have been renamed.

607
00:39:37.280 --> 00:39:41.630
So reactive arthritis used to be Reiter's syndrome.
And so,
um,

608
00:39:41.720 --> 00:39:46.720
in medical eponyms are granted to either commend someone for discovering a

609
00:39:47.571 --> 00:39:51.770
condition or to honor their life's work.
And so,
you know,

610
00:39:51.771 --> 00:39:52.610
as I've outlined,

611
00:39:52.611 --> 00:39:56.090
what Asperger defined as Asperger's syndrome has no bearing on how we,

612
00:39:56.160 --> 00:39:59.540
we don't see kids today.
Psychopaths.
Right,
right.
Um,

613
00:39:59.660 --> 00:40:03.320
and he doesn't deserve the honor.
So I think that answer is simple.

614
00:40:03.980 --> 00:40:08.300
The problem is millions of people have this identity now.
Right.
Um,

615
00:40:08.420 --> 00:40:13.280
and I think that's ultimately an open question.
But I do think in our culture,

616
00:40:13.281 --> 00:40:18.080
Asperger's syndrome has taken on a bit of a eugenicist connotation.

617
00:40:18.440 --> 00:40:20.490
<v 3>And what do you,
can you explain to us?</v>

618
00:40:20.850 --> 00:40:22.500
For those of you who haven't read the book,

619
00:40:22.810 --> 00:40:27.210
what do you mean by a eugenicist connotation?
Because that's a very loaded,

620
00:40:27.450 --> 00:40:31.170
<v 0>it are men.
It's very,
it's very clear.
Yeah.</v>

621
00:40:31.171 --> 00:40:36.120
I'm speaking from my own experience.
So my son has received three diagnoses,

622
00:40:36.121 --> 00:40:41.010
autism,
Asperger's,
and PDD nos.
Oh,
I don't know.

623
00:40:41.011 --> 00:40:45.180
Do you remember Pdd Nos?
Not otherwise specified,
otherwise specified.

624
00:40:45.490 --> 00:40:49.170
Just see something.
Right.
And,
um,
you know,

625
00:40:49.171 --> 00:40:51.030
when I would tell people he has autism,

626
00:40:51.031 --> 00:40:54.720
they'd have a certain reaction when I'd say aspergers,
they'd be like,
oh wow.

627
00:40:55.380 --> 00:40:58.590
You know,
there was sort of,
and it's the same kid,

628
00:40:58.591 --> 00:41:02.580
but just different assumptions being made.
And um,
I do think that,

629
00:41:03.540 --> 00:41:05.440
yeah,
there's,
yeah.

630
00:41:06.480 --> 00:41:09.000
<v 3>So time to stomp it out perhaps.</v>

631
00:41:09.001 --> 00:41:14.001
So do you want to talk to us a little bit about your thoughts and your research?

632
00:41:14.710 --> 00:41:19.110
Uh,
on the term neurodiversity because the world is neuro diverse.

633
00:41:19.111 --> 00:41:22.140
We are all neuro diverse.
Um,
but it's,

634
00:41:22.410 --> 00:41:26.220
it's application is a little narrower in its common use.

635
00:41:26.221 --> 00:41:28.110
Do you want to talk to us a bit about that?

636
00:41:28.690 --> 00:41:30.940
<v 0>Um,
I mean,</v>

637
00:41:30.941 --> 00:41:35.941
I can speak to autism is particularly

638
00:41:36.550 --> 00:41:37.383
<v 2>mmm.</v>

639
00:41:37.530 --> 00:41:38.250
<v 0>Difficult.</v>

640
00:41:38.250 --> 00:41:43.250
It's unique in psychiatric diagnoses because they haven't identified a common

641
00:41:43.800 --> 00:41:44.940
physiological,

642
00:41:45.860 --> 00:41:46.693
<v 2>MMM,</v>

643
00:41:47.220 --> 00:41:48.630
<v 0>underlying condition,
right?</v>

644
00:41:48.631 --> 00:41:52.510
So if someone's bipolar or schizophrenia or schizophrenia,
um,

645
00:41:52.530 --> 00:41:56.850
supposedly there's medication for that,
right?
Where's autism?

646
00:41:56.851 --> 00:42:00.660
There's no one pill that you can take that addresses whatever it is you want to

647
00:42:00.661 --> 00:42:04.560
address.
And so it's a heterogeneous diagnosis and we know that.

648
00:42:04.561 --> 00:42:08.670
And they're likely to,
as you said,
with your son,
a different underlying causes,

649
00:42:08.671 --> 00:42:11.820
genetic,
environmental for different kids that,
um,

650
00:42:12.510 --> 00:42:17.510
and so in the book I liken it to where we were with hysteria a hundred years

651
00:42:19.260 --> 00:42:23.760
ago.
Um,
which was a catch all term for women who couldn't control their emotions.

652
00:42:24.050 --> 00:42:28.260
Um,
so if you think about it,
autism's a diagnosis for under emotional boys.

653
00:42:28.650 --> 00:42:32.100
Interesting history as a diagnosis of sensibly male,

654
00:42:32.520 --> 00:42:37.520
finally overly emotional women and hysteria at the time included epilepsy,

655
00:42:37.681 --> 00:42:40.860
syphilis,
anxiety,
depression,
you know,

656
00:42:40.861 --> 00:42:42.690
any kind of psychiatric disorder.

657
00:42:42.691 --> 00:42:47.580
And it wasn't until medicine advanced that you were able to break it out into,

658
00:42:47.670 --> 00:42:49.590
um,
and I think,
you know,

659
00:42:49.591 --> 00:42:54.591
science recognizes the autism is an umbrella label and they're starting to break

660
00:42:54.841 --> 00:42:58.200
out different subtypes.
Um,
I don't know where it will go,

661
00:42:58.201 --> 00:43:02.670
but right now we just don't have a vocabulary that's adequate.
Um,

662
00:43:03.180 --> 00:43:06.570
so when we say neuro diversity,
I mean,
I think especially with autism,

663
00:43:06.571 --> 00:43:10.950
it's important not to make assumptions because it's not a coherent term.

664
00:43:11.160 --> 00:43:14.820
Agreed.
Now I can keep asking questions.
I have many to ask,

665
00:43:14.821 --> 00:43:18.930
but there are probably some questions in either the audience or on a dory.

666
00:43:18.960 --> 00:43:19.800
Is that correct?

667
00:43:20.390 --> 00:43:21.890
<v 4>So it sounds like your,
um,</v>

668
00:43:21.920 --> 00:43:25.880
your path to this book was a little bit surprising to you at the start of it,

669
00:43:25.910 --> 00:43:30.440
how you just went to Vienna for a conference and you happen to find this first

670
00:43:30.441 --> 00:43:35.330
bit of research that you did.
Um,
from like the Nazi perspective,

671
00:43:36.200 --> 00:43:41.090
how is the reception to your research as you started to uncover more and more

672
00:43:41.180 --> 00:43:46.170
of,
um,
something that obviously was in contrast to the Po,

673
00:43:46.250 --> 00:43:48.680
the common perception of Asperger?
Okay.

674
00:43:48.840 --> 00:43:50.730
<v 0>Yeah,
that's a great question.
Um,</v>

675
00:43:52.620 --> 00:43:56.850
so I will say when I came back from Vienna and talked to my agent who'd been

676
00:43:56.851 --> 00:44:01.470
very excited about this Schindler's story,
it's like,
forget it.

677
00:44:02.270 --> 00:44:05.620
Don't pay me back.
Bring me that.
Um,

678
00:44:06.240 --> 00:44:09.950
so that was kind of remarkable to me.
And,
um,

679
00:44:10.980 --> 00:44:13.740
as I was writing the book,
I was surprised,

680
00:44:13.741 --> 00:44:18.510
I would speak with colleagues that would almost minimize,

681
00:44:18.900 --> 00:44:23.820
I think,
um,
what he was doing.
So Asperger was transferring people to speak.
Oh,

682
00:44:23.821 --> 00:44:27.900
grunty wasn't directly involved with murder.
Um,

683
00:44:27.960 --> 00:44:30.870
to me it's completely a few transfer someone to Auschwitz,
you know,

684
00:44:30.871 --> 00:44:34.830
what doing right.
Um,
and so as I was writing the book,
it was interesting,

685
00:44:34.831 --> 00:44:37.140
I had a lot of conversations with people like,
well,

686
00:44:37.141 --> 00:44:41.700
it's only a handful of kids and he did it in directly and what's the big deal?

687
00:44:42.090 --> 00:44:44.970
Um,
so I was expecting a lot of push back when the book came out,

688
00:44:44.971 --> 00:44:49.830
but I think to present the book with all its evidence was so undeniable that

689
00:44:49.831 --> 00:44:54.831
I've been really pleased by how seriously people have taken it,

690
00:44:55.200 --> 00:44:56.520
the body of evidence,

691
00:44:56.760 --> 00:45:00.180
and that even though he wasn't directly holding the kids hands,

692
00:45:00.181 --> 00:45:04.170
that people recognize how you know,
what he was doing.
Um,

693
00:45:04.171 --> 00:45:09.120
so I've been really surprised and really gratified.
Um,
but yeah,

694
00:45:10.320 --> 00:45:12.270
<v 4>I guess follow up question to that.
Um,</v>

695
00:45:13.380 --> 00:45:18.090
it sounds like Asperger was never held accountable to what he did join the war.

696
00:45:18.740 --> 00:45:22.360
Um,
how does that,
how did that happen?
Radios.

697
00:45:22.920 --> 00:45:27.750
<v 0>Sure.
So,
um,
the biggest factors,
I said he never joined the Nazi party,</v>

698
00:45:28.320 --> 00:45:32.940
so he was never purged from the children's hospital the way his other colleagues

699
00:45:32.941 --> 00:45:37.380
were.
Um,
second is he himself claimed he was a resister.

700
00:45:37.381 --> 00:45:41.040
He claimed that he rescued children.
These were all his own claims.

701
00:45:41.160 --> 00:45:45.570
Schindler he was the good guy.
He was the good guy.
And um,

702
00:45:46.320 --> 00:45:49.740
he was not widely known in Austria.

703
00:45:49.770 --> 00:45:52.650
He was not a major perpetrator,
you know,

704
00:45:52.651 --> 00:45:57.360
Austrian and German historians have bigger figures of interest.
So,

705
00:45:57.361 --> 00:46:01.770
um,
his role was,
was not of interest to holocaust historians.

706
00:46:02.280 --> 00:46:02.940
Um,

707
00:46:02.940 --> 00:46:07.940
autism is not a big diagnosis and German speaking countries,

708
00:46:08.311 --> 00:46:12.420
it's more of an,
um,
you know,
English speaking diagnosis or in other countries.

709
00:46:12.480 --> 00:46:17.040
And so autism wasn't of great interest to German historians.
So you combine that,

710
00:46:17.041 --> 00:46:20.460
he's not a big holocaust figure.
Autism sound interesting and this,

711
00:46:20.490 --> 00:46:25.470
this just doesn't come out and people took his word for it.
I will say.

712
00:46:25.530 --> 00:46:27.840
Um,
so in 1994,

713
00:46:27.841 --> 00:46:32.340
that's the year Asperger disorder entered our diagnostic manual.

714
00:46:32.800 --> 00:46:33.633
Um,

715
00:46:34.410 --> 00:46:38.880
the American psychiatric association is supposed to vet names.

716
00:46:39.060 --> 00:46:41.010
If you give an upon a misdiagnosis,

717
00:46:41.011 --> 00:46:43.560
you're supposed to look into the person's background.

718
00:46:43.830 --> 00:46:48.830
He wasn't even on the list of names to be vetted for the American Psychiatric

719
00:46:49.050 --> 00:46:49.560
Association.

720
00:46:49.560 --> 00:46:54.560
There was one doctor on the team that corresponded with archivists in Vienna

721
00:46:56.070 --> 00:46:59.580
and,
um,
archivists would write back,
we don't,
we don't know much,

722
00:46:59.610 --> 00:47:03.030
but one of the archivists wrote back like,
Whoa,
wait,

723
00:47:03.060 --> 00:47:07.350
do some research because anyone in this position would have probably been

724
00:47:07.351 --> 00:47:08.640
involved in some capacity,

725
00:47:08.641 --> 00:47:12.750
but for various reasons there was momentum to get this into the DSM.

726
00:47:13.540 --> 00:47:17.860
<v 5>That's fascinating.
You know,
I don't know how many of you know Simon Baron Cohen,</v>

727
00:47:17.861 --> 00:47:22.180
but he is the father of Sasha Baron Cohen and he's also the director of the

728
00:47:22.181 --> 00:47:26.800
autism research center at Cambridge in,
in the United Kingdom.
And what he,

729
00:47:26.860 --> 00:47:31.860
he was very complimentary towards research and it said how Edith uncover is how

730
00:47:31.961 --> 00:47:33.310
under Hitler's regime,

731
00:47:33.700 --> 00:47:37.900
the profession of psychiatry became the eyes and ears of the Third Reich.

732
00:47:38.320 --> 00:47:41.460
And that's kind of frightening when you think of,
uh,

733
00:47:41.970 --> 00:47:46.970
the role of medicine and doctors in calling the population and making

734
00:47:47.651 --> 00:47:52.390
determinations about who survived and who didn't.

735
00:47:53.080 --> 00:47:55.210
<v 0>If I could piggyback on that,
um,</v>

736
00:47:56.260 --> 00:48:01.260
the Nazis compiled her a Terry indexes whereby everyone had an index card or

737
00:48:05.111 --> 00:48:08.320
this was the goal.
They got to about 12% of the population,

738
00:48:08.680 --> 00:48:12.860
about 25% of the population in Vienna where they would call,
um,

739
00:48:12.940 --> 00:48:17.440
medical records,
asylum records,
school records,

740
00:48:17.920 --> 00:48:19.300
welfare records,

741
00:48:19.360 --> 00:48:23.590
and to create a composite diagnosis of a person as a social,

742
00:48:23.860 --> 00:48:26.650
as you know,
a vagrant is wayward.

743
00:48:26.651 --> 00:48:31.000
There were all these kind of blurred sociomedical terms that were used at the

744
00:48:31.001 --> 00:48:35.890
time.
So it's really medicalizing,
one's economic,
social status.

745
00:48:35.891 --> 00:48:37.630
And so,
um,
yeah,

746
00:48:37.631 --> 00:48:41.950
these index cards then became the basis of who would be forcibly sterilized.

747
00:48:42.310 --> 00:48:46.580
Almost half a million Germans were forcibly sterilized in this period.
Um,

748
00:48:46.660 --> 00:48:51.010
who would be granted permission to marry,
not everyone could marry.
Um,

749
00:48:51.430 --> 00:48:55.720
and then of course deportations or,
or worse.
But,
um,
yeah,

750
00:48:55.930 --> 00:48:59.110
the medical profession.
You know,
I,

751
00:48:59.111 --> 00:49:03.220
in the book I talk about the Third Reich,
I like to see it as a diagnosis regime.

752
00:49:03.730 --> 00:49:08.530
We focus so much on the outcomes of the concentration camps,

753
00:49:08.830 --> 00:49:13.830
but that's really the last event in a series of decisions and the initial

754
00:49:15.011 --> 00:49:19.510
decision whether or not to exterminate someone relies on diagnosis.
Right?

755
00:49:19.511 --> 00:49:23.350
Is this person remediable or is it not?
And that begins with your index cards.

756
00:49:23.351 --> 00:49:24.680
Right.
Um,

757
00:49:24.950 --> 00:49:25.581
<v 5>fascinating.</v>

758
00:49:25.581 --> 00:49:29.840
So you wonder if there's a modern day view of this whereby you have your DNA

759
00:49:29.841 --> 00:49:34.841
markers and you have the ability to select for certain characteristics if you

760
00:49:36.531 --> 00:49:38.350
are,
you know,

761
00:49:38.450 --> 00:49:43.450
doing a lab built baby and it's all very interesting to contemplate and deeper

762
00:49:43.491 --> 00:49:47.180
than we probably want to get into it.
Four in the afternoon,
uh,

763
00:49:47.181 --> 00:49:49.960
here in mountain view.
We have another question from Ms Straw.

764
00:49:51.110 --> 00:49:54.320
<v 4>I just have one question from the dory or have a couple that I don't want to</v>

765
00:49:54.321 --> 00:49:57.110
take up all the time very quickly from someone in Cambridge.

766
00:49:57.111 --> 00:50:02.111
She's watching at the moment and he says there has been much to be about how pro

767
00:50:02.691 --> 00:50:06.350
or Anti Nazi various folks from the third wreck were.

768
00:50:06.380 --> 00:50:11.380
Hans Asperger included here beyond correcting these historical facts,

769
00:50:12.230 --> 00:50:13.550
uh,
Michael Asks,

770
00:50:13.940 --> 00:50:18.940
what are the sort of further lessons that you would hope folks would draw from

771
00:50:19.461 --> 00:50:24.050
your book and apply to today?
Um,
he asks,

772
00:50:24.080 --> 00:50:28.220
what's a proper way to judge a person's role and responsibility within something

773
00:50:28.221 --> 00:50:31.370
like that and what lessons can we draw from that to the contemporary time?

774
00:50:34.960 --> 00:50:38.570
<v 0>Wow.
What a question that really gets to the heart of human nature.
Um,</v>

775
00:50:40.030 --> 00:50:41.980
yeah,
I mean,
I think,
um,

776
00:50:45.030 --> 00:50:47.220
there's a term that I like to use about the Third Reich,

777
00:50:47.221 --> 00:50:51.600
the muddled majority where is few suddenly transplanted,

778
00:50:51.630 --> 00:50:55.740
most Germans into Kansas,
they would behave completely differently.
Right.

779
00:50:55.890 --> 00:50:59.460
But if you're walking down the street and you see a store that says Jews

780
00:50:59.461 --> 00:51:00.211
unwanted,

781
00:51:00.211 --> 00:51:03.750
do you go in and do talk to the shopkeeper or do you just keep walking by?

782
00:51:03.751 --> 00:51:07.440
But then you might shop at a Jewish store to get better prices.

783
00:51:07.890 --> 00:51:12.780
And so most people were inhabiting this world of gray and um,

784
00:51:13.710 --> 00:51:18.080
you know,
I think
it would be nice and easy.

785
00:51:18.081 --> 00:51:20.870
And if you watch star wars,
they're good guys and they bad guys,

786
00:51:20.871 --> 00:51:25.000
but for most people living their lives,
it was really a muddled situation.
Yeah.

787
00:51:25.730 --> 00:51:30.650
How I come down,
I think the case of Asperger's clear,
luckily for me,

788
00:51:30.980 --> 00:51:35.900
um,
because if you're a conscious participant in the system of killing,

789
00:51:36.740 --> 00:51:39.410
that's that right?
Um,

790
00:51:39.440 --> 00:51:43.580
if you denounce someone who could be put to death,
that's that,
um,
I don't know,

791
00:51:43.581 --> 00:51:48.230
walking by a Jews unwanted sign,
what does that do?
What does that mean?

792
00:51:48.231 --> 00:51:52.400
That's something that's,
you know,
we live in a world of moral ambiguity now.

793
00:51:52.401 --> 00:51:56.990
I mean,
we're doing things in our everyday lives.

794
00:51:57.470 --> 00:52:00.860
I'm not going to,
yeah,
I don't want to get too political,

795
00:52:00.861 --> 00:52:04.400
but we're all living in a world of gray.
Um,

796
00:52:04.730 --> 00:52:09.500
but I do think it's important to illustrate that Asperger drifted into this,

797
00:52:10.970 --> 00:52:12.920
um,
for careerist reasons.

798
00:52:12.921 --> 00:52:16.430
He was trying to get ahead and I think it's just too important to be vigilant

799
00:52:16.431 --> 00:52:21.431
and to at least keep a bright line about when you put someone in harm's way.

800
00:52:22.161 --> 00:52:23.930
That's a very different thing.

801
00:52:25.560 --> 00:52:28.960
<v 4>All right,
one last one.
[inaudible] we're going to call it a wrap one last one.</v>

802
00:52:28.990 --> 00:52:33.160
Okay.
So from Sophie in Austin,
uh,
she says today,

803
00:52:33.161 --> 00:52:37.540
unfortunately there are many biases attached to autism and this knowledge of

804
00:52:37.541 --> 00:52:42.070
aspergers involvement in the Nazi era could potentially limit how someone

805
00:52:42.071 --> 00:52:44.970
considers high functioning,
um,

806
00:52:45.130 --> 00:52:47.300
and how they would understand the,

807
00:52:47.340 --> 00:52:51.340
the diagnosis and the full autism spectrum.
Um,

808
00:52:51.370 --> 00:52:56.370
do you have any suggestions going forward on how folks at can better communicate

809
00:52:57.370 --> 00:53:00.440
what Asperger's versus the autism spectrum?
Um,

810
00:53:00.670 --> 00:53:04.360
actually is do you have suggestions for particular language that's helpful for

811
00:53:04.361 --> 00:53:08.750
people to use in place of the language that we've been using for a while now?
Um,

812
00:53:11.580 --> 00:53:14.490
<v 0>sure.
I wish I had a magical answer.
As I said,</v>

813
00:53:14.491 --> 00:53:19.110
we're just left without a good vocabulary right now.
Um,
where psychiatry is,

814
00:53:19.410 --> 00:53:23.850
I personally tend to say my son is on the spectrum.
Yeah.

815
00:53:24.240 --> 00:53:28.920
And then I describe,
you know,
the same way I described my daughter,

816
00:53:29.200 --> 00:53:33.210
you know,
she has,
she's who she is.
He is who he is.
But um,

817
00:53:33.930 --> 00:53:37.560
I dunno.
Autism.
I don't,
I don't like the word.
I think the,

818
00:53:37.570 --> 00:53:41.970
I mean on the spectrum it's kind of benign and it invites conversation.

819
00:53:41.971 --> 00:53:45.500
I do what,
what are your thoughts?
I mean,
I use

820
00:53:45.540 --> 00:53:47.250
<v 5>so does a,
it's a handicap.</v>

821
00:53:47.280 --> 00:53:50.580
It's a handy way of describing a set of behaviors,

822
00:53:50.581 --> 00:53:53.550
but it doesn't begin to describe an individual.

823
00:53:54.180 --> 00:53:59.180
And I think that's an important reminder to us all that the world is made up of

824
00:53:59.851 --> 00:54:03.690
a beautiful mosaic of people.
And it is,
uh,

825
00:54:03.710 --> 00:54:07.860
everyone brings their own strengths and their own skills to the table.

826
00:54:08.130 --> 00:54:12.810
Some unfortunate people don't have sufficient skills to participate fully in

827
00:54:12.811 --> 00:54:17.130
society,
and we need to care for those people.
I live in San Francisco.

828
00:54:17.160 --> 00:54:19.740
A lot of them live on the streets right now.
They need care.

829
00:54:20.040 --> 00:54:25.040
It's shocking to me to see how we have such a wealthy area walked away from our

830
00:54:26.601 --> 00:54:30.180
responsibility to care for each other.
Uh,
but to be,

831
00:54:30.540 --> 00:54:35.540
to recognize the bounty and beauty of the human condition and value each

832
00:54:36.151 --> 00:54:40.760
individual,
uh,
is to me a very important reminder in,

833
00:54:40.761 --> 00:54:44.610
in your work and in our,
you know,
day to day lives.

834
00:54:44.910 --> 00:54:48.450
So with that,
this wraps another of our wonderful,

835
00:54:48.451 --> 00:54:52.800
toxic Google series.
Edith,
I want to thank you so much for coming in,

836
00:54:53.100 --> 00:54:58.080
for sharing your personal story and for writing this book and hopefully

837
00:54:58.380 --> 00:55:03.000
debunking the myth that probably very much deserves to be debunked.

838
00:55:03.030 --> 00:55:04.680
So thank you for all you've done.

839
00:55:05.460 --> 00:55:08.600
<v 1>[inaudible].</v>
