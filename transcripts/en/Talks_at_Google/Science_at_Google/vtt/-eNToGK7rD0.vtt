WEBVTT

1
00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.650
Um,
this is,

2
00:00:07.651 --> 00:00:11.250
this is basically going to be an entire master's course in about an hour.

3
00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.850
So you've saved a lot of money.
Um,
but,
uh,
yeah,

4
00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:16.590
I hope this is vaguely interesting.

5
00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:21.270
I hope that you're interested in kind of the story of us because this is what it

6
00:00:21.271 --> 00:00:25.400
is.
This is a story of humans in the last 15,000 years,

7
00:00:25.401 --> 00:00:30.030
in the last 15,000 years,
we've made some changes.
Um,
so yeah,

8
00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.760
this is the book.
It's about a third gossipy footnote.

9
00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.230
So just to give you an idea,
uh,
which is kind of what this talk will be also,

10
00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:43.680
everything is killing you.
Everything.
I think many of us has,
you know,

11
00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.130
sort of suspected this was true,
but not known it,
not been told it by scientists.

12
00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.660
So there you go.
Yes,
you're right.
Everything is killing you.

13
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.180
And the question is really,

14
00:00:54.181 --> 00:00:58.380
I think a lot of us look at sort of modern urban lives and sit there and go,
why,

15
00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.710
what,
what have we done?
Um,

16
00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:06.950
what happened once we were roaming the savannas with perfect abs,

17
00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.340
perfect teeth?

18
00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.690
Has anyone seen sort of stock photos for Paleo Diet magazines?

19
00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.380
We looked amazing
what happened.

20
00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.143
Um,

21
00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:22.980
I'm not sure that we can really say the Bacon Flavor cupcakes or the harbinger

22
00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.570
of the apocalypse,
but it might not be far off.
So there's,
there's a,

23
00:01:27.571 --> 00:01:29.220
I think a real sense that people have,

24
00:01:29.221 --> 00:01:33.450
which is that somewhere between technology and bacon flavored cupcakes,

25
00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.810
everything is killing us and it turns out that this is something we can actually

26
00:01:40.051 --> 00:01:43.500
do science about.
This is what I do,
um,

27
00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:47.520
is trying to explain how we got here,

28
00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:49.440
how are we got hunched over our phones,

29
00:01:49.441 --> 00:01:54.090
sort of worried about the size of the Dentin or office chair.
And it turns out,

30
00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:56.600
um,
it's kind of a long story.
Um,

31
00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.390
and the way I'm going to tell it is through my field of experience.

32
00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.510
I am a professional digger up of dead people.

33
00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.890
I am a bio archeologists.
This is a real job that you can actually have.

34
00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.410
Um,
and uh,
and so,
uh,

35
00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.810
this book is actually mostly about kind of the evidence from our actual

36
00:02:15.811 --> 00:02:17.820
skeletons from our actual bodies.

37
00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:23.450
That sort of speaks to how we have ended up as a nearly 60% urban species.

38
00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.570
So by 2030,
the idea is that human beings will be 60% urban.

39
00:02:30.571 --> 00:02:33.540
We are already majority urban dwelling species.

40
00:02:33.541 --> 00:02:37.350
This is pretty much the biggest change that we have made sense,
you know,

41
00:02:37.351 --> 00:02:41.250
some serious decisions about trees some time ago.
Um,

42
00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.480
and I'm going to try and tell this story mostly coherently.

43
00:02:45.481 --> 00:02:48.660
So we're going to have to start at the beginning and the beginning,
um,

44
00:02:48.661 --> 00:02:52.050
is probably best address.
This is not an archeological dig.

45
00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.540
This is archeologist digging out a car.
Um,

46
00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.130
I'm going to start in Jordan they see is a series of very prominent academics

47
00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:05.290
who study this sort of crucial change between the measle ethic and the
Neolithic.

48
00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:09.880
The muser lytic is our hunter gatherer days.
The Neil ethic is the fancy stuff.

49
00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:14.440
This is when we come up with a major changes which are settling down farming,

50
00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:15.940
domesticating animals.
Uh,

51
00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:20.110
but first you have to get there and it turns out Jordan is a wonderful place,

52
00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:22.840
but the roads don't always work.
Um,

53
00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:26.510
so we have really some quite prominent archeologist,
um,

54
00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:31.590
directing some less prominent archeologists as to how to dig a jeep out of a

55
00:03:31.691 --> 00:03:34.660
wadi and me taking photos because I'm helpful like that.

56
00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:36.280
So let's talk real estate.

57
00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:42.630
One of the first major changes that our species made was just settling down.

58
00:03:43.931 --> 00:03:48.670
We have been free range for a very long time,
200,000 years.

59
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.340
Uh,
well it depends on how far back into our history you want to go.

60
00:03:51.341 --> 00:03:55.930
But settling down is a pretty shocking change.
Uh,
yeah.

61
00:03:55.931 --> 00:03:57.940
And you can see here the reconstruction,
this is,

62
00:03:57.941 --> 00:04:02.710
I'm further up that not road and this is what he finance and Jordan and someone

63
00:04:02.711 --> 00:04:07.711
has made a reconstruction of what one of these very early year round dwellings

64
00:04:08.621 --> 00:04:09.454
would have looked like.

65
00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:12.580
They did not realize that if you put a fire in something without a chimney,

66
00:04:12.581 --> 00:04:13.960
it is not very good reconstruction.

67
00:04:13.961 --> 00:04:18.250
So they did nearly kill quite a few archeologists.
This would later rectified.
So,

68
00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:18.980
um,

69
00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:23.590
experimental archeology can be very exciting as Ken archaeology in general.

70
00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:26.800
So moving,
trying to move on.

71
00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:30.460
This is also what happens if you take prominent archeologist up a very steep

72
00:04:30.461 --> 00:04:34.060
road in Jordan.
And then it turns out that uh,

73
00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:38.920
some four by fours not actually meant for four by forging through Wattis and the

74
00:04:38.921 --> 00:04:43.180
battery will fall out and then you will have to bed when teenagers,

75
00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:46.840
the gentleman without shoes in the picture here,
um,

76
00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:51.730
who come and tell a room full of professors how to fix a Toyota.
Um,

77
00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:56.200
it is,
it is a remarkable experience being an archeologist.
Sometimes again,

78
00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:59.380
note my level of helpfulness.
I am in the back taking pictures.

79
00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:03.160
But this is so,
so this,

80
00:05:03.161 --> 00:05:08.161
this radical decision to stop wandering around actually has real physical

81
00:05:09.161 --> 00:05:13.450
effects and in sort of theory of if you don't use it,

82
00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:15.940
you lose it.
This applies to your skeleton.

83
00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:21.570
If you don't put constant pressure through use on the bones of your body,

84
00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:25.900
it's um,
you know what the bone doesn't feel much like building itself up.

85
00:05:25.901 --> 00:05:30.280
If you're not building up muscle and things,
you can actually lose bone density.

86
00:05:30.281 --> 00:05:34.180
And what we see by going around CT scanning,
x-raying,

87
00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:35.530
measuring very,

88
00:05:35.531 --> 00:05:40.531
very particularly is there is a change particularly in our lower legs when we go

89
00:05:40.961 --> 00:05:45.840
from wandering around to sitting still.
So this little diagram,
um,

90
00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:49.210
because I wanted to make sure you felt like you really got a lecture.

91
00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:51.820
So there are boring diagrams for you.
Um,

92
00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:56.140
this is kind of going through time period.
The very top there,
the CCR,

93
00:05:56.350 --> 00:06:00.770
that's the bone density of a cross country runner.
So if you see that line,

94
00:06:00.771 --> 00:06:03.770
that's the top,
that's actually that bone density is of your Shin,

95
00:06:03.771 --> 00:06:07.970
which is of course you know your Tibia as the bone,
you bark on coffee tables.

96
00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:10.420
It's a painful,
but,
um,

97
00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:14.330
but in a cross country runner that Tibi is really important.

98
00:06:14.331 --> 00:06:18.620
You actually build up more bone if you're an ultra marathon runner or um,

99
00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:21.590
you know,
professional running,
you need that Tibia.
So you have a much larger,

100
00:06:21.591 --> 00:06:23.120
but by the time we get to the Neolithic,

101
00:06:23.121 --> 00:06:27.170
you can see that first little t shape bar there.
That's a lower level.

102
00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:29.800
And then also for comparison,
we've got some,
I'm Adam,

103
00:06:29.801 --> 00:06:33.400
an islanders who are not living in totally settled life.
Um,
we've got,
uh,

104
00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:36.500
sedentary controls and then we've got field hockey players.

105
00:06:36.501 --> 00:06:39.450
I'm not sure why they included them,
but apparently not,

106
00:06:39.451 --> 00:06:40.550
not the strongest hippies in Rome.

107
00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:44.930
So we've already revolutionized our bodies just by selling down.

108
00:06:44.931 --> 00:06:47.180
We've got skinnier legs.
Well done us.

109
00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:52.700
I'm now going to move slightly further over and um,
just because I guess,

110
00:06:52.701 --> 00:06:57.260
well this is Google so we're going to go to Auntie Kythera and this,

111
00:06:57.590 --> 00:07:02.240
is anyone ever heard of anything involving computers?
Nantucket throw.
Yes.

112
00:07:02.241 --> 00:07:04.610
Thank you.
Thank you for nodding.
So,
um,

113
00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:08.330
the end and to kick through is mostly well known for a shipwreck that went down

114
00:07:08.331 --> 00:07:12.080
off side of it.
Um,
lots of things sink there.
Uh,

115
00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:15.630
for the end kits re mechanism,
which is occasionally brought out.
Um,

116
00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:19.530
and newspaper editors like to call it the world's first computer.
It is not a,

117
00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:23.720
it's cool.
It has gears a computer.
It is not,
but,
um,

118
00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:26.570
the reason I am telling you about an antiquey throw,
um,

119
00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:29.330
cause I had to spend a lot of time there and so we're going to spend a lot of

120
00:07:29.331 --> 00:07:32.120
time there.
Now.
It's a beautiful island.

121
00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:37.250
But the one thing about this wonderful,
amazing island,

122
00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:40.880
other than the fact that the boat is way bigger than the harbor,

123
00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.550
which means that the boat does not always make it into the harbor,

124
00:07:44.090 --> 00:07:48.980
which kind of sucks if you have 25 undergraduates and there's no more food,

125
00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:52.850
um,
hey,
get restless.
Um,

126
00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:57.110
it was actually kind of awesome.
I will say that,
um,
because this high,

127
00:07:57.111 --> 00:07:59.370
they don't think it's about 40 people living on it.
Um,
it's,

128
00:07:59.510 --> 00:08:02.450
it was completely abandoned,
cleared off by the Nazis and the Second World War,

129
00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:05.150
um,
it only is for the people living on it.
They're all elderly,

130
00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:08.780
none of them farm or do anything any more than involves making food to the food

131
00:08:08.781 --> 00:08:11.510
comes on the boat.
So if you take the only car,

132
00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:14.390
luckily there's only a mile of roads and no one really misses the car.
Um,

133
00:08:14.420 --> 00:08:18.420
but if you take a car to the big island to buy food and then you come back,
uh,

134
00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:22.430
and you can see the shore and you have the car full of food and you can see your

135
00:08:22.431 --> 00:08:23.850
undergrads and they're,

136
00:08:23.851 --> 00:08:27.260
they're kind of on the headlands waiting for the food and then the boat just

137
00:08:27.261 --> 00:08:27.981
doesn't land in,

138
00:08:27.981 --> 00:08:30.710
it turns around and goes to create and you have to have an enforced holiday in

139
00:08:30.711 --> 00:08:34.940
Crete.
Um,
when you come back there is anger.
Um,

140
00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:40.340
moving on.
It's a very harsh landscape.
It's quite a prickly landscape.

141
00:08:40.670 --> 00:08:45.080
Um,
it's actually sort of a more or less a barren rock and Molossia is quite

142
00:08:45.081 --> 00:08:46.540
difficult to live on.
Um,

143
00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:49.970
this was the situation we were reduced to trying to watch the World Cup.

144
00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:54.920
What you can't see is the coke cans and the clothes hangers wired into a fence

145
00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:58.680
in an attempt to boost the antenna almost worked.

146
00:09:00.090 --> 00:09:00.923
This

147
00:09:02.190 --> 00:09:05.490
is actually what I want to talk about and goats will be a major theme.

148
00:09:05.790 --> 00:09:09.990
Look out for goats where this a drinking game,
goats would definitely be a shot,

149
00:09:10.590 --> 00:09:13.290
but goats are the next step.

150
00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:18.440
So the goats on anti Kythera are basically a walking larder.

151
00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:23.910
They are or once were domesticated now that there's only 40 people to control

152
00:09:23.911 --> 00:09:26.910
them,
they kind of roam free.
They hide in abandoned villages.

153
00:09:26.911 --> 00:09:30.270
They peer at two from Ridge lines.
They're super threatening actually.
Um,

154
00:09:30.510 --> 00:09:35.510
but they were at one point moved to that island probably by one,

155
00:09:35.550 --> 00:09:39.750
potentially by Cretins or someone else and they were sort of held their and

156
00:09:39.751 --> 00:09:43.020
manage their in order to feed humans.

157
00:09:43.170 --> 00:09:48.170
These are domesticated animals and domesticated animals are a huge step for

158
00:09:49.411 --> 00:09:53.850
humans.
This is a very exciting,
you know,
meals on hooves.

159
00:09:54.420 --> 00:09:57.240
Yes.
We no longer have to go chasing these things.

160
00:09:57.480 --> 00:10:01.170
We can bring them into the house,
have them on hand,
you know,

161
00:10:01.171 --> 00:10:05.340
you're walking larder no longer is walking quite so far away or so fast.

162
00:10:06.030 --> 00:10:10.020
However,
is it a good idea to live in the same house as a goat?

163
00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:12.240
Possibly not.

164
00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:17.130
One of the things about the domestication of animals is that it puts us in very

165
00:10:17.131 --> 00:10:22.131
close contact with animals and also puts us in very close contact with secondary

166
00:10:22.681 --> 00:10:26.640
products.
These are and everything you get out of an animal that isn't me.

167
00:10:26.641 --> 00:10:30.000
So milk for leather,
all of these things,

168
00:10:30.810 --> 00:10:35.710
milk in particular and the Mediterranean specifically has been a longterm

169
00:10:35.730 --> 00:10:40.730
problem because goats have something called brucellosis and brucellosis.

170
00:10:41.790 --> 00:10:45.870
We'll do this to your spine in case anyone's wondering.

171
00:10:45.930 --> 00:10:49.590
Your spine should not be riddled with holes that is not normal,

172
00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:52.980
it should not look like that.
And this was actually a huge problem,

173
00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:58.050
only finally solved by pasteurization,
which got rid of the brucellosis bacteria.

174
00:10:58.350 --> 00:10:59.183
But um,

175
00:10:59.250 --> 00:11:04.250
we see evidence of brucellosis entering the human skeletal record with the sort

176
00:11:06.421 --> 00:11:07.740
of domestication of animals.

177
00:11:08.010 --> 00:11:12.120
So great job finding a new source of food,

178
00:11:12.690 --> 00:11:17.010
but stair is still a potential for it to either kill you or at least make life

179
00:11:17.070 --> 00:11:20.790
dramatically uncomfortable.
Going back to dramatically uncomfortable.

180
00:11:21.510 --> 00:11:22.860
We will go back to central trick.

181
00:11:22.861 --> 00:11:26.380
A lot of my work is in central Turkey and the sort of um,

182
00:11:26.550 --> 00:11:29.280
large agrarian planes,
central Anatolia.

183
00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:34.020
And this is a Shiklah Hayek,
which I think is pretty much the coolest guy ever.

184
00:11:34.050 --> 00:11:35.370
So you will all be forced to agree.

185
00:11:35.750 --> 00:11:40.380
And this is a reconstruction of a Neolithic village.
So finally,

186
00:11:40.381 --> 00:11:45.150
combining all of these sort of them Neolithic things that we've done with

187
00:11:45.151 --> 00:11:48.770
settling down domesticating animals and um,

188
00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:51.780
domesticating something else,

189
00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:55.150
which is of course what the Paleo Diet would have you believe.

190
00:11:55.210 --> 00:11:59.140
He's killing you right now.
Um,
this is wheat.

191
00:11:59.170 --> 00:12:04.170
Well that's Mu Gay and knew gay is tending to her experimental crop of Neolithic

192
00:12:05.981 --> 00:12:09.340
wheat.
So not are not content with building an experimental village.

193
00:12:09.341 --> 00:12:12.190
We've now got more gay doing experimental week.
Um,

194
00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:15.070
and I have to admit the thing you learned about Neolithic farming,

195
00:12:15.071 --> 00:12:19.060
is it boring because I watch me,
okay,
do this for like hours.
And then I was like,

196
00:12:19.061 --> 00:12:21.100
no,
I really have to go now.
Um,

197
00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:25.990
because what I'm interested in is not just,
you know,

198
00:12:25.991 --> 00:12:29.680
the sort of invention of Wheaton,
how people did it,
but what it did to us,

199
00:12:30.340 --> 00:12:33.430
and this is where we come to my actual real sort of scientific specialty,

200
00:12:33.431 --> 00:12:37.720
which is in fact teeth,
dental,
tissue analysis.
Um,
but for your sake,

201
00:12:37.721 --> 00:12:39.220
we are not going to go deep into that.

202
00:12:39.910 --> 00:12:44.910
But teeth are probably one of the most obvious places to look for changes that

203
00:12:45.401 --> 00:12:46.540
happened with a neolithic.

204
00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:51.960
The way we eat changes in what I would like to call the pot noodle phenomenon.

205
00:12:54.730 --> 00:12:59.730
We move from a very sort of quite a big variety of foods to something that might

206
00:13:01.301 --> 00:13:04.660
have quite a lot of carbs in it and carbs that don't require a lot of
processing,

207
00:13:04.661 --> 00:13:09.520
don't require a lot of chomping with the reduction of sort of,

208
00:13:09.670 --> 00:13:12.970
you don't use it,
you lose it sort of phenomenon.

209
00:13:13.570 --> 00:13:17.290
You get a slow reduction probably in the size of your job.

210
00:13:17.830 --> 00:13:21.880
How many of you were,
um,
have wisdom teeth yet?

211
00:13:22.150 --> 00:13:26.230
Yet increasingly people are born without wisdom teeth.

212
00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:29.680
If you don't have room in your diet as possible for the wisdom teeth,

213
00:13:29.681 --> 00:13:34.660
just to not form that is one of the major evolutionary changes that is happening

214
00:13:34.661 --> 00:13:37.000
to our species right now.
We are losing a tooth.

215
00:13:37.330 --> 00:13:41.080
There are people born without wisdom teeth and presumably without attending sort

216
00:13:41.081 --> 00:13:42.310
of pain and dental bills.

217
00:13:43.030 --> 00:13:47.140
So teeth are actually incredibly interesting of the story and I could go on like

218
00:13:47.141 --> 00:13:50.530
a lot longer.
But for your sake,
I won't.
Um,

219
00:13:50.890 --> 00:13:55.600
some other things that agriculture has allegedly done to us.

220
00:13:55.930 --> 00:14:00.430
And this one is fairly,
or like a,
you know,
there's,
there's a smoking gun here.

221
00:14:00.820 --> 00:14:01.653
Uh,

222
00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:05.260
there are some things wrong with his dentition besides obviously the fact that

223
00:14:05.261 --> 00:14:07.690
it is not in a person anymore.
Um,

224
00:14:08.590 --> 00:14:10.990
there are giant gaping holes in the teeth.

225
00:14:11.410 --> 00:14:14.980
This is caused by bacteria.
These are carries.

226
00:14:15.550 --> 00:14:19.780
If you were allowed to just eat bacon flavored cupcakes,

227
00:14:20.020 --> 00:14:21.820
this is pretty many never brushed your teeth.

228
00:14:22.330 --> 00:14:24.160
This is pretty much what would happen to you.

229
00:14:24.161 --> 00:14:28.150
So the change in our diet actually changes the bacteria in our mouth and the way

230
00:14:28.151 --> 00:14:31.300
it's able to affect our teeth.
We get rotten teeth.

231
00:14:31.540 --> 00:14:35.200
So we've got shrinking jars and rotting teeth so far,

232
00:14:35.201 --> 00:14:39.400
the Neil ethics looking great.
Now it's looking shiny.

233
00:14:40.060 --> 00:14:43.810
This is a tooth.
Take my word for it.
Um,

234
00:14:44.050 --> 00:14:48.490
this is actually a sputter coated lightly sputter coat in about micron of gold

235
00:14:48.491 --> 00:14:53.270
cast of a tooth.
Um,
this canine.
So your big sort of vampire teeth,

236
00:14:53.930 --> 00:14:57.110
your teeth,
her fossils,
they formed when you're a kid.
Um,

237
00:14:57.120 --> 00:14:59.420
there are a perfect record of everything you do.

238
00:14:59.421 --> 00:15:02.330
So if you break a bone in its back together,
yeah,
we're pretty much,

239
00:15:02.450 --> 00:15:06.320
we believe that chip a tooth no,
doesn't happen.

240
00:15:06.830 --> 00:15:07.880
That's just expensive.

241
00:15:08.180 --> 00:15:11.150
So your teeth had these wonderful fossils and they have a record of growth.

242
00:15:11.151 --> 00:15:15.920
So can you just about make out the horizontal lines that are created that are

243
00:15:15.921 --> 00:15:20.330
crossing that tooth.
Your tooth is like a tree.

244
00:15:20.331 --> 00:15:21.260
You have tree rings,

245
00:15:21.261 --> 00:15:25.280
these are actually visible on the outside of your tooth with the sort of bill

246
00:15:25.281 --> 00:15:28.640
tools.
If you brush your teeth,
they're probably gone by now.
So sorry,

247
00:15:28.641 --> 00:15:31.490
before you go home and go like,
oh,
I didn't grow.
Um,

248
00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:35.930
I hope you brushed your teeth.
I really advocate doing that.
Um,
but this,

249
00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:41.320
at those lines for what is about every week and that gives us a record of growth

250
00:15:43.131 --> 00:15:45.140
from about one year to six.

251
00:15:45.710 --> 00:15:50.710
So we can actually look at that and work out not only sort of your growth

252
00:15:50.751 --> 00:15:53.570
pattern,
but when growth stopped,

253
00:15:54.020 --> 00:15:57.260
can you see the big giant Gash that's like on the top third of the teeth.

254
00:15:57.440 --> 00:16:00.770
There's a big gaping line.
Something bad happened,

255
00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:04.520
something happened to that kid where resources going into growth stopped.

256
00:16:05.030 --> 00:16:08.510
Common causes would be disease,
malnutrition and particularly fevers.

257
00:16:08.990 --> 00:16:12.200
So those are reasons why you would have these lines on teeth.

258
00:16:12.650 --> 00:16:17.650
And what we can do is survey these lines on teeth and start building up like a

259
00:16:18.321 --> 00:16:23.321
population level picture of when kids are getting sick and try and look at

260
00:16:25.371 --> 00:16:28.500
whether those kids are getting sick pretty much all at the same time.
Um,

261
00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:31.970
which might indicate it's something to do with the way their lives go.

262
00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:37.360
And what we find in the Neolithic is a story that we can probably best explained

263
00:16:38.271 --> 00:16:41.110
going all the way over to Paraguay.
Um,
these are,
uh,

264
00:16:41.170 --> 00:16:45.490
chain indigenous people from Paraguay and they are trying to illustrate my
point.

265
00:16:45.510 --> 00:16:49.880
That's obviously why they post for this picture.
Um,
they,
uh,

266
00:16:49.881 --> 00:16:50.870
in the 1970s,

267
00:16:50.871 --> 00:16:55.730
the RJ who had been a hunter gatherers were forcibly settled and moved into a

268
00:16:55.731 --> 00:16:59.090
totally sedentary,
totally agriculturally based life.

269
00:16:59.590 --> 00:17:04.590
They are Chang generally as hunter gatherers had children about four years

270
00:17:05.451 --> 00:17:06.980
apart.
Um,

271
00:17:07.130 --> 00:17:10.520
if you've ever tried carrying a toddler and an infant at the same time,

272
00:17:10.850 --> 00:17:15.680
you will understand why if you try doing this in a like rain forest where you

273
00:17:15.681 --> 00:17:17.390
need your hands to also get food,
I mean,

274
00:17:17.391 --> 00:17:21.110
you will understand that four years is cutting it fine.
Um,

275
00:17:21.650 --> 00:17:25.130
in sort of in normal childbearing practice and went hunting and gathering went

276
00:17:25.131 --> 00:17:26.120
out in the jungle,
you know,

277
00:17:26.121 --> 00:17:29.420
the child doesn't get more than a meter away from the mom.
However,

278
00:17:29.540 --> 00:17:32.480
when they moved to settled commendations,

279
00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:36.820
suddenly you could have multiple children sort of around one seven,
you know,

280
00:17:37.250 --> 00:17:39.890
one grandma or Auntie sitting there.

281
00:17:40.460 --> 00:17:42.260
And the birth spacing decreases.

282
00:17:42.790 --> 00:17:46.400
It goes to about 2.5 2.7 years on average between siblings.

283
00:17:47.030 --> 00:17:52.030
So we see you can have more babies and this is kind of the story of the

284
00:17:53.971 --> 00:17:54.804
Neolithic.

285
00:17:55.080 --> 00:18:00.060
We have never done anything that is so good for building more humans than just

286
00:18:00.061 --> 00:18:04.710
sitting down and making more babies.
Um,
and it's made a huge,

287
00:18:04.740 --> 00:18:07.490
huge difference in our lives.
Said this is Chad [inaudible],

288
00:18:07.530 --> 00:18:12.120
which is another one of these neolithic sites also central Anatolia about a

289
00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:12.953
thousand years later.
Um,

290
00:18:13.470 --> 00:18:17.460
and this is really coming into the time of villages and villages are very

291
00:18:17.461 --> 00:18:21.780
exciting by the way.
There's almost no gaps between these buildings.

292
00:18:21.870 --> 00:18:25.050
So those ladders you see are actually how you would move around.

293
00:18:25.051 --> 00:18:27.870
You get on top of the roof and walk around on top of other people's houses.

294
00:18:28.420 --> 00:18:31.770
I saw that,
act it out once.
It was hilarious.
Um,
so we kind of,

295
00:18:31.771 --> 00:18:36.510
villages and villages are where we start to get new stories and they also have

296
00:18:36.511 --> 00:18:37.380
an impact on us.

297
00:18:37.860 --> 00:18:42.860
This rather unprepossessing picture contains some of the most sort of,

298
00:18:44.401 --> 00:18:45.234
um,

299
00:18:45.780 --> 00:18:50.250
well pernicious and deadly evidence for things that we later come up with on our

300
00:18:50.251 --> 00:18:54.210
journey to urbanism.
Okay.
It looks like dirt.
It was dirt,

301
00:18:54.900 --> 00:18:57.060
but that dirt is a series of small walls,

302
00:18:57.061 --> 00:19:00.790
which has Eddie Izzard is informed us as the entire point of archeology.
Um,

303
00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:05.340
but here,
does this work?
Oh,
it does?
Okay.
Um,

304
00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:11.310
these are storage bins,
storage bins,

305
00:19:11.580 --> 00:19:13.110
the Tupperware of the Neolithic,

306
00:19:13.620 --> 00:19:18.090
not very interesting at sort of first glance and second glance and when you have

307
00:19:18.091 --> 00:19:22.340
to draw it and when you have to dig it.
But when the,

308
00:19:22.380 --> 00:19:24.570
in the village,
in the Neolithic village,

309
00:19:24.571 --> 00:19:28.140
we see a movement from communal activity,

310
00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:31.980
a egalitarian societies feasting together,

311
00:19:32.070 --> 00:19:36.480
sharing resources.
You can have sort of a special person,

312
00:19:36.481 --> 00:19:37.590
like a shaman or something.

313
00:19:37.591 --> 00:19:39.780
And in the gala Terrian society gala Terrian just means,
you know,

314
00:19:40.050 --> 00:19:42.600
everyone's equal.
While they say it means everyone's equal.

315
00:19:42.601 --> 00:19:46.200
It's like Barbara still gets screwed on the whole deal.
A while,
frank,

316
00:19:46.201 --> 00:19:51.130
it was like,
ah,
everyone's favorite.
Um,
but you move in the Neolithic,

317
00:19:51.140 --> 00:19:56.140
you move from a relatively egalitarian society to a society where resources are

318
00:19:57.931 --> 00:20:01.320
no longer held in public these storage bins or in a house.

319
00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:05.580
That house is accessible by one group of people,
not by everyone.

320
00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:08.520
You start to see orphans,
places where you would do cooking,

321
00:20:08.820 --> 00:20:11.130
moved from outside to inside.

322
00:20:11.490 --> 00:20:16.490
And you start to see a series of small walls and these walls build up

323
00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:19.740
differences in access,
access to resources.

324
00:20:20.070 --> 00:20:25.070
And this is kind of wrote inequality and the road to cities that pretty much

325
00:20:25.651 --> 00:20:29.040
hangs over everything else we've done for the last,

326
00:20:29.250 --> 00:20:34.020
let's go with about 9,000 years.
Um,
you start to get,
uh,

327
00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:38.670
in temples there's a special room or special people can talk to the gods.
Uh,

328
00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:41.880
and you know,
there's a special storage room where only your family can go.

329
00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:44.160
This is what we're talking about in terms of access.

330
00:20:44.161 --> 00:20:48.460
We can see it in the archeological record through walls and we can start to see

331
00:20:48.461 --> 00:20:49.960
it three and material culture.

332
00:20:49.990 --> 00:20:54.250
This is the standard of or the royal standard of or which is very exciting.
Um,

333
00:20:54.310 --> 00:20:58.840
if you're me and this I think you can all see this is,
um,

334
00:20:58.870 --> 00:21:03.010
this is from about,
well,
4,500 years ago,
quite old.

335
00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:08.020
Um,
can you see there's one dude who's bigger than the rest of the dudes.

336
00:21:08.710 --> 00:21:11.320
That is the important guy.
That is the important guy.

337
00:21:11.321 --> 00:21:14.470
And this is what we're talking about.
We're talking about hierarchies.

338
00:21:14.471 --> 00:21:19.390
The hierarchy is necessary to get all of those human beings to live together,

339
00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:23.860
result in someone being at the top register of that standard.

340
00:21:24.310 --> 00:21:28.530
Also their goods.
So the,
this sort of,
um,

341
00:21:28.810 --> 00:21:31.870
this,
this inequality and access resources,
again,

342
00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:36.580
we can actually start tracking and skeletons to access resources includes access

343
00:21:36.581 --> 00:21:41.140
to food.
This is your skull.
It's not your go,

344
00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:43.900
let's hope it's not your skill.
Um,
what is quite difficult to see.

345
00:21:43.901 --> 00:21:45.400
But you can just about make out,

346
00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:48.220
she sees little pinprick holes and things that are here.

347
00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:51.490
This is a very small,

348
00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:54.250
delicate sign that you have scurvy,

349
00:21:55.450 --> 00:21:57.040
vitamin deficiencies.

350
00:21:57.280 --> 00:22:01.810
If you do not have access to a wide and varied diet because you are not the dude

351
00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:06.010
at the top of the chain,
you can start to see nutritional deficiencies.

352
00:22:06.010 --> 00:22:09.610
And we actually start to see these at the sort of beginning of urbanism.

353
00:22:09.970 --> 00:22:13.000
So there's scurvy,
everyone's favorite rickets.

354
00:22:13.810 --> 00:22:17.530
Rickets is a disease of childhood.
When you don't have enough vitamin D,
uh,

355
00:22:17.531 --> 00:22:20.620
your bones are sort of the mineralized and when they're growing to mineralized,

356
00:22:21.060 --> 00:22:25.210
um,
just the weight of walking on them.
Bose,
the amount of shapes.

357
00:22:25.211 --> 00:22:27.990
So this sort of typical bowed legs of Rick,

358
00:22:27.991 --> 00:22:31.690
it's actually caused by the weight on the skeleton and these,

359
00:22:31.691 --> 00:22:35.500
these bones not being really properly mineralized.
So they sort of bend slightly.

360
00:22:35.980 --> 00:22:38.050
Uh,
the good news is you can mineralize those bounds,

361
00:22:38.051 --> 00:22:40.180
but you can't really get them back into shape.

362
00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:45.160
So we start to see evidence of vitamin deficiencies.

363
00:22:46.420 --> 00:22:48.790
And of course there are other things that inequality leads to,

364
00:22:48.791 --> 00:22:51.070
which is go back to standard of,

365
00:22:51.071 --> 00:22:55.840
or someone is more important than you.
Someone wants what you have.

366
00:22:56.050 --> 00:23:00.550
I'm pretty sure this guy at the bottom here did not choose to end up in this

367
00:23:00.551 --> 00:23:01.384
position.

368
00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:05.830
And this is the story of violence.

369
00:23:05.860 --> 00:23:10.000
This is the story of humans being terrible humans.

370
00:23:10.001 --> 00:23:14.560
I think we all are aware of the sort of,
um,
axiom that humans and aggregate suck.

371
00:23:14.890 --> 00:23:19.480
Um,
I don't think that's been disproved yet,
but,
um,

372
00:23:19.900 --> 00:23:24.520
we start to think about cities and we start to think about,
um,

373
00:23:24.730 --> 00:23:28.900
the kind of violence inherent in so many people living together.

374
00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:34.420
Uh,
and in our defense,
chimps are way worse.
Chimps,

375
00:23:34.421 --> 00:23:37.300
her terrible,
terrible people.
They're also terrible.

376
00:23:37.301 --> 00:23:39.730
Chimps actually just chimps are terrible.
Um,

377
00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:44.710
so actually this is actually a really big question is how violent are we?
I mean,

378
00:23:44.711 --> 00:23:48.310
compared to sort of other mammals and primates and thanks.
And,
um,

379
00:23:49.100 --> 00:23:51.950
how long have we been that terrible?
So this,

380
00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:57.070
this is a bone well spotted.
Um,
it's from semen,
deloss voices,

381
00:23:57.140 --> 00:24:01.910
which is a pit of bones,
which is in Burger House in Spain.

382
00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:06.110
That is huge,
caustic region.
It's got caves everywhere full of dead people.
Very,

383
00:24:06.111 --> 00:24:09.740
very old dead people are not necessarily people,
but hominins.

384
00:24:09.741 --> 00:24:14.741
So people came before I said this is from a homo antecessor site and a bunch of

385
00:24:15.801 --> 00:24:20.030
bodies were found in a cave
with cut marks

386
00:24:21.620 --> 00:24:24.830
850,000 years ago before neanderthals,

387
00:24:24.831 --> 00:24:29.831
before we even got around to sort of being properly sophisticated and having

388
00:24:29.901 --> 00:24:33.560
royal standards of,
or people were terrible people.

389
00:24:34.550 --> 00:24:39.550
So there is a long evolutionary history of violence and conspecific violence,

390
00:24:40.191 --> 00:24:44.600
which is just fancy way of saying,
you know,
human on human.
Um,

391
00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:46.580
so I mean,

392
00:24:46.581 --> 00:24:50.300
are we really that bad given the chimpanzees will kill anything?

393
00:24:50.360 --> 00:24:53.360
It's going to have a chance.
I'm very mean about chimpanzees.

394
00:24:53.361 --> 00:24:56.120
I'm slightly scared of,
I'm sorry.
Um,
you know,

395
00:24:56.121 --> 00:24:59.060
and that we have a long evolutionary history of violence.

396
00:25:00.590 --> 00:25:04.220
And this is another thing that by archeologists can look at.
Um,

397
00:25:04.250 --> 00:25:06.920
this is your skull.
This is your skull on violence.

398
00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:11.930
That is a depressed skull fracture.
Um,

399
00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:16.130
so where are you to be hit aggressively on the head with something you would end

400
00:25:16.131 --> 00:25:18.470
up with a fracture in your skull?

401
00:25:18.471 --> 00:25:23.471
I think the surprises now when this picture actually is interesting because this

402
00:25:23.541 --> 00:25:28.040
is a healed depressed skull fracture.
If you were to find fresh,

403
00:25:28.070 --> 00:25:31.670
sharp edges,
it would be something that had happened recently at,

404
00:25:31.671 --> 00:25:35.630
especially if it's sort of punctured in through the brain.
Um,

405
00:25:35.780 --> 00:25:40.570
person would have died.
It,
uh,
so now you're all qualified for forensics.
Um,

406
00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:44.000
but this is healed.
You can see the soft edges where the bone is slowly net over.

407
00:25:44.350 --> 00:25:47.930
And the story depressed skull fracture is actually really interesting.

408
00:25:47.930 --> 00:25:51.030
It's one of the first things that I was interested in.
Um,

409
00:25:51.080 --> 00:25:54.410
when I started this whole archeology Larc,
I grew up in California.

410
00:25:54.411 --> 00:25:56.450
You may be able to tell that from the accent or not.

411
00:25:56.480 --> 00:25:59.960
I've been here for some time.
Um,
but,
uh,

412
00:25:59.961 --> 00:26:04.470
California is home to the Chumash Indians and they,
uh,

413
00:26:04.490 --> 00:26:07.760
sort of cover an area from Malibu to sort of up through Santa Barbara.

414
00:26:07.761 --> 00:26:12.530
So obviously a terrible place to do field work.
Um,
and one of the,

415
00:26:12.531 --> 00:26:15.590
one of the first papers I read was about this woman,

416
00:26:16.190 --> 00:26:20.210
this whose skull was found.
And the Chumash are these excellent.

417
00:26:20.211 --> 00:26:24.470
They live on the coasts.
They're,
they're basically sort of,
um,
they invent money.

418
00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:28.280
They sort of live in one place,
but they're not really urban people.

419
00:26:28.430 --> 00:26:33.170
They're just kind of chilling with boats and stuff because it's California.
Um,

420
00:26:33.740 --> 00:26:36.410
and so then there's this one lady there and they found her skull and she has

421
00:26:36.411 --> 00:26:41.360
nine depressed skull fractures.
I thought that was very interesting.
Why,

422
00:26:41.361 --> 00:26:44.550
you know,
what in your life happens that you,
this many depressed skull fractures,

423
00:26:44.551 --> 00:26:46.440
we know that,
you know,
they can be,

424
00:26:46.441 --> 00:26:49.800
signs of violence are associated with things like domestic abuse.

425
00:26:49.890 --> 00:26:50.970
Before we invented cars,

426
00:26:50.971 --> 00:26:55.860
basically all depressed skull fractures were pretty much violence or falling.
Um,

427
00:26:55.890 --> 00:27:00.570
but falls are unlikely.
So this one I had nine.
And um,
it's uh,

428
00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:04.290
find that paper explained that I'm farther north and a different grapes and

429
00:27:04.410 --> 00:27:05.580
highly judgey.

430
00:27:05.581 --> 00:27:10.581
Spanish friars had observed and grape if native settle an argument and what they

431
00:27:11.881 --> 00:27:13.390
had done was sort of two,

432
00:27:13.450 --> 00:27:18.450
two people would sort of face off and each one would have in their hand a

433
00:27:18.601 --> 00:27:21.780
spatula.
It's like a sweat scraper.

434
00:27:21.781 --> 00:27:23.940
It's basically stick with possibly a shell on the end.
It is,

435
00:27:23.941 --> 00:27:25.650
it is actually a slightly permittable weapon.

436
00:27:26.070 --> 00:27:28.790
But what they would do is they'd face each other and they'd sort of,
um,

437
00:27:29.310 --> 00:27:32.790
to settle the argument,
they would each take a swing snack

438
00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:38.790
and whoever drew blood one argument was settled,
everything was peaceful.

439
00:27:41.540 --> 00:27:45.590
And I just,
I,
I'm,
this woman had nine such depressed skull fractures,
like wow,

440
00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:47.880
way to hold true on an argument.
You know,

441
00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:50.930
you obviously survived at least the first date.
Um,

442
00:27:51.360 --> 00:27:56.360
but actually this is kind of belying the underlying story of violence like this,

443
00:27:56.700 --> 00:28:00.660
which is that we see evidence of violence in the skeletal record,

444
00:28:01.050 --> 00:28:04.740
but it's not necessarily the sort of,
um,
massive competition that sort of,

445
00:28:04.950 --> 00:28:09.840
you know,
wars of conquest.
A lot of it seems to happen at times of instability.

446
00:28:09.841 --> 00:28:14.841
So we see depressed skull fracture is actually less in the early,

447
00:28:15.390 --> 00:28:16.380
early cities.

448
00:28:16.620 --> 00:28:20.940
They are more frequent sort of prior to or when cities are collapsing,

449
00:28:20.941 --> 00:28:23.980
when urban civilizations are really collapsing.
Um,

450
00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:29.580
so it's possible that actually as people move together,

451
00:28:29.780 --> 00:28:33.720
it becomes less important to actually bash someone over the head then to just

452
00:28:33.721 --> 00:28:35.760
look like you're capable of doing it.

453
00:28:36.390 --> 00:28:40.230
And this is the idea that as we sort of move into a more urban world,

454
00:28:40.380 --> 00:28:43.290
in order to cooperate,
in order to get that many people to live together,

455
00:28:43.710 --> 00:28:46.320
as long as you sort of,
you know,
walk softly,

456
00:28:46.321 --> 00:28:49.350
carry a big stick but don't actually hit anyone with it,
um,

457
00:28:49.500 --> 00:28:53.700
it's actually much more conducive to a larger group of people living together.

458
00:28:53.850 --> 00:28:56.990
So this is the site that I currently work at,
which is my favorite science.

459
00:28:56.991 --> 00:28:59.990
So you can see a lot of it.
Um,
this is Basher Hayek.
Uh,

460
00:29:00.030 --> 00:29:03.600
currently we're not digging because it's about hour and a half drive from the

461
00:29:03.601 --> 00:29:07.900
Iraq,
Syria border in Turkey.
And it's not a good scene.
Um,

462
00:29:08.340 --> 00:29:12.620
these are spearheads,
these guys,
this is like a pile of spearheads.

463
00:29:12.621 --> 00:29:16.800
So you might think,
okay,
dig up a grave,
tons of spearheads warrior,
right?

464
00:29:17.010 --> 00:29:19.890
Then you get me,
I show up on site.
I'm like,
no,
there's are two 12 year old kids.

465
00:29:20.370 --> 00:29:25.360
Sorry.
And then you have to sit back and think why,
you know,

466
00:29:25.560 --> 00:29:26.640
have we got all these spirits?

467
00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:31.170
And it might be that actually spearheads are more worthwhile as sort of an idea

468
00:29:32.020 --> 00:29:33.300
there.
They're actually more worthwhile.

469
00:29:33.301 --> 00:29:36.630
It's something that you could exchange and impress people with than his actual

470
00:29:36.631 --> 00:29:39.240
weapons of war because cities need to bling.

471
00:29:39.540 --> 00:29:40.950
This is a very important part of cities.

472
00:29:40.951 --> 00:29:44.110
You impress your other urban elites without mad bling,

473
00:29:45.460 --> 00:29:48.850
goats,
goat bling.
It exists.

474
00:29:49.210 --> 00:29:52.300
It's actually very impressive in case anyone wants to know.
Um,

475
00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:56.050
we killed very few people,
uh,
on this expedition.

476
00:29:56.051 --> 00:29:59.230
I'd like to point out that this is basically how all of this information gets

477
00:29:59.231 --> 00:30:02.110
retrieved.
Um,
both of these archeologists lived,

478
00:30:02.710 --> 00:30:07.230
it was 50 degrees in our defense.
Um,
and this was all excavated highly sort of,

479
00:30:07.231 --> 00:30:12.231
I'm efficient team working very hard not to constantly chain smoking in like

480
00:30:13.261 --> 00:30:17.370
trench and with modern techniques that really sort of,
um,

481
00:30:17.950 --> 00:30:21.030
to be fair to me,
actually the entire thing is recorded.
Photogram uh,

482
00:30:21.070 --> 00:30:24.820
photograph metrically and will be built into was sort of astounding.

483
00:30:24.821 --> 00:30:27.340
3D which actually looks quite cool and spins around in the sauce and their

484
00:30:27.341 --> 00:30:31.480
drones.
Um,
but also there are some practical issues just with digging.

485
00:30:32.110 --> 00:30:33.790
The other cool thing that is on the site,

486
00:30:34.090 --> 00:30:35.680
and I don't know if you can actually make it out,

487
00:30:35.681 --> 00:30:39.310
but what they are digging is a mass death pit,

488
00:30:40.270 --> 00:30:44.350
which brings us to other questions of human violence,

489
00:30:44.351 --> 00:30:48.790
which don't involve one person smacking the other with a spatula.

490
00:30:49.150 --> 00:30:51.670
They involve more concentrated violence.

491
00:30:51.671 --> 00:30:54.450
So is it true that cities are,

492
00:30:54.460 --> 00:30:59.080
when we get big scale community violence,
let's ask Germany.

493
00:30:59.920 --> 00:31:02.830
This is a very pleasant place in Germany,
um,

494
00:31:03.220 --> 00:31:07.300
except for in the Neolithic.
It might have sucked to live there.

495
00:31:08.290 --> 00:31:10.930
The towel high massacre is now relatively well known,

496
00:31:10.931 --> 00:31:14.160
but until fairly recently people assumed the Neolithic,

497
00:31:14.270 --> 00:31:16.600
that sort of happy village time.
Um,
it is,

498
00:31:16.601 --> 00:31:21.601
it has been accused of being this sort of yogurt crocheting zenith of a

499
00:31:21.970 --> 00:31:24.280
archeological theory that essentially,
you know,

500
00:31:24.281 --> 00:31:27.100
in the past everyone sat around crocheting their own yogurt and that was,

501
00:31:27.120 --> 00:31:29.530
you know,
a thing.
And it turns out now,

502
00:31:29.531 --> 00:31:33.190
they also committed huge massacre occurs with their farming implements,

503
00:31:33.191 --> 00:31:34.690
wiping out entire communities.

504
00:31:35.560 --> 00:31:40.560
So the history of people killing and wiping out entire other communities.

505
00:31:42.010 --> 00:31:45.140
This is actually tell home is much more recent than,
um,

506
00:31:45.260 --> 00:31:46.840
there's a site near Lake Turkana,

507
00:31:47.050 --> 00:31:51.100
which has certainly been suggested to be a Masker of 26 people,
um,

508
00:31:51.190 --> 00:31:53.830
with Arrow heads,
with blunt force trauma.

509
00:31:54.130 --> 00:31:56.410
And that's dated 10,000 years ago,

510
00:31:56.411 --> 00:32:00.520
well before any villages even in that area.

511
00:32:00.790 --> 00:32:05.790
So we do know actually that people are terrible people.

512
00:32:07.420 --> 00:32:11.650
And one of the things that,
um,
sort of been pointed out is that actually,

513
00:32:12.490 --> 00:32:12.820
you know,

514
00:32:12.820 --> 00:32:17.820
modern warfare might kill less people as a percentage of the population that

515
00:32:19.691 --> 00:32:22.840
exist in total.
Even despite this,

516
00:32:22.841 --> 00:32:26.530
what a mass casualties and the horrific things that happened around the world

517
00:32:27.010 --> 00:32:32.010
that we actually might kill less people now than we did as angry little

518
00:32:32.231 --> 00:32:33.760
villagers.
Um,

519
00:32:33.820 --> 00:32:36.280
and there's a paper in nature it back me up on this so you don't have to believe

520
00:32:36.281 --> 00:32:40.760
me.
Um,
this more boring charts for you.
You're welcome.
Um,

521
00:32:41.960 --> 00:32:46.700
that's us.
We're over there.
Um,
and that is chimps.

522
00:32:47.090 --> 00:32:51.500
I am totally,
totally justified in saying chimps are terrible.
Um,
but uh,

523
00:32:51.730 --> 00:32:54.320
just as a general animal,
this is a nature paper from last year.

524
00:32:54.620 --> 00:32:56.120
Just as a general animal,

525
00:32:56.420 --> 00:33:01.060
you have more or less violent tendencies and these are measuring conspecific

526
00:33:01.061 --> 00:33:04.010
specific killings.
So you know,
species on species violence.

527
00:33:04.310 --> 00:33:08.510
So the more terrestrial you are,
the more territorial you are.
Things like that,

528
00:33:08.990 --> 00:33:12.410
different ways of organizing yourself.
And if we take this back into the past,

529
00:33:12.560 --> 00:33:17.560
now you don't have to read that and just realize that this is an arc.

530
00:33:17.960 --> 00:33:21.920
This is an art going up.
So starting at the very beginning from the Paleolithic,

531
00:33:21.950 --> 00:33:25.370
which is all the way over there,
and it goes up like this.

532
00:33:25.460 --> 00:33:30.260
This is Europeans coming to North America.

533
00:33:31.010 --> 00:33:33.800
That is the best we ever got at killing,

534
00:33:34.700 --> 00:33:37.490
wiping out huge numbers of human beings.

535
00:33:38.270 --> 00:33:40.160
But we have got better our,

536
00:33:40.180 --> 00:33:45.180
our levels of how many people are killed by people are actually more similar to

537
00:33:45.861 --> 00:33:50.570
where they were in the Paleolithic than where they were in the medieval era.

538
00:33:52.100 --> 00:33:55.460
So we don't need to jump off bridges just yet.

539
00:33:56.510 --> 00:34:00.680
There's another thing about urban style conflict though that we do have to think

540
00:34:00.681 --> 00:34:04.210
about.
This is what a Mongol siege looks like.
Um,

541
00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:06.230
many of you will not have seen one of these in real life.

542
00:34:06.231 --> 00:34:10.610
So I provided a picture.
Um,
it is not the actual siege of Kaffa,

543
00:34:10.640 --> 00:34:13.390
but um,
it is there to illustrate the points.

544
00:34:13.390 --> 00:34:18.390
So Catherine was an Italian trading outpost more or less on the Silk Road.

545
00:34:18.830 --> 00:34:22.430
The Mongols were less interested in this being there or they just wanted it or

546
00:34:22.431 --> 00:34:24.290
something and they started attacking.

547
00:34:24.620 --> 00:34:29.450
Unfortunately this was in the mid 14th century and they all got very sick.

548
00:34:29.960 --> 00:34:33.280
The besieging army was suddenly struck down with some sort of terrible pasture

549
00:34:33.281 --> 00:34:38.281
lands and they decided that the best possible option because they were all going

550
00:34:39.441 --> 00:34:44.180
to die and they hadn't managed to take half of which just start chucking the

551
00:34:44.181 --> 00:34:48.710
dead bodies over the walls into Cafa.
Um,

552
00:34:48.980 --> 00:34:52.680
and that's giving us our first,
well first known,
um,

553
00:34:52.681 --> 00:34:54.680
example of biological warfare.

554
00:34:55.100 --> 00:34:59.050
And of course what did they have in sort of,
um,
you know,

555
00:34:59.060 --> 00:35:00.830
they made 14th century,

556
00:35:01.160 --> 00:35:06.160
this was black death and that is actually very much a city story.

557
00:35:07.430 --> 00:35:11.960
So they is an urban trading city,
this genuine and they are,

558
00:35:12.770 --> 00:35:14.040
they have this little trade out post.

559
00:35:14.240 --> 00:35:17.390
Their city requires trade in order to survive.

560
00:35:17.600 --> 00:35:22.190
The economics of Urbanism Require Routes,
trade,

561
00:35:22.670 --> 00:35:27.110
um,
all of the things that move people and goods in order to survive.

562
00:35:27.111 --> 00:35:29.540
That's what an urban economy needs even in the medieval period.

563
00:35:29.840 --> 00:35:33.560
And what else moves on roads,
diseases and armies.

564
00:35:34.130 --> 00:35:36.290
Now for our college is actually plague is very difficult.

565
00:35:36.291 --> 00:35:39.720
It's very annoying because until the advent of modern genome sequencing,

566
00:35:40.140 --> 00:35:41.940
we were really bad at finding it.

567
00:35:41.941 --> 00:35:44.100
There's no way to tell because played kills you quickly.

568
00:35:44.460 --> 00:35:47.430
Unlike some of the other fund diseases which kill you very slowly and make

569
00:35:47.431 --> 00:35:50.940
changes to your skeleton.
Plague kills you quickly.
Um,

570
00:35:50.970 --> 00:35:53.910
but we can dig them up in Nice little neat rows.

571
00:35:53.911 --> 00:35:56.250
This is from the royal mint side in London.
By the way.

572
00:35:56.251 --> 00:35:59.040
There are huge plague pits all over London,
like everywhere,

573
00:35:59.160 --> 00:36:01.710
like under Liverpool Street station,
like anyone who has to go through there,

574
00:36:02.120 --> 00:36:07.050
a lot of plague.
Uh,
you're fine now.
It's not contagious.
Going back to armies,

575
00:36:07.080 --> 00:36:09.810
armies carry other things.
Um,

576
00:36:10.440 --> 00:36:14.670
armies are full of,
well traditionally men,

577
00:36:15.120 --> 00:36:18.300
uh,
but they are also generally accompanied by other professionals.

578
00:36:18.930 --> 00:36:23.400
And one of the things that,
um,
we're still baffles archeologists,

579
00:36:23.940 --> 00:36:28.170
uh,
is a story that sort of begins with the siege of Naples,

580
00:36:28.220 --> 00:36:29.880
like sort of begins in the new world.

581
00:36:30.150 --> 00:36:33.180
Then there's some Columbus action and then nobody knows what happens.

582
00:36:33.181 --> 00:36:36.120
But by the siege of Naples,
which is depicted here,

583
00:36:36.510 --> 00:36:39.480
there is an army that is marching and he's marching with a new disease,

584
00:36:39.630 --> 00:36:41.910
which is going to make everyone freak out.

585
00:36:42.300 --> 00:36:44.910
And this is syphilis.

586
00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:48.810
Syphilis is bad for you don't get syphilis.

587
00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:53.370
This is actually third stage syphilis.
So syphilis,
uh,
if,
if you're interested,

588
00:36:53.700 --> 00:36:56.790
um,
actually can lie dormant for quite some time.

589
00:36:56.940 --> 00:37:01.940
So many people would have died of other things well before the syphilis got this

590
00:37:02.071 --> 00:37:06.030
nasty,
but this is properly nasty and we actually recognize it through this

591
00:37:06.031 --> 00:37:07.140
characteristic appearance,

592
00:37:07.380 --> 00:37:11.560
like hardened chewing gum on the SCO called carries sicker.
Um,

593
00:37:11.561 --> 00:37:14.580
so syphilis or something by rocky,
just like,
cause we can diagnose it.
It's like,

594
00:37:14.581 --> 00:37:18.750
yes,
great.
I know what this is.
Next one.
Oh,
I don't know.
Um,

595
00:37:19.230 --> 00:37:20.160
I feel bad for Mr. Norris,

596
00:37:20.161 --> 00:37:23.600
who's actually the surgeon who collected this and not the civil lytic.
But yeah,

597
00:37:25.110 --> 00:37:27.810
problem with syphilis of course,
is that they thought mercury cured it.

598
00:37:28.620 --> 00:37:31.590
Hence the amusing catch phrase a night with Venus,

599
00:37:31.830 --> 00:37:36.360
a lifetime with mercury awkwardly.
Mercury makes you go crazy,

600
00:37:36.900 --> 00:37:40.700
but so does neurosyphilis.
So it was kind of a tossup,

601
00:37:40.710 --> 00:37:44.280
which one would kill you?
Mercury poisoning or the neurosyphilis.

602
00:37:44.281 --> 00:37:46.470
But I kind of think if you've got the point of being mad,

603
00:37:46.590 --> 00:37:49.680
the mercury might've been just a relief at some point.

604
00:37:50.460 --> 00:37:52.890
So coming into kind of the story of modern cities,

605
00:37:52.891 --> 00:37:56.130
we've talked about diseases that are moving between cities and the sort of

606
00:37:56.160 --> 00:38:00.900
increasingly globalized,
sort of acquisitive,
you know,
sea routes and roads.

607
00:38:01.400 --> 00:38:05.100
Um,
there are other things in the city that can kill you.

608
00:38:05.490 --> 00:38:07.230
One of which is working,

609
00:38:08.340 --> 00:38:13.200
working can be a t o the city is an incredibly exploitative economy that eats up

610
00:38:13.230 --> 00:38:15.750
people.
That is what urban economies do.

611
00:38:15.751 --> 00:38:17.730
They draw in more people in for long time.

612
00:38:17.940 --> 00:38:21.730
London killed way more people than it grew.
Um,

613
00:38:21.750 --> 00:38:25.530
it just ate immigrants from everywhere and it brought them in and it put them to

614
00:38:25.531 --> 00:38:28.380
work in places like match factories,
matches.

615
00:38:28.410 --> 00:38:29.850
You should be made white phosphorous.

616
00:38:30.210 --> 00:38:33.550
You should not hang out with white phosphorous.
It is not good for you.
Um,

617
00:38:33.600 --> 00:38:36.010
these are two gentlemen.
If you see these little,
um,

618
00:38:36.490 --> 00:38:39.970
weird sort of wooden boards that they've got,
those are matchsticks.

619
00:38:40.210 --> 00:38:43.840
What they're going to do is take the match sticks and dip them in white

620
00:38:43.841 --> 00:38:46.270
phosphorous so that the heads have white phosphorous.

621
00:38:46.271 --> 00:38:50.740
So they are hanging out over an open vat of white phosphorous.

622
00:38:52.180 --> 00:38:54.580
This is your jaw on white phosphorous.

623
00:38:55.210 --> 00:38:59.680
This is a bone necrosis,
uh,
where the bone is died.

624
00:38:59.830 --> 00:39:02.710
Those are so much poison,
has been taken out,
the bonus and actually rotted away.

625
00:39:03.040 --> 00:39:06.190
Um,
we like to take our students to see these and tell them that it glows in the

626
00:39:06.191 --> 00:39:08.860
dark.
It doesn't,
but that's all right.

627
00:39:09.940 --> 00:39:14.110
But so the work can kill.
Everything,
can kill you.
Everything is killing you.

628
00:39:14.140 --> 00:39:15.070
Back to my original point,

629
00:39:15.910 --> 00:39:20.560
but this is actually where I get slightly more optimistic,
which is essentially

630
00:39:22.570 --> 00:39:25.330
in the sort of late Victorian era,

631
00:39:26.290 --> 00:39:29.740
people refuse to be killed by white phosphorous.

632
00:39:30.550 --> 00:39:34.180
It was in a city,
you know,
the,
these horrible working conditions,

633
00:39:34.870 --> 00:39:37.990
they're actually fixed in a city.
So we had the match girl strike,

634
00:39:37.991 --> 00:39:42.550
which actually a very impressive early strike and it got such a tension.

635
00:39:42.910 --> 00:39:44.620
These poor people who were being exploited,

636
00:39:44.621 --> 00:39:48.040
they have these terrible working conditions and they're dying from their work

637
00:39:48.340 --> 00:39:51.970
and it leads to strikes and it leads to progressive change.

638
00:39:52.240 --> 00:39:56.760
It leads to 1912 the banning of white phosphorous.
So it,

639
00:39:56.790 --> 00:39:59.410
it is sort of,
it's a horrible story,

640
00:40:00.010 --> 00:40:04.630
but there is little room for hope and just go to the sort of very last bit

641
00:40:05.650 --> 00:40:08.290
because cities obviously are continuing to killing you.

642
00:40:08.860 --> 00:40:11.020
The other way they're killing you is because they are polluted.

643
00:40:11.290 --> 00:40:16.030
If anyone has tried to breathe in London recently,
you may be aware of this fact.

644
00:40:16.390 --> 00:40:19.390
Um,
and uh,
and actually I,
I'm not,

645
00:40:19.391 --> 00:40:23.350
I'm not too sure there's room for optimism on that,
but um,
back,

646
00:40:23.650 --> 00:40:27.130
back in then I said,
well,
go back to the 19th century and water supply.

647
00:40:27.131 --> 00:40:28.750
The Romans had a great water supply.

648
00:40:29.380 --> 00:40:31.300
The Victorians had totally forgotten about this,

649
00:40:31.301 --> 00:40:34.630
that they just ignored it and made their own and it didn't work very well.

650
00:40:35.140 --> 00:40:39.520
And this is a contemporary cartoon showing all of the horrific things that are

651
00:40:39.521 --> 00:40:43.150
going into the Thames and then coming out in your drinking water.

652
00:40:43.570 --> 00:40:46.030
And we come to this map.

653
00:40:46.750 --> 00:40:49.180
This map is one of the most famous maps,
um,

654
00:40:49.330 --> 00:40:51.430
for all of sort of health professionals.

655
00:40:51.880 --> 00:40:55.210
This is Jon snow's map up dead people.

656
00:40:56.590 --> 00:41:01.590
There was a cholera epidemic in Soho and it killed a lot of people.

657
00:41:03.190 --> 00:41:07.990
Um,
and there was a big conversation about how you got cholera.

658
00:41:07.991 --> 00:41:10.120
You've got cholera.
Everyone thought it was a Miasma,

659
00:41:10.180 --> 00:41:14.890
which is this like sort of specter of this cloud of noxious fumes.
Sort of like,

660
00:41:14.891 --> 00:41:17.010
um,
if you've heard of people in the black death,
um,

661
00:41:17.050 --> 00:41:20.380
fighting the plague with like posies with burning herbs and things.

662
00:41:20.381 --> 00:41:23.080
It's the smell that gets you,
this was a really current medical theory.

663
00:41:23.380 --> 00:41:26.220
John Snow was like,
no,
it's water.
Don't drink the water.
And everyone's like,

664
00:41:26.590 --> 00:41:30.100
shut up,
you know,
nothing.
Jon Snow,
sorry.
Sorry,
my friend,

665
00:41:30.130 --> 00:41:33.600
my friend came up with that joke and I've stolen it.
Oh.
Um,

666
00:41:34.070 --> 00:41:35.990
but so Johnstone,
he sort of,

667
00:41:35.991 --> 00:41:40.010
he actually gets aggressive and so he starts mapping the deaths.

668
00:41:40.640 --> 00:41:45.560
So he's drawing out these little blocks or the number of dead people and
they're,

669
00:41:45.561 --> 00:41:47.780
they're also surrounded in an area.
Okay,
that makes sense.

670
00:41:47.781 --> 00:41:52.430
It could be just noxious air in one area,
but
weirdly,

671
00:41:52.460 --> 00:41:57.460
the people in the workhouse who have their own well are fine and the brewery

672
00:41:58.851 --> 00:42:00.710
workers aren't fine.

673
00:42:02.330 --> 00:42:03.860
And this is because of course,

674
00:42:03.950 --> 00:42:07.880
the source of contamination is a pump,

675
00:42:08.210 --> 00:42:10.220
which is bringing out the cleric water.

676
00:42:10.340 --> 00:42:13.850
The brewery workers are fine because they're drinking beer because why would you

677
00:42:13.851 --> 00:42:15.470
drink lemon water?
That is a terrible idea.

678
00:42:16.160 --> 00:42:21.160
And because of this you get major structural change.

679
00:42:21.650 --> 00:42:24.650
And this kind of my point with cities just to stop everyone from like jumping

680
00:42:24.651 --> 00:42:25.910
off a bridge,
um,

681
00:42:26.750 --> 00:42:30.470
we do fix the problems of cities in cities.
Uh,

682
00:42:30.500 --> 00:42:33.110
Jon snow went through the waterboard.
There are,
you know,

683
00:42:33.140 --> 00:42:37.640
this is where the solutions to the problems that cities come up with come from

684
00:42:37.850 --> 00:42:42.510
their urban problems,
but it doesn't mean that we're totally doomed.
Um,

685
00:42:43.550 --> 00:42:44.450
there are choices,

686
00:42:45.260 --> 00:42:50.030
there are choices that we can make probably whether we want to go like full

687
00:42:50.180 --> 00:42:54.680
dystopia.
Um,
I really enjoyed mad max,
don't want to live in it.

688
00:42:55.080 --> 00:42:56.780
Um,
or you know,

689
00:42:56.781 --> 00:43:00.500
whether we want to let 'em Patrick Stewart lead us into sort of the future.

690
00:43:01.190 --> 00:43:05.870
I'd say I'm way more on the star Trek Front.
Um,
but there are options,

691
00:43:07.070 --> 00:43:11.260
right.
I will happily take questions,
um,

692
00:43:11.900 --> 00:43:15.710
answer anecdote,
quite related queries.
Um,

693
00:43:17.750 --> 00:43:21.220
<v 1>Yep.
Sorry.</v>

694
00:43:23.750 --> 00:43:26.810
<v 0>Yeah,
just curious.
Could could have it go differently,</v>

695
00:43:27.410 --> 00:43:30.720
like evolution and everything.
Like what was it she didn't back then?
I think,

696
00:43:30.721 --> 00:43:34.140
I think there were a lot of options.
Um,

697
00:43:34.360 --> 00:43:37.940
I mean it's kind of a deep philosophical question,
sort of can't,
you know,

698
00:43:37.960 --> 00:43:41.430
could anything have gone differently and probably there are other multiple

699
00:43:41.431 --> 00:43:45.290
universes where we're still wandering around doing other things.
But,
um,

700
00:43:45.900 --> 00:43:50.040
I think farming's actually at this sort of idea of the Neolithic of sitting,

701
00:43:50.041 --> 00:43:54.060
settling down and sort of living year round is something that people tried

702
00:43:54.061 --> 00:43:55.290
several times.

703
00:43:55.920 --> 00:43:59.730
So I think we would have always eventually kind of done that.
So there's,

704
00:43:59.731 --> 00:44:03.540
there's actually no evidence that people were sort of messing around with

705
00:44:03.541 --> 00:44:07.500
breeding grains and stuff from I think at like 23,000 years ago,

706
00:44:07.740 --> 00:44:11.430
which is 10,000 earlier than we knew,
but they gave it up.

707
00:44:12.210 --> 00:44:16.470
So it's possible that we actually always would have eventually gotten to this

708
00:44:16.471 --> 00:44:20.190
point.
Um,
but we just,
you know,
we sort of failed a couple of times.

709
00:44:23.080 --> 00:44:25.510
Other than the wisdom teeth you mentioned earlier,

710
00:44:25.660 --> 00:44:28.420
are there any other factors of our lives done now,

711
00:44:28.421 --> 00:44:31.350
which you think the archeologists of the future will be taking up?

712
00:44:31.550 --> 00:44:36.550
And we were having this conversation earlier because I am a text walker and um,

713
00:44:36.901 --> 00:44:39.480
so there's,
there's a combination of things that you just worry about.
You know,

714
00:44:39.481 --> 00:44:43.470
what your neck and your thumb are doing when you're sort of doing this and

715
00:44:43.471 --> 00:44:46.200
whether it,
most of us will end up under buses because we aren't,
you know,

716
00:44:46.201 --> 00:44:50.130
answering some sort of,
uh,
you know,
email or something.
Uh,

717
00:44:50.460 --> 00:44:53.100
it's difficult to know what will affect your skeleton.

718
00:44:53.101 --> 00:44:56.580
I think one of the things that,
um,
we will certainly notice,

719
00:44:56.940 --> 00:45:01.860
it's the number of surgical interventions we will be found with stainless steel,

720
00:45:01.861 --> 00:45:04.260
hip joints and stents,

721
00:45:04.261 --> 00:45:08.560
places and all sorts of interventions.
Uh,

722
00:45:08.790 --> 00:45:12.870
now we've got to the point where actually a lot of the early surgical,
um,

723
00:45:12.871 --> 00:45:17.580
sort of experiments are now archaeological.
There are no longer sort of modern,

724
00:45:17.581 --> 00:45:22.020
but there there's sort of historical enough that we have excavated,
you know,

725
00:45:22.021 --> 00:45:25.910
some of the pioneering surgeons early work and you sort of go,
Ooh,
ah,

726
00:45:25.950 --> 00:45:28.080
glad you practice on dead people.
Um,

727
00:45:28.650 --> 00:45:33.420
so I think we'll probably see increasing signs of human intervention.
Uh,

728
00:45:33.720 --> 00:45:35.490
I think our faces are slowly shrinking.

729
00:45:35.491 --> 00:45:38.430
I'm slightly concerned we are going to end up looking like little gray aliens,

730
00:45:38.431 --> 00:45:42.390
you know,
with the giant skull and the big eyes.
Cause we're super into neoteny,

731
00:45:42.810 --> 00:45:46.350
which is the word for babies are cute.
Um,
yeah,

732
00:45:46.380 --> 00:45:47.700
it's not really high transit anyway.

733
00:45:48.090 --> 00:45:51.270
The same reason that your dog does not look like a wolf.
It looks like a puppy.

734
00:45:51.810 --> 00:45:55.300
And the reason that we find kittens are adorable.
It's,
uh,

735
00:45:55.560 --> 00:45:58.800
supposed to be something that's built in so that because we favor big eyes.

736
00:45:58.801 --> 00:46:01.290
If you look at a baby,
a third of their faces,

737
00:46:02.160 --> 00:46:06.420
which is terrifying unless it's a baby,
in which case it's adorable.

738
00:46:06.780 --> 00:46:10.020
So we actually are supposed to really favor that as a look.

739
00:46:10.220 --> 00:46:13.770
You look at child actors,
many of them have really outsize eyes.

740
00:46:14.040 --> 00:46:18.330
It's something that we find adorable.
Um,
but if we keep on going,

741
00:46:18.331 --> 00:46:22.620
we're gonna run out of jar.
They mostly I and apparently adorable and babies,

742
00:46:22.621 --> 00:46:26.220
but terrifying when it's in a space ship.
So yeah,
not sure what,

743
00:46:26.370 --> 00:46:27.203
what's up with that.

744
00:46:33.680 --> 00:46:38.300
<v 2>So maybe I just grabbed the long emergency with a little bit too much interest,</v>

745
00:46:38.301 --> 00:46:40.130
but I find the idea of,
um,

746
00:46:40.430 --> 00:46:45.430
civilizations collapsing quite interesting and sort of looking at the examples

747
00:46:46.011 --> 00:46:47.180
that I've seen throughout history,

748
00:46:47.181 --> 00:46:51.500
it seems to happen with much more regularity than modern people.
Imagine.

749
00:46:51.501 --> 00:46:52.251
It does.

750
00:46:52.251 --> 00:46:56.330
And I was wondering through your long view of the historical perspective,

751
00:46:56.540 --> 00:47:00.680
do you think that our current civilization or collection of civilizations is due

752
00:47:00.681 --> 00:47:05.330
to last forever?
Or are we how quite you or any pork or

753
00:47:06.020 --> 00:47:10.780
<v 0>isn't this is every pub conversation I've had since recent elections.
Um,</v>

754
00:47:11.430 --> 00:47:15.440
I can tell from my accent,
I am American.
Um,

755
00:47:15.530 --> 00:47:17.270
and I'm in a passport here too.
So it's,

756
00:47:17.271 --> 00:47:20.900
it's a conversation that certainly topical and,

757
00:47:20.910 --> 00:47:22.550
and one of the interesting things is,

758
00:47:23.290 --> 00:47:27.590
which keeps me from actively pursuing sort of life under a bus.
Um,

759
00:47:28.010 --> 00:47:32.080
his collapsed doesn't kill everyone.

760
00:47:33.370 --> 00:47:34.780
What we think of collapse.

761
00:47:34.781 --> 00:47:39.770
You can almost kind of see as Emma is this kind of old fashion,
um,

762
00:47:40.060 --> 00:47:45.060
Marxist idea of a revolution where the gears of society and Economics and stuff,

763
00:47:45.191 --> 00:47:48.550
we're sort of mushed in one way and eventually a gear strips.

764
00:47:49.030 --> 00:47:53.530
That's revelation and something happens to change,
but it doesn't kill everyone.

765
00:47:53.531 --> 00:47:57.190
It doesn't destroy everything.
Uh,
we think of,
for instance,

766
00:47:57.191 --> 00:48:01.120
the fall of Rome as a terrible,
terrible thing.
Yeah.

767
00:48:01.360 --> 00:48:05.430
If you were a Roman elite,
turns out for like visit Goss.
It was a great day.
Um,

768
00:48:05.520 --> 00:48:05.840
you know,

769
00:48:05.840 --> 00:48:10.840
they say is not necessarily the end of everything and a lot of things that we

770
00:48:11.081 --> 00:48:13.030
used to think about the dark ages,
you know,

771
00:48:13.031 --> 00:48:17.440
that we'd lost all of the great knowledge of classical world.

772
00:48:17.890 --> 00:48:22.120
No,
it just wasn't easily available.
It was still hanging out somewhere else.

773
00:48:22.121 --> 00:48:25.480
A lot of,
um,
the sort of lost knowledge of classics and things.
They were,

774
00:48:25.481 --> 00:48:28.840
you know,
in North Africa,
in Iran,
places like this.

775
00:48:29.260 --> 00:48:31.630
So when we look at collapse,

776
00:48:31.631 --> 00:48:35.230
you can say there are some really terrifying possibilities,

777
00:48:35.590 --> 00:48:40.390
especially given that someone has a briefcase that can end the world.

778
00:48:40.720 --> 00:48:43.270
I feel like that is not a happy thought,

779
00:48:43.810 --> 00:48:48.810
but we haven't actually managed to massively sink ourselves.

780
00:48:49.121 --> 00:48:51.670
We have certainly managed to upend political orders.

781
00:48:51.910 --> 00:48:55.600
And you do have situations where,
you know,
um,
where,

782
00:48:55.610 --> 00:48:59.890
where I dig in Turkey,
uh,
it is pretty much agrarian,

783
00:48:59.891 --> 00:49:03.340
nowhere land.
It is almost a hundred percent goat population,

784
00:49:03.760 --> 00:49:05.710
but it used to be a major trading point.

785
00:49:05.711 --> 00:49:09.070
You used to be a massively important notice sort of transit.

786
00:49:09.310 --> 00:49:12.550
So things do change and they don't always necessarily change for the better for

787
00:49:12.551 --> 00:49:13.780
those of us who are at the top now.

788
00:49:14.920 --> 00:49:19.640
So it's how you feel you can adapt to that.
And I think,
um,

789
00:49:19.930 --> 00:49:22.840
strategies for adapting to that are really what we want to be thinking about

790
00:49:23.200 --> 00:49:26.260
this.
I'm not necessarily,
how do I live in the coming Dystopia,
you know,

791
00:49:26.261 --> 00:49:30.160
will I need radiation protection?
But,
um,
you know,
uh,

792
00:49:30.640 --> 00:49:33.430
what comes next?
What other organizations follow after this,

793
00:49:33.431 --> 00:49:38.200
this gear slips because it will eventually have slip.
Well,

794
00:49:38.800 --> 00:49:40.990
thank you very much,
Brenda.
That was fascinating that you wrote

795
00:49:41.760 --> 00:49:44.660
<v 1>[inaudible].</v>
