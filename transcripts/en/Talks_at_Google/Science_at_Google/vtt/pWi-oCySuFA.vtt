1
00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:10.270
I have heard that people at Google are extremely smart,
talented,

2
00:00:10.271 --> 00:00:13.900
and very good with numbers.
I'm a neuroscientist.

3
00:00:13.901 --> 00:00:16.420
I love to see for myself.
That's really true.

4
00:00:16.421 --> 00:00:19.270
So I'd like to ask 10 people to come over here.

5
00:00:19.271 --> 00:00:22.780
We're going to do a little competition and put this to a test,
please.

6
00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:27.550
Otherwise,
I'm just going to take the first rows.

7
00:00:27.551 --> 00:00:30.160
If nobody dares you guys here already doomed.

8
00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:34.810
So five people over here,
five people over there,

9
00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.710
three,
four.
Okay.
Five people.
That's five people.

10
00:00:41.711 --> 00:00:45.220
Good to people here.
We need three more.

11
00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:50.290
Okay.
Here's what we're gonna do.
Um,

12
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.290
we're going to work in two competing teams.

13
00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:56.170
I'm going to start with the first team over here,

14
00:00:56.171 --> 00:00:58.750
and you guys are not supposed to talk to each other.

15
00:00:58.751 --> 00:01:02.230
You just watch them and white that they make a mistake,
okay?

16
00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.200
I'm not as good with numbers,
so I need your guys' help.

17
00:01:05.201 --> 00:01:07.690
If anybody makes a mistake,
led me know,

18
00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:11.290
could you please form a circle and Natalia will be in the middle.

19
00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:16.590
So all you have to do is to count to 100 okay?

20
00:01:17.171 --> 00:01:18.370
Can we just give it a try?

21
00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:22.780
<v 2>One,
three,
four,
five,</v>

22
00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.310
<v 1>six.
Okay.
Okay.
You can count.</v>

23
00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:26.163
<v 0>That's good.</v>

24
00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:29.950
<v 1>So super smart.</v>

25
00:01:29.951 --> 00:01:34.690
Supposedly I would like to introduce three simple rules.
Okay.

26
00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:37.810
The first one is called the evil number seven.

27
00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:43.410
So don't say any number that has a seven and it's like 67 or [inaudible] 87 or

28
00:01:44.231 --> 00:01:45.064
something like this.

29
00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:50.430
Don't say any number where the multiple and where that is a multiple of seven

30
00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:55.590
such as I'm 77 or 49 don't say any number where the two digits add up to seven

31
00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:04.540
such as in 52 you guys are supposedly smart,
right?
So

32
00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.640
when such a number comes up and it's your turn,

33
00:02:09.641 --> 00:02:12.580
and let's take you more in the middle so that you're not confused as a

34
00:02:12.581 --> 00:02:14.120
participant.
Great.

35
00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:18.310
So when such a number comes up,

36
00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:22.870
what you should be doing is instead of saying the number,

37
00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:26.680
you swirl around your own access,
can you do it like this?

38
00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.330
And when you're back here facing the others,
you clap your hand.
Can you do once?

39
00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:36.220
And then the third rule is your team must reverse directions.

40
00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:41.000
Okay?
We just try it quickly.
So you go first one.
No

41
00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.350
<v 0>[inaudible]</v>

42
00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.210
<v 2>four five,
six and then you,</v>

43
00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:58.060
<v 1>and then do your reverse directions.
Okay.
You got it.
Oh,</v>

44
00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:02.200
the rules clear.
Please watch them.
I'm not such a number person.

45
00:03:02.201 --> 00:03:07.060
So ready,
set,
go.
One,
two,
three,
four,

46
00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.960
five,

47
00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:08.793
<v 0>six,</v>

48
00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:15.970
<v 1>10,
11,
12,
13.</v>

49
00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:19.183
<v 0>Okay.</v>

50
00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.180
<v 1>1516</v>

51
00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:25.370
<v 0>oh,
okay.
Let's give them an applause.</v>

52
00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:34.550
<v 1>Just stay here for a moment.
Not,
don't talk down.
Outsmart me.</v>

53
00:03:34.551 --> 00:03:38.840
Don't make up any smarts.
Redditers please.
Let's see if you can do any better.

54
00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:44.480
We've taken marina in the middle so you just hide here.
Okay.

55
00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:49.030
Okay.
Ready?
Set,
go to sweet.

56
00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:58.600
<v 0>[inaudible]</v>

57
00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:06.660
<v 1>you can all go back to your seats again.</v>

58
00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:13.770
What did we just experience here?

59
00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:18.800
Why was it so hard to count to 100 and why would that matter to you?

60
00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:24.540
Right.
Who cares if they can come to 100 I will tell you why.

61
00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:28.920
I will give you a closer look at how the brain works to understand what just

62
00:04:28.921 --> 00:04:33.810
happened and also to help you understand how you can use that knowledge to

63
00:04:33.811 --> 00:04:36.750
improve your performance.
Okay.
At any time,

64
00:04:36.751 --> 00:04:39.480
feel free to interrupt me and to ask questions.

65
00:04:39.481 --> 00:04:42.180
I love questions and I love to be challenged.

66
00:04:42.181 --> 00:04:45.840
So if something is unclear or you have a little question,

67
00:04:45.841 --> 00:04:49.740
just raise your hands and you will get a microphone and you can ask right away.

68
00:04:49.741 --> 00:04:52.350
So don't wait to the very end.
I'm flexible.

69
00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:57.000
So use the action,
the possibility to ask right away.

70
00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:02.240
So if this is the head and you can see it from the side with the eyes here and

71
00:05:04.711 --> 00:05:05.640
this is your brain,

72
00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:11.210
there's a part of the brain called the pre frontal cortex,

73
00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:16.200
Pfc.
That's the part of the brain that makes you successful.

74
00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:20.730
That's the part of your brain that you use for complex decision making,

75
00:05:20.731 --> 00:05:25.590
rational sinking planning perhaps with the future that toward your need in order

76
00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:28.380
to be a high performing person.

77
00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:34.130
Researchers found that already at age five you can see if children have well

78
00:05:34.891 --> 00:05:36.690
developed prefrontal cortices.

79
00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:40.380
And what they did is they made an experiment where they had people,

80
00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:44.580
our children sit down in a chair,
in a laboratory setting and they said,

81
00:05:44.581 --> 00:05:49.320
you can get one marshmallow now and they put it in front of them or you can wait

82
00:05:49.321 --> 00:05:54.321
for 15 minutes and then you can get a second marshmallow if you manage to wait

83
00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:56.700
for those 15 minutes.

84
00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:01.130
Well then the research has left the room and left the kid alone with a

85
00:06:01.131 --> 00:06:02.510
marshmallow for 15 minutes.

86
00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:06.230
You would see some kids that would run for the marginal lunch,
just eat it,

87
00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:07.520
get it over with.
Right.

88
00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:12.110
And some others that would turn around ignore the marshmallow or put it under

89
00:06:12.111 --> 00:06:16.370
the table so they didn't have to see it or play with it and throw it in the air.

90
00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:17.960
Crazy things happened.

91
00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:23.270
But what research has found that the kids that were able to wait for just 15

92
00:06:23.271 --> 00:06:27.830
minutes to get a second marshmallow were the ones that were way more successful

93
00:06:27.831 --> 00:06:31.250
later in life.
They had their earned more money,

94
00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:35.720
they had better jobs that have better health,
they were happier overall.

95
00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:40.340
So success in life is correlated with how well your prefrontal cortex is

96
00:06:40.341 --> 00:06:43.530
functioning because it's your prefrontal cortex that helps you,

97
00:06:43.531 --> 00:06:46.520
helps you to make executive decisions,

98
00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:49.610
and it helps you to have executive control.

99
00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:55.570
When we did this little experiment over here and I introduced the rules with the

100
00:06:55.881 --> 00:07:00.881
evil number seven and the swirling around and not seeing the number and then

101
00:07:01.851 --> 00:07:03.320
reversing directions,

102
00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:08.800
this was a task aimed to test or to freak out your prefrontal cortex.

103
00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:14.750
You had to use your prefrontal cortex to manage these different rules and to do

104
00:07:14.751 --> 00:07:19.160
these calculations in your hat.
The problem is as we know,

105
00:07:19.161 --> 00:07:23.930
the prefontal cortex sales very quickly,
right?

106
00:07:23.931 --> 00:07:27.620
And we could all see it here.
Um,
so

107
00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:32.990
we like to think of ourselves as rational beings.

108
00:07:32.991 --> 00:07:37.820
We think that we're so smart and we are always in control of things and we're so

109
00:07:37.821 --> 00:07:40.190
rational,
but that's not how our brains work.

110
00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:43.970
But in order to be successful in life and in order to be innovative,

111
00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:46.970
in order to create new ideas and to be high performing,

112
00:07:47.210 --> 00:07:49.340
you will need your prefrontal cortex.

113
00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:54.260
So I will show you today how you can improve your prefrontal cortex.

114
00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:58.490
But before that I will show you which other brain areas always run over the

115
00:07:58.491 --> 00:08:02.540
prefrontal cortex because it's a part of our brain that was only fully
developed.

116
00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:05.510
Um,
you know,

117
00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:08.180
at age 18 or 21 for you,

118
00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:12.800
maybe some of you guys here don't even have a fully developed prefrontal cortex.

119
00:08:13.010 --> 00:08:17.250
If I look at the audience,
it's a part of our brain that,
um,

120
00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:20.450
is the newest from an evolutionary perspective.

121
00:08:20.870 --> 00:08:24.750
And it's also the one that takes longest to grow.
So,
you know,

122
00:08:24.770 --> 00:08:29.770
I have five kids at home under the age of six and they do crazy stuff and I

123
00:08:29.871 --> 00:08:34.580
said,
stay relaxed because I know it's just that their prefrontal cortex is not

124
00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:37.280
working fully yet.
So,

125
00:08:37.310 --> 00:08:41.690
which are the brain parts run over the prefontal cortex.

126
00:08:42.110 --> 00:08:44.600
There are many other areas that influence it.

127
00:08:44.601 --> 00:08:49.340
But I'd like to highlight one today that we could see in our little exercise and

128
00:08:49.341 --> 00:08:52.550
that really determines much of what's going on in our lives.

129
00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:59.550
It's a part of lower brain called the Basal Ganglia.

130
00:09:00.030 --> 00:09:04.920
What are the Basal Ganglia?
That's where your habits are stored.

131
00:09:05.130 --> 00:09:08.970
That's where your mindsets are stored.
That's where your belief system is in.

132
00:09:08.971 --> 00:09:13.110
So if you think that Brexit is a good idea or that voting for a certain

133
00:09:13.111 --> 00:09:13.980
political parties,

134
00:09:13.981 --> 00:09:17.760
a good idea that's probably stored in your basal Ganglia and your brain,

135
00:09:18.270 --> 00:09:21.930
when you have lots of experience,
it goes into your basal Ganglia.

136
00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:24.630
If you think about the the game we did

137
00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:30.660
it aimed also at your basal Ganglia because what did you do that you learned at

138
00:09:30.661 --> 00:09:35.310
age two or three or one
counting?

139
00:09:35.311 --> 00:09:38.400
All of you know how to count and the better you know how to count,

140
00:09:38.610 --> 00:09:41.730
the more it is represented in your Basal Ganglia.

141
00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:44.220
And once it's something is in your Basal Ganglia,

142
00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:46.320
you don't get rid of it anymore.

143
00:09:46.710 --> 00:09:50.490
Once you know how to ride a bike or once you know how to count,

144
00:09:50.491 --> 00:09:53.940
you can't unlearn it.
Once it's there,
you're stuck with it,
okay?

145
00:09:53.941 --> 00:09:56.820
And it will overrule everything else in your brain.

146
00:09:56.910 --> 00:10:00.840
So you need to be aware also of habits you create because they can be very

147
00:10:00.841 --> 00:10:04.110
stubborn.
To illustrate this.
If you think about it,

148
00:10:04.111 --> 00:10:06.720
the first time you learned how to drive a car,

149
00:10:07.140 --> 00:10:08.910
maybe at your first driver's license,

150
00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:12.990
that was really something that required a lot of attention.

151
00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:17.010
You had to focus on the wheel.
You had to focus on pushing the brakes.

152
00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:21.990
You have to focus on shifting gears.
There was a stop sign,
oh,
there's my driver.

153
00:10:22.170 --> 00:10:25.140
Teachers is talking to me.
Oh,
what a distraction.
Right?

154
00:10:25.141 --> 00:10:27.330
You're totally getting shivering.

155
00:10:27.810 --> 00:10:32.280
This is because you drove with a part of the brain called the prefrontal cortex.

156
00:10:32.281 --> 00:10:36.480
You had to use your prefrontal cortex for driving because he had to think of all

157
00:10:36.481 --> 00:10:40.140
the rules and that's something you had to do consciously,

158
00:10:40.530 --> 00:10:44.220
so you did have to pay a lot of attention to that process.

159
00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:48.270
Later on,
a couple of years later,
you drive with your Basal Ganglia.

160
00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:50.610
You can probably,
you know,

161
00:10:51.210 --> 00:10:55.230
get up in the morning half asleep and get yourself to work in your car.

162
00:10:55.231 --> 00:10:57.480
I'm not suggesting that's a good idea.

163
00:10:57.960 --> 00:11:00.930
I'm just saying you probably do a lot of things while you drive.

164
00:11:00.931 --> 00:11:04.860
People talk on the phone,
people talk to the person sitting next to them.

165
00:11:04.861 --> 00:11:09.660
People eat on the car,
people put on makeup in the car,
people text while driving.

166
00:11:09.661 --> 00:11:12.270
And you know,
that's leads to a lot of mistakes.

167
00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:17.460
But you can get from a to B without even noticing what you did because it's in

168
00:11:17.461 --> 00:11:18.570
your basal Ganglia.

169
00:11:18.930 --> 00:11:23.930
The brain is a lazy couch potato and likes to make things easy for it.

170
00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:28.380
Whatever you do with the prefrontal cortex takes up a lot of energy.

171
00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:33.510
There's something that psychologists call ego depletion or decision fatigue.

172
00:11:33.690 --> 00:11:38.250
After a long day of heavy thinking and paying attention to things,

173
00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:42.000
you're just done with it,
right?
You don't want to think anymore.

174
00:11:42.001 --> 00:11:46.230
You just want to watch Netflix or something like this.
You don't,
you don't.

175
00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:49.950
You have used up all your willpower at the end of a long day.

176
00:11:50.490 --> 00:11:53.950
So the prefrontal cortex is not an unlimited resource.

177
00:11:53.951 --> 00:11:58.540
It's an research that gets depleted easily,
that gets distracted easily,

178
00:11:58.541 --> 00:12:03.520
and that gets run over by the parts of the brain very easily.
Okay?

179
00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:07.510
So today I just wanted you to not just talk about the prefrontal Cortex,

180
00:12:07.511 --> 00:12:10.780
but to make you experience how easily it gets knocked up.

181
00:12:11.050 --> 00:12:15.400
So if you want to be successful in life and if you want to be successful at your

182
00:12:15.401 --> 00:12:16.780
jobs and high performing,

183
00:12:17.050 --> 00:12:22.050
you need to find ways to make the prefrontal cortex functioning properly.

184
00:12:23.020 --> 00:12:27.220
And there's three things we need in order to put,
you know,

185
00:12:27.310 --> 00:12:29.560
in order to make our prefrontal cortex happy.

186
00:12:29.890 --> 00:12:34.030
And these are the things I would like to show you today.
Are you ready for that?

187
00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:38.170
Okay.
So here it goes.

188
00:12:40.270 --> 00:12:42.160
If this performance,

189
00:12:45.650 --> 00:12:49.710
and I don't mean you know how much money you make or if other people think

190
00:12:49.711 --> 00:12:53.550
you're smart or you know,
things like that,

191
00:12:53.580 --> 00:12:58.580
I'm thinking about how high performing is your individual prefontal cortex at

192
00:12:59.731 --> 00:13:01.230
this given moment.
Okay?

193
00:13:01.231 --> 00:13:06.231
So this is measuring performance of your prefrontal cortex over here and here we

194
00:13:09.361 --> 00:13:11.100
have stress level,

195
00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:14.140
<v 0>okay?</v>

196
00:13:14.140 --> 00:13:18.400
<v 1>Basically here you would say you were in a coma,
sleep on over here,</v>

197
00:13:18.401 --> 00:13:20.110
you would be close to a panic attack.

198
00:13:20.111 --> 00:13:24.250
And in between there's many different circumstances and situations you could be

199
00:13:24.251 --> 00:13:25.084
in.

200
00:13:25.170 --> 00:13:29.920
So usually let's say somebody here calls you up and says,
you know,

201
00:13:29.921 --> 00:13:32.380
we have this new initiative at Google.

202
00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:38.500
We don't know yet if we're going to go through with it.
It's just a new idea.

203
00:13:38.501 --> 00:13:41.820
Maybe next year we're going to have a meeting about this.

204
00:13:41.821 --> 00:13:44.650
While we don't know yet to scoring to sponsor it.

205
00:13:44.890 --> 00:13:48.670
So could you please put together some PowerPoint presentation for this?

206
00:13:48.671 --> 00:13:53.140
And some ideas
doesn't sound very good,
does it?

207
00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:56.380
So you're just going to sit at your desk and you're probably going to clean up

208
00:13:56.381 --> 00:13:58.900
your desk and procrastinate and do other things,

209
00:13:58.901 --> 00:14:02.860
but your highest performance will not be on this job.

210
00:14:03.130 --> 00:14:08.130
This is true for all kinds of routine jobs such as doing your expenses or

211
00:14:08.501 --> 00:14:13.090
checking your emails.
You can do a lot of things just with your Basal Ganglia,

212
00:14:13.270 --> 00:14:15.380
right?
You,
we'll just go through the motions.

213
00:14:15.381 --> 00:14:19.990
No effort required and the performance of your prefrontal cortex will be very

214
00:14:19.991 --> 00:14:20.824
low.

215
00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:26.520
So now let's imagine that you're supposed to give a presentation in front of

216
00:14:27.461 --> 00:14:28.151
your CEO.

217
00:14:28.151 --> 00:14:31.810
I know you have your Christmas party tonight and you can now receive an email

218
00:14:31.811 --> 00:14:33.100
this very moment telling you,

219
00:14:33.430 --> 00:14:37.570
why don't you give a spontaneous speech tonight presenting,
you know,

220
00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:42.130
your latest results at work.
We'd love to hear more about this.

221
00:14:42.131 --> 00:14:44.680
It should be five to 10 minutes and you know,

222
00:14:44.681 --> 00:14:49.150
just prepare something really fun and energizing for people,
engage them,

223
00:14:49.450 --> 00:14:54.380
and afterwards we're going to write you and this will influence the bonus you

224
00:14:54.381 --> 00:14:58.580
get.
Okay?
Something like this there.

225
00:14:58.610 --> 00:15:03.530
Chances are that your performance is good to be down here because you might be

226
00:15:03.531 --> 00:15:08.510
so sweating and terrified.
Everybody's watching you all eyes on you,

227
00:15:08.511 --> 00:15:12.460
okay?
And then maybe right before your honor on it,

228
00:15:12.470 --> 00:15:17.330
you realize that all of your numbers are wrong or that you know something is not

229
00:15:17.331 --> 00:15:22.331
working out with your presentation when we are under an extreme stress,

230
00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:25.280
okay?
When we experiencing stress,

231
00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:29.630
our prefrontal cortex shuts down.
This is what happens.

232
00:15:29.870 --> 00:15:32.630
Your brain will go into fight,
flight,
or freeze,

233
00:15:32.810 --> 00:15:36.050
and this will lead to the fact that our brain just shuts down.

234
00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:37.820
Not all parts of the brain,

235
00:15:38.060 --> 00:15:41.370
but the prefontal cortex will shut down because every illusionary,

236
00:15:41.690 --> 00:15:43.490
from an evolutionary perspective,

237
00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:49.000
if you have to fight a bear in the forest,

238
00:15:50.780 --> 00:15:54.950
you wouldn't want to think of 10 different creative solutions of how to fight a

239
00:15:54.951 --> 00:15:55.131
bear.

240
00:15:55.131 --> 00:16:00.080
You can either fight or flight or freeze and hide under a Bush or something like

241
00:16:00.081 --> 00:16:04.250
that,
so under stress,
the prefrontal cortex shuts down.

242
00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:09.170
When my very bored,
our prefrontal cortex does not feel motivated to work,

243
00:16:09.171 --> 00:16:14.130
and then in both cases it's your basal Ganglia are doing the job when way bored.

244
00:16:14.210 --> 00:16:18.200
We just go and click it to our habits.
We do the things we always do.

245
00:16:18.201 --> 00:16:19.460
We go through the motions.

246
00:16:19.790 --> 00:16:23.660
Other people might even think you're performing well because if you have good

247
00:16:23.661 --> 00:16:28.160
habits,
then you can go through a lot in life just with your Basal Ganglia,
right?

248
00:16:28.420 --> 00:16:31.370
To all depends on what kind of training you had and what's in there.

249
00:16:33.140 --> 00:16:34.580
If you're very stressed,

250
00:16:34.730 --> 00:16:39.440
your brain will also rely on your basal Ganglia because your prefrontal cortex

251
00:16:39.441 --> 00:16:43.040
does not work properly anymore.
Then you also have to rely on instincts.

252
00:16:43.250 --> 00:16:43.921
That's why,

253
00:16:43.921 --> 00:16:48.921
and professor professions like fire fighting and the police and medical doctors

254
00:16:50.301 --> 00:16:53.510
who work in emergencies,
they train people a lot.

255
00:16:53.690 --> 00:16:58.690
Psychologists call this overtraining overlearning because they want to make sure

256
00:16:58.911 --> 00:17:03.620
that people have the right kind of actions.
Stuart and the Basal Ganglia.

257
00:17:03.770 --> 00:17:05.420
So in the military for example,

258
00:17:05.421 --> 00:17:10.421
you train how to pull the trigger 100 million times so that when the emergency

259
00:17:11.061 --> 00:17:14.420
situation comes up and your prefrontal cortex shuts down,

260
00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:18.380
you know exactly what to do and you make the decision within milliseconds

261
00:17:18.470 --> 00:17:20.690
because the prefrontal cortex is slow,

262
00:17:20.870 --> 00:17:25.610
but your basal Ganglia are quick and their work without you not even noticing,

263
00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:28.250
they just go on autopilot.
Okay,

264
00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:31.970
but this is where you want to be with your prefrontal Cortex,
right?

265
00:17:31.971 --> 00:17:35.150
If you want to be innovative,
if you want to come up with new ideas,

266
00:17:35.151 --> 00:17:38.300
if you want to create something new and exciting and your company,

267
00:17:38.750 --> 00:17:41.030
you have to engage your prefrontal cortex.

268
00:17:43.220 --> 00:17:44.240
As you can see,

269
00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:49.650
there's an inverse correlation between stress level and performance.

270
00:17:50.670 --> 00:17:54.990
If there's too little stress,
you will just do business as usual.

271
00:17:54.991 --> 00:17:58.830
People might even go into bore out.
People love what you do.

272
00:17:58.831 --> 00:18:00.720
You might get compliments for your work,

273
00:18:00.721 --> 00:18:04.970
but it's a bit boring and irrelevant and you just do it,
but it's,

274
00:18:05.730 --> 00:18:07.320
you know,
nobody cares about your work.

275
00:18:07.770 --> 00:18:11.040
And over here you might have a situation with too many deadlines,

276
00:18:11.041 --> 00:18:12.960
too many people wanting stuff from you,

277
00:18:13.230 --> 00:18:17.760
bad bosses who you know follow after you and give you bad feedback.

278
00:18:17.761 --> 00:18:21.630
All of the time.
Things like this can really wear down your prefrontal cortex.

279
00:18:22.050 --> 00:18:24.210
So how can you get up here?

280
00:18:27.820 --> 00:18:28.653
<v 0>Okay.</v>

281
00:18:29.380 --> 00:18:31.390
<v 1>When we reached peak performance,</v>

282
00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:36.360
we lose concept of time.

283
00:18:36.390 --> 00:18:40.860
If you ever had a moment at your work or in your free time when you really were

284
00:18:40.861 --> 00:18:44.520
performing at your best,
it could be in sports,
it could be music,

285
00:18:44.521 --> 00:18:47.190
it could be an arts,
it could even be at your job.

286
00:18:47.940 --> 00:18:49.770
You lose the concept of time.

287
00:18:49.890 --> 00:18:53.670
You're fully present here now and you love what you do.

288
00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:58.260
Usually this is associated with joyful.
It's a joyful experience.

289
00:18:58.440 --> 00:19:02.700
Research shows also that when we are in this state of mind,

290
00:19:02.850 --> 00:19:07.680
we are five times as productive five times as productive.
That's a lot.

291
00:19:07.681 --> 00:19:12.330
You could save a lot of time if you know how to get there whenever you want it,

292
00:19:12.570 --> 00:19:13.590
whenever you need it.

293
00:19:13.770 --> 00:19:18.510
Rather than spending most of your time here or here for your most strategic

294
00:19:18.511 --> 00:19:22.950
task,
for your most important decisions,
for the things that truly matter,

295
00:19:23.190 --> 00:19:27.270
you should know how to get here and there are three things you need,

296
00:19:29.490 --> 00:19:34.470
and I call them fun,
fear

297
00:19:36.660 --> 00:19:37.800
and focus.

298
00:19:41.310 --> 00:19:45.270
Why should you have fun at work?
Aren't you paid to work?

299
00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:49.050
You know it shouldn't that be what you receive for your hard work?

300
00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:52.280
Isn't that enough?

301
00:19:52.820 --> 00:19:57.820
Research shows that when people have fun at work and neurotransmitter called

302
00:19:58.250 --> 00:20:01.730
dopamine is released in your brain.
I will write it here.

303
00:20:01.731 --> 00:20:06.650
For those of you who want to remember that,
so you have the dopamine,
okay?

304
00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:10.370
And the Delta mean,
it's a real brain booster.

305
00:20:10.670 --> 00:20:15.110
Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that links into the reward system of your brain

306
00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:17.180
and will make you think faster.

307
00:20:17.181 --> 00:20:22.181
It will make you learn faster and it will make this a very joyful experience.

308
00:20:23.210 --> 00:20:24.230
If you think about it.

309
00:20:24.231 --> 00:20:29.231
It's not by coincidence that most famous people and who excel in some area

310
00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:32.420
really love what they do.

311
00:20:33.320 --> 00:20:37.250
Because when you're really good at something than dopamine is released and it

312
00:20:37.251 --> 00:20:40.070
makes it even better.
So if you want to have more fun at work,

313
00:20:40.071 --> 00:20:44.960
this is not just about having free food and all of the gadgets you enjoy here at

314
00:20:44.961 --> 00:20:48.760
Google of the after Work Party kind fun you're going to have tonight.

315
00:20:48.970 --> 00:20:52.150
It's more about do you truly love what you do,

316
00:20:52.540 --> 00:20:55.600
reo really good at what you're doing,
you know,

317
00:20:55.690 --> 00:21:00.010
fun related to the task that you perform every day.

318
00:21:00.850 --> 00:21:05.480
So my advice to you would be to find a job where you can be really the best in

319
00:21:05.481 --> 00:21:08.500
class,
not something where you're kind of doing okay,

320
00:21:08.501 --> 00:21:13.501
ish six something where your talents can shine and then you will get burst of

321
00:21:14.411 --> 00:21:17.560
dopamine that will help your brain to perform much better.

322
00:21:17.980 --> 00:21:21.310
Other ways to get more dopamine are to,
for example,

323
00:21:21.311 --> 00:21:25.780
work with surprise and novelty.
Every time we get surprised,

324
00:21:26.050 --> 00:21:29.830
our brain releases still Permian.
Every time something new happens,

325
00:21:29.831 --> 00:21:32.410
our brain reacts by eliciting dopamine.

326
00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:37.000
So that little exercise we did hear a few minutes ago,

327
00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:41.050
I also did this in order to get you out of a Rut,
you come to listen to a talk,

328
00:21:41.051 --> 00:21:44.800
but I wanted you to also do something you didn't expect to be doing because this

329
00:21:44.801 --> 00:21:48.790
will give everybody a burst of dopamine and it will make your retained better.

330
00:21:49.030 --> 00:21:53.770
What I tell you today,
jokes are a good way to get the dopamine burst.

331
00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:58.660
When people love the,
when people laugh,
the brain release a stove.
I mean,

332
00:21:58.930 --> 00:22:02.440
so if you want people to learn well and to perform well at work,

333
00:22:02.620 --> 00:22:05.950
it might pay off to have somebody really funny at the team.

334
00:22:06.730 --> 00:22:10.450
Maybe somebody's not really high performing person,
not so

335
00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:17.110
I'm serious,
funny people boost everybody's performance.

336
00:22:17.830 --> 00:22:18.880
So you know,

337
00:22:18.881 --> 00:22:23.290
if you have this fellow who's not adding much value but making jokes,

338
00:22:23.291 --> 00:22:24.820
keep that guy on the team

339
00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:31.000
from a brain perspective,
laughs really boosts performance.

340
00:22:32.530 --> 00:22:36.400
So that's the fun.
The second thing is the fear.

341
00:22:37.300 --> 00:22:39.310
I don't know if you have experienced that,

342
00:22:39.311 --> 00:22:43.960
but I have a friend and she went to a Bob Dylan concert and what happened is

343
00:22:43.961 --> 00:22:46.600
that she hated it.
Why did she hate it?

344
00:22:46.601 --> 00:22:49.300
Because he was playing new songs she never heard before.

345
00:22:49.450 --> 00:22:54.340
She wanted to hear the songs of she knew and love to sing along and instead he

346
00:22:54.341 --> 00:22:58.270
was going totally experimental on stage and she said,

347
00:22:59.230 --> 00:23:03.970
I didn't know the stuff he was singing.
It was okay.
Why did Bob Dylan do this?

348
00:23:03.971 --> 00:23:08.560
He was upsetting his audience.
Nobody loved the concert.

349
00:23:08.561 --> 00:23:13.390
People hated it.
Well,
otherwise I guess he would have been bored to death.

350
00:23:13.720 --> 00:23:17.170
If you're Bob Dylan and you've been doing the same thing for 40 years,

351
00:23:17.350 --> 00:23:21.070
you don't want to play the same songs.
It goes out of your ears.

352
00:23:21.071 --> 00:23:24.060
Your ears will explode if you hear that song one more time.
I Dunno,

353
00:23:24.100 --> 00:23:28.450
I'm not Bob Dylan,
but I guess that's what's good.
What was going on in his mind.

354
00:23:28.451 --> 00:23:33.280
You need to try new things.
You need to push the boundaries.
Most people,

355
00:23:33.310 --> 00:23:36.520
when you ask them how can you reach best performance,

356
00:23:36.521 --> 00:23:40.690
they say this happens when the challenge meets your skillset.

357
00:23:41.410 --> 00:23:46.410
No,
that's not true.
This happens when the challenge exceeds your skill set.

358
00:23:46.580 --> 00:23:50.880
You need to be slightly over challenged.
Okay?

359
00:23:50.940 --> 00:23:55.050
Find a job you really love and then push yourself to the boundaries.

360
00:23:55.140 --> 00:23:58.590
Get over the tub,
do things that are a bit too difficult for you.

361
00:23:59.190 --> 00:24:03.100
Do things that are a bit scary.
If you're never scared at your job,

362
00:24:03.101 --> 00:24:06.930
something's wrong with you.
You need to be sometimes a bit nervous.

363
00:24:06.970 --> 00:24:09.960
You need to try new things.
You need to experiment.

364
00:24:10.140 --> 00:24:12.210
If you're always staying in your comfort zone,

365
00:24:12.750 --> 00:24:15.660
your brain would react by going into your basal Ganglia.

366
00:24:15.840 --> 00:24:18.570
Because when we have a slight level of fear,

367
00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:24.000
Oh our brain releases a substance called noradrenaline and noradrenaline is a

368
00:24:24.871 --> 00:24:29.430
positive stress hormones.
Okay?

369
00:24:29.850 --> 00:24:34.800
Nor good.
Nolan might not be the prettiest flip chart you guys have seen.

370
00:24:34.801 --> 00:24:36.360
But um,

371
00:24:37.080 --> 00:24:39.960
so here it is for those of you who want to write it down.

372
00:24:40.170 --> 00:24:42.000
So you need the Dopa mean,

373
00:24:42.001 --> 00:24:44.910
but you also need the Noradrenalin when there's no challenge,

374
00:24:44.911 --> 00:24:48.120
when there's no deadline.
When nobody cares about what you're doing,

375
00:24:48.750 --> 00:24:52.320
you will underperform.
You will go into Basal Ganglia mode.

376
00:24:52.500 --> 00:24:56.040
So push yourself.
If you find yourself too comfortable in your role,

377
00:24:56.041 --> 00:25:01.041
you might want to quit your job or go on a job rotation or try something new.

378
00:25:01.890 --> 00:25:03.300
If you're getting too comfortable,

379
00:25:03.390 --> 00:25:06.930
you will go into bore out and your brain will think,

380
00:25:07.080 --> 00:25:09.960
why should I engage my prefrontal cortex?

381
00:25:10.140 --> 00:25:14.670
It costs me a lot of energy and attention to engage my prefrontal cortex.

382
00:25:14.820 --> 00:25:19.170
The brain will only do it when it's really necessary and if there is no

383
00:25:19.171 --> 00:25:21.360
challenge,
if there's snow fear,

384
00:25:21.750 --> 00:25:24.270
your brain will not go through all of this effort.

385
00:25:24.390 --> 00:25:28.560
So you need to be slightly over challenged to achieve that.

386
00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:30.193
<v 0>Okay?</v>

387
00:25:30.660 --> 00:25:34.830
<v 1>Yes.
A question and he got dinged.
A fear and distress.
Well,</v>

388
00:25:34.831 --> 00:25:38.450
I'm not an expert in this issue at all,
but um,

389
00:25:39.110 --> 00:25:41.640
that's uh,
Auriemma um,
is it,

390
00:25:41.641 --> 00:25:45.240
is it good one when we are a bit nervous or with fear,

391
00:25:45.630 --> 00:25:48.540
but easy to associated also with cortisol,

392
00:25:48.750 --> 00:25:52.620
like it happens at the same time an easy because I've earned that cortisol is

393
00:25:52.621 --> 00:25:54.750
not that good for your performance.

394
00:25:54.751 --> 00:25:59.640
So then I would like to know your opinion about that.
Yeah,

395
00:26:00.010 --> 00:26:03.640
cortisol is also helpful,
but it's not a good thing.

396
00:26:03.670 --> 00:26:05.860
Cortisol is a negative stress hormone.

397
00:26:06.100 --> 00:26:10.210
So what happens with cortisol is that if you have that over a longer period of

398
00:26:10.211 --> 00:26:11.410
time and your body,

399
00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:16.300
your will go into burnout or part of your brain called the Amygdala,

400
00:26:16.301 --> 00:26:19.150
which is processing negative information will grow.

401
00:26:19.390 --> 00:26:21.580
Your prefrontal cortex will shrink.

402
00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:24.580
Your hippocampus for learning will shrink as well.

403
00:26:24.730 --> 00:26:28.990
So Cortisol has a very damaging impact on our brain,

404
00:26:29.140 --> 00:26:33.840
but when it's cortisol released,
cortisol is released.
When,
um,

405
00:26:34.540 --> 00:26:38.230
there's chronic stress over a longer period of time.

406
00:26:38.231 --> 00:26:41.830
So let's say you have an awful boss who treats you badly.

407
00:26:42.070 --> 00:26:44.730
If you live in a relationship,

408
00:26:44.940 --> 00:26:48.540
if you go to your job every morning and you feel that you hate it,

409
00:26:49.050 --> 00:26:51.080
that will give you a level of cortisol.

410
00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:53.690
When you feel so overstressed that you can sleep anymore,

411
00:26:53.700 --> 00:26:56.760
it's the cortisol hindering you to,
to go to sleep,

412
00:26:56.970 --> 00:27:01.560
nor adrenaline gives you positive push.
Okay?
So it gives you a kick.

413
00:27:01.740 --> 00:27:05.100
Cortisol will slow things down for you.

414
00:27:05.280 --> 00:27:08.520
So this is the matter of whether it's a short term stress.

415
00:27:08.700 --> 00:27:11.670
Here I'm speaking about short term stress,
which is good,

416
00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:14.780
or whether it's a long term stress.
And then the mom,

417
00:27:14.820 --> 00:27:19.820
number one protection factor for cortisol is actually autonomy.

418
00:27:20.520 --> 00:27:24.360
If you think about it,
big bosses in large organizations,

419
00:27:24.361 --> 00:27:25.830
they work many hours,

420
00:27:26.100 --> 00:27:29.790
but they're not as stressed as the people at the bottom who may be work nine to

421
00:27:29.791 --> 00:27:32.910
five because when we can influence the situation,

422
00:27:33.690 --> 00:27:36.630
that's when our brain makes sense of the situation.

423
00:27:36.631 --> 00:27:41.631
It does matter whether you work up to 3:00 AM because your boss told you to do

424
00:27:41.671 --> 00:27:46.020
that or whether you work up to 3:00 AM because it's your company and you chose

425
00:27:46.021 --> 00:27:49.080
to do that.
If you feel that it's this a purpose associated with it.

426
00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:51.150
So if you want to avoid cortisol,

427
00:27:51.330 --> 00:27:55.650
try to take as much control of the situation as you can rather than being a

428
00:27:55.651 --> 00:28:00.570
victim,
go into more active role to to fight the situation.
Okay,

429
00:28:01.530 --> 00:28:06.240
so that's the noradrenaline and the fear part.
What about focus?

430
00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:10.080
Imagine some,
you know,

431
00:28:10.560 --> 00:28:15.560
some athlete in the middle of a match like Johnny Saxton or imagined Serena

432
00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:21.180
Williams playing a tennis match,
and then in the middle of the match,

433
00:28:21.390 --> 00:28:24.810
she's pulling out her cell phone.
She says,
I just need to take the call,

434
00:28:24.811 --> 00:28:29.100
hold on a moment or need to check my emails.
People would hate that.

435
00:28:29.190 --> 00:28:33.480
Their fence would be appalled.
People would be shocked.
But in the business world,

436
00:28:33.481 --> 00:28:36.690
that's how people behave all the time.
Constantly.

437
00:28:36.870 --> 00:28:41.610
People are multitasking.
People are constantly checking their emails.

438
00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:45.240
People are hardly ever focused,
right?

439
00:28:45.540 --> 00:28:49.200
And research shows that when we multitask,

440
00:28:49.201 --> 00:28:54.201
we make 50% more mistakes and we take 50% longer to complete the task.

441
00:28:56.010 --> 00:29:00.240
Research also shows that today's teenagers have the attention span shorter than

442
00:29:00.241 --> 00:29:04.380
the one of an average goldfish.
Attention span is going down.

443
00:29:04.381 --> 00:29:07.530
Our brains are plastic.
We're adapting to new situations,

444
00:29:07.531 --> 00:29:10.860
and if you're constantly multitasking,
you're not getting better at it.

445
00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:13.770
Your attention span is actually going down because your brain says,

446
00:29:13.771 --> 00:29:17.730
I never need focused prolonged attention.
Right?
I never needed it.

447
00:29:17.731 --> 00:29:19.590
So why should I develop that skill?

448
00:29:20.010 --> 00:29:24.120
But it's impossible to reach peak performance.
If you're not fully focused,

449
00:29:24.570 --> 00:29:28.920
because when you're fully focused and present in the moment,

450
00:29:29.220 --> 00:29:32.700
your brain will release a substance called Acetylcholine.

451
00:29:33.540 --> 00:29:35.420
Let me write it down here for you.

452
00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:45.670
As we saw in the little exercise we did in the group this morning,

453
00:29:46.570 --> 00:29:51.100
you're really had to focus on keeping the seven out of the game,
right?

454
00:29:51.101 --> 00:29:53.650
You really had to focus on these complex calculations.

455
00:29:53.800 --> 00:29:57.040
Your prefrontal cortex will only work when you're fully focused.

456
00:29:57.041 --> 00:29:58.510
It requires attention.

457
00:29:58.690 --> 00:30:02.470
It's impossible to get into flow if you're not focused.

458
00:30:02.650 --> 00:30:06.760
So what should you do about it?
I mean,
there's many ways to go.
One of them is,

459
00:30:06.761 --> 00:30:07.241
for example,

460
00:30:07.241 --> 00:30:11.590
to eliminate distractions from the onset because our prefrontal cortex is a

461
00:30:11.591 --> 00:30:12.940
limited resource.

462
00:30:13.180 --> 00:30:17.860
If you are going to spend all of your energy suppressing the urge to check your

463
00:30:17.861 --> 00:30:18.221
phone,

464
00:30:18.221 --> 00:30:22.720
let's say it's on your desk while you work on something and then you just read a

465
00:30:22.721 --> 00:30:26.080
book that told you that multitasking is bad and then you decided to check it

466
00:30:26.081 --> 00:30:29.080
less,
you always got to look at it and think,
no,
okay,
I check it later.

467
00:30:29.470 --> 00:30:31.850
Get rid of it.
Okay,
put it somewhere else.
I,

468
00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:37.030
I know that many executives are no doing what is called a meeting of one.

469
00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:41.290
When we get in a meeting with other people,
we always schedule time.

470
00:30:41.291 --> 00:30:46.210
We turn off the phone,
we don't check.
You know,
we really focus on that meeting,

471
00:30:46.630 --> 00:30:49.510
but you should be just as

472
00:30:51.280 --> 00:30:56.110
critical,
rigorous when you have a meeting with yourself.

473
00:30:56.111 --> 00:30:58.990
If you really have to put an important presentation together,

474
00:30:58.991 --> 00:31:02.980
if you're really have to solve an important question,
take some time.

475
00:31:02.981 --> 00:31:06.490
Block your door.
Don't let people walk in on you.
You know,

476
00:31:06.491 --> 00:31:09.460
I don't know if you have an open office policy or something like this.

477
00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:12.910
Put something in front of your door so that nobody can get in.

478
00:31:12.911 --> 00:31:14.170
It's nice to be social,

479
00:31:14.380 --> 00:31:18.040
but research shows that when people have too much open office spaces,

480
00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:22.720
collaboration,
communication actually decreases.
You think it would go up,

481
00:31:22.721 --> 00:31:27.220
but it actually goes down because people are hiding because it's impossible to

482
00:31:27.221 --> 00:31:29.970
focus if you constantly have your colleagues in your,

483
00:31:30.100 --> 00:31:33.100
so find a way to truly focus on your work.
But I,

484
00:31:33.550 --> 00:31:36.040
I would like to let you in on a little secret.

485
00:31:37.210 --> 00:31:40.460
Most books will tell you that,
you know,

486
00:31:40.480 --> 00:31:43.780
eliminating distraction is the right way to improve focus.

487
00:31:43.781 --> 00:31:48.310
Or that you should go to a mindfulness training course and learn meditation and

488
00:31:48.311 --> 00:31:52.840
do yoga,
something to train up your inherent ability to focus.

489
00:31:53.620 --> 00:31:54.460
That's good,

490
00:31:54.730 --> 00:31:59.020
but it's not really working because people know that multitasking is bad and

491
00:31:59.021 --> 00:32:02.410
they keep doing it anyhow.
Why do they keep doing it anyhow?

492
00:32:02.590 --> 00:32:06.190
Because we're addicted to our phones.
If you think about it,

493
00:32:06.250 --> 00:32:10.750
every time you get a new email or something happens or social media,

494
00:32:10.930 --> 00:32:14.050
your brain thinks,
oh,
there could be something new and relevant going on.

495
00:32:14.050 --> 00:32:15.160
I need to check that out.

496
00:32:15.161 --> 00:32:18.790
And then you get a burst of dopamine and you get a burst of noradrenaline

497
00:32:18.791 --> 00:32:20.950
because there could be something relevant for you.

498
00:32:21.400 --> 00:32:26.400
And when we are bored at work and the less tired and a bit,

499
00:32:27.220 --> 00:32:28.840
you know,
not fully motivated,

500
00:32:29.290 --> 00:32:33.940
you might just as well pick up your phone to see if something new is going on in

501
00:32:33.941 --> 00:32:38.941
order to get a quick burst of dopamine or when you're very stressed and you want

502
00:32:41.511 --> 00:32:45.140
to escape from that situation,
your phone could be an escape strategy from the,

503
00:32:45.141 --> 00:32:47.430
rather than focusing on what's going on around you,

504
00:32:47.431 --> 00:32:51.650
you focus on your phone and what happens is that every time and your email comes

505
00:32:51.651 --> 00:32:53.180
up or something new happens,

506
00:32:53.330 --> 00:32:57.110
you get these bursts of dopamine and they link into the reward circuits in your

507
00:32:57.111 --> 00:33:00.800
brain and you get addicted to it and you need more and more and more.

508
00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:04.550
As you can see in teenagers,
Druck use has gone down,

509
00:33:04.700 --> 00:33:06.350
but phone use has gone up,

510
00:33:06.470 --> 00:33:09.770
so it's a new drug basically in the fray in the brain,

511
00:33:10.310 --> 00:33:15.310
I'm multitasking and the use of mobile devices is treated like an addiction.

512
00:33:16.100 --> 00:33:18.950
If you look at people's brain while they're looking at the phone,

513
00:33:19.100 --> 00:33:22.070
it's like a brain in love or Brighton on drugs.

514
00:33:22.700 --> 00:33:27.700
So I want to invite you to create a work environment that is more fun and where

515
00:33:30.681 --> 00:33:34.790
you have the right level of fear and then focus will come naturally.

516
00:33:35.660 --> 00:33:36.860
Pay attention to that.

517
00:33:37.100 --> 00:33:40.400
You will see that these things are correlated to each other.

518
00:33:40.640 --> 00:33:44.210
When you have fun at work and when there's truly something at stake,

519
00:33:44.211 --> 00:33:49.080
when it's challenging,
your focus will be the I immediately yes,
they,

520
00:33:49.190 --> 00:33:52.940
they uh,
had a session with executives.
They were walking on glass.

521
00:33:53.270 --> 00:33:55.130
We first wanted to do a fire walk,

522
00:33:55.131 --> 00:33:57.740
but then the university building wouldn't allow that.

523
00:33:57.890 --> 00:34:01.350
So then we did a glass walk on real it,
you know,

524
00:34:01.520 --> 00:34:04.100
it was 70 bottles of glass shattered,

525
00:34:04.160 --> 00:34:08.240
70 bottles of wine shattered on the floor and people were walking over it

526
00:34:08.241 --> 00:34:12.680
barefoot.
Nobody was multitasking while doing that.

527
00:34:12.770 --> 00:34:16.430
Everybody was focused.
Trust me,
I've seen people,

528
00:34:16.431 --> 00:34:21.350
everybody was really paying attention while walking because you don't want to

529
00:34:21.351 --> 00:34:23.630
hurt yourself.
So you have a certain level of fear.

530
00:34:23.810 --> 00:34:27.110
And it was kind of fun because it was new and unexpected,

531
00:34:27.170 --> 00:34:31.400
not something you do every day.
Right?
Let's walk on glass today.

532
00:34:31.520 --> 00:34:35.900
So people had fun,
people had fear,
and everybody was focused.

533
00:34:36.590 --> 00:34:39.530
We didn't even have to tell people to focus.
Focus just happened.

534
00:34:39.680 --> 00:34:44.180
So if you find yourself having trouble with focus,
improve the level of fun,

535
00:34:44.330 --> 00:34:48.770
improve the level of fear and it will come naturally.
Thank you.

536
00:34:49.280 --> 00:34:54.280
<v 2>[inaudible] you have</v>

537
00:34:58.260 --> 00:34:59.093
<v 4>Christians,</v>

538
00:34:59.370 --> 00:35:03.450
so you're kind of talking a lot about like delaying or postponing gratification.

539
00:35:03.900 --> 00:35:04.733
Um,

540
00:35:04.740 --> 00:35:09.740
what are some of the more specific things that people could do to try and be

541
00:35:09.841 --> 00:35:14.730
better at that?
To delay gratification.

542
00:35:14.760 --> 00:35:17.400
Yeah.
Cause that seems,
what's your kind of thesis is there?
Yeah.
Yeah.

543
00:35:17.900 --> 00:35:21.020
<v 1>Well find something you truly love and practice it.</v>

544
00:35:21.440 --> 00:35:25.760
Research shows that people like musicians who have to practice a lot to get

545
00:35:25.761 --> 00:35:26.390
better,

546
00:35:26.390 --> 00:35:31.100
they have a better executive control because let's say if you spend all of your

547
00:35:31.101 --> 00:35:35.120
day playing video games,
you get an instant reward all of the time.
You know,

548
00:35:35.121 --> 00:35:38.700
you just pushed some button and then it's Whoa,
you know,
something happened.

549
00:35:39.120 --> 00:35:43.800
<v 4>I kind of disagree with that,
honestly.
Yes.
Like in many computer games,</v>

550
00:35:43.801 --> 00:35:46.200
you don't just mindlessly mash on buttons.

551
00:35:46.201 --> 00:35:48.900
You actually have to think about your skillset,
develop yourself.

552
00:35:48.901 --> 00:35:50.820
You have to train,
you have to look at other people's,

553
00:35:50.821 --> 00:35:54.270
how they strategized a lot of things and actually a lot of research recently has

554
00:35:54.271 --> 00:35:56.370
been showing that like computer games happening,

555
00:35:57.480 --> 00:36:01.890
increasing one's ability to focus and train oneself and getting in many states

556
00:36:01.891 --> 00:36:02.820
of flow,
which is

557
00:36:02.910 --> 00:36:06.570
<v 1>what'd y'all talk about in the game,
but not necessarily outside the game,</v>

558
00:36:07.110 --> 00:36:08.430
<v 4>but you can apply it elsewhere.</v>

559
00:36:08.680 --> 00:36:09.340
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

560
00:36:09.340 --> 00:36:14.320
but I think you get more instant reward and the video game that if you do

561
00:36:14.350 --> 00:36:15.520
practicing the cello,

562
00:36:15.880 --> 00:36:16.740
<v 4>definitely.
Yeah,
that I agree.</v>

563
00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:20.630
<v 1>Right.
I agree with you that in the moment when you play the video game,</v>

564
00:36:20.631 --> 00:36:22.760
you are in flow.
You have the fun,
you have the fear,

565
00:36:22.761 --> 00:36:24.050
you have the folk was for sure,

566
00:36:24.350 --> 00:36:28.520
but if you do things that give you no gratification in the beginning,

567
00:36:28.521 --> 00:36:33.521
such as learning to play an instrument or reading long books with more than a

568
00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:36.230
hundred pages,
right,

569
00:36:36.500 --> 00:36:41.450
then what happens is that your brain will get used to not get everything right

570
00:36:41.451 --> 00:36:44.000
away,
but a lot of it has to do with parenting.

571
00:36:44.001 --> 00:36:46.670
If your parents brought you up to work for things,

572
00:36:46.940 --> 00:36:49.670
then you probably will continue to do that later in life as well.

573
00:36:49.671 --> 00:36:53.990
So when you have kids you should be thinking about not spoiling them too much or

574
00:36:53.991 --> 00:36:57.230
they will not have that ability to delay gratification.

575
00:36:57.470 --> 00:37:02.470
And then you have what we see today that many millennials are having suicidal

576
00:37:03.141 --> 00:37:06.920
thoughts and are very unhappy because they always got everything from their

577
00:37:06.921 --> 00:37:09.860
parents than ever had to work to get anything.
Okay,

578
00:37:10.670 --> 00:37:14.510
<v 5>so you're talking about um,
the correlation between performance and stress.</v>

579
00:37:14.511 --> 00:37:19.010
So if you were to look at it in a perspective of time as well,
because for me,

580
00:37:19.011 --> 00:37:24.011
the dopamine and noradrenaline and all of the fun fear and focus teams to be a

581
00:37:25.191 --> 00:37:29.530
little bit more short term side true or how like how long can you keep going?

582
00:37:29.550 --> 00:37:30.383
Like that

583
00:37:30.510 --> 00:37:31.380
<v 1>short term thing,</v>

584
00:37:31.620 --> 00:37:36.200
you cannot be all day and flow and you shouldn't be all day and slow.
Because if,

585
00:37:36.201 --> 00:37:40.800
think about it when your brain releases dopamine and noradrenaline
Acetylcholine,

586
00:37:40.980 --> 00:37:44.910
it gives your brain a quick burst but then it vanished it quickly.

587
00:37:45.210 --> 00:37:48.840
If you think about negative stress hormones such as cortisol,

588
00:37:49.020 --> 00:37:51.240
the hit to your body and they can stay forever.

589
00:37:51.720 --> 00:37:56.250
Let's say you know I give you a positive and give you 10 things to think about

590
00:37:56.251 --> 00:37:56.331
it.

591
00:37:56.331 --> 00:38:00.390
Say you did great on this and this and this and this and this and this and great

592
00:38:00.480 --> 00:38:03.570
job at this and great and great hooray.

593
00:38:03.660 --> 00:38:06.060
And they'll say you have one little area for improvement,

594
00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:09.120
one little thing to work on.
That's the one you're going to remember.

595
00:38:09.240 --> 00:38:13.590
We are wired to focus on negative things.
Okay,

596
00:38:13.710 --> 00:38:16.950
so what this means is that this is a short term thing.

597
00:38:17.070 --> 00:38:22.070
You should use that if you want to get something really important done and then

598
00:38:22.681 --> 00:38:26.550
it's okay to spend the rest of the day.
Sometimes under challenged,

599
00:38:26.551 --> 00:38:27.780
sometimes over challenged.

600
00:38:28.020 --> 00:38:31.230
This is something you should use for your most important moments.

601
00:38:31.400 --> 00:38:32.790
If you think about athletes,

602
00:38:32.940 --> 00:38:36.840
they spent a week training and recovering and then they're just have a one hour

603
00:38:36.860 --> 00:38:40.840
match.
You need that for that one hour match and afterwards your brain will be

604
00:38:40.841 --> 00:38:44.560
depleted.
What do you see is that when your brain will is still pumping?

605
00:38:45.640 --> 00:38:50.440
When all of that dopamine is used up,
you feel kind of like exhausted.

606
00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:51.850
So it's a short term thing.

607
00:38:53.120 --> 00:38:56.870
<v 4>So,
uh,
most of us don't truly have their offices here.</v>

608
00:38:57.180 --> 00:39:02.150
It's a plan.
And basically if you want to disconnect,

609
00:39:02.151 --> 00:39:05.590
what about for instance,
listening to the music and,

610
00:39:06.060 --> 00:39:08.710
and specific music more like Costco.

611
00:39:11.090 --> 00:39:13.430
I didn't get to your questions,
so you would wish to this.

612
00:39:13.431 --> 00:39:17.750
If you want to be skull neck guitar does listening to the music,
uh,

613
00:39:17.780 --> 00:39:19.230
help that orange stripe.

614
00:39:19.450 --> 00:39:22.840
<v 1>So if you want to focus whether it's good to listen to music,</v>

615
00:39:23.110 --> 00:39:26.430
well for some people it's good and for others there's,

616
00:39:26.470 --> 00:39:29.800
it's not research shows that this is highly individual.

617
00:39:30.010 --> 00:39:32.860
It seems that a little bit of background noise.

618
00:39:33.040 --> 00:39:38.020
It's good if you want to be creative here.
I've been here,

619
00:39:38.170 --> 00:39:43.170
we've been speaking about the flow state and then music can be good if it's not

620
00:39:43.600 --> 00:39:46.030
disrupting you,
if it helps you to get,

621
00:39:46.031 --> 00:39:49.630
if it's quieter than the more quiet than the people around you.

622
00:39:50.590 --> 00:39:51.820
But if you,
for example,

623
00:39:51.821 --> 00:39:56.800
want to be a bit creative and if you're designing things and if you're working

624
00:39:56.801 --> 00:39:59.590
in a more artistic way of working,

625
00:39:59.860 --> 00:40:03.520
it could be okay to have an office that is like Starbucks,
you know,

626
00:40:03.521 --> 00:40:07.390
with lots of people running around because then these distractions will give

627
00:40:07.391 --> 00:40:11.590
your brain some impact to pack,
to make connections that you haven't made before.

628
00:40:11.770 --> 00:40:15.630
So the answer is for some people it's good and for some jobs it's good with you

629
00:40:15.640 --> 00:40:17.860
really have to just concentrate and focus.

630
00:40:18.850 --> 00:40:22.360
And if you're working more artistically it's actually okay to be a bit more

631
00:40:22.361 --> 00:40:23.194
distracted.

632
00:40:23.570 --> 00:40:26.030
<v 4>Thank you so much for the,
for the talk.
Have a question.</v>

633
00:40:26.031 --> 00:40:30.500
When do you provide these talks or the courses like the walking on glass?

634
00:40:30.830 --> 00:40:31.520
Um,

635
00:40:31.520 --> 00:40:35.300
they're probably tailored to the group but they'd probably run from your own BSG

636
00:40:35.301 --> 00:40:36.650
as well because you do it so often.

637
00:40:36.950 --> 00:40:39.350
What do you do to create the final few and focus for yourself?

638
00:40:40.470 --> 00:40:43.650
<v 1>That's a really good question.
Actually.
The little experiment here,</v>

639
00:40:43.651 --> 00:40:48.360
we did with the,
with the standing up.
I've only done this once before.

640
00:40:48.361 --> 00:40:52.350
I always create new stuff for myself and usually,
you know,

641
00:40:52.351 --> 00:40:53.430
I've just changed it now.

642
00:40:53.431 --> 00:40:56.400
I made it about the prefrontal cortex and the Basal Ganglia.

643
00:40:56.580 --> 00:40:59.820
I always taken other brain parts.
You know,

644
00:41:00.030 --> 00:41:04.620
I changed my presentations,
I adapt them.
I try to also,

645
00:41:04.860 --> 00:41:06.720
for me,
well,

646
00:41:06.960 --> 00:41:11.960
the fun for me is the purpose because I see that people get the benefit for what

647
00:41:12.661 --> 00:41:14.280
I'm doing.
So if people tell me,

648
00:41:14.281 --> 00:41:17.280
or this was really helpful and write to me a year later,

649
00:41:17.281 --> 00:41:21.420
then this for me adds value to my life,
to what I'm doing.

650
00:41:21.720 --> 00:41:25.140
The fear is,
you know,
I mean public failure,
you know,

651
00:41:25.141 --> 00:41:29.010
I could be here on stage making a mess and you know,

652
00:41:29.400 --> 00:41:33.920
somebody asks very smart questions and I could be standing here,
you know,

653
00:41:33.921 --> 00:41:36.800
like in full idiot,
this can happen,
right?

654
00:41:36.860 --> 00:41:39.920
And then your reputation is kind of ruined.
This will be filmed.

655
00:41:40.130 --> 00:41:43.070
So there's always a level of fear and focus.

656
00:41:43.540 --> 00:41:44.373
<v 2>MMM.</v>

657
00:41:45.060 --> 00:41:46.770
<v 1>Once I have the fun and the fear comes,</v>

658
00:41:46.771 --> 00:41:50.310
but a mix things up and what as it happens for me,

659
00:41:50.311 --> 00:41:55.080
my engagements get bigger.
I get more speeches with more people there.

660
00:41:55.081 --> 00:41:58.620
More than thousands,
you know,
when they started out with small groups.

661
00:41:58.621 --> 00:42:03.621
And now I get this sometimes big things where I have to design something new.

662
00:42:05.210 --> 00:42:06.043
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

663
00:42:07.090 --> 00:42:09.130
<v 6>Thank you very much.
Thank you for all your questions.</v>

664
00:42:09.131 --> 00:42:11.350
Thank you for Federica for this great talk.

665
00:42:11.351 --> 00:42:14.890
And I think there is no doubt that we need to train our bodies,

666
00:42:14.891 --> 00:42:19.120
but our brain is well,
and now we'll have an instruction.
Uh,
thank you so much.

667
00:42:20.130 --> 00:42:20.660
<v 2>Thank you.</v>

668
00:42:20.660 --> 00:42:25.660
[inaudible].
