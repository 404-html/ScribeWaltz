1
00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.790
Today,
I'm really delighted to introduce Oliver who,
Betty,
Dr. James Pressure,

2
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.240
who've written this,
uh,
this magnificent book,
very beautiful and informative.

3
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:19.010
Um,
I'll have her as a designer and journalist.

4
00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.760
He was previously senior year design editor at National Geographic and Dr

5
00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:28.790
Cheshire is at a university college London where he's a senior lecturer and

6
00:00:29.461 --> 00:00:33.890
quantitative human geography and has a great interest in,
uh,

7
00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:38.950
and using big data and visualization and the social sciences.
So,
uh,

8
00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.150
please welcome.
Good

9
00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.540
<v 0>[inaudible]</v>

10
00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:49.840
<v 2>hello.
And also hello to the wider Google audience.</v>

11
00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:54.700
Um,
it's,
it brings me great pleasure to be here,
um,
in,

12
00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:56.380
in a number of ways.
Um,

13
00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:01.030
especially being here in Boston because my brother Justin Uberti actually worked

14
00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:04.420
here for a least a year.
I believe.

15
00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:07.750
He worked at the Kirklin office and then came to Boston and is now back in

16
00:01:07.751 --> 00:01:10.780
Kirkland and may be watching a,
so what's up bro?

17
00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:14.950
We're going to talk about a number of things today.

18
00:01:14.951 --> 00:01:16.900
We're going to be talking about data visualization.
Um,

19
00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:20.890
we're also going to be talking about the partnership that James and I have as an

20
00:01:20.891 --> 00:01:24.850
academic and as a graphic designer working on equal footing,
um,

21
00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:29.910
to bring hard science to the public in these immersive data visualizations.

22
00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:35.560
And we're going to reveal how we do that.
A bit of our process,
um,
you know,

23
00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:37.450
on the backend processing data,

24
00:01:37.451 --> 00:01:42.451
but then also all the labeling and front end work that goes to making these uh,

25
00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.730
data sets,
um,
more accessible to the public.

26
00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:47.860
Then you might find in the back of US scientific journal.

27
00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:52.120
But first I want to talk a little bit about how we came to know each other and

28
00:01:52.121 --> 00:01:55.360
that starts off with my work at national geographic.
Uh,

29
00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:57.790
as a senior design editor.
Um,

30
00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:02.890
I kind of came of age as data and big data was coming of age in the early two

31
00:02:02.891 --> 00:02:06.280
thousands and found my cell,
even though it was in the design department,

32
00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:08.500
eaves dropping a lot in the graphics department.

33
00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:12.970
I was really interested in this idea of how we take data and Statistics and

34
00:02:12.971 --> 00:02:16.330
start to visualize them.
And coming from a fine arts background.

35
00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:18.730
I like to work with my hands a lot.

36
00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:23.820
And we had this Dataset from a story out of the EPA and the study through Baylor

37
00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.470
University where they were finding pharmaceuticals,

38
00:02:26.471 --> 00:02:30.260
evidence of pharmaceuticals showing up in fish tissue,
uh,

39
00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:33.760
in sites all around the country.
And to communicate this,

40
00:02:33.761 --> 00:02:37.570
I thought we got to make a fish out of pills and not computer generated pills,

41
00:02:37.571 --> 00:02:40.690
not sugar pills,
the actual medications that were found in this study.

42
00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:45.850
So we fed up,
set up a photo studio,
a in a pharmacy after hours.

43
00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:47.260
And,
uh,

44
00:02:47.261 --> 00:02:51.590
I created this large mouth bass out of Prozac and anti Histamines,
uh,

45
00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:55.400
the green and the yellow pills are the prozacs and you know,

46
00:02:55.401 --> 00:02:57.100
that it was really,

47
00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:01.510
I had no way of knowing what really pills the pharmacy was going to have in

48
00:03:01.511 --> 00:03:01.901
stock.

49
00:03:01.901 --> 00:03:06.370
So I showed up with this spreadsheet of permutations of how to keep the ratios

50
00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:11.170
imbalanced depending on how many bills were available.
Um,

51
00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:13.350
and then,
uh,

52
00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:18.350
I got word of a set of research coming out of London and James Phd Project was

53
00:03:20.561 --> 00:03:24.380
actually looking at surnames.
And the most popular surname's,
uh,
oh,

54
00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:27.490
a huge database of surnames in the UK.

55
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.660
And I was wondering if he could help me create a map of the most popular

56
00:03:31.661 --> 00:03:35.110
surnames in the United States and going back and forth over of course,

57
00:03:35.111 --> 00:03:37.610
a month course of months.
Uh,

58
00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:42.630
we produced this map which reveals the 25 most popular surnames in each state

59
00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:49.300
that are sized by frequency and colored by,
uh,

60
00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:51.610
country of origin,
approximately.

61
00:03:51.611 --> 00:03:56.290
So you get pockets of Scandinavian and German ancestry in the Midwest,
uh,

62
00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:01.000
Spanish surnames and rising up in the southern states,
uh,

63
00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:05.470
pockets of French down in Louisiana.
And then of course up here in Massachusetts,

64
00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:10.500
there's some Irish ancestry poking into the top 25 and to talk a little bit more

65
00:04:11.801 --> 00:04:16.480
about this research and what led us onto our next collaboration,
bring James up

66
00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:18.820
everyone.

67
00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:22.170
<v 1>Thanks for having us.
Um,
so essentially,
uh,</v>

68
00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:27.240
Oliver was the first designer I'd ever met or even spoken to,

69
00:04:27.311 --> 00:04:31.870
I think at this point.
Um,
uh,
traditionally,
um,
you know,

70
00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:36.370
as in the academic sphere don't often stick our heads out of our research

71
00:04:36.371 --> 00:04:38.680
offices to speak to a broader audience.

72
00:04:38.681 --> 00:04:42.070
And I really enjoyed working on this particular project where we were taking

73
00:04:42.071 --> 00:04:45.670
kind of a large database of names and,
and,

74
00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:49.180
and making them kind of easily accessible and Reuban this way.

75
00:04:49.181 --> 00:04:52.240
And for someone it was just a phd student at the time.

76
00:04:52.241 --> 00:04:55.270
Getting something in the National Geographic magazine was kind of a big,

77
00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:00.920
big deal.
Alongside this,
I was,
um,
working on,
uh,

78
00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:04.900
lots of maps and graphics about London.
So this was,
I'm not quite sure,

79
00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:08.080
maybe a decade ago now,
um,

80
00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:12.970
maybe slightly less than London was really entering a transition from being

81
00:05:12.971 --> 00:05:17.800
quite a data poor city to a very data rich one.
So there's a lot of initiatives,

82
00:05:17.801 --> 00:05:20.110
particularly in the UK but also,
um,

83
00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:24.520
over here in the states about opening up data and making data freely available

84
00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.600
to the public and for others to,
to use and make use of.

85
00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:33.850
And so this was a bubbling away in the background on a research or a blog that I

86
00:05:33.851 --> 00:05:38.110
was participating.
Uh,
uh,
I was contributing to making new forms of maps,

87
00:05:38.111 --> 00:05:40.970
that kind of thing.
And it gained a lot of interest.
And,
um,

88
00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:44.650
a couple of publishers approach me,
uh,
to,
to turn it into a book.

89
00:05:44.651 --> 00:05:46.930
And it occurred to me that,
you know,

90
00:05:46.931 --> 00:05:49.940
I'm good at making a s maps,
um,

91
00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:53.320
that kind of are okay online and they look all right and research papers.

92
00:05:53.321 --> 00:05:56.410
But I really needed a designer to,
to,
to,

93
00:05:56.411 --> 00:06:00.920
to take these and put them on the printed page and the options where you could

94
00:06:00.921 --> 00:06:05.120
submit a draft manuscript to a publisher and use their in house designer or you

95
00:06:05.121 --> 00:06:07.760
could work collaboratively with one as a coauthor throughout.

96
00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:11.600
And that's why I approached Shawn liver as a recommendation or someone to

97
00:06:11.601 --> 00:06:13.940
recommend really in the UK.
Um,

98
00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:18.110
but he'd just gone freelance at that point and said that,
um,
you know,

99
00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:21.600
I think he thought it was a lot further along with the project.
And then,
uh,
uh,

100
00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:26.370
I actually was,
but he agreed to,
to work with me.
So this was that,
that was like,

101
00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:29.870
this is our first book called London,
the information capital.
And we,
we,
uh,

102
00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:34.760
did a whole series of data visualizations on that.
This one is looking at,

103
00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:39.570
um,
24 hours of flights over UK,

104
00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:43.460
um,
air space.
And,
um,

105
00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:48.650
uh,
just before we came out of the book,
we a Strava data,

106
00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:52.410
the quantified self movement or that kind of stuff had just started.
So,
um,

107
00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:55.670
we've got access to,
uh,
uh,

108
00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:57.800
a bulk download from Strava.

109
00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:02.790
It was still kind of a startup or a small startup at that point.
Um,

110
00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:07.930
and we're able to map the flows of cyclists a into London across the rush hour

111
00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:13.010
period.
And so I think,
you know,

112
00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:16.130
if we look back and we think about what the biggest kind of contribution of that

113
00:07:16.131 --> 00:07:18.190
book was and is,

114
00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:22.910
it was this for the first time we were taking data that were being collected on

115
00:07:22.911 --> 00:07:26.730
apps or that were already collected and that stopped behind,
uh,
uh,

116
00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:29.990
firewalls and things like that.
We were taking it out and we were,

117
00:07:29.991 --> 00:07:31.730
we were taking it to a wider audience.

118
00:07:31.731 --> 00:07:34.700
And this was the first time people had seen this stuff,
um,

119
00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:39.260
uh,
about undone or even any city.

120
00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:44.700
Um,
and so that kind of got us thinking about some of the work that,
you know,

121
00:07:44.810 --> 00:07:48.860
we can do together as a collaboration and how we can make a contribution.

122
00:07:48.861 --> 00:07:50.870
And we've decided that,
you know,

123
00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:54.110
the things we're really interested in is kind of taking a moment in time when

124
00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:57.830
data is suddenly becoming available in unprecedented volumes,

125
00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:03.560
capturing it in,
in data visualizations and then publishing it as books.

126
00:08:04.190 --> 00:08:08.180
And it's not just about data visualization for its own sake.
You know,

127
00:08:08.181 --> 00:08:11.360
we've all seen things online where there's um,
you know,

128
00:08:11.361 --> 00:08:13.700
they kind of look called initially and then you look back at them or for a

129
00:08:13.701 --> 00:08:15.500
second again eating actually,
what is that telling me?

130
00:08:15.501 --> 00:08:17.870
That's not telling me anything or I don't really understand that.
You know,

131
00:08:17.871 --> 00:08:22.100
network diagrams are a classic case,
you know,
social networks,
things like that.

132
00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:23.413
Um,

133
00:08:23.630 --> 00:08:27.860
so we're very much in the business of taking good design principles,

134
00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:32.780
good cartographic principles and transforming them into compelling and

135
00:08:32.781 --> 00:08:36.320
interesting data visualizations that can look quite traditional in many ways.

136
00:08:36.321 --> 00:08:40.880
And you'll see that in some of the slides were showing.
So the,

137
00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:42.740
the London book was a great success.

138
00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:46.580
The publish obviously wanted us to do a second one and they were thinking about

139
00:08:46.581 --> 00:08:50.390
Uk,
maybe another city,
something like that.
But Oliver,
um,

140
00:08:50.450 --> 00:08:53.930
through his work at National Geographic was keen that we move spheres and

141
00:08:53.931 --> 00:08:57.960
actually move into the animal because he'd noticed that they were at this kind

142
00:08:57.961 --> 00:09:02.961
of technological moment when millions or billions of data points are now being

143
00:09:03.151 --> 00:09:06.900
collected on,
on small sensors.
And for those,

144
00:09:06.901 --> 00:09:10.800
if any of you worked with spatial data coordinates,
that kind of thing,
you know,

145
00:09:10.801 --> 00:09:13.980
the great advantages,
the formats,
everything's exactly the same.

146
00:09:13.981 --> 00:09:18.981
Whether it's a commuting cyclist in London in this map or some commuting

147
00:09:19.801 --> 00:09:21.840
baboons,
uh,
in this map.

148
00:09:22.770 --> 00:09:27.770
And this is a study where they had a gps loggers,

149
00:09:28.230 --> 00:09:28.491
uh,

150
00:09:28.491 --> 00:09:33.420
on a troop of baboons or most of a troop of baboons and they were sampling them

151
00:09:33.421 --> 00:09:38.400
every second.
So they had their location every second over a three week period.

152
00:09:38.750 --> 00:09:42.900
Um,
so that's a lot of data points.
And um,

153
00:09:44.010 --> 00:09:48.690
you know,
the Nice thing about it was you get these kind of a daily movement.

154
00:09:48.691 --> 00:09:52.270
So you can see this is where they start sleeping.
And then,
uh,
you know,

155
00:09:52.290 --> 00:09:55.530
this is where they go out foraging and then they looped back to their sleeping

156
00:09:55.531 --> 00:09:59.940
site.
That gives a nice kind of overall impression of their behavior.

157
00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:04.000
But what the researchers were really interested in is,
uh,

158
00:10:04.060 --> 00:10:07.320
have a boons make decisions on where they decided to go.

159
00:10:07.321 --> 00:10:08.700
And so thanks to their data,

160
00:10:08.701 --> 00:10:11.430
thanks to the fact they had data at second by second resolution.

161
00:10:11.730 --> 00:10:13.930
You can zoom into particular moment.

162
00:10:14.060 --> 00:10:19.060
And the moment we chose was the baboons running across this area of crop land

163
00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:24.390
here.
They didn't like it.
They got harassed by local herders and farmers.

164
00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:29.190
So it was kind of a big thing for the,
for the baboons and they to run across.

165
00:10:29.191 --> 00:10:31.810
They didn't want to hang around.
And um,

166
00:10:32.250 --> 00:10:36.840
we could then see that exact moment.
We could see,
um,
uh,

167
00:10:36.990 --> 00:10:40.680
the,
uh,
some baboons run off one way,
some,
some run another way.

168
00:10:40.890 --> 00:10:43.320
And the fact that also that the,
the,
the,
the,

169
00:10:43.470 --> 00:10:47.140
the kind of go signal that the one that they all started running on was it was

170
00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:51.750
led by juvenile and their mother,
not by an Alpha male or female.
And,

171
00:10:51.810 --> 00:10:56.100
um,
you can see how,
uh,
you know,
uh,
different moments in time,

172
00:10:56.520 --> 00:10:57.353
uh,
the,

173
00:10:57.410 --> 00:11:01.110
the Boone's either decided to compromise where they want to go or they choose to

174
00:11:01.111 --> 00:11:01.950
follow one or the other,

175
00:11:01.951 --> 00:11:06.300
but it's a fairly democratic decision making process that the researchers had a

176
00:11:06.301 --> 00:11:10.630
hunch about.
But,
um,
we're only really able to prove,
uh,

177
00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:12.160
through,
um,

178
00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:17.200
large crowd kind of data mining exercise to create these rules about when one

179
00:11:18.031 --> 00:11:22.440
baboon goes one way,
how,
how do the others follow?
And this,

180
00:11:22.441 --> 00:11:23.970
this study really represents,

181
00:11:23.971 --> 00:11:28.110
I think that that transition from a researcher having to spend weeks in the

182
00:11:28.111 --> 00:11:32.580
field in a,
in a,
in a,
uh,
hide or a truck just monitoring,

183
00:11:33.090 --> 00:11:37.980
uh,
visually the behaviors of these animals to essentially be able to remotely

184
00:11:38.070 --> 00:11:42.870
follow them and things like that.
And it's a transition that,
um,

185
00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:45.060
I think it's probably been most profound in,

186
00:11:45.061 --> 00:11:49.970
in looking at marine data in particular.
So this is,
um,

187
00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:54.070
up until about,
I don't know,
maybe 20 years ago or even less,

188
00:11:54.071 --> 00:11:55.210
was probably 20 years ago,

189
00:11:55.211 --> 00:11:58.780
it's probably one the most comprehensive data sets on the distribution of whales

190
00:11:59.140 --> 00:12:00.010
that existed.

191
00:12:00.850 --> 00:12:05.560
And it's actually creative from a 19th century whaling logs.

192
00:12:05.890 --> 00:12:09.670
So,
um,
in this case it was a,

193
00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:13.160
because whales are a resource,
you know,
the city of Boston in particular was,
uh,

194
00:12:13.210 --> 00:12:18.070
uh,
all the areas around here were particularly dependent on wailing.
You know,

195
00:12:18.071 --> 00:12:20.020
you want us to know where the whales,
where and how you,

196
00:12:20.021 --> 00:12:24.820
how many you've caught because it was a century in auditing exercise and,

197
00:12:24.850 --> 00:12:29.840
um,
a guy called towns and went through and,
uh,

198
00:12:30.370 --> 00:12:34.350
manually mapped each of the locations of the approximate locations of where

199
00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:37.430
whales were killed by species.
And,
um,

200
00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:42.450
you get this distribution map where you get different species of whale,
um,
uh,

201
00:12:42.490 --> 00:12:44.410
different times of years appearing.

202
00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:50.760
And this liked a number of examples in the kind of animal kingdom is an example

203
00:12:51.881 --> 00:12:56.860
of where you're mapping where the animals have died essentially.
Um,
it's uh,

204
00:12:57.220 --> 00:12:59.800
not when they're living,
but when they've been killed.
Um,

205
00:12:59.890 --> 00:13:02.860
you're managing a resource,
you're not managing a kind of environment,

206
00:13:02.861 --> 00:13:06.880
you're not managing an ecosystem.
And

207
00:13:08.770 --> 00:13:13.770
that kind of lead researchers in the 60s on was to start developing their own

208
00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:17.850
mini sensors to monitor animal movement and behaviors.

209
00:13:17.851 --> 00:13:21.750
So this is one of the first,
uh,
bio logging,
uh,

210
00:13:21.940 --> 00:13:26.770
devices that was created.
It was a developed by a guy called Rory Wilson,

211
00:13:26.771 --> 00:13:30.240
who's at the University of a Swanzi.
And uh,

212
00:13:30.250 --> 00:13:35.250
you can see here it's kind of a syringe that he's pushed a spring in.

213
00:13:36.070 --> 00:13:39.610
This is a piece of cork.
And on that piece of cork,
he,

214
00:13:39.690 --> 00:13:44.470
he had a bit of magnesium that was,
was,
uh,
burning,

215
00:13:45.210 --> 00:13:50.020
uh,
when it came into contact with water and they strapped it to the front of

216
00:13:50.230 --> 00:13:55.210
Penguins.
And when the penguin was swimming,
depending on the speed it was going,

217
00:13:55.211 --> 00:14:00.211
it would push that cork in a kind of up that syringe and the magnesium wood

218
00:14:00.401 --> 00:14:03.220
burner align on it.
And you'd see,
uh,

219
00:14:03.710 --> 00:14:07.450
how fast the at the animal swimming.
No one had done this before.
And you know,

220
00:14:07.451 --> 00:14:11.530
even with this kind of somewhat clumsy device on the front of them,
you know,

221
00:14:11.531 --> 00:14:16.030
he discovered that the birds were swimming faster and further than than we

222
00:14:16.031 --> 00:14:19.720
thought.
Jump forward to the present day.

223
00:14:20.170 --> 00:14:23.080
This is what Rory is.
Lab now looks like.

224
00:14:23.081 --> 00:14:27.410
It's kind of a mission control for the animal data.
Here we have,
um,

225
00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:32.640
a couple of minutes of data from a circling vulture that they've attached a

226
00:14:32.830 --> 00:14:36.710
attack too.
So you can see there's all kinds of different,
uh,

227
00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.600
sensors that are crammed into the small device.
Now.
Accelerometers,

228
00:14:41.530 --> 00:14:43.690
magnetometers,
gps.

229
00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:49.030
And so this is kind of like a feed of information they have about the bird

230
00:14:49.031 --> 00:14:51.010
spiraling,
a behavior,

231
00:14:51.020 --> 00:14:53.330
looking at turbulence over the wings and that kind of thing.

232
00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:57.950
So we really wanted to,
to kind of get to grasp,
uh,
uh,

233
00:14:57.980 --> 00:15:01.040
get to grips with the data and see if we can visualize it in an interesting way.

234
00:15:01.041 --> 00:15:05.690
How do you take back,
which isn't necessarily a,
um,
you know,

235
00:15:06.230 --> 00:15:11.090
uh,
user friendly version of,
of,
of a data feed.
How do you,

236
00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:14.690
how do you make that into something that looks a bit like this where you've

237
00:15:14.691 --> 00:15:19.691
actually just extracted a small sample of that data are really interesting part

238
00:15:19.761 --> 00:15:24.750
of it just for a few seconds of a voucher flight and you've,
uh,

239
00:15:24.830 --> 00:15:27.690
looked at the air temperature outside,
which is one of the things that,

240
00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:31.790
that we're mapping here.
Um,
and you can really see how,
uh,

241
00:15:31.820 --> 00:15:36.820
the sensors detecting these very tiny kind of fluctuations Petia patients and in

242
00:15:37.310 --> 00:15:42.080
a bird behavior and they can start looking and understanding of that to see how

243
00:15:42.081 --> 00:15:45.530
things are,
how the animal behaves and how it accounts for different things.

244
00:15:46.940 --> 00:15:49.550
So that's the journey.
That's the journey we're on here.

245
00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:55.280
And there's some really remarkable technology.
So we've got Rorys,
uh,

246
00:15:55.970 --> 00:16:00.650
uh,
really high resolution,
magnetometers,
accelerometers and things like that,

247
00:16:00.651 --> 00:16:05.210
but he's trying to put on birds.
And then we've also got tags that,
um,
you know,

248
00:16:05.211 --> 00:16:09.320
this is probably the largest tag that we've,
uh,
we kind of feature in the book.

249
00:16:09.321 --> 00:16:13.130
It's about the size of a computer mouse.
Um,
that thing is,

250
00:16:13.190 --> 00:16:18.190
is capable of collecting something like 62 gigabytes of data and a 12 hour time

251
00:16:19.131 --> 00:16:22.910
period,
um,
about one way or so.
Um,

252
00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:27.470
in here there's a couple of little attachments where they stick suction cups,

253
00:16:27.471 --> 00:16:30.800
you know,
same thing.
You did attach a sat nav to a car window with,

254
00:16:31.250 --> 00:16:35.960
they creep up behind the whale with this thing on a long pole and then they kind

255
00:16:35.961 --> 00:16:40.961
of just flipped the pole down and it hits the back of the whale and uh,

256
00:16:41.930 --> 00:16:42.830
sticks on.

257
00:16:43.220 --> 00:16:46.910
And then after about 12 hours it would drop off and float to the surface with

258
00:16:46.911 --> 00:16:51.620
all this data.
And that,
that these are kind of passive sensors.

259
00:16:51.621 --> 00:16:52.760
They have active ones too,

260
00:16:52.761 --> 00:16:57.040
but they're passive in the sense that they are using the whales sonar to,
uh,

261
00:16:57.140 --> 00:16:58.970
detect what the way it is doing.

262
00:16:58.971 --> 00:17:02.760
So when whales of toothed whales in particular hump,

263
00:17:02.830 --> 00:17:07.280
they emit some sonar that bounces back from uh,

264
00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:12.270
their environment and just as the whale is detecting the bounce back,
uh,

265
00:17:12.290 --> 00:17:15.260
centers,
uh,
able to take that as well.

266
00:17:16.250 --> 00:17:21.110
And we have the exact moment.
This is over a five second period,
um,
when,

267
00:17:21.180 --> 00:17:25.250
uh,
uh,
a tooth,
well,
it is hunting at a very small fish.

268
00:17:25.251 --> 00:17:30.170
So this is a fish that's maybe this big and just from the,
so nice,

269
00:17:30.171 --> 00:17:31.400
a bit tricky to see here,

270
00:17:31.401 --> 00:17:35.840
but you can see that there's these signatures here and this is stuff bouncing.

271
00:17:35.870 --> 00:17:39.560
This is the reflection coming back from the particular fish that he's,

272
00:17:39.710 --> 00:17:42.500
that he's after.
So,
uh,
each,
um,

273
00:17:43.730 --> 00:17:48.580
the winter of each of these boxes,
columns here is the,
uh,

274
00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:51.390
time between,
uh,
buses.

275
00:17:51.391 --> 00:17:54.730
So the whale starts off clicking.
So it will let,

276
00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:58.950
let off a click and wait some milliseconds before the next one comes back.

277
00:17:59.010 --> 00:18:00.720
A few milliseconds for the next one comes back.

278
00:18:01.170 --> 00:18:05.130
And it kind of a coarse resolution.
It realizes there's a fish here,

279
00:18:05.131 --> 00:18:06.450
this is something I'm interested in.

280
00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:11.130
And then it zooms in a bit on the fish and then uh,

281
00:18:11.490 --> 00:18:14.280
for a couple of seconds,
it then does this buzz,

282
00:18:14.281 --> 00:18:17.430
which is a really high resolution noise.

283
00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:22.460
And then this is the signature and we get every moment that the fish is getting

284
00:18:22.861 --> 00:18:25.380
closer and closer.
The whales heads here.

285
00:18:25.381 --> 00:18:29.690
So this is kind of distance so you can see the fish is getting closer to the

286
00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:32.970
whale.
And then,
um,
this is a point,

287
00:18:32.971 --> 00:18:37.971
see this is where the fish realizes that it's possibly lunch and it coils up and

288
00:18:38.391 --> 00:18:41.070
we kind of springs off to try and swim away.

289
00:18:41.071 --> 00:18:45.770
So you get this kind of slightly more scattered,
uh,
impression from the sonar.

290
00:18:45.771 --> 00:18:49.440
I here and then you get it to swimming off in this direction and then it

291
00:18:49.441 --> 00:18:51.460
completely disappears.
Um,

292
00:18:51.750 --> 00:18:56.040
cause the good news for the fish is the fish essentially just did that.
Uh,

293
00:18:56.070 --> 00:18:58.950
and as soon as the fish moves to one side,

294
00:18:58.951 --> 00:19:02.850
the whale can't see it anymore cause that,
so in our beam is pretty,

295
00:19:02.851 --> 00:19:03.990
it's pretty narrow field of view.

296
00:19:03.991 --> 00:19:07.620
So the worst thing you can do if you're being chased by a wireless to try and

297
00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:12.540
out swim it,
um,
you just need to move to one side,
um,
and,

298
00:19:12.670 --> 00:19:15.780
and it loses you.
So

299
00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:20.550
we kind of have information about the,
how the,

300
00:19:20.551 --> 00:19:24.960
the whales are feeding about their particular ecology,

301
00:19:25.170 --> 00:19:27.700
but we're also using animals to,
um,

302
00:19:28.470 --> 00:19:30.360
do some ocean sensing for ourselves.

303
00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:33.780
So these are kind of like sent animals sentinels if you like.

304
00:19:34.110 --> 00:19:36.060
And this is one of our favorite examples really,
that,

305
00:19:36.061 --> 00:19:38.880
that shows some of the kind of processes that were going through.

306
00:19:38.881 --> 00:19:42.800
So this is a sensor.
It's actually quite large,
um,
rebut,

307
00:19:42.850 --> 00:19:44.310
but they get a little bit bigger than this.

308
00:19:44.940 --> 00:19:47.760
It's about this size actually looking at stuff to the head of a seal.

309
00:19:49.050 --> 00:19:53.340
And it detects information about ocean temperature,
salinity,
that kind of thing,

310
00:19:54.060 --> 00:19:55.020
not for ecologist,

311
00:19:55.021 --> 00:19:58.860
but for oceanographers who want to know what's going on in the world's oceans.

312
00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:04.430
And there's hundreds of these seals swimming round and talk to occur.

313
00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:09.570
And this is kind of the raw feed of data that comes back or at least some

314
00:20:10.290 --> 00:20:13.200
indication of their location.
And this to me was,

315
00:20:13.201 --> 00:20:16.890
it was kind of the first graphic raw graphic I produced and it really captured

316
00:20:16.891 --> 00:20:18.240
everything we were trying to show for the book.

317
00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:20.940
It's one of these graphics that you think,
wow,
that's a big hairball of data.

318
00:20:20.941 --> 00:20:25.480
That's really interesting.
What surprised me really was um,

319
00:20:26.250 --> 00:20:29.240
all of those kind of initial take on it.
So um,

320
00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:32.160
here we have the big hairball and I thought this would be the main kind of

321
00:20:32.161 --> 00:20:36.900
feature story about these particular sensitive particular animals I've sent.

322
00:20:36.930 --> 00:20:39.150
I sent that previous image to,
to Oliver.

323
00:20:39.540 --> 00:20:43.650
He then puts it in a kind of initial draft layout.
This is the first indicator,

324
00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:45.840
you know,
lay out that we came out with and you'll see that,

325
00:20:45.841 --> 00:20:50.470
that his instinct is to remove all the color and all that kind of clutter and

326
00:20:50.471 --> 00:20:53.740
just focus on one individual track one individual story.

327
00:20:53.741 --> 00:20:57.220
That's what we want to show within this big hairball.

328
00:20:57.550 --> 00:20:59.500
And it's a bit like this in nature documentaries,

329
00:20:59.501 --> 00:21:00.790
if you ever watch a nature documentary,

330
00:21:00.791 --> 00:21:03.160
they're not looking at a whole colony of Gannets,
you know,

331
00:21:03.161 --> 00:21:06.370
those zoom in on one particular breeding pair or something like that.

332
00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:08.620
It's because people can understand that and relate to it.

333
00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:11.800
And this is essentially what we're trying to do here.

334
00:21:12.580 --> 00:21:16.060
So this is a fictitious track that's just been drawn on,

335
00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:19.290
but we start looking through the hairball to find one that we've,

336
00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:24.360
we've particularly thought was representative and we settled on Rudolf who,

337
00:21:25.630 --> 00:21:26.550
uh,
is a,

338
00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:31.310
an elephant seal that was tagged for a year or more actually,

339
00:21:31.330 --> 00:21:33.900
I think a couple of years.
Uh,

340
00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:39.120
and we actually track him a swimming along the Antarctic peninsula hauling out

341
00:21:39.611 --> 00:21:44.611
here on some cis and then swimming back across towards the Falkland Islands.

342
00:21:45.020 --> 00:21:49.750
And around there,
one story that we then started thinking,
well,

343
00:21:51.130 --> 00:21:54.610
this is really interesting,
but it's a bit of a blank canvas still.

344
00:21:54.611 --> 00:21:58.660
We've got the journey,
but what's he encountering?
What kind of terrain is there?

345
00:21:59.050 --> 00:22:03.550
Um,
what's,
what's going on in the water beneath him?

346
00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:08.480
So we spent a lot of time working on um,

347
00:22:08.890 --> 00:22:12.850
terrain mapping techniques and we'll talk briefly about this in a second.
Uh,

348
00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:16.840
that really captures,
you know,
the ocean floor as it as,
as it is.

349
00:22:16.841 --> 00:22:20.210
So you can see the deep trenches is swimming over.
Um,

350
00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:26.040
the cit is encountering and really getting to grips with that single narrative.

351
00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:28.870
You'll see that we have the hairball still here,

352
00:22:28.871 --> 00:22:32.350
but it's actually been shrunk down to quite a small part of the double page

353
00:22:32.351 --> 00:22:35.860
spread.
Um,
cause we want it to,
to focus in on that individual.

354
00:22:36.700 --> 00:22:39.700
And what's more,
we actually gave Rudolph two spreads in the book,

355
00:22:40.630 --> 00:22:43.540
which is quite privileged.
Not many animals get,
uh,
uh,

356
00:22:43.690 --> 00:22:47.440
two double page spreads because actually we were interested too in the data that

357
00:22:47.441 --> 00:22:52.180
he was able to collect about ocean temperature.
So that particular transect,
uh,

358
00:22:52.300 --> 00:22:57.220
is uh,
strung across the page here.
The black line is the depths that,

359
00:22:57.250 --> 00:23:01.150
uh,
he's diving too.
Now,
I thought this was a glitch on the sensor,

360
00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:04.960
but this line here is a thousand meters down.

361
00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:08.770
So at that point you break some thousand meters underwater.

362
00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:11.860
And I thought that was a mistake,
but actually seals are capable of,

363
00:23:12.190 --> 00:23:15.340
they regularly dive to those kinds of depths.
Um,

364
00:23:16.150 --> 00:23:20.050
and that's why they're great ocean monitors because as they're diving down,

365
00:23:20.051 --> 00:23:23.290
they're collecting all these measurements and you get a temperature gradient

366
00:23:23.291 --> 00:23:27.970
here of,
of,
of data.
You can kind of see how,

367
00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:31.810
uh,
you know,
we've gone from that kind of initial,
um,

368
00:23:32.500 --> 00:23:35.650
hairball,
which looked a bit like this as well with the contextual data.

369
00:23:35.860 --> 00:23:40.100
These are kind of individual,
uh,
uh,
animal types,
uh,
to,

370
00:23:40.150 --> 00:23:44.130
to a much kind of cleaner impression of what's going on.
Um,

371
00:23:44.290 --> 00:23:47.630
so really a lot of what we do is kind of a data reduction exercise.
You know,

372
00:23:47.631 --> 00:23:48.650
we talked about big data,

373
00:23:48.651 --> 00:23:52.190
but we're actually in the business of reducing as much of the data as we can to

374
00:23:52.191 --> 00:23:54.170
get kind of insight or intelligence.
I guess

375
00:23:56.570 --> 00:23:59.240
for,
for another part of this story,

376
00:23:59.241 --> 00:24:01.400
it was really important to get that contextual information.

377
00:24:01.401 --> 00:24:05.510
So I mentioned the sea floor that we were interested in for Rudolph,

378
00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:09.380
but if your,
um,
a burden you're flying,

379
00:24:10.010 --> 00:24:11.540
actually that doesn't make much difference.

380
00:24:11.541 --> 00:24:14.330
What you're interested in is the kind of medium that you're passing through.

381
00:24:14.331 --> 00:24:17.510
And that's,
that's air.
Uh,
that's the winds you're encountering.

382
00:24:17.511 --> 00:24:22.330
So I'm sure many of you have seen,
um,
this really excellent,
uh,

383
00:24:22.340 --> 00:24:26.140
whether visualization,
um,
uh,

384
00:24:26.210 --> 00:24:30.230
called Earth Dot nullschool.
Um,
you know,
it's one of the first visualization,

385
00:24:30.260 --> 00:24:30.671
kind of as a,

386
00:24:30.671 --> 00:24:34.610
as a cartographer that really made the cartographic community kind of sit up and

387
00:24:34.611 --> 00:24:38.270
think actually computer scientists kind of know what they're doing sometimes

388
00:24:38.271 --> 00:24:41.300
when it comes to data visualization and you know,

389
00:24:41.301 --> 00:24:43.730
they're capable of creating these kinds of graphics.

390
00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:47.300
So it kind of inspired by that.
Um,
uh,

391
00:24:47.301 --> 00:24:51.670
I thought we really need to show wind global wind patterns for a story we've got

392
00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:56.260
about albatrosses.
So,
um,
here is,
uh,

393
00:24:56.360 --> 00:25:00.590
something I generated.
Um,
um,
this is,
uh,
does anyone use our,

394
00:25:00.591 --> 00:25:03.290
here are steps.
I did this in our,

395
00:25:03.410 --> 00:25:08.190
probably one of my proudest visualizations I've ever done in,
in our,
um,

396
00:25:09.170 --> 00:25:14.170
which captured the wind conditions are approximately during the period that we

397
00:25:14.211 --> 00:25:17.780
were interested in is modeled data.
It's not actual,
uh,

398
00:25:18.380 --> 00:25:21.220
they have a few readings,
but of course they have to interpolate it.

399
00:25:21.260 --> 00:25:22.880
But you can basically the Antarctica,

400
00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:25.250
this is Antarctica and all the winds rushing off.

401
00:25:25.910 --> 00:25:30.910
And the reason this was so important was it brought to life this story about

402
00:25:30.981 --> 00:25:35.510
these migrating these wandering albatrosses that go all the way around a

403
00:25:35.511 --> 00:25:39.890
Antarctica.
And in particular there's this point of no return,

404
00:25:41.010 --> 00:25:45.170
which these curricula and island here and essentially because of the way that

405
00:25:45.171 --> 00:25:48.200
the winds are kind of whipping round the continent,

406
00:25:48.710 --> 00:25:53.710
it's easier for a bird to fly all the way round than to try and turn back,

407
00:25:55.130 --> 00:25:59.530
uh,
to the,
to,
to the breeding colony.
So you can see here this,

408
00:25:59.531 --> 00:26:04.531
this guy kind of made it and then turn back was this one carried on all the way

409
00:26:05.541 --> 00:26:07.730
around because they needed the tailwinds to help them.

410
00:26:08.120 --> 00:26:13.120
And the researchers hadn't actually mapped the wind on to their data or their

411
00:26:13.431 --> 00:26:17.490
data onto the wind.
So,
um,
this was something that,
you know,

412
00:26:17.530 --> 00:26:20.650
we're quite pleased with because it really brought to life some of the,
the,

413
00:26:20.850 --> 00:26:24.710
the importance of the country,
the context that the animals are moving through.

414
00:26:24.711 --> 00:26:25.820
And that's often overlooked,

415
00:26:26.210 --> 00:26:29.330
particularly by the researchers who are more concerned about the,
you know,

416
00:26:29.331 --> 00:26:30.890
the specifics of their data.

417
00:26:32.900 --> 00:26:37.570
And then just the final example of context,
um,
that,

418
00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:41.040
that we can now do.
And,
um,
it is,
you know,

419
00:26:41.060 --> 00:26:44.910
thanks to satellite imagery and,
and remotely remotely sense technology.

420
00:26:45.180 --> 00:26:50.180
You can actually map the data onto the conditions that the animal was really

421
00:26:50.311 --> 00:26:51.390
experiencing at that time.

422
00:26:51.391 --> 00:26:56.391
So this is a story about snowy owls in the Great Lakes and how they,

423
00:26:56.520 --> 00:27:00.660
um,
uh,
spend time,
uh,
over the winter.

424
00:27:01.560 --> 00:27:05.780
And how thanks to tracking technology,
the researchers,
um,

425
00:27:06.120 --> 00:27:08.080
notice that the,
the,

426
00:27:08.140 --> 00:27:13.050
the birds were spending a lot of time or on lakes on the Great Lakes and

427
00:27:13.051 --> 00:27:16.320
actually discovered that they were floating on ice,
um,
and,

428
00:27:16.340 --> 00:27:19.800
and hunting a wild fowl.
And you know,

429
00:27:19.950 --> 00:27:24.060
if we'd used our kind of standard satellite imagery basement for this,
you know,

430
00:27:24.061 --> 00:27:26.760
that was probably taken in the summer or something like that.

431
00:27:27.060 --> 00:27:28.470
All these blue circles,

432
00:27:28.471 --> 00:27:32.130
which are kind of moments when the bird of particular hours spent spent time

433
00:27:32.131 --> 00:27:36.880
drifting on ice would have been in,
in,
in water.
They wouldn't have been on ice.

434
00:27:36.881 --> 00:27:41.260
So thanks to the NASA motor symmetry,
we're,

435
00:27:41.261 --> 00:27:46.200
we were able to get,
again,
approximate date.
This was over a month long period.

436
00:27:46.201 --> 00:27:47.040
We had this data.

437
00:27:47.041 --> 00:27:52.041
So we selected one day in that month and we were able to kind of line up the

438
00:27:53.041 --> 00:27:57.180
bird information with the actual ice information,
which,

439
00:27:57.610 --> 00:28:01.950
um,
you know,
we,
we often people kind of overlook that.

440
00:28:01.951 --> 00:28:04.320
But from a kind of a,
for a very detailed perspective,

441
00:28:04.321 --> 00:28:06.060
that's quite important for us to be able to do that.

442
00:28:06.061 --> 00:28:11.061
And it's really demonstrative of a transition from kind of like a data poor

443
00:28:11.370 --> 00:28:15.570
environment,
a very data rich one that the satellites have been able to give us.

444
00:28:16.280 --> 00:28:17.290
Um,
so I had no,

445
00:28:17.291 --> 00:28:20.850
to all of announced to a bit more about some of our design process

446
00:28:25.080 --> 00:28:29.170
<v 2>in both of our books.
Uh,
a theme that emerges to us,
uh,</v>

447
00:28:30.450 --> 00:28:33.780
nearly every day when we're working two years at a time on a,
on,

448
00:28:33.980 --> 00:28:38.490
on a book books that we could have never done these books by ourself.

449
00:28:38.580 --> 00:28:40.800
Like I couldn't have produced this book without James.

450
00:28:40.801 --> 00:28:44.820
His ability to process huge datasets and his gis expertise.

451
00:28:44.821 --> 00:28:48.340
And it's just general knowledge of cartography,

452
00:28:48.460 --> 00:28:51.910
the and computer programming,
writing custom scripts that,

453
00:28:51.970 --> 00:28:53.340
that produce those wind patterns.

454
00:28:54.690 --> 00:28:58.410
What I like to bring to the table besides the journalistic storytelling

455
00:28:58.620 --> 00:29:00.570
perspective,
is the design,

456
00:29:00.571 --> 00:29:04.710
that topography and a big part of helping a reader engage with these maps and

457
00:29:04.890 --> 00:29:07.050
pool away a story is labeling.

458
00:29:07.530 --> 00:29:12.060
And I mean every time we make a book we have to decide these basic principles of

459
00:29:12.300 --> 00:29:15.000
what does a road look like in our map.

460
00:29:15.900 --> 00:29:20.900
How do we enable a country versus a bay versus the actual animals behavior and

461
00:29:21.961 --> 00:29:22.680
tracks?

462
00:29:22.680 --> 00:29:26.670
How do we create a hierarchy a that lets the reader zero in on what they want to

463
00:29:26.671 --> 00:29:30.990
know as quickly as possible.
So I'm going to talk through one example.

464
00:29:31.140 --> 00:29:35.170
I live in Los Angeles and one of my favorite stories in the book and uh,

465
00:29:35.790 --> 00:29:39.900
the story of conservation that feels most urgent to me is about p 22 in the

466
00:29:39.901 --> 00:29:43.630
mountain lions of Angeles.
I lived near Griffith Park.
Uh,

467
00:29:43.810 --> 00:29:48.130
p 22 is a bit of an English tutor,
uh,
in Hollywood right now.

468
00:29:48.460 --> 00:29:49.750
He's got his own Twitter account.

469
00:29:49.751 --> 00:29:52.630
You can get tee shirts with his likeness on him.
Um,

470
00:29:52.660 --> 00:29:54.760
this is an incredible photograph by Steve Winter.

471
00:29:54.761 --> 00:29:58.210
He shot this for National Geographic,
uh,
using camera traps.

472
00:29:59.410 --> 00:30:03.690
And,
uh,
the problem that the mountain lions in,

473
00:30:03.900 --> 00:30:08.350
in southern California region are facing is that they're effectively marooned on

474
00:30:08.590 --> 00:30:13.270
genetic islands by the freeways.
These freeways are eight,
10,
late lanes long,
uh,

475
00:30:13.271 --> 00:30:18.271
in the Santa Monica Mountains is one population p 20 to escape out of Santa

476
00:30:18.310 --> 00:30:20.680
Monica is and got to Griffith Park where he lives by himself.

477
00:30:20.680 --> 00:30:25.390
But the chances of him getting back to the Santa Monica's to meet with another

478
00:30:25.391 --> 00:30:30.310
female are slim.
And even then,
he still mating within his own gene pool.

479
00:30:30.311 --> 00:30:34.990
So He's got a,
uh,
uh,
the prognosis for,
for his,

480
00:30:35.020 --> 00:30:38.260
uh,
genetics is not very good.
Um,

481
00:30:38.290 --> 00:30:42.080
down in the Santa Ana mountains.
Um,
you know,

482
00:30:42.100 --> 00:30:45.820
south of La Towards Orange County on the way to San Diego was another population

483
00:30:45.880 --> 00:30:49.630
of mountain lions.
And in both cases,
they really need an escape hatch.

484
00:30:49.631 --> 00:30:53.440
They need a vegetated bridge that you start to see in some other countries and

485
00:30:53.441 --> 00:30:56.120
Canada,
Slovenia,
some countries are building these forest.

486
00:30:56.121 --> 00:30:58.990
It overpasses to allow the free movement of wildlife.

487
00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:04.670
There's a proposal has been greenlighted to help mountain lions from [inaudible]

488
00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:09.390
family up in the Santa Monica Mountains get across the one on one,

489
00:31:09.910 --> 00:31:14.850
but down in the Santa Ana's,
uh,
that really hasn't,

490
00:31:15.010 --> 00:31:16.720
that proposal hasn't taken hold.

491
00:31:16.750 --> 00:31:20.380
And so I really wanted to zero in on that other Santa Ana population.

492
00:31:21.040 --> 00:31:26.040
This is a about 15 years of mountain lion tracking in southern California in the

493
00:31:26.411 --> 00:31:30.910
Santa Ana mountains.
Um,
and as we showed with the seals,

494
00:31:30.970 --> 00:31:33.760
if you just plot the data that comes out of the sensors,
uh,

495
00:31:33.880 --> 00:31:34.960
it doesn't mean a whole lot.

496
00:31:34.961 --> 00:31:38.770
So how can we start establishing context to bring the story to life for readers?

497
00:31:39.220 --> 00:31:42.430
One thing we want to do is you start wanting to lay in the terrain that the

498
00:31:42.431 --> 00:31:43.960
mountain lions are passing through.

499
00:31:44.170 --> 00:31:49.170
So we've got digital elevation models of the mountain ranges along the coast.

500
00:31:50.410 --> 00:31:53.650
And it was important to me that this book have,
uh,
have,
uh,

501
00:31:54.190 --> 00:31:58.660
come together as an ensemble and just have a color Palette and a in a visual

502
00:31:58.661 --> 00:32:02.020
field that tied all these different maps or all these different parts of the

503
00:32:02.021 --> 00:32:05.500
world,
all these different species and technologies together.
And again,

504
00:32:05.501 --> 00:32:06.970
coming from a fine arts background,

505
00:32:07.420 --> 00:32:12.070
I wanted to take these dms a little bit further.
Uh,
visually.

506
00:32:12.071 --> 00:32:14.890
And there's a technique you were in an art school called stippling.

507
00:32:15.370 --> 00:32:18.440
If you want to render an object,
the shadowed areas,

508
00:32:18.460 --> 00:32:21.820
you can just draw a lot of dots.
And in the lighter highlighted areas,

509
00:32:21.821 --> 00:32:26.560
draw fewer dots.
So working together with James Number of iterations,

510
00:32:26.561 --> 00:32:27.850
he wrote a custom script,

511
00:32:28.460 --> 00:32:32.950
a w where he could essentially take digital elevation model,

512
00:32:33.370 --> 00:32:37.600
run it through this and put lots of little dots on a stippling in the dark

513
00:32:37.601 --> 00:32:42.530
shadow areas of the mountain and fewer dots in the lower lying flat areas.

514
00:32:42.920 --> 00:32:45.290
And so you end up getting an output looking like this,

515
00:32:46.100 --> 00:32:48.970
which we used on every,
uh,

516
00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:51.710
land based map throughout the book.

517
00:32:51.740 --> 00:32:56.270
And that same technique is what gives the texture to the bothy mitre you saw in

518
00:32:56.271 --> 00:33:00.740
the seal map near Antarctica.
But then,
uh,

519
00:33:00.770 --> 00:33:04.520
there's a lot of human environments that the mountain lions are interacting
with.

520
00:33:04.970 --> 00:33:09.470
Um,
and you know,
we need to start identifying them.

521
00:33:09.471 --> 00:33:12.380
So this is me at the very beginning of the book.

522
00:33:12.410 --> 00:33:15.410
Before we even start producing a lot of these maps.

523
00:33:15.411 --> 00:33:17.330
I'm coming up with a typographic Palette,

524
00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:21.740
a series of three fonts that we can use interchangeably,
um,

525
00:33:22.170 --> 00:33:25.190
to,
you know,
how do we enable the waters,

526
00:33:25.220 --> 00:33:29.900
how do we label the city's a series of symbols a we can use to label,

527
00:33:30.040 --> 00:33:33.620
um,
mortality events or when a wolf kills an animal.

528
00:33:35.960 --> 00:33:38.030
And then,
you know,
building a template,

529
00:33:38.120 --> 00:33:42.440
an illustrator that has a hierarchy broken out so we can easily turn on and turn

530
00:33:42.441 --> 00:33:47.000
off and organize all of this contextual information.

531
00:33:49.510 --> 00:33:51.710
And so then James starts sending the exports.

532
00:33:52.300 --> 00:33:57.300
This is drainage in southern California and most of this is all these green

533
00:33:57.381 --> 00:33:58.440
little streams and,

534
00:33:58.441 --> 00:34:02.870
and temporary drainage's or seasonal drainage's or are hugely irrelevant.

535
00:34:02.900 --> 00:34:04.840
So it's an enormous,
um,

536
00:34:05.150 --> 00:34:08.240
data cleaning chore to Start Turning this into something that doesn't make your

537
00:34:08.241 --> 00:34:12.130
eyes bleed.
And then you started throwing in the road networks.

538
00:34:12.170 --> 00:34:16.580
Now this is really where the story of the human environment meets the story of

539
00:34:16.581 --> 00:34:17.480
the animal behavior.

540
00:34:17.481 --> 00:34:22.070
So this is going to be what I want to highlight in my map more than,
uh,

541
00:34:22.460 --> 00:34:23.293
the drainage.

542
00:34:24.470 --> 00:34:29.470
And we see we've overlaid this over the stippling and he's in our initial

543
00:34:29.751 --> 00:34:31.640
drafts.
You start to get something like this,

544
00:34:32.090 --> 00:34:36.380
and I've got all of the,
uh,

545
00:34:37.490 --> 00:34:42.170
data points you saw earlier and I just grade them back hoe or them darker gray

546
00:34:42.171 --> 00:34:45.170
for male lions and lighter gray for female lions.

547
00:34:45.680 --> 00:34:48.020
And then we started talking with the researcher and thinking,

548
00:34:48.021 --> 00:34:52.760
can we pull out five individuals that maybe show different behaviors?
Um,

549
00:34:53.210 --> 00:34:58.130
for instance,
the females don't have a large dispersal range.

550
00:34:58.131 --> 00:35:02.270
The female mountain lions tend to stay close to where they were born and they

551
00:35:02.300 --> 00:35:06.380
continue to raise their cubs.
Whereas you get mountain lions who,
uh,

552
00:35:06.630 --> 00:35:09.920
the male mountain lions who need to disperse out for a number of reasons.

553
00:35:09.921 --> 00:35:14.180
One being that they will be killed or eaten by the older male mountain lions if

554
00:35:14.181 --> 00:35:18.410
they don't strike out and find their own territory.
So there's this one,

555
00:35:18.411 --> 00:35:21.230
intrepid mountain lion,
a m 56,

556
00:35:21.560 --> 00:35:26.560
who leaves the Santa Ana's near Camp Pendleton appear and then comes down along

557
00:35:28.191 --> 00:35:32.630
the coast and ocean side and cuts up along the Santa Margarita River and comes

558
00:35:32.631 --> 00:35:36.950
over and is the only documented,
uh,
you know,
15 to 17 years,

559
00:35:37.310 --> 00:35:41.820
a mountain line that's crossed a west to east across I 15.

560
00:35:42.300 --> 00:35:43.960
So he gets across and you think he's home free.

561
00:35:43.961 --> 00:35:45.690
He's got this unbroken chain of wilderness,

562
00:35:45.691 --> 00:35:47.850
essentially all the way down into Mexico.
Uh,

563
00:35:48.150 --> 00:35:52.110
but he comes down here into the hot tub,
pool valley,
um,

564
00:35:52.180 --> 00:35:56.190
praise on a farmers or ranchers,
sheep.
The farmer gets a,

565
00:35:56.920 --> 00:36:01.910
uh,
depredation permit and uh,
and 56 was shot.
So,

566
00:36:02.470 --> 00:36:03.303
uh,
it's,

567
00:36:03.690 --> 00:36:07.200
the challenge is not just getting across but getting across in living long

568
00:36:07.201 --> 00:36:10.590
enough to pass on your genes.
But again,

569
00:36:11.370 --> 00:36:15.840
this wasn't really doing it for me.
The color scheme is a bit luxurious.

570
00:36:15.900 --> 00:36:18.900
Uh,
all this success of,
um,

571
00:36:20.310 --> 00:36:23.580
data points in the background of the male and female lions,
um,

572
00:36:23.910 --> 00:36:26.010
is really making harder to,

573
00:36:26.850 --> 00:36:29.160
as a reader connect with the individual stories.

574
00:36:30.510 --> 00:36:35.280
So I cleaned out all of that other data from all the other lions and just zoomed

575
00:36:35.300 --> 00:36:40.300
in and use bright highlight colors to pull out the individual stories and,

576
00:36:40.890 --> 00:36:44.580
uh,
you know,
in the hierarchy,
a subdued everything else.

577
00:36:46.350 --> 00:36:49.850
Now this is an ongoing conservation issue and it's a,

578
00:36:49.851 --> 00:36:54.460
it's a story of maybe what we did wrong,
right?
The,
the mountain lions are,
uh,

579
00:36:54.830 --> 00:36:57.450
a signal.
They tell us that maybe we've gone too far.

580
00:36:57.451 --> 00:37:01.680
There are freeways and our infrastructure is greater barrier than we had

581
00:37:01.681 --> 00:37:02.670
previously imagined.

582
00:37:02.910 --> 00:37:05.520
And we need to now take steps like creating vegetated brains,

583
00:37:05.610 --> 00:37:10.440
bridges to kind of step backward and give the wildlife a chance to,

584
00:37:10.470 --> 00:37:15.280
uh,
live in proximity to humans.
But over in Kenya,
you know,

585
00:37:15.300 --> 00:37:17.960
we're,
the infrastructure hasn't,
uh,
you know,

586
00:37:19.770 --> 00:37:21.330
been so,
uh,

587
00:37:22.770 --> 00:37:27.270
permanently in fixed on our landscape.
They're taking proactive measures.

588
00:37:27.271 --> 00:37:30.810
It's one of the first places a on a planet where they're developing your

589
00:37:30.811 --> 00:37:32.310
infrastructure with wildlife in mind.

590
00:37:32.910 --> 00:37:35.520
When the great pleasures of this book for me was to go over to Kenya and work

591
00:37:35.521 --> 00:37:36.510
with save the elephants.

592
00:37:37.290 --> 00:37:41.640
And they allowed me to join a coloring expedition in Savo National Park.

593
00:37:42.270 --> 00:37:44.580
We're recently a major railway,

594
00:37:44.581 --> 00:37:48.120
had been built from Nairobi and the center of the country to Mombasa on the

595
00:37:48.121 --> 00:37:51.400
coast.
And this railway high speed railway,
um,

596
00:37:51.530 --> 00:37:55.830
bisects Sabo national park,
right through elephant migration corridors.

597
00:37:56.460 --> 00:37:57.390
But through,

598
00:37:57.480 --> 00:38:00.180
say the elephants lobbying efforts and working with a number of local

599
00:38:00.181 --> 00:38:00.960
organizations,

600
00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:05.190
they were able to get the construction company to install these underpasses,
uh,

601
00:38:05.620 --> 00:38:08.520
uh,
points throughout the entire railway.

602
00:38:08.700 --> 00:38:12.420
It's an elevated railway and they've got these,
uh,
tunnels underneath.

603
00:38:12.421 --> 00:38:16.890
But what they didn't know was which of these many underpasses elephants were

604
00:38:16.891 --> 00:38:17.820
most likely to use.

605
00:38:17.821 --> 00:38:19.770
And if they could figure out which ones they were going to use,

606
00:38:19.771 --> 00:38:22.980
then they could target their conservation efforts and anti poaching efforts to

607
00:38:22.981 --> 00:38:27.300
those corridors.
So we coward.
I was there.
10 elephants,

608
00:38:27.301 --> 00:38:31.770
five male,
five female,
um,
they were these big,
bulky,

609
00:38:32.370 --> 00:38:34.590
um,
belts around their neck with a,

610
00:38:34.800 --> 00:38:38.680
with a counterweight on the bottom and a gps device on the top.

611
00:38:38.860 --> 00:38:42.370
It's elephants are pretty rough on these devices and they'll slam him up against

612
00:38:42.371 --> 00:38:46.290
the things they have to be pretty sturdy.
And then,
uh,

613
00:38:46.340 --> 00:38:49.630
this is just a zoom in on a larger map that we have in the book to show what

614
00:38:49.631 --> 00:38:52.120
happened after 30 days of being collared.

615
00:38:52.600 --> 00:38:57.400
And a key theme in this book is that the animals aren't these furry robots out

616
00:38:57.401 --> 00:38:59.980
there in the world following a Westworld type loop.

617
00:39:00.670 --> 00:39:04.480
They make individual decisions all the time and a couple of those individual

618
00:39:04.481 --> 00:39:08.290
decisions,
even within a species,
um,
come out on this book.

619
00:39:08.291 --> 00:39:12.690
So after being colored,
uh,
there's this one you see here in red,
you know,

620
00:39:12.700 --> 00:39:14.950
she was up coward up here off the top of the map.

621
00:39:15.370 --> 00:39:19.990
And anytime you have to subdue an animal and a color,

622
00:39:19.991 --> 00:39:24.280
it's a little bit traumatic for the animal that they incredibly can shoot a dart

623
00:39:24.281 --> 00:39:28.690
from the helicopter land,
run over,
take all their measurements,

624
00:39:28.810 --> 00:39:32.310
a pour water on the animal,
keep it's breathing airway open,
uh,

625
00:39:32.460 --> 00:39:37.460
attach to the collar and then inject a antidote that wakes the animal back up

626
00:39:37.900 --> 00:39:39.820
all within about 10 to 12 minutes.

627
00:39:40.060 --> 00:39:42.340
I couldn't believe I was watching this right in front of me.

628
00:39:42.700 --> 00:39:47.230
But after there's 12 minutes,
the animal wakes up and my Niani here,

629
00:39:47.260 --> 00:39:48.093
the red mine,

630
00:39:48.280 --> 00:39:53.280
she comes rushing down and goes right to the humans that she trusts here by the

631
00:39:54.670 --> 00:39:57.070
Kenyan Wildlife Service field training school.
And for about 30 days,

632
00:39:57.071 --> 00:40:00.940
just hung around outside the ranger school cause she knew she was safe there.

633
00:40:01.740 --> 00:40:02.470
Uh,

634
00:40:02.470 --> 00:40:07.060
a couple other ones just continued doing what they do and going over to some of

635
00:40:07.061 --> 00:40:11.200
the rivers where they like to drink.
And this guy,
Rick Kinga down here,

636
00:40:11.950 --> 00:40:14.640
he was using,
he was the first one,
uh,

637
00:40:14.710 --> 00:40:19.710
within 24 hours of being coward to use one of the underpasses and make his way

638
00:40:19.931 --> 00:40:22.540
up here and back and down.
And,
um,
you know,

639
00:40:22.541 --> 00:40:25.720
within a month he was just crossing here on a regular basis.

640
00:40:28.410 --> 00:40:28.910
<v 0>Okay.</v>

641
00:40:28.910 --> 00:40:31.520
<v 2>And here you get a sense of both sides.</v>

642
00:40:31.521 --> 00:40:35.800
So this is the railway berm under construction as we're flying in and Sabo,
uh,

643
00:40:35.870 --> 00:40:38.160
east over here in Sabah West.
Um,

644
00:40:38.720 --> 00:40:42.980
they're planning to turn this two lane road into a multilane four or five,

645
00:40:42.981 --> 00:40:43.814
six lane road.

646
00:40:43.880 --> 00:40:48.050
So that's gonna be another barrier for the elephants to get across.
But again,

647
00:40:48.680 --> 00:40:49.940
with proactive planning,

648
00:40:49.970 --> 00:40:52.220
they can build their infrastructure with wildlife in mind.

649
00:40:53.390 --> 00:40:55.810
It's just give you a sense of,
uh,

650
00:40:56.570 --> 00:41:00.800
how quickly they can get in there and,
and,
uh,
color the elephants.

651
00:41:01.280 --> 00:41:06.120
And then,
uh,
the moment when one of them wakes up.
Okay.

652
00:41:15.050 --> 00:41:17.210
Save the elephants.
Wasn't too thrilled.
The,
uh,

653
00:41:17.420 --> 00:41:21.080
some rangers spray painted a number on the side of the elephant,

654
00:41:21.081 --> 00:41:24.560
but I guess that makes it easier when they were doing their aerial surveys to

655
00:41:24.561 --> 00:41:29.210
see where,
uh,
the ones they had collared where,
but anyway,

656
00:41:29.211 --> 00:41:34.211
that's one of the hopeful stories in the book of using this of science

657
00:41:34.820 --> 00:41:35.391
<v 1>research,</v>

658
00:41:35.391 --> 00:41:40.310
technology ecology and data visualization to make sure that in humans and

659
00:41:40.311 --> 00:41:42.830
animals can coexist.
I'm looking forward.

660
00:41:48.040 --> 00:41:48.873
<v 0>Okay.</v>

661
00:41:51.480 --> 00:41:54.300
<v 1>Did you often have to deal with a untrustworthy data?</v>

662
00:41:56.290 --> 00:42:00.010
What do you mean by untrustworthy?
Like from different,
uh,

663
00:42:00.030 --> 00:42:04.960
data sample from different places and maybe you had to clean it up or just the,

664
00:42:04.961 --> 00:42:08.610
it just didn't seem like it was,
it's actually a reasonable,

665
00:42:09.270 --> 00:42:11.930
this is it.
So it's,

666
00:42:11.970 --> 00:42:15.980
it's an interesting debate actually within the community.
Um,

667
00:42:16.260 --> 00:42:21.080
about what you do with bad data.
Um,
uh,
because I was,

668
00:42:21.120 --> 00:42:24.150
you know,
there's a bit of a trend or perceived trends of academia,

669
00:42:24.210 --> 00:42:27.670
academic life where you have to be always reporting positive results and

670
00:42:27.940 --> 00:42:29.760
negative stuff's useful as well.

671
00:42:30.180 --> 00:42:35.180
And this really applies to at what stage you share your data.

672
00:42:35.551 --> 00:42:40.050
So are you sharing date data that um,
what collects it,
you know,

673
00:42:40.051 --> 00:42:42.780
the raw data collected on the device or do you,

674
00:42:42.781 --> 00:42:46.710
do you share stuff that's come through a data cleaning process?

675
00:42:47.010 --> 00:42:52.010
So we were getting data from all stages of that process.

676
00:42:52.800 --> 00:42:56.850
Now if some stuff was completely off,
like,
you know,

677
00:42:56.880 --> 00:43:01.350
gps point was a thousand kilometers away or whatever,
then then that,

678
00:43:01.550 --> 00:43:05.040
um,
you know,
there was a,
a kind of,
I did a basic cleaning operation,

679
00:43:05.041 --> 00:43:08.910
which often was a status of data reduction thing where you,
you,

680
00:43:09.060 --> 00:43:11.430
you run across and say,
why would this,

681
00:43:11.790 --> 00:43:14.760
there's no way an animal when a thousand kilometers in an hour or something like

682
00:43:14.761 --> 00:43:17.310
that.
Um,
but,
but our

683
00:43:18.920 --> 00:43:23.490
approach has always been to try and show as much of the data as possible without

684
00:43:23.640 --> 00:43:25.930
doing too much with it.
And now there's,
there's whole

685
00:43:28.340 --> 00:43:32.490
studies on how you interpolate between data points and all that kind of stuff.

686
00:43:32.570 --> 00:43:36.990
Um,
but we tried to stay out of that as much as possible and just showed specific

687
00:43:37.400 --> 00:43:40.620
that the kind of raw data as best we can because if,
if,

688
00:43:40.621 --> 00:43:43.740
if a data set's been interpolated or someone's done some modeling on it,

689
00:43:43.741 --> 00:43:46.110
then you've got to kind of explain that process as well as the reader,

690
00:43:46.111 --> 00:43:51.030
which we didn't want to do.
So the answer is yes,
the,
the word messy data points,

691
00:43:51.031 --> 00:43:51.864
but,
um,

692
00:43:53.400 --> 00:43:56.610
fewer than I expected actually given the technologies that were involved,

693
00:43:56.611 --> 00:43:57.130
I think.

694
00:43:57.130 --> 00:43:57.963
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

695
00:44:01.430 --> 00:44:05.540
<v 1>Is there a dream Dataset or dream datasets that you haven't worked with yet that</v>

696
00:44:05.541 --> 00:44:10.100
you'd really like to?
We get,
we get asked that question a lot.

697
00:44:10.430 --> 00:44:14.840
Specific to that boy or just in general on,
on the next future project.

698
00:44:14.990 --> 00:44:16.310
You're the experts.
Okay.

699
00:44:20.970 --> 00:44:23.400
Uh,
we have a third book in the works.

700
00:44:24.150 --> 00:44:27.560
I just don't know how much we want to talk about this stuff.
I mean,

701
00:44:27.570 --> 00:44:31.020
I think that the,
the dream,
so,
so,
so specific to this,
the,

702
00:44:31.440 --> 00:44:35.250
that researchers are after and they're there probably a couple of years away

703
00:44:35.251 --> 00:44:38.980
from getting his interaction social.

704
00:44:39.630 --> 00:44:41.430
So we've got the example,

705
00:44:41.431 --> 00:44:46.200
we have some aunts that they put QR codes on the backs of and use high

706
00:44:46.201 --> 00:44:50.520
resolution cameras to track and it's in these particular colonies.

707
00:44:51.060 --> 00:44:55.590
Um,
that was our largest dataset because they were getting interactions.

708
00:44:55.740 --> 00:44:59.540
Um,
uh,
and they're planning to,
to,
to the,

709
00:44:59.550 --> 00:45:00.830
there's a group to clean in,

710
00:45:00.831 --> 00:45:05.280
in Germany with the Max Planck Institute for mythology that are planning to

711
00:45:05.281 --> 00:45:10.281
deploy enough sentences that you get interact both between animals and Predator,

712
00:45:10.910 --> 00:45:15.050
prey relationships and human.
So as soon as you start bringing interactions in,

713
00:45:15.051 --> 00:45:16.710
it gets the dataset explodes.

714
00:45:16.711 --> 00:45:20.840
And so that's something that we're not quite at that stage yet.
Um,

715
00:45:21.420 --> 00:45:24.260
but that's something I think just to get our heads around.
That would be cool.
Um,

716
00:45:24.780 --> 00:45:27.540
and then I think just building on the only talked briefly,

717
00:45:27.541 --> 00:45:30.420
but when we're getting to the point where animals are backing each other up now

718
00:45:30.421 --> 00:45:31.740
with their data as well.
So

719
00:45:33.100 --> 00:45:35.960
<v 2>there's a story out of Monterey Bay Aquarium.
We,</v>

720
00:45:36.400 --> 00:45:40.670
we have a series of graphics in here on the Sea otters off California and how

721
00:45:40.671 --> 00:45:41.504
they were,

722
00:45:42.140 --> 00:45:46.130
we thought we were thought to be extinct until a small population was discovered

723
00:45:46.310 --> 00:45:48.920
back in the 30s and protected and now they've rebounded.

724
00:45:49.130 --> 00:45:52.640
And the Monterey Bay aquarium is doing all sorts of conservation efforts and

725
00:45:52.641 --> 00:45:56.930
tracking to manage that population.
And they're about to release,

726
00:45:56.931 --> 00:46:00.170
if not to have an already released it this year.
That's um,

727
00:46:00.500 --> 00:46:03.830
program called [inaudible].
But I really wanted to get into the book,

728
00:46:04.310 --> 00:46:07.460
but the technology,
Justin wasn't deployed yet by the time we had to publish.

729
00:46:07.680 --> 00:46:09.470
And net is that exact thing.

730
00:46:09.471 --> 00:46:13.430
It's this idea of getting the social behavior and interactions between mating

731
00:46:13.431 --> 00:46:18.431
males and resident females and how as an entire population they're working

732
00:46:18.981 --> 00:46:23.981
together and between buoys that whenever the auditors pass by the buoys,

733
00:46:24.351 --> 00:46:27.200
they offload their data to,
to a storage.
Um,

734
00:46:27.201 --> 00:46:29.360
and then when the honor is passed by the each other,

735
00:46:29.361 --> 00:46:32.530
they offload their data to the sensors on each honor.
Um,

736
00:46:32.600 --> 00:46:36.680
so in case anything happens to the odder,
uh,
their data isn't lost forever.

737
00:46:37.020 --> 00:46:38.690
So that's really the frontier.

738
00:46:41.820 --> 00:46:45.320
<v 1>That was awesome.
Thanks for being here.
My question is,
uh,</v>

739
00:46:45.450 --> 00:46:49.470
how much do you know about the story before you start the visualization process?

740
00:46:49.830 --> 00:46:53.850
Or do you look at a big Dataset and figuring out what's the right story to tell

741
00:46:53.851 --> 00:46:57.120
based off this?
How much do you talk to the researchers beforehand?
The research,

742
00:46:57.150 --> 00:46:57.730
this book

743
00:46:57.730 --> 00:47:01.570
<v 2>about animals,
but it's really about the researchers who study them.
I mean,</v>

744
00:47:01.571 --> 00:47:02.404
they were

745
00:47:03.970 --> 00:47:08.970
so kind to sometimes welcome us into their homes in Ohio or in Nairobi.

746
00:47:09.740 --> 00:47:13.140
I'm James went out in the North Atlantic with killer whale researchers.
Um,

747
00:47:13.960 --> 00:47:17.950
they worked with us start to finish.
Um,

748
00:47:18.040 --> 00:47:22.360
we would usually do initial interviews to try and get a sense of maybe we'd

749
00:47:22.361 --> 00:47:26.140
heard about their research in a scientific journal and then we reached out to

750
00:47:26.141 --> 00:47:30.100
them,
told them what we were doing,
and then we'd do initial to figure out,
okay,

751
00:47:30.101 --> 00:47:32.530
what,
what,
what could be cool to visualize?

752
00:47:32.531 --> 00:47:34.660
What are some of your favorite stories?
What are your,

753
00:47:34.661 --> 00:47:38.140
some of your favorite individuals who have surprised you with unique behaviors

754
00:47:38.830 --> 00:47:40.180
and then once they shared our data,

755
00:47:40.181 --> 00:47:43.360
we do initial plots and it was always a back and forth.
Okay,

756
00:47:43.390 --> 00:47:46.150
are we on the right track?
Yes,
this looks good.
And then at the end,

757
00:47:46.151 --> 00:47:48.880
when I'm coming from National Geographic I,

758
00:47:49.360 --> 00:47:53.470
my habit as a designer is to to build the visuals first and then we write the

759
00:47:53.471 --> 00:47:58.471
story last to fill in the space that the visuals have allotted for the text.

760
00:48:00.010 --> 00:48:03.190
And so once we had finished the layout and draft of the story,

761
00:48:03.191 --> 00:48:05.140
then we send it back to him for a final review.

762
00:48:05.760 --> 00:48:08.210
<v 1>Corrections.
Yeah,
just I think that was a slightly different,</v>

763
00:48:08.540 --> 00:48:12.380
that was a difference in process for the London Book of most of that was in my

764
00:48:12.381 --> 00:48:15.380
head to start with in a sense that I'd researched the city,

765
00:48:15.381 --> 00:48:16.550
I knew what was going on,

766
00:48:16.880 --> 00:48:19.550
so I knew that these would be the stories I wanted to tell.

767
00:48:19.551 --> 00:48:22.880
Whereas this was much more iterative.
It was like,
Oh,

768
00:48:22.881 --> 00:48:25.120
you show the research that the graphic we've done.
And they were like,
oh,

769
00:48:25.121 --> 00:48:25.640
well that's,

770
00:48:25.640 --> 00:48:28.940
we didn't think of it like that or that's more interesting and you'd go back to

771
00:48:28.941 --> 00:48:31.260
the drawing board.
So we have no emotions.

772
00:48:31.480 --> 00:48:35.060
<v 2>We're biologists were not,
I mean geographer designer,
but you know,</v>

773
00:48:35.090 --> 00:48:39.530
our combined skill sets to allow us to help scientists,
you know,

774
00:48:39.560 --> 00:48:40.940
share their research more widely.

775
00:48:40.941 --> 00:48:45.440
And also in some cases we surprise them with what we were able to reveal about

776
00:48:45.441 --> 00:48:47.270
what their animals were doing.

777
00:48:47.660 --> 00:48:50.360
I just want to make one more point to tack onto that.
And is that like,

778
00:48:50.390 --> 00:48:54.290
that is really for you here at Google and people who work with data and have

779
00:48:54.291 --> 00:48:56.060
these incredible skills.
Um,

780
00:48:56.090 --> 00:48:59.060
that's the beauty of this animal tracking revolution is then you don't have to

781
00:48:59.061 --> 00:49:01.250
be a biologist to get involved in conservation.

782
00:49:01.460 --> 00:49:04.700
These scientists all over the planet,
uh,
they,

783
00:49:04.770 --> 00:49:08.000
they're inundated with data like a week long study could inundate them with

784
00:49:08.001 --> 00:49:12.440
millions of data points.
Um,
so they really need people to help,

785
00:49:13.330 --> 00:49:16.270
you know,
crunch the data and,
and interpreted.

786
00:49:17.670 --> 00:49:21.660
<v 3>Um,
has either of you specifically studied cartography or worked with any</v>

787
00:49:21.661 --> 00:49:24.570
cartographers?
Obviously National Geographic for example,

788
00:49:24.571 --> 00:49:27.350
has a huge cartography department and a,

789
00:49:27.360 --> 00:49:31.410
or is it more just kind of more general graphic design principles that you work

790
00:49:31.411 --> 00:49:32.244
from?

791
00:49:32.250 --> 00:49:36.810
<v 1>So I've got no formal concert graphic training that's,</v>

792
00:49:36.990 --> 00:49:40.890
so I did joke fee degree and then uh,
uh,
fee phd,

793
00:49:40.891 --> 00:49:44.130
but none of it was ready cuts over I think.
Well,
what's interesting,

794
00:49:44.131 --> 00:49:49.050
I mean the u s is kind of ahead of this ahead of the UK in many ways is that,

795
00:49:49.690 --> 00:49:53.190
um,
there's a transition.
I think that the,

796
00:49:54.750 --> 00:49:58.260
you know,
I teach cartography to students,

797
00:49:58.261 --> 00:50:01.740
but I call it a data visualization.
Um,
because you know,

798
00:50:02.040 --> 00:50:05.490
they get paid five times as much for it if they put that on their CV for one

799
00:50:05.491 --> 00:50:10.470
thing.
And secondly,
um,
that there's a lot more to it.
I mean there's,

800
00:50:10.471 --> 00:50:10.711
there's,

801
00:50:10.711 --> 00:50:15.690
there's the good stuff about how you convey information to people and the

802
00:50:15.691 --> 00:50:19.620
standardization of things and like that visual hierarchy of labels Oliver was

803
00:50:19.621 --> 00:50:23.760
talking about when that's really important.
But increasingly,
you know,

804
00:50:23.761 --> 00:50:24.571
to make maps,

805
00:50:24.571 --> 00:50:29.300
you need to have this broader data science e type background because that's

806
00:50:29.301 --> 00:50:30.860
where the action is.
It's not where people,

807
00:50:31.130 --> 00:50:35.540
people aren't having to map new areas of the world,
you know,
for the first time,

808
00:50:35.541 --> 00:50:35.881
you know,
the,

809
00:50:35.881 --> 00:50:38.920
the frontier is really ever in these databases that are being distracted.

810
00:50:38.930 --> 00:50:39.351
Is that something,

811
00:50:39.351 --> 00:50:43.840
I'm really a kind of lobby for within this the cards graphic community,
uh,

812
00:50:44.300 --> 00:50:48.950
back in the UK at least to try and get more people with programming experience

813
00:50:50.240 --> 00:50:53.570
to learn a bit about cartography and not make the same mistakes,

814
00:50:53.571 --> 00:50:56.960
but also people who've got cartographic training to learn a bit about

815
00:50:56.961 --> 00:51:01.880
programming so they can
cut,
you know,
make the efficiency savings.

816
00:51:02.010 --> 00:51:03.710
We've been able to make it in this

817
00:51:04.720 --> 00:51:08.680
<v 2>and absolutely.
I mean by Osmosis working in national geographic for a decade,</v>

818
00:51:08.681 --> 00:51:13.120
I was immersed in their cartographic practices.
Um,
labeling styles.

819
00:51:13.510 --> 00:51:17.900
They have proprietary fonts they use.
Um,
but you know,

820
00:51:17.940 --> 00:51:19.060
there are things like,
okay,

821
00:51:19.090 --> 00:51:24.090
you can use Italics for physical features or use a different sizes of a sand

822
00:51:28.151 --> 00:51:33.090
Sarah for sitting labels.
And a lot of that was definitely informing.
Um,

823
00:51:34.030 --> 00:51:37.660
my thought process when I said about the build this type of graphic Palette.
Um,

824
00:51:38.740 --> 00:51:39.940
and,
uh,

825
00:51:41.230 --> 00:51:46.030
we actually hired one of my former colleagues in the cartography department to

826
00:51:46.031 --> 00:51:50.380
be a map editor.
So after we produced 50 some maps,
um,

827
00:51:50.890 --> 00:51:53.140
he vetted all of them,
and in many,

828
00:51:53.141 --> 00:51:56.170
many cases spotted things that I never would have picked up on my own,

829
00:51:56.171 --> 00:52:00.760
such as I had a road crossing the Niger River in Mali.
And in fact,

830
00:52:00.761 --> 00:52:04.030
there's a ferry that takes you across there and on the road.
So,
um,

831
00:52:04.530 --> 00:52:06.860
<v 1>all right,
well,
thanks again guys.</v>

832
00:52:07.640 --> 00:52:12.320
<v 0>[inaudible].</v>
