Hello everyone live here in the room and on live stream around Google.

2
00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:19.460
Kari Byron is no stranger to fans of her multiple reality based science oriented

3
00:00:19.461 --> 00:00:24.140
television shows from discovery channel's mythbusters to Netflix's white rabbit

4
00:00:24.141 --> 00:00:27.500
project to the travel channel thrill factor in many other programs.

5
00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:30.170
Carrie is also no stranger to Google.

6
00:00:30.171 --> 00:00:33.710
I had the privilege of interviewing her for toxic Google a couple of years ago

7
00:00:33.711 --> 00:00:37.520
when she cohosted the Google science fair with youtubers Samoan yet.

8
00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:40.900
And Carrie just joined stem toy companies,

9
00:00:40.901 --> 00:00:45.380
smart girls as their chief creative officer as though she hasn't had done enough

10
00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:46.243
amazing things.

11
00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:50.780
So today we're welcoming carry back to Google to talk about her autobiographical

12
00:00:50.781 --> 00:00:52.910
first book crash test girl,

13
00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:57.770
which applies the scientific method to the ups downs and in betweens of life.

14
00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:59.810
Please welcome Carrie to Google

15
00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:05.340
<v 1>[inaudible].</v>

16
00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:10.660
<v 0>I like how you entered that as her first book as if like there's going to be so</v>

17
00:01:10.661 --> 00:01:11.600
many more.
I

18
00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:14.060
<v 2>there are because your book is awesome.</v>

19
00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:16.430
So I had a chance to learn a new word galley copy,

20
00:01:16.431 --> 00:01:20.690
which is something I had to Google a,
it's a prerelease copy of the book before.

21
00:01:20.691 --> 00:01:21.430
It's totally done.

22
00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:22.460
<v 0>I had to Google it too.</v>

23
00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:27.570
<v 2>I didn't want to ask the publicist what's a galley copy cause I'd feel like I</v>

24
00:01:27.571 --> 00:01:30.060
should know that.
So,
so you didn't just write this book,

25
00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.790
you created some amazing sketches and we're going to show some of those a little

26
00:01:32.791 --> 00:01:35.520
bit and illustrations to compliment the text.

27
00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:39.390
Walk me through how you created the opportunity to write the book,

28
00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.840
not just the book itself,
but how you actually made that opportunity happen.

29
00:01:42.841 --> 00:01:44.500
And the process of writing at first book,

30
00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:49.190
<v 0>I would like it to be something very grand,
but uh,</v>

31
00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:54.140
so I was in a bar in Iowa and I was sitting around with this random group of

32
00:01:54.141 --> 00:01:57.680
people.
Um,
I mean it was,
it was Thomas Dolby,
you know,
the guy who wrote,

33
00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:00.560
she blinded me with,
if you're an audio nerd,

34
00:02:00.561 --> 00:02:04.570
you probably know who he is because he's invented so many amazing things.
Um,

35
00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:09.710
homer Hickam who wrote rocket boys,
which became October sky,
he was there.
Um,

36
00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:14.430
I had space gal,
you know,
Emily.
Okay.
Uh,

37
00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.370
also there was a storm chaser.

38
00:02:16.371 --> 00:02:21.371
Reed Timmer was there and a former astronaut and we just had this wild group of

39
00:02:21.381 --> 00:02:25.460
people that had done a speaker series and we were all hanging out closer to last

40
00:02:25.461 --> 00:02:28.850
call.
Then I'd like to admit,
and homer Hickam is like,
you know,

41
00:02:28.851 --> 00:02:32.990
we're training all these travel stories,
like you should write a book.
It's like,

42
00:02:32.991 --> 00:02:36.800
no,
I don't want to do that.
He's like,
that's what you do.

43
00:02:36.801 --> 00:02:39.170
Like writing is really hard.
Every time I do a blog,

44
00:02:39.171 --> 00:02:42.920
I agonize until the last minute and it's constantly being written in my head and

45
00:02:42.921 --> 00:02:45.740
then it's just,
it's stressful and then I write it and I'm happy,

46
00:02:45.741 --> 00:02:48.720
but that happiness is so short lived because it's just all at the end because I

47
00:02:48.721 --> 00:02:51.830
got it done and it's never perfect enough.
And he's like,
no,
just write a book.

48
00:02:51.831 --> 00:02:54.650
You've got all these stories,
you've got so many stories.
Write a book.

49
00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:59.740
And I said No.
And he basically double dog dared me and I went,
fine,

50
00:02:59.741 --> 00:03:03.010
fine,
fine.
You can let your agent call me.
So his agent called me,
said,
ah,

51
00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:05.230
homer tells me that you're going to write a book.
It was like

52
00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:11.680
at that time in the morning,
I'm not writing a book.

53
00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:16.750
And then I just kind of let it sit and I was talking to my daughter about

54
00:03:16.751 --> 00:03:19.150
something that she had going on at school,

55
00:03:19.151 --> 00:03:24.040
something that she was afraid of and I was looking at her saying the words,

56
00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:28.180
okay honey,
bravery.
It's,
it's not what superheroes have.

57
00:03:28.181 --> 00:03:32.290
It's not having super powers.
It's being scared to death and doing it.

58
00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:36.420
Anyways,
I went and I walked out the room,

59
00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:42.040
I could write a book now.
So I called back the agent.
I was like,

60
00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:46.480
how do you do this?
What do I do?
And he walked me through this,

61
00:03:46.481 --> 00:03:48.100
you got to write a book proposal.

62
00:03:48.101 --> 00:03:53.101
So I wrote a horrible book proposal that was like 90 pages long and I took it to

63
00:03:53.441 --> 00:03:57.550
some publishers and I didn't get the reception that I was hoping for.

64
00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:01.120
So I pulled it back and I actually hired someone to help me with the book

65
00:04:01.121 --> 00:04:04.420
proposal.
It's like s like a writer that's actually good at this.
I was like,

66
00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:08.260
how do I make this something that people actually want to buy?

67
00:04:08.261 --> 00:04:13.261
And so she cut into pieces and brought it down to like 30 pages instead of 90,

68
00:04:13.481 --> 00:04:15.600
which is insane.
And,
uh,

69
00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:18.850
I went back to a bunch of publishers and got a whole bunch of different offers.

70
00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:21.280
So it's really just the presentation.
I'm like,
okay,

71
00:04:21.281 --> 00:04:23.950
this is actually kind of cool.
Like writing a book is hard,

72
00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:28.330
but the learning process is amazing and it has all of the things that I've

73
00:04:28.331 --> 00:04:32.050
always preached to my daughter,
you know,
don't be scared,

74
00:04:32.051 --> 00:04:35.380
make opportunities,
you know,
learn from failure.
So the,

75
00:04:35.381 --> 00:04:39.550
the first going out with the book was somewhat of a failure,
learn from it,

76
00:04:39.551 --> 00:04:43.810
called an expert,
very mythbuster.
He went back out with it,

77
00:04:43.811 --> 00:04:47.020
got a bunch of offers,
and then all of a sudden I went,
oh no,

78
00:04:47.021 --> 00:04:49.450
I got to do it for reals.
Ah.

79
00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:53.650
So I spent a lot of time stress eating and drinking wine during the day in my

80
00:04:53.651 --> 00:04:56.230
living room.
Maybe I should be more of a role model about that.

81
00:04:56.231 --> 00:05:01.120
But that's just my process.
Um,
I took a bunch of stories from journals.

82
00:05:01.121 --> 00:05:04.420
I had a bunch of stories written on my computer already that I had written down

83
00:05:04.421 --> 00:05:05.254
along the way.

84
00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:08.830
I had videos from all of these years at mythbusters and you're like,

85
00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:12.010
talk to all my friends.
I'm still friends with a lot of the gang.
So I'd be like,

86
00:05:12.011 --> 00:05:15.190
Hey,
you remember that time?
And then I'd be like,
yes.
Oh yeah,
yeah,

87
00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:18.650
I remember that.
Taking notes,
MCAT.

88
00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:23.310
So I put together,
um,
a lot.
Uh,

89
00:05:23.311 --> 00:05:26.710
I had never realized how collaborative of book process is as well.

90
00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:29.260
You've got a designer that tells you your,

91
00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:32.920
your pictures are good or bad or the wrong size.
You've got two,

92
00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:37.060
three editors that keep coming back at you with new versions of the book that

93
00:05:37.061 --> 00:05:39.250
take entire chapters out to say things like,

94
00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:43.750
nobody wants to read about your childhood.
Okay.
That's gone.

95
00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:49.510
More embarrassing stories.
Could you give us more embarrassing stories?
Oh yes.

96
00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:52.630
Okay.
So,
you know,
finally after,

97
00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:57.660
I think it takes about a year or so before I had the end and I'd already spent

98
00:05:58.491 --> 00:06:02.360
the advance.
So I put out my version of mortified for everyone.

99
00:06:02.361 --> 00:06:07.160
There's a lot of stories that are very,
um,
I,
I make myself very vulnerable.
Um,

100
00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:10.280
I definitely talk about a lot of things that I don't think people expect it.

101
00:06:10.281 --> 00:06:14.740
It's not a science book for kids.
It really is my personal memoir and you know,

102
00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:19.520
I always like memoirs and I never liked them about people who were clean and had

103
00:06:19.521 --> 00:06:22.880
it all figured out.
I like messy people who learned it along the way.

104
00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:24.380
So that's my book

105
00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.230
<v 2>building on that.
Uh,
you know,</v>

106
00:06:26.231 --> 00:06:28.990
I wasn't sure what to expect cause I got this galley copy.

107
00:06:28.991 --> 00:06:33.070
I knew it was a book and it was about you and that's all I knew going in.
And uh,

108
00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:37.390
I was really surprised you just touched on this,
that it was so raw and personal.

109
00:06:37.391 --> 00:06:41.230
It wasn't the pristine social network fantasy that represents nobody.

110
00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:44.473
<v 0>Yes.</v>

111
00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:46.610
<v 2>It was kind of a real version of Kari Byron.</v>

112
00:06:46.611 --> 00:06:49.880
So what was it like sharing so many aspects of your private life?

113
00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:52.620
Did you draw the line anywhere?
Where were,
where did you decide,

114
00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:53.660
decide to draw the line?

115
00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:54.710
<v 0>I mean I,</v>

116
00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:59.790
I put a lot of private stuff in there and it wasn't until after I turned it into

117
00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:05.610
the editors and I realized that,
Oh my God,

118
00:07:05.611 --> 00:07:09.090
my dad and mom are going to read this and I told the story of losing my

119
00:07:09.091 --> 00:07:12.420
virginity.
I want to puke right now but I already spent the advance.

120
00:07:12.421 --> 00:07:17.421
So two eight now it's going to be a theme of this talk because pretty much go.

121
00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:20.450
<v 2>So you also narrated the audio,</v>

122
00:07:20.451 --> 00:07:22.850
but you can't do a book now pretty much without doing an audio book.

123
00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:27.350
Was that a fun,
tedious,
painful,
all the above?

124
00:07:27.810 --> 00:07:30.810
<v 0>It was somewhat excruciating for a couple reasons.
One,
I'm,</v>

125
00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:33.840
I've never liked the sound of my own voice.
I don't think anybody does,

126
00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:38.280
but that's a long period of time to listen to your own voice.
Also,

127
00:07:38.281 --> 00:07:40.320
when I read the whole thing out loud,

128
00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:44.870
I wanted to change stuff cause I had done it so silently for so long that the,

129
00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:49.140
the audio book version is actually slightly different than the finish process of

130
00:07:49.141 --> 00:07:53.250
the actual books.
So the more polished version is in words.

131
00:07:53.251 --> 00:07:56.560
So if you want to,
I prefer you read it,
then listen to,

132
00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:59.310
there are a couple of things I'm like,
that doesn't sound like me.

133
00:07:59.311 --> 00:08:01.590
What am I wrote?
That way it's no change.

134
00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:06.190
<v 2>So I want to do a little show and tell.
Now we give editing time for,</v>

135
00:08:06.850 --> 00:08:11.020
let's see.
So there's a lot of really cool art work in the book

136
00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:12.830
<v 0>and uh,</v>

137
00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:17.940
want to have carry more like sketches that mostly were in my journal that I just

138
00:08:18.490 --> 00:08:19.220
trace.

139
00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:21.600
<v 2>All right,
well there I'm not,
I can't go through all these,</v>

140
00:08:21.601 --> 00:08:25.380
but I will kind of just talk about this.

141
00:08:25.381 --> 00:08:28.470
It says love is the smile that smiles back.

142
00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:32.590
<v 0>Can I give you a little secret?
Originally that was for something.</v>

143
00:08:32.650 --> 00:08:36.580
I took it out of a journal at originally said You die alone so you might as well

144
00:08:36.581 --> 00:08:38.830
be happy with yourself.
But they didn't like that.
So

145
00:08:41.050 --> 00:08:45.480
I changed it to fit the chapter insight information.

146
00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:48.560
I've never told us about editors.
That's a good choice.
Now

147
00:08:49.130 --> 00:08:51.620
<v 2>going the other end of the spectrum,
this is um,
a,</v>

148
00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:54.320
a weapon that you could use to attack a Zombie.

149
00:08:54.780 --> 00:08:56.100
<v 0>I go through,
this is</v>

150
00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:59.220
<v 2>part of my,
my Zombie apocalypse kit.</v>

151
00:08:59.221 --> 00:09:02.880
I do really have this in my house.
It has a roll of duct tape.

152
00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:07.480
It has a machete because for some reason over Christmas,
um,

153
00:09:07.490 --> 00:09:09.840
a couple of years ago to different people gave me machetes.

154
00:09:09.841 --> 00:09:12.720
I don't know what that says about their two machetes.
One Christmas.

155
00:09:12.721 --> 00:09:15.480
So I've got one in my Zombie apocalypse kit that,

156
00:09:15.510 --> 00:09:16.680
I mean everybody has that right.

157
00:09:17.130 --> 00:09:21.150
And then a bottle of unopened champagne because at the end of the world I want

158
00:09:21.151 --> 00:09:24.360
to be able to save her a bottle,
drink the champagne.
And I have two weapons,

159
00:09:24.450 --> 00:09:29.450
very sharp bottle for a good eye socket gouge and a machete cause machete.

160
00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:31.290
So I'm a Zombie fan myself.

161
00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:34.860
Now I've had many debates and red prior companies about Zombie attack.

162
00:09:34.861 --> 00:09:37.110
So would you,
uh,
this is not one of the questions I wrote,

163
00:09:37.111 --> 00:09:39.390
but I want to ask it now is,
uh,
where uh,

164
00:09:39.391 --> 00:09:41.190
where would you rather be in a Zombie apocalypse?

165
00:09:41.191 --> 00:09:44.790
Who would you rather be in a basement?
Would you rather be in a deserted island?

166
00:09:44.791 --> 00:09:48.210
Would you rather be on a boat or would you rather be in your apartment?

167
00:09:48.750 --> 00:09:50.990
<v 0>Jamie's workshop,
Jamie's words?</v>

168
00:09:52.050 --> 00:09:56.790
<v 2>That would be a good place to be.
All right.
I'm going to choose one.
Uh,
one more.</v>

169
00:09:57.270 --> 00:10:00.570
Uh,
let's see.
Oh,
I like,
I like this one.
All right.

170
00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:03.180
Cause I think it's a good theme for the book.
The harder I work,

171
00:10:03.181 --> 00:10:07.260
the luckier I get.
And I think that there's a lot of threads in the book that,

172
00:10:07.261 --> 00:10:10.350
that tie back to this concept.
So what does that mean to you?
That state?
Yeah.

173
00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:13.910
<v 0>Well,
I know it's,
uh,
you know,
like a Thomas Jefferson quote,</v>

174
00:10:13.911 --> 00:10:15.860
but I saw the back of a tattoo parlor

175
00:10:17.780 --> 00:10:21.990
and it was just about this scrappy guy that just made his way,
uh,

176
00:10:22.130 --> 00:10:25.010
even though he had some physical disabilities and I was like,
yes,

177
00:10:25.011 --> 00:10:28.870
that guy successful because he worked very,
very hard.
And for me,
I've,

178
00:10:28.871 --> 00:10:32.390
I've never necessarily had it easy.
I mean,
yes,

179
00:10:32.391 --> 00:10:36.170
I am a white suburban girl,
so I haven't had it too hard.

180
00:10:36.171 --> 00:10:41.171
But I've always worked very hard for my opportunities from getting my job at

181
00:10:41.271 --> 00:10:42.081
mythbusters.

182
00:10:42.081 --> 00:10:46.790
Like I worked for free and busted my ass to stay in that job.

183
00:10:46.791 --> 00:10:50.060
And I've always worked very hard and it's created opportunities.

184
00:10:50.061 --> 00:10:55.061
The reason I'm sitting here now is because I keep pushing myself as much as I

185
00:10:55.791 --> 00:10:59.460
can to do weird and wild things.
And it's,
um,

186
00:10:59.570 --> 00:11:01.970
generally beyond the scope of what I'm comfortable with.

187
00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.470
I'm constantly making myself uncomfortable to get to the places I want to be.

188
00:11:07.190 --> 00:11:07.980
Cool.

189
00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:10.040
<v 2>Um,
so I love the premise of the book,
uh,</v>

190
00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:13.230
that the scientific method can be applied to life,

191
00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:15.300
not just science and engineering problems.

192
00:11:15.301 --> 00:11:18.120
And I thought that was a really cool kind of Hook for the book.

193
00:11:18.121 --> 00:11:20.730
So how do you define the scientific method,
but more importantly,

194
00:11:20.940 --> 00:11:23.090
how did that concept become the unifying theme

195
00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:23.920
<v 0>book?
Well,</v>

196
00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:28.920
I needed a good way to tell the story that was very cohesive of a lot of strange

197
00:11:28.931 --> 00:11:32.740
different pieces of my life.
And very early on in mythbusters,

198
00:11:32.741 --> 00:11:37.420
we realized that the perfect narrative vehicle for busting a myth and telling a

199
00:11:37.421 --> 00:11:41.020
story in the allotted amount of time that we had was to use the scientific

200
00:11:41.021 --> 00:11:45.450
method.
And that was sort of the start the story arc for all of our myths.
And uh,

201
00:11:45.460 --> 00:11:49.090
you know,
the scientific method is really just a tool in critical thinking.

202
00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:54.190
And so you can apply that to any decision that you have make because it's all

203
00:11:54.191 --> 00:11:56.380
really about creating a spearmint,

204
00:11:57.040 --> 00:12:02.040
this Lauren creating an experiment and then analyzing it and finding the

205
00:12:03.431 --> 00:12:05.560
conclusions that are going to help you learn.

206
00:12:05.561 --> 00:12:08.350
So whether you fail or it's things turn out well,

207
00:12:08.590 --> 00:12:10.750
it's all about going through that process.

208
00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:15.860
<v 2>So you devote an entire chapter to money among many other topics.
Um,</v>

209
00:12:16.430 --> 00:12:19.970
you weren't born with a silver spoon to carry you at all and people may not

210
00:12:19.971 --> 00:12:22.510
assume that given your success,
you really hustled tomato bills,

211
00:12:22.550 --> 00:12:25.730
you work multiple jobs nights as a sampler,
uh,

212
00:12:25.731 --> 00:12:30.350
for liquor brands arbitraging a secondhand clothing via thrift shops.

213
00:12:30.530 --> 00:12:33.410
You know,
what did you learn from those days of hustling to pay the bills?

214
00:12:33.411 --> 00:12:34.430
It helps you out today.

215
00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:38.010
<v 0>I mean,
the hustle is hard when you're young and I,</v>

216
00:12:38.050 --> 00:12:42.850
I really did learn that there's always a way,
as long as you keep looking for it.

217
00:12:42.851 --> 00:12:45.810
Like,
I really did enjoy San Francisco.
I,

218
00:12:45.890 --> 00:12:50.500
I'm sure a lot of you remember used to be just this real thrifty haven and you

219
00:12:50.501 --> 00:12:53.470
used to be able to go out to the rich suburbs and by,

220
00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:57.220
you'd look around for a designer shoes and be like,
oh,
those are fair.
Gamo yes,

221
00:12:57.221 --> 00:12:59.740
$2.
Thank you charity run by nuns.

222
00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:03.760
I'm going to go to San Francisco and sell these for 20 at the thrift store on

223
00:13:03.761 --> 00:13:06.580
Haight.
And I used to make a huge living like,
well huge.

224
00:13:06.750 --> 00:13:09.910
I W I paid the rent with that.
But you know,

225
00:13:09.911 --> 00:13:13.540
I think that I just learned that there's always a hustle somewhere and you just

226
00:13:13.541 --> 00:13:16.840
have to kind of think outside the box,
which you guys do well here.

227
00:13:17.050 --> 00:13:19.090
I think everybody probably has the hustle here.

228
00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:20.940
<v 2>I like that having the hustle.</v>

229
00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:26.220
You also touch on love and I won't get into losing virginity stories.

230
00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:28.030
Um,
awkward.
Uh,

231
00:13:28.050 --> 00:13:31.320
but you also chair this really touching anecdote about your husband and fellow

232
00:13:31.321 --> 00:13:34.590
artists.
Paul giving you the gift of 365 love letters,

233
00:13:34.830 --> 00:13:38.070
one for each day of the year,
who's had raises the bar.

234
00:13:39.790 --> 00:13:40.240
<v 0>Okay.</v>

235
00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:42.670
<v 2>A celebrity's seemed to struggle with relationships.</v>

236
00:13:42.671 --> 00:13:45.970
What is given your relationship staying power despite celebrity and I'm sure a

237
00:13:45.971 --> 00:13:48.100
lot,
and you write about imperfections along the way?

238
00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:52.580
<v 0>You know,
I,
I just,
uh,
I'm an accidental celebrity.
I'm not really a,</v>

239
00:13:52.581 --> 00:13:54.770
I'm not somebody who sought out this life in any way.

240
00:13:54.771 --> 00:13:58.010
And I live in San Francisco,
you know,
we don't have a big celebrity culture.

241
00:13:58.070 --> 00:14:02.180
And I met my husband before all of this nonsense and he's always been a big

242
00:14:02.181 --> 00:14:05.900
support to me and I'm a big support to him.
And I honestly think that,
uh,

243
00:14:07.310 --> 00:14:12.310
I fell in love with the person that felt like a chemical reaction rather than an

244
00:14:12.510 --> 00:14:16.550
analog.
Like he didn't check the right boxes,
but he just felt right.

245
00:14:17.090 --> 00:14:19.970
So for me it was more about biology than it was say.

246
00:14:20.930 --> 00:14:23.960
I think Tinder and all,
that's an amazing thing for filtering,

247
00:14:24.140 --> 00:14:27.990
but I think it's the real human contact that's going to keep you together.
Yeah.

248
00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:31.220
<v 2>And kind of human contact.
Um,
you know,</v>

249
00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:35.600
you mean you meet a lot of people in your,
in your role,
uh,

250
00:14:35.690 --> 00:14:39.770
and they know you through your media persona and you write a interestingly about

251
00:14:39.771 --> 00:14:43.460
sometimes feeling lonely went around lots of people and that you don't mind

252
00:14:43.461 --> 00:14:44.660
being alone necessarily.

253
00:14:44.661 --> 00:14:48.050
And you write about amazing experiences you've had with complete strangers.

254
00:14:48.051 --> 00:14:48.201
You know,

255
00:14:48.201 --> 00:14:52.640
what have you learned about friendship when so many people assume or want to be

256
00:14:52.641 --> 00:14:53.474
your friend?

257
00:14:53.740 --> 00:14:54.420
<v 0>Well,
I mean,</v>

258
00:14:54.420 --> 00:14:58.890
I feel like you have different places that you have different people that you

259
00:14:58.891 --> 00:14:59.101
need.

260
00:14:59.101 --> 00:15:02.520
You might have that one friend that you bicycle with in that one friend that you

261
00:15:02.521 --> 00:15:07.020
get everything you need from for a day and you may not ever see them again.
So I,

262
00:15:07.021 --> 00:15:09.490
I,
when I'm traveling a lot,
I've got that,
yeah,

263
00:15:09.510 --> 00:15:13.560
I'm not famous enough for somebody to be like pointing me out on the street.

264
00:15:13.690 --> 00:15:16.050
I can go to a bar and still hang out with a stranger.

265
00:15:16.051 --> 00:15:20.370
And sometimes I meet the most amazing people just while I'm on the road and

266
00:15:20.371 --> 00:15:24.060
having one on one conversations and I never tell them what I do for a living.

267
00:15:24.061 --> 00:15:27.810
I kind of skirt around it,
then I can have a friendship for a minute.

268
00:15:28.330 --> 00:15:28.521
<v 2>All right.</v>

269
00:15:28.521 --> 00:15:30.860
I want to do a little bit more show and tell because there's so many cool things

270
00:15:30.861 --> 00:15:35.690
back here.
All right,
so this is where editing comes in.
So tell me,

271
00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:38.780
but isn't it live streams?
This is the all the live stream.

272
00:15:38.810 --> 00:15:41.420
They can see all the unedited,
but this is going to,

273
00:15:41.580 --> 00:15:43.370
youtube is going to get the edited version.
All right.

274
00:15:43.371 --> 00:15:47.930
So tell me a little bit about this interesting piece of art.

275
00:15:49.110 --> 00:15:50.030
You see how that's,

276
00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:52.470
<v 0>so I have grown a,</v>

277
00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:57.520
a passion for black powder over the years and it's not just the explosive yeah.

278
00:15:58.030 --> 00:15:58.541
Nature of it.

279
00:15:58.541 --> 00:16:01.870
I always liked sort of the detritus sit left behind and I always noticed that

280
00:16:02.170 --> 00:16:03.370
after we do explosions,

281
00:16:03.371 --> 00:16:06.100
I would go kind of check out the mayhem that are left behind and there was a

282
00:16:06.101 --> 00:16:10.900
beautiful artistic ness to the chaos.
So I,
I have,
um,

283
00:16:11.030 --> 00:16:14.530
I will use black powder and paintings.
I will fence it off in some way.

284
00:16:14.531 --> 00:16:18.370
I always thought round things always just looked like planets to me and I try to

285
00:16:18.371 --> 00:16:20.290
control the chaos as much as possible,

286
00:16:20.291 --> 00:16:22.450
but you can't replicate it twice the same way.

287
00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:27.100
So I explode black powder of different grains and then I paint within it to try

288
00:16:27.101 --> 00:16:31.000
to make these sort of spacey like themes and interior designers seem to like

289
00:16:31.001 --> 00:16:31.970
them.
I've been like,

290
00:16:32.710 --> 00:16:36.730
I either sell them at art auctions or if you know for charity or this one's

291
00:16:36.731 --> 00:16:38.170
going into somebody's home I believe.

292
00:16:38.250 --> 00:16:41.760
<v 2>Do you have a deal of challenge that TSA if you go get on a flight right after</v>

293
00:16:41.761 --> 00:16:43.530
you've done black powder artwork,

294
00:16:43.850 --> 00:16:44.810
<v 0>I'll tell you what,</v>

295
00:16:45.050 --> 00:16:50.050
I have gone straight from the bomb range through Tsa several times with it just

296
00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:56.690
all over me exploded ordinance and didn't get tagged at all.

297
00:16:56.960 --> 00:17:01.960
But you make fun of the Tsa once on social media.

298
00:17:02.660 --> 00:17:06.290
And Tori and I are completely separate parts of the,
the,
you know,

299
00:17:06.291 --> 00:17:09.980
the lines and both of us got the serious pat down.

300
00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:13.700
Apparently they found explosives on my phone.
I mean,
it's been years and they,

301
00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:18.200
they I,
I got,
I think they're there.
I don't want to watch lists now.
So,

302
00:17:19.270 --> 00:17:19.861
<v 2>all right,
so you know,</v>

303
00:17:19.861 --> 00:17:24.710
you've actually talked about some of these last time and you graciously agreed

304
00:17:24.711 --> 00:17:29.360
to bring,
let's see if it's,
I'll hold this up for the,
so describe,

305
00:17:29.390 --> 00:17:34.160
uh,
what this little fella is and where he came to be.

306
00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:36.280
<v 0>So there,
there's,
there's two kinds of parenting.</v>

307
00:17:36.281 --> 00:17:38.650
There's the good parenting and then there's the creative parenting.

308
00:17:38.651 --> 00:17:41.590
I'm the kind of mom that like when my kid isn't brushing her teeth,

309
00:17:41.591 --> 00:17:44.140
I'll show her pictures of like meth teeth and be like,
Eh,

310
00:17:44.390 --> 00:17:47.410
you want to be like this?
I'd be like,
that's what happened to you.

311
00:17:48.340 --> 00:17:51.350
She hasn't figured out yet.
Yeah.
Googled.
So,
uh,

312
00:17:51.390 --> 00:17:56.010
these little characters are a series of creative parenting that I touch on in

313
00:17:56.011 --> 00:17:57.740
the book where my child and I,
um,

314
00:17:58.350 --> 00:18:02.580
we work through her disgusting habits and all children have so many that there's

315
00:18:02.581 --> 00:18:07.260
a lot of material there by creating these monsters that are supposed to be

316
00:18:07.261 --> 00:18:09.180
mommies manners,
monsters.
These are lessons.

317
00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:12.180
So this guy is the nail biting monster.

318
00:18:12.990 --> 00:18:15.720
It's attracted to the smell of freshly chewed nail beds.

319
00:18:15.721 --> 00:18:17.940
And when you fall asleep at night,
if you to do your nails,

320
00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:20.010
it will come in and finish them off.

321
00:18:22.140 --> 00:18:25.050
These are the booger monsters,
which they live in your nose.

322
00:18:25.051 --> 00:18:27.840
And if you go up there,
pick your nose and you steal their food,

323
00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:30.900
they're going to get hungry and go into the next available whole,

324
00:18:30.901 --> 00:18:34.020
which might be your ear and it'll go into your brain and it will eat that.

325
00:18:34.021 --> 00:18:35.070
And then you won't learn to read.

326
00:18:36.140 --> 00:18:37.170
<v 2>And just one note.</v>

327
00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:42.280
So this is a pretty macabre and kind of a,

328
00:18:42.750 --> 00:18:46.380
I think you put this out on social media,
but um,
describe what this is all,

329
00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:48.410
<v 0>I just do a lot of tiny little sculptures.</v>

330
00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:51.410
I live in San Francisco and everything has to be tiny and compact there.

331
00:18:51.411 --> 00:18:55.730
So I work a very,
very often in this size or as much,
much smaller.

332
00:18:55.731 --> 00:18:56.564
But um,

333
00:18:57.140 --> 00:19:02.140
this one was somewhere around the time of contract negotiations leave where I

334
00:19:03.201 --> 00:19:05.140
was being told to be part of the machine.
So I,

335
00:19:05.141 --> 00:19:08.090
I do a lot of sculptures that just are how I work out.

336
00:19:08.091 --> 00:19:11.540
My feelings at night is better in a little studio.

337
00:19:11.750 --> 00:19:16.350
Then say getting very angry and putting out blogs.
I,

338
00:19:17.180 --> 00:19:18.020
I make them personal

339
00:19:18.430 --> 00:19:22.480
<v 2>also.
Yes.
By doing that,
that angry email that you send in a few seconds,</v>

340
00:19:22.481 --> 00:19:24.640
a little hard to do the angry sculpture,

341
00:19:24.780 --> 00:19:28.240
you have a little more time to reflect and refine and decide.
Yeah,

342
00:19:28.380 --> 00:19:31.140
<v 0>yeah,
I make better decisions that way.
Then Facebook,</v>

343
00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:36.440
<v 2>so you write about in your book about having an artsy punk aesthetic,
uh,</v>

344
00:19:36.450 --> 00:19:39.820
about redefining yourself as a rebel.
How important is style and is that,

345
00:19:39.821 --> 00:19:42.640
how important is that for young people to think about

346
00:19:43.010 --> 00:19:45.810
<v 0>is really important to me.
When I was young it was,
I mean,</v>

347
00:19:45.811 --> 00:19:50.250
when I started mythbusters,
I had so many piercings that just,
it did,

348
00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:54.210
it all sort of kind of fell away the older I got.

349
00:19:54.270 --> 00:19:58.110
But I think that it's important to be respectful for the right places that

350
00:19:58.111 --> 00:19:59.670
you're going to like,
you know,
you're,

351
00:20:00.030 --> 00:20:03.310
you're definitely not going to wear your boobie shirt at grandmas,
but,
uh,

352
00:20:03.330 --> 00:20:06.120
I think that,
uh,
it definitely is something when you're young,

353
00:20:06.121 --> 00:20:10.440
it's a really interesting process of how you're trying to define yourself and

354
00:20:10.441 --> 00:20:11.970
the people that you were around.
Cool.

355
00:20:12.460 --> 00:20:14.010
<v 2>Ah,
so you,
there's a couple of days,</v>

356
00:20:14.011 --> 00:20:17.000
the book that kept pretty serious and I want to touch on a couple of those

357
00:20:17.001 --> 00:20:19.910
because I think it's valuable for other people going through several things.
Uh,

358
00:20:19.930 --> 00:20:22.940
you're right about that.
You like the control of sobriety.

359
00:20:23.090 --> 00:20:28.090
That said you write openly about alcohol both as a liquor brand ambassador and

360
00:20:28.131 --> 00:20:30.980
going through what you'd call a saturated period,
you know,

361
00:20:30.981 --> 00:20:33.760
what was your trigger to change your relationship with ally?

362
00:20:33.820 --> 00:20:35.020
<v 0>The hall?
I mean,</v>

363
00:20:35.021 --> 00:20:39.340
mostly it was having a job that I really cared about.

364
00:20:39.370 --> 00:20:44.030
You can't really show up with a hangover when you work with power tools though,

365
00:20:44.140 --> 00:20:46.000
you know,
it's an Australian production company.

366
00:20:46.001 --> 00:20:50.980
We had a very healthy relationship with the end of the day and uh,
you know,

367
00:20:51.430 --> 00:20:52.111
alcohol,

368
00:20:52.111 --> 00:20:57.111
like it slowly became more interesting to me to not overdo it.

369
00:20:57.850 --> 00:20:58.720
I,
um,

370
00:20:59.590 --> 00:21:04.420
I have depression and so I found that in my youth I self medicated a lot with

371
00:21:04.421 --> 00:21:06.050
alcohol and,
uh,

372
00:21:06.070 --> 00:21:09.070
it's something that I see a lot of kids do because they don't understand.

373
00:21:09.071 --> 00:21:09.904
They're depressed.

374
00:21:09.970 --> 00:21:13.090
They think that they just have problems with the world that they're in.

375
00:21:13.091 --> 00:21:14.400
And you know,
uh,
I,

376
00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:19.210
I think a lot of kids start drinking very young and very heavily to fix that.

377
00:21:19.420 --> 00:21:23.770
And so I kind of wanted to put it out there that that's what I was doing and the

378
00:21:23.771 --> 00:21:25.360
mistakes that I made.
So that maybe,

379
00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:30.370
maybe you figure out that you're going through hormonal depressions rather than

380
00:21:30.730 --> 00:21:33.280
ending up in alcoholic because you're trying to fix something that isn't

381
00:21:33.281 --> 00:21:35.530
actually a problem.
That's external.
It's internal.

382
00:21:35.620 --> 00:21:38.350
<v 2>I mean,
that's a perfect lead into an area that I thought was the most powerful.</v>

383
00:21:38.351 --> 00:21:41.220
And the book was where you talk openly about,
uh,
you know,

384
00:21:41.250 --> 00:21:44.340
wrestling with depression for many years and uh,
it,

385
00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:48.280
it is not something people would probably assume from this media persona that

386
00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:49.710
inevitably follows you around.

387
00:21:49.711 --> 00:21:53.520
So how did you become aware that you had something called depression?

388
00:21:54.290 --> 00:21:57.860
<v 0>I mean,
it really was.
When I was,
I started on mythbusters and I had my,</v>

389
00:21:57.980 --> 00:22:02.000
I had this dream job and I had a husband,
well,
he was my boyfriend at the time,

390
00:22:02.001 --> 00:22:04.820
but I had this man that I was in love with.
I had a great apartment,

391
00:22:04.940 --> 00:22:06.320
I had everything.

392
00:22:06.470 --> 00:22:08.810
And there was nothing wrong and I couldn't assign blame to anything.

393
00:22:08.811 --> 00:22:12.080
And I was like,
oh my God,
this,
this is,
this feels chemical.

394
00:22:12.081 --> 00:22:13.970
This is something that I can't control.

395
00:22:14.210 --> 00:22:16.760
And so that's when I started to address it in that way.

396
00:22:16.761 --> 00:22:20.520
And that's how I figured out how to deal with it.
But,
uh,

397
00:22:20.660 --> 00:22:25.580
the reason that I put it in the book is because I had met a woman on the road,

398
00:22:25.910 --> 00:22:29.780
um,
that a young woman,
she was in college and she was saying,

399
00:22:30.170 --> 00:22:34.220
I get depression and how do you make it through when you're trying to achieve

400
00:22:34.221 --> 00:22:36.650
these goals,
but you're weighed down.
And,
uh,
you know,

401
00:22:36.651 --> 00:22:40.880
I started to tell her I had the same thing and I could see it in her eyes that

402
00:22:40.881 --> 00:22:44.480
it was almost like relief to her that this person that she saw on TV that she

403
00:22:44.481 --> 00:22:46.490
thought was always happy and always had it together,

404
00:22:46.790 --> 00:22:50.630
had the same thing that she had.
And she it,
it seemed to,
you know,

405
00:22:50.660 --> 00:22:53.210
it touched her and she told me later she's like,

406
00:22:53.211 --> 00:22:57.200
that really helped me when and hype like okay well if I can do that,

407
00:22:57.620 --> 00:22:59.900
I mean I might as well put it in the book.
What have I got to lose?

408
00:22:59.901 --> 00:23:01.700
I can help somebody possibly with it

409
00:23:01.940 --> 00:23:05.150
<v 2>and you you tried everything.
You've tried to all kinds of different strategies,</v>

410
00:23:05.151 --> 00:23:08.090
medicinal strategies,
toughing it out,
strategies,

411
00:23:08.091 --> 00:23:11.450
everything in between what have and and different things will work for different

412
00:23:11.451 --> 00:23:11.691
people.

413
00:23:11.691 --> 00:23:16.040
What has helped you manage depression even though it's probably always going to

414
00:23:16.041 --> 00:23:16.874
be with you for the rest

415
00:23:17.190 --> 00:23:18.300
<v 0>scientific method?</v>

416
00:23:19.470 --> 00:23:23.460
I did a lot of experimenting and I mean for me personally being somebody who

417
00:23:23.461 --> 00:23:27.390
likes the dark rd side,
I medicating didn't work for me.

418
00:23:27.391 --> 00:23:29.220
I found the side effects horrendous.

419
00:23:29.221 --> 00:23:33.270
I found it very difficult and I tried and tried in different ways and I honestly

420
00:23:33.271 --> 00:23:37.020
find out I go completely sober.
I I exercise like a,

421
00:23:37.350 --> 00:23:42.180
like a crazy person for the endorphins.
I eat super duper healthy and I don't,

422
00:23:42.630 --> 00:23:46.160
I know that it's going to pass,
which is now I know what it is.

423
00:23:46.161 --> 00:23:48.860
I know it's going to go away.
It's made it a lot easier.

424
00:23:48.861 --> 00:23:53.180
I also put myself in social situations with other people.

425
00:23:53.330 --> 00:23:58.330
I find that it actually really helps to not lock myself away and hide it.

426
00:23:59.540 --> 00:24:02.930
<v 2>Well thanks for sharing that so openly in the book cause there's other people</v>

427
00:24:02.931 --> 00:24:04.900
that will probably never would have assumed that,
you know,

428
00:24:04.910 --> 00:24:05.780
will make a difference.

429
00:24:05.990 --> 00:24:09.740
So just a couple more questions before I open it up to the Dory and the folks in

430
00:24:09.741 --> 00:24:11.150
the room.
Um,

431
00:24:11.260 --> 00:24:13.730
<v 0>so you actually read the book,
a lot of people that interview me or Oh,</v>

432
00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:15.750
I just asked mythbuster questions the whole time.

433
00:24:16.570 --> 00:24:18.910
<v 2>No,
I actually read the book.
I read the book on a,
on a,</v>

434
00:24:18.911 --> 00:24:21.700
on a flight to Nashville actually.
And a,

435
00:24:21.701 --> 00:24:26.500
it is a perfect four hour round trip length flight book.

436
00:24:26.710 --> 00:24:30.550
<v 0>Oh,
fantastic.
Airport book stores.</v>

437
00:24:32.620 --> 00:24:34.290
Exactly.
Exactly.

438
00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:35.560
<v 2>So,
um,</v>

439
00:24:35.670 --> 00:24:39.680
mythbusters was an amazing contribution to reality television and it was really

440
00:24:39.681 --> 00:24:41.420
sad on the show.
Inevitably came to an end.

441
00:24:41.450 --> 00:24:46.280
You dedicate an entire chapter to setbacks,
including how mythbusters ended.

442
00:24:46.580 --> 00:24:49.580
What have you learned from those setbacks that help you going forward?

443
00:24:50.100 --> 00:24:50.921
<v 0>I mean,
I,</v>

444
00:24:50.921 --> 00:24:54.180
I thought that the world was ending for a minute when I left mythbusters,

445
00:24:54.181 --> 00:24:57.810
cause that had been my first,
you know,
it was just such a huge job.
It was,

446
00:24:57.811 --> 00:25:01.020
it was over a decade long and it was everything I knew and it was everything

447
00:25:01.021 --> 00:25:04.380
that I'd put in all my passion and heart into for so long that I was suddenly

448
00:25:04.381 --> 00:25:08.130
completely unqualified to do anything else because nobody needs you to drive a

449
00:25:08.131 --> 00:25:13.110
forklift and you know,
blow things up in regular jobs.
I was terrified.

450
00:25:13.111 --> 00:25:13.861
I went to the mall,

451
00:25:13.861 --> 00:25:17.880
I bought a pair of theory slacks that was about to get my linkedin already.

452
00:25:17.881 --> 00:25:20.680
I'm just saying,
okay,
I don't know if this is God.

453
00:25:20.730 --> 00:25:24.870
There's just no boxes for what I do.
I have no idea.
So,
you know,

454
00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:29.550
being able to kind of gather myself from that and like,
okay,

455
00:25:29.820 --> 00:25:32.760
what do I like to do?
What do I want to do?
Okay,
I like this TV thing.

456
00:25:32.761 --> 00:25:34.740
Maybe I can do this TV thing.
I'm going to keep going.

457
00:25:34.741 --> 00:25:37.980
So I actually just started going out and pitching shows on my own and letting

458
00:25:37.981 --> 00:25:40.680
people know that I'm still here and I'm ready to work on other things.

459
00:25:40.681 --> 00:25:43.800
And other shows started showing up.
They're like,
oh,
mythbusters is over.

460
00:25:43.801 --> 00:25:47.250
Come over here.
Yeah.
Travel channels.
Like we would love you to come,

461
00:25:47.310 --> 00:25:50.640
come do science on roller coasters.
And it was,

462
00:25:50.690 --> 00:25:55.690
it was a good lesson that life continues beyond even when the wonderful things

463
00:25:56.040 --> 00:25:58.560
in.
So,
uh,
that's why I've,

464
00:25:58.590 --> 00:26:02.790
I've continued on with TV and I'm moving into a new fun fields myself now.

465
00:26:02.850 --> 00:26:03.130
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

466
00:26:03.130 --> 00:26:07.990
So it's a perfect lead into my last question cause it's a,

467
00:26:07.991 --> 00:26:12.400
your next gig.
Um,
you've recently joined a cool startup.
Smart girls is there?

468
00:26:12.910 --> 00:26:16.540
Yes.
Got To do show and tell.
This is their last show and tell.
Okay.
So you,

469
00:26:17.110 --> 00:26:17.950
um,

470
00:26:18.430 --> 00:26:23.260
I'm looking forward to understanding more about the cool startup smart girls

471
00:26:23.261 --> 00:26:26.040
that you recently joined as their chief creative officer,
uh,

472
00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:31.230
that's creating self-balancing programmable robots targeting girls,
uh,

473
00:26:31.300 --> 00:26:32.250
with action dolls.

474
00:26:32.290 --> 00:26:36.280
What will your role be and how did you get connected this opportunity?

475
00:26:36.310 --> 00:26:41.140
And you should definitely show this.
It's really cool.
Ck,
show it on the floor.

476
00:26:41.260 --> 00:26:44.280
Let's see.
I think probably here,

477
00:26:44.290 --> 00:26:45.790
<v 3>right in the middle.
Guys over,</v>

478
00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:49.440
<v 0>not invent this.
I,
uh,</v>

479
00:26:52.770 --> 00:26:55.740
<v 3>so it's like a little segue.
I don't want her to drop off.</v>

480
00:26:57.240 --> 00:27:00.840
Hold on.
Thank you.
She's trying to learn to self balance.
So,

481
00:27:01.420 --> 00:27:06.120
uh,
almost,
yeah.
Well she jumps off the edge.
It'll be more like me.

482
00:27:06.150 --> 00:27:09.540
Well that'll be a,
that will be a mythbusters moment.
So there you go.

483
00:27:09.570 --> 00:27:12.950
Got Her little segway.
She does that to self balance.
So I,
I

484
00:27:13.550 --> 00:27:14.700
<v 0>when,
um,</v>

485
00:27:17.900 --> 00:27:22.520
I thought to myself,
what do I want to do besides TV?
Because I like TV,

486
00:27:22.521 --> 00:27:27.380
but I am,
it started,
you know,
it's,
it's,
it's feast or famine.
It's a little like,

487
00:27:27.760 --> 00:27:31.430
uh,
sooner or later I want to do something new and I always wanted to do toys and

488
00:27:31.431 --> 00:27:34.610
that's next on my bucket list is I want to work in toys.

489
00:27:34.970 --> 00:27:39.970
So I just started getting on the Google and researching places that did it and

490
00:27:40.581 --> 00:27:44.620
how they did it and what they did.
And I,
I talk to everybody I knew,
um,

491
00:27:44.690 --> 00:27:46.780
about connections.
And,
um,

492
00:27:46.910 --> 00:27:50.840
just a friend had talked to a guy who was involved in this company.

493
00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:55.340
I cold called him and asked him out to coffee to pick his brain.

494
00:27:55.341 --> 00:27:59.720
And by the end he's like,
wow,
you might be,
this is kind of your brand.

495
00:27:59.721 --> 00:28:02.200
I mean this is a stem for girls brands.

496
00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:07.200
So this is a doll on his self balancing robot that is completely codeable and it

497
00:28:08.151 --> 00:28:12.500
teaches block coding to girls using their tablet or their phone so that the DOL

498
00:28:12.501 --> 00:28:17.090
can move through challenges.
It can dance music comes out of it,

499
00:28:17.390 --> 00:28:20.660
but it speaks to the way girls play,
which is a,

500
00:28:20.661 --> 00:28:23.330
they do a lot more storytelling.
And um,

501
00:28:23.450 --> 00:28:26.660
I feel like at one point the whole revolution was okay,

502
00:28:26.661 --> 00:28:28.610
we got to teach girls stem.

503
00:28:28.790 --> 00:28:31.670
So don't make anything pink because that's,

504
00:28:31.671 --> 00:28:34.340
that's too girly and stem doesn't have to be girly.

505
00:28:34.341 --> 00:28:36.740
And I feel like now that the revolution against the revolution is,

506
00:28:37.250 --> 00:28:39.470
or the girls that like pink,

507
00:28:39.530 --> 00:28:42.860
let's also teach them coding and computer science.

508
00:28:42.861 --> 00:28:46.070
Let's make toys for everyone.
And this,

509
00:28:46.071 --> 00:28:50.660
this is supposed to reach girls at the age that they stopped being interested in

510
00:28:50.661 --> 00:28:54.230
coding and computer science because all the toy start getting very masculine.

511
00:28:54.240 --> 00:28:58.370
They're robots in their cars and they're things that destroy.

512
00:28:58.371 --> 00:29:03.371
Whereas my daughter who's in love with Minecraft and loves coding is now one of

513
00:29:03.801 --> 00:29:08.150
only two girls in her entire afterschool program because every year they dropped

514
00:29:08.151 --> 00:29:08.871
off,
they dropped off,

515
00:29:08.871 --> 00:29:13.871
they dropped off because she likes to code in ways that create stories and she

516
00:29:14.181 --> 00:29:17.300
makes these big castles that all have a reason for everything.

517
00:29:17.301 --> 00:29:21.230
And then the boys in the class go in and blow it up.
So it's,

518
00:29:21.231 --> 00:29:23.330
they're both really good.
It's just,

519
00:29:23.331 --> 00:29:28.331
I think that sometimes we need to make it easier for girls to continue on in

520
00:29:28.611 --> 00:29:31.280
this field.
So,
um,
this is just the launch toy.

521
00:29:31.310 --> 00:29:34.040
This is the one that it was seen on shark tank and that's where they got their

522
00:29:34.041 --> 00:29:36.050
start.
Oh,
cool.
Um,
and uh,

523
00:29:36.051 --> 00:29:40.100
they want out of like 40,000 companies and they've got such a great hustle going

524
00:29:40.101 --> 00:29:42.880
on that I met the founder and I was just like,
yeah,

525
00:29:43.090 --> 00:29:44.920
I would like to join with you guys.

526
00:29:44.921 --> 00:29:47.710
I'm going to help them in their next round of seed funding so that we can

527
00:29:47.711 --> 00:29:51.550
actually start making more.
And then I've got a bunch of new coding toys that are

528
00:29:53.890 --> 00:29:55.300
probably be coming out by Christmas.

529
00:29:55.500 --> 00:29:58.140
<v 2>Awesome.
That is so cool.
So,
um,</v>

530
00:29:58.170 --> 00:30:02.610
we're now going to shift to audience and Dory questions.
But before I do,

531
00:30:03.060 --> 00:30:05.790
I have two copies of the book.
I learned that as I mentioned for this,

532
00:30:05.791 --> 00:30:10.110
the Galley copy,
the one that I actually read with all the galley copy you,

533
00:30:10.111 --> 00:30:14.700
I didn't know what it meant so I googled it.
So Galley copy is a,
a,

534
00:30:14.701 --> 00:30:17.560
a prerelease copy of the book.
Not entirely finished there.

535
00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:21.930
I someday we'll read the released coffee to see what the differences are,

536
00:30:21.931 --> 00:30:22.920
how significance of the diff,

537
00:30:23.090 --> 00:30:25.280
<v 0>yeah,
they're not significant,
but to me they were,</v>

538
00:30:25.281 --> 00:30:27.710
they were important changes to me.
They're very small.

539
00:30:28.110 --> 00:30:30.530
<v 2>So the uh,
the book is fantastic.</v>

540
00:30:30.580 --> 00:30:34.890
Strongly recommend you pop out your smartphone right now in order up a copy.

541
00:30:34.891 --> 00:30:39.090
And I see that our copies already in the audience just came out and uh,

542
00:30:39.091 --> 00:30:42.960
it's just a really good reason.
It's very unexpected.
So with that,
um,
uh,

543
00:30:42.961 --> 00:30:44.520
we will get a,

544
00:30:44.670 --> 00:30:49.470
my assistant who's an engineer with our team to get the microphone.
All right.

545
00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:53.720
<v 4>Uh,
thanks for coming in the book.
I haven't quite finished yet,
but it's great.</v>

546
00:30:53.721 --> 00:30:58.520
It reads like it's so easy and interesting.
I really appreciated.

547
00:30:58.550 --> 00:31:02.450
Uh,
and you touched on it a little bit already that you were very honest about

548
00:31:02.480 --> 00:31:06.560
dealing with depression and how it was hard on Paul.
Also,

549
00:31:07.040 --> 00:31:12.040
I'm wondering if you have any advice for people who find themselves in Paul's

550
00:31:12.231 --> 00:31:15.350
place who want to help but don't know how to do.
So

551
00:31:15.690 --> 00:31:19.020
<v 0>it's really tough when you're married to somebody who does have depression.</v>

552
00:31:19.021 --> 00:31:22.320
And I think that in any family it's very difficult because you want,

553
00:31:22.350 --> 00:31:26.310
you take it very personally,
like when that person is sad or angry,

554
00:31:26.311 --> 00:31:27.810
it's always gonna feel like it's at you.

555
00:31:27.811 --> 00:31:31.230
I think that the most important thing is to just remember it's not you and you

556
00:31:31.231 --> 00:31:34.020
also have to just take care of yourself.
You know,
the,
the,

557
00:31:34.021 --> 00:31:38.150
the partner of someone who's depressed has to really understand that it's,

558
00:31:38.151 --> 00:31:42.950
it's not something that they caused and,
um,

559
00:31:43.560 --> 00:31:45.270
just be as understanding as possible.

560
00:31:45.271 --> 00:31:49.470
But I think it's also the depressed person has to as well be very understanding

561
00:31:49.471 --> 00:31:49.651
of that.

562
00:31:49.651 --> 00:31:53.550
That that situation is something that is going to happen and that you have to

563
00:31:53.551 --> 00:31:58.320
take extra care of each other.
Great question.
Thank you.
All right,

564
00:31:58.360 --> 00:31:59.640
next take another one from the room.

565
00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:01.233
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

566
00:32:03.370 --> 00:32:05.350
<v 5>So sort of a two part question.
Um,</v>

567
00:32:06.040 --> 00:32:08.740
we become who we are from our experiences.

568
00:32:09.250 --> 00:32:11.830
So would you say that everything you've gone through in your life has been

569
00:32:11.831 --> 00:32:16.831
necessary or would present day you go back in time and try to change something

570
00:32:17.231 --> 00:32:18.100
that you did in the past?

571
00:32:18.620 --> 00:32:22.280
<v 0>That was it.
Something somebody asked me and I put some of it in the book,
uh,</v>

572
00:32:22.340 --> 00:32:25.160
Present Day me,
we'd go back and invest in Google.

573
00:32:26.720 --> 00:32:31.220
I would have stocks in all of that.
That would be amazing.
But,
uh,

574
00:32:31.221 --> 00:32:31.761
yeah,

575
00:32:31.761 --> 00:32:36.440
I mean it definitely took a lot of tripping and falling and I don't think that I

576
00:32:36.441 --> 00:32:41.441
would be here or be as happy I am with my life now if I hadn't had all of these

577
00:32:42.051 --> 00:32:46.850
scary,
awful experiences are wonderful experiences.
So,
um,

578
00:32:47.330 --> 00:32:49.520
I,
you know,
I wouldn't say I don't regret anything.

579
00:32:49.521 --> 00:32:51.230
I just say I've definitely learned a lot.

580
00:32:52.830 --> 00:32:56.280
<v 2>So from the,
from the dories somewhere out on the live stream.
So what's this,</v>

581
00:32:56.390 --> 00:32:57.540
you probably get this question quite a bit.

582
00:32:57.541 --> 00:33:00.750
What's the myth you most want to have revisited because you think it has to be

583
00:33:00.751 --> 00:33:04.410
true but was busted on the show?
That has to be just to be true.

584
00:33:04.411 --> 00:33:05.520
It was busted on the show,

585
00:33:05.521 --> 00:33:08.100
but it just didn't feel like it should have been busted.

586
00:33:08.600 --> 00:33:10.880
<v 0>Uh,
I don't know.</v>

587
00:33:10.881 --> 00:33:15.500
I kind of agreed with most of our results except for fireworks,
man.
I was really,

588
00:33:15.590 --> 00:33:17.920
I,
uh,
fireworks man where we,

589
00:33:17.921 --> 00:33:22.460
we launched a guy with fireworks and I feel like the producers wanted it to not

590
00:33:22.461 --> 00:33:26.420
be real.
So,
um,
they came up with a different conclusion that I came up with,

591
00:33:26.421 --> 00:33:30.860
but in the end it was the group ruled against me.
So I,
you know,

592
00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:33.650
I wouldn't want to actually retest that one cause it was kind of ridiculous.

593
00:33:35.670 --> 00:33:36.021
In fact,

594
00:33:36.021 --> 00:33:39.870
I have most of them I'm pretty satisfied with how they came out in the end.
Yeah.

595
00:33:40.440 --> 00:33:42.420
<v 2>I think you made a big difference around the uh,</v>

596
00:33:42.421 --> 00:33:46.410
the cell phone at the gas station.
Yeah.
I love that myth.

597
00:33:46.411 --> 00:33:50.160
I thought that had a very positive impact on gas stations that used to put a

598
00:33:50.161 --> 00:33:52.560
sticker,
no cell phone near the gas even though it's totally okay.

599
00:33:52.860 --> 00:33:56.580
<v 0>I would like people to stop firing bullets into the air when they're celebrating</v>

600
00:33:56.581 --> 00:33:59.790
because we know that they come to like that was another one that I thought was

601
00:33:59.791 --> 00:34:04.650
very good that we actually had some statistical research happening from the
show.

602
00:34:04.980 --> 00:34:06.510
Also,
the one that I really,

603
00:34:06.511 --> 00:34:10.440
really like people to believe is the airport lines.

604
00:34:10.441 --> 00:34:15.390
When you are boarding a plane where it doesn't matter what the zones you are,

605
00:34:15.391 --> 00:34:17.860
if everybody just boards and does it efficiently,
the,

606
00:34:17.861 --> 00:34:20.700
the most efficient people will generally get to the front of the line and

607
00:34:20.701 --> 00:34:23.370
they'll do everything quickly.
And then the slacker people,

608
00:34:23.371 --> 00:34:26.250
which somehow always end up in first class just like,
oh,

609
00:34:26.251 --> 00:34:29.730
I ain't let me put my dog here.
And they're always in the front.

610
00:34:29.731 --> 00:34:33.840
And I think it'd be so much faster if we just let nature take its course

611
00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:38.070
<v 2>or,
or you know,
we feel very strongly a fly a lot.</v>

612
00:34:38.100 --> 00:34:42.720
Every time you fly you should have like you should be timed and then your next

613
00:34:42.721 --> 00:34:46.170
flight is adjusted based on how you performed the last time.

614
00:34:46.350 --> 00:34:48.870
And then that will sort it all out and all that time.

615
00:34:48.871 --> 00:34:50.850
And the people that don't mind,
I don't mind taking a long time.

616
00:34:50.851 --> 00:34:54.090
There'll be at the end and they don't care.
Yeah.
So we've got other from the,
uh,

617
00:34:54.091 --> 00:34:55.980
from the audience.
Here we go.

618
00:34:57.770 --> 00:35:01.800
<v 0>Right.
Hi.
So I,
Oh man,
I haven't read the book yet,</v>

619
00:35:01.801 --> 00:35:04.440
but it seems you've done a lot of traveling in your time.

620
00:35:04.441 --> 00:35:08.130
And I was wondering what the biggest piece of advice you have for someone who

621
00:35:08.131 --> 00:35:11.500
will be spending some time in an unfamiliar place?
Hmm.
Um,

622
00:35:11.501 --> 00:35:14.980
it depends on con in different countries.
Um,
if you're in Egypt,

623
00:35:15.070 --> 00:35:17.710
you didn't drop anything no matter how many people say,
hey,

624
00:35:17.711 --> 00:35:22.480
you dropped something,
don't stop and turn around.
You didn't drop anything.

625
00:35:22.660 --> 00:35:24.430
I would say it would be my best piece of advice,

626
00:35:24.431 --> 00:35:29.431
but I think sometimes you got to not look at the travel blogs and just,

627
00:35:30.760 --> 00:35:34.300
just let it go and explore because I think that's the most interesting part of

628
00:35:34.301 --> 00:35:38.160
traveling is just stumbling things.

629
00:35:38.161 --> 00:35:41.910
Like it's great to kind of have a,
an idea of where you're going.

630
00:35:41.911 --> 00:35:45.030
But I generally like,
uh,
you know,
even in the United States,

631
00:35:45.031 --> 00:35:49.950
like we do a lot of filming in places like Philadelphia for example.

632
00:35:49.950 --> 00:35:54.030
I,
I knew that I had six hours before I had to be anywhere.

633
00:35:54.031 --> 00:35:59.031
So I looked for the best vegan cheese steak I could find and it was miles away.

634
00:36:00.571 --> 00:36:01.404
I'm like,
okay,

635
00:36:01.500 --> 00:36:04.080
I'm going to walk there no matter what neighborhood I have to walk through.

636
00:36:04.290 --> 00:36:09.290
And along the way I found so many cool things like art galleries and Weirdo

637
00:36:09.601 --> 00:36:14.460
people and just like oddities shops and you know the motor museum was on the
way,

638
00:36:14.461 --> 00:36:17.950
which is the medical oddities museums.

639
00:36:17.951 --> 00:36:22.020
So I found so much craziness along the way just to get to the vegan cheese steak

640
00:36:22.021 --> 00:36:25.590
and it was the journey,
not the reward.
It was delicious by the way,

641
00:36:25.690 --> 00:36:29.340
but I had this whole entire adventure because instead of like,
okay,

642
00:36:29.341 --> 00:36:31.500
I can sit in this hotel room for six hours,

643
00:36:31.710 --> 00:36:36.710
I made some sort of just arbitrary destination and just let my feet take me into

644
00:36:36.721 --> 00:36:37.554
the weird,

645
00:36:37.670 --> 00:36:40.010
<v 2>we'll take one more from the door and one more from the audience.</v>

646
00:36:40.011 --> 00:36:42.920
So I'm sure you get asked this a lot to the,

647
00:36:43.190 --> 00:36:45.710
you had a chance to do mythbusters again.

648
00:36:45.711 --> 00:36:48.050
What'd you or is that kind of part of your life?

649
00:36:48.051 --> 00:36:51.890
Kind of had a wonderful book ends and you know that,
that's that,

650
00:36:52.160 --> 00:36:54.260
<v 0>I don't know,
cause mythbusters campy mythbusters again,</v>

651
00:36:54.261 --> 00:36:57.740
because I've learned a bunch from mythbusters and the whole amazing thing of the

652
00:36:57.741 --> 00:36:58.251
journey is,

653
00:36:58.251 --> 00:37:03.251
is that I had no idea what I was doing at all from the beginning.

654
00:37:03.381 --> 00:37:07.010
Like everybody thought mythbusters was a science showed it wasn't a science
show.

655
00:37:07.011 --> 00:37:08.300
None of us have a science background.

656
00:37:08.301 --> 00:37:12.350
We all were just experiencing it together and learning together.

657
00:37:12.620 --> 00:37:15.200
And I almost feel like a,
at this point,
I might be,

658
00:37:15.920 --> 00:37:20.890
I don't know if I would have the same giant reactions to things because I kind

659
00:37:20.891 --> 00:37:22.190
of know when stuff's going to blow up now.

660
00:37:22.640 --> 00:37:24.800
So I'm not sure if I could do it again.

661
00:37:25.070 --> 00:37:26.450
<v 2>Cool.
So who wants to be our last</v>

662
00:37:26.530 --> 00:37:30.190
<v 0>question?
Are down here.</v>

663
00:37:31.540 --> 00:37:32.830
No pressure.
You're the last question.

664
00:37:36.310 --> 00:37:38.700
<v 6>The dummy.
I fixate on mythbusters,
but um,</v>

665
00:37:38.850 --> 00:37:40.810
<v 0>it's okay.
That was like,
that's the whole reason I'm here.</v>

666
00:37:42.440 --> 00:37:44.120
<v 6>Jimmy and Adam have been pretty open,</v>

667
00:37:44.121 --> 00:37:48.480
but the sort of chemistry or lack thereof,
um,

668
00:37:48.950 --> 00:37:49.730
at Google we have,

669
00:37:49.730 --> 00:37:53.570
we talk a lot about cultural fit when we talk about a candidate.
Um,

670
00:37:53.780 --> 00:37:55.800
but it sort of seems that,
you know,

671
00:37:55.830 --> 00:37:59.270
their lack of chemistry has actually produced something really great.

672
00:37:59.600 --> 00:38:01.580
That lesson,
you know,
for as long as it did.

673
00:38:01.880 --> 00:38:05.420
Do you think is that you're more important for a successful project to have good

674
00:38:05.421 --> 00:38:10.421
team chemistry or how that clash of personalities that the two I guess host had?

675
00:38:11.630 --> 00:38:14.030
<v 0>Well,
you can have a clash of personality,</v>

676
00:38:14.031 --> 00:38:19.031
but you still have to have a respect for each other and what you bring to the

677
00:38:19.341 --> 00:38:24.230
table.
When that's gone,
it's over.
Like I,
I,
my team with Tory and grant and I,

678
00:38:24.231 --> 00:38:29.231
we had amazing chemistry and so the three of us had the same,

679
00:38:30.110 --> 00:38:33.190
you know,
a fun mythbuster.
He results then,
you know,

680
00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:36.130
Jamie and Adam that had the clash.
But I think that the,

681
00:38:36.131 --> 00:38:39.790
the common thread is that we all respected each other's skill set and what we

682
00:38:39.791 --> 00:38:43.810
brought to the table and appreciated the diversity because I really do think

683
00:38:43.811 --> 00:38:48.010
that diversity is the best way to solve any problem.
Cool.
And,
uh,
you know,

684
00:38:48.240 --> 00:38:51.730
we still all hang out.
I still tortured story all the time.

685
00:38:51.731 --> 00:38:55.780
We still prank each other a lot.
That's kind of my dream is to have a prank show.

686
00:38:56.850 --> 00:38:59.280
<v 2>What's your favorite,
uh,
praying if you could choose this one.</v>

687
00:38:59.281 --> 00:39:01.200
You talk about some of this in the book.
The pranks.

688
00:39:01.780 --> 00:39:04.270
<v 0>I mean on mythbusters we did a lot of different pranks,</v>

689
00:39:04.271 --> 00:39:07.990
but a Tory and I at one point trying to create a prank show.

690
00:39:07.991 --> 00:39:09.820
It didn't get bought,
but uh,
we,

691
00:39:10.090 --> 00:39:14.050
we actually perpetrated an amazing prank on some unknowing people that thought

692
00:39:14.051 --> 00:39:16.300
they were on a reality show.
Uh,
we,
uh,

693
00:39:17.440 --> 00:39:22.440
we brought them into watch the price per the process of cryogenics and um,

694
00:39:23.020 --> 00:39:28.020
told them that it was all real and then had the cryogenically frozen people turn

695
00:39:28.181 --> 00:39:29.230
into zombies and attack them

696
00:39:29.300 --> 00:39:34.300
<v 3>and it was hard and I am dying to put it onto the youtube at some points</v>

697
00:39:36.030 --> 00:39:38.370
<v 0>secretly maybe somebody elite.</v>

698
00:39:38.460 --> 00:39:41.820
<v 3>Okay,
cool.</v>

699
00:39:42.710 --> 00:39:46.200
<v 0>That was the funniest I ever,
I ever perpetrated myself on a grand scheme.</v>

700
00:39:46.201 --> 00:39:47.460
But other than that,

701
00:39:47.461 --> 00:39:52.020
Tory's made me vomit a lot by drinking things that I thought were bodily fluids

702
00:39:52.021 --> 00:39:55.860
that were actually just like he switched it with some special effects.

703
00:39:56.160 --> 00:39:59.520
Like all of a sudden he's drinking an entire beaker of old saliva and I'm

704
00:39:59.580 --> 00:40:03.450
throwing up on the floor,
but it turns out it was just tea and he's a jerk.

705
00:40:05.050 --> 00:40:05.883
<v 3>Well,
with that</v>

706
00:40:06.450 --> 00:40:08.870
<v 2>appropriate that we kind of end with a Tory story.
So,</v>

707
00:40:09.470 --> 00:40:10.670
<v 3>okay.
What'd you got?</v>

708
00:40:12.630 --> 00:40:16.530
<v 2>So,
um,
I want to thank you for coming back to Google a second time.</v>

709
00:40:16.560 --> 00:40:21.080
Trekking up from the or down from the city and uh,
everyone crashed us girls.

710
00:40:21.090 --> 00:40:24.420
Fantastic book.
You're going to learn something from it.
It's very personal.

711
00:40:24.421 --> 00:40:27.990
It's emotional.
It's not what you'd expect and highly recommended.

712
00:40:27.991 --> 00:40:31.230
And I actually read the book.
Um,
so hopefully your other,

713
00:40:31.231 --> 00:40:35.000
your other book tour interviews,
you get a mix of people who've read the book.
Um,

714
00:40:35.040 --> 00:40:38.360
so I want to thank you again for coming back to Google.
It's been a pleasure.

715
00:40:38.830 --> 00:40:39.700
<v 0>Thanks for inviting me.</v>

716
00:40:40.370 --> 00:40:45.370
