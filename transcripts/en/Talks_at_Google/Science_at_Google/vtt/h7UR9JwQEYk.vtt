WEBVTT

1
00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:07.290
Uh,
well thank you.

2
00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:12.060
It is a great to be with all of you today.
Luke.

3
00:00:12.061 --> 00:00:13.770
Thanks for introducing me.

4
00:00:13.771 --> 00:00:18.330
And also just inviting me here to be with all of you to those of you I've heard

5
00:00:18.331 --> 00:00:21.270
there are people streaming right now.
Um,

6
00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:23.430
that's what I look like,

7
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:28.110
but I can't give a talk for 45 minutes with myself behind me the whole time.

8
00:00:28.111 --> 00:00:32.220
So apparently when this goes up on Youtube,

9
00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.300
they'll integrate it and people there can watch me and not just the slides,

10
00:00:36.301 --> 00:00:40.090
but if you're streaming you're just going to get the slides and my voice,
uh,

11
00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.490
from here on out.
So I'm,
so I'm a social neuroscientist.

12
00:00:44.491 --> 00:00:49.491
I have been looking at people's brains mostly using a MRI scanners for about 20

13
00:00:50.911 --> 00:00:53.940
years now,
a little longer than 20 years.
Uh,

14
00:00:53.941 --> 00:00:58.650
and at some point around 10,
12 years ago,
I started getting introduced,
uh,

15
00:00:58.651 --> 00:01:02.730
invited to come speak to different sort of business related groups.

16
00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.840
And actually a bunch of the talks were at Oracle early on and other leadership

17
00:01:06.841 --> 00:01:10.080
organizations.
Uh,
and so it got me thinking about,
you know,

18
00:01:10.081 --> 00:01:15.081
what on earth does my work have to say that's relevant to business to thinking

19
00:01:15.541 --> 00:01:19.800
about,
uh,
how the social brain is sort of doing its thing at work.

20
00:01:19.801 --> 00:01:22.590
And so part of what I think about,
um,

21
00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:27.360
is sort of how do we kind of promote wellbeing,
productivity,
happiness,

22
00:01:27.361 --> 00:01:31.950
all these things that you sort of want to see more of at work.
And to do this,

23
00:01:31.951 --> 00:01:34.230
you basically need a good model,

24
00:01:34.231 --> 00:01:38.970
a good theory of what sort of motivates and drives human beings.

25
00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:43.560
Uh,
and so I think that the sort of inherited wisdom we've had for hundreds of

26
00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:43.561
years,

27
00:01:43.561 --> 00:01:47.310
you can't really do much better than Thomas Hobbs who summed it up in a single

28
00:01:47.311 --> 00:01:48.300
sentence.

29
00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:54.980
A man has no other end in all his actions then his private self interest.

30
00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:59.760
Um,
so we get as much good stuff as we can for as little work,

31
00:01:59.761 --> 00:02:04.590
as little pain as possible.
Um,
and if you want to see evidence of this,

32
00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:05.280
um,

33
00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:10.280
one easy way to sort of see this is to go to a game that a economist developed.

34
00:02:10.831 --> 00:02:14.850
I think back in the late eighties,
maybe it was early nineties,
uh,
no,

35
00:02:14.851 --> 00:02:17.490
it was earlier.
It was the 80s called the prisoner's dilemma.

36
00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.240
And I'm sure some of you are familiar with the prisoner's dilemma.

37
00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.880
I won't describe all the,
the details of it.

38
00:02:23.881 --> 00:02:28.830
The key things you need to know is it typically two people are playing with or

39
00:02:28.831 --> 00:02:29.970
against each other.

40
00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:33.570
They never meet each other and they are never going to meet each other.

41
00:02:33.571 --> 00:02:35.910
They typically play one round of the game.

42
00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:39.270
So there's no concern with reputation.
Uh,

43
00:02:39.271 --> 00:02:43.650
and the key thing about the way you play the game is that your outcomes are

44
00:02:43.651 --> 00:02:44.670
interdependent.

45
00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.840
So the way you play affects both your outcomes and the other persons.

46
00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:51.180
And the same is true for them as well.

47
00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.470
And so there's two ways you can play the game.
You can play the game,
uh,

48
00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.980
selfishly where you try to maximize the amount of money you'll take for and it

49
00:02:59.981 --> 00:03:04.900
is definitively going to come at the expense of less money for the other person.

50
00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:10.320
And the other option is to play in a sort of more communal sort of way where you

51
00:03:10.601 --> 00:03:14.140
try to maximize the amount of money that you and the other person are going to

52
00:03:14.141 --> 00:03:15.070
earn jointly.

53
00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:19.210
But that will definitely come at the expense of you getting less money.

54
00:03:19.211 --> 00:03:21.950
Personally.
These are the two options.
Um,

55
00:03:21.951 --> 00:03:24.340
and in line with economists predictions,

56
00:03:24.341 --> 00:03:28.750
the vast majority of people play this game.
Selfishly.
They go and say,

57
00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.550
I'll take the most money for myself.
Thank you very much.
And so games like this,

58
00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:34.001
uh,

59
00:03:34.001 --> 00:03:39.001
give rise to the view of human nature as being something like a homo economic

60
00:03:40.311 --> 00:03:40.870
basis,

61
00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:44.800
something like that where we're basically rationally self interested creatures

62
00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:49.060
where we're fundamentally selfish.
Uh,
we try not to exert too much effort.

63
00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:54.130
We can be reasonably rational in some contexts and we pursue wealth and other

64
00:03:54.131 --> 00:03:56.260
sort of material gains for ourselves.

65
00:03:56.710 --> 00:04:01.180
And that's what's been shown in hundreds and hundreds of iterations of this
game.

66
00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:03.040
Uh,
the prisoner's dilemma,

67
00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:08.280
but there's a version of this game that you are probably not familiar with that

68
00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:10.480
I think it's sort of an interesting contrast.

69
00:04:10.481 --> 00:04:13.900
So actually it's the exact same game.
So in this version of the game,

70
00:04:13.901 --> 00:04:15.340
you have the exact same rules.

71
00:04:15.341 --> 00:04:20.110
Describe to you word for word the same and you play the game exactly the same

72
00:04:20.111 --> 00:04:24.130
way.
But at the start of the game,
when they're introducing the rules,

73
00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:29.340
instead of describing or defining the game one way or another in this particular

74
00:04:30.941 --> 00:04:32.350
version of the game,
they say,

75
00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:35.230
today you're going to be playing the community game.

76
00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:40.570
And then they explain the exact same rules as what is normally taking place in

77
00:04:40.571 --> 00:04:43.150
the prisoner's dilemma.
And when you do this,

78
00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:48.160
the percentage of people who play selfishly drops precipitously and suddenly now

79
00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:52.860
almost everybody,
well three quarters of people suddenly now play communally,

80
00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:55.990
communally and try to sort of do what's best for the group.

81
00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:01.440
And so in addition to suggesting that a human beings are exquisitely sensitive

82
00:05:02.081 --> 00:05:04.720
to context and situational pressures and so on,

83
00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:09.840
what it also may suggest is that we are sort of more than just homo economic us.

84
00:05:10.991 --> 00:05:13.180
We are also homosocial Cialis,
um,

85
00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:17.890
that we may have the sort of intrinsic,
a social concerns.

86
00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:22.240
And that what we're looking for is when we're supposed to demonstrate these

87
00:05:22.241 --> 00:05:25.990
motives.
And when we're supposed to demonstrate those motives.
Okay.

88
00:05:25.991 --> 00:05:28.240
And that we have both of these and we use both.

89
00:05:28.241 --> 00:05:31.570
I'm not trying to suggest we're not selfish creatures.
Uh,
we are,

90
00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:35.170
but we are not only selfish creatures as part of what I'll argue.

91
00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:38.950
So for the time I have with you,
I'm going to try to do three things.

92
00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:43.570
The first thing I'm going to try to do is present to you some of the

93
00:05:43.571 --> 00:05:45.580
neuroscience data that we've collected.

94
00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:50.410
An attempt to sort of prove to you that our ability and our skills at being

95
00:05:50.411 --> 00:05:55.411
social is not just another program we learn like how to play chess or Algebra.

96
00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:59.210
Those are things that we can learn because we have this great prefrontal cortex

97
00:05:59.211 --> 00:06:03.860
that's super flexible and can learn any new sort of rule based kind of thing if

98
00:06:03.861 --> 00:06:06.740
it's useful for us to learn it.
Um,

99
00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:09.010
but instead what I'm going to suggest is,

100
00:06:09.011 --> 00:06:13.430
is that our social operating system is part of the basic components of,

101
00:06:13.431 --> 00:06:16.550
of who we are as mammals.
That all mammals actually share this.

102
00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:21.440
And we have plenty of it as well.
Uh,
if I convince you of that,

103
00:06:21.441 --> 00:06:26.000
hopefully I will,
I'll spend some time then trying to tell you some things about,

104
00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:28.110
uh,
why,
uh,

105
00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:32.630
paying more attention to our social nature is really important for thinking

106
00:06:32.631 --> 00:06:36.710
about a happiness,
wellbeing,
and productivity in the workplace.

107
00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:38.510
And then,
uh,

108
00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:42.860
I assume I will have time cause I set a timer for myself to make sure I'd get to

109
00:06:42.861 --> 00:06:46.650
this last piece.
Cause that's the piece I'm actually most excited about.
Uh,

110
00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:50.750
that's about sort of where our work is going and where it's now really directly

111
00:06:50.751 --> 00:06:55.280
relevant to thinking about neuroscience and social neuroscience specifically in

112
00:06:55.281 --> 00:06:58.250
the workplace and how we can sort of use it there,
uh,

113
00:06:58.251 --> 00:07:01.340
in a way that I think really hasn't been used in the past.

114
00:07:01.341 --> 00:07:05.600
But let's start at the beginning trying to convince you that some of the social

115
00:07:05.601 --> 00:07:10.550
aspects of ourself,
um,
are really,
really sort of a basic part of who we are.

116
00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:15.210
So,
um,
let's start with the concept social pain.
Uh,

117
00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:19.340
so we came up with the concept of social pain back in the early two thousands,

118
00:07:19.341 --> 00:07:23.870
and because we came up with it,
we got to define it.
And so our definition,

119
00:07:23.871 --> 00:07:25.490
there's various ones we've used,

120
00:07:25.491 --> 00:07:29.960
but it's the pain associated with actual or potential threats to one social

121
00:07:29.961 --> 00:07:34.100
connections.
And if we want to be sort of extra wordy,
it can be actual threat,

122
00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:39.230
actual or potential threats to one's actual or potential or imagine social

123
00:07:39.231 --> 00:07:42.620
connections.
So it's,
it's sort of a pretty flexible concept.

124
00:07:43.010 --> 00:07:47.570
But when most people see this definition,
uh,
what you're likely to think is,

125
00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:52.430
oh,
I get it.
So people are bothered when they're socially rejected.

126
00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:55.400
So you're using social pain,
but that's just a metaphor.

127
00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:58.940
Social pain is metaphorical language.
It's poetic license.

128
00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:02.420
And so what I want to take a few minutes to do is to think about what it would

129
00:08:02.421 --> 00:08:07.421
take to persuade you that social pain is every bit as much of a real kind of

130
00:08:07.611 --> 00:08:12.110
pain as a when you stub your toe or when you have a headache.

131
00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:15.710
That from the brain's perspective and from an evolutionary perspective,

132
00:08:15.890 --> 00:08:19.190
social pain is very much a real kind of pain.

133
00:08:19.191 --> 00:08:20.990
It just manifests in a slightly different way.

134
00:08:20.991 --> 00:08:25.910
But all physical pains manifest in different ways.
So,

135
00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:27.050
um,
you know,

136
00:08:27.051 --> 00:08:32.051
the first thing that's worth noting is that while this may be a metaphor for

137
00:08:32.691 --> 00:08:34.370
social pain and in English,

138
00:08:34.371 --> 00:08:38.420
we use language like you hurt my feelings and she broke my heart.

139
00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:42.410
So we use the language of physical pain to talk about social pain.

140
00:08:42.770 --> 00:08:45.130
And it turns out it's not just an English.
Uh,

141
00:08:45.170 --> 00:08:48.410
there was a paper published years ago,
not by my group,
uh,

142
00:08:48.620 --> 00:08:50.570
showing that in languages all around the world,

143
00:08:50.571 --> 00:08:53.180
including lots of non romance languages.

144
00:08:53.390 --> 00:08:58.390
The language of social pain is based in the language of physical pain,

145
00:08:58.770 --> 00:09:02.100
at least I assume it is.
I,
I,
every once in a while now when I get up here,

146
00:09:02.101 --> 00:09:04.650
I realize I can't translate most of these,

147
00:09:04.651 --> 00:09:07.610
but I assume the authors who wrote this paper could,
and,
uh,

148
00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:11.250
someone would have made them retract the paper by this point if they were

149
00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:14.240
inaccurate in their translations.
Uh,

150
00:09:14.350 --> 00:09:18.180
so we are neuroimaging folks where neuroscientists,

151
00:09:18.181 --> 00:09:21.900
and so our approach is not to look at how the language is common around the

152
00:09:21.901 --> 00:09:24.270
world,
although I think that's super interesting.
Uh,

153
00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:28.350
but instead we tend to put people in these giant coffin like donuts,

154
00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:31.230
um,
where you hear really loud noises.

155
00:09:31.231 --> 00:09:34.260
It's not a terribly pleasant place to be unless you're me.

156
00:09:34.261 --> 00:09:37.770
I tend to fall asleep and scanners when people put me in.
Um,

157
00:09:37.771 --> 00:09:40.500
it's a little bit like being in the womb or it's terrible.

158
00:09:40.501 --> 00:09:44.130
It's one or the other for most people.
And we bring folks in,

159
00:09:44.131 --> 00:09:47.220
and this was back in 2001,
2002,

160
00:09:47.221 --> 00:09:51.660
we brought folks in and we had them play this silly little ball tossing game

161
00:09:51.661 --> 00:09:54.840
called cyberball.
And in Cyberball,
uh,

162
00:09:54.930 --> 00:09:58.200
you're controlling this hand at the bottom of your,
the subject in our scanner.

163
00:09:58.201 --> 00:10:01.710
You're controlling this hand and you believe you're playing with two other real

164
00:10:01.711 --> 00:10:06.540
people over the Internet who are also laying in scanners.
Right now,
of course,

165
00:10:06.541 --> 00:10:07.800
we are social psychologists,

166
00:10:07.801 --> 00:10:11.280
so we lie to people all the time about what they're doing in the studies.

167
00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:16.290
And after a few minutes the game changes and some of you may now start to be

168
00:10:16.291 --> 00:10:18.700
able to realize how the game changes.
Uh,

169
00:10:18.750 --> 00:10:23.490
the other two people who are really just a code,
they're not people at all.

170
00:10:23.670 --> 00:10:23.910
Uh,

171
00:10:23.910 --> 00:10:28.770
they stopped throwing the ball to the real subject and this goes on for a few

172
00:10:28.770 --> 00:10:28.920
minutes.

173
00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:32.760
Subjects get out of the scanner and they're usually either kind of depressed or

174
00:10:32.761 --> 00:10:37.260
angry,
but they definitely tend to have a significant emotional response to this.

175
00:10:37.770 --> 00:10:42.330
And so what we were interested in is what was happening in the brain while

176
00:10:42.331 --> 00:10:47.331
people were being rejected or a excluded from the game compared to the earlier

177
00:10:47.401 --> 00:10:49.320
period when they had been included.

178
00:10:49.830 --> 00:10:53.580
These are the brain regions associated with the distress of physical pain.
Okay.

179
00:10:53.581 --> 00:10:58.380
So the more bothered you are by any painful experience that you have,

180
00:10:58.530 --> 00:11:01.590
the more activity you're going to see in these two regions.

181
00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:05.820
And when we looked in the brain at what was different between the people's

182
00:11:05.821 --> 00:11:09.540
responses when they were being excluded compared to when they were included,

183
00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:13.080
these were the only two regions of the brain that were more active during

184
00:11:13.081 --> 00:11:16.710
rejection than when folks were included.
Moreover,

185
00:11:16.711 --> 00:11:17.940
when people got out of the scanner,

186
00:11:17.941 --> 00:11:22.800
we asked them to tell us how painful it was to be rejected while they were

187
00:11:22.801 --> 00:11:24.840
playing this very boring game.

188
00:11:25.410 --> 00:11:28.950
And the more they told us they felt that it was a painful experience,

189
00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:32.970
the more these two regions showed increasing responses.

190
00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:38.100
And so this persuades,
I'm a fair number of people that,
um,

191
00:11:38.130 --> 00:11:41.400
social pain is a real kind of pain,
but if it doesn't persuade you,

192
00:11:41.890 --> 00:11:46.780
perhaps the followup study will,
it turns out that if you give people Tylenol,

193
00:11:46.781 --> 00:11:49.020
all these effects go away.
Okay.

194
00:11:49.021 --> 00:11:53.070
So the same painkiller that you take for your headaches actually works.

195
00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:57.040
Some sense for your heartaches,
for your sense of being rejected or excluded.

196
00:11:57.220 --> 00:12:01.030
It works for that as well.
Uh,
important caveat here,

197
00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:04.540
do not try this at home.
Tylenol is super toxic.

198
00:12:04.541 --> 00:12:08.080
500 people a year die from Tylenol overdoses.
Um,

199
00:12:08.081 --> 00:12:11.560
and so while there are clinical trials going on and we did this,

200
00:12:11.770 --> 00:12:15.490
this was done in a very sort of proper appropriate lab based way,

201
00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:20.290
don't do this at home.
Okay.
Um,
there I told you not to.
If you do,

202
00:12:20.291 --> 00:12:24.540
that's on you now.
All right.
Um,
so you know,
we,

203
00:12:24.541 --> 00:12:29.541
we have this I think very basic inborn sensitivity to social rejection that

204
00:12:29.801 --> 00:12:33.640
manifests itself in the form of pain.
And it turns out it's not just humans.

205
00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:38.860
All mammals show this kind of response and they tend to show it in the same

206
00:12:38.861 --> 00:12:42.850
regions of the brain.
So you can look at rats,
you can look at monkeys,

207
00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:44.950
there are other animals that have been looked at as well,

208
00:12:44.951 --> 00:12:47.350
and they tend to show this same response.

209
00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:51.940
We have it because for humans who are born incapable of taking care of

210
00:12:51.941 --> 00:12:55.330
themselves when they're infants,
you need a way to stay connected.

211
00:12:55.480 --> 00:13:00.480
And this makes the infant and the caregiver feel connected and are very

212
00:13:00.731 --> 00:13:02.710
sensitive to distress.
In the other,

213
00:13:02.711 --> 00:13:06.460
especially the caregiver is very sensitive to the social pain,

214
00:13:06.461 --> 00:13:10.060
distress calls given by the infants of pretty much any mammals.

215
00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:14.140
And so the upshot of this is it social pain is one of the things that motivates

216
00:13:14.141 --> 00:13:16.450
us to stay connected,
to stay together.

217
00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:21.010
And that allows us to do all sorts of extraordinary things like build buildings

218
00:13:21.011 --> 00:13:23.740
with air conditioning and roofs and things like that.

219
00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:27.430
That pretty much if you were on your own and weren't feeling any motivation to

220
00:13:27.431 --> 00:13:31.840
connect with other people,
we might never have developed these sorts of things.

221
00:13:32.380 --> 00:13:36.220
Now on the flip side of social pain,
we have social pleasures,

222
00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:39.640
which are a nicer to think about and talk about and so on.
Uh,

223
00:13:39.641 --> 00:13:44.641
and it turns out that the same pretty primitive brain system that we share with

224
00:13:45.071 --> 00:13:49.550
reptiles and most other animals that can walk,
um,

225
00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:53.580
the ventral striatum,
the region shown in fire here.
Um,

226
00:13:53.770 --> 00:13:57.700
this is a region that we've known for years and years responds when people in

227
00:13:57.701 --> 00:14:00.300
the scanner a win money,
uh,

228
00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:04.330
when they get to eat something that's delicious when they look at pictures of

229
00:14:04.331 --> 00:14:07.990
pretty people.
Right?
All those things activate this system,

230
00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:12.790
but it also turns out we've known for a few years now that being liked,
loved,

231
00:14:12.791 --> 00:14:13.391
respected,

232
00:14:13.391 --> 00:14:18.391
or even just feeling understood are all things that activate this same system.

233
00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:23.830
Okay.
Um,
so this is a system that seems to be just as sensitive.

234
00:14:23.831 --> 00:14:27.160
Some evidence suggests it's more sensitive to social rewards.

235
00:14:27.310 --> 00:14:31.240
Then these other kinds of rewards that we sort of tend to think of when we think

236
00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:34.140
of rewards in general.
All right.

237
00:14:34.930 --> 00:14:36.550
It's better to give than to receive.

238
00:14:36.580 --> 00:14:39.010
You've all heard this presumably at some point.

239
00:14:39.190 --> 00:14:42.640
Usually it's associated with someone getting a pretty bad gift,
uh,

240
00:14:42.641 --> 00:14:45.640
around Christmas or Hanukkah.
Um,

241
00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:49.330
does anyone know who first said it's better to give than to receive?

242
00:14:50.350 --> 00:14:51.560
I'll tell you,
your brain,

243
00:14:51.710 --> 00:14:56.210
your brain for a said this because all humans are built with this wired in.

244
00:14:56.211 --> 00:14:58.250
Remember we started with the prisoner's dilemma,

245
00:14:58.690 --> 00:15:03.080
a where you can decide to play selfishly or for the group and if you have any

246
00:15:03.081 --> 00:15:04.640
strong views that you know,

247
00:15:04.641 --> 00:15:09.080
we are rationally self interest going for the money kinds of creatures.

248
00:15:09.230 --> 00:15:13.100
You might imagine that there'd be social norms suggesting that there are times

249
00:15:13.101 --> 00:15:16.700
when we think we're supposed to give money to the group to work communally.

250
00:15:16.850 --> 00:15:21.230
You could say that community condition was just people being sensitive to norms

251
00:15:21.231 --> 00:15:25.760
and being afraid of what the experimenter would think.
But if that's the case,

252
00:15:25.910 --> 00:15:30.910
you would still expect that the brain's reward system to respond most strongly

253
00:15:31.041 --> 00:15:33.800
when people chose to play the game in the way,

254
00:15:33.801 --> 00:15:37.520
that would by definition maximize their own earnings.

255
00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:41.030
But that is not what happens in the prisoner's dilemma and the prisoner's

256
00:15:41.031 --> 00:15:41.660
dilemma.

257
00:15:41.660 --> 00:15:46.490
You get the most activity in the ventral striatum when you play communally.
Okay?

258
00:15:46.491 --> 00:15:49.460
So this is a case does a different kind of social reward.

259
00:15:49.461 --> 00:15:52.820
The first kind I told you about is when people tell you they like love,

260
00:15:52.821 --> 00:15:57.530
respect you.
This kind of social reward is when you do for others.

261
00:15:57.740 --> 00:16:02.740
And it turns out that were built such that doing for others is also a rewarding,

262
00:16:02.930 --> 00:16:07.100
pleasurable experience.
One that we don't always have a very good theory of,

263
00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:10.190
but it definitely is true.
Uh,

264
00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:15.060
Adam Grant who's at the Wharton School in Pennsylvania.
You pen,
um,

265
00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:19.880
he wrote a wonderful book on the benefits of sort of being a giver at work

266
00:16:19.881 --> 00:16:22.580
instead of a taker.
If a,

267
00:16:22.581 --> 00:16:27.260
if you are going to buy one book this year,
well by mine,

268
00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:31.160
uh,
but if you're going to buy two I would highly,

269
00:16:31.161 --> 00:16:33.200
highly recommend his book.

270
00:16:33.540 --> 00:16:36.800
And one of the things he found in this book is that if you go take folks who are

271
00:16:36.801 --> 00:16:39.320
doing relatively menial thankless work,

272
00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:43.010
like working a phone bank trying to raise money for scholarships for the

273
00:16:43.011 --> 00:16:46.670
university where everybody is hanging up and trying to get off the phone with

274
00:16:46.671 --> 00:16:50.900
you and you bring someone in who won one of their scholarships that they're

275
00:16:50.901 --> 00:16:51.950
raising money for,

276
00:16:52.070 --> 00:16:57.070
who then tells some of these phone bank folks about how the work they're doing

277
00:16:57.380 --> 00:16:59.450
actually tangibly benefit someone.

278
00:17:00.060 --> 00:17:04.010
The productivity of these folks goes through the roof.

279
00:17:04.370 --> 00:17:05.510
And when I say it goes to the roof,

280
00:17:05.511 --> 00:17:08.660
I don't mean that day or the next day where you would expect them to be like,

281
00:17:08.690 --> 00:17:09.620
oh that was so great.

282
00:17:09.621 --> 00:17:13.580
That was fun that we heard from that 20 year old telling us what this award

283
00:17:13.581 --> 00:17:14.414
meant for them.

284
00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:17.990
It's a month later that they come back and measure and a month later the

285
00:17:17.991 --> 00:17:21.650
productivity of the folks who got this intervention is dramatically higher.

286
00:17:21.651 --> 00:17:24.290
And this has been replicated several times in different contexts.

287
00:17:24.291 --> 00:17:25.850
So I think it's really legit.

288
00:17:27.080 --> 00:17:31.160
So humans are sensitive to social pain,
social pleasure.

289
00:17:31.310 --> 00:17:34.400
You would think that if these are things that can really move around our

290
00:17:34.401 --> 00:17:35.234
wellbeing,

291
00:17:35.330 --> 00:17:40.040
we might have a system in our brain that helps us navigate the social world so

292
00:17:40.041 --> 00:17:44.510
that we can maximize our social pleasures and minimize the social pains.
Uh,

293
00:17:44.511 --> 00:17:49.511
for some time people thought that it was the sort of basic analytical in the

294
00:17:49.591 --> 00:17:54.330
brain,
which is shown here in Green,
um,
loosely shown here in Green.

295
00:17:54.510 --> 00:17:58.530
These are systems that are involved in math and logical reasoning and accounting

296
00:17:58.531 --> 00:18:02.280
and working memory,
holding things temporarily in mind.
Uh,

297
00:18:02.310 --> 00:18:06.630
but it turns out that there really is a completely separate network that's

298
00:18:06.631 --> 00:18:11.370
involved in our social thinking that doesn't really overlap with the network for

299
00:18:11.371 --> 00:18:13.260
analytical thinking at all.

300
00:18:13.350 --> 00:18:15.930
And we've learned some interesting things about this network.

301
00:18:15.931 --> 00:18:18.690
One of the things we've learned is that these two networks,

302
00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:22.470
the social thinking and analytical thinking networks kind of operate like a

303
00:18:22.471 --> 00:18:22.841
neuro.

304
00:18:22.841 --> 00:18:27.841
See Saul where activity in one going up tends to be associated with activity and

305
00:18:28.351 --> 00:18:30.450
the other going down and vice versa.

306
00:18:30.780 --> 00:18:34.860
They seem to trade off of each other and we can think immediately about how that

307
00:18:34.861 --> 00:18:38.940
might be relevant in the workplace.
Right?
I mean,
I assume Google,

308
00:18:38.941 --> 00:18:42.970
like most companies really prioritizes people being highly analytical.

309
00:18:42.971 --> 00:18:46.530
He skilled many,
many hours of the day.
Uh,

310
00:18:46.531 --> 00:18:51.531
and the goal is to just sort of emphasize that without necessarily detracting

311
00:18:51.751 --> 00:18:54.660
from other sorts of capacities that we might have.

312
00:18:54.870 --> 00:18:57.540
But there's some evidence to suggest that if you're putting the pedal to the

313
00:18:57.541 --> 00:18:59.010
metal on the analytical side,

314
00:18:59.190 --> 00:19:04.190
that may come at a real cost of actually dampening down some of our,

315
00:19:04.660 --> 00:19:04.890
uh,

316
00:19:04.890 --> 00:19:09.570
social skills and our ability to detect certain things socially in others in our

317
00:19:09.571 --> 00:19:14.120
social environment.
Um,
another thing we've learned is sort of a,

318
00:19:14.121 --> 00:19:16.830
a funny result and a,
and I'll show it to you this way.

319
00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:20.100
So let's say I brought you into my scanner.
It's not my scanner,

320
00:19:20.101 --> 00:19:23.010
it's UCLA scanner.
I brought you in and a,

321
00:19:23.011 --> 00:19:26.160
I told you that what you're going to do is lay in the scanner and you're going

322
00:19:26.161 --> 00:19:29.490
to do math for a minute and then you're going to lay there and rest and do

323
00:19:29.491 --> 00:19:32.820
nothing for a minute and then math for a minute and rest and the math is super

324
00:19:32.821 --> 00:19:37.380
easy.
It's like three plus four type math and the rest is nothing.
And this time,

325
00:19:37.410 --> 00:19:39.720
even though I'm a social psychologist,
I'm not lying to you.

326
00:19:39.721 --> 00:19:42.420
This is exactly what you do while you're laying in the scanner.

327
00:19:42.780 --> 00:19:47.010
And so we can go look at these analytical parts of the brain and they will do

328
00:19:47.011 --> 00:19:49.980
just what we would expect them to do.
They'll do something like this.

329
00:19:49.981 --> 00:19:53.160
This is idealized,
but something like this,
when you're doing math,

330
00:19:53.161 --> 00:19:57.630
the analytical parts light up and when you're resting they quiet down because

331
00:19:57.631 --> 00:20:01.350
you don't need them to rest and do nothing while you're laying in the scanner.

332
00:20:01.890 --> 00:20:05.970
Now we can look at the same exact task and what's happening in the social brain,

333
00:20:06.030 --> 00:20:10.470
in the social thinking network.
Well,
what we would expect to see is this,

334
00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:14.910
not much at all,
right?
Cause you don't need your social brain to do math.
In fact,

335
00:20:14.911 --> 00:20:17.010
if you activate your social brain while you're doing math,

336
00:20:17.011 --> 00:20:21.030
it interferes and you don't need your social brain during rest,
right?

337
00:20:21.060 --> 00:20:25.950
So that's what we'd expect to see.
But what you actually see is this.
Okay?
So,

338
00:20:25.980 --> 00:20:29.430
uh,
the social brain comes on incredibly reliably.

339
00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:34.110
Anytime there's a break in the action and it comes on within a few hundred

340
00:20:34.111 --> 00:20:38.700
milliseconds of finishing any sort of cognitive goal directed task.

341
00:20:38.850 --> 00:20:41.130
So there are folks who have done things with depth electrodes.

342
00:20:41.131 --> 00:20:44.610
They put them right in the right positions and they can tell within 300

343
00:20:44.611 --> 00:20:45.361
milliseconds,

344
00:20:45.361 --> 00:20:49.090
it's actually a guy at Stanford nearby that within 300 milliseconds,

345
00:20:49.210 --> 00:20:54.040
the social brain pops back on.
Okay.
Whenever there's a break in the action.

346
00:20:54.041 --> 00:20:57.130
And so we can ask ourselves,
well,
why would that happen?

347
00:20:57.700 --> 00:21:02.650
And while I'm not going to um,
spend lots of time in my lab,
sorry,

348
00:21:02.651 --> 00:21:07.540
in my lecture today going over why that happens.
Um,

349
00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:12.940
what I can tell you is that the summary result from our studies is it to the

350
00:21:12.941 --> 00:21:17.590
extent that you spontaneously activate this network in short periods of

351
00:21:17.591 --> 00:21:21.550
downtime,
in between sort of more significant events in your life.

352
00:21:21.910 --> 00:21:25.720
If the next thing you have to do involves social thinking,

353
00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:28.150
you're better prepared for it.
Okay.

354
00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:32.410
You actually perform better on social tasks where you have to think about what's

355
00:21:32.411 --> 00:21:36.520
going on in the minds of other folks to the extent that this network has

356
00:21:36.521 --> 00:21:38.740
spontaneously activated itself.

357
00:21:38.980 --> 00:21:42.940
And what that suggests is that evolution is essentially made a bet that the best

358
00:21:42.941 --> 00:21:47.941
thing to do with our spare cycles in our brain as we have downtime is to get

359
00:21:49.331 --> 00:21:51.190
ready for thinking socially.

360
00:21:51.191 --> 00:21:55.480
That that is really evolutionarily significant because this is pretty much the

361
00:21:55.481 --> 00:21:58.990
only thing in the brain that has this sort of pattern where every time there's a

362
00:21:58.991 --> 00:22:03.040
break and we can reset,
it resets towards the social domain.

363
00:22:03.220 --> 00:22:07.180
We actually have a lot of data that speaks to that now.
Um,
and so in essence,

364
00:22:07.181 --> 00:22:10.420
what that does for us,
and I think this is really,
really important,

365
00:22:10.770 --> 00:22:13.000
is that when we look out into the world,

366
00:22:13.150 --> 00:22:17.680
we could see all of this just as physical objects in,
you know,

367
00:22:17.681 --> 00:22:19.330
in physical motion,
right?

368
00:22:19.330 --> 00:22:22.510
We could describe it all in terms of physics and mechanics and so on.

369
00:22:22.810 --> 00:22:26.110
But most people,
the vast majority of people when they look at this,

370
00:22:26.111 --> 00:22:30.640
what they see as psychological meaning they see people having thoughts,
feelings,

371
00:22:30.641 --> 00:22:33.090
interactions,
intentions,
um,

372
00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:38.280
and this tendency to turn on this network as we walk into each new experience is

373
00:22:39.161 --> 00:22:43.960
something that sort of prepares us to see the world in a psychological fashion

374
00:22:44.110 --> 00:22:48.610
rather than in sort of a physics based mechanical fashion.
Um,

375
00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:53.400
so that's a very sort of short course on sort of some of the evidence to

376
00:22:53.401 --> 00:22:58.401
suggests that we really do have some basic social features to us and that we are

377
00:22:58.841 --> 00:23:03.670
not purely self interested.
We are not just a homo economic us.
We are that.

378
00:23:03.671 --> 00:23:04.840
But not just that.

379
00:23:05.270 --> 00:23:09.850
Of course I could have skipped those 20 minutes and just showed you the quote

380
00:23:09.851 --> 00:23:11.500
from Albert Einstein where he says,

381
00:23:11.501 --> 00:23:14.470
man owes his strength and the struggle for existence to the fact that he is a

382
00:23:14.471 --> 00:23:17.860
social animal.
Um,
but you know,

383
00:23:18.010 --> 00:23:20.170
then I would have no job being here at all.

384
00:23:20.171 --> 00:23:21.520
I could've just showed you that slide.

385
00:23:21.970 --> 00:23:26.500
So I'm gonna spend a few minutes telling you now about how some of these things

386
00:23:26.501 --> 00:23:31.501
relate to a business directly and then I'm going to turn to what we're doing now

387
00:23:32.410 --> 00:23:33.910
with a different kind of neuroscience.

388
00:23:33.911 --> 00:23:38.020
It's more work relevant and I'm pretty excited to get to that.
Okay.

389
00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:40.780
So in any workplace,
in any business,

390
00:23:40.781 --> 00:23:44.950
you're a off trying to hire folks and it's been a long time now that we've

391
00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:49.670
understood that the goal of hiring folks is to accrue the most talent,
right?

392
00:23:49.671 --> 00:23:54.671
So any HR department is out there trying to sort of find the individuals who are

393
00:23:54.921 --> 00:23:56.060
a plus people.

394
00:23:56.120 --> 00:24:00.380
And the a plus people are the people with the highest Iq is the most training

395
00:24:00.381 --> 00:24:04.460
and experience who went to the best schools and norms about these things change

396
00:24:04.461 --> 00:24:07.760
over time.
But that's roughly speaking,
describing what's happened over the last,

397
00:24:07.970 --> 00:24:11.570
you know,
couple of decades in terms of how we try to acquire people.

398
00:24:11.750 --> 00:24:15.710
And the goal is to make sure then that your company has the most human capital.

399
00:24:15.950 --> 00:24:19.520
Um,
so almost almost like a sort of role playing game where you're trying to get

400
00:24:19.521 --> 00:24:24.080
people with the most sort of intellectual and academic skills for performing the

401
00:24:24.081 --> 00:24:26.090
feeds they will need to do at work.

402
00:24:26.420 --> 00:24:31.220
Some economists looked at this and discovered that if you want to see the

403
00:24:31.221 --> 00:24:35.120
relationship between human capital and the company's bottom line,

404
00:24:35.300 --> 00:24:40.300
the vast majority of that relationship is actually explained by the links

405
00:24:40.881 --> 00:24:43.850
between the individuals in the company.
Um,

406
00:24:43.851 --> 00:24:47.510
and so here what we're talking about is not human capital but social capital,

407
00:24:47.690 --> 00:24:52.690
the extent to which a company makes the boundaries between people and sections

408
00:24:52.851 --> 00:24:56.480
of the company permeable so that they can connect easily with each other.

409
00:24:56.690 --> 00:24:58.430
And what's critical about this is,
you know,

410
00:24:58.431 --> 00:25:02.360
you've got this a plus person down here with some special set of skills and if

411
00:25:02.361 --> 00:25:05.300
they're siloed and they don't feel really connected to other folks,

412
00:25:05.510 --> 00:25:09.410
will that person up there is never going to benefit from their skills when they

413
00:25:09.411 --> 00:25:10.550
could and vice versa.

414
00:25:10.551 --> 00:25:14.540
This person is not going to easily seek them out because they don't have an easy

415
00:25:14.541 --> 00:25:16.970
path to get access to them.
Okay.

416
00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:21.350
So it's important to build this kind of social capital purely for economic

417
00:25:21.351 --> 00:25:25.670
reasons,
uh,
at companies.
Here's another version of have something similar.

418
00:25:25.910 --> 00:25:26.660
So a,

419
00:25:26.660 --> 00:25:31.660
this is sort of a phone bank company I think in Germany and the company humanize

420
00:25:31.761 --> 00:25:34.760
who does sort of the badge testing where it tracks,
you know,

421
00:25:34.761 --> 00:25:37.970
your every movement throughout the day.
They did a study,
uh,

422
00:25:38.030 --> 00:25:42.410
with this company and the way the company was working when they showed up is

423
00:25:42.411 --> 00:25:46.460
that there'd be five or six people in a phone bank that we're in a pod together

424
00:25:46.700 --> 00:25:50.360
and they would get their 15 minute breaks staggered so that they all took their

425
00:25:50.361 --> 00:25:54.140
breaks at different times and humanized came in and said,
hey,

426
00:25:54.141 --> 00:25:56.330
why don't you give them their breaks together?

427
00:25:56.570 --> 00:25:58.520
Because if you give them their breaks together,

428
00:25:58.730 --> 00:26:02.120
they'll actually be more socially connected to one another and actually feel

429
00:26:02.121 --> 00:26:06.410
like they're on a team.
Now,
this seems like a really small difference,

430
00:26:07.460 --> 00:26:11.180
but it turned out that this difference had really significant effects on the

431
00:26:11.181 --> 00:26:14.900
extent to which people at the company felt cohesive with the other people they

432
00:26:14.901 --> 00:26:18.770
worked with,
the productivity they had,
the stress levels they had.

433
00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:23.480
So these simple changes where they're being sensitive to enhancing the social

434
00:26:23.481 --> 00:26:26.180
dynamics of the group had really substantial effects.

435
00:26:26.181 --> 00:26:28.100
And they've done other studies like this as well,
and,

436
00:26:28.101 --> 00:26:33.101
and tend to see something if nobody is focusing on the social aspects of a

437
00:26:33.561 --> 00:26:37.250
company that becomes low hanging fruit because nobody's actually gone after the

438
00:26:37.251 --> 00:26:41.570
low hanging fruit before.
And this is,
I think that sort of thing.
Uh,

439
00:26:41.571 --> 00:26:43.890
we can think about performance feedback,
right?

440
00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:46.380
Everybody gets performance feedback at most companies.

441
00:26:46.380 --> 00:26:48.270
There's a few companies that have done away with it.

442
00:26:48.390 --> 00:26:52.020
It's hard to do away with it.
You want your employees to get feedback,

443
00:26:52.260 --> 00:26:56.970
but nobody likes getting performance feedback.
Uh,
and so for me,

444
00:26:56.971 --> 00:27:00.210
one of the things I always think about when I think about performance feedback

445
00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:02.610
is that for the person giving the feedback,

446
00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:06.150
they're just giving constructive advice for how you can go be more efficient and

447
00:27:06.151 --> 00:27:08.730
effective.
And for the person receiving the feedback,

448
00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:12.450
it's like somebody punching you in the face typically,
unless you're,
you know,

449
00:27:12.451 --> 00:27:15.330
the golden child of,
of whatever company you're working at.

450
00:27:15.690 --> 00:27:17.580
And so we have a way of understanding that,
right?

451
00:27:17.581 --> 00:27:21.030
So we've talked about social pain.
And the idea is,

452
00:27:21.031 --> 00:27:25.860
is that if we think of this as a genuinely painful event for people to be told,

453
00:27:25.890 --> 00:27:30.000
information that may make you feel less valued and worthy at the company that

454
00:27:30.001 --> 00:27:30.870
you're working at,

455
00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:34.530
then it's weird to think that those folks should be able to just go back to work

456
00:27:34.531 --> 00:27:35.364
and be effective.

457
00:27:35.550 --> 00:27:39.750
We wouldn't expect someone to break their leg and then go back to work.
We'd say,

458
00:27:39.751 --> 00:27:43.470
go take that,
get that taken care of and come back to work when you know,

459
00:27:43.471 --> 00:27:46.830
it's all,
you know,
in a cast and,
and feeling better.

460
00:27:47.250 --> 00:27:51.660
There's work that shows that after people have been rejected,

461
00:27:52.770 --> 00:27:53.280
um,

462
00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:57.630
their iqs go down significantly and their performance on standardized tests like

463
00:27:57.631 --> 00:28:01.800
the gres plummet,
right?
68%.
Right?

464
00:28:01.801 --> 00:28:04.320
If you've just been accepted and made to feel good,

465
00:28:04.410 --> 00:28:07.950
39% if you've just been rejected.
Okay.

466
00:28:08.100 --> 00:28:12.630
So after you've just been rejected,
don't go take the Gres.
You will not do well.

467
00:28:12.660 --> 00:28:16.160
Okay?
It's not a good solution.
Eat some ice cream.
Uh,

468
00:28:16.590 --> 00:28:21.420
we can think more directly about happiness and sort of how to promote that.

469
00:28:21.770 --> 00:28:26.630
Uh,
we know,
of course that,
uh,
two of the major factors that drive happiness are,

470
00:28:26.900 --> 00:28:31.010
uh,
money and health.
Uh,
so let's start with health.
Uh,

471
00:28:31.020 --> 00:28:33.360
so we all know smoking's bad for you,
right?
In California,

472
00:28:33.361 --> 00:28:35.940
almost nobody ever smokes anymore.
But like in most of the world,

473
00:28:35.941 --> 00:28:37.780
lots of people still smoke.
Um,

474
00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:41.820
you can look at the morbidity statistics,
uh,

475
00:28:42.010 --> 00:28:46.760
for your likelihood of essentially dying from different kinds of behaviors,
uh,

476
00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:49.920
from like not being physically active,
being obese,

477
00:28:49.950 --> 00:28:54.240
having pneumonia and smoking is like the worst one from,
uh,

478
00:28:54.300 --> 00:28:58.590
behaviors that you can personally engage in.
Okay.
Smoking's really,
really bad.

479
00:28:58.740 --> 00:29:01.470
And that's one of the reasons we spend about a half billion dollars a year in

480
00:29:01.471 --> 00:29:06.090
the United States to stop people from smoking and to get people to stop smoking

481
00:29:06.091 --> 00:29:09.420
once they have started.
But what I haven't shown you here,

482
00:29:09.421 --> 00:29:11.730
which is the most interesting part of the chart,

483
00:29:12.120 --> 00:29:17.120
is that it actually turns out that not cultivating a meaningful social group is

484
00:29:17.491 --> 00:29:22.470
actually more dangerous to your health than smoking 15 cigarettes a day.
Um,

485
00:29:22.471 --> 00:29:26.310
so,
um,
while health is super important for your wellbeing,

486
00:29:26.490 --> 00:29:30.840
turns out that being socially connected is also super important for your

487
00:29:30.841 --> 00:29:32.760
wellbeing.
Um,

488
00:29:34.380 --> 00:29:36.540
we know people value being wealthy.

489
00:29:36.630 --> 00:29:40.770
We know people value material wealth than percentage of people who value it has

490
00:29:40.771 --> 00:29:45.040
gone up and up in the United States.
Um,
and I value it too.

491
00:29:45.041 --> 00:29:48.960
So I'm not really sort of throwing stones at all.
But what I will say is,

492
00:29:48.961 --> 00:29:52.600
is that this seems largely to be a mistake because as wealth rises,

493
00:29:52.601 --> 00:29:55.120
happiness typically doesn't change at all.

494
00:29:55.121 --> 00:29:58.720
And you can cut the data a million different ways unless you're moving people

495
00:29:58.721 --> 00:30:02.020
from genuine poverty too out of poverty,

496
00:30:02.021 --> 00:30:05.380
then every dollar really does change happiness and wellbeing.

497
00:30:05.590 --> 00:30:07.360
But once you hit a certain threshold,

498
00:30:07.390 --> 00:30:10.270
you get very diminishing returns for increasing money.

499
00:30:10.690 --> 00:30:12.640
So what makes people happier?
Well,

500
00:30:12.641 --> 00:30:16.120
the people who report being very happy are the people who spend lots of time

501
00:30:16.121 --> 00:30:21.070
with friends and family.
Have some economists looked at this,
uh,

502
00:30:21.340 --> 00:30:26.260
using money as a sort of comparison point and they said,

503
00:30:26.261 --> 00:30:26.800
okay,

504
00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:31.300
how much does spending an extra hour a week with someone you really like going

505
00:30:31.301 --> 00:30:33.280
to get coffee with them or something like that.

506
00:30:33.460 --> 00:30:37.090
How much does that increase your happiness?
And they put it in terms of money.

507
00:30:37.210 --> 00:30:37.541
They said,

508
00:30:37.541 --> 00:30:42.460
how much money would you have to make extra in a given year in order to get the

509
00:30:42.461 --> 00:30:46.960
same amount of happiness you get from spending an hour a week with a good
friend?

510
00:30:47.080 --> 00:30:49.900
Okay.
Turns out it's a giant amount of money.

511
00:30:50.140 --> 00:30:53.560
You have to make an extra hundred thousand dollars a year to get the same

512
00:30:53.561 --> 00:30:56.530
increase in your happiness and spending an hour with someone you like.

513
00:30:56.680 --> 00:30:59.500
You get to pick the person you're talking about here,
someone you like.

514
00:30:59.830 --> 00:31:04.180
Which of these is more fun working to make an extra hundred grand or spending

515
00:31:04.181 --> 00:31:09.010
time with a friend.
And as we do this,
we have less time to do this,
right?

516
00:31:09.011 --> 00:31:10.330
These are the choices we all make.

517
00:31:10.331 --> 00:31:14.020
We moved cross country for job opportunities and leave our social networks

518
00:31:14.021 --> 00:31:18.730
behind.
Um,
we can think about this within the workplace specifically,

519
00:31:18.731 --> 00:31:22.060
not just having friends in life,
but having friends at work.

520
00:31:22.390 --> 00:31:24.640
It turns out that wall,

521
00:31:24.760 --> 00:31:29.410
people who love the company they work at often say it's because they love the

522
00:31:29.411 --> 00:31:31.870
interesting and challenging work they do there.
Uh,

523
00:31:31.900 --> 00:31:35.740
they also often say their number one reason for loving the company they work at

524
00:31:35.860 --> 00:31:40.600
is the coworkers that they get to work with.
And people who say,

525
00:31:40.601 --> 00:31:44.470
I have a best friend at work.
Um,
people who answer yes to this,

526
00:31:44.471 --> 00:31:47.400
the divisions of companies they work in,
okay.

527
00:31:47.590 --> 00:31:51.290
Tend to have customers who are happier,
they're more productive and uh,

528
00:31:51.370 --> 00:31:54.490
they show greater profit.
Um,

529
00:31:54.850 --> 00:31:57.400
so the upshot of this,

530
00:31:57.401 --> 00:32:02.401
and then I'm going to turn to my last piece is that in the workplace we tend to

531
00:32:02.891 --> 00:32:07.080
think that this is the primary way to incentivize people.
Um,

532
00:32:07.240 --> 00:32:08.910
when you look at all the incentive structures,

533
00:32:08.920 --> 00:32:12.640
they almost always either come down to current or future promised money in one

534
00:32:12.641 --> 00:32:13.910
form or another.
Um,

535
00:32:13.960 --> 00:32:17.380
health plans are just money that are being spent for you and a certain other

536
00:32:17.381 --> 00:32:19.180
material way.
Uh,

537
00:32:19.210 --> 00:32:23.800
and the point is that we have some needs that money are really,

538
00:32:23.801 --> 00:32:27.220
really good at covering.
So if you go to Maslow's hierarchy,

539
00:32:27.221 --> 00:32:29.440
and this is a simplified form with physical,

540
00:32:29.441 --> 00:32:33.820
social and meaning needs a physical needs are pretty well handled with money,

541
00:32:34.060 --> 00:32:38.650
but the other two aren't at all.
And so again,
these become low hanging fruit.

542
00:32:38.651 --> 00:32:42.860
If nobody is incentivizing anyone with these other approaches,

543
00:32:43.040 --> 00:32:47.210
then they become a really effective way for you to sort of make that kind of

544
00:32:47.211 --> 00:32:50.030
difference in whatever group you're working in.
Okay.

545
00:32:50.150 --> 00:32:55.010
So last chunk of what I'm going to talk about is what I think one of the big

546
00:32:55.011 --> 00:32:57.320
parts of the future of social neuroscience is.

547
00:32:57.470 --> 00:33:02.420
And it's going to have a big connection to the workplace and not just be in,

548
00:33:02.421 --> 00:33:06.410
you know,
the ivory tower where,
um,
I tend to work.
Um,

549
00:33:07.130 --> 00:33:11.720
this kind of work involves getting away from giant,
heavy,

550
00:33:11.920 --> 00:33:16.660
uh,
MRI scanners and getting to lightweight portable mobile neuroimaging

551
00:33:16.670 --> 00:33:21.670
technologies like functional near infrared spectroscopy or f nears a Mris depend

552
00:33:23.571 --> 00:33:28.280
on differences in the magnetic properties of oxygenated and deoxygenated

553
00:33:28.281 --> 00:33:32.870
hemoglobin f nine years is kind of the same except it depends on the light

554
00:33:32.871 --> 00:33:36.440
absorption properties that differ between those two types of blood.
Uh,

555
00:33:36.441 --> 00:33:40.370
it's basically just the same thing as the pulse oximeter you wear on your finger

556
00:33:40.371 --> 00:33:42.140
when you go to the doctors,
uh,

557
00:33:42.141 --> 00:33:46.940
except it's all over your brain and it's super po a portable and mobile.

558
00:33:47.240 --> 00:33:49.310
Uh,
so you can sort of put,

559
00:33:49.400 --> 00:33:53.750
you're basically putting a very small computer and a sizable battery in a

560
00:33:53.751 --> 00:33:57.020
backpack would,
you can either wear or put on the table behind the subject.

561
00:33:57.220 --> 00:33:58.970
It doesn't have to actually be on your back,

562
00:33:59.180 --> 00:34:03.800
but it allows you to be flexible in where you do your research and the kind of

563
00:34:03.801 --> 00:34:07.640
research that you can now do that you could never do with an MRI scanner.

564
00:34:07.820 --> 00:34:10.070
And it has downsides as well.
There's no question.

565
00:34:10.071 --> 00:34:12.500
It doesn't have the same spatial resolution as MRI.

566
00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:16.490
And currently it doesn't penetrate very deep into the brain so it gets you the

567
00:34:16.491 --> 00:34:17.630
cortical surface.

568
00:34:17.930 --> 00:34:22.250
But I think in the next five to seven years that's probably going to change a

569
00:34:22.251 --> 00:34:23.390
fair bit as well.

570
00:34:23.870 --> 00:34:27.800
So the first thing we did when we decided to test out this equipment was we

571
00:34:27.801 --> 00:34:31.010
wanted to go replicate something we had done in our lab over and over again.

572
00:34:31.250 --> 00:34:33.750
So there's this paradigm that Emily Falk,
uh,

573
00:34:33.830 --> 00:34:37.970
one of my former graduate students and I developed where we try to persuade

574
00:34:37.971 --> 00:34:41.030
people while they're laying in the scanner and then we,
uh,

575
00:34:41.240 --> 00:34:45.320
ask them later and track them in various ways using risk trackers and other

576
00:34:45.321 --> 00:34:46.130
things,
uh,

577
00:34:46.130 --> 00:34:50.330
to see how much they've actually changed their behavior in line with whatever we

578
00:34:50.331 --> 00:34:54.560
were trying to persuade them of to use sunscreen more to stop smoking,

579
00:34:54.561 --> 00:34:57.560
to get more physical exercise to sleep more.

580
00:34:57.560 --> 00:35:00.260
We do lots of public health types of things like that.

581
00:35:00.770 --> 00:35:04.790
And it turns out that when you see activity in this medial prefrontal region

582
00:35:04.791 --> 00:35:07.400
here that's shown in yellow there,
when that goes up,

583
00:35:07.401 --> 00:35:08.810
when people are seeing the messages,

584
00:35:09.020 --> 00:35:12.890
people tend to then change their behavior and message consistent ways.

585
00:35:13.040 --> 00:35:16.820
We think this has something to do with basically adopting and integrating the

586
00:35:16.821 --> 00:35:21.380
message into your identity because this is a region that is very much associated

587
00:35:21.560 --> 00:35:25.010
with self processes and valuation.
So we think,

588
00:35:25.100 --> 00:35:28.520
but we don't know for sure that that seems to be part of what's going on there.

589
00:35:29.130 --> 00:35:30.140
On the flip side,

590
00:35:30.141 --> 00:35:33.950
when people are resistant to a persuasive message and they're internally counter

591
00:35:33.951 --> 00:35:38.940
arguing saying this is stupid because you see more in the right dorsal lateral

592
00:35:38.941 --> 00:35:42.810
prefrontal cortex and you'll see less behavior change over time.

593
00:35:43.110 --> 00:35:47.970
So we did the same thing in our first study with f new years and we basically

594
00:35:47.971 --> 00:35:51.300
found the exact same result.
We were actually pretty shocked that we found this.

595
00:35:51.301 --> 00:35:55.080
We thought maybe we'd get a little bit of something,
but there it is.
So,
um,

596
00:35:55.140 --> 00:35:59.810
this is showing to us at least that we can do something analogous with

597
00:35:59.820 --> 00:36:01.590
[inaudible] is that we could be,
you know,

598
00:36:01.591 --> 00:36:03.660
that we've been doing for years and years with Fmr.
I,

599
00:36:03.661 --> 00:36:04.860
and we had a lot of confidence in,

600
00:36:05.370 --> 00:36:10.110
but [inaudible] has the ability to do so much more than just replicate what

601
00:36:10.111 --> 00:36:13.290
we've been able to do while people were laying on their back in the scanner.

602
00:36:13.980 --> 00:36:18.900
And this often involves,
um,
uh,
an approach called neural synchrony.

603
00:36:19.070 --> 00:36:21.750
Uh,
there's other names for it as well,
but I call it neural synchrony.

604
00:36:21.900 --> 00:36:26.220
And the basic idea is you go to the same spot in two different people's brains

605
00:36:26.221 --> 00:36:28.110
as they're experiencing something.

606
00:36:28.440 --> 00:36:32.610
And you look at how the activity there fluctuates over time.

607
00:36:32.970 --> 00:36:37.680
And to the extent that two people in the same spot in their brains are watching

608
00:36:37.681 --> 00:36:42.420
a video or having a conversation and their fluctuations are fluctuating
together,

609
00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:46.680
that's neural synchrony.
And if they're doing random different things,

610
00:36:46.860 --> 00:36:50.010
there is no synchrony in that case.
And it turns out,

611
00:36:50.040 --> 00:36:52.260
and I'll show you data to back this up in a minute,

612
00:36:52.530 --> 00:36:57.530
that what this really tends to get at is whether two people aren't literally

613
00:36:57.751 --> 00:37:02.160
just being exposed to the same thing,
but are sharing the same experience of it.

614
00:37:02.161 --> 00:37:06.030
They're experiencing it and having the same kind of understanding and

615
00:37:06.031 --> 00:37:08.370
perspective on what's going on.

616
00:37:08.730 --> 00:37:12.180
But first I want to show you what neural synchrony,
uh,
looks like.
Uh,

617
00:37:12.181 --> 00:37:16.770
so these are the results of two people.
Uh,

618
00:37:16.860 --> 00:37:20.550
these are their brains,
uh,
watching a fighter pilot video.

619
00:37:20.580 --> 00:37:25.140
They didn't watch it together.
They're just time locked to be shown together.
And,

620
00:37:25.170 --> 00:37:27.150
um,
let's see.
To Orient you,

621
00:37:27.330 --> 00:37:31.170
the more sort of red and orange you can see on the color bar over there,

622
00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:35.490
the more activity that's occurring in that part of the brain and the more a sort

623
00:37:35.491 --> 00:37:37.290
of green and blue,
the less activity.

624
00:37:37.920 --> 00:37:40.620
And so I think you'll be able to hear the sound.
We'll just watch this.

625
00:37:40.621 --> 00:37:41.760
It's a 22nd video,

626
00:37:41.761 --> 00:37:44.550
but hopefully you can see the synchrony occur and with your own eyes.

627
00:37:47.740 --> 00:37:48.573
<v 1>Okay.</v>

628
00:37:49.120 --> 00:37:49.953
<v 2>Are coming up</v>

629
00:37:58.440 --> 00:37:58.870
backers,

630
00:37:58.870 --> 00:38:03.870
the lead of a banking over the top throngs back cause we just send back.

631
00:38:08.680 --> 00:38:11.530
<v 0>Okay,
so hopefully you could sort of see it.
If not,</v>

632
00:38:11.531 --> 00:38:14.830
this is sort of each of the two brains at different points in time.

633
00:38:14.980 --> 00:38:19.000
And you can see that the brains are more like each other than they are their own

634
00:38:19.001 --> 00:38:20.590
brain at other points in time.

635
00:38:21.040 --> 00:38:25.810
Now here's the same video shown again this time without sound,
but this time,

636
00:38:26.110 --> 00:38:28.600
this person on the right is internally doing math.

637
00:38:29.170 --> 00:38:33.520
So their eyes are on the video.
If you're looking at them,

638
00:38:33.610 --> 00:38:37.780
you can't tell that they're experiencing it any differently than this person.

639
00:38:38.020 --> 00:38:39.670
But as soon as you see their brains,

640
00:38:39.730 --> 00:38:43.090
it's obvious they are not experiencing the same thing right now.

641
00:38:43.210 --> 00:38:47.110
They are not responding at all the same way to what they're taking in.

642
00:38:47.560 --> 00:38:49.390
And so this is really,
really cool.

643
00:38:49.391 --> 00:38:53.800
At least I think it's really cool that we can tell this without asking people

644
00:38:53.830 --> 00:38:56.230
how distracted,
where you imagine at a,
you know,

645
00:38:56.231 --> 00:38:59.800
a conference room meeting and you're going to ask everyone,
so how distracted?

646
00:38:59.800 --> 00:39:02.920
Where are you during the meeting?
Nobody's going to say I was distracted,
right?

647
00:39:02.921 --> 00:39:05.230
They're all gonna say,
Oh,
I was totally present and man,

648
00:39:05.231 --> 00:39:07.750
I'm having great ideas after that meeting.
Um,

649
00:39:07.780 --> 00:39:10.810
but we all know that we've been that person and there's other people who are

650
00:39:10.811 --> 00:39:12.340
being that person right now.

651
00:39:12.341 --> 00:39:15.790
Some of you have no idea what I'm talking about right now because you're being

652
00:39:15.791 --> 00:39:17.170
that person right now.
And that's fine.

653
00:39:17.171 --> 00:39:18.940
I have no problem with that because if I was in the audience,

654
00:39:18.941 --> 00:39:21.010
I might be that person.
Um,

655
00:39:21.130 --> 00:39:24.640
but I think that's a really interesting thing to be able to detect that I think

656
00:39:24.641 --> 00:39:27.610
in a pretty robust way.
So,
um,

657
00:39:27.910 --> 00:39:30.540
so let me tell you about something that,

658
00:39:30.541 --> 00:39:34.240
that we've done with this where we can show it's really about people sharing

659
00:39:34.241 --> 00:39:37.450
perspective.
Um,
uh,

660
00:39:37.660 --> 00:39:42.500
so we take the equipment,
we put it in our carry on luggage.
Um,

661
00:39:42.610 --> 00:39:45.900
this is Google earth,
so thank you Google for making this,
it,

662
00:39:45.970 --> 00:39:49.690
this impresses people at every other talk I give,
but I assume it would be like,

663
00:39:49.970 --> 00:39:53.890
ah,
that again here.
Um,
so,
uh,

664
00:39:53.891 --> 00:39:56.650
we go halfway around the world to Amman,
Jordan,

665
00:39:56.651 --> 00:40:00.790
and a for the last three summers we've set up pop up mobile neuroscience labs,

666
00:40:01.060 --> 00:40:06.060
ran the first ever social neuroscience studies run anywhere in the country or

667
00:40:06.580 --> 00:40:09.390
the region.
And,
um,

668
00:40:09.610 --> 00:40:13.720
what we were doing in this particular study that I'm going to tell you about is

669
00:40:13.721 --> 00:40:14.440
we were,

670
00:40:14.440 --> 00:40:19.440
we found participants over there who were either a pro choice or pro life with

671
00:40:20.381 --> 00:40:21.610
respect to abortion.
Now,

672
00:40:21.700 --> 00:40:24.790
there is an important debate over there that's pro life pro choice.

673
00:40:24.791 --> 00:40:26.680
It's not the same as our debate.

674
00:40:27.280 --> 00:40:30.610
There's a general belief that abortion is wrong.
Uh,

675
00:40:30.700 --> 00:40:33.820
but there is a debate over whether or not there should be an exception in the

676
00:40:33.821 --> 00:40:37.600
case of rape.
Okay.
So that's what this particular debate is about.

677
00:40:37.601 --> 00:40:40.990
And there's lots of people on both sides.
It's about a 50,
50 split,

678
00:40:40.991 --> 00:40:43.570
which is what we were looking for.
And then,
uh,

679
00:40:43.660 --> 00:40:48.430
we had videos made of um,
local individuals,

680
00:40:49.080 --> 00:40:53.680
uh,
arguing basically for the pro choice side or the pro life side.

681
00:40:53.681 --> 00:40:55.630
So we have videos,
um,

682
00:40:55.840 --> 00:40:59.650
native language videos where people are arguing for these two different sides.

683
00:40:59.800 --> 00:41:04.720
And both groups saw both videos,
wall wearing,
um,
f nears.

684
00:41:05.080 --> 00:41:07.960
So then I'll take you through kind of what we looked at and how this works.

685
00:41:08.080 --> 00:41:11.990
So both groups watch this pro choice video.
Okay?
Uh,

686
00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:16.060
so let's say we pull out one of the people from the pro choice side.
Okay?

687
00:41:16.061 --> 00:41:20.080
So conceptually they're down here.
Now pretend they're not up there anymore.

688
00:41:20.380 --> 00:41:24.850
And so what we can do is we can look at the extent to which this individual is

689
00:41:24.851 --> 00:41:25.480
showing.

690
00:41:25.480 --> 00:41:30.480
I'm a synchronous response with the average of all the pro choice folks up

691
00:41:30.551 --> 00:41:33.220
there.
Okay?
Um,
and you can do this iteratively.

692
00:41:33.230 --> 00:41:36.380
So then you pull out a different subject and put this one back and you do it for

693
00:41:36.381 --> 00:41:40.190
everyone so that you see how each person is correlated with the rest of the

694
00:41:40.191 --> 00:41:42.620
group and the pro choice group.
And when you do this,

695
00:41:42.621 --> 00:41:47.270
what you see is that there's lots of synchrony.
So read on the scale is,
you know,

696
00:41:47.271 --> 00:41:51.320
up at the high end.
And then yellow is,
is also pretty high as well.

697
00:41:51.321 --> 00:41:54.470
So we see lots of synchrony there.
But when we do the same thing,

698
00:41:54.471 --> 00:41:58.490
where we take someone who is pro choice and see how their brain responses

699
00:41:58.491 --> 00:42:02.630
correlate with the folks who are pro life,
it's basically zero correlations,
uh,

700
00:42:02.660 --> 00:42:06.710
throughout the brain,
throughout the frontal cortex where we were looking.
Okay.

701
00:42:06.800 --> 00:42:09.830
So they're seeing the exact same video,
right?

702
00:42:09.831 --> 00:42:11.990
Like the same photons are hitting their eyes,

703
00:42:12.110 --> 00:42:13.940
the same sound waves are hitting their ears,

704
00:42:14.090 --> 00:42:17.600
but they experience it like them and not like them.

705
00:42:17.630 --> 00:42:21.460
And that's what's coming out here.
And we can reverse it a,

706
00:42:21.560 --> 00:42:24.550
so now you pull someone out from the prolife group,
um,

707
00:42:24.580 --> 00:42:26.930
and they'll show synchrony with the prolife group,

708
00:42:26.960 --> 00:42:30.470
but not with the pro choice group,
just for complete sake.
Um,

709
00:42:30.500 --> 00:42:33.200
and so once we started getting results like this,

710
00:42:33.201 --> 00:42:38.060
we started thinking that there were kind of a wide range of applications.
And so,

711
00:42:38.330 --> 00:42:41.960
um,
one of the other people in my department sort of prodded me.

712
00:42:41.961 --> 00:42:45.650
And so we went and started a company so that we could do this in other places

713
00:42:45.651 --> 00:42:50.150
where we wouldn't ordinarily study this in a inside sort of Ucla.

714
00:42:50.540 --> 00:42:55.400
And so the idea here is that as long as we have two different kinds of reference

715
00:42:55.401 --> 00:43:00.140
groups getting out a particular kind of way of experiencing a piece of the

716
00:43:00.141 --> 00:43:00.974
world,

717
00:43:01.100 --> 00:43:06.100
we can now basically figure out what a new case is actually seeing and

718
00:43:06.171 --> 00:43:08.570
experiencing when they're looking at something.

719
00:43:08.570 --> 00:43:11.360
Because we can look at the extent to which they look like more of a match for

720
00:43:11.361 --> 00:43:13.130
one group or another.

721
00:43:13.250 --> 00:43:16.520
And this lets us basically and broadly speaking,

722
00:43:16.670 --> 00:43:18.770
study the science of compatibility.

723
00:43:18.771 --> 00:43:21.980
And it's in a very sort of broad kind of definition.

724
00:43:22.220 --> 00:43:26.030
And so the idea here is if you experience something in similar ways as another

725
00:43:26.031 --> 00:43:27.890
person or group,
um,

726
00:43:27.960 --> 00:43:31.610
Daniel show greater synchrony with that person or group under the proper

727
00:43:31.611 --> 00:43:36.560
stimulus conditions.
So the pro choice person watching approach,
voice,

728
00:43:36.561 --> 00:43:40.430
video,
not watching the Superbowl,
but watching the pro choice video,

729
00:43:40.610 --> 00:43:44.420
then they're experiencing something in the same way or a similar way to those

730
00:43:44.421 --> 00:43:47.570
folks.
Um,
and so then you can see that sort of thing.

731
00:43:47.571 --> 00:43:51.720
So imagine instead of looking at this,
um,
we were trying to figure out,
uh,

732
00:43:51.820 --> 00:43:55.070
who would accompany,
is experiencing burnout right now.
Right?

733
00:43:55.160 --> 00:43:59.210
Some people in this room right now are feeling burned out working.
It's just,

734
00:43:59.211 --> 00:44:00.170
it's a fact of the matter.

735
00:44:00.171 --> 00:44:04.070
There's a decent percentage of people that are feeling burned out and it's a big

736
00:44:04.071 --> 00:44:07.670
problem,
right?
I mean,
people who are burned out leave before they leave.

737
00:44:07.671 --> 00:44:10.760
Their productivity goes way down.
Burnout is contagious.

738
00:44:10.910 --> 00:44:14.390
It's something that like anyone running a company or somewhere up in management

739
00:44:14.391 --> 00:44:18.170
really,
really wants to avoid,
but you can't go to your employees and say,

740
00:44:18.200 --> 00:44:21.470
tell me on a scale from one to 10,
how burned out are you feeling?
Um,

741
00:44:21.530 --> 00:44:23.900
because people are typically not going to tell you.

742
00:44:23.901 --> 00:44:27.170
That's not one of those things we reveal in interviews and,

743
00:44:27.171 --> 00:44:29.840
and performance reviews and things like that.

744
00:44:30.500 --> 00:44:35.220
But we can do the same kind of thing we did with the pro choice pro life.
Okay.

745
00:44:35.470 --> 00:44:37.680
Uh,
but now instead of looking at pro choice pro life,

746
00:44:37.681 --> 00:44:42.681
we're looking at videos of CEOs and executives talking about feeling really

747
00:44:42.721 --> 00:44:45.210
engaged or feeling burned out.
Okay.

748
00:44:45.360 --> 00:44:49.410
And then we have people that have already told us that they are feeling engaged,

749
00:44:49.411 --> 00:44:50.041
are burned out,

750
00:44:50.041 --> 00:44:54.330
and we can see how they respond when they watched these videos and look at how

751
00:44:54.331 --> 00:44:57.690
that relates to individuals in this way.
So to get it this,

752
00:44:57.691 --> 00:45:01.290
it's hard to get a bunch of executives and CEOs in a room.

753
00:45:01.291 --> 00:45:04.980
They don't like to all show up at the same time.
So we went to them,
um,

754
00:45:04.990 --> 00:45:08.430
a few months ago we went to this event summit La,
it's a,

755
00:45:08.431 --> 00:45:13.230
an ideas fast for basically really wealthy CEOs and executives.
Um,

756
00:45:13.231 --> 00:45:16.260
I could never afford to go to this event unless I was invited,

757
00:45:16.261 --> 00:45:20.010
which I was thankfully.
Uh,
and so once we were there,

758
00:45:20.011 --> 00:45:21.780
people say yes to everything.

759
00:45:22.050 --> 00:45:25.920
And so we were super excited that a bunch of CEOs and executives were happy to

760
00:45:25.921 --> 00:45:28.710
come in and get their brain scan together.
Um,

761
00:45:28.740 --> 00:45:32.760
this is literally the first time four people have ever been scanned while having

762
00:45:32.761 --> 00:45:36.060
a conversation.
Like that's never happened in any form.
Um,

763
00:45:36.061 --> 00:45:39.240
so we thought that was pretty cool in and of itself and they did interesting

764
00:45:39.241 --> 00:45:41.670
things while they were having conversations.

765
00:45:41.760 --> 00:45:43.770
I'm not going to tell you about that data today.

766
00:45:44.070 --> 00:45:47.370
But another thing they did is at one point there's a TV here.

767
00:45:47.490 --> 00:45:52.350
They all turned and looked at the TV and they watched videos like these.

768
00:45:52.351 --> 00:45:56.430
So they saw some people talking about how engaged and excited they are at work.

769
00:45:56.431 --> 00:45:57.264
Like this guy.

770
00:45:57.570 --> 00:46:01.890
<v 3>What's really exciting to me personally is the the ability to make an impact for</v>

771
00:46:01.891 --> 00:46:04.100
millions if not billions of people,
you know,

772
00:46:04.110 --> 00:46:08.790
having a commercially successful product that is driven by technology but

773
00:46:08.820 --> 00:46:10.830
ultimately making the human experience better.

774
00:46:10.860 --> 00:46:13.500
We get a lot of messages saying thank you ivy,

775
00:46:13.501 --> 00:46:16.500
which is our hotel concierges that we created by texting you.

776
00:46:16.501 --> 00:46:19.740
I was able to get it in two minutes at my door and it really you,

777
00:46:19.810 --> 00:46:20.730
you're a lifesaver,

778
00:46:21.610 --> 00:46:25.450
<v 0>right?
So you've got people like that and then you've also gotten it,
to be fair,</v>

779
00:46:25.570 --> 00:46:28.930
he talked about the both the good and bad side and this next guy talked about

780
00:46:28.931 --> 00:46:29.920
the good and bad side.

781
00:46:30.070 --> 00:46:34.140
So it's not like this next guy is like super burned out and we have to everyone

782
00:46:34.150 --> 00:46:36.880
to talk about both aspects of their job at different times.

783
00:46:37.510 --> 00:46:40.840
This is someone talking about feeling stressed out about being a CEO.

784
00:46:41.320 --> 00:46:44.520
<v 4>Um,
you know,
it's a very stressful environment.
It's sort of high risk,</v>

785
00:46:44.521 --> 00:46:44.970
high reward.

786
00:46:44.970 --> 00:46:48.960
You've got a lot riding on pulling it off and that falls on the CEO and on

787
00:46:48.961 --> 00:46:51.870
management.
And you've got,
you know,
your investors are relying on you.

788
00:46:51.871 --> 00:46:55.830
You've got your employees who um,
uh,
you know,

789
00:46:56.040 --> 00:46:59.370
that's their job and they're feeding their families and their living.
And so,

790
00:46:59.520 --> 00:47:02.580
you know,
a lot of times it gets very close to the flame.
It's

791
00:47:03.270 --> 00:47:03.750
<v 0>okay.</v>

792
00:47:03.750 --> 00:47:07.440
So imagine that you're either feeling super jazzed about the work you're doing,

793
00:47:07.441 --> 00:47:09.750
you're right where you should be or you're feeling burned out.

794
00:47:09.960 --> 00:47:14.490
You're probably going to experience these two kinds of videos differently based

795
00:47:14.491 --> 00:47:17.190
on what's going on with you in your life right now.

796
00:47:17.191 --> 00:47:20.010
And so that's what we wanted to look at.
So,
um,

797
00:47:20.190 --> 00:47:23.280
basically everything I'm going to show you is from this same medial prefrontal

798
00:47:23.281 --> 00:47:26.280
spot that I've shown you in some of the previous studies before.

799
00:47:26.490 --> 00:47:30.760
It seems to be associated with identity and sort of integrating things.

800
00:47:30.761 --> 00:47:33.640
And I'm identifying with something that you're taking in.

801
00:47:34.030 --> 00:47:38.200
And so what we see is that when people are watching the sort of,

802
00:47:38.201 --> 00:47:41.140
what do you love about what you do,
types of videos,

803
00:47:41.440 --> 00:47:45.430
what we see is that the sort of engaged CEOs and executives,
um,

804
00:47:45.600 --> 00:47:49.930
they show a fair amount of synchrony with one another in,
in that condition.

805
00:47:50.140 --> 00:47:53.680
But the folks who are feeling burned out don't really show any synchrony when

806
00:47:53.681 --> 00:47:57.340
they're watching these folks talk about how excited and engaged they are.

807
00:47:57.730 --> 00:48:00.700
When you see the folks talking about being stressed and burned out.

808
00:48:00.880 --> 00:48:05.860
Now instead you see the burned out.
Um,
folks who are sort of stressed and,

809
00:48:05.861 --> 00:48:07.180
and feeling the pressure,

810
00:48:07.330 --> 00:48:10.820
these folks are showing more synchrony with one another.
Um,

811
00:48:11.080 --> 00:48:14.890
then the executives who are engaged in thriving and so on.

812
00:48:14.891 --> 00:48:16.750
So putting that together,
uh,

813
00:48:16.751 --> 00:48:21.751
what you essentially see is that the engage CEOs show I'm a lot more synchrony

814
00:48:22.270 --> 00:48:26.140
for the engaged videos and the folks who are feeling more burned out,

815
00:48:26.141 --> 00:48:30.640
show more synchrony with the,
the burnout videos,
the stress videos.
Right.

816
00:48:30.820 --> 00:48:34.870
And we were actually using very simple sort of machine learning classification,

817
00:48:35.050 --> 00:48:40.050
able to classify about 85% of the folks who were feeling burned out as being

818
00:48:42.221 --> 00:48:45.940
burned out based on their brain data.
Uh,
and so,
you know,

819
00:48:45.941 --> 00:48:48.820
I think that's sort of a promising thing because,
you know,
doing this,

820
00:48:48.821 --> 00:48:50.890
you don't actually have to go ask folks.

821
00:48:51.040 --> 00:48:53.350
We knew because we were running that kind of study.

822
00:48:53.500 --> 00:48:57.010
But in the future it could be used in an application where you don't know in

823
00:48:57.011 --> 00:48:59.950
advance.
Um,
who's feeling one way or the other?

824
00:49:00.070 --> 00:49:04.960
I'll just mention a couple of the other applications of this before I stop.
Um,

825
00:49:05.470 --> 00:49:09.850
Dana Landis is in here,
right?
Is that right?
Now?
Okay.
So Dana Landis is at Google,

826
00:49:09.851 --> 00:49:12.730
but she's also,
um,
on our advisory board.

827
00:49:12.940 --> 00:49:16.690
And so we've talked with her about sort of working towards,
um,

828
00:49:16.900 --> 00:49:20.170
solutions for the diversity pipeline.
I know you guys have it in tech.

829
00:49:20.171 --> 00:49:24.400
We have it in academia.
It's a,
a genuine,
real issue that's really,

830
00:49:24.401 --> 00:49:25.630
really hard to solve.

831
00:49:25.840 --> 00:49:29.830
And one of the things that we've sort of talked about is that you can go to

832
00:49:29.831 --> 00:49:31.960
folks who aren't necessarily,
uh,
you know,

833
00:49:31.961 --> 00:49:34.040
necessarily getting exposed to the best,
uh,

834
00:49:34.210 --> 00:49:38.590
training and they're not getting it in an environment saying an inner school,
um,

835
00:49:38.760 --> 00:49:41.830
uh,
inner city school environment,
elementary school,

836
00:49:41.831 --> 00:49:44.920
middle school and so on where not only are you not getting it,

837
00:49:44.921 --> 00:49:48.760
but there's not a lot of emphasis in the family or among friends to really

838
00:49:48.761 --> 00:49:53.350
cultivate an attitude towards what I should spend my time and energy on is

839
00:49:53.351 --> 00:49:55.600
learning how to do Algebra or something like that.

840
00:49:55.600 --> 00:49:59.710
It's just not necessarily especially valued for understandable reasons in that

841
00:49:59.711 --> 00:50:00.544
context.

842
00:50:00.700 --> 00:50:05.260
But if you can go in and actually look at who shows brain responses when they

843
00:50:05.261 --> 00:50:09.790
look at certain mathematical or other types of stem concepts that even look a

844
00:50:09.791 --> 00:50:12.610
bit more like folks who have excelled in that region,

845
00:50:12.850 --> 00:50:17.230
could you identify aptitude and folks who aren't going to show it on traditional

846
00:50:17.231 --> 00:50:21.190
tests?
And there's some reasons to think that you actually can do this as this is

847
00:50:21.191 --> 00:50:23.650
something where if you can identify those folks when they're young,

848
00:50:23.800 --> 00:50:27.040
you could bring them over summers to sort of summer institutes where they,

849
00:50:27.290 --> 00:50:32.120
some of the kinds of exposure and a sort of norm setting that would lead people

850
00:50:32.121 --> 00:50:36.500
to get to a place like Google where they probably wouldn't otherwise.

851
00:50:36.590 --> 00:50:40.490
And probably the idea that I'm most excited about is that if we can get data

852
00:50:40.491 --> 00:50:44.180
from the other work we're doing on what sort of thriving,

853
00:50:44.181 --> 00:50:48.170
engaged brains look like in a bunch of different careers.
Okay,

854
00:50:48.380 --> 00:50:50.960
then you could develop what we call the neural guidance counselor,

855
00:50:51.050 --> 00:50:53.870
where you could take a 17 year old who has no idea what to do with their life.

856
00:50:53.871 --> 00:50:55.580
And if you go to a regular guidance counselor,

857
00:50:55.581 --> 00:50:58.220
you're not going to get any better idea of what to do with your life.

858
00:50:58.520 --> 00:51:01.970
I don't know that anyone's ever had a good experience with a guidance counselor.

859
00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:06.740
They're either neutral or creepy.
Like those are like the two options.
Um,

860
00:51:06.770 --> 00:51:09.350
but what if you could basically go find out,
okay,

861
00:51:09.351 --> 00:51:12.650
well these are the things where you as a 17 year old,

862
00:51:12.651 --> 00:51:17.210
you look at certain things in a way that's at least a bit similar to people in

863
00:51:17.211 --> 00:51:19.550
certain professions who are both productive,

864
00:51:19.580 --> 00:51:23.600
successful and really happy doing that job.

865
00:51:24.260 --> 00:51:29.000
Um,
there's lots of other things to think about in terms of,
uh,
team construction.

866
00:51:29.180 --> 00:51:32.630
So we had these groups at summit and they were having conversations with each

867
00:51:32.631 --> 00:51:36.460
other and there's lots of interesting dynamics.
Like we varied,
uh,

868
00:51:36.470 --> 00:51:39.980
the gender composition of the groups across the sessions and we don't have that

869
00:51:39.981 --> 00:51:41.600
data analyzed yet,
but we're really,

870
00:51:41.601 --> 00:51:46.220
really interested to see how synchrony profiles change when it's zero women,

871
00:51:46.221 --> 00:51:48.560
one women to women through women's.
So on.
Right.

872
00:51:48.561 --> 00:51:50.330
That's going to be really interesting.
Also,

873
00:51:50.870 --> 00:51:54.410
some of these people are the same people who told us they were feeling burned

874
00:51:54.411 --> 00:51:55.130
out.

875
00:51:55.130 --> 00:51:59.330
It turns out the people who are feeling burned out also reported being the least

876
00:51:59.331 --> 00:52:03.100
interested and engaged in what anyone else had to say when they were at the

877
00:52:03.101 --> 00:52:04.070
sessions.
Right?

878
00:52:04.071 --> 00:52:07.940
So here's a way in which the sort of burnout feature is actually having a

879
00:52:07.941 --> 00:52:10.850
genuine impact on the way they interact with others.

880
00:52:11.030 --> 00:52:13.640
And when the folks who are feeling burned out was asked,

881
00:52:13.850 --> 00:52:17.600
who was the most interesting,
engaging person at the table,

882
00:52:17.870 --> 00:52:21.800
they were much more likely than anyone else to say me.
Okay.

883
00:52:21.860 --> 00:52:24.470
Most other people pointed to someone else at the table,

884
00:52:24.471 --> 00:52:27.290
I mean in writing and said,
oh,
that person was really interesting.

885
00:52:27.560 --> 00:52:29.750
But the folks who are feeling burned out,
they said,

886
00:52:29.840 --> 00:52:33.140
I guess I was the only interesting person at the table.
Um,

887
00:52:33.170 --> 00:52:35.540
last thing is that,
um,

888
00:52:35.630 --> 00:52:39.560
there's the obvious I think application that this actually directly applies to

889
00:52:39.590 --> 00:52:43.100
regular old matchmaking.
Um,
and uh,

890
00:52:43.130 --> 00:52:44.870
we've thought about this a fair bit,

891
00:52:44.871 --> 00:52:49.220
but we think that this gets at a kind of compatibility where,
you know,
when you,

892
00:52:49.250 --> 00:52:51.800
uh,
you know,
use Tinder or whatever else,

893
00:52:51.950 --> 00:52:56.950
there's no measurement of compatibility on match.com or e harmony who even used

894
00:52:57.261 --> 00:53:00.860
to pretend that they did compatibility.
It turns out it wasn't.

895
00:53:00.861 --> 00:53:03.500
There's interesting stories about that that I won't go into,

896
00:53:04.100 --> 00:53:08.750
but you can actually measure compatibility in a,
in a meaningful sort of way.

897
00:53:08.930 --> 00:53:10.370
You want to find people,

898
00:53:10.460 --> 00:53:14.510
like the person that you want to find and spend your life with is probably going

899
00:53:14.511 --> 00:53:19.511
to be someone that actually in meaningful ways sees the world similarly to the

900
00:53:19.551 --> 00:53:24.290
way you see it.
Not visually,
but conceptually.
And this is a way to get at that.

901
00:53:24.440 --> 00:53:26.820
And there is data that suggests that this,
in fact,

902
00:53:26.821 --> 00:53:29.850
Ken predict who will become friends.
Uh,

903
00:53:29.851 --> 00:53:34.650
and there's no reason to think it couldn't predict who would become friends that

904
00:53:34.651 --> 00:53:37.620
are more than friends if you take into account attraction and things like that.

905
00:53:37.950 --> 00:53:42.360
Um,
so I think that's sort of a really interesting feature of this as well.

906
00:53:42.660 --> 00:53:46.710
So,
uh,
I know that at this point,
um,

907
00:53:46.800 --> 00:53:50.770
I have gone long and so I will stop there and,
uh,

908
00:53:51.090 --> 00:53:53.390
say thank you and I'm happy to take any questions if there are any.
Thank you.

909
00:53:58.140 --> 00:53:58.640
<v 5>Yup.</v>

910
00:53:58.640 --> 00:54:02.930
<v 6>So is there any sense of what types of companies increased social interactions?</v>

911
00:54:02.931 --> 00:54:04.400
Like what are the variables that are relevant?

912
00:54:04.610 --> 00:54:07.610
Like one of the ones that we talk about often as the open workspace environment.

913
00:54:07.730 --> 00:54:09.950
There's like a big study that came out about a recently.
Yeah.

914
00:54:10.160 --> 00:54:13.310
Are there other things like that that kind of are useful when it comes to and

915
00:54:13.311 --> 00:54:15.230
Chris and sorta like social interaction in a good way?

916
00:54:15.390 --> 00:54:17.810
<v 0>Yeah,
sure.
So,
um,
I,</v>

917
00:54:17.850 --> 00:54:21.690
and I've given talks for companies about sort of creating agile workspaces
where,

918
00:54:21.840 --> 00:54:24.210
you know,
nobody has their own desk or anything like that.

919
00:54:24.660 --> 00:54:28.470
It kind of seems like a disaster,
um,
to do that for lots of reasons.

920
00:54:28.471 --> 00:54:31.500
I think anyone who works in one of those spaces knows you get a room full of

921
00:54:31.501 --> 00:54:32.730
people wearing headphones,

922
00:54:33.450 --> 00:54:36.780
but people also feel a bit better if they have some space ownership.

923
00:54:36.781 --> 00:54:40.860
It turns out a lot of the motivation for making those kinds of spaces is that

924
00:54:40.861 --> 00:54:43.830
the company can lease a lot less space because when you're not there,

925
00:54:43.831 --> 00:54:46.110
somebody else can sit at the same desk.
Right?
Um,

926
00:54:46.440 --> 00:54:51.440
now there is evidence that suggests that I'm putting people in proximity to each

927
00:54:53.011 --> 00:54:54.450
other is really important.

928
00:54:54.451 --> 00:54:58.440
So humanize who did the thing with the water cooler or 15 minute breaks and so

929
00:54:58.441 --> 00:55:00.780
on.
One of the other studies they did is they looked at,

930
00:55:00.781 --> 00:55:03.910
I think this was with Deutsche Bank,
um,
were some bank,

931
00:55:03.911 --> 00:55:07.320
I may not be Deutsche Bank,
I may just have that on the brain lately.
Um,

932
00:55:07.410 --> 00:55:11.460
but they had different banks were in some of the banks,

933
00:55:11.461 --> 00:55:15.870
everyone who worked in a certain division was on the same floor.

934
00:55:16.050 --> 00:55:19.860
And in some companies they were just on slightly different floors,

935
00:55:19.940 --> 00:55:24.210
like one floor apart with a stairwell internal to it connecting them.

936
00:55:24.450 --> 00:55:25.860
And there were dramatic differences.

937
00:55:25.861 --> 00:55:29.790
They managed to convince them to switch one of these,
uh,

938
00:55:29.880 --> 00:55:32.400
to one of these and the productivity went way up.

939
00:55:32.790 --> 00:55:37.110
And that seems to be due to the fact that now you've created a better case for

940
00:55:37.111 --> 00:55:40.740
social permeability so that people can connect more easily and so on.

941
00:55:40.950 --> 00:55:42.240
I think the other thing is,

942
00:55:43.080 --> 00:55:48.080
is that we tend to just not think about it very much and so it's easy to do.

943
00:55:48.120 --> 00:55:52.590
I run a lab,
it's easy for me to forget that.
Um,
you know,
in some sense,

944
00:55:52.591 --> 00:55:57.270
part of my job is,
uh,
providing for and creating the right social atmosphere.

945
00:55:57.271 --> 00:55:58.080
We think,
well,

946
00:55:58.080 --> 00:56:02.190
I provide my students with resources and I try to give them sort of good advice

947
00:56:02.191 --> 00:56:04.000
and wisdom and so on.
Um,

948
00:56:04.050 --> 00:56:07.740
but this is also where they're living part of their social life for several

949
00:56:07.740 --> 00:56:10.250
years.
I mean,
we spent so many hours at work,
um,

950
00:56:10.251 --> 00:56:14.190
that that has to sort of have some of the same features that we look for outside

951
00:56:14.191 --> 00:56:17.280
of work.
And I think that companies sort of think,
well,

952
00:56:17.281 --> 00:56:19.380
I don't want to spend extra money on those things,

953
00:56:19.560 --> 00:56:22.970
but it turns out you're not because it reduces burnout at reducing.

954
00:56:23.380 --> 00:56:25.030
It's a good play for the company,

955
00:56:25.031 --> 00:56:28.210
but it's also really good for the people who work there.
Sure.

956
00:56:29.060 --> 00:56:31.740
<v 7>I new nears.
Yeah.
So I think,
uh,</v>

957
00:56:31.741 --> 00:56:35.780
I'm just thinking whether it could be useful for personal emotion note to

958
00:56:35.781 --> 00:56:40.040
element or,
I mean,
how much does it cost it?
Have you thought about that?

959
00:56:41.090 --> 00:56:42.710
Sure.
So,
um,

960
00:56:43.330 --> 00:56:45.950
<v 0>they're,
I mean,
they're,
okay,
so there's a couple of answers to this.</v>

961
00:56:45.980 --> 00:56:50.980
One is there's a lot of fly by night equipment out on the market right now and

962
00:56:51.861 --> 00:56:54.650
the vast majority of it is junk.
Um,

963
00:56:54.651 --> 00:56:59.630
so there's like a bunch of portable EEG things where you get a single lead that

964
00:56:59.631 --> 00:57:02.540
doesn't actually connect the right way to the scalp,

965
00:57:02.541 --> 00:57:06.170
like you're supposed to use certain kinds of leads that those don't because

966
00:57:06.171 --> 00:57:08.100
they're messy and expensive.
Um,

967
00:57:08.180 --> 00:57:11.780
and so there's a lot of stuff out there that's junk that people are using that

968
00:57:11.840 --> 00:57:15.940
I'm sure there's some signal but it's also a signal swamped by noise.
Um,

969
00:57:16.190 --> 00:57:19.670
f nears like anything has some signal,
some noise.
So you know,

970
00:57:19.790 --> 00:57:23.780
but I think the signal I've been convinced at the signal is meaningful at this

971
00:57:23.781 --> 00:57:24.230
point,

972
00:57:24.230 --> 00:57:28.580
although we're still sort of testing those things in terms of using them for

973
00:57:28.581 --> 00:57:30.390
sort of personal use.
Um,

974
00:57:30.530 --> 00:57:35.530
I do think that that is a plausible longer sort of time horizons scenario.

975
00:57:36.081 --> 00:57:39.530
Right now.
They are a bit clunky to set up.

976
00:57:39.531 --> 00:57:41.150
You need a technician there to set it up.

977
00:57:41.151 --> 00:57:44.840
I don't know that you could effectively set up your own right now.
Um,

978
00:57:45.140 --> 00:57:47.810
but we are working with hardware companies about uh,

979
00:57:47.930 --> 00:57:51.530
engineering plans for how to make this more consumer friendly at some point down

980
00:57:51.531 --> 00:57:52.190
the road.

981
00:57:52.190 --> 00:57:55.400
So I think maybe in five years we might be looking at that if you wanted to buy

982
00:57:55.401 --> 00:57:56.270
one for yourself.

983
00:57:56.720 --> 00:58:01.720
The sort of the lowest end one that I would think is really worth using is

984
00:58:03.681 --> 00:58:08.600
probably about a hundred grand.
Um,
there's toy ones that you can get for 50,

985
00:58:08.601 --> 00:58:11.600
but they are,
I really do think they are toys and very,

986
00:58:11.601 --> 00:58:12.980
very limited in what they can do.

987
00:58:13.460 --> 00:58:17.180
A hundred grand would basically get you with pretty good signal,

988
00:58:17.181 --> 00:58:20.660
your prefrontal cortex and then it doubles and triples and so on from there.

989
00:58:20.930 --> 00:58:23.240
And then in terms of the other part of the question,

990
00:58:23.720 --> 00:58:26.360
could you use it for post personal emotional development?

991
00:58:27.140 --> 00:58:29.300
It would take something really rigorous,

992
00:58:29.301 --> 00:58:33.050
I think set up by some kind of company to make that work.

993
00:58:33.230 --> 00:58:36.830
I don't think you could just sort of sit there and stare at your signal and say,

994
00:58:36.831 --> 00:58:39.080
okay,
I'm going to work these parts of my brain and,

995
00:58:39.081 --> 00:58:42.530
and have that be terribly meaningful.
Yeah.
So,

996
00:58:42.600 --> 00:58:46.610
so we actually a right now are starting a collaboration with a clinical

997
00:58:46.611 --> 00:58:48.620
psychologist at Ucla,
Michelle crass,

998
00:58:48.920 --> 00:58:53.920
where we're going to have both the therapist and the client where f nears during

999
00:58:54.441 --> 00:58:58.040
like they do like 12 sessions,
12 weeks of sessions.

1000
00:58:58.041 --> 00:59:02.780
And so they're going to do it in week one,
I think week three,
six,
nine and 12.

1001
00:59:03.060 --> 00:59:03.361
Um,

1002
00:59:03.361 --> 00:59:08.060
and so we're very interested in how the dynamics both within the individuals and

1003
00:59:08.061 --> 00:59:12.830
across the individuals change over time and how that predicts a sort of who

1004
00:59:12.831 --> 00:59:16.100
feels like they've gotten the most out of it and also who sticks with it because

1005
00:59:16.101 --> 00:59:19.550
most people actually drop out before they get to what therapists say should be

1006
00:59:19.551 --> 00:59:21.900
the natural stopping point I met.

1007
00:59:22.420 --> 00:59:25.430
<v 8>Um,
I also have a question about,
um,
f years.
Um,</v>

1008
00:59:25.790 --> 00:59:28.820
so the first thing that pops in my head when you mentioned that it could be used

1009
00:59:28.821 --> 00:59:32.420
to measure burnout when people don't actually accurately report it as something

1010
00:59:32.421 --> 00:59:35.390
like Black Mirror.
Um,
and I was saying it was just one,
not to bias you,

1011
00:59:35.391 --> 00:59:36.500
but I was wondering,
um,

1012
00:59:36.890 --> 00:59:41.570
what do you see as like a practically a way to get people to,
um,
to,

1013
00:59:41.750 --> 00:59:44.780
to get their burnout measured or something similar like that and what are the

1014
00:59:44.781 --> 00:59:46.770
ethical implications of being able to do that?
Right.

1015
00:59:47.230 --> 00:59:50.570
<v 0>Um,
so that's a good question.
Uh,
we,
we get the burnout,
the,</v>

1016
00:59:50.571 --> 00:59:53.020
the black mirror comment very regularly.

1017
00:59:53.740 --> 00:59:57.250
We actually at some point thought about like naming the company something that

1018
00:59:57.251 --> 00:59:58.960
would be an inside joke about black mirror,

1019
00:59:58.961 --> 01:00:02.340
like something from one of the episodes just to be like really like,
Yep,
that's,

1020
01:00:02.341 --> 01:00:04.840
that's where you know,
we live.
Um,

1021
01:00:05.290 --> 01:00:10.290
and I think that really depends on sort of how a company wants to sort of pitch

1022
01:00:11.621 --> 01:00:14.770
what they're doing to their employees.
So,
you know,

1023
01:00:14.860 --> 01:00:19.860
if finding out folks are burned out is then used in some threatening way,

1024
01:00:20.380 --> 01:00:22.240
then you know,
that's not really good for anyone.

1025
01:00:22.480 --> 01:00:26.680
But if it's used in a way to sort of direct more resources and to sort of help

1026
01:00:26.681 --> 01:00:31.450
folks who are vulnerable for leaving the company or who might benefit from

1027
01:00:31.451 --> 01:00:33.420
certain types of interventions,
um,

1028
01:00:33.550 --> 01:00:36.130
then that's something that I think is probably more positive.

1029
01:00:36.130 --> 01:00:38.770
But I totally agree that there's some uses of what we're doing.

1030
01:00:38.920 --> 01:00:40.690
Like the neural guidance counselor thing,

1031
01:00:41.230 --> 01:00:43.300
that's a pure benefit for anyone who goes and does it.

1032
01:00:43.301 --> 01:00:45.070
Like if you're 17 and you go and do this,

1033
01:00:45.250 --> 01:00:49.780
you get told like you're a 90% match with this and a 30% match with that and do

1034
01:00:49.781 --> 01:00:52.600
without what you want.
But you might not have known these things.

1035
01:00:52.601 --> 01:00:54.340
A lot of us grew up thinking,
well,

1036
01:00:54.341 --> 01:00:56.770
I should do what my parents did or something like that.

1037
01:00:56.780 --> 01:00:59.110
Are we getting to a random internship after college?

1038
01:00:59.290 --> 01:01:02.320
And suddenly that's our career 20 years later.
Um,

1039
01:01:02.350 --> 01:01:06.490
this is a way to sort of try out things that you could never go try out on your

1040
01:01:06.491 --> 01:01:07.030
own.

1041
01:01:07.030 --> 01:01:10.870
So I think that there's sort of a range of different applications and some of

1042
01:01:10.871 --> 01:01:15.160
them,
um,
I think that folks who want to use this,
we'll have to think about,
well,

1043
01:01:15.161 --> 01:01:17.440
what are the benefits that a person gets?

1044
01:01:17.440 --> 01:01:21.760
And there are lots of potential benefits so you could get information yourself

1045
01:01:21.761 --> 01:01:24.250
that relates not necessarily just to burn out if you're feeling burned out,

1046
01:01:24.251 --> 01:01:25.270
you probably know that.

1047
01:01:25.510 --> 01:01:28.590
But there's a lot of other things about the extent to which you serve shows

1048
01:01:28.600 --> 01:01:31.450
certain kinds of skills and aptitudes and so on.
Uh,

1049
01:01:31.540 --> 01:01:35.350
people love things like the Myers Briggs,
even though it's complete junk,
right?

1050
01:01:35.351 --> 01:01:38.500
It doesn't actually tell you anything meaningfully,
any,
you know,

1051
01:01:38.680 --> 01:01:43.630
psychometrician we'll say don't ever,
ever use that.
Um,
but people are really,

1052
01:01:43.631 --> 01:01:46.420
really interested because they want to sort of get this kind of standardized

1053
01:01:46.421 --> 01:01:50.500
feedback.
And I think that is one of the things that this could be used to do.

1054
01:01:50.501 --> 01:01:53.410
We haven't done that specifically,
but I think it could be used in,

1055
01:01:53.411 --> 01:01:56.570
in some of those domains.
And it could be used,
um,

1056
01:01:56.620 --> 01:01:59.980
to see if you sort of qualify to get certain kinds of trainings or promotions or

1057
01:01:59.981 --> 01:02:02.260
whatever.
So you could have your brain scan.

1058
01:02:02.261 --> 01:02:05.530
So imagine the neural guidance counselor and it says you're a great match for

1059
01:02:05.531 --> 01:02:08.440
this,
but you don't test well and things like that.
Right?

1060
01:02:08.441 --> 01:02:12.280
This could be common part of partial substitute where you say,
well,

1061
01:02:12.310 --> 01:02:15.460
I don't test well,
but I'll probably do the actual thing.
Well,

1062
01:02:15.461 --> 01:02:18.490
because my brain looks like the people who do the actual thing.
Well,

1063
01:02:18.820 --> 01:02:20.160
that's an interesting possibility.

1064
01:02:20.520 --> 01:02:21.840
<v 9>And on behalf of Google,</v>

1065
01:02:21.870 --> 01:02:25.800
I would like to thank Matt and would also like to say Ucla is very lucky to have

1066
01:02:25.801 --> 01:02:28.830
you and we are very lucky to have you for this hour.
Thank you,
Luke.

1067
01:02:28.950 --> 01:02:30.120
Thank you so much.
Everyone.
