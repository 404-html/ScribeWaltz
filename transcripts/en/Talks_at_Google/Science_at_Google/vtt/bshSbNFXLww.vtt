1
00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:09.650
I give you Steven contract.

2
00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:11.383
<v 1>Okay.</v>

3
00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:18.440
<v 0>Hi everyone.
Thanks for coming out.</v>

4
00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:22.910
Thank you guys for inviting me.
It's good to be back at Google.

5
00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:27.710
I think it's been four or five years since I've been here.
Um,
should,
like I said,

6
00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:29.000
I am an author,

7
00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:32.510
I am a journalist and I'm the CO founder and director of research at the flow

8
00:00:32.511 --> 00:00:34.400
genome project.
And what we studied,

9
00:00:34.401 --> 00:00:38.180
the flow genome project is ultimate human performance or what does it take to be

10
00:00:38.181 --> 00:00:39.650
your best when it matters most.

11
00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.040
And what we're really interested in is what does it take for individuals,

12
00:00:43.041 --> 00:00:43.940
organizations,

13
00:00:43.941 --> 00:00:47.360
sometimes institutions to sort of level up their game like never before.

14
00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.370
What does it take to achieve paradigm shifting breakthroughs?

15
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:51.950
Nothing is ever the same again.
Breakthroughs.

16
00:00:51.951 --> 00:00:55.730
And it kind of in a phrase at the heart of the work that I do is really the

17
00:00:55.731 --> 00:00:57.890
question of what does it take to do the impossible?

18
00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:59.460
And it had a serious level of,

19
00:00:59.461 --> 00:01:03.640
you can sort of get past life verbally built into that question.
And uh,

20
00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:08.300
we are in the middle.
No,
it works.

21
00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:13.100
We are in the middle of kind of a giant revolution in our ability to do the

22
00:01:13.101 --> 00:01:16.280
impossible.
And it's a strange revolution.

23
00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:18.950
It is extremely counter intuitive.

24
00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:24.250
It's overturning a lot of conventional wisdom about high performance and it's

25
00:01:24.441 --> 00:01:28.250
going to be the subject of what I talk about today and it's sort of this

26
00:01:28.251 --> 00:01:31.550
revolution is sitting at the intersection of two smaller revolutions in two

27
00:01:31.551 --> 00:01:32.570
overlapping ones.

28
00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.380
One is a revolution and peak performance that if you've seen my other Google

29
00:01:36.381 --> 00:01:37.340
talks I talked about,

30
00:01:37.341 --> 00:01:40.010
then we're going to cover a little bit of the same ground and the other is a

31
00:01:40.011 --> 00:01:42.830
revolution.
And what will you could call the science of spirituality.

32
00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.850
And I'm using the term spirituality in the most secular possible definition of

33
00:01:46.851 --> 00:01:51.620
the term.
And these two things are colliding and the collision is a really,

34
00:01:51.621 --> 00:01:56.420
really overturning almost everything we knew about human performance.
And um,

35
00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:59.240
as a way of introducing this topic,
I thought I'd start where I started.

36
00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:03.040
I came to the question of how do you accomplish the impossible?

37
00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:05.930
Through a really weird door.
I walked in through the door of journalism.

38
00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:10.700
I became a journalist in the early 1990s and back then,
Action,
Sports,
surfing,

39
00:02:10.701 --> 00:02:12.320
skiing,
rock climbing and whatever,

40
00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.490
getting a lot of attention and the x games were starting the gravity games and

41
00:02:16.491 --> 00:02:21.130
there was a lot of work if you could write and ski and right and rock climb or

42
00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:22.140
right.
And Sir,

43
00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.060
if there was a lot of work and I couldn't do any of those things very well,

44
00:02:26.061 --> 00:02:27.110
but I needed the work.

45
00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:32.300
So I lied to my editors and I was lucky enough to spend about 10 years chasing

46
00:02:32.301 --> 00:02:36.920
professional athletes around mountains and across oceans.
And I will tell you,

47
00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:40.580
if you're not a professional athlete and you spend all your time chasing

48
00:02:40.581 --> 00:02:44.360
professional athletes around mountains and across oceans tend to break things.

49
00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:46.940
I broke a lot of things as you can see.

50
00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.120
And what this meant is I ended up taking a lot of time off,

51
00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.480
so I'd be hanging out at snap this or that and I have to take three months,

52
00:02:53.481 --> 00:02:56.000
four months,
five months off.
And when I came back,

53
00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:01.150
the progress I saw was really amazing.
It was leaps and bounds kind of stuff.

54
00:03:01.151 --> 00:03:04.870
It didn't make any sense.
Stuff that was absolutely impossible,
never been done,

55
00:03:04.871 --> 00:03:08.740
never going to be done just three or four months ago,
wasn't just being done.

56
00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:12.910
It was being iterated upon.
And this caught my attention for a lot of reasons,

57
00:03:12.911 --> 00:03:14.830
but it not just the obvious.

58
00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:18.040
If you go back to the of the 1990s action adventure sport athletes,

59
00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:20.200
we're a rowdy punk,
rock,

60
00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:23.140
irreverent bunch of people without a lot of natural advantages.

61
00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:25.240
So most of the people I knew in this community,

62
00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:26.680
they didn't have a lot of education,

63
00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:31.740
they had very little money and most of them had horrific childhood experiences.

64
00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:36.820
And yet here they were on a like semi-regular basis or reinventing what was

65
00:03:36.821 --> 00:03:40.480
possible for our species,
right?
Expanding the limits of physical possibility.

66
00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:43.210
And I want to know what the hell the hell was this possible,

67
00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:47.230
but I'd also broken about 80 bones at that point and I knew what weight one

68
00:03:47.231 --> 00:03:49.600
example,
sorry,
we'll come back to that one example.

69
00:03:49.601 --> 00:03:50.620
I always forget to give this to.

70
00:03:50.621 --> 00:03:52.330
I want to give you one example of what I was looking at.

71
00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:55.000
If you haven't read rise of Superman or aren't familiar with it.

72
00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:58.150
And if you saw my earlier talking,
I'm repeating myself,
I apologize.

73
00:03:58.151 --> 00:04:00.400
We're going to burn through this stuff and get to the new stuff.

74
00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:05.940
Surfing thousand year old sport 480 to 1996 progress is really slow.

75
00:04:06.431 --> 00:04:10.390
25 feet is the biggest wave anybody can serve above that total impossible.

76
00:04:10.391 --> 00:04:14.020
There are physics papers written about how you can't paddle into a wave of 25

77
00:04:14.021 --> 00:04:16.600
feet.
And as you can see from this slide today,

78
00:04:16.601 --> 00:04:20.380
surfers are routinely paddling into waves that are almost a hundred feet tall in

79
00:04:20.381 --> 00:04:23.920
20 years.
And this was happening all over action sports.

80
00:04:23.921 --> 00:04:27.490
So of course I did want to know what the hell was going on and I also knew that

81
00:04:27.491 --> 00:04:30.040
if I didn't take my question out of action sports and into other domains,

82
00:04:30.041 --> 00:04:34.720
I was going to kill myself.
And so that's what I did and I,
that's what I did.

83
00:04:34.721 --> 00:04:38.020
An in kind of all the next eight of my books and for example,

84
00:04:38.021 --> 00:04:42.010
in tomorrow land that was about those maverick innovators who took Saif in

85
00:04:42.011 --> 00:04:47.011
fiction ideas and turn them into science fact technology I bold was wild

86
00:04:47.821 --> 00:04:51.430
business entrepreneurs.
Your own Larry Page,
Jeff Vasos,
Richard Brandson,

87
00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:53.630
folks like that who had um,

88
00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:57.910
Ilan Moscow had invented incredibly world changing businesses in near record

89
00:04:57.911 --> 00:05:01.720
time against crazy odds.
Uh,
in abundance.

90
00:05:01.721 --> 00:05:05.890
I teamed up with Peter Diamandis who co founded the x prize and Singularity

91
00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:10.780
University and we looked at innovators tackling global impossible global

92
00:05:10.781 --> 00:05:15.280
challenges,
poverty,
water scarcity,
energy scarcity,
and making dense here,
right?

93
00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:16.870
And what we discovered,

94
00:05:16.871 --> 00:05:20.380
what I discovered after all this is it doesn't actually matter where you look,

95
00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:22.120
doesn't matter what domain you look in,

96
00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:25.940
wherever you see people forming at the restaurant ever,

97
00:05:25.941 --> 00:05:27.760
you see people tackling the impossible.

98
00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:31.780
You see a state of consciousness known to researchers as flow,
right?

99
00:05:31.781 --> 00:05:35.260
And you may know flow by lots of other names.
Runner's high,
being in the zone,

100
00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:38.650
the forever box.
If you're a standup comic,
play basketball,

101
00:05:38.651 --> 00:05:43.180
it's being unconscious flows a technical term and is technically defined as an

102
00:05:43.181 --> 00:05:44.440
optimal state of consciousness.

103
00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:49.440
When we feel our best and we perform our best and we're so focused on the task

104
00:05:49.901 --> 00:05:53.530
at hand,
everything else just disappears,
right?
Action and awareness will merge.

105
00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:56.500
Sense of self will vanish,
time will dilate.

106
00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:59.270
Fancy way of saying it passes strangely,
it will slow down.

107
00:05:59.271 --> 00:06:02.600
You've got a freeze frame of that.
As soon as it speeds up and five hours go by,

108
00:06:02.601 --> 00:06:05.750
I'm like five minutes.
And throughout all aspects of performance,

109
00:06:05.751 --> 00:06:08.030
mental and physical go through the roof.

110
00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:14.060
Flow science is really old dates back to like the late 18,
seventies,

111
00:06:14.061 --> 00:06:18.140
18,
eighties,
very birth of kind of what became psychology,

112
00:06:18.141 --> 00:06:19.790
what became caught in a neuroscience.

113
00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:23.690
A lot of this work was being done on peak performance way back then.
Um,

114
00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:29.710
got a huge jump forward in the 1970s and eighties when this guy me,

115
00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:34.430
chick sent me Hi often called the godfather of flow psychology.
Uh,

116
00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:37.940
he was the chairman of the University of Chicago Psychology Department and did a

117
00:06:37.941 --> 00:06:41.450
giant kind of enormous study on Optima psychology,

118
00:06:41.451 --> 00:06:44.830
positive psychology one around the world asking me what the Times in the lives

119
00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:46.700
they felt their best and they perform their best.

120
00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:50.630
And he taught us for really kind of fundamental things about flow.

121
00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:53.780
It's worth than that one.
The first thing is the state is definable.

122
00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:57.440
It's got core characteristics and I named some of these for you a second ago.

123
00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:01.790
Absolute concentration,
the present moment,
the merger of Action Awareness,

124
00:07:01.791 --> 00:07:06.320
the vanishing itself time dilation because it is definable,

125
00:07:06.321 --> 00:07:07.130
it's measurable.

126
00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:11.390
We have really well established psychometric instruments for measuring flow.
Um,

127
00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:14.900
over and over and over and over they've been examined.
They're really solid.

128
00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:19.040
So it's definable and is measurable.
It's also universal check sent me high,

129
00:07:19.041 --> 00:07:22.580
discovered that we are all biologically hardwired for flow.

130
00:07:22.581 --> 00:07:24.680
This is how we perform at our best.

131
00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:29.860
So the state shows up anywhere in anyone provided certain initial conditions are

132
00:07:29.961 --> 00:07:34.640
met.
You also named Flo.
And it's for a very specific reasons.

133
00:07:34.641 --> 00:07:37.430
So when he was running around the world asking people about the times and let

134
00:07:37.431 --> 00:07:40.130
them perform their best,
people say the same thing.
They said,
well,

135
00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:44.720
when I feel this way,
I ended up in a state where every action,

136
00:07:44.721 --> 00:07:49.070
every decision flows seamlessly,
effortlessly,
perfectly from the last.

137
00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:51.560
So flow is a phenomenological description,
right?

138
00:07:51.561 --> 00:07:54.740
It describes how the state makes us feel.
Interestingly,

139
00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:56.900
if you'll look under that phenomenology,

140
00:07:57.080 --> 00:08:01.190
you see something really neat for flow to feel flowy,

141
00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:02.570
very disect dishes,

142
00:08:02.571 --> 00:08:06.520
interaction of proceed from seamlessly and fluidly and African.

143
00:08:06.521 --> 00:08:10.010
Recently from the last you're looking at high speed,

144
00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:14.030
near perfect decision making,
right and near perfect.

145
00:08:14.031 --> 00:08:18.110
I need to emphasize not perfect decision making it all.
That's a fallacy.

146
00:08:18.111 --> 00:08:18.771
Scott Schmidt,

147
00:08:18.771 --> 00:08:23.030
who one of the early extreme skiers had a great phrase flow use to make me feel

148
00:08:23.031 --> 00:08:25.640
like superman up until the moment I'm not.

149
00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:29.760
And key important safety tip when it comes to this stuff.
Um,

150
00:08:29.810 --> 00:08:32.030
the last thing you discovered is that flow is fundamental.

151
00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:36.260
It is fundamental to wellbeing,
to meaning to overall life satisfaction.

152
00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:41.500
When do studies of overall life satisfaction and meaning and wellbeing,

153
00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:45.170
people who have the most flow in their lives or the people who score off the

154
00:08:45.171 --> 00:08:46.180
charts.
Um,

155
00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:51.280
and this is another extremely well established finding in the next question that

156
00:08:52.761 --> 00:08:55.950
people kind of turn their attention to after chickson my highs foundational work

157
00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:59.100
is,
okay,
this is optimal performance.
How often,

158
00:08:59.110 --> 00:09:00.330
what the hell are we talking about?

159
00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:03.270
The answer is pretty optimal in sports and athletics.

160
00:09:03.271 --> 00:09:06.900
We now know that flow pretty much to the heart of any gold medal Vladik

161
00:09:06.930 --> 00:09:11.930
championship that's ever been one significant progress in business or excuse me,

162
00:09:12.271 --> 00:09:14.010
in science and technology.
I said earlier,

163
00:09:14.011 --> 00:09:15.930
I studied paradigm shifting breakthroughs.

164
00:09:16.110 --> 00:09:17.780
Whenever you tend to see paradigm shifting,

165
00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:20.160
breakthroughs in science technology tend to see flow.

166
00:09:20.610 --> 00:09:23.460
Same thing with massive progress in the arts.
In business,

167
00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:25.230
we have some really compelling data.

168
00:09:25.450 --> 00:09:29.280
A Mckinsey took a look at flow and the peak performance and they found that

169
00:09:29.310 --> 00:09:33.450
after a long study that top executives report being five times more productive

170
00:09:33.451 --> 00:09:37.740
in flow.
That's 500% more productive or at that means you go to work on Monday,

171
00:09:37.741 --> 00:09:40.830
spend Monday in a flow state and take Tuesday through Friday off and get the

172
00:09:40.831 --> 00:09:43.470
same amount done.
I had two days a week and flow.

173
00:09:43.650 --> 00:09:47.550
And you're 1000% more productive than the competition.
And I will tell you,

174
00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:49.710
even though we're not going to talk about business at all,

175
00:09:49.711 --> 00:09:52.950
I will say my organization,
a lot of other organizations,

176
00:09:52.951 --> 00:09:55.590
we're training up a lot of different organizations,
including you guys.

177
00:09:55.591 --> 00:09:59.010
And we'll talk about the work we did with you guys at Google a little bit later.

178
00:09:59.310 --> 00:10:00.143
But,
uh,

179
00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:04.080
what I wonder is when you look at those numbers and those numbers are pretty

180
00:10:04.081 --> 00:10:08.130
solid,
um,
how they hell do you keep up if you're not doing this stuff?

181
00:10:08.131 --> 00:10:10.860
That's just an open question.
We're not going to linger there.

182
00:10:11.190 --> 00:10:14.460
The next thing that happened kind of after we figured out that flow is at the

183
00:10:14.461 --> 00:10:18.930
heart of all this optimal performance is there's been a revolution in

184
00:10:18.931 --> 00:10:20.950
neuroscience,
right?
Um,

185
00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:25.170
biotechnology right now is moving at five times the speed of Moore's law,
right?

186
00:10:25.180 --> 00:10:27.720
And he's doubling the power of roughly every four months.

187
00:10:27.721 --> 00:10:31.350
And it is dragging neuroscience along in his dragon flow science long.

188
00:10:31.351 --> 00:10:34.830
And this is by the way,
one example of a flow research.

189
00:10:34.831 --> 00:10:38.250
So this is an experiment designed by Baylor Stanford neuroscientist,

190
00:10:38.251 --> 00:10:41.150
David Eagleman back when he was at Baylor.
And uh,

191
00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:43.180
I've been hoisted 150 feet into a circus.

192
00:10:43.470 --> 00:10:46.620
I'm wearing a perceptual chronometer on my wrist and we're trying to figure out

193
00:10:46.621 --> 00:10:49.380
why time passes a strangely and flows.
So I've been dropped,

194
00:10:49.530 --> 00:10:53.580
I'm free falling 150 feet and trying to keep track of time and I will tell you,

195
00:10:53.581 --> 00:10:56.280
we did make some progress on that question.
I'll talk about that in a second.

196
00:10:56.760 --> 00:10:58.470
It also like six and a half months,

197
00:10:58.471 --> 00:11:00.900
a chiropractic work til I could walk straight.
So,

198
00:11:00.930 --> 00:11:04.110
so I want you to know that like I suffered for this information.
People,

199
00:11:04.290 --> 00:11:05.940
that's all I'm saying.
Um,

200
00:11:06.210 --> 00:11:09.690
so what we've learned in a lot of this new neuroscience is that our old ideas

201
00:11:09.691 --> 00:11:12.330
about high performance and things exactly backwards,

202
00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:15.950
the old idea that you guys are familiar with,
it's this so called 10% brain myth.

203
00:11:15.951 --> 00:11:20.130
This is the idea that it a one time we'd use a small portion of our brain,

204
00:11:20.250 --> 00:11:22.710
say 10%,
right?
So flow,

205
00:11:22.711 --> 00:11:26.250
Aka ultimate performance must be the full brand on overdrive,
right?

206
00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:30.480
Turns out we had it exactly backwards inflow.

207
00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:33.390
We're not using more of the brand,
we're using less technical term,

208
00:11:33.450 --> 00:11:37.200
transient hypofrontality,
transient meaning temporary hypo,

209
00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:40.080
the opposite of hyper h.
Y p.
O it means to slow down,

210
00:11:40.081 --> 00:11:44.010
to shutdown to he and fatalities.
This part of the brand,
that prefrontal Cortex,

211
00:11:44.011 --> 00:11:47.130
right?
The portion of your brand that has a lot of your executive functions,

212
00:11:47.131 --> 00:11:50.550
higher cognitive functions,
complex logical decision making,

213
00:11:50.551 --> 00:11:53.270
your sense of morality or sense of will,
longterm planning.

214
00:11:53.271 --> 00:11:55.960
And this is all pre frontal cortex to burns off in flow.

215
00:11:56.230 --> 00:11:58.690
It's an efficiency exchange.
Um,

216
00:11:59.290 --> 00:12:03.820
but as a result we see some really cool things for performance.

217
00:12:03.821 --> 00:12:07.540
For example,
what happens when your prefrontal cortex turns off?
Well,

218
00:12:07.570 --> 00:12:08.860
that's what happens to time.

219
00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:12.730
Time is actually a calculation performed by a bunch of different structures all

220
00:12:12.731 --> 00:12:15.970
over the prefrontal cortex.
And when starts them start to wink out,

221
00:12:15.971 --> 00:12:20.200
we can't separate past from present and future were plunged into this space.

222
00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:23.980
People talk about as the eternal present,
the elongated now the deep now.

223
00:12:24.170 --> 00:12:26.590
All right,
so that's why time passes a stranger than flow.

224
00:12:26.770 --> 00:12:30.610
Huge impact on performance.
Why?
Most of our fears,

225
00:12:30.670 --> 00:12:33.310
stuff we're scared about is either horrible stuff that happened in the past that

226
00:12:33.311 --> 00:12:35.380
we'd like to avoid happening in the present,
right?

227
00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:38.740
Or it's scary stuff that might happen in the future and we'd like to avoid from

228
00:12:38.741 --> 00:12:42.970
the present,
right?
But right here,
right now,
unless you're facing mortal Kombat,

229
00:12:43.030 --> 00:12:45.400
there's not a whole hell of a lot to be afraid of,
right?

230
00:12:45.401 --> 00:12:50.310
So when we drop into flow and drop into this deep now anxiety,
plumbing,

231
00:12:50.311 --> 00:12:52.240
stress hormones literally leave our system.

232
00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:55.870
Same thing happens to your sense of self.
Self is a network effect.

233
00:12:55.871 --> 00:12:58.690
It's produced by a bunch of different structures in the prefrontal cortex.

234
00:12:58.691 --> 00:13:02.020
Couple of other parts of the brain talking to each other.
Like any network,
right?

235
00:13:02.021 --> 00:13:05.110
A bunch of nodes start collapsing,
haul network goes down,

236
00:13:05.111 --> 00:13:09.850
we lose our ability to create our sense of,
again,
huge impact on performance.

237
00:13:10.150 --> 00:13:12.850
When our self goes away,
our inner critic,

238
00:13:13.060 --> 00:13:16.810
that nagging always on to feed his voice in your head,
it goes away as well,

239
00:13:17.110 --> 00:13:18.490
right?
So what do we see?

240
00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:22.750
Risk taking goes up creativity because you're no longer doubting all year need

241
00:13:22.751 --> 00:13:27.190
ideas goes through the roof and we experienced this as liberation freedom.

242
00:13:27.310 --> 00:13:31.300
We are literally getting out of our own way simultaneously.

243
00:13:31.660 --> 00:13:35.950
We see a big shift in brainwaves.
Normally where we are right now,

244
00:13:35.951 --> 00:13:39.170
you're all in Beta.
It's a fast moving brainwave,
right?
It's where we are.

245
00:13:39.171 --> 00:13:40.420
We're paying attention,
we're awake.

246
00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:44.860
Alert flow actually takes place on the border.
That in between Alpha and data,

247
00:13:45.250 --> 00:13:47.770
these are much slower waves.
Alpha is daydreaming.

248
00:13:47.771 --> 00:13:51.490
Mode is the brain from going from idea to idea without a lot of internal risks,

249
00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:52.151
existence,

250
00:13:52.151 --> 00:13:55.960
it's often the signature brainwave for creativity though that research needs

251
00:13:55.961 --> 00:13:57.210
more work.
Um,

252
00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:02.380
Feta is where we are in rem sleep is the hypnogogic state.

253
00:14:02.381 --> 00:14:04.660
So instead of moving from thought to thought without a lot of resistance,

254
00:14:04.661 --> 00:14:07.840
there's zero resistance.
The green turtle becomes the green sweater,

255
00:14:07.841 --> 00:14:09.460
becomes the green planet,
right?

256
00:14:09.670 --> 00:14:11.950
So they haven't got to get to flow is on the borderline.

257
00:14:12.250 --> 00:14:16.630
Now what's interesting about this particular borderline is also when you're in

258
00:14:16.631 --> 00:14:19.960
theta,
you also get another way of called gamma.
It's a very fast,

259
00:14:19.961 --> 00:14:23.830
sharp spiking wave.
It is the signature of the Aha moment.

260
00:14:23.980 --> 00:14:28.180
Gamma only shows up in the brain when the brain is combining new ideas together

261
00:14:28.181 --> 00:14:30.610
for the first time.
It's what's known as binding,
right?

262
00:14:30.611 --> 00:14:34.600
It's what's the signature of the Aha moment?
Gammon,
they'd are coupled waves,

263
00:14:35.110 --> 00:14:37.450
which means you can only get one with the other.

264
00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:41.740
So what this technically means is from a creativity boosting perspective,

265
00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:45.880
flow puts you on the edge of Aha insight at all times.

266
00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:49.330
If you're really want to understand how flow helps us to do the impossible,

267
00:14:49.570 --> 00:14:51.310
you need to know that the state cocktails,

268
00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:55.310
five of the most potent neurochemicals the brain can produce,
right?

269
00:14:55.311 --> 00:14:57.590
Flow appears to be the only time we get all five at once.

270
00:14:57.860 --> 00:15:01.220
All of these boost physical performance,
right?

271
00:15:01.221 --> 00:15:04.280
They speed up muscle reaction times,
increased strength,

272
00:15:04.820 --> 00:15:08.840
increased dexterity,
lower our threshold.
Haydn,
our threshold,
the pain.

273
00:15:09.050 --> 00:15:09.801
More important.

274
00:15:09.801 --> 00:15:13.270
If you really want to know how they impact our ability to tackle impossible

275
00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:17.600
problems,
it's their impact on the three sides of the high call,

276
00:15:17.630 --> 00:15:20.450
what I call the high performance Congo.
This is motivation,

277
00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:22.220
learning and creativity.

278
00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:26.030
And I'm going to sort of break them down one at a time for you.

279
00:15:26.031 --> 00:15:29.900
Cause I think it's critical.
Most of motivation goes through the roof and flow.

280
00:15:30.230 --> 00:15:33.320
Why?
Besides being performance in Hanson Chemicals,

281
00:15:33.321 --> 00:15:37.840
the five chemicals that show up in flow are all pleasure drugs.
In fact,

282
00:15:37.841 --> 00:15:41.780
of the five most potent pleasure drugs the brand can produce and flow gives you

283
00:15:41.781 --> 00:15:44.690
all five at once.
It is a huge high.

284
00:15:44.870 --> 00:15:49.870
So when Mckinsey finds the top executives or 500% more productive in flow,

285
00:15:50.690 --> 00:15:55.160
it's addictive neurochemistry that's underneath that you'd spike and creativity.

286
00:15:55.161 --> 00:15:58.250
But it's why psychologists talk about flow is the store's code of intrinsic

287
00:15:58.251 --> 00:16:01.610
motivation.
We see some least similar with creativity.

288
00:16:01.820 --> 00:16:05.120
So we've made a lot of progress recently and kind of the neuroscience of

289
00:16:05.121 --> 00:16:09.230
creativity.
And one of the things we,
we always know it a really simple level.

290
00:16:09.231 --> 00:16:11.120
It's always a common detory process.

291
00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:14.870
It's what happens when the brain takes and novel information combines it with

292
00:16:14.871 --> 00:16:18.710
older ideas to create something startlingly new flow.

293
00:16:18.711 --> 00:16:21.890
And these neurochemicals more specifically surround that process.

294
00:16:21.891 --> 00:16:25.340
So when we're in flow,
we take in more information per second.

295
00:16:25.341 --> 00:16:29.210
So data acquisition goes up,
we pay more attention to that incoming information.

296
00:16:29.210 --> 00:16:30.560
So salient goes up,

297
00:16:30.980 --> 00:16:34.430
we find faster connections between that incoming information and older ideas.

298
00:16:34.431 --> 00:16:38.210
So pattern recognition goes up kind of farther flung connections between that

299
00:16:38.211 --> 00:16:41.090
incoming information and all their ideas.
So lateral thinking goes up.

300
00:16:41.390 --> 00:16:46.250
And then since creativity also requires you to take your cool innovative idea

301
00:16:46.251 --> 00:16:49.040
and make it public right on the back end of the whole thing,

302
00:16:49.041 --> 00:16:52.130
we see risk taking spike,
I'm in flow.

303
00:16:52.131 --> 00:16:54.830
So flow sort of surrounds the creative process,

304
00:16:54.831 --> 00:16:58.460
which is why in studies or in by my organization,
the flow genome project,

305
00:16:58.461 --> 00:17:01.340
some stuff done at Harvard and some stuff done at the University of Sydney.

306
00:17:01.580 --> 00:17:06.580
We see creativity and flow spikes and 400 and 700% and that sounds like a huge

307
00:17:06.771 --> 00:17:10.310
spike.
It's crazy.
Uh,
we just finished a big creativity study,

308
00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:12.620
got some interesting data and I'm going to talk about it later,

309
00:17:12.621 --> 00:17:14.660
but for now we'll just stop there.

310
00:17:14.660 --> 00:17:17.630
But that spike is not out of line.

311
00:17:17.631 --> 00:17:20.390
And what we see with productivity and nor is it outline what we see with

312
00:17:20.391 --> 00:17:24.950
learning.
Learning also has a huge impact.
These neurochemicals,

313
00:17:24.980 --> 00:17:27.350
quick shorthand for how learning and memory work in the brain.

314
00:17:27.830 --> 00:17:30.080
More neuro chemicals that show up during experience,

315
00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:33.320
better chance that experience is going to move from short term holding to

316
00:17:33.321 --> 00:17:37.790
longterm storage flows.
A huge neurochemical spike.
All right.
As a result,

317
00:17:37.791 --> 00:17:41.780
studies run by the dod and our friends at advanced brain monitoring found that

318
00:17:41.781 --> 00:17:46.610
soldiers and flow can learn 430% faster than normal.

319
00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:48.260
Huge number again.

320
00:17:48.470 --> 00:17:52.080
And what it suggest is like we've all heard about the temp fabled 10,000 hours

321
00:17:52.081 --> 00:17:55.600
to mastery,
which are not accurate,
but that's besides the point.
Um,

322
00:17:56.190 --> 00:17:59.610
what the research does show is that flow can cut them in half.

323
00:17:59.860 --> 00:18:01.200
And all of this is amazing.

324
00:18:01.230 --> 00:18:04.770
All of this is kind of the foundation for the revolution and high performance.

325
00:18:04.770 --> 00:18:06.760
We're going to come back to this stuff in a minute,
but I,

326
00:18:07.090 --> 00:18:11.550
I want to jump and jump towards the second half and I want to retell you the

327
00:18:11.551 --> 00:18:16.170
same story.
Cup few different players from a different perspective.

328
00:18:16.171 --> 00:18:18.600
I lied you earlier when I said it was going to be about the science and

329
00:18:18.601 --> 00:18:19.434
spirituality.

330
00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:22.740
It's really going to be more technically about the science of mystical

331
00:18:22.741 --> 00:18:27.360
experiences and that science also dates back to roughly the same person.

332
00:18:27.570 --> 00:18:30.660
William James.
All right,
we're going to talk in a retail the same story.

333
00:18:30.661 --> 00:18:33.480
William James was not just interested in flow.

334
00:18:33.660 --> 00:18:37.410
He was interested in essentially the entire ecstatic spectrum.

335
00:18:37.411 --> 00:18:42.411
These are all the experiences at the kind of upper range of human experience.

336
00:18:42.511 --> 00:18:46.290
Flow states,
states of awe,
trance states,

337
00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:50.930
meditative states,
contemplatives states,
psychedelic states.
Um,

338
00:18:51.660 --> 00:18:55.050
back then,
by the way,
flow was treated as a mystical experience.

339
00:18:55.050 --> 00:18:58.770
James wrote about it.
He pointed out that it has a huge impact on performance,

340
00:18:58.980 --> 00:19:00.660
but he thought it was a mystical experience.

341
00:19:00.661 --> 00:19:03.000
That's what he thought he was looking at.
Um,

342
00:19:03.330 --> 00:19:05.820
and William James was looking at all of these experiences,

343
00:19:05.821 --> 00:19:09.900
sort of what's known as the Ecstatics,
bactrim.
And he said,
wow,
you know,

344
00:19:11.070 --> 00:19:13.860
whatever you feel about the context,
right?

345
00:19:13.861 --> 00:19:17.550
They may come out of religious traditions,
they may be spiritual.
He said,

346
00:19:17.551 --> 00:19:20.580
that's fine,
but if you would get past that and you look at the data,

347
00:19:20.581 --> 00:19:24.330
the data shows you three things.
It says that all of these states,

348
00:19:25.050 --> 00:19:28.660
interestingly,
they all make you feel roughly the same.
And we'll go,

349
00:19:28.661 --> 00:19:32.250
we'll come back to that in a second.
But there phenomenologically very similar.

350
00:19:32.580 --> 00:19:34.890
They all seem to impact performance.

351
00:19:35.190 --> 00:19:40.140
And even though they may be based on religions that I as a scientist don't

352
00:19:40.141 --> 00:19:43.890
believe in,
they have psychologically real impacts.

353
00:19:43.890 --> 00:19:47.880
People on the other side of these experiences are definitely different.

354
00:19:48.210 --> 00:19:50.670
They lives are more meaningful,
they're more fulfilled.

355
00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:53.670
And for those reasons alone,
you have to take them seriously.

356
00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:56.910
Freud came along and said,
no,
we don't.
Not at all.

357
00:19:56.911 --> 00:19:59.960
We're not going to take those ideas seriously.
You're out of your mind for,

358
00:20:00.060 --> 00:20:02.130
you know,
when we agreed with Mark's,

359
00:20:02.131 --> 00:20:04.380
he thought religion was the opiate of the masses.

360
00:20:04.381 --> 00:20:07.860
He wanted nothing to do with it and more importantly for I'd said,
no,
no,
no,

361
00:20:07.861 --> 00:20:11.310
psychology is about solving pathological problems.

362
00:20:11.311 --> 00:20:14.430
We are not interested in psychological positive possibilities.

363
00:20:14.610 --> 00:20:15.660
That's not what we do here.

364
00:20:17.430 --> 00:20:22.050
Flow got away with it because in the 1950s Abraham Maslow who is also back on

365
00:20:22.051 --> 00:20:27.051
this list was studying success and he found flow in a as as this kind of giant

366
00:20:29.971 --> 00:20:32.550
secret to success and everybody who was doing the studying outward,

367
00:20:32.551 --> 00:20:35.400
Einstein and Eleanor Roosevelt and people like that wanting to know how they

368
00:20:35.401 --> 00:20:40.110
achieve what they had achieved and they all found ways to produce flow and use

369
00:20:40.111 --> 00:20:43.740
it to amplify performance.
But everybody in his study group was an atheist.

370
00:20:43.980 --> 00:20:45.630
So mystical experiences,

371
00:20:45.631 --> 00:20:49.630
what James called it when I was out and peak experiences was with more secular

372
00:20:49.631 --> 00:20:52.360
term that Maslow,
you would just,
and that's when the split occurred,

373
00:20:52.630 --> 00:20:56.740
but there was another lineage which was the science of spirituality and it

374
00:20:56.741 --> 00:21:01.420
didn't really do much.
But in the 1950s this guy,
this is wilder Penfield,

375
00:21:01.660 --> 00:21:05.290
he is one of the great neurosurgeons in the 20th century.

376
00:21:05.460 --> 00:21:10.150
It was an epilepsy expert expert and back in the 1950s he was doing all these

377
00:21:10.151 --> 00:21:13.510
experiments where all these procedures where he would open up people's brain,

378
00:21:13.750 --> 00:21:16.270
brain,
skull and which you can do,
um,

379
00:21:16.290 --> 00:21:18.910
it's not a whole lot of nerves there so you can do with local anesthetic and

380
00:21:18.911 --> 00:21:22.870
keep people awake and he was stimulating different portions of people's brains

381
00:21:22.990 --> 00:21:26.770
in epileptics trying to produce not a seizure but an aura,

382
00:21:26.771 --> 00:21:31.771
which is what it's often a violent shift in perception that precedes a seizure.

383
00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:35.010
Um,
people will see colors or smells,

384
00:21:35.260 --> 00:21:37.360
smell of burnt toast is really common anyways,

385
00:21:37.540 --> 00:21:39.760
going through people's brains trying to produce these reactions.

386
00:21:39.761 --> 00:21:44.260
Once he found a spot,
he would scoop it out.
And that was certain brain surgery,

387
00:21:44.261 --> 00:21:45.160
right?
For epilepsy.

388
00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:48.710
But when he started stimulating people's right temporal lobe and the plate,

389
00:21:48.790 --> 00:21:51.370
the temporal parietal junction where those lobes coming together,

390
00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:55.000
weird stuff started to happen.
People that out of body experiences,

391
00:21:55.001 --> 00:21:59.920
p bull herd visions,
they had hallucinations,
they had sense presence,

392
00:21:59.921 --> 00:22:03.040
which is the peeling of a god or a ghost or a demon in the room with them.

393
00:22:03.310 --> 00:22:05.980
And for the first time somebody went,
hey,
wait a minute,

394
00:22:06.070 --> 00:22:09.520
there's biology underneath our mythology,
whatever else is going on,

395
00:22:09.521 --> 00:22:12.790
there's biology there now.
Real Science of course,

396
00:22:12.791 --> 00:22:17.791
doesn't study this stuff and they didn't until this man Andy Newberg came along

397
00:22:19.721 --> 00:22:24.721
in the late 1990s and Andy is an incredibly brave man who risked his career to

398
00:22:24.941 --> 00:22:29.140
ask a really interesting question and he was really interested in consciousness

399
00:22:29.141 --> 00:22:32.710
who was the University of Pennsylvania and he felt that if you were interested

400
00:22:32.711 --> 00:22:33.371
in consciousness,

401
00:22:33.371 --> 00:22:38.050
you absolutely had to account for the phenomenon known as unity or cosmic unity

402
00:22:38.170 --> 00:22:39.760
becoming one with everything.

403
00:22:40.180 --> 00:22:44.080
And the reason you have to account for it is oneness with everything shows up in

404
00:22:44.140 --> 00:22:46.030
every single mystical tradition on earth.

405
00:22:46.031 --> 00:22:49.750
It's an every religion honor and it's there long before there's mass

406
00:22:49.751 --> 00:22:50.584
communication.

407
00:22:50.770 --> 00:22:54.640
So if it's everywhere and it's there before there's mass communication,

408
00:22:54.730 --> 00:22:58.330
there's probably biology under neath it because it doesn't seem like the whole

409
00:22:58.331 --> 00:23:02.320
world is having a mass hallucination.
Right?
It doesn't make sense.
Right.

410
00:23:02.321 --> 00:23:03.700
So there's probably some biology there.

411
00:23:03.701 --> 00:23:06.460
He wanted to know what is the biology and he took a look.
He,

412
00:23:06.461 --> 00:23:10.840
so he took a bunch of Tibetan Buddhists and a bunch of Franciscan nuns who both

413
00:23:10.841 --> 00:23:14.620
experience absolute unity through their meditation practices.
For the nuns.

414
00:23:14.621 --> 00:23:18.400
It's Hooni a mystical oneness with Jesus,
his love for the Buddhists.

415
00:23:18.430 --> 00:23:21.610
It's absolute unitary being oneness with the universe.
Right.

416
00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:25.690
And what he discovered is more hypofrontality but not quite.

417
00:23:25.990 --> 00:23:29.440
What he discovered is this portion of the brain down here,

418
00:23:29.560 --> 00:23:33.280
it's not as the orientation area gets very,
very quiet.

419
00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:36.760
It's another efficiency exchange in the same way the prefrontal cortex and runs

420
00:23:36.761 --> 00:23:39.160
off.
And this portion of the brain is the right parietal lobe.

421
00:23:39.161 --> 00:23:43.660
It's right at the temporal parietal junction,
right at the same spot.
Wilder,

422
00:23:43.661 --> 00:23:48.661
Penfield noticed all this activity and what Newburgh discovered is this portion

423
00:23:49.251 --> 00:23:50.890
of the brand,
by the way,
um,

424
00:23:50.990 --> 00:23:54.350
he calls it the orientation area cause it helps us orientate ourselves in space.

425
00:23:54.351 --> 00:23:57.790
What it does is it basically there was a boundary around the body and says,

426
00:23:57.860 --> 00:23:59.000
at this point,

427
00:23:59.270 --> 00:24:02.450
this is where you end and the rest of the world begins and you need this

428
00:24:02.451 --> 00:24:02.841
boundaries.

429
00:24:02.841 --> 00:24:06.320
You can walk across a crowded room without bumping into people or people who

430
00:24:06.321 --> 00:24:08.240
have a stroke or brain damage to this area.

431
00:24:08.241 --> 00:24:11.450
They can't sit down on a couch because they're not quite sure where their leg

432
00:24:11.451 --> 00:24:16.190
ends in.
The couch begins during intense concentration in meditation.

433
00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:20.390
When the brain needs extra energy fo focus,
it takes it away from this area.

434
00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:25.600
This area shuts down no energy and no energy out as a result because you can no

435
00:24:26.421 --> 00:24:28.200
longer separate from self,
self from other.

436
00:24:28.201 --> 00:24:31.190
The brain includes has to conclude at this particular moment,

437
00:24:31.191 --> 00:24:32.810
you're one with anything,
everything.

438
00:24:33.500 --> 00:24:38.150
So this is where the stories come back together in the Uber did this research in

439
00:24:38.151 --> 00:24:43.151
the early two thousands I was at that point studying surfers who were doing

440
00:24:44.331 --> 00:24:47.660
amazing things and they kept coming to me saying,
hey man,
when I'm out there,

441
00:24:47.661 --> 00:24:48.620
when I'm surfing a tube,

442
00:24:48.621 --> 00:24:53.621
I am one with the ocean and it kept happening and I was a surfer and I knew what

443
00:24:54.501 --> 00:24:57.860
they were talking about because I had had that experience and I just wrote about

444
00:24:57.890 --> 00:25:01.220
wrote it off and never talked about it out loud cause what could be flaky and

445
00:25:01.221 --> 00:25:03.680
then a surfer running around talking about being one with the ocean.
Right.

446
00:25:03.681 --> 00:25:07.910
It's terrible.
And yet it was all over the place.

447
00:25:07.940 --> 00:25:11.590
Everywhere in surfing and we're going to doctor Newburgh and I Sandy,

448
00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:14.270
is it possible we're looking at the same thing.

449
00:25:14.450 --> 00:25:17.780
Could the oneness with everything the servers are looking at be the one that's

450
00:25:17.781 --> 00:25:18.231
with everything.

451
00:25:18.231 --> 00:25:21.620
The Buddhists are looking at the concentration and we did some work on it and

452
00:25:21.621 --> 00:25:23.930
thought about it a lot.
And the answer is yes,
of course,

453
00:25:23.931 --> 00:25:26.750
the amount of concentration you need to ride a wave as the same amount of

454
00:25:26.751 --> 00:25:29.650
concentration you need for prayer and meditation.
Um,

455
00:25:29.780 --> 00:25:33.110
now it seems so obvious back then,
it was a big step forward.

456
00:25:34.040 --> 00:25:38.360
It was also the first of a bunch of step forwards along similar lines.

457
00:25:38.510 --> 00:25:40.670
So over the past 20 years,

458
00:25:40.671 --> 00:25:44.210
neurotheology since Dr Newburg discovered oneness with everything,

459
00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:48.140
we have looked at pretty much every elder's date you can possibly imagine,

460
00:25:48.290 --> 00:25:50.720
and every so-called mystical state you can possible.

461
00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:55.720
Imagine prayer states contemplate if states states of all trans states,

462
00:25:55.820 --> 00:25:57.560
psychedelic states,
et Cetera,
et cetera.

463
00:25:57.770 --> 00:26:01.010
And what we discovered is that William James was totally right.
I mean,

464
00:26:01.011 --> 00:26:05.990
he was so ahead of his time.
It was crazy from a neurological perspective,

465
00:26:05.991 --> 00:26:09.350
from a phenomenological perspective,
all these states,

466
00:26:09.351 --> 00:26:10.450
and these are some weird states.

467
00:26:10.610 --> 00:26:15.610
So what you're saying is a surfer inflow riding a wave is experiencing the same

468
00:26:16.041 --> 00:26:17.160
thing as a Zen Buddhists.

469
00:26:17.161 --> 00:26:22.161
Meditating in a monastery is experiencing the same thing as somebody at burning

470
00:26:22.281 --> 00:26:25.550
man on a psychedelic.
That's pretty odd.

471
00:26:25.820 --> 00:26:27.530
But that is exactly,
it.

472
00:26:27.531 --> 00:26:31.840
Turns out what we seem to be discovering neuro,

473
00:26:31.841 --> 00:26:35.600
the neuro biological,
this entire ecstatic spectrum.
We see the same three things,

474
00:26:35.810 --> 00:26:37.800
right?
We see the prefrontal cortex deactivate.

475
00:26:38.060 --> 00:26:40.640
And then if the state is really intense,

476
00:26:40.760 --> 00:26:44.250
we see activation and deactivation at the temporal parietal junction.

477
00:26:44.580 --> 00:26:48.000
We see brainwaves dropped down to the Alpha Theta borderline and we see some

478
00:26:48.001 --> 00:26:51.340
combination of these big five neuro chemicals.

479
00:26:52.980 --> 00:26:57.300
We also see a lot of phenomenological over them.
All of these states,

480
00:26:57.740 --> 00:26:59.970
it doesn't matter if we're talking meditative states,
states of Oss,

481
00:26:59.971 --> 00:27:01.080
I get Alec States,

482
00:27:01.110 --> 00:27:05.600
flow states selfless is consistent in all of them by the way.
Uh,

483
00:27:05.820 --> 00:27:10.050
to get it this list,
um,
I should back up a,
I wrote,
uh,
stealing fire,

484
00:27:10.051 --> 00:27:12.960
which is the book that I'm talking about with my partner Jamie wheal and the

485
00:27:12.961 --> 00:27:13.830
flow genome project.

486
00:27:14.070 --> 00:27:18.300
And one of the bits of research that we did is everybody and their mother from

487
00:27:18.301 --> 00:27:22.480
William James Forward hasn't altered a way of defining alders dates and measure

488
00:27:22.481 --> 00:27:24.240
melter states and thinking about all the dates.

489
00:27:24.630 --> 00:27:27.780
And the problem with most of them is they're very context dependent.

490
00:27:28.020 --> 00:27:32.100
So when Buddhist talk about what they experienced in meditation or in trance,

491
00:27:32.220 --> 00:27:34.170
you get very Buddhist interpretations.

492
00:27:34.350 --> 00:27:36.630
And the same thing with Christians and blah blah.

493
00:27:36.900 --> 00:27:39.840
If you go back to the 60s and even if you were dealing with like sixties

494
00:27:39.841 --> 00:27:43.320
psychologists,
there was all kinds of rebirthing stuff coming up.

495
00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:46.650
So you have versions of altered states spectrums that have Neil Natal,

496
00:27:46.660 --> 00:27:50.550
this and that,
and we wanted something that was context independent.

497
00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:54.450
We're just interested in how it makes you feel,
how it shifts feelings.

498
00:27:54.660 --> 00:27:57.160
And that's it.
And this is what we've come up with.
Um,

499
00:27:57.240 --> 00:28:00.690
it has not completely validated.
We've run it by tons of researchers.

500
00:28:00.691 --> 00:28:03.720
A lot of people find it very,
very useful,
has not been validated.

501
00:28:03.721 --> 00:28:06.180
There may be something we're missing,
but we're certain about this stuff,

502
00:28:06.570 --> 00:28:07.261
selflessness,

503
00:28:07.261 --> 00:28:10.070
because the prefrontal cortex turns off timelessness because the prefrontal

504
00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:15.060
cortex turns off.
Effortlessness is this feeling in mystical experiences.

505
00:28:15.061 --> 00:28:19.320
We talk about this as being propelled by gods are ghosts are forces beyond our

506
00:28:19.321 --> 00:28:23.190
control.
And in flow we talk about this as effortless effort,
right?

507
00:28:23.191 --> 00:28:26.490
And what it really is,
is it's five of the most addictive neurochemicals.

508
00:28:26.610 --> 00:28:30.450
The brand can produce showing up in your system and making things feel amazing

509
00:28:30.451 --> 00:28:31.770
and you obviously want more of it.

510
00:28:31.980 --> 00:28:36.210
And the richness refers to information richness.
And the idea is quite simple.

511
00:28:36.390 --> 00:28:38.550
I used the same way that creativity is amplified.

512
00:28:38.551 --> 00:28:42.060
It's amplified in all these states because all these states surround the

513
00:28:42.061 --> 00:28:47.061
creative process and amplify and we get lots and lots of data and we're seeing

514
00:28:48.510 --> 00:28:50.280
this is where the revolutions come together.

515
00:28:50.490 --> 00:28:52.800
We're actually seeing both sides of the coin.

516
00:28:52.801 --> 00:28:56.010
So Freud said psychology has to be about curing the SEC.

517
00:28:56.580 --> 00:29:01.140
And that's what we're seeing and we're seeing because the states are very,

518
00:29:01.141 --> 00:29:03.450
very similar because they're neuro,
biologically similar.

519
00:29:03.570 --> 00:29:04.800
There's similar in impact.

520
00:29:04.801 --> 00:29:08.190
So I want to talk about what we're seeing in PTSD research.

521
00:29:08.370 --> 00:29:12.750
So I said earlier that flow can be useful treating anxiety because it resets the

522
00:29:12.751 --> 00:29:13.381
nervous system.

523
00:29:13.381 --> 00:29:18.381
PTSD is the most extreme anxiety disorder we have and we suck at treating it

524
00:29:18.930 --> 00:29:22.890
generally,
right?
SSRI is the only kind of known treatment for Ptsd.

525
00:29:22.980 --> 00:29:26.880
25 million Americans,
by the way,
are suffering PTSD at any one time.

526
00:29:26.940 --> 00:29:30.830
So it's an epidemic,
right?
And all we've got for them as Sris,

527
00:29:30.990 --> 00:29:32.880
which a you have to take for the rest of your life,

528
00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:37.080
be they don't work on everyone and there's a ton of treatment resistant

529
00:29:37.081 --> 00:29:41.090
depression and PTSD.
They rarely work in women.
Um,

530
00:29:41.210 --> 00:29:45.430
they're not great drugs.
So about 10 years ago,

531
00:29:45.490 --> 00:29:49.690
Rick Doblin and the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Research said,

532
00:29:49.691 --> 00:29:52.450
hey,
let's try psychedelic therapy now.

533
00:29:52.451 --> 00:29:57.250
Psychedelic therapy combines a psychedelic and talk therapy,
right,

534
00:29:57.370 --> 00:29:58.121
blends it together.

535
00:29:58.121 --> 00:30:02.470
And they tried to Mtma therapy on soldiers returning from Afghanistan and Iraq

536
00:30:02.471 --> 00:30:06.130
with PTSD,
victims of child abuse and victims of sexual abuse.

537
00:30:06.340 --> 00:30:11.080
And what they discovered is one to three sessions of p of Mtma therapy.

538
00:30:11.290 --> 00:30:14.890
So using the same psychedelic Mtma that's inside of ecstasy or Molly

539
00:30:16.750 --> 00:30:21.190
was enough to significantly reduce or completely cure PTSD.

540
00:30:21.790 --> 00:30:26.790
And it's been six years since of studies have been run and we know that it's

541
00:30:27.281 --> 00:30:31.570
persistent,
it stays gone.
Nobody's had to go back from further treatments.

542
00:30:31.990 --> 00:30:36.520
So exciting is this to the FDA that they've fast tracked Mgma as a treatment for

543
00:30:36.521 --> 00:30:37.354
PTSD.

544
00:30:37.420 --> 00:30:40.780
And we're going to see it's already in phase three trials and we're going to see

545
00:30:40.781 --> 00:30:43.810
it as a medicine by 2020.
In fact,

546
00:30:43.811 --> 00:30:48.700
the FDA was so impressed with MDM and its ability to treat PTSD that they're now

547
00:30:48.701 --> 00:30:53.160
looking at it as a treatment for regular depression and anxiety.
Um,

548
00:30:53.170 --> 00:30:54.640
so that is moving forward.

549
00:30:55.120 --> 00:30:59.400
Not everybody wants to do with psychedelic to deal with their PTSD.
Okay.

550
00:30:59.410 --> 00:31:01.510
Said the dod at Camp Pendleton,

551
00:31:01.690 --> 00:31:05.530
they rerun the exact same study this time they swapped out the psychedelic,

552
00:31:05.531 --> 00:31:08.410
they put in flow,
they use surfing and talk therapy,

553
00:31:08.620 --> 00:31:12.250
put over a thousand soldiers through this protocol.
And what did they discover?

554
00:31:12.670 --> 00:31:14.710
Because the neurobiology is very similar.

555
00:31:15.250 --> 00:31:19.300
Five weeks of surfing and talk therapy was enough to significantly reduce or

556
00:31:19.301 --> 00:31:24.070
completely cure PTSD in returning soldiers.
Then the Dod said,
okay,

557
00:31:24.071 --> 00:31:26.560
that's cool.
Let's try it again.
With Meditation,

558
00:31:27.160 --> 00:31:29.800
they did four weeks of mantra based meditation.

559
00:31:29.801 --> 00:31:33.610
20 minutes a day was enough to significantly reduce PTSD.

560
00:31:33.640 --> 00:31:34.870
And when I say significantly reduce,

561
00:31:34.900 --> 00:31:39.250
I mean they're off their meds or significantly off their meds or it's completely

562
00:31:39.251 --> 00:31:43.540
gone.
So three different approaches,
three different altered states,
right,

563
00:31:43.541 --> 00:31:47.560
that you would not normally associated with one another yet very similar
impacts.

564
00:31:47.740 --> 00:31:49.870
And we see this on the curing side of the equation.

565
00:31:50.020 --> 00:31:54.280
We also see it on the high performance side,
right?
We see,

566
00:31:54.281 --> 00:31:57.340
we talked earlier about flows,
impact on creativity.

567
00:31:57.490 --> 00:32:01.180
While there's some really cool research that was done in the Netherlands for

568
00:32:01.390 --> 00:32:05.680
example,
where they were looking at open senses,
Meditation,
um,

569
00:32:05.710 --> 00:32:09.490
this is where you're taking in information and you're not judging it too
harshly,

570
00:32:09.491 --> 00:32:13.630
but it's not mantra focus.
Meditation opens his,
his meditation tends to be very,

571
00:32:13.631 --> 00:32:16.820
very good for divergent thinking.
Focus Meditation is good for convergence.

572
00:32:16.970 --> 00:32:19.870
It turns out,
but they're seeing a,
in the studies,

573
00:32:19.871 --> 00:32:24.871
they were on three 45 minute open monitoring meditation sessions,

574
00:32:25.300 --> 00:32:28.900
enough to significantly increase fluency,
flexibility,

575
00:32:28.901 --> 00:32:33.900
originality and elaboration,
which are four key characteristics of uh,

576
00:32:33.940 --> 00:32:37.300
creativity and microdosing,
which your sob,

577
00:32:37.301 --> 00:32:40.670
perceptual doses of psychedelics,
right?
So you're taking small,

578
00:32:40.671 --> 00:32:43.790
small doses of psychedelics.
Microdosing James,
Matt Up.

579
00:32:43.791 --> 00:32:45.740
His research is founded on average,

580
00:32:45.741 --> 00:32:49.550
you're getting a 200% boost in creativity.

581
00:32:49.810 --> 00:32:52.550
And I'm just the list.
So this is a list.

582
00:32:52.670 --> 00:32:56.540
The regional microdosing creativity study was done here in Silicon Valley,

583
00:32:56.541 --> 00:33:01.370
was done back in the 60 was the last legal study done before they shut down LSD

584
00:33:01.371 --> 00:33:03.830
research and literally they shut it down the next day,

585
00:33:03.950 --> 00:33:06.830
but he took a bunch of people from the valley and he said,
okay,

586
00:33:07.100 --> 00:33:10.370
all you guys was people who were selected because they had spent months trying

587
00:33:10.371 --> 00:33:14.780
to solve a hard technical creative challenge and gave them my giving microdose

588
00:33:14.781 --> 00:33:18.620
sub perceptual doses of loosening and this is the list of some of the stuff that

589
00:33:18.621 --> 00:33:22.340
came out the other side that was incredibly useful improvement to a magnetic

590
00:33:22.341 --> 00:33:23.174
tape recorder,

591
00:33:23.180 --> 00:33:27.470
math theorem regarding nor gates new model will photon space probe to measure

592
00:33:27.471 --> 00:33:31.190
solar properties,
new building design on and on,
right?

593
00:33:31.280 --> 00:33:35.360
So huge practical boosts and creativity.
We're seeing the same thing.
In fact,

594
00:33:35.840 --> 00:33:39.140
you saw early on that list technologically mediated states,

595
00:33:39.680 --> 00:33:43.340
really crazy study done at the University of Australia and creativity and flow.

596
00:33:43.550 --> 00:33:48.050
They took a bunch of people and they gave them the nine dot problem to solve.

597
00:33:48.051 --> 00:33:51.590
You've seen this connect nine dots with four lines in 10 minutes without lifting

598
00:33:51.591 --> 00:33:55.820
your pencil from a paper,
right?
Under normal conditions,
less than five people,

599
00:33:55.880 --> 00:33:59.060
5% of people can solve it in their study group.
Nobody did.

600
00:33:59.270 --> 00:34:01.580
Then they use transcranial magnetic stimulation.

601
00:34:01.581 --> 00:34:06.020
They artificially knocked out the prefrontal cortex by sending a weak magnetic

602
00:34:06.021 --> 00:34:07.610
pulse.
So it's artificially induced.

603
00:34:07.611 --> 00:34:11.780
Transient hypofrontality artificially produces 20 to 40 minute flow state,

604
00:34:12.200 --> 00:34:15.080
50% of their study groups solve that problem in record time.

605
00:34:15.440 --> 00:34:19.070
So we're seeing on all all these wildly different states,

606
00:34:19.370 --> 00:34:22.130
same impact on both sides of the spectrum.

607
00:34:22.160 --> 00:34:26.180
They have potential to really treat intractable conditions and they have the

608
00:34:26.181 --> 00:34:29.540
potential to massively improve performance.
This,
by the way,

609
00:34:29.750 --> 00:34:33.350
just in case you're curious,
the one thing I haven't talked about,

610
00:34:33.351 --> 00:34:36.230
we talked about neuroanatomy,
neuro chemistry,
and our electricity,

611
00:34:36.231 --> 00:34:39.170
which are three of the things you need to talk about to talk about brain stuff.

612
00:34:39.320 --> 00:34:40.850
We did not talk about networks,

613
00:34:41.090 --> 00:34:45.290
but just so you have some idea of where that heightened creativity is.
Uh,

614
00:34:45.470 --> 00:34:49.280
when you're on psychedelics,
this is work done by Robin Carhart Harris.

615
00:34:49.490 --> 00:34:53.480
He's at imperial college doing really great imaging studies on psychedelics.

616
00:34:53.720 --> 00:34:58.280
We've teamed up with them to do the very first flow and psychedelic side by
side,

617
00:34:58.400 --> 00:35:00.890
comparative contrast,
altered states study on that.

618
00:35:00.891 --> 00:35:05.870
We're going to be launching I think first week of June.
Um,
so coming up.

619
00:35:06.080 --> 00:35:07.700
But anyways,
on the left side,

620
00:35:07.730 --> 00:35:11.750
this is your brain brain connectivity on under normal conditions on the right

621
00:35:11.751 --> 00:35:14.180
side,
that is what your brain looks like in Siliciden.

622
00:35:14.630 --> 00:35:18.860
It is the most network connectivity we see in the brain.

623
00:35:19.010 --> 00:35:22.640
That is why creativity is going through the roof.

624
00:35:23.690 --> 00:35:27.100
This is also why we're now seeing this is the cover of the economist and it's

625
00:35:27.101 --> 00:35:30.980
still makes my brain explode to look at it term tune on,

626
00:35:31.010 --> 00:35:32.630
turn on and drop by the office.

627
00:35:32.840 --> 00:35:37.380
It is about microdosing at work and it's the cover of the economist.
So yeah,

628
00:35:37.381 --> 00:35:40.050
this stuff is really going,
starting to go mainstream.

629
00:35:41.550 --> 00:35:45.540
And the best news of all is that this consciousness is incredibly,
incredibly,

630
00:35:45.541 --> 00:35:49.170
incredibly hackable and you don't actually have to take itself psychedelic

631
00:35:49.171 --> 00:35:51.690
substance.
So on the flow side.

632
00:35:52.090 --> 00:35:54.660
Talked a little bit of a second because I want to jump back to flow.

633
00:35:55.620 --> 00:35:57.480
One of the things that we've discovered very,

634
00:35:57.481 --> 00:35:59.910
very recently is that flow states have triggers.

635
00:35:59.940 --> 00:36:02.490
These are preconditions that lead to more flow.

636
00:36:02.670 --> 00:36:06.420
So if you're interested in kind of hacking your consciousness with this stuff,

637
00:36:06.630 --> 00:36:11.430
these 20 triggers are your toolkit and we have individual triggers.

638
00:36:11.450 --> 00:36:14.820
There are 10 or 11 of these that will drive an individual into flow.

639
00:36:14.970 --> 00:36:17.940
And then we have group triggers.
This is the product of key soils.

640
00:36:17.960 --> 00:36:21.810
Researchers at the University of North Carolina and there are 10 group trekkers

641
00:36:21.811 --> 00:36:26.250
and group triggers will drive a team and to flow produce a collective shared

642
00:36:26.550 --> 00:36:28.440
flow state known as group flow,
right?

643
00:36:28.500 --> 00:36:31.740
You've taken part in a great brainstorming session where the ideas are flying

644
00:36:31.741 --> 00:36:33.810
off the wall.
That's group flow and action.

645
00:36:33.811 --> 00:36:36.690
If we've seen a fourth quarter comeback and football or basketball,

646
00:36:36.870 --> 00:36:39.040
that's group flow in action.
Um,

647
00:36:39.780 --> 00:36:43.560
and you can talk a little bit more about these triggers in a second.

648
00:36:43.561 --> 00:36:45.960
But the one thing I want to tell you just so you know,

649
00:36:45.980 --> 00:36:49.890
is flow follows focus only shows up on all our attention isn't the right here

650
00:36:49.891 --> 00:36:51.900
right now.
That's what these triggers do.

651
00:36:52.110 --> 00:36:55.590
They drive our attention into the present moment.
More specifically,

652
00:36:55.591 --> 00:36:59.610
not all of them,
but most of them tend to drive norepinephrine and dopamine,

653
00:36:59.611 --> 00:37:01.260
which are our main focus and chemicals.

654
00:37:01.261 --> 00:37:06.190
That's really what's going on under the hood.
Now I want to a,

655
00:37:06.240 --> 00:37:09.300
I don't want to leave you hanging.
I want to give you some practical advice.

656
00:37:09.390 --> 00:37:13.870
So I said we just did a giant study on creativity and flow.
Um,
it was,
it was,

657
00:37:13.890 --> 00:37:16.770
it was interesting,
but 2100 people took part.

658
00:37:17.130 --> 00:37:20.190
And what we were looking at is among other things,

659
00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:24.660
what triggers are most associated with heightened creativity?
Um,

660
00:37:24.780 --> 00:37:28.140
first we wanted to look at the big numbers that create creativity with this 400

661
00:37:28.141 --> 00:37:32.340
to 700% spike.
We were like,
well,
what the hell is that?
What?
What's actually,

662
00:37:32.370 --> 00:37:35.460
what do we mean by creativity?
So we broke creativity down.

663
00:37:35.461 --> 00:37:37.770
We looked at the process portions of creativity.

664
00:37:38.010 --> 00:37:40.940
And so we found that idea generation,
for example,

665
00:37:40.960 --> 00:37:45.750
goes up 40% problem solving goes up 40% and so you start to see where those big

666
00:37:45.751 --> 00:37:48.510
numbers come from cause these things start to stack on one another.

667
00:37:48.720 --> 00:37:53.310
We also found three triggers are most associated with creativity across the

668
00:37:53.311 --> 00:37:55.830
board in knowledge workers,
right?

669
00:37:55.831 --> 00:37:57.600
So what everybody in this room does for a living.

670
00:37:57.810 --> 00:38:02.280
The first is obvious complete concentration flow follows focus only shows up

671
00:38:02.281 --> 00:38:06.000
when we're in the right here right now.
But what that means by the way,

672
00:38:06.030 --> 00:38:09.600
is the research shows us that you need 90 to 120 minutes of uninterrupted

673
00:38:09.601 --> 00:38:11.580
concentration and really maximize flow.

674
00:38:11.970 --> 00:38:15.510
So that means you need 900 120 minutes where your office door can be shut,

675
00:38:15.511 --> 00:38:18.180
where your phone is off,
where your email is off.

676
00:38:18.181 --> 00:38:20.730
We're Facebook is off where Twitter is off.

677
00:38:20.820 --> 00:38:24.450
It means if you're running a team right and you're telling your team members

678
00:38:24.451 --> 00:38:26.550
that they have to email you back in a half an hour,

679
00:38:26.760 --> 00:38:30.840
you're literally locking that team out of the very state of consciousness.

680
00:38:31.050 --> 00:38:33.660
They need to maximize performance.
For example.

681
00:38:33.661 --> 00:38:36.990
It's why when I go into organizations,
I always tend to save.

682
00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:40.690
You can't hang a door sign on your door that says,
beep off,
I'm flowing.

683
00:38:41.800 --> 00:38:42.970
You're sunk.
Right?

684
00:38:43.750 --> 00:38:47.140
Next thing we see with creativity is it requires the challenge skills balance

685
00:38:47.141 --> 00:38:48.580
often called the golden rule of flow.

686
00:38:48.610 --> 00:38:52.870
Most important flows triggers the idea is that we pay the most attention to the

687
00:38:52.871 --> 00:38:53.740
right here,
right now.

688
00:38:53.741 --> 00:38:57.520
Task at hand when the challenge of the task at hand slightly exceeds our

689
00:38:57.521 --> 00:39:01.180
skillset.
So you want to stretch but not snap emotionally.

690
00:39:01.181 --> 00:39:05.260
This means flows sits not on but near the midpoint between boredom,

691
00:39:05.560 --> 00:39:08.400
not as stimulation.
I could give a shit and anxiety.
He whoa.

692
00:39:08.410 --> 00:39:12.530
Way Too much stimulation right in between is this sweet spot.
Um,

693
00:39:13.480 --> 00:39:18.130
finally,
immediate feedback.
This should come as no surprise here at Google,

694
00:39:18.280 --> 00:39:20.440
but you know,
this is one of the reasons by the way,

695
00:39:20.441 --> 00:39:21.790
we saw so much flow and action.

696
00:39:21.791 --> 00:39:25.150
Sports mass and actions where if you have immediate feedback,
you're a skier.

697
00:39:25.330 --> 00:39:28.420
You don't set that edge at the top of the raw and you're on a face first death

698
00:39:28.421 --> 00:39:32.350
slide to the bottom.
It's really obvious.
Same thing happens in software,

699
00:39:32.351 --> 00:39:35.920
of course,
agile software,
the entire agile movement,
right,

700
00:39:35.980 --> 00:39:38.050
was about tightening up feedback loops.

701
00:39:38.051 --> 00:39:41.800
And one of the reasons is it maximizes creative flow,
right?

702
00:39:42.040 --> 00:39:45.400
And so obviously,
you know,
in business for example,

703
00:39:45.401 --> 00:39:47.740
if you've got quarterly reports or annual reports,

704
00:39:47.741 --> 00:39:52.370
and that's the only feedback you're getting,
it's a disaster for this stuff.
Um,

705
00:39:53.530 --> 00:39:56.380
the last thing I wanna tell you about the triggers is,
um,

706
00:39:57.080 --> 00:40:01.840
they're remarkably easy to train.
And if you would've come to me five years ago,

707
00:40:01.841 --> 00:40:06.790
in fact,
the last time I spoke here in two times ago
and said,

708
00:40:06.791 --> 00:40:10.150
what,
what do you believe about flow?
What would you bet your house on?

709
00:40:10.151 --> 00:40:14.020
I would've bet my house that this stuff is massively hard to train.
Absolutely.

710
00:40:14.390 --> 00:40:17.470
Turns out we were deadly wrong about that.
Um,

711
00:40:18.310 --> 00:40:23.020
the example is,
uh,
two or three years ago,
thanks to Adam Leonard,
um,

712
00:40:23.021 --> 00:40:26.440
we teamed up with you guys and ran a six week joint learning exercise,
right?

713
00:40:26.680 --> 00:40:28.300
And over a course of six weeks,

714
00:40:28.301 --> 00:40:30.880
we took about 70 Googlers from all over the company.

715
00:40:30.881 --> 00:40:34.720
So facilities and sales and marketing and coding and engineering.

716
00:40:34.721 --> 00:40:37.810
And take your pick and we train people up.
Um,

717
00:40:37.900 --> 00:40:41.110
but an hour's worth of homework a day in four high performance basics,

718
00:40:41.111 --> 00:40:43.330
I mean basics like sleep hygiene,
right?

719
00:40:43.331 --> 00:40:46.000
Get enough sleep at night and then put yourself on a sleep monitor to take care

720
00:40:46.001 --> 00:40:50.770
of it.
Um,
and uh,
the use of really what amount to do for flow triggers.

721
00:40:50.800 --> 00:40:53.410
And on the back end of that we tested flow pre and post.

722
00:40:53.620 --> 00:40:57.640
We found a 35 to 80% increase and flow,

723
00:40:58.160 --> 00:41:01.000
I'm here now it's a little high,

724
00:41:01.001 --> 00:41:03.880
but because people self selected to be in that class,
right?

725
00:41:03.880 --> 00:41:05.300
They were already interested in the topic.

726
00:41:05.301 --> 00:41:08.020
So those numbers are probably a little skewed.
But I will tell you,

727
00:41:08.021 --> 00:41:10.780
we have a digitally delivered course called flow fundamentals.

728
00:41:11.290 --> 00:41:13.870
And it's the same thing,
same similar structure.

729
00:41:13.871 --> 00:41:16.450
We were a little more intensive than what we did here.
But again,

730
00:41:16.451 --> 00:41:20.200
we measure pre and post and on average and thousands of people who have taken

731
00:41:20.201 --> 00:41:24.130
this course.
By now we're seeing a 70% increase in each of flows metrics.

732
00:41:24.131 --> 00:41:28.360
And this doesn't mean our Kung Fu is exceptionally bad ass,
which it is.

733
00:41:28.720 --> 00:41:31.480
What it really means is that this stuff is really easy.

734
00:41:31.481 --> 00:41:35.420
We're all biologically hardwired for it.
Um,
which is really,

735
00:41:35.421 --> 00:41:37.280
really cool and we're getting options,
right?

736
00:41:37.281 --> 00:41:40.350
This is the transcranial magnetic stimulation I talked about.
Um,

737
00:41:40.520 --> 00:41:44.900
because pattern recognition is so heightened and flow radar operators is a radar

738
00:41:44.901 --> 00:41:49.160
operator in the u s military are using it before they go on shipped stockbrokers

739
00:41:49.161 --> 00:41:52.910
because you can see so much more patterns in Wall Street are doing this before

740
00:41:52.911 --> 00:41:54.530
they're going onto the trading floor.

741
00:41:54.830 --> 00:41:57.680
We're seeing similar things in Hegi Development,
right?

742
00:41:57.890 --> 00:42:02.090
Back in the 1990s at the same time,
Andy Newberg was doing his really brave work.

743
00:42:02.300 --> 00:42:05.810
Another guy named Richard Davidson started recording the brainwaves of monks,

744
00:42:06.020 --> 00:42:06.950
Tibetan Buddhists,

745
00:42:07.130 --> 00:42:12.130
who had 30 years of meditation time and he discovered some really cool things

746
00:42:12.861 --> 00:42:16.400
that their brain waves essentially sit on the edge of flow at all times and that

747
00:42:16.401 --> 00:42:18.020
there's yelled huge amount of gamma,

748
00:42:18.021 --> 00:42:20.510
which you want for extra creativity in their brainwaves.

749
00:42:20.780 --> 00:42:25.780
But who the hell has 30 years,
let alone 30 hours,
right?
So what did we do?
Well,

750
00:42:25.781 --> 00:42:29.480
we recorded those brainwaves and now using neurofeedback and Eg,

751
00:42:29.600 --> 00:42:34.280
we are training to people to move in the same direction in three weeks,

752
00:42:34.281 --> 00:42:37.940
three months,
very compressed timeframes.
Um,

753
00:42:38.780 --> 00:42:40.760
in fact,
if you want more flow in your life,

754
00:42:40.790 --> 00:42:44.840
the same technology is available to you.
Go to the flow genome project.com.

755
00:42:45.020 --> 00:42:49.880
There's a free flow profile there.
Um,
under the learn tab,

756
00:42:49.881 --> 00:42:52.580
it's a diagnostic radiologist says if you're this kind of person,

757
00:42:52.581 --> 00:42:54.650
you're likely to find flow in these directions.

758
00:42:54.920 --> 00:42:57.650
It's become one of the largest studies on an optimal performance.

759
00:42:57.870 --> 00:43:01.190
Verano another killed another longstanding darling.

760
00:43:01.191 --> 00:43:04.580
We thought when we started this work flow absolutely must show up the most

761
00:43:04.770 --> 00:43:06.860
action adventure,
sport athletes.
Um,

762
00:43:06.920 --> 00:43:11.000
and in sort of performing arts people in bands,
people on stage.

763
00:43:11.001 --> 00:43:14.650
That question turns out now the vast majority of our studies that we just have

764
00:43:14.651 --> 00:43:17.540
to be like 80,000 people have taken the study at this point are knowledge

765
00:43:17.541 --> 00:43:20.750
workers.
They do what everybody in this room does for a living.

766
00:43:20.870 --> 00:43:24.050
The most flow tends to show up in knowledge work.
Alright,

767
00:43:24.920 --> 00:43:28.490
wrap this all up.
I want to give you one sort of big picture.

768
00:43:28.491 --> 00:43:32.990
Look at all this stuff,
so stealing fire,
origin story.

769
00:43:33.200 --> 00:43:35.740
I was writing a book called rise of Superman,

770
00:43:35.780 --> 00:43:38.840
about flow and I was talking to Salim Ismail who was at that point,

771
00:43:38.841 --> 00:43:43.010
the executive director of singularity university and Seleme,

772
00:43:43.100 --> 00:43:45.620
a former director of innovation at Yahoo,

773
00:43:46.010 --> 00:43:48.990
really interested in flow and innovation and we were talking any,

774
00:43:49.040 --> 00:43:52.280
he's pointed out,
he's like,
you know Steven,
if you think about it,

775
00:43:52.281 --> 00:43:55.520
every time you go to a sporting event,
all right,
if you go to a basketball game,

776
00:43:55.521 --> 00:43:59.420
you're playing to see players and flow,
and he said,

777
00:43:59.421 --> 00:44:00.560
if you go to see a movie,

778
00:44:00.590 --> 00:44:03.380
you're going to see actors and flow and you're hoping to get a director was in

779
00:44:03.381 --> 00:44:05.750
flow.
When they shut the movie,
you're a poetry reading on.
He said,

780
00:44:05.751 --> 00:44:10.010
I bet it's a large portion of the GDP,
and that caught our attention.

781
00:44:10.050 --> 00:44:13.730
They caught my attention and I started thinking about it and when we started

782
00:44:13.731 --> 00:44:18.140
doing the research for stealing fire and figuring out that,
hey,
wait a minute,

783
00:44:18.141 --> 00:44:22.030
flow,
meditative states caught ablative states,

784
00:44:22.040 --> 00:44:25.670
psychedelic states,
et Cetera,
et cetera.
All these things are very,
very similar.

785
00:44:25.910 --> 00:44:29.840
We said,
well let's try to measure that.
Let's measure the altered state economy.

786
00:44:29.841 --> 00:44:34.841
How much money do people spend chasing this experience of selflessness,

787
00:44:34.861 --> 00:44:37.590
timelessness,
effortlessness and richness.
Right?

788
00:44:37.950 --> 00:44:40.500
And I'm not going to walk you through the calculation.

789
00:44:40.590 --> 00:44:45.330
It is in the footnotes to stealing fire,
police hammer on it,

790
00:44:45.360 --> 00:44:48.360
run your own calculations and I spent a year working on it.

791
00:44:48.480 --> 00:44:53.070
I want it to get as rigorous as possible cause it's mindblowing in what it tells

792
00:44:53.071 --> 00:44:55.950
us.
And the first thing I also want to point out is not all of this stuff is

793
00:44:55.951 --> 00:44:56.671
positive,
right?

794
00:44:56.671 --> 00:44:59.420
What I'm telling you about selflessness and effortlessness and information rich

795
00:44:59.421 --> 00:45:01.590
and all this stuff.
Some people seeking it out,

796
00:45:01.591 --> 00:45:03.660
they're going and doing meditation retreats,

797
00:45:03.750 --> 00:45:08.280
retreats or developing a yoga practice or they're pursuing flow and a lot of

798
00:45:08.281 --> 00:45:11.610
people are just taking a lot of drugs,
right?
There's a negative downside,

799
00:45:11.611 --> 00:45:14.400
dark side to all of this as well.
And we measured that as well.

800
00:45:14.520 --> 00:45:15.820
But when we were done,
you know,

801
00:45:15.840 --> 00:45:20.400
are very conservative calculation came up with a figure that is $4 trillion a

802
00:45:20.401 --> 00:45:20.820
year.

803
00:45:20.820 --> 00:45:25.820
It is one 16th of the global economy that we spend trying to get out of our

804
00:45:26.191 --> 00:45:28.440
head,
trying to shift our consciousness in this way.

805
00:45:28.680 --> 00:45:31.920
And as you can see from the stuff I'm talking about,
those numbers,

806
00:45:31.921 --> 00:45:35.280
because we're getting very precise,
we're getting better at this,
right?

807
00:45:35.281 --> 00:45:38.040
We're being able to tune this in ways like we never could before and being able

808
00:45:38.041 --> 00:45:41.580
to get some more of the positive benefits in less than the negative benefits.

809
00:45:41.730 --> 00:45:45.290
This is only going to grow over time.
Um,

810
00:45:45.390 --> 00:45:48.990
and I think the last thing I want to tell you today is that I think all of this

811
00:45:48.991 --> 00:45:53.991
information puts kind of a wonderful and yet really terrible burden on each and

812
00:45:54.091 --> 00:45:56.880
every one of us.
Cause you got to ask yourself,
right,

813
00:45:57.810 --> 00:46:00.510
what kind of impossible challenges are you going to go after?

814
00:46:00.720 --> 00:46:05.550
If you could be 500% more productive,
if you could be 600% more creative,

815
00:46:05.880 --> 00:46:08.580
if you could cut your learning times in half.
All right.

816
00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:14.000
The science is pretty overwhelming that that's exactly what is available to each

817
00:46:15.841 --> 00:46:20.490
and every one of you today,
right?
As Alice Walker pointed out so many years ago,

818
00:46:20.491 --> 00:46:22.350
we are the ones we've been waiting for.

819
00:46:22.890 --> 00:46:27.090
But what we choose to do with that information remains entirely up to us.

820
00:46:27.750 --> 00:46:29.970
But thanks for listening and I'm happy to take some questions.

821
00:46:30.990 --> 00:46:35.350
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

822
00:46:36.060 --> 00:46:40.350
<v 0>so I'm wondering if there's any limits in age for flow.
So,
and I'm asking,</v>

823
00:46:40.351 --> 00:46:44.380
I'm coaching my 10 year olds baseball team and uh,

824
00:46:44.910 --> 00:46:47.660
like to hear your thoughts on it.
It's a great question.
Um,

825
00:46:48.360 --> 00:46:53.070
so as you were talking,
um,
I,
I don't know if there were upper limits.
Um,

826
00:46:53.071 --> 00:46:56.070
I really don't,
uh,
age-related limits.
I realized as you were talking,
I was like,

827
00:46:56.071 --> 00:46:58.530
God,
I've never even asked that question or even thought about that.

828
00:46:58.590 --> 00:47:01.290
So there may be upper limit stuff that I don't know about.

829
00:47:01.740 --> 00:47:05.610
Kids are actually very flow prone because developmentally their prefrontal

830
00:47:05.611 --> 00:47:09.210
cortex doesn't finish developing until you're 25.
Right?
So,
um,

831
00:47:09.300 --> 00:47:12.110
that's why your nose is the last thing to grow a space for your prefrontal

832
00:47:12.120 --> 00:47:13.590
cortex.
Right.
Um,

833
00:47:14.010 --> 00:47:18.090
and so they're developmentally geared towards transient hypofrontality and their

834
00:47:18.091 --> 00:47:22.950
brainwaves are actually naturally close to Alpha than we adults are in Beta.

835
00:47:23.100 --> 00:47:27.590
Kids tend to be closer to Alpha.
Um,
so kids are flood prone.
In,

836
00:47:27.640 --> 00:47:31.840
in my book,
rise of Superman,
we talked about like the crazy places is showing up.

837
00:47:32.290 --> 00:47:35.050
Flow coaching is she's gotten into action sports early.
Right.

838
00:47:35.051 --> 00:47:37.300
And we saw it and skating for example,

839
00:47:37.510 --> 00:47:42.510
you routinely see 12 to 14 year old kids when the x Games beating 25 to 35 like

840
00:47:43.211 --> 00:47:44.200
professional athletes.

841
00:47:44.440 --> 00:47:49.440
And one of the reasons is because flow coaching has been in action sports for

842
00:47:50.771 --> 00:47:53.850
longer,
right in mainstream sports at popped in,
uh,

843
00:47:53.890 --> 00:47:58.300
Jimmy Johnson said the Dallas cowboys won the Superbowl back in the 90s and he

844
00:47:58.301 --> 00:48:02.020
credited chicks at me.
Hi.
So it flows been in sports for a while,

845
00:48:02.170 --> 00:48:04.070
but not at the level it,

846
00:48:04.180 --> 00:48:08.070
those traditional batted ball sports are a little more conservative.
Right.
Um,

847
00:48:08.440 --> 00:48:13.060
and action sports,
you know,
they weren't even sports back in the 90s.
Right?
Um,

848
00:48:13.390 --> 00:48:17.300
so there's been a lot more flow coaching.
We're seeing interesting results.
Uh,

849
00:48:17.310 --> 00:48:19.360
a friend of ours,
we are working with,
um,

850
00:48:19.550 --> 00:48:24.550
a guy in Minnesota who is doing a bunch of flow work in grade school and they're

851
00:48:25.060 --> 00:48:27.880
using the flow profile with kids.
Uh,

852
00:48:28.210 --> 00:48:31.330
I'm trying to figure out what's their dominant flow area and then having them do

853
00:48:31.331 --> 00:48:34.810
a lot of independent studies over the years and there the ideas that they can

854
00:48:34.811 --> 00:48:38.320
get them into high school already knowing what produces the most flow in their

855
00:48:38.321 --> 00:48:42.430
life and what they're most passionate about,
they'll have a leg up.
Um,
so we're,

856
00:48:42.431 --> 00:48:44.980
we're doing some of that work.
We're looking at it,
but there's a ways to go.

857
00:48:45.310 --> 00:48:48.550
Thank you.
Sure.
Hi.

858
00:48:49.320 --> 00:48:52.060
They talk once they thinking about this,
I'm sold.

859
00:48:52.061 --> 00:48:55.240
I want to be in flow all the time.
Very productive.
Very great.
Awesome.

860
00:48:55.270 --> 00:49:00.160
But thinking about,
uh,
the chemicals that have heightened levels,

861
00:49:00.310 --> 00:49:03.430
isn't there supposed to be a crash?
Like what?
I know is it,
okay.

862
00:49:03.431 --> 00:49:05.650
So let me stop there.

863
00:49:06.080 --> 00:49:09.010
That's if you were going to say that nobody gets to be in flow all the time are

864
00:49:09.040 --> 00:49:12.970
like,
people come up to me about once a month at night.
Dude,
Steven steeps,

865
00:49:13.270 --> 00:49:15.430
I'm at flow all the time.
You should study me.

866
00:49:15.760 --> 00:49:17.170
And this has been happening for years.

867
00:49:17.470 --> 00:49:22.030
And in the beginning I didn't know what to say.
And now I'm just honest.
I'm like,

868
00:49:22.360 --> 00:49:26.050
absolutely.
We know we have a term for that.
We call that schizophrenia.

869
00:49:26.500 --> 00:49:29.620
Sometimes we call that mania depending,
but it's an either or.
Right?

870
00:49:29.710 --> 00:49:30.550
Flows a cycle.

871
00:49:30.640 --> 00:49:34.220
This is her Benson did a lot of the foundational neuroscience on this.
Um,

872
00:49:34.270 --> 00:49:36.310
and it's a Ford Park Cycle.
And as you pointed out,

873
00:49:36.311 --> 00:49:38.580
those neurochemicals that show up in the flow,
oh,

874
00:49:38.590 --> 00:49:40.480
are expensive for the brain to produce,
right?

875
00:49:40.481 --> 00:49:45.010
They require minerals and some of them require sunlight and some of them require

876
00:49:45.011 --> 00:49:48.100
vitamins and foods and blah,
blah,
blah.
And um,

877
00:49:48.940 --> 00:49:52.810
so there's a recovery time,
right?
Norepinephrine and dopamine for example,

878
00:49:52.811 --> 00:49:54.700
why are Ted talks 20 minutes long?

879
00:49:54.820 --> 00:49:57.940
Because these are your two principal focusing chemicals and they are most of the

880
00:49:57.941 --> 00:50:00.790
exhausted after 20 minutes at peak concentration.

881
00:50:00.791 --> 00:50:02.890
So you've ever seen a James Bond movie,
right?

882
00:50:02.891 --> 00:50:06.010
Everything blows up for the first half an hour and then you're bored to death

883
00:50:06.011 --> 00:50:07.450
for the rest of the time.
Right.

884
00:50:07.540 --> 00:50:11.230
It's cause you've exhausted all your focusing fueled good drugs and now you've

885
00:50:11.231 --> 00:50:13.630
just got bad popcorn on your stomach.
Right?

886
00:50:13.690 --> 00:50:16.600
I mean literally like that's that feeling.
So yes,

887
00:50:16.601 --> 00:50:20.470
on the backside of flow there is a recovery period for sure.

888
00:50:20.471 --> 00:50:25.471
It's built in so nobody gets to live in flow as far as we can tell even.

889
00:50:26.280 --> 00:50:28.400
Uh,
there's some really interesting work.

890
00:50:28.460 --> 00:50:33.460
Some people often miss conflated enlightenment with permanent flow.

891
00:50:34.040 --> 00:50:37.370
Like there's an idea out there that enlightenment might be permanent flow.

892
00:50:37.670 --> 00:50:42.140
We've actually made some really interesting progress on studying so called

893
00:50:42.141 --> 00:50:44.760
enlightenment.
Um,
and the one thing that we're pretty sure it is,

894
00:50:44.761 --> 00:50:46.160
it doesn't appear to be permanent flow.

895
00:50:46.161 --> 00:50:49.820
It seems that it takes the shift in perspective that you get from flow,

896
00:50:49.821 --> 00:50:52.100
that kind of expansive oneness with everything.

897
00:50:52.101 --> 00:50:55.150
It allows you to access it under normal conditions.
Um,

898
00:50:55.220 --> 00:50:57.410
but it doesn't seem to be a permanent flow state.
I don't,

899
00:50:57.470 --> 00:50:59.930
I don't think that's possible outside of a manic episode.

900
00:51:00.130 --> 00:51:03.620
I don't think that's possible.
Thanks.
Sure.
Thanks for asking.

901
00:51:05.190 --> 00:51:06.870
<v 2>Thank you for this fantastic talk.</v>

902
00:51:06.900 --> 00:51:10.870
So what you essentially a doctor about his meditation one on one,

903
00:51:11.060 --> 00:51:13.830
a lot of the concepts are very similar.
Um,

904
00:51:14.580 --> 00:51:19.030
there are these um,
um,
gadgets,
these tastes,
um,

905
00:51:19.250 --> 00:51:22.240
they call it the brain balancing.
Apparently there are,

906
00:51:22.440 --> 00:51:25.540
they can induce you into your flow state.
Um,

907
00:51:25.770 --> 00:51:28.750
there are certain devices the EEG based which uh,

908
00:51:28.770 --> 00:51:33.090
people with Adhd used to train and that is nothing but attention training.

909
00:51:33.091 --> 00:51:36.780
So you look at a certain pattern on the screen and you focus your attention

910
00:51:36.800 --> 00:51:37.730
thereby,
uh,

911
00:51:37.920 --> 00:51:42.210
tried to do something repeat repeatedly and you slowly get into your flow state

912
00:51:42.240 --> 00:51:44.070
by doing this.
So this is well known,

913
00:51:44.310 --> 00:51:49.050
but the other kind of devices is the claim is that you don't need to do

914
00:51:49.051 --> 00:51:52.170
anything.
You don't need to focus your attention,

915
00:51:52.380 --> 00:51:54.360
but it plays some signals,

916
00:51:54.420 --> 00:51:59.100
some sounds in your ears and apparently it's supposed to divert your state

917
00:51:59.400 --> 00:52:02.340
towards these flow states.
I don't know how much it is.

918
00:52:02.810 --> 00:52:04.910
<v 0>I call bullshit.
It's VSA.
Okay.</v>

919
00:52:08.510 --> 00:52:10.100
What I found consistently,

920
00:52:11.060 --> 00:52:16.060
is there a lot of people out there who have a device that measures one thing or

921
00:52:16.311 --> 00:52:18.200
does one thing and they want to call it flow.

922
00:52:19.070 --> 00:52:22.370
So we've got this EEG device that drives your brainwaves to the Alpha Theta

923
00:52:22.371 --> 00:52:24.410
border line and it's got to put you into flow.
Well No,

924
00:52:24.411 --> 00:52:27.230
it's going to drive your brainwaves to the Alpha Theta borderline.
Okay.

925
00:52:27.470 --> 00:52:31.510
But flow is changes in network structure is trained in anatomy.

926
00:52:31.660 --> 00:52:33.640
Helical function has changes in neurochemistry.

927
00:52:33.860 --> 00:52:37.580
It's a bunch of physiological reactions that we're just now starting to maybe

928
00:52:37.581 --> 00:52:41.120
measure and nobody's put it all together in one physiological flow detector.

929
00:52:41.150 --> 00:52:43.100
At this point though,
we are working on one,

930
00:52:43.430 --> 00:52:47.120
but anytime I hear a single correlate hypothesis,
it takes your brain waves.

931
00:52:47.121 --> 00:52:51.200
It does this and put it calling it flow to me.
I don't understand that.

932
00:52:51.230 --> 00:52:52.063
Like I don't,

933
00:52:52.070 --> 00:52:56.360
I don't understand why people are doing that when we know flow has total shift

934
00:52:56.361 --> 00:53:01.070
in brand function.
So that's first of all,
when it comes to sound though,

935
00:53:01.071 --> 00:53:04.850
I have friends,
we'll Henshall it.
Focus will um,
brain FM.

936
00:53:04.910 --> 00:53:09.560
There's some really interesting groups doing really good work on sound and flow.

937
00:53:10.010 --> 00:53:13.940
My friend Chris Barker who runs advanced brain monitoring and in Carlsbad,

938
00:53:13.941 --> 00:53:14.990
California,
there,

939
00:53:15.020 --> 00:53:19.610
she's the person who teamed up a with the dod to do the flow in the accelerated

940
00:53:19.611 --> 00:53:22.550
learning stuff.
Um,
it's give a Ted talk.
You can find that online.

941
00:53:22.940 --> 00:53:25.980
One of the things they did is they look at by will beats,
right?

942
00:53:25.981 --> 00:53:29.370
There were 400 companies doing sound would buy on our beats and it's supposed to

943
00:53:29.371 --> 00:53:30.900
put you in flow and whatever.
And they,

944
00:53:30.990 --> 00:53:35.250
she literally like put the most shit they make just about the best EEG

945
00:53:35.430 --> 00:53:39.300
measurement device in the world,
I think.
And uh,

946
00:53:39.330 --> 00:53:40.820
they took every buyer,

947
00:53:40.821 --> 00:53:44.640
no beads program they could find and look for any consistent neurological shift

948
00:53:44.850 --> 00:53:46.230
found nothing that was consistent.

949
00:53:46.440 --> 00:53:49.800
So I'm not saying that there is this technology out there that I'm,

950
00:53:50.010 --> 00:53:52.640
sooner or later somebody is going to crack that.
Right?
There's,

951
00:53:52.860 --> 00:53:55.950
we know from Apple's work with Sovos that,
you know,

952
00:53:56.070 --> 00:54:00.510
the power of music is really amazing in terms of its ability to shift

953
00:54:00.511 --> 00:54:05.160
consciousness.
So there's definitely something there,
right?
But I,
we can't,

954
00:54:05.161 --> 00:54:09.480
we're not,
we're not there yet.
I don't think.
Nothing I've,
and I've seen,
um,

955
00:54:09.690 --> 00:54:10.351
they're probably,

956
00:54:10.351 --> 00:54:13.290
there are probably people out there with like breakthrough technology that could

957
00:54:13.291 --> 00:54:14.700
tell me I'm lying and don't know,

958
00:54:14.701 --> 00:54:18.660
but I haven't seen anything that I comfortable with that I think does that yet.

959
00:54:19.260 --> 00:54:20.550
I think we're getting close to though,
and I,

960
00:54:20.551 --> 00:54:24.300
and I think all this stuff is an exponential growth curves.
So,

961
00:54:24.420 --> 00:54:28.500
you know what seemed absolutely ridiculous three years ago.

962
00:54:28.530 --> 00:54:32.610
You were going to get into two years,
three years.
Thank you.
Sure.

963
00:54:35.140 --> 00:54:37.090
<v 3>Thanks for coming.
Um,
it's from your comments.</v>

964
00:54:37.091 --> 00:54:40.150
It sounds like you're not a big fan of open office plans,

965
00:54:40.930 --> 00:54:44.110
but a open office plans are super big fat around here.

966
00:54:44.470 --> 00:54:49.420
So my request to you is a,
please rescue us.
What can you do for us?

967
00:54:49.520 --> 00:54:54.020
<v 0>Yeah,
that's it.
It's a fair point.
Right?
Um,
uh,
and you're not the only one.</v>

968
00:54:54.021 --> 00:54:55.130
There was a couple of years ago,

969
00:54:55.131 --> 00:54:58.100
right when Facebook decided they were going to do away with desks entirely and

970
00:54:58.101 --> 00:55:01.700
put everybody on walking desks facing each other in a circle.
So,

971
00:55:04.940 --> 00:55:06.620
I don't know if that's true or not by the way,

972
00:55:06.650 --> 00:55:11.560
but I just heard it and I was like,
what a disaster for flow.
Um,
that said,
um,

973
00:55:11.750 --> 00:55:15.800
open office plans can be really good for group flow,
right?
Dependent right there.

974
00:55:15.801 --> 00:55:19.670
They have their purpose.
But what I,
you know,
the companies that I,

975
00:55:19.700 --> 00:55:24.100
that I'm seeing that are doing this are building like any of the,
uh,
the,

976
00:55:24.101 --> 00:55:26.420
the Co workspaces that you're seeing pop up.

977
00:55:26.421 --> 00:55:29.930
They have little phone booth rooms that anybody can go into and shut the door

978
00:55:29.931 --> 00:55:31.280
and it's a private little office.

979
00:55:31.430 --> 00:55:35.780
So I'm seeing a lot of companies that like open office plans started to build in

980
00:55:35.900 --> 00:55:40.770
silence pods where you can just close yourself in and lock yourself off.
Um,

981
00:55:41.060 --> 00:55:45.950
and equally important is you've got to have your conversations about this,

982
00:55:46.070 --> 00:55:49.190
right?
If you're not going to,
if you're,
if you've got a manager and you don't,

983
00:55:49.610 --> 00:55:52.430
they're not into this whole idea of what you're doing and something that you're

984
00:55:52.431 --> 00:55:56.270
going off for $90 and 20 minutes and you're coming back and like,
I was in flow,

985
00:55:56.480 --> 00:55:58.760
it's,
you're going to be fired,
right?
Like you've got to,

986
00:55:58.770 --> 00:56:00.500
so it's gotta be done out loud.

987
00:56:00.501 --> 00:56:03.500
I think people have to understand why this is mandatory,

988
00:56:03.680 --> 00:56:06.560
but I think open office plans ultimately,
um,

989
00:56:07.010 --> 00:56:10.610
I think we're going to start to see them go away.
Um,
and I,
you know,

990
00:56:10.611 --> 00:56:13.760
I think some of this is just that we're going to be three d printing office

991
00:56:13.761 --> 00:56:16.370
buildings and we get complexity for free.

992
00:56:16.371 --> 00:56:20.330
So suddenly it's not going to be cost efficient to put everybody in cubicles.

993
00:56:20.331 --> 00:56:22.580
We're going to be at to build whole offices and I think the problem is going to

994
00:56:22.581 --> 00:56:25.930
get solved.
I think it's a money issue less than an open office plan,

995
00:56:25.931 --> 00:56:30.310
a shoe at this point.
But yeah,
they're disasters for flow.

996
00:56:33.010 --> 00:56:33.843
<v 1>Okay.</v>

997
00:56:33.920 --> 00:56:34.753
<v 4>Um,</v>

998
00:56:34.940 --> 00:56:38.930
so you talked about the psychedelic drugs,

999
00:56:38.960 --> 00:56:40.040
but I'm curious,

1000
00:56:40.070 --> 00:56:45.070
are there studies like seeing how different drugs simulate the flow state,

1001
00:56:45.261 --> 00:56:47.060
like cocaine or marijuana?

1002
00:56:47.350 --> 00:56:51.820
<v 0>So,
um,
the neurochemicals,</v>

1003
00:56:51.880 --> 00:56:55.940
the big five neuro chemicals,
every time you have,
uh,

1004
00:56:56.650 --> 00:57:01.480
a neurochemical,
right,
you have an egg dodginess negative,
exogenous chemical,

1005
00:57:01.481 --> 00:57:05.200
right?
So the body produces endorphins.

1006
00:57:05.740 --> 00:57:09.430
These are our natural opiates,
right?
So

1007
00:57:11.020 --> 00:57:14.680
flow is essentially delve man,
which is cocaine,
right?

1008
00:57:14.681 --> 00:57:16.030
Whenever you use cocaine,

1009
00:57:16.060 --> 00:57:20.380
all that happens is the brain releases a bunch of delp mean and blocks.

1010
00:57:20.381 --> 00:57:25.000
It's re uptake.
Um,
you get a little serotonin that's ecstasy,

1011
00:57:25.240 --> 00:57:29.260
you know,
at one pathway or,
or Lsd at another,
an add to mine,

1012
00:57:29.261 --> 00:57:31.580
which is you said is t h say,
um,

1013
00:57:31.680 --> 00:57:34.730
norepinephrine is essentially speed and uh,

1014
00:57:35.260 --> 00:57:37.040
I don't know what I'm forgetting hair.
Um,

1015
00:57:37.300 --> 00:57:40.330
but the point is you actually couldn't cocktail those drugs on the street,

1016
00:57:40.360 --> 00:57:42.240
which is where the interesting some of them counteract.

1017
00:57:42.380 --> 00:57:45.760
You're going to end up dead or in a coma if you try,
right?

1018
00:57:45.940 --> 00:57:50.940
What's cool is the brain can cocktail them all naturally and you don't Tan.

1019
00:57:51.220 --> 00:57:54.400
I mean,
now this does mean,
you know,
flow has a dark side,
right?

1020
00:57:54.401 --> 00:57:58.910
It's a very sticky state.
It's very addictive,
right?
And it's just a,
you know,

1021
00:57:59.050 --> 00:58:02.680
chicks at me,
I said flow is different than most other addictions.

1022
00:58:02.681 --> 00:58:05.950
Most of their addictions lead backwards flow because it always,

1023
00:58:05.951 --> 00:58:09.070
you're always extending your skills because you're walking up that challenge.

1024
00:58:09.071 --> 00:58:11.740
Skills balance isn't an addiction that leads forward.

1025
00:58:11.890 --> 00:58:16.720
But if you have a high flow lifestyle on the navy seals who we do some work

1026
00:58:16.721 --> 00:58:17.160
with,

1027
00:58:17.160 --> 00:58:21.040
when the navy seals stop being maybe seals when an action sport athletes stops

1028
00:58:21.041 --> 00:58:25.870
being an action sport athlete,
right?
When a rock star stopped being rockstar,

1029
00:58:26.080 --> 00:58:30.340
these are massively difficult transitions to handle.
Um,

1030
00:58:30.790 --> 00:58:33.160
and a lot of what we're seeing off,
for example,

1031
00:58:33.161 --> 00:58:36.700
in soldiers returning from combat and things like that is these are high flow

1032
00:58:36.701 --> 00:58:39.490
environments that compared to regular life,

1033
00:58:39.520 --> 00:58:43.210
it's really difficult and that's a big portion of the difficulty.

1034
00:58:43.211 --> 00:58:46.480
And we're doing some work around that to try to see what we can learn there.

1035
00:58:46.550 --> 00:58:48.800
There's a long way to go,
but we're poking at it.
Yeah.

1036
00:58:50.760 --> 00:58:54.380
<v 5>Anybody else?
Yeah,
I'm Doreen.</v>

1037
00:58:54.870 --> 00:58:58.590
I'm the first one is,
um,
a bone,

1038
00:58:58.650 --> 00:59:03.070
the concept of flow hike,
fast enough podcast.
Uh,

1039
00:59:03.240 --> 00:59:05.790
how can we translate flow states,
uh,

1040
00:59:05.800 --> 00:59:10.200
the to be achieved through athletic pursuits to everyday life.

1041
00:59:11.170 --> 00:59:14.910
<v 0>Um,
so part of that answer,
um,</v>

1042
00:59:15.380 --> 00:59:18.340
did they want me to break down the flow hike or was that

1043
00:59:19.160 --> 00:59:22.430
<v 5>basically,
if I understand the question,
how</v>

1044
00:59:22.760 --> 00:59:26.000
<v 0>we can sort of,
um,
uh,</v>

1045
00:59:26.240 --> 00:59:30.900
use the low hike.
Okay.
Um,

1046
00:59:31.430 --> 00:59:34.310
okay,
so there's couple of different answers.

1047
00:59:34.880 --> 00:59:38.950
The first answer is flows a focusing scale essentially,
right?

1048
00:59:38.960 --> 00:59:42.410
Like whoever said it was like meditation one-on-one a lot.

1049
00:59:42.411 --> 00:59:44.450
There's a lot of fundamentals there,
right?
We,

1050
00:59:44.600 --> 00:59:48.260
we train people in mindfulness is flow follows focus,
right?

1051
00:59:48.261 --> 00:59:52.910
So you want to drive that focus into the present tense.
How did I get here?

1052
00:59:53.090 --> 00:59:55.880
What did you ask me?
I totally lost my place.
I looked at you,

1053
00:59:55.881 --> 00:59:59.420
I did the meditation thing.
What was the question?
Flow.

1054
00:59:59.421 --> 01:00:03.040
Hike or flow through athletic pursuits in low flow through the LATIC pursuits,

1055
01:00:03.260 --> 01:00:07.070
um,
it tends to translate,
right?

1056
01:00:07.071 --> 01:00:12.071
So the flow training that I get while skiing helped me as a writer,

1057
01:00:12.170 --> 01:00:14.330
right?
It's the same kind of focus,
right?

1058
01:00:14.331 --> 01:00:17.510
So whenever you're training that you're training that.
So they're one,

1059
01:00:17.570 --> 01:00:22.160
one is the athletic pursuits will just naturally bleed over into,

1060
01:00:22.190 --> 01:00:24.950
into your everyday life.
So in other words,
the more flow you get,

1061
01:00:24.951 --> 01:00:29.660
the more flow you get,
right?
That's across the boards.
The flow hike is,
uh,

1062
01:00:29.690 --> 01:00:32.660
is not an athletic pursuit hike.
It's actually a daily flow.

1063
01:00:32.661 --> 01:00:34.730
Like you asked about the neurobiology,
right?

1064
01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:38.600
So this is a hike I use every day I wake up,

1065
01:00:38.601 --> 01:00:40.220
I start writing at four o'clock in the morning.

1066
01:00:40.221 --> 01:00:44.930
I right from forward to late am and at 8:00 AM I take my dogs for a hike and

1067
01:00:44.990 --> 01:00:47.860
it's a hike specifically designed to put me into flow.
Um,

1068
01:00:48.200 --> 01:00:51.370
meaning of my writing session was really unpleasant.
If I was struggling a bunch,

1069
01:00:51.620 --> 01:00:53.720
this is going to put me into flow on the back end.

1070
01:00:53.721 --> 01:00:58.220
And so when I come back to our co,
I'll be refresh and if it was a flow state,

1071
01:00:58.221 --> 01:00:59.360
it's a good way to reset my system.

1072
01:00:59.361 --> 01:01:04.220
But what I do is I start off and I walk uphill very slowly for 20 to 25 minutes,

1073
01:01:04.610 --> 01:01:08.360
low grade physical activity for about 20 to 25 minutes,
we'll produce,

1074
01:01:08.361 --> 01:01:10.490
exercised induced transient hypofrontality.

1075
01:01:10.610 --> 01:01:13.100
It's going to deactivate the prefrontal cortex.
We all know this,
right?

1076
01:01:13.101 --> 01:01:16.940
You go to the gym,
you work out for about 2025 minutes.
It gets quiet upstairs,

1077
01:01:16.941 --> 01:01:19.750
right?
I then run uphill.

1078
01:01:19.760 --> 01:01:22.700
I run up cliff faces or you could just sprint if you want.

1079
01:01:22.910 --> 01:01:27.260
And I do it for about five minutes or until I'm in pain basically.

1080
01:01:27.470 --> 01:01:32.120
And then I sort of slow it down and you will get endorphins and Amanda Mine,

1081
01:01:32.150 --> 01:01:35.120
which are pain relievers,
um,
among other things.

1082
01:01:35.121 --> 01:01:39.950
And then I turn around and I run back downhill trying to move my feet faster

1083
01:01:39.951 --> 01:01:42.260
than they would normally move without gravity.
Right?

1084
01:01:42.261 --> 01:01:44.480
So they're big leaps down that mountain.

1085
01:01:44.900 --> 01:01:47.150
Whenever you take a risk you get dopamine.

1086
01:01:48.020 --> 01:01:51.800
And so by the time on back down on my path and I'm walking home,

1087
01:01:51.980 --> 01:01:56.660
I've mimicked all essentially a bunch of the neurobiology of flow.

1088
01:01:56.661 --> 01:01:59.240
It's not 100%,
it doesn't work all the time,

1089
01:01:59.570 --> 01:02:02.450
but pretty much it'll put you into a low grade flow state.

1090
01:02:02.690 --> 01:02:06.770
And I do this between work sessions and it takes,
you know,

1091
01:02:06.860 --> 01:02:11.300
about 45 minutes and I try to like do my problem solving on the way home cause

1092
01:02:11.301 --> 01:02:14.540
I'm in a low grade flow state and I've got heightened learning and creativity

1093
01:02:14.541 --> 01:02:18.110
and pattern recognition.
And so if there was something that I wasn't doing in my,

1094
01:02:18.140 --> 01:02:20.430
you know,
writing,
I got stuck somewhere.

1095
01:02:20.580 --> 01:02:22.560
That's when I try to solve it because I'm going to,

1096
01:02:22.561 --> 01:02:23.970
I know I'm going to be in a low grade close date.

1097
01:02:24.720 --> 01:02:27.300
I think that's a great place to end.
Thanks guys.
