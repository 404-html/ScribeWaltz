1
00:00:08.110 --> 00:00:08.920
I'm Nick Shelton.

2
00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:11.740
I'm one of the volunteers for the grasp Christian group at Google.

3
00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:16.480
And what we've tried to do is have a monthly speaker series where our goal is to

4
00:00:16.481 --> 00:00:20.680
say,
to bring in speakers who answered questions that Google can't answer.
Uh,

5
00:00:20.681 --> 00:00:25.360
and so for this must stock,
we've invited Dr Josh.
Ash lasts to come and join us.

6
00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:28.300
So I figured I would give a brief intro to him.

7
00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:31.630
I'll let you know a little bit more about his work and then give it over to him

8
00:00:31.631 --> 00:00:33.370
to offer the rest of the presentation.

9
00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.560
So Dr Jeffress loss as a senior scholar at the Bio Logos Foundation and a

10
00:00:38.561 --> 00:00:42.460
distinguished professor and TB Walker,
chair of biology at Westmont College,

11
00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:45.850
which he also directs the Center for faith ethics in life sciences.

12
00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:51.570
After his undergraduate studies in biology and philosophy on a solo programming

13
00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:54.850
cramming four years of undergraduate study into eight,

14
00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:56.410
I'll let him explain that one.

15
00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:01.540
A Jeffery or received his PhD in ecology evolutionary biology from Washington

16
00:01:01.541 --> 00:01:06.541
University and has since been a den for follow across from a fellow at the

17
00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:08.883
University of Notre Dame.
A,

18
00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:12.580
I'm a fellow at Saint Anne's college at Oxford and a weather spool fellow and

19
00:01:12.581 --> 00:01:16.920
theology and science at the Princeton Center of theological inquiry.
Um,

20
00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:20.300
his current research focuses on,
uh,

21
00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:24.970
interactively influence human social cooperation and his own work.

22
00:01:24.971 --> 00:01:28.390
Jeff is especially interested in helping the Christian and Soca secular public

23
00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:29.860
appreciate the merchant findings,

24
00:01:29.861 --> 00:01:34.210
a science and is fostering collegial commerce between scholars with differing

25
00:01:34.211 --> 00:01:37.870
and no religious beliefs,
perfectly significant,
um,

26
00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:42.370
and for ways of keeping his own sanity and closes on interest of surfing.

27
00:01:42.371 --> 00:01:46.770
And so sophomore cutie mark.
Well that said,
I will give it over to Jeff to us.
Uh,

28
00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.913
tell us more.

29
00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:52.793
<v 0>Okay,</v>

30
00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:58.520
<v 2>that's great to be with you this afternoon.
I want to explore,
uh,
a conversation,</v>

31
00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:59.150
uh,

32
00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:04.150
centuries old conversation that has sometimes been synergistically celebrative

33
00:02:05.481 --> 00:02:10.160
and sometimes been acrimoniously polarizing a,

34
00:02:10.161 --> 00:02:12.260
that's a conversation between science and religion.

35
00:02:12.261 --> 00:02:15.860
And I want to begin by telling you a story and I hope it's okay to just give you

36
00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.810
a little personal story here.

37
00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:20.960
I'm holding my three and a half year old son,

38
00:02:20.961 --> 00:02:25.961
Gabe and my arms one evening and we walk out the door to our house.

39
00:02:26.091 --> 00:02:29.360
We live in Santa Barbara.
Um,
we don't get great sunsets in Santa Barbara,

40
00:02:29.361 --> 00:02:33.110
often cause the maritime fog.
But this sunset was spectacular.

41
00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.440
The Sky was hemispherically ablaze.

42
00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:41.420
I've never really considered what it's like for a little kid to notice something

43
00:02:41.421 --> 00:02:44.330
for the first time about the natural world that we see all the time.

44
00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:46.640
But this was for the first time,

45
00:02:46.641 --> 00:02:50.450
gave notice the sunset and I'm holding him in my arms in his head,

46
00:02:50.451 --> 00:02:54.680
turns to me his lips were quivering and he says,
Daddy,
look,

47
00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:57.380
God painted the sky.

48
00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.130
Is it touching back kind of a painful moment.
Cause I had to say,

49
00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.400
gave that stupid God had nothing to do with it.

50
00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:11.500
That's just the differential elastic scattering of light.
No,

51
00:03:11.501 --> 00:03:14.140
of course I did not say that.
Um,

52
00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.880
but I tell you the story to kind of illustrate two points that we're going to

53
00:03:18.881 --> 00:03:23.260
run with and this lecture.
And the first one was,
well,
was it stupid?

54
00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.060
Um,
when we come up with a naturalistic explanation for things,

55
00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.380
does that subvert the rational warrant for thinking that there's something

56
00:03:32.381 --> 00:03:36.880
beyond nature?
Uh,
and the second one is well gave,

57
00:03:36.881 --> 00:03:41.200
wasn't doing an analysis and the inference of,
to the best explanation,

58
00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:44.620
he saw this and he just immediately intuitively

59
00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:48.700
attributed it to God.

60
00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:52.990
So that second question is where does these intuitions come from?

61
00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:54.760
And over 300 years ago

62
00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:58.453
<v 3>not working,</v>

63
00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:03.350
<v 2>uh,
the,
the Scottish philosopher David Hume says in his,
um,</v>

64
00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:07.550
natural history of religion is every inquiry which regards religion is of utmost

65
00:04:07.551 --> 00:04:08.384
importance.

66
00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:13.700
There are two questions in particular which challenge our attention to wit that

67
00:04:13.701 --> 00:04:18.701
concerning its foundation in reason and that concerning its origin in human

68
00:04:19.371 --> 00:04:23.100
nature.
Now for the last more than three centuries,
Ma,

69
00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:27.430
most of the discussion has focused on that first one.
What implication?

70
00:04:27.431 --> 00:04:32.431
So science have for rational warrant the foundations of religious belief in

71
00:04:32.541 --> 00:04:37.340
reason.
But recently,
actually just within the last several decades,

72
00:04:37.341 --> 00:04:40.730
there's been an explosion of research in to the second question.

73
00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:44.860
What is it in human nature,
if anything that disposes this?

74
00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:47.390
So those kinds of beliefs,
uh,

75
00:04:47.391 --> 00:04:52.010
and there have been scarley and popular studies and genetics,

76
00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:57.470
neuroscience,
cognitive science and evolutionary theory.

77
00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:01.130
I want to concentrate on this ladder question with you.

78
00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:05.720
What is it in human nature that seems disposed to these kinds of beliefs.

79
00:05:05.721 --> 00:05:10.250
But in order to do that,
I need to set the context a and

80
00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:14.440
the first question,
foundations and reasons.
So there's,

81
00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:19.830
there's a popular perception that somehow the enterprises of scientific inquiry

82
00:05:20.261 --> 00:05:23.790
and religious faith are intrinsically opposed.
Um,

83
00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:27.850
a few years ago there was a theme issue in Time Magazine,

84
00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:32.560
Richard Dawkins and Francis Collins,
both weight in Francis Collins,

85
00:05:32.561 --> 00:05:34.210
the head of the human genome project,

86
00:05:34.211 --> 00:05:37.750
and now the director of the National Institutes of health.
Um,

87
00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:39.420
he actually founded by a logo.

88
00:05:39.421 --> 00:05:42.820
So the organization with which I have an appointment,
um,

89
00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:45.910
but it's not just popular controversy.

90
00:05:45.911 --> 00:05:50.860
So here's one of dozens of quotes I can give you.
This one from John Dupre,

91
00:05:50.861 --> 00:05:54.520
formerly up the road and the Department of Philosophy at Stanford,
uh,

92
00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:59.510
Japan says Darwin undermines the only remotely plausible reason for believing in

93
00:05:59.511 --> 00:06:03.230
the existence of God.
There's nothing worthwhile,
uh,

94
00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:08.060
left of the argument from design and more controversially where contentiously I

95
00:06:08.061 --> 00:06:10.820
want to insist that without the argument from design,

96
00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:15.920
there's nothing very credible left of fee as in generally and Christianity in

97
00:06:15.921 --> 00:06:16.754
particular.

98
00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:21.800
Now I want to set aside the question of whether in fact the rational warrants

99
00:06:21.801 --> 00:06:25.670
for faith rests on the argument from desire and turned that there are lots of

100
00:06:25.671 --> 00:06:29.390
other arguments,
the argument from pers cause and the cosmological argument.

101
00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:31.790
There are other reasons.
For example,

102
00:06:31.791 --> 00:06:34.520
first person testimony or religious experience,

103
00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:39.710
whether or not all of those are adequate is uh,
another question.

104
00:06:39.711 --> 00:06:40.240
But it's,

105
00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:44.420
it's not clear that faith ever rested entirely on the argument from design.

106
00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:47.480
But more than that,

107
00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:52.160
I want to look at this second comment that Darwin destroys the argument from

108
00:06:52.161 --> 00:06:55.640
design and it turns out there's some merit to that,

109
00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:57.620
but it's not that simple.

110
00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:03.200
There is a tradition of two types of design attribution.

111
00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:09.070
One type looks at the natural processes of the world and in a sense it reasons

112
00:07:09.881 --> 00:07:14.881
when their deficiency says that natural processes are not able to account for

113
00:07:15.411 --> 00:07:17.390
the observations that we make in nature.

114
00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:20.480
And therefore there must be a supernatural intervener.

115
00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:24.830
But there's another tradition all together that looks not at the deficiencies of

116
00:07:24.831 --> 00:07:29.090
nature,
but the marvelous endowments of natural law.

117
00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:34.250
So Newton was speaking in this tradition when he said the most beautiful system

118
00:07:34.251 --> 00:07:38.030
of the sun planets and comets could only proceed when the council and dominion

119
00:07:38.031 --> 00:07:42.440
of an intelligent being whom I call the Lord God.
Now,

120
00:07:42.441 --> 00:07:45.710
that might be an argument,
not be an argument.
Actually it's an attribution,

121
00:07:45.890 --> 00:07:48.530
but maybe that's kind of like Gabe and the sunset.

122
00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:53.240
Maybe that was just the response and intuitive response by Newton since him.

123
00:07:53.241 --> 00:07:57.860
However,
uh,
a number of arguments have been merged called pine tuning arguments.

124
00:07:57.861 --> 00:07:59.210
I'm sure you've heard of them before,

125
00:07:59.211 --> 00:08:01.740
but looking at fundamental constants of nature,
uh,

126
00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:04.160
like the gravitational constant number of others,

127
00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:09.320
which couldn't have differed by plus or minus more than a few percent in order

128
00:08:09.321 --> 00:08:13.400
to have a licensed staining universe.
Paul Davies,

129
00:08:13.401 --> 00:08:15.740
the physicists that Arizona State,

130
00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:18.650
Arizona state calls it the goldilocks enigma.

131
00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:22.040
One of my favorites is this one.
Uh,

132
00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:24.740
it's not a continent of a natural law.

133
00:08:24.741 --> 00:08:27.560
It's actually the initial conditions on which laws work,

134
00:08:27.980 --> 00:08:29.930
the initial mass density of the universe.

135
00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:34.490
So this is from a Ned,
right?
Ucla,

136
00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:36.410
cosmologists and astrophysicists.

137
00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:41.280
And he posits that the initial death mask,
NC,

138
00:08:41.290 --> 00:08:45.710
the universe was fine tuned to one out of 10,
20 to the 24th,

139
00:08:45.711 --> 00:08:50.210
or we're a septillion.
Actually,
he's revised this and added another digit,

140
00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:53.930
um,
and one part greater.

141
00:08:53.990 --> 00:08:58.110
And we would now be in the great collapse.
In other words,
we wouldn't be living.

142
00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:03.920
And this notion of fine tuned to one out of 10 to the 24 is approximately

143
00:09:04.501 --> 00:09:07.740
equivalent to plus or minus one scar.

144
00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:13.080
Not In the night sky that we see you in our galaxy,
but in all the galaxies.

145
00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:17.520
And he read scriptures that say,

146
00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:21.510
lift up your eyes and look to the heavens who created all these.

147
00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:26.700
He who brings out our story host one by one and calls forth each of them by name

148
00:09:27.450 --> 00:09:30.870
because of his great power in mighty strength,
not one of them is missing.

149
00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:35.400
And the psalmist says he determines the number of the stars and calls them each

150
00:09:35.401 --> 00:09:38.550
by name.
Now I want to be really clear here.

151
00:09:39.330 --> 00:09:43.680
I am not suggesting,
although some of my co-religionists do,

152
00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:49.550
that this was a prophecy of what science would discover thousands of years

153
00:09:49.771 --> 00:09:52.620
before the sciences were even invented.
Uh,

154
00:09:53.250 --> 00:09:54.780
I'm not positing dad at all.

155
00:09:55.590 --> 00:09:59.280
I am suggesting that what's here in the scriptural view of the world is that the

156
00:09:59.281 --> 00:10:04.281
world is in fact a cosmos and not a Keto os to use a Greek notions that the

157
00:10:07.291 --> 00:10:09.040
world and the cosmos we live in,

158
00:10:09.041 --> 00:10:14.041
it in fact is structured and designed not designed because the laws require

159
00:10:15.331 --> 00:10:16.620
supernatural intervention,

160
00:10:16.621 --> 00:10:21.621
but decide because the laws themselves seem tuned to what would be necessary for

161
00:10:23.521 --> 00:10:28.100
the rise of life.
And it's not just the scripture.
So a number of scientists have,

162
00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:30.750
uh,
who have no faith in God by the way.

163
00:10:30.751 --> 00:10:35.610
So Fred Hoyle was an atheist who said a common sense interpretation of the facts

164
00:10:35.611 --> 00:10:39.450
suggest that a super intellect as monkeyed with physics as well as chemistry and

165
00:10:39.451 --> 00:10:42.240
biology and up the road here,

166
00:10:42.350 --> 00:10:46.710
a Leonard self scan at Stanford co-developer of string theory says our own

167
00:10:46.711 --> 00:10:51.630
universe is an extraordinary place that appears to be fantastically well

168
00:10:51.631 --> 00:10:53.370
designed for our own existence.

169
00:10:54.090 --> 00:10:58.140
This specialness is not something that we can attribute to lucky accidents,

170
00:10:58.141 --> 00:10:59.700
which is far too unlikely.

171
00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:03.720
The apparent coincidence is cry out for an explanation.

172
00:11:05.430 --> 00:11:07.500
Now here and each of the major points,

173
00:11:07.501 --> 00:11:11.880
I want to make this this afternoon here,
I need to interject a but,

174
00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:13.441
and it's a big,

175
00:11:13.441 --> 00:11:18.090
but actually this quote that I just read you from Suskind is often taken out of

176
00:11:18.091 --> 00:11:22.860
context.
Suskin does say that our universe is a special place,

177
00:11:23.310 --> 00:11:25.320
but this quote is taken from his book,

178
00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:30.380
the subtitle of which string theory and the illusion of intelligent design.

179
00:11:31.410 --> 00:11:34.770
So he thinks our universe is a remarkably special place,

180
00:11:34.771 --> 00:11:38.730
but our university isn't the only universe that there are many,
many,
many,

181
00:11:38.731 --> 00:11:43.731
many next door universes greatly amplifying the probability that we'd get a

182
00:11:44.251 --> 00:11:46.140
universe that would support life.

183
00:11:46.890 --> 00:11:51.090
There are various permutations of multiverse theory or mega verse theory.

184
00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:53.070
And the point I want to make here,

185
00:11:56.050 --> 00:12:00.490
the question doesn't settle.
So the book of Job Actually,

186
00:12:01.490 --> 00:12:05.050
um,
I'm really moved by the fact that in the Hebrew scriptures,

187
00:12:05.051 --> 00:12:09.670
the book of Joe Contains Friends of job who are giving arguments for God.

188
00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:14.770
And at the end they get rebuked by God for defending him with quote unquote

189
00:12:14.830 --> 00:12:18.550
proverbs of ashes.
So I didn't want to make that mistake.

190
00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:23.290
These fine tuning arguments aren't slam dunks.
There's ongoing debate,

191
00:12:24.190 --> 00:12:29.190
but it's also not the case that somehow Darwin settled the issue and subverted

192
00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:34.810
all arguments from design.
One of my favorite thinkers,
Pascal.

193
00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:36.520
But at this way,
he says,

194
00:12:36.521 --> 00:12:41.170
there's enough light to see that there's something there worth seeing,

195
00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:45.580
but not enough light to see it clearly by our natural reason.

196
00:12:46.570 --> 00:12:51.190
He goes on to say,
if there were no obscurity,
man would not feed,

197
00:12:51.191 --> 00:12:54.940
feel this need.
If there were no light,
man would not hope for a cure.

198
00:12:55.570 --> 00:13:00.310
All appearance indicates neither a total exclusion or manifest presence of

199
00:13:00.311 --> 00:13:03.550
divinity.
We must not see nothing at all nor math.

200
00:13:03.551 --> 00:13:05.860
We see sufficient to believe that we possess it,

201
00:13:06.370 --> 00:13:11.260
but we must see enough to know that we have lost it.
But to know of our loss,

202
00:13:11.740 --> 00:13:16.660
we must see a Nazi.
And that's precisely the state in which we natural.

203
00:13:16.750 --> 00:13:19.330
Lee are the picture here.

204
00:13:19.890 --> 00:13:23.020
And I think this is the picture of the Christian faith,

205
00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:27.070
is that you're not an idiot for believing in God.

206
00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:29.620
It's a plausible hypothesis.

207
00:13:30.220 --> 00:13:35.220
But what might persuade any of us that there is a god re requires reason is

208
00:13:38.141 --> 00:13:40.180
necessary but not sufficient.

209
00:13:41.620 --> 00:13:44.770
So this strange verse in the book of Romans,
Paul says,

210
00:13:44.771 --> 00:13:48.970
his spirit testifies with our spirit that we are God's children.

211
00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:53.080
There's something about the actual experience of the presence of God that's

212
00:13:53.081 --> 00:13:57.310
important.
Um,
that may be delusional,

213
00:13:58.270 --> 00:14:01.030
that I think I'd rather be delusional,
being dishonest.

214
00:14:01.210 --> 00:14:05.710
I don't want to defend God with problems of ashes.
Okay,
so now we have this,

215
00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:08.590
this question then,
where do these intuitions come from?

216
00:14:09.100 --> 00:14:13.360
And here's the second part,
the origin in human nature.

217
00:14:16.270 --> 00:14:17.920
There's a couple of ways of looking at this.

218
00:14:17.970 --> 00:14:21.370
I'm biologist talk about proximate cause of an ultimate causes.

219
00:14:21.410 --> 00:14:25.990
Proximate causes would be the mechanism that generates certain features,

220
00:14:26.140 --> 00:14:30.880
including a mental dispositions and ultimate,

221
00:14:30.970 --> 00:14:35.920
uh,
would be well of what adaptive value of if any is it.

222
00:14:36.010 --> 00:14:40.720
So there's been a tremendous explosion in cognitive science of looking at

223
00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:43.690
fundamental dispositions or intuitive,
uh,

224
00:14:43.691 --> 00:14:47.800
dispositions towards certain kinds of beliefs that we might associate with God

225
00:14:47.801 --> 00:14:49.510
or religious beliefs.
And by the way,

226
00:14:49.511 --> 00:14:54.440
one of the really exciting things about this field is it's incredibly
ecumenical.

227
00:14:54.900 --> 00:14:55.160
Uh,

228
00:14:55.160 --> 00:15:00.160
it has Jews and Christians and Muslims and Jews who are practicing but don't

229
00:15:00.891 --> 00:15:05.530
believe in God,
atheist,
virulent,
and nine,
uh,

230
00:15:05.540 --> 00:15:07.580
we're all collaborating with each other.
It's up.

231
00:15:07.670 --> 00:15:11.450
It's a fun moment right now of non acrimonious discussion.

232
00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:16.920
So,
um,
just for example,
um,
Justin Barrett

233
00:15:19.110 --> 00:15:24.110
working,
uh,
Justin Barrett is a cognitive science.
This formerly,
uh,

234
00:15:24.860 --> 00:15:29.300
Oxford,
uh,
APP,
the Institute for Cognition and culture.

235
00:15:29.900 --> 00:15:32.870
And,
uh,
Jesse bearing is,

236
00:15:35.130 --> 00:15:35.963
is a

237
00:15:38.930 --> 00:15:43.760
sweet spirited but a very emphatic atheists.

238
00:15:43.790 --> 00:15:46.660
Jesse says somewhat tongue in cheek,
but not all together.

239
00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:52.190
We've got God by the throat and I won't stop until one of us is dead.

240
00:15:52.970 --> 00:15:56.960
So he's wrestling with big issues.
Uh,
and here's some,

241
00:15:57.050 --> 00:16:00.740
here's some work that Jesse did and so on.
Afterlife beliefs and children.

242
00:16:01.310 --> 00:16:06.080
So he brings children in to the lab and he does a puppet show with an alligator

243
00:16:06.230 --> 00:16:09.590
and a mouse.
And there's a story about the mouth.
Mouth wants to go home,

244
00:16:09.591 --> 00:16:14.030
could be with his mother and he's feeling a little tired and he's hungry and

245
00:16:14.031 --> 00:16:17.600
then the alligator eats the mouse.
Uh,

246
00:16:17.810 --> 00:16:21.980
and then the children are sent off for grief counseling.
Uh,
no,

247
00:16:21.981 --> 00:16:23.000
that's not true.

248
00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:28.300
That children are asked a series of questions about is there any continuity

249
00:16:29.331 --> 00:16:33.800
between the mouse that was in the mouse that now is and they're told that mouse

250
00:16:33.801 --> 00:16:38.660
is not alive anymore.
The alligator ate it.
So first of all,

251
00:16:38.690 --> 00:16:42.020
a biological questions,
does the mouse still need to eat?

252
00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:46.070
Still need to go to the bathroom cause the mouse's ears still work.

253
00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:50.840
And the overwhelming majority of kids get that at death.

254
00:16:50.870 --> 00:16:55.010
Your biological functions don't continue.
Although first,
uh,

255
00:16:55.011 --> 00:16:55.880
although kindergarten,

256
00:16:55.881 --> 00:17:00.740
it was about a quarter of them still say yes to these questions.
Second graders,

257
00:17:01.100 --> 00:17:04.280
90% of them go.
Only one out of 10 says yes.

258
00:17:04.910 --> 00:17:08.870
But then amp it up a little bit.
Psycho biological question.

259
00:17:08.871 --> 00:17:11.060
Not does a mouse need to aid,

260
00:17:12.230 --> 00:17:17.220
but does the mouse have the feeling of being hungry,
thirsty or sleepy?
Um,

261
00:17:17.250 --> 00:17:22.010
this one,
uh,
two thirds of the kindergartener said yes and fully of the third,

262
00:17:22.011 --> 00:17:23.600
and the second graders say yes,

263
00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:29.000
and you have to get to fifth or sixth grade until you truncate continuity.

264
00:17:29.630 --> 00:17:31.910
And about 90% of the sixth graders said No.

265
00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:36.470
Now here's what's really interesting.
Lastly,

266
00:17:36.530 --> 00:17:39.200
a different kind of questioned all together,
uh,

267
00:17:39.201 --> 00:17:41.630
involving desires and feelings.

268
00:17:42.620 --> 00:17:46.220
Does a mouse still want to go home?
Still loves his mom.

269
00:17:46.970 --> 00:17:50.250
Mouse still believes that his mom is the nicest grownup,

270
00:17:51.150 --> 00:17:53.850
the overwhelming majority of kindergarteners.
Ren

271
00:17:55.890 --> 00:17:59.120
Fifth graders,
half of them say yes.

272
00:18:00.350 --> 00:18:02.710
And what surprises me a little bit.
Um,

273
00:18:02.780 --> 00:18:05.960
he brought in college students for this question and about a third of the

274
00:18:05.961 --> 00:18:09.850
college students to the various items said yes.
Um,

275
00:18:10.550 --> 00:18:15.200
and the ones that said no,
there is a latency.
Uh,

276
00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:19.340
and their response when asked about the biological questions,
they said no.

277
00:18:19.460 --> 00:18:24.380
Immediately when asked about the beliefs,
feelings,
and desires,
questions,

278
00:18:24.710 --> 00:18:28.790
even the ones who said no,
uh,
there was a latency and they're answering.

279
00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:34.670
So the psychologist at Yale,

280
00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:39.800
Paul Bloom and editor of the Journal of Behavioral and Brain Sciences uses the

281
00:18:39.801 --> 00:18:42.580
term natural born dualist,
um,

282
00:18:42.660 --> 00:18:45.590
blue and believes that we're not taught these things.

283
00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:49.700
If there's a natural disposition to think of life as enduring death,

284
00:18:49.730 --> 00:18:53.930
maybe not all together in party.
Here's one other one.

285
00:18:57.080 --> 00:19:01.450
How about purpose?
The attribution of purpose,
the things,
uh,

286
00:19:01.460 --> 00:19:05.940
the inclination to think teleologically Deb Kellerman,
uh,

287
00:19:05.990 --> 00:19:10.990
the psychologists have looked at this behavior in children and she asked

288
00:19:11.631 --> 00:19:15.560
questions like,
why did the first bird exist?
Welcome Mike.

289
00:19:15.561 --> 00:19:18.800
Nice music and be cleat because it makes the world look nice.

290
00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:21.770
Why did the first monkey exists?

291
00:19:22.490 --> 00:19:27.490
So then we had somebody to climb trees so there can be an animal in the jungle.

292
00:19:29.870 --> 00:19:34.580
Why did the first monkey exist?
Oh,

293
00:19:34.581 --> 00:19:36.800
I already did that.
Why did the first river exists?

294
00:19:36.801 --> 00:19:40.850
So boats can come in the water and so that people can do fishing.

295
00:19:42.170 --> 00:19:45.290
Telemann calls children intuitive fist.

296
00:19:45.740 --> 00:19:50.340
But the interesting thing is she's followed up on these studies with adults,
uh,

297
00:19:50.630 --> 00:19:54.710
including by the way doctorally trained academics,
uh,

298
00:19:54.820 --> 00:19:57.390
a number in the natural sciences.
Uh,

299
00:19:57.810 --> 00:20:02.810
and there's still this late and disposition to think teleologically uh,

300
00:20:03.470 --> 00:20:07.220
and adults.
Now what there isn't there.
These,

301
00:20:07.340 --> 00:20:09.680
these features May,
I guess,

302
00:20:09.681 --> 00:20:12.950
embodied being is in Jesse's work,

303
00:20:13.130 --> 00:20:16.170
intuitive theosis or,
uh,

304
00:20:16.370 --> 00:20:19.100
purpose orientation and kill him his work.

305
00:20:19.101 --> 00:20:22.610
These attributes are attributes of God.
Um,

306
00:20:22.700 --> 00:20:25.230
but when she calls children intuitive theist,

307
00:20:25.270 --> 00:20:30.270
the one thing that is lacking there that exists in most concepts in the current,

308
00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:35.120
uh,
world monotheism is a sacred dimension.

309
00:20:35.930 --> 00:20:39.800
So these concepts could be true of leprechauns for that,

310
00:20:39.801 --> 00:20:42.110
but there's something about a sacred dimension and that's,

311
00:20:42.170 --> 00:20:46.640
that's something that hasn't been much studied in the current cognitive science

312
00:20:46.641 --> 00:20:50.040
of religion.
Nevertheless,
it's really true that we,

313
00:20:50.220 --> 00:20:52.900
we have this disposition to think in terms of purpose.

314
00:20:52.901 --> 00:20:57.010
Richard Dawkins himself says,
we humans have purpose on the brain.

315
00:20:57.860 --> 00:21:02.560
The mere fact that it's possible to frame a question doesn't make it legitimate

316
00:21:02.561 --> 00:21:04.120
or sensible to do so.

317
00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:09.840
You have no right to assume the why question deserves an answer when posed about

318
00:21:11.351 --> 00:21:15.310
a boulder misfortune now in avarice or the universe.

319
00:21:16.420 --> 00:21:18.610
Now it's interesting here,
um,

320
00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:26.560
Dawkins says and give a reason why no one has a right to ask that question.

321
00:21:27.460 --> 00:21:30.530
Uh,
he takes it as a given and in fact,

322
00:21:30.860 --> 00:21:35.860
this seems to emerge out of a fundamental and profound intuition on his part

323
00:21:36.320 --> 00:21:39.140
that there is no purpose.
So in one sense,

324
00:21:39.141 --> 00:21:42.230
we have a battling intuitions here.
Uh,

325
00:21:42.231 --> 00:21:45.890
although it might seem to you like we'll surely we can't think of in terms of a

326
00:21:45.891 --> 00:21:49.310
purpose of a mountain,
but as we grow older,

327
00:21:49.311 --> 00:21:54.311
it may be the case that we are more parsimonious in what we attribute purchase a

328
00:21:54.460 --> 00:21:55.310
purpose too,

329
00:21:56.030 --> 00:22:01.030
but also more expansive and elevating in terms of how we construe purpose.

330
00:22:01.910 --> 00:22:05.360
So if you want to think in terms of the purpose of a mountain,
for example,

331
00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:06.860
this isn't a religious statement,

332
00:22:08.390 --> 00:22:12.050
but I'd highly recommend reading John Muir's,
uh,

333
00:22:12.140 --> 00:22:16.610
the mountains of California or his,
my first summer in the Sierra.

334
00:22:18.170 --> 00:22:22.070
There's a reverential elevation of these entities,
uh,

335
00:22:22.100 --> 00:22:26.530
not just in an in an aesthetic sense,
but in some sense,
uh,

336
00:22:26.900 --> 00:22:31.130
in terms of the larger teleology,
okay,

337
00:22:36.290 --> 00:22:37.370
whatever in the case,

338
00:22:38.270 --> 00:22:42.380
the cognitive sciences suggest that we have an eight distribute disposition to

339
00:22:42.410 --> 00:22:45.260
attribute and not just to attribute,

340
00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:50.750
but to yearn for purpose.
Augustine says,

341
00:22:50.751 --> 00:22:55.640
you have made us for yourself and the heart is restless until it finds its rest

342
00:22:55.760 --> 00:22:57.830
in you.
Now,

343
00:22:58.160 --> 00:23:02.720
the first question is a theological statement you have made us for yourself.

344
00:23:02.810 --> 00:23:06.650
The second question is a psychological statement that our heart is hearts are

345
00:23:06.651 --> 00:23:10.420
restless.
Uh,
and so why,
uh,

346
00:23:10.910 --> 00:23:12.170
why would that be the case?

347
00:23:12.590 --> 00:23:15.710
And now I'm going to take a step back and ask the evolutionary question.

348
00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:20.960
Why would creatures have these dispositions?
And there again,

349
00:23:20.961 --> 00:23:25.961
there's an explosion of evolutionary literature on cognitive dispositions toward

350
00:23:26.571 --> 00:23:30.500
religious belief.
There's been a fascinating debate,
by the way.

351
00:23:31.220 --> 00:23:34.520
So some argue that we don't have those dispositions,

352
00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:39.230
that religion is a cultural pathogen that infects our brains.

353
00:23:39.231 --> 00:23:43.940
Richard Dawkins says,
religion is a virus more deadly than the smallpox virus.

354
00:23:43.940 --> 00:23:47.810
Bit more difficult to
a other say.

355
00:23:48.860 --> 00:23:53.090
We'll know given the empirical work,
um,
there may be cultural constructs,

356
00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:55.670
but our brain is very receptive to these.

357
00:23:56.150 --> 00:24:01.150
And in fact our brain is disposed to construct these cultural notions.

358
00:24:01.820 --> 00:24:05.870
But it's not adaptive.
It's a byproduct.

359
00:24:06.020 --> 00:24:10.130
It's an incidental byproduct of other cognitive mechanisms that do have adaptive

360
00:24:10.131 --> 00:24:14.970
function.
And of course,
a third position in this debate is,
no,

361
00:24:14.980 --> 00:24:17.120
it may be a byproduct,
but human culture has,

362
00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:22.250
has learned how to use these dispositions for the flourishing of culture.

363
00:24:22.760 --> 00:24:26.300
Now I want to focus on this last perspective,
um,

364
00:24:27.470 --> 00:24:30.470
in part because it's one that I've been working on for the last decade,

365
00:24:30.830 --> 00:24:34.580
but I actually think it's would be accurate to say that there's emerging

366
00:24:34.581 --> 00:24:36.050
consensus,
uh,

367
00:24:36.051 --> 00:24:40.580
and the cognitive and anthropological evolutionary sciences of,
of religion.

368
00:24:41.300 --> 00:24:42.410
So here we go.
Ah,

369
00:24:42.420 --> 00:24:46.760
I'll set the context with something that virtually everyone agrees on.

370
00:24:47.780 --> 00:24:51.530
So here's an article from the philosophical transactions of the Royal Society.

371
00:24:51.531 --> 00:24:56.531
Human cooperation exceeds that of all other species with regard to the scale and

372
00:24:57.171 --> 00:24:58.340
range of activities.

373
00:24:58.341 --> 00:25:02.150
Human beings cooperate with individuals that are not genetic,

374
00:25:02.180 --> 00:25:06.080
genetically related and that are outside,
uh,

375
00:25:06.180 --> 00:25:10.580
the group boundaries of face to face historically,
uh,

376
00:25:10.581 --> 00:25:12.320
remembered interactions.

377
00:25:12.680 --> 00:25:17.680
And we're the only creatures that do that systematically 40 years ago now.

378
00:25:18.381 --> 00:25:21.350
And as seminal sociobiology Eo Wilson says,

379
00:25:21.351 --> 00:25:26.240
man has achieved an extraordinary degree of cooperation exactly how he alone has

380
00:25:26.241 --> 00:25:31.040
been able to cross to this.
Pinnacle is the culminating mystery of all biology.

381
00:25:32.090 --> 00:25:35.480
Well,
that was 40 years ago.
Uh,
and we have,

382
00:25:35.481 --> 00:25:39.130
this would be a talking in and of itself,
but we've come up with,
uh,

383
00:25:39.530 --> 00:25:43.580
numerous fascinating and really plausible explanations for this,

384
00:25:43.581 --> 00:25:48.200
but I'm going to concentrate on one.
We'll start with this.

385
00:25:49.430 --> 00:25:51.780
It's obvious that in human cultures,
um,

386
00:25:51.860 --> 00:25:56.450
and actually another socially organisms of punishment is important.

387
00:25:57.910 --> 00:25:59.510
So one of the,

388
00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:05.030
one of the aspects of human cooperation that is so difficult to sustain because

389
00:26:05.031 --> 00:26:09.350
it's so open to defection is not me cooperating with nick.

390
00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:12.740
If I burn him,
he won't work with me.
But they happen.

391
00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:17.540
It involves common goods,
uh,
where large,
uh,

392
00:26:17.570 --> 00:26:22.570
members of a large community invest in and take from a pool of shared resources.

393
00:26:23.481 --> 00:26:27.410
And the community can become so large that you get pre riders,

394
00:26:27.530 --> 00:26:31.370
you get people who don't make their investment or you get people who take more,

395
00:26:31.430 --> 00:26:33.170
uh,
than is their share.

396
00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:36.740
A Garrett Hardin called this the tragedy of the Commons.

397
00:26:38.030 --> 00:26:40.610
But punishment can constrain this.

398
00:26:40.611 --> 00:26:45.540
So here's a common goods game running the lab where people are given certain

399
00:26:45.541 --> 00:26:49.290
monetary endowment,
you put it in the pool,
it triples,

400
00:26:49.530 --> 00:26:52.830
and then you divided equally amongst everybody in the game,

401
00:26:52.860 --> 00:26:57.090
including by the white people who didn't contribute anything.
And as you can see,

402
00:26:57.091 --> 00:27:01.090
people figure out over time that I'm getting burned by these effectors and an,

403
00:27:01.220 --> 00:27:05.340
and then investment in the common pool goes down but admit punishment,

404
00:27:06.030 --> 00:27:07.380
uh,
and it goes up.

405
00:27:07.890 --> 00:27:11.850
So punishment is really effective in stabilizing cooperation.

406
00:27:11.851 --> 00:27:15.210
But there's some limitations to this idea.
First of all,

407
00:27:15.211 --> 00:27:19.920
punishment costs and the particular game you had to pay to punish,

408
00:27:20.250 --> 00:27:24.200
but in societies punished kind of punishment costs.
If you confront somebody,

409
00:27:24.230 --> 00:27:28.680
they might poke you in the nose.
We have to pay for policemen.
It's not free.

410
00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:29.851
And secondly,

411
00:27:29.851 --> 00:27:34.851
punishment is only as good as the detection is of defectors.

412
00:27:35.940 --> 00:27:40.800
So it's limited by the accuracy of the detection.
And then lastly,

413
00:27:41.040 --> 00:27:43.980
punishers are bribed bubble.
They had their own self interests.

414
00:27:44.610 --> 00:27:49.610
So what we'd want ideally to stabilize cooperation in a society is a,

415
00:27:51.370 --> 00:27:54.330
a moral overseer who's free,

416
00:27:55.170 --> 00:27:59.130
who's omniscient and his unbreakable.
Well,

417
00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:00.860
you see where this is going.
Um,

418
00:28:01.260 --> 00:28:06.260
that's the positive role of believing in supernatural punishment.

419
00:28:07.321 --> 00:28:12.210
So,
um,
the notions here are the rise of moralizing deities,

420
00:28:12.270 --> 00:28:16.380
which by the way is dip,
not all religions.
So in some religions,

421
00:28:17.100 --> 00:28:17.933
um,

422
00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:22.410
proposed the cities that are either not interested in the affairs of humans or

423
00:28:22.411 --> 00:28:25.080
are not viewed as a moral beings themselves.

424
00:28:25.740 --> 00:28:30.740
The rise of moral deity seems to correspond with the extension of the size of

425
00:28:31.531 --> 00:28:35.250
human interaction,
div units and culture with the rise of agriculture.

426
00:28:36.150 --> 00:28:40.500
Um,
but this is certainly not an,
and what novel proposal,
I mean,

427
00:28:40.540 --> 00:28:44.340
Voltaire,
centuries ago said,
if God did not exist,

428
00:28:44.760 --> 00:28:48.000
it would be necessary to invent him.
Now,

429
00:28:48.150 --> 00:28:53.150
some people take this as kind of a sarcastic repudiation of God that he was

430
00:28:53.431 --> 00:28:56.450
invented,
but that's not what Volterra Matt.

431
00:28:56.490 --> 00:29:01.490
Now he was at from a critic of a number of aspects of the Christian tradition,

432
00:29:02.191 --> 00:29:06.420
but he went on to say,
but all nature cries out that he does exist,

433
00:29:06.900 --> 00:29:10.920
that there is a supreme intelligence and immense power and admirable order and

434
00:29:10.921 --> 00:29:13.410
everything teaches us our dependence on it

435
00:29:15.090 --> 00:29:18.960
for a reason of social coherence.
Now,

436
00:29:18.961 --> 00:29:20.510
in the last few years,
um,

437
00:29:20.730 --> 00:29:25.080
there's just been in a rupture of empirical literature testing this hypothesis

438
00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:29.220
and a couple of books,
by the way,
fun books are northern Zions big gods,

439
00:29:29.221 --> 00:29:33.000
how religion transform cooperation and conflict.

440
00:29:33.060 --> 00:29:38.060
And Don Johnson's God is watching you how the fear of God makes us human.

441
00:29:38.610 --> 00:29:41.040
Um,
dom has a dual phd

442
00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:46.180
political science and evolutionary biology.

443
00:29:46.181 --> 00:29:51.130
His appointment is at Oxford.
Uh,
and both these guys are wonderful colleagues.
Uh,

444
00:29:51.190 --> 00:29:55.690
both are atheists.
They have absolutely no religious bro religious agenda,

445
00:29:56.230 --> 00:29:58.720
uh,
but they're persuaded that religious belief,

446
00:29:58.721 --> 00:30:01.920
particularly belief in moralizing gods has been,
uh,

447
00:30:02.260 --> 00:30:07.180
has played a really crucial role in the origin of human culture.
And in fact,

448
00:30:07.181 --> 00:30:10.990
there's some empirical data,
I'll just share a couple with you.

449
00:30:10.991 --> 00:30:12.880
This is from some work that our ed,

450
00:30:12.881 --> 00:30:16.780
yet he brought people in and they played the dictator game where you get certain

451
00:30:16.781 --> 00:30:19.730
amount of money and he'd share as little or as much with uh,

452
00:30:19.980 --> 00:30:23.140
an anonymous partner.
And as they were doing that,

453
00:30:23.141 --> 00:30:25.600
he gave them subliminal primes on the computer.

454
00:30:26.260 --> 00:30:31.260
And when prime with a religious concept like spirit or God or Bible,

455
00:30:33.670 --> 00:30:38.590
uh,
the offers,
uh,
basically doubled.

456
00:30:39.490 --> 00:30:44.490
Now he also used secular police type crimes and it had the same effect.

457
00:30:45.820 --> 00:30:49.570
So no one's saying here that necessarily that religion,

458
00:30:50.440 --> 00:30:53.530
uh,
produces a greater effect.

459
00:30:54.280 --> 00:30:58.630
It's just that there may be other benefits as a backup mechanism is a mechanism

460
00:30:58.631 --> 00:31:02.320
that doesn't have to be paid for.
But does this,

461
00:31:02.710 --> 00:31:03.970
this is in the lab,

462
00:31:04.390 --> 00:31:09.390
is there any data to suggest that actually exerts cultural or social influence?

463
00:31:12.090 --> 00:31:12.530
<v 3>Okay.</v>

464
00:31:12.530 --> 00:31:14.150
<v 2>And my colleague Rich Sosus,</v>

465
00:31:14.151 --> 00:31:18.410
a evolutionary anthropologists that University of Connecticut,
uh,

466
00:31:18.440 --> 00:31:23.440
looked at historical records per 200 religious and secular communes in 19th

467
00:31:23.781 --> 00:31:28.340
century America.
And he found that for every year of their life course,

468
00:31:28.370 --> 00:31:32.090
religious communes were about four times as likely to survive.

469
00:31:32.810 --> 00:31:37.030
So just the survival of communes is tremendously,
uh,

470
00:31:37.310 --> 00:31:41.750
influence by community,
religious identity or lack thereof.

471
00:31:45.660 --> 00:31:46.800
Uh,
and there's rich.

472
00:31:47.910 --> 00:31:48.420
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

473
00:31:48.420 --> 00:31:53.400
<v 2>Now there's limitations here.
And the limitations here are,
I mean,</v>

474
00:31:53.550 --> 00:31:57.180
uh,
here's a Gary Larson cartoon,
but this idea of a punishing,

475
00:31:57.630 --> 00:32:02.630
vengeful God actually may be efficacious and constraining defection,

476
00:32:04.350 --> 00:32:09.350
but what it doesn't seem to be able to do is motivates super auditory.

477
00:32:09.960 --> 00:32:14.960
There's a word from a philosophical ethics motivate behavior that goes above and

478
00:32:15.811 --> 00:32:19.290
beyond the minimal expectations.
So God might this,

479
00:32:19.291 --> 00:32:24.291
God might punish you for doing wrong for violating what you're obligated to do.

480
00:32:25.260 --> 00:32:28.830
But we see people all the time doing what they're not obligated to do.

481
00:32:29.370 --> 00:32:32.160
So you might think of something dramatic like a,
you know,

482
00:32:32.161 --> 00:32:36.180
living a life of poverty and celibacy on behalf of serving the poor.

483
00:32:36.690 --> 00:32:40.510
But it could also be something just as simple as pulling over in a snow storm,

484
00:32:41.110 --> 00:32:45.540
uh,
to help a stranger on the side of the road.
He's going to have a gas.
Um,

485
00:32:45.980 --> 00:32:50.830
so one problem is this doesn't explain superogatory behavior.
Uh,

486
00:32:50.840 --> 00:32:55.160
and another problem he has any society that relies exclusively on belief in God

487
00:32:55.280 --> 00:32:55.631
to do.

488
00:32:55.631 --> 00:33:00.631
It's more a policing ma is vulnerable to infection by people who don't share

489
00:33:01.191 --> 00:33:05.200
that belief.
So here's the next uh,

490
00:33:05.210 --> 00:33:10.060
and current installment.
It's called costly signaling is,
uh,

491
00:33:10.450 --> 00:33:13.260
a long history of biological thing,
uh,

492
00:33:13.490 --> 00:33:16.040
thinking about signaling and nonhuman species.

493
00:33:16.700 --> 00:33:21.700
But the idea here is that one of the ways that a community can assure itself

494
00:33:22.220 --> 00:33:27.220
that interacting members in fact do share these beliefs is by commitment

495
00:33:27.831 --> 00:33:31.400
singling mechanisms,
costly behaviors.
Like for example,

496
00:33:31.401 --> 00:33:36.401
I'm taking one day off every seven and not and not working or giving 10% of your

497
00:33:38.031 --> 00:33:43.031
income of voluntarily or not eating a whole range of food which would otherwise

498
00:33:44.181 --> 00:33:45.080
be available.

499
00:33:45.740 --> 00:33:50.740
Richard's gone back and he's actually gone back to his commune study and looked

500
00:33:50.871 --> 00:33:55.871
at the number of costly costly behaviors and found that conduit commun longevity

501
00:33:58.070 --> 00:34:02.420
increased with an increasing number of costly behaviors.
But by the way,

502
00:34:02.421 --> 00:34:05.660
only for religious,
uh,
comments,
uh,

503
00:34:05.690 --> 00:34:07.510
had no effect on secular continents.

504
00:34:10.720 --> 00:34:11.553
<v 0>Well,</v>

505
00:34:12.470 --> 00:34:15.320
<v 2>that's part of the story.
But there are limitations of this too.</v>

506
00:34:16.910 --> 00:34:18.860
And the limitations are number one,

507
00:34:20.150 --> 00:34:22.340
for a costly signal,

508
00:34:22.430 --> 00:34:26.990
whether it's a peacock's tail or a religious practice,

509
00:34:27.710 --> 00:34:31.580
for it to be sustainable,
although it costs,

510
00:34:32.060 --> 00:34:36.860
it has to be compensated for by the benefit to the,
to the signaler.

511
00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:39.590
If it weren't,
it wouldn't be sustainable.

512
00:34:40.970 --> 00:34:45.970
But now if the cost is compensated for it by the benefit,

513
00:34:47.060 --> 00:34:51.500
then people who don't believe we'd be willing to pay the costs because they get

514
00:34:51.530 --> 00:34:54.890
more out of it.
Uh,
we see this by the way,

515
00:34:54.920 --> 00:34:57.080
and a lower level in American politics.

516
00:34:57.081 --> 00:35:01.880
It's almost impossible to get elected to major political office if you're not a

517
00:35:01.881 --> 00:35:04.070
church goer.
And

518
00:35:08.450 --> 00:35:13.450
I will forego a comment about our current political situation in the u s um,

519
00:35:15.110 --> 00:35:18.380
but that's one problem.
The other problem is this,

520
00:35:19.580 --> 00:35:24.550
the costly signaling hypothesis doesn't,
uh,

521
00:35:24.650 --> 00:35:29.510
engage what does a prominent teaching in many religious traditions,

522
00:35:30.350 --> 00:35:33.830
which is that what you do,
you shouldn't do publicly.

523
00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:37.830
So in the Christian tradition,
for example,
Jesus says,
when you give,

524
00:35:38.280 --> 00:35:43.200
don't give publicly as the hypocrites do,
blasting a trumpet before then,

525
00:35:43.201 --> 00:35:44.940
but given secret back,

526
00:35:44.941 --> 00:35:47.370
don't even let your left hand know what your right hand is doing.

527
00:35:48.300 --> 00:35:51.450
And when you pray,
don't pray publicly as the hypocrites do,

528
00:35:52.530 --> 00:35:54.930
but pray in secret in your closet.

529
00:35:55.560 --> 00:35:59.100
And your father who sees in secret will reward you and secret.

530
00:35:59.850 --> 00:36:04.850
So there's this stream of religious exhortation and back to not do exactly these

531
00:36:06.601 --> 00:36:08.910
public displays of religiosity.

532
00:36:09.840 --> 00:36:13.920
And that brings up the last and final issue.
Yeah,

533
00:36:13.950 --> 00:36:18.600
it's an issue I have to say that is under investigated right now.

534
00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:23.550
But it's the issue of religious experience

535
00:36:26.160 --> 00:36:30.000
in order to motivate us toward superogatory behaviors.

536
00:36:30.030 --> 00:36:32.310
Those that were not absolutely motivate,
uh,

537
00:36:32.370 --> 00:36:37.370
obligated to do or in order to draw us into religious practices that don't

538
00:36:39.510 --> 00:36:41.070
enhance our reputation.

539
00:36:41.760 --> 00:36:46.620
It might be the case that whether it's delusional or not,

540
00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:51.060
a person who believes that they experienced the presence and intimacy and love

541
00:36:51.061 --> 00:36:55.030
of God,
uh,
Mike do these things.
So in the,

542
00:36:55.280 --> 00:36:57.030
in the New Testament,
Paul says,

543
00:36:57.031 --> 00:37:01.620
we comfort others with the comfort we ourselves receive from God.

544
00:37:02.350 --> 00:37:03.870
The last few years,
uh,

545
00:37:04.740 --> 00:37:09.060
my lab has been looking at the relationship between religious experience and

546
00:37:09.061 --> 00:37:14.040
measures of pro sociality,
uh,
trust and generosity.
I've been doing this,

547
00:37:14.041 --> 00:37:14.430
uh,

548
00:37:14.430 --> 00:37:19.430
with Hilary Lindh festy now at the school of human evolution and social change

549
00:37:19.591 --> 00:37:20.610
at Arizona State.

550
00:37:21.150 --> 00:37:26.150
And Paul Zak from the center for new or newer economic studies that at Claremont

551
00:37:27.090 --> 00:37:29.700
Graduate University.
And we have,
we have folks come into the lab,

552
00:37:29.820 --> 00:37:34.290
take a series of inventory just where they self report on their sense of

553
00:37:34.291 --> 00:37:37.260
gratitude,
toward God's sense of intimacy with God,

554
00:37:37.261 --> 00:37:39.830
belief that they're loved by God.
Um,

555
00:37:39.950 --> 00:37:42.660
then we have them actually do a variety of activities,

556
00:37:43.020 --> 00:37:47.100
sometimes playing the game or singing folk songs or worshiping together.

557
00:37:47.700 --> 00:37:51.390
Um,
we take,
we monitored their oxytocin,

558
00:37:51.570 --> 00:37:56.070
which is a hormone that we know mediate social relationship.
Uh,

559
00:37:56.071 --> 00:38:00.050
and then we have them play a variety of economic transfer experiments,

560
00:38:00.051 --> 00:38:04.830
standard experiments in behavioral economics.
And,
um,
here's what we found.

561
00:38:05.910 --> 00:38:08.650
We found that generosity,
um,

562
00:38:08.730 --> 00:38:13.290
scales to a sense of divine gratitude.
And animacy.

563
00:38:14.490 --> 00:38:19.410
We found that in the activities,
uh,
it is enhanced,
uh,

564
00:38:19.440 --> 00:38:23.820
by worship in particular,
highly experiential,
uh,

565
00:38:23.821 --> 00:38:26.070
or emotional modes of worship.

566
00:38:26.340 --> 00:38:30.850
And we have worked with Pentecostal people from the Pentecostal tradition and,

567
00:38:31.020 --> 00:38:32.850
and worked in it ugly.
Um,

568
00:38:32.880 --> 00:38:37.180
we found that generosity scales before and after oxytocin,

569
00:38:37.660 --> 00:38:41.320
a plasma oxytocin levels,
although we're still analyzing that data.

570
00:38:43.300 --> 00:38:46.690
Interestingly,
um,
in most of these runs,

571
00:38:46.691 --> 00:38:48.610
there've been no ingroup outgroup difference.

572
00:38:48.760 --> 00:38:50.800
So one of the prevailing theories of,
um,

573
00:38:50.950 --> 00:38:55.950
of the social valley religion is it tremendously increases in group commitment

574
00:38:56.321 --> 00:39:00.340
at the expense of outgroup hostility.
Uh,
we haven't found that,
uh,

575
00:39:00.341 --> 00:39:04.270
and a number of recent studies actually have taken a deeper look at this ingroup

576
00:39:04.271 --> 00:39:07.150
outgroup.
It turns that that there's a big,

577
00:39:07.360 --> 00:39:11.590
large amount of research that associates religious commitment with racial

578
00:39:11.591 --> 00:39:13.840
prejudice,
but,
uh,

579
00:39:13.870 --> 00:39:18.370
and strong outgroup boundaries.
When we take a deeper look,

580
00:39:18.400 --> 00:39:22.510
if we divide up the religious commitment into what's called extrinsic and

581
00:39:22.511 --> 00:39:26.020
intrinsic religiosity,
extrinsic,
uh,

582
00:39:26.021 --> 00:39:29.500
involves kind of conformity to external rules,

583
00:39:29.890 --> 00:39:33.820
oftentimes for the conscious consciously for the sake of a personal benefit.

584
00:39:34.420 --> 00:39:39.420
Intrinsic is an internalized experience and commit commitment to religious

585
00:39:39.641 --> 00:39:44.520
principles.
Uh,
it turns out that intrinsic religiosity,
uh,

586
00:39:44.530 --> 00:39:49.530
is associated with a permeability and relaxation of group areas and intrinsic

587
00:39:51.010 --> 00:39:55.960
religiosity is associated with the rigid effication of group barriers.

588
00:39:57.100 --> 00:39:59.350
Okay.
So

589
00:40:00.990 --> 00:40:04.650
one last snapshot.
If in fact,

590
00:40:04.651 --> 00:40:09.651
we are disposed to have certain kinds of beliefs and if in fact those beliefs

591
00:40:11.070 --> 00:40:16.050
and the practices associated with them,
uh,
relate to,

592
00:40:16.390 --> 00:40:19.710
uh,
the establishment of social coherence,

593
00:40:21.330 --> 00:40:26.330
is there anything inside us that would benefit and welcome from and welcome

594
00:40:27.431 --> 00:40:32.180
those pleats?
So,
last couple of decades,

595
00:40:32.181 --> 00:40:36.650
there have been an explosion of literature on religion and health.

596
00:40:39.400 --> 00:40:41.200
This would be a talking to and of itself,

597
00:40:41.230 --> 00:40:45.760
but I want to give you a snapshot and I'll close with a suggestion for an

598
00:40:45.761 --> 00:40:48.730
interesting review if any of you are interested in it.

599
00:40:49.060 --> 00:40:51.280
But there have been over 3000 studies,

600
00:40:51.910 --> 00:40:56.050
the overwhelming majority of which have associated,
uh,

601
00:40:56.380 --> 00:41:00.160
re various measures of religious involvement,
uh,

602
00:41:00.190 --> 00:41:04.180
with cardiac and cancer and all cause mortality,

603
00:41:04.210 --> 00:41:07.480
a reduction measures of life satisfaction,

604
00:41:07.990 --> 00:41:12.820
various majors of mental health,
depression,
PTSD,
even suicide.

605
00:41:13.540 --> 00:41:18.430
And I told j h and my points would have a butt and there's a big,
but here,
uh,

606
00:41:18.650 --> 00:41:20.170
the body has many,

607
00:41:20.171 --> 00:41:25.171
if not most of these studies while the correlations are there were weekly

608
00:41:26.471 --> 00:41:31.471
designed because they were cross sectional rather than Longitudinal.

609
00:41:32.650 --> 00:41:35.690
They particular groups,
uh,

610
00:41:36.170 --> 00:41:39.530
and scale them in terms of their religiosity but they didn't follow them.

611
00:41:40.070 --> 00:41:41.780
And the problem with that is this,

612
00:41:42.890 --> 00:41:47.270
if you have a correlation between church attendance and mental health or

613
00:41:47.271 --> 00:41:48.230
physical health,

614
00:41:48.800 --> 00:41:52.130
we don't know whether church attendance and the involvement and community and

615
00:41:52.131 --> 00:41:56.840
the meaning making,
uh,
improves physical or mental health.

616
00:41:57.680 --> 00:42:02.680
Or is it just the case that people with mental or physical ailments are less

617
00:42:03.081 --> 00:42:04.490
likely to get out?

618
00:42:05.210 --> 00:42:08.870
So a lot of these studies have been flawed,

619
00:42:09.020 --> 00:42:13.580
but in the last couple of years there've been some really,
really interesting,

620
00:42:13.640 --> 00:42:17.720
well done longitudinal studies.
I'll just show you one,

621
00:42:18.370 --> 00:42:19.203
uh,

622
00:42:19.400 --> 00:42:24.400
from the American Medical Association Journal of Internal Medicine.

623
00:42:25.600 --> 00:42:27.350
Um,
this study was,

624
00:42:27.380 --> 00:42:30.800
it took 75,000 nurses and follow them over 20 years.

625
00:42:31.490 --> 00:42:34.130
They adjusted for age,
alcohol,
smoking,

626
00:42:34.370 --> 00:42:38.690
educational level of the individual and their spouse.
If they had one exercise,

627
00:42:38.691 --> 00:42:43.430
diet,
vitamins,
hypertension,
body mass index,

628
00:42:43.431 --> 00:42:45.230
depression,
family income,

629
00:42:45.950 --> 00:42:50.150
and even measures of social integration adjusted for this at the beginning of

630
00:42:50.151 --> 00:42:54.680
the study.
And then just monitored church attendance,
uh,

631
00:42:54.681 --> 00:42:58.100
on a questionnaire submitted every four years.

632
00:42:59.180 --> 00:43:03.380
And it turns out that there was in those who retain,

633
00:43:03.440 --> 00:43:06.500
attended church once or more a week,

634
00:43:06.501 --> 00:43:11.501
there's a 33% reduction in all cause mortality a over this 20 year period.

635
00:43:14.990 --> 00:43:17.930
Now,
why would this be the case?
Um,

636
00:43:18.170 --> 00:43:22.760
we can take a look at that and the question section if anybody wants to discuss

637
00:43:22.761 --> 00:43:26.830
that.
But since this study,
there have been a tremendous,
uh,

638
00:43:26.831 --> 00:43:30.250
a great number of other,
uh,

639
00:43:30.310 --> 00:43:32.240
can comment variable control,

640
00:43:32.690 --> 00:43:37.690
longterm longitudinal studies that have found similar outcomes for various

641
00:43:38.301 --> 00:43:41.360
measures of physical and psychological health.

642
00:43:42.200 --> 00:43:46.980
And I'll just mentioned that there's a really wonderful review of this work,
uh,

643
00:43:47.110 --> 00:43:51.910
a few months ago and the proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,
uh,

644
00:43:51.950 --> 00:43:54.920
one of the most prestigious scientific journals there is.

645
00:43:55.340 --> 00:43:58.070
This work was done by Tyler Vanderwiel,

646
00:43:58.071 --> 00:44:02.420
who's has joint appointments in the Department of Epidemiology and

647
00:44:02.421 --> 00:44:06.020
biostatistics,
uh,
at the Harvard School of Public Health.

648
00:44:06.890 --> 00:44:09.890
Tyler has been very critical of a lot of the previous studies,

649
00:44:10.370 --> 00:44:12.380
but in this review paper,

650
00:44:12.890 --> 00:44:16.370
he looked only at Longitudinal studies,
uh,

651
00:44:16.371 --> 00:44:19.160
that can controlled for concomitant variables.

652
00:44:19.700 --> 00:44:23.660
And the reason I'm recommending it to you is because it's not just on religion

653
00:44:23.661 --> 00:44:28.130
and health.
Uh,
it's on the promotion of human flourishing.

654
00:44:28.940 --> 00:44:32.160
So he looks at various out majors of human flourishing,

655
00:44:32.670 --> 00:44:36.450
which includes statements of emotional happiness,
of stability,

656
00:44:36.451 --> 00:44:39.240
of personal relationships,
uh,

657
00:44:39.840 --> 00:44:43.980
physical health and some sense of meaning in one's life.

658
00:44:44.460 --> 00:44:47.310
And he reviews literature in four areas,

659
00:44:48.970 --> 00:44:51.370
family structure,
education work,

660
00:44:51.400 --> 00:44:55.900
and religious involvement and finds that all of these things make substantial

661
00:44:55.901 --> 00:45:00.880
causal contributions to human flourishing.
So to close,

662
00:45:02.320 --> 00:45:05.770
none of this makes religion true.
In fact,

663
00:45:05.830 --> 00:45:09.070
it doesn't even make religion uniformly beneficial.

664
00:45:10.210 --> 00:45:15.210
There are negative God's beliefs that have demonstrably toxic effects on

665
00:45:15.311 --> 00:45:17.110
individual and social flourishing.

666
00:45:18.460 --> 00:45:23.460
But what this does represent is the questions represent fascinating areas of

667
00:45:26.790 --> 00:45:29.560
open minded,
scientific inquiry.

668
00:45:30.400 --> 00:45:35.230
Some of these people I mentioned Don Johnson and enrich SOSUS.
Um,

669
00:45:35.710 --> 00:45:39.520
I've had the privilege of collaborating with for many years.
Dom's an atheist.

670
00:45:40.210 --> 00:45:44.950
A rich is a practicing Jew,
a though I don't know whether he's a ps.

671
00:45:45.510 --> 00:45:46.570
Uh,
I'm a Christian.

672
00:45:47.320 --> 00:45:52.320
We have a fantastic fun with each other and it's a fascinating area of study in

673
00:45:53.351 --> 00:45:56.080
which I think it represents right now.

674
00:45:56.650 --> 00:46:00.750
Not Conclusions looking for evidence,
uh,
but answers,
uh,

675
00:46:00.760 --> 00:46:03.970
really looking questions,
really looking for answers.

676
00:46:04.720 --> 00:46:09.720
But in addition to being an area that's fun for openminded scientific inquiry,

677
00:46:12.580 --> 00:46:15.250
I think it's one worthy of existential inquiry as well.

678
00:46:15.850 --> 00:46:19.840
So I'll quote close with a quote from Pascal who I began with.

679
00:46:20.710 --> 00:46:24.460
The God of Christians is not a god who is simply the author of the mathematical

680
00:46:24.461 --> 00:46:26.920
truth or that ruler of the elements.

681
00:46:27.430 --> 00:46:31.570
He's not merely a god who exercises his providence over the life and fortunes of

682
00:46:31.571 --> 00:46:35.560
men.
The got a Christians is a god of love and of comfort,

683
00:46:36.130 --> 00:46:38.500
a god who fills the soul and the heart of those.

684
00:46:38.620 --> 00:46:43.620
He possesses a god who makes them conscious of their inward waywardness and his

685
00:46:44.081 --> 00:46:45.130
infinite mercy

686
00:46:46.600 --> 00:46:51.520
who unites himself to their inmost soul and who fills it with humility and joy

687
00:46:51.550 --> 00:46:53.020
with confidence and love,

688
00:46:53.650 --> 00:46:57.550
who renders them incapable of any other end than himself.

689
00:47:00.690 --> 00:47:01.590
Thank you very much.

690
00:47:07.430 --> 00:47:08.270
<v 1>Yeah,
thank you for that.</v>

691
00:47:08.271 --> 00:47:13.271
You condensed a lot into 45 minutes and luckily it does give us 15 minutes for

692
00:47:13.551 --> 00:47:17.430
questions and we can go a little bit overboard.
Uh,
so I will,
um,
you know,

693
00:47:17.510 --> 00:47:21.190
pass around the mic.
A case one has here and we do have a dory online.

694
00:47:21.200 --> 00:47:25.160
I'll actually rotate between questions on that.
And any of you live streaming,

695
00:47:25.161 --> 00:47:29.270
if you do want to ask a question our door,
is it go f a f Dory

696
00:47:30.910 --> 00:47:33.220
first.
Does anyone have opening question from the room?

697
00:47:34.090 --> 00:47:37.500
Have not actually had a question myself.
Um,
so I'm a,

698
00:47:37.510 --> 00:47:39.910
I remember getting reference of s,
uh,

699
00:47:39.940 --> 00:47:43.240
kind of a study that kind of went along against the idea of faith and

700
00:47:43.241 --> 00:47:44.590
flourishing.
Uh,

701
00:47:44.630 --> 00:47:49.630
was I believe a did mark study that was talking about how people that were there

702
00:47:50.111 --> 00:47:53.170
and I guess it goes back to the flourishing part or being more happy and all

703
00:47:53.171 --> 00:47:53.411
that.

704
00:47:53.411 --> 00:47:58.110
And I like how people outside of the realms of religion and of that are lead it

705
00:47:58.111 --> 00:48:02.040
out.
So do you have any,
yeah,
that's,
I'm glad you're asking it.

706
00:48:02.080 --> 00:48:04.820
And I told you from the start,
I'm,

707
00:48:06.220 --> 00:48:09.940
<v 2>these are complicated issues.
I'm nervous about oversimplifying.
Um,</v>

708
00:48:11.230 --> 00:48:12.940
but let's take a look at that.

709
00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:25.710
Okay.
So here,
this is,
this is,
uh,
an international survey.

710
00:48:25.740 --> 00:48:29.940
The percentage saying that religion is important in their daily life versus

711
00:48:29.941 --> 00:48:34.750
what's the quality of your life today.
One is from Matt.

712
00:48:34.751 --> 00:48:39.751
It shouldn't be one that you'd be 10 very bath one is the worst possible and

713
00:48:40.260 --> 00:48:45.170
Denmark is at the top and it's one of the least religious,
uh,

714
00:48:45.300 --> 00:48:46.950
cultures on the planet.

715
00:48:47.940 --> 00:48:52.200
Togo is way down at the bottom and it's highly religious.
By the way,

716
00:48:52.201 --> 00:48:56.670
this isn't just true internationally.
So if we look at,
um,

717
00:48:57.110 --> 00:49:02.110
emotional wellbeing is a Gallup poll with no particular ax to grind and

718
00:49:04.561 --> 00:49:08.190
religious attention,
attendance by state,
um,

719
00:49:08.430 --> 00:49:09.600
there's a negative relationship

720
00:49:11.580 --> 00:49:15.990
and it's also true with life expectancy,
uh,

721
00:49:16.410 --> 00:49:20.940
a negative relationship.
So here's my comment.

722
00:49:22.110 --> 00:49:22.943
First of all,

723
00:49:23.880 --> 00:49:28.320
these studies actually suffer from the same weakness that I said other

724
00:49:28.321 --> 00:49:30.690
correlational studies suffer from.

725
00:49:31.320 --> 00:49:34.050
They're not controlling for concomitant variables.

726
00:49:34.650 --> 00:49:39.150
So it may in fact be the case that,
um,

727
00:49:39.760 --> 00:49:42.780
from,
for various reasons,
uh,

728
00:49:42.870 --> 00:49:47.870
as the default standard of living as a society rises,

729
00:49:49.320 --> 00:49:54.120
the religiosity goes down.
Um,
but so does health or happened,

730
00:49:54.121 --> 00:49:57.840
but health and happiness goes up,
we'd call that concomitant variability.

731
00:49:58.580 --> 00:50:03.580
The other possible problem with these studies is that they represent what's been

732
00:50:03.901 --> 00:50:05.550
called the ecological fallacy.

733
00:50:06.210 --> 00:50:10.500
Ecological fallacies is sampling at the wrong scale.

734
00:50:11.310 --> 00:50:12.780
So,
and by the way,

735
00:50:12.781 --> 00:50:17.310
my own initial training within ecology actually in the size of the sampling
unit,

736
00:50:17.311 --> 00:50:20.560
it made all the difference in what we'd find in terms of correlation within

737
00:50:21.540 --> 00:50:24.810
environmental variable.
So,
and I want to thank,
um,

738
00:50:25.170 --> 00:50:28.130
the social psychiatry at colleges,
David Myers for this,

739
00:50:28.820 --> 00:50:30.140
if we look at a different scale,

740
00:50:31.340 --> 00:50:36.340
if we look at the individual scale here in the u s we get the exact opposite.

741
00:50:37.540 --> 00:50:42.170
Uh,
we have increasing happiness with number,

742
00:50:42.200 --> 00:50:46.940
just church attendance,
and we get the same relationship,
uh,

743
00:50:46.941 --> 00:50:50.780
with life expectancy if we look at the individual scale.

744
00:50:50.781 --> 00:50:54.860
So with respect to those studies,
I don't want to dismiss them too cavalierly,

745
00:50:55.580 --> 00:50:58.130
uh,
but they're not longitudinal.
Um,

746
00:50:58.400 --> 00:51:01.760
and they don't control for concomitant variables.
Uh,

747
00:51:01.900 --> 00:51:04.760
and they may suffer from the ecological fallacy.

748
00:51:08.030 --> 00:51:11.000
<v 1>When I do have a question that came in at the Doreen and,
uh,</v>

749
00:51:11.020 --> 00:51:13.610
this is from grace from Sydney,
Australia,
she said,

750
00:51:13.611 --> 00:51:16.550
it's awesome to hear how the ways that science and faith intersect,

751
00:51:16.940 --> 00:51:20.930
but I also wanted to hear how people argue that humans just think they need

752
00:51:20.931 --> 00:51:23.280
religion.
We can know whether,

753
00:51:23.360 --> 00:51:27.110
how can we know that we are wired for the evidence of God's intelligent design

754
00:51:27.350 --> 00:51:29.630
or his religion or a result of how we are wired?

755
00:51:32.700 --> 00:51:33.533
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

756
00:51:34.070 --> 00:51:37.400
<v 2>Well,
that's the big question.
So,
uh,
we,</v>

757
00:51:37.550 --> 00:51:40.850
we might sub divided into two questions.

758
00:51:40.880 --> 00:51:44.930
The first one's an empirical question.
Does it look like humans?

759
00:51:45.710 --> 00:51:50.480
By the way?
I wouldn't say wired because wired suggested it's in our hardware.

760
00:51:51.050 --> 00:51:53.500
Um,
and that,
um,

761
00:51:53.550 --> 00:51:58.550
and somehow it's absolutely a Nate and that no matter what context we grew up

762
00:51:59.211 --> 00:52:03.530
in,
uh,
we have these dispositions.
I don't think that's the case.

763
00:52:03.590 --> 00:52:07.730
I'm biologist described peanut types as gene by environment interactions.

764
00:52:08.390 --> 00:52:13.390
So one is the empirical question of are we disposed to believe certain things,

765
00:52:14.250 --> 00:52:14.570
uh,

766
00:52:14.570 --> 00:52:19.490
growing up in environments that are typical human family and cultural

767
00:52:19.491 --> 00:52:24.070
environments that are typical of the natural history of our species.
Uh,

768
00:52:24.080 --> 00:52:27.110
and I would say we are,
we are disposed to do those things.

769
00:52:27.610 --> 00:52:31.450
And then the next question,
uh,
okay.
As,
as we,
um,

770
00:52:32.330 --> 00:52:36.050
as we construct them in imbibe,
those kinds of beliefs are,

771
00:52:36.051 --> 00:52:38.120
we not only dispose to hold them,

772
00:52:38.540 --> 00:52:43.310
but did they make a positive difference in our life?
I'd say here,
um,

773
00:52:43.370 --> 00:52:44.600
the data are complicated,

774
00:52:44.601 --> 00:52:48.410
depends on the nature of the beliefs and the way we embrace them.
Uh,

775
00:52:48.590 --> 00:52:51.140
but today the same,
pretty robust,
uh,

776
00:52:51.141 --> 00:52:55.910
that certain kinds of beliefs and behaviors held in certain ways are contributed

777
00:52:56.030 --> 00:53:00.260
to flourishing at both individual and social levels.
Now,
uh,

778
00:53:00.500 --> 00:53:04.990
our friend in Australia question is,
okay,
so,
uh,

779
00:53:05.030 --> 00:53:09.110
do we have the beliefs cause we're wired,
uh,
to generate them.

780
00:53:09.630 --> 00:53:10.463
Um,

781
00:53:10.490 --> 00:53:15.490
or do we have them because there is a creator who wired us to have them.

782
00:53:18.230 --> 00:53:22.400
Well that's not a question that's empirically answerable has it.
Um,

783
00:53:22.550 --> 00:53:24.800
what we can say is,
um,

784
00:53:24.980 --> 00:53:29.980
contrary to it in a number of the folks I cited here is it doesn't look like

785
00:53:30.781 --> 00:53:35.370
from the empirical data.
There's anything that would subvert that belief.

786
00:53:36.300 --> 00:53:38.160
But the design argument itself,

787
00:53:38.250 --> 00:53:42.960
whether it's fine tuning of the cosmos or whether it's fine tuning of the human

788
00:53:42.990 --> 00:53:46.920
cognitive architecture,
I'm going to go back to Pascal on this.

789
00:53:47.410 --> 00:53:52.410
There was enough light to see that there's something there we're seeing and not

790
00:53:52.561 --> 00:53:54.120
enough light to see it clearly.

791
00:53:54.180 --> 00:53:59.180
And Pascal says that that's actually a good thing because if we came to belief

792
00:54:01.021 --> 00:54:04.440
in God by purely rational inference a,

793
00:54:04.470 --> 00:54:08.970
we'd believe in God as a proposition.
And he says,

794
00:54:08.971 --> 00:54:10.080
if we have this hunch,

795
00:54:10.110 --> 00:54:14.610
this question that there might be a god and we come to God and ask him,

796
00:54:14.670 --> 00:54:18.310
are you there and have an interaction with him,
uh,

797
00:54:18.390 --> 00:54:20.940
then we have a god who's the relational loving being.

798
00:54:23.460 --> 00:54:24.890
<v 4>Thanks.
Thanks for the talk.
Um,</v>

799
00:54:25.450 --> 00:54:28.220
so I have a question regarding these studies and a little bit,

800
00:54:28.221 --> 00:54:32.180
I think you've kind of alluded to it.
Um,
just the confounding factors of it.

801
00:54:32.181 --> 00:54:34.040
So you mentioned that yes,

802
00:54:34.041 --> 00:54:38.420
their career section on some longitudinal right with 20 years is a long time and

803
00:54:38.421 --> 00:54:42.140
uh,
you know,
you normalizing the beginning,
but if you keep going to church,

804
00:54:42.141 --> 00:54:46.370
perhaps you'll find a group of people that you enjoy being with and the husband

805
00:54:46.400 --> 00:54:51.400
and we know those factors actually are affecting your level of happiness.

806
00:54:51.531 --> 00:54:55.430
So how do you,
how can you explain that?
Not so much genetics,

807
00:54:55.431 --> 00:54:59.570
but like also like the effect of the environment and how that interacts with

808
00:54:59.571 --> 00:55:00.404
religion.

809
00:55:00.730 --> 00:55:05.270
<v 2>So,
um,
this was a 20 year study.
I mean,
I,</v>

810
00:55:05.560 --> 00:55:08.020
I,
I'm a little overwhelmed at the,

811
00:55:08.021 --> 00:55:12.610
at the scale this study cause the 75,000 people over 20 years and they actually

812
00:55:12.611 --> 00:55:17.530
went back every four years and checked with them and adjusted for covariates.

813
00:55:18.160 --> 00:55:18.491
Uh,

814
00:55:18.491 --> 00:55:23.491
so that graph I showed you at the end was a graph at not of the actual mortality

815
00:55:24.461 --> 00:55:25.294
data,

816
00:55:25.450 --> 00:55:29.860
but a model of the mortality data once these other,
uh,

817
00:55:29.920 --> 00:55:33.710
covariates had been adjusted for.
So it's,
um,

818
00:55:33.760 --> 00:55:38.230
we need more studies like that.
But now that the next question would be,
well,
why,

819
00:55:39.160 --> 00:55:43.060
what's going on here?
And it's,

820
00:55:45.440 --> 00:55:50.440
they did what's called mediating analysis and it looks like that even after

821
00:55:51.351 --> 00:55:54.350
controlling for covariance,

822
00:55:56.940 --> 00:55:59.650
uh,
it looks like social inclusion,
um,

823
00:56:00.650 --> 00:56:05.450
was an important factor and optimism and hope,

824
00:56:05.540 --> 00:56:05.751
uh,

825
00:56:05.751 --> 00:56:10.340
was an important factor and that different between the two groups longitudinally

826
00:56:10.880 --> 00:56:14.480
study.
Now,
one question we might ask is,
okay,

827
00:56:14.481 --> 00:56:18.800
well if we had something other than religion that would contribute to folks

828
00:56:19.340 --> 00:56:23.210
sense of social inclusion,
uh,
in buoyancy or optimism,

829
00:56:24.160 --> 00:56:27.820
could that perform a similar function?
And maybe so maybe,

830
00:56:27.850 --> 00:56:29.710
maybe they should look in Denmark,

831
00:56:31.100 --> 00:56:34.550
maybe like a place like Denmark where people are,
I mean,
I'm just,

832
00:56:34.580 --> 00:56:36.170
I'm not saying just being a little bit,

833
00:56:36.171 --> 00:56:40.250
but then mark would be a place where people maybe have that hope because

834
00:56:40.280 --> 00:56:44.390
socially the situation is not as dire.
So if you go to Togo,

835
00:56:44.450 --> 00:56:47.270
like there's not much there.
Yeah.
Well,
I mean there's stuff,

836
00:56:47.271 --> 00:56:50.300
but you know what I mean?
Yeah,
for sure.
Yup.

837
00:56:50.540 --> 00:56:55.520
Sometimes is the feeling of belonging to a group can mediate that effect too.

838
00:56:55.670 --> 00:56:58.280
Yeah.
So,
um,
yeah,

839
00:56:58.670 --> 00:57:02.600
we do need more international studies of the things.
Uh,

840
00:57:02.690 --> 00:57:04.330
here in the u s uh,

841
00:57:04.370 --> 00:57:08.930
there have been a number of studies that have targeted different cultural groups

842
00:57:09.640 --> 00:57:12.890
as well.
So a number of studies have looked at just the effects.

843
00:57:12.980 --> 00:57:17.240
One study looked at just effects a religious involvement on coronary heart

844
00:57:17.241 --> 00:57:20.150
disease in African Americans,
for example.

845
00:57:20.151 --> 00:57:24.050
So different social group with the different,
different social challenges.

846
00:57:25.250 --> 00:57:26.083
<v 3>Okay.</v>

847
00:57:27.710 --> 00:57:31.570
<v 1>We did have one more question in the door and uh,
and it was actually about,
um,</v>

848
00:57:31.600 --> 00:57:33.790
just like definitions of flourishing is,

849
00:57:33.791 --> 00:57:35.750
I think this was in reference back to your slide.

850
00:57:35.751 --> 00:57:37.790
I'm talking about the oxytocin and measuring yet.

851
00:57:37.791 --> 00:57:41.210
So I think what they were trying to ask is,
uh,

852
00:57:41.211 --> 00:57:44.120
what is your definition of flourishing personally?

853
00:57:44.300 --> 00:57:48.980
And is there a definition that science can give us of what is exactly who my

854
00:57:48.981 --> 00:57:51.620
people are seeing and where would be the intersection of the two?

855
00:57:52.970 --> 00:57:54.770
<v 2>Well,
I'll start with the first one.
I,</v>

856
00:57:54.771 --> 00:57:59.660
I'd be really nervous if we relied on science that tells us what human

857
00:57:59.661 --> 00:58:04.580
flourishing is.
The sciences do two things,
not there.
Uh,

858
00:58:04.610 --> 00:58:09.610
they attempt to rigorously describe regularities and the natural world and then

859
00:58:10.821 --> 00:58:14.690
they attempt to generate causal explanations for those regularities.

860
00:58:15.380 --> 00:58:18.590
Um,
so,
you know,
risk at Tealium terms,

861
00:58:19.250 --> 00:58:21.770
science proposed as efficient causes of things.

862
00:58:22.880 --> 00:58:26.810
Aristotle also talked about final causes.
He talked about,
uh,

863
00:58:26.960 --> 00:58:31.610
the ends for which things are constructed and his notion of nature,

864
00:58:31.611 --> 00:58:32.800
for example,
of,

865
00:58:32.960 --> 00:58:37.490
of human nature or the nature of anything was highly teleological,
uh,

866
00:58:37.491 --> 00:58:41.780
that we had a particular end.
And,
and his view.
Um,

867
00:58:42.050 --> 00:58:46.730
and in the view probably of most of us here,
if there's isn't end,

868
00:58:46.850 --> 00:58:51.770
uh,
let's see if there is a normative t lows and we miss it.

869
00:58:52.130 --> 00:58:53.000
Well that's called,

870
00:58:53.450 --> 00:58:58.190
that's called tragedy or in in physical context is called illness.

871
00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:02.390
Um,
but science camp decide what that end is,

872
00:59:03.290 --> 00:59:07.670
nor Contra Dawkins candidate decide whether there is such an hand.

873
00:59:08.570 --> 00:59:13.360
So my definition of flourishing,
uh,

874
00:59:13.820 --> 00:59:17.480
in my own life,
um,
well even before I was a Christian,

875
00:59:17.481 --> 00:59:20.480
I thought that ultimately flourishing

876
00:59:22.040 --> 00:59:27.040
was to have a matrix of intimate and loving relationships with other folks with

877
00:59:27.801 --> 00:59:30.130
whom I could be myself.
Uh,

878
00:59:30.230 --> 00:59:33.560
they could be their selves to me and for home,

879
00:59:33.561 --> 00:59:37.520
we would be invested in one another.
But,

880
00:59:38.210 --> 00:59:39.043
uh,

881
00:59:39.060 --> 00:59:44.060
in speaking autobiographically that Anna and I am so grateful I've had that in

882
00:59:44.481 --> 00:59:44.890
my life,

883
00:59:44.890 --> 00:59:49.890
but that wasn't enough and I actually construe ultimate flourishing and the

884
00:59:50.691 --> 00:59:53.960
Augustinian terms you have made us for yourself.

885
00:59:54.770 --> 00:59:59.420
And the heart is restless until it finds its recipe,
knew that flourishing,

886
01:00:00.020 --> 01:00:02.240
uh,
if loving embrace of,

887
01:00:02.270 --> 01:00:07.270
and by our creator who made us specifically for that end.

888
01:00:11.050 --> 01:00:14.610
Wow.
Thank you for that.
Great to be with you.
Enjoy,
man.
A round of applause.

889
01:00:14.780 --> 01:00:19.230
