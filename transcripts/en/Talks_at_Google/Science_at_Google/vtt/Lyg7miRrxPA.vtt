1
00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:07.180
So hello everyone.

2
00:00:07.181 --> 00:00:11.500
I'd like to begin by thanking Omar for the lovely introduction and Caroline for

3
00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:13.750
um,
amazing organizing coming up to this.

4
00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:19.450
One of the things Caroline said to me in passing was that there was 69 languages

5
00:00:19.811 --> 00:00:23.500
spoken here in the Google offices and that the average age was 24.

6
00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:28.930
And my initial reaction to that was to feel incredibly old.
Uh,

7
00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:32.080
my secondary auction is what would such a forward looking group,

8
00:00:32.081 --> 00:00:36.160
whether 24 or older,
you know,
would they be interested in the past,

9
00:00:36.161 --> 00:00:39.640
would they be interested in new grange?
So I set myself a task.

10
00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:44.620
What I'm going to try and do in this talk is to speak about a new grange as an

11
00:00:44.621 --> 00:00:47.740
avenue to discussing our shared past,

12
00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:53.060
but also as I have come to believe how new range and the period in which it has

13
00:00:53.061 --> 00:00:57.190
built has things to say to us about today and about the future also.

14
00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:02.680
So to do that,
what I'd first like to do is go back a little bit to my own past.

15
00:01:02.681 --> 00:01:06.670
And really what I'd like to identify is how my interest in the past,

16
00:01:06.671 --> 00:01:08.980
which was for a long time,
just a general interest,

17
00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:11.780
how it turned into something a little bit deeper,
uh,

18
00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:15.100
and something that could speak a little bit more to the future.

19
00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:21.330
So this is my grand old girl's house and I grew up very near here.

20
00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.530
Um,
and my grandparents would have been a big influence on me.
Um,

21
00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:30.490
this is my grandmother on the left.
Uh,
Florence King.

22
00:01:30.491 --> 00:01:33.640
She would have been born in 1908 on her mother beside her,

23
00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:36.250
Bridget at born in 1882.

24
00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:39.520
So there was a lot of old things around this house.

25
00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:43.210
It was really kind of an island,
uh,
of the past.

26
00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:48.190
So the 1970s and the,
see we're busy modernizing farms all over Ireland,

27
00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:53.320
but somehow this farm seem to avoid all of that.
And it was really a haven of,

28
00:01:53.321 --> 00:01:57.700
of sort of ancient artifacts and plowing was still done with a horse,

29
00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:02.440
believe it or notch hay bales brought in on an old style bogey card.

30
00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.481
Um,

31
00:02:03.481 --> 00:02:06.520
and if you were to walk through that door there and the house doesn't exist any

32
00:02:06.521 --> 00:02:10.840
longer,
but when it did,
if you were to walk through that door,
take a left,

33
00:02:10.841 --> 00:02:12.910
you'd be in the main room and turning to the right,

34
00:02:12.911 --> 00:02:17.911
you see a very big open fireplace across that fireplace with large metal beams.

35
00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:23.770
And Potts would have been sat on that.
And if you looked above that again,

36
00:02:23.771 --> 00:02:24.850
you'd see a mental piece.

37
00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:28.030
And it was a metal box containing hundreds and hundreds of beautiful little

38
00:02:28.031 --> 00:02:29.110
colored cards.

39
00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:34.660
So these were sold by cigarette companies and they were kind of a promotional

40
00:02:34.661 --> 00:02:38.290
thing.
Um,
so the idea is there would be sets on everything.

41
00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:43.000
So there could be a set and wild flowers,
um,
you know,
garden tips.

42
00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.040
Um,
if it was today,

43
00:02:45.041 --> 00:02:49.120
there would be sets on being a Gmail Ninja or whatever it is.

44
00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:54.040
Um,
one's on,
um,
magical,
uh,

45
00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:56.020
artifacts are amulets.

46
00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:00.760
So you can see here at the scarab beetle on the left or charms.
So we have this,

47
00:03:00.761 --> 00:03:04.630
a prehistoric neolithic stone tool,
which can be mounted in metal.

48
00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:09.730
But this I think was the first time I was introduced to a prehistoric monument.

49
00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:11.710
And as you can see on the left and right here,

50
00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:14.890
there are these ancient pyramids in Egypt.

51
00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:17.830
And of course each of the cards would have a little bit of information,
uh,

52
00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:18.551
on the back.

53
00:03:18.551 --> 00:03:23.500
So here you can see the pyramids are being touted as the oldest buildings in the

54
00:03:23.501 --> 00:03:24.334
world.

55
00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:30.890
No anybody with even a passing interest in megalithic monuments and new grange.

56
00:03:31.721 --> 00:03:36.070
And so on these days we'll hear the oft repeated statement older than the

57
00:03:36.071 --> 00:03:39.490
pyramids.
So we hear this all the time.
And in fact,

58
00:03:39.491 --> 00:03:43.920
many of our megalithic monuments,
we now know to be about a thousand years,
uh,

59
00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:48.400
before,
uh,
the great pyramid in Giza was built,
for instance.

60
00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:53.230
So it goes to show that a cigarette smoking isn't the best way to receive an

61
00:03:53.231 --> 00:03:55.510
education.
Uh,
perhaps.

62
00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:01.120
So another way that I became interested in the past was through the landscape

63
00:04:01.121 --> 00:04:03.100
itself.
So this is a critical,

64
00:04:03.101 --> 00:04:05.860
Derek leaves or someone else from County Kildare in the audience here.

65
00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:07.810
And walking down to the river,

66
00:04:07.811 --> 00:04:12.070
Lithia would naturally Passover ploughed fields and you'd end up looking down

67
00:04:12.071 --> 00:04:15.580
and you'd see these objects that would appear in the fields at the time.

68
00:04:15.581 --> 00:04:19.420
Of course,
I knew archaeological training.
Um,
and you know,

69
00:04:19.421 --> 00:04:21.730
I wouldn't have known anything about time periods.

70
00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:26.740
So walking home they may have had a piece of early 20th century ceramic and my

71
00:04:26.741 --> 00:04:31.600
pocket sitting beside a prehistoric stone tool completely on recognized.

72
00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:36.430
Um,
I should say for any view,
game of Thrones fans out there,

73
00:04:36.431 --> 00:04:41.170
any resemblance to bran is purely accidental.

74
00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:44.380
So in this way,
um,

75
00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:49.240
my little childhood hobby sort of mimicked the infancy of archeology and this

76
00:04:49.241 --> 00:04:52.540
was from the 17th century and increasing the up to the 19th century,

77
00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:56.140
antiquarian just collected lots and lots of objects from all over the world.

78
00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:59.200
If you wanted to get an education,
you might go on a grand tour,

79
00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:03.100
you'd go to interesting places,
classical sites,
and bring things back from there.

80
00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:06.040
So you'd find these collections,
everything and anything,
you know,

81
00:05:06.041 --> 00:05:10.390
interesting things from the natural world,
coins,
fossils,
you name it,

82
00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:14.650
sometimes antiquities from the past too.
But they would sit beside each other.

83
00:05:14.651 --> 00:05:18.850
Their age is not known.
Their age is relative to each other,
not known.
And those,

84
00:05:18.851 --> 00:05:23.290
the great antiquity of humankind kind of lay on recognized.

85
00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:29.260
I can't say I learned very much from field walking.
Um,

86
00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:33.130
I did realize it was better to walk a till field and better after rain because

87
00:05:33.131 --> 00:05:35.470
the objects would show up that little bit more clearly.

88
00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:40.930
And I do remember a kind of trance like focus,
uh,
walking across the fields.

89
00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:47.260
One thing that I realized was that the past is all around us,

90
00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:52.600
so especially under our fish.
So even in this building here,

91
00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:54.880
down the road,
um,

92
00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:59.170
was vikings walked here woodkey and say,
yeah,

93
00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:04.180
at the moment there's excavations on James Street on a 12th century church site.

94
00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:07.950
So the past is really all around us.
Uh,

95
00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:10.310
for me it didn't feel like an abstract thing.

96
00:06:10.311 --> 00:06:14.180
It felt almost like part of a continuous and kind of layered present.

97
00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:19.250
But for all that,
you know,
being said,
uh,
you know,

98
00:06:19.251 --> 00:06:21.890
my interest in the past was still a little bit vague,

99
00:06:21.891 --> 00:06:25.010
really probably not that different than,
than most people.

100
00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:28.400
It was kind of a curiosity,
maybe a little bit nostalgic,

101
00:06:28.401 --> 00:06:31.070
something to do with memory,
but that was really it.

102
00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:36.080
But all that changed on the first time I visited new grange here and for those

103
00:06:36.081 --> 00:06:39.140
who,
how many people here have been to new grange or seen a picture of your good?

104
00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:41.930
Lots of people.
That's terrific.
Um,

105
00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:47.420
so I wasn't a child when I visited the sub is about 21 and on a trip out from

106
00:06:47.421 --> 00:06:52.220
college,
and this was just kind of a day out.
And um,
as you can see,

107
00:06:52.221 --> 00:06:55.790
the site has really enormous,
so it's at its widest point,

108
00:06:55.791 --> 00:07:00.470
about 87 meters across.
It's on about half a hectare of land.

109
00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:03.830
So it's an enormous thing.
And as for many people,

110
00:07:03.831 --> 00:07:06.380
probably most of the tourists that go there today,

111
00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:10.820
my overriding thought was how did they do this?
You know,

112
00:07:10.821 --> 00:07:15.260
something on this scale and this sophistication,
you know,

113
00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:17.360
I had grown up on in,
in this,

114
00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:21.440
on the same island and I couldn't imagine my family building something like this

115
00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:26.420
or my local community or the local farmers around about,
um,

116
00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:30.920
or even the town nearby me and quite a large town without modern equipment.

117
00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:34.730
I really don't think they could have won,
you know,
build something like this.

118
00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:39.350
So who,
where are these people?
Where did they come from?
Where they're from here,

119
00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:43.010
or if I'm somewhere else where it was that these were kind of the overriding

120
00:07:43.011 --> 00:07:44.690
questions that I had at that time.

121
00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:48.250
So most of you that have been to new range,

122
00:07:48.251 --> 00:07:52.480
we'll know that it's famous for its winter solstice orientations on the shortest

123
00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:55.560
day of the year,
the sunlight comes down into the money,
but,
but,

124
00:07:55.570 --> 00:07:59.740
but not through the entrance area here as you'd expect through this specially

125
00:07:59.741 --> 00:08:03.430
designed structure above the entrance called a roof box.

126
00:08:04.030 --> 00:08:06.130
And you'll see it a little bit better in this graphic here.

127
00:08:06.131 --> 00:08:09.730
So you can see the sunlight coming from the southeast and shooting down directly

128
00:08:09.731 --> 00:08:10.570
into the chamber.

129
00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:14.290
And even people who go there today and are aware that the sunlight comes through

130
00:08:14.291 --> 00:08:14.451
those,

131
00:08:14.451 --> 00:08:17.800
you still kind of expect it to come through the entrance and kind of slowly

132
00:08:17.801 --> 00:08:19.450
creep up on you inside the chamber.

133
00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:22.740
And they often get a surprise when the guide announces it's there.
You know,
it's,

134
00:08:22.910 --> 00:08:26.530
it's at your feet and it just appears like a laser.
So it's a very,
very striking.

135
00:08:28.410 --> 00:08:28.990
<v 2>Okay.</v>

136
00:08:28.990 --> 00:08:33.640
<v 1>So my interest in the past started to change.
After that,
I realized that</v>

137
00:08:35.230 --> 00:08:38.130
what was happening here was something and little bit more vital.

138
00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:42.700
It wasn't just something to do with nostalgia or memory.
It was as if,

139
00:08:42.701 --> 00:08:46.300
for me,
that a part of our story had been lost.

140
00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:51.160
And I sometimes think of archeology in terms of,
you know,

141
00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:54.660
the popular theme in TV and,
uh,

142
00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:56.280
literature and so on.

143
00:08:56.281 --> 00:09:00.390
You sit in a lot of Hitchcock shorts where somebody gets bumped to the head and

144
00:09:00.391 --> 00:09:03.390
completely loses their memory and they sort of wonder around a little bit,

145
00:09:03.391 --> 00:09:07.710
lost for a while.
And then sometimes it's a place or maybe an object.

146
00:09:07.711 --> 00:09:10.950
It mightn't be a particularly big object or a particularly significant object

147
00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:15.810
and all their memories come flooding back in an archeology is a little bit like

148
00:09:15.811 --> 00:09:18.060
that.
It has something of a similar role.

149
00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:23.430
Objects are reminders of who we are,
where we came from,

150
00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:26.040
they help us regain part of our story.

151
00:09:26.850 --> 00:09:29.940
These are some of the typical objects that you'll get in passage.

152
00:09:29.941 --> 00:09:31.800
Tombs like new ranch all around Ireland.

153
00:09:32.130 --> 00:09:34.890
These are from the hill of Tara from a small monument called the mount of the

154
00:09:34.891 --> 00:09:39.560
hostages.
And you've got this unusual pottery called [inaudible] where these uh,

155
00:09:39.810 --> 00:09:44.610
often polished and,
and uh,
why eater,
a beautiful colored,
stolen,
stolen bowls,

156
00:09:44.910 --> 00:09:49.320
pins and personal items often very,
very often burned on the cremation pyre.

157
00:09:51.870 --> 00:09:54.360
So monuments as well as objects they have,

158
00:09:54.540 --> 00:09:56.070
they're all around us in the landscape.

159
00:09:56.071 --> 00:09:57.810
And when you get a little bit tuned into them,

160
00:09:57.811 --> 00:09:59.880
they sort of puncture your reality.

161
00:10:00.510 --> 00:10:05.510
They invite you to pay attention in a different way.

162
00:10:07.110 --> 00:10:12.030
Um,
you realize,
oh,
people have been here before.
Maybe they led similar lives,

163
00:10:12.090 --> 00:10:13.590
had similar experiences,

164
00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:18.190
and maybe our version of reality is a little bit tinner,
uh,

165
00:10:18.210 --> 00:10:21.120
than we imagined.
This is,

166
00:10:21.121 --> 00:10:23.310
believe it or not is a passage tomb also,

167
00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:25.880
but it's one that's quite a bit older than you grains.

168
00:10:25.881 --> 00:10:29.640
So here you can see these large boulder circles,
uh,

169
00:10:29.670 --> 00:10:32.400
or stones in this boulder circle around the monument here.

170
00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:35.130
The central feature of the little chamber has been destroyed.

171
00:10:35.131 --> 00:10:37.840
You can see one stone of it here,
and this is a,
uh,

172
00:10:37.850 --> 00:10:42.540
a crucifix that was erected a good bit later in 1954 to celebrate the Marian

173
00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:47.460
year.
And the clever designers of this housing estate in the 1940s didn't want to

174
00:10:47.461 --> 00:10:50.100
interfere with the monument.
It would be taught to be superstitious,

175
00:10:50.130 --> 00:10:51.360
potentially dangerous.

176
00:10:51.630 --> 00:10:55.380
So they decided to include it in the housing estate.

177
00:10:56.070 --> 00:11:00.510
So sometimes this is playfully referred to as Ireland's first round about,

178
00:11:01.510 --> 00:11:04.410
uh,
first off of many you could say.

179
00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:06.980
<v 2>Okay.</v>

180
00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:09.410
<v 1>So on that first day in new grange,</v>

181
00:11:11.710 --> 00:11:15.640
it dawned on me that these were people with a very big vision,
uh,

182
00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:20.350
and they were people probably like you guys,
was an enormous amount of passion,

183
00:11:20.950 --> 00:11:25.030
almost impossible to conceive that would motivate them to construct something

184
00:11:25.031 --> 00:11:28.960
like this.
Um,
and it's sort of set me on a quest.

185
00:11:28.961 --> 00:11:31.090
Who were these people?
Where did they come from,

186
00:11:31.091 --> 00:11:32.770
what could we find out about them?

187
00:11:33.610 --> 00:11:35.710
And that's where we're going to go for the next part of the talk.

188
00:11:36.580 --> 00:11:39.610
So for the next few slides are going to be quite fast and we're going to get

189
00:11:39.611 --> 00:11:42.760
into a little bit of detail on passage tombs.
Um,

190
00:11:43.150 --> 00:11:46.210
so anybody who's had a particularly hard day in the office,

191
00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:50.760
this might be a good time to switch off for a couple of minutes.
Um,

192
00:11:50.860 --> 00:11:55.330
or if you like a pretty pictures,
there's some beautiful photography here,

193
00:11:55.331 --> 00:11:57.220
particularly by a guy called Ken Williams.

194
00:11:57.221 --> 00:11:59.620
And I'll point out some of his photographs.
We go along.

195
00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:03.940
So this is passage tombs over most of our island,

196
00:12:03.941 --> 00:12:07.850
but largely on this line for instead of south Wicklow over to this Slagle Mayo

197
00:12:07.851 --> 00:12:11.450
area and north of that line,
as you can say,
uh,

198
00:12:11.460 --> 00:12:13.060
they often appear singly,

199
00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:16.960
but a peculiar feature is that they appear in little groups,
little clusters,

200
00:12:17.290 --> 00:12:19.690
and we call these passage tomb complexes.

201
00:12:21.010 --> 00:12:25.690
So this is probably the most famous one.
A Bruin.
The bone yet contains new range.

202
00:12:25.930 --> 00:12:28.610
Now doubt about 40 passage tombs,

203
00:12:28.630 --> 00:12:31.900
probably originally lock crew,

204
00:12:32.140 --> 00:12:36.550
less well known about 15 passage tombs there,
maybe 30 originally.

205
00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:40.850
And Cara Keel.
Um,
I'm gonna mention curricula lots,

206
00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:44.110
so just keep a note of where it is there in Sligo.
Um,

207
00:12:44.150 --> 00:12:48.520
a whole series of monuments,
they're 26 or 27 probable passage tombs.

208
00:12:48.910 --> 00:12:50.980
There's no visitor center up there.

209
00:12:50.981 --> 00:12:54.780
There's no guides up there as an amazing place.
You can say it in a passage too,

210
00:12:54.781 --> 00:12:57.790
but not meet anyone for several hours by yourself.

211
00:12:57.791 --> 00:13:01.510
Talk to the gods or whatever it is you'd like to do in your spare time.

212
00:13:02.020 --> 00:13:03.100
And then Kara Moore,

213
00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:06.400
the most westerly of the big passage tomb complex is fairly simple,

214
00:13:06.401 --> 00:13:09.310
small and monuments in a very beautiful location.

215
00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:14.410
And so here are some of the features.

216
00:13:14.411 --> 00:13:18.070
Typically they have a passage and you can see the person who drew this kindly

217
00:13:18.071 --> 00:13:20.170
took the top off so we can see enter the monument.

218
00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:22.870
You often cross these little sill stones.

219
00:13:23.110 --> 00:13:27.640
And then when you get into the chamber there are little side recesses eh,
of,
of,

220
00:13:27.820 --> 00:13:30.340
of,
of the main chamber as you can see there.

221
00:13:31.750 --> 00:13:34.150
And some of these chambers can be quite dramatic.

222
00:13:34.151 --> 00:13:36.820
This is one of these images by Ken Williams.
Uh,

223
00:13:36.910 --> 00:13:40.840
the public can't enter this monuments.
We were very lucky even to see this image.

224
00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:46.030
Um,
and as you can see,
it's a really,
really dramatic location.
Um,

225
00:13:46.750 --> 00:13:49.450
striking art down the end of the monument.
More art here.

226
00:13:49.451 --> 00:13:51.580
And in this case they don't have side recesses.

227
00:13:51.581 --> 00:13:55.630
They have just put a soul stone which demarcates the end chamber.

228
00:13:55.780 --> 00:13:59.230
This is now out west.
So this is one of the sister sites for new grange.

229
00:14:00.010 --> 00:14:04.810
The passage and the chamber are usually covered in stuff.
So in this case,

230
00:14:05.210 --> 00:14:10.210
and typically what you'll get is a coffin of stone and it's a little bit tumbled

231
00:14:10.631 --> 00:14:12.570
down here.
This is a carrot keel.

232
00:14:12.571 --> 00:14:15.690
That location we mentioned already though,

233
00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:17.580
some monuments are covered in there,

234
00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:21.400
may be loose stone and then they have a soil covering over that or chairs.

235
00:14:21.670 --> 00:14:24.430
This is site based.
So this is the boiling river here,

236
00:14:24.970 --> 00:14:27.670
which surrounds new range and all of these monuments.

237
00:14:27.671 --> 00:14:31.480
And this is new grange here behind and you can see it sort of grass covered and

238
00:14:31.481 --> 00:14:35.740
has a white,
a very striking white quartz front at the front of the monument.

239
00:14:37.810 --> 00:14:40.600
All of the sites tend to have a surrounding circular feature.

240
00:14:41.170 --> 00:14:45.130
So here you can see these large big boulders and Archie on worked around the

241
00:14:45.131 --> 00:14:47.350
monument and then the central chamber here,

242
00:14:48.610 --> 00:14:53.270
but many that we'll have these uh,
curb stones that are laying flash.

243
00:14:53.540 --> 00:14:57.680
And at new grange,
this is new grand here,
that between two and five tones.

244
00:14:58.220 --> 00:15:02.870
So you can imagine what's involved in moving those stones.
The largest,
uh,

245
00:15:02.871 --> 00:15:04.100
is over seven times.

246
00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:07.070
<v 2>Okay.</v>

247
00:15:07.070 --> 00:15:12.070
<v 1>One of the lovely features of these monuments is that they have art and lots of</v>

248
00:15:12.201 --> 00:15:15.860
us,
uh,
we sometimes think of Ireland as a receiver of influences.
You know,

249
00:15:15.861 --> 00:15:20.861
we get what's coming from silicon valley or from Britain or from European laws

250
00:15:23.811 --> 00:15:28.640
or whatever it is.
But in this period,
Ireland was a Capitol of passive tomorrow.

251
00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:32.240
And we can actually see art that seems to have his home here spreading out to

252
00:15:32.241 --> 00:15:35.450
other places,
such as whales and the Orkney islands and so on.

253
00:15:36.020 --> 00:15:37.010
There's a picture I took,

254
00:15:37.011 --> 00:15:40.400
I think it's my only good picture of this presentation actually.

255
00:15:40.730 --> 00:15:44.090
So I took it about seven or eight years ago in a snowy time at new grange.

256
00:15:44.091 --> 00:15:47.240
And you can see the snow has just brought up,
uh,
the decoration beauty,

257
00:15:47.241 --> 00:15:51.500
and you can see how composed it as,
this isn't the kind of haphazard decoration

258
00:15:53.270 --> 00:15:56.480
we think of kind of one,
um,
type of art.
You know,

259
00:15:56.481 --> 00:15:58.400
when you say to people passes to March and they go,
yeah,

260
00:15:58.430 --> 00:16:02.350
the spirals and the lozenges and so on.
Actually,
there's lots of types of,

261
00:16:02.351 --> 00:16:06.080
sometimes he gets very simple,
um,
uh,

262
00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:10.550
symbols that are sometimes have hazardly placed on the stones.
Uh,

263
00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:14.060
those are then placed together and kind of more compositional ways.

264
00:16:14.450 --> 00:16:16.870
And then also they're removing sometimes art.

265
00:16:16.871 --> 00:16:20.690
So you can say somebody has deliberately pecked away all of the skin,

266
00:16:20.750 --> 00:16:24.170
the outer layer of the stone here.
And that you can see,

267
00:16:24.410 --> 00:16:26.540
those of you would equalize,
might be able to spot there.

268
00:16:26.541 --> 00:16:31.070
Can you see the kind of ghost signature of former art there?

269
00:16:31.730 --> 00:16:35.570
Um,
so we have different kinds of passage tomorrow and he was a kind of modern

270
00:16:35.571 --> 00:16:39.040
world.
They were kind of curating the arch.
So we do,

271
00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:41.480
they were deciding which art was now relevant,

272
00:16:41.780 --> 00:16:45.890
which stones we should maybe reuse,
uh,
and so on.

273
00:16:45.890 --> 00:16:50.360
So it was a very kind of,
um,
in tricky and sophisticated,
um,

274
00:16:51.050 --> 00:16:53.840
activities around the art and procedures around us.

275
00:16:55.610 --> 00:16:58.790
One of the big debates that took place over centuries was,

276
00:16:58.791 --> 00:17:02.060
which were the oldest passage tombs.
They come in different sizes,

277
00:17:02.061 --> 00:17:06.940
so you get large ones like queen waves to,
uh,
in county sluggards about,
uh,
uh,

278
00:17:07.460 --> 00:17:12.350
30,000 ton monument.
About 60 meters at the base,
a midsize monument here,

279
00:17:12.490 --> 00:17:15.710
a and then sometimes tiny little Darwin.
So people thought,
oh,

280
00:17:15.711 --> 00:17:19.040
maybe we can work out.
Which came first,
was it kind of a sequence of development?

281
00:17:19.041 --> 00:17:23.180
You know,
we're kind of beige passage tomb or whatever it is.

282
00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:26.830
Um,
so some people thought,
no new grange,
thatW and,

283
00:17:26.860 --> 00:17:31.580
and those money was probably the earliest.
And then as they moved further west,

284
00:17:31.790 --> 00:17:34.850
the monuments get a little bit more simple.
You know,

285
00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:37.070
you're getting away from the center of power,

286
00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:40.130
you've last our last astronomical alignments and so on.

287
00:17:40.340 --> 00:17:41.960
Essentially the further west you come,

288
00:17:42.170 --> 00:17:45.650
the more a degenerate at the monuments become an,

289
00:17:45.651 --> 00:17:49.920
you can imagine the people in the west of our and,
and love that idea.
Um,
um,
but,

290
00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:50.401
uh,

291
00:17:50.401 --> 00:17:54.090
another possibility is that the monument started quite simple and there's almost

292
00:17:54.091 --> 00:17:55.740
a kind of competitive construction.

293
00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:58.530
They seem to get a little bit larger and larger as they go on.

294
00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:01.890
And even when you look at new grange itself,

295
00:18:02.100 --> 00:18:04.530
you can see things that key into that story.

296
00:18:04.830 --> 00:18:08.770
So this is the passage leading up to the chamber here inside a new range.

297
00:18:08.970 --> 00:18:12.480
But you'll notice just above us,
you have these crossings stones,

298
00:18:12.910 --> 00:18:17.790
these are roof stones on above those roof stones.
There's remanence of carving.

299
00:18:18.710 --> 00:18:22.200
And I was fortunate enough to get access up into that area.

300
00:18:22.201 --> 00:18:26.070
Above new grange is kind of a secret tunnel.
I'm a professor,

301
00:18:26.071 --> 00:18:27.330
Oh Kelly who excavated the monument,

302
00:18:27.331 --> 00:18:29.880
recorded all of these carvings and you can see them here.

303
00:18:30.270 --> 00:18:34.830
And these were designed to channel water away from the passage and Irish.

304
00:18:35.430 --> 00:18:38.250
So it's a really,
really clever,
clever design.

305
00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:43.760
And this to me speaks of people who were profoundly aware of the strengths and

306
00:18:44.101 --> 00:18:48.270
weaknesses of these monuments.
They knew the things they needed to adjust,

307
00:18:48.271 --> 00:18:52.060
they knew what they needed to to get it right.
You know.
Um,

308
00:18:52.110 --> 00:18:57.110
so a lot of what I've done in my work has been to try and figure out where that

309
00:18:58.111 --> 00:19:00.560
experience came from.
You know,
what,

310
00:19:00.561 --> 00:19:05.220
why are the origins of Newgrange and particularly by looking at passage tombs

311
00:19:05.490 --> 00:19:09.060
nationally all across the country.
Could we figure out that story?

312
00:19:09.061 --> 00:19:13.470
Could we figure out,
uh,
the origins of these builders of Newgrange?

313
00:19:14.860 --> 00:19:17.550
And then we don't have a scale here,
but just to say these are quite large,

314
00:19:17.820 --> 00:19:20.490
you know,
you could roll a quite a large grapefruit down one of those.

315
00:19:20.490 --> 00:19:22.410
So there's an enormous amount of work involved.

316
00:19:23.940 --> 00:19:26.630
So this is one of the first sites that I looked at.
Uh,

317
00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:31.110
this is Kara more already mentioned,
and this is a horse riding stables here,

318
00:19:31.111 --> 00:19:33.360
but you might just pick out some of these circles.

319
00:19:33.540 --> 00:19:35.160
And in fact they're all over this way,

320
00:19:35.161 --> 00:19:39.210
about 30 of these simple little passage tombs.

321
00:19:39.390 --> 00:19:41.320
And two of them we took material from undecided,

322
00:19:41.321 --> 00:19:45.270
decided to date it to see could we figure out the age if these monuments and

323
00:19:45.271 --> 00:19:47.730
correct sort of controversies about the dating there.

324
00:19:48.180 --> 00:19:51.270
So this is one of them here and you can see it a little bit closer.

325
00:19:51.271 --> 00:19:55.380
This is Kara Mora three.
So you have a boulder circle,
you have a small,

326
00:19:55.680 --> 00:20:00.480
tiny little pathway here or a ceremonial sometimes called a symbolic passage.

327
00:20:00.900 --> 00:20:04.110
And then you had a chamber of where the human remains would have been placed and

328
00:20:04.111 --> 00:20:09.111
also little bits of antler and bone that were made into pins.

329
00:20:09.330 --> 00:20:12.330
And you can see some of the pins here.
So myself and a colleague,

330
00:20:12.331 --> 00:20:15.750
Steph and Berg took tiny little bits of those pins and data them.

331
00:20:16.170 --> 00:20:19.610
And to cut a long story very,
very short,
uh,

332
00:20:19.770 --> 00:20:23.730
what we discovered was that two of the monuments there are probably about 500

333
00:20:23.731 --> 00:20:26.010
years older than new grange.

334
00:20:26.820 --> 00:20:31.820
So the passage tombs story in Ireland is a long story and there's a whole series

335
00:20:32.971 --> 00:20:35.480
of developments leading up to Newgrange.

336
00:20:36.660 --> 00:20:40.720
We could see that also here at Cara Keel.
Isn't this just an extraordinary,
uh,

337
00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:41.341
image here?

338
00:20:41.341 --> 00:20:46.341
This is probably the most dramatically situated of the big four passage tomb

339
00:20:46.411 --> 00:20:48.340
complexes in county slog or here.

340
00:20:49.450 --> 00:20:54.450
And we dated material from inside those monuments and not as old as Kara Moore,

341
00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:57.520
but still about 300 years older than your branch.

342
00:20:57.850 --> 00:21:02.850
So we're beginning to trace the outline of a chronological trajectory of the

343
00:21:03.071 --> 00:21:04.900
construction of these monuments.

344
00:21:06.730 --> 00:21:08.660
Another project was open top of Carrick.

345
00:21:08.661 --> 00:21:11.910
He'll here and we found the very first art,
uh,
at Cara Kale.

346
00:21:11.911 --> 00:21:15.910
This is a colleague from the University of Edinburgh.
And to do this work,

347
00:21:15.911 --> 00:21:18.730
he has very,
very fancy photogrammetry techniques.

348
00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:21.010
And a recording methods he uses on the monuments.

349
00:21:21.011 --> 00:21:25.240
So we had to go up in the middle of the night,
uh,
to use these techniques.

350
00:21:25.241 --> 00:21:29.590
So it was really just us,
the bones of the dead,
uh,
officer,

351
00:21:29.591 --> 00:21:34.270
this very wonderful but slightly eerie experience.
OPEC,
Cara Kale.

352
00:21:34.930 --> 00:21:36.400
This is the monument.
And again,
you know,

353
00:21:36.401 --> 00:21:41.050
talking about these striking a limestone karst,
a landscape here,

354
00:21:41.260 --> 00:21:43.690
you can see this monument here and you can enter it.

355
00:21:44.290 --> 00:21:47.460
And when I was in here one day,
it's difficult to see in the light here.
Uh,

356
00:21:47.590 --> 00:21:48.100
but you,

357
00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:51.520
some of you might just be able to pick out hints of spirals there that was just

358
00:21:51.521 --> 00:21:55.990
on a very basic camera.
But when we processed it,
this is what we discovered.

359
00:21:56.350 --> 00:22:01.210
Very clear spirals zigzags underneath and also another piece of art in this

360
00:22:01.211 --> 00:22:02.350
location here.

361
00:22:03.430 --> 00:22:07.600
So finding art in itself is kind of cool.
Um,

362
00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:10.480
but in one way it's not that big,
big a deal all the time.

363
00:22:10.481 --> 00:22:11.860
We're finding new pieces of our,

364
00:22:12.130 --> 00:22:15.820
what's significant about this is that it was the first time art was found in

365
00:22:15.821 --> 00:22:20.821
this whole complex and we could say now for sure that there was art in all of

366
00:22:20.921 --> 00:22:23.890
the four big main passage tomb complexes in Ireland.

367
00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:28.870
And that's helping us a key into the story of development and changes in the art

368
00:22:28.900 --> 00:22:32.050
over time.
So this is another site,

369
00:22:32.051 --> 00:22:35.620
Millan Bay where we've been working and it's one of the largest collections of

370
00:22:35.621 --> 00:22:37.120
passage tomb art in Ireland.

371
00:22:37.390 --> 00:22:41.410
It's almost like a grammar book of passage tomorrow at one of the methods we've

372
00:22:41.411 --> 00:22:43.180
been using as a kind of micro photogrammetry.

373
00:22:43.180 --> 00:22:47.950
So we're literally looking into the Pec,
uh,
of the person's tool when they,

374
00:22:47.980 --> 00:22:50.380
when they hit the stone and it leaves a little peck mark.

375
00:22:50.830 --> 00:22:53.770
And from that we might be able to,
you know,

376
00:22:54.220 --> 00:22:57.130
possibly identify artists who did similar artworks.

377
00:22:57.490 --> 00:23:01.480
So individual artists or,
um,
you know,

378
00:23:01.481 --> 00:23:03.730
see different techniques that we use for different art.

379
00:23:03.731 --> 00:23:07.810
Or we can see how one art crosses another piece of art quiches older.
So,
again,

380
00:23:07.811 --> 00:23:11.500
we're able to see in this story of developments and changes over time.

381
00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:16.870
But perhaps the most exciting project has been here at Kara Keough boons from

382
00:23:16.871 --> 00:23:20.790
here.
We're taking after an excavation in 1911 and they were brought to somewhere

383
00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:23.380
known as the Duckworth laboratory in Cambridge.

384
00:23:23.890 --> 00:23:28.470
And I was looking up to see those bones for the first time in 2012 and myself

385
00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:32.650
and a group of other researchers have been analyzing them since and we've

386
00:23:32.651 --> 00:23:36.340
discovered lots of stuff.
Um,
so we can say for instance,

387
00:23:36.341 --> 00:23:40.510
how many people were here.
This seems to be about 29 people in all of the,

388
00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:41.920
the bones we found.

389
00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:45.980
So these monuments weren't representing the barriers of the whole community.

390
00:23:45.981 --> 00:23:47.720
It was just a very small group of people.

391
00:23:47.721 --> 00:23:51.520
It seems we can say how many men and women that are,
where,
you know,

392
00:23:51.530 --> 00:23:54.020
how many were children,
how many were adults.
Uh,

393
00:23:54.210 --> 00:23:56.930
and we can see a little bit into their lives,
you know,

394
00:23:56.931 --> 00:24:00.380
the kind of diseases they had,
the stresses on,
their bones and so on.

395
00:24:01.460 --> 00:24:04.640
But finally we can also see into their rituals.

396
00:24:04.670 --> 00:24:08.120
And this is proven to be very exciting because it seems there was different

397
00:24:08.121 --> 00:24:12.050
pathways,
different,
uh,
things that happened to you after death,

398
00:24:12.770 --> 00:24:16.280
possibly depending on who you were in society.
We don't know.

399
00:24:17.300 --> 00:24:19.910
One route was that your body could be cremated.

400
00:24:21.590 --> 00:24:26.020
So a pyre would be built,
this is probably quite a public affair.
Uh,

401
00:24:26.021 --> 00:24:30.740
lots of people gathering and huge heats would've had to been achieved about 800

402
00:24:30.741 --> 00:24:31.491
degrees Celsius.

403
00:24:31.491 --> 00:24:34.190
And we could see it on the little bone cause of course very pale and creamy

404
00:24:34.191 --> 00:24:38.510
color when you get that heat.
So it was quite an industrial process almost.

405
00:24:38.750 --> 00:24:41.480
And then after all of that material had cooled down,

406
00:24:41.481 --> 00:24:45.170
maybe after several days you would go and collect these tiny fragments of

407
00:24:45.171 --> 00:24:49.070
cremated bone and there would be placed in the monument.
So that's one route.

408
00:24:49.071 --> 00:24:50.690
Quite a visceral affair.

409
00:24:50.810 --> 00:24:55.490
You can imagine these fires being seen for miles and miles away.
Um,
so very,

410
00:24:55.491 --> 00:24:57.410
very kind of striking thing to be involved.

411
00:24:57.411 --> 00:25:01.730
And anybody who's been to India and seeing the gats Veranasi we'll know that

412
00:25:01.731 --> 00:25:05.030
kind of charge,
uh,
experienced this can be,

413
00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:08.870
but there was another Rouche it seems.
Um,

414
00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:14.040
so some of the bone that we found was on birch and when we look closely at the

415
00:25:14.271 --> 00:25:16.580
bones,
um,
and our osteologists,

416
00:25:16.670 --> 00:25:20.600
Johnny Gabber identified lots of little cut marks on the bones.

417
00:25:21.390 --> 00:25:26.390
So we found about 12 volts now with this and about 90 cut marks and it seems

418
00:25:26.481 --> 00:25:29.570
there was some very unusual,
um,

419
00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:34.370
and sophisticated if slightly gory sounding,

420
00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:38.000
uh,
procedure happening here where the buddies were dismembered.

421
00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:44.360
So we had two different routes,
ways into the other world.
And as I say,

422
00:25:44.361 --> 00:25:48.770
we're still working out.
We don't know on what basis that decision was made and,

423
00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:50.900
but very unusual.

424
00:25:50.930 --> 00:25:53.540
And we could talk about that a little bit more later if you want.

425
00:25:56.390 --> 00:26:00.860
Um,
again,
another brilliant priority of the project.
We have done,

426
00:26:01.010 --> 00:26:05.330
uh,
ancient DNA DNA analysis on age,

427
00:26:05.930 --> 00:26:08.510
uh,
individuals from Cara Kale.

428
00:26:08.511 --> 00:26:13.140
Six of those gave us successful results and the work was done by Laura Cassady.

429
00:26:13.490 --> 00:26:17.790
Uh,
we haven't fully published that work,
but I can can tell you here,
uh,

430
00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:18.710
for the first time,

431
00:26:18.711 --> 00:26:22.400
I think that those results are in broad agreement with work that Laura has

432
00:26:22.401 --> 00:26:24.380
previously done here on [inaudible],

433
00:26:24.890 --> 00:26:29.890
a woman up in Belfast and she's a person from a similar period to also buried in

434
00:26:30.501 --> 00:26:32.550
a megalithic monument.
Uh,

435
00:26:32.560 --> 00:26:37.560
so she's a neolithic individual and what it showed that she was of Anatole

436
00:26:38.360 --> 00:26:43.340
Anatolian descent.
So that's largely the area around Turkey and,

437
00:26:44.310 --> 00:26:47.790
uh,
sort of next door to the Fertile Crescent.
You know,

438
00:26:47.791 --> 00:26:52.080
all those areas we hear about in the Middle East,
Lebanon,
Syria,

439
00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:56.340
as fascinating to think Syrian refugees coming to Ireland now.

440
00:26:56.790 --> 00:27:01.790
And our first farmers were coming from relatively similar part of the world.

441
00:27:03.270 --> 00:27:08.100
And we can also say things like that.
Their hair was dark brown.

442
00:27:08.101 --> 00:27:11.850
Typically you're often black.
They had brown eyes,

443
00:27:12.540 --> 00:27:14.910
although variant for blue was also discovered.

444
00:27:15.300 --> 00:27:19.110
So we're finally beginning to answer those questions.
Um,

445
00:27:19.260 --> 00:27:21.330
that I mentioned at the very start of this talk.

446
00:27:21.331 --> 00:27:24.210
Who were these people and where did they come from?

447
00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:30.050
So before gps there was strontium.

448
00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:32.390
If you guys want to find out where somebody being,

449
00:27:32.391 --> 00:27:35.330
you might look at their social media,
where they checked in this,
that,

450
00:27:35.331 --> 00:27:36.050
and the other.

451
00:27:36.050 --> 00:27:41.050
You can't do that 5,000 years ago with what you can do is look at strong diem.

452
00:27:43.460 --> 00:27:47.630
This is quite a complicated thing,
so I'm going to make it very quick.
Stolen.

453
00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:51.830
Contagious contains a trace element called strontium.
When the stone breaks down,

454
00:27:51.831 --> 00:27:55.310
that goes into the soil and it goes into the water,
into the plants,

455
00:27:55.580 --> 00:27:59.390
into the animals,
into us.
When we develop teeth,

456
00:27:59.450 --> 00:28:00.890
it takes up tiny,

457
00:28:00.891 --> 00:28:04.250
infinitesimally tiny amounts of strontium and that can be measured.

458
00:28:04.580 --> 00:28:09.020
And through measuring that,
we can tell the kind of bedrock that you grew up on.

459
00:28:10.730 --> 00:28:11.563
<v 2>Okay?</v>

460
00:28:12.090 --> 00:28:14.970
<v 1>You're going to have to take my word first.
It sounds a bit magical,</v>

461
00:28:14.971 --> 00:28:16.740
but it's true.
Um,

462
00:28:16.741 --> 00:28:20.640
so when we looked at the remains of 14 different people,
uh,

463
00:28:20.700 --> 00:28:25.080
from Kara Keough,
we saw the vast majority of the had grown up in the local area.

464
00:28:25.380 --> 00:28:26.760
So there are deep ancestry,

465
00:28:26.761 --> 00:28:31.620
might be the fertile crescent or Anatolia Bush there.

466
00:28:31.621 --> 00:28:35.850
Where they grew up was in the northwest of Ireland.
Curiously,

467
00:28:35.851 --> 00:28:37.590
three people didn't fit that bill.

468
00:28:37.591 --> 00:28:41.190
They seem to grow and open a slightly milder climate may be here or somewhere.

469
00:28:41.820 --> 00:28:44.880
Um,
two of them could have been from elsewhere in Ireland,
would,

470
00:28:44.881 --> 00:28:46.740
one of them appears,

471
00:28:46.741 --> 00:28:51.741
grew up somewhere in central Europe and as has a very unusual signature to the

472
00:28:51.971 --> 00:28:56.730
strontium.
So again,
it just makes the picture ever more interesting.

473
00:28:56.920 --> 00:29:01.080
And this is confirmed by the DNA as well because it's showing that the people

474
00:29:01.081 --> 00:29:05.370
buried in the tombs that we looked at,
they weren't even related,
you know?

475
00:29:05.371 --> 00:29:09.570
So again,
you know,
it's still something we're trying to figure out,

476
00:29:09.571 --> 00:29:12.450
but the story just keeps getting more and more interesting in a way.

477
00:29:13.950 --> 00:29:18.930
So what does all this mean for you guys?
Um,
those,
this Havana,
you know,
could,

478
00:29:18.931 --> 00:29:22.470
uh,
tell us anything about today?
Is that of any relevance to the future?

479
00:29:23.250 --> 00:29:24.780
Going to argue that it is,

480
00:29:25.980 --> 00:29:28.950
and you might be surprised to hear that these people in some ways,

481
00:29:28.951 --> 00:29:31.170
we're in some ways a little bit like you.

482
00:29:32.010 --> 00:29:34.800
So one thing we can say is that we're a very young population.

483
00:29:37.210 --> 00:29:39.060
Um,
I believe this is a prank.

484
00:29:39.061 --> 00:29:44.061
Is it that you guys played on the view camera's going by or something sometime

485
00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:49.360
ago?
I Dunno,
that's,
that's what I'm told anyway.
But uh,
people in the Neolithic,

486
00:29:49.361 --> 00:29:53.020
we're very young.
Osteologists would be a little bit wary about giving,
you know,

487
00:29:53.170 --> 00:29:56.080
averages for the whole of the Neolithic and Ireland or a particular region.

488
00:29:56.320 --> 00:30:00.580
But we know from individual sites,
individuals are often under the age of 30.

489
00:30:00.670 --> 00:30:04.800
It's very common at the first analysis in 1911 off the remains from curriculars

490
00:30:04.801 --> 00:30:09.801
in most individuals around 25 as sometimes women younger than men as an average

491
00:30:10.121 --> 00:30:12.670
age of that.
So they were very,
very young population

492
00:30:14.560 --> 00:30:18.880
also,
as we know from our previous slides that came from foreign lands.

493
00:30:19.180 --> 00:30:23.500
So they probably brought different languages,
you know,
that done that.

494
00:30:23.530 --> 00:30:25.330
Then the people here would have spoken.

495
00:30:25.540 --> 00:30:28.760
They would have had different religious beliefs,
maybe,
um,

496
00:30:29.350 --> 00:30:33.760
different food preferences and different clothing.

497
00:30:33.880 --> 00:30:38.880
Maybe I'm not suggesting this is what you guys were on the weekend or anything,

498
00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:42.780
but,
uh,
you know,
a lot of differences,
a lot of changes there.

499
00:30:42.781 --> 00:30:46.300
We're bringing in new life,
new ways of thinking,
a whole new world view,

500
00:30:46.301 --> 00:30:50.350
really a whole way of proceeding at the world around them differently.

501
00:30:52.390 --> 00:30:56.590
One of the things we know about new grange was that it was a community affair.

502
00:30:56.591 --> 00:30:58.000
It was a collective affair.

503
00:30:58.330 --> 00:31:01.840
So to build the monument of course required lots and lots of people,

504
00:31:01.841 --> 00:31:03.700
hundreds if not thousands of people,

505
00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:08.880
but even just to gather the materials and an enormous amount of people.

506
00:31:09.430 --> 00:31:10.960
So we know some of the materials.

507
00:31:10.961 --> 00:31:15.730
So the white Cortes came from the Wicklow mountains that 70 kilometers to the

508
00:31:15.731 --> 00:31:19.960
south east.
A lot of the other material,

509
00:31:19.961 --> 00:31:23.500
they mourn granites and Yuri granted rights.

510
00:31:23.680 --> 00:31:26.170
They were collected on the north shore of Don Dark Bay.

511
00:31:26.650 --> 00:31:28.780
And some of these enormous stones here,

512
00:31:28.781 --> 00:31:31.630
impossible as it is to believe were brought from Claire her head.

513
00:31:32.020 --> 00:31:35.210
So that's several kilometers out along the River Boyne uh,

514
00:31:35.250 --> 00:31:36.730
and then up the coast by boat,

515
00:31:37.420 --> 00:31:40.660
somehow with a big bolt presumably,

516
00:31:40.930 --> 00:31:44.430
and somehow bringing back these really large stones,
uh,

517
00:31:44.431 --> 00:31:48.220
and then up the slope to new grange or alternatively coming across land,

518
00:31:48.250 --> 00:31:52.090
which seems almost impossible to conceive to through forests.
You know,

519
00:31:52.091 --> 00:31:56.170
over undulating ground,
either way it seems impossible,

520
00:31:56.171 --> 00:31:59.170
but we can say for sure now that's some of that material concert there.

521
00:31:59.171 --> 00:32:02.320
And even some of the courts may come from rocket island here.

522
00:32:02.530 --> 00:32:06.070
It's recently been suggested.
So we knew they were moving by water as well.

523
00:32:07.360 --> 00:32:12.100
So these days we talk about crowd sourcing,
crowd funding,

524
00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:16.930
uh,
these kinds of ideas and clever people have broken down,
you know,

525
00:32:16.931 --> 00:32:19.270
the kind of features and factors involved in that.

526
00:32:19.450 --> 00:32:22.720
So things like collective knowledge,
collective creativity,

527
00:32:22.990 --> 00:32:25.420
community building and innovation,

528
00:32:25.421 --> 00:32:28.180
the kind of stuff you guys have been involved with.
And would,

529
00:32:28.181 --> 00:32:31.990
I'd suggest to you that with a lot of these newer models and maybe new

530
00:32:32.170 --> 00:32:33.003
technologies,

531
00:32:33.130 --> 00:32:38.130
is it possible we're told him returning to very old ideas and older models.

532
00:32:38.590 --> 00:32:39.423
In fact,

533
00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:43.550
one thing we can say that Neolithic people were very good at is in acknowledging

534
00:32:43.551 --> 00:32:45.370
death.
Um,

535
00:32:45.410 --> 00:32:48.950
and it's something that maybe we're not so good at these days ourselves.

536
00:32:48.951 --> 00:32:53.030
So death was very much front and center of Neolithic community.

537
00:32:53.031 --> 00:32:57.230
So this is queen may is too with a very large,
uh,
passage tomb on the top.

538
00:32:57.231 --> 00:33:01.220
And it can be seen for miles and miles around from great distances.

539
00:33:02.500 --> 00:33:07.070
As I said,
the monuments may not have contained a lot of human remains,

540
00:33:07.071 --> 00:33:09.980
a lot of people,
but they didn't need to to serve as an emblem.

541
00:33:10.250 --> 00:33:12.140
Just by seeing this thing from afar,

542
00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:16.670
you had this fairly striking emblem of death and the afterworld,
again,

543
00:33:16.671 --> 00:33:20.060
isn't this another extraordinary picture here by Ken Williams?

544
00:33:20.260 --> 00:33:22.700
This is a new range at night.
Um,

545
00:33:23.150 --> 00:33:27.080
and monuments like Newgrange you could say there were a little bit like momentum

546
00:33:27.081 --> 00:33:30.680
Maura,
you know,
the skull on the medieval philosophers desk,
you know,

547
00:33:30.681 --> 00:33:34.880
you'd want to check in and it would remind you of death and what's important in

548
00:33:34.881 --> 00:33:37.520
life,
what's notch.
Um,

549
00:33:37.580 --> 00:33:42.580
so Philly dish and Pangea 1671 created this image and he boils it down to three

550
00:33:43.671 --> 00:33:47.570
things.
We have life,
death and time.

551
00:33:48.590 --> 00:33:52.880
And you could say those three areas are founded new grand.

552
00:33:53.040 --> 00:33:57.980
So a huge life force involved in creating a monument of this scale.

553
00:33:58.040 --> 00:34:00.440
Molting be motivating people to do this work.

554
00:34:01.090 --> 00:34:06.090
Had a terrific emblem of death and the ancestors and the afterworld and also

555
00:34:08.211 --> 00:34:12.570
time through the winter solstice alignment.
You have this kind of centralized,
uh,

556
00:34:12.590 --> 00:34:17.390
captured time if you like,
within the monument.
Another area,

557
00:34:17.660 --> 00:34:18.140
uh,

558
00:34:18.140 --> 00:34:21.200
that they were concerned with seems to be not only the winter solstice but the

559
00:34:21.201 --> 00:34:26.030
turning seasons.
So we have the winter solstice alignment here at new grange,

560
00:34:26.031 --> 00:34:29.060
but there are other monuments that do the summer solstice alignment.

561
00:34:29.510 --> 00:34:33.560
Some do the sunrise,
some do this on sash.
Uh,

562
00:34:33.561 --> 00:34:37.940
there's arguments about it,
but some may also have equinox alignments.

563
00:34:38.150 --> 00:34:41.780
So you can see these people are charting the course of the song all the way

564
00:34:41.781 --> 00:34:46.190
through the year.
And this is a very interesting thing.
You have,
uh,

565
00:34:46.220 --> 00:34:48.050
the cultural historian,

566
00:34:48.290 --> 00:34:52.640
Thomas Berry has talked about our need for a new arts story,
uh,

567
00:34:52.790 --> 00:34:56.030
particularly in the middle of our current environmental difficulties.

568
00:34:56.390 --> 00:34:59.930
And at Newbury.
And here you have kind of an instant cosmic liturgy.

569
00:35:00.290 --> 00:35:03.020
You could look at the art through the year.

570
00:35:03.021 --> 00:35:06.470
You look at the birth and death of the son through the year.
Uh,

571
00:35:06.550 --> 00:35:11.300
and we can supplement that story with our knowledge of the cosmos and the art's

572
00:35:11.301 --> 00:35:12.590
place in the universe.

573
00:35:13.060 --> 00:35:18.060
So you have the cosmological story here in waiting in Newgrange and potentially

574
00:35:18.651 --> 00:35:20.600
important for us going into the future.

575
00:35:22.760 --> 00:35:27.760
Could new grain say something to us about data storage,

576
00:35:28.370 --> 00:35:33.110
transfer of knowledge,
communication I'd suggested could,

577
00:35:33.560 --> 00:35:37.830
so one of the things it did as that we can go to the monument today and if we're

578
00:35:37.831 --> 00:35:39.360
lucky enough to win the lottery,

579
00:35:39.361 --> 00:35:43.590
we can be in there on the day of the winter solstice and see the sunlight coming

580
00:35:43.591 --> 00:35:47.100
into the monument today.
We talk about,
you know,

581
00:35:47.190 --> 00:35:50.310
virtual reality and the potential of that in the future.

582
00:35:50.700 --> 00:35:52.770
Maybe this isn't quite virtual reality,

583
00:35:53.010 --> 00:35:56.220
but to be able to stay stand in the same monument,

584
00:35:56.221 --> 00:36:00.960
in the same chamber and see the sunlight just as Neolithic people did,
you know,

585
00:36:00.961 --> 00:36:05.130
did they deliver their message?
They sure did in an extraordinary way.

586
00:36:07.050 --> 00:36:11.070
We don't know what the art means.
We have lots and lots of good guesses,

587
00:36:11.640 --> 00:36:13.350
but really we can't comprehend it.

588
00:36:13.650 --> 00:36:16.560
But what we can say for sure is that it was delivered.
You know,

589
00:36:16.561 --> 00:36:18.570
it may be in a hundred years,
they're in a thousand years.

590
00:36:18.571 --> 00:36:22.680
It's somebody figures this out and surely it's meaningful.
You know,

591
00:36:22.681 --> 00:36:27.420
when you look at this has to be so many to it,
we can't nail it down.

592
00:36:27.750 --> 00:36:32.250
Um,
but it's,
it's not,
it's not accidental.
It's not haphazard.

593
00:36:32.280 --> 00:36:36.420
This kind of art.
So we can say that they delivered their message and not regard.

594
00:36:38.040 --> 00:36:41.250
And again,
they're precious cargo of the bones of the dead.

595
00:36:41.430 --> 00:36:45.240
This has arrived forward into the future too.
So again,
this is another way,

596
00:36:45.420 --> 00:36:49.140
you know,
we talk about ones and Zeros and maybe people have concerns about the

597
00:36:49.141 --> 00:36:52.770
vulnerability of data.
Here we have an enormous amount of data.
True.

598
00:36:52.771 --> 00:36:53.920
The winter solstice alignment,

599
00:36:53.921 --> 00:36:58.800
true the art through the bones of the dead that's been sent 5,000 years into the

600
00:36:58.801 --> 00:37:01.950
future.
And extraordinary accomplishment.
And again,

601
00:37:01.970 --> 00:37:06.090
there are not their lives for tens of thousands of years at people were hunter

602
00:37:06.091 --> 00:37:09.600
gatherers and new grange can tell us things about the environment and our

603
00:37:09.601 --> 00:37:12.550
relationship to the environment.
Um,

604
00:37:12.930 --> 00:37:17.730
so what happens in the Neolithic is that people settle down for the first time.

605
00:37:17.910 --> 00:37:19.650
And a lot of our modern innovations,

606
00:37:19.651 --> 00:37:24.651
whether it's biotechnology or advanced genetics that come from the types of

607
00:37:25.531 --> 00:37:29.250
things that Neolithic people were doing originally.
So there were domesticating,

608
00:37:29.660 --> 00:37:33.930
uh,
the world around them.
They were harnessing the natural world.
Um,

609
00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:38.430
there were domesticating plants and animals and breeding them and so on.

610
00:37:38.730 --> 00:37:42.180
And it's not that leads directly to our modern genetics and so on,

611
00:37:42.510 --> 00:37:47.430
but arguably has the full crib turned too far in one direction.

612
00:37:47.850 --> 00:37:50.550
So one estimate has it.
When new grange was built,

613
00:37:50.551 --> 00:37:53.640
there was 25 million people in the world.

614
00:37:54.660 --> 00:37:55.710
This is Shanghai.

615
00:37:55.860 --> 00:38:00.860
The population of Shanghai is 25 million people and the Neolithic,

616
00:38:01.411 --> 00:38:02.640
when new branch was built in Ireland,

617
00:38:02.910 --> 00:38:06.680
a very rough estimate that's been thrown out about 150,000 people,
uh,

618
00:38:06.890 --> 00:38:11.280
living in Ireland at that time.
So our populations have increased dramatically.

619
00:38:11.640 --> 00:38:15.270
At the same time,
our animal populations are in free fall.

620
00:38:15.660 --> 00:38:18.480
So surely we need to make some kind of adjustment there.

621
00:38:19.530 --> 00:38:24.180
And returning to the Neolithic,
you know,
the simplicity of life.

622
00:38:24.510 --> 00:38:24.810
Uh,

623
00:38:24.810 --> 00:38:27.720
one thing that we know when the commentators often say is there are monuments.

624
00:38:27.721 --> 00:38:32.460
They're communal buildings.
They put enormous efforts into Ed with their houses.

625
00:38:32.640 --> 00:38:36.040
Sometimes a little bit more modest,
you know,
maybe didn't last as long,

626
00:38:36.041 --> 00:38:40.480
not as visible in the record.
And maybe something that's we need to consider too,

627
00:38:40.750 --> 00:38:45.750
moving away a little bit from the individual or the family and towards wider

628
00:38:46.540 --> 00:38:50.170
communal efforts and maybe to use less resources and so on.
And our building too.

629
00:38:50.650 --> 00:38:55.650
So stepping into the kind of archeological time machine and looking back can be

630
00:38:56.021 --> 00:39:00.850
a way to help us readjust our priorities.
So in conclusion,

631
00:39:01.450 --> 00:39:02.140
um,

632
00:39:02.140 --> 00:39:06.610
I think new grange and this period has a lot to say to us,

633
00:39:07.420 --> 00:39:08.140
for sure.

634
00:39:08.140 --> 00:39:13.140
We can say that they honor their ancestors and they were aware of their past.

635
00:39:14.850 --> 00:39:16.330
They were all too aware of the future,

636
00:39:16.530 --> 00:39:20.440
and they delivered a message successfully into the future.

637
00:39:22.030 --> 00:39:22.863
And

638
00:39:24.670 --> 00:39:28.150
that way they remind us reading,
uh,
you know,
the,

639
00:39:28.151 --> 00:39:32.170
we also need to think about the past.
We need to consider a future generations,

640
00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:34.510
make progressive choices,
uh,

641
00:39:34.511 --> 00:39:39.250
work as one community and leave a good legacy for the people to come.

642
00:39:39.460 --> 00:39:44.460
Can we leave a legacy that is as wondrous as profound and maybe as instructive,

643
00:39:45.330 --> 00:39:50.140
uh,
as the people that built new ranch left doors.
Thank you.

644
00:39:57.640 --> 00:40:02.230
Thank you.
Robert is a fascinating and a beautiful presentation.

645
00:40:02.530 --> 00:40:03.363
Um,

646
00:40:03.940 --> 00:40:08.940
I'm very relevant as well in so many ways that you've made us for us today.

647
00:40:09.130 --> 00:40:11.650
And there are loads of questions that I have for you.

648
00:40:11.651 --> 00:40:13.060
I'm not really sure where to begin.

649
00:40:13.360 --> 00:40:15.780
What thing that astounded me early on in your,

650
00:40:15.781 --> 00:40:19.780
your talk was the number of passage tombs across the country.

651
00:40:19.960 --> 00:40:24.340
Do we know what percentage of them have any kind of astronomical orientation?

652
00:40:24.460 --> 00:40:27.070
Yeah.
You said it's very,
does not just what your soul's just yes,

653
00:40:27.850 --> 00:40:29.110
there has been work done on it.

654
00:40:29.111 --> 00:40:34.111
And this guy called Frank Prendergast from dit and he looked at 138 monuments.

655
00:40:35.260 --> 00:40:38.440
Uh,
that's where it started in good enough condition and that had a passage that

656
00:40:38.441 --> 00:40:41.110
could be measured.
Uh,
and you just go over that.

657
00:40:41.111 --> 00:40:45.250
About 24 of them across the country had some kind of,

658
00:40:45.760 --> 00:40:50.200
um,
relationship,
uh,
with the song in particular.

659
00:40:50.200 --> 00:40:54.070
Nothing to the moon or to the stars or anything like that at all of those.

660
00:40:54.071 --> 00:40:57.390
Some of them might be accidental.
So you know,

661
00:40:57.391 --> 00:40:59.920
in your bathroom at home or whatever it is,

662
00:40:59.921 --> 00:41:02.620
that might be just one room in the house that has particularly good life.

663
00:41:03.380 --> 00:41:07.510
No money in my hands.
It yourselves.
So some of them could be accidental.

664
00:41:07.511 --> 00:41:10.780
There are a little bit off perfect dot kind of thing.
But a rose face.

665
00:41:10.800 --> 00:41:14.290
Small percent.
Yeah.
Okay.
That's interesting and interesting that it's the sun.

666
00:41:14.860 --> 00:41:19.850
It's the song in particular.
Yeah.
The moon is a much more tricky affair.
Oh,

667
00:41:20.020 --> 00:41:22.480
much more difficult to,
to stars as well.

668
00:41:22.481 --> 00:41:25.990
It would be much more difficult even if they had to discover if they were

669
00:41:25.991 --> 00:41:29.120
aligned to a star.
Okay.
That's very interesting.
Um,

670
00:41:29.140 --> 00:41:32.050
do we know who,
um,

671
00:41:32.740 --> 00:41:34.190
who was in the tombs or

672
00:41:34.190 --> 00:41:37.790
<v 3>why a certain person,
was it like landowners or chief done?</v>

673
00:41:38.360 --> 00:41:42.950
<v 1>Yeah,
I mean the evidence from Kara Kale is showing,</v>

674
00:41:42.980 --> 00:41:47.540
uh,
is,
is sort of filling in that picture a little bit for us.
And it's difficult.

675
00:41:47.541 --> 00:41:52.040
You can't say it's no obvious group.
It's not just sort of old men.
You know,

676
00:41:52.280 --> 00:41:54.890
the sort of big mound,
the chieftain,
um,

677
00:41:55.220 --> 00:41:58.850
it's not just sort of families or that kind of thing.

678
00:41:59.120 --> 00:42:03.970
There seems to be people of all ages.
Um,
um,

679
00:42:04.250 --> 00:42:05.430
uh,
carer cue,

680
00:42:06.110 --> 00:42:10.190
the osteological analysis said about nine men if memory serves me right and

681
00:42:10.191 --> 00:42:13.410
about four women could be identified.
Um,

682
00:42:13.580 --> 00:42:16.700
but beyond that we really can't say on what basis they were selected.

683
00:42:16.701 --> 00:42:18.710
It's certainly wasn't a whole community.

684
00:42:19.220 --> 00:42:23.960
So if you imagine these sites in use for three,
400 years,
you know,

685
00:42:23.990 --> 00:42:27.410
on some remains maybe put in every year,
you know,

686
00:42:28.630 --> 00:42:31.910
<v 3>tiny,
tiny amount.
It has to be.
Yeah.
Um,</v>

687
00:42:33.150 --> 00:42:34.000
you mentioned in the talk,

688
00:42:34.001 --> 00:42:36.370
I'll just ask more question before I go to audience Q and.
A.

689
00:42:36.371 --> 00:42:41.371
But you mentioned for a new grange how far away a lot of the material was taken

690
00:42:42.461 --> 00:42:46.570
from like some of the taken from the Wicklow mountains then from an island.

691
00:42:47.260 --> 00:42:51.020
Do we have any information details on,
on how that was

692
00:42:51.100 --> 00:42:51.933
<v 1>nails?</v>

693
00:42:51.990 --> 00:42:56.670
There's theories and so some people would suggest suggest going across the land

694
00:42:56.671 --> 00:42:59.220
is good.
And when you look sort of ethnographically,
uh,

695
00:42:59.260 --> 00:43:03.180
there's examples where people did that and it involved often the chief standing

696
00:43:03.181 --> 00:43:07.500
up on this massive stone has lots of people moved it and he's saying,

697
00:43:07.620 --> 00:43:09.690
I'm an important person,
you know,

698
00:43:09.900 --> 00:43:13.950
and this is how many people I can influence to come and do this project.

699
00:43:13.951 --> 00:43:15.750
And if they didn't like the chieftain,

700
00:43:15.780 --> 00:43:18.810
maybe they might sort of ditch the stoner breakage or you know,

701
00:43:19.170 --> 00:43:20.910
something like that in some cases.

702
00:43:21.210 --> 00:43:24.580
But a lot of people have suggested it was moved by water.
Um,

703
00:43:24.630 --> 00:43:28.990
so there are some kind of tentative evidence of drop stones in the river that

704
00:43:29.010 --> 00:43:31.170
didn't successfully make it.
Um,

705
00:43:31.260 --> 00:43:35.900
and Jolene stowage in particular has looked at a method whereby a stolen would

706
00:43:35.901 --> 00:43:39.600
be tied underneath the bone.
I wonder,
need a bolt at low tide.

707
00:43:40.470 --> 00:43:41.610
And then as the tide comes in,

708
00:43:41.611 --> 00:43:45.330
the boat lifts stone lifts to under good the salt in the water.

709
00:43:45.600 --> 00:43:49.800
It helps make it less of a burden and a,

710
00:43:49.801 --> 00:43:54.770
and moved it that way.
Bush,
you know,
incredibly difficult,
probably dangerous.
Um,

711
00:43:54.780 --> 00:43:58.290
and,
and what an accomplishment to be able to do.
It's just,
it's,
you know,

712
00:43:58.291 --> 00:44:02.040
even as an,
and we know this stuff to say,
it is just extraordinary,

713
00:44:02.140 --> 00:44:05.260
<v 3>you know.
Go ahead.
Oh,</v>

714
00:44:05.261 --> 00:44:08.800
we do lots of questions from the audience.
I'll pop this on to you there.

715
00:44:09.610 --> 00:44:13.450
Does any of the arts in the passage tombs have human figures,

716
00:44:13.840 --> 00:44:18.840
figures in it or is it all sort of the geometric type designs and that that you

717
00:44:19.661 --> 00:44:20.560
had in the photos?

718
00:44:21.040 --> 00:44:24.780
<v 1>Yeah,
there are a couple of examples that do look at triple morphic.</v>

719
00:44:24.790 --> 00:44:29.320
They look like human faces and some scholars such as Maricia,

720
00:44:29.330 --> 00:44:33.270
surely one in UCD has,
has suggested some of these might be faces.

721
00:44:33.600 --> 00:44:36.300
It's a very difficult one because even I know myself,

722
00:44:36.330 --> 00:44:39.210
you look at art and we want to see things.
Uh,

723
00:44:39.240 --> 00:44:43.980
the human mind is programmed to see patterns and particularly we've a very

724
00:44:43.981 --> 00:44:46.050
strong kind of obviously for obvious reasons,

725
00:44:46.170 --> 00:44:49.320
the association with the human face.
So we want to see it.

726
00:44:49.321 --> 00:44:52.590
So it's one of these things that's debated or other people have suggested.

727
00:44:52.591 --> 00:44:57.210
You can see sort of snake,
like things in the art.
I possibly trees and ferns.

728
00:44:57.670 --> 00:45:00.450
Um,
but we just don't know,
you know,

729
00:45:00.451 --> 00:45:04.320
beyond getting a time machine and going back with a microphone.

730
00:45:04.830 --> 00:45:07.140
I was getting question.
We probably will never know.

731
00:45:07.690 --> 00:45:12.050
<v 3>Hi.
Um,
going back to the ID at where you were saying dead,
uh,</v>

732
00:45:12.170 --> 00:45:15.670
it's not everybody for sure that was buried there.
Uh,

733
00:45:15.680 --> 00:45:20.680
I wanted to ask you like if there was traces of other burial places,

734
00:45:22.210 --> 00:45:24.650
like where were the other people buried?

735
00:45:24.660 --> 00:45:29.660
If it was not everybody there and if you could find any clue on how they were

736
00:45:30.491 --> 00:45:34.020
different from the people that was buried in passage.

737
00:45:35.130 --> 00:45:36.130
<v 1>Yeah,
I mean it's,</v>

738
00:45:36.170 --> 00:45:39.730
it's funny cause you read archeology books sometimes and you see the show while,

739
00:45:40.470 --> 00:45:43.380
how was that in the Neolithic and the show a picture of a megalithic term,

740
00:45:43.680 --> 00:45:46.950
but we know it was just a tiny percentage of people.
So it's a quick question.

741
00:45:46.951 --> 00:45:49.680
Where were the other people buried?
Now we do,
oh,
of course.

742
00:45:49.681 --> 00:45:54.260
I've mentioned just one type of passage to,
uh,
or what type of megalithic term,

743
00:45:54.261 --> 00:45:56.040
rather the passage tomb,
but that were olders.

744
00:45:56.370 --> 00:45:59.460
So there were other places that people would have been buried.
All so,

745
00:45:59.820 --> 00:46:02.250
but beyond that,
you know,
um,
you know,

746
00:46:02.251 --> 00:46:05.550
cremated remains could have been born in a river,
you know,

747
00:46:05.590 --> 00:46:08.970
they could have been buried.
We don't know.
Um,

748
00:46:09.030 --> 00:46:13.980
I was reading recently about rituals and contemporary rituals in Tibet and,

749
00:46:14.180 --> 00:46:15.720
um,
where you look across the world,

750
00:46:15.730 --> 00:46:19.900
you see variation is the norm actually work quite,
um,

751
00:46:20.280 --> 00:46:23.850
narrowed in to Justin burial,
primarily in Ireland and a little bit cremation.

752
00:46:23.850 --> 00:46:25.650
Now when you look elsewhere across the words,

753
00:46:25.651 --> 00:46:28.260
you see lots of different types of things happening in the one society.

754
00:46:28.620 --> 00:46:31.930
So in Tibet you might have sky burial or a,

755
00:46:32.120 --> 00:46:35.880
a body was placed out and uh,
the flesh would definitely,

756
00:46:35.910 --> 00:46:39.270
the body would decompose the flesh with might be taken away by Korean birds.

757
00:46:39.750 --> 00:46:43.290
They would have cremation and they would have burial in humiliation.

758
00:46:43.320 --> 00:46:47.620
The body was placed in the ground.
And then some people also it would be,
uh,

759
00:46:47.760 --> 00:46:51.990
but through water.
So those four distinct methods and it's,

760
00:46:52.030 --> 00:46:56.610
it's possible,
you know,
that there was a similar amount of methods in Ireland.

761
00:46:58.270 --> 00:47:00.540
<v 3>Oh,
that's great.
Yeah.
Really good question.
Do we have anymore,</v>

762
00:47:01.230 --> 00:47:03.450
another audience question?
Yeah,
just to get the funds.

763
00:47:05.770 --> 00:47:07.870
<v 4>Thank you for the great presentation.
Very welcome.</v>

764
00:47:08.710 --> 00:47:13.480
My question would be probably not very,
very much related to the,

765
00:47:13.540 --> 00:47:18.010
uh,
to these particular,
uh,
grapes.
Uh,
my,

766
00:47:18.250 --> 00:47:22.360
my question is like,
how do we have these things?

767
00:47:22.600 --> 00:47:26.920
So like a distinguishably scene where put an overnight,

768
00:47:27.700 --> 00:47:31.720
why,
why,
why it,
why would they not,
uh,

769
00:47:33.030 --> 00:47:38.030
w with an ob there with a layer of dirt or earth and need and have to be

770
00:47:39.731 --> 00:47:41.930
escalated,
like for example,
in Metro,

771
00:47:41.950 --> 00:47:44.650
like only a certain percent that she's out there.

772
00:47:44.770 --> 00:47:48.860
So is it because of the climate or like what,
what would be the main reason?
Hmm.

773
00:47:49.330 --> 00:47:52.840
<v 1>Well,
your question points to something very interesting,
you know,</v>

774
00:47:52.841 --> 00:47:56.980
for a burial,
for a grave,
um,
you know,

775
00:47:56.981 --> 00:48:00.310
really all we need is to dig a place in the ground.
You know,

776
00:48:00.760 --> 00:48:04.810
and what several people have pointed out is that clearly what's happening here

777
00:48:05.440 --> 00:48:09.190
is,
requires much greater efforts and Nash,

778
00:48:09.760 --> 00:48:13.790
and is it really correct to call it a tomb at all,
uh,

779
00:48:13.810 --> 00:48:18.190
from that point of view.
So a lot of what's happening here is symbolic.
You know,

780
00:48:18.191 --> 00:48:21.610
that you can see the monument from very far the decoration,

781
00:48:22.060 --> 00:48:26.680
the winter solstice alignment that comes in,
it's suggested was much more here.

782
00:48:26.690 --> 00:48:31.690
This and much more meaning than just about simple burial,

783
00:48:33.650 --> 00:48:37.770
<v 4>but,
but do think they have been preserved during the ages.
So like,</v>

784
00:48:37.820 --> 00:48:42.070
like different generations,
they tried to not,
uh,

785
00:48:42.150 --> 00:48:46.950
not to make them be being forgotten,
like,
you know,
excavate them,

786
00:48:46.951 --> 00:48:49.470
like taking care of these places.

787
00:48:49.750 --> 00:48:52.010
<v 1>Well,
one of the things that preserve that would have been a,</v>

788
00:48:52.011 --> 00:48:55.970
there was a very strong superstition around a lot of these monuments and some of

789
00:48:55.971 --> 00:49:00.830
the monuments would have been known as a fairy forwards or and so on.

790
00:49:01.280 --> 00:49:05.180
And people thought,
you know,
you might get,
if you just start with one of them,

791
00:49:05.210 --> 00:49:08.450
you might get ill or Bob Lockwood come to you.

792
00:49:08.451 --> 00:49:10.760
And every single part of Ireland,

793
00:49:11.090 --> 00:49:13.430
there are many hundreds and hundreds of those stories,
you know.

794
00:49:13.670 --> 00:49:17.970
So they certainly protected the monuments for a long time.
Um,
you know,

795
00:49:17.980 --> 00:49:21.600
we have about 1,700,
uh,
uh,

796
00:49:21.800 --> 00:49:26.210
megalithic monuments in our,
but there may have been more originate to,
you know,

797
00:49:26.730 --> 00:49:29.780
um,
so some were certainly destroyed,
particularly the smaller ones,

798
00:49:30.110 --> 00:49:32.720
but something like this isn't,
isn't going to be destroyed too easily.

799
00:49:32.980 --> 00:49:33.741
I was just wondering,

800
00:49:33.741 --> 00:49:38.570
has there been any reason sane for the majority of the passage teams are spread

801
00:49:38.571 --> 00:49:40.070
across the northern half of the country?

802
00:49:40.071 --> 00:49:43.660
Or are the other types more evenly spread or is there anything reason for them

803
00:49:43.661 --> 00:49:48.050
to know?
And I would personally love to know the answer to Sasha.
And I tell you,

804
00:49:48.051 --> 00:49:52.250
I haven't even heard a good theory as regard that it is an unusual thing.

805
00:49:52.251 --> 00:49:56.030
There are some certainly to the south and evidence of passenger tradition as far

806
00:49:56.031 --> 00:50:00.020
as out as clear island and so on.
Of course.
Um,

807
00:50:00.890 --> 00:50:04.370
so there were there and Neolithic people were moving all over the island.

808
00:50:04.400 --> 00:50:09.230
No question.
But it is something of a puzzle,
you know,
that's be interesting.

809
00:50:12.500 --> 00:50:15.840
<v 5>Uh,
I have actually two questions.
One is,
uh,
uh,</v>

810
00:50:15.870 --> 00:50:19.650
related to Google and one is not related to Google.
So the one that's,
uh,

811
00:50:19.690 --> 00:50:23.060
I'll start with,
uh,
with the second one.
Uh,
you showed some of those tombs,

812
00:50:23.070 --> 00:50:27.770
they're relatively small,
right?
So just a few meters in diameter.
Uh,

813
00:50:27.800 --> 00:50:30.080
so how do you identify that this is actual aerial stuff?

814
00:50:30.081 --> 00:50:34.610
If I go and pick the old rocks and put them in place,
uh,

815
00:50:34.640 --> 00:50:39.520
would you,
like,
could you definitively say that this is a,
you know,
a new markup,

816
00:50:39.530 --> 00:50:43.820
they or a,
or an old thing that was used?

817
00:50:44.120 --> 00:50:46.310
That's question number one.
Question number two.

818
00:50:46.550 --> 00:50:51.550
Are you a or have anybody used Google maps imagery to identify the tombs?

819
00:50:52.900 --> 00:50:55.720
<v 1>Thanks.
Yeah.
Um,
as regards to the first question,</v>

820
00:50:55.721 --> 00:50:58.480
it is confusing because sometimes people have those,
how does this days,

821
00:50:58.481 --> 00:50:59.380
days and you know,

822
00:50:59.610 --> 00:51:03.090
they'll pull up a very big stone in the foundations and then maybe another and,

823
00:51:03.420 --> 00:51:07.280
and they five looks like a diamond.
Um,

824
00:51:07.281 --> 00:51:09.890
did they make a dull moment in their garden or something like that?

825
00:51:09.891 --> 00:51:14.500
And they can look,
you know,
very similar to answer monuments.
So of course,

826
00:51:14.501 --> 00:51:18.200
we can't take the stolen wait.
We date,
uh,

827
00:51:18.250 --> 00:51:21.070
items that are found within the monument.

828
00:51:21.160 --> 00:51:25.810
And that's what tells us is an authentic one.
Uh,
as well as that,
for many,

829
00:51:25.811 --> 00:51:27.280
many decades and generations,

830
00:51:27.281 --> 00:51:30.490
people have been recording these monuments so we know where all the real ones

831
00:51:30.491 --> 00:51:35.140
are,
more or less,
you know,
so that gets around that problem.
Um,
as regards,

832
00:51:35.230 --> 00:51:38.770
uh,
Google maps and so on.
Yeah,
absolutely.
And,
uh,
you know,

833
00:51:38.771 --> 00:51:43.690
I have colleagues who are up to two and three in the morning and I'll Google

834
00:51:43.691 --> 00:51:47.710
maps,
finding sites,
zooming in on things,
not getting any sleep,

835
00:51:47.770 --> 00:51:52.030
but it's very exciting.
So it's,
it's,
it's been an obstacle brilliant to,
uh,

836
00:51:52.090 --> 00:51:56.170
for finding new monuments or even just presenting information and showing people

837
00:51:56.171 --> 00:51:58.010
landscapes and so on.
Yeah.
Yeah.

838
00:51:58.310 --> 00:52:00.930
<v 3>Take good questions.
That's great.
Where you have,
we're almost at a time.</v>

839
00:52:01.140 --> 00:52:04.500
So just before we let you go,
uh,
Robert was explaining to me earlier,

840
00:52:04.530 --> 00:52:06.660
heard the name new ranges and to particularly exciting,

841
00:52:06.870 --> 00:52:08.640
but it has a far more beautiful name.

842
00:52:08.641 --> 00:52:12.420
Can you tell us about where blue boy or a [inaudible] and palace,

843
00:52:12.550 --> 00:52:16.080
the palace on the boy,
and then you tell our audience,
uh,
those names came from,

844
00:52:16.350 --> 00:52:17.700
it's just from the Irish language.

845
00:52:18.460 --> 00:52:22.610
<v 1>Uh,
so the Borneo comes from the boiling river,
which surrounds the whole complex.</v>

846
00:52:22.611 --> 00:52:25.340
And if there was no boiling river,
they'll probably would be no monuments.

847
00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:28.820
So demarcates it is a very special piece of land.

848
00:52:29.180 --> 00:52:32.510
It was associated with the [inaudible].
Um,

849
00:52:32.600 --> 00:52:36.250
and then the word brew is refers to a palace.

850
00:52:36.290 --> 00:52:40.890
Sometimes it's translated or sometimes as a hostile.
Um,
so,
uh,

851
00:52:40.980 --> 00:52:44.000
the hostile on the vine or the pilots on the vine as the proper name,

852
00:52:44.420 --> 00:52:49.000
and it's often associated with the Danish and Angus.
It was a young God.
Uh,

853
00:52:49.010 --> 00:52:51.950
I'm kind of a song,
God as well.
A very appropriately.

854
00:52:52.960 --> 00:52:54.820
<v 3>That's lovely.
That's a far,
far nicer name.</v>

855
00:52:54.970 --> 00:52:59.120
Thank you so much for your time and for your information on your,
appreciate it.

856
00:52:59.740 --> 00:53:00.573
Thank you.

857
00:53:04.440 --> 00:53:04.500
<v 0>Okay.</v>
