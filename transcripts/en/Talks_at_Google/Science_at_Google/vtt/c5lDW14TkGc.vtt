WEBVTT

1
00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:10.690
Thank you so much for joining us.
Um,

2
00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:14.020
it's not everyday you get to interview and astronauts and an astrophysicist.

3
00:00:14.021 --> 00:00:18.220
So I'm extremely thrilled.
I'm flattered to be here.
My name is Sarah.

4
00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:19.720
I had up campus over in all street,

5
00:00:19.721 --> 00:00:22.510
which is a space for entrepreneurs and I'm also the chair of women at.

6
00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:25.120
And this event is one of the last events we're holding.
You know,

7
00:00:25.121 --> 00:00:26.410
we hold talks a Google very often,

8
00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:29.770
but our theme this year for International Women's Day was pressed for progress.

9
00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:31.600
And you can interpret that in many ways.

10
00:00:31.601 --> 00:00:33.970
We choose to think of it as influencing inclusive culture,

11
00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:35.950
but also thinking about how we can live better lives.

12
00:00:35.951 --> 00:00:39.190
And I think we'd all agree that space and the promise it has is a massive part

13
00:00:39.191 --> 00:00:43.400
of that.
So I'm really thrilled to welcome our two wonderful guests.
Um,

14
00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:45.350
they have really impressive biographies,

15
00:00:45.351 --> 00:00:47.950
so forgive me for looking at my paper at the same time.
Um,

16
00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:51.250
first things first at [inaudible],
a French doctor,

17
00:00:51.251 --> 00:00:54.320
politician and former astronauts with the Sontra last year and I'll do two

18
00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.110
special and the European Space Agency.
Um,
you studied,
uh,
medicine,

19
00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:03.340
biology,
sports medicine,
aviation space,
medicine,
rheumatology,
um,

20
00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:06.790
you've also got a phd in neuroscience,
incredible academic background.

21
00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:11.480
You were a backup crew member for the 1993 near Altair mission and um,

22
00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:16.030
in 2001 became the first European woman to visit the ISS following your career

23
00:01:16.031 --> 00:01:16.580
as an astronaut,

24
00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:20.080
you're into French politics as the minister for research and new technologies

25
00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.560
and you're a commander of the Legion of honor.
So welcome flooding.

26
00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:31.870
Um,
Ana Silvia Votto is an astrophysicist.

27
00:01:31.871 --> 00:01:34.440
He's been working at the European Space Agency since 1991.

28
00:01:34.441 --> 00:01:37.520
She's is currently chief diversity officer.
During her career at the essay,

29
00:01:37.521 --> 00:01:40.390
she's held several positions including elaboration of high level strategy,

30
00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:44.470
formulation of policies,
international relations,
strategic analysis,

31
00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:46.900
relations with member states and networks with think tanks.

32
00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:49.690
She has a specialization in astrophysics,
astrophysics,

33
00:01:49.691 --> 00:01:52.960
and a further education at economics.
So welcome.
I said Aaliyah.

34
00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.600
Um,

35
00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.600
so [inaudible] like many of us in the audience I grew up dreaming of going into

36
00:02:01.601 --> 00:02:06.280
space.
Um,
and you have this incredible academic record.
What made you,
you know,

37
00:02:06.281 --> 00:02:09.280
after getting a phd in neuroscience,
what made you become an astronaut?

38
00:02:09.281 --> 00:02:12.660
What was the original idea behind it?
Okay,
thanks very much.

39
00:02:12.661 --> 00:02:14.960
I'm really happy to be with you today.
Uh,

40
00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:20.040
it's not really the story from the Phd in neuroscience to become an astronaut.

41
00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:25.420
I will begin with the flux at ty was 12 in July 69 for the first human landing

42
00:02:27.421 --> 00:02:29.130
on the moon.
And it was really for me,

43
00:02:29.131 --> 00:02:34.131
something incredible over to as this dream and accessible becoming your reality.

44
00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:39.590
And at that time it was for me some things that fed my imagination.

45
00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:45.780
I read a lot of documentaries,
science fiction books and uh,
everything.
Um,

46
00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:50.640
as there is no,
as soon as cool,
it's not the curriculum,

47
00:02:50.641 --> 00:02:52.590
the two you can until like that.

48
00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:55.830
But I decided to become a medical doctor.

49
00:02:55.831 --> 00:03:00.831
I'm a rheumatologist and I had just in the hospital where I was working in,

50
00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:03.280
in package to discover a call,

51
00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:08.580
an opportunity from the French agency to become an astronaut and taking part in

52
00:03:09.821 --> 00:03:13.270
the century programs in the space station.
So for me,

53
00:03:13.271 --> 00:03:17.560
it was clear it was for me and I tried it and ask her file and I did my,

54
00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:22.030
put my candidature and goes through the selection and I've been selected.

55
00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:27.360
It was in 85 and maybe some things that I can share more with the girls,

56
00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:30.310
isn't it?
With boys.

57
00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:35.710
I decided having been selected as an Sam Dittrich astronaut.

58
00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:41.530
Okay.
I had a doctorate and I was an MD.
I did clinical research,

59
00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:46.770
but I wanted to be sure that I will have all the right assets to be on the past

60
00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:53.680
in between astronaut candidates to astronauts assigned to a mission.

61
00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:58.710
So I decided to do a phd in order to work in a laboratory.

62
00:03:59.171 --> 00:04:03.310
And to have really is,
it's a basic training as a scientist.

63
00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:08.670
And so I would say that it's maybe a kind of a lack of confidence that

64
00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:18.270
it was needed for me to have more than just was the first background in order to

65
00:04:19.241 --> 00:04:22.600
ensure that I will get to all the assets to be,
to be on the past.

66
00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:27.870
And it was wonderful to work in this laboratory for neuroscience because,
uh,

67
00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:33.300
I choose the right laboratory in order to be in the team cooperating on space

68
00:04:33.941 --> 00:04:38.440
program in micro gravity function in your body,
working with NASA,

69
00:04:38.441 --> 00:04:41.230
with Jaxa Japanese agency or the Russian agency.

70
00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:46.090
So that meant it was one element to be sure to be somewhere on the right path

71
00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:51.130
after that.
And it was obvious for me that I had to try it.

72
00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:56.200
And uh,
as I said after that,

73
00:04:56.230 --> 00:05:00.130
a long time training because I had been separated in [inaudible] 85 and my first

74
00:05:00.131 --> 00:05:05.131
flight was in 96 so long training in order to become not just the scientists but

75
00:05:06.161 --> 00:05:07.270
also an engineer.

76
00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:12.630
My first ride was as a scientist astronaut and my second plans as an boat

77
00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:17.080
engine,
yours at men in charge of everything maintenance,

78
00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:20.590
um,
of the,
the station and there was a vacancy.

79
00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:24.550
So a long period of training and uh,
greet,

80
00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:26.680
impatience to,

81
00:05:26.681 --> 00:05:30.310
to visit day in August [inaudible] 96,
uh,

82
00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:32.960
waiting for the surgery guy friends.

83
00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:39.050
It's a beginning of the adventure and a really the adventures reality.

84
00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:44.190
What's even more wonderful than the dream I had in mind and my imagination.

85
00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:49.200
I'm very lucky.
I have to ask you more about about the reality.
I'm,

86
00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:52.990
I mean I'm good at,
you know,
10 year training period to me is a staggering,

87
00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:54.460
can you tell us more about like,

88
00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:57.380
is there a particular moment that for you is simply unforgettable about your

89
00:05:57.381 --> 00:06:00.200
first trip into space?
Just a moment that made you think,
wow,

90
00:06:00.201 --> 00:06:02.120
this is worth this 10 year journey.

91
00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:06.080
Whoa,
at this time.

92
00:06:06.081 --> 00:06:11.081
But I would like also to say is that with the time as I explained Ali for 10

93
00:06:11.751 --> 00:06:15.920
years in Russia because my two flights,
where is there a,

94
00:06:15.921 --> 00:06:20.921
so your system and that mean there is a very wow moment during the flight,

95
00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:27.590
the are so own moment with this period of life in star city in Russia.

96
00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:33.130
I went there in [inaudible] 92 just at the beginning of the Russian period after

97
00:06:33.651 --> 00:06:38.651
the Soviet Union and I saw oh to transformation and this was also cultural shock

98
00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:43.810
and it was something really impressive.
And uh,

99
00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:50.110
that means that we have wonderful and unexpected moments for the mission.

100
00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:54.870
But I have a short mission,
a space mission,
but their research,

101
00:06:54.890 --> 00:06:59.890
there was this incredible human adventure that I left for 10 years with my

102
00:07:00.021 --> 00:07:04.160
colleagues with different culture,
diversity of gender,

103
00:07:04.161 --> 00:07:09.161
diversity of backgrounds with the military pilots are as well as a scientist and

104
00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:11.140
even,
uh,

105
00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:15.680
tourist space stories at the time so that we have all the landscape where

106
00:07:15.681 --> 00:07:20.600
there's a spectrum and for the flight,
what can I say,

107
00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:25.730
uh,
as a rheumatologist and as a sport women,
I'm a gymnast.

108
00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:31.180
I was really impressed with the new abilities I discovered being in free

109
00:07:31.281 --> 00:07:36.070
floating,
but I can try to share a little ritual,

110
00:07:36.071 --> 00:07:38.570
has senior pictures and movies about that.

111
00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:43.190
And that's really exciting to see that we have some hidden,

112
00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:48.170
I would say,
abilities that will be revealed in this new environment.

113
00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:52.700
And this is this feeling of,
um,
freedom,

114
00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:58.270
not completely comfortable at the very beginning because you have to build new

115
00:07:58.431 --> 00:08:02.480
reference,
new frameworks.
And,
uh,
there is this,
uh,

116
00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:07.280
a way to reorganize your sensory motor patterns,

117
00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:12.640
but also to rebuild some cognitive references.

118
00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:14.180
And,
uh,
for example,

119
00:08:14.181 --> 00:08:18.970
the first time I looked through the window at this kind of visions that you have

120
00:08:18.971 --> 00:08:21.380
on screen that men earth,

121
00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:26.330
whereas above the customers or the sky.

122
00:08:26.690 --> 00:08:28.820
So I we're not comfortable with that.

123
00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:34.000
I had to do around the window in order to put everything on the right direction.

124
00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:38.420
And the same to see Africa above Spain for example.

125
00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:43.630
It was not comfortable for me also while to actively to community rotation in

126
00:08:44.541 --> 00:08:49.340
order to,
to to be quite so this um,
ability,

127
00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:53.220
uh,
potential for adaptation of hours,

128
00:08:53.230 --> 00:08:55.450
sensory maturer sensors and the,

129
00:08:55.451 --> 00:09:00.451
and the way this is really something incredible and Zinzi glance through the

130
00:09:01.861 --> 00:09:04.290
window.
That's true too.

131
00:09:04.730 --> 00:09:09.730
To have this chance to be in orbit and 400 kilometers from Earth as you know,

132
00:09:10.021 --> 00:09:11.820
one orbit is 90 minutes.

133
00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:16.910
So that means 16 times a day we have the flexibility to go through depending of

134
00:09:17.341 --> 00:09:20.970
the kind of orbit,
if you're in there a bit with the Pacific for example,

135
00:09:21.270 --> 00:09:24.480
it will be 50 minutes,
water,
water,
water,

136
00:09:24.481 --> 00:09:28.100
water and the saint to see some of that.

137
00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:32.690
So that's really,
yeah,

138
00:09:32.790 --> 00:09:37.510
we are very privileged.
I think we are about 580.
Yeah.

139
00:09:37.890 --> 00:09:42.390
Astronauts,
the small group,
just 10% female as,
wow.

140
00:09:42.390 --> 00:09:45.150
I didn't realize it was the same person that came in about 60.

141
00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:50.080
We can discuss that after of course,
10% applicants.

142
00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:55.020
Candidates that means Oh,
interesting.
Yes.
Then 10%

143
00:09:56.910 --> 00:09:58.850
10% perhaps similar as Renault's.

144
00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:03.600
So that's the entry of the pipe and sees the reason they're fits it.

145
00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:06.510
Yeah.
That's really interesting.

146
00:10:06.630 --> 00:10:09.780
I really liked your point around we have abilities will be revealed in space.

147
00:10:09.790 --> 00:10:14.520
Right.
That sounds wonderful.
Mystical.
Um,
and also,
you know,

148
00:10:14.521 --> 00:10:16.380
from everything we've read about eight 10 picks,

149
00:10:16.381 --> 00:10:19.050
diaries have helped a lot of us get a stronger picture of what it feels like

150
00:10:19.051 --> 00:10:19.884
they are today.

151
00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:23.380
How did the two journeys change your thinking when you came back to us?

152
00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:25.800
How did you,
was anything that felt different?

153
00:10:25.801 --> 00:10:28.080
I mean obviously we've all seen this story this week about Scott's Kalyan does

154
00:10:28.081 --> 00:10:29.550
twin,
um,
you know,

155
00:10:29.551 --> 00:10:32.190
we knew very little about that right now apart from the fact that 70% of his

156
00:10:32.191 --> 00:10:36.400
jeans and are an identical identical twin.
But what in your thought processes,

157
00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:41.310
what felt different when you came back?
I had short duration missions.

158
00:10:41.311 --> 00:10:45.510
The first one was a 16 days mission and the second one in 10 days mission.

159
00:10:45.511 --> 00:10:50.511
So nursing seem to see with Tim pig mission six months duration or a Scott

160
00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:54.440
Kelly,
as you said,
one more one year,
uh,
mission.

161
00:10:54.970 --> 00:10:59.970
And personally I've been surprised by the quick adaptation coming back.

162
00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:07.230
So in a few sagon you have to use a gain your exterior reception and

163
00:11:07.231 --> 00:11:09.570
proprioception in Europe,
uh,

164
00:11:09.770 --> 00:11:14.770
Kim and sensors in their joints and also your vestibular characters in order to

165
00:11:15.430 --> 00:11:19.110
cope with Patina less than two minutes.
You are okay.

166
00:11:19.270 --> 00:11:20.970
Was that the first night?

167
00:11:21.060 --> 00:11:26.060
It was a little bit strange because I had the feeling awake during the night

168
00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:34.700
because my body was heavy weighting and all the objects that I had on my body

169
00:11:37.501 --> 00:11:42.000
for monetary,
my physical state with the sensors,

170
00:11:42.250 --> 00:11:46.620
everything was
floating in the room.

171
00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:50.070
So I was always,
we can,
in order to put every senior on the,

172
00:11:50.071 --> 00:11:50.881
on the same way though.

173
00:11:50.881 --> 00:11:55.881
So there was a gap in between my personal feeling of coming back home and my

174
00:11:56.770 --> 00:11:58.870
intellectual Roi.
Um,

175
00:11:59.770 --> 00:12:03.810
cognitive feeling is that I was too in micro gravity,

176
00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:08.770
but it's,
um,
so it's not at all the same for long duration.
Mission as you know,

177
00:12:08.771 --> 00:12:13.771
is a resistor adaptation in micro gravity with the muscle relaxants that men and

178
00:12:14.321 --> 00:12:15.670
muscular atrophy,

179
00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:19.990
a demeanor realization for the bone structure.

180
00:12:20.290 --> 00:12:24.620
So is that means it's a little bit a long process to,
to,

181
00:12:24.790 --> 00:12:26.830
to go into the rehabilitation.

182
00:12:26.940 --> 00:12:31.940
It's not a question of minutes to question few weeks and months in order to,

183
00:12:33.790 --> 00:12:36.470
to be completely back to your style.

184
00:12:36.910 --> 00:12:41.910
So I've seen already this paper about this difference in the gene sequences.

185
00:12:42.310 --> 00:12:46.030
Uh,
and uh,
so it's,
it's a challenging question.

186
00:12:46.570 --> 00:12:48.350
We know that there is radiation,

187
00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:53.360
there is stress that can change something in their gene expression.

188
00:12:54.730 --> 00:12:58.570
So we have to way to resolve it to,
to know more.
And what is difficult or,

189
00:12:58.571 --> 00:13:02.530
so in this field of micro gravity,
for example,
I've always the question,

190
00:13:02.770 --> 00:13:05.920
but what is the difference is a metabolism between the female astronauts

191
00:13:06.970 --> 00:13:10.660
astronauts during a long duration flight.
Um,
as you know,

192
00:13:10.661 --> 00:13:15.580
as a researchers in order to,
to get,
um,
uh,
certain,

193
00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:20.200
I'm sure you need to have some cases and we have so few cases,

194
00:13:20.201 --> 00:13:24.260
a female astronaut for long division pledge that it's difficult to say really

195
00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:28.740
syncing and the same for this,
uh,
potential,
uh,

196
00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:32.680
gene description.
We know that the reason normally after the flight,

197
00:13:32.710 --> 00:13:37.580
but the fact of the Canada,
yeah,
we're lucky he's got,
it's been really bad.

198
00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:42.170
I,
Sylvia,
you kind of,
um,
you know,
you've been working at the SAS,

199
00:13:42.171 --> 00:13:45.160
it's notion it one,
obviously your background is in astrophysics.

200
00:13:45.161 --> 00:13:47.320
My lucky number about how you came to space as well.

201
00:13:47.620 --> 00:13:50.380
Was it a dream of yours when you were a child?
Um,

202
00:13:50.530 --> 00:13:52.510
I know you've done so many roles in your time at the agency,

203
00:13:52.511 --> 00:13:55.120
but how have you seen the agency evolve in that time?
Yes.

204
00:13:56.410 --> 00:13:59.500
<v 2>Oh,
I,
first of all,
I had to say when I was a teenager,</v>

205
00:13:59.501 --> 00:14:02.040
I was very tortured teenager,

206
00:14:02.050 --> 00:14:06.490
very much into the poetry literature and they really needed something.

207
00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:11.350
I wanted to study something that was able to take my center of gravity outside

208
00:14:11.351 --> 00:14:13.960
myself.
It putting distance from myself.

209
00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:17.720
I wanted to feel this sense of freedom,
even the sun.

210
00:14:17.721 --> 00:14:22.630
So being nothing in an in an indifferent,
silent universe was,

211
00:14:22.631 --> 00:14:26.320
was for me,
very empowering.
And I have to say,

212
00:14:26.321 --> 00:14:31.321
I actually something that now in my job as diversity officer often say to girls,

213
00:14:32.530 --> 00:14:37.060
there is a power of transformations by studying physics in particular,

214
00:14:37.630 --> 00:14:41.980
uh,
that is forever.
And this is because you have a,
um,

215
00:14:42.580 --> 00:14:43.480
uh,
we have,

216
00:14:43.810 --> 00:14:48.180
you have to abandon your experience to understand and,

217
00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:52.160
and you enter it in a different world.
Just give an example.
Uh,

218
00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:57.670
you have 40 cents that the helium superfluid helium superfood is a magic think.

219
00:14:57.890 --> 00:15:01.670
And if you go below a certain temperature,
he lose the third dimension.

220
00:15:01.730 --> 00:15:06.560
It becomes flat.
So if you put in a glass,
you start climbing and goes,

221
00:15:06.620 --> 00:15:11.270
I mean,
as a feel of a table.
Now this looks magic.
Uh,

222
00:15:11.271 --> 00:15:15.530
it's something that you never experienced normally,
but it's through his physics.

223
00:15:15.950 --> 00:15:19.160
And the same for,
for,
for what concerns space.

224
00:15:19.161 --> 00:15:24.161
And I was actually studying general relativity and the fact that time fields

225
00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:30.200
spit.
So change with speed and change with gravity.

226
00:15:30.201 --> 00:15:33.170
So the time that we feel here is not,

227
00:15:33.650 --> 00:15:38.450
doesn't go the same pace then on the space station and even further.

228
00:15:38.451 --> 00:15:42.110
So all these things that looks again,

229
00:15:42.111 --> 00:15:46.430
fiction are actually other laws of physic,
uh,
that are valuable.

230
00:15:46.431 --> 00:15:50.390
And this put me in a dimension of,
or really feeling a sense of,
uh,

231
00:15:51.050 --> 00:15:55.370
of a power as a human being,
a power of,
uh,
being,

232
00:15:55.371 --> 00:16:00.220
uh,
the one that can ask questions and feel quarters.
Uh,

233
00:16:00.470 --> 00:16:04.940
which by the way,
is the,
that also Steven Stephen King passed very strongly,

234
00:16:05.150 --> 00:16:10.040
uh,
all through his life that,
uh,
Debbie,
do you ask questions is,
um,

235
00:16:10.670 --> 00:16:15.260
is what makes the difference in this,
in this universe?
Um,

236
00:16:15.380 --> 00:16:19.730
I've been with the European space white space space because again,

237
00:16:19.780 --> 00:16:22.440
is it's a natural,
uh,

238
00:16:22.580 --> 00:16:26.860
if you want to wear when you have this kind of,
uh,
of desire.

239
00:16:26.870 --> 00:16:30.980
Actually desire is a,
is a,
is a,
is a very important award for me.

240
00:16:30.981 --> 00:16:35.981
You're not desire Desiderio comes from the late in the [inaudible] s be far from

241
00:16:36.411 --> 00:16:39.370
the stars.
So I act.

242
00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.470
So I really believe that in each of us,

243
00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:45.740
there is this tension to reach out to something bigger than us,

244
00:16:45.980 --> 00:16:50.690
to something we want to,
we want to join,
we don't want to join back.

245
00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:56.020
And,
uh,
it's a big driver and they felt this drive.
I needed this,

246
00:16:56.030 --> 00:16:59.050
a spiritual demands,
the national,
you said,
sad.

247
00:16:59.230 --> 00:17:03.980
And in listening to crowded this mystic dimension,
uh,
and so,
uh,

248
00:17:03.981 --> 00:17:08.480
the Europeans facility also because of his international,
uh,

249
00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:12.080
feature was really the perfect place to be.

250
00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:15.770
I've also spent four years in Washington DC working a,

251
00:17:15.771 --> 00:17:19.650
and the relations with Naza,
which added up another dimensional.

252
00:17:19.660 --> 00:17:24.440
So not just the European model,
so to see from the other side.
And,
uh,

253
00:17:24.470 --> 00:17:28.510
I,
and this is what I try now to pass also these,
uh,

254
00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:31.380
the amazement,
the wondering of a,

255
00:17:31.390 --> 00:17:34.790
of what we discover it we had the gravitational waves,

256
00:17:35.180 --> 00:17:38.150
just this covert,
uh,

257
00:17:38.210 --> 00:17:42.450
last year is big turning point where so many mysteries,

258
00:17:42.451 --> 00:17:47.450
so still to solve.
And it's really a,
I mean,
this is the sense for me of,
uh,

259
00:17:47.451 --> 00:17:50.970
of being,
uh,
mind and heart in,
in this

260
00:17:52.510 --> 00:17:55.530
<v 0>bust university.
Yeah,
I love it.
Um,</v>

261
00:17:56.080 --> 00:17:57.700
so we were really lucky last year in London.

262
00:17:57.701 --> 00:18:01.870
We had an amazing exhibit at the Science Museum about the Russian race for Space

263
00:18:01.870 --> 00:18:03.040
Star said he was a massive feature of it.

264
00:18:03.041 --> 00:18:07.410
I don't know if anybody else went to it.
Um,
but yeah,
it was great.
Right.
Um,

265
00:18:07.540 --> 00:18:11.200
and anybody who's my age challenger for me was a massive moment in my childhood.

266
00:18:11.201 --> 00:18:14.670
I think the first time as a child that I was ever understood disappointment and

267
00:18:14.671 --> 00:18:17.100
failure and you know,
that that could have immediate pain.

268
00:18:17.110 --> 00:18:19.750
Think a lot of kids followed that very closely.
Um,

269
00:18:20.290 --> 00:18:24.160
and it kind of struck me at the Russian exhibit that that seemed like such a

270
00:18:24.161 --> 00:18:28.330
golden age in terms of space.
And I'd love to get your thoughts on,
you know,

271
00:18:28.510 --> 00:18:31.100
obviously with the Scott Kelly's story in the last year we've seen Tim Peake can

272
00:18:31.101 --> 00:18:33.140
make the most of media.
Um,

273
00:18:33.250 --> 00:18:36.130
but it feels like a very different era in terms of space and are designed to

274
00:18:36.131 --> 00:18:38.770
explore space.
Do you think that's fair?
Like what do you think about the,

275
00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:43.590
the shifting politics of space over time?
You can

276
00:18:45.570 --> 00:18:47.030
generally,
as should is a

277
00:18:47.030 --> 00:18:51.490
<v 2>perception.
Today we have a globally.
So on the institutional side,</v>

278
00:18:51.491 --> 00:18:55.970
we have modern 70 billions that are funded,
uh,

279
00:18:56.260 --> 00:19:01.010
spent in a space activity,
see space activities.
We have,
uh,

280
00:19:01.060 --> 00:19:05.920
uh,
the babble of actors so well beyond the usual suspects.

281
00:19:05.921 --> 00:19:09.290
So now we have about 75,
uh,

282
00:19:09.490 --> 00:19:13.780
countries that spanned invest more than 10 million in space.
Uh,

283
00:19:13.781 --> 00:19:18.781
so it's really a large bank and in a way you see that it's not just the

284
00:19:18.791 --> 00:19:19.624
economic,

285
00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:25.900
the economic interest because actually for this 70 millions spent,

286
00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:30.100
you have a downstream activity that is a factor of five out of that.

287
00:19:30.910 --> 00:19:34.540
But there is this a,
again,
this tension,

288
00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:36.880
this desire of prestige in a way.

289
00:19:36.881 --> 00:19:41.230
I think that apart from sports that really makes achievements,

290
00:19:41.770 --> 00:19:44.470
uh,
known to everyone,

291
00:19:44.471 --> 00:19:49.471
to humanity is only space activities going really give this status and this

292
00:19:50.161 --> 00:19:51.880
statement.
And of course the results.

293
00:19:51.881 --> 00:19:54.550
So the fact that the space infrastructure is,
uh,

294
00:19:54.940 --> 00:19:59.530
is something that now is part of our daily life.
Uh,

295
00:19:59.620 --> 00:20:04.390
and you know,
also in terms of exploration,
if you take us,

296
00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:09.300
Japan,
Russia,
Europe,
South Korea,
India,

297
00:20:09.310 --> 00:20:11.260
China,
uh,

298
00:20:11.650 --> 00:20:16.510
in a five year style we have about 15 missions,
uh,

299
00:20:16.540 --> 00:20:21.370
mono oriented,
similar number,
Matt,
uh,
driven.

300
00:20:21.371 --> 00:20:25.100
And then the asterisk there,
the planets.
So there is a,

301
00:20:25.210 --> 00:20:29.170
there is a big activities.
The problem is the,
of course,

302
00:20:29.171 --> 00:20:32.230
what was the time being really pioneering.

303
00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:37.560
But there is still elements of pioneer rank coming in particular now also from

304
00:20:38.291 --> 00:20:42.880
the private sector.
So I think the dynamic is really is really,

305
00:20:42.881 --> 00:20:46.870
there is not a,
it's not a loss interest.
And also astronauts,

306
00:20:47.050 --> 00:20:48.100
we see us for notes,

307
00:20:48.670 --> 00:20:53.150
<v 0>the twitters and the media coverage.
Yeah.
Yes,
for sure.
And the,</v>

308
00:20:53.151 --> 00:20:58.151
you have been in a right place to see the way Tim Peake communicate with a

309
00:20:58.480 --> 00:21:01.330
Instagram,
Twitter and a,

310
00:21:01.331 --> 00:21:05.860
it's really interesting to share immediately is this,
uh,
adventure.

311
00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:10.910
Uh,
yes,
that's true.
That there is a new era for,

312
00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:12.070
for space.
And uh,

313
00:21:12.460 --> 00:21:16.480
you evoked also those are private companies that are involved now and are

314
00:21:16.481 --> 00:21:20.800
challenging our way to,
to think and to organize.

315
00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:26.070
And I have a dream.
And this,
uh,
the concept I'm working on,
uh,

316
00:21:26.180 --> 00:21:27.880
in the European Space Agency,

317
00:21:28.510 --> 00:21:31.840
this concept to about specific oration,

318
00:21:31.930 --> 00:21:36.930
human space exploration to enlarge this concept of exploration to the one of

319
00:21:37.630 --> 00:21:42.500
expansion of our humanity on a no,
the surveys,

320
00:21:42.510 --> 00:21:46.180
the moon surface and um,

321
00:21:46.210 --> 00:21:50.190
working on a moon village concept set,

322
00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:55.200
male building a permanent infrastructure with a robotic and then permanent

323
00:21:57.941 --> 00:22:02.530
infrastructure where we will live and work in a bit.

324
00:22:03.780 --> 00:22:04.810
And that means for me,

325
00:22:04.811 --> 00:22:09.811
it's an interesting concept because we need to think in germs of new landscape

326
00:22:10.870 --> 00:22:12.670
out of the books,
out of the atmosphere,

327
00:22:13.270 --> 00:22:16.510
new partners on the Internet side,

328
00:22:16.750 --> 00:22:21.630
you said the international space station with five partners and we will have a

329
00:22:21.650 --> 00:22:24.520
Chinese speciation in a few months from now,

330
00:22:25.080 --> 00:22:28.570
but with different interests in different way to cooperate.

331
00:22:29.620 --> 00:22:31.450
And we have to think this

332
00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:38.280
village that men live together for the future of humanity in a,

333
00:22:39.091 --> 00:22:44.091
in a new environment with private interest mining for example,

334
00:22:45.851 --> 00:22:50.500
to exploit some resources,
tourism,
um,

335
00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:55.270
cultural,
uh,
and industries and energy,

336
00:22:55.300 --> 00:22:57.820
building a new materials,

337
00:22:57.821 --> 00:23:00.820
a lot of economic expansion.

338
00:23:00.821 --> 00:23:05.810
Also in term of economics and economic in the surrounding of the earth economy,

339
00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:08.710
et cetera and so low earth orbit economy,

340
00:23:09.490 --> 00:23:11.500
the space station for example,

341
00:23:11.770 --> 00:23:14.830
we decided to um,

342
00:23:14.890 --> 00:23:19.660
to be in this exploitation of the space station with his partners and the Public

343
00:23:19.660 --> 00:23:24.660
Institution until 2024 maybe 2028 and then to begin to think in terms of

344
00:23:28.301 --> 00:23:31.210
commercial expectation of the low earth orbit,
but whoever's,

345
00:23:31.220 --> 00:23:36.220
so to think in terms of this expansion and expanding the economical sphere,

346
00:23:36.520 --> 00:23:39.730
I would say a four earth.
So that's been,

347
00:23:39.731 --> 00:23:44.260
that's really an interesting concept in order to racing ever sing in terms of

348
00:23:44.261 --> 00:23:46.640
governments,
interfaces,
partners,

349
00:23:46.641 --> 00:23:50.040
that's it will be powered kind of activities that would be there.

350
00:23:50.050 --> 00:23:51.720
The scientific one on the far side,

351
00:23:51.721 --> 00:23:56.240
those a moon or a lot of the science as we can do as the moon and from the moon,

352
00:23:56.730 --> 00:23:58.310
a technological developments,

353
00:23:59.130 --> 00:24:04.130
Roberta advanced robotics and interaction with her and this is very exciting to

354
00:24:05.811 --> 00:24:09.600
try to reconsider in order to,

355
00:24:09.660 --> 00:24:14.660
to be actively involved in changes and not just passive too.

356
00:24:16.670 --> 00:24:17.270
Yes,

357
00:24:17.270 --> 00:24:21.450
that's even receiving the tenders by the new actors and you are going to make

358
00:24:21.451 --> 00:24:22.610
that.
So yeah.

359
00:24:22.940 --> 00:24:27.940
So I think we need such visions in order to be really active and to design the

360
00:24:30.621 --> 00:24:34.680
future.
We wish.
Yeah,
I like that very much.
What are the,
um,

361
00:24:35.350 --> 00:24:38.760
what are the timelines?
Is something like [inaudible] village?
I mean,
I think,
um,

362
00:24:39.290 --> 00:24:40.880
many of us have long burning cited by the,

363
00:24:40.950 --> 00:24:42.710
the idea of how to go into space as a tourist,

364
00:24:42.711 --> 00:24:45.220
but I love the idea of building a new world,

365
00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:49.550
kind of testing out an infrastructure that is nation less in some ways on the

366
00:24:49.550 --> 00:24:51.560
moon.
What would be,
what kind of timelines for a project like that?

367
00:24:51.970 --> 00:24:52.791
And I'm guessing this kind of thing,

368
00:24:52.791 --> 00:24:57.320
it's very long term I would say begins already because there is some,
uh,
some,
uh,

369
00:24:57.380 --> 00:25:00.680
probes around,
uh,
the moons.

370
00:25:00.681 --> 00:25:05.030
There will be soon a new probes from the Chinese side on the far side of the

371
00:25:05.031 --> 00:25:09.620
moon and Mars sample return and the Indian one and the Japanese one.

372
00:25:09.980 --> 00:25:14.980
So that been them robotic elements in order to make some maps,

373
00:25:16.630 --> 00:25:18.110
uh,
defining your,

374
00:25:18.111 --> 00:25:23.111
so where are some resources that we will have to use because if you are building

375
00:25:24.141 --> 00:25:26.600
something and the surface of the moon,

376
00:25:26.660 --> 00:25:30.860
you will try to do with the in situ resource utilization.

377
00:25:30.861 --> 00:25:34.440
So that means we have to to make the map of it disabilities.

378
00:25:34.730 --> 00:25:39.730
So this is already the way for the first crew.

379
00:25:40.220 --> 00:25:42.290
Uh,
I would say that's a,

380
00:25:42.500 --> 00:25:46.520
if really we decided to go in 2030,

381
00:25:46.521 --> 00:25:50.760
for me it's something that can be achievable.
We have been already,
uh,

382
00:25:51.140 --> 00:25:54.170
with six mission say Apollo period on the,
on the moon.

383
00:25:54.171 --> 00:25:59.171
So for sure the techniques that jammed and as a result lots of a new element to,

384
00:26:00.460 --> 00:26:02.420
to secure in order to it.

385
00:26:02.750 --> 00:26:07.750
And there is also two to secure this sustainability because I'm speaking not so

386
00:26:08.721 --> 00:26:12.440
much in term of exploration with short period of visits,

387
00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:17.800
but living and working in the surface and sets men sustainability as well as the

388
00:26:17.811 --> 00:26:22.700
economic,
our sustainability,
sustainability for our living in there.

389
00:26:23.300 --> 00:26:27.920
But for the first group and I hope a crew with a female astronaut and not just

390
00:26:27.921 --> 00:26:32.300
men restaurant because there was 12 men on the moon,

391
00:26:33.030 --> 00:26:37.010
uh,
means there's 20 survey twenties.
Yeah,

392
00:26:37.550 --> 00:26:39.790
it can be something achievable.
How does,
um,

393
00:26:40.090 --> 00:26:43.700
I'm going to pick up back up on this piece around no woman on the,
um,

394
00:26:44.940 --> 00:26:45.990
<v 2>but I want to start with,
you know,</v>

395
00:26:45.991 --> 00:26:49.890
the two of them as well known figures right now and the race to space Richard

396
00:26:49.890 --> 00:26:53.700
Branson,
Elon Musk.
How does public and private interrelate in this world?
I mean,

397
00:26:53.701 --> 00:26:57.240
do public figures like that,
setting these very audacious goals,

398
00:26:57.780 --> 00:27:01.050
does that help this mission of if the goal is to raise perception and
excitement,

399
00:27:01.051 --> 00:27:03.900
trans space for the next generation of kids to become astronauts?
Sure.

400
00:27:04.310 --> 00:27:08.790
I have to say that actually what you bring also from what [inaudible] was saying

401
00:27:08.791 --> 00:27:12.780
is that we are in a moment of many paradigm shifts.

402
00:27:12.870 --> 00:27:17.870
So we have four server actually this move from being explorers to start thinking

403
00:27:20.311 --> 00:27:24.030
on being also settlers,
which is,
which is something new.

404
00:27:24.031 --> 00:27:26.640
I mean was not this the,
the,

405
00:27:26.641 --> 00:27:30.930
the project at the time with just going that and come back.
So there is,

406
00:27:30.980 --> 00:27:34.590
there are two venues that opened up,
uh,
at the same time,

407
00:27:34.591 --> 00:27:37.710
the paradigm shifts actually to have this new,

408
00:27:37.740 --> 00:27:41.990
what we call the [inaudible] nurse coming in.
Uh,

409
00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:46.650
and the entrepreneurs coming in actually driven by two,
two things on one side.

410
00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:50.770
Of course,
the gold rush as it's called in the,
in the US,

411
00:27:50.820 --> 00:27:55.710
because you have unchartered territories to the score at the same time.
I mean,

412
00:27:55.711 --> 00:27:59.140
there is a,
uh,
infrastructure,
uh,
that,
uh,

413
00:27:59.470 --> 00:28:03.420
I mean is needed for the booming economy or the digital ago for the booming

414
00:28:03.421 --> 00:28:07.530
market or the digital economy.
So is there,
is this,
uh,

415
00:28:07.790 --> 00:28:12.350
attraction from,
from the business,
but also the fact that in a way you,
you,

416
00:28:12.351 --> 00:28:17.330
you can see a race between the billionaires,
uh,
and,

417
00:28:17.350 --> 00:28:19.230
uh,
and even with their project,
you know,

418
00:28:19.231 --> 00:28:23.120
Elon Musk with this project of colonizing a,

419
00:28:23.260 --> 00:28:25.030
the solar system with,
uh,

420
00:28:25.090 --> 00:28:30.090
with humanities is one of the most daring and ambitions adventure that in a way

421
00:28:30.601 --> 00:28:35.130
we,
we had put on the table.
And of course,
um,
and the same,

422
00:28:35.131 --> 00:28:38.830
the project for Branson,
a from,
uh,
uh,
from Basil's.
So,

423
00:28:38.831 --> 00:28:41.100
so there is really now a,

424
00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:45.420
sometimes in a provocative way I say that what was before the race between

425
00:28:45.421 --> 00:28:49.590
nation now is race between [inaudible] this,
uh,
this,
uh,

426
00:28:50.220 --> 00:28:53.010
billionaires,
but all this is a,

427
00:28:53.011 --> 00:28:56.670
is good for space because it changed.
They have,
okay,

428
00:28:56.671 --> 00:28:59.490
they have of course the weight to,
uh,

429
00:28:59.940 --> 00:29:04.460
to challenge the institution and to make,
it's changing.
Uh,

430
00:29:04.470 --> 00:29:08.850
the U has with the under Obama was preparing for this,
uh,
for the,

431
00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:13.470
for the condition of having this expansion of the economic sphere to low earth

432
00:29:13.500 --> 00:29:17.010
orbit and entering in on the commercial sectors.

433
00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:20.720
So it has brought to the dynamic that is a,
is,

434
00:29:21.140 --> 00:29:22.740
is a very interesting dynamic and,

435
00:29:22.780 --> 00:29:27.720
and very inspiring dynamic in particular for the new generations that are very

436
00:29:27.721 --> 00:29:32.250
much,
uh,
looking for,
uh,
with a perspective,

437
00:29:32.251 --> 00:29:37.110
not on the 60,
but with the purse over the youth award of the virtual reality.

438
00:29:37.111 --> 00:29:41.500
Really to get into this kind of adventure.
Uh,
you know,

439
00:29:41.501 --> 00:29:42.334
the program

440
00:29:42.520 --> 00:29:45.940
<v 0>from mask,
uh,
is a,
is,
is very ambitious.</v>

441
00:29:45.941 --> 00:29:50.170
He wants to build sworn this a B Fr,
you know what it is.

442
00:29:50.260 --> 00:29:53.460
And it was to be a part sample.
Is Bfi

443
00:29:55.440 --> 00:30:00.350
a
big falcon?
And they kept track of it.
Okay.
Exactly.

444
00:30:00.490 --> 00:30:04.210
And actually has justice many similar space,
right?

445
00:30:05.890 --> 00:30:09.150
So he has just announced that he plans to after,
I mean the,

446
00:30:09.151 --> 00:30:11.950
the successful flight of [inaudible] nine,

447
00:30:11.951 --> 00:30:16.951
the heavy lift is planning to have the Bfr by 2019 and the 2019.

448
00:30:19.210 --> 00:30:23.080
And this should be able to be the vacant because when we talk about exploration,

449
00:30:23.110 --> 00:30:25.490
you have always to to think about how you get there.

450
00:30:26.620 --> 00:30:31.620
And so what makes also his plants saturable is that it first starts from how do

451
00:30:32.351 --> 00:30:36.040
we go there and then what we do.
And the same also,

452
00:30:36.041 --> 00:30:40.660
I mean for,
and that's one.
So maybe something,

453
00:30:40.680 --> 00:30:45.640
uh,
I'm convinced this is a private landscape is changing,

454
00:30:45.641 --> 00:30:49.270
challenging and it's very useful for transforming.

455
00:30:50.220 --> 00:30:51.790
But we have also,

456
00:30:51.791 --> 00:30:56.791
I think on the public side and institutional side to keep some safe rules.

457
00:30:59.420 --> 00:31:03.100
I would say for example,
for the Moon Village,
uh,

458
00:31:03.130 --> 00:31:07.240
we will have to think in terms of preservation of some things that she's a bad

459
00:31:07.241 --> 00:31:12.241
came wandering many tape mode and the way to work with scientists wanting to do

460
00:31:15.191 --> 00:31:19.900
some kind of experiment and all the other sides and mining industries.

461
00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:22.510
So we will have to,
to cope and to,
to,

462
00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:25.510
to make the Armani and synergy in between for example.

463
00:31:26.050 --> 00:31:30.250
And then for Mars exploration.
I have been in space,

464
00:31:30.280 --> 00:31:34.480
I know and we discussed the fact that the recent changes in genes first got

465
00:31:34.481 --> 00:31:39.160
Kelly.
So we know that there is physiological constraints.
That's a raise,
uh,
uh,

466
00:31:39.161 --> 00:31:42.250
radiation,
uh,
difficulties,

467
00:31:42.490 --> 00:31:47.290
psychological speaking about Mars mission and the twins.

468
00:31:47.291 --> 00:31:52.291
For me It's not a chore clears that we will be ready to go to Mars in 10 or 20

469
00:31:55.001 --> 00:31:58.360
years from now.
We need to keep,

470
00:31:58.840 --> 00:32:00.190
um,

471
00:32:01.060 --> 00:32:04.660
with the understanding that we have for the time being of there.

472
00:32:05.260 --> 00:32:09.280
And it's not just a question to access somewhere when we are speaking about

473
00:32:09.281 --> 00:32:13.810
Schuman specified,
but access,
preserving,
leaving,

474
00:32:14.410 --> 00:32:19.410
keeping safe and coming back for the time being never,

475
00:32:19.750 --> 00:32:24.430
yeah,
we had a sample return for Mars.
That means that we know how to go there,

476
00:32:25.180 --> 00:32:29.320
but we don't know how to come back.
And that means for me.

477
00:32:29.321 --> 00:32:30.880
So I want to keep cool,

478
00:32:30.940 --> 00:32:35.940
we say for this kind of a Mars zero with their return mission,

479
00:32:37.090 --> 00:32:41.000
I think ethically and industry to institutionally,

480
00:32:41.630 --> 00:32:45.950
<v 2>I cannot be in favor of this kind of thing.
So that's where I put her.</v>

481
00:32:45.951 --> 00:32:50.200
So this,
this uh,
ability to the um,

482
00:32:52.100 --> 00:32:54.770
public policies to build.

483
00:32:54.771 --> 00:32:59.570
So keeping some safe paradigm and think about the European Space Agency.

484
00:32:59.571 --> 00:33:04.571
We are 22 member states coming from all over Europe and Europe is a different,

485
00:33:05.700 --> 00:33:09.320
uh,
I mean,
Eh,
you have,
we have more than 40 languages.

486
00:33:09.560 --> 00:33:12.340
Talk About Amanda says,
uh,

487
00:33:12.500 --> 00:33:16.600
we have also Canada as a company thing state.
Uh,
and then,
uh,

488
00:33:16.760 --> 00:33:21.740
we have,
I mean,
this international aspect,
it's really future of us and,
uh,

489
00:33:21.750 --> 00:33:26.270
it's,
it's another future is the,
is the fact that we have multi year funding.

490
00:33:26.271 --> 00:33:31.250
So once we agree on something,
we,
it's very difficult.
We go back.

491
00:33:31.251 --> 00:33:31.790
So we are,

492
00:33:31.790 --> 00:33:36.600
we're a very interesting international partner also for this aspect of,
of,
uh,

493
00:33:36.630 --> 00:33:39.530
in a way,
the fact that we don't change,

494
00:33:39.590 --> 00:33:44.210
we have no reason to change in plants every year,
but we have been able,

495
00:33:44.211 --> 00:33:44.720
uh,

496
00:33:44.720 --> 00:33:49.720
putting all these talents together to do things that a single a nation cannot

497
00:33:51.861 --> 00:33:52.261
afford,

498
00:33:52.261 --> 00:33:57.261
that we have been able to a few or to go to land a Robo on a spinning car mat at

499
00:33:58.131 --> 00:34:02.640
400 million kilometers for here from here.
Uh,
and

500
00:34:04.190 --> 00:34:04.720
Jose,

501
00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:09.720
there was an automation that just dropped a feeler on the surface of the

502
00:34:10.150 --> 00:34:13.370
comments.
This was amazing.
This was a,

503
00:34:13.371 --> 00:34:17.690
it would say almost our men on the moon at the time because this was completely,

504
00:34:17.720 --> 00:34:21.740
uh,
an achievement that was a completely new,

505
00:34:22.340 --> 00:34:23.061
uh,

506
00:34:23.061 --> 00:34:27.620
and was interesting was the fact that we want there to understand how water come

507
00:34:27.830 --> 00:34:30.950
came on earth.
And we found water on,
uh,

508
00:34:30.970 --> 00:34:35.180
on the comment on true ray because too much,
too long name.
Uh,

509
00:34:35.210 --> 00:34:39.890
but this water cannot be the water that we have or not and can never become.

510
00:34:40.010 --> 00:34:44.200
So these are little pieces of uh,
uh,
uh,
it's,

511
00:34:44.250 --> 00:34:48.320
it's very,
uh,
let's see.
Heavy water,
so cannot become the Woodrow versions,

512
00:34:48.740 --> 00:34:52.670
but all these moments that brings together the sense of belonging and the fact

513
00:34:52.671 --> 00:34:56.600
that while joining forces,
you cannot choose something is also the straw.

514
00:34:56.630 --> 00:35:01.220
And cooperating with international tartar is the strength on this institutional

515
00:35:01.221 --> 00:35:05.660
partners.
Uh,
and how really you get the citizens,

516
00:35:05.690 --> 00:35:10.220
uh,
feeling the sense of achieving to whether something while on the private

517
00:35:10.230 --> 00:35:13.370
sector's the drivers are different.
So it's a,

518
00:35:14.340 --> 00:35:17.030
there is an element of,
you know,

519
00:35:17.250 --> 00:35:20.900
as Silicon Valley Classic Tech Entrepreneur going into this field because a lot

520
00:35:20.901 --> 00:35:24.650
of their,
you know,
a lot of the artists like valley and be fast and break things.

521
00:35:24.651 --> 00:35:26.540
And that's not something you can really do with space.
Right.

522
00:35:26.541 --> 00:35:28.760
It gets a lot more complicated.
Um,

523
00:35:29.030 --> 00:35:30.890
so I've got a couple more questions and I'm going to hand it over to the

524
00:35:30.891 --> 00:35:34.880
audience for your questions if that's okay.
And I'd love to get back to Vf,

525
00:35:34.881 --> 00:35:38.100
ours and 10% of astronauts being women.

526
00:35:38.610 --> 00:35:38.940
<v 0>Uh,
you know,</v>

527
00:35:38.940 --> 00:35:42.060
obviously if this whole mission is about discovering new worlds and inventing

528
00:35:42.061 --> 00:35:44.940
new ways of living,
um,
and exploring the I known,

529
00:35:44.941 --> 00:35:48.780
it's really important that we represent the world itself really well in that,

530
00:35:48.810 --> 00:35:50.460
in that mission.
Um,

531
00:35:50.730 --> 00:35:53.720
obviously I sell a unit chief diversity officer and you spoke earlier today

532
00:35:53.730 --> 00:35:57.870
about the pipeline challenge of not enough women applying to become astronauts.

533
00:35:57.900 --> 00:36:00.230
I think first things first,
I'd love to ask you,
um,

534
00:36:00.390 --> 00:36:02.820
for those in the audience who might be thinking,
oh,
I should become an astronaut.

535
00:36:03.210 --> 00:36:06.000
What do you need to apply to become an astronaut?
I know that's a silly question.

536
00:36:06.720 --> 00:36:08.610
I think probably is a bit too late for me,
but maybe,

537
00:36:11.210 --> 00:36:15.990
um,
uh,
as I said before,
there is very different profiles.

538
00:36:16.510 --> 00:36:21.030
You have a pyros engineering or aerospace or,

539
00:36:21.360 --> 00:36:24.540
uh,
researchers in different fields.

540
00:36:25.080 --> 00:36:28.320
I think that the main point is to,

541
00:36:29.280 --> 00:36:31.440
to look for other time or for selection.

542
00:36:31.530 --> 00:36:35.220
I cannot say today when will be the next election of the European Space Agency.

543
00:36:36.440 --> 00:36:40.830
Last one was in 2008.
But I'm sure that there will be another one,

544
00:36:41.580 --> 00:36:45.390
um,
zones.
That's mainly what you said.

545
00:36:45.391 --> 00:36:50.391
It's the desire to have them then the commitments to enter in it.

546
00:36:51.390 --> 00:36:55.230
So what,
uh,
um,
then patients

547
00:36:57.030 --> 00:37:02.030
best server runs and determination because the a long time to to go through um,

548
00:37:05.280 --> 00:37:06.720
um,
to um,

549
00:37:07.230 --> 00:37:10.300
the chance healthy terms too,

550
00:37:10.430 --> 00:37:13.410
too bad because for a rounds of,
for example,

551
00:37:13.411 --> 00:37:15.330
the last election of the Europeans were sentence,

552
00:37:15.350 --> 00:37:20.350
I think there was 8,000 candidates we send personal female candidate and a six

553
00:37:23.280 --> 00:37:24.180
has been selected.

554
00:37:24.750 --> 00:37:29.250
I'm convinced that there are more than six talented persons to bear.

555
00:37:29.580 --> 00:37:34.580
So that means there is a part of John's and we have to organize everything,

556
00:37:35.910 --> 00:37:39.960
know to,
to build this a chance.
But what's the,
uh,

557
00:37:39.961 --> 00:37:43.010
wanted to underline with um,

558
00:37:43.040 --> 00:37:46.250
discussion with Earth Eylea about does this,
um,

559
00:37:47.570 --> 00:37:52.570
at directiveness or deficit of attractiveness for science engineering carriers.

560
00:37:54.060 --> 00:37:57.120
I think we have really to think in terms of,
uh,

561
00:37:57.840 --> 00:38:00.510
science and technology years are the two pillars.

562
00:38:00.511 --> 00:38:02.940
In order to cope with the big challenges,

563
00:38:02.941 --> 00:38:06.750
that's where we have in the 21st century.
And we will have and to,

564
00:38:06.751 --> 00:38:09.180
to find some new solution.

565
00:38:09.870 --> 00:38:14.870
But if we try to speak just about the scientific approach,

566
00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:18.930
the hard science,
the regular,

567
00:38:20.040 --> 00:38:23.310
it's maybe not so attractive for

568
00:38:24.960 --> 00:38:28.870
male and female,
I would say,
but popping up because we need to have an,

569
00:38:29.580 --> 00:38:31.170
a feeling of,
uh,

570
00:38:32.400 --> 00:38:36.790
what we will give entering,
engaging in a,

571
00:38:36.791 --> 00:38:38.830
in some way that's been good.

572
00:38:38.840 --> 00:38:42.850
The tuna context in the sons for the life as the twin,

573
00:38:43.180 --> 00:38:47.860
we have to take the humanities back in.
Science,

574
00:38:47.861 --> 00:38:52.861
engineering and digital culture can be a good link in between this.

575
00:38:55.080 --> 00:38:59.900
So humanities,
technology,
computing,
science,
butter.

576
00:38:59.901 --> 00:39:03.700
So responsibility about where are we going?

577
00:39:04.300 --> 00:39:08.980
Human inside.
Okay.
So we have to think in terms of our responsibility.

578
00:39:08.981 --> 00:39:11.350
We have to develop something.
So,
so for me,

579
00:39:11.410 --> 00:39:16.330
what is really neat now speaking about science,
technology,
engineering,

580
00:39:16.331 --> 00:39:17.164
mathematics,

581
00:39:17.230 --> 00:39:22.230
you're starting to put that in culture and coming back with humanities are I

582
00:39:23.531 --> 00:39:27.490
think in the [inaudible] curriculum,

583
00:39:27.640 --> 00:39:32.500
it's maybe easier to have this in France for example,

584
00:39:32.501 --> 00:39:33.530
I don't know in Italy,

585
00:39:34.430 --> 00:39:39.430
in France as you choose to Shanti Fail Cheese,

586
00:39:40.140 --> 00:39:44.650
oh,
chose the Eh,
you managers I would say.
And it's difficult to,
to,

587
00:39:44.700 --> 00:39:48.290
to put up and I think it's one of the,
um,

588
00:39:48.940 --> 00:39:53.440
problem in our curriculum.
So for me with the time,

589
00:39:53.770 --> 00:39:56.450
I think that's more and more important to ever,

590
00:39:56.451 --> 00:40:01.451
so you managers thinking philosophies survey and as a registered say it long

591
00:40:03.191 --> 00:40:07.000
time ago,
he says that there is three pillars,
epistemic,

592
00:40:08.230 --> 00:40:12.790
epistemic science research techniques.
That means technology,

593
00:40:12.791 --> 00:40:16.930
engineering and fantasies and furnaces.

594
00:40:17.290 --> 00:40:21.460
That's I would say is,
um,
wisdom to act.

595
00:40:23.080 --> 00:40:27.370
And I'm sure you had to wear this paper from MUSC.

596
00:40:27.371 --> 00:40:32.371
Prensky about digital wisdom that we have are so in this world of the digital

597
00:40:34.421 --> 00:40:35.140
culture,

598
00:40:35.140 --> 00:40:40.140
it is yours to keep in mind is kinesis and with them and pharmacists will not

599
00:40:40.841 --> 00:40:44.080
come strictly from hard sciences and engineering.

600
00:40:45.640 --> 00:40:47.950
How are you thinking about with that in mind,

601
00:40:47.951 --> 00:40:52.270
how you're thinking about that pipeline and kind of getting more girls and women

602
00:40:52.290 --> 00:40:56.500
into the application process?
Um,
and I think there is something around,

603
00:40:57.100 --> 00:41:00.160
often,
certainly in the startup world we focus on hard tech roles.

604
00:41:00.161 --> 00:41:02.890
Whereas I would argue there are many wells make companies successful in all

605
00:41:02.891 --> 00:41:04.000
companies including this one.

606
00:41:04.830 --> 00:41:08.490
How are you thinking about getting more gossip and Ntsa in general checking the

607
00:41:08.560 --> 00:41:09.240
astronauts?

608
00:41:09.240 --> 00:41:10.560
<v 2>We have,
uh,</v>

609
00:41:10.620 --> 00:41:15.390
we have a paradox in Europe where we have now in almost all countries,

610
00:41:15.450 --> 00:41:18.620
the girls are number both in terms of the,

611
00:41:18.660 --> 00:41:23.250
I mean graduation so that we have more girls graduating.
However,

612
00:41:23.280 --> 00:41:26.390
the science field is still a boys' club.
Uh,

613
00:41:26.520 --> 00:41:31.290
we say we used to say doctors come from Venus and engineer from Mars.

614
00:41:31.670 --> 00:41:34.550
You see the latest,
uh,

615
00:41:34.640 --> 00:41:39.640
there is really a much higher repetition for boys to get into stem.

616
00:41:39.651 --> 00:41:40.820
So Science,
technology,

617
00:41:40.821 --> 00:41:45.821
engineering and maths than for birds and in the digital awards is even much

618
00:41:45.831 --> 00:41:48.650
worse.
You are really a level today.

619
00:41:48.680 --> 00:41:51.850
Most of Wikipedia is written by man and a,

620
00:41:51.860 --> 00:41:55.520
and there are very few women in digital worlds.
And that's the case today.

621
00:41:56.310 --> 00:41:59.750
But that we,
this is our technical office to

622
00:42:01.510 --> 00:42:05.750
exactly,
but it is a,
there is,
we know today from,

623
00:42:05.751 --> 00:42:10.751
I mean there are many things that influence this and one of the things he's also

624
00:42:11.151 --> 00:42:16.151
related to stereotypes and the way or to the context bring six petition or with

625
00:42:17.151 --> 00:42:19.580
respect to the career.
So girls and boys.

626
00:42:20.030 --> 00:42:24.830
So we are engaging with the old space sector actors who industries engaging a to

627
00:42:24.831 --> 00:42:29.030
fight the stereotypes.
But uh,
and uh,

628
00:42:29.090 --> 00:42:34.090
really to be more vocal about this power of transformation then space can

629
00:42:34.101 --> 00:42:37.430
brings.
But as a,
as a Claudia was saying,

630
00:42:37.490 --> 00:42:41.920
we are trying also to change the narrative with respect to the stand,
uh,

631
00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:46.430
in particular engineering,
uh,
and technology because,
um,

632
00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:49.430
we are facing a big revolution.

633
00:42:49.431 --> 00:42:53.600
We know the future of work means that would be a polarization of skills.

634
00:42:53.601 --> 00:42:57.110
So you will,
you will need skills,
uh,

635
00:42:57.111 --> 00:43:01.190
that relates to persuasion,
amputee,
multiple thinking.

636
00:43:01.191 --> 00:43:05.540
And I usually get the provocation thing that it looked that for Robo will be

637
00:43:05.541 --> 00:43:08.220
easier to replace men than women.
We are.

638
00:43:08.320 --> 00:43:11.870
And that there is a theory of how the stereotypes,

639
00:43:12.740 --> 00:43:16.910
but we want to tell the story of the stem of the future,

640
00:43:16.911 --> 00:43:21.911
not the stammer to the Er because engineering today's some tank but through the

641
00:43:22.371 --> 00:43:23.610
digital,
uh,
the,

642
00:43:24.120 --> 00:43:28.610
I mean the coming of the digitalization or robotic sound sound and the new

643
00:43:28.611 --> 00:43:32.350
challenges or had,
so we these,
that the expiration,

644
00:43:32.360 --> 00:43:34.400
the settlers climate change,

645
00:43:34.670 --> 00:43:39.430
we need a completely new set of,
uh,
of jobs that the,

646
00:43:39.440 --> 00:43:44.270
what we called the bridgers,
the orchestrators,
the,

647
00:43:44.271 --> 00:43:49.271
and these are the jobs in stamp for tomorrow and which are also include this

648
00:43:50.061 --> 00:43:53.480
aspect of humanities.
So not just that thing,

649
00:43:53.481 --> 00:43:58.040
but it's a bt to think at large and we promoting this,

650
00:43:58.100 --> 00:43:59.750
uh,
we,

651
00:43:59.780 --> 00:44:04.780
we want really to get different narrative about what these jobs are as from is

652
00:44:05.391 --> 00:44:08.210
the perception today that these careers are,

653
00:44:08.240 --> 00:44:12.070
so we really are investing now in this,
uh,

654
00:44:12.071 --> 00:44:13.550
in this branding in a way.

655
00:44:14.690 --> 00:44:17.240
And coming back to the profession of astronauts,

656
00:44:17.870 --> 00:44:22.870
I would say that's typically a profession where you need to have abilities to go

657
00:44:25.431 --> 00:44:29.780
in different fields.
I say that there is different but grown at the beginning.

658
00:44:30.050 --> 00:44:31.980
But then you become an engineer or you

659
00:44:31.980 --> 00:44:36.370
<v 0>become a partner in a crew,
you became a diplomat and uh,</v>

660
00:44:36.810 --> 00:44:37.620
um,

661
00:44:37.620 --> 00:44:41.990
and you think about humanity when looking through the window and the boat's

662
00:44:42.110 --> 00:44:46.620
planet.
I love it.
Final question then I'm going to hand over to all of you.

663
00:44:46.990 --> 00:44:49.950
Um,
I always like to end with a fill in the blank question where I'm going to ask

664
00:44:49.951 --> 00:44:52.750
you something and I'd love a very short answer.
Please.
Um,

665
00:44:53.100 --> 00:44:58.100
space is no limits is a perspective.

666
00:44:59.050 --> 00:45:03.600
Hmm.
Um,
a book that I always recommend is brief history of time.

667
00:45:04.070 --> 00:45:07.590
Oh,
the pudgy past or something.

668
00:45:07.591 --> 00:45:10.390
So petty and I love it.
I love that book.
Um,

669
00:45:10.470 --> 00:45:15.330
the best advice I ever got was never take a no for an answer.

670
00:45:18.370 --> 00:45:22.110
Uh,
excuse me.
The best advice I ever got was,

671
00:45:22.860 --> 00:45:26.400
uh,
maybe not advice,
but,
uh,
uh,

672
00:45:27.330 --> 00:45:32.330
when is the last time when you did something for the first time?

673
00:45:34.200 --> 00:45:38.520
Said to me sort of with thinking new and finally,
um,

674
00:45:39.130 --> 00:45:41.370
googless can help the European space station by

675
00:45:43.830 --> 00:45:48.830
for me is by stretching the imagination or what can become possible.

676
00:45:49.820 --> 00:45:53.780
Yup.
Um,
come in.

677
00:45:53.870 --> 00:45:54.990
<v 3>Next is the moon village,</v>

678
00:45:55.020 --> 00:45:58.920
but evolving involving everyone,

679
00:45:58.921 --> 00:46:00.150
young generation.

680
00:46:00.210 --> 00:46:05.190
<v 0>What is,
I don't know.
And sayings,
a virtual reality.</v>

681
00:46:05.191 --> 00:46:07.360
Um,
oh,
we can help me in,

682
00:46:07.780 --> 00:46:11.520
in getting involving the same generation in it.
I love it.

683
00:46:11.730 --> 00:46:13.650
What's the URL for the Moon village by the way?

684
00:46:13.651 --> 00:46:17.010
Is there a micro site we can look at with information?
Well,

685
00:46:17.011 --> 00:46:20.850
just beginning in the settings.
That's it.
Yes.
Would it be so wonderful?
Yeah.

686
00:46:21.540 --> 00:46:26.220
Audience.
What would you like to ask
one hand in front row.

687
00:46:27.350 --> 00:46:29.190
Oh,
I don't think we've got Mike friends too because we are recording

688
00:46:31.130 --> 00:46:31.963
<v 1>please.</v>

689
00:46:34.890 --> 00:46:35.723
<v 0>Huh?</v>

690
00:46:37.900 --> 00:46:41.600
<v 4>Hi,
Debra Patel is Google.
I hope so.</v>

691
00:46:41.690 --> 00:46:45.520
I hope you liked the star city for your time there.

692
00:46:45.730 --> 00:46:49.630
So I was both the astronauts and the scientists.

693
00:46:49.660 --> 00:46:54.190
Where do you stand on the question of do human actually need to go?
It's space.

694
00:46:54.220 --> 00:46:59.220
Is there a space is a place for human space exploration that will just need to

695
00:46:59.861 --> 00:47:02.470
go with rope?
Put sentence,
uh,
telescopes.

696
00:47:05.060 --> 00:47:09.430
<v 3>Okay.
Yeah.
You're just going along the way.
Okay.</v>

697
00:47:10.220 --> 00:47:11.390
<v 0>No,
uh,</v>

698
00:47:11.640 --> 00:47:16.640
I'm sure that your share the fact that a human will go further and explore and

699
00:47:17.851 --> 00:47:22.530
it's not the same when you have a,
I would say,
uh,

700
00:47:22.740 --> 00:47:27.280
astro note telling this feeling of,
uh,

701
00:47:27.580 --> 00:47:32.560
Bertie freedom in micro of the low through the window.
And uh,

702
00:47:32.890 --> 00:47:37.250
so this embodiment,
uh,
encounters,
uh,
uh,

703
00:47:37.400 --> 00:47:41.740
as a dream that you have and humanity will go further,

704
00:47:41.741 --> 00:47:42.940
further and explore.

705
00:47:43.660 --> 00:47:48.660
But for me it's not a Turrell and competition in between the automatic universe

706
00:47:49.961 --> 00:47:51.700
sciences and uh,

707
00:47:52.210 --> 00:47:56.890
this human desire to,
to,
to go further.

708
00:47:57.040 --> 00:48:00.700
And I think he's a really complimentary,

709
00:48:00.701 --> 00:48:04.230
I want one speaking about,
for example,
a movie latencies

710
00:48:05.760 --> 00:48:06.790
shift,
uh,

711
00:48:06.820 --> 00:48:11.820
in between exploration and expansion for humanity going on another planet and

712
00:48:14.531 --> 00:48:18.250
the settlers as well as a explorers.

713
00:48:18.280 --> 00:48:22.120
It's for me or so a way to have an off beat.

714
00:48:22.240 --> 00:48:26.500
I would say glancing gays,
you know,
the,
to

715
00:48:28.540 --> 00:48:33.540
come back to her with a new solution because we will ask new problems in this

716
00:48:33.600 --> 00:48:37.680
hostile environment.
So it's,
for me,
that's that something that is completely,

717
00:48:37.750 --> 00:48:40.900
completely synergistic I would say.

718
00:48:41.620 --> 00:48:44.260
And I will not put to priority.

719
00:48:45.430 --> 00:48:50.430
And because science is a science with all the dimension and a,

720
00:48:51.431 --> 00:48:52.260
as I said,

721
00:48:52.260 --> 00:48:57.260
the not just a dimension of new knowledge but also new opportunities and I think

722
00:48:59.021 --> 00:49:02.170
this human spaceflight sort.
So,
um,

723
00:49:02.350 --> 00:49:05.290
opportunities that will open new or raisins.

724
00:49:09.480 --> 00:49:10.313
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

725
00:49:11.630 --> 00:49:14.420
<v 5>Um,
this question is for cloudy.
Um,</v>

726
00:49:14.450 --> 00:49:18.290
you mentioned that looking through the window is all about perspective and I was

727
00:49:18.291 --> 00:49:22.430
wondering if maybe you could share the kind of perspective that that gave you.

728
00:49:25.680 --> 00:49:30.070
<v 0>Is there a reason I was not just thinking in terms of human space flight.</v>

729
00:49:30.071 --> 00:49:34.270
When I say perspective for me for example,
uh,

730
00:49:34.300 --> 00:49:39.300
one of the most powerful conquest of the space race and the beginning and uh,

731
00:49:40.300 --> 00:49:44.010
uh,
57 who is the first Sputnik in a,

732
00:49:44.050 --> 00:49:46.210
in space is,
uh,

733
00:49:46.330 --> 00:49:51.100
also this ability to have a new Gazans the planet for example,

734
00:49:51.180 --> 00:49:54.730
and the ecological feeling consciousness.

735
00:49:54.790 --> 00:49:58.000
I think it's coming from that point.

736
00:49:58.090 --> 00:50:03.090
So this is for me or soon aspect of new perspective in order to reconsider a

737
00:50:03.460 --> 00:50:08.460
earth new perspective because it's open opportunities and new developments and a

738
00:50:09.400 --> 00:50:14.200
no let for humanity.
So that's also a new perspective.

739
00:50:14.530 --> 00:50:19.210
And,
uh,
strictly speaking,
looking through the window.

740
00:50:19.420 --> 00:50:21.220
So you see,
uh,

741
00:50:21.410 --> 00:50:24.940
the planet like that youth is the beauty of this planet.

742
00:50:25.540 --> 00:50:30.320
You have this overview effect.
So it was a beauty of the planet,
Bertrand Russell,

743
00:50:31.040 --> 00:50:35.060
the black customers.
This mister is,
is um,

744
00:50:35.810 --> 00:50:37.970
uh,
um,

745
00:50:39.140 --> 00:50:43.730
you put one smart humanity and human responsibility.

746
00:50:44.270 --> 00:50:48.860
Visa VI is this a this Bennet and um,

747
00:50:48.920 --> 00:50:53.920
it's meant to the very thin layer of atmosphere that means the fragility.

748
00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:03.920
It's a also perspective because when you are on earth,
okay,

749
00:51:03.921 --> 00:51:08.870
you got some media saying be careful with this is this,
uh,

750
00:51:08.990 --> 00:51:13.790
hair really it's even much more than a perspective is that's a fact.

751
00:51:14.860 --> 00:51:15.800
You have it.
Yeah.

752
00:51:19.300 --> 00:51:20.133
<v 1>On that.</v>

753
00:51:23.430 --> 00:51:28.360
<v 6>Hello?
I just went to say,
I'm so happy that you're here because when I was,
uh,</v>

754
00:51:28.800 --> 00:51:29.611
when I was a kid,

755
00:51:29.611 --> 00:51:34.180
I saw you on TV and I was amazed that you would do that,
um,

756
00:51:34.380 --> 00:51:38.700
and said this is great.
Um,
you talked about responsibility and um,

757
00:51:39.090 --> 00:51:43.680
perspective.
I'm just wondering,
uh,
food up Moon Project for example,

758
00:51:43.740 --> 00:51:47.530
Moon village.
Um,
what do you think the,

759
00:51:49.140 --> 00:51:53.820
the actual objective things that we should be doing to protect,
protect a moon.

760
00:51:53.850 --> 00:51:56.640
And um,
we were talking,

761
00:51:57.180 --> 00:52:01.740
you said that Ms. Spears very thin when we're here we don't really care so much

762
00:52:01.741 --> 00:52:03.660
or not as much as we should.

763
00:52:03.960 --> 00:52:08.960
What should we put in place to protect where we are exploring where we may be

764
00:52:09.760 --> 00:52:10.593
settling?

765
00:52:11.260 --> 00:52:16.220
<v 0>Uh,
that's what's for me very interesting in this concept of the molecular too</v>

766
00:52:16.230 --> 00:52:20.670
because we will have to have this kind of question.
Uh,

767
00:52:20.720 --> 00:52:24.100
Undertale Warren's a different step of the buildings,

768
00:52:24.140 --> 00:52:27.520
the concept four for shores,
there is a technological,

769
00:52:27.530 --> 00:52:29.970
I would say building blocks that we have to,

770
00:52:30.050 --> 00:52:34.110
to to put in the table in order to have the right protection for the habitat for

771
00:52:34.570 --> 00:52:38.760
our,
the,
the way to extract oxygen from the

772
00:52:40.340 --> 00:52:43.890
ice ones,
a pull of the moon.
So this is one part.

773
00:52:44.610 --> 00:52:49.610
Then if we really considered the concept as working with private companies was

774
00:52:51.510 --> 00:52:56.510
economical interest and Sundays I said we would have to seek in terms of the

775
00:52:57.130 --> 00:53:00.300
right cooperation harmoni in between the interest,

776
00:53:00.840 --> 00:53:04.940
then we would have to cope with what I said already is,

777
00:53:04.980 --> 00:53:09.980
is a treaty and the you need to nation defining the [inaudible] books as,

778
00:53:12.080 --> 00:53:13.200
as um,

779
00:53:13.730 --> 00:53:17.490
as the moon as a [inaudible] insights is mean to,

780
00:53:17.491 --> 00:53:21.540
to preserve something as a [inaudible] element.
They manage it.

781
00:53:21.960 --> 00:53:24.960
So we let to,
to keep that in mind.
Uh,

782
00:53:25.170 --> 00:53:30.170
for sure we will have to define also those are the rules I would say for them.

783
00:53:31.770 --> 00:53:36.240
Um,
international governments since different partners because,

784
00:53:36.250 --> 00:53:40.440
uh,
mainly cooperation in a global project,

785
00:53:40.470 --> 00:53:42.210
which are so competition in,
in,

786
00:53:42.211 --> 00:53:46.290
in dealing with some elements and um,

787
00:53:46.890 --> 00:53:51.300
the way to organize their life of say inhabitants of the is,

788
00:53:51.330 --> 00:53:55.920
is the mornings for phase.
So is there is a lot of thing to elaborate.

789
00:53:55.921 --> 00:53:57.060
Think about Hannah.

790
00:53:57.480 --> 00:54:01.770
I would like that to be taken really seriously,

791
00:54:01.910 --> 00:54:04.950
progressively.
Um,
uh,

792
00:54:04.980 --> 00:54:08.930
the technical element is just one part of the project,

793
00:54:08.931 --> 00:54:13.350
but all the suspect men's needs are so that we have with us,

794
00:54:13.830 --> 00:54:16.660
the jury's dizzy.

795
00:54:17.160 --> 00:54:21.050
Sociology's the philosophers,
um,

796
00:54:21.360 --> 00:54:25.320
architects because that's a complex architecture to organize.

797
00:54:25.560 --> 00:54:30.560
So that's why it's a lot of potential in thinking in that terms.

798
00:54:30.631 --> 00:54:34.200
And I said,
uh,
we have the chance to,

799
00:54:34.440 --> 00:54:37.830
to think out of the atmosphere and not just out of the books.
So

800
00:54:40.060 --> 00:54:42.990
I love it.
I think that was one,
oh,
we've just got one over there.

801
00:54:47.730 --> 00:54:48.080
<v 1>Okay.</v>

802
00:54:48.080 --> 00:54:52.160
<v 7>I just wanted to pick up a little bit more on what Sarah mentioned a little bit</v>

803
00:54:52.161 --> 00:54:55.190
earlier,
our loan about your sense of self.

804
00:54:55.191 --> 00:54:58.550
I'm both of you talked about sense of self and a really interesting way you

805
00:54:58.551 --> 00:55:02.630
mentioned that you,
I wanted to change your center of gravity from,

806
00:55:02.631 --> 00:55:06.710
from a very insular person to something.
Uh,
yeah.

807
00:55:06.830 --> 00:55:07.790
More expansive.

808
00:55:07.791 --> 00:55:12.791
And when Sarah mentioned any changes that each felt when you came home from

809
00:55:13.071 --> 00:55:16.390
space,
you spoke in a very,
uh,

810
00:55:16.520 --> 00:55:19.850
anatomical way about changes you'd felt in your body.

811
00:55:20.900 --> 00:55:23.570
And I guess I wanted to ask a question of,

812
00:55:23.840 --> 00:55:28.840
has a life I'm in space and working in this new world changed your sense of

813
00:55:31.131 --> 00:55:32.330
self?
Do you know,

814
00:55:32.690 --> 00:55:37.690
perhaps relate more strongly to something greater then two,

815
00:55:37.850 --> 00:55:39.290
you are as a person,

816
00:55:39.440 --> 00:55:43.130
have you felt that you've changed your relationship with yourself as a result of

817
00:55:43.131 --> 00:55:46.010
this,
uh,
career path that you've taken?

818
00:55:48.050 --> 00:55:48.883
<v 0>Well,
it's</v>

819
00:55:50.960 --> 00:55:54.970
difficult to say because there was different elements coming in.
Um,

820
00:55:55.160 --> 00:55:56.860
the first is,
um,

821
00:55:57.110 --> 00:56:02.110
relation with you with the hood big portal and the look and the questions that

822
00:56:05.410 --> 00:56:10.340
loves it make sense.
This is the way to,
to communicate,
to,

823
00:56:10.341 --> 00:56:12.830
to interfere,
um,

824
00:56:12.890 --> 00:56:17.890
as this is the first element of [inaudible] I had the chance to have different

825
00:56:20.330 --> 00:56:25.060
life as it has been said.
I've been a medical doctor,
I've been an astronaut,

826
00:56:25.070 --> 00:56:28.940
I've been a minister.
I've been the head of a public establishment.

827
00:56:28.960 --> 00:56:31.540
I was closely cooperating with the Science Museum.

828
00:56:31.541 --> 00:56:35.410
I was in charge of buddy [inaudible] in France.

829
00:56:35.980 --> 00:56:38.290
I'm deeply involved in the innovation.

830
00:56:38.320 --> 00:56:43.270
I've been involved for three years with theologist about,
uh,

831
00:56:43.750 --> 00:56:48.340
uh,
digital challenges with the humanity.

832
00:56:48.620 --> 00:56:52.210
So that's been age different,
uh,

833
00:56:52.240 --> 00:56:56.600
ecosystem different too.
Like for sure it's um,

834
00:56:56.620 --> 00:56:58.400
something that is um,

835
00:56:58.930 --> 00:57:03.930
billing you and what's interesting in life also,

836
00:57:04.690 --> 00:57:09.070
you honor the same at the beginning and the end,
um,
with the um,

837
00:57:09.110 --> 00:57:13.810
opportunities,
meetings person you will and cantor.
So,

838
00:57:13.811 --> 00:57:14.460
um,

839
00:57:14.460 --> 00:57:19.460
I have no really curious to say is that just space space as being for me for

840
00:57:21.821 --> 00:57:26.530
sure a multiplier of this life and the opportunities if I,

841
00:57:26.531 --> 00:57:31.150
if I can say for me is,
is against science and space.

842
00:57:31.180 --> 00:57:35.830
Uh,
and,
and this,
the courage that you get out of this adventure,

843
00:57:36.140 --> 00:57:38.950
a sense,
different sense of belonging.
First of all,

844
00:57:38.951 --> 00:57:42.870
the international side with the same mean I am an Italian.
Uh,

845
00:57:42.910 --> 00:57:47.650
this is also you ask your questions,
but on this global side,
you know,
there is,

846
00:57:48.160 --> 00:57:53.160
there is a sentence that allow from Thomas Elliot which say is poof rock.

847
00:57:53.831 --> 00:57:56.050
I don't know if you'll know this poem where you say,

848
00:57:56.051 --> 00:57:59.470
do I dare to disturb the universe?
And for me,

849
00:57:59.471 --> 00:58:01.960
this is really how myself,

850
00:58:02.320 --> 00:58:05.530
my own self change it through this adventure,

851
00:58:05.560 --> 00:58:10.560
meaning this sense of daring because actually no one cares about.

852
00:58:13.690 --> 00:58:16.810
If you are not doing something well,

853
00:58:16.811 --> 00:58:21.190
if you do something then it can be a difference.
And a,

854
00:58:21.191 --> 00:58:25.390
and again this,
uh,
this sense of a belonging to something big,

855
00:58:25.391 --> 00:58:28.960
much bigger than you and the fact that you are nice,

856
00:58:28.961 --> 00:58:33.470
don't give me this,
uh,
I would say this unconcerned.

857
00:58:33.550 --> 00:58:34.680
So these,
uh,

858
00:58:34.750 --> 00:58:39.130
sometimes it's courage not to bother about what the other thing and not too bad.

859
00:58:39.340 --> 00:58:44.170
And this is an important message if we want to relate also to girls and women

860
00:58:44.171 --> 00:58:48.690
because we know that actually there is an anxiety that comes up from uh,

861
00:58:48.700 --> 00:58:51.400
with respect to scientific subject mathematics and,

862
00:58:51.401 --> 00:58:53.860
and there is a very nice story from Brian Greene,

863
00:58:54.160 --> 00:58:59.160
which is a very famous astrophysicist and a erodes the elegant universe and

864
00:58:59.980 --> 00:59:02.920
explaining and actually wondering why in,

865
00:59:02.921 --> 00:59:07.770
in women who have this form of a,
you don't want to look stupid,

866
00:59:07.771 --> 00:59:11.290
you don't want to ask question and it has the side that it goes to a primary

867
00:59:11.291 --> 00:59:13.090
school,
kids,
a five,

868
00:59:13.091 --> 00:59:16.810
six year olds and ask everyone to do something.

869
00:59:16.840 --> 00:59:20.380
And there is this little girl but he focus,
drawing,
drawing,
drawing.

870
00:59:20.381 --> 00:59:22.100
So he approached her and say,

871
00:59:22.100 --> 00:59:26.000
<v 2>what are you drawing?
And she says,
I'm drawing the fissile God,</v>

872
00:59:26.480 --> 00:59:30.200
the fizzle God,
but no one knows the face of God.
Oh,
in a minute they will,

873
00:59:31.530 --> 00:59:32.363
<v 3>uh,</v>

874
00:59:33.290 --> 00:59:38.290
<v 2>this sense of exactly going back to the sense of I don't care what the other</v>

875
00:59:38.770 --> 00:59:40.970
think.
I,
Eh,

876
00:59:41.100 --> 00:59:46.100
it's a moment I have to go and this will will bring so much to me and should not

877
00:59:49.191 --> 00:59:52.770
be stopped.
I think we have one question that,

878
00:59:56.580 --> 00:59:58.630
and then I think we'll have to do these two.
And I'm finishing my,
Fred,

879
00:59:58.640 --> 00:59:59.580
I think we have one over here.

880
01:00:00.090 --> 01:00:01.020
<v 4>Hopefully it can be quick.</v>

881
01:00:01.110 --> 01:00:06.110
And so my daughter wants to be the first woman on the moon because she's six.

882
01:00:07.350 --> 01:00:10.510
And she says,
well,
why shouldn't I be?
Um,

883
01:00:12.360 --> 01:00:15.280
<v 3>she's the face of God.</v>

884
01:00:18.500 --> 01:00:23.060
<v 4>What's the one thing that you think I can do to support her in that?</v>

885
01:00:23.730 --> 01:00:27.840
<v 2>Yeah.
Okay.
First of all,
uh,
and,</v>

886
01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:31.350
and then I leave clinic to answer.
I also have a girl,
now she's a,

887
01:00:31.351 --> 01:00:35.940
she is older than this,
Matt.
Um,
you know,

888
01:00:35.941 --> 01:00:38.790
we know from studies that girls don't go,

889
01:00:38.791 --> 01:00:41.160
don't apply to positions because they,

890
01:00:41.161 --> 01:00:45.600
if they don't match with the 100 requirements,
they don't go wild man.

891
01:00:45.601 --> 01:00:47.180
Look on the first row,
the license,

892
01:00:47.300 --> 01:00:48.133
<v 3>no one's,</v>

893
01:00:50.580 --> 01:00:54.990
<v 2>this is the sense actually it's a perfect question.
Uh,
after what I said,</v>

894
01:00:55.560 --> 01:00:59.760
there should be a pleasure in PR in,
in going forward.

895
01:00:59.761 --> 01:01:04.761
There should be a pleasure in daring at something that you don't in any way.

896
01:01:05.521 --> 01:01:09.530
This court,
even if it's goes to a failure.
So the sense of failures,

897
01:01:09.531 --> 01:01:13.980
which it should change,
you know that one the,
when I was in the,

898
01:01:13.981 --> 01:01:16.350
in the u s actually after the Columbia accident,

899
01:01:16.380 --> 01:01:20.490
the motto was from NASA was failure is not an option today.

900
01:01:20.491 --> 01:01:23.520
The motto of Naza is fail early,
fail smart.

901
01:01:23.880 --> 01:01:25.770
So the value of failing,

902
01:01:26.190 --> 01:01:31.190
which it doesn't mean that you have lost you are not losing you is just

903
01:01:33.001 --> 01:01:36.960
something that will brings new things and useless ranked.

904
01:01:37.320 --> 01:01:42.320
And if you go through this sense of failure as being part of the path,

905
01:01:43.950 --> 01:01:45.300
I'm sure she will be.

906
01:01:46.010 --> 01:01:51.010
She will be more daring and she will get ready to take this bold steps without

907
01:01:51.061 --> 01:01:56.010
feeling.
When I say don't take no for an answer without thinking,
ah,

908
01:01:56.011 --> 01:01:56.844
this is not,

909
01:01:56.940 --> 01:02:01.800
I'm sure there will be thousands of why me example of cruddy in this sense is,

910
01:02:01.801 --> 01:02:06.090
is a,
is very important.
But the thing is they should be 1000,

911
01:02:06.930 --> 01:02:11.290
so could mean me.
Uh,
and so work on this sense of,

912
01:02:11.291 --> 01:02:14.460
of what is success and what is failing.

913
01:02:14.640 --> 01:02:18.780
Mlr bubble am a capable,
which for girls is very strong.
Sometimes they,

914
01:02:19.170 --> 01:02:20.430
they want to be lovable

915
01:02:20.520 --> 01:02:24.450
<v 0>and the,
and then you pass the message.
You are lovable if you're capable.</v>

916
01:02:24.451 --> 01:02:28.310
So be sure that these are different things and,
and,

917
01:02:28.410 --> 01:02:31.350
and then you get the strength to,
to go from that.

918
01:02:32.470 --> 01:02:33.520
But just,

919
01:02:33.540 --> 01:02:38.540
I would add that it's what's important for me is more the journey,

920
01:02:39.630 --> 01:02:44.580
I would say,
of discovery than the goal and the objective.

921
01:02:44.850 --> 01:02:48.460
That's important too,
to have a goal.
And if you can,
uh,

922
01:02:48.570 --> 01:02:52.140
keep the dream alive for her,
that's perfect.

923
01:02:52.350 --> 01:02:56.820
There's explaining that through Howard is the journey that will be pleasure

924
01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:01.980
discovery with a curiosity and she will gain and gain and gain a lot.

925
01:03:02.570 --> 01:03:06.990
Um,
if the goal is really very,
very ambitious,

926
01:03:07.980 --> 01:03:12.870
we cannot from eyes to,
to get to the goal.
But the journey is a wonderful path.

927
01:03:14.670 --> 01:03:15.690
And our final question,

928
01:03:16.520 --> 01:03:20.480
<v 8>hello pressure.
Um,
you mentioned that you know,
space is not like,
Hey,</v>

929
01:03:20.660 --> 01:03:23.610
I want to go to space next week.
So you know,
less collect plants

930
01:03:25.870 --> 01:03:27.270
and being an astronaut is,
you know,

931
01:03:27.350 --> 01:03:29.810
perhaps at that k or multi decade kind of ambition.

932
01:03:30.260 --> 01:03:33.650
So throughout kind of these very long journeys,

933
01:03:33.651 --> 01:03:37.000
how do you kind of pick yourself up when you go,
oh my God,
I just,
you know,

934
01:03:38.120 --> 01:03:39.880
this week it wasn't as good as last week.

935
01:03:39.881 --> 01:03:43.160
And how do you pick yourself up over very,
very long time period?

936
01:03:45.950 --> 01:03:50.530
<v 0>What's say is that,
uh,
I had a lot of things,
new things.</v>

937
01:03:50.531 --> 01:03:53.950
That's why I explained that as a journey.

938
01:03:54.400 --> 01:03:58.330
So I was a medical doctor.
I'm gauging this phd.

939
01:03:58.331 --> 01:04:00.370
So that's mean discovering the,

940
01:04:00.371 --> 01:04:05.050
working in a laboratory and then discovering the way to cooperate with different

941
01:04:05.051 --> 01:04:08.080
partners.
And then arriving in star city,

942
01:04:08.110 --> 01:04:12.460
as I said at the very beginning of the shift in between the Soviet Union.

943
01:04:13.120 --> 01:04:18.120
So discovering this military environment and the blackboard there was a black,

944
01:04:20.340 --> 01:04:24.430
uh,
in order to,
to get my first lesson in Russian,

945
01:04:24.431 --> 01:04:29.431
in order to make us a design of a certain element.

946
01:04:30.070 --> 01:04:34.600
And then a few years after that coming here,

947
01:04:34.601 --> 01:04:38.440
they are American for example,
with the shuttle Mir poke harm suicides mean,
uh,

948
01:04:38.850 --> 01:04:40.030
uh,
keeping

949
01:04:41.680 --> 01:04:44.770
interested with there's this mixed culture.

950
01:04:44.771 --> 01:04:48.040
I said also that training with uh,
um,

951
01:04:48.460 --> 01:04:50.980
space tourists during,
so

952
01:04:52.990 --> 01:04:56.800
every time there was something new to discover,
to learn.

953
01:04:56.870 --> 01:05:00.520
That's why the journey is something you're really fantastic.

954
01:05:00.650 --> 01:05:03.550
This is a adventure for sure.

955
01:05:03.580 --> 01:05:08.400
I was eager to be on the day of the luncheon,

956
01:05:08.401 --> 01:05:12.630
the launchpad in a,
in Baikonur,
but,
uh,

957
01:05:12.940 --> 01:05:13.960
really enjoyed

958
01:05:15.730 --> 01:05:20.730
16 years of career and I enjoyed after that just to go in life and just sort of

959
01:05:20.831 --> 01:05:24.600
life and so forth when I have now and,
uh,

960
01:05:25.120 --> 01:05:28.450
the sets and I wish we had time to ask you about the mall,

961
01:05:28.451 --> 01:05:32.570
particularly the political,
I'm particularly curious about that,
I think.
Um,
um,

962
01:05:33.070 --> 01:05:36.070
thank you so much.
Both of you.
This is maybe on the political field

963
01:05:38.410 --> 01:05:43.410
just in the first part as a medical lecturer because I wa was bright in my

964
01:05:45.401 --> 01:05:48.620
studios,
so no problem.
Come in and give up.

965
01:05:49.180 --> 01:05:51.530
And with the astronaut,
uh,

966
01:05:51.550 --> 01:05:55.210
also it was relatively easy.
I would,

967
01:05:55.360 --> 01:05:58.370
I would say for me that's interesting in a

968
01:06:00.130 --> 01:06:04.990
bit with political I discover and thing is that,
uh,

969
01:06:05.350 --> 01:06:10.350
I was convinced before entering in politics is that when there is a will,

970
01:06:11.111 --> 01:06:14.540
there is a wage and I discovered not her way.

971
01:06:17.410 --> 01:06:20.920
Um,
thank you both so much for joining us.
It's been amazing.
