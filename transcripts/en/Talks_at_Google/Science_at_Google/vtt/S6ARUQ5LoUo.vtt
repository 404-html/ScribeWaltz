WEBVTT

1
00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:13.070
So I am introducing,
um,
all but degree of as,

2
00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:17.330
as the chief science officer off the Central Research Foundation and he is,
uh,

3
00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:22.380
a major false in aging research and I'm very excited to hear this talk.

4
00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:28.250
<v 0>[inaudible]</v>

5
00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:32.660
<v 2>all right.
Thank you all for coming.
I'm glad to see from any of your hair.
Uh,</v>

6
00:00:32.661 --> 00:00:35.780
yeah,
the only five bucks left over there.

7
00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:40.970
That's about 21 when we came into the room.
So

8
00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:45.310
hurry.
Uh,
but yeah,
I don't,

9
00:00:45.311 --> 00:00:48.710
I'm happy to find them if you're really wanting to be a terribly fanboy kind of

10
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.300
person later on.
Um,
um,
all right.
So yes,
I saw,

11
00:00:52.301 --> 00:00:55.790
I've got an hour so I'm going to cry and tell you as much as I can about what we

12
00:00:55.791 --> 00:01:00.791
do at we fixed foundation and why and why it's important and why you should be

13
00:01:01.161 --> 00:01:02.840
supporting it and how you can support it.

14
00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:05.900
And there were various ways he can do that.
Um,

15
00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:11.170
I'm going to start by giving you a really top level idea because I know

16
00:01:11.361 --> 00:01:14.180
obviously most of you don't have very much in the way of biology.

17
00:01:14.181 --> 00:01:19.181
Craning I'm going to start by saying why I think this is such an important

18
00:01:19.251 --> 00:01:20.690
problem.
Um,

19
00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:26.470
this part of the world by area is really the epicenter of the effective altruism

20
00:01:27.381 --> 00:01:28.220
movement,

21
00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:33.460
the movement that really focuses on rationally determining what is the best way

22
00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:40.010
to spend money on,
um,
you know,
on humanitarian causes,

23
00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:45.410
what gets the best bang for the buck.
And of course people try to figure out,

24
00:01:45.411 --> 00:01:46.244
you know,

25
00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:51.850
what the amount of suffering is that it's caused by this or that problem and,
um,

26
00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:55.310
uh,
what,
um,
what it would cost us to do something about that.

27
00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.300
And they're trying to figure it out from there.
And,
uh,

28
00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:03.360
a lot of this comes down to the trade off between mean and variants.

29
00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:07.011
In other words,

30
00:02:07.011 --> 00:02:12.011
between understanding how much good you can do and understanding the uncertainty

31
00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.750
as regard how much good you can do.
So high risk,

32
00:02:17.751 --> 00:02:22.370
high reward,
um,
then,
uh,
endeavors like,
um,
you know,

33
00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:26.660
pioneering technology often get a kind of,
you know,
the short,

34
00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:28.340
the short end of the,

35
00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:33.170
of the stick when it comes to effective altruism because they don't really,

36
00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.930
um,
you know,
offer the confidence,

37
00:02:35.931 --> 00:02:39.620
the certainty that people like to see with regard to knowing that what they're

38
00:02:39.621 --> 00:02:41.990
doing is actually beneficial.

39
00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:47.680
And the extreme end of that is a of that spectrum is the situation where you

40
00:02:50.001 --> 00:02:52.730
don't know whether the problem is solvable at all,

41
00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:56.360
whether it's not just high risk,
high reward,
it could be 100% risk.

42
00:02:56.361 --> 00:03:00.150
In other words,
you know,
zero chance of success,
however,
there will,

43
00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.960
however large the reward would be.
And now the problem with that is,
you know,

44
00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:09.040
zero times anything is still zero.
So,
um,
you know,
however valuable they,
uh,

45
00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:13.410
the,
the,
the goal might be you wouldn't really want to go that.
And,
um,

46
00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:18.630
certainly the comparison between the defeat of aging versus various other,

47
00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:25.650
um,
you know,
seriously high profile,
um,
major issues today.

48
00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:29.340
The ones that I'm listing on this,
on the,
on the slide,
you know,

49
00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:31.970
that's quite a contrast.
Before it was biology.

50
00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:35.180
So I used to work in artificial intelligence research and the fundamental reason

51
00:03:35.181 --> 00:03:39.190
that I did so was that I didn't think that work with a terribly good thing.

52
00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:39.521
You know,

53
00:03:39.521 --> 00:03:42.970
I think it's a great shame that people have to spend so much of their time doing

54
00:03:42.971 --> 00:03:45.400
stuff that they wouldn't do unless they were being paid for it.

55
00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:49.890
And so I decided I wanted to fix that with automation.
And um,

56
00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:51.790
and I worked in that area,

57
00:03:51.791 --> 00:03:56.791
it actually in software verification for several years before I discovered that

58
00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:02.470
the obviously much more serious problem of aging was actually being worked on

59
00:04:02.471 --> 00:04:06.070
very,
very little indeed by biologists.
And I thought that was a bit crap really.

60
00:04:06.071 --> 00:04:10.810
So I switched fields.
Um,
but when I switched fields,

61
00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:12.430
I realized,
in fact,

62
00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:15.490
actually this was actually part of the reason why I switched fields.

63
00:04:15.491 --> 00:04:20.140
I realized that the people who were working on this,
which were as I say,

64
00:04:20.141 --> 00:04:24.650
only a very small minority of biologists word going about it in a rather

65
00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:29.260
unimpressive way.
They weren't really going about it as engineers.

66
00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:30.430
They weren't really,
you know,

67
00:04:30.431 --> 00:04:33.640
breaking down the problem in a structured manner the way that a programmer might

68
00:04:33.641 --> 00:04:37.900
do.
And,
um,
so that's what I tried to do.
And I started here,

69
00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:41.470
I started with a question we'll look 200 years ago,

70
00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:43.720
even in the wealthiest countries,

71
00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:49.530
more than one third of babies would die before the age of one more than a third.

72
00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:54.600
And of course in the rest of early life,
you know,

73
00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:57.010
and other alternative and you know,
there will be a lot of death,

74
00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:01.570
childbirth especially of course.
And we've pretty much entirely eliminated,

75
00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:03.640
eliminated that now in the industrialized world.

76
00:05:03.641 --> 00:05:07.420
And of course we're doing very well in that direction in the developing world
to,

77
00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:13.120
and we've done it by really elementary means just by figuring out the hygiene

78
00:05:13.121 --> 00:05:15.660
was a good idea.
And by,
you know,
um,

79
00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.930
elementary medicines like vaccines and antibiotics and of course,

80
00:05:19.931 --> 00:05:23.950
even mosquito nets,
you know,
this is a 20 things and they work,

81
00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:26.260
they've said the most ridiculous number of lives,

82
00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:31.600
but we've made virtually no progress against the ill health associated with old

83
00:05:31.601 --> 00:05:34.840
age.
What's going on there?
Why is it so different?

84
00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:37.150
So most people would say that this is the answer.
Don't worry,

85
00:05:37.151 --> 00:05:40.510
you're not supposed to be able to read this slide.
They,
um,
the point here,

86
00:05:40.511 --> 00:05:44.890
and obviously just that there's a lot of complexity and awful lot of different

87
00:05:44.891 --> 00:05:47.560
things go wrong with us late in life and they go wrong,

88
00:05:47.561 --> 00:05:50.170
it more or less the same time,
which means of course,

89
00:05:50.171 --> 00:05:52.660
that they interact with each other,
they exacerbate each other.

90
00:05:52.661 --> 00:05:56.590
The whole thing is a little bit chaotic and so most people would say,
well,

91
00:05:56.591 --> 00:05:58.410
this is fundamentally what's going on there.

92
00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:03.790
The real reason why Adrian has remained so hard to tackle where medicine is the

93
00:06:06.231 --> 00:06:09.890
sheer complexity of the business,
the fact that there's so much going on,

94
00:06:09.891 --> 00:06:14.300
it's just overwhelmed the ability of the medical research community.

95
00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:18.950
Now,
there is a lot of truth in that.
That is definitely part of the problem.

96
00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:23.060
But what are you going to know is that it's not the main part of the problem.

97
00:06:23.061 --> 00:06:27.920
There's a more fundamental reason why aging has been hard to tackle and I'm

98
00:06:27.921 --> 00:06:32.360
going to deal with what that is.
I'm going to start by defining aging.

99
00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:35.270
This turned out to be actually cool.
Pretty tricky.

100
00:06:35.271 --> 00:06:39.110
So Bjork is hosting this day.

101
00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:42.830
I'm actually got an email this morning saying,
listen,
we don't want to fix aging.

102
00:06:42.831 --> 00:06:44.210
You know,
we,
I think it's a good thing.

103
00:06:44.211 --> 00:06:46.760
We want to get older and more knowledgeable and all that kind of stuff.

104
00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:49.160
Of course it bloody do.
That's fairly obvious.

105
00:06:49.161 --> 00:06:52.430
I mean the point of the study is that we want to get rid of the bad parts of

106
00:06:52.431 --> 00:06:56.420
aging and thereby perpetuate and enhance the good parts.

107
00:06:56.750 --> 00:06:59.630
So what aging and and for,

108
00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:02.540
for the purposes of this talk will mean the bad parts of aging.

109
00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:09.860
Aging is not something specific to biology.
You can say,

110
00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:13.760
you can look at certain aspects of biology,
especially who biology.
You can say,

111
00:07:13.761 --> 00:07:16.760
well there's some,
in some sense they are emergent phenomena.
You know,

112
00:07:16.761 --> 00:07:19.970
consciousness.
You know Roxanne in our conscious cars are not conscious.

113
00:07:19.971 --> 00:07:24.710
We knew that,
right?
But aging is actually not an emergent phenomenon.

114
00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:30.190
Aging is a phenomenon that is fundamentally the same in living organisms as it

115
00:07:31.521 --> 00:07:36.521
is in any manmade machine with moving parts like the car.

116
00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:37.813
An airplane.

117
00:07:38.090 --> 00:07:42.560
It is simply a fact of physics that any machine with moving parts is going to do

118
00:07:42.561 --> 00:07:47.561
itself damage throughout its existence as an inevitable consequence of its

119
00:07:48.741 --> 00:07:49.730
normal operation.

120
00:07:49.731 --> 00:07:54.731
It's just a fact of physics and that damage is going to accumulate and that's

121
00:07:54.741 --> 00:07:59.120
fine for a while because any machine living or not is set up to tolerate a

122
00:07:59.121 --> 00:08:03.140
certain amount of damage and you know,
so.

123
00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:04.340
So that's why for example,

124
00:08:04.341 --> 00:08:07.040
cars worked perfectly fine for a few years and you don't have to take it into

125
00:08:07.041 --> 00:08:11.840
the garage.
And it's also why humans work pretty well for a few decades.

126
00:08:11.841 --> 00:08:14.870
So you don't have to take them into the hospital either.

127
00:08:15.170 --> 00:08:20.170
But eventually the tolerable threshold of damage is reached and exceeded and

128
00:08:21.681 --> 00:08:25.850
that's when things start to go downhill.
That's all that aging is.

129
00:08:26.210 --> 00:08:29.540
And the reason I emphasize this is because there is a very widespread

130
00:08:29.541 --> 00:08:33.410
misconception in society that aging is some kind of mystery,

131
00:08:33.590 --> 00:08:37.070
that it's some kind of an enigmatic thing that we absolutely don't understand

132
00:08:37.071 --> 00:08:41.450
and never can.
And you know,
it's somehow off limits from deferred for medicine.

133
00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:43.100
It's just not correct.

134
00:08:43.130 --> 00:08:48.130
This is simply a really obvious and basic thing and we just need to get out of

135
00:08:48.831 --> 00:08:51.140
our heads the idea that it's in any way mysterious.

136
00:08:51.950 --> 00:08:54.500
We can actually describe it industry words.

137
00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:59.040
So I'm now obviously reflecting myself to biology,
to living organisms.

138
00:08:59.970 --> 00:09:04.970
Metabolism is the word that biologists use to encompass all of the stuff that

139
00:09:05.461 --> 00:09:09.270
the body does from one day to the next to keep us going,
keep us alive.

140
00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:10.680
And unless they had,

141
00:09:10.681 --> 00:09:14.430
metabolism creates damage and damage accumulates throughout life,

142
00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:15.900
even starting before we're born.

143
00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:19.410
And eventually there's too much damage and you get the pathologies of all day.

144
00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:22.530
Now I've drawn these arrows in this rather curious way of course,

145
00:09:22.531 --> 00:09:27.531
to emphasize that what we're trying to achieve with the work that we're doing to

146
00:09:28.110 --> 00:09:33.110
eliminate aging is to weaken the link between metabolism and pathology,

147
00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:35.040
the link between being alive and being dead.

148
00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:38.910
And there are various ways in which we might go about that,

149
00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:44.580
but most of them are very misguided and essentially waste of time.

150
00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:46.800
And I'm going to go through a little bit of what that,

151
00:09:46.830 --> 00:09:49.770
why that is before going onto what's going to work.

152
00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:55.400
So what I'm showing you here is the answer that most people would give to a very

153
00:09:58.141 --> 00:10:02.520
simple question.
The question in what ways can one be sick?

154
00:10:02.610 --> 00:10:06.900
Can people be sick?
In other words,
give us a taxonomy of sickness.

155
00:10:07.470 --> 00:10:11.280
Most people would say,
well,
okay,
those infectious diseases,
that's column one,

156
00:10:13.170 --> 00:10:14.220
communicable diseases.

157
00:10:14.650 --> 00:10:19.150
Then this column two is congenital genetic diseases that we are some uh,

158
00:10:19.230 --> 00:10:22.230
some small proportion of us are unlucky enough to inherit.

159
00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:26.580
Then con three,
there's the huge,

160
00:10:26.581 --> 00:10:31.581
the main problems of Ale House in the industrialized world and we're in today,

161
00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:37.380
namely of course the chronic progressive diseases of old age,
Alzheimer's,
cancer,

162
00:10:37.530 --> 00:10:42.270
Atherosclerosis,
those are the big diseases these days.

163
00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:47.010
And then most people would say that why out here in the scratch there somewhere

164
00:10:47.011 --> 00:10:50.640
there is this other force completely different thing,

165
00:10:50.790 --> 00:10:54.060
which is not like diseases at all.
This thing called aging itself,

166
00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:56.460
which consists of these rather nebulous,
you know,

167
00:10:56.461 --> 00:11:00.600
rather than nonspecific phenomena like frailty and you know,
Sarcopenia,

168
00:11:00.601 --> 00:11:04.500
which means the loss of muscle as we get older and immunosenescence the decline

169
00:11:04.501 --> 00:11:08.910
in function of the immune system.
And most people will just fail.

170
00:11:08.911 --> 00:11:12.600
But these are things are so different from diseases that we might as well not

171
00:11:12.601 --> 00:11:16.860
even think about them in the same way at all.
You know,
that's that they kind of,

172
00:11:16.890 --> 00:11:20.700
um,
well I don't,
I mentioned earlier off limits to medicine.
Uh,
you know,

173
00:11:20.701 --> 00:11:24.210
their kind of natural and inevitable and all that kind of nonsense.

174
00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:27.030
This is what people say.
They say,
well there's the aging,

175
00:11:27.610 --> 00:11:30.120
the diseases of old age and they did different things.

176
00:11:30.450 --> 00:11:34.830
Aging is somehow universal and natural and the diseases of aging or not,

177
00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:37.980
that turns out to be completely incorrect.

178
00:11:38.550 --> 00:11:43.440
The correct way to classify how you can be sick.
It's shown here.

179
00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:48.150
All the four columns now are the same as they were on the previous table.

180
00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:51.810
But the difference is that that they black lines in a different place between

181
00:11:51.811 --> 00:11:53.830
columns two and three instead of three and four.

182
00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:59.400
And that is so as to emphasize two key points to key misconceptions and errors

183
00:12:03.220 --> 00:12:05.980
in what people normally think.

184
00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:11.520
The first error that people make that is shown by putting the black line in the

185
00:12:12.701 --> 00:12:16.930
wrong place is to think that there's some kind of fundamental distinction

186
00:12:16.931 --> 00:12:18.730
between column three and column four.

187
00:12:19.270 --> 00:12:22.750
In other words that there really are diseases of old age and then there's aging

188
00:12:22.751 --> 00:12:24.910
itself.
That's complete nonsense.

189
00:12:25.390 --> 00:12:29.470
The only difference between column three and column four is semantic.

190
00:12:29.860 --> 00:12:33.400
The column three consists of the aspects of aging that we've chosen to give

191
00:12:33.401 --> 00:12:37.870
disease like names too and Golan fork ancestor of the aspects of aging that we

192
00:12:37.871 --> 00:12:38.704
haven't.

193
00:12:38.710 --> 00:12:43.710
That is all everything in either column three or column four is a consequence of

194
00:12:44.921 --> 00:12:46.180
having been alive a long time.

195
00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:51.200
A consequence of the accumulation of an amount of damage in the body of whatever

196
00:12:51.551 --> 00:12:55.360
type that exceeds what the body is set up to tolerate.

197
00:12:55.540 --> 00:12:56.650
That is all.

198
00:12:57.400 --> 00:13:02.400
The other thing that putting the black line in the wrong place causes people to

199
00:13:02.470 --> 00:13:03.880
think which is wrong,

200
00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:09.300
is to think that column three is rather like column one if you put the black

201
00:13:11.171 --> 00:13:12.310
line in the wrong place,

202
00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:17.080
then your girl look for cures to things in column three.

203
00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:21.130
Ways to eliminate them from the body in very much the same way that you might

204
00:13:21.131 --> 00:13:25.090
eliminate tuberculosis infections or whatever.
And that again,

205
00:13:25.150 --> 00:13:30.150
it all this they complete nonsense when you remember that the things in column

206
00:13:30.161 --> 00:13:34.930
three or side effects of being alive.
So basically this is the route.

207
00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:36.910
When you make that mistake,

208
00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:40.660
you go after the pathologies of old age directly.

209
00:13:40.661 --> 00:13:45.661
You try to eliminate them from the body by effectively attenuating the right

210
00:13:45.991 --> 00:13:50.991
hand Arrow trying to stop the pathologies of old age from happening even despite

211
00:13:52.181 --> 00:13:54.610
the fact that the things that are causing them,

212
00:13:54.611 --> 00:13:59.611
namely the damage that's continuing to accumulate is talking me lighting and

213
00:14:00.131 --> 00:14:02.920
it's complete nonsense.
It's obviously complete nonsense.

214
00:14:02.921 --> 00:14:07.750
There's no way in the world that this could ever work because at the end of the

215
00:14:07.750 --> 00:14:09.940
day,
if the damage is continuing to accumulate,

216
00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:15.120
then anything that attacks and addresses the consequences of that damage in

217
00:14:16.151 --> 00:14:20.800
bound to become progressively less effective as time passes.

218
00:14:21.070 --> 00:14:24.880
It's just,
it's a complete misconception.
It's a category error.

219
00:14:25.660 --> 00:14:30.660
And yet billions and billions of dollars are spent every year doing,

220
00:14:31.841 --> 00:14:35.150
trying to do this,
trying to push,
you know,
um,

221
00:14:35.710 --> 00:14:37.060
not only medical research,

222
00:14:37.061 --> 00:14:40.500
but of course medical practice trying to actually make this happen.
It's,

223
00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:45.520
it's insane.
Now.
I'm not the first person to point this out.

224
00:14:45.850 --> 00:14:49.270
In fact,
it's been more than a hundred years now.
Excuse me.

225
00:14:50.110 --> 00:14:54.110
Since people started to realize a few people started to realize that this was a

226
00:14:54.111 --> 00:14:56.630
Mug's game,
that geriatric medicine was never going to work.

227
00:14:57.200 --> 00:15:00.740
And that's why Gerontology came from Gerontology,

228
00:15:00.741 --> 00:15:05.570
was inspired by two things.
Number one,

229
00:15:05.571 --> 00:15:09.050
the realizations of geriatric medicine was never going to work.
And number two,

230
00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:12.680
the observation that in the living world,

231
00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:16.520
we see a great deal of variation in the rate of aging,

232
00:15:17.030 --> 00:15:21.080
in the rate of accumulation of damage,
different species,
age,

233
00:15:21.110 --> 00:15:23.660
very different rights,
even within a species,

234
00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:26.690
different individuals age at somewhat different rights.

235
00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:30.320
So the idea was while if we studied this really,
really,
really hard,

236
00:15:30.410 --> 00:15:35.000
then maybe we'll eventually figure out enough about how metabolism generates

237
00:15:35.001 --> 00:15:38.090
damage that we will be able to slow it down.

238
00:15:38.180 --> 00:15:42.230
We'll be able to develop therapies that will somehow clean up our metabolism so

239
00:15:42.231 --> 00:15:44.480
that it generates damage more slowly.

240
00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:48.800
And thereby we postpone the age at which the damage reaches the intolerable

241
00:15:48.801 --> 00:15:53.510
level and pathology emerges.
Great idea.
In principle,
you may,

242
00:15:53.511 --> 00:15:53.991
however,

243
00:15:53.991 --> 00:15:58.580
have noticed that Gerontology has not delivered the cure to aging and he wasn't.

244
00:15:58.581 --> 00:16:02.570
Geriatric medicine has,
and this is why metabolism is rather complicated.

245
00:16:03.670 --> 00:16:07.760
It,
I'm speaking to a bunch of coders here,
I can immediately just say,
well,
okay,

246
00:16:07.761 --> 00:16:09.830
this is obviously the um,
you know,

247
00:16:09.831 --> 00:16:14.780
the ultimate nightmare of uncomment it spaghetti code,
right?
This is just,

248
00:16:14.781 --> 00:16:18.830
there's no way in hell that you're ever going to be able to tweak this network

249
00:16:19.010 --> 00:16:22.970
so as to stop it from doing the thing you don't want it to do.

250
00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:27.440
Namely the creation of damage without at the same time stopping it from doing

251
00:16:27.441 --> 00:16:30.290
things you need to do to keep us alive.
It's just not going to happen.

252
00:16:30.291 --> 00:16:33.680
Unintended consequences are going to happen.
So,
you know,

253
00:16:33.830 --> 00:16:37.120
waste of time and unfortunately,
you know,

254
00:16:37.130 --> 00:16:41.510
it took a while for Gerontologists to realize this,
but eventually they did.

255
00:16:41.511 --> 00:16:46.490
I wouldn't say that by the 1970s it was pretty much established within the field

256
00:16:46.491 --> 00:16:50.090
of the biology of aging that we were just not going to be able to get this

257
00:16:50.091 --> 00:16:50.924
approach to work.

258
00:16:51.860 --> 00:16:55.160
And so actually it went all the way to,

259
00:16:55.161 --> 00:17:00.161
I mean like it became unacceptable even to talk about interventions in aging and

260
00:17:00.861 --> 00:17:04.180
the grant application aging became this phenomenon,
this,

261
00:17:04.190 --> 00:17:07.310
this field like you know seismology it was like,
you know,

262
00:17:07.550 --> 00:17:10.160
people who study earthquakes,
they understand that um,

263
00:17:10.250 --> 00:17:15.250
you know what they study is bad for you but they have no actual aspiration to

264
00:17:15.261 --> 00:17:18.650
doing anything about them.
You know,
it's all about getting out of the way.
Um,

265
00:17:19.080 --> 00:17:19.461
all right.

266
00:17:19.461 --> 00:17:24.461
But the thing is the wisdom bit of an oversight in all of this and the oversight

267
00:17:26.420 --> 00:17:30.470
was that there's a third perfectly respectable approach to dealing with this

268
00:17:30.471 --> 00:17:33.570
problem,
which is what I'm going to call the maintenance approach.
Oh,

269
00:17:33.630 --> 00:17:38.630
he forgot the damage repair approach and I'm trying to depict it using the same

270
00:17:39.351 --> 00:17:40.184
diagram.

271
00:17:40.370 --> 00:17:45.370
Essentially what we have is the goal is to weaken the link between metabolism

272
00:17:45.801 --> 00:17:50.801
and pathology and the geriatrics approach to do that is to weaken the righthand

273
00:17:51.031 --> 00:17:55.350
component of that process.
The the,
the link between damaging pathology,

274
00:17:55.620 --> 00:17:58.050
the gerontology approaches to weaken the lefthand side,

275
00:17:58.051 --> 00:18:00.540
the link between metabolism and damage,

276
00:18:01.700 --> 00:18:04.120
but we don't have to do either of those.
Well,

277
00:18:04.121 --> 00:18:07.230
we can do instead is go in and periodically repair the damage.

278
00:18:08.130 --> 00:18:12.420
And of course what that means is that we can leave metabolism alone,

279
00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:17.720
we can let metabolism generate damage at the natural rates and still it won't

280
00:18:18.601 --> 00:18:23.601
reach the level of abundance that causes pathologist to a Merck.

281
00:18:25.770 --> 00:18:29.580
So this is a fantastic way of doing what engineers do,

282
00:18:29.790 --> 00:18:34.790
of sidestepping our ignorance of figuring out how to manipulate the system

283
00:18:34.950 --> 00:18:38.190
without actually understanding it particularly well.

284
00:18:39.510 --> 00:18:43.770
If we're not proposing to do anything about the rate at which damage is created,

285
00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:48.480
it's fine that we have such a pitiful understanding of what metabolism actually

286
00:18:48.481 --> 00:18:52.020
does and how damage is created.
Similarly,

287
00:18:52.260 --> 00:18:56.940
if we're not proposing to let damage reach a level of abundance that causes

288
00:18:56.941 --> 00:18:58.350
pathologists to occur,

289
00:18:58.650 --> 00:19:03.360
it's fine that we don't have much understanding of the details of how those

290
00:19:03.361 --> 00:19:07.170
pathologies arise from that damage and all of the interactions between the

291
00:19:07.171 --> 00:19:09.870
pathologist.
So I mentioned at the beginning,
it's fine.

292
00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:14.220
We can just separate the two things from each other and

293
00:19:15.780 --> 00:19:17.850
it's not just common sense to you and me.

294
00:19:17.970 --> 00:19:22.650
It's common sense to people in general if you think about it because hello.
Okay.

295
00:19:22.830 --> 00:19:25.290
Um,
right,
because we already do it.

296
00:19:25.380 --> 00:19:28.830
Remember what I said at the beginning that aging is a phenomenon of physics,

297
00:19:28.831 --> 00:19:32.130
not biology.
Well,
it's a bit of physics for you.

298
00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:37.280
Here's a car that is more than a hundred years old and it wasn't built that way.

299
00:19:37.980 --> 00:19:40.100
The people who build this car a hundred years ago,

300
00:19:40.110 --> 00:19:44.820
what has been astonished at the idea that any of the cars they were building

301
00:19:44.821 --> 00:19:47.550
would last that long.
They were built to last maybe 10 years,

302
00:19:48.030 --> 00:19:52.890
but it turns out house.
But we know how,
because cars are fairly simple.

303
00:19:52.891 --> 00:19:57.850
We know how to do sufficiently comprehensive maintenance on cards.
Oh,

304
00:19:58.200 --> 00:19:59.033
excuse me,

305
00:19:59.310 --> 00:20:03.420
that we can keep them going just as well as when they were built.

306
00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:07.590
And now that we've got this hundred year old car,
there is nobody who would say,

307
00:20:07.591 --> 00:20:09.960
oh dear,
you know,
well we've got them out to a hundred years,

308
00:20:09.961 --> 00:20:12.690
but there's no way we're going to get them to 200 that's not going to happen is

309
00:20:12.691 --> 00:20:15.630
it?
Everybody knows that we can push this out as long as we like now.

310
00:20:16.020 --> 00:20:21.020
So it's completely obvious from any to anyone who takes aging seriously and

311
00:20:22.651 --> 00:20:25.170
doesn't actually regard it as some kind of enigma,

312
00:20:25.171 --> 00:20:28.200
some kind of magic that we know what we,

313
00:20:28.530 --> 00:20:32.580
this is what we should do to actually fix aging.
So,
you know,
I say this,

314
00:20:32.581 --> 00:20:34.350
I said at the end of the day,

315
00:20:34.351 --> 00:20:37.650
the only reason that I have to go around the world giving the bloody talks still

316
00:20:37.770 --> 00:20:42.240
after all these years is because people don't want to hear this message.

317
00:20:42.990 --> 00:20:47.990
It's been a long time since we realize that aging was actually rather horrible.

318
00:20:49.390 --> 00:20:51.130
You know,
since the dawn of civilization,

319
00:20:51.131 --> 00:20:55.480
people have had this dream of actually finding some way to maintain youth in old

320
00:20:55.481 --> 00:20:57.370
age and we haven't done very well.

321
00:20:57.371 --> 00:21:01.240
And the problem is of course there's a lot of people have been out there saying,

322
00:21:01.270 --> 00:21:04.150
oh,
this is the solution and they've always been wrong.

323
00:21:04.450 --> 00:21:08.710
So humanity has been suckered rather often,
which means of course,

324
00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:12.670
that there is a great deal of reluctance to get one's hopes up.
Now,
you know,

325
00:21:12.671 --> 00:21:14.770
to actually get into a mindset of saying,
well,

326
00:21:14.771 --> 00:21:17.650
maybe this time it's actually going to be true.
People.

327
00:21:17.651 --> 00:21:20.080
Instead they go the opposite way.
They say,
well,
okay,

328
00:21:20.081 --> 00:21:24.180
let's just believe that aging really is a complete inevitability that's kind of

329
00:21:24.190 --> 00:21:27.880
make up peace with it and resign ourselves and get on with our miserably short

330
00:21:27.881 --> 00:21:32.080
lives and make the best of it rather than being constantly preoccupied by this

331
00:21:32.081 --> 00:21:33.340
terrible thing that's going to happen.

332
00:21:33.730 --> 00:21:38.730
So of course the way we do that overwhelmingly is by making up these fantasies

333
00:21:39.250 --> 00:21:43.720
that pretend that it's a blessing in disguise.

334
00:21:43.930 --> 00:21:47.500
You know that it's that there's some kind of good thing about aging.

335
00:21:47.860 --> 00:21:52.860
I call it the pro aging trance because it's a bit like being hypnotized.

336
00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:56.560
You know,
I went when I was a kid,
I went to,
when I was a student at Cambridge,

337
00:21:56.561 --> 00:22:01.561
I went to a stage hypnotist show in which the hypnotist got a guy on stage and

338
00:22:03.490 --> 00:22:07.420
told him,
this is actually your right elbow,
this is your last Alba.
Okay,

339
00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:08.291
that's what they said.

340
00:22:08.291 --> 00:22:11.740
Then he just got the guy who completely understand and believe that his elbows

341
00:22:11.741 --> 00:22:14.020
were actually switched and they said,
okay,

342
00:22:14.021 --> 00:22:18.970
please touch your right elbow with your left forefinger under with a whole lot

343
00:22:18.971 --> 00:22:21.580
of rising and wriggling as you can imagine.
And that was all very funny.

344
00:22:21.581 --> 00:22:26.350
But that wasn't the point of the,
um,
of the shark.

345
00:22:26.860 --> 00:22:31.690
The point we've,
what came next?
What came next was the guy says,
he says,

346
00:22:31.691 --> 00:22:36.250
okay,
you can stop now.
And the guy stops and it was just says,
right,

347
00:22:36.251 --> 00:22:39.400
you couldn't do it good,
you.
And the Guy Says No.
And then the hit as he says,

348
00:22:39.550 --> 00:22:40.630
why not?

349
00:22:41.380 --> 00:22:44.820
And what happens then is absolutely breast tech.

350
00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:49.120
What happens without fail is that the subject,

351
00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:52.930
we'll get the completely unhesitating lucid,

352
00:22:53.500 --> 00:22:56.140
coherent grammatical answer to the question.

353
00:22:56.141 --> 00:23:00.310
He will explain why he couldn't touch his left elbow with his right fourth

354
00:23:00.311 --> 00:23:03.850
finger.
And of course the actual explanation,
we'll have a hole in it,

355
00:23:03.851 --> 00:23:07.750
the size of Canada,
you know,
there will be absolutely no rationality.

356
00:23:07.751 --> 00:23:09.160
So the answer whatsoever.

357
00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:11.740
So everybody will fall about and it will be terribly amusing,

358
00:23:12.100 --> 00:23:17.100
but the fact is the subject won't have a clue what's wrong with what they're

359
00:23:17.981 --> 00:23:21.370
saying.
This was,
I mean this was at the University of Cambridge,
right?

360
00:23:21.371 --> 00:23:23.560
A bunch of undergraduates with very high,
you know,

361
00:23:23.740 --> 00:23:25.420
academic achievements and everything like that.

362
00:23:25.421 --> 00:23:29.940
And I attended their own intellect and their own rationality and the guy says

363
00:23:29.941 --> 00:23:34.941
sitting there with all his friends cackling in and he just doesn't have a clue

364
00:23:35.921 --> 00:23:39.190
what he's saying wrong.
So it's,
to me it's exactly like that.
You know,

365
00:23:39.250 --> 00:23:42.610
it's unbelievable.
So

366
00:23:44.770 --> 00:23:49.770
I realized that at this point all I've done is told you what's the common sense

367
00:23:50.331 --> 00:23:55.331
approach to tackling aging well I haven't done is give you a feel for how

368
00:23:56.541 --> 00:23:59.860
difficult it actually is.
Even if it's the common sense approach,

369
00:23:59.861 --> 00:24:03.560
it got the author the hard right and therefore not really worth,

370
00:24:03.940 --> 00:24:07.150
I'm going to go into optimistic about yet though.

371
00:24:07.151 --> 00:24:09.410
That's what I need to address next.
I need to actually tell you,

372
00:24:09.770 --> 00:24:13.580
I've told you that were side stepping.
Our ignorance of metabolism.
Wonderful.

373
00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:17.000
And we're also sidestepping our ignorance and pathology also.
Wonderful.

374
00:24:17.210 --> 00:24:20.750
But what we're definitely not sidestepping is the complexity of the damage

375
00:24:20.751 --> 00:24:21.584
itself.

376
00:24:21.590 --> 00:24:26.420
We absolutely can't implement this maintenance approach unless we can

377
00:24:26.421 --> 00:24:31.421
characterize what that damage is and figure out ways to repair it to eliminate

378
00:24:32.721 --> 00:24:36.350
the damage and restore the structure and composition of the body at the

379
00:24:36.351 --> 00:24:40.040
molecular and cellular level to something like how it was at a younger age

380
00:24:40.050 --> 00:24:43.400
because that's what this is all about.
So can we actually do that?
Well,

381
00:24:43.580 --> 00:24:45.890
this is really where the good news begins.

382
00:24:48.020 --> 00:24:50.540
17 years ago when I first started thinking about this,

383
00:24:50.570 --> 00:24:53.070
I think about the problem in this way.
Um,

384
00:24:53.270 --> 00:24:58.270
the only reason why I felt optimistic was because I was able to derive a rather

385
00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:04.790
concise taxonomy classification of damage.

386
00:25:05.150 --> 00:25:09.530
So that's what we have on the left hand side of this table and all the seven

387
00:25:09.531 --> 00:25:12.020
things you see there.
Uh,
as you can see,

388
00:25:12.021 --> 00:25:17.000
very clear concrete down to earth,
real biological phenomenon,
solar,

389
00:25:17.030 --> 00:25:17.391
what's that?

390
00:25:17.391 --> 00:25:22.391
It's just the case of cells dying and not being automatically replaced by the

391
00:25:24.981 --> 00:25:27.080
division and differentiation of other cells.

392
00:25:27.260 --> 00:25:30.260
So of course if that happens then progressive with the number of cells in the

393
00:25:30.261 --> 00:25:33.740
effect of dog and will decline and eventually you'll end up with not enough

394
00:25:33.741 --> 00:25:35.840
cells for the organ to be able to do its job.

395
00:25:36.320 --> 00:25:41.320
An example of an aspect of aging that is mainly driven by that type of damage is

396
00:25:42.201 --> 00:25:43.310
Parkinson's disease.

397
00:25:44.210 --> 00:25:47.500
Blake is mainly caused by the loss of a particular type of neuron called a

398
00:25:47.510 --> 00:25:51.110
dopaminergic neuron in a particular part of the brain called the substantia

399
00:25:51.111 --> 00:25:54.290
Nigra.
And sure enough,
um,
you know,

400
00:25:54.350 --> 00:25:57.650
that's bad for you and it happens a little faster in some people than others.

401
00:25:57.800 --> 00:26:00.290
And that's why some people get Parkinson's and some people don't.

402
00:26:00.560 --> 00:26:05.180
But all of us have lost at least a quarter of our dopaminergic neurons that we

403
00:26:05.181 --> 00:26:07.370
had as young adults.
By all day.

404
00:26:07.610 --> 00:26:11.780
So it's a general phenomenon and I could go down the list.

405
00:26:11.781 --> 00:26:15.500
I want to do that now.
I'll address one or two of these later on in other ways,

406
00:26:15.501 --> 00:26:18.200
but basically send deal all the way down.

407
00:26:19.610 --> 00:26:23.060
The good news of course is not just that we can do this classification,

408
00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:26.600
but that we can write the right hand side of this table.

409
00:26:26.900 --> 00:26:31.900
The purpose of the classification is precisely because for each of the

410
00:26:32.391 --> 00:26:37.391
categories there is a generic approach to actually eliminating the damage to

411
00:26:37.821 --> 00:26:42.110
fixing the problem.
The um,
you know,

412
00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:43.220
when I say generic,

413
00:26:43.230 --> 00:26:48.230
what I mean is that the world's definitely be differences at the details of how

414
00:26:49.861 --> 00:26:54.780
we use this generic approach to address different examples within a given

415
00:26:54.781 --> 00:26:58.650
category,
but only the details.
So if we look at cell loss,

416
00:26:58.651 --> 00:27:02.430
of course you already know what the fix is.
It's called stem cell therapy.

417
00:27:02.610 --> 00:27:05.340
That's exactly what stem cell therapy is.
We simply procure,

418
00:27:05.760 --> 00:27:10.760
prepare preprogram if you like cells in the lab into the right state so that

419
00:27:10.801 --> 00:27:13.530
when we inject them into the body,
they know what to do.

420
00:27:13.531 --> 00:27:18.000
They know how to defer that to divide and differentiate to replace the cells

421
00:27:18.001 --> 00:27:21.860
that the body is not replacing on its own.
Uh,
Parkinson's disease.

422
00:27:21.870 --> 00:27:26.650
Coming back to that,
um,
you know,
that's exactly what's being done now.
Uh,

423
00:27:26.700 --> 00:27:31.560
the first time this was attempted was 20 odd years ago and we were hopeless back

424
00:27:31.561 --> 00:27:34.260
then at the pre programming staff.

425
00:27:34.290 --> 00:27:38.130
We didn't know what to do to get stem cells into the right state before we

426
00:27:38.131 --> 00:27:41.150
injected them.
And sure enough,
the um,

427
00:27:41.270 --> 00:27:45.930
the process only gave any real benefit.
I'm very occasionally,

428
00:27:45.931 --> 00:27:47.190
most people didn't benefit,

429
00:27:47.430 --> 00:27:50.730
but the ones who did benefit didn't just benefit a little bit.

430
00:27:50.850 --> 00:27:55.140
They will completely cured.
Just last year there was a paper that came out,
um,

431
00:27:55.170 --> 00:27:59.280
celebrating the 25th anniversary of the first successful,
the first,

432
00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:02.700
the first real responder of the first clinical trial in this area.

433
00:28:03.590 --> 00:28:07.260
And this is the guy who was taken off all the other medications for Parkinson's

434
00:28:07.261 --> 00:28:09.450
after a couple of years as had no,

435
00:28:09.630 --> 00:28:12.450
no subsequent stem cell treatments or anything,

436
00:28:13.290 --> 00:28:16.950
no Parkinson's disease,
25 years.
So this is real.

437
00:28:17.130 --> 00:28:20.790
And now that we're much better at the pre programming,
if stem cells in the lab,

438
00:28:21.060 --> 00:28:24.630
people are very much more confident that we can actually do this reproducibly

439
00:28:24.631 --> 00:28:24.840
now.

440
00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:28.980
So there are quite a lot of different clinical trials against Parkinson's that

441
00:28:28.981 --> 00:28:33.270
are actually just getting going now or in,
in preparation.
Um,
and you know,

442
00:28:33.271 --> 00:28:34.260
there's a lot of optimism.

443
00:28:34.620 --> 00:28:38.550
So that's the kind of thing that we can expect when we really repair damage.

444
00:28:39.150 --> 00:28:43.250
Now you may ask yourself,
well,
okay,
well stem cell therapy is,
you know,

445
00:28:43.260 --> 00:28:44.580
very well respected area.

446
00:28:44.600 --> 00:28:47.250
The right work is being done is already moving through to clinical trials.

447
00:28:47.251 --> 00:28:51.810
Why did Aubrey de grey feel it's necessary to go around the world giving all

448
00:28:51.811 --> 00:28:54.180
these talks and drumming up,
enthusiasm and so on.

449
00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:58.380
And the answer is because the other six categories aren't telling you about
here.

450
00:28:58.540 --> 00:29:02.130
Um,
March,
much less well appreciated.

451
00:29:02.820 --> 00:29:04.890
That's why sensory research foundation exists.
In fact,

452
00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:10.470
we exist because all of the other categories are just as important to cell loss.

453
00:29:10.740 --> 00:29:15.090
But yet the ways to fix them,
uh,
either just,
you know,

454
00:29:15.091 --> 00:29:19.170
hardly anyone understands that they could actually happen at all or else,

455
00:29:19.230 --> 00:29:21.720
you know,
they're just not understood well enough.

456
00:29:22.350 --> 00:29:24.810
They're not appreciated how important they are or whatever.

457
00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:30.200
So we spent a lot of athletes and a lot of money trying to develop these things

458
00:29:31.110 --> 00:29:33.660
at the early stage,
proof of concept level.

459
00:29:33.870 --> 00:29:37.410
So as we can get them to the point where the rest of society and the rest of the

460
00:29:37.411 --> 00:29:41.530
research community takes them seriously.
Now I won't draw your attention.

461
00:29:41.531 --> 00:29:42.550
Before I go to the next slide,

462
00:29:42.551 --> 00:29:45.940
I want to draw your attention to the bottom line here because you may be

463
00:29:45.941 --> 00:29:47.380
thinking to yourself,
well hang on,

464
00:29:47.800 --> 00:29:52.800
how does Aubrey know that this really isn't exhaustive classification and that

465
00:29:53.621 --> 00:29:56.710
there isn't some category number eight and number nine that's been overlooked.

466
00:29:57.100 --> 00:30:01.030
And of course it's a very important question and we definitely cannot say that

467
00:30:01.031 --> 00:30:06.031
we are 100% know that there are no further categories we've been looking,

468
00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:09.880
that's for sure.
And more than that,

469
00:30:10.630 --> 00:30:13.000
I've been going out there and making trouble,
you know,

470
00:30:13.001 --> 00:30:15.100
generally making a nuisance of myself.
I'm getting,

471
00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:19.150
I'm encouraging my colleagues to come up with things that break this

472
00:30:19.151 --> 00:30:22.420
classification,
things that fall outside of it.
And you know what,

473
00:30:22.421 --> 00:30:25.510
I'm getting away with it.
I've been doing it for a long time now.

474
00:30:25.660 --> 00:30:28.870
So of course that's only circumstantial evidence but it's really quite strong

475
00:30:28.871 --> 00:30:33.460
circumstantial evidence that um,
that we seem to be on the right lines.

476
00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:38.280
Not only that,
the approach is on the right hand side of this table,

477
00:30:38.281 --> 00:30:43.281
all the various repair methodologies that we are focused on.

478
00:30:43.420 --> 00:30:46.480
I've also not had to change over the past 15 years.

479
00:30:46.750 --> 00:30:50.140
We have been pursuing them of course.
And some of them have,

480
00:30:50.640 --> 00:30:55.000
we've made progress in all of them and some of them have become easier as a

481
00:30:55.001 --> 00:30:59.590
result of Nice surprises like the development of new technologies like CRISPR

482
00:30:59.591 --> 00:31:03.750
and induced pluripotent stem cells that have um,

483
00:31:03.970 --> 00:31:06.580
shorten the timeline to development of these things.

484
00:31:06.850 --> 00:31:11.850
But there have been no examples of bad surprises of cases where we find that

485
00:31:12.161 --> 00:31:15.580
they saw that approach is not going to work because of this or that new

486
00:31:15.581 --> 00:31:17.980
discovery.
So that's again,
really good news.

487
00:31:18.700 --> 00:31:22.480
I'm going to give you a little bit of a feel for this at the level of the actual

488
00:31:22.481 --> 00:31:24.670
bench work now and as I mentioned earlier,

489
00:31:24.671 --> 00:31:27.340
of course they're not biologists so I don't want to get too heavy,

490
00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:31.030
but I do want to make sure that you understand I'm not totally bullshitting you.

491
00:31:31.300 --> 00:31:35.890
So,
um,
so let me talk a little bit about atherosclerosis.

492
00:31:36.390 --> 00:31:40.390
Storage is of course is the number one killer in the western world and it

493
00:31:40.391 --> 00:31:45.391
consists of the accumulation of fatty deposits in our major arteries which grow

494
00:31:45.821 --> 00:31:49.030
and grow and eventually burst and cause heart attacks and strokes.

495
00:31:49.420 --> 00:31:52.720
So we'd like that not to happen,
that's for sure.
Now,

496
00:31:52.750 --> 00:31:56.710
the beginning of atherosclerosis is depicted on this slide here.

497
00:31:56.711 --> 00:32:01.711
This is a micrograph of parts of a cell called a foam cell to one of the from

498
00:32:02.511 --> 00:32:06.520
cell phone.
So it's a cell that used to be a perfectly healthy,

499
00:32:06.521 --> 00:32:08.980
self-respecting white blood cell or macrophage.

500
00:32:09.460 --> 00:32:14.460
That macrophage went into the artery wall with the goal of cleaning up detritus

501
00:32:15.551 --> 00:32:18.250
that we're stuck there,
which just,
you know,
it just happens.
That's what,

502
00:32:18.251 --> 00:32:20.980
that's one thing that macrophages do.
They're very good at it.

503
00:32:21.910 --> 00:32:25.840
The detritus is mostly made of cholesterol.
It turns out,

504
00:32:26.170 --> 00:32:29.860
and cholesterol,
you know,
gets a bad rap,
but it's a vital molecule.

505
00:32:29.861 --> 00:32:34.360
The body needs a lot of it and macrophages know exactly what to do with

506
00:32:34.361 --> 00:32:34.961
cholesterol.

507
00:32:34.961 --> 00:32:38.740
They know how to reprocess and repackage it and export it so that it can be

508
00:32:38.750 --> 00:32:40.700
reused.
That's all wonderful.

509
00:32:41.240 --> 00:32:46.240
But unfortunately there is a small concentration of contaminant within this

510
00:32:47.721 --> 00:32:50.330
detritus.
Most of that contaminant,

511
00:32:50.331 --> 00:32:54.250
the master's is actually oxidation derivatives,
chemical changes,

512
00:32:54.320 --> 00:32:58.810
chemically altered cholesterol that has become um,

513
00:32:59.510 --> 00:33:04.510
clinically different and in various ways not amenable to processing by the

514
00:33:05.421 --> 00:33:09.710
macrophage.
So instead of processing the macrophage,
processing the cholesterol,

515
00:33:09.920 --> 00:33:13.970
this oxidized cholesterol poisons the macrophage and it gets like this,

516
00:33:14.330 --> 00:33:16.250
the lysosomes,
this part of the cell,

517
00:33:16.251 --> 00:33:20.000
which is very important in this processing business.

518
00:33:20.510 --> 00:33:23.240
It becomes full of fat basically.

519
00:33:23.480 --> 00:33:26.390
And then the rest of the self fell up with these globules of fat,

520
00:33:26.391 --> 00:33:31.100
you can see them.
So that's the beginning of atherosclerosis from sales happen.

521
00:33:31.460 --> 00:33:34.360
They get more and more of them.
They be that,

522
00:33:34.410 --> 00:33:39.230
they start to basically get angry and the south around them get angry and more

523
00:33:39.231 --> 00:33:42.470
macrophages come in to solve the problem,
but they can't.

524
00:33:42.471 --> 00:33:46.790
So they become part of the problem.
And that's how atherosclerosis progressive.

525
00:33:47.300 --> 00:33:52.130
So what can we do about this?
Well,
of course people have tried a bunch of stuff.

526
00:33:52.790 --> 00:33:54.410
One approach is surgery.

527
00:33:54.620 --> 00:33:59.510
Go in and ream out these arteries and try and get rid of this fatty stuff so

528
00:33:59.511 --> 00:34:03.470
that it doesn't accumulate enough to,
uh,
to burst and courthouse stack.

529
00:34:03.800 --> 00:34:06.980
And that's,
you know,
pretty crude really.
And it doesn't work terribly well.

530
00:34:07.910 --> 00:34:10.070
The other alternatives that people have tried a lot,

531
00:34:10.220 --> 00:34:15.220
it's statens startings of drugs which reduce the rate at which the body

532
00:34:16.020 --> 00:34:18.050
synthesizes cholesterol.

533
00:34:18.560 --> 00:34:21.560
And that kind of makes sense if you do that.

534
00:34:21.860 --> 00:34:23.510
If you reduce the amount of cholesterol,

535
00:34:23.511 --> 00:34:26.060
you're going to reduce the amount of oxidized cholesterol.

536
00:34:26.061 --> 00:34:30.470
So you're going to slow down the,
um,
the poisoning of macrophages.

537
00:34:30.770 --> 00:34:32.780
But,
and I mentioned earlier,
cholesterol,

538
00:34:32.781 --> 00:34:35.600
these are rather important molecule we can't do without it.

539
00:34:35.870 --> 00:34:39.520
So that only so much that you can push that kind of,
um,

540
00:34:39.780 --> 00:34:42.740
Abrook and sure enough starting to have bad side effects.

541
00:34:45.070 --> 00:34:48.050
What do we actually want to do?
Common Sense again,

542
00:34:48.290 --> 00:34:53.210
what we actually want to do is go after the actual problematic reagent,

543
00:34:53.211 --> 00:34:55.910
which is the oxidized cholesterol.

544
00:34:56.630 --> 00:35:01.630
And in particular what we might like to do is give our macrophages the enhanced

545
00:35:02.991 --> 00:35:05.730
ability to break down oxidized cholesterol.

546
00:35:05.731 --> 00:35:09.740
They'll process it in just the same way that they can naturally process normal

547
00:35:09.741 --> 00:35:13.640
cholesterol.
If we could give them an extra enzyme,
for example,

548
00:35:13.880 --> 00:35:17.870
that just allowed them to degrade oxidized cholesterol,

549
00:35:18.170 --> 00:35:20.840
then bang,
you know,
they wouldn't be poisoned by it anymore.

550
00:35:21.320 --> 00:35:25.700
So that's exactly what we set out to do more than 10 years ago now.
Um,

551
00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:26.510
we,

552
00:35:26.510 --> 00:35:31.510
we decided to find another species which already had an enzyme to break down

553
00:35:31.850 --> 00:35:33.080
oxidized cholesterol.

554
00:35:33.460 --> 00:35:37.470
It turns out that it's fairly straightforward to find bacteria that can break

555
00:35:37.471 --> 00:35:40.880
down more or less anything you like as long as it's organic.
And,

556
00:35:41.310 --> 00:35:45.990
and this has actually become a really important,
um,
commercial,

557
00:35:46.140 --> 00:35:49.560
um,
uh,
and other,
it's called bio remediation.

558
00:35:49.680 --> 00:35:51.570
This of course he's not a biomedical thing.

559
00:35:51.870 --> 00:35:55.080
This is for environmental decontamination.

560
00:35:55.310 --> 00:35:59.160
Do you find bacteria that can break down t and t for example?

561
00:35:59.340 --> 00:36:04.110
Then you can just spray them over with our field that you want to build a

562
00:36:04.111 --> 00:36:07.320
housing estate on and the t and t is going to go away and you'll be able to

563
00:36:07.321 --> 00:36:11.880
build your housing estate.
This actually is done in the real world,
so great.

564
00:36:12.300 --> 00:36:16.890
But our goal is not to spray bacteria into the body because that might have side

565
00:36:16.891 --> 00:36:20.970
effects.
And our goal is to find these bacteria,

566
00:36:20.971 --> 00:36:24.180
but then to identify the genes,

567
00:36:24.181 --> 00:36:29.181
the enzymes that they have to allow them to break down this toxic molecule and

568
00:36:30.391 --> 00:36:35.391
then put that gene into human cells modified in such a way that it still works

569
00:36:36.240 --> 00:36:40.950
despite the various structural differences that exist between bacteria and

570
00:36:40.951 --> 00:36:43.350
mammalian cells.
And he turned out to work.

571
00:36:43.620 --> 00:36:47.730
So step one is pretty easy finding the bacteria.
Step two is also pretty easy.

572
00:36:47.731 --> 00:36:49.450
Finding the genes that the bacteria have,

573
00:36:49.451 --> 00:36:53.100
the give them the capacity to break down the stuff is that three isn't actually

574
00:36:53.101 --> 00:36:57.030
really hard tweaking the Jane so that it still works in human cells.

575
00:36:57.060 --> 00:36:58.620
But we managed it for years ago.

576
00:36:59.520 --> 00:37:02.340
This is the key figure from the paper where we um,

577
00:37:02.520 --> 00:37:03.870
where we reported this success.

578
00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:09.320
Essentially what we're saying here is each group of bars is a different

579
00:37:09.751 --> 00:37:14.070
concentration of the toxic molecule.
Seven Quito cholesterol,

580
00:37:14.220 --> 00:37:16.470
which is a particular type of oxidized cholesterol.

581
00:37:17.160 --> 00:37:22.160
And within each group what you've got is the right hand bar is our engineered

582
00:37:22.891 --> 00:37:27.780
cells and all the others are what are called negative controls.
So for example,

583
00:37:27.781 --> 00:37:31.380
self that don't have the enzyme or they've got the wrong enzyme or they've got

584
00:37:31.381 --> 00:37:34.500
the right enzyme but it's not been modified so that it goes to the right part of

585
00:37:34.501 --> 00:37:35.670
the sale,
for example.

586
00:37:36.090 --> 00:37:40.410
And the height of the bar is simply the health of the cells,
the viability.

587
00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:46.280
So the fact that the right hand bar in each of the groups is taller than the

588
00:37:48.061 --> 00:37:53.061
ones to its left that tells you that for each of these various concentrations of

589
00:37:53.490 --> 00:37:54.323
the toxin,

590
00:37:54.510 --> 00:37:58.620
we are protecting the cells by introducing this gene.

591
00:37:59.160 --> 00:38:03.090
And this is of course quite promising results and it's being taken forward now

592
00:38:03.091 --> 00:38:04.380
into mouse models.

593
00:38:04.381 --> 00:38:09.381
And we would hope that this will be a much more effective approach to stopping

594
00:38:10.021 --> 00:38:14.160
people from getting heart attacks and strokes than anything that's around today.

595
00:38:15.150 --> 00:38:18.450
So I'm going to address a few things that you might be thinking.

596
00:38:21.060 --> 00:38:22.650
So first of all,
um,

597
00:38:22.770 --> 00:38:26.670
some of you may have come across my work before actually hands up,
hands up.

598
00:38:26.671 --> 00:38:29.700
Anyone who's actually seen the talk of what I've given him the pastor.
Right.

599
00:38:29.730 --> 00:38:33.090
Can I get to the good [inaudible] all right.
Um,

600
00:38:33.630 --> 00:38:37.330
so some of you might know that when I first started putting these ideas out

601
00:38:37.331 --> 00:38:41.960
there,
a lot of people didn't think much of them.
A lot of paypal gave.
Um,

602
00:38:42.250 --> 00:38:45.190
we're,
we're quite,
we're quite derogatory.
Um,

603
00:38:45.250 --> 00:38:49.660
and that's kind of no surprise because the fact is,

604
00:38:49.661 --> 00:38:51.160
as I've already emphasized,

605
00:38:51.520 --> 00:38:56.520
I was bringing together a lot of new ideas that had never been brought into

606
00:38:59.230 --> 00:39:01.300
gerontology before.
In fact,

607
00:39:01.301 --> 00:39:04.360
you've just seen one which would never be even be brought into anything

608
00:39:04.380 --> 00:39:08.020
biomedical before it was only used for environmental decontamination.

609
00:39:08.470 --> 00:39:11.620
So there was a huge amount of education that had to occur.

610
00:39:12.070 --> 00:39:17.070
I'm sure you appreciate that sciences are very balkanized fields that people

611
00:39:17.951 --> 00:39:20.440
think they know what they need to know,
you know,

612
00:39:20.441 --> 00:39:24.700
they know that they have a particular area of expertise that they're good at and

613
00:39:24.701 --> 00:39:27.880
they think they know what's relevant to that and they won't really take the

614
00:39:27.881 --> 00:39:31.330
trouble to learn very much about things that they don't think are relevant.

615
00:39:31.600 --> 00:39:35.350
And it's pretty hard to break that down.
So it took,

616
00:39:35.440 --> 00:39:40.390
I'm going to say the best part of a decade for me to actually get my colleagues

617
00:39:40.410 --> 00:39:44.530
a predominance of my colleagues to the point where they actually understood that

618
00:39:44.531 --> 00:39:48.310
what I was saying,
we've not complete nonsense,
but it worked.

619
00:39:48.370 --> 00:39:51.430
I really did get that.
First of all,
we've published a lot,
you know,

620
00:39:51.431 --> 00:39:54.790
we've actually got a lot of papers out there in the academic literature,

621
00:39:54.791 --> 00:39:56.440
including in high profile journals,

622
00:39:56.770 --> 00:40:01.770
demonstrating key proof of concept steps towards getting these things to work.

623
00:40:02.260 --> 00:40:06.610
So that's one kind of,
you know,
um,
uh,
community recognition.

624
00:40:06.940 --> 00:40:11.290
Then we've got an advisory board consisting of a large number of extremely high

625
00:40:11.291 --> 00:40:14.530
profile world leading scientists in all the relevant areas.

626
00:40:14.800 --> 00:40:18.610
These are not the kinds of people that publicly endorsed stuff,
that bullshit.

627
00:40:18.640 --> 00:40:21.250
So this is actually quite important,

628
00:40:21.430 --> 00:40:25.690
but bud was most important of all is that the idea is being reinvented by other

629
00:40:25.691 --> 00:40:26.524
people.
Now.

630
00:40:26.680 --> 00:40:31.540
So this paper came out four years ago and it's the identical same idea.
I mean,

631
00:40:31.541 --> 00:40:35.080
they'd decided to divide it into nine categories instead of seven.

632
00:40:35.081 --> 00:40:38.740
But it's exactly a divide and conquer damage repair approach here are there

633
00:40:38.741 --> 00:40:41.960
corresponding fixes?
Their graphics are a bit better than mine were.

634
00:40:42.020 --> 00:40:45.220
But the fact is,
you know,
it's identically the same idea.

635
00:40:45.310 --> 00:40:50.310
And the difference is that this paper was written by grandees and it's being

636
00:40:51.551 --> 00:40:55.510
cited literally still,
but once every two days.

637
00:40:55.840 --> 00:41:00.310
This is probably the single most influential paper in the whole of Gerontology

638
00:41:00.311 --> 00:41:01.144
as of now,

639
00:41:01.360 --> 00:41:06.360
and it is identically the same idea that I put forward more than a decade

640
00:41:06.521 --> 00:41:08.240
previously.
Now,
you know,

641
00:41:08.260 --> 00:41:10.420
it would be nice if I were to get a bit more of the credit,

642
00:41:10.421 --> 00:41:11.980
but that's really not what bothers me.

643
00:41:11.981 --> 00:41:16.981
The fact is that this is now completely mainstream and Orthodox and any

644
00:41:19.330 --> 00:41:23.950
misapprehension that you may have as a result of the kinds of things that

645
00:41:24.310 --> 00:41:29.310
gerontologists we're often saying about these ideas 10 years ago should be

646
00:41:29.621 --> 00:41:34.621
forgotten because there are no longer saying that this has now something totally

647
00:41:35.121 --> 00:41:35.954
accepted.

648
00:41:36.410 --> 00:41:41.410
Second thing is to do with the magnitude and the proximity of this work,

649
00:41:46.910 --> 00:41:49.430
and this is something that I fell I do need to address,

650
00:41:49.431 --> 00:41:53.740
especially with an audience like this because this is something that polarizes

651
00:41:53.750 --> 00:41:54.980
opinion a huge amount.

652
00:41:55.670 --> 00:41:59.630
First thing I want to say is people get terribly exercise about the idea of

653
00:41:59.631 --> 00:42:02.660
living longer,
Bang,
Bang,
scary,
you know,

654
00:42:02.810 --> 00:42:07.810
and of course a large part of what they are basing that on is the idea that

655
00:42:08.151 --> 00:42:09.380
living a lot longer,

656
00:42:09.440 --> 00:42:14.440
my tile living a lot longer in the same state of health that we currently

657
00:42:17.001 --> 00:42:18.750
associate with Olay,

658
00:42:19.220 --> 00:42:24.110
which of course is considerably less fun than the state of health that we

659
00:42:24.111 --> 00:42:26.960
currently associated with early adulthood.

660
00:42:27.350 --> 00:42:31.520
So let me be perfectly clear,
the is zero chance,

661
00:42:31.521 --> 00:42:36.521
zero chance that any of this work will ever deliver that kind of life extension.

662
00:42:38.780 --> 00:42:43.780
The only way that we are ever going to get people living substantially longer is

663
00:42:45.531 --> 00:42:47.060
by keeping them truly,

664
00:42:47.061 --> 00:42:52.061
genuinely useful for substantially longer is always going to be risky to be

665
00:42:53.301 --> 00:42:56.300
sick.
So do not worry about that.

666
00:42:57.290 --> 00:42:59.480
The question though is how much longer,

667
00:42:59.750 --> 00:43:04.710
I mean in a why medicine always has the side effect,
right?
After all,

668
00:43:04.980 --> 00:43:09.380
most people die of being sick.
So if you can help people not to be sick,

669
00:43:09.381 --> 00:43:12.200
you're on average going to have them live longer.
Make sense?

670
00:43:12.500 --> 00:43:16.910
The question is how much longer?
And it turns out that the quite a,
so

671
00:43:18.410 --> 00:43:20.630
the therapists that I've told you about so far,

672
00:43:21.080 --> 00:43:26.080
I believe have a respectable chance of giving us an additional 30 years or so of

673
00:43:27.291 --> 00:43:32.240
extra life.
And of course,
as I'm saying,
healthy life now,
that's a lot.

674
00:43:32.300 --> 00:43:34.160
It's a lot more than what we can do today,

675
00:43:34.460 --> 00:43:39.080
but it sure isn't immortality or any of the other words that the media tend to

676
00:43:39.081 --> 00:43:43.820
like to associate with my work.
So what's the big deal?
You know,

677
00:43:44.630 --> 00:43:46.010
that's great,
but so what,

678
00:43:46.011 --> 00:43:50.150
you know people that aren't going to get second and old and dad as before,
right?

679
00:43:50.600 --> 00:43:55.600
I mean we've already extended the average lifespan by more than 30 years in the

680
00:43:56.480 --> 00:43:58.220
past hundred years.
So you know what's the big deal?

681
00:43:58.850 --> 00:44:01.940
The big deal is the thing that was called longevity escape velocity,

682
00:44:02.360 --> 00:44:06.590
which to a software engineer is a ridiculously straightforward concept.

683
00:44:07.760 --> 00:44:11.240
It certainly is that these are rejuvenation therapies.

684
00:44:11.450 --> 00:44:14.300
Therefore they will be applied to people who are already in,

685
00:44:14.301 --> 00:44:18.410
let's say middle aid,
let's say 60 or 70 at the time that the therapy's arrive.

686
00:44:19.400 --> 00:44:23.540
Those people will be rejuvenated such that they won't get back to being

687
00:44:23.541 --> 00:44:28.370
biologically 60 until they're 90 because that's the 30 years I'm talking about.

688
00:44:28.730 --> 00:44:32.100
But we've bought that time.
In that 30 years,

689
00:44:32.101 --> 00:44:34.230
we've been able to improve the quality,

690
00:44:34.231 --> 00:44:36.480
the comprehensiveness that convenience the costs,

691
00:44:36.481 --> 00:44:41.481
but especially the comprehensiveness of the therapies so that the same people

692
00:44:42.200 --> 00:44:47.200
are now 90 can be rejuvenated even though the damage that the bodies contain

693
00:44:48.720 --> 00:44:52.500
will be the difficult damage that the original therapies don't work on.

694
00:44:52.770 --> 00:44:53.670
Nevertheless,

695
00:44:53.790 --> 00:44:58.710
some of it will be amenable to repair by the new therapy by let's call it sends

696
00:44:58.711 --> 00:45:01.140
2.0 30 years down the road.

697
00:45:01.590 --> 00:45:06.590
So all we've got to do is improve the comprehensiveness of these therapies by a

698
00:45:06.781 --> 00:45:11.781
sufficient rate at an efficient rate to stay one step ahead of the problem and

699
00:45:12.421 --> 00:45:17.421
the faintest analysis of what that rate actually would be will tell you that

700
00:45:17.641 --> 00:45:18.360
it's tiny.

701
00:45:18.360 --> 00:45:23.360
It's fastly lower than the rate that we always see in the incremental

702
00:45:24.751 --> 00:45:28.140
improvements of technologies once the initial breakthrough has been made.

703
00:45:28.710 --> 00:45:29.760
So longevity,

704
00:45:29.761 --> 00:45:34.761
escape velocity is the reason why I believe that the first person to live to a

705
00:45:35.800 --> 00:45:38.880
thousand there's probably less than 10 years younger van,

706
00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:43.170
the first person to live to 115 and why the first cohort,

707
00:45:43.200 --> 00:45:48.200
most of whom will live to a thousand if probably only 10 years younger than the

708
00:45:48.691 --> 00:45:53.640
first cohort,
most of whom will live to 110 you know?
So these are,

709
00:45:54.600 --> 00:45:59.430
these are obvious things,
but talk to biologists about this,

710
00:45:59.640 --> 00:46:02.280
especially gerontologists they,
well,

711
00:46:02.340 --> 00:46:05.430
almost all of them run away very,

712
00:46:05.580 --> 00:46:09.690
very fast because first of all,
it's not science.

713
00:46:09.780 --> 00:46:13.110
Of course he's not fucking science.
It's technology.
All right,
I knew that.

714
00:46:13.440 --> 00:46:15.990
But that's,
that is also,

715
00:46:16.020 --> 00:46:20.490
it's politically incendiary gerontologists where you know,

716
00:46:20.491 --> 00:46:24.990
reputations to maintain and tenure to obtain and grant applications to submit.

717
00:46:25.350 --> 00:46:30.350
They do not want to be associated with things that the public haven't been able

718
00:46:31.141 --> 00:46:33.600
to get their heads around unless they sit in the public,

719
00:46:33.601 --> 00:46:37.080
aren't very good at math and they're not very good at things like this.

720
00:46:37.380 --> 00:46:42.120
So that is,
it's a very hard political sell right now.

721
00:46:42.330 --> 00:46:47.330
But I believe that it's better to tell the truth about what we can expect from

722
00:46:50.080 --> 00:46:55.080
anti aging medicine of the foreseeable future than to try to sweep it under the

723
00:46:56.641 --> 00:47:01.260
carpet.
I believe that the right thing to do is to actually say,

724
00:47:01.261 --> 00:47:02.190
look,
yes,

725
00:47:02.191 --> 00:47:06.450
we are going to be able to keep people youthful indefinitely because we are

726
00:47:06.451 --> 00:47:10.020
going to improve these therapies first and ask and to say yes.

727
00:47:10.050 --> 00:47:12.570
That's a good thing and not to be cowardly about it.

728
00:47:13.410 --> 00:47:17.820
Now the other thing to point out is that this is coming quite soon.

729
00:47:18.810 --> 00:47:23.810
I believe that we have a 50 50 chance of guessing these technologies working

730
00:47:26.251 --> 00:47:27.990
within about 20 years,

731
00:47:28.620 --> 00:47:32.860
just long as there is enough funding for the really early stage research that's

732
00:47:32.861 --> 00:47:35.890
happening right now.
Now,
of course I know perfectly well,

733
00:47:35.891 --> 00:47:39.310
but this is pioneering technology and like any pioneering technology,

734
00:47:39.311 --> 00:47:42.340
they timeframes are ridiculous.
The speculative,

735
00:47:42.370 --> 00:47:45.820
there's certainly a 10% chance that we won't get there for a hundred years

736
00:47:45.821 --> 00:47:48.340
because we'll hit problems that we haven't thought about yet,

737
00:47:48.610 --> 00:47:51.700
but some of the whole lot,
you know what I mean?
50% chances,

738
00:47:51.730 --> 00:47:53.410
quite enough to be worth fighting for.

739
00:47:54.850 --> 00:47:59.140
Thinking about longevity escape velocity though is that even the,

740
00:47:59.170 --> 00:48:04.170
it is a concept that gerontologists hate and the concept that the public doesn't

741
00:48:07.391 --> 00:48:12.040
get and just kind of feels intuitively it can't be true.

742
00:48:12.550 --> 00:48:17.470
Nevertheless,
it's only a matter of time before people do get it.
You know,

743
00:48:17.860 --> 00:48:22.860
it's so simple that people are just going to get it and I believe that that's

744
00:48:23.831 --> 00:48:26.410
probably going to happen within the next few years.

745
00:48:26.950 --> 00:48:30.760
I believe that there's going to be a real sea change in real tipping point in

746
00:48:30.761 --> 00:48:32.680
public attitudes,
public opinion,

747
00:48:32.800 --> 00:48:37.060
public understanding of this whole field and it's going to happen soon.

748
00:48:37.870 --> 00:48:42.870
And that's rather important to take into account because what it means is that

749
00:48:43.480 --> 00:48:48.480
we have the responsibility of those of us who do have a bit of intelligence and

750
00:48:49.211 --> 00:48:50.560
you've got understand this already.

751
00:48:50.860 --> 00:48:55.860
We have the responsibility to act now in whatever way we can to minimize the the

752
00:48:57.521 --> 00:48:59.470
turbulence.
You know,
the,
the,

753
00:48:59.560 --> 00:49:02.110
the sheer magnitude of the shit that's going to hit the fan.

754
00:49:02.111 --> 00:49:04.240
When the world realizes all of this,

755
00:49:04.570 --> 00:49:09.570
we have to try to figure out how to maximize the humanitarian benefit from all

756
00:49:10.931 --> 00:49:15.580
of this to maximize the number of lives saved and thereby to get these

757
00:49:15.581 --> 00:49:18.630
technologies out there as quickly as possible.
You know,
and,

758
00:49:18.760 --> 00:49:23.620
and a lot of that revolves around anticipating these changes in public
attitudes.

759
00:49:24.580 --> 00:49:29.350
Um,
let me explain why I say that
at the moment.

760
00:49:29.880 --> 00:49:32.950
What do you talk to people about and you say,
how long do you want to live?

761
00:49:33.130 --> 00:49:37.300
Would you want to live to 150?
Most people will say no.

762
00:49:38.200 --> 00:49:40.900
If you ask them that question in an unadorned manner,

763
00:49:41.710 --> 00:49:43.150
even if you ask them the questions,

764
00:49:43.151 --> 00:49:46.780
do you want to live to 150 in a truly useful state of health?

765
00:49:46.781 --> 00:49:51.781
They will still mostly say no largely because they won't take the question

766
00:49:52.641 --> 00:49:53.530
seriously.

767
00:49:54.010 --> 00:49:58.360
They weren't really believe that you mean what you say by the question.

768
00:49:59.350 --> 00:50:01.660
That's how deep seated the,

769
00:50:01.680 --> 00:50:06.680
an entrenched the belief in the inevitability of aging really is.

770
00:50:08.080 --> 00:50:13.080
Which means that when people are forced to think about the consequences of truly

771
00:50:14.891 --> 00:50:18.880
eliminating aging,
there's very,
very bad at it.

772
00:50:19.450 --> 00:50:24.450
They will come up with this or that potential problem that might be created as a

773
00:50:25.930 --> 00:50:28.280
consequence of fixing the problem we have today.

774
00:50:28.281 --> 00:50:32.120
The problem of aging and then two things will happen.

775
00:50:32.510 --> 00:50:33.343
Number one,

776
00:50:33.560 --> 00:50:37.100
they will immediately presume that the problem with insoluble and he's got to be

777
00:50:37.101 --> 00:50:40.370
far worse than the problem of aging.
And number two,

778
00:50:40.580 --> 00:50:43.460
they will immediately switch their brains off and refused to consider the

779
00:50:43.461 --> 00:50:46.460
possibility that we might have a way to solve this other problem too.

780
00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:50.270
So for example,
almost every talk,

781
00:50:50.271 --> 00:50:53.660
I guess people will come up even in almost every interview,

782
00:50:53.661 --> 00:50:57.800
I guess people will come up and they'll say,
well,
we push all the people.

783
00:51:00.200 --> 00:51:01.130
And you know,

784
00:51:01.160 --> 00:51:06.160
I think giving perfectly simple answers to this question for God only knows how

785
00:51:06.681 --> 00:51:11.000
long and nobody challenges the answers.
You know,
the standard answer,

786
00:51:11.060 --> 00:51:15.320
the best answer is simply other technologies like renewable energy and

787
00:51:15.321 --> 00:51:19.460
artificial meat and desalination and so on are going to be increasing the

788
00:51:19.461 --> 00:51:24.461
carrying capacity of the planet far more rapidly than the population of the

789
00:51:24.921 --> 00:51:27.370
planet will increase.
Therefore,
the,

790
00:51:27.730 --> 00:51:32.720
the population stress that the planet is currently experiencing will diminish

791
00:51:32.960 --> 00:51:37.220
whether we cure aging or not.
That's the obvious answer,

792
00:51:37.730 --> 00:51:40.670
really obvious.
And no one ever says,
oh,
that doesn't,
that's true.

793
00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:44.450
They just let it go in one ear and out the other and the following day they'll

794
00:51:44.451 --> 00:51:46.070
come back and they'll still ask the same question.

795
00:51:46.310 --> 00:51:49.760
It's extremely frustrating and you can probably talk.
Um,
and,

796
00:51:49.761 --> 00:51:51.970
and it's the same with all the other nonsense.
I mean,
well,

797
00:51:52.030 --> 00:51:55.940
what great example is that people will get this out of the population,
um,

798
00:51:56.060 --> 00:52:00.920
concern and the same people in the next breath will say,
oh,

799
00:52:00.930 --> 00:52:02.870
do are going to be for the rich.
I mean,

800
00:52:02.871 --> 00:52:07.250
how the fuck can you not say that these things are mutually exclusive?
I mean,

801
00:52:07.251 --> 00:52:11.090
really?
So,
I mean,
you know,
it's very,
it's very frustrating as you can tell.
Um,

802
00:52:11.210 --> 00:52:12.090
and you know what?
I mean,

803
00:52:12.140 --> 00:52:15.620
last I heard dictator was fairly high on the league table of risky jobs.

804
00:52:15.621 --> 00:52:20.210
You know,
that most people don't really die of aging when they anyway.

805
00:52:21.910 --> 00:52:23.440
And you know,
I mean boredom.

806
00:52:23.450 --> 00:52:25.940
You know what my friend Brian Kennedy's had a good one on that.
He said,

807
00:52:25.941 --> 00:52:26.271
well look,

808
00:52:26.271 --> 00:52:29.030
if I've got the choice of getting Alzheimer's when I'm 80 or being bored when

809
00:52:29.031 --> 00:52:33.010
I'm 150,
I think I know which one I'm going to choose.
Um,
and uh,
you know,

810
00:52:33.050 --> 00:52:37.100
there's a sense of proportion just does not come into the way that people

811
00:52:37.101 --> 00:52:40.310
address these questions.
It's absolutely embarrassing.

812
00:52:40.630 --> 00:52:43.580
So obviously I don't have much time for this nonsense.
I am.

813
00:52:43.910 --> 00:52:48.910
I feel that it's important to go out there and be positive and say to people,

814
00:52:49.551 --> 00:52:52.490
listen,
for Christ's sake,
do you want to get Alzheimer's?

815
00:52:52.700 --> 00:52:56.510
Do you want anyone else to get Alzheimer's?
It's cancer.
I said,
no you don't.

816
00:52:56.690 --> 00:53:01.310
So it's consider a world in which nobody does get those things.

817
00:53:01.550 --> 00:53:03.290
That would be quite nice,
wouldn't it?

818
00:53:03.650 --> 00:53:06.950
And you'd have a situation where the elderly were still able bodied and they

819
00:53:06.951 --> 00:53:08.960
were able to contribute well to society.

820
00:53:08.961 --> 00:53:13.160
So everybody will be ridiculously more prosperous and they will have the energy

821
00:53:13.161 --> 00:53:14.180
to explore novelty.

822
00:53:14.181 --> 00:53:17.780
So they would not get bored any more than a young person gets bored when they're

823
00:53:17.781 --> 00:53:21.530
bored.
You there go and find something new to do,
you know,
Jesus.

824
00:53:22.460 --> 00:53:26.400
So that's enough of the ranch.
I'll come back to another ranch shortly,

825
00:53:26.401 --> 00:53:31.320
but before I do that,
let me just actually talk a bit about the,
um,

826
00:53:31.740 --> 00:53:36.270
about the spinoffs that we're doing because we started out as a nonprofit,
um,

827
00:53:36.300 --> 00:53:37.440
many years ago now.

828
00:53:37.590 --> 00:53:41.550
And the reason we did was because the word that we were doing was so early stage

829
00:53:41.580 --> 00:53:44.400
that there was no way it was investible even in,

830
00:53:44.680 --> 00:53:48.240
even in Silicon Valley where obviously we've got a nicely high density of

831
00:53:48.241 --> 00:53:52.590
visionary investors.
Um,
but that's changed over the past few years.

832
00:53:52.591 --> 00:53:56.130
We've been able to push some things far enough along in terms of proof of

833
00:53:56.131 --> 00:53:57.990
concept that we have been able to spend them out.

834
00:53:58.800 --> 00:54:01.230
Don't just give you a few examples.
This is a company,

835
00:54:01.231 --> 00:54:04.710
it's right so far about five or five and a half million dollars.
Um,

836
00:54:04.740 --> 00:54:07.140
it's looking mainly at macular degeneration.

837
00:54:07.141 --> 00:54:10.740
The number one cause of blindness in the elderly actually pursuing very much the

838
00:54:10.741 --> 00:54:14.790
same approach to it that I already outlined in relation to atherosclerosis.

839
00:54:14.791 --> 00:54:17.550
Though in this case the target is not oxidized cholesterol.

840
00:54:17.551 --> 00:54:20.310
It's something completely different.
Um,
so that's pretty good news.

841
00:54:20.490 --> 00:54:24.270
Another example is a company came out of Texas,

842
00:54:25.050 --> 00:54:27.390
so we funded all surface ever.
Really is,

843
00:54:27.660 --> 00:54:30.240
and this is to do with what's called amyloidosis,

844
00:54:30.270 --> 00:54:34.320
which turns out to be a very important reason why the extreme elderly people

845
00:54:34.321 --> 00:54:37.970
over the age of 100 and 510 dark.
This is what they,

846
00:54:37.990 --> 00:54:41.790
this is what most of them die off.
Um,
we've got a company called Aira Ghost,

847
00:54:41.820 --> 00:54:44.700
which was started by the person who used to be our chief operating officer.

848
00:54:45.060 --> 00:54:50.060
It's working on Oregon cryo preservation and have on a new method for freezing

849
00:54:50.461 --> 00:54:55.230
organs in such a way as to basically do no damage to them by crystallization or

850
00:54:55.231 --> 00:54:58.110
anything like that so that you can warm them up again and stick them into

851
00:54:58.111 --> 00:54:58.944
another person.

852
00:54:59.070 --> 00:55:03.930
And this is something that has been quite a holy grail of organ transplantation

853
00:55:03.931 --> 00:55:08.580
for a long time,
but this group have now figured out how to do it.

854
00:55:08.790 --> 00:55:13.050
And again,
this is,
you know,
they've been,
they've received only seed money so far,

855
00:55:13.051 --> 00:55:15.120
but they are moving forward very rapidly.

856
00:55:15.120 --> 00:55:18.060
Now another example is a company called ocean,

857
00:55:18.061 --> 00:55:21.180
which is looking at senescent cells,
so less themselves,

858
00:55:21.210 --> 00:55:25.560
the type of cell that gets into an aberrant state and does more harm than good,

859
00:55:25.561 --> 00:55:29.010
but it doesn't go away.
And this is a way of getting rid of them.

860
00:55:29.011 --> 00:55:32.670
It's a bit more controllable than the drugs you may have heard about that and

861
00:55:32.830 --> 00:55:36.710
that other companies are looking for.
Now,
um,

862
00:55:36.980 --> 00:55:39.810
I know that you know,
this actually is,
we're just around the corner.

863
00:55:39.811 --> 00:55:43.890
We are headquartered three miles,
two miles from here.
I cycled here today.

864
00:55:44.310 --> 00:55:46.860
So the fact is you guys,

865
00:55:46.861 --> 00:55:50.760
yourselves could make a difference and any of you want to come and visit,

866
00:55:50.761 --> 00:55:52.680
you're always very welcome.
You can,

867
00:55:52.800 --> 00:55:55.080
I'll give you my email address at the end of the talk.

868
00:55:55.350 --> 00:55:59.370
You can get in touch through the people here who are already in contact with us

869
00:55:59.371 --> 00:56:00.330
and already donating.

870
00:56:01.230 --> 00:56:03.540
I mentioned the effect of altruism at the beginning of the talk.

871
00:56:03.541 --> 00:56:07.260
I'm going to mention it again.
That number I've got on this slide.

872
00:56:07.261 --> 00:56:12.050
$1 per life is a fairly conservative estimate.
You can do these numbers.

873
00:56:12.070 --> 00:56:13.060
You can just say,
well,
okay,

874
00:56:13.080 --> 00:56:17.730
look how much is the current shorter given money,

875
00:56:17.790 --> 00:56:20.820
slowing things down,
and of course that's subjective,

876
00:56:20.821 --> 00:56:24.490
but my current estimate is that probably about 10 years,

877
00:56:24.940 --> 00:56:29.560
but we could speed up the defeat of aging,
the achievement of longevity,

878
00:56:29.561 --> 00:56:34.561
escape velocity by about a decade just by getting this work done at a speed that

879
00:56:35.801 --> 00:56:38.440
is not limited by financial resources.

880
00:56:38.860 --> 00:56:41.710
So how much financial resources to do that,

881
00:56:42.070 --> 00:56:46.120
we just need one more did it on a budget.

882
00:56:46.330 --> 00:56:49.630
That still means we'd be looking at 1% of CALICO's budget.

883
00:56:50.140 --> 00:56:54.760
We need about 40 million a year,
40 million.
I mean,

884
00:56:54.970 --> 00:56:57.550
that's a tiny amount and we could go,

885
00:56:57.551 --> 00:57:01.540
I'm going to say three times faster in the initial few years anyway,
and I think,

886
00:57:01.541 --> 00:57:05.740
yeah,
we could talk a decade off the time involved.

887
00:57:05.980 --> 00:57:08.500
So we're talking about half a billion lives.

888
00:57:08.501 --> 00:57:11.080
That's about about how many people die of aging in the decade.

889
00:57:11.580 --> 00:57:15.940
And we're talking roughly 40 or $50 million a year for 10 years.

890
00:57:16.270 --> 00:57:18.910
So it comes out around a dollar per life.

891
00:57:19.360 --> 00:57:23.070
And if you do that same calculation for anything else,
you know,
mosquito nets,

892
00:57:23.080 --> 00:57:25.600
whatever you like,
you don't get that number,

893
00:57:25.750 --> 00:57:28.960
you get a number that's much larger in terms of number of dollars per life.

894
00:57:29.200 --> 00:57:32.230
And that's of course,
just presuming that the life is the same,

895
00:57:32.231 --> 00:57:34.590
which of course it isn't because we're,

896
00:57:34.700 --> 00:57:38.080
what we should really be calculating is the number of additional healthy life

897
00:57:38.081 --> 00:57:41.200
years,
which is essentially indefinite.

898
00:57:41.470 --> 00:57:43.630
In the case of defeating aging,

899
00:57:43.631 --> 00:57:46.090
where it's definitely not indefinite for anything else.

900
00:57:47.350 --> 00:57:48.760
Keep wanting is the last line,

901
00:57:49.180 --> 00:57:53.440
the number of dollars per life it's going to go up as time goes on.

902
00:57:54.160 --> 00:57:59.160
The earliest stages of this work are always the time when you can make the most

903
00:57:59.351 --> 00:58:02.110
difference with a given amount of financial backing.

904
00:58:02.620 --> 00:58:05.230
So now is the time when you can make the most difference.

905
00:58:05.710 --> 00:58:09.550
This isn't the book I wrote,
which there is one leftover over on the,

906
00:58:09.551 --> 00:58:11.620
over on the table over there.
Um,

907
00:58:11.800 --> 00:58:14.020
but obviously we're perfectly happy to provide more of them.

908
00:58:14.021 --> 00:58:18.520
I wrote this about 10 years ago and that might suggest to you that it's out of

909
00:58:18.521 --> 00:58:19.690
date.
Uh,

910
00:58:19.691 --> 00:58:23.860
but luckily even though the has been huge amount of progress over the past

911
00:58:23.860 --> 00:58:24.220
several years,

912
00:58:24.220 --> 00:58:28.480
the progress is in question has been very mark what we expected it to be,

913
00:58:28.481 --> 00:58:31.660
what we've predicted it would be.
As I mentioned at the beginning,
no,

914
00:58:31.810 --> 00:58:35.260
we haven't had any nasty surprises.
So in that sense,

915
00:58:35.261 --> 00:58:39.460
the science is still very much what it should be and I very much recommend it.

916
00:58:39.461 --> 00:58:42.940
It's written for non specialists.
In other words,
it doesn't have any real,

917
00:58:43.060 --> 00:58:45.160
you know,
rely on phone,
biological jargon.

918
00:58:45.370 --> 00:58:49.360
But at the same time it is pretty dense.
You won't get through it in one sitting.

919
00:58:49.860 --> 00:58:51.790
I'll stop there.
Thank you.
I'm happy to answer questions.

920
00:59:01.590 --> 00:59:04.830
I don't know whether people can just shout or whether the microphone for the

921
00:59:04.831 --> 00:59:05.664
recording or what.

922
00:59:07.780 --> 00:59:09.860
<v 3>Hi,
my name is Evan.
Thank you.
Great Talk.
Uh,</v>

923
00:59:10.180 --> 00:59:12.550
just a quick question on the fundraising piece.
Like am I,

924
00:59:12.570 --> 00:59:15.460
my sense is that there is a lot of money out of there for if you had Brandon for

925
00:59:15.461 --> 00:59:19.410
like cancer research or Alzheimer Research,
you know,
they're,
they're,
they're,

926
00:59:19.430 --> 00:59:22.670
you know,
there might be other,
I was how well,
how has,
you know,

927
00:59:22.820 --> 00:59:25.790
what are your thoughts on just maybe rebranding and going after different

928
00:59:25.791 --> 00:59:26.590
avenues there?

929
00:59:26.590 --> 00:59:30.880
<v 4>So the,
um,
the,
the issue that really is we have to do two things.</v>

930
00:59:30.881 --> 00:59:32.020
On the one hand,
yes,

931
00:59:32.021 --> 00:59:36.520
we absolutely have to get people to understand that this is a medical problem

932
00:59:36.521 --> 00:59:39.670
and this is not something in the stratosphere as I mentioned at the beginning.

933
00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:40.751
But on the other hand,

934
00:59:40.751 --> 00:59:44.950
we also have to demonstrate that the approach that we want to take,

935
00:59:45.220 --> 00:59:48.910
which is substantially different from what other people are taking is much more

936
00:59:48.911 --> 00:59:53.650
likely to succeed.
If we talk,
for example,
about Alzheimer's,

937
00:59:53.860 --> 00:59:57.550
then we started out in a position where we are competing with the established

938
00:59:57.551 --> 01:00:02.020
anti Alzheimer's community and people are going to say,
well look,

939
01:00:02.021 --> 01:00:05.740
if this is worth doing and surely the Alzheimer's Association is going to be

940
01:00:05.741 --> 01:00:09.730
funding it already and therefore since the Antarctic must not be worth doing.

941
01:00:10.030 --> 01:00:11.320
So it's got,
it's circular.

942
01:00:11.530 --> 01:00:15.430
But what it means is that we have to start off by telling it like it is in terms

943
01:00:15.431 --> 01:00:18.100
of the taxonomy of sickness and say,
listen,

944
01:00:18.101 --> 01:00:23.101
think about aging in a new way and then break that down into what is common

945
01:00:23.621 --> 01:00:28.610
sense,
what makes sense to do about it?
Well,
the question over here.
Yes.

946
01:00:29.040 --> 01:00:34.040
<v 3>So how about New Korea genomic mutations in stealth,</v>

947
01:00:34.840 --> 01:00:39.780
Andrea mutations.
I mean,
that goes as a snowbird,
right?
But in the end,

948
01:00:39.781 --> 01:00:41.340
that's hard drives cancer,
right?

949
01:00:42.440 --> 01:00:43.850
<v 4>Uh,
you want to about the effect of,
okay,</v>

950
01:00:43.870 --> 01:00:47.220
what's the Mitochondria of the attractions are one of our seven strand.

951
01:00:47.730 --> 01:00:52.730
And even though unlike the other ground where I've gotten a lot of mutations

952
01:00:55.201 --> 01:01:00.201
cannot definitively be linked to any particular pathology of old age in the same

953
01:01:00.751 --> 01:01:04.680
way that for example,
molecular wave products can be linked to atherosclerosis.

954
01:01:05.240 --> 01:01:06.240
Uh,
nevertheless,

955
01:01:06.290 --> 01:01:09.120
there's plenty of circumstantial evidence that said we need to fix them.

956
01:01:09.630 --> 01:01:14.350
And so what we're doing is putting backup copies of the mitochondrial DNA,

957
01:01:14.470 --> 01:01:16.860
the nucleus modify.
Why did it works?

958
01:01:17.250 --> 01:01:20.190
This is an idea that were first put forward in the 1980s.

959
01:01:20.760 --> 01:01:23.070
People basically gave up on it and inside it was too hard.

960
01:01:23.071 --> 01:01:25.600
We decided they'd given up too easily.
We were right.

961
01:01:26.190 --> 01:01:29.910
It took us 10 years to prove it.
But we had a paper out a year ago,

962
01:01:29.911 --> 01:01:33.060
which were the great breakthrough compared to anything that had been achieved so

963
01:01:33.061 --> 01:01:37.500
far.
And we are,
we're chugging along.

964
01:01:37.501 --> 01:01:38.370
We're going to get there now.

965
01:01:38.820 --> 01:01:42.990
So that's good if nucleotide and different matter entirely.

966
01:01:43.010 --> 01:01:45.030
So in one sense,

967
01:01:45.031 --> 01:01:48.570
of course we're very much tackling those in the sense that one of our other

968
01:01:48.571 --> 01:01:52.560
strands,
it's cancer.
We don't want cells that divide when they shouldn't.

969
01:01:52.860 --> 01:01:56.400
And we have a particular approach to going about cancer and maybe other brokers

970
01:01:56.401 --> 01:02:00.660
will work.
The question then is,
if we don't have to worry about cancer,

971
01:02:00.661 --> 01:02:04.980
if we've got a fix for cancer,
then do nuclear mutations still matter?

972
01:02:05.670 --> 01:02:09.980
And it looks very much as though they'd done the,

973
01:02:10.520 --> 01:02:13.050
the ads that we're looking at it is to say,
well look,

974
01:02:13.770 --> 01:02:18.600
one cell can kill you if it gets the wrong constellation of mutations.

975
01:02:18.630 --> 01:02:23.430
It's death by dividing and dividing and becoming a cancer.
Whereas anything else,

976
01:02:23.431 --> 01:02:25.830
anything that does not have to do with the cell cycle,

977
01:02:26.580 --> 01:02:28.330
you've got to have that mutation happen.
You know,

978
01:02:28.331 --> 01:02:32.550
a lot of different cells in the same tissue in order for it to have any

979
01:02:32.551 --> 01:02:35.580
phenotypic consequences and the actual bad effects.

980
01:02:36.090 --> 01:02:37.560
And that isn't going to happen.

981
01:02:37.970 --> 01:02:42.860
And it's the same machinery that defends the fan DNA repair and maintenance

982
01:02:42.870 --> 01:02:45.780
machinery that defends against both outcome.

983
01:02:46.380 --> 01:02:50.400
So essentially what I,
I've called this protagonistic lower trophy.

984
01:02:50.440 --> 01:02:53.190
I could explain the reason for that terminology if you like.

985
01:02:53.191 --> 01:02:58.191
But the point is that the imperative not to die of cancer before we've

986
01:02:59.071 --> 01:03:00.990
reproduced,
um,

987
01:03:01.590 --> 01:03:05.330
has forced evolution to develop DNA repair and maintenance machinery.

988
01:03:05.400 --> 01:03:09.060
That's so good that it's unnecessarily good for every other purpose.

989
01:03:09.900 --> 01:03:14.900
And so we just don't get any consequences of mutations of other kinds until much

990
01:03:15.061 --> 01:03:16.680
more than a currently normal lifespan.

991
01:03:17.430 --> 01:03:21.300
Now that may sound a little abstract and theoretical and maybe it's not

992
01:03:21.301 --> 01:03:22.230
completely worded side.

993
01:03:22.231 --> 01:03:25.350
So obviously we would like to have data that actually confirms this,

994
01:03:25.830 --> 01:03:27.960
but that seems,
it seems to me exactly what we have.

995
01:03:28.800 --> 01:03:32.490
People who've done the experiments looking at the rate at which mutations

996
01:03:32.491 --> 01:03:35.850
accumulate in,
um,
in mammals.

997
01:03:36.270 --> 01:03:41.160
And it's looking okay during growth during,
until up to adulthood.

998
01:03:41.490 --> 01:03:44.940
The reason the cumulation of mutation load in every tissue,

999
01:03:45.240 --> 01:03:47.040
a respectable for special,
right?

1000
01:03:47.330 --> 01:03:51.840
But once an animal mouse reaches adulthood,
in most issues,

1001
01:03:51.870 --> 01:03:55.410
there's nothing any further increases undetectable.

1002
01:03:55.650 --> 01:03:58.080
And of course it was no increase in the company and the consequence of an

1003
01:03:58.081 --> 01:04:01.710
increased.
So,
so that's pretty good.
Now again,
it's not worth sides.

1004
01:04:01.790 --> 01:04:05.010
It could be other types of mutation or epic mutations can just to the

1005
01:04:05.011 --> 01:04:08.520
decorations of DNA.
And we've actually spent a bit of money on that,

1006
01:04:08.700 --> 01:04:09.533
on that question,

1007
01:04:09.690 --> 01:04:12.480
trying to actually get a definitive answer to whether that matters.

1008
01:04:12.850 --> 01:04:14.490
Haven't really got a definitive answer yet,

1009
01:04:14.491 --> 01:04:17.400
but insofar as we have an answer at all,
it looks to be coming out the same way.

1010
01:04:19.960 --> 01:04:23.710
<v 5>I have a question,
kind of a bigger picture question.</v>

1011
01:04:23.711 --> 01:04:28.030
So when you're talking about pathology and not looking at pathologies,

1012
01:04:28.980 --> 01:04:30.820
um,
so I'm thinking like cancer for example.

1013
01:04:30.821 --> 01:04:35.821
What's the difference between not curing cancer but somehow rejuvenating,

1014
01:04:37.100 --> 01:04:40.270
um,
cells that are splitting and so like the big vision,

1015
01:04:40.271 --> 01:04:45.271
is that like a top up rejuvinating preventative injection once every year or

1016
01:04:47.171 --> 01:04:50.680
something to keep people or is it actually treating pathologies once they occur?

1017
01:04:51.470 --> 01:04:52.700
<v 4>Well,
a bit of both really.</v>

1018
01:04:52.730 --> 01:04:57.730
So the idea is certainly to identify damage before it if symptomatic before it

1019
01:04:58.131 --> 01:05:01.340
reaches the point of being bad for you.
So in the case of cancer,

1020
01:05:01.580 --> 01:05:05.960
that basically means identifying cells that have got most of the mutations that

1021
01:05:05.961 --> 01:05:07.820
they,
that you don't want them to have.

1022
01:05:08.030 --> 01:05:10.550
And then dividing when they shouldn't and let just get the immune system and

1023
01:05:10.551 --> 01:05:13.820
fell on.
So identifying sort of aberrant in one way or another,

1024
01:05:14.390 --> 01:05:18.850
not actually our approach to fixing cancer involves essentially putting a time

1025
01:05:18.851 --> 01:05:22.890
bomb in that that stops the cancer from dividing,
um,

1026
01:05:22.930 --> 01:05:27.100
indefinitely essentially causes the ends of the chromosomes to get shorter so

1027
01:05:27.101 --> 01:05:31.540
that eventually the fell basically divides itself into oblivion by virtue of

1028
01:05:31.541 --> 01:05:35.920
having an [inaudible] essentially joined together.
Um,

1029
01:05:36.550 --> 01:05:37.900
but there are other possibilities,

1030
01:05:37.901 --> 01:05:41.470
especially enhancing the immune system is a big fashionable area right now.

1031
01:05:41.470 --> 01:05:44.880
That may very well be a good answer as well.
So,
um,
so,

1032
01:05:44.890 --> 01:05:48.520
so the fairest way to go about it,
but yes,
the idea is to go after the damage,

1033
01:05:48.550 --> 01:05:53.170
the accumulating damage,
not necessarily the pathology itself.
However,

1034
01:05:53.470 --> 01:05:56.170
and this is not just for cancer,
but elsewhere as well.

1035
01:05:56.440 --> 01:06:00.310
It may also end up being a good thing to go after them both together I think go

1036
01:06:00.311 --> 01:06:02.020
after the damage and the pathology.

1037
01:06:02.380 --> 01:06:06.040
I mentioned earlier that the fundamental reason why the geriatrics approach

1038
01:06:06.041 --> 01:06:08.730
doesn't work is because the cause of the pathologies,

1039
01:06:08.740 --> 01:06:12.120
the damage is continuing to accumulate.
So what that means is this,

1040
01:06:12.140 --> 01:06:15.790
you can repair the damage and stuff it from continuing to accumulate.

1041
01:06:16.210 --> 01:06:20.500
Then maybe some of the pathologies will just automatically resolve in their own

1042
01:06:20.501 --> 01:06:23.210
rights on their own,
but maybe not.

1043
01:06:23.500 --> 01:06:27.430
But still it means that the straightforward geriatric therapies that go off to

1044
01:06:27.431 --> 01:06:30.740
the pathology is we'll have a much better chance against those pathologies and

1045
01:06:30.760 --> 01:06:33.720
they would normally have.
Yup.

1046
01:06:37.540 --> 01:06:38.373
Yup.
Got It.

1047
01:06:39.490 --> 01:06:44.450
<v 6>Hey,
there's quite a good chance that we'll get this,
um,
uh,</v>

1048
01:06:44.940 --> 01:06:48.010
like technologist working near future.
Uh,

1049
01:06:48.310 --> 01:06:51.150
like would you recommend any or like,
um,

1050
01:06:51.480 --> 01:06:55.650
existing methods to kind of buy us like more years to kind of,

1051
01:06:55.800 --> 01:06:58.230
to actually reach this point?

1052
01:06:59.080 --> 01:07:01.190
<v 4>People think I'm joking when I give their farm for,</v>

1053
01:07:01.210 --> 01:07:05.080
but the fact is the only thing you can do if,
give me large amount of money,

1054
01:07:06.730 --> 01:07:09.430
the fact is there's nothing yet that works.
I mean,

1055
01:07:09.431 --> 01:07:11.710
of course there are obvious things like don't smoke,

1056
01:07:11.711 --> 01:07:14.620
don't get theory or flee overweight,
but nothing,
there's nothing new.

1057
01:07:15.040 --> 01:07:18.730
No one's come up with anything that gave her more than more than a very

1058
01:07:18.731 --> 01:07:23.731
negligible amount at Beth of both burn with the bell health with what we can do

1059
01:07:24.371 --> 01:07:25.204
today.

1060
01:07:25.330 --> 01:07:30.330
So we are absolutely reliant on still being around in time for the technology

1061
01:07:30.481 --> 01:07:31.630
and for that don't yet exist.

1062
01:07:34.140 --> 01:07:37.200
<v 6>So I wanted to kind of ask kind of a speculative question.</v>

1063
01:07:37.980 --> 01:07:41.640
Imagine still thought experiment that these technologies do come to fruition.

1064
01:07:41.641 --> 01:07:46.380
We've massively improved human lifespan,
even reaching longevity,
escape velocity.

1065
01:07:46.620 --> 01:07:49.770
How do you see that affecting the evolution of the human species to some of

1066
01:07:49.771 --> 01:07:53.280
these methods where introducing themselves with modified genes that become a

1067
01:07:53.281 --> 01:07:55.140
mechanism of pollution?
What,
what happened?

1068
01:07:55.450 --> 01:07:59.660
<v 4>Yeah,
that's the answer.
So basically people say,
well,
oh well we have a,
well,</v>

1069
01:07:59.670 --> 01:08:01.000
a bit won't have so many kids.

1070
01:08:01.060 --> 01:08:03.190
Therefore evolution will flow down complete nonsense.

1071
01:08:03.220 --> 01:08:06.790
Actually what's going to happen is the opposite of evolution will vary greatly

1072
01:08:06.791 --> 01:08:07.420
speed up,

1073
01:08:07.420 --> 01:08:11.290
because a lot of the technologies that we're going to be developing that will

1074
01:08:11.291 --> 01:08:16.291
allow us to implement these rejuvenation therapies will be ones that involve

1075
01:08:16.431 --> 01:08:19.880
manipulating the genomes of people who are already alive.

1076
01:08:20.210 --> 01:08:24.380
So we'll be able to translate the genetic composition of paper without any of

1077
01:08:24.381 --> 01:08:27.350
this terribly time consuming,
consuming reproduction nonsense.

1078
01:08:28.370 --> 01:08:31.580
<v 5>I think we'll be able to keep like all people evolving at the same rate.</v>

1079
01:08:31.900 --> 01:08:34.570
<v 4>Wow.
Of course.
It depends what you mean by right.</v>

1080
01:08:34.600 --> 01:08:37.470
Because people will be going in different directions,
you know,

1081
01:08:37.480 --> 01:08:39.280
different people will have different modification.

1082
01:08:39.720 --> 01:08:43.310
<v 5>Thinking especially about the things that really affect success of like</v>

1083
01:08:43.311 --> 01:08:45.230
intelligence is probably the most important.

1084
01:08:45.930 --> 01:08:47.590
<v 4>Again,
you don't know.
I mean,
okay.</v>

1085
01:08:47.591 --> 01:08:51.010
So of course there we've got the issue that we haven't the faintest idea what

1086
01:08:51.011 --> 01:08:55.170
James actually really confer intelligence in the first place.
Um,

1087
01:08:55.690 --> 01:08:58.390
so you know,
that's a,
that's a whole different questions.
And to be honest,

1088
01:08:58.391 --> 01:09:00.610
I haven't put much thought into that and I don't think it's my job.

1089
01:09:02.990 --> 01:09:07.990
<v 5>Can you tell me just briefly about what's been done for a telemetric</v>

1090
01:09:10.100 --> 01:09:10.933
degeneration?

1091
01:09:11.450 --> 01:09:11.721
<v 4>Right.</v>

1092
01:09:11.721 --> 01:09:15.110
So this goes back to the question though of about cam through a moment ago.

1093
01:09:15.950 --> 01:09:18.560
So wellness.
So for those of you who don't know,

1094
01:09:18.561 --> 01:09:20.990
when cells divide the end of the chromosomes,

1095
01:09:20.991 --> 01:09:24.020
which are called the telomeres get shorter.
This is an intrinsic,

1096
01:09:24.080 --> 01:09:29.080
absolutely irrevocable property of the way that DNA has replicated.

1097
01:09:29.580 --> 01:09:33.170
And in order to compensate for that,
we have an enzyme called telomerase,

1098
01:09:33.200 --> 01:09:37.340
which sticks now noncoding random,
well not random but specifically,

1099
01:09:37.341 --> 01:09:42.100
but very simple sequences of DNA on the end of the chromosomes to um,

1100
01:09:42.290 --> 01:09:44.690
to counteract the shortening that would be occur.

1101
01:09:45.680 --> 01:09:50.680
And some people think that is important for us to enhance the activity of this

1102
01:09:51.861 --> 01:09:55.640
enzyme telomerase.
And in order to combat aging,

1103
01:09:55.940 --> 01:10:00.400
because cells in older people have obviously divided more often and therefore

1104
01:10:00.410 --> 01:10:01.580
they will have shorter telomeres.

1105
01:10:02.390 --> 01:10:07.390
The counter to that argument is that actually most of our cells don't divide

1106
01:10:07.701 --> 01:10:12.701
very often at all and they not often leaving enough in a normal lifetime to get

1107
01:10:12.981 --> 01:10:17.060
to the point where their telomeres problematically short.
And furthermore,

1108
01:10:17.061 --> 01:10:21.440
that the cells that do divide rather often already do express enough of this

1109
01:10:21.441 --> 01:10:26.180
enzyme telomerase to compensate and make sure that the two of them only get

1110
01:10:26.480 --> 01:10:30.250
shorter at what seems to be a manager of all right.
However,

1111
01:10:30.251 --> 01:10:31.820
there's still controversy about this.

1112
01:10:31.821 --> 01:10:35.060
There are certain reasons to believe that in some aspect of the body,

1113
01:10:35.061 --> 01:10:36.440
especially the immune system,

1114
01:10:36.920 --> 01:10:40.420
this phenomenon which is called replicative Senescence,
we've still them,

1115
01:10:40.421 --> 01:10:43.550
I was getting too short,
could be a,
it could be a real thing,
a real,

1116
01:10:43.551 --> 01:10:45.810
a real contributor to ill health.

1117
01:10:46.540 --> 01:10:51.540
So we want to do stimulation of telomerase and indeed the Ronna message drugs

1118
01:10:53.001 --> 01:10:56.930
especially that seem to have that effect and those guys are improving all the

1119
01:10:56.931 --> 01:11:00.120
time.
So That's interesting.
But we always have to be,

1120
01:11:00.390 --> 01:11:05.390
be aware that cancer cells divide when we don't want them to and they do it

1121
01:11:06.050 --> 01:11:09.620
precisely by elevating their level of synthesis,

1122
01:11:09.621 --> 01:11:11.780
that level of expression of telomerase.

1123
01:11:12.110 --> 01:11:16.920
So they are the NFL w who fill on maybe the question we would like to suppress

1124
01:11:17.400 --> 01:11:18.233
now.
Um,

1125
01:11:19.240 --> 01:11:24.240
if we come up with a method for eliminating cancer that doesn't involve telomere

1126
01:11:26.881 --> 01:11:31.080
shortening,
let's say just to do with the immune system and it works really,

1127
01:11:31.081 --> 01:11:34.380
really,
really well,
then we're Humphrey.
Absolutely.

1128
01:11:34.381 --> 01:11:38.340
It will make sense to look pretty hard as well as to stimulate telomerase and

1129
01:11:38.341 --> 01:11:42.600
thereby perhaps rejuvenate the immune system and maybe other cell types that

1130
01:11:42.870 --> 01:11:47.010
might be experiencing some level of replicative senescence.
Uh,

1131
01:11:47.040 --> 01:11:49.170
however it could be that we will end up wanting to go.

1132
01:11:49.171 --> 01:11:54.171
The other way that we will find that the suppression of telomerase activity,

1133
01:11:54.961 --> 01:11:56.850
it's the only really solid,

1134
01:11:56.851 --> 01:12:01.851
really ironclad way to eliminate cancer and that was just all live with the side

1135
01:12:02.251 --> 01:12:06.870
effects of which will actually be worse than what we might see is a day in
which,

1136
01:12:06.871 --> 01:12:07.830
for example,

1137
01:12:07.860 --> 01:12:12.030
the stem cells of the blood can no longer divided indefinitely until we ended up

1138
01:12:12.031 --> 01:12:13.050
with anemia and so on.

1139
01:12:13.680 --> 01:12:17.160
The reason why I say we could live with that is because the way in which we

1140
01:12:17.161 --> 01:12:21.500
could fix those side effect is actually conceptually fairly straight forward.

1141
01:12:21.510 --> 01:12:22.770
Namely stem cell therapy.

1142
01:12:23.070 --> 01:12:28.070
There's only a very small number of stem cell pools that are actually dividing

1143
01:12:28.741 --> 01:12:33.210
often enough for this to be a problem.
The blood is one of course,
the Epidermis,

1144
01:12:33.211 --> 01:12:35.070
the outer layer of the skin,
the inner,

1145
01:12:35.071 --> 01:12:37.950
the inner linings of guts and probably the lung.

1146
01:12:37.980 --> 01:12:41.700
Those are really the only ones that massive.
And so we'd been looking quite hard.

1147
01:12:41.720 --> 01:12:46.720
The idea of doing stem cell therapies on all of those with cells that are unable

1148
01:12:47.731 --> 01:12:52.170
to make telomerase and therefore are protected against becoming properly

1149
01:12:52.171 --> 01:12:56.010
cancerous.
That's the kind of where we think about
next.

1150
01:12:57.390 --> 01:12:58.223
They've got the mic.

1151
01:13:02.690 --> 01:13:07.340
<v 3>Sorry.
Okay.
Sorry.
This is,
I'm just,
you know,</v>

1152
01:13:07.430 --> 01:13:10.230
maybe a little bit of a cipher,
but you are at Google.
Um,

1153
01:13:10.520 --> 01:13:14.000
have you thought about your competition being silicon?
I.
E.

1154
01:13:14.150 --> 01:13:17.300
We're just going to upload our consciousness to a computer at some point.

1155
01:13:17.690 --> 01:13:21.210
<v 4>You know,
I mean if it works then you know,</v>

1156
01:13:22.480 --> 01:13:27.280
so much the better.
But at this point it's still looked pretty hard.
I mean,
if,

1157
01:13:27.340 --> 01:13:31.160
if we're lucky,
if we do end up being able to develop really good,
um,

1158
01:13:31.680 --> 01:13:32.640
we can be through interfacing,

1159
01:13:32.641 --> 01:13:37.641
still allow a really high fidelity training of the next time we'll Brian from an

1160
01:13:38.021 --> 01:13:40.240
internal one from it,
from a natural one.
So on,

1161
01:13:40.420 --> 01:13:42.220
then we could be talking something realistic,

1162
01:13:42.221 --> 01:13:43.780
but at the moment it seems to be a long way off.

1163
01:13:45.070 --> 01:13:47.350
<v 3>Following up on that,
I'm also a huge site by fan.</v>

1164
01:13:47.410 --> 01:13:51.460
I was wondering if it's possible to use your research for long distance space

1165
01:13:51.461 --> 01:13:52.450
travel for NASA.

1166
01:13:52.820 --> 01:13:53.653
<v 4>Oh sure.
Of course.</v>

1167
01:13:53.810 --> 01:13:57.930
I mean the thing about longest suspension travel,

1168
01:13:57.940 --> 01:14:02.660
if it takes a long time and um,
you might not want to be awake all that time if,

1169
01:14:02.661 --> 01:14:05.990
if,
if you,
if your big thing is to just the stars,

1170
01:14:06.020 --> 01:14:10.700
maybe you prefer to be quiet reserved.
I'm up for that too.
But um,
yeah,

1171
01:14:10.730 --> 01:14:12.920
personally happy down here.
Yep.

1172
01:14:13.330 --> 01:14:14.050
<v 7>Okay.
I'm sorry.</v>

1173
01:14:14.050 --> 01:14:19.050
There is a 2015 article in some magazine or the head researcher says Elizabeth

1174
01:14:20.820 --> 01:14:24.430
Blackburn talking about the shortening of Tim or link and their observation is

1175
01:14:24.431 --> 01:14:28.300
that that's not the driving factor in the rate of aging and each cells,
uh,

1176
01:14:28.301 --> 01:14:31.600
that it's more related to [inaudible] activity.
Is this,

1177
01:14:31.630 --> 01:14:35.200
you kind of covered this in your question,
your answer a couple of times ago,
but,

1178
01:14:35.620 --> 01:14:38.830
um,
does that,
uh,
I mean,

1179
01:14:40.180 --> 01:14:43.660
does taking that into account all to your team or thread or anything?
Yeah,

1180
01:14:44.070 --> 01:14:48.880
<v 4>no
Nobel prize for this work on telomerase a long time ago.
Um,</v>

1181
01:14:48.950 --> 01:14:51.810
she's obviously a very prominent researcher in this area.
You see,

1182
01:14:51.830 --> 01:14:56.550
definitely very interested in the role that telomere shortening could have in an

1183
01:14:56.660 --> 01:14:57.830
aging.
Um,

1184
01:14:58.250 --> 01:15:02.450
most of what she'd actually been able to report more on the level of correlation

1185
01:15:02.451 --> 01:15:05.060
and causation.
Um,
you know,
for example,

1186
01:15:05.061 --> 01:15:09.440
that people who have suffered a lot of stress tend to have shorter telomeres.

1187
01:15:09.441 --> 01:15:13.970
We don't know which way around it went.
Um,
and I think that that,
uh,
but,
um,

1188
01:15:14.360 --> 01:15:15.740
but yeah,
I mean like be kind of what I said.

1189
01:15:18.780 --> 01:15:20.220
Are we running out of time?
Okay.

1190
01:15:20.750 --> 01:15:24.800
<v 8>Yeah.
I have a question about a diet.
Um,
so basically,
um,</v>

1191
01:15:24.860 --> 01:15:28.930
earlier you mentioned that you can use a status too.
Um,

1192
01:15:28.940 --> 01:15:32.840
I think this is basically to reduce the cholesterol in the blood,
but a,

1193
01:15:32.841 --> 01:15:37.220
I believe it is a at least two research sites that have quite strong about

1194
01:15:37.670 --> 01:15:42.590
reducing the incidents of attra sclerosis just by changing the Diet and uh,

1195
01:15:42.680 --> 01:15:46.640
it does not have the side effects that a student has and also increases all

1196
01:15:46.660 --> 01:15:49.240
course.
Oh,
decreases outcomes,
mortality.

1197
01:15:49.250 --> 01:15:54.170
So basically I think what was earlier claimed that one cannot change the life

1198
01:15:54.171 --> 01:15:56.930
expectancy a currently is not true,

1199
01:15:57.010 --> 01:15:59.930
but I'm not saying it's not the age related stuff,

1200
01:15:59.931 --> 01:16:03.170
but it's the stuff that's in your third column there which can actually be

1201
01:16:03.171 --> 01:16:04.004
addressed.

1202
01:16:04.480 --> 01:16:07.900
<v 4>We're very careful with their studies,
so sure if Claire,</v>

1203
01:16:07.901 --> 01:16:12.190
that atherosclerosis is as the seed of western diet,

1204
01:16:12.350 --> 01:16:16.510
it's very much more prevalent now than it used to be.
Um,

1205
01:16:16.750 --> 01:16:20.890
but if you look at the actual life expectancy fee aspect,
then,

1206
01:16:20.891 --> 01:16:24.410
if not very encouraging.
If we didn't get it,

1207
01:16:24.411 --> 01:16:26.710
if we have completely eliminated all heart attacks and stroke,

1208
01:16:27.220 --> 01:16:31.260
then we only live about five years longer.
If we 100% eliminated.
But,

1209
01:16:31.680 --> 01:16:35.910
and of course they've kind of to,
I don't by any means at 100% eliminated.

1210
01:16:36.310 --> 01:16:38.890
So we're still talking a very small amount of difference in terms of life

1211
01:16:38.891 --> 01:16:39.460
expected.

1212
01:16:39.460 --> 01:16:40.293
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

1213
01:16:43.160 --> 01:16:44.780
<v 4>Yup.
All right.
Thanks very much everybody.</v>

1214
01:16:45.090 --> 01:16:48.940
<v 0>[inaudible].</v>
