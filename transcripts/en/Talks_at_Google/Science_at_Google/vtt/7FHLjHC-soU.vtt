1
00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:06.430
Look,

2
00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:10.180
I'm hoping that we can spend most of our times a day and discussion rather than

3
00:00:10.181 --> 00:00:11.860
with me just talking on my own.

4
00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:16.000
I've got a few slides because I might want to pull up some couldn't quotations,

5
00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.920
um,
not as the basis for a full tour.
But I will say a little to begin.

6
00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:24.420
So I had two basic points.
Um,

7
00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:27.100
first people keep saying that consciousness is a mystery,

8
00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:31.930
but it isn't a matter is mysterious,
but consciousness isn't.

9
00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:37.030
And second point is there's that to literally nothing in science that gives us

10
00:00:37.031 --> 00:00:42.031
any reason to doubt the reality of consciousness or to think that it is anything

11
00:00:42.071 --> 00:00:43.480
other than it's seems.

12
00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:46.930
So if anybody doubts whether either of those two claims is true,

13
00:00:46.931 --> 00:00:49.970
we'll have something to talk about.
But it's very difficult with audiences.

14
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.950
Could you just don't know,

15
00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:56.560
there's increasing tribalism in this debate too is people are very entrenched.

16
00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:01.480
So I don't expect to be able to convince anybody if they've already been led to

17
00:01:01.481 --> 00:01:05.620
think otherwise.
So that's my optimistic prognostic.

18
00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:09.180
But to begin,
most of us who think about consciousness,

19
00:01:09.181 --> 00:01:11.230
he states are committed naturalists.

20
00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:14.440
We don't think that just means we don't think there's anything supernatural or

21
00:01:14.441 --> 00:01:15.610
otherwise.
Non-Natural.

22
00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:21.330
Most of us were also of all out physicalist or materialist studies.

23
00:01:21.581 --> 00:01:25.360
We think that everything in the universe is wholly physical.
And I do myself,

24
00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:32.050
um,
I hope that most of us are also clear on the point that that is color

25
00:01:32.051 --> 00:01:32.884
experience.

26
00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:36.790
Let's see if I've got some kind of absurd that I have to produce some,

27
00:01:36.791 --> 00:01:39.220
but because you are having it already,
but

28
00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:41.173
<v 1>mmm.</v>

29
00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.880
<v 0>Um,
taste experience and patient experience.
And I hope that most of us,</v>

30
00:01:46.881 --> 00:01:47.331
and I admit,

31
00:01:47.331 --> 00:01:51.170
I don't know how things stand in this room are all are realists about color,

32
00:01:51.171 --> 00:01:53.000
experience,
taste,
experience,
and so on.

33
00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.540
Just like the other 7.5 billion people on the planet,

34
00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:02.930
we should be realistic because the existence of conscious experience is the most

35
00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:08.360
and
got it.
Something's gone wrong.
I think the most certain,

36
00:02:08.361 --> 00:02:11.640
you know,
in general,
natural,
natural fact about reality,

37
00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.390
you can doubt almost anything,
the existence of the external world,

38
00:02:15.391 --> 00:02:18.360
but you can't really doubt the fact that you're having conscious experience

39
00:02:18.361 --> 00:02:20.580
right now.
I know that some,

40
00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.900
yes,
that
you hear me.
Yeah,

41
00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.860
sorry.
Yeah.
If something's going on and off,
I don't know why

42
00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:35.100
you'll have to bear with me for the moment.

43
00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.640
There are familiar thought experiments that make the point that you can doubt

44
00:02:38.641 --> 00:02:41.250
the existence of the external world.
You might for example,

45
00:02:41.251 --> 00:02:43.260
be a focal brain in a vat.

46
00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:45.630
<v 1>Oh,
okay.</v>

47
00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:52.480
<v 0>Being fair to seamless world,
uh,
world simulation or if some of you will know,</v>

48
00:02:52.481 --> 00:02:57.481
you might be a wholly computationally realized subject of experience in them in

49
00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:01.150
a Bostrom and Nick Bostrom world simulation and so on.

50
00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:05.290
But you can't doubt that at least it seems to you that you're having experience

51
00:03:05.291 --> 00:03:10.291
right now of seeing me and hearing me talk and for it to seem to you that you're

52
00:03:10.571 --> 00:03:13.330
having experienced just is for you to be having experience.

53
00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:18.070
The seeming is made of experience.
It is already a form of conscious experience.

54
00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:22.090
Well,
I'm using the word I'd like to take it that,
you know what I mean?

55
00:03:22.091 --> 00:03:25.150
When I say consciousness or conscious experience or experience,

56
00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:27.100
I mean the qualitative,

57
00:03:27.101 --> 00:03:32.101
what it is like of everyday experience seeing scarlet or tasting Tahini.

58
00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:39.030
The trouble is that words like consciousness have been full barred in men in so

59
00:03:39.281 --> 00:03:43.600
many different ways in recent discussion that they become almost useless.

60
00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:49.090
Some people have done what I like to call,
they've reversified or looking glass.

61
00:03:49.091 --> 00:03:52.840
The word consciousness where to reversify or looking glass.

62
00:03:52.841 --> 00:03:57.340
A word is to use it in such a way that whatever one means by it,

63
00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:01.830
it excludes what it actually means.
And from where I stand down,

64
00:04:01.831 --> 00:04:05.740
then it has done exactly that.
He has looking glass,
the word consciousness.

65
00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:11.740
Some of you will have come across the word quality.
There's plural qualia,
qualia,

66
00:04:11.741 --> 00:04:12.574
Qualia.

67
00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:16.810
It's used as a general name for all the distinctive what it's likenesses of

68
00:04:16.811 --> 00:04:20.980
experience,
sound experience,
smell,
experience,
taste,
experience,

69
00:04:20.981 --> 00:04:25.981
experience of red versus experience of green versus experience of Purple C.

70
00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:31.680
Uh,
and pretty exciting,
Huh?

71
00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:37.360
A headache versus stomachache or nausea.
So on.

72
00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:42.210
It seems to be kind of obligatory dimensional orgasm in these contexts.

73
00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:43.930
So there you are.
I had done my duty,

74
00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:48.750
I've always avoided using the word Qualia,
um,

75
00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:53.020
for various complicated reasons in philosophical debate.

76
00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:55.600
But I'm going to use it now because I think there's less argument about what it

77
00:04:55.601 --> 00:04:56.434
means,

78
00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:01.330
what the argument is about is whether Qualia exist and although I think that's

79
00:05:01.331 --> 00:05:03.220
crazy,
it is at least clear.

80
00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:08.620
I know that a few philosophers deny that qualia exist and that a few

81
00:05:08.621 --> 00:05:11.710
psychologists do and reports have reached me.

82
00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:16.860
That is also true of some people in who work in AI or it take him in the largest

83
00:05:17.651 --> 00:05:21.640
sense where this includes people who work at August institutions like Google.

84
00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:23.770
Well I think,

85
00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:27.760
and I like to say that the denial that Qualia exist,

86
00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:31.390
the denial that consciousness exists where consciousness is understood in the

87
00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:36.430
ordinary sense that denial is the silliest thing that has ever been said in the

88
00:05:36.431 --> 00:05:38.320
whole history of the human race.

89
00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:42.790
In my experience is many philosophers who say this silly thing,

90
00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:46.780
but I'm worried that the habit is spreading and this is what we may have to talk

91
00:05:46.781 --> 00:05:49.600
about.
So here we are rather,
here I am,

92
00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:54.320
I declare myself to be a good naturalist,
passionate naturalist,

93
00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:58.050
a full on no nonsense materialist who thinks that everything in the university

94
00:05:58.051 --> 00:05:58.884
is physical.

95
00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:03.350
Who Thinks of conscious experience is wholly a matter of goings on in the brain

96
00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:08.510
and who also thinks knows for sure that there are qualia experiences and many

97
00:06:08.511 --> 00:06:10.370
different kinds.
And that's the issue.

98
00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:13.310
Some people think that this race is a problem.

99
00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:18.420
They think that you can't be a ride on naturalists,

100
00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:23.180
materialists and at the same time be an all out realist about conscious

101
00:06:23.181 --> 00:06:24.290
experience and Qualia.

102
00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:29.300
Fortunately this isn't so there is no conflict.

103
00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:32.840
There's no conflict of any sort,
no stress,

104
00:06:32.841 --> 00:06:37.841
no tension between being an all our materialist or naturalist as hard nose as

105
00:06:38.991 --> 00:06:43.991
you like and fully acknowledging the reality of conscious experience of Qualia,

106
00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:48.560
of experiential,
what it is like,
but full on stereo,
technicolor,

107
00:06:48.561 --> 00:06:50.240
multimodal show.

108
00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:53.660
The idea that these two things,

109
00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:58.670
material is naturalism and following consciousness are incompatible so that you

110
00:06:58.671 --> 00:07:01.700
can't have both is just a mistake.

111
00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:03.830
It's a very large mistake.

112
00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:09.020
The truth is that you can't really be a naturalist at all.

113
00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:11.360
A real naturalist.

114
00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:17.360
You can't be a remotely realistic naturalist and not acknowledge the existence

115
00:07:17.361 --> 00:07:21.760
of following consciousness.
Why not?
Because it's the most certainly known.
Uh,

116
00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.740
and obviously holy natural thing.
There is

117
00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:31.910
a,
so how did anyone ever get to deny the existence of consciousness or Qualia?

118
00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:33.033
Um,

119
00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:37.310
that is made what I believe to be the silliest claim that has ever been made in

120
00:07:37.311 --> 00:07:40.730
the whole history of human thought.
Well,

121
00:07:40.731 --> 00:07:43.280
I really don't want to antagonize anyone.
Well,

122
00:07:43.281 --> 00:07:45.080
I don't really see how I can avoid it,

123
00:07:45.081 --> 00:07:49.970
so I may as well now my colors to the mast.
Um,
and you know,

124
00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:54.170
the people that I'm opposed to our philosophy is I just don't know how it is out

125
00:07:54.171 --> 00:07:59.120
there in the real world.
Um,
we need to anatomize this mistake a bit.

126
00:07:59.630 --> 00:08:03.140
It is among other things and perhaps centrally mistake about physics,

127
00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:07.940
about all physical sciences is generally about what physics is and does more

128
00:08:07.941 --> 00:08:08.301
broadly.

129
00:08:08.301 --> 00:08:12.170
It's the mistake of thinking we know more about the nature of the physical world

130
00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:15.030
then we do.
And actually that did,

131
00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:19.400
it is interestingly a recent mistake upon,

132
00:08:19.460 --> 00:08:24.460
among materialists as recently as the 1950s almost no materialists made it.

133
00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:26.781
There were many,

134
00:08:26.781 --> 00:08:31.781
many convinced materialists or physicalist if you like back then how all out

135
00:08:32.601 --> 00:08:37.601
hardnosed materialists with nose as hard as you like stretching back to two and

136
00:08:37.941 --> 00:08:39.020
a half thousand years.

137
00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:43.730
None of them were so foolish as to deny the existence of conscious experience,

138
00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:48.080
the existence of the thing whose existence is more certain than the existence of

139
00:08:48.081 --> 00:08:53.000
anything else.
So as I keep saying,
I'm a materialist myself,

140
00:08:53.001 --> 00:08:55.980
I believe that everything that exists in universities physical,

141
00:08:56.160 --> 00:09:00.150
so buying the physical,
I just mean everything that exists in the universe.

142
00:09:00.210 --> 00:09:04.860
And so of course I think that consciousness is wholly physical.
Um,

143
00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:06.053
Qualia.

144
00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:11.240
I don't think that physics can express or descriptively characterize everything

145
00:09:11.581 --> 00:09:15.930
that exists,
but thinking that is no part of being a materialist.

146
00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:18.090
That's where some people go wrong.

147
00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:22.590
And materialistic again is just someone who thinks that everything that exists

148
00:09:22.591 --> 00:09:26.070
is physical and no one Aye.
Aye.

149
00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:31.050
I propose no one who understands what's physics is thinks that physics can

150
00:09:31.051 --> 00:09:35.040
express or descriptively characterize everything that exists.

151
00:09:35.780 --> 00:09:38.970
This is because they know with,
for example,

152
00:09:38.971 --> 00:09:42.630
Stephen Hawking that physics,
and I quote him,

153
00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:46.200
physics is just a set of rules.
And Equations.

154
00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:49.920
They know that physics has nothing,

155
00:09:49.950 --> 00:09:54.950
absolutely nothing to say to the question of the ultimate intrinsic nature of

156
00:09:55.831 --> 00:09:59.130
the staff that satisfies the rules and equations.

157
00:09:59.490 --> 00:10:03.330
Over and above saying that it satisfies those rules and equations.

158
00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:08.910
They know that physics just isn't in the business of answering the question and

159
00:10:08.911 --> 00:10:11.910
this is Hawkings words again,
the question,

160
00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:16.890
what is it that breathes fire into the equations and makes a universe for them

161
00:10:16.891 --> 00:10:20.670
to describe?
Let me try and get to my,

162
00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:25.110
they know so I want to quote,
Oh,
here he is.
Russell.

163
00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:29.610
I'm very keen on Russell.
It's been forgotten recently,

164
00:10:29.611 --> 00:10:33.600
but he's coming back.
I hope so.
They know with Russell that I quote,

165
00:10:33.630 --> 00:10:38.630
a physics in itself is extremely abstract and reveals only certain mathematical

166
00:10:39.181 --> 00:10:42.180
characteristics of the material with which it deals.

167
00:10:42.181 --> 00:10:47.181
It does not tell us anything as to the intrinsic nature of this material

168
00:10:48.750 --> 00:10:49.531
at moment.
He says,

169
00:10:49.531 --> 00:10:54.030
we realize this abstractness but it doesn't make its do impression because

170
00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:57.600
imagination reassert itself.
As soon as we're off,

171
00:10:57.601 --> 00:11:01.170
our guard here is again matter,

172
00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:02.820
quote marks around.

173
00:11:02.821 --> 00:11:07.440
It is only an is known only as regards certain very abstract characteristics,

174
00:11:08.490 --> 00:11:10.500
which might by physics that is,

175
00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:14.610
which might quite well belonged to a manifold of mental events but might also

176
00:11:14.611 --> 00:11:16.110
belong to a different manifold.

177
00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:23.010
It's necessary to emphasize the Stream Lee abstract character of physical

178
00:11:23.011 --> 00:11:27.660
knowledge and the fact that physics leaves open all kinds of possibilities as to

179
00:11:27.661 --> 00:11:30.780
the intrinsic character of the world to which it's equations apply.

180
00:11:31.890 --> 00:11:32.760
And he says,

181
00:11:32.850 --> 00:11:37.850
I'm interested in the materialism has been guilty unconsciously and in spite of

182
00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:44.960
explicit disavow walls of a confusion in it's imaginative picture of matter.

183
00:11:47.071 --> 00:11:51.630
And I think that that's,
um,
that's afflicts all of us.

184
00:11:51.631 --> 00:11:56.380
Most of us,
most of the time adjust,
not able to overcome that confusion.

185
00:11:56.381 --> 00:12:00.430
We think we can't help thinking we know more about the intrinsic nature of

186
00:12:00.431 --> 00:12:05.020
matter then we do.
Um,
so,

187
00:12:05.021 --> 00:12:07.930
uh,
I think at the Russell is right about the nature of physics.

188
00:12:08.020 --> 00:12:11.590
He's also right that we find it very hard not to slip back into thinking that we

189
00:12:11.591 --> 00:12:14.020
know more than we do about matter.

190
00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:18.100
And then coming to things that matter,
can't be conscious,

191
00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:21.130
can't give rise to consciousness or qualia.

192
00:12:23.950 --> 00:12:26.320
Okay,
well that's a big mistake.
That's a fatal mistake.

193
00:12:27.140 --> 00:12:31.450
The mistake again is to think that we know anything about matter or physical

194
00:12:31.451 --> 00:12:36.130
stuff that generally,
that gives us good reason to think that consciousness,

195
00:12:36.970 --> 00:12:40.690
conscious experience,
Qualia can't be wholly physical.

196
00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:46.540
One point,
I don't know if it's going to come up because I can't control my,

197
00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:50.490
Oh yeah.
Now I've got some rude remarks about philosophers.
Uh,

198
00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:55.180
I'll just leave them up there and,
um,
absolutely true.

199
00:12:55.420 --> 00:13:00.340
All of them.
Uh,
I'm not saying other people are better,
but,
um,

200
00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:01.721
Russell again,

201
00:13:01.721 --> 00:13:05.890
we now realize I'm quoting that we know nothing of the intrinsic quality of

202
00:13:05.891 --> 00:13:10.891
physical phenomena except when they happen to be sensations and that therefore

203
00:13:11.591 --> 00:13:14.440
there is no reason to be surprised at.
Some are sensations.

204
00:13:14.441 --> 00:13:18.880
So there's a very explicit endorsement of the claim that the qualitative,

205
00:13:19.390 --> 00:13:23.320
what it is,
like he's literally physical,
physical stuff.
You could say.

206
00:13:24.140 --> 00:13:28.450
And this is extremely startling if you've had a sort of conventional upbringing.

207
00:13:28.930 --> 00:13:31.960
Um,
when you get this,
when you really get this,

208
00:13:32.470 --> 00:13:36.310
you're on the verge in my view of becoming a real naturalist or real

209
00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:40.120
materialist.
Um,
what are your chances of getting this,

210
00:13:40.690 --> 00:13:45.550
of becoming a real materialist?
Um,
if you've had this conventional upbringing?

211
00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:48.730
I just think they're not great if you've already been tempted to deny

212
00:13:48.731 --> 00:13:52.660
consciousness in any way.
It depends on how open minded you are.

213
00:13:53.380 --> 00:13:54.760
And most of us aren't.
I mean,

214
00:13:54.780 --> 00:13:59.780
I fully admit that I had a kind of revelation 25 years ago when I finally got

215
00:14:01.301 --> 00:14:01.910
it.

216
00:14:01.910 --> 00:14:06.360
Are there so imprinted on this picture of matter as this clunky stuff that is

217
00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:09.250
intrinsically nonconscious?
Uh,

218
00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:12.040
may many of us imprint on what we are taught early on.

219
00:14:12.130 --> 00:14:14.940
We feel the need for closure.
Um,

220
00:14:14.950 --> 00:14:17.710
the psychologist and social psychologists have a nice term for this.

221
00:14:17.710 --> 00:14:18.940
We seize and freeze.

222
00:14:19.930 --> 00:14:22.690
We see some of you and then we freeze out further thought about it.

223
00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:26.530
We polarize and we tribalized with great intensity.

224
00:14:27.550 --> 00:14:31.090
I'm nearly done with,
um,
but people,
I claim,
you know,

225
00:14:31.091 --> 00:14:33.580
something about what physics is now with Addington.

226
00:14:34.390 --> 00:14:38.980
It's very old point that physics has nothing to say about what he calls.

227
00:14:38.981 --> 00:14:43.981
I quote in 1928 the and get actable nature of the physical.

228
00:14:46.060 --> 00:14:49.420
They know this well whether or not they think which Schrodinger for example,

229
00:14:49.421 --> 00:14:53.750
and I quote the material universe and consciousness I made out of the same stuff

230
00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:57.080
or whether they think with Max Planck for example,

231
00:14:57.100 --> 00:15:01.220
a quote that consciousness is fundamental and matter is derivative from

232
00:15:01.221 --> 00:15:01.821
consciousness.

233
00:15:01.821 --> 00:15:05.510
I'm not sure I put it that way or whether they know with the debris,

234
00:15:06.470 --> 00:15:07.670
the wave function guy,

235
00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:11.810
I quote that consciousness and matter a different aspects of one and the same

236
00:15:11.811 --> 00:15:15.360
thing I quote again,
he the boy this,

237
00:15:15.420 --> 00:15:18.890
the aspect of this substance that we examined by scientific methods is what we

238
00:15:18.891 --> 00:15:23.330
call matter.
The other aspect of which we obtain knowledge,
not scientifically,

239
00:15:23.331 --> 00:15:26.030
but directly is what we call consciousness.

240
00:15:26.690 --> 00:15:30.020
And Lawrence with whom Einstein fully agrees says,

241
00:15:30.021 --> 00:15:33.230
and I quote the mental and the material of two sides of the same thing.

242
00:15:34.110 --> 00:15:38.360
And the key here is that physics and being just a set of rules of equations.

243
00:15:38.380 --> 00:15:42.710
It doesn't rule that out in any way.
And since we know there's consciousness,

244
00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:46.130
the door is now wide open for us to,
to reconcile.

245
00:15:48.270 --> 00:15:53.240
Okay.
Uh,
this mistake has gone very deep in some people.

246
00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:59.210
And I mean characteristically when you got used to a certain use of word or a

247
00:15:59.211 --> 00:16:03.490
certain way of thinking,
you just can't really hear the other view.
Um,

248
00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:04.850
and some people,

249
00:16:04.940 --> 00:16:09.320
there's also a kind of rebellious attraction to the deny the existence of

250
00:16:09.321 --> 00:16:10.550
consciousness in one way or another.

251
00:16:10.551 --> 00:16:15.110
You kind of feel brave or heroic or intellectually fearless.

252
00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:17.390
Um,
well that's fine.

253
00:16:17.420 --> 00:16:21.530
But I think it's also sad because you're really so lost when you do that.

254
00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:23.600
Uh,
okay,
look,

255
00:16:23.601 --> 00:16:27.470
I'm just going to stop and I'm going to hope someone has some objection or tells

256
00:16:27.471 --> 00:16:29.630
me I'm wrong or something.
Yeah.

257
00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:31.210
<v 2>Good.
I can do that.</v>

258
00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:34.450
And I've read some Dennett and he was here a while back and mirrored him talk.

259
00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:38.910
Yeah.
And uh,
I don't necessarily feel qualified to like state his position.
Um,

260
00:16:39.070 --> 00:16:41.620
at least from what I've read and what I've heard from him.
Um,

261
00:16:41.650 --> 00:16:45.550
I feel like he talks a lot about certain specific things that people take for

262
00:16:45.551 --> 00:16:50.551
granted as part of their conscious experience and often does it makes a strong

263
00:16:50.621 --> 00:16:53.980
case that they're not quite true,
even if it goes to forest,
a lack of quality.

264
00:16:53.981 --> 00:16:57.460
Yeah.
It's like,
for example,
I subjectively experienced my life is continuous.

265
00:16:57.610 --> 00:17:00.070
I subjectively experience myself as a single entity,

266
00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:03.760
but you can quibble a lot about what it means to be a single entity if there's

267
00:17:03.761 --> 00:17:05.270
no point where all information,
you know,

268
00:17:05.271 --> 00:17:08.410
it kind of comes together and you can quibble a lot about the continuity of

269
00:17:08.411 --> 00:17:11.740
conscious experience when it shuts off every night or when you know,

270
00:17:11.750 --> 00:17:14.920
it like parts of my brain kind of like reset and start over every few minutes.

271
00:17:15.250 --> 00:17:17.080
And I feel like that's to some degree,

272
00:17:17.081 --> 00:17:19.810
that's the stronger element of his are to say about that.

273
00:17:20.090 --> 00:17:20.871
<v 0>Yeah,
I do.
Yeah.</v>

274
00:17:20.871 --> 00:17:23.360
I use that a lot of things that I'm not sure if they couldn't remember them all

275
00:17:23.361 --> 00:17:27.980
already.
But,
um,
I mean you were saying you're a biological single thing,
right?

276
00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:32.030
So that's when you said that it's somehow allude what you meant,

277
00:17:32.970 --> 00:17:36.040
<v 2>right.
It's about,
about like the me being like a single entity.
Yes.</v>

278
00:17:36.041 --> 00:17:38.410
So it's more about the fact that like the brain is,
you know,

279
00:17:38.450 --> 00:17:39.620
really heavily distributed.

280
00:17:39.621 --> 00:17:43.340
So like I experienced myself as in like a very narrative form of like I'm a

281
00:17:43.341 --> 00:17:45.330
person,
I make decisions,
I take actions.

282
00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:49.440
<v 0>Yeah,
no,
I'm actually on the issue of that as it were,</v>

283
00:17:49.441 --> 00:17:52.440
that narrative conceptions of self being very much construction.

284
00:17:52.650 --> 00:17:56.190
I actually felt deeply agree with Dennis and I think he's very subtle and

285
00:17:56.191 --> 00:17:58.860
interesting about that.
Uh,
but I really,

286
00:18:00.270 --> 00:18:03.180
I really like to restrict it as much as possible to the really basic issue,

287
00:18:03.181 --> 00:18:06.620
which is just qualia.
Because I would say that,
I mean,

288
00:18:07.110 --> 00:18:08.310
I don't know whether any of you know,

289
00:18:08.311 --> 00:18:12.840
but I wrote a piece lots month on the New York review blog,

290
00:18:13.470 --> 00:18:16.360
um,
say say about the silliest claims,

291
00:18:16.361 --> 00:18:20.640
the denial contracts and Dennett replied about 10 days ago.

292
00:18:20.970 --> 00:18:25.290
And then I replied to him,
we had,
and I,

293
00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:30.600
I think I've gathered enough quotations,
I think to show that he does.

294
00:18:30.990 --> 00:18:32.070
He's right.
He's,

295
00:18:32.100 --> 00:18:35.820
he's an extremist in the sense that he denies the existence of qualitative

296
00:18:35.821 --> 00:18:40.821
character of the sort that I'm claiming that I know you have when I get up one

297
00:18:41.161 --> 00:18:44.850
of those colors.
And again,
I want to say something like I shouldn't have,

298
00:18:44.910 --> 00:18:49.620
it's silly in a way that I'm doing this bringing up a color because I've

299
00:18:49.621 --> 00:18:52.750
actually got a a spray out.
If I was,

300
00:18:52.900 --> 00:18:57.270
I'm tempted to kind of spray a certain
odor,

301
00:18:57.450 --> 00:19:00.540
I mean a nice one in the room and then see that,

302
00:19:00.810 --> 00:19:04.470
get you to recognize it and then ask you how you did that.
But I won't.
Um,

303
00:19:04.530 --> 00:19:06.630
so can we keep to that?
So

304
00:19:06.870 --> 00:19:11.040
<v 2>do you think you can give a,
are really like precise definition of like how you,</v>

305
00:19:11.470 --> 00:19:11.861
are you,

306
00:19:11.861 --> 00:19:15.280
are you in Denny using the same definition for the term Kalia and like can be

307
00:19:15.281 --> 00:19:16.610
really precise about what that definitely,

308
00:19:18.350 --> 00:19:21.050
<v 0>I think we are,
that's why I mean would definitely not use it.</v>

309
00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:25.410
We definitely define consciousness in different ways because he,
I mean,
I could,

310
00:19:25.460 --> 00:19:30.440
I would,
I I'd like to try and pull up some quotations.
He famously says,
look,

311
00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:33.380
in his reply to me,
I could read you some quotations.
He says,

312
00:19:34.780 --> 00:19:38.090
I quote Dennett,
I don't deny the existence of consciousness.

313
00:19:38.150 --> 00:19:42.530
Of course consciousness exists.
It just isn't what most people think it is.

314
00:19:43.310 --> 00:19:46.640
Um,
but he also says things like,
do you know what?

315
00:19:46.670 --> 00:19:50.210
Does everyone know what a Zombie is?
In the,
in the,
in the,

316
00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:52.880
in the sort of semi technical philosophical sense,

317
00:19:53.290 --> 00:19:58.290
a Zombie is a creature that is outwardly and behaviourally indistinguishable

318
00:19:59.151 --> 00:20:03.230
from a normal human being but has no consciousness in the,

319
00:20:03.620 --> 00:20:05.930
in what we think,
what I think of as the everyday sense.

320
00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:10.130
And then at one point says we're all zombies.
That is,
we,

321
00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:15.110
there is really no in our what it is like there at all.
Uh,
for him,

322
00:20:15.111 --> 00:20:18.380
consciousness is just a functional term.
It means you're very,
you know,

323
00:20:18.650 --> 00:20:21.200
you see the velocity raptor.
If it comes at you,

324
00:20:21.201 --> 00:20:23.240
you go through the door in the right kind of way.

325
00:20:23.390 --> 00:20:28.390
Consciousness is awareness of your surroundings of the thought that in principle

326
00:20:28.820 --> 00:20:32.360
a super duper robot could have.
He's,
I think he's unequivocal about that.

327
00:20:33.020 --> 00:20:36.860
So we don't,
we completely disagree.
When we used with consciousness.

328
00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:39.340
I think he then,
but he,

329
00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:43.820
that's why I liked the term qualia because he'd finds it quite carefully,
um,

330
00:20:43.940 --> 00:20:48.940
as the kind of touchy feely real thing that I mean and I'm sure I believe you

331
00:20:49.031 --> 00:20:53.050
will know what I mean.
And then he says that doesn't exist.
That's an illusion.

332
00:20:53.051 --> 00:20:53.884
That's his word.

333
00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:59.960
So are you willing to go with him there quite go.

334
00:21:00.190 --> 00:21:05.090
I'm going to yield to this guy for a bit.
Yeah.
Briefly.
Do you them,

335
00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:09.190
do you think that this is related to the distinction between being and becoming

336
00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:12.910
or static or dynamic?
Like there's salt and the saltiness.

337
00:21:13.090 --> 00:21:15.250
Salt is sodium and chloride.

338
00:21:15.430 --> 00:21:19.970
Saltiness isn't a thing you can put your finger on.
I don't,

339
00:21:20.650 --> 00:21:23.770
I don't actually think I hadn't ordered,
it never occurred to me.

340
00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:28.660
Um,
I do want one,

341
00:21:28.661 --> 00:21:31.040
I talk about quality of character.
I,

342
00:21:31.190 --> 00:21:36.190
I do really want to mean the thing that's actually live occurrent clockable

343
00:21:36.551 --> 00:21:40.840
happening right now to you.
So there is a more abstract notion of,
you know,

344
00:21:41.380 --> 00:21:45.000
SAP green or whatever that is is that it's more like saltiness,

345
00:21:45.010 --> 00:21:50.010
but I really want does that correspond to told what I was meaning for example is

346
00:21:50.441 --> 00:21:55.441
people could say there's as farm say 700 nanometer wavelength.

347
00:21:55.471 --> 00:21:59.180
Yeah.
Right.
And there's what I'm feeling when I personally look at it.

348
00:21:59.180 --> 00:22:01.660
So I wasn't thinking of that either.
Of course.

349
00:22:01.661 --> 00:22:06.340
I mean I agree that if you want to give 'em as it were a scientific definition

350
00:22:06.341 --> 00:22:10.690
of color,
you're going to do it in terms of a surface reflectance properties.

351
00:22:11.260 --> 00:22:12.093
And actually the,

352
00:22:12.340 --> 00:22:17.140
the physics of color and reflecting is incredibly got weird and complicated.
But,

353
00:22:17.580 --> 00:22:19.170
um,
I wasn't thinking of that.

354
00:22:19.171 --> 00:22:23.080
I'm really only talking about the subjective qualitative,

355
00:22:23.170 --> 00:22:25.800
what it is like that you have.
And of course it's a fun,

356
00:22:25.890 --> 00:22:30.370
it's a famous and familiar thought experiment.
Let me do my,
let me ask you,

357
00:22:30.670 --> 00:22:33.250
how many people is,
kids wondered,

358
00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:37.690
ever wonder whether when they looked at something like that,
someone else,

359
00:22:37.990 --> 00:22:42.520
one of their friends was having a qualitatively different experience and give me

360
00:22:42.521 --> 00:22:46.690
some hand.
Yeah.
Okay.
Oh,
you're actually,
when I asked classes about this,

361
00:22:46.691 --> 00:22:50.560
I get about 50% I think I got slightly more.
So it must be a sort of nerd thing.

362
00:22:52.580 --> 00:22:53.780
Okay.
But some,

363
00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:56.710
so you don't think that that kind of distinction is one of the reasons for this

364
00:22:56.711 --> 00:23:01.300
error or how would it,
how would it work?
It's like saying for example,

365
00:23:01.301 --> 00:23:01.601
they're like,

366
00:23:01.601 --> 00:23:06.601
well I don't think quality exists because there's not some atoms or something.

367
00:23:08.081 --> 00:23:13.030
What is it?
It's some process or what do you mean by that?
I see.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.

368
00:23:13.270 --> 00:23:16.130
That's,
there are so many problems with words.
Um,

369
00:23:16.180 --> 00:23:20.770
all I mean is you're having a certain experience right now.

370
00:23:21.580 --> 00:23:24.970
It,
and it,
it is clockable it's happening in these,

371
00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:30.000
during these seconds and it has a certain quality of character and that isn't

372
00:23:30.221 --> 00:23:35.080
abstract in any way.
It's just part of the,
the beating of your experience.

373
00:23:35.081 --> 00:23:39.400
It's real.
It's concrete.
Totally concrete.
So that's how I would reply.

374
00:23:39.940 --> 00:23:43.210
And I would hope that they are,
I don't know what the other person,

375
00:23:43.450 --> 00:23:47.000
the other person would say at that point,
but I just mean that,
I mean the,

376
00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:48.830
the real happening thing,

377
00:23:50.060 --> 00:23:55.040
the thing that's happening to a baby.
Right.
Okay.
Okay.

378
00:23:56.410 --> 00:23:59.260
<v 3>Yeah.
Um,
so back to Dennett,
uh,</v>

379
00:23:59.261 --> 00:24:03.520
he was here and I directly confronted him about this.
Oh,

380
00:24:03.580 --> 00:24:08.360
I didn't know that.
Yes.
Uh,
so I asked him about,
um,
well,
I,

381
00:24:08.370 --> 00:24:11.860
I sort of led into this,
but I asked him about panpsychism.
Oh.

382
00:24:12.040 --> 00:24:15.300
And so his answer was,
and like,
you know,

383
00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:20.770
I paraphrase a little bit,
but he,
he said,
um,
I almost believe it,

384
00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:24.790
except I want to change the word psyche too nifty.

385
00:24:25.210 --> 00:24:29.110
Like I believe in pen nifty ism.
Every atom is nifty.

386
00:24:29.620 --> 00:24:32.790
And so,
you know,
he's sort of demonstrating that,
uh,

387
00:24:32.860 --> 00:24:37.060
if we claim that everything in the universe has some quality,

388
00:24:37.061 --> 00:24:38.920
like everything is conscious,

389
00:24:39.370 --> 00:24:44.150
then there's no sort of descriptive power in that statement.
So that,

390
00:24:44.151 --> 00:24:46.300
that was his quote,
his kind of objection.

391
00:24:47.050 --> 00:24:49.940
<v 0>It's a perfectly reasonable thing to say.
But the thing is,</v>

392
00:24:49.941 --> 00:24:54.560
I do think that he exemplifies what I call the very large mistake.
Um,

393
00:24:54.680 --> 00:24:58.370
there's another sentence in which I quoted in my reply to him,

394
00:24:58.700 --> 00:25:02.660
which is he says,
um,
so first of all there's a argument,

395
00:25:02.661 --> 00:25:06.410
we'd say it,
I,
um,
you don't really see green,

396
00:25:06.411 --> 00:25:10.700
you just seem to see green and that he has made that move.

397
00:25:10.701 --> 00:25:14.030
And then someone says,
but what's seeming to see green?
Like,

398
00:25:14.390 --> 00:25:17.940
and the answer to that is it's just like seeing green.
So you,

399
00:25:18.220 --> 00:25:21.710
you can't escape by saying it's only a seeming.

400
00:25:21.890 --> 00:25:26.660
So he then,
this is like 25 years ago,
he then responded to that by saying,

401
00:25:26.930 --> 00:25:31.190
I quote,
if materialism is true,
there are no real seemings.

402
00:25:32.180 --> 00:25:36.260
So,
so he,
I mean I sound,

403
00:25:36.290 --> 00:25:38.480
I'm sure it was the light for what he said about nifty in us,

404
00:25:38.481 --> 00:25:41.360
but he has the problem that he thinks that if materialism is true,

405
00:25:41.510 --> 00:25:45.870
you cannot really have a qualia.
And,

406
00:25:46.280 --> 00:25:51.280
and that I say is the big mistake because physics simply is silent on the issue

407
00:25:53.031 --> 00:25:55.280
of the ultimate intrinsic nature of stuff.

408
00:25:56.540 --> 00:25:58.500
And I do,

409
00:25:58.820 --> 00:26:02.810
I am sympathetic to send psych is Criner kind of hoping to leave this,

410
00:26:03.230 --> 00:26:03.981
leave it out of this,

411
00:26:03.981 --> 00:26:08.981
but because I feel like it puts me at a sort of tactical disadvantage if I

412
00:26:08.991 --> 00:26:12.500
confess that I'm attracted to pans cycles because everyone thinks well that's

413
00:26:12.501 --> 00:26:17.260
just wacky or something.
Um,
but actually it's not new agey.
I think it's,

414
00:26:17.270 --> 00:26:21.560
it's actually where hard material of them need to.
But Hi,

415
00:26:21.561 --> 00:26:23.450
I'm slightly losing my track here.

416
00:26:23.451 --> 00:26:28.451
But the thing is that if you think that materialism rules out real seemings or

417
00:26:30.230 --> 00:26:34.130
um,
uh,
well,

418
00:26:34.131 --> 00:26:35.900
then you have to deny the existence of that.

419
00:26:35.901 --> 00:26:39.080
And I think what I'm saying we'd like to say to him is,

420
00:26:39.081 --> 00:26:40.340
you don't have to deny it.

421
00:26:40.520 --> 00:26:44.730
You've made a mistake about what physics says and what physics rules out.

422
00:26:45.940 --> 00:26:50.040
Right.
Is that clear enough?
It makes sense.
Yeah.
Okay.

423
00:26:50.710 --> 00:26:52.140
<v 4>All right.
Thank you very much.</v>

424
00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:56.730
I wanted to ask or talk a little bit about the relationship between

425
00:26:56.731 --> 00:26:59.760
consciousness and AI because I think that's a big debate.

426
00:26:59.761 --> 00:27:04.761
These issues and my understanding of a lot of people's perception of AI and just

427
00:27:06.631 --> 00:27:10.800
whether or not computers can be conscious is it's in part due to this belief

428
00:27:10.801 --> 00:27:13.740
that not only can math describe reality,

429
00:27:13.770 --> 00:27:17.220
it also has the ability to generate reality.
And in some sense,

430
00:27:17.221 --> 00:27:19.920
I don't know if I'm using this term correctly,

431
00:27:19.921 --> 00:27:23.250
but I think it's based on a notion of Cartesian dualism where there's this

432
00:27:23.251 --> 00:27:27.990
substrate of reality and then the mind is a mathematical abstraction on top of

433
00:27:27.991 --> 00:27:31.470
it or
no.
So I

434
00:27:33.510 --> 00:27:36.610
well may have flushed out the thought.
Um,

435
00:27:36.810 --> 00:27:41.810
so I suppose I'm just wondering if you think there is at least this a important

436
00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:46.290
distinction between one,

437
00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:50.340
whether or not the mind is a mathematical abstraction on top of reality.

438
00:27:50.370 --> 00:27:51.061
And in that case,

439
00:27:51.061 --> 00:27:54.660
math has the ability to generate first person reality versus whether or not the

440
00:27:54.661 --> 00:27:59.220
mind and consciousness are one in the same with the substrate of reality.

441
00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:00.690
And if you think that's,

442
00:28:02.140 --> 00:28:06.760
<v 0>I'm a bit lost.
Um,
I think I take it the maths in itself.</v>

443
00:28:07.180 --> 00:28:10.870
Math is wholly an abstract thing.
It hasn't,

444
00:28:10.890 --> 00:28:15.750
has no concrete,
um,
realities.
So,
but you know,

445
00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:20.200
a conscious state this,
this is,
it's not if you like,

446
00:28:20.201 --> 00:28:23.520
it's not in time.
So whereas your copy,

447
00:28:23.540 --> 00:28:26.800
your current conscious experience of green here is um,

448
00:28:28.210 --> 00:28:32.250
it's concrete and must be something more than merely mathematical.
So,

449
00:28:33.250 --> 00:28:36.420
<v 4>so I,
I guess I just want to draw that to the complete,</v>

450
00:28:36.770 --> 00:28:41.770
<v 0>I've heard this line of thought and I mean if anyone can develop it at all,</v>

451
00:28:42.351 --> 00:28:45.410
it would be helpful because,
um,
I don't,

452
00:28:45.550 --> 00:28:50.300
the thing I need a bridge because I didn't see that one can just say the mind is

453
00:28:50.301 --> 00:28:53.930
just mathematics because mathematics is abstract.
It's like,
think of,

454
00:28:54.140 --> 00:28:55.940
think of a book that just has,
you know,

455
00:28:56.150 --> 00:29:01.150
all the equations and Physics and it technically,

456
00:29:01.340 --> 00:29:02.660
theoretically speaking,

457
00:29:02.840 --> 00:29:07.190
that that's an abstract structure which could be realized by many different

458
00:29:07.191 --> 00:29:11.030
sorts of things.
Just as a,
you know,
a computer program could,

459
00:29:11.810 --> 00:29:16.810
could apply to the sort of tidal flow round some islands or to the Panamanian

460
00:29:17.571 --> 00:29:20.730
Maconomy.
It doesn't,
you see what I mean?
It needs to,
it,

461
00:29:20.820 --> 00:29:23.000
it's got to be concretized before.

462
00:29:23.420 --> 00:29:26.360
<v 4>So I,
I think I agree with you.
I just wanted to,</v>

463
00:29:26.900 --> 00:29:30.950
I think a lot of people believe AI can be conscious,
I think.
Well,

464
00:29:31.760 --> 00:29:35.330
<v 0>well what do you mean?
You mean a built thing?
Running a,</v>

465
00:29:35.900 --> 00:29:39.770
<v 4>so computers are fundamentally mathematical abstractions.</v>

466
00:29:40.410 --> 00:29:43.250
<v 0>Oh yeah.
This,
I'm sorry,
I'm sort of,</v>

467
00:29:43.290 --> 00:29:45.790
I probably unsympathetic to your language because I'm a sort of,

468
00:29:46.180 --> 00:29:48.320
I've been trained in philosophy.
I,
uh,

469
00:29:48.430 --> 00:29:52.280
it's an odd thing to say that they're concrete objects.
You can kick them there.

470
00:29:52.320 --> 00:29:55.920
They're not mathematical extractions.
They have programs.
Uh,

471
00:29:56.800 --> 00:30:00.730
and even those are fully,
you know,
there,
there's hardware.
Uh,

472
00:30:00.731 --> 00:30:03.280
so can you really express it in some way that I can,

473
00:30:03.910 --> 00:30:05.660
<v 4>sorry,
at least in,</v>

474
00:30:06.090 --> 00:30:09.570
I think the debate of consciousness takes many forms depending on the fields

475
00:30:09.571 --> 00:30:11.760
you're in.
And at least in the world of computer science,

476
00:30:11.761 --> 00:30:16.620
I think there's often a discussion on whether or not math as an entity

477
00:30:18.270 --> 00:30:21.790
can generate what we want,
what we call consciousness and yeah.

478
00:30:21.791 --> 00:30:25.140
But I'm very doubtful about truth of that statement,

479
00:30:25.380 --> 00:30:28.260
but I think a lot of people in the world of AI believe it.

480
00:30:28.320 --> 00:30:32.430
<v 0>Yeah.
Does that mean someone's got to flesh that out?
Because Matt,</v>

481
00:30:32.490 --> 00:30:35.010
you said you've taught it but talked about it as an entity.
Well,

482
00:30:35.011 --> 00:30:38.660
I say it's an abstract entity.
Um,
in the sense I've,

483
00:30:38.670 --> 00:30:42.810
all that mathematical truths existed before the universe existed,

484
00:30:42.811 --> 00:30:46.860
if it ever did not exist or would exist if there wasn't a universe.

485
00:30:47.170 --> 00:30:49.020
Um,
whereas consciousness,

486
00:30:49.021 --> 00:30:52.410
these are states of these are these alive occurrent,

487
00:30:52.710 --> 00:30:55.500
clockable concrete happenings.

488
00:30:55.650 --> 00:30:58.980
So math abstract things can't generate concrete things.

489
00:30:59.640 --> 00:31:03.990
You can build things that do things because they run programs that can be,

490
00:31:04.140 --> 00:31:07.540
that have abstract descriptions.
So,
you know,

491
00:31:07.710 --> 00:31:12.130
this is sort of philosophical quibbling,
but I think it's really important.
Um,

492
00:31:12.390 --> 00:31:14.700
anyway,
I'm glad to hear you're sympathetic.

493
00:31:18.250 --> 00:31:21.030
<v 4>I'm sure you've heard of the Mary's room argument.
Yes.</v>

494
00:31:21.760 --> 00:31:25.770
Nonphysical information.
And I was wondering as a materialist what

495
00:31:26.980 --> 00:31:31.040
<v 0>yeah,
I just wouldn't a paper about why I think it's been a big waste of time,</v>

496
00:31:31.041 --> 00:31:35.990
but it's been very convincing for me and I'm wondering for you,
okay,
what the,

497
00:31:36.120 --> 00:31:39.980
your uh,
oh,
which way were you convinced?
Convinced by the original argument,

498
00:31:40.630 --> 00:31:41.463
<v 4>Mary,</v>

499
00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:46.920
a good that Mary somehow is missing some information and something new by you

500
00:31:47.941 --> 00:31:49.360
can reiterate it.
The argument for that.

501
00:31:50.360 --> 00:31:54.020
<v 0>Yeah,
I will try to,
it's very simple.
Um,
actually</v>

502
00:31:55.670 --> 00:32:00.350
this is a thought experiment,
um,
published in 1982 by a guy called Frank Jackson,

503
00:32:00.351 --> 00:32:04.280
but actually I've done some research.
It's a very old idea.

504
00:32:04.760 --> 00:32:06.250
I quite actually,
uh,

505
00:32:06.320 --> 00:32:11.300
what the idea is that it's completely sort of fantastic and unrealistic and a

506
00:32:11.301 --> 00:32:12.890
typical philosophical way,

507
00:32:12.891 --> 00:32:17.840
Mary is this libs has lived all her life in a black and white room and she has

508
00:32:17.841 --> 00:32:21.920
no color experience.
She's nether,
she's got normal color vision,

509
00:32:21.921 --> 00:32:24.110
but she's never seen any,
she's never seen anything red.

510
00:32:24.111 --> 00:32:26.090
She's never seen anything other than black and white.

511
00:32:26.270 --> 00:32:27.950
But she's a super scientist.

512
00:32:28.280 --> 00:32:31.190
She has a complete grasp of physics and of neurophysiology.

513
00:32:31.580 --> 00:32:36.580
And she knows if she looked at your brain with a sort of super brain scanner and

514
00:32:36.621 --> 00:32:41.180
saw the stadium was in,
she'd be able to say he is seeing right now and,

515
00:32:41.270 --> 00:32:45.350
and,
but she's never experienced red herself.

516
00:32:45.350 --> 00:32:48.020
And then in the story she walked out of the room and wow,

517
00:32:48.350 --> 00:32:51.530
she says red for the first time and she learns something new.
That's,

518
00:32:51.680 --> 00:32:55.340
but there are a lot of people who've pushed back against that and saying,
no,

519
00:32:55.341 --> 00:32:56.780
she hasn't learned anything new.

520
00:32:57.500 --> 00:33:00.830
She knew everything there was to know when she knew the complete physics and

521
00:33:00.831 --> 00:33:03.710
neurophysiological story about what was going on in your brain.

522
00:33:04.570 --> 00:33:09.570
I hope that you all agree with me and him that she did learn something new,

523
00:33:09.951 --> 00:33:14.930
but did you want to develop that?
Is that sufficient description?
Okay,

524
00:33:15.770 --> 00:33:18.770
so do I just have,

525
00:33:19.340 --> 00:33:22.790
I cannot really defend the other side because I think it's so obvious that she

526
00:33:22.791 --> 00:33:26.050
learns something new and yeah,

527
00:33:26.900 --> 00:33:31.900
but you should know I took it to mean there that there exists nonphysical

528
00:33:32.001 --> 00:33:35.260
information and yeah.
Oh good.
Okay.
Now,

529
00:33:35.270 --> 00:33:40.270
so the issue here is that you think that's nonphysical and I say good.

530
00:33:40.340 --> 00:33:43.880
Yeah.
And I've been saying everything's physical.
Yeah,
no,
what I'm saying,

531
00:33:43.881 --> 00:33:44.870
it's not physics.

532
00:33:45.380 --> 00:33:49.190
This is the people who say that she doesn't learn anything new are precisely the

533
00:33:49.191 --> 00:33:54.191
people who think that it's part of their view that physics must give a full

534
00:33:55.581 --> 00:33:57.350
characterization of everything.

535
00:33:58.370 --> 00:34:03.100
And I think that is just obviously false.

536
00:34:03.101 --> 00:34:04.490
And I don't think you,
I don't,

537
00:34:04.820 --> 00:34:09.320
I'd like to bet you won't find many physicists to think that they get it.

538
00:34:09.440 --> 00:34:12.350
And it was a commonplace,
commonplace a hundred years ago that,
you know,

539
00:34:12.351 --> 00:34:17.351
physics gives this highly abstract characterization and leaves open the question

540
00:34:17.990 --> 00:34:22.760
of the stuff,
the stuff that concretely realizes the abstract structures.

541
00:34:23.330 --> 00:34:26.900
Um,
so,
so I would,

542
00:34:28.180 --> 00:34:32.360
okay,
it,
it,
it,
it turns on how you understand the word physical.

543
00:34:32.510 --> 00:34:35.780
You're right,
that it's quite a common understanding of the physical,

544
00:34:36.470 --> 00:34:40.400
the word physical that you'd say she gets some nonphysical information.

545
00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:45.290
But I want to say thinking of it like that is what is the very thing that puts

546
00:34:45.291 --> 00:34:49.400
up the barrier that makes it seem there's a terrible problem actually.

547
00:34:50.420 --> 00:34:51.690
Color experience is,
uh,

548
00:34:51.770 --> 00:34:55.640
is it self also a holy physical phenomenon,

549
00:34:56.030 --> 00:35:00.620
but it's not covered by physics.
So that would be my own,
I think we agree,

550
00:35:00.621 --> 00:35:02.540
but using different terminology.
Yeah,
no,
no,

551
00:35:02.541 --> 00:35:07.541
but it was helpful because you're quite right that people might want to say the,

552
00:35:09.110 --> 00:35:09.471
as it were,

553
00:35:09.471 --> 00:35:14.471
the information that you get just in looking at the green is if somehow a supra,

554
00:35:15.140 --> 00:35:18.950
physical or nonphysical,
but then as soon as you've said that you,
you're,

555
00:35:19.010 --> 00:35:22.580
you're locked into the old problem and you,
you're going to have to think,

556
00:35:23.190 --> 00:35:25.400
and if you're a tough physically is to going to have to think,
oh,

557
00:35:25.401 --> 00:35:29.540
that can't really exist.
And I'm trying to say,
no,
it's all right.

558
00:35:29.570 --> 00:35:31.970
You can fully believe in this.
This is also a physical,

559
00:35:31.971 --> 00:35:36.230
it's just not the kind of thing that physics talks about.
Uh,
and that's,

560
00:35:36.410 --> 00:35:39.150
it's not,
um,
uh,

561
00:35:39.300 --> 00:35:44.300
new agey or I'm not being hard nosed enough,

562
00:35:45.170 --> 00:35:46.520
uh,
to,

563
00:35:46.680 --> 00:35:51.680
to say that that's a physical because no one who gets what physics does thinks

564
00:35:53.251 --> 00:35:55.230
that physics ought to be able to describe that.

565
00:35:58.890 --> 00:36:03.590
<v 5>Hey,
so I'm a,
I've been thinking lately about,
um,</v>

566
00:36:03.860 --> 00:36:04.890
why,

567
00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:09.270
why computer scientists in general tend to resist this type of argument.

568
00:36:09.810 --> 00:36:14.160
And I think,
yes,
do the,
I don't know.
I,
I wonder,
um,
whether,

569
00:36:14.930 --> 00:36:19.770
um,
it has to do with the fact that the cook purely qualitative nature of color

570
00:36:19.771 --> 00:36:22.990
experience like this,
um,
is,
you know,

571
00:36:23.130 --> 00:36:27.030
completely independent of whatever like mathematical description of the three

572
00:36:27.031 --> 00:36:30.510
dimensional color space and it's pointed in that space.
Um,

573
00:36:30.540 --> 00:36:35.090
and we're very used to thinking that physics and computation are,

574
00:36:35.120 --> 00:36:39.480
you know,
equivalent in power and does computation is everything and this math is

575
00:36:39.481 --> 00:36:40.314
everything.

576
00:36:40.320 --> 00:36:43.020
It's this thing that we actually have to resist in the other direction with a

577
00:36:43.021 --> 00:36:47.550
lot of discussions with,
you know,
a non computer scientists.
Um,

578
00:36:47.580 --> 00:36:49.260
but just,
I don't know,

579
00:36:49.261 --> 00:36:54.261
I wonder if you've come up with a good way of getting people to recognize the

580
00:36:54.601 --> 00:36:58.740
fact that any given three dimensional space that describes human color

581
00:36:58.741 --> 00:37:02.400
experience and this particular color is pointed in that space is completely

582
00:37:02.401 --> 00:37:05.550
independent of the fact that that's the color experience I'm having right now.

583
00:37:05.960 --> 00:37:09.120
Like there's,
there's still this concrete,
purely qualitative,

584
00:37:09.150 --> 00:37:14.010
non describable only pointable at reality in that,
in that color experience.

585
00:37:14.960 --> 00:37:19.500
<v 0>Well,
um,
I'm not Joe,
you said three dimensional.</v>

586
00:37:19.510 --> 00:37:22.160
You meant as it were,
abstract state space,

587
00:37:22.730 --> 00:37:24.650
<v 5>RGB or HSV or,</v>

588
00:37:25.090 --> 00:37:27.610
<v 0>yeah,
but it could also be,
I mean,
if it's true,</v>

589
00:37:27.611 --> 00:37:32.050
that sound is just a matter of what does it Tambre pitch.

590
00:37:32.080 --> 00:37:36.220
What's the other thing?
It's also three dimensional I think so.

591
00:37:36.490 --> 00:37:39.160
I mean I think that would make the point that as it were,

592
00:37:39.161 --> 00:37:42.620
the Pune is structural description doesn't even tell you whether the quality

593
00:37:42.621 --> 00:37:45.250
space,
um,
okay,
this is,

594
00:37:45.330 --> 00:37:50.230
this is a node as it were in a state space and so his middle c played on an

595
00:37:50.231 --> 00:37:54.610
oboe.
Um,
and let's imagine that they're there by some men,

596
00:37:54.670 --> 00:37:56.500
some sort of calculation at the same space,

597
00:37:56.501 --> 00:38:01.120
but the abstract description hasn't given you the,
the,
the stuffy,
the stuff.

598
00:38:01.121 --> 00:38:03.910
He bit the qualities of character.
Um,

599
00:38:04.060 --> 00:38:08.860
and you need that as soon as you move from the abstract description to anything

600
00:38:09.100 --> 00:38:12.520
concrete at all.
So,
so the,
the,
as it were,

601
00:38:12.521 --> 00:38:15.610
I put in my challenge on my word right at the beginning of what you said,

602
00:38:15.611 --> 00:38:18.700
where you said some,
you said things like math is everything.

603
00:38:18.701 --> 00:38:20.110
Our competition is everything.
I mean,

604
00:38:20.960 --> 00:38:22.780
<v 5>and obviously don't believe that.
No,
I know.
Yeah.
No you</v>

605
00:38:22.780 --> 00:38:26.760
<v 0>don't.
I know you don't believe it,
but,
well,</v>

606
00:38:26.800 --> 00:38:30.580
I don't know if anyone else wants to defend this.
The,
Oh,
okay.

607
00:38:31.480 --> 00:38:35.630
This kind of position.
Oh,
someone's jumping up there.
Um,

608
00:38:36.620 --> 00:38:38.830
you gotta be Rick.
Uh,
okay.
Do you want to try it?

609
00:38:39.640 --> 00:38:42.460
<v 3>Sure.
Well,
I don't know if I'm qualified to defend anything.</v>

610
00:38:42.461 --> 00:38:46.840
I just had a like possibly clarifying questions.

611
00:38:46.841 --> 00:38:49.750
So when you say physical,

612
00:38:49.870 --> 00:38:52.990
I think a lot of people are talking about like reducible,

613
00:38:53.290 --> 00:38:58.270
so like is are these quality,
uh,
you're saying they are basic,

614
00:38:58.420 --> 00:39:02.260
they can't be decomposed into other things that we might be able to figure out

615
00:39:02.290 --> 00:39:04.480
or like is Qualia,

616
00:39:04.810 --> 00:39:07.720
is consciousness reducible to two?

617
00:39:07.721 --> 00:39:10.350
Like maybe some very basic things like

618
00:39:13.350 --> 00:39:18.280
you know,
like,
like that kind of thing and like,
um,

619
00:39:18.790 --> 00:39:22.360
and then I guess you can also like sort of use that perspective on Mary and the

620
00:39:22.361 --> 00:39:24.640
room where she,

621
00:39:24.641 --> 00:39:28.630
obviously her brain is in a different state where she learns the things about

622
00:39:28.930 --> 00:39:32.350
like all the equations of color that goes in one place and then the experience

623
00:39:32.410 --> 00:39:34.540
does change a different part of your brain.
Right?

624
00:39:34.541 --> 00:39:38.530
Like the memory of seeing green versus the memory of the equations are stored

625
00:39:38.531 --> 00:39:41.320
completely differently.
It's obviously a completely different thing,

626
00:39:41.710 --> 00:39:43.270
but like with the information,

627
00:39:43.271 --> 00:39:46.090
you can build a machine that will give him the state space.

628
00:39:46.091 --> 00:39:49.600
You can show it on the screen and then get that part of your brain of the

629
00:39:49.601 --> 00:39:53.860
experience.
Right.
I think,
uh,
are you telling me,

630
00:39:54.490 --> 00:39:57.000
I'm saying that,
um,
is this,

631
00:39:57.001 --> 00:40:01.240
the divide in the room might just be like a how your brain is organized thing,

632
00:40:01.270 --> 00:40:02.950
not a,
it's new information.

633
00:40:03.220 --> 00:40:08.220
There's a very easy way to transform the state space into experience is the like

634
00:40:08.330 --> 00:40:11.830
a projector,
you know,
or,
or uh,

635
00:40:12.010 --> 00:40:15.280
you can have a speaker that will play the oboe sound given the description and

636
00:40:15.281 --> 00:40:18.960
then you get the experience.
That's all fine.
Yeah.
So it's,

637
00:40:19.300 --> 00:40:22.000
I think to say it's new information.

638
00:40:22.001 --> 00:40:26.630
Is it stored in a different place in your brain?
Perhaps?
Well,

639
00:40:26.800 --> 00:40:28.930
but it's not like new information.
You can't,

640
00:40:28.960 --> 00:40:33.960
it's not something like that that you can move it there.

641
00:40:34.410 --> 00:40:35.730
<v 0>There's a kind of</v>

642
00:40:37.430 --> 00:40:41.620
associative load on the word inflammation,
which makes one think of it as,

643
00:40:41.621 --> 00:40:44.700
as it were somehow really computational or something.

644
00:40:44.701 --> 00:40:48.330
And I'm using it in a large sense.
In fact,
we don't even,

645
00:40:48.331 --> 00:40:51.150
we didn't even use the word information in the description of the case.

646
00:40:51.151 --> 00:40:55.560
We just said she learns something new,
something she did not know,

647
00:40:55.770 --> 00:40:58.460
which is what it is like to see red.
I'm going to,

648
00:40:58.650 --> 00:41:02.430
and I'm going to stick with that because it would you want to challenge that?

649
00:41:02.860 --> 00:41:05.680
<v 3>I would it depending on what you mean by learn something new.</v>

650
00:41:05.681 --> 00:41:07.840
I would agree that her brain does something it's never done before.

651
00:41:07.970 --> 00:41:10.080
<v 0>I hope you haven't been corrupted by philosophers.</v>

652
00:41:10.170 --> 00:41:12.790
<v 3>I've only read like some pop hop step.</v>

653
00:41:13.120 --> 00:41:15.880
<v 0>Um,
yeah.
Um,</v>

654
00:41:16.350 --> 00:41:21.240
I think she learns a new fact about reality,

655
00:41:21.270 --> 00:41:24.390
which is what it is like to see red,

656
00:41:24.420 --> 00:41:28.680
which he didn't know even though she had the super physics on the super

657
00:41:28.681 --> 00:41:33.350
neurophysiology.
Yeah.
It's just your daddy's irreducible.
Right.

658
00:41:33.530 --> 00:41:38.530
So I fully believe that having the right experiences simply neural goings on.

659
00:41:41.270 --> 00:41:44.390
But when I say that,
I don't mean anything.

660
00:41:44.391 --> 00:41:48.140
Like what most people say when they say it's neuro goings on because they,

661
00:41:48.530 --> 00:41:53.530
they think to say that is to be taste something reductive is to say it's nothing

662
00:41:53.601 --> 00:41:56.360
but,
or it's nothing over and above.

663
00:41:56.361 --> 00:42:00.590
But I'm saying neuro goings on are much more interesting than you thought

664
00:42:00.591 --> 00:42:05.300
because near this experience to you having a look at is neuro goings on.

665
00:42:05.301 --> 00:42:09.950
So wake up to the extraordinariness of matter,

666
00:42:10.760 --> 00:42:13.880
right?
That's what,
that's what the messages matter.

667
00:42:13.881 --> 00:42:18.260
This is matter does this one didn't know that.

668
00:42:18.260 --> 00:42:22.850
I mean the brain is 70 what,
77% water or something.

669
00:42:23.570 --> 00:42:26.990
It's 99% hydrogen,
oxygen,
nitrogen and carbon.

670
00:42:26.991 --> 00:42:31.991
I think these are things are more interesting than you for these elements that

671
00:42:33.650 --> 00:42:37.760
I think the reduction question is also a fascinating,
like how,
how does it,

672
00:42:37.820 --> 00:42:42.120
I don't think,
well that's the start of a question.

673
00:42:42.830 --> 00:42:43.760
Well,
it's true.

674
00:42:43.761 --> 00:42:48.761
That is another kind of deep root of the feeling that consciousness can't be

675
00:42:48.951 --> 00:42:52.190
physical.
So if we want to think that everything's physical,

676
00:42:52.191 --> 00:42:55.380
we're going to have to deny consciousness in the end.
Um,

677
00:42:56.480 --> 00:42:57.313
a lot of people,

678
00:42:57.350 --> 00:43:02.350
a lot of people think that this does lead to panpsychism is actually in

679
00:43:02.781 --> 00:43:05.440
escapable.
Um,
but you know,

680
00:43:06.230 --> 00:43:10.850
I like to say that that's because it has to be,
has to be part of the truth.

681
00:43:11.420 --> 00:43:11.661
Uh,

682
00:43:11.661 --> 00:43:16.661
so a lot of people think that the ultimate little bits,

683
00:43:17.241 --> 00:43:19.880
let's just say that leptons and corks,

684
00:43:19.881 --> 00:43:23.870
although I believe that leptons and quotes are just theoretical posits really,

685
00:43:23.871 --> 00:43:27.050
there aren't really things like that.
We think for sure.
Well,

686
00:43:27.051 --> 00:43:31.670
there can't be in any way conscious in consciousness involving,
so how did we,

687
00:43:32.300 --> 00:43:36.680
how could your vivid,
well,
the Google colors experience,

688
00:43:36.681 --> 00:43:41.300
how could that reduce the activity of Leptons and quotes?
No,
Adam is a cat,

689
00:43:41.301 --> 00:43:44.210
but you can still get a cat by putting a lot of them together.
Right?
Yeah,

690
00:43:44.211 --> 00:43:46.310
that's true.
Yeah,
that's true.
But you see,

691
00:43:46.730 --> 00:43:51.730
the idea is that that's kind of easy is just assembling the bits in a certain

692
00:43:52.431 --> 00:43:52.611
way.

693
00:43:52.611 --> 00:43:57.611
Whereas consciousness seems like a leap into a different quality to domain

694
00:43:57.651 --> 00:44:02.540
altogether.
I agree that it's,
it's,
it does feel different.
Yeah.

695
00:44:05.030 --> 00:44:06.530
No,
we know it isn't.

696
00:44:06.531 --> 00:44:10.160
But suppose I gave you the choice between two theories.

697
00:44:10.161 --> 00:44:14.720
One is that the ultimate little bits are totally and utterly had nothing.

698
00:44:14.750 --> 00:44:18.320
Nothing in any may consciousness like about them.

699
00:44:18.710 --> 00:44:21.100
And on the other view they do.
And we,

700
00:44:21.110 --> 00:44:25.400
if you are someone who thinks it's all in the brain as I do,
um,

701
00:44:25.700 --> 00:44:29.210
which theory do you prefer?
The theory whereby as it were,

702
00:44:29.211 --> 00:44:34.070
the technicolor of real experience arises from little totally nonconscious

703
00:44:34.080 --> 00:44:37.650
things in a certain arrangement or that it arises from things that already

704
00:44:37.740 --> 00:44:39.270
somehow conscience.
It's involving,

705
00:44:40.220 --> 00:44:41.630
<v 3>I think if you had,</v>

706
00:44:41.900 --> 00:44:45.080
if you have the part of the theory that explains how that happens,

707
00:44:45.140 --> 00:44:47.000
like if you can say what patterns,
Oh yeah.

708
00:44:47.001 --> 00:44:52.001
If I had the that then the part that has no extra basic quality,

709
00:44:52.011 --> 00:44:54.070
uh,
is a simpler theory.
Right.

710
00:44:54.140 --> 00:44:58.770
<v 0>It seems to,
okay.
That's a very common,
and I totally respect that view.
Yeah.</v>

711
00:44:59.520 --> 00:45:04.040
<v 3>Flyers that you would have to explain how right.
Like without explaining it.
Yeah.</v>

712
00:45:04.040 --> 00:45:04.460
Yeah.

713
00:45:04.460 --> 00:45:07.650
<v 0>And that is known as the explanatory gap and it's thought to be uncrossable.</v>

714
00:45:07.690 --> 00:45:12.490
I'm not mean it's uncomfortable then you're done.
But it may be okay.

715
00:45:12.530 --> 00:45:13.580
I want to say one thing there,

716
00:45:13.581 --> 00:45:17.840
which is just that nearly everybody thinks it's kind of wildly,

717
00:45:17.841 --> 00:45:22.460
theoretically extravagant to kind of s to lather consciousness all over the

718
00:45:22.461 --> 00:45:26.660
place.
They think that's,
but actually w one of the things you get,

719
00:45:26.690 --> 00:45:30.830
I hope when you really think about this is not actually it's a,

720
00:45:30.980 --> 00:45:34.850
it's a prejudice or an assumption to think that that's more extravagant than

721
00:45:34.851 --> 00:45:38.720
supposing that the ultimate staff is non consciousness involving,
um,

722
00:45:38.780 --> 00:45:40.850
they're just on a par.
Um,

723
00:45:41.090 --> 00:45:45.920
and then there's one more move that you can make with which probably alienating

724
00:45:45.921 --> 00:45:50.420
people here,
but really things that I,
I know these are new agey,

725
00:45:50.421 --> 00:45:53.270
but they're not,
I keep saying that.
Um,

726
00:45:54.680 --> 00:45:59.390
which now I've forgotten what it was.
So,
uh,
oh yeah.
Um,

727
00:46:00.620 --> 00:46:03.400
what was it?
Gone.
Okay.
Chloric

728
00:46:05.600 --> 00:46:07.240
yeah.
Um,

729
00:46:07.850 --> 00:46:11.630
I was wondering if he could just say a little bit more about this intrinsic

730
00:46:11.631 --> 00:46:14.750
characteristic of matter that Russel talked about.

731
00:46:15.530 --> 00:46:17.870
I think you've caught it staffing and a couple of times,
is it like,

732
00:46:17.871 --> 00:46:20.900
can we in principle figure out what it is?

733
00:46:20.901 --> 00:46:24.140
Is it like the of things that are unfalsifiable empirically?
Like,

734
00:46:24.141 --> 00:46:27.680
what are we talking about?
No,
I can't.
Um,
yeah,

735
00:46:27.681 --> 00:46:29.570
and some people would say if I know,
I think,

736
00:46:29.630 --> 00:46:32.420
I think we can't and I think it was a matter of principle physics,

737
00:46:32.450 --> 00:46:36.560
certainly physics or all sciences that require as it were,

738
00:46:37.340 --> 00:46:42.340
pub public accessibility of data and check ability and um,

739
00:46:42.530 --> 00:46:46.790
independent confirmation.
Um,
it,
it can't be done.

740
00:46:46.791 --> 00:46:49.670
The argument that it's there is,

741
00:46:49.730 --> 00:46:54.440
is simple and I've already given it to him one form,
which is just a,
so he's,

742
00:46:54.441 --> 00:46:57.150
suppose you've got the super final physics with its,

743
00:46:57.700 --> 00:47:02.580
with its beautiful equations and
uh,
and,

744
00:47:02.810 --> 00:47:06.830
and they're right
now you need some stuff.

745
00:47:06.860 --> 00:47:10.520
You need some stuff to be the thing,
the of which they are true.

746
00:47:10.700 --> 00:47:14.630
You've got to move from the abstract to the concrete.
Uh,

747
00:47:14.690 --> 00:47:19.690
and so the argument that there must be some intrinsic nature over and above as

748
00:47:20.901 --> 00:47:25.850
it were,
the physics descriptions of what charges or masses or,
um,

749
00:47:25.880 --> 00:47:30.120
it is simply that the world is real.
Um,

750
00:47:30.460 --> 00:47:34.480
it's not just mathematical structure.
So you could say it's like the real,

751
00:47:34.900 --> 00:47:39.130
like the realized rules of physics that have the additional property that they

752
00:47:39.131 --> 00:47:41.110
exist.
If you can call it existence,

753
00:47:41.111 --> 00:47:44.770
the first order predicate or is it oh hey.

754
00:47:44.800 --> 00:47:46.780
So it's like the anti shooting some philosophy

755
00:47:48.880 --> 00:47:53.730
like the intrinsic nature is the fact that it exists or it's,
oh,

756
00:47:53.980 --> 00:47:58.980
it's a little more than that because a lot of people think that numbers exist so

757
00:47:59.561 --> 00:48:03.230
that,
um,
it's,
it's just,
you know,

758
00:48:03.340 --> 00:48:06.880
concrete stuff that's um,
you cannot,

759
00:48:07.870 --> 00:48:12.070
the Churchill descriptions are true.
He Equals Mc squared,

760
00:48:12.100 --> 00:48:14.250
the inverse square law of gravitation there.

761
00:48:14.740 --> 00:48:19.240
There's something out there that makes them true and it's all cannot be just

762
00:48:19.241 --> 00:48:22.720
structure.
It must be something more and,
but it is in,

763
00:48:22.990 --> 00:48:26.350
it is not something that we could get at.

764
00:48:26.800 --> 00:48:30.010
And this is where people like Russell and Eddington say,
the thing I liked,

765
00:48:30.070 --> 00:48:35.070
the only clue we have as to the ultimate intrinsic nature of stuff is in having

766
00:48:35.651 --> 00:48:38.130
conscious experience.
Um,

767
00:48:38.710 --> 00:48:42.160
so adding to someone who says,
well,
in that case,

768
00:48:42.370 --> 00:48:46.450
why you just assumed that the rest of the stuff isn't in any way,

769
00:48:46.690 --> 00:48:49.660
anything to do with consciousness.
That's the,

770
00:48:49.661 --> 00:48:53.200
that is the theoretically extravagant move,
not the other way around.

771
00:48:53.201 --> 00:48:57.240
It's quite neat.
Okay.

772
00:48:58.570 --> 00:49:01.870
<v 6>Professor.
Um,
so I'm very sympathetic to your basic point,</v>

773
00:49:01.900 --> 00:49:05.620
which I understand as consciousness is undeniable.

774
00:49:05.621 --> 00:49:10.621
So if there's a problem with one of our physicalism or consciousness and support

775
00:49:11.741 --> 00:49:13.000
with our physical theory or consciousness,

776
00:49:13.001 --> 00:49:14.410
it's a problem with our physical theory.

777
00:49:14.850 --> 00:49:18.430
<v 0>Yeah.
Plus saying that there isn't a problem.
There's nothing in physics.
Right.</v>

778
00:49:18.970 --> 00:49:21.160
<v 6>What,
what I'm confused by is I guess how you use the,</v>

779
00:49:21.620 --> 00:49:25.010
the term where the identity physicalist cause it starts to sound a little bit

780
00:49:25.011 --> 00:49:26.890
like a catchall for everything.

781
00:49:27.060 --> 00:49:31.920
<v 0>I actually is absolutely right.
I mean that's a conscious,</v>

782
00:49:32.660 --> 00:49:35.880
that's a decision.
I mean you're quite right,
but what do I mean by physical?

783
00:49:35.881 --> 00:49:39.840
I just mean everything that's coming quickly in real and you might think I've

784
00:49:39.841 --> 00:49:42.510
tutored in some way or that's not helpful to my question.

785
00:49:43.020 --> 00:49:44.940
To put a point on it is,

786
00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:48.480
is there any sort of experience that you can imagine having that would cause you

787
00:49:48.481 --> 00:49:52.080
to change that identity and say Ohio was an idealist this whole time?

788
00:49:53.570 --> 00:49:58.140
Uh,
yeah.
I mean it's,
it's,
it's really,

789
00:49:58.890 --> 00:49:59.401
yeah.
I mean,

790
00:49:59.401 --> 00:50:02.940
maybe this isn't that this is perhaps what I'm in some of what I've been saying

791
00:50:02.941 --> 00:50:03.930
is more appropriate in a,

792
00:50:04.320 --> 00:50:09.300
in an audience of philosophers because that is exactly right that I wouldn't,

793
00:50:09.840 --> 00:50:11.280
well wait idealism,

794
00:50:11.640 --> 00:50:16.410
that's a tricky term because it's nothing like nothing to do.

795
00:50:16.411 --> 00:50:21.270
Some of you will have heard of Bishop Barclay who thinks that tables and chairs

796
00:50:21.271 --> 00:50:24.780
of just ideas in our minds and it's nothing to do with that.

797
00:50:25.530 --> 00:50:28.070
It's if you like,
even when it says no,

798
00:50:28.071 --> 00:50:30.200
the ultimate staff of which everything is made,

799
00:50:30.470 --> 00:50:33.590
which is just kind of on one view,
it's just sort of energy.

800
00:50:33.591 --> 00:50:36.260
It's just buzzing humming energy.

801
00:50:36.261 --> 00:50:40.180
It says the alternator of that stuff which we can't get at,
um,
um,

802
00:50:40.370 --> 00:50:44.480
is somehow already consciousness involving.
So,
uh,

803
00:50:44.510 --> 00:50:48.470
that if you want to extend the word idealism to cover that and I'm going to

804
00:50:48.530 --> 00:50:52.220
agree with you.
Yeah.
It's a kind of,
so it's a kind of,

805
00:50:52.760 --> 00:50:56.150
it's not a magical trick,
but it certainly playing with the words.

806
00:50:56.151 --> 00:50:56.984
I'm going to say

807
00:50:58.560 --> 00:51:03.260
the true physicalism is if you like a kind of idealism and I'm not the first who

808
00:51:03.261 --> 00:51:05.990
said that.
Um,
adding turn.

809
00:51:06.500 --> 00:51:09.260
These also have entertained it.
Um,

810
00:51:10.520 --> 00:51:13.310
I quoted shredding or in plank and um,

811
00:51:13.430 --> 00:51:17.390
the broiler and Lawrence and it's uh,
yeah,

812
00:51:17.720 --> 00:51:21.550
it's um,
so,
and I am not,

813
00:51:21.560 --> 00:51:24.830
but I think it's valuable to try and take the word physical,

814
00:51:25.190 --> 00:51:29.300
which has been sort of saying no,
you've got to think harder about it.

815
00:51:29.300 --> 00:51:31.380
It's not just what physics does cause it.

816
00:51:31.640 --> 00:51:35.720
Is it more about staying in conversation with the scientific community are sort

817
00:51:35.721 --> 00:51:40.280
of using the Commonweal?
I mean,
we know,
given my narrow little concerns,

818
00:51:40.281 --> 00:51:44.210
I'm more concerned with the philosophers and how they talk and I think they're

819
00:51:44.211 --> 00:51:47.930
the ones who've gone most wrong.
I've also got a quotation from my

820
00:51:49.820 --> 00:51:54.410
local Nobel laureate,
Steven Weinberg back in ut Austin where I come from.

821
00:51:54.411 --> 00:51:57.370
He says,
you know,
he said,
I don't know what my fellow physicist think,

822
00:51:57.371 --> 00:51:59.460
but I know that consciousness,
he was real,
you know,

823
00:51:59.780 --> 00:52:04.490
he is a very long way from thinking that being committed to physics and

824
00:52:04.491 --> 00:52:09.491
physicalism raises any ground for any kind of doubt about the reality of

825
00:52:10.251 --> 00:52:13.700
consciousness.
Hmm.
Yeah.

826
00:52:14.580 --> 00:52:18.690
Talking with us is your approach to materialism and consciousness.

827
00:52:18.740 --> 00:52:21.870
Anything about freewill and,
sorry,
what was the beginning?
That's right.

828
00:52:22.130 --> 00:52:25.710
Does your approach to materialism and consciousness imply anything about free?

829
00:52:25.710 --> 00:52:30.140
Well,
does it imply anything?
Uh,
I don't think so.
My view,

830
00:52:30.170 --> 00:52:30.951
I certainly,

831
00:52:30.951 --> 00:52:35.951
I think whatever views I have about freewill are completely independent of that

832
00:52:36.411 --> 00:52:36.921
position.

833
00:52:36.921 --> 00:52:41.480
So because I think they're a priority that in the sense that means you know,

834
00:52:41.500 --> 00:52:45.240
that they don't depend on empirical claims at all.
Uh,

835
00:52:45.980 --> 00:52:50.390
who do you want to develop that at all?
Maybe I'll just ask what,

836
00:52:50.630 --> 00:52:55.430
can you summarize your views do I do,
I have to,

837
00:52:55.431 --> 00:53:00.200
I want to take the fifth.
Um,
I'm listening.

838
00:53:00.230 --> 00:53:00.620
There's a,

839
00:53:00.620 --> 00:53:05.620
there's a very strong natural notion of what free will is given which I think

840
00:53:06.261 --> 00:53:07.850
it's not possible.
Um,

841
00:53:08.480 --> 00:53:13.480
but I don't think that's a problem for our ordinary everyday practices,

842
00:53:14.091 --> 00:53:16.610
which assume freewill and moral responsibility.

843
00:53:16.850 --> 00:53:21.770
I also think that although the argument that it's not,

844
00:53:21.800 --> 00:53:25.950
I could even give it to you if do you want it?
I'll give him really fast.
He goes,

845
00:53:26.340 --> 00:53:28.440
well,
we do what we do because of the way we are

846
00:53:30.950 --> 00:53:35.490
building all the complications of circumstance,
step two.
Um,

847
00:53:35.970 --> 00:53:38.190
so to be truly responsible for what we do,

848
00:53:38.191 --> 00:53:40.950
we've got to be responsible to be responsible for how we are.

849
00:53:42.270 --> 00:53:45.330
Because what we do flows from Amia.
But step three,

850
00:53:45.390 --> 00:53:49.710
you can't be ultimately responsible for how you are.
Why not?

851
00:53:49.740 --> 00:53:53.040
Because roughly you'd have to be the cause of yourself.

852
00:53:53.041 --> 00:53:56.460
You'd have to be there already to make yourself the way you are.

853
00:53:57.210 --> 00:53:59.850
But then you'd have been there already and you'd have to take another step.

854
00:54:00.480 --> 00:54:04.080
So you get what's called an infinite regress argument.
You could never,

855
00:54:04.081 --> 00:54:04.441
as it were,

856
00:54:04.441 --> 00:54:08.010
get back behind yourself in order to create yourself in order to be truly

857
00:54:08.011 --> 00:54:11.640
responsible for how you are and how you act.
And if you look at that argument,

858
00:54:11.641 --> 00:54:15.480
it is purely a priority.
It's got nothing to do with physics.

859
00:54:15.720 --> 00:54:19.080
It doesn't matter whether the determinism is true or determinism is false.

860
00:54:20.630 --> 00:54:25.560
Okay.
I would actually want to say one more thing about that,

861
00:54:25.561 --> 00:54:27.870
which is that although I think that the argument is,

862
00:54:27.871 --> 00:54:32.070
are unanswerable the argument against this very strong notion of free,
well,

863
00:54:32.820 --> 00:54:34.160
I also think that there are,

864
00:54:34.440 --> 00:54:39.420
we cannot help experiencing ourselves as radically free inaction.

865
00:54:39.480 --> 00:54:41.460
I think you can show why.
Okay.

866
00:54:42.850 --> 00:54:43.070
<v 2>Sorry.</v>

867
00:54:43.070 --> 00:54:46.460
Actually I have two questions or one of them was one of us asked earlier and I'm

868
00:54:46.490 --> 00:54:49.100
not sure it was fall I answered so I'll get back to that in a second.
But,

869
00:54:49.430 --> 00:54:52.370
so you mentioned that you think that consciousness,

870
00:54:52.670 --> 00:54:54.860
so it sounds like you're saying that maybe consciousness is an intrinsic

871
00:54:54.861 --> 00:54:56.360
property that even,
you know,

872
00:54:56.361 --> 00:54:59.630
like it goes down to the level of the quarks or whatever and I'm a little

873
00:54:59.631 --> 00:55:03.490
confused as to what that means.
And you said for example that uh,

874
00:55:03.500 --> 00:55:06.200
it would be really strange.
I'm not sure strangers strange the word you use,

875
00:55:06.201 --> 00:55:06.650
but that,

876
00:55:06.650 --> 00:55:11.030
that if we were conscious but we are made up of things that aren't conscious,

877
00:55:11.270 --> 00:55:13.640
but like a television,
you know,

878
00:55:13.850 --> 00:55:17.000
takes a signal and broadcast and image to people's eyes.

879
00:55:17.001 --> 00:55:19.190
It's made up of things that individually do not do that

880
00:55:19.450 --> 00:55:21.730
<v 0>good.
Yup.
Yeah.
This is,</v>

881
00:55:21.731 --> 00:55:25.660
this is the whole issue of emergence where emergent properties,

882
00:55:25.661 --> 00:55:30.550
which are broadly defined as they're not there at one level and then they are,

883
00:55:30.551 --> 00:55:32.240
they're at another level.
And this,
the,
the,

884
00:55:32.680 --> 00:55:34.540
the favorite example of that is liquidity.

885
00:55:34.541 --> 00:55:36.880
So an individual water molecule isn't liquid,

886
00:55:36.881 --> 00:55:41.020
but when you put a lump them together,
um,
you've got liquid,
you've got liquidity,

887
00:55:41.380 --> 00:55:44.320
there are a lot,
obviously lots of such properties.
Uh,

888
00:55:44.321 --> 00:55:46.750
what people do is as it were,

889
00:55:46.751 --> 00:55:51.751
that's kosher emergence that summer that's emergence that we can make sense of

890
00:55:52.031 --> 00:55:54.910
and understand.
Uh,
the idea is,

891
00:55:55.510 --> 00:55:58.550
and this is a key issue here,
you're quite right.
Um,

892
00:55:58.630 --> 00:55:59.890
but let me just insert one thing,

893
00:55:59.891 --> 00:56:03.760
which is that the main things I've been wanting to say about how being a

894
00:56:03.761 --> 00:56:08.050
materialist doesn't mean you have to be doubtful about consciousness.

895
00:56:08.260 --> 00:56:12.640
That's independent of the psych psyches bit that wants to put consciousness

896
00:56:12.641 --> 00:56:16.810
right down at the bottom of things.
Okay.
So that was just an insertion.

897
00:56:17.830 --> 00:56:21.490
But going back to the issue of emergence,
uh,
your quite right,

898
00:56:21.491 --> 00:56:25.420
you get properties emerging.
When you put small,
as it were,

899
00:56:25.421 --> 00:56:27.280
crudely small bits together,

900
00:56:27.760 --> 00:56:30.010
you get bigger things would have completely different properties.

901
00:56:30.330 --> 00:56:33.880
Th Th th the I the intuition is the idea is that

902
00:56:35.800 --> 00:56:38.110
cases like liquidity and not problematic,

903
00:56:38.111 --> 00:56:43.090
but the idea that consciousness could emerge from the radically and artfully and

904
00:56:43.091 --> 00:56:46.750
holy nonconscious is problematic.
It's,
it's as it were,

905
00:56:46.751 --> 00:56:51.751
a leap into a different domain in a way in which the other cases aren't.

906
00:56:53.650 --> 00:56:58.200
Why is that?
Why is that know the answers in one and not the other.
Yeah.

907
00:56:58.240 --> 00:57:02.470
And the truth is that when it's not really possible to pursue dizzy fi,

908
00:57:02.740 --> 00:57:06.840
the notion of radical emergent.
So it's a very good question,
uh,
in,
in the,

909
00:57:06.880 --> 00:57:10.620
there is no in a knockdown argument for it.
Um,

910
00:57:11.770 --> 00:57:13.300
so you're quite right.
And I mean,

911
00:57:13.301 --> 00:57:17.530
I've had this objection recently that someone saying they use the example of

912
00:57:17.531 --> 00:57:21.910
heat saying,
you know,
you've got these individual bits and they don't have it.

913
00:57:21.911 --> 00:57:25.840
And then you put the new speed them all up and you've got heat.
And why is it,

914
00:57:25.841 --> 00:57:30.841
why is the alleged emergence of consciousness from the utterly nonconscious

915
00:57:31.810 --> 00:57:36.790
worse or different?
And I,
at that point,
it's a kind of standoff and I say,

916
00:57:37.570 --> 00:57:40.630
I see it,
it's very intuitive.
Let me see if I can,

917
00:57:42.370 --> 00:57:46.450
I might be able to get a one slide here.
I don't know how much time we have left.

918
00:57:47.170 --> 00:57:49.780
I'm sorry about this.

919
00:57:51.250 --> 00:57:55.480
I'm hoping it'll come.
Yeah.
So William James,

920
00:57:57.220 --> 00:58:01.320
um,
this is from his prints.

921
00:58:01.550 --> 00:58:04.340
So continuity,
it doesn't,
uh,

922
00:58:05.170 --> 00:58:08.680
the demand for continuity has over large tracts of science proved itself to

923
00:58:08.681 --> 00:58:10.300
possess true prophetic par.

924
00:58:10.480 --> 00:58:14.200
We ought therefore ourselves sincerely to try every possible mode of conceiving

925
00:58:14.201 --> 00:58:18.130
the dawn of consciousness so that it may not appear or equivalent to the

926
00:58:18.160 --> 00:58:20.620
eruption,
into the universe of a new nature,

927
00:58:20.980 --> 00:58:24.380
nonexistent until them mainly to call the consciousness.

928
00:58:24.390 --> 00:58:26.110
NASA will not serve our turn.

929
00:58:26.111 --> 00:58:28.780
It's true that the word signifies not yet quite born.

930
00:58:29.260 --> 00:58:32.890
And so it seems to form a sort of bridge between the existence and non entity.

931
00:58:32.891 --> 00:58:37.000
But this is a verbal quivell.
The fact is that this continuity comes in.

932
00:58:37.001 --> 00:58:40.480
If a new nature comes in at all,
the quantity of the latter is quite a material,

933
00:58:40.720 --> 00:58:42.100
then he makes a quite a nice joke.

934
00:58:42.550 --> 00:58:47.200
The girl in Midshipman easy could not excuse the illegitimacy of her child by

935
00:58:47.201 --> 00:58:50.410
saying it was a very small one.
And consciousness,

936
00:58:50.411 --> 00:58:54.640
however small is an illegitimate birth in any philosophy that starts without it.

937
00:58:54.641 --> 00:58:59.380
And yet professors to explain all facts by continuous evolution.
So that's the,

938
00:58:59.410 --> 00:59:01.570
that's the intuition and not an argument.

939
00:59:01.780 --> 00:59:01.910
<v 2>Right.</v>

940
00:59:01.910 --> 00:59:06.100
And I've tried to follow our entirely the argument that because consciousness,

941
00:59:06.760 --> 00:59:09.150
if consciousness is not a characteristic of small things,

942
00:59:09.160 --> 00:59:12.880
that for it to emerge is impossible because there would be discontinuous or,

943
00:59:13.050 --> 00:59:16.550
<v 0>yeah,
it's just the same.
It's just,
no,
it's just,</v>

944
00:59:16.890 --> 00:59:19.710
it's an eloquent expression of the intuition.

945
00:59:19.711 --> 00:59:22.940
And I use that word as a kind of saying it's not an argument,

946
00:59:23.090 --> 00:59:24.670
but it's very compelling.

947
00:59:24.720 --> 00:59:27.530
It knows that nowhere in the whole of sciences we have it.

948
00:59:27.531 --> 00:59:32.531
Do we have to postulate radical con this continuity's and it does look like any

949
00:59:33.051 --> 00:59:37.640
passage from the ethylene unconscious to something conscious is a radical leap.

950
00:59:38.090 --> 00:59:38.630
Um,

951
00:59:38.630 --> 00:59:43.630
so there's a strong theoretical reason to doubt it.

952
00:59:46.580 --> 00:59:49.110
There's not,
it's not a knockdown argument.
Uh,

953
00:59:49.111 --> 00:59:51.260
and that's just a nice expression of it,
I think.

954
00:59:51.470 --> 00:59:54.410
<v 2>Yeah.
I mean the other,
this guy,
but I'm just real quick before I,</v>

955
00:59:54.500 --> 00:59:57.560
I do someone asked earlier basically if a computer program can be conscious and

956
00:59:57.561 --> 01:00:00.470
I think,
I think you got into a discussion about mathematics at some point.

957
01:00:00.471 --> 01:00:02.960
It'd be cool if you could return to the question of whether a program could

958
01:00:02.961 --> 01:00:04.140
experience quality,
right?

959
01:00:04.440 --> 01:00:06.050
<v 0>Nope.
Uh,
program.
Um,</v>

960
01:00:08.840 --> 01:00:11.600
what shall I do?
Shall I say something?
Try and say something about that.

961
01:00:11.740 --> 01:00:16.060
<v 4>You can come back to it later.
Okay.
Is there another question?
Wait,</v>

962
01:00:16.061 --> 01:00:20.050
can I try to add to the point that this point about sort of,
uh,

963
01:00:20.500 --> 01:00:24.910
the,
um,
I don't know how to describe this point actually,

964
01:00:24.911 --> 01:00:29.020
but you can,
you know,
you can experiment with human brains.

965
01:00:29.021 --> 01:00:32.830
You can like sever human brains,
right?
Like the split brain problem in,

966
01:00:32.880 --> 01:00:34.420
in which case,
you know,

967
01:00:35.080 --> 01:00:40.080
what seems to appear is like to independently functioning consciousnesses or,

968
01:00:41.380 --> 01:00:42.490
or,
right.

969
01:00:42.491 --> 01:00:45.850
And I think that's an important point that if you can sort of physically divide

970
01:00:45.851 --> 01:00:50.080
an object and it's still like has conscious properties,

971
01:00:50.590 --> 01:00:54.640
uh,
and,
and,
uh,
I mean,
I dunno,
this is subtle.
Like it,

972
01:00:54.880 --> 01:00:58.930
it both appears to be a single being and appears to be two separate beings

973
01:00:58.931 --> 01:01:02.960
because,
uh,
you can do psychological experiments showing that,

974
01:01:02.970 --> 01:01:06.820
that there is no information passing between the two halves of the brain,

975
01:01:06.821 --> 01:01:09.070
but they're making inferences,
uh,

976
01:01:09.140 --> 01:01:12.820
in such a way that it kind of appears to function like a single person.

977
01:01:13.060 --> 01:01:17.380
That I think sort of by that route you have to conclude that,

978
01:01:18.010 --> 01:01:21.430
that,
you know,
consciousness arises from small things.

979
01:01:21.431 --> 01:01:26.230
So coming into a bigger,
a conscious entity.

980
01:01:26.380 --> 01:01:29.980
<v 0>Yeah.
I mean I think we might all agree about that,
but yeah,</v>

981
01:01:30.020 --> 01:01:32.140
ponder the issue here is whether,

982
01:01:32.170 --> 01:01:35.710
what do we think the small things are like and uh,

983
01:01:36.070 --> 01:01:39.020
part of what I'm doing.
Do you want to,
um,

984
01:01:41.140 --> 01:01:44.350
part of what I've been saying is simply that,

985
01:01:45.850 --> 01:01:48.970
well,
yeah.
So what the argument was,

986
01:01:49.120 --> 01:01:53.020
the issue I was just discussing was whether there was a difference between

987
01:01:53.021 --> 01:01:56.680
thinking that the small things with themselves utterly nonconscious and thinking

988
01:01:56.681 --> 01:02:00.340
that they were already somehow in consciousness involving,

989
01:02:00.490 --> 01:02:05.490
and I was saying there's no reason to favor the standard view that they have no

990
01:02:06.071 --> 01:02:10.920
sort of consciousness because it creates this huge theoretical problem.
Uh,
but I,

991
01:02:10.921 --> 01:02:15.530
I just agree with everything you've said and it seems to support the right,

992
01:02:16.190 --> 01:02:20.160
the general view that consciousness can be heavily physical.
Yeah.
Um,

993
01:02:23.040 --> 01:02:26.430
<v 7>okay.
Um,</v>

994
01:02:27.480 --> 01:02:32.160
so I,
I kind of just want you to,
uh,
articulate,

995
01:02:32.520 --> 01:02:35.550
um,
well there's two defenses of consciousness.

996
01:02:35.551 --> 01:02:38.280
I feel like I've noticed in this talk,

997
01:02:38.610 --> 01:02:43.610
I want you to articulate the first one and then to maybe address like a possible

998
01:02:44.701 --> 01:02:48.930
counter argument to the second.
The first is,
uh,
seems to be that,

999
01:02:49.350 --> 01:02:53.130
um,
science,
any,

1000
01:02:53.390 --> 01:02:56.820
anything we know about the world is his first perceived.

1001
01:02:56.821 --> 01:02:58.680
And then like everything else we know about it,

1002
01:02:58.740 --> 01:03:02.940
even the fact that there's physics,
that things are physical,
that there's,
uh,

1003
01:03:02.970 --> 01:03:06.750
you know,
uh,
everything else comes from,
uh,
things that we've,

1004
01:03:06.840 --> 01:03:09.380
patterns we've inferred from,
uh,

1005
01:03:09.480 --> 01:03:14.160
data that we originally perceived from,
uh,
being conscious.
That's true.

1006
01:03:14.161 --> 01:03:16.890
But I didn't think she used that.
Yeah.
Okay.
Um,

1007
01:03:16.980 --> 01:03:19.980
I mean that feels very defensive when it seems like you,
uh,

1008
01:03:20.370 --> 01:03:25.090
you accept that as a good reason to take it as like a axiom.
Yeah.

1009
01:03:25.250 --> 01:03:29.520
Uh,
philosophy.
Um,
and the second one seems unrelated,

1010
01:03:29.600 --> 01:03:31.140
it entirely,
but the,

1011
01:03:31.150 --> 01:03:35.670
it's the fact of that you're a disability of consciousness on which this

1012
01:03:35.671 --> 01:03:36.504
addresses too.

1013
01:03:36.930 --> 01:03:41.930
And I wonder if you could explain that as kind of a definitional problem.

1014
01:03:43.170 --> 01:03:46.260
Consciousness is,
as we understand it,

1015
01:03:46.261 --> 01:03:50.100
just like the full feed of perceptual,
um,

1016
01:03:50.370 --> 01:03:53.250
information being received at any given moment.

1017
01:03:53.340 --> 01:03:58.340
And that is by definition almost like not reduceable.

1018
01:03:58.691 --> 01:03:59.090
We,

1019
01:03:59.090 --> 01:04:04.090
we would be perfectly happy to accept like the definition of a bottle of gas as

1020
01:04:05.580 --> 01:04:09.690
the average velocity of all the atoms in it.
You know,
we wouldn't be like,
oh,

1021
01:04:09.691 --> 01:04:14.010
you're not really describing that accurately because you haven't described every

1022
01:04:14.011 --> 01:04:17.700
atom and it's philosophy and its components of atomic protocols.

1023
01:04:18.030 --> 01:04:19.910
But we would never accept,
uh,

1024
01:04:20.340 --> 01:04:25.080
a similar abstract description of our own consciousness because it is the full

1025
01:04:25.081 --> 01:04:27.030
feed.
Yeah.

1026
01:04:27.210 --> 01:04:30.940
<v 0>I actually wasn't,
I wasn't thinking of that particular issue.</v>

1027
01:04:31.600 --> 01:04:36.600
The desert where not even the sort of the divine omniscience description of the

1028
01:04:37.211 --> 01:04:41.960
little bits would,
where does it,
where some the constitute a description of the,

1029
01:04:43.330 --> 01:04:47.950
the experiential field.
Um,
I wasn't actually thinking of that point.
Um,

1030
01:04:48.910 --> 01:04:53.380
I'm not sure.
I think that might be true of lots of cases of immersions,

1031
01:04:53.440 --> 01:04:58.110
including ones that as I like to say Kosho ones so that the,

1032
01:04:58.111 --> 01:05:02.080
the don't create a problem.
So I'm uh,

1033
01:05:02.470 --> 01:05:03.370
I'm not sure that,
I,

1034
01:05:03.510 --> 01:05:06.110
<v 7>sorry,
what was the,
what was the term you just,</v>

1035
01:05:06.390 --> 01:05:09.390
<v 0>uh,
I just like getting,
it's not,</v>

1036
01:05:09.530 --> 01:05:14.530
I just mean ordinary standard emergence that's not puzzling in any way.

1037
01:05:15.571 --> 01:05:16.860
Like when you get liquidity,

1038
01:05:16.861 --> 01:05:20.590
when you put lots of individual water molecules together,
data,

1039
01:05:20.591 --> 01:05:25.240
they're not liquid individually,
but they,
liquidity now emerges as we say.

1040
01:05:25.770 --> 01:05:30.230
Um,
so I wasn't actually thinking of what you said.
The,
the,

1041
01:05:30.330 --> 01:05:33.110
the point that as it were,
the,

1042
01:05:33.190 --> 01:05:38.190
the perfect description of full on total experiential field human experience

1043
01:05:40.510 --> 01:05:45.510
could never be extracted from the super description of all the little bits.

1044
01:05:45.680 --> 01:05:49.870
Um,
I would think,
I don't see that as,

1045
01:05:49.871 --> 01:05:52.460
as the main problem.
In fact,
no.
Um,

1046
01:05:52.790 --> 01:05:56.720
I don't know what more to say except that I don't really feel that I'm defending

1047
01:05:56.990 --> 01:05:58.240
consciousness.
I'm just trying,

1048
01:05:58.460 --> 01:06:03.460
what I'm really trying to do is saying people who are very impressed by the

1049
01:06:03.921 --> 01:06:07.700
powers of say computers or,
um,

1050
01:06:07.970 --> 01:06:10.610
or by the brilliant successes of physics,

1051
01:06:10.850 --> 01:06:15.850
many of them have been led to think that there's a problem about being as good

1052
01:06:17.301 --> 01:06:21.620
old fashioned realist about consciousness.
I'm just saying to say,
no,
there isn't,

1053
01:06:22.310 --> 01:06:26.960
there's no problem.
It's a mistake to think that,
um,

1054
01:06:27.920 --> 01:06:28.753
that these,

1055
01:06:28.800 --> 01:06:33.800
that computational science or physics or anything raises any doubt about the

1056
01:06:34.761 --> 01:06:36.230
reality of consciousness,

1057
01:06:38.310 --> 01:06:42.950
verifiable or is it just axiomatic,
the existence of consciousness?

1058
01:06:43.220 --> 01:06:46.740
Well here,
I like to,
I like to,
uh,

1059
01:06:47.630 --> 01:06:51.470
a friend of mine called Ned blocker who was at Nyu that some of you may know

1060
01:06:51.471 --> 01:06:53.150
this,
he quotes,

1061
01:06:53.690 --> 01:06:57.470
he quotes Louie Armstrong at this point when Louie Armstrong has asked what jazz

1062
01:06:57.471 --> 01:07:00.260
was.
And he said,
if you got to ask,
you ain't ever going to know.

1063
01:07:01.010 --> 01:07:04.250
And that's exactly what I would say to someone who seems to question the

1064
01:07:04.251 --> 01:07:07.940
existence of consciousness.
If you've got to ask you it never going to know.
Um,

1065
01:07:08.850 --> 01:07:11.720
uh,
there's another,
and I would just say to each of us,

1066
01:07:11.750 --> 01:07:16.700
you know what it's like from your own country,
from your own case.
It May,
well,

1067
01:07:16.760 --> 01:07:21.290
it may possibly be that when you get someone in this audience looks at this

1068
01:07:21.291 --> 01:07:26.120
thing,
which we all agree is green,
that the,
if I could look through their eyes,

1069
01:07:26.121 --> 01:07:29.870
I might see what I would call red.
It doesn't matter.
Um,
you know,

1070
01:07:29.871 --> 01:07:32.540
what consciousness is from your own role in case I would say.

1071
01:07:33.050 --> 01:07:36.110
And if someone persisted and they were close enough to me,

1072
01:07:36.120 --> 01:07:40.600
I might give them a kick and say that there's an example for you.
Uh,

1073
01:07:40.730 --> 01:07:42.080
it's just so basic.

1074
01:07:42.081 --> 01:07:47.081
It upsets me that philosophers have seriously question the existence of this

1075
01:07:47.511 --> 01:07:49.730
thing.
Um,
and that,
and if so,

1076
01:07:49.731 --> 01:07:52.370
what I'm trying to saying is there's no good reason to do so.

1077
01:07:53.080 --> 01:07:53.913
<v 1>MMM.</v>

1078
01:07:59.550 --> 01:08:03.560
<v 0>All right.
Thanks again everyone for coming and thank the speaker.</v>

1079
01:08:03.760 --> 01:08:04.120
<v 1>Okay.</v>
