00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:07.930
Please welcome Steve Chant to Google.

2
00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:11.223
<v 0>Okay.</v>

3
00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:13.000
<v 1>Thank you very much for us.</v>

4
00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.630
So I'm going to be talking today about some work that was done with the European

5
00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:21.710
Space Agency.
A,
I want to emphasize,
I,
this was all collaborative work.
Uh,
uh,

6
00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:25.850
with Isa,
uh,
at the top of my team is at the top of this.

7
00:00:25.851 --> 00:00:29.810
Here is where my team,
including myself,
Greg gravity or Danny Tran,

8
00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.620
Martinia tuition,
Josh Double Day.
Uh,

9
00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:37.630
the rest of those lines are actually all a ISA collaborators of mine.

10
00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:43.040
I'm the operations engineers.
Federico Nespoli,
Miguel Perez,
I car mark Costa.

11
00:00:43.041 --> 00:00:47.930
See Day,
uh,
as well as liaison scientists.
Claire have a lot.
Bernard Geiger,

12
00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:52.970
um,
uh,
Nico Altobelli and the software team,
Manuel Fernandez,
friend Valeho,

13
00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:55.890
a Rafi Andrews and Michael Coppers.
Uh,

14
00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:59.360
so I have to emphasize very strongly this has been a collaborative effort.

15
00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:03.020
So I'm going to start off by talking a little bit about comments and why we're

16
00:01:03.021 --> 00:01:05.180
interested in comments and why we want to go there.

17
00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.800
So I'm going to start with a video here in this video is actually very good

18
00:01:09.801 --> 00:01:11.120
cause it's technically accurate.

19
00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:14.770
<v 0>It's quite unusual was set to spacecraft</v>

20
00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:21.450
landing distance comments 60 71 thing here to remember is that,

21
00:01:24.731 --> 00:01:27.790
compare the pictures of the comment here during this VR video,

22
00:01:27.791 --> 00:01:30.250
which is before we got there,
the web,
we actually couldn't,

23
00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:34.300
<v 2>comments are really important.</v>

24
00:01:34.301 --> 00:01:39.301
They're like a time capsule back to our past were formed just as the planets

25
00:01:39.971 --> 00:01:41.830
performed in solar system formation.

26
00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:44.700
<v 0>This is actually accurate with the planetary,</v>

27
00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:47.280
just the formation of the solar system.

28
00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:57.353
<v 2>Did that,</v>

29
00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:01.420
is that the original material that the solar system kind of went from something

30
00:02:01.421 --> 00:02:06.000
like that to water and oceans and palm trees and the light?

31
00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.600
How do we know what our original solar system was made out of?

32
00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.680
Does the comment really represent some of that original material?

33
00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:19.210
And it's so very different.
How do we get from there to where we are now?

34
00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:55.120
<v 1>So actually,
uh,
there were a few things that were probably in their video.</v>

35
00:02:55.121 --> 00:02:57.790
They were a little too fast going by.
But uh,

36
00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:02.590
early on before the solar system really existed between four and four and a half

37
00:03:02.591 --> 00:03:07.360
billion years ago,
there was just a ball of gas,
gas,
dust,
ice.
And so on.

38
00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:12.280
And because of conservation of angular momentum,
it begins to form into a disc.

39
00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:15.250
And that disc,
the elements in that disc are,

40
00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:19.030
are what are called plan and testimonials in common testimonials.
And so they,

41
00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:22.840
as they come,
come together and they collide and they hit,
they stick together.
Uh,

42
00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:25.990
and so generally,
very slowly,
everything forms in.

43
00:03:25.991 --> 00:03:28.480
Eventually it becomes the planets that we know.

44
00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:31.510
And the problem is if we look at on earth,

45
00:03:31.511 --> 00:03:35.650
the different materials we have there too distorted the,

46
00:03:35.651 --> 00:03:39.760
there two evolved in mature from a,
from a,
uh,

47
00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:41.980
a solar system formation standpoint.

48
00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:45.160
So what happens is when we look at the things on earth,

49
00:03:45.161 --> 00:03:47.680
they've been affected by water.
They've been affected by the sun.

50
00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:51.190
So they're not like the solar system was four and a half billion years ago.

51
00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:55.840
Comments are actually the enable us to look back into what the solar system,

52
00:03:55.841 --> 00:03:58.090
this was like over 4 billion years ago.

53
00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:01.600
And the way we do that is we have to go and find these comments in.

54
00:04:01.601 --> 00:04:05.500
The comments exist in two main areas,
the Kuyper belt and the Oort cloud.

55
00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:10.630
So the Kuyper belt you might know about because,
uh,
Pluto is no longer a planet.

56
00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:13.480
It's just one of many,
many Kuyper belt objects.

57
00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:18.430
So that's the primary near source of comments.
And then the Oort cloud,

58
00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:22.210
I didn't know this before I started working on Rosetta is much further out.

59
00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:26.080
It's so far out,
it's about one quarter of the way to the nearest star.

60
00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:29.290
So it's really what some people might consider interstellar space.

61
00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:33.570
And ideally what we'd like to do is we'd like to go out into the Oort cloud and

62
00:04:33.571 --> 00:04:36.760
take one of those objects and study it.
But shockingly,

63
00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:39.490
going a quarter of the way to the nearest star is kind of hard.

64
00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:43.330
So that would take a long time and a lot more money.
Uh,

65
00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:45.940
let's suppose the next best thing you want to do,

66
00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:49.660
you want to find one of those objects that's coming into the inner solar system.

67
00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:53.870
Uh,
so those of you who remember,
remember your physics would know that,
uh,

68
00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:55.540
if you have something that's in,

69
00:04:55.541 --> 00:04:59.500
as eccentric of an orbit is that its angular momentum is going to be conserved.

70
00:04:59.501 --> 00:05:03.640
What does that mean when it comes in?
It's going to be going really,
really fast.

71
00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:07.840
Okay.
The other problem is it's period might be hundreds of thousands of years,

72
00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:12.190
so you need to find this dark object,
which is one light year away.

73
00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:16.270
You need to predict that it's going to come in and you need to predict this by

74
00:05:16.271 --> 00:05:19.660
the way,
about 15 years in advance because that's how long it takes to build the

75
00:05:19.661 --> 00:05:24.070
spacecraft and plan the trajectory to meet it.
So kind of hard things to do.
Okay,

76
00:05:24.071 --> 00:05:26.500
so now,
now the,
what's the next thing we're going to try and do?

77
00:05:26.501 --> 00:05:29.140
I'm going to try and get a Kuyper belt object.
Well,

78
00:05:29.141 --> 00:05:32.770
it turns out that there's what are called Jupiter main belt comments.

79
00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:36.790
These are comments that were in the Kuyper belt and there were perturbed at some

80
00:05:36.791 --> 00:05:40.060
various point in time and so there's sort of in the orbit of Jupiter that's kind

81
00:05:40.061 --> 00:05:43.720
of good,
but Jupiter is kind of hard to get to.
Also write

82
00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:49.080
[inaudible],
which is the target that we had for,

83
00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:54.120
for Rosetta is actually a main belt comment and the extremely impressive nab nab

84
00:05:55.151 --> 00:05:59.960
people figured out that about in the 18 hundreds about 1850.

85
00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:02.750
It was perturbed from a 10 year orbit to a six year orbit.

86
00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:08.260
And then from that time period it was perturbed again in 1952 an even shallower

87
00:06:08.721 --> 00:06:13.370
orbit.
And since that time it's been coming into the earth.
Okay.
And so,

88
00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:14.060
well,

89
00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:17.240
coming in near the earth coming into the earth would be a very bad thing for all

90
00:06:17.241 --> 00:06:18.360
of us.
Uh,

91
00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:23.400
so we have this comment that's only 50 60 years been coming in and having all of

92
00:06:25.431 --> 00:06:29.640
these volatiles burnt off of it.
So this is a great target for us to,
uh,

93
00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:33.940
rest to get to visit.
So,
uh,

94
00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:38.150
well originally,
originally it was,
so the question was what was the path before?

95
00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:41.000
So it's originally as a main belt comment.

96
00:06:41.001 --> 00:06:45.020
Then it was perturbed to have a roughly one decade or a bit that still did not

97
00:06:45.021 --> 00:06:46.340
take it close enough to the sun.

98
00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:49.520
And then it was perturbed into this six year orbit.

99
00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:53.870
And I think I actually messed up the dates around 1950 uh,

100
00:06:53.871 --> 00:06:58.040
and then since then it's actually been in this six year orbit and since it's

101
00:06:58.041 --> 00:06:59.480
period is 6.6 years,

102
00:06:59.481 --> 00:07:02.360
you can do the math and figure out how many times it's had the volatiles

103
00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:06.050
disturbed.
Does that answer your question?
Okay,
great.

104
00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:10.880
Still it's quite hard to get to this comment and why?

105
00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:13.270
Because when it's in this highly eccentric orbit,

106
00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:17.780
it's going really fast relative to the earth.
So we actually launched,

107
00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:22.430
Rosetta actually launched in 2004 and we had Mars earth,

108
00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:24.500
earth,
earth.
Okay.

109
00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:28.580
So we've been flying over a decade to try and catch this comment and you said,

110
00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:33.500
wait,
you told me the comment only has a period of 6.6 years.
Yes,
that's right.

111
00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:36.110
We've been flying so long to match with this comment.

112
00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:40.520
We missed it the first time around and we're catching it the second time around.

113
00:07:40.730 --> 00:07:43.010
And this is actually entirely accurate here.

114
00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:48.100
We chased it to actually chase it from behind to arrive at the comment,

115
00:07:48.590 --> 00:07:53.060
uh,
way far out there.
That outer line is in fact Jupiter.
So now you can look at,

116
00:07:53.061 --> 00:07:56.270
you know,
Jupiter versus in Earth orbit.
Uh,

117
00:07:56.271 --> 00:08:00.050
and then we followed it to a pair of Helion,
which was August,

118
00:08:00.050 --> 00:08:04.670
2015 and so this is really a fantastic chance to visit this comment because we

119
00:08:04.671 --> 00:08:08.990
chased it,
we caught up with it and an orbit.
And August,

120
00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:12.820
2014 we sought to the closest approach and then an additional year we saw it

121
00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:17.750
cooled down and become less active.
So just to put this in a little bit of scale,

122
00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:22.430
in 2004 when Rosetta launched,
this was your cell phone.

123
00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:24.350
Does anybody here have a flip phone still?

124
00:08:25.230 --> 00:08:26.063
<v 3>Okay.</v>

125
00:08:28.050 --> 00:08:30.270
<v 1>The top pop artists was Brittany Spears.</v>

126
00:08:31.050 --> 00:08:33.510
And this last one went over quite well at Harvard.

127
00:08:34.350 --> 00:08:39.150
Some undergraduate started a company in his dorm room called the Facebook that,

128
00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:40.410
and we'll just leave it at that.

129
00:08:41.950 --> 00:08:42.783
<v 3>Okay.</v>

130
00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:43.840
<v 1>So where is that?</v>

131
00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:47.340
ETA is really one of the most challenging space missions ever conducted.

132
00:08:47.341 --> 00:08:51.510
So 6 billion kilometer crews for over 10 years.

133
00:08:51.511 --> 00:08:52.980
As we talked about.
And you know,

134
00:08:52.981 --> 00:08:56.970
all of the four gravity assists a two and a half year hibernation.

135
00:08:57.180 --> 00:08:59.070
So originally they had a different target.

136
00:08:59.071 --> 00:09:02.220
They actually had a launch vehicle problem and they had to adjust to this
target.

137
00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:04.470
So for two and a half years,

138
00:09:04.471 --> 00:09:09.471
the spacecraft actually was existing just on heaters in batteries and a timer in

139
00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:14.910
the,
in thermal points to wake it up,
went out to 5.2.

140
00:09:14.911 --> 00:09:18.270
We Aau in Aau is of course the distance of earth to the sun.

141
00:09:18.271 --> 00:09:22.500
So about 93 million miles.
I'm an American,
so I'm not so good at the metric.

142
00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:23.340
Uh,

143
00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:28.140
correction rendezvous with a four kilometer object traveling at 135,000

144
00:09:28.141 --> 00:09:32.100
kilometers per hour.
And then this slide is actually a little out of date.

145
00:09:32.130 --> 00:09:34.770
So normally we only went about 10 kilometers,

146
00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:38.940
but since last week I can say we went to zero kilometers since the orbiter

147
00:09:38.941 --> 00:09:40.910
actually landed on the comet.
Uh,

148
00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:45.940
but before that we flew fly bys of about two kilometers orbiting a changing

149
00:09:46.591 --> 00:09:47.430
common environment.

150
00:09:47.431 --> 00:09:51.090
And I'll tell a little bit of a story about how the spacecraft safe one time

151
00:09:51.091 --> 00:09:54.540
when we flew to closely,
uh,
and unknown landing environment.

152
00:09:54.541 --> 00:09:57.600
We'll talk more about that later in orbiting a low gravity body.

153
00:09:57.870 --> 00:10:00.090
Just to give you an idea of the scale of there's Ed admission,

154
00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:03.330
26 instruments on both the Landon Landon orbiter,
uh,

155
00:10:03.470 --> 00:10:05.670
over 2000 people worked on the project.

156
00:10:06.090 --> 00:10:09.690
And of course the only thing that we can really relate to is the total costs

157
00:10:09.691 --> 00:10:12.060
about 1.7 billion US dollars.

158
00:10:12.470 --> 00:10:17.170
That figure obviously changes with exchange rates.
Um,

159
00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:21.000
so NASA was quite thrilled to be part of this east submission.

160
00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.970
I have to always emphasize it's an east submission.
Uh,

161
00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:28.680
and specifically Rosetta is really the truest sense of space exploration.

162
00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:31.440
And I'll talk a little bit about some of the things that we learned about

163
00:10:31.441 --> 00:10:34.920
comments that if you'd pulled all the commentary scientists before,

164
00:10:34.921 --> 00:10:37.260
they would have all been a hundred degree,

165
00:10:37.310 --> 00:10:39.210
180 degrees in the opposite direction before.

166
00:10:40.410 --> 00:10:45.410
So recall the earlier I sh in the video I showed you this round,

167
00:10:46.590 --> 00:10:48.330
mostly your spiritual object.

168
00:10:48.750 --> 00:10:53.670
The actual comment turned out to be a contact binary so we can see it here.

169
00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:59.520
Uh,
that,
uh,
information was actually scooped inadvertently.
Um,

170
00:10:59.970 --> 00:11:02.970
and basically the terminology,

171
00:11:02.971 --> 00:11:06.480
there's two sets of terminology for the geography on Cherry,
I'm aggressive.

172
00:11:06.580 --> 00:11:10.950
Manco,
there's the Egyptian,
a Rosetta theme.
And then there's of course,
this is,

173
00:11:10.951 --> 00:11:15.090
everybody sees this and says this is a rubber duck.
And so there's the head,

174
00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:19.770
the body,
the neck,
the head lobe in the body,
Loeb.

175
00:11:19.770 --> 00:11:22.830
And people will often refer to that even in the science team meetings,

176
00:11:22.831 --> 00:11:24.390
even in papers and stuff like that.

177
00:11:24.810 --> 00:11:29.010
And particularly when you're talking about the landing,
um,
if you're curious,

178
00:11:29.011 --> 00:11:32.190
there's actually publicly available three d models,

179
00:11:32.191 --> 00:11:36.000
the highest resolution models,
not publicly available,
90 million facets.

180
00:11:36.001 --> 00:11:40.350
It's based on a Cyrus data,
but like the Mathias model is publicly available.

181
00:11:40.351 --> 00:11:43.920
And if you're curious,
you can print it yourself.
So you,

182
00:11:44.070 --> 00:11:46.410
so what happened is that there's two pieces,

183
00:11:46.411 --> 00:11:48.630
common testimonials as they're called and they came together.

184
00:11:48.631 --> 00:11:51.300
It's just the right velocity and they stuck.
Um,

185
00:11:51.330 --> 00:11:55.780
originally when we first got near the comment,
uh,
people thought that,
well,
no,

186
00:11:55.781 --> 00:12:00.490
maybe the,
the,
that stuff in the neck is more volatiles and in a bladed off,

187
00:12:00.491 --> 00:12:04.450
as we came closer to the sun,
as we kept coming closer to the sun.
But now,

188
00:12:04.451 --> 00:12:07.180
based on the analysis and composition,
uh,

189
00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:10.810
they believe that it's in fact a contact binary early on.

190
00:12:10.810 --> 00:12:12.640
One of the scientists believe that in fact,

191
00:12:12.641 --> 00:12:16.420
there were five different pieces that came together based on a texture theory.

192
00:12:16.870 --> 00:12:17.703
Uh,
but you know,

193
00:12:17.710 --> 00:12:22.510
there are many different opinions and that's the beauty of science.
Um,

194
00:12:22.990 --> 00:12:27.640
uh,
this gives you some insight into just how textured the comet is.

195
00:12:27.641 --> 00:12:30.100
So there's all these features who's boulders and so on.

196
00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:34.330
And now MSL has made this quite common.
But,
uh,
at this point in time,

197
00:12:34.331 --> 00:12:36.020
the Achieva selfie off of the file,

198
00:12:36.021 --> 00:12:41.021
a candor filey lender at camera was actually quite unusual.

199
00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:44.420
They only realize they could actually in fact do this,
um,

200
00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:48.700
as they were checking out the finally lander.
And then,
believe it or not,

201
00:12:48.701 --> 00:12:53.380
it's remarkably large remarks are remarkably hard to actually get the comment in

202
00:12:53.381 --> 00:12:57.220
the background.
I'm very bad at selfies,
so I empathize with the OPS team.

203
00:12:58.330 --> 00:13:01.090
So in November,
2014,
we delivered the lander.

204
00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:06.580
This is actually from the o Cyrus camera showing the lander dropping away and

205
00:13:06.581 --> 00:13:11.260
remember now,
see how stationary the lander is,
right?
It's not tumbling.

206
00:13:11.380 --> 00:13:14.830
That's because it has fly wheels on it to keep it from tumbling.
Okay.

207
00:13:16.060 --> 00:13:19.720
Well what happened when we actually deployed the lender?
Well,
as the,

208
00:13:19.780 --> 00:13:24.730
as the lander mission manager likes to say,
we landed not once but three times.

209
00:13:25.210 --> 00:13:29.260
Okay.
So if you look at this imagery,
uh,
it's quite fascinating.

210
00:13:29.261 --> 00:13:33.550
You can see this is actually an image sequence that was designed to actually

211
00:13:33.610 --> 00:13:38.200
search for the lender.
And so they bracketed the estimated landing time.

212
00:13:38.530 --> 00:13:43.210
And you can actually see here,
uh,
I'm gonna just put it over here a little bit.

213
00:13:43.450 --> 00:13:45.460
These images are about five minutes apart.

214
00:13:45.730 --> 00:13:49.630
This one's really interesting because you have the touchpoint touchdown point

215
00:13:49.631 --> 00:13:54.631
before and after in those slight pockmarks or the actual footprints of the

216
00:13:54.731 --> 00:13:59.500
lender.
And here's the one where it's like,
if you saw this in real time,
ah,
stop.

217
00:13:59.830 --> 00:14:04.000
It's hopped in.
It's going away.
Okay.

218
00:14:04.420 --> 00:14:07.870
And just so you don't think that the second part of my talk is all made up,

219
00:14:08.170 --> 00:14:10.120
this is the actual plan,
uh,

220
00:14:10.220 --> 00:14:14.050
that came off of my laptop and that's actually showing those,
oh,

221
00:14:14.051 --> 00:14:18.280
Cyrus imaging sequences in that plan as they were planned.
Okay.

222
00:14:19.450 --> 00:14:22.690
So what actually happened in the file?
A landing.
Uh,

223
00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:27.040
what happened is the lander hit and it turns out that the,

224
00:14:27.041 --> 00:14:30.670
the comment was several orders of magnitude harder than they expected.

225
00:14:31.030 --> 00:14:34.810
So there are several mechanisms that are designed to allow the finally land.

226
00:14:34.811 --> 00:14:37.780
You're just secure itself to the,
to the nucleus.
First of all,

227
00:14:37.781 --> 00:14:42.190
it has legs that flex,
okay?
So that should absorb some of the energy.

228
00:14:42.670 --> 00:14:45.400
Second of all,
there's screws,
three screws,

229
00:14:45.430 --> 00:14:50.290
one in each of the feet at the end of the legs that at contact they try and

230
00:14:50.291 --> 00:14:51.124
screw in.

231
00:14:51.380 --> 00:14:56.380
But the primary securing mechanism is there are two harpoons in the body of the

232
00:14:56.481 --> 00:14:59.090
lander that when the contact is detected,

233
00:14:59.091 --> 00:15:02.960
they fire and those are supposed to secure the lender.
Unfortunately,

234
00:15:02.990 --> 00:15:05.600
what happened is the screws did not secure it.

235
00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:09.020
The harpoons did not fire.
Uh,

236
00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:12.500
and so the filing lander bounced.

237
00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:17.930
And to make things worse,
the flight software on the file,
a lander said,
okay,

238
00:15:17.931 --> 00:15:21.770
I have these flywheels,
they're eating up power,
I've now landed,

239
00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:26.450
I'm going to turn them off to save energy.
And that's entirely planned.
Okay?

240
00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:29.900
So now what happens is the finally landers tumbling,
right,

241
00:15:30.290 --> 00:15:33.780
because of course it didn't hit perfectly flat,
uh,

242
00:15:33.830 --> 00:15:36.680
and it actually tumbles for over an hour.

243
00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:41.630
And so the problem here is you're landing on the head.

244
00:15:41.810 --> 00:15:44.120
The original intended landing site is about here.

245
00:15:44.870 --> 00:15:49.870
And I forgot to mention because it is rotating and it's rotating it between 12

246
00:15:50.181 --> 00:15:53.030
hours.
I think at this time it was about 12 hours and 40 minutes.

247
00:15:53.270 --> 00:15:58.270
But the rotational period of the common is varied from 1220 to 1250 as it comes

248
00:15:58.521 --> 00:16:01.940
into the sun.
It changes actually.
And so it,

249
00:16:02.180 --> 00:16:04.100
it basically bounced for over an hour.

250
00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:07.730
So think of this as you're trying to land in mountain view.

251
00:16:08.180 --> 00:16:13.180
You hit and you balance and you end up landing somewhere around Las Vegas.

252
00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:19.820
Okay.
I actually probably further one 12th of the circumference,
right?

253
00:16:20.750 --> 00:16:25.220
Then we got very lucky.
The next bounce we hit a very soft spot.

254
00:16:25.370 --> 00:16:28.550
So after that it's only about seven minutes.
Okay.

255
00:16:28.850 --> 00:16:33.050
And then eventually we landed and then now we'll talk about where we actually

256
00:16:33.051 --> 00:16:36.860
landed.
So first an eye test quick.
Oh yeah,
go ahead

257
00:16:41.710 --> 00:16:45.200
at,
okay.
So the question is the second bounce,
did we land on our feet?

258
00:16:45.230 --> 00:16:48.050
Because we know we landed on our feet for the first bounce because that's what

259
00:16:48.051 --> 00:16:50.320
everything was designed for.
Uh,

260
00:16:50.510 --> 00:16:55.090
it is believed that roughly we landed on our feet because otherwise there would

261
00:16:55.091 --> 00:16:59.360
have been a lot of damage to the lender.
But we don't actually know.

262
00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:01.070
We have very little information.

263
00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:03.830
Since you didn't know the shape of the common ahead of time,

264
00:17:04.010 --> 00:17:06.200
how was the lending spot determined?

265
00:17:06.201 --> 00:17:09.830
Did you get it just back and then pick it out yourself?
Very good question.
Yeah,

266
00:17:09.831 --> 00:17:14.720
so we did not know the shape of the comment before we arrived.
I'll only,

267
00:17:14.721 --> 00:17:19.460
all that we had was very,
very grainy,
a foot photogrammetry,

268
00:17:19.461 --> 00:17:21.530
which is like basically LBO information.

269
00:17:21.531 --> 00:17:24.890
So when you see these repeated lightenings and dark innings,
uh,

270
00:17:24.891 --> 00:17:28.250
you can infer something about the shape and that's mainly from huddle.

271
00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:32.060
But when we exited hibernation in January,
2014,

272
00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:36.380
we actually entered a very close orbit to the comment in August,

273
00:17:36.380 --> 00:17:40.720
2014 and we did not deploy the lander until November,
2014.
Uh,

274
00:17:40.730 --> 00:17:45.730
so we were frantically mapping the comment primarily with,

275
00:17:45.810 --> 00:17:50.200
uh,
with Cyrus and virtus,
the two of the main imaging instruments.
Um,

276
00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:51.660
in order to choose a landing spot,

277
00:17:51.661 --> 00:17:54.750
there were 10 landing spots that were proposed.

278
00:17:54.900 --> 00:17:58.530
And then there was a long and heated discussion about exactly where to land

279
00:17:58.531 --> 00:18:00.270
because the scientists say,
wow,

280
00:18:00.271 --> 00:18:05.250
like the neck looks really interesting to me because it's got weathered terrain

281
00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:10.020
in the engineers say,
what are you insane?
That's like the worst place to land.

282
00:18:10.140 --> 00:18:11.790
If you're off by a little bit,
you know,

283
00:18:11.791 --> 00:18:15.180
you're floating in there and the comic goes like that and kind of like smashes

284
00:18:15.181 --> 00:18:16.200
you.
Um,

285
00:18:16.830 --> 00:18:20.490
and then the scientists also would like to be in particular areas of

286
00:18:20.491 --> 00:18:23.700
illumination and non illumination and there's a particular sweet spot,

287
00:18:23.970 --> 00:18:26.580
not too hot,
you know,
kind of like the goldilocks thing,

288
00:18:26.581 --> 00:18:28.380
not too hot but not too cold.
Right?

289
00:18:28.381 --> 00:18:31.680
You want enough sun to power yourself but not too much sun that you,

290
00:18:31.710 --> 00:18:35.190
you bake the lender.
So there was a long,

291
00:18:35.250 --> 00:18:40.250
well long is four weeks a very well thought out process to choose the landing

292
00:18:40.591 --> 00:18:43.050
site.
And then of course we ended up landing somewhere else.

293
00:18:43.250 --> 00:18:45.860
Whatever relative velocities are we talking about putting the lender in the,

294
00:18:45.861 --> 00:18:47.910
in the,
and the comment?
Very good question.

295
00:18:47.940 --> 00:18:51.600
So actually the relative fly by velocities that we have on a Rosetta are

296
00:18:51.601 --> 00:18:53.970
extremely low for a space mission.

297
00:18:54.270 --> 00:18:58.740
So when we actually fly by the comment space,
the,
so we generally,

298
00:18:58.741 --> 00:19:01.110
if that's the sun,
and this is a comment,
uh,

299
00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:05.160
the spacecraft flies on the sun word side and there are a few reasons for that.

300
00:19:05.430 --> 00:19:08.520
One is there are two tails that the common has.
When does the debris tail,

301
00:19:08.550 --> 00:19:10.380
which is in the Anti Delta v Direction.

302
00:19:10.380 --> 00:19:14.130
And then there's the [inaudible] which faces away from the Sun,
right?

303
00:19:14.370 --> 00:19:18.340
That's actually what people see,
right?
They see the ion tail.
Um,

304
00:19:18.660 --> 00:19:20.670
you want to stay away from the eye on tail because you know,

305
00:19:20.671 --> 00:19:24.250
all these charged particles hitting your spacecraft is kind of not cool.
Uh,

306
00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:28.470
you also want to stay on the bright side of the spacecraft because all these

307
00:19:28.471 --> 00:19:32.190
imaging devices over here,
they're not really seeing much,
right?

308
00:19:32.220 --> 00:19:35.880
So they're not going to want to be over there.
So we fly,
we actually,

309
00:19:35.881 --> 00:19:39.540
the gravity is so low that we sort of like fly like a skateboarder or used to

310
00:19:39.541 --> 00:19:41.820
fly like a skateboarder.
I keep getting the tense wrong.

311
00:19:42.120 --> 00:19:47.120
So we would fly these line segments like this with the camera is pointed at the

312
00:19:48.391 --> 00:19:52.350
comment.
Okay.
Now then the lander itself,
uh,

313
00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:57.380
the intended velocity is actually one to a fraction of a meter per second.

314
00:19:57.840 --> 00:20:02.820
And then actually when the spacecraft landed,
when the orbiter landed,
uh,
again,

315
00:20:02.821 --> 00:20:06.210
we're talking trying to get it around less than a meter per second.

316
00:20:07.350 --> 00:20:10.860
So you're talking like a walking pace,
which is very,

317
00:20:10.861 --> 00:20:12.720
very unusual for space flight.
Yes.

318
00:20:13.020 --> 00:20:16.650
So during the time after the bounce,

319
00:20:17.700 --> 00:20:21.630
was there any attitude control from the control system or was it just kind of

320
00:20:21.631 --> 00:20:25.260
idling?
Just waiting for it?
There is no attitude control system on the lender.

321
00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:29.400
So that's why you need to fly wheels.
Yeah.
Okay.

322
00:20:29.580 --> 00:20:33.870
So now you guys,
uh,
here's the punchline on this slide.

323
00:20:34.380 --> 00:20:37.830
So the test is who can find the lander and by the way,

324
00:20:37.831 --> 00:20:41.730
think tens of thousands of these images and then poor people on the o Cyrus
team.

325
00:20:41.731 --> 00:20:45.420
Like Cecile Yanno,
we're actually pouring over these for more than a year.

326
00:20:46.610 --> 00:20:51.130
Um,
it's kind of,
this was the best,
uh,

327
00:20:51.550 --> 00:20:52.720
this was the best one I had.

328
00:20:52.721 --> 00:20:55.180
It actually would have been better if I cheated and given you one without the

329
00:20:55.181 --> 00:20:57.560
lander in it.
I,

330
00:20:58.060 --> 00:21:00.390
<v 4>Yep.
One more shuttles,</v>

331
00:21:05.900 --> 00:21:10.430
<v 1>oddly enough,
I have one that actually calls it out.
Right.</v>

332
00:21:10.460 --> 00:21:13.550
So then you can see it.
Here's the body of the lander.

333
00:21:13.930 --> 00:21:17.840
Here are the legs and it's sideways in a crevasse.
Exactly.

334
00:21:17.841 --> 00:21:20.390
As predicted predicted,

335
00:21:20.840 --> 00:21:24.650
I say predicted because they use the telemetry data from the solar panels to

336
00:21:24.651 --> 00:21:28.610
know the orientation of the lander.
Right.
They know the approximate region.

337
00:21:28.611 --> 00:21:32.870
They know they can infer the orientation,
uh,
for some earth orbiting cubes.

338
00:21:32.871 --> 00:21:35.450
Hats like the Ipex cube sat that I was a Pi for.

339
00:21:35.451 --> 00:21:39.580
You actually build a tumble model from the periodic current data from the,

340
00:21:39.630 --> 00:21:40.730
the solar panels.

341
00:21:41.250 --> 00:21:45.270
<v 5>So you mentioned the comment itself is about four kilometers in</v>

342
00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:49.860
diameter.
Who Right.
Some equivalent of that.

343
00:21:49.890 --> 00:21:54.690
And then the orbiter was orbiting at a distance by 10.
Yeah.

344
00:21:55.570 --> 00:21:58.690
<v 1>During the highest activity,
we'd have to be closer to 30 kilometers,</v>

345
00:21:58.691 --> 00:22:03.250
30 to 50 kilometers.
Okay.
Um,
during the end of mission,

346
00:22:03.490 --> 00:22:06.790
some of the fly buys,
in fact,
that's why they were able to find the lander.
Okay.

347
00:22:06.840 --> 00:22:08.680
Uh,
some of the flybys were several kilometers.

348
00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:10.380
<v 5>Okay.
So like,
like I said,
my question is,</v>

349
00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:15.750
does the gravitational influence off the comedy extend that far behind?
It's,

350
00:22:15.790 --> 00:22:17.390
it's everywhere where,

351
00:22:17.430 --> 00:22:19.550
<v 1>right.
It's just GMM over r squared.
Right.</v>

352
00:22:19.551 --> 00:22:22.100
It's just a question of how much and the,

353
00:22:22.460 --> 00:22:26.330
so basically as a comment is more active,
the atmospheric gas,

354
00:22:26.420 --> 00:22:29.690
the coma pushing you away from it is much more than the gravity,

355
00:22:30.020 --> 00:22:33.140
so you're really not orbiting it.
That's why we were flying those line segments.

356
00:22:33.380 --> 00:22:37.430
Okay.
Uh,
so this is actually,
you know,
the end of mission was,
uh,
last week.
Uh,

357
00:22:37.460 --> 00:22:42.020
that's the last oh,
Cyrus image.
It's blurry.
Why is it blurry?

358
00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:44.840
Because it's only taken at a distance of 20 meters.

359
00:22:44.841 --> 00:22:47.270
Nobody designed the camera to take an image of that close.

360
00:22:47.300 --> 00:22:50.840
It's actually designed for more like a kilometer or more.
Uh,

361
00:22:50.841 --> 00:22:54.440
there's the Alice last spectrum.
That's one of the,
uh,
uh,
uh,

362
00:22:54.610 --> 00:22:58.280
US instruments from Alan Stern.
It's wiry.
And then at the right,

363
00:22:58.310 --> 00:23:01.940
it's actually showing the loss of signal from the spacecraft.

364
00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:05.360
So we have no hope that the spacecraft is going to come back.

365
00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:09.200
Why did they choose to fly it into the comment?
Uh,
there's two reasons.

366
00:23:09.500 --> 00:23:12.920
One is it's going to die anyway and you can't leave it next to the comment,

367
00:23:13.190 --> 00:23:16.100
right?
Because if you,
well,

368
00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:18.560
it's not going to end up by the time it comes around again,

369
00:23:18.561 --> 00:23:21.280
it's not going to be next to the comment.
There's just no way.
Uh,

370
00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:24.590
the other thing is that enabled them to capture all kinds of unique data,

371
00:23:24.620 --> 00:23:27.460
particularly for the in situ instruments.
Uh,

372
00:23:27.530 --> 00:23:30.650
by going in that close a lot of the heavier species of molecules,

373
00:23:30.710 --> 00:23:32.660
they don't actually get to sample them further out.

374
00:23:33.820 --> 00:23:37.940
Did it serve the orbit?
Uh,
no,
because,

375
00:23:38.390 --> 00:23:39.223
um,

376
00:23:39.320 --> 00:23:43.820
even though the comment your EMR aggressive Manko is extremely,

377
00:23:44.420 --> 00:23:49.120
let's see,
the of dense porous,
yeah.
Uh,

378
00:23:50.090 --> 00:23:53.870
it's still four kilometers long,
right?

379
00:23:53.900 --> 00:23:58.460
Whereas the Rosetta spacecraft is,
uh,
two meters,

380
00:23:58.910 --> 00:24:02.340
right?
So we're,
we're talking quite a difference in scale right.

381
00:24:03.860 --> 00:24:05.750
Also the impact philosophy is very low.

382
00:24:06.730 --> 00:24:10.130
So some of the major science discoveries from Rosetta,
uh,

383
00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:13.850
there's a lot of theories about the source of earth's water and some of those

384
00:24:13.851 --> 00:24:18.550
theories involved commentary,
bombardment periods.
Um,
and you,

385
00:24:18.580 --> 00:24:21.890
it turns out you can fingerprint the source of water by the ratio of the heavy

386
00:24:21.891 --> 00:24:24.350
to light water isotopes that you see.

387
00:24:24.680 --> 00:24:28.940
And so this basically shows the graph of all the different bodies that you know,

388
00:24:28.941 --> 00:24:30.380
we've been able to sample from.

389
00:24:30.830 --> 00:24:33.830
And you have to take some of these with a grain of salt because they remote

390
00:24:33.831 --> 00:24:35.540
sensing measurements.

391
00:24:35.780 --> 00:24:39.660
A Rosetta is very good and it has an in situ measurement of these isotope or

392
00:24:39.661 --> 00:24:42.950
ratios.
So it's inclined to be much more accurate,

393
00:24:43.430 --> 00:24:46.900
but that's the fingerprint of the ratio is different.
Uh,

394
00:24:46.940 --> 00:24:49.970
as you see up here at the top,
it's far above the Blue Line,

395
00:24:49.971 --> 00:24:50.900
which is earth's ratio.

396
00:24:50.900 --> 00:24:55.900
So that tells you that either it was comments from the Kuyper belt and something

397
00:24:56.931 --> 00:25:01.190
else mixing or something happened the water afterwards,
which is really hard.

398
00:25:01.220 --> 00:25:04.850
It's really hard to change these isotopes if you're familiar with like the

399
00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:07.070
production of nuclear weapons.
And stuff.
You know,

400
00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:11.990
that's like one of these things.
It's very hard to do.
Um,
and uh,

401
00:25:12.020 --> 00:25:12.520
so,

402
00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:17.360
so this is very strong evidence that at least Kuyper belt objects can not the

403
00:25:17.361 --> 00:25:19.580
primary source of Earth's water.

404
00:25:20.220 --> 00:25:23.840
Another surprise was curium are brass and Manko is not magnetized.

405
00:25:24.020 --> 00:25:28.850
So many theories of solar system formation had magnetism playing a major role.

406
00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:32.900
There's really not much to change the magnetism of this object,
you know,

407
00:25:33.230 --> 00:25:37.580
after that period.
So since it's not magnetized,
that's evidence.

408
00:25:37.581 --> 00:25:41.300
Strong evidence against the fact that early solar system formation was heavily

409
00:25:41.301 --> 00:25:45.650
driven by that.
All these plumes in beautiful pictures of plumes that we see,

410
00:25:45.980 --> 00:25:49.360
the original mechanism that they thought that those plumes and then outgassing

411
00:25:49.370 --> 00:25:53.990
happened,
it turned out to be wrong.
So they thought that photons hit,

412
00:25:54.170 --> 00:25:58.940
it heats up and you see these jets and you see these plumes make sense?

413
00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:00.950
Turns out that's not what happens.

414
00:26:00.951 --> 00:26:05.930
What happens is the fo the photons hit the,
the uh,

415
00:26:05.990 --> 00:26:07.460
water in CO2 ice.

416
00:26:07.640 --> 00:26:11.330
They liberate electrons by process called photo ionization.

417
00:26:11.510 --> 00:26:16.510
And those I n ionized particles then cause a subsequent reaction that involves

418
00:26:16.911 --> 00:26:21.911
sublimation of those molecules directly from uh,

419
00:26:23.240 --> 00:26:25.910
basically solid to gas form.
Okay.

420
00:26:25.940 --> 00:26:30.920
So this is another one of the major science discoveries from uh,
Rosetta.

421
00:26:31.250 --> 00:26:34.820
Another one is the detection of molecular oxygen at a comment.

422
00:26:35.240 --> 00:26:38.240
Nobody thought that this would be the case.
In fact,
this,

423
00:26:38.270 --> 00:26:41.090
you could argue this is the most surprising discovery.

424
00:26:41.480 --> 00:26:45.600
And again this is from uh,
the cuisine instrument and in situ instrument.

425
00:26:45.601 --> 00:26:47.160
So it's a very reliable,

426
00:26:49.360 --> 00:26:54.120
reliable find in other fascinating discovery is cassava and other one of the in

427
00:26:54.121 --> 00:26:59.070
situ instruments actually has detected organic molecules.
Okay.

428
00:26:59.340 --> 00:27:04.170
So a lot of people think that amino acids,
organics came from comments,

429
00:27:04.171 --> 00:27:08.400
these long carbon chains.
This is very strong evidence for that.

430
00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:10.801
In other,

431
00:27:10.801 --> 00:27:15.801
one of the real surprises is all of the pits that we see on the comment and some

432
00:27:16.531 --> 00:27:18.930
of these are quite deep,
like hundreds of meters deep.

433
00:27:19.230 --> 00:27:23.250
And it turns out what happens is as the comment heats up in this photo

434
00:27:23.251 --> 00:27:27.060
ionization and everything happens,
it's actually happening.

435
00:27:27.061 --> 00:27:29.340
Some of it's sub surface.
So these,

436
00:27:29.560 --> 00:27:34.560
the two and h two o is being liberated subsurface and escaping to this extremely

437
00:27:34.831 --> 00:27:35.700
porous comet.

438
00:27:35.730 --> 00:27:39.480
And then you just have basically a collapse underneath it after too much is

439
00:27:39.481 --> 00:27:44.040
liberated and that's why you see these pits.
Okay.
So again,
these are all things,

440
00:27:44.041 --> 00:27:47.460
these are the reasons why we wanted to go to the comment because we learn all

441
00:27:47.461 --> 00:27:49.050
these new things.
Uh,

442
00:27:49.051 --> 00:27:51.930
there's a lot of other things that I don't have fun graphics about.

443
00:27:52.260 --> 00:27:55.200
The finally lander Kozac and told me to instruments on it,

444
00:27:55.201 --> 00:27:58.440
discovered complex carbon chains as well.
Uh,

445
00:27:58.441 --> 00:28:02.310
Rosina detected glycine,
which is an amino acid.

446
00:28:02.580 --> 00:28:06.270
This is an in situ detection of an amino acid at an extraterrestrial body.

447
00:28:06.450 --> 00:28:10.920
That's an amazing discovery.
Okay.
And there's many,

448
00:28:10.921 --> 00:28:15.330
many more.
Um,
if you're curious,
there's a link there that actually has,

449
00:28:15.331 --> 00:28:17.250
if you Google it,
you can probably find it as well.

450
00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:19.350
It's actually before the end of mission,

451
00:28:19.351 --> 00:28:23.910
they had a series of survey talks on some of the major science discoveries.

452
00:28:24.300 --> 00:28:26.970
Okay.
So that's the fun background part.

453
00:28:27.060 --> 00:28:30.420
And now I'm going to talk a little bit about the AI part.
Okay.

454
00:28:30.840 --> 00:28:35.310
So first I have to start out with a disclaimer.
So there are many,
many,

455
00:28:35.560 --> 00:28:39.060
uh,
elements of Rosetta mission ops.
There's Rosetta,

456
00:28:39.061 --> 00:28:42.600
then there's the science planning,
then the of that,
there's uplink and downlink.

457
00:28:42.810 --> 00:28:44.880
Then within the uplink there's planning.

458
00:28:44.970 --> 00:28:47.460
And then within that there's three phases and mission planning.

459
00:28:47.770 --> 00:28:50.610
I'm going to be talking about the middle phase of mission planning because

460
00:28:50.611 --> 00:28:53.400
that's where we use the different AI tools.
By the way,

461
00:28:53.401 --> 00:28:57.360
this bars are obviously not to scale.
Okay?

462
00:28:57.361 --> 00:29:00.930
So I got asked so many questions about this that I did a controlled experiment,

463
00:29:00.931 --> 00:29:03.900
so I ain't got to ask what is Rosetta Science planning like?

464
00:29:04.410 --> 00:29:07.540
And I used to just say there were a lot of phases.
Um,

465
00:29:07.980 --> 00:29:12.180
and I tried to be a,
since I got all these questions,
I tried to be more precise.

466
00:29:12.181 --> 00:29:17.181
So what I did is I went to my email box and I did a search on Rosetta on this

467
00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:20.730
particular day on the 20th of January,
2015 and at this point in time,

468
00:29:20.970 --> 00:29:22.860
all of these different planning phases we're going on.

469
00:29:22.980 --> 00:29:27.980
So at that point in time we were planning the trajectory for July to October of

470
00:29:28.891 --> 00:29:31.200
2015 so we're in what's called LTP.

471
00:29:31.620 --> 00:29:34.590
Then that the next LTP,

472
00:29:34.620 --> 00:29:38.390
which was march to June of 2015 was in what's called sk,

473
00:29:38.520 --> 00:29:43.420
which is we were taking that trajectory in figuring out what campaigns we're

474
00:29:43.421 --> 00:29:46.390
going to work on that for what measurement campaigns we're going to work and

475
00:29:46.391 --> 00:29:49.870
what we're not going to work,
but in a fairly abstract sense.
Okay.

476
00:29:50.080 --> 00:29:53.920
Like literally taking the observation campaigns from the measurement catalog and

477
00:29:53.921 --> 00:29:55.750
seeing the ones that we're going to be problematic.

478
00:29:56.410 --> 00:29:58.780
Then the next phase is called MTP.

479
00:29:58.810 --> 00:30:02.170
That's medium term planning and then we're planning at the activity or

480
00:30:02.171 --> 00:30:03.130
observation level.

481
00:30:03.550 --> 00:30:08.550
So the AI was used mostly in what's called the SK in the MTP phase to rapidly

482
00:30:08.861 --> 00:30:13.150
iterate among the different alternative measurement strategies.
In after that,

483
00:30:13.480 --> 00:30:17.380
the planning goes into a manual planning tool called maps where they drive it

484
00:30:17.381 --> 00:30:18.850
down to what's called the sequence level,

485
00:30:18.851 --> 00:30:21.700
where those are the actual low level commands that get radiated to the

486
00:30:21.701 --> 00:30:24.540
spacecraft.
And then those are actually delivered in,

487
00:30:24.541 --> 00:30:27.940
in weekly or three and four day bundles.
And then by the way,

488
00:30:28.060 --> 00:30:32.560
all a lot of these same people were at the same time how track frantically

489
00:30:32.590 --> 00:30:35.930
analyzing all the data.
Before that they'd gotten a,

490
00:30:35.950 --> 00:30:39.700
they were like two different special issues of science and nature that came out

491
00:30:39.730 --> 00:30:42.280
even during the,
that's when you realize,
you know,

492
00:30:42.281 --> 00:30:45.670
that you're on a mission that has,
you know,
high science impact.
Um,

493
00:30:45.880 --> 00:30:49.060
when in November when we were deploying the lender,

494
00:30:49.061 --> 00:30:51.760
we heard that there was going to be a special issue of science coming out in

495
00:30:51.761 --> 00:30:55.030
January.
And it's like,
hmm.
In theory,

496
00:30:55.070 --> 00:30:57.970
the primary science mission doesn't start until November.

497
00:30:58.540 --> 00:31:01.750
So what are we saying here about how much science has already been done?

498
00:31:03.910 --> 00:31:07.990
So this is actually a,
one of the medium term plans.

499
00:31:07.991 --> 00:31:10.300
This is one of the most complicated ones that we had.

500
00:31:10.630 --> 00:31:13.570
It has about 2000 observations.
Very importantly,

501
00:31:13.571 --> 00:31:17.890
it has 2000 different pointings in slews of the spacecraft.
So it's Louis.

502
00:31:17.891 --> 00:31:21.400
When we go change from one pointing of the spacecraft to the other,
uh,

503
00:31:22.240 --> 00:31:27.240
there are about 60 active science campaigns for this month and there's also all

504
00:31:28.451 --> 00:31:31.480
of the DSN.
So all of the ground communication stations,

505
00:31:31.510 --> 00:31:33.550
the uplinks in the download links are also in that.

506
00:31:33.730 --> 00:31:38.470
So we have to track that and actually develop that plan very rapidly.

507
00:31:38.500 --> 00:31:39.400
In reality,

508
00:31:39.490 --> 00:31:44.190
there's a frenzied one week where we really take that plan from what's called sk

509
00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:48.220
in the MTP.
And after that it's very,
very hard to substantively change it.

510
00:31:48.850 --> 00:31:52.030
So why is it hard to build this plan?
Uh,
well,

511
00:31:52.031 --> 00:31:54.880
the number one reason for Rosetta is because of geometry.

512
00:31:55.090 --> 00:32:00.040
I mentioned that we have the spacecraft and we're flying around like this.
Well,

513
00:32:00.250 --> 00:32:04.420
the exact view in geometry that we have really is going to impact the kind of

514
00:32:04.421 --> 00:32:07.270
measurement you can take.
And so in remote sensing,

515
00:32:07.271 --> 00:32:11.110
we have what's called the target observer,
illumination geometry.

516
00:32:11.290 --> 00:32:14.830
So the illumination is the sun.
So let's assume it's back there.
These lights.

517
00:32:15.220 --> 00:32:18.550
The target is someplace on the nucleus.
Let's just assume that for now.

518
00:32:18.940 --> 00:32:23.050
And so if I'm here or here,
it's going to look very different.

519
00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:27.550
If I'm looking for plumes,
I want to phase angle,
let's say 130 to 150 degrees.

520
00:32:27.551 --> 00:32:30.250
That means I want to be looking at the comment backlit.

521
00:32:30.520 --> 00:32:35.320
So all the images of plumes that you see,
the comment is all black.
Okay?

522
00:32:35.820 --> 00:32:40.490
Uh,
if I'm looking at the surface,
I want the illumination behind me,
right?

523
00:32:40.940 --> 00:32:42.560
But there's a slight problem.

524
00:32:42.710 --> 00:32:46.550
Turns out the plus z deck is where the camera is an imaging instruments are the

525
00:32:46.551 --> 00:32:49.750
minuses he deck is where the fuel tank is.
Um,

526
00:32:50.360 --> 00:32:53.600
we don't like the fuel tank to get hot for obvious reasons.

527
00:32:53.750 --> 00:32:57.170
So we can't literally go over what's called the sub solar point.

528
00:32:57.200 --> 00:32:59.690
That's why we fly in these different lines segments,

529
00:32:59.720 --> 00:33:03.800
but very rarely go straight across.
Okay.
And by the way,

530
00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:08.180
this comment is rotating at the same time the spacecraft is flying,

531
00:33:08.181 --> 00:33:08.781
it's trajectory.

532
00:33:08.781 --> 00:33:11.630
So you need to be able to identify all of the correct geometries.

533
00:33:11.990 --> 00:33:15.200
And so we actually compute all those.
Extract them.

534
00:33:15.201 --> 00:33:18.020
And that's really what we're searching and we are searching in time,

535
00:33:18.140 --> 00:33:20.660
but we have to extract all the appropriate geometry.

536
00:33:21.260 --> 00:33:25.610
So we actually reason about all these constraints,
all of those vectors,

537
00:33:25.670 --> 00:33:28.130
all the combinations of those vectors.
If it's,

538
00:33:28.190 --> 00:33:30.140
if there's a vector and there's an angle,

539
00:33:30.170 --> 00:33:31.940
probably some scientist is interested in it.

540
00:33:32.600 --> 00:33:36.050
And this is an example of our planning around MTP nine which is the lender

541
00:33:36.051 --> 00:33:39.160
delivery.
And this is an actual observation where a,

542
00:33:39.170 --> 00:33:43.370
for the breach CEO who's the virtus Pi says we want to image with a phase angle

543
00:33:43.371 --> 00:33:47.000
of greater than 80 degrees but be within 15 kilometers of the nucleus.

544
00:33:47.480 --> 00:33:50.900
And the interesting thing is those are the different times that we can do that.

545
00:33:51.110 --> 00:33:53.240
And then maybe you'll get scheduled there.
And he said,

546
00:33:53.241 --> 00:33:55.790
well how come this time did,
didn't get scheduled?

547
00:33:56.060 --> 00:33:58.760
And those are the kinds of questions that we have to answer in the different

548
00:33:58.761 --> 00:34:01.100
scheduling process.
Okay.

549
00:34:02.600 --> 00:34:05.900
The pointing can actually get quite complicated that Alyse spectra that they

550
00:34:05.901 --> 00:34:09.440
talked about,
that instrument is actually a slip.

551
00:34:09.590 --> 00:34:14.300
So that red part indicates the slit in the,
this particular observation,

552
00:34:14.301 --> 00:34:16.370
they want to take scans across the nucleus.

553
00:34:16.670 --> 00:34:20.260
And this is an observation that's very near and dear to my heart because there's

554
00:34:20.270 --> 00:34:23.840
a very similar instrument called you've is on Europa and we want to do these

555
00:34:23.841 --> 00:34:26.600
scans across the Europa Moon.

556
00:34:26.600 --> 00:34:31.280
When we fly in and we want to scan for fresh plumes that again we can detect

557
00:34:31.281 --> 00:34:34.190
spectrally and then if we find a fresh plume,

558
00:34:34.220 --> 00:34:37.820
we want to target that observation on that fly by without the ground in the
loop.

559
00:34:38.210 --> 00:34:39.320
Why do we want to do this?

560
00:34:39.440 --> 00:34:42.550
If you have a plume and you don't catch it until the next time the spacecraft

561
00:34:42.560 --> 00:34:44.960
comes around,
which for Europa is probably 30 days,

562
00:34:45.470 --> 00:34:48.230
those complex organics from that subsurface ocean,

563
00:34:48.231 --> 00:34:50.960
they may already be broken down from there were harsh radiation environment.

564
00:34:51.380 --> 00:34:51.860
Okay,

565
00:34:51.860 --> 00:34:56.360
so that your chance of detecting life or the precursors of life there depends on

566
00:34:56.361 --> 00:34:59.950
being able to do that quickly.
So in this case,
we want to do these skills,

567
00:34:59.990 --> 00:35:01.790
these different scans up and down,

568
00:35:02.180 --> 00:35:05.570
and we have to combine this with all kinds of other problems.
Like,

569
00:35:05.780 --> 00:35:09.050
we don't know exactly where the spacecraft is.
So there's some pointing year.

570
00:35:09.051 --> 00:35:12.140
So you actually have to scan past the edge of the nucleus.

571
00:35:12.980 --> 00:35:17.660
And these get quite complicated.
This is actually showing a morose skin,

572
00:35:17.720 --> 00:35:19.010
which looks like Alice.

573
00:35:19.011 --> 00:35:24.011
So we're sweeping up and down here and then it's going to stop in the middle and

574
00:35:25.460 --> 00:35:29.780
there it stops and then it goes on.
Why did that happen?
Why did it stop?
Well,

575
00:35:29.781 --> 00:35:33.140
it turns out this is a combination of merger of two different instrument

576
00:35:33.141 --> 00:35:36.440
observations.
Or Cyrus wanted to take a picture of the nucleus.

577
00:35:36.620 --> 00:35:39.540
So what we did is we have to plan it.

578
00:35:39.541 --> 00:35:43.710
So you take this picture of the nucleus and then the scan happens to be at that

579
00:35:43.711 --> 00:35:48.360
point.
Okay.
And that's how you try and operate the spacecraft more quickly.

580
00:35:48.361 --> 00:35:52.830
So the pointing is very,
very important.
I already mentioned that you know,

581
00:35:52.831 --> 00:35:56.010
you have to deal with other geometric constraints like the fuel tank.

582
00:35:56.010 --> 00:35:58.470
You also can't point the instruments too close to the sun.

583
00:35:58.500 --> 00:36:02.040
That's not a good thing.
And then there are different pointing tradeoffs.

584
00:36:02.310 --> 00:36:04.440
So as we're flying around,

585
00:36:04.680 --> 00:36:09.120
the spacecraft is designed so that it goes sideways with the solar panels

586
00:36:09.150 --> 00:36:12.840
cutting through the gas while the imaging instruments are pointed at the
nucleus.

587
00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:13.921
And by the way,

588
00:36:13.921 --> 00:36:18.300
all those in situ instruments were all those science and nature papers came
from.

589
00:36:18.720 --> 00:36:21.810
They're pointed in what's called the Ram Direction,
the Delta v Direction.

590
00:36:22.080 --> 00:36:26.520
So everybody's happy until some imaging scientist says,
you know,

591
00:36:26.760 --> 00:36:29.220
if I'm in close and I look out,

592
00:36:29.460 --> 00:36:33.150
I can measure the gas cloud very precisely.

593
00:36:33.690 --> 00:36:37.980
So they like that.
But then all the in situ instrument people said,

594
00:36:38.010 --> 00:36:41.340
what you're screwing with my data,
you're totally messing with my data.

595
00:36:41.670 --> 00:36:45.270
So what do we have to do?
We have to measure,

596
00:36:45.750 --> 00:36:48.150
we have to measure how much of the gas cloud,

597
00:36:48.151 --> 00:36:51.090
how many particles are going to be hitting the detectors at various points in

598
00:36:51.091 --> 00:36:54.210
time.
And for some of the instruments they need a background signal.

599
00:36:54.211 --> 00:36:59.211
So you don't get any data for the first 15 minutes after you SLU.

600
00:36:59.760 --> 00:37:04.760
So the short story here is you really don't want to point away the z deck away

601
00:37:06.181 --> 00:37:07.560
from Nadir when you're near.

602
00:37:07.770 --> 00:37:12.050
And then how far off you point in how close you are when you,

603
00:37:12.060 --> 00:37:14.630
how close to the nucleus yard when you point those are trades.

604
00:37:14.631 --> 00:37:18.900
So we did a series of trade studies on how much science we would be losing of

605
00:37:18.901 --> 00:37:19.710
each type.

606
00:37:19.710 --> 00:37:22.760
And so that's one of the advantages of having the automated planting system.

607
00:37:22.790 --> 00:37:24.570
You can do all these trade studies are easily,

608
00:37:25.920 --> 00:37:29.390
you also have to optimize different kinds of pointings.
Um,

609
00:37:29.760 --> 00:37:31.800
if I'm sitting here and I'm,

610
00:37:32.290 --> 00:37:37.290
the son is back there and I'm looking at the nucleus and I have what's called

611
00:37:37.441 --> 00:37:41.010
the inertial target,
that's a target that's not moving with the comment.

612
00:37:41.070 --> 00:37:42.510
So let's suppose it's a guide star.

613
00:37:42.540 --> 00:37:45.480
It's in the corner there and the corner of the room there.

614
00:37:45.870 --> 00:37:50.340
If I'm on this side of the comment and I slew over there,
it's a very small SLU.

615
00:37:50.700 --> 00:37:53.010
If I'm on this side of the comment and I slew over there,

616
00:37:53.011 --> 00:37:55.170
it's almost 180 degrees,
right?

617
00:37:56.160 --> 00:37:59.310
Because we have 30 meters solar panels on the Rosetta spacecraft.

618
00:37:59.311 --> 00:38:01.370
It's not very agile.
That 30 minutes,

619
00:38:01.410 --> 00:38:05.100
that 180 degrees slew would take you over 20 minutes.

620
00:38:05.640 --> 00:38:10.640
So we act to actually group the different initial targets when they are shorter

621
00:38:11.221 --> 00:38:16.110
distances.
Okay.
And then there's this other problem.
We have a the antenna,

622
00:38:16.111 --> 00:38:18.090
if we slew too quickly that Gimbal,

623
00:38:18.091 --> 00:38:22.440
the antenna can no longer pointed earth and we are downlinking data all the
time.

624
00:38:22.890 --> 00:38:25.950
And that's because we don't have a lot of power.
So our data rates not that high.

625
00:38:26.550 --> 00:38:30.900
So all of these pointing things really,
really flow into the planning problem.

626
00:38:31.410 --> 00:38:33.910
In other thing is we have structured observation.

627
00:38:33.911 --> 00:38:37.180
So this is an example of one of the most complicated structured observations,

628
00:38:37.990 --> 00:38:41.650
all those beautiful pictures and three d models that you see of the commentary

629
00:38:41.651 --> 00:38:44.830
on grass,
the Manko,
those are from oh Cyrus maps.
So what did they do?

630
00:38:45.730 --> 00:38:49.540
They use the rotation of the nucleus and then the stripe up and down it

631
00:38:49.550 --> 00:38:51.400
longitudinally.
Okay.

632
00:38:51.880 --> 00:38:56.260
And so that's how you construct a map of the entire nucleus.
What does that mean?

633
00:38:56.261 --> 00:38:58.390
That means over 12 or 13 hours,

634
00:38:58.391 --> 00:39:01.330
you want a series of images and each image will take us here in the amount of

635
00:39:01.331 --> 00:39:04.090
time.
That's exactly what's being scheduled here.

636
00:39:04.360 --> 00:39:07.780
But note that the spacing is not perfect because there are different operations

637
00:39:07.781 --> 00:39:12.100
constraints where you can't get the spacecraft.
So to an AI person,

638
00:39:12.190 --> 00:39:16.030
I would say this is it.
Multi objective optimization problem.

639
00:39:16.360 --> 00:39:20.050
These are all of the different science concerns that Holger Spherex who'd be the

640
00:39:20.051 --> 00:39:23.260
oh Cyrus Pi would bring up.
He would say,
well,

641
00:39:23.590 --> 00:39:27.490
in this month I asked for three groupings,
three of these mappings,
but really,

642
00:39:27.491 --> 00:39:30.880
can I have four?
Um,
and by the way,

643
00:39:30.910 --> 00:39:35.560
I want those evenly spaced throughout that month.
Oh,
in all of those groupings,

644
00:39:35.590 --> 00:39:39.040
I want all 12 images.
If you give me 10 of them,

645
00:39:39.070 --> 00:39:43.300
then that's not as good as an overall schedule.
And within that grouping,

646
00:39:43.330 --> 00:39:45.880
they were all supposed to be evenly spaced.
Right?

647
00:39:47.050 --> 00:39:51.580
Then there's this other fun thing.
They navigate the spacecraft twice per week,

648
00:39:51.581 --> 00:39:54.790
every fourth in third day alternatingly oddly enough,

649
00:39:54.791 --> 00:39:57.430
right after the navigate the space craft,
they know better where it is.

650
00:39:57.431 --> 00:39:59.140
When they know better where the spacecraft is,

651
00:39:59.141 --> 00:40:01.930
that means you're pointing years lower.
Shockingly,

652
00:40:01.960 --> 00:40:05.530
everybody wants to observe when the pointing years lower,
right?

653
00:40:06.130 --> 00:40:10.510
And then the distance to target is also changing.
As I mentioned,
as you fly by,

654
00:40:10.660 --> 00:40:13.840
you fly these line segments,
you get closer and you get further away,

655
00:40:14.200 --> 00:40:16.480
there's an optimal distance at target.
And furthermore,

656
00:40:16.481 --> 00:40:19.810
you don't want variation in the distance to target across these groupings.

657
00:40:20.230 --> 00:40:24.250
The local time is changing as the nucleus rotates.

658
00:40:24.251 --> 00:40:26.050
So basically when you get off cadence,

659
00:40:26.320 --> 00:40:30.220
the local time of your stripes will now change.
That's not good for the mapping.

660
00:40:30.730 --> 00:40:33.430
And then the emission angle changes in addition,

661
00:40:33.520 --> 00:40:37.570
because we're not just staying at the equator because as we go north and south,

662
00:40:37.780 --> 00:40:39.850
that emission angle is now changing.

663
00:40:40.120 --> 00:40:45.040
So the way I would phrase this is it's a multi objective optimization problem.

664
00:40:45.280 --> 00:40:46.113
And by the way,

665
00:40:46.120 --> 00:40:50.980
we don't have the objective function and the scientists will just tell you when

666
00:40:50.981 --> 00:40:54.190
you're,
um,
until they change their mind,
right?

667
00:40:54.550 --> 00:40:59.170
So there's actually researchers who are interested in formulating this actually

668
00:40:59.171 --> 00:41:01.880
as one of these oracle based objective,
you know,

669
00:41:01.960 --> 00:41:04.240
trying to infer the objective function.

670
00:41:04.241 --> 00:41:08.110
So there's some interesting work going on there.
By the way,

671
00:41:08.380 --> 00:41:13.210
the scientists also have to interleave all of this with all kinds of engineering

672
00:41:13.211 --> 00:41:17.470
activities.
So the navigation of the spacecraft,
firing a thrusters and so on.

673
00:41:17.770 --> 00:41:20.740
So in that previous example for a Cyrus,

674
00:41:20.741 --> 00:41:22.720
and this is a different example for Alice,

675
00:41:23.110 --> 00:41:27.550
we can't have the Alis covers open within 30 minutes of a thrust you're firing

676
00:41:27.551 --> 00:41:28.900
cause that would contaminate the instrument.

677
00:41:28.901 --> 00:41:31.720
So that's an example of an engineering constraint.

678
00:41:32.050 --> 00:41:36.350
And then arguably one of the most complicated constraints is downlink
management.

679
00:41:36.620 --> 00:41:40.190
So as we acquire all of this data,
it's filling these buffers.

680
00:41:40.270 --> 00:41:44.960
There's 14 to 18 of them depending on how you count the engineering buffers and

681
00:41:45.530 --> 00:41:48.860
we stream the data into them and we have to downlink it without overflowing it.

682
00:41:48.861 --> 00:41:51.890
Otherwise you just lost that data that you worked so hard to get.

683
00:41:52.340 --> 00:41:54.140
And so that's actually a very hard problem,

684
00:41:54.141 --> 00:41:56.060
particularly when we're doing these mapping campaigns,

685
00:41:56.061 --> 00:42:00.410
we actually have to empty the buffers.
Then we frantically downlink massively.

686
00:42:00.410 --> 00:42:03.710
We get all these down links to downlink that data as we're acquiring it.

687
00:42:03.860 --> 00:42:08.660
And still,
by the way,
at the end is you can see here we're completely full,
right?

688
00:42:09.020 --> 00:42:12.980
So this is actually one of the major areas of automation here.
Okay.

689
00:42:13.070 --> 00:42:15.890
So where is the AI scheduling?
Well,

690
00:42:16.040 --> 00:42:20.270
it turns out all those constraints that I talked about pretty much are modeled

691
00:42:20.390 --> 00:42:24.470
in Aspen and we have to actually track them and enforce them.
Okay.

692
00:42:24.770 --> 00:42:28.180
So there are all these science constraints cause all these health constraints of

693
00:42:28.181 --> 00:42:31.370
the space craft and some of them are hard constraints and then some of them are

694
00:42:31.371 --> 00:42:35.810
soft constraints.
Generally speaking,
we attempt to satisfy the soft constraints,

695
00:42:35.811 --> 00:42:39.620
but we don't unfortunately do this multi objective optimization.

696
00:42:39.860 --> 00:42:43.850
Maybe the next mission.
Uh,
and then how do we search?

697
00:42:44.150 --> 00:42:48.380
We actually take the,
we take the constraints and we break them into two parts.

698
00:42:48.560 --> 00:42:51.050
The first part are relatively static.

699
00:42:51.320 --> 00:42:55.700
We solve them and then we use that as a guide to solving the dynamic
constraints.

700
00:42:55.730 --> 00:42:58.220
And then that's where we really have to do the heavy duty search.

701
00:42:58.490 --> 00:43:02.330
What are the static constraints?
Well,
once we have the trajectory,

702
00:43:02.360 --> 00:43:05.360
most of those geometric constraints are now static,
right?

703
00:43:05.810 --> 00:43:10.370
Because the geometry,
the relative geometry of the spacecraft and the nucleus,

704
00:43:10.640 --> 00:43:12.740
it's not changing.
Or at least if it is,

705
00:43:12.741 --> 00:43:16.100
you're not able to know that it's going to change.
However,

706
00:43:16.101 --> 00:43:17.540
some of the other things are dynamic.

707
00:43:17.600 --> 00:43:20.710
The resources are dynamic because when you place a few observations,

708
00:43:20.720 --> 00:43:25.580
they're consuming resources that the other,
the other uh,
observations would need.

709
00:43:26.030 --> 00:43:30.710
What else is dynamic?
Some of the geometry,
like where you're pointing and seeing,

710
00:43:30.720 --> 00:43:32.990
you know,
how long the fuel tank has been in the sun.

711
00:43:33.350 --> 00:43:37.580
So we actually take all the static parts of the problem,
we extract them,

712
00:43:37.820 --> 00:43:40.040
then we search in,
solve that problem,

713
00:43:40.280 --> 00:43:44.900
and then we use that as a guide for the dynamic search.
Okay.
And what does this,

714
00:43:44.930 --> 00:43:47.780
what does this really look like?
This looks like what we have at the bottom here.

715
00:43:47.781 --> 00:43:51.650
We have a set of observations.
We look for gaps in the schedule,

716
00:43:51.680 --> 00:43:52.730
usually in pointing,

717
00:43:52.940 --> 00:43:56.300
and then we try and insert the observations in places where they satisfy the

718
00:43:56.301 --> 00:44:00.470
constraint.
And so this is actually showing what that really looks like.

719
00:44:00.770 --> 00:44:04.250
These green intervals here are the different constraints.

720
00:44:04.310 --> 00:44:07.760
There's about 25 of them that we modeled different feasibility windows.

721
00:44:08.240 --> 00:44:12.700
And then this is literally an animation of the search as it's trying the

722
00:44:12.710 --> 00:44:16.460
different combinations of the groupings.
And if your eyesight is really good,

723
00:44:16.490 --> 00:44:21.140
you can see that these in fact the solutions that the schedulers come up with,

724
00:44:21.530 --> 00:44:26.180
at least for now.
Uh,
so this is basically what I said.

725
00:44:26.181 --> 00:44:29.870
We take a satisficing temporal solution and we take all the static constraints,

726
00:44:29.871 --> 00:44:32.550
we compile them in their constraint network form.

727
00:44:33.030 --> 00:44:37.530
We take that and we search in that for all the dynamic constraints.

728
00:44:37.770 --> 00:44:40.950
We actually compute all of the validity intervals,

729
00:44:40.951 --> 00:44:43.980
all those green and white constraint intervals.
In theory,

730
00:44:43.981 --> 00:44:47.820
you only have to winnow them down,
but we compute them all.
Why do we do that?

731
00:44:47.821 --> 00:44:50.190
Because the scientists will always come back to us and say,

732
00:44:50.191 --> 00:44:54.330
why didn't my observation gets scheduled here?
And so you have to go and say,

733
00:44:54.390 --> 00:44:58.340
well here are the four constraints that you told me and this is how they're

734
00:44:58.350 --> 00:45:01.470
violated.
And that particular point,
the downlink scheduling,

735
00:45:01.471 --> 00:45:04.170
we actually enforce after we scheduled the observations.

736
00:45:04.171 --> 00:45:07.200
And that's because there are other triggers that the schedule is not allowed to

737
00:45:07.201 --> 00:45:11.370
pull.
But the operations team can pull to say,
oh,
those eight images,

738
00:45:11.371 --> 00:45:15.570
those are now video images in order to make the schedule work.
And then finally,

739
00:45:15.880 --> 00:45:17.670
originally when we deployed the scheduler,

740
00:45:17.671 --> 00:45:21.090
there was squeaky wheel optimization around this whole loop.
What does that mean?

741
00:45:21.091 --> 00:45:24.570
That means you take the highest priority observations that didn't get in,

742
00:45:24.600 --> 00:45:26.700
you increment their priority and you try it again.

743
00:45:28.260 --> 00:45:29.880
As we got into operations,

744
00:45:30.270 --> 00:45:35.160
what ended up happening is the operations engineer became that optimization

745
00:45:35.161 --> 00:45:36.450
loop.
Okay.

746
00:45:36.660 --> 00:45:41.660
Because it was faster for the people who are very smart to tweak the priorities

747
00:45:42.120 --> 00:45:46.530
and try and get whatever result that would,
you know,
the,
the,
the,

748
00:45:46.531 --> 00:45:49.170
the best of their knowledge that the scientists would be happy with.

749
00:45:49.860 --> 00:45:53.040
The second part of the scheduling,
the downlink management,

750
00:45:53.160 --> 00:45:55.860
this is just a different blow up of,
of it.

751
00:45:56.040 --> 00:45:58.560
And you can see there are these different buffers that are being tracked.

752
00:45:58.800 --> 00:46:03.600
And so the scientists and the engineers would actually take the solution that we

753
00:46:03.601 --> 00:46:05.160
would find in our heuristic search.

754
00:46:05.400 --> 00:46:07.680
And then in some cases they might try and tweak it,

755
00:46:08.250 --> 00:46:12.000
but actually you fairly rarely because it's actually a very hard problem to

756
00:46:12.001 --> 00:46:15.390
solve at the MTP level.
You can think of it as a 300 variable,

757
00:46:16.530 --> 00:46:20.110
mostly linear programming problem.
Um,

758
00:46:20.250 --> 00:46:22.470
what are examples of the plan sizes we looked at?

759
00:46:22.471 --> 00:46:24.720
I already kind of gave you some examples of this.

760
00:46:24.980 --> 00:46:27.690
They are on the ballpark of 2000 observations.

761
00:46:27.691 --> 00:46:31.020
Those would expand out into tens of thousands of constraints that have to be

762
00:46:31.021 --> 00:46:31.854
checked.

763
00:46:31.860 --> 00:46:36.240
One of the most significant contributions we've made to the mission is during

764
00:46:36.241 --> 00:46:37.500
the land or delivery phase,

765
00:46:37.501 --> 00:46:41.160
we had to manage multiple contingencies and then the engineering team was

766
00:46:41.161 --> 00:46:43.230
changing what they were going to do in order to like,

767
00:46:43.260 --> 00:46:44.940
correct the navigation and so on.

768
00:46:45.300 --> 00:46:49.190
So at one point in time and there we had three different contingencies times and

769
00:46:49.191 --> 00:46:52.230
other two contingencies of land or abort.
Uh,

770
00:46:52.470 --> 00:46:54.870
and we would take what's called the PTSL,

771
00:46:54.871 --> 00:46:58.110
which is the engineering plan and we had to turn it around within hours.

772
00:46:58.260 --> 00:47:01.320
So they would completely change the engineering plan and we would have to Redo

773
00:47:01.321 --> 00:47:04.820
the science plan around it in about an hour.
Um,

774
00:47:05.310 --> 00:47:08.740
how did all of this workout?
Uh,
it worked out quite well.
Uh,

775
00:47:08.760 --> 00:47:10.740
before we actually got to the comment,

776
00:47:10.770 --> 00:47:14.970
we did two sets of deliveries of science plans for about eight months each.

777
00:47:15.030 --> 00:47:16.500
Each one covered about eight months,

778
00:47:16.770 --> 00:47:19.920
and this was used to assess the different science campaigns,

779
00:47:20.130 --> 00:47:23.700
how feasible they were to operate on the orbiter,

780
00:47:24.180 --> 00:47:26.670
and significant changes had to be made from this.

781
00:47:26.671 --> 00:47:31.120
There are two campaigns that it turned out of the 350 or so science campaigns

782
00:47:31.480 --> 00:47:35.050
that in the original forum would've taken three sevenths of the free observation

783
00:47:35.051 --> 00:47:38.410
time of the entire mission.
So obviously that's not going to happen.

784
00:47:38.411 --> 00:47:39.640
So they had to be redesigned.

785
00:47:41.130 --> 00:47:46.030
The Rosetta spacecraft woke up in January,
2014.
Uh,
aspen was used in this,
uh,

786
00:47:46.060 --> 00:47:49.790
as I said,
this midterm activity planning,
um,
uh,

787
00:47:50.260 --> 00:47:54.910
into the escort phase,
uh,
including multiple contingencies until about,

788
00:47:55.140 --> 00:47:58.000
um,
spring of 2015.

789
00:47:58.300 --> 00:48:02.230
And so a total of about 28 MTPs were delivered using aspen.

790
00:48:03.160 --> 00:48:07.460
However,
what happened in the spring of 2015 is,
uh,

791
00:48:07.810 --> 00:48:12.810
the spacecraft was flying too close to the nucleus and the dust cloud blinded to

792
00:48:13.511 --> 00:48:17.500
star trackers.
It actually was a very dangerous event.
It took them three days.

793
00:48:17.501 --> 00:48:19.150
Do we gain control of the spacecraft?

794
00:48:19.990 --> 00:48:23.710
We easily could have lost the spacecraft then.
So based on that,

795
00:48:23.711 --> 00:48:26.680
they decided they would no longer have a plan,
a preplanned,

796
00:48:26.681 --> 00:48:28.900
deliberative trajectory,
like six months in advance,

797
00:48:28.930 --> 00:48:30.430
even with the two contingencies.

798
00:48:30.790 --> 00:48:34.000
And instead what they decided is there would be a notional trajectory and they

799
00:48:34.001 --> 00:48:36.820
would just try and fly as close to the common as possible.

800
00:48:37.210 --> 00:48:41.200
And so what that meant is a lot of the pre planning and optimization that aspen

801
00:48:41.210 --> 00:48:43.060
was involved in was no longer possible.

802
00:48:43.450 --> 00:48:47.350
And so they actually took the constraints that were implemented and Aspen and

803
00:48:47.351 --> 00:48:51.460
basically forced them into the preceding and following phase.
In other words,

804
00:48:51.461 --> 00:48:54.580
in the maps.
And then actually the LTP,
believe it or not,

805
00:48:54.581 --> 00:48:59.350
it's even excel spreadsheet where they enforce the constraints.
Uh,
and so that's,

806
00:48:59.380 --> 00:49:02.890
that was the planning process that they went on with for the remainder of the

807
00:49:02.891 --> 00:49:07.830
mission,
which is a little more than a year.
Uh,
the data management system,
uh,

808
00:49:07.870 --> 00:49:11.710
d Alec was continue is continued to be used and it actually was used until the

809
00:49:11.711 --> 00:49:14.320
end of mission.
So that part was still automated scheduling.

810
00:49:14.980 --> 00:49:18.400
So let me just finish up here.
What's next?
Well,

811
00:49:18.490 --> 00:49:21.520
we would like to take these same technologies and put them on board the

812
00:49:21.521 --> 00:49:26.140
spacecraft.
Uh,
this is actually a video that we used,
um,

813
00:49:26.290 --> 00:49:28.530
that's running a CMU that's showing a simulation.

814
00:49:28.540 --> 00:49:32.110
It's actually uses Rosetta data and it shows us smart fly by.

815
00:49:32.290 --> 00:49:34.720
So instead of pre planning out these campaigns,

816
00:49:34.721 --> 00:49:39.721
where we'd like to do is take a whole bunch of oh Cyrus images and look for

817
00:49:39.731 --> 00:49:44.731
plumes and that those are the large boxes in the yellow line that you see is not

818
00:49:45.491 --> 00:49:49.610
a laser where we're shooting the,
the nucleus.
It's in fact showing,
uh,

819
00:49:49.611 --> 00:49:54.611
a small field of view instrument like Miro that's imaging the base of a plume

820
00:49:54.760 --> 00:49:56.890
that's been discovered in the large imagery in here.

821
00:49:56.891 --> 00:50:01.750
You can see the fly by so fast that the spacecraft can't actually keep the

822
00:50:01.751 --> 00:50:04.690
nucleus interview.
Why would we like to do something like this?

823
00:50:04.840 --> 00:50:08.230
Because right now we don't have any narrow field of view imagery of those

824
00:50:08.231 --> 00:50:10.030
specific point targets.
Why?

825
00:50:10.240 --> 00:50:12.640
Because because it's a narrow field of view instrument.

826
00:50:12.641 --> 00:50:16.480
What are the chances you're going to actually get the base of the blue?

827
00:50:16.630 --> 00:50:19.270
There are other things you'd like to do,
like trace,
the edge of the plume.

828
00:50:19.450 --> 00:50:22.840
All of those things are possible if you have the onboard autonomy.

829
00:50:23.800 --> 00:50:26.320
And just so you don't think that this is completely made up,

830
00:50:26.740 --> 00:50:30.430
these are actually some of the initial algorithms we have shown.

831
00:50:30.431 --> 00:50:33.770
The ability to track the plumes,
actually track them across flame,

832
00:50:34.130 --> 00:50:39.130
across frames and actually tracking them across frames is a very powerful

833
00:50:39.351 --> 00:50:43.880
technique because the plumes actually persist over time.
Uh,
there's,

834
00:50:43.910 --> 00:50:47.810
there's similar techniques where we want to do this in an earth observing a

835
00:50:47.811 --> 00:50:52.490
autonomous system where you would have to re task just within minutes.

836
00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:54.520
And then,
um,

837
00:50:54.950 --> 00:50:58.800
the most exciting thing lately is what's called Ocean worlds.
Uh,

838
00:50:58.880 --> 00:51:02.720
we now believe that there are underneath large ice caps,

839
00:51:02.900 --> 00:51:07.100
ocean worlds at Europa,
Enceladus,
Triton,

840
00:51:07.160 --> 00:51:08.930
and even Pluto.
Okay.

841
00:51:09.260 --> 00:51:13.580
And these are some of the primary locations where we might find extant life in

842
00:51:13.581 --> 00:51:18.500
our solar system.
And that's because we have liquid,
we have energy sources,

843
00:51:18.501 --> 00:51:21.170
we have gradients,
or we believe we have all of those.

844
00:51:21.530 --> 00:51:25.850
So we'd like to go to Europa,
melt our way,
or burn our way through the ice cap,

845
00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:30.290
deploy a submersible.
We don't know what this underwater ocean looks like,

846
00:51:30.291 --> 00:51:33.920
but we know if we have a submersible,
it will have a NASA logo on it.
Evidently.

847
00:51:35.180 --> 00:51:39.250
Uh,
and then this is a a little bit inaccurate.
So because the,

848
00:51:39.410 --> 00:51:42.500
the scientist would say,
oh,
let's go look at that water ice boundary.

849
00:51:42.501 --> 00:51:46.600
The engineers would say,
ah,
pointy,
sharp object.
Right?
Um,

850
00:51:46.610 --> 00:51:49.370
so more likely you would sample from a plume,

851
00:51:49.430 --> 00:51:53.180
from a hydrothermal vent because this is one of the most likely sources of life.

852
00:51:53.890 --> 00:51:57.260
In fact,
there's a guy on my team right now who's on a German icebreaker,

853
00:51:57.261 --> 00:52:01.650
the polar stern at 85 north investigating with called the Karasik Massif,

854
00:52:01.970 --> 00:52:04.790
which is an Arctic hydrothermal vent,
uh,

855
00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:08.270
where they're searching for new life forms right there.

856
00:52:09.410 --> 00:52:12.650
And then just if that wasn't exciting enough for you,

857
00:52:12.651 --> 00:52:14.810
the ultimate challenge is in interstellar mission.

858
00:52:15.080 --> 00:52:19.580
You'd have like a 50 or 60 year cruise to go to the closest star when you go

859
00:52:19.581 --> 00:52:22.490
there.
The One way light time is four and a half years.

860
00:52:22.491 --> 00:52:24.980
So you're probably not joysticking that spacecraft.

861
00:52:25.220 --> 00:52:28.220
It's pretty much autonomous submersible.

862
00:52:28.220 --> 00:52:31.940
I talked about would have to be autonomous for let's say 10,
20,
30 days.

863
00:52:32.270 --> 00:52:36.440
This is 80 years of autonomy.
So,
uh,

864
00:52:37.130 --> 00:52:41.750
for going wormholes or something like that,
this is how it's gotta be.
Um,

865
00:52:42.110 --> 00:52:46.350
JPL has a long line of,
you know,
AI based,
uh,

866
00:52:46.351 --> 00:52:49.660
autonomous systems.
Uh,
we're very proud of them.
Um,

867
00:52:50.180 --> 00:52:55.100
I was actually reviewing this talk just yesterday night and that's when I had to

868
00:52:55.101 --> 00:52:58.100
change the Rosetta from the Yellow Fund to the White Fund,

869
00:52:58.130 --> 00:53:00.810
which means it's no longer operational.
Uh,

870
00:53:00.860 --> 00:53:03.020
but we're very proud that a lot of these spacecraft,

871
00:53:03.021 --> 00:53:05.600
we are the operational system used to command them.

872
00:53:05.601 --> 00:53:09.490
We have flight software on board,
both MSL and Murnau.
Uh,

873
00:53:09.500 --> 00:53:12.140
we have the software that schedules the deep space network,

874
00:53:12.141 --> 00:53:13.580
all the communications antennas.

875
00:53:13.581 --> 00:53:16.610
So Ai is very much alive and well at JPL and NASA.

876
00:53:17.630 --> 00:53:19.070
So just to summarize here,

877
00:53:19.560 --> 00:53:24.350
I hope you've all come away with the understanding that for a complex mission,

878
00:53:24.351 --> 00:53:27.450
like Rosetta,
the scheduling of the mission is very hard.

879
00:53:27.450 --> 00:53:29.640
That's behind the scenes to enable the science.

880
00:53:30.060 --> 00:53:33.180
There's a lot of different constraints and a lot of constraints that are

881
00:53:33.181 --> 00:53:35.910
articulated hard engineering constraints as well as ones that are not

882
00:53:35.911 --> 00:53:40.140
articulated.
Um,
they're competing science campaigns.

883
00:53:40.320 --> 00:53:41.820
Most of the constraints or soft,

884
00:53:42.040 --> 00:53:45.510
the typical planning process for one of these missions would be very interactive

885
00:53:45.511 --> 00:53:49.770
and incremental.
What are the implications for Ai Research?
Well,
first of all,

886
00:53:49.771 --> 00:53:54.030
we can take heart that AI is being used in such a big mission like this.

887
00:53:54.390 --> 00:53:56.640
But to me the lessons are,

888
00:53:57.000 --> 00:54:01.080
a lot of these basics of AI maybe aren't so sexy anymore,

889
00:54:01.110 --> 00:54:04.140
but they are considered,
you know,
like in your first year,
second AI course,

890
00:54:04.141 --> 00:54:08.130
you already learned about them.
Constrained enforcement,
constraint propagation,

891
00:54:08.490 --> 00:54:10.020
uh,
horistic search.

892
00:54:10.410 --> 00:54:13.680
These are all important for scheduled generation,

893
00:54:13.710 --> 00:54:16.770
but almost more importantly,
problem analysis,

894
00:54:16.800 --> 00:54:19.170
observation campaign in constraint analysis.

895
00:54:19.590 --> 00:54:24.060
And in this particular use case,
the scheduler is not automating everything.

896
00:54:24.060 --> 00:54:27.750
It's amplifying the human's ability to explore more alternatives,

897
00:54:28.200 --> 00:54:31.410
explore more of the,
um,
schedule,
search space.

898
00:54:31.650 --> 00:54:35.160
And one thing I would say that's very important here is it's actually in these

899
00:54:35.161 --> 00:54:38.940
cases it's more important to be able to understand what the scheduler did.
Then,

900
00:54:38.941 --> 00:54:41.280
you know,
maybe a 0.5% better solution.

901
00:54:42.750 --> 00:54:44.460
So just a different acknowledgements.

902
00:54:44.550 --> 00:54:49.550
I always have to start off with acknowledging my wife because she allowed me to

903
00:54:49.771 --> 00:54:50.970
work on this project.

904
00:54:50.971 --> 00:54:54.060
It was a three year project that turned out to be a five year project and

905
00:54:54.061 --> 00:54:58.560
project with no operations that turned out to have a lot of operations including

906
00:54:58.561 --> 00:55:02.520
one week a month in Madrid for the primary phase Freelander delivery.

907
00:55:03.290 --> 00:55:07.470
Uh,
so I have to thank,
my wife were still being with me through all of this.

908
00:55:08.070 --> 00:55:08.903
Um,

909
00:55:08.940 --> 00:55:13.230
aspen is a joint NASA Jpl Isa effort have to acknowledge all the wonderful

910
00:55:13.231 --> 00:55:15.810
collaborators that we've had at east side and some of them were working with.

911
00:55:15.840 --> 00:55:18.390
Even now on the juice mission,
uh,

912
00:55:18.391 --> 00:55:22.740
we have to acknowledge the larger team in of course,
our technology sponsors.

913
00:55:23.100 --> 00:55:26.910
And finally a tragically last year we lost our,
uh,

914
00:55:26.911 --> 00:55:31.320
US was at a project scientist,
Claudia Alexander.
Um,

915
00:55:31.530 --> 00:55:35.840
and uh,
in memory to her,
uh,
I always note this as a,

916
00:55:35.920 --> 00:55:40.020
in all my talks,
he was very,
very influential and science.

917
00:55:40.021 --> 00:55:44.920
She's also the former,
uh,
Galileo project manager and very much a stem advocate.

918
00:55:44.921 --> 00:55:49.580
And role model for women in science and should be commended and remembered,
uh,

919
00:55:49.590 --> 00:55:51.360
with that.
Thank you all for your attention.

920
00:55:52.790 --> 00:55:57.680
<v 0>[inaudible]</v>

921
00:55:58.160 --> 00:56:02.000
<v 1>you mentioned not having this objective function for what you're doing,</v>

922
00:56:02.001 --> 00:56:07.001
is that mainly because it's such a difficult problem space or is that also a

923
00:56:07.851 --> 00:56:12.680
difficulty in assigning relative weights?
Are merits to different science tasks?

924
00:56:13.270 --> 00:56:15.350
Uh,
I would say yes to both of them.

925
00:56:15.500 --> 00:56:20.500
So it's also the nature of the mission is very interdisciplinary and there are

926
00:56:20.901 --> 00:56:24.340
so many diverse instruments,
so we specific problems,

927
00:56:24.910 --> 00:56:28.540
particularly NASA that we do know the objective function.
So for example,

928
00:56:28.541 --> 00:56:29.800
if you're mapping the planet,

929
00:56:30.190 --> 00:56:33.190
then there are some measures of coverage that you can assess and these are

930
00:56:33.191 --> 00:56:35.830
quantitative,
so it's more like,
you know,

931
00:56:35.831 --> 00:56:37.630
if you're scheduling your production line,

932
00:56:37.631 --> 00:56:39.340
you know what your quality metrics are,

933
00:56:39.341 --> 00:56:43.780
you want to produce as many widgets as possible.
Um,
but still,
uh,

934
00:56:43.781 --> 00:56:46.540
even that's quite complicated.
There's a mission called [inaudible],

935
00:56:46.570 --> 00:56:50.200
which is a interferometric synthetic aperture radar,
um,

936
00:56:50.290 --> 00:56:54.550
mission that's jointly between JPL,
NASA and the Indian Space Agency.

937
00:56:54.850 --> 00:56:56.980
And so they have these different coverage metrics,

938
00:56:57.100 --> 00:57:00.460
but it turns out there's about 50 different science campaigns and each one has

939
00:57:00.461 --> 00:57:03.670
its own coverage in metric.
And so one is monitoring glaciers and the other is,

940
00:57:03.671 --> 00:57:05.410
you know,
looking at earthquake faults and another.

941
00:57:05.710 --> 00:57:07.870
And so when you look at the combination of all of them,

942
00:57:07.871 --> 00:57:10.570
well then it's not quite so clear what your objective function is.

943
00:57:10.960 --> 00:57:14.860
But there I think you have a fighting chance,
uh,
on a mission.
Like Rosetta,

944
00:57:14.980 --> 00:57:18.430
it's to interdisciplinary.
Certain things just have to meet negotiated.

945
00:57:18.580 --> 00:57:22.860
So really you have to look at it as a,

946
00:57:23.320 --> 00:57:26.470
what we call an IAA problem,
intelligence amplification,

947
00:57:26.471 --> 00:57:28.840
not really a completely automated problem.

948
00:57:29.030 --> 00:57:33.140
<v 6>So you mentioned several times,
uh,
flying and like a line segment.</v>

949
00:57:33.141 --> 00:57:37.370
So I was curious about that and why,
you know,
it seems like flying,

950
00:57:37.371 --> 00:57:39.890
like in curves around that would be more fuel efficient,

951
00:57:41.070 --> 00:57:43.970
<v 1>uh,
except you're not,
not,</v>

952
00:57:44.060 --> 00:57:48.290
you're optimizing for a lot of things and fuel efficiency would be one of them.

953
00:57:48.830 --> 00:57:53.030
Um,
but you're also flying the segment that's the easiest to navigate.

954
00:57:53.420 --> 00:57:58.340
So by navigate,
we mean predict,
control an estimate.

955
00:57:58.720 --> 00:58:02.750
Uh,
and so when we're,
uh,
was that as a chemical spacecraft,

956
00:58:02.751 --> 00:58:07.751
so it's not like I am propulsion so it's not firing it's engines continuously.

957
00:58:08.570 --> 00:58:12.590
So with the line segments you basically get to the end,
you orient and you fire,

958
00:58:12.910 --> 00:58:15.920
then you do a correction burn and then you don't fire until the other end of the

959
00:58:15.921 --> 00:58:16.754
line segment.

960
00:58:17.240 --> 00:58:22.240
So flying a continuous curve might be better for some reasons including viewing

961
00:58:25.551 --> 00:58:30.290
geometry,
but it would be a lot more stress on the navigators.
Thanks.

962
00:58:30.320 --> 00:58:35.060
So also you'd have to be very careful because as I said,

963
00:58:35.061 --> 00:58:38.420
they try and fly to slice the solar panels through the coma,

964
00:58:38.450 --> 00:58:41.510
particularly when we were married helion and August,

965
00:58:41.510 --> 00:58:46.160
2015 so doing that.
Exactly.
Um,

966
00:58:46.250 --> 00:58:48.790
would be exciting,
let's say.
Uh,

967
00:58:48.830 --> 00:58:52.690
cause it would depend on the accuracy of your coma model,
um,

968
00:58:53.260 --> 00:58:55.700
cause you'd be continuously varying the Delta v direction.

969
00:58:56.450 --> 00:59:00.350
So I would say that I'm not disagreeing with anything you're saying,

970
00:59:00.380 --> 00:59:01.880
but there are a lot of constraints there.

971
00:59:02.780 --> 00:59:06.830
<v 6>You know,
did the interstellar mission,
you mentioned the software that runs that,</v>

972
00:59:07.150 --> 00:59:09.110
I've taught them mostly what you don't like.

973
00:59:09.140 --> 00:59:13.190
What would be that major modules or building blocks of something like that.

974
00:59:13.620 --> 00:59:18.510
<v 1>Wow.
Okay.
Really putting me on the spot here.
Um,
I'm not sure we know,</v>

975
00:59:19.670 --> 00:59:24.020
uh,
there are advocates who say,
well,
okay,

976
00:59:24.021 --> 00:59:27.950
that has to be some kind of very general evolving,
you know,

977
00:59:27.980 --> 00:59:30.500
spacecraft evolving software and whatever.

978
00:59:31.720 --> 00:59:35.840
I don't know how you guys feel here at Google,
but at least for me,
I'm like,
yeah,

979
00:59:35.930 --> 00:59:40.850
not quite yet.
They're in comfortable with that because we're talking about,

980
00:59:40.851 --> 00:59:44.390
you know,
like a many trillions of dollars,
you know,
probably to,

981
00:59:44.800 --> 00:59:48.100
to conduct such a mission like that.
Um,
so you want to,

982
00:59:48.260 --> 00:59:52.610
you want to have quite a bit of confidence that it's going to work.

983
00:59:53.240 --> 00:59:53.690
Um,

984
00:59:53.690 --> 00:59:58.690
so I would focus more on traditional software,

985
00:59:59.150 --> 01:00:03.770
but really the question is when you get there,
you have so many open choices,

986
01:00:04.370 --> 01:00:05.810
what are the planets look like?

987
01:00:05.960 --> 01:00:10.100
Which plan is do you go see first knowing full well that when you entered orbit

988
01:00:10.101 --> 01:00:11.030
around one planet,

989
01:00:11.090 --> 01:00:14.840
you have enough resources to then go visit another planet where it really to

990
01:00:14.841 --> 01:00:19.520
look at it in context,
you know,
you got to orbit it flying by is,

991
01:00:19.521 --> 01:00:23.450
you know,
just enough to get you really curious.
Right?

992
01:00:23.750 --> 01:00:26.090
So to make an analogy to Rosetta,

993
01:00:26.210 --> 01:00:29.800
the reason why there were all these misconceptions about comments is they've

994
01:00:29.801 --> 01:00:31.370
flown by the call,

995
01:00:31.371 --> 01:00:35.000
this the golden era of comment missions because depending on how you count,

996
01:00:35.001 --> 01:00:38.690
there's been,
you know,
half a dozen to maybe even 10 comment missions.

997
01:00:38.691 --> 01:00:40.820
But those are all flybys of like a day or two.

998
01:00:41.450 --> 01:00:46.310
This was two years at this comment.
Completely different ballgame.

999
01:00:46.610 --> 01:00:50.140
So when you get to this other solar system,
uh,

1000
01:00:50.360 --> 01:00:51.920
to me I would set the bar low.

1001
01:00:51.950 --> 01:00:56.950
I would say the smart software has to just do better than the dumb software

1002
01:00:57.351 --> 01:01:02.210
alternative.
So it has to pick a planet,
get to orbit around it,
map it,

1003
01:01:02.420 --> 01:01:06.050
search for signs of life,
look for different virus signatures.

1004
01:01:06.440 --> 01:01:09.620
But there's even quite a bit of controversy about what those signs of life would

1005
01:01:09.621 --> 01:01:11.780
be.
Right.
I mean,

1006
01:01:11.810 --> 01:01:14.750
I welcome any inputs from any of you guys.

1007
01:01:14.751 --> 01:01:18.050
If you got to a planet and you knew nothing about it,
what would you look for?

1008
01:01:19.390 --> 01:01:20.510
It's a really hard question.

1009
01:01:21.670 --> 01:01:25.370
<v 7>So does any of the Ai software have a uh,</v>

1010
01:01:25.570 --> 01:01:28.060
Theresa its heritage back to the remote agent?

1011
01:01:29.870 --> 01:01:32.210
<v 1>I would say not directly.
Um,</v>

1012
01:01:32.390 --> 01:01:36.830
but certainly the remote agent was the first time that,
you know,

1013
01:01:36.831 --> 01:01:38.600
we were able to fly a planner.

1014
01:01:38.870 --> 01:01:43.700
I would say the fact that there's a planner and exact onboard is similar.

1015
01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:48.230
So it's still in this generic view of like a three layer architecture.

1016
01:01:48.680 --> 01:01:52.710
Uh,
but the individual things have changed a lot.
So,
uh,

1017
01:01:52.760 --> 01:01:56.360
the planning that we use as much more incremental planning and not batch

1018
01:01:56.361 --> 01:01:59.540
planning.
And then when we talk about flight software,

1019
01:01:59.541 --> 01:02:02.990
which is a more direct comparison,
uh,
to,
you know,

1020
01:02:02.991 --> 01:02:05.450
remote agent because remote remote Asian was flight software,

1021
01:02:05.451 --> 01:02:09.860
not ground software.
Uh,
I would say the main differences is our,

1022
01:02:09.861 --> 01:02:13.070
that we now emphasize being very close to the science.

1023
01:02:13.310 --> 01:02:18.310
So a very big part of that timeline that I showed you a is that we have all

1024
01:02:19.621 --> 01:02:22.530
kinds of image processing,
software clustering software,

1025
01:02:22.800 --> 01:02:26.190
very detailed instrument analysis,
software for spectral and mixing.

1026
01:02:26.191 --> 01:02:28.050
If you guys are familiar with remote sensing,

1027
01:02:28.350 --> 01:02:32.910
so it's figuring out the constituency of the individual elements that you're

1028
01:02:32.940 --> 01:02:35.310
looking at from the spectral lines.

1029
01:02:35.820 --> 01:02:38.910
All those things are now very much what we do.

1030
01:02:39.480 --> 01:02:41.400
Please join me in thanking [inaudible] Steve

1031
01:02:44.550 --> 01:02:45.990
<v 0>[inaudible].</v>
