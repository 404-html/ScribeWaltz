1
00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:08.860
Good morning.
Welcome to toxic Google.
Uh,

2
00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.260
we're very fortunate today to have with us,
Dr Jeffrey Kirschner,
uh,

3
00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.050
to speak with us about,
uh,

4
00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:19.110
the biotechnical biotechnological assault on Alzheimer's disease.

5
00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:23.520
Uh,
like for so many of you.
Uh,
this is,

6
00:00:23.521 --> 00:00:28.470
this is something very personal to,
to me and,
and,
uh,
uh,

7
00:00:28.471 --> 00:00:32.520
and to so many others.
Uh,
my mother,
uh,
had seven children,

8
00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:34.410
a and a,

9
00:00:34.411 --> 00:00:38.700
and went through a divorce and finally decided to get her college degree at the

10
00:00:38.701 --> 00:00:39.534
age of 40.

11
00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.460
She got her bachelors of science and nursing went on to get her master's degree

12
00:00:44.461 --> 00:00:48.710
and then her Phd and taught at the university level.
Uh,

13
00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.500
and then unfortunately in the course of her teachings was struck by this,
uh,

14
00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.140
by this disease.
Uh,
and it's something that there's not much we can do about.

15
00:00:58.620 --> 00:00:59.453
Um,

16
00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.630
it's one of the reasons why you joined the board of directors at the Alzheimer's

17
00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:08.340
Association,
uh,
and,
and colleagues with Jeff Jeffrey on that board.
Um,

18
00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:11.850
but this is something that we really need to put a lot of effort behind.

19
00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:16.900
And a doctor Kershner was here today to talk to us about what is going on,
uh,

20
00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.000
with the therapies associated with this disease.
So a doctor,

21
00:01:21.001 --> 00:01:25.890
Kris Kirschner is a senior medical director at Genentech and adjunct clinical

22
00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.100
associate professor of neurology and neurological sciences at Stanford

23
00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.010
University School of Medicine.
Uh,

24
00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.260
he designs that oversees clinical trials of novel therapies for Alzheimer's

25
00:01:37.261 --> 00:01:41.970
Disease and other neuro degenerative illnesses.
Uh,

26
00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.440
while also maintaining an active clinical practice at an academic memory clinic.

27
00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:50.910
He was also on the board of directors at the Alzheimer's Association of Northern

28
00:01:50.911 --> 00:01:52.410
California and Northern Nevada.

29
00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.170
He graduated from Harvard College and received his MD and phd degrees from

30
00:01:58.171 --> 00:02:00.510
Washington University in St Louis.

31
00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:02.970
And so please help me welcome Dr Jeffrey Kirschner.

32
00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:13.020
Great.
Thanks very much Andrew,
and thanks to all of you for coming this morning.

33
00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.390
Um,
so one of the things that I have the great pleasure of being able to continue

34
00:02:18.391 --> 00:02:22.170
doing,
um,
despite my,
uh,
kind of two different day jobs,

35
00:02:22.171 --> 00:02:26.970
one at Genentech and one at Stanford,
um,
is I get to continue to see patients.
Um,

36
00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:28.350
and,
uh,

37
00:02:28.351 --> 00:02:33.351
one a woman whom I saw a fairly recently is a 67 year old woman whose husband

38
00:02:35.071 --> 00:02:40.020
died a few years ago.
She lives in Palo Alto by herself and in the family house.

39
00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:45.180
Um,
her daughter,
uh,
lives,
has kind of moved on to Manhattan,

40
00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:49.800
so lives in New York,
talks with her mom frequently,
um,
by telephone.

41
00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:53.280
Um,
but,
uh,
you know,
her mom's kind of on her own out here.

42
00:02:53.281 --> 00:02:55.710
She's gotten used to being alone.

43
00:02:55.711 --> 00:02:59.250
She's got her nice happy life here in Palo Alto,
you know,

44
00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:01.720
speaks with her daughter
by telephone complaints to her.

45
00:03:01.721 --> 00:03:04.380
Why don't you come visit me more often.
Um,

46
00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:07.330
and so in the midst of one of these complaining episodes are fine.

47
00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:10.570
Her daughter says,
fine,
you know,
let's,
I'll,
I'll schedule a visit.

48
00:03:10.571 --> 00:03:13.450
Let's come out and see you.
Um,
and so they,

49
00:03:13.451 --> 00:03:18.120
they planned this wonderful weekend together so her daughter arrives.
Um,

50
00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:23.200
uh,
I think it was on a,
on a Friday evening on a flight from New York.
Um,

51
00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.870
sees her,
uh,
you know,

52
00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:28.930
greets her mom in the evening when she gets to the house.

53
00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.300
They have a nice long conversation.

54
00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:36.630
Mom tells her about this great a farmer's market that's open on a Saturday

55
00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:41.650
morning.
Um,
uh,
in,
in Palo Alto.
We're a,

56
00:03:41.651 --> 00:03:45.390
apparently you can get like some nice brunch food.
And so they,
uh,
they,

57
00:03:45.391 --> 00:03:48.250
they make this plan.
Tomorrow morning we're going to get up early,

58
00:03:48.251 --> 00:03:51.490
go to the farmer's market,
we're going to have a nice brunch there.

59
00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:54.010
Time to go to sleep.

60
00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:59.620
Daughter wakes up in the morning fairly early.
She feels,
um,

61
00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:04.470
looks around the house.
Mom is nowhere to be found.

62
00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:08.010
She gets a little bit panicked.
I mean,
she gets out,
goes,
you know,

63
00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:10.470
that looks like the car's gone actually.

64
00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:12.660
Where in the world could her mom have gone?

65
00:04:12.661 --> 00:04:16.560
Her mom hasn't sort of joined the cell phone revolution and so she doesn't have

66
00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:20.140
a,
the daughter doesn't have any way to contact her.
Um,

67
00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:24.000
a little while later around 11 o'clock in the morning,
finally,
you know,

68
00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:28.500
daughters in distress.
Where did mom go?
Um,
11 o'clock in the morning.

69
00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:32.310
Uh,
her mom pulls up in the driveway,
gets out of the car.

70
00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:35.850
The daughter comes outside script mom,
where have you been?
You know,

71
00:04:35.851 --> 00:04:39.360
we were going to go out to the farmer's market this morning and her mom turns

72
00:04:39.361 --> 00:04:41.730
her since,
oh honey,
when did you arrive

73
00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:48.180
on the telephone?
Over the past few months.
Um,
you know,

74
00:04:48.181 --> 00:04:52.230
in retrospect now this is the daughter telling me this story in clinic with her

75
00:04:52.231 --> 00:04:56.700
mother sitting next to her,
her mother having,
you know,
just some,
you know,

76
00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:00.840
kind of,
you know,
makes excuses for how this could have happened.

77
00:05:00.841 --> 00:05:03.710
And it's not such a big deal in her mother's eyes.
Um,

78
00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:08.040
but the daughter in retrospect kind of looks over the past several months.
Um,

79
00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:10.140
and yeah,
mom has been a little bit forgetful,

80
00:05:10.141 --> 00:05:13.950
maybe hasn't been so aware of like what the date is and things like that.

81
00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:18.600
Her daughter kind of been brushing it off,
but this event really,
um,
you know,

82
00:05:18.601 --> 00:05:22.470
was different and really stood out in her daughter's mind is being,
you know,

83
00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:26.190
something that's clearly abnormal.
So this is why they came to see me in clinic.

84
00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:31.590
Um,
you know,
her mom's otherwise pretty functional.
She's maintains the household.

85
00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:35.850
I mean,
she's,
you know,
each three square meals a day.
She is,
she goes shopping,

86
00:05:35.851 --> 00:05:39.990
she's got her volunteer activities that she participates in.
She drives,

87
00:05:39.991 --> 00:05:44.400
she hasn't been in any accidents.
I mean she's,
she's functioning just fine.

88
00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:49.640
One of the challenges that we have as neurologist is when to sort of put the

89
00:05:50.401 --> 00:05:54.850
label of a disease on a patient like this.
Um,

90
00:05:55.320 --> 00:06:00.230
and Alzheimer's,
which is what we're here to talk about today.
Um,

91
00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:03.920
we've come to understand kind of spans a very wide spectrum.

92
00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:08.690
Alzheimer's disease actually starts in the brain years,
decades,

93
00:06:08.691 --> 00:06:12.560
probably before the first symptoms hit.
Um,

94
00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:16.550
and we'll talk a little bit about what those brain changes are.
Um,

95
00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:21.580
and so there's this some kind of dividing line between normal and what I'll call

96
00:06:21.651 --> 00:06:23.360
preclinical Alzheimer's disease,

97
00:06:23.361 --> 00:06:27.170
which is that stage of the disease where you've got the brain changes but you

98
00:06:27.171 --> 00:06:29.570
don't have any symptoms yet.
Um,

99
00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:34.520
and I think the field is very uncertain about where this line is between normal

100
00:06:34.521 --> 00:06:36.020
in preclinical disease.

101
00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:39.620
At some point you start to get mild symptoms.

102
00:06:39.621 --> 00:06:43.490
Maybe a doctor would call a patient,
um,
uh,

103
00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:47.300
say that a patient has mild cognitive impairment where maybe their scores on a

104
00:06:47.301 --> 00:06:51.260
memory test are now,
uh,
abnormal.
In fact,
this woman,

105
00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:56.180
I subjected her to a memory test and in fact she scored abnormally on it,

106
00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:59.690
but you know,
asking her every question you can think about,

107
00:06:59.691 --> 00:07:02.960
about daily function and she's just fine.

108
00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:05.960
There's nothing that she's missing in terms of daily function.

109
00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:09.770
We call that prodromal Alzheimer's disease.
When you have,
you know,

110
00:07:09.771 --> 00:07:14.760
some memory test abnormalities but you're able to hold it together.
Um,

111
00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:19.880
and this thing that we call dementia is the very end stage of the disease.

112
00:07:19.881 --> 00:07:24.590
And this is where you now need help from outside people in order to get by day

113
00:07:24.591 --> 00:07:27.470
to day,
you can no longer work.
Um,

114
00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:30.010
you might need help balancing the checkbook,
uh,

115
00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:33.540
or just maintaining the house.
Um,

116
00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:38.360
so we regard this as being kind of the end stage of the illness and you can

117
00:07:38.361 --> 00:07:41.810
imagine that there's a lot of people out there who need help with balancing

118
00:07:41.811 --> 00:07:45.950
their checkbook and,
um,
sort of maintaining their calendar and so forth.

119
00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:51.260
Um,
and there was a day where we sort of thought that,
um,

120
00:07:51.410 --> 00:07:52.700
you know,
when you get old,

121
00:07:52.730 --> 00:07:55.310
it's natural that you lose the ability to do these things,

122
00:07:55.311 --> 00:07:57.710
but that's not what the medical profession now believes.

123
00:07:57.711 --> 00:08:01.010
We don't think that losing the ability to maintain your calendar or your

124
00:08:01.011 --> 00:08:04.580
checkbook is part of the normal process of aging.

125
00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:06.170
That is an illness.

126
00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:13.220
The statistics are pretty striking.
So the Alzheimer's Association,
um,
is,

127
00:08:13.221 --> 00:08:17.840
uh,
uh,
uh,
folks from our local chapter here with me today.
Um,

128
00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:22.520
and,
uh,
they are the leading advocacy group for,
um,

129
00:08:22.610 --> 00:08:27.420
for patients with the disease.
Um,
and every year they assemble,
uh,

130
00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:29.540
statistics and these statistics are staggering.

131
00:08:29.541 --> 00:08:32.690
These are the latest 2017 numbers.
So,
you know,

132
00:08:32.691 --> 00:08:35.540
more than 5 million Americans,
um,

133
00:08:35.810 --> 00:08:39.650
more people die of Alzheimer's disease than have breast cancer and prostate

134
00:08:39.651 --> 00:08:41.520
cancer combined.
Um,

135
00:08:41.570 --> 00:08:46.370
it costs an enormous amount of money when you take into account not just the,
uh,

136
00:08:46.371 --> 00:08:50.840
the costs of caring for the patients and housing patients who need all this

137
00:08:50.841 --> 00:08:52.160
extra help.
But also,

138
00:08:52.610 --> 00:08:57.330
what about all those unpaid hours work that,
um,
that,
uh,

139
00:08:57.390 --> 00:09:02.390
spouses and adult children have to put in for taking care of these patients?

140
00:09:02.910 --> 00:09:04.770
So this is an enormous illness.
In fact,

141
00:09:04.771 --> 00:09:09.330
I think that this is the greatest health challenge of our generation.

142
00:09:09.730 --> 00:09:14.010
Um,
in many ways we've gotten on top of things like heart disease and cancer.

143
00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:15.480
Neither of those is cured,

144
00:09:15.481 --> 00:09:19.740
but they're well managed now and we have a good understanding of what the risks

145
00:09:19.741 --> 00:09:24.570
are and to how to keep people alive without heart attacks and,
and,
uh,

146
00:09:24.990 --> 00:09:28.640
uh,
and,
uh,
in,
in cancer.
Um,

147
00:09:29.070 --> 00:09:33.960
but Alzheimer's disease is the one disease that doesn't have any treatment

148
00:09:33.961 --> 00:09:38.860
available that can stop or even slow the disease.
We really have nothing.
So,

149
00:09:38.910 --> 00:09:41.850
you know,
I,
I attend this clinic and I take care of patients,

150
00:09:41.851 --> 00:09:46.560
like the one I said in a lot of what I do is just educating them on what the

151
00:09:46.561 --> 00:09:51.140
illness is.
But I don't do a lot of treating because we really don't have,
uh,

152
00:09:51.510 --> 00:09:55.800
any effective treatments to offer.
So what are the symptoms?

153
00:09:55.801 --> 00:10:00.600
So just like this patient,
uh,
the inability to,

154
00:10:00.630 --> 00:10:03.750
um,
uh,
kind of remember things that just happened.

155
00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:08.750
The inability to form new memories is sort of at the core of how this disease

156
00:10:09.121 --> 00:10:10.680
starts in most people.

157
00:10:10.830 --> 00:10:13.560
And this relates to a structure in the brain called the hippocampus.

158
00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:17.700
This is where new memories are formed and it is the first place in the brain to

159
00:10:17.701 --> 00:10:21.120
get the a distinctive changes of Alzheimer's disease at,

160
00:10:21.121 --> 00:10:23.520
I'll tell you about in a moment.
Um,

161
00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:29.160
these brain changes do spread to affect other parts of the brain.

162
00:10:29.161 --> 00:10:33.600
And so therefore other cognitive functions like a language function,

163
00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:37.020
visual,
spacial function and executive function.

164
00:10:37.050 --> 00:10:41.850
All of these different so called cognitive domains end up getting affected as

165
00:10:41.851 --> 00:10:44.610
the disease progresses over time.
Um,

166
00:10:45.570 --> 00:10:50.570
now I do in my clinic get confronted with patients who come to me and save for

167
00:10:50.941 --> 00:10:54.020
30 years.
Doctor,
I've not been able to,
uh,

168
00:10:54.060 --> 00:10:57.840
remember the names of people that's not a disease.
Um,

169
00:10:57.960 --> 00:11:00.870
I have trouble remembering people's names too.
Um,

170
00:11:00.871 --> 00:11:04.860
so there's a lot of people who are,
you know,
worried about,
uh,
you know,

171
00:11:05.370 --> 00:11:09.360
what they perceive in themselves to be cognitive weaknesses that doesn't

172
00:11:09.361 --> 00:11:12.720
necessarily constitute,
uh,
in,
in illness.
Um,

173
00:11:12.750 --> 00:11:16.080
what gets my attention is when somebody tells me about symptoms that have

174
00:11:16.081 --> 00:11:20.820
changed over time,
especially over the past year or two.
Um,
that's,

175
00:11:20.850 --> 00:11:24.600
that's what gets my attention.
So what is Alzheimer's disease?

176
00:11:24.601 --> 00:11:28.410
It's actually defined by what your brain looks like in the microscope after

177
00:11:28.411 --> 00:11:32.550
death.
So there's these characteristic changes of plaques and tangles.

178
00:11:32.970 --> 00:11:33.540
Um,

179
00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:38.250
these plaques are made up of a protein that we came to discover is called the

180
00:11:38.251 --> 00:11:39.600
Beta amyloid protein.

181
00:11:40.530 --> 00:11:43.530
So these plaques are in the gray matter.

182
00:11:43.531 --> 00:11:48.420
It's in that exterior mantle around the outside of the brain,
um,

183
00:11:48.660 --> 00:11:53.070
uh,
kind of sitting there between neurons.
It's the spheres of an aggregated,

184
00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:57.940
um,
and there's a bunch of cells,
inflammatory cells kind of surrounding it,

185
00:11:57.941 --> 00:12:02.470
but it's made up mainly just have this one protein separately kind of

186
00:12:02.471 --> 00:12:04.030
surrounding these plaques.

187
00:12:04.030 --> 00:12:07.960
And also in other areas of the brain that don't have plaques.
Um,

188
00:12:08.020 --> 00:12:10.960
there are these other structured called tangles.

189
00:12:10.961 --> 00:12:15.640
Tangles are an accumulation of a completely different protein called the tau

190
00:12:15.641 --> 00:12:20.440
protein.
Um,
and,
uh,
it aggregates inside of neurons,

191
00:12:20.470 --> 00:12:23.680
whereas plaques are outside of neurons.
Um,

192
00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:29.040
so how these proteins come to be aggregated and what exactly the aggregation of

193
00:12:29.921 --> 00:12:34.540
these proteins has to do with cell death is still a bit of a mystery.
Um,

194
00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:37.960
but,
uh,
you know,
it's been about a hundred years,

195
00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:40.180
111 years to be exact,

196
00:12:40.510 --> 00:12:44.290
that we've understood that this is what the brain looks like in,
in the patient.

197
00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:48.880
Uh,
in a patient with Alzheimer's disease.
Um,
it was in 1906,

198
00:12:48.881 --> 00:12:53.680
the dollar was Alzheimer,
uh,
who's a German pathologist.
Um,
uh,

199
00:12:54.060 --> 00:12:58.780
uh,
finally at a conference,
presented the findings from a patient,

200
00:12:58.781 --> 00:13:00.850
I'll gust dieter that he'd been,
uh,

201
00:13:01.210 --> 00:13:05.660
basically obsessed with for a number of years.
He met this patient,
um,

202
00:13:05.710 --> 00:13:10.500
in an insane asylum and Frankford.
Um,
she,
uh,
you know,

203
00:13:10.510 --> 00:13:15.310
had a number of,
uh,
strange symptoms including memory loss,
um,

204
00:13:15.340 --> 00:13:18.370
that fascinated him.
She was only 51 years old.

205
00:13:18.371 --> 00:13:23.371
She actually had a rare kind of Alzheimer's disease that you get as a

206
00:13:23.530 --> 00:13:24.161
genetically.

207
00:13:24.161 --> 00:13:28.600
So she directly inherited a gene for this disease from one of her parents.

208
00:13:29.130 --> 00:13:31.960
Um,
this is an uncommon way to get Alzheimer's disease,

209
00:13:31.961 --> 00:13:34.990
but it is a way to get Alzheimer's disease at age 51.

210
00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:37.180
So he became obsessed with this patient,

211
00:13:37.510 --> 00:13:41.480
found a way to basically be her pathologist at death,
and he,

212
00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:42.760
it's kind of macabre,

213
00:13:42.761 --> 00:13:45.670
but he was sort of waiting for this woman to die because he couldn't wait to

214
00:13:45.671 --> 00:13:48.010
look at her brain.
And this is what he found.

215
00:13:48.011 --> 00:13:50.620
He was the first one to describe these plaques and tangles.

216
00:13:50.890 --> 00:13:55.660
So at this psychiatric conference in 1906,
um,
he presented this paper,

217
00:13:55.950 --> 00:13:58.990
um,
he was largely ignored at the time.
Um,

218
00:13:59.050 --> 00:14:02.800
the story is that the talk that came right after him was on compulsive

219
00:14:02.801 --> 00:14:07.801
masturbation and everybody in the audience was there to witness that next talk

220
00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:12.430
and they were eager for Alzheimer to get off the stage so that,
um,
so that,

221
00:14:12.431 --> 00:14:16.780
that next speaker could come on.
Um,
so his findings were,
you know,

222
00:14:16.810 --> 00:14:19.900
largely ignored for quite a number of years.

223
00:14:19.901 --> 00:14:24.380
And for most of the 20th century,
we thought that Alzheimer's disease was,
um,

224
00:14:24.610 --> 00:14:26.470
a rare disease of young people.

225
00:14:28.150 --> 00:14:32.200
And it's because nobody did autopsies on grandma.
All right?

226
00:14:32.201 --> 00:14:35.360
We always thought that,
um,
old people,
uh,

227
00:14:35.530 --> 00:14:39.170
have memory loss and that's just a normal part of aging.
Um,

228
00:14:39.490 --> 00:14:43.930
but it was in the 60s and seventies kind of,
you know,
after the war that,

229
00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:44.793
um,

230
00:14:45.190 --> 00:14:49.060
people started doing more autopsies and kind of came to this realization that,

231
00:14:49.540 --> 00:14:52.310
uh,
instead of being a rare of young people,

232
00:14:52.311 --> 00:14:55.940
it's actually an extremely common disease of old people.

233
00:14:57.140 --> 00:14:59.000
And it was in 1985,
you know,

234
00:14:59.001 --> 00:15:03.140
as kind of the interest in Alzheimer's disease in the scientific community was

235
00:15:03.141 --> 00:15:05.390
starting to,
uh,
to rise,

236
00:15:05.391 --> 00:15:09.500
that finally somebody discovered that,
um,
uh,

237
00:15:09.530 --> 00:15:12.980
the protein that was in these plaques cause these plaques were just spots on the

238
00:15:12.981 --> 00:15:16.730
brain and nobody knew kind of what they were made up of.
Um,

239
00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:21.410
this was when this a Beta protein was,
uh,
this amyloid protein was,
uh,

240
00:15:21.411 --> 00:15:25.190
was discovered as the main ingredient in these amyloid plaques.

241
00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:27.530
And after this to,

242
00:15:27.540 --> 00:15:31.970
so this was a seminal discovery in 1985 and following that,

243
00:15:31.971 --> 00:15:34.100
there was an explosion in the scientific literature.

244
00:15:34.101 --> 00:15:38.780
This was at a time when we were starting to do protein biochemistry and cell

245
00:15:38.781 --> 00:15:42.920
biology and,
and you know,
kind of the tools that,
um,
uh,

246
00:15:42.921 --> 00:15:47.900
that biologist use to characterize proteins and pathways and so forth where,

247
00:15:48.250 --> 00:15:52.420
uh,
we're now blossoming.
And so this whole,
um,
you know,

248
00:15:52.430 --> 00:15:57.170
understanding of what the,
a Beta protein is kind of came to light in the,

249
00:15:57.171 --> 00:15:59.240
in the late eighties and early nineties,

250
00:15:59.630 --> 00:16:03.890
we understood that this a Beta protein was actually a sub component of a larger

251
00:16:03.891 --> 00:16:07.940
protein that,
uh,
came to be called amyloid precursor protein,

252
00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.820
not a very creative name.
Um,

253
00:16:11.090 --> 00:16:14.930
and we came to understand that some cleavage events.
So,

254
00:16:14.990 --> 00:16:19.460
so that amyloid precursor protein gets cut at two different places in order to

255
00:16:19.461 --> 00:16:23.720
liberate this short a string of amino acids that is the,

256
00:16:23.721 --> 00:16:27.370
a Beta peptide.
And that for,
you know,

257
00:16:27.380 --> 00:16:30.980
probably reasons that are just kind of random and having to do with the

258
00:16:30.981 --> 00:16:34.070
biochemical nature of this little a Beta peptide.

259
00:16:34.071 --> 00:16:38.030
It tends to be a little oily.
It tends to stick to itself.

260
00:16:38.590 --> 00:16:43.220
Um,
it tends to just glum up in these big,
uh,
uh,

261
00:16:43.250 --> 00:16:44.900
globs that you see here.

262
00:16:45.230 --> 00:16:49.700
The plaques are actually win a hundreds of thousands or millions of these

263
00:16:49.701 --> 00:16:54.500
molecules have a Beta all get glommed together in this really dense,
um,

264
00:16:54.830 --> 00:16:59.300
insoluble,
a blob that the brain just doesn't know what to do with.

265
00:17:01.490 --> 00:17:02.810
And you know,

266
00:17:02.811 --> 00:17:07.370
the discovery of all these pathways ended up leading to the postulation of the

267
00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:09.050
amyloid hypothesis,

268
00:17:09.051 --> 00:17:13.550
which is this statement that Beta amyloid accumulation is the primary cause of

269
00:17:13.551 --> 00:17:17.240
Alzheimer's disease.
What was,
and this was revolutionary in the field.

270
00:17:18.070 --> 00:17:21.770
And what was the evidence behind this?
Well,
first you could take it.

271
00:17:21.790 --> 00:17:25.040
So now in the laboratory,
people took this,
a Beta protein,

272
00:17:25.430 --> 00:17:30.290
dumped it onto cultured cells or a squirted it into the brain of mice.

273
00:17:30.291 --> 00:17:34.640
And in fact it could induce neuro toxicity.
So this protein could kill neurons.

274
00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:38.730
All right,
so that makes sense.
That's supportive evidence that,
that,

275
00:17:38.731 --> 00:17:41.840
that amyloid is bad for you.
Um,

276
00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:46.960
probably most compelling was science was a genetic evidence of the importance of

277
00:17:47.031 --> 00:17:47.511
a Beta.

278
00:17:47.511 --> 00:17:52.511
So remember I told you that that a patient from 1906 that that Alzheimer had

279
00:17:52.561 --> 00:17:56.520
examined,
she had a familial form of the disease.
So,
uh,

280
00:17:56.521 --> 00:18:00.900
it turns out that she had a,
a point mutation,
just a single,
um,

281
00:18:01.350 --> 00:18:06.210
uh,
uh,
uh,
element or for DNA was changed,
um,

282
00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:09.060
in a protein that,
uh,
uh,

283
00:18:09.750 --> 00:18:13.950
that mediates one of those cleavage events and the amyloid precursor protein to

284
00:18:13.951 --> 00:18:18.060
liberate a Beta,
it makes that protein,
it makes that enzyme work too much.

285
00:18:18.420 --> 00:18:22.080
So basically it leads to an overproduction of the,
a Beta protein

286
00:18:23.670 --> 00:18:27.370
and other piece of genetic evidence.
We came to discover that,
uh,

287
00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:31.860
individuals with down syndrome,
down syndrome.
What is that?

288
00:18:31.861 --> 00:18:33.300
That's trisomy 21.

289
00:18:33.301 --> 00:18:37.830
That's where you accidentally get three copies of chromosome 21 instead of the

290
00:18:37.831 --> 00:18:42.831
usual two copies guests where the amyloid precursor protein gene lives.

291
00:18:45.060 --> 00:18:50.060
It lives on chromosome 21 and it turns out that individuals with down syndrome,

292
00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:56.100
if they managed to live to the age of 40 or so and don't die of heart disease or

293
00:18:56.101 --> 00:19:01.050
have other complications of their genetic syndrome,
um,
they,
uh,

294
00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:05.850
we'll have a 100% chance of getting Alzheimer's disease.
All right.

295
00:19:05.851 --> 00:19:09.990
So their brain shows the exact same changes as um,
uh,

296
00:19:09.991 --> 00:19:14.340
the patient that Alzheimer's took care of.
And the same changes that you know,

297
00:19:14.430 --> 00:19:19.200
that all of our,
uh,
older demented patients have.
Um,

298
00:19:19.201 --> 00:19:21.780
so this genetic evidence is really compelling.

299
00:19:21.930 --> 00:19:26.040
So just single genetic changes that lead to an overproduction of this one

300
00:19:26.041 --> 00:19:28.950
protein or sufficient to cause Alzheimer's disease.

301
00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:34.110
And so scientists really,
you know,
got excited about this amyloid hypothesis and,

302
00:19:34.111 --> 00:19:38.310
and now we think we're on a pathway towards curing the disease.

303
00:19:38.311 --> 00:19:43.140
Cause now we have the causative protein in the brain,
right?
Um,

304
00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:45.780
evidence.
Kate,
you know,
we,
um,

305
00:19:46.110 --> 00:19:50.070
sort of assembled this picture of how Alzheimer's Disease Starts,
that,
you know,

306
00:19:50.071 --> 00:19:52.060
the,
the amyloid,
uh,

307
00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:56.220
a hypothesis postulates that a Beta is front and center,

308
00:19:56.460 --> 00:20:01.460
that accumulation of amyloid Beta starts when we're healthy and probably reaches

309
00:20:02.791 --> 00:20:07.140
a near maximal level.
Uh,
by the time patients like this,

310
00:20:07.220 --> 00:20:10.440
a 67 year old woman that I told you about comes to my clinic,

311
00:20:10.441 --> 00:20:14.790
probably the level of a Beta and her brain was more or less maximal,

312
00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:19.680
um,
at that time point.
Um,
and it,
it persists,
you know,

313
00:20:19.681 --> 00:20:22.530
through the prodromal and dementia stages of the disease.

314
00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:26.490
Downstream of that is the accumulation of that tau protein.

315
00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:31.050
Remember I told you about the tangles that you see in the brain and eventually

316
00:20:31.051 --> 00:20:36.051
that leads to neurodegeneration and symptoms are the last thing that happened.

317
00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:42.870
Um,
couple of important things to notice from this graph.
One is,

318
00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:43.350
uh,

319
00:20:43.350 --> 00:20:47.650
sort of the optimistic view of this graph has look how resilient the brain is.

320
00:20:47.950 --> 00:20:52.950
It can withstand a lot of amyloid plaques and a lot of Tau tangles before a

321
00:20:53.711 --> 00:20:56.230
patient exhibits the first symptom.
Okay.

322
00:20:56.231 --> 00:21:01.030
So symptoms are long delayed in time from the accumulation of the damage in the

323
00:21:01.031 --> 00:21:02.290
brain.
Um,

324
00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:05.890
the downside of this is that by the time of patient shows up in my clinic,

325
00:21:05.891 --> 00:21:10.600
the brain sort of looks like a war zone.
Um,
and uh,
you know,

326
00:21:10.601 --> 00:21:14.620
this might make it a little bit complicated to start treating the disease at the

327
00:21:14.621 --> 00:21:18.220
point that somebody has symptoms.
So bear that in mind.

328
00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:20.170
So again,

329
00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:25.200
amyloid hypothesis here we are now in the 1990s and everybody in the scientific

330
00:21:25.241 --> 00:21:30.160
field is super excited about the amyloid hypothesis and now drug companies.
Now.

331
00:21:30.161 --> 00:21:32.920
So now we're getting to the biotechnology part of the talk.

332
00:21:33.130 --> 00:21:35.890
Drug companies are starting to glom on to this and say,
Hey,

333
00:21:35.891 --> 00:21:40.150
we've got a goldmine here.
We need to develop drugs against this amyloid protein.

334
00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:43.720
It turns out that it's not so easy to create,
you know,

335
00:21:43.721 --> 00:21:46.300
the kind of drugs that you put into a pill,
right?

336
00:21:46.301 --> 00:21:51.301
Small molecules that you can take as a pill and somehow do something to this

337
00:21:51.731 --> 00:21:55.890
amyloid protein to neutralize it.
That turns out to be not so straight forward.

338
00:21:56.520 --> 00:22:01.510
Um,
but scientists like Dale Shank had this idea.
Um,
you know,

339
00:22:01.540 --> 00:22:04.030
if,
if the problem is a protein,

340
00:22:05.020 --> 00:22:09.940
we have this whole apparatus in our body to deal with bad proteins.

341
00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:11.680
It's called the immune system.

342
00:22:12.370 --> 00:22:16.090
What the immune system does is it recognizes bad proteins,
for instance,

343
00:22:16.091 --> 00:22:20.440
proteins that come from bacteria or virus as a protein that's recognized as

344
00:22:20.441 --> 00:22:21.280
being foreign.

345
00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:25.990
And the immune system goes crazy when it's confronted with a foreign protein and

346
00:22:25.991 --> 00:22:28.260
it has all these,
you know,
uh,

347
00:22:28.330 --> 00:22:33.070
advanced mechanisms to try to attack that foreign protein and to get rid of it

348
00:22:33.071 --> 00:22:37.300
and the most efficient manner possible.
So Dale Shank and others had the idea,

349
00:22:37.301 --> 00:22:40.180
why don't we hijack the immune system,

350
00:22:40.210 --> 00:22:45.210
train the immune system to think that a Beta is a foreign protein and we'll just

351
00:22:45.791 --> 00:22:49.720
let the immune system do the hard work of finding all that a Beta protein in the

352
00:22:49.721 --> 00:22:54.580
brain and get rid of it.
And so,
uh,
you know,
what he was able to achieve in mice,

353
00:22:54.760 --> 00:22:55.270
you know,

354
00:22:55.270 --> 00:22:59.170
scientists now in the mid nineties had created mouse models of Alzheimer's

355
00:22:59.171 --> 00:23:02.590
disease based on these,
uh,
human genetic cases.

356
00:23:02.591 --> 00:23:07.591
So you introduce in mice those same genetic mutations that humans,

357
00:23:07.740 --> 00:23:11.560
uh,
who have familial forms of Alzheimer's disease have.
And Lo and behold,

358
00:23:11.561 --> 00:23:16.480
these mice develop amyloid plaques in their brain and they get demented.
Um,

359
00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:20.410
and so what if you administer a vaccine to these mice?

360
00:23:20.411 --> 00:23:23.260
So a vaccine is a way of introducing a protein,

361
00:23:23.590 --> 00:23:28.000
kind of showing it off to the immune system with flags saying,
you know,

362
00:23:28.001 --> 00:23:32.650
foreign bad attack.
Um,
and,
uh,

363
00:23:32.890 --> 00:23:37.000
by giving a vaccine with this a Beta protein to mice,

364
00:23:37.001 --> 00:23:40.780
he was able to absolutely clear these amyloid plaques away.

365
00:23:41.080 --> 00:23:45.350
It was beautiful.
These mice,
not only did their brains look normal,

366
00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:48.380
but they also behave normally.
They did not get demented.

367
00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:53.960
And so this was in 1999 this paper was published in nature.
Uh,

368
00:23:54.260 --> 00:23:58.790
uh,
uh,
several biotechnology companies were already all over this.

369
00:23:58.820 --> 00:24:02.300
They had amyloid vaccine's ready to give to humans.

370
00:24:03.140 --> 00:24:07.460
And so,
uh,
that was actually being done in parallel.
So,

371
00:24:07.910 --> 00:24:11.720
um,
the first vaccines were given to a group of humans.

372
00:24:11.721 --> 00:24:16.721
The field was extremely excited and absolutely sure that this was going to be

373
00:24:16.821 --> 00:24:20.160
the cure for Alzheimer's disease.
That,
that,
um,

374
00:24:20.210 --> 00:24:23.450
this vaccine would do in humans exactly what it did in mice.

375
00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:26.420
Do you know what happened?
Unfortunately,

376
00:24:26.421 --> 00:24:30.710
about 6% of the people in these clinical trials got meningitis.

377
00:24:33.320 --> 00:24:35.540
Now how did that happen?
You know,
in retrospect,

378
00:24:35.541 --> 00:24:40.541
it shouldn't have been so much of a surprise because it turns out that patients

379
00:24:41.091 --> 00:24:43.190
with Alzheimer's disease have,
you know,

380
00:24:43.191 --> 00:24:46.160
such an abundance of this amyloid protein in their brain.

381
00:24:46.161 --> 00:24:50.300
I mean literally milligrams of it.
If you could purify it out of one human brain,

382
00:24:50.690 --> 00:24:55.690
there's so much of it there that if suddenly the immune system goes berserk over

383
00:24:55.971 --> 00:24:59.480
a protein that's in super high abundance within the brain,

384
00:24:59.810 --> 00:25:01.040
not surprisingly,

385
00:25:01.340 --> 00:25:06.200
you set off a pretty bad immune reaction and you can imagine that having a lot

386
00:25:06.201 --> 00:25:07.190
of inflammation,

387
00:25:07.191 --> 00:25:11.810
a lot of immune cells going berzerk around stuff that they think is foreign

388
00:25:11.811 --> 00:25:14.180
around the brain can cause problems.

389
00:25:14.450 --> 00:25:18.200
So they had to stop this clinical trial early because of safety.

390
00:25:18.230 --> 00:25:21.650
It was not safe to give people a vaccine.
Um,

391
00:25:21.950 --> 00:25:25.940
the problem with vaccine is that,
you know,
once your immune system is trained,

392
00:25:25.970 --> 00:25:27.890
you can't turn off the immune system.

393
00:25:28.130 --> 00:25:31.790
Aside from getting people strong chemotherapeutics or,
or something,

394
00:25:31.970 --> 00:25:36.770
you can't really stop the immune system from all this crazy attack of a beta.

395
00:25:38.240 --> 00:25:42.890
So this was pretty disappointing.
Um,
we followed these patients,

396
00:25:42.920 --> 00:25:46.140
um,
uh,
uh,
Ashley to death,
um,

397
00:25:46.250 --> 00:25:50.510
because we were so curious about did the vaccine at least,
you know,

398
00:25:50.511 --> 00:25:55.310
do something positive.
Unfortunately,
all of these patients,

399
00:25:55.340 --> 00:25:59.900
their dementia continued to worsen over time and there wasn't,
you know,

400
00:26:00.260 --> 00:26:04.130
uh,
the patients who received placebo or patients who got the active vaccine,

401
00:26:04.131 --> 00:26:07.070
there wasn't really any difference in how they're all timers.

402
00:26:07.071 --> 00:26:09.590
Disease progressed over time.
Um,

403
00:26:09.650 --> 00:26:14.330
a number of them ended up passing away and autopsies were done in the context of

404
00:26:14.331 --> 00:26:18.770
this research.
One interesting thing they found,
um,
um,

405
00:26:18.860 --> 00:26:22.220
you probably have a sense that when you get a vaccine,

406
00:26:22.221 --> 00:26:26.930
sometimes it takes and sometimes it doesn't or sometimes it takes a little bit,

407
00:26:27.170 --> 00:26:29.510
in other words,
your immune reaction against the vaccine.

408
00:26:29.540 --> 00:26:31.610
It can vary and you can actually measure this.

409
00:26:31.611 --> 00:26:35.480
You can measure the titer of an antibody response.

410
00:26:35.660 --> 00:26:37.690
And so that's what they did in these patients.
Say they,

411
00:26:37.691 --> 00:26:40.420
they looked at some patients who had,
um,

412
00:26:40.670 --> 00:26:45.670
no antibody titer against a Beta people who had sort of an intermediate antibody

413
00:26:46.201 --> 00:26:51.201
titer and patients who had high antibody titers against a Beta.

414
00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:54.860
And they saw that there was actually an,
uh,
really,
uh,

415
00:26:54.900 --> 00:26:59.900
tight association between that finding and the degree of amyloid plaques that

416
00:27:00.451 --> 00:27:03.300
they found in the brain at autopsy.
In other words,
patients who had,

417
00:27:03.570 --> 00:27:08.570
who in whom the vaccine really took well had hardly any antibody,

418
00:27:09.100 --> 00:27:10.980
uh,
amyloid plaques to speak of.

419
00:27:11.010 --> 00:27:15.300
Whereas patients who were either treated with placebo or in whom the vaccine

420
00:27:15.301 --> 00:27:18.810
didn't really take,
they didn't have much of a tighter against a beta.
Um,

421
00:27:18.870 --> 00:27:20.190
they had a lot of plaques left.

422
00:27:20.190 --> 00:27:24.030
So this suggested to the field that the vaccine did what it was supposed to do.

423
00:27:24.630 --> 00:27:28.320
It,
you know,
presumably help to clear amyloid plaques out of the brain.

424
00:27:29.070 --> 00:27:32.550
But it was a little bit frustrating that it didn't seem to have any effect on

425
00:27:32.551 --> 00:27:34.260
the clinical course of the disease.

426
00:27:35.430 --> 00:27:38.430
So vaccines aren't safe.
Cause,
as I said,

427
00:27:38.431 --> 00:27:42.510
you can't turn off the immune system once it starts,
but what you can do,

428
00:27:43.160 --> 00:27:48.090
um,
and here's where companies like Genentech and others,
um,
you know,
our,

429
00:27:48.091 --> 00:27:52.140
our,
uh,
uh,
really come to the fore as being important.

430
00:27:53.070 --> 00:27:57.600
What you can do is to manufacture in antibody.
All right?

431
00:27:57.601 --> 00:27:58.710
So when you give a vaccine,

432
00:27:58.711 --> 00:28:03.180
you're relying on the body to generate its own antibodies against this foreign

433
00:28:03.181 --> 00:28:06.420
protein.
But if you,
but you know,

434
00:28:06.421 --> 00:28:09.780
you can bypass that and instead,
uh,

435
00:28:09.900 --> 00:28:14.610
engineer your own antibody and we call that a monoclonal antibody when it's,

436
00:28:14.611 --> 00:28:19.200
you know,
a single antibody that's manufactured in great abundance in,
uh,
uh,
in,

437
00:28:19.201 --> 00:28:20.370
uh,
you know,
uh,

438
00:28:20.420 --> 00:28:24.490
in a manufacturing facility like Genentech or Abby or you know,

439
00:28:24.540 --> 00:28:25.920
one of these big companies has,

440
00:28:26.610 --> 00:28:31.230
so you can engineer antibodies that attack a Beta.
And the Nice thing about this,

441
00:28:31.410 --> 00:28:33.270
you know,
you put this inside of a,

442
00:28:33.271 --> 00:28:36.030
of an IV bag and you administered it to a patient.

443
00:28:36.031 --> 00:28:37.560
If a patient has a side effect,

444
00:28:37.770 --> 00:28:41.160
well you can simply stop administering the antibody,
right?

445
00:28:41.161 --> 00:28:44.010
So now you have control over the immune response.

446
00:28:44.130 --> 00:28:46.110
You can shut it off if you need to.

447
00:28:47.610 --> 00:28:51.630
And so this was exciting and now the field is excited again.

448
00:28:51.660 --> 00:28:55.260
We now have the cure for Alzheimer's disease.
We're sure of it.

449
00:28:55.590 --> 00:29:00.540
Bapineuzumab was the first drug of this next generation,

450
00:29:00.630 --> 00:29:04.710
the first of these monoclonal antibodies that was tested at big clinical trials.

451
00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:09.950
Um,
everybody was very excited about it.
No fewer than four,
uh,

452
00:29:10.020 --> 00:29:12.810
Major Pharma companies were involved with this.

453
00:29:12.820 --> 00:29:17.130
Wyeth and Alon kind of entered a partnership running these big Alzheimer's

454
00:29:17.131 --> 00:29:18.720
disease studies are very expensive.

455
00:29:18.721 --> 00:29:21.720
So it started off as a partnership between Alon and Wyeth.

456
00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:25.770
I think Johnson and Johnson then got a stake in one of those companies.

457
00:29:25.771 --> 00:29:29.310
And then Pfizer bought Wyeth anyway for different companies.

458
00:29:29.311 --> 00:29:34.140
All had a hand in this.
Um,
everybody was sure that this was going to be,

459
00:29:34.290 --> 00:29:38.550
you know,
a cure for Alzheimer's disease.
Unfortunately.
Um,

460
00:29:38.670 --> 00:29:43.670
the results of two big massive international phase three clinical trials

461
00:29:44.380 --> 00:29:49.380
revealed that there was absolutely no effect of this drug either on memory

462
00:29:49.721 --> 00:29:53.800
function or functional abilities of these patients.

463
00:29:54.520 --> 00:29:56.560
In addition,
there were side effects.

464
00:29:57.190 --> 00:30:00.220
Remember that meningitis that happened with the vaccine.

465
00:30:00.610 --> 00:30:05.610
So we saw brain swelling in patients who were given in some of the patients who

466
00:30:05.741 --> 00:30:10.090
were given this antibody.
And probably it was part of the same thing as that,

467
00:30:10.660 --> 00:30:14.380
you know,
the,
the quote unquote meningitis cases that happened with the vaccine.

468
00:30:14.710 --> 00:30:18.370
This is just brain inflammation.
Okay?

469
00:30:18.371 --> 00:30:23.371
So what we told ourselves in the field at the time was the reason that this

470
00:30:23.771 --> 00:30:28.210
clinical trial was negative was because we couldn't get the dose high enough

471
00:30:28.211 --> 00:30:30.910
without getting this side effect.
Okay.

472
00:30:30.911 --> 00:30:34.660
We couldn't get the dose high enough to really clear enough plaques out of

473
00:30:34.661 --> 00:30:37.870
people's brains in order to have that beneficial effect.

474
00:30:38.320 --> 00:30:42.460
So we convinced ourselves that this approach is not dead.

475
00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:46.660
All right?
It's just that the side effect ended up being limiting.

476
00:30:46.870 --> 00:30:49.120
So surely there must be some way around.

477
00:30:51.070 --> 00:30:52.900
Roughly at the same time,

478
00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:56.680
Eli Lilly had this antibody called Solanezumab.

479
00:30:57.520 --> 00:30:59.350
So what they tried to do here,

480
00:30:59.351 --> 00:31:04.351
they engineered their antibodies so that it bound to a form of a Beta that was

481
00:31:04.811 --> 00:31:08.770
less likely to kind of cause this big inflammatory reaction.
So they,

482
00:31:08.790 --> 00:31:13.390
they really attempted to dial down that side effect so that they could hopefully

483
00:31:13.391 --> 00:31:17.410
maximize the therapeutic effect of the antibody.
Okay.

484
00:31:17.411 --> 00:31:22.411
The field is excited again and in fact there were no side effects of this

485
00:31:22.661 --> 00:31:24.850
antibody.
It was safe.
This is great.

486
00:31:24.851 --> 00:31:28.720
You can administer now antibodies against a Beta in a way that's safe.

487
00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:30.460
That doesn't cause this brain swelling,

488
00:31:31.660 --> 00:31:34.780
but unfortunately they're big too.
You know,

489
00:31:34.781 --> 00:31:37.780
two big international phase three clinical trials.

490
00:31:37.781 --> 00:31:42.190
Well-Run trials were negative.
No effect on memory,

491
00:31:42.340 --> 00:31:46.900
no effect on daily function.
There was a little shred of optimism though.

492
00:31:47.590 --> 00:31:50.950
Now who were the people that they enrolled in their trial?

493
00:31:51.100 --> 00:31:54.700
It's actually the same kinds of people enrolled in the bapineuzumab trial.

494
00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:57.460
These were patients who already had dementia.

495
00:31:57.730 --> 00:32:00.730
They were worse than that woman that I told you about at the beginning.

496
00:32:00.731 --> 00:32:03.520
These were people who could no longer live alone,

497
00:32:03.640 --> 00:32:05.860
people who needed help with daily function,

498
00:32:06.200 --> 00:32:10.240
and remember how I told you that's actually at a fairly advanced stage of the

499
00:32:10.241 --> 00:32:11.074
illness.

500
00:32:11.920 --> 00:32:15.910
When they looked at the subgroup of patients in their clinical trials who were

501
00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:20.260
at the mildest stages at the start of the trial.
Right.
Cause you know there's a,

502
00:32:20.261 --> 00:32:23.920
there's a bit of a spectrum of,
of patients who are enrolled at the beginning.

503
00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:26.110
They're not all the same when they look,

504
00:32:26.111 --> 00:32:29.980
when they slice the data and looked at the most mildly affected patients at the

505
00:32:29.981 --> 00:32:34.330
beginning.
Um,
they saw benefit of the drug,

506
00:32:34.331 --> 00:32:38.440
about a 30% improvement in those patients.

507
00:32:39.230 --> 00:32:44.230
This was enough evidence for them to run a brand new phase three clinical trial.

508
00:32:44.300 --> 00:32:47.600
And they came to an agreement with the FDA that they just would need one more

509
00:32:47.601 --> 00:32:51.860
trial now conducted just in those mild patients.

510
00:32:53.390 --> 00:32:56.690
Um,
and it read out about a year ago,

511
00:32:57.830 --> 00:33:02.300
it was positive,
but the effect was so modest,

512
00:33:02.301 --> 00:33:06.680
something like a five,
two at most,
a 15% improvement.

513
00:33:07.490 --> 00:33:12.490
It wasn't enough to move forward because these therapies require monthly I the

514
00:33:13.551 --> 00:33:18.470
injections 150 to $200,000 per year,

515
00:33:18.620 --> 00:33:23.620
that your insurance company gets charged a five to 15% benefit,

516
00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:27.890
add smart enough it's not enough.

517
00:33:27.891 --> 00:33:31.310
And so they ended up deciding not to move forward with that drug.

518
00:33:32.500 --> 00:33:33.170
<v 3>Okay.</v>

519
00:33:33.170 --> 00:33:37.210
<v 1>At the time that Bapineuzumab and Solanezumab,
we're,
we're doing that,
we're,</v>

520
00:33:37.250 --> 00:33:37.490
you know,

521
00:33:37.490 --> 00:33:40.940
we're running those first generation clinical trials and other big discovery

522
00:33:40.941 --> 00:33:42.950
came about in the field.
You know,

523
00:33:43.460 --> 00:33:46.400
we used to have to wait till autopsy to know,
you know,

524
00:33:46.401 --> 00:33:50.030
to be able to look at the brain to know whether a patient has amyloid plaques or

525
00:33:50.031 --> 00:33:51.500
not.
Um,

526
00:33:51.830 --> 00:33:55.310
but this great technology came into widespread use,

527
00:33:55.311 --> 00:33:57.230
the use of an amyloid pet tracer.

528
00:33:57.231 --> 00:34:02.231
So this is a technology where you can use a small molecule that binds with high

529
00:34:03.321 --> 00:34:08.090
affinity to amyloid plaques and you radio label it.
All right?

530
00:34:08.091 --> 00:34:13.091
So you inject patients with this radioactive tracer molecule that in a healthy

531
00:34:13.251 --> 00:34:18.110
person finds nothing in the brain to bind to and it goes to your bladder and you

532
00:34:18.111 --> 00:34:22.040
pee it out and it's gone.
Or in a patient with Alzheimer's disease,

533
00:34:22.041 --> 00:34:25.640
it finds something to bind to and the brain and it sticks around,
right?

534
00:34:25.640 --> 00:34:28.040
So you inject a patient with this,
wait 60 minutes,

535
00:34:28.041 --> 00:34:33.041
put them in a positron emission tomography scanner that detects radioactive

536
00:34:34.611 --> 00:34:36.590
emissions to ask the question,

537
00:34:36.591 --> 00:34:39.360
did this tracer find anything in the brain to bind to?
And you,

538
00:34:39.361 --> 00:34:42.110
so you can see some examples of pictures,
uh,

539
00:34:42.230 --> 00:34:46.160
of patients with Alzheimer's disease compared to healthy controls.

540
00:34:46.490 --> 00:34:51.200
One big discovery was that the patients who were enrolled in these initial

541
00:34:51.201 --> 00:34:54.320
clinical trials in whom expert doctors like me,

542
00:34:54.710 --> 00:34:59.210
had the opinion that this patient looks to me like a typical clinical case of

543
00:34:59.211 --> 00:35:00.320
Alzheimer's disease.

544
00:35:00.740 --> 00:35:05.080
About 80% of the time expert clinicians like me or right.

545
00:35:05.890 --> 00:35:10.520
And about 20% of the time,
patients don't have any amyloid in the brain.

546
00:35:10.521 --> 00:35:11.900
They don't have Alzheimer's disease.

547
00:35:11.901 --> 00:35:14.600
They have some other illness that's making them demented,

548
00:35:14.750 --> 00:35:17.390
but it's not Alzheimer's disease.
Well,

549
00:35:17.391 --> 00:35:21.080
this is a problem if you're running a clinical trial in 20% of the people

550
00:35:21.081 --> 00:35:24.440
enrolled in your trial don't even have the disease of interest.

551
00:35:24.441 --> 00:35:29.441
So this was one big lesson learned and maybe this was the reason why some of

552
00:35:29.721 --> 00:35:31.550
these early clinical trials failed

553
00:35:33.970 --> 00:35:38.340
out of Kana Mab was the next big,
uh,
monoclonal antibody.

554
00:35:38.341 --> 00:35:41.970
This is made by a company named by a gentle little company up in Cambridge,

555
00:35:41.971 --> 00:35:46.560
Massachusetts.
They tried to solve these sins of the past.

556
00:35:46.561 --> 00:35:48.300
So they designed their clinical trial.

557
00:35:48.301 --> 00:35:53.301
They required people to have amyloid pet imaging in order to get into the trial.

558
00:35:53.850 --> 00:35:58.680
So they had to demonstrate positive evidence that they actually had amyloid in

559
00:35:58.681 --> 00:36:02.940
their brain than in other words that they truly had Alzheimer's disease.
Um,

560
00:36:03.480 --> 00:36:05.430
it turns out that there,
uh,

561
00:36:05.490 --> 00:36:09.930
antibody does bind to the form of a Beta that,
you know,

562
00:36:09.960 --> 00:36:12.420
might cause those inflammatory reactions.

563
00:36:12.960 --> 00:36:16.350
But they decided as a company that they were willing to tolerate that if they

564
00:36:16.351 --> 00:36:18.990
could somehow see some efficacy.

565
00:36:19.320 --> 00:36:24.180
And they really tried hard with the dose because another reason why that lily

566
00:36:24.181 --> 00:36:28.500
antibody Solon is a math might've failed.
They used a fairly low dose of it.

567
00:36:29.080 --> 00:36:33.270
It turns out that it's really hard to get antibodies that you inject

568
00:36:33.480 --> 00:36:37.620
intravenously to cross the blood brain barrier to get into the brain.

569
00:36:38.140 --> 00:36:38.640
Um,

570
00:36:38.640 --> 00:36:43.640
there's something like a 10,000 fold barrier concentration gradient between the

571
00:36:44.581 --> 00:36:46.440
blood and the brain.

572
00:36:46.650 --> 00:36:51.630
And so you have to really administer a boatload of these monoclonal antibodies

573
00:36:51.960 --> 00:36:55.200
in order to hope that enough of it crosses and gets into the brain.

574
00:36:55.201 --> 00:36:58.570
So in other reason why Solon is a math might've failed as their dose might've

575
00:36:58.590 --> 00:37:00.420
been too low.
So,

576
00:37:00.570 --> 00:37:03.660
so biogen tried to correct these sins of the past.

577
00:37:03.661 --> 00:37:08.040
They enrolled patients who definitely had Alzheimer's disease and they really

578
00:37:08.041 --> 00:37:10.740
tried hard to push the dose up as high as they could.

579
00:37:11.010 --> 00:37:13.110
And now for the first time ever,

580
00:37:13.111 --> 00:37:18.111
this was in 2015 at a big international conference where we saw these data for

581
00:37:18.211 --> 00:37:20.250
the first time.
Um,

582
00:37:20.610 --> 00:37:24.390
these data showed that increasing doses of the drug,

583
00:37:24.810 --> 00:37:29.580
both that 26 weeks,
so about six months and at 54 weeks,

584
00:37:29.581 --> 00:37:31.880
so about one year,
um,

585
00:37:31.950 --> 00:37:36.950
produce reductions in how much amyloid is in the brain measured by that amyloid

586
00:37:38.461 --> 00:37:40.590
pet imaging.
Right.
So you,
you know,

587
00:37:40.591 --> 00:37:44.250
put people into the scanner at baseline to make sure they have amyloid in the

588
00:37:44.251 --> 00:37:45.084
brain,

589
00:37:45.180 --> 00:37:50.040
but then you put them back in the scanner at 26 weeks and at 54 weeks and you

590
00:37:50.041 --> 00:37:53.430
see Ashwell reductions and how much amyloid is in the brain.

591
00:37:53.431 --> 00:37:58.431
So their antibody is working at least biochemically to remove plaques.

592
00:37:59.130 --> 00:38:02.700
This was incredible.
Nobody had ever shown this before in the field.

593
00:38:03.930 --> 00:38:08.100
Did it help people clinically?
And the answer was here again,

594
00:38:08.101 --> 00:38:12.720
for the very first time ever,
yes,
there was evidence of a clinical improvement.

595
00:38:12.721 --> 00:38:17.340
So the CDR thing,
this clinical dementia rating scale is kind of a,
uh,

596
00:38:17.370 --> 00:38:20.820
a summary of patients' symptoms.
And uh,

597
00:38:20.821 --> 00:38:24.150
they were able to demonstrate not so much at 26 weeks,

598
00:38:24.151 --> 00:38:29.151
but at 54 weeks there was a nice reduction and how much people worsened on,

599
00:38:30.211 --> 00:38:33.810
on the symptom scale.
Now,
this was a small trial.

600
00:38:34.500 --> 00:38:36.460
There were,
you know,
just small,

601
00:38:36.490 --> 00:38:40.690
you can see the end size 31 in the Placebo Group,
23,

602
00:38:40.691 --> 00:38:43.570
27 and so forth.
And the various treatment arms.

603
00:38:44.050 --> 00:38:48.070
This is way too small to get FDA approval for a medicine.

604
00:38:48.071 --> 00:38:51.970
You need to run a trial with hundreds of patients to really demonstrate that

605
00:38:51.971 --> 00:38:55.420
this effect is reproducible.
So this was a small trial,

606
00:38:55.421 --> 00:38:59.910
but it was the first time anybody has shown,
um,
an effect like this.
So,
uh,

607
00:38:59.940 --> 00:39:04.540
a couple of big international phase three clinical trials are going on right now

608
00:39:04.541 --> 00:39:08.350
with this antibody.
Um,
it does cause a,

609
00:39:08.351 --> 00:39:12.640
that brain swelling that I showed you in a number of people actually dropped out

610
00:39:12.641 --> 00:39:16.300
of this trial because they,
they got that brain swelling and had to quit.

611
00:39:16.301 --> 00:39:18.580
They got sick from it.
Um,

612
00:39:18.700 --> 00:39:23.700
and so the field is really waiting to see how to balance this side effect versus

613
00:39:24.701 --> 00:39:29.020
any positive benefits you get with this drug.
And so,
um,

614
00:39:29.050 --> 00:39:31.840
this is one thing to watch for in a couple of years time.

615
00:39:31.841 --> 00:39:35.590
We're going to see this clinical trial readout and it could be revolutionary

616
00:39:37.150 --> 00:39:38.890
in the meantime.
Um,

617
00:39:38.920 --> 00:39:43.920
people have developed drugs that target these enzymes that produce a Beta in the

618
00:39:43.991 --> 00:39:44.824
first place.

619
00:39:45.400 --> 00:39:49.360
So there's this gamma secretase enzyme that makes one of those two cleavage

620
00:39:49.361 --> 00:39:51.490
events that creates the a Beta protein.

621
00:39:51.520 --> 00:39:55.990
Turns out that inhibitors of Gamma secretase are poisonous,
makes people sick.

622
00:39:56.020 --> 00:39:58.240
Okay.
That doesn't work.
Um,

623
00:39:58.450 --> 00:40:03.450
Beta secretase is the other enzyme that makes the second cut that liberates that

624
00:40:04.241 --> 00:40:07.150
a Beta protein.
This inhibitors of,

625
00:40:07.200 --> 00:40:11.230
of Beta secretase seem to be less poisonous.
Um,

626
00:40:11.710 --> 00:40:12.460
and uh,

627
00:40:12.460 --> 00:40:16.420
now a number of companies have Beta secretase inhibitors that are in clinical

628
00:40:16.421 --> 00:40:17.254
trials.

629
00:40:17.740 --> 00:40:22.740
And just last week there was a big conference in Boston clinical trials in

630
00:40:23.351 --> 00:40:25.120
Alzheimer's disease.
Um,

631
00:40:25.330 --> 00:40:30.330
and we saw for the first time publicly disclosed data from Merck who had one of

632
00:40:30.461 --> 00:40:34.150
the first of these Beta secretase inhibitors.
Um,

633
00:40:34.450 --> 00:40:37.590
and then unfortunately they reported negative data,
um,

634
00:40:37.690 --> 00:40:40.270
in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease.

635
00:40:40.271 --> 00:40:44.680
And they were able to show that in fact their inhibitor did seem to reduce the

636
00:40:44.681 --> 00:40:47.530
amount of amyloid plaques in the brain.
So again,

637
00:40:47.560 --> 00:40:52.300
by there's this disconnect between evidence that the drug was doing something

638
00:40:52.301 --> 00:40:56.440
good biochemically,
but it wasn't able to produce any,

639
00:40:56.500 --> 00:40:58.180
any benefits for the patients.

640
00:41:01.310 --> 00:41:04.400
And so we're all wringing our hands and wondering,
you know,

641
00:41:04.401 --> 00:41:06.700
is the amyloid hypothesis dead?
You know,

642
00:41:06.710 --> 00:41:09.530
out of cannon Mab that biogen antibody looks promising,

643
00:41:09.531 --> 00:41:13.910
but it was a small trial and we've been in this field long enough to have seen,

644
00:41:14.330 --> 00:41:17.600
you know,
small trials that look really promising,

645
00:41:18.290 --> 00:41:20.890
that just vanish when you,
you know,

646
00:41:20.900 --> 00:41:25.370
bring it to a big international phase three trial.
Um,
so,

647
00:41:25.610 --> 00:41:26.031
you know,

648
00:41:26.031 --> 00:41:31.010
we've been in the field long enough not to get too excited and given the number

649
00:41:31.011 --> 00:41:35.180
of failures of drugs that target amyloid,
a number of us are wondering,

650
00:41:35.181 --> 00:41:38.450
is the amyloid hypothesis dead?
Um,

651
00:41:39.170 --> 00:41:43.400
Tau is,
you know,
this protein that,
you know,
again,

652
00:41:43.401 --> 00:41:47.390
it makes tangles.
The other main pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease,

653
00:41:47.391 --> 00:41:51.520
it seems to be downstream of Beta amyloid.
Um,

654
00:41:51.920 --> 00:41:56.120
and one attractive thing about,
um,
uh,
and by the way,

655
00:41:56.121 --> 00:42:00.110
the towers and the Baptist had been fighting ever since the 1980s ever since

656
00:42:00.111 --> 00:42:04.330
these proteins were discovered.
And the baptists have had the upper hand,
um,

657
00:42:04.370 --> 00:42:07.610
for a long,
long time.
But you know,
the,
the,
you know,

658
00:42:07.940 --> 00:42:12.740
this decade has really been the decade of the tower sites.
Um,
because,

659
00:42:12.770 --> 00:42:13.100
uh,

660
00:42:13.100 --> 00:42:17.900
because of all these negative results that have come from a Beta amyloid trials,

661
00:42:18.700 --> 00:42:21.860
um,
Tau does have some attractive features.
First of all,

662
00:42:21.861 --> 00:42:26.861
it seems to build up in the brain not decades before somebody gets symptoms,

663
00:42:27.530 --> 00:42:30.380
but at the same time that somebody has symptoms.

664
00:42:30.381 --> 00:42:35.090
So this is attractive if there's a nice temporal correlation between the buildup

665
00:42:35.091 --> 00:42:37.820
of a pathology and the symptoms that somebody has.

666
00:42:37.821 --> 00:42:42.821
This says that there must be some kind of better proximity of Tau to the

667
00:42:43.521 --> 00:42:46.940
neurodegenerative process.
And furthermore,

668
00:42:46.941 --> 00:42:49.170
there's this nice correlation in space.

669
00:42:49.171 --> 00:42:54.171
So the exact same brain cells that showed evidence of Tau pathology are the same

670
00:42:54.621 --> 00:42:58.930
ones that are producing symptoms.
So we,
we know,
you know,

671
00:42:58.940 --> 00:43:02.720
we know a lot about different regions of the brain and what kinds of cognitive,

672
00:43:03.110 --> 00:43:05.780
uh,
things,
different parts of the brain subserve.

673
00:43:06.050 --> 00:43:10.310
So patients with language problems,
we'll have,
you know,
uh,
uh,

674
00:43:10.460 --> 00:43:14.630
problems in their left hemisphere where the parietal and temporal lobes of the

675
00:43:14.631 --> 00:43:18.710
brain join.
And in fact,
those patients who have language problems,

676
00:43:19.010 --> 00:43:21.560
in fact show Tau pathology right there,
right?

677
00:43:21.561 --> 00:43:24.200
Where you'd expected not true of amyloid.

678
00:43:24.590 --> 00:43:27.440
Amyloid does not show up in the right places in the brain.

679
00:43:28.100 --> 00:43:33.100
So Tao has this nice tight relationship in time and in space to symptoms.

680
00:43:33.410 --> 00:43:37.700
Therefore it seems to be more proximate to the symptoms are patients have.

681
00:43:37.701 --> 00:43:40.130
And this is part of what makes it an attractive target.

682
00:43:40.550 --> 00:43:44.300
And so now we in a number of other companies have drugs.

683
00:43:44.840 --> 00:43:45.561
Now again,

684
00:43:45.561 --> 00:43:50.561
monoclonal antibodies targeting tau and it's going to take some years for these

685
00:43:51.141 --> 00:43:55.310
clinical trials to read out.
So what we've learned,
um,

686
00:43:55.311 --> 00:43:59.540
so number of things we've learned that you need to not be shy about dose.

687
00:44:00.830 --> 00:44:04.070
You need to make sure that you enroll patients who are early enough in their

688
00:44:04.071 --> 00:44:06.260
disease where you know,

689
00:44:06.570 --> 00:44:10.700
full scale neural destruction hasn't set in yet.
Um,

690
00:44:10.730 --> 00:44:14.030
you need to make sure that you actually enroll patients in trials who actually

691
00:44:14.031 --> 00:44:15.620
have Alzheimer's disease.

692
00:44:15.830 --> 00:44:20.000
And so using these molecular biomarkers to characterize patients at the

693
00:44:20.001 --> 00:44:22.970
beginning of a clinical trial is important.
Um,

694
00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:25.940
things to watch for this base inhibitor,

695
00:44:25.941 --> 00:44:29.840
this Beta secretase inhibitor called [inaudible].
This is from Merck.

696
00:44:29.841 --> 00:44:34.841
This is the one that showed a failure in patients who were already demented.

697
00:44:35.730 --> 00:44:39.870
They have another clinical trial that's still ongoing in patients with prodromal

698
00:44:39.871 --> 00:44:44.010
Alzheimer's disease,
so a milder form of the disease.
Um,

699
00:44:44.070 --> 00:44:48.780
and so even though we're now fairly pessimistic about this mechanism,

700
00:44:49.080 --> 00:44:51.350
will see that trial readout,
uh,

701
00:44:51.420 --> 00:44:56.420
fairly soon after that we'll see these big phase three trials about a Canon

702
00:44:56.820 --> 00:44:56.990
Mao-b,

703
00:44:56.990 --> 00:45:01.230
a read out that was the one that looked promising and the in the small phase one

704
00:45:01.231 --> 00:45:05.820
study and now there's a couple of other antibodies crenezumab and Gantenerumab

705
00:45:05.821 --> 00:45:10.350
that are testing slightly different mechanisms against,
against a Beta.

706
00:45:11.250 --> 00:45:15.240
Um,
and then,
uh,
it's going to be a few more years in the future,

707
00:45:15.241 --> 00:45:18.270
but we'll see these towel trials readout.
Um,

708
00:45:18.840 --> 00:45:22.260
so hopefully this has been helpful.
You'll see,
I mean,

709
00:45:22.290 --> 00:45:25.950
many of these trials actually reached the headlines in the New York times when

710
00:45:25.951 --> 00:45:28.140
they read out as,
as negative.
And so you'll,

711
00:45:28.170 --> 00:45:33.060
you'll see announcements of these trial results as they come in the coming

712
00:45:33.060 --> 00:45:35.460
months and years.
And hopefully now you have a little bit of her perspective on,

713
00:45:35.880 --> 00:45:40.590
um,
kind of the story behind,
uh,
where these,
where these treatments came from.

714
00:45:40.830 --> 00:45:44.940
So I'll pause now.
I think there's five minutes left and take some questions.

715
00:45:45.570 --> 00:45:46.403
<v 2>Okay.</v>

716
00:45:53.610 --> 00:45:54.900
So we have a mic in the back.

717
00:46:00.710 --> 00:46:04.310
<v 4>I have a couple of questions,
but I guess I'll cycle around.</v>

718
00:46:04.311 --> 00:46:07.200
So the first question I had was,
um,

719
00:46:07.790 --> 00:46:10.240
that these proteins,
the town,

720
00:46:10.260 --> 00:46:14.990
the Ab must have some kind of function in the body.

721
00:46:15.020 --> 00:46:17.210
So I'm wondering,
first of all,

722
00:46:17.211 --> 00:46:21.530
why they exist in the first place in the body with function they fulfill and

723
00:46:21.531 --> 00:46:24.830
then potentially by attacking these proteins,

724
00:46:24.831 --> 00:46:27.860
what sort of side effects are there eliminating them from the body?

725
00:46:28.410 --> 00:46:30.210
<v 1>That's a great question.
Despite,
you know,</v>

726
00:46:30.211 --> 00:46:35.211
now many decades of research on the amyloid precursor protein and the a Beta

727
00:46:35.431 --> 00:46:37.890
peptide that you know,
is liberated from it,

728
00:46:38.130 --> 00:46:39.960
we still don't know what the heck it does.

729
00:46:41.030 --> 00:46:41.863
<v 2>Okay.</v>

730
00:46:41.890 --> 00:46:46.360
<v 1>You can knock it out in mice,
doesn't have much of an effect.
Um,</v>

731
00:46:46.600 --> 00:46:49.690
you know,
we haven't,
you know,
other than brain inflammation,

732
00:46:49.691 --> 00:46:53.850
we haven't seen other side effects of drugs that seem to the,
you know,

733
00:46:53.870 --> 00:46:58.270
aim to get rid of a Beta Tau,
uh,
is a protein,

734
00:46:58.271 --> 00:47:02.020
its normal function is to kind of sit on microtubules.

735
00:47:02.021 --> 00:47:06.550
Microtubules are part of the skeleton of a neuron,
um,
that,
uh,

736
00:47:06.710 --> 00:47:10.900
in the axons,
the long protrusions,
the wires,
uh,
from neurons,

737
00:47:10.930 --> 00:47:14.380
these microtubules are sort of the backbone of,
of axons.

738
00:47:14.650 --> 00:47:17.170
Tau Is this protein that kind of sits on top of that.

739
00:47:17.410 --> 00:47:21.460
There are other proteins that also sit on top of it to kind of stabilize these

740
00:47:21.461 --> 00:47:25.120
microtubules.
Towel doesn't seem to be unique.
If it's gone,

741
00:47:25.121 --> 00:47:26.740
other proteins do its job.

742
00:47:26.920 --> 00:47:31.360
You can not tell out of mice and the mice have absolutely no phenotype.

743
00:47:31.361 --> 00:47:36.310
There's no symptoms.
They're normal.
Um,
so,
you know,
towel probably we,

744
00:47:36.340 --> 00:47:39.310
I think we understand a little bit about what towel does normally,

745
00:47:39.610 --> 00:47:44.020
but it's a redundant function to other proteins.
Um,
the amyloid protein,

746
00:47:44.021 --> 00:47:44.920
we really,
again,

747
00:47:44.921 --> 00:47:48.940
after decades of research really don't understand what it does normally.

748
00:47:48.941 --> 00:47:49.774
If anything.

749
00:47:53.330 --> 00:47:56.630
<v 5>Hi,
thanks very much.
Um,
I had just two quick questions.</v>

750
00:47:56.900 --> 00:48:01.370
I was wondering if you can comment on the relationship between cardiovascular

751
00:48:01.371 --> 00:48:05.520
disease and Alzheimer's and also the,

752
00:48:05.720 --> 00:48:10.220
the role of Diet in sort of specifically like tumeric.
Um,

753
00:48:10.730 --> 00:48:12.740
this impacts on Alzheimer's.

754
00:48:13.290 --> 00:48:18.010
<v 1>Great.
So risk factors for Alzheimer's disease include,
um,
uh,</v>

755
00:48:18.060 --> 00:48:21.090
cardiovascular disease and diabetes,
the Metabolic Syndrome,

756
00:48:21.091 --> 00:48:24.840
this become so endemic in our society.
Um,

757
00:48:24.900 --> 00:48:27.930
the relationship is a little bit unclear and it might be indirect.

758
00:48:28.200 --> 00:48:32.790
Remember these pathological changes in Alzheimer's disease build up over decades

759
00:48:33.720 --> 00:48:35.550
and there's a threshold effect,
right?

760
00:48:35.551 --> 00:48:40.020
There's some threshold at which those biochemical changes in the brain becomes

761
00:48:40.021 --> 00:48:43.200
severe enough that now you have symptoms,

762
00:48:43.950 --> 00:48:47.370
a number of factors determine where that threshold is.

763
00:48:47.730 --> 00:48:49.920
Other damage to the brain,
for instance,

764
00:48:49.921 --> 00:48:54.600
to the brains of vasculature might lower the threshold.
So that a given,

765
00:48:54.780 --> 00:48:55.111
you know,

766
00:48:55.111 --> 00:49:00.111
a given amount of a Beta and tau that in one person doesn't cause symptoms in

767
00:49:00.541 --> 00:49:04.140
somebody who has,
you know,
simultaneous damage to the brain,

768
00:49:04.141 --> 00:49:08.790
chronic damage to the brain from poor blood supply because of high cholesterol

769
00:49:08.791 --> 00:49:12.780
and high blood pressure and diabetes,
maybe that threshold is lowered.

770
00:49:12.780 --> 00:49:15.420
So it could be an effect like that.
Um,

771
00:49:15.450 --> 00:49:19.380
some scientists think that there might be a more direct effect on Beta amyloid

772
00:49:19.381 --> 00:49:21.720
metabolism,
but I think that's less clear.

773
00:49:21.990 --> 00:49:26.940
Things like diet and exercise,
um,
probably feed into it.

774
00:49:26.941 --> 00:49:29.400
Also education level,
how much,
you know,

775
00:49:29.401 --> 00:49:32.460
attending lectures like this in the middle of the day is good for the brain,

776
00:49:32.461 --> 00:49:35.380
you form extra synopsis and uh,

777
00:49:35.490 --> 00:49:39.630
make it possible for the brain to sort of weather damage a little bit better.

778
00:49:39.840 --> 00:49:44.460
So there's a number of complex things that feed into that threshold effect.
Um,

779
00:49:44.490 --> 00:49:45.600
but,
but you know,

780
00:49:45.601 --> 00:49:49.980
but those things may not affect the actual accumulation of the amyloid and tau

781
00:49:49.981 --> 00:49:51.210
proteins themselves.

782
00:49:52.590 --> 00:49:53.880
<v 6>So you mentioned,
uh,</v>

783
00:49:53.881 --> 00:49:58.440
that the treatment that was successful for rats but not for people.
Was that the,

784
00:49:58.460 --> 00:50:02.450
the manufactured antibody or the it,
the immunization.

785
00:50:02.550 --> 00:50:06.930
<v 1>Everything that I've told you about today has cured multimers disease.</v>

786
00:50:07.820 --> 00:50:12.040
We have cured of Alzheimer's disease over and over and over again.
Uh,

787
00:50:12.070 --> 00:50:17.070
what this tells us is that the mouse models are not great replicants of the

788
00:50:17.341 --> 00:50:18.480
human disease.

789
00:50:18.950 --> 00:50:23.570
<v 6>Got It.
Okay.
Cause my,
yeah,
I was going to ask you,
uh,
if you,
if,</v>

790
00:50:23.590 --> 00:50:28.070
if any research has gone into what it might be different human brains

791
00:50:28.070 --> 00:50:29.030
<v 4>then mouse brains,</v>

792
00:50:29.031 --> 00:50:33.500
that is it like our defense mechanisms of our brains that prevent that treatment

793
00:50:33.501 --> 00:50:34.190
from working right

794
00:50:34.190 --> 00:50:35.940
<v 1>on us.
It's a lot of things.
I mean,
the,</v>

795
00:50:35.941 --> 00:50:38.450
the complexity of the Oregon is much greater.

796
00:50:38.700 --> 00:50:43.700
The genetics is obviously different.
Um,
and just the chronicity of the disease.

797
00:50:43.701 --> 00:50:47.690
I mean a mouse only lives two years.
Um,
the human brain,
you know,

798
00:50:47.750 --> 00:50:52.730
assembles damage from,
you know,
six,
seven,
eight decades.

799
00:50:52.760 --> 00:50:57.530
Um,
and uh,
it's just,
it's hard to model that in a,
in a,

800
00:50:57.531 --> 00:50:58.364
in a mouse.

801
00:50:59.420 --> 00:51:00.253
<v 2>Okay.</v>

802
00:51:00.300 --> 00:51:04.600
<v 1>Oh,
my mother was prescribed Namenda by her,
a general practitioner,</v>

803
00:51:04.601 --> 00:51:06.310
which I know was not mentioned.

804
00:51:06.730 --> 00:51:10.630
Is that likely to do anything useful in cases like this?
Good.

805
00:51:10.631 --> 00:51:13.840
So there's four drugs that are FDA approved for Alzheimer's disease.

806
00:51:13.841 --> 00:51:17.410
Namenda is one of them.
Um,
they're not ineffective.

807
00:51:17.440 --> 00:51:19.060
These four drugs do something.

808
00:51:19.061 --> 00:51:21.340
They squeeze a little bit more juice out of the brain.

809
00:51:21.341 --> 00:51:23.680
They're what we call symptomatic drugs.

810
00:51:24.250 --> 00:51:29.110
And that they don't change the inevitable course of the disease to worsen over

811
00:51:29.111 --> 00:51:31.570
time.
They don't change the slope of the curve,

812
00:51:32.050 --> 00:51:34.480
but they sort of shift the curve up a little bit.

813
00:51:34.900 --> 00:51:38.350
If your mother were to run out of her prescription and stopped the drug,

814
00:51:38.590 --> 00:51:41.920
she would drop right back down to the curve that she would have been on had.

815
00:51:41.921 --> 00:51:43.750
She'd never taken it.
So it doesn't,

816
00:51:43.870 --> 00:51:47.770
so these drugs don't fundamentally change anything about the biochemistry in the

817
00:51:47.771 --> 00:51:51.340
brain or sort of,
you know,
the disease process itself.

818
00:51:51.341 --> 00:51:54.940
And that's why we call them symptom treaters,
the,
the drugs and the,

819
00:51:55.030 --> 00:51:57.700
but I mean the drugs are still good because they do something,

820
00:51:57.970 --> 00:51:59.170
it's not enough though.

821
00:51:59.230 --> 00:52:03.520
We need so called disease modifying therapies that actually interfere on the

822
00:52:03.521 --> 00:52:07.870
biochemical progression of the disease and the brain.
Um,
and actually,
you know,

823
00:52:07.871 --> 00:52:11.620
slow,
you know,
change the slope of the curve fundamentally.
And that's,

824
00:52:11.650 --> 00:52:14.110
that's what these drugs purport to be able to do,

825
00:52:14.111 --> 00:52:16.330
although none has been successful yet.

826
00:52:18.370 --> 00:52:19.203
<v 2>Okay.</v>

827
00:52:19.260 --> 00:52:22.260
<v 4>So looking at the graph with the amyloid and the tower,</v>

828
00:52:22.330 --> 00:52:26.820
it like seem to pretty immediately clear that the tau correlates with the

829
00:52:26.821 --> 00:52:29.730
symptoms as you mentioned.
Um,
first of all,

830
00:52:29.731 --> 00:52:32.800
why wasn't that examined sooner and why?

831
00:52:32.801 --> 00:52:37.801
Why weren't Anti Tau drugs developed in tandem with the antiamyloid ones?

832
00:52:39.720 --> 00:52:42.300
Second of all,
uh,
in the mice,

833
00:52:42.301 --> 00:52:46.200
you said they squirted the brain with the amyloid protein.

834
00:52:46.560 --> 00:52:51.560
Have they done the same thing with the Tao and seen like if it's the combination

835
00:52:52.021 --> 00:52:55.800
of those two proteins or is it one or the other that's actually causing the

836
00:52:55.801 --> 00:52:56.634
symptoms?

837
00:52:56.740 --> 00:52:57.940
<v 1>So it turns out you can make,</v>

838
00:52:58.030 --> 00:53:02.740
you can present towel to the brain in a way that it's toxic also.
Um,

839
00:53:02.770 --> 00:53:07.420
but you just ask a question that's at the heart of what has been a big debate in

840
00:53:07.421 --> 00:53:10.180
our field for a long time.
Um,

841
00:53:10.750 --> 00:53:14.470
why did the baptists have the upper hand for so many years?

842
00:53:14.800 --> 00:53:18.640
Part of it as the genetic evidence.
So you tations in towel.

843
00:53:19.620 --> 00:53:19.930
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

844
00:53:19.930 --> 00:53:23.290
<v 1>they actually caused dementia but they don't cause Alzheimer's disease.</v>

845
00:53:23.291 --> 00:53:27.420
They cause a different disease.
Ferno temporal dementia,
um,

846
00:53:27.450 --> 00:53:30.810
that causes degeneration of very different parts of the brain,

847
00:53:30.990 --> 00:53:35.070
very different symptoms.
It's a,
it's a different disease to Alzheimer's disease.

848
00:53:35.580 --> 00:53:38.110
It's only mutations in,
um,

849
00:53:38.580 --> 00:53:43.230
that amyloid precursor protein or in the proteins that metabolize it to create

850
00:53:43.231 --> 00:53:47.970
the a Beta protein or down syndrome where you have three copies of that gene.

851
00:53:48.150 --> 00:53:51.090
It's only those diseases that,
uh,
you know,

852
00:53:51.091 --> 00:53:55.970
seem to cause Alzheimer's disease.
There's actually an Iceland,
there's a,

853
00:53:55.990 --> 00:54:00.810
uh,
a family that has a mutation in their amyloid precursor protein such that it

854
00:54:00.811 --> 00:54:04.740
cannot be cleaved by one of those two cleaving enzymes.

855
00:54:04.741 --> 00:54:06.750
And they can't that in that family,

856
00:54:06.900 --> 00:54:11.900
you cannot make the a Beta protein and those patients cannot get Alzheimer's

857
00:54:12.061 --> 00:54:15.840
disease.
So there's this great wealth of genetic evidence,

858
00:54:15.870 --> 00:54:20.870
overwhelming genetic evidence of the primacy of a Beta as a causative factor in

859
00:54:22.051 --> 00:54:26.640
a d.
And that's part of how the baptists had this upper hand for so long,

860
00:54:26.641 --> 00:54:31.360
despite that nice temporal relationship between talent pathology and uh,

861
00:54:31.460 --> 00:54:36.240
and symptoms,
Tau was just regarded as being this downstream factor,

862
00:54:36.420 --> 00:54:40.140
but not really the root of the disease.
That may still be true,

863
00:54:40.500 --> 00:54:44.670
but as long as we're treating symptomatic patients tell might be a better
target.

864
00:54:45.390 --> 00:54:48.570
<v 4>Right.
And it seems like you could kill two birds with one stone,</v>

865
00:54:48.590 --> 00:54:51.760
potentially treat the other disease.
Right.
I mean,

866
00:54:51.820 --> 00:54:56.820
I guess does the amyloid causes the symptoms or is it contributing to the

867
00:54:58.001 --> 00:55:00.820
production of Tau,
which causes the symptoms to you?

868
00:55:01.060 --> 00:55:02.710
Is there an answer for that yet?
Nope.
Ah,

869
00:55:05.580 --> 00:55:06.870
<v 1>great.
Thanks everybody.</v>
