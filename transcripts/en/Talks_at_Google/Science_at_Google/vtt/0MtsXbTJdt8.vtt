1
00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:09.670
So I've been fascinated by charisma and people skills ever since I used to play

2
00:00:09.671 --> 00:00:11.410
dungeons and dragons while I was growing up.

3
00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.950
Characters or the high charisma could just roll the dice and get people to do

4
00:00:14.951 --> 00:00:19.180
whatever they wanted.
A while.
My wizard could never get anybody to do anything.

5
00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:24.190
Go figure.
I always thought charisma be a great power to have in the real world.

6
00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:28.270
Vanessa van Edwards is a behavioral investigator,
published author,

7
00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:32.620
public speaker and body language and trainer specializing in science based

8
00:00:32.621 --> 00:00:35.440
people skills.
She runs the science of people,

9
00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.230
which is a human behavior research lab in Portland,

10
00:00:38.231 --> 00:00:42.340
Oregon where she studies charisma,
influence and power body language.

11
00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:45.310
Apple chose it as one of the most anticipated books of the year.

12
00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.040
So let's give a warm welcome to Vanessa van Edwards.

13
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.770
<v 0>Thanks for joining me on your lunch break.</v>

14
00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:59.400
I am so excited to be here because I really get to dive into the science of

15
00:00:59.401 --> 00:01:02.130
people and I'm a data geek or research geeks.

16
00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:06.060
Hopefully say we can go over some of my favorite studies.
So as mentioned,

17
00:01:06.061 --> 00:01:07.770
I run a human behavior research lab,

18
00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.060
which is basically an excuse for me to ask invasively personal questions for my

19
00:01:12.061 --> 00:01:15.300
own amusement and we do all kinds of studies in our lab.

20
00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.560
One of the first that I want to talk about is very relevant to us.

21
00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:24.420
So one thing that I do is I critique the body language of candidates for

22
00:01:24.421 --> 00:01:28.440
different news outlets.
It was a busy year for me last year.
It was kept very,

23
00:01:28.441 --> 00:01:31.050
very busy and I was curious,
you know,

24
00:01:31.051 --> 00:01:33.510
we were focused this year or so much on politics.

25
00:01:33.511 --> 00:01:36.420
It's dominating the news and I was wondering is there any kind of research that

26
00:01:36.421 --> 00:01:41.130
I can find in our history?
So we embarked on a decent size study.

27
00:01:41.131 --> 00:01:42.090
I wasn't sure what you're going to find.

28
00:01:42.091 --> 00:01:45.570
What we did is we analyze the last 20 inaugural addresses.

29
00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.720
The reason why we picked the last twenty's because the oldest one we could find

30
00:01:48.721 --> 00:01:51.450
that was video with 1944 was Truman.

31
00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:54.240
And so we wanted to analyze many different things.

32
00:01:54.241 --> 00:01:59.100
We analyze everything from ty color to body language patterns to vocal patterns.

33
00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.480
We partner with a company called quantified communications to analyze the words

34
00:02:03.481 --> 00:02:07.740
used in each inauguration speech.
And we found some kind of interesting patterns.

35
00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:11.760
So I was wondering if we could guess some of those patterns together.

36
00:02:11.761 --> 00:02:13.980
Just have a couple of quizzes for us to see if I can get it.

37
00:02:13.981 --> 00:02:17.280
So we use body language patterns,
word usage patterns,
timing,

38
00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:20.640
whether tie color and podium use,
just to see what we would find,

39
00:02:20.641 --> 00:02:22.400
see if we found any kind of interesting things.

40
00:02:22.401 --> 00:02:26.130
So we'll test your political knowledge with some presidential Bingo.

41
00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.220
There's one place where was going to go.
All right,
good,
good.

42
00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.160
We'll get us warmed up a little bit.
So here is the very first question,

43
00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:37.740
who use the most hand gestures?
Your choices are John F.
Kennedy,
Donald Trump,

44
00:02:37.741 --> 00:02:41.400
Bill Clinton,
Ronald Reagan.
Now the question is,
is this a trick question?
Right?

45
00:02:41.401 --> 00:02:43.890
That's what you're wondering.
So go with your gut.

46
00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.270
How many people think it's John F.
Kennedy?
How are living?
It's Donald Trump.

47
00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:55.260
Bill Clinton.
How you think it's Ronald Reagan?
It's a pretty evenly split.

48
00:02:55.261 --> 00:02:57.030
You are right.
If you said Donald Trump,

49
00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:02.360
Donald Trump used 641 hand gestures in 17 minutes.

50
00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:10.060
That's impressive,
my friends.
That's impressive.
By the way,
Ronald Reagan,

51
00:03:10.061 --> 00:03:13.900
the great communicator,
zero hand gestures,

52
00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:19.000
I was shocked by that.
He actually gripped the podium in fear.

53
00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.980
So Ronald Reagan,
Jimmy Carter,
Richard and Richard M.
Nixon,

54
00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:28.540
that beast right there,
that podium destroyed their hand charisma.

55
00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:30.220
So that's why I'm going to be avoiding it.

56
00:03:30.221 --> 00:03:33.550
How as much as possible trying to get away from the podium.
And by the way,

57
00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:38.140
Donald Trump,
six 41 close second was Barack Obama's second term.
By the way,

58
00:03:38.141 --> 00:03:41.170
the difference between Barack Obama's first inaugural address in a second,

59
00:03:41.171 --> 00:03:44.890
I'll go dress on paper,
looked like two totally different presidents,

60
00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:48.130
totally different hand gestures,
totally different amount of smiling,

61
00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:52.150
different word usage patterns.
Two totally different goals.

62
00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:54.060
Now I mentioned hand gestures,

63
00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:57.430
the power of hand gestures and why I'm avoiding that little podium over there.

64
00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:59.440
The reason for this is I always do.

65
00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:02.680
The research was quite robust on the importance of hand gestures,

66
00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.620
but I didn't know how important it was for charisma.

67
00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:08.350
So every day at lunch I watch a Ted talk,

68
00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:13.750
I love Ted talks and the Ted Junkie and I was searching in ted.com leadership

69
00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:18.220
and their search bar up popped two talks,
one by Simon Sinek.

70
00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:21.910
Probably most of you have seen it called something like the great leaders of

71
00:04:21.911 --> 00:04:24.310
tomorrow.
It has over 45 million views.

72
00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.570
Another talk also popped up by fields,
wicker Mirin.

73
00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:33.870
This had under 40,000 and I looked at these two talks and I thought both of

74
00:04:35.441 --> 00:04:40.360
these talks are 18 minutes long.
Both of them have almost the same title.

75
00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:44.860
Both of them were given by relatively unknown experts in the beginning.

76
00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:49.720
Simon Sinek got famous from his Ted talk and both of them are on the same kind

77
00:04:49.721 --> 00:04:52.330
of topic and they came out the same month of the same year,

78
00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:56.620
September of 2009 why did one talk go viral and one didn't?

79
00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:00.310
Why is it certain people can walk into a room and you go,
yeah,

80
00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:01.810
I want to know that person.

81
00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:04.380
Whereas other people walk into a room and you're like,
man,

82
00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:06.460
I don't even know if I've met them before.

83
00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:12.870
So we decided to analyze thousands of hours of ted talks over many months.

84
00:05:13.091 --> 00:05:17.680
We analyzed every single Ted talk from 2010 and compared any patterns we could

85
00:05:17.681 --> 00:05:18.760
find to view count.

86
00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:23.920
The biggest difference we found is that the most popular Ted talkers use an

87
00:05:23.921 --> 00:05:28.900
average of 465 hand gestures and just 18 minutes.
My coders,

88
00:05:28.901 --> 00:05:31.900
I love you.
They painstakingly counted every single hand gesture.

89
00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:35.530
So they use an average of 465 hand gestures.

90
00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:40.800
The least popular tedtalks use an average of 272 hand gestures,

91
00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:44.800
almost half.
What's going on here?

92
00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:48.970
So the academic research is pretty clear on hand gestures.
What happens is,

93
00:05:48.971 --> 00:05:51.620
is when we see someone's hands,
and if you watch ted talks,

94
00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:57.650
Ted Talker,
offstage,
and there's a red.in the middle,
they go like this,

95
00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:03.410
come to the red dot.
Today I want to talk to you about a big idea.

96
00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:08.960
I'm going to break it down to three different areas that are going to change

97
00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:13.160
your life,
right?
They all do that.

98
00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:17.420
They actually don't all do that.
But the most popular talks,

99
00:06:17.421 --> 00:06:20.150
the ones that we've seen,
they do that.
In other words,

100
00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:23.810
they're kind of signaling or triggering your brain to say,

101
00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:26.000
this is gonna be good.

102
00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:30.050
Like that's basically what they're saying because we give a lot of weight to

103
00:06:30.051 --> 00:06:34.760
hand gestures.
So if I say I have a really big idea,

104
00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:37.400
it's huge.

105
00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:43.850
Your brain laughs because you're like,
it's not very big.

106
00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:48.410
Look how small it is.
Where if I'm like,
I have a big idea,
you're like,

107
00:06:48.411 --> 00:06:50.390
Whoa,
that is a big one.

108
00:06:50.391 --> 00:06:55.220
It's almost a beach ball size big and that is because our brains give 12.5 times

109
00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:57.560
more weight to our hand gestures.

110
00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:02.260
So the best ted talkers are actually doing something very interesting there.

111
00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:06.770
Speaking to you on two different tracks.
They're using their words,

112
00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:10.190
but they're also explaining their words along with their hands.

113
00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:14.300
They're actually giving you cliff notes with their hands.
They're saying,

114
00:07:14.301 --> 00:07:16.970
I have a really specific thing I want to tell you.
Look how specific it is.

115
00:07:16.971 --> 00:07:20.060
I can actually hold it in my hand just like that.
Or they're saying,

116
00:07:20.061 --> 00:07:23.210
I have three different things that I want to show you,
and they tell you one,
two,

117
00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:25.970
three.
They cue you or they say they have a big idea.

118
00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:27.980
They say they're bringing two different groups together,

119
00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:30.020
or they say there's three different levels.

120
00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:31.970
Or they say it really means a lot to them.

121
00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:37.190
All of those things are like bolding or highlighting their words along with

122
00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:39.410
their hands,
hands along with their words.

123
00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:43.700
So we found that was a huge indicator of charisma.
As I mentioned,

124
00:07:43.701 --> 00:07:47.660
our nonverbal signals are 12 to 13 times more powerful than our words.

125
00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:52.100
So for example,
if I were to come up here today and say,
Hi Google,

126
00:07:52.101 --> 00:07:55.040
I'm so happy to be here.

127
00:07:56.150 --> 00:07:59.840
You would know because of my voice tone,
my facial expressions,
my body language,

128
00:07:59.841 --> 00:08:03.170
that that wasn't true because you give more weight to my nonverbal.

129
00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:07.970
Let's go into the next one talking about emotionality and how we read emotion.

130
00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:12.020
So looking at word usage,
passion,
language,
persuasive language,

131
00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:16.310
which president used the most emotional language?

132
00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:20.630
The choices are John F.
Kennedy,
Donald Trump,
Jimmy Carter,
and George W.
Bush.

133
00:08:20.810 --> 00:08:25.190
How many would think John F.
Kennedy?
How will people think Donald Trump?

134
00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:30.050
Okay,
how would willing Jimmy Carter got to one taker?
All right.

135
00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:33.230
How many people think George W.
Bush three takers?

136
00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:36.350
This one was shocking,
right?
By the way,
for people at home,

137
00:08:36.351 --> 00:08:38.090
only three people voted for George W.
Bush.

138
00:08:38.091 --> 00:08:40.790
People at home always like to be come with us,
participate.

139
00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:45.380
So when we look at the breakdown of this four paws for emotional language,

140
00:08:45.530 --> 00:08:48.710
so I was shocked by the way that George W.
Bush has no social language.

141
00:08:48.711 --> 00:08:52.550
Most people are that surprising.
Second was Jimmy Carter,

142
00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:57.300
but not by a lot.
And our emotional youth was Lyndon.

143
00:08:57.301 --> 00:08:59.580
B Johnson,
the least emotional language.

144
00:09:01.450 --> 00:09:06.250
Now here's the question.
Which party uses more emotional language?

145
00:09:06.610 --> 00:09:09.310
So how many of you think that Republicans use more emotional language?

146
00:09:10.660 --> 00:09:14.970
How am I going to think the Democrats?
People are now afraid to vote.

147
00:09:14.971 --> 00:09:17.490
I can see people are afraid to vote.
So this time,

148
00:09:17.491 --> 00:09:20.700
so the publicans actually use more emotional language.

149
00:09:20.701 --> 00:09:23.040
They use much more emotional language.
Whereas Democrats,
by the way,

150
00:09:23.041 --> 00:09:25.650
you used more numbers and that,
that's hard design here.

151
00:09:25.651 --> 00:09:29.220
But I'm happy to send out the white paper.
So the Democrats use more data,

152
00:09:29.250 --> 00:09:32.430
more numbers we call logic in their speeches.

153
00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:34.350
Whereas Republicans are much more emotional.

154
00:09:35.970 --> 00:09:38.640
Which party uses more I language.

155
00:09:38.670 --> 00:09:41.460
So more uses of I,

156
00:09:41.490 --> 00:09:44.100
me or my versus we,

157
00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:48.970
our US Democrats,
Republicans or it's about the same.
How would you,

158
00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:50.190
you think Democrats,

159
00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:54.960
how many people think Republicans and help you think it's about the same.

160
00:09:56.220 --> 00:09:59.760
So this one absolutely republicans do use more.

161
00:09:59.761 --> 00:10:04.430
We our US language.
Next one.
What is the most popular Thai color?

162
00:10:04.431 --> 00:10:08.570
Go into a little more fun thing here.
A little less.
Little less important.

163
00:10:08.571 --> 00:10:10.070
So we looked at the tie colors.

164
00:10:10.071 --> 00:10:14.660
We were just curious to see if there was any pattern there.
Um,
choices.
Blue,
red,

165
00:10:14.661 --> 00:10:17.350
gray or there was a tie together.

166
00:10:18.910 --> 00:10:21.050
I'd tie between red and blue.

167
00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:25.070
That made me laugh so hard when I wrote my own slides.
Like I can't tell you.

168
00:10:25.071 --> 00:10:27.680
Okay.
So how are we building blue?

169
00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:33.480
Only three or four.
How am I going to read most of you?
How would you think?
Gray.

170
00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:34.690
<v 1>Okay.</v>

171
00:10:34.690 --> 00:10:36.820
<v 0>Couple.
How do you think there was a tie between red and blue?</v>

172
00:10:37.390 --> 00:10:41.610
That was just funny guys.
It wasn't actually true,
sadly.
So this one is,

173
00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:47.650
my road is broken.
Maybe not.
It's really dramatic.
Right?

174
00:10:47.710 --> 00:10:51.490
We're really exciting.
Did it work?
Yes,
it worked.
Just delayed blue.

175
00:10:51.790 --> 00:10:54.360
So very few of you guessed blew most of you guys red.

176
00:10:55.860 --> 00:11:00.170
I don't know what's happening here.
Um,

177
00:11:00.171 --> 00:11:04.970
so with the,
there was actually 10 presidents that were blue ties.

178
00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.430
Only four presidents were red ties.

179
00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:10.910
I think less than three wore gray or black.

180
00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:14.960
The problem is is that someone told me that they think that the reason for this

181
00:11:14.961 --> 00:11:16.970
is actually not emotional.
We're not a choice.

182
00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:19.100
It's because actually blue looks better on camera.

183
00:11:19.490 --> 00:11:22.760
So this might be different if we looked at speeches that were older and time,

184
00:11:22.761 --> 00:11:26.600
but more presidents were blue.
How about this one?
Who had the shortest speech?

185
00:11:26.601 --> 00:11:30.590
Your choices are Lyndon,
B Johnson,
Gerald Ford,
George W,
Bush,
John F,
Kennedy.

186
00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:33.570
How would you think Lyndon B Johnson?
It's a couple of you.

187
00:11:33.571 --> 00:11:38.070
How it will think drove forward.
George W.
Bush,

188
00:11:38.940 --> 00:11:40.530
how people think,
John F.
Kennedy.

189
00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:45.000
So this one is Gerald Ford.
Eight minutes.

190
00:11:45.540 --> 00:11:46.880
What was funny about this back?

191
00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:50.820
The only reason I included it is because he had the shortest by far.
The longest,

192
00:11:50.821 --> 00:11:55.390
by the way,
was 22 minutes.
He also had the best weather day of any candidate.

193
00:11:55.690 --> 00:11:57.360
So that it was funny that he had the shortest speech.

194
00:11:57.370 --> 00:12:00.400
We didn't take advantage of that beautiful weather.
So Gerald Ford,

195
00:12:00.430 --> 00:12:01.211
Lyndon B Johnson,

196
00:12:01.211 --> 00:12:05.500
for those of you who guessed him was second and two it Eisenhower was after
that.

197
00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:11.200
Here's a good question.
Which party speaks more?
So the amount of minutes used?

198
00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:15.460
Was it more Democrats from Republicans?
How many thing the Democrats spoke more?

199
00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:20.890
How many like Republicans spoke more?
You'd be right.
Those of you Republicans,

200
00:12:20.891 --> 00:12:22.510
Republicans used more minutes,

201
00:12:22.511 --> 00:12:26.410
61% versus 39% of the minutes spoken,

202
00:12:27.850 --> 00:12:31.060
which presidents smiled the most.
So we,

203
00:12:31.061 --> 00:12:35.290
what we did here for this is we actually had a stopwatch and we actually stopped

204
00:12:35.291 --> 00:12:39.160
the watch every time the smell to get the total number of seconds smile during

205
00:12:39.161 --> 00:12:43.590
an inauguration speech.
So your choices are Bill Clinton,
Jimmy Carter,

206
00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:47.890
George Bush senior,
and Barack Obama.
How many feel Bill Clinton smiled the most.

207
00:12:48.370 --> 00:12:50.380
A lot of you.
How many people think Jimmy Carter?

208
00:12:51.580 --> 00:12:55.180
How many of you think George Bush Sr?
We got one.

209
00:12:55.181 --> 00:12:57.340
Guess how many will think Barack Obama?

210
00:12:58.210 --> 00:13:03.210
So this one is Barack Obama smile the most in his second term inaugural address.

211
00:13:04.870 --> 00:13:07.330
Remember how I said the first and second term?
We're totally different.

212
00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:08.261
His second term,

213
00:13:08.261 --> 00:13:12.340
he was much happier just so you can see the number of seconds clocked.

214
00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:17.070
14.5 seconds by Barack Obama.
So only one person I think over here,
guests.

215
00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:21.790
George was senior actually second,
which really surprised me with 13.5 seconds.

216
00:13:21.970 --> 00:13:25.870
Bill Clinton,
Ronald Reagan and Jimmy Carter after that,
by the way,

217
00:13:25.871 --> 00:13:28.120
usually I have really beautiful pictures,
need slides,

218
00:13:28.330 --> 00:13:30.550
but we don't have the rights to all those president pictures.

219
00:13:30.551 --> 00:13:32.320
So you'll have to stick with just my text.

220
00:13:32.890 --> 00:13:37.270
So the next study we did off that smiling research with the presidents is I

221
00:13:37.271 --> 00:13:40.780
thought,
okay,
we know some things about political leaders,
some patterns.

222
00:13:41.110 --> 00:13:45.460
How about business leaders?
How about entrepreneurs?
How about investors?

223
00:13:45.940 --> 00:13:48.970
So I love the show shark tank to anyone else.
Watch the show shark tank.

224
00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:51.550
So I love that show in the show.
If you haven't seen it,

225
00:13:51.551 --> 00:13:56.170
it's a panel of investors named sharks are pitched by entrepreneurs who come

226
00:13:56.171 --> 00:14:00.190
into the tank.
So I was fascinated to see what their patterns,

227
00:14:00.191 --> 00:14:02.470
we the most successful least successful entrepreneurs,

228
00:14:02.471 --> 00:14:03.640
because I don't know about you,

229
00:14:03.641 --> 00:14:07.030
I watched that show or I watch people pitch and a lot of time I think it's more

230
00:14:07.031 --> 00:14:09.010
about the charisma than their actual idea.

231
00:14:09.580 --> 00:14:11.590
So I wanted to see was there any truth to that?

232
00:14:11.620 --> 00:14:15.130
Was there any difference happening behind the scenes?
So what we did,

233
00:14:15.430 --> 00:14:17.650
me and my coder Jose Pena,
you're amazing.

234
00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:23.280
Researched all 495 pitches on shark tank.

235
00:14:24.011 --> 00:14:27.880
It took us six months and he coded every variable we could think of.

236
00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:32.260
So everything from the introduction to their grand entrance to the amount of

237
00:14:32.261 --> 00:14:35.320
times the sharks laughed to try to find patterns.

238
00:14:35.321 --> 00:14:37.210
So let's see how we do on some of these.

239
00:14:37.211 --> 00:14:40.030
So here are the things we tracked specifically body language patterns.

240
00:14:40.031 --> 00:14:43.300
We spent a lot of time on the first impression.
Those first few seconds,

241
00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:46.270
trying to see if the research about first impressions is actually true.

242
00:14:46.690 --> 00:14:50.080
We looked for pitch patterns.
So a,
what was the structure of a pitch?

243
00:14:50.081 --> 00:14:53.450
Some stock sharks,
entrepreneurs pitch with the hero's journey,

244
00:14:53.510 --> 00:14:55.070
like they talk about their personal journey,

245
00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:58.760
whereas other entrepreneurs talk about the pioneering aspect of their ideas.

246
00:14:58.761 --> 00:15:00.440
We wanted to see what their pitch patterns there.

247
00:15:00.740 --> 00:15:03.080
And we also looked again at word usage patterns.

248
00:15:04.850 --> 00:15:08.000
The biggest thing we found right off the bat was there was a deal breaker.

249
00:15:08.330 --> 00:15:11.660
So if you did not know your math,
that broke you no matter what.

250
00:15:11.660 --> 00:15:12.980
No matter how charismatic you,

251
00:15:12.981 --> 00:15:16.340
where if you couldn't get past that passed the math problems,
you couldn't do it.

252
00:15:16.341 --> 00:15:20.780
So 64% of no deals had some kind of math problem.
That was the biggest thing.

253
00:15:20.781 --> 00:15:23.930
But once you got past the math problem,
then we had a lot more room.

254
00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:26.630
When we talked about smiling,

255
00:15:26.631 --> 00:15:30.440
we found that 45% of successful entrepreneurs smiled while walking in.

256
00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:34.610
So that first impression smile seemed to be very important while only 21% of

257
00:15:34.611 --> 00:15:37.640
unsuccessful entrepreneurs did.
Interesting note here,

258
00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:42.230
but I think this speaks to a larger implication about smiling and about our

259
00:15:42.231 --> 00:15:43.250
facial expressions.

260
00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:47.360
We take a lot of cues about someone from their facial expressions,

261
00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:49.580
and I'm obsessed with the micro expression.

262
00:15:50.210 --> 00:15:55.130
So we used to believe that babies were born and learned facial expressions from

263
00:15:55.131 --> 00:15:56.990
their mom or dad.
So Ma,

264
00:15:57.020 --> 00:16:00.190
a baby would look at its mom or dad's face and then mirror it or [inaudible].

265
00:16:00.230 --> 00:16:02.150
And that's how babies learn to facial expressions.

266
00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:06.350
But actually what they found is congenitally blind babies,

267
00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:10.550
babies who have been blind since birth make the same facial expressions at the

268
00:16:10.551 --> 00:16:12.620
same time as seeing babies.

269
00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:18.500
This was a huge surprise in the body language community because we're thinking,

270
00:16:18.501 --> 00:16:20.570
well,
if you don't learn facial expressions,

271
00:16:20.571 --> 00:16:24.020
but we all seem to emote in the same way,
where are they coming from?

272
00:16:24.021 --> 00:16:29.021
Somehow how we express is coded and that means maybe we can study it.

273
00:16:29.930 --> 00:16:32.390
So Dr. Paul Ekman is the champion of this research.

274
00:16:32.391 --> 00:16:35.510
He's an incredible researcher and he discovered something called the micro

275
00:16:35.511 --> 00:16:36.344
expression.

276
00:16:36.590 --> 00:16:40.940
The micro expression is a very quick involuntary facial expression,

277
00:16:40.950 --> 00:16:45.320
but all of us make when we feel an intense emotion.
So this is across genders,

278
00:16:45.321 --> 00:16:48.620
across races.
He went to remote tribes in Papa New Guinea,

279
00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:52.790
showed them pictures of Americans making faces and ask them in their own

280
00:16:52.791 --> 00:16:54.090
language to describe the emotion.

281
00:16:54.090 --> 00:16:57.470
And they were able to pick the same emotions as Americans did when they saw the

282
00:16:57.471 --> 00:16:58.820
Papa New Guinea and space.

283
00:16:59.450 --> 00:17:02.420
So these are tribes that had never even been exposed to western culture,

284
00:17:02.421 --> 00:17:06.860
had never seen television before.
So how do we,
how does it benefit us?

285
00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:10.880
They had discovered there are seven universal facial expressions,

286
00:17:10.910 --> 00:17:15.320
and today I want to teach you to teach you four of my favorites.

287
00:17:15.830 --> 00:17:18.320
So the very first one,
smiling as we talked about earlier,

288
00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:21.800
smiling is the easiest one to talk about.
However,

289
00:17:22.130 --> 00:17:26.240
most people think that smiling is just a smile.
Happiness is just a smile,
right?

290
00:17:26.540 --> 00:17:29.990
But anyone knows that you can do a fake smile,
right?
That,
yeah,

291
00:17:29.991 --> 00:17:33.170
I'm so happy for you,
right?

292
00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:36.350
That smile on the bottom half of the face.
So when you look at the difference,

293
00:17:36.351 --> 00:17:41.000
you know real and a fake smile,
you see the difference.

294
00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:42.890
So real smiles,

295
00:17:42.891 --> 00:17:47.270
the only true indicator of happiness is when the smile reaches into these upper

296
00:17:47.271 --> 00:17:51.300
cheek muscles.
So this is the engagement of a real smile.

297
00:17:51.330 --> 00:17:53.700
You have to be able to physically see it in the eyes.

298
00:17:54.060 --> 00:17:59.060
Why this is important is because when we see fake smiles that comes across as

299
00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:02.180
inauthentic.
When you hear people talk about,
oh,

300
00:18:02.190 --> 00:18:04.800
she just seemed a little fake to me,
she little seem a little authentic.

301
00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:09.720
What you're actually picking up on is an incongruency that someone said they

302
00:18:09.721 --> 00:18:13.740
were happy for you or said they were happy but weren't actually showing that

303
00:18:13.741 --> 00:18:18.510
genuine happiness.
Next one's getting a little harder.

304
00:18:18.570 --> 00:18:20.190
So happiness was the easy one.
We got that out of the way.

305
00:18:20.191 --> 00:18:23.820
Now I'm going to test your skills.
What is this face?

306
00:18:23.821 --> 00:18:28.020
This is one of the seven universal facial expressions.
Surprise,
amused,

307
00:18:28.050 --> 00:18:32.160
curious or fear.
How many Hilton does this surprise?
A lot of you.

308
00:18:32.161 --> 00:18:36.420
How many who think this is amused?
How link this is.
Curious.

309
00:18:37.230 --> 00:18:38.820
And how many of you think this is fear?

310
00:18:39.990 --> 00:18:44.280
So this one is the universal micro expression for fear surprises a different

311
00:18:44.281 --> 00:18:46.470
micro expression.
That's one of the seven.
But this is not it.

312
00:18:46.980 --> 00:18:51.330
This surprises most people,
most people guest surprise.

313
00:18:51.780 --> 00:18:55.230
So when we talk about fear,
I like this microaggression.

314
00:18:55.231 --> 00:19:00.231
I like starting with it because this face keeps us the safest in terms of

315
00:19:01.891 --> 00:19:06.470
danger.
Let me explain how this works.
So when you look at the fear,

316
00:19:06.490 --> 00:19:07.860
micro expression and action,

317
00:19:08.190 --> 00:19:12.060
let's say that I'm hiking and all of a sudden I see a snake,

318
00:19:12.570 --> 00:19:16.470
my eyelids and my eyebrows jumped out of the way so I can take in as much of the

319
00:19:16.471 --> 00:19:20.190
environment as possible.
Is there another snake and what's my escape route?

320
00:19:20.700 --> 00:19:25.410
Then my mouth opens.
I take an oxygen in case I have to fight,

321
00:19:25.740 --> 00:19:29.640
flee,
or yell for help.
This face,
and you can try it with me if you want.

322
00:19:29.641 --> 00:19:32.100
If you raise your eyebrows up and widen your eyes,
very good,

323
00:19:32.101 --> 00:19:33.750
you'll actually begin to feel a little anxious.

324
00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:39.000
And the reason for that is because of something called the facial feedback

325
00:19:39.001 --> 00:19:39.840
hypothesis.

326
00:19:39.930 --> 00:19:44.430
So what they found is that our emotions are feedback loops.

327
00:19:44.850 --> 00:19:48.930
We don't only feel the emotion which causes the face if we make the face,

328
00:19:48.931 --> 00:19:53.430
but also helps us feel the emotion.
This is the basis of empathy.

329
00:19:54.270 --> 00:19:57.630
When you get on a subway car and you see someone make this face,

330
00:19:58.650 --> 00:20:02.550
you immediately make that face as well.
What's going on?
What's happening right?

331
00:20:02.551 --> 00:20:05.520
You immediately begin to feel fear before you even know what happens.

332
00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:08.280
That is your body's way of protecting you.

333
00:20:09.570 --> 00:20:12.210
Why I think this is so helpful in business environments,

334
00:20:12.211 --> 00:20:14.070
not just for walking down a subway car,

335
00:20:14.071 --> 00:20:19.071
seeing snakes is because you see fear all the time in business environments.

336
00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:21.870
You mentioned something that confuses someone.

337
00:20:22.260 --> 00:20:23.640
You mentioned something that they didn't know.

338
00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:26.370
You've done a piece of information that makes them uncomfortable.

339
00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:30.420
You put them in an uncomfortable situation.
They will flash fear at you.

340
00:20:30.660 --> 00:20:33.510
We know what we're looking for and we're just looking for the whites of

341
00:20:33.511 --> 00:20:36.450
someone's eyes.
You will see that flicker all the time.

342
00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:41.760
That gives you so much information.
The moment you spot someone's fear,

343
00:20:41.761 --> 00:20:42.780
you have a choice.

344
00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:46.950
You can either keep it tucked away inside or piece of information,

345
00:20:47.020 --> 00:20:51.370
which is always helpful or you can choose to address it and and sued them.

346
00:20:51.430 --> 00:20:55.360
Call them,
reassure them,
here are your choices.
When it comes to fear.
One,

347
00:20:55.450 --> 00:20:57.010
you can give them reassurance,
right?

348
00:20:57.011 --> 00:20:58.570
If something you said made them uncomfortable,

349
00:20:58.571 --> 00:21:02.230
you're in a pitch or trying to sell an idea and someone flickered fear at you.

350
00:21:02.380 --> 00:21:03.940
Maybe you said something that was confusing.

351
00:21:04.210 --> 00:21:06.910
Maybe you said something that they mistook as something threatening,

352
00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:10.540
so you can go into reassurance.
You can also just go into more explanation.

353
00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:13.990
Since we tend to be afraid,
when we are confused,

354
00:21:14.020 --> 00:21:16.810
sometimes more verbal explanation will calm the fear,

355
00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:19.900
just having more understanding and lastly,

356
00:21:19.930 --> 00:21:23.380
you being calm and confident also can soothe their fear.

357
00:21:24.370 --> 00:21:27.640
Let's go onto the next one.
What does this face mean?

358
00:21:29.350 --> 00:21:33.520
Choices are discussed,
suspicion,
anger,
and sadness.

359
00:21:33.550 --> 00:21:35.200
How many of you think of this is discussed?

360
00:21:35.980 --> 00:21:37.750
How many would think this is suspicion?

361
00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:40.990
How do we think this is anger?

362
00:21:42.040 --> 00:21:46.540
How many people think this is sadness?
So this is anger.
And by the way,

363
00:21:46.541 --> 00:21:49.530
if you raise your hand suspicion,
I'm going to give that to you also.
Um,

364
00:21:49.540 --> 00:21:52.450
and the reason for that,
I'm gonna explain in a second.
So this is anger.

365
00:21:52.510 --> 00:21:54.280
Anger is real easy and we actually try it with me.

366
00:21:54.281 --> 00:21:57.610
So I'm need to pull your eyebrows down to these two vertical lines appear very

367
00:21:57.611 --> 00:22:02.170
good.
Now hold it for a second.
Squint your lower eyes at me and harden your lips.

368
00:22:02.620 --> 00:22:06.580
You will begin to feel real irritated.
Don't do it for too long,
okay?

369
00:22:06.581 --> 00:22:08.140
Wipe it away.
Wipe it away.
By the way,
why?
Of the why

370
00:22:09.970 --> 00:22:12.760
and that is because that feeling of like,
ah,

371
00:22:13.030 --> 00:22:15.460
that is the face that we make when we have that emotion.

372
00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:19.150
What you're looking for in the workplace is those two vertical lines.

373
00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:21.310
The moment you see those two vertical lines,

374
00:22:21.311 --> 00:22:23.620
you know that that person is starting to bubble and anger.

375
00:22:24.010 --> 00:22:27.970
I also want you to look for the lower lids.
So very weird tip,

376
00:22:27.971 --> 00:22:30.820
but it's really protected me against some bad deals.

377
00:22:31.870 --> 00:22:35.320
The sister emotion to anger is suspicion.

378
00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:38.350
Suspicion is a really important one to spot.

379
00:22:38.380 --> 00:22:42.280
And suspicion happens when someone lowers their lids,
the titans,
they're lower.

380
00:22:42.281 --> 00:22:44.920
Lindsey,
I'm going to show you what that looks like.
So watch my face.
I'm,

381
00:22:44.921 --> 00:22:45.910
I'll type my lower eyelids

382
00:22:48.220 --> 00:22:50.500
right when I do that.

383
00:22:50.501 --> 00:22:53.460
You are seeing that even though it's a very micro gesture.

384
00:22:53.500 --> 00:22:56.350
Can you guys see that in the back there?
If I per,
okay.
A little bit.

385
00:22:56.380 --> 00:22:58.300
It's when I type in my lower lid.
You can try that with each other.

386
00:22:58.480 --> 00:23:02.020
So even all the way back there,
they can see it.
That is because as humans,

387
00:23:02.021 --> 00:23:04.660
we like to know.
If someone does not believe us,

388
00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:08.890
even all the way in the back corners of the room,
you can see when I'm like,

389
00:23:08.891 --> 00:23:12.430
I don't think so.
In fact,
I can see when you're doing that to me.

390
00:23:14.770 --> 00:23:16.930
So when I go into further explanation,

391
00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:20.380
it's because I'm seeing more than one suspicious face in the audience.

392
00:23:20.950 --> 00:23:23.770
You can do this even if you're in front of a huge crowd or one on one.

393
00:23:23.771 --> 00:23:27.850
So I want you to watch out for those lower lids hardening cause you're not done

394
00:23:27.851 --> 00:23:30.340
selling yet.
You're not done explaining yet.

395
00:23:30.670 --> 00:23:33.820
That's one of the most interesting power tips I can give you on micro

396
00:23:33.821 --> 00:23:37.240
expressions.
So what do you do when you see anger or suspicion?
One,

397
00:23:38.290 --> 00:23:40.300
it is our instinct as humans,

398
00:23:40.301 --> 00:23:44.410
we cannot help it that when someone flashes anger at us,

399
00:23:44.411 --> 00:23:49.160
we either flip into the [inaudible],
right or we go into the defensive.

400
00:23:49.220 --> 00:23:53.660
It's either not my fault or it's all your fault.
So it's really important.

401
00:23:53.661 --> 00:23:58.550
If you want to stop their anger from happening is to stay as neutral as
possible.

402
00:23:58.551 --> 00:24:02.030
Don't follow that instinct right away to go the offensive or defensive.

403
00:24:02.360 --> 00:24:06.680
Try to figure out what is the source of this anger.
It might not actually be you,

404
00:24:06.740 --> 00:24:08.960
it could be something else,
something beyond your control.

405
00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:12.230
What is the source of that anger?
And then lastly,

406
00:24:12.231 --> 00:24:14.810
trying to figure out how you can highlight cooperation.

407
00:24:15.470 --> 00:24:18.740
If you can figure out what the source of anger is and that you can actually help

408
00:24:18.741 --> 00:24:21.950
them solve it or get through it or talk through it,

409
00:24:22.220 --> 00:24:25.820
then you are not the source of the anger.
You're more of an ally against it.

410
00:24:26.420 --> 00:24:31.130
So that can help you get prevent a no or a miscommunication from happening
later.

411
00:24:32.570 --> 00:24:35.990
I want to briefly go into the power personality ties in really well.

412
00:24:35.991 --> 00:24:38.630
People often ask me at this point in the presentation,
you know,

413
00:24:38.631 --> 00:24:41.180
what else would I see these with my colleagues?

414
00:24:41.181 --> 00:24:42.680
When am I going to see anger or fear?

415
00:24:42.681 --> 00:24:47.030
They seem like such intense emotions in the workplace and this brings me to some

416
00:24:47.031 --> 00:24:49.910
of the differences are wired differences in personality,

417
00:24:50.600 --> 00:24:52.370
so I'm fascinated by personality.

418
00:24:52.370 --> 00:24:55.370
We have a whole chapter on it in the book because I think that it is one of the

419
00:24:55.371 --> 00:24:57.710
most fundamental aspects of our communication.

420
00:24:58.220 --> 00:25:00.800
The biggest thing that I want you to think about is that a lot of our

421
00:25:00.801 --> 00:25:03.050
personality is not a choice.

422
00:25:04.460 --> 00:25:09.460
Specifically 35 to 50% of our personality is genetic and a lot of the rest of it

423
00:25:10.011 --> 00:25:13.970
is formed in our childhoods,
the time we get here and the workplace.

424
00:25:14.150 --> 00:25:16.880
Our personality is pretty inflexible.

425
00:25:17.270 --> 00:25:21.140
This is a really interesting computer rendering of an introvert face versus an

426
00:25:21.141 --> 00:25:22.190
extrovert face,

427
00:25:22.670 --> 00:25:26.990
which actually shows you that there's some tie between our hormones are

428
00:25:26.991 --> 00:25:31.820
pheromones are facial development and our wiring,
our personality traits.

429
00:25:32.270 --> 00:25:34.160
By the way,
who,
which one do you think you look more like?

430
00:25:34.161 --> 00:25:35.510
Do you think that fits your first not and don't worry.

431
00:25:35.511 --> 00:25:36.540
I won't ask you to raise your hand,

432
00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:39.770
but I always think it's interesting to see if it compares to your face.

433
00:25:40.250 --> 00:25:41.930
So when we talk about personality science,

434
00:25:41.931 --> 00:25:43.370
I'm not going to go into all the details today.

435
00:25:43.371 --> 00:25:47.960
They're the only personality science that's used in academia,
Myers Briggs,

436
00:25:48.020 --> 00:25:51.410
enneagram disc.
Those are great paradigms.

437
00:25:51.411 --> 00:25:53.630
They are not backed up in real science.

438
00:25:54.050 --> 00:25:57.350
The only personality science that's actually used in academia,

439
00:25:57.351 --> 00:26:02.180
it's called the big five and that is these five personality traits,
extroversion,

440
00:26:02.181 --> 00:26:05.390
conscientiousness,
neuroticism,
openness and agreeableness.

441
00:26:05.990 --> 00:26:09.620
I want to talk about two of them today because I think that these two are the

442
00:26:09.621 --> 00:26:14.120
reasons why you see a lot of anger and fear and contempt in the workplace.

443
00:26:14.750 --> 00:26:17.120
Specifically.
Let's talk about conscientiousness first.

444
00:26:17.150 --> 00:26:21.800
So all of us rank either high or low and our personality traits,

445
00:26:22.250 --> 00:26:26.300
so people who are high in conscientiousness,
it's how we focused on details.

446
00:26:26.510 --> 00:26:28.670
A lot of engineers are typically high in conscientiousness.

447
00:26:28.671 --> 00:26:32.450
I just did a training at Intel,
very,
very high conscientious group.

448
00:26:32.870 --> 00:26:37.250
They are called focused.
They love details,
steps,

449
00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:41.150
lists,
schedules.
I like to go in order.
They like to have agendas.

450
00:26:42.020 --> 00:26:46.910
Low conscientious are called flexible.
They much prefer big ideas.

451
00:26:46.911 --> 00:26:51.480
I like to be easy going schedules,
make them feel boxed in.
They like to have,

452
00:26:51.530 --> 00:26:55.050
they don't like lists.
Lists make them feel like they can't be creative enough.

453
00:26:55.800 --> 00:26:59.040
We are wired either be high or low.

454
00:26:59.041 --> 00:27:01.260
How would you feel like they are high in conscientiousness?

455
00:27:01.261 --> 00:27:03.330
They love details and lists.
Civics,

456
00:27:04.110 --> 00:27:08.190
humbling that they are low in conscientiousness.
And lastly,

457
00:27:08.191 --> 00:27:08.851
how many of you people,

458
00:27:08.851 --> 00:27:13.800
PR people feel like you can flip into both if you need to?
Okay,

459
00:27:13.801 --> 00:27:18.420
so as adults we also develop this skill.
This is less,
we do this as kids,

460
00:27:18.421 --> 00:27:21.780
as adults who develop this really great skill where in the right situation we

461
00:27:21.781 --> 00:27:26.460
can dial up or dial down our personality.
Depending on where we need to go.

462
00:27:26.590 --> 00:27:28.740
I actually think leveraging that is incredibly important.

463
00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:32.070
So what I want us to think about for conscientiousness is a couple of things.

464
00:27:33.060 --> 00:27:35.580
One,
with the people you work with,

465
00:27:35.670 --> 00:27:39.330
are they the same as your conscientiousness level or they different?

466
00:27:40.260 --> 00:27:43.560
The biggest problem that I seen workplace,
when you see anger most,

467
00:27:43.590 --> 00:27:47.880
it's when a really high conscientious person has a whole detailed project plan.

468
00:27:48.030 --> 00:27:51.960
Lots of phases,
tons of lists.
They bring the product to someone and they say,

469
00:27:52.140 --> 00:27:55.170
here's this huge project and the low conscientious person is like,

470
00:27:56.010 --> 00:28:00.210
just what's the big idea here?
Just to give me the,
just a couple couple,

471
00:28:00.211 --> 00:28:01.410
couple bullet points on this.

472
00:28:01.950 --> 00:28:04.710
And the low conscientious person pill feels overwhelmed,

473
00:28:04.711 --> 00:28:07.860
but all the details or the high content of the person feels like their work is

474
00:28:07.861 --> 00:28:10.140
not being taken advantage of or not being appreciated.

475
00:28:10.710 --> 00:28:13.740
So I want you to think about the people you work with and where they fall on the

476
00:28:13.741 --> 00:28:17.700
spectrum.
How would they most like to be pitched?
Second,

477
00:28:18.300 --> 00:28:21.060
when you talk about pitching,
what is the best way to approach them?

478
00:28:21.061 --> 00:28:24.840
So a high conscientious person,
they love agendas on calls.

479
00:28:24.870 --> 00:28:28.560
They like scheduled meetings.
They're like thing when people show up on time,

480
00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:32.040
whereas low content,
just people that feels like the,
that's boxing them in.

481
00:28:32.490 --> 00:28:35.160
So if you want to approach them on something really important,

482
00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:38.430
how can you do it according to their personality traits?

483
00:28:39.150 --> 00:28:41.520
I've always liked the golden rule,
right?
Treat.

484
00:28:41.560 --> 00:28:45.030
We know the golden rule is treat others and imagery.

485
00:28:45.180 --> 00:28:48.510
So I have a funny story just briefly.
So I asked that to an audience a few weeks.

486
00:28:48.511 --> 00:28:51.520
Go and sell Conn valley and it was a lot of millennials.
I'm a millennial,

487
00:28:51.521 --> 00:28:54.690
so that's great.
But there's a lot of millennials.
I said,
so the golden rule is,

488
00:28:54.691 --> 00:28:57.060
and someone said,
I am awesome.

489
00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:02.430
And I was like,
that's not the golden rule,

490
00:29:02.431 --> 00:29:05.970
but good job.
Nice try.

491
00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:10.140
So I prefer what's called the platinum rule.

492
00:29:10.141 --> 00:29:13.230
The platinum rule is treat others the way they would want to be treated.

493
00:29:13.890 --> 00:29:17.910
So this is how I go about my work interactions.
Yes,

494
00:29:17.911 --> 00:29:19.530
I know my own personality traits,

495
00:29:19.560 --> 00:29:23.280
but I would much rather have a lens of their personality traits.

496
00:29:23.380 --> 00:29:27.960
So I am speaking to them where they come from,
I'm meeting them where they're at.

497
00:29:28.350 --> 00:29:31.350
So we see a lot of anger when there's a mismatch,
right?

498
00:29:31.351 --> 00:29:34.290
We see a lot of anger when you are pitching a low contents or a high

499
00:29:34.291 --> 00:29:36.780
conscientious person that's opposite from you.
And lastly,

500
00:29:36.781 --> 00:29:40.440
which I'm going to ask for every single one of these is what could you do to

501
00:29:40.441 --> 00:29:43.420
respect their level of conscientiousness?
If you had to,

502
00:29:43.450 --> 00:29:45.940
if you had the dial up or dial down,
could you?

503
00:29:48.190 --> 00:29:51.610
The next one I want to talk about when we see a lot of emotional emotional

504
00:29:51.611 --> 00:29:55.120
changes is neuroticism.
So neuroticism gets a really bad rap.

505
00:29:55.330 --> 00:29:57.370
Whenever I ask people,
are you high neurotic?

506
00:30:00.760 --> 00:30:03.280
You were in the front,
you didn't see no one rose.
Their hand raised their hands.

507
00:30:03.290 --> 00:30:07.420
But I am neurotic with you.
So neuroticism always gets a really bad rap.

508
00:30:08.410 --> 00:30:09.870
But I want to explain something that neuroticism,

509
00:30:09.990 --> 00:30:14.470
I am a high neurotic and there is a chemical explanation for this.

510
00:30:14.710 --> 00:30:19.710
So researchers looked at high neurotics and they found that many of them carry a

511
00:30:20.891 --> 00:30:23.140
long form of a certain gene.

512
00:30:23.770 --> 00:30:26.620
This gene is a serotonin transport gene.
Now,

513
00:30:26.621 --> 00:30:30.940
Serotonin is a really important chemical for us.
Simply basically,

514
00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:32.380
it kind of keeps us calm.

515
00:30:32.920 --> 00:30:36.400
So let's say that you are driving to work and you almost get into a car
accident.

516
00:30:37.170 --> 00:30:39.850
Someone almost hits you.
They don't,
they almost do.
And you're like,
oh,

517
00:30:40.630 --> 00:30:43.540
you have adrenaline,
you have cortisol,
you're really anxious.

518
00:30:43.750 --> 00:30:48.370
Serotonin is what comes into your body and says,
you're fine.
You're okay,

519
00:30:48.700 --> 00:30:49.750
and then calms you down.

520
00:30:50.500 --> 00:30:55.500
A neurotic person transports and produces serotonin faster,

521
00:30:56.830 --> 00:31:01.000
meaning something bad happens to them.
They freak out and they go,

522
00:31:01.670 --> 00:31:06.580
oh,
it'll all be okay.
A high neurotic person,
we,

523
00:31:06.581 --> 00:31:11.581
something bad happens to us and we are freaked out for a long time because our

524
00:31:11.981 --> 00:31:16.160
serotonin just takes a little bit longer to go.
So my lovely husband,
who's alone,

525
00:31:16.170 --> 00:31:21.100
neurotic,
radical,
say it's fine and two alone neurotic.
It's fine.

526
00:31:21.101 --> 00:31:22.720
Sounds like you're not worrying enough.

527
00:31:22.721 --> 00:31:24.760
So I better worry enough for the both of us.

528
00:31:26.380 --> 00:31:28.180
That's how a high neurotic feels about it.

529
00:31:28.540 --> 00:31:32.320
So high neurotics not only produce less Serotonin,

530
00:31:32.500 --> 00:31:37.000
but they also have a greater physiological response to negative events.

531
00:31:37.810 --> 00:31:42.520
So if you go into a high neurotics office with a small piece of bad news,

532
00:31:42.640 --> 00:31:45.250
not a huge piece,
small piece of bad news,
you go in,

533
00:31:45.251 --> 00:31:46.570
you present it and then you go,

534
00:31:46.900 --> 00:31:51.900
you might have left that high neurotic in a state of panic and they might stay

535
00:31:52.211 --> 00:31:56.530
that way for many,
many hours.
And when you reach out to them later,

536
00:31:56.531 --> 00:32:00.370
call them later,
slack them later.
And I'm,
do you guys use slack or Google?
No,

537
00:32:00.520 --> 00:32:02.970
maybe chat.
Chat.

538
00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:06.970
You chat with them later and they're still kind of salty.

539
00:32:07.510 --> 00:32:10.840
It's because they're still recovering.
Serotonin wise,
not bad news.

540
00:32:10.841 --> 00:32:12.070
You dumped on their desk earlier.

541
00:32:12.590 --> 00:32:15.520
So I want you to think about when it comes to neuroticism,

542
00:32:16.060 --> 00:32:18.250
how can you work with your high neurotics?

543
00:32:18.460 --> 00:32:21.010
My high neurotics in the room you are called reactive.

544
00:32:21.820 --> 00:32:24.610
So high neurotics have much more emotional fluidity.

545
00:32:24.611 --> 00:32:26.530
We have high moods and low mood.

546
00:32:26.530 --> 00:32:29.260
That's cause we often will catch the moves of the people that we're with.

547
00:32:29.470 --> 00:32:32.980
And if something even slightly bad happens to us,
it lasts a lot longer.

548
00:32:34.330 --> 00:32:38.010
We're also,
because we're such worse because we have a greater response,

549
00:32:38.030 --> 00:32:38.863
negative events,

550
00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:43.250
we try very hard to prevent those negative events from happening in the first

551
00:32:43.251 --> 00:32:46.760
place.
I think this is a good thing.
In fact,

552
00:32:46.761 --> 00:32:49.610
you have to have a high and low neurotic on your team.

553
00:32:50.060 --> 00:32:53.990
Your low neurotics are resilient,
so low neurotics,

554
00:32:54.050 --> 00:32:57.380
very little mood change.
You're almost always the same,
same mood.

555
00:32:57.620 --> 00:32:59.690
You don't catch other people's emotions very easily.

556
00:32:59.840 --> 00:33:03.800
You can always kind of see the bright side of things or at least the realistic

557
00:33:03.801 --> 00:33:06.950
side of things depending on up here,
optimistic or pessimistic.

558
00:33:06.990 --> 00:33:08.570
Someone got my joke.
Woo.

559
00:33:09.470 --> 00:33:12.530
So I'm just curious how many people think that they're a high neurotic?

560
00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:16.100
Love you guys.
Okay.
How many of you are alone?
Erotic?

561
00:33:16.730 --> 00:33:18.290
I love you guys too because you are my rocks.

562
00:33:18.320 --> 00:33:19.700
How he will think that you're in the middle.

563
00:33:19.701 --> 00:33:22.370
You kind of flipped depending on where you are home or at work.

564
00:33:23.120 --> 00:33:27.200
It is extremely important to know where you fall on the neuroticism spectrum.

565
00:33:27.470 --> 00:33:30.530
Why you want to have both on your team,

566
00:33:31.130 --> 00:33:33.800
your low neurotics get you through crisis.

567
00:33:34.220 --> 00:33:38.330
They're the ones who have a nice calm head.
They can think real logically.

568
00:33:38.360 --> 00:33:40.700
They're really good to have if something's going wrong.

569
00:33:41.270 --> 00:33:45.560
But your high neurotics prevent the crisis from happening in the first place.

570
00:33:46.310 --> 00:33:50.570
They're the ones who sit at their desk playing.
What if,
what if?
What if?

571
00:33:51.650 --> 00:33:53.360
My high neurotics you know what I'm talking about.

572
00:33:53.361 --> 00:33:55.220
We make those pros and cons lists,
right?

573
00:33:55.221 --> 00:33:59.000
We think like months and months of bad events in the future just in case that

574
00:33:59.001 --> 00:33:59.834
could happen.

575
00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:03.830
So it's really important that you leverage both of those strengths and you know

576
00:34:03.831 --> 00:34:07.820
who to call depending on where you are.
Want to have a brainstorming session,

577
00:34:07.850 --> 00:34:10.700
one to prevent or protect anything bad from happening.

578
00:34:10.730 --> 00:34:14.330
Call a high neurotic into the room.
You're having a crisis.

579
00:34:14.780 --> 00:34:18.170
You want to stay calm and get through it.
Call your loan.
Neurotic,
right?

580
00:34:18.171 --> 00:34:19.130
Those are your rocks.

581
00:34:19.710 --> 00:34:23.390
So here are a couple of specific things I want to ask about yourself as well as

582
00:34:23.391 --> 00:34:27.560
the people on your team.
One,
how do they self calm?

583
00:34:28.220 --> 00:34:31.400
So everyone's self sues in different ways.

584
00:34:31.730 --> 00:34:36.730
Some high neurotics calm by verbalizing they want to come into your office to

585
00:34:36.921 --> 00:34:40.850
come by your desk and just verbalize out loud forever until they're calm.

586
00:34:41.870 --> 00:34:46.340
Others completely shut down and want to process by themselves.

587
00:34:46.670 --> 00:34:48.800
They don't want to talk to you.
They didn't want to touch anyone.

588
00:34:48.920 --> 00:34:51.830
They just want to self process the best.

589
00:34:51.831 --> 00:34:56.390
The greatest gift I think we can give to our fellow human beings is by helping

590
00:34:56.391 --> 00:34:58.730
them self calm in their natural way.

591
00:34:59.480 --> 00:35:02.690
So if you know that someone's a verbalizer and they've had a really bad day or

592
00:35:02.691 --> 00:35:05.990
you just had bad news,
the greatest gift you can give them is to go and be like,

593
00:35:05.991 --> 00:35:08.720
Hey,
no,
let's go for a walk.
Let's go talk this thing out.

594
00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:13.370
Whereas if you have a high neurotic who self columns by just totally shutting

595
00:35:13.371 --> 00:35:15.860
down,
you say,
Hey,
you know what?
I'm going to give you some space.

596
00:35:15.890 --> 00:35:17.720
I'm going to check in later.
Why don't you,
uh,

597
00:35:17.750 --> 00:35:20.090
go take some time and let me know when you're ready to talk.

598
00:35:20.630 --> 00:35:25.040
Those are two very different responses that respect how they are wired.
Next?

599
00:35:25.430 --> 00:35:27.470
What do they worry about and how do they worry?

600
00:35:27.830 --> 00:35:32.750
So all neurotics have certain things that get them triggered,
triggers,

601
00:35:32.780 --> 00:35:34.850
you know,
we have those things that really get us going.

602
00:35:35.090 --> 00:35:38.790
It's also very helpful for both.
Low on hydronics to know what do we worry about,

603
00:35:38.791 --> 00:35:42.150
what triggers us and how do we worried we were out loud?

604
00:35:42.180 --> 00:35:45.090
Do we worry by ourselves?
Do we seek friends?

605
00:35:45.300 --> 00:35:49.800
So do you seek camaraderie and community when you're in your worrying stage or

606
00:35:49.950 --> 00:35:53.400
do you want solitude and quiet?
And lastly,

607
00:35:53.430 --> 00:35:57.900
what else can you do to respect their level of neuroticism?
How about this one?

608
00:35:58.200 --> 00:36:02.280
Back to micro expressions.
What does this face mean?
Confusion,
contempt,

609
00:36:02.281 --> 00:36:04.590
sarcasm or board on.
How do you think it's confusion?

610
00:36:05.580 --> 00:36:10.470
How many people think it's contempt?
How many people think it's sarcasm?

611
00:36:11.550 --> 00:36:15.210
How many whole thing?
It's boredom.
This one,

612
00:36:15.240 --> 00:36:19.170
most people get wrong.
This is the universal expression for contempt.

613
00:36:19.200 --> 00:36:20.490
Most people guess board,

614
00:36:20.491 --> 00:36:24.480
and we actually have had I think 22,000 people take this quiz on our website.

615
00:36:24.690 --> 00:36:28.680
And most people guess boredom.
This is very dangerous.

616
00:36:29.130 --> 00:36:33.930
Contempt is an extremely negative micro expression.
It's also the simplest,

617
00:36:33.931 --> 00:36:37.170
it's a one sided mouth race to kind of see what you look at one side of your

618
00:36:37.171 --> 00:36:38.190
mouth up either side.

619
00:36:39.240 --> 00:36:43.050
It's a very pessimistic scornful kind of micro expression.

620
00:36:43.860 --> 00:36:48.180
The reason why it's important actually has to do with I think the best way to

621
00:36:48.181 --> 00:36:50.780
assess this with a research that was done by Dr John Gottman,

622
00:36:50.781 --> 00:36:55.710
so Dr John Gottman is actually here in Seattle and he did a massive experiment

623
00:36:55.740 --> 00:36:59.070
with married couples,
analyzed thousands of married couples,

624
00:36:59.071 --> 00:37:04.071
follow them for many years and he found that one of the biggest indicators of

625
00:37:04.741 --> 00:37:09.741
divorce was when one of the couples showed contempt towards the other.

626
00:37:10.170 --> 00:37:10.681
In fact,

627
00:37:10.681 --> 00:37:15.681
he can predict with 93.6% accuracy if a couple we'll get divorced within 30

628
00:37:16.921 --> 00:37:20.190
years by watching a silent video of a couple.

629
00:37:20.970 --> 00:37:23.130
What he is looking for is contempt.

630
00:37:24.390 --> 00:37:29.130
Contempt is powerful because it's the only emotion that doesn't go away of all

631
00:37:29.131 --> 00:37:32.910
the micro expressions.
Fear comes in a burst,
you self sooth.

632
00:37:33.300 --> 00:37:35.280
Anger comes all at once.
You calm down,

633
00:37:35.281 --> 00:37:40.110
happiness comes and you go back to neutral but not contempt.
Contempt.

634
00:37:40.111 --> 00:37:41.310
If it's not addressed,

635
00:37:41.340 --> 00:37:46.230
it's sits and it festers and it grows and it grows in a disrespect.

636
00:37:46.680 --> 00:37:48.960
And that's why at the end of a very bad marriage,

637
00:37:48.961 --> 00:37:51.570
you get people who can't even look each other in the eye.

638
00:37:52.260 --> 00:37:55.680
So when you seek contempt,
especially on a colleague's face,

639
00:37:56.010 --> 00:37:58.050
you have to address it immediately.

640
00:37:58.051 --> 00:37:59.940
So here are the things that I like to do when I see it.

641
00:38:00.630 --> 00:38:03.240
One figuring out exactly where it's coming from.

642
00:38:03.300 --> 00:38:06.030
So it might not be something you said,
it could be some self contempt,

643
00:38:06.031 --> 00:38:08.910
could be summit they are working through.
Second,

644
00:38:09.270 --> 00:38:14.270
how can you make sure that you are an ally against it as opposed to an enemy of

645
00:38:14.911 --> 00:38:18.450
it.
So whenever I see contempt on someone's face,

646
00:38:18.451 --> 00:38:21.480
whether I'm in a negotiation or a pitch meeting or an interview,

647
00:38:21.750 --> 00:38:24.990
I will always say,
are we all good?
Does it all make sense?

648
00:38:25.080 --> 00:38:28.680
Anything you want me to review or retake?
You know what?
Let's pause.

649
00:38:28.690 --> 00:38:29.610
Let's rewind for a second.

650
00:38:29.611 --> 00:38:32.610
I'm going to go back over this to see if I see it again.

651
00:38:33.900 --> 00:38:37.150
I give them the opportunity to verbally tell me if something's bothering them.

652
00:38:37.270 --> 00:38:39.160
And,
or I will go back,

653
00:38:39.550 --> 00:38:42.550
retrace my steps and see does it pop up yet again?

654
00:38:43.450 --> 00:38:48.010
This kind of protects us against nasty miscommunications that can happen down

655
00:38:48.011 --> 00:38:50.740
the line by watching out for this expression.

656
00:38:50.741 --> 00:38:54.550
It's a subtle way of checking in with someone emotionally.

657
00:38:54.580 --> 00:38:56.230
It's like taking their emotional temperature.

658
00:38:56.460 --> 00:38:59.320
So then that watching out for this contempt is incredibly important.

659
00:39:00.010 --> 00:39:02.410
One last one I want to teach you before I show you another video.

660
00:39:03.460 --> 00:39:06.760
So the choices are amused,
discussed,
upset,
and embarrassed.

661
00:39:06.761 --> 00:39:10.690
How many living this is amused.
How many of them think this is discussed?

662
00:39:11.380 --> 00:39:15.190
How can this is upset?
How could,
this is embarrassed?

663
00:39:16.180 --> 00:39:21.100
So this is the universal expression for disgust.
Now this is kind of a funny one.

664
00:39:21.101 --> 00:39:24.400
So people always like,
Vanessa,
why do I have to know,
discuss,

665
00:39:24.401 --> 00:39:27.190
I don't care if they don't like the food or something smells bad,

666
00:39:27.191 --> 00:39:30.640
but I want to actually make this space for me.
So pull your nose up.
Very good.

667
00:39:30.670 --> 00:39:32.970
Flash the EPR,
whites of your teeth at me.
And uh,

668
00:39:34.180 --> 00:39:38.440
that is the face that you make.
We something smells really bad.

669
00:39:39.100 --> 00:39:44.100
The other time that we make the disgust face is we're trying to think of a nice

670
00:39:44.561 --> 00:39:46.720
way to say something that we don't like.

671
00:39:48.340 --> 00:39:50.650
Ask someone any preference based question.

672
00:39:50.651 --> 00:39:54.100
They're trying to think of a polite way to say no,
they look like this.
So,
uh,

673
00:39:54.101 --> 00:39:58.750
what do you think of the new girl?
Yeah,
she's great.
Yeah.

674
00:40:00.790 --> 00:40:05.680
So that discussed can sometimes indicate that something is going on beneath the

675
00:40:05.681 --> 00:40:09.040
surface.
So last one discussed.

676
00:40:09.220 --> 00:40:14.220
If you see it identified the problem immediately and give them permission to

677
00:40:14.231 --> 00:40:16.090
tell you the truth,
right?

678
00:40:16.091 --> 00:40:19.000
Give them permission to say come out and say whatever it is that's bothering

679
00:40:19.001 --> 00:40:22.120
them.
So why facial expressions?

680
00:40:22.121 --> 00:40:24.340
Obviously I think it helps us to code hidden emotions,

681
00:40:24.341 --> 00:40:27.550
which is a lot of information for your bag of tricks.
Second,

682
00:40:27.551 --> 00:40:29.650
it also helps us respond in the right way.

683
00:40:30.250 --> 00:40:32.800
A lot of you raised your hands at the wrong emotions.

684
00:40:32.830 --> 00:40:36.640
That's cause we're not as intuitively good at spotting microexpressions as we

685
00:40:36.641 --> 00:40:39.130
would like.
So if you know what you're seeing,

686
00:40:39.131 --> 00:40:43.690
it helps you respond in the right way.
We often confuse anger for fear,

687
00:40:43.990 --> 00:40:48.250
but there could not be more of a different emotional internal state for that

688
00:40:48.251 --> 00:40:53.251
person or we can confuse contempt for boredom and those are two extremely

689
00:40:53.711 --> 00:40:56.620
different emotions,
so making sure that you're responding in the right way.

690
00:40:57.070 --> 00:41:01.840
I also think that reading people's micro expressions helps you listen to someone

691
00:41:01.841 --> 00:41:06.580
on a totally new level.
We are never listened to with that kind of attention,

692
00:41:07.030 --> 00:41:10.270
right?
To actually put down our phones and not only be listening with our ears,

693
00:41:10.271 --> 00:41:12.850
but actually listening with our eyes and reading them because we're trying to

694
00:41:12.851 --> 00:41:16.510
figure out really what's going on for them I think is one of the most amazing

695
00:41:16.511 --> 00:41:17.530
ways to respond.

696
00:41:18.430 --> 00:41:22.660
I want to end on a quick story and I think when I have time for a few questions

697
00:41:22.661 --> 00:41:23.800
before I do book signing.

698
00:41:24.410 --> 00:41:28.210
Famous story of Benjamin Disraeli and William Gladstone and this is how I like

699
00:41:28.211 --> 00:41:29.200
things.
My Interactions,

700
00:41:29.740 --> 00:41:32.830
both of these gentlemen were running for prime minister of the UK many,

701
00:41:32.831 --> 00:41:36.110
many years ago and it was a contentious race.

702
00:41:36.140 --> 00:41:40.400
They were extremely close in the polls and the week before the election,

703
00:41:40.430 --> 00:41:45.430
a journalist took both men out to lunch and everyone was following these

704
00:41:45.891 --> 00:41:49.700
lunches.
Everyone wanted to see who would the journalist pick,
who did she,

705
00:41:49.701 --> 00:41:52.280
who is she more charmed by?
At the end of these lunches,

706
00:41:52.810 --> 00:41:55.850
and at the end of both of these lunches,
she wrote a big article about them.

707
00:41:56.240 --> 00:42:00.320
And here's what she said.
After sitting next to Mr Gladstone,

708
00:42:00.440 --> 00:42:03.350
I thought he was the cleverest person in England.

709
00:42:03.950 --> 00:42:06.710
But after sitting next to Mr Disraeli,

710
00:42:06.890 --> 00:42:11.890
I thought I was the cleverest person in England with all of these skills.

711
00:42:12.860 --> 00:42:17.150
I hope that you will use them to gift people.
Amazing interactions.

712
00:42:17.510 --> 00:42:20.330
I think when we read someone's microexpressions and we respond to them,

713
00:42:20.570 --> 00:42:23.510
when we look at their personality trait and we look at them through their lens,

714
00:42:23.511 --> 00:42:24.344
not ours,

715
00:42:24.440 --> 00:42:28.730
I've met as one of the best ways to make them feel truly honored and not as the

716
00:42:28.731 --> 00:42:33.290
best way to interact.
So a couple of next steps packed a lot into today.

717
00:42:33.740 --> 00:42:35.480
Try to tackle one skill at a time.

718
00:42:35.481 --> 00:42:37.490
So if there's one thing that really resonated with you,

719
00:42:37.491 --> 00:42:40.940
start with that and then moved on to list.
With the micro expressions,

720
00:42:41.150 --> 00:42:45.170
it's very hard to try to spot all four of the ones we learned at once.

721
00:42:45.440 --> 00:42:49.840
Pick one say this week I'm going to look for just contempt or this week I'm

722
00:42:49.841 --> 00:42:50.990
going to look just for anger.

723
00:42:51.260 --> 00:42:54.500
It starts to retrain your brain because our brain is a muscle on how to spot

724
00:42:54.501 --> 00:42:59.270
those facial expressions.
Seconds.
The learning does not have to stop here.

725
00:42:59.360 --> 00:43:03.350
This work changed my life.
I'm a recovering awkward person.

726
00:43:03.620 --> 00:43:05.360
I could not truly,

727
00:43:05.660 --> 00:43:09.080
I could not read facial expressions for the life of me that just did not come

728
00:43:09.081 --> 00:43:09.914
naturally to me.

729
00:43:10.130 --> 00:43:13.250
It was not until I discovered this science where I was finally able to interact

730
00:43:13.251 --> 00:43:16.670
with people because I was able to study them in a systematic way,

731
00:43:16.671 --> 00:43:20.480
a science based way.
So we have so much free practicing the website,

732
00:43:20.630 --> 00:43:23.450
all seven of the micro expressions all set on the mega refresher in the book.

733
00:43:23.630 --> 00:43:26.990
Anyway,
I can help.
I am here to help and lastly,

734
00:43:27.500 --> 00:43:30.980
please use your powers for good and not evil.

735
00:43:31.790 --> 00:43:34.910
I'm happy to take a couple of questions before.
Yes sir.

736
00:43:38.360 --> 00:43:42.500
Yes.
Okay.
So great.
So,
oh,

737
00:43:43.310 --> 00:43:47.180
the question was I love to play poker.
Are there any tips for poker players?

738
00:43:47.750 --> 00:43:49.610
So I yes,
I,
I'll send you an article.

739
00:43:49.611 --> 00:43:52.700
I have an article on poker playing specifically what poker players need to look

740
00:43:52.701 --> 00:43:54.430
out for is definitely the micro expression.

741
00:43:54.431 --> 00:43:57.920
So if someone hates their hand they are more likely to show contempt or

742
00:43:57.921 --> 00:43:59.750
discussed.
Usually not anger,

743
00:43:59.751 --> 00:44:02.210
usually not sadness but contemporary discuss if you don't like your hand.

744
00:44:02.510 --> 00:44:05.810
But really what you're looking for are what are called micro messages.

745
00:44:06.140 --> 00:44:07.970
So micro messages are more the bodies.

746
00:44:07.971 --> 00:44:10.730
We didn't talk a lot about body language today.
We talked to her about the face.

747
00:44:11.090 --> 00:44:14.510
There are two buckets.
There are micro negatives and micro positives.

748
00:44:14.570 --> 00:44:17.780
So when you look at a micro message,
these are the little signals we send off.

749
00:44:18.080 --> 00:44:21.110
Micro negatives are any kind of self touch.

750
00:44:21.170 --> 00:44:24.640
So the more someone is self touching,
usually the lower their confidences,

751
00:44:24.650 --> 00:44:25.850
the lower their competences.

752
00:44:26.180 --> 00:44:29.180
Anytime we self touch on our arms and produces oxytocin,

753
00:44:29.330 --> 00:44:30.530
which helps us stay calm.

754
00:44:30.990 --> 00:44:33.960
So if someone has their trying to keep themselves nice and calm,

755
00:44:33.961 --> 00:44:36.600
the trying to keep themselves nice and calm there are literally trying to

756
00:44:36.601 --> 00:44:39.000
produce oxytocin to keep them relaxed.

757
00:44:39.001 --> 00:44:42.850
I where oxytocin around my neck and my husband was,
he might,

758
00:44:42.860 --> 00:44:45.320
my husband is my favorite chemical.
That's a sign is right.

759
00:44:45.321 --> 00:44:47.490
I have favorite Kamilah has,
it's like I want to get your necklace.

760
00:44:47.491 --> 00:44:50.190
I was like no hearts oxytocin.
So um,

761
00:44:50.220 --> 00:44:52.940
you're looking for those micro negatives or micro positives.

762
00:44:52.941 --> 00:44:57.480
So self soothing is a micro negative.
Micro positives are liens,
nods,

763
00:44:57.570 --> 00:44:59.700
half smiles and more open body language.

764
00:44:59.701 --> 00:45:03.000
The moment someone's opens up their body,
roll their shoulders back,

765
00:45:03.180 --> 00:45:05.400
have more space between themselves and the table,

766
00:45:05.640 --> 00:45:06.960
that's when you're going to see much more of those.

767
00:45:06.960 --> 00:45:11.960
It's subtle indication of positive feelings the way myself,

768
00:45:12.750 --> 00:45:14.970
ah,
what are good techniques?
Neck,
give away myself.

769
00:45:15.240 --> 00:45:19.740
The best thing that you would want to practice is hearing extremely bad news and

770
00:45:19.741 --> 00:45:21.540
not having any physical movements at all.

771
00:45:22.890 --> 00:45:26.850
So you need to know like each of us,
it's true.
Each of us have tells,
right?

772
00:45:26.851 --> 00:45:30.870
So we do a lot of lie detection.
Everyone has a basic nonverbal tell,

773
00:45:30.871 --> 00:45:33.960
usually two to three they do every time they lie or every time they feel an

774
00:45:33.961 --> 00:45:35.610
intense set of nerves.

775
00:45:36.300 --> 00:45:39.990
We've found there are 33 common red flags they are,

776
00:45:39.991 --> 00:45:43.020
these are the most common red flags that people show when they're lying.

777
00:45:43.290 --> 00:45:45.780
So you would want to tape yourself hearing very,

778
00:45:45.781 --> 00:45:49.290
very bad news or getting a really bad hand or losing a lot of money,

779
00:45:49.380 --> 00:45:51.270
but it has to be real stakes,
right?

780
00:45:51.271 --> 00:45:53.850
Like real stakes can be play and see what you do.

781
00:45:53.880 --> 00:45:56.070
Like right now you're crossing your arms in front of you,

782
00:45:56.071 --> 00:45:59.790
so I guess it's a blocking technique.
You also cross your leg over your,

783
00:45:59.850 --> 00:46:02.770
over your knee.
So I would guess that that's probably a negative number.
Walt,

784
00:46:02.820 --> 00:46:04.710
I'll take you off the spot.
That's probably what I would guess.

785
00:46:05.850 --> 00:46:07.290
That's what I would guess as maybe some of the,

786
00:46:07.320 --> 00:46:09.690
some of the nonverbal tells a that you'd want to fight with.

787
00:46:13.100 --> 00:46:17.130
Okay,
good.
Good,
good.
Good job.
I won't call it,
you know,
I was like,

788
00:46:17.131 --> 00:46:19.500
I'm not asking a question now.
There's no way.
Well,

789
00:46:19.501 --> 00:46:21.870
I will be here afterwards signing books.

790
00:46:21.871 --> 00:46:24.720
Thank you so much for giving me your hour and thanks for having me at Google.
